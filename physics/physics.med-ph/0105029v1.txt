The scaling behaviors of the human electroencephalogram
(EEG) time series are studied using detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis. Two scaling regions are found in nearly every chan-
nel for all subjects examined. The scatter plot of the scaling
exponents for all channels (up to 129) reveals the complicated
structure of a subject’s brain activity. Moment analyses are
performed to extract the gross features of all the scaling ex-
ponents, and another universal scaling behavior is identiﬁed.
A one-parameter description is found to characterize the ﬂuc-
tuation properties of the nonlinear behaviors of the brain dy-
namics.

In the study of electrical activities of the brain recorded
by electroencephalogram (EEG) various methods have
been used to extract diﬀerent aspects of the neuronal
dynamics from the scalp potentials. They range from
the traditional linear analysis that involves frequency de-
composition, topographic mapping, etc. [1,2], to time-
frequency analysis that uses wavelet transform [3], to
nonlinear analysis that is particularly suitable for learn-
ing about the chaotic behavior of the brain [4] or
for quantifying physiological conditions in nonlinear-
dynamics terms [5,6]. In this paper we discuss the scaling
behavior of the ﬂuctuations in EEG in nonlinear analysis
and show the existence of new features in brain dynam-
ics hitherto unrecognized. Moreover, we propose a global
measure of the spatio-temporal signals that has potential
utility in clinical and cognitive diagnostics.

Apart from being more suitable to analyze non-
stationary time series, the study of scaling behavior em-
phasizes the relationship across time scales and provides
a diﬀerent description of the time series than the con-
ventional Fourier power spectrum. Conveniently it also
liberates our result from the dependence on the magni-
tude of the voltage recorded by each probe. We aim to
ﬁnd what is universal among all channels as well as what
varies among them. The former is obviously important
by virtue of its universality for a given subject; how that
universal quantity varies from subject to subject would
clearly be interesting. The latter, which is a measure
that varies from channel to channel, is perhaps even more
interesting, since that quantity has brain anatomical cor-
relates once the scalp potentials have been deconvolved
to the cortical surface.

Our procedure is to focus initially on one channel at a
time. Thus it is a study of the local temporal behavior
and the determination of a few parameters (scaling expo-
nents) that eﬀectively summarize the ﬂuctuation proper-
ties of the time series. The second phase of our procedure
is to describe the global behavior of all channels and to
arrive at one number that summarizes the variability of
these temporal measures across the entire scalp surface.
This dramatic data reduction necessarily trades detail for
succinctness, but such reduction is exactly what is needed
to allow easy discrimination between brain states.

The speciﬁc method we use in the ﬁrst phase is de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA). This analysis is not
new. It was proposed for the investigation of correlation
properties in non-stationary time series and applied to
the studies of heartbeat [7] and DNA nucleotides [8]. It
has also been applied to EEG [9], but with somewhat
diﬀerent emphases than those presented here. Since the
analysis considers only the ﬂuctuations from the local
linear trends, it is insensitive to spurious correlations in-
troduced by non-stationary external trends. By examin-
ing the scaling behavior one can learn about the nature
of short-range and long-range correlations, which are a
salient aspect of the brain dynamics from the viewpoint
of complex systems theory.

Let an EEG time series be denoted by y(t), where t
is discrete time ranging from 1 to T . Divide the entire
range of t to be investigated into B equal bins, discard-
ing any remainder, so that each bin has k = ﬂoor(T /B)
time points. Within each bin, labeled b (b = 1, · · · , B),
perform a least-square ﬁt of y(t) by a straight line, yb(t),
i.e., yb(t) = Linear-ﬁt[y(t)] for (b − 1)k < t ≤ bk. That is
the semi-local trend for the bth bin. Combine yb(t) for
all B bins and denote the B straight segments by

y(k, t) =

yb(t) θ(t − (b − 1)k) θ(bk − t)

for 1 ≤ t ≤ kB. Deﬁne

F 2(k) =

F (k) is then the RMS ﬂuctuation from the semi-local
trends in B bins each having k time points, and is also
a measure of the ﬂuctuation in each bin averaged over B

bins. The study of the dependence of F (k) on the bin
size k is the essence of DFA [7,8]. If it is a power-law
behavior

and subjects, it is a feature of EEG that conveys an im-
portant property of the brain activity and should not be
ignored.

then the scaling exponent α is an indicator of the power-
law correlations of the ﬂuctuations in EEG, and is inde-
pendent of the magnitude of y(t) or any spurious trend
externally introduced.

Resting EEG data were collected for six subjects us-
ing a 128-channel commercial EEG system, with scalp-
electrode impedences ranging from 10 to 40 kΩ. The
acquisition rate is 250 points/sec with hardware ﬁltering
set between 0.1 and 100 Hz. After acquisition, T ≈ 10s
lengths of simultaneous time series in all channels are
chosen, free of artifacts such as eye blink and head move-
ments. At each time point, the data are re-referenced
to the average over all electrodes. This approximates
the potentials relative to inﬁnity, and provides a more
interpretable measure of local brain activity [2]. We in-
vestigate the range of k from 3 to 500 in approximately
equal steps of ln k.

The vertical scales of Ch 1 and Ch 2 are shifted upward by
60 and 30 µV, respectively.

In Fig. 1 we show three typical time series y(t) in three
widely separated channels for subject A, labeled 1-3, for
brevity. While it is clear that both channels 2 and 3
have substantial 10 Hz oscillations after 0.2 s, it is much
less apparent that there exist any scaling behaviors in
all three channels. The corresponding values of F (k) are
shown in the log-log plot in Fig. 2. Evidently, the strik-
ing feature is that there are two scaling regions with a
discernible bend when the two slopes in the two regions
are distinctly diﬀerent. With rare exceptions this feature
is found in all channels for all subjects. Admittedly, the
extents of the scaling regions are not wide, so the behav-
ior does not meet the qualiﬁcation for scaling in large
critical systems or in fractal geometrical objects. How-
ever, since the behavior is so universal across channels

FIG. 2. F (k) vs k for the three channels in Fig. 1. The
vertical scales of Ch 1 and Ch 2 are shifted upwards by 1.0
and 0.5 units, respectively.

To quantify the scaling behavior, we perform a linear
ﬁt in Region I for 1 < ln k < 3 and denote the slope
by α1, and similarly in Region II for 4 < ln k < 6 with
slope denoted by α2. Knowing the two straight lines in
each channel allows us to determine the location of their
intercept, ln κ, which we deﬁne as the position of the bend
in ln k. We ﬁnd that, whereas α1 and α2 can ﬂuctuate
widely from channel to channel, κ is limited to a narrow
range in most subjects. The average values of ln κ for the
six subjects are 3.40, 3.47, 3.02, 2.94, 2.63, and 3.11.

Since the only quantity in our analysis that has a scale
is k, the size of the bin on the time axis in which ﬂuctu-
ations from the semi-local trend are calculated, the spe-
ciﬁc scale κ must correspond roughly to a particular fre-
quency f . If the data acquisition rate is denoted by r,
then f = r/κ. For r = 250 points/sec, and ln κ = 3.4, we
get f = 8.34 Hz. That is near the midpoint separating
the traditional α (8-13 Hz) and θ (5-8 Hz) EEG frequency
bands. Region I is then at higher frequencies, Region II
lower. Thus in this nonlinear analysis we have found the
existence of a speciﬁc frequency in every channel that
separates diﬀerent scaling behaviors. A change in scal-
ing exponent in physical systems is often attributable to
distinct dynamical processes underlying the generation
of the time series. An interesting question is how this
ﬁnding relates to EEG neurophysiology.

We now exhibit the values of α1 and α2 of all channels
for subject A in a scatter plot in Fig. 3. They vary in
the ranges: 0.21 < α1 < 1.43 and 0.042 < α2 < 0.477.
Whereas α1 is widely distributed, α2 is sharply peaked at
0.1 and has a long tail. The value of α = 0.5 corresponds
to random walk with no correlation among the various
time points. For α 6= 0.5 there are correlations: Region
I corresponds to short-range correlation, Region II long-

m
range, with κ giving a quantitative demarkation between
the two. It is natural to conjecture that high deviations of
the α values from the average could be caused by patho-
logical conditions. Since the two scaling regions have
corresponding frequency bands, one would likely want to
focus on Region II to study brain states characterized by
marked δ (1-4 Hz) and θ (5-8 Hz) activity. Sleep and
cerebral ischemic stroke are two such examples.

FIG. 3. Scatter plot of α2 vs α1 for subject A. The three

channels exhibited in Figs. 1 and 2 are shown as big circles.

So far our consideration has focused on the temporal
properties of the time series in each channel. The scat-
ter plot of α2 vs α1 provides a view of the complicated
activities in all channels over the entire scalp. While the
detailed spatial structure may be of interest for relating
the values of αi to brain anatomy, there is also a need
for a general, overall description of all the pairs αi. A
global measure for each subject could be of great use to
specialists and non-specialists alike. To that end, we now
consider the relationship among the αi values, or more
precisely, the ﬂuctuation of αi.

Let x be either α1 or α2, and N be the total number of
channels whose αi values are under consideration. Since
no value of αi has been found to exceed 1.5 in the subjects
we have examined, we consider the interval 0 ≤ x ≤
1.5. Divide that interval into M equal cells, which for
deﬁniteness we take to be M = 150 here. Let the cells
be labeled by m = 1, · · · , M , each having the size δx =
1.5/M . Denote the number of channels whose x values
are in the mth cell by nm. Deﬁne

Pm = nm / N.

(4)

It is the fraction of channels whose x values are in the
range (m − 1) δx ≤ x < m δx. By deﬁnition, we have
M
m=1 Pm = 1. In Fig. 4 we show as an illustration the
two graphs of Pm for subject A, three of whose EEG
P
times series are shown in Fig. 1. The two graphs corre-
spond to α1 and α2, and are, in essence, the projections
of the scatter plot in Fig. 3 onto the α1 and α2 axes.

Instead of studying the complicated structures of the

these moments are averages of (m/m)q, where m is the
average-m, they are not very sensitive to m itself. They
contain the essence of the ﬂuctuation properties of α1,2
in all channels.

In principle, it is possible to examine also the moments
for q < 0, which would reveal the properties of Pm at
low values of m. However, the accuracy of our data is
not too reliable for low-k analysis, since the 60 Hz noise
due to ambient electric and magnetic ﬁelds has not been

can be shown by plotting them against each other in a
log-log graph. In Fig. 6 we show the straightline behavior
for three of the six subjects, all of whose EEG time series
have been analyzed in the same method described here.

This remarkable behavior is valid for all subjects exam-

Thus we have discovered a measure that characterizes all

intriguing possibilities of the method presented here sug-
gest extensive application of the analysis to many more
subjects and for further investigation on what the scal-
ing behaviors of the spatio-temporal EEG reveal. Such
behaviors can undoubtedly be useful in guiding future
theoretical development.

To summarize, we have studied the scaling properties
of the ﬂuctuations in the time series, and found a number
of features previously unrecognized in power spectrum
analysis. The characterization of the temporal behavior
of each channel by just two parameters, α1 and α2, has
led to the discovery of the η exponent. Although η is ob-
tained by considering the global property of all channels,
we envisage its extension to the study of local properties
by the application of the moment analysis to partitioned
regions of the scalp. Future possibilities of this approach
to the investigation of EEG signals seem bountiful.

We label the six subjects whom we have examined as

labels.

At this stage of our investigation we have not yet ar-
rived at a point where we can give a deﬁnitive correlation
between the values of η and some speciﬁc aspect of the
brain activity. It is, nevertheless, of interest to note that
the subjects A-C were regarded as healthy control sub-
jects, while D-F have each had recent encounter with
ischemic stroke.

Before any tentative correlations may be inferred, we
emphasize the need for caution since many factors were
involved in data acquisition, e.g., varying degrees of
awakeness of the subjects. Clinical and cognitive appli-
cation is not the main object of this paper. However, the

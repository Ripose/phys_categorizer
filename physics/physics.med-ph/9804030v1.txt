We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish with a complete certainty between healthy subjects
and patients with various dysfunctions of the cardiac nervous system by way of multiresolutional
wavelet transform of RR intervals. We repeated the study of Thurner et al on diﬀerent ensemble of
subjects. We show that reconstructed series using a ﬁlter which discards wavelet coeﬃcients related
with higher scales enables one to classify individuals for which the method otherwise is inconclusive.
We suggest a delimiting diagnostic value of the standard deviation of the ﬁltered, reconstructed RR
interval time series in the range of ∼ 0.035 (for the above mentioned ﬁlter), below which individuals
are at risk.

I. INTRODUCTION

Measurement of heart rate (HR) and evaluation of its
rhythmicity have been used for a long time as a simple
clinical indicator [1]. The main adaptive regulation of
the sinus node function and thereby the HR, is exerted
by the autonomic nervous system. The sinus node of
the heart is a major organ in the integrated control of
cardiovascular function. HR abnormality may therefore
be an early or principle sign of disease or malfunction.

Research from the last decade indicates that a quan-
tiﬁcation of the discrete beat to beat variations in HR -
heart rate variability (HRV) may be used more directly to
estimate eﬀerent autonomic activity to the heart and the
integrity of this cardiovascular control system [2]. The
ﬁnding that power spectral analysis of HRV could be used
as a marker of cardiac autonomic outﬂow to the heart,
was considered a breakthrough for clinical research [3,4].
Autonomic dysfunction is an important factor in a
number of conditions.
In diabetes, an abnormality in
autonomic nervous function signals an adverse progno-
sis and risk of subsequent heart disease. Recognition of
early dysfunction is therefore important. In overt heart
disease autonomic imbalance is of signiﬁcant importance
in the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death. Abnor-
mal autonomic balance is an important prognostic factor.
In heart failure this control system may be signiﬁcantly
deranged.

Techniques which can discriminate the healthy HRV
proﬁle from a sick one are therefore highly desirable. So
far this has not been accomplished, as a considerable
overlap between healthy and sick, (i.e. healthy and dia-
betes) [5] or high and low risk heart disease patients [6],
have been reported. The time series used for HRV analy-
sis are derived from 24-hour ECG recordings. These are

clinically widely used and oﬀer important additional in-
formation. However, several problems have limited the
use and interpretation of the spectral analysis results.
The ambulatory time segments inherently lack station-
arity. Furthermore, they often include transients caused
by artifacts, ectopic beats, noise, tape speed errors which
may have signiﬁcant impact on the power spectrum [7].
This signiﬁcantly limits the sensitivity of this technique,
and thus may limit its applicability.

II. METHODS

One of the most successful techniques to analyze non
stationary time series is the Multiresolution Wavelet
Analysis [8–14]. This technique was recently utilized in
order to analyze a sequence of RR intervals [14,15]. Ref.
[14] identiﬁes diﬀerent scaling properties in healthy and
heartfailure patients. Thurner et al [15] used a similar
procedure but focus instead of scaling on the values of
the variance. For the scale windows of m = 4 and m = 5
heartbeats, the standard deviations of the wavelet coef-
ﬁcients for normal individuals and heart failure patients
were divided into two disjoint sets. In this way the au-
thors of ref. [15] succeeded to classify subjects from a
test group as either belonging to the heart failure or the
normal group, and that with a 100% accuracy.

The Discrete Wavelet transform is a mathematical
recipe acting on a data vector of length 2m, m = 1, 2, . . .
and transforming it into a diﬀerent vector of the same
length. It is based on recursive sums and diﬀerences of
the vector components; the sums can be compared with
the low frequency amplitudes in the Fourier transform,
and the diﬀerences with the high frequency amplitudes.
It is similar to the Fourier transform in respect of or-

1

thogonality and invertibility. The wavelets are the unit
vectors i.e., they correspond to the sine and cosine ba-
sis functions of the Fourier transform. One of the basic
advantages of wavelets is that an event can be simultane-
ously described in the frequency domain as well as in the
time domain, unlike the usual Fourier transform where
an event is accurately described either in the frequency
or in the time domain. This diﬀerence allows a multi
resolution analysis of data with diﬀerent behaviour on
diﬀerent scales. This dual localization renders functions
with intrinsic inaccuracies into reliable data when they
are transformed into the wavelet domain. Large classes
of biological data (such as ECG series and RR intervals)
may be analysed by this method.

Heart failure patients generally have very low HRV val-
ues. To further explore the potential possibilities of the
Multiresolutional Wavelet Analysis we have investigated
a test group of 33 persons, 12 patients and 21 healthy
subjects. The patient group consisted of 10 diabetic pa-
tients which are otherwise healthy and without symp-
toms or signs of heart disease, one patient which have
had a myocardial infarction and one heart transplanted
patient in whom the autonomic nerves to the heart have
been cut.

We have in the present study applied the same tech-
nique as used in ref. [15] and have by Multiresolution
Wavelet Analysis been able to identify correctly all but
one of 33 test persons as belonging to the group of healthy
subjects or subjects suﬀering from myocardial infarction.
The heart transplanted patient was included as a subject
displaying the ultimative cardiac autonomic dysfunction
- complete denervation.

perform an Inverse Wavelet Transform, but retain only
a speciﬁc scale in the reconstruction of the time series;
a complete separation is observed for m = 4 or m = 5.
In this way a reconstructed and ﬁltered time series is
obtained and a comparison with the original time se-
ries shows a substantial diﬀerence in amplitude between
sick/healthy subjects relative to the diﬀerence found in
the original RR interval time series. The choice of m = 4
or m = 5 was motivated by the ﬁndings in ref. [15] and
by our own results.

III. RESULTS

We have calculated the standard deviation σwave for
Daubechies 10-tap wavelet versus the scale m, 1 ≤ m ≤
10, for 33 persons. In accordance with ref. [15] we ﬁnd
that for 4 ≤ m ≤ 6 the σwave separate the two classes of
subjects and hence provide a clinically signiﬁcant mea-
sure of the presence of cardiac autonomic dysfunction
with a 97% sensitivity. This supports in a convincing
way the ﬁndings of ref. [15]. We have been able to con-
ﬁrm this trend with other wavelets.

The main result of this study is however the possibil-
ity to display the standard deviation of the RR inter-
val amplitude vs. the beat number in the reconstructed,
ﬁltered time series. This standard deviation, here de-
noted by σf ilter, can be used to obtain a separation of
sick/healthy subjects.

In ﬁg. 1 we display the RR intervals vs. the beat num-
ber of a normal subject. The wavelet technique cleans
the highest and lowest frequencies from the overall pic-
ture. The highest frequencies contain noise and the low-
est frequencies contain mainly external inﬂuences on the
HR pattern like movement and slower trends in HR level,
which are not necessarily reﬂective of autonomic nervous
activity. After the removal of these frequencies one is left
with the characteristic frequencies of the heart.

Fig.

2 shows the standard deviation σwave for a
Daubechies 10-tap wavelet as a function of the scale num-
ber m. The almost total separation between sick and
healthy subjects is obvious.

Patient #1, falling into the range of sick patients, has
a very low HRV both on a 24-hour scale and short term.
The patient is a survivor of a heart infarct and is at high
risk of sudden cardiac death.

Patient #2 has the lowest σwave values in the range
4 ≤ m ≤ 6. He has undergone a heart transplant; the
nerves to the heart have been disconnected and there is
almost no HRV.

Patient #3 is a diabetic patient, who is classiﬁed by
the wavelet technique as a high risk patient. Diabetic
patients with abnormal cardiac autonomic function have
an adverse prognosis and increased risk of heart disease.
Patient #4, also a diabetic, seems to be less at risk.
His σwave is near the transition between healthy and sick
subjects.

The method used in ref. [15] fails for subject #5, who
appears in the risk group, although he had no evidence
of diabetes or heart disease.

healthy subjects is apparent. The fact that the σf ilter re-
main almost constant for scales between 4 and 6 for each
individual hints to the possibility that the correspond-
ing frequencies are characteristic of those at which the
autonomic nervous system works.

IV. CONCLUSION

Our study supports the conjecture of ref. [15] that
healthy subjects exhibit greater ﬂuctuations (larger
σwave values) than patients. This diﬀerence in ﬂuctu-
ations become most evident on the scale 4 to 5 (corre-
sponding to windows of 16 and 32 heartbeats), but in our
study it is apparent at all scales from 1 to 7 (windows of
2 to 128 heartbeats).

The most distinct diﬀerence between sick and healthy
individuals appears in the amplitude changes in the ’re-
constructed’ time series, where the windows of 16, 32
and 64 heartbeats contribute in a similar way. Letting
the window be as small as 24 heartbeats is enough to
allow the healthy group to show substantial variation in
the size of RR intervals implying a large σ value, but
is at the same time too small a window to let the sick
cardiac autonomic nervous system introduce signiﬁcant
variations in the length of the RR intervals and hence
allows it only to reach a σ value essentially smaller than
the healthy heart.

The ﬁnal conclusion of this study is that in order to
obtain a complete separation between healthy subjects
and patients one has to consider a range of scales (as
shown in ﬁg. 6) instead of only one scale (as in ﬁgs. 2
and 3). This implies that, σf ilter as in ﬁg. 6 can be

Figs. 5a and 5b show the Fourier transforms for the
time series displayed in ﬁgs. 4a and 4b, respectively.
These power spectra appear similar, however diﬀer in
their respective order of magnitude. Clearly, the recon-
structed ﬁltered time series are distinct by the amplitude
as well as the broadness of their Fourier transforms.

In ﬁg. 6 we have obtained a complete separation be-
tween the sick and healthy subjects by application of a
ﬁlter which is created by retaining wavelet coeﬃcients
with scales 1 ≤ m ≤ 6. This ﬁlter was motivated by the

used as a diagnostic indicator, with a delimiting value of
∼ 0.035 (for the above mentioned ﬁlter), below which the
persons have abnormal cardiac autonomic function and
will be at risk.

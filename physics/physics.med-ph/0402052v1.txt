In this work we develop a new method of diagnosing the nervous system diseases and a new

approach in studying human gait dynamics with the help of the theory of discrete non-Markov ran-

dom processes [31]-[34]. The stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds and the statistical non-Markov eﬀects

in the time series of the dynamics of human gait are considered. We carried out the comparative

analysis of the data of four age groups of healthy people: children (from 3 to 10 year olds), teenagers

(from 11 to 14 year oulds), young people (from 21 up to 29 year oulds), elderly persons (from 71

to 77 year olds) and Parkinson patients. The full data set are analyzed with the help of the phase

portraits of the four dynamic variables, the power spectra of the initial time correlation function

and the memory functions of junior orders, the three ﬁrst points in the spectra of the statistical

non-Markov parameter. The received results allow to deﬁne the predisposition of the probationers to

deﬂections in the central nervous system caused by Parkinson’s disease. We have found out distinct

diﬀerencies between the ﬁve submitted groups. On this basis we oﬀer a new method of diagnostics

and forecasting Parkinson’s disease.

INTRODUCTION

A wide class of physical and biological systems exhibits complex dynamics, related to presence of many factors
interacting over a wide range of time or space scales [1]-[30], [35]-[38]. Physiologic signals generating by complex
self-regulating systems are extemely inhomogeneous, unsteady and ﬂuctuating in an irregular and chaotic manner.
Among them the locomotion is active movements made by a person which considerably exceed the norm typical
of the size of their body. Walking is the most widespread form of human locomotion. The study of locomotion
dynamics of a human present great interest for modern biomedicine and physiology [11]-[30], [35]-[38]. The number
of people with various infringements of locomotion activity increases annually. The basic actual problems connected
with these researches of the human’s gait dynamics and walking are cosidered in the papers of J. Hausdorﬀ [9]-[15].
Here, we deal with the changes of the fractal dynamics of patients’ gait [9], [10], the increase of instability of elderly

people’s gait [9], [11], [15] the steady long-range correlation of ﬂuctuations of young people’s step interval [14] and the
development of children’s gait dynamics [16]. As a rule similar researches are carried out on the basis of the traditional
biomechanical methods [1], [2], [18], [21], [22], for example on the records of electric signals in the muscles of legs
of a human at walking [17]. Though experimental techniques are well developed at present, the theoretical analysis
of the measurements is inadequate so far. The dynamics of the electric signals of the muscle tremors is related to a

class of nonlinear, nonstationary and nonergodic processes. While analyzing the electricactivity of the muscle tremors
it is necessary to take into account the discrete non-Markov properties of time change of the signals as well as the
sudden alternation of the behavioral regimes. This is the reason why traditional methods of nonlinear dynamics are
not suﬃciently sensitive for the purpose of distinction between diﬀerent chaotic regimes. The use of the statistical
method of discrete non-Markov random processes [31]-[34] in the similar researches allows to receive the more detailed
characteristics of deﬂections in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the motor system and to diﬀerentiate the
parameters for diﬀerent age groups.

This method also allows to ﬁnd out the predisposition to Parkinson’s disease as early as possible even of young
children. It is of great practical value as it allows to diagnose and prevent the development of the disease at its early

stages and reduce the danger of more serious complications, that might set in without appropriate treatment.

Parkinson’s disease is a chronic one, a slowly progressing disease caused by the lesion of the extrapyramidal system.
The extrapyramidal system includes the system of nucleus of a brain and the motor ways which are responsible for
involuntary automatic regulation and coordination of the complex motor acts, and also the regulation of a muscular
tone, the maintenance of pose and the organization of impellent manifestation. It is impossible to establish the cause
of the disease at an early stage . Therefore the possibility to diagnose predisposition to the given disease at an early
stage is very important. As a rule the disease reveals itself at the age of 50-60, but there are exceptions. 160 in 100000
people suﬀer from this disease.

Parkinsonism is a syndrome of progressing lesion of the nervous system. This syndrome reveals itself in the decrease
of the general motor activity, the slowness of movement, the tremor and the increase of muscular tone. The muscular
tone has two components: a component related to the maintenance of a pose is a ”pose tone”, another component
related to reﬂexion is a ”reﬂex tone”. The disease can be complicated with the syndrome of epidemic encephalitis,
atherosclerosis of brain vessels caused by insuﬃciency of brain blood circulation, tumors of big hemispheres and
craniocerebral traumas. Less often the disease is connected with intoxication caused by manganese, carbon monoxide,
lead and other medical substances products.

The basic external attributes of the disease are reveal themselves through limitation of the general motor activity.
The movements of the patients are slowed down and performed with diﬃculty, their speech is monotonous and hardly

audible, the face expression is unemotional. While walking the patients make short steps, there is no concomitant
motion of their hands and the phenomenon of propulsia can be observed (inertia movement). The tone of skeletal
muscles increases and as the result the movements are constrained. The characteristic pose of the patient is as follows:
the body is bent forward, the chin dropped onto the chest, the hands are at the side of the body bent in elbows.
Huntington’s disease also refers to the group under study as it is a certain kind of walking resembling a dancing gait.
Now more than 10 million people in the advanced countries suﬀer from Parkinson’s disease. The symptoms of the
disease reveal themselves as tremor and rigidity, caused by mortiﬁcation of cells in the certain area of human brain
named substantia nigra. Neurons from this area transfer nerve impulses by means of doufamin mediator. Owing to

the destruction of the nervous cages of substantia nigra changes take place in other areas of the brain responsible for
motor activity. The condition of the Parkinson patient can be alleviated, if the lack of doufamin is ﬁlled up. However
the process of neuron destruction continues.

It is supposed, that the ”cause” of disease is an unknown toxic substance contained in the environment. Later on
narcotic substances, stimulating the phenomena very similar to the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, were discovered.
Even tea, mint and herbicides contain substances which in a combination with the natural loss of the nervous cages of
substantia nigra can cause Parkinson’s disease. The eﬀect of the substantia nigra is thought to have the eﬀect similar
to the eﬀect of toxic substances. It is connected not only with the destruction of the brain caused by Parkinson’s
disease, but cames as a natural ”process” of human ageing.

On April, 16, 2002 ”Decode Genetics” research company has declared that the deﬁne gene is responsible for
Parkinson’s disease. If the results of the discovery are put into practice, the new means of combatting this disease

will appear.

It seems very curious and rather odd, that rats and mice are less sensitive to all the factors listed above, than

people and primates. It is due to the special rodent brain structure.

In Refs. [11]-[30] various methods were oﬀered for ﬁnding the distinction of motor functions of diﬀerent age groups
and diﬀerences between patients and healthy people.
In this work we present a new method of detecting strong
diﬀerences existing in diﬀerent age groups and the means of diagnostics Parkinson’s disease at its early stages. A
quantitative analysis of human gait dynamics show, that the description of motor processes can not be executed on
the basis of the fundamental methods of statistical physics. The most essential moments in time series describing the
behaviour of real live systems are their discreteness, nonstationarity, nonergodicity and non-Markovity.

Therefore for the description of the complex systems it is necessary to use the theory of random non-Markov
discrete processes [31, 32, 33, 34]. The approach proposed in these works allows to deﬁne a wide spectrum of dynamic
characteristics for the majority of real objects. This method [31] is used in the given work for the research of non-
Markov statistical eﬀects in time discrete series of human gait. The generalization will consist in taking into account
the non-stationarity of stochastic random processes and their further application to the analysis of human gait by
means of time correlation function (TCF) method.

One of the key moments in the spectral approach in the analysis of stochastic processes is the use of normalized

TCF

a0(t) =

hA(T )A(T + t)i
h|A(T)|2i

where the time T is the beginning of a time serial, the angular brackets indicate a scalar product of vectors, and
vector A(t) is a state vector of a complex system, |A(t)| is the length of vector A(t). The above-stated designation
is true only for stationary systems. In a non-stationary case Eqn.(1) is not true and should be changed. The concept
of TCF can be generalized in case of discrete non-stationary sequence of signals. For this purpose it is necessary to
take advantage of the standard deﬁnition of the correlation coeﬃcient for the two random signals X and Y in the
probability theory

ρ =

hXYi
σX σY

, σX = |X|, σY = |Y|,

In Eqn. (2) the multicomponent vectors X, Y will be generated from ﬂuctuations of signals x and y accordingly,
y is proportional to the dispersion of signals x and y, and values |X|, |Y| represent the lengths of vectors X, Y,
σ2
x, σ2
correspondingly. Therefore the generalization of concept of TCF (1) for non-stationary processes can be served by
the function [33]

For the quantitative description of non-stationarity with accordance of Eqns. (1), (3) it is convenient to introduce
the function of non-stationarity

a(T, t) =

hA(T )A(T + t)i
|A(T )||A(T + t)|

.

γ(T, t) =

|A(T + t)|
|A(T )|

=

σ2(T + t)

1/2

(cid:26)

σ2(T ) (cid:27)

which one is equal to the relation of lengths of the vectors of the ﬁnal and initial states. In case of stationary process
the dispersion does not vary with the time (or its variations are very weak).

In this work we consider only a few problems connected with the description of the human’s gait dynamics. The

The article is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we consider the brief description of the statistical theory of
nonstationary discrete non-Markov processes in complex systems [31, 32, 33]. Section 3 contains the description of
the initial data about electric signals in muscles of legs of healthy people of various age groups and Parkinson patients.
The received results and their analysis are given in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to summary and conclusions of
this work.

II. STATISTICAL THEORY OF NONSTATIONARY DISCRETE NON-MARKOV PROCESSES IN

COMPLEX SYSTEMS. BASIC CONCEPTS AND DEFINITION

The brief description of the statistical theory of the discrete non-Markov non-stationary processes for the complex
systems of wildlife is presented in this Section. The theory and the description of quantities used here can be found
in the works of authors published earlier [31]-[34].

While analyzing complex systems we obtain discrete equidistant series of experimental data, the so-called random

variable

X = {x(T ), x(T + τ ), x(T + 2τ ), · · · , x(T + kτ ), · · · , x(T + τ N − τ )}.

(5)

It corresponds to a measured signal during the time (N − 1)τ , where τ is a temporary sampling interval of a signal.
For the dynamical analysis, it is more convenient to use a normalized time correlation function (TCF). For the

discrete processes the TCF has its usual form ( t = mτ, N − 1 > m > 1 )

a(t) =

1
(N − m)σ(0)σ(t)

N −1−m

Xj=0

δx(T + jτ )δx(T + (j + mτ )),

where σ(0) and σ(t) is the variances of the initial (t = 0) and ﬁnal (at moment t) states of a systems, correspondingly.
The properties of the TCF a(t) are determined by the conditions of normalization and attenuation of correlations

lim
t→0

a(t) = 1, lim
t→∞

a(t) = 0.

If we take into account the non-stationarity and discreetness of complex systems for real processes, then the kinetic
equation for the TCF a(t) has the form of a closed set of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations of the non-Markov type
[31, 32, 33, 34]:

It is easy to see, that in Eq. (10) we deal with the time correlation of new orthogonal dynamic variable ˆL21A0
k(0).
Eq. (8) represents the ﬁrst equation in the chain of ﬁnite-diﬀerence kinetic equations with memory for the discrete
TCF a(t). It is easy to see that the memory function M1(t) takes into account the statistical memory about previous
states of the system. By using the procedure of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization [31] we receive the recurrent formula,
in which the older dynamic variable Wn = Wn(t) is connected to the younger one in the following way:

W0 = A0

k(0), W1 = {i ˆL − λ1}W0, . . . Wn = {i ˆL − λn−1}Wn−1 + Λn−1Wn−2, n > 1.

(11)

Introducing the corresponding projection operators we come to the following chain of connected non-Markov ﬁnite-
diﬀerence kinetic equations (t = mτ )

Here λn+1 is an eigen-value of the Liouville’s quasioperator and the relaxation parameters Λn+1 are determined as
follows

λn = i

< Wn ˆLWn >
< |Wn|2 >

, Λn = −

< Wn−1(i ˆL − λn+1)Wn >
< |Wn−1|2 >

.

Eqs. (8)-(12) are written down in view of that in the present work we analyze short time series. In this case it is

possible to not take into account the nonstationarity functions [33].

III. EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND DATA PROCESSING

In our study we use the records of electric signals data in legs muscles at human’s walking from the data base of
physionet website [39]. The ﬁrst group of the data describe the dynamics of children’s gait, aged from 3 to 10, (I

type), the second represents teenagers, 11 to 14, (II type), the third includes young people, 21 to 29, (III type), the
fourth contains the data on elderly persons, 71 to 77, (IV type), the ﬁfth characterizes Parkinson patients (V type)
[39]. The obtained data were dealt with the help of the above introduced technique. The set of the three memory
functions was calculated for each sequence of the data. The power spectra for each of these functions are obtained by
the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Also we will show the phase portraits in plane projections of the multidimensional
space for the dynamic orthogonal variables. For a more detail diagnostics of the system we will consider the frequency
dependence of the three ﬁrst points of the statistical spectrum of the non-Markovity parameter. In this study we will
use the frequency dependence of the non-Markovity parameter [31]-[34]

Here i = 1, 2.. and µi(ω) is a power spectrum of ith level.

For a more detailed analysis of data we present a multiplicative power (MP)on the ﬁxed frequency. This parameter

allows to reveal the precise quantitative distinctions in the power spectra of diﬀerent groups of the data

M =

where τ is discretization time. In this work the multiplicative power (MP) is introduced only to account for µi(ωspec),
where i=0, ... 3. Further it is possible to use senior memory functions to reveal a more precise distinction between

the investigated groups of the data.

IV. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

6

In this section the quantitative and comparative analysis of the chaotic dynamics of healthy people’s gait and the
gait of Parkinson patients will be carried out on the basis of the theory presented in section III. In Figs. 1-5 the time
series of the initial signals, the phase portraits of the dynamic variables, the power spectra of the TCF, the junior
memory functions and the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst three points of non-Markov parameter are considered.

The time series of the electric signals in leg muscles for all the ﬁve groups of the data are given in Fig. 1. The
analysis of the ﬁrst four orthogonal variables W0 (Figs.1a), W1 (Figs.1b), W2 (Figs.1c), W3 (Figs.1d) shows that the
brightest ﬂuctuations of the dynamic variables can be observed in case of Parkinson patients. The time series of the

dynamic variables for the data of III type (young people) have the best organization. Pronounced ﬂuctuations are
observed in the development of the signals for all the groups of probationers. In Fig. 2 the phase portraits of the
four ﬁrst dynamic variables in six plane projections for the healthy young man (III type) are given. In this ﬁgure the
symmetry of the phase clouds about the center of coordinates is appreciable. In all phase portraits one can see the
centralized nucleus and a few separate points scattered on the perimeter. The interval of the dispersal is 0.1 τ . The
completely diﬀerent picture is observed in case of the Parkinson patients (V type) (see, Fig. 3).

In Fig. 3 the symmetry of the phase portraits about the center of coordinates is visible. But here another important
feature namely the stratiﬁcation of phase clouds can be observed. The stratiﬁcation of the phase cloud results in the

uniform distribution of all the points all over the space and the disappearance the well-deﬁned nucleus. The interval of
the dispersion of the points increases up to 0.175 τ . Such stratiﬁcation is typical only of the data of V type. This kind
of phase clouds corresponds to the condition of Parkinson’s disease. The analysis of the data of other groups shows
that even the small stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds demonstrates the failure of the system and makes it possible to
predict Parkinson’s disease at early stages.

It is necessary to note that certain stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds similar to the data of V type is observed for 5
- 6.5 year old children and for 12 - 13 year old teenagers. This phenomenon is related to physiological changes of this
age. Infringements of the gait dynamics are caused by age changes of the brain regulator functions. Thus it is diﬃcult
to predict predisposition to parkinsonism at these age periods. In Fig. 4 the power spectra of the TCF µ0(ω) and
the three younger memory functions of µi(ω), i = 1, 2, 3 for all ﬁve groups of the data are given. The low frequency
spectra are submitted for a more detailed analysis of the data on a double-log scale. The spectra for the data of I-IV
types have a speciﬁc fractal dependence. The brightest fractality is observed for the initial TCF µ0(ω).

The frequency spectra of Parkinson patients (V type) considerably diﬀer from the spectra of the healthy people.
In this case the fractal dependence disappears. Sharp breaks of the linear sites of spectra on all frequencies are
characteristic for all memory functions. Sharp spectral peaks are especially appreciable on low frequencies. The
similar peaks are also observed in case of probationers of the I type, the phenomenon is caused by insuﬃciently
”mature” coordination and regulation of the locomotor activity. It is necessary to note, that the distribution of power

spectra of the memory functions on high frequencies for all the groups of the data is almost identical. It is easy to
see condensation of spectral lines as well as spectral noise. It means that the most trustworthy information can be
obtained only on low frequencies.

There are power spectra of the µi(ωspec), i = 0...3, where ωspec = 10−2f.u., 1f.u. = 2π/τ , and of the multiplicative
power on the ﬁxed frequency (MP) for the 5 types of probationers in Table 1. The spectrum of µ0(ωspec) presents the
greatest interest. The value of this parameter (in units of τ 2) has the order from 101 for children and teenagers (I-II
type) up to 102 for young and elderly persons (III-IV type). For patients (V type) this parameter is minimal and has
the order of the unit. The increase of this parameter means extension of long-range memory and long-range order in
the system. The values of other parameters µi(ωspec), i = 1, 2, 3 for the data of all the types are of order of unit and
are almost identical.

By analogy with the frequency spectrum of TCF MP parameter (in units of τ 2) has the order from 102 for children

7

and teenagers (I-II type) up to 103 for young and elderly persons (III-IV type). For Parkinson patients (V type) this
parameter has the minimal value of the order about 101. The numerical value MP means the presence of long-range
memory and order in a healthy system. It is necessary to notice, when the top index in a product of µi(ωspec)(i > 3)
increases then the values of the MP in Eq. (14) for diﬀerent groups get greater distinctions.

By analogy it is possible to use the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst three points of the statistical non-Markov
spectrum εi(ω), where i = 1, 2, 3 (ﬁg. 5) to diagnose the diseases of the motor system. The fractality is most
appreciable in the behavior of the ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) for I-IV types of probationers. The spectra of the third point
non-Markov parameter ε3(ω) for all probationers are almost identical and take the shape of a straight line ε3(ω) = 1
with small ﬂuctuations. It means strong non-Markovity. In frequency spectrum ε1(ω) the condensation of the spectral
lines in the region of 0 ¡ ω ¡ 0.2 f.u. for I-IV types and their absence for V type is appreciable. For the probationer
of I-III types the spectral discharges close to the characteristic frequency of 0.2 f.u. is observed.

The spectral lines for all points of the εi(ω) for V type of probationers take a shape of straight line εi(ω) =1 (where
i=1,2,3) with a feebly marked bursts. For all the groups of the data the behavior of the spectra of non-Markov
parameter εi(ω) means the possibility to describe the dynamics of human gait with the help of the non-Markovity
process with feebly marked splashes of Markovity on low frequencies.

In Table 2 the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst three points of the non-Markovity parameters εi(ω), i=1,2,3 where
ω = 0 is given. The results for the ε1(0) present a great interest. The comparative analysis of the this parameter allows
to deﬁne the evolution of the dynamics of human gait. The value of this parameter for the healthy people varies from
4 up to 7 (according to the age group). The probationers of type V have the order of a unit. The decrease or increase
of this parameter concerning the average value of 5.5 for the healthy people means the degree of predisposition to the
diseases of human motor system. The values of others parameters ε2(0) and ε3(0) change within an interval of 1 to
2. This means long-range order and the statistical memory of the system.

In Table 3 the quantitative data of some kinetic and relaxation parameters λ1, λ2, λ3, Λ1 and Λ2 are given. We

notice, that all the parameters for V type accept the least values.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this work the dynamics of human gait is considered as the random non-Markov process. The statistical theory
of discrete non-Markov processes for real objects and live systems is the best way to investigate this phenomenon.
This theory [31, 32, 33, 34] allows to deﬁne essential distinctions between the parameters for healthy people and the
people with infringements of locomotor activity. On the basis of processing of the experimental data of the electric
signals in legs muscles the time series of the dynamic variables Wi(t) were obtained and memory functions as well as
the ﬁrst three points of non-Markov parameter were calculated. For the analysis of the time functions we used the
power spectra received by the FFT. The numerical parameters, given in Tables I-III, demonstrate essential distinctions
between the ﬁve groups of the data (I-V).

It is possible to make the following conclusions based on the long-range memory conception. There are, at least,
the two age periods (5-6.5 years and 12-13 years), when it is diﬃcult to diagnose predisposition to the infringement of
the locomotor activity. These periods are connected with the age of physiological changes in young human organism.
Within other age periods the predisposition to the infringement of the locomotor activity is possible to be diagnosed.
The diseases of such sort are closely connected to general infringements of human CNS. This is very important for

preventive diagnostics.

The organization of gait is diﬀerent for various age groups of the healthy probationers (I-IV groups) and for the
Parkinson patients (V group). Random movement dynamics is characteristic of the healthy probationers. Organization
and rigidity in gait dynamics is inherent in the Parkinson patients.

The received results can present practical value in diﬀerent studies of other diseases of human motor system (for

example, Huntington’s disease) and in diagnosing various infringements of human CNS.

In this paper we have clearly demonstrated that the set of relaxation, kinetic and spectral parameters as well as
the characteristics of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes are valuable for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.
Since the similar situation is typical for the majority of the phenomena in live systems our conclusions is of profound

importance for live sciences.

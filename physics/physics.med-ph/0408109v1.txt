Abstract. Monte Carlo simulation is an essential tool in emission tomography
that can assist in the design of new medical imaging devices, the optimization of
acquisition protocols, and the development or assessment of image reconstruction
algorithms and correction techniques. GATE, the Geant4 Application for
Tomographic Emission, encapsulates the Geant4 libraries to achieve a modular,
versatile, scripted simulation toolkit adapted to the ﬁeld of nuclear medicine.
In particular, GATE allows the description of time-dependent phenomena such
as source or detector movement, and source decay kinetics. This feature makes
it possible to simulate time curves under realistic acquisition conditions and to
test dynamic reconstruction algorithms. This paper gives a detailed description
of the design and development of GATE by the OpenGATE collaboration,
whose continuing objective is to improve, document, and validate GATE by
simulating commercially available imaging systems for PET and SPECT. Large
eﬀort is also invested in the ability and the ﬂexibility to model novel detection
systems or systems still under design. A public release of GATE licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License can be downloaded at the address
http://www-lphe.epﬂ.ch/GATE/. Two benchmarks developed for PET and
SPECT to test the installation of GATE and to serve as a tutorial for the
users are presented. Extensive validation of the GATE simulation platform has
been started, comparing simulations and measurements on commercially available
acquisition systems. References to those results are listed. The future prospects
toward the gridiﬁcation of GATE and its extension to other domains such as
dosimetry are also discussed.

1. Introduction

Emission tomography is becoming increasingly important in modern medicine for
both diagnostic and treatment monitoring, with a demand for higher imaging quality,
accuracy, and speed. Recently enhanced by the wider availability of powerful computer
clusters, Monte Carlo simulations have become an essential tool for current and future
emission tomography development. Examples of research areas beneﬁting from these
developments are the design of new medical imaging devices, the optimization of
acquisition protocols, and the development and assessment of image reconstruction
algorithms and correction techniques.

Currently there are numerous Monte Carlo simulation packages for either PET
(Positron Emission Tomography) or SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computer
Tomography), each with diﬀerent advantages, disadvantages, and levels of reliability
(Buvat and Castiglioni 2002). Accurate and versatile general-purpose simulation
packages such as Geant3 (Brun et al 1987), EGS4 (Bielajew et al 1994), MCNP
(Briesmeister 1993), and most recently Geant4 (Agnostelli et al 2003) are available.
These packages include well-validated physics models, geometry modeling tools, and
eﬃcient visualization utilities. However, it is quite diﬃcult to tailor these packages
to PET and SPECT. On the other hand, the dedicated Monte Carlo codes developed
for PET and SPECT suﬀer from a variety of drawbacks and limitations in terms of
validation, accuracy and support (Buvat and Castiglioni 2002). While an adaptation
of EGS4 to radiation therapy applications exists (Rogers et al 1995, Kawrakov and
Rogers 2003), there are no dedicated PET or SPECT Monte Carlo programs that are
detailed and ﬂexible enough for realistic simulations of emission tomography detector
geometries. SimSET (Harrison et al 1993), one of the most powerful dedicated codes
enabling PET and SPECT simulations, enables a precise and eﬃcient modelling
of physics phenomena and basic detector designs (e.g. ring detectors and planar
detectors), but it has limitations with respect to the range of detector geometries that
can be modeled. For example, a detector ring can not be subdivided into individual
crystals and the gaps between the crystals and the grouping of crystals into blocks
cannot be modeled. In addition, neither SimSET, nor any other publicly available
codes account for time explicitly, which limits their use for modeling time dependent
processes such as tracer kinetics or bed motion.

Clearly, a Monte Carlo code capable of accomodating complex scanner geometry
and imaging conﬁgurations in a user-friendly way, while retaining the comprehensive
physics modeling abilities of the general purpose codes is needed. Furthermore, the
need is to have a platform that can model decay kinetics, deadtime, and movement,
while beneﬁting from the same versatility and support as that of the general-purpose
simulation codes. Object-oriented technology appeared to be the best choice to ensure
high modularity and re-usability for a PET and SPECT simulation tool. Therefore,
we selected the simulation toolkit developed in C++ by the Geant4 collaboration
(Agnostelli et al 2003), and decided to foster long-term support and maintenance
by sharing code development among many research groups forming the OpenGATE
collaboration.

This paper presents a detailed description of the design and development of a
Monte Carlo tool by the OpenGATE collaboration which satisﬁes the requirements
mentioned above.
It was launched at ﬁrst (Strul 2001, Strul 2001b) as an aid in
the design of the ClearPET prototype scanners being developed by the Crystal Clear
collaboration (Ziemons et al 2003). GATE, the Geant4 Application for Tomographic

Emission (Santin et al 2003, Strul et al 2003, Assi´e et al 2004), incorporates the
Geant4 libraries in a modular, versatile, and scripted simulation toolkit that is
speciﬁcally adapted to the ﬁeld of nuclear medicine. A public release of GATE licensed
under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL n.d.) can be downloaded at the
address http://www-lphe.epﬂ.ch/GATE/.

2. GATE basics

GATE was designed with several objectives in mind.
First, the use of the
GATE software should not require any knowledge of C++. End-users from the
nuclear medicine community should be able to use GATE without worrying about
the programming details. Second, as many nuclear medicine diagnostic techniques
share similar concepts, GATE software components should be general enough to be
reused from one context to another. Last, GATE should be modular, and thus be able
to evolve as new applications are envisioned.

2.1. Architecture

The requirements discussed above are met using a layered architecture. The core
of GATE, developed in C++, deﬁnes the main tools and features of GATE. The
application layer is an extensible set of C++ classes based on the GATE core. On top
of the application layer is the user layer, where end-users can simulate experiments
using an extended version of the Geant4 scripting language.

Figure 1. Sketch of the layered architecture of GATE.

The GATE developer layer consists of the core layer and the application layer. It
is built from the various classes that provide the most general features of GATE. These
classes deﬁne which tools are available, what developers can do, and how they can do
it. The core layer includes some base classes that are common or even mandatory in all
Geant4-based simulations, such as those involved in the construction of the geometry,
the interaction physics, the event generation, and the visualization management. In
addition, the core layer includes classes that are speciﬁc to GATE simulations, such as
the GATE virtual clock for time management. Thus, the core layer deﬁnes the basic
mechanisms available in GATE for geometry deﬁnition, time management, source
deﬁnition, detector electronics modelling, and data output.

The application layer is composed of classes derived from the base classes of the
core layer to model speciﬁc objects or processes. For example, the core layer deﬁnes
the base class for volumes, and the application layer comprises all the derived classes

GATE: a simulation toolkit for PET and SPECT

for modeling speciﬁc volumes, including boxes, spheres, cylinders, and trapezoids.
Similarly, the application layer includes all the speciﬁc movement models derived from
the movement base class, including translations, rotations, orbits, and oscillations.
Thus, the range of features available in GATE can increase as new application classes
are developed, while the general structure remains unaﬀected.

In the user layer, Geant4 provides mechanisms for running simulations both
interactively or batch-wise using scripts. An important principle of GATE is that
each class must provide dedicated extensions to the command interpreter class, so
that the functionality provided by the class is available through script commands.
The end-users of GATE therefore do not have to perform any C++ coding. The
complete set-up of a nuclear medicine experiment can be easily deﬁned using the
script language, as shown in Figure 2.

repeater command produces an 8 × 8 cubic array of crystals from a single crystal
with a crystal picth of 4.5 mm in both directions. A ring repeater places the block
at 125.0 mm from the origin on the X-axis and replicates it eighteen times about
a cylinder around the Z-axis.

2.2. Systems

When deﬁning the geometry for a tomograph, speciﬁc guidelines with respect to
the geometrical hierarchy of the tomograph components must be followed, so that

GATE: a simulation toolkit for PET and SPECT

the Geant4 particles interaction histories, called hits, occuring in the detector, can
be processed to realistically mimic detector output. Most PET scanners are built
following comparable concepts: one or more rings, each ring consisting of several
scintillator blocks, each block being subdivided in crystal pixels. For SPECT, similar
concepts exist: a gamma camera with a continuous or pixelated crystal, and a
collimator. Most of these geometrical concepts are common to many diﬀerent imaging
systems. To facilitate the hierarchical description of a tomograph, predeﬁned global
systems are used. A system is deﬁned as a family of geometries compatible with
one or several data output formats. The main property of a system is that its
geometry description is supported by speciﬁc list-mode or histogrammed (sinogram
or projection) data output formats. Currently there are ﬁve systems available in
two for block detector geometries and one

for continuous pixellated geometries
and a generic system appropriate to model
novel tomographic paradigms. This latter system is completely open and provides
only basic building blocks for the deﬁnition of a tomographic experiment.

2.3. Management of time and movements

One of the distinctive features of GATE is the management of time-dependent
phenomena (Santin et al 2003, Strul et al 2003). The synchronization of the source
kinetics with the movement of the geometry thus allows for the simulation of realistic
acquisition conditions including patient movement, respiratory and cardiac motions,
scanner rotation, or changes in activity distribution over time. Dealing with time
in GATE includes: (a) deﬁning the movements associated with the physical volumes
that describe the detector and phantom; (b) describing the radioactive sources; and
(c) specifying the start and stop times of the acquisition (which are equivalent to the
start and stop times in a real experiment).

The Geant4 geometry architecture requires the geometry to be static during
a simulation. However, the typical duration of a single event is very short when
compared to movements in the geometry model or bio-kinetics. Movements are
synchronized with the evolution of the source activities by subdividing the acquisition
time frames (typically of the order of minutes or hours) into smaller time steps. At
the beginning of each time step, the geometry is updated according to the requested
movements. During each time step, the geometry is held at rest and the simulation
of the particle transport proceeds. Within the time steps, the source is allowed to
decay so that the number of events decreases exponentially from one time step to
the next, and within the time steps themselves. The proper timing of the simulated
event sequence is a key feature for modeling time-dependent processes such as count
rates, random coincidences, event pile-up, and detector deadtime (Simon et al 2004).
Between time steps, the position and the orientation of a subset of daughter volumes
can be changed to mimic a movement such as a rotation or a translation. These
displacements are parametrized by their velocity. It is the responsibility of the user to
set the time step duration short enough to produce smooth changes. Combinations of
translations and rotations allow the simulation of complex acquisition trajectories of
the detectors such as parameterized eccentric rotations.

Geant4 does not allow the movement of sources. Therefore, in GATE, an emission
volume is deﬁned so that it encompasses the actual source’s volume throughout its
range of displacement. To enable movement of the activity distribution, an additional
volume is deﬁned to conﬁne the emission within the intersection of the emission and

GATE: a simulation toolkit for PET and SPECT

7

the conﬁnement volumes. This conﬁnement volume deﬁnes the shape and size of the
actual source and moves within the emission volume.

3. Physics

3.1. Radioactive sources

A source in GATE is deﬁned by its particle type (e.g. radionuclide, gamma, positrons,
etc.), position (volume), direction (solid angle), energy (spectrum), and activity. The
lifetime of a radioactive source is usually obtained from the Geant4 database, but it
can also be set by the user to approximate a decay source through the emission of its
decay products (e.g. positrons or gammas).

The activity determines the decay rate for a given source during the simulated
acquisition time. Radioactive decay of radionuclides with secondary particle emission
is performed by the Geant4 Radioactive Decay Module (RDM), which has been
modiﬁed so that GATE source manager maintains control over the deﬁnition of decay
time. Continuous event time ﬂow is obtained by using a virtual clock that deﬁnes
an absolute time t used to initialize the Geant4 internal tracking time. Random
time intervals δt between events that occur at time t are sampled from a exponential
distribution:

p(δt) = A(t) exp(

A(t) δt)

−

(1)

−

where A(t) = A0 exp((t
t0) / τ ) is the source activity at time t, A0 is the user
deﬁned source activity at time t0 and τ the lifetime. When the resulting decay time
exceeds the end of the current time step, the run is terminated and a new one is started,
allowing for the synchronization of the sources with the geometry movements. Multiple
sources can be deﬁned with independent properties. For each event, a proposed time
interval is sampled for each source according to Eq. 1, and the shortest one is chosen
for the primary generation. The overall behavior of this mechanism is such that,
at all times, the relative importance of each source is proportional to its activity,
while the overall time interval sampling is determined by the total activity of all
sources. Voxelized phantom or patient data can be used as sources to reproduce
realistic acquisitions: emission data are converted into activity levels, and GATE can
read in voxelized attenuation map and converts the gray scale into material deﬁnitions
using an analogous translator.

3.2. Positron emission

GATE includes 2 modules dedicated to PET (Jan 2002). The ﬁrst uses the von
Neumann algorithm (von Neumann 1951) to randomly generate the positron energy
according to the measured β+ spectra. This method greatly increases the speed of the
simulation by bypassing the decay of radionuclides process used by Geant4. The β+
spectra of 3 commonly used radionuclides (11C,15O, and 18F) have been parametrized
in GATE according to the Landolt-B¨ornstein tables (Behrens and J¨anecke 1969).

The second module deals with the acollinearity of the two annihilation photons,
which is not accounted for in Geant4 . In GATE, acollinearity is modelled using a
0.58o full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian blur. This width corresponds
to experimental values measured in water (Iwata et al 1997).

3.3. Interaction modelling with standard energy and low energy packages

A material database ﬁle contains all material parameters required by Geant4 to
calculate the interaction cross-sections and is easily modiﬁed by the user. In contrast
to Geant4, GATE only uses natural isotopic abundances. The fact that these cannot be
modiﬁed by the user has little bearing on GATE applications since isotopic abundances
are unimportant in low to mid-energy photon and charged particle interactions.
The electromagnetic interactions used in GATE are derived from Geant4 . The
electromagnetic physics package manages electrons, positrons, γ-rays, X-rays, optical
photons, muons, hadrons, and nuclei. As in Geant4, GATE can use two diﬀerent
packages to simulate electromagnetic processes: the standard energy package, and the
low energy package. In the standard energy package, photoelectric eﬀect and Compton
scatter can be simulated at energies above 10 keV. Under 100 keV however, relative
errors on the cross-sections are higher than 10% and can raise up above 50% (Jan 2002
and Lazaro 2003). The low energy package models photon and electron interactions
down to 250 eV and includes Rayleigh scattering. For biomedical applications, it
provides more accurate models for the electromagnetic interactions. However, this
comes at the price of increased computing time.

3.4. Secondary production cuts

GATE inherits the Geant4 capability to set thresholds for the production of secondary
electrons, X-rays and delta-rays (Agnostelli et al 2003). In biomedical applications,
eliminating the secondary particles whose initial energy is below the production
threshold increases the computing eﬃciency.

Because low energy processes generate more secondary particles than standard
energy processes, cuts aﬀect simulation speed more strongly when applied with the
low energy package. Turning oﬀ the production of electrons, X-rays, and delta-rays
by setting high thresholds may result in a substantial increase in computing speed for
a typical simulation of a PET scanner. In many cases, the accuracy of the simulation
at the level of single or coincidence photon counting is preserved.

4. Digitization

Digitization is the process of simulating the electronics response of a detector within a
scanner. This involves the conversion of the charged particle and photon interactions
into energy bins, detection positions, and coincidences. To do this, portions of the
scanner geometry are designated as sensitive detectors, which record interactions
within these regions. The digitizer chain then processes these recorded interactions
and produces counts and coincidences. The sensitive detectors and digitizer chain are
described below.

4.1. Sensitive detectors

Sensitive detectors are used to store information about particle interactions (hereafter
referred to as hits) within volumes. GATE only stores hits for those volumes that have
a sensitive detector attached. Two types of sensitive detectors are deﬁned in GATE:
the crystal sensitive detector (crystalSD) is used to generate hits from interactions
that occur inside the detector portions of the scanner (Figure 3). The phantom

no hit information is stored.

sensitive detector (phantomSD) is used to detect and count the Compton and Rayleigh
interactions occurring within the scanner’s ﬁeld-of-view (FOV).

4.2. Digitizer chain

The digitizer chain mimics a realistic detection process by building the physical
observables from the hits. The observables of each detected event are energy, position,
and time of the interaction. The digitizer consists of a chain of processing modules
that takes a list of hits from the sensitive detectors and transforms them into pulses
referred to as singles. The key elements of this chain are now brieﬂy described.

4.2.1. Hit adder A particle entering a sensitive detector can generate multiple hits,
as shown in Figure 3. For instance, a gamma ray interacting within a scintillation
crystal can generate hits corresponding to several Compton scattering events and a
photoelectric absorption. The hit adder sums the deposited energy of these hits within
a sensitive detector to yield a pulse. The position of the pulse is calculated from the
energy-weighted centroid of the hit positions, and the time of the pulse is set to that
of the ﬁrst hit within the volume. If a particle interacts in several sensitive detectors
the hit adder will generate a list of pulses, one for each sensitive detector.

4.2.2. Pulse reader With the exception of one-to-one readout schemes, scanners often
have a readout segmentation diﬀerent from the detector segmentation. To simulate
this, a pulse reader module adds the pulses together within a user-deﬁned group of
sensitive detectors. This yields a pulse containing the total energy deposited within
the group of sensitive detectors. The position of this pulse is set to that of the pulse
from the adder that has the largest energy (winner-takes-all paradigm).

GATE: a simulation toolkit for PET and SPECT

4.2.3. User modules Following the hit adder and the pulse reader, which regroup
the hits into pulses and then sum pulses, the remaining modules of the digitizer chain
transform these pulses into the physical observables of the scanner (i.e. singles). These
modules are discussed below.

Energy resolution: This module applies a Gaussian blur to the energy of the pulse,

E, with an FWHM of R

E. The FWHM energy resolution, R, is given by:

×

R =

where R0 is the user deﬁned FWHM energy resolution at a given energy, E0.

involved with light collection and detection in a spectrometric chain as:
υǫ

υE = υN +

υM

where υE, υN , υη, υǫ, and υM are the relative variances on E, on the number
of scintillation photons N , on the light collection eﬃciency η, on the quantum
eﬃciency of the photo-detector ǫ, and on the gain of the photo-detector M . Both
the light collection eﬃciency and the quantum eﬃciency are binomial processes
with probabilities of η and ǫ, respectively. If the scintillation process is assumed
to follow a Poisson law with a mean equal to ¯N = E
LY , where LY is the light
yield of the scintillator, then relative variance on E is given by:

×

In the case of a photomultiplier, υM is approximately 0.1 and the FWHM energy
resolution is estimated using the equation:

where Ri is the intrinsic resolution of the scintillator (Kuntner et al 2002).
Energy window: Upper and lower energy thresholds can be set for several energy
windows by using multiple processor chains. These thresholds are applied using
either a step or sigmoid function.

Spatial resolution: For SPECT, spatial resolution is modeled using a Gaussian blur
of the position. For PET, interaction position is calculated by the pulse reader
which simulates the intrinsic spatial resolution of the detector. More elaborate
models can be derived for continuous crystal detector PET systems (Staelens et
al 2004). These models are currently under development.

Time resolution: Simulation of time jitter can be obtained using a Gaussian blur

of the pulse time.

Deadtime: Both paralyzable and non-paralyzable deadtimes can be modeled
explicitely on an event-by-event basis. While these models represent the idealized
behavior, they correctly predict the theoretical
lifetimes for both types of
deadtimes (Simon et al 2004).

Coincidence: At the end of a digitizer chain a coincidence sort can be added to
ﬁnd pairs of singles that are in coincidence. Pairs of singles can be considered

GATE: a simulation toolkit for PET and SPECT

11

coincidences whenever the time interval between the singles is less than a user-
deﬁned coincidence window. Each single is stored with its corresponding event
If the event numbers of the singles associated in a coincidence are

diﬀerent, this is a random coincidence. A similar ﬂag exists for Compton
scattered events. The Compton scatter ﬂag can be used to diﬀerentiate true from
scattered coincidence pairs that have identical event ﬂags. Multiple coincidences
corresponding to more than 2 singles within the same coincidence window are
discarded.

4.3. DigiGATE

In GATE standard operation mode, primary particles are generated by a source
manager and then propagated through the attenuating geometry before generating
hits in the sensitive detectors, which are then processed by the digitizer chain. While
this operating mode is suitable for many purposes, it is ineﬃcient for the optimization
of the digitizer chain parameters. This is best done by comparing the results from
diﬀerent sets of digitizer parameters using the same series of hits. To perform this
speciﬁc task, GATE oﬀers an operating mode named DigiGATE. In this mode, hits
are read from a data ﬁle generated by GATE and fed directly into the digitizer
chain. The same command scripts are used for both the hit generation simulation
and DigiGATE simulations. Thus, all conditions are kept identical in the simulations
including time-dependence.

5. Simulation benchmarks

Two benchmarks, one for PET and one for SPECT, are included in the
GATE distribution. These benchmarks check the integrity of the installation or
upgrade, and also allow for the comparison of CPU performance on diﬀerent computing
In addition, they provide examples of how to use the main features of
platforms.
GATE to simulate PET or SPECT experiments. Furthermore, they serve as examples
on how to analyze output. Each benchmark consists of macros to run the simulation,
analyze simulation output, and generate ﬁgures. In addition, a set of baseline ﬁgures
are included for a comparison between the user’s results with those from a correct run.

5.1. PET benchmark

The PET benchmark (Figure 4) simulates a whole-body scanner that does not
correspond to any existing system. Rather, it serves as a simple system that contains
the majority of GATE features. It consists of eight detector heads arranged within
a 88 cm diameter by 40 cm axial length octagonal cylinder. Each head is made
5 array of dual-layer LSO-BGO
of 400 detector blocks and each block is a 5
crystals. The heads are equipped with partial septa that rotate in a step-and-shoot
mode. The phantom in this benchmark is a 70 cm long water cylinder with one 18F
(half-life = 109.8 min) and one 15O (half-life = 2.03 min) line source each with an
activity of 100 kBq. The simulated acquisition is 4 min in duration, which represents
approximately two 15O half-lives. The source activities are set such that the PET
benchmark will run in about 12 CPU hours on a 1 GHz processor. The acquisition is
divided into two 2 min frames; after the ﬁrst frame, the gantry rotates by 22.5 deg.
Only coincident events are recorded, using a coincidence time window of 120 ns. This

large window is used in order to record a large number of random coincidences. The
lower and upper energy thresholds are set to 350 and 650 keV, respectively.

The standard electromagnetic package of Geant4 is used in this benchmark. Only
the Rayleigh interactions are modeled using the low energy package. To speed up the
simulation, X-rays and secondary electrons are not tracked.

107 decays occur during the simulated acquisition and around
Approximately 3.7
105 coincidences are recorded and written in a ROOT ﬁle (Brun and Rademakers
7.0
1997). Based on the ROOT output, several ﬁgures and plots are calculated using
ROOT to conﬁrm the correct execution of the simulation. The benchmark results are
characterized by: (1) the total number of generated events and detected coincidences;
(2) their spatial and time distributions; (3) the fractions of random and scattered
coincidences; and (4) the average acollinearity between the two annihilation gammas.
The PET benchmark has been run on 12 diﬀerent system conﬁgurations. Two
operating systems were tested : Linux and Mac OS (versions 10.2.6 and 10.3). The
Linux distributions were RedHat (versions 9.0, 8.0 and 7.3) and SuSE (version 8.1).
The source code compilation was performed with either gcc 2.95 or 3.2. The computing
time for the PET benchmark averaged around 12 and 6 hours for 1.0 GHz and 3 GHz
processors, respectively.

PET physical variables characterizing the simulation results are shown in Table 1
with their mean value and standard deviation obtained from the run of the PET
benchmark on the 12 system conﬁgurations, using a diﬀerent initial seed on each
system for the generation of random numbers. The results in Table 1 and, in particular,
the relative standard deviations show that the main physical simulation variables are
stable within less than 1%. It is strongly recommended that the user validates a new
or updated GATE installation using this table.

5.2. SPECT benchmark

The SPECT benchmark (Figure 5) simulates a SPECT acquisition with a moving
source. The simulated 4-head gamma camera does not correspond to any real system.
This benchmark involves a cylindrical phantom (5 cm in diameter and 20 cm long)
ﬁlled with water with an inner cylinder (2 cm in diameter, 5 cm long) ﬁlled with
30 kBq of 99mTc. The phantom lies on a table (0.6 cm thick, 8 cm wide, and 34 cm
long). During the simulated acquisition, the table and phantom translate together at
0.04 cm/s. Conﬁnement is used to keep the source distribution synchronized with the
phantom movement. All 4 heads of the gamma camera are identical, consisting of a
parallel hole lead collimator (hole diameter: 0.3 cm, collimator thickness: 3 cm, and
septa thickness: 0.6 mm), a 1 cm thick NaI crystal, a 2.5 cm thick back-compartment
in Perspex, and a 2 cm thick lead shielding. The simulated acquisition consists of
64 projections (16 projections per head), acquired along a circular orbit with a 7 cm
radius of rotation and a speed of 0.15 deg/s. Sixteen runs of 37.5 s each are performed
to simulate the 16 positions of the 4 gamma camera heads.

The low energy electromagnetic processes package is used to model the physics.
Rayleigh, photoelectric, and Compton interactions are turned on while the gamma
conversion interactions are turned oﬀ. To speed up the simulation, the X-ray
production cut is set at 20 keV and secondary electrons are not tracked. Compton
events occurring in the phantom, collimator, back-compartment, shielding and table
are recorded. A Gaussian energy blur is applied to all events detected in the crystal,
using an energy resolution of 10% at 140 keV. The limited spatial resolution of the
photomultipliers and associated electronics is modeled using a Gaussian blur with a
standard deviation of 2 mm. Only photons detected with an energy between 20 and
190 keV are stored.

The benchmark results are characterized by: (1) the number of simulated events
and of detected counts; (2) the percentage of primary and scattered events with respect
to all events detected in the 20-190 keV energy window (here scattered events are
considered a function of the compartment in which the last scattered event occurred
i.e. phantom, collimator, table, crystal, or back-compartment); (3) the mean and
standard deviation of the number of detected counts per projection; (4) the percentage
of scattered events as a function of the scattering order (1st for single scatter, 2nd for
double scatter, and so on).

The SPECT benchmark has run on 11 system conﬁgurations. Two operating
systems have been tested: Linux (RedHat versions 9.0, 8.0, 7.3, 7.1, SuSE versions 9.0
and 8.1, and Fedora Core 1) and Mac OS (version 10.2.8). The mean and standard

Table 2. Similar to the PET benchmark results, this table shows that the results
produced by GATE are very stable. Table 2 should be used to validate any new
installation or update of GATE. The time needed to run the benchmark ranged from
about 3 hours (2.8 GHz Pentium, 2 Gb RAM) to about 11 hours (1 GHz Pentium,
2.3 Gb RAM).

6. Validation of GATE

The validation of Monte Carlo simulated data against real data obtained with
PET and SPECT cameras is essential to assess the accuracy of GATE and the
OpenGATE collaboration is largely involved into the validation of GATE. Tables 3 and
4 list commercial systems which have been or are currently being considered for PET
and SPECT validations. These tables summarize the ﬁgures of merit (FOM) used
for assessing the consistency between simulated and real data, as well as the major
validation results and associated references. For details regarding these validation
studies, the reader is highly encouraged to refer to the appropriate references. Overall,
these studies illustrate the ﬂexibility and reliability of GATE for accurately modelling
various detector designs. The modelling of the Millennium VG (GE MS) is also in
progress.

7. Work in progress and future developments

7.1. Speed-up techniques

Compared to simpler dedicated codes like SimSET (Harrison et al 1993), the versatility
of GATE comes at the expense of relatively long computation times. To compensate
for this, variance reduction tools are currently being developed for GATE. Another
approach to improve the computing performance of GATE is to distribute the
simulations on multiple architectures. This is referred to as the gridiﬁcation of GATE,
and consists of subdividing simulations on geographically distributed processors in a
Grid environment by parallelizing the random number generator. GATE simulations
use a very long period pseudo-random number generator developed from the algorithm
of F. James (James 1990, Marsaglia and Zaman 1987). This random number generator
can be subdivided into 900 million diﬀerent non-overlapping sub-sequences, each
containing approximately 1030 numbers. These sub-sequences provide convenient
starting points throughout the main sequence. Parallel simulations are produced
by using the sub-sequences as independent streams by a sequence splitting method
(Traore and Hill 2001). To demonstrate the potential beneﬁts of gridiﬁcation, a
simulation was performed. Table 6 gives the total computing time in minutes of a
simulation running on a single 1.5 GHz Pentium IV and the same simulation split
between 10, 20, 50 and 100 processors on the European DataGrid testbed. In this
experiment, the testbed consisted of 200 dual-processors with a mix of 750 MHz and
1 GHz Pentium III, and 1.4 GHz Pentium IV processors. Gridiﬁcation using 20 jobs
decreased the computing time by a factor of 8 when compared to using a single Pentium
IV 1.5 GHz processor. This example emphasizes the fact that computing time is not
proportional to the number of jobs running in parallel, due in part to the launch time
of the jobs, the modelling of the geometry of the simulation (which is independent
of random number generation), and the time spent in queuing jobs. This study also
proved that the results obtained via the Grid were equivalent to those generated on a
single machine. In the future, each Unix platform on the DataGrid will be installed
with GATE, allowing the use of more than 500 processors for a simulation. The
development of a convenient tool to split, launch, and retrieve GATE simulations on
a Grid environment using a web interface is currently under development.

7.2. Extension of GATE to other domains

Besides its application to classical emission tomography, GATE is potentially appro-
priate to simulate in-line tomography in hadrontherapy.
Indeed, GATE possesses
the ability to model the distribution of β+ emitters along the beam path. In prin-
ciple, this distribution can be obtained from knowledge of the nuclear cross-sections

of the reactions between heavy ions and target nuclei. This distribution can then be
accurately reproduced in GATE using a voxelized source, composed of the diﬀerent
emitters (15O, 11C and 10C).

Currently, Monte Carlo simulations are believed to be the most accurate method
for dose calculation in radiotherapy and brachytherapy. A comparison of the
computational codes in radiation dosimetry is under way (Berger et al n.d.). In this
context, the anisotropy function F (r, θ) (Nath et al 1995) of a 192Ir brachytherapy
source in water has been studied. As illustrated in Figure 6, anisotropy functions in
water have been calculated using Geant3 (Brun et al 1987), MCNP4C (Briesmeister
1993), MCPT (Williamson 1998), and GATE at a radial distance of 2 cm. GATE was
in agreement with all other codes. The relative deviation concerning anisotropy
functions between MCPT and GATE simulations is less than 3%. This indicates that
GATE has potential to perform dose calculations in brachytherapy. The challenge
for GATE is to provide detailed descriptions of local doses delivered by radiotherapy
It is envisioned that this can be done with voxelized
or brachytherapy treatment.
phantoms in future GATE simulations.

8. Conclusion

Based on Geant4, GATE is a versatile and adaptable platform for simulating PET
and SPECT experiments. GATE is appropriate for simulating conventional scanners
and novel detection devices, and does not require any knowledge of C++. The
OpenGATE collaboration, representing a large number of research groups from around
the world, has publicly released this simulation toolkit after two years of software
development and validation. The source code is available for download, which will
enable users to make modiﬁcations to suit their particular needs. Documentation is
available and user support is provided through a very active mailing list.

The future of GATE is closely related to the future of Monte Carlo simulations in
nuclear medicine. Because Monte Carlo simulations are playing an increasing role in
the optimization of detector design and in the assessment of acquisition and processing
protocols, we hope that GATE will answer many of these needs. In addition, the eﬀorts
of the OpenGATE collaboration should ensure that GATE will continue to evolve
to become a comprehensive simulation tool at the service of the nuclear medicine
community.

Simulations of isotope-production irradiations of targets in the radiation environ-
ments of ﬁssion reactors or particle accelerators require the evaluation of proton
and/or neutron particle ﬂuxes within the target and the integration of these with
appropriate cross-section data. In ﬁssion reactors, proton ﬂuxes are typically con-
sidered negligible and the approach reduces to neutron reactions at energies below
the upper extents of the ﬁssion spectrum at which neutrons are born — 10 to 15
MeV. In particle accelerator target simulations, the secondary neutron ﬂux can
provide considerable production and/or collateral target activation. Where tar-
get and product nuclides are separated in Z and A, the relative contributions of
neutron and proton reactions may not be apparent. Through decades of eﬀort
in nuclear data development and simulations of reactor neutronics and accelera-
tor transmutation, a collection of reaction data is continuing to evolve with the
potential of direct applications to the production of medical isotopes. At Los
Alamos the CINDER’90 code and library have been developed for nuclide inven-
tory calculations using neutron-reaction (En≤20 MeV) and/or decay data for 3400
nuclides; coupled with the LAHET Code System (LCS), irradiations in neutron
and proton environments below a few GeV are tractable; additional work with the
European Activation File, the HMS-ALICE code and the reaction models of MC-
NPX (CEM95, BERTINI, or ISABEL with or without preequilibrium, evaporation
and ﬁssion) have been used to produce evaluated reaction data for neutrons and
protons to 1.7 GeV. At the Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory, eﬀorts have fo-
cused on production of medical isotopes and the identiﬁcation of available neutron
reaction data from results of integral measurements.

1 Introduction

Medical radioisotope production is receiving increased attention due to the
many advances in nuclear medicine. In addition to further development in
diagnostic nuclear medicine, pioneering work is being done in therapeutic ap-
plications of radioisotopes. For example, radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies
are being used to treat leukemia and lymphoma, brachytherapy is being used

to treat prostate cancer, radioactive stents are being used to prevent resteno-
sis (reclogging of arteries) following angioplasty treatment of coronary heart
disease, and radioisotopes are being used to palliate the excruciating bone
pain associated with metastatic cancer.

Continued success in developing cures for cancer and ultimately in treat-
ing a large number of cancer patients is adversely impacted by this lack of
knowledge of certain neutron capture cross sections for medically important
radioisotopes. Without this data, medical radioisotope production cannot be
optimized. Optimization is not only critical for economic reasons, but also for
applications requiring the production of very high speciﬁc activity radioiso-
topes. In many cases, trial and mixed success is “de rigueur” for producing
certain radioisotopes of medical signiﬁcance.

2 Reactor-Spectrum Data Needs

As an example, the thermal and resonance integral cross sections are known for
186W and 187W , but not for 188W. Thus, optimal production of the medically
important radioisotope 188W may not be realized since calculations related
to the design of 186W targets, their placements in a reactor and irradiation
times cannot accurately be performed.

The design for a reactor focused on isotope production needs to consider
the neutron cross sections of the medical radioisotopes to be produced so
that proper neutronic conditions can be achieved for optimal radioisotope
production. Neutron cross section information is needed to design targets
(and hopefully a reactor) for the optimal production of medical radioisotopes.
Production of medical radioisotopes in ﬁssion reactor systems must be
optimized with respect to several diﬀerent parameters: position, target com-
position, density, conﬁguration, etc. Research is required to determine the
needed cross sections. Knowledge of these cross sections will beneﬁt several
practical applications and will also provide important modern data informa-
tion for many isotopes previously unavailable.

The main objective of an initiative to address the cross section deﬁciencies
is to access the cross sections that are of the greatest projected need. Table 1
identiﬁes several medical radioisotopes that harbor deﬁciencies in cross section
knowledge required for eﬃcient, high speciﬁc activity production. In order to
demonstrate how the lack of knowledge of the cross section impacts production
results, calculations were made for six important medical isotope products.
Table 2 shows these results comparing values with known and unity cross
sections.

3 Medium-Energy Data Evaluations

In the radiation environment of a proton accelerator target, neutron and pro-
ton reactions may signiﬁcantly contribute to the production of the desired
radionuclide. Medium-energy protons may each produce a few tens of neu-
trons in a high-Z target, each having a signiﬁcant range and contribution to
particle ﬂux. The complexities resulting from the myriad of possible reaction
paths, along with spatially varying ﬂux magnitudes and spectra, require the
evaluation of pertinent cross sections and ﬂuxes. These are evaluated in se-
quential calculations with the LAHET Code System LCS1 — the combination
of LAHET and MCNP2, or their subsequent combination in MCNPX3 — with
the CINDER’90 nuclide inventory code;4,5 in this sequence, cross sections for
reactions of protons and medium-energy neutrons are calculated with on-line
nuclear models and evaluated lower-energy neutron reaction cross section are
contained in the CINDER’90 library. This state-of-the-art sequence is used
eﬀectively in the analysis of medium-energy designs but requires a signiﬁcant
investment of CPU time.

Nuclear models have also been utilized with limited available measured
cross section data to form evaluations for a growing number of target nuclides.
Neutron and proton cross sections from threshold to 1.7 GeV have been eval-
uated for the stable isotopes of O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, S, Cl, Ar, K, Zn, Ga,
Ge, As, Zr, Nb, Mo, Xe, Cs, Ba, La, and Hg — or about 30% of the naturally-
occuring stable nuclides. These evaluations have used available measured data
from the LANL T-2 compilation,6 the evaluations of the EAF97 library7 for
neutrons below 20 MeV, and calculations with HMS-ALICE,8 CEM95,9 and
the BERTINI and ISABEL models of LAHET. Samples of the data and evalu-
ations for two of nearly 700 reactions evaluated to date are shown in Figure 1.
Complete results are shown in Ref. 10.

4 Conclusions

The status of simulation methods and data available for the description of
isotope production is fair and improving, but many additional cross section
measurements and evaluations are needed. Consequently, further research in
obtaining better cross section information will have positive beneﬁts in the
ﬁeld of medical science.

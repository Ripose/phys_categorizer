Abstract. A liquid isooctane (C8H18) ﬁlled ionization linear array for radiotherapy
quality assurance has been designed, built and tested. The detector consists of 128
pixels, each of them with an area of 1.7 mm × 1.7 mm and a gap of 0.5 mm. The
small pixel size makes the detector ideal for high gradient beam proﬁles like those
present in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and radiosurgery. As read-
out electronics we use the X-Ray Data Acquisition System (XDAS) with the Xchip
developed by the CCLRC.

Studies concerning the collection eﬃciency dependence on the polarization voltage
and on the dose rate have been made in order to optimize the device operation. In the
ﬁrst tests we have studied dose rate and energy dependences, and signal reproducibility.
Dose rate dependence was found lower than 2.5 % up to 5 Gy min−1, and energy
dependence lower than 2.1 % up to 20 cm depth in solid water. Output factors
and penumbras for several rectangular ﬁelds have been measured with the linear
array and were compared with the results obtained with a 0.125 cm3 air ionization
chamber and radiographic ﬁlm, respectively. Finally, we have acquired proﬁles for an
IMRT ﬁeld and for a virtual wedge. These proﬁles have also been compared with
radiographic ﬁlm measurements. All the comparisons show a good correspondence.
Signal reproducibility was within a 2% during the test period (around three months).
The device has proved its capability to verify on-line therapy beams with good spatial
resolution and signal to noise ratio.

1. Introduction

Nowadays the veriﬁcation of radiotherapy treatments in most of the hospitals is
performed through air or solid state ionization chambers. These chambers are
mechanically displaced to obtain beam proﬁles. IMRT techniques require detectors able
to verify and to monitor the clinical beams with high spatial resolution and fast response.
Furthermore, the dose rate at any point must be integrated over the entire exposure,
limiting the use of typical ionization chambers.
IMRT veriﬁcation with radiographic
ﬁlms (RGFs), radio-chromic ﬁlms (RCFs) or electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs)
provide a high spatial resolution. However, RGFs need a chemical processing and over-
respond to low energy scattered photons (Sykes et al 1999, Martens et al 2002), RCFs
present response non-uniformity (Niroomand-Rad et al 1998) and calibration of EPIDs
is a diﬃcult task, which complicates high precision dosimetry with all of these devices.
Segmented anode ionization chambers, like those presented in Martens et al (2001),
Belletti et al (2001) and Eberle et al (2003), and diode arrays (Jursinic and Nelms
2003) are an alternative. Although faster veriﬁcation procedures are possible with these
devices, none of them achieve a millimeter range spatial resolution.

In this paper we present the design, the operation principles and the ﬁrst tests of
a 128 pixel linear array whose aim is to obtain a proﬁle in a single beam shot with
enough resolution to make mechanical displacement unnecessary. Each pixel has an
area of 1.7 mm × 1.7 mm. The active medium is a 0.5 mm thick isooctane layer,
which is encapsulated between two printed circuit boards. We used a standard liquid
isooctane from Merk‡, with a purity ≥ 99.8%. No further puriﬁcation, in order to obtain
an ultra-pure liquid, has been made. Non polar liquids are becoming and alternative
to air and solid state semiconductors in radiotherapy detectors due to their tissue
equivalent behavior, their sensitivity and their small directional dependence. Liquid
ﬁlled ionization chambers are currently used in radiotherapy both for dosimetry, as
shown by Wickman and Nystr¨om (1992) and Wickman et al (1998), and portal imaging
as in the device of van Herk and Meertens (1988). One of the most commonly used
liquids is isooctane (2,2,4 trimethylpentane). This non-polar liquid has a quite constant
stopping power ratio to water in a very wide energy spectrum (less than 3% variation
from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV) and also its intrinsic mass density allows to achieve a spatial
resolution in the millimeter range for therapy beams.

2. Detector description

2.1. Detector design

The linear array has been constructed using two printed circuit boards (PCB) that
surround a 0.5 mm thick isooctane layer. The isooctane gap is provided by a PEEK§
spacer. The chamber walls were fabricated using FR4 ﬁber glass epoxy. The upstream

wall has a 0.8 mm thickness and contains the high voltage plane. The downstream one
is a four layer PCB with a 3 mm thickness. The top layer contains the Cu+Ni+Au
anode segmented in 128 pixels. Each electrode has an area of 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm and is
surrounded by a guard electrode biased to +2 V. The pitch is 1.7 mm, and so the linear
array consists of 128 cells of 1.7 mm × 1.7 mm × 0.5 mm giving a total active length of
21.6 cm. The internal layers contain metallic strips that carry out the ionizing charge
produced in the liquid to one of the device sides, where the detector is connected to
the read-out electronics. In the bottom layer was deposited a 35 µm thick Cu clad to
shield the strips from external noise. The high voltage electrode dimensions (250 mm
× 15 mm) are larger than the sensitive area in order to guarantee a high electric ﬁeld
uniformity in the active volume. Figure 1 shows a scheme of the detector layout, and
ﬁgure 2 shows the detector cross section. The total dimensions of the assembled device
are 350 mm × 70 mm × 4.5 mm.

2.2. Read-out electronic system

The X-ray Data Acquisition System (XDAS) has been used as read-out electronic. This
system is provided by the company Electron Tubes Ltd., and it is based on the Xchip
developed by the CCLRC. It consists of a modular system in which each board has 128
read-out channels, and up to 63 boards can be serially connected, giving a maximum
of 8064 readout channels. The main characteristics of the XDAS system are showed
in table 1. For this application we only use one board (128 channels). The response
of each read-out channel has been studied using a Thevenin current source. The mean
sensitivity of the channels is 4272±6 ADC counts per pC. The relative non-uniformity
in the response of the channels (ﬁgure 3) is lower than 0.6 %.

The XDAS system together with the DC power supplies and a high voltage
generator were mounted into a metallic box (the electro-meters station) to protect them
from external noise and also to make a manageable device. This portable unit is placed
close to the detector and outside of the direct beam. It is connected to the detector
through a 3 meter double shielded cable, and to a PC standard serial and parallel ports
for digital control and read-out. Figure 4 shows a photo of the assembled device.

3. Principles of operation

3.1. Initial recombination

When ionizing radiation interacts with a medium ionizes electron-ion pairs along its
track. Electrons released from molecules thermalize at a distance r, where the electron
and the positive ion are still bounded by the Coulomb interaction. This causes the
recombination of a fraction of the primary ionization pairs produced, which is called
initial recombination. These eﬀects are much more relevant in liquids than in gases due
to the fact that mass density of liquid hydrocarbons is almost three orders of magnitude
higher than density of gases at normal conditions, and then r is much smaller. The
amount of electron-ion pairs escaping initial recombination per 100 eV of absorbed
energy is denominated the free ion yield and is denoted as Gﬁ. The initial recombination,
and thus the Gﬁ, depends on the liquid properties, on its temperature, T , an on the
external electric ﬁeld, E, (Onsager 1938), but does not on the dose rate. For low electric
ﬁeld values (E ∼ 103 V mm−1) the Gﬁ rises approximately linear with the electric ﬁeld:

Gﬁ ≃ G0

ﬁ [1 + aE]

(1)

The constant a must be measured for a correct absolute dosimetry, but is well
approximated by a ≃ 1/E0 (Mozumder 1974, Pardo et al 2004), where E0 =
8πǫrǫ0(κT )2/e3 is the called Onsager ﬁeld. Here ǫr and ǫ0 are the relative dielectric
constant of the liquid and the dielectric constant of the vacuum respectively, κ is the
Boltzmann constant and e is the electron charge.

3.2. Volume recombination and ion collection eﬃciency

The electrons that have escaped from initial recombination ﬂow due to drift and
diﬀusion, and this made possible the interaction between ions from diﬀerent tracks,
which causes the volume recombination. Volume recombination depends on the liquid
properties, on the electric ﬁeld, on the dose rate and also on the form in which the dose
is delivered (i.e. pulsed or continuous radiation).

Actual clinical linear accelerators delivered the dose in high ionization pulses of a
few µs duration and several ms period. The beam dose rate is modulated varying the
pulse period.

If the pulse period, p, is higher than the charge carriers drift time in the liquid, i.e.

when

p ≥

h2
V kmin

the collection eﬃciency will not depend on the period (i.e. on the dose rate). In equation
(2) kmin denotes the lower mobility. In this case we can apply the theory of Boag (1950).
This theory assumes the negative charge is carried by ions and also neglects space charge
eﬀects and recombination during the pulse. The theory has been experimentally tested
by several authors (see for example Johansson et al 1997), and within it the collection
eﬃciency is given by,

where r is the amount of charge released by the radiation in the liquid and escaping

the polarization voltage, k+ and k− are the mobilities of positive and negative charge
carriers and α is the volume recombination constant, which for a low permittivity non-
polar liquid can be expressed as (Debye 1942),

We use a numerical simulation to calculate the collection eﬃciency of the detector
irradiated by a pulsed beam using the parameters of table 2. We considered the pulse
period of a Siemens Primus accelerator placed in the Hospital Clinico Universitario de
Santiago, which is related to the monitor unit rate as



where p is expressed in seconds and ˙M is the monitor unit rate expressed in MU min−1.
Figure 5 shows the computed detector collection eﬃciencies. In ﬁgure 5(a) the dose
rate is modulated varying the source-detector distance (SDD). The pulse period verify
equation (2) and then the Boag theory can be applied. There is a good correspondence
between the simulation, the Boag theory and the experimental points (for a 1000 V
operation voltage). In ﬁgure 5(b) the distance is constant and the dose rate is modulated
changing the accelerator monitor unit rate (up to 300 (500) MU min−1 for the 6 (15)
MV beam). We can see that in the upper part of the curves there is not dependence on
the dose rate. This is due to in this region the pulse period is higher than the charge
carriers drift time. Due to this fact, the collection eﬃciency does not go to 1 when the
dose rate goes to 0, because the zero dose rate limit is achieved taking p → ∞. In the
constant part of the curves the results obtained with the simulation are very close to
those computed from the Boag theory. For example, for the 15 MV beam, with a 1000
V polarization voltage, the simulated collection eﬃciency at low dose rates is ≃ 98.6
%, very close to the experimentally measured (≃ 98.7 %, although due to accelerator
dose rate oscillations the experimental results have important uncertainties as we can
see in ﬁgure 5(b)) and to the computed from the Boag theory (≃ 98.7%). For the 6
MV beam with the same voltage the simulated value is ≃ 99.2 % and the the computed
from the Boag theory is ≃ 99.3 %. Only in the case of overlapping of charges ionized
by diﬀerent pulses will the collection eﬃciency depend on the dose rate. In this case
the Boag theory cannot be applied. In ﬁgure 5(b) we can see a quite good agreement
between the experimental points, for the 15 MV beam and with a 1000 V detector
polarization voltage, and the simulation.

From ﬁgure 5 we can conclude that the recombination is higher when there is not
pulse overlapping and the dose rate is modulated changing the SSD. The maximum
detector response non-linearity depends on the charge collection eﬃciency variation
between low and high dose rates. Thus, a higher non-linearity is expected when the
dose rate is modulated in this way.

as 1 cGy at the maximum depth (1.6 cm for 6 MV and 3 cm for 15 MV) in a water
phantom for a 10 cm × 10 cm ﬁeld and SSD=100 cm. Measurements were performed
in a home-made solid water phantom. The detector operation voltage was 1000 V and
the XDAS integration time was 10 ms. Unless mentioned otherwise, the SSD was 100
cm.

Comparative measurements of OFs and energy dependence have been made with a
0.125 cm3 air ionization chamber (PTW, Freiburg, Germany, type 31010). Penumbras
and proﬁles measurements were compared with RGFs measurements. In some cases we
used a 0.015 cm3 PinPoint chamber (PTW, Freiburg, Germany, type 31006) which has
a 2 mm diameter.

4.2. Pixel response calibration

To study the pixel response homogeneity the detector was inserted in the phantom at a
2 cm depth and irradiated with 10 cm × 10 cm 6 MV photon shots, each one delivering
50 MU at a 100 MU min−1 rate. Between each shot the detector was displaced 1.7 mm
with a micro-metric linear stage in order to compare the read-out signal of each pixel in

A 128 pixel liquid linear array for radiotherapy quality assurance

the center of the ﬁeld. The maximum relative deviation in the response was ∼ 6 %. The
non-homogeneity is due to diﬀerent response of each XDAS read-out channel (studied
in subsection 2.2.) and to small inhomogeneities in the gap and the pixel area. These
eﬀects have been corrected in all the following measurements.

4.3. Read-out signal linearity with the dose rate

Figure 6 shows the read-out signal in the central pixel of the device plotted against the
dose rate, when the detector was irradiated by a 10 cm × 10 cm 15 MV photon beam.
The detector is placed in the phantom at a 4 cm depth. In the ﬁrst case, ﬁgure 6(a),
the monitor unit rate was 100 MU min−1 to avoid the superposition of charge carriers
ionized by diﬀerent pulses, and the dose rate was modiﬁed changing the SSD from 130
cm to 60 cm. In the second case, ﬁgure 6(b), the SSD was 100 cm and the dose rate
was modiﬁed varying the accelerator MU rate from 50 MU min−1 to 500 MU min−1 in
50 MU min−1 steps.

It is common to ﬁt this relationship to the empirical expression of Fowler and Attix

(1966)

S = k ˙D∆

(5)

where S is the read-out signal, k is a parameter for the detector sensitivity and
∆ a parameter related to the non-linearity of the detector response. We obtain
∆ = 0.993 ± 0.007 in the ﬁrst case, and ∆ = 0.984 ± 0.007 in the second case, which
implies a small non-linearity in both cases. The linear ﬁt of the lower dose rate points
shows 1.5 % deviation from linearity in the ﬁrst case (at 2.9 Gy min−1) and 2.1 % in
the second (at 5 Gy min−1).

4.4. Photon beams proﬁles

Figure 7 shows a proﬁle of a 15 MV 5 cm × 5 cm at 5 cm depth in solid water, measured
with our linear array, with the PinPoint chamber (displaced with the linear stage in 2
mm steps) and with RGF. All the proﬁles show a good correspondence.

To study possible systematic deviations in the penumbras measured with the linear
array, several 90 %-10 % and 80 %-20 % penumbras of photon beams were measured.
The studied ﬁelds were 5 cm × 5 cm at 3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm for 15 MV, and
at 1.5 cm, 3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm for 6 MV in the solid water phantom. The
MU rate was 100 MU min−1 in all cases. For each conﬁguration penumbras from linear
array proﬁles were determined through quadratic interpolation, and the average of the
left and the right penumbras was considered. The results were compared with RGF
measurements. We use RGF despite its energy dependence because this eﬀects does
not aﬀect too much the penumbra measurements, at least at moderate depths and ﬁeld
sizes (Martens et al 2002), and it provides a high spatial resolution. Diﬀerences between
measurements of both detectors are plotted in ﬁgure 8. We can see that penumbras
measured with the linear array are broader, in general, than those measured with RGF.

Output factors (OFs) are deﬁned as the ratio of the dose at a given depth for a given ﬁeld
size to the dose at the same depth for the reference ﬁeld size. OFs for several rectangular
ﬁelds were measured with the central pixel of the linear array and compared with the
OFs measured with the reference detector. The length of the ﬁeld was 10 cm and the

width was varied between 10 cm and 1 cm in 1 cm steps. A 5 cm × 5 cm was taken
as reference ﬁeld. The accelerator MU rate was 100 MU min−1. The depth was 5 cm
for 6 MV and 10 cm for 15 MV in the solid water phantom. As reference detector we
used the 0.125 cm3 chamber, except for the narrowest ﬁeld where we used the 0.015 cm3
chamber due to its smaller sensitive volume.

Figure 9 shows the OFs measured with the linear array, the reference detector, and
their relative deviation. The linear array seems to over-respond to narrow ﬁelds both for
6 MV and 15 MV (up to 2.9 % for the 1 cm width 15 MV ﬁeld). However for the smaller
ﬁelds the OFs uncertainty is large due to the positioning uncertainty and the diﬀerence
between the sensitive volume of both detectors. For wider ﬁelds the linear array presents
an under-response (around 0.5 % and 0.1 % for 6 MV and 15 MV respectively). This
behavior has been observed and studied in a similar detector by Martens et al (2001)
who found that is related with the eﬀect of the electrode metalization.

4.6. Energy dependence and eﬀect of the ﬁeld size.

To study the dependence on the energy spectrum of the incident radiation and the
inﬂuence of the irradiated area on the read-out signal, measurements were performed
for 6 MV and 15 MV at several depths and for several ﬁeld dimensions. The results
were compared with the data obtained with the 0.125 cm3 chamber. Figure 10 shows
the ratio of the linear array measurements to those of the reference detector. The ratio
was normalized to unit for a 5 cm × 5 cm ﬁeld at 3 cm both for 6 MV and 15 MV.
The relative uncertainties of the normalized data plotted in the ﬁgure are around 0.5
%. From this ﬁgure it is clear that the relative signal decreases when the ﬁeld size

Figure 9. OFs measured with the linear array (×) and with the reference detector
(◦) for 6 MV (a) and 15 MV (c). OFs relative deviations for 6 MV (b) and 15 MV (d)

increases as was expected from the OFs measurements.
In addition the linear array
underrresponds when the depth is increased. This under-response is up to 2.7 % for
6MV and up to 2.5 % for 15 MV, and again can be related with the metallization of the
electrodes (Martens et al 2001).

4.7. Measurement of an IMRT and virtual wedge proﬁles

The detector can be used for the veriﬁcation of virtual wedges. A proﬁle of a 450 virtual
wedge for a 15 MV 10 cm × 10 cm, delivering a total of 200 MU, has been acquired
with the linear array and RGF. The results are compared in ﬁgure 11, with a maximum
diﬀerence of 3% and an average diﬀerence less than 1 %.

Also a proﬁle of an IMRT ﬁeld which consists of four segments, each one delivering
50 MU, was acquired. Each segment delivered 50 MU. The linear array and RGF results
are compared in ﬁgure 12. The maximum diﬀerence is 3 % while the average diﬀerence
is again less than 1 %.

4.8. Signal reproducibility

The signal reproducibility was studied along the test period (around three months). All
equivalent measurements were within a 2 %. An important fraction of this deviation
is due to temperature dependence, which has not been studied. Liquid-ﬁlled devices
relative read-out signal dependence on temperature is around 10−3 per degree due to
the temperature inﬂuence on initial recombination (Mozumder 1974, Wickman et al
1998).

5. Conclusions

The response of each linear array pixel is very linear with the dose rate (2.1 % deviation
at 5 Gy min−1). A correction factor has to be applied to each pixel due to the low
inhomogeneity in the XDAS response, and to small inhomogeneities in the gap and the
pixel area. OFs measurements deviates less than 1 % from those measured with the
reference detector for ﬁeld widths from 2 cm to 10 cm (2 cm to 10 cm) for 6 MV (15
MV). For the narrower ﬁelds the deviation is less than to 3 %, but for this narrow ﬁelds
the positioning uncertainty is high, and the diﬀerence between the active volume of a
linear array pixel and the reference detector can aﬀect the OFs measurements. The
energy dependence is lower than 2 % (for depths up to 20 cm and ﬁeld sizes from 5 cm
× 5 cm to 20 cm × 20 cm). Despite this dependence is not very large, it has to be taken
into account when using the detector at high depth.

The detector has measured with accuracy several beam proﬁles and penumbras, and
also IMRT and virtual wedge treatments. The small pixel size of the device combined
with the fast and sensible XDAS read-out system allow a faster veriﬁcation of these ﬁelds

with a very good spatial resolution (even in regions of high dose gradient) and signal
to noise ratio, making mechanical displacement unnecessary and showing its utility for
high-precision relative dose measurements.

In addition, the detector can be used for absolute dose measurements. The Gﬁ
and its dependence with the electric ﬁeld have been studied together with the charge
losses due to volume recombination. Considering these eﬀects, the absolute dose can be
obtained from the read-out signal. Studies concerning the temperature dependence, the
inﬂuence of the detector walls in the absolute dose deposited in the medium, the dose
calibration and also the long term stability of the device will be the scope of further
work.

Abstract.

Depth distributions of positron-emitting nuclei

in PMMA phantoms are
calculated within a Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT) based on
the GEANT4 toolkit (version 8.0). The calculated total production rates of 11C,
10C and 15O nuclei are compared with the corresponding results of the FLUKA
code and with experimental data. The distributions of e+ annihilation points
are obtained by simulating radioactive decay of unstable nuclei and transporting
positrons in surrounding medium. A ﬁnite spatial resolution of the Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) is taken into account in a simpliﬁed way. Depth
distributions of β+-activity as seen by a PET scanner are calculated and compared
to available data for PMMA phantoms. The calculated β+-activity proﬁles are in
good agreement with PET data for proton and 12C beams at energies suitable for
particle therapy. The MCHIT capabilities to calculate β+-activity distributions
in tissue-like materials of diﬀerent chemical composition are demonstrated.

1. Introduction

Beams of charged particles, protons and light nuclei, are proved to be very suitable
for the radiation therapy of deep-seated compact tumors (Castro et al 2004). Their
selective and strong impact on a tumor is possible due to a maximum energy deposition
at the end of their range in matter (the Bragg peak). According to the statistical
data of Particle Therapy Cooperative Group (PTCOG 2006) over 48000 patients were
treated worldwide with proton or ion beams by July 2005. Light nuclei, e.g. carbon
ions, have an additional advantage compared to protons due to their increased relative
biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) (Kraft 2000). Treatment schemes using the carbon-ion
irradiation demonstrated good clinical results (Schulz-Ertner et al 2004, Tsujii et al
2004, Kanai et al 2006).

In most cases so far (see PTCOG 2006) the dedicated therapy facilities use either
proton or heavy-ion beams. Since 2001, the Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Center (HIBMC)
operates as the ﬁrst facility in the world which makes possible to use two types of
beams, protons and carbon-ions, in a single location (Hishikawa et al 2004, Mayahara
et al 2005).

Several new facilities are planned or under construction in Europe: HICAT in
Germany (Haberer et al 2004, Heeg et al 2004), CNAO in Italy (Amaldi 2004),
ETOILE in France (Bajard et al 2004) and MedAustron in Austria (Griesmayer and
Auberger, 2004). These particle therapy centers will also have proton and carbon-ion
beams on their sites. Each of the two types of beams or their combination will be
available for patient treatment.

Particle therapy has to be based on thorough treatment planning,

including
optimization between positive and negative eﬀects of the beam. A required dose of
radiation has to be delivered to a tumor while sparing surrounding healthy tissues and
organs at risk. The optimization of doses requires a reliable method for calculating the
beam energy deposition in highly heterogeneous human tissues. Up to now, mostly
deterministic methods have been used by diﬀerent groups for dose calculations in
hadron therapy, see e.g. Hong et al (1996), Kr¨amer et al (2000), J¨akel et al (2001).
However, a Monte Carlo simulation of particle transport in human body can be used
nowadays as an alternative method for dose calculations. Increasing power of modern
computers makes this method less restrictive in terms of the CPU time (Rogers 2006).
In view of the prospective wide use of both proton and carbon-ion therapy in
several medical centers worldwide, one can think of employing common computational
tools for proton and ion therapy based on the Monte Carlo approach. We believe that
the GEANT4 toolkit (Agostinelli et al 2003) is well suited for this purpose. This
toolkit was created by an international collaboration of physicists and programmers
for basic research in nuclear and particle physics. This is an open-source project based
on modern techniques of programming and visualization. It is capable of simulating
a wide range of physical processes in extended media, which makes it useful for
applications in medical physics.

The GEANT4 toolkit is written in C++ and consist of an extended library of
classes and methods which provide the basic functions for simulations (GEANT4-
Documents 2006), e.g. handling setup geometry, tracking primary and secondary
particles, calculation of their energy loss and energy deposition in matter, run
management, visualization and user interface. On this basis, a speciﬁc application
can be developed for each particular task. The results on validation of the GEANT4
toolkit for proton therapy (Jiang and Paganetti 2004) and for therapy with electrons
and photons (Carrier et al 2004, Larsson et al 2005) have been presented recently.
A GEANT4-based application for tomographic emission (GATE) was developed by
the Open-GATE collaboration (Jan et al 2004) and successfully used in Monte Carlo
simulations of commercial PET scanners (Schmidtlein et al 2006, Lamare et al 2006).
The GEANT4 toolkit is also used for simulations in brachytherapy (Enger et al 2006,
Perez-Calatayud et al 2006).

In our recent paper (Pshenichnov et al 2005) we have made a ﬁrst attempt to
validate the GEANT4 toolkit of version 7.0 (GEANT4-Webpage 2006) for heavy-ion
therapy simulations. We have developed a GEANT4-based application for Monte
Carlo simulations of Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT). The depth-dose distributions
in tissue-like media, calculated within this model, are in a good agreement with
experimental data. The relative contribution to the total dose due to secondary
neutrons was quantitatively evaluated for proton and ion beams.

In the present work we extend the applicability of the MCHIT model to
calculations of secondary β+-radioactivity induced by proton and heavy-ion beams
in tissue-like media. Currently, the MCHIT application is based on the version 8.0
(with patch 01) of GEANT4 toolkit.

2. Dose and range monitoring in particle therapy by positron emission
tomography

The main advantage of proton and heavy-ion therapy consists in the possibility to
deliver a prescribed dose to a tumor volume while sparing surrounding healthy tissues
and organs at risk. This requires thorough veriﬁcation of the proton and heavy-
ion ranges in patient’s body. Tissue inhomogeneities and local anatomical changes
between irradiation sessions (fractions) of particle therapy may lead to some diﬀerences
between the actual dose delivered to a patient and the prescribed dose.

Two methods for dose veriﬁcation in proton and heavy-ion therapy were proposed.
In the ﬁrst method, the beams of β+-radioactive nuclei 19Ne, T1/2 = 17.22 s, (Tobias
et al 1977), 11C, T1/2 = 20.39 min, (Urakabe et al 2001) or 10C, T1/2 = 19.255 s,
(Iseki et al 2004) are ejected in the patient, ﬁxed in the proper position, just before
the therapeutic treatment with the beams of stable nuclei, 20Ne or 12C, respectively.
However, the practical application of this method is limited by high costs of the
radioactive beams.

More frequently another method is used which utilizes the fact that β+-
radioactive nuclei are produced in fragmentation reactions taking place in tissues
during irradiation with beams of protons or stable nuclei, e.g. 12C. In proton therapy
target fragmentation reactions produce 15O, T1/2 = 122.24 s, among other fragments.
As was early realized (Bennett et al 1975, 1978), this can be used for controlling
the proton beam localization in tissues. Later, a similar auto-activation technique,
but involving 10C and 11C nuclei produced in fragmentation of 12C projectiles, was
proposed for dose monitoring in carbon-ion therapy (Pawelke et al 1996, 1997).

Unstable nuclei 10C, 11C and 15O undergo β+-decay: A(Z, N ) → A(Z − 1, N +
1) + e+ + νe. Due to the three-body kinematics, the energy released in the transition
of a bound proton into a bound neutron is partly carried away by a neutrino, so
that emitted positrons have continuous energy spectrum with the maximum energy
of 1-2 MeV. Such positrons travel a few-millimeter path, in fact 5-10 mm, before they
annihilate on electrons: e+e− → γγ. Since the elastic and inelastic scattering to
large angles are quite probable for such low-energy positrons, their path in tissue is
far from a straight line. The average distance from the point of positron emission
to the point of annihilation is much shorter, ∼ 1 mm. The angle between the
momenta of photons emitted in e+e−-annihilation is close to 1800 since e+ annihilates
practically at rest. The emitted photons can be registered by detectors outside the
patient body. Corresponding reconstruction algorithms make possible to obtain the
spatial distribution of annihilation points, which should be close to the β+-activity
distribution. It is further expected that the spatial distribution of β+-activity induced
by proton and heavy-ion beams is strongly correlated with the corresponding dose
distribution. However, there exists no simple way to express the dose distribution in
terms of the β+-activity distribution.

In practice, the problem is solved in a few steps. First, the β+-activity
distributions are measured in advance in experiments with phantoms for diﬀerent
beam energies and doses. In particular, such measurements have been performed for
proton beams in phantoms made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), C5H8O2 or
lucite (ρ = 1.18 g/cm3) by Oelfke et al (1996) and Parodi et al (2002). The β+-
activity measurements for 12C beams in PMMA were made by Enghardt et al (1992),
and later by Pawelke et al (1997), P¨onisch et al (2004) and Parodi (2004).

Second, the models capable of calculating both the dose and β+-activity

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

4

distributions are validated with these data. For example, a phenomenological model
for the proton transport together with isotope production cross-section data was
used by Oelfke et al (1996) to calculate the dose and β+-activity distributions in
homogeneous media. Parodi and Enghardt (2000), Parodi et al (2002) used a
model based on the FLUKA Monte Carlo code to calculate the β+-activity and
dose distributions for proton and carbon beams in PMMA phantoms. In the present
paper we propose to use the GEANT4 toolkit for calculating the dose and β+-activity
distributions.

Third, the dose applied to a patient in a therapeutic treatment can be veriﬁed via
comparison of the β+-activity distribution in the patient body with the distribution
predicted by the model for the same dose.

3. GEANT4 physics models used in MCHIT

We use the version 8.0 (with patch 01) of the GEANT4 toolkit (GEANT4-Webpage
2006) to build a Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT). Currently this
model is capable of calculating the three-dimensional distributions of dose and β+-
activity in homogeneous media.
In this model a homogeneous tissue-like phantom
is represented by a water cube or by a cube made of PMMA. Calculations can be
also made for phantoms representing bone, liver or muscle tissues. In simulations the
phantom is irradiated by beams of protons or ions with given beam size, emittance,
angular convergence/divergence and energy distribution. The phantom material and
size, as well as all beam parameters can be set via user interface commands individually
for each run.

According to the GEANT4 concept, the set of physical models which are relevant
to a particular simulation problem should be activated by an application programmer
or by a user via a set of commands. A detailed description of physical models included
in GEANT4 is given in the Physics Reference Manual (GEANT4-Documents 2006). In
order to facilitate this selection, the GEANT4 developers recommend to start either
from available examples of previously developed applications, or from the so-called
predeﬁned physics lists.

Here we brieﬂy describe the choice of models and main parameters used in our
calculations. In MCHIT the energy loss of primary and secondary charged particles
due to electromagnetic processes is described via a set of models called ’standard
electromagnetic physics’. It accounts for energy loss and straggling due to interaction
with atomic electrons as well as multiple Coulomb scattering on atomic nuclei.

In each simulation step, the ionization energy loss of a charged particle is
calculated according to the Bethe-Bloch formula. The mean excitation potential of
water molecules was set to 77 eV, i.e. to the value which better describes the set
of available data on depth-dose distributions, both for proton and carbon-ion beams,
in the range of therapeutic energies of 80 - 330 MeV per nucleon of beam particle.
For PMMA, the mean excitation potential was set to 68.5 eV, a default value used in
GEANT4 for this material.

The bremsstrahlung processes for electrons and positrons were activated in the
simulations along with the annihilation process for positrons. For photons, Compton
scattering, the conversion into an electron-position pair and the photoelectric eﬀect
were included.

Two kinds of hadronic interactions are considered in the MCHIT model: (a)
elastic scattering of hadrons on target protons and nuclei, which dominate at low

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

5

projectile energies, and (b) inelastic nuclear reactions induced by fast hadrons and
nuclei (GEANT4-Documents 2006). The model of nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering
is based on parameterization of experimental data in the energy range of 10-1200
MeV. At higher energies the hadron-nucleus elastic scattering is simulated within the
Glauber model (GEANT4-Documents 2005).

Overall probability of hadronic interaction for nucleons and nuclei propagating in
the media depends on the total inelastic cross section for nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-
nucleus collisions. Parameterizations proposed by Wellisch and Axen (1996) that best
ﬁt experimental data were used to describe the total reaction cross sections in nucleon-
nucleus collisions. Systematics by Shen et al (1989) for the total nucleus-nucleus cross
section was used for calculating the probability of nucleus-nucleus collisions.

For inelastic interactions of hadrons two groups of models are available in the
GEANT4 toolkit (Agostinelli et al 2003): (a) the data driven models, which are based
on the parameterizations of measured cross sections for speciﬁc reaction channels, and
(b) the theory driven models, which are based on various theoretical approaches and
implemented as Monte Carlo event generators.

In the MCHIT model the inelastic interaction of low-energy (below 20 MeV)
nucleons,
including radiative neutron capture, were simulated by means of data
driven models. Above 20 MeV the exciton-based precompound model was invoked
(Agostinelli et al 2003).

For hadrons and nuclei with energies above 80A MeV, we employed the binary
cascade model (Folger et al 2004). In this case exited nuclear remnants are created
after the cascade stage of interaction. Therefore, appropriate models for describing
the de-excitation process have to be involved into the simulation. The Weisskopf-
Ewing model (Weisskopf and Ewing 1940) was used for the description of evaporation
of nucleons from nuclei at relatively low excitation energies, below 3 MeV per nucleon.
The Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM) by Bondorf et al (1995) was used
at excitation energies above 3 MeV per nucleon to describe multi-fragment break-up
of highly-excited residual nuclei. The SMM includes as its part the Fermi break-up
model. The latter model describes an explosive decay of highly-excited light nuclei.

The decay of radioactive nuclei was activated to simulate the positron emission via
β+-decay. The tables of radioactive isotopes with the corresponding decay channels
and their probabilities are used in the GEANT4 toolkit to simulate the decay of
unstable nuclei.

4. Production of positron-emitting nuclei by protons and carbon ions

The positron-emitting nuclei 11C, 10C and 15O are created in proton induced reactions
on 12C and 16O of PMMA mostly via (p,n) or (p,2n) reactions. In this case all the
positron-emitting nuclei are fragments of target nuclei which were initially at rest.
Carbon beams produce 11C and 10C mostly via projectile fragmentation. 15O nuclei
are only produced via fragmentation of target 16O nuclei.

The total β+-activity yields were measured for 11C, 10C and 15O by Parodi (2004)
for protons and carbon ions stopped in PMMA phantoms. Since the half-life times
of each of the nuclides are essentially diﬀerent and well-known from the literature,
one can build a mathematical model describing their decay and the total rate of β+-
activity as a function of time. The measured time-dependence of the total β+-activity
was ﬁtted by Parodi (2004) with the yields of 11C, 10C and 15O considered as free

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

6

parameters. The experimental yields of these nuclides obtained in such a way are
listed in tables 1 and 2 along with their uncertainties.

Calculational results of the MCHIT model for 11C, 10C and 15O are listed in
tables 1 and 2 for comparison. According to the MCHIT model, the yields of other
β+-emitting nuclei with T1/2 > 1 min can be neglected. For example, the yields of
13N, 14O, 17F and 18F nuclei together account for less than 5% of the total yield of
β+-emitters produced by ∼ 300A MeV 12C beam in PMMA. The calculations were
performed for the PMMA phantoms of the same size (300 mm × 90 mm × 90 mm)
as used by Parodi (2004) in measurements. The beam intensity in the transverse
directions was assumed to be a Gaussian with the FWHM of 10 mm, while the beam
energy spread was taken with the FWHM of 0.2%.

The results of the FLUKA code obtained by Parodi (2004) are available for several

beam energies too. They are also listed in tables 1 and 2.

produced by 110, 140 and 175 MeV protons in PMMA phantom. Experimental
data and FLUKA calculations by Parodi (2004) are shown for comparison

For protons stopped in PMMA phantoms, the yields of 15O nuclei predicted by
MCHIT show very good agreement both with the experiment and with the FLUKA
results. Since 11C is the most abundant and long-living nuclide, the proper description
of its yield is crucial. As seen from table 1, the agreement between MCHIT results
and the experiment is within ∼ 20% accuracy. As compared with 11C and 15O yields,
the yield of 10C is much lower for proton-induced reactions. The MCHIT results for
10C are in good agreement with the experiment for 110 MeV protons, but not for
140 MeV and 175 MeV protons. In the latter two cases the theory overestimates 10C
yields as compared to the experimental results.

The 11C and 15O nuclides are the most abundant β+-emitters produced by carbon
ions as well as by protons. As follows from table 2, the predictions of the FLUKA
model are less accurate for these nuclides compared to the MCHIT model. We can
state this only for the considered case of 259.5A MeV carbon ions, and for the version

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

7

of the FLUKA model which was used by Parodi (2004). Apparently, more extended
benchmarking of the recent versions of the models against each other and experimental
data is needed to make a justiﬁed conclusion on the quality of the codes.

The yields of 10C nuclei are overestimated by the MCHIT model also for
the 12C beam, in particular, for the most energetic beam of 343.46A MeV. The
FLUKA predictions for 259.5A MeV are closer to the experimental results, but still
overestimate the experimental yield at this energy. Nevertheless, the MCHIT model
is able to describe reasonably well the total yields of the most abundant positron-
emitting nuclei, 11C and 15O, produced by proton and 12C beams in PMMA.

5. Distributions of positron annihilation points

As shown above, the MCHIT model is quite successful in describing the absolute
yields of β+-emitting nuclei. One can now study the spatial distributions of these
nuclei. Such distributions were calculated for 110 MeV protons and 212.12A MeV
12C ions together with the corresponding depth-dose distributions for these beams.
The results are presented in ﬁgure 1. At these energies, protons and carbon ions have
similar ranges in PMMA phantoms. In both cases the Bragg peaks are located at the
depth of ∼ 80 mm. As demonstrated in the previous section, the contribution from
11C and 15O nuclei dominate for both the proton and carbon beams. However, the
shapes and the absolute values of β+-activity distributions are very diﬀerent. Protons
produce 11C, 10C and 15O nuclei in reactions on target carbon and oxygen nuclei.
The cross sections for the 12C(p, pn)11C and 16O(p, pn)15O reactions increase with
decreasing proton energy up to 40-50 MeV and then rapidly fall down. For proton
energies below 20 MeV there is no neutron emission at all. As shown in ﬁgure 1,
11C and 15O dominate and their yields are slowly increasing as the projectile protons
slow down. The production of 10C is signiﬁcantly suppressed because removal of two
neutrons without destroying the remnant is quite improbable. As soon as the proton
energy becomes below neutron emission threshold, the production of β+-activity is
ceased, so that no β+-emitters are created by protons within ∼ 1 cm before the Bragg
peak.

In contrast to the proton irradiation, the maximum of β+-activity produced by
carbon ions is located very close to the Bragg peak and thus clearly marks its position.
The projectile fragments of interest, 11C and 10C, are created in peripheral nucleus-
nucleus collisions, and they have velocities which are on average very close to the
projectile velocity. At given velocity, the ranges of energetic ions in matter R are
proportional to A/Z 2, where A and Z are the ion mass and charge. Therefore, the
average ranges of 11C and 10C are slightly shorter as compared to projectile ions:
R(11C) ∼ 11/12 × R(12C), R(10C) ∼ 10/12 × R(12C). Due to the momentum spread
of 11C and 10C, their stopping points are more widely distributed in depth as compared
to 12C projectiles. However, as a rule, all the projectile fragments are stopped before
the 12C Bragg peak in the depth-dose distribution. As shown in ﬁgure 1, the sharp
fall-oﬀ of the β+-activity distribution clearly indicates the position of the Bragg peak.
This feature is very useful to monitor the ranges of ions in carbon ion therapy.

The distribution of 15O nuclei in 12C induced reactions looks similar to that for
the proton irradiations, as 15O nuclei are also produced in fragmentation of target
16O nuclei. Here, the distribution is quite ﬂat and falls down before the Bragg peak.
Strictly speaking, some of 11C, 10C and 15O nuclei are produced oﬀ the target carbon
and oxygen nuclei by secondary protons created in projectile fragmentation. The

nuclei are shown by the long-dashed, dashed and dotted histograms, respectively,
and their sum is shown by the solid-line histogram. The distribution of actual
e+-annihilation points is shown by the short-dashed histogram.

contribution of such processes is small, but still visible in ﬁgure 1 beyond the Bragg
peak, as secondary protons propagate further.

From the above analysis we see that 11C fragments are the most perspective nuclei
for monitoring the energy deposition in carbon-ion therapy. They have the largest
yield and longest life time (20.39 min) as compared with other β+-emitters. One can
expect that mostly 11C nuclei will survive 10-20 min after irradiation, and therefore
they will determine the distribution of positron annihilation points as measured by
PET scanners.

6. Accounting for a ﬁnite resolution of a PET scanner

As explained in section 2, one can measure the depth distribution of β+-activity via
Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The present study is focused on the ability
of GEANT4 toolkit to describe the production of positron-emitting nuclei rather
then on simulation of various methods of PET measurements. As has been already
demonstrated by Jan et al (2004), Schmidtlein et al (2006) and Lamare et al (2006),
the GEANT4 toolkit is very successful in Monte Carlo simulations of commercial PET

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

scanners.

Here we consider only one question, i.e. how does a ﬁnite resolution of PET
scanners aﬀect our predictions. We take into account the PET spatial resolution in
the following simpliﬁed way. First, the decays of all unstable nuclei were simulated.
Second, all the emitted positrons were traced up to the points of their annihilation in
order to obtain the distribution of e+e−-annihilation points. Results for proton and
carbon ion beams are shown separately in ﬁgures 2 and 3. Third, these distributions
were convoluted with a Gaussian spread function of 8-10 mm FWHM to mimic a
realistic response of a PET imaging system. In particular, similar spatial resolution
was reported by P¨onisch et al (2003) for their positron emission tomograph and 3D
reconstruction algorithm.

As the measured β+-activity distribution depends on the spatial resolution of
the PET scanner, this simple procedure makes possible to compare the calculated β+-
activity proﬁles with those obtained from experiment, as shown in ﬁgures 2 and 3. The

al 1996).

for 62 and 110 MeV protons in PMMA phantoms. In both cases the distributions are

very wide. Once the ﬁnite PET resolution is taken into account via the convolution
of e+ annihilation points with a Gaussian of FWHM = 8 mm, only small changes
in the shape of the distributions are obtained. This leads to better description of
experimental data by Oelfke et al (1996). The agreement with the experiment is
very good for 62 MeV protons. On the other hand, some disagreement with the
experimental data is found for 110 MeV protons, i.e. the measured distribution is more
ﬂat as compared to the calculated one. In ﬁgure 3 the MCHIT results are compared
with the PET data for carbon ions in PMMA phantoms obtained by P¨onisch et al
(2004) for 212.12A MeV, by Parodi (2004) for 259.5A MeV and by Pawelke et al
(1997) for 292.5A MeV. Some monitoring devices were put in front of the PMMA
phantoms during measurements while the MCHIT calculations were performed for
pure PMMA phantoms without any additional elements. Therefore, the experimental
data in ﬁgure 3 were appropriately shifted by 3 - 6 mm to ensure the same position
of the Bragg peak in PMMA as reported by Parodi (2004).

For carbon beams, the consideration of the actual PET resolution is crucial for
proper description of the experimental data. In this case the actual distribution of e+
annihilation points consists of a sharp peak on a ﬂat plateau. In order to investigate the
eﬀect of the PET scanner resolution, the calculated distributions were convoluted with
the Gaussians of FWHM = 8 and 10 mm, resulting in distributions shown in ﬁgure 3.
The calculation with FWHM = 8 mm shows a good agreement with the experimental
data at 212.12A MeV, while at 259.5A MeV a better agreement is achieved for FWHM
= 10 mm. The MCHIT results at 292.5A MeV show a more sharp peak as compared
to experiment by Pawelke et al (1997), where the measurements were made promptly
after irradiations. In this case, the contribution of short-lived isotopes populating the
plateau was higher compared to the measurements at 212.12A and 259.5A MeV. One
can note that the calculations by Pawelke et al (1997) also show the peak-to-plateau
ratio, which is higher than expected from their measurements.

7. Comparison of dose and β+ activity distributions in diﬀerent materials

In order to use the PET method for dose monitoring, the employed calculational
tool must well describe both the dose and β+-activity distributions. As the β+-
activity distributions were considered above, we can study now the corresponding dose
distributions calculated with MCHIT, which one can verify then with corresponding
experimental data.

The data on dose distributions in PMMA phantoms are rather scarce. Matsufuji
et al (2003) have performed such measurements for beams of 4He, 12C, 20Ne, 28Si and
40Ar nuclei. In ﬁgure 4 the calculated dose distribution for 279.2 A MeV 12C nuclei
in PMMA is compared with experimental data of Matsufuji et al (2003).

As known, the charged particle range in a material of a given chemical composition
is inversely proportional to the density of electrons, and hence, to the matter density ρ.
In particular, it is quite common to present the depth-dose distributions as functions
of the areal density x · ρ by rescaling the depth x. Then, if dE/dx is known at one
density, it can be easily calculated for other density. Strictly speaking, this scaling
procedure is fully justiﬁed only for a given material at various densities. However, one
can try to use it also for diﬀerent tissue-like materials.

In ﬁgure 4 the scaling property was used to compare the calculated dose and
β+-activity distributions in water with those in PMMA and dense bone tissue. The
bone tissue composition was taken in the following mass fractions: H - 6.4 %, C -

MeV and (c) 292.5A MeV 12C nuclei in PMMA phantom. The distribution of
actual e+ annihilation points is shown by the long-dashed histogram, while the
distributions which account for a ﬁnite spatial PET resolution (convoluted with
Gaussians of FWHM = 8 and 10 mm) are shown by the solid and short-dashed
histograms, respectively. The experimental data are shown by light solid lines:

27.8%, N - 2.7 %, O - 41%, Mg - 0.2 %, P - 7%, S - 0.2 %, Ca - 14.7 %. The
distributions in PMMA and bone were stretched in depth by factors of 1.16 and
1.74, respectively, which are close to the density ratios, ρPMMA/ρwater = 1.18 and

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

12

ρbone/ρwater = 1.85. In order to account for the changed bin size, all the histogram
counts were multiplied by the inverse factors, 1/1.16 and 1/1.74, respectively. Plotted
as functions of water-equivalent depth, the dose and β+-activity proﬁles in water and
PMMA are in very good agreement with each other despite of the diﬀerence in the
chemical compositions of PMMA (C5H8O2) and water (H2O). However, the calculated
position of the Bragg peak is ∼ 4 mm deeper in water compared to the depth-dose
proﬁle measured by Matsufuji et al (2003). As discussed by Gudowska et al (2004),
the position of the Bragg peak in experiment was determined with an accuracy of
±3 mm. This discrepancy can be related to the uncertainty in the initial energy of
the carbon beam. In order to obtain the agreement with the experimental data by
Matsufuji et al (2003) the data were shifted by 4.2 mm towards the higher depth, see
ﬁgure 4. This is exactly the same shift, which was used by Gudowska et al (2004) to
obtain the agreement between the data and the results of their SHIELD-HIT code.

As shown in ﬁgure 4, the β+-activity distributions in water and PMMA can be
successfully transformed from one material to another by rescaling. However, this
procedure fails for another pair of materials, water and bone tissue, see ﬁgure 4. The-
peak-to-plateau ratio for the β+-activity distribution in bone tissue is lower compared
to water due to the diﬀerence in their elemental compositions. As explained above, this

Positron emitting nuclei in proton and heavy-ion therapy

13

peak mainly consists of 11C nuclei. Such nuclei are produced relatively less frequently
in collisions of 12C projectiles with target nuclei of bone tissue, which are, on average,
more heavy compared with water. In addition, a larger part of the total β+-activity
(∼ 10%) in bone tissue is due to 13N, 14O, 17F, 18F and 30P nuclei, which are produced
in target fragmentation reactions. This contribution, which also includes the reactions
induced by secondary nucleons beyond the Bragg peak, is characterized by a ﬂat depth-
distribution.

We believe that after appropriate validation, our Monte Carlo approach can be
used for calculating β+-activity proﬁles in various materials, as an alternative method
to the scaling transformation.

8. Conclusion

In the present work the validation of the GEANT4 toolkit for calculations in particle
therapy is extended to the studies of the β+-activity distributions induced by proton
and 12C beams. Despite the fact that these β+-activity distributions diﬀer in shape
from the corresponding dose distributions, there exists a strong correlation between
them, which can be used for the dose and range monitoring via measuring β+-activity
proﬁles. Since human tissues and organs have various nuclear compositions, only
detailed Monte Carlo simulations of proton and carbon-ion therapy are able to account
for the diﬀerences in β+-activity distributions existing for diﬀerent kinds of tissues,
e.g. soft tissues and bones

Our MCHIT application based on the GEANT4 toolkit is able to predict with
reasonable accuracy (1) the total yields of 11C and 15O nuclei, which are the most
abundant β+-emitters produced by proton and 12C beams, (2) distributions of e+
annihilation points as measured by PET scanners with a realistic spatial resolution.
By this study, the ability of the GEANT4 toolkit to correctly simulate the dose
and β+-activity distributions in the proton and carbon ion therapy has been clearly
demonstrated. Therefore, we suggest the MCHIT model for realistic calculations of
β+-activity proﬁles and dose distributions in proton and carbon-ion therapy.

Abstract

Invasive electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings of ten patients suﬀering
from focal epilepsy were analyzed using the method of renormalized entropy.
Introduced as a complexity measure for the diﬀerent regimes of a dynamical
system, the feature was tested here for its spatio-temporal behavior in epilep-
tic seizures.
In all patients a decrease of renormalized entropy within the
ictal phase of seizure was found. Furthermore, the strength of this decrease
is monotonically related to the distance of the recording location to the fo-
cus. The results suggest that the method of renormalized entropy is a useful
procedure for clinical applications like seizure detection and localization of
epileptic foci.

I. INTRODUCTION

Focal epilepsies are characterized by seizures which originate from a distinct region of
the brain. The identiﬁcation of this so called epileptogenic focus is a prerequisite for surgical
treatment. Thus much attention is paid to the characterization of invasive electroencephalo-
graph (EEG) recordings of patients suﬀering from this disease. Competitive techniques like
high-resolution positron-emission tomography or MRI using speciﬁc ligands or metabolites
are used as alternative to localize the epileptogenic focus in order to avoid invasive EEG
recordings. For the time being no superiority of either method has been established yet
[1–4]. Any method will be preferred which has a better spatial and timewise resolution than
the other with acceptable validity. Within this scenario a new approach in EEG-analysis is
described in this paper.
Since there is only little doubt about the nonlinearity of the dynamical system underlying the
observed time series a broad range of nonlinear analysis techniques has been applied to these
data. As one of the ﬁrst results of nonlinear EEG analysis indication of low-dimensional
chaos was reported by Babloyanz and Destexhe [5] who claimed a noninteger correlation di-
mension in the EEG recording of a petit mal seizure. Furthermore, Frank et al. [6] obtained
positive Lyapunov exponents by analyzing two seizure recordings. Similar eﬀects, giving
indication of chaotic behavior in EEG data, were also described by Freeman and Skarda
[7], Dvorak and Siska [8], Basar and Bullock [9] and Pijn et al. [10]. Windowed estimates
of these measures for piecewise classiﬁcation of EEG were used by Lehnertz and Elger [11],
Tirsch et al. [12], Pritchard et al. [13] and Iasemidis and Sackellares [14]. Lehnertz et al. [11]
analyzed the EEG recordings of 20 patients suﬀering form unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy.
The variability of the correlation dimension, estimated for subsequent segments of the EEG,
was found to be a good indicator of the lateralisation of the epileptic focus. In a case study
Lerner [15] found the correlation integral itself to be suitable to detect seizure activity in an
EEG recording.
By now it is well appreciated that results, obtained by use of these measures, have to be
interpreted with care. Several investigators [16–18] have especially shown that the value of
the correlation dimension is inﬂuenced by computational as well as recording parameters.
Theiler et al. [19] found no evidence for low-dimensional chaos when re-examining EEG data
of 110 patients. The ﬁnite correlation dimensions, they obtained for the same data sets in
an earlier study [20], were found to be caused by an artifact of the autocorrelation in the
oversampled signals.
A methodologically diﬀerent approach is based on the examination of neural spike trains
which might be observed in the EEG of epileptic patients. In a basic implementation the
statistical properties like mean, variance or skewness of the interspike interval distribution
are used to characterize the EEG. Although this method neglects the sequence of these in-
tervals it is proven to be of practical use for some applications [21]. However, for analysis of
epileptic seizures advanced methods seemed to be necessary, i.e sequence-sensitive methods
[22–25]. Using a sequence-sensitive complexity measure Rapp et al.
found a decrease of
nonrandom structure of these sequences in focal epileptic seizures induced in rats by appli-
cation of penicillin [26].
A qualitative characterization of epileptic seizures is given by Heyden et al. [27]. Their
results, obtained by analyzing EEG data of patients suﬀering from mesial temporal lobe

2

epilepsy, indicate that the property of reversibility of a time series can be used to discrimi-
nate between seizure and non-seizure activity. Casdagli et al. [28] report recurrent activity
to occur in spatio-temporal patterns related to the location of an epileptic focus.
In the present paper a procedure is described which seems to be appropriate to classify the
EEG of epileptic patients in an uniform way. The method of renormalized entropy, proposed
in [29] for classiﬁcation of the diﬀerent states of a dynamical system, is applied to the EEG
data of ten patients suﬀering from temporal lobe epilepsy. The method is tested for its abil-
ity to assign a given segment of an EEG time series to the corresponding neurophysiological
state of the epileptic patient, i.e. interictal, ictal or posictal phase, as well as its use for
localization of an epileptic focus.

II. RENORMALIZED ENTROPY

Applying Klimontovich’s S-theorem [30] to Fourier spectra of scalar time series, Saparin
et al. [29] introduced renormalized entropy as a complexity measure for the diﬀerent regimes
of a dynamical system. Here each regime is represented by the normalized Fourier spectrum
Si(ω) of one observable xi(t) which, in formal analogy to classical statistical physics, is
viewed at as a distribution function of an open system.
Given a reference distribution Sr(ω), representing the systems state of equilibrium, the
relative degree of order of the regime described by Si(ω) is determined by comparing the
entropies of these two distributions under the additional constraint of same mean energy in
both states. To this end an eﬀective Hamiltonian

is introduced and the reference spectrum is renormalized (”heated up”) into

Hef f = − ln Sr(ω)

so that holds:

and

˜Sr(ω) = C(Ti)e

Ti = C(Ti)Sr(ω)1/Ti,

− Hef f (ω)

˜Sr(ω)Hef f (ω)dω =

Si(ω)Hef f (ω)dω

Z

Z

˜Sr(ω)dω = 1.

Z

Here eq. (3) ensures the equality of mean energies of the two states, eq. (4) the normalization
of the renormalized spectrum. C(Ti) is a normalization factor depending on Ti.
Renormalized entropy now is given by:

∆H =

˜Sr(ω) ln ˜Sr(ω)dω −

Si(ω) ln Si(ω)dω .

Z

Z

Applying this method to the diﬀerent regimes of the logistic map, Saparin et al. [29] found
renormalized entropy to clearly detect all transitions between the diﬀerent types of periodic

behavior as well as the diﬀerent types of chaos. Kurths et al. [31] and Voss et al. [32] analyzed
the heart rate variability of patients after myocardial infarction. They report renormalized
entropy to be a suitable method for the detection of high risk patients threatened by sudden
cardiac death.
Because of eq. (1) the method can only be applied to processes which have a purely positive
spectrum, i. e. chaotic or stochastic processes. Because spectra of such processes have to
be estimated the spectrum chosen as reference should be of lower energy than each other
state of the system to avoid ”temperatures” Ti less than 1. ”Cooling down” an estimated
spectrum increases the variance of the estimate and therefore the variance of the estimated
entropy.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE EEG

The EEG data analyzed in this study were recorded using chronically implanted subdural
and intrahippocampal electrodes measuring the local ﬁeld potential.The obtained signals
were passed to a multi-channel ampliﬁer system with band-pass ﬁlter settings of 0.53Hz −
85Hz and were written to a digital storage device with a sampling interval of ∆t = 5.76 ms
per channel. Fig. 1 displays representative samples of the obtained time series for diﬀerent
phases of an epileptic seizure. For each recording the identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent phases
was done by experienced clinicians by visual inspection of the time series.
For analysis the data of each channel were divided into consecutive segments xi,. of length
N = 4096 with a 50% overlap. The length corresponds to a duration of 24 s per epoch and
was chosen to achieve at least quasi-stationarity for each segment according to [33].
To apply the method described above to these data the spectrum of each segment has to be
estimated and for each channel a reference spectrum has to be found.
To estimate the spectra Si the periodograms

were smoothed:

As smoothing kernel wu the Bartlett-Priestley window was chosen [34]:

P eri(ωk) = 1/N |

Xj=1

Variance and bias of the estimator depend on the width B = 2b+1 of the smoothing window
and the structure of the true spectrum. To ﬁnd an appropriate value for the window width
the spectral entropy

was calculated as function of B for diﬀerent segments. Fig.2a shows the plot obtained for
one segment of an EEG. The graph can be divided into two regions. For small values of B
the ﬂuctuations of the periodogram are suppressed insuﬃciently: because each summand in
eq. (9) is a convex function of S(ωk) the spectral entropy is underestimated. In this region
the estimated spectral entropy increases fast with increasing B. For large values of B there is
an area of small increase where the periodogram is oversmoothed. Since information about
the structure of the spectrum is lost, in this region the spectral entropy is overestimated.
Fig.2b shows the corresponding plot for one realization of an AR(2) process

X(t) = a1X(t − 1) + a2X(t − 2) + ǫ(t)

(10)

a1 = 1.3, a2 = −0.75 and ǫ(t) ∈ WN (0, 1).

of length N = 4096. This process describes a damped linear oscillator driven by white noise
[35]. The functional relationship between the parameters a1,a2 and the frequency ω and
relaxation time τ of the oscillator is given by:

Because this process is linear its spectral entropy can be calculated analytically:

a1 = 2 cos ωe−1/τ
a2 = −e−2/τ

.

S(ωk) ln S(ωk)

S(ωk) =

with

with

C a normalizing constant. As the plot shows the true value of spectral entropy, denoted by
the horizontal line in Fig.2b, is reached in the area of transition from high to low increase
of spectral entropy. Therefore, a value of B = 33 from this region in Fig.2a was chosen for
the analysis of the EEG.
To calculate the renormalized entropy of the EEG spectra for each channel a reference Sr(ωk)
has to be chosen. As mentioned before this state should be of lower energy than each other
state of the system. Because

−

Sj(ωk) ln Sr(ωk) ≥ −

Sr(ωk) ln Sr(ωk)

holds for every j if

Xk

the spectrum of lowest spectral entropy (eq. (9)) was chosen as reference. If postictal phase
of an epileptic seizure diﬀered from interictal phase the corresponding segment was found in

the beginning of the postictal phase resulting in a course of renormalized entropy shown in
Fig.3. Otherwise the reference was found in the interictal phase. Fig.3 also shows that the
conventional spectral entropy as given by eq. (9) does not serve as a feature characterizing
the ictal phase.
To test and compare the behavior of the renormalized entropy in an epileptic seizure, EEG
data of all patients were analyzed using the method of renormalized entropy as well as simple
features like the variance

or the squared euclidean distance

of spectra. For determination of the euclidean distance the spectra were calculated in the
same way as were done for calculation of renormalized entropy. Also the distance was
calculated with respect to the same reference spectrum to achieve results comparable to
these obtained by use of renormalized entropy. A representative sample is given in Fig.4. In
Fig.4a the EEG recording, in Fig.4b the course of the estimated variance and in Fig.4c the
course of the squared euclidean distance obtained for this recording are shown. By means of
these simple characteristics a reliable identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent phases (interictal, ictal
and postictal phase) of an epileptic seizure is not possible. The squared euclidean distance
which was chosen as alternative and more elementary distance measure of spectra fails
to distinguish between the diﬀerent phases. The variance detects the ictal phase but miss-
classiﬁes a later postictal segment of the EEG. By way of contrast, the course of renormalized
entropy reveals a temporary strong decrease only within the ictal phase.
To investigate the spatial behavior of renormalized entropy, for each patient up to eight
channels, corresponding to recording locations of diﬀerent distance to the epileptic focus,
were analyzed. In all patients the value of renormalized entropy within the ictal phase was
found to decrease with decreasing distance of the recording location to the epileptic focus, as
shown for a representative example in Fig.5. Thus, a technical device for localizing epileptic
foci, based on the concept of renormaized entropy, is imaginable.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The method of renormalized entropy, formally introduced to quantify the complexity of
the diﬀerent regimes of a dynamical system, has been applied to invasive EEG recordings of
ten patients suﬀering from temporal lobe epilepsy.
In all patients the course of renormalized entropy obtained for recording locations nearby
the epileptic focus shows a strong decrease in the ictal phase of an epileptic seizure with
respect to the interictal or postictal phase. Because the strength of this decrease depends
on the distance of the recording location to the focus not only a discrimination between the
diﬀerent phases but also a localization of the focus seems to be possible.
The method makes exclusively use of the spectral properties of the time series under consid-
eration and therefore human interaction is restricted to the choice of the spectral estimator

6

to be used.
Putting it altogether the concept of renormalized entropy seems to be a promising candidate
for clinical applications like seizure detection or localization of epiletic foci.

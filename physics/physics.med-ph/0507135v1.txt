Abstract

We show that force plate measurements provide a noninvasive method to display the motion
of the heart muscle and the subsequent propagation of the pulse wave along aorta and its
branches.

I

Introduction

The aim of this paper is to present a new method to handle multivariate time series obtained
by force plate measurements. The proposed technique is subsequently used to display marks of
cardiac activity.

We understand the measured time series as coordinate projections of a multidimensional curve.
To extract information contained in the signal we will investigate the geometric properties of
this curve. In particular we focus on invariants describing the curve as a geometrical complex.
Such invariants do not change when the curve is rotated, translated or its parametrization is
changed. This is in contrast with the coordinate projections (measured signals) that change under
such transformations. A measured signal changes if we modify for instance the allocation of the
electrodes during electrocardiographic measurement (ECG). The recorded process, i.e. the electric
activity of the heart, however, does not depend on the particular position of the electrodes. So the
main hypothesis presented here is that a process is adequately reﬂected by the total curve and not
merely by its projections i.e. by the particularly measured signals.

The geometrical invariants used to describe a multidimensional curve are related to the Cartan
- Frenet - Serret concept of moving frames and are known as Cartan curvatures [1].
(Similar
methods are used for instance to describe the space time geometry in the general relativity theory
of Einstein.) We will demonstrate that the processes causing changes in the measured signal
manifest themselves as rapid changes (peaks) in the Cartan curvatures.

Force plate is a device that measures the components of a force and of the related force
moments acting on a speciﬁed platform. It exploits four sets of transducers located in the four
corners of the plate. Since the force vector is, by deﬁnition, perpendicular to its moment, only ﬁve
of the six measured quantities are in fact independent. Hence a measurement of the load dynamics
leads to ﬁve independent time series. They are usually represented by the three force components
together with the point where this force acts on the platform. The point of application of the force
provides only two-dimensional information since it is bound to the upper platform of the force
plate. This point can be easily calculated from measured moments and forces.

In medicine the plate is usually used to measure forces exchanged between the subject’s
feet and the ﬂoor (ground reaction). Thus, it can be used for various tests, such as a study

1

of maintaining of human balance during quiet upright stance, weight lifting analysis, stability and
co-ordination tests or gait analysis.

Our aim here is to demonstrate the facilities of the geometric signal analysis. This is why we
focus on a subtle process, namely on the force manifestation of the cardiac activity and hemody-
namics. Cardiac activity aﬀects of course the balance and its interference with the postural sway
was studied for instance in [2, 3].

To eliminate the interference of the cardiac activity with postural changes and body tremor

we measured the subjects in a horizontal position lying on a special bed, cf. [4].

For a reclining subject the motion of the internal masses within the body has a crucial eﬀect
on the displacement of the center of gravity (COG) of the body and on the ground reactions of
the plate. When a bed with the lying subject is placed onto the force plate, measured ground
reaction forces contain information on the blood mass transient ﬂow at each heartbeat and on
the movement of the heart itself. (There are also other sources of the internal mass motion that
cannot be suppressed, like the stomach activity etc, but they are much slower and do not display
a periodic-like pattern.)

Rapid heart contract or expand movements such as e.g. isovolumetric contraction or valve
opening are not associated with a signiﬁcant reorganization of the internal mass. Hence they lead
- due to the action/reaction principle - to rapid changes of the ground reaction force without large
changes of COG position. The motion of the heart muscle and the related blood ﬂow imply on the
contrary an signiﬁcant internal mass motion. The resulting changes of the ground reaction force
are in this case accompanied with substantial changes of the force moments and hence of COG.

The blood ﬂow is associated with a pulse wave that runs mainly on the large elastic arteries
(aorta and its main branches) and interacts with the vessel branchings. At a branching, the
incoming pulse wave is partially reﬂected and partially divided into the (two or more) branched
vessels. Such interaction between the pulse wave and the vessel branching leads again to changes
in the measured signal.

The study of the motion of the body related to the heart activity is usually called ballistocar-
diography. Discovered in the 19th century, ballistocardiography was studied extensively from the
1930s until the late 1960s, see e.g. [3]. Most of the early ballistocardiographs (BCG) tracked the
movement on a special bed on which the patient lay. Later, various accelerometers attached di-
rectly to various places of the body (most often to the sternum) were used for the BCG acquisition.
However, these direct methods survey only one-dimensional accelerations.

The cardiac activity has a quasiperiodic character and is triggered by an electric signal that
can be monitored by ECG. Simultaneous measurement of the ECG signal and of the subsequent
mechanical reaction of the cardiovascular system provide interesting information. For instance
estimating the time delay between the opening of the aortal valve and the arrival of the pulse
wave to the mesenteric artery branching provide an information about the pulse wave velocity and
hence about the elasticity of the aorta. An unexpected pulse wave reﬂection can give a hint on a
presence of stenoses or aneurism etc.

Using geometrical invariants of the signal curve we can identify signiﬁcant mechanical events
like valve opening, arriving of the pulse wave to the abdominal aorta branchings etc. The proposed
method has been tested on a group of volunteers. The obtained results are reproducible, i.e. they
lead to the same results when we repeat the measurement with the same person (although they
are slightly diﬀerent when diﬀerent people are measured ). It has also to be stressed that only
the mechanical response of the force platform and the ECG signal are measured, i.e. the proposed
method is fully noninvasive.

II Experiment and data processing

A Bertec force plate, model 4060A, working on the strain gauge technology principle was used. Its
length was 0.6 m and its width was 0.4 m. Forces and moments were measured with respect to
the following reference system: x-axis parallel to the shorter side of the top plate, y-axis along the

2

longer side of the top plate and z-axis vertical downwards, such as to form a right-hand reference
system. A specially constructed metallic bed was placed onto the force plate with a head pointing
to the positive y-direction. The relevant electrical outputs were ampliﬁed by a selectable gain in an
external unit and then digitalized by a 12 bit A/D converter. An electrocardiographic (ECG) signal
was recorded simultaneously using the same acquisition system. In selected cases we measured also
the acoustic signal caused by the heart movement (phonocardiograph) using a sensitive microphone
placed inside the tube of the stethoscope. All the data were acquired at a sampling rate 1000 Hz.
A sample of seventeen healthy adult males was investigated after informed consent had been
obtained. Subjects were ﬁrst asked to lie down on back onto the bed. They were instructed to
lie quietly without any voluntary movement and to breathe normally. Data acquisition lasted
eight minutes. Three subjects were measured twice with at least one-day pause between. For
comparison, we also measured a patient with abdominal aorta aneurysm.

Simultaneous measurement of the force plate output and the ECG signal leads to a seven
dimensional time series. (This series is eight dimensional when the acoustic signal is also measured).
To avoid noise we ﬁltered all channels by an one dimensional Gaussian ﬁlter with a halfwidth of
10 ms. Our aim is to look for marks the heart movement and hemodynamics leaves in the six
mechanical signals measured by the force plate. These signals represent the force plate reaction
on the motion of/inside the body and present a projection of the related forces into the coordinate
system ﬁxed on the plate. In such a way a given signal depends not only on the hemodynamical
process but also on the position of the body on the bed, on the position of the heart muscle inside
the body etc.

To avoid dependencies of this type we will work with an abstract geometrical characterization
of the signal. Namely, we will regard the data as a time parameterized curve in the Euclidean
space R6. According to the Frenet - Serret theory a regular n-dimensional curve is uniquely deter-
mined by n − 1 curvatures, see e.g. [1]. This description is unique up to Euclidean transformations
and therefore suitable for our purposes since it leads to a representation of the process that is
independent on rigid motions, (translations and rotations) i.e. independent on the exact position
and orientation of the measured subject as well as on the particular curve parametrization.

Mathematically the Frenet theory is based on the concept of local coordinate frames that are
associated with the curve. One axis of the local frame is tangential to the curve, the second axis
represents the normal, the third is the binormal etc. Let us consider a smooth n-dimensional
curve c, i.e. a mapping I → Rn with I ⊂ R being an interval. Assuming that the deriva-
tives c′(t), c′′(t), . . . c(n−1)(t) of c(t) exist and are linearly independent for every t ∈ I, there
exists unique family (E1(t), . . . , En(t)) of orthonormal n-dimensional vectors having a positive ori-
entation, so that for every k, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, the kth derivative c(k)(t) is a linear combination
of (E1, . . . , Ek) for every t ∈ I. The family (E1(t), . . . , En(t)) is called the distinguished Frenet
frame. The curvatures κi, i = 1, . . . n − 1 of the curve c are deﬁned using Frenet-Serret formulae
as

κi(t) =

E′

i(t) · Ei+1(t)
kc′(t)k

.

Hence the curvatures characterize local changes of the coordinate system related with the curve.
In our case the signal curve is 6 dimensional and is characterized by 5 curvatures.

A mechanical event like a mass motion inside the body or the scattering of a pulse wave on
arterial bifurcations leads to changes in the force plate response. It might be diﬃcult to trace out
the response by inspecting directly the time series representing the force and moment projections.It
is however reasonable to assume that a presence of such an event will locally change the geometry
of the total signal curve and will be visible as a local change of its invariants.

To ﬁlter out the information related to the hemodynamics we use the fact that this process is
quasiperiodic and triggered by the ECG signal cf. [5]. We take the ECG R wave as the initializing
event and regard the hemodynamics as being time locked with it. We will therefore evaluate the
curvatures for time periods of 800 ms after each R wave and ﬁnally take the mean over all R waves.
A similar method is used when an evoked brain activity is studied. In this case the brain activity
is triggered by an external stimulus (for instance a periodic ﬂashing light) and a the brain response

3

is studied by taking the mean of the EEG signal over all stimuli. The paradigm to be followed
is related to the hypothesis that the intestine hemodynamical events change the direction of the
signal curve and are therefore associated with clear maxima of the averaged curvatures.

III Results

The ejection of blood by ventricular contraction spreads over the elastic central arteries. The
augmentation propagates in a form of a pulse wave along the arteries and converts ﬁnally the
pulsatile action of the heart into continuous laminar blood ﬂow. On branching places of large
arteries the pulse wave is scattered and the subsequent elastic recoil contribute to the force changes
measured by the plate. A similar recoil is expected also when the artery changes promptly its
direction (like for instance in the aortal arc).

The main event of this type is the scattering of the pulse wave on the branching of the
abdominal aorta into the two iliac arteries. After this reﬂection a part of the wave propagates
backwards through the aorta whereas the transmitted wave continues its down movement along
the iliac arteries. When passing a branching point the reﬂected wave leads to similar (but weaker)
recoil as the original wave. It is partially bounced back, i.e. propagates in the same direction as
the primary wave and so on. This means that the prime measured events are accompanied with
echoes, i.e. with secondary events that are placed symmetrically on the time axis. For instance the
renal artery branching (and narrowing of the aorta at this place) leads to a well measured event.
It is subsequently followed by the event triggered by the iliac bifurcation that leads to a massive
bounce back of the pulse wave. Next it is followed by an echo of the renal artery event evoked
by the bounced wave. Hence the primary renal event and its echo are placed symmetrically with
respect to the iliac bifurcation time. Generally the presence of echoes presents a diﬃculty by the
ﬁnal interpretation of the signal. Especially by elderly persons when the elasticity of the artery is
already reduced and the scattering events are more pronounced.

Another fact to be mentioned is the interference between the hemodynamical and cardiac
eﬀects. In particular in the second half of the cardiac cycle the hemodynamics triggered by the
heart contraction pursue to develop (and fades out) whereby the heart muscle start to prepare
itself for another beat (diastole). In such a way the force plate is inﬂuenced by both processes
simultaneously and this makes the interpretation of this period diﬃcult. This is why we will
analyze the signal starting at the R wave of the ECG signal and ending at roughly 80% of the
duration of the cardiac cycle (800 ms).

III.1 Interpretation

A typical example of the averaged ﬁrst four curvatures of the measured 6-dimensional curve is plot-
ted in the ﬁgure 1 together with the averaged ECG signal, phonocardiogram and the time behavior
of the reaction force components Fx, Fy and Fz. The overall pattern of the ﬁrst four curvatures
appears to be reproducible across the sample of all examined subjects. The ﬁfth curvature could
not be classiﬁed because of a high level of noise.

In particular, we have identiﬁed 7 peaks in the ﬁrst curvature that reﬂect direct hemodynamical
events - see ﬁgure 2. These peaks are visible in all measured subjects and most of them appear
also in the other three curvatures.

The marked peaks can be assigned to particular hemodynamical events as follows.

• Peak 1:

appears 50 ms after the R wave together with the onset of the ﬁrst heart sound.
It is followed by the

This peak reﬂects the enclosure of the tricuspid and mitral valves.
isovolumetric contraction of the heart muscle.

• Peak 2:

reﬂects the isovolumetric contraction of the heart muscle. Typically this peak

appears 75 ms after the R wave.

4

• Peak 3: This smaller peak reﬂects the opening of the aortic and pulmonary valves and
ventricular contraction. It is accompanied by the increase of the intensity of the ﬁrst heart
sound that is caused by oscillations and turbulency of the ejected blood. The peak appears
250 ms before the onset of the second heart sound and approximately 110 ms after the
appearance of the R wave.

• Peak 4:

reﬂects the scattering of the pulse wave on the pulmonary artery bifurcation. It
shows up sometimes is form of two peaks due to the recoil of the pulse wave on the complex
branchings of the pulmonary artery. The doubling of the pulse waveform has been measured
also with the help of pulmonary arterial catheterization. This peaks appear with a time delay
of 110-140 ms.

The peaks 3 and 4 become in some cases very close and merge to a single blurred peak.

• Peak 5:

reﬂects the passage of the pulse wave through the aortal arch and is a consequence
of the sudden change in the direction of the pulse wave. It is accompanied with a fading of
the ﬁrst heart sound. It succeeds the peak 4 since the ascending part of the aorta is longer
then the length of the ascending part of the pulmonary artery. Its typical time delay with
respect to the R wave is 170-190 ms.

• Peak 6: Reﬂect the scattering on the sequence of the abdominal aortal branchings. When
the subject reclines on belly the peak is usually more pronounced or even splits into two
narrow peaks. Moreover the ﬁnal abdominal branching (renal branching) is accompanied
also with a narrowing of the aorta. Its diameter changes form approximately 2 cm to 1.3 cm
and this leads to a well pronounced scattering event. The peak 6 appears typically 280-330
ms after the R wave onset.

• Peak 7:

is related to the iliac branching of the aorta and represents the most pronounced
pulse wave reﬂection during the cardiac cycle. It emerges with a time delay of 400 - 480 ms
after the R wave of the ECG signal.

All the above described curvature maxima were visible by all measured subject and are directly
related to well deﬁned morphological structures. They are, however, followed, by 2 or 3 further
curvature peaks that are not of a clear morphological origin. An typical example of this type of
peaks are the maxima denoted in the ﬁgure 2 as 8 and 9. They appear with time delays exceeding
500 ms. Moreover they form an almost periodic pattern. These peaks are easily explained as
echoes of the renal branching reﬂection. The point is that, as already mentioned, the branching of
the abdominal aorta into the common iliac arteries leads to the utmost reﬂection of the pulse wave.
Part of the pulse wave travels back, is again scattered by the renal branching and appears as an
echo of the original renal curvature peak (peak 8). The scattering continues by backscattering that
travels downwards the aorta. So the next maximum (peak 9) appears as an echo of the original
iliac branching (peak 7). In majority of cases one more peak (labelled as 10) is visible representing
a second echo of the peak 6. Since peaks 8 and 9 are nothing but echoes of the peaks 6 and 7
respectively the time dependence of the forces measured by the plate has to display a symmetry
against the related reﬂection point. We demonstrate this fact in the ﬁgure 3.

On the upper part of the ﬁgure the ﬁrst curvature is displayed as a function of the second
force component. The peaks are labelled by numbers 6 − 10. The symmetry of the force behavior
and oscillatory character of the process is clearly visible.

A direct insight into the reﬂection process is obtained by patients with pathological changes
on the abdominal aorta. Usually the detailed structure of the aorta is in this case known from
the angiographical screening. The pathological changes lead however also to changes in the signal
measured by the force plate.
In such a way new curvature peaks appear and can be directly
ascribed to the pathological aortal structures.

To demonstrate the existence of the above described oscillations we measured a man with
abdominal aneurism. The aneurism was localized between the renal and iliac branchings. The
pulse wave reﬂection on the aneurism leads to the appearance of a sharp curvature peak that is

5

localized between the standard “renal” and “iliac” peaks. The strong reﬂection on the aneurism
and the consequent backscattering leads also to a rise of additive echo of the renal peak. This
echo, however, falls into the same time interval as the peak caused by the iliac branching which
means that this peak appears blurred. After the iliac scattering the backward pulse wave hits the
aneurism again and is scattered there. An echo of the aneurism scattering is the consequence. The
distance between the iliac branching and the aneurism is smaller then the distance to the renal
branching. Hence the aneurism echo appears in shorter times then the renal echo by healthy people.
The subsequent oscillations display therefore a much shorter period then by healthy subjects. We
have compared the results of the patient with a result obtained by healthy volunteer of the same
height and displayed them in the ﬁgure 4.

We have measured subjects also lying on the belly. The results are very similar to those with
subjects resting on their back. The only diﬀerence is that usually the curvature peaks related to
the abdominal aorta branchings are more expressed. Also peaks related to the motion of the heart
muscle ale more explicit. It is related to the fact that lying on the belly the chest of the subject is
in direct contact with the bed and the heart motion is better transferred to the force plate.

IV Discussion

First we have to comment on the fact that the height of the curvature peaks is not directly related
to the strength of the reﬂection. Curvature is an abstract and purely geometric characterization
of the process. Its peaks reﬂects changes of the local reference system bound to the signal curve.
Hence they provide information about the times the inherent processes starts and ends (sharp peaks
are related to quick changes). But they do not give a direct reference on the process strength.

Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) is widely accepted as an index of aortic stiﬀness with
the application of predicting risk of heart disease in individuals [6]. Since aorta is not directly
accessible various methods are used to obtain the value of PWV on various aortic parts. Some
of them are invasive using catheters with micromanometric sensors [7]. Other methods are based
on high sampling rate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of various aortal segments [8, 9]. The
curvature analysis of the force plate data oﬀers another way to obtain aortic PWV.

Knowing the reﬂection times T1 and T2 of two events and the approximate distance L between
the two reﬂection points, PWV can be easily established as v = L/(T2 − T1). The total length L
of a human aorta (ascending aorta + aortic arch + descending aorta up to the iliac branching) is
L ≈ 70 cm [10]. The two relevant events used are the opening of the aortic valve (peak No 3) and
the iliac branching reﬂection (peak No. 7). The obtained PWV is equal to approximately 3.9 m/s
and is in full agreement with the values obtained by the MRI and manometric measurements.

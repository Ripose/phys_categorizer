Noise-induced ﬁrst-order transition in anti-tumor immunotherapy

We studied the single-variable dynamics model of the tumor growth. A ﬁrst-order phase transition
induced by an additive noise is shown to reproduce the main features of tumor growth under immune
surveillance. The critical average cells population has a power-law function relationship with the
immune coeﬃcient.

During the past two decades, due to the increasing
abilities of scientists to manipulate molecule, studies of
tumor immunology and immunotherapy have entered the
mainstream of current studies in immunology and cancer
research [1-3]. Simultaneously, with the development of
mathematics and computation science, more and more
attempts conﬁrm that simple math can model a world of
complexity [4]. Mathematics is then respected to bring
about astonishment into oncology. Generally, dynam-
ics diﬀerential equations are used to describe the growth
and diﬀusion phenomenon of biology including tumors
[5, 6]. However, there are some deﬁciencies for determi-
nate diﬀerential equation in depicting the instability and
complexity of biology. Recently, to ﬁll these deﬁciencies,
stochastic noise was introduced into the dynamics equa-
tion [7, 8].

Phase transitions, especially noise-induced phase tran-
sitions, had been reported in various areas including on-
cology, mathematical biology and biological physics [7-
12]. In Ref.[8] and [11], it was reported that multiplica-
tive noise induces a transition in tumor growth. Regret-
fully, two references above have yet not speciﬁed the role
of additive noise as well as what kind of the phase transi-
tion it is. Here we explore what to our knowledge is the
ﬁrst dynamical analysis of the noise-induced ﬁrst-order
transition in an anti-tumor immunotherapy model.

Lefever and Garay [13] studied the tumor growth un-
der immune surveillance against cancer using enzyme dy-
namics model. The model is

in which X, P, E0 and E are respectively cancer cells,
dead cancer cells, immune cells and the compound of
cancer cells and immune cells, γ, λ, k1, k2, k3 are velocity
coeﬃcients. This model reveals that normal cells may
transform into cancer cells, and then the cancer cells re-
produce, decline and die out ultimately. Qi and Du had

ever derived its equivalent single-variable deterministic
dynamics equation [11]. Obviously, a ﬂuctuation of tu-
mor cells population is inevitable, which results from the
change of the environment as well as the intrinsic insta-
bility of a tumor. Therefore, it is more reasonable to
consider the stochastic diﬀerential equation. Model (1)
is then described by the Langiven equation

here X is the cancer cells population, r0 , K and β are
the linear per capita birth rate, the carrying capacity
of the environment and the anti-tumor ability of im-
mune cells respectively. ξ(t) is the Gaussian white noise,
hξ(t)ξ(t
), A is the intensity of noise. Since
X is non-negative, according to the absorption boundary
condition, then X(t) can be done. We deﬁne an order
parameter, hXi, i.e., the average tumor cells population,
whose form is given by

)i = Aδ(t − t

′

where τ 0 is the initial time as X(t) reach a stable-state
distribution. τ − τ 0 is the stable-state periodicity. The
”dynamic” four-order cumulant ratio UX is

hXi =

UX = 1 −

which is useful for determining the location of a phase
transition [14].

In a discussion of additive noise in tumor growth, Ai
et al [8] reported that additive noise leads tumor cells far
from extinction. They presented the ﬁxedness of peak
position of the stable-state distribution probability in-
duced by the additive noise, which denotes no transition
induced by any additive noise. Here we suggested it is
because the potential function they concerned is an uni-
stable state structure. However, the equivalent potential
function of Eq.(2) is a bi-stable state one. Fig.1. shows
that the order parameter hXi is ﬁxed under a weak noise.
As the intensity of the noise reaches an enough strength,
the order parameter undergoes a sharp transition from
non-zero to zero. This will lead to a deep minimum of
the four-order cumulant ratio UX at the transition point.
It is obviously a ﬁrst-order transition like that reported in

surveillance.
In other words, additive noise can cause
the decay of a tumor. There may be a critical nucleus
in a tumor growth, which is dependent on the immune
coeﬃcient as a power-law function.

intensity of noise and immune coeﬃcient.

and β = 1.0, respectively.

thermodynamics. This implies that noise could lead the
tumor to extinction. The critical point of the transition
is dependent upon the immune coeﬃcient β.

In the absence of noise, hXi changes continuously with
β as K < 1, i.e., there is a second-order transition in-
duced by parameter β in the growth of a tumor (see
Ref.[11]).
In the presence of noise, however, the vari-
ety of hXi with immune coeﬃcient, β, shown in Fig.2, is
of a ﬁrst-order transition under an additive noise action.
This is perhaps because of the noise-induced discontinu-
ous transition of the potential function from an uni-stable
state to a bi-stable one. The surface in Fig.2 includes two
divisions: the non-zero division of hXi, here refers to an
invalid immunity; and the zero division as a valid immu-
nity. The critical average tumor cells population, hXic,
means there exists a critical nucleus in a tumor growth,
which is the minimal volume or population for a tumor
to grow and outspread.

The relationship between critical average tumor cells
population, hXic, and immune coeﬃcient, β, is plotted
more precisely in Fig.3, which represents hXic as a power-
law function of β, which has a form with characteristic
critical exponents.

In summary, additive noise will induce a ﬁrst-order
transition in the growth of a tumor under immune

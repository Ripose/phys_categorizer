We present the multiscale entropy analysis of short term physiological time series of simultaneously
acquired samples of heart rate, blood pressure and lung volume, from healthy subjects and from
subjects with Chronic Heart Failure. Evaluating the complexity of signals at the multiple time scales
inherent in physiologic dynamics, we ﬁnd that healthy subjects show more complex time series at
large time scales; on the other hand, at fast time scales, which are more inﬂuenced by respiration, the
pathologic dynamics of blood pressure is the most random. These results robustly separate healthy
and pathologic groups. We also propose a multiscale approach to evaluate interactions between
time series, by performing a multivariate autoregressive modelling of the coarse grained time series:
this analysis provides several new quantitative indicators which are statistically correlated with the
pathology.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Physiological systems are ruled by mechanisms operating across multiple temporal scales. Many approaches have
been developed in the last years to analyze these complex signals, including, for example, studies of: Fourier spectra
[1], chaotic dynamics [2], scaling properties [3], multifractal properties [4], correlation integrals [5], 1/f spectra [6] and
synchronization properties [7]. A recently proposed approach, multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) [8], compares the
degree of complexity of time series at varying temporal scale, and has been applied to 24 hours electrocardiographic
recordings of healthy subjects, subjects with congestive heart failure, and subjects with atrial ﬁbrillation. Results from
this analysis support the general complexity − loss theory of aging and disease, since healthy and young dynamics are
the most complex.

In this paper we apply the MSE analysis to short-term simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram, respiration
signal and arterial blood pressure, from healthy subjects and from subjects with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), a
disease associated with major abnormalities of autonomic cardiovascular control.

We also consider here a multiscale version of the classical multivariate autoregressive analysis of time series, to ﬁnd
scale-dependent patterns of interactions between the physiological time series here considered. The paper is organized
as follows. In the next section we describe our data set, the methods and the results we obtain. Some conclusions are
drawn in section III.

II. DATA, METHODS AND RESULTS

We brieﬂy recall the MSE method [8]. Given a one-dimensional discrete time series, consecutive coarse grained
time series, corresponding to scale factor τ , are constructed in the following way. First, the original time series is
divided into nonoverlapping windows of length τ ; then, data points inside each window are averaged, so as to remove
ﬂuctuations with time scales smaller than τ . For scale one, the coarse grained time series is simply the original time
series; the length of each coarse grained time series is equal to the length of the original time series divided by the
scale factor τ . Finally an entropy measure SE is calculated for each coarse grained time series and plotted as function
of the scale factor τ . SE coincides with the parameter SE(m, r), introduced by Richman and Moorman [9] and termed
sample entropy, which is related to the probability that sequences from the time series, which are close (within r)

2

for m points, remain close at the subsequent data point. In the original proposal both the sequence length m and
the tolerance parameter r were kept ﬁxed as τ was varied, so that changes in SE on each scale were depending both
on the regularity and the variability of the coarse grained sequences [10]. In the present work we take r, at each τ ,
inversely proportional to the standard deviation (SD) of the coarse grained time series, and consider separately how
the SD of signals varies with the time scale.

Our data are from 47 healty subjects and 275 stable mild to moderate CHF patients in sinus rhythm admitted to
the Heart Failure Unit of the Scientiﬁc Institute of Montescano for evaluation and treatment of heart failure, usually
in conjunction with evaluation for heart transplantation. Concerning the second group, cardiac death occurred in 54
patients during a 3-year-follow-up. In two diﬀerent conditions of respiration, basal and paced breathing (at 0.25 Hz)
[11], ten minutes long physiological recordings have been made on these subjects, leading to four time series. Firstly,
the heart RR interval time series (rri); for each cardiac cycle, corresponding values of the systolic arterial pressure
sap, the diastolic arterial pressure dap and the instantaneous lung volume ilv were computed. The four time series
have then been re-sampled at 2Hz using a cubic spline interpolation. Part of this data set (the sap time series) has
been already analyzed in [12] using a diﬀerent approach.

In ﬁgure 1 we depict the standard deviations of the coarse grained time series in basal condition. Due to the short
length of the samples at our disposal, we consider τ ≤ 10 so as to have suﬃcient statistics at each scale; this implies
that our analysis will be limited to part of the High Frequency (HF) band (0.15-0.45Hz), the band in which the
respiratory rhythm of most people lies. In all cases, on average the standard deviation is a decreasing function of the
scale; healthy subjects show greater variability than patients, except for ilv signals, where patients on average have
the highest variability. Similar patterns of standard deviations are obtained in paced breathing conditions.

As already stated, to extract the sample entropy from these signals, we take r equal to a ﬁxed percentage (15%) of
the standard deviations of the coarse grained time series; we take m = 1. In ﬁgure 2 we depict the average SE of rri
time series of controls, patients and dead patients, in basal condition (high) and paced breathing (low). Concerning
the basal case, we note that controls have always signiﬁcantly higher entropy than CHF patients, at all scales, and
that dead patients show slightly more regular rri time series than the average over all patients. The severity of the
pathology seems to be correlated with the loss of entropy. On the right we depict, as a function of the scale factor τ ,
the probability that rri entropy values from controls and patients were drawn from the same distribution, evaluated
by non parametric rank sum Wilcoxon test: the discrimination is excellent at intermediate τ ’s. This picture is in
agreement with ﬁndings in [8], corresponding to controls and subjects with congestive heart failure in sinus rhythm,
except for a diﬀerent form of the entropy curve for patients, which indeed depends on the pathology. In the case of
paced breathing the three curves get closer and the discrimination, between patients and controls, reduces: paced
breathing seems, in the case of rri entropy, to reduce diﬀerences between patients and controls.

In ﬁgure 3 we depict SE of sap time series. We ﬁnd that at low τ patients have higher entropy, whilst at large
τ they have lower entropy than controls. The crossover occurs at τ = 3 in basal conditions, and τ ∼ 6 for paced
breathing. The complexity − loss paradigm, hence, here holds only for large τ . This may be explained as an eﬀect
of respiration, whose inﬂuence seems to become weaker as τ increases. This eﬀect is more evident in conditions of
paced breathing. Our results are consistent with those obtained in [12] using a diﬀerent approach and with τ = 1. It
is interesting to observe that curves corresponding to dead patients are always farther, from the controls curve, than
the average curve from all patients; departure from the controls curve seems to be connected with the severity of the
disease.

In ﬁgure 4 we consider dap time series. We ﬁnd a similar pattern to sap: patients have higher entropy at low τ and
lower entropy than controls at large τ . Again the crossover occurs at τ = 3 in basal conditions, and τ = 6 for paced
breathing.

Now we turn to consider ilv time series, as depicted in ﬁgure 5. In the basal case, controls have higher entropy at
small scales. On the other hand controls show lower entropy than patients at τ > 7: patients pathologically display
ﬂuctuations of ilv at larger scales than healthy subjects. Under paced breathing, controls are characterized by reduced
ﬂuctuations at high τ ; at τ = 4, when the window size is half of the respiration period, controls show a local minimum
of the entropy. These phenomena are not observed for patients, where paced breathing is less eﬀective in regularizing
the ilv time series.

Next we implement a multiscale version of autoregressive modelling of time series (see, e.g., [13]). For each scale
factor τ , we denote x = (rri , sap, dap, ilv ) the four-dimensional vector of the coarse grained time series. At each scale,
all coarse grained time series are normalized to have unit variance. A multivariate autoregressive model of unity order
is then ﬁtted (by standard least squares minimization) to data:

x(t) = A x(t − 1);

(1)

A is a 4 × 4 matrix, depending on τ , whose element Aij measure the causal inﬂuence of j − th time series on the i − th
one. Some of these matrix elements are found to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in patients and controls, as described in the
following.

3

Firstly we consider the interactions between heart rate and blood pressure. In physiological conditions heart rate
and arterial pressure are likely to aﬀect each other as a consequence of the simultaneous feedback baroreﬂex regulation
from sap-dap to rri and feedforward mechanical inﬂuence from rri to sap-dap [14].

In ﬁgure 6 the curves representing the causal relationship rri → sap are represented. Both in basal and paced
breathing conditions, this coeﬃcient is always negative and is stronger for controls. Two mechanisms determine
the feedforward inﬂuence rri → sap. Firstly the Starling law, stating that when the diastolic ﬁlling of the heart is
increased or decreased with a given volume, the volume of blood which is then ejected from the heart increases or
decreases by the same amount. More blood in: more blood out. This mechanism favors an increase of sap-dap as
the rri interval increases, i.e. a positive coeﬃcient rri → sap. The second mechanism is diastolic decay, described
by the Windkessel model of the capacitative property of arteries; as rri interval increases, this eﬀect tends to lower
sap-dap values and gives a negative contribution to the coeﬃcient rri → sap. Our ﬁnding suggests that the second
mechanism is dominant. The diﬀerence between patients and controls is signiﬁcant at low and intermediate τ , and
especially in basal conditions. The coeﬃcient rri → dap shows a behavior very similar to those of rri → sap, i.e. it
is always negative and is stronger for controls.

Evaluation of baroreﬂex regulation sap-dap → rri is an important clinical tool for diagnosis and prognosis in a
variety of cardiac diseases [15]. Recent studies, see e.g. [16] and references therein, have suggested that spontaneous
ﬂuctuations of arterial pressure and rri oﬀer a noninvasive method for assessing baroreﬂex sensitivity without use of
provocative tests employing injection of a vasoconstrictive drug or manipulation of carotid baroreceptor. In ﬁg. 7
we depict the interaction dap → rri as extracted by our approach, showing high discrimination between controls and
patients. In basal conditions this coeﬃcient is positive for controls and negative for patients. Moreover, this coeﬃcient
for patients is much inﬂuenced by respiration: in paced breathing conditions it is almost zero for patients, while being
positive for controls. It is worth stressing that the interaction dap → rri , evaluated by the present approach, has only
little relation with the baroreﬂex sensitivity index considered, e.g., in [16]; indeed the procedures for evaluating these
quantities diﬀer in several steps. For example in our approach all time series are centered and normalized, hence the
interaction between arterial pressure and rri is described only qualitatively.

Human respiration interacts with heart rate, originating the well known phenomenon of respiratory sinus arrhythmia
[17]. We ﬁnd that the interaction rri → ilv is signiﬁcantly (p < 10−4) stronger in controls than patients, under paced
breathing and using τ = 4. We also ﬁnd that the interaction ilv → rri is positive and signiﬁcantly (p < 10−5) stronger
in controls, in basal conditions and at high frequencies (τ ≤ 4).

Let us now turn to consider self interactions of time series. The matrix element A11 describes how much the rri
signal depends on its value at the previous time. As it is shown in ﬁgure 8, in basal conditions A11 is signiﬁcantly
lower for controls. In paced breathing conditions signiﬁcant diﬀerence is found at high τ . Also the self interaction
of dap time series gives rise to an interesting pattern. It is stronger for controls, especially at low τ , leading to high
discrimination between controls and patients at low τ as ﬁgure 9 shows.

The interaction of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure in healthy subjects has been recently studied in [18]. In
the present analysis we ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between patients and controls when the interaction sap→dap is
considered, see ﬁgure 10. For controls, this coeﬃcient is always negative and its strength increases with τ .

It is known that respiration interacts in an open loop way with arterial pressure, mainly through a mechanical
mechanism [19]. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm it; indeed we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant sap → ilv interaction, but signiﬁcant (p
< 10−3) diﬀerences between patients and controls are found when the interaction ilv→sap is considered: controls
show reduced interaction w.r.t. patients.

III. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we have presented the multiscale entropy analysis of short term physiological time series. We
have shown that the analysis of [8] can be successfully performed also on short rri recordings, still leading to separation
between controls and patients. Moreover we extend the analysis by considering simultaneously acquired recordings
of sap, dap and ilv. We have also proposed a multiscale approach to evaluate interactions between time series, by
performing a multivariate autoregressive modelling of the coarse grained time series. This analysis has put in evidence
interesting patterns of interactions between time series, while providing several new quantitative indicators which are
statistically correlated with the CHF pathology, and which can be employed for diagnosis of CHF patients. Separating
dead patients from alive patients is a very important task, since a good estimation of the probability of surviving of
a given patient would be valuable when a decision has to be made with respect to the therapy to be undertaken. The
separating performances provided by our indicators in this case are not good as those obtained separating patients
and controls. Further work must be done to deal with the separation between dead patients and alive patients; in
particular it will be interesting to repeat this analysis with longer recordings so as to take into account ﬂuctuations

in lower frequency bands.

FIG. 10: The strength of the interaction sap→dap, evaluated as described in the text, is plotted versus τ . Empty squares are
the averages over controls, full circles are the averages over patients, and empty circles are the averages over dead patients.
Top left: sap→dap in basal condition. Top right: the probability that basal values from controls and patients were drawn from
the same distribution, evaluated by non parametric test. Bottom left: sap→dap in paced breathing condition. Bottom right:
the probability that paced breathing values from controls and patients were drawn from the same distribution, evaluated by
non parametric test.

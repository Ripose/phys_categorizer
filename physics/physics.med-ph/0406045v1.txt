Abstract

Sequences based on the Distant Dipolar Field (DDF) have shown great promise for novel
spectroscopy and imaging. Unless spatial variation in the longitudinal magnetization, Mz(s),
is eliminated by relaxation, diffusion, or spoiling techniques by the end of a single repeti-
tion, unexpected results can be obtained due to spatial harmonics in the steady state MSS
z (s)
proﬁle. This is true even in a homogeneous single-component sample. We have developed
an analytical expression for the MSS
z (s) proﬁle that occurs in DDF sequences when smear-
ing by diffusion is negligible in the T R period. The expression has been veriﬁed by directly
imaging the MSS

z (s) proﬁle after establishing the steady state.

1 Introduction

NMR and MRI sequences utilizing the Distant Dipolar Field (DDF) have the rela-
tively unique property of preparing, utilizing, and leaving spatially-modulated lon-
gitudinal magnetization, Mz(s), where ˆs is in the direction of an applied gradient. In
fact this is fundamental to producing the novel “multiple spin echo”[1, 2] or “non-
linear stimulated echo” [3] of the classical picture and making the “intermolecular
multiple quantum coherence (iMQC)” [4] observable in the quantum picture.

and b are the same phase.

Existing analytical signal equations for DDF/iMQC sequences depend on Mz(s)
being sinusoidal during the signal build period[5, 6]. Experiments that probe sam-
ple structure also require a well-deﬁned “correlation distance” which is deﬁned as
the repetition distance of Mz(s) [7, 8, 9]. If the repetition time T R of the DDF se-
quence is such that full relaxation is not allowed to proceed T R < 5T1, or diffusion
does not average out the modulation, spatially-modulated longitudinal magnetiza-
tion will be left at the end of one iteration of the sequence. The next repetition of
the sequence will begin to establish “harmonics” in what is desired to be a purely
sinusoidal modulation pattern. Eventually a steady state is established, potentially
departing signiﬁcantly from a pure sinusoid.

2 Experimental Methods

In order to study the behavior of the steady state MSS
z (s) proﬁle we have imple-
mented a looped DDF preparation subsequence followed by a standard multiple-
phase encode imaging sub-sequence. (Figure 1.) The a pulse excites the system,
the gradient Gq twists the transverse magnetization into a helix. b
rotates one com-
ponent of the helix back into the longitudinal direction. For simplicity we have
omitted the 180◦ pulses used to create a spin echo during TM and/or TB sometimes
present in DDF sequences. Also, we are only interested in Mz(s) in this experi-
ment, not the actual DDF-generated transverse signal. Looping the “preparation”
sub-sequence thus creates the periodic Mz(s) proﬁle, spoils remaining transverse
magnetization, and establishes MSS
z (s) into transverse
magnetization, allowing it to be imaged via the subsequent spin echo “image”
sub-sequence. MSS
z (s) must be re-established by the “preparation” sub-sequence
for each phase encode. After a suitably long full relaxation delay “relax,” the se-
quence is repeated to acquire the next k-space line. This is clearly a slow acquisition

z (s). The e pulse converts MSS

method because many T R periods are required to reach steady state in the prepa-
ration before each k-space line is acquired. The sequence is intended as a tool to
directly image the MSS
z (s) proﬁle, verifying the MSS
z (s) that would occur in a steady
state DDF sequence, not as a new imaging modality.

3 Theory

The effect of the ”preparation” pulse sequence was ﬁrst determined for a single
iteration. The progress along the sequence is denoted by the the superscript.

Starting with fully relaxed equilibrium magnetization before the a pulse:

after the a pulse, the mix delay T M and the b pulse we have:

We now show in Figure 3 representative MSS
the sequence described in section 2 for four different values of T R = 5s, 2s, 1s, 500ms.
Figure 4 shows several cross sections through row #128 of Figure 3. The object
is an 18mm glass sphere ﬁlled with silicone oil. Data points are superimposed
with the corresponding magnitude of the theoretical curve. The T1 of the silicone
oil (at 400MHz) was measured by spectroscopic inversion recovery to be 1.4s. A
Bruker DRX400 Micro 2.5 system was used with a custom 27mm diameter 31P/1H
birdcage coil. 10 T R periods were used to establish steady state. A 10s “relax”
delay was used between phase encodes to establish full relaxation. Gq was 3ms
and 2.5mT/mm, with Gspoil1 of 5ms and 100mT/mm. No attempt was made to ac-
count for B1 inhomogeneity. A single scaling parameter was used for all theoretical
curves. We achieved good agreement with the theoretical predictions. In the se-
quence as used T M = T B = 7ms. A variety of other Gq directions and strengths
show similar agreement with theory. Better agreement in the ﬁt between experi-
ment and theory can be obtained with a = b = 75◦than with the nominal 90◦. A
B1 map needs to be determined to see if this corresponds more closely to the actual
experimental conditions.

5 Conclusions

The expressions developed and veriﬁed above should be useful to those wishing to
understand or utilize harmonics in the MSS
z (s) proﬁle in DDF based sequences in
the situation where the diffusion distance during T R compared with l
in negligible.
This is especially true for those carrying out structural measurements which depend
on a well deﬁned correlation distance. The theory should also hold for spatially
varying magnetization density M0 = M0(~r), and longitudinal relaxation T1 = T1(~r).

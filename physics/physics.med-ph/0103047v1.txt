Abstract

This work is an exposure assessment for a population living in
an area contaminated by use of depleted uranium (DU) weapons.
RESRAD 5.91 code is used to evaluate the average eﬀective dose
delivered from 1, 10, 20 cm depths of contaminated soil, in a resi-
dential farmer scenario. Critical pathway and group are identiﬁed in
soil inhalation or ingestion and children playing with the soil, respec-
tively. From available information on DU released on targeted sites,
both critical and average exposure can leave to toxicological hazards;
annual dose limit for population can be exceeded on short-term pe-
riod (years) for soil inhalation. As a consequence, in targeted sites
cleaning up must be planned on the basis of measured concentration,
when available, while special cautions have to be adopted altogether
to reduce unaware exposures, taking into account the amount of the
avertable dose.

1 Introduction

Munitions containing depleted uranium (DU) have been used by NATO and
US forces during the war operations in Iraq (1991), Bosnia (1994), Kosovo
and Serbia (1999). Recently some information on 112 sites targeted by DU
weapons in Kosovo has been supplied by NATO to the United Nation En-
vironmental Program Balkans Task Force (UNEP BTF); on November 2000
measurements to detect contamination have been undertaken by a UNEP
team in 11 among the 112 sites.

Aim of this paper is outlining some aspects of the exposure of people
living in an area contaminated by DU, on the basis of oﬃcial available infor-
mation and of simulations, looking for main pathways of average and critical
exposure.

Individuation of pathways of high exposure could allow to advice to popu-
lation; average dose assessment, together with measures of DU concentration
in soil, will make delimitation of areas to be cleaned up possible.

2 Military use of depleted uranium

The Gulf war against Iraq in 1991 was the ﬁrst one known where DU rounds
have been used in large quantity (approximately 300 tonnes) [1, 2]. The
consequences on the health of the Iraqi population and of the US veterans
are still under study. DU exposure at the moment is not considered the most
probable cause of the Gulf War Syndrome experienced by hundreds thousand
veterans [3]; on the other hand, the eﬀects of the DU left over the Iraqi
territory are diﬃcult to show, due to the large number of toxic substances
dispersed in the environment during the war and the deterioration of the
sanitary situation caused by the embargo to which the country is submitted
from 1991 (cited work in [4], app.3).

Reports on potential eﬀects on human health and environment from the
use of DU have appeared during the last years: studies on risk assessment
for the Jeﬀerson Proving Ground, a US facility for testing DU munitions,
have been performed [5]; the risk for population for the Kosovo conﬂict and
for the Gulf war has been also considered [4, 6].

DU can be obtained as by-product in the enrichment process of natural
uranium for the production of nuclear fuel and for military applications; as

2

the ore extracted natural uranium, DU is associated to a reduced chain of
radioactive isotopes, formed by 238U and 235U decay products having shorter
decay times: 234T h (24 days), 234mP a (1.17 min) and 234P a (6.7 hours), 231
Th(25.5 hours). DU can also be obtained by the reprocessing of nuclear
power plant spent fuel, and so traces of transuranic elements and 236U can
be present. According to oﬃcial information, DU used by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defence contains approximately 0.2% of 235U and traces of 234U,
236U. Following the indications in [7, 8], we will assume the uranium iso-
topic composition of DU given in Table 1. DU speciﬁc activity is in part due

to uranium isotopes (14.9 Bq/mg, 36%), and for the residual part to beta
emitting short-life decay products (64%); among the transuranic elements
oﬃcial information is available only for 239P u (2.4 104 years), whose content
is estimated in 11 ppb [9]. DU speciﬁc activity is not substantially aﬀected
by the declared amount of traces elements.

Metallic uranium has a high density (19 g/cm3), is pyrophoric and cheaper
than tungsten, and so has been attractive for U.S. Army for the production of
armor piercing ammunition since 1960s. Tungsten alloys have been preferred
up 1973, when a DU alloy with 0.75% of titanium (U-3/4Ti) was adopted for
ammunition made by a thin cylinder in DU alloy encased with lighter ma-
terial. Systems of DU weapons are owned or under development in diﬀerent
countries (Saudi Arabia, France, United Kingdom, Israel, Pakistan, Russia,
Thailand and Turkey) [8].

Use of DU ammunition causes exposure of people soon and after, because
DU is dispersed as aerosol when the projectile strikes a hard target and

3

then falls out on a limited area [7]. Contamination of all environmental
matrices takes place and health eﬀects on people living nearby must be taken
in account, both for toxicological damage and for radiological risk. Among
diﬀerent isotopes present in DU as declared, 238U,234U and 235U are of concern
in risk assessment. For chemical hazard, kidney is identiﬁed as the target
organ, whatever the path of assumption [10]. Due to prevalent short-range
emitted radiation, the risk associated with exposure to ionizing radiation
mainly derives from ingestion and inhalation of radioactive material; external
irradiation from soil is less relevant.

3 Dispersion of DU in the environment and

exposure of the population

DU contained in projectiles, spread out as aerosol in air after striking the tar-
get, falls out producing environmental and food chain contamination. Possi-
ble occurring of chemical hazard and entity of radiation dose must be assessed
for people living in the area, taking into account both average and critical
group exposure.

DU concentration in the soil is the starting point; while waiting for mea-
surements of contamination in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia, we present
computed radiation doses and associated concentrations for diﬀerent con-
taminated soil thickness, as soil mixing will extend the initial superﬁcial
deposition to underlying layers in not undisturbed areas. Available soil mea-
sured DU concentrations in contaminated sites that we are aware of, are the
following:

• at Jeﬀerson Proving Ground area an average P U concentration of 318
Bq/kg was reported [11]; more recently a lower and an upper bound
of the concentration ranging from 592 Bq/kg to 13690 Bq/kg was also
measured [5];

• among the areas where the US personnel lived in the Gulf region (out-
side Iraq) the highest DU concentration (433 Bq/kg) was measured in
the Iraqi Tank Yard (the area where captured Iraqi equipment is stored
in Kuwait) [12];

4

• in some sample analyzed by the RFY scientists a speciﬁc activity of

238U up to 2.35 105 Bq/kg was detected [13].

Following the hypothesis assumed in the BTF report, we have assumed as
a reference value a DU contamination of 1000 Bq/kg of soil over an area of
A = 10000 m2, in the hypothesis of 10 kg of DU entirely dispersed in the
impact as aerosol of uranium oxides, contaminating 1 cm of soil. With the
composition given in Table 1 initial activities per kg of soil for 238U, 235U,
234U and 236U are respectively 830 Bq, 11 Bq, 154 Bq and 5 Bq.

Average eﬀective dose is conservatively assessed using the residential
farmer scenario. The following pathways are considered: external irradia-
tion from soil, inhalation from resuspended dust, ingestion of contaminated
soil and water, ingestion of plants and animal products grown in site and
ingestion of ﬁsh grown in a pond contaminated by groundwater. Diﬀerent
pathways are considered for plant contamination due to ﬁrst root uptake (wa-
ter independent) and due to secondary root uptake from use of contaminated
water (water dependent). Radon inhalation is excluded. RESRAD 5.91 [14]
code is used, all parameters default except for the ones given in Table 2. Es-
timates of dose to individuals and population for risk in contaminated sites
have been performed by EPA employing primarily the code RESRAD (for
related work see [15, 16]).

RESRAD default libraries values have been corrected to give eﬀective dose
[17] rather than equivalent eﬀective dose [18]: due to the algorithm used by
RESRAD, anyway, values for external irradiation EG in Tables 4 and 5 have
been impossible to modify, and are approximate by 10% maximum defect.

In Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 we show average annual eﬀective doses and corre-
sponding DU concentrations in water and vegetables for three diﬀerent soil
thickness, respectively 1 cm, 10 cm and 20 cm. The following quantities are
given at diﬀerent times, from the ﬁrst year to about two hundred years after
maximum dose, for main pathways: the total dose (Etot), the dose from exter-
nal irradiation from the soil (EG), from inhalation of contaminated dust (EI),
from consumption of edible plants (water independent EP , water dependent
Ew

P ) and of water (EH2O).

The dependence of tmax and Emax on some hydrogeological parameters,
mainly aﬀecting the water dependent pathways, is shown in Table 7 and
8. The maximum value of the dose is not much aﬀected by most of the
parameters considered in Table 8 except Kd. This parameter is deﬁned as

the ratio of the mass of solute species observed in the solids per unit of dry
mass of the soil to the solute concentration in the liquids. A wide range has
been observed for uranium Kd values [19]. For largest value of Kd the DU is
retained in surface and does not reach at least within the ﬁrst 1000 years the
watertable. A measurement of the local value of this parameter is therefore
necessary to reduce the uncertainty on the dose assessment.

Strong dependence of maximum inhalation dose has been found, as ex-

pected, on the dust loading parameter, as shown in Table 9.

As already outlined, presented doses and concentrations have been ob-
tained from an average value of soil contamination, in order to assess the
average exposure of population. Whatever the average value considered,
anyway, highly inhomogeneous soil concentrations must be expected in the
contaminated area, both for sparse aerosol deposition and for oxidation of
DU fragments: concentrations up to 12% in weight have been reported [20].
In order to assess the dose to critical population group, this must be taken in
account, especially if inhalation of soil was the critical pathway: inhalation
of 0.1 g of soil with maximum reported DU contamination, equal to 12 mg
DU, corresponds to 1.44 mSv; ingestion of 1 g of soil, equal to 120 mg DU,
corresponds to 0.08 mSv.

A scenario, in which permanence in dusting air and ingestion of soil are
possible, is the one for children playing with soil. From the presented dose
assessment and considerations children playing with soil may be identiﬁed as
the critical population group, with inhalation and/or ingestion of contami-
nated soil as critical pathway. Evidently, average and critical doses are some-
how competitive, because the higher fraction of DU is dispersed as aerosol,
the lower part of it can rest in soil as fragment, being presence of fragments

the main cause of hot spots in soil contamination.

It must be outlined that the amount of DU considered in the simulation
corresponds to 37 A-10 /GAU-8 ammunitions. According to the available
information, a much larger number of projectiles has been ﬁred on each site
(between 50 and 2320, average 300) and up to now unknown is the extension
of targeted sites. Both for average and critical exposure, anyway, more realis-
tic dose assessment will be possible only when measured contamination data
will be known, scaling the values in the tables for the appropriate factor.

Increment of inhalation dose attributable to 239P u presence in DU is
oﬃcially estimated in 14% [9]: with 11 ppb of 239P u in DU RESRAD gives
a maximum dose increment of 0.6%.

4 Normative and recommendations framework

Before discussing compliance of average assessed doses and exposure with
international standards set to prevent from toxicological damage and limit
ionizing radiation risk, we shortly line out an aspect relative to radioprotec-
tion system, maybe useful even in wider considerations on risk.

Due to accepted linear-no-threshold model for eﬀects produced by ioniz-
ing radiation, justiﬁcation of a practise has to be the ﬁrst one posed, that is
if the population exposure from military use of DU is justiﬁed or not. Com-
parison between dose estimates in such a scenario and dose limits and dose
constraints stated by regulations is anyway useful, for a quantitative per-
ception of risk. In order to assess the need for remediation in contaminated
areas, once again the question of justiﬁcation has to be considered; speciﬁc
reference levels, linked to the avertable annual dose, have to be deﬁned by
national authorities. ”Generic reference levels ... should be used with great
caution” and their use ”should not prevent protective actions from being
taken to reduce ... dominant components [of existing annual dose]” [21]. We
next report a comment to assessed doses, comparing them with radiological
and toxicological reference values, in order not to hold the question narrowed
to exceeding of dose limits.

Values of annual dose in Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the same temporal shape,
with an initial prevalent dose from irradiation by soil and a maximum from
ingestion of contaminated drinking water occurring after about ﬁve hundreds
years, when contamination reaches the acquifer serving the population. Max-
imum dose, progressively increasing as inventary of DU increases, is always
lower than annual population limit (1 mSv/y), starts to be comparable with

dose constraint of 0.1 mSv/y indicated in [21] for longlived isotopes may not
be excluded. This in general happen only after long times, due to the low
mobility of the uranium oxides (the mean transit times for insoluble uranium
in the top 10 cm of soil range from 7.4 to 15.4 years with an average of 13.4
years [23]; soluble forms have a mean transit times of one month). At the
maximum dose time concentration of DU in the water reaches the provisional
value of WHO guideline for drinkable water (0.05 Bq/l [24]) already for 1
cm depth. The concentration of DU in leafy vegetables at time of maximum
dose ranges from 2 to 4 Bq/kg; no derived limit is deﬁned for consumption
of dietary parts.

Inhalation of highly contaminated soil may leave to exceeding of annual
dose limit, with possible occurring of toxicological damage: maximum al-
lowed concentration in air for workplaces stated by NRC, 45 µg/m3 for sol-
uble and 200 µg/m3 for insoluble uranium forms, would be exceeded if dust
loading was more than 1700 µg/m3, a high but not extreme value. Less im-
portant seems ingestion of contaminated soil, due to the lower value of dose
conversion factor with respect to the inhalation one. Anyway, ingestion of 1
g maximum contaminated soil would result in 120 mg DU ingestion, when
maximum daily ingestion of uranium, due to toxicological eﬀects, was stated
in 150 mg by italian legislation till year 2000.

5 Conclusions

DU contained in projectiles, spread out in air after striking the target, falls
out producing environmental and food chain contamination. Possible occur-
ring of chemical hazard and entity of radiation dose must be assessed for
diﬀerent kind of exposure of people living in the area, taking into account
both average and critical group exposure. While waiting for measurements
of contamination in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia, we have computed ra-
diation doses and concentrations for diﬀerent contaminated soil thickness, as
soil mixing will extend the initial superﬁcial deposition to underlying layers
in not undisturbed areas.

In order to assess the average exposure of population, doses and con-
centrations have been obtained from an average value of soil contamination.
For the individuation of the critical group inhomogeneous soil concentration
has been considered. The presented dose assessment suggests a short term
exposure due to inhalation and/or ingestion of contaminated soil and a long
term exposure due to ingestion of contaminated water and food; the propa-
gation of the superﬁcial contamination to the watertable critically depends
on various hydrogeological parameters to be evaluated on the site.

In sites targeted by DU munitions special cautions have to be adopted to
reduce unaware exposures and cleanup must be planned on the basis of the
measured concentrations.

Monte Carlo calculations using the codes PENELOPE and GEANT4 have been performed to
characterize the dosimetric parameters of the new 20 mm long catheter based 32P beta source
manufactured by Guidant Corporation. The dose distribution along the transverse axis and the two
dimensional dose rate table have been calculated. Also, the dose rate at the reference point, the radial
dose function and the anisotropy function were evaluated according to the adapted TG-60 formalism
for cylindrical sources. PENELOPE and GEANT4 codes were ﬁrst veriﬁed against previous results
corresponding to the old 27 mm Guidant 32P beta source. The dose rate at the reference point
−1, for
for the unsheathed 27 mm source in water was calculated to be 0.215 ± 0.001 cGy s
PENELOPE, and 0.2312 ± 0.0008 cGy s−1 mCi−1, for GEANT4. For the unsheathed 20 mm source
these values were 0.2908 ± 0.0009 cGy s−1 mCi−1 and 0.311 ± 0.001 cGy s−1 mCi−1, respectively.
Also, a comparison with the limited data available on this new source is shown. We found non
negligible diﬀerences between the results obtained with PENELOPE and GEANT4.

INTRODUCTION

One of the major limitations of coronary interventions lies in the appearance of restenosis of the treated vessel.
Restenosis occurs in 35%-40% of the treated patients in case of angioplasty, whilst the percentage reduces to 22%-32%
in case coronary stents are used [1].

Intravascular brachytherapy appears to be a useful tool to solve such problems [2]. PREVENT [3] and INHIBIT
[4] studies have pointed out the ability of ionizing radiation to inhibit restenosis. Though either gamma and beta
radiation have been used, endovascular beta-radiotherapy has become most popular in Europe due to the obvious
radiation safety advantages.

This new, rapidly growing interest has led both the AAPM [5] and the ESTRO [6] to report recommendations on the
medical physic issues. At the minimum standard level, dose at the prescription point in the central plane is encouraged
to be recorded and reported. Additional dose calculations in peripheral planes require complete two-dimensional (2D)
dosimetry information. However, beta sources present a high dose gradient, the distances in which the dose is deposited
being considerably small. This has made it diﬃcult to perform adequate dosimetry on intravascular sources.

Recently, the dosimetric characterization of a 27 mm long, catheter based, 32P beta source wire, manufactured by
Guidant Corporation (Houston, Texas, USA), has been done by means of plastic scintillator [7] and radiochromic ﬁlm
[7, 8].

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have proved to be a valuable complementary means for determining the dose
distributions around beta emitters. The 32P source mentioned above has been simulated with diﬀerent MC codes
(MCNPv4B2 [7]-[10], CYLTRAN/ITS3 [7, 11], MCNPv4C [7], EGS4 [9, 12, 13] and EGSnrc [12]) and the calculated
doses agree within < 10% with the experimental results.

In this work we address the 2D dosimetric characterization of a new, clinically used, 20 mm long catheter based
32P beta source wire, commercially available in the GalileoTM Intravascular Radiotherapy System, manufactured also
by Guidant Corporation. This source has been used [14] in a detailed study in which a variety of MC codes are
intercompared. Also a comparison with measurements done by using radiochromic-dye ﬁlm and an extrapolation
chamber is carried out. Measured and calculated values were found to agree within 10% in a polystyrene phantom.
On the other hand, the calculated depth dose curves, using the MC codes, were within 5% at 4 mm depth, after an

adequate selection of the tracking parameters. In this last case water was considered the medium surrounding the
source.

Here we have used the MC codes PENELOPE [15] and GEANT4 [16]. PENELOPE was designed speciﬁcally
to account for the transport of low-energy electrons, photons and positrons and has been used to simulate other
brachytherapy sources [17, 18]. GEANT4 includes special packages which permit to describe low energy physics
processes and, at present, it is being used to simulate diﬀerent situations of medical physics interest [16]. In this work
we have determined the dose rate at the reference point, the depth dose and the two dimensional dose distribution.
We also calculated the radial dose and the anisotropy functions, as proposed in the adapted AAPM TG-60 formalism
for cylindrical sources [19], used also in Ref. [12]. We compare some of our results with those quoted in Ref. [11].

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS

A. Source models

A schematic view of the geometry of the two sources analyzed is shown in Fig. 1. The 27 mm source has been
described in Refs. [7, 8]. The geometry of the 20 mm source has been obtained from Ref. [11] and corresponds closely
to that quoted in [14]. The active cores are cylinders with length of 27 and 20 mm, respectively. These cores are
made of C2H6O2. The 20 mm source presents a 0.019 mm thick source carrier wrapping the active core. This is made
of polymide. The cores are encapsulated by NiTi tubes with thickness of 0.076 mm in both sources. In the 27 mm
source, a tungsten X-ray marker of 1 mm in length follows the core at the distal end. In the case of the 20 mm source,
two markers of the same characteristics are located at both the distal and the proximal ends of the active core. Both
sources include a NiTi plug of 1 mm in length following the distal tungsten X-ray marker. A NiTi hemispherical seal
is welded at the distal end and an unbound NiTi wire is attached to the proximal end in both sources. Empty regions
between the diﬀerent pieces and the capsules are supposed to be ﬁlled with air.

Sources are centered inside a catheter of Nylon-12. In some of the calculations done for the 27 mm source, we have
considered a helicoidal catheter (labeled catheter 1) reported in Refs. [7]-[12]. In the case of the 20 mm source, we
have calculated using both this helicoidal catheter and a lobed catheter (labeled catheter 2) currently in use. This
catheter is a new design to increase the blood ﬂow during the procedure. Both catheters were modeled as tubes with
an external radius of 0.4445 mm, while the inner diameter was 0.597 mm for catheter 1 and 0.5716 mm for catheter
2. Gaps between catheters and sources are assumed to be ﬁlled with air.

Catheter and source were placed in a water phantom the dimensions of which are large enough to ensure no

signiﬁcant loss of radiation.

The composition and density considered in the simulation for the diﬀerent materials is given in Table I.

source. For the 27 mm source a density of 1.12 g cm

−3 has been used.

B. Monte Carlo calculations

In this work the PENELOPE [15] and GEANT4 [16] Monte Carlo codes have been used to perform the simulations.
PENELOPE is a general purpose MC code which allows to simulate the coupled electron-photon transport. It can be
applied to energies ranging from a few hundred eV up to 1 GeV and with arbitrary materials. Besides, PENELOPE
permits a good description of the particle transport at interfaces and presents an accurate description of the electron
transport at low energies. These characteristics make PENELOPE a useful tool for medical physics applications as
previous works have pointed out (see e.g. Refs. [17, 18]). We have used the version 2001 of the code. Details about
the physical processes included can be found in Ref. [15].

GEANT4 is a toolkit aiming to simulate the passage of particles through matter for applications in high energy
physics, nuclear experiments, medical physics studies, etc. Due to its purpose, the available energy range and the
possible particles to be simulated are much larger than for PENELOPE. GEANT4 includes low energy packages which
extend the energy range of particle interactions for electrons, positrons and photons down to 250 eV, and can be used
up to approximately 100 GeV. In this work we have used the version 4.1 with the patch-01 and the low energy package
G4EMLOW1.1. Detailed documentation concerning the physics involved can be found in Ref. [16].

As the sources considered here present cylindrical symmetry, a cylindrical coordinate system was used with the
origin in the center of the active core and with the z axis along the source and pointing to its distal end. The dose
distributions were supposed to be functions of the axial coordinate z and the radial coordinate ρ. The position of the
reference point is (ρ0 = 2 mm, z0 = 0).

The radionuclide was assumed to be uniformly distributed inside the active core. The direction of the emitted
electrons was supposed to be isotropic around the initial position. The initial electron energies were sampled from the
[20]. A calculated average energy of 0.6957 MeV was obtained,
corresponding Fermi distributions, taken from Ref.
in agreement with values reported in previous works [8, 21].

In PENELOPE analog simulation is performed for photons. For electrons, instead, the simulation is done in a mixed
scheme in which collisions characterized by a scattering angle larger than a certain value are called hard collisions
and are individually simulated, while collisions with a scattering angle smaller that the limit value are called soft
collisions and are described by means of a multiple scattering theory. The electron tracking is controlled by means of
four parameters. C1 and C2 refer to elastic collisions. C1 gives the average angular deﬂection due to a elastic hard
collision and to the soft collisions previous to it. C2 represents the maximum value permitted for the average fractional
energy loss in a step. On the other hand, Wcc and Wcr are energy cutoﬀs to distinguish hard and soft events. Thus,

4

the inelastic electron collisions with energy loss W < Wcc and the emission of Bremsstrahlung photons with energy
W < Wcr are considered in the simulation as soft interactions. In our calculations the simulation parameters were
ﬁxed to the following values: Wcc = 5 keV, Wcr = 1 keV, C1 = C2 = 0.05, smax = 1035. This last parameter is an
upper bound for the length of the steps generated in the simulation.

Photons were simulated down to 1 keV. Primary electrons, δ rays and positrons were absorbed when they slow
down to kinetic energies of 1 keV, in air, and 50 keV, in all the remaining materials, except in the active core where
the cut oﬀ energy was ﬁxed to 200 keV. This value takes care of the fact that electrons with such an energy are
not expected to leave the active core. Those betas generated with energies below the simulation threshold were not
transported and their energy was deposited at the source position.

In case of GEANT4 simulations, it is necessary to choose a given range threshold for each particle type. This
threshold is converted, internally, to an energy threshold below which secondary particles are not emitted. In our
calculations the range thresholds have been ﬁxed to 100 nm providing energy thresholds of 1 keV for both photons
and electrons in all materials considered.

The statistical uncertainties were calculated by scoring both the energy deposited in each voxel and its square for
each history. These voxels were taken to be annular bins with thicknesses ∆ρ = 0.1 mm and ∆z = 0.2 mm. The
average energy deposited in a given voxel (per incident particle) is

where N is the number of simulated histories and ei is the energy deposited by all the particles of the i-th history
(that is, including the primary particle and all the secondaries it generates). The statistical uncertainty is given by

The uncertainties given throughout the paper correspond to 1σ. In tables, and in order to simplify the writing, they
are given between parentheses; for example, a value quoted as 0.956(2) means 0.956 ± 0.002.

In case of the 27 mm source, the simulations have been done by following 2 × 107 histories for PENELOPE and
5 × 107 for GEANT4. For the 20 mm source a total of 5 × 107 histories were simulated with both codes. These
numbers permitted to keep the statistical uncertainties under reasonable levels.

Additionally, we performed, for the 20 mm source, simulations with PENELOPE by using scoring voxels given by
cylindrical annuli of ∆z = 13 mm centered along the source axial direction, and ∆ρ = 0.1 mm in the radial direction.
A total of 6 × 107 histories were followed in this case. These scoring voxels warranty radial distributions which are
eﬀectively constant over the axial length and permit the uncertainty to be reduced considerably.

III. RESULTS

A. 27 mm source

First we validated the MC codes with the old 27 mm source. Our results were compared with those reported in

literature.

In Refs. [7] and [8] the MCNPv4B2 code was used. Mourtada et al. [7] transported 106 histories in each run, with
scoring voxels given by cylindrical annuli of 20 mm in the source axial direction and 0.1 mm in the radial direction.
They showed also the dose rate per unit activity along the transverse axis. The same code and voxels were used by
Bohm et al. [8] for the dose rate per unit activity along the transverse axis. Besides, these authors calculated the dose
to water, away and along the source, using thin cylindrical shells with a thickness of 0.1 mm and a height of 0.1 mm
as scoring voxels. Wang and Li [12] used scoring voxels equal to those we have considered here. Finally, Seltzer [11]
quoted the results obtained for a simulation with CYLTRAN/ITS3, but did not give information about the scoring
voxels.

The dose rate at the reference point for the unsheathed 27 mm source in water was calculated to be 0.215 ± 0.001
and 0.2312 ± 0.0008 cGy s−1 mCi−1 for PENELOPE and GEANT4, respectively, thus diﬀering by 7%. These
values must be compared with the results obtained with the other codes. The calculation with EGSnrc [12] provides
0.2185 ± 0.0002 cGy s−1 mCi−1. Mourtada et al. [7] obtained 0.229 cGy s−1 mCi−1 by means of MCNPv4B2. Finally,
in Ref. [8] a value of 0.232 ± 0.00028 cGy s−1 mCi−1 was found also with MCNPv4B2. This is the largest value found,
which diﬀers from the one we have obtained with PENELOPE (the smallest one) by ∼ 8%.

TABLE II: Two-dimensional dose rates (in cGy s−1 mCi−1) for the 27 mm source sheathed by catheter 1. The errors corre-
sponding to the calculations performed with MCNPv4B2 (Ref.
[12]) are
[11] and therefore are
quoted to be below 1%. The CYLTRAN/ITS3 data have been obtained by scanning Fig. 11 of Ref.
indicative only.

[8]) as well as those with EGSnrc and EGS4 (Ref.

In Table II we compare the dose rate per unit activity along the transverse axis (values for z = 0 in the ﬁrst set
of rows) obtained with PENELOPE and GEANT4 with those of Refs. [8, 11, 12]. The results correspond to the 32P
wire source sheathed by catheter 1. As we can see PENELOPE produces results very similar to those of EGSnrc.
In this case the diﬀerences for any ρ value are below 6% with respect to the dose rate obtained with PENELOPE
˙DPEN(ρ0, z0). Up to ρ = 3 mm PENELOPE practically coincides with EGS4, the diﬀerences
at the reference point,
relative to ˙DPEN(ρ0, z0) being smaller than 5%. The diﬀerence between GEANT4 (MCNPv4B2) and PENELOPE
is below 8% (5%), relative to ˙DPEN(ρ0, z0). In what respect to the results of CYLTRAN/ITS3, they show negligible
diﬀerences with PENELOPE results. The fact that these last quoted values have been obtained by scanning Figure
11 of Ref. [11] makes these diﬀerences to be only indicative.

Two-dimensional dose distributions are shown in Tables II and III for some values of ρ and z ≥ 0. Similar results
are obtained for the negative values of z, though the source wire is not symmetric with respect to z = 0. In Table II
our results are compared with those of Bohm et al. [8] calculated with MCNPv4B2 for the source sheathed by catheter
1. In Table III the dose distributions for the unsheathed source, normalized to the reference point, are compared with
the results obtained by Wang and Li [12] using EGSnrc.

The diﬀerences between MCNPv4B2 and PENELOPE (see Table II), remain below 5%, relative to ˙DPEN(ρ0, z0)).

Same situation appears for MCNPv4B2 and GEANT4, which give very similar results for ρ ≤ 2 mm.

Table III shows that EGSnrc and PENELOPE provide very similar normalized doses. It is important to remember
here that the diﬀerence in the doses at the reference point between both codes is 1.6% only. The diﬀerences maintain
at more or less the same level for all z and ρ values studied.

Finally, and as we can see in both tables, the discrepancies between PENELOPE and GEANT4, observed for the
dose rate per unit activity along the transverse axis, show up again. In any case the diﬀerences remain below 8% with
respect to ˙DPEN(ρ0, z0).

TABLE III: Two-dimensional dose rates for the unsheathed 27 mm source. The values are normalized to the dose rate at the
reference point (ρ0 = 2 mm, z0 = 0). The errors corresponding to the calculations performed with EGSnrc (Ref.
[12]) are
quoted to be below 1%.

B. 20 mm source

1. Unsheathed source

Once we have analyzed the results obtained for the 27 mm source, we will discuss the dose rates found for the
20 mm source. All the results here correspond to the unsheathed source. For clarity, we leave the analysis of the
sheathed source for the next subsection.

In Table IV (box labeled z = 0) we show the results we have obtained for the dose rate per unit activity along
the transverse axis. The ﬁrst row gives the results obtained using PENELOPE for voxels with ∆z = 13 mm. The
second (third) rows correspond to the results obtained with PENELOPE (GEANT4) for voxels with ∆z = 0.2 mm.
The dose rates at the reference point calculated with PENELOPE are 0.2918 ± 0.0001 cGy s−1 mCi−1 when the large
scoring voxel (that with ∆z = 13 mm) is used and 0.2908 ± 0.0009 cGy s−1 mCi−1 for the small one (that with
∆z = 0.2 mm). GEANT4 produces a value of 0.311 ± 0.001 cGy s−1 mCi−1, which diﬀers from the previous ones in
∼ 7%. On the other hand, the discrepancy between the results obtained with both codes increases with increasing ρ,
showing a behavior similar to that found for the 27 mm source.

at −z. The results are similar in both codes. As we can see, the ratio of the dose rates does not show statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences from unity, even at large z. This means that the asymmetry of the source structure due to the
small diﬀerences between the distal and the proximal ends is smaller than statistical uncertainties and would therefore
probably be irrelevant in practice.

In Fig. 5 we analyze the axial dose uniformity by plotting the ratio of the dose at z = 3 up to 8 mm to the dose
at z = 0 as a function of ρ. The results show that, for a given ρ value, doses stay constant for axial positions up
to 6-7 mm. This occurs for both PENELOPE and GEANT4 and means that the scoring voxels with ∆z = 13 mm,
considered above to reduce the uncertainty in calculating the radial dose, can be used safely for that purpose.

The two-dimensional dose rates we have obtained using voxels with ∆z = 0.2 mm are listed in Table IV. For each
z value, the ﬁrst row corresponds to PENELOPE and the second one to GEANT4. The values for z < 0 are not
included because of the symmetry with respect to the corresponding z > 0 results. On the other hand, the uniformity

up to z ∼ 6 mm is again evident. The comparison between both codes indicates that GEANT4 predicts larger doses
than PENELOPE except for ρ below 0.5 mm.

To ﬁnish with the analysis of the unsheathed source, we calculated the radial dose functions and the anisotropy
functions. Following Ref. [19], these quantities are given in the cylindrical coordinate system instead of the spherical
one used in the TG-60 formalism [5]. For the radial dose we have

FIG. 6: Comparison between the anisotropy functions for the unsheathed 20 mm source obtained with PENELOPE (squares)
and GEANT4 (curves). The errors for GEANT4 results are of the same order than those obtained with PENELOPE.

The anisotropy function is given by

F (ρ, z) =

˙D(ρ, z)
˙D(ρ, z0)

G(ρ, z0)
G(ρ, z)

,

where G(ρ, z) = β/(Lρ), with L = 27 or 20 mm, according to the source considered, and β is the angle between the
lines joining the point (ρ,z) and the two extremes of L.

Calculated radial dose functions for PENELOPE and GEANT4 in water are shown in Table V. As we can see, the
discrepancies observed between both codes in previous results are evident here again. Besides, we have included the
results obtained with PENELOPE for the 27 mm source and those quoted by Wang and Li for EGSnrc [12]. The
radial dose function for the 20 mm source appears to be rather similar to that of the 27 mm source. The results
obtained with PENELOPE diﬀers less than 10% up to ρ = 6 mm. Finally, PENELOPE and EGSnrc provide results
which coincide within the statistical uncertainties for the 27 mm source.

Table VI shows the anisotropy function calculated for the unsheathed 20 mm source with PENELOPE. These
results are compared in Fig. 6 with those obtained with GEANT4. As in previous comparisons, the discrepancies
between both codes appear to be noticeable for large ρ and/or z values, though the absolute diﬀerences remain small
in comparison with the values obtained at the reference point.

2. Sheathed source

Here we analyze the eﬀect of the catheter on the dosimetry. First we compare the results we have obtained with both
codes with the scarce data available in the literature. Table VII shows this comparison with the data provided by the
manufacturer in the source manual (second column) and with the results of a set of calculations with diﬀerent codes
performed by Seltzer [11]. In these calculations the scoring voxels were taken to be annuli of radial thickness 0.1 mm
and axial length 15 mm, centered along the active wire length. This produces greatly reduced statistical uncertainties.
As can be seen, our results for PENELOPE coincide with those found with CYLTRAN/ITS3 and PENELOPE in
Ref. [11], except for small deviations (less than 1%) at ρ = 2 mm in the last case. The values provided by Guidant
are between 5 and 10% above those we have found for PENELOPE. MCNP4C results are similar to the Guidant ones
and those calculated with EGS4 and EGSnrc fall to ∼ 7% below those obtained with PENELOPE at ρ = 4 mm. The
values found with GEANT4 follow the same trend seen in the previous sections.

between the depth doses calculated with and without catheter for PENELOPE (squares) and GEANT4 (disks). The
results corresponding to the 20 mm source are shown. As we can see, both codes produce similar results with both
catheters. However, GEANT4 shows an increase of the eﬀect of the catheter above ρ = 3.5 mm which is not present
in the PENELOPE calculation. Similar results are obtained for the 27 mm source sheathed by catheter 1. On the
other hand, catheter 2 produces a modiﬁcation of the dose in water slightly smaller than catheter 1. This last gives
rise to enhancements of the dose rate on the transverse axis reaching ∼ 4% above ρ = 3 mm, whilst the ﬁrst one
increases the dose rate by ∼ 2.5% at most. This result is reasonable if one considers that catheter 2 has a smaller
inner radius than catheter 1, thus reducing the air gap. In any case, uncertainties in source strength measurements

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have performed the dosimetric characterization of two wire sources of 32P (of 27 mm and 20 mm
active length) manufactured by Guidant Corporation and clinically used in intravascular brachytherapy. To do so we
have used the Monte Carlo codes PENELOPE and GEANT4.

First we have validated the codes by comparing the results obtained with these two codes with those available in
the literature for the 27 mm source. The main conclusion is that PENELOPE produces dose rates in reasonable
agreement with those quoted in Ref. [12] for EGSnrc and EGS4 except in the tails of the axial doses (large z values).
Calculations performed with MCNPv4B2 [7, 8] diﬀer from those obtained with PENELOPE as the distance to the
source increases. The comparison between PENELOPE and GEANT4 shows a clear disagreement.

For the 20 mm source, we have calculated the depth doses on the transverse axis, the two-dimensional dose rate
table and the radial dose and anisotropy functions (this two last according to the approach proposed in Ref.
[19]
for cylindrical sources). We have checked that the dose distribution remains uniform along the axial direction for
|z| smaller than 6-7 mm and ρ ∼ 7 mm. Besides, we have tested the symmetry of the dose distribution. The dose
rates calculated with PENELOPE show a good agreement with the scarce data available, while those obtained with
GEANT4 follow a trend similar to that observed in the 27 mm source.

The presence of the catheter sheathing the sources produces an increase in the dose rate on the transverse axis.
This enhancement is larger for the helicoidal catheter (catheter 1) than for the lobed one (catheter 2). For the ﬁrst
one, the dose on the transverse axis increases up to 4% above ρ = 3 mm, while the second one produces a maximum
enhancement of ∼ 2.5%. These diﬀerences could produce non-negligible modiﬁcations in the clinical use of the sources.
The results we have obtained indicate that PENELOPE produces a dose rate map which can be considered to rep-
resent the dosimetric characterization of the sources here studied. The appreciable discrepancies shown by GEANT4
results need a deeper investigation in order to clarify the origin of these diﬀerences. In particular, to determine if
they are due to the physics included in the simulations or to the tracking procedure should be of great interest. We
are working in this direction.

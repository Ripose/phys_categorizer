We investigate phase synchronization in EEG recordings from migraine patients. We use the
analytic signal technique, based on the Hilbert transform, and ﬁnd that migraine brains are char-
acterized by enhanced alpha band phase synchronization in presence of visual stimuli. Our ﬁndings
show that migraine patients have an overactive regulatory mechanism that renders them more sen-
sitive to external stimuli.

Phase synchronization was introduced for coupled
chaotic systems by Rosenblum et al.
[1] and has been
conﬁrmed experimentally [2]. This concept, introduced
in the ﬁeld of nonlinear dynamics, provides a measure
of synchronization alternative to conventional linear ap-
proaches. It may be useful for biological time series, in
particular to the study of electroencephalographic (EEG)
signals, where synchronization phenomena are expected
to play a major role for establishing the communication
between diﬀerent regions of the brain [3].

Migraine is an incapacitating disorder of neurovascular
origin, which consists of attacks of headache, accompa-
nied by autonomic and possibly neurological symptoms.
It is estimated that in the USA, 5% of the general pop-
ulation suﬀer at least 18 days of migraine a year, and
more than 1% have at least one day of migraine a week
In spite of a lot of research, there are still many

There is a tendency to believe that migraine starts with
an underlying central nervous system disorder, which,

when triggered by various stimuli, sets oﬀ a chain of
neurologic and biochemical events, some of which sub-
sequently aﬀect the brain’s vascular system. No experi-
mental model fully explains the migraine process [5]. A
wide range of events and conditions can alter conditions
in the brain that bring on nerve excitation and trigger mi-
graines. They include emotional stress, intense physical
exertion, abrupt weather changes, ﬂickering lights, and
many others. The question we address here is: how does
the response of migraine patients to such events diﬀers
from those of healthy persons? To address this problem,
we investigate synchronization phenomena in Electroen-
cephalograms (EEGs) recorded from migraine patients in
presence of repetitive visual stimuli (steady-state visual
evoked potentials, SVEPs [6]), and study how synchro-
nization between diﬀerent brain regions varies in presence
of external stimuli (i.e., while brain is processing exter-
nal information). We ﬁnd that migraine brains show in-
creased alpha band phase synchronization, while healthy
persons show a decreased one. Our results suggest that
migraine patients have an overactive regulatory mecha-

m
m
nism, prone to instability, which renders them more sen-
sitive to environmental factors.

Our data are as follows. EEG is recorded from ﬁfteen
patients aﬀected by migraine without aura [7], in pres-
ence of visual stimuli. During the acquisition, ﬂash stim-
uli are presented to the subjects repetitively at a rate of
3-6-9-12-15-18-21-24-27 Hz. The mean age of patients is
38.7 years (range 24-48 years). Each frequency of stimu-
lation is delivered by a ﬂash settled at a luminance of 0.2
joules for at least 20 seconds; an interval of 20 seconds
is interposed between the diﬀerent trains of stimulation.
EEG data are recorded by 18 scalp electrodes, placed ac-
cording to the International 10-20 system, referred to CZ
derivation.
Impedance is settled below 5 KΩ, EEG is
digitally ﬁltered oﬀ line by means of a digital ﬁlter with
a band-pass of 0.3-30 Hz; the sampling rate is 128 Hz.
Examples of EEG signals are shown in ﬁg. 1; also sponta-
neous EEG (i.e. in the absence of stimuli) is recorded for
all patients, see ﬁg. 2. All patients are in the inter-ictal
state, the time from the end of the last attack being at
least 72 hours. Moreover, EEG data from ﬁfteen healthy
subjects (ages ranging from 22 to 45 years) are measured
so as to have a control group.

We recall how to detect n : m phase synchronization
in noisy scalar signals [8]. Based on general theorems on
analytical functions the following relation holds

Im ζ(t) =

This equation is known as the Hilbert transform and
it is used to form, starting from a signal s(t) = Reζ(t),
the analytic signal ζ(t) = A(t)eiφ(t), where A(t) =
s2(t) + ˜s2(t), and ˜s(t) = Imζ(t). To control the pos-
p
sible synchronization of two signals s1(t), s2(t) the fol-
lowing procedure is applied: the instantaneous phases
φ1(t) and φ2(t) are computed and the so called general-
ized phase diﬀerences

Φn,m(t) = [mφ1(t) − nφ2(t)]mod2π ,

with n, m integers, are evaluated [9]. Phase synchroniza-
tion is characterized by the appearance of peaks in the
distribution of Φn,m and quantiﬁed by comparing the ac-
tual distribution with a uniform one in the following way.
The n : m synchronization index of s1 and s2 is deﬁned
as ρn,m = [Smax − Sn,m]/Smax, where Sn,m is the Shan-
non entropy of the distribution of Φn,m and Smax is the
entropy of the uniform distribution; in the case at hand
only 1 : 1 synchronization leads to interesting results.

Let us now turn to describe our ﬁndings. The EEG
signals are ﬁltered in the alpha band (8-12.5 Hz) [10]
and the synchronization index above described is eval-
uated for all pairs of electrodes, for all thirty subjects
and for all frequencies of the ﬂash stimuli. These indexes
are subsequently averaged over all the possible pairs of
sensors, for each subject both in presence of stimuli and
in spontaneous conditions. These mean values do not
separate patients from healthy subjects; what emerges

FIG. 3: (a) The FDR method (see the note [13]) is applied to
select the stimuli frequencies separating patients and controls
according to Γ values. The vertical axis represent the prob-
ability that the thirty Γ values of patients and controls were
drawn from the same distribution, according to the paired t-
test. Frequencies 9-24-27 Hz are selected with false positive
rate 0.05. (b) The probability that the thirty Γ values of pa-
tients and controls were drawn from the same distribution is

The FDR method is applied to select separating electrodes,
for 9 Hz ﬂash stimuli. The vertical axis represent the prob-
ability that the thirty Γs values of patients and controls, for
each sensor s, were drawn from the same distribution, accord-
ing to the paired t-test. Eleven electrodes, out of eighteen,
are selected. The labels for electrodes correspond to Inter-
national 10-20 system. (d) As in (c) for 24 Hz ﬂash stimuli.
Thirteen electrodes are selected.

1,1/ρsp

1,1, where ρf

as correlated with the migraine pathology is the ratio
γ = ρf
1,1 is the mean phase synchroniza-
tion in presence of ﬂash stimuli, whereas ρsp
1,1 is the mean
spontaneous phase synchronization. This ratio measures
how phase synchronization varies, in the presence of the
stimuli, with respect to basal conditions, i.e. the neat ef-
fect of the stimulus. Our supervised analysis (hypothesis
testing) shows that the index Γ = ln (γ) [11] separates
the class of patients and the class of controls for stimulus
frequencies of 9,24,27 Hz. For each of the 9 ﬂash stimuli
frequencies ω, we apply the paired t-test to evaluate the
probability Pω that indexes Γs were drawn from the same
distribution (the null hypothesis); in seven cases out of
nine this probability is less than 0.05, the standard value
used in literature to reject the null hypothesis. How-
ever, here we deal with multiple comparisons. To control
the number of false positives, we use the false discov-

ery rate (FDR) method [12]. This procedure [13] selects
the stimuli frequencies 9-24-27 Hz as separating patients
from controls (see ﬁg.3a), with the expected fraction of
false positive 0.05. The same frequencies (9-24-27 Hz)
are selected by use of the standard Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons [14] as well as by FDR if prob-
abilities are evaluated by the non-parametric Wilcoxon
rank sum test (see ﬁg.3b).

tograms of Φ1,1, corresponding to electrodes T3 and T5,
are shown for a migraine patient and for a control, both
under stimulation and spontaneously. The distribution,
when stimuli are delivered, broadens for the healthy per-
son while becoming more peaked for the patient. This
behavior is further illustrated in ﬁg.6, where the time
evolution of the phase diﬀerence between two sensors is
depicted for a migraine patient, both subject to stim-
uli and in spontaneous conditions. In presence of ﬂash
phase locking, in the two signals, is observed for time seg-
ments several seconds long; no such locking is observed
in the spontaneous case. Phase diﬀerence curves, for a
control, are drawn in ﬁg.7. It is worth stressing that this
phenomenon is not mined if coherence is used to measure
synchronization: considering the linear index obtained by
integration of the coherence function (normalized ampli-
tude of the cross spectrum of the two time series [18]) in
the alpha band, the corresponding Γ and Γs quantities do
not lead to separation between patients and controls for
any frequency of stimulation. We show that migraineurs
are characterized by alpha band hyper-synchronization
in presence of visual stimuli. We also show how this
varies with the frequency of the ﬂash, and present a to-
pographic analysis where separating electrodes are rec-
ognized. Whilst it is comprehensible that 9 Hz stimuli
might cause hyper-synchronization in the alpha band (8-
12.5 Hz), in order to ﬁgure how 24-27 Hz stimuli may act
on alpha oscillations we observe that brain is a nonlinear
system, and sub-harmonics of 24-27 Hz fall in the alpha
band: stimulation in the 24-27 band may cause hyper-
synchronization through their sub-harmonics. However
a similar behavior is not observed for other frequencies
with sub-harmonics in the alpha band, like 18 Hz: fur-
ther investigation is needed to clarify this aspect of the
phenomenon. It will be also interesting to investigate the

patients and over controls) is represented for all the eighteen
electrodes. On the average, phase synchronization increases
for patients and decreases for controls.

1,1is/hρsp

A topographic analysis is also performed,

in order
to check whether this phenomenon is localized in some
cortex region. We evaluate, for each sensor s, Γs =
ln(hρf
1,1is), where h·is means averaging only over
the pairs where s is one the two sensors. For each
frequency of stimuli, we apply FDR method to select,
among the eighteen electrodes, those separating patients
from controls according to their Γs [15]. The results are
depicted in Figures 3c (9 Hz case) and 3d (24 Hz): eleven
electrodes are recognized as separating in the case of 9
Hz stimuli and thirteen in the case of 24 Hz; no electrode
is found to be individually separating when 27 Hz stimuli
are considered. Since separating electrodes from all the
regions of the cortex (frontal, parietal, central, temporal
and occipital) are found, it follows that the phenomenon
here described is extended over all the cortex, not being
localized in a limited region. Its diﬀuse nature suggests
that genuine spatial synchronization [16] is here involved;
indeed, volume conduction eﬀects [17] would induce spa-
tially more localized change.
Our data show that,

for patients, the mean phase
synchronization increases in presence of visual stimuli,
whereas it decreases in controls. For example, in the
case of 24 Hz stimuli, and for all the sensors, the mean
value (over subjects) of Γs is shown in ﬁg. 4: hyper phase
synchronization is observed in patients, whereas healthy
subjects show a reduced phase synchronization. Similar
patterns occur for 9 and 27 Hz stimuli. In ﬁg. 5 the his-

consistent with current theories about the role of subcor-
tical structures in migraine. Since brainstem is active in
migraine [19], it has been proposed, as a unifying concept
of migraine, that brainstem regions concerned with neu-
ral mechanism of synchrony are dysfunctional [20]. Cor-

[6] Previous works on SVEPs focused on the spectral ampli-
tude, at each electrode, of the signal at the same funda-
mental frequency as the driving stimulus. See, e.g., R.B.

[7] There are two types of migraine, with and without aura.
Aura is deﬁned as symptoms of the nervous system
(usually visual) that precede a migraine and are usu-
ally followed by the headache within one hour. See, e.g.,
Headache Classiﬁcation Committee of the International
Headache Society, Cephalalgia 8, 1 (1988).

[9] In case of shorter stimuli, convolution with a wavelet may
have some advantages over Hilbert transforming:
see,
e.g., M. Le Van Quyen et al., J. Neurosci. Meth. 111,
83 (2001).

[10] Alpha rhythms are associated with quiet wakefulness
with eyes closed. Both ﬁltering the signals in the other
physiological bands (beta,
theta, etc.) and ﬁltering
around the fundamental frequency of the luminous stim-
uli, do not lead to signiﬁcative diﬀerences in the measures
of synchronization of patients and healthy subjects.
[11] We consider ln (γ) instead of γ because the distribution
of ln (γ) values is found to be Gaussian, thus justifying
use of t-test.

tex, in migraine brains, is thus misled by a dysfunctional
gating system; normal light is unpleasant, normal sound
uncomfortable and, probably, normal pulsing of vessels
felt as pain. On the mathematical side, our results con-
ﬁrm the usefulness of the analytic signal technique to
study physiological time series.

[13] FDR works in the following way: the N = 9 frequencies
are ordered according to their increasing Pω values, and a
parameter q, which controls the fraction of false positive,
is set to 0.05. The index j is identiﬁed as the largest
such that for all i ≤ j we have Pωi ≤ i
c(N) , c(N )
N
being a constant described below. The null hypothesis is
rejected for those frequencies whose index i is such that
i ≤ j. The choice of the constant c(N ) depends on the
assumptions about the joint distribution of the P-values
corresponding to diﬀerent frequencies: c(N ) is set to 1
under the assumptions of independence of the measures
at diﬀerent frequencies, and this choice we make in the
present case.

q

[14] The Bonferroni correction consists in lowering the thresh-

old from 0.05 to 0.05/N , in the case of N comparisons.

[15] In the case of correlated P-values the value c(N ) =
N
i=1 1/i is to be used in FDR. Since P-values from elec-
trodes are not strictly independent, we adopt, in this
P
case, this choice with N = 18.

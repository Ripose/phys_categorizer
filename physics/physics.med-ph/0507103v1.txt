ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Any undertaking as arduous as obtaining one’s doctor of philosophy requires the help,

support, and understanding of many people.

I wish ﬁrst of all to thank my adviser Arthur F. Gmitro, whose willingness to take on a

student wanting to study a new, exciting, and somewhat obscure area of magnetic resonance

has lead to this work. Without his early risk taking, conﬁdence, continued support, and

direction this work would never have been accomplished. I’d also like to acknowledge his

excellent teaching, and his part in introducing me to the ﬁeld of Magnetic Resonance.

Thanks to my committee members Professors Harrison H. Barrett, Theodore P. Trouard,

and Jean-Phillipe Galons.

First I’d like to thank Harry for his support early in my graduate work at the University

of Arizona, his excellent teaching for all his courses on imaging science and mathematics,

and the privilege to read early drafts of his recent book “Foundations of Image Science”.

Ted deserves thanks for his generosity in all things, personal, professional, and for

letting me have a desk in his lab...

I cannot thank J. P. enough for all his help in learning about NMR and MRI, the research

game, and the dreaded Bruker programming environment....

Constantin Job deserves thanks putting up with all the ups and downs associated with

hardware support in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Facility.

There are numerous others to thank for numerous reasons, and not enough space to do

so properly here.

5

I dedicate this dissertation to my wife Katrina and our daughter Marianna.

Thanks for all your love and support! And for putting up with a husband and dad in grad

school...

ABSTRACT

Distant dipolar ﬁeld (DDF)-based nuclear magnetic resonance is an active research area

with many fundamental properties still not well understood. Already several intriguing

applications have developed, like HOMOGENIZED and IDEAL spectroscopy, that allow

high resolution spectra to be obtained in inhomogeneous ﬁelds, such as in-vivo. The the-

oretical and experimental research in this thesis concentrates on the fundamental signal

properties of DDF-based sequences in the presence of relaxation (T1 and T2) and diffusion.

A general introduction to magnetic resonance phenomenon is followed by a more in depth

introduction to the DDF and its effects. A novel analytical signal equation has been devel-

oped to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and diffusing spatially modulated longitudinal

spins during the signal build period of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak. Diffusion of the

longitudinal spins results in a lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time,

delaying the re-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture. In the classical

picture the unwinding rate of spatially twisted magnetization is no longer constant, but de-

cays exponentially with time. The expression is experimentally veriﬁed for the HOMOG-

ENIZED spectrum of 100mM TSP in H2O at 4.7T. Equations have also been developed

for the case of multiple repetition steady state 1d and 2d spectroscopic sequences with in-

complete magnetization recovery, leading to spatially varying longitudinal magnetization.

Experimental veriﬁcation has been accomplished by imaging the proﬁle. The equations

should be found generally applicable for those interested in DDF-based spectroscopy and

imaging.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Motivation and Setting

Distant dipolar ﬁeld (DDF) based nuclear magnetic resonance is a relatively new area of

research. It utilizes what had been thought of as the negligible interaction between macro-

scopic groups of spins in a liquid. This is in contrast to microscopic interactions which

contribute to relaxation effects.

The macroscopic or “distant” dipolar ﬁeld now becomes a new tool, added to the al-

ready overﬂowing toolbox of physical and physiological effects utilized in magnetic reso-

nance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MRI). It offers many exciting possibilities such

novel contrast imaging, motion insensitivity [1], and mesoscale (below the size of single

voxel) spatial frequency selectivity.

One of the most intriguing features, at least for in-vivo spectroscopy, is insensitivity to

B0 inhomogeneity. This was demonstrated by Warren et al. in the HOMOGENIZED 2d

spectroscopy sequence [2].

The work presented in this thesis was motivated by trying to apply HOMOGENIZED to

an NMR compatible bioreactor system [3]. This system has practical limits for line-widths

obtainable in localized spectroscopy, which HOMOGENIZED could potentially overcome.

19

As the work progressed it became obvious that there were still fundamental issues not well

understood for HOMOGENIZED and DDF in general. The work then shifted to under-

standing such fundamental issues as signal dependence on T1, T2, and diffusion, as well as

the fundamental nature and spatial origin of the signal.

1.2 Prehistory of NMR

Semantics and the lens of hindsight make any historical and even scientiﬁc historical fact

open to interpretation. The ﬁeld of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is generally said to

originate with the announcement by I. I. Rabi et al.[4, 5] of a new “resonant” technique for

measuring the magnetic moment of nuclei in a molecular beam passing through a magnetic

ﬁeld. This became quickly established as a powerful technique for the measurement of

magnetic properties of nuclei. Subsequently E. Purcell et al.[6] looked at resonant absorp-

tion of radio-frequency energy in protons in semi-solid parafﬁn. Nearly simultaneously F.

Bloch et al.[7] reported resonant ”induction” in liquid water. These successes were pre-

ceded by earlier efforts in the Netherlands and in Russia[8]. The importance of NMR was

highlighted by the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Physics to Rabi in 1944, and to Bloch

and Purcell in 1952.

The infant technique of NMR in liquids and solids quickly established itself as a use-

ful probe of numerous physical properties of nuclei, atoms and molecules in solution and

solids. Over the years it has developed from a technique of experimental physics to one

of experimental chemistry, to a routine analytical tool in chemistry and to some degree

solid state physics and materials science. It then branched into radiology/medical imag-

ing as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI, originally called nuclear magnetic resonance

imaging, the unpopular term “nuclear” being dropped).

NUCLEAR MAGNETISM

2.1 The NMR Phenomenon

The matter that surrounds us is composed of atoms and molecules, arranged as atomic or

molecular gas mixtures (the atmosphere), liquid mixtures or solutions (the ocean, lakes,

tap water, gasoline, urine), liquid crystals, solids (rocks, metals, glasses, etc.), plasmas

(consisting of partly or wholly ionized atoms and molecules) and more complicated sus-

pensions, composites, and living systems. All atoms in all these states of matter contain a

nucleus and some of these nuclei (those with an odd number of protons or neutrons) pos-

sess a net spin and a magnetic moment [9, section 1.3.3, pp 12-15]. The magnitude of the

proton and other nuclear magnetic moments has been measured to great accuracy thanks to

the resonant atomic beam experiments of Rabi et al. [5] and followers. The origin of the

nuclear spin and magnetic moment is the domain of subatomic physics, speciﬁcally quan-

tum chromodynamics, and is still an active theoretical [10] and experimental [11] research

topic.

2.2 Susceptibility and Magnetization

A material has macroscopic magnetic properties determined by its magnetic susceptibility

(see reference [12] and appendix A.1). The “DC” susceptibility χ determines the equilib-

rium magnetization of a sample when placed in an external ﬁeld. It is a classical dimen-

sionless quantity that represents the average tendency of the individual magnetic dipole

moments to align due to a magnetic ﬁeld. It is a function of sample composition, phase

(gas, liquid, solid, plasma), and temperature (see appendix A.1). The total “DC” sus-

ceptibility can be broken up into two components, electronic and nuclear. The electronic

χ is in general a tensor quantity, and can be nonlinear (saturation for ferromagnetic ma-

terials) and include history effects. For water and many (but not all) biological materials, χ

can be considered a constant scalar quantity, in which case the direction of net magnetiza-

tion is parallel to the ﬁeld. µ0 is the “permeability of free space” needed for the SI system

We can break up the magnetization into two components, electronic and nuclear, based

on the susceptibility component that gives rise to the magnetization. We can further break

up the nuclear component into contributions from different types of nuclei. We write this

The main effect of electronic magnetization in NMR is to cause inhomogeneous broad-

(see section 4.4). We will drop the “n” from M0n from now on and use M0 to denote the

equilibrium nuclear magnetization, and χ to denote nuclear susceptibility.

2.3 Precession

It is a well established fact that a magnetic dipole with moment perturbed from alignment

with an external magnetic ﬁeld will precess (Figure 2.1). This is the underlying physical

basis for NMR. Precession is due to the torque ~µ

~B0 acting on the non-zero angular

×

momentum of the nucleus [14, eq (7)]. The rate of precession is determined by the mag-

netogyric ratio (often called the gyromagnetic ratio), denoted by γ. This is the ratio (for a

given nucleus) of magnetic moment to (spin) angular momentum, where ~~I is the angular

momentum of the nucleus. We write the magnetic moment in terms of γ as

γ ~ ~I.

We note that when non-zero, the change in ~M , d ~M

The solution to equation 2.7 is best carried out in spherical coordinates, with ~B0 ori-

ﬁgure 2.1 the sense of rotation is left handed or clockwise about ˆz. This is because most

nuclei of interest have a positive magnetogyric ratio1 , γ > 0, although some nuclei posses

γ < 0.

In Cartesian coordinates the solution becomes

~M (t) = M0[sin(θ0) cos(φ0 + ω0t) ˆx + sin(θ0) sin(φ0 + ω0t) ˆy + cos(θ0) ˆz],

(2.9)

where M0, θ0 and φ0 determine the initial magnitude and orientation of ~M.

2.4 Longitudinal and Transverse Components

It is helpful to distinguish between longitudinal and transverse components of the magneti-

zation (Figure 2.2). The longitudinal (oriented

to ~B0) component does not precess, while

the transverse (oriented

to ~B0) does precess. The longitudinal and transverse compo-

nents of magnetization relax differently. We will discuss relaxation properties in chapter 4.

Distinguishing between the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetization

will also be useful later when we discuss the distant dipolar ﬁeld in Part II. The components

are deﬁned as

~M = ~Mk + ~M⊥,

~Mk ≡

M0 cos(θ0) ˆz,

(2.11)

(2.12)

and

~M⊥ ≡

M0[sin(θ0) cos(ω0t + φ0) ˆx + sin(θ0) sin(ω0t + φ0) ˆy].

(2.13)

We can introduce an even further convenience, denoting the ˆx component as the real

part and the ˆy component as the imaginary part of a complex scalar value, written as

~M⊥ ≡

Re(M⊥) ˆx + Im(M⊥) ˆy.

(2.14)

26

Figure 2.3: Rotating frame, ω0 < 0 and t > 0.

This gives us the form

M⊥(t) = M0sin(θ0) ei (ω0t+φ0).

(2.15)

Note that ω0 < 0 corresponds to clockwise or left-handed precession about ˆz for nuclei

with γ > 0.

The longitudinal magnetization is always real and can be written as a real scalar

Mk = M0 cos(θ0).

2.5 Rotating Frame

Another helpful concept is the rotating frame [16]. We construct another Cartesian coordi-

nate system, whose z′ axis coincides with the laboratory frame z. The x′ and y′ axis rotates

with angular frequency ω. We show this in ﬁgure 2.3. In the rotating frame, if ω = ω0, the

magnetization will appear to stand still. The coordinate transformations are

OSCILLATING FIELD EFFECTS

Chapter 3

3.1 RF Field

The “resonance” in NMR and MRI refers to the response of nuclei to an applied oscillating

magnetic ﬁeld, called an “RF ﬁeld” or “RF pulse”. For commonly achievable ﬁelds and

nuclei the Larmor frequency falls within the 1-1000MHz frequency range, hence the term

Radio Frequency or RF.

In general, the magnetic (and electric) ﬁeld properties in an NMR experiment depend on

the speciﬁc geometry of the RF coil, and sometimes the geometry and absorption properties

of the sample. We will consider an idealized case of uniform RF ﬁelds and no absorption.

The term “B1 inhomogeneity” refers to the situation where the RF coil produces more RF

magnetic ﬁeld at one location than another. Some coils are designed with a homogeneous

RF ﬁeld in mind, such a solenoids or birdcages [17, 18, 19]. Others such as surface coils

are not, and may require B1 insensitive “adiabatic” pulses [20] for experiments sensitive to

B1 inhomogeneity.

We represent an applied RF magnetic ﬁeld by its components. The magnetic ﬁeld BRF

at the center of a current loop (called the transmit coil) carrying an alternating current I

is perpendicular to the axis of the loop as in ﬁgure 3.1. We must break the ﬁeld BRF into

its counter-rotating components. The nucleus will only respond to a ﬁeld rotating with the

same sense and angular frequency near its own Larmor frequency1. Mathematically we

(3.6)

The component B′

1 will in general have negligible effect on the system and can be

ignored. Some coils produce a rotating ﬁeld rather than a linear oscillating ﬁeld, in which

case no B′

1 component is produced. An advantage of these coils is efﬁciency of utilization

of RF power from the transmitter. In general the RF ﬁeld amplitude A is a function of time.

The RF ﬁeld can be turned on for periods of time, hence the term RF pulse.

An RF ﬁeld with ω1 = ω has a particularly simple representation in the rotating frame:

it is a constant ﬁeld that does not move. One can then add this ~B1 component to make a
total ~Bef f in the rotating frame. If ω1 6
is ~B1) will rotate with angular frequency ∆ω1 = ω1 −

and φ1 = π

2 corresponding to B1 initially oriented along ˆy′. If the RF resonance offset

∆ω1 = 0, then ~Bef f is constant in the rotating frame.

3.2 RF Pulse

Radio Frequency (RF) pulses are the principal workhorses of NMR and MRI. Magnetiza-

tion precesses about the effective ﬁeld ~Bef f in the rotating frame. For ∆ω1 = 0, ~Bef f = ~B1

and lies in the transverse plane. Turning on or off, or varying the amplitude B1 of the RF

ﬁeld by applying an “RF Pulse” is the principal activity in any NMR experiment.

3.2.1 90◦ Pulse

the z axis into the transverse plane such that γ B1τ = π

(3.8)

which allows for the amplitude of B1 and hence the precession rate of ~M about the B1

ﬁeld to vary in time. A 90◦ RF pulse acting on equilibrium magnetization is often called an

excitation pulse.

3.2.2 180◦ Pulse

A 180◦ pulse inverts the magnetization from its equilibrium value. It has twice the “area,”

as deﬁned in equation 3.8, as a 90◦ pulse. A 180◦ pulse acting on equilibrium magnetization

is often called an inversion pulse.

34

Figure 3.5: Same 180◦ RF Pulse as ﬁgure 3.4, but off-resonance.

3.2.3 Off-Resonance Pulse

In the prior examples we have assumed that the RF ﬁeld B1 is on resonance. If this is not

true Bef f will not lie in the transverse plane. The effect of an off-resonance B1 ﬁeld is

almost always to reduce the total rotation angle compared to one on-resonance for a given

pulse. This can be seen as follows. We will assume the same constant magnitude of B1

ﬁeld and duration as in ﬁgure 3.4. A pulse with constant B1 is also known as a “hard

pulse”. On-resonance the pulse is a 180◦pulse. Consider γ B1

2π = 500Hz. This form is a

convenient measure of B1 amplitude and is often shortened to B1 = 500Hz. In this case

for a 180◦pulse we need τ = 1ms. If the nuclei of interest are 500Hz off resonance we

have the following situation seen in ﬁgure 3.5. The pulse gives less than 90◦ of rotation,

and has a phase offset as well.

35

Figure 3.6: Hard pulse envelope, duration is 1ms.

3.6. The bandwidth is approximately 1200Hz.

36

Figure 3.8: Detecting precessing magnetization by induced current in receiver coil.

3.3 Pulse Bandwidth

The “bandwidth” of the pulse is deﬁned as the total frequency range for which the rotation

angle is above half the on-resonance value. In section 3.2.3 the pulse has a bandwidth of

about 1200Hz or 1.2kHz. Bandwidth in inversely proportional to τ and depends on the

shape of the pulse.

To ﬁnd the bandwidth of a pulse (see ﬁgure 3.6) one needs to solve the Bloch equations

for the speciﬁc pulse shape for a number of resonance offsets. One can also perform an

experiment to determine the performance of the pulse for excitation (or inversion), this is

called the excitation (or inversion) proﬁle. The Fourier transform of the RF pulse envelope

(see ﬁgure 3.7) gives a good approximation to the excitation proﬁle. The excitation proﬁle

shows the relative rotation angle achieved versus the resonance offset. The approximate

pulse bandwidth is the full-width-half-max of this approximate excitation proﬁle.

37

3.4 Free Induction Decay

Following a 90◦ pulse, the magnetization is entirely in the transverse plane, and continues

to precess in the transverse plane in the laboratory frame (since the RF ﬁeld is zero after

the pulse). In the rotating frame the magnetization will precess according to its resonance

offset ∆ω0.

The magnetic ﬁeld associated with the precessing magnetization can be detected by its

ability to induce a current in a nearby placed coil, called the receiver coil. The transmit

and receiver coils can be the same or different. The current induced in the receiver coil is

ampliﬁed, mixed with a local oscillator down to the audio frequency range, and digitized.

One can equate the local oscillator frequency of the receiver with the frequency of

rotation of the rotating frame. The output of the mixer will then oscillate at the frequency

of the resonance offset. Shown in ﬁgure 3.9 is an example oscilloscope trace from an early

pulsed NMR experiment.

The signal is called the “Free Induction Decay” or FID. The “Decay” comes from

relaxation processes, which we will discuss in section 4.

3.4.1 Quadrature Detection

Note that there will be an ambiguity as to the sign of the offset ∆ω0 unless more information

is obtained. This is achieved by quadrature detection. The idea is to get information about

both the real and imaginary components of the precessing magnetization. This can be

done in several ways. Originally it was done in an analog manner by having two reference

oscillators (or on oscillator and a phase shifter) and demodulating two signals, the phase of

one shifted by 90◦ with respect to the other [23, 24, sec. 6.4]. In digital systems it can be

done in a number of ways by oversampling and digital signal processing.

scope. From reference [22], Copyright 1950 by The American Physical Society, used with
permission.

3.4.2 NMR Spectrum

The complex Fourier transform of the FID yields the NMR Spectrum [25, 26]. See ﬁgure

3.10 for a simple simulated example. For the real part of the spectrum to be Lorentzian it

is often necessary to phase correct the spectrum [27, 28, sec. 5.1]. Originally NMR spectra

were not obtained in this way, rather the RF frequency (or B0 ﬁeld strength at constant RF

frequency) was swept across the range of interest. These so-called Absorption/Induction

methods have been shown to yield equivalent information to the Fourier method [29], how-

ever the Fourier method has many signal-to-noise and speed of measurement advantages

and is almost universally used in modern NMR spectrometers. The principal activity in

NMR spectroscopy is the identiﬁcation of peaks of differing chemical shifts (see section

4.4). Many other parameters can also be measured such as relaxation rates (chapter 4) and

diffusion (chapter 7).

RELAXATION

Relaxation is the name given to processes in which magnetization decays or returns to

equilibrium. There are two principal processes of interest, still named by their original

designations and symbols [30].

4.1 Longitudinal Relaxation, T1

Longitudinal relaxation, also called spin-lattice relaxation, using symbol T1, describes the

time scale at which magnetization returns to thermal equilibrium, M0, after being perturbed

away from equilibrium, such as by an RF pulse. Its effects are described by the following

equation for the recovery of the longitudinal magnetization

Mk(t) = M0 −

(M0 −

Mkinitial) e−t/T1,

which is the solution to the differential equation

T1. This can

also be seen in Figure 4.1.

41

Figure 4.1: Recovery of inverted magnetization by T1 relaxation as described by equation
4.3. T1 = 1 unit.

The term spin-lattice relaxation refers to transfer of energy from the nuclear spins com-

posing the macroscopic magnetization to the “lattice,” a catch-all term referring to all other

possible energy levels in the system. The details of spin-lattice relaxation are beyond the

scope of this dissertation. Sufﬁce it to say that in liquids, the main mechanism of lon-

gitudinal relaxation is RF ﬁelds from nearby spins causing stimulated transitions so that

equilibrium is attained. Spontaneous emission processes at NMR frequencies are entirely

negligible [31]. Information can be found in references [30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 9].

4.1.1 Repetition and Recovery

In many NMR and MRI experiments the system is re-exited before full relaxation (before

waiting 5

T1) has occurred. Often this is to speed up the total time necessary to make an

×

image in MRI or to acquire a 2d NMR spectrum. The time between multiple excitations is

called the “repetition time” and denoted by T R. There is an optimum RF excitation pulse

to maximize the signal given a speciﬁc T R and T1 which is called the Ernst angle [38, p.

155]. To ﬁnd the Ernst angle we ﬁnd the steady state longitudinal magnetization after a

4.2 Transverse Relaxation, T2

Transverse relaxation refers to the decay of transverse magnetization with time. It is called

spin-spin relaxation and is designated by the symbol T2. Phenomenologically it can be

described by the equation

M⊥(t) = M⊥initial e−t/T2

(4.8)

in which the initial transverse magnetization decays exponentially with time. This is the

solution to the differential equation

dM⊥
dt

−

(4.9)

Figure 4.3 shows the T2 decay curve where T2 is one time unit in magnitude.

The term spin-spin relaxation originates from the mechanism whereby the ﬁeld from

other nuclei and nearby molecules, atoms, or ions is a random function of time, and causes

a slight change in phase of a given nuclear moment’s precession. These random phase

variations accumulate over time, causing a reduction in the net macroscopic transverse

magnetization.

The details of transverse relaxation mechanisms are beyond the scope of this disserta-

tion; the reader is referred to references [30, 32, 34, 39, 35, 36, 9].

4.3 Field Inhomogeneity, T †2 and T ∗2

There is another decay process analogous to transverse T2 relaxation. It is due to variations

in the local magnetic ﬁeld, but over macroscopic distances and in a temporally determin-

istic (temporally non-random) manner. Variation in the applied ﬁeld B0 is usually called

“B0 inhomogeneity” while susceptibility induced variations go by the name “sample inho-

mogeneity” or “susceptibility gradients.”

The accumulated random phase variations are assumed to cause an exponential decay

The transverse magnetization will then be described by the equation

exponential terms [13], [40, sec. 20.4.1 pp. 602-603].

(4.11)

45

We will talk about B0 and sample inhomogeneity more in section 9.

4.4 Chemical Shift

In addition to the applied ﬁeld, ﬁeld inhomogeneity, and susceptibility ﬁelds, each nuclear

spin experiences a “local ﬁeld.” This is due to the ﬁeld of electrons and nuclei in the rest

of the molecule containing it, and ﬁelds from nearby molecules. This ﬁeld is constantly

changing due to translational, vibrational, and rotational motion. It is the ﬂuctuating com-

ponent of this local ﬁeld that leads to relaxation [30]. The time average component leads

to a shift in the Larmor frequency, called the chemical shift [41].

There are two components of the shift, a dominant ﬁeld proportional shift (due to dia-

magnetic effects), and another usually smaller absolute shift due to “J-coupling” through

bonds to other paramagnetic nuclei in the molecule [42, 43, 44].

The ﬁeld proportionality constant of the ﬁeld dependent chemical shift is often denoted

by the symbol σ, and can be thought of as the normalized resonance offset relative to a

“reference” Larmor frequency ω. This is written

ω0 −
ω

ω

.

σ

≡

(4.12)

σ is dimensionless and is almost always reported in units of 10−6 or “parts per million”

(ppm).

The chemical shift gives information about local chemical bond geometry and average

motion. It is the principal parameter of interest for determining chemical structure using

modern NMR spectroscopy [45]. A more detailed discussion of the origin of chemical shift

can be found in [9, section 7.7].

46

Chapter 5

SPIN-ECHO

The spin-echo is another key concept of NMR and MRI. First demonstrated by E. L. Hahn

[41], spin-echoes continue to be utilized in many NMR and MRI experiments. The spin-

echo is a way of refocusing (or re-phasing) the effects of temporally static ﬁeld inhomo-

geneities (see section 4.3).

A spin-echo consists of a 90◦ pulse to excite transverse magnetization followed by a

180◦ pulse, shown in ﬁgure 5.1. The effect of the 180◦ pulse is to invert the phase of the

transverse magnetization. Any phase acquired due to ﬁeld inhomogeneities or gradients

(see section 6) during the T E/2 time period before the 180◦ pulse is canceled by the phase

acquired during the T E/2 time period after the 180◦ pulse.

The envelope of a spin-echo free induction decay (FID) (not counting off resonance

oscillation, such as chemical shift) is

M⊥(t) = M⊥initiale−t/T2e−|t−T E|/T †
2 .

(5.1)

T E is called the echo-time. Note that the build (before T E

2 ) and decay (after T E

2 ) sides of

the FID are not symmetric in the presence of T2 decay.

It is possible to use multiple 180◦ pulses (spaced T E apart) and refocus multiple echoes.

This is sometimes called a CP sequence after Carr and Purcell [46], who originally used

47

Figure 5.1: Spin-echo pulse sequence.

such a sequence to examine the effects of diffusion (see section 7) and T2 relaxation. Mod-

iﬁcation of the phase of the RF pulses (where the inversion pulses are shifted by 90◦ in

phase) is called CPMG sequence, from Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill [47]. A CPMG se-

quence has the desirable property of being less sensitive to pulse amplitude errors than a

CP sequence, especially for the even echoes. This latter property is sometimes called “even

echo re-phasing.”

48

Chapter 6

GRADIENTS

Magnetic ﬁeld gradients are a useful tool in NMR spectroscopy for destroying unwanted

signals and introducing diffusion weighting (see chapter 7). Gradients are required for

MRI.

A gradient is produced by a secondary set of magnetic coils, designed so that the ﬁeld

varies linearly with position along the direction of the gradient [48]. An x gradient ﬁeld

can be represented by the equation

∆ ~B(x) = Gxx ˆz.

(6.1)

Note that the direction of the gradient refers to the direction along which the gradient

strength varies, not the direction of the ﬁeld. MRI instruments usually possess three gradi-

ent coils, to produce orthogonal x, y, and z gradients. These can be linearly combined into

an arbitrary gradient direction ˆs.

Applying a gradient causes the magnetization to twist into a helix along the direction

of the gradient. The longer the gradient is applied, the more twisted the transverse magne-

tization becomes. The resulting NMR signal, when the magnetization is in a twisted state,

is greatly reduced when there are many twists across the sample. This is sometimes called

“crushing” or “spoiling” the transverse magnetization.

6.1 Pulsed Gradients

Gradient hardware is designed so that it can deliver pulses, much like the RF coil and trans-

mitter discussed earlier. In modern instruments the gradient amplitude can be controlled

digitally so that the amplitude of the gradient can be made a function of time. Figure 6.1

shows the transverse magnetization along an arbitrary gradient direction ˆs after a gradient

pulse.

6.1.1 Pulse Sequence

A series of RF and gradient pulses, interspersed with delays and acquisition periods, is

called a pulse sequence. We have already seen an example (without gradients) in ﬁgure5.1.

6.2 Secular Approximation of Quasi-static Fields

In the presence of a large applied magnetic ﬁeld, small additional static (or slowly varying)

ﬁelds such as gradients can be treated as a perturbation1. We can look at the effect of a

gradient on the Larmor frequency ﬁrst with the gradient ﬁeld ∆ ~B(x) = Gxx ˆz oriented in

the same direction as the applied ﬁeld ~B0=B0 ˆz, and then with the gradient ﬁeld oriented

orthogonally ∆ ~B(x) = Gxx ˆy.

When the gradient ﬁeld is oriented parallel to ~B0 we have

smaller than 200 mT

ignored.

The above approximation of ignoring ﬁeld components perpendicular to the static ﬁeld

is called the secular approximation or taking the secular component of the ﬁeld. We will

address the secular component of ﬁelds that include a rotating component (are rapidly vary-

ing) in section 11.3 and appendix A.4.

DIFFUSION

In many NMR and most MRI experiments the sample of interest is a liquid or composed

of liquids in biological compartments. There are many fortuitous properties of a liquid

sample that make NMR easier than on a solid sample. When the nucleus of interest is

in a liquid, the random motion of molecules causes an averaging effect on the ﬁelds due

to other nearby nuclei and molecules. This contributes to so called “motional narrowing”

giving liquids much narrower spectral lines than solids. For details see references [30, sec.

X] [49] [9, ch. 15] [36, ch. X] and [50, sec. 5.12].

We can think of a molecule in a liquid as taking a “random walk” in three dimensions.

Assuming no macroscopic ﬂow (or convection), the motion will be mainly due to thermal

kinetic energy and collisions with other molecules. If the sample has no barriers, and is a

normal liquid (not a liquid crystal), the motion will be isotropic, meaning that motion in

any direction is equally probable.

7.1 Fick’s Laws

Diffusion of a scalar ﬁeld c(~r, t) can be described by Fick’s ﬁrst law [51]

~J(~r, t) =

D

−

∇

c(~r, t).

(7.1)

~J is the ﬂux of a given substance (or ﬁeld), c(~r, t), is the concentration (or ﬁeld amplitude),

and D is the diffusion tensor (discussed in section 7.1.2). In simple terms this equation says

that there is a “ﬂow” from high concentration to low concentration. Heat ﬂow obeys a dif-

fusion equation and so does the motion of molecules in a liquid (if there is no macroscopic

ﬂow or convection). We can combine this with the continuity equation

Equation 7.2 says that the time rate of change in concentration must be equal to the diver-

gence of the ﬂux (what goes into a small volume either goes out or increases the concen-

tration). Fick’s second law, also called the diffusion equation, is therefore

where D is a constant, for isotropic diffusion.

7.1.1 Diffusion in 1d

be found a distance x from its starting point is given by

Equation 7.5 says that the probability is normally distributed (as expected from a large

It also is the solution to the 1d diffusion equation

∂P (xn, t)

(7.6)

Dx is the diffusion coefﬁcient and has units of [ m2

s ]. At room temperature the diffusion

coefﬁcient of water (in water) is 2.2

s . An example is shown in ﬁgure 7.1. Notice

10−9 m2

×

that at 100 seconds there is still only a small probability of ﬁnding the molecule greater

than 1mm from its starting point. This is why stirring is much more effective than diffusion

for mixing at short times.

When we have a large number of identical molecules we can think of molecules starting

in a small region distributing themselves into a larger region. We cannot predict where an

individual molecule will go, but we do know on average how they will be distributed. This

is also called an ergodic average.

7.1.2 Diffusion in 3d

We can treat the problem of diffusion in three dimensions separably, that is as three one

dimensional problems. In this case we can consider the possibility of the diffusion coef-

ﬁcients in each direction being different. This is not the case for most pure liquids, but is

often the case in biological tissues where barriers and restriction in compartments cause

the “apparent diffusion coefﬁcient” to depend on direction. In general, the apparent diffu-

sion in a biological sample coefﬁcient could be more complicated, depending on the exact

direction of interest.

In the 3d case the probability distribution is

A useful extension is to allow the axes, while still orthogonal, to be rotated in an arbitrary

direction. This leads to the so called “diffusion tensor”[52],

We deﬁne the reciprocal diffusion tensor as

7.2 Self-Diffusion in water

In NMR and MRI we are often interested in self-diffusion of water. This is the diffusion of

water molecules in a solution that is composed of other water molecules. In order for this

diffusion to be detected we must “label” the water molecules in some manner. The most

convenient way to label the water molecules is by using a gradient or RF pulse to change

the amplitude or orientation of the nuclear magnetization of the 1H molecules. We can now

talk about the diffusion of the magnetization itself.

Since magnetization is a vector quantity we have to modify the diffusion equation to

operate on a vector ﬁeld. This is to say that diffusion operates on each of the components of

57

(7.14)

the magnetization. The equation for magnetization with (isotropic) diffusion in the rotating

frame is

7.2.1 Diffusion Weighting with Gradients

Application of gradients during an NMR or MRI experiment can cause additional attenu-

ation of the signal when there is signiﬁcant diffusion. In early experiments [46] this was

recognized as a confounding factor in measuring T2. Later, NMR and MRI measurement of

the diffusion properties of solutions and biological samples developed into a rich subﬁeld

in itself [53, 52, 51, 54].

When no gradients are present, diffusion will not explicitly affect the NMR signal1.

When a gradient is applied, the phase of spins in the transverse plane is altered as a func-

tion of position along the direction of the gradient (there is also dependence on gradient

strength and the duration). If there is diffusion along the gradient direction, then spins la-

beled with one phase will move into regions of spins having a different phase. This causes a

net reduction in the macroscopic transverse magnetization, and detected achievable signal.

A pulse sequence where the signal responds in a known manner to diffusion is called “diffu-

sion weighted.” It is also possible to have diffusion weighting due to diffusing longitudinal

magnetization.

BLOCH EQUATIONS

The Bloch1 equations are a set of coupled differential equations that describe the behavior

of the macroscopic magnetization [14, 36, ch. III. sec. II.]. The equations can account

for the effects of precession, relaxation, ﬁeld inhomogeneity, and RF pulses that we have

already seen in previous sections. If one considers the magnetization as a function of space

as well as time, we can include the effects of gradients and diffusion [55, 51].

geneity and susceptibility effects. All ﬁelds could be written as functions of ~r if we wish to

capture inhomogeneity and gradient effects. ~B1and ~Gsare also functions of t as determined

1sometimes called Bloch-Torrey (for tipped coordinates) or Bloch-Redﬁeld equations

by the pulse sequence. We write all this as

~B = ~B0 + ~B1 + ~Gss +

In general T1, T2 and D could be functions of ~r as well. We can transform to the rotat-
γ ˆz and make sure that the frequency of ~B1 is offset

accordingly.

Chapter 9

SHIMMING

Most NMR and MRI experiments rely on having a constant large applied magnetic ﬁeld

over the volume of the sample. The NMR signal is the average of the magnetization from

each small volume element of the sample.

If the applied ﬁeld varies over the sample,

the magnetization from different regions of the sample will get out of phase. This leads

to reduction in the overall signal from the sample and broadening of spectral lines. We

discussed this effect in section 4.3.

The B0 ﬁeld in an NMR spectrometer or MRI system is created by a large magnet, in

most cases a superconducting electromagnet [56, 57, 58]. Magnets designed for NMR and

MRI have very stringent requirements for homogeneity. In high resolution spectroscopy

it is often desired to get homogeneity of the order of 0.1Hz in a ﬁeld of 600MHz over a

1cm diameter volume. This is less than one part per billion. Homogeneity requirements

in imaging are much less stringent, but typically are required over much larger volumes.

One would usually like to achieve 10Hz over a 20cm diameter volume at a ﬁeld strength of

1.5T, or approximately 0.1 parts per million (ppm).

Because of imperfections in the magnet, inherent in the design, due to manufacturing

tolerances, or changes with age and use, all NMR and MRI magnets have additional smaller

magnets called shims to adjust the homogeneity [59, 60]. Often there are two or three sets

of shims, “steel,” “superconducting,” and “room temperature.” Steel shims are adjusted as

62

part of the charging procedure after the main magnet is brought up to ﬁeld. They consist of

either a set of steel slugs or bands that are placed with the help of ﬁeld mapping and ﬁtting

software. Superconducting shims are secondary coils wound within the cryostat. They are

adjusted by altering their currents after the magnet is charged and stabilized, and can also

be adjusted as part of maintenance.

In addition to imperfections in the magnet, shims compensate for susceptibility-induced

ﬁelds, which vary from sample to sample (or patient to patient in MRI). Room temperature

shims are electromagnetic coils. They are adjusted on a per sample basis. Often this is

by means of an automated “pre-scan” procedure in clinical imaging. Often, in order to

achieve narrow line-widths in NMR spectroscopy, manual shimming is necessary, which

can be time consuming for the less experienced user.

EXAMPLE PULSE SEQUENCES

In the following sections the Bloch equations are used to solve for the magnetization and

signal for pulse sequences relevant to this dissertation.

10.1 Stejskal-Tanner Sequence

First we will look at a simple spin-echo sequence with two pulsed gradients shown in

ﬁgure 10.1. This sequence was introduced by Stejskal and Tanner [53] and is often called

Stejskal-Tanner (ST) sequence or a “pulsed-gradient spin-echo” sequence.

10.1.1 Initial Magnetization

We will start with fully relaxed longitudinal magnetization

which implies zero transverse magnetization

k = M0,

M 0

⊥ = 0.

(10.1)

(10.2)

64

Figure 10.1: Stejskal-Tanner sequence. The large time interval ∆ is the time from the start
of the ﬁrst gradient pulse to the start of the second gradient pulse. The RF pulse durations
are assumed to be negligible in this analysis.

65

We have denoted the longitudinal and transverse magnetization with the superscript 0 to

designate the initial condition.

10.1.2 Excitation Pulse

The ﬁrst RF pulse is a 90◦ pulse. This excites all of the magnetization into the transverse

plane. We use the superscript 90 to denote the magnetization state after the 90◦ pulse. The

phase of the pulse is φ90 = 0 (denoted by ˆx in the rotating frame) so we end up with our

transverse magnetization along ˆy (or the imaginary direction) after the pulse. We have,

therefore,

M 90

k = 0,

M 90

⊥ = i M0.

The durations of both RF pulses in the sequence are assumed to be negligible compared

to the gradient durations δ and the echo time T E.

10.1.3 Gradient Pulse δ without Relaxation or Diffusion

In general there will be T1and T ∗

2 relaxation occurring after excitation, but we will neglect

this for the moment. Also, we will neglect diffusion for the moment and look at the solution

to the Bloch equation in the presence of the gradient pulse. In the rotating frame the Bloch

equation is

d ~M
dt

= γ ~M

[Gs(t) s ˆz],

×

which is equation 8.5 with only the gradient term. The gradient is along the arbitrary

direction ˆs and s is the distance along ˆs from the origin.

By neglecting relaxation, we need only consider the Bloch equation for the transverse

This says that the instantaneous pitch of the magnetization twist along ˆs is equal to the

integral over time of the gradient.

10.1.4 Gradient Pulse δ with Diffusion

The effect of diffusion will be to introduce a time-dependent term to the solution in equation

10.6, which for now we can assume to be complex valued (it could alter the phase of the

magnetization)

M⊥(s, t) = A(t) M⊥initiale−i 2 π q(t) s.

10.1.6 180◦ Pulse

The effect of the 180◦ pulse is to invert the ˆy component of the transverse magnetization.

It would also invert the longitudinal magnetization if present. Note that the sign of the

imaginary argument of the exponential (the gradient twist) is reversed. We can think of this

as a change of the sign of q, giving

10.1.7 Second T E

2 Delay

At the end of the second T E

2 delay, the phase acquired during the ﬁrst T E

2 delay due to

inhomogeneity (or chemical shift) will cancel. This is due to the change in the sense of the

helix due to any ﬁeld (we have only included the Gradient explicitly) by the 180◦ Pulse.

Since attenuation due to diffusion depends on q2, the attenuation continues to accumulate

as during the ﬁrst T E

2 delay. Just before the second gradient pulse δ2 we have

10.1.8 Second Gradient Pulse δ2

First we will make a few observations. We will want q(∆ + δ2) = 0 when we acquire

the FID, otherwise the transverse magnetization is still twisted, and the signal is spoiled.

This means that the area of the ﬁrst gradient should be equal and opposite to the area of the

area. What we must remember is the effect of the 180◦ pulse. The effect of the pulse is to

reverse the imaginary (ˆy) component of M⊥ which in our complex notation meant changing

the sign of the q accumulated before the pulse. Now the two positive gradients will cancel

since they are on opposite sides of the 180◦ pulse. We see this mathematically as

10.2 Stimulated Echo

The stimulated echo was ﬁrst reported by E. L. Hahn [41, ﬁg. 6g]. The sequence (see

ﬁgure 10.2) is similar to a spin echo sequence. The major difference is that the 180◦ pulse

is split into two pulses with a delay in between. The path that the magnetization leading

to the ﬁnal FID takes is longitudinal between the last two pulses. Also there is a 50% loss

of signal in all but the ideal perfectly homogeneous no-gradient case, due to the process

of rotating the twisted transverse magnetization helix into the longitudinal direction. The

major advantage of the stimulated echo sequence is that during the τ2 time period there is

no T2 relaxation[61, 62]. This potentially allows a long ∆ without losing as much signal as

in a spin echo if T2 < T1.

We can analyze the stimulated echo in a similar manner to the spin echo, using some

of our previous results for the attenuation of transverse magnetization due to diffusion. In

addition we will see that we need a similar expression for the attenuation due to diffusion

of longitudinal magnetization.

This assumes that during the RF pulse all other terms (relaxation, diffusion) in the

Bloch equations are negligible and that the pulse is on-resonance. φα is the phase of the

RF pulse, corresponding to the orientation of the B1 ﬁeld in the rotating frame. α is the ﬂip

The effect of the gradient is to twist the transverse magnetization along the direction ˆs. q is

q(δ) as deﬁned in equation 10.7. We already know that we need to consider diffusion during

the period δ from section 10.1. We will also consider relaxation, but neglect off-resonance

and inhomogeneity effects. We will assume a solution of the form

M⊥ = e−i 2π q sA⊥(τ1) R⊥(τ1) M α

10.2.4 τ1 Delay

We now consider the delay τ1, which we will make inclusive of the delay δ. We will again

neglect off-resonance effects, and since there are no gradient or RF pulses we will be left

with relaxation and diffusion. This is the same situation as during the δ delay, except that q

is constant after δ. We can re-use the results from above to get

10.2.5 β Pulse

We handle the β RF pulse similarly to α, assuming that the pulse is short enough so that

there is no relaxation or diffusional attenuation. The difference is that now we have non-

zero transverse magnetization which will be rotated into the longitudinal direction. We will

see that this longitudinal magnetization has spatially varying amplitude (and will be subject

to diffusional attenuation during subsequent delays).

We will assume that the transverse magnetization after the β pulse is immediately

spoiled by the gradient, we now have

We can ignore the longitudinal component at this point as it will not contribute to the ﬁnal

for partial recovery.

10.2.8 Final Gradient and Delay

We now have enough information to know how the transverse component will behave with-

out further derivation. We note that the ﬁnal delay period is the same as the ﬁrst period, τ1.

Any phase acquired due to inhomogeneity during the ﬁrst delay will be re-phased during

the second delay. There is no phase acquired during the center delay, since the magnetiza-

tion leading to the ﬁnal observable signal interest was longitudinal.

During the ﬁnal delay, which we take to include the last gradient δ at the end, we have

Distant Dipolar Field Effects

Chapter 11

DISTANT DIPOLAR FIELD

11.1 Introduction

In Part I we introduced the various physical effects considered relevant in liquid-state NMR,

culminating in the Bloch equations (see chapter 8) for describing the classical macroscopic

behavior of an ensemble of spins. Up to this point we have neglected the explicit contribu-

tion of the ﬁeld from nuclear magnetization originating in the sample on other parts of the

sample. This gives rise to two new effects.

One is called radiation damping, and is not directly felt by the sample, but requires a

receiver coil to “feed back” an RF ﬁeld into the sample. For the most part we will discuss

radiation dampening as a nuisance to be avoided (Chapter 13).

Another is the distant dipolar ﬁeld or DDF. The term DDF has actually been modiﬁed

from “dipolar demagnetization ﬁeld” [63, p. 49-61] and both are used in the literature, the

former being an innovation of NMR researchers investigating dipolar ﬁeld-induced echoes

in liquids, or biological samples. It had been thought in liquids that static1 dipolar ﬁeld

effects, which are the source of many useful and confounding effects in spectroscopy and

imaging of solids [64], could largely be neglected due to the averaging effects of diffusion.

The ﬁrst sign that this was not true came from low-temperature physics experiments

1as opposed to dynamic dipolar ﬁelds which contribute to relaxation

84

using solid 3He in the late 1970’s and early ’80’s. Deville et al. observed unexpected

“multiple spin echoes” in low temperature solid2 3He, [65, 66, 67]. One reason for this is

that even at low ﬁeld the magnetization is very large due to the extremely low µK temper-

atures.

Observation of multiple spin echoes in water at room temperature came in the early

1990s when Bowtell, Korber, and Warren, [68, 69, 70, 71] all reported echoes or effects

they attributed to sample nuclear magnetization, coupled by the dipolar ﬁeld. At ﬁrst these

claims were sometimes disputed and attributed to other sources, especially in the case of

the Warren and collaborators 2d spectroscopy experiments [72, 70].

There has also been a lively discussion of the necessity to treat the DDF classically

or quantum mechanically [73] as intermolecular multiple quantum coherence (iMQC). In

general it has been shown that the classical description is adequate under most conditions,

and in fact has lead to the quantiﬁcation of many effects, such as diffusion weighting [74,

75], that have so far been intractable in the quantum picture.

Interest has grown steadily over the intervening years due to novel application possibil-

ities. One of the ﬁrst was the realization that signal weighting (contrast) was sensitive to

so-called “meso-scale” structure [76, 77, 78]. Meso-scale is the term used to distinguish

the scale intermediate between micro-scale processes, such as diffusion, T1, and T2, and

macro-scale, such as a resolvable imaging voxel. In other words, DDF based sequences

could probe sub-voxel structure with scale larger than the diffusion distance. This novel

imaging contrast mechanism has continued to be pursued [79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84].

The Holy Grail of in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the ability to

localize and quantify metabolite peaks at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio.

Several DDF sequences offer the possibility of obtaining higher resolution spectra than ob-

tainable with conventional NMR sequences. The ﬁrst implemented was HOMOGENIZED
2although solid, 3He has signiﬁcant “exchange narrowing”, analogous to motional narrowing in liquids

[2, 85] which stands for “homogeneity enhancement by intermolecular zero-quantum de-

tection.” Its usefulness has been demonstrated already for non-localized spectroscopy of

live animals and excised tissue [86]. HOMOGENIZED continues to be an active research

area with improved understanding of relaxation and diffusion effects and water suppression

being recently reported [87, 75, 88, 89]. Other variations of HOMOGENIZED have been

proposed as well [90, 88].

11.4 “local” form

Deville et al. [65, section B] noted that if the sample magnetization is periodic the contri-

bution of the sample magnetization to the dipolar ﬁeld becomes localized.

One can visualize this as follows4 (see ﬁgure 11.3). When one looks far from the point

of interest where one is computing the ﬁeld, there are regions of positive and negative

magnetization, at approximately the same distance and angle. This leads to an “effective

magnetization” which is the spatial average. The effective magnetization is zero, leading to

a contribution to the dipolar ﬁeld of zero. Close to the point of interest the differing regions

of magnetization have signiﬁcantly different distance or angle, and do not cancel. This

is a “Sphere of Lorentz” argument, similar to the line of reasoning presented in [94, 12].

This line of reasoning applies to the dipolar ﬁeld from both longitudinal and transverse

magnetization. In the transverse case, the magnetization is complex-valued and we can

4The visualization and ﬁrst order derivation is not how Deville et al. justiﬁed the localization, but in the

author’s opinion expands on and clariﬁes the phenomenon.

visualize the real and imaginary component separately.

Mathematically we can state the localization as follows. Consider two regions of the

sample, separated by half the modulation period. The two location vectors are ~r1and ~r2.

First, assuming they have the same equilibrium magnetization and relaxation properties,

we can write their contribution to the dipolar ﬁeld (at r=0 for convenience) as

·

δr
r

when we consider magnetized regions of the sample in the pairwise manner above.

At this point we can say that the dipolar ﬁeld originates primarily from magnetization

within a radius of r

δr . Magnetization from outside that radius contributes less signif-

∼

icantly. The weighting further favors magnetization along the direction of the modulation,

and penalizes magnetization orthogonal to the modulation (see right ﬁgure 11.3).

Although not arrived at by this argument, δr is also the so-called “correlation distance”

used in the DDF literature. The correlation distance is the distance over which the DDF ~Bd

is assumed to act in a structured sample. Contributions from farther than δr are assumed to

be negligible.

11.5 When does this break down?

There are several conditions under which the localization effect of modulating the magne-

tization will break down. The underlying cause of the breakdown is that nearby regions of

magnetization far from the point of interest for the Bd calculation no longer cancel.

92

Figure 11.3: Modulated Magnetization. Weighted Contribution to DDF.
Magnetization is shown on the left. The weighted contribution of the magnetization to the
dipolar ﬁeld at the center is shown on the right. Far from the center there is a weight of
zero. While the ﬁgure is shown in 2d, the localization applies in 3d as well, the weighting
being symmetric about the gradient axis through the center. The ~Bd experienced at the
center of the plotted region will be the integral over the 3d volume.

At the edges of a sample of ﬁnite extent (in other words, all real samples) there will be

a volume whose paired volume needed for cancellation lies outside the sample boundary,

which is assumed to have zero magnetization. This can result in magnetization far from the

point of interest contributing to Bd. One good assumption is that if the sample boundary

is far enough away (so that r

δr) from the point of interest the contribution of this

magnetization will be small.

≫

Another case is when the underlying structure of the sample has variation near the

scale of the modulation. This is a violation of the “slowly varying” condition for ~M (~r).

This results in a failure of the cancellation condition, potentially over large volumes of the

sample and not necessarily far from the point of interest. This effect had been predicted

[91], and more recently observed [95, 96] and dubbed “NMR Diffraction.”

It is ironic that this sensitivity to underlying magnetization modulation or structure

93

relative to the applied modulation has also been proposed as a contrast method for DDF

weighted MRI [97], or for potential quantization of bone density [98]. The irony comes

from the fact that there is a desire to localize a contrast that has an inherent non-locality

associated with it. There has been some reporting of the difﬁculties due to this [99], but it

is still an active topic of investigation.

11.6 “point” form

We can gain further insight for calculation of ~Bd(~r). This was again ﬁrst suggested by

Deville et al.

[65, eq.

(9)]5. The idea is that when ~M (~r) is constant (or stretched to

the less stringent condition of changing slowly or is “slowly varying” compared to ˆδr)

we can approximate the dipolar ﬁeld ~Bd(~r) as proportional to ~M ′(~r).

In other words,

the spatial integration of equation 11.8 (or convolution of 11.10) disappears, and we have

(using equation 11.17) the proportional relationship

~Bd(~r)

Λ(~r) ~M ′(~r).

∝

(11.21)

Deville et al. justify this as follows (in our notation).

First we note that the Fourier transform of ~Bd(~r) has the form

~Bd(~r)

~Bd(~ρ) =

F3{

µ0
3

Λ(~ρ) [3 Mz(~ρ) ˆz

~M (~ρ)],

−

(11.22)

and note that the convolution operation leads to a product in the transform space. We can

write as

~Bd(~ρ) = Cˆρ ~M(~ρ),
5Deville et al. developed this relationship for homogeneous magnetization, and noted that the relationship
is approximate for a sample of ﬁnite extent, but it still holds for the less stringent condition of slowly varying
magnetization.

where Cˆρ is a 3x3 matrix or tensor that depends only on the direction ˆρ, not on the radius.

When the dominant variation in ~M(~r) is one-dimensional, with constant (or slowly

varying) value orthogonal to direction ˆs, we can deﬁne

with ˆs being the direction of the applied modulation, and ~M (~r) including the applied mod-

ulation. The subtle difference here is that variation other than the induced one-dimensional

modulation on an otherwise homogeneous magnetization proﬁle is now allowed. In other

words there is an underlying magnetization proﬁle. There is not yet rigorous theoretical

justiﬁcation for equation 11.29, section 11.4 being the beginning of such justiﬁcation.

tization state. The DDF acts like a longitudinal ﬁeld term in the transverse Bloch equation

(12.5)

(12.7)

(12.8)

Bkd ef f (~r) = µ0Λ(ˆr) Mk(~r).

(12.9)

The addition of the DDF to the Bloch equations has been said to lead to “non-linear”

Bloch equations. But after the above discussion this is seen not always to be so, at least

98

when relaxation and diffusion are neglected. The DDF merely acts as an additional spatially

dependent ﬁeld term on the transverse magnetization.

12.2 The Z magnetization “Gradient”

Before our discussion of the DDF we introduced another spatially dependent ﬁeld term,

the gradient ﬁeld (see chapter 6). If we could somehow control Mk(~r), we could use it as

if it were a gradient. We will see in chapter 14 how the HOMOGENIZED pulse sequence

accomplishes this.

It is helpful to have an idea of the potential strength of the Bkd ef f (~r) ﬁeld. It will be

dependent on the concentration of spins, the B0 ﬁeld, and temperature. It is also dependent

on the direction of applied modulation ˆs. For pure water at room temperature we have

µ0M0
B0

= 2.35

10−7.

×

(12.10)

We calculate Bkd ef f (~r) for a 400MHz system (9.4T ) and ˆs = ˆz this gives

This is a very small ﬁeld. We have

Bkd ef f (~r) = 2.21 µT.

γ Bkd ef f (~r) = 10 Hz

which is the rate at which transverse magnetization will precess in the rotating frame

under the inﬂuence of Bkd ef f (~r). The reciprocal of this value is deﬁned as the “dipolar

99

demagnetization time” and is

τd ≡

1
γ Bkd ef f

= 100 ms

for our 400 MHz example.

Looking back to equation 12.2 we can understand the reason the distant dipolar ﬁeld

had been thought insigniﬁcant and ignored until recently.

If there is no modulation on

~Bd(~r), the ﬁeld looks for all purposes like a

~B term, causing potentially very small (much

△
smaller than electronic susceptibility induced) inhomogeneous broadening or a small ho-

mogeneous ﬁeld shift. The ﬁeld shift especially is not usually noticed, since it is compen-

sated by referencing to a known spectral line.

12.3 Two Component System

When there are two types of spins the situation gets more complicated. We start with

~M = ~M I + ~M S,

(12.11)

the two spin types being labeled I and S. The DDF has two contributions

~Bd(~r) = ~BI

d(~r) + ~BS

d (~r).

(12.12)

Exchanging the labels I and S gives the components for d ~M S(~r)

. Note that γ is also labeled,

dt

and that we have explicitly included the resonance offset, since in general one of the spins

must have an offset in the rotating frame.

A few things to notice:

The DDF ﬁeld terms are ﬁrst in each product of magnetizations, so that M I

k (~r) M I

⊥(~r)

denotes the DDF due to M I

k (~r) causing M I

⊥(~r) to rotate. Looking again at the equations

we see that the DDF does not “transfer” magnetization from one spin to the other. This is

as expected due to the cross-product in the Bloch equations. The DDF from one spin only

causes rotation of the other spin’s magnetization.

If the spins are signiﬁcantly different in resonance frequency (either heteronuclear or

homonuclear chemical shift), only the longitudinal magnetizations will cause a net time

average DDF1. This eliminates all the terms having prefactor 1

3 (and 1

6 for the longitudinal

form), greatly simplifying the situation.

Also note that the cross terms due to longitudinal magnetization between I and S have

prefactor 2

3 . The heteronuclear (or chemically shifted) interaction is intrinsically weaker

(for the same magnetization magnitude) than the homonuclear interaction which has pref-

interaction due to transverse magnetization. This was recently demonstrated in reference [100].

RADIATION DAMPING

13.1 What is it?

The phenomenon of radiation damping was recognized early on in NMR research [101,

102, 103]. It is caused by the ﬁeld created by the receiver coil, and can be considered a

type of (undesired) feedback from the receiver back into the sample. The term “radiation

damping” originates from the days of steady state induction experiments where the signal

was smaller or “damped” when the sample to coil coupling was high.

We can write [104]

VS(t) =

(µ0η L V )

−

1
2

dMx
dt

(13.1)

for the EMF voltage in the coil due to precessing magnetization in the sample. We have

made several simplifying assumptions. First, the coil response is uniform. Second, the

magnetization in the sample is uniform. Mx is the ˆx component of the magnetization and

thirdly we have assumed that the coil is only sensitive to this component. η is the ﬁlling

factor, representing the fraction of the sensitive volume of the coil ﬁlled by the sample. L

is the inductance of the receiver coil, and V is its sensitive volume.

The voltage induced in the coil will now induce a current in the receiver coil. This will

103

where C is the capacitance. Finally, we deﬁne the off-resonance or “detuning” parameter

When we add ~Brd as a source term to the Bloch equations (e.g. add ~Brd as a term in

equation 8.2) the equations become nonlinear, and in general much more difﬁcult to solve.

1Strictly speaking we need to consider the parameters L, C, R, Q, Z, and ωLC for the system consisting

of the coil and sample together.

13.2 What does it do?

We can decompose the dMx

term in equation 13.2 to get a glimpse of the effects of radiation

damping. Assuming we have just issued a 90◦ˆx pulse giving

M⊥ = i M0ei ω0t

(13.7)

in the laboratory frame. We can decompose this into the two linear oscillating components

(the Re and Im components of equation 13.7)

signal. We compute the derivative

Finally we can substitute equation 13.3 for Z into 13.14 to get

Unlike our transmitter-induced RF ﬁeld, B1, B⊥rd is not under direct control of the

pulse sequence. It tends to oppose the effects of the applied B1 ﬁeld (note that when our

initial pulse was along the positive ˆx axis B⊥rd is along the negative ˆx axis). This is not

surprising, as it is a manifestation of Lenz’s Law.

We can deﬁne a parameter called the radiation damping time

1
τrd ≡

which gives us a measure of the strength of radiation damping in relation to other processes

such as applied RF ﬁelds and relaxation.

When τrd ∼

τ90 (strong radiation damping), where τ90 is the duration of a 90◦ pulse,

there can be signiﬁcant problems in obtaining consistent excitation. Changes in recovery

time could lead to over or under excitation of the sample. One can potentially use special

pulses to compensate [105].

When τrd ∼

When τrd ∼

measurements of T2, there can be signiﬁcant errors [108].

When τrd ∼
Also there has been theoretical as well as experimental studies of chaotic dynamics

that can result when both radiation damping and distant dipolar ﬁeld effects are present

[109, 110, 111].

13.3 How to avoid it?

In most cases it is desirable to avoid radiation damping effects. First one must estimate

the magnitude or test for the presence of radiation damping [112] to see if one need take

special precautions.

A quick test is to detune the receiver coil (usually called the probe in high resolution

systems) while watching the shape of the FID. If the decay seems to lessen as the probe is

detuned then there is likely radiation damping2.

Examination of equation 13.15 suggests several remedies.

High resolution spectroscopists have avoided the problem of radiation damping even as

B0 ﬁelds and Q factors have increased in NMR spectrometers. This is due to the fact that

it it desirable (usually for reasons of eliminating the water signal from the spectrum) to use

deuterated solvents. This corresponds to reducing M0 in equation 13.15.

Use of a deuterated solvent is usually not possible for biological samples. In this case

one can increase ∆ by detuning the receiver coil . This also has the effect of reducing the

signal to noise ratio, which is not desirable.

There has been some investigation of active feedback systems that cancel the induced

2Thanks to Norbert Lutz, Ph.D. for suggesting this.

107

current in the receiver coil [113]. This is still an active (no pun intended) research topic.

A very effective means of radiation damping suppression is to use balanced diffusion

weighting gradients (see section 10.1). In the time period between the balanced gradients

the transverse magnetization in in a helical state (spoiled). The average magnetization M0

that the receiver coil experiences is near zero, as long as there are many twists of the helix

across the sample. Note however that this does not suppress radiation damping after the

second gradient pulse, such as during acquisition. In distant dipolar ﬁeld based sequences

this is usually not an issue as the distant dipolar ﬁeld re-phased transverse magnetization

during the acquisition period is usually much smaller than the directly excited transverse

magnetization after a 90◦ pulse.

108

HOMOGENIZED

14.1 Acronyms

There are many acronyms used to describe NMR and MRI pulse sequences. The two most

common in DDF-based activities are CRAZED and HOMOGENIZED. CRAZED stands

for “COSY Revamped by Asymmetric Z Gradient Echo Detection” [114]. HOMOGE-

NIZED is the variation of CRAZED we are interested in. It stands for “HOMOGeneity

ENhancement by Intermolecular ZEro quantum Detection” [2].

14.2 Sequence

The sequence shown in Figure 14.1 consists of three RF pulses, α for excitation, β to

convert helical transverse magnetization to Mz modulation, and π to form a spin-echo. The

Gs gradient in combination with β creates spatially-modulated longitudinal magnetization

whose magnetic ﬁeld causes unwinding (and eventually rewinding) of helically twisted

transverse magnetization [115].

The goal of the HOMOGENIZED sequence is to obtain a high resolution 1d spectrum

by performing a 2d acquisition and projecting along the F 2 dimension.

109

110

14.3 Step by Step HOMOGENIZED

It is helpful to visualize the HOMOGENIZED sequence in a step by step manner, noting

analogies to more commonly understood spin behavior. The process is twofold, ﬁrst, noting

when the sequence does not utilize the DDF and so behaves as conventionally expected,

and second, noting when the sequence utilizes the DDF and how the behavior departs from

commonly understood behavior. We will also note simplifying assumptions that have been

made along the way. The following description is done in the rotating frame of the solvent

S.

and

14.3.1 Excitation by the α pulse

First, the HOMOGENIZED sequence excites the system with the α pulse. This will usu-

ally be a 90◦ pulse, unless utilizing a short T R in which case one might use the Ernst

angle (see section 4.1.1). We will use a non-selective 90◦, phase φα, “hard” pulse, although

variations of HOMOGENIZED have used selective pulses [89]. We start with fully re-

laxed magnetization, with two spin types I and S. After the α pulse we have, using the

longitudinal/transverse notation,

M α

⊥ = i [M I

k = 0.

(14.1)

(14.2)

This is for a homonuclear system where the hard pulse has bandwidth to cover both I and

S magnetization.

14.3.2 Gsgradient

The Gs gradient of duration δ causes the transverse magnetization to “twist” along the ˆs

spatial direction. The pitch of the twist is

q =

Gsδ.

(14.3)

and

and

k = 0.

(14.5)

14.3.3 τmix delay

During the τmixdelay (which includes δ) we will have phase “evolution” of transverse mag-

netization due to resonance offsets, in this case the chemical shift. We will assume that

the S magnetization is on-resonance and that there is a chemical shift of I relative to S of

σ. We will neglect other effects such as ﬁeld inhomogeneity, relaxation, and diffusion for

now. This gives us

⊥ = i [M I

(14.7)

112

(14.8)

We will assume that σ is large enough to meet the condition

σ ω0
2π ≫

1
τd

where τd, deﬁned in section 12.2, is the timescale it takes the DDF to cause signiﬁcant

precession of magnetization. τd needs to be computed from the sum of both S and I

magnetizations when both are signiﬁcant. The condition states that the chemical shift will

dephase or average to zero any DDF component originating from transverse magnetization.

As a practical guide, the I and S peaks in the spectrum should not signiﬁcantly overlap due

to inhomogeneous broadening (T2relaxation) for this condition to be met.

14.3.4 β pulse

The purpose of the β pulse is to form spatially-modulated longitudinal magnetization from

the “twisted” transverse magnetization. β is again assumed to be a “hard” pulse with sufﬁ-

cient bandwidth to cover both I and S resonance offsets.

The ﬂip angle of β controls the “depth” or magnitude of the modulation. We will see

that different ﬂip angles for β can lead to different classes of signals being optimized at the

end of the sequence.

We will look at the case where β has phase

ˆy or φβ =

−

2 . We now have

We notice immediately that the longitudinal component amplitude is maximized when

β = π

2 or 3π

2 . The real (ˆx) transverse component is concomitantly minimized. Both trans-

verse and longitudinal components have spatial variation (modulation) due to the gradient,

and chemical shift variation is present for the I magnetization.

14.3.5

τecho
2 Delay

The τecho delay is split in half by the π RF pulse, forming a spin-echo. During the ﬁrst

half of the delay period τecho

2 we will again have chemical shift evolution, but this will

be refocused at the spin echo point. Since we now have longitudinal magnetization, we

will have a DDF. This DDF is not averaged away by off-resonance effects as described in

section 14.3.3.

The spatially-varying longitudinal DDF will alter the phase of the transverse magnetization,

which also has spatial variation. At this point we will make the simplifying assumption that

all spatial variation is due to the applied gradient. We will also conduct the analysis ﬁrst

for transverse I magnetization.

The I transverse magnetization is

14.5 Interpreting the results

The equations 14.46 and 14.47 lead to a series of peaks in a two dimensional spectrum.

The ei σ ω0(t−τecho) term causes the shift in the directly detected F2 dimension. This term is

missing from the S magnetization which for simplicity was made on resonance. Performing

multiple acquisitions while incrementing τmix provides the indirect, or F1 dimension. The

shift in the F1 dimension is determined by the ei (m−1) σ ω0τmix and similar terms.

There are theoretically an inﬁnite number of peaks (which could alias along the F1

dimension) of each type p or n but in practice relaxation will limit the number of peaks

observed. Also the relative concentration of S and I will limit the number, the largest

number of peaks observed when S and I magnetizations are in the ratio 1 to 1 [116].

Those peaks corresponding to the lowest order Bessel functions are most easily observed,

as they build the fastest, before relaxation and diffusion effects can attenuate the signal. For

example, if the I spin is present in low concentration, only the term J0[Λ(ˆs) sin(β) t
τdII
corresponding to m = 0 will have signiﬁcant amplitude for the M I cross peaks. We

]

summarize in ﬁgure 14.3 with a corresponding experimental example in ﬁgure 14.2.

Figures 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6 show the temporal behavior of relative peak amplitudes for

speciﬁc cases. For the case of β =

45◦the p-type crosspeak magnitude is maximized, and

±
135◦ the n type crosspeak magnitude is maximized.

for β =

±

We can think of the terms of the type Λ(ˆs) sin(β) τecho

inside the Bessel function in

equations 14.46, 14.47, etc. as a linear time proportional “unwinding” parameter, which

depends on ﬁeld, concentration, and γ (through M0), the ﬂip angles (only β in this case)

and on the applied gradient angle (through Λ(ˆs)).

130

14.6 Why HOMOGENIZED homogenizes...

The HOMOGENIZED signal results from refocusing due to the DDF. As long as the DDF

has not been perturbed signiﬁcantly by any susceptibility or inhomogeneity ﬁelds (during

the τmix period) there will not be signiﬁcant broadening of the chemical shifts in the F 1

dimension. This is not true of the F 2 dimension, and we still have T ∗

2 effects determining

the SNR of the acquired FID.

The condition can be stated as follows

∆B τmix ≪

G δ ∆s,

where ∆B τmix is the total magnitude of ﬁeld inhomogeneity over the sample acting over

the mixing time, and G δ ∆s is the HOMOGENIZED gradient strength duration product

multiplied by the dimension of the sample. This condition means that the modulation

pattern is undisturbed by inhomogeneity.

Another way of looking at this effect is to say that only the inhomogeneity on the scale

of q (see equation 15.3) matters, and that HOMOGENIZED “shrinks” the sample down to

size q.

We show an example in ﬁgure 14.8.

Chapter 15

HOMOGENIZED WITH T2
RELAXATION AND DIFFUSION1

15.1 Introduction

An analytical expression, equation (15.20), for the HOMOGENIZED cross peak amplitude

in the presence of diffusion and T2 relaxation has been developed2.

HOMOGENIZED [2] and its variants [89, 120] and the recently proposed IDEAL [90]

sequences have great potential for in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy [86] (MRS).

Diffusion weighting in HOMOGENIZED is present both to give intentional diffusion weight-

ing and as a side effect of the various gradients present. Stejskal-Tanner (ST) diffusion

weighting [53] during the τmix and τecho periods of the sequence can also be used to sup-

press radiation dampening. “Enhanced” diffusion weighting [121, 122, 123] is obtained by

reducing the DDF during τecho. There is an additional τecho dependent diffusion weighting

possible, due to the iZQC (intermolecular zero quantum coherence) gradient Gzq and β

pulse combination. The weighting results from diffusing modulated longitudinal magneti-

zation. Kennedy et al. [1] have shown recently that this diffusion weighting has the novel

1This chapter is expanded from ISMRM 2004, Poster 2323 [75]

of I. Ardelean and collaborators in references [118, 119]. Their analysis is similar, but covers the single
component case for double quantum DDF sequences.

132

property of being insensitive to object motion. T2 relaxation also attenuates the signal.

It is desirable to have an analytical signal equation describing HOMOGENIZED cross

peaks. This is a necessary ﬁrst step to using HOMOGENIZED for quantitative in-vitro and

in-vivo spectroscopy.

15.2 Step by Step HOMOGENIZED with T2 Relaxation

and Diffusion

We will concentrate our discussion on the 2d HOMOGENIZED sequence shown in ﬁgure

15.1. This sequence is very similar to the HOMOGENIZED sequence discussed in chapter

14 and shown in ﬁgure 14.1. The difference is that there are several additional gradient pairs

to allow control of Stejskal Tanner diffusion weighting during the τmix and τecho periods

and to allow separate control of the diffusion weighting due to Gzq. We have also added

crusher gradients around the π RF pulse.

15.2.1 Excitation by the α pulse

First, the HOMOGENIZED sequence excites the system with the α pulse. This is un-

changed from section 14.3.1. For simplicity will assume that the system starts fully relaxed,

and that we are using α = 90◦with phase φα. One could substitute the steady state values

for M I and M S , and consider α

= 90◦ which will lead to additional effects discussed in

chapter 16. The transverse and longitudinal magnetization after the α pulse are

This is for a homonuclear system where the hard pulse has bandwidth to cover both I and

S magnetization.

15.2.2 Ga gradients and delay ∆a

Here is the ﬁrst departure from chapter 14. The ﬁrst Ga is half of a gradient pair designed

to give Stejskal-Tanner diffusion weighting to transverse magnetization during a signiﬁcant

portion of the τmix time period ∆a. It also serves to keep the transverse magnetization in a

spoiled state to reduce radiation damping effects3.

The ﬁrst Ga gradient of duration δa and direction ˆsaresults in

for both I and S magnetization. The second Ga gradient has the same duration δa and

opposite magnitude, refocusing the magnetization giving q = 0. The combined effects

of the Ga gradients and ∆a delay is Stejskal-Tanner diffusion weighting as discussed in

section 10.1. The b

value for this diffusion weighting is

).

(15.4)

15.2.3 Gzq gradient

The Gzq gradient (applied along direction ˆszq) has multiple effects. It selects the desired

zero-quantum coherence pathway during τmix by twisting transverse magnetization, and

ensuring that only untwisting by the DDF (Distant Dipolar Field) leads to observable signal

at the end of the sequence. The Gzq gradient also introduces diffusion weighting. Finally it

determines the spatial scale (correlation distance) of the DDF as discussed in section 11.4.

15.2.4 τmix time period

The τmix time period is inclusive of the Ga gradient pair, Gzq gradient and their associated

delays. We assume that the duration of the α and β RF pulses is short compared to the

other delays, and include half of each pulse duration in τmix. During these pulses and

135

(15.7)

(15.8)

delays there is also T2 relaxation (and T1 relaxation which we will neglect). We can now

15.2.6 Gb gradients, ∆b delay, Gc gradients and ∆cdelay

A lot is going on during the τecho period, the DDF is beginning to refocus our desired signal.

We have T2 relaxation of transverse magnetization, T1 relaxation of longitudinal magneti-

zation (which we will again neglect), and attenuation due to diffusion for longitudinal and

transverse magnetization. For simplicity we will consider only diffusional attenuation, and

discuss DDF refocusing and T2 relaxation, which are separable, during our discussion of

signal build during τecho in section 15.2.7.

We make the assumption that the diffusion attenuation due to the presence of the spa-

tially varying DDF ﬁeld ~Bd (which has a spatially varying gradient) is negligible, a point

discussed in reference [74, section I].

The diffusion weighting becomes more complicated, as we are now concerned with

the longitudinal and transverse components, and we have applied gradients in differing

directions. This leads to increasingly complicated expressions for q and b.

The longitudinal magnetization is not affected by the Gb or Gc gradients, and its q stays

as qzq. We have attenuation due to diffusion, like in the stimulated echo sequence (section

10.2.6), with b

15.2.7 τecho and ﬁnal magnetization components

During the τecho time period we have T1 relaxation of the longitudinal magnetization (which

we will neglect for now), T2 relaxation of the transverse magnetization, and the DDF re-

phasing of our desired signal. The π pulse also has the effect of inverting longitudinal

magnetization, and the x component of the transverse magnetization. From chapter 14 we

know that the π RF pulse does not reverse the signal re-phasing due to the DDF. In addition

we have the diffusion weighting discussed in section 15.2.6.

We end up with the following transverse magnetization5

We have explicitly placed e−bkD separately in each term as we will need to consider its

value (which attenuates the DDF) throughout the τecho period (and subsequent acquisition

period t2) rather than just its ﬁnal value.

15.3 Signal

First, in order to obtain an analytical solution for a system of biological interest, we assume

that M I

0 ≪

M S

0 . Making this assumption implies that only the DDF due to M S leads to

signiﬁcant refocused signal and we can neglect the DDF due to M I . This collapses the

sums in equation 14.46 (and similarly for the others) and leads to only the terms with

accounts for the decay of longitudinal magnetization (and the DDF) and can be thought of

as an exponentially slowing ”unwinding” parameter, instead of the linear time proportional

integral of the exponentially decaying DDF during τecho.

in equations 15.4, 15.5, and 15.12.

The effect of FIS(τecho) is to stretch the time axis when diffusion weighting is signif-

icant. Equation (15.20) is valid as long as S and I are separated by 1/τS in frequency,

so that only longitudinal S magnetization contributes to signal build. Steady state values

(T R < 5 T S

dient areas are chosen correctly, radiation dampening is not signiﬁcant. Three theoretical

situations are shown in ﬁgure 15.2.

of interest (I) was TSP at 100mM concentration. Glucose was also present in solution. Field

strength is 4.7T yielding nominal τS = 200ms. A best ﬁt, adjusting M I

16.1 Introduction

NMR and MRI sequences utilizing the Distant Dipolar Field (DDF) have the relatively

unique property of preparing, utilizing, and leaving spatially-modulated longitudinal mag-

netization, Mz(s), where ˆs is in the direction of an applied gradient. In fact this is funda-

mental to producing the novel “multiple spin-echo”[65, 68] or “non-linear stimulated echo”

[127] of the classical picture and making the “intermolecular multiple quantum coherence

(iMQC)” [71] observable in the quantum picture.

Existing analytical signal equations for DDF/iMQC sequences depend on Mz(s) being

sinusoidal during the signal build period[116, 75]. Experiments that probe sample struc-

ture also require a well-deﬁned “correlation distance” which is deﬁned as the repetition

distance of Mz(s) [76, 79, 128]. If the repetition time T R of the DDF sequence is such

that full relaxation is not allowed to proceed T R < 5T1, or diffusion does not average out

the modulation, spatially-modulated longitudinal magnetization will be left at the end of

[126] in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance.

z (s). All RF pulses shown as hard for

one iteration of the sequence. The next repetition of the sequence will begin to establish

“harmonics” in what is desired to be a purely sinusoidal modulation pattern. Eventually a

steady state is established, potentially departing signiﬁcantly from a pure sinusoid.

16.2 Experimental Methods

In order to study the behavior of the steady state M SS

(s) proﬁle we have implemented a

z

looped DDF preparation subsequence followed by a standard multiple-phase encode imag-

ing sub-sequence. (Figure 16.1.) The α pulse excites the system, the gradient Gq twists

the transverse magnetization into a helix. β rotates one component of the helix back into

the longitudinal direction. For simplicity we have omitted the 180◦ pulses used to create a

spin-echo during TM and/or TB sometimes present in DDF sequences. Also, we are only

interested in Mz(s) in this experiment, not the actual DDF-generated transverse signal.

Looping the “preparation” sub-sequence thus creates the periodic Mz(s) proﬁle, spoils re-

maining transverse magnetization, and establishes M SS

(s). The ε pulse converts M SS

z (s)

into transverse magnetization, allowing it to be imaged via the subsequent spin-echo “im-

age” sub-sequence. M SS

z

(s) must be re-established by the “preparation” sub-sequence for

each phase encode. After a suitably long full relaxation delay “relax,” the sequence is re-

peated to acquire the next k-space line. This is clearly a slow acquisition method because

many T R periods are required to reach steady state in the preparation before each k-space

line is acquired. The sequence is intended as a tool to directly image the M SS

z (s) pro-

ﬁle, verifying the M SS

z (s) that would occur in a steady state DDF sequence, not as a new

imaging modality.

16.3 Theory

The effect of the ”preparation” pulse sequence was ﬁrst determined for a single iteration.

The progress along the sequence is denoted by the the superscript.

16.4 Results

We now show in Figure 16.3 representative M SS

(s) magnitude images obtained with the

z

sequence described in section 16.2 for four different values of T R = 5s, 2s, 1s, 500ms.

Figure 16.4 shows several cross sections through row #128 of Figure 16.3. The object is

an 18mm glass sphere ﬁlled with silicone oil. Data points are superimposed with the cor-

responding magnitude of the theoretical curve. The T1 of the silicone oil (at 400MHz) was

measured by spectroscopic inversion recovery to be 1.4s. A Bruker DRX400 Micro 2.5

system was used with a custom 27mm diameter 31P/1H birdcage coil. 10 T R periods were

used to establish steady state. A 10s “relax” delay was used between phase encodes to

establish full relaxation. Gq was 3ms and 2.5mT/mm, with Gspoil1 of 5ms and 100mT/mm.

No attempt was made to account for B1 inhomogeneity. A single scaling parameter was

used for all theoretical curves. We achieved good agreement with the theoretical predic-

tions. In the sequence as used, T M = T B = 7ms. A variety of other Gq directions and

strengths show similar agreement with theory. Better agreement in the ﬁt between experi-

ment and theory can be obtained with α = β = 75◦than with the nominal 90◦. A B1 map

needs to be determined to see if this corresponds more closely to the actual experimental

conditions.

16.5 Conclusions

The expressions developed and veriﬁed above should be useful to those wishing to under-

stand or utilize harmonics in the M SS

z (s) proﬁle in DDF based sequences in the situation

where the diffusion distance during T R compared with λ in negligible. This is especially

true for those carrying out structural measurements which depend on a well deﬁned cor-

relation distance. The theory should also hold for spatially-varying magnetization density

THE FUTURE OF DDF NMR AND
HOMOGENIZED

Research into DDF effects has only been ongoing for just over a decade. There is still much

more to be learned about the DDF and DDF based applications in MRI and MRS. We can

identify several fruitful lines of research that still need more investigation.

There is still a lot to be learned about the imaging properties of DDF based sequences,

such as the point spread function, contrast mechanisms, and whether the signal is truly “lo-

cal” to a voxel. There have been a number of interesting imaging applications, beyond the

initial work of try it and see what it looks like. A very intriguing application is “Multiple-

Quantum Vector Imaging” which is a fancy term for utilization of the gradient direction to

detect the orientation of sub-voxel structures [84].

Much work has been done on using the DDF to image porous structures, and in-vivo

there has been much interest in quantifying trabecular bone density[129, 77, 128, 81, 98,

82]. This work continues.

The author’s (as well as at least one other research group’s) work has recently focused

on adding localization to HOMOGENIZED in order to get spectra from a voxel in-vivo.

There have been some initial successes [130, 131]. The signal equations developed in this

dissertation, and extensions, should be useful for quantiﬁcation of metabolites utilizing

153

these new localized HOMOGENIZED sequences.

There have been recent improvements [89, 88] to HOMOGENIZED, utilizing selective

pulses on the solvent S to suppress water and boost crosspeak signal.

Quantiﬁcation of HOMOGENIZED peaks (in vitro and in vivo) is still an active and

needed research topic. Continuing the author’s work and the work of Ardelean [74] should

help quantify the effects of T1 relaxation during the τmix and τecho time periods of HO-

MOGENIZED.

Related to the issue of quantiﬁcation is determining HOMOGENIZED’s sensitivity to

pulse errors, which is magniﬁed by DDF refocusing. Using HOMOGENIZED with adia-

batic pulses should help reduce this issue, and has recently been demonstrated [130].

HOMOGENIZED based Spectroscopic Imaging is an intriguing possibility. It would

have many advantages, such as its self referencing properties which eliminate the need for

frequency shift correction (and phasing).

SOME DERIVATIONS

A.1 Equilibrium Magnetization

Any sample in an NMR experiment is composed of a large number of identical nuclei

loosely coupled to each other and the external environment (FigureA.1.) The dominant

coupling is to an external applied magnetic ﬁeld ~B0. Each nucleus possesses magnetic

potential energy

The ﬁeld will tend to cause the moments of the nuclei to align parallel to the ﬁeld, mini-

mizing the total magnetic energy

what terse, so we carry it out here in detail with some variation and much enhancement for

completeness1.

is just the ˆz component of ~Bdip. This is not so. While it does include the ˆz component, it

can also include non ˆz components as well. The operative deﬁnition is

Appendix B

The Levitt Sign Conventions

We brieﬂy review the sign conventions presented in references [15, 9, section 2.5] which

are followed throughout this dissertation. The convention properly accounts for the sense

of rotation of net macroscopic magnetization. First we have

and

ω0 ≡ −

γ B0

f0 ≡

ω0
2 π

which leads to negative Larmor frequency f0 when γ > 0. Negative Larmor frequency

corresponds to left handed precession about the B0 ﬁeld. We deﬁne the chemical shift (in

units of parts-per-million or ppm) as

δ

δref ≡

−

ωref

106 ω0 −
ωref

,

where ωref is the angular Larmor frequency of a reference compound, such as T MS or

DMS in high resolution NMR. These compounds are often deﬁned as δref = 0 ppm.

For in-vivo spectroscopy water is often the reference and is deﬁned as δref = 4.7 ppm.

167

Figure B.1: Single peak at 1 ppm by the Levitt sign convention (on a 400 MHz spectrom-
eter). Note that the Levitt sign convention correctly accounts for increasing chemical shift
toward the right, for Nuclei with positive γ and hence negative Larmor frequency.

Note that the Levitt sign convention also properly accounts for the “inverted” axis in NMR

spectroscopy where increasing positive chemical shift is plotted toward the left, since it

corresponds to increasing negative difference in Larmor frequency.

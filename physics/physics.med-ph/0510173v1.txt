Monte Carlo simulation with PENELOPE (v. 2003) is applied to calculate Leksell
Gamma Knifer dose distributions for heterogeneous phantoms. The usual spherical water
phantom is modiﬁed with a spherical bone shell simulating the skull and an air-ﬁlled
cube simulating the frontal or maxillary sinuses. Diﬀerent simulations of the 201 source
conﬁguration of the Gamma Knife have been carried out with a simpliﬁed model of the
geometry of the source channel of the Gamma Knife recently tested for both single source and
multisource conﬁgurations. The dose distributions determined for heterogeneous phantoms
including the bone- and/or air-tissue interfaces show non negligible diﬀerences with respect to
those calculated for a homogeneous one, mainly when the Gamma Knife isocenter approaches
the separation surfaces. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm an important underdosage (∼10%) nearby the
air-tissue interface, in accordance with previous results obtained with PENELOPE code with
a procedure diﬀerent to ours. On the other hand, the presence of the spherical shell simulating
the skull produces a few percent underdosage at the isocenter wherever it is situated.

1. Introduction

GammaPlanr (GP) (Elekta 1996) is a computer-based treatment dose planning system
designed to calculate the dose distributions of the Leksell GammaKnifer (GK) for
stereotactic radiosurgery of certain brain diseases. As almost all radiosurgery planning
systems, GP is quite simplistic. Using a standard set of beam data, the dose distributions in
patients are calculated by adding those corresponding to each one of the 201 beams of the
GK actually present in each particular treatment (Wu et al 1990, Wu 1992). GP assumes
homogeneous target media and tissue heterogeneities are not taken into account (Yu and
Sheppard 2003).

However, in stereotactic radiosurgery, Solberg et al (1998) have pointed out a remarkable
disagreement between Monte Carlo (MC) results and those predicted by the usual planning
systems, in case inhomogeneous phantoms are considered.

In the investigation of dose perturbations produced by heterogeneities, MC has showed
up as a useful tool, mainly because it accounts, in an adequate way, for the lack of electron
equilibrium near interfaces. For the GK, Cheung et al (2001), using the EGS4 MC code,
have found discrepancies up to 25% in case of extreme irradiation conditions, mainly near
tissue interfaces and dose edges. This contrasts with the sub-millimeter accuracy with which
GK operates (Elekta 1992).

In this paper we have investigated the eﬀects of bone- and air-tissue interfaces on
dosimetric calculations involving the GK. To simulate the GK, a simpliﬁed geometry model
of the source channels is considered to perform the calculations. This model was proposed
in Al-Dweri et al (2004) and it is based onto the characteristics shown by the beams after
they pass through the treatment helmets. It has been shown that the collimation system of
each source channel acts as a “mathematical collimator” in which a point source, situated
at the center of the active core of the GK source, emits photons inside the cone deﬁned by

2

the point source and the output helmet collimators. If an homogeneous target phantom is
considered, this simpliﬁed model of the GK produces doses in agreement with those found if
the full geometry of the source channel is considered, with those calculated by other authors
with various MC codes and with the predictions of GP, for both a single source (Al-Dweri et
al 2004) and diﬀerent multisource (Al-Dweri and Lallena 2004) conﬁgurations.

In this work we want to use the simpliﬁed geometry model of the GK to calculate doses in
case of heterogeneous target phantoms, including bone- and air-tissue interfaces. Simulations
have been performed by using the version 2003 of PENELOPE (Salvat et al 2003). We
compare our ﬁndings for the 201 source conﬁguration with those obtained by Cheung et
al (2001) with EGS4 and by Moskvin et al (2004) with PENELOPE (v. 2001). Diﬀerent
situations of the GK isocenter (both far and near the interfaces) are considered.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Leksell Gamma Knifer model

To study the eﬀect of the heterogeneities, we have used diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the phantom
depicted in ﬁgure 1. It is chosen to be a sphere with 80 mm of radius made of water except
for the two shadow regions. Region 1 is a cube with a side of 30 mm and with its center at
50 mm of the center of the phantom as shown in the ﬁgure. It is considered to be made of
material m1 which can be air (“a”), to simulate the maxillary or frontal sinuses, or water.
Region 2 consists of a 5 mm width spherical shell with its external surface situated at 5 mm
of the phantom surface. We have considered this shell made of material m2 which can be
either bone (“b”), to simulate the skull, or water (“w”). The diﬀerent phantom conﬁgurations
have been labeled as Pm1m2. With this notation, Pww labels the homogeneous phantom. The
origin of the coordinate system is chosen to be at the center of the phantom, as indicated
in the ﬁgure. In the ﬁgures below, the diﬀerent regions relevant to the calculations will be
shown in gray scales and labeled with the corresponding number in italic.

Figure 1. Schematic plot of the phantom used in our simulations.

As mentioned above, each one of the 201 sources of the GK are simulated according the

simpliﬁed geometry model which is described in detail in Al-Dweri et al (2004). It consists of
a point source emitting the initial photons in the cone deﬁned by source itself and the helmet
outer collimators. The coordinates of the 201 point sources can be found in Al-Dweri and
Lallena (2004). They are distributed in the z < 0 region and correspond to the situation in
which the isocenter of the GK coincides with the center of the phantom. For the simulations
described below, in which the isocenter is situated at diﬀerent positions, these coordinates
must be shifted. The position of the isocenter appears explicitly in the ﬁgures as I[xI, yI, zI],
with the values of the coordinates in mm.

Due to the fact that the distribution of the sources is not completely uniform, no
cylindrical symmetry is shown by the system. Thus, the doses we have calculated depend
on the three cartesian coordinates, D(m1m2)(x, y, z). The superscript refers to the materials
of the particular phantom Pm1m2 considered in the simulation. Throughout the paper, the
values of the coordinates are given in mm.

Cheung et al (2001) used a phantom similar to our Pwb. It included the 5 mm width bone
shell at 5 mm of the phantom surface as in our case, but with a full diameter of 180 mm. This
phantom cannot be positioned inside the treatment helmets in such a way that the isocenter
of the GK approaches the skull interface. That is why in our simulations we have chosen
the phantom described above, which is slightly smaller. In any case, we have compared our
results with those of Cheung et al by performing simulations with their phantom, which we
label P wb. To do that we have calculated the quantity

Dnorm(x, y, z) =

D(wb)(x, y, z)

D(wb)(x, y, z)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

max

,

which corresponds to the dose obtained for P wb divided by its maximum.

A ﬁrst evaluation of the eﬀects of the diﬀerent interfaces has been obtained by calculating

the relative diﬀerences

D(m1m2)(xI, yI, zI) − D(ww)(xI, yI, zI)
D(ww)(xI, yI, zI)

between the doses obtained at the isocenter for the heterogeneous, Pm1m2, and homogeneous,
Pww, phantoms.

In addition, we have calculated the quantity

d(m1m2)

(x, y, z) =

D(m1m2)(x, y, z)
D(ww)(x, y, z)

in order to analyze the diﬀerences observed in the dose proﬁles calculated for the diﬀerent
phantoms.

2.2. Monte Carlo calculations

PENELOPE (v. 2003) (Salvat et al 2003) has been the MC code used to perform the
calculations. PENELOPE permits the simulation of the coupled transport of electrons and
photons, for an energy range from a few hundred eV up to 1 GeV, for arbitrary materials.
PENELOPE provides an accurate description of the particle transport near interfaces.

Photons are simulated in PENELOPE in a detailed way. Electrons and positrons are
simulated by means of a mixed scheme which includes two types of events: hard events,
which are simulated in detail and are characterized by polar angular deﬂections or energy
losses larger than certain cutoﬀ values, and soft events, which are described in terms of a
condensed simulation based on a multiple scattering theory (Salvat et al 2003). The tracking

is controlled by means of the four parameters C1, C2, Wcc and Wcr, as well as the absorption
energies. All these parameters must be ﬁxed for the materials present in the geometry
considered in the simulation. Table 1 shows the values we have assumed in our simulations.
In addition we have ﬁxed the parameter smax = 1035 in all the simulations performed.

The initial source was selected by sampling uniformly between the 201 sources. Initial
photons were emitted with the average energy 1.25 MeV and uniformly in the corresponding
emission cone.

The simulation geometry has been described by means of the geometrical package
PENGEOM of PENELOPE. The three materials assumed in the simulations performed (air,
bone and water) have been generated with the code material included in the PENELOPE
package. Table 2 gives the composition and densities of these materials.

To score the doses we have considered cubic voxels with ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 1 mm,
for the 18 and 14 mm helmets, and ∆x = ∆y = ∆z = 0.5 mm, for the 8 and 4 mm ones.
In the calculation of the doses D(m1m2)(xI, yI, zI), used to determine the relative diﬀerences
∆(m1m2)
(xI, yI, zI) as given by equation (2), voxels with double width in the y direction were

The number of histories followed in each simulation has been 3 · 108. This permitted
to maintain the statistical uncertainties under reasonable levels. The uncertainties given
throughout the paper correspond to 1σ. In much of the ﬁgures, the error bars do not show
up because they are smaller than the symbols used.

considered.

3. Results

3.1. Comparison with EGS4 calculations

First of all we have compared our results with those obtained by Cheung et al (2001) using the
EGS4 code. They considered the 18 mm helmet for two situations of the isocenter: I[0,-66,0]
and I[0,0,-69]. Their results (solid curves) are compared with our ﬁndings (open squares) in
ﬁgure 2, where the values of Dnorm(x, y, z), as given by equation (1), are plotted for the three
cartesian axes and the two positions of the isocenter. As we can see, both calculations are in
good agreement for the two cases considered.

In the ﬁgure, also the predictions of the GP, quoted by Cheung et al (2001), are included
(dashed curves). For the isocenter at I[0,-66,0], a discrepancy between MC simulations and
GP results is observed in the far negative y region (see medium left panel). This is due to
the fact that the GP does not take into account the interfaces and assumes all tissue to be
uniformly represented by water. The same situation is not observed when the isocenter is at
I[0,0,-69] (see right lower panel), because in that case the dose is roughly zero before reaching
the interface (for z ∼ −80 mm).

3.2. Comparison with GammaPlan predictions

Figure 3 shows a comparison of diﬀerent simulations performed for the phantom P ww (open
squares) with GP predictions of Hamad and Mherat (2005) (dashed curves). In the upper
panels the isocenter is situated at I[0,34,0] and the proﬁles along y axis are shown for the 18
and 4 mm helmets. The isocenter situated at I[0,66,0] in medium panels where the proﬁles
along x and z axes are shown for the 14 mm helmet. Finally, the proﬁles along y axis are
shown in lower panels, for the 14 and 8 mm helmets and the isocenter situated at I[0,70,0].
As we can see, the simulation for the water phantom produces results in very good
agreement with the GP predictions. Below (see section 3.4), the eﬀects of the interfaces in
these cases will be analyzed and it will be clear that GP cannot describe these eﬀects.

This is evident also in right tail of the proﬁles shown in the lower panels. We can see
how a clear discrepancy between the simulation and the GP appears at y = 80 mm, that is,
at the external border of the phantom. There in, an interface air-water is considered in the
simulation, while GP does not take into account such a situation.

3.3. Eﬀects of the tissue inhomogeneities on dose at the isocenter

Now we analyze the results obtained for diﬀerent positions of the isocenter of the GK, paying
special attention to the situations in which the isocenter is close to the interfaces.

First, we have investigated the eﬀects of tissue inhomogeneities on the doses calculated
at the isocenter. We have varied its position by ﬁxing the coordinate yI at diﬀerent values
ranging from -70 mm to 70 mm and maintaining xI = zI = 0. The results obtained for the
relative diﬀerences with respect to the homogeneous phantom, ∆(m1m2)
(0, yI, 0), as given by
equation (2), are shown in ﬁgure 4. Therein, upper panels correspond to the phantom Pwb;

Figure 2. Dose proﬁles at the isocenter, relative to their respective maxima, in

(medium) and z (lower) axes. Left panels correspond to the isocenter situated at
I[0,-66,0], while in the right panels the isocenter is at I[0,0,-69]. Open squares are the
results of our simulations. Full curves correspond to EGS4 results quoted Cheung et
al (2001). Dashed curves correspond to the predictions of GP quoted by the same
authors. The phantom P wb has been considered in this case.

medium panels represent the results in case of the heterogeneous phantom Paw, and, ﬁnally,
in the lower panels the phantom Pab has been considered. We have plotted the results for
the 18 mm (left panels) and 8 mm (right panels) helmets. Similar results are obtained for
the 14 and 4 mm helmets.

As we can see, the presence of the bone spherical shell (upper panels) produces a
reduction of the dose at the isocenter with respect to that obtained for the homogeneous
phantom. This reduction is observed at practically any position of the isocenter, being ∼
3% for the two helmets. A higher perturbation in the dose is observed when the isocenter
is situated exactly at the interface bone-water, yI = ±70 mm. In this case, the reduction in
the dose rises to 5% for the 18 mm helmet and it is even larger for the 8 mm one. It seems

evident from our results that the eﬀect of the full skull, which we simulate here by means of
the bone spherical shell, is not negligible at all.

To have an idea about the origin of this eﬀect, we have evaluated the reduction in the
dose due to the bone inhomogeneity in a very simple case. We have considered a photon
pencil beam coming from the source and reaching the phantom and we have calculated the
dose at the isocenter neglecting scattering photons. In case the phantom Pwb is considered,
the dose at the isocenter is proportional to (see e.g. Berger, 1968)

(0, yI, 0) in percentage, between the doses
calculated at the isocenter for heterogeneous and homogeneous phantoms (see
equation (2)). Upper panel corresponds to the phantom Pwb; medium panel

the phantom Pab has been considered. Results for the 18 mm (left panels) and 8 mm
(right panels) helmets are shown.

where (µen/ρ)w is the mass energy absorption coeﬃcient of water at the initial energy of
the photons, E0, and µa, µw and µb are the attenuation coeﬃcients of air, water and bone,
respectively, at the same energy. The values si correspond to the length of the trajectory
segments traveled in the region i of the phantom and thus,

r = s4 + s3 + s2 + s0

is the distance from the source to the isocenter. If we consider the phantom Pww,

E0

We are interested in the fraction of both doses, which is given by

D(wb)(xI, yI, zI)
D(ww)(xI, yI, zI)

= exp [−(µb − µw)s2] .

For the photon energy considered in our simulations, E0 = 1.25 MeV, the attenuation
coeﬃcients can be calculated easily (see Hubbell and Seltzer, 2004) and one obtains µb =
0.11174 cm−1 and µw = 0.06323 cm−1. On the other hand the length s2 can vary from source
to source, depending on the position of the isocenter. If the phantom is centered with respect
to the helmet, that is if the isocenter is at I[0,0,0], s2 = 5 mm for all the sources. In this

case the dose ratio is 0.976, and a reduction of 2.4% is found. This is the minimum reduction
found for all positions of the isocenter. By varying them in the interval (−70 mm,70 mm)
in the three directions, we sample the full volume of the phantom, s2 ranges between 0.5 cm
and 2.7 cm and the reduction due to the bone inhomogeneity varies between 2.4% and 12.2%.
These results indicate that, as we have found in our simulations, a few percent reduction in
the dose at the isocenter is expected due to the bone inhomogeneity, independently of the
position of the isocenter.

ww

The air-tissue interface (central panels) produces a slight increase (1-2% at most) in the
dose at the isocenter, in comparison with that found for the homogeneous phantom, when
it is situated far from the separation surface. When the interface is approached the relative
diﬀerence ∆(m1m2)
increases, the dose at the isocenter for the inhomogeneous phantom is
∼5% larger than that obtained for the homogeneous phantom and this occurs until a point
very close to separation surface is reached. Once the isocenter is situated at this position,
the dose calculated for the heterogeneous phantom reduces strongly with respect to that of
the homogeneous one. This reduction is ∼ 15% in the inner side and ∼ 10% in the outer side
of the air cube.

A similar situation is observed when both interfaces are present (lower panels) except
for a general decrease of the dose at the isocenter whatever yI is. This shift toward smaller
doses is due, as said before, to the presence of the skull, as we can see clearly in the region
yI < 0, far from the air interface, which shows a behavior rather similar to that plotted in
the upper panels. One should point out the fact that the overdosage observed in the region
around yI = 30 mm for the Paw phantom is largely reduced when, in addition, the bone shell
is considered.

the isocenter is situated at I[0,34,0]. The proﬁles in the y-axis are shown for the four

have been obtained with the phantom Pwb. Dashed curves represent the results in
case of the heterogeneous phantom Paw. Dotted curves take into account the phantom

Figure 6 shows the proﬁles along the y-axis for the four helmets and for the isocenter
at I[0,34,0]. Therein the squares correspond to the homogeneous phantom Pww, while
solid, dashed and dotted curves have been obtained with the phantoms Pwb, Paw and Pab,
respectively. If only the bone is considered (solid curves), a reduction in the plateau region
including the maximum dose is observed. This is the same reduction previously discussed for
the dose at the isocenter.

On the contrary, the presence of the air-tissue interface (dashed curves) produces a
strong reduction of the dose on the “air” side (the right side in this case) of the interface
and an enhancement of the dose proﬁle on the “water” side (the left side in this case) of the
separation surface. This eﬀects are better seen for the 18 helmet. The main eﬀect of the
simultaneous consideration of both interfaces (dotted curves) is to cancel the overdosage on

the left side of the interface. The results here obtained are very similar to those plotted in
the ﬁgure 6 of the work of Moskvin et al (2004). These large diﬀerences in the dose produced
by the air-tissue heterogeneities cannot be neglected.

Figure 7 depicts the results obtained for the 14 mm helmet when the isocenter is situated
at I[0,66,0]. The diﬀerent curves correspond to the same phantoms as in the previous ﬁgure.
Here the proﬁles along the three cartesian axes are plotted. Two facts deserve a comment.
First, it is appreciable in the upper and lower panels the reduction of the dose produced by
the presence of the air-tissue interface (dashed and dotted curves). Also, the comparison
between both curves gives us an idea of the additional diminution produced by the bone
shell. Second, it is again evident (see medium panel) the strong overdosage produced if the
air-tissue interface is not taken into account, but it is also remarkable the reduction in the
dose observed in the region 2 when the bone shell is considered (solid curve).

the isocenter situated at I[0,70,0], that is exactly at the bone-tissue interface. Apart from
the reductions observed in the dose nearby the air-tissue interface, here the eﬀect of the bone
shell in region 2 is, as expected, stronger than in the previous case.

To ﬁnish we point out that, as it is observed in ﬁgures 6 and 8 and in the medium panel
of ﬁgure 7, the dose in the interface air-water is, in all cases, ∼50% of the maximum dose
obtained for the homogeneous phantom. This result is into agreement with the ﬁndings of
Moskvin et al (2004).

4. Conclusions

In this work we have investigated the dosimetry of the GK in case of heterogeneous phantoms
by considering a simpliﬁed source model for the single source channels. Calculations have been
done by using the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE (v. 2003) for the conﬁguration including
201 unplugged sources and for diﬀerent positions of the isocenter of the GK.

The use of the simpliﬁed model produces results for the dose proﬁles at the isocenter
which are in agreement with previous calculations done with EGS4, whereas they show
discrepancies with the predictions of the GP, mainly at the interfaces.

In general we can say that the presence of typical tissue inhomogeneities produces
an underdosage with respect to the results obtained when an homogeneous phantom is
considered. This happens for almost all the positions of the isocenter of the GK. This
underdosage can reach values larger than 10% in the vicinity of air-tissue interfaces. The
only exception of this conclusion occurs when the isocenter is situated at a distance of
a few millimeters of the air-tissue separation surface, where an overdosage is produced.
However, this overdosage is very small if, in addition to the tissue inhomogeneity, also the
bone inhomogeneity is considered.

We have analyzed the doses deposited in phantoms

including bone and air
inhomogeneities and we have found non-negligible discrepancies with the doses obtained

13

in case of water homogeneous phantom. In this respect it is worth to mention that an air
inhomogeneity simulating the maxillary or frontal sinuses, give rise to large modiﬁcations of
the dose proﬁles.

We have found a reasonable agreement with previous calculations performed by Moskvin

et al with PENELOPE code in the case of the air-tissue interfaces.

In what refers to the bone-tissue inhomogeneity representing the skull, our results show a
∼ 3% underdosage at the isocenter, with respect to the doses calculated for the homogeneous
phantom. This eﬀect can be observed wherever the isocenter is situated.

The discrepancies observed between the results obtained for heterogeneous and homo-
geneous phantoms suggest that GP predictions must be corrected in order to take care of
the air- and bone-tissues inhomogeneities, mainly in those cases in which the interfaces are
present nearby the target area.

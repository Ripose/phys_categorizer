The inverse geometric approach to the modeling of the growth of circular objects revealing required
features, such as the velocity of the growth and fractal behavior of their contours, is presented.
It enables to reproduce some of the recent ﬁndings in morphometry of tumors with the possible
implications for cancer research. The technique is based on cellular automata paradigm with the
transition rules selected by optimization procedure performed by the genetic algorithms.

Introduction

Understanding the fundamental laws driving the tu-
mor development is one of the biggest challenges of con-
Internal dynamics of a tu-
temporary science [1, 2].
mor reveals itself in a number of phenomena, one of
the most obvious ones being the growth. Overtaking
its control would have profound impact to therapeutic
strategies. Cancer research has developed during the
past few decades into a very active scientiﬁc ﬁeld tak-
ing on the concepts from many scientiﬁc areas, e. g.,
statistical physics, applied mathematics, and nonlinear
science [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. From
a certain point of view, the evolution of tumors can be
understood as an interplay between the chemical inter-
actions and geometric limitations mutually conditioning
each other. Consequently, it is believed that malignancy
of a tumor can be inferred exceptionally from the geo-
metric features of its interface with the surrounding it
tissue [16, 17]. Formation of the growing interface is in a
continuum approximation described by a variety of al-
ternative growth models, such as Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
[18] , molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [19], or Edwards-
Wilkinson equations. At the same time, the growth
properties can be classiﬁed into universality classes [20],
each of them showing speciﬁc scaling behavior with cor-
responding critical exponents. As implies scaling analysis
of the 2-dimensional tumor contours [21, 22], the tumor
growth dynamics belongs to the MBE universality class
characterized by, (1) a linear growth rate (of the radius),
(2) the proliferating activity at the outer border, and
(3) diﬀusion at the tumor surface.

In vitro grown tumors usually form 3- (or 2-) dimen-
sional spherical (or close to) aggregations, called mul-
ticellular tumor spheroids (MTS) [23]. These provide,
allowing strictly controlled nutritional and mechanical
conditions, excellent experimental patterns to test the

validity of the proposed models of tumor growth [24].
These are usually classiﬁed into two groups, (1) contin-
uum, formulated through diﬀerential equations, and (2)
discrete lattice models, typically represented by cellular
automata [25, 26, 27], agent-based [28], and Monte Carlo
inspired models [29].

Here we present the inverse geometric approach to the
MTS growth simulation, enabling us to evolve an initial
MTS by required rate as well as desired fractal dimension
of its contour. The method is based on the cellular au-
tomata paradigm with the transition rules found by the
genetic algorithms.

Simulation and optimization tools

Cellular automata (CA) [30] were originally introduced
by John von Neumann as a possible idealization of bio-
logical systems. In the simple case they consist of a 2D
lattice of cells s(t)
ij ∈ {0, 1}, i, j = −(LD/2), −(LD/2) +
1, . . . LD/2, where t = 0, . . . , τ , is the time step and LD
size of the 2D lattice. During the τ time steps they evolve
obeying the set of local transition rules (CA rules) σ, for-
mally written

Any deterministic CA evolution is represented by the

possible
global behaviors, predestining CA to be the eﬃcient sim-
ulation and modeling tool [31]. Inherent nonlinearity of
CA models is, however, a double-edged sword. On the
one hand, it enables to model a broad variety of behav-
iors, from trivial to complex, on the other hand it results
in diﬃculty with ﬁnding the transition rules generating
the desired global behavior. No well-established universal

technique exists to solve the problem, and, despite spo-
radic promising applications of genetic algorithms (GA)
to solve the task [32, 33, 34], one typically implements
CA by ad hoc or microscopically reasoned deﬁnition of
the transition rules.

Genetic Algorithms (GA) [35] are general-purpose
search and optimization techniques based on the anal-
ogy with Darwinian evolution of biological species.
In
this respect, the evolution of a population of individ-
uals is viewed as a search for an optimum (in general
sense) genotype. The feedback comes as the interaction
of the resulting phenotype with environment. Formal-
izing the basic evolutionary mechanisms, such as muta-
tions, crossing-over and survival of the ﬁttest, the fun-
damental theorem of GA was derived (schema theorem)
which shows that the evolution is actually driven by mul-
tiplying and combining good (quantiﬁed by an appropri-
ate objective function), correlations of traits (also called
schemata, or hyperplanes). The remarkable feature re-
sulting from the schema theorem is the implicit paral-
lelism stating that by evaluating a (large enough) popu-
lation of individuals, one, at the same time, obtains the
information about the quality of many more correlations
of the traits.

Bellow we present the application of GA optimization
to ﬁnd the CA rules producing the 2D CA evolution by
required rate as well as fractal behavior of the contour.

Optimization Problem

In the below numerical studies two competing hypothe-
ses of the rate of the desired tumor mass production have
been distinguished,
a) broadly accepted exponential growth of the tumor
mass:

M (t) = B +

π(R(0))2 − B
h

i

exp(C t) ,

(3)

b) the growth of the mass with linearly growing radius

and,

[21, 22],

M (t) = π(R(0) + At)2,

(4)

where R(0) is the initial cluster radius; A, B, C are con-
stants parameterizing the growth process. The term
B +
in (3) was chosen to start from the
initial cluster size M (0) = π(R(0))2 for any B.

in the case of exponential tumor mass production Eq. (3),
and

in the case of linearly growing radius model Eq. (4), re-
spectively.

The optimization task solved by GA was to ﬁnd
the CA transition rules σ∗ Eq. (2) providing the
growth from the initial pattern {s(0)

−(LD/2), . . . , (LD/2) − 1, LD/2 through the sequence of

erated accordingly to Eq. (1), with the minimum diﬀer-
ence from the above ”prescribed” patterns {p(t)

the denominator of Eq. (8), the prefactor pij in the term

The other requirement to the desired growth relates
to the geometric properties of the contour/interface.
Broadly accepted invariant measure expressing the con-
tour irregularity is the fractal dimension, DF. Using the
box-counting method it can be calculated as

DF = lim
ǫ→0

log NB(ǫ)
log(1/ǫ)

,

(9)

where NB(ǫ) is the minimum number of boxes of size ǫ
required to cover the contour. Here, it has been deter-
mined as the slope in the log-log plot of NB(ǫ) against
1/ǫ using the standard linear ﬁt.

To obtain the CA rules generating the cluster with
the required fractal dimension (σ∗), DF, the objective
function Eq. (8) has been multiplied by the factor
f2(σ) = 1 + w1(Dτ

F − DF)2,

(10)

where Dτ
F is the fractal dimension of the cluster kept after
the τ steps with the CA rules σ; the weight w1 was kept
1 in all the presented numerical results.

Finally, the rule-dependent objective function has been

written

f (σ) = f1(σ)f2(σ) .

To sum up, the optimum rule σ∗ is the subject of GA

optimization

Results and discussion

All the CA runs started from the pattern {p(0)}
Eq. (5), with the radius R(0) = 5.
In all the below
GA optimizations, all the CA evolutions ran on the 2-
dimensional box of the size LD = 300 cells and length of
the CA evolution τ = 100 (300) steps. The GA search has
been applied to ﬁnd the set of CA rules, σ∗, which gives
minimum objective function values (Eq. (8), or Eq. (11),
respectively). The size of the population was kept con-
stant (1000 individui), the probability of bit-ﬂip mutation
0.001, the crossing over probability 1, and ranking selec-
tion scheme applied. The length of the optimization was
3000 generations.

Exponential growth vs. linear radius dilemma

The simplest mathematical models of MTS growth [36]
assume exponential increase of the MTS mass during the
time Eq. (3). The above assumption is applied mainly
because of feasibility of diﬀerential and integral calcu-
lus, nevertheless revealing, hopefully, some of the char-
[21, 22] have
acteristics of the real growth. Bru et al.
shown from the morphometric studies that the mean ra-
dius of 2D tumors grows linearly. At the same time, they
have experimentally shown that the cells proliferation is
located near the outer border of cell colonies.
In this
work the former assumption has been tested and com-
pared with the alternative exponential growth (Figs. 1,
2). For that reason the GA search has been carried out to
ﬁnd the CA transition rules which minimize the criterion
Eq. (8) with exponentially growing pattern Eq. (5) during
τ = 100 steps. In the inset of Fig. 1 one can see that on
the interval of the optimization (τ = 100) the CA evolu-
tion can be in principle ﬁtted by the exponential Eq. (3)
(as it was required) as well as by Eq. (4), corresponding
to the growth with linearly increasing radius, both with
small systematic error, which can be possibly hidden in
the stochasticity of the real biological growth. On the
other hand, the extrapolation of the ﬁts beyond the in-
terval of optimization shows obvious divergence of the
CA mass production from the exponential ﬁt, meanwhile
its deviation from the regime with linearly growing ra-
dius stays small (nevertheless systematic). We attribute
the latter discrepancy to the fact that the growing inter-
face during the CA evolution is neither smooth, nor of
zero thickness, which is true also for real tumors growth.
In Fig. 2 we show the comparison of the CA mass pro-
duction, using the same CA rules as in Fig. 1, ﬁtted by
the Eqs. (3) and (4), respectively, on the interval much
longer than the interval of minimization (τ = 100). One
can see that both the ﬁts are still possible, nevertheless
the exponential ﬁt deviates crucially on the interval of op-
timization (the inset of Fig. 2). The above results show
better agreement of the CA mass production with the hy-
pothesis of the MTS growth with linearly growing radius
Eq. (4), with a slight implication towards experiments -

the growth of close-to-circular MTS is probably slightly

exponential.

Fractal behavior of the contour

Figs. 3 and 4 show the eﬃciency of the above approach
to simulate the MTS growth by any required rate (Eq. (5)
with R(t) coming from Eq. (7)), and, at the same time,
desired fractal dimensions of the contour, DF. Here, two
GA optimizations have been performed to ﬁnd the CA

rules generating the mass production minimizing both
the criteria Eq. (8) and Eq. (10) in the multiplicative
form Eq. (11) during τ = 300 steps and reaching the
desired fractal dimensions Dτ
F = 1.35 (Fig. 3), and 1.1
(Fig. 4), respectively. The obtained CA rules provide
the growth that ﬁts well to the required rate as well as
desired DF. Fig. 5 shows the ﬁnal size of the CA clus-

above results demonstrate that a speciﬁc fractal behavior
of the growing interface (Fig. 5) out of the broad range
(DF ∈< 1.05, 1.35 >) consistent with the morphometric
results [21] can be intentionally generated by here pre-
sented GA optimization approach. Moreover, the growth
rate can still be kept at desired value. Beyond these lim-
its unwanted artifacts emerge.

Scaling behavior

Bru et al.

[21, 22] used the scaling analysis to char-
acterize the geometric features of the contours of a few
tens growing tumors and cell colonies. Here we outline
the scaling behavior of the contour of the growing CA
cluster resulting from our approach.

A rough interface is usually characterized by the ﬂuc-
tuations of the height h(x, t) around its mean value h,
the global interface width [37]

W (L, t) =

(13)

the overbar is the average over all x, L is an Euclidean
size and the brackets mean average over diﬀerent realiza-
tions. In general, the growth processes are expected to
follow the Family-Vicsek ansatz [38],

W (L, t) = tβf (L/ξ(t)) ,

(14)

with the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function

f (u) =

uα
if u ≪ 1
const if u ≫ 1,

(cid:26)

(15)

where α is the rougheness exponent and characterizes the
stationary regime in which the height-height correlation
length ξ(t) ∼ t1/z (z is so called dynamic exponent) has
reached a value larger than L. The ratio β = α/z is
called the growth exponent and characterizes the short-
time behavior of the interface.

To adapt the scaling ansatz to the close-to-circular
growing CA cluster we identify the constant Euclidean
size L with the time-dependent mean radius r ≡ r(t) =
NC(t)
(
k=1 rk(t))/NC(t), rk(t) being the distance of the k-
th contour point from the center and NC(t) the numer
P
of contour points in t. Subsequently, we rewrite Eq. (13)
into

WC(t) =

the overbar being the average over all the contour points
in t and the brackets mean average over diﬀerent realiza-
tions of contours reaching the mean radius r in t, with
the scaling ansatz Eq. (14) applied

WC(t) = tβf (r/ξ(t)).

(17)

Numerical investigation of the WC(t) (Fig. 7) reveals the
region with the power law behavior. We identify the
respective slope in the log-log plot with the growth ex-
ponent β = 0.723 (ﬁtted in the region 150 ≤ t ≤ 700).

To draw more complete scenario of the growing CA
cluster scaling behavior, the deeper investigation of site-
site correlation functions in both radial and poloidal di-
rections is needed. This type of studies will follow.

Conclusion

In the paper we have presented the approach to the
modeling of multicellular tumor spheroids by required
growth rate and fractal dimension. The technique is
based on the combination of the CA modeling with the
transition rules searched by the GA. Here demonstrated
results show the feasibility of the approach in this speciﬁc
case. Based on the similarity of the geometric properties
of the CA evolution and the tumor contours (such as lo-
cality of the interaction/communication, deformed con-
tour and nonzero thickness of the proliferating layer) we
have reasoned that the MTS mass production is slightly
faster than corresponding to linearly growing radius [22].
At the same time our results imply that the often used
Gompertz curve of the tumor mass progression comes as
a higher level phenomena related to the nutrition, space
restrictions, etc. We believe that our approach could
be implemented as the backbone into the more sophisti-
cated models of tumor growth encompassing the above
higher-level mechanisms. Computationally eﬃcient on
the ﬂy scaling analysis during the CA evolution would
enable to bias the GA optimization towards the MTS
growth with desired scaling properties of the contour;
nevertheless its eﬃcient realization is the subject of our
ongoing research. Successful implementation of scaling
analysis into the optimization process could signiﬁcantly
contribute to the discussion on the scaling behavior of
the real tumors [22, 39, 40].

In our opinion the above presented optimization ap-
proach to the modeling of growing clusters by required
rate and surface properties can ﬁnd applications in many
diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as molecular science, surface design
or bioinformatics.

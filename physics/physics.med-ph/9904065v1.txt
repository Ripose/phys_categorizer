Abstract. The suitability of using the angular peak shape of the coherent backscat-
tered light for estimating the light transport parameters of tissues has been inves-
tigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue phantoms for
the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632.8nm). Results indicate that
while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it can determine the
absorption coeﬃcient only when the absorption is moderate (α > 1cm−1) for the
long transport lengths typical of tissues. Further, the possibility of determining
the anisotropy factor by estimating the single scattering contribution to the diﬀuse
It is shown that the anisotropy factor can be estimated
background is examined.
reasonably well, provided it is lesser than a limit set by the accuracy of the intensity
measurement ( g < 0.6 for our setup). The anisotropy factor is accurately estimated
by corroborating the coherent backscattering measurements with transmission mea-
surements and independently by angle-resolved scattering measurements.

Introduction

The use of light and lasers in medicine have increased manifold in the past decade.
Enormous eﬀorts have been devoted to the development of new diagnostic techniques
such as NIR imaging (Tuchin and Thomson 1994) and ﬂourescence spectroscopy of
tissues (Kortum and Sevick-Muraca 1996), as well as therapeutic uses such as pho-
tothermal coagulation and Photo-dynamic therapy( Grossweiner 1994). Tissues are
highly scattering media and an accurate knowledge of light transport parameters of
the tissue is indispensible to describe the propagation of light in these media. Several
techniques have been developed to measure the light transport parameters in tissues
(Wilson 1995). Apart from these, the use of the Coherent Backscattered peak from
tissues to estimate the transport parameters has also been suggested (Yoo et al 1990a-
b, Yoon et al 1993).

The phenomenon of Coherent Backscattering (CBS) of light by random media has
attracted considerable attention since 1985(van Albada and Lagendijk 1985, Wolf and
Maret 1985) when connection was ﬁrst made between elastic multiple scattering and
Anderson localization. This phenomenon also termed weak localization, shows up as a
sharp peak in the backscattered direction within a narrow cone of angles. The angular

width of the CBS peak is mainly determined by the transport length of light in the
medium and the shape of the peak is slightly modiﬁed by the absorption. This tech-
nique was used to characterize the transport lengths of samples used in experiments
on strong localization of light (Wiersma et al 1997). Etemad et al (1987) were the
ﬁrst to study the eﬀects of absorption in random media on the CBS peak.

†

There have been some attempts to study the CBS peak from biological tissues
and obtain the transport properties (Yoo et al 1990a-b, Yoon et al 1993). However
these studies have been slightly inaccurate, because of a misinterpretation in applying
Akkerman’s expression (Akkermans et al 1986) derived for conservative, semi-inﬁnite
media to absorptive media.
Hence a systematic study of the CBS peaks from bi-
ological tissues has not yet been made. Since this is a non-contact method which
can be used for online in-vivo measurements also, it is important that a systematic
evaluation of this technique for the measurement of transport parameters be carried
out. Eddowes et al (1995) have suggested that accurate absorption information may
be obtained by using Monte-Carlo simulations to ﬁt experimental measurements and
have developed Monte-Carlo based routines to identify the optical coeﬃcients for a
given CBS angular proﬁle. However the measurement of the absorption parameter
is dependent on both the transport length and the limitations of the experimental
setup, as will be explained. and accurate absorption information can be obtained in
only limited ranges of the absorption and transport coeﬃcients. In reports that have
appeared so far, researchers have concentrated on obtaining the transport and inelastic
lengths of tissues from the shape of the CBS angular proﬁle. The possibility of using
the intensity information for estimating the anisotropy factor(g) of the scatterers has
not been examined.

In this paper, we present the results of our investigations on the suitability of using
CBS for measuring tissue transport parameters. Milk of diﬀerent concentrations have
been used as tissue phantom. It is known that the light transport properties of milk
closely resemble those of tissues and milk has been used to model light transport in
brain tissue (Greenﬁeld 1989), to study optical imaging (Morgan et al 1997), photon-
density waves (Knuttel et al 1993), and for investigating the propagation of short
laser pulses through a scattering medium (Tereshchenko et al 1998). To investigate
the eﬀects of absorption on CBS, an absorbing dye with known extinction coeﬃcient
was added to milk and the CBS from such media were studied. We also examine
the possibility of determining the anisotropy factor (g) from the the single scattering
contribution to the diﬀuse background.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, the basics of coherent backscat-
tering will be brieﬂy reviewed. The experimental setup and measurement procedures
are described in section 3. In section 4, the results of our investigations are presented
and discussed. We conclude in the last section with a discussion on the limitations
and possible applications of this technique.

† These authors have described the total backscattered intensity in terms of the sum of a coherent
intensity arising from an absorbing medium and a diﬀuse intensity from a non-absorbing medium.
As the intensity reduces with absorption, the coherent contribution becomes lesser reducing the
enhancement factor in their expression. The single scattering contribution was not included either.

2. Coherent Backscattering of light

Coherent Backscattering (CBS) of light occurs in all disordered media and is the only
major surviving interference eﬀect. When a beam of light is incident on a random
medium, there exist partial waves traversing every possible path in the medium. The
CBS eﬀect arises from the constructive interference of any partial wave with its time
reversed counterpart in the medium. In exactly the backscattered direction, both these
two waves have the same phase and constructive interference results. Away from the
backscattered direction, the counterpropagating paths develop a phase diﬀerence de-
pending on the relative positions of the ﬁrst and last scattering events in the medium.
For the ensemble of all possible light paths, these phases will randomize and the re-
ﬂection is enhanced within a narrow cone in the backward direction with an angular
width of the order of λ/lt where λ is the wavelength of light and lt is the transport
length in the medium. This peak shows up only after the ensemble averaging over
the large scale sample speciﬁc ﬂuctuations (speckle) that originate from the random
medium (Etemad et al 1986).

The CBS intensity can be described in terms of three contributions. The total

normalized angular intensity is described (Wiersma et al 1995a) by

I(θ, L) =

γc(θ, L) + γl(θ) + γs(θ)
γl(0) + γs(0)

where γc, gammal and γs are the bistatic coeﬃcients of the coherent, diﬀuse and single
scattering contributions respectively. θ is the angle of scattering and L represents the
set of transport lengths in the medium. The set of relevant transport parameters are
the mean scattering length(ls), the mean transport length (lt), the inelastic length
(li) deﬁned as the reciprocal of the absorption coeﬃcient (α) and the anisotropy
factor (g)which is deﬁned as the average of the cosine of the scattering angle for a
g). The bistatic coeﬃcients for the
single scattering event and related as ls = lt(1
diﬀuse and coherent intensities are traditionally described by summing up the ladder
diagrams and the most crossed diagrams respectively in a systematic perturbation
of the intensity propagator (van der Mark et al 1988). The bistatic coeﬃcient for
the single scattering contribution for isotropic scatterers assuming normal incidence
is given by (Ishimaru, 1978, vol-1)

section and b(= n0(σs + σa)L) is the optical thickness of the slab. However for the

where σb is the single particle back-scattering coeﬃcient.

When the single scattering contribution is supressed by using an isolator (Etemad
et al 1986) and the helicity preserving channel for circularly polarized light is detected
from time invariant random media, the enhancement is exactly 2 in the weak disorder
regime (Wiersma et al 1995a). However if the detection is carried out in the linear
polarization preserving channel, the enhancement factor will always be less than 2.
This is due to the presence of single scattered events which have no time reversed
counterparts. In earlier work (Yoo et al 1990a-b, Yoon et al 1993), the contribution
of single scattering was ignored. Though Eddowes et. al. 1995 suggest that the ex-
periment must be performed with circularly polarized light, it has not been realised
that the single scattered contribution can be used to estimate the anisotropy factor.
The dependence of a (normalized to unity for isotropic lossless scatterers) with the
anisotropy factor g (obtained by varying the scatterer size), is shown in ﬁgure-1. The
cross-sections and the anisotropy factor were computed using Mie scattering theory
for spherical particles and a program based on the BHMIE code given in Bohren and
Huﬀman 1983. A value of 1.33 for the refractive index of the medium (water) and 1.41
for the refractive index of the particles (typical of tissues (Wilson et al 1995)) is used.
Note the presence of resonances for monodisperse particles in ﬁgure-1a. In ﬁgure-1b,
the cross-sections and the g factors were then averaged over a particle size dispersion
of 30% assuming a gaussian ditribution in order to mimic the experimental situation
where the particles are polydisperse . Slightly diﬀerent values of the refractive indices
did not lead to much change, as the averaging process washed all resonances present.
As one can notice, the single scattering contribution decreases sharply with the in-
crease in anisotropy and becomes very small for large anisotropy factors. The g factor
is determined by the single scattering contribution, which in turn is determined by the
theoretical enhancement in exactly the backscattered direction. Note that this pro-
cedure is valid only for polydisperse particles where the averaging process washes out
the resonances and g is almost a single valued function of γs. Figure-2 shows the theo-
retical enhancement factor with the inelastic length for a slab thickness of L = 10mm
and lt = 600µm (typical of tissues (Wilson 1995 )) for several g factors. For large
anisotropy, the enhancement factor is close to 2.0 as the backscattered intensity due
to single scattering becomes very less.
If the experimental accuracies of intensity
measurement become comparable to the single scattering contributions, it would not
be possible to estimate the g factor accurately. The enhancement factor is most af-
fected by single scattering at large absorption values and is signiﬁcantly smaller than 2.

The CBS peak shape is reasonably well described in the diﬀusion approximation
(van der Mark et al 1988, Akkermans et al 1988). Monte-Carlo based routines have
also been developed to circumvent the limitations of the diﬀusion approximation.
However the analytic expressions derived in the diﬀusion approximation for incident
plane waves are very simple to ﬁt the data and hence attractive.The Monte-Carlo ap-
proach might be better to account for ﬁnite beam eﬀects but is not necessary for our
measurement where the input beam is a few millimeters in diameter. The ﬁnite beam
eﬀects would primarily reduce the ehancement factor as there would exist light paths
that exit from outside the input beam which would not have time reversed counter-
parts. Thus these would contribute mainly to the diﬀuse background. In this work,
the expressions derived in the diﬀusion approximation for an incident plane-wave on
a slab of ﬁnite thickness, have been used (van der Mark et al 1988). Though these
expressions have been derived for isotropic scatterers, it has been shown rigorously
that a similiar expression for anisotropic scatterers in a semi-inﬁnite geometry (Akker-

5

mans et al 1988) accurately describe the coherent and diﬀuse intensities within the
backscattered cone by changing the mean scattering length (ls) in the expressions for
the CBS peak shape to the mean transport length (lt).

∼

It is essential to observe the eﬀects of absorption on the CBS peak. The main
eﬀect of absorption is a rounding of the central cusp of the peak in an angular range
λ/√ltli. This corresponds to the extinction of the longer path lengths greater
θa
than √ltli due to the absorption. The other eﬀect of absorption is to trivially reduce
the enhancement factor because the single scattering events become relatively more
important as absorption increases. The CBS peak is also rounded by the convolu-
tion with the instrumental response function and unless the angular range θa of the
rounding due to absorption is larger than the instrumental resolution, the absorption
would not be measurable accurately. For the case of θa = 0.18mrad the experimental
resolution, λ = 0.6328µm and lt = 670µm a minimum value absorption coeﬃcient
0.6cm−1 can just be discerned. Though much smaller absorption coeﬃcients in
α
principle can be measured by improving the angular resolution, even assuming ideal
optics, the resolution eventually is limited by diﬀraction due to the ﬁnite beam size.
For our beam size of 5.5 mm, a beam divergence (θd = λ/πR where R is the beam ra-
dius) of about 75µrad is present yielding a minimum measurable α of about 0.1cm−1
at a lt of 700µm. Trying to increase the beam size further is impractical due to
problems of inhomogeneity of tissue samples. Hence accurate information would be
possible only for samples with moderate absorption (α > 1cm−1). However this is by
no means a fundamental limit of the technique and depends on the transport length
of the sample and the resolution of the experimental setup.

∼

3. Experimental setup and procedures

The experimental setup used is schematically depicted in ﬁgure-3. A 5mW He-Ne laser
at 632.8nm was expanded to a beam diameter of 5.5 mm and collimated to diﬀraction
limit. The collimation was checked by shear interferometry. Following the standard
practice, the CBS light was viewed through a non-polarizing 50-50 beam-splitter with
a small wedge. A computer controlled CCD array (752 X 244 pixels, model EDC-
1000HR, Electrim corporation, U.S.A) was placed at the focal plane of a positive lens
with a focal length of 20 cm, to analyze the angular peak. Each pixel on the CCD
in this conﬁguration corresponds to 0.06mrad. The laser beam was linearly polarized
by placing a polarizer just before the beam-splitter. Another polarizer was placed in
front of the CCD to record images in the polarization preserving channel. An aper-
ture slightly larger than the input beam was placed just behind the beam-splitter to
avoid ghost images from the AR coated surface of the beam-splitter. The free beam
going through the beam-splitter was carefully damped using ND ﬁlters. Wiersma et al
(1995b) enumerates in detail the common experimental artifacts and describes a setup
in which the slight angle dependent transmission and polarization properties of the
beam-splitter are eliminated. In our case as the peaks are very narrow (
1mRad)
such corrections for beam-splitter transmission are not necessary. It is known that
internal reﬂection due to the index mismatch at the surface can cause dramatic nar-
rowing of the CBS peaks (Lagendijk et al 1989, Freund and Berkovits 1990). For our
case of milk-glass interface, assuming an eﬀective refractive index of 1.38 for the milk
we get an average reﬂectivity of 13%. This would lead to an narrowing of the CBS

∼

6

peak by about 10% and hence the obtained lt values would be overestimated by the
same amount due to index mismatch.

The setup was aligned by placing a mirror in place of the sample and making the
reﬂected beam go back into the laser. The beam transmitted by the beamsplitter and
focussed by the lens was scanned by the CCD at the focal plane and the intensity pro-
ﬁle so obtained was used as the resolution curve characterizing the system response.
This was well described by a gaussian having a FWHM of 0.17 mrad. The tissue
phantom used was commercially available boiled and skimmed milk. The concentra-
tion of the milk was varied by adding distilled water. To prepare samples with diﬀerent
absorptions, the milk was doped with known concentrations of methylene blue dye.
Methylene blue is a water soluble dye having a broad absorption band in the red region
with two peaks at 610nm and 664nm The extinction coeﬃcient of the methylene blue
solutions which were added to the milk, was measured by a Shimadzu spectrophotome-
ter. The dye-doped colloids thus had a well determined inelastic length. The milk
did not change its scattering properties measurably in a time of about 3 hours. This
was conﬁrmed by recording the CBS proﬁles at diﬀerent times and comparing them.
All the experiments were hence carried out on the same milk sample within this time
frame. The tissue phantom was taken in a cuvette of 10mm path length. It was placed
slightly tilted to the incident beam so that the specular reﬂection was well away from
the backscattered direction. The Brownian motion of the milk particles caused an
ensemble average over the speckle and sharp symmetric peaks were observed. CBS in-
tensities for samples of diﬀerent scatterer concentration and absorption were recorded.

The CBS peaks from milk suspensions were very sharp (FWHM

1mrad) and
consequently aﬀected by the ﬁnite instrumental response. Hence in order to ﬁt the
parameters, the theoretical proﬁles were ﬁrst convolved with the system resolution
curve using FFT routines. The resulting curve was then least squares ﬁtted to the
experimental points treating lt, li and γs as parameters to be ﬁtted using standard
NAG library routines. Deconvolution of the experimental points was avoided as this
was found to be a noisy process.

∼

To supplement the CBS measurements,

independent measurements of the
transport parameters were made by measuring the transmission of light through milk
solution as a function of the optical thickness or the concentration of milk. The milk
was taken in a cuvette of 5mm path length. A 2mW He-Ne laser was used as the
source. The light exiting at the back of the cuvette was imaged onto a photodiode,
whose signal was detected by a lockin ampliﬁer controlled by a computer. A separate
photodiode was used to simultaneously record the laser intensity ﬂuctuations. We
have also undertaken angle-resolved scattering measurements for estimating the value
of the anisotropy factor at the same wavelength. The sample was taken in a 1.0
mm cylinderical cuvette and is diluted enough, so as to get into the single scattering
regime. The transmission of the sample was coupled to the PMT through an optical
ﬁbre kept on a rotatable stage such that the distance from the sample to the ﬁbre
tip does not change and is read by a digital storage oscilloscope. A reference detector
monitored the laser intensity ﬂuctuations. Measurements were avoided in the lower
angle region upto 8 degrees.

4. Results

Figure-4 shows the CBS proﬁles obtained from two diﬀerent concentrations of milk.
The solid lines shown are the best ﬁts to the corresponding experimental points. As
expected the CBS proﬁles became narrower with increasing transport length. The en-
hancement factor for the sample with longer transport length is considerably reduced
due to the eﬀect of convolution with the system response. The ﬁts are quite good with
a ﬁgure of merit (χ2/N where N is the number of degrees of freedom for the ﬁt) of
about 1.2. The variation of the inverse of the transport length with the concentration
is shown in the inset of ﬁgure-4. The l
increases linearly with concentration as ex-
pected. The transport length is well deﬁned and the numerical routines used quickly
5% in a few iterations. However for
converge to the correct value to an accuracy of
the plain milk solutions any absorption coeﬃcient less than 1.5cm−1 could be ﬁtted
with marginal changes in the transport length. This is because the intensity measure-
ment accuracy is limited to about 3% by the CCD noise and the changes in the proﬁle
caused by small amounts of absorption are of the same level.

Using the best ﬁtted values of γs, the enhancement factors of the deconvolved
curves are found to be in the range of 1.82 to 1.86. Thus the reduction in the en-
hancement factor is lesser than the case of isotropic scatterers in a ﬁnite slab of same
thickness with the same lt and li for which the theoretical enhancement factors are
between 1.76 to 1.80. These values are in agreement with those reported by Wolf et
al (1988), but as observed by them the reduction in the enhancement factor appears
much too large for such forward scattering media. Other processes such as recurrent
multiple scattering (Wiersma et al 1995a) which reduce the enhancement are not im-
portant at such large mean free paths used here. In spite of our best eﬀorts, higher
enhancements were not observed. The CBS peak from a piece of white paper with a
broad peak (FWHM of 10mRad) was observed to have an enhancement of only about
1.85 before deconvolution. Hence one is drawn to the conclusion that stray scatter-
ing from optical surfaces, dust and aggregates cause an additional component to the
background and lower the observed enhancements. The lowering of the enhancement
factor could also be caused by the ﬁnite beam eﬀects and the gaussian inttensity pro-
ﬁle of the laser beam. However we do not believe this to be the reason as the beam
size is reasonably large (5.5 mm FWHM
10lt). Using the equation(60) of Jakeman
∼
(1988) for Gaussian beams, we estimate that the reduction in the enhancement factor
can only be in the range of 0.01 to 0.04 for the diﬀerent lt used. Hence it appears from
the above that the single scattering contribution cannot be estimated from a single
measurement. We will return to this point at a later stage.

Figure-5 shows the CBS intensity obtained from dye-doped milk with a pre-
determined absorption coeﬃcient of 5 cm−1. The ﬁtted curve is for an absorption
coeﬃcient of 5.2cm−1 and the elastic transport lengths are within reasonable varia-
tion for the pure milk (lt = 625µm) and the absorbing sample (lt = 670µm). At
higher absorption, the entire peak appears broadened because the angular range of
0.6mrad while the peak width itself is of the same order.
the rounded cusp is θa
Also the height of the peak seems to be relatively unaﬀected by the absorption even
though the weight of single scattering in enhanced. This counter-intuitive behaviour
occurs because of the decreased eﬀect of the instrumental response on the broader
peak compared to that of the lower absorption narrow peak. This is clearly brought

∼

8

out in ﬁgure-6 where the theoretical shape (assuming same γs as from experiment)
for an inﬁnite resolution is plotted. The high absorption peak clearly shows a lower
enhancement. Thus the ﬁnite resolution and the relative weight of single scattering
act in opposite directions on the enhancement factor with increasing absorption. The
inset in Figure-5 shows the CBS proﬁle and the theoretical ﬁt from a sample with
higher absorption (α = 10cm−1). The backscattered intensity level was small neces-
sitating large exposure times, increasing the CCD noise. However the theoretical ﬁt

again correctly yielded the absorption coeﬃcient within an accuracy of
studied the CBS in dye doped milk having absorption coeﬃcients upto 30cm−1. How-
ever, the noise at these absorption levels was high (around 30 % of the peak intensity)
and would appear to limit the use of this technique to measure larger absorption co-
eﬃcients.

±

As mentioned earlier, the measured and deconvolved CBS peaks consistently
showed enhancements less than 2.0 due to experimental artifacts. This prevented
the estimation of the single scattering contribution and hence the g-factor. Hence
we look for a method by which this stray scattered contribution to the intensity can
be quantiﬁed and the single scattering contribution be separated. One notes that
the contribution of the single scattered light to the diﬀuse intensity at high absorption
reduces while the contribution of the stray light scattered by the optical elements would
be sample independent. So one attempts to parametrize the additional scattering from
optics by a constant number γstray and write the observed (normalized) intensity as

I(θ, li) =

γc(θ, li) + γl(θ, li) + γs(θ, li) + γstray
γl(0, li) + γs(0, li) + γstray

Figure-7 shows the enhancement factor (
) of the deconvolved best ﬁts (for inﬁnite
×
resolution) of the measured CBS peaks for diﬀerent values of the inelastic length. Now
we attempt to best ﬁt these points by a smooth curve for a constant parameter γstray.
This attempt yields a value of σb
0.27 ( γs = 0.03 and γl = 1.78).
0.1 and γstray
We also show the attempted ﬁt by the dotted line, for γstray = 0 (i.e., assuming no
stray scattering or other artifacts) and a g-factor of 0.06 corresponding to σb
0.85
.
It can be seen from ﬁgure-2, all such curves for diﬀerent g with γstray = 0 are
essentially parallel and none of them would ﬁt the experimental points well. This con-
ﬁrms our suspicion that the lowered enhancements are due to experimental artifacts
arising from stray scattering. From this value of σb
σs = 0.1 and ﬁgure-1, one obtains
a value of about 0.55 for g. It is to be noted that at higher values of g(> 0.6), the
change in the single scattering contribution becomes much smaller than the constant
contribution of gammastray. So detection of these changes would require far better
accuracies than permitted by our detector. All that we can conclude in this case is
that the anisotropy factor is greater than 0.55. However for smaller g values, it should
be possible to accurately determine g.

σs ∼

The transport properties can also be obtained from the plot of transmission versus
the optical thickness (Ishimaru 1978, Vol.2,Ch.14). The results of the transmission
measurements through milk-water suspension is shown in ﬁgure-8. At low densities
(region A), the transmission falls exponentially depending on the extinction coeﬃcient,
the slope of the logarithmic transmittance being given by σs +σa. In the multiple scat-
tering domain (region B), the transmission falls inversely with concentration or optical
thickness. At large optical thickness or concentration (region C), the transmission falls

9

exponentially depending on the absorption coeﬃcient. The slope of the logarithmic
transmittance is σa in this region. These yield a value of the scattering length (ls) of
130µm and an absorption coeﬃcient of 1.6cm−1 for milk at the largest concentration
used. As it can be noticed the absorption coeﬃcient lies just in the region where the
CBS proﬁles become insensitive to absorption. It must be remarked here that the
absorption coeﬃcient measured by Yoon et al (1993) is about an order of magnitude
less. Using a value of lt = 470µm obtained from the CBS measurements for this con-
centration and ls = 130µm from the transmission experiment, a value of g = 0.74 is
obtained which appears reasonable for such forward scattering media. It also conﬁrms
our suspicion that the measurement accuracy in the CBS experiment is not suﬃcient
to estimate g above 0.5 to 0.6. The inset in Figure-8 shows the angle-resolved scat-
tering data, together with a theoretical ﬁt to the Henyey-Greenstein function (solid
line). The ﬁt yielded a value of about 0.70 for the anisotropy factor (g) with an error
of about 5-7%.

5. Conclusions

∼

In conclusion, we have investigated the application of Coherent backscattering to
measure the light transport parameters in tissues using tissue phantoms (milk and
dye doped milk), paying particular attention to the limitations of the technique. This
method yields very good estimates of the transport length but it cannot be used to
estimate the inelastic length when the absorption of the sample is small (α < 1.0cm−1)
for the long transport length typical of tissues. The maximum measurable absorption
30cm−1) with our setup appears to be limited by the sensitivity and
coeﬃcient (α
noise levels of the detector used. The use of cooled intensiﬁed CCDs will permit the
measurement of much larger absorption coeﬃcients than attempted here and will also
provide much higher accuracies to determine g. Alternatively a photomultiplier tube
(PMT) based mechanical microscanner can be used with lockin detection techniques
to improve the noise levels. Improved accuracy at these long lt could also be obtained
by the Heterodyne detection technique of Pitter et al (1998) to measure the CBS.
It has been pointed out that in principle this technique can also be used to measure
the anisotropy factor(g) by estimating the single scattering contribution to the angle
independent diﬀuse intensity. It has been shown that experimental artifacts such as
scattering from optical surfaces do not allow the determination of this γs in a sin-
gle measurement and a study of the enhancement factor with g had to be carried
out to separate this artifact and determine g. However the determination of g above
0.6 is limited again by the noise levels of the detector used. Using the value of the
transport length obtained from CBS measurements and scattering length from trans-
mission measurements a value of 0.74 has been obtained for the anisotropy parameter
of milk. This value is conﬁrmed independently by angle-resolved scattering measure-
ment where a value of 0.70 is obtained.

Figure Captions

Figure-1 : Plot of the ratio of the backscattering cross-section(σb) to the total scat-
tering cross-section(σs) as a function of the anisotropy factor (g)(normalized to unity
for isotropic scattering. These quantities were calculated using Mie scattering theory
for homogeneous spheres. Figure-1a is for monodisperse particles and ﬁgure-1b shows
the dependence averaged over a particle size distribution of 30%.

Figure-2 : Computed CBS enhancement factors (for inﬁnite resolution) with inelastic
length for diﬀerent g values. These curves are drawn for a transport mean free path
lt = 600µm and a slab thickness of L = 10mm.

Figure-3 : Experimental set-up for observing the coherent backscattered light. L1-L3
: lenses; M : mirror; A1,A2 : apertures; P1, P2 : polarizers; BS : beam-splitter; BD :
beam-dump; S : sample.

Figure-4 : Measured CBS intensities for milk of two diﬀerent concentrations. The
solid lines are the calculated ﬁts to the corresponding experimental points. The ﬁtted
proﬁles are for an inelastic length (li) of 15000µm and 13000µm respectively. The
inset shows the variation of inverse of transport length with the concentration.

Figure-5 : CBS proﬁles from methylene blue doped milk for diﬀerent absorption
coeﬃcients. Solid lines are the calculated best ﬁts to the corresponding experimen-
). The inset shows
tal points with the transport lengths of 670µm(
10cm−1 and
the CBS proﬁle from dye doped milk at higher dye concentration (α
lt = 630µm).

Figure-6 :The CBS intensities of the best-ﬁts in ﬁgure-4 for an inﬁnite resolution.
The enhanced weight of the single scattering contribution for the sample with higher
absorption resulting in lower enhancement is clearly seen.

for diﬀerent inelastic lengths. The solid curve is a theoretical ﬁt with g = 0.4 and a
constant stray light scattering contribution γstray = 0.3. The dotted curve shows the
attempted ﬁt assuming no experimental artifacts γstray = 0 and yields a g of 0.03.

Figure-8 : Variation of the transmittance of milk as a function of the eﬀective op-
tical thickness of milk-water solution. The exponential ﬁts in regions A and C are
shown. The slopes of the logarithmic transmittances are 8.01 and 0.16 and yield
values of 130µm for the scattering length and 1.6cm−1 for the absorption coeﬃcient
respectively, at the largest concentration of the milk. Inset shows the angle resolved
scattering data. The solid line is a theoretical ﬁt to the Henyey-Greenstein function
giving a value of 0.7 for g.

Abstract. We study energy deposition by light nuclei
in tissue-like media
taking into account nuclear fragmentation reactions, in particular, production of
secondary neutrons. The calculations are carried out within a Monte Carlo model
for Heavy-Ion Therapy (MCHIT) based on the GEANT4 toolkit. Experimental
data on depth-dose distributions for 135A-400A MeV 12C and 18O beams are
described very well without any adjustment of the model parameters. This gives
conﬁdence in successful use of the GEANT4 toolkit for MC simulations of cancer
therapy with beams of light nuclei. The energy deposition due to secondary
neutrons produced by 12C and 20Ne beams in a (40-50 cm)3 water phantom
is estimated to 1-2% of the total dose, that is only slightly above the neutron
contribution (∼1%) induced by a 200 MeV proton beam.

1. Introduction

Using charged particles from accelerators for cancer treatment was ﬁrst proposed by
R.R. Wilson (Wilson 1946), who noticed that protons and light nuclei have a unique
property of delivering maximum dose at the end or their range in matter (Bragg
peak). The centenary of the Bragg’s discovery of a sharp peak in the depth-dose
curve for alpha particles in air (Bragg 1905) was celebrated recently, in particular,
by publishing a dedicated paper (Brown and Suit 2004). The precise localization of
high doses in the region of the Bragg peak suits well the aim of killing cancer cells in
deeply-sitting localized tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissues. This aim
cannot be achieved with the conventional radiotherapy using ionizing gamma, electron
or neutron irradiations which all are characterized by a broad depth-dose distribution
without any sharp maximums.

Only a few decades after the Wilson’s proposal, in the sixties, the advancements
in accelerator techniques made possible a wide use of the proton beams for therapeutic
purposes (Archambeau et al 1974, Orecchia et al 1998).
In the seventies alpha-
particles (Castro et al 1997, Nowakowski et al 1991) and neon ions (Linstadt et
al 1991, Castro et al 1994) were ﬁrst used for patient treatments.
In the last ten
years remarkable results were obtained in cancer therapy with carbon ions at the
Gesellschaft f¨ur Schwerionenforschung GSI (Schulz-Ertner et al 2004, Kr¨amer et al

Neutrons from fragmentation of light nuclei: GEANT4 study

2003) in Germany, and at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences at HIMAC
facility (Tsujii et al 2004) in Chiba, Japan.

As concluded by Tsujii et al (2004), carbon-ion beams provide physical and
biological advantages over photons. Heavy ions propagating through the tumor
produce much higher local density of secondary electrons as compared with photon
and even proton irradiation (Kraft 2000, Kraft et al 1999, Brons et al 2003). This
enhances the mortality of cancer cells. The accumulated positive experience made
possible the creation of the ﬁrst European dedicated medical center for proton, helium-
and carbon-ion therapy in Heidelberg (J¨akel et al 2003).

After the advantages of heavy ions in killing tumor cells are clearly demonstrated,
the next important step is to work out the methods for precise delivery of high doses to
tumors while minimizing irradiation of normal tissues. Developing eﬃcient treatment
procedures requires joint eﬀorts of physicists, biologists, medical doctors, accelerator
engineers and computer experts. It is obvious that a common computational tool is
needed for exchanging information and accumulating experience obtained by diﬀerent
hadron and heavy-ion therapy centers.

Up to now mostly deterministic methods were used by diﬀerent groups for dose
calculations in hadron therapy treatment planning, see e.g. Hong et al (1996), Kr¨amer
et al (2000), J¨akel et al (2001). They use empirical information about various
processes, for instance fragmentation cross sections (Schardt et al 1996, Sihver et
al 1998), to calculate the depth-dose distributions for speciﬁc treatment conditions.
Therefore, these deterministic methods can not be easily extended for calculating the
doses in irradiation conditions diﬀerent from those where the experimental data were
taken and ﬁtted. For example, the one-dimensional computer codes developed for
proton therapy can not be immediately used for heavy-ion treatment planning. The
important advantages of deterministic methods consist in their relative simplicity and
low computational time.

Alternatively, several three-dimensional Monte Carlo approaches are available
now which can be used for particle transport calculations in highly inhomogeneous
human tissues with air caverns and bones. The lateral scattering of beam particles
as well as production and transport of secondary particles can be easily taken into
account in such calculations. The Monte Carlo approach was implemented in PETRA
(Medin and Andreo 1997) and PTRAN (Berger 1993) codes, which are dedicated to
the simulation of proton transport in tissue-like media, with beam energies of interest
for cancer therapy. Several general-purpose Monte Carlo transport codes were tested
for dose calculations from proton beams (Fippel and Soukup 2004, Paganetti and
In these evaluation

studies VMCpro (Fippel and Soukup 2004), FLUKA (Fass´o et al 2000), GEANT3
(Goosens and Giani 1994) or GEANT4 (Agostinelli et al 2002) codes were used. In
particular, the role of nuclear interactions of primary and secondary particles in proton
therapy was studied by Paganetti (2002) by using the GEANT3 code.

A detailed review of the transport codes capable to describe the propagation and
fragmentation of heavy ions in extended media was given recently by Gudowska et al
(2004). The results of the SHIELD-HIT code (Gudowska et al 2004) were presented
in details. The authors conclude that their code describes well most of the presently
available experimental data and thus can be used for Monte Carlo simulations of heavy-
ion therapy. Another particle and heavy ion transport code PHITS was modiﬁed
recently (Nose et al 2005) to improve calculations of dose distributions in carbon
therapy. Unfortunately, both of the two codes are not publicly available. In particular,

Neutrons from fragmentation of light nuclei: GEANT4 study

as explained by Gudowska et al (2004), SHIELD-HIT code is currently under further
development and it is not available to the general user.

To the best of our knowledge, no evaluation studies on heavy-ion therapy have
been done with Monte Carlo models which are based on modern publicly available
software tools.
It seems very promising for this purpose to use a recent version
7.0 of the GEANT4 toolkit (Agostinelli et al 2002). This toolkit is widely used
in experimental high-energy and nuclear physics for simulating complicated particle
detectors (GEANT4-Webpage 2005). Recently this toolkit was updated by including
realistic models for nuclear interactions at intermediate energies of interest for heavy-
ion therapy. In this paper we apply it for simulating transport of protons, carbon,
oxygen and neon ions in tissue-like media. This approach provides a self-consistent
way for calculating the production rates of secondary nuclear fragments, protons and
neutrons as well as electrons and photons.

First, the total depth-dose distributions are calculated and compared with
experimental depth-dose curves. In contrast to most previous studies, here they are
calculated with correct absolute (not relative) normalization.

Second, we study the energy deposition due to nuclear reactions induced by
secondary nucleons and fragments, with a focus on the secondary neutrons. Our study
makes possible the direct comparison of neutron contributions to the total energy
deposition for proton and heavy-ion beams.

2. Physical models in GEANT4

In the present study we used the version 7.0 (with patch 01) of the GEANT4 toolkit
(GEANT4-Webpage 2005) to build a Monte Carlo model for Heavy-Ion Therapy
(MCHIT). In this model a tissue-like phantom, which is irradiated by proton or heavy-
ion beam, is presented by a water cube. We stress that in this paper we study the
secondary particle production only in the water phantom, and leave aside possible
nuclear reactions in the beam control elements which are usually located in front of
the phantom.

A detailed description of physical models included in GEANT4 is given in the
Physics Reference Manual (GEANT4-Documents 2005). The set of models which
are most relevant to a particular simulation problem should be activated by a user.
In order to make this selection, one can start either from the available examples of
previously developed applications, or from the so-called predeﬁned physics lists. In the
both cases speciﬁc physical processes, the low-energy neutron capture, for example,
can be activated or de-activated in a simulation via corresponding user interface
commands. The examples and predeﬁned physics lists are provided by GEANT4
developers (GEANT4-Webpage 2005) and distributed along with the GEANT4 source
code.

For MCHIT we choose the set of models called “standard electromagnetic
physics” to describe the energy losses of primary and secondary charged particles
due to electromagnetic processes. The models of ionization energy loss and multiple
scattering were activated for all charged particles. The simulations are based on
the Bethe-Bloch formula taking into account the density eﬀect and shell corrections
(GEANT4-Documents 2005).

In each simulation step the ionization energy loss of a charged particle is calculated
according to the Bethe-Bloch formula. If this energy loss is higher than a threshold for
the emission of δ-electrons (which is taken as an input parameter in the calculation)

Neutrons from fragmentation of light nuclei: GEANT4 study

4

the emission of a δ-electron is simulated.
In the opposite case the energy loss is
subtracted from the kinetic energy of the particle and then added to the calculated
local energy deposition.

One of the novel features of GEANT4 consists in the possibility for user to specify
the production thresholds in therms of secondary particle ranges in speciﬁed materials.
A relatively high cut in range of 1 mm for secondary electrons, positrons and photons
was used in simulations, that corresponds to the lowest energies 350 keV, 340 keV and
3 keV of these particles, respectively. At the same time the maximum step size in track
calculations was taken as small as 0.1 mm. The continuous local energy deposition
was calculated for each of these small steps thus providing a very detailed depth-dose
distribution. The selected options have noticeably reduced the CPU time without
aﬀecting the accuracy of calculation of the depth-dose distribution.

The bremsstrahlung processes for electrons and positrons were also activated
in the calculations along with the annihilation process for positrons. For photons,
the Compton scattering, the conversion into an electron-positron pair and the
photoelectric eﬀect were considered.

In the present evaluation study the option of low-energy electromagnetic physics
available in GEANT4 (GEANT4-Webpage 2005) was not used, although it can be
easily utilized in the future. By using the low-energy models, one can reduce the
production threshold for δ-electrons down to 200 eV. The low energy processes include
the photoelectric eﬀect, Compton scattering, Rayleigh scattering, gamma conversion,
bremsstrahlung and ionization. The ﬂuorescence of excited atoms is also considered.
The low-energy models make direct use of the atomic-shell cross section data, while
the standard calculations rely on parameterizations of these data.

GEANT4 simulations include two kinds of hadronic interactions:

(a) elastic
scattering of hadrons on target protons and nuclei, which dominate at low projectile
energies, and (b) inelastic nuclear reactions induced by fast hadrons and nuclei
(Agostinelli et al 2002). The model of nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering is based on
parameterization of experimental data in the energy range of 10-1200 MeV. The Monte
Carlo simulation of elastic scattering is quite simple, since the ﬁnal states of these
reactions are identical with the initial ones. At higher energies the hadron-nucleus
elastic scattering can be simulated within the Glauber model (GEANT4-Documents
2005).

The modeling of inelastic interactions of hadrons and nuclei requires more serious
eﬀorts. In the GEANT4 toolkit one is able to make his own choice of models to be
involved in simulations. Two groups of models are available for inelastic interactions
of hadrons: (a) the data driven models, which are based on the parameterizations
of measured cross sections for speciﬁc reaction channels, and (b) the theory driven
models, which are based on various theoretical approaches and implemented as Monte
Carlo event generators (Agostinelli et al 2002).

In the MCHIT model the inelastic interaction of low-energy (below 20 MeV)
nucleons,
including radiative neutron capture, were simulated by means of data
driven models. Above 20 MeV the exciton-based precompound model was invoked
(Agostinelli et al 2002). Finally, an intranuclear cascade model - the binary cascade
model (Folger et al 2004) was used for energies above 80 MeV for fast hadrons
and nuclei. Since exited nuclear remnants are created after the ﬁrst cascade stage
of interaction, appropriate models for describing the de-excitation process have to
be involved into simulation. The Weisskopf-Ewing model (Weisskopf and Ewing
1940) was used for the description of evaporation of nucleons from excited nuclei

at relatively low excitation energies, while the Statistical Multifragmentation Model
(SMM) (Bondorf et al 1995) was used at excitation energies above 3 MeV per nucleon
to describe multi-fragment break-up of highly-excited residual nuclei. The SMM model
includes as its part the Fermi break-up model, which describes the explosive decay of
highly-excited light nuclei.

3. Linear energy deposition of ions in water

3.1. Total depth-dose distribution

The depth-dose distribution from proton and ion beams propagating through the
tissue-like media is the most important characteristic to be considered for cancer
therapy applications. As discussed above, the beams of light nuclei (carbon or oxygen)
are very promising for this purpose.
In order to quantify the amount of energy
deposited by an ion along its track in matter, one usually considers the average
linear energy deposition dE/dx or the average linear energy transfer (LET), expressed
in MeV/mm, or keV/µm. This characteristics was calculated by splitting a cubic
phantom into thin slices and calculating the energy deposited in each of the slices.
The resulting depth-dose curves for 12C, 18O and 20Ne ions in water are presented in
ﬁgures 1,2 and 3. In the plots the calculated values are given in MeV/mm, while the
experimental data, which are usually not available in the absolute units, are rescaled
to be superimposed on the theoretical curves.

It is a well-known fact that the charged particle range in a material of a given
chemical composition is inversely proportional to the density of electrons, and hence,
to the matter density ρ. It is quite common to present the depth-dose distributions as
functions of the areal density x·ρ, since dE/dx at other density can be easily obtained
by rescaling these distributions. The depth-dose curves presented in ﬁgures 1, 2 and 3
were calculated for pure water phantoms with the water density of ρ = 1.0 g/cm3 at
40 C. Therefore, the obtained distributions numerically have the same scale in depth
x, as the distributions given in the areal density scale x · ρ expressed in g/cm2. It
was supposed that experimental distributions were obtained for pure water at 200 C
(ρ = 0.998203 g/cm2), and experimental data were appropriately rescaled.

One can conclude that the present approach based on the GEANT4 toolkit
provides a very good description of the depth-dose curves in water for 12C and 18O
ions. The shapes of distributions are well reproduced, while the peak position is
reproduced with the accuracy of 1-2 mm. One of the main calculational parameters in
the Bethe-Bloch formula, which controls the exact position of the Bragg peak, is the
average ionization potential I for the water molecule. In our simulations we ﬁx it to
I = 70.89 eV, a default value used in GEANT4, which is calculated by the appropriate
values for hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

As seen in ﬁgure 3a, the experimental depth-dose curves for 20Ne ions are
satisfactorily described only at 135A MeV, but a noticeable discrepancy between
theory and data appears at 670A MeV in ﬁgure 3b. Keeping in mind possible
uncertainties in the incoming beam energy, one can try to ﬁne-tune the beam energy
in calculations. We have found that the peak position is better reproduced with the
beam energy of 665A MeV. This is in line with the results reported by Gudowska et
al (2004), where the authors used the SHIELD-HIT code to describe the same data
and found that the experimental data are better described with the beam energy of
667A MeV.

One can note that 670A MeV 20Ne ions are less suitable for heavy ion therapy
due to increased fragmentation. Indeed, the peak value is only two times higher than
the entrance dose. This will result in higher doses in healthy tissues on the way to
deeply-seated tumors.

3.2. Fragmentation reactions

In case of heavy-ion beams it is important to study the processes responsible for
the energy deposition beyond the Bragg peak, which are entirely due to the nuclear

energy deposition was determined separately for the fragments of each charge. Our
analysis shows that due to their longer ranges, protons and alpha particles are mostly
responsible for the doses beyond the Bragg peak. The doses from heavier fragments
with Z = 4, 5 are mostly localized around the stopping point of the initial Z = 6
nuclei.

The fact that the energy deposition due to secondary fragments is peaked at
exactly the Bragg peak of primary ions (see ﬁgure 4) has a simple explanation.
Initially, when primary nuclei are still energetic enough to induce fragmentation
reactions, the ﬂux of secondary fragments grows and accordingly, their energy
deposition grows too. However, beyond the range of primary 12C ions the production
of secondary fragments stops. Therefore, the dose curves for secondary fragments fall
down after that point due to the decreasing number of such fragments.

4. Energy deposition from secondary neutrons

Neutrons as neutral particles do not lose their energy directly via ionization, but rather
via the secondary reactions involving charged hadrons. They can be produced either
in neutron elastic scattering on target nuclei or via inelastic nuclear reactions. The
mean free path of fast neutrons in matter is typically much longer as compared to the
ranges of protons of the same energy, since the protons suﬀer a direct energy loss due
to ionization of target atoms, but the neutrons do not. Therefore, the dose associated
with neutrons is expected to be distributed in a much larger volume compared to
protons.
In particular, this property of neutron beams was exploited in neutron
therapy experiments (Orecchia et al 1998).

Since the secondary neutrons can be produced in both proton and heavy-ion
irradiations, it is important to compare their eﬀects in these two cases. The role

Neutrons from fragmentation of light nuclei: GEANT4 study

9

of secondary neutrons produced in the interaction of protons with thick targets was
investigated previously in several experimental and theoretical works. As example, we
mention here some recent studies aimed at medical applications (Schneider et al 2002,
Wroe et al 2005).

Less is known about the doses from the secondary neutrons created in heavy-
ion irradiations.
In this case one can expect that the fast neutrons created in
fragmentation of projectile nuclei, the so-called spectator neutrons, provide an
additional dose as compared with the proton irradiations. In two recent experiments
(Gunzert-Marx et al 2004, Kumamoto et al 2005) neutron detectors were placed
behind the targets and the eﬀective doses and attenuation lengths in shielding
materials were measured along with the energy and angular distributions of neutrons.
The obtained information is indispensable for designing the neutron shielding for
heavy-ion therapy rooms.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no publications reporting the
doses from secondary neutrons inside the extended target or phantom in heavy-ion
irradiations. Since a measured depth-dose distribution gives the total dose, it includes
the local energy deposition from charged hadrons and nuclear fragments from neutron-
induced reactions. Due to the fact that secondary neutrons are expected to go far
beyond the Bragg peak, the dose from neutrons has to be calculated in a wider region,
i.e. outside the normal region of depth-dose measurements.

4.1. Neutron induced reactions

In contrast to fast protons and nuclear fragments, which continuously transfer their
energy to δ-electrons while propagating through the medium, neutrons lose their
energy in a more discrete way. At some points of their tracks neutrons make elastic or
inelastic hadronic interactions resulting in fast secondary protons or nuclear fragments
which thus produce ionization. This multistep mechanism of energy transfer from
neutrons to electrons explains in general the biological eﬀects of neutron radiation.

In ﬁgure 5 we present kinetic energy spectra of secondary neutrons calculated
with the GEANT4 toolkit. As seen in the ﬁgure, the spectrum of secondary neutrons
is rather wide, since several neutron production mechanisms are involved. It contains
low-energy neutrons emitted by excited target nuclei, high-energy neutrons from the
projectile evaporation as well as intermediate energy neutrons from the overlapping
parts of nuclei (ﬁreball).

Let us ﬁrst consider the neutrons produced from the target nuclei. As a rule, the
fragments of target nuclei have low velocity in the laboratory system, but they can
be highly excited. Low-energy neutrons with kinetic energies of a few MeV, typically
below 10 MeV, are produced in the de-exitation process of the remnants of target
nuclei via preequlibrium emission or evaporation. For light nuclei like 16O, the same
mechanism is in eﬀect also for protons.

Elastic scattering (including charge-exchange reactions) on target protons and
nuclei (16O) are the main processes responsible for the energy loss by low-energy
neutrons in water. In oder to estimate the relative contribution of elastic and inelastic
hadronic interactions to the energy loss of neutrons, one can calculate the energy
deposition from a monoenergetic neutron beam in a rather thick (40 cm)3 water
phantom. The results of our GEANT4 calculations are given in ﬁgure 6 for 10 MeV
neutrons.
In this case the absolute values of average linear energy deposition are
below 0.4 MeV/mm, which is less than ∼0.5% of the total energy deposition from ions

As shown in ﬁgure 6,

before the Bragg peak, see ﬁgure 4a. Nevertheless, it is at the level of a few percent
compared to the average linear energy deposition after the Bragg peak, see ﬁgure 4b.
in the case when elastic reactions are disabled, the
energy deposition from 10 MeV neutrons is essentially reduced compared to the full
calculation. On the contrary, the contribution from the radiative neutron capture
reactions 16O(n, kγ)17O with k = 1, 2, 3..., as predicted by the GEANT4 simulation,
is negligible for the 10 MeV neutron beam. When the inelastic nuclear reactions,
n +16 O → n +16 O + γ, n +16 O → n +13 C + α + γ, n +16 O → 4α + n, ... are
disabled, the attenuation of the initial neutron ﬂux is somehow reduced, leading to a
less steep fall of the depth-dose curve. However, the average energy deposition is still
comparable to the case of full calculation.

The role of secondary protons and nuclear fragments in the energy dissipation
of 10 MeV neutrons is demonstrated in ﬁgure 7. The distributions were obtained
by calculating directly the energy deposition from secondary protons and nuclear
fragments separately for each particle charge. The sum of such contributions is nearly
identical to the total energy deposition with a small diﬀerence originating from the
contribution of fast secondary electrons. As seen in ﬁgure 7a, secondary Z = 1
fragments (mostly protons) are responsible for 80-90% of the energy deposition of
10 MeV neutrons. The contribution from recoiling 16O nuclei from elastic neutron
scattering and the contribution from 12C and 4He fragments created in neutron-
induced 16O dissociation reactions are much smaller. They are shown in ﬁgure 7b.

As seen in ﬁgure 6, the average linear energy deposition of 10 MeV neutrons
is decreasing with increasing depth in water. Low-energy neutrons transfer their
kinetic energy to recoil protons and nuclei. These slow charged particles have ranges
of few millimeters in water, and the calculated energy deposition simply reﬂects the

attenuation of the ﬂux and energy of primary neutrons propagating through the water.
Fast neutrons, with energies close to the beam energy per nucleon, originate from
the projectile fragmentation reactions. The mechanism of their energy deposition in
water is diﬀerent from one for low-energy neutrons, as demonstrated in ﬁgure 8 for
330 MeV neutrons. The average linear energy deposition is increasing with the depth
in phantom, because the secondary protons and nuclear fragments have long ranges in
water, comparable to the phantom size, and they stop far from the production point.
In other words, a fast neutron create a kind of particle shower, which needs some
space for its development. In addition, the cross sections for neutron interaction with
protons and nuclei are generally lower at 330 MeV compared to 10 MeV neutrons.
Therefore, the attenuation of the neutron ﬂux is less pronounced at distances up to
40 cm shown in the ﬁgure 8.

When the elastic scattering on target protons and oxygen nuclei is neglected,
the energy deposition of 330 MeV neutrons is only slightly reduced compared to the

energy deposition is reduced dramatically. Therefore, the neutron-induced inelastic
reactions with oxygen nuclei are responsible for the main part of energy deposition of
fast spectator neutrons.

The contributions to the dose from secondary protons and nuclear fragments for
330 MeV neutron beam are shown in ﬁgure 9. Again, the distributions were obtained
by calculating directly the energy deposition from secondary protons and nuclear
fragments separately for each particle charge.

As seen in ﬁgure 9a, the Z = 1 fragments (mostly protons) are also responsible

are produced mainly in inelastic neutron-induced nuclear reactions. Several protons
can be produced in a single neutron-induced reaction on 16O. The transfer of neutron
energy to more heavy fragments of oxygen nuclei with Z = 2 − 8 is less eﬃcient
and leads to much lower energy deposition via these fragments compared to protons,
see ﬁgure 9b. The absolute values of energy deposition from 330 MeV neutrons are
approximately twice as large compared with 10 MeV neutrons, but still less than ∼1%
of the energy deposition from primary ions before the Bragg peak, see ﬁgure 4a for
comparison.

As follows from ﬁgures 6 and 8, despite the energy depositions of low- and high-
energy neutrons are comparable, the spatial distributions of corresponding doses are
very diﬀerent. The low-energy secondary neutrons produced by proton or heavy-
ion beams deposit their energy in the vicinity of a primary track. On the contrary,
secondary high-energy neutrons deposit energy in a large volume, which is comparable
to the phantom size, but their number is low.

4.2. Comparison of neutron-induced doses in proton and heavy-ion irradiations

After the mechanisms of energy dissipation of monoenergetic neutrons in water are
clariﬁed, one can directly compare the role of secondary neutrons in proton and heavy-
ion irradiations. We consider three typical irradiation setups: (I) 200 MeV protons
in (40 cm)3 water cube, (II) 330A MeV 12C ions in (40 cm)3 water cube and (III)
670A MeV 20Ne ions in (50 cm)3 water cube. These cases reﬂect typical distances in
human body, since the ranges of beam particles are ∼ 26 cm, ∼ 20 cm and ∼ 37 cm,
respectively. Therefore, 25%-50% of water thickness is beyond the Bragg peaks that
represents schematically healthy tissues where the irradiation is undesirable.

Three sets of calculations have been performed:

(1) calculations with
electromagnetic
interactions and
fragmentation reactions, (2) full calculations with hadronic interactions activated for

without hadronic

interactions only,

i.e.

all hadrons, and (3) calculations with hadronic interactions activated for all hadrons
except neutrons. In the last case secondary neutrons are allowed to leave the phantom
freely without interactions.

The calculation results for the fraction of beam energy deposited in phantoms are
presented in table 1. Since the secondary nucleons and nuclei are not produced in the
case (1), the beam energy is completely deposited in the phantoms. This ﬁrst case
can be also considered as a test demonstrating the accuracy of the methods used.

Table 1.
GEANT4 results for cubic water phantoms irradiated by 200
MeV protons, 330A MeV carbon and 670A MeV neon ions. The fraction of
beam energy deposited in phantoms (in %%) is given (1) for calculations with
only electromagnetic processes included, (2) for calculations with all processes
included, (3) for calculations with all hadronic and fragmentation processes
included, but without interactions of secondary neutrons. The fraction of beam
energy deposited due to the interactions of secondary neutrons is given as the
diﬀerence between rows (2) and (3). The last row shows the neutron doses divided
by the total doses deposited in phantom and by the average RBE of proton (1.1)
and heavy-ion (3.0) beams.

ions more than 30% of the beam energy is taken away by secondary particles, mostly
protons, as they have longer ranges in water compared to nuclear fragments.

As shown in table 1 for the case (3), the omission of neutron interactions in our
MCHIT calculations leads to only a slight decrease of the energy deposited in the
phantoms. One can estimate the energy deposition due to secondary neutrons as the
diﬀerence between the cases (2) and (3). For incident protons, carbon and neon ions
the contributions from secondary neutrons are 0.99%, 1.12% and 1.45% of the beam
energy, respectively. The same characteristic for 200A MeV carbon beam irradiating

a 12.78 cm water phantom was indirectly estimated by Gunzert-Marx et al (2004) at
the level below 1%, which is in good agreement with the present GEANT4 results.

As demonstrated by Kraft (2000) and Kr¨amer et al (2003), the relative biological
eﬀectiveness (RBE) of the carbon ions is in the range of 2-5 compared to 1.0-1.1 for
protons (Paganetti et al 2002a). This means, in particular, that the physical dose
delivered by the 12C beam to a patient should be accordingly smaller, as well as the
physical dose from the secondary neutrons. This point is illustrated in the last row
of table 1, where the neutron contributions are given relative to the total doses in
phantom and after the division by the corresponding RBE.

Comparison with other codes can be made for the case of proton beams only. The
results of PETRA (Medin and Andreo 1997), PTRAN (Berger 1993) and SHIELD-HIT
codes for water phantom irradiated by 200 MeV protons were presented by Gudowska
et al (2004). The integrated energy losses under the depth-dose distributions are 189.6
MeV (PETRA), 188.9 MeV (PTRAN) and 188.3 MeV (SHIELD-HIT). Our result for
200 MeV protons (case (I)) obtained with MCHIT is 188.96 MeV, that is in very good
agreement with the predictions of other codes (Gudowska et al 2004).

5. Conclusion

Due to prominent advances in computer technology, there exists increasing interest in
using Monte Carlo methods for heavy-ion therapy simulations. The option of using
the GEANT4 toolkit (version 7.0) for this purpose was investigated in the present
evaluation study. We have composed a new GEANT4 application, MCHIT, which
includes consistently all the major processes relevant to heavy-ion propagation in
tissue-like media. We have demonstrated that the set of experimental data on the
depth-dose distributions of 12C, 18O and 20Ne ions in water is generally well described
by the MCHIT model based on the GEANT4 toolkit . This is very promising in the
view of possible applications of Monte Carlo methods for the treatment planning in
heavy-ion cancer therapy.

The present study was focused on the energy deposition from nuclear reactions
induced by secondary neutrons. It is demonstrated that neutron-induced ionization
processes due to secondary protons and nuclear fragments contribute not more than
1-2 % of the total energy deposited in a (40-50 cm)3 water phantom, depending on
the beam energy, the charge and mass of beam ions and the phantom size. A similar
contribution was estimated for a proton beam irradiation.

It is important, however, that due to the higher RBE of ion beams, the physical
dose from secondary neutrons should be smaller than for proton beams. Our main
conclusion is that additional neutrons produced by heavy-ion beams compared to
proton beams do not appear to be a serious hazard to human body.

The distributions of positron emitting nuclei, radial distributions of energy
deposition and detailed analysis of ion fragmentation reactions will be presented
in subsequent papers. Also, we are planning to estimate the doses from secondary
neutrons produced on beam control elements and in highly inhomogeneous human
tissues.

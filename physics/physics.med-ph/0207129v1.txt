Abstract

We present NMR measurements of the diﬀusion of hyperpolarized 3He in the human
lung performed at ﬁelds much lower than those of conventional MRI scanners. The
measurements were made on standing subjects using homebuilt apparatus operating
at 3 mT. O2-limited transverse relaxation (T2 up to 15-35 s) could be measured
in-vivo. Accurate global diﬀusion measurements have been performed in-vivo and
in-vitro. 1D ADC mapping with high SNR demonstrates the real possibility of
performing quality lung imaging at extremely low ﬁelds.

Key words: Hyperpolarised helium; Lung imaging; Diﬀusion; ADC.

1 Introduction

The ﬁrst demonstrations of very low ﬁeld MRI using a hyperpolarized noble
gas were done about four years ago, ﬁrst in glass and plastic cells [1], and
subsequently in excised rat lungs [2]. These measurements were performed at
∼ 2 mT with a homebuilt instrument, and showed, in convincing fashion, the
feasibility of generating MR images with hyperpolarized gas (HG) in mag-
netic ﬁelds that are otherwise far too weak to have produced a useful thermal
Boltzmann polarization. There are many possible uses for this technique in-
cluding medical imaging. In this paper we present a realization of this idea

through the ﬁrst measurements of the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (ADC) of
hyperpolarized 3He in the human lung at very low ﬁeld (3 mT).

The very ﬁrst use of HG to image a biological system was reported in 1994;
here, the excised heart and lungs of a mouse where imaged using hyperpo-
larized 129Xe in a commercial NMR unit operating at 9.4 T ﬁeld [3]. In-vivo
studies on the human lung began in 1996 using conventional clinical systems
operating at 0.8 T [4,5] and 1.5 T [6]. However, unlike conventional MRI, the
strong ﬁeld is not needed here to polarize the gas. Futhermore, if experimen-
tal noise is dominated by electrical losses in the body it scales linearly with
frequency [7], and because the inductive NMR signal does so as well, the sig-
nal to noise ratio (SNR) is independent of ﬁeld and there exists no beneﬁt to
performing HG imaging at high ﬁelds in that respect. This was conﬁrmed at
0.1 T by the research group at Orsay using a Sopha-imaging-Magnetech MRI
unit [8,9].

Still, all in-vivo HG studies reported to date have employed high ﬁeld mag-
nets designed for proton imaging, a fact most likely due to the reason that
researchers have found it convenient for the moment to simply adopt existing
technology. The question remains, however, at which ﬁeld strength could HG
imaging prove itself most useful for medical diagnostics and will this warrant
the development of specialized HG scanners? From this point of view, there
are several compelling arguments to investigate very low ﬁeld (< 0.1 T) HG
imaging. We list them here as the underlying motivation for the seminal work
presented in this paper.

a) Field Independent SNR - As mentioned, there is no reduction in SNR at
lower ﬁelds if RF losses in the body dominate the noise. However, below some
frequency the body becomes transparent to the RF and the Johnson noise of
the detection coils will subsequently dominate. Coil-dominated noise depends
on the ﬁeld as B1/4 [7], so one expects the SNR to vary as B3/4 at very low
ﬁelds. The frequency at which this cross-over occurs has yet to be established
experimentally. One should note, however, that a lower than optimal SNR will
not necessarily preclude operation in the very low ﬁeld regime, as there may
exist a desirable trade-oﬀ with the other possible beneﬁts.

b) Reduced Susceptibility Gradients - Spatial variations in tissue susceptibility
produce local ﬁeld gradients whose magnitude is proportional to the applied
ﬁeld. This can be problematic for lung imaging at high ﬁelds, where diﬀerences
of magnetic susceptibility between blood vessels, lung tissue and airspaces
produce very strong gradients.

c) Reduced Power Absorption Rate - RF power absorption rates decrease with
frequency. Therefore, operation at lower ﬁelds will allow the use of new, rapid
pulse sequences without exceeding the safety limit of 4 W/kg of absorbed

2

power.

d) Novel Detection Methods - It may be possible to develop innovative signal
detectors that oﬀer improved performance at low ﬁeld, but would otherwise be
impractical for use at high ﬁeld. Possible examples include networks of local
detectors, superconducting coils, and SQUID detectors and ampliﬁers.

e) Novel Scanner Geometries - Very low ﬁeld scanners will not require cryogen-
ics (to cool superconducting magnets) nor be encumbered by massive resistive
or permanent magnets. This will permit unparalleled ﬂexibility in scanner
design. For example, a less bulky system may allow for measurements to be
made with the subject either standing or supine, which might be of interest
in pulmonary research.

f) Low Cost, Dedicated Scanners for Pulmonary Research - There is strong
evidence that the occurrence of certain lung pathologies, such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is increasing, and that HG
imaging could provide improved diagnosis and assessment of these prevalent
aﬄictions [10]. Should the usefulness of this technique become convincingly
established, demands for time on existing conventional scanners will increase
dramatically. Very low ﬁeld, HG scanners should be relatively inexpensive to
purchase and operate, and could quickly ﬁll the demands of this new research
niche.

To move well beyond the point of conjecture and to truly examine the poten-
tial of very low ﬁeld lung imaging with hyperpolarized gas, a systematic study
of the ideas laid out above must commence. (Additional demonstrations of HG
imaging have recently been reported at 15 mT [11]). The goal of our research
here was to do begin this exploration, ﬁrst, by developing appropriate appara-
tus, and second, by performing in-vitro and in-vivo CPMG measurements [12]
using hyperpolarized 3He. The results are compared most extensively with
those made at 0.1 T [8,9], as this is the lowest ﬁeld at which the experimental
parameters associated with HG lung imaging have previously been tested.

2 Apparatus

2.1 B0 and B1 Coils

For this ﬁrst set of measurements, we have employed a previously made B0
magnet. The magnet consists of seven co-axial coils each of 144 turns of 2 mm
diameter copper wire wound on an annular aluminum frame. The relative
orientation of the coils is shown in cross-section in Figure 1. The relative

Fig. 1. Diagram of the B0 and B1 coils. The coils of the B0 magnet are shown
in cross-section: six coils (two each of mean diameter 78.0, 71.5, and 53.5 cm) are
placed symmetrically (at 22.5, 44.5, and 66.0 cm respectively) about the central
coil, which has a mean diameter of 79.5 cm. For clarity, the B1 coils are rendered
in 3-D; the corners are labeled alphabetically. All pertinent dimensions are given in
the text.

homogeneity of the B0 ﬁeld is only a few parts per thousand over a typical
lung volume (∆x∆y∆z = 15 × 15 × 30 cm3). The magnet was driven by a
standard laboratory power supply and could maintain ﬁelds up to 6 mT (for
8.7 A, 940 W) without forced cooling. The bore of the magnet is along the
vertical (Z-direction), and the entire construction is supported on an aluminum
frame (not shown) with the bottom coil being 75 cm above the ﬂoor. This
provides suﬃcient room for an average sized person to enter from below and
rest standing during measurements.

The subject stands facing the X-direction, with chest centered within the two
“C-shaped” coils (shown in Fig. 1) that generate the RF ﬁeld, B1, along the
Y-direction. These coils were wound on a PMMA frame with 11 outer turns
(wound A through H) and 9 inner turns (wound B,C,F,G). The outer sections
(AB = 15.4 cm) make a 109◦ angle with the inner sections (BC = 32.0 cm);
the height of the coils is 72 cm and they are separated from one another by
a distance AA′ = 15.6 cm. The coil was designed as an inductor to produce
an RF ﬁeld homogeneous to within 5% over a typical lung volume. (This was
conﬁrmed by mapping with a small search coil.) To avoid spurious current
paths, copper wire with a relatively thick insulating layer (1.4 mm diameter

4

wire covered by a 0.7 mm layer of plastic) was used to keep adjacent windings
well separated, thereby minimizing internal capacitance and maintaining a
suﬃciently high self-resonance of 350 kHz. The coil was tuned to the Larmor
frequency with a series capacitor to obtain a convenient low impedance (Z1 ∼
50 Ω, Q1 = 12). It was driven by a homebuilt RF ampliﬁer (with APEX PA46
operational ampliﬁers) and could produce a π-pulse at 100 kHz (B0∼ 3 mT)
in a duration of TRF = 0.8 ms. Gating and dephasing of the RF pulse were
controlled via homebuilt circuitry. The reference frequency came from the
oscillator output of an EG&G 7265 lock-in ampliﬁer, also used for NMR signal
detection.

2.2 Detection Coils

The detection system consists of four rectangular coils: two main coils (each
of ten turns and area 34 × 40 cm2) at the front and back of the chest, and two
smaller compensation coils (each of forty turns but with 1/4 the area of the
main coils) on either side of the chest. The main coils are separated by 26 cm,
the compensation coils by 50 cm. The coils were arranged symmetrically about
the center of the B1 coil, and face the X-direction perpendicular to the B1 ﬁeld.
The compensation coils were made smaller due to space limitations inside the
B0 magnet, but have the same ﬂux (i.e. area × number of turns) as the main
coils. They were added to the circuit, as sketched in Figure 2, to increase the
signal to noise ratio: the two sets of coils are connected in series, but with
opposite polarity, which suppresses external noise signals while augmenting
the internal NMR signal. To measure the 3He NMR signal, the coil system
was tuned globally to the Larmor frequency (Q = 32), and the voltage signal
was detected using the lock-in ampliﬁer with diﬀerential input.

Typical noise levels at the lock-in output are shown in Figure 3. The use of
the compensation coils reduced the background noise by a factor of 7, which
was suﬃcient to observe the desired NMR signal and make global measure-
ments of the ADC. However, to obtain the necessary resolution for regional
measurements, the entire experiment eventually had to be enclosed within a
Faraday cage. This brought a further reduction in noise by a factor of 17 as
shown in Figure 3. The shielding (0.5 mm copper sheet) was eﬀective in re-
ducing external noise sources to levels below that of the intrinsic noise of the
detection system (dominated by the Johnson noise of the coils). Under these
conditions, the SNR was slightly better without the use of the compensation
coils, as the added noise owing to their large impedance was not oﬀset by their
contribution to the signal.

nal NMR signal, which is augmented by the compensation coils, b) an external
homogeneous noise signal, which is nulliﬁed by the compensation coils.

2.3 Gradient Coil for Diﬀusion Measurements

A gradient coil was made from two pairs of anti-Helmholtz coils (two 7-turn
coils separated by 51.6 cm, and two 1-turn coils separated by 20.7 cm) wound
on the B1 coil frame. The combination of these coils produces a linear gradient
dB0/dz = 95 µT/m per Ampere. Measurements using a calibrated gradiome-
ter [14] showed the gradient ﬁeld to be homogeneous to within 5% over the
typical lung volume. The gradient coil was driven by a Kepco 50-8M bipolar
power supply with current switching times < 25 µs. Eddy-currents generated
in the aluminum frame of the B0 magnet have been observed to hamper fast
gradient switching by ∼ 15%, and to have a decay time of 800 µs. Pre-emphasis
was used to compensate for their eﬀect, and the desired gradient is obtained
to ±3% of the change after 100 µs and to ±0.5% of the change after 300 µs.

2.4 Gas Production

Production of the hyperpolarized 3He was done in-house using the technique
of metastability exchange optical pumping [15,16]. The gas was polarized at

the experiment with copper shielding (dot-dashed line).

a pressure of about 3 mbar, within a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of 0.9 mT,
using a 2W ytterbium ﬁbre laser (Keopsys YFL-1083-20). The pumping was
done in a 50 cm long optical cell. The ﬂow of gas through the cell was controlled
via the combination of a ﬂow regulator and a peristaltic compressor [17], which
is used to extract the polarized gas from the optical cell and accumulate it in
a storage cell. Typical ﬂow rates were 2 cm3 of gas at standard pressure per
minute. A polarization of 30 − 40% could be achieved in the storage cell. After
20 minutes of accumulation this gave a typical dose of 15 standard cm3 (or
670 µmol) of fully polarized 3He.

3 Method

When the gas was required for an experiment, it was pumped back via the
peristaltic compressor into a 1 liter plastic bag (a Tedlar gas sampling bag
from Jensen Inert Products) to be carried to the measurement apparatus.
High purity nitrogen was used as a neutral buﬀer gas to inﬂate the bag with
a total amount of gas usually of order 0.5 liter. The relaxation time T1 of the
gas in the bag is ∼ 20 minutes, so experiments were designed to commence
soon after this transfer had been made.

7

The extraction and transport of the gas was done in earth’s ﬁeld only, the
optical pumping ﬁeld and the NMR ﬁeld having both been switched oﬀ. Just
prior to measurement, and with the bag of gas inside the apparatus, the B0
magnet current was ramped back up. In-vitro measurements were performed in
the bag, while in-vivo measurements were performed among the authors. While
standing within the detection coils, the subject exhaled normally, inhaled the
gas directly from the bag, and then further inhaled air to completely ﬁll the
lungs. The subject was then required to hold his breath during the acquisition
time (typically 5 s or less).

All data presented in this paper were taken at 102 kHz (∼ 3 mT) using CPMG
echo sequences [12]. A 90◦
x RF pulse (TRF = 0.4 ms) was followed by a train of
180◦
y RF pulses (TRF = 0.8 ms) to refocus the transverse magnetization at a
regular interval TCP. Spatially non-selective tipping was obtained with a good
angle accuracy by switching oﬀ any applied gradient at least 400 µs before the
beginning of the RF pulses (see App. A). A PC running lab-written software
was used to manage the RF and gradient pulse sequencing, as well as to collect
data directly from the lock-in ampliﬁer via an A/D converter.

For a CPMG sequence, the transverse magnetization has a decay time T2 that
can be written as

The ﬁrst term is the inherent relaxation rate of the system, the second term
represents additional relaxation resulting from diﬀusion in a non-uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld, due to an applied ﬁeld gradient and/or the magnet inhomogeneities.
For a uniform applied gradient G, T2,diﬀ can be expressed in the case of free
gas diﬀusion as

D(γkGTCP)2

where D is the coeﬃcient of diﬀusion and the factor k corrects for the time
variation of the applied gradient, which is switched oﬀ during the RF pulses.
For a rectangular gradient pulse, this correction factor is given as

k = qδ2(3TCP − 2δ)/T 3
CP

where δ ≤ TCP is the duration of the gradient [13].

Measurements were made for diﬀerent values of TCP (3.6 to 90 ms) and applied
gradient G (0 to 660 µT/m) to extract D, either globally or regionally. For
in-vitro measurements in the bag, this should almost exactly correspond to
DHeN2, the coeﬃcient for free diﬀusion of 3He in N2 (see App. B). For in-vivo
measurements, the extracted value of D was considered an apparent diﬀusion

the lung.

4 Results

Preliminary measurements of the B0 homogeneity were made via NMR on a
sealed cell (∼ 75 cm3) of low pressure 3He gas. The use of a small set of receive
coils gave excellent SNR despite the low pressure of the gas (1 to 6 mbar). The
gas in the cell was optically polarized in-situ, which allowed the B0 ﬁeld to be
mapped with relative ease. At each position an FID was recorded following a
90◦ RF pulse; the frequency of the signal gave the local ﬁeld strength, whereas
T ∗
2 , the decay time of the FID at 1/e of its initial value, gave a measure of local
gradients. Measurements were made at ﬁelds of 6 mT and 3 mT. In both cases,
frequency measurements did correspond well with the calculated ﬁeld map of
the magnet. Furthermore, values of T ∗
2 were found to be twice as long at the
lower applied ﬁeld, which conﬁrmed that local ﬁelds and their gradients were
still dominated by the magnet at this level. To minimize residual gradients,
we chose to operate at 3 mT or less.

To display the operation of the apparatus as well as some of the characteristics
of 3He gas NMR, a collection of CPMG spin echo data is shown in Figure 4.
These measurements were made with the Faraday cage and exhibit excellent
SNR’s of 200 to 300. The repetition rate was TCP = 24.8 ms. The time axes of
the graphs are broken to accentuate the evolution of the echoes. Data shown
in the top panel were taken in-vivo with zero applied gradient, and exhibit
an echo amplitude that decays little over 300 ms. The decoherence time T ∗
2 ∼
10 ms (Full Width Half Maximum), which corresponds to a spread in frequency
of 90 Hz FWHM, is consistent with the inhomogeneity of the B0 ﬁeld over this
volume. This suggests that tissue susceptibility gradients contribute little to
the relaxation observed here. Data shown in the middle panel were taken in-
vivo with G = 380 µT/m. As a result of the strong applied gradient, the echoes
are much more narrow (shorter T ∗
2 ) and show a marked decay in amplitude
(shorter T2). Data shown in the bottom panel were taken in-vitro with G =
240 µT/m; to obtain a decay rate similar to that which was observed in-vivo,
the value of the applied gradient has to be lowered to compensate for a faster
rate of diﬀusion (see Eq. 2). This result highlights the diﬀerence between the
restricted diﬀusion of 3He inside the lung and the free diﬀusion it experiences
in the bag.

To extract values of T2 from our data, monoexponential ﬁts were made to the
square of the echo amplitudes, or the square of their Fourier components. It is
generally recognized that the use of power data (rather than the magnitudes)
yields a more reliable result [18]. For extremely long decay times, such as those

shown in Figure 5, we found that the results from various ﬁtting procedures
did not vary signiﬁcantly (this is further discussed in Sec. 4.3).

4.1 Fast Repetition CPMG with no applied gradient

Measurements made in zero applied gradient using a very short TCP = 3.6 ms
are shown in Figure 5. For such a fast repetition rate the lock-in ampliﬁer had
to be operated with lower gain which caused a slight decrease in the SNR. The
excellent homogeneity of the B1 ﬁeld allowed for the refocusing of thousands
of echoes with very little loss per RF pulse (see App. A). The extremely low
power radiated at this frequency allowed these measurements to be safely
performed in-vivo as well.

It is clear from Figure 5, that there is marked diﬀerence in decay rate between
the in-vitro (T2 ∼ 98 s) and in-vivo (T2 ∼ 17 s) results. For 3He in the bag,
the transverse relaxation at TCP = 3.6 ms would have been limited by the

losses, or a combination of both; the longitudinal relaxation, T1 ∼ 20 minutes,
was too long to have made a contribution. As shown in the inset of Figure 5,
the T2 in the bag dropped rapidly with increased TCP indicating that diﬀusion
was the dominant relaxation mechanism above TCP = 3.6 ms. By contrast, the
in-vivo T2 hovered around a much lower value (17 - 19 s for this subject, 16 -
22 s for others) before falling oﬀ at TCP around 15 ms. The T2 values in this
plateau region are comparable to the oxygen-limited T1 values (∼ 12 − 20 s)
measured for 3He in the lung by MRI at high ﬁeld [19,20]. Complementary
global measurements of T1 (decays monitored using small angle tipping pulses)
and T2 (with no applied gradient) have been performed in-vitro at 2 mT in a
diﬀerent NMR apparatus. Decay times of several minutes have been obtained
for small amounts of 3He mixed with pure N2, while T2 = T1 = 13 s were
measured for 3He in air at room pressure and temperature. This strongly
suggests that the constant T2 we observed at short TCP was indeed due to
the nominal O2 concentration in the lung. To corroborate this ﬁnding, similar
measurements were made where the subject did not inhale air following a 1-
liter bolus of HP gas. In this case, T2 values greater than 30 s and as high as
36 s were observed (for TCP = 5.8 ms), consistent with a longer T1 due to a
lower oxygen concentration.

Another strong signature of O2-induced relaxation can be seen in the main
graph of Figure 5. The decay rate in-vivo was not constant, as was seen in-

11

vitro, but instead slowed down over time as the O2 concentration in the lung
decreased. This is highlighted by the dashed line which indicates the initial
decay rate of 17 s. A full ﬁt to the data (not shown) reveals that the echo
decay rate, and hence the O2 partial pressure, decreases linearly with time.
This has also been observed by the direct measurement of the 3He T1 in the
lung [21].

4.2 Global Diﬀusion Measurements

A summary of all our diﬀusion measurements (taken with and without the
Faraday cage) is shown in Figure 6, and a comparison is made with the recently
published results of reference [9] taken at 0.1 T. The data is plotted as T2

versus ∆z = 2π/ (γkGTCP), which appears in Eq. (2) as the natural length
scale for relaxation due to diﬀusion. ∆z actually diﬀers from the usual pixel
size 2π/ (γGδ), which sets the resolution of any MR image and provides a
useful forum to discuss the results, but the two lengths have similar values in
our experiments since δ ≈ TCP.

12

It is clear from Figure 6 that results at 3 mT (closed symbols) and 0.1 T (open
symbols) exhibit the same trend: for a given value of ∆z, there is a longer T2
in-vivo owing to the restricted diﬀusion of the 3He in the small airspaces of
the lung. This is fortunate from the point of view of lung imaging, as more
time can be had to obtain the desired image resolution. To extract diﬀusion
coeﬃcients, noting that 1/T2,0 is negligible for these data, linear ﬁts (through
the origin) were made to the data of Figure 6 plotted as ∆z2 versus T2. This
procedure gives more weight to measurements with longer T2, which have a
higher SNR, and is thus preferred to a linear ﬁt of ∆z−2 versus 1/T2. For
in-vitro results, we obtained a value of 79.5 ± 1 mm2/s, in perfect agreement
with the expected free diﬀusion coeﬃcient (see App. B). This is likely to be
fortuitous since the gradient calibration is not accurate to better than 1% and
the ambient pressure and temperature were not precisely measured during the
experiments. The solid line in Figure 6 was drawn using this value to show
the theoretical response for the free diﬀusion of 3He in N2.

Using all our in-vivo measurements we obtained a value for the global ADC
in the lung of 14.2 ± 0.6 mm2/s, whereas results from reference [9] give 22 ±
1.5 mm2/s (see Tab. 1). On average our measurements give a global ADC

that is on the order of DHeN2/6.3 (the dashed line in Figure 6). In contrast
with in-vitro measurements, a large data scatter and a possible deviation from
a quadratic dependence is observed in Figure 6 for in-vivo measurements.
The small quoted statistical error on the ADC values in the lung are thus
misleading, and it is much more relevant to extract one ADC value from each
measurement, and to relate the scatter of the obtained values at a given pixel
size to physiological diﬀerences between measurements. The corresponding
results are given in the lower part of Table 1. The smallest scatter was obtained
for the set of measurements taken in the same subject with similar breathing
maneuvers (data in the Faraday cage, solid circles in Fig. 6).

4.3 Regional Diﬀusion Measurements

Each recorded echo contains information on the distribution of the polarized
gas along the applied gradient axis (here, the vertical Z axis oriented from
feet to head for a standing subject). FFTs of the spin echoes thus provide se-
ries of 1D images with a nominal resolution given by the pixel size deﬁned in
the previous section. Provided that the SNR is large enough, a pixel by pixel
analysis of the decays can be performed to obtain Z-proﬁles of the initial gas
distribution and of the local decay time. Examples of results of such analyses
are shown in Figure 7 for two in-vivo measurements performed with opposite
gradient directions. For each measurement, the ﬁtted initial amplitudes (solid

lines) and decay times are obtained from non-linear least squares (NLLS) ex-
ponential ﬁts of the power spectra (i.e. ﬁtting, for each pixel, the squares of the
amplitudes of the echoes by a single exponential decaying to the noise level).
The ﬁtted amplitude proﬁles are used to compute the actual gas distribution
proﬁles (symbols) by simply correcting for the acquisition system bandwidth
(in Fig. 7, the 395 mm ﬁeld of view (FOV) corresponds to a frequency range
of 10 kHz, while the FWHM bandwidth of the detection coil is 5.6 kHz).
The SNR in the central region of the lung with highest signal intensity is 180

14

(signal amplitude in Fig. 7 divided by standard deviation between echoes in
similar recordings without polarized gas). The noise level increases near the
edges of the FOV due to the growing inﬂuence of the ampliﬁer noise in the
bandwidth-corrected data.

A diﬀerence in proﬁles obtained for opposite directions of the applied gradient
was systematically observed in all experiments, both in-vivo and in-vitro. It is
attributed to the rather strong magnet inhomogeneities at the position of the
measurements, which result in a non-uniform value of the total gradient. It is
much weaker on the ﬁeld axis, it scales with B0 (as was checked at 1.5 mT)
and it is relatively larger at reduced applied G. Figure 7 clearly shows that an
apparent excess (resp. lack) of signal amplitude is correlated to a longer (resp.
shorter) T2 than the average: both eﬀects result from a locally decreased (resp.
increased) value of the total ﬁeld gradient. To ﬁrst order, the averages of the
values obtained from experiments performed with ±G (the ﬁlled symbols in
Fig. 7) should thus reproduce the true gas distribution proﬁle and the true T2
proﬁle which would be directly measured in a homogeneous B0 ﬁeld.

A clear non-uniform distribution of the average signal is observed in the high
intensity region, however is may result from the imperfectly compensated ef-
fects of the ±G measurements. The average T2 proﬁle is quite uniform over
most of lung (±5% over the high signal intensity region), and the observed
variations cannot be safely ascribed to actual ADC diﬀerences in spite of the
high SNR. Regional dependence of the measured ADC in the normal human
lung has been observed at 1.5 T [22], with 20% lower ADC values in the poste-
rior part of the lungs of a supine lying subject (this is attributed to the known
gravity-induced diﬀerences, e.g. of alveolar inﬂation, in the normal lung). As
is discussed in reference [9], the length scale involved in such measurements
(typically 0.3 mm) is much smaller than the length scale ∆z in a CPMG
measurement, and this may impact on the ADC values.

For all measurements performed in the Faraday cage, the high SNR allows
to perform a local ADC analysis and to apply the corrections required to
obtain local or global values of the ADC. However the reduced SNR of all
initial measurements (without the Faraday cage) prevented us from making
such corrections, and the global T2 values in Figure 6 have been computed by
NLLS exponential ﬁts of the total areas of the power spectra of the echoes. We
have checked on all high SNR data (both for +G and −G) that this procedure
actually introduces little bias (<10%) on the global T2 compared to the true
average, much less in fact that the rather large scatter of the in-vivo results.

5 Prospects

In this paper we have presented NMR measurements of 3He in the human
lung made with a simple, homebuilt system operating at 3 mT. With this
device we were able to demonstrate for the ﬁrst time some of the proposed
beneﬁts of performing HG imaging at very low ﬁeld. Using a simple wire-
wound coil, we were able to generate a B1 ﬁeld of suﬃcient homogeneity
to observe very long CPMG decay rates without being obscured by π-pulse
losses or aﬀected by tissue susceptibility eﬀects. Thanks to the full use of the
available magnetization in a CPMG experiment, this provides an accurate way
to measure the O2 concentration and its time evolution with small doses of
polarized gas. The assessment of the potential interest of these measurements,
and their extension to regional measurements must now be performed.

Good SNR was obtained in the 1D proﬁles even using modest doses of gas
and unsophisticated NMR coils. With additional gradient coils, 2D and 3D
imaging is expected to provide results similar to those already obtained in
a commercial 0.1 T apparatus [9], with the added ﬂexibility allowed by the
ultrafast RF repetition and the very long intrinsic T2. This potential to perform
quality lung imaging and accurate ADC mapping at very low ﬁeld in a standing
subject will be fully used when a dedicated B0 ﬁeld of adequate homogeneity
over the lung volume - a system rather easy to design and build - will be
operational.

A Field inhomogeneities and tipping angle accuracy

In the rotating frame synchronous with the near-resonant component of the RF
B1 ﬁeld, the magnetization tipping at a given point r results from the preces-
sion during a time TRF around the eﬀective ﬁeld Beﬀ = B0 (νRF − ν0(r)) /νRF+
B1 (r) , where ν0(r) is the local Larmor frequency and νRF the frequency of the
B1 ﬁeld. Noting Ψ the angle of Beﬀ with the Z direction (that of the average

16

B0 ﬁeld, see Sec. 2.1), the actual tip angle θ at position r is given by

cos θ (r) = cos2 Ψ + sin2 Ψ cos (γBeﬀTRF) .

(A.1)

180◦ pulses cannot be exactly obtained except at resonance (Ψ = π/2), and
the largest tip angle which can be obtained is 2Ψ for the optimal pulse dura-
RF = π/γBeﬀ. We now consider situations where imperfect 180◦ pulses
tion T opt
result from small deviations from the resonance conditions and small spatial
variations of B1. Setting the pulse duration to its optimal value for the av-
erage B1 ﬁeld (assuming resonance conditions), the tip angle computed from
Eq. (A.1) depends on position through the local values of B0 and B1 as shown
in Figure A.1.

In our experiment, the RF ﬁeld is uniform to ±3%, and γB1 = 625 Hz. The B0
ﬁeld is ramped up just before data acquisition, and the resonance condition at
the center of the apparatus is obtained with a reproducibility and a stability
of ±50 Hz. In the absence of applied gradients, the ﬁeld inhomogeneity over a
typical lung volume is estimated from FFTs of spin echoes such as in Figure 4
(top panel). The 90 Hz FWHM spread (resp. 200 Hz spread for 90% of the
spectrum area) corresponds to νRF − ν0(r) = ±45 Hz (resp. ±100 Hz). Finally,
when switched gradients are used, their residual value during the RF pulses
is lower than 0.5% of the applied value (at most ±5 kHz over a 395 mm
FOV), i.e. ±15 Hz over a lung volume. From the plots in Figure A.1, actual
angles of 170◦ (resp. 160◦) are expected for detunings of 50 Hz (resp. 100 Hz).
Since angle errors α are expected to induce a loss α4/32 for each pulse in a
CPMG sequence [23], the corresponding values for this loss are 2.9 × 10−5
(resp. 4.6 × 10−4). This is consistent with the negligible contribution from
pulse losses inferred in all our experiments, even when thousands of echoes

17

are recorded as in Figure 5.

B Value of D in several gas mixtures

The free diﬀusion coeﬃcient D in Eq. (2) depends on the gas temperature T ,
pressure P and composition. For helium, there is an additional eﬀect of the
isotopic nature. Data have been published for diﬀusion in helium based on
calculations of transport coeﬃcients for accurate potentials [24] and on NMR
measurements in 3He [25,26]. Data for binary diﬀusion of the 4He-N2 [27,28]
and 4He-O2 [28] systems have been obtained by mass-diﬀusion measurements.
Using a classical theory for transport in dilute gases [29], we provide numer-
ical formulas to compute D for a 3He gas with partial pressure P3 in a gas
containing other components (4He, N2, O2) with partial pressure P4, PN2 and
PO2, in the simple case of uniform temperature and partial pressures.

We ﬁrst evaluate the self- and binary-diﬀusion coeﬃcients of 3He, D3, D34,
D3N2 and D3O2. With notations of Reference [29],

D3 =

3
16

q2π (kBT )3 /m3
P3πσ2Ω(1,1)∗

(B.1)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, m3 the 3He atomic mass, πσ2 the collision
cross section in a rigid-sphere model and Ω(1,1)∗ a T -dependent factor depend-
ing on the actual interatomic potential. The pressure-independent reduced
diﬀusion coeﬃcient D3 = P3D3 has an apparent T 3/2 temperature dependence
(actually assumed in Ref. [26]), but this is not exact for a real gas. For helium
(3He,4He and isotope mixtures), the computed values in the 200-600 K range
[24] can be accurately reproduced (within 0.2%) by a power law Di (T ) ∝ T 1.71.
For a binary mixture in which 3He (with negligible partial pressure) diﬀuses
in another component i, D3i is given by Eq. (B.1) in which the 3He mass is
replaced by the reduced mass µ3i = m3mi/ (m3 + mi) , P3 by Pi (the foreign
gas pressure) and Ω(1,1)∗ depends on the involved interaction potential. The
reduced diﬀusion coeﬃcient D3i = PiD3i again only depends on temperature.
For N2, the values measured in the 300-800 K range [27] can be nicely ﬁt
by D4N2 (T ) ∝ T 1.65. For both N2 and O2, the ratios of the measurements of
reference [28] provide the same exponent 1.68 but this determination is less
accurate due to the small temperature interval (300 and 323 K). We thus
choose to use the same exponent 1.65 for N2 and O2. All these experimental
data have been obtained for 4He, and the faster diﬀusion of 3He can be eval-
uated using the ratio of the relevant reduced masses. This procedure provides
the corrects values within 0.1% compared to the diﬀusion of helium [24] or
helium-hydrogen [30] isotope mixtures. This results from the negligible eﬀect
of quantum statistics on the binary collisions at room temperature, and is even

18

more accurate for collisions with a heavier molecule. These isotope eﬀects and
the numerical formulas for D3(T ) and D3i(T ) are collected in Table B.1.

(B.2)

Eq. (B.2) can be applied for instance to the gas mixtures used for the in-
vitro measurements of Figure 6, for which typically 30 cm3 of 3He were mixed
to 1 liter of N2: for 1 atm at 20◦C, one obtains D = 79.5 mm2/s, slightly
larger than D3N2 = 78.1 mm2/s. Eq. (B.2) can also be applied to evaluate the
free diﬀusion coeﬃcient for typical in-vivo experiments, in which the inhaled
dose (30 cm3 of 3He mixed with 0.5 liter of N2) mixes with the subject’s lung
contents (∼5 liters of O2-depleted air, since the typical partial pressure of O2
is 0.13 atm in-vivo instead of 0.21 atm in room air). For 1 atm of this mixture
at 37◦C, one obtains D = 86.6 mm2/s. This higher value is mostly due to the
higher temperature, and to a lesser extent to the faster diﬀusion of helium in
O2.

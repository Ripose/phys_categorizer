Abstract

Regular and stochastic behavior in the time series of Parkinsonian pathological tremor velocity

is studied on the basis of the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes and

ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy. We have developed a new method of analyzing and diagnosing Parkin-

son’s disease (PD) by taking into consideration discreteness, ﬂuctuations, long- and short-range

correlations, regular and stochastic behavior, Markov and non-Markov eﬀects and dynamic alterna-

tion of relaxation modes in the initial time signals. The spectrum of the statistical non-Markovity

parameter reﬂects Markovity and non-Markovity in the initial time series of tremor. The relaxation

and kinetic parameters used in the method allow us to estimate the relaxation scales of diverse

scenarios of the time signals produced by the patient in various dynamic states. The local time

behavior of the initial time correlation function and the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter

give detailed information about the variation of pathological tremor in the local regions of the

time series. The obtained results can be used to ﬁnd the most eﬀective method of reducing or

suppressing pathological tremor in each individual case of a PD patient. Generally, the method

allows one to assess the eﬃcacy of the medical treatment for a group of PD patients.

INTRODUCTION. PARKINSON’S DISEASE

Recently, much eﬀort has been made in searching new alternative methods of diagnosing,

treating and preventing severe diseases of central nervous and locomotor systems. Among

them, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most serious illnesses. PD, was called so

by the French neurologist Pierre Marie Charcot in the 19th century to honor Dr. James

Parkinson, who ﬁrst described the disease in 1817. Dr. Parkinson presented the account of

the observation results made about six patients in his book An essay on the shaking palsy.

The present paper deals with two physical methods used in combination to analyze,

diagnose and treat PD. The possibilities of the methods are assessed and compared. The

comparison allowed us to add extra information about the behavior of PD pathological

tremor physical parameters.

The ﬁrst method is based on the notions and concepts of the statistical theory of dis-

crete non-Markov stochastic processes [1, 2]. The method is connected with the studies of

statistical non-Markov eﬀects, long- and short-range statistical memory eﬀects, regularity

and stochastic behavior eﬀects, and dynamic alternation of relaxation modes in the patient

in various dynamic states. The study of non-Markov eﬀects in complex systems in biology

[3, 4, 5, 6], physics [6, 7, 8, 9], seismology [10, 11], and medicine [2, 12, 13, 14] is of special

interest for correlation analysis. The scale of time ﬂuctuations, long-range eﬀects, discrete-

ness of various processes and states, and the eﬀects of dynamic alternation in the initial

time series are important role in this respect. The discreteness of experimental data, statis-

tical eﬀects of long- and short-range memory and the constructive role of ﬂuctuations and

correlations can be used to obtain information about the properties and parameters of the

system under study. Within this method, a set of quantitative and qualitative parameters

allows one to determine typical distinctions between the natural and aftertreatment states

of a patient, describes a detailed variation in patient’s pathological tremor, and helps to

choose the most eﬀective treatment of separate patients and statistical groups.

The second method, ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS), is a general phenomenological ap-

proach to the analysis of the behavior of complex nonlinear systems. It is designed to extract

the information contained in chaotic signals of various natures: time series, spatial series,

and complex power spectra produced by the systems. Within the FNS method, the series of

various irregularities (spikes, jumps, discontinuities of derivatives of various orders) of the

dynamic variables of a system at all levels of its temporal and spatial hierarchy are analyzed

3

to extract the information that can help to predict the behavior of the system. The use

of irregularities in the dynamic variables as the information basis or ”colors” of the FNS

methodology enables us not only to classify all the information contained in the chaotic se-

ries in the most general phenomenological form, but also to extract distinctively any desired

portion of this information. The FNS method can be used to solve three types of problems:

to determine the parameters, or patterns, characterizing the behavior or structural features

of open complex (physical, chemical, natural) systems; to determine the precursors of the

sharpest changes in the state of open dissipative systems of various natures using the prior

information about the behavior of the systems; to determine the redistribution behavior of

excitations in the distributed systems by analyzing dynamic correlations in chaotic signals

measured simultaneously at diﬀerent points.

PD is a progressing chronic brain disease manifesting itself in movement disorders. PD is

caused by complex biochemical processes accompanied by the lack of the chemical substance

dopamine. Dopamine acts as a transmitter of signals from one nervous cell to another. The

lack of the neurotransmitter dopamine causes changes in the brain parts that control human

motor functions.

The origin of PD is not clear. It is most frequently believed that this disease is caused by

a combination of three factors: biological aging, heredity and exposure to some toxins. The

major PD symptoms are hypokinesia, stiﬀness and tremor. New ideas and principles are

required to solve the problems emerging in classical treatment methods. The diagnostics of

the disease in the early stages is one of these problems. Only the joint eﬀorts of experts from

diﬀerent science areas can bring a solution to this kind of problems. For example, the modern

methods of biophysics, biochemistry and neurophysiology enabled us to make considerable

progress in understanding PD reasons and developing the methods of its treatment.

Today, there are three methods of PD treatment: medicamentous therapy, neurologic

surgery and electromagnetic stimulation of certain brain areas. To obtain a more reliable

picture of PD evolution, it is necessary to use physical methods. In this case, statistical

methods of analysis are of special importance. They are used to analyze experimental time

series of various parameters of tremor in patient’s limbs. As a rule, the experimental data

are obtained by conventional biomechanical methods [15, 16, 17] such as recording of electric

signals in leg muscles when the patient is walking [18] or by laser recording of physiological

and pathological tremor in human hands [19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

A nonlinear dynamical model is used to analyze a variety of human gaits [24]. The

4

stride-interval time series in normal human gait is characterized by slightly multifractal

ﬂuctuations. The fractal nature of the ﬂuctuations becomes more pronounced under both

the increase and decrease in the average gait [24].

Nonlinear time series analysis is applied in studying normal and pathological human

walking [18]. The problems caused by age changes in a human gait [25, 26, 27, 28], various

movement disorders and locomotor system diseases [29, 30] are studied by J. Hausdorﬀ. A

nonlinear signal, multimodal (independent) oscillations, and the periodic pattern of time

records in hand tremor and muscle activity in a PD patient are studied in [23]. PD patients

exhibit tremor, involuntary movements of the limbs. Typically the frequency spectrum of

tremor has broad peaks at ”harmonic” frequencies, much like that is seen in other physical

processes.

In general, this type of harmonic structure in the frequency domain may be

due to two possible mechanisms: a nonlinear oscillation or a superposition of (multiple)

independent modes of oscillation [23]. Various dynamical states of PD patients are also

studied by means of the time series of pathological tremor in ﬁngers [31, 32, 33, 34, 35].

At present special attention is attached to the problems of distinguishing and analyzing

of the stochastic and regular components of experimental time series of biological systems.

Thereto various methods of nonlinear physics and simulation by nonlinear oscillators [36,

37, 38, 39, 40], the methods of fractal analysis of time series [41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], the

methods of detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [47, 48] et al. are used.

In Ref.

[36] Babloyantz et al. presented a simple graphical method that unveils subtle

correlations between short sequences of a chaotic time series. Similar events, even from

noisy and nonstationary data, are clustered together and appear as well-deﬁned patterns

on a two-dimensional diagram and can be quantiﬁed. The general method is applied to

the electrocardiogram of a patient with a malfunctioning pacemaker, the residence times of

trajectories in the Lorenz attractor as well as the logistic map. In this paper the authors

introduced a simple graphical method that projects the trajectories of chaotic attractors into

various planes in a way mat unveils very subtle correlations between consecutive sequences

of events. The merit of the method resides in the fact that these sequences may extend over

more than ten events. The sequences with similar relationships but not the same absolute

values may appear as well-deﬁned structures in a two-dimensional diagram. The advantage

of this mapping is that, although the sequences may take into account more than three

consecutive events, the two-dimensional projections are extremely helpful visual aides for

elucidation of some aspects of chaotic dynamics.

5

Goldbeter et al. study various biological rhythms which regulate the vital activity of living

systems and determine the control mechanisms of these rhythms. In Ref. [38] the periodic

oscillations at all levels of biological organization, with periods ranging from a fraction

of a second to years were observed. The authors of Ref. [39] examined the mechanisms of

transitions from simple to complex oscillatory phenomena in metabolic and genetic networks.

The mechanisms underlying such transitions are examined in models for a variety of rhythmic

processes in several live systems. Ref. [40] is devoted to the study of circadian oscillations

stochastic dynamics and the inﬂuences the gene expression exerts on it. Authors show the

way robust circadian oscillations are produced from a ”bar-code” pattern of gene expression.

Liebovitch et al. reveal the local features of dynamics of various biological systems by

the methods of fractal analysis and various methods of nonlinear physics.

In Ref.

[41]

the question was examined: the way the dynamics of neural networks of the Hopﬁeld type

depends on the updating scheme, temperature dependence, degree of locality of connections

between elements and the number of memories. Further the results were applied to interpret

some features of protein dynamics. In Refs. [42, 43] authors studied the self-organizing and

the synchronization of the trajectory of a coupled systems dynamics. In particular, in Ref.

[42] the authors introduced a scheme of controlling the dynamics of deterministic systems by

coupling it to the dynamics of other similar systems. The controlled systems synchronized

their dynamics with the control signal in periodic as well as chaotic regimes. In Ref. [44] the

processes of transition from persistent to antipersistent correlation was studied by means

of fractal analysis methods of a time series:

fractional Brownian motion, rescaled range

analysis, variance analysis, zero-crossing analysis. The authors discussed several simple

random walk models which produce such transitions (bounded correlated random walk,

fractional Brownian motion with a long relaxation time), and therefore are candidates for

the mechanisms that may be present in some biological systems. The authors have studied

the way the pattern, seen in the experimental data of biological systems, persistent at short

time intervals and antipersistent at long time intervals, could arise from dynamical systems.

The comparison of Hurst coeﬃcient, which was calculated on the basis of diﬀerent fractal

analysis methods, was carried out. The article [45] is devoted to the study of the cardiac

rhythm abnormalities by means of estimation of the probability density function and Hurst

rescaled range analysis. In paper [46] the authors examined the eﬀects of fractal ion-channel

activity in modiﬁcations of two classical neuronal models: Fitzhugh-Nagumo and Hodgkin-

Huxley. The authors came to the conclusion that fractal ion channel gating activity was

6

suﬃcient to account for the fractal-rate ﬁring behavior.

In this paper a qualitatively new methodology of extracting the information from the

time series on the united basis of the theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes

and the ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy for the case of Parkinson’s disease is submitted. This

methodology presents a simple graphic and relatively inexpensive method of analysis of

various physiological and pathological patient’s states. In particular, it allows to make a

quantitative estimation of the quality of treatment and to deﬁne the most eﬀective method

of treatment in each individual case and for a group of patients. We determine the structure

of the initial time signal, and also the information about the non-stationary eﬀects or about

the dynamic alternation by a set of quantitative physical characteristics. We give special

attention to the analysis of correlations and ﬂuctuations which determine the time evolution

in live systems.

the following questions:

In particular, the signals of PD pathological tremor are physically interpreted to answer

(i) How can the study of the stochastic behavior and regularity in tremor signals help in

evaluating the state of a PD patient?

(ii) How do certain physical parameters related to Markov and non-Markov features,

statistical memory eﬀects and dynamic alternation of relaxation modes in the initial time

signal change?

(iii) How do the low- and high-frequency components of the initial time signal respond

to the changes of pathological tremor in the patient under treatment?

II. BASIC CONCEPTS AND DEFINITION OF STATISTICAL THEORY OF DIS-

CRETE NON-MARKOV RANDOM PROCESSES

The theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes [1, 2] is based on the ﬁnite-

diﬀerence representation of the kinetic Zwanzig-Mori’s equations [49, 50, 51, 52] for con-

densed matters, which are well known in the statistical physics of nonequilibrium processes.

The theory is also widely used in analyzing complex biological and social systems. Dynamic,

kinetic and relaxation parameters provided by this theory contain detailed information on

a wide range of parameters and properties of complex systems.

Let the behavior of PD pathological tremor velocity be described by a discrete time series

7

xj of variable X:

X = {x(T ), x(T + τ ), x(T + 2τ ), ..., x(T + τ N − τ )}.

(1)

Here T is the time at which the recording of the pathological tremor is started, (N − 1)τ is

the total time of signal recording, and τ is the discretization time. In the system under study

the discretization time is τ = 10−2 sec. To describe the dynamic parameters of pathological

tremor (correlation dynamics), it is convenient to use a normalized time correlation function

(TCF):

a(t) =

(2)

TCF depending on current t = mτ can be conveniently used to analyze dynamic properties of

complex systems. TCF usage means that the developed method is true of complex systems,

when correlation function exists. The mean value hXi, ﬂuctuations δxj, absolute (σ2) and
relative (δ2) dispersion for a set of random variables (Eq. 1) can be easily found by:

hXi =

The function a(t) satisﬁes the normalization and relaxation conditions of correlations:

limt→0 a(t) = 1, limt→∞ a(t) = 0.

By using the Zwanzig-Mori’s technique of projection operators [49, 50, 51, 52] it is possible

to receive an interconnected chain of ﬁnite-diﬀerence equations of a non-Markovian type [1, 2]

for the initial TCF a(t) and the normalized memory functions in the following way:

△a(t)
△t

Here λ1 is the eigenvalue and Λ1 is the relaxation parameter of Liouville’s quasioperator ˆL.

Function M1(jτ ) is a normalized memory function of the ﬁrst order:

Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure hWn, Wmi = δn,mh|Wn|2i, where δn,m is Kro-

necker’s symbol, can be used to rewrite the above equations in a compact form:

W0 = A0

k(0), W1 = (i ˆL − λ1)W0, W2 = (i ˆL − λ2)W1 − Λ1W0, ...,

Wn = (i ˆL − λn)Wn−1 − Λn−1Wn−2 − ... .

Then the eigenvalue λ1 of Liouville’s quasioperator and the relaxation parameter Λ1 in Eq.

(3) take the form of:

hW0 ˆLW0i
h|W0|2i
The normalized memory function of the ﬁrst order in Eq. (3) is rewritten as:

hW0 ˆLW1i
h|W0|2i

, Λ1 = i

λ1 = i

.

M1(t) =

hW1(1 + iτ ˆL22)mW1i
h|W1(0)|2i

.

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence kinetic equation (3) represents the generalization of Zwanzig-Mori’s

kinetic theory [49, 50, 51, 52], which is well known in statistical physics, for complex dis-

crete non-Hamiltonian statistical systems. Within our method of the analysis of dynamics

of the statistical time series we do not use the equation (3) as an object for the subsequent

theoretical analysis. In this connection we do not use the equations such as Zwanzig-Mori’s

for memory functions of the 2-nd and higher orders. We use the algorithm, which was above

described, to calculate the time dynamics a(t), M1(t) and parameters λ1, Λ1. The depen-

dences a(t) and M1(t) are calculated on the basis of the experimental data, independently

of each other. At the same time we control the conformity of the calculated dependences

a(t), M1(t) and parameters λ1, Λ1 to the equation (3) (the precision of the conformity is

∼ 2 − 5% for the cases described here). We use the dependences a(t) and M1(t) to analyze

the amplitude of Parkinsonian tremor velocity. We also use these dependences to calculate

the non-Markovity parameter [1, 2] which characterizes the degree of correlativity of the

9

signal. The studies, which have been carried out earlier [2, 12, 13], show that this parameter

contains detailed information about the physiological state of a system.

In this paper we shall use the spectral dependence ε1(ν) of the ﬁrst point of the non-

Markovity parameter [1, 2]:

ε1(ν) =

Further we shall show, that the application of the frequency-dependence ε1(ν) and the values

(cid:27)

allows to introduce the quantitative estimations for various dynamic states of a patient with

PD. In particular, we shall show, that the values of parameter ε1(0) ∼ 101 for the analyzed

system are characteristic of stable physiological states (for the patient under treatment).

The appearance of pathology in a system leads to a sharp decrease in this parameter, ap-

proximately by one order. Thus, we can compare quantitatively various dynamic states of

the studied system considering the changes of the non-Markovity parameter.

III. FLICKER-NOISE SPECTROSCOPY FOR ANALYSIS OF TIME SERIES OF

DYNAMIC VARIABLES

New information about chaotic time signals can be obtained by the method of the ﬂicker-

noise spectroscopy (FNS) [53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Its advantage consists in extracting informa-

tion from the series of distinct irregularities (spikes, jumps, discontinuities of derivatives of

various orders) by analyzing the behavior of time, spatial and power dynamic variables at

each existential level of the hierarchical organization of the system. Thus, the most valuable

information is obtained by analyzing the power spectra and the diﬀerence moments (”struc-

tural functions”) of various orders. It is necessary to point out, that the diﬀerence moments

are formed exclusively by irregularities of a jump type. On the other hand the power spectra

are formed by the contributions of two types of irregularities: peaks and jumps.

10

The FNS method was applied to analyze the dynamics of various physical and chemical

processes [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]. Among them are ﬂuctuations of electric voltage in

electrochemical systems (considered in the process of formation of porous silicon under con-

ditions of anodic polarization, formation of molecular hydrogen on platinum under cathodic

polarization, initiation of hydrodynamical instability in the ﬁeld of an over-limiting current

in electro-membrane systems), ﬂuctuating dynamics of the solar activity, ﬂuctuation of a

velocity component in turbulent streams. Unique abilities of the FNS method to locate the

multipoint correlation interrelations were shown in works [66, 67, 68]. That was done on the

basis of the analysis of simultaneously measured signals at spaced points of the distributed

systems.

The basic relations of FNS are given below. We analyze the chaotic series of dynamic

variable x(t) over the time interval Ttot = Nτ , where τ is a sampling time.

1. We proceed from the notion of hierarchy of spatial-temporal levels of the organization

of open dynamic dissipative systems.

2. The most valuable information in the chaotic series is stored in irregularities of various

types, such as peaks, jumps, breaks of derivatives of diﬀerent orders. The parameters which

characterize the properties of irregularities, can be obtained by the analysis of power spectra

where tn is a delay parameter. Further, when considering the dependence Φ(2)(tn) we will

not specify the bottom index.

It should be noted that the proposed averaging procedure diﬀers from Gibbs’s procedure

when averaging is carried out by using the probability density. Actually, we do not consider

11

the statistics of ensembles as it is done in the statistical Gibbs’s thermodynamics which

is based on ergodic hypothesis. We also generalize Einstein’s approach to the analysis of

ﬂuctuation dynamics [69, 70].

3. Parameters or ”passport data”, obtained by the analysis of dependences S(f ) and

Φ(2)(tn), are correlation times and dimensionless parameters. These dimensionless parame-

ters describe the loss of ”memory” (correlation relations) in irregularities of a ”spikes” and

4. For stationary processes in open dissipative systems the moment Φ(2)(tn) depends

only on the diﬀerence of arguments nτ . The self-similar structure is realized in this case.

It means that the dependences S(f ) or Φ(2)(tn) are identical for each level of the system

It should be noted, that the reverse transformations in the FNS methodology are not

used in the way it takes place in Fourier- or in wavelet-analysis. Therefore, no constraints

are imposed on the character of the dependence x(t) except for the existence of average

”jumps” type.

values.

A. Basic equations for stationary processes

Let’s obtain approximations for S(f ) and Φ(2)(tn), which are determined by irregularities

in the behavior of dynamic variables. At the ﬁrst stage the generalized δ-functions are

used to approximate the spikes of the dynamic variables, and Heavyside functions are used

to approximate the jumps. At the same time the ”low-frequency” limit f ≪ 1/2πTi is

considered, when the characteristic time intervals Ti between the nearest irregularities are

much less than all the characteristic times of the considered system. In case of stationary

processes the obtained expressions are the same for each of the hierarchical levels. Then

simple approximation dependence (see [53, 54, 55, 56, 57] for more information) can be

obtained for S(f ) and Φ(2)(tn).

The approximation for the structural function of the second order reads:

Φ(2)(t) = 2 · σ2 ·

1 − Γ−1(H1) · Γ(H1, t/T1)

(9)

2 .

(cid:3)

Here Γ(s) and Γ(s, x) are respectively the gamma-function and incomplete gamma-function

(x ≥ 0 and s > 0); σ is dispersion of the measured dynamic variable with dimension [x].

Value H1 is a Hurst’s parameter. It characterizes the rate of loss of ”memory” during the

(cid:2)

12

time intervals shorter than the correlation time T1. As follows from Eq.(9), Φ(2)(t) → σ2 for

t ≫ T1, parameter T1 actually characterizes the time interval during which ”forgetting” of

the previous value of the dynamic variable occurs. Such ”forgetting” is the consequence of

the ”jumps” of the dynamic variable at each level of the spatio-temporal hierarchy. True,

the structural function is zero, Φ(2)(t) = 0, for the sequences of the irregularities-spikes,

which are represented by a sequence of δ-functions (see chapter 4.3 (Fig. 51) of Schuster’s

monograph [70]). At the same time, a continuous power spectrum S(f ) can be calculated for

the correlated sequence of δ-functions within a low-frequency limit at f ≪ 1/2πTi, as was

shown in Ref. [70]. S(f ) is determined by a correlation character of the analyzed sequence

of the generalized functions. In particular, S(f ) can have dependence of a ﬂicker-noise type:

S(f ) ∼ 1/f s, where s ∼ 1. The conclusion about diverse information carried by the power

spectra and the diﬀerence moments underlies the FNS method. Some artiﬁcial time series,

generalizing the image of the signal as the sequence of δ-functions, earlier introduced by

Schuster is used in this case.

Any signal, formed exclusively by irregularities-jumps, can be subject to Fourier trans-

formation to obtain the power spectrum. Thus, the diﬀerence moment Φ(2)(t) is formed only

by jumps of a dynamic variable at diﬀerent spatio-temporal levels of the system hierarchy,

and both spikes and jumps contribute to the power spectrum S(f ).

The standard notion about the identity of the information represented by Φ(2)(t) and

S(f ), is valid only for ”smooth” functions. However, real signals V (t) are never smooth.

Therefore, the FNS method focuses on giving the essence of information on sequences of

irregularities latent in real signals and eliminates information discrepancy, making it possible

to extract the information by considering various features.

Eq. (9) can be used to ﬁnd the phenomenological parameters [H1, T1, σ]. Contribution

SJ (f ) to the power spectrum S(f ), determined by the inﬂuence of irregularities, such as

jumps, is expressed by the formula:

SJ (f ) ≈ SJ (0)

Due to spikes the contribution SB(f ) to power spectrum S(f ) can be generally presented as

(10)

(11)

SB(f ) ≈

SB(0)
1 + (2πf T00)n0

,

13

where parameter n0 characterizes the velocity of the ”losses of memory” (correlation rela-

tions) in a sequence of spikes during the time intervals shorter than the correlation time

T00. Parameters [n0, T00, SB(0)] characterize self-similarity in the correlation relations of the

peaks. For the resulting power spectrum an approximation is used:

S(f ) ≈

S(0)
1 + (2πf T0)n ,

(12)

where S(0), T0 and n are phenomenological parameters. The parameters which are de-

termined in such a way diﬀer from the parameters which are used in Eq.(10): SJ (0) 6=

SB(0), T1 6= T0 and 2H1 + 1 6= n0. So, the parameters determined from the power spectra

and the structural functions of the second order give diﬀerent information. The comparison

of the parameters obtained by the analysis of the experimental series with numerical values

of the parameters for model cases (Fick diﬀusion, Levy diﬀusion, Kolmogorov turbulence,

turbulent diﬀusion, see [57]) allows to estimate qualitatively the character of the studied

evolution (see [57] for more information).

The use of irregularities such as spikes, jumps, discontinuities of derivatives as the infor-

mation basis of the FNS method allows to classify and extract phenomenological information

contained in chaotic series. However, evolution of real biological systems has a more com-

plex and non-stationary nature. In particular, the resonance frequencies in the dependences

described above, can be speciﬁc for the studied system. The resonance frequencies appear

as peaks in the power spectra S(f ) and the oscillatory character of function Φ(2)(t). Thus,

the values of resonance frequencies can change during the non-stationary evolution. There-

fore for each state of the studied dynamics, the dependences S(f ) and Φ(2)(t) are to be

considered as ”patterns” or ”cliche”. These dependences allow to estimate individual infor-

mational characteristics of the state of the system: times of loss of correlation relations, sets

of speciﬁc frequencies, factors of non-stationarity. This will be demonstrated below in the

analysis of Parkinsonian tremor dynamics.

B. Relaxation smoothing of signal, splitting into ”low frequency” and ”high fre-

quency” components

In the analysis of the experimental series we frequently face the problem of smoothing of

the initial signals. Usually the smoothing polynoms and wavelets are used to ﬁltrate a signal

and to extract a low-frequency component. Here we will describe brieﬂy the method [57]

14

(13)

(14)

(15a)

(15b)

of splitting the signal into ”low-frequency” xR(t) and ”high-frequency” xF (t) components.

The method is based on an iterative procedure of a numeric solution of a heat conductivity

equation:

It uses an elementary explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme:

that gives:

last equation as:

calculated as:

(cid:0)
Using designation D = χ∆τ /(∆t)2, where D is a diﬀusion coeﬃcient, we shall rewrite the

(cid:1)

Iterations of this formula give a stable solution to D < 1/2 [57]. For the smoothing

procedure it is necessary to set limiting conditions. Let smoothing be carried out for a series

of M samples (points). At each step of iterations extreme values for k = 1 and k = M are

When calculating new values of signal xj+1

j = 0 the initial signal x(t) is set) we can obtain ”low-frequency” component xR. ”High-

frequency” component xF is obtained by subtracting it from the initial signal. Actually, the

smoothing procedure corresponds to the consecutive reduction of local gradients of values of

variables with mutual rapprochement of points. The splitting of the initial signal x(t) into

two components xR(t) and xF (t) enables us to calculate the dependences S(f ) and Φ(2)(t)

for three functions xJ (t) (J = R, F or G = R + F ). Index G is used for the initial signal

x(t). In particular, the low-frequency (”ﬂicker-noise”) component, which is present in any

chaotic signal, is eﬀectively removed when calculating dependence SF (f ). Therefore, speciﬁc

frequencies of the studied system come to light. This will be shown below in the analysis

of the ﬂuctuations of Parkinsonian tremor velocity. The analysis of dependences S(f ) and

Φ(2)(t), which are calculated separately for each of components R and F , presents special

interest for the study of medical parameters.

IV. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA. VELOCITY OF PATHOLOGICAL

TREMOR IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE

As the experimental data we use the time records of pathological tremor velocity in an

index ﬁnger of patients with Parkinson’s disease [71, 72].

Sixteen subjects with Parkinson’s disease participated in the study. All subjects were

receiving chronic stimulation either uni- or bilaterally to relieve the symptoms of Parkin-

son’s disease including tremor, dyskinesia or rigidity. The participants received DBS (deep

brain stimulation) of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) or subthalamic nucleus (STN), or

ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim). They were all under 70 years of age and

the group included 11 males and 5 females. All participants were clinically stable at the

moment of the tests; they did not show cognitive impairment and did not suﬀer from a major

depressive disorder. All subjects were under minimum dopaminergic therapy (ranging from

300 to 1200 mg per day of L-Dopa) at the time of the study and took other Parkinson’s

disease related medications.

The selected subjects were asked to refrain from taking their medication for at least 12

h before the beginning of the tests and were allowed to have not more than one coﬀee for

breakfast on the two testing days. Rest tremor was recorded on the most aﬀected side

with a velocity-transducing laser [73, 74]. This laser is a safe (Class II) helium-neon laser.

The laser beam is split, with one part directed at the ﬁnger and the other, called the

reference, directed at a rotating disk inside the laser. Back scattered light from the rotating

disk is used to determine the sign of the velocity signal. Finger tremor was detected and

converted into a calibrated voltage output proportional to ﬁnger velocity. Velocity is more

sensitive to low frequency components inherent in pathological and physiological tremor

[74]. Than acceleration is the system did not require any special calibration procedure. The

laser was placed at about 30 cm from the index ﬁnger tip and the laser beam was directed

perpendicular to a piece of a reﬂective tape placed on the ﬁnger tip.

Tremor was recorded with a velocity laser under two conditions of DBS (on-oﬀ), under

two conditions of medication (L-Dopa on-oﬀ) and under four conditions of 15, 30, 45, 60

minute periods after stopping DBS. The conditions, counterbalanced among the subjects

included the following.

1. The ”OFF-OFF” condition (no medication and no stimulation).

2. The ”ON-ON” condition (on medication and on stimulation).

16

3. The DBS condition - the ”ON-OFF” condition (stimulation only).

4. The L-Dopa condition - the ”OFF-ON” condition (no stimulation).

5-8. The ”15 OFF”, ”30 OFF”, ”45 OFF”, ”60 OFF” conditions - the patient’s states

15, 30, 45, 60, minutes after the DBS is switched oﬀ, no medication.

V. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS. COMPARISON OF STATISTICAL THEORY

OF DISCRETE NON-MARKOV RANDOM PROCESSES AND FLICKER-NOISE

SPECTROSCOPY

In this section we present the results of the analysis of the experimental data [71, 72, 73],

which are obtained on the basis of the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic

processes and the ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy. As an demonstrative example, we describe

the results for one of the patients (the sixth patient, a woman, 61 years old, deep brain

stimulated bilaterally target structures: subthalamic nucleus, total daily medication 300

mg). The analysis the of experimental data allows to reveal some dynamic properties of

Parkinson’s disease tremor in each individual case and a group of patients. The obtained

results characterize the group of sixteen patients in a general way.

A. Non-Markovity, randomness, dynamic alternation and pathological tremor

caused by Parkinson’s disease

In Fig. 1 the initial time series of Parkinsonian tremor velocity of the patient’s (sixth

patient) index ﬁnger tremor is shown. By this record it is possible to reveal great diﬀerences

(see the vertical scale) in tremor velocity of the patient’s state, when the treatment is not

used (Fig. 1a) and under medical treatment (Figs. 1b-d). The amplitudes of the tremor

velocity for the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state (Fig. 1a) and for the ”ON-ON” state (Fig. 1b)

diﬀer by 94 times on average. The amplitude of tremor velocity when the DBS is switched

oﬀ (”15 OFF”, ”30 OFF”, ”45 OFF”, ”60 OFF” conditions) (Figs. 1e-h) has a residual

periodic character. The analysis of the initial time records does not allow to determine a

method with the best medical eﬀect. In some cases (Figs. 1e, h) a medical method produces

a negative eﬀect that results in the amplitude increase of tremor velocity and deterioration

of the state of the patient. It is diﬃcult to draw a conclusion about the eﬃcacy of this or

that treatment and to explain the after-eﬀect of the DBS based on the initial time signals.

Figure 1: Pathological tremor velocity in the left index ﬁnger of the sixth patient with Parkinson’s

disease. The registration of Parkinsonian tremor velocity is carried out in the following conditions:

(a) ”OFF-OFF” condition (no treatment), (b) ”ON-ON” condition (using DBS and medicaments),

(c) ”ON-OFF” condition (DBS only), (d) ”OFF-ON” condition (medicaments (L-Dopa) only), (e)

- (h) the ”15 OFF”, ”30 OFF”, ”45 OFF”, ”60 OFF” conditions - the patient’s states 15 (30, 45,

60) minutes after the DBS is switched oﬀ, no treatment. Let’s note the scale of the pathological

tremor amplitude (see the vertical scale). Such representation of the time series allows us to note

the increase or the decrease of pathological tremor.

A diﬀerent representation of the signal allows to reveal the eﬀects of periodicity and

randomness in the initial time series. In Fig. 2 the initial time series of tremor velocity in

two states of the patient (see Figs. 1a, d) are shown. We have chosen some local areas (500

points) of these time records. For the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state (Fig. 2c) the initial time

signal has a periodic structure. Similar periodicity of the initial time signal is connected

to pathological tremor of the patient’s limbs (with frequency ν = 5.2Hz). Retention of

the structure is also observed when the DBS is switched oﬀ (see Figs. 1e-h). Medication

produces a diﬀerent eﬀect on the patient (”OFF-ON” state, see Fig. 2d). The periodicity

of the initial signal is replaced by randomness. The similar picture is characteristic of all

methods of treatment (see Figs. 1b-d). This conclusion conﬁrms the general idea about the

transition of stochastic dynamic modes in case of the patient’s normal physiological state to

the periodic modes in a pathological state. This reasoning was conﬁrmed by the analysis of

the initial time series of all sixteen patients.

The plane projections of phase trajectories of the two ﬁrst dynamic orthogonal variables

W0, W1 (see Sec. II) in various states of the patient are shown in Fig. 3. All ﬁgures are

submitted according to the initial time series. The structure of the phase trajectories is

determined by the presence of ﬂuctuations in the initial time series. The most signiﬁcant

ﬂuctuations lead to deformation of phase clouds. The phase portraits consist of empty cores

and helicoidal trajectories with a high concentration of phase points in the ”OFF-OFF”

patient’s state (Fig. 3a) and in the cases when the DBS is switched oﬀ (”15 OFF”, ”30

OFF”, ”45 OFF”, ”60 OFF”, see Figs. 3e-h). The presence of empty cores is explained

by the insigniﬁcant quantity of small ﬂuctuations near a zero value. Such structure of the

phase portrait is determined by periodicity in the initial time signal (Fig. 2c). Here one can

note a completely diﬀerent picture of the eﬀect any medical treatment has on the patient’s

Figure 3: The phase portraits of the two ﬁrst orthogonal dynamic variables W0, W1 for pathological

tremor in the patient with Parkinson’s disease. The phase portraits are submitted according to the

initial time series. The form of the phase portraits reﬂects the initial time signal dynamics. The

periodic structure of the initial signal is determined by helicoidal phase trajectories (a, e-h); the

randomness of the initial signal is reﬂected in the curvature of the phase trajectories (b-d). The

most signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations of the time signal cause deformation of the phase portraits under any

medical inﬂuence. The similar forms of phase clouds are characteristic of all the groups of patients.

organism. One can see rare signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations instead of small ﬂuctuations of tremor

velocity. These peak deviations result in acute-angled deformations of the central cores

with a high concentration of phase points. The form of phase portraits corresponds to the

dynamic alternation of periodic and stochastic components of the initial time signal. It is

possible to draw a conclusion about the most eﬀective method of treatment of each patient

judging by the form of phase clouds. For the sixth patient two methods of treatment are

almost equivalent: the complex treatment of a patient by two medical methods (Fig. 3b)

and by using medicaments only (Fig. 3d).

The initial TCF power spectrum µ0(ν) (see Sec.

II) in various physiological states of

the patient is shown in Fig. 4. All dependences are presented on a log-log scale. At char-

acteristic frequency ν = 5.2Hz the peak is observed for each power spectrum. The peak

amplitude is determined by the amplitude of tremor velocity in the initial time signal. In

Figure 4: The initial time correlation function µ0(ν) power spectrum for pathological tremor in the

patient with Parkinson’s disease. The power spectra are submitted according to the arrangement

of the initial time series. The log-log scale is chosen to receive a more detailed information. In

the initial TCF µ0(ν) power spectrum the power peak is observed on frequency ν = 5.2Hz. The

amplitude of this peak is determined by the amplitude of the initial time signal. The oscillations

(a, e-h) are clearly expressed in the low frequencies area of the power spectrum. The low-frequency

oscillations vanish, and the amplitude of the power peak on frequency ν = 5.2Hz decreases with

the application of any method of treatment (b-d). The amplitude of this peak changes a little bit

when the DBS is used. It reﬂects low eﬃciency of this method of treatment (of the sixth patient).

The form of power spectrum µ0(ν) is determined by the nature of the initial time signals.

case of any medical treatment the peak amplitude considerably decreases. It happens be-

cause the amplitude of pathological tremor decreases. Any power spectrum reﬂects dynamic

alternation eﬀects in the initial time series. Oscillations are seen in the power spectra (Figs.

4a, e-h). Their periodic nature is clearly expressed by a low frequency range. The periodic

structure of the power spectra is broken, oscillations disappear, the amplitude of the peak

on frequency ν = 5.2Hz decreases under treatment. Such form of the power spectra is

connected to the ampliﬁcation of randomness eﬀects in the initial time series. The periodic

nature of the patient’s Parkinsonian tremor velocity is replaced by stochastic ﬂuctuations

with a low amplitude of tremor velocity. On the whole, the comparative analysis of the

21

power spectra shows that medicamentous treatment has the most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the

patient’s organism (thus the combined use of medicaments and DBS is almost equivalent).

The use of DBS stimulation does not decrease abnormal oscillations signiﬁcantly.

The eﬀects of randomness and regularity are most visible in the frequency dependences

of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markov parameter ε1(ν). The physical idea of this parameter

consists in revelation of Markov and non-Markov features in the time series. This param-

eter classiﬁes all stochastic processes into random Markov processes ε ≫ 1, quasi-Markov

(intermediate) processes ε > 1 and non-Markov processes ε ∼ 1. Thus, the ﬁrst point of the

non-Markovity parameter at zero frequency ε1(0) contains the most signiﬁcant information.

This point accumulates the information about all dynamic peculiarities of the time series.

The increase of this value testiﬁes to the ampliﬁcation of Markov random eﬀects in the time

signals and the appearance of the eﬀects of short-range or instant memory. Thus, the com-

parative analysis of various physiological states of the patient shows that the higher value

of ε1(0) ∼ 101 corresponds to the smaller pathological tremor velocity. For the smallest

pathological tremor velocities (in one of the patients of the studied group) the values of this

parameter are maximal and achieve the value of ε1(0) ∼ 102. On the contrary, the decrease

of this parameter reﬂects the ampliﬁcation of non-Markov eﬀects in the initial time series.

Thus, the decrease of parameter ε1(0) corresponds to the increase in Parkinsonian tremor

velocity in the initial time signal. The greatest pathological tremor velocities (for one of the

patients of the studied group) are characterized by minimal values ε1(0) ∼ 100. Thus, the

value of ε1(0) reﬂects the behavior of the patient’s tremor amplitude.

It should be noted that we use the value of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter

at zero frequency ε1(0) as the quantitative measure which reﬂects Markov and non-Markov

eﬀects in the initial time series. The values of the non-Markovity parameter at zero frequency

determine long-range correlations (in a limiting case for t → ∞). The greater values of

parameter ε1(0) determine stronger correlations. This thesis conﬁrms a general concept

that long-range correlations should take place in a stable healthy live subject. We remind

that in this work we analyze the time series of pathological tremor of a patient and we

observe only minimal alterations of parameter ε1(0) (from a unit up to several tens.)

The periodic structure of pathological tremor velocity is reﬂected also in frequency de-

pendences of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter (Figs. 5a, e-h). Oscillations

emerge with a characteristic frequency ν ∼ 5.2Hz. The oscillations are most appreciable in

the low frequency range. This structure is completely suppressed by medical inﬂuence on

Figure 5: The frequency dependence of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ν) for

pathological tremor velocity in the patient. For example, the sixth patient with Parkinson’s disease

is chosen. The ﬁgures are submitted according to the arrangement of the initial time series. The

characteristic low-frequency oscillations are observed in frequency dependences (a, e-h), which get

suppressed under medical inﬂuence (b-d). The non-Markovity parameter reﬂects the Markov and

non-Markov components of the initial time signal. The value of the parameter on zero frequency

ε1(0) reﬂects the total dynamics of the initial time signal. The maximal values of parameter

ε1(0) correspond to small amplitudes of pathological tremor velocity. The minimal values of this

parameter are characteristic of signiﬁcant pathological tremor velocities. The comparative analysis

of frequency dependences ε1(ν) allows us to estimate the eﬃciency of each method of treatment.

the patient’s organism. The fast change of various dynamic modes and the ampliﬁcation of

randomness eﬀects result in the infringement of the periodic picture. It is connected with

the decrease of pathological tremor, the ”ON-ON”, ”OFF-ON” states (Figs. 5b, d).

The analysis of the values of parameter ε1(0) in diﬀerent states of the patient speciﬁes

the most eﬀective method of treatment (pathological tremor suppression). Values ε1(0)M =

14.87 in the ”OFF-ON” patient’s state (using medicaments) and ε1(0)ON = 13.53 in the

”ON-ON” patient’s state (using medicaments and the DBS) show, that these methods of

treatment have almost the same positive eﬀects. For comparison: we have ε1(0)DBS = 3.56

in the ”ON-OFF” state of the studied patient (using the DBS), and ε1(0)OF F = 1.47 in the

Figure 6: The window-time behavior of the power spectrum µ0(ν) (a) and the frequency depen-

dence of parameter ε1(ν) (b) for pathological tremor in the ”OFF-OFF” condition (c). The local

representation of the TCF power spectrum and the frequency dependence of the -non-Markovity

parameter allows us to reﬂect the dynamic features of some areas of the time series. The localiza-

tion procedure consists in choosing the optimum length of the local sample, in dividing the time

series and in designing local characteristics for each sample. The increase of pathological tremor

velocity results in the increase of the amplitude of the power peaks at a characteristic frequency

and in the decrease of the non-Markovity parameter to a unit.

”OFF-OFF” state of the patient (no treatment).

The window-time behavior of the initial TCF power spectrum µ0(ν) (Fig. 6a) and the

ﬁrst point of the non-Markov parameter ε1(ν) (Fig. 6b) is shown in Fig. 6. For example,

we selected the initial time series in the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state. The design of this

dependence was realized by means of the localization procedure. The peculiarity of this

procedure consist in reﬂecting the dynamical properties of the local area of the initial time

signal [13]. First, the optimal length of the sample (window) must be determined. The

preliminary analysis of various window lengths gave the optimal length of 256 = 28 points.

The correlation function power spectrum µ0(ν) and the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ν) are

calculated for each of the windows. This procedure shows the dynamic features of local

areas of the initial time signal.

24

In Fig. 6a power peaks are observed at frequency ν = 5.2Hz in the window-time behavior

of the initial TCF power spectrum. The amplitude of these peaks reﬂects the increase or

decrease in Parkinsonian tremor. In particular, the most signiﬁcant peaks are visible for

windows 1-3. Thus, the highest pathological tremor of the initial time record corresponds

to these areas. The similar behavior of the power spectrum conﬁrms the periodic nature

of the initial time signal. The behavior of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ν) in Fig. 6b

is as follows. The value of parameter ε1(0) reaches a unit (see, windows 1-3, 8, 11, 13)

at the moments of the increase in pathological tremor velocity. Thus, the value of the

non-Markovity parameter starts to decrease 2.5-3 sec before the increase in tremor velocity.

When pathological tremor velocity decreases, the value of parameter ε1(0) increases to values

2-3 (in the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state, no treatment).

process [14]. The ratio of the mean-squared amplitude in the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state (no

treatment) and in the ”ON-ON” patient’s state (using medicaments and the DBS) makes

250 (!) times. It shows, that after the application of any type of treatment, relaxation rate

increases. Sharp distinctions of relaxation rate reﬂect pathological and normal physiologi-

cal processes. Thus, this quantitative characteristic allows to reveal eﬀective or ineﬃcient

methods of treatment (to decrease tremor velocity).

(Figs. 7e-h) components of the initial time signal (the tremor of the index ﬁnger velocity

in the four patient’s states, see Figs. 1a-d) are shown. Frequency dependence of the power

spectrum of high-frequency component SF (f ) is on a linear scale, and the power spectrum

of low-frequency component of time signal SR(f ) is on a log-log scale. The small set of

eigenfrequencies is characteristic of tremor of the ”OFF-OFF” patient’s state (Figs. 7a, e).

These frequencies are clearly visible at f01 ∼ 5.2Hz and f02 ∼ 10.1Hz. According to Figs.

7c, g, the situation does not change qualitatively, when the DBS (”ON-OFF” patient’s state)

is used, as the small set of eigenfrequencies of tremor is preserved. However, the maximal

sonian tremor velocity in the patient’s states 15 (a, e), 30 (b, f), 45 (c, g), 60 (d, h) minutes after

the DBS is switched oﬀ. The high-frequency component F is submitted on a linear scale, the

values of SF (f ) decrease by three orders and maximal values of SR(f ) decrease by two orders.

The situation changes qualitatively when medicaments are used (”OFF-ON”, Figs. 7d, h),

and also in case of the combined use of the DBS and medicaments (”ON-ON”, Figs. 7b, f).

Tremor velocity in these cases becomes more chaotic, since a wide band of eigenfrequencies

appears in the tremor power spectrum. The maximal values of frequencies in dependence

SF (f ) decrease by four orders, the values of SR(f ) decrease in the low frequencies range by

two orders under the combined use of the DBS and medicaments (”ON-ON”). Values SR(f )

in the low-frequencies area (when using medicaments, ”OFF-ON”) are commensurable with

values SR(f ) in the ”OFF-OFF” state.

The speciﬁc features characterizing tremor velocity in the patient with Parkinson’s disease

are seen in spectra SF (f ) and SR(f ) in Figs. 7a-h. It should be noted that the splitting of the

initial time signal x(t) into components xR(t) and xF (t) depends on quantity N of iterations

of ”diﬀusion” smoothing and the value of ”diﬀusion coeﬃcient” D (N = 10 and D = 1/4

Figure 10: The diﬀerence moments of the second order for high-frequency component F and low-

frequency component R of Parkinsonian tremor in the patient: (a, e) 15 minutes after the DBS is

switched oﬀ, (b, f) 30 minutes after the DBS is switched oﬀ, (c, g) 45 minutes after the DBS is

switched oﬀ, (d, h) - 60 minutes after the DBS is switched oﬀ. Medicaments are not used. The

ﬁgures are submitted on a log-log scale. The aftereﬀects of the DBS render insigniﬁcant inﬂuence

on the initial characteristics of tremor velocity.

The combined use of the DBS and medicaments (”ON-ON”, Figs. 9b, f) results in the

strongest changes in tremor velocity: the dispersion of ﬂuctuations decreases by two orders

and the contribution of ”resonance” frequencies is considerably suppressed. It is seen in Fig.

9. The latter conclusion follows from the decrease of the oscillatory component.

Time dependence in Fig. 10 characterizes the dynamics of pathological tremor velocity

in the patient’s states when the DBS is switched oﬀ (”15 OFF”, ”30 OFF”, ”45 OFF”, ”60

OFF”). The comparative analysis of Figs. 9 and 10 shows that the initial parameters of the

patient’s tremor (”OFF-OFF” state) almost do not vary. Thus, the dispersion of ﬂuctuations

somewhat decreases and the ”resonance” component of the initial signal actually does not

change.

VI. CONCLUSIONS. THE ANALYSIS OF PATHOLOGICAL TREMOR CAUSED

BY PARKINSON’S DISEASE

In this work we oﬀer a new method of analyzing one of the symptoms of Parkinson’s

disease. This method is based on the combined use of the statistical theory of discrete

non-Markov stochastic processes and the ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy. Each of the oﬀered

theories reﬂects the speciﬁc dynamic peculiarities of Parkinson’s disease tremor. Combined

representation of the obtained results allows to extract the most complete and trustworthy

information about the dynamics of Parkinsonian tremor.

As experimental data we used the time series of the tremor velocity of an index ﬁnger

of the patient with Parkinson’s disease for various methods of treatment. The tremor of a

human’s limbs certainly is just one of the external symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. However

the tremor dynamics of a human’s limb is caused by complex interrelation of separate areas

of brain, central nervous system, locomotor system, chemical and biological metabolism.

Any anomaly of one of these systems is clearly reﬂected in tremor dynamics. The analysis

of the stochastic dynamics of a human’s index ﬁnger tremor is only part of the complex

analysis of the patient’s states.

The analysis of stochastic dynamics of the pathological tremor velocity shows the change

of the physical nature of the signal. The robust periodic structure with speciﬁc oscillation

frequency is characteristic of the time series of pathological tremor velocity in ”OFF-OFF”

patient’s state (no treatment). The similar structure of the initial time signal is connected to

the pathological tremor of the limbs in the patient with Parkinson’s disease. The structure

of the signal changes and becomes more stochastic when the patient undergoes treatment.

The ampliﬁcation of stochastic eﬀects in the initial signal is connected to the increase of

degrees of freedom in the studied system. Their maximal value corresponds to a normal

physiological state.

The ﬁrst technique consists in determining the Markov and non-Markov components

of the initial time signal, manifestation of long-range and short-range statistical memory

eﬀects, the ampliﬁcation and degradation of correlations in the initial time signal. This

technique also allows to reveal the eﬀects of randomness, regularity and periodicity, dynamic

alternation eﬀects of various relaxation processes for overall initial time series and their local

areas. The statistical theory of discrete stochastic non-Markov processes makes it possible

to obtain the whole spectrum of quantitative and qualitative values and the characteristics

30

based on the information carried by ﬂuctuations and correlations in the initial time signals.

The stochastic dynamics of pathological tremor velocity in various dynamic states of a

patient with Parkinson’s disease is clearly reﬂected in the phase portraits of orthogonal vari-

ables, in power spectra of a correlation function and memory functions of the lower orders,

in frequency dependences of the non-Markov parameter, in local relaxation and kinetic pa-

rameters. The analysis of all the information about the correlations and ﬂuctuations of the

initial time series allows to estimate the eﬃciency of diﬀerent methods of treatment. For

example, we analyzed the experimental data of one of the patients with Parkinson’s disease.

We used the statistical spectrum of the non-Markovity parameter to reveal Markov and

non-Markov eﬀects in the initial time series. The increase or decrease of pathological tremor

velocity predetermines the changes of the statistical non-Markovity parameter. The increase

of the stochastic eﬀects and the Markov components of the initial time signal and the

manifestation of long-range correlations correspond to the decrease of pathological tremor

velocity. At the same time the increase of pathological tremor velocity is accompanied by

the occurrence of the eﬀects of periodicity and regularity, harmonic oscillations, non-Markov

eﬀects, the manifestation of memory eﬀects and degradation of correlations in the initial time

signals.

The described localization procedure reﬂects the dynamic properties of pathological

tremor in some local areas of the initial time series. The window-time behavior of the

initial time correlation function µ0(ν) and the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parame-

ter ε1(ν) reﬂects the predictors of changes in pathological tremor velocity. Any changes

of pathological tremor are instantly reﬂected in the window-time behavior of the dynamic

characteristics.

Dynamic characteristics hAi and σ2 of relaxation parameter λ1 reﬂect relaxation rate in

various dynamic patient’s states. The use of any method of treatment results in acceleration

of stabilization process. Signiﬁcant distinctions in the dynamic characteristics of parameter

λ1 in the state of the patient with no treatment (”OFF-OFF” condition) and in the complex

use of medicaments and the DBS (”ON-ON” condition) allow to estimate the relaxation

scales of physiological processes for healthy and sick people.

Finally, the change of the nature of the pathological tremor time signal results in the

change of the whole set of quantitative and qualitative characteristics and exponents. The

general algorithm of these changes can be determined in the following way. The structure

of the initial time series becomes more stochastic with reduction of Parkinsonian tremor

31

velocity. The increase of the number of degrees of freedom determines predominance of

Markov eﬀects, manifestation of long-range correlations and more signiﬁcant velocity of re-

laxation processes. The regularization of the initial time signal is observed with the increase

of pathological tremor velocity (when this or that treatment is stopped), i.e.

its structure

becomes more robust. This fact is reﬂected in the behavior of the physical characteristics.

The structure of phase clouds changes, the height of the peak on the characteristic frequency

in the initial TCF power spectra increases, characteristic oscillations in the frequency spec-

tra of the non-Markovity parameter appear, the value of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity

parameter on zero frequency decreases to 1.

The use of the ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy conﬁrms the conclusion about the resonant

character of the amplitude of Parkinsonian tremor velocity. It is necessary to note that the

inﬂuence of the resonant tremor component decreases, and the stochastic tremor component

increases under treatment. At the same time the analysis of spectral dependences and

diﬀerent moments of the second order, as well as the splitting of the signal into ”high-

frequency” and ”low-frequency” components have allowed to make the timely estimate of

the patient’s state (Figs. 8, 10) and the eﬃciency of diﬀerent methods of treatment (Figs. 7,

9). The estimates, which we have received, can be used to choose the ”treatment strategy”

for the patient. It is necessary to note, that the high-frequency component of pathological

tremor velocity SF (f ) is most sensitive to the changes arising in the initial time signal.

On the whole, the method of the ﬂicker-noise spectroscopy allows to reveal the set of the

eigenfrequencies and the resonant or the stochastic components of the initial time signal in

various physiological states of the patient. This method elicits additional information about

the eﬀects of dynamic alternation and the nonstationary eﬀects in the initial time series.

The methods of the time series analysis which are submitted in this paper, give a simple

quantitative method or a graphic scheme for the analysis of various physiological states of a

patient with Parkinson’s disease. Each of these methods is independent and reﬂects unique

local information about the initial time signal structure.

The obtained results allow us to use the oﬀered methods for the analysis of other com-

plex systems of biological nature. In particular, the oﬀered methods have already made it

possible to receive signiﬁcant results in the statistical analysis of the experimental data of

epidemiology, cardiology, neurophysiology and of human locomotion.

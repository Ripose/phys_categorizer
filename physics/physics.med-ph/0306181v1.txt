this paper, we present the incorporation of the αβ ﬁlter to DFA to determine patterns in the power-

involving normal and pathological circumstances were used to evaluate this process. The results
presented here suggest the existence of evolving patterns, not always following a uniform power-
law behaviour, that cannot be described by scaling exponents estimated using a linear procedure

about the nature of the data, may confer advantages to DFA by revealing more clearly abnormal
physiological conditions detected in congestive heart failure patients related to the existence of
dominant characteristic scales.

I. LEAD PARAGRAPH

Detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [1], suitable for
the analysis of nonstationary time series, has conﬁrmed
the existence of persistent long-range correlations in
healthy heart rate variability (HRV) data [2]. Notwith-
standing the early success in the application of DFA, a
limitation exists concerning the ﬁnal stage of the tech-
nique as applied to HRV. This is related to the calculation
of the power-law scaling exponent for the short-term or
long-term range, a range division that has been assumed
by the presence of the “crossover phenomenon”, or criti-
cal segment length where there is a sudden change in the
power law, found in several patients [1, 3]. We believe
that one should not reduce DFA to quantify only two (a
short- and a long-range) scaling exponents, but instead
determine if there is more information in the power-law
behaviour. A previous attempt using coarse local slopes
for the scaling exponent has already suggested a kind of
scaling stability impairment with heart disease [4]; how-
ever, a detailed analysis of the patterns of the slope is not
provided. Here, we present the incorporation of the αβ
ﬁlter to the DFA for the estimation of the power law as
a function of the time scales. The αβ ﬁlter [5] is a recur-
sive least-squares method that has been used for tracking
targets or to characterise the operation of an induction
motor drive, for example [6, 7]. We have employed this
ﬁlter as a more appropriate approach to obtain a de-
tailed analysis of the scaling behaviour by improving the
precision in the interpretation of the DFA results. Well-

known simulated scenarios and real HRV data involving
normal and pathological circumstances were used to eval-
uate this enhancement. Our results suggest the existence
of evolving scaling patterns not always presenting a uni-
form power-law behaviour that can be readily detected by
a linear slope estimation procedure over two predeﬁned
ranges. We also show that the incorporation of the study
of these patterns may confer advantages to the DFA by
revealing more clearly abnormal physiological conditions
detected in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients re-
lated to the existence of dominant characteristic scales.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, power spectral techniques have been
widely applied to short-term ﬂuctuations of the elapsed
time between consecutive heart beats or RR intervals.
Although disagreement exists about the physiological in-
formation provided by the frequency bands [8, 9, 10],
it is accepted in some circles that these tools have re-
vealed unique spectral signatures corresponding to the
autonomic control dynamics [2, 8]. Recently, this spec-
tral quantiﬁcation of the magnitude of this HRV has
been complemented with long-memory statistical mea-
surements [11] revealing, for healthy dynamics, persistent
long-range correlations over a wide range of time scales
[12]. This has promoted the adoption of a physiologi-
cal conjecture suggesting that HRV, lacking characteris-
tic scales and having long-range correlation, indicates a
healthy organising principle that seems to break down
in several pathological states. For example, a disruption
of long-range variability correlations, perhaps reﬂecting
a shift to a dominant single characteristic time scale, has
been detected in the heartbeat dynamics of CHF patients

[1, 12].

For the analysis of long-term HRV that lacks charac-
teristic scales it is appropriate to apply a fractal approach
to identify the existence of persistent correlations over a
wide range of time scales. Moreover, the introduction of
DFA [1, 13, 14] has conferred advantages over other con-
ventional fractal methods because it permits the detec-
tion of long-range correlations embedded in nonstation-
ary time series and avoids spurious detection of apparent
long-range correlations that are artifacts of nonstation-
arity behaviour [1, 15, 16, 17]. Any invariant scaling
characteristics in the heart rate ﬂuctuations obtained by
these means can therefore be mostly attributed to the
intrinsic mechanism of neuroautonomic control [17] with
the advantage of not having to rigorously control physical
activity or provide an external stimulus, hence promoting
the possibility of ambulatory monitoring for long-term
evaluation. The DFA has also been applied to detect
long-range correlations in other time series like hetero-
geneous DNA sequences and [13, 18] the stride interval
ﬂuctuations obtained from unconstrained human gait dy-
namics [12].

III. DFA AND αβ FILTER

The DFA method has been described elsewhere [1].
Brieﬂy, the original RR interval or HRV series is initially
integrated as follows:

Y (k) =

[RR(i) − RRave]

(1)

k

X
i=1

where RR(i) is the ith RR interval and RRave is the av-
erage RR interval of the series. This integration is used to
overcome both the restricted observation time and phys-
ical nature of the process. Next, the integrated series
is divided into windows, or boxes, of equal numbers of
n RR intervals. In each window, the local trend is ob-
tained by least-squared line ﬁt1. This trend is locally
subtracted from the integrated series to reduce the non-
stationary artifacts. The average root-mean-square ﬂuc-
tuation, Fm(n), is then calculated. The previous proce-
dure is repeated for all window sizes (time scales). Conse-
quently, the relationship on a double-log graph between
these ﬂuctuations Fm(n) and time scales n can be ap-
proximately evaluated by a linear model: Fm(n) ∼ nζ .

1 Higher order polynomials may also be used in this ﬁtting proce-
dure. However, it has been reported that the inherent deviations
at small scales appear to become stronger in higher order of DFA
[19, 20]. Additionally, crossovers produced by sinusoidal trends,
like the ones analysed in this contribution, are shifted to larger
values for higher orders of detrending [19, 20]. Finally, HRV data
have been normally analysed using linear detrending DFA which
is the order that we employed in this study.

2

A resulting slope, or scaling exponent ζ, of 0.5 indicates
white noise and the absence of long-range correlations,
an exponent of 1 reﬂects the behaviour of a 1/f process
having persistent long-range correlations whilst the slope
of 1.5 indicates a random walk (Brownian noise) with a
very smooth behaviour where correlations still exist but
not in a power-law form2.

The scaling exponent of the average root-mean-
squared ﬂuctuations as a function of time scales is usu-
ally estimated by the slope of the double-log plot cov-
ering short- or long-term ranges. Rather than ﬁnding
the scaling exponent only for these two generally prede-
ﬁned ranges, in this paper we have adopted the αβ ﬁlter
[5, 6, 7, 21] to recursively estimate a local least-squares
ﬁtting for tracking the evolution of the gradient (i.e., of
the power law) as a function of log time scales (or win-
dow sizes). This gradient is also referred to in this paper
as scaling pattern.

Essentially, the αβ ﬁlter [5] is a simpliﬁed version of a
Kalman ﬁlter that provides a good compromise between
performance and computational load [21]. By adopting
a recursive approach to the estimate of DFA scaling pat-
terns we have assumed a constant local slope in these
patterns. Obviously, it is necessary to consider that this
slope may involve variations from linearity. These vari-
ations are modelled in the Kalman ﬁlter as plant noise
[21]. By contrast, in the αβ ﬁlter, plant noise is implic-
itly assumed to be zero [5, 21]. However, the eﬀects of
plant noise may also be simulated by preventing the αβ
ﬁlter gains from going to zero (see equations 7–8)[21].
Thus, it is not necessary to know the exact model of the
local slopes and consequently the αβ ﬁlter can be used
with the advantage of reducing the number of required
operations. A brief description of how the αβ ﬁlter was
incorporated to DFA (equations 2–8) is presented next.
Let Gm(n) be the log of the average root-mean-squared
ﬂuctuations, Fm(n), produced by DFA at the window
size n, with n being the number of RR intervals (or the
equivalent physiological time scale). Deﬁne me(n) as the
required estimate of the gradient at the log window size
n. Since a logarithmic representation of the window size
n is employed, an initial interpolation of Gm(n) is con-
venient to have it parameterised by a uniformly sampled
variable in the logarithmic representation of the window
size domain; using k as an index to denote the discrete
elements or samples of this new variable. Then, it is
possible to predict the value of the root-mean-squared
ﬂuctuations at k according to

Gp(k) = Ge(k − 1) + me(k − 1)δ

(2)

2 In spite of recognising that α has been the notation extensively
used elsewhere to describe the fractal scaling exponent, we have
used instead the notation ζ to avoid creating confusion with the
αβ ﬁlter concept described in this paper.

where Gp(k) is the predicted log root-mean-squared ﬂuc-
tuations, Ge(k − 1) is the estimate of log root-mean-
squared ﬂuctuations at k − 1, and δ is the uniform sepa-
ration between successive elements of the parameterised
variable. The original piece of information, i.e., the log
root-mean-squared ﬂuctuations Gm(k), produced by the
DFA method at k, is combined with the previous predic-
tion Gp(k) according to

Ge(k) = [1 − α(k)]Gp(k) + α(k)Gm(k)

(3)

in order to obtain the estimate of the log root-mean-
squared ﬂuctuations at k. Here, α(k) is a smoothing
coeﬃcient at k. Finally, the desired estimate of the gra-
dient at k, me(k), can be obtained from

me(k) = me(k − 1) +

[Gm(k) − Gp(k)]

To take into account any possible deviation from lin-
earity in the log domain (perhaps owing to oscillatory
trends [19] or to ﬁnite-length eﬀects [22]) in the root-
mean-squared ﬂuctuations produced by the DFA method,
the coeﬃcients α(k) and β(k) are prevented from going
to zero for k > Q as follows:

α(k) = α(Q)
β(k) = β(Q)

where for our analysis we empirically found a value
Q=500 as a balance between “over smoothing” at high Q
where changes in the gradient are not adequately tracked,
and “under smoothing” where the eﬀects of noise become
signiﬁcant.

IV. DATA TO BE ANALYSED

The incorporation of this αβ ﬁlter to the DFA was
initially explored with simulated data having 100800
samples (approximately corresponding to the amount
of RR intervals recorded during 24 hours at 70 beats
per minute). These simulations involved Gaussian white
noise series; Brownian motion series (obtained by the in-
tegration of the white noise series [23]); 1/f γ process

3

(γ = 1) generated by the spectral synthesis approxi-
mation suggested by Suape [23]; and ﬁnally 1/f series
including superimposed oscillatory trends introduced by
the addition to the previous 1/f series of a pure sine
component with 0.01 Hz frequency and an amplitude of
0.1.

In addition, the above mentioned methods were ap-
plied to 18 normal sinus HRV long-term records (20-24
hours) from subjects without diagnosed cardiac abnor-
malities as well as 15 long-term records (20 hours) from
subjects with severe CHF. The unaudited RR annotation
marks of these records were gathered from PhysioNet
[24]. The CHF records have also been used elsewhere
[1] to explore the DFA capabilities. This database in-
cludes long-term ECG recordings from 15 subjects (11
men, aged 22 to 71, and 4 women, aged 54 to 63). The
normal sinus heart rate database was obtained from sub-
jects found to have no signiﬁcant arrhythmias; they in-
cluded 5 men, aged 26 to 45, and 13 women aged 20 to
50 [24]. The annotation marks were analysed to remove
unqualiﬁed sinus beats, these outliers being detected ac-
cording to the method suggested in Ref. [25], which relies
upon conﬁrming each RR interval to be within a toler-
ance range covering the 20% extremes from a running
mean value obtained through the 4 adjacent intervals.
Only recordings with more than 85% qualiﬁed beats were
included in the analysis as suggested in Ref. [26]. Thus,
records CHF02 and CHF06 were excluded from the anal-
ysis of the CHF database.

Finally, since it has been reported that day-night diﬀer-
ences exist in the scaling behaviour of HRV data [17], the
enhanced DFA analysis (i.e., DFA plus αβ ﬁlter) was also
applied separately to wake and sleep 6 hours segments of
normal and CHF data.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figures 1, 2, and 3 present the result of the DFA and
αβ ﬁlter applied to the following simulated series: Gaus-
sian white noise, Brownian motion, and 1/f noise. The
top of each ﬁgure shows the double-log plot of the average
root-mean ﬂuctuations Fm(n) as a function of the win-
dow size n obtained using DFA whilst the bottom ﬁgure
corresponds to the gradient me(n) of these ﬂuctuations,
again as a function of the log window size, estimated
by the αβ ﬁlter. Note that although the original se-
ries length was 100800 samples, corresponding to the log
range of 5, these plots cover window sizes up to log value
4 to avoid presenting the larger deviations resulting from
the ﬁnite-length eﬀects of the data [3, 22] (which can be
also explained as being related to averaging over too few
windows giving only rough detrending with the eﬀects of
noise becoming more signiﬁcant). These type of results
have been reported elsewhere [20], but for the purpose of
this contribution they are useful to promote familiarisa-
tion with the type of scaling patterns obtained via the αβ
ﬁlter in well-characterised scenarios. As was expected for

these simulations the scaling pattern reveals the theoret-
ical value of 0.5 for white noise, 1.5 for Brownian noise,
and 1 for the 1/f series. The gradient patterns in these
ﬁgures conﬁrm that the expected scaling behaviours were
only approached asymptotically, as has been explained in
Ref. [19] because of the intrinsic deviations of the DFA
method for small window sizes 3. Additionally, as re-
ported by Hu et. al.
[20], it is possible to appreciate
that these deviations present larger scaling values than
the expected behaviour for white noise whereas for the
Brownian noise and 1/f series these deviations resulted
in smaller values.

Figure 4 presents the results of the DFA and αβ ﬁl-
ter applied to 1/f noise with a superimposed oscilla-
tory trend. The estimated scaling pattern presented at
the bottom of the ﬁgure clearly reveals a strong devia-
tion in the linearity of the double-log plot (see Figure 3
for a comparison of the scaling behaviour obtained when
analysing an uncorrupted 1/f process). The addition of
this oscillatory trend has produced the type of “crossover
phenomenon” suggested in Ref. [1]. A reliable detection
of this phenomenon is possible with the gradient, esti-
mated by the αβ ﬁlter, indicating a clear deviation from
a uniform power law mostly because of a well-deﬁned
projection above unity within the log window size range
of 1.5 to 2.2. This range includes the log window size
2 as the location presenting the major deviating eﬀect.
Hence, this is related to the superimposed trend having
an oscillatory frequency of 0.01 Hz and a regular sam-
pling frequency of 1 Hz (see also Kantelhardt et. al. [19]
and Hu et. al. [20] for simulations and detailed analytical
calculations of how a sinusoidal trend aﬀects the scaling
behaviour of correlated noise).

As suggested by the result of Figure 4, a complemen-
tary exploration of the addition of a second sine compo-
nent of lower frequency (0.001 Hz) and same amplitude
should reveal an additional projection in the log 3 long-
term range. The corresponding results for this scenario
are presented in Figure 5 where it is possible to conﬁrm
this prediction.

The top of Figure 6 presents a typical scaling pattern
for a normal patient (18184). It is possible to describe
two major features in the evolution of this pattern. For
the long-term range, the power scaling pattern asymp-
totically attains a plateau having a value near unity; by
analogy with the pattern obtained for the 1/f simula-
tion (Figure 3) it is clear that this result (top of Figure
6) suggests persistent correlations and the lack of char-
acteristic scales in the long range in accordance with the
hypothesis of healthy heart rate presenting a type of 1/f
ﬂuctuations [1, 12]. In contrast, for the short time scales
it is possible to appreciate deviations above unity, from

3 It is important to mention that these deviations are not only in-
trinsic to DFA. For example, deviations from an expected scaling
behaviour at small scales have also been described in the context
of Hurst analysis [27]

a uniform power-law pattern, again in accordance with
the results of Peng et. al., who have explained that this
deviation is probably the result of the relatively smooth
heartbeat oscillations, associated with respiration, that
dominate the short-term range [1].

For the case presented at the top of Figure 6 it is clear,
as reported in Ref. [1], that in principle it would be possi-
ble to arrive at the same kind of conclusions by assuming
the existence of a crossover phenomenon. The use of the
conventional linear quantiﬁcation in predeﬁned ranges at
the top of Figure 6 would assign the exponents for short-
term (n from 4 to 16) and long-term (n from 100 to
10000) ranges of 1.09 and 1.10, respectively. However,
the evolving scaling pattern produced by the αβ ﬁlter,
showing a considerable variation in the short-term range,
indicates that an exponent of 1.09 is a gross approxima-
tion for this behaviour. Hence, further information may
be revealed with this scaling pattern analysis that is not
possible to detect by the conventional interpretation of
the DFA results. Other advantages obtained by the incor-
poration of αβ ﬁlter will be illustrated with the following
results.

The bottom of Figure 6 presents the scaling pattern for
another normal patient (19090). Concerning the short-
term range it is possible to conﬁrm a similar and perhaps
normal deviation above unity that was also found in the
top of Figure 6.
In contrast, an unexpected feature is
detected in the long-term range where it is possible to
appreciate a deviation from a uniform power law. By
analogy with the pattern of the simulation of 1/f ﬂuctu-
ations with the superimposed oscillatory trends (Figure
4), it is possible to suggest therefore for this patient the
appearance of a very low frequency characteristic scale
(reﬂected in the existence of a small but well deﬁned
projection in the long-term range of log 3 to 3.5). A
larger than unity scaling exponent in the conventional
DFA would approximately detect this deviation only if
an appropriately reduced range (e.g., log n from 3 to
3.5) for the linear slope estimation were selected. How-
ever, it would be impossible to select this corresponding
range without further analysis and it is also clear that
again a linear model, which revealed a short-term expo-
nent of 1.12 (n from 4 to 16) and a long-term exponent of
1.02 (n from 100 to 10000), is not the best approximation
for quantifying this type of scaling pattern. Hence, the
analysis of the scaling pattern provided by the applica-
tion of the αβ ﬁlter confers the advantage, with no need
of initial assumptions, of revealing for this case a clear
behaviour that can be associated with a slow and weak
oscillatory trend, or characteristic scale, in the HRV.

Concerning the rest of the normal group, Figure 7 in-
cludes scaling patterns of another 6 patients apparently
showing, like the top of Figure 6, both deviations above
unity in short-term range and uniform power law in the
long-term range. However, Figure 8 presents the scaling
patterns of the remaining 10 normal patients where it is
also possible to appreciate, as at the bottom of Figure 6,
that a uniform power law in the long-term range is not

the bottom plot presents me(n) vs log n estimated by αβ ﬁlter. Values of log n go up to 4 to avoid presenting larger deviations
resulting from the ﬁnite-length eﬀects. Horizontal dashed lines in the bottom plot indicate the scaling exponent values 0.5 (W),

always manifested. Moreover, there are 3 cases in this
ﬁgure (16420, 16795 and 17052) not necessarily showing
the type of deviations above unity in short-term range
similar to the ones depicted at the top of Figure 6 or in
Figure 7.

Figure 9 presents a typical scaling pattern for a CHF
patient (CHF03). The pattern obtained by the αβ ﬁl-
ter clearly reveals major deviations, or projections, from
a uniform power law in the intermediate and long-term
range. In addition, a scaling pattern below unity, close
to 0.5 (i.e., white noise), can be appreciated in the short-
term range. The conventional DFA method has already
revealed a very diﬀerent behaviour in the scaling expo-
nent of CHF patients [1]; there, it was reported that for
short time scales, the scaling exponents were below unity
whilst for long-term range it was reported that the scal-
ing exponents were above unity. The resulting scaling

pattern of Figure 9 provided by the application of the
αβ ﬁlter enhances the understanding of this abnormal
behaviour. By analogy with the simulated results pre-
sented in Figures 4 and 5, it is clear that the elevated
value for the scaling exponent in the long-term range
[1] is here shown in Figure
that was reported in Ref.
9 to be related with the existence of predominant char-
acteristic scales. Although the existence of a character-
istic scale for the explanation of the abnormal scaling
exponent was initially postulated in Ref. [1], the scaling
patterns obtained by the αβ ﬁlter conﬁrm and comple-
ment this explanation. The major deviations of Figure 9
seem to reveal not only one but two characteristic scales
with potential physiological information that clearly can-
not be properly detected by linear slope estimations over
predeﬁned ranges. This is illustrated in the top plot of
Figure 9 presenting the linear best ﬁt for the range n of

100 to 10000 that clearly misses the underlying pattern;
resulting slope=1.23 .
It seems necessary therefore to
postulate that there could be more than one crossover
phenomenon for the behaviour of this scaling pattern.

It is important to report that for 8 additional CHF
patients (Figure 10), the scaling patterns also presented
deviations from a uniform power law that, as in Figure
9, suggest the existence of two characteristic scales in
the intermediate and long-term ranges. These ﬁndings
conﬁrm the inadequacy of the conventional linear best ﬁt
to completely represent the underlying patterns revealed
by DFA. In addition, like in Figure 9, it was also possible
to observe in these 8 cases signiﬁcant deviations below
unity (toward 0.5) in the short-term range. This type of
behaviour, similar to white noise, could be related to a
marked attenuation of rhythmic oscillations [28] probably
indicating that in CHF the integrity of the autonomic
mechanisms that regulate the RR intervals over short-
time scales is aﬀected. Additionally, this attenuation may

also be related to poor end-organ responses [29].

Interestingly, the remaining CHF patients (Figure 11)
also appear to present characteristic scales in the inter-
mediate and long-term ranges but not signiﬁcant devia-
tions below unity in the short-term range. Hence, it could
be speculated that the manifestation of CHF in these 4
patients was not as severe as in the cases presented in
Figure 10. Consequently, this observation suggests that
by performing a more detailed analysis of the scaling be-
haviour, as opposed to a conventional linear characteri-
sation, it would be possible to recover information about
the degree of severity of the CHF condition.

Having presented the results of CHF patients, it is then
possible to describe additional features that were identi-
ﬁed in the result of normal patients. In particular, scal-
ing patterns 16420, 18177, 16795, and 17052 (Figure 8)
appear to weakly show the type of characteristic devi-
ations presented by the CHF group (ﬁgures 10 and 11).
Hence, it is speculated that the exploration of scaling pat-

these perhaps expressed as subclinical manifestations of
the cardio-respiratory control.

To summarise, Figure 12 presents the mean scaling
pattern obtained from the 18 cases in the normal group
(Figures 6, 7 and 8) as well as the same mean for the
13 cases in the CHF group (Figures 9, 10 and 11). Also
depicted in this ﬁgure are error bars (mean ± 1 standard
deviation) at diﬀerent log n scales. Here, it is possible
to appreciate that these scaling patterns have recovered
the main features that we described for the normal and
CHF groups (i.e., deviations above unity in the short-
term range and uniform power law in the long-term range
for normal patients, whereas CHF patients present devia-
tions below unity in short-term range and two character-
istic scales in the intermediate and long-term range). In-
terestingly, in spite of identifying in Figure 12 some scales
showing an overlap in the error bars for both groups, it is
also possible to detect particular scales without overlap

in the short-term, intermediate, and long-term ranges so
proving distinctive behaviour between groups. Addition-
ally, the apparently larger error bars in the CHF scaling
pattern may indicate the type of scaling instability in
these patients that was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Viswanathan
et. al.[4].

Finally, to show other examples of the advantages of
analysing the scaling pattern without assuming prede-
ﬁned ranges or uniform power-law behaviour, ﬁgures 13
and 14 present the results of the DFA and the αβ ﬁlter
applied separately to wake and sleep 6 hours segments
of normal (16265) and CHF (CHF07) data. As reported
in [17], using conventional quantiﬁcation of the scaling
behaviour (see top plots), it is possible to appreciate,
both for the normal and CHF cases, sleep-wake diﬀer-
ences in the long-term scaling exponents, ﬁnding smaller
exponents during the sleep period. The scaling patterns
at the bottom of the plots appear to provide additional
information about these diﬀerences.

For the normal case 16265 (Figure 13) it is clear that
there is a wake to sleep reduction in the scaling be-
haviour in the short-term range whereas for the inter-
mediate range there is a marked scaling increase forming
a type of plateau. Additionally, and this explains the
reduction of the scaling exponent, there is a signiﬁcant
change of the long-term uniform power law toward a be-
haviour below unity. Clearly, the scaling pattern of this
case obtained from the entire data set (≃ 24 hours) and
shown in Figure 7, appears to include features of both
wake and sleep segments. Hence, this pattern is not nec-
essarily dominated by the scaling pattern of the wake
segment, an observation that was suggested in Ref. [17],
as a result of using a single exponent to characterise the
data in the long-term range. On the contrary, this scaling
pattern seems to be in accordance with results reported
in [30] showing that for signals comprised of segments
with diﬀerent local properties, the scaling behaviour is a
superposition of the behaviour of diﬀerent components.

However, in that contribution [30] it is also considered
that the scaling behaviour is dominated by segments ex-
hibiting higher positive correlation.

For the case CHF7 (Figure 14) it is possible to appre-
ciate an intermediate characteristic scale in the scaling
patterns of both sleep and wake segments. However,
that projection appears to be more prominent during
the sleep segment. Thus, this seems to be new infor-
mation provided by the scaling patterns that cannot be
inferred via the reduction of the scaling exponent (shown
at the top of the plot). Clearly, the linear best ﬁt misses
the underlying pattern that reveals the existence of this
characteristic scale around the log 2 range. Interestingly,
according to this range and the mean RR interval, this
characteristic scale having ≃ 0.01 Hz could be the re-
sult of the abnormal heart rate oscillations associated
with Cheyne-Stokes respiration that is commonly found
in CHF patients [1, 31, 32].

Concerning the long-term range of Figure 14 it is pos-

sible to appreciate that the characteristic scale around
the log 3 range which is present during wake period is no
longer identiﬁed in the sleep segment. However, the scal-
ing pattern of this segment shows a new deviation in the
long-term range toward Brownian noise behaviour dur-
ing the sleep segment. Once again, the scaling pattern
of this case obtained from the entire record (≃ 20 hours)
shown in Figure 10 includes features of both wake and
sleep segments.

The smaller values of the scaling exponent during the
sleep segments shown in ﬁgures 13 and 14 have been sug-
gested in Ref. [17] to be the result of a stronger neuroau-
tonomic control during sleep periods. It remains to be
seen in which sense this hypothesis is supported by the
additional information described earlier from the scaling
patterns.

In this contribution several characteristic features have
been detected in scaling patterns of HRV data of either
normal or CHF patients. Hence, it is obviously diﬃ-

cult to suggest a single measurement to characterise these
patterns. This circumstance may appear as a practical
disadvantage of studying in detail the scaling behaviour
using procedures like the αβ ﬁlter. However, our re-
sults suggest that DFA involves potential information
that appears to be ignored by not using a more suit-
able model to characterise the scaling behaviour. Con-
sequently, this contribution may promote further studies
involving larger groups aimed to obtain representative
scaling patterns to typify diﬀerent cohorts. Thus, new
cases could be confronted with these representative pat-
terns to determine the degree of similarity between them.
Interestingly, this comparison could then be performed
via single values obtained, for example, from measure-
ments like the rms diﬀerence between candidates and rep-
resentative patterns or from measurements obtained by a
more sophisticated pattern recognition approach. These
values would be useful to perform statistical comparisons
or to assess severity of alterations in scaling patterns.

VI. CONCLUSION

the tests used to reveal cardiac abnormalities.

It has been suggested that the breakdown of persistent
correlations over a wide range of time scales in HRV could
be related to pathological conditions [12]. The pattern
analysis of the power-law behaviour that we present here
via the incorporation of the αβ ﬁlter supports and reveals
strong deviations from a uniform power law in CHF con-
ditions owing to a type of white noise behaviour and the
existence of dominant characteristic scales. However, it
is also suggested that caution should be taken about the
existence of characteristic scales as precise indicators of
nonhealthy dynamics. This is because some of the nor-
mal control patients also weakly presented characteris-
tic scales in the long-term range, suggesting that either
these types of deviations from a uniform power law are
not necessary abnormal conditions or that these patients
had subclinical manifestations that were not detected by

Our results suggest the existence of variations in the
DFA scaling pattern of the heart rate ﬂuctuations with
potential information that cannot be detected by linear-
slope estimation procedures over predeﬁned ranges. This
exponent appears to be, consequently, a very rough ap-
proximation even for data from normal patients that are
currently assumed to have in general a uniform power
law in the long-term range. The incorporation of the αβ
ﬁlter appears as a convenient analytical improvement for
the reliable estimation of these scaling patterns by avoid-
ing initial assumptions or previous considerations about
the nature of the data, or by avoiding a procedure like
the one suggested by Hu et. al. [20] to ﬁnd an optimal
ﬁtting range. It is argued in this work that this incor-
poration of the αβ ﬁlter is a valuable tool for an appro-
priate analysis of complex data series like HRV, where
the mechanisms underlying the power-law behaviour of

these ﬂuctuations still remain to be clearly elucidated.
Hence, this technique will be of value in investigating
whether, as some studies have suggested, endocrinal,
hemodynamic, autonomic, and conscious states are fac-
tors involved [3, 33, 34, 35], as well as the role played by
the intrinsic nature of cardiac tissue [36].

FIG. 13: Result of DFA and αβ ﬁlter applied separately to wake (12-6 p.m.) and sleep (12-6 a.m.) periods of normal patient
16265. Top plots show log Fm(n) vs log n obtained via DFA including a least-squares ﬁt for 60≤ n ≤3500 as reported in
Ref. [17]. Also indicated are the resulting scaling exponents. Bottom plots present corresponding me(n) vs log n estimated by
αβ ﬁlter. Arrows indicate plateau in the intermediate range and diﬀerent behaviour in long-term range.

FIG. 14: Result of DFA and αβ ﬁlter applied separately to wake (1-7 p.m.) and sleep (12-6 a.m.) periods of CHF patient
CHF07. Top plots show log Fm(n) vs log n obtained via DFA including a least-squares ﬁt for 60≤ n ≤3500 as reported
in Ref. [17]. Also indicated are the resulting scaling exponents. Bottom plots present corresponding me(n) vs log n estimated
by αβ ﬁlter. Arrows indicate the existence of intermediate characteristic scale.

We report the development of a scalar quantization approach that helps build tables of deci-
sion and reconstruction levels for any probability density function (pdf). Several example pdf’s
are used for illustration: Uniform, Gaussian, Laplace, one-sided Rayleigh, and Gamma (One sided
and double-sided symmetrical). The main applications of the methodology are principally aimed at
Multiresolution Image compression where generally the Stretched Exponential pdf is encountered.
Specialising to this important case, we perform quantization and information entropy calculations
from selected medical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) pictures of the human brain. The im-
age histograms are ﬁtted to a Stretched exponential model and the corresponding entropies are
compared.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This research attempts at developing an information
preserving image coding suitable for handling medical
images which usually do not allow any degree of image
degradation in comparison with the source images [1, 2].
JPEG, one of the well accepted compression standards,
exhibits an excellent compression gain, but does not
insure that the decoded result is the exact replica of
the original. A variation of DPCM or pixel diﬀerence
coding, namely ”Guided Scan Pixel Diﬀerence Coding
was studied. A major modiﬁcation to the classical
in terms
DPCM is the inclusion of scan information,
of the direction used to calculate the pixel diﬀerence
information does not
and step size. This additional
signiﬁcantly increase the volume of coded data.
It
actually opens the extensibility for the DPCM to be able
to handle multi-dimensional image data,
in a similar
manner as JPEG is extended to MPEG to handle movie
presentation. Another important asp ect of medical
image coding, which is the ability to access the full
details of a local image (often referred to as ROI, Region
of Interest), is also satisﬁed. Neither the location of a
ROI nor the scanning method is restricted so that a local
area of ROI can be selected anywhere in the original
image. The ﬂexibility in scanning makes it possible to
use the same code for real time movie presentation in the
same way MPEG uses JPEG. This research considers
two stage redundancy removal, one by taking pixel
diﬀerences and the other by an entropic source coding
similar to the Huﬀman coding to achieve a redundancy
removal of approximately 4-5 bpp (bits per pixel).

The sizes of medical images have increased with the
imaging modalities,
advancement in various medical
typically in MRI and X-ray CAT scan. MRI can scan
a whole body within a reasonable time of 30 minutes
and X-ray CAT has adopted helical scanning for a

higher spatial resolution.
In the case of 3D scanning,
the image size could be as large as 100 million pixels.
Images of this size are usually stored on writable laser
disks (CD-WORM), but this imposes serious problems
when the retrieval of such data is attempted through a
communication channel in the wide area network (WAN)
environment using 64 kbits/sec bit-rate telephone chan-
nels.

The problems associated with the compression of med-
ical images are two fold. The ﬁrst requirement is that
compression must be absolutely non-degradable. Regard-
less of whether a picture has been aﬀected by measure-
ment noise that occurs in the process of physical mea-
surement and in image reconstruction, the source data
acquired at an imager must be retained without any kind
of losses. The second condition is the integrity of the ob-
jects contained in a picture data. Physicians examine
very closely the image in a ROI (Region of Interest) or
a number of ROI’s. A selected ROI needs to be imme-
diately accessible and it must be translated into a serial
stream of compressed data for transmission via a com-
munication channel.

II. LLOYD-MAX QUANTIZATION
FUNDAMENTALS

The scalar quantization problem entails the speciﬁca-
tion of a set of decision levels dj and a set of reconstruc-
tion levels rj in a way such that some quantization error
measure is minimized. The Lloyd-Max algorithm is based
on the minimization of the mean-square error deﬁned as:

= E[(x

ˆx)2] =

dx p(x)(x

has to have a good guess for the starting value r0
otherwise one will converge to the local minmium
and not the global one.

Where the probability density function (pdf) p(x) is
deﬁned over the interval [a, b]. E is the expectation value
with respect to the pdf p(x) and ˆx is the mean value
with respect to p(x). The total number of levels J = 2nb
depends on the number nb of available bits to encode
them. Considering
a function of all the rj and the dj
levels, the minimum of the mean-square error is obtained
with respect to the rj and
by taking the derivatives of
E
the dj. This yields the coupled sets of equations (j =
1, ...J):

Simplifying, these equations are rewritten as:

dx p(x)

These sets of equations form the Lloyd-Max algorithm.
Starting from some initial value r0 the Lloyd-Max set
of equations will allow us to calculate all the decision
and reconstruction levels.
In fact, it appears that the
error
is a function of r0 only when we are dealing with
the mean-square error quantization. The pseudo-code
algorithm is therefore:

end

The above algorithm has two main ingredients:

•

•

A minimization procedure to ﬁnd the optimal value
of the starting reconstruction level r0.

A root-solving procedure allowing the determina-
tion of dj+1 from rj and dj with an implicit func-
tion [5] of dj+1 which is the ratio of two integrals.

Several diﬃculties might arise:

1. The function

(r0) is highly singular with many lo-
cal minima separarted by large values of the func-
tion as illustrated in Figure 1. This means that one

E

2. The integrals appearing in [2] should be calcu-
lated with a very high accuracy despite the fact we
are dealing with very rapidly exponential functions
in the integrand (this is the case of the Laplace,
Gamma, Rayleigh, Gaussian and Stretched expo-
nential pdf’s. The Uniform distribution does not
have these problems but many other pdf’s contain
an exponential term).

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM

AND APPLICATIONS

E

We have implemented an algorithm based on an ana-
lytical approach that will deal with an integrand contain-
ing arbitrary powers of x and an exponential function of
an arbitrary power of x. The minimization procedure is
handled graphically within the software by plotting the
function
(r0) over a large interval, allowing the approx-
imate location of the starting point that will drive the
search towards the global minimum region.
Several examples will be treated below and look-up ta-
bles are given for the levels for a quantization based on
an arbitrary number of bits. Some of these tables are
compared to highly accurate published tables and new
tables are given for the stretched exponential pdf needed
in mutiresolution image processing. The various pdf that
are illustrated below are:

Four bit quantization tables of decision and recon-
struction levels for all the above double-sided pdf in the
case the mean µ = 0 and the standard deviation ∆x = 1
are given in Tables 1-7 and are compared to published
values in Table 8 and 9.

For the one-sided Rayleigh and Gamma pdf’s we con-
sider the case where the standard deviation ∆x = 1 (For
the one-sided Gamma pdf we take α = 1.2). The α pa-
rameter of the stretched exponential pdf with mean µ = 0
and standard deviation ∆x = 1 can be set arbitrarily. We
set it to 1.2 as in the one-sided Gamma pdf. Figures 2
and 3 illustrate the reconstruction levels versus the de-
cision levels in the case the number of bits is 6. The
quantized levels are shown for the Uniform, Gaussian,
Laplace, Symmetric Gamma, Stretched exponential and
the one-sided Rayleigh and Gamma pdf’s. All symmetric
pdf’s have (µ = 0 and ∆x = 1) whereas the one-sided
pdf’s have ∆x = 1.

IV. MULTIRESOLUTION AND MEDICAL
IMAGE PROCESSING

From a histogram of an image pixel intensities, we
evaluate the absolute mean
and standard deviation
µ
|
|
σ and extract from them the parameters α and β of the
stretched exponential probability density function given
by Eq.12.

Following [1], we perform ﬁrstly the extraction of the

parameter β from the equation:

where, the function F is deﬁned by:

and α is deﬁned by:

F (β) =

µ2
σ2 + µ2

F (x) =

2
Γ( 2
x )
x )Γ( 3
x )

Γ( 1

α =

(σ2 + µ2)Γ( 1
β )
Γ( 3
β )

µ is equal to the ordinary mean, since the histogram
function of a picture is deﬁned for positive values of the
intensity levels. The entropy (in bits/pixel) is given by
the formula:

H = 2K

(
−

α
β

ln K)Γ( 1

β ) + Γ(1 + 1
β )
ln 2

(18)

In Fig.4 we display the variation of H as a function
of α in the interval
[0.1-5] for a given β picked in
the interval [0.8-1.5]. Similarly, we show in Fig.5 the
variation of H as a function of β in the interval [0.1-5]
for a given α picked in the interval [0.8-1.5].

Once the parameters α and β have been determined for
a particular image along with its corresponding entropy,
we proceed to the quantization procedure. We have
implemented the simple Lloyd-Max algorithm [2,3] that
minimizes the quantization error for the stretched expo-
nential pdf. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the reconstruction
levels versus the decision levels in the case the number of
bits is 6 and the values α = 1.2 and β = 1.56. The quan-
tized levels are compared to the Gaussian and Laplace
cases for the same number of bits. In the stretched expo-
nential case, an arbitrary value of α is valid in order to
have µ = 0 and σ = 1. Choosing α = 1.2 as in the one-
sided Gamma pdf, β is obtained as a solution of Eq.17.
As a speciﬁc illustration of our methodology, we take
two medical images (MRI-T1 format images of human
brain sections) and apply the above analysis. The

histograms of the images and the Stretched exponential
ﬁts are shown in ﬁgures 6 and 7, whereas the values
of α and β along with the entropies are given in Table 10.

V. CONCLUSION

We have developed an Lloyd-Max type algorithm to
build several quantization tables for arbitrary pdf’s. We
have considered symmetric and single-sided pdf’s. Our
results agree with published values in the 4-bit quantiza-

4

tion case and outperform them in accuracy. In the case
of medical images, we develop a ﬁtting procedure to the
Stretched exponential case by taking raw histograms of
the brain MRI images.

TABLE IX: Published values of reconstruction and decision levels for Symmetric Double-sided Uniform, Gaussian, Laplace and
Gamma pdf’s. The number of quantization bits ranges from 1 to 4. Only positive values are given. Several misprints and
missing entries are found in the table. For instance in the Uniform case the last entry 1.73205 (given in Table 1) is missing.
The entry ∞ is missing in the Laplace case. In the Double-sided Gamma pdf, the entries 0.051 and 1.390 are wrong as shown
in Table 5. The last entry ∞ is also missing. Adapted from [7].

TABLE X: Characteristics of the MRI images and values of α and β from the stretched exponential ﬁt to the histograms along
with the entropies from the raw histograms.

FIG. 1: Behaviour of the quantization error versus the ﬁrst reconstructed level r0. The presence of several local minima
surrounded by large values of the error is the reason why the search for the global minimum is diﬃcult when the starting guess
value is far away.

The various human brain tasks are performed at diﬀerent locations and time scales. Yet, we
discovered the existence of time-invariant (above an essential time scale) partitioning of the brain
activity into person-speciﬁc frequency bands. For that, we perform temporal and ensemble averaging
of best wavelet packet bases from multi-electrode EEG recordings. These personal frequency-bands
provide new templates for quantitative analyses of brain function, e.g., normal vs. epileptic activity.

Keywords: wavelet packets, best basis, electrocorticogram

Introduction. The various brain tasks (cognitive,
sensory, motor etc.) are performed simultaneously in
many locations and operate at diﬀerent time scales. In
order to quantify abnormal vs. normal brain function,
as in the case of epilepsy, it is necessary to develop time-
invariant templates for characterization of normal behav-
ior. The challenge is to decipher time-invariant features
from multi-electrode EEG recordings of brain activity.
Moreover, from Physics perspective, it is not clear a pri-
ori that time-invariant elements do exist since the activity
is inherently nonergodic.
Here we present a new approach of temporal and en-
semble averaging of best-bases constructed from Wavelet
Packets Decomposition (WPD) of the recorded brain ac-
tivity. The approach is illustrated via the analysis of sub-
dural EEG (ECoG) recordings from grids of electrodes
that are placed directly on the surface of the cortex (Fig.
1). Such recordings are performed to analyze the brain
activity of epileptic patients under chronic evaluation be-
fore resection surgery to remove the epileptic focus or foci
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Using this approach, we discovered the ex-
istence of time-invariant person-speciﬁc frequency bands
above an essential time scale of about 2.5 minutes. We
devised a quantitative measure for comparison between
WPD bases. Our new analysis approach can help, for
example, in the identiﬁcation of the epileptic foci and
in the development of quantitative analysis methods for
early warning of epileptic seizures. As a self-consistency
test that the frequency bands are not an artifact of the
analysis, we show that the same templates are obtained
for subdural and scalp EEG recordings of the same per-
son.
The recorded ECoG signals. The signals analyzed
here are ECoG recordings from grids of typically ∼100
electrodes. These recordings are obtained from epileptic
patients undergoing chronic evaluation for surgery. The
electrodes are spatially distributed over the suspected fo-
cal region, so that the focus or foci could be localized
by analyzing the ensemble of signals. The amplitude
of the signals records the electrical voltage at each elec-
trode (arguably recording local ﬁeld potentials [LFP] [5]).

(b) Voltage traces
of ECoG signals. A 10 second time window display of voltage
traces of 10 electrodes, taken from a multi-electrode recording of
96 electrodes.

The voltage signals are simultaneously digitized at 112Hz
(sampling time interval ∆tmin ≃ 9 mSec) with a lowpass
ﬁlter up to 40Hz. The analysis is usually performed in
time windows of Nbin = 1024 samples.
Time-Frequency analysis.
In general, the possible
time intervals for a recorded sequence of Nbin elements
can range from ∆tmin = 1 (in units of the sampling time
interval) to ∆tmax = Nbin.
In principle, one can ex-
tract information about Nbin time intervals at each of
the Nbin temporal locations along the sequence. How-
ever, such an N 2
bin matrix for a sequence of only Nbin
data samples must contain redundant information (i.e.
over-complete representation of the recorded sequence).
In order to avoid such redundancy, only Nbin time-
frequency locations should be selected, subject to the
uncertainty constraint between time and frequency reso-
lutions - ∆t · ∆f = 1.
Since there are Nbin corresponding frequency bands,
ranging from ∆fmin = 1/Nbin to ∆fmax = 1 (in units
of the Nyquist frequency), each location can be as-
signed a local relative resolution ∆t/∆f out of NR =
1 + log2(Nbin) possible ratios (for simplicity, Nbin of the
sequences considered here are in factors of 2). It is conve-
nient to illustrate both constraints as tiling of the time-
frequency plane with Nbin rectangles, each with its own
aspect ratio (height ∆f and width ∆t), representing the

tribution in the frequency bands of the best basis (darker shades

tion distribution shown in (b) would simply be a sum over the rows
of the basis coeﬃcients.

relative resolutions in time and frequency [6, 7].
The WPD as a binary tree. The Wavelet Packets De-
composition we use here was devised to partition (tile)
the time-frequency plane into such rectangles (referred
to as ’information cells’ or ’Heisenberg boxes’) [8, 9, 10].
Each possible combination of Nbin non-overlapping tiles
that geometrically covers the entire corresponding time-
frequency plane can serve as a complete basis spanning
the recorded sequence.
The WPD is computed by iterating a set of lowpass and
highpass ﬁlters (H and G respectively). The functions
underlying the expansions of H and G are ”wavelets”
(”mother”) and ”scaling” (”father”) functions [11]. At
each iteration, the wavelet packet coeﬃcients are com-
puted by convoluting the signal with the ﬁlters. Here
we utilize the WPD using the ’Coiﬂet’ of order 1
as a ”mother” wavelet (smallest time support of all
’Coiﬂets’)[12, 13, 14, 15].
Using the Best Basis algorithm. The WPD gener-
ates an over-complete representation of the signal. The
challenge is to select, out of all possible representations,
the one that is the most eﬃcient in extracting the fea-
tures of interest. The Best Basis algorithm is a method
for selecting a basis that spans the signal with a small
number of signiﬁcant packets [8, 10]. For that, each
wavelet packet function is assigned an information cost
value Mq(q) = −q · log2(q) where q is the normalized en-
ergy of the wavelet packet. The total information cost of
a frequency subband is obtained by summing over all the

Mq(qk).

Viewing the frequency subbands as nodes in a binary
tree, the selection of the best basis is similar to a binary
tree search. Starting from the lowest level bands, we se-
lect for each pair of subbands either the two subbands
or their joint ”parent” band, whichever has the lower
information cost. The process is repeated at subsequent
levels, going up the scales, back to the global root. Doing
so, we select the set of subbands with the lowest possible
information cost (Fig. 2).
Bases Similarity Measure. Every wavelet packets ba-
sis can be described by the frequency subbands partition-
ing and the corresponding information cost of every one
of the subbands. We suggest using the following simi-
larity measure, annotated SM , for comparison between
decomposition bases - basis1 and basis2:

SM = Pn1=n2(Mn1 + Mn2)
Pn1 Mn1 + Pn2 Mn2

,

(2)

where Mn1 and Mn2 are the information cost of subbands
n1 and n2 for basis1 and basis2, respectively. The sum-
mation in the nominator is over all the common subbands
of the two bases. The idea is to compare the information
cost included in the similar subbands to the total in-
formation cost. Note, that the measure assumes values
between 0 (if the bases are totally dissimilar) and 1 (if
they are exactly the same).
The Ensemble Best Basis of multi-electrodes
recordings. In Figs. 3a and 3b we show an example of
the evaluated Best Bases for the recordings from two dif-
ferent electrodes at consecutive time windows (∼ 10 sec-
onds). As can be seen in these ﬁgures, the Best Bases dif-
fer from electrode to electrode (SM = 0.46±0.20 between
these electrodes) and also vary between consecutive time
windows for the same electrode (SM = 0.58 ± 0.12 [Fig.
3a] and SM = 0.63 ± 0.25 [Fig. 3b]). Looking for invari-
ant Best Bases, we proceed to evaluate an ensemble Best
Basis for all the electrodes. Following previously devised
methods [16, 17, 18, 19], we average over the informa-
tion cost binary tree of each of the L recorded signals in
the ensemble. This is done by ﬁrst calculating the in-
formation cost of all the nodes in the binary WPD tree
for each of the signals. Next, we evaluate the mean in-
formation cost of every node for the L signals by simple
averaging. Then we apply the Best Basis algorithm to
the mean values tree. Thus, we obtain a basis that may
not be optimal for each signal, but rather underlines the
mean content of the ensemble. The nonergodic nature of
the brain activity is reﬂected in the fact that the result-
ing ensemble best basis (EBB) varies between successive
short time windows (SM = 0.65 ± 0.33). Similarly, if we
start with temporal coarse-graining of the Best Bases for

FIG. 3: Person-speciﬁc frequency bands. The frequency sub-
bands division of the best basis of a single ECoG electrode signal
can change over time, as can be seen in (a) and (b), when calcu-
lated at 10 consecutive time windows of 9 seconds each (we used
only 5 levels of decomposition, to avoid a large inﬂuence due to a
negligent number of coeﬃcients, when using short time windows).
Comparing (a) to (b), it is evident that the frequency subbands
division is also distinct for the diﬀerent spatial locations. Even the
ensemble best basis of all the 96 ensemble electrodes, as shown in
(c), does not yield time-invariant partitioning into frequency sub-
bands. However, temporal coarse-graining of the ensemble best
basis by averaging over time windows of approximately 2.5 min-
utes produces robust frequency bands that are time-invariant for
long periods(over 10 minutes). This robustness is presented in (d)
by examples from the same recordings of such time-invariant parti-
tioning into frequency bands (before the seizure) [21]. Nonetheless,
the large diversity between individuals, which can be observed in
the 5 examples in (e), leads us to regard them as person-speciﬁc
frequency bands partitioning or spectral signatures.

the individual electrodes, the resulting Best Bases are
diﬀerent from each other and from the Ensemble Best
Bases. This is a reﬂection of the inherent nonergodicity
of the brain activity.
Time-Invariant Best Bases. However, we did discover
the existence of an underlying time-invariant (SM ≃ 1)
Best Basis in the nonergodic activity. This basis is dis-

FIG. 4: The frequency templates - before, during and after
epileptic seizure. (a) The stability of the frequency template of
the ECoG recording is demonstrated for time intervals of approx-
imately 2.5 minutes each, 10 minutes before the seizure onset and
30 seconds before the seizure onset. During the seizure, the en-
ergy distribution of the signals changes dramatically [23]. After
the seizure, the energy distribution changes again, as the energy
in the high frequencies decreases. (b) Preliminary analysis of scalp
EEG signals from the same recording of (a) shows the same fre-
quency template (inter-ictal and post-ictal) and the same temporal
changes in the energy distribution.

covered by combining ensemble averaging and temporal
coarse-graining over a new essential time scale. Namely,
by temporal coarse-graining of the short time EBBs over
a time window wider than an essential time scale (about
2.5 minutes) [20]. The latter satisﬁes the requirement
that the SM between EBBs at diﬀerent time segments is
larger than 0.95.
As shown in Fig. 3d, the resulting Best Basis is time-
invariant for recorded periods that are much longer than
the essential time scale [21]. Hence, the time-invariant
bases can be used as a frequency decomposition tem-
plate for analyzing the recorded brain activity at diﬀer-
ent times and locations [22].
Person-Speciﬁc Frequency Bands. Applying the
new spatio-temporal averaging of the Best Bases to the
recordings from diﬀerent persons (we analyzed recordings
from 12 persons), we found that each has its own speciﬁc
time-invariant Best Basis with its own characteristic fea-
tures, as illustrated in Fig. 3e. We emphasize that each
of the personal bases bears resemblance to the classical
EEG frequency bands, yet has its own speciﬁc signiﬁcant
deviations from it. Reﬂecting this notion, we note that
the inter-patient similarity is SM = 0.75 ± 0.16 for these
examples, which is higher than the similarity between the
variations of an EBB of a single patient over short time
windows. However, this inter-patient similarity is signif-
icantly lower than SM ≃ 1, which is measured for bases
of diﬀerent time windows of recordings of a single patient
above an essential time scale, and could not be consid-
ered as invariant. We propose that the frequency bands
are personal speciﬁc spectral signatures that can be used
in patient-speciﬁc diagnosis of recorded brain activity.
Self-Consistency Test. To further substantiate this
idea (and that the calculated frequency bands are not an

artifact), we show a comparison of the frequency bands
calculated in parallel, for the same person, both from
ECoG and scalp EEG recordings. As illustrated in Fig.
4, between seizure episodes (inter-ictal) the calculated
frequency bands are almost identical (SM ≃ 1). We also
show that the frequency partitioning changes during the
seizure (ictal) episodes. Hence, we expect that a decom-
position of the ictal activity according to the inter-ictal
bands can help in seizure diagnosis.
Conclusions. These results illustrate the potential
value of the personal best-basis to serve as a template
for quantitative analysis of the epileptic activity [24]. For
example, the ictal activity can be decomposed according
to the inter-ictal bands during the chronic monitoring of
the brain activity. Our new analysis approach can help,
for example, in the identiﬁcation of the epileptic foci. It
can also be used to develop quantitative person-speciﬁc
analysis for early warning of epileptic seizures [25, 26].
Beyond recorded brain activity, we expect the new ap-
proach to be helpful in revealing the existence of essential
time scales and time-invariant frequency decomposition
templates in a wide class of other nonergodic biological
systems with multi-time scale dynamics. As in the case
of the brain, we expect that revealing such hidden tem-
plates can help in analyzing variations in the systems
function and performance.

[1] The occurrence of epilepsy is estimated to aﬀect about
1% of the world population [2]. With the aid of anti-
epileptic drugs, approximately 70% of all epileptic pa-
tients can be kept seizure-free. But for the remaining
30%, the best possible treatment is surgical resection of
the focus [3]. A challenging task facing epileptologists is
the precise identiﬁcation of the focus regions that should
be removed [4]. When the localization of the region re-
mains uncertain after conventional, noninvasive measure-
ments such as EEG and MEG, better localization is ob-
tained using invasive electrocorticogram (ECoG).

[15] In the ﬁrst iteration, the time-frequency plane is divided
into two halves: the low frequencies subband and the
high frequencies subband. At each iteration the subbands
from the previous iteration are divided again into a low
frequencies half and a high frequencies half. This pro-
cedure is repeated until the highest frequency resolution
(∆fmin = 1/Nbin) is reached. Each iteration of the ﬁlters
correspond to a division of a ”parent” tree node into two

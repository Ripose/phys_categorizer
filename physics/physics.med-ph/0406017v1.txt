1. Introduction

The ﬁeld of biomedical signal processing has given rise to a number of techniques for
assisting physicians with their everyday tasks of diagnosing and monitoring medical
disorders. Analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a quantitative description
of the heart’s electrical activity and is routinely used in hospitals as a tool for identifying
cardiac disorders.

A large variety of signal processing techniques have been employed for ﬁltering the
raw ECG signal prior to feature extraction and diagnosis of medical disorders. A typical
ECG is invariably corrupted by (i) electrical interference from surrounding equipment
(e.g. eﬀect of the electrical mains supply), (ii) measurement (or electrode contact) noise,
(iii) electromyographic (muscle contraction), (iv) movement artefacts, (v) baseline drift
and respiratory artefacts and (vi) instrumentation noise (such as artefacts from the
analogue to digital conversion process) (Friesen et al. 1990).

Many techniques may be employed for ﬁltering and removing noise from the raw
ECG signal, such as wavelet decomposition (Nikolaev et al. 2000), Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) (Paul et al. 2000), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (Potter
et al. 2002), nonlinear noise reduction (Schreiber & Kaplan 1996) and traditional
Wiener methods. The ECG forms the basis of a wide range of medical studies,
including the investigation of heart rate variability, respiration and QT dispersion (Malik
& Camm 1995). The utility of these medical indicators relies on signal processing
techniques for detecting R-peaks (Pan & Tompkins 1985), deriving heart rate and
respiratory rate (Moody et al. 1985), and measuring QT-intervals (Davey 1999).

Despite the numerous techniques that may be found in the literature and those
it remains
that are now freely available on the Internet (Goldberger et al. 2000),
extremely diﬃcult to evaluate and contrast their performance. The recent proliferation
of biomedical databases, such as Physiobank (Goldberger et al. 2000), provides a
common setting for comparing techniques and approaches. While this availability of
real biomedical recordings has and will continue to advance the pace of research, the
lack of internationally agreed upon benchmarks means that it is impossible to compare
competing signal processing techniques. The deﬁnition of such benchmarks is hindered
by the fact that the true underlying dynamics of a real ECG can never be known. This
void in the ﬁeld of biomedical research calls for a gold standard, where an ECG with
well-understood dynamics and known characteristics is made freely available.

The model presented here, known as ECGSYN (synthetic electrocardiogram), is
motivated by the need to evaluate and quantify the performance of the above signal
processing techniques on ECG signals with known characteristics. While the Physionet
web-site (Goldberger et al. 2000) already contains a synthetic ECG generator (Ruha &
Nissila 1997), this is not intended to be highly realistic. The model and its underlying
algorithm described in detail in this paper is capable of producing extremely realistic
ECG signals with complete ﬂexibility over the choice of parameters that govern the

of ECGSYN, software has been made freely available as both Matlab and C code
.
‡
Furthermore, users can employ ECGSYN over the Internet using a Java applet, which
provides a means of downloading an ECG signal with characteristics selected from a
graphical user interface.

2. Background

The average heart rate is calculated by ﬁrst measuring the time interval, denoted RR
interval, between two consecutive R peaks (Fig. 1), taking the average reciprocal of
this value over a ﬁxed window (usually 15, 30 or 60 seconds) and then scaling to units
of beats per minute (bpm). A time series of RR intervals is often referred to as an
RR tachogram and the variation in this time series is governed by the balance between
the sympathetic (ﬁght and ﬂight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) branches of the
central nervous system, known as the sympathovagal balance. In general, innervation of
the fast acting parasympathetic branch decreases heart rate, whereas the (more slowly
acting) sympathetic branch increases heart rate. This RR tachogram can therefore
be used to estimate the eﬀect of both these branches. A spectral analysis of the RR
tachogram is usually divided into main frequency bands, known as the low-frequency
(LF) band (0.04 to 0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF) band (0.15 to 0.4 Hz) (Task
Force of the European Society of Cardiology et al. 1996). Sympathetic tone is believed
to aﬀect the LF component whereas both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity
inﬂuence the HF component (Malik & Camm 1995). The ratio of the power contained
in the LF and HF components has been used as a measure of the sympathovagal balance
(Malik & Camm 1995, Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology et al. 1996).
The structure of the power spectrum of the RR tachogram tends to vary from
person to person with a number of spectral peaks associated with particular biological
mechanisms (McSharry et al. 2002, Stefanovska et al. 2001). While the correspondence
between these mechanisms and the positions of spectral peaks are strongly debated,
there are two peaks which usually appear in most subjects. These are due to Respiratory
Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) (Hales 1733, Ludwig 1847) caused by parasympathetic activity
which is synchronous with the respiratory cycle and Mayer waves caused by oscillations
in the blood pressure waves (De Boer et al. 1987). RSA usually gives rise to a peak
in the HF region around 0.25 Hz, corresponding to 15 breaths per minute, whereas the
Mayer waves cause a peak around 0.1 Hz.

3. Method

The dynamical model, ECGSYN, employed for generating the synthetic ECG is
composed of two parts. Firstly, an internal time series with internal sampling frequency
fint is produced to incorporate a speciﬁc mean heart rate, standard deviation and

morphology of the ECG is produced by specifying the locations and heights of the
peaks that occur during each heart beat. A ﬂow chart of the processes in ECGSYN for
producing the ECG is shown in Fig. 2.

The spectral characteristics of the RR tachogram, including both RSA and Mayer
waves, are replicated by specifying a bi-modal spectrum composed of the sum of two

Fourier transform of a sequence of complex numbers with amplitudes
which are randomly distributed between 0 and 2π. By multiplying this time series by
an appropriate scaling constant and adding an oﬀset value, the resulting time series
can be given any required mean and standard deviation. Diﬀerent realisations of the
random phases may be speciﬁed by varying the seed of the random number generator.
In this way, many diﬀerent time series T (t) may be generated with the same temporal
and spectral properties.

morphology of each cycle labeled by its peaks and troughs, P, Q, R, S and T, as shown
in Fig. 1. This quasi-periodicity can be reproduced by constructing a dynamical model
containing an attracting limit cycle; each heart beat corresponds to one revolution
around this limit cycle, which lies in the (x, y)-plane as shown in Fig. 3. The morphology
of the ECG is created by using a series of exponentials to force the trajectory to trace
out the PQRST-waveform in the z-direction. A series of ﬁve angles, (θP , θQ, θR, θS,
θT ), are used to specify the extrema of the peaks (P,Q,R,S,T) respectively.

respiratory frequency f2 in (1) using z0(t) = A sin(2πf2t). The output synthetic ECG
signal, s(t), is the vertical component of the three-dimensional dynamical system in (2):
s(t) = z(t).

extrema P,Q,R,S and T.

Having calculated the internal RR tachogram expressed by the time series T (t)
with power spectrum S(f ) given by (1), this can then be used to drive the dynamical
model (2) so that the resulting RR intervals will have the same power spectrum as
time tn, with angle θ = θR, the time
that given by S(f ). Starting from the auxiliary
§
interval T (tn) is used to calculate an angular frequency Ωn = 2π
T (tn) . This particular
angular frequency, Ωn, is used to specify the dynamics until the angle θ reaches θR
again, whereby a complete revolution (one heart beat) has taken place. For the next
revolution, the time is updated, tn+1 = tn + T (tn), and the next angular frequency,
Ωn+1 = 2π
T (tn+1) , is used to drive the trajectory around the limit cycle. In this way, the
internally generated beat-to-beat time series, T (t), can be used to generate an ECG
with associated RR intervals that have the same spectral characteristics. The angular
frequency ω(t) in (2) is speciﬁed using the beat-to-beat values Ωn obtained from the
internally generated RR tachogram:

ω(t) = Ωn,

t < tn+1.

Given these beat-to-beat values of the angular frequency ω, the equations of motion
in (2) are integrated using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (Press et al. 1992). The
time series T (t) used for deﬁning the values of Ωn has a high sampling frequency of
fint, which is eﬀectively the step size of the integration. The ﬁnal output ECG signal
is then down-sampled to fecg if fint > fecg by a factor fint
to generate an ECG at the
fecg
requested sampling frequency. For simplicity, fint is taken as an integer multiple of fecg
and anti-aliasing ﬁltering is therefore not required if fecg is chosen to be suﬃciently high.

This auxiliary time axis is used to calculate the values of Ωn for consecutive RR intervals whereas

The size of the mean heart rate aﬀects the shape of the ECG morphology. An
analysis of real ECG signals for diﬀerent heart rates shows that the intervals between
the extrema vary by diﬀerent amounts; in particular the QRS width decreases with
increasing heart rate. This is as one would expect; when sympathetic tone increases the
conduction velocity across the ventricles increases, together with an augmented heart
rate. The time for ventricular depolarisation (represented by the QRS complex of the
ECG) is therefore shorter. These changes are replicated by modifying the width of the
exponentials in (2) and also the positions of the angles θ. This is achieved by using a
hmean/60 where hmean is the mean heart rate expressed
heart rate dependent factor α =
in units of bpm (see Table 1).

4. Results

The synthetic ECG provides a realistic signal for a range of heart rates. Figure 4
illustrates examples of the synthetic ECG for three diﬀerent heart rates; 30 bpm, 60 bpm,
and 120 bpm. Notice that the PR, QT and QRS widths all shorten with increasing heart
rate. It is important to note that the nonlinear relationship between the morphology
modulation factor α and mean heart rate hmean limits the contraction of the overall
PQRST morphology relative to the refractory period (the minimum amount of time in
which depolarisation and repolarisation of the cardiac muscle can occur).

The ability of ECGSYN to generate ECG signals with known spectral
characteristics provides a means of testing the eﬀect of varying the ECG sampling
frequency fecg on the estimation of heart rate variability (HRV) metrics. Figure 5
illustrates the increase in estimation accuracy of a HRV metric, the LF/HF ratio, with
increasing fecg. The error bars represent one standard deviation on either side of the
means (dots) of each 1000 Montecarlo runs. The true input LF/HF ratio was 0.5 as
shown by the horizontal line. The synthetic ECG signals had a mean heart rate of
60 bpm and a standard deviation of 3 bpm. The method used for estimating the
LF/HF ratio, the Lomb periodogram, introduces negligible variance into the estimate
(Cliﬀord 1998), and therefore the downward bias of the estimates can be considered
due to fecg being too low. Note that below 512 Hz, the LF/HF ratio is considerably
underestimated. This is consistent with studies performed on real data (Abboud &
Barnea 1995).

input into the algorithm. Open-source software for the algorithm underlying ECGSYN
is freely available in both Matlab and C. A Java applet facilitates the generation of ECG
signals over the Internet with characteristics selected using a graphical user interface.

By examining the statistical properties of artiﬁcially generated ECG signals, it has
been shown that estimates of HRV using the LF/HF ratio depend on the sampling
frequency, fecg, of the ECG. Small values of fecg gives rise to ECG signals which lead
to underestimated LF/HF ratios. This provides a basis for the low sample frequency
problem in HRV studies (Abboud & Barnea 1995). In addition, these results provide
a guide for physicians when selecting the sampling frequency of the ECG based on the
required accuracy of the HRV metrics.

The availability of ECGSYN through open-source software and the ability to
generate collections of ECG signals with carefully controlled and a priori known
characteristics will allow biomedical researchers to test and provide operation statistics
for new signal processing techniques. This will enable physicians to compare and
evaluate diﬀerent techniques and to select those that best suit their requirements.

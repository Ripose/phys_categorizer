To analyze the crucial role of the ﬂuctuation and relaxational eﬀects in the human brain func-
tioning we have studied a some statistical quantiﬁers that support the informational characteristics
of neuromagnetic responses of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. The signals to a ﬂickering
stimulus of diﬀerent color combinations has been obtained from a group of control subjects which is
contrasted with those for a patient with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE). We have revealed that the
existence of the speciﬁc stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds and the concomitant relaxation singulari-
ties of the corresponding nonequilibrium processes of chaotic behavior of the signals in the separate
areas for a patient most likely shows the pronounced zones responsible the appearance of PSE.

Introduction. Manifold time series are emerged in the
diverse ﬁelds of natural sciences, technology, physiology,
medicine and economics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . A majority
of natural systems can be considered dynamical systems,
whose evolution can be studied looking at time series as-
sociated to signiﬁcant variables on a suitable scale. These
series are often characterized by a strong time and spatial
synchronization or coherence, chaotic and robust behav-
ior.

When analyzing time series data with linear methods,
there are certain standard procedures one can follow,
moreover the behaviour may be completely described by
a relatively small set of parameters. For nonlinear time
series analysis, this is not the case. While black box al-
gorithms exist for the analysis of time series data with
nonlinear methods, the application of these algorithms
requires considerable knowledge and skill on the part of
the operator.

In a nonlinear time series analysis one begins from a
reconstruction of the state spaces from observed data
[8, 9, 10, 11]. Although the embedding theorems [12]
provide an important means of understanding the recon-
struction procedure, none of them is formally applicable
in practice. The reason is that they all deal with inﬁ-
nite, noise free trajectories of a dynamical system. It is
not obvious that the theorems should be ”approximately
valid ” if the requirements are ”approximately fulﬁlled”
, for example, if the data sequence is long but ﬁnite and
reasonably clean but not noise free.

One of the ways for the study of the manifestation of
physical properties of random processes (and the Markov
random processes (MRP) in particular) in time series
originates from the nonequilibrium statistical physics.

The history of the fundamental role of stochastic pro-
cesses in physics back a century to the Markov repre-
sentations [13] of random telegraphic signals and yet
such noise still ﬁnds application in models of contem-
porary complex phenomena. A few posterior examples
of complex physical phenomena modelled by the Markov
stochastic processes are: kinetic and relaxation processes
in gases [14] and plasma [15], condensed matter physics
(liquids [16], solids [17], and superconductivity [18]), as-
trophysics [19], nuclear physics [20], quantum [21] and
classical [22] physics, to name only a few. At present, we
can make use of a variety of statistical methods for the
analysis of the Markov and non-Markov statistical eﬀects
in diverse physical systems. Typical such schemes are the
Zwanzig-Mori’s kinetic equations [23], generalized master
equations and corresponding statistical quantiﬁers [24],
the Lee’s recurrence relation method [25], the general-
ized Langevin equation (GLE) [26], etc.

In this paper we shall study the crucial role of re-
laxation and kinetic singularities in the functioning of
healthy physiological and pathological systems for the
case of photosensitive epilepsy (PSE). Particularly, it can
imply that the presence of large space and times scales
distinctions in the stochastic dynamics of discrete time
series can characterize the pathological (or catastroph-
ical) violation of salutary dynamic states of the human
brain. As an example, here we will show that the appear-
ance of strong distinction in the relaxational time scales
and extraordinary stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds in
the stochastic evolution of neuromagnetic responses of
human brain as recorded by MEG is most likely shows
the pronounced zones responsible the appearance of PSE.
Information measures for phase stratiﬁcation and re-
laxational processes in complex systems, measures for
nonlinear dynamics in the phase space. First let’s con-
sider simpliﬁed version of the Markov processes. Let
us introduce the conditional probability K1(x1, t1|x2, t2)

times

t1, t2, ....tn−1 depends only on xn−1

that x is found in the range (x2, x2 + dx2) at x2, if x had
the value x1 at t1. For the Markov random process the
conditional probability that x lies in the range (xn, xn +
dxn) at tn given that x had the values x1, x2, ...xn−1
at
is
as follows: Kn−1(x1, t1; x2, t2; ...xn−1, tn−1|xn, tn) =
K1(xn−1, tn−1|xn, tn). The last equation states that,
given the state of the Markov process at some times
tn−1 < tn, the forthcoming (future) state of the process
at tn is independent of all previous states at prior times.
The equation is a standard deﬁnition of the Markov ran-
dom process. So, from the physical point of view the
Markov process is the process without aftereﬀect.
It
means that the ”future ” and the ”past” of a process
not depend each from other at known ”present”.

Phase space play the crucial role in the determination
of the singularities of nonlinear dynamics of an under-
lying system. For the correct construction of the phase
space and analysis of studied dynamics a set of the dy-
namical orthogonal statistical variables which describes
of the dynamical state of the complex system is one of
the important characteristics. Let consider a dynamical
vector of state Am
N = (xj+1, xj+2, xj+3, ....xj+m), where
m, j = N/2, N/2 + 1, N/2 + 2, ...N and N is a sample’s
length. From the discrete equation of motion

However, a similar form of dynamic variables is incon-
venient. That is why we prefer the use the orthogonal
variables as vectors Wn given below. Using the Gram-
Schmidt orthogonalization procedure [27] for the set of
variables Bn(0) one can obtain the new set of dynamical

orthogonal variables, i.e., vectors where the mean should
be read in terms of scalar products and δn,m is the Kro-
necker’s symbol. Now we may easily introduce the recur-
rence formula in which the senior values Wn = Wn(t) are
connected with the junior values

W0 = A0

k(0), W1 = {i ˆL − λ1}W0, . . .

hWnWmi = δn,mh|Wn|

i,

Wn = {i ˆL − λn}Wn−1 + Λn−1Wn−2 + ..., n > 1. (4)

Here we has used the relaxation and kinetic parameters,
which are described also by the Liouville’s quasioperator
L as follows

λn =

Λn =

where Λn = Ω2
n−1, a parameter Ωn is the general relax-
ation frequencies. A set of frequencies λn describes an
eigenspectrum of the Liouville’s operator

Then we will introduce the information measures of the
ﬁrst and second orders on the basis of amplitude scale and
relaxation parameters.

Experimental data for PSE, used for calculations.
Next, we can proceed directly to the analysis of the ex-
perimental data: MEG signals recorded from a group
of nine healthy human subjects and in a patient with
(PSE) [31]. PSE is a common type of stimulus-induced
epilepsy, deﬁned as recurrent convulsions precipitated by
visual stimuli, particularly a ﬂickering light. The diagno-
sis of PSE involves ﬁnding paroxysmal spikes on an EEG
in response to the intermittent light stimulation. To elu-
cidate the color-dependency of PS in normal subjects,
brain activities subjected to uniform chromatic ﬂickers
with whole-scalp MEG has been measured in Ref.
[31]
(further details of the MEG experiment one can ﬁnd in
[31]).

The subjects and the data set were part of an earlier
study [31]; however, we mentioned the relevant details
for the sake of completeness. Nine-right-handled healthy
adults (two females, seven males; age range 22-27years)
voluntarily participated. Two additional age-matched
child control subjects, and one more photosensitive pa-
tient (age 14yr) under medication (sodium valporate),
were also studied. All subjects were right-handed and
were explicitly informed that ﬂicker stimulation might
lead to epileptic seizures. They gave their written in-
formed consent before recording. The subjects were in-
structed to passively observe visual stimuli with minimal

eye movement. During the testing session for the pho-
tosensitive patients, pediatric neurologists were present
for monitoring their health condition as a precautionary

measure.

Subjects were screened for photosensitivity and per-
sonal or family history of epilepsy. The experimental
procedures followed the Declaration of Helsinki and were
approved by the National Children’s Hospital in Japan.
All subjects gave their informed consent after the aim and
potential risk of the experiment were explained. Dur-
ing the recording, the subjects sat in the magnetically
shielded room and were instructed to observe visual stim-
uli passively without moving their eyes.

Stimuli were generated by the two video projectors
and delivered to the viewing window in the shield room
through an optical ﬁber bundle. Each projector contin-
uously produced a single color stimulus. Liquid crystal
shutters were located between the optical device and the
projectors. By alternative opening one of the shutters
for 50 ms, 10 Hz (square-wave) chromatic ﬂicker was pro-
duced on the viewing distance of 30 cm. Three color com-
bination were used : red-green (R/G), blue-green (B/G),
and red-blue (R/B). CIE coordinates were x=0. 496,
y=0. 396 for red; x=0. 308, y=0. 522 for green; and
x=0. 153, y= 0. 122 for blue. All color stimuli had a
luminance of 1.6 cd/m2 in otherwise total darkness. In
a single trial, the stimulus was presented for 2s and fol-
lowed by an inter-trial interval of 3s, during which no
visual stimulus was displayed. In a single session, color
combination was ﬁxed.

Neuromagnetic responses were measured with a 122-
channel whole-scalp neoromagnetometer (Neuromag -
122; Neuromag Ltd. Finland). The neoromag-122 has 61
sensor locations, each containing two originally oriented
planner gradiometers coupled to dc-SCUID (supercon-
ducting quantum interference device) sensors. The two
sensors of each location measure two orthogonal tangen-
tial derivatives of the brain magnetic ﬁeld component
perpendicular to the surface of the sensor array. The
planner gradiometers measure the strongest magnetic sig-
nals directly above local cortical currents. From 200
ms prior responses were analog-ﬁltered (bandpass fre-
quency 0.03 - 100 Hz) and digitized at 0.5 kHz. Eye
movements and blinks were monitored by measuring an
electro-oculogram.

Trials with MEG amplitudes > 3000 fT/cm and/or
electro-oculogram amplitudes > 150µ V were automati-
cally rejected from averaging. Trials were repeated until
> 80 responses were averaged for each color-combination.
The averaged MEG signals were digitally lowpass-ﬁltered
at 40 Hz, and then the DC oﬀset during the baseline
(−100 to 0 ms) was removed. At each sensor location,
the magnetic waveform amplitude was calculated as the
vector sum of the orthogonal components. Peak ampli-
tude were normalized within each subject with respect
to the subject’s maximum amplitude. The latency range
from −100 to −1100 ms was divided with 100 ms bins.
Then, the peak amplitudes were calculated by averaging
all peak amplitudes within each bin.

Results of our consideration, based on the equations
of the presented here theory, are depicted in Figs. 1- 12.
Our results for nine healthy subjects and for the patient
with PSE in comparison has been submitted in Figs. 13
- 20 . Among they here are: the time trace of the MEG’s
signals (W0) and for the three junior dynamical orthogo-
nal variables (Wi), i = 1, 2 and 3; 2) the phase space cre-
ated by the points with coordinates (Wi), i = 0, 1, 2 and
3; 3) the phase space, ﬁlled by the trajectories (Wi(t)),
i = 0, 1, 2 and 3; 4) the time dependence of ﬁrst four
dynamic functions: the initial time correlation functions
(TCF) M0(t) and the ﬁrst three junior memory functions
Mi(t), i = 1, 2 and 3. The results of the experiment for
the red-blue (R/B) and red-green (R/G) combination of
color signals are used in the all of the ﬁgures.

As an example the similar results for the healthy sub-
ject No. 4, sensor No. 10 has been submitted in Figs. (1)
- (4). Next the analogical results for patient with PSE
for sensor No. 10 has been presented in Figs. (5)- (8).
With the one side the obtained results possesses by the
clearly visible opposite character. As it is visible from
the comparison the dynamic character of the behavior of
the variables (Wi(t)) (i = 1, 2 and 3) appears as a diﬀer-
ent one. The time dependence of the variables (W1(t))

( see, Fig. 1) presents the time behavior of the orthog-

Next dynamic variable (W2(t)) describe the orthogonal
acceleration, and variable (W3(t)) depicts the longitudi-
nal orthogonal energy current etc. Signals (Wi(t)) for the
patient with PSE can be characterized by regular noise.
The phase clouds formed by the manifold of the phase
points (see, Figs. 2 and 6) has the drastic distinctions
for the healthy (see, Fig. 2) in comparison to patient
with PSE (see, Fig. 6).

The stratiﬁcation of the phase clouds and the existence
of the stable pseudoorbits is more visible at the ﬁrst case.
For patient with PSE Fig. (6) the phase stratiﬁcation dis-
appears. The phase clouds itself can be characterized by
the symmetrical nuclei, they have spatial homogeneity.
The phase trajectories for the healthy ( see, Fig. 3) are
the broken lines.

For the patient with PSE (see, Fig. 7) the pictures of
the phase trajectories contrast sharply with the preceding
case. The phase trajectories are packed compactly in the
restricted areas of the phase space. The violent diﬀerence

Thus, for the signals for the patient with PSE with sen-
sor number 10 the diﬀerence against the healthy subjects
consist in the drastic changes of the ﬂuctuation scales of
the dynamic orthogonal variables and the space sizes of
the phase clouds. The similar diﬀerence of the scales
constitutes the values from 10 till 80 times and it can to
note the speciﬁc role and behavior of the sensor’s number
n=10 in the formation of PSE mechanisms ! The diﬀer-
ences in the scales the orthogonal dynamic variables and
in the sizes of the phase clouds for sensors with sensor’s
numbers n= 10, 46, 51, 53, and 59 has been presented in
detailed Table I .

Figure 8: The time dependence of the ﬁrst four memory func-
tions for the patient with PSE for R/B combination of the
light stimulus :a) initial TCF (M0(t)); b) the ﬁrst order mem-
ory function (M1(t)); c) the second order memory function
(M2(t)); d) the third order memory function (M3(t)) .

The time dependence of the initial time correlation
function (TCF) M0(t) and the ﬁrst three memory func-
tion of the junior order Mi(t), i = 1, 2 and 3 is presented
in Figs. 4 (for healthy persons) and 8 (for the patient
with PSE). Besides of one can see sharp diﬀering behav-
ior of the time functions for healthy and for patient. One
can observe large-scale time correlation for healthy in the
time dependence of Mi(t), i = 0, 1, 2 and 3, whereas in
a case of patient with PSE the similar functions demon-
strate small-scale ﬂuctuation and small-amplitude oscil-
lation .

One can note that the sensor’s number n = 10, 46,
51, 53 and 59 is a speciﬁc point in the patient with PSE
brain core. It is interesting to observe a dynamical pic-
ture for the usual and nonspeciﬁc points at the human
cerebral cortex. To this aim the results for nonspeciﬁc
point on the human brain core with sensor’s number n
= 13 are submitted in Figs. (9) - (16). Figs. (9) (for
healthy) and (13) (for the patient with PSE) present the
time dependence of the ﬁrst four dynamical orthogonal
variables. One can see more stepless behavior of the vari-
ables for Wi(t) for healthy and more sharp and irregular
dynamics of Wi(t) for the patient with PSE. Figs. (10)
(for healthy) and (14) (for the patient with PSE) show
the construction of the phase space by the separate phase
points. We see stratiﬁed phase space for healthy versus
patient with PSE. Figs. (11) (for healthy) and (15) (for
the patient with PSE) show the nonlinear dynamics of

the formation of the phase space by the phase trajecto-
ries.

Here one can observe pseudoperiodic orbital movement
for the phase trajectory for healthy and quasistrange at-
tractors for the patient with PSE. It is necessary to note
small time scales in the dynamics for healthy and larger
time scales in nonlinear dynamics for the patient with
PSE. Figs. (12) (for healthy) and (16) and (for the pa-
tient with PSE) depict the time dependence of the initial
TCF and the ﬁrst three memory functions Mi(t), i= 1,2
and 3. The large scale ﬂuctuation and oscillation are vis-
ible in the time dependence of Mi(t), i= 0, 1, 2 and 3 for
healthy and small scale deformation are evident for the
patient with the PSE.

Figs. 17 and 18 show the topographic dependence of
the ﬁrst relaxation parameters λ1 for red-blue (R/B)(Fig.
17) and red-green (R/G) (Fig.18) combinations of the
light stimulus for the healthy subjects in comparison with
the patient with PSE. One can note the dramatic diﬀer-
ence of the numerical values of this parameter for healthy
and patient with PSE. The parameter λ1 diﬀers for the all
sensors an average for 6-7 times approximately. But one
can note the special strong diﬀerence between healthy
and patient in numerical values of parameter λ1 espe-
cially for the sensors with sensor’s numbers n= 10, 46,
51, 53 and 59.

Figs. 19 (for R/ B combination of the light stimu-
lus) and 20 (for R/ G combination) demonstrate the be-
haviour of relaxation parameter λ1 for the each individual
from nine healthy subjects averaged on the all sensor’s
location in cerebral cortex in comparison with the pa-

tient with PSE. One can notice a remarkable diﬀerence
of λ1 for patient against healthy subjects (approximately
4 - 8 times, on average 7 times for R/ B combination
and 4, 5 times for R/G combination of the light signals).
This diﬀerence is a reliable indicator to the serious de-
struction in functioning of the human organism at PSE.
It is important note that behavior of coeﬃcients of λ1
speciﬁes the singularities of the relaxation mechanisms
in the MEG’s signals. This fact indicates the critical role
of the singular relaxation processes in the pathological
functioning of the human cerebral cortex for the patient
with PSE.

Once more one can note that sensor’s number n= 10,
46, 51, 53 and 59 is a speciﬁc point in the patient’s brain
with PSE . It is interesting to see a dynamical picture
for the usual and nonspeciﬁc points at the human brain
core. Just to this end the results for indistinctive sensor’s
number n = 13 are shown in Figs. 9 - 16.

Conclusion. From the all aforementioned one can note
that physiological models often have large numbers of pa-
rameters, each with their natural range of variability and
uncertainty in measurement. Relaxation and dynamic
behavior of the system’s signals can vary wildly from one
set of parameters to another. Oﬀered analysis provides

Figure 15: The phase portraits produced by the phase tra-
jectories for patient with PSE, m = 13, R/ B combination of
the light stimulus.

Many natural phenomena are described by distribu-
tions with time scale-invariant behavior [33]. The sug-
gested approach allows the stochastic dynamics of neu-
romagnetic signals in human cortex to be treated in a
probabilistic manner and to search for its statistical sin-
gularities. From the physical point of view the obtained
results can be used as a test to identify the presence or
absence of brain anomalies as they occur in a patient
with PSE. The set of our quantiﬁers is uniquely associ-
ated with the emergence of scale and relaxation eﬀects in
the chaotic behavior of the human brain core. The reg-
istration of the behavior of those indicators as discussed
here is then of beneﬁcial use to detect the pathological
state of separate areas (sensors 10, 46, 51, 53 and 59) in
the human brain of a patient with PSE.

There exist also other quantiﬁers of a diﬀerent nature,
such as the Lyapunov’s exponent, Kolmogorov-Sinai en-
tropy, correlation dimension, etc., which are widely used
in nonlinear dynamics and related applications, see in
[34]. In the present context, we ﬁnd that the em-
Ref.
ployed statistical and dynamical measures are not only
convenient for analysis but also ideally suited to iden-
tify anomalous brain behavior. The search for yet other
quantiﬁers, and foremost, the optimization of such mea-
sures when applied to complex, discrete time dynamics
presents a true challenge. This objective particularly
holds true when attempts are made to identify and quan-
tify an anomalous functioning in living systems. The

PSE is a type of reﬂexive epilepsy which originates
mostly in visual cortex (both striate and extra-striate)
but with high possibility towards propagating to other

9

cortical regions [35]. Healthy brain may possibly possess
an inherent controlling (or defensive) mechanism against
this propagation of cortical excitations, breakdown of
which makes the brain vulnerable to trigger epileptic
seizures in patients [36]. However, the exact origin and
dynamical nature of this putative defensive mechanism
is not yet fully known. Earlier we showed [31] that brain
responses against chromatic ﬂickering in healthy subjects
represent strong nonlinear structures where as nonlinear-
ity is dramatically reduced to minimal in patients.

Here we report that patient’s brain show speciﬁc re-
laxation and dynamic eﬀects in comparison with healthy
brains. One might remark that some earlier steps to-
wards the understanding the normal and diseased human
brain have already been set in other ﬁelds of science such
as neurology, clinical neurophysiology,neuroscience and
so on. The numerous studies applying linear and non-
linear time series analysis to EEG and MEG in epilep-
tic patients are discussed in details in Refs.
[31], [32]
with taking into account the neurophysiological basis of
epilepsy, in particular photosensitive epilepsy. Speciﬁ-
cally, the results of [31] suggested that a signiﬁcant non-
linear structure was evident in the MEG’s signals for con-
trol subjects, whereas nonlinearity was not detected for
the patient.

A complex network composed of interacting nonlinear
system with memory component is inherently stable and
critically robust against external perturbations. Quick
inhibitory eﬀect, that is essential for the prevention of
PSE, is made possible by the faster signal processing be-
tween distant regions.

Further, such network is capable to facilitate ﬂexible
and spontaneous transitions between many possible con-
ﬁgurations as opposed to being entrained or locked with

10

the external perturbations [37]. In short, our ﬁndings are
in line with growing body of evidence that physiological
systems generate activity ﬂuctuations on many tempo-
ral and spatial scales and that pathological states are
associated with an impairment of this spatio-temporally
complex structure.

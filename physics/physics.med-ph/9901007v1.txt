Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the suitability of various heart
rate variability (HRV) measures for correctly classifying electrocardiogram records of varying lengths
as normal or revealing the presence of heart failure. Scale-dependent HRV measures were found to
be substantially superior to scale-independent measures (scaling exponents) for discriminating the
two classes of data over a broad range of record lengths. The wavelet-coeﬃcient standard deviation
at a scale near 32 heartbeat intervals, and its spectral counterpart near 1/32 cycles per interval,
provide reliable results using record lengths just minutes long. A jittered integrate-and-ﬁre model
built around a fractal Gaussian-noise kernel provides a realistic, though not perfect, simulation of
heartbeat sequences.

Though the notion of using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to assess the condition of the cardiovascular system
stretches back some 40 years, its use as a noninvasive clinical tool has only recently come to the fore [1]. A whole
host of measures, both scale-dependent and scale-independent, have been added to the HRV armamentarium over the
years.

One of the more venerable among the many scale-dependent measures in the literature is the interbeat-interval
(R-R) standard deviation σint [2]. The canonical example of a scale-independent measure is the scaling exponent αS
of the interbeat-interval power spectrum, associated with the decreasing power-law form of the spectrum at suﬃciently
low frequencies f : S(f ) ∝ f −αS [1,3]. Other scale-independent measures have been developed by us [4–6], and by
others [7–9]. One of the principal goals of this Letter is to establish the relative merits of these two classes of measures,
scale-dependent and scale-independent, for assessing cardiac dysfunction.

One factor that can confound the reliability of a measure is the nonstationarity of the R-R time series. Multiresolu-
tion wavelet analysis provides an ideal means of decomposing a signal into its components at diﬀerent scales [10–12],
and at the same time has the salutary eﬀect of eliminating nonstationarities [13,14]. It is therefore ideal for examining
both scale-dependent and scale-independent measures; it is in this latter capacity that it provides an estimate of the
wavelet scaling exponent αW [6].

We recently carried out a study [6] in which wavelets were used to analyze the R-R interval sequence from a standard
electrocardiogram (ECG) database [15]. Using the wavelet-coeﬃcient standard deviation σwav(m), where m = 2r is
the scale and r is the scale index, we discovered a critical scale window near m = 32 interbeat intervals over which it
was possible to perfectly discriminate heart-failure patients from normal subjects. The presence of this scale window
was conﬁrmed in an Israeli-Danish study of diabetic patients who had not yet developed clinical signs of cardiovascular
disease [16]. These two studies [6,16], in conjunction with our earlier investigations which revealed a similar critical
scale window in the counting statistics of the heartbeat [4,5,17] (as opposed to the time-interval statistics considered
here), lead to the recognition that scales in the vicinity of m = 32 enjoy a special status. This conclusion has been
borne out for a broad range of analyzing wavelets, from Daubechies 2-tap (Haar) to Daubechies 20-tap [10,18] (higher
order analyzing wavelets are suitable for removing polynomial nonstationarities [11]). It is clear that scale-dependent
measures [such as σwav(32)] substantially outperform scale-independent ones (such as αS and αW ) in their ability to
discriminate patients with certain cardiac dysfunctions from normal subjects (see also [18,19]).

The reduction in the value of the wavelet-coeﬃcient standard deviation σwav(32) that leads to the scale window
occurs not only for heart-failure patients [6], but also for heart-failure patients with atrial ﬁbrillation [18], diabetic
patients [16], heart-transplant patients [16,19], and in records preceeding sudden cardiac death [6,19]. The depression

of σwav(32) at these scales is likely associated with the impairment of autonomic nervous system function. Baroreﬂex
modulations of the sympathetic or parasympathetic tone typically lie in the range 0.04–0.09 Hz (11–25 sec), which
corresponds to the time range where σwav(m) is reduced.

The perfect separation achieved in our initial study of 20-h Holter-monitor recordings endorses the choice of σwav(32)
as a useful diagnostic measure. The results of most studies are seldom so clear-cut, however. When there is incomplete
separation between two classes of subjects, as observed for other less discriminating measures using these identical
long data sets [7,8], or when our measure is applied to large collections of out-of-sample or reduced-length data sets
[19], an objective means for determining the relative diagnostic abilities of diﬀerent measures is required.

ROC Analysis.– Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis [20] is an objective and highly eﬀective technique
for assessing the performance of a measure when it is used in binary hypothesis testing. This format provides that
a data sample be assigned to one of two hypotheses or classes (e.g., normal or pathologic) depending on the value
of some measured statistic relative to a threshold value. The eﬃcacy of a measure is then judged on the basis of
its sensitivity (the proportion of pathologic patients correctly identiﬁed) and its speciﬁcity (the proportion of control
subjects correctly identiﬁed). The ROC curve is a graphical presentation of sensitivity versus 1−speciﬁcity as a
threshold parameter is swept (see Fig. 1).

The area under the ROC curve serves as a well-established index of diagnostic accuracy [20]; a value of 0.5 arises
from assignment to a class by pure chance whereas the maximum value of 1.0 corresponds to perfect assignment (unity
sensitivity for all values of speciﬁcity). ROC analysis can be used to choose the best of a host of diﬀerent candidate
diagnostic measures by comparing their ROC areas, or to establish for a single measure the tradeoﬀ between reduced
data length and misidentiﬁcations (misses and false positives) by examining ROC area as a function of record length
(see Fig. 2). A minimum record length can then be speciﬁed to achieve acceptable classiﬁcation. Because ROC
analysis relies on no implicit assumptions about the statistical nature of the data set [18,20], it is more reliable and
appropriate for analyzing non-Gaussian time series than are measures of statistical signiﬁcance such as p-value and
d′ which are expressly designed for signals with Gaussian statistics [18]. Moreover, ROC curves are insensitive to the
units employed (e.g., spectral magnitude, magnitude squared, or log magnitude); ROC curves for a measure M are
identical to those for any monotonic transformation thereof such as M x or log(M ). In contrast the values of d′, and
its closely related cousins, change under such transformations. Unfortunately, this is not always recognized which
leads some authors to specious conclusions [21].

Scale-Dependent vs Scale-Independent Measures.– Wavelet analysis provides a ready comparison for scale-dependent
and scale-independent measures since it reveals both. ROC curves constructed using 75,821 R-R intervals from each
of the 24 data sets (12 heart failure, 12 normal) [15], are presented in Fig. 1 (left) for the wavelet measure σwav(32)
It is clear from Fig. 1 that the area under the
(using the Haar wavelet) as well as for the wavelet measure αW .
σwav(32) ROC curve is unity, indicating perfect discriminability. This scale-dependent measure clearly outperforms
the scale-independent measure αW which has signiﬁcantly smaller area. These results are found to be essentially
independent of the analyzing wavelet [6].

We now use ROC analysis to quantitatively compare the tradeoﬀ between reduced record length and misidentiﬁca-
tions for this standard set of heart-failure patients using three scale-dependent and three scale-independent measures.
In the ﬁrst category are the wavelet-coeﬃcient standard deviation σwav(32), its spectral counterpart S(1/32) [18,22],
and the interbeat-interval standard deviation σint. In the second category, we consider the wavelet scaling exponent
αW , the spectral scaling exponent αS, and a scaling exponent αD calculated according to detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA) [8].

In Fig. 2 (left) we present ROC area, as a function of R-R interval record length, using these six measures. The area
under the ROC curves forms the rightmost point in the ROC area curves. The ﬁle sizes are then divided into smaller
segments of length L. The area under the ROC curve is computed for the ﬁrst such segment for all 6 measures, and
then for the second segment, and so on for all segments of length L. From the Lmax/L values of the ROC area, the
mean and standard deviation are computed. The lengths L employed range from L = 26 = 64 to L = 216 = 65, 536
in powers of two.

The best performance is achieved by σwav(32) and S(1/32), both of which attain unity area (perfect separation)
for suﬃciently long R-R sequences. Even for fewer than 100 heartbeat intervals, corresponding to just a few minutes
of data, these measures provide excellent results (in spite of the fact that both diurnal and nocturnal records are
included). σint does not perform quite as well. The worst performance, however, is provided by the three scaling
exponents αW , αS, and αD, conﬁrming our previous ﬁndings [4–6]. Moreover, results obtained from the diﬀerent
power-law estimators diﬀer widely [23], suggesting that there is little merit in the concept of a single exponent, no less
a “universal” one [21], for characterizing the human heartbeat sequence. In a recent paper Amaral et al. [21] conclude
exactly the opposite, that the scaling exponents provide the best performance. This is because they improperly make
use of the Gaussian-based measures d2 and η, which are closely related to d′, rather than ROC analysis. These same

2

authors [21] also purport to glean information from higher moments of the wavelet coeﬃcients, but such information
is not reliable because estimator variance increases with moment order. The results presented here accord with those
obtained in a detailed study of 16 diﬀerent measures of HRV [18]. There are vast diﬀerences in the time required
to compute these measures however:
for 75,821 interbeat intervals, σwav(32) requires the shortest time (20 msec)
whereas DFA(32) requires the longest time (650,090 msec).

It will be highly useful to evaluate the relative performance of these measures for other records, both normal and

pathologic. In particular the correlation of ROC area with severity of cardiac dysfunction should be examined.

An issue of importance is whether the R-R sequences, and therefore the ROC curves, arise from deterministic chaos
[9]. We have carried out a phase-space analysis in which diﬀerences between adjacent R-R intervals are embedded.
This minimizes correlation in the time series which can interfere with the detection of deterministic dynamics. The
results indicate that the behavior of the underlying R-R sequences, both normal and pathological, appear to have
stochastic rather than deterministic origins [18].

Generating a realistic heartbeat sequence.– The generation of a mathematical point process that faithfully emulates
the human heartbeat could be of importance in a number of venues, including pacemaker excitation. Integrate-and-
ﬁre (IF) models, which are physiologically plausible, have been developed for use in cardiology. Berger et al. [24],
for example, constructed an integrate-and-ﬁre model in which an underlying rate function was integrated until it
reached a ﬁxed threshold, whereupon a point event was triggered and the integrator reset. Improved agreement with
experiment was obtained by modeling the stochastic component of the rate function as band-limited fractal Gaussian
noise (FGN), which introduces scaling behavior into the heart rate, and setting the threshold equal to unity [5]. This
fractal-Gaussian-noise integrate-and-ﬁre (FGNIF) model has been quite successful in ﬁtting a whole host of interval-
and count-based measures of the heartbeat sequence for both heart-failure patients and normal subjects [5]. However,
it is not able to accommodate the diﬀerences observed in the behavior of σwav(m) for the two classes of data.

To remedy this defect, we have constructed a jittered version of this model which we dub the fractal-Gaussian-noise
jittered integrate-and-ﬁre (FGNJIF) model [23]. The occurrence time of each point of the FGNIF is jittered by a
Gaussian distribution of standard deviation J. Increasing the jitter parameter imparts additional randomness to the
R-R time series at small scales, thereby increasing σwav at small values of m and, concomitantly, the power spectral
density at large values of the frequency f . The FGNJIF simulation does a rather good job of mimicing patient
and control data for a number of key measures used in heart-rate-variability analysis. The model is least successful
in ﬁtting the interbeat-interval histogram pτ (τ ), particularly for heart-failure patients. This indicates that that a
mechanism other than jitter for increasing σwav at low scales should be sought [18].

It is of interest to examine the global performance of the FGNJIF model using the collection of 24 data sets. To
achieve this we carried out FGNJIF simulations using parameters comparable with the actual data and constructed
simulated ROC curves for the measures σwav(32) and αW as shown in Fig. 1 (right). Similar simulations for ROC area
versus record length are displayed in Fig. 2 (right) for the six experimental measures considered. Overall, the global
simulations (right-hand side of Fig. 1 and 2) follow the trends of the data (left-hand side of Fig. 1 and 2) reasonably
well, with the exception of σint. This failure is linked to the inability of the simulated results to emulate the observed
interbeat-interval histograms. It will be of interest to consider modiﬁcations of the FGNIF model that might bring
the simulated ROC curves into better accord with the data-based curves.

[15] The R-R recordings used in Ref. [6] were drawn from the Beth-Israel Hospital (Boston, MA) Heart-Failure Database
comprising 12 records from normal subjects (age 29–64 years, mean 44 years) and 15 records from severe congestive heart-
failure patients (age 22–71 years, mean 56 years). The recordings were made with a Holter monitor digitized at a ﬁxed
value of 250 Hz. Three of the 15 heart-failure patients suﬀered from atrial ﬁbrillation. The analysis reported in this Letter
eliminates these three atrial-ﬁbrillation patients, and makes use of the ﬁrst 75,821 sinus-rhythm interbeat intervals from the
remaining 12 normal and 12 congestive heart-failure records. A detailed characterization of each of the records is presented
in Table 1 of Ref. [5]. The conclusions reported in this Letter remain intact even when the three atrial-ﬁbrillation patients
are included, as shown elsewhere [18].

FIG. 1. ROC curves (sensitivity vs 1−speciﬁcity) for two wavelet-based measures: σwav(32) which is scale-dependent and
αW which is scale-independent. Left: ROC curves obtained using all 24 data records, each comprising 75,821 interbeat intervals
[15]. The scale-dependent measure outperforms the scale-independent one since its ROC area is greater. Right: Comparable
result obtained using simulations for the fractal-Gaussian-noise jittered integrate-and-ﬁre (FGNJIF) model.

FIG. 2. Diagnostic accuracy (area under ROC curve) vs data length (number of R-R intervals) for three scale-dependent and
three scale-independent measures (mean ± one standard deviation). An area of unity corresponds to the correct assignment of
each patient to the appropriate class. Left: σwav(32) and S(1/32) provide excellent performance, attaining unity area (perfect
separation) for 32,768 (or more) R-R intervals. These measures continue to perform well even as the number of R-R intervals
decreases below 100, corresponding to record lengths just minutes long. The performance of σint is seen to be slightly inferior.
In contrast, all three scale-independent measures perform poorly. Right: Similar results are obtained using 24 simulations of
the FGNJIF model, with the exception of σint (see text).

Abstract

In complex systems the knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic be-

havior is essential to understand the processes going on there. Linear approaches are often

not sufﬁcient to describe these processes and several nonlinear methods require rather long

time observations. To overcome these difﬁculties, we propose measures of complexity based

on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to

heart rate variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us to detect tran-

sitions between chaotic and periodic states, as well as to identify additional laminar states,

i. e. chaos-chaos transitions. Traditional recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis fails to detect

these latter transitions. Applying our new measures to the heart rate variability data, we

are able to detect and quantify laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia

and, thus, to enable a prediction of such an event. Our ﬁndings could be of importance for the

therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous scientiﬁc disciplines as astrophysics, biology or geosciences use data anal-

ysis techniques to understand complex processes observed in nature [1–3], which

show generally nonstationary and complex behavior. In complex systems, different

transitions between regular, laminar and chaotic behavior are typical: the knowledge

of these transitions is necessary to understand the process. However, observational

data of these systems are typically rather short. Linear approaches of time series

analysis are often not sufﬁcient [4, 5] and most of the nonlinear techniques (cf. [6, 7]),

such as fractal dimensions or Lyapunov exponents [7–10], suffer from the curse of di-

mensionality and require rather long data series. The uncritical application of these

methods especially to natural data can, therefore, be very dangerous and it often

leads to serious pitfalls.

To overcome these difﬁculties, other measures of complexity have been proposed, such

as Renyi entropies, effective measure complexity, ε-complexity or renormalized en-

tropy [11, 12]. They are mostly based on symbolic dynamics and are efﬁcient quanti-

ties to characterize measurements of natural systems, such as in cardiology [13–15],

cognitive psychology [16] or astrophysics [17–19]. In this paper we focus on another

type of measures of complexity, which is based on the method of recurrence plots (RP).

This approach has been introduced for the analysis of nonstationary and rather short

data series [20–22]. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of recurrence plots has been in-

troduced to detect typical transitions (e. g. bifurcation points) in complex systems [23–

25]. However, the quantities introduced so far are not able to detect more complex

transitions, especially chaos-chaos transitions, which are also typical in nonlinear dy-

namical systems. Therefore, in this paper we will introduce measures of complexity

based on recurrence plots which allow to identify laminar states and their transitions

to regular as well as other chaotic regimes in complex systems. These measures en-

able us to investigate intermittency of processes even when they are only represented

by short and nonstationary data series.

The paper is organized as follows: First, the technique of recurrence plots and some

measures are shortly reviewed. Next, we introduce new measures of complexity

2

based on recurrence plots. Then, the new approach is applied to the logistic equa-

tion and we demonstrate the ability to detect chaos-chaos transitions. Finally, we

apply this technique to heart rate variability data [26]. We mainly demonstrate that

our new proposed methods are able to detect laminar phases before the onset of a

life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia.

II. RECURRENCE PLOTS AND THEIR QUANTIFICATION

The method of recurrence plots (RP) was ﬁrstly introduced to visualize the time de-

pendent behavior of the dynamics of systems ~xi (i = 1 . . . N), which can be pictured

as a trajectory in the n-dimensional phase space [21]. It represents the recurrence

of the phase space trajectory to a certain state, which is a fundamental property of

deterministic dynamical systems [27, 28]. The main step of this visualization is the

calculation of the N × N-matrix

Ri, j := Θ(εi − k~xi − ~xjk),

i, j = 1 . . . N,

(1)

where εi is a cut-off distance, k · k a norm (e. g. the Euclidean norm) and Θ(x) the

Heaviside function. The cut-off distance εi deﬁnes a ball centered at ~xi. If ~xj falls
within this ball, then this state is close to ~xi and thus Ri,j = 1. These εi can be

either constant for all ~xi [22] or they can vary in such a way, that the ball contains

a predeﬁned number of close states [21]. In this paper a ﬁxed εi and the Euclidean

norm are used, resulting in a symmetric RP. The binary values in Ri, j can be simply

visualized by a matrix plot with the colors black (1) and white (0).

The recurrence plot exhibits characteristic large-scale and small-scale patterns which

are caused by typical dynamical behavior [21, 24], e. g. diagonals (similar local evo-

lution of different parts of the trajectory) or horizontal and vertical black lines (state

does not change for some time).

Zbilut and Webber have recently developed the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis

(RQA) to quantify a RP [23–25]. They deﬁne measures using the recurrence point

3

density and diagonal structures in the recurrence plot, the recurrence rate, the de-

terminism, the maximal length of diagonal structures, the entropy and the trend. A

computation of these measures in small windows moving along the main diagonal

of the RP yields time dependent behavior of these variables and, thus, enables to

identify transitions in the time series [23].

The RQA measures are mostly based on the distribution of the length of the diagonal

structures in the RP. Additional information about further geometrical structures

as vertical and horizontal elements are not included. Gao has therefore recently

introduced a recurrence time statistics, which corresponds to vertical structures in a

RP [29, 30]. In the following, we will extend this view on the vertical structures and

deﬁne measures of complexity based on the distribution of the vertical line length.

Since we are using symmetric RPs here, in the following we will only consider the

vertical structures.

III. MEASURES OF COMPLEXITY

We consider a point ~xi of the trajectory and the set of its associated recurrence points
Si := {~xk : Ri, k
si := {~xl ∈ Si : (Ri, l · Ri, l+1) + (Ri, l · Ri, l−1) > 0 ;

!
= 1 ; k ∈ [1 . . . N − 1]}. Denote a subset of these recurrence points
l ∈ [1 . . . N], Ri, 0 = Ri, N +1 := 0}

which contains the recurrence points forming the vertical structures in the RP at

column i. In continuous time systems with high time resolution and with not too

small threshold ε, a large part of this set si usually corresponds with the sojourn

points described in [29, 30]. Although sojourn points do not occur in maps, the subset

si does not have to be empty. Next, we determine the length v of all connected subsets

{~xj 6∈ si; ~xj+1 . . . ~xj+v ∈ si; ~xj+v+1 6∈ si} in si. Pi(v) = {vl ; l = 1, 2, . . . L} denotes the set

of all occurring subset lengths in si and from S
of the vertical line lengths P (v) in the entire RP.

N
i=1 Pi(v) we determine the distribution

Analogous to the deﬁnition of the determinism [24, 31], we compute the ratio between

recurrence points forming vertical structures and the entire set of recurrence points

LAM :=

P

N
v=vmin vP (v)
N
v=1 vP (v)

P

,

(2)

and call it laminarity LAM. The computation of LAM is realized for v which exceeds

a minimal length vmin. For maps we use vmin = 2. LAM is a measure of the amount of

vertical structures in the whole RP and represents the occurrence of laminar states in

the system, but does not describe the length of these laminar phases. It will decrease

if the RP consists of more single recurrence points than vertical structures.

Next, we deﬁne the averaged length of vertical structures

T T :=

N
v=vmin vP (v)
N
v=vmin P (v)

,

P

P

(3)

(4)

what we call trapping time T T . The computation uses also the minimal length vmin

as LAM. The measure T T contains information about the amount and the length of

the vertical structures in the RP.

Finally, we use the maximal length of the vertical structures in the RP

Vmax = max ({vl ; l = 1, 2, . . . L})

as a measure, which is the analogue to the standard RQA measure Lmax [24].

Although the distribution of the diagonal line lengths contains information about

the vertical line lengths too, these both distributions are signiﬁcantly different. To

compare our proposed with the standard RQA measures we apply them to the logistic

map.

IV. APPLICATION TO THE LOGISTIC MAP

To investigate the potentials of LAM, T T and Vmax, we ﬁrstly analyze the logistic map

xn+1 = a xn (1 − xn)

(5)

especially the interesting range of the control parameter a ∈ [3.5, 4] with a step width

of ∆a = 0.0005. Starting with the idea of Trulla et al. [23] to look for vertical struc-

tures, we are especially interested in the laminar states to ﬁnd chaos-chaos transi-

tions. Therefore, we generate for each control parameter a a separate time series. In

the analyzed range of a ∈ [3.5, 4] various regimes and transitions between them occur,

5

e. g. accumulation points, periodic and chaotic states, band merging points, period

doublings, inner and outer crisis [27, 32, 33].

A useful tool for studying the chaotic behavior are the recursively formed supertrack

functions

si+1(a) = a si(a)(cid:0)1 − si(a)(cid:1),

s0(a) =

(6)

1
2

,

which represent the functional dependence of stable states [32]. The intersection

of si(a) with si+j(a) indicates the occurrence of a j-period cycle and the intersection

with the ﬁxed-point (1 − 1/a) of the Eq. 5 indicates the point of an unstable singular-

ity, i. e. laminar behavior (Fig. 1, intersection points are marked with dotted lines).

For each a we compute a time series of the length N = 2, 000. To exclude transient

responses we use the last 1, 000 values of these data series for the following analysis.

We compute the RP after embedding the time series with a dimension of m = 1, a

delay of τ = 1 and a cut-off distance of ε = 0.1 (in units of the standard deviation σ).

Since the considered example is a one-dimensional map, m = 1 is enough. In general,

too small embedding leads to false recurrences which is expressed in countless ver-

tical structures and diagonals from upper left to lower right corner. Whereas false

recurrences do not inﬂuence the measures basing on diagonal structures [30], the

measures basing on vertical structures are, in general, sensitive to it. For the logistic

map, however, an increasing of m ampliﬁes the peaks of the vertical based complexity

measures a little (up to m = 3), but it does not change the result considerably. The

cut-off distance ε is selected as to be 10 percent of the diameter of the reconstructed

phase space. Smaller values would lead to a better distinction of small variations

(e. g. the range before the accumulation point consists of small variations). However,

the recurrence points density decreases in the same way and thus the statistics of

continuous structures in the RP becomes soon insufﬁcient. Larger values cause a

higher recurrence points density, but a lower sensitivity to small variations.

A. Recurrence Plots of the Logistic Map

For various values of the control parameter a we obtain RPs, which exhibit already

speciﬁc features (Fig. 2). Periodic states (e. g. in the periodic window of length three

6

at a = 3.830) cause continuous and periodic diagonal lines in the RP of a width of one.

There are no vertical or horizontal lines (Fig. 2 A). Band merging points and other

cross points of supertrack functions (e. g. a = 3.720, Fig. 2 C) represent states with

short laminar behavior and cause vertically and horizontally spread black areas in

the RP. The band merging at a = 3.679 causes frequent laminar states and, hence, a

lot of vertically and horizontally spread black areas in the RP (Fig. 2 B). Fully devel-

oped chaotic states (a = 4) cause a rather homogeneous RP with a lot of single points

and rare short diagonal or vertical lines (Fig. 2 D).

B. Complexity Measures of the Logistic Map

Now we compute the known RQA measures DET , Lmax and in addition hLi (averaged

length of diagonal lines) and our measures LAM, Vmax and T T for the entire RP of

each control parameter a. As expected, the known RQA measures DET , Lmax and

hLi clearly detect the transitions from chaotic to periodic sequences and vice versa

(Fig. 3 A, C, E) [23]. However, it seems to be that one cannot get more informa-

tion than periodic-chaotic/ chaotic-periodic transitions. Near the supertrack crossing

points (band merging points included), e. g. a = 3.678, 3.791, 3.927, there are no sig-

niﬁcant indications in these RQA measures. They clearly identify bifurcation points

(periodic-chaotic/ chaotic-periodic transitions), however they do not ﬁnd chaos-chaos

transitions and laminar states.

Calculating the vertical based measures LAM and T T , we are able to identify these

states too (Fig. 3 B, F). The occurrence of vertical lines starts shortly before the band

merging from two to one band at a = 3.678 . . .

For smaller a-values the consecutive points jump between the two bands, thus one

cannot get laminar behavior. Longer persistence of states is not possible until all

bands are merged. However, due to the ﬁnite range of neighborhood searching in the

phase space, vertical lines occur before this point.

Vertical lines occur much more frequently at supertrack crossing points (band merg-

ing points included), than in other chaotic regimes, what is revealed by LAM

(cf. Fig. 3 B, again, supertrack crossing points are marked with dotted lines). As

7

in the states before the merging from two to one band, vertical lines are not found

within periodic windows, e. g. a = 3.848. The mean of the distribution of v is the intro-

duced measure T T (Fig. 3 F). It vanishes for such a smaller than the point of merging

from two to one band. T T increases at points where more low ordered supertrack

functions are crossing (Fig. 3 F). This corresponds with the occurrence of laminar

states. Although Vmax reveals also laminar states, it is quite different from the other

two measures, because it gives the maximum of all of the durations of the laminar

states. However, periodic states are also associated with vanishing T T and Vmax.

Hence, the vertical length based measures ﬁnd periodic-chaotic/ chaotic-periodic and

chaos-chaos transitions (laminar states).

We have also computed LAM, Vmax and T T for the logistic map with transients with

the same approach described in [23]. The qualitative statement of the measures is

the same as above.

V. APPLICATION TO HEART RATE VARIABILITY DATA

Heart rate variability (HRV) typically shows a complex behavior and it is difﬁcult

to identify disease speciﬁc patterns [34]. An important challenge in cardiology is to

ﬁnd early signs of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) in patients with an implanted

cardioverter-deﬁbrillator (ICD) based on HRV data [26, 35–37]. Therefore, standard

HRV parameters from time and frequency domain [38], parameters from symbolic

dynamics [13, 14] as well as the ﬁnite-time growth rates [39] were applied to the

data of a clinical pilot study [26]. Using two nonlinear approaches we have recently

found signiﬁcant differences between control and VT time series mainly basing on

laminar phases in the data before VT. Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to

test whether our RP approach is suitable to ﬁnd and quantify these laminar phases.

The deﬁbrillators used in study cited (PCD 7220/7221, Medtronic) are able to store

at least 1000 beat-to-beat intervals prior to the onset of VT (10 ms resolution), cor-

responding to approximately 9–15 minutes. We reanalyze these intervals from 17

chronic heart failure ICD patients just before the onset of a VT and at a control time,

i.e. without a following arrhythmic event. Time series including more than one non-

8

sustained VT, with induced VT’s, pacemaker activity or more than 10 % of ventricular

premature beats were not considered in this analysis. Some patients had several VT’s

– we ﬁnally had 24 time series with a subsequent VT and the respective 24 control

series without a life-threatening arrhythmia. In order to analyze only the dynamics

occurring just before a VT, the beat-to-beat intervals of the VT itself at the end of the

time series are removed from the tachograms.

We calculate all standard RQA parameters described in [24] as well as the new mea-

sures laminarity LAM, trapping time T T and maximal vertical line length Vmax (in

similarity to the maximal diagonal line length Lmax) for different embedding dimen-

sions m and nearest neighbor radii ε. We ﬁnd differences between both groups of data

for several of the parameters above, however, the most signiﬁcant parameters were

Vmax and Lmax for rather high radii (Tab. I). The vertical line length Vmax is more

powerful in discriminating both groups than the diagonal line length Lmax (Tab. I).

Figure 4 gives a typical example of the recurrence plots before a VT and at a control

time with an embedding of 6 and a radius of 110. The RP before a life-threatening

arrhythmia is characterized by large black rectangles (Vmax = 242 here), whereas the

RP from the control series only shows small rectangles (Vmax = 117).

VI. SUMMARY

We have introduced three new recurrence plot (RP) based measures of complexity,

the laminarity LAM, the trapping time T T and the maximal length of vertical struc-

tures in the RP Vmax. These measures of complexity have been applied to the logistic

map and heart rate variability data. In contrast to the known RQA measures ([23],

[25]), which are able to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states (and

vice versa), our new measures enable to identify laminar states too, i. e. chaos-chaos

transitions. These measures are provided by the vertical lines in recurrence plots.

The occurrence of vertical (and horizontal) structures is directly related with the oc-

currence of laminar states.

The laminarity LAM enables generally to detect laminar states in a dynamical sys-

tem. The trapping time T T contains information about the frequency of the laminar

states and their length. The maximal length Vmax reveals information about the time

duration of the laminar states and, thus, enables to investigate intermittency.

If the embedding of the data is too small, it will lead to false recurrences which is

expressed in countless vertical structures and diagonals perpendicular to the main

diagonal. Whereas false recurrences do not inﬂuence the measures basing on diago-

nal structures, the measures basing on vertical structures are sensitive to it.

The application of these measures to the logistic equation for a range of various con-

trol parameters has revealed points of laminar states without any additional knowl-

edge about the characteristic parameters or dynamical behavior of the speciﬁc sys-

tems. Nevertheless, LAM, Vmax and T T are different in their magnitudes. Further

investigations are necessary to understand all relations between the magnitudes of

Vmax and the recognized chaos-chaos transitions.

The application of the new complexity measures to the ICD stored heart rate data

before the onset of a life-threatening arrhythmia seems to be very successful to detect

laminar phases and thus to enable a prediction of such VT. The differences between

10

VT and control series are more signiﬁcant as in [26]. However, two limitations of this

study are the relative small number of time series and the reduced statistical analysis

(no subdivisions concerning age, sex and heart disease). For this reason, these results

have to be validated on a larger data base. Furthermore, this investigation could be

enhanced for tachograms including more than 10% ventricular premature beats. In

conclusion, this study has demonstrated that RQA based complexity measures could

be meaningful for the prediction of VT events even in short term HRV time series.

Many biological data contain epochs of laminar states, which can be detected and

quantiﬁed by RP based measures. We have demonstrated differences between verti-

cal and diagonal structures, therefore, in addition to traditional measures we suggest

to use our introduced methods.

havior (cf. Fig. 1), whereby not all of them have been marked. Whereas DET (A), Lmax (C)

and hLi (E) show periodic-chaotic/ chaotic-periodic transitions (maxima), LAM (B), Vmax (D)

and T T (F) exhibit in addition to those transitions (minima) chaotic-chaotic transitions (max-

ima). The differences between LAM and Vmax is caused by the fact, that LAM measures only

the amount of laminar states, whereas Vmax measures the maximal duration of the laminar

states. Although some peaks of Vmax and T T are not at the dotted lines, they correspond with

laminar states (not all can be marked).

FIG. 4: Recurrence plots at a control time (A) and before a VT (B) with an embedding of 6 and

a radius of 110. The RP before an life-threatening arrhythmia is characterized by big black

rectangles whereas the RP from the control series only show small rectangles.

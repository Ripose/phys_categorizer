To discuss the salient role of the statistical memory eﬀects in the human brain functioning we

have analyzed a set of stochastic memory quantiﬁers that reﬂects the dynamical characteristics of

neuromagnetic brain responses to a ﬂickering stimulus of diﬀerent color combinations from a group

of control subjects which is contrasted with those from a patient with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE).

We have discovered the emergence of strong memory and the accompanying transition to a regular

and robust regime of chaotic behavior of the signals in the separate areas for a patient with PSE.

This ﬁnding most likely identiﬁes the regions of the location the protective mechanism in a human

organism against occurrence of PSE.

Increasing attention has been paid recently to the study of statistical memory eﬀects in random processes that

originate from nature by means of nonequilibrium statistical physics. The role of memory has its roots in natural

sciences since 1906 when the famous Russian mathematician Markov wrote his ﬁrst paper on the theory of Markov

Random Processes (MRP) [1]. His theory is based on the notion of an instant loss of memory from the prehistory

(memoryless property) of random processes. In contrast, there are an abundance of physical phenomena and processes

which can be characterized by statistical memory eﬀects: kinetic and relaxation processes in gases [2] and plasma

[3], condensed matter physics (liquids [4], solids [5], and superconductivity [6]), astrophysics [7], nuclear physics [8],

quantum [9] and classical [10] physics, to name only a few. At present, we can make use of a variety of statistical

methods for the analysis of the memory eﬀects in diverse physical systems. Typical such schemes are Zwanzig-Mori’s

kinetic equations [11], generalized master equations and corresponding statistical quantiﬁers [12], Lee’s recurrence

relation method [13], the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) [14], etc.

In this paper we shall demonstrate that the presence of statistical memory eﬀects is of salient importance for the

functioning of healthy physiological systems. Particularly, it can imply that the presence of large memory times scales

in the stochastic dynamics of discrete time series can characterize pathological (or catastrophical) violation of salutary

dynamic states of the human brain. As an example, we will demonstrate here that the emergence of strong memory

time scales in the chaotic behavior of neuromagnetic responses of human brain as recorded by MEG is accompanied

by the likely initiation and the existence of PSE.

First consider a simpliﬁed version of the Markov processes.

Let us introduce the conditional probability

K1(x1, t1|x2, t2) that x is found in the range (x2, x2 + dx2) at x2, if x had the value x1 at t1. For the Markov

random process the conditional probability that x lies in the range (xn, xn + dxn) at tn given that x had the values

x1, x2, ...xn−1 at times t1, t2, ....tn−1 depends only on xn−1 is as follows: Kn−1(x1, t1; x2, t2; ...xn−1, tn−1|xn, tn) =

K1(xn−1, tn−1|xn, tn). The equation states that, given the state of a Markov process at some times tn−1 < tn, the

forthcoming (future) state of the process at tn is independent of all previous states at prior times. The equation is

the standard deﬁnition of the Markov random process. So, from the physical point of view the Markov process is the

process without aftereﬀect. It means that the ”future ” and the ”past” of a process not depend each from other at

known ”present”.

Measures for memory. One of the ﬁrst measure of ’memory’ in physiological time series that has been studied in

electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals, both of healthy subjects and patients

(including epilepsy patients)[15] was the detrended-ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [16].

For the quantitative description of statistical memory eﬀects of random processes in the physiological data the use

of Zwanzi-Mori kinetic equations provides an appropriate and most convenient methodology.

In particular, using

the reasoning put forward in Refs. [17] one can obtain the chain of interconnected kinetic equations for the discrete
time correlation function (TCF) a(t) ≡ M0(t) = hδx(t)δx(0)i/hδx2(0)i of the ﬂuctuation δx(t) = x(t) − hx(t)i, where

x(t) = (x1; x2; ...; xN ) is a random discrete-time process, i.e., xj = xj(tj ), tj=j τ , where τ is a discretization time-step,

j = 1, 2, ...N . This zeroth-order function is then related iteratively to higher order memory functions Mi(t), i = 1, 2, ....

In this approach the set discrete memory functions Mi(t), i = 1, 2, ... (MF’s) of i th order together with corresponding

relaxation parameters quantify the memory eﬀects. The full set of MF’s includes all peculiarities of the memory eﬀects

for real complex systems. For the discrete time series the whole set of functions Mi(t) and relaxation parameters can

be calculated directly from the experimental data [17].

Following the reasoning put forward with Refs.

[17] provides the adequate tools to study the role of memory

eﬀects in discrete time complex systems dynamics. The characterization of memory is based on a set of dimensionless

statistical quantiﬁers which are capable of measuring the strength of memory that is inherent in the complex dynamics.
A ﬁrst such measure is is εi(ω) = {µi(ω)/µi+1(ω)}1/2 whereas the as second set of measure follows as δi(ω) = | ˜M ′
i+1(ω)|. Here, µi(ω) = | ˜Mi(ω)|2 denotes a power spectrum of the corresponding memory function Mi(t), ˜M ′
˜M ′

i (ω) =

i (ω)/

3

d ˜Mi(ω)/dω and ˜Mi(ω) is a Fourier transform of the memory function Mi(t). The measures εi(ω) are suitable for

the quantiﬁcation of the memory on a relative scale whereas the second set δi(ω) proves useful for quantifying the

ampliﬁcation of relative memory eﬀects occurring on diﬀerent complexity levels. Both measures provide statistical

criteria for the comparison of the relaxation time scales and memory time scales of the process under study. For values

obeying {ε, δ} >> 1 one can observe a complex dynamics characterized by short-ranged temporal memory scales. In

the limit these processes assume a δ-like memory with ε, δ → ∞. When {ε, δ} > 1 one deals with a situation with

moderate memory strength, and the case with both ε, δ ∼ 1 typically constitutes a more regular and robust process

possessing strong memory features.

Figure 1: Time dependence of TCF M0(t)(i = 0) and ﬁrst two subordinate MF’s Mi(t), i = 1, 2 for a healthy subject (No.

6) (blue) and for a patient (red) with PSE for the SQUID’s number n = 10, τ = 0, 2 ms. The drastic distinctions of Mi(t)

in a healthy person as compared to a patient with PSE is clearly detectable. They consist in the appearance of signiﬁcant

long-ranged oscillations in a healthy subject and the suppression of high frequency noise in a patient with PSE.

Experimental data for PSE . Next, we can proceed directly to the analysis of the experimental data: MEG signals

recorded from a group of nine healthy human subjects and in a patient with (PSE) [18]. PSE is a common type of

stimulus-induced epilepsy, deﬁned as recurrent convulsions precipitated by visual stimuli, particularly a ﬂickering light.

The diagnosis of PSE involves ﬁnding paroxysmal spikes on an EEG in response to the intermittent light stimulation.

To elucidate the color-dependency of PS in normal subjects, brain activities subjected to uniform chromatic ﬂickers

with whole-scalp MEG has been measured in Ref. [18] (further details of the MEG experiment one can ﬁnd in [18].

Nine-right-handled healthy adults (two females, seven males; age range 22-27years) voluntarily participated. Sub-

jects were screened for photosensitivity and personal or family history of epilepsy. The experimental procedures

followed the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the National Children’s Hospital in Japan. All subjects

gave their informed consent after the aim and potential risk of the experiment were explained. During the recording,

the subjects sat in the magnetically shielded room and were instructed to observe visual stimuli passively without

moving their eyes.

Stimuli were generated by the two video projectors and delivered to the viewing window in the shield room through

4

an optical ﬁber bundle. Each projector continuously produced a single color stimulus. Liquid crystal shutters were

located between the optical device and the projectors. By alternative opening one of the shutters for 50 ms, 10 Hz

(square-wave) chromatic ﬂicker was produced on the viewing distance of 30 cm. Three color combination were used

: red-green (R/G), blue-green (B/G), and red-blue (R/B). CIE coordinates were x=0.496, y=0.396 for red; x=0.308,
y=0.522 for green; and x=0.153, y= 0.122 for blue. All color stimuli had a luminance of 1.6 cd/m2 in otherwise total

darkness. In a single trial, the stimulus was presented for 2s and followed by an inter-trial interval of 3s, during which

no visual stimulus was displayed. In a single session, color combination was ﬁxed.

Neuromagnetic responses were measured with a 122-channel whole-scalp neoromagnetometer (Neuromag-122; Neu-

romag Ltd. Finland). The neoromag-122 has 61 sensor locations, each containing two originally oriented planner

gradiometers coupled to dc-SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) sensors. The two sensors of each

location measure two orthogonal tangential derivatives of the brain magnetic ﬁeld component perpendicular to the

surface of the sensor array. The planner gradiometers measure the strongest magnetic signals directly above local

cortical currents. From 200 ms prior responses were analog-ﬁltered (bandpass frequency 0.03-100 Hz) and digitized

at 0.5 kHz. Eye movements and blinks were monitored by measuring an electro-oculogram. Trials with MEG am-

plitudes > 3000 fT/cm and/or electro-oculogram amplitudes > 150 µV were automatically rejected from averaging.

Trials were repeated until > 80 responses were averaged for each color-combination. The averaged MEG signals were

digitally lowpass-ﬁltered at 40 Hz, and then the DC oﬀset during the baseline (−100 to 0 ms) was removed. At each

sensor location, the magnetic waveform amplitude was calculated as the vector sum of the orthogonal components.

Peak amplitude were normalized within each subject with respect to the subject’s maximum amplitude. The latency

range from −100 to −1100 ms was divided with 100 ms bins. Then, the peak amplitudes were calculated by averaging

all peak amplitudes within each bin.

Memory analysis for presence of PSE .

With our set of Figs. 1-5 we present the results of numerical calculations and the analysis of the experimental

data within the framework of the nonequilibrium statistical approach for stochastic processes in the discrete complex

systems [17]. In Figs. 1 - 3 we depict the typical data for one concrete healthy subject (No. 6) in comparison with a

PSE patient for the case of a Red-Blue (RB) combination of the color stimulus. To make the conclusion about the

role of the statistical memory eﬀects we also show the averaged data for the whole group of nine healthy subjects

versus the patient with PSE in Figs. 4, 5.

Fig. 1 depicts the time dependence of the time correlation function (TCF) M0(t) and the ﬁrst two MF’s Mi(t),

i = 1, 2 for a healthy subject (No. 6) (blue) versus a patient with PSE (red). The TCF M0(t) displays long-ranged

oscillations in the healthy and a sharp decay for the patient with PSE. As one can observe from Figs. 2, where the
power spectra of TCF and MF’s are represented, the fractal dependence at order 0; i.e., µ0(ω) ∼ ω−α with α = 1, 74 in

the TCF of the healthy person (blue) now transforms into a group of peaks corresponding to α, β, γ, δ and θ rhythms

in frequency behavior of the subordinate quantiﬁers µi(ω), with i = 1, 2, 3. The typical picture in the patient with

PSE (red) consists in (i) the characteristic absence of the fractal dependence for µ0(ω), in (ii) the disappearance of

the well-deﬁned manifestation of physiological e/m rhythms and (iii) in the appearance of a single spike peak at the

Figure 2: Power spectra µi(ω), i = 0, 1, 2 for the MF’s in a healthy person (blue) and in the patient with PSE (red) for sensor

number n=10 in double-log scale. The spectra in the healthy person(No. 6) demonstrate the presence of electromagnetic waves

on characteristic frequency scales of α, β, γ, δ and θ rhythms (in µ2(ω)). One can observe the noticeable peaks of electromagnetic

excitations in a patient with PSE near 50 Hz and 100 Hz. The similar peaks are present in many other sensors of the human
cerebral cortex with PSE. The fractal dependence µ0(ω) ∼ ω

that typiﬁes a healthy person is absent in a patient with PSE.

This transition plays a crucial role for the emergence of strong memory in a patient with PSE.

reduction by a factor 1/56, 5 in the zero-frequency value ε1(ω = 0) occurs from the healthy person as compared to the patient

The most instructive singularities in the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst three points of the measure of memory

the sensor number on the human cerebral cortex. The crucial role of the strong memory for n = 10, 46, 51, 53 and 59 is clearly

detectable. All sensors depicting ε1(0ω = 0; n) surely demonstrate the emergence of statistical memory eﬀects in the chaotic

behavior of magnetic signals. Nevertheless, the role strong memory eﬀects, i.e. minimum values for ε1(ω = 0; n), appreciable

in the area of the frequencies of the brain rhythms for the third point ε3(ω). This behavior is characteristic only of

the healthy subjects. The role of increasing memory and the persistent transition from a more random (healthy) into

a robust, more regular regime of the underlying chaotic process at all three subordinate measures εi(ω), i = 1, 2, 3

is clearly detectable in the patient with PSE. The crucial role of the strong memory at the ﬁrst level, i.e. for ε1 is

reﬂected by a decrease of the memory measure ε1(ω0 = 0) by a factor of ca. 56. Moreover, there occurs a drastic

change of the frequency spectra for ε2(ω) and ε3(ω).

The topographic dependence of ε1(ω = 0; n) depicted in Fig. 4 demonstrates the existence of the long-range time

correlation accompanied by a pronounced increase of the role of the statistical memory eﬀects in all MEG’s sensors

with sensor numbers n = 1, 2, ...61 in a patient with PSE as compared to healthy persons. There occurs about one

magnitude of diﬀerence between healthy subject and subject with PSE.

To specify the role of the strong memory we further study the spatial dependence in terms of a novel information

measure, the index of memory, which is deﬁned by:

ν(n) = δhealthy

see in Fig. 5. This measure quantiﬁes the sharp revising of memory eﬀects in individual MEG sensors in the patient

with PSE versus the healthy group. The sharp increase of the role of the memory eﬀects in the stochastic behavior

of the magnetic signals is clearly visible for sensor numbers n = 10, 46, 51, 53 and 59. The observed points of MEG

sensors locate the regions of a protective mechanism against PSE in a human organism: frontal (sensor 10), occipital

in the patient with PSE and thus emphasizes the crucial role of the location and the pathological mechanism of PSE.

(sensors 46, 51 and 53) and right parietal (sensor 59) regions. The early activity in these sensors may reﬂect the

protective mechanism that suppresses cortical hyperactivity due to chromatic ﬂickering.

One might remark that some earlier steps towards the understanding the normal and diseased human brain have

already been set in other ﬁelds of science such as neurology, clinical neurophysiology,neuroscience and so on. The

numerous studies applying linear and nonlinear time series analysis to EEG and MEG in epileptic patients are

discussed in details in Refs. [18], [19] with taking into account the neurophysiological basis of epilepsy, in particular

photosensitive epilepsy. Speciﬁcally, the results of [18] suggested that a signiﬁcant nonlinear structure was evident in

the MEG signals for control subjects, whereas nonlinearity was not detected for the patient. In addition, the couplings

between distant cortical regions were found to be greater for control subjects. The important role of combinational

chromatic sensitivity in sustained cortical excitation was also conﬁrmed. These prior ﬁnding lead to the hypothesis

that the healthy human brain is most likely equipped with signiﬁcantly nonlinear neuronal processing reﬂecting an

inherent mechanism defending against hyper-excitation to chromatic ﬂickering stimulus, and such nonlinear mechanism

is likely to be impaired for a patient with PSE.

Conclusions. This study of the chaotic behavior of the neuromagnetic signals of a human MEG’s with PSE and

in a group of healthy subjects elucidates the role of the statistical memory as an important criterion, measuring

the functioning of the human brain. Even an insigniﬁcant ampliﬁcation of the memory eﬀects tests the pathological

changes in the brain of a patient with PSE. The pronounced sharp increases of memory eﬀects in our set of statistical

quantiﬁers in the neuromagnetic signals indicates the pathological state of a patient with PSE within separate areas

of the brain. Our approach, being conveniently constructed from the set of subordinate memory functions yielding

the rate of change of the autocorrelation function of the measured complexity dynamics, allows one to characterize

8

the neuromagnetic signals in the human brain in terms of statistical indicators. These so constructed statistical

quantiﬁers in turn measure both the role and the strength of statistical memory which the underlying time series

accommodates. Many natural phenomena are described by distributions with time scale-invariant behavior [20].

The suggested approach allows the stochastic dynamics of neuromagnetic signals in human brain to be treated in a

probabilistic manner and to search for its statistical singularities.

From the physical point of view the obtained results can be used as a test to identify the presence or absence of brain

anomalies as they occur in a patient with PSE. The set of our quantiﬁers is uniquely associated with the emergence

of memory eﬀects in the chaotic behavior of the human cerebral cortex. The registration of the behavior of those

indicators as discussed here is then of beneﬁcial use to detect the pathological state of separate areas (sensors 10, 46,

51, 53 and 59) in the human brain of a patient with PSE. There exist also other quantiﬁers of a diﬀerent nature, such

as the Lacunae’s exponent, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, correlation dimension, etc., which are widely used in nonlinear

dynamics and related applications, see in Ref.

[21].

In the present context, we ﬁnd that the employed memory

measures are not only convenient for analysis but also ideally suited to identify anomalous brain behavior. The search

for yet other quantiﬁers, and foremost, the optimization of such measures when applied to complex, discrete time

dynamics presents a true challenge. This objective particularly holds true when attempts are made to identify and

quantify an anomalous functioning in living systems. The present work presents such an initial step towards the

understanding of fundamentals of physiological processes in the human brain.

PSE is a type of reﬂexive epilepsy which originates mostly in visual cortex (both striate and extra-striate) but with

high possibility towards propagating to other cortical regions [22]. Healthy brain may possibly possess an inherent

controlling (or defensive) mechanism against this propagation of cortical excitations, breakdown of which makes the

brain vulnerable to trigger epileptic seizures in patients [23]. However, the exact origin and dynamical nature of this

putative defensive mechanism is not yet fully known. Earlier we showed [18] that brain responses against chromatic

ﬂickering in healthy subjects represent strong nonlinear structures where as nonlinearity is dramatically reduced to

minimal in patients. Here we report that patient’s brain show signiﬁcantly stronger statistical memory eﬀects than

healthy brains. A complex network composed of interacting nonlinear system with memory component is inherently

stable and critically robust against external perturbations. Quick inhibitory eﬀect, that is essential for the prevention

of PSE, is made possible by the faster signal processing between distant regions. Further, such network is capable

to facilitate ﬂexible and spontaneous transitions between many possible conﬁgurations as opposed to being entrained

or locked with the external perturbations [24]. In short, our ﬁndings are in line with growing body of evidence that

physiological systems generate activity ﬂuctuations on many temporal and spatial scales and that pathological states

are associated with an impairment of this spatio-temporally complex structure.

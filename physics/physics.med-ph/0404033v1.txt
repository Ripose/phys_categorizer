Wavelet transform of polarized ﬂuorescence spectroscopic data of human breast tissues is found
to reliably diﬀerentiate normal and malignant tissue types and isolate characteristic biochemical
signatures of cancerous tissues, which can possibly be used for diagnostic purpose. A number of
parameters capturing spectral variations and subtle changes in the diseased tissues in the visible
wavelength regime are clearly identiﬁable in the wavelet domain. These investigations, corroborated
with tissue phantoms, indicate that the observed diﬀerences between malignant tumor and normal
samples are primarily ascribable to the changes in concentration of porphyrin and density of cellular
organelles present in tumors.

Breast cancer has emerged as the most common disease
amongst women [1]. Although the risk factor for Asian
women has been estimated to be one-ﬁfth to one-tenth
that of women in North America and Western Europe, it
still is the second most malignant condition [2, 3]. Apart
from genetic predisposition, a number of factors like diet,
exercise, environment, etc., are being recognized to play
major roles in the growth of the disease [4]. Early diag-
nosis is still not possible through conventional diagnostic
techniques. If diagnosed early, breast cancer is also one
of the most treatable forms of cancer. The requirement
of continuous monitoring for breast malignancy of a sig-
niﬁcant percentage of women population has led to an
intense search for safe, reliable and fast diagnostic meth-
ods.

Optical diagnosis techniques are now emerging as vi-
able tools for tumor detection. Of these, ﬂuorescence
techniques are being increasingly employed to investi-
gate both morphological and biochemical changes in dif-
ferent tissue types, for eventual application in the de-
tection of tumors at an early stage [5]. Fluorescence
spectroscopy is well suited for the diagnosis of cancer-
ous tissues because of its sensitivity to minute variations
in the amount and the local environment of the native
ﬂuorophores present in the tissues [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Mor-
phological changes prevalent in tumors, such as enlarge-
ment and hyperchromasia of nuclei, overcrowding and
irregular cellular arrangement are known to alter light
propagation and scattering properties in such media and
hence aﬀect the ﬂuorescence spectra [11]. A number of
ﬂuorophores ranging from structural proteins to various
enzymes and coenzymes, some of which participate in
the cellular oxidation-reduction processes, are present in
the human tissue and can be excited by ultraviolet and
visible light [6]. The ﬂuorophores, FAD (Flavin Adenine
Dinucleotide), its derivatives and porphyrins are partic-
ularly useful as ﬂuorescent markers, since they ﬂuoresce
in the higher wavelength visible region, when excited by

lower wavelength visible light, thereby avoiding the po-
tentially harmful ultraviolet radiation.

The ﬂuorescence emission can diﬀer signiﬁcantly in
normal and cancerous tissues due to the diﬀerences in
concentrations of absorbers [12, 13] and scatterers, as
also the scatterer sizes [14]. The absorption in the visi-
ble range occurs primarily due to the presence of blood,
whose amounts vary in various tissue types [15]. The
presence of scatterers leads to randomization of light,
thereby generating a depolarized component in the ﬂu-
orescence spectra. Polarized ﬂuorescence spectroscopy
is useful in isolating the characteristic spectral features
from the diﬀuse background. The parallel component of
the ﬂuorescence suﬀers fewer scattering events. In com-
parison, the intensity of the perpendicular component is
not only aﬀected more by scatterers, but is also quite
sensitive to absorption, since the path traversed by the
same in the tissue medium is more. Hence, the diﬀerence
of parallel and perpendicular intensities, apart from be-
ing relatively free from the diﬀusive component [16], can
be quite sensitive to microscopic biochemical changes in-
cluding the eﬀects of absorption in diﬀerent tissue types.

A number of studies conducted so far have established
certain broad morphological and biochemical changes oc-
curring in tumor tissues, which leave characteristic sig-
natures in the spectral domain [17]. The analyses of
spectral data involve both physical [18, 19, 20, 21] and
statistical [15, 22] modelling of tissue types, as also sta-
tistical methods, e.g., principal component analysis for
extracting distinguishing parameters for diagnostic pur-
poses [15] . The fact that biological tissues are complex
systems, possessing substantial variations among individ-
ual patients, depending upon various factors such as age,
progress of the disease, etc., makes modelling of the same
rather diﬃcult. In using statistical tools, diﬃculty often
arises in relating the statistically signiﬁcant quantities to
physically transparent spectral variables. In recent times,
wavelet transform has emerged as a powerful tool for the

analysis of transient data and is particularly useful in
disentangling characteristic variations at diﬀerent scales
[23]. This linear transform isolates local features and
leads to a convenient dimensional reduction of the data
in the form of low-pass (average) coeﬃcients, resembling
the data itself. The wavelet or high-pass coeﬃcients, at
various levels, encapsulate the variations at correspond-
ing scales. The higher-level coeﬃcients, particularly the
global parameters associated with them, like power, are
less contaminated by statistical and experimental uncer-
tainties present in the data. An earlier study, of the
perpendicular component of the ﬂuorescence spectra, by
some of the present authors has indicated the usefulness
of wavelet transform in identifying characteristic spectral
features [24].

Here, we present the results of a systematic analysis
of the wavelet transform of the ﬂuorescence spectra from
human breast tissues for malignant and normal tissues.
The diﬀerence between parallel and perpendicular com-
ponents of the ﬂuorescence spectra is subjected to this
analysis, since the same is comparatively free of the dif-
fusive component. A number of parameters, capturing
spectral variations and subtle changes in the intensity
proﬁle of the diseased tissues, as compared to their nor-
mal counterparts, are identiﬁed in the wavelet domain.
Based on earlier investigations and the present study of
tissue phantoms, the physical origin of these distinguish-
ing parameters can be primarily ascribed to the changes
in the concentration of porphyrins and the density of cel-
lular organelles present in tumors [14, 25].

In total, 28 breast cancer tissue samples were stud-
ied; out of these, 23 samples came with their normal
counterparts. The tissue samples were excited by 488nm
wavelength polarized light and the parallel and perpen-
dicularly polarized ﬂuorescence light were measured from
500 to 700 nm. Diﬀerences of parallel and perpendicu-
lar components of ﬂuorescence intensity (I
− I⊥) versus
k
wavelength proﬁles for all the tissue samples were ana-
lyzed by Haar wavelets [26].

We have identiﬁed three independent parameters, de-
rived from the coeﬃcients in the transform domain,
which diﬀerentiate cancer and normal tissues quite ac-
curately. The ﬁrst parameter is the local maxima in
the third quarter of the fourth level low-pass coeﬃcients.
As will be elaborated later, this feature owes its origin
to porphyrin emission [17, 25]. The other two param-
eters are based on wavelet high-pass coeﬃcients, repre-
senting both global and characteristic local variations of
the ﬂuorescence spectra.
In the domain of these three
parameters, all the malignant and normal tissues studied
here could be accurately diﬀerentiated. The ﬁve unpaired
samples were used as checks for the consistency of two of
the chosen parameters, since one of the parameters is a
ratio, which involves both tissue types. Studies on tissue
phantoms, corroborating the above choice of parameters
and the inferences about the aforementioned biochemical

components of the ﬂuorescence spectra for tumor and normal
tissues. Inset shows the corresponding fourth level low-pass
coeﬃcients.

changes in the tissues are presented below for compari-
son.

In the fourth level low-pass coeﬃcients, the one orig-
inating from the ﬂuorescence signals around 630 nm of
the original data is found to be considerably higher in
cancer tissues as compared to the corresponding normal
ones. This is possibly due to the presence of more por-
phyrin as well as scattering agents. A particularly noisy
− I⊥) from cancer and normal
ﬂuorescence data of (I
k
human breast tissues does not reveal signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences (Fig.1). However, the low-pass wavelet coeﬃcients
of the same data (Fig.1, inset) capture these diﬀerences
quite remarkably, highlighting the usefulness of wavelet
analysis.

The local maxima at third quarter of fourth level low-
pass coeﬃcients of cancer samples are more than 0.1
while those of normal tissues are less than 0.1, with a
It
sensitivity of 100% and speciﬁcity of 83% (Fig. 2).
should be noted here that the values for normal tis-
sues which are more than 0.1 still show lower values
than the corresponding tumors, consistent with all the
other samples. Thus intra-patient diagnosis gives a clear
distinction between cancer and normal tissues. Varia-
tions in inter-patient diagnosis may be due to the fact
that, the growth of tumor depends on genetic (major
genes, modiﬁer genes) and non-genetic factors (birth,
age, weight/diet, exercise, environmental exposures, etc)
[4].

An important observation here is that the 630 nm band
gets emphasized only in the fourth level low-pass coeﬃ-
cients. This band is masked by other noisy signals at the
third level and is averaged out at the ﬁfth level (Fig. 3).
In cases where the fourth level does not highlight this
band, the previous level does.

FAD and porphyrins are the major ﬂuorophores that
ﬂuoresce in the visible wavelength regime, with peak in-
tensities at 530 and 630 nm respectively. These ﬂuo-
rophores are considered as contrast agents for cancer de-

tection [6, 10, 17]. It has been suggested that deﬁciency
in ferrochelatase, the enzyme required for conversion of
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) to heme, in tumors results in
accumulation of PpIX in these tissues relative to the nor-
mal ones (10)[10]. Such accumulation changes the rela-
tive concentration of these ﬂuorophores thus altering the

ﬂuorescence spectra signiﬁcantly, which in turn changes
the peak heights of the emission bands of the two ﬂuo-
rophores. The scattering centers are known to enhance
the ﬂuorescence intensity [27]. Thus the large size of cell
suspensions, higher density of cells and accumulation of
more porphyrin in tumors all contribute to a small peak
at 630 nm wavelength region.

Studies of tissue models show that the 630 nm band
gets enhanced at the fourth level low-pass coeﬃcients of
phantoms, with an increase in the scatterer concentra-
tions (Fig. 4a) as well as with increase in porphyrin con-
centrations (Fig. 4b). A small peak around 630 nm is
clearly visible at suitable concentrations. Signiﬁcantly, in
these tissue phantoms too, the third and ﬁfth level low-
passes do not highlight the 630 nm band, as observed in
tissue samples.

The power spectra at diﬀerent levels are deﬁned as the
sum of the square of high-pass coeﬃcients at those levels.
Normalization of the power spectra is done by dividing
it by the sum of the square of intensities at all the wave-
lengths. In twenty two paired samples, it was found that
the tumors have lower power at the third level as com-

pared to their normal counterparts with a sensitivity of
96%.

It was also found that, in case of the cancer tissues,
the third wavelet coeﬃcient at the ﬁfth level (originating
from the ﬂuorescence emission at 580 to 596 nm region
in the original spectrum), is less negative than those of
the normal ones. This implies that the normal tissue
ﬂuorescence spectra fall more sharply than those of the
cancer tissues. Out of 28 cancer samples, which includes
23 paired and 5 unpaired tissues, 21 samples have third
coeﬃcients less than -0.31; out of 23 normal tissue sam-
ples, 14 samples have third coeﬃcients more than -0.31.
However, intra-patient diagnosis by high-pass coeﬃcients
shows that the third coeﬃcient, for 17 out of 23 paired
samples of normal tissues, is more than that of cancer-
ous ones. Hence, for this coeﬃcient, the cancer to normal
ratio is less than one, with a sensitivity of 74%.

It may be noted that the above-mentioned three pa-
rameters also distinguish tumors of diﬀerent grades. It is
found that for grades I and II cancerous tissues the values
of the local low-pass maxima at the third quadrant are
less than 0.2, but more than 0.2 in the grade III cancers,
with a sensitivity of 75%. At third level, the power ratio
is less than 0.3 for grade I and grade II cancers and is
between 0.3 to 0.8 for grade III cancers.

In conclusion, the systematic separation of variations
at diﬀerent wavelength scales and the broad spectral fea-
tures in the wavelet domain pinpoints several quantiﬁ-
able parameters to distinguish cancer and normal tissues.
These distinguishable features are related with the bio-
chemical and morphological changes, as is also evident
from the phantom study. The fact that these character-
istic signatures are based on higher level wavelet coeﬃ-
cients make them robust and less susceptible to exper-
imental and statistical uncertainties. The need for the
early identiﬁcation and constant monitoring of breast
cancer for a large population makes this method emi-
nently suitable since the same can be automated.

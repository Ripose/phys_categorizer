Abstract. We describe a new data collection scheme for optical diﬀusion tomography
in which plane wave illumination is combined with multiple projections in the slab
imaging geometry. Multiple projection measurements are performed by rotating
the slab around the sample. The advantage of the proposed method is that the
measured data can be much more easily ﬁtted into the dynamic range of most
commonly used detectors. At the same time, multiple projections improve image
quality by mutually interchanging the depth and transverse directions, and the scanned
(detection) and integrated (illumination) surfaces.
Inversion methods are derived
for image reconstructions with extremely large data sets. Numerical simulations are
performed for ﬁxed and rotated slabs.

1. Introduction

Tomographic imaging with diﬀuse light, often referred to as optical diﬀusion tomography
(ODT), is a novel biomedical imaging modality [1, 2]. Although ODT was introduced
more than a decade ago, eﬀorts to bring it into the clinical environment are hampered
by relatively low quality and spatial resolution of images. Therefore, optimization of
image reconstruction algorithms for high-resolution ODT is of fundamental importance.
In this paper we study the image reconstruction problem of ODT by combining three
novel approaches. First, we employ analytic image reconstruction methods which allows
the utilization of extremely large data sets [3, 4]. Second, we make use of multiple
projections [5]. Here by multiple projections we mean multiple orientations of the
measurement apparatus with respect to the medium. Finally, we utilize the recently
proposed plane wave illumination scheme [6]. Each of these methods provides an
advantage which is not lost when the techniques are combined. We begin by brieﬂy
reviewing the approaches to ODT imaging mentioned above. Note that throughout this
paper we consider the slab imaging geometry which is often used in mammography and
small-animal imaging [7,8]. In order to obtain multiple projection measurements, a pair
of parallel plates are rotated around the medium to be imaged which is assumed to be
stationary and unperturbed.

There is a direct relationship between the spatial resolution of images and the
number of data points used for reconstruction [3].
Indeed, the reconstruction of an
image with N voxels, in principle, requires at least N measurements. In practice, the
ill-posedness of the image reconstruction problem and the presence of noise require that
this number be larger than N. Measurements with up to 1010 data points are feasible
with CCD camera-based instruments. However, many previous studies of the image
reconstruction problem in ODT have been limited to relatively small data sets (e.g., 256
data points in Ref. [9], 900 data points in Ref. [10]). This can be explained by the high
computational complexity of algebraic image reconstruction algorithms which scales as
O(N 3). To ameliorate this diﬃculty, we have recently introduced a family of analytic
image reconstruction algorithms that can utilize extremely large data sets [11–15]. These
methods allow a dramatic reduction in computational complexity which, in turn, leads
to a signiﬁcant improvement of spatial resolution of images. However, these methods
have certain limitations.

First, the data collection method described in Ref. [14] requires that measurements
are taken for source-detector pairs separated by a distance which is much larger than
the slab thickness. In practice, such measurements are technically diﬃcult to perform.
Reduction of the required dynamic range of the detectors can be achieved by using plane
wave illumination [6]. Note that due to the general theoretical reciprocity of sources
and detectors, plane wave illumination and scanned detection is equivalent to integrated
detection and scanned narrow beam illumination. However, in a practical situation, the
diﬀerent nature of illuminating and detecting devices must be taken into account. For
the sake of deﬁnitiveness, we consider below plane wave illumination and combine it

with analytic image reconstruction methods. Note that plane wave illumination requires
time- or frequency-resolved measurements. However, it can be seen that the number of
degrees of freedom in the data is still insuﬃcient for unique, simultaneous reconstruction
of the absorption and diﬀusion (or reduced scattering) coeﬃcients. This situation is
similar to the nonuniqueness demonstrated in Ref. [16]. Therefore, we focus here on
the reconstruction of absorbing inhomogeneities assuming that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
of the medium is constant. Reconstruction of purely absorbing inhomogeneities have
been employed,
in breast imaging [17–20] or blood oxygenation level
imaging [21, 22].

for example,

Second, it was shown in Ref. [3] that in the slab imaging geometry the depth
resolution (in the direction perpendicular to the slab) is fundamentally diﬀerent from
the transverse resolution (in the direction parallel to the slab surface). The depth
resolution is much more sensitive to noise and the point-spread functions (PSFs) in the
depth direction strongly depend on the location of the inhomogeneity. This results in
image artifacts. In general, the non-uniformity of the PSF can be a serious problem
if more than one inhomogeneity is present. To correct this situation, we have recently
proposed multi-projection image reconstruction methods [5, 15]. Multiple projections
render the depth and transverse directions mutually interchangeable. As a result, the
PSF becomes more uniform and less position-dependent, and also more sharply peaked.
Note that multiple projections have been used in X-ray imaging for some time. However,
an important diﬀerence between ODT and X-ray computed tomography is that, in the
ﬁrst case, tomographic imaging is possible in principle with a single projection while
in the second case it is not. Perhaps, due to this fact, multiple projections in optical
tomography have not been investigated until recently, except for the case of ballistic
propagation without scattering (e.g. [23]), or in conjunction with a modiﬁed version
of X-ray backprojection tomography with phenomenological corrections introduced to
compensate for scattering [24, 25]. In Ref. [15] we have developed a general theoretical
formalism for inverting measurements obtained from multiple projections. In Ref. [5]
image reconstruction with two orthogonal projections was numerically implemented.

In this paper we implement the more general image reconstruction algorithm of
Ref. [15] for treatment of more than two projections in conjunction with plane wave
illumination. Note that the plane wave illumination is advantageous when measurement
are limited by the dynamic range of detectors. If the dynamic range is not an important
experimental factor, the traditional measurement scheme with point sources and point
detectors is expected to provide superior image quality. We combine the advantageous
features of these two approaches with the computational eﬃciency of the analytic image
reconstruction methods.

2. Theory

2.1. Single projection

We assume that propagation of multiply-scattered light in tissue is described by the
diﬀusion equation. In addition, we will work in the frequency domain with the sources
harmonically modulated at the frequency ω and detectors which yield the oscillatory
part of transmitted intensity. Then the density of electromagnetic energy in the medium
u(r) obeys the diﬀusion equation

D0∇2u(r) + [α(r)

iω]u(r) = S(r) ,

−

−

where α(r) is the position dependent absorption coeﬃcients, S(r) is the source function
and the D0 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

Consider a slab of thickness L with the plane of incidence located at x =

L/2 and
the detection plane at x = L/2. The medium is located in the region
L/2 < x < L/2.
If point-like sources and detectors are used (typically, thin optical ﬁbers), the data can
be expressed as a function φ(ω, ρs, ρd), where ρs and ρd are two-dimensional vectors
specifying the location of the sources and detectors, respectively, on the slab surfaces.
Using the ﬁrst Born approximation, we linearize the forward model by decomposing
the absorption function α(r) into a constant background and a small ﬂuctuating part,
α(r) = α0+δα(r). We seek to reconstruct the values of δα(r) from the data φ(ω, ρs, ρd).
The usual mathematical formulation of the ODT inverse problem is based on the integral
equation [26]

−

φ(ω, ρs, ρd) =

Γ(ω, ρs, ρd; r)δα(r)d3r ,

ρ is the transverse part of the vector r (r = (x, ρ)) and the form of κ(ω, qs, qd; x) is
determined from the boundary conditions on the surfaces of the slab and the expression
which relates the measurable intensity to the energy density u(r). The derivation of
(2),(3) and explicit expressions for κ are given in Ref. [3]. Note that the general form
of (2),(3) follows from the symmetry of the problem and is independent of the diﬀusion
approximation.

Next, we introduce the plane wave illumination scheme.

Instead of using point
sources located at points ρs, we illuminate the slab with a normally incident wide
homogeneous beam of suﬃciently large diameter (compared to transverse dimensions of
the slab). At the same time we utilize point detectors. This ensures that the new data

has the same number of degrees of freedom as the unknown δα(r) (two spatial directions

2.2. Multiple projections

We now consider inclusion of multiple projections. Let the sources and detectors be
rotated around the sample as illustrated in Fig. 1. We assume that the rotations do not
disturb the medium inside the cylinder √x2 + y2 < L/2 and that the unknown function
δα vanishes outside the same region. The space inside the slab but outside the above
cylindrical region is assumed to have the background values of the coeﬃcients α0 and D0.
Experimentally, this can be implemented, for example, by rotating an imaging apparatus
around a sample suspended in matching ﬂuid. We introduce cylindrical coordinates
r = (R, z, ϕ) with the z-axis being the axis of rotation. If the data are measured for

Note that in (16) we have explicitly included the dependence of the data function on the
angle of orientation θ. The functions a(ω, q, m; R) and
can be,
in general, expressed in terms of modiﬁed Bessel functions. The corresponding integrals
(13) and (15) are calculated in the Appendix for the case of purely absorbing boundaries.
A few comments on the reconstruction formula (11) are necessary. First, there is
an apparent diﬀerence between the variables uz, n and uy, ω. The ﬁrst set of variables
correspond (after Fourier transformation of the data) to the variables z, θ. These are
the variables with respect to which the unperturbed medium is translationally invariant,
and they can be referred to as “external” variables. The variables ω, uy are “internal”
variables: they do not correspond to any translational invariance of the system. Second,
the reconstruction algorithm (16) involves integration over the continuous variables
uy and u′
y and inversion of the operator M(uz, n) whose matrix elements depend on
continuous indices. However, if the variables uy, u′
y are discretized and the corresponding
integration in (16) is replaced by a summation, then M(uz, n) becomes a discrete matrix.
The resulting reconstruction formula is no longer an SVD pseudo-inverse on the whole
set of data ψ(ω, ρd, θ). However, it is a pseudo-inverse solution on the set of the Fourier-
transformed data ˜ψ(ω, uy, uz, θ) where uy takes only discrete values. Third, it can
be veriﬁed that in the case Nθ = 1, the reconstruction formula (16) reduces to (6).
Fourth, we note that the number of degrees of freedom in the data-function ˜ψ is four
(ω, uy, uz and n). Thus, when the number of rotations is large, it is suﬃcient to use
only one or a few values of the variable uy, in which case the inverse problem is still well
It can be argued that the reconstruction algorithm is then “numerical”
determined.
in one dimension and “analytic” in two.
However, when only a small number of
§
projections is taken, we must use a relatively large number of discrete values of uy. By
doing so, we increase the size of the matrix M whose SVD must be found numerically.
The inverse solution (11) is then “numerical” in two dimensions and “analytic” in one.
A similar algorithm (numerical in two dimensions and analytic in one dimension) was
proposed and implemented in [5], where the image reconstruction area was rectangular
rather than cylindrical, but only two orthogonal projections were allowed. In contrast,
the full potential of the image reconstruction algorithm proposed here is realized when
Nθ is large.

3. Numerical Results

3.1. Single projection

We have implemented the proposed reconstruction algorithm using computer-generated
data and the following parameters: the slab thickness was chosen to be the same as the
D0/α0 (for most biological tissues, this corresponds to
cw diﬀuse wavelength, L = 2π

If the number of rotations and the number of discrete values of uy are both large, it should be possible
§
to recover the absorption and scattering coeﬃcients uniquely and simultaneously. This theoretical
possibility is not discussed in this paper.

The results of reconstructions are shown in Fig. 2. The density plots represent
tomographic slices of the medium drawn at diﬀerent depths d (the distance from the
plane of scanned detection) parallel to the slab surfaces. The depth of the absorbing
inhomogeneity, d0, was in each case equal to d; thus the slices represent the depth-
dependent y
z PSFs. Each density plot has a linear color scale and is normalized
to its own maximum. As expected, the PSFs become broader when the point absorber
approaches the illuminated plane. The last two panels (a,b) show the PSFs in the depth
direction (x) for point absorbers located at d0 = 0.25L, d0 = 0.5L and d0 = 0.75L.

Note that the approximate half-widths of these curves are 0.06L, 0.09L and 0.09L,
respectively.

The analysis of Fig. 2 suggests that the PSFs are depth-dependent. Moreover, the
PSFs have diﬀerent integral weights. Thus, the point absorbers which are closer to the
plane of scanned detection result in higher peaks in the reconstructed images. The width
of the PSFs also depends on depth of the point absorber. This potentially constitutes
a serious problem for three dimensional tomographic imaging.

3.2. Multiple projections

We have implemented numerically the multi-projection image reconstruction formula
(11). Note that in the multi-projection case there are two choices for graphically
In one case, the slices are perpendicular to the

axis of rotation. The image then is reconstructed in a circle. This choice is convenient
for studying the radial and angular resolutions. Another possibility is to construct
cylindrical slices R = Rimage = const, and map them onto rectangles. The image is then
reconstructed in the rectangular area 2πRimage
zmin), where zmax and zmin are
the maximum and minimum values of z, chosen arbitrarily.
We start with the discussion of circular slices.

The results of numerical
implementation of the reconstruction formula (16) are shown in Fig. 3 for four diﬀerent
orientations of the slab, namely θ = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2. We have used 23 equally spaced
π/h to π/h and 15 equally spaced modulation frequencies

ranging from 0 to 10α0; otherwise, the parameters are the same as in Fig. 2. The
inhomogeneity was located as speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legend. The white spots in the
density plots illustrate the depth PSFs. The graphs (a,b) show the same PSFs in a more
quantitative way by plotting δα along the diameter of the cylinder which intersects all
three inhomogeneities.

As expected, using four diﬀerent projections improves the image quality by
interchanging the source and detector planes, and the depth and transverse directions.
Moreover, using more projections than four does not change the results substantially,
as is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. However, when a large number of projections is taken,
the inverse problem becomes well determined even when a relatively small number
of “internal” degrees of freedom uy is used. This makes the reconstruction formulae
computationally eﬃcient. Thus, the computation time required for producing data for
Fig. 5 is more than an order of magnitude less than that for Fig. 3, yet the image quality
is similar. We have veriﬁed that three discrete values of uy is also suﬃcient for Nθ = 20
(taking a single value uy = 0 results in a slight decrease in image quality; data not
shown).

Although the images shown in Figs. 3-5 are similar, the best image quality is, in
fact, attained in Fig. 4. Here the approximate half-widths of the PSF in the R direction
are 0.05L for the inhomogeneity located at R0 = 0, 0.04L for the inhomogeneity at
R0 = 0.25L, ϕ0 = 0; and 0.03L for the inhomogeneity at R0 = 0.375L, ϕ0 = π. These

values should be compared to the respective values given in the discussion of Fig. 2.
In particular, the inhomogeneity located at h0 = 0.5L in Fig. 2 corresponds to the
inhomogeneity at R0 = 0 in Figs. 3-5 and is the most “diﬃcult” to reconstruct since it
is located deep inside the medium. It can be seen that the PSF half-width in the image
of this particular inhomogeneity is reduced by approximately the factor of 2 due to the
use of multiple projections. In addition, the relative heights of the maxima of the PSFs
in Fig. 3-5 do not diﬀer as much as in Fig. 2. This is expected to reduce image artifacts.
Now we consider the cylindrical slices. From the computational point of view, the
use of cylindrical slices is a more natural way to display reconstructed images. This
is evident from the inversion formulae (11),(12). Indeed, it can be seen that when the
reconstructed image is rasterized so that the variables z and ϕ are placed on lattices with
steps h and 2π/Nθ, respectively, the function P (ω, u, n; R, z, ϕ) becomes independent
of z and ϕ. Then the dependence of reconstructed images on these two variables is only
due to the exponent in the integral (11) and the reconstruction formula, with respect
to these two variables, is reduced to a Fourier transform. In Fig. 6 we have used three
discrete values of uy with 40 diﬀerent projections and slices are drawn as described in
the ﬁgure caption. Fig. 6(a) illustrates image reconstruction with noiseless data. It can
be directly compared to slices shown in Fig. 2. To demonstrate the stability of image
reconstruction, we have added random Gaussian noise to the data function at the level
of 1% of the average absolute value of the data. The result is shown in Fig. 6(b). As
is well known, inclusion of noise tends to decrease spatial resolution.
It can be seen
that this eﬀect is stronger for inhomogeneities that are deeper inside the medium. We
have demonstrated earlier that multi-projection imaging is more stable in the presence
of noise than the single projection technique [5].

4. Summary

In summary, we have presented a new experimental modality and computationally
eﬃcient image reconstruction algorithms for optical diﬀusion tomography employing
plane wave illumination with multiple projections. Note that due to reciprocity, plane
wave illumination and scanned detection is equivalent to illumination by a scanned
narrow beam and integrated detection (e.g., with the use of time-resolved CCD camera).
The following speciﬁc conclusions can be drawn

•

•

Use of plane wave illumination may be simpler experimentally than the
traditional approach in which point-like sources and detectors are scanned because
measurements with a much smaller dynamic range are required.

In a single projection experiment, the image quality is relatively good when the
point absorber is close to the scanned surface and deteriorates as it approaches the
plane of illumination. This situation should be contrasted with the traditional
point source/point detector modality [14], where the image quality is low
for inhomogeneities located in the center of a slab and improves when the

at radial depths R0 as indicated. The cylindrical surfaces with radii R = R0 (directly
intersecting the inhomogeneity) are shown as projections onto a plane; the length of
the vertical side of each rectangle is equal to L and of the horizontal side to 2πR.
Forty projections, 25 modulation frequencies and 9 discrete values of uy are used for
reconstruction.

inhomogeneity approaches either of the imaging surfaces. For a point inhomogeneity
in the center of a slab, the image quality is slightly better for the traditional (point
source/point detector) modality (cf. [14]).

Rotating the slab around the sample removes many of the deﬁciencies of the plane
wave illumination scheme by interchanging the scanned and integrated detection
surfaces and depth and transverse directions. A minimum of four projections is
required for such an interchange.

When only four rotations are used, a large number of discrete values of the
“internal” variable uy must be utilized in the reconstruction. Alternatively, a large
number of projections can be used with a small number of discrete values of uy.
The second approach is much more computationally eﬃcient but requires more
complicated measurements. The quality of images is similar in both cases.

The plane wave illumination approach allows one to signiﬁcantly simplify
reconstruction formulae, both in single- and multiple-projection imaging.

If only small number of projections is used (two or four) an alternative approach
may be used, which is purely numerical in two dimensions and analytic in one
dimension [5]. For a large number of projections, the algorithm reported here is
computationally more eﬃcient.

Appendix: Calculation of the functions a(ω, q, m; R) and M1(qz, m).

The function a(ω, q, m; R) is deﬁned by (13). To evaluate the integral, we must specify
the function κ(ω, 0, q; x). Explicit expressions for κ are given in [3] for general boundary
conditions. In this paper we consider absorbing boundaries for which κ is given by the
expression

κ(ω, 0, q; x) =

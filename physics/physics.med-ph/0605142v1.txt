A generalized spatiotemporal covariance model
for stationary background in analysis of MEG data

Abstract— Using a noise covariance model based on a single
Kronecker product of spatial and temporal covariance in the
spatiotemporal analysis of MEG data was demonstrated to
provide improvement in the results over that of the commonly
used diagonal noise covariance model. In this paper we present
a model that is a generalization of all of the above models. It
describes models based on a single Kronecker product of spatial
and temporal covariance as well as more complicated multi-
pair models together with any intermediate form expressed as
a sum of Kronecker products of spatial component matrices
of reduced rank and their corresponding temporal covariance
matrices. The model provides a framework for controlling the
tradeoff between the described complexity of the background
and computational demand for the analysis using this model.
Ways to estimate the value of the parameter controlling this
tradeoff are also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Given that MEG/EEG is measured in M trials, on L
sensors and in C time samples, let Em be the L by C single
trial noise matrix at trial m. And to simplify our notation
further we assume that the background in Em is zero-mean.
In this case, the sample spatiotemporal covariance matrix of
dimension N = LC for the averaged over trials noise is

Cs =

M

M − 1

vec(Em)vec(Em)T ,

m=1

where vec(E) is all the columns of E stacked in a vector.
Due to the tremendously large number of parameters
(O(L2C2)) compared to the relative sparsity of background
data typically available many attempts to model the co-
variance has been made. In order to be useful for source
analysis a model of spatiotemporal covariance should capture
the structure of the background with as few parameters as
possible. Finally to be useful the model should be invertible,
so it can be used in a likelihood formulation.

To capture the structure in the brain background signal
we note that there is evidence that the background activity
of the brain has a stationary spatial distribution over the
time of interest in the neuroscientiﬁc experiments [6]. This

observation provides for the current approach in exploratory
fMRI analysis to represent four dimensional spatiotemporal
data as a two dimensional matrix X, which is decomposed
into a sum of Kronecker products contaminated by normal
noise [1]:

X =

ar ⊗ br + E.

(2)

Relying on such evidence, we can make assumptions
about the background activity in the brain in the MEG
(magnetoencephalography) measurements:

1) The measured background is a superposition of R
spatially ﬁxed sources with independent temporal be-
havior.

2) Each spatial source produces correlated Gaussian

noise.

These are the basis for modeling spatiotemporal covari-
ance adopted in this work. The ﬁnal goal is to ﬁnd spatial
components according to a justiﬁed criteria and then estimate
respective temporal covariances for each component. For L
sensors performing the measurement we can extract at most
L spatial components from the measured background, which
gives us the starting form for the spatiotemporal covariance
matrix:

T l ⊗ S l,

where S l = vlvT

is a spatial component represented as a

In what follows we demonstrate how existing spatiotem-
poral covariance models based on the Kronecker product can
be described in the proposed framework. This includes the
models based on one Kronecker product suggested in [2],
[3] and on a series of Kronecker products introduced by
us [4]. Finally we extend the framework by making it span
the range of models between one pair Kronecker models and
L component models.

II. ONE-PAIR KRONECKER PRODUCT

In [2] was proposed a model that casts spatiotemporal

covariance in the form that uses the Kronecker product:

COV ≈ T ⊗ S.

(4)

Temporal covariance is a C × C matrix T and spatial
covariance is a L × L matrix S, where C is the number
of time samples and L is the number of sensors.

An important feature of this model is its computationally
fast inverse calculation (T⊗S)−1 = T−1⊗S−1. This feature

is required of all covariance models to make them useful in
the analysis. All models presented in this paper are invertible
and manageable within reasonable time.

Since the background is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution the model can be estimated in the maximum
likelihood framework as in [2].

Here M is the number of available L × C spatiotemporal

In essence, the main assumption of the one-pair Kronecker
product model is that all spatial components of the back-
ground have one and the same temporal covariance structure.
To demonstrate the validity of this statement we perform
spectral decomposition of the spatial covariance:

T ⊗

σlS l,

L

l=1

(6)

where S l = vlvT
is an orthonormal basis component repre-
l
sented as a singular matrix. Using the identity A⊗(B+C) =
A ⊗ B + A ⊗ C, the expression (6) can be represented as:

T ⊗ σlS l =

σlT ⊗ S l.

(7)

L

l=1
X

L

l=1
X

The Left Hand Side of the equation (7) makes it obvious that
each spatial component has the same temporal covariance.
The contribution of each temporal covariance is weighted
by the variance of the corresponding orthonormal spatial
component, as seen from the Right Hand Side of (7). When
we set σlT = T l we see how our general model from (3)
subsumes the one pair model.

A parameterized model of the same form as in (4) was
introduced in order to achieve a further reduction in the
number of parameters [3]. This model is also a special case
of (7). To see that it is enough to follow the same logic as
we just did for the unparameterized model.

Both models have the form as in (3) and any set of
orthogonal or independent components can be used. As
demonstrated in [5] estimation of orthogonal components
through singular value decomposition and of independent
components through an independent component analysis
algorithm work well.

For given orthogonal components S l = vlvT

l with vl being
a column of an orthogonal matrix V , Maximal Likelihood
estimate of the model is:

For given independent components Rl = wlwT

being a row of a full rank matrix W −1, Maximal Likelihood
estimate of the model is:

COV ≈ ^COV ≡

T l =

These models are more general than the model of Sec-
tion II and the independent basis multi-pair model of (9)
is the most general in terms of having the largest number
of degrees of freedom. This increased complexity brings
advantages in being able to more accurately model
the
complex empirical noise covariance, which lead to improved
source localization performance as demonstrated in [5].
Furthermore, inversion is computationally efﬁcient due to the
built in structure. For the orthogonal basis model:

III. MULTI-PAIR MODELS

Details of the derivation can be found in [5].

In a more realistic case it is easy to picture a situation
where several noise generators belonging to separate spatial
components also have different temporal structures.

Two models covering such case were introduces in [5]
one in which spatial components S l are components of an
orthonormal basis and the other with spatial components
from an independent basis. The following is assumed:

1) Spatiotemporal noise is generated by L spatially or-
thogonal (or independent) generators which do not
change their location during the period of interest.

2) Each spatial component

is uncorrelated with other

3) Measured signal has a Gaussian distribution with zero

components.

IV. GENERALIZED MULTI-PAIR MODEL

Even though the models in Section III are more descriptive
and yield better results than single-pair models, the problem
with them is the computational complexity of each iteration
in the analysis where the likelihood needs to be computed.
The negative log-likelihood function in the case of using a
multipair model looks like:

L

l=1
X

(Eb − EM)T Sl(Eb − EM)T −1

.

(12)

Here Eb and EM are L × C matrices of spatiotemporal
measurements and the current prediction made by the model,
respectively. Calculation of (12) takes O(L(L2C + LC2 +

C3)) operations and it is L times bigger than for one-pair
models.

Yet, notice that multi-pair models utilize all spatial com-
ponents which in the case of the orthogonal basis model
also includes those components that have small singular
values. Without loss of generality we consider ﬁrst only the
orthogonal basis multi-pair model. Separating the ﬁrst r ≤ L
most signiﬁcant singular values, the model can be expressed
as

T l ⊗ S l +

T k ⊗ S k.

(13)

r

l=1
X

L

k=r+1
X

The second term in expression (13) contains small vari-
ance relative to the ﬁrst one. Conventional dimensionality
reduction techniques like PCA would eliminate this term
from further consideration. Though this would make the
model smaller in terms of storage requirements it will at the
same time render it useless in the analysis. The inversion
following the lines of (10) would become impossible. At
the same time if we set temporal covariance of all spatial
components with small singular values to be the same as it
is assumed in the one-pair model (7) we obtain the following
expression:

r

l=1
X

L

k=r+1
X

Expression (14) is a general form describing spatiotem-
poral covariance models based on the assumption that the
brain has stationary spatial distribution of the background
activity over the time of interest [6]. It can describe the one-
pair model when r is set to zero and multi-pair models when
r = L.

A feature absolutely required from this model is that
it be invertible. Otherwise, the model cannot be used in
the Likelihood function (12) for source localization. Indeed,
this model has a computationally manageable inverse with
calculation time depending on r and ranging between the
times for the one-pair model and the multi-pair models. For
the orthogonal basis multi-pair model the inverse is:

T −1

l ⊗ Sl + T −1 ⊗

To prove this claim it sufﬁces to show that:

The proof proceeds in the similar fashion as for the orthog-
onal basis model.

Computational efﬁciency of this new generalized spa-
tiotemporal covariance model is now a function of r and
not ﬁxed to the number of sensors, as in the case of models
from Section III. Here again, without
loss of generality
we demonstrate results using the orthogonal basis model.

The computational complexity of this calculation is O((r +
1)(L2C +LC2+C3)) and is ﬂexible since it is parameterized
by r. It can be as large as the one of (12) when the back-
ground is diverse enough to need a complex representation
and can be as small as that of the one-pair model.

The generalized orthogonal basis model from (14) can
be estimated in a relatively straightforward manner based
on the nature of PCA. The number of single Kronecker
product pairs of our model r + 1 is obtained by choosing
the most signiﬁcant components provided by singular value
decomposition. This is a well justiﬁed approach and it fol-
lows the conventional method of dimensionality reduction in
PCA. After that the model can be estimated in the Maximal
Likelihood framework. Before proceeding with its derivation
we need to calculate the determinant of (14). It can be found

from the determinant of the orthogonal basis multipair model
derived in [5]:

Together with the equation (8) we can estimate the gen-
eralized model as a sum of r Kronecker products of rank
one spatial component matrices with their corresponding
temporal covariance matrices plus a Kronecker product of
a spatial component matrix of rank J with its corresponding
temporal covariance matrix.

This approach will not work for the independent basis
model. There are no singular values that can be used for

thresholding. However, we can use the variance of the
data projected into each independent spatial component to
perform thresholding based on its value. Then a similar
Maximal Likelihood estimation as in (9) can be used for
the generalized independent basis model. This would add
asymmetry to the way these two models are estimated.

Another possible approach can be based on observations
made in [4]. Many temporal covariances of different spatial
components were found to be similar. By discovering r
clusters of similar temporal covariances we can obtain r
Kronecker products of the generalized multi-pair model. This
approach is applicable both for orthogonal and independent
basis models. A similarity criterion could be developed for
that case, such that it provides clustering of components in
a manner that balances optimizing source localization with
reducing computational time. In this second approach, the
resulting model will be different from the one obtained by
thresholding of signiﬁcant components. The model is then
described as a sum of Kronecker products of spatial compo-
nent matrices of incomplete rank and their corresponding
temporal covariances. The difference is that
there is no
requirement of having rank one component matrices and
having only one spatial component matrix of a bigger rank
as in (14).

It is to be determined which of these two approaches
shows better localization performance. In future work we
plan to answer this question and investigate which clustering
algorithm to use for obtaining summands in the second
approach.

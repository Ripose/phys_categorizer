188Re is a β− (Emax = 2.12 MeV) and γ (155 keV) emitter. Since its chemistry is similar to that of the largely
employed tracer, 99m
Tc, molecules of hyaluronic acid (HA) have been labelled with 188Re to produce a target
speciﬁc radiopharmaceutical. The radiolabeled compound, i.v. injected in healthy mice, is able to accumulate into
the liver after a few minutes. To study the eﬀect of metabolic radiotherapy in mice, we have built a small gamma
camera based on a matrix of YAP:Ce crystals, with 0.6×0.6×10 mm3 pixels, read out by a R2486 Hamamatsu
PSPMT. A high-sensitivity 20 mm thick lead parallel-hole collimator, with hole diameter 1.5 mm and septa of
0.18 mm, is placed in front of the YAP matrix. Preliminary results obtained with various phantoms containing
a solution of 188Re and with C57 black mice injected with the 188Re-HA solution are presented. To increase the
space resolution and to obtain two orthogonal projections simultaneously we are building in parallel two new
cameras to be positioned at 90 degrees. They use a CsI(Tl) matrix with 1×1×5 mm3 pixels read out by H8500
Hamamatsu Flat panel PMT.

1. INTRODUCTION

188Re is an attractive therapeutic radioisotope
with broad clinical applications. Oncology appli-
cations range from palliation of metastatic bone
pain to bone marrow ablation and in general to
the use of 188Re labelled therapeutic agents to
target speciﬁc cancerous tissues (see for instance
reference [1]). Other therapeutic applications
comprise the inihibition of restenosis after Per-
cutanueous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty
(PTCA), radiation synovectomy, and intravasal
brachytherapy.
In the ﬁeld of metabolic radio-
therapy 188Re shows several favourable charac-
teristics.
It can be produced carrier free using
a W-Re generator (see for instance reference [2])
and its chemistry is similar to that of 99mTc which
is the most used radioisotope in nuclear medicine
(medical imaging). The 188W parent has a 69 d
half-life, which permits to use the generator for
a relatively long period, the equilibrium between
parent and daughter setting up within about two
days. 188Re decays to 188Os∗ in about 0.7 days via
the emission of a β-ray with a maximum energy
of 2.12 MeV (0.78 MeV average energy), which
In
can be used for destroying cancerous cells.
addition 188Os∗ emits promptly (0.69 ns) a 155
keV γ-ray (15%), which can be used for imaging.
Given the chemical similarity with 99mTc, it can
be linked to molecules of hyaluronic acid (HA)
which have the function of carrying it to speciﬁc
sites in the body, e.g. with the production of
an accumulation and retention of the drug in the
liver [3]. Hence the potential interest for treating
liver cancers. On the other hand the β radiation
could interfere with the labelling process and de-
stroy the molecule used to carry the radioisotope
in the body to the target organ, thus reducing the
therapeutic eﬀect. Two additional points have to
do with the relatively long lifetime and with the
rich photon spectrum of 188Re, which extends to
high energy, compared to the single 140 keV pho-
ton emitted by 99mTc with a half-life of about 6
h. Taking into account the branching ratios (BR)
and the lifetimes, the relative 188Re/99mTc count-
ing rate, for an equal number of µ-moles, is about

9%. This implies that photon detectors devel-
oped for imaging with 99mTc are not necessarily
sensitive enough. The usual thickness of a low-
energy Pb collimator, say 20 mm, will be almost
transparent to 188Re photon lines at 300 keV or
higher energies, even with BRs depressed by a fac-
tor of ten or more, producing background counts
which blur the image and worsen the spatial res-
olution. To study the eﬀect of metabolic radio-
therapy in mice, we have therefore built a new
small high-sensitivity γ-camera, following the ex-
perience with the YAP-camera [4][5][6], which is
used routinely to image small animals (mice) with
99mTc-HA at the Laboratori Nazionali di Leg-
naro, Italy (e.g. [7][8]).

2. THE GAMMA CAMERA

The gamma camera is based on a matrix of yt-
trium aluminium perovskite doped with cerium
(YAP:Ce or YAlO3:Ce) crystals [9], with friendly
mechanical properties (no igroscopicity), fast re-
sponse (∼25 ns decay time), high density (5.37
g/cm3) and good X- and γ-ray absorption. There
are 66×66 pixels, each 0.6×0.6×10 mm3, covering
a ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 40×40 mm2. The pixels
are covered laterally by a special 5 µm thick re-
ﬂective coating which provides also the optical
separation between neighboring elements. The
scintillator is read out by a R2486 Hamamatsu
PositionSensitivePMT [10] with a 76 mm diame-
ter photocathode. The anode consists of 16 plus
16 wires crossing at 90o and connected by two
resistive chains, deﬁning the x and y directions.
The wires deﬁne an active area with a diameter
of about 50 mm. A 20 mm thick lead parallel
hexagonal-hole collimator [11], with hole diame-
ter 1.5 mm and septa of 0.18 mm, is placed in
front of the YAP matrix. The detector is trig-
gered using the last dynode and the ends of the x
and y resistive chains (x1, x2, y1, y2) are ampli-
ﬁed, stretched and read out by a PC using a PCI
6023E card [12]. The coordinates of the photon
impact point are then reconstructed by charge di-
vision,

x = (x1 − x2)/(x1 + x2)

and similarly for y.

keV shoulder is also visible; 137Cs instead pro-
duces a broad shoulder at about half of the pho-
ton energy. Using appropriate energy cuts the
three images can be separated. The intrinsic spa-
tial resolution of the system is quite good, since
individual collimator holes can be clearly seen in
Fig. 3. The resolution however is worsened in
practice by the small thickness of the septa rela-
tive to the hole diameter of the present collima-
tors, making them partially transparent to radi-
ation, so the actual eﬀective resolution is ∆x ∼ 3
mm FWHM at 122 keV.

3. CALIBRATIONS

The energy response of the detector to a spa-
tially uniform source (ﬂat ﬁeld) of 99mTc 140 keV
photons prior to energy equalization has been de-
termined using a solution containing 99mTc which
covered the whole FOV and was located a few
centimeters in front of the collimator surface. The
xy has been arbitrarily divided in pixels and the
average energy computed in each pixel. The cor-
rections to the measured energy extracted from
this calibration are shown in Fig. 1 and have
been used in the following. As shown below
with the 188Re spectrum, these corrections im-
prove the energy resolution of the detector. Apart
from the energy equalization, no other correction
has been applied. With 99mTc the sensitivity of
the gamma camera is found to be ∼2×10−4 or
∼7×103 cps/mCi, which agrees roughly with cal-
culations.

Pointlike 241Am (60 keV photons), 57Co (∼122
keV photons) and 137Cs (660 keV) sources located
in diﬀerent positions a few millimeters distant
from the collimator have been used both to sim-
ulate the 188Re energy spectrum and to evaluate
the spatial resolution of the detector. In addition
241Am and 57Co, together with 99mTc photons,
permit the calibration of energy scale. The over-
all energy spectrum is presented in Fig. 2 and
the cumulative image of the sources is visible in
Fig. 3. The 60 keV is well prominent and a 122

spectra measured with the YAP camera.

The 188Re photon spectrum measured with a
Ge detector is shown in Fig. 4. The 155 keV line
is prominent, but many more lines are present at
higher energy, in some cases, e.g. at ∼300 keV,
with BRs only a factor of ten lower, or at 800-
1200 keV with intensities lower only by a factor
of 100 [13].

The 188Re spectrum measured with the YAP
camera during the imaging of a C57 mouse (see
next section) is shown in Fig. 5. The spectrum is
shown before and after applying the corrections
for energy non-uniformity, and a clear improve-
ment is observed with the shrinking of the 155
keV peak. After the corrections, the energy reso-
lution is ∆E/E ∼ 33% @ 155 keV.

4. FIRST MEASUREMENTS WITH

188Re

The labelling reaction of HA using 188Re was
carried out with good yields (65-70%). The radio-
labelled compound was puriﬁed with a size exclu-
sion chromatographic method before being used
for biodistribution studies. Stability studies in
rat serum conﬁrmed the maintaining of the Re
linked to the polymer and there was no evidence
of radio-decomposition after a few hours.

The radiotoxicity of 188Re has been tested “in
vitro” and compared with 99mTc, with which no
eﬀect is expected. Cells of the M5076 tumor line
have been treated with 188Re and 99mTc solu-
tions, and irradiated with X-rays. The number
of binucleate cells and of micronuclei in the cells
is then counted. M5076 cells turn to out to be
highly sensitive to X-rays (0.25-2 Gy)[3]. Activi-
ties of 150-300 µCi of 99mTc show no eﬀect, but
188Re β-rays, with similar initial activities inte-
grated during 72 h, seem to be quite eﬃcient in
inducing DNA damage[14].

To test the full chain, from the radiolabelling
to to the imaging “in vivo”, a C57 black mouse
(healthy, female) has been injected with 188Re-
HA. After general anesthesia, the solution with
an activity of about 250 µCi was injected in the

detector.

caudal vein. The mouse was positioned along the
diagonal of the FOV, with the locus of injection
outside it, and was monitored for about three
hours. The image collected in the ﬁrst ﬁve min-
utes shows a large spot close to the locus of injec-
tion in the tail (Fig. 6). After 5 mins the activity
concentrates roughly in the centre of the body, in
a volume which contains the liver (Fig. 7). The
activity is slowly decreasing during the 3 h of the
measurement. After 3 h the mouse was sacriﬁced,
and the organs were extracted and measured with
a microcurimeter (Fig. 8). The liver contains
60% of the residual activity and close by organs
another 20%, in agreement with the scintigraﬁc
image (Fig. 7), where individual organs are not
resolved. Even with limited resolution the test
shows that it is possible to monitor the biodistri-
bution of 188Re in mice, with a potential saving
in the number of animals needed for testing the
188Re therapy.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary results obtained using a new YAP
camera in imaging 188Re sources and C57 black
mice injected with a 188Re-HA solution have been

presented. To increase the space resolution with-
out losing sensitivity, and to obtain diﬀerent pro-
jections simultaneously, we are building two new
cameras to be positioned at 90 degrees around the
animal. They use a CsI(Tl) matrix with 1×1×5
mm3 pixels read out by H8500 Hamamatsu Flat
panel PMT [10]. Parallel-hole Pb collimators 20
mm thick, with 1 mm diameter hexagonal holes
and 0.2 mm thick septa, will be mounted in front
of the scintillators. Also specially made collima-
tors with thicker septa and/or diﬀerent absorber
material will be used. The front-end electronics

be mounted on a rotating support in order to pro-
duce tomographic images.

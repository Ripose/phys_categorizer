Abstract

The modern imaging techniques of Positron Emission Tomography and of Single
Photon Emission Computed Tomography are not only two of the most important
tools for studying the functional characteristics of the brain, but they now also play
a vital role in several areas of clinical medicine, including neurology, oncology and
cardiology. The basic mathematical problems associated with these techniques are
the construction of the inverse of the Radon transform and of the inverse of the so
called attenuated Radon transform respectively. We ﬁrst show that, by employing
mathematical techniques developed in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations,
it is possible to obtain analytic formulas for these two inverse transforms. We then
present algorithms for the numerical implementation of these analytic formulas,
based on approximating the given data in terms of cubic splines. Several numerical
tests are presented which suggest that our algorithms are capable of producing
accurate reconstruction for realistic phantoms such as the well known Shepp–Logan
phantom.

1 Introduction

Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomogra-
phy (SPECT) are two modern imaging techniques with a wide range of medical applica-
tions. Although these techniques were originally developed for the study of the functional
characteristics of the brain, they are now used in many diverse areas of clinical medicine.
For example a recent editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine [1] emphasized
the importance of PET in oncologic imaging. Other medical applications of PET and
SPECT are presented in [2]–[22].

The ﬁrst step in PET is to inject the patient with a dose of a suitable radiopharmaceuti-
cal. For example in brain imaging a typical such radiopharmaceutical is ﬂurodeoxyglucose
(FDG), which is a normal molecule of glucose attached artiﬁcially to an atom of radioac-
tive ﬂuorine. The cells in the brain which are more active have a higher metabolism, need

1

more energy, thus will absorb more FDG. The ﬂuorine atom in the FDG molecule suﬀers a
radioactive decay, emitting a positron. When a positron collides with an electron it liber-
ates energy in the form of two beams of gamma rays travelling in opposite direction, which
are picked by the PET scanner. SPECT is similar to PET but the radiopharmaceuticals
decay to emit a single photon.

In both PET and SPECT the radiating sources are inside the body, and the aim is
to determine the distribution g(x1, x2) of the relevant radiopharmaceutical from measure-
ments made outside the body of the emitted radiation. If f (x1, x2) is the x–ray attenuation
coeﬃcient of the body, then it is straightforward to show [23] that the intensity I outside
the body measured by a detector which picks up only radiation along the straight line L
is given by

I =

e−

L(x) f dsgdτ

(1.1)

ZL

R
where τ is a parameter along L, and L(x) denotes the section of L between the point
(x1, x2) and the detector. The attenuation coeﬃcient f (x1, x2) is precisely the function
measured by the usual computed tomography. Thus the basic mathematical problem in
SPECT is to determine the function g(x1, x2) from the knowledge of the “transmission”
function f (x1, x2) (determined via computed tomography) and the “emission” function I
(known from the measurements).

In PET the situation is simpler. Indeed, since the sources eject particles pairwise in
opposite directions and the radiation in opposite directions is measured simultaneously,
equation (1.1) is replaced by

I =

e−

(1.2)

where L+, L− are the two half–lines of L with endpoint x. Since L+ + L− = L, equation
(1.2) becomes

I = e−

L f dτ

gdτ.

R

ZL

We recall that the line integral of the function f (x1, x2) along L is precisely what is known
from the measurements in the usual computed tomography. Thus since both I and the
integral of f (x1, x2) are known (from the measurements of SPECT and of computed to-
mography respectively), the basic mathematical problem of PET is to determine g(x1, x2)
from the knowledge of its line integrals. This mathematical problem is identical with the
basic mathematical problem of computed tomography.

Mathematical Methods

struct a function f from the knowledge of its Radon transform ˆf , i.e. to solve equation
(1.4) for f (x1, x2) in terms of ˆf(ρ, θ). The relevant formula is called the inverse Radon

Organization of the Paper

In Section 2 we ﬁrst review the analysis of equation (1.7), and then show that if one uses
the basic result obtained in this analysis, it is possible to construct immediately the inverse
attenuated Radon transform.
In Section 3 we present a new numerical reconstruction
algorithm for both PET and SPECT. This algorithm is based on approximating the given
data in terms of cubic splines. We recall that both the exact inverse Radon transform
as well as the exact inverse attenuated Radon transform involve the Hilbert transform of
the data functions. For example, the inverse Radon transform involves the function

h(ρ, θ) =

∞

−∞

(1.9)

Existing numerical approaches use the convolution property of the Fourier transform to
compute the Hilbert transform and employ appropriate ﬁlters to eliminate high frequen-
cies.
It appears that our approach has the advantage of simplifying considerably the
mathematical formulas associated with these techniques. Furthermore, accurate recon-
struction is achieved, for noiseless data, with the additional use of an averaging or of
a median ﬁlter. Several numerical tests are presented in Section 4. One of these tests
involves the Shepp–Logan phantom [26], see Figure 3(c).

Numerical algorithms based on the ﬁltered back projection are discussed in [27]–[30],

while algorithms based on iterative techniques can be found in [31]–[33].

2 Mathematical Methods

We ﬁrst review the basic result of [24]. It will be shown later that using this result
it is possible to derive both the inverse Radon as well as the inverse attenuated Radon
transforms in a straightforward manner.

Equations (2.1) and (2.5) deﬁne a change of variables from (x1, x2) to (z, ¯z). Using this
change of variables to compute ∂x1 and ∂x2 in terms of ∂z and ∂¯z, equation (1.7) becomes
(2.2).

We now derive equation (2.3). The derivation is based on the following two steps, which
have been used extensively in the ﬁeld of nonlinear integrable PDEs, see for example [34].
(i) In the ﬁrst step (sometimes called the direct problem), we consider equation (2.2)
as an equation which deﬁnes µ in terms of f , and we construct an integral representation
of µ in terms of f , for all complex values of λ. This representation is

thus equation (2.7) becomes (2.6).

(ii) In the second step (sometimes called the inverse problem), we analyze the ana-
lyticity properties of µ with respect to λ, and we ﬁnd an alternative representation for
µ. This representation involves certain integrals of f called spectral functions. For our
problem, this representation is equation (2.3). Indeed, since µ is an analytic function of

Since g is analytic and periodic, this equispaced quadrature converges at spectral speed
[36]. In other words, (3.2) represents the optimal quadrature formula for the above integral
and its implementation is likely to result in high precision even for relatively small values
of N. For the numerical calculation of hρ(ρ, θ) we suppose that ˆf (ρ, θ) is given, for every

We also notice that we have tried subdivision of the interval (α, β) into several intervals
and the improvement is very minor. Therefore we use just one interval, i.e. two function
evaluations per quadrature, since the major increase in running time of the program
implicit in using panel quadrature is not justiﬁed by the modest improvement in accuracy.
For the numerical calculation of the integrals in (3.10) and (3.15) we use again for-
mula (3.2), resulting in spectral convergence. For the numerical calculation of the partial
derivatives rx1 and rx2 in (3.10) we use the forward diﬀerence scheme

for the ﬁrst half of the interval [

1, 1], and the backward diﬀerence scheme

for the second half.

Thus, for the numerical calculation of g(x1, x2) from the data ˆf (ρ, θ) and ˆgf (ρ, θ)
we apply the following procedure: First we calculate the second derivatives ˆf ′′
i , using
subroutine spline. Consequently, we calculate h(ρ, θ) using (3.12) and (3.13) for all
given ρ and θ. We note that if
= 1, then, since we have assumed compact support,
ˆf (ρ, θ) = 0, thus the ﬁrst term in (3.12) is absent. We then calculate f cpe(ρ, θ) and
f spe(ρ, θ) using (3.6), as well as f c(ρ, θ) and f s(ρ, θ) using (3.8) (at this stage we use the

ρi|

|

12

second data function ˆgf ). Finally we calculate, again using spline, the second derivatives
for the natural cubic spline interpolation of the functions f c(ρ, θ) and f s(ρ, θ).

Having calculated all the necessary second derivatives we now proceed as follows: First
we calculate ˆf (ρ, θ) for any x1, x2 (and θ) using (2.10) and (3.3). For this purpose we
have used subroutine splint from Numerical Recipes. Consequently we calculate h(ρ, θ)
using (3.14). Then we calculate f cme(ρ, θ) and f sme(ρ, θ) using (3.7), f c(ρ, θ) and f s(ρ, θ)
using splint and ﬁnally hc(ρ, θ) and hs(ρ, θ) using relations similar to (3.14). These last
six functions are used in (3.11). We then calculate I(τ, ρ, θ) as described earlier. Finally
we calculate r(τ, ρ, θ) using (3.11) and consequently g(x1, x2) using (3.10).

4 Numerical Tests

The θ points are equally spaced in [0, 2π], while the ρ points are equally spaced in
1, 1]. The density plots presented below were drawn by using Mathematica [38]. The
[
−
dark color represents zero (or negative) values while the white color represents the maxi-
mum value of the original (or reconstructed) function.

First we tested the PET algorithm for the three diﬀerent phantoms shown in Figures
3. Figures (a) and (b) were taken from [28] and [30], respectively. These ﬁgures depict the
attenuation coeﬃcient for a function f (x1, x2) modelling a section of a human thorax. The
small circles represent bones and the larger ellipses the lungs. Figure (c) is the well known
Shepp–Logan phantom, which provides a model of a head section. All these phantoms
consist of diﬀerent ellipses with various densities.

Using the Radon transform (1.4), we computed the data function ˆf (ρ, θ) for 200 points
for θ and 100 points for ρ. This computation was carried out by using Mathematica. We
then used these data in the numerical algorithm to reevaluate f (x1, x2). Furthermore, in
order to remove the eﬀect of the Gibbs–Wilbraham phenomenon, we applied an averaging
ﬁlter as follows: We ﬁrst found the maximum value (max) of f (x1, x2) in the reconstructed
image. We then set to zero those values of f (x1, x2) which were less than 1
20 max. Finally
we applied the averaging ﬁlter with averaging parameter a = 0.005. This ﬁltering proce-
dure was applied ﬁve times, with the additional elimination of those values of f (x1, x2)
which were less than 1
20 max at the end of the procedure. In Figures 4 and 5 we present
the results before and after the ﬁltering procedure, respectively. The reconstruction took
place in a 500

500 grid.

We then tested the SPECT algorithm for the three diﬀerent phantoms shown in Figures
6. Figures (a) and (b) were taken from [28]. In these cases the function f (x1, x2) is given
by Figure 3(a). Figure (c) was taken from [30]. The white ring represents the distribution
of the radiopharmaceutical at the myocardium. In this case the function f (x1, x2) is given
by Figure 3(b).

By using the Radon transform (1.4), and the attenuated Radon transform (1.5), we
computed the data functions ˆf (ρ, θ) and ˆgf (ρ, θ) for 200 values of θ and 100 points of
ρ (again using Mathematica). We consequently used these data in our program to re–
evaluate g(x1, x2). In order to remove the eﬀect of the Gibbs–Wilbraham phenomenon,
a median ﬁlter was used, with the additional elimination of those values of g(x1, x2)
which were less than 1
20 max before and after the application of the ﬁlter. The results
are shown in Figures 7 and 8, before and after the ﬁltering procedure respectively. The
reconstruction took place in a 140

140 grid.

For the above phantoms it seems that even a rough estimation of F (τ, ρ, θ) is suﬃ-
cient for an accurate reconstruction. This means that, in order to compute numerically
F (τ, ρ, θ) using (3.15), it is suﬃcient to use ten equally spaced points for t, rather than
200. This reduces considerably the reconstruction time.

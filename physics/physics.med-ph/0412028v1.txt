Abstract

The problem of determining the neuronal current inside the brain from measure-
ments of the induced magnetic ﬁeld outside the head is discussed under the assump-
tion that the space occupied by the brain is approximately spherical. By inverting
the Geselowitz equation, the part of the current which can be reconstructed from
the measurements is precisely determined. This actually consists of only certain
moments of one of the two functions specifying the tangential part of the current.
The other function specifying the tangential part of the current as well as the radial
part of the current are completely arbitrary. However, it is also shown that with
the assumption of energy minimization, the current can be reconstructed uniquely.
A numerical implementation of this unique reconstruction is also presented.

1 Introduction

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non invasive technique that can be used to
investigate brain activity. The physiological basis of MEG is the following: The main
functional units of the brain are certain highly specialized cells called neurons. For higher
mental processes the most important part of the brain is its outermost layer called cerebral
cortex, which contains at least 1010 neurons. When neurons are active they produce small
currents whose basis is the change in the concentration of certain ions [1] (ionic currents).
The ﬂow of current in the neural system produces a weak magnetic ﬁeld. The measurement
of this ﬁeld outside the brain and the estimation of the current density distribution that
produced this ﬁeld is called MEG. Other names often used are magnetic source imaging,
magnetic ﬁeld tomography, and current–ﬂow imaging.

Neuromagnetic signals are typically 50–500f T , which are of the order of 10−9 of the
earth’s geomagnetic ﬁeld. Currently, the only detector that can measure these tiny ﬁelds
is the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The theory and practice
of SQUID as applied to MEG measurements, as well as several practical approaches for
shielding all other external magnetic ﬁelds except that of the brain, are discussed in the
excellent review [2]. Here we only note that the SQUID, which is the most sensitive
detector of any kind available to scientists [3], is based on the exploitation of several
quantum–mechanical eﬀects, including superconductivity as well as the Josephson eﬀect.
The SQUID can be thought of as a digital magnetometer where each “digit” represents one
ﬂux quantum, and it is essentially a transducer converting a tiny change in magnetic ﬂux
into a voltage. Whole–head magnetometer systems are now used by several laboratories
in Europe, USA and Japan.

The current density J and the magnetic ﬁeld B are related by the Maxwell equations.
These equations can be simpliﬁed using two facts. First, the permeability of the tissue
in the head denoted by µ is that of the free space, i.e. µ = µ0. Second, the quasistatic
approximation is valid, namely the terms ∂E/∂t and ∂B/∂t can be neglected, where E
denotes the electric ﬁeld and B denotes the magnetic induction1. Using these facts the
Maxwell equations become

Equation (1.4) relates Jp inside the head with B outside the head. However, it also
involves the value of V on the surface of the head. This serious complication can be

The main diﬃculty with the above inverse problem is that it is not unique. This fact
was already known to Helmholtz since 1853 [9]. For example, it is clear from equation (1.5)
that the radial part of Jp does not contribute to U. However, in spite of intense scrutiny
by many investigators, the fundamental question of which part of Jp can be reconstructed
remained open.

Here we ﬁrst give a complete answer to this question, see theorem 2: Jp can be

uniquely decomposed in the form

where eρ, eθ, eϕ are the unit vectors associated with the spherical coordinates (ρ, θ, ϕ)
and J ρ, G, F are scalar functions of (ρ, θ, ϕ). This decomposition for vector ﬁelds on the
sphere is the analogue of the celebrated Helmholtz decomposition for vector ﬁelds on R3.
We will show that knowledge of U determines only certain moments of F with respect to
ρ, while J ρ and G are arbitrary. More precisely, it can be shown that U can be represented
ℓ,m cℓ,mρ−(ℓ+1)Yℓ,m(θ, ϕ), where Yℓ,m are the usual spherical harmonics
in the form U =
and the constants cℓ,m are determined from the measurements. Then we will show that

The above results imply that by decomposing Jp into a “silent” component and into
an “eﬀective” component, we can show that the Geselowitz integral operator provides an
one to one map of the eﬀective component of Jp into the magnetic ﬁeld B, or into the
magnetic potential U, outside the brain. Furthermore, given U the eﬀective component
can be explicitly computed. We emphasise that, since the decomposition into a silent and
into an eﬀective part is of a general nature independent of any assumptions on Jp, our
result that U determines the eﬀective component of the current uniquely and says nothing
about the silent component, is actually a general statement which is model independent.

3

The next part of the paper deals with the case when we assume some relations between
the eﬀective and the silent components: We will show that if one requires that Jp is such
that energy is minimized, then Jp is indeed unique, see theorem 3: In this case J ρ, G, F
are given by the equations

J ρ = G = 0, F =

The non uniqueness of the inverse problem has been the Achilles heel of MEG. For
example in the most comprehensive review on MEG [2], it is written that “with the
assumption that MEG mainly reﬂects the activity in the tangential part of the cortical
currents”, while in [10] it is written “what cannot be seen should not be looked for”. Even
the “father” of MEG, D. Cohen has stated [11] “identifying those tangential sources, rather
than localization, is the real use of the MEG, there is no localization magic”. We hope
that both the analytical and the numerical results presented here will contribute towards
determining the advantages as well as the limitations of MEG.

Regarding other brain imaging techniques we note that at present time the most
important such techniques are the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the
positron emission tomography (PET) and the single photon emission computed tomog-
raphy (SPECT), as well as a new version of electroencephalography (EEG). These tech-
niques involve tradeoﬀs among the following important considerations: temporal resolu-
tion, spatial resolution, invasiveness, and cost. Assuming that the question of uniqueness
of the MEG is answered, the spatial resolution of MEG (1cm), of PET and SPECT (4–
5mm), and of fMRI (1.5mm) are similar; the spatial resolution of the conventional EEG
is quite poor. On the other hand the time resolution of EEG and MEG is much better
than that of PET, SPECT and fMRI. The time resolution of PET, SPECT and MRI is of
the order of 1 second, while that of MEG and EEG is of the order of 10 milliseconds. This
is a crucial factor if one wants to study brain dynamics. For example, MEG data suggest
that speech areas of the brain are activated 100 milliseconds after the visual areas. MEG
is the only truly non invasive method. EEG is minimally invasive (placing electrodes on
the scalp), while in PET, SPECT and MRI the subject is exposed to radioactive tracers
and to strong magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. EEG requires a rather inexpensive apparatus
(of the order of thousands of dollars). The fMRI has the advantage that can be obtained
by modifying the existing MRI apparatus. PET employs positron–emitting radionuclides
which have such short half–lives that there must be a cyclotron near the site of scanning,
thus the cost is of the order of multimillion dollars. The cost of the MEG is similar to
that of the PET.

We conclude the introduction with some remarks:

(a) We expect that the combination of our analysis of the spherical model and pertur-
bation theory can be used to study realistic head geometries. In this respect we also
note that progress has been recently made regarding ellipsoidal geometry [12].

4

(b) The question of what additional information can one obtain by measuring E (using

EEG) is under investigation.

(c) Due to the orthogonality of the decomposition of Jp into silent and eﬀective com-
ponents, the assumptions that the L2 norm of the solution is minimal, implies that
the silent component vanishes. Clearly, one can assume other relations between the
silent and the eﬀective components, for example one may assume that the current
consists of a ﬁnite number of dipoles. It is well known that this assumption, un-
der certain conditions, also leads to a unique solution. This current can also be
represented in the form (1.6) with F of a particular form, and therefore can be con-
sidered within our formulation. Thus the answer becomes model dependent only at
the stage when one makes an assumption about the form of Jp. For other models
see [13]-[15].

(d) “Least–square” methods have been used extensively in inverse problems. However,
our approach of using such methods in order to ﬁnd an approximate numerical
solution of the Geselowitz equation is fundamentally diﬀerent than the existing
ones. Indeed, it is based on the explicit decomposition of the current into a silent
and an eﬀective component, and thus could not have been used before obtaining
this decomposition.

(e) In practice, the magnetic ﬁeld is measured approximately over a half–sphere over the
head and not over a whole sphere. However, since in the numerical reconstruction we
assume a ﬁnite number of spherical harmonics, the approximate knowledge of U over
part of a sphere is suﬃcient to determine approximately the current. Clearly the
problem becomes more and more ill-posed when the number of spherical harmonics
increases. A stability result in this direction is under investigation.

(f) It has been correctly pointed out by one of the referees that it is suﬃcient for
the solution of the inverse problem to invert ∂U/∂|x| instead of U. Furthermore it
has been correctly pointed out that this latter inversion is much simpler since the
expression for ∂U/∂|x| is simpler than the expression of U (see [5]).

(g) A short summary of the analytical results presented here was announced in [16].

2 Analytical Results

We ﬁrst show that equations (1.5) can be written in an alternative form, which is more
convenient for determining the part of Jp which can be reconstructed from the knowledge
of U(x).

be expressed by the alternative representation

The assumption that fℓ,m(1) = 0 is without loss of generality since the tangential part of
the energy which is given by equation (2.15) does not involve diﬀerentiation over ρ, thus
in general (2.15) can be obtained by approximating f by functions equal to zero at ρ = 1
and then passing to the limit.

The minimization of this H, under the constraint (2.9), implies (2.14).
We note that equation (1.5) implies that U(x) behaves like 0(ρ−2), hence ℓ > 0 in

3.1 Computation of cℓ,m

We ﬁrst discuss how to compute cℓ,m from either U(ρ, θ, ϕ) or from B(ρ, θ, ϕ).
Suppose we know U(ρ, θ, ϕ) for one speciﬁc value of ρ > 1 and for some equally spaced

values θi, ϕj, such us

For the numerical calculation of the Legendre functions Pℓ,m(cos θ) we use subroutine
plgndr from Numerical Recipes [17]. The constants aℓ,m are given by (3.2).

Suppose we know B = (B1, B2, B3) instead of U. Then, using the ﬁrst relation in (1.5)

and spherical coordinates we obtain

Uρ = sin θ cos ϕ ˜B1 + sin θ sin ϕ ˜B2 + cos θ ˜B3,

Moreover, by diﬀerentiating (2.10) with respect to ρ we ﬁnd

Therefore, after calculating the coeﬃcients cℓ,m following the procedure outlined earlier
we can use either (3.8) or (3.9) to re–evaluate either U or Uρ. In this way not only can
we test the eﬃciency of our procedure, but we can also run our program several times, in
order to ﬁnd the most appropriate value for ℓmax.

3.2 Computation of the Minimizing Current

Using relations (2.14), (3.1) and the second relation in (3.3), the real parts of the

Thus, in order to calculate numerically the current we apply the following procedure:
We take some θ and ϕ points, such that 0
2π. We ﬁrst calculate
the Legendre functions Pℓ,m(cos θ). In a separate subroutine we calculate the quantities
Pℓ,m(cos θ)/ sin θ (for this purpose we have developed a subroutine similar to plgndr).
These quantities appear in both (3.10) and the second relation of (3.12). Note that these
quantities are valid even for θ = 0 or θ = π. We then calculate from (3.12) the quantities
ℓ,m(cos θ). Finally, we take a value of ρ such as 0 < ρ < 1 and calculate J θ(ρ, θ, ϕ)
−
from (3.10) and J ϕ(ρ, θ, ϕ) from (3.11). In all the above we use the ℓmax value that was
found with the procedure outlined in the previous subsection.

3.3 Veriﬁcation of the Algorithm

We have tested our numerical algorithm for several functions U(ρ, θ, ϕ).

In what

follows we discuss two typical examples.

U(ρ, θ, ϕ) =

ρ3 .

Note that this function has the form (2.10) with cℓ,m = 0 for ℓ > 2.

First, we evaluate U for ρ = 1.5 and some equally spaced θi and ϕj, where imax = 100,
jmax = 200. We calculate numerically the coeﬃcients cℓ,m from the ﬁrst relation of (3.3),
(3.4) and (3.5), and then evaluate from (3.8) Ua, the approximate value of U, at the above
ρ, θi and ϕj. Furthermore, we start with Uρ instead of a U, we calculate cℓ,m in a similar
way and then calculate the approximate value of Uρ from (3.9).

U

We run our program several times with lmax from 1 up to 40 and we found that the
best value is lmax = 2, which is consistent with the exact form of U. For this value the
diﬀerence

Ua|
Secondly, we calculate numerically J θ, J ϕ, using (3.10)–(3.12), in the above θi, ϕj and
some equally spaced ρk, such as 0
1, namely k = 0, . . . , kmax, where kmax = 25.
Then we calculate analytically cℓ,m from (2.10), F from (2.14), and J θ, J ϕ from (2.7). For
the above U we have

The analytical and the numerical values of J θ and J ϕ in the various θi, ϕj and ρk are
almost the same (the absolute value of their diﬀerence is of order 10−7, at most).

We have also veriﬁed the validity of equation (2.8) as follows: We take F from (3.13)

equally spaced θi and ϕj, as in Example 1. We again calculate numerically the coeﬃcients
cℓ,m and then Ua.

We will show that J θ and J ϕ can be expressed by equation (2.7). Indeed, if

Remark.

In the case of R3, the analogous decomposition is given by Helmholtz
theorem: Let A = Axi + Ayj + Azk, where i, j, k are the unit vectors along the x,
y, z axis, be a vector ﬁeld in R3. Then there exists a function G and a vector ﬁeld
B = Bxi + Byj + Bzk such that A =
B. A relationship between the general
decomposition and the one in R3 can be established using the following facts: (i) A
diﬀerential 1–form α = αx dx + αy dy + αz dz can be canonically identiﬁed with the vector
ﬁeld A, where Ax = αx, Ay = αy, Az = αz. (ii) In R3 the Hodge operator transforms
a diﬀerential 1–form α into the diﬀerential 2–form β = βxy dxdy + βyz dydz + βxz dxdz,
where βyz = αx, βxz =
αy, βxy = αz. (iii) There do not exist any nonzero harmonic
1–forms in R3.

Abstract

As a result of nuclear power plant accidents, large areas receive ra-
dioactive inputs of 137Cs. This cesium accumulates in herbs growing in
such territories. The problem is whether the herbs contaminated by radio-
cesium may be used as a raw material for medicine. The answer depends
on the amount of 137Cs transfered from the contaminated raw material
to the medicine. We have presented new results of the transfer of 137Cs
from contaminated Digitalis grandiﬂora Mill. and Convallaria majalis L.
to medicine. We found that the extraction of 137Cs depends strongly on
the hydrophilicity of the solvent. For example 96.5%(vol.) ethyl alcohol
extracts less 137Cs (11.6 %) than 40%(vol.) ethyl alcohol or pure water
(66.2 %). The solubility of the cardiac glycosides is inverse to the solu-
bility of cesium, which may be of use in the technological processes for
manufacturing ecologically pure herbal medicine.

Key words: Herbal raw material; Herbal medicine; 137Cs contamina-

1 Introduction

At the present time, herbal medicines containing cardiac glycosides are widely
used in the medical treatment of heart disease as the equivalent synthetic ana-
logues are not available yet. The Convallaria and Digitalis species are used as
raw material for the herbal cardiac medicine.
As a result of nuclear power plant accidents, large areas receive radioactive in-
puts of 137Cs. This cesium accumulates in herbs growing in such territories.
The problem is whether the herbs contaminated by radiocesium may be used
as a raw material for medicine. The answer depends on the amount of 137Cs
transfered from the contaminated raw material to the medicine.
After the Chernobyl catastrophe a large area, growing many species of medicinal
plants (such as Convallaria majalis L., Rhamnus catartica L., Acorus calamus
L., Vaccinium vitisidea L., Vaccinium myrtillus L. etc.) was contaminated with
a high concentration of radionuclides. The main contaminant (more then 90%
of the overall radioactivity) of the Ukrainian Polessie is 137Cs [1]. The majority
(85 to 97% ) of 137Cs is located in the soil layer at a depth of 0 to 10 cm, where
the roots of the medicinal herbs take up the 137Cs [2].
Various solvents are used in the pharmaceutical industry to prepare the herbal
medicinal products. The poperties of these solvents deﬁne a quantitative and
qualitative structure of substances that can be extracted. The literature gives
some often contradictory information on the transfer of 137Cs from medicinal
plant raw material to water and alcohol. Several studies [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have
shown that the amount of radionuclide transferred from the soil to the raw ma-
terial varied in wide range (from 10 to 250 fold). This diﬀerence was mainly
determined by speciﬁc features of the plants and depended strongly on the type
of soil and climatic conditions which occurred during the vegetative period. The
transfer of 137Cs from the plant raw material is 24-75% for the aqueous medic-
inal products and is 20-30% for the alcoholic ones [8, 9, 10, 11]. Grodzinskii
et al. [12] found that the speciﬁc activity of 137Cs in water extracts was three
orders of magnitude less than in the initial plant raw material.
One can conclude, from the above publications that experiments have been
mainly devoted to studying the transfer of 137Cs from plant raw material to
water and some galenical preparations. Systematic studies of the dependency
of radionuclide extraction eﬃciency on various types of solvents have not been
done yet. Therefore the study of radionuclide transfer from soil to herbs and
from herbs to the herbal medicinal products is very important.

In this paper we present our experimental results on the eﬀect of solvent
type (pure water, 40%(vol.), 70%(vol.) and 96.5%(vol.) aqueous ethyl alcohol)
on 137Cs extraction eﬃciency.

2 Methods

2

2.1 Raw material

We studied the medicinal plant species (the herbs Digitalis grandiﬂora Mill,
ﬂowers and leaves of Convallaria majalis L.) containing cardiac glycosides. The
raw material was taken from an experimental plot of the Povchansk forest area,
Luginy district, Zhitomir region where the soil contamination by 137Cs ranged
from 296 to 925 kBq
m2 and the radioactivity of the tested plant raw material was
1.17 – 50.83 kBq
kg (see Table 1). All raw plant material was rolled three times in
preparation for the extraction process.

2.2 Tinctures and aqueous extracts

We used the following solvents: pure water, 40%(vol.), 70%(vol.) and 96.5%(vol.)
aqueous ethyl alcohol without heating and vaporization of solvent. Samples (10.0
g aliquots) of raw material were put in glass extractors, ﬁlled up with the ap-
propriate concentration of solvent and let stand for extraction. After 48 hours,
the extracts were discharged to a ﬂask and the extractors were ﬁlled up with a
new portion of the solvent for further extraction. The operation was repeated
after 24 hours and 48 hours to obtain the second and third extracts. Then the
solvent residuals were removed using vacuum and added to the extracts. All
extracts were combined to obtain the primary tinctures of 100 ml volume.

2.3 Decoctions

The solvent that we used was hot water. The 10.0 g samples of raw material were
put in glass vessels, ﬁlled up with pure water and boiled for 15 minutes. After
that these vessels were cooled and kept at room temperature for 10 minutes.
The ﬁltered extracts and the solvent residuals were then combined to give the
decoctions of 100 ml volume.

2.4 Measurement of radioactivity

The γ activity of both the initial raw material and the extracts were measured
during the experiment. The standards of the Health Ministry of Ukraine state
that the speciﬁc activity of 137Cs in medicinal plants must be less than 600 Bq
kg
[13]. We needed to measure a small activity and commercial devices (like the
LP – 4900B) have insuﬃcient sensitivity, therefore we used the γ detector from
the Institute for Single Crystals (Kharkov, Ukraine). The scintillator (BGO)
was a cylinder with d=40 mm and h=40 mm. The detector was calibrated with
60Co (Eγ=1.173 M eV , Eγ=1.332 M eV ) and 137Cs (Eγ =0.662 M eV ) sources
from a standard calibration set before measurements. For the Eγ= 0.662 M eV
photon the energy resolution of the detector was determined to be 13.4%. The
photopeak eﬃciency of photon registration for the point source was ε=0.42. The
detector and samples were placed inside a 5 cm thick lead shield to decrease
the background. The background at the 0.662 M eV peak region was about 0.2
[ count
sec ]. The samples were measured directly inside Marinelli’s vessel (100 ml

3

kg ] = 31.5×Nph.p., where Nph.p.[

count ]. The activity of 137Cs in the
1
sec×kg ]

volume). The detector eﬃciency was 31.5 [ Bq×sec
samples was determined by formula A [ Bq
is the number of counts in the photopeak of the measured substance.
The data acquisition system was assembled in CAMAC standard. The γ spec-
trum parameters were calculated with the MINUIT program from the ROOT
package [14].
All samples were measured over a wide range of photon energy (0.1 – 2.0 M eV ).
Only one peak at 0.662 M eV was detected which meant that 137Cs was present
and therefore we only studied the transfer of 137Cs. The statistical error of the
measurements did not exceed 5%. The absolute error was 15% and depended
on the standard calibrated source of 137Cs.

3 Results and discussion

The results of the determination of 137Cs transfer from the herbs to alcohol-
water and pure water extracts are presented in Table 1. From the table one can
see that for the plants investigated, the 137Cs transfer does not depend on the
type of raw material (within the error limits). The reason for certain scattering
of the data for 137Cs transfer for 96.5%(vol.) alcohol can be due to saturation
of solvent by cesium.

Studying the dependence of the 137Cs transfer on the solvent hydrophilicity
shows that for 96.5%(vol.) alcohol the transfer of 137Cs to the extract is minimal,
ranging from 4.6 to 17.6%. For 70%(vol.) alcohol the transfer reaches 45.3 to
In our experiments the maximal amount of 137Cs was extracted by
66.5%.
40%(vol.) alcohol (62.8 to 83.2%) and pure water at room temperature (63.0 to
73.0%). Decoctions extracted radiocesium similar to 70%(vol.) alcohol (49.3 to
60.8%) but less than 40%(vol.) alcohol or pure water at room temperature. The
reason is that in the process of heating some of the cesium chemically interacts
with the raw material and can not be extracted.

As follows from our results the 96.5%(vol.) alcohol extracts less (about 6
times) 137Cs than 40%(vol.). From Table 2 one can see that solubility of the
cardiac glycosides strongly depends on solvent type and the solubility tendency
of the cardiac glycosides is inverse to cesium [15]. Methanol extracts the car-
diac glycosides much more (a factor of 570 for Digitoxin and a factor of 18 for
Convallatoxin) as compared to water. Thus the ratio of 137Cs to the cardiac
glycosides extracted strongly depends on solvent type.

4 Conclusion

We have presented new results on the transfer of 137Cs from raw material to
medicine. We have found that the extraction of 137Cs from Digitalis grandi-
ﬂora Mill. and Convallaria majalis L. containing cardiac glycosides strongly
depends on solvent hydrophilicity and where 96.5%(vol.) alcohol extracts less
137Cs (about 6 times) than 40%(vol.) or pure water. The solubility tendency of

4

the cardiac glycosides is inverse to that of cesium and this fact can be of use in
the technological processes for manufacturing ecologically pure herbal medicine.

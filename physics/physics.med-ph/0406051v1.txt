Abstract

An analytical expression has been developed to describe the effects of T2 relaxation and diffusing
spatially modulated longitudinal spins during the signal build period of an HOMOGENIZED cross peak.
Diffusion of the longitudinal spins results in a lengthening of the effective dipolar demagnetization time,
delaying the re-phasing of coupled anti-phase states in the quantum picture. In the classical picture the
unwinding rate of spatially twisted magnetization is no longer constant, but decays exponentially with
time. The expression is experimentally veriﬁed for the HOMOGENIZED spectrum of 100mM TSP in
H2O at 4.7T.

Introduction

HOMOGENIZED[13] and its variants[2, 9] and the recently proposed IDEAL[14] sequences have great
potential for in-vivo spectroscopy[10]. Diffusion weighting in HOMOGENIZED is present both to give
intentional diffusion weighting and as a side effect of the various gradients present. Stekjsal-Tanner (ST)
diffusion weighting[12] during the t1 (mix) and t2 (build) periods of the sequence can be used to suppress
radiation dampening. Enhanced diffusion weighting[15, 4, 3] is obtained during t1. There is an additional
t2 dependent diffusion weighting possible, due to the iZQC gradient Gzq and β pulse combination. The
weighting results from diffusing modulated longitudinal magnetization, and does not behave as ST diffusion
weighting. Kennedy et al.[11] have shown recently that this diffusion weighting has the novel property of
being insensitive to object motion.

We have concentrated our efforts on the 2d HOMOGENIZED sequence shown in ﬁgure 1.
The sequence consists of three RF pulses, α for excitation, β to convert helical transverse magnetization
to Mz modulation, and π to form a spin echo. The Ga1, Ga2 gradient pair yields ST diffusion weighting
and radiation damping suppression during t1. The Gb1, Gb2 gradient pair accomplishes the same during
t2. The Gc1, Gc2 gradient pairs crush transverse magnetization created at π due to pulse imperfections
and B1 inhomogeneity, as well as introduce some additional diffusion weighting. The Gzq gradient selects
intermolecular zero quantum coherences (iZQCs) in the quantum picture. In the classical picture the Gzq
gradient in combination with β creates spatially modulated longitudinal magnetization whose magnetic ﬁeld
causes unwinding (and eventually rewinding) of helically twisted transverse magnetization[8].

A 2d HOMOGENIZED experiment (see ﬁgure 3) is carried out by incrementing t1 over multiple acqui-
sitions. In a two (or multiple) component system where only one component is present in high concentration

(the solvent S), cross peaks with the solute component of interest I will be formed at (F 1, F 2) = (I −S, I)
the ”p” type iZQC and (S −I, I) the ”n” type iZQC. Axial iZQC peaks are formed at (0, I) and (0, S). The
equation for peak amplitudes, neglecting radiation damping, T2 relaxation, and diffusion has been described
in the literature[1].

Theory

For the ﬁrst time, to the authors’ knowledge, an analytical expression, equation (4), for the cross peak
amplitude in the presence of diffusion and T2 relaxation has been developed. Some preliminary deﬁnitions
precede the expression, notation follows Ahn et al.[1]

τSef f (2) has been deﬁned to take account of T2 and diffusion losses (ST b-values, ba and bzq) incurred
during t1 before β beta forms Mz. τS is the dipolar demagnetization time for spin S as per reference [1].

and τS = 200ms. Three situations are shown:
Black - negligible diffusion
Dark Gray - diffusion of Mz has delayed the maximum and stretched the zero crossings to longer times.
Light Gray - Mz modulation has completely diffused away before the maximum can be obtained.

where Mp is the p-type cross peak amplitude. ba , bb, and bc are the ST b-values due to the Ga, Gb, Gc
gradient pairs, respectively. Gzq also introduces some ST diffusion weighting bzq in the short delay before
β.

The effect of F (t2) is to stretch the time axis when diffusion weighting is signiﬁcant. Equation (4)
is valid as long as S and I are separated by 1/τS in frequency, so that only longitudinal S magnetization
contributes to signal build. Steady state values (T R < 5 T S
1 ) may be used for τS and M0, as long as
diffusion has eliminated residual spatial modulation of longitudinal magnetization[6]. As long as the a and
b gradient areas are chosen correctly, radiation dampening is not signiﬁcant. Three theoretical situations are
shown in ﬁgure 2. A similar expression has been found for the n-type crosspeak amplitude Mn.

Experimental Results

A series of low resolution (512x64) HOMOGENIZED spectra were obtained with various strengths of Gzq
(see ﬁgure 3). The solvent (S) is water at room temperature, the solute of interest (I) was TSP at 100mM
concentration. Glucose was also present in solution. Field strength is 4.7T yielding nominal τS = 200ms.
A best ﬁt, adjusting M I
0 and τS to account for pulse imperfections and B1 inhomogeneity, was obtained for
the top curve, and kept the same for the other curves. Relaxation rates were measured in separate inversion
1 = 2.57s, T S
recovery and spin echo experiments with T S
2 = 1.62s. Effects such
as B1 inhomogeneity and RF pulse error contribute to lengthen τSef f (reduce available S magnetization).
Comparison of the predicted cross peak amplitude with experiment is shown in ﬁgure 4. An analysis of
axial peaks and T1 effects is in progress[6, 7].

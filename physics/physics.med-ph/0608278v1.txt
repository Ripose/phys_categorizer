ABSTRACT

Comparing both, the more conventional Gompertz tumor growth law (GL) and the “Universal” law (UL), recently
proposed and applied to cancer, we have investigated the growth law’s implications on various radiotherapy regimen.
According to GL, the surviving tumor cell fraction could be reduced ’ad libidum’, independently of the initial tumor
mass, simply by increasing the number of treatments. On the contrary, if tumor growth dynamics would indeed follow
the Universal scaling law, there is a lower limit of the survival fraction that cannot be reduced any further regardless
of the total number of treatments. This ﬁnding can explain the so called “tumor size eﬀect” and re-emphasizes the
importance of early diagnosis as it implies that radiotherapy may be successful provided the tumor mass at treatment
onset is rather small. Taken together with our previous works, implications of these ﬁndings include revisiting standard
radiotherapy regimen and overall treatment protocols.

INTRODUCTION

A more detailed understanding of tumor growth is crucial for the clinical management of the disease and tumor size
is a main determinant of clinical severity and a major factor of the staging criteria before and during radiotherapy
(RT) [1] Tumor regrowth during radiotherapy is therefore an important clinical parameter [2]and, in particular, the
dose-response relationship and thus the probability of treatment beneﬁt critically depend on the tumor re-growth
pattern in the interval between the fractional irradiation treatments.

To clearly evaluate the clinical results ,the tumor cell ’survival fraction’ S , after n irradiations at dose per fraction

d, in the overall treatment time t, is usually written as

−ln(S) = n(αd + βd2) − γt

and depends on the tumor radiosensitivity, expressed by the parameters α and β, , according to the linear-quadratic
model,and on the regrowth parameter γ = ln2/τef f , where τef f is the the average clonogenic doubling time [3]. The
above equation is, up to now, the basis for RT scheduling, and would predict the probability P of tumor control,
deﬁned as P = exp(−cS), being c the clonogen number.

Untreated tumor growth has been usually described by means of the Gompertz law (GL) [4, 5, 6, 7], a non linear
growth pattern proposed a long time ago in actuarial mathematics [8]. Moreover, in a transplantable rat tumor, it
was shown that control and regrowth curves after radiotherapy could be ﬁtted by the same gompertzian law, provided
adjustments for the initial lag and the estimated number of clonogens immediately after irradiation were performed
[9]. Gompertzian growh has been assumed to describe human tumor repopulation during fractional radiotherapy also
by Hansen et al. [10] and by O’Donougue [11].

Recently, an alternative general growth law, based on the scaling properties of the nutrient supplying distributive
network has been proposed [12, 13] which is claimed to be “Universal” since it is able to ﬁt most living organisms’
growth pattern, covering more than 27 orders of magnitude in mass. Since then, their Universal law (UL) has been
shown to ﬁt reasonably well many available data on tumors in vivo and on multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) [14].
In this paper we consider a close analysis of the two diﬀerent growth patterns aiming at evaluating their impact
on clinical treatment regimen. Our results, clinically useful “per se”’, permit to understand some observed, but still
unclear, eﬀects.

TUMOR GROWTH LAWS

Up to 1956 [15] human tumor growth was simply described as “slow” and “rapid” , without any attempt for
quantitative description [16]. A naive view would consider an exponential growth, from a 10 microns cell to a 1 liter
tumor in about 20 doublings. On this basis, from two measurements of volume V1 and V2 at diﬀerent times t1 and t2,
the constant tumor doubling time can be estimated as: τd = (t1 − t2)/ln2(V1/V2). Several studies on animal models
[4] and a couple of very important investigations on breast and prostate cancer in humans [6, 7] showed that, far
from being constant, τd was seen to change during the tumor growth, which is mathematically well described by a
Gompertzian growth kinetics [4, 5, 8]

N (t) = N g

o exp [

(1 − exp(−Kgt)]

ao
Kg

(2)

where N (t) is the number of cells, that is proportional to the tumor mass, Kg and ao are constants and N g

o = N (0).
Although it is generally considered as a phenomenological tool, there are many attempts to derive the Gompertz
law by more fundamental dynamics [17, 18]. In the analysis of in vivo tumor growth a single set of growth parameters
is insuﬃcient to describe the clinical data. Tumor cells have diﬀerent growth conditions and characteristics in diﬀerent
patients and the variation of tumor growth in patient population has been modeled by using a distribution of growth
parameters. It turns out that the data are ﬁtted by a log-normal distribution of the parameter Kg. For example the
∞ = 3.1 ∗ 1012, a mean value of the log-normal
Bloom data on breast cancer [19] are consistent with N g
distribution given by ln(Kg) = −2.9 and a standard deviation ln(Kg) = 0.71 [6].

o = 4.8 ∗ 109, N g

A new model of the tumor growth has recently been proposed on the basis of the paper by West et al. [12] that,
regardless of the diﬀerent masses and development times, shows that many living organisms share a common growth
pattern and, provided masses and growth times are properly rescaled, the same universal exponential curve ﬁts their
ontogenic growth data. This phenomenon is explained by basic cellular mechanism [13] assuming a common fractal
pattern in the vascularization of the investigated taxa. More precisely, starting from a cell number N w
0 ( or mass

r = (N/N∞)
the general growth pattern, that we call Universal Law (UL), follows

4 and σ is a constant ﬁtted by data, , with dimension g1/4/month when M is the tumor mass in g.

Guiot et al. [14] applied this growth pattern to tumors, satisfactorly ﬁtting MTS data, as well as for experimental
rats and mouse tumors and ﬁnally for human breast and prostate cancer. Contrary to GL, the UL has never been
applied to the case of irradiated tumors.

According to the standard clinical procedure, the treatment dose d is given at regular intervals. Let us assume
that the surviving fraction for clonogenic cells is given by the linear-quadratic model ( see eq.1) and the repopulation
speciﬁc rate, λ of the clonogenic cells is a function of the population size λ(N (t)).

Therefore the diﬀerential equation for the considered irradiated system is

1
N

dN
dt

= λ(N (t)) − Σn−1

j=1 (αd + βd2)δ(t − jτ )

where τ is the interval between two treatments, n is the number of treatments fraction given by time t ≥ (n − 1)τ .

For an exponential growth, i.e. constant rate λ(N (t)) = γ = ln 2

T , one obtains eq. (1) with τef f = T , the doubling

time of the exponential law.

For both Gompertz and Universal laws a more detailed analysis ( see Appendix) is needed to evaluate the diﬀerence

between the two growth patterns in the survival fraction S after a realistic irradiation treatment.

In addition to standard treatment ( up to 70 Gy with daily doses of 2 Gy) we investigated also non-standard
treatments schedules recently proposed in the clinical literature. In particular we considered the so called ’hyperfrac-
tionation’, consisting in 3 daily doses of 0.8 Gy for a total of 60 Gy in 4 weeks, ’hypofractionation’ (5 Gy x 5 days for
a total dose of 25 Gy in 1 week) and ’CHART’ protocol (1.5 Gy three times a day for a total dose of 54 Gy).

RESULTS

After the initial phase, the ln(S) computed according the UL can be reduced only by changing applied dose and
interval, yet cannot be further reduced by increasing the number of treatments. This is a strong diﬀerence with respect
to Gompertz growth where the ﬁnal survival fraction can be always reduced by increasing the number of treatments.
As an example, Fig. 1 shows the ln(S) vs. the number of treatments when d = 2 Gy, τ = 1 day (interval between
two treatments), α = 0.3 Gy−1 and α/β = 10 Gy (breast cancer). GL prediction does not depend on the actual tumor
mass, while UL prediction does. Tumor ( asymptotic) ﬁnal mass M is assumed ≃ 640 g [6]. Since M is a parameter
of the West law, it is convenient to deﬁne the tumor mass as a fraction of M. Two cases are considered: the empty
romboids refers to a very small tumor whose mass is 1% of the ﬁnal one and the empty triangle to a small tumor,
whose mass is 10% of the ﬁnal one.

It is apparent from the ﬁgure that, according to GL, the surviving tumor cell fraction could be reduced ’ad libitum’,
simply by increasing the number of radio-therapeutic fractionated treatments, independently of the initial tumor mass
[1, 11].On the contrary, the UL establishes a lower limit for the survival fraction that cannot be reduced any further
regardless of the total number of treatments.

In particular, while in the ﬁrst half of the treatment only a small discrepancy is observed, approaching the ﬁnal
standard total dose of 70 Gy ( or 35 treatments) the predicted values for ln(S) by the UL law is almost 7 order of
magnitudes larger than expected by the GL. In other words, therapeutic control of tumor proliferation is poorer if
cellular regrowth follows UL instead of GL unless the total dose needed for eradication is small enough to be in the
range where Gl and UL predict the same value for S. Since such small doses are required only for very small tumors,
the UL may be able to explain the so called “tumor size eﬀect”, i.e. why the tumor control rate achieved by radiation
treatments alone rapidly declines for large tumors ( T3 or T4 or N2c/N3 in the clinical practice).

In order to stress the diﬀerent impact of GL and UL in the case of standard treatment for tumors of diﬀerent

volume, we computed P at diﬀerent number c of clonogens: 103, 105 and 107 respectively( Fig. 2)

As expected, while at low clonogen number c both growth laws predict the same control probability, at intermediate

c the therapy success is delayed and at large c is unattained .

The previous interesting clinical results are further investigated by considering the UL and the GL with diﬀerent
treatment schedules. In particular,since clinical experience conﬁrms that highly proliferative tumors are unsatisfac-
torily treated by conventional RT schedule, we have performed simulations by assuming non-conventional, yet widely
applied RT schedules, such as hyperfractionation [20], CHART protocol [21] and hypofractioned regimes [22], which
are known to be more eﬀective in controlling the evolution of highly proliferative tumors.

In ﬁgs 3, 5 and 7 are reported the values of the ﬁnal survival fraction ( in log scale) as a function of the number of
treatments for hypofractionation, hyperfractionation and CHART protocol by considering the regrowth according the
GL and the UL, when the initial observed tumor mass is respectively 1 and 10 percent of the asymptotic value (i.e.
the maximum size attainable from this speciﬁc tumor), i.e. Or = Nin/N∞ = 0.01, 0.1. The same shedules have been
investigated for cure probability assuming the tumor mass to be 10% of the ﬁnal one and clonogenic number equal to
103, 105 and 107. Figs 4, 6 and 8 are referred to hypofractionation, hyperfractionation and CHART respectively.

For Hypofractionation and CHART shedules almost the same results are obtained for s mall and intermediate c,
while complete therapeutic success can be achieved for tumors following the UL provided a larger number of treatments
is delivered. In the case on hyperfractionation, on the contrary, tumor following the UL cannot be satisfactorily treated
it c is large, and there is no advantage with respect to the standard schedule.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we compare the tumor survival fraction during RT regimen predicted by the Gomperz Law (GL) and
the Universal growth law (UL) , based on scaling principles. We note that the survival fraction, S,critically depends on
the tumor re-growth rate. According to GL, the surviving tumor cell fraction could be reduced ’ad libitum’, simply by
increasing the number of radio-therapeutic fractionated treatments, independently of the initial tumor mass [1, 11].On
the contrary, the UL establishes a lower limit for the survival fraction, weakly dependent on the clonogenic number,
that cannot be reduced any further regardless of the total number of treatments.

Two important considerations follows:
1) Predictions of tumor regrowth by GL and UL are very similar only in the initial part of the treatment, i.e. up
to around 25-30 Gy. In other words, only if the tumor mass is small enough to be cured by an overall dose delivered
by few treatments, both the GL and the UL predict similar outcomes.

Provided the number of clonogenic cells is accordingly small, a decrease of about 10 units in the ln(S) already
eradicates the tumor and RT reaches its goal independently on the actual re-growth curve followed by the tumor.
Results are no more satisfactory when larger tumors are irradiated, because, contrary to expectations relying on the
GL, ln(S) doesn’t decrease any more, and clonogenic cells are not deﬁnitively eliminated.

The “tumor size eﬀect” can be therefore understood on the basis of the UL. The dependence of the surviving
fraction on the tumor volume was already observed by Stanley et al in 1977 in lung tumors [23], and re-emphasized
by Bentzen et al and Huchet et al in [24, 25]. Larger tumors are expected to have a higher number of clonogenic
cells to be killed as well as a more hypoxic environment. Both factors aﬀect tumor regrowth as well as, possibly,
tumor radiosensitivity. While GL is volume-insensitive, UL accounts for the tumor growth stage, predicting diﬀerent
survival fractions after RT treatments.

Moreover, as far as the local control is concerned, this is qualitatively in agreement with the results for instance in

ln(S) vs the number of treatments when d = 5 Gy , t = 1 day and diﬀerent initial tumor mass, expressed as the

breast cancers treated by radiotherapy alone where the only two signiﬁcant factors determining treatment outcome
(control vs.
failure) are the overall dose and the tumor size [26]. Furthermore, a more recent analysis on breast
cancer [27] shows that, even in the presence of nodal involvement, tumor size does not lose its prognostic role, rather
it maintains its predominant eﬀect on mortality. It is noteworthy that in many pathologies the dose for 90% local
control is strictly related to tumor volume: for instances, in human malignant epithelial tumors, it ranges from 50Gy
for small lesions to 60Gy for linear dimensions < 2cm to 75Gy for large lesions (4 − 6 cm in min-max diameter).
Finally, rapid tumor re-growth during “long” (5−8wk) radio-therapeutic treatment is an important clinical parameter
[28] This fact re-emphasizes the importance of early shrinkage of the gross tumor mass, i.e. by surgical debulking prior
to radiation treatment, since it implies that radiotherapy may be successful provided the tumor mass at treatment
onset is rather small.

2) When larger tumors are considered, we would expect that, according to GL, therapeutic results depend on the
total delivered dose, independently on the actual schedule. Tumor regrowth according to the UL, on the contary,
shows a dependence on diﬀerent RT schedules.

Actually, clinical experience conﬁrms that highly proliferative tumors are unsatisfactorily treated by conventional
RT schedule. Simulations are therefore proposed by assuming non-conventional RT schedules such as accelerated
hyperfractionation [20], CHART protocol [21] and hypofractioned regimes [22].

Our simulation shows that for tumors following the UL law there is a therapeutic advantage is using Hypofraction-
ation and CHART schedules, since a complete success can be achieved even for large and/or very aggressive tumors
( c large), while hyperfractionation doesn’t improve results with respect to standard RT schedule.

As far as Hypofractionation and CHART are concerned, a good agreement between the model and the clinical results
is found, since both schedules are satisfactorily used in palliation and in treating advanced neoplasies. Regarding
hyper-fractionation, attention should be paid to the treatment details. The delivery of 0.8 Gy three time a day (’plain’
hyperfractionation) is actually performed with signiﬁcant improvements in local control and survival probability in

7

Figure 4: P vs the number of treatments when d = 5 Gy , t = 1.0 day and diﬀerent tumor clonogens number c

medium-size oropharingeal tumors [31]. Larger tumors are treated using a variety of schedules, such as the ’accelerated
hyperfractionation ( 1.5-1.6 Gy twice a day) ( there is evidence that for some tumors (inﬂammatory breast cancer
[30], head and neck cancer [32]) standard RT treatment may be accelerated with beneﬁt) ,or using the so-called
’concomitant boost’ (by adding 1.2 Gy each day in the second and ﬁfht weeks of treatment). The main concern in
increasing the radiation dose is its impact on healthy tissue which should be spared as much as possible. The goal
however can nowadays be achieved by 3D conformal radiotherapy in all its techniques (3DCRT, IMRT, Stereotactic
treatment) allowing larger doses to be used. Recently these two options (accelerated fractionation and IMRT) are
been used together in a particular in the SMART (simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy) [33] or SIB
(Simultaneous Integrated boost) [34]. Investigating all the above options is quite demanding, so they will be targeted
in a following paper.

Since there is clinical evidence for better responses to some non-conventional schedules of large tumors, such as
hypofractionation and CHART, the UL model may be more appropriate to account for tumor regrowth of highly
proliferating tumors during RT, and may help to logically explain clinical results.

Up to now, also the aforementioned RT regimens have not yet been investigated exhaustively with theoretical
models and, to our knowledge a comparison between diﬀerent growing tumors and/or diﬀerent RT schedules is still
missing. We think that, as for the tumor size eﬀect, the Universal Law can help in understanding the experimental
data not explained by the Gompertz law.

APPENDIX

Let us consider that an ’in vivo’ tumor, with Nin initial cells, is irradiated at t = 0 with a dose d which istantaneously

produces a survival fraction S0, i.e.

N (0) = Nin exp [−(αd + βd2)] = NinS0

One can easily shows that, after n equal treatment, the ﬁnal survival fraction, Sg = N (t)/Nin, for the Gompertz

pattern turns out to be:

with m = n − 1.

The costant σ is small ( σ ≃ 0.42) g1/4/month and τ is typically between 1-2 days. Therefore, for a typical dose of

which is independ on Nin, on N∞ and depends only on the dose, on the interval between treatments and on the

principle, always) reduce the ﬁnal survival fraction by increasing the number of treatments. Indeed, according to
GL the ﬁnal survival fraction is practically independent on Nin and can be continuously decreased by increasing the
number of treatments. For the UL there is a dependence on the initial cell number but there is no way, at ﬁxed d and
τ , to decrease Pasy beyond its asymptotic value.

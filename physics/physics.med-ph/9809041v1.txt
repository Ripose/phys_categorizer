Abstract

A method is proposed to analyze the heartbeat waveform that can yield a reliable

characterization of the structure after only a few pulses. The measure suggested is

entropy index that is related to the one found eﬀective in describing chaotic behaviors

in a wide variety of physical systems. When applied to the ECG data that include

ventricular ﬁbrillation, the index is shown to change drastically within a few pulses.

Wavelet analysis is used to exhibit diﬀerent scaling behaviors in diﬀerent phases.

Concepts from the theory of nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics have been applied

to the study of nonstationary time series, such as human heartbeats [1, 2, 3, 4] and brain

electrical activities[5, 6]. Those analyses generally involve the use of data recorded over a

long period of time. In this paper we propose a method of analysis that needs only a short

duration of the time series data, as short as, say, ten heartbeats, for example. Conceptually,

1

the method is interesting because the proposed measure is related to the study of ﬂuctuations

in a diverse range of physical problems, e.g., hadron production in high-energy collisions [7, 8],

classical chaotic systems [9], and phase transition [10]. The underlying universality in all

those applications is rooted in the attempt to quantify the ﬂuctuations of spatial patterns,

for which an eﬀective measure found is the entropy index [7, 9]. The application to the

ECG time series, as we shall discuss here, provides a diagnostic tool that is both simple and

eﬃcient.

A major eﬀort initiated by physicists to analyze the human heartbeat time series is to

study the ﬂuctuation of time intervals between the R pulses. The study of such ﬂuctuations

is motivated by the possible analogy with critical behaviors in statistical systems, where

ﬂuctuations at all length (time) scales occur. While that is certainly an interesting area of

investigation, the data required run in excess of 104 heartbeats [3, 4]. There are, however, a

great deal of information about the heartbeat time series that is discarded when the focus

is only on the interbeat time intervals. As is well known, the structure of the time series

between beats changes drastically when a heart goes into ﬁbrillation [11]. The question

is how to quantify that structure in an eﬃcient manner so that the numerical value of an

appropriate measure can be determined after a few beats. Of course, there is no need for

such a measure if one has at hand the data for both before and during ﬁbrillation, anymore

than the need for a smoke detector when a house is actually on ﬁre. However, the availability

of a numerical measure of the cardiac activity is clearly a useful tool, especially for patients

with irregular behaviors of the heart.

The analysis that we propose has its origin in the study of spatial patterns associated

with the ﬁnal state of particles in momentum space detected at the end of each event in high-

2

energy collisions [7]. For each event the factorial moments are used to describe the pattern;

those moments have the virtue of ﬁltering out the statistical ﬂuctuations [12]. The nature of

the ﬂuctuations of those moments from event to event is quantiﬁed by an index µ, which is

larger when the ﬂuctuation is larger. For a heartbeat time series, we partition it into many

segments of short duration (e.g., 2 sec), regard each segment as a pattern, and characterize

each pattern by studying the ﬂuctuations from bin to bin. Since statistical ﬂuctuation does

not have the same meaning in the heartbeat problem as for particle production, we shall not

use the factorial moments. In their place we shall employ the wavelet analysis [13, 14, 15],

which is natural for a problem that has sharp spikes and low bumps. The corresponding

entropy index is then a measure of the ﬂuctuation of the normalized wavelet coeﬃcients at

various scales of resolution.

In Fig. 1 we show the digitized electrocardiogram data that we shall analyze. The data

were provided by Minh [16], recorded at the Stanford University Medical School, when a

patient’s heart went into ventricular ﬁbrillation, followed by a deﬁbrillation process. The

three phases (normal, abnormal and recovery) are clearly identiﬁable visually in Fig. 1. In

Fig. 2 are shown in more detail the structures between the pulses in the normal and abnormal

phases. Evidently, the minor peaks and dips between the major spikes (called R “waves”

[11]) behave very diﬀerently in the two phases. To capture and characterize those diﬀerences

is therefore our task.

In the digitized data of Fig. 1 there are roughly 240 points between two successive R

pulses in the normal phase, which spans about 3600 points. There are approximately 2500

points in the abnormal phase. Given the data, we divide the time series into segments of

512 points each, calling each segment Sn, with n = 1, · · · , 7 belonging to the normal phase,

3

n = 8, · · · 12 to the abnormal phase, and the rest n = 13, · · · , 16 to the recovery phase.

The number of segments in a particular phase is not important, since the ﬂuctuation of the

patterns from segment to segment within a phase is not large. Thus for an ordinary time

series that does not include a change of phase, one may have only 10 - 20 heartbeats in a

diagnostic test. That should be suﬃcient for the proposed analysis to be performed.

Note that each segment has 29 points. The importance of that number to be an integer

power of 2 will become self-evident, as we perform the wavelet analysis whose resolution

improves by powers of 2. To have more points in a longer segment will not improve the

analysis because the information to be extracted lies with the shape of the waveform between

and around the pulses. To have less points would shorten the range of resolutions and inhibit

the establishment of a convincing scaling behavior.

Let the Haar wavelet ψH

jk(t) be deﬁned by

jk(t) = ψH
ψH

2jt − k

,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(1)

(2)

where ψH(t) = 1 for 0 ≤ t < 1/2, = −1 for 1/2 ≤ t < 1, and = 0 otherwise. For any scalar

function f (t) deﬁned in 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the wavelet coeﬃcient after a discrete wavelet transform

is

wjk =

ψH

jk, f

(cid:16)

=

Z

(cid:17)

dt ψH

jk(t)f (t)

.

By virtue of the properties of ψH

jk(t), which is zero for t outside the interval [k2−j, (k + 1)2−j] ,

wjk selects a narrow sector of f (t) that depends on the scale factor j and shift variable k.

Thus with appropriate values of j and k, wjk can identify spikes in f (t).

We use (2) to analyze the waveforms of various segments Sn of our ECG time series

separately. Since each segment has 512 points, we consider the range of j values from 0 to

4

8, so that at the highest resolution two neighboring points are resolved by the transform.

The shift k can vary from 0 to 2j − 1. For the purpose of our use of the wavelet coeﬃcients

below, we want to avoid negative values by taking the absolute value of the transform, i.e.,

for the nth segment,

where we have mapped the 512 points on the time axis to the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. With the

deﬁnition in (3), the average (over all k at ﬁxed j)

is always positive deﬁnite. We now can deﬁne a normalized wavelet coeﬃcient

which measures the ﬂuctuation of w(n)

jk from the average. This is an important step that com-

bines both the local and global properties of the waveform in a segment, since z(n)

jk is sensitive

to the values of w(n)

jk in all bins. Moreover, note that in the ratio (5) the normalization of

the Haar wavelet ψH

jk(t) deﬁned in (1) is unimportant.

In order to quantify the ﬂuctuations of z(n)

jk from bin to bin, we now deﬁne

where the angular brackets denote an average over k as deﬁned in (4). K (n)

is not far from

j

being the entropy. If we deﬁne p(n)

jk = 2−jz(n)

jk with

k p(n)

jk = 1, we can deﬁne the entropy as

w(n)

It then follows that

j = jln 2 − K (n)

In the study of problems of this type that have ﬂuctuations at all scales, we look for

scaling behavior as an organizing feature. The quantities that are expected to possess scaling

behaviors are the moments

where the dependence on j may be expressed in terms of the number of bins, M, via M = 2j.

Clearly, we have from (6)

(cid:12)

p (M) ∝ M ψ(n)

,

Thus, if C (n)

p has the scaling behavior

as the resolution is increased (i.e., higher M), then it follows from (10) and (11) that

K (n)

j ∝ µ(n)ln M = µ(n)jln 2 ,

where µ(n) = d

. Our entropy index is deﬁned by

dpψ(n)
p (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

p=1

σ(n) = 1 − µ(n)

,

which follows naturally from (8) and (12).

The procedure for analyzing the data should now be clear and straightforward. For each

segment Sn, use (3) - (6) to determine K (n)

j

for j = 0, · · · , 8. As an illustration of the result,

(12)

(13)

we show in Fig. 3 K (n)

vs n for j = 8. Evidently, K (n)

8

8

is quite stationary at around 2.1 for

n = 1, · · · , 7, which are the segments in the normal phase. Then at n = 8, K (n)

8 drops down

to below 1 and stays below for the remaining segments of the abnormal phase, n = 8, · · · , 12.

The ﬂuctuations from segment to segment are not signiﬁcant within one or the other of

the two phases. Since j = 8 is the highest resolution that the data allow, it provides the

most dramatic changes of K (n)

j

in the transitions between phases. At lower j the spikes in

the waveform are smeared by the wavelet transform, with the consequence that the changes

in K (n)

j

between phases become less pronounced. In that sense K (n)

itself can serve as a

8

measure of cardiac regularity.

To capture the information contained in K (n)

j

at lower j, we investigate the scaling be-

havior (11), which implies a linear dependence of K (n)

j

on j, as given in (12). To have an

average measure over all segments in a particular phase, we deﬁne the following averages

K N

for the normal and abnormal phases, respectively. Beginning with n = 13, the recovery

phase commences. Since K (n)

j

in the recovery phase is time dependent, a similar average is

less meaningful, although it can analogously be deﬁned. In Fig. 4 we show K N

j and K A

j vs

j, which clearly exhibit linear behavior. The straightline ﬁts give

Their numerical values obtained are µN = 0.54 and µA = 0.12. The corresponding values of

the entropy indices are then

σN = 0.46,

σA = 0.88.

(16)

7

If the same procedure is followed for the recovery phase, the corresponding entropy index is

σR = 0.58, which is a coarse summary of the transitory change from σA back to σN . Eq.

(16) exhibits the numerical result of this work. Whereas σA may vary, depending on the

nature of the cardiac abnormality, σN = 0.46 can be regarded as the standard number for a

normal heartbeat. To register the state of cardiac health in terms of σ is clearly useful.

The increase of σ in the transition from the normal to abnormal phase signiﬁes the

increase of disorder in the waveform. That is a feature that is visually obvious from Figs.

1 and 2. We now have a quantitative measure of that disorder. In the normal phase the

ﬂuctuation from bin to bin is relatively small despite the large, but regular, spikes, whereas

the irregularity in the abnormal phase generates large ﬂuctuations.

It is pertinent to remark that from the ﬂuctuations of beat-to-beat intervals studied

over very long periods it has been inferred that the normal heartbeat is chaotic [17]. Since

stochastic disorder is not the same as chaotic behavior, there is no obvious conﬂict between

that conclusion and ours. Nevertheless, it would be useful to point out here the possible

source of the diﬀerence in interpretations. Because the emphasis in this paper is on the

characterization of ECG waveforms in short periods, we have considered only a few segments

with detailed analysis of the bin-to-bin ﬂuctuations. To study chaotic behavior, we would

have to consider segment-to-segment ﬂuctuations over a long period. That happens to be

the type of analysis done earlier with the µ index (for event-to-event ﬂuctuations) for both

classical-chaotic time series [9] and quantum systems involving particle production [7]. In

fact, it was found that µ can play the role of the Lyapunov exponent. Applying similar

method to data collected over very long periods, it should be possible to make more elaborate

analysis, not just on the beat-to-beat intervals, but on the ﬂuctuation of the interpulse

8

structure.

To illuminate the dual properties of stochasticity and chaoticity would be highly inter-

esting. Here we present only the method of analysis that can quantify the disorder aspect

of the ECG waveform structure. Multichannel analysis and ﬁnding predictive signatures in

correlated data are examples of other problems well worth further investigation.

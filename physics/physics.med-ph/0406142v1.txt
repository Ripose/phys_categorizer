of the Leksell Gamma Knifer: testing
multisource conﬁgurations with PENELOPE

A simpliﬁcation of the source channel geometry of the Leksell Gamma Knifer, recently
proposed by the authors and checked for a single source conﬁguration (Al-Dweri et al 2004),
has been used to calculate the dose distributions along the x, y and z axes in a water phantom
with a diameter of 160 mm, for diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the Gamma Knife including 201, 150
and 102 unplugged sources. The code PENELOPE (v. 2001) has been used to perform the
Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the output factors for the 14, 8 and 4 mm helmets have
been calculated. The results found for the dose proﬁles show a qualitatively good agreement
with previous ones obtained with EGS4 and PENELOPE (v. 2000) codes and with the
predictions of GammaPlanr. The output factors obtained with our model agree within the
statistical uncertainties with those calculated with the same Monte Carlo codes and with
those measured with diﬀerent techniques. Owing to the accuracy of the results obtained and
to the reduction in the computational time with respect to full geometry simulations (larger
than a factor 15), this simpliﬁed model opens the possibility to use Monte Carlo tools for
planning purposes in the Gamma Knifer.

1. Introduction

Leksell Gamma Knifer (GK) is a high precision device designed to perform radiosurgery
of brain lesions. It uses the radiation generated by 201 60Co sources in such a way that a
high dose can be deposited into the target volume with an accuracy better than 0.3 mm
(Elekta 1992), while the critical brain structures surrounding the lesion to be treated can be
maintained under low dose rates. The four treatment helmets available together with the
possibility to block individual sources permit to establish optimal dose distributions. These
are determined by means of the GammaPlanr (GP), the computer-based treatment planning
system accompanying GK units (Elekta 1996).

To ensure GP quality, and due to the usual diﬃculties in measuring the physical doses,
Monte Carlo (MC) calculations have played a relevant role as a complementary tool. Most of
the simulations performed (Cheung et al 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000, Xiaowei and Chunxiang
1999, Moskvin et al 2002) have pointed out a good agreement with the GP predictions in the
case of a homogeneous phantom. However, diﬀerences reaching 25% are found for phantoms
with inhomogeneities, near tissue interfaces and dose edges (Cheung et al 2001).

In a recent paper (Al-Dweri et al 2004), we have proposed a simpliﬁed model of the
source channel of the GK. This model is based on the characteristics shown by the beams
after they pass trough the treatment helmets. In particular, the photons trajectories, reaching
the output helmet collimators at a given point (x, y, z), show strong correlations between
ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2 and their polar angle θ, on one side, and between tan−1(y/x) and their
azimuthal angle φ, on the other. This permits to substitute the full source channel by a point
source, situated at the center of the active core of the GK source, which emits photons inside
the cone deﬁned by itself and the output helmet collimators. This simpliﬁed model produces
doses in agreement with those found if the full geometry of the source channel is considered
(Al-Dweri et al 2004).

In this work we want to complete the test of this simpliﬁed model by calculating the dose
distributions in a water phantom which is irradiated by a GK unit with diﬀerent multisource
conﬁgurations. The version 2001 of the code PENELOPE (Salvat et al 2001) has been
used to perform the Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the dose proﬁles around the
isocenter of the GK, the output factors for the 4, 8 and 14 mm helmets have been obtained.
Our ﬁndings have been compared with various results obtained with other MC codes, such
as EGS4 (Cheung et al 1999a, 1999b, 2000, Xiaowei and Chunxiang 1999) or PENELOPE
(Moskvin et al 2002), predicted with GP (Elekta 1992, 1998) or measured with diﬀerent
techniques (Ma et al 2000, Tsai et al 2003).

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Leksell Gamma Knifer model

Figure 1 shows a scheme of the simpliﬁed model of the source channel of the GK. It consists
in a point source emitting the initial photons in the cone deﬁned by itself and the helmet
outer collimators, whose apertures a are given in table 1, together with the maximum polar
angle, θmax, corresponding to each helmet. The water phantom is a sphere with 80 mm of
radius. It simulates the patient head and its center coincides with the isocenter of the GK.
This simpliﬁed geometry has been considered for all the 201 source channels of the GK.
Figure 2 shows a scheme of the situation of these sources. In the upper panel, the reference
system we have considered is indicated. The origin of coordinates is situated at the isocenter

panel shows the disposal of the ﬁve rings in which the sources are distributed as well as the
elevation angles of each one with respect to the isocenter plane. There are 44 sources in rings
A and B, 39 in rings C and D and 35 in ring E. Table 2 shows the spherical coordinates of
the 201 point sources. All of them have r = 401 mm. On the other hand, the angles φ for

It should be noted that the distribution of the sources in the rings is not completely
uniform because some of them are not present (for example those labeled A7, B7, C6, D6,
E5, etc.) and this breaks the cylindrical symmetry of the system. Thus, the doses we have

calculated depend on the three cartesian coordinates, D(x, y, z). The scoring voxels we have
used present ∆x =0.5 mm and ∆y = ∆z = 1 mm, for the 18 and 14 mm helmets, and
∆x =0.25 mm and ∆y = ∆z =0.5 mm, for the 8 and 4 mm ones.

In connection with this point, we have studied the asymmetry between x and y axes, by

and, also, the asymmetries between the negative and positive parts of the x axis,

calculating the quantity

Axy(s) =

D(s, 0, 0) − D(0, s, 0)

,

and of the y axis,

, s ≥ 0 ,

Ay(s) =

D(0, s, 0) − D(0, −s, 0)
D(0, s, 0)

, s ≥ 0 .

In these calculations we have considered the conﬁguration in which the 201 sources
are unplugged. In addition, conﬁgurations with 150 and 102 sources have been considered.
Figure 3 shows the corresponding plug patterns taken into account. Therein, the black circles
represent the plugged sources.

We have also calculated the dose output factors for the conﬁguration with 201 sources.
These are deﬁned as the dose rate for a given collimator helmet, relative to that of the
18 mm helmet, at the isocenter, in presence of the phantom. To accumulate the energy,
we have considered two kind of voxel centered at the isocenter. First, we have assumed a
cubic voxel with dimensions (2∆x, 2∆y, 2∆z), with ∆x, ∆y and ∆z equal to the values given
above for the scoring voxels. This corresponds to take the eight scoring voxels surrounding
the isocenter as a unique voxel. Second, we have considered three spherical voxels with radii
0.5, 0.75 and 1 mm.

To calculate the output factors, the doses obtained have been renormalized to the case

of a point source emitting isotropically,

Dnorm(x, y, z) = fnorm D(x, y, z) ,

where the normalization factor is

fnorm =

1 − cos θmax

,

with the corresponding θmax for each helmet.

2.2. Monte Carlo calculations

2001) (Salvat et al 2001) to perform the
In this work we have used PENELOPE (v.
calculations. PENELOPE is a general purpose MC code which permits the simulation of
the coupled electron-photon transport. The energy range in which it can be applied goes
from a few hundred eV up to 1 GeV, for arbitrary materials. PENELOPE describes in an
accurate way the particle transport near interfaces.

PENELOPE performs analog simulation for photons and uses a mixed scheme for
electrons and positrons. In this case, events are classiﬁed as hard (which are simulated in
detail and are characterized by polar angular deﬂections or energy losses larger than certain
cutoﬀ values) and soft (which are described in terms of a condensed simulation based on a
multiple scattering theory). Details can be found in Salvat et al (2001). The full tracking is
controlled by means of ﬁve parameters. C1, C2, Wcc, Wcr and smax. Besides the absorption
energies for the diﬀerent particles must be supplied. Table 3 shows the values we have
assumed in our simulations for these parameters and for the two materials (air and water)
present in the geometry.

Initial photons were emitted with the average energy 1.25 MeV. For each history in the
simulation, a source was selected by sampling uniformly between the unplugged sources in the
conﬁguration analyzed. This determines the coordinates of the initial photon and the beam
axis direction. Then the initial photon is emitted uniformly in the corresponding emission
cone as deﬁned in the simpliﬁed geometry.

The number of histories simulated has been chosen in each case to maintain the
statistical uncertainties under reasonable levels. The uncertainties given throughout the
paper correspond to 1σ.

The simulation geometry has been described by means of the geometrical package
PENGEOM of PENELOPE. Table 4 gives the composition and densities of the two materials
(air and water) assumed in our simulations.

To give an idea of the time needed to perform the simulations discussed below, we can
say that it takes 11.2 minutes of CPU for each 106 histories in a Origin 3400 of Silicon
Graphics with a CPU R14000A at 600 MHz. In a PC with a CPU AMD Athlon XP 1800+
at 1600 Mhz the time needed is 16.6 minutes.

3. Results

In our ﬁrst calculation, the conﬁguration in which all the 201 sources are unplugged has been
considered (see ﬁgure 2). A total of 15 · 107 histories have been followed.

Figures 4 and 5 show the dose proﬁles at the isocenter, D(x, 0, 0) (upper panel) and
D(0, 0, z) (lower panel), relative to their respective maxima, in percentage, for the 18 and
4 mm helmets, respectively. The results of our simulations (squares) are compared with those
obtained with EGS4 by Xiaowei and Chunxiang (1999) (dotted curves), with PENELOPE (v.
2000) by Moskvin et al (2002) (dashed curves) and with the predictions of GP (Moskvin et al
2002) (solid curves). The values quoted by Moskvin et al (2002) correspond to a polystyrene
phantom.

For the 18 mm helmet (ﬁgure 4), we found a good agreement with the PENELOPE
results of Moskvin et al (2002) and with those predicted by GP. Some diﬀerences with the
calculation of Xiaowei and Chunxiang (1999) appear at the ending edges of the plateau of the
maximum dose. For the 4 mm helmet (ﬁgure 5), the agreement with the GP predictions is
rather good, while some discrepancies are observed with the other calculations, mainly for the

z proﬁle (lower panel). Part of the disagreement with the PENELOPE results of Moskvin et
al (2002) can be ascribed to the diﬀerence in the material forming the phantom (polystyrene
in the case of these authors).

Due to lack of cylindrical symmetry shown by the source system of the GK, an interesting
point to address concerns the asymmetry shown by the dose proﬁles. First, we have studied
the asymmetry between x and y axes by means of Axy as given by equation (1).
In the
upper panel of ﬁgure 6, we show the values obtained for the 18 mm treatment helmet. The
shadow regions indicate the s values for which the corresponding dose D(s, 0, 0) is larger than
20% (clearer) and 50% (darker) of the maximum dose, [D(s, 0, 0)]max. As we can see, the
asymmetry is below 15% in absolute value for all s. This percentage reduces to around 5%
and 2% in the two marked regions.

Also, we have determined for the same helmet, the asymmetries between the negative

and positive parts of the x axis, Ax (see equation (2)) and of the y axis, Ay (see equation
(3)). Results are plotted in the lower panels of ﬁgure 6, where the shadow regions have the
same meaning mentioned above. Similar comments to those done for Axy can be stated in
both cases. We have checked that the situation is the same for the remaining three helmets.
The conclusion is that the loss of cylindrical symmetry in the GK, provoked by the absence
of some source channels, has a rather slight eﬀect on the dose proﬁles at the isocenter. These
proﬁles show up cylindrical symmetry in practice.

As a second test of our simpliﬁed model, we have performed new simulations, in similar
conditions to those of the previous conﬁguration, but plugging 51 and 99 sources, as indicated
in the schemes of ﬁgure 3.

In ﬁgures 7 and 8 we compare our results for the 4 mm helmet (squares) with those
of Cheung et al (1999a) obtained with EGS4 (dashed curve) and with the GP predictions
quoted by the same authors (solid curves). The three proﬁles along x (upper panels), y
(medium panels) and z (lower panels) axes are shown. As we can see, our results show a very
good agreement with those obtained with EGS4. On the other hand, as in the case of the
201 source conﬁguration, the agreement with the GP predictions is rather good.

As for the case of a single source (Al-Dweri et al (2004)), the simpliﬁed model of the
source channel produces dose proﬁles which are in good agreement with other MC calculations
and with the GP predictions. This ensures the feasibility of the simpliﬁed geometry model,

The shadow areas mark the s values for which the dose D(s, 0, 0) is larger than 20%
(clearer area) and 50% (darker area) of the maximum dose [D(s, 0, 0)]max.

which, in addition, permits a large reduction in the computation time (larger than a factor
15) with respect to the calculations with the full geometry.

Finally, we have calculated the dose output factors for the conﬁguration with 201 sources.
First, we have performed the calculations using the cubic voxel described in section 2.1. In
table 5 we compare the results we have obtained (see ﬁrst row labeled “this work”) with those
found by other authors by means of MC simulations or diﬀerent measurement procedures.
Our results are in good agreement with the ﬁndings of the other authors in case of the
4 mm helmet. The value we have obtained for the 8 mm helmet agrees within the statistical
uncertainties with the one quoted by Cheung et al (1999b), but it is noticeably larger than
those of Elekta (1992) and Moskvin et al (2002). Finally, for the 14 mm helmet, our result
agrees with those of Cheung et al (1999b) and the manufacturer (Elekta 1992), but diﬀers
(at the 1σ level) from that of Moskvin et al (2002).

Out of the discrepancies noted, the most signiﬁcant are those found with the calculations
of Moskvin et al (2002). These authors have used the version 2000 of PENELOPE code,
but the diﬀerences between this version and the 2001 we have used are not expected to
produce such discrepancies. This is corroborated by the good agreement we have found when
comparing the dose proﬁles discussed above.

In order to clarify this disagreement, we have investigated if it is due to diﬀerences in
the scoring voxels chosen for the calculations. Moskvin et al (2002) considered a spherical
voxel with radius 0.75 mm. Thus we have performed new simulations, following 2 · 108
histories, and using the spherical voxels described in section 2.1. The results are shown in
the last three rows of table 5. As we can see, there are not signiﬁcant variations (within
the statistical uncertainties) when the radius of the voxel is reduced. On the other hand,

in our calculations. The average value quoted by Tsai et al (2003) corresponds to a
pool of measurements done with silicon diode, diamond detector, radiographic ﬁlm,
radiochromic ﬁlm, and TLD cubes. The values of Moskvin et al (2002) were obtained
with a spherical voxel of R =0.75 mm using a polystyrene phantom. The values we
have obtained correspond to the cubic voxel described in the text (ﬁrst row) and to
spherical voxels with radii 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mm. In these three last cases a total of
2 · 108 histories have been followed.

the results obtained for these spherical voxels are into agreement with the values quoted by
Moskvin et al (2002). This points out a dependence of the dose output factors with the shape
of the scoring voxel.

4. Conclusions

In this work we have investigated the dosimetry of the GK by considering a simpliﬁed model
for the single source channels. Calculations have been done by using the Monte Carlo code
PENELOPE (v. 2001) for diﬀerent conﬁgurations including 201, 150 and 102 unplugged
sources.

The use of the simpliﬁed model produce results for the dose proﬁles at the isocenter
which are into agreement with previous calculations done with other MC codes and with the
predictions of the GP. The absence of cylindrical geometry due to the lack of some source
channels in the GK does not show up in the calculated dose proﬁles.

Besides, we have determined the dose output factors corresponding to the 14, 8 and
4 mm helmets. The results found show a good agreement with those obtained with EGS4 and
measured by means of diﬀerent procedures, mainly for the 4 mm helmet. The discrepancies
observed with previous results obtained also with PENELOPE are largely reduced once one
uses scoring voxels with the same shape. This voxel shape dependence deserves a deeper
investigation which we are carrying out at present.

The results quoted here, together with those found for the single source conﬁguration
(Al-Dweri et al 2004), prove the suitability of the simpliﬁed geometry proposed to perform
dosimetry calculations for the GK. The simplicity of this model and the level of accuracy
which can be obtained by using it opens the possibility to use MC tools for planning purposes
in the GK, mainly if we take into account the reduction in the computational time (around
a factor 15) with respect to the full geometry simulations. As an additional gain, MC
simulations permit to take into account the presence of inhomogeneities and interfaces in
the target geometry, which are not correctly treated by GP.

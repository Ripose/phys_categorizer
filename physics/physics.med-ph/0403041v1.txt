Abstrat. Our interest has been to study the e(cid:27)et that sattered radiation

has on ontrast , signal-to-noise ratio and thikness reonstrution in digital

mammographies. Using the GEANT ode we have performed Monte-Carlo

simulations of 25 kVp Mo/Mo photons, through a breast phantom whih ontains a

0.2-1.0 mm thik miroali(cid:28)ations inident on a 20x106 mm2

pixelized detetor.

The data have been analyzed assuming 6 di(cid:27)erent shapes of the inident beam:

a 0.2x0.2 mm2
widths, and a 20x100 mm2

(cid:16)narrow(cid:17) beam, 4 di(cid:27)erent 20 mm long sanning beams of various

beam with no satter redution mehanisms (N SR)

. Sine the image of a point depends on sattered photons whih passed up to 2

m away from the ob jet (for 4 m thik phantom), we identify the bakground

de(cid:28)nition as a main soure of systemati unertainty in the image quality analysis.

We propose the use of two dimensional funtions (a polynomial for the bakground

and Gaussians for the signal) for total photon transmission desription. Our main

results indiate the possible ali(cid:28)ation thikness reonstrution with an auray

of the order of 6% using 3 mm wide sanning beam. Signal-to-noise ratio with

the 3 mm wide beam gets improved by 20% with respet to N SR, a (cid:28)gure similar

to that obtained with the narrow beam. Thikness reonstrution is shown to be

an alternative to signal-to-noise ratio for miroali(cid:28)ation detetion.

1. Introdution

One of the main limitations of image reonstrution in mammography, independent of

external geometry and total breast thikness, is the in(cid:29)uene of sattered photons. The

main parameter used to desribe sattered photon ontributions is satter-to primary

radiation ratio (SPR), whih has been measured[1℄ and alulated [2℄, and is ∼

−

for typial voltages and breast phantom dimensions. The presene at the image

0.5

0.6

reeptor of photons whih have been sattered by the breast tissue omponents results

in a severe loss of ontrast. The ontrast redution is estimated to be about ∼0.6 for

the above SPR, and the range of values enountered in mammography indiates that

the ontrast an be improved by fators of ∼1.4 - 2.5 if sattered radiation is eliminated

from the image [3℄. The most popular solution for the problem has been the use of

antisatter grids in mammography units [4℄. These improve the ontrast by typial

fators of ∼1.2 - 1.4 but also redue the primary intensity, resulting in a patient dose

inrease of approximately 2 for typial mammographi onditions [4℄ in order to reah

the neessary photon (cid:29)uene for a good quality image. Lately, the use of sanning

narrow beams [5, 6℄, a diret way to redue the volume of the irradiated sattering

medium, has found its way into ommerial mammographi systems.

Mammographi systems using digital detetors o(cid:27)er distint advantages with

respet to the onventional sreen/(cid:28)lm image reorder due to their muh wider

dynamial range of useful exposures. Sine the response of the detetor is linear

over some 4 orders of magnitude in exposure, there is no need to inrease exposure

if sattering redution methods are used, and the signal detetion limit is dominated

by the signal-to-noise ratio (SN R) [7℄. Another parameter whih an be used to

evaluate the digital image quality is the linear size of the ob jet along the photon

diretion, as evaluated from the image. This thikness an be determined by using the

visual ontrast (VC) [8℄ and the linear absorption oe(cid:30)ients. Clinially, the orret

determination of this parameter, for instane, a miroali(cid:28)ation (µC) thikness, an

be an indiator of the stage of development of this formation. Though we onsider

the thikness parameter to be of more evident and real harater than the ontrast,

it is neessary to determine whih of these two is more sensitive, both for the miro-

ali(cid:28)ation detetion and its study as well.

In this work we have performed Monte Carlo (M-C) simulations of the passing

of photons through a breast phantom whih ontains a few µC of di(cid:27)erent thikness
inside. The in(cid:29)uene of the sattered photons on the ontrast, SN R and thikness

determination has been studied for a variety of inident beam de(cid:28)nitions, using a

sanning slit as the satter redution tehnique.

2. The model

At least two X-ray transmission measurements are neessary to reover eah of the

omponents of a simulated three-omponent breast (miroali(cid:28)ation, adipose and

glandular tissue), if the total thikness is known[11℄. This task an be onsiderably

simpli(cid:28)ed under the assumption that one of the omponents has onstant thikness;

this will lead to a two-omponent model, for whih one measurement is enough. The

phantom proposed in this work assumes that miroali(cid:28)ations are embedded in

the glandular tissue, and that onstant-thikness adipose tissue overs the outside

of the breast. The geometry and the struture of the proposed breast phantom

model is shown in Fig. 1. The phantom, with lateral dimensions 10x10 cm2

, has

Miroali(cid:28)ation thikness determination

3

a total thikness of 4 cm. Two adipose layers over the top and bottom sides with

a total thikness of 1 m, and 3 m thik glandular tissue is loated between the

adipose layers. Five µC are loated at the midplane of the glandular tissue layer.

The miroali(cid:28)ations are ylindrial in shape, 4 mm diameter, and have variable

thiknesses between 0.2 and 1.0 mm. The seletion of a 25 perent adipose omponent

is done for the purpose of inreasing the relative ontribution of the noise[11℄. The

detailed hemial ompositions of the phantom materials are presented in table 1. All

estimates, and the M-C simulations, have been arried out with this simpli(cid:28)ed model

of the breast.

In order to understand the di(cid:30)ulties to reover the µC dimensions from a

radiologial image,

let us ondut some estimations for mono-energeti photons,

negleting the e(cid:27)ets of sattering.

In the absene of µC , the number of photons
passing through the phantom (Nnc(x, y)) is de(cid:28)ned through the total number of
N0(x, y) primary photons as:

Nnc(x, y) = N0(x, y) exp(

µata(x, y)

µgtg(x, y)),

−

−

(1)

where µa and µg are the linear absorption oe(cid:30)ients, and ta and tg are the
thikness of the adipose and glandular tissues, respetively. With the addition of µC ,

Eqn. (1) transforms into:

Nc(x, y) = N0(x, y) exp(

µata(x, y)

µgtc

g(x, y)

µctc(x, y)),

(2)

−

−

−

where µc is the miroali(cid:28)ation linear attenuation oe(cid:30)ient, and tc(x, y) is
its thikness. Nc(x, y) is the number of the transmitted photons in the presene of
ali(cid:28)ations. Within our simpli(cid:28)ed model, tc

g(x, y) will be de(cid:28)ned as:

tc
g(x, y) = tg(x, y)

tc(x, y).

−

Dividing Eqn. (1) into (2) and taking logarithms, we obtain the following for the

µC thikness tc :

tc(x, y) = D

−1
µ log(Nnc(x, y)/Nc(x, y)),

where Dµ = µc

µg . To be orret, linear attenuation oe(cid:30)ients suh as those in

−

the NIST data base, should be used only for the narrow-beam ondition[13℄ sine they

do not inlude the e(cid:27)et of the satter radiation. Thus, within this approximation, the

µC thikness an be easily determined by one measurement in whih the value of Nnc

is determined from the region outside the miroali(cid:28)ation. However, in reality, the

determination of Nnc is only approximate beause the e(cid:27)ets of sattering, geometry

and the inner struture of the breast tissue an introdue several inauraies.

The ontrast parameter, traditionally used in onventional mammography, is

useless in digital mammography sine the possibility of deteting the signal depends

on the SN R[7℄, de(cid:28)ned as:

SN R = (Nnc

Nc)/

Nnc + Nc.

The important question is the hoie of the most appropriate parameter to use

for the aomplishment of the image quality optimization.

Let us ompare SN R and µC thikness to determine whih one is more sensitive
for the detetion of the µC . The ratio R, between the relative errors in the

determination of eah parameter, is:

where σtc and σSN R are the unertainties in the determination of thikness and
SN R, respetively, tc and SN R are given by Eq 4 and 5, respetively, and m = Nc/Nnc
. When m

and the relative unertainties of both parameters have idential statistial behavior,

1/√Nnc . On the other hand, in ase of a given (cid:29)uene, the statistis are proportional

∼

to the ob jet surfae so the relative statistial unertainty in the ob jet image will

depend on 1/r, where r is the ob jet linear size. Consequently, the measurement of
the µC thikness is not less sensitive than measuring the SN R or ontrast in the
detetion of the µC and, at the same time, makes possible to restore the µC three

dimensions.

Everything stated above is orret in the absene of sattering. After swithing

sattering on, the desription beomes more ompliated and onduting estimations

is omplex and dependent on the geometry and struture of the breast. This problem

an be easily solved using a simulation of the photon transport through the phantom

3. Monte-Carlo simulation

There are two di(cid:27)erent possibilities for M-C simulation of the photon transport proess

in the phantom. The results of M-C simulations based on the onvolution method [2℄

(also known as (cid:16)fast(cid:17) M-C simulation), are sensitive to geometry and beam parameters.

This is why it is neessary to estimate the possible systemati unertainties of the

method eah time it is used when geometry, medium, beam size, et are hanged.

The method that we use in this work ((cid:16)full(cid:17) simulation) is based on the individual

transport of eah photon.

It is not as fast as onvolution, but is more aurate

when desribing the onrete experimental onditions. The hoie of the method

depends on the task.

In our opinion, the ode GEANT[12℄ is a very good hoie

for this purpose. This powerful Monte Carlo program was built for the transport of

elementary partiles through matter, and inludes all proesses of low energy photon

interations whih are relevant for the transport of typial mammography X-rays.

This program, whih has been tested to be appropriate for the high-energy region,

it is now more and more frequently used in medial physis[14℄. GEANT4 is (cid:29)exible

enough for the required additional programming in C++, and is user-friendly. To

reonstrut the thiknesses from the photon intensities at the image detetor plane

we will use mass attenuation oe(cid:30)ients from the NIST data base [10℄. The mass

attenuation oe(cid:30)ients for tissue omponents and alium arbonate are alulated

using perentages per weight aording to [13℄ and NIST and shown in Table 1.

Our estimates indiate that the agreement between these mass oe(cid:30)ients data and

GEANT internal ross setions for the physial proesses is not worse than 2 perent

in the energy region below 25 keV. At this stage, this agreement is su(cid:30)ient to study

the in(cid:29)uene of sattering on the auray of the thikness determination. To use

Miroali(cid:28)ation thikness determination

the ode it is neessary to desribe the photon beams inident on the phantom and

the geometry and omposition of the detetor. The simulated experimental setup is

shown in Fig. 2. Almost all signi(cid:28)ant harateristis of the digital mammography

unit Senographe 2000D (GE Medial Systems) have been inorporated in this setup

with the purpose to assume parameters of an existing system. No antisatter grid

is being used. For the photon beam, a typial X-ray spetrum for 25 kVp Mo/Mo

target/(cid:28)lter ombination has been used [15℄. The angular distribution of X-rays on

the phantom has been assumed uniform. Photons have been deteted by pixelized

on the ∼

phantom surfae is ∼
0.03 mGy [16℄. This dose is rather low ompared with the usual

, whih orresponds to a normalized

1.8x109

values in mammography. The results of the simulation have been stored in binary

(cid:28)les for the o(cid:31)ine analysis, performed by a program, that uses the mathematial and

graphi library ROOT[17℄.

4. Results and disussion

The simulated data were analyzed assuming 6 di(cid:27)erent shapes of the inident beam.

All these beams have retangular shapes on the phantom. The (cid:16)ideal(cid:17) beam is narrow

with dimensions 0.2x0.2 mm2

. For the other beams, one dimension is always equal

to the width of the detetor (20 mm) and the other is variable. We use the following

nomenlature:

0.2x0.2mm2
1x20mm2
3x20mm2
5x20mm2
10x20mm2
20x100mm2

, (cid:16) narrow(cid:17) beam;

, 1mm wide sanning beam ;

, 3mm wide sanning beam;

, 5mm wide sanning beam ;

, 10mm wide sanning beam ;

,(cid:16)NSR(cid:17) , non-sattering redution.

Data sanning was done along the detetor long axis and beam size was ontrolled

by the ollimator plaed between the X-ray soure and the phantom. For the

simulation of the sanning beam, the analysis inluded only the data generated by

photons inident within a ollimator region. The NSR regime didn't use any san.

In order to determine the harateristi size of the region of sattered photons,

in Fig 3 we have plotted the distribution of sattered photons, point spread funtion

(PSF), as a funtion of Dx (oordinate di(cid:27)erene between the initial and the sattered

photons position ). The spot size de(cid:28)ned as the PSF (root-mean-squared ) is ∼

For our geometry the SPR is 0.39, whih agrees with similar M-C [2℄ alulations for

1 m.

4 m thik phantoms and 25 kVp X-rays. The distribution in Fig. 3 shows that the

image of eah point depends on photons that pass up to 2 m away from the point .

This value depends on the geometry and will inrease as a funtion of total phantom

thikness. This result also indiates that, in order to determine the value of Nnc , it is
neessary to de(cid:28)ne a distane more than 2 m away from the µC . But, this distane

is su(cid:30)iently large for the struture and geometry of the phantom to have hanged.

That's why we suggest a di(cid:27)erent proedure of bakground alulation.

The total signal F (x, y) in the image (distribution of photons on the detetor) an
be expressed as the sum of the µC and the bakground signals, where the bakground

Miroali(cid:28)ation thikness determination

P (x, y) is supposed to show smooth behavior and the µC signal G(x, y) is desribed

using a Gaussian funtion:

F (x, y) = P (x, y) + ΣG(x, y),

(7)

where P (x, y) is a two-dimensional polynomial of order three and G(x, y) is a two-
dimensional Gaussian funtion for eah target µC . The parameters of this funtion
have been de(cid:28)ned by (cid:28)ts on simulation Nc(x, y) data. The number of parameters
in F (x, y) is 25 and the number of points ∼ 8000. The value of χ2

per point is

typially 1.5 - 2.5 whih is not bad (taking into aount the approximate desription

of the signal with Gaussian shapes). The desription of the target images as having

Gaussian shapes may not be the best, but it makes the task easier. After de(cid:28)ning its

parameters by (cid:28)t, the funtion P (x, y) has been used as the bakground instead of
Nnc(x, y) in the SN R, ontrast and thikness de(cid:28)nitions. A symmetri noise in the
thikness, SN R and ontrast de(cid:28)nitions with respet to zero, indiates that the (cid:28)t is

appropriate.

The F (x, y) for all the events (20x106 mm2

The dereasing values of F (x, y) near the edges of the detetor an be explained as

X-ray beam ) is plotted in Fig 4.

(0.2x0.2 mm2

X-ray beam ), as shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to make the bakground

1% ompared with a plane surfae). To redue the number of
behavior more (cid:29)at (±
parameters, the standard deviations σx and σy for eah Gaussian-shaped µC have
been set equal ( σx = σy ). The alulated diameters for all µC are plotted in Fig 6.

Error bars are parameter errors obtained during the (cid:28)t. The overestimations of the

transversal sizes (diameter) (∼ 25%) an be explained as the onsequene of a not-

totally appropriate desription of the signal by the Gaussian funtions. The thikness

dependene of the (alulated /original) µC diameter ratio in Fig. 6 an be explained
as the inrease of sattering as a funtion of the µC thikness.

The SN R is de(cid:28)ned as:

SN R(x, y) = (P (x, y)

Nc(x, y))/q(σP (x,y))2 + Nc(x, y),

(8)

−

where σP (x,y) is the de(cid:28)nition unertainty of the P (x, y), whih should be smaller

than p

P (x, y). In the alulations we have used the value p

P (x, y) for σP (x,y) .

The ontrast C is de(cid:28)ned as:

C(x, y) = (P (x, y)

Nc(x, y))/P (x, y).

−

The thikness tc is de(cid:28)ned as:

tc(x, y) = D

−1
µ log(P (x, y)/Nc(x, y))

and, from the (cid:28)ts, tf is de(cid:28)ned as:

tf (x, y) = Dµ log(P (x, y)/F (x, y))

(9)

(10)

(11)

where Nc(x, y) is the number of photons deteted in the pixel detetor, and Dµ
is the di(cid:27)erene between mean values of the linear attenuation oe(cid:30)ients for µC and

glandular tissue. The results for tf are shown in Fig 7 as the ratio of the reonstruted

( Gaussian maximum for eah target) value from Eqn.(11) to the original thiknesses,

for the (cid:16)narrow(cid:17) beam. For the other beams, we show their ratio with respet to

the (cid:16)narrow(cid:17). In order to get the orret thikness for the 200 µm ali(cid:28)ations it is

neessary to make a orretion due the peaked value of the Gaussian shape (suggested

orretion: a 0.73 fator on signal value (P (x, y)
F (x, y)) for the 200 µm and slowly
inreasing up to 0.80 for 1000 µm). As we have mentioned before, the Gaussian (cid:28)t is

−

not optimum for these ylindrial target shapes (diameter/thikness ratio is ∼4 - 20)

beause the (cid:29)at tops are notieable in the image.

Results of the 3-dimensional reonstruted distributions of tc(x, y), SN R(x, y)
and C(x, y) for our phantom are shown in Figs. 8 - 10. These distributions have been
used to determine the mean values of the thikness, SN R and ontrast of the targets.

To redue statistial errors we have alulated the mean values of the thikness only

for the ases where they are greater than the original thikness minus 3 noise values.

The entral target is 200 µm thik and the olleted statistis is enough to have a

signal 10 standard deviations above the noise for the 'narrow' beam (see Fig 8). For

the 200 µm thik µC , the signal to noise ratio is ∼ 10, (Fig 9) whih agrees with our
statement that thikness and SN R have similar sensitivities for µC detetion. The
bin size of the histograms is 0.5x0.5 mm2
detetor pixel size (0.1x0.1 mm2

. The same level of statistial errors for the

) an be reahed inreasing the dose approximately

25 times that is 0.75 mG, whih, is still low ompared with usual dose level.

The main soure of systemati unertainty in the thikness, SN R or ontrast

de(cid:28)nitions (shown in Figs 11-13) for ases with and without redution of sattering,

is the unertainty in the bakground de(cid:28)nition. The bakground de(cid:28)nition ould be

improved using a better signal desription. So, it is neessary to use funtions with

more parameters for a better signal desription as well as satter redution methods

to improve the de(cid:28)nitions of the above mentioned parameters.

4.1 SN R and Contrast

Contrast alulations have been done only to ompare with other alulations and

experimental data. The SN R and ontrast in the simulated images for di(cid:27)erent µC

thiknesses and for di(cid:27)erent beams are shown in Figs 12 and 13. No appreiable

di(cid:27)erene is observed between the SN R and ontrast dependenes on the µC
thiknesses. The SN R dependene is more linear than the ontrast and less sensitive to

the sattered photon ontribution. It is evident from Figs 12 and 13 that it is possible

17, 28%, respetively, using the
to improve SN R and ontrast by approximately ∼
(cid:16)narrow(cid:17) beam . This advantage is almost independent of the µC thikness up to the

1 mm region. Both parameters improve when the sanning beam size dereases. It

seems possible to reah a ∼17-27% improvement for the 3mm wide beam.

Results on ontrast improvement using grid or sanning beam that we (cid:28)nd in

the literature are diverse. Di(cid:27)erenes in experimental data are large, going from no

improvement at all [19℄ up to 50% [20, 4℄. The M-C alulation in [2℄ predits a 40%

ontrast improvement; the apparent disrepany with these results an be explained

from di(cid:27)erenes in geometry.

In our ase, one dimension of the sanning beam is

limited to 2 m and the ontribution of sattered photons doesn't reah its maximum

possible value. As an be seen in Fig. 4, the bakground value depends on the

distane of the beam to the phantom edge. Therefore, for the ontrast de(cid:28)ned by

Eqn. (9) the improvement depends on the oordinate and will inrease far away from

Miroali(cid:28)ation thikness determination

8

the boundaries.

In fat,

image quality improvement an be explained using the statistial

properties if the statistial noise is dominant. For a given inident exposure, for

the low SN R values lose to the detetion threshold and with approximation signal
≪ bakground, the SN R improvement parameter SI ( SI = SN Rwith/SN Rwithout
, where SN Rwith

and SN Rwithout

are the signal to noise ratios with and without

satter redution methods, respetively ) an be written as:

SI =

kp√1 + SP R
kp + ksSP R

= kp√BF ,

p
where kp = N with

p

/N without

, ks = N with

/N without

p

s

s

oe(cid:30)ients for primary and sattered photons, respetively. N with
and N without
s

p

, are the transmission

, N without
p

, N with
s

are the numbers of primary and sattered photons with and without

satter redution methods, respetively. BF is the Buky fator of the satter redution

grids[5, 21℄. So, in ase of using grids for satter redution and in order to have

improvement in SN R without any additional dose, it is neessary to provide the

following ondition for the transmission oe(cid:30)ients:

1 +

1 + 4ksSP R(1 + SP R)

kp

≥

p

2(1 + SP R)

.

For sanning beams the primary photons transmission oe(cid:30)ients kp are always 1
and the improvement depends on ks and SP R. The SI maximum value only depends
on the SP R value, and is equal to SImax = √1 + SP R. To obtain a given value of
SI

SImax , the transmission oe(cid:30)ient of the sattered photons satis(cid:28)es:

≤

(12)

(13)

(14)

ks =

1
SI 2 (1

−

SI 2
1
−
2SP R

)

For this transmission oe(cid:30)ient it is possible to alulate the beam sizes using

the point spread funtion (see Fig 3).

4.2 Thikness

Results of the alulated µC thikness for the di(cid:27)erent beams are shown in Figs.

11 and 14.

In Fig.

11 we show the thikness ratio for di(cid:27)erent dimensions of

the sanning beams. For the "narrow" beam, the systemati unertainty in the

bakground de(cid:28)nition is less than 1% (the (cid:29)atness of the bakground for the (cid:16)narrow(cid:17)

beam is ∼ 1%, see Fig 5). There is a ∼1-2% systemati disrepany between the
alulated and the original thiknesses for the 200 µm ali(cid:28)ation, whih inreases
2 % disagreement ould be related to
up to 3

4% for the 1 mm thik µC . The 1

−

−

di(cid:27)erenes in the mass attenuation oe(cid:30)ients used by GEANT during simulation and

NIST data used for the thikness reonstrution. This soure of systemati unertainty

is important only for the absolute thikness de(cid:28)nitions and will be smaller for the

thikness ratio de(cid:28)nitions. Another possible soure for this systemati unertainty is

the unertainty in the alium arbonate mass attenuation oe(cid:30)ient alulation.

The improvement of thikness determination when suppressing the sattering is

approximately 35% for small thiknesses and inreases up to 45 % for a 1 mm thik

Miroali(cid:28)ation thikness determination

9

ali(cid:28)ation as shown by Fig 11. This improvement an be greater when using wider

beams , sine the ontribution of sattered events an inrease by 30% (see Fig. 3)

and this would hange the bakground by ∼ 10%. The dependene of the thikness
improvement on the beam size in the sanned diretion for the di(cid:27)erent µC thikness
is shown in Fig 14. The improvement for all µC thiknesses will derease with beam

size and for the 3mm wide beam it will reah of 85-95 % of the "narrow" beam.

We have not been able to (cid:28)nd published experimental information about the use

of the thikness determination. There are data for visual ontrast improvement[4℄.

This onept is equivalent to thikness improvement, sine the attenuation oe(cid:30)ients

anel out in ratio. Data for VC [4℄ for phantom sizes 12.4x12.4x4 cm3

(50/50%

adipose /glandular) phantom with di(cid:27)erent exposed beams and grid types show

maximal VC improvement, up to 50% (unertainty ∼ 5%). Our results agree with

these data, taking into aount geometrial and phantom di(cid:27)erenes.

4.2.1 µC position unertainty Everything mentioned above is orret when the µC
target positions are known. Usually, the µC positions in the breast are unknown

and alulations of the absorption oe(cid:30)ient averages (see 4) are problemati, among

other reasons, beause photon spetrum will strongly depend on the depth of the

point in the phantom. In our ase, the µC absorption oe(cid:30)ient mean values have

been alulated assuming the photon spetrum at the enter of the phantom. The

systemati unertainty introdued by this simpli(cid:28)ation may be estimated for the 25

kVp Mo/Mo spetrum and 4 m thik phantom assumed in this study, as being ∼2.5%
in Dµ . This value ould be dereased, at least twie, using additional (cid:28)lters that

narrow the energy spetrum. These systemati unertainties will inrease with total

phantom thikness. To make miroali(cid:28)ation thikness measurements independent

of the breast thiknesses it would be neessary to use mono-energeti photon beams.

Conlusion

We have preformed Monte-Carlo simulation of 25 kVp Mo/Mo X-rays transported in a

4 m thik breast phantom. We have foused on the reonstrution of the thiknesses

of 0.2-1.0 mm thik miroali(cid:28)ations embedded in the phantom. We have shown

the possible thikness reonstrution with an auray of the order of 6% using a 3

mm wide slot sanning beam. This slot size, whih seems to be tehnialy feasible, for

a mamography unit promises results whih are lose to the ideal narrow beam. The

same beam ould improve the signal-to-noise ratio by ∼

using ideal narrow beam.

20 %, similar to the e(cid:27)et of

The µC thiknesses parameter an be used as alternative to SN R for

miroali(cid:28)ation detetion. The use of semi mono-energeti photon beams would

derease systemati unertainties in µC thiknesses determination. One of the goals

of this alulation was to show that the GEANT ode is appropriate for digital

mammography alulations.

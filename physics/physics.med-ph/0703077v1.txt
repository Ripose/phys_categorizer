Beams of Carbon nuclei are now in use or planned to be used in various centers for cancer treatment around
the world. The knowledge of the fragmentation of Carbon nuclei when they interact with the human body is
important for evaluating of the spatial proﬁle of their energy deposition in the tissues, hence the damage to tissues
neighbouring the tumor. To this purpose, the identiﬁcation of the fragmentation products is a key element. We
present in this paper the charge measurement of about 3000 fragments produced by the interaction of 12C nuclei
with an energy of 400 MeV/nucleon in a detector simulating the density of the human body. The nuclear emulsion
technique is used, by means of the so-called Emulsion Cloud Chamber. The nuclear emulsions are inspected using
fast automated microscopes recently developed. A charge assignment eﬃciency of more than 99% is achieved.
The separation of Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Berillium, Boron and Carbon can be achieved at two standard
deviations or considerably more, according to the track length available for the measurement.

1. Introduction

Unlike the radiation conventionally used for
cancer treatment, the particles called hadrons
(such as protons) deposit most of their energy
in a restricted domain around the end of their
ionisation range. This leads to a high therapeu-
tical eﬀectiveness with minimal damage to neigh-
bouring tissues. This is the merit of the so-called
Hadrontherapy. The thickness traversed before
depositing their energy can be tuned by chang-
ing the energy of the nuclei, typically of a few
hundreds MeV/nucleon.

In 1967 it was pointed out [1] that, among
is expected to im-

hadrons, the use of nuclei

prove the therapeutical eﬀectiveness. Light nuclei
and in particular Carbon nuclei are now used or
planned to be used for cancer therapy in a num-
ber of dedicated facilities around the world [2].

The nuclear fragments generated in the inter-
action of the projectile nuclei inside the patient
body go, however, beyond their ionisation range
thus producing some damage in the tissues dow-
stream of the tumor [3,4]. The study of the
fragmentation of the projectile nuclei is therefore
important to ascertain and optimize the preci-
sion in hitting the tumor with minimal eﬀects on
the neighbouring tissues. Moreover, the data ob-
tained in fragmentation studies contribute to de-

1

ﬁne the parameters of nuclear interaction mod-
els entering in computer programs which simulate
the biological eﬀects for the optimization of their
eﬀectiveness.

Studies of the nuclear fragmentation are cur-
rently carried out using a target which, from the
point of view of nuclear interactions, has proper-
ties close to those of the human body. The nu-
clear fragments are observed by detectors external
to the target. Their identiﬁcation was achieved by
comparing the energy loss in a plastic scintillator
and the total residual energy in a BGO scintilla-
tor [5,6]. The total charge-changing and partial
cross-section of 12C in carbon, paraﬃn and water
was reported in Ref. [7] by using etched track de-
tectors (Cr-39). Measurements of 10B and heav-
ier ions cross-section with several diﬀerent targets
were performed at GSI via the energy loss mea-
surement in a large-area ionisation chamber [8].
Nuclear emulsions allow the measurement with
very compact detectors of the fragments’ emis-
sion angles event by event with granularity and
space resolution at the micrometric level. The
development of techniques of controlled fading of
particle tracks [9] has opened the way to measure-
ments of the speciﬁc ionisation over a very broad
dynamic range. The possibility of identifying nu-
clear fragments through the measurement of their
speciﬁc ionisation, linked to the fragment’s elec-
trical charge, has been demonstrated [10,11,12] by
exposing an emulsion stack to beams of diﬀerent
nuclei. We choose nuclear emulsions as a detec-
tor for the study of the fragmentation of Carbon
nuclei since they combine the characteristics of a
very precise tracking device and the capability of
measuring the charge through the ionisation.

The Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC) tech-
nique [13] consists in using a sequence of nuclear
emulsion ﬁlms interleaved with plates of passive
material.
It thus allows to integrate the target
and the fragment detector. We have constructed
an ECC with polycarbonate as passive material,
approaching the nuclear properties of the human
body. The ECC was exposed to a beam of 12C
nuclei with an energy of 400 MeV/nucleon. The
ionisation of about 3000 nuclear fragments pro-
duced in their interactions in the ECC has been
measured. In this paper we report on the frag-

2

ment identiﬁcation eﬃciency and on the purity
obtained in this identiﬁcation. The study of the
fragmentation itself will be the subject of a forth-
coming paper.

2. Nuclear emulsions

Nuclear emulsions [14] provide tracking of par-
ticle trajectories with a very high spatial resolu-
tion in the three dimensions, with the capabil-
ity of measuring their ionisation. The passage of
ionising particles produces a latent image which
is turned into a sequence of silver grains (∼ 0.6
µm diameter) after a complex chemical process
known as development. The grains lie all along
the trajectory of the particle which can thus be
measured with a sub-micrometric accuracy.

The use of nuclear emulsions as a tridimen-
sional tracking device for particle physics, more
speciﬁcally for neutrino physics, was limited in
the past by the lengthty scanning procedure, orig-
inally by visual inspection at the microscope. It
has recently undergone a revival due to the im-
pressive and rapid development of very fast auto-
mated scanning systems [15,16,17], with a scan-
ning speed several orders of magnitudes higher
than the ﬁrst automated systems. A system de-
voted to very precise measurements was also de-
veloped [18]: the trajectory of tracks is measured
with an accuracy of 0.06 µm in position and 0.4
mrad in angle, compared to about 2 mrad of
systems oriented towards achieving the highest
speed [15,16,17].

In nuclear emulsions, minimum ionising parti-
cles (MIPs) are observed as thin tracks with a
grain density of about 30 grains/100 µm. The
grain density in emulsion is almost proportional
to the energy loss and its mean rate is given by
the Bethe-Bloch equation [14].

The proportionality of the grain density to the
energy loss by ionization holds over a limited
range, above which a saturation eﬀect dominates.
This eﬀect prevents the charge discrimination for
high ionizing particles. Nevertheless, by keeping
the emulsions for an appropriate time at a rela-
tively high temperature (above 30◦ Celsius) and
a high relative humidity (around 98%), a fading
is induced which partially or totally erases the

tracks of particles [9]. Thus, for instance, ﬁlms
may be made unsensitive to MIPs and suited for
highly ionising particles. This treatment is called
ref reshing. The combination of several ﬁlms
having undergone diﬀerent refreshing treatments
after exposure allows to disentangle particles with
diﬀerent charge and thus largely diﬀerent ioniza-
tion, overcoming saturation eﬀects. This is the
basis of the method reported in [10] and used for
the present work.

The emulsions used for this work belong to the
same batch of ﬁlms used in the OPERA exper-
iment for the study of neutrino oscillations [19].
The OPERA emulsion ﬁlms [9] have been devel-
oped for large-scale, high precision experiments
This development has allowed the ﬁrst indus-
trial production of nuclear emulsions (as for X-ray
ﬁlms), leading a considerably lower unit cost than
previously possible though maintaining a sensi-
tivity similar to that of handmade ﬁlms. The
OPERA nuclear emulsions have been produced
by the Fuji company3. They consist of 44 µm
thick emulsion layers deposited on both sides of
a 205 µm thick plastic support. The surface size
of the emulsion ﬁlms is 12.5x10.0 cm2.

3. The Emulsion Cloud Chamber and the

beam exposure

We have built an ECC made of a sequence of
nuclear emulsion ﬁlms interleaved, as passive ma-
terial, with 1 mm thick plates of polycarbonate
(Lexan) in a multiple sandwich structure. The
polycarbonate has a density of 1.15 g/cm3 and
an electron density of 3.6x1023 cm−3. For com-
parison, the electron density of water (the main
constituent of the human body) is 3.3x1023 cm−3
while the polymethil methacrylate target used in
Ref. [5,6] has a density of 1.19 g/cm3 and an elec-
tron density of 3.7x1023 cm−3. Thus the target
has similar characteristics to water for what con-
cerns nuclear interactions.

The ECC consisted of 73 consecutive modules,
each made of three emulsion ﬁlms interleaved
with polycarbonate plates. Its structure is shown
in Fig. 1. The 3 emulsion ﬁlms, denoted as R0, R1
and R2, were treated diﬀerently after the expo-

sure and before their chemical development. R0
was not resfreshed and was developed soon af-
ter the exposure. R1 and R2 underwent a 3 day
refreshing at 98% relative humidity with 30◦C
and 38◦C temperature, respectively. The pile of
emulsions and polycarbonate plates was vacuum
packed. A light-tight aluminum tape was used to
protect the pile from light.

The ECC was exposed to a beam of 12C
nuclei with an energy of 400 MeV/nucleon at
the Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator (HIMAC) in
Chiba (Japan). The beam ﬂux was monitored by
a scintillator counter. On the emulsion ﬁlms, an
integrated ﬂux of about 10 12C nuclei per mm2
was obtained. This is a compromise between the
need of a large statistics and the need of avoiding
the overlapping between close vertices. The in-
cident beam angle with respect to the emulsions
and the polycarbonate plates had a spread of a
few mrad. The ECC was placed in three position:
with emulsion ﬁlms perpendicular to the beam
and inclined of about ±150 mrad. The tilted ex-
posures were meant to improve the ﬁlm to ﬁlm
alignment.

The chemical development was carried out at
the Nagoya University. After the development,
the ﬁlms were brought to Naples University where
they were analyzed by fast automated micro-
scopes operating at a speed of 20 cm2/hour with
tracking eﬃciency larger than 90% and high pu-
rity (∼ 2 fake tracks/cm2) [16,17].

4. Analysis methods

The automated microscopes have a focal depth
of a few µm. Therefore, by varying the focal plane
over 20 levels along the depth of the emulsion
layers, they gather a series of tomographic images
which are read by a CMOS camera. A track is
seen as a sequence of grains at diﬀerent depths,
each grain consisting of a cluster of pixels. Apart
from saturation eﬀects, the grain density along
the particle path is proportional to the speciﬁc
ionization. Therefore as a variable sensitive to the
speciﬁc ionization, hence to the particle charge,
we take the sum of the pixels of all the grains
belonging to the track normalized to a given track
length in the emulsions. This sum is called track
volume.

In the data acquisition, the automated micro-
scope reconstructs the so-called micro-tracks, a
micro-track being a sequences of aligned grains in
a 44 µm emulsion layer. The alignment, within
errors, of two micro-tracks in a ﬁlm gives a so-
called base-track. Base-tracks are characterised
by a higher angular precision than micro-tracks,
because of the lever arm given by the thickness
of the plastic base and, for the grains close to the
base, the absence of distortions resulting from the
chemical development.

In the ECC, the emulsion ﬁlms are piled up
with a mechanical accuracy of a few hundred mi-
crometers. By using straight penetrating tracks
as references,
in the oﬄine analysis the ﬁlms
are aligned with an accuracy of a few microm-
eters [20]. After this ﬁne alignment, base-tracks
are associated to form tracks of particles.

In principle, each track is characterized by
three track volume variables (V R0, V R1 and
V R2), one for each refreshing condition (R0, R1
and R2) of the ﬁlms traversed by the track. By
averaging over the base-tracks in the emulsions
having undergone the same refreshing, the statis-
tical error on the track volume is reduced thus
providing a better charge discrimination.

The R2 refreshing procedure produces the com-
plete erasing of all tracks of particle with charge
equal to 1. Therefore, for proton identiﬁcation
only V R0 and V R1 are used. For Helium and
heavier nuclei only V R1 and V R2 are eﬀective,

4

since V R0 shows saturation. The charge sepa-
ration is obtained by looking at correlations be-
tween appropriate pairs of track volume variables.

5. Results

In this analysis, all carbon interactions along
the ECC are considered. This implies that the
parent carbon energy ranges from almost 0 to 400
MeV/nucleon. Therefore also the fragmentation
products have a very wide energy spectrum. In
Fig. 2 we show the scatter plot of V R0 versus
V R1 for the fragmentation products. We see two
distinct peaks corresponding to H and He. Heav-
ier ions are not clearly identiﬁed. By projecting
the scatter plot onto an axis passing through the
centers of the two peaks, we obtain the distri-
bution of the variable V R01 shown in Fig. 3. A
good separation between H and He is visible. The
events in-between the two Gaussian distributions
are due to the wide momentum distribution of the
H produced by the carbon nuclei interactions.

Fig. 4 shows the scatter plot of V R1 versus
V R2 for the fragmentation products. The sepa-
ration of Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron and
Carbon becomes clear. By projecting the scatter
plot onto an axis passing through the centers of
the peaks, we obtain the distribution of the vari-
able V R12 shown in Fig. 5. Also in this case, the
fraction of events in-between He and Li is due
to the low momentum tail of the He particles.
The eﬀect of the momentum spectrum becomes
negligible for heavier nuclei since they tend to be
produced with similar speed to the projectile.

1 + σ2

Table 1 gives the separation of pairs of nuclei in
standard deviations, for a set of diﬀerent values of
the number of base-tracks. The standard devia-
tion σ for the separation of two nuclei is deﬁned as
σ = pσ2
2 where σ1 and σ2 are the standard
deviations of the charge measurement for the two
nuclei. In terms of total traversed ECC length,
one base-track corresponds to 1.3 mm. One sees
that to separate H-He, He-Li, Li-Be and Be-B at
approximately 3 σ one needs 3, 5, 12 and 30 base-
tracks, respectively. With 30 base-tracks, Boron
and Carbon have a 2.4 σ separation. With suf-
ﬁcient track lengths, even better separations are
achieved.

We have collected and analyzed about 3000
tracks. The charge assignment failed only for 27
of them. The corresponding charge assignment
eﬃciency is (99.1±0.2)%. The ineﬃciency is con-
nected to very short tracks. Indeed, the 27 tracks
are tracks with only 2 base-tracks, in R0 and R2,
thus preventing the estimate of both the variables
V R01 and V R12.

these fragments with 99% eﬃciency. The charge
separation improves statistically with the track
length. The separation of the Hydrogen, Helium,
Lithium, Berillium, Boron and Carbon can be
achieved at two standard deviations or consider-
ably more, depending on the track length which
is used for the measurement.

Acknowledgments

We have exposed an Emulsion Cloud Cham-
ber to a beam of 12C nuclei with an energy of
400 MeV/nucleon. The chamber was made of
nuclear emulsion ﬁlms and polycarbonate plates.
We have analyzed about 3000 particle tracks pro-
duced by the Carbon fragmentation inside the
chamber. By analyzing the grain density along
the particle track by means of fast automated mi-
croscopes, we were able to assign the charge to

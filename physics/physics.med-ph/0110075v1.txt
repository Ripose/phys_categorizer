It is shown that the distribution of low variability periods in the activity of human heart rate
typically follows a multi-scaling Zipf’s law. The presence or failure of a power law, as well as the
values of the scaling exponents, are personal characteristics depending on the daily habits of the
subjects. Meanwhile, the distribution function of the low-variability periods as a whole discriminates
eﬃciently between various heart pathologies. This new technique is also applicable to other non-
linear time-series and reﬂects these aspects of the underlying intermittent dynamics, which are not
covered by other methods of linear- and nonlinear analysis.

The nonlinear and scale-invariant aspects of the heart
rate variability (HRV) have been studied intensively dur-
ing the last decades. This continuous interest to the HRV
can be attributed to the controversial state of aﬀairs: on
the one hand, the nonlinear and scale-invariant analysis
of HRV has resulted in many methods of very high prog-
nostic performance (at least on test groups) [1, 2, 3, 4];
on the other hand, practical medicine is still conﬁdent to
the traditional “linear” methods. The situation is quite
diﬀerent from what has been observed three decades ago,
when the “linear” measures of HRV became widely used
as important noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic tools,
soon after the pioneering paper [5]. Apparently, there is
a need for further evidences for the superiority of new
methods and for the resolution of the existing ambigui-
ties.

During recent years the main attention of studies has
been focused on the analysis of the scale-invariant meth-
ods.
It has been argued that measures related to a
certain time-scale (e.g. 5 min) are less reliable, because
the characteristic time-scales of physiological processes
are patient-speciﬁc. The scale-invariant measures are of-
ten believed to be more universal and sensitive to life-
threatening pathologies [1, 2]. However, carefully de-
signed time-scale-related measures can be also highly
successful, because certain physiological processes are re-
lated to a speciﬁc time scale [3].

The scale invariance has been exclusively seen in the
heart rhythm following the (multi)fractional Brownian
motion (fBm) [6]. It has been understood that the heart
rhythm ﬂuctuates in a very complex manner and reﬂects
the activities of the subject (sleeping, watching TV, walk-
ing etc.) [7, 9] and cannot be adequately described by
In order to
a single Hurst exponent of a simple fBm.
reﬂect the complex behavior of the heart rhythm, the
multi-aﬃne generalization of the fBm has been invoked
[1, 2]; it has been claimed that the multifractal scaling

exponents are of a signiﬁcant prognostic value.

The approach based on fBm addresses long-time dy-
namics of the heart rhythm while completely neglecting
the short-scale dynamics on time scales less than one
minute (the respective frequencies are typically ﬁltered
out [6]). The short-time variability has been described
only by the so called linear measures, such as pN N 50 (the
probability that two adjacent normal heart beat intervals
diﬀer more than 50 milliseconds). Meanwhile, the level of
the short-time variability of the human heart rate varies
in a very complex manner, the high- and low-variability
periods are deeply intertwined [7]. This is a very impor-
tant aspect, because the low-variability periods are the
periods when the heart is in a stressed state, with high
level of signals arriving from the autonomous nervous
system. The conventional linear measures are not ap-
propriate for describing such a complex behavior. Thus,
there is a clear need for suitable nonlinear methods.

In this paper we present a new scale-invariant descrip-
tion of the short-time variability of the heart rate. It is
shown that the distribution of low-variability periods in
the activity of a normal heart follows the Zipf’s law. It
is also shown that the distribution function of the low-
variability periods contains a considerable amount of di-
agnostically valuable information. This new technique
is also applicable to other non-linear time-series, such as
EEG signals and ﬁnancial data [8].

Our analysis is based on ambulatory Holter-monitoring
data (recorded at Tallinn Diagnostic Centre) of 218 pa-
tients with various diagnoses. The groups of patients
are shown in Table 1. The sampling rate of ECG was
180 Hz. The patients were monitored during 24 hour un-
der normal daily activities. The preliminary analysis of
the ECG recordings was performed using the commercial
software; this resulted in the sequence of the normal-to-
normal (NN) intervals tN N (measured in milliseconds),
which are deﬁned as the intervals between two subsequent

normal heartbeats (i.e. normal QRS complexes).

Originally, the Zipf’s law addressed the distribution of
words in a language [12]: every word has assigned a rank,
according to its “size” f , deﬁned as the relative number
of occurrences in some long text (the most frequent word
obtains rank r = 1, the second frequent — r = 2, etc).
r−α is
The empirical size-rank distribution law f (r)
surprisingly universal: in addition to all the tested natu-
ral languages, it applies also to many other phenomena.
The scaling exponent α is often close to one (e.g. for the
distribution of words). Typically, the Zipf’s law is ap-
plicable to a dynamical system at statistical equilibrium,
when the following conditions are satisﬁed: (a) the sys-
tem consists of elements of diﬀerent size; (b) the element
size has upper and lower bounds; (c) there is no inter-
mediate intrinsic size for the elements. As already men-
tioned, the human heart rhythm has a complex structure,
where the duration τ of the low-variability periods varies
in a wide range of scales, from few to several hundreds of
heart beats. Thus, one can expect that the distribution
of the low-variability periods follows the Zipf’s law

−γ.

However, the scaling behavior should not be expected to
be perfect. Indeed, the heart rate is a non-stationary sig-
nal aﬀected by the non-reproducible daily activities of the
subjects. The non-stationary pattern of these activities,
together with their time-scales, is directly reﬂected in
the above mentioned distribution law. This distribution
law can also have a ﬁngerprint of the characteristic time-
scale (around ten to twenty seconds) of the blood pres-
sure oscillations. Finally, there is a generic reason why
the Zipf’s law fails (or is non-perfect) at small rank num-
bers. The Zipf’s law is a statistical law; meanwhile, each
rank-length curve is based on a single measurement. Par-
ticularly, there is only one longest low-variability period
(and likewise, only one most-frequent word), the length
of which is just as long as it happens to be, there is no av-
eraging whatsoever. For large rank values r, the relative
statistical uncertainty can be estimated as 1/√r.

To begin with, we deﬁne the local variability for each
(i-th) interbeat interval as the deviation of the heart rate
from the local average,

The angular braces denote the local average, calculated
using a narrow (5 beats wide) Gaussian weight function.
Further, we introduce a threshold value δ0; i-th interbeat
interval is said to have a low variability, if the condition

is satisﬁed. A low-variability period is deﬁned as a set of
consecutive low-variability intervals; its length τ is mea-
sured in the number of heartbeats. Finally, all the low-
variability periods are arranged according to their lengths
and associated with ranks. The rank of a period is plot-
ted versus its length in a logarithmic graph, see Fig. 1;
Zipf’s law would correspond to a straight descending line.

ods: the rank r of a period is plotted versus its duration τ
(measured in heartbeats) for diﬀerent values of the threshold
parameter δ0.

(1)

For a very low threshold parameter δ0, all the low-
variability periods are very short, because it is diﬃcult
to satisfy the stringent condition (3). In that case, the
inertial range of scales is too short for a meaningful scal-
ing law. On the other hand, for a very high value of
δ0, there is a single low-variability period occupying the
entire HRV-recording. Between these two cases, there is
such a range of the values of δ0, which leads to a non-
trivial rank-length law. For a typical healthy patient, the
r(τ )-curve is reasonably close to a straight line, and the
scaling exponent γ is a function of the threshold parame-
ter δ0. Thus, unlike all the other well-known applications
of the Zipf’s law, we are dealing with a multi-scaling law.
Recently, Ivanov et. al. [2] have reported that anoma-
lous multifractal spectra of the HRV signal indicate an
increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, it is
natural to ask, does the presence or failure of the multi-
scaling behavior indicate the healthiness of the patient?
In what follows we discuss a somewhat more general ques-
tion: what is the relationship between the properties of
the distribution function of the low variability periods
and the diagnosis of the patient. Testing the prognostic

ﬁt-line. However, the above mentioned eﬀect of the non-
stationary pattern of the subjects daily activities makes
the situation more complicated. There is no easy way
to quantify this eﬀect and therefore, we opted for the
simplest possible solution, simple straight limit lines.

The scaling exponent γ has been calculated for all the
patients and Student test was applied to every pair of
groups.
In most cases, the signiﬁcance was quite low;
two best distinguishable groups were RR and FSK, the
result of Student test being 5.7%. Therefore, one can
argue that the slopes of linear parts are highly personal
characteristics depending also on the daily habits of the
subjects, which are weakly correlated with diagnosis.

Further we tested, how is the failure of the power law
correlated with the diagnosis. The width of the scaling
range ∆ was used as a measure of how well the curve
is corresponding to a power law. The Student test re-
sults for the parameter ∆ turned out to be similar to
what has been observed for the parameter γ: the corre-
lation between the failure of the power law and diagnosis
was weak. Thus, a rank-length curve resembling the one
depicted by a dashed line in Fig. 2, does not hint to
heart pathology. It should be also noted that the dashed
curve in Fig. 2 can be considered as a generalized form
of scale-invariance with scale-dependent diﬀerential scal-
ing exponent. Such a behavior seems to be universal; for
instance, certain forest ﬁre models [10] lead to the diﬀer-
ential fractal dimension depending on the local scale.

Finally, we analyzed the diagnostic signiﬁcance of the
parameters ln τend and ln τstart. This analysis does make
sense, because typically, the start- and end-points of the
scaling range correspond to certain physiological time-
scales. The parameter ln τend provided, indeed, a remark-
able resolution between the groups of patients, see Table
2. According to the Student test, the healthy patients,
were distinct from ﬁve heart pathology groups with prob-

signiﬁcance for predicting sudden cardiac death, which is
also of a great importance, has been postponed due to
the nature of our test groups.

First, let us analyze the correlation between the diag-
nosis of a patient and the scaling exponent γ. To begin
with, we have to determine the optimal value for the
threshold parameter δ0. For a meaningful analysis, the
scaling behavior should be as good as possible. It turned
out that for a typical patient, the best approximation
of the function r(τ ) with a power law is achieved for
δ0
0.05 (see Fig. 2a); in what follows, all the values of
the exponent γ are calculated for δ0 = 0.05. It should be
noted that for some patients, the length-rank distribution
is still far from a power law (see Fig. 2b).

≈

The slope of a curve on the logarithmic plot is calcu-
lated using root-mean-square (rms) ﬁt for such a range
of lengths [τstart, τend], for which the r(τ )-curve is nearly
a power law, and the scaling range width ∆ = ln τend
−
ln τstart is as large as possible. Bearing in mind the statis-
tical nature of the Zipf’s law and non-stationarity of the
underlying signal, we have chosen a not very stringent
deﬁnition of what is “nearly a power law”, see Fig. 3.
Around the rms-ﬁt-line, two limit lines are drawn; τstart
and τend correspond to the points, where the r(τ )-curve
crosses the limit lines.

Note that the precise placement and shape of the limit
lines is arbitrary, i.e. small variations do not lead to qual-
itative eﬀects. Here, the distance of the limit lines from
the central line has been chosen to be ln 2 at τ = τmax,
and zero at τ = 1, where τmax is the length of the
longest low-variability period. Admitting mismatch ln 2
at τ = τmax is motivated by the observation that due to
the lack of any statistics, the longest low-variability pe-
riod could have been easily twice as long as we measured
it to be. For large rank values, the statistical uncer-
tainty is assessed as √r; in logarithmic graph, this would
correspond to an exponentially decreasing (with increas-
ing r) distance between a limit curve and the central

ability p < 1.6%. The parameter ln τstart was diagnosti-
cally less signiﬁcant.

Unfortunately, the calculation of the parameter τend is
technically quite a complicated task, not suited for clini-
cal practice. Therefore, we aimed to ﬁnd a simpler alter-
native to it. Basically, the strategy was to ﬁnd a simple
parameter reﬂecting the behavior of the rightmost (large-

4

τ ) part of the r(τ )-curve. An easy option is ln τmax, which
has been already analyzed [11]. This parameter has in-
deed a considerable diagnostic value, but its reliability
is decreased by the above discussed statistical ﬂuctua-
tions. Better alternatives are provided by (a) the overall
number of low-variability periods rmax (which is small, if
there are lot of long low-variability periods); (b) the coor-
dinates of speciﬁc points of the rank-length curve. Here
we chose a set of critical ranks R = 10, 20 or 40, and
determined the respective lengths τR so that r(τR) = R.
We also ﬁxed a set of critical length values, T = 50,
100, or 200, and determined the respective rank numbers
rT = r(T ), see Fig. 4. Both techniques turned out to be
of high diagnostic performance; illustrative p-values are
given in Table 2. Parameters τ10 and τ20 performed less
well than τ40 (for instance, the p-values for the healthy
and VES-subject groups were 0.60%, 0.58% and 0.34%,
respectively), and are not presented in tabular data. Sim-
ilarly, r100 turned out to be more eﬃcient than r50 and
r200 (the respective healthy and VES-group p-values be-
ing 0.02%, 0.01%, and 0.09%). It also outperforms τ40,
but is sometimes less eﬃcient than rmax or τend (see Table
2). Hence, various heart pathologies seem to aﬀect the
heart rate dynamics at the time scale around 100 heart
beats (one to two minutes).

In conclusion, new aspect of non-linear time-series has
been discovered, the scale-invariance of low-variability
periods. We have shown that the distribution of low vari-
ability periods in the activity of human heart rate typi-
cally follows a multi-scaling Zipf ’s law. The presence or
failure of a power law, as well as the values of the scaling
exponents, are personal characteristics depending on the
daily habits of the subjects. Meanwhile, the distribution
function of the low-variability periods as a whole con-
tains also a signiﬁcant amount of diagnostically valuable
information, the most part of which is reﬂected by the
parameters r100, rmax, and τend, see Table 2. These quan-
tities characterize the complex structure of HRV signal,
where the low- and high variability periods are deeply
intertwined, aspect which is not covered by the other
methods of heart rate variability analysis (such as frac-
tional Brownian motion based multifractal analysis). As
a future development, it would be of great importance
to analyze the prognostic value of the above mentioned
parameters for patients with sudden cardiac death.

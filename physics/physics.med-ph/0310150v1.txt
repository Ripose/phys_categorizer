The dosimetry for radiocolloid therapy of cystic craniopharyngiomas is investigated. Analytical
calculations based on the Loevinger and the Berger formulae for electrons and photons, respectively,
are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The role of the material of which the colloid introduced

inside the craniopharyngioma is made of as well as that forming the cyst wall is analyzed.
is found that the analytical approaches provide a very good description of the simulated data in
the conditions where they can be applied (i.e., in the case of a uniform and inﬁnite homogeneous
medium). However, the consideration of the diﬀerent materials and interfaces produces a strong
reduction of the dose delivered to the cyst wall in relation to that predicted by the Loevinger and
the Berger formulae.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Craniopharyngiomas are tumors showing an incidence of 3% for all tumors in adults and 6 to 10% of tumors in
children [1]. Though histologically benign, they are eﬀectively malignant because they usually appear in a situation
which can aﬀect to important organs such as hypothalamus, optic nerves or chiasms.

Treatment based on surgery followed (or not) by radiation therapy needs a total resection to guarantee a good
chance of cure. However, a complete excision is rarely possible due to the vicinity of the organs mentioned above [2].
Alternatively, the introduction of radioactive colloids into the cyst has been considered since the early 50’s [3, 4].
Cyst wall constitutes the target volume and, as a consequence, β-emitters, as e.g. 32P and 90Y are the most adequate.
Also βγ-emitters, as 186Re and 198Au, have been used, since γ-radiation allows to test the colloid distribution by
obtaining a gamma camera image.

Cystic craniopharyngiomas are roughly spherical and the wall of the cyst presents a thickness between 1 and 3 mm.
Once the radiocolloid is introduced inside the craniopharyngioma, part of it is attached to the inner surface of the
cyst, while the rest appears to be distributed into the inner volume.

[6]) or by using the β point kernels generated by Berger [7] (see e.g.

Dosimetry calculations for β emitters have been carried out either on the base of the Loevinger formulation [5] (see
[8]). In the case of βγ-emitters, the dose
e.g.
rates for photons have been evaluated following the approach of Berger [9] in terms of the build-up factors for the
appropriate energies (see e.g. [8]).

In order to perform the dosimetry, because of the characteristic distribution of the radiocolloid, two extreme
situations have been considered in practice [6, 8]. The ﬁrst one is the spherical shell source, where the emitter is
supposed to be uniformly distributed in the inner surface of the cyst. The second one is the spherical volume source
(SVS), which assumes the radionuclide uniformly distributed in the inner volume of the craniopharyngioma. In all
cases, a uniform and inﬁnite homogeneous medium is considered and the presence of diﬀerent material media and
interfaces is not taken into account.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulation oﬀers the possibility to perform a more realistic dosimetry. In this paper we have
studied how the consideration of the actual media involved in the craniopharyngiomas modiﬁes the results of the
standard calculations.

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS

Here we have assumed that the cystic craniopharyngioma is described by means of a spherical layer of thickness
δ and inner radius R (see Fig. 1). We adopted SVS approach and then we dealt with extended uniform spherical
sources of given radionuclides. We were interested in calculating the dose delivered to the cyst wall as well as to
points external to the craniopharyngioma and related to the critical surrounding tissue. The corresponding dose rate

is accounted for by evaluating the integral

where V represents the source volume, x and r are, respectively, the positions of the target point and of the volume
element of the distribution with respect to its center, C(r) ≡ A gives the radionuclide activity concentration and
J(|x − r|) represents the absorbed dose rate in x due to a point source in r.

In the case of β sources, dosimetry calculations can be performed on the basis of the Loevinger formula [5], which
gives the absorbed dose distribution around a point source of a β-emitting radionuclide in a homogeneous inﬁnite
medium. In this approach the absorbed dose rate at a distance x from the point source is given by

In previous equations, z = (ρν)−1 and t = cz are characteristic distances, ρ the density of the homogeneous medium,
ν an apparent absorption coeﬃcient and c a dimensionless parameter. The normalization constant B is evaluated by
imposing that all the emitted energy is absorbed in a very large sphere, and is given by

and Eβ the average energy per disintegration. Finally,

The parameters ν and c are characteristic of each β-emitter. For the ﬁrst one, Loevinger et al. [5] gave the following

B. Photon sources

When βγ-emitters are used, the photon dosimetry is usually based on the formula of Berger [9]. In this approach,

a photon point isotropic source is assumed to deposit a dose rate at a distance x from the source which is given by

Jγ(x) =

1
4π

µen
ρ

Eγ

1
x2 exp(−µx) Ben(µx) .

Here µen and µ are the linear photon energy-absorption and the linear photon attenuation coeﬃcients, respectively,
at the energy of the emitted photon, Eγ, and Ben is the energy-absorption buildup factor, which takes into account
the contribution of the scattered photons. Following Ref. [9], the buildup factors are expanded as

Ben(µx) =

bn (µx)n .

Here b0 = 1 and the remaining coeﬃcients were calculated in [9] for some energies ranging from 10 keV to 3 MeV.

As in the case of the Loevinger formula, the integral in Eq. (1) can be calculated analytically for the dose rate in
Eq. (6), in the case of the uniform spherical radionuclide distribution we are assuming here (see Appendix). From
Eq. (A11) we have

C. Simulation procedure

MC simulations were performed by using the code PENELOPE [11]. PENELOPE is a general purpose MC code
which allows to simulate the coupled electron-photon transport. Analog simulation is performed for photons. For
electrons, the simulation is carried out in a mixed scheme where collisions are characterized as hard and soft. After
ﬁxing a value for a critical angle, the collisions with scattering angles larger than the critical value are called hard
collisions and are simulated individually. The collisions with scattering angle smaller than the critical value are called
soft collisions and are described by means of a multiple scattering theory. The electron tracking is controlled by four
parameters. Two of them, called C1 and C2, refer to elastic collisions. The ﬁrst one, C1, gives the average angular
deﬂection due to an elastic hard collision and to the soft collisions previous to it. The second parameter, C2, represents
the maximum value permitted for the average fractional energy loss in a step. The other two parameters, called Wcc

4

and Wcr are energy cutoﬀs to distinguish hard and soft events. Thus, the inelastic electron collisions with energy loss
W < Wcc and the emission of Bremsstrahlung photons with energy W < Wcr are considered in the simulation as soft
interactions.

For arbitrary materials, PENELOPE can be applied for energies up to 1 GeV and down to few hundred eV, in the
case of electrons, and 1 keV, for photons. Besides, PENELOPE permits a good description of the particle transport
at the interfaces and presents a more accurate description of the electron transport at low energies in comparison to
other general purpose MC codes. These characteristics make PENELOPE to be an useful tool for medical physics
applications as previous works have pointed out (see e.g. Refs.
[12]-[14]). Details about the physical processes
considered can be found in Ref. [11].

In our simulations, the cyst was supposed to be surrounded by an inﬁnitely extended water volume. Both, the
spherical layer simulating the craniopharyngioma as well as the colloid introduced into the cyst were assumed to be
made of diﬀerent materials. Thus, we labelled the dose rates obtained with the simulations as ˙Dvs
ω , where the subscript
ω refers to β or γ according to the primary particle emitted and the superscripts v and s indicate, respectively, the
materials of which the inner volume and the spherical shell are made of. Here we considered four materials: soft tissue
(t), compact bone (b), gel (g) and water (w). The respective compositions are given in Table I.

The point sources representing the radionuclide were assumed to be uniformly distributed inside the craniopharyn-
gioma. The direction of the emitted particles was supposed to be isotropic around the initial position. For electrons,
the initial energy was sampled from the corresponding Fermi distributions, taken from Ref.
[16]. For photons, the
initial energy was sampled according to the relative intensity of the diﬀerent energies of the corresponding spectra.

Electrons and photons were simulated for energies above 100 eV and 1 keV, respectively. Below these energies, the
particles were considered to be locally absorbed. The simulation parameters were ﬁxed to the values: Wcc = 5 keV,
Wcr = 1 keV, C1 = C2 = 0.05.

Due to the spherical symmetry of the adopted SVS geometry, the dose distributions were supposed to be functions
of the distance to the center of the distribution, x. The full simulation volume was subdivided into spherical shells with
radial thickness of 0.5 mm. The energy deposited in each voxel was scored to obtain the corresponding histograms.

The statistical uncertainties were calculated by scoring both the energy deposited in a voxel and its square for each

history. The average energy deposited in the k-th bin (per incident particle) is

same results in semilogarithmic scale. Besides the MC results obtained switching it oﬀ Bremsstrahlung are plotted with black
squares.

III. RESULTS

A. Pure β radionuclides

We started by considering a pure β emitter as radionuclide in the colloid: the 32P nucleus. The β-spectrum of this
β = 1.71 MeV with a mean energy Eβ = 0.695 MeV. The decay transition to 32S
isotope has a maximum energy Emax
is of allowed type and the parameters entering in the Loevinger formula are c = 1 and ν = 9.18 cm2 g−1. Initially we
analyzed cysts with R = 1.75 cm and δ = 1 mm, while the activity concentration of the radiocolloid was supposed to
be 1 MBq cm−3.

First, we have assumed that both the inner volume and the layer were made of water. In this situation (uniform and
inﬁnite homogeneous medium), the results of the simulation can be compared directly with our analytical calculations
based on the Loevinger approach (Eq. (5)) or other analytical approaches such as that of Vynckier and Wambersie
[17]. In this last method the β point kernels generated were more accurate than those in the Loevinger approach.
The results are shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2, where the full and dashed curves show the results obtained with
the Loevinger and Vynckier and Wambersie approaches, respectively, and the open squares are the results of our
MC simulation. In the lower panel, the same results are plotted in semilogarithmic scale in order to emphasize the
diﬀerences at large distances. In Table II we show the values of the relative diﬀerences calculated as:

where the subscripts A and B stand for the Loevinger (L) and Vynckier and Wambersie (VW) approaches or the
MC simulation. As we can see, Loevinger and MC results agree rather well up to x ∼ 2 cm. Above this point, the
disagreement is apparent, but the value of the dose rate is, at least, one order of magnitude smaller than the dose
rate in the cyst wall. Vynckier and Wambersie model provides a slightly better result up to x ∼ 2.3 cm. At larger
distances, the Vynckier and Wambersie approach goes to zero, but there the dose rate is, at least, three orders of

magnitude below that in the wall. Similar results are obtained if the β point kernels used are those provided by Berger
[7].

TABLE II: Relative diﬀerences (see Eq. (9)) in % between the results obtained for 32P, in the case of unique medium, with the
Loevinger (L) and Vynckier and Wambersie (VW) approaches and MC simulation.

To ﬁnish the discussion for a unique medium, we analyzed the role of the Bremsstrahlung radiation. PENELOPE
includes this mechanism and, in order to estimate its importance we have performed a new simulation by switching
it oﬀ. The results obtained are plotted with black squares in the lower panel of Fig. 2. As we can see, the eﬀect
of the Bremsstrahlung shows up above ∼ 2.4 cm. However, at that distance, the dose deposited is four orders of
magnitude smaller than the dose delivered to the cyst wall. On the other hand, we can see that the Vynckier and
Wambersie model does not include Bremsstrahlung at all, while the Loevinger approach takes it into account in a
somehow average way. Despite this, the conclusion is that these analytical approaches permit a reasonable description
of the dose rate delivered by this kind of extended sources within a unique medium.

The next step was to investigate the role played by the interfaces present in the craniopharyngioma. The idea
was to elucidate, by using MC simulation, if the various interfaces and materials modify the dosimetry provided by
the Loevinger approach. To measure the eﬀect of the presence of the diﬀerent materials, we calculated the relative
diﬀerences

are the integral dose rates delivered inside the cyst wall. Here k runs over all the bins contained inside the cyst wall,
ρs is the density of the material forming this wall and vs is its volume.

We have ﬁrst studied the eﬀect of the material forming the spherical shell which represents the craniopharyngioma.
We have considered two extreme cases: soft tissue and compact bone. The diﬀerences of the dose rates calculated
with MC in both situations with respect to ˙Dww
β (x) are shown in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 3. The relative diﬀerences
in the cyst wall are given in Table III. As we can see, the presence of the soft tissue in the spherical shell leaves
practically unmodiﬁed the dosimetry. In fact, the total dose rate delivered to this shell increases by only 0.9% in this
case. On the contrary, when the bone is considered the dose received by the wall reduces 28.0%. Furthermore, the
dose rate delivered to the external medium nearby the craniopharyngioma diminishes appreciably in the case of the
bone, while no modiﬁcations are observed for soft tissue. Obviously, these modiﬁcations are not considered in the
analytical expressions based on the Loevinger approach.

FIG. 3: Eﬀect of the materials considered for the spherical shell which represents the cystic wall in our model and for the inner
volume. Panels (a) and (b) show the eﬀect of considering the wall of the craniopharyngioma to be done of soft tissue and bone,
respectively. Panels (c) and (d) show the eﬀect due to the substitution of the water by the gel in the inner volume. Finally,
panels (e) and (f ) show the full eﬀect due to the presence of these materials with respect to the reference dose rate ˙Dww
β (x).
The shadow region shows the cystic wall which has been considered to have a thickness δ = 1 mm. Error bars correspond to
1σ and are smaller than the size of the symbol used.

In the treatment procedure, the radionuclide is introduced in the craniopharyngioma inner volume, embedded in a
certain type of colloid. In our simulations we have considered the gel with the composition given in Table I. In panels
(c) and (d) of Fig. 3 we show the diﬀerences in the dose rates obtained when the water is substituted by the gel in
the inner volume. As we can see, the gel produces a noticeable reduction of the dose delivered to the cyst wall. This
reduction reaches 20.7% in the case of soft tissue and 20.6% in the case of the bone. Besides, also the dose delivered
to the surrounding outer volume reduces.

The net eﬀect due to the presence of both gel in the inner volume and soft tissue or bone in the craniopharyngioma,
in relation to the case in which only water is considered, is shown in panels (e) and (f ) of Fig. 3. The dose rate
delivered to the cyst wall reduces in 20.0%, in the case of the soft tissue, and 42.9% in the case of bone. Even if we can
expect that the craniopharyngioma is composed of a material with an intermediate density, the dose rate delivered
to both, the cyst wall and the outer volume nearby it, would be strongly reduced in relation to what it is obtained
using the Loevinger approach.

FIG. 4: Eﬀect of the Bremsstrahlung radiation for the case in which gel and bone are present in the inner volume and the wall
of the craniopharyngioma, respectively. Black squares give the dose rate obtained when Bremsstrahlung mechanism is switched
oﬀ. Open squares correspond to the full calculation.

The presence of materials with densities larger than that of water, could make the Bremsstrahlung eﬀect more
important. As before, we have carried out a new simulation (for the case in which gel and bone are present in
the inner volume and in the wall of the craniopharyngioma, respectively), but we switched oﬀ the Bremsstrahlung
mechanism. In Fig. 4 the results obtained (black squares) are compared to those of the full calculation (open squares).
These results are rather similar to those found for the case of a unique medium (see lower panel in Fig. 2), except
for two details. First, the Bremsstrahlung eﬀect begins to be observed in the radiation queue at a slightly shorter
distance, ∼ 2.2 cm. Second, the inclusion of Bremsstrahlung eﬀects produces an increase of the dose delivered to the
cyst wall which reaches the non negligible value of ∼ 45%. If we compare the simulation without Bremsstrahlung with
the analytical approaches which, as mentioned previously, do not treat this eﬀect in an adequate way, the reduction
observed for the dose delivered to the cyst wall would be even larger.

At this point, it is necessary to clarify how the previous conclusions are related to the choice of the geometry. For
this reason we have performed a set of calculations similar to the previous ones but assuming diﬀerent thicknesses for
the tumor wall and diﬀerent sizes for the inner volume.

First we have analyzed the eﬀect of the wall thickness and we have considered δ = 2 and 3 mm. The relative
diﬀerences ∆v
(cyst) obtained are shown in Table III for diﬀerent materials and conﬁgurations. As we can see,
β
the eﬀect of the presence of the soft tissue is rather small, increasing the dose delivered to the cyst by ∼ 1% (see third
column). On the contrary, the fact that the wall is made of bone produces a considerable reduction of the dose rate
in it. Besides, this reduction grows with the thickness of the cyst wall (see fourth column).

The eﬀect of the presence of the gel in the inner volume seems to be almost independent of the thickness of the

wall producing a reduction of ∼ 20% in all cases (see ﬁfth and sixth columns).

Finally, the combined eﬀect of soft tissue in the wall and of the gel in the inner volume (seventh column) is practically
equal to that of the gel alone, while in the case of bone (eight column), the reduction increases with the wall thickness,
following the behavior observed when no gel was considered. It is worth to point out that the dose rate delivered to
the cyst can be diminished by more than 50%.

To study the inﬂuence of the inner volume of the craniopharyngioma we have considered two diﬀerent values of its
radius: R = 1 and 2.5 cm. In both calculations we have maintained the activity concentration of 1 MBq cm−3. The
results obtained in the simulations are shown in the two last rows of Table III. As we can see, the values of the relative
diﬀerences are very similar to those found for the former calculation (R = 1.75 cm, δ = 1 mm). This indicates that
the important parameter is the thickness of the cyst wall. The reduction of the dose delivered to it becomes bigger
with the increase of the thickness.

B.

βγ sources

After having analyzed the case of pure β sources, we studied βγ sources. To perform the calculations we have
considered the 186Re radionuclide which has the decay scheme shown in Fig. 5 [18]. Following Ref.
[19], in order
to simplify the simulation, we considered only the most relevant transitions, whose properties are given in Table IV.

FIG. 5: Decay scheme of the 186Re radionuclide. In actual simulations, only the β decays populating the ground and the ﬁrst
excited state of the 186Os, the γ decays shown with solid lines as well as the X-rays and IC and Auger electrons mentioned in
the text have been considered.

In this table, we show for X-rays, internal conversion (IC) and Auger electrons (these last two have been grouped)
the average values of the energies and the intensities. The two β decays considered are ﬁrst forbidden (not unique).
However, the sampling procedure [16] is the same as for allowed transitions.

As in the previous case, we assumed a source of R = 1.75 cm with δ = 1 mm and an activity concentration of

1 MBq cm−3 introduced in the inner volume of the craniopharyngioma.

We began by comparing to the theoretical predictions based on the Loevinger and Berger approaches, our MC

simulations, done by assuming a unique medium (water).

For the β decay with Emax

β = 1.069 MeV, the mean energy is Eβ = 0.362 MeV and the parameters entering in the
Loevinger formula are c = 1.5 and ν = 17.78 cm2 g−1. For that with Emax
β = 0.932 MeV, we used Eβ = 0.309 MeV,
c = 1.5 and ν = 21.61 cm2 g−1. The results corresponding to ˙Dww
β (x) are shown in Fig. 6. The calculations have
been done by using the absolute intensities given in Table IV. As we can see, the simulation (dots) and the analytical
calculation (solid lines) show a good agreement, as it happened in the case of 32P.

The results obtained for the remaining radiations in Table IV are shown in Fig. 7. Also in these results, the absolute
intensities of each radiation are included. For photons (these are the four γ emissions and the X-rays), the results
of the simulations (dots) are compared with those provided by the analytical approach of Berger (solid lines). The
parameters entering in Eq. (A11), and given in Table V, have been obtained by performing cubic interpolations of
the values quoted in Ref. [9]. It is remarkable the excellent agreement between the analytical approach and the MC
simulation. It is also worth to notice that the γ emissions with Eγ = 137.16 keV and the X-ray of W and Os are the
most important contributions here, while the other emissions are more than one order of magnitude smaller.

In Fig. 7 we also show the results the IC and Auger electrons (diamonds). These phenomena cannot be described

FIG. 6: Same as Fig. 2 but for the two main β decays of 186Re. Only the Loevinger approach results are shown. The absolute
intensities of both emissions are included.

FIG. 7: Same as Fig. 2 but for the main γ and X-ray radiations of 186Re. Solid curves show the result obtained from the
Berger approach. The absolute intensities of the diﬀerent emissions are included.

by the analytical approaches considered here but, in any case, their contribution seems to be negligible.

In Fig. 8 we show the separate contributions of the electrons, say β emissions, IC and Auger electrons (squares),
and of the photons, γ emissions and X-rays (triangles). The solid curve corresponds to the analytical calculation
performed by summing the contributions obtained with the Loevinger approach for the two β emissions and with
the Berger approach for the γ emissions and the X-rays. As we can see it provides a rather good description of the
simulated results. Besides, it is worth to point out that the dose delivered to the craniopharyngioma is mainly due
to the β radiation, the photon contribution being two orders of magnitude smaller. On the contrary, the dose due to
electrons becomes more than one order of magnitude smaller than the one delivered by γ emissions and X-rays for
x > 2 cm, that is at distances above 2 mm far from the outside surface of the craniopharyngioma.

Finally, we have tested the eﬀect of the diﬀerent materials and interfaces in the dosimetry. First, we have evaluated
the dose rate by assuming gel in the inner volume of the craniopharyngioma. The results corresponding to the relative

Full spectrum

TABLE VI: Relative diﬀerences in %, as given by Eq. (10), for the diﬀerent radiations of 186Re. Here R = 1.75 cm and
δ = 1 mm. Last row gives the results for the full spectrum of 186Re considered in this paper. The energies given for the β− are
the endpoint energies.

diﬀerences, as given by Eq. (10), are those in the third column of Table VI. In this table we also show the values for
each of the radiations considered in the spectrum of the 186Re and, in the last row, for the full spectrum (by including
the proper absolute intensities). As we can see, the presence of the gel produces a reduction of the dose delivered to
the cyst wall. This reduction is of ∼ 20% for the β emissions and for the IC and Auger electrons. The reduction, no
greater than 2%, is very small for γ and X-ray radiations. The full eﬀect of the gel is 20.3% reduction, as expected
due to the dominance of the β radiations previously discussed.

In a second step we have studied the eﬀect of the material forming the cyst wall. We have checked that, as it
happened for the 32P radionuclide, the presence of soft tissue, instead of water, produces negligible modiﬁcations. In
the last column of Table VI we show the results obtained when compact bone is assumed to constitute the cyst wall.
As we can see, the reduction of the dose delivered to the cyst reaches more than 50% for the β, IC and Auger electron
emissions. However, the behavior for γ radiations is diﬀerent. While for the more energetic photons the dose reduces
(less than 5%), it increases considerably for the less energetic ones, with an enormous enhancement (more than 200%)
for X-rays. In any case, the dominance of the β emissions on the full spectrum is again remarkable.

The average energies of the β emissions in this radionuclide are smaller than these of 32P. This implies that
Bremsstrahlung eﬀect is less important in this case. On the other hand, we have check that the Bremsstrahlung eﬀect
for the γ emissions is negligible, the dose rates obtained without Bremsstrahlung overlapping with those found in the
full calculation.

To ﬁnish, we compare the integral dose rates (see Eq. (11)) delivered by the two radionuclides here considered inside
the cyst wall. In the case of a unique medium (water) and assuming the same radionuclide concentration injected in
the inner volume of the cyst, the dose rate deposited in the wall by the 198Re is 33% smaller than the one due to 32P.

FIG. 8: Same as Fig. 2 but for the full spectrum emission of 186Re. The separate contribution of the β emission plus IC and
Auger electrons (squares) and that of γ plus X-rays (triangles) are shown. Solid curve shows the analytical result obtained
from the Loevinger and Berger approaches.

When we consider the cyst ﬁlled with gel and the cyst shell made of bone, the dose rate of 198Re is 25% smaller than
that of 32P.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have investigated the dosimetry for radiocolloid therapy of cystic craniopharyngiomas. The
craniopharyngioma has been described as a spherical shell with given internal radius and thickness. Diﬀerent materials
have been considered to form the colloid introduced in the craniopharyngioma and the shell representing the cyst
wall. Explicit analytical expressions for the dose rate due to β and γ emitters have been obtained on the base of the
well known Loevinger and Berger formulae for point sources. Results for 32P and 186Re are quoted.

The results obtained with these analytical expressions, valid under the assumption of a unique medium, have been
compared with calculations performed with the Monte Carlo simulation code PENELOPE. These calculations show
a nice agreement for both β and γ emissions in the two radionuclides studied.

By using the Monte Carlo simulation, the role of the diﬀerent materials and of the interfaces present in the problem,

has been investigated. The main conclusions we draw are the following ones.

1. The eﬀect of the material forming the colloid (gel in our case) produces a reduction of ∼ 20% of the dose
delivered to the cyst wall by β and IC and Auger electron emissions. This reduction is smaller than 2% for γ
and X-ray emissions.

2. There are no noticeable diﬀerences between the results obtained when soft tissue or water are considered to

form the cyst wall.

3. The consideration of compact bone as the material forming the cyst wall gives rise to relevant eﬀects. For β
and IC and Auger electron emissions, the dose delivered to the cyst wall reduces by a factor larger than 25%.
This eﬀect together with that produced by the colloid makes this dose to be reduced by more than 40%. For γ
and X-ray emissions, the presence of the bone in the cyst wall appears to be very important for energies below
200 keV. In this situation, the dose delivered to the cyst wall increases by more than 200% in the case of the

X-rays of 65 keV we have considered. For the 186Re the dominant emissions are β radiations, and they obscure
this enormous eﬀect.

4. All the eﬀects quoted above, do not change with the size (inner radius) of the craniopharyngioma, but increase

with its thickness, which appear to be the relevant parameter to consider in the dosimetry.

APPENDIX A: FORMULAE FOR SPHERICAL UNIFORM SOURCES

In this appendix we discuss the procedure to calculate analytically the integral in Eq. (1) for the point dose rates

corresponding to the Loevinger and Berger approaches.

In the ﬁrst case, and taking into account Eq. (2), the dose rate per activity unit at a distance x from the center of

the distribution can be written as

FIG. 9: Geometrical scheme to calculate the integrals of the Loevinger and Berger formulae for an extended spherical source
uniformly distributed.

The key point to evaluate the corresponding integrals is to ﬁx the center of the coordinate system on the target
point. The scheme is represented in Fig. 9. In the case of the integral I1(x), one has to consider that T1(x) has a
range t (see Eq. (3)). Thus, the only contribution to the integral comes from points inside the source distribution
and sited at a distance s ≤ t from the target point. Therefore, only the shadowed volume shown in Fig. 9 contributes
to I1(x) and we have

I1(x) =

ds T1(s) =

ds s2 T1(s)

The angle θmax is the value reached by θ when |x − s| = R and then

.

Considering the above equations, the integral (A3) becomes

Here, the Θ(x−R) factor indicates that the calculation is valid for points outside the distribution, while the Θ(R+t−x)
factor points out the fact that this contribution cancels for x values larger than R + t. The result of the integration is

I1(x) =

12x − 11t + 4(t − R) exp

I1(R) =

{4R [3 − exp(1)] − t [11 − 4 exp(1)]} .

To calculate the contribution I2(x), a similar procedure is followed. Now, the full source distribution contributes

and this implies that in Eq. (A5) we must change the upper limit in the integral to x + R. Thus one has

I2(x) = −

For γ emitters, the integral in Eq. (1) is evaluated for the point dose rate given by the Berger approach (6). In this
case, Jγ(x) has no range and the calculation follows the same steps as those for the T2 term of the Loevinger formula.
Thus one can write

Substituting Eqs. (6) and (7) here one has

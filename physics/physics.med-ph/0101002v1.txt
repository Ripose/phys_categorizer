Abstract

Previously we have developed a free boundary model for local ther-
mal coagulation induced by laser light absorption when the tissue region
aﬀected directly by laser light is suﬃciently small and heat diﬀusion into
the surrounding tissue governs the necrosis growth. In the present paper
surveying the obtained results we state the point of view on the necrosis
formation under these conditions as the basis of an individual laser ther-
apy mode exhibiting speciﬁc properties. In particular, roughly speaking,
the size of the resulting necrosis domain is determined by the physical
characteristics of the tissue and its response to local heating, and by the
applicator form rather than the treatment duration and the irradiation
power.

1 What the heat diﬀusion limited tissue coag-
ulation is: a phenomenon and a theoretical
problem

Thermal coagulation of living tissue caused by local heating due to laser light
absorption is one of the novel thermotherapy techniques of tumor treatment
which is currently undergoing clinical trials (see, e.g., [1]). Thermal coagula-
tion is used to form a necrosis domain of desired form for the removal of the

malignant tissue. So the mathematical modeling of the necrosis growth is re-
quired, ﬁrst, to ﬁnd out the physical limitations and the basic characteristics
of the treatment and, second, to optimize the therapy course. However, living
tissue is extremely complex in structure, thereby, for the adequate theoretical
model to be developed and for the mathematical modeling of the given process
to be implemented reliably typical limit cases should be singled out and studied
individually. Such a case is the subject of the present paper.

When the tissue region aﬀected directly by laser light is suﬃciently small is
size, the necrosis formation is mainly governed by heat diﬀusion. Namely, in this
case we actually deal with the following physical process (Fig. 1). Absorption
of laser light delivered into a small internal region of living tissue causes the
temperature to attain such high values (about or above 70 ◦C) that lead prac-
tically to immediate thermal coagulation in this region. Heat diﬀusion into the
surrounding live tissue causes its further coagulation, giving rise to the growth
of the necrosis domain. In this case heat diﬀusion plays a signiﬁcant role in
the necrosis growth because the necrosis size
exceeds the depth of laser light
penetration into the tissue. Therefore, the temperature distribution inevitably
has to be substantially nonuniform and for the tissue to coagulate at periph-
eral points heat diﬀusion should cause the temperature to grow at these points.
The latter property singles out the speciﬁc mode of thermal coagulation under
discussion from other possible types of thermotherapy treatment and that is
why we refer to the necrosis growth under the given conditions as to thermal
tissue coagulation limited by heat diﬀusion. In particular, as will be seen below,
the optimal implementation of this thermotherapy mode is characterized by the
5–10 mm and by the treatment du-
formation of necrosis domains of size
10−3 cm2/sec is the tissue
ration of tcourse
temperature diﬀusivity). Laser lighted is considered to be absorbed within a

Heat diﬀusion in the live tissue is aﬀected substantially by blood perfusion
causing the heat sink [2, 3]. Thus, the characteristics of the spatial distribution
and the dynamics of the blood perfusion rate should have a substantial eﬀect
on the necrosis growth limited by heat diﬀusion. Therefore, in modeling mode
one has to take into account the tissue response to the temperature growth
which can locally give rise to a tenfold increase in the blood perfusion rate [4].
The latter eﬀect, in particular, is responsible for a substantially nonuniform
distribution of the blood perfusion rate and visually manifests itself in a red
ring (“hyperemic ring”) appearing around the necrosis region during the ther-
motherapy treatment. Besides, when heated the living tissue will inevitably
exhibit spatial nonuniformities in the temperature due to the vessel discreteness
[5]. Because of the extremely strong temperature dependence of the thermal co-
agulation rate such temperature nonuniformities can substantially perturb the
necrosis form and, so, this eﬀect should be also taken into account.

In the previous papers [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] basing on the free
boundary description we have developed a model for the heat diﬀusion lim-
ited thermal tissue coagulation and studied the properties of the corresponding
necrosis growth. This model has been developed in order to take into account
the eﬀects mentioned above. The aim of the present paper is to survey the ob-
tained results, to outline the general properties of the necrosis growth under the
aforementioned conditions, and to justify the point of view on the laser induced
heat diﬀusion limited tissue coagulation as a individual mode of laser therapy.
However, before stating the free boundary model let us, ﬁrst, recall the main
features of living tissue aﬀecting heat transfer, discuss the approach previously
used by other authors and analyze the corresponding problems in the theoretical
description of the local thermal coagulation. In this way we will make the key
points of the theory we have developed more clear.

1.1 Background: the main features of bioheat transfer

1.1.1 Living tissue as a heterogeneous medium

Blood ﬂowing through vessels in living tissue forms paths of fast heat transport
and under typical conditions it is blood ﬂow that governs heat propagation on
scales exceeding several millimeters (for an introduction to this problem see,
e.g., [3, 15]). Blood vessels make up a complex network being practically a
fractal. The larger is a vessel, the faster is the blood motion in it and, so,
the stronger is the eﬀect of blood ﬂux in the given vessel on heat transfer.
The blood ﬂux in the smallest vessels, capillaries, practically does not aﬀect
heat propagation [3]. Thus, there should be blood vessels of a certain length
ℓv that are the smallest among the vessels wherein the blood ﬂux aﬀects heat
transfer remarkably. The value of ℓv may be diﬀerent at various points (under
nonuniform blood perfusion) and can be found from the expression [16] (see also

Here κ is the thermal conductivity of the cellular tissue, c, ρ are the density

value averaged over scales of order of ℓv(r). The factor f < 1 accounts for

where l/a is the mean ratio of the individual length to radius of blood vessels
forming peripheral systems of blood circulation. Since expression (1) estimating
the length ℓv contains the blood perfusion rate jv itself averaged over the scale
ℓv, it is implicit and has to be completed with an expression relating the value
ℓv(r), the averaged perfusion rate jv(r) and the true one j(r). At ﬁrst, we write
it in a symbolic form

Nevertheless, to estimate the length ℓv we may ignore the diﬀerence between the

The theory of heat transfer in living tissue (bioheat transfer theory) starts
from the system of microscopic equations governing heat propagation in the
cellular tissue and with blood inside the vessels individually. However, on one
hand, the complex structure of the vascular network and, on the other hand,
the lack of the detailed information about the arrangement of individual vessels
necessitate the development of the macroscopic description of heat transfer in
living tissue regarded as an eﬀective continuum with certain, may be, anoma-
lous properties. Moreover, the vascular network can vary in particular details
from tissue to tissue or even from patient to patient for one tissue. In this case
the development of an adequate macroscopic theory is the only way to model
a thermotherapy treatment. The macroscopic governing equation for the tissue
temperature can be obtained by averaging the microscopic equations over cer-
tain scales that, ﬁrst, are small enough so the tissue temperature does not exhibit

4

great variation on these scales. Second, these scales should be large enough for
the heat exchange between the cellular tissue and blood could be treated within
a continuous approximation. This heat exchange is directly controlled by the
vessels of length ℓv. So the length ℓv is a natural scale of the averaging in the
theory of bioheat transfer. Besides, it turns out that the characteristic scale of
the temperature variations is

The latter estimate demonstrates us that the value 1/Ln plays the role of small
parameter in the bioheat transfer theory, exactly which has made it feasible to
construct a mean ﬁeld approximation regarding living tissue as a continuum
[16].

In particular, averaging the microscopic equations in this way, we have got
the following macroscopic bioheat equation relating the tissue temperature Tv
averaged over scales of order of ℓv and the averaged perfusion rate jv:

where we have ignored the diﬀerence in the density and heat capacity of the

tissue and blood, respectively, c
large arteries of systemic circulation is considered to be ﬁxed, and qv is the
heat generation rate averaged over the same scales. The factor f , accounting
for the counter-current eﬀect, and the ratio F = κeﬀ/κ are estimated by the
expressions:

f

(7)

It should be pointed out that the factors f and F are determined solely by
the geometry of the vascular network, which directly results from the vascu-
lar network being fractal in structure 1. Moreover, due to the logarithmically
weak dependence (2) these factors can be approximately treated as constants
determined beforehand.

It should be noted that blood ﬂow through the large arteries can give rise
to an anomalously fast heat transport over scales much greater than ℓT . Under
certain conditions it may appear that the eﬀective thermal conductivity κeﬀ
exceeds the thermal conductivity of the cellular tissue by tenfold due to this
eﬀect. However, such a fast heat transport cannot be described in terms of
the mean ﬁeld theory and deserves an individual consideration. Besides, on the
average, its role is not too essential because of the suﬃciently small relative
volume of the large arteries. Therefore dealing with local thermal coagulation
1The theoretical estimate of f ∼ 0.5 has been obtained for the ﬁrst time in book [16],
announced in our papers [6, 8] and has been later presented independently in paper [21].
The eﬀect of blood perfusion on the heat propagation rate in terms of the heat conductivity
renormalization was quantitatively studied actually for the ﬁrst time in paper [22]

we can ignore this eﬀect at the ﬁrst approximation. We also point out that
equation (6) is similar in its form to the phenomenological generalized bioheat
equation [23] except for the latter contains the true perfusion rate j rather than
the averaged one jv. This fact can be essential for substantially nonuniform
blood perfusion [16] as it is the case in local thermal coagulation [6, 8].

The mean ﬁeld approximation leading to equation (6) does not allow for
the temperature nonuniformities caused by the vessel discreteness [5] because
it regards living tissue as a certain continuum. So, to take into account these
nonuniformities we have to go beyond the scope of the mean ﬁeld theory. Since
the particular details of the vessel arrangement on scales about several millime-
ters are practically unknown and, moreover, alter in various tissues and, may be,
at diﬀerent points of one tissue it is reasonable to regard the vessel arrangement
and the corresponding temperature nonuniformities as random [24]. In particu-
lar, under uniform heating, i.e. when Tv is constant, these nonuniformities will
be characterized by the mean amplitude σ and the correlation length λ:

In this subsection we have discussed the characteristic features of living tissue
as a heterogeneous medium. However it is also an active medium because it
responds to temperature variations by increasing the blood vessel radius, which
gives rise to an increase in the blood perfusion rate j. The blood perfusion rate
can locally grow by tenfold [4], so, this eﬀect is signiﬁcant and is the subject of
the next subsection.

Living tissue tries to keep its temperature from exceeding a certain vital bound-
44–46 ◦C (T < T+) to prevent thermal damage (see, e.g., [25]). So,
ary T+
the main increase in the blood perfusion rate j should fall on the temperature
T+ and after the temperature ex-
variations from Ta to a certain value Tvr
ceeds the value Tvr the blood perfusion rate j is likely to depend weakly on
temperature because the blood vessels exhaust their ability to expand.

≈

In order to analyze the temperature evolution in living tissue the dependence
j(T ) obtained experimentally under practically uniform heating of large tissue
regions is typically used. However, whether such a dependence holds when the
temperature distribution becomes substantially nonuniform is a question. In-
deed, in this case due to the vessel extent the dependence j(T ) can alter not only
its particular form but also become functional. In other words, when the tissue
is heated substantially nonuniform the blood perfusion rate j(r) at a given point
r is determined, in general, by the whole temperature distribution
over
a certain neighborhood of this point (concerning a similar behavior of the tissue
response to variations in CO2 concentration see, e.g., [20]). Speciﬁc details of
the mechanism by which living tissue responds to local temperature variations
on scales about 1 cm is also a question [20]. However, under strong heating
localized on such scales thermal selfregulation can be eﬀectively implemented
through the response of microcirculatory bed to reduced O2 partial pressure or
increased concentration of metabolism products (e.g. CO2, H+, ADP, etc.) be-
cause higher temperatures result in a metabolism intensiﬁcation with a higher
O2 consumption. In addition, this explains a possible delay of the tissue re-
sponse to temperature variations and enables the corresponding delay time to
be estimated at several minutes (see, e.g., [20]).

T (r′)
}

{

In order to describe the local thermoregulation we need to specify how each
vessel responds to the corresponding piece of information characterizing the
state of the tissue, in particular, its temperature. So, in deriving the equa-
tion relating the blood perfusion rate j(r, t) to the tissue temperature T (r, t)
we make use of the following physiological data [20]. The local selfregulation
of blood perfusion in living tissue on scales about one centimeter is due to
expansion or contraction of blood vessels making up a single microcirculatory
bed and blood redistribution over this vascular network is mainly controlled by
a large group of arteries diﬀering in length signiﬁcantly. The reaction of the
microcirculatory bed is governed by receptors responding to variations in CO2
partial pressure, H+ concentration, or other metabolism products. However,
as mentioned above, under strong heating such receptors can play the role of
eﬀective thermoreceptors supplying the microcirculatory bed with the needed
information. Obviously, none of the vessels receives the whole information on
the tissue state, so there must be a certain cooperative mechanism of informa-
tion self-processing by which the behavior of diﬀerent vessels is consistent with
each other in the manner enabling the tissue to respond properly.

We have shown [16, 26, 27, 28] that such a cooperative mechanism of self-
regulation can be implemented through the vessel response to the blood tem-

7

perature in the corresponding veins. The receptors mentioned above are located
directly in the cellular tissue as well as embedded into the walls of vessels, in-
cluding veins [20]. Those embedded into the vessel walls are able to measure
the concentration of the metabolism products directly in blood and, thus, to
measure eﬀectively its temperature. For small vessels (arteries and veins) the
position of the receptors governing their behavior is not a factor. This allows
us to make use of the proposed cooperative mechanism of self-regulation in the
description of tissue response to local and strong heating.

Under the adopted assumptions it turns out that for the normal tissue the
dependence of blood perfusion rate j on the tissue temperature T can be approx-
imately described by a local equation relating the values of j(r) and T (r) taken
at the same point r until the temperature comes close to the vital boundary T+.
This is due to the cooperative mechanism of selfregulation which involves the
individual response of each vessel to the corresponding piece of information and
the coordination of their behavior by the selfprocessing of information. The ad-
equate selfprocessing of information is implemented through heat conservation
during blood motion inside relatively large veins of the microcirculatory bed.
The vascular network whose behavior is governed by this mechanism can supply
each region of the cellular tissue with blood at such a rate that is required of its
individual demand and diﬀerent regions of the cellular tissue do not interfere
with one other. The obtained equation for the tissue response is of the form
[16, 26, 27, 28]:

(13)

where τ v is the delay time of tissue response and j0 is the blood perfusion rate
provided the tissue is not aﬀected. This result practically holds for living tissue
containing also a small necrosis domain [16, 29] because the temperature of
blood in veins whose length exceeds its size by several times is not sensitive to
the presence of necrosis domain.

In the next subsection we analyze the models of local thermal coagulation
used previously by other authors and discuss the basic theoretical problems met
in such approaches.

1.2 Distributed description of thermal coagulation

The eﬀect of heat diﬀusion on local thermal coagulation has been considered
and numerically simulated by a number of authors (see, e.g.
[30, 31, 32] and
references therein). Leaving aside the description of laser light propagation
in the tissue we can generalize their models for the necrosis formation to the
following coupled equations for the temperature ﬁeld T (r, t) and the ﬁeld ζ(r, t)
determining the fraction of undamaged tissue at a given point r and time t:

T and for typical values of temperature attained during the treatment course
can be approximated by the expression

Expression (16) is actually a convenient approximation of the Arrhenius de-
inside a not wide temperature interval governing
pendence ω(T )
the tissue coagulation. The available experimental data [33] for the tempera-
ture dependence of the exposure time enable us to estimate the value of ∆ as
3.6 ◦C for pig liver at T0 = 65 ◦C). Below in numerical

In what follows the system of equations (14), (15), and expression (16) will
be referred to as the “distributed model” for local thermal coagulation. This
model in fact is rather a phenomenological one and should be modiﬁed in order
to allow for sophisticated eﬀects revealing themselves in local coagulation.

Let us consider the properties of local thermal coagulation that, in fact,
make the mathematical description of this process stubborn and give rise to the
inconsistency of the distributed model. During a typical course of thermother-
100◦C are attained at
apy treatment high temperatures of order of Tmax
∼
37 ◦C. Under such
the necrosis center, whereas at distant points T = Ta
conditions the damage rate ω(T ) or its reciprocal value tcg(T ) = 1/ω(T ) called
the threshold exposure time of thermal coagulation varies extremely sharp in
. Indeed, at points where the temperature
space on scales of the necrosis size
attains, for example, the values of T = 60 ◦C, 65 ◦C, 70 ◦C, and 75 ◦C the val-
ues of tcg are 8 min, 100, 20, and 5 sec, respectively [33]. The typical duration
tcourse of the thermotherapy course is about several minutes and estimated by
the inequality, tcourse & τ [6, 8], where

the blood perfusion rate attained near the necrosis boundary. In estimate (18)
we have set f = 0.5 and used the typical values of the blood perfusion rate
0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 min−1 for stomach, intestine, and spleen, respectively [34].
j

So the layer wherein the thermal coagulation is under way at a given moment
of time is characterized by a narrow temperature interval of thickness ∆ located
65 ◦C. This layer Lpd of partially
in the vicinity of the temperature of Tcg

(ζ
coagulation in the framework of the distributed model one has to consider in
detail the temperature ﬁeld inside the layer Lpd, because exactly it governs the
necrosis growth directly.

Now we estimate the thickness δpd of this layer. As follows from the nu-
merical analysis [6, 8] the temperature distribution is characterized by a single
spatial scale, so, in the necrosis domain the mean temperature gradient is about
. In addition, the necrosis size attaining typically the

So the layer Lpd of partially damaged tissue is suﬃciently thin, its thickness
is less not only than the mean necrosis size
but also, what is essential for
the theory development, than the characteristic length ℓv of the vessels directly
governing the heat exchange between the cellular tissue and blood. Therefore,
in order to describe rigorously the temperature distribution on scales about δpd
we have to go beyond the framework of the mean ﬁeld approximation. However,
the distributed model is, in fact, a mean ﬁeld one, because it regards living tissue
in terms of an eﬀective continuum. Thereby the distributed model in its own
right cannot ensure the reliability for the mathematical modeling of local tissue
coagulation.

In particular, as an aspect of this problem we note that the mean ﬁeld ap-
proximation ignores the diﬀerence between the true temperature distribution in
the tissue and the temperature ﬁeld T (r, t), i.e. does not take into account the
random component of temperature distribution caused by the vessel discrete-
ness. This is justiﬁed if the mean amplitude σ of such temperature nonuniformi-
ties is suﬃciently small. By virtue of (4) and setting the temperature inside the
65 ◦C we get the estimate
layer Lpd of partially damaged tissue equal to Tcg

≈

(21)

σ

∆ .

Lpd ∼
|
In other words, inside the layer Lpd the amplitude of the temperature nonuni-
formities due to the vessel discreteness turns out to be about the characteristic
temperature drop across the whole layer Lpd. So such temperature nonunifor-
mities are bound to aﬀect the necrosis formation.

Another problem inherent in the distributed model is the speciﬁcation of
the main kinetic coeﬃcients characterizing the partially damaged tissue as a
continuous medium that eﬀectively approximates the real cellular tissue with
the embedded vascular network, with both of them having undergone partial
damage. Namely, we should specify the eﬀective thermal conductivity κeﬀ and

10

the factor f as functions of the blood perfusion rate j and the fraction ζ of
undamaged tissue:

κeﬀ = κeﬀ(ζ, j) ,

f = f (ζ, j) .

(22)

≈

However, these coeﬃcients being the characteristics of the mean ﬁeld theory can
adequately describe heat transfer in living tissue only on scales about or greater
than ℓv. So we may write the corresponding relationships only for the live tissue
where ζ
1. (Clearly, inside the necrosis domain κeﬀ = κ and we may set f
equal to any value of order unity because of j = 0 in this region.) Inside the
layer of partially damaged tissue any dependence of the type κeﬀ = κeﬀ(ζ) or
f = f (ζ) is nothing more than a formal phenomenological approximation of a
real complicated phenomenon. In particular, as follows from the results to be
obtained the particular details of the dependence f = f (ζ) are of no concern
and below we will treat the value f as a constant.

Besides, in order to complete the distributed model one should describe how
the blood perfusion rate depends on the undamaged tissue fraction ζ and the
temperature. It has been proposed [31] to set

j(ζ, T ) = ζjt(T ) ,

(23)

where jt(T ) is the perfusion rate that would occur in tissue without damage.
Clearly, it is also a pure phenomenological approximation.

The only fact, that is able to justify the feasibility of applying the distributed
model to the analysis of local thermal coagulation can be the independence of
the necrosis growth from the particular details of heat transfer in the layer of
partially damaged tissue. In this case, however, it would be more consistent to
use a free boundary model which ignores the thickness of this layer, i.e. treats it
as the boundary of the necrosis domain. The motion of such an interface must be
governed by the boundary values of the temperature and its gradient. Particular
details of heat transfer in the given layer may be taken into consideration by a
certain collection of parameters.

In the next section we will show that this independence is the case and
derive the corresponding free boundary model. In particular, formally assuming
equation (14) to hold in the whole region under consideration we will reduce
the system of equations (14), (15) to a certain equivalent free boundary model
dealing with integrated characteristics of the tissue damage rate inside the layer
Lpd. In other words, the model to be obtained aggregates the particular details
of the functions κeﬀ(ζ) and j(ζ, T ) to certain contains of order unity, which
demonstrates the desired independence.

2 Interface dynamics

In order to obtain the free boundary description of local thermal coagulation it
is suﬃce to consider a certain neighborhood Q of the partially damaged tissue
layer Lpd (Fig. 2). The size of the region Q is assumed to be, on one hand, much

11

of the necrosis domain and, on the other
smaller than the characteristic size
hand, much larger than the thickness δpd of the layer Lpd. In other words, we
analyze the case when the tissue in the region aﬀected directly by laser light has
already coagulated and the necrosis growth is caused by the heat diﬀusion into
the surrounding tissue. To describe the dynamic of local thermal coagulation
we introduce the interface Γ speciﬁed by the condition

ℜ

There are two ways of deriving the desired expression for the velocity ϑn.
One of them is as follows. Let us, ﬁrst, assume equations (14), (15) to hold
at all the points of the tissue. Then the derivation is to reduce the distributed
model to certain equations dealing with the layer Lpd of partially damaged
tissue in terms of an interface Γ whose velocity ϑn is determined by the local
characteristics of the temperature ﬁeld that practically do not vary over this
layer and so remains unchanged at the nearest points of the live tissue and the
necrosis region. This way has been implemented in our papers [7, 11] using
the singular perturbation technique in the small parameter ∆/(Tmax
Ta). In
particular, we have obtained the following expression relating the velocity ϑn
of the interface Γ, the value Tcg of the temperature at this interface, and the
boundary value of the temperature gradient, for example, on the necrosis side

where the function ω(T ) is the thermal coagulation rate given by formula (16)

(26)

The other way of obtaining expression (25) is to state it basing on the general
properties of thermal coagulation and without using the distributed model at all.
Doing so we are not be able to get an expression for the constant
0 and, thereby,
should regard it as a phenomenological one. However, ﬁrst, expression (26) is as
rigorous as the former approach using the dependence κeﬀ(ζ). Second, following
the latter way we show that the free boundary model based on expression (25) is
more general than the distributed model, i.e. it is not restricted to the validity
area of the distributed model.

Let thermal coagulation be under way in a layer Lpd(t) at a given moment
of time t and the mean temperature and the mean temperature gradient inside
this layer be Tcg and
nTpd, respectively. Then the characteristic thickness δpd
of the layer Lpd can be estimated by expression

∇
In fact, when the necrosis growth due to thermal coagulation is limited by the
heat diﬀusion the temperature distribution is substantially nonuniform in space.
Therefore, on one hand, in the necrosis region, where the temperature exceeds
Tcg by values greater than ∆: (T
ω(Tcg), the
tissue coagulation has to be completed. On the other hand, in the region of
T & ∆, and, so,
undamaged tissue the temperature is suﬃciently low, Tcg
ω(T )
ω(Tcg), thereby the tissue has not enough time to coagulate at such
temperatures. Therefore tissue coagulation can be under way only in the region
. ∆ whence we immediately get estimate (27). After a lapse
where
1/ω(Tcg) the tissue in the layer Lpd has to coagulate
of the time interval t thr
practically completely. This is equivalent to the displacement of the layer Lpd
over the distance δpd. Thereby, if we keep watch on the points at which ζ
0.5
then we will see that these points move at the velocity

The other relation completing the free boundary approximation of the necro-
sis growth reﬂects the heat ﬂux conservation through the layer Lpd of partially
damaged tissue. Obviously, it can be represented in the form

relating the temperature gradients
on the necrosis side and the side of live tissue, respectively.

Figure 3: The necrosis growth due to local thermal coagulation limited by heat
diﬀusion. The physical system under consideration.

Expressions (25), (28) are actually the essence of the free boundary model
for the dynamics of local thermal coagulation. It should be pointed out that
the stated free boundary approximation in its turn can be regarded as the
initial point of modeling the necrosis growth due to local thermal coagulation.
Indeed, all the information required of specifying the dependence ϑn(T ) can
be obtained based on the experimental data for the temperature dependence
of the threshold exposure time at ﬁxed temperature. The only parameter of
this model that contains the particular information about the properties of heat
transfer in the real layer of partially damaged tissue is the numeric factor
0
ℑ
of order unity,
1. Keeping the latter in mind we may regard the analysis
presented in the given section as the substantiation of the fact that the necrosis
growth due to local thermal coagulation limited by heat diﬀusion is insensitive
to the particular details of heat transfer inside partially damaged tissue. Thus,
it actually justiﬁes the distributed model rather than the free boundary model.
Now the obtained results (25), (28) enable us to state the desired free bound-

3 Free boundary model

Following the previous section the tissue is considered as comprising two regions
(Fig. 3), the necrosis domain Qn where the blood perfusion rate is equal to zero,

j(r, t) = 0 for

r

Qn ,

∈

(29)

and the undamaged tissue Qt responding to temperature variations by increas-
ing locally the blood perfusion rate j(r, t). Besides, we allow for that the tissue
response can be delayed. Blood vessels can expand only to a certain extent as
the temperature grows. So when it becomes high enough, T > Tvr, the blood

14

perfusion rate j(r, t) attains a large but ﬁnite value jmax and remains approxi-
mately constant. Taking into account expression (13) we describe this behavior
of the undamaged tissue by the equation:

∂j
∂t

τ v

+ jΦ(T ) = j0

for

Qt .

r

∈

Here τ v is the delay time of the tissue response and the function Φ(T ) is of the
form

Φ(T ) =

where α = j0/jmax is the ratio of j0 and the maximum jmax of the blood
perfusion rate that can be attained in living tissue due to the vessel expansion
45–46◦C is the
caused by the tissue response to temperature increase, and Tvr
temperature at which the blood vessels exhaust their ability to expand. Inside
the necrosis domain Qn the tissue temperature obeys the heat diﬀusion equation
for solids:

≈

∂T
∂t

= κ

2T + q

∇

where κ is the cellular tissue conductivity and q is the rate of heat generation
due to the laser light absorption. Inside the undamaged tissue the temperature
is governed by the equation taking into account also the eﬀect of the vessel
discreteness (replacement (10)):

Here, as before, jv is the regular component of the blood perfusion rate averaged
over spatial scales of order ℓv, the value δj is its component due to the vessel
discreteness treated as random, and the constants F = κeﬀ/κ > 1 and f < 1 are
of order unity. At the interface Γ between the necrosis domain and the undam-
aged tissue the temperature and the heat ﬂux are assumed to have no jumps,
i.e. the temperature distribution meets the following boundary conditions

Finding the relationship between the averaged and true blood perfusion
rates, jv and j, we have to take into account that the scale ℓv of averaging
in its turn depends on the local value of jv as demonstrated by expression (1).
This dependence enables us to specify functional (3) in the form [16]:

1/√Ln is also a constant of order unity. Equation (37) should be
where λv
subjected to a certain boundary condition at the interface Γ because it makes no
sense to average the blood perfusion rate over the necrosis domain impermeable
to blood. The physical layer separating the necrosis domain and the undamaged
tissue where the local vascular network is not damaged is complex in structure
and contains a spatial increase of the blood perfusion rate from zero to the
value in the undamaged tissue. In order to avoid the problem of analyzing the
blood perfusion rate in this layer we take into account the following simplifying
circumstance. On one hand, the typical size of the necrosis domain formed
during a thermal therapy course and the characteristic length of temperature
variations are of the same order about 1 cm. So, particular details of spatial
variations in the blood perfusion rate on scale much less than 1 cm are not the
factor. On the other hand, the damaged part of the vascular network located
inside the necrosis domain is most probable to be made up of an artery and
vein having supplied previously this region with blood as a whole and of shorter
vessels formed by their branching.
Indeed, the mean volume of living tissue
falling on a single small artery (or vein) of a ﬁxed length l is about l3 [20,
35]. Thus, the regions where the total blood perfusion is directly controlled
by diﬀerent vessel of ﬁxed length do not cross each other substantially and the
architectonics of microcirculatory bed can be approximately represented as the
binary tree embedded uniformly into the cellular tissue [35]. Therefore, the
region containing the vascular network part in which blood ﬂow is remarkably
disturbed because of the necrosis formation does not exceed substantially the
necrosis domain. The latter enables us not to make diﬀerence between the given
layer and the interface Γ and to deal with a sharp jump of the blood perfusion
rate at the necrosis interface. The desired boundary condition imposed on the
averaged blood perfusion rate jv must obey the law of blood conservation, which
in this case can be written as

dr jv(r, t) =

dr j(r, t) .

ZQt

ZQt

So in order to fulﬁll identity (37) we have to set the normal gradient of the
averaged blood perfusion rate equal to zero at the interface Γ:

(38)

(39)

We note that the adopted assumption will not hold if a large vessel goes through
the necrosis domain. However, the probability of this event is small enough and
this case should be analyzed individually.

Here the correlation function g(r, r′) is symmetric with respect to the exchange
of the variables r, r′, i.e. g(r, r′) = g(r′, r) and has to obey the general law of
blood conservation:

The system of equations (29), (30), (32), (33), (37) subject to the boundary
conditions (34)–(36), (39) with expressions (40), (41) makes up the desired free
boundary model.

Keeping in mind that the distributed model was widely used let us, now,
compare the dynamics of the necrosis growth predicted with this model and
with the stated free boundary model under diﬀerent physical conditions. In this
way, ﬁrst, we will verify the basic question as to whether the value ∆ of the
order of 3
Ta) may be regarded as
a suﬃciently small parameter for the free boundary model to hold. Second, we
will actually justify the distributed model because, as will be seen, it does be
independent of the particular details of heat transfer inside the layer of partially
damaged tissue.

3.1 Model comparison

To be deﬁned we simulate the necrosis growth in the tissue phantom shown in
Fig. 5. The applicator presented by the hatched circle locally heats the tissue up
100 ◦C, which causes immediate tissue
to high temperatures of the order Tb
∼
coagulation in the nearest neighborhood of the applicator. This can be the case,
for example, because of the direct heat exchange between the tissue and the
applicator heated to such temperatures or due to irradiation of laser light and
its absorption in an adjacent thin layer (dotted region in Fig. 5). In the latter
case it is typically used additional internal cooling of the applicator boundary,
so the maximum Tb of the temperature attained just near the applicator does
not practically depend on heat diﬀusion into the surrounding tissue. So keeping
in mind the possible vaporization control over the temperature maximum we
will treat the value Tb as a boundary temperature ﬁxed at the interface of a
certain radius r0. Generalizing both these situations let us conﬁne ourselves to
the analysis of local coagulation assuming that:

18

- at the initial time t = 0 the necrosis region under consideration is layer of
37 ◦C

zero thickness whose ﬁnite radius is r0: ζ(r) = 0 and T (r) = Ta
for r > r0;

≈

- the following necrosis growth is governed solely by heat diﬀusion, i.e. we

set q(r, t) = 0 for r > r0;

- at the boundary r = r0 the temperature is a ﬁxed value: T (r0) = Tb

ℜ

→

→ ∞
In other words, we conﬁne ourselves to the region r > r0 where the layer
r0 < r < r0+
(t) represents the necrosis domain whose growth
is directly governed by the heat diﬀusion only. The processes in the region r < r0
remain beyond consideration, i.e. we ignore the real dynamics of initial coagula-
tion in the immediate vicinity of the applicator boundary. The typical duration
of the latter process can be estimated as 1/ω(Tb)
1 sec for the applicator di-
Ta))]
rectly heating the surrounding tissue and as max[1/ω(Tb), q(r0)/(cρ(Tb
for the laser applicator. In the present analysis this duration is regarded as a
small parameter.

Keeping in mind applicators of various forms we study the necrosis growth
in the one-, two-, and three-dimensional tissue phantoms. The tissue response
to temperature variations is described by equation (30) and expression (31) with
α = 0.1 because the tissue response is suﬃciently strong and the blood perfusion
rate can locally increase by tenfold [4]. For the main tissue parameters we use
the values pointed out in Sec. 1.1.1 which give us the following estimates

τ 0 =

10 mm

of the characteristic temporal and spatial scales, τ 0 and ℓ0. We compare the
dynamics of the necrosis growth, namely, the time dependence of the thickness
(t) of the necrosis layer and the coagulation temperature Tcg(t) predicted by
ℜ
the developed free boundary model with that given by the distributed model.
In the latter case we use expression (23) and speciﬁed the required dependence
of the eﬀective thermal conductivity κeﬀ on the fraction ζ of undamaged tissue
by the function

κeﬀ(ζ)/κ = (F

1)ζ + 1 .

Besides, for the distributed mode the necrosis interface Γ is speciﬁed by the
condition ζ
|r∈Γ = 0.5. For the sake of simplicity in the model comparison we
also ignore the eﬀect of vessel discreteness and identify the true and averaged
blood perfusion rates.

First of all, Fig. 6 demonstrates the typical form of the temperature dis-
tribution T (r), the distribution of the undamaged tissue fraction ζ(r), and the
blood perfusion rate j(r) obtained for the one-dimensional tissue phantom in

the frames of the distributed model. As seen in Fig. 6 the region wherein the
undamaged tissue fraction ζ varies substantially in space is suﬃciently thin. So
on spatial scales characterizing the temperature decrease such an increase of the
value ζ(r) may be treated as a sharp jump. The latter actually justiﬁes using
the free boundary model for the given values of the tissue parameters, namely,
the capability for assigning to an eﬀective necrosis boundary a certain coagula-
tion temperature Tcg and certain values (on both the sides) of the temperature
gradient.

Fig. 7 demonstrates the fact that the distributed model leads practically to
the same dynamics of the necrosis growth as that predicted by the free boundary
model for one-, two- , and three-dimensional tissue phantom (ﬁgures (a, b), (c,
d), and (e, f ), respectively). These results have been obtained for the tissue
phantom with the strong (jmax = 10j0) and delayed (τ v = 2 min) response
to temperature variations and so actually comprises the characteristic features
of the necrosis growth in the tissue without response as well as with a strong
immediate response.

The present ﬁgures not only clearly justify that the particular details of ther-
mal coagulation in a real partially damaged layer are not the factor but also
5 ◦C can be treated in fact as
show that the ratio ∆/(Tmax
a small parameter. So the two models may be regarded formally as equivalent,
but the free boundary one does not contain self-inconsistent elements. In addi-
tion the free boundary model can be applied to constructing a faster numerical
algorithm of simulating the necrosis growth because in this model we need not
consider the thin layer of partially damaged tissue. In the free boundary model
we deal with the temperature ﬁeld only in the necrosis region and the region of
undamaged tissue where it is suﬃciently smooth.

In this analysis we have gotten another characteristic feature of local thermal
coagulation illustrated in Fig. 8. The free boundary approximation is rigorously
justiﬁed provided the temperature distribution inside the layer of partially dam-
aged tissue can be regarded as quasistationary. The latter is the case when, in

particular, the time variations δtTcg of the coagulation temperature Tcg are
small enough during the necrosis growth, which in mathematical terms may be
0. Fig. 8 demonstrates that this
stated as the condition δtTcg
condition may be fulﬁlled. Indeed, the smaller is the parameter ∆ of the tissue
damaged rate ω(T, ∆), to a greater extent are smothered the time variations of
the coagulation temperature Tcg except for a short initial period of the necrosis
growth. Besides, the given feature of the local thermal coagulation justiﬁes, at
least at the qualitative level, the a certain simpliﬁcation of the free boundary
model [6, 8] that considers the coagulation temperature Tcg ﬁxed during the
necrosis growth.

3.2 Fixed coagulation temperature approximation

In this approximation expression (35) is replaced by the conditions on the tem-
perature at the necrosis boundary Γ. Namely, it is assumed that inside the
undamaged tissue the temperature cannot exceed the coagulation temperature
Tcg, i.e.

T (r, t) < Tcg

for

r

Qt

∈

(45)

and at the interface Γ the boundary value Ti is either equal to the coagulation
temperature, Ti = Tcg, or rigorously less: Ti < Tcg. The former case takes place
when growing near the interface Γ the temperature comes closely to the value
Tcg and the interface has to move in order to keep up the boundary temperature
Tcg. In the second case the interface is ﬁxed. Both
Ti inside the interval Ti

≤

these conditions can be formally described by the expression:

(Ti

Tcg)(

∂Ti

Γ −

) = 0 ,

(46)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where the boundary temperature Ti(s, t) is treated as a function of the interface
(cid:12)
coordinates s and the time t.

This approximation, except for simplifying the mathematical analysis of local
coagulation, demonstrates the fact that the necrosis growth limited by heat
diﬀusion weakly depends on the particular details of thermal coagulation. All
the characteristics of thermal coagulation are aggregated into the coagulation
temperature Tcg and the coagulation rate ω(T ) is only required to depend on
temperature suﬃciently strong.

→

This fact is illustrated in the following way. We study the necrosis growth
in the one-dimensional tissue phantom within the framework of the distributed
model modiﬁed so to take into account the eﬀect of the blood perfusion nonuni-
formities near the necrosis domain. In other words, in equation (14) we replace
jv, related by equation (37)
the true perfusion rate by the averaged one, j
subject to the boundary condition (39). As before, the eﬀect of vessel discrete-
ness is ignored. We keep track of the points x0.2, x0.5, x0.8 speciﬁed by the
equalities ζ = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, respectively. In this way the dynamics of the necro-
sis growth is characterized by the time dependence of the coordinates x0.2, x0.5
, x0.8 (in mm) and the corresponding temperatures T0.2, T0.5, T0.8 (in degrees
Celsius). Diﬀerent conditions representing various possible limiting cases are
considered. Namely, the tissue phantom without response to temperature vari-
ations, with immediate and delayed response is analyzed. In the ﬁrst case the
blood perfusion rate remains unchanged, j = jv = j0. For tissue with imme-
diate response (τ v = 0) the perfusion rate can attain large values directly at
the beginning of the necrosis growth, whereas for tissue with delayed response
(τ v > 0) this increase will occur only after a lapse of time of order τ v.

2 min) and the temperature T0.5 remains inside the interval 60

Fig. 9 shows the time dependence of the quantities x0.2, x0.5, x0.8, and T0.2,
T0.5, T0.8 for the tissue phantom without thermoregulation (jmax/j0 = 1), with
immediate strong response to temperature variations (jmax/j0 = 5, τ v = 0) and
for the tissue where the delay in the temperature response has a pronounced
eﬀect on thermal coagulation (τ v = 2 min). As seen in Fig. 9(b1–b3) the decrease
of the temperature T0.5 becomes slow suﬃciently quickly (within approximately
70 ◦C
1
during all the time of order of 5
10 min which is a typical duration ttr of
thermal treatment based on thermal coagulation. The width of this interval is
60 ◦C. So
sixth as less as the typical value of the tissue overheating, Tb
at ﬁrst approximation, the temperature T0.5 may be treated as a ﬁxed constant
Tcg. Besides, whence it follows that the coagulation temperature Tcg being a
phenomenological parameter of this approximation can be estimated from the
expression

Indeed, under such conditions thermal coagulation proceeds practically at the
temperature Tcg and the value of 1/ω(Tcg) is approximately the time it takes
for the live tissue located before in the necrosis region to be damaged. Because
of a strong temperature dependence of ω(T ) this estimate gives us the value of
Tcg to suﬃcient accuracy. In addition, to make the comparison of the two model
more clear we have used in the simulation the value Tcg = 60 ◦C found from
expression (47) (for ttr
5 min) rather than the value of Tcg approximating the
dependence T0.5(t) to the best degree.

∼

ℜ

Another characteristics of thermal coagulation is illustrated in Fig. 9(a1–a3).
Comparing the time dependence x0.5(t) with the curves “FBM” (describing the
motion
(t) of the necrosis interface in the free boundary model with the ﬁxed
coagulation temperature) we see that there are two stages of the necrosis growth.
The former corresponds to the time interval (0, tcg), where tcg
∼
4 min. At this stage the necrosis domain grows fast enough and in the free
boundary model the interface Γ reaches its limit position
lim. This saturation
of the interface displacement is due to the temperature distribution becoming
stationary. At the latter stage (from tcg to ttr) the necrosis domain grows
slowly and in the free boundary model it is ﬁxed. In other words, the proposed
model makes the diﬀerence of these stages more pronounced. If the treatment
is continued, the real necrosis domain will grow further and after a lapse of
20
30 minutes the necrosis domain will deviate signiﬁcantly in form from that
predicted by the given model. However such a prolonged treatment is typically
used to produce a hyperthermia eﬀect (without visible injury) rather than to
cause thermal coagulation directly [33].

It should be noted that the existence of the two stages does not obviously re-
sult from the dependence T0.5(t) because in fact the necrosis continues to grow
slow at the second stage too. However, as follows from the present analysis,
these stages diﬀer from each other not only in the necrosis growth rate but also
according to the behavior of the temperature distribution. The slow stage is
characterized by the quasistationary temperature distribution. In other words,
at this stage time scales on which the size
of the necrosis domain increases
substantially are much larger than time scales on which temperature distribu-
tion becomes steady-state provided the necrosis boundary is ﬁxed. The given
property is caused by the exponential dependence of the damaged tissue rate
ω(T ) on the temperature. At the fast stage these scales are of the same order.
Concluding this subsection we note that the ﬁxed boundary temperature ap-
proximation predicts the dynamics of thermal coagulation to a suﬃciently good
accuracy. Indeed, the motion of the partially damaged tissue layer is practically
represented in Fig. 9(a1–a3) by the region bounded by the curves x0.2(t) and
x0.8(t). So the free boundary model can be regarded as adequate, if the dif-
ference
remarkably.
As seen in Fig. 9(a1–a3) this is the case except for the beginning of the growth
and times larger than 10 min, where we have gone beyond the ﬁxed coagulation
temperature approximation.

4 Characteristics of the necrosis growth

The stated above model describes several diﬀerent features of living tissue aﬀect-
ing simultaneously the necrosis growth limited by heat diﬀusion. So to penetrate
deeper in its properties it is reasonable to analyze them individually, which is
the subject of the present section.

4.1 Eﬀect of the vessel discreteness

To clarify the essence of this eﬀect let us conﬁne our consideration to its qual-
itative analysis referring interested readers to speciﬁc papers [10, 12, 13] for a
detailed analysis.

The vessel discreteness manifesting itself in the random component δj(r, t) of
the blood perfusion rate causes random perturbation δT (r, t) in the temperature
ﬁeld. Actually δj is the diﬀerence between the true perfusion rate and one
averaged over scales about ℓv. So the latter is also the correlation length of ﬁeld
δj(r, t) (Sec. 1.1.1). In this subsection we mainly consider the formation of the
ℓv√Ln, which enables us, at least formally,
ℓT
necrosis domain of size
assume the inequality
ℓv to hold. The exception is the formation of a
three-dimensional necrosis domain whose growth is due to a small applicator
or the laser light absorption inside a small region [9] and it will be discussed
below. Therefore in the case under consideration the mean amplitude σ and the
correlation length λ of the temperature random nonuniformities δT (r, t) should
be approximately the same as for such nonuniformities under uniform heating
ℓv. The ﬁeld δT (r, t) in its
and be given by formula (9) and the estimate λ
turn aﬀects the form of the necrosis interface Γ making it randomly perturbed
as shown in Fig. 10.
It is obviously, that the correlation length ℓΓ of these
interface perturbations is also about ℓv, i.e.

The remaining characteristic of the interface perturbations that should be found
is their amplitude or, what is the same, the thickness δΓ of the layer bounding
these perturbations (Fig. 10).

In the ﬁxed coagulation temperature approximation (Sec. 3.2) the form of the
necrosis domain perturbed by the random temperature nonuniformities δT (r, t)
due to the vessel discreteness is speciﬁed by the condition:

[Tv(r, t) + δT (r, t)]
r∈Γ = Tcg ,
|

where Tv(r, t) is the regular component of the temperature ﬁeld (i.e. the solution
of equations (32), (33) for δj = 0). In a neighborhood of the necrosis boundary
Γ whose thickness is much less than the mean necrosis radius
the spatial
variations of the averaged temperature Tv(r, t) can be approximated by a linear
dependence on the spatial coordinates r:

Expressions (48) and (51) substantiate, at least formally, the validity of the
following scale hierarchy: δΓ < ℓΓ <
. So, when describing the growth of a
ℜ
necrosis domain as a whole one can ignore the eﬀect of the vessel discreteness
and identify the averaged tissue temperature Tv(r, t) and the true one T (r, t)
[13]. However when the attention is focused on the particular form of a necro-
sis domain, i.e. spatial scales smaller than the mean necrosis size are under
consideration such necrosis perturbations are substantial.

To justify the latter statement and to measure the eﬀect of these perturba-
tions on the necrosis form we compare the value δΓ with the thickness δζ of the
layer of partially damaged tissue where thermal coagulation is under way. As
results from (20) and (51) for typical values of the tissue parameters we get

δΓ

Therefore, these random perturbations of the necrosis interface exceed suﬃ-
ciently its physical thickness, i.e. the thickness of the layer of partially damaged
tissue. In other words, because of the temperature nonuniformities due to the
vessel discreteness the necrosis form should be disturbed substantially, deviating

27

remarkably from that predicted by the distributed model dealing solely with the
averaged tissue temperature Tv(r, t).

However when, for example, the characteristic size of the applicator is suﬃ-
ciently small (about a few millimeters) the temperature ﬁeld becomes substan-
tially nonuniform not only due to heat dissipation caused by blood perfusion but
also because of the geometric factor caused by the heat propagation from the
applicator into the surrounding tissue. In three-dimensional space the temper-
ature ﬁeld T (r) induced by a small localized source even inside a tissue without
perfusion will decrease as 1/r. Under such conditions it is this spatial decrease
in temperature that mainly controls the necrosis growth rather than heat diﬀu-
sion into the surrounding live tissue. So the thickness
of the necrosis domain
is less then ℓT , namely, can be about ℓv[9] and the perturbations of its boundary
due to the vessel discreteness are depressed considerably [12].

ℜ

Expressions (48) and (51) are actually the main results of the present sub-
section. In the following subsections we will focus out attention on the growth
of a necrosis domain as a whole and, thus, will ignore the vessel discreteness
eﬀect.

4.2 Eﬀects of the tissue response to heating

In this section we analyze how the tissue response to local strong heating aﬀects
the necrosis growth. To single out these eﬀects in their own right and to simplify
the analysis we conﬁne ourselves to studying the necrosis growth in the one-
dimensional tissue phantom described in Sec. 3.1 (Fig. 5) and adopt the ﬁxed
coagulation temperature approximation.

First, we consider the tissue with immediate response, corresponding to
τ v = 0 in equation (30). In this case the thickness
lim of the necrosis domain
attained during the fast stage of the coagulation is determined by the stationary
temperature distribution. In particular, for the tissue phantom without thermal
regulation (α = 1) the blood perfusion rate is constant, j = j0, and as follows
from equations (32) and (33):

is the fast stage of the necrosis growth. The duration of the fast stage is ac-
tually the characteristic time tcg during which the size of the necrosis domain
attains values about
lim. Comparing the numerical values of the corresponding

expression

which conforms to the general properties of heat transfer in living tissue. Indeed,
in the given model, as follows from equations (32) and (33), the time it takes
for the temperature distribution to become steady-state is about f jmax and
the establishment of this steady-state (in reality, quasistationary) temperature
distribution is actually the essence of the fast stage.

Fig. 11b shows the temperature distribution for the tissue without thermoreg-
ulation (curve 1) and for the tissue with strong immediate response (curve 2,
jmax/j0 = 10). In order to compare them with each other, lengths are measured
in units of the corresponding necrosis size. Whence it follows that, in contract
to the time dependence
(t), the tissue response to heating practically does not
aﬀect the form of temperature distribution.

ℜ

≪

When the tissue response to temperature variations is suﬃciently strong
(α
1) the blood perfusion rate j becomes substantially nonuniform. In this
case the averaged perfusion rate jv diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the true one j,
which has a certain eﬀect on the growth of small necroses. The latter feature is
illustrated in Fig. 12

Fig. 12a compares the dynamics of the necrosis growth described by the
given model and by the same model where, however, equation (37) is omitted
and the replacement jv
j is made. Fig. 12b shows the distribution of the
tissue temperature T , the true blood perfusion rate j, and the averaged one jv
that occur when the tissue responds in such an intensive way. In this case, as
seen in Fig. 12b, the averaged blood perfusion rate can be twice as less as the
true one. The latter has a certain eﬀect on the necrosis growth because ignoring
the diﬀerence between jv and j gives a more lower estimate of the necrosis size

Now we consider how the delay in the tissue response can aﬀect thermal
coagulation. This eﬀect is remarkable when the delay time τ v is comparable
with the duration of the fast stage tcg. So we may conﬁne ourselves to values
tcg. The diﬀerence in dynamics of the necrosis domain growth for the
τ v
tissues responding immediately (τ v = 0) and with a certain delay (τ v
2 min)
is illustrated in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.

As seen in Fig. 13a when the tissue response is delayed essentially the necro-
sis domain, ﬁrstly, grows fast enough keeping ahead of one growing in the tissue
with the immediate response. Then the growth of the necrosis domain is sup-
pressed and further its form remains unchanged. It should be noted that in this
case the saturation of the necrosis domain growth is not due to the tempera-
ture distribution becoming stationary. Its reason is the increase of the blood
perfusion rate after a lapse of a time about τ . Under such conditions there

is enough time for the size

of the necrosis domain to attain values of order
1/j0 until the blood perfusion rate increases substantially. These
ℜ
values could not be attained if the tissue response were not delayed. So after
the blood perfusion rate increases, the following growth of the necrosis domain
becomes impossible and the temperature Ti at the interface Γ must go below
Tcg and the necrosis domain has to cease to grow. This behavior of the interface
temperature is illustrated in Fig. 14. It should be noted that such a saturation
of the necrosis growth for real tissues seems to be more pronounced because a
real necrosis continues to grow at the slow stage until the blood perfusion rate
becomes high enough.

Fig. 13b shows the distribution of the temperature and blood perfusion rate
at diﬀerent time moments for the tissue with delayed response. As before, the
length is measured in the corresponding values of the necrosis size in order
to compare these distributions. As time elapses the perfusion rate increases
due to the tissue response. In contrast to this behavior of the perfusion rate,
the form of the temperature distribution practically remains unchanged. The
comparison of the given result and one obtained for the tissue responding to
temperature variations immediately (Fig. 11b) leads us to the conclusion that
the form of the temperature distribution occurring in tissue during the necrosis
growth depends weakly on the speciﬁc values of the tissue parameters. This
conclusion, in particular, forms the basis for applying variational techniques to
analysis of the thermal coagulation due to laser-tissue interaction.

It should be noted that the conclusion concerning the universal form of the
temperature distribution has been made analyzing the necrosis growth in the
tissue phantoms that diﬀer only in the properties of thermoregulation. The
other tissue parameters (for example, the tissue thermal conductivity κ and the
initial value j0 of the blood perfusion rate) take on particular values ﬁxed in the
present analysis. This raises the question of whether the stated conclusion will

of time and length aggregating such parameters we can rewrite the governing
equations in the dimensionless form. Thus their particular values are not the
factor.

4.3 Eﬀect of the applicator geometry

In the previous section we have actually studied the characteristics of the necro-
sis growth when the applicator is suﬃciently large and the necrosis domain can
be locally treated as a plane layer. If the applicator is small enough so its size
is about or even less than the thickness of the necrosis layer the heat diﬀusion
into the surrounding tissue gives rise to the temperature distribution depending
on the applicator form. The latter in turn aﬀects the necrosis formation. This
eﬀect is the subject of the present section reviewing the results obtained in [9].
As in the previous section we study the necrosis growth in the tissue phantom
described in Sec. 3.1 (Fig. 5) but applying the free boundary model in its general
form (Sec. 3), i.e. assuming the necrosis boundary motion to be governed by
expression (35) because under such conditions time variations in the coagulation
temperature become remarkable. However, keeping in mind that the latter fact
is the main reason of the eﬀects under consideration we will make no diﬀerence
between the true and averaged perfusion rates in order to simplify the analysis.
Characteristic features of the necrosis growth depending actually on the ap-
plicator form are demonstrated in Fig. 15–Fig. 17. Namely, Fig. 15a shows
(t) changes for the
how the time dependence of the necrosis layer thickness
applicator of plane (d = 1), cylindrical (d = 2), and spherical (d = 3) form for
the tissue phantom with the same properties. Here is illustrated the dynamics
of the necrosis growth in the tissue phantom without response to temperature
variations for r0 = 5 mm. Fig. 15a shows that for one-dimensional tissue phan-
tom the diﬀerence between the fast and the slow stages is not well distinctive
and the necrosis growth is under way practically throughout the whole course
of a typical thermotherapy procedure. For the three-dimensional tissue phan-

tom we meet the opposite situation. In this case the necrosis growth exhibits
the clearly evident tendency to saturation after a lapse of several minutes and
after 12 minutes the thickness
ℜ|d=3 of the necrosis layer can attain the value
only somewhat less than the initial radius r0 of the necrosis domain. At the
same time in the one-dimensional tissue phantom the necrosis radius exceeds
this value by several times. In the two-dimensional tissue phantom the necro-
sis growth is characterized by the intermediate behavior. It should be noted
that in contrast to this the time dependence of the interface temperature Ti(t)
(Fig. 15b) is practically of the same form for the three cases.

These results prompt us that the rate of the necrosis growth in the three-

layer would attain for an applicator of plane geometry. This fact is directly
demonstrated in Fig. 16 showing the dynamics of the necrosis growth in the
tissue phantom without response to temperature variations (ﬁgure a) as well as
with an immediate strong response (ﬁgure b). At a ﬁxed moment of time the
necrosis layers can diﬀer in thickness by a factor of three to four as the initial
radius r0 changes from 2 mm to 18 mm. As should be expected for the two-
dimensional tissue phantom this dependence is smoothed (Fig. 16) and under
the same conditions the necrosis thickness can increase not more than two-fold.

ℜ|d=1 it is the initial radius of the necrosis domain that di-
words, until r0 <
rectly controls the size of the necrosis layer which can be attained during a
typical course of thermotherapy. This property of the necrosis growth is due
to the fact that in the three-dimensional space the temperature ﬁeld governed
by heat diﬀusion from a local source would remain substantially nonuniform
(T (r)
) even though we ignored the heat sink eﬀect caused by
blood perfusion. So in the three-dimensional tissue phantom the temperature at
the necrosis interface Tcg inevitably has to decrease substantially as the necrosis
layer grows. So due to the strong temperature dependence of the coagulation
rate ω(Tcg) the necrosis growth will be practically suppressed after a lapse of
time it takes for the
ℜ|d=1 (t) to exceed the initial necrosis radius r0. Whence
it follows that for real applicators of the spherical form whose size does not
exceed several millimeters the thickness of the necrosis layer will be directly
controlled by its size and, may be, by the depth of laser light penetration into
the tissue because in this case heat diﬀusion standing along leads to the sat-
uration in the necrosis growth. In the two-dimensional space (and more so in
the one-dimensional space) heat diﬀusion tends to make the temperature ﬁeld
uniform. Thus, for the two-dimensional tissue phantom the dependence of the
necrosis growth on the initial radius should be smoothed and the thickness of
the necrosis layer will be ﬁnite even though we formally set r0 = 0 (Fig. 17). In
particular, for the case shown in Fig. 17 the change of the initial radius from

Figure 18: The universality of the time dependence of the coagulation (inter-
face) temperature Ti(t). All the curves Ti(t) obtained under various conditions
belong to the dotted region. The upper boundary of this region corresponds to
the one-dimensional tissue phantom without temperature response, the lower
one corresponds to the tree-dimensional tissue tissue phantom with a strong
immediate response (jmax = 10j0).

zero to inﬁnity causes the necrosis layer in the two-dimensional tissue phantom
to increase in thickness by 2–3-fold.

The dynamics of the necrosis growth depends substantially on the physical
conditions. However, it turns out that the time dependence of the coagulation
temperature Tcg(t) (i.e. the temperature at the necrosis interface) is practically
insensitive to particular details of the growth conditions. This fact is demon-
strated in Fig. 18. We have discovered that all the curves Tcg(t) obtained numer-
ically for various growth conditions are located inside the dotted region which is
thin enough. This property of the necrosis growth is relative to the universality
of the one-dimensional temperature distribution demonstrated in Sec. 4.2 and
justify the conclusion that the general form of the temperature ﬁeld can depend
slowly on particular values of the main tissue parameters. Such a fact shows the
feasibility of applying variational methods to analysis of the necrosis growth in
more complicated cases and is undoubtedly worth special consideration.

4.4 Self-localization of the necrosis growth in tissue with

a tumor due to thermoregulation

In section 4.2 we have demonstrated that the tissue response to heating aﬀects
substantially the necrosis growth limited by heat diﬀusion.
It is due to the
caused increase in the blood perfusion rate strengthening the heat dissipation in
the surrounding undamaged tissue, which suppresses the further heat diﬀusion
into it and, as the result, the necrosis growth. According to the experimental
data [4] only the normal tissue can exhibit a signiﬁcant increase in the blood
perfusion rate in the response to the temperature growth. whereas inside a

tumor an increase in the blood perfusion rate is depressed. This leads to some
self-localization of the temperature inside tumor and self-localization of necrosis
growth due to thermoregulation. The latter feature is illustrated in Fig. 19, 20
where results of mathematical modeling of the two and three dimensional cases
are presented.

5 Laser induced heat diﬀusion limited tissue co-

agulation as a speciﬁc therapy mode

One of the main parameters controlling a thermotherapy treatment is the power
of irradiation delivered into the tissue and the treatment duration. These pa-
rameters as well as a speciﬁc therapy mode should be chosen in such a way that
gives rise to the necrosis of desired form. Diﬀerent modes, in principle, can give
rise to a necrosis region of the same form and, in this case, a speciﬁc mode may
be chosen keeping in mind, for example, its optimality and stability. Various
thermotherapy modes are singled out by those physical mechanisms that play
the leading role and endow them with individual properties [33]. The presented
results enable us to regard the laser induced heat diﬀusion limited tissue coag-

ulation as an individual therapy mode where heat diﬀusion into the live tissue,
i.e. the tissue with active blood perfusion, plays the governing role.

To justify the latter statement let us brieﬂy summarize the aforesaid. Namely,
we have considered thermal tissue coagulation induced by local heating due to
laser light absorption and limited by heat diﬀusion into the surrounding live
tissue. The irradiation power is assumed to be enough high for the tempera-
ture inside the region aﬀected directly by laser light to grow up to values about
100 ◦C. Then this process is characterized by the following.

(I) In the considered case the necrosis growth is governed by the tissue
thermal coagulation inside a layer of thickness about 1 mm that separates the
necrosis domain and the live tissue and involves the partially damaged tissue.
This layer is thin enough so the standard bioheat equation cannot be applied to
describing temperature distribution in it because on such scales this equation
does not hold. Therefore, the approach used previously by other authors (see,
e.g., [31, 32] and references therein) which is based on the continuous description
of heat transfer and thermal coagulation inside the layer of partially damaged
tissue (the distributed model) is inconsistent.

(II) This inconsistency is overcome in the free boundary model of local ther-
mal coagulation which regards the layer of partially damaged tissue as an in-
ﬁnitely thin interface of the necrosis domain whose motion is governed by the
boundaries values of tissue temperature and its gradient. In addition, the free
boundary model takes into account the perturbations of the tissue temperature
caused by the vessel discreteness.

(III) The necrosis growth caused by heat diﬀusion limited thermal coagula-
tion depends weakly on the particular details of heat transfer inside the layer
of partially damaged tissue. This property justiﬁes the distributed model. Nev-
ertheless, we think that using the free boundary model is favored because in
addition to being consistent it singles out the characteristic features governing
the necrosis growth.

In particular, basing on the free boundary model we have found that:

ℜ

(IV) Heat diﬀusion limited thermal coagulation involves two stages, fast and
slow. It is the former stage during which the necrosis domain is mainly formed
can be estimated by expression (54). Expression (55) estimates
and its size
the duration tcg of this stage. The latter stage is characterized by a substan-
tially slower growth of the necrosis domain, with this slowdown becoming more
pronounced as the applicator dimensions decrease. For the applicators of the
spherical form whose radius does not exceed several millimeters the character-
istic size of a necrosis domain formed during a typical course of thermotherapy
is directly determined by the applicator radius and, may be, by the depth of
laser light penetration into the tissue. Under such conditions even heat diﬀusion
itself gives rise to the practical saturation in the necrosis growth and the fast
and slow stages are most distinctive.

(V) The blood perfusion rate can become extremely nonuniform in the vicin-
ity of the necrosis domain because of the strong tissue response to temperature

38

variations. In this case in modelling thermal coagulation one should take into
account that the temperature distribution is governed by the averaged blood
perfusion rate rather than the true one. The delay in the tissue response on
time scales of order tcg can aﬀect thermal coagulation essentially. In this case,
in particular, the duration of the fast stage is controlled by the delay time τ v.
attained by the necrosis domain under such conditions is determined
The size
by the initial value of the blood perfusion rate j0 rather than those (jmax
j0)
occurring near the necrosis domain at the second stage due to the temperature
tissue response.

≫

ℜ

(VI) The discreteness of the vessel arrangement causes perturbations in the
tissue temperature, which is described by introducing additional nonuniformities
of the blood perfusion rate regarded as random. These temperature nonunifor-
mities it turn give rise to perturbations in the necrosis boundary whose ampli-
tude δΓ and the correlation length ℓΓ are estimated as:

δΓ

ℓΓ

∼

√Ln ℜ

.

≈

≈

4 (l/a

ln(l/a)

Here the factor Ln
40 is the characteristic ratio of the indi-
∼
vidual length to radius of blood vessels forming peripheral circulation systems).
It should be noted that, ﬁrst, these boundary perturbations are remarkable be-
cause they exceed in amplitude the thickness δζ of the layer of partially damaged
tissue where thermal coagulation is under way. Second, the universal form of
these relations is due to the vascular network being fractal in structure. How-
ever, for spherical applicators of small size (about several millimeters) the eﬀect
of the vessel discreteness is depressed because in this case blood perfusion does
not aﬀect the necrosis growth substantially.

Concerning certain additional aspects in the theoretical description of heat

diﬀusion limited thermal coagulation we can state the following:

(VII) The free boundary model can be the basis of a faster numerical algo-
rithm of simulating the necrosis growth because it deals with solely the necrosis
region and the undamaged tissue where the temperature distribution T (r, t) is
a smooth ﬁeld.

(VIII) The time dependence of the temperature in the layer where thermal
coagulation is under way (the coagulation temperature) is practically insensitive
to the particular details of the growth conditions and to the particular values
of the tissue parameters. For applicators of large dimensions (exceeding 1 cm)
the form of the temperature distribution occurring in tissue during the necrosis
growth also depends weakly on the particular values of the tissue parameters.
The given properties form the basis for applying diﬀerent variational techniques
to analyzing heat diﬀusion limited thermal coagulation.

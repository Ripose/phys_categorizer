Abstract. An image restoration approach based on a Bayesian maximum entropy
method (MEM) has been applied to a radiological image deconvolution problem, that
of reduction of geometric blurring in magniﬁcation mammography. The aim of the
work is to demonstrate an improvement in image spatial resolution in realistic noisy
radiological images with no associated penalty in terms of reduction in the signal-
to-noise ratio perceived by the observer.
Images of the TORMAM mammographic
image quality phantom were recorded using the standard magniﬁcation settings
of 1.8 magniﬁcation/ﬁne focus and also at 1.8 magniﬁcation/broad focus and 3.0
magniﬁcation/ﬁne focus; the latter two arrangements would normally give rise to
unacceptable geometric blurring. Measured point-spread functions were used in
conjunction with the MEM image processing to de-blur these images. The results
are presented as comparative images of phantom test features and as observer scores
for the raw and processed images. Visualization of high resolution features and the
total image scores for the test phantom were improved by the application of the MEM
It is argued that this successful demonstration of image de-blurring in
processing.
noisy radiological images oﬀers the possibility of weakening the link between focal spot
size and geometric blurring in radiology, thus opening up new approaches to system
optimization.

1. Introduction

The design of radiological
imaging equipment has developed to reﬂect the best
compromise between a number of contradictory performance requirements. In particular
the design of x-ray tubes has evolved to best ﬁt the requirements for the smallest possible
focal spot size combined with the maximum target heat capacity.
In this case the
performance compromise is between geometrical blurring introduced by a ﬁnite focal
spot size and movement blurring introduced by the long radiographic exposure time
required to operate a very small focal spot within its heat loading limits. The most

common resulting design, rotating target with an acute target angle, represents an
impressive engineering solution to this problem.

An alternative potential solution to the problem of geometrical blurring, applicable
to modern digital receptors, is digital image processing. Provided the characteristics
of the image blurring function are known, an image can, in theory, be restored to
in
that which would have been produced by a perfect point focal spot. However,
practice the degree to which radiological images can be restored to remove geometric
blurring, using conventional Fourier deconvolution strategies, is severely limited by noise.
The relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio of radiological images is a direct result of the
requirement to operate within the ALARP principle, so that patient radiation doses are
‘kept as low as reasonably practicable consistent with the intended purpose’ (IRMER
2000). Radiological images are therefore expected to be inherently noisy, with quantum
noise being the dominant noise source. The noise power extends to the highest spatial
frequencies recorded by the receptor, and it is the modulation at these higher spatial
frequencies which is ampliﬁed using Fourier-based techniques, resulting in an image
dominated by high frequency noise. The Wiener ﬁlter (Wiener 1949; Helstrom 1967)
is a popular deconvolution tool which attempts to address the shortcomings of direct
Fourier inversion techniques.
Its application to non-mammographic images has been
demonstrated by Dougherty and Kawaf (2001). However, it is our experience that these
techniques are of marginal value in radiology.

In this work, an alternative image restoration approach based on a Bayesian
maximum entropy method is applied to a radiological image deconvolution problem:
reduction of geometric blurring in mammography. The aim of the work is to demonstrate
an improvement in image spatial resolution with no associated penalty in terms of
reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer. The images used here
were digitized ab initio; in principle digitized ﬁlm could be used, but this would almost
certainly be an unacceptable inconvenience if digital processing of this nature were
to become part of clinical practice. Indeed it is the advent of Computed and Direct
Radiography which we believe make this work particularly timely.

2. Medical image restoration

There is a large body of literature describing methods which aim to improve the quality
of image information content through restoration techniques. Medical images are usually
measurements of photon ﬂux, and the data is usually noisy and often incomplete;
statistical methods have yielded some robust methods of estimating the ‘true’ image
distribution in these circumstances. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
(Dempster et al 1977) has been widely applied to ﬁnding solutions which maximize a
likelihood function for quantum noise limited data; in the medical context this method
has been used by Hudson and Larkin (1994), De Pierro (1995) and Kinahan et al (1997)
for tomographic imaging. In the astronomical community EM is known as Richardson-
Lucy deconvolution (Richardson 1972; Lucy 1974; Shepp and Vardi 1982). Snyder et al

Mammographic image restoration using maximum entropy deconvolution

(1992) describe a method which maximizes the mean value of the log-likelihood for
quantum noise limited data. It has been shown that this is equivalent to minimizing
Csisz`ar’s I-divergence (Csisz`ar 1991), a quantity equal to the negative of the entropy
expression, −S, given in equation (7). The usefulness of Bayesian restoration stems
from the fact that it allows the incorporation of sophisticated a priori knowledge into
the formulation of the restoration method, while quite naturally enforcing desirable
properties such as positivity in the restoration. It has been argued by Skilling (1989)
that in the absence of further prior information entropy is the only consistent prior for
positive, additive images. O’Sullivan et al (1998) gives a summary of these methods in
terms of information theoretic image formation models.

2.1. MEM theory

The links between statistical mechanics and information theory were established by
Jaynes (1957a,b, 1968). Image restoration using MEM was ﬁrst described in a landmark
paper by Frieden (1972). The driving force behind practical implementations of the
method came from radio astronomy and the need to improve radio maps of the sky
(Gull and Daniell 1978; Cornwell and Evans 1985).

MEM is a deconvolution technique derived from the forward map (1) for the imaging

system, which relates postulated hidden data xij to the observed data dij.

dij = xij ∗ h + nij

(1)

Equation (1) is the forward map for the imaging system. The PSF, denoted by h,
characterizes the geometric blurring of the imaging system, which acts on the hidden
data. The hidden image is then further corrupted by additive noise to produce the
observed image dij.

The goal of image restoration is to obtain a solution ˆx , which approximates to the
hidden image x, as closely as the data and noise allow. We outline brieﬂy the MEM
approach to the problem here, but for a more complete review see Jaynes (1982) and
Skilling and Gull (1985). The notation in the following analysis has been simpliﬁed in
relation to equation (1), in that the data etc. are represented as vectors rather than 2D
arrays.

A trial restoration ˆx is obtained and used as an initial guess for the hidden image
x. The trial restoration is blurred, via equation (1), to generate mock data ˆd. The χ2

Mammographic image restoration using maximum entropy deconvolution

goodness of ﬁt statistic is used to measure the degree of misﬁt between the observed
data and mock data:

χ2 = Pi(di − ˆdi)2

σ2

ˆx = A

−1d

where σ2 is the variance in the noise, here taken to be constant. It might be thought
that a good approach would be to minimize this degree of misﬁt by choosing a suitable
ˆx, but this process is equivalent to the straightforward matrix inversion:

where A is the matrix representation of the linear forward map equation (1). The
problem here is that typically the matrix A is ill-conditioned, i.e. almost singular, so
for a given d there are many vectors ˆx which almost satisfy equation (3), not necessarily
close together. Thus if d contains even a small amount of noise, the resulting ˆx can
be far from the true image x; in other words the reconstruction is then dominated by
noise rather than data, often referred to as over-restoration. In the presence of noise
we would not in any case expect χ2 to be minimized, but rather to be reduced to the
appropriate value χ2 = N, where N is the number of pixels in the image. Even when A
is not ill-conditioned there are many ˆx which satisfy this criterion. MEM is an example
of regularized deconvolution and relies on a scheme of iterated forward maps rather than
attempting to ﬁnd a direct solution of the inverse problem.

MEM treats the restoration process as a statistical inference problem based on

Bayes’ theorem and the aim is to obtain the most probable image ˆx given the data:

P (ˆx | d) ∝ P (d | ˆx) × P (ˆx)

The likelihood P (d | ˆx) is determined from our knowledge of the forward map equation
(1); the image noise is mainly quantum (photon) noise, which is modelled as a Gaussian
process, so the likelihood term is quantiﬁed by the χ2 distribution:

P (d | ˆx) ∝ exp(−χ2/2)

The prior P (ˆx) is the probability that would be assigned by to a particular reconstruction
ˆx prior to the introduction of observational constraints.
It is assumed that each
luminance quantum has an equal a priori chance of falling into any pixel, in which
case it is easy to show that

where S is the conﬁgurational entropy of the hidden image. For positive additive
distributions the entropy is deﬁned as (Skilling 1988):

P (ˆx) ∝ exp(S)

S(ˆx) = X
i

[ ˆxi − m − ˆxi ln( ˆxi/m)]

Here m is a (constant) default level; S is maximized when ˆxi = m, giving a ﬂat featureless
If each luminance quantum has a diﬀerent chance of falling into any

pixel, the default levels mi for pixel i can be chosen accordingly, and S is maximized
when ˆxi = mi. A non-ﬂat default level would be appropriate for example when the
X-ray illumination is not uniform or when other knowledge of the restoration is known
a priori. The strict deﬁnition of posterior probability is therefore:

P (ˆx | d) ∝ exp(S − χ2/2)

Values of ˆxi which maximize this probability should be determined. This cannot

pragmatic modiﬁcation of equation (8) is used:

P (ˆx | d) ∝ exp(αS − χ2) = exp(Q)

where Q = αS − χ2, and α is a multiplier, as yet undetermined. χ2 is a measure of the
misﬁt between the actual observations and those corresponding to the trial values ˆxi;
S is a measure of the structure within the trial image. If α is too small then too much
weight will be given to the data, thus amplifying the eﬀects of noise; if α is too large
then too much weight will be given to the entropy and each ˆxi will be dragged towards
its default value mi, thus losing real features. The procedure is to maximize Q with
α initially ﬁxed; a particular value of χ2 will correspond to this maximum. The aim
is that this value should coincide with the expectation χ2 = N; the value of α which
achieves this aim is found by a process of iteration.

in which α is ﬁxed,

Initial feasibility tests were undertaken using the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox
(The Mathworks Ltd, Cambridge, UK), particularly the constrained nonlinear
minimization function fmincon in its LargeScale conﬁguration, with a positivity
constraint on each ˆxi. This function employs a preconditioned conjugate gradient
method (Coleman and Li 1994, 1996). Our procedure has two loops. The inner
iterates towards the minimum value of −Q for that α,
one,
and generates a corresponding value χ2(α). The second loop iterates over α to
minimize χ2(α) − N, and is terminated when χ2(α) falls within the narrow statistical
range N ± (2N)1/2 (Jackson and Ward 1981). Typically each loop requires 20 to
30 iterations, and the ﬁnal value of α is of order 20. After our successful
initial
implementation commercially available C++ software was purchased (MEMSYS5,
Maximum Entropy Data Consultants, Bury St Edmunds, UK). This employs essentially
the same scheme, but is highly optimized, as described in Skilling and Bryan (1984) and
Gull and Skilling (1999). The MEMSYS5 software can handle larger images than our
initial implementation, with much shorter processing times.

3. Experimental Method

Image quality comparisons were carried out using the Leeds TORMAM test object
(ﬁgure 1) at various settings of geometric magniﬁcation. This phantom contains three
groups of test features; ﬁbres, simulated microcalciﬁcation clusters and low contrast
plastic disks, plus an area designed to give an anthropomorphic impression of a breast

parenchymal pattern with overlying microcalciﬁcation clusters (Cowen et al 1992). This
latter area of the phantom was not used in the present work. The phantom was imaged
in various conﬁgurations on a laboratory-based Siemens Mammomat 3 mammography
unit, with measured focal spot sizes of 0.7×0.3mm broad focus and 0.2×0.2mm ﬁne
focus. In all cases the phantom was imaged on top of a 3.5cm thick stack of Perspex
to provide realistic scatter and attenuation as recommended in the instructions for the
phantom. The radiographic factors used were 28kVp, 40mAs. These factors were chosen
to be representative of the values used in routine mammographic quality assurance tests.
The level of quantum noise in the test images was therefore realistic. The digital image
receptor was part of a Philips ACR-3 Computed Radiography system (100 µm pixel
size), comprising 1770 × 2370 pixels with overall dimensions 18 × 24 cm.

In order to provide a sample of the point spread function (PSF) in the plane of
the phantom, a piece of brass foil with a pinhole was included in the test images. In
any practical application of this technique, the PSF information would be obtained from
calibration images appropriately scaled for the position of the object. Including the PSF
with the image was convenient in this demonstration as the scaling and interpolation
step was avoided. The measured overall PSF is a convolution of one due to geometry
and the the detector PSF, but is nevertheless the appropriate one to use. In fact the
contribution from the detector PSF was small, evidenced by the fact that the measured
PSF scaled with focal spot size and magniﬁcation in the appropriate manner (see ﬁgure
2).

Three imaging geometries were used to illustrate varying degrees of focal spot

geometrical blurring:

Mammographic image restoration using maximum entropy deconvolution

Magniﬁcation 1.8, broad focus (1.8BF). The plane of the phantom was 33.5cm
from the tube focus and 27cm from the plane of the receptor. The image would be
expected to be unacceptably degraded by geometric blurring.

Magniﬁcation 1.8, ﬁne focus (1.8FF). The phantom was in the same position as
above, but imaged using the ﬁne focal spot. This is the conventional magniﬁcation
view provided on this mammography unit and used clinically.

Magniﬁcation 3.0, ﬁne focus (3.0FF). The plane of the phantom was 20.5cm from
tube focus and 40cm from the plane of the receptor. This high magniﬁcation factor
is not supported on standard mammography units because even using ﬁne focus,
the image would be unacceptably blurred.

Images of the focal spots obtained in each conﬁguration are shown in ﬁgure 2.

The original and processed sets of

images were viewed and scored by two
independent observers both experienced in the use of mammographic image quality test
phantoms. The test images were graded using the 3, 2, 1, 0 scoring system recommended
in the TORMAM phantom instructions and adopted in surveys of mammographic image
quality in the UK Breast Screening Programme (Young and Ramsdale 2003).

4. Image processing procedure

The original images were in Siemens SPI ﬁle format which were 12-bit grayscale images
holding 10-bit image data. A conversion to DICOM format was necessary to allow
MATLAB to read the image data, but the conversion process retained all the luminance
information held in the original ﬁles.

MATLAB R12 was used to perform some preprocessing so that the subsequent

MEM processing could be applied. These steps were:

intensity proﬁles through particles in group A. The
preprocessing step reduces and ﬂattens the varying background of the image but leaves
the structure and noise intact. MEM processing smoothes the noise and increases the
signal-to-noise ratio of features deemed statistically to be caused by real objects.

• The original images have a varying background brightness caused by non-uniform
intensity of the X-ray beam (which is by design in mammographic systems) and
by variations in sensitivity over each digital plate (several such were used). To
make the images more amenable to MEM processing it was desirable to reduce this
background (Donoho et al 1992). A Gaussian low pass ﬁlter was constructed and
applied to the original images in the Fourier domain to obtain a background map.
This map was subtracted from the original leaving a ﬂattened image, which retained
the phantom’s high frequency features (see ﬁgure 3). It should be noted that the
Philips ACR-3 system is not a linear one, as each pixel value is proportional to
the logarithm of the number of photons striking the detector; however, as the raw
signal to mean background ratio is small (see ﬁgure 3), typically less than 0.1, this
procedure eﬀectively linearizes the system, necessary for application of any of the
methods discussed in section 2.

• Removal of spurious, bright pixels not corresponding to any real feature in the
TORMAM phantom. These pixels would lead to artefacts in the restored image.
The removal was done by observing the image histogram and setting high valued
outliers to some mean background level.

• The PSF images were cropped from the original TORMAM images. In each case

Mammographic image restoration using maximum entropy deconvolution

the noisy background of the PSF was ﬁltered out (typically by discarding those
pixels with less than 10% of the PSF peak value). This had the eﬀect of slightly
narrowing each PSF - thus leading to a conservative under-restoration.

MEMSYS5 was used to treat the images following the MATLAB preprocessing.
The interface to the MEMSYS5 kernel accepts image and PSF-image ﬁles as inputs
(MATLAB image format was convenient) and allows the setting of certain parameters
related to the theory described in section 2. The default image model m was deﬁned to
be a ﬂat image with low pixel luminance values: our belief that, in the absence of data,
very high photon counts were recorded (i.e. no absorption due to intervening material).
MEMSYS5 uses a slightly more sophisticated forward map that that presented in
equation (1).

The processed images contained between 2.2 million and 3.9 million pixels.
MEMSYS5 typically converged to a solution within 15 α-iterations with a processing
time of four to eight minutes, for an image of the full test object shown in ﬁgure 1.
The smaller images to be presented in ﬁgures 4 to 9 were cropped from such an image
after processing, rather than processed individually. The processed output ﬁles from
MEMSYS5 were 8-bit PNG ﬁles. All image processing was carried out on a Pentium 4
2.4GHz machine with 512MB of RAM.

5. Results

Before proceeding to a systematic comparison of the original and MEM processed
images and related scores, we will say a few words about our initial aspirations for this
technique. As mentioned in Section 1 these were to show improved spatial resolution
without reduction in signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer, particularly a
level of performance in which MEM processed 1.8BF images are at least as good as
unprocessed 1.8FF ones. Our belief is that such a performance would be of clinical
interest. Figures 4 and 5 compare appropriate images of a ﬁlament group and simulated
microcalciﬁcations. These ﬁgures show that MEM reconstruction can give improvements
in both resolution and perceived signal-to-noise ratio, and that the MEM processed
1.8BF images are marginally better in this instance than the 1.8FF unprocessed ones in
both respects. This promise encouraged us to undertake a systematic evaluation, and
to consider magniﬁcations greater than those normally used in clinical practice. Three
particle groups (B,D and E) were chosen for this evaluation. The nominal particle
size ranges for these groups are 180-283 µm, 106-177 µm and 90-141 µm respectively
(Cowen et al 1992). In addition to the scoring system mentioned earlier we also calculate
some signal to noise ratios (SNR) for these particular features.

Figure 6 shows images of the three particle groups, cropped from the images taken
under 1.8BF conditions. The selected particle group is clearly visible in ﬁgures 6 (a)
and (d), discernible in ﬁgure 6 (e), just discernible in ﬁgure 6 (b) and not seen in ﬁgures
6 (c) and (f); however, we show the latter images to preserve the two by three format,
which eases comparison with later improvements. As expected, unprocessed images

MEM processed images show signiﬁcant improvements in resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio, particularly regarding the high frequency noise, which were quantiﬁed using cuts

similar to that shown in ﬁgure 3; the quoted SNR is the diﬀerence between the largest
signal and the mean background within each group, divided by the standard deviation
of the signal in a region close to the group. Figures for Group B are SNRorig = 9.0 and
SNRMEM = 50.3. Group D: SNRorig = 5.9 and SNRMEM = 13.7. Particle group E is not
detected at this setting.

Figure 7 shows cropped images of the same three particle groups, obtained with the
conventional 1.8FF conﬁguration. Remarks regarding group visibility are as for ﬁgure 6.
The pinhole PSF imaged under these conditions is small and approximately Gaussian in
shape, comprising just a few pixels. As expected, images obtained in this conﬁguration
are sharper than in the 1.8BF case; nevertheless MEM restoration still shows signiﬁcant
improvements. SNR measurements for Group B are SNRorig = 9.0 and SNRMEM = 49.8.
Group D: SNRorig = 5.4 and SNRMEM = 18.5. Particle group E is not detected at this
setting.

Figure 8 shows cropped images of the same three particle groups, obtained with

in the original image of the phantom, but the MEM processed images show clear
improvements in resolution, enabling ﬁne details of individual microcalciﬁcations to
be discerned in image (d). SNR measurements for Group B are SNRorig = 8.8 and
SNRMEM = 49.8. Group D: SNRorig = 5.8 and SNRMEM = 22.4. Group E: SNRorig = 5.2
and SNRMEM = 10.4.

To eﬀect the same comparison as that illustrated in ﬁgure 5, between unprocessed
1.8FF images and MEM processed 1.8BF ones, the bottom row in ﬁgure 6 should be
compared with the top row in ﬁgure 7.

Figure 9 shows images of ﬁlament groups B, D and F taken with the 1.8FF
conﬁguration. These respectively have diameters 0.35, 0.25 and 0.20 mm, length 10
mm. All three groups are detectable in the original and MEM processed images, but
again the latter show improvements in resolution and visibility. To avoid information
overload we do not show the 1.8BF and 3.00FF cases here, but experience with these
matches that with the particle groups, and is quantiﬁed in the table of scores discussed
below.

The results obtained from scoring the original and MEM processed images under
each of the three imaging geometries are shown in Table 1. The processed images show
an improved score in each case. This implies that the signal-to-noise ratio perceived by
the observers for the various test features, including low contrast objects, was increased
by the application of the MEM processing.

6. Discussion

The aim of the work was to demonstrate an improvement in spatial resolution for
realistic radiological images from MEM de-blurring, with no associated penalty in
terms of reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer. The expected
resolution improvements are shown in ﬁgures 6-9. Somewhat unexpected, however,

were the improvements in image score shown in Table 1, as most of the features in
the TORMAM phantom, i.e. the ﬁbre groups and disks, are essentially low-contrast
features whose detection would be expected to be limited by the relative noise level in
the image. The improvement in scores therefore implies an improvement in signal-to-
noise ratio for this phantom. For the ﬁlaments and particles, which are comparable
to the PSF in extent, improvements in visibility are eﬀected by enhanced intensity and
sharpness due to focussing, and by noise reduction. For the disks, which are signiﬁcantly
larger than the PSF, sharpness (resulting in easier edge detection) and noise reduction
are the important factors.

It may be that the improvements in features imaged against a uniform background,
as in these demonstrations, are better than those which might be achieved when imaging
diagnostic features against an anatomical background. Suitable experiments are under
way.

There are a number of possible applications of MEM deconvolution in radiology.
This paper has demonstrated the use of high geometric magniﬁcation in conjunction
with a relatively large focal spot. Other options might be to use larger focal spot tubes
to increase heat capacity and therefore allow extremely short exposures, or high outputs
which could be used with high ﬁltration. Other deconvolution problems in radiology
include light scatter in image intensiﬁer optics and reduction of the eﬀects of scattered
radiation.

7. Conclusion

An image processing approach based on a maximum entropy method has been applied to
the problem of restoring focal spot geometric blurring in magniﬁcation mammography.
The results show an improvement in image spatial resolution and an improvement in
terms of the image signal-to-noise ratio perceived by the observer, as evaluated using a
standard phantom and at a realistic quantum noise level. This successful demonstration
of image de-blurring in noisy radiological images oﬀers the possibility of weakening the
link between focal spot size and geometric blurring in radiology, and thus opening up

new approaches to system optimization.

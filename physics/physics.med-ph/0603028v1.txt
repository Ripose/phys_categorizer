Abstract

In this paper we consider the age-related alterations of heart rate variability on the basis of

the study of non-Markovian eﬀects. The age dynamics of relaxation processes is quantitatively

described by means of local relaxation parameters, calculated by the speciﬁc localization procedure.

We oﬀer a quantitative informational measure of non-Markovity to evaluate the change of statistical

eﬀects of memory. Local relaxation parameters for young and elderly people diﬀer by 3.3 times,

and quantitative measures of non-Markovity diﬀer by 4.2 times. The comparison of quantitative

parameters allows to draw conclusions about the reduction of relaxation rate with ageing and the

higher degree of the Markovity of heart rate variability of elderly people.

INTRODUCTION

The ageing of a human organism has been in the focus of attention in physics of live

systems over the past years. One of the most signiﬁcant systems of vital activity of a human

body is its cardiovascular system. Today there are a number of scientiﬁc studies on the

problems of biological ageing of the cardiovascular human system. The latter is extremely

sensitive to age-related as well as pathological changes in a human organism. Thus not

only physiologists, biologists and physicians have been involved in this studies but also

experts from other natural-science areas. Conditions of a human heart are estimated by

means of various parameters. Thus heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most

frequently used parameters, in cardiology. Nowadays there are diﬀerent methods of studying

heart rate variability dynamics. In recent years [1], ﬂuctuations of heartbeat dynamics have

been studied by means of several methods derived from nonlinear dynamics and statistical

physics, such as detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [2, 3], spectral analysis [4], entropy

[5, 6, 7], correlation dimension [8]. In paper [9] authors illustrate the problems related to

the physiological signal analysis with representative examples of human heartbeat dynamics

under healthy and pathological conditions which is based on two methods: power spectrum

and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis.

In this paper diﬀerent characteristics of heartbeat:

1/f ﬂuctuations, long-range anticorrelations (monofractal analysis), self-similar cascades,

multifractality and nonlinearity are considered. By means of a wavelet-based multifractal

formalism it is shown that healthy human heartbeat dynamics exhibits higher complexity

which is characterized by a broad multifractal spectrum.

In paper [10] multiresolution

wavelet analysis has been used to study the heart rate variability in a patient with diﬀerent

pathological conditions. Noise eﬀects of abnormal heartbeats were considered in paper [11].

The correlation exceptions of heartbeat dynamics of diﬀerent sleep stages often have been

researched lately. In papers [12, 13] correlation properties of the magnitude and the sign of

increments in the time intervals between successive heartbeats during a light sleep, a deep

2

sleep, a rapid eye movement sleep were discovered by means of the detrended ﬂuctuation

analysis. Multiscaled randomness [14], multifractal analysis [15], simulation by non-linear

oscillators [16], fractal approach based on scaling of a frequency spectrum on power law 1/ωα

[17], quantitative analysis [18] are also used to analyze heart rate variability. The change

of correlations and statistical memory eﬀects is one of the must important questions [19] in

heart rate variability dynamics observed with ageing [1, 4].

Among existing methods of researching HRV one can diﬀerentiate the methods of esti-

mating HRV in a time area, spectral methods of estimating HRV in a frequency area, as

well as nonlinear methods. The last group of methods has proved to be a powerful means to

study various complex systems and has brought about signiﬁcant achievements in processing

biological and medical data. In recent years universal methods of statistical physics have

been more often used in medicine and biology. The methods of statistical physics which

have been used to research real complex systems [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], in the ﬁeld of

cardiology reveal essentially new opportunities for the analysis, diagnostics and forecasting

the processes of biological ageing and diseases of a human heart. They disclose dynamic

features of HRV, latent for classical medical methods of research.

In this paper we oﬀer a new method of study of the problems of ageing of a human

heart activity, based on our theory of discrete non-Markov processes [20]. This theory has

already found practical application in cardiology [21], neurophysiology [22, 23], the study of

locomotor and sensomotor activity [22], epidemiology [24] and seismology [25].

II. BASIC CONCEPTS AND DEFINITION OF THE STATISTICAL THEORY

OF NONSTATIONARY DISCRETE NON-MARKOV PROCESSES IN COMPLEX

SYSTEMS

The obtained data were processed by means of the above declared technique. We use the

results of our recent theory of discrete non-Markov random processes for the quantitative

3

description of Markovian and non-Markovian components in stochastic alteration of the

registered data. The set of three memory functions was calculated for each sequence of the

data. Frequency power spectra for each of these functions are obtained by using the fast

Fourier transform. For a more detailed analysis of the properties of the system we also

consider the frequency spectrum of the ﬁrst three points of the statistical spectrum of the

non-Markovity parameter. The spectrum of the non-Markovity parameter was introduced

earlier in the following articles [20, 21, 25]. In this study we use the frequency spectrum of

the non-Markovity parameter:

here i = 1, 2, 3... is the number of the relaxation level, µi(ω) is the Fourier-transform and

a power spectrum of the ith level memory function Mi(t) (see, Eq. (1) below). The pa-

rameters εi(ω) allow to receive the quantitative estimation of long-term memory eﬀects in

the experimental time series of the data as shown in Ref. [26]. From the physical point of

view the parameter εi(ω) allows to mark out the three most important cases [26]. Markov

and completely randomized processes correspond to values ε → ∞, quasi-Markov processes

(memory eﬀects can be noticed there ) correspond to values ε > 1. The limiting case with

ε ∼ 1 concerns the situation with non-Markov processes, i.e., processes, where there is

long-range memory.

In early works [20, 21, 25] we came to the following chain of connected non-Markov

ﬁnite-diﬀerence kinetic equations (t = mτ ):

∆Mn(t)
∆t

= λn+1Mn(t) − τ Λn+1

Mn+1(jτ )Mn(t − jτ ).

(1)

Here parameters λn+1 represent eigen values of the Liouville’s quasioperator. The relaxation

parameters of Λn+1 are determined as follows:

describes statistical memory in complex systems with a discrete time (A0

are vectors of the initial and ﬁnal states of the studied system).

In paper [20] we have

received the recurrent formula on the basis of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure,

in which the senior dynamic variable Wn = Wn(t) is connected with the junior one in the

following way:

W0 = A0

k(0), W1 = {i ˆL − λ1}W0, . . .

(3)

Wn = {i ˆL − λn−1}Wn−1 + Λn−1Wn−2 + ..., n > 1.

The initial time correlation function (TCF) a(t) and the set of discrete memory functions

Mn(t) in Eq. (1) are important for further consideration. The ﬁrst three equations of this

chain (t = mτ is a discrete time) can be presented as follows:

= − τ Λ1

M1(jτ )a(t − jτ ) + λ1a(t),

= − τ Λ2

This system of ﬁnite-diﬀerence Eqs. (1), (4) is a discrete analogue of the well-known chain

of kinetic Zwanzig’-Mori’s equations. The latter plays the fundamental role in modern

It is necessary

to note that the chain of Zwanzig’-Mori’s equations is valid only for quantum and classical

Hamiltonian systems with a continuous time. The chain of ﬁnite-diﬀerence kinetic Eqs. (1),

(4) is valid for complex systems, in which there is no Hamiltonian, the time is discrete,

and there are no exact equations of motion. However, ”dynamics” and ”motion” in real

complex systems undoubtedly exist and can be registered in the experiment. The ﬁrst three

equations in the chain (4) form a basis for the quasihydrodynamic description of stochastic

discrete processes in complex systems. The application of Eq. (1) opens up new possibilities

in the detailed analysis of the statistical properties of correlations in complex systems. The

existence of ﬁnite-diﬀerence Eqs. (1), (4) allows to evaluate unknown memory functions

(similarly time correlation functions) directly from the experimental data.

Let’s determine the experimental relaxation time τE by the equation:

τE = ∆t

a(tj).

N

j=1
X

(5)

Using the experimental data now we can deﬁne the relaxation time of the studied system.

Further we can compare the experimental time τE with the theoretical one. The theoretical

relaxation time τE (where i = 1, 2, 3... is the number of approximation) can be determined

on the basis of Zwanzig’-Mori’s equations for various correlation approximations. For the

ﬁrst age group (young people) better accordance between the experimental and theoretical

times is gained in the 6th correlation approximation: M3(t) = M1(t) (see Table 1). This one

shows the presence of long-range memory in the considered system. For the examined group

of elderly persons better accordance of relaxation times is received in the ﬁrst correlation

approximation M1(t) = a(t) (see Table 1).

It indicates to the existence of short-range

memory in this group.

Using the Laplace transform on the ﬁrst three Zwanzig’-Mori’s equations, we shall receive:

One can solve this system by means of various approximations. For the approximation

M1(t) = a(t) (the ﬁrst approximation in Table 1) we shall receive:

s ˜M1(s) − 1 = λ2 ˜M1(s) − Λ2 ˜M1(s) ˜M2(s),

III. EXPERIMENTAL DATA

We used the time series of R-R intervals in young and elderly subjects as the experimental

data [4]. Two groups of healthy human subjects: 10 young (mean age 27 yr, range 21-34

yr) and 10 elderly (mean age 74 yr, range 68-81 yr), participated in this study. Each group

consisted of ﬁve women and ﬁve men. All subjects provided written informed consent and

underwent a screening history, physical examination, routine blood count and biochemical

tests, electrocardiogram, and exercise tolerance test. Only healthy, nonsmoking subjects

with normal exercise tolerance tests, without any medical problems, and being on no medi-

cation were admitted to the study.

All subjects remained in an inactive state in sinus rhythm while watching the movie

”Fantasia” (Disney) to maintain wakefulness. Each heartbeat was annotated by means of

an automated arrhythmia detection algorithm, and each beat annotation was veriﬁed by

visual inspection. The R-R interval (interbeat interval) of time series for each subject was

then computed [4].

IV. DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS

The basic outcomes are submitted in this section. Further the appropriate analysis of the

experimental data will be carried out both for young and old people. Two new qualitative

procedures of the appropriate analysis have been used. The procedure of the window-

time behavior shows great oscillations of an R-R interval for the power spectra of memory

8

functions with respiratory arrhythmia. The calculation of the local relaxation parameters is

carried out by means of the procedure of time localization. The decrease of the relaxation

rate in ageing people is indicated through the time dependence of the localized relaxation

parameters. The quantitative assessment of non-Markovity eﬀects of heart rate variability

is carried out by means of a special measure.

A. Study of age-related alterations of heart rate variability

Further we submitted ﬁgures for one young and one old person. The ﬁgures reﬂect a

general pattern of the group. Below we show the analysis which describes the experimental

data for the ﬁrst and second group.

In Fig. 1 we have presented the time series of the ﬁrst four dynamic orthogonal variables

Wi, where i = 0, ..., 3 for young (Figs. 1a-d) and elderly (Figs. 1e-h) people. The time

series of the elderly people diﬀer in greater amplitude and frequency of ﬂuctuations of an

R-R interval. The scattering interval of the oscillations of an R-R interval for young people

constitutes (0.83τ ÷ 1.18τ , where τ = 1.0244s, τ -time of discretization). The variability of

an R-R interval in elderly people changes within the limit of (0.92τ ÷1.5τ , where τ = 1.062s)

for the initial signal. The frequency of ﬂuctuations of an R-R interval in elderly people is

greater than in young people. The normal cardiac activity of elderly people is accompanied

by more randomized ﬂuctuations of an R-R interval.

In Fig. 2 we have presented the phase portraits for the variability of an R-R interval

in young and elderly people on six plane projections of the ﬁrst four dynamic orthogonal

variables. The phase clouds of the young and elderly people are symmetric concerning the

origin of coordinates frame. The phase clouds have a centered nucleus. The nucleus encloses

some points, speckled on the perimeter. The phase points for elderly people have a 2-3 times

greater interval of a scattering, due to the presence of more appreciable oscillations of an

R-R interval.

Figure 1: The time series of the ﬁrst four dynamic orthogonal variables Wi, where i = 0, .., 3 for the

young (a-d) and the elderly persons (e-h). The time series of the elderly person is accompanied by

more signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations of an R-R interval. The time series of elderly person is characterized

by greater frequency of occurrence of signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations. It shows higher degree of Markovity

of the ﬂuctuations of an R-R interval for the elderly person.

In Fig. 3 we have presented the power spectra of the initial TCF µ0(ω) (Fig. 3a) and

the ﬁrst three memory functions of younger orders µi(ω) (where i = 1, 2, 3) (Figs. 3b-d)

for young and elderly people. The ﬁgures are submitted on a log-log scale. The power

spectrum of the initial TCF for the elderly person diﬀers in smaller dynamic fractures in

the area of low frequencies. It is possible to ﬁnd dynamic splashes (dynamic peaks) on all

ﬁgures in the area of frequencies (0.2f.u. < ω < 0.5f.u., where 1f.u. = 1/τ ), in particular.

These dynamic peaks appear due to respiratory arrhythmia. The given dynamic splashes

remind of the well known shape of the Suyumbike Tower [21]. The increase of the power

spectrum on these frequencies reﬂects age-physiological changes. Ageing people develop a

shift of these dynamic peaks in the range of high frequencies. The dynamic peaks, which

relate to the respiratory arrhythmia of the young man, are discovered within the frequency

interval of 0.25f.u. < ω < 0.45f.u. These dynamic splashes of the elderly person are in the

range of 0.4f.u. < ω < 0.55f.u.. The speciﬁc arrhythmia of cardiac activity at respiration

accounts for this conclusion. This frequency (at respiratory arrhythmia) in elderly persons

is higher than in young ones.

The procedure construction of the window-time behavior of the power spectra of memory

functions leads to the similar conclusion. The similar procedure allows to consider in detail

of this procedure consists in the following [23]. Originally it is necessary to determine the

optimal length of the sample. When the length of the sample is small, the ”accumulated”

information will be insuﬃcient for carrying out a qualitative correlation analysis due to

gross errors and the inﬂuence of noise eﬀects. When the length of the sampling is large the

necessary ”sensitivity” weakens. The analysis of samples of diﬀerent lengths shows, that

the optimal length for this procedure constitutes 28 = 256 points. From the initial array of

the experimental data we take 256 initial points. We receive the ﬁrst window of 256 points.

12

Then we build a memory function power spectrum for this sample and take the next window

of 256 points (from 257 to 512). Then we build the power spectrum of the memory function.

This procedure is carried out repeatedly up to the end of the sampling of the experimental

data. In Fig. 4 the time-window behavior of the ﬁrst memory function µ1(ω) in young and

elderly people is submitted. The most appreciable dynamic splashes (peaks) in the power

spectra are connected with respiratory arrhythmia. All dynamic peaks are found in the

particular range of frequencies. Generally in young people the range of these dynamic peaks

meets 0.25f.u. < ω < 0.45f.u.. For elderly people this range is shifted to the right and

meets 0.4f.u. < ω < 0.55f.u. This implies ampliﬁcation of cardiac activity at respiration

with ageing.

B. Quantitative measure of the eﬀects of non-Markovity in heart rate variability

Any complex system has a great number of degrees of freedom. The high dimension of

complex systems, the presence of strong nonlinear interactions and the feedback determine

their behavior. This behavior can be characterized by Markov random processes. Strong

external inﬂuence at accidents, crises and human diseases entails partial synchronization of

natural chaotic behavior of complex systems. This synchronization results in the compelled

organization of the structure of a real system and the occurrence of regular communica-

tions. The behavior of the system becomes more ordered. Such behavior is deﬁned by the

ampliﬁcation of non-Markov statistical eﬀects.

The basic idea of our method consists in deﬁning the quantitative proportion between

Markov and non-Markov eﬀects of the studied stochastic process. As a quantitative measure

of non-Markovity we suggest using the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ω),

where ω = 0f.u. The physical sense of this parameter consists in distinguishing Markov (pro-

cesses with instant or short memory) and non-Markov (processes with long-range memory)

stochastic processes. The increase of this parameter (ε1(0) >> 1) means greater Markovity

of conditions of the system, the reduction of this parameter describes the processes with

statistical eﬀects of non-Markovity. The increase or decrease of the non-Markovity param-

eter makes it possible to judge the degree of non-Markovity in the complex system. Thus

non-Markov eﬀects are characterized by the presence of long-range correlations and the

ampliﬁcation of statistical displays of long-range memory. Markovian processes are charac-

terized by the ampliﬁcation of short-range correlations and the reduction of the eﬀects of

statistical memory. The quantitative measure of non-Markovity ε1(0) =

study. The value of this parameter for the young man is equal to 6.24. For the elderly person the

rameter εi(ω), where i = 1, 2, 3 in young and elderly people, is submitted. The value of a

quantitative measure of the degree of non-Markovity of the young man is ε1(0) = 6.24. The

value of this parameter of the elderly person is ε1(0) = 23.16. The ratio of the quantitative

measures of non-Markovity is 3.7 times. It testiﬁes to the increase of Markovian eﬀects in

ﬂuctuations of an R-R interval with ageing. Markovity of heart rate variability is connected

with signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the initial signal of the elderly person.

Further we have presented statistical results of processing for the ﬁrst and second age

groups.

In Fig. 6 we have presented the ﬁrst points of the non-Markovian parameter,

The value of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(0)av.val of young people is

6.41. The value of this parameter for elderly people is equal to 27.41. The ratio of these

values is 4.2 times. It testiﬁes to the ampliﬁcation of Markov eﬀects in the heart activity

in elderly people. Therefore the number of Markov components aﬀecting the heart activity

increases with ageing.

C. Age-related alterations of relaxation modes

The local relaxation parameters allow to estimate the relaxation rate in the systems.

The procedure of localization enables to reveal internal peculiarities of the dynamics of

cardiac activity, latent for usual correlation analysis. The idea of the method consist in the

following. From the initial time series we take a sampling N points in length for which we

calculate kinetic and relaxation parameters. Then we performed ”step-by-step shift to the

right” operation one interval to the right and calculate kinetic and relaxation parameters.

This procedure is carried out up to the end of the time series. Thus received local relaxation

parameters have high sensitivity eﬀects of alternation and non-stationarity. If there is any

irregularity in the initial time series it will be instantly revealed in the time behavior of local

parameters.

When using this method (as well as in the ﬁrst procedure) it is necessary to deﬁne the

length of the sample which allows to receive the most trustworthy information. As a result

Thus, using diﬀerent approaches in the research of the time series of an R-R interval we

have arrived at the general conclusion. The work of a heart becomes more Markov (the

eﬀects of statistical memory disappear) with ageing and the speed of relaxation of cardiac

activity is reduced.

V. CONCLUSION

The achieved results allow to come to the following conclusions. The procedure of lo-

calization makes it possible to calculate quantitative characteristics describing the speed of

relaxation of cardiac activity. We have revealed essential distinctions in relaxation processes

for diﬀerent age groups on the basis of the comparative analysis of quantitative characteris-

tics of variability of an R-R interval. The processes occurring in the heart of a young person,

have a greater relaxation rate. Hence, at the appearance of any destructions in cardiac ac-

tivity, faster restoration of its usual normal mode can be observed. The relaxation rate of

cardiac activity decreases in elderly people. Heart activity comes back to its normal rhythm

slower in this case.

The use of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ω) allows to estimate quan-

titatively Markovian and non-Markovian eﬀects of heart rate variability. The work of a heart

19

of an older person is characterized by greater Markovity due to the inﬂuence of a greater

number of components, that reduce the eﬀects of long-range memory (deterioration of an

organism, ageing and physiological changes of a heart and other life-support systems etc.).

The comparison of values of the parameter ε1(ω) for young and elderly people (their ratio

is equal to 4.2 in case of ω = 0f.u.), indicates a high degree of Markovity of heart rate

variability of elderly people. The heart rate variability of young people is characterized by

greater non-Markovity, that indicates the smaller number of its Markov components. Thus,

the number of Markov components of cardiac activity increases with age.

These conclusions are interconnected and supplement each other. The increase of the

number of Markov components, aﬀecting cardiac activity, results in the increase of the

relaxation time of a system. The system needs greater time for restoration to the normal

operating mode. It is caused by the decrease of long-range correlations and reduction of the

eﬀects of statistical memory with ageing. On the contrary, the increase of the relaxation

rate of a system testiﬁes to the increase of the number of regular components. For example,

the eﬀects of statistical memory and long-range correlations are ampliﬁed the dynamics of

HRV. A higher relaxation rate is characteristic of normal heart activity.

The procedure of the window-time behavior allows to ﬁnd out additional age features of

cardiac activity of a person. The frequency of cardiac reductions at breath increases with

age. It shows the age-related displacement of dynamic bursts (connected with respiratory

arrhythmia) in the area of higher frequencies.

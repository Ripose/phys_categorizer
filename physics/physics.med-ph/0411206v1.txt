Abstract.
In this paper we show that diﬀerent physiological states and pathological
conditions may be characterized in terms of predictability of time series signals from
the underlying biological system. In particular we consider systolic arterial pressure
time series from healthy subjects and Chronic Heart Failure patients, undergoing
paced respiration. We model time series by the regularized least squares approach
and quantify predictability by the leave-one-out error. We ﬁnd that the entrainment
mechanism connected to paced breath, that renders the arterial blood pressure signal
more regular, thus more predictable,
is less eﬀective in patients, and this eﬀect
correlates with the seriousness of the heart failure. The leave-one-out error separates
controls from patients and, when all orders of nonlinearity are taken into account, alive
patients from patients for which cardiac death occurred.

1. Introduction

2

Physiological signals derived from humans are extraordinarily complex, as they reﬂect
ongoing processes involving very complicated regulation mechanisms (Glass 2001), and
can be used to diagnose incipient pathophysiological conditions. Many approaches to
characterization and analysis of physiological signals have been introduced in recent
years, including, for example, studies of: Fourier spectra (Akselrod et al 1981, Pinna
et al 2002), chaotic dynamics (Babloyantz et al 1985, Poon and Merrill 1997), wavelet
analysis (Thurner et al 1998, Marrone et al 1999), scaling properties (Nunes Amaral et
al , 1998, Ashkenazy et al 2001, Ivanov and Lo 2002), multifractal properties (Ivanov et
al 1999, Nunes Amaral et al 2001), correlation integrals (Lehnertz and Elger 1998), 1/f
spectra (Peng et al 1993, Ivanov et al 2001) and synchronization properties (Schafer
et al 1998, Tass et al 1998, Angelini et al 2004). Less attention has been paid to
the degree of determinism (Kantz and Schreiber 1997) of a physiological time series.
It is the purpose of the present work to show that diﬀerent physiological states, or
pathological conditions, may be characterized in terms of predictability of time series.
In particular we consider here predictability of Systolic Blood Pressure (SAP) time series
under paced respiration, and show that a suitable index separates healthy subjects
from Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) patients. Systolic blood pressure (SAP) is the
maximal pressure within the cardiovascular system as the heart pumps blood into
the arteries. Paced respiration (breathing is synchronized with some external signal)
is a well-established experimental procedure to regularize and standardize respiratory
activity during autonomic laboratory investigations (Cooke et al 1998), and a useful
tool for relaxation and for the treatment of chronic pain and insomnia, dental and
facial pain, etc. (Clark and Hirschman 1980, Clark and Hirschman 1990, Freedman and
Woodward 1992). Entrainment between heart and respiration rate (cardiorespiratory
synchronization) has been detected in subjects undergoing paced respiration (Schiek et
al 1997, Pomortsev et al 1998). Paced breathing can prevent vasovagal syncope during
head-up tilt testing (Jauregui-Renaud et al 2003); in healthy subjects under paced
respiration the synchronization between the main processes governing cardiovascular
system is stronger than the synchronization in the case of spontaneous respiration
(Prokhorov et al 2003). However, a number of important questions remain open about
paced breathing, including the dependence on the frequency of respiration and whether
it aﬀects the autonomic balance. In a healthy cardiorespiratory system, the regime of
paced respiration induces regularization of related physiological signals (Brown Troy et
al 1993, Pinna et al 2003), in particular blood pressure time series smoothen and become
more deterministic. To quantify this phenomenon, we face two problems at this point:
(i) how may we model the SAP time series? (ii) what measure of predictability is the
most suitable? In the present paper we model time series by Regularized Least Squares
(RLS) approach (Mukherjee et al 2002). The choice of this class of models is motivated
by the fact that it enjoys several interesting properties. The most important is that
such models have high generalization capacity. This means that they are able to predict

complex signals when a ﬁnite and small number of observations of the signal itself are
available. Moreover the degree of nonlinearity present in the modelling, introduced
by a kernel method, may be easily controlled. Finally they allow an easy calculation
of the leave-one-out (LOO) error (Vapnik 1998), the quantity that we use to quantify
predictability. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time RLS models are used to model time
series; our approach generalizes the classical autoregressive (AR) approach to time series
analysis (Kantz and Schreiber 1997). It is worth mentioning that recently (Shalizi et al
2004) a measure of self-organization, rooted on optimal predictors, has been proposed.
In the same spirit, LOO prediction error is related to the degree of organization of the
underlying physiological system.

2. Method

2.1. Regularized least squares linear models for regression

(xi, yi)

ℓ
Let us consider a set of ℓ independent, identically distributed data S =
i=1,
where xi is the n-dimensional vector of input variables and yi is the scalar output
variable. Data are drawn from an unknown probability distribution p(x, y). The
problem of learning consists in providing an estimator fw : x
y, out of a class
of functions F (w), called hypothesis space, parametrized by a vector w. Let us ﬁrst
consider the class of linear functions y = w
x, where w is the n-dimensional vector of
·
parameters. To provide a bias term in the linear function (to be included if x or y have
non vanishing mean), a supplementary input variable (constant and equal to one) is to
be included in the input vector. In the regularized least squares approach, w is chosen
so as to minimize the following functional:

evaluated on the training data; the second one (regularization term) can be motivated
geometrically by the following considerations. Let us view data (xi, yi) as points in
a (n + 1)-dimensional space. Each function y = w
x determines an hyperplane
in this space, approximating data points. The prediction square error on point i is
xi)2; let di be the square distance between the point and the approximating
ǫi = (yi −

It is easy to minimize functional L and get the optimal hyperplane:

estimator. What matters is the generalization ability, i.e. the prediction error on data
points which have not been used to train the estimator. The following measure of the
generalization performance, known as LOO procedure, is both intuitive and statistically
robust (one can show that LOO error is almost unbiased, see Luntz and Brailovsky 1969).
For each i, data point i is removed from the data set. The approximating hyperplane is
then determined on the basis of the residual set of ℓ
1 points; the square prediction
−
error by this hyperplane on point i will be denoted ǫloo
. The LOO error is then deﬁned as
follows: Eloo = 1/ℓ
. In principle, calculation of Eloo requires the estimation of ℓ
hyperplanes, thus rendering this procedure unfeasible, or at least unpractical. However
the class of models, we are considering here, allows calculating LOO error after inversion

The value of the parameter λ is to be tuned to minimize the LOO error. In other
words, this free parameter is to be tuned to enhance the generalization capability of the
model. It is useful, for the nonlinear extension of these models, to express w as a linear
combination of the vectors xi for i = 1, 2, ..., ℓ. Indeed, if ℓ > n one can suppose that

Equations (9,10) shows that the evaluation of the linear predictor as well as the
computation of the parameter vector c involve only scalar products of data in the input
space. This property allows to extend the regularized linear models to the non linear
case, as we describe in the next subsection.

2.2. Nonlinear models

The extension to the general case of non linear predictors is done by mapping the input
vectors x in a higher dimensional space
, called feature space, and looking for a linear
predictor in this new space. Let Φ(x)
be the image of the point x in the feature
space, with:

H
∈ H

Φ(x) = (φ1(x), φ2(x), ..., φN (x), ...)

}

{

φ

where
are real functions. Note that the number of components of the feature space
can be ﬁnite, countable or even inﬁnite uncountable. Moreover, suppose that one of the
features be constant. This hypothesis allows to write the linear predictor in the feature
space
without making explicit the bias term. In the feature space induced by the
mapping Φ, a linear predictor takes the form:

H

y = f (x) = w

Φ(x)

·

(11)

where now w, according to the nature of the feature space, may have ﬁnite or inﬁnite
number of components. Again, we hypothesize that w may be written as a linear
combination of the vectors Φ(xi) with i = 1, 2, ..., ℓ (if this hypothesis would not be met,
we thus determine a solution, constrained in the subspace, of the feature space, spanned

Leave-one-out prediction error ...

}i=1,ℓ). This means that there exist ℓ coeﬃcients (c1, c2, ..., cℓ)⊤ such

by vectors
that:

{

In this hypothesis, the linear predictor in the feature space

takes the form:

and, therefore, will be non-linear in the original input variables. The vector c is given
by (9) with K the ℓ
Φ(xj). Note that
the evaluation of the predictor on new data points and the deﬁnition of the matrix K
involve the computation of scalar products between vectors in the feature space, which
can be computationally prohibitive if the number of features is very large. A possible
solution to these problems consists in making the following choice:

×

·

Φ(x) = (√α1ψ1(x), √α2ψ2(x), ..., √αN ψN (x), ...)

where αi and ψi are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an integral operator whose
kernel K(x, y) is a positive deﬁnite symmetric function. With this choice, the scalar
product in the feature space becomes particularly simple because

Φ(xi)

Φ(xj) =

αγψγ(xi)ψγ(xj) = K(xi, xj),

where the last equality comes from the Mercer-Hilbert-Schmidt theorem for positive
deﬁnite functions (Riesz and Nagy 1955). The predictor has, in this case, the form:

where the matrix G can be shown to be equal to K (K + λI)
. Many choices of the
kernel function are possible, for example the polynomial kernel of degree p has the form
y)p (the corresponding features are made of all the powers of x up to
K(x, y) = (1 + x
2/2σ2) and deals with
the p-th). The RBF Gaussian kernel is K(x, y) = exp
all the degrees of nonlinearity of x. Specifying the kernel function K one determines the
complexity of the function space within which we search the predictor, similarly to the
eﬀect of specifying the architecture of a neural network, that is number of layers, number
of units for each layer, type of activation functions which deﬁne the set of functions that
the neural network implements. Notice that, depending on the kernel function, we
can have a countable or even an uncountable number of features. The last case apply,
for example, to the Gaussian function. Use of kernel functions to implicitly perform
projections, the kernel trick, is at the basis of Support Vector Machines, a technique
which has found application in several ﬁelds, including Medicine (Bazzani et al 2001).

9 years, LVEF: 28

Our data are from 47 healthy volunteers (age: 53
8 years, M/F: 40/7) and 275 patients
with chronic heart failure (CHF) (age: 52
8%, NYHA class:
±
0.7, M/F: 234/41), caused mainly by ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
2.1
(48% and 44% respectively), consecutively referred to the Heart Failure Unit of the
Scientiﬁc Institute of Montescano, S. Maugeri Foundation (Italy) for evaluation and
treatment of advanced heart failure. Concerning the second group, cardiac death
occurred in 54 (20%) of the patients during a 3-year follow-up, while the other 221
patients were still alive at the end of the follow-up period. All the subjects underwent a
10 min supine resting recording in paced respiration regime (Cooke et al 1998, Rzeczinski
et al 2002). To perform paced breathing, subjects were asked to follow a digitally
recorded human voice inducing inspiratory and expiratory phases, at 0.25 Hz frequency.
Non invasive recording of arterial blood pressure at the ﬁnger (Finapres device) was
performed. For each cardiac cycle, corresponding values of SAP were computed and
re-sampled at a frequency of 2 Hz using a cubic spline interpolation. As an example In
Fig. 2 we report the SAP time series for one of the subjects.

major rhythms of heart rate and blood pressure variability. All the formalism previously
described is applied to model the dependency of y from x, i.e. to forecast the time series
on the basis of m previous values: LOO error is a robust measure of its predictability.
We use Gaussian kernel and polynomial of 1, 2 and 3 degree.

To show the role of the parameter λ, in ﬁg. 3 we depict, for a typical control subject,
both the LOO error and the empirical error versus λ. As λ increases, the empirical risk
monotonically increases, whilst the LOO error shows a minimum at a ﬁnite value of λ
ensuring the best generalization capability. We ﬁx the value of λ once for all subjects, by
minimizing the average LOO error on a subset made of an equal number of control and
CHF time series. This procedure yields λ = 0.01 for Gaussian kernel and polynomial
of 1, 2 degree, whilst for the third order polynomial kernel the optimal value we ﬁnd is
λ = 0.1.

Figure 3. For a typical control subject, the LOO error (continuous line) and
the empirical error (dashed line) are represented versus λ. A Gaussian kernel,
with σ = 8.5, is used.

We thus evaluate the LOO error for all the 322 subjects (Table 1). In any case,
healthy subjects are characterized by a smaller LOO error than patients. Moreover, dead
CHF patients show greater LOO error than still alive patients. Hence the seriousness
of the heart disease appears to be correlated to the LOO error. The regularized linear
model seems to be the best model of SAP time series. We verify that LOO errors
from controls and patients are Gaussianly distributed and check the homogeneity of the
variances of the two groups; we apply the t-test to evaluate the probability that LOO
error values, relative to controls and patients, were drawn from the same distribution
(the null hypothesis) (table 2). For all kernels, the null hypothesis can be rejected, also
after the Bonferroni correction (which lowers the threshold to 0.05/4 = 0.0125). The

Gaussian kernel shows the best separation between the two classes. We have also tested
the separation between dead and alive patients, and the results are also displayed in
Table 2. Only when the Gaussian kernel is used the p-value is lower than 0.0125: since
all orders of nonlinearities contribute to the Gaussian modelling, this result suggests
that the phenomenon here outlined is an eﬀect with strong nonlinear contributions.

4. Discussion

We show that LOO prediction error of physiological time series may usefully be used
as a measure of organization of the underlying regulation mechanisms, and can thus be
used to detect changes of physiological state and pathological conditions. We propose
use of RLS models to time series prediction because they allow fast calculation of the
LOO error and their degree of nonlinearity can be easily controlled. We consider here
the SAP time series in healthy subjects undergoing paced breath, and in patients with
heart disease. We ﬁnd that the entrainment mechanism connected to paced breath, that
renders the arterial blood pressure signal more deterministic, thus more predictable, is
less eﬀective in patients, and this eﬀect correlates with the seriousness of the heart
failure; paced breathing conditions seem suitable for diagnostics of a human state. In
our opinion, the LOO error, as a measure of determinism and complexity, is a concept
that has potential application to a wide variety of physiological and clinical time-series
data.

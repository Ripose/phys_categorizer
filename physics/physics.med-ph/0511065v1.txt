Abstract

A detector using liquid Xenon in the scintillation mode is studied for Positron
Emission Tomography (PET). The speciﬁc design aims at taking full advantage of
the liquid Xenon properties. It does feature a promising insensitive to any parallax
eﬀect. This work reports on the performances of the ﬁrst LXe prototype module,
equipped with a position sensitive PMT operating in the VUV range (178 nm).

for various medical and biological applications, such as oncology, cardiology as
well as pharmacology. Experimental eﬀorts on a host of techniques have been
made in the ﬁeld of PET imaging, in particular towards the development of
new generation high resolution PET cameras dedicated to small animal imag-
ing [1,2,3]. A couple of years ago, we proposed to use liquid Xenon in an
axial geometry for a scintillation based PET [4,5,6]. This paper presents the
experimental results on the ﬁrst LXe prototype module, in terms of spatial
resolution in the axial and transaxial coordinates.

2 The geometry of the Liquid Xenon PET camera

The active part of this project of LXe camera is a ring featuring an internal
diameter of 8 cm and a radial extension of approximately 25 mm (see Fig.
1). It is ﬁlled with liquid Xenon and placed in a cryostat composed of thin
aluminum walls. Sixteen identical modules of the type shown on Fig. 2, are
immersed in this ring. Each module presents a 2 × 2 cm2 cross-section in the
transaxial plane of the camera. The axial ﬁeld of view is 5 cm. A module
is optically subdivided by one hundred 2 × 2 mm2 MgF2-coated aluminum
UV light guides. The UV light is collected on both sides of a module by
two Position Sensitive PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PSPMT). The (x,y) positions
measured by the photo-tubes determine which light guides have been ﬁred.
For each module, the axial coordinate is provided by the following ratio of the
photo-tube signals :

Z = (P MT1 − P MT2)/(P MT1 + P MT2)

allowing to measure the transaxial Depth Of Interaction (DOI) of the photons.

3 Experimental set-up

Following the layout displayed on Fig. 3, the Xenon is liqueﬁed in a ﬁrst
container called the compressor, then transferred to a container inside the
cryostat. The temperature inside the cryostat is kept around 165 K via a liq-
uid nitrogen heat exchanger. The temperature is constant to better than a
few tenths of a degree. The Xenon container is a stainless steel cylinder 50
mm long and 40 mm in diameter, closed at each end with a suprasil 3 mm
thick window. A 22Na source is mounted on a small carriage moving along
the z direction. A LYSO crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube completes
the experimental set-up to make the coincidence signal. The VUV photons
are then collected with one PSPMT at each end. PSPMT with the required

2

speciﬁcations, high Quantum Eﬃciency (QE) at 178 nm, and still working at
low temperatures (165 K), cannot be taken from the shelf yet. Hamamatsu
provided us with two prototype tubes, from the R8520-06-C12 series [7], hav-
ing ﬁve aluminum strips deposited on their window to improve the resistivity
of the photocathode at 165 K. QE was around 20% but the resistivity was
still rather high.

The read out electronics operates at room temperature and is composed
of standard NIM and CAMAC modules. The acquisition software performs
barycentre online calculation.

4 Experimental results

4.1 PSMPT spatial resolution and x and y localization

To evaluate the PSPMT spatial resolution, a deuterium light source is used to
produce a constant number of photons in a wide wavelength range. To level
down the number of photons emitted, dedicated light attenuators are placed
in front of the light source. Then to focus the light pulse on a speciﬁc area
deﬁned on the PSPMT surface, the light emitted by the source is collected
via an optical ﬁbre going through an opaque plastic disk placed in front of
the PSPMT window. This disk exhibits a matrix of holes equally spaced. The
number of photoelectrons is derived from the dynode signal distribution. The
x and y barycentre distributions is computed on-line by the DAQ and derived
of the anode signals. The resolution in x and y as a function of the number of
photoelectrons (Npe) is illustrated by Fig. 4. The resolution is increasing with
Npe, ranging from 0.32 mm down to 0.18 mm for Npe= 300. This experimental
study concludes that the PSPMT spatial resolution is ﬁne for our application.
The resolution is at the level of 1 mm in the x and y directions which is in
very good agreement with the simulation [8]. The second step of this analysis
was to study the light guide separation in the transaxial plane. It has been
evaluated using an 241Am α source located at one end of the Xenon container.
The advantage of using an a source in the liquid is to give intense point-like
sources of photons, at a well deﬁned distance of the PSPMT. Three diﬀerent
matrix of light guides were used for the tests, with cross sections of 2 × 2, 5 ×
5 and 2 × 5 mm2, within an overall cross section of 20 × 20 mm2. In the 2 × 5
conﬁguration, the module had therefore only 40 cells of 48 mm in length. The
walls of these cells are made of a double 35 µm thick aluminum foil, double
because specular reﬂection has been guarantied on one side only : the basic
material is a 35 µm aluminum foil, with a thin polyethylene ﬁlm glued on
one side to reduce the crookedness of its surface, followed with evaporation of

3

aluminum again and MgF2 to make the actual reﬂecting surface. The Fig. 5
obtained with a guide matrix of 2 × 5 mm2 shows a very satisfying light guides
separation in the (x,y) transverse plane.

4.2 Localization and resolution along the z axis

The speciﬁc design of the liquid Xenon PET prototype employs the Depth Of
Interaction (DOI) approach to solve the problem of parallax errors. It permits
a continuous measurement of the z coordinate. An experimental test bench
(see section 3 and Fig. 3) has been built to measure the module prototype
resolution in Z. The Z coordinate is deduced from the amplitude of the dynode
signals measured on the right and left PSPMT located at each side of the
module, as deﬁned in section 3.

The resolution at a z position will be given by the FWHM of the obtained dis-
tributions. The resolution as a function of the source localization is illustrated
by Fig. 6. The resolution is better at the module extremities rather than at
the central position where it is about 10 mm. This result is not as good as
expected but a reﬁned simulation of the light collection in optical guides has
been done and three conﬁguration for the light collection units (present setup
with the PSPMT, PSPMT immersed in the LXe, windowless APD immersed
in the LXe) have been compared [8], this analysis concludes that a higher
resolution can be achieved by :

• increasing the reﬂectivity of the light guide using other manufacturing pro-

cesses (the current value for the reﬂectivity is 0.78),

• immersing the PSPMT in the liquid or by using high quantum eﬃciency

Avalanche Photodiodes this is under way.

5 Conclusion

First test of a liquid Xenon TEP prototype module were carried out. The
preliminary results of the experimental study allow us to determine the in-
trinsic performance of this camera. The localization in the transaxial plane is
very satisfying : the resolution is better than 0.3 mm in the x and y direc-
tions. Eﬀorts are to be made for the localization in the axial direction since
the resolution in z is not only position dependent of the γ source used for
the test but exhibits a poor average value of about 8 mm. Simulation of the
light collection in optical guides and in various light collection units (PSPMT
at the LXe temperature but not immersed in the liquid, PSPMT immersed
in the LXe, windowless APD immersed in the LXe) concludes that a higher

4

resolution can be achieved [8]. Two next steps are foreseen. At ﬁrst, the light
guide reﬂectivity (currently 0.78) is to be improved, a new process is under
study. Then the VUV light collection on each module end would be better by
using high quantum eﬃciency windowless APD. We aim to investigate now
these two possibilities.

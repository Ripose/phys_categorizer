In this chapter we present a new approach to the study of manifestations of
chaos in real complex system. Recently we have achieved the following re-
sult. In real complex systems the informational measure of chaotic chatacter
(IMC) can serve as a reliable quantitative estimation of the state of a complex
system and help to estimate the deviation of this state from its normal con-
dition. As the IMC we suggest the statistical spectrum of the non-Markovity
parameter (NMP) and its frequency behavior. Our preliminary studies of real
complex systems in cardiology, neurophysiology and seismology have shown
that the NMP has diverse frequency dependence. It testiﬁes to the competi-
tion between Markovian and non-Markovian, random and regular processes
and makes a crossover from one relaxation scenario to the other possible. On
this basis we can formulate the new concept in the study of the manifesta-
tion of chaoticity. We suggest the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov
stochastic processes to calculate the NMP and the quantitative evaluation of
the IMC in real complex systems. With the help of the IMC we have found
out the evident manifestation of chaosity in a normal (healthy) state of the
studied system, its sharp reduction in the period of crises, catastrophes and
various human diseases. It means that one can appreciably improve the state
of a patient (of any system) by increasing the IMC of the studied live sys-
tem. The given observation creates a reliable basis for predicting crises and
catastrophes, as well as for diagnosing and treating various human diseases,
Parkinson’s disease in particular.

1 Introduction

Today the study of manifestations of chaos in real complex systems of di-
verse nature has acquired great importance. The analysis of some properties
and characteristics of real complex systems is impossible without quantita-
tive estimate of various manifestation of chaos. The dynamics or evolution
of the system can be predicted by the change of its chaoticity or regularity.
The discovery of the phenomenon of chaos in dynamic systems has changed
the attitude with regard to the functioning of complex systems, a human or-
ganism in particular. The chaos is the absence of regularity. It characterizes

176

the randomness and the unpredictability of the changes of the behavior of a
system. At the same time, the presence of chaos in dynamic systems does not
mean it cannot be taken under control. Instability of dynamic systems in the
state of chaos creates special sensitivity to both external and internal inﬂu-
ences and perturbations. The series of weak perturbations of the parameters
of the system allows to change its characteristics in the required direction.
”Chaos” is frequently understood as a determined dynamic chaos, that is,
the dynamics dependent on the initial conditions, parameters.

Lasers, liquid near to a threshold of turbulence, devices of nonlinear optics,
chemical reactions, accelerators of particles, classical multipartite systems,
some biological dynamic models are the examples of nonlinear systems with
the manifestation of determined chaos. Now manifestations of chaos are being
studied in diﬀerent spheres of human activity.

The control of the behavior of chaotic systems is one of the most important
problems. Most of the authors see two basic approaches to solve the problems
[1, 2]. Both directions envisage a preliminary choice of a certain perturbation.
The selected perturbation is used to exert inﬂuence on the chaotic system.
The ﬁrst direction relies on an internal perturbation, the choice of which is
based on the state of the system. The perturbation changes the parameter or
the set of parameters of the system, which results in the ordered behaviour of
the chaotic systems. The methods focusing on the choice of such parameters
(perturbations) are referred to as ”methods with a feedback” [1]-[6]. They
do not dependent on the studied chaotic system (model) as these parameters
can be selected by observing the system for some period of time. One also
considers that the methods with a delayed feedback [3, 7] belong to the ﬁrst
direction. The second approach presupposes that the choice of the external
perturbation does not dependent on the state of the chaotic system under
consideration. By aﬀecting the studied system with the similar perturbation,
it is possible to change its behaviour. The present group of methods is an
alternative to the ﬁrst one. These methods can be used in cases when internal
parameters depend on the environment [1, 8, 9].

Generally, when choosing internal (external) perturbations it is possible
to determine three basic stapes: the estimation of the initial information, the
choice of the perturbation and the bringing the chosen strategy of control
into action (its practical realization). At the ﬁrst stage the information on
the state of the studied system is collected. At the second stage the received
information is processed according to the plan or strategy of the control. On
the basis of the achieved results the decision on the choice of the internal
(of the external) perturbation is accepted. After that the chosen strategy of
chaos control is put into practice [2].

The initial idea of the present concept was to separate Markov (with
short-range time memory) and non-Markov (with long-range time memory)
stochastic processes. However, the study of real complex systems has revealed
additional possibilities of the given parameter. Actually, the non-Markovity

Manifestation of Chaos in Real Complex Systems

177

parameter represents a quantitative measure of chaoticity or regularity of
various states of the studied system. An increase of the given parameter
(ε1(0) ≫ 1) corresponds to an increase of the chaoticity of the state of the
system. A decrease of the non-Markovity parameter means a greater ordering
(regularity) of the state of the system. The given observation allows one to
deﬁne a new strategy for estimating of chaoticity in real systems. This new
approach in chaos theory can be presented as an alternative to the existing
methods. Further analysis of the non-Markovity parameter allows one to
deﬁne the degree of chaoticity or regularity of a state of the system.

In this work the new strategy for the study of manifestations of chaoticity
is applied to real complex systems. The possibilities of the new approach
are revealed at the analysis of the experimental data on various states of a
human organism with Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic
progressing disease of the brain observed in 1-2 % of elderly people. The given
disease was described in 1817 by James Parkinson in the book ”An essay
on the shaking palsy”. In 19th century the French neurologist Pierre Marie
Charcot called this disease ”Parkinson’s disease”. The steady progress of the
symptoms and yearly impairment of motor function is typical of Parkinson’s
disease. Complex biochemical processes characteristic of Parkinson’s disease
result in a lack of dopamine, a chemical substance which is carrier signals
from one nerve cell to another. The basic symptoms typical of Parkinson’s
disease form the so-called classical triad: tremor, rigidity of muscles (disorder
of speech, amimia), and depression (anxiety, irritability, apathy). The disease
steadily progresses and eventually the patient becomes a helpless invalid. The
existing therapy comprises a set of three basic treatments: medical treatment,
surgical treatment and electromagnetic stimulation of the aﬀected area of the
brain with the help of an electromagnetic stimulator. Today this disease is
considered practically incurable. The treatment of patients with Parkinson’s
disease requires an exact estimate of the current state of the person. The
oﬀered concept of research of manifestations of chaoticity allows one to track
down the least changes in the patient with the help of an exact quantitative
level of description.

Earlier we found out an opportunity for deﬁning the predisposition of a
person to the frustration of the central nervous system due to Parkinson’s
disease [13]. Our work is an expansion and development of the informational
possibilities of the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov random processes
and the search for parameters aﬀecting the health of a subject.

2 The statistical theory of discrete non-Markov random
processes. Non-Markovity parameter and its frequency
spectrum

The statistical theory of discrete non-Markov random processes [10]-[12]
forms a mathematical basis for our study of complex live systems. The the-

178

ory allows one to calculate the wide quantitative set of dynamic variables,
correlation functions and memory functions, power spectra, statistical non-
Markovity parameter, kinetic and relaxation parameters. The full intercon-
nected set of these variables, functions and parameters creates a quantitative
measure of chaoticity used for the description of processes, connected with
functioning of alive organism.

We use the non-Markovity parameter ε as a quantitative estimate of the
non-Markov properties of the statistical system. The non-Markovity param-
eter allows to statistical processes into Markov processes (ε → ∞), quasi-
Markov processes (ε > 1) and non-Markov processes (ε ∼1). Besides the
non-Markovity parameter we also use the spectrum of the non-Markovity
parameter. We deﬁne the spectrum as the set of all values of the physical pa-
rameter used for describing the state of a system or a process. Let’s consider
the ﬁrst and the nth kinetic equations of the chain of connected non-Markov
ﬁnite-diﬀerence kinetic equations [10, 11]:

elements of the splittable Liouville’s quasioperator, Π1 = Π, Π2 = P = 1−Π
and Π are projection operators.

Let’s deﬁne the relaxation times of the initial TCF and of the ﬁrst-order

memory functions as follows M1(t):

Then the spectrum of the non-Markovity parameter {ε} is deﬁned as an

{εi} = {ε1, ε2, ..., εn, ...},
ε1 = τa/τM1 , ε2 = τM1 /τM2, · · · , εn = τMn /τMn+1,
ε = τrel/τmem.

Note that a(t) = M0(t). The number εn characterizes the ratio of the re-
laxation times of the memory functions Mn and Mn+1. If for some n the
value of the parameter εn → ∞, then this relaxation level is Markovian. If εn
changes in limits from zero to a unit value, then the relaxation level is deﬁned
as non-Markovian. The times τrel (relaxation time) and τmem (memory life
time) appear when the eﬀects of the statistical memory in the complex dis-
crete system are taken into account by means of the Zwanzig’-Mori’s method
of kinetic equations. Thus, the non-Markovity parameter spectrum is deﬁned
by the stochastic properties of the TCF.

In [10] the concept of generalized non-Markovity parameter for a fre-

quency - dependent case was introduced:

3 The universal property of informational manifestation
of chaoticity in complex systems

In our work the discussion of manifestation of chaoticity is carried out on
the basis of a statistical invariant which includes a quantitative informational

180

measure of chaoticity and pathology in a covariant form. The existence of this
invariant is very important for the taking decisions in the problems related
to medicine as well as for analysing a wide area of physical problems related
to complex systems of various nature.

In each live organism there is a universal informational property of the

following form:

IM C + IM P = Invariant.

(7)

Here IMC is an informational (quantitative) measure of chaoticity for the
concrete live system, IMP is an informational measure of a pathological state
of a live organism. As an informational (quantitative) measure of the degree of
chaoticity (regularity) we propose to use the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity

1

o

parameter at zero frequency: ε1(0) =
. The physical sense of the pa-
rameter consists in comparison the relaxation scales of the time correlation
n
function (a(ω)) to the memory functions of the ﬁrst order (µ(ω)). Depend-
ing on the values of this parameter one can discriminate Markov processes
(with short-range memory) and non-Markov processes (with eﬀects long-
range memory). Thus, the phenomena distinguished by the greatest chaoticity
correspond to Markov processes. Non-Markov processes are connected with
greater regularity. The informational measure of a pathological state (IMP)
deﬁnes the qualitative state of a real live system.

The quantitative estimate IMC of the degree of the chaoticity of system
contains the information on a pathological state of the system. It testiﬁes
to the close interrelation of the given quantities. A high degree of chaoticity
is characteristic of a normal physiological state. In a pathological state the
degree of chaoticity decreases. A high degree of regularity is typical of this
condition. Thus, the quantitative estimate of chaoticity in live systems allows
one to deﬁne their physiological or pathological state with a high degree of
accuracy. In the right-hand side of (7) we have a statistical invariant, which
reveals the independence of the physical (as well as biophysical, biochemical
and biological) laws in the given live organism from the concrete situations
as well as the methods of description of these situations. The invariance, sub-
mitted in (7), is formulated as the generalization of the experimental data.
Among other physical laws the properties of invariance reﬂect the most gen-
eral and profound properties of the studied systems and characterize a wide
sphere of phenomena. Equation (7) reﬂects an informational observation. It
consists of two informational measures: the measure of chaoticity and the
measure of pathology (disease).

Let’s use the operator of transformation T (S′, S) in both parts of (7). It
realizes the transition of the system from one state S to other S′. By taking
into account the statistical invariance I(S′) = T (S′, S)I(S) = I(S) in the
right-hand side of (7) we get:

∆P = P (S

) − P (S) = −∆C = −{C(S

) − C(S)}, ∆P + ∆C = 0.

(8)

Manifestation of Chaos in Real Complex Systems

Here the following designations are introduced: I(S) = Invariant, P (S) =
IM P (S) is an informational measure of pathology (disease) for the state S,
C(S) = IM C(S) is an informational measure of chaoticity for the state of
patient S. Besides in (8) we take into account the rules of transformation:

C(S

Equations (7)-(9) are rather simple but they make the quantitative de-
scription of the state of a patient possible, both during the disease and under
the medical treatment. Equations (7)-(9) have a general character. They are
true for many complex natural and social systems. It is possible to develop
the algorithms of prediction of various demonstrations of chaos in complex
systems of diverse nature on the basis of these equations.

4 The quantitative factor of quality of a treatment

One of the major problems of the medical physics consists in the develop-
ment of a reliable criterion to estimate the quality of a medical treatment,
a diagnosis and a forecasting of the behaviour of real live complex systems.
As one can see from the previous section, such a criterion should include the
parameter of the degree of randomness in a live organism. The creation of
a quantitative factor for the quality of a treatment QT is based on the be-
haviour law of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(0) in the stochastic dynamics
of complex systems. The greater values of the parameter ε1(0) are character-
istic of stable physiological states of systems; the smaller ones are peculiar
for pathological states of live systems. Thus, by the increase or reduction
of the non-Markovity parameter one can judge the physiological state of a
live organism with a high degree of accuracy. Therefore the non-Markovity
parameter allows one to deﬁne the deviation of the physiological state of a
system from a normal state.

The factor QT deﬁnes the eﬃcacy or the quality of the treatment and is
directly connected with the changes in the quantitative measure of chaoticity
in a live organism. We shall calculate it in a concrete example. Let us consider
1 as the patient’s state before therapy, and 2 as the state of the patient after
certain medical intervention. Then ε1(1) and ε1(2) represent quantitative
measures of the chaoticity for the physiological states 1 and 2. The ratio δ
of these values (δ = ε1(2)
) will deﬁne eﬃcacy of the therapy. Various jth
ε1(1)
processes occur simultaneously in the therapy. Therefore the total value of δ
can be deﬁned by the following way:

δ =

εj

εj
1(1)

,

n

j=1
Y

(10)

182

Renat M. Yulmetyev, Sergey A. Demin, and Peter H¨anggi

where j = 1, 2...n is the number of factors aﬀecting the behaviour of the non-
Markovity parameter. However, the natural logarithm ln δ is more convenient
for use.

Then we have:

δ > 1, ln δ > 0;
δ = 1, ln δ = 0;

δ < 1, ln δ < 0.

The three values of δ mentioned above correspond to the three diﬀerent
situations of treatment: eﬀective, ineﬃcient and destructive treatment. They
reﬂect an increase, preservation and reduction of the measure of the chaoticity
in the therapy. Thus, one can deﬁne QT (ε) = ln δ according to (10) as follows:

QT (ε) = ln

n

εj
1(2)
εj
1(1)

.

j=1
Y
However, the total factor QT is deﬁned both by the quantitative measures
of the chaoticity and by other physiological and biochemical data. Now we
shall consider the transition of the patient from state 1 into state 2. Then
by analogy, one can introduce the physiological parameter k(1), determined
for state 1, and k(2) for state 2. In the case of Parkinson’s disease one can
introduce the amplitude or the dispersion of the tremor velocity of some
extremities (hand or leg) of the patient as this parameter. In other cases any
medical data, which is considered for diagnostic purposes, can be used. For
greater reliability it is necessary to use the combination of various parameters
kj(1) and (kj(2)).

will be considered as a generalized quantitative factor of quality of the ther-
apy.

However in real conditions it is necessary to increase or weaken the mag-
nitude of chaotic, or physiological contributions to (12). For this purpose we
shall take the simple ratio:

ln

(anbm...) = n ln a + m ln b + ...

(13)

By analogy, we can reinforce or weaken various contributions depending on
the concrete situation:

183

If incomplete experimental data are available in some situations, one can
assume pj = 1 (attenuation of the physiological contribution). A value of
mj > 1 can mean an ampliﬁcation of the chaotic contribution. Otherwise, if
we want to weaken the chaotic contribution, we should take (mj = 1) and if
we want to reinforce the physiological contribution we come towards (pj > 1).
We have presented the results of the calculation of the quantitative factor QT
below in Sect. 6.

5 Experimental data

We have taken the experimental data from [15]. They represent the time
records of the tremor velocity of the index ﬁnger of a patients with Parkinson’s
disease (see, also http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/). The eﬀect of
chronic high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) on the rest tremor was
investigated [15] in a group of subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) (16 sub-
jects). Eight PD subjects with high amplitude tremor and eight PD subjects
with low amplitude tremor were examined by a clinical neurologist and tested
with a velocity laser to quantify time and frequency domain characteristics of
tremor. The participants received DBS of the internal globus pallidus (GPi),
the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the ventrointermediate nucleus of the tha-
lamus (Vim). Tremor was recorded with a velocity laser under two conditions
of DBS (on-oﬀ) and two conditions of medication (L-Dopa on-oﬀ).

All the subjects gave informed consent and institutional ethics procedures
were followed. The selected subjects were asked to refrain from taking their
medication at least 12 h before the beginning of the tests and were not allowed
to have more than one coﬀee at breakfast on the two testing days. Rest
tremor was recorded on the most aﬀected side with a velocity-transducing
laser [16, 17]. This laser is a safe helium-neon laser. The laser was placed
at about 30 cm from the index ﬁnger tip and the laser beam was directed
perpendicular to a piece of reﬂective tape placed on the ﬁnger tip. Positive
velocity was recorded when the subjects extended the ﬁnger and negative
velocity when the subjects ﬂexed the ﬁnger.

The conditions, counterbalanced across subjects, included the following:
1. The L-Dopa condition (no stimulation).
2. The DBS condition (stimulation only).
3. The ”oﬀ” condition (no medication and no stimulation).
4. The ”on” condition (on medication and on stimulation).
5. The eﬀect of stopping DBS on tremor (time record of the tremor after

15, 30, 45, 60 min since switching oﬀ of the stimulator).

In Fig. 1 the time records of the velocity of changing tremor of the index
ﬁnger of the second patient’s hand (man, 52 years old) under various condi-
tions of inﬂuence on the organism are submitted as an example. High velocity
of tremor is observed: 1) in a natural condition of the patient (a), 2) 15 (45)
minutes after the stimulator was switched oﬀ. Lower tremor speed occurs:

1) when both methods (stimulation, medication) are used, 2) when each of
these methods is used separately, 3) 30 (60) minutes after the stimulator was
switched oﬀ. Similar results are presented in [15].

6 Results

In this section the results obtained by processing the experimental data for
one of the patients (subject number 2) are shown. Similar or related pictures
are observed in the experimental data of other subjects.

6.1 The non-Markovity parameter as a quantitative measure of
deﬁning chaoticity

In this subsection the technique to calculate quantitative and qualitative
criteria under various conditions inﬂuencing the state of a patient is given.
The basic idea of the approach consists in deﬁning the quantitative ratio
between chaoticity and regularity of the observed process. It allows one to
judge the physiological (pathological) state of a live system by the degree of

Manifestation of Chaos in Real Complex Systems

185

chaoticity or of regularity. The highest degree of chaoticity in the behaviour
of a live system corresponds to a normal physiological state. Higher degree of
regularity or speciﬁc ordering is characteristic of various pathological states
of a live system. In the given work we use the non-Markovity parameter
ε1(0) as a special quantitative measure deﬁning chaoticity or regularity of the
studied process. The examples [10]-[14], [18] which have been investigated by
us earlier serve as a basis for such reasoning. As one of the examples we shall
consider the tremor velocity of the changing of the subject’s index ﬁngers in
the case of Parkinson’s disease.

The comparative analysis of the initial time record and the non-Markovity
parameter for all the submitted experimental data allows one to discover
the following regularity. The value of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(0)
decreases with the increase of the tremor velocity of the patient’s ﬁngers
(deterioration of the physiological state) and grows with the decrease of the
tremor velocity (improvement of the state of the patient). We shall also con-
sider the power spectra µ0(ω) of the initial TCF under various conditions
inﬂuencing an organism, the window-time behaviour of the power spectrum
µ0(ω) and the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ω), the time dependence local
averaging relaxation parameter λ1(t) as additional sources of information.

Figure 2 represents the power spectra of the initial TCF for various ex-
perimental conditions. One can observe the powerful peak in all the ﬁgures at
the characteristic frequency ω = 0.07f.u.(ω = 2πν, 1f.u. = 2π/τ, 1τ = 10−2
second). The amplitude values of this peak for µi(ω) (i = 1, 2, 3) are given in

A similar picture is observed in patients with myocardial infarction [11]. The

the initial record of time.

In Table 1 the second patient’s amplitude values µ0(ω) for the initial TCF
and the memory functions of junior orders µi(ω) (i = 1, 2, 3) at the frequency
ω = 0.07f.u. are submitted. The terms of the ﬁrst row deﬁne the conditions
under which the experiment is carried out. Under all conditions a power peak
at the frequency ω = 0.07f.u. can be observed. The amplitude values of the
given peak (in particular in the power spectrum µ0(ω)) reﬂect the amplitude
of the tremor velocity. For example, the least amplitude 75 τ 2 corresponds
to the condition (ON, ON; or: deep brain stimulation on, medication on).

of tremor of subject number 2 under various conditions that inﬂuence an organ-
ism. (a) deep brain stimulation on, medication on; (b) deep brain stimulation on,

ulation oﬀ, medication oﬀ; (e)-(h) the power spectrum µ0(ω) of the initial TCF
for the recording of rest tremor in the right index ﬁnger of the subject 15 (30, 45,
60) minutes after the stimulator was switched oﬀ, medication oﬀ. At the frequency
ω = 0.07f.u., 1f.u. = 100Hz (the characteristic frequency), a peak is found. The
presence and amplitude of this peak are determined by the state of the patient

The highest amplitude 4.34 ∗ 104τ 2 corresponds to the greatest tremor speed
(see Figs. 1e, 2e). Thus, the given parameter can be used to estimate the
physiological state of a patient. A similar picture is observed in all other
patients.

In Fig. 3 the initial time record (the normal state of the subject; OFF,
OFF) and the window-time behaviour of the power spectrum of the TCF
(the technique of the analysis of the given behaviour is considered in Ref.
[18]) are submitted. In these ﬁgures regions 1, 2, 3, which correspond to the
least values of the tremor velocity are shown. The minimal amplitude of the
peaks of the power spectrum µ0(ω) corresponds to the regions with the least
tremor velocity.

In Fig. 4 the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity
parameter ε1(ω) is submitted for the second subject under various experi-
mental conditions. The value of the parameter ε1(0) at zero frequency is of
special importance for our study of manifestations of chaoticity. It is possi-
ble to judge the change of the state of a subject by the increase (or by the
decrease) of this value. The comparative analysis of the initial time records
allows one to come to the similar conclusions. In Figs. 4d-h a well-deﬁned fre-
quency structure of the non-Markovity parameter can be seen. The structure
is completely suppressed and disappears only when during the treatment.

1.0043 in the last one) deﬁne chaoticity or the regularity of the studied states. The
amplitudes of these values also characterize the state of the subject

The characteristic frequency of the ﬂuctuations corresponds approximately
to ω = 0.06f.u. These multiple peaks are the most appreciable at low frequen-
cies. At higher frequencies these ﬂuctuations are smoothed out. As can be
seen in these ﬁgures, the 2nd subject has a strong peak which remains stable
over time. As our data show, the comb-like structure with multiple frequen-
cies can be observed in all patients with high tremor velocity. In a group of
patients with low tremor velocity it disappears, and a wider spectrum that
presents some ﬂuctuations over time is observed. The present structure tes-
tiﬁes to the presence of characteristic frequency of ﬂuctuations of tremor of
human extremities.

In Table 2 the dispersion interval of the values and the average value ε1(0)
for the whole group of subjects (16 subjects) are submitted. Let us consider 2
conditions: OFF, OFF and OFF, ON. In the ﬁrst case the dispersion interval
and the average value ε1(0) are minimal. It means the presence of a high
degree of regularity of the physiological state of the patient. The degree of
regularity is appreciably reduced when applying any method of treatment.
Here the degree of chaoticity grows. The maximal degree of chaoticity corre-
sponds to the condition OFF, ON (medication is used only). The diﬀerence
in ε1(0)av.val with medication and without it (OFF, OFF) is 3.8 times (!). On
the basis of the comparative analysis of the given parameters the best method
of treatment for each individual case can be found. It is necessary to note,
that the given reasoning is true only for the study of the chaotic component
of the quantitative factor of the quality of treatment QT . The most trust-
worthy information about the quality of treatment can be given by the full
quantitative factor QT which takes into account of other diagnostic factors.

The results of the calculation of the quantitative factor QT are shown in
Table 3. The data are submitted for a single patient and for the whole group.
Here QT (ε) is the chaotic contribution to the quantitative factor (see (11)).
QT is the total quantitative factor (see (14)), where ε(1)(1) and ε(1)(2) are the
chaotic contributions for the tremor amplitudes k(1)(1), k(1)(2); ε(2)(1) and
ε(2)(2) are the dispersions of the tremor amplitudes k(2)(1), k(2)(2) (physio-
logical contributions). The full factor QT provides detailed information about
the quality of the treatment. The present factor includes both the chaotic
component QT (ε), and the physiological contribution QT (k). The calcula-
tion QT (k) is described in Sect. 4. One can deﬁne the quality of a treatment
by means of QT . The positive value of the given factor deﬁnes an eﬀective

treatment. For a separate patient and for the whole group, QT reaches its
maximal value under the condition ON, ON. The total quantitative factor
is supplemented by a diagnostic (physiological) component. It allows one to
take into account those features of the system which the chaotic component
does not contain. For the second patient under condition 15 OFF (see Table
3) the factor QT has a negative value. It testiﬁes to the negative inﬂuence of
the given treatment on the organism of the patient. The best treatment is
thus the combination of the two medical methods: electromagnetic stimula-
tion and medication.

Figure 5 reﬂects the behaviour of the parameter ε1(0) for four diﬀerent
patients. The points lying above the horizontal line testify to an improvement
of the state of the subject and the eﬃcacy of the treatment. The points, lying
below the horizontal line testify to a deterioration of the state of the subject
and the ineﬃciency of the applied method. For example, Fig. 5b corresponds
to the sevenfold change of the quantitative measure of chaoticity for the 9th
patient. In case of the 8th patient (see Fig. 5c) no inﬂuence could change the
measure of the chaoticity. Therefore there was practically no change in the
state of the subject either. In some cases (see Figs. 5b, 5d) the DBS or the
medication reduces the measure of chaoticity which testiﬁes to a deterioration
of the state of the subject. This approach allows one to deﬁne the most
eﬀective (or ineﬃcient) treatment in each individual case.

6.2 The deﬁnition of a predictor of sudden changes of the tremor
velocity

In this subsection the window-time behaviour of the non-Markovity param-
eter ε1(ω) for a certain case (the second patient, two methods of medical
treatment were used) and the procedure of local averaging of the relaxation
parameters are considered. These procedures allow one to determine speciﬁc
predictors of the change of regimes in the initial time records.

The idea of the ﬁrst procedure is, that the optimum length of the time
window (28 = 256 points) is found ﬁrst. In the studied dependence (in our
case the frequency dependence of the ﬁrst point of the non-Markovity pa-
rameter) the ﬁrst window is cut out. Then the second window is cut out

Fig. 5. The behavior of the parameter ε1(0) for four various patients: (a) the
second subject, high amplitude tremor, (b) the 9th subject, low amplitude tremor
(the stimulation of the GPi); (c) the 8th subject, high amplitude tremor, (d) the
15th subject, low amplitude tremor (the stimulation of the STN). The value of ε1(0)
for seven consecutive conditions of the experiment: 1 - both methods are used; 2
- treatment by medication is applied only; 3 - the DBS is used only; 4 (5, 6, 7) -
value of the parameter 15 (30, 45, 60) minutes after the stimulator was switched
oﬀ; the horizontal line corresponds to the value of the parameter when no method
is used. This representation allows one to deﬁne the most eﬀective treatment for
each patient

(from point 257 points to point 512), etc. This construction allows one to
ﬁnd the local time behaviour of the non-Markovity parameter. At the critical
moments when the tremor velocity increases the value of the non-Markovity
parameter comes nearer to a unit value. One can observe that the value of
the non-Markovity parameter starts to decrease 2-2.5 sec before the increase
of the tremor velocity (see Fig. 6).

The idea behind the second procedure is the following: one can consider
the initial data set and take an N -long sampling. We can calculate kinetic
and relaxation parameters for the given sampling. Then we can carry out a
”step-by-step shift to the right”. Then we calculate kinetic and relaxation
parameters. After that we execute one more ”step-by-step shift to the right”
and continue the procedure up to the end of the time series. Thus, the local
averaged parameters have a high sensitivity to the eﬀects of intermittency
and non-stationarity. Any non-regularity in the initial time series is instantly
reﬂected in the behaviour of the local average parameters. The optimal length
of the sample is 120 points. In Figs. 7, 8 the initial time record and the time
dependence of the local relaxation parameter λ1(t) are shown in two cases.
The change in the time behaviour of the parameter λ1(t) begins 2-3s prior
to the change of the regimes of the time record of the tremor velocity. The

7 Conclusions

In this chapter we have proposed a new concept for the study of man-
ifestations of chaoticity. It is based on the application of the statistical
non-Markovity parameter and its spectrum as an informational measure of
chaoticity. This approach allows one to deﬁne the diﬀerence between a healthy
person and a patient by means of the numerical value of the non-Markovity
parameter. This observation gives a reliable tool for the strict quantitative
estimates that are necessary for the diagnosis and the quantiﬁcation of the
treatment of patients. As an example we have considered the changes of
various dynamic conditions of patients with Parkinson’s disease. The quanti-
tative and qualitative criteria used by us for the deﬁnition of chaoticity and
regularity of investigated processes in live systems reveal new informational
opportunities of the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov random pro-
cesses. The new concept allows one to estimate quantitatively the eﬃcacy and
the quality of the treatment of diﬀerent patients with Parkinson’s disease. It

Manifestation of Chaos in Real Complex Systems

193

allows one to investigate various dynamic states of complex systems in real
time.

The statistical non-Markovity parameter ε1(0) can serve as a reliable
quantitative informational measure of chaoticity. It allows one to use ε1(0) for
the study of the behaviour of diﬀerent chaotic systems. In the case of Parkin-
son’s disease the change of the parameter deﬁnes the change of a quantitative
measure of chaosity or regularity of a physiological system. The increase of
chaoticity reﬂects the decrease of the quantitative measure of pathology and
the improvement of the state of the patient. The increase of the regularity de-
ﬁnes high degree of manifestation of pathological states of live systems. The
combined power spectra of the initial TCF µ0(ω), the three memory func-
tions of junior orders and the frequency dependence of the non-Markovity
parameter compose an informational measure which deﬁnes the degree of
pathological changes in a human organism.

The new procedures (the window-time procedure and the local averaging
procedure) give evident predictors of the change of the initial time signal.
The window-time behaviour of the non-Markovity parameter ε1(ω) reﬂects
the increase of the tremor velocity 2-2.5s earlier. It happens when the non-
Markovity parameter approaches a unit value. The procedure of local av-
eraging of the relaxation parameter λ1(t) reﬂects the relaxation changes of
physiological processes in a live system. The behaviour of the local parameter
λ1(t) reacts to a sudden change of relaxation regimes in the initial time record
2-3s earlier. These predictors allow to lower the probability of ineﬀective use
of diﬀerent methods of treatment.

In the course of the study we have come to the following conclusions:
- The application of medication for the given group of patients proved to be
the most eﬃcient way to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease. Used sepa-
rately stimulation is less eﬀective than the the use of medication.
- The combination of diﬀerent methods (medication plus electromagnetic
stimulator) is less eﬀective than the application of medication or of stimula-
tion. In some cases the combination of medication and stimulation exerts a
negative inﬂuence on the state of the subject.
- After the stimulator is switched oﬀ its aftereﬀect has an oscillatory charac-
ter with a low characteristic frequency corresponding to a period of 30 min.
- The eﬃcacy of various medical procedures and the quality of a treatment
can be estimated quantitatively for each subject separately with utmost pre-
cision.
- However, if we take both chaotic and physiological components
into account, the general estimation of the quality of treatment
will be more universal. The combination of two methods (DBS
and medication, QT = 4.071) produces the most eﬀective result in
comparison with the eﬀect of DBS (3.661) or of medication (2.883)
given separately. This is connected with additional aspect of the es-
timation of the quality of treatment due to the study both of both

194

chaotic and diagnostic components of a live system. This conclusion
corresponds to the results of [15].

In conclusion we would like to state that our study gives a unique op-
portunity for the exact quantitative description of the states of patients with
Parkinson’s disease at various stages of the disease as well as of the treat-
ment and the recovery of the patient. On the whole, the proposed concept of
manifestations of chaoticity opens up great opportunities for the alternative
analysis, diagnosis and forecasting of the chaotic behavior of real complex
system of live nature.

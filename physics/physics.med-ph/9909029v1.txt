We study the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) using scale speciﬁc variance and scaling exponents as
measures of healthy and cardiac impaired individuals. Our results show that the variance and the
scaling exponent are highly uncorrelated. We ﬁnd that the variance measure at certain scales are well
suited to separate healthy subjects from heart patients. However, for cumulative survival probability
the scaling exponents outperform the variance measure. Our risk study is based on a database
containing recordings from 428 MI individuals (after myocardial infarct) and on database containing
105 healthy subjects and 11 heart patients. The results have been obtained by applying three
recently developed methods (DFA - Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, WAV - Multiresolution Wavelet
Analysis, and DTS - Detrended Time Series analysis) which are found to be highly correlated.

The study of heart rate variability (HRV) has been in
use for the last two decades as part of clinical, prognostic
work; international guidelines for evaluating conventional
HRV-parameters do exist [1]. The conventional param-
eters are power spectra [2] and standard deviation [3].
Recently three new methods of analyzing RR time-series
have been developed, all of them showing signs of im-
proved prognostic performance. The three methods are:
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [4–6], Multires-
olution Wavelet Analysis (WAV) [7–11] and Detrended
Time Series Analysis (DTS) [12]. The question which
method and which measure yield better separation be-
tween cardiac impaired and healthy subjects has beeen
highly controversially discussed [8,13].

In this Letter we show that while for separating be-
tween healthy subjects and heart patients the scale spe-
ciﬁc measure, the variance, is well suited; for the MI (my-
ocardial infarct) group the scale independent measure,
i.e., the scaling exponent, serves as a better risk indica-
tor. Moreover, we show that the three above mentioned
methods for both variance and scaling exponent, are cor-
related and converge to similar results while the variance
and the scaling exponent are highly uncorrelated.

In our study we use two groups, the MI group, contain-
ing 428 heart patients after MI and a control group, con-
sisting 105 healthy individuals and 12 cardiac impaired
patients. These groups are much larger than any of the
groups used in the above cited studies. We applied the
following methods.

The DFA Method. The detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
was proposed by Peng et al [4]. This method avoids spuri-

ous detection of correlations that are artifacts of nonsta-
tionarity. The interbeat interval time series is integrated
and then divided into windows of equal length, n. In each
window the data is ﬁtted with a least square straight line
which represents the local trend in that window. The in-
tegrated time series is detrended by subtracting the local
trend in each window. The root mean square ﬂuctuation,
the variance σdfa(n) of the integrated and detrended time
series is calculated for diﬀerent scales (window sizes); the
variance can be characterized by a scaling exponent αdfa,
deﬁned as σ(n) ∼ nα.

The WAV Method. In the WAV method [7–9] one ﬁnds
the wavelet coeﬃcients Wm,j, where m is a ‘scale pa-
rameter’ and j is a ‘position’ parameter, by means of
a wavelet transform. The standard deviation σwav(m)
of the wavelet coeﬃcients Wm,j across the parameter j
is used as a separation parameter. Further, in [14] the
procedure was slightly extended by introducing a ﬁlter-
ing process consisting of calculating the inverse wavelet
transform based on the wavelet coeﬃcients, with the re-
moval of irrelevant scale coeﬃcients. The subsequent
standard deviation of the inversely tranformed time se-
ries, σﬁlter, results in a considerable improvement in the
separation of the group of healthy subjects from the
group of patients. The corresponding scaling exponents
are denoted by αwav and αﬁlter.

The DTS Method. The detrended time series method
was suggested in [12]. In this method one detrends the
RR time series by substracting the local average in a
running window from the original time series, resulting in
a locally detrended time series. The standard deviation

σdts is calculated for various window scales with a scaling
exponent αdts.

FIG. 1. A comparison between diﬀerent HRV methods
(DFA, WAV, and DTS). 105 healthy subjects are indicated
by circles while 11 heart patients are marked by squares. The
scale speciﬁc variances σdts and σwav separate the two groups,
while the scaling exponent αdfa, fails to do so.

The ﬁrst suggestion to use a scale independent mea-
sure of the HRV as a separation parameter was by Peng
et al [4] who found that a critical value of the DFA scaling
exponent could distinguish between healthy individuals
and heart patients. Thurner et al [9] used, however, the
scale speciﬁc WAV variance in order to successfully sepa-
rate the two groups. This results was independently con-
ﬁrmed on diﬀerent groups in Ref. [14]. Nevertheless, the
controversy was maintained in two recent Letters [8,13],
which claimed that one measure outperforms the other
one.

In Fig. 1 we compare the conventional measures for
HRV for the control group: the variance for the DTS and
WAV method (σdts and σwav) and the scaling exponent
for the DFA method (αdfa). One notes that the scale
dependent σ-measure yields a nearly perfect separation
of cardiac impaired subjects (denoted by ✷) from healthy
subjects (denoted by ◦), whereas this is deﬁnitely not the
case for the scale-independent measure αdfa [15].

FIG. 2. Cumulative survival probabilty curves using the
WAV method. The entire group of 328 individuals is divided
into two groups according to a critical value σc or αc. (a)
σc = −4, (b) αc = 0.65, (c) σc = −5.5, and (d) αc = 0.15,

This outcome is reversed when we applied the mea-
sures on the MI group. Since we have no diagnostics
on this group, but rather do know the follow-up history
for 328 individuals, we investigated the survival prob-
abilty of this group as expressed in the so-called sur-
vival curve. In these curves one divides the entire group
by means of a speciﬁc value of the σ or α measure,
called the critical value σc or αc. For each subgroup
we calculate the cumulative survival probabilty given by
P (t + ∆t) = P (t)[1 − ∆N/N (t)], where P (t) is the prob-
abilty to survive up to t days after the ECG recording,
N (t) denotes the number of individuals alive at t days
after the examination and ∆N denotes the number of
individuals who died during the time interval ∆t. Fig. 2
shows a comparison of survival curves where the separat-
ing measure in ﬁgures (a) and (c) is the critical variance
σc and in ﬁgures (b) and (d) the critical scaling exponent
αc. Individuals with σ > σc (or α > αc) belong to the
subgroup with the higher survival probabilty; the upper
panel extracts the subgroup with a high survival proba-
bilty, whereas the lower panel extracts the subgroup with
a low survival probabilty. From this comparison it is ob-
vious that the scaling exponent serves as a better prog-
nostic predictor.

In Fig. 2 we used the measures of the WAV method;
but as we shall show below all above discussed methods
are well correlated and no signiﬁcant diﬀerence is noti-
cable in the survival curves when using DFA and DTS
measures.

to die is plotted versus the average value of σ and α for each
subgroup. The vertical solid lines indicate the critical values
σc used in Fig. 2 (a) and (c) while the vertical dashed lines
indicate the critical values αc used in Fig. 2 (b) and (d).

The inferiority of the variance is also conﬁrmed by Fig.
3, which shows the total number of deaths normalized
by the total population. The greater sensitivity of the
α dependent curve is expressed by the larger negative
slope.

In order to investigate how the various methods are
correlated we applied them to the larger MI group. The
top panel of Fig. 4 shows that the variances of the three
methods are well correlated, which is also true for the
scaling exponents (middle panel). These comparisons in-
dicate that indeed the various methods yield the same re-
sults in terms of variance and scaling exponents. On the
other hand, the lower panel of Fig. 4 shows that the scale
speciﬁc variance and the scale independent scaling expo-
nent measures are uncorrelated for the DTS and DFA and
are only faintly correlated for the WAV method. From
this we conclude that the α and σ measures characterize
the interbeat interval series in diﬀerent ways; the vari-
ance is a measure in the time domain (and thus is almost
invariant to shuﬀeling [9]), while the scaling exponent
depends on the order of events and thus is a measure in
the frequency domain (e.g., αdfa = 1
2 for white noise and
equals 1 for 1/f noise).

FIG. 4. A comparison between diﬀerent HRV methods
using 428 individuals. Upper panel - σ measure versus σ
measure; middle panel - α measure versus α measure; lower
panel - σ measure versus α measure. The σdfa and σwav is cal-
culated at m = 4, σdts at m = 8; αdfa and αwav is calculated
for m = 1 to 4, αdts for m = 1 to 8.

From this we conjecture that the variance reﬂects
changes in either the sympathetic or the parasympathetic
activities which are aﬀected by changes in the cardiac in-
otropic state; thus the variance may hint on the instant
condition of the physical properties of the heart. From
the above we also conjecture that the scaling exponent
depends on the interplay of the two contradicting parts of
the autonomic nervous system and is thus an expression
of the underlying mechanism of heart regulation (which
inﬂuences the conventional power spectrum [2]) [16].

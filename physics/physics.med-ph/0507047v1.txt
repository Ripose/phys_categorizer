We report the ﬁrst experimental test of an analytic image reconstruction algorithm for optical
tomography with large data sets. Using a continuous-wave optical tomography system with 108
source-detector pairs, we demonstrate the reconstruction of an absorption image of a phantom
consisting of a highly-scattering medium with absorbing inhomogeneities.

Optical tomography (OT) is a biomedical

imaging
modality that utilizes diﬀuse light as a probe of tissue
structure and function[1]. Clinical applications include
imaging of breast disease and functional neuroimaging.
The physical problem that is considered is to reconstruct
the optical properties of an inhomogenous medium from
measurements taken on its surface. In a typical experi-
ment, optical ﬁbers are used for illumination and detec-
tion of the transmitted light [2, 3, 4]. The number of
measurements (source-detector pairs) which can be ob-
tained, in practice, varies between 102 − 104. A recently
proposed alternative to ﬁber-based experiments is to em-
ploy a narrow incident beam for illumination. The beam
can be scanned over the surface of the medium while a
lens-coupled CCD detects the transmitted light. Using
such a “noncontact” method, it is possible to avoid many
of the technical diﬃculties which arise due to ﬁber-sample
interactions [5, 6, 7, 8]. In addition, extremely large data
sets of approximately 108 − 1010 measurements can read-
ily be obtained. Data sets of this size have the potential
to vastly improve the quality of reconstructed images in
OT.

The reconstruction of images from large data sets is
an extremely challenging problem due to the high com-
putational complexity of numerical approaches to the in-
verse problem in OT. To address this challenge, we have
developed analytic methods to solve the inverse prob-
lem [9, 11, 12]. These methods lead to a dramatic reduc-
tion in computational complexity and have been applied
in numerical simulations to data sets as large as 1010 mea-
surements [11]. In this Letter, we report the ﬁrst experi-
mental test of an analytic image reconstruction method.
By employing a noncontact OT system with 108 source-
detector pairs, we reconstruct the optical absorption of a
highly-scattering medium. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of image reconstruction for OT with large data
sets.

We begin by considering the propagation of diﬀuse
light. The density of electromagnetic energy u(r) in an
absorbing medium obeys the diﬀusion equation

− D∇2u(r) + α(r)u(r) = S(r) ,

(1)

where α(r) is the absorption coeﬃcient, S(r) is the power
density of a continuous wave source, and D is the diﬀu-

sion constant. The energy density also obeys the bound-
ary condition u + ℓˆn · ∇u = 0 on the surface bounding
the medium, where ˆn is the unit outward normal and ℓ
is the extrapolation length [10]. The relative intensity
measured by a point detector at r2 due to a point source
at r1 is given, within the accuracy of the ﬁrst Rytov ap-
proximation, by the integral equation

φ(r1, r2) =

d3rG(r1, r)G(r, r2)δα(r) ,

(2)

Z

where the source and detector are oriented in the in-
ward and outward normal directions, respectively [12].
Here δα(r) = α(r) − α0 denotes the spatial ﬂuctua-
tions in α(r) relative to a reference medium with ab-
sorption α0, G is the Green’s function for Eq. (1) with
α = α0, and the data function φ is deﬁned by φ(r1, r2) =
−G(r1, r2) ln(I(r1, r2)/I0(r1, r2)), where I(r1, r2) de-
notes the intensity in the medium and I0(r1, r2) is the
intensity in the reference medium. Note that the inten-
sity is related to the Green’s function by the expression

I(r1, r2) =

G(r1, r2) ,

We have constructed a noncontact OT system to
test
image reconstruction.
A schematic of the instrument is shown in Fig. 1.
The source is a continuous-wave stabilized diode laser
(DL7140-201, Thorlabs) operating at a wavelength of 785
nm with an output power of 70 mW. The laser output
is divided into two beams by a beam splitter. The re-
ﬂected beam is incident on a power meter which moni-
tors the stability of the laser intensity. The transmitted
beam passes through a lens onto a pair of galvanometer-
controlled mirrors (SCA 750, Lasesys). The mirrors are
used to scan the beam, which has a focal spot size of
200 µm, in a raster fashion over the surface of the sam-
ple. After propagating through the sample, the trans-
mitted light passes through a band-pass interference ﬁlter
(10LF20-780, Newport) and is imaged onto a front illumi-
nated thermoelectric-cooled 16-bit CCD array (DV435,

Andor Technology) using a 23 mm/f 1.4 lens. A mechan-
ical shutter is placed in front of the CCD to reduce arti-
facts associated with frame transfer within the CCD chip.
A pulse generator with digital delay is used to trigger and
synchronize the CCD, the shutter and the position of the
beam.

system.

The sample chamber is a rectangular box of depth 5
cm with square faces of area 50 × 50 cm2 constructed of
clear acrylic sheets. The beam is scanned on one face of
the sample and the opposite face is imaged by the CCD.
The chamber is placed equidistantly from the CCD and
the laser source along the optical axis at a distance of
110 cm. The chamber is ﬁlled with a scattering medium
which consists of a suspension of 1% Intralipid in water
in which absorbing objects may be suspended.

A tomographic data set is acquired by raster scanning
the beam over a 29 × 29 square lattice with a lattice
spacing of 0.5 cm. This yields 841 source positions within
a 14 × 14 cm2 area centered on the optical axis. For each
source, a 429×429 pixel region of interest is read out from
the CCD. This results in 184,041 detectors arranged in a
square lattice with an eﬀective lattice spacing equivalent
to 0.065 cm and all detectors located within a 28 × 28
cm2 area centered on the optical axis. Thus a data set
of 1.5 × 108 source-detector pairs is acquired.

The inverse problem in OT consists of reconstructing
δα from measurements of φ. In this Letter, we consider
the inversion of the integral equation (2) in the slab mea-
surement geometry. The approach taken is to construct
the singular value decomposition of the integral operator
whose kernel is deﬁned by (2) and to use this result to
obtain the pseudoinverse solution to (2).

The starting point for this development is to consider
the lattice Fourier transform of the sampled data function
which is deﬁned by

φ(q1, q2) =

exp [i(q1 · r1 + q2 · r2)] φ(r1, r2) ,

(4)

where the sum is carried out over the square lattices of
sources and detectors with lattice spacings h1 and h2, re-
spectively. The wave vectors q1 and q2 belong to the

2

ﬁrst Brillouin zones of the corresponding lattices, de-
noted FBZ(h1) and FBZ(h2). It can then be shown that
the pseudoinverse solution to the integral equation (2) is
given by the inversion formula

where the kernel K is deﬁned in Ref. [12]. Several aspects
of Eq. (5) are important to note. First, the transverse
spatial resolution of reconstructed images is determined
by the spatial frequency of sampling of the data function
with respect to both source and detector coordinates. As
a consequence, a large number of source-detector pairs is
required to achieve the highest possible spatial resolution.
It can be seen that when the source and detector lattices
have equal spacing, the theoretical limit of transverse res-
olution is given by the lattice spacing. When the source
and detector lattice spacings are diﬀerent, as is the case
in the experiment reported here (where h1 = 0.5 cm and
h2 = 0.065 cm), the resolution of reconstructed images is
controlled by the larger lattice spacing (lower spatial fre-
quency). Second, the inverse problem in OT is evidently
overdetermined. In addition, it is highly ill-posed. As a
result, it can be said that large data sets allow for averag-
ing the data function in such a way that the sensitivity to
noise in the inverse problem is partially ameliorated. Fi-
nally, numerical implementation of (5) requires replacing
the integrals over d2q and d2p by sums over a ﬁnite set
of wavevectors. In practice, we ﬁnd that integration over
d2q can be carried out with a step size ∆q = 0.07 cm−1
and 14,641 integration points while the integration over
d2p requires a step size ∆p = 1/2∆q and 1,296 integra-
tion points. Thus a total of 1.9 × 107 Fourier components
of the data are used in the reconstruction.

The ﬁrst step in the reconstruction of tomographic im-
ages is to measure the reference intensity I0 for each
source-detector pair. By ﬁtting this data in the spatial
frequency domain to (3) with α = α0 we obtain the dif-
α0/D = 0.58 cm−1 and the
fuse wavenumber k0 =
extrapolation length ℓ = 0.7 cm. Note that these param-
eters deﬁne the diﬀusion Green’s function G in the slab
geometry [10] and that α0 and D cannot be separately de-
termined from a continuous-wave measurement at a sin-
gle wavelength. Next, the object to be imaged is placed in
the sample chamber and the intensity I for each source-
detector pair is measured. In Fig. 2 we show the recon-
struction of a pair of black metal balls. The balls have a
diameter of 8 mm and were suspended in the midplane of
the sample chamber at a constant height with a separa-
tion of 3.2 cm. Tomographic images were reconstructed
with a 15 × 15 cm2 ﬁeld of view using 230 × 230 pixels per
image with a separation between the slices of 0.26 cm. It
can be seen in the central slice, which is equidistant from
the source and detector planes, that the balls are well
resolved. The shallower and deeper slices show that the
balls remain well resolved but with a smaller diameter, as
expected. Fig. 3 is a plot of δα/α0 along the line passing

through the centers of both balls in the central slice. The
distance between the peaks is 3.3 cm in close agreement
with the measured separation of the balls. The FWHM
of the peaks is 1.1 cm which slightly overestimates the
diameter of the balls. The FWHM of the peaks in the
depth direction is 1.5 cm (graph not shown). It is im-
portant to note that the reconstructed contrast in δα
is not expected to be quantitative due to the possible
breakdown of (2) in the interior of the strongly absorb-
ing balls. Interestingly, however, the shape and volume
of the spherical absorbers is recovered well.

the plane of sources is indicated. All images are normalized
to the maximum of the central slice.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of
analytic methods for image reconstruction in OT with
large data sets. We are currently conducting further
studies to assess the eﬀects of absorption contrast on
image resolution. In addition, the recent availability of
CCDs with faster data acquisition will allow the collec-
tion of data sets with greater numbers of sources, lead-
ing to improvements in spatial resolution. We expect
that with further technological advances, resolution con-
sistent with the results of numerical simulations [11] will
be achieved.

Abstract

Recently, multiple time scale characteristics of heart dynamics have received much
attention for distinguishing healthy and pathologic cardiac systems. Despite struc-
tural peculiarities of the fetal cardiovascular system, the fetal heart rate(FHR) dis-
plays multiple time scale characteristics similar to the adult heart rate due to the
autorhythmicity of its diﬀerent oscillatory tissues and its interaction with other
neural controllers. In this paper, we investigate the event and time scale charac-
teristics of the normal and two pathologic fetal heart rate groups with the help of
the new measure, called the Unit Time Block Entropy(UTBE), which approximates
the entropy at each event and time scale based on symbolic dynamics. This method
enables us to match the measurement time and the number of words between fetal
heart rate data sets simultaneously. We ﬁnd that in the small event scale and the
large time scale, the normal fetus and the two pathologic fetus are completely dis-
tinguished. We also ﬁnd that in the large event scale and the small time scale, the
presumed distress fetus and the acidotic distress fetus are signiﬁcantly distinguished.

1 Introduction

Fetal distress is generally used to describe the lack of the oxygen of the fetus,
which may result in damage or death if not reversed or the fetus is delivered

immediately. Thus the emergent action by discriminating the fetal distress
is an important issue in the obstetrics. In particular, it is important to dis-
criminate the normal Fetal Heart Rate(FHR) and two types of fetal distress
groups(the presumed distress and the acidotic distress) and reduce the wrong
diagnosis rate in which about 65% of the presumed distress fetus(not seri-
ous but in need of careful monitoring) are diagnosed as the acidotic distress
fetus(serious, needing an emergent action), experiencing a useless surgical op-
eration. In this paper, we try to discriminate the normal and pathologic fetal
heart rate group with a robust and reliable method.
The cardiovascular system of the fetus is a complex system. The complex
signal, the heart rate, from the complex system contains enormous informa-
tion about the various functions. The incoming information, on which various
heart activities are projected, can not be linearly separated into each func-
tion. But we may be able to estimate the signal from a pathologic fetal heart
which contains information on the weakness or a complete loss of a particular
function. Based on this concept, multiple time scale characteristic of heart
dynamics have received much attention. As a quantitative method, the Multi-
Scale Entropy, which quantiﬁes multi-time scale complexity in the heart rate,
was introduced and widely applied to the classiﬁcation between normal and
pathologic groups and also diﬀerent age groups. It was found that in a spe-
ciﬁc time scale region, the normal and the pathologic adult heart rate groups
and the diﬀerent age eﬀects on the heart rhythms are signiﬁcantly distin-
guished [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
The multiple-scale characteristic in the fetal heart rate is due to the autorhyth-
micity of its diﬀerent oscillatory tissues, its interaction with other neural con-
troller and the maternal circulatory system and other neural or hormonal
activities, which have a wide range of time scales from secondly to yearly[8].
In our previous work on the multiple-scale analysis of heart dynamics, we ex-
tended the analysis with the time scale to both the event and time scales[9].
We found that the event scale in heart dynamics plays more important role
than the time scale in classifying the normal and pathologic adult groups. In
this paper, therefore, we will investigate characteristic event or time scales of
heart dynamics of the normal and the fetal distress group in order to deter-
mine the criteria for classifying the normal and the fetal distress groups.
Previous works on the fetal heart rate were based on the various nonlinear
measures such as the multi-scale entropy, approximate entropy, power spec-
tral density and detrended ﬂuctuation analysis [10,11,12]. They were able to
signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiate the mean of normal and pathologic FHR groups but
their classiﬁcation performance was poor, which prevent practical applications
of these methods. In this paper, we investigate the typical scale structure of
each FHR group by scanning both the event and time scale regions in order to
ﬁnd an appropriate scale region for classifying the normal and the pathologic
fetal groups in an optimal way.
We introduce a new analysis method, called the Unit Time Block Entropy(UTBE),
which scans both the event and time scale regions of the heart rate based on

2

symbolic dynamics to ﬁnd the characteristic scale region of the normal and
the pathologic heart rate groups[9]. This method matches the unevenly sam-
pled RR interval data length and the measurement time of the heart rate data
set simultaneously, where the RR interval means the time duration between
consecutive R waves of the electrocardiogram(ECG). In most previous studies
the number of RR interval sequences of all data set are ﬁxed in spite of a large
variability in the measurement time[3,4,5,6,7,10]. Using the UTBE method, we
can directly compare the entropy of data sets without any ambiguity caused
by the nonstationarity and noise eﬀect that inevitably appears in the data set
with diﬀerent data length or measurement time. We ﬁnd that the normal and
two pathologic FHR groups are reliably discriminated.
In Section 2, we will introduce the normal and pathologic FHR data set and
their linear properties. In Section 3, the new analysis method, called Unit
Time Block Entropy(UTBE), is introduced and applied to the fetal heart rate
data set. In Section 4, we show that the normal, the presumed distress and the
acidotic distress FHR groups can be discriminated through the UTBE method
in some characteristic scale regions. Finally, we end with the conclusion.

2 The normal and pathologic fetal heart rates and their linear

properties

The fetal heart rate is acquired from 77 pregnant women who were placed
under computerized electronic fetal monitoring during the ante partum and
intra partum periods. The fetal heart rate is digitized with the data received
with the Corometrics 150 model(Corometrics, Connecticut, USA) through the
Catholic computer-assisted obstetric diagnosis system(CCAOD; DoBe Tech,
Seoul, Korea). The computerized electronic fetal heart rate monitoring was
done on the fetal heart rate data two hours before the delivery, from each
pregnant woman without any missing data. First, 77 pregnant women are di-
vided into two groups; 36 women into the normal fetus group, who showed the
normal heart rate tracing, and 41 women with the abnormal fetal heart rate
tracing(severe variable, late deceleration, bradycardia, or tachycardia, and de-
livery by caesarean section). The heart rate tracing has been done using as
a standard criteria to determine normal or pathologic states of a fetus. After
an immediate delibery by a caesarean section, the umbilical artery pHs of the
fetus is examined. Then, 41 women were further divided into the presumed
distress group with 26 women whose umbilical artery pHs was higher than
7.15, and the acidotic distress group with 15 women whose umbilical artery
pHs was lower than 7.15 and the base excess was lower than −8mM/l. By
this umbilical artery pHs test we can retrospectively know whether a fetus
was in dangerous situation or not. In this work, the wrong diagnosis rate is
26/41(63.4%), 26 women undertaken a useless surgical operation. The im-

provement of this wrong diagnosis rate through the presurgical classiﬁcation
of diﬀerent groups based on the FHR data is the main goal of this work.
In order to treat errors in the measuring equipment and ectopic beats we se-
lected the interval that did not have any missing data, and manually treated
the ectopic beats using a linear interpolation, which is less than 0.1% of
all heart beats selected. We replaced the ectopic beats with resampled data
around the vicinity of 2Hz using the average sampling frequency of each heart
rate sequence. The resampling, which is usually used for even sampling from
the unevenly measured heart beat, is restrictively applied for replacing ectopic
beats. However, this method inevitably produces a number of unexpected ar-
tiﬁcial eﬀects on the original RR sequences. For example, it can cause the
distortion of the short term correlation of heart rate data[13]. Thus a new
method is developed and applied to overcome these problems as in the follow-
ing section.

2.1 Linear Properties

Before applying the nonlinear method, we investigate conventional linear prop-
erties such as the mean and the standard deviation and its student t-test be-
tween healthy and pathologic groups(normal, presumed distress and acidotic
distress). In Fig.1(a)-(c), the RR interval time of three fetuses are presented.
The normal fetus shows a typical characteristic of the small, fast variations,
while the pathologic fetus shows relatively slower, larger variations. In Fig.1(d)
and (e), linear properties such as the mean, the standard deviation and the
log-log distribution of RR acceleration from the normal, the presumed distress
and the acidotic distress groups are presented. The result of the t-test on the
mean and the standard deviation distributions shows that three FHR groups
are distinguishable by these two linear properties, resulting in signiﬁcant p-
values for the mean and the standard deviation[p-value(for the mean/the stan-
dard deviation): the normal and the presumed distress(10−5/8 × 10−11), the
normal and the acidotic distress(0.018/3 × 10−5), the presumed distress and
the acidotic distress(0.28/0.903)]. Although their signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
mean and the standard deviation, their classiﬁcation performance based on
the sensitivity and speciﬁcity is poor. In the next section, we will compare the
linear properties with the nonlinear ones obtained from the UTBE and the
multi-scale entropy method. In Fig.1(e), the RR interval acceleration shows a
power-law distribution. This suggests that the RR interval acceleration rather
than RR interval has a nonlinear characteristics which can be best utilized in
classifying the diﬀerent FHR groups.

3 Unit Time Block Entropy(UTBE)

The investigation of linear properties such as the mean and the standard de-
viation of the RR sequence shows that the heart dynamics of the normal
fetus group is faster than that of the pathologic fetus group, leading to a sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence in the mean. However, the total measurement time shows
a large variability for the 77 subjects studied. In Fig.2, the mean and the
standard deviation of the measurement time of all RR interval sequence is
37.25 ± 5.04(min) and the time diﬀerence between the shortest one and the
longest one is 25.69(min). In treating the RR interval sequence, we typically
face this contradictory situation. If we try to match the number of RR inter-
val sequence in advance, the measurement time for all RR interval sequences
becomes diﬀerent. If we try to match the measurement time in advance, the
number of RR interval sequence becomes diﬀerent. This naturally occurs for
unevenly sampled data such as the RR interval sequence. In order to solve this
problem, we used the Unit Time Block Entropy(UTBE), which simultaneously
matches both the measurement time and the number of RR interval sequence

for all subjects. The UTBE estimates the entropy of the symbolic sequence
composed at the speciﬁc event and time scale of a heart beat sequence. Since it
matches both the measurement time and the number of words of the alphabet
from the RR sequence, we can make a direct comparison of all involved FHR
groups reliably.
First, we deﬁne a word sequence from the RR interval sequence. To construct
a word, we use a unit time windowing method, in which each word is con-
structed in a given unit time window, so the number of symbols involved in
each word can be diﬀerent between windows.
The RR interval sequence is given by T I = {x1, x2, . . . , xi, . . . , xn} and the
RR interval acceleration is by ∆T I = {t1, t2, . . . , ti, . . . , tn−1},
ti = xi+1 − xi.
A word is deﬁned as follows

wi = {sisi+1 . . . si+j . . . si+n(i)},

si+j =

0 ,



P

A word wi composed by a unit time windowing method consists of n(i) sym-
bols. The number of symbols, n(i), is diﬀerent at each unit time scale UT ,
i+n(i)
k=i xk ≤ UT . A symbol si+j, which is used to construct a word,
satisfying
is 1 for |ti+j| larger than τ and 0, otherwise. Here, UT is a unit time for
constructing a word and τ is a RR interval threshold or a RR acceleration
threshold for binary symbolization. Thus a word wi contains both information
about the time scale and the event scale of the heart rate. Therefore, it de-
ﬁnes a state of speciﬁc scale events of the cardiac system during a unit time.

6

The event scale varies with 20 steps from 5% to 95% of the cumulative rank
for all RR acceleration values from normal and pathologic HR data set. The
time scale varies with 20 steps from 1 second to 10 seconds, which 1 second is
suﬃciently short to avoid an empty word.
Fig.3 brieﬂy illustrates how to compose a word sequence from a RR interval
sequence. In the block windowing case, a word is deﬁned regularly with the
block size n=2 and the block is shifted to the one step next. In the unit time
windowing case, a word is deﬁned with a unit time UT and the unit time
windows shifted by 0.5 second to deﬁne the next word, allowing the window
overlap. The window shifting time, 0.5 second, is appropriately chosen to ac-
cumulate an enough number of sampled words. In this way, the unit time
widowing method can match the number of words and the total measurement
time of diﬀerent RR intervals sets, while the block windowing method cannot.
Through this procedure we can investigate the complexity of the symbolic RR
sequence composed at each time and event scale combination.
With the above word constructing method, we can compose a word sequence
from a RR interval sequence. Let W = {w1, w2, . . . , wn} be a ﬁnite, nonempty
set which we refer to as an alphabet. A string or word over W is simply a
ﬁnite sequence of elements of W. An alphabet W has the following relation,

W n ⊆ Wn ⊆ W ∗, W 0 = W0 = Θ ”empty word”,

(3)

where W ∗ is the set of all words over W, including the empty word, Θ, and
Wn the set of all words over W of length n or less and W n the set of all
words over W of length n. The number of possible words of Wn and W n are
N(n) = s1 + . . . si + . . . sn = s(n+1) − 1/s − 1 and N(n) = sn, respectively.
And s is a s-ary number, which in this paper is binary(s=2). And the number
of possible symbols in a word, n(i) = Int( UT
Ts ), varies with the unit time UT ,
which is used to construct a word. Ts is the smallest RR interval time and
n(UT ) is an integer number. Since n(UT ) depends on Ts, which is sensitive on
the ectopic beat or short term noisy beats, noise reduction should be done
carefully in preprocessing. The wi word sequence composed by the unit time
windowing method is a natural generalization of one based on the block win-
dowing method.

Based on this unit time windowing method, we calculate the symbolic entropy,
called the UTBE, which quantiﬁes complexity of a word sequence at speciﬁc
event and time scale region.

The entropy, H(UT , τ ), is a function of the time scale UT and the event scale
τ .

compose a word sequence from a RR interval sequence. The upper case presents
how to compose a word sequence from a RR interval sequence with the unit time
windowing method, on the other hand, the lower case presents how to compose a
word sequence with block windowing method. The former focus on unit time to
deﬁne a word but the latter focus on the number of symbols, in this example, the
block size is n=2, to deﬁne a word.

where p(i) = N (wi)
N (W ) is the estimation of the frequency of word wi and N(wi) is
the occurrence number of a word wi and N(W ) is the total number of sam-
pled words. To calculate the exact probability of a word wi, inﬁnite words are
considered with N(W ) → ∞. Then for s=2, UTBE varies between a lower
bound and a upper bound at each time scale. The lower bound occurs for
the completely regular case and the upper bound occurs for the completely
random case where all words are equally probable.
In this paper, to construct an appropriate word ensemble from a RR sequence,
the unit time scale is chosen up to 5 steps(about 2.8 seconds) for the UTBE.
At this time scale, the largest number of symbols contained in a word from
our data set is 8, which contribute to 2.9% of the population. The number of
possible words is 28 = 256 and the number of sampled words from our RR
interval sequence is 3,313 at this unit time scale. In the followings, we show
that among two scales, the event scale is more signiﬁcant for classiﬁcation of
healthy and two pathologic FHR groups than the time scale.

3.1 Application of the UTBE method

In Fig.4, we applied the UTBE method to the three FHR groups and show
the result of the search for all event and time scale regions. In order to com-
pare UTBE distributions between the normal and two pathologic groups, all
p-values of the student t-test in the (UT , τ ) parameter plane are presented in
Fig. 4(a-f). Since the scale characteristics of three groups are not known a pri-

9

ori, we scanned all event and time scales for optimization of the classiﬁcation.
For the presumed distress and the acidotic distress groups in the Fig.4(a) and
Fig.4(d), the event sequences composed by only the 50-80% cumulative rank
region in the RR interval acceleration are signiﬁcantly distinguished over all
time scales(p < 0.01). This suggests that the presumed distress and the aci-
dotic distress groups have relatively diﬀerent characteristics scale complexity
on this speciﬁc RR interval acceleration region. These two groups could not
be discerned by their linear properties[the p-value of (mean/standard devia-
tion):(0.28/0.903)]. For the normal and the acidotic distress groups in Fig.4(b)
and Fig.4(e), the event sequences composed by most RR interval acceleration
scales except the 50-75% cumulative rank region are distinguished in their
complexity(p < 10−4), while in event sequences composed by only narrow
RR interval scale regions, with 5% and 95% cumulative rank ones, show the
diﬀerence. It suggests that the RR interval acceleration of the normal and
the acidotic distress group contains signiﬁcant information on diﬀerent inter-
nal dynamics of the cardiac system, while the RR interval does not. For the
normal and the presumed distress groups in Fig.4(c) and Fig.4(f), most RR
interval scales could not discriminate these two groups except narrow regions,
with 5-35% ranks and 90-95% cumulative ranks, while a wide RR acceleration
scale region below the 50% cumulative rank signiﬁcantly discriminates these
two groups(p < 1.1 × 10−4).
The above results suggest that the normal, the presumed distress and the
acidotic distress groups exhibit characteristic scales with typical dynamics in
those scale regions. The information on the characteristic event and time scale
regions of three diﬀerent groups can be used to determine the optimal param-
eters for the classiﬁcation of diﬀerent group. Between two types of scales, the
event scale is more eﬀective than the time scale in classifying these groups.
When two groups are discriminated at an event scale region, these groups
are also well discriminated over most time scales. These results suggest that
the RR interval acceleration contains typical information about cardiac dy-
namics of three groups, whereas the RR interval does not. Since slow or fast
acceleration of the cardiac system is associated with fetal vagal activity and
the motherly-fetal respiratory exchange system, it may provide some clues to
which functional diﬀerence of cardiac systems causes such diﬀerence between
healthy and pathological groups.
In Fig.4(g)-(i), the best sensitivity and speciﬁcity in the (UT , τ ) parameter
plane is presented for the four measures of statistics and complexity for com-
parison, respectively.
The sensitivity determines that when a UTBE value is given for classifying
two groups(A,B) as a threshold, what percentage of the subjects involved in
the group A is correctly classiﬁed by the given threshold UTBE value. The
speciﬁcity determines that when a UTBE value is given for classifying two
groups as a threshold, what percentage of the subjects involved in the other
group B is correctly excluded from the group A. So if the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity are all 100%, the two groups are completely classiﬁed by the given

(85%,86%) for the normal group and the acidotic distress group(bold dotted line)
and (48%,48%) for the presumed group and acidotic distress group(dotted line).

threshold. Here, the best sensitivity and speciﬁcity are achieved after calcu-
lating them at all points of the (UT , τ ) parameter space, varying the threshold
from the minimum UTBE to the maximum UTBE value of the calculated
UTBE set[14]. Here, the best sensitivity and speciﬁcity is determined as the
highest values along the diagonal in the plane of the sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
As a result, UTBE using the RR interval acceleration as a threshold provides
the best performance in classiﬁcation of the presumed distress and the aci-
dotic distress, the normal and the acidotic distress, and the normal and the
presumed distress groups. Surprisingly, for the normal group and two types
of distress groups, UTBE using the RR interval acceleration as a threshold
completely discriminates these groups with sensitivity 100%, and the speci-
ﬁcity 100%, which could not be archived with two linear properties and the
UTBE using the RR interval threshold. For the presumed distress and the aci-
dotic distress groups, both UTBEs lead to the same result(sensitivity=71.4%,
speciﬁcity=72%).

3.2 Comparison with the conventional method(MultiScale Entropy)

In this section, we compare the performances of the UTBE and the MultiScale
Entropy(MSE), which has been widely used in the hear rate analysis[3,4,5,6,7].
The Multi-Scale Entropy calculates the approximate entropy(APEN) or the
sample entropy at diﬀerent scales with heart rate data, which measures the
regularity of a given data. Since the same data length(N=4061) is used in order
to remove the dependency on the data length, the approximate entropy is cho-
sen instead of the sample entropy. First, in order to calculate the APEN, the

11

RR sequence of length N(=4061) is divided into segments of length n and the
mean value is calculated for each segment. With the coarse-grained sequence
at each scale n, the APEN is computed with the following, the parameters;
the embedding dimension m=2 and the delay τ = 1[3,7]. In the calculation
of the Multi-Scale Entropy, we use two types of r values; one is determined
from the original data at n=1[r = 0.15 × SD(n = 1)] and the other is variable
to be determined at all n scales[r(n) = 0.15 × SD(n)]. By using the variable
r(n) we can remove the eﬀect of variation due to the coarse-graining process,
where SD(n) denotes the standard deviation of the coarse-grained sequence
at a scale n[15]. Since the Multi-Scale Entropy for two cases lead to the sim-
ilar results, we present here one for the ﬁrst case. In Fig.5(a) and (b), we
present the performance of Multi-Scale Entropy in the classiﬁcation of three
fetal heart rate groups. In Fig 5.(a), the best p-values for each pair of groups
in the student t-test are p = 1.8 × 10−10(n = 4) for the normal vs the aci-
dotic distress, p = 10−10(n = 4) for the normal vs the presumed distress and
p=0.143(n=1) for the presumed distress vs the acidotic distress. This result
shows that the mean Multi-Scale Entropy values of each group are signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent between the normal and two pathologic groups, but the mean
Multi-Scale Entropy values of two pathologic groups are not distinguishable.
In order to check the possibility of classiﬁcation, we investigate the sensitiv-
ity and speciﬁcity as in the UTBE. Fig.5(b) presents the best sensitivities and
speciﬁcities selected from the calculation in all scales. The best sensitivity and
speciﬁcity is (94%, 95%) at the scale(n=4) of the normal and the presumed
distress case, (85%, 86%) for the normal and the acidotic distress case and
(48%, 48%) for the presumed distress and the acidotic distress case. The clas-
siﬁcation performance of Multi-Scale Entropy is not better than that of the
UTBE in all classiﬁcation cases from the three groups. This is because UTBE
searches all the event and time scales to ﬁnd the optimal classiﬁcation of dif-
ferent characteristics of healthy and two pathologic data, while Multi-Scale
Entropy searches only the time scale.

Scale Characteristics of Healthy and Pathologic FHRs.

In this section, using the diﬀerence in the characteristic event scale between
the normal and two pathologic groups, we distinguish the normal, the pre-
sumed and acidotic groups systematically. In Fig.4(e) and (f), the normal
group is signiﬁcantly distinguished from the presumed distress group and
the acidotic distress group in the lower event scale region. In Fig.4(d), the
presumed distress group and the acidotic distress group are distinguished in
the relatively higher event scale region. Thus, with these characteristics, we
can make a strategy to systematically diﬀerentiate these groups based on the
UTBE. First, as in Fig.6(a), we separate the normal and pathologic groups by

a threshold of 7.8 in the UTBE, which is determined as the smallest UTBE
value of the normal group, at the speciﬁc time and event scale(3 seconds,5%
rank),respectively. From this procedure, we can diﬀerentiate the normal and
the pathologic groups with a 100% accuracy. Then, for the fetuses deviating
from the normal group, usually having the lower UTBE, we try to separate
the presumed and the acidotic distress groups. In this case, we determine the
threshold UTBE as 1.4 bits in the time and event scale, which are the ﬁrst
step(1 sec) and the tenth step(about 50% rank), respectively. These time and
event scales are selected from the scan of the parameter space as in Fig.4(d),
in which these two groups are distinguished well on the scale region above the
tenth event scale. With this threshold, 9 acidotic fetuses out of 14 are distin-
guished. However, some ambiguity still remains. The clinical determination of
the presumed distress fetus and the acidotic distress fetus was carried out by
the umbilical artery PHs. In Fig.6(b), we mark the three fetuses with ’E’ in
each group, who have the umbilical artery PHs closest to the threshold value of
PHs, 7.15. The range of umbilical artery PHs measured is from 6.863 to 7.38.
The PHs values of the six fetuses are 7.229, 7.24 and 7.226 in the presumed
distress group and 7.15, 7.16 and 7.144 in the acidotic distress group. Since all
the pathologic fetuses were delivered by caesarean surgery after several signs
of distress(severe variable, later deceleration, bradycardia, or tachycardia), it
is not certain if all the acidotic distress fetuses would go to the emergency
state or all the presumed distress would be in the safety state. Therefore, if
the fetuses marked with ’E’ are excluded in this analysis, the characteristic
of two groups can be clariﬁed more clearly. As a result, most acidotic distress
fetuses are less complex than the most presumed distress fetuses at the time
and event scale regions. In the comparison of three groups, two pathologic
groups are less complex than the normal group, while in the comparison of
two pathologic groups the acidotic distress group is less complex than the pre-
sumed group. We ﬁnd that in order to distinguish the normal and pathologic

13

fetuses a small event scale(5% rank) and a relatively large time scale(3 sec) of
fetal heart dynamics is useful. On the other hand, in order to distinguish the
presumed distress and the acidotic distress fetuses a large event scale(about
50 % rank) and a relatively small time scale(1 sec) of fetal heart dynamics is
more appropriate. With these scale regions, we were able to reduce the wrong
diagnosis rate from 63.4%(26/41) to 24.3%(10/41).

5 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we investigated the event and time scale structure of the normal
and pathologic groups. We also introduced and calculated the UTBE method
in the appropriate event and time scale region to distinguish the three groups.
To extract meaningful information from the data set, the scale structure of
the RR interval acceleration is found to be more helpful than that of the RR
interval. In the comparison of the UTBE over all event and time scale regions,
we found that the normal, the presumed distress and the acidotic distress
groups have relatively diﬀerent event scale structures in the RR interval ac-
celeration. In particular, for the normal and two pathologic groups the UTBE
from the RR acceleration threshold completely classiﬁes these groups in a
chosen scale regions, although both linear properties and UTBE using the RR
interval threshold performs worse. In the case of the presumed distress and
the acidotic distress groups, it also provides better classiﬁcation performance
than other measures. The comparison with the Multi-Scale Entropy also shows
that the UTBE method performs better. It is due to the fact that the UTBE
approach searches the event and time scale region, while the Multi-Scale En-
tropy method searches only the time scale.
Based on the diﬀerence in the scale structure, we are able to systematically
distinguish three FHR groups. The normal and the pathologic groups are sep-
arated in a small event scale(5% rank) and a large time scale(3 sec). Then,
the fetuses deviating from the normal group are separated into the presumed
fetuses and the acidotic fetuses at a relatively large event scale(50% rank)
and a small time scale(1sec). From these scale regions, we reduce the wrong
diagnosis rate signiﬁcantly.
The results suggest that the UTBE approach is useful for ﬁnding the charac-
teristic scale diﬀerence between healthy and pathologic groups. In addition,
we can make a more reliable comparison between all fetuses by simultaneous
matching of the measurement time and the number of words. This approach
can be applied to the other unevenly sampled data taken from complex sys-
tems such as biomedical, meteorological or ﬁnancial tick data. In this study,
we also reconﬁrm that the more pathological a fetus is the less complex its
dynamics, following the pathological order, from the acidotic distress, the pre-

14

sumed distress and to the normal fetus. This indicates that in spite of the
peculiarity of the fetal cardiac system, the generic notion of the complexity
loss can be applied to the fetal cardiac system.
But these results come from a retrospective test under the well elaborated con-
dition. In a practical view point, the prospective test is necessary to conﬁrm
the selected scale regions and its classiﬁcation performance. We will further
test these results with more subjects for the purpose of practical application
of this analysis method.

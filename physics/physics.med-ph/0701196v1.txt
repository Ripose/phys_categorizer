Abstrat

During the past years several variane redution tehniques for Monte Carlo eletron transport have been developed in

order to redue the omputation time of eletron transport. Those tehniques have been evaluated for absorbed dose.

We have implemented the Maro Response Monte Carlo (MRMC) method in order to evaluate the eletron spetrum

to use as phase spae input generator for other alulation programs. Suh tehnique uses probability distributions

for eletron histories previously simulated in spheres (alled kugels). Those probability is used to sample the primary

eletron's (cid:28)nal state after a step inluding reation of seondaries and photons. We have ompared MRMC eletron

spetra simulated in homogeneous phantom against Geant4 ones. The results showed an agreement better than 6%

in the spetra peak energies. Those tests showed that MRMC ode is up to 12 times faster than Geant4 simulations.

Key words: eletron spetrum, variane redution tehniques, Monte Carlo

Currently, treatment planning system for eletron

ways have been provided to alulate the 3D dose

and reate seondaries. The Evolution generate its

distributions from analytial approximation suh as

The simulated spetra of our implementation of

MRMC ode have showed a good agreement and the

speed gain goes from 3 to 12 times when ompared

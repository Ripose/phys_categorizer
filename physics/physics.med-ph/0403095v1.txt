Monte Carlo simulations using the code PENELOPE have been performed to test
a simpliﬁed model of the source channel geometry of the Leksell GammaKnifer. The
characteristics of the radiation passing through the treatment helmets are analysed in detail.
We have found that only primary particles emitted from the source with polar angles smaller
than 3o with respect to the beam axis are relevant for the dosimetry of the Gamma Knife.
The photons trajectories reaching the output helmet collimators at (x, y, z = 236 mm), show
strong correlations between ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2 and their polar angle θ, on one side, and between
tan−1(y/x) and their azimuthal angle φ, on the other. This enables us to propose a simpliﬁed
model which treats the full source channel as a mathematical collimator. This simpliﬁed
model produces doses in excellent agreement with those found for the full geometry. In the
region of maximal dose, the relative diﬀerences between both calculations are within 3%, for
the 18 and 14 mm helmets, and 10%, for the 8 and 4 mm ones. Besides, the simpliﬁed model
permits a strong reduction (larger than a factor 15) in the computational time.

1. Introduction

Leksell GammaKnifer (GK) is an instrument that permits a precise external irradiation to
treat intracraneal lesions. Concentrating the radiation coming from 201 60Co sources, a high
dose can be delivered to the target area with an accuracy better than 0.3 mm (Wu et al 1990,
Elekta 1992, Benjamin et al 1997). Besides, the sharp dose gradient allows to reduce the
doses absorbed by the critical brain structures surrounding the lesion to be treated. The size
and shape of the ﬁnal beam can be ﬁxed by combining diﬀerent treatment helmets with an
adequate conﬁguration of plugged and unplugged sources. In this way the isodose distribution
curves can be modiﬁed in the optimal way. The GK is used together with GammaPlanr
(GP), a planning system which uses semi-empirical algorithms with various approximations
to calculate the doses, and assumes that the target is composed of unit density material (Wu
et al 1990, Wu 1992, Elekta 1996).

To ensure the quality of the planning system, an experimental veriﬁcation is needed
(Hartmann et al 1995), but the diﬃculties inherent to the physical dose measurements make
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to be a good complementary tool to achieve this purpose.
In the case of the GK, a number of such calculations have been performed in the last few
years. Most of them have been done with EGS4 (Cheung et al 1998, 1999a, 1999b, 2000,
Xiaowei and Chunxiang 1999) and have shown no relevant diﬀerences from GP calculations
for a homogeneous phantom. However, in stereotactic radiosurgery, Solberg et al (1998)
have pointed out a remarkable disagreement between MC results and those predicted by the
usual planning systems, once phantom inhomogeneities are taken into account. For the GK,
Cheung et al (2001) have found discrepancies up to 25% in case of extreme conditions (mainly
near tissue interfaces and dose edges.)

Recently, Moskvin et al (2002) have performed a detailed study in which they have
determined the characteristics of the beams emitted after the helmets and have used them to

2

calculate the dose ﬁeld inside a polystyrene phantom. These authors have used PENELOPE
(v. 2000) and have found a good agreement with the calculations performed in previous works
and with the predictions of the GP, what ensures the suitability of PENELOPE for this kind
of simulations.

In the present work we want to go deeper in some of the basic aspects analysed by
Moskvin and collaborators (2002). We have simulated a single source of the GK using the
version 2001 of PENELOPE (Salvat et al 2001) and we have investigated the energy spectra,
the particle spatial distributions and the correlations between the polar and azimuthal angles
of the particle trajectories and the coordinates of the point these trajectories reach the
treatment helmets. The results we have obtained permit a simpliﬁcation of the full geometry
which allows a considerable reduction of the simulation CPU time, without loss of accuracy
in the doses delivered to the phantom.

In the next section we describe the geometrical model we have used to simulate the
single source of the GK as well as the relevant details concerning the MC calculations we
have performed. Section 3 is devoted to discuss the results we have obtained and study the
geometrical simpliﬁcation we propose. Finally we draw our conclusions.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Leksell GammaKnifer model

Details concerning the GK geometry have been obtained from the User Manual (Elekta 1992).
In actual simulations, the diﬀerent pieces forming the head and the collimating system have
been described by the speciﬁc geometries sketched in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1a shows the capsule. It is made of stainless steel (SS) and includes the 60Co
active core. The latter (in black in the ﬁgure) is formed by 20 cylindrical pellets of 1 mm
diameter and 1 mm height. In our simulations, the active core is considered as an unique
cylindrical source of 1 mm diameter and 20 mm height made of cobalt.

The capsule is inside a bushing system made of aluminum. In our simulations we have

used the simpliﬁed geometry plotted in ﬁgure 1b.

Figure 1c shows the geometry we have considered for the collimation system of the single
source. The radiation coming from the 60Co source is collimated by a stationary collimator
(located in the central body) and an additional collimator located in the helmet. The ﬁrst one
is made of tungsten and lead, while that of the helmet is of tungsten. Four diﬀerent helmets
are available, producing beams with nominal aperture diameters of 4, 8, 14 and 18 mm at
the focal point of the system, which is located at 401 mm from the source centre. The inner
and outer collimator diameters of the helmets we have used are given in table 1 and have
been taken from Moskvin et al (2002).

Finally, ﬁgure 1d shows the complete geometry including the head of the instrument
(which is made of iron) and the phantom used to simulate the patient head. The latter is a
sphere of 160 mm of diameter, ﬁlled with water and centered in the focus. The situation of
the single source channel we have considered in our simulations is also shown.

2.2. Monte Carlo calculations

In this work we have used the PENELOPE (v. 2001) MC code (Salvat et al 2001) to perform
the simulations. PENELOPE is a general purpose MC code which allows to simulate the
coupled electron-photon transport. It can be applied for energies ranging from a few hundred

PENELOPE permits a good description of the particle transport at the interfaces and presents
an accurate simulation at low energies. As an example we mention here that the code has been
used to simulate an accelerator head, obtaining results in good agreement with measurements
(Sempau et al 2001).

In PENELOPE, analog simulation is performed for photons. On the other hand, electron
and positron simulation is done in a mixed scheme in which collisions are classiﬁed in two

types: hard and soft. Hard collisions are simulated in a detailed way and are characterised by
polar angular deﬂections or energy losses larger than certain cutoﬀ values. Soft collisions do
not fulﬁl these conditions and their eﬀects are described in terms of a condensed simulation
based on a multiple scattering theory. The electron tracking is controlled by means of four
parameters: C1 and C2, Wcc and Wcr. The ﬁrst two refer to elastic collisions. C1 gives the
average angular deﬂection produced by multiple elastic scattering along a path length equal
to the mean free path between consecutive hard elastic events. C2 represents the maximum
value permitted for the average fractional energy loss between consecutive hard elastic events.
On the other hand, Wcc and Wcr are energy cutoﬀs to separate hard and soft events. Thus, the
inelastic electron collisions with energy loss W < Wcc and the emission of Bremsstrahlung
photons with energy W < Wcr are considered in the simulation as soft interactions. The
particles are simulated for energies above a given absorption energy, Eabs, below which they
are absorbed locally. Besides, the length of the steps generated in the simulation is limited by
an upper bound, smax. Table 2 shows the values of these parameters for the various materials
used in our simulations. The values ﬁxed for the diﬀerent parameters in the various materials
permit to obtain results in reasonable CPU times. The key point here concerns the relative
large absorption energies adopted for electrons in the heavier materials, where high energy
electrons produce a very large number of secondary particles. These particles are not relevant
for the dosimetry in the phantom and the Eabs value we have chosen avoid the loss of CPU
time following their tracks. We have checked that the use of the parameter set shown in table
2 does not aﬀect the precision of the ﬁnal results.

To ﬁnish with the description of the MC code, it is worth to mention the main diﬀerences
between the version 2001 that we have used and the 2000, used by Moskvin et al (2002),
of PENELOPE. These aﬀect the model used to describe the electron and positron elastic
collisions, the Bremsstrahlung emission produced by electrons and positrons, the photon
photoelectric absorption cross sections and the ﬂuorescence processes taken into account.
Details can be found in Salvat et al (2001). We have performed some basic simulations using
both versions of the code and the results obtained showed no diﬀerences. Then we do not
expect diﬀerences between our results and those of Moskvin et al (2002) other than those
linked to possible diﬀerences in the geometries considered.

The radionuclide was assumed to be uniformly distributed inside the active core. 60Co
decays via β− to excited 60Ni. However, the emitted electrons do not exit the bushing
assembly. Excited 60Ni decays to its ground state by emitting two photons with energies
1.17 and 1.33 MeV. In our simulations we have assumed that photons are emitted with the
average energy 1.25 MeV. This does not produce any eﬀect on the results. The direction
of the emitted photons was supposed to be isotropic around the initial position. In actual
calculations, and in order to perform the simulations in reasonable times, this direction was

angle of the direction of the emitted photons, was sampled uniformly between 1 and cos θmax
and the initial azimuthal angle φi was sampled uniformly between 0 and 2π.

The statistical uncertainties were calculated by scoring, in each voxel, both the quantity
of interest Q and its square for each history. Thus, the MC estimate of the quantity is given
by

The geometries discussed in the previous section were described by means of the
geometrical package PENGEOM of PENELOPE in terms of quadric surfaces. Table 3 gives
the composition and densities of the diﬀerent materials used in our simulations.

The system for a single source presents cylindrical symmetry. The reference system was
located with the origin in the centre of the active core, with the z axis along the source
and pointing toward the phantom. The diﬀerent magnitudes, and in particular the dose rate
D(ρ, z), were supposed to be functions of the z and ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2 coordinates.

The full volume of the water phantom was subdivided into annular volume bins with
thicknesses ∆ρ = 0.5 mm and ∆z = 1 mm in case of the 18 and 14 mm treatment helmets. For
the smaller ones, 8 and 4 mm, the values considered were ∆ρ = 0.25 mm and ∆z = 0.5 mm

3. Results

3.1. Eﬀective emission angle

eﬀ

The ﬁrst point to be ﬁxed in order to perform the simulations is to determine the value of
the semi-aperture θmax of the cone where the direction of the initial photon is sampled. To
do that we have deﬁned the “eﬀective emission angle”, θα
eﬀ, as the angle θi of the direction
of an emitted primary photon such as it, or any of the secondary particles it creates passing
through the collimator, reaches a certain region α (e.g. a body or a plane) in the simulation
geometry. In particular we have studied the distribution of the eﬀective emission angle at
the water phantom, θphantom

.

Moskvin et al (2002) sampled the initial directions of the emitted photons in a cone
with 10o of semi-aperture and checked that no diﬀerences, within statistical uncertainties,
were observed by increasing this value up to 90o for the 18 mm helmet. We have performed
a simulation with the full geometry of the GK, for the 18 mm helmet. A total of 6 · 107
histories were followed and the initial directions were sampled in a cone with semi-aperture
θmax = 20o. The distribution of the fraction of initial photons vs. the cosine of θphantom
is shown in ﬁgure 2. As we can see, the distribution reduces by three orders of magnitude
between 0o and 5o. The insert in the same ﬁgure shows, with more detail, the distribution
in this interval. The number of counts for θphantom
= 2o (3o) is more than two (three) orders
of magnitude smaller than for θphantom

Despite that a semi-aperture of 3o for the cone in which the initial directions are sampled
is considerably smaller than that used by Moskvin et al (2002), we have checked that it

suﬃces to obtain right doses in the phantom. We have performed a simulation in the
previous conditions, following 15·107 histories. The dose D(ρ, z0) per disintegration in planes
transverse to the beam axis direction with z0 = 350, 401 and 450 mm (these are before the
focus, at the focus and after it, respectively) are plotted in ﬁgure 3, as a function of the
distance to the beam axis, ρ. Therein black squares stand for the full calculation (that is
sampling the initial directions into the cone with semi-aperture 20o), while open circles give
the dose due to histories whose the primary particle was emitted with an angle θi ≤ 3o. Both
linear (left) and logarithmic (right) plots are included to see the small and large ρ behaviour
clearly. As we can see both results coincide within the statistical uncertainties and, as a
consequence, we can state that a maximum polar angle θmax = 3o for sampling the initial
particle direction is enough to ensure the accuracy of the results.

3.2. Comparison with previous results

With the value θmax = 3o determined as explained in the previous section, we have performed
simulations considering the full geometry of the GK and following 6 · 107 histories.

Figure 4 shows the dose proﬁles in the plane of the focus, transverse to the beam axis
(z = 401 mm) for the four helmets. Therein the squares correspond to the simulations we
have performed, normalised to the maximum. Full curves show the results of Cheung et
al. (1998), while broken curves are given by the manufacturer.‡ The agreement with the
results of Cheung et al (1998) is very good (these authors quoted an error below 1% at dose

3.3. Characteristics of the beam after the helmets

Now we analyse the characteristics of the beam after it goes through the outer collimators of
the helmets. We have performed simulations with the full geometry of the GK, sampling the
initial directions with θmax = 3o and following 6 · 107 histories.

Figure 5. Distributions of particles per initial photon vs. the energy at the output
collimators of the four treatment helmets. Squares (triangles) correspond to photons
(electrons).

First we have studied the energy spectra at the output collimators of the four helmets
and for both photons (squares) and electrons (triangles). Results are plotted in ﬁgure 5.
In the four cases, the photon spectra show a pronounced peak corresponding to the initial
energy. For lower energies, the spectra are rather uniform. Below 100 keV, the peaks due
to characteristic x rays emitted after the relaxation of vacancies produced in K shells of
the tungsten or lead atoms of the collimation system can be distinguished, especially for
the 18 mm helmet. In general the number of particles exiting the output collimators of the
helmets diminishes, as expected, with their aperture.

In what respect to electrons, one can see that their relative importance reduces with the
aperture of the helmet. On the other hand, the artiﬁcial discontinuity at 500 keV is due to
the corresponding absorption energy in the materials forming the collimators.

In view of these results, we can say that most of the particles traversing the helmet
output collimators have the initial energy and, as a consequence, they are primary photons

the radial distance from the beam axis ρ. The results obtained at the planes z0 = 350,
401 and 450 mm are shown. The simulations have been performed for θmax = 3o.
Black squares correspond to the dose deposited by photons and electrons with any
energy, while open circles give the dose due to photons with the maximum energy
only. Left (right) panels are in linear (semi-logarithmic) scale. The values include the
geometrical factor (1 − cos 3o)/2 which renormalizes the number of particles emitted
in the 3o cone to the total number of particles emitted in actual situations (which
correspond to polar angles between 0 and π).

Therein we have plotted the dose D(ρ, z0) per disintegration in the planes z0 = 350, 401 and

plots, while the right ones are logarithmic plots pointing out the situation for large ρ values.
Black squares correspond to the full simulation, whereas open circles are the results obtained
by taking into account the photons arriving to the phantom with the initial energy, only. As
we can see, the diﬀerences between both results are rather small.

Figure 7. Distributions of particles per initial photon vs. the radial distance from the
beam axis ρ at the output collimators of the four treatment helmets. Shadow regions
represent the semi-aperture of these collimators. Squares (triangles) correspond to
photons (electrons). The dashed line indicates the semi-aperture of the beam at the
same z, if the helmets were not present.

The second point of interest concerns the particle spatial distribution at the helmet
output collimators. Figure 7 shows the particle distributions in the transverse direction ρ
for the four treatment helmets. Squares (triangles) correspond to photons (electrons). The
results of the simulations are divided by the number of initial histories and by the surface
of the scoring bin (π(ρ2
<)), which has ∆ρ = ρ> − ρ< = 0.1 mm. The shadow region
indicates the semi-aperture of the ﬁnal collimators of the helmets.

The general trend is similar for the four helmets. The distribution appears to be uniform
inside the characteristic aperture, reducing considerably for larger values of ρ. In case of the
14, 8 and 4 mm helmets, a second step at ρ ∼ 6 mm is observed. This is due to the output
collimator of the central body of the collimation system and corresponds, in fact, to the
semi-aperture of the beam at the same z, if the helmets were not present. The dashed line
in ﬁgure 7 indicates this semi-aperture. This step is not observed in the case of the 18 mm

Figure 8. Distributions of particles per initial photon vs. cos θ for the trajectories
traversing the output collimators of the four treatment helmets. Squares (triangles)
correspond to photons (electrons). Solid lines represent distributions of particles per
initial photons vs. the eﬀective angle distributions at the same surfaces, θhoc
eﬀ .

The particle distribution vs.

the angle θ of the particle trajectories once they pass
through the helmet output collimators deserves also to be analysed. Figure 8 shows with
squares (triangles) the distributions, per initial photon, corresponding to photons (electrons).
As we can see, in the case of photons, there is a ﬁrst region, for angles θ ∼ 0o, where the
distribution is uniform. In the case of the two smallest helmets, a second region of uniformity
appears for larger angles. The ﬁrst one is related to the characteristic aperture of each helmet
collimator, while the second is linked to the aperture of the ﬁnal collimator of the central
body.

In the ﬁgure we have also plotted (full curves) the distributions of the fraction of
initial photons vs.
the cosine of the eﬀective emission angle determined at the helmet
outer collimators, θhoc
eﬀ . These distributions are very similar to the previous ones, the main
diﬀerence being that those corresponding to the output angles show a larger reduction after
the ﬁrst region of uniformity. This points out the strong angular focalization produced by
the collimation system.

In what refers to the electron distributions, they show very low statistics what indicates

that their contribution to the dosimetry of the GK is not relevant.

3.4. Correlations

An important aspect concerning the characteristics of the beams is that associated to the
correlations between the relevant variables, these are, the energy of the particles, their
positions and the angles deﬁning their trajectories once they reach the output helmet
collimators.

The study of the correlations of the energy with ρ and θ shows that, as expected from
the previous results, particles with energies other than the initial one are practically not
present, irrespective of the ρ or θ values one considers.

Figure 9. Correlations between the ρ distance to the beam centre and cos θ for the
particle trajectories at the output collimators of the four treatment helmets. Solid
lines represent the curves corresponding to the mathematical collimation considered
in the simpliﬁcation described in the text.

A more interesting result is shown by the correlations between the geometrical variables.
Figure 9 shows the results found for ρ and cos θ and, as we can see, there exists a strong
correlation between both variables: the angle where the cos θ distribution is peaked increases
with ρ. In this respect it is worth to note that we have used a non-linear gray scale in order to
enhance the regions with lower correlations. These results agree with the ﬁndings of Moskvin
et al (2002).

However, these are not the unique correlations between the geometrical variables
involved in the problem. Figure 10 represents the correlations shown by the azimuthal angle
of the trajectory of the particle and the quantity tan−1(y/x) calculated with the coordinates
of this trajectory at the output helmet collimators. As we can see, these two quantities are
strongly correlated for the four treatment helmets. The larger spread shown by the helmets

with the smaller collimators are due to the lower statistics in these cases. This correlation
was not explicitly mentioned by Moskvin et al (2002), but, however, it is on the basis of the
simpliﬁcation of the source channel geometry we discuss below.

To test these correlations we have found, we have performed a new simulation in which
the particles are emitted from the helmet outer collimators, according to the distributions
discussed above and conditioned to these correlations. The procedure we have carried out
has been the following. First, we have sampled the initial position (x, y) uniformly within
the aperture of the helmet outer collimators. Second, the value of cos θ for the trajectory
has been sampled according to the conditional distribution for the corresponding ρ value
(see ﬁgure 9). Finally, the azimuthal angle φ has been sampled according to the conditional
distribution corresponding to the particular value tan−1(y/x) (see ﬁgure 10). Only photons
with initial energy ﬁxed to the maximum value 1.25 MeV have been considered and a total
of 2 · 107 histories has been followed. This strategy coincides with that used by Moskvin et
al (2002). The results obtained in this way (solid lines) are compared to those obtained with
the full GK geometry (open circles) in ﬁgure 11, normalized to the maximum. As we can see,
the agreement between both calculations is rather satisfactory.

distance from the beam axis ρ. The results obtained in our simulations at the plane
z0 = 401 mm for the four helmets are shown. Open circles correspond to our full
calculation. Solid lines have been obtained by taking into account the correlations
found for the diﬀerent variables (see text). Dashed lines correspond to a similar
calculation but ignoring the φ angle correlations, that is by sampling the φ angle
uniformly between 0 and 2π.

dosimetry of the GK, we have performed a new simulation following the same procedure, but
neglecting the correlations shown by the azimuthal angle φ, which has been sampled uniformly
between 0 an 2π. The results obtained are shown, again normalized to the maximum, with
dashed lines in ﬁgure 11. As we can see, if the φ angle correlations are neglected, the shape
of the dose proﬁle at the focus is strongly modiﬁed, showing a big enhancement at distances
close to the beam axis.

3.5. Simpliﬁcation of the source

The simpliﬁcation in the description of the source of the GK that we propose in this work
consists in substituting the full source channel by a “mathematical collimator” in which a
point source situated in the center of the active core, emits photons with initial energy equals
to 1.25 MeV in the cone deﬁned by itself and the outer collimators of the treatment helmets.
The reasons for that rely, ﬁrst, on the characteristics distributions (energy, position and
polar angle) of the particles traversing the collimation channel, and, second and mainly, on
the strong correlations shown by φ and tan−1(y/x) and by θ and ρ, respectively. In fact, if we

assume the simpliﬁcation mentioned, it is obvious that the azimuthal angle φ of a trajectory
is related to the point (x, y) at which it reaches the outer collimator source as (see the scheme
in ﬁgure 1c)

17

a value which is in agreement with the maximum of the distributions in ﬁgure 10. On the
other hand, in this simpliﬁed situation, the polar angle θ of this trajetory is related to the
corresponding value of ρ in this surface as

φ ≡ tan

−1(y/x) ,

tan θ ≡

ρ
zcol

,

where zcol is the z coordinate of the output collimator of the helmets (236 mm in our case).
In ﬁgure 9 we have plotted, with solid lines, the quantity cos[tan−1(ρ/zcol)] and, as we can
see, it ﬁts perfectly the maximum of the respective distributions.

have proposed.

following 2 · 107 histories, assuming a point source situated at the center of the 60Co source,
considering only photons with initial energy 1.25 MeV and performing a “mathematical
collimation” by sampling the initial particle directions isotropically inside the corresponding

The results, normalized to the maximum, are plotted with solid lines in ﬁgure 12, where we
compare them with those of the simulation considering the full GK geometry (open circles).
The uncertainties in the case of the simpliﬁed model are a factor 3 (at least) smaller than those
quoted for the full GK geometry. The agreement between both simulations is remarkable. In
the region of maximal dose, the relative diﬀerences between both calculations are within 3%,
for the 18 and 14 mm helmets, and 10%, for the 8 and 4 mm ones, where the uncertainties of
the full calculation results are relatively large. This shows the feasibility of this simpliﬁcation.
Besides, this simpliﬁed model provides a large reduction (more than a factor 15) in the

CPU time needed to perform the simulations.

4. Conclusions

In this work we have investigated the dosimetry of a single-source conﬁguration of the Leksell
GammaKnifer using the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE (v. 2001). To do that a series of
simulations have been performed from which the following conclusions can be drawn:

(i) We have found that a maximum angle θmax = 3o for sampling the initial direction of the

emitted photons is enough to ensure the accuracy of the results.

(ii) The characteristics of the beam after it goes trough the output collimators of the helmets
indicate that most of the particles traversing these collimators are photons coming
directly from the 60Co source.

(iii) The polar angle θ and the distance to the beam axis ρ of the particle trajectories at the
output collimators of the helmets are strongly correlated. The same happens for the
azimuthal angle φ and the ratio y/x of the corresponding coordinates.

(iv) These strong correlations can be explained by assuming that the collimation system acts
as a mathematical collimator in which the particles are emitted in a cone deﬁned by the
output collimators of the helmets and come from a point source located at the center of
the active core.

The results obtained with the simpliﬁed geometry model we propose here are in good
agreement with those found for the full geometry. Besides, the CPU time needed to perform
the simulations is largely reduced. This opens the possibility to use MC tools for planning
purposes in the GK. Obviously, a comparison of the results obtained from calculations
based on this simpliﬁed approach, for various conﬁgurations of the 201 sources of the GK,
with previous works is necessary. Also it is worth to perform a detailed analysis of the
corresponding output factors. Work in these directions is being done and will be published
in a forthcoming paper.

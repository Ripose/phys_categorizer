Abstract— GePEToS is a simulation framework developed over
the last few years for assessing the instrumental performance of
future PET scanners. It is based on Geant4, written in Object-
Oriented C++ and runs on Linux platforms. The validity of
GePEToS has been tested on the well-known Siemens ECAT
EXACT HR+ camera. The results of two application examples are
presented : the design optimization of a liquid Xe µPET camera
dedicated to small animal imaging as well as the evaluation of
the effect of a strong axial magnetic ﬁeld on the image resolution
of a Concorde P4 µPET camera.

I. INTRODUCTION

Over the last decade, the performance of Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) scanners have considerably improved. For
instance, commercial cameras dedicated to small animals
now feature a space resolution below 2 mm along with a
sensitivity better than 1% [1]. No matter how beneﬁcial this
performance gain has been to users, for instrument designers, it
has somehow hardened the challenge of ﬁnding new solutions
which would go beyond the present instrumental limits at
an affordable cost. This is why the complete simulation of
new TEP conﬁgurations under study has now become even
more justiﬁed than in the past, and calls for the development
of a dedicated simulation framework, sufﬁciently versatile to
allow fast and very detailed approaches with the best-existing
emulation of all the underlying physical processes. Since its
ﬁrst public release in 1998, the stability, the validity and hence
the popularity of Geant4 [2]- the Object-Oriented particle
tracking and transport simulation framework developed by the
High Energy Physics community - have noticeably progressed.
In our opinion, it has become the best toolkit from which
any common and public TEP simulation framework should be
developed. GePEToS : Geant4 Positron Emission Tomography
Simulation, is a ﬁrst attempt that we have made over the last
few years to reach this goal .

and then in the transport and interaction of its two 511 keV
annihilation photons, efforts were made to check the validity of
Geant4 and if needed corrections or modiﬁcations were done.
Hence, we have added as part of GePEToS the possibility to
generate positrons according to their respective β+ spectra
for 18F, 15O, 11C (ﬁgure 1 for 18F). Table I shows the
good agreement between our simulation and experimental data
for the maximum and the most probable energies for each
spectrum. After this step, the positrons are fully tracked down
until they annihilate.

As Geant4 did not correctly reproduce the acolinearity of
the two annihilation photons ((θγγ − π rad.) ≃ 10 mrad
FWHM) which affects the image resolution, the native Geant4
algorithm has been modiﬁed to obtain a correct annihilation
behavior in water where this phenomenon takes place in PET
(ﬁgure 2). In water, the experimental measurement shows an
energy shift between the two annihilation photons due to the
orbital motion of the atomic electrons. This energy distribution
is gaussian centered on zero with ∆E = 2.59 keV (FWHM)
[4]. The relation between the energy shift and the acolinearity

Finally, two Geant4 electromagnetic (EM) process packages
the Standard one and the LowEnergy
have been tested :
one, dedicated to low EM physical processes. Comparisons
between these two packages and the NIST experimental data
[5] have been achieved. As an example, results on the total
attenuation coefﬁcient are presented hereafter on ﬁgure 3 :
the low energy process package provides results in much
better agreement with the experimental data. The difference is
explained by the absence of Rayleigh scattering in the standard
EM package. Indeed, the Low Energy package is now used
in GePEToS even though it slightly increases the code CPU
consumption.

III. FRAMEWORK DESCRIPTION

GePEToS as Geant4, is fully written in Object-Oriented
C++. It runs on Linux platforms (tested on RedHat 6.2). It
uses a simple mechanism to deﬁne the geometry and the
material composition of most of the PET cameras currently
commercialized or under development (multi-ring and multi-
crystal block devices). This is achieved by setting an ASCII
conﬁguration ﬁle in which users can select the desired β+
isotope, the number of active rings, the dimensions and the
segmentation of the crystal blocks, the nature of the crystal
(NaI, LSO, BGO), the phantom type and the acquisition mode
(2D or 3D). In addition, users have to provide the energy
resolution measured or estimated at 511 keV which is then
normally scaled according to the energy deposited in the
crystals. For standard conﬁgurations, neither code modiﬁcation
nor recompilation are necessary. For every positron event
and each of its two annihilation photons, GePEToS computes
the deposited energy and an energy-weighted position in the
transverse plane of the crystals which is then used to determine

which crystal was hit. The depth of interaction (DOI) in
crystals is also computed and stored if this readout mode is
selected by users. Hit information is written in ROOT [6]
ﬁles. Sinograms are separately prepared by using a ROOT
application and ﬁnally processed by an IDL program [7] to re-
construct the tomographic images. More complex geometries,
departing from the standard multi-ring crystal block model,
can be handled with minor modiﬁcations of the code and by
rebuilding the application.

IV. VALIDATION TESTS

An exhaustive validation test of GePEToS has been achieved
on one of the most common PET cameras used in medical
examination centers : the Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ PET
scanner [8]. The ECAT EXACT HR+ PET scanner consists
of 32 rings, featuring an internal diameter of 82.7 cm and
spanning 15.2 cm in the axial ﬁeld of view. It is made of
blocks of BGO crystals. Each crystal has a transverse cross-
section of 4 x 4.1 mm2 and is 30 mm long. This device, as
modeled in GePEToS, is presented on ﬁgure 4, prepared for
a 2D acquisition, for which the lead septa have been slid in
front of the crystal rings. Also shown on the picture is one of
the typical water phantoms (Φ=20 cm, L=20 cm) that can be
used in GePEToS to assess the performance of the cameras.
Figure 5 also shows the HR+ scanner but in conﬁguration of
3D acquisition mode, with the septa retracted.

All comparisons of the simulated performance against the
available experimental data [9] do show an excellent agree-
ment. To illustrate this statement, ﬁgure 6 shows the results
for the fraction of scattered coincidences as measured in the
NEMA [10] experimental protocol in 2D and 3D acquisition
modes with 18F. For the scatter fraction evaluation, the phan-
tom which is deﬁned in the NEMA protocol is a water cylinder

(Φ=20 cm, L=20 cm) with three axial 18F-loaded capillaries
placed at the center, at 4 cm and 8 cm in the transaxial plane
of the cylinder. The evaluation of total scatter fraction is given
by this expression :

SFtotal =

Here, SFr0, SFr4 and SFr8 are respectively the scatter
fraction at the center, 4 cm and 8 cm in the phantom. The
value of the transaxial Field Of View (FOV) is taken as 25
cm. The scatter fraction is deﬁned for coincidences included
in the [Emin; 650keV ] energy window.

Figure 7 presents the simulation results for the sensitivity
evaluation. The NEMA protocol for this calculation assumes a
water cylinder ﬁlled with 18F for the phantom. The sensitivity
value is determined by this equation :

Sensi =

(1 − SFtotal)

Ncoinc

the
For low energy cut values (250 keV and 350 keV),
sensitivity is 0.8 % and 0.15 % for 3D and 2D acquisition
mode respectively. These simulation results can be compared
to experimental values [8] which produce 0.8 % in 3D mode
and 0.15 % for a 2D acquisition.

Also presented on ﬁgure 8 is the transaxial image resolution
determined with ﬁve axial 18F-loaded capillaries (ﬁgure 5)
which again shows a good agreement between the simulated
and the experimental data. The results are produced by the
FWHM gaussian ﬁt on the pixel distribution of the recon-
struted image. All quantitative results are reported in the
table II.

V. APPLICATION EXAMPLES

In this section, we brieﬂy describe two application examples
of GePEToS which show that
this simulation framework
although in an infant stage, can be used to investigate a wide
variety of PET problems.

A. A liquid xenon µPET camera

For several years, liquid xenon has been considered by
two groups to build PET cameras [11] [12]. We have used
GePEToS to optimize the design of a small animal µPET
camera which would exclusively use the scintillation light
of LXe. The active part of the camera is a ring featuring
an internal diameter of 10 cm and a radial extension of
approximately 25 mm. It is ﬁlled with liquid xenon and placed
in a cryostat composed of thin aluminum walls (especially
around the imaging port). 16 identical modules of the type
shown on ﬁgure 9, are immersed in this ring. Each module
presents a 2 x 2 cm2 cross-section in the transaxial plane of
the camera. The axial ﬁeld of view spans 5 cm. A module
is optically subdivided by 100 2 x 2 mm2 MgF2-coated
aluminum UV light guides. The UV light is collected on both
sides of a module by two position sensitive photo-tubes. The
(x,y) positions measured by the photo-tubes determine which
light guides have been ﬁred : hence we measure the transaxial
Depth Of Interaction (DOI) of the photons [13]. For each
module, the axial coordinate is provided by the following ratio
of the photo-tube signals :

the light guides. The simulated 18F sensitivity of this device
evaluated on a water cylinder of 4 cm in diameter and 4 cm
in length is 0.6% for an energy threshold of 250 keV. Its
image resolution after ﬁltering is 1.6 mm (FWHM) throughout
the view ﬁeld, thanks to the DOI capability of the device.
Figure 10 shows the reconstructed image of point-like 18F
sources placed in the z=0 transaxial plane of a 4 cm diameter
water cylinder. After ﬁltering, these point-like sources are
clearly resolved. Table III shows the image resolution at
different points in the Field Of View (FOV) for the 18F, 11C
and 15O : we see that the DOI measurements provide a good
resolution uniformity in the FOV.

VI. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES

We have established the basis of a PET simulation package
(GePEToS) based on Geant4 as a transport and tracking
engine. GePEToS has been validated against the available data
of a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+ PET scanner. We used
GePEToS to guide our development effort toward a LXe PET
camera dedicated to the small animal imaging. The sources of
GePEToS can be freely downloaded from this site [16].

axial ﬁeld of a MRI scanner. We found no improvement
for 18F and a marginal gain for 11C. However for 15O
and providing the device is operated in a 15 T solenoidal
ﬁeld, ﬁgures 11 and 12 show that the magnetic ﬁeld allows
to resolve two point-like sources separated by 4 mm. The
physical explanation of this effect is very comparable to what
happens in a TPC (Time Projection Chamber) operated in a
magnetic ﬁeld. The axial magnetic ﬁeld blocks the transaxial
diffusion of electrons and conﬁnes them within a spiral around
their creation points. Our results are in good agreement with
what was found in previous studies [14], [15]. 15 T MRI
scanners are now becoming available for small animals, but
the operation of photo-sensors in such a strong magnetic ﬁeld
remains a very difﬁcult challenge for the future.

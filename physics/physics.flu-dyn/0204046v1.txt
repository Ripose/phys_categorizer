1 Historical remark and Introduction

In 1943-44, von Neumann became convinced that the calculation of the
ﬂows of compressible ﬂuids containing strong shocks could be accomplished
only by numerical methods. He conceived the idea of capturing shocks,
i.e., of ignoring the presence of a discontinuity. Employing a Lagrangian
description of compressible ﬂow, setting heat conduction and viscosity equal
to zero, von Neumann replaced space and time derivatives by symmetric
diﬀerence quotients. Calculations using this scheme were carried out; the
approximation resulting from these calculations (see [8]) showed oscillations
on the mesh scale behind the shock. Von Neumann boldly conjectured
that the oscillations in velocity represent the heat energy created by the
irreversible action of the shock, and that as ∆x and ∆t tend to zero, the
approximate solutions tend in the weak sense to the discontinuous solution
of the equations of compressible ﬂow.

In [5] it was counterconjectured that von Neumann was wrong in his
surmise, i.e., that although the approximate solutions constructed by his

1e-mail: mik radyna@yahoo.com

method do converge weakly, the weak limit fails to satisfy the law of con-
servation of energy.

In [1] J.Goodman and P.Lax investigated von Neumann’s algorithm ap-

plied to the scalar equation

ut + uux = 0

(1)

(it is called the Hopf equation [2]), in the semidiscrete case. Using numer-
ical experimentation and analytical techniques the demonstrated the weak
convergence of the oscillatory approximations, and that the weak limit fails
to satisfy the scalar equation in question.

Von Neumann’s dream of capturing shocks was realized in his joint work
with Richtmyer in 1950, see [9]. Oscillations were eliminated by the judicious
use of artiﬁcial viscosity; solutions constructed by this method converge
uniformly except in a neighborhood of shocks, where they remain bounded
and are spread out over a few mesh intervals. The limits appear to satisfy
the conservation laws of compressible ﬂow. The conservation of mass and
momentum is the consequence of having approximated these equations by
diﬀerence equations in conservation form; but the von Neumann-Richtmyer
diﬀerence approximation to the energy equation is not in conservation form.
In the paper [3] T.Hou and P.Lax compared the results of a von Neumann-
Richtmyer calculation with the weak limit of of calculations performed by
von Neumann’s original method.

The aim of this paper, at ﬁrst, it is to introduce the idea of understanding
of conservation laws; the second is to proposed a numerical method for cal-
culation of hydrodynamic shocks proﬁle without using diﬀerences schemes.
We believe that there is no discontinues in the nature of shocks. Dis-
continues solution of hydrodynamic equations only a rough mathematical
model of shocks. When viscosity is taken into account, for example, the
shocks are seen to be smeared out, so that the pure mathematical surface
of discontinuety are replaced by the thin layers (10−7–10−8 m) in which
pressure, density, temperature and etc. vary rapidly but continuosly (see
Fig.1).

The equations of compressible ﬂow in one space dimension can be written

in the following Lagrangian form:

It is a classical approach. Here u is velocity, p is pressure, v speciﬁc volume,
and e internal energy, connected with p and v via an equation of state. Here
we mostly study the case when the equation of state is given by the γ-law
with γ = 1.4

Substituting that into the (2) we get the following equation

(pv)t + pux = 0.

The ﬁrst equation of (2) is conservation of momentum, the second equation
conservation of mass, the third the work equation.

Figure 1: Steady-state plane shock

We will consider a steady-state shock. Imagine a long pipe containing
a ﬂuid initially in equilibrium (thermally and mechanically), into which a
piston is pushing from one end with constant speed, as shown in Fig.1. In
the presence of dissipation the speciﬁc volume, v, and the ﬂuid velocity, u
are as shown by the curves. Our problem is to calculate the exact shape of
this curves. The shock is steady, at least approximately, after it has gone
to a suﬃciently great distance from the initiating piston. Then u, v, e, etc.
depend on x and t only through the combination y = x
ct, where c is a
speed of the shock relative to the original, or Lagrangian, coordinates.

Now, we are going to study the equations (2) in speciﬁc sense. Namely,

we are going to rewrite mentioned equations in the sense of R

the numerical calculations of the smooth shocks and soliton like solutions
of the Hopf equation and equations of compressible ﬂow in the mentioned
sense. This method based on orthogonal system of the Hermite functions
as a base for calculation of such solutions (i.e. shocks and inﬁnitely narrow
solitons). Calculations of proﬁles of inﬁnitely narrow soliton and shock wave
are reduced to the nonlinear system of algebraic equations in Rn+1, n > 1.
We proved, using the Schauder ﬁxed point theorem [13], that the mentioned
system has at least one solution in Rn+1. We showed that there is possibility
to ﬁnd out some of the solutions of this system using the Newton iteration
method [4]. We considered examples and numerical tests. We also should

3 Conservation laws. Non-Archimedean approach.

A conservation law asserts that the rate of change of the total amount of
substance contained in a ﬁxed domain G is equal to the ﬂux of that substance
across the boundary of G. Denoting the density of that substance by u, and
the ﬂux by f , the conservation law is

Applying the divergence theorem and taking d/dt under the integral sign we
obtain

Dividing by vol (G) and shrinking G to a point where all partial derivatives
of u and f are continuous we obtain the diﬀerential conservation law

Note, that if f (u) = u2/2 then we obtained the Hopf equation (1).

Certainly, one can consider instead of the Hopf equation some conserva-

From mathematical point of view, we deal with a inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable
functions in deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.2, so that we avoid the problem of distri-
bution multiplication. From physical point of view, functions from the set
I or J can describe fast processes. Mathematical models of such processes
based on functions from I or J may give additional information and take in
account a short zone where physical system make a jump from one position
to another.

Thus, we will consider solutions of the Hopf equation which are inﬁnitely

narrow solitons or shock waves. It easy to see that

If we assume that v0 and ∆v are known then we can calculate all con-

We denote by v1 = v0 + ∆v, v1 is a volume before the shock formation.
The quantity η = v1/v0 is a measure of the shock strength. Denote by
p1 = p0 + ∆p, v1 is a normal pressure (it is known, p1 = 1 atm) before the
shock formation. From the (64) we can get

In conclusion we should emphasis that our calculation method looks
like the Fourier method for linear diﬀerential equations but applied to the
nonlinear equations. Our method allowed to obtain all known formulas for
the shocks characteristics and, in addition, ﬁnd a microscopic behaviour of
shocks in the thin layer. According to the our model the pressure in the thin
layer can be negative. It is possible that the concept of “pressure” in the
thin layer (where the jump of p(t, x, ε) took place) one should understand
in special sense. We think that the role of ε in the calculations can play so-
called the average length of free movement of gas molecules. From our point
of view the phenomena of the formation and development of characteristics
of the shock wave should describe in terms of non-Archemedean distance or
non-Archemedean geometry.

21

In addition, we can use Laguerre functions or harmonic functions in our

calculations instead of Hermite functions.

We hope that our approach will be useful for the problems of nonlinear

Optics and problems of Quantum Mechanics.

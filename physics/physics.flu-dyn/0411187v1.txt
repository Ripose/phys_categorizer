(Dated: 11/17/04)

Numerical simulation studies in 2D with the addition of noise are reported for the convection of a
supercritical ﬂuid, 3He, in a Rayleigh-B´enard cell where the ﬂuid parameters and cell height L are the
same as in published laboratory experiments. The noise addition is to accelerate the instability onset

after starting the heat ﬂow across the ﬂuid, so as to bring simulations into better agreement with

experimental observations. Homogeneous temperature noise and spatial lateral periodic temperature

variations in the top plate were programmed into the simulations. A speed-up in the instability onset

was obtained, which was most eﬀective through the spatial temperature variations with a period
of 2L, close to the wavelength of a pair of convections rolls. For a small amplitude of 0.5 µK, this

perturbation gave a semiquantitative agreement with experimental observations. Results for various

noise amplitudes are presented and discussed in relation to predictions by El Khouri and Carl`es.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have presented a comparison of numerical sim-

ulations with experimental data investigating the

transient to steady convection after the start of a
heat current through a supercritical 3He layer in a
RB cell. Here the temperature drop ∆T (t) across

the ﬂuid layer versus time t was studied. The aim

was to understand and to reduce the discrepancy

between experiment and simulations in the time of

the convection development, as detected by ∆T (t).

Simulations for one set of ﬂuid parameters (where

the largest discrepancy had been observed) are re-

ported with imposed temperature variations on the

top plate. Satisfactory results were obtained for spa-

tial lateral temperature variations with an amplitude

1 Introduction

The complex interactions existing between turbulence and mixing in a bluﬀ-
body stabilised ﬂame conﬁguration is investigated by means of a wavelet cross-
correlation analysis on Large Eddy Simulations. The combined approach allows
to better point out typical features of unsteady turbulent ﬂows with mixing
through the characterisation of the processes involved both in time and scales.
The wavelet cross-correlation analysis of the time signals of velocity and mixture
fraction ﬂuctuations can be an an eﬀective tool to study the processes involved
in turbulent mixing ﬂows which are of great interest in combustion problems.

2 Generalities on wavelet cross-correlation

The continuous wavelet transform of a function f (t) is deﬁned as the convolution
between f and a dilated function ψ called wavelet mother:

Wf (a, τ ) =

1

√a Z +∞

−∞

f (t)ψ∗(

t − τ
a

)dt,

(1)

where a is the dilation parameter, which plays the same role as the frequency
in Fourier analysis, and τ indicates the translation parameter corresponding to
the position of the wavelet in the physical space. In the present study we use
the complex Morlet wavelet (ψ(t) = eiω0te−t2/2) as wavelet mother.
Let Wf (a, τ ) and Wg(a, τ ) be the continuous wavelet transforms of f (t) and g(t).
We deﬁne the wavelet cross-scalogram as

Wf g(a, τ ) = W ∗

f (a, τ )Wg(a, τ ),

(2)

2

where the symbol ∗ indicates the complex conjugate. When the wavelet mother
is complex, the wavelet cross-scalogram Wf g(a, τ ) is also complex and can be
written in terms of its real and imaginary parts:

Wf g(a, τ ) = CoWf g(a, τ ) − iQuadWf g(a, τ ).

It can be shown that the following equation holds if f (t), g(t) ∈ L2(ℜ)

Z +∞

−∞

f (t)g(t)dt = 1/cψ Z +∞

where 1/cψ is a constant depending on the choice of the wavelet mother.

3 Cross wavelet coherence functions

The highly redundant information from a multiscale wavelet analysis of time
series must be reduced by means of suitable selective procedures and quantities,
in order to extract the main features correlated to an essentially intermittent
dynamics. In this study, we analysed and compared the properties of two com-
plementary wavelet local correlation coeﬃcents which are able to well evidence
peculiar and anomalous local events associated to the vortex dynamics. More
precisely, given two signals f (t) and g(t), we refer to the so-called Wavelet Local
Correlation Coeﬃcent (Buresti et. al [1]), deﬁned as:

W LCC(a, τ ) =

CoWf g(a, τ )

| Wf (a, τ ) || Wg(a, τ ) |

.

(5)

This quantity is essentially a measure of the phase coherence of the signals. Here
we introduce the Cross Wavelet Coherence Function (CWCF) deﬁned as:

CW CF (a, τ ) =

2 | Wf g(a, τ ) |2

| Wf (a, τ ) |4 + | Wg(a, τ ) |4 ,

(6)

which is essentially a measure of the intensity coherence of the signals. Using
the polar coordinates we can write the wavelet transforms of Wf (a, τ ), Wg(a, τ )
and Wf g(a, τ ) as:

Wf (a, τ ) = ρf eıθf Wg(a, τ ) = ρgeıθg

Wf g(a, τ ) = ρf ρgeı(θg−θf ),

and the Cross Wavelet Coherence Function can be written also as:

CW CF (a, τ ) =

2ρ2
f ρ2
g
ρ4
f + ρ4
g

.

It is easy to observe the two basic properties of the function (6):

CW CF (a, τ ) = 0 =⇒ ρf = 0

or ρg = 0

0 ≤ CW CF ≤ 1

∀ a, τ.

4 Numerical simulation

We considered a laboratory-scale axisymmetric ﬂame of methane-air in a non
conﬁned bluﬀ-body conﬁguration. More precisely, the burner consists of a 5.4
mm diameter methane jet located in the center of a 50 mm diameter cylinder.
Air is supplied through a 100 mm outer diameter coaxial jet around the 50 mm
diameter bluﬀ-body. The Reynolds number of the central jet is 7000 (methane
velocity =21 m/s) whereas the Reynolds number of the coaxial jet is 80000 (air
velocity =25 m/s). This is a challenging test case for all the turbulence models,
as well documented in the ERCOFTAC report (Chatou, 1994) [2]. Moreover, due
to the highly intermittent, unsteady dynamics involved and the high turbulence
level, especially for the reactive case, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) appears
as the most adequate numerical approach (Sello et. al [3]).

5 Results and discussion

In this analysis we are mainly interested to relations existing between evolution
of turbulence and mixing, for the reactive case. Previous DNS simulations on
coaxial jets at diﬀerent Reynolds numbers, show the ability of the wavelet cross-
correlation analysis to better investigate the relations between mixing process
and the dynamics of vorticity (Salvetti et. al [4]). Thus, the signals analysed here
are velocity ﬂuctuations (for Reynolds stress contributions) and mixture fraction
ﬂuctuations (for mixing evolution) from LES. As an example, Figure 1 shows the
wavelet co-spectrum maps for a signiﬁcant time interval in the pseudo-stationary
regime of motion. The main contributions to the Reynolds stress are evidenced
by high intensity correlations (red) and anti-correlations (blue) regions, which
evolve intermittently. The dominant frequencies involved are located around
130 Hz. For the mechanisms responsable of the evolution of mixing, we note
that the same regions of high Reynolds stress correspond to high correlation,
or cooperation, between velocity and mixture fraction ﬂuctuations, suggesting
that, at the selected location, the same events of stretching and tilting of the
vorticity layer, drive both Reynolds stress and mixing evolutions. Note that the
large high value region located at low frequencies in the right map is statistically
not signiﬁcant if we assume a proper red noise background spectrum. To better
investigate the role of the high correlation regions, we performed a cross section
in the wavelet map at the frequency 160 Hz. Figure 2 (left) shows the time
behaviour of the coherence functions WLCC, eq.(5), and CWCF, eq.(6). Here
the phase and intensity coherence of signals are almost equivalent, but we can
clearly point out an important anomalous event occurred at around t=0.19 s,
corresponding to a loss of both intensity and phase coherence, followed by a
change of the correlation sign. The link between this event and the dynamics
of vorticity is evidenced by Figure 2 (right), which displays the wavelet map of
the related vorticity signal. The higher frequency signiﬁcant regions (≈ 730 Hz)
result strongly intermittent, with a bifurcation to lower and higher values than

4

average, followed by a drop of activity, in phase with the anomalous event.

ations (left) and for axial velocity and mixture fraction ﬂuctuations (right) at a
given spatial point near the edge of the central jet.

These few examples support the usefulness of the cross-wavelet analysis ap-

proach to better investigate turbulent mixing processes in real systems.

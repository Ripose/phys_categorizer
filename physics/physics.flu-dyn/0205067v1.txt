We present an experimental study of the motion of a solid sphere falling through a wormlike
micellar ﬂuid. While smaller or lighter spheres quickly reach a terminal velocity, larger or heavier
spheres are found to oscillate in the direction of their falling motion. The onset of this instability
correlates with a critical value of the velocity gradient scale Γc ∼ 1 s−1. We relate this condition to
the known complex rheology of wormlike micellar ﬂuids, and suggest that the unsteady motion of
the sphere is caused by the formation and breaking of ﬂow-induced structures.

A sphere falling through a viscous Newtonian ﬂuid is a
classic problem in ﬂuid dynamics, ﬁrst solved mathemat-
ically by Stokes in 1851 [1]. Stokes provided a formula
for the drag force F experienced by a sphere of radius R
when moving at constant speed V0 though a ﬂuid with
viscosity µ: F = 6πµRV0. The simplicity of the falling
sphere experiment has meant that the viscosity can be
measured directly from the terminal velocity V0, using a
modiﬁed Stokes drag which takes into account wall eﬀects
[2]. The falling sphere experiment has also been used to
study the viscoelastic properties of many polymeric (non-
Newtonian) ﬂuids [3, 4, 5]. In general, a falling sphere
in a non-Newtonian ﬂuid always approaches a terminal
velocity, though sometimes with an oscillating transient
[6, 7, 8]. In this paper we present evidence that a sphere
falling in a wormlike micellar solution does not seem to
approach a steady terminal velocity; instead it undergoes
continual oscillations as it falls, as shown in Fig. 1.

A wormlike micellar ﬂuid is an aqueous solution in
which amphiphilic (surfactant) molecules self-assemble
in the presence of NaSal into long tubelike structures,
or worms [9]; these micelles can sometimes be as long as
1µm [10]. Most wormlike micellar solutions are viscoelas-
tic, and at low shear rates their rheological behavior is
very similar to that of polymer solutions. However, un-
like polymers, which are held together by strong covalent
bonds, the micelles are held together by relatively weak
entropic and screened electrostatic forces, and hence can
break under shear.
In fact, under equilibrium condi-
tions these micelles are constantly breaking and reform-
ing, providing a new mechanism for stress relaxation [11].
The nonlinear rheology of these micellar ﬂuids can be
very diﬀerent from standard polymer solutions [11, 12,
13]. Several observations of new phenomena have been
including shear thickening [14, 15], a stress
reported,
plateau in steady shear rheology [16, 17], and ﬂow in-
stabilities such as shear-banding [18]. Bandyopadhyay et
al. have observed chaotic ﬂuctuations in the stress when
a wormlike micellar solution is subjected to a step shear
rate above a certain critical value (in the plateau region
of stress-shear rate curve) [19]. A shear-induced transi-
tion from an isotropic to a nematic micellar ordering has
also been observed [20].

There is increasing experimental evidence relating the
onset of some of these interesting rheological phenomena
to the formation of mesoscale aggregations, the so-called
“shear-induced structures” (SIS) [13, 21]. These struc-
tures have now been imaged directly in wormlike micellar
ﬂuids using electron microscopy [22]. Recent experiments
have correlated the formation of SIS with the occurence
of shear thickening [15] and shear banding [23]. Also, vi-
sual observations have shown that the growth of SIS is
followed by their tearing or breaking, after which they
grow again [15, 24].

Recently, oscillations in the shape and velocity of a
rising bubble have been observed in the wormlike micel-
lar system cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) /
sodium salicylate (NaSal), for concentrations from 8 - 11
mM [25]. These oscillations occur when the bubble vol-
ume is greater than a certain critical value; small bub-
bles, which remain spherical or ellipsoidal, do not oscil-
late. The bubble develops a cusp as it rises through the
solution. At the moment of cusp formation, the bubble
suddenly “jumps” releasing the cusp. A strong negative
wake [26] is observed behind the bubble after every jump.
Similar dynamics are also observed in other wormlike mi-

cellar systems [27].

The fact that shape oscillations are coupled with the
velocity oscillations of the bubble suggests that the oscil-
lations are caused by surface tension eﬀects. The obser-
vations presented here, that a solid sphere also oscillates
while falling through a CTAB/NaSal solution, indicate
that such oscillations are not due to surface tension or
cusp-like tails [25]. We conjecture that the oscillations
are due to the formation of ﬂow-induced structures in the
combined shear and extensional ﬂow around the sphere.
Experimental Setup and Results. Our study fo-
cuses on the micellar system CTAB/NaSal [15, 16, 28],
one of several aqueous solutions containing the organic
salt sodium salicylate (NaSal), which facilitates the for-
mation of long tubular “wormlike” micelles of cationic
surfactants [29]. The CTAB and NaSal used here are
obtained from Aldrich, and dissolved in distilled deion-
ized water without further puriﬁcation. The ﬂuids are
mixed for several days, then allowed to settle for a day
before use. We restrict our solutions to the molar ratio
1:1 [28], and have found that only for a range of concen-
trations around 10 mM can we obtain a low Reynolds
number ﬂow which is still experimentally convenient to
use. All data presented here are for 9.0 mM equimolar
CTAB/NaSal solutions (except for Fig. 1a, which is for
6.0 mM CTAB/NaSal). At this concentration, the solu-
tion is known to form wormlike micelles [15].

The shear rheology of our ﬂuid was investigated using
a concentric Couette rheometer (Rheometrics RFS III).
The steady state stress is shown as a function of applied
shear rate in Fig. 2. On this log-log plot, a linear slope
is superimposed for comparison - the ﬂuid is clearly non-
Newtonian in shear [5]. Additionally, the ﬂuid shows a
plateau in the stress over a range of shear rates (approx-
imately from 0.2 to 2 s−1), a characteristic of wormlike
micellar ﬂuids [10, 30].

Our experimental setup consists of a tall cylindrical cell
with inner diameter D = 9 cm and length L = 120 cm,

ﬁlled with the experimental ﬂuid. For all of our spheres
d/D ≤ 0.21, where d is the diameter of the sphere. The
cell is enclosed in a 120 cm high box, and recirculat-
ing water in this surrounding volume is used to control
the temperature of the ﬂuid. Our experiments are per-
formed at T = 30.0◦ C. The spheres (made of nylon,
delrin, or teﬂon) are dropped in the center of the tube
using tweezers, and allowed to fall through 10 cm before
data is taken. The ﬂuid was allowed to relax for at least
60 minutes between each drop. The motion of the sphere
is captured by a CCD camera and the movie is stored
digitally in a computer. An in-house image analysis pro-
gram is then used to extract the velocity vs time data of
the falling sphere from the digital images.

While small spheres reach a terminal velocity after
some transient oscillations (Fig. 3a), spheres of larger size
do not seem to approach a terminal velocity - they os-
cillate as they fall (Fig. 3b-d). These oscillations are not
perfectly periodic, displaying some irregularity. However,
an average frequency can be deﬁned as the number of os-
cillations over the entire fall divided by the time taken.
The average frequency of oscillations increases with the
radius or volume of the sphere, as was also observed for
the oscillations of a rising bubble [25]. Although the am-
plitude of these velocity oscillations vary widely for a
given sphere, the oscillations show a common character-
istic of a sudden acceleration and a relatively slower de-
celeration. At the moment of each acceleration, a strong
negative wake [26] is visually observed as a recoil in the
ﬂuid, as if the ﬂuid were letting go of the sphere.

For a sphere of ﬁxed radius, there is a transition to
nontransient oscillations as the density of the sphere is
increased. As seen in Fig. 4, a delrin sphere (density ρ =
1.35 g/cm3) with d = 3/16′′ does not oscillate, however a
teﬂon sphere (ρ = 2.17 g/cm3) of the same diameter does
oscillate. If however the sphere is very large or heavy, it
falls through the ﬂuid very fast, with less well-deﬁned

oscillations (Fig. 3d).

To characterize the onset of these oscillations, we es-
timate the average magnitude of the velocity gradients
Γ using the ratio of the velocity of the sphere to its di-
ameter: Γ = Vb/d, where we take Vb to be the baseline
velocity below the oscillations. For the four experiments
shown in Fig. 3, we ﬁnd Γ ≃ 0.79, 1.05, 1.2, and 4.2 s−1,
respectively. For Fig. 4, we ﬁnd Γ ≃ 0.63, and 1.7 s−1,
respectively. Thus the oscillations appear to start at a
critical value Γc ∼ 1 s−1. Note that this average velocity
gradient corresponds to a shear rate lying in the ‘ﬂat’
region of the shear stress curve (Fig. 2).

Discussion. The ﬁrst observation of nontransient os-
cillations of an object in a wormlike micellar ﬂuid was
made for a rising bubble [25]. The fact that similar os-
cillations are observed for a falling sphere indicates that
the oscillations are not caused by a surface instability.
The sudden acceleration of the sphere during the oscilla-
tions indicates that the drag on the sphere has suddenly
decreased. We hypothesize that this sudden drop in the
drag is due to the breakup of ﬂow-induced structures
(FIS) that are formed in the region around the sphere.

Using small angle light scattering on a CTAB/NaSal
micellar solution in a Couette cell, Liu & Pine found that
once the ﬂuid was subjected to shear rates greater than
a certain critical value, streaks were observed in the scat-
tering intensities, indicating the formation of mesoscale
structures [15]. These elongated structures have a width
∼ 1µm, which is much larger than the diameter of a single
micelle (5 nm) [22]. The appearance of these structures
dramatically increased the apparent viscosity of the ﬂuid
[23], and also made the ﬂuid very elastic. Moreover, the
structures do not appear instantaneously when the ﬂuid
is sheared - they form only after a ﬁnite induction time (∼
seconds). They grow from the stationary cylinder to the
moving cylinder in the Couette cell, but are ripped apart
as they approach the moving surface. The cycle begins
again as the structures start growing from the stationary
cylinder. The process of growing and ripping can be cor-
related to macroscopic stress ﬂuctuations. These experi-
ments suggest that FIS cannot sustain large stresses. Al-
though these observations were made for a low concentra-
tion shear thickening CTAB/NaSal solution, the FIS are

3

believed to form even for higher concentrations; similar
observations of birefringent structures and stress oscilla-
tions were made by Wheeler et al. in 40 mM CPCl/NaSal
[24].

We propose the following picture as a mechanism for
the oscillations:
if a sphere falls fast enough through a
wormlike micellar ﬂuid, FIS are formed around the sphere
which increase the eﬀective viscosity, and thus the drag.
However, when the stress around the sphere reaches a
large enough value, these structures break and the ﬂuid in
the wake of the sphere recoils. This causes a sudden drop
in the drag experienced by the sphere, which suddenly
accelerates. Once the sphere moves into fresh ﬂuid, FIS
start forming again, repeating the cycle.

The apparent critical velocity gradient Γc required for
the onset of oscillations of a falling sphere indicates a crit-
ical gradient required for the formation of the FIS. Since
the formation of these structures is not a regular, peri-
odic process [15, 24], there are ﬂuctuations in the drag
experienced by the sphere, which would cause irregular
oscillations. This would also explain why small spheres
(and small bubbles) do not oscillate: the lower terminal
velocity does not shear or stretch the ﬂuid enough to pro-
duce the structures. Eﬀectively, lighter spheres move in
a more uniform ﬂuid than spheres of moderate weight.

On the other hand, very heavy spheres do not seem to
have well deﬁned oscillations (see Fig. 3d). This could
be an eﬀect of the inertia of the sphere. It could also be
due to the time needed to form shear-induced structures
[14, 24].
If the sphere is heavy its average velocity is
suﬃciently high and it moves into fresh ﬂuid while the
structures are still forming.

According to our interpretation, the large negative
wake behind the sphere seen after every “jump” would
be due to the shedding of these FIS. The onset of oscilla-
tions in the bubbles at the formation of a cusp indicates
that the surrounding ﬂuid is unable to support the high
stresses required to form the cusp. When the ﬂow around
the bubble induces the bubble to form a cusp, the stress
becomes large enough to break the FIS, which are subse-
quently shed. The shedding is seen as a strong negative
wake behind the bubble [25]. This explanation also en-
ables us to make a prediction: every cusped bubble in a
micellar ﬂuid which allows for FIS should oscillate. Ex-
periments with bubbles in our CTAB/NaSal solution are
consistent with this prediction.

Conclusions. A sphere falling in a viscous Newtonian
ﬂuid reaches a steady terminal velocity; the approach to
this terminal velocity can be shown to be monotone [31],
In polymeric ﬂuids, a
in agreement with observations.
ﬁnal steady state is also always observed experimentally.
In this paper we have shown that the unusual behavior
seen in the ﬂow of wormlike micellar solutions extends to
the classic problem of ﬂow past a sphere.

We believe that the nontransient oscillations of the
falling sphere are caused by the formation of ﬂow-induced
structures. While the rheology of wormlike micellar ﬂu-
ids has typically focused on either pure shear ﬂow [29, 30]

4

or pure extensional ﬂow [32], the velocity ﬁeld produced
by a falling sphere is more complicated: the ﬂuid near
the surface is being sheared, whereas in the wake the
ﬂuid is primarily under extensional ﬂow. It is thus not
what is called a viscometric ﬂow [5]. Recently some in-
direct evidence has been seen of structures produced by
extensional ﬂows [33]. The observations presented here
may be an example of the dynamics of these ﬂow-induced
structures in a complicated hydrodynamic ﬂow.

Analyzing this problem certainly presents a challenge,
and mathematical modeling will probably require full
scale numerical simulations. Numerical studies of the
transient motion of a falling sphere have only recently
been undertaken even for polymer ﬂuids (see e.g. [7] and
references therein). The constitutive equation chosen to
model our experiment should give a good ﬁt to both the
shear stress and the extensional ﬂow data, and in addi-
tion include the as yet unknown property which produces
nontransient oscillations.

The shear-stress ﬂow curve for our wormlike micellar
ﬂuid displays a ﬂat region (see Fig. 2), which is believed
to be a manifestation of a theoretical non-monotone

stress-shear rate relation [12, 34].
It is well known
that steady-shear ﬂow in the decreasing region of a non-
monotonic ﬂow curve is unstable (it is ill-posed in the
Hadamard sense [35]). Such an instability has been at-
tributed to cause diﬀerent physical eﬀects such as shear-
banding in micellar solutions [36], and the shark-skin [35]
and spurt [37] instabilities in polymer melts. Heuristi-
cally, the onset of oscillations of a falling sphere could be
due to the same instability. The fact that the average
shear rate at onset of oscillations sits in the ﬂat region of
the shear stress curve supports this conjecture. To test
this further one should choose a constitutive equation
which displays a non-monotonic ﬂow curve (for instance
the Johnson-Segalman equation [34, 38]) and simulate
the falling sphere problem. Such a simulation is currently
in progress.

In this paper the issue of the determination of the ﬂuid pressure in incompressible ﬂuids is ad-
dressed, with particular reference to the search of algorithms which permit to advance in time the
ﬂuid pressure without actually solving numerically the Poisson equation. Based on an inverse kinetic
approach recently proposed for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations we intend to prove that
an exact evolution equation can be obtained which advances in time self-consistently the ﬂuid pres-
sure. The new equation is susceptible of numerical implementation in Lagrangian CFD simulation
codes.

An important aspect of computational ﬂuid dynam-
ics is related to the determination of the ﬂuid pressure
in isothermal incompressible ﬂuids and particularly to
the construction of an exact evolution equation for the
ﬂuid pressure which replaces the Poisson equation. This
amounts to transform an elliptic type ﬂuid equation into
a suitable hyperbolic equation, a result which usually is
reached only by means of an asymptotic formulation. In
this paper we intend to show that an exact solution to
this problem is possible when the evolution of the ﬂuid
ﬁelds is described by means of a suitable dynamical sys-
tem, to be identiﬁed with the so-called Navier-Stokes
(N-S) dynamical system [1]. Besides being a still un-
solved mathematical problem, the issue is relevant for at
least two reasons: a) the proliferation of numerical algo-
rithms in computational ﬂuid dynamics which reproduce
the behavior of incompressible ﬂuids only in an asymp-
totic sense (see below); b) the possible veriﬁcation of con-
jectures involving the validity of appropriate equations
of state for the ﬂuid pressure. Another possible motiva-
tion is, of course, the ongoing quest for eﬃcient numer-
ical solution methods to be applied for the construction
the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρ, V,p} , solutions of the initial and
of
boundary-value problem associated to the incompressible
N-S equations (INSE). For deﬁniteness, it is convenient
to recall that this is deﬁned by the continuity, N-S and
isochoricity equations

∇ · V = 0,

where the mass density ρ and the ﬂuid pressure p are
required to satisfy the inequalities

a suitably smooth volume force density acting on the ﬂuid
element, ρo is the constant mass density and µ > 0 is the
constant ﬂuid viscosity. Equations (1)-(4) are assumed
to admit strong solutions in an open set Ω × I, with
Ω ⊆ R3 the conﬁgurations space (deﬁned as the subset
of R3 where ρ(r,t) > 0) and I ⊂ R a possibly bounded
time interval. By assumption {ρ, V,p} are continuous in
the closure Ω. Hence if in Ω × I, f is at least C(1,0)(Ω ×
I), it follows necessarily that {ρ, V,p} must be at least
C(2,1)(Ω × I), while the ﬂuid pressure and velocity must
satisfy respectively the Poisson and energy equations

∇2p = −▽ · f −ρ∇· (V · ∇V) ,

V·N V = 0.

It is well known that the choice of the Poisson solver
results important in numerical simulations, since its eﬃ-
cient numerical solution depends critically on the num-
ber of modes or mesh points used for its discretization
[2] (see also Ref.[3] and references therein indicated). In
turbulent ﬂows this number can become so large to ef-
fectively limit the size of direct numerical simulations
(DNS) [4]. This phenomenon may be worsened by the
algorithmic complexity of the numerical solution meth-
ods adopted for the Poisson equation. For this reason
previously several alternative approaches have been de-
vised which permit to advance in time the ﬂuid pressure
without actually solving numerically the Poisson equa-
tion. Some of these methods are asymptotic, i.e., to ad-
vance in time the ﬂuid pressure they replace the exact
Poisson equation with suitable algorithms or equations
which hold only in an asymptotic sense (neglecting suit-
ably small corrections), others are exact solvers, i.e., pro-
vide in principle rigorous solutions of INSE (and Poisson
equation). The ﬁrst category includes the pressure-based
method (PBM) [5], the Chorin artiﬁcial compressibility

method (ACM) [6], the so-called preconditioning tech-
niques [? ], all based on ACM, and kinetic approaches,
of which a notable example is provided by the so-called
Lattice-Boltzmann (L-B) methods (for a review see for
example Ref.[11] and references therein indicated). PBM
is an iterative approach and one of the most widely used
Its basic idea is to formulate
for incompressible ﬂows.
a Poisson equation for pressure corrections, and then
to update the pressure and velocity ﬁelds until the iso-
choricity condition (2) is satisﬁed in a suitable asymp-
totic sense. The ACM approach and the related precon-
ditioning techniques, instead, are obtained by replacing
the Poisson and N-S equations with suitable parameter-
dependent evolution equations, assuming that the ﬂuid
ﬁelds depend on a ﬁctitious pseudo-time variable τ . In
dimensionless form the evolution equation for the pres-
∂τ p + ∇ · V =0, where
sure becomes in such a case ε2 ∂
ε2 > 0 is an inﬁnitesimal parameter. Manifestly this
equation recovers only asymptotically, i.e., for ε2 → 0,
the exact isochoricity condition (2). Introducing the fast
variable τ ≡ τ /ε2, this implies that the ﬂuid ﬁelds must
be of the form V(r, t, τ ), p(r, t, τ ) and should be assumed
suitable smooth functions of τ . Therefore, for prescribed
ﬁnite values of ε2 ( to be assumed suitably small), this
equation permits to obtain also an asymptotic estimate
for the ﬂuid pressure p(r, t). This is expressed by the
equation

p(r, t) = lim

where τ ∗ >> 1 is suitably deﬁned and p(r, t, τ = 0) de-
notes some initial estimate for the ﬂuid pressure. Several
implementations on the Chorin algorithm are known in
the literature (see for example Refs.[7, 8, 9, 10]). Cus-
tomary L-B methods are asymptotic too since they re-
cover INSE only in an approximate sense; moreover typ-
ically they rely on the introduction of an equation of
state for the ﬂuid pressure, for example, the equation
of state of an ideal gas, or more reﬁned models based
on so-called non-ideal ﬂuids [12]. This assumption, how-
ever, generally requires that the eﬀective Mach-number
characterizing the L-B approach, deﬁned by the ratio
M ef f = V sup/c (with c denoting the discretized veloc-
ity of the test particles and V sup the sup of the velocity
ﬁeld at time t), must result suitably small. As a con-
sequence, in typical L-B approaches the ﬂuid pressure
can only be estimated asymptotically. However, there
are other numerical approaches which in principle pro-
vide exact Poisson solvers. These include the so-called
spectral methods in which the ﬂuid ﬁelds are expanded
in terms of suitable basis functions. Signiﬁcant exam-
ples are the pure spectral Galerkin and Fourier methods
[13] as well as the nonlinear Galerkin method [14], which

2

are typically adopted for large-scale turbulence simula-
tions. In these methods the construction of solution of
the Poisson equation is obtained analytically. However,
the series-representation of the ﬂuid ﬁelds makes diﬃ-
cult the investigation of the qualitative properties of the
solutions, such - for example - the search of a possible
equation of state or an evolution equation for the ﬂuid
pressure.

Another approach which provides in principle an ex-
act Poisson solver is the one recently proposed by Ellero
and Tessarotto [1, 4], based on an inverse kinetic theory
for INSE. This approach, recently applied also to quan-
tum hydrodynamic equations [15], permits to represent
the ﬂuid ﬁelds as moments of a suitably smooth kinetic
distribution function f (x, t) which obeys an appropriate
inverse Vlasov-type kinetic equation:

Here X(x, t) ≡ {v, F} and x = (r, v) ∈Γ ⊆ Ω × R3 is
the state vector generated by the vector ﬁeld X, v is the
kinetic velocity, while F(x,t) is an appropriate mean-ﬁeld
force obtained in Ref.[1].
[16, 17], it has been
proven that F(x,t) can be uniquely prescribed, in partic-
ular, in such a way that:

An interesting issue is related to the consequences of
the constitutive equation (10) and of the N-S dynamical
system generated by the initial value-problem (9).
In
this Letter we intend to prove that the ﬂuid pressure
p(r, t) obeys an exact partial-diﬀerential equation which
uniquely determines is time evolution. This is obtained
by evaluating its Lagrangian derivative along an arbi-
trary conﬁguration-space Lagrangian trajectory {r(t)}
generated by the N-S dynamical system. The result can
be stated as follows.

Assuming that the initial-boundary value problem asso-
ciated to INSE admits a suitably strong solution {ρ, V,p}
in the set Ω × I, the following statements hold:
A) If x(t) is a particular solution of Eq.

(9) which

space Lagrangian trajectory {x(t)} deﬁned by Eq.

while all quantities ( u, E and p1) are evaluated along an

PROOF
Let us ﬁrst prove statement A), namely that INSE and
the N-S dynamical system imply necessarily the validity
of Eq.(12). For this purpose we ﬁrst notice that by con-
struction Eq.(9) admits a unique solution x(t) for arbi-
trary initial conditions xo = (ro, v
o) ∈ Γ, while the same
equation can also be expressed in terms of the relative
velocity u= v − V(r,t). This yields

As a consequence of the isochoricity condition (2) this
equation reduces identically (i.e., for arbitrary initial con-
ditions for the dynamical system) to Eq.(12). B) Vice
versa, let us assume that the solutions x(t)=(r(t), v(t))
and ξ(t) of Eqs.(9), (12) are known for arbitrary initial
conditions xo ∈ Γ and ξo =
2p1(ro,to) . In this case it
follows the ﬂuid ﬁelds necessarily must satisfy INSE in
the whole set Ω × I. It suﬃces, in fact, to notice that
by assumption the evolution operator Tt,to is known.
This permits to determine uniquely the kinetic distri-
bution function at time t, which reads [1] f (x(t), t) =
f (xo, to)/J(x(t), t), where J(x(t), t) is the Jacobian of
the ﬂow xo → x(t). Hence, also its moments are uniquely
prescribed, including both V(r,t) and p(r,t), in such a
way that they result at least C(2,1)(Ω × I). The inverse
kinetic equation (8), thanks to the special form of F as
given by Eq. (11) ensures that the N-S equation is sat-
isﬁed identically in Ω × I [1]. Moreover, since Eqs. (13)
and (15) are by assumption fulﬁlled simultaneously, it
follows that both the isochoricity condition (2) and the
Poisson equation [Eq.(5)] must be satisﬁed too in Ω × I.
This completes the proof.

As a basic implication, if the ﬂuid velocity is assumed
to satisfy both the N-S equation and isochoricity con-
dition, the mass density satisﬁes the incompressibility
condition (4), while {x(t)} is an arbitrary trajectory of

the N-S dynamical system, it follows that Eq.(12) deter-
mines uniquely the time-advancement of the ﬂuid pres-
sure. Hence, it provides an evolution equation for the
ﬂuid pressure, which by deﬁnition is equivalent simul-
taneously to the isochoricity condition and to the Pois-
son equation. This equation can in principle be used
to determine the ﬂuid pressure at an arbitrary position
r ∈ Ω. However, since any given position can be reached
by inﬁnite phase-space (and also conﬁguration-space) La-
grangian trajectories, it is suﬃcient to sample the conﬁg-
uration space by a suitable subset of Lagrangian trajec-
tories (test particles), obtained by prescribing the initial
condition xo.

The physical interpretation of the pressure evolution
equation is elementary: it yields an unique prescription
for the Lagrangian time derivative of the ﬂuid pressure,
which is deﬁned in the frame which is locally co-moving
with a test particle of state x(t) and velocity v(t).In par-
ticular, it is obvious that the speciﬁcation of the initial
kinetic velocity vo remains essentially arbitrary, as well
as the deﬁnition of the reduced pressure po(t). This
means that both the dimensionless ratios MV = V / |vo|
and Mp = p/po, to be denoted as velocity and pressure ef-
fective Mach numbers, remain essentially arbitrary. As
a consequence it is possible, in principle, to construct
asymptotic solutions of Eq.(12) based on low eﬀective-
Mach numbers expansions, i.e., for which MV , Mp ≪ 1.
As an illustration, let us prove that an approximate so-
lution of this type can be obtained for p1 (and hence
for p) in the so-called diﬀusive approximation, i.e., by
considering a subset of velocity space in which by as-
sumption at time to the initial relative velocity |u|to
and the relative kinetic energy E =ρou2/2 are assumed
to satisfy the Mach-number orderings MV ∼ O(δ) and
Mp ∼ O(δ0), being δ ≪ 1. These imply E

which delivers an equation for p1(t). We stress that these
features are potentially important for the construction of
possible numerical algorithms based on Eq.(12). There-
fore, the pressure evolution equation can in principle be
adopted for the development of Lagrangian particle sim-
ulation methods in ﬂuid dynamics. These developments
will be the object of future investigations.

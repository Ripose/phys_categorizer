Abstract

The vortex ﬁlament equations (VFE) in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions are considered.
Some of these equations are integrable. Also the VFE with potentials and with self-
consistent potentials are presented. Finally several examples of integrable dispersionless
VFE (dVFE) are considered.

1 Introduction

The vortex ﬁlament equation (VFE) has the form

where γ(s, t) denotes the position of the vortex ﬁlament in R3 with t and s being the time
and the arclength parameter respectively. Sometimes we use the following standard form
of the VFE

γst = γs

γt = γs

which follows from (1a). Hence we obtain

Here k and τ respectively denote the curvature and the torsion along γ. In this paper
we consider some dispersionful and dispersionless VFE in 1+1 and 2+1. Some of these
equaions are integrable. Some properties of the VFE from the the various points of view
were studied in [1-42].

2 Integrable VFE in 1+1

First in this section we consider the some well-known (1+1)-dimensional isotropic and
anisotropic VFE. Some examples as follows.
a) The anisotropic VFE. It has the form

×
where V is the vector function. As well-known this equation is integrable in the following
cases:

γt = γs

γss + V,

1) For the case V = 0.

or

where A = diag(A1, A2, A3), Ak = const.
b) The isotropic VFE. It looks like

3 VFE with the potentials

One of interesting generalizations of the VFE (1) are the VFE with potentials. May be
the simplest example of the such equations is the following anisotropic Myrzakulov LV
(M-LV) equation

In this section we present some VFE with the self-consistent potentials. Some of these
equations are integrable, e.g. the Myrzakulov XXXIV equation, shortly, the M-XXXIV

5 VFE with the electromagnetic interaction

One of interesting problem is the interaction between the vortex ﬁlament and the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. In theory, this interaction describes by the coupled system of the VFE
and the Maxwell equations. In the soliton limit, hence, we get the coupled system of the
VFE and the Schrodinger-type equation. As example, we consider the following system
of the coupled equations

6 Integrable VFE in 2+1

It is well-known that each (1+1)-dimensional integrable systems admits several (not one)
integrable (and not integrable) systems in 2+1 dimensions. In the previous sections we
presented some examples integrable and nonintegrable VFE in 1+1 dimensions. In this
section we consider the several VFE in 2+1 dimensions which are the (2+1)-dimensional
integrable extensions of the VFE (1) or (4). Some examples as follows.

i) The anisotropic (2+1)-dimensional VFE.

Hence we obtain the well-known isotropic version which has the form

Finally we note that all of these (2+1)-dimensional VFE are integrable. And in 1+1
dimensions they reduce to the VFE (1) or (4). Of course, there are exist also some
nonintegrable (2+1)-dimensional extensions of the VFE (1) or (4). One of such extensions
has the form

In this section we present some planar ﬁlament equations. Here γ(s, t) denotes an evolving
planar curve, parametrized by arclength s, k is its curvature. Such equations have been
studied from the diﬀerent point of views (see, for example, Ref. [27]).
Example 1. First we consider the following planar VFE [26-27]

8 Integrable dispersionless VFE

A considerable interest has been paid recently to dispersionless or quasi-classical limits
of integrable equations and hierarchies. Study of dispersionless hierarchies is of great
importance since they arise in the analysis of various problems in physics, mathematics
and applied mathematics from the theory of quantum ﬁelds and strings to the theory of
conformal maps on the complex plane.

Above we presented some despersionful VFE. Now we want present some examples
integrable dispersionless VFE (dVFE) in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. For simplicity, we
consider only the planar dVFE.

Example 1. Simplest example integrable dVFE reads as

It is the Myrzakulov XCVIII equation [44]. As well-known it is L-equivalent to the
dispersionless KdV (dKdV) equation (or the Riemann equation)

integrable dispersionless spin systems (see, e.g. Ref. [43]).

9 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented some dispersionful and dispersionless VFE in 1+1 and 2+1
dimensions. Some of these equations are integrable. All of these equations admit diﬀerent
types exact solutions like solitons, knotes, breaking waves, etc. It is of great interest to
study such solutions of the VFE in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions and their integrability. We
are currently investigating this issue and our ﬁnding will appear in a future paper.

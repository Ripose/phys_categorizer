Abstract

In this work a ﬁnite element simulation of the motion of a rigid body in a ﬂuid, with
free surface, is described. A completely general referential description (of which both
Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are special cases) of an incompressible, New-
tonian ﬂuid is used. Such a description enables a distorting ﬁnite element mesh to
be used for the deforming ﬂuid domain.

A new scheme for the linearised approximation of the convective term is proposed
and the improved, second order accuracy of this scheme is proved. A second theo-
rem, which provides a guideline for the artiﬁcial adjustment of the Reynolds number
when applying a continuation technique, is also proved. The most eﬀective means
of eliminating pressure as a variable and enforcing incompressibility are reviewed.
A somewhat novel method to generate ﬁnite element meshes automatically about
included rigid bodies, and which involves ﬁnite element mappings, is described.

The approach taken when approximating the free surface, is that it may be treated as
a material entity, that is, the material derivative of the free surface is assumed zero.
Euler’s equations and conservation of linear momentum are used to determine the
motion of the rigid body. A predictor–corrector method is used to solve the combined
sub–problems. The resulting model is tested in the context of a driven cavity ﬂow,
a driven cavity ﬂow with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem, and a
Stokes second order wave.

Keywords: rigid body in a ﬂuid; free surface; incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid; completely

1 Introduction

An enormous diversity of problems subscribe to the basic rigid body–ﬂuid–free surface
theme (see Figure 1 for a schematic form of the problem of interest). The implications
of free surfaces and ﬂuid–rigid body interactions are a deforming ﬂuid domain and the
implementation of the majority of numerical time integration schemes then becomes prob-
lematic where a purely Eulerian description of the ﬂuid motion has been used. The reason
is that most numerical time integration schemes require successive function evaluation
at ﬁxed spatial locations. Meshes rapidly snarl when purely Lagrangian descriptions are
used.

One alternative is to use the completely general referential description proposed in
Childs [3]. Eulerian and Lagrangian references are just two, speciﬁc examples of an
inﬁnite number of conﬁgurations over which to deﬁne the ﬁelds used to describe the dy-
namics of deforming continua. They are both special cases of a more general referential
description, a description in which a reference conﬁguration is chosen at will (closely
related to the so–called arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method or A.L.E. method). The
completely general referential description is implemented in this work.

Solving for the orientation and position of a rigid body entails solving equations of motion.
These are derived from the principles of conservation of angular and linear momentum.
Expressing the principle of conservation of angular momentum in more usable terms is
not as straight forward as the linear momentum case, and a more appropriate reference
must be resorted to. This reference is ﬁxed within the rigid body in such a way that
the origin and centre of mass coincide, as do the axes and principal moments of inertia.
A complete transformation of all quantities, to this more appropriate reference, is used.

This is in contrast to the approach used in deriving the ﬂuid equations, where quantities
are not perceived in terms of the new reference, but instead merely deﬁned to be functions
of it. The change of reference is accomplished using a transition matrix and the Coriolis
theorem.

The approach taken when approximating the free surface, is that it may be treated as a
material entity i.e. the material derivative of the free surface is assumed zero. Surface
tension is not considered signiﬁcant in the free surfaces investigated.

A predictor–corrector method is used to solve the combined rigid body, ﬂuid and free
surface sub–problems. A backward diﬀerence scheme is used to approximate the time
derivative in the ﬂuid sub–problem (in this regard see Childs [3]). The ﬁnite element
method is used for the spatial (referential “space”) discretisation. Nonlinearity is cir-
cumvented by way of a new second order accurate linearisation, and the use of Picard
iteration if necessary. Picard iteration amounts to “linearising” the non–linear term with
the solution obtained during the previous iterate. A penalty method is used to eliminate
pressure as a variable and a Q2–P1 element pair is used as a basis. A somewhat novel
method to generate ﬁnite element meshes automatically about included rigid bodies, and
which involves ﬁnite element mappings, is described.

The more conventional methods for solving initial value problems are used to solve for the
position and orientation of the rigid body. The deﬁnitions of linear and angular velocity
are coupled to the equations of motion to produce a system of twelve equations (which
are of course also coupled to the ﬂuid equations) and a Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method
is then used. A backward diﬀerence scheme and the ﬁnite element method are used for
the respective temporal and spatial discretisations in the free surface sub–problem.

The overall model was tested in the context of a driven cavity ﬂow, a driven cavity ﬂow
with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem and a Stokes, second–order wave.
Results for these examples are presented in Section 9. The programme was written by
the author in Fortran and originally run on a model 400 Dec Alpha 3100.

2 The Equations Governing the Motion of the Rigid

Body

What follows is a brief exposition of the equations of motion. This is, of course, review of
classical work contained in a great variety of references. Its inclusion is deemed appropri-
ate not for the sake of completeness alone, but because Euler’s equations (the equations
governing the angular motion) and the equations governing the translation are written
in terms of two distinctly diﬀerent references.

The equations of motion, six in all, are essentially an explicit re–write of the principles
of linear and angular momentum. The equations which govern the translation,

dt

=

Σf ,

1
m

4

S.J. Childs, B.D. Reddy

need no introduction, they being a straight forward statement of the principle of conser-
vation of linear momentum. In the above equation vrb denotes the velocity of the rigid
body, m denotes the mass, Σf is the sum of the external forces acting on the rigid body
and t denotes time. Expressing the angular momentum equations in a more practica-
ble form is not as straight forward and necessitates the change to the reference already
mentioned. The conservation principle of angular momentum may be stated as

dˆq
dt

= Σ(ˆr ∧ ˆf )†

(1)

where ˆq is the angular momentum and Σ(ˆr ∧ ˆf ) is the sum of the torques which arise as
a result of the external forces acting about the centre of mass (ˆr is the position vector
of a material point within the rigid body and ˆf is the force). The equations for the
conservation of angular momentum, though easily understood, are not of much use when
stated in the above form.

A More Appropriate Reference

The fact that

for a reference whose origin coincides with the centre of mass (Ωrb is the rigid body
domain depicted in Fig. 2) immediately suggests the existence of a more appropriate
reference than the one in terms of which the above conservation principle is written. For
such a reference ﬁxed within the rigid body,

ρr dΩrb = 0

in addition. This suggests expressing

ˆq =

is obtained, where ω is the angular velocity. It is then a fairly elementary exercise to

that the origin, o, and centre of mass coincide as do the basis vectors and the principal
moments of inertia.

Exploring this idea of a more appropriate reference further and restricting it to one, ﬁnal
choice allows still greater simpliﬁcation; by specifying the basis vectors to coincide with
the eigenvectors of the inertia matrix J (R) (i.e. the basis vectors are principal axes),

This description is in terms of a reference embedded within the rigid body in such a way

on the rigid body.

3 A Free Surface Description Ignoring Surface Ten-

sion

It is assumed that the vertical position of the free surface can be written as a function
of horizontal coordinates and time, that is, x3 = h(x1, x2, t). The free surface can be
described equivalently by the condition

η(x, t) ≡ h(x1, x2, t) − x3 = 0.

Requiring that the material derivative of this free surface to be zero amounts to writing

∂h
∂t

+ ∇h · [v1, v2] = v3.

(4)

A physical interpretation of this mathematics is that the free surface is an inﬁnitesimally
thin, perfectly elastic skin by which the ﬂuid is contained. The free surface is in actuality
not a distinct material entity. The approach is consequently slightly limited. For example,
no convection of the free surface is allowed. Restricting the movement of surface nodes
to vertical translations alone circumvents having to rewrite the above equations in terms
of a completely general referential description.

The variational equations are obtained in the usual manner. Multiplying by an arbitrary
function w and integrating, the equations

are obtained.

Equation (4) is hyperbolic and one would therefore anticipate discontinuities or shocks
in the solution. A standard Galerkin type formulation is not suﬃcient (see Hughes [6],
Hughes, Mallet and Mizukami [7] and Johnson [8]) under such circumstances.

. . . Rigid Body in a Fluid . . .

The Streamline–Upwind–Petrov–Galerkin (S.U.P.G.) Method with discontinuity captur-
ing is one popular method resorted to when solving hyperbolic equations. This amounts
to using

w = w∗ + τ1(∇w∗ · v) + τ2(∇w∗ · vtangent),

vtangent =

v · ∇h
|| ∇h ||2 ∇h,

where w∗ is the arbitrary function in the formulation, τ1 and τ2 are constants described
in Hughes, Mallet and Mizukami [7].

Hermite elements are one more way in which to obtain smoother surfaces. Hermite
elements are used for C 1 approximations which require non–zero ﬁrst order derivatives
at the nodes.

Remark: Although surface tension is not considered signiﬁcant in the free surfaces to
be described in this work, the free surface equations to be used under such circumstances
would be

where the left hand side is the total traction (the diﬀerence between that acting from

curvature

4 A Completely General Referential Description of

an Incompressible, Newtonian Fluid

The implications of free surfaces and ﬂuid–rigid body interactions are a deforming ﬂuid
domain and the implementation of the majority of numerical time integration schemes
then becomes problematic where a purely Eulerian description of the ﬂuid motion has
been used. The reason is that most numerical time integration schemes require succes-
sive function evaluation at ﬁxed spatial locations. Meshes rapidly snarl when purely
Lagrangian descriptions are used. One alternative is to use a completely general referen-
tial description.

The transformation to the completely general reference only involves coordinates where
used as spatial variables and the resultant description is therefore inertial in the same
way as Lagrangian descriptions are. The conservation principles of mass and linear
momentum remain the basis of the ﬂuid model despite having resorted to a completely
general reference (as opposed to a conventional Eulerian reference) for the description of
the ﬂuid. For the purposes of reading the equations which folow some slightly specialised
notation will be introduced.

problem in question.

6 Approximate Fluid Equation and its Implementa-

tion

Two topics which are relevant to the approximate ﬂuid equation are dealing with the
nonlinearity of the convective term and enforcing incompressibility in such a way as to
eliminate pressure as a variable. Only against such a background can the approximate
ﬂuid equation be written.

6.1 The Incompressibility Condition

Two methods to enforce incompressibility and eliminate pressure as a variable are consid-
ered relevant for review. The use of either a penalty method or an iterative, augmented
Lagrangian method both have distinct, yet diﬀerent advantages.

The L.B.B. or B.B. condition (so named after Ladyzhenskaya, Babuˇska and Brezzi) must
be taken into account in the implementation of either method. So–called “locking” or
“chequerboard” modes can arise in the event of the L.B.B. condition not being satisﬁed.
Work by authors such as Oden, Kikuchi and Song [13] can be referred to for a more
in-depth treatment of the L.B.B. condition.

A penalty method was used to eliminate pressure as a variable and enforce incompress-
ibility in later examples, despite the acclaimed superiority of the iterative augmented
Lagrangian approach (discussed shortly). The results obtained using the more eﬃcient
and more easily implemented penalty method compared favourably with those obtained
by Simo and Armero [15], who used the iterative augmented Lagrangian approach.
In other examples the penalty method was used for reasons of standardisation (so that
results could be compared against those cited in the literature).

The Simple Penalty Method

Penalty methods are closely related to the artiﬁcial compressibility method and provide
a remarkably simple strategy for solving the equations. A fundamental assumption made
in using the penalty method is that the incompressibility condition,

can be replaced by one of small incompressibility,

div v = 0,

div v = −ǫp,

where ǫ is small. (It is tempting to substitute this expression for p in the momentum
equations immediately, thereby eliminating the pressure from the equations altogether

12

S.J. Childs, B.D. Reddy

at an analytic stage and prior to construction. This would circumvent the complicated
construction which otherwise results. If such an approach were to be taken, however, the
L.B.B. condition would not be satisﬁed and an appropriate underintegration rule would
then be necessary to avoid an approximation which will lead to “locking” or “chequer
board” modes.)

The corresponding variational, small incompressibility is

q div vdΩ = −ǫ

qpdΩ

ZΩ

ZΩ

where q is the arbitrary function of the variational formulation. A well known shortcoming
of penalty methods is the severe ill–conditioning which occurs as the penalty parameter
is decreased, making the simulation of exact incompressibility practically impossible. As
the theoretical limit ǫ = 0, an inﬁnite condition number for the discrete algebraic sys-
tem is obtained. Despite this shortcoming a straight forward penalty method provides
a remarkably easy–to–implement means of enforcing incompressibility and eliminating
pressure as a variable, furthermore, there was no discernable diﬀerence between results
obtained using the penalty method and those obtained using the iterative augmented La-
grangian approach for the driven cavity ﬂow problem (compare the results in Subsection
9.1 with those obtained by Simo and Armero [15]).

An Iterative Augmented Lagrangian Approach for Enforcing Exact Incom-
pressibility

There is considerable merit in the iterative augmented Lagrangian approach from the
point of view of realising theory. Incompressibility can be exactly enforced (to within a
speciﬁed tolerance) for ﬁnite values of the penalty parameter using an iterative augmented
Lagrangian approach. This is in contrast to conventional penalty formulations where
there is a trade–oﬀ between enforcing exact incompressibility and obtaining a severely
ill–conditioned algebraic system.

A fundamental assumption made in using the iterative augmented Lagrangian method
is that the incompressibility condition can be replaced by one of iterative, limiting–case
incompressibility,

for ǫ small.

div v = −ǫ

p(k+1) − p(k)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The method of augmented Lagrangians provides an eﬀective means to circumvent the
shortcomings of the simple penalty method and enables the divergence free constraint to
be exactly enforced for ﬁnite values of the penalty parameter.

6.2 A New, Linear Scheme for the Approximation of the Con-

vective Term

The following theorem is the ﬁrst of two proposed numerical improvements (originally
presented in Childs and Reddy [4]). Linearising with a guess obtained by extrapolating

. . . Rigid Body in a Fluid . . .

13

through solutions from the previous two time steps leads to second order accuracy. This
is an improvement on the conventional method by an order of magnitude.

Theorem 1 The linearised terms, (2v |t −v |t−∆t) · ∇v |t+∆t and v |t+∆t
·∇(2v |t
−v |t−∆t), are second order accurate (have error O(∆t2)) approximations of the nonlinear
term (v · ∇v) |t+∆t.

Proof:

= [2v |t −v |t−∆t] · ∇v |t+∆t +O(∆t2)

The above linearisation schemes are an improvement on the conventional v |t ·∇v |t+∆t
or v |t+∆t ·∇v |t linearisation schemes by an order of magnitude.

†

Further reﬁnement of this second order accurate solution can usually be accomplished
by the process of Picard iteration, if necessary – providing the initial guess lies within a
radius of convergence. Picard iteration amounts to “linearising” the nonlinear term with
the solution obtained during the previous iterate.

6.3 Approximate Fluid Equation

An updated approach and the choice of a referential conﬁguration which coincides with
the spatial conﬁguration at the instant within each time step about which the equations
are to be evaluated, facilitates the elimination of the deformation gradient from the re-
sulting ﬂuid scheme completely (under such conditions the deformation gradient becomes
identity – see Childs [3]).

A backward diﬀerence is used to approximate the time derivative in accordance with the
ﬁndings of Childs [3]. The ﬁnite element method is used for the spatial (referential
“space” – the reference deforms) discretisation and a Q2–P1 element pair is the chosen
basis. A penalty method is used to eliminate pressure as a variable. The approximate

6.4 A Guideline for Artiﬁcial Reynolds Number Adjustment

A straight forward Picard iteration process (in which the convective term is linearised)
may not be suﬃcient at higher Reynolds numbers where the nonlinear term becomes

†The Q2–P1 element pair was shown to satisfy the L.B.B. condition in the context of rectangular
elements. It is important to note in this regard that a linear function mapped from the master element

more signiﬁcant and the radius of convergence is smaller. What one has to do under
such circumstances is implement a continuation technique. That is, lower the Reynolds
number to a level where convergence is attainable, then raise it incrementally, obtaining
progressively better solutions at each stage. Choosing these various artiﬁcial Reynolds
number levels can, however, turn out to be somewhat problematic. What follows was
devised as a guideline in making this choice. Suppose the nonlinear and linear parts
of the equations are expressed in terms of two matrices, A and B, respectively. The
equations to be solved are then

Ankjvkvj + Bnjvj + cn = 0.

Theorem 2 A suﬃcient condition for the iterative linearisation method to converge is

|| D ||p< 1

where

Djl = (Ankjvi−1

k − Bnj)−1Anlmvi−1
m ,

|| . ||p denotes the generalised p norm and the superscript i denotes the number of the
iteration from which a given solution was obtained (Childs and Reddy [4]).

Proof: Let ǫi−1 denote the diﬀerence between the solutions obtained from the ith and
(i − 1)th iterations. That is,

ǫi−1 = vi − vi−1

The system of equations solved at the (i − 1)th Picard iterate was accordingly

Remark: This guideline serves only to examine local convergence, and one still has to
hunt for a suitable Reynolds number by trial and error. It does, however, is provide an
exact quantitative measure of this local convergence and, depending on the solver used,
can improve eﬃciency.

7 A Predictor–Corrector or “Linearised” Approach

The combined free surface–ﬂuid–rigid body problem is highly nonlinear. An important
decision had to be taken on whether to solve the respective sub–problems simultaneously,
using a Newton–Raphson method, or separately using a predictor–corrector (iterative)
approach. The latter approach may be justiﬁed in terms of a Picard-type linearisation
process (similar to that discussed in Section 6.2 when dealing with the convective term).

The advantages of a predictor–corrector approach over solving simultaneously (the ap-
proach taken by many) are expected to be a larger radius of convergence and hence a
more robust scheme, substantially less code and easy, separate testing of sub–problems.

The disadvantages of a predictor–corrector approach over solving simultaneously are ex-
pected to be linear, as opposed to quadratic, rates of convergence. The expected slow
rate of convergence could possibly be overcome to a degree by taking good initial guesses
based on previous solutions, using linear extrapolation for example.

7.1 The Resulting Algorithm

Figure 3 outlines the algorithm which results from the use of such a linearised approach.
The solution values of the ﬂuid sub–problem are used in solving the free surface sub–
problem, working out the traction on the rigid body and consequently in solving the rigid
body sub–problem. The mesh is then adjusted accordingly and, if not the ﬁrst iteration,
If only the ﬁrst iteration, alternatively, if the degree of
the convergence is examined.
convergence is found to be unsatisfactory, the process is repeated. Once this iteration
process has converged, a new time step is commenced.

. . . Rigid Body in a Fluid . . .

17

The O(∆t4) Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg and Adams–Moulton approximations used in the
rigid body sub–problem are possibly excessive in comparison to the O(∆t) ﬁnite diﬀerence
schemes implemented in the ﬂuid and free surface problems.

8 Automatic Mesh Generation About Included Bod-

ies of Any Shape

The ﬁnite element mesh was automatically generated and adjusted about the included
rigid body in what is possibly a slightly novel fashion. A small region of mesh immediately
adjacent to the included rigid body was repeatedly remapped to cope with the changing
orientation, the remainder was squashed/stretched according to the translation.

Local Distortion About an Included Rigid Body

The local distortion about included rigid bodies is obtained by mapping four square
chunks of rectangular mesh to the four wedge–shaped domains depicted in Figure 4 using
ﬁnite element mappings. A square region of mesh centered on, and including the rigid
body, is ﬁrst removed. Each of the depicted wedge–shaped regions is then demarcated
by as many points as there are nodes in an element i.e. each wedge shaped–region is set
up as a massive element.

Demarcation: Demarcation is accomplished by ﬁrst locating the intersection of the lines
which bisect corners and edges of the square frame, with the surface of the rigid body
using Newton’s method. The remainder of this demarcation process needs no explanation.

S.J. Childs, B.D. Reddy

Mapping: Chunks of uniform mesh, which have identical extremities to those of the
master element, are then mapped into the newly–demarcated, wedge–shaped regions
using ﬁnite element mappings. The devised method maps chunks of uniform mesh into
wedge–shaped regions surrounding the included rigid body in exactly the same manner
as points in the master element domain are, in theory, mapped into individual mesh
elements. In the ﬁnite element mapping,

symbols which previously denoted the master element, the master element variables, the
corresponding position in the domain, the position of node i and element e now denote
the following: ˆΩ – the chunk of uniform mesh, ξ – the position of a constituent node in
the chunk, x – the corresponding position in the wedge, xi – the position of the ith point
demarcating the wedge and Ωe – the wedge.

Interface Adjustment: Further ﬁne adjustment of nodes intended to delineate the
surface of the rigid body is accomplished by moving them along a line between node
and centre, to the rigid body surface using Newton’s method, thereby accomodating
additional shape complexity.

Rotating and Translating.

The method described was found to be remarkably practical, simple and eﬀective with
maximum angles never exceeding π

4 radians at element vertices within the mesh.

Translational Mesh Deformation

The mesh outside the “box” (the box containing the 4 “wedges” enclosing the rigid
body) is squashed/stretched according to the requirements of the translation (the nodes
are translated in the same direction by a factor inversely proportional to their distance
from the box).

multaneously Rotating and Translating.

9 Some Test Examples

The ﬁnal model was tested in the context of a driven cavity ﬂow, a driven cavity ﬂow
with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem and a Stokes, second–order wave.
The idea was to use as simple as possible ﬂows at extremely low Reynolds numbers, so as
to generate the smoothest possible ﬂows in which any resulting rigid body motion could
be expected to be highly predictable, alternatively examples for which there exist well
established results.

9.1 Example 1: Driven Cavity Flow

A variety of bench-mark tests for viscous, incompressible ﬂows are cited in the literature.
The driven cavity ﬂows of Carey and Krishnan [2] and Simo and Armero [15] are two

22

S.J. Childs, B.D. Reddy

such examples. The so–called “leaky lid” driven cavity ﬂow of Simo et. al. was found to
be the more sensitive of the two when testing the performance of schemes approximating
tested the scheme for the
the Navier–Stokes equations.
Navier-Stokes equations rigorously using the leaky lid problem.

In addition, Simo et. al.

These results could be used as a comparison in testing the performance of the completely
general referential description derived in Childs [3] as well as to compare the perfor-
mance of the standard, penalty method (used here) with that of the iterative, augmented
Lagrangian approach (used by Simo et. al.). The main objective of these tests was
nonetheless to generate and study as smooth as possible a ﬂow into which a somewhat
inconsequential (ﬂow–wise inconsequential) rigid body could later be introduced (see the
forthcoming example).

Remark: Both the above mentioned ﬂows are steady in the context of the traditional
Eulerian description. They are, however, “unsteady” in the context of a deforming mesh,
a factor enhancing their potential as tests.

The problem is that of a square, two–dimensional “pot” whose lid is moved across the top
at a rate equal to its diameter for a Reynolds number of unity. The boundary conditions
are accordingly “no slip” on container walls and a horizontal ﬂow of unity across the top
(as depicted in Figure 7). The problem also bears a certain resemblance to an idealised
pothole in a river bed. A mesh consisting of one hundred and forty four elements was
deformed at diﬀering rates (also depicted in Figure 7).

Figure 7: The Problem, the Mesh and the Pressures Obtained Using the Conventional
Eulerian Equations.

Results

The results in Figures 8, 9 and 10 obtained while deforming the 144 element mesh de-
picted, are in agreement with those obtained using the analogous Navier–Stokes algorithm
on a ﬁxed uniform mesh (the control results in Figure 7 and the relevant velocity proﬁles

. . . Rigid Body in a Fluid . . .

23

in Figure 10 on page 24). They are also in agreement with the results of Simo and
Armero [15], obtained using the Navier–Stokes equations (the conventional Eulerian
description) on a ﬁxed, uniform mesh consisting of 3200 triangular elements.

Figure 8: Pressures Obtained Using the Completely General Referential Equation.

The ﬁxed, uniform mesh, with which the control results were obtained, consisted of 144
9–noded, quadrilateral elements. In the ﬁrst test all, but the 25 upper boundary nodes,
were compressed into the lower 95 % of the problem domain after which the mesh was
restored to a uniform state.

Figure 9: Pressures Obtained Using the Completely General Referential Equation.

The mesh was successively compressed and decompressed over two time steps, each of
length 0.05. Mesh velocities were therefore of the order of 10 times greater than the ﬂow
velocities being modelled.

In the second test (Figs. 11, 12 and 13) all but 25 boundary nodes were compressed into
the lower three quarters of the domain after which the mesh was restored to a uniform
state.

Figure 11: Pressures Obtained Using the Completely General Referential Equation.

In this example the mesh was successively compressed and decompressed by 25 % over
two time steps of length 0.05. Mesh velocities were therefore of the order of 50 times
greater than the ﬂow velocities being modelled.

Figure 12: Pressures Obtained Using the Completely General Referential Equation.

The error is attributed to a combination of a bad mesh (mostly) and relatively high
oﬀ–scale mesh velocities.
It should be remembered that a bad mesh is a bad mesh
nonetheless.

Remark: A further fact illustrated by the results of this test is that, of the pressure
and velocity solutions, the pressure solution is the more sensitive of the two. This is
to be expected since the pressure is recovered from what is fundamentally a diﬀerence
in something like the tenth decimal place of the velocity solution (see equation (5))
depending on the penalty parameter.

9.2 Example 2: “Pebble in a Pothole”

In this example rigid bodies of varying mass and moments of inertia were released from
rest in a ﬂow dictated by the same boundary conditions as the driven cavity ﬂow of
the previous example. One would expect a “die bead” (a small rigid body of neutral
bouyancy) to move in tandem with the ﬂuid soon after its release from rest. One might
also expect a clockwise spinning to be induced by concentrating the mass closer to the
centre i.e. lowering the moment of inertia.

Various rigid bodies were introduced to the cavity driven ﬂow problem described in
Subsection 9.1, in the absence of a body force. Although the algorithm allows for the
inclusion of a rigid body of any shape, one which could be expected to behave fairly
predictably was selected for the purposes of the test. The results presented shortly
involve the elliptical rod–shaped body

22 +

12 = 0.0252,

whose major axis is 0.1.

Results

The results which follow were in agreement with the notion that the die bead would move
in tandem with the ﬂuid soon after its release from rest. In the succesive trajectories in
Figure 14 the mass was successively concentrated closer to the centre (a lower moment
of inertia was used). A clockwise spin was then induced.

The last trajectory in Figure 14 was obtained using a Reynolds number of unity in order
to generate a smooth, predictable ﬂow as close as possible to the driven cavity ﬂow
of Subsection 14. Although the scaling is not immediately reminiscent of any real life
problem, the example serves to further verify the potential of the methods described
qualitatively.

The results for the included rigid body tests were extremely encouraging. This is es-
pecially so when it is considered that the Reynolds numbers implied by small, included
rigid bodies are low and the model being developed is eventually intended to elucidate
problems of a sedimentological nature.

9.3 Example 3: Die Swell Problems

The axis–symmetric die swell (or ﬂuid jet) problem is a free surface problem well doc-
umented in the literature. The exact details of the problem description always diﬀer to
varying degrees, however, the central theme basic to all involves the extrusion of a ﬂuid
with initial parabolic ﬂow proﬁle from the end of a short nozzle. The various boundaries
in terms of which this particular version is speciﬁed are depicted in Figure 15.

Results

Examples of die swell problems in which X = 1, Lo = 3.5 and L = 20 for various
kinematic viscosities and/or velocity scales were examined using a 150 (50 × 3) element
mesh. The predicted die swell ratios agree well with those obtained by other, more
speciﬁc methods.

Compare 1 the result of Omodei [14], Figure 5 (on page 87) with the corresponding
Re = 1 result depicted in Figure 16, for example. Good agreement is obtained between
Omodei’s Figure 7 (on page 88) result and the corresponding Re = 10 result depicted
in Figure 17, likewise between his Figure 8 (on page 89) result and the corresponding
Re = 18 result depicted in Figure 18. These results are further substantiated by those of
Kruyt, Cuvelier, Segal and Van Der Zanden [11], and those of Engelman and
Dupret quoted in Kruyt et al..

In this test the velocity proﬁle and surface elevation predicted by Stokes second order
wave theory were used as boundary conditions for ﬂow and free surface subproblems
respectively. The development of Stokes second order theory is the same as that of
Airy wave (Stokes ﬁrst order) theory, the exception being that terms as far as second
order (O
) in the power series expansion of the velocity potential are used. Wave
troughs are consequently ﬂatter and the crests are sharper than those predicted using
i
the corresponding ﬁrst order theory (see Koutitas [10] in this regard).

Results

The method converged rapidly to the Stokes second order surface (Figure 19 on page
33) in the initial stages, despite the use of some fairly preposterous free surface starting
guesses. This was found to be so for a range of wave lengths, amplitudes and domains
experimented with. The problem was, however, not attempted with the same serious-
ness as previous examples and the mesh was poor (there being only three elements in
the vertical extent of the mesh). Problems with wave propagation were consequently
experienced as time progressed.

10 Conclusions

The completely general referential description proposed in Childs [3] is variﬁed by the
numerical experiments of Section 9, as was the predictor–corrector approach proposed
in Section 7. Although the resources at the authors disposal limited the tests to two
dimensional problems, this is not expected to be of any consequence.

The linearised terms (2v |t −v |t−∆t) · ∇v |t+∆t and v |t+∆t ·∇(2v |t −v |t−∆t) are second
order accurate approximations of the convective term. The formula given in Theorem 2
provides an exact quantitative measure of local convergence for a given Reynolds number
when applying a continuation technique and, depending on the solver used, can improve
eﬃciency.

The more eﬃcient and more easily implemented penalty method was found to produce
comparable results to the iterative augmented Lagrangian approach (through which in-
compressibility can be exactly enforced) in the simple test examples performed. With
regard to the L.B.B. condition, it is important to note that a linear basis function mapped
from the master element using a Q2 mapping will no longer be P1 for non–rectangular el-
ements (the Q2–P1 element pair was shown to satisfy the L.B.B. condition in the context
of rectangular elements).

The holistic method to automatically generate meshes about rigid bodies included within
the ﬂuid, using ﬁnite element mappings, was found to be remarkably practical, simple
and eﬀective with maximum angles within the mesh never exceeding π
4 radians (outlined

34

in Section 8).

ABSTRACT

Autocatalytic reaction fronts between reacted and unreacted species may propagate as solitary

waves, namely at a constant front velocity and with a stationary concentration proﬁle, resulting

from a balance between molecular diﬀusion and chemical reaction. A velocity ﬁeld in the support-

ing medium may aﬀect the propagation of such fronts through diﬀerent phenomena: convection,

diﬀusion enhancement, front shape changes... We report here on an experimental study and lat-

tice BGK numerical simulations of the eﬀect of an oscillating ﬂow on the autocatalytic reaction

between iodate and arsenous acid in a Hele-Shaw cell. In the low frequency range covered by the

experiments, the front behavior is controlled by the ﬂow across the gap and can be reproduced

with 2D numerical simulations. An analytical solution is also derived under the condition of a

weak ﬂow velocity, and is found to be in reasonable agreement with our data.

Introduction

Interface motion and reaction front propagation occur in a number of diﬀerent areas [1], including

ﬂame propagation in combustion [2], population dynamics [3, 4] and atmospheric chemistry (ozone

hole). An autocatalytic reaction front between two reacting species propagates as a solitary wave,

that is, at a constant front velocity and with a stationary front proﬁle [5, 6]. These issues were

addressed earlier on, but only a few cases are understood, such as the pioneering works of Fisher

[3] and Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov [4] on a reaction-diﬀusion equation with a second-order

kinetics [1, 7, 8]. Although the eﬀect of an underlying ﬂow on a ﬂame propagation has been

extensively analyzed [2, 7], the advective eﬀect on the behavior of an autocatalytic front has been

addressed only recently [9, 10, 11, 12]. In this case, the evolution of the concentration of each

chemical species is given by the Advection-Diﬀusion-Reaction (ADR) equation:

reaction studied here, the kinetics is of the third order [1], f (C) = C2(1 − C), and the following

where z is the direction of the front propagation.

For a reaction propagating along the direction of a unidirectional stationary ﬂow,

regimes have been described, depending on the ratio η = b/2lχ, where b is the typical length scale

transversely to the ﬂow direction [14, 15, 16]. In the eikonal regime, η ≫ 1, the front propagates

as a planar wave, at a velocity given by the sum of Vχ and of the algebraic maximum of the
−→
Vχ), and takes the according stationary form. In

ﬂow velocity (projected onto the direction of

the mixing regime, η ≪ 1, the interplay between diﬀusion and advection enhances the mixing of

the chemical species and leads to an overall macroscopic diﬀusion known as Taylor hydrodynamic

dispersion [17]. As a result, the front moves faster. However, it is still described by equation (2),

in which the molecular diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dm has to be replaced by its eﬀective macroscopic

counterpart.

The main idea of the present paper is to address the eﬀect of an unsteady ﬂow on the front

propagation. We measure, experimentally and numerically, the velocity and width of a chemical

front submitted to a time periodic ﬂow, of period T = 1/f = 2π/ω. The question of the relevant

time scale, to which the time scale of the ﬂow, T , has to be compared, is discussed.

We extend the theoretical work by Nolen and Xin et al. [12], who derived the time-averaged

chemical front velocity in an oscillating ﬂow, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the front

velocity. We note that in the tracer case (without reaction), Chatwin [18] and Smith [19] showed,

using a Taylor-like approach [17], that a pulsating ﬂow results in an eﬀective time dependent dif-

fusion coeﬃcient, the time-average of which is larger than the molecular diﬀusion coeﬃcient [20].

In this paper, we study, experimentally and numerically, a third-order autocatalytic Iodate-

Arsenous Acid (IAA) reaction submitted to a pulsative ﬂow. In section 1, we present the experi-

mental set-up and the measurements obtained using a large set of frequencies and amplitudes of

oscillations. In section 2, we compare the experimental results with 2D numerical simulations and

we investigate a wider range of parameters with additional simulations. In the last section, we

extend the theoretical result by Nolen and Xin [12] to derive the temporal variations of the front

velocity.

Experimental set-up and data

We use the third-order autocatalytic Iodate-Arsenous Acid (IAA) reaction. The reaction front is

detected with starch, leading to a dark blue signature of the transient iodine as the reaction occurs

[1, 6, 13]. In the absence of ﬂow, a reaction front travels like a solitary wave, with a constant

velocity V exp

χ

(along x and y directions, respectively). The unidirectional (along z direction) oscillating ﬂow is

imposed at the bottom of a vertical HS cell, from a reservoir ﬁlled with unreacted species. This

revervoir is closed with a thin elastic membrane, pressed in its middle by a rigid rod ﬁxed at the

center of a loudspeaker. Consequently, a displacement of a given volume of liquid in the reservoir

induces a displacement of the same volume of liquid in the HS cell. The y − z plane of the HS

cell is enlightened from behind and recorded with a CCD camera. The amplitude A and the

pulsation ω = 2πf of the oscillating ﬂow are imposed by the controlled sine tension applied to

the loudspeaker, and measured in situ, from the recorded displacement of the air/liquid interface

at the top of the partially ﬁlled HS cell. This displacement follows the expected A sin (ωt) time

dependence. Due to the constraint of our device, the imposed amplitude and frequency of the

ﬂow displacement are in the ranges A ∈ [0.07 mm, 1.7 mm] and f ∈ [0.01 Hz, 0.2 Hz] and the

maximum velocity of the ﬂow in the cell is roughly UM = Aω. The oscillating ﬂow ﬁeld in the HS

cell is of the form (see Appendix for the full expression):

U (x, y, t) = UM ℜe[f (x, y)] sin (ωt)

(3)

The shape of the velocity proﬁle depends drastically on the viscous penetration length lν =

ν/ω

[21]. If lν is large compared to the cell thickness b (low frequency), the ﬂow variations are slow

p

enough for the steady state to be established. The resulting ”oscillating stationary” velocity proﬁle

is parabolic in the gap and ﬂat along the width h of the cell except in the vicinity of the side walls,

in a layer of thickness b [22]. Conversely, for lν << b (high frequency), the ﬂuid has not enough

time to feel the eﬀects of the solid boundaries and the velocity proﬁle is ﬂat over the whole cross-

section b × h, except in the vicinity of each wall, in a layer of thickness lν. Figure 1 is a sketch of
such an eﬀect. For our dilute aqueous solutions of viscosity ν ≈ 10−6 m2.s−1 and in our frequency

range, the penetration length lν, which ranges between 0.8 mm and 4 mm, is larger than the cell

thickness b = 0.4 mm.

Hence, in most of our experiments, the ”stationary velocity proﬁle” is instantaneously reached,

parabolic Poiseuille-like across the gap b, and almost invariant along the y direction (except in a

layer of thickness lν close to the boundaries).

Figure 2 displays snapshots of a typical experiment: We do observe a front slightly deformed,

product of the reaction to the fresh reactant.

¿From this movie, the front is tracked and its location is plotted as a function of time. The

so-obtained ﬁgure 3 clearly shows the oscillation of the front position at roughly the imposed

frequency and an overall drift of the front.

The measurement of this drift in time leads to the time-averaged front velocity hV exp

i with U is almost linear,

with a slope slightly larger than 0.1. This demonstrates that the propagation velocity of a reaction

front can be enhanced by a null in average, laminar ﬂow. Moreover, as the mean advection in

this time-periodic ﬂow is zero, this eﬀect comes clearly from some non-linear interplay. It could

be attributed to the enhancement of the mixing due to the presence of the ﬂow.
As mentioned above, it is seen from the instantaneous velocity curve (V exp

(t), ﬁgure 3), that

f

the front velocity oscillates at the frequency of the ﬂow. However, due to the experimental noise,

it is diﬃcult to obtain further information from this curve.

We also noticed from our observation of the experimental movies that the width of the colored

front, L(t), was likely to oscillate at a frequency twice that of the excitation, which, unfortunately,

is not obvious on the static pictures (ﬁgure 2). We note that this feature could support the

description of the front thickness in the framework of an eﬀective diﬀusion of coeﬃcient D, as the

latter is expected to be insensitive to the ﬂow direction and to depend only on the ﬂow intensity

To test this empirical observation, we measured the width L(t) of the dark blue ribbon. As

this ribbon corresponds to the presence of the transient iodine, L(t) is a qualitative measure of

the chemical front width, but gives however the right time behavior. A classical Fourier analysis

of L(t) was tried, but, due to the large amount of noise, it did not provide any reliable frequency

dependence. Therefore, we used the more sensitive micro-Doppler method (see [23, 24] and the

references therein) which analyzes an instantaneous signal frequency. The so-obtained oscillation
frequencies f ′ of the width L(t) versus the imposed ones f , are displayed in ﬁgure 5: They collapse
onto the straight line f ′ = 2f , which supports the contention that the front width oscillates at

twice the frequency of the ﬂow.

In order to have further insight into the instantaneous features of the propagating front, we

used numerical simulations, which are less noisy and give access to the behavior in the gap of the

cell.

2-D Numerical simulations

Assuming a third-order autocatalytic reaction kinetics for the IAA reaction [1, 6, 13] and a unidi-

where C is the concentration of the (autocatalytic) reactant iodide, normalized by the initial con-

(BGK) method, shown to be eﬃcient in similar contexts [15, 25, 26, 22]. The full 3D periodic

velocity ﬁeld U (x, y, t), in a Hele-Shaw cell, has been derived analytically in the Appendix (equa-

tion (26)). As mentioned above, the oscillating ﬂow ﬁeld does not vary much along the y direction

(except in a boundary layer of the order of the gap thickness b), and the velocity ﬁeld, away from

the side walls, is basically a 2D ﬂow ﬁeld, U (x, t), given by:

It is seen from these movies that the front oscillates and travels from the burnt product to

the fresh reactant. The mean concentration proﬁles are obtained by averaging along the lattice

width, and analyzed along the same line as in the experiments. Figure 7 shows the time evolution

of the displacement of the iso-concentration C = 0.5, obtained in the 2D simulations and in

the experiments: The agreement between the two supports the contention that in our frequency

range, the dynamics of the front is governed only by the variations of the velocity ﬁeld in the

gap (b = 0.4 mm), and that the (large) transverse extent of the plane of the experimental cells

(h = 8 mm) plays no role.

The use of the discrete version of (6) allows us to estimate the front width lf . Figure 9 displays

the time evolution of lf . After a transient time of the order of one ﬂow period, the front width

lf (t) becomes periodic and oscillates with a frequency twice that of the imposed ﬂow, in agreement

with the experimental result given in ﬁgure 5.

For a stationary laminar ﬂow, we showed in [16] that, under mixing regime conditions, the

velocity and width of the reaction front result from a Taylor-like diﬀusion process, with an eﬀective

diﬀusion coeﬃcient Def f such that Vf =

αDef f /2 and lf =

2Def f /α, leading to Vf /lf = α/2.

An easy way to test the relevance of this eﬀective diﬀusion description to the present case is to

measure the ratio of the time-averaged values hVf i/hlf i. Figure 10 clearly shows that the relation

between hVf i and hlf i is not linear. This allows us to discard the above description.

The information given by both the experiments and the numerical simulations may be sum-

marized as follows: In the presence of a periodic ﬂow, the propagation of a chemical front in a

Hele-Shaw cell is governed by the velocity proﬁle in the gap. The front position drifts in the natu-

ral direction of the chemical wave and undergoes oscillations at the frequency of the ﬂow whereas

the front width oscillates at twice this frequency. Finally, the front behavior cannot be described

in terms of a Taylor-like eﬀective diﬀusion.

In the next section, we derive a model, under the assumption of weak ﬂow velocity, and discuss

Theoretical determination of the front velocity

We have derived in a previous work [16], the velocity of a stationary reaction front, using a

small parameter expansion method. The two parameters were the reduced gap thickness b/lχ (or

η = b/2lχ) and the normalized ﬂow velocity ε = U /Vχ, with U = 2UM /3 in 2D. We shall use

diﬀusion regime). In the presence of a reaction, this condition becomes εη2 ≪ 1 [16]. We recall

constant ﬂows in the mixing regime [14, 16]. The leading order pulsative ﬂow contribution causes

the front to oscillate with the ﬂow frequency. At second order in ε, the contributions to the front

velocity are a constant one and one at twice the frequency of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Note that for ω = 0,

Conclusion

In this paper, we have analyzed the inﬂuence of a time-periodic ﬂow on the behavior of an autocat-

alytic reaction front. The numerical simulations are in reasonable agreement with the experiments

and show that the front dynamics is controlled by the ﬂow velocity in the gap of a Hele-Shaw cell

in the range of the parameters explored. We have shown that, contrary to the case of a stationary

laminar ﬂow, a Taylor-like approach cannot account for the (time-averaged) width and velocity

of the front. The instantaneous front velocity has been derived theoretically, in the weak ﬂow

velocity regime. It is found to be in reasonable agreement with the numerical simulation results

for |UM |/Vχ < 1.

in a Hele-Shaw cell

We consider a laminar ﬂow, unidirectional along the z direction, in a Hele-Shaw cell of cross-

section b × h (b ≪ h) in the x and y directions, respectively. The Navier-Stokes equation in the z

direction writes:

where a harmonic pressure gradient oscillating at frequency f = ω/2π is imposed, and the ﬂow

velocity U (x, y, t) satisﬁes the boundary conditions:

phase shift and a modulus which depend on space. We note that the maximum modulus UM occurs

in the middle of the cell (x = y = 0). In Expression (26), the ﬁrst two terms correspond to a 2D
oscillating ﬂow between two parallel boundaries at distance b (U ∗) [21], and the third one accounts
for the ﬁnite size of the cell in the larger direction h (U ∗∗). We note that at high frequency, a

plug ﬂow takes place in the section of the cell, except in a thin viscous layer lν =

ν/ω close to

the boundaries (y = ±h/2 and x = ±b/2). On the opposite, in the low frequency regime (lν ≫ b),

p

the oscillating ﬂow has the same shape as a static one given in [22]. Hence, except in a thin layer

(of thickness ∼ b ≪ h) close to the side boundaries (y = ±h/2), the ﬂow is a parabolic Poiseuille

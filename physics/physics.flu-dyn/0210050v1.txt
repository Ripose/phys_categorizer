Autocatalytic reaction between reacted and unreacted species may propagate as solitary waves,
namely at a constant front velocity and with a stationary concentration proﬁle, resulting from a
balance between molecular diﬀusion and chemical reaction. The eﬀect of advective ﬂow on the
autocatalytic reaction between iodate and arsenous acid in cylindrical tubes and Hele-Shaw cells
is analyzed experimentally and numerically using lattice BGK simulations. We do observe the
existence of solitary waves with concentration proﬁles exhibiting a cusp and we delineate the eikonal
and mixing regimes recently predicted.

The motion of interfaces and the propagation of fronts
resulting from chemical reactions occur in a number of
diﬀerent areas [1], including population dynamics [2, 3]
and ﬂame propagation [4].
It is known that autocat-
alytic reaction fronts between two reacting species prop-
agate as solitary waves, namely at a constant front ve-
locity and with a stationary concentration proﬁle [5, 6].
The important issue of the selection of the front velocity
was addressed earlier on, but only a few cases are well
understood, such as the pioneering works of Fisher [2]
and Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov [3] on a reaction-
diﬀusion equation with second-order kinetics [1, 4, 7].
The eﬀect of advective ﬂow (inviscid and/or turbulent)
in reacting systems was analyzed extensively in the prop-
agation of ﬂames in the context of combustion [4, 8].
On the other hand, advective eﬀects on the behavior
of autocatalytic fronts has been only recently addressed
[9, 10, 11].

B. F. Edwards [11] studied theoretically the eﬀect of
a 2D laminar ﬂow on an autocatalytic reaction front
between two inﬁnite planes separated by a gap b.
In
such geometries, the velocity proﬁle is unidirectional
in the direction z and given by Poiseuille’s equation,
−→
−→
U = UM (1 − ζ2)
z where UM = 1.5 U is the maxi-
mum velocity, U is the mean velocity, ζ = 2x/b is the
−→
transverse normalized coordinate.
z is the unit vector
parallel to the ﬂow, the latter is chosen to have the direc-
tion of the front propagation in the absence of ﬂow (see
below). This conﬁguration describes quantitatively the
experimental case of a Hele-Shaw cell, which consists of
two parallel plates separated by a gap b small compared
to the other dimensions, and qualitatively the case of a
cylindrical tube of inner radius a. The latter represents
a 2D axisymmetric situation for which the ﬂow ﬁeld is
also described by the above equation with ζ = r/a and
UM = 2U. Consider the iodate-arsenous acid reaction in
such geometries. Using a third-order autocatalytic reac-
tion kinetics, we have:

where C is the concentration of the (autocatalytic) re-
actant iodide, normalized by the initial concentration of

iodate, Dm is the molecular diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and α
is the reaction rate kinetic coeﬃcient.
In the absence

of hydrodynamics (
0 ), Eq.1 admits a well-known
U =
solitary wave with front velocity V0 = pαDm/2 and
front width L0 = Dm/V0 [5, 6]. The use of these two
quantities to normalize velocities and lengths in Eq.1,
leads to two independent parameters η = b/2L0 and
ε = U /V0. Reference [11] investigated numerically the
solitary wave solution of Eq.1, and particularly its front
velocity, v = VF /V0, as a function of ε, for diﬀerent values
of η. Of interest are the following asymptotic predictions:
In the narrow-gap regime (η → 0 or ε → 0), it was
found that v = 1 + ε. Namely, when L0 >> b, mixing
across the gap is signiﬁcant, concentration proﬁles are ﬂat
and the front is advected by the mean ﬂow: VF = V0 +U .
On the other hand, in the wide-gap regime (η ≫ 1),
fronts are thin, concentration proﬁles are curved across
the gap, and Eq.1 can be replaced by the eikonal equa-
tion:

(oriented from reacted to unreacted species),

to leading order and neglecting the local front curvature,
the front velocity is given by the simpliﬁed 1D eikonal
equation:

VF = V0/cosθ + U (ζ)

n and the ﬂow direction
where θ is the angle between
and U (ζ) is the advection velocity. Under these con-
ditions, reference [11] predicted two diﬀerent behaviors
depending on the ﬂow direction:

For a supporting ﬂow (ε > 0), then VF = V0 + UM ,
which means that the front is advected at the largest
possible velocity. The front shape across the gap is then
given by the solution of Eq.3.

For an adverse ﬂow (ε < 0), VF = V0, which also
represents the maximum algebraic velocity one could
have expected physically. The front shape is ﬂat (θ = 0)
at the walls ζ = ±1, and presents a cusp in the middle
of the gap (discontinuity of V0/cosθ at ζ = 0). Here,

the adverse ﬂow elongates the front but does not slow it
down. Note that curvature eﬀects (Dmκ in Eq.2) smooth
the cusp, but do not otherwise alter these predictions.

The objective of the present letter is to experimentally
test these 2D predictions, by conducting experiments
In addition,
in Hele-Shaw cells and cylindrical tubes.
we analyze the experiments by conducting lattice BGK
simulations [12] of the full Eq.1 in the 3D ﬂow of the
Hele-Shaw cell and in the 2D ﬂow resulting from the
averaging of the ﬂow velocity across the gap of the cell.

In the experiment, the front is detected by using
starch, at small concentrations, which reacts in the
presence of iodine leading to a dark blue signature of the
front passage [6, 12]. First, we consider the reaction in
−→
the absence of advection by the ﬂow (
0 ). As ex-
pected, we observe solitary fronts propagating with ﬂat
proﬁles across the gap. In accordance with [5, 6], their
velocity is V0 ∼ 0.02 mm/s, and their front thickness
L0 = Dm/V0 ∼ 0.1 mm (Dm ∼ 2.10−9 m2/s). Because
the reaction products have a lower density than the
unreacted species, the hydrodynamically stable situation
corresponds to descending fronts in vertical tubes. In the
following, we focus on the interplay between advection
and propagating fronts. To minimize the eﬀect of density
contrast, we studied the propagation of buoyantly stable
fronts in small cells. We used vertical Hele-Shaw cells
of size b × W = 0.1 × 1, 0.2 × 4, 0.4 × 8, 1 × 15 mm2
and circular capillary tubes of radius a = 0.3, 0.58, 0.88
and 1.9 mm. A constant advecting ﬂow, upwards or
downwards, was ﬁxed by a syringe. Note that these
cells are small enough to prevent ﬂattening of the front
due to buoyancy, but large enough to enable a constant
ﬂow rate injection with our injection device. The aver-
age velocity of the imposed ﬂow ranged from 0 to ∼ 40V0.

For ﬂow in a 3D Hele-Shaw cell, the velocity proﬁle
is unidirectional and depends on the two transverse
coordinates, x and y [14]. The proﬁle across the gap is
almost parabolic with a gap average value uniform over
the width W , except in a boundary layer of order b,
within which the velocity vanishes (see the gap average
proﬁle on the right of Fig.3). For the three aspect ratios
studied (W/b = 10, 15, 20), we found UM /U = 1.60, 1.57
and 1.55 respectively.

For all ﬂow rates investigated, we observed solitary
waves. Typical proﬁles are shown in Fig.1 in the plane
of Hele-Shaw cells (top diagram) and in tubes (bottom
diagram). Two adverse ﬂows (on the left) and two
supportive ﬂows (on the right) are given for each geom-
etry. The front bends in the direction expected from
the underlying ﬂow ﬁeld, while its distortion increases
with ﬂow intensity (recall that the fronts are ﬂat in the
absence of ﬂow, U = 0). Surprisingly, this phenomenon
is more pronounced in the case of adverse ﬂows (ε < 0),
with cusp-like fronts observed both in the plane of
Hele-Shaw cells and in tubes. The triangular shapes

premixed ﬂames [15].

The two graphs in Fig.1 show the normalized front
velocities v = VF /V0 versus ε = U /V0, measured for
diﬀerent sizes of the Hele-Shaw cells and tubes. For
each data set (given η), the front velocity increases
linearly with the ﬂow rate, but with a diﬀerent slope
for the two cases of supportive and adverse ﬂow. This
change of slope is in accordance with [11] as well as the

most of the data fall in the domain delimited by the
asymptotic regimes described above. The exceptions
correspond to supportive ﬂows in the smaller tubes
(1 < η < 10), which, unlike Edward’s 2D numerical
data, fall below the mixing regime (predicted for η ≪ 1).
This diﬀerence needs to be further analyzed, given
that it is diﬃcult to achieve experimentally a very low
constant ﬂow rate injection in the small tubes. At

2D gap analysis gives correct front velocity predictions,
shapes in the plane of the Hele-Shaw cell other than a
ﬂat one are not supposed to be handled by this 2D anal-
ysis. In fact, it is highly surprising that the actual shape
observed in the plane of the cell hardly modiﬁes the front
velocity.

locity ε for the smallest Hele-Shaw cell of size 1 × 0.1 mm2
(η = 0.5, W = 10). The full line corresponds to the mixing
regime (η → 0) while the dashed lines correspond to the eikonal
regime (η → ∞).

the same time, some authors [10] have suggested that
the mixing straight line should be higher. Using the
Peclet number (P e = U a/Dm = εη), which compares
the relative importance of advection over diﬀusion, and
the Damk¨ohler number (Da = αa/U = 2η/ε), which
compares the ratio of advective to reactive time-scales,
they predicted [10] that for Da ≪ 1 (which is not
attainable in our experiments), the front velocity should
be the product of V0 by the Taylor dispersion factor
[16], which accounts for the coupling between advection
and transverse diﬀusive mixing. This factor would then
enhance the front velocities.

The measured data are very close to the mixing regime
in the case of the Hele-Shaw cells and ε > 0. In partic-
ular, the measured front velocities for large supportive
ﬂows in the thinner cell (displayed in Fig.2) fall on the
asymptotic mixing regime predicted by the strictly 2D
analysis [11] (Vf = V0 + ¯U for η → 0). As the normal-
ized gap b/2L0 is small (0.5, 1, 2, 5), whereas the normal-
ized width W/2L0 is large (5, 20, 40, 75), one infers that
η = b/2L0, introduced in the 2D gap analysis [11], is still
the governing parameter in the case of our 3D Hele-Shaw
cells. It follows that the front velocity is controlled by the
physics occurring in the gap of the cell (namely the mix-
ing), in accordance with the 2D gap analysis predictions.
This is also true for the Hele-Shaw cell front velocities
measured in the case of adverse ﬂows. In this case, the
measured velocities are close to the mixing asymptotic
regime for small ﬂow rates, and exhibit some departure
toward the eikonal regime (Vf = V0) when either η or
the ﬂow rate is increased. This trend is even more pro-
nounced for the tubes, which present larger η values than
the Hele-Shaw cells. It should be noted that although the

lattice BGK simulations. Crosses: 2D simulations using the gap
averaged ﬂow ﬁeld (sketched on the right). On the left: picture
of the experimental stationary front with the same η = 1 and
ε = −4.8 as in the simulations.

To obtain some insight into the interplay between the
shape of the front and its velocity, we performed 3D and
2D lattice BGK simulations under the same conditions as
in one of the experiments using the same ε, η, and W/L0.
The 3D ﬂow ﬁeld was computed from [14], from which
the 2D was obtained from a gap average. As pointed out
previously, this 2D velocity ﬁeld (sketched on the right of
Fig.3), U (y) ≃ (UM /1.5) × (1 − cosh[πy/b]/ cosh[πW/2b],
is almost constant over the width W of the cell, ex-
cept for a small boundary layer of extension b. Fig.3
also shows the time development of the iso-concentration
C = 0.5, initially ﬂat, towards the stationary triangu-
lar shape. The proﬁles given by the 3D simulation at
later stages compare very well with the stationary ex-
perimental one (displayed on the far left of the ﬁgure).
The dynamics of the triangular shape formation shows
that the growth starts from the boundary, where occurs
an early determination of both the ﬁnal front velocity
and the ﬁnal angle θ: this is achieved when the proﬁle
is altered over a typical distance b from the walls. This
supports the contention that the dynamics does not de-
pend on W and that η = b/2L0 is the relevant parameter.
More surprisingly, the 3D simulation results fall on top
of the 2D simulations. This ﬁnding suggests that the in-
gredients of both the shape and the velocity of the front
are well captured by these 2D simulations in this regime.
The fact that both the 2D gap and the Hele-Shaw plane
description provide almost the same front velocity might
be due to the similarity between the velocity proﬁles in
the gap and in the boundary layer in the plane, namely
due to comparable velocity variations over comparable
extension (b).

In conclusion, we have performed experiments and
lattice BGK simulations of autocatalytic reaction fronts
in laminar advective ﬂow ﬁelds in Hele-Shaw cells and
circular tubes. Solitary waves were observed over the
entire range of ﬂow rates. For ﬂows adverse to the
chemical front propagation, we observe cusp-like fronts

in tubes and triangular fronts in the plane of Hele-Shaw
cells. Our front velocity measurements agree with the
in the limiting cases
2D asymptotic predictions [11],
where either diﬀusion overcomes reaction (η ≪ 1) or it
is negligible (η ≫ 1). It would be interesting to extend
the size range of the cells. We could use larger cells to
study the buoyancy stabilizing eﬀect and smaller cells

within the scope of microﬂuidics.

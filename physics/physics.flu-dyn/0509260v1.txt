Abstract

An asymptotic theory is developed for a moving drop driven by a wettability gradient. We distinguish the

mesoscale where an exact solution is known for the properly simpliﬁed problem. This solution is matched

at both – the advancing and the receding side – to respective solutions of the problem on the microscale.

On the microscale the velocity of movement is used as the small parameter of an asymptotic expansion.

Matching gives the droplet shape, velocity of movement as a function of the imposed wettability gradient

and droplet volume.

INTRODUCTION

The description of the movement of a three-phase contact line is an essentially unsolved hydro-

dynamical problem that continues to attract much interest, for instance, when studying spreading

drops, and liquid sheets or ridges moving down an inclined plate. The understanding of ’simple’

contact line movement is also paramount for a deeper insight in related problems as the dynamical

wetting transition and transversal instabilities of moving contact lines.

It is well known that the divergent shear stress at the contact line forbids a solution in the

framework of purely classical hydrodynamics, i.e. assuming a no-slip boundary condition at the

solid-liquid interface. Although this was ﬁrst pointed out by Huh and Scriven1 based on Moffatt’s2

solution for ﬂow in the edge which does not satisfy the normal stress boundary condition on a free

interface, and was never proven rigorously, the divergence can be understood as a consequence

of incompatibility of multivaluedness of the velocity at the contact point in the classical hydrody-

namic formulation.

The boundary condition has to be relaxed to permit movement of the contact line. This can be

done by introducing a very thin precursor ﬁlm on the ’dry’ substrate3, or by allowing for slip at

the solid-liquid interface everywhere1 or only near the contact line4,5, or introducing an effective

molecular interaction between the substrate and liquid into the hydrodynamic model6,7. For a

discussion of the slip condition see also the review by Dussan8. Other approaches include phase

changes at the contact line9 or introduce the vapour-liquid or ﬂuid-solid interface, or both, as

separate phases with properties that differ from the bulk ﬂuid10.

Most of the work on moving liquid sheets and ridges prescribes a precursor ﬁlm or slip at the

substrate. Divergence problems at the contact line are avoided, but at the expense of introducing

ad hoc parameters into the theory. These, namely the slip length or the precursor ﬁlm thick-

ness, inﬂuence the proﬁle of ridges and fronts and hence also the characteristics of the transverse

instability3,11,12,13.

The most realistic option is the explicit introduction of molecular interactions into the hydro-

dynamic formalism. This is accomplished by means of an additional pressure term, the disjoining

pressure14. Depending on the particular problem treated, this disjoining pressure may incorpo-

rate long-range van der Waals and/or various types of short-range interaction terms6,7,15. Recently

Pismen16 derived a ﬁlm thickness equation with a disjoining pressure term by combining the long

wave approximation for thin ﬁlms17 with a nonlocal diffuse interface description for the liquid-gas

2

interface that incorporates van der Waals interactions.

These interactions are essential for the process of dewetting, and studies of dewetting

of a thin liquid ﬁlm on a substrate are generally based on models involving a disjoining

pressure18,19,20,21,22,23. Only a few studies of instabilities of liquid fronts have adopted a similar

approach24,25,26, despite the fact that such an approach predicts all the ad hoc parameters of the

slip or precursor models (i.e., the static and dynamic contact angle, drop velocity, and the drop

and precursor ﬁlm thickness) connected with the wetting properties of the liquid in terms of the

parameters characterizing the disjoining pressure.

Recently, Eggers presented asymptotic solutions for the proﬁle of advancing27 and receding28

driven contact lines (see also Ref. 29). The respective solutions match inner solutions near the

contact line where a slip model is used and outer solutions based on an analytic solution in terms

of Airy functions discussed in Refs. 30,31,32,33. However, the advancing and receding case are

studied for a plate pushed into and pulled out of a liquid bath, respectively. It is not possible to

directly couple the two asymptotic solutions to describe the motion of a driven moving droplet or

ridge.

In the present work we tackle the problem of an asymptotic description of a gradient-driven

moving droplet that encompasses both an advancing and a receding contact line. This implies

that the description of the two contact lines and the respective matching procedures depend on

each other. Thereby we explicitly introduce the molecular interactions into the hydrodynamic

formalism by using a chemical potential or disjoining pressure describing a situation of partial

wetting. This corresponds to a precursor ﬁlm model where the precursor ﬁlm thickness is deter-

mined through the disjoining pressure.

We distinguish among three regions:

Microscopic (molecular scale) region: the dominant balance is between disjoining potential

and surface tension.

•

•

sion.

Mesoscopic region: the dominant balance is between viscous dissipation and surface ten-

Macroscopic region: the dominant balance is between surface tension and external forces

Examples for driving forces are gravity for droplets or fronts on inclined plates, Marangoni forces

occurring if temperature gradients along the substrate exist or wettability gradients along the sub-

strate. Both, gravity and Marangoni forces act in the lubrication limit as bulk forces, i.e. the force

3

is fed into the system in a top-down manner. This implies that the macroscopic region has to be

included in the description. However, the third mentioned way to drive the system is based on

a force resulting from a wettability gradient that is fed into the system in a bottom-up manner,

i.e. on the microscale. The simplest description of such a system is undertaken here by matching

solutions obtained in the mesoscopic and microscopic region. If the droplets are small enough

(smaller than the capillary length) the macroscopic scale can be ignored.

There are different physical situations where a gradient in wettability occurs that can be mapped

onto the presently studied model. (i) A droplet can ’sit’ on a step in wettability34 allowing for

an intermittent range of stationary movement until the complete drop sits on the more wettable

substrate. (ii) A droplet can move along a smooth wettability gradient35,36,37,38. (iii) In a situation

involving an adsorption reaction at the substrate underneath the droplet a droplet can produce the

wettability gradient that drives its movement39,40,41,42. In this way it carries the gradient along

with its movement. The latter case is also related to droplet motion caused by a surface phase

transitions43.

In the following we study all these situations in a model that uses a chemical potential with

different constants at the advancing and the receding contact line, respectively. For situations (ii)

and (iii) this corresponds to the assumption that the wettability gradient is small as compared to

the size of the contact zone but sizable as compared to the overall droplet size.

In the next section the basic equations for the lubrication description of moving droplets are

introduced. The exact solution in the mesoscopic region and its asymptotics are described in

Section III. The microscopic solution and its asymptotic matching are discussed in Section IV.

Finally, a comparison of asymptotic and numerical results is given together with our conclusions

in section V.

shall use the simplest mobility function k(h) = η−

properties. Note, that it corresponds to the negative of a disjoining pressure Π as used, for instance,

where Qs is a characteristic excess ﬂuid–substrate interaction energy, which is proportional to
the Hamaker constant15. If Qs > 0, this form corresponds to a negative long-range and positive

short-range part of the spreading coefﬁcient, thereby combining a destabilizing long-range and

a stabilizing short-range van der Waals interaction. The contact angle is ﬁnite, and bulk ﬂuid

coexists at Π = 0, i.e. in a ﬂat layer of macroscopic thickness in the absence of external forces,

with an ultrathin precursor of thickness hm.

The variables in Eq. (1) are still dimensional but scaled to conform with the lubrication approx-

imation. They are related to the physical variables (marked by a hat) as follows:

h = h,

x = x/ǫ,

t = t/ǫ2.

However, here we are interested in moving droplets driven by wettability gradients along the

substrate. In the chemical potential chosen here [Eq. (2)] a wettability increase can be modelled by

a decrease of Qs or by an increase of hm. We chose here the former possibility. Note, however, that

in a real physical system both parameters are affected. The analysis then involves more algebra

but is also straightforward.

We shall consider stationary motion of a 2D droplet with the velocity U. Replacing in Eq. (1)

For s† < s0 < 0 the height ζ increases monotonically with x. These solutions are used as a

model for a receding contact line in Ref. 28. If, however, s0 > 0, the proﬁle ζ(x) has a maximum

at s = s0 corresponding to x = 0; the solutions ζ(x) pass through a minimum at smin < s0, i.e.

B. Physically relevant interval

We focus here on the case of moderately large s0 taking the proﬁle between ζ = 0 for x = x⋆

and the minimum of ζ(x) at x = xmin as the outer solution for a moving droplet driven by a force

fed in on the microscale. The two parameters s0 and K, as well as the droplet velocity that is

absorbed into the scaling, should be obtained by matching the two inner (microscopic) solutions

at advancing and receding sides, as well as ﬁxing the droplet volume.

C. Limit of weak driving

Although Eq. (7) does not contain the rescaled capillary number δ, we expect the applicable

outer solution to become symmetric, approaching a parabolic proﬁle, in the limit δ

0, which

→

corresponds to a vanishing wettability gradient. As illustrated in Fig. 1 and conﬁrmed by the

following asymptotic analysis, the outer solution becomes almost symmetric at large values of s0,

which, as we shall further see, correspond to small values of δ.

The limit s0 → ∞

can be obtained with the help of the asymptotics (10) of Airy functions,

which is practically applicable already at moderately large values s0 > 2. The resulting asymptotic

IV. MICROSCOPIC SOLUTION AND MATCHING

A. Expansion in δ

In the microscopic region, the thickness changes from h = hm to a “mesoscopic” value far

exceeding hm but small compared to the drop size and capillary length (that is here inﬁnite).

Solving Eq. (4) with δ = 0 deﬁnes the static contact angle in the limit h

, while for δ

= 0

an apparent dynamic contact angle is obtained in this limit. The appropriate length scale in this

region is hm; the respective dimensionless form of Eqs. (4) and (5) is

expect corrections due to the disjoining potential to become signiﬁcant only well below this value.

However, as we will illustrate in the Conclusion, the ﬁrst order matching is already sufﬁcient to

V. CONCLUSION

We have developed an asymptotic theory for a moving drop driven by a wettability gradient.

Wide separation between the meso- and microscale allows us to use respective analytical and

expanded solutions on the different scales.

Matching of the mesoscale and microscale solutions at the advancing and the receding contact

region allows to obtain the droplet shape and the velocity of movement as functions of the imposed

wettability gradient and droplet volume. In this way, the two matching procedures together with

a translation between the different scalings gives a complete characterization of the droplet mo-

tion for a given physical volume V /θ0 and the wettability gradient characterized by the physical
receding ˆθrec

0 = θ0 and advancing ˆθadv

0 < θ0 equilibrium angle.

0 = θ0θadv

0 = θ0θrec

Fixing the overall long-wave scaling by ﬁxing θ0, the three relations between θadv

, V , δ, K

0

and s0 obtained in the course of the present work [Eqs. (33), (34) and (36) illustrated in Figs. 3,
4 and 5, respectively] allow us to determine the unknown δ, K and s0 for each given pair of θadv

0

and V . In Fig. 6 results of the asymptotic matching are given for the velocity δ, and the “shape

parameter” s0 in dependence of the advancing equilibrium contact angle θadv

volumes V . As expected, the velocity goes towards zero as the driving wettability difference

small numbers of the order of e−

however, remains almost static, and the integral relations of Ref. 48 can be used. The relations

The presented asymptotic theory is based on (i) a separation into micro- and mesoscale, i.e. it

is not valid for V too small (s0 becomes too small) and (ii) an expansion in δ, i.e. it is not valid for

δ too large. Assuming a precursor ﬁlm of 1 nm, V = 106 corresponds roughly to droplets of 1 µm

height, implying that the asymptotics is valid in the realm of microﬂuidics, but less so for nanoﬂu-

idics. However, because for nanodroplets the micro- and mesoscale are not well separated they

can be treated with numerical methods. It is convenient to calculate stationary moving droplets

using continuation techniques45,46 as shown, for instance, for nanodroplets moving under the inﬂu-

ence of a body force49,50 and chemically driven droplets41,42. However, the numerical calculation

becomes very tedious for larger drops because of the separation of scales.

In Fig. 7 we present a comparison of asymptotic results (stretched down to V = 106) obtained

from Eqs. (33), (34) and (36), small-δ results given by Eq. (40), and numerical continuation results

(stretched up to V = 108) for Eq. (21). For small driving θ0

three methods is reasonably good. For V = 106 the maximal deviation is below 15%, and for

V = 108 it is about 5%. As expected, for larger driving θ0

adv < 0.8 the results start to deviate,
the numerical solutions of the full Eq. (21) give a lower velocity than the asymptotics, and more

so for smaller θ0

adv (smaller driving). There
are various small factors that may contribute to the deviations at small driving: (i) for V = 108

adv. For larger droplets this deviation starts at larger θ0

the equilibrium contact angle still differs from the asymptotic value of one by about 0.3%; (ii)

for moving droplets the precursor ﬁlm thickness depends weakly on the dynamics49,51 implying a

droplet volume that is not exactly constant with changing velocity. For V = 108 and θ0

adv = 0.5
the precursor ﬁlm thickness is about 1.0025, i.e. for the used domain size of 106 the relative change

in droplet volume is negligible (∆V /V

10−

5).

≈

Surprisingly, the simple results obtained for small δ in Ref. 48 as the ratio of the driving force

and the dissipative integral [our Eq. (40)] seem to ﬁt the numerical data better than the asymptotic

theory. This results, apparently, from the cancelation of different approximations. The assumed

velocity-independent parabolic droplet shape underestimates, for instance, the dissipation at the

18

receding contact line and in the bulk, but overestimates the dissipation at the advancing contact

line. The advantage of the asymptotic theory can be better appreciated comparing the proﬁles of

the moving droplets (Fig.8).

The numerical results obtained by continuation (solid lines) strongly differ from the static

droplet shapes (dotted lines) that are the basis for the small-δ approximation Eq. (40). The asymp-

totic mesoscopic proﬁles [Eqs (11) and (12) with the parameters obtained from Eqs. (33), (34) and

(36)] approach the numerical results reasonably good for weak driving θ0

adv = 0.8, independently
of whether one compares proﬁles for identical velocity or driving (Fig.8 (a)). For larger driving,

the comparison of proﬁles for identical velocities gives better results. In general, the receding

part is described quite perfectly. The advancing part differs because the matching is based on the

advancing equilibrium contact angle that is smaller than the dynamical one.

Our treatment has made it clear that the characteristics of the moving droplets depend in a

crucial way on the kind of driving used. The droplet may be driven by body forces, as for instance,

gravitation or Marangoni forces. In lubrication theory the latter also takes the form of a body

force althought physically it acts at the free surface only. The driving is top-down because the

force is fed into the system on the macroscopic scale and causes motion on all scales down to the

microscale. One of our main results is that this type of driving cannot be described by the present

theory because the balance of the viscous term and the capillary term in Eq. (6) does not account

for the driving force. Speciﬁcally, it is not possible to use the solution of Eq. (6) in terms of Airy

functions to describe droplets sliding down an incline driven by gravity. This is already obvious

from the fact that for gravity-driven drops the advancing dynamic contact angle is larger than the

receding one49,50 contrary to the characteristics of the mesoscopic solution given by Eqs. (11) and

(12).

On the contrary, driving the droplets by a wettability gradient is bottom-up because the force

is fed into the system on the microscale and causes motion up to the mesoscale (in our terms, no

macroscale exists in this case because the macroscale is deﬁned by the scale of the body forces

that are absent by deﬁnition of the problem).

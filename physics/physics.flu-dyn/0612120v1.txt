A model for the large-scale circulation in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection

A model for the large-scale circulation (LSC) dynamics of turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection
is presented. It consists of two stochastic ordinary diﬀerential equations motivated by the Navier-
Stokes equation, one each for the strength and the azimuthal orientation of the LSC. Stochastic
forces represent phenomenologically the action of the turbulent ﬂuctuations on the LSC. Without
adjustable parameters, the model yields a meandering LSC with occasional rotations, and with
more rare cessations that occur a few times per day – diﬀering only by about a factor of two
from experiment. Also as in experiments, the distribution of LSC orientation-change is uniform for
cessations and a power law for rotations.

Rayleigh B´enard convection (RBC) consists of a ﬂuid-
ﬁlled container heated from below [1]. It is well-known
that cylindrical containers with aspect ratio Γ
≃
1 (D is the sample diameter and L the height) have a
large-scale circulation (LSC), also known as the “mean
wind” [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The LSC consists of
warm up-ﬂowing and cool down-ﬂowing ﬂuid on opposite

sides of the sample.
has an orientation θ0 that undergoes azimuthal diﬀusion
[10, 11]. An interesting aspect is that θ0, in addition to
its diﬀusive meandering, undergoes relatively rapid os-
cillations [8] and, on somewhat longer time scales, expe-
riences spontaneous and erratic re-orientations through
an azimuthal displacement ∆θ.
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
One mechanism for re-orientation is an azimuthal rota-
tion of the entire structure without much change of the
ﬂow speed. [12] Rotations lead to a power-law distribu-
tion of ∆θ, with small rotations more likely than large
ones. [10, 14] The other mechanism is a cessation of the
ﬂow in which it stops brieﬂy and then starts up again
in a random new orientation, resulting in a uniform dis-
tribution of ∆θ [10, 14]. Aside from its fundamental in-
terest, the phenomenon of reorientation is important for
instance because it occurs in natural convection of the at-
mosphere [16], and because it is responsible for changes
in the orientation of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld when it occurs
in Earth’s outer core [17].

Several models were proposed to reproduce the LSC
dynamics. Those of Sreenivasan et al.
[7] and Benzi
[18] were based on similar stochastic equations that were
chosen so as to produce the desired reversal events. The
equations yielded two opposite stable ﬂow directions with
transitions between them, in qualitative agreement with
experiments by Sreenivasan et al.
[7]. However, such
local ﬂow reversals usually are not cessations or large ro-
tations; they are equivalent to crossings of the LSC orien-
tation past a ﬁxed angle and correspond mostly to small
orientation changes, or “jitter” [10]. Another model, by
Fontenele Araujo et al. [19], was based on a deterministic
force balance between buoyancy and drag. It produced

LSC reversals (∆θ = π), but did not consider azimuthal
motion and thus did not reproduce the azimuthal dynam-
ics seen in experiments. Finally, a deterministic model
based on the Boussinesq equations with slip boundary
conditions and for ellipsoidal sample geometries was de-
veloped by Resagk et al.
[20]. It neglected dissipation
and diﬀusion, but added these eﬀects phenomenologically
after the model was derived. The result was a set of ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) with several parame-
ters that could be tuned to produce a LSC with various
dynamical states, including oscillations and chaotic me-
andering; but to our knowledge the existence and statis-
tics of rotations and cessations were not explored.

We present a model consisting of two coupled stochas-
tic ODEs, one for the speed (or “strength”) of the LSC
and the other for the azimuthal LSC orientation. We
retained the physically important terms of the Navier-
Stokes (NS) equation and took volume averages. The
resulting deterministic ODE for the LSC strength rep-
resents the balance between buoyancy and drag forces
and has two ﬁxed points; one stable and the other, corre-
sponding to cessations, unstable. It diﬀers from the equa-
tions of Refs. [7] and [18] in that the nonlinearity is of
order 3/2 rather than of the more usual cubic order. The
second ODE describes the azimuthal motion of the LSC
which is suppressed by its angular momentum. The dy-
namics of the model arises from the addition of stochas-
tic forces that represent in a phenomenological sense the
action of the turbulent ﬂuctuations that exist through-
out the system interior. We determined some parameters
of the model from independent measurements that did
not involve reorientations per se, determined others from
theory, and did not adjust any of them arbitrarily. An
interesting physical aspect of the model is that the an-
gular momentum of the LSC hinders reorientations when
the ﬂow is vigorous; when the ﬂow becomes feeble, then
the angular momentum is small and the stochastic forces
are able to cause signiﬁcant orientation change. We note
that the model of Resagk et al.
[20] suggests that the
angular momentum of the LSC also plays an important

role in its oscillations. Our model does not produce LSC
oscillations, but yields cessations that are only slightly
more frequent than the experimental observation of one
or two per day [10, 14]. In agreement with experiment
[10, 14] it gives a uniform probability distribution p(∆θ)
for cessations and a power-law distribution for rotations.
For the LSC strength we consider the velocity com-
ponent uφ, where φ is an angle that sweeps the plane
of the LSC, and describes it without azimuthal motion.
One expects the acceleration to be due to a balance be-
tween buoyancy and drag forces. Thus we include in the
NS equation for uφ only the acceleration, buoyancy, and
viscous drag terms, and neglect the nonlinear term [21]:

˙uφ = gα(T

T0) + ν

uφ .

Here α is the isobaric thermal expansion coeﬃcient, g the
acceleration of gravity, and ν the kinematic viscosity.

To obtain a model in the form of an ODE that de-
scribes the ﬂow with only a few variables, we take a global
average over the ﬁeld variables that retains the essential
physics. To carry out the average, we consider the exper-
imental observation [10, 11, 14, 22] that the temperature
of the LSC at the side wall at mid-height can be written
as

T = T0 + δ cos(θ0

where the temperature amplitude δ represents the
strength of the LSC, and where θ0 is its azimuthal ori-
entation. The buoyancy acts on the entire LSC and is
proportional δ. The proﬁle is taken to be given by Eq. 2,
and proportional to the cylindrical radius r. The velocity
is assumed to be linear in r and a step function in θ. Note
that these assumptions about the geometry of the ﬂow
only aﬀect the numerical prefactors in the equations, and
not the functional form. The drag is assumed to occur in
U/λ2 (U is the
the viscous boundary layers, so
maximum speed near the side wall, λ is the boundary-
U L/ν
layer width), where λ = (L/2)
is the instantaneous Reynolds number). The volume av-
erage requires another factor of 6λ/L since the drag is
mainly in the boundary layers. These approximations
result in the volume-averaged equation

Next we make the assumption that the amplitude δ is
instantaneously proportional to the speed U , since both
variables are measures of the LSC strength. To determine
the proportionality, we ﬁnd the steady-state solution

of Eq. 3. Here Re is the normal steady-state Reynolds
number. In the dynamical equation, we allow the drag to
depend on the instantaneous value Re,i, so the drag term
instantaneously scales as U 3/2. We substitute Eq. 4 into
Eq. 3, combine all parameters into two constants, and
add a noise term that represents the turbulent ﬂuctua-
tions of the ﬂow to get the Langevin equation

In the absence of the noise term Eq. 5 has two ﬁxed
points, one unstable at δ = 0 and one stable when δ = δ0.
In the stochastic equation this feature reproduces some
of the dominating behavior of the LSC; the LSC spends
most of its time meandering near the stable ﬁxed point
at δ0, but occasionally it ceases when ﬂuctuations drive
it close to δ = 0.

To study the predictions of the model, we consider the
1010 and σ = 4.4 for a sample with
example R = 1.1
L = 24.76 cm [23]. Measurements yielded δ0 = 0.25
K and Re = 3700 [22]. From Eq. 6 one has τδ = 85
s and δ0 = 0.10 K. For δ0 theory and experiment are
in order of magnitude agreement, which is as much as
we can expect given the approximations made in the
model derivation. For numerical calculations we adopt
the experimental value because it presumably is more
appropriate for the physical system. To gain information
about the noise intensity, we examined the experimental

determine the diﬀusivity of θ0; but in the present case the

The second Langevin equation describes the azimuthal
motion. The main driving force is the turbulent noise.
We estimated that angular momentum of the LSC in the
φ coordinate damps the relatively slow azimuthal motion
much more than the viscous drag across the boundary
layer near the side wall. The physical explanation is that
a rotating body has some stability due to its angular
momentum and requires a larger torque to rotate in an
orthogonal direction than a non-rotating body. This phe-
nomenon is represented by the transport term in the NS
equation. Thus, neglecting the drag term (and Earth’s
Coriolis force; see [11]), we have

A volume average gives (1/3)L¨θ0 =
(2/3)U ˙θ0 . The
angular momentum leads to an eﬀective damping that is
proportional to the wind strength U , which is important
for understanding the azimuthal dynamics during cessa-
tions. Again, we convert U to δ, combine the remaining
parameters to get a new constant, and add a noise term
representing turbulent ﬂuctuations to get

The two stochastic ODEs Eqs. 5 and 9 are our model
for the LSC dynamics. Using the experimentally deter-
mined values of δ0, Dδ and D ˙
θ and predictions for τδ and
τ ˙θ based on the measured value of Re discussed above,
they can be integrated to get time series for δ and θ0. We
used a simple ﬁrst-order Euler method to solve the equa-
tions stepwise with a time step shorter than the smallest
θ of the system. Figure 1 shows a simulated
timescale τ ˙
time series over about one day. One can see, as we ex-
pected, that the LSC amplitude δ is stable with an occa-
sional cessation where the amplitude drops to zero. From
much longer simulations we found that cessations occur
about 3.8 times per day, which (we presume because the
relation ∆V
Dδ is not satisﬁed very well) is a factor
of 3.7 less than the result from Eq. 7 and about twice the
frequency measured experimentally [10]. Considering the

approximations made in the model derivation, we regard
this as very satisfying agreement with experiment.

Figure 1 shows that the orientation meanders as ex-
pected, but one must look on a shorter time scale to
see the details of the dynamics. Thus, Fig. 2 shows a
shorter section of the same time series that contains a
cessation. One sees how δ gradually drops to zero, then
grows back up again over a few hundred seconds, just as
observed experimentally [10]. The time series for θ0 is
interesting because there is a large change in θ0 during
the cessation, again as seen experimentally [10]. Equa-
tion 9 for the azimuthal motion implies that, when δ and
thus the angular momentum are small during cessations,
the damping term becomes small so the turbulent ﬂuctu-
ations are free to accelerate the LSC to large azimuthal
rotation rates. When the LSC is strong, i. e. δ
δ0, then
the larger angular momentum of the LSC supresses the
azimuthal rotation. This inverse relationship between δ
and ˙θ0 was observed in experiments [10, 14] but had not
been explained by any previous model.

In order to determine the statistics of cessations and
rotations, we analyzed the simulated time series using the
same algorithms as those applied before to experimental
data [10, 14]. Figure 3a shows the probability distribu-

tion p(∆θ) of the orientation change ∆θ during cessa-
tions. The results from the simulations are consistent
with a uniform distribution p(∆θ) = 1/π, in agreement
with the experiments [10, 14]. This is an important result
that no model had predicted before, either because the
θ dependence was not contained in it, [7, 18] or because
it was assumed that cessations would result in a reversal
of the ﬂow direction, i.e. ∆θ = π [19], or because the
issue was not addressed [20]. The angular momentum
that usually suppresses the azimuthal motion of the LSC
is reduced during cessations, allowing turbulent ﬂuctu-
ations to azimuthally rotate the LSC freely. For large
enough noise strengths, the azimuthal distance traveled
is large over the duration of the cessation, and this results
in a ﬁnal orientation independent of the orientation be-
fore the cessation, which explains the uniform p(∆θ). We
also ﬁnd rotations in the model to result from a similar
mechanism. Rotations typically occur when the angu-
lar momentum of the LSC is still large, so the azimuthal
rotation in limited. This results in a monotonically de-
creasing distribution of ∆θ for rotations. However, the
azimuthal rotation rate can become large even when δ
is somewhat lower than normal, resulting in more rota-
tions, and in particular more large rotations, than would
be expected from purely Brownian noise with constant
damping coeﬃcient [14]. The simulation results can be
represented reasonably well by a power law for p(∆θ) as
shown in Fig 3b, in qualitative agreement with the ex-
periments [14].

To summarize, we derived a dynamical model moti-
vated by the Navier-Stokes equations to describe the LSC
in terms of two variables: its strength δ and its azimuthal
orientation θ0. The model used as input four parame-
ters that were determined from independent experimen-
tal measurements, and required no adjustable parame-
ters. Each term in the equations has a clear physical
meaning. The model produces a stable LSC with occa-
sional cessations and rotations, and p(∆θ) is in agreement
with experiments for both processes. The frequency of

4

cessations can be calculated based on an analogy to the
Arrhenius-Kramers problem. The azimuthal dynamics
during cessations can be understood in terms of the an-
gular momentum of the LSC which suppresses azimuthal
motion driven by turbulent ﬂuctuations. The model also
can reproduce other results for the LSC dynamics in good
agreement with experiments; these are to be studied thor-
oughly in future work.

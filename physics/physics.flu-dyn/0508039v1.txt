Generalizations of Kadanoﬀ’s solution of the Saﬀman–Taylor problem in a
wedge

Irina Markina, Rodrigo Meneses, and Alexander Vasil’ev

Abstract. We consider a zero-surface-tension two-dimensional Hele-Shaw ﬂow in an inﬁnite wedge. There
exists a self-similar interface evolution in this wedge, an analogue of the famous Saﬀman-Taylor ﬁnger in
a channel, exact shape of which has been given by Kadanoﬀ. One of the main features of this evolution
is its inﬁnite time of existence and stability for the Hadamard ill-posed problem. We derive several exact
solutions existing inﬁnitely by generalizing and perturbing the one by Kadanoﬀ.

1. Introduction

The Hele-Shaw problem involves two inmiscible Newtonian ﬂuids that interact in a narrow gap between
two parallel plates. One of them is of higher viscosity and the other is eﬀectively inviscid. The model under
consideration is valid when surface-tension eﬀects in the plane of the cell are negligible. In the most of
the cases it is known that when a ﬂuid region is contracting, a ﬁnite time blow-up can occur, in which a
cusp forms in the free surface. The solution does not exist beyond the time of blow-up. However, Saﬀman
and Taylor in 1958 [13] discovered the long time existence of a continuum set of long bubbles within a
receding ﬂuid between two parallel walls in a Hele-Shaw cell that further have been called the Saﬀman-
Taylor ﬁngers. It is worthy to mention that the ﬁrst non-trivial explicit solution in the circular geometry
has been given by Polubarinova-Kochina and Galin in 1945 [5, 12]. They also have proposed a complex
variable approach, that nowadays is one of the principle tools to treat the Hele-Shaw problem in the plane
geometry (see, e.g., [8, 14]) . Following these ﬁrst steps several other non-trivial exact solutions have been
obtained (see, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11]). Through the similarity in the governing equations (Hele-Shaw
and Darcy), these solutions can be used to study the models of saturated ﬂows in porous media. Another
typical scenario is given by Witten-Sander’s diﬀusion-limited-aggregation (DLA) model (see, e.g., [1]).
In both cases the motion takes place in a Laplacian ﬁeld (pressure for viscous ﬂuid and random walker’s
probability of visit for DLA). One of the ways, in which several new exact solution have been obtained, is to
perturb known solutions. For example, Howison [7] suggested perturbations of the Saﬀman-Taylor ﬁngers
. Recently,
that led him to new ﬁngering solutions keeping the same asymptotic behavior as time t
Hele-Shaw ﬂows and Saﬀman-Taylor ﬁngering phenomenon have been studied intensively in wedges (see,
e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11] nad the references therein). In particular, Kadanoﬀ [10] suggested a self-similar
interface evolution between two walls in a Hele-Shaw cell expressed explicitly by a rather simple parametric

function with a logarithmic singularity at one of the walls. By this note we perturb Kadanoﬀ’s solution
and give new explicit solutions with similar asymptotics.

2. Mathematical model

We suppose that the viscous ﬂuid occupies a simply connected domain Ω(t) in the phase z-plane whose
boundary Γ(t) consists of two walls Γ1(t) and Γ2(t) of the corner and a free interface Γ3(t) between them
at a moment t. The inviscid ﬂuid (or air) ﬁlls the complement to Ω(t). The simplifying assumption of
constant pressure at the interface between the ﬂuids means that we omit the eﬀect of surface tension. The
velocity must be bounded close to the contact point that yields the contact angle between the walls of
the wedge and the moving interface to be π/2 (see Figure 1). A limiting case corresponds to one ﬁnite
contact point and the other tends to inﬁnity. By a shift we can place the point of the intersection of the
wall extensions at the origin. To simplify matter, we set the corner of angle α between the walls so that
(0, π]. In the zero-surface-tension
the positive real axis x contains one of the walls and ﬁx this angle as α

This presents a case (apart from the trivial one) of the long existence of the solution in the problem with

4. Perturbations of Kadanoﬀ ’s solution

Kadanoﬀ’s solution (10) can be thought of as a logarithmic perturbation of a circular evolution with
4Qt/πζ. A simple way to generalize the solution (10) is to perturb another

The functions a(t), d(t) are to be chosen such that equation (7) is satisﬁed for the moving interface as
well as the conditions of impermeability and univalence hold. The local univalence is followed from the
ﬁrst restriction a(t)/d(t) < 1. Substituting H into equation (7) and comparing the Fourier coeﬃcients, we

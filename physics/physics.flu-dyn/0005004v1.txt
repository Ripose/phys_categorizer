Abstract

It is shown using experimental and numerical data that within the
traditional inertial subrange deﬁned by where the third order structure
function is linear that the higher order structure function scaling expo-
nents for longitudinal and transverse structure functions converge only
over larger scales, r > rS, where rS has scaling intermediate between η
and λ as a function of Rλ. Below these scales, scaling exponents can-
not be determined for any of the structure functions without resorting
to procedures such as extended self-similarity (ESS). With ESS, diﬀer-
ent longitudinal and transverse higher order exponents are obtained that
are consistent with earlier results. The relationship of these statistics to
derivative and pressure statistics, to turbulent structures and to length
scales is discussed.

Introduction

An important tool in understanding intermittency in turbulence has been the
exponents ζp of power laws for the velocity structure functions. The longitudinal

1

structure functions are

p (r) =< (u(x + r) − u(x))p >∼ rζL
SL

p

(1)

where −→u and −→r are in the same direction. Their measurement requires only a
single hot wire probe that can, through the Taylor frozen turbulence assumption,
determine one velocity component u as a function of the parallel spatial direction
r and thus ﬁnd the SL
p at high Reynolds numbers. Using crossed-wire probes,
one can also obtain reliable, high Reynolds number measurements of transverse
p (r), where −→u and −→r are orthogonal, and their exponents
structure functions ST
ζT
p . There are also mixed structure functions containing both longitudinal and
transverse components.

The relationship between the ζp and intermittency [1] is in deviations of the
the exponents ζp from their Gaussian or classical values of ζp = p/3, where
ζ2 ≈ 2/3 and ζ3 = 1 are expected for an energy cascade. In the presence of
intermittency, ζp < p/3 for p > 3 is expected. Furthermore, it has generally
been believed that all of the ζL,T
of a given order p should be the same in the
inﬁnite Reynolds number limit. This is closely related to the reﬁned similarity
hypothesis (RSH) which assumes that the only information that can aﬀect the
statistics on a given scale r is the ﬂuctuations in the energy cascade ǫr through
that scale. Details about either the large scale forcing or the dissipative struc-
tures should be irrelevant in this picture. Measurements [2] have conﬁrmed RSH
as it relates dissipation to longitudinal statistics.

p

p < ζL

More recently, moderate Reynolds numbers simulations and experiments
[3, 4] have found, with the help of the extended self-similarity hypothesis [5],
that ζT
p for p > 3. This has been now been conﬁrmed over all Reynolds
numbers simulated [6] or observed [7] to date. If longitudinal and transverse
statistics are diﬀerent, then the statistics of strain, that is dissipation ǫr, and the
statistics of of vorticity, call it Ωr for its relationship to the enstrophy, should
be diﬀerent. Since ζT
p , it implies that vorticity is more intermittent than
strain. This possibility has been suggested by recent numerical results [6] that
show that dissipation and enstrophy statistics scale as RSH predicts, but with
separate distributions. This result implies that when the nonlinear coupling is
written as a convolution in Fourier space that not only the velocity magnitude,
but also the velocity phase, what makes the transfer of Ωr diﬀerent than ǫr, is
important. Related to this, if the dissipation-dissipation correlation and its Ωr
counterpart go as

p < ζL

< ǫxǫx+r > ∼ rµ

and < ΩxΩx+r > ∼ rµΩ

(2)

then diﬀerent Ωr statistics implies that µΩ 6= µ. Experimentally, µ ≈ 0.25
[21] has been conﬁrmed by the latest measurements and simulations [22, 10, 8],
although lower Reynolds number measurements tend to give µ = 0.5. µΩ 6= µ
is found in one numerical result [8].

2

It will be shown here that diﬀerent longitudinal and transverse statistics
suggest the existence of a crossover length scale within the inertial subrange.
That is a length scale distinct from the large length scale L or a multiple of
the dissipation or Kolmogorov scale η, and maybe the order of the intermediate
Taylor microscale λ, where the Taylor microscale Reynolds number and λ are
deﬁned as

U

(3)

Rλ =

U λ
ν

where λ =

< (du/dx)2. >1/2

Rλ is the deﬁnition of the Reynolds number that appears to give uniform scaling
in a variety of diﬀerent ﬂows and is related to the large scale Reynolds number
by Rλ ∼ (R = U L/ν)1/2. The Kolmogorov scale is related to λ by

η = (ν/ǫ)1/4 ∼ λR−1/2

λ

(4)

where ν is viscosity and ǫ is the dissipation rate.

In order to discern if there is some crossover length scale for some struc-
ture function within the inertial subrange and determine if there are indeed
diﬀerent longitudinal and transverse exponents, a long inertial subrange and
clean data are needed. Numerical simulations do not have this range, but if run
suﬃciently long give clean data and more ﬂexibility. Observations can provide
more dynamic range, but with more limited types of data. This paper will use
both experimental and numerical data to try to present a more complete pic-
ture than either measurements or simulations alone of what evidence there is
for diﬀerent longitudinal and transverse statistics and its implications. Exper-
imental data will be used to indicate the high Reynolds number trends, then
analysis from forced numerical turbulence in a box at Rλ = 262 on a 5123 mesh
and Rλ = 390 on a 10243 mesh will be presented, with most of the discussion
related to the Rλ = 262 calculation. It will be shown that if the same inertial
range scaling analysis deﬁned by the experiments is applied to the simulations,
then the trends in the lower Reynolds number simulations are consistent with
the experiments and clearly demonstrate a trend where simple scaling breaks
down at many multiples of the Kolmogorov scale within the traditional inertial
subrange, and that this scale appears to increase with Reynolds number.

This paper will be organized as follows. First, constraints on and relation-
ships between structure functions will be discussed. Recent results on structure
function and pressure structure function scaling will be discussed in the context
that diﬀerent scalings for the same order imply the existence of a statistically
signﬁcant length scale within the inertial subrange where scaling properties of
at least some structure functions could change. Next, there will be a discussion
of existing experimental and observational results before showing new analysis
of experimental data up to Rλ = 3200. The analysis will use SL,T
and S3 to
deﬁne the minimum limits over which inertial subrange scaling analysis can be
applied before the results for the ζL,T
for p = 4 and 6 are presented. Then the
numerical analysis will be presented in a similar manner.

2 Constraints

This section discusses kinematical constraints upon structure functions, related
quantities, and what can be measured. There are only a few hard constraints
for the scaling of small p structure functions. For p = 2, assuming isotropy and
homogeniety and for a long enough inertial subrange, ζL
2 is expected. The
classical value for ζ2 is 2/3 (5), which is closely related to assuming that the
energy spectrum goes as

2 = ζT

E(k) = ckǫ2/3k−5/3

(5)

where cK is the experimentally determined Kolmogorov constant and ǫ is the
equivalently either the rate of energy dissipation or the rate of energy transfer to
small scales. With crossed wires, only one-dimensional longitudinal or transverse
spectra can be found, but with a numerical simulation the full energy spectrum
can be obtained in three-dimensions. An example from the 5123 forced data set
to be discussed is shown in Figure 1. This spectrum is found between a lower
wavenumber, large-scale, forcing or integral scale L and a high wavenumber,
small-scale, dissipation scale η = (ν/ǫ)1/4, with kη = 1/η.

The theoretical basis for predicting a -5/3 spectrum is the presumption of
a local, uniform energy cascade. There is no constraint requiring -5/3 or the
corresponding ζ2 = 2/3 for structure functions and corrections to the ζ2 =
2/3 are claimed [9]. However, no corrections to a -5/3 energy spectrum have
been seen in numerical spectrum such as Figure 1 and for the largest range of
scales observationally [10]. How could two supposedly equivalent measures of
turbulent scaling, the energy spectrum and the 2nd order structure functions,
yield two inconsistent results concerning intermittency? A suggestion below is
that dissipation range eﬀects on SL

2 are more persistent than thought.

For p = 3, by balancing transfer and dissipation terms in the Karman-
Howarth equation [11, 12], ζ3 ≡ 1 is expected. This is the only ﬁxed constraint
on the ζp for isotropic, homogeneous turbulence regardless of intermittency and
yields Kolmogorov’s 4/5 law for S3(r)

S3(r) = −

4
5

ǫr

(6)

However, linear in r behavior is never observed exactly (see discussion with
ﬁgure 2). This eﬀect has been quantiﬁed [13] and it was shown that the peak of
−S3/r, after being compensated for the eﬀects of forcing and dissipation, has
a Reynolds number dependence like ls/L ∼ R−3/5
λ . This
could suggest the existence of a dynamically signiﬁcant position in the inertial
subrange that does not scale with either the small Kolmogorov scale or the large
scale and has been interpreted in terms of an enstrophy production argument
[14].

While it is diﬃcult to obtain a clean power law for p = 3, it is even harder
to get convincing power laws when plotting Sp versus r for p > 3. A device

The dissipation spectrum ǫ(k) = νk2E(k) with a peak at k = 34 is shown.
Resolution is determined by the ratio of the wavenumber of the peak of the
dissipation spectrum (here k ≈ kη/30 = 34) to kmax. Experience has shown
that a ratio of at least 5 provides adequate resolution.

that has been used to determine higher order ζp is to make the assumption that
even if −S3 ∼ r is not exact, if it is assumed to be exact then much stronger
power laws for the Sp, p ≥ 4, can be obtained by plotting Sp versus −S3 rather
than versus r. This is known as extended self-similarity or ESS [5]. Another
way of looking at ESS is that the Sp are not true power laws all the way to the
dissipation scale η, but only for r > Aη, where A is large, and ESS allows one
to extend scaling much closer to η. However, there is a question of how much
of this is a mirage because the ESS scaling exponents as r → 0 are trivially the
classical values of p/3. The additional length scale Aη probably should have no
dynamical signiﬁcance since it is a multiple of η, as will be discussed in section
3.

For p ≥ 4, there are no rigorous constraints that the longitudinal and trans-
verse structure functions should have the same ζp. However, it has been shown
−→
[15] that when all components of the velocity ﬁeld −→u and all directions of
∂x
are considered that there are four rotationally invariant combinations of fourth-
order derivative correlations that can be written entirely in terms of the strain
eij and the vorticity ωi and have been discussed in detail [16].

Under the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy Fe is equivalent to the
longitudinal fourth-order derivative ﬂatness F L
4 that can be measured with a
single hot-wire probe and is related to the r → 0 limit of SL
4 (r). To determine
the other irrotational ﬂatnesses as functions of Rλ can only be done at low
Reynolds numbers with complicated probes [17] or simulations [16, 18], which
suggest that each has its own scaling with Reynolds number.

With a crossed-wire probe, higher Reynolds number observations of the scal-
ing of ﬂatnesses related to the r → 0 limit of the transverse and mixed structure
functions could be determined. In addition to

these are

which can be related to combinations of the irrotational ﬂatnesses (7). The scal-
ing of F M
4 should be dominated by their most intermittent components,
which the analysis of the irrotational components indicates is Fω [16].

Generalized structure functions should involve not only more than one ve-
locity direction, but also more than one spatial position and direction. All of
the structure functions discussed so far involve diﬀerent velocity components,
but only one spatial position and direction.
In this class would be included
−→
structure functions where the angle between −→u and
∂x is not 0 or 90◦ [19].
The diﬀerent rotationally invariant ﬂatnesses (7) involve diﬀerent velocity and
spatial directions, but only one position, r = 0. It should be noted that a new
type of structure function that uses two spatial positions in the same direction,
has recently come into use in conjunction with fusion models [20]. These are
similar to the dissipation-dissipation correlation functions < ǫxǫx+r > where
the two distances would be 0 (the derivative for dissipation) and the separation
r between the two locations of dissipation ǫ.

While generalized structure functions could only be completely determined
by numerical simulations or complicated probes at low Reynolds numbers, some
insight might be gained by considering whether their number could be reduced.
First, a way of systematically writing these down is needed [24]. However,
unlike the way all fourth order derivative correlations can be expressed in terms
of just four irrotational correlations, no simple reduction to a small number of
fourth order structure functions has been found. What can be said is that if this
number could be reduced, it would have to satisfy two rotational groups, one for
position and the other for the velocity components [25]. The full group would
correspond to the spin plus angular momentum group in quantum mechanics.
Even if such a reduction does not exist, one would expect some general properties
to hold among all fourth-order structure functions. For example, if there is
a subrange where the longitudinal and transverse structure functions, SL
4 (r)
and ST
4 (r), do have the same scaling, then maybe all fourth-order structure
functions, including those related to fusion rules, are related in a similar manner.
Or if there is a subrange where SL
4 (r), do not have the same scaling,
then relationships such as the fusion rules should not apply.

4 (r) and ST

This leads us to three fourth-order structure functions measurable with
crossed wire probes, each corresponding to one of the three derivative ﬂatnesses
(8-10). The longitudinal, mixed and transverse fourth-order structure functions
are

SL
4 = Sℓℓℓℓ =< (u(x + r) − u(x))4 >

whose general moment form is given by eqns. 13.83-13.84 of [26]. However, the
general moment form in no more fundamental than (11) in terms of the full
rotational group. One would expect that if there are diﬀerent scalings for the
derivative ﬂatnesses (7) under Rλ, there should also be correspondingly diﬀerent

3 Why two length scales?

Another way of looking at the fourth-order velocity structure functions is to
consider the second order pressure structure function P2(r). This is related to
a combination of fourth-order velocity structure functions (11) by [27]

For the purposes here, the particular numerical prefactors are not important.
The point to be made is that if the fourth-order longitudinal and transverse
structure functions have diﬀerent scalings, then P2 should have diﬀerent scaling
4 ∼ rζ T
at the two ends of the inertial subrange. Assume that SL
with ζL
4 between these. Then for r small, P2 would

be dominated by the scaling of ST

length scale in the middle of the inertial subrange marking the separation be-
tween two regimes for the scaling of P2.

Related to P2(r) is the pressure spectrum Sp(k). It has been suggested [28]
that the dependence of P2(k) on the spectral equivalents of the dissipation-
dissipation correlation function < ǫxǫx+r > and also < ΩxΩx+r > and a cross
correlation < Ωxǫx+r > places a kinematical constraint upon exponents for these
correlations, and therefore the related fourth-order velocity structure functions.
The relation used to show this is

Sp(k) =

ǫ2
4k4ν2 [Eǫ(k) + EΩ(k) − EM (k)]

(13)

where Eǫ(k), EΩ(k), and EM (k) are the spectral versions of < ǫxǫx+r >, ν2 <
ΩxΩx+r >, and ν < Ωxǫx+r > respectively. If each goes as

Eǫ(k) = Cǫǫ2k−1(kL)−µǫ

(14)

with corresponding µΩ and µM for EΩ(k) and EM (k), it is then argued that
unless µǫ = µΩ = µM for all k there will be divergences in Sp(k) as ν → 0.
This is a reasonable conclusion for k → 0. However, for k > kλ ∼ 1/λ where
k4
λν2 ∼ O(1), there is no need for this requirement. Therefore, there could be

8

a kinematical constraint for 0 < k < kλ requiring that µǫ = µΩ = µx. Relating
this to physical space, there would be a constraint that ζL = ζT = ζM as
r −→ 0 and Rλ −→ ∞. This will be shown to be consistent with the analysis in
sections (4,5). For kλ < k < kη, there would be no constraint, so that it would
be possible that µǫ 6= µΩ 6= µM and ζL 6= ζT 6= ζM as r −→ η, which is also
indicated by the analysis here. What would be most satisfying would be if the
pressure spectrum itself showed a clear break near k = 1/λ. This has now been
found in the pressure analysis of the 10243 data to be discussed here [29].

4 New experimental evidence

There have been numerous experimental and observation studies of turbulence
designed to determine the scaling of structure functions and related measures
of intermittency such as the dissipation-dissipation correlation function (2).
However, careful examination raises several questions. First, while the high-
est Reynolds number observations [7] do ﬁnd that ζT (p) 6= ζL(p), when ESS is
used, compared with lower Reynolds number results, the diﬀerence is noticeably
less. This suggests that in the very high Reynolds number limit the diﬀerence
could go to zero. On the other hand, ESS might be giving a false impression of
good scaling since the ratios ST
p (r) as functions of r do not show good
scaling behavior to as small a scale as plotting with ESS does. A recurrent
limitation is that scales below λ in experimental and observational analysis are
usually not shown, perhaps because it is felt that the small scales are less reli-
able. For example, the dissipation-dissipation correlation function exponent is
expected to be µ ≈ 0.25 from the observed value of ζL
6 ≈ 1.78. This is con-
ﬁrmed by several high Reynolds number measurements ([10, 22] and references
therein), but only for r ≥ λ. It is noted [22] that lower Rλ experiments tend
to give µ ≈ 0.5. One moderate Reynolds number (Rλ = 400) experiment for a
circular jet [23] that shows µ ≈ 0.2 for r ≥ λ, also shows a breakdown in scaling
of < ǫxǫx+r > for r < λ that could be with the origin of µ ≈ 0.5 at low Rλ.

p (r)/SL

The new experimental analysis comes from data from two experiments at
the Moscow wind tunnel that has been used to investigate a number of funda-
mental issues involving turbulent spectra and structure functions [10, 30]. The
two experiments are for a mixing layer ML at Rλ=2100 and a return chan-
nel RC at Rλ=3200, which are the highest Reynolds number laboratory data
sets available with both longitudinal and transverse velocities. The advantage
of an experiment over atmospheric observations is that an experiment oﬀers
more controlled conditions, which could be especially important for determin-
ing transverse structure functions since any inherent anisotropy in the ﬂow could
aﬀect their values. With respect to this, an important point to remember in the
following discussion is that the ML data set is very anisotropic and RC data set
is nearly completely isotropic. Therefore, only the RC, Rλ = 3200 experimental
data can be directly compared to the isotropic numerical data to be presented.

The ML data set is included to show that most of the relevant properites also
appear when there is anisotropy. Extended self-similarity will not be used in
order to emphasize the regimes with simple scaling and where this breaks down
within the inertial subrange. It will be shown that the scalings of all of the
measured higher-order structure functions change within the inertial subrange.

Figure 2 shows the third-order longitudinal structure functions −S3(r) di-

transverse-only structure functions are zero. Figure 2 uses arrows to indicate
the inertial subrange based upon the regime over which −S3(r)/r is constant for
ML and RC. For ML and RC respectively, at the large scale arrows are lengths
rL = L/5 and L/6 and at the small scales lengths rη = 30η and 25η. Fig-
ure 3 shows the second-order longitudinal SL
2 (r) structure
functions for ML and RC. For SL
2 (r), at large r there is scaling out to an rL con-

sistent with rL from S3(r) in Figure 2. In addition, there is a new large length
that we will call r4/3 < rL over which the isotropic relation ST
2 (r)
holds. r4/3 is smaller than the range over which the longitudinal second order
structure function SL
2 has good scaling behavior, which is roughly out to rL,
but is consistent with the maximum r for which the transverse second order
structure function ST
2 has good scaling. For ML and RC, r4/3 = L/30 and L/25
respectively. The small length scale rη is roughly where the one must begin
to apply extended self-similarity, ESS, (section 2) if one is to get good scaling
relationships for the higher order longitudinal structure functions down to the
Kolmogorov scale η. The reason rη is being introduced is to clearly indicate
that any new length scale between rη and r4/3 or rL is fully within the inertial
subrange. While r4/3 < rL at large scales, the range over which the 4/3 rule
for SL,T
(r) seems to ﬁt at small scales extends to r < rη. This would be con-
sistent with how extended self-similarity extends scaling regimes more into the
dissipation regime.

Figures 4(a-d) plot the logarithmic derivatives of the fourth and sixth-order
longitudinal and transverse structure functions. For fourth and higher order
structure functions there are no isotropy relationships that would require that
p have the same scaling as SL
ST
p over the entire inertial subrange, only the
pressure spectum argument (section 3) that ζT
4 for r > λ.
Consistent with the pressure spectrum argument, there is a regime in Figures
4(a-d) where the higher order structure functions do have the same scaling,
between two lengths, r4/3 and a new small length scale that we will call rS > rη.
Referring to Table 1 for ML (Rλ ≈ 2100) and RC (Rλ ≈ 3200), rS = 60η and
50η respectively while λ = R1/2
λ η ≈ 46η and 56η respectively. So rS ≈ λ, but
it is also roughly twice the value of rη. For r < rS, both ζT
p increase
rapidly from their r > rS constant values, with ζL

4 should equal ζL

p increasing the fastest.

p and ζL

This analysis shows a regime within even the rather strict deﬁnition of a
measurable inertial subrange deﬁned by rη < r < r4/3 where universal scaling
of longitudinal and transverse structure functions is found and therefore as-
sumptions of reﬁned self-similarity might apply. In addition, there is a regime
for r < rS where both the longitudinal and transverse scaling exponents diverge
from constant behavior. Praskovsky’s analysis shows that if scaling functions
were ﬁtted over the entire inertial subrange, that diﬀerent exponents for the
longitudinal and transverse structure functions would be found that would be
consistent with recent experiments [7] and simulations [3, 6].

5 New numerical evidence

To determine more clearly how signiﬁcant the diﬀerences between the longitu-
dinal and transverse structure functions are, it is necessary to see some trends.

excursions in the dissipation due to the initial conditions have dissappeared and
once the dissipation rate had settled to the point where it was varying by less
than 5% on the timescale of several eddy turnover times. Experience has shown
that this type of Gaussian white noise forcing yields stable statistics over a single
eddy turnover time. The 5123 simulations were not dealiased and the statistics
represent an average over 40 large scale eddy turnover times done on the Cray
T3D of the IDRIS Institute in Orsay, France. The 10243 calculations were done
on a Fujitsu VOO5999/56 at the Nagoya University Compution Center and
represent an average over 1.1 large scale eddy turnover times. How well the
10243 calculation satisﬁes isotropy relations for SL,T
(r) and S3(r) is discussed
elsewhere [31]. Figure 1 is the three-dimensional kinetic energy spectrum for
the 5123 calculation, showing a clear -5/3 regime. The Kolmogorov scale η is
half the mesh size η = ∆x/2. This is considered adequate resolution because
the peak of the dissipation spectrum, roughly where the -5/3 regime rolls over
into the dissipation regime, is at k ≈ kη/30 where kη = 2π/η.

In the experiments above, the original deﬁnition of an inertial subrange
placed the smallest scale useful for analysis at about rη = 25η, roughly the
scale associated with the peak of the dissipation spectrum. This deﬁnition of
rη would make it greater than λ for both simulations, which for Rλ = 262 is
λ ≈ 16η and for Rλ = 390 is λ ≈ 20η. Therefore, a quantitative means of
choosing rη must be determined that can be applied equally to simulations at
lower Reynolds number and the Rλ = 3200 experiments. A diﬃculty in choosing
a method is that the simulations are not at high enough a Reynolds number to
exhibit either a clearly deﬁned linear regime in S3 or a long regime where the
isotropy relationship between SL

2 is obeyed.

The problem is illustrated by Figure 5, which plots −S3(r)/(.8ǫr) and the

normalized form with the viscous correction

(15)

While the span over which DLLL(r) is 1 indicates that there is an energy cascade,
an inertial subrange over which −S3(r)/.8r is ﬂat as in the experiments in Figure
2 is not seen. Therefore, arbrtrarily a inertial subrange will be chosen as those
r where −S3(r)/(.8ǫr) > 0.8. This is the consistent with how rη was chosen
for the RC experiment and gives consistent values of rη for the 5123 and 10243
simulations and the RC experiment. Based upon Figure 5, an inertial subrange
can be deﬁned between r/η =19 and 193.

2 (r)/r2/3 is plotted twice, ﬁrst divided by 4/3 to demonstrate how
well the inertial range relation is obeyed and then divided by 2 to demonstrate
the approach to the dissipation range.

2 (r) ∼ 2SL

The 4/3 rule in Figure 6 is only approached at the largest scales, for r
greater than where −S3(r)/(.8ǫr) is greatest in Figure 5, which could be called
rmax. For r < rmax in Figure 6, the gradient of SL
2 (r) is slightly steeper than
the r2/3 prediction, which would be consistent with measurements of a small
correction over many years that is usually interpreted as due to intermittency.
However, ST

the derivative ﬂatness for a passive scalar θ

was similar to the vorticity ﬂatness Fω, that is zθ
larger than the exponent ze

(20)

Taking this analogy between the statistics of the scalar gradient and vorticity
a step further, if the scaling of F∇θ could be used as a tool for determining the
scaling of Fω, then high Reynolds experiments for temperature statistics [34]
could have been implying greater scaling exponents in the transverse derivative
correlations and greater deviations from classical structure function exponents
long before the new work with crossed-wire probes. However, without more
theoretical understanding and corroborating evidence from velocity structure
functions, these hints were not studied further.

p ≈ ζL

The theoretical, experimental and numerical discussion here replaces that
speculation with moderate to high Reynolds numbers experimental and numer-
ical data about the behavior of the transverse structure functions. The impor-
tant points are that for p > 3 that ζT
p for r > rS as Rλ −→ ∞, where
rS is further into the inertial subrange than expected, and that none of the ζp’s
show simple scaling behavior for r < rS. Table 1 shows δ4, δ6, rη, rS and λ
for the numerical cases of Rλ = 262 and Rλ = 390 and the experimental cases
ML (Rλ = 2100) and RC (Rλ = 3200). Between ML and RC, mixing layer
and return channel, the trend for rη and rS is opposite that between the much
lower Reynolds number simulations and the experiments. This is probably just
a reﬂection of the inﬂuence of anisotropy for ML. The overall trend supports
the existence of a length scale rS that is much larger than η, with the scaling
of rS as a function of Rλ intermediate between that for η and that for λ.

The theoretical discussion showed that this second small length scale would
not be expected if the energy cascade and the reﬁned similarity hypothesis
were controlled only by the statistics of the dissipation ǫ. For there to be a
dynamically signiﬁcant length scale within the inertial subrange, there must be

21

something in addition to ǫ controlling the cascade, the fundamental dissipation
mechanism must involve two length scales, or both. This paper addresses only
one kind of higher order statistic, the structure functions. Clearly a thorough
analysis of all higher order statistics, including pressure and the dissipation-
dissipation correlation function, needs to be done on available measurements
and simulations from the point of view of determining whether some length scale
of the order of the Taylor microscale has a role for them also. This has been
done for pressure spectra for the 10243 data set used here [29] and the results are
consistent with the existence of such a length scale separating spectral regimes
of -7/3 and -5/3.

Either numerically or observationally, consistent conditions over a wide range
of Reynolds numbers are necessary if any conclusions are to be drawn. This is
diﬃcult to obtain with atmospheric measurements. As an example, for one
series of atmospheric measurements over a wide range of Reynolds number,
< ǫxǫx+r > has been determined over the entire inertial subrange [10]. For
larger r, there is convergence to µ ≈ 0.2, but there is an enormous scatter
between diﬀerent measurements at smaller r so that any Rλ dependence in the
equivalent of rS for < ǫxǫx+r > would be diﬃcult to determine. Therefore, well-
controlled high Reynolds number experiments would be very useful. This could
also provide a motivation for doing a careful 20483 forced simulation, which is
now feasible.

If conﬁrmed, what could be the dynamical signiﬁcance of this crossover
length scale beyond just being an average between the integral scale and the
Kolmogorov scale? To date, no importance has been attached to the Taylor
microscale λ beyond that of an average. When the ﬁrst visualizations of vor-
tex ﬁlaments were done [16], one way of characterizing them was they had a
width the order of the Kolmogorov microscale and a length the order of the
Taylor microscale. However, in a 643 or 1283 DNS, it would be impossible to
determine whether the length was λ, a fraction of the size of the box, or just a
multiple of η. That is, the the radius of curvature might just be a multiple of η.
The highest resolution visualizations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence [35]
would support this scenario. That is, vortex ﬁlaments are observed, but they
do not snake through the entire domain and instead have a length that appears
to be a only a multiple of η. However, it can be argued that these are hy-
perviscous calculations that are predisposed to shortening the vortex ﬁlaments.
Furthermore, statistical models based strictly upon vortex ﬁlaments [32, 36] do
not seem capable of producing diﬀerent longitudinal and transverse scaling in
the high Reynolds number limit.

Therefore, it seems that some other type of dynamical object besides sim-
ple ﬁlaments would be needed if a theoretical basis for a second dynamically
signiﬁcant length scale is to be given. The only dynamical structure that has
been identiﬁed in either turbulence or idealized calculations of Navier-Stokes
and Euler that self-generates two small length scales is the structure found in
the interaction of two anti-parallel vortex tubes as the peak vorticity appears

22

to be developing a singularity [37]. However, the spectrum of this structure is
k−3, nowhere near k−5/3. So until high Reynolds number, very highly resolved
calculations are done for Navier-Stoke vortex reconnection, any connection be-
tween the properties of this structure and the scaling properties of turbulence
is pure conjecture.

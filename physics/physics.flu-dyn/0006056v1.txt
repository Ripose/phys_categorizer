Abstract

We discuss some properties of the intrinsically nonlinear Clebsch decomposition of a
vector ﬁeld into three scalars in d = 3. In particular, we note and account for the incom-
pleteness of this parameterization when attempting to use it in variational principles
involving Maxwell and Chern-Simons actions. Similarities with string decomposition
of metrics and their actions are also pointed out.

1 Clebsch Decomposition

The decomposition of vectors, as well as higher rank tensors, into irreducible parts is an
ancient and extremely useful tool in ﬂuid mechanics, electrodynamics, and gravity. The
longitudinal/transverse split separates an arbitrary d = 3 Euclidean vector into a scalar plus
a transverse vector,

A ≡ AL + AT = ∇λ + ∇ × WT ,

(1)

the vector WT being deﬁned up to a gradient. This linear orthogonal (upon spatial in-
tegration) parameterization naturally decomposes the 3-vector A into two, with 1 and 2
components, respectively. The completeness of (∇λ, WT ) in representing A is evidenced by
their uniqueness and invertibility (up to zero modes); in particular, any variational principle
yields the same Euler-Lagrange system whether we vary A or ﬁrst decompose it and then
vary (λ, WT ) separately. It is easy to check that since the ﬁeld strength is

B≡∇ × A = −∇2WT ,

which agrees completely with the variations of (3) with respect to (λ, WT ). The extra curl
that appears upon varying WT does not lose information: the curl is not a projector in the
space of transverse functions.

Another ancient parameterization, due to Clebsch [2], has long been used in ﬂuid me-
chanics [3], but is less familiar elsewhere. This decomposition is strikingly diﬀerent – it
involves only scalars rather than vectors and is nonlinear:

A = ∇ω + ǫabφa∇φb = ∇ω ′ + 2φ1∇φ2 , B = ∇ × A = ǫab∇φa × ∇φb .

(5)

The representations (1) and (5) share the pure gauge longitudinal term, but the role of WT
has been assumed by the pair of scalars φa, a=1,2; ǫab = −ǫba is the alternating symbol.
The construction of these scalars is described in the texts [4]; for the moment we note only
that the φa are not uniquely determined by A or B, nor can all (A,B) be put in this form
in terms of well-deﬁned scalar functions.

Our main interest is the particularly strange phenomenon (not hitherto noted to our
knowledge), that the Clebsch decomposition (5) is incomplete in the very concrete sense
that it fails (diﬀerently for each), when inserted into the two actions of (3) and varied with
respect to (ω, φa), to give the ﬁeld equations (4) implied by the generic A-variations. The
formal source of this incompleteness may be traced by comparing the decompositions (1)
and (5),

∇2λ = ∇ · A = ∇2ω + ǫabφa∇2φb ,

−∇2WT = ∇ × A = ǫab∇φa × ∇φb .

(6)

Note the demand of (6) that the curl of A be expressible as the cross-product of two gradients:
the curl must then lie on the line orthogonal to the plane they deﬁne. It follows that the
Chern-Simons action becomes a pure surface term,

Z A · ∇ × A = Z ∇ω · ∇ × A = Z ∇ · (ω∇ × A) .

(7)

In ω = 0 gauge, A is locally orthogonal to B, and in any gauge the bulk integral of (7)
vanishes1. A fortiori, the variation of ICS with respect to (ω, φa) is trivial. Pure Chern-
Simons dynamics here reduces entirely to the boundary2, rather than deﬁning the (trivially
B=0) behavior in the bulk.

Variation of the Maxwell action is also incomplete:

resulting in the pair of Euler-Lagrange equations

− δ 1

2 R B2 ≡ −R B · ǫcd(∇φc × ∇δφd) ,

(∇ × B) · ∇φa ≡ ∇ · (φa∇ × B) = 0 ,

a = 1, 2 .

(8)

(9)

1When the volume integral of A ·∇× A is nonzero, its entire contribution in the Clebsch parameterization
for A must come from surface terms. Consequently, the Clebsch potentials ω, φa must be ill behaved, either
in the ﬁnite volume or at inﬁnity, so that the surface integrals do not vanish. For an example and further
details, see [5]

2In this respect, when CS is used as the “helicity” in magnetohydrodynamics, it bears a resemblance to
gravitational energy; there is no sensible local (gauge invariant) density, but a perfectly well deﬁned integral
over the boundary.

That is, ∇ × B, like B itself, is orthogonal to the plane deﬁned by (∇φa): the ﬁeld equation
is then

∇ × B + µ(r)B = 0 .

(10)

The function of integration, µ(r), is constrained by the transversality of (B, ∇ × B) in (10)
to have its gradient orthogonal to them both: ∇µ must lie in the (∇φa) plane.
The indeterminacies in the two variational principles are rather diﬀerent:

from ICS,
there is no ﬁeld equation at all; this is in fact traceable to the Darboux incompleteness of
the Clebsch decomposition [6], which rests on the triviality of the bulk contribution to ICS
that it imposes1. From the Maxwell action, we obtain only the direction of ∇ × B. Indeed,
any gauge invariant action I[B] will provide the same form

[∇ × δI/δB(x)] · ∇φa = 0 ,

(11)

and hence allow the same indeterminate µ(r)B addition, subject to ∇µ · B = 0.

The topologically massive-like [7] “Maxwell” equation (10) is quite unusual: Consider (9)

in “covariant” notation,

whose solution is

(∂νF µν)∂µφa ≡ ∂µ(∂νF µνφa) = 0

∂νF µνφa = ǫναβ∂αZ a
β

(12)

(13)

where Z a
α are two arbitrary transverse 3-vectors. This means in turn that there are two
(conserved) “currents”, for example, jµ = (φbφb)−1φaǫµαβ∂αZ a
β. Equations (9,10) and (12,13)
present the ﬁeld equations in two equivalent ways. If we instead introduce the explicit form
(6) into (9), we get two (cubic) equations in φ alone,

∂ν[ǫbcφb(∂2
µν

− δµν ∇2)φc]∂µφa = 0 .

(14)

A nonabelian generalization of the Clebsch decomposition has recently been suggested
[9].
It shares the abelian property that the CS term is a pure divergence and a similar
degeneracy in the ﬁeld equations occurs. The basic mechanism in both cases is that the
variation of an action with respect to the initial variable, here Aµ or its color generalization,
is to be multiplied by δAµ/δω, δAµ/δφa. The degenerate contributions noted above again
occur as a result of the φa variations.

It is amusing to compare the Clebsch vector decomposition to the “string-embedding”

partition of a 2-tensor [8], available in any dimension d,

gµν(x) = yA

µ (x)yB

ν (x)ηAB ,

yA
µ

≡ ∂µyA .

(15)

The scalar string variables yA, with the index A ranging over 1, . . . , 1
2d(d + 1), are now the
independent ones. Inserting this decomposition into the Einstein action (or indeed any other
covariant one) and varying the yA,

δI = Z Gµνδgµν/δyAδyA ≡ −Z DµDν(GµνyA)δyA

(16a)

3

(where Gµν ≡ δI/δgµν is the necessarily identically conserved “Einstein” tensor density of
the action I[g]) gives Euler-Lagrange equations very similar to the “weak Maxwell” ones, in
terms of the covariant derivative Dµ(g)

Gµν(g(y))DµDνyA = 0 .

(16b)

These are much weaker [8] than3 Gµν = 0. In both vector and tensor cases, the problem is
with the derivative nature of a parameterization by scalars: the equally nonlinear vielbein
decomposition of the metric gµν = ea
νηab into the set of vectors (eµ)a is of course perfectly
acceptable (if the vielbeins are invertible). Also true of both the Clebsch and the tensor
decompositions is the inaccessibility of weak ﬁeld, linearized, theory from these nonlinear
parameterizations, unlike the (invertible) vielbein choice, where there is a vacuum possibility

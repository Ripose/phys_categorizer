We report the ﬁrst extensive experimental observation of
the two-dimensional enstrophy cascade, along with the de-
termination of the high order vorticity statistics. The en-
ergy spectra we obtain are remarkably close to the Kraichnan
Batchelor expectation. The distributions of the vorticity in-
crements, in the inertial range, deviate only little from gaus-
sianity and the corresponding structure functions exponents
are indistinguishable from zero. It is thus shown that there is
no sizeable small scale intermittency in the enstrophy cascade,
in agreement with recent theoretical analyses.

The enstrophy cascade is one of the most important
processes in two-dimensional turbulence, and its inves-
tigation, at fundamental level, provides cornerstones for
the analysis of atmosphere dynamics. The existence of
this cascade was ﬁrst conjectured by Kraichnan [1], and
later by Batchelor [2]. Both of them proposed that in
two-dimensional turbulence, enstrophy injected at a pre-
scribed scale is dissipated at smaller scales, undergoing
a cascading process at constant enstrophy transfer rate
η ; this led to predicting a k−3 spectrum for the en-
ergy, in a range of scales extending from the injection
to the dissipative scale. Later, logarithmic corrections
have been incorporated in the analysis to ensure con-
stancy of the enstrophy transfer rate [3]. The advent
of large computers revealed surprising deviations from
the classical expectation, especially in decaying systems
[9,8,10,7]. It was soon realized that in two-dimensional
systems, long live coherent structures inhibit the cascade
locally and therefore the self similarity of the process,
assumed to fully apply in the classical approach, is bro-
ken. Expressions like ”laminar drops in a turbulent back-
ground” were coined to illustrate the role of coherent
structures in the problem [9]. Along with the observa-
tions of unexpected exponents, models, emphasizing on
the role of particular vortical structures [12,11], or based
on conformal theory [13], suggested non classical values.
In the recent period however, high resolution simulations
[4,21,6,19] underlined that, provided long live coherent
structures are disrupted, classical behaviour holds ; fur-
thermore, theoretical studies [14,15] suggested the ab-
sence of small scale intermittency, placing the direct en-
strophy cascade in a position strikingly diﬀerent from
the three-dimensional energy cascade. The recent soap
ﬁlm experiments, developing single point measurements

of the velocity ﬁeld [16,18,17,20], obtained spectral expo-
nents consistent with these views.

Nonetheless, investigating small scale intermittency in
this problem requires measuring the statistics of quan-
tities such as the vorticity increments, which has not
been done yet, neither in physical nor in numerical ex-
periments. Eﬀorts in this direction were made in the
numerical study of Borue [21], but diﬃculties arose to
obtain converged results. An analysis of the enstrophy
ﬂuxes in the numerical experiment of Babiano et al [5]
led the authors to underlining the presence of weak inter-
mittency in the enstrophy cascade ; thus, although the
theory on the problem is at a well advanced stage (at
least compared to three-dimensional situation), it is not
yet known, even in situations where self similarity fully
holds, to what extent classical theory, based on mean
ﬁeld arguments ”a la Kolmogorov”, can be applied to
describe the enstrophy cascade. In the physical experi-
ment we present here, we have extensively measured the
statistics of vorticity increments, in a situation where co-
herent structures have been disrupted. We could show,
for the ﬁrst time, that in the enstrophy cascade, the de-
viation from gausiannity, for the small scale statistics of
the vorticity ﬁeld, are moderate, and -more importantly-
scale independant ; the corresponding structure function
exponents are indistinguishable from zero, so that inter-
mittency is absent from the process, in agreement with
the theoretical analysis of [15]. This observation, made
on a physical system perhaps brings the problem, more
ﬁrmly, within the reach of a theoretical understanding, a
situation rare in the ﬁeld.

The experimental set-up has been described in a series
of papers [25,23,24]. It appears that the system we use
is a formidable tool for investigating fundamental issues
of two-dimensional turbulence. It provides reliable data
on quantities reputed hard to measure. We believe this
is an interesting situation, since it would be unpleasant
to elaborate a rationale for 2D turbulence, solely on vir-
tual inputs . Brieﬂy speaking, the ﬂow is generated in a
square PVC cell, 15 cm × 15 cm. The bottom of the cell
is made of a thin (1 mm thick) glass plate, below which
permanent magnets, 5x8x4 mm in size, and delivering a
magnetic ﬁeld, of maximum strength 0.3 T, are placed.
In order to ensure two-dimensionality [22], the cell is ﬁlled
with two layers of NaCl solutions, 2.5 mm thick, with dif-
ferent densities, placed in a stable conﬁguration, i.e. the
heavier underlying the lighter. Under typical operating
conditions, the stratiﬁcation remains unaltered for pe-

1

riods of times extending up to 10mn. The interaction
of an electrical current driven across the cell with the
magnetic ﬁeld produces local stirring forces. The ﬂow
is visualized by using clusters of 2 µm in size latex par-
ticles, placed at the free surface, and the velocity ﬁelds
v(x, t) are determined using particle image velocimetry
technique, implemented on 64 × 64 grids. In such exper-
iments, the dissipative scale for the enstrophy cascade -
deﬁned by ld = η1/6ν1/2 (where ν is the kinematic vis-
cosity of the working ﬂuid) - is on the order of 1 mm ;
it is thus unresolved. Moreover, ld lying below the layer
thickness, it is reasonable to consider that the way how
enstrophy is dissipated in our system is not purely two-
dimensional. Concerning now measurement accuracy, we
estimate, from the measurement of local divergence, that
the accuracy on the velocity is a few percent and that on
the vorticity is 10%.

In the experiments we describe here, magnets are ar-
ranged into four triangular aggregates of roughly one
hundred units, having the same magnetic orientation, as
shown schematically in Fig 1. By doing so, the electro-
magnetic forcing is deﬁned on large scale, and its spatial
structure does not favour any particular permanent pat-
tern.

The electrical current is unsteady : it is a non periodic,
zero mean, square waveform, of amplitude equal to 0.75
A (see Fig 1). The corresponding Reynolds number -
deﬁned as the square of the ratio of the forcing to the
dissipative scale - is on the order of 103 ; this estimate
is one order of magnitude above the largest simulation
performed on the subject, using normal viscosity (See
[21]). In the statistically steady state, the instantaneous
ﬂow pattern consists of transient recirculations of sizes
comparable to one fourth of the box size. The formation
of permanent large scale structures, which might tend to
break the self similarity of the process, seems disrupted
by our particular forcing.

The instantaneous vorticity ﬁeld in the statistically
stationary state is shown in Fig 2. We see elongated
structures, in form of ﬁlaments or ribbons, some of them
extending across a large fraction of the cell. At vari-
ance with the decaying regimes, and consistently with
the above discussion, we have not seen any long live vor-
ticity concentration, i.e persisting more than a few sec-
onds. This is further conﬁrmed by a measurement of the
ﬂatness of the vorticity distribution, a diagnostics previ-
ously introduced by [6] and which is found slightly above
the gaussian value in our case. The presence of coherent
structures would have been associated to much larger val-
ues of this quantity. The isotropy of the vorticity ﬁeld
is not obvious from the inspection of a single realisation,
such as the one of Fig 2 ; nonetheless, as will be shown
later, the overall anisotropy level, obtained after statisti-
cal averaging, turns out to be reasonably small.

The spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld, averaged over 200
realisations, in the statistically steady state, is shown in

Fig 3. The forcing wave number kf ∼ 0.6 cm−1 cor-
responds to the location of the maximum of the energy
spectrum ; it is associated to an injection scale lf = 2π
kf
estimated to 10 cm, a value consistent with the size of
our permanent magnets clusters. The wave-number as-
sociated to the stratiﬁed ﬂuid layer, may be deﬁned as
kl = 2π
∼ 12 cm−1 (where b is the ﬂuid thickness). This
wave-number, together with the sampling wave-number,
which is 25 cm−1, are well outside the region of inter-
est. Fig 3 shows that in the high wave number region, i.e
above 9 cm−1, the spectrum is ﬂat. This region is domi-
nated by white noise ; it reﬂects a limitation in the PIV
technique to resolve low velocity levels at small scales.

b

The interesting feature is that there exists a spectral
lying between kf and kmax ∼7 cm−1 , uncon-
band,
taminated by a possible interaction with the layer wave-
number, in which a power law behaviour is observed. The
corresponding exponent is close to -3, as shown on the
compensated spectrum. A direct measurement of the ex-
ponent, performed by using least square ﬁt in the scaling
region, leads to proposing the following formula for the
spectrum :

E(k) ∼ k−3.0±0.2

The exponent we ﬁnd is thus close to classical expec-
tation. There is no steepening eﬀect of the spectrum,
which could be attributed, as in decaying systems, to the
presence of coherent structures. Further analysis of the
vorticity ﬁeld shows homogeneity and stationary, of the
process. Isotropy is also obtained, albeit only roughly, as
shown in Fig 4 : to estimate the anisotropy level, we fol-
low circles, embedded in the inertial range, in the spectral
plane of Fig 4, and determine by how much the spectral
energy departs from a constant value along such circles.
This leads to an anisotropy level on the order of 15 % in
the central region of the inertial range ; this is acceptably
low. Determining the Kraichnan Batchelor constant is a
delicate issue, which entirely relies on the measurement
of the enstrophy pumping rate η. The constant we dis-
cuss here, called C’, is deﬁned by expressing the energy
spectrum in the form :

E(k) = C′η2/3k−3

To measure C’, we determine the spectral enstropy
transfer rate from below k to above k, - Λ(k) - and
search for a plateau, within the scaling range of the en-
ergy spectrum. Λ(k) is found positive throughout this
range, which conﬁrms the cascade is forward. To deter-
mine η, we further average out Λ(k), between kf and
kmax. This procedure provides the following estimate for
the Kraichnan Batchelor constant C’ :

C′ ≈ 1.4 ± 0.3

This estimate agrees with that found in the high res-
olution study of Ref [21], for which values ranging be-
tween 1.5 and 1.7 have been proposed. We provide here

emphasized on, is indeed important and interesting, but
should probably be considered as a separate issue.

We now turn to the intermittency problem. Fig 5
shows a set of ﬁve distributions of the vorticity incre-
ments, obtained for diﬀerent inertial scales, ranging be-
tween 2 and 9 cm. As usual, in order to analyze shapes,
the pdfs have been renormalized to impose their variance
be equal to unity. The shapes of the pdfs are not ex-
actly the same, but there is no systematic trend with the
scale across which the vorticity increment is determined.
Within experimental error, the distributions roughly col-
lapse onto a single curve ; the tails of such an average
distribution are broader than a gaussian curve, but here
again, the deviations have a moderate amplitude and are
scale independant. It is thus diﬃcult here, from the in-
spection of the distributions, to ﬁgure out the presence
of intermittency in the enstrophy cascade.

The analysis of the structure functions of the vorticity,
shown on Fig 6, conﬁrms this statement. These structure
functions are deﬁned by :

Sp(r) =< (ω(x + r) − ω(x))p >
in which x and r are vectors, and r is the modulus of
r. The brackets mean double averaging, both in space,
throughout the plane domain, and in time, between 20
and 280 s. We use here 105 data points to determine
the structure functions ; this allows to determine up to
twelfth order, because of the near gaussianity of the pdfs.
Fig 6 thus represents a series of vorticity structure func-
tions Sp(r), obtained in such conditions, emphasizing on
the inertial domain, i.e with r varying between 1 and 10
cm. The structure functions are essentially ﬂat, indicat-
ing the structure function exponents are close to zero.
The corresponding values of such exponents fall in the
range -0.05, 0.15, for p varying between 2 and 10 ; this is
indistinguishable from zero. We thus obtain here a result
fully compatible with the classical theory, for which the
exponents are predicted to be exactly zero at all orders.
Surprisingly, we do not detect any logarithmic deviation,
which would be compatible with the analysis of Refs [15].
It is however not completely safe that this does not reﬂect
a limitation in the measurements.

To summarize, we have performed, for the ﬁrst time
in a physical system, an extensive observation of the en-
strophy cascade. Previous experiments inferred its exis-
tence from the interpretation of k−3 spectra. We provide
here a complete observation, along with a measurement
of the Kraichnan Batchelor constant, and a determina-
tion of the high order vorticity statistics, a crucial quan-
tity to measure for addressing the intermittency problem.
We obtain that classical theory is strikingly successful ;
there is no sizeable small scale intermittency, and the
vorticity statistics departs only weakly from gausiannity,
at all scales. Because of these particular features, one
may perhaps hope this problem be brought to theoreti-
cal understanding. The role of coherent structures, long

We consider an axisymmetric, freely suspended ﬂuid drop with surface tension, whose
viscosity is so large that both inertia and forcing by an external ﬂuid can be ignored. We
show that whatever be the initial condition, pinchoﬀ can never occur.

The breakup of ﬂuid drops has been studied very extensively (Stone (1994), Eggers
(1997), Basaran (2002)) owing to its relevance to mixing, printing, and DNA analysis.
In most circumstances, breakup of an extended drop occurs almost inevitably owing to
the Rayleigh instability (Eggers (1997)), which tends to locally reduce the radius until
breakup occurs. So one might think that a suﬃciently extended drop, that has separated
from a nozzle or has been stretched by an external ﬂuid of comparatively low viscosity,
will break up in the same manner. Here we show that this is not the case, but that
the drop always retracts to its spherical state of minimum surface energy, if inertial and
external forces can be neglected, see ﬁgure 1. Stone (1994), p.81, makes some prescient
remarks which amount to the same statement, but we are not aware that the impossibility
of breakup has ever been shown.

The interior of the drop is thus described by Stokes’ equation, subject to a normal stress
z)3/2
γκn, where γ is the coeﬃcient of surface tension and κ = 1/h(1 + h2
twice the mean curvature of the interface. If σ is the stress tensor, this can be summarised
concisely by

z)1/2 − hzz/(1 + h2

∇ · σ = 0

in the drop,

σn = −γnκ on the surface.

(0.1)

Integrating ∇ · σ over a volume V bounded by the drop surface and a plane perpendicular
to the axis (cf. ﬁgure 1), we ﬁnd from the divergence theorem and from the boundary
condition that

where O is the surface as shown in ﬁgure 1, and Cr(z) is the cross section of the drop at

Figure 1. A viscous drop of unperturbed radius R is initially extended to a length of
15.5 R. The full lines show it retracting back into a sphere following Stokes’ equation, at
t = n × 0.646 ηR/γ, n = 0, 1, 2, 3. The dashed lines are proﬁles computed on the basis of
the lubrication equation (0.6), shown at the same times. Note that the minimum local drop
radius is always a monotonically increasing function.

for the total force on the cross section of the drop.

Using the deﬁnition of the stress tensor (Landau & Lifshitz 1982), the ez-component

of (0.4) can be rewritten as

h(z)

p(r, z)rdr + 2ηvr(h(z), z) = γh/(1 + h2

z)1/2,

(0.5)

where p(r, z) is the pressure, η the viscosity of the liquid, and vr(r, z) the radial component
of the velocity.

We want to show that vr(h(z), z) is always positive at local minima hmin of h(z), which
would mean that the minimum radius can only increase, so breakup can never occur. We
are not able to compute the integral over the pressure in the most general case, so we
concentrate on the case that hmin is small, as it must be if breakup were to occur. In
that case the radial dependence of the pressure is well described by a constant, which is
(Eggers (1997)) p(r, z) ≈ γκ + 2ηvr(h, z)/h. Using this expression for the pressure, (0.5)
turns into

vr(h(z), z) = (γ/6η)

1/(1 + h2

z)3/2

.

(0.6)

At a local minimum of h hzz is positive, making vr positive, so hmin is increasing in time
and breakup is impossible.

We have been careful to invoke (0.6) only in the region around hmin, where it is sure
to hold. In fact, (0.6) is equivalent to the one-dimensional lubrication-type description,
which was found to often work surprisingly well throughout a ﬂuid drop or ﬁlament
(Eggers (1997), Basaran (2002)). Here, we ﬁnd this observation conﬁrmed, as illustrated
in ﬁgure 1 by superimposing the lubrication calculation (dashed lines) onto the full
numerical calculation. No adjustable parameter was introduced in the comparison. It
follows from (0.6) and is illustrated by ﬁgure 1, that the minimum radius as given by the
lubrication approximation must be monotonically increasing. We suspect that the same
holds true for the full Stokes equations, but at present we can’t exclude a decreasing hmin
in cases where hmin is not small. It would be interesting to extend our results to the case
that an exterior ﬂuid is present. Results presented by Powers et al. (1998) suggest that
breakup does not occur as long as the exterior viscosity is suﬃciently small.

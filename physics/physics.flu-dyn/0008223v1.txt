New complex variables for equations

of ideal barotropic ﬂuid

Abstract

We propose new construction of dependent variables for equations
of an ideal barotropic ﬂuid. This construction is based on a direct gen-
eralization of the known connection between Schroedinger equation
and a system of Euler-type equations. The system for two complex-
valued functions is derived that is equivalent to Euler equations. Pos-
sible advantages of the proposed formulation are discussed.

1 Introduction

When solving a partial problem of ﬂuid dynamics or exploring general prop-
erties of governing equations one often use diﬀerent choice of the dependent
variables.
Introduction of a stream function is common practice for two-
dimensional problems. For a general case of a 3D time-dependent ﬂow one
can use a vector potential, a pair of stream functions (for incompressible
case), Clebsch potentials and etc. Clebsch potentials are mainly used with
intention to exploit preferences of Lagrange description of a ﬂuid motion.
The new representation is based on the use of multi-valued potentials and
Euler approach. The paper is composed as follows. In the second section
we analyze Madelung transformation that connects a generic Schroedinger
equation with a system of Euler-type equations. Some generalization will be
made for the case of potential ﬂows of a barotropic ﬂuid. In the next sec-
tion the generalization of Madelung transformation for a general vector ﬁeld

1

will be derived, that leads to the system of equations (8) for two complex-
valued functions with arbitrary potentials. In the fourth section we use this
arbitrariness and propose the choice of potentials, that make the system
equivalent to Euler equations for an ideal barotropic ﬂuid. To substantiate
this we will derive Euler equations from the system (8). In the last section we
discuss possible preferences of new choice of dependent variables and their
relation to vortices.

2 Madelung transformation

Since pioneer work by E.Madelung [1] physical literature contains many ex-
amples of connection between Schroedinger equation of quantum mechanics
and ﬂuid dynamics. Typical exposition of this connection is the substitution
ψ = √ρei ϕ

β into

that leads to

This trick looks slightly mystical for novice. Some historical notes and elu-
cidation can be found in [3]. More clear is back substitution. Following
Madelung [2], let’s linearize equation (2) using substitution

ρ = ψψ, ϕ = −

were β has dimension of kinematical viscosity. After simple algebra one can
obtain

Choice

leads to Schroedinger equation. Here V is a real-valued function of a time,
coordinates and/or ψ. We can conclude that this equation leads to conser-
vation of probability, but dynamics is completely deﬁned by potential V .

Now from hydrodynamical viewpoint let’s summarize restrictions that
were implicitly used in this derivation. First, interpreting ρ as density of some
ﬂuid with an arbitrary equation of state, we see that ﬂuid ﬂow is supposed
to be potential. Second, we use dimensional constant β.

To describe an ideal ﬂuid, we can to overcome the second restriction using

a non-dimensional form of equation (2) (β = 1) and the potential

V = Π (ρ) +

that diﬀers from Schroedinger equation. This form of equation of an ideal
barotropic ﬂuid seems to be unknown.

3 Generalization of Madelung transformation

We consider a direct generalization of the previous scheme for the case of
two complex-valued functions and introduce deﬁnitions

ρ = ρ1 + ρ2, J = ρV = ρ1∇ϕ1 + ρ2∇ϕ2

(5)

Obviously, permutation of indexes should not have any physical consequence.
For velocity and vorticity we obtain

V =

ρ1

ρ2
ρ ∇ϕ2, ∇ × V =

ρ1ρ2

ρ2 ∇ ln  ρ1

ρ2! × ∇ (ϕ1 − ϕ2)

total helicity

ρ2! (∇ϕ1 × ∇ϕ2) · dσ 6= 0

implies a multi-valuedness of potentials [4] (here integral should be taken over
some closed surface). That is admissible due to usage of the complex-valued
variables.

4 New form of Euler equations

To apply the derived system to description of an ideal barotropic ﬂow we
need a proper choice of the potentials I, V1, V2. By inspection it was found
that

make system equivalent to Euler equations. Here w = ∇ (ϕ1 − ϕ2). The
invariance of systems (8),(9) with respect to both Galilei group and indexes
permutation can be directly checked.

Substitution of (10-12) into (9) give

From equations (13) follows (7).
Now we start derivation of equation for ﬂux J. First, multiplying (14),(15)
by ρk respectively, summing and taking gradient of result, then adding to
obtained equation (13), multiplied by ∇ϕk respectively, one can obtain

can show that terms in square braces give Lamb vector

from (16) Euler equation in Gromeka-Lamb form

(17)

The result is as follows: System (8) is equivalent to system of Euler equation
(17).

5 Discussion

First of all, the attractive feature of (8) is the homogeneity both depen-
dent variables and equations in contrast to the non-homogeneity of veloc-
ity/density and form of equations in (18). This property can be used both
numerically and analytically. Homogeneity and elimination of the convective

6

derivative can substantially simplify numerical algorithm. As far as multi-
valuedness is concerned, the possibility of use multi-valued potentials was
clearly demonstrated in [5]. In analytical way the aforementioned property
can simplify proof of existence and uniqueness theorems. Also application
of geometrical methods to partial diﬀerential equations (8) is looking quite
natural.

This formulation of Euler equation can have another interesting property.
Zeroes of solution of nonlinear Schoedinger equation correspond to a vortex
axes (topological defects) [5]. At a moment the condition ψ = 0 deﬁnes two
surfaces, and their intersection deﬁnes a space curve (possibly, disconnected).
Note similarity with deﬁnition of a vortex as zero of an analitical complex-
valued function in two-dimensional hydrodynamic of ideal incompressible
ﬂuid.
If the system (8) inherits this property from its prototype (1) the
known problem of a vortex deﬁnition [6] can be solved in general case.

Asymmetric, helical and mirror-symmetric travelling waves in pipe ﬂow

(Dated: December 20, 2013)

New families of three-dimensional nonlinear travelling waves are discovered in pipe ﬂow. In con-
trast to known waves (Faisst & Eckhardt Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 224502 (2003), Wedin & Kerswell,
J. Fluid Mech. 508, 333 (2004)), they possess no rotational symmetry and exist at much lower
Reynolds numbers. Particularly striking is an ‘asymmetric mode’ which has one slow streak sand-
wiched between two fast streaks located preferentially to one side of the pipe. This family originates
in a pitchfork bifurcation from a mirror-symmetric travelling wave which can be traced down to
a Reynolds number of 773. Helical and non-helical rotating waves are also found emphasizing the
richness of phase space even at these very low Reynolds numbers. The delay in Reynolds number
from when the laminar state ceases to be a global attractor to turbulent transition is then even
larger than previously thought.

PACS numbers: 47.20.Ft,47.27.Cn,47.27.nf

Wall-bounded shear ﬂows are of tremendous practi-
cal importance yet their transition to turbulence is still
poorly understood. The oldest and most famous ex-
ample is the stability of ﬂow along a straight pipe of
circular cross-section ﬁrst studied over 120 years ago
[1]. A steady, unidirectional, laminar solution - Hagen-
Poiseuille ﬂow [2, 3] - always exists but is only realised
experimentally for lower ﬂow rates (measured by the
Reynolds number Re = U D/ν, where U is the mean ax-
ial ﬂow speed, D is the pipe diameter and ν is the ﬂuid’s
kinematic viscosity). At higher Re, the ﬂuid selects
a state which is immediately spatially and temporally
complex rather than adopting a sequence of intermedi-
ate states of gradually decreasing symmetry. The ex-
act transition Reynolds number Ret depends sensitively
on the shape and amplitude of the disturbance present
and therefore varies across experiments with quoted val-
ues typically ranging from 2300 down to a more recent
estimate of 1750 ([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]). A
new direction in rationalising this abrupt transition re-
volves around identifying alternative solutions (beyond
the laminar state) to the governing Navier-Stokes equa-
tions. These have only recently be found in the form of
travelling waves (TWs) [13, 14] and all seem to be saddle
points in phase space. They appear though saddle node
bifurcations with the lowest found at Re = 1251. The
delay before transition occurs (Ret ≥ 1750) is attributed
to the need for phase space to become suﬃciently compli-
cated (through the entanglement of stable and unstable
manifolds of an increasing number of saddle points) to
support turbulent trajectories.

In this Letter, we present four new families of ‘asym-
metric’, ‘mirror-symmetric’, helical and non-helical ro-
tating TWs which have diﬀerent structure to known so-
lutions and exist at lower Reynolds numbers. The asym-
metric family, which have one slow streak sandwiched
between two fast streaks located preferentially to one
side of the pipe, are particularly signiﬁcant as they are

the missing family of rotationally-asymmetric waves not
found in [13, 14] and have the structure preferred by the
linear transient growth mechanism [15]. They bifurcate
from a new mirror-symmetric family which can be traced
down to a saddle node bifurcation at Re = 773. This
ﬁgure substantially lowers the current best estimate of
1251 for Reg - the Reynolds number at which the lam-
inar state stops being a global attractor. The relative
sizes of this new Reg and Ret for pipe ﬂow are then
more in line with plane Couette ﬂow (Ret = 323 [16] and
Reg = 127.7 [17, 18]: Re based on half the velocity dif-
ference and half the channel width) than plane Poiseuille
ﬂow (Ret ≈ 1300 [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and Reg = 860 [18]:
Re based on the mean ﬂow rate and the channel width).
Beyond suggesting that Reg in plane Poiseuille ﬂow can
be signiﬁcantly lowered, these latest discoveries highlight
the substantial delay in Re between new solutions ap-
pearing in phase space and the emergence of sustained
turbulent trajectories.

The new solutions were captured by inserting a fully
3-dimensional spectral representation (Chebychev in s,
Fourier in φ and z where (s, φ, z) are the usual cylindri-
cal coordinates aligned with the pipe) of the velocity and
pressure ﬁeld into the governing Navier-Stokes equations
as viewed from an appropriately rotating and translating
reference frame in which the TW is steady [14]. The re-
sultant nonlinear algebraic system was solved using the
Newton-Raphson algorithm [30]. To start the procedure
oﬀ, an artiﬁcial body force was added to the Navier-
Stokes equations (see [14]) designed to give streamwise-
independent vortices and streaks of a ﬁnite amplitude.
The size of the forcing was then adjusted to ﬁnd a bi-
furcation point at which the translational ﬂow symmetry
along the pipe is broken. New ﬁnite-amplitude solutions
to pipe ﬂow were found if this solution branch could be
continued back to the zero-forcing limit.

The TWs previously isolated [13, 14] were induced us-

where α is the base axial wavenumber (so the periodic
pipe is 2π/α long) and take the form u(s, φ, z, t) =
u(s, φ, z − Ct) where C is the a priori unknown axial
phase speed of the wave. In contrast, new rotationally-
asymmetric TWs were found by using a forcing function
which created vortices with the radial velocity structure
u(s, φ) ∝ ℜe{ e−1/s(1 − s2) P
7 ) ]eimφ }
and hence distributed energy across a band of azimuthal
wavenumbers. This choice led to a branch of asymmetric
solutions whose component fast and slow streaks are pref-
erentially located to one side of the pipe (see Figs 1 and
2). These asymmetric TWs are S-symmetric and have
one phase speed C along the pipe. They extend beyond
Re = 5000 and originate at a pitchfork bifurcation (at
Re = 1770 when α = 0.75) from a mirror-symmetric TW
family (see Figs 1 and 2) which satisﬁes the additional
shift-&-rotate symmetry

Ø : (u, v, w, p)(s, φ, z) → (u, v, w, p)(s, φ + π, z + π/α)

(coupled with the S-symmetry, this implies invariance
under reﬂection in the line φ = ±π/2). The mirror-
symmetric solutions undergo a saddle node bifurcation
at much lower Re: Re = 1167 at α = 0.75 going down
to a minimum of Re = 773 at α = 1.44: see Fig. 3.
The friction factors associated with the upper branches
of these new modes are much larger than the rotationally-
symmetric modes [13, 14] (see Fig. 4).

Both new families possess the characteristic features
of the TWs found in [13, 14]: essentially 2-dimensional
fast streaks near the wall and aligned with the ﬂow, slow
streaks in the interior which are aligned on average with

symmetry, all the TWs also possess the shift-&-reﬂect

the ﬂow, and a smaller (typically by an order of mag-
nitude) 3-dimensional wave ﬁeld. By continuity, helical
TWs should exist with these fast streaks inclined to the
ﬂow direction and indeed a surface of such solutions can
be found connecting the upper and lower branches of the
mirror-symmetric TWs (see Fig. 5). These helical TWs
take the form u(s, φ, z, t) = u(s, φ−β[z −Ct]−ωt, z −Ct)
with β measuring the helicity in the Galilean frame mov-
ing at Cˆz and ω being an azimuthal phase speed relative
to the Galilean frame. Helicity destroys S-symmetry but
a modiﬁed form of Ø-symmetry (Øβ) is preserved where
the rotation transformation is now φ → φ + (1 − β
α )π.
The helicity β and rotational speed ω never rise above
O(10−2) for Re ≤ 1500 conﬁrming the ﬂow preference
for non-rotating, axially-aligned streaks.
Interestingly,
in the range Re = 1165 − 1330, the helicity β on this sur-
face passes through zero twice in going between the two
mirror-symmetric branches (see Fig. 5). These points
correspond to an isola in the (ﬁxed α) C vs Re plane
of rotating non-helical modes which are neither shift-&-
reﬂect symmetric nor have any rotational symmetry. The
helical and non-helical rotating waves look very similar to
the mirror-symmetric modes except for a slight twist in

wave branches ﬁt together in (β, Re, C) space (at α = 0.75).
The main parabolic curve in the β = 0 plane is the mirror-
symmetric branch oﬀ which the asymmetric branch bifur-
cates (uppermost line). Helical branches bulge out of the
β = 0 plane and connect upper and lower parts of the mirror-
symmetric. Across a ﬁnite range of Re, these helical modes
perforate the β = 0 plane in between the mirror-symmetric
branches creating an isola of non-helical rotating TWs (closed
dash-dot loop). Helical waves also connect the asymmet-
ric branch and the helical solutions which originate from the
mirror-symmetric solutions.

lical modes continued oﬀ the asymmetric modes have no
symmetry at all and originate in a symmetry-breaking bi-
furcation oﬀ the Øβ-symmetric helical solutions extended
from the mirror-symmetric waves: see Fig. 5.

The asymmetric, mirror-symmetric and helical TWs
all represent saddle points in phase space with a very
low-dimensional unstable manifolds (e.g. 2 for the asym-
metric mode at (α, Re) = (0.75, 1820) and 4 for the
mirror-symmetric mode at (α, Re) = (0.75, 1184)). Their
presence indicates the richness of phase space even at

Reynolds numbers approaching 773. The delay of transi-
tion until Re ≥ 1750 suggests that the establishment of a
‘turbulence-bearing’ scaﬀold constituted of all their sta-
ble and unstable manifolds is far from immediate. The
clear implication is that while the emergence of alter-
native solutions to the laminar state seems a necessary
precursor for transition, it is not a good predictor of the
actual Reynolds number at which this occurs in pipe ﬂow
(and other shear ﬂow systems). Once the transitional
regime has been reached however, there is now mounting
experimental [24, 25] and numerical evidence [26, 27] in-
dicating that some of the travelling waves at least (those
with low to intermediate wall shear stresses [26]) appear
as transient but recurrent coherent structures within the
ﬂow. Intriguingly, numerical simulations [26] have also
revealed that a number of travelling waves with low wall
shear stress sit on a dividing surface in phase space (a
separatrix if the turbulence is a sustained state) which
separates initial conditions which directly relaminarise
and those which lead to a turbulent episode. Recent com-
putations [28, 29] using a shooting technique to converge
onto this dividing surface appear to have already found
that the asymmetric wave sits there too (compare Fig
1 to Fig. 8 of [29] and Fig. 1 of [28]). The fact that
this wave bears some resemblence to m = 1 ‘optimal’
disturbances which emerge from linear transient growth
analyses also suggests an enticing opportunity to bridge
the gap between linear and nonlinear approaches.

In summary, we have presented a series of new travel-
ling wave solutions to the pipe ﬂow problem which have
diﬀerent structure to existing solutions and which exist
at far lower Reynolds numbers. One type - the asymmet-
ric modes - represents the missing m = 1 family from the
waves found initially [13, 14]. These waves also appear to
rationalise some interesting results from recent numerical
computations [28, 29], thereby corroborating the picture
which is emerging that lower branch TWs (and therefore
also their stable manifolds) sit on the separatrix between
laminar and turbulent states.

Flat Plate Boundary Conditions

Abstract

A irrotational solution is derived for the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations that approximately satisﬁes the boundary conditions for ﬂow
over a ﬁnite ﬂat plate. The nature of the ﬂow diﬀers substantially from
boundary layer ﬂow, with severe numerical diﬃculties in some regions.

An analytic function having the form

f (z) = v + iu,

leads to an exact solution of the two-dimensional steady-state Navier-Stokes

equations, i.e.,

u · ∇u = −∇p + µ∇2u;

ρ0

∇ · u = 0.

This occurs because (1) leads to a velocity ﬁeld having the properties

and

∇2u = 0;

∇ · u = 0;
∇ × u = 0.

This is a subset of the generalized Beltrami ﬂows1, and note that (4) are
the Cauchy-Riemann equations for (1). Substituting (3) and (4) into (2), and
using the identity

u · ∇ u = (∇ × u) × u +

The main diﬃculty with (1) involves ﬁnding a function f (z) satisfying useful

no-slip boundary conditions. Consider the function

sin (2π (z − z0) /L) idx0

.

Here z = x + iy, z0 = x0 + iy0 and y0 = 0. When y → ∞,

f (z) →

= 0.

Making use of the identity

sin (2π (z − z0) /L) = cos (2πx0/L) sin (2πz/L)

(10)

− sin (2πx0/L) cos (2πz/L) ,

the terms cos (2πz/L) and sin (2πz/L) become large as y → ∞; however,
sin (2πx0/L) and cos (2πx0/L) are precisely zero when integrated over 0 ≤ x0 ≤
L.

When y = 0,

f (z) = lim
ǫ→0

sin (2π (x − x0) /L) idx0
A + [B sin (2π (x − x0) /L) − A] e(x−x0)2/ǫ

.

(11)

When x 6= x0, the denominator in (11) diverges. However, as x → x0, the
denominator approaches B sin (2π (x − x0) /L), so that as ǫ → 0, u approaches
a rectangle function between x = 0 and x = L and v approaches zero, meeting
the boundary conditions for ﬂow over a ﬂat plate.

Although the integral (8) can be diﬃcult to evaluate in some regions, soft-
ware packages seem to have less trouble converging when B >> A, at least for
y = 0. Choosing ǫ = 0.0001, A = 5.6 × 10−4, B = 100A and L = 1 m satisﬁes
the ﬂat plate boundary condition as shown in ﬁgure 1. As ǫ → 0, u becomes
more step-like at x = 0 and x = 1. Numerical approaches require ǫ to be ﬁnite,
leading to regions at the plate edges where the boundary conditions are not
satisﬁed. These regions can be made as small as required by reducing ǫ.

The boundary layer assumptions, i.e., ∂

∂y = 0 are useful for
analyzing ﬂow over a ﬂat plate, but they break down in the region at the leading
edge2, when U0x/ν . 10000. This region of non-validity can be used to deﬁne
an acceptable region where the ﬂat plate boundary conditions are only satisﬁed

approximately by (11) and thus determines a practical value for ǫ. When
U0 = 1 m / s and ν = 10−6 m2 / s, the extent of non-validity is approximately
deﬁned by x . 0.01 m. Setting ǫ = 0.00001, A = 5.9 × 10−5, and B = 100A
leads to the boundary conditions being satisﬁed to within a tolerance on the
order of 10−6 at the edges of the regions −0.01 ≤ x ≤ 0.01 and 0.99 ≤ x ≤ 1.01
as shown in ﬁgure 2.

Although the ﬂow described by (8) exactly satisﬁes the boundary conditions
for a ﬁnite ﬂat plate when ǫ → 0 (and approximately for small but ﬁnite ǫ), the
ﬂow ﬁeld diﬀers substantially from boundary layer ﬂow. Figure 3 shows the re-
gions having nonzero velocity components. As y increases, the integrand evolves
into a sinusoidal-like function, until it becomes suﬃciently sinusoidal that u and
v both approach zero. Just below the upper ”zero” line, small perturbations
in the sinusoidal-like integrand functions lead to nonzero velocities.
In some
regions, either the ﬁrst term or the second in the denominator in (8) dominate,
allowing the other to be neglected. The latter is true when y << 1 above the
plate, allowing the velocity ﬁeld to be accurately approximated. When nei-
ther terms can be neglected, evaluation of the integral becomes tedious because
of very large integrand magnitudes, leading software packages to either fail to
converge or converge to incorrect solutions. Numerical determination of the
velocity ﬁeld for many regions remains a challenge.

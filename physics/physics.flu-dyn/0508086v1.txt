Abstract

We construct the Navier-Stokes equation from ﬁrst principle using relativistic
bosonic lagrangian which is invariant under local gauge transformations. We show
that by deﬁning the bosonic ﬁeld to represent the dynamic of ﬂuid in a particular
form, a general Navier-Stokes equation with conservative forces can be reproduced
exactly. It also induces two new forces, one is relevant for rotational ﬂuid, and the
other is due to the ﬂuid’s current or density. This approach provides an underlying
theory to apply the tools in ﬁeld theory to the problems in ﬂuid dynamics.

1 Introduction

The Navier-Stokes (NS) equation represents a non-linier system with ﬂow’s velocity ~v ≡
~v(xµ), where xµ is a 4-dimensional space consists of time and spatial spaces, xµ ≡
(x0, xi) = (t, ~r) = (t, x, y, z). Note that throughout the paper we use natural unit, i.e.
the light velocity c = 1 such that ct = t and then time and spatial spaces have a same di-
mension. Also we use the relativistic (Minkowski) space, with the metric gµν = (1, −~1) =
(1, −1, −1, −1) that leads to x2 = xµxµ = xµgµνxν = x2

0 − x2 = x2

Since the NS equation is derived from the second Newton’s law, in principle it should be
derived from analytical mechanics using the principle of at-least action on the hamiltonian
as already done in several papers [1]. Some papers also relate it with the Maxwell equation
[2]. The relation between NS and Maxwell equations is, however, not clear and intuitively
understandable claim since both equations represent diﬀerent systems. Moreover, some
authors have also formulated the ﬂuid dynamics in lagrangian with gauge symmetries [3].
However, in those previous works the lagrangian has been constructed from continuity
equation.

Inspired by those pioneering works, we have tried to construct the NS equation from
ﬁrst principle of analytical mechanics, i.e. starting from lagrangian density. Also con-
cerning that the NS equation is a system with 4-dimensional space as mentioned above,
it is natural to borrow the methods in the relativistic ﬁeld theory which treats time and
space equally. Then we start with developing a lagrangian for bosonic ﬁeld and put a con-
traint such that it is gauge invariant. Taking the bosonic ﬁeld to have a particular form
representing the dynamics of ﬂuid, we derive the equation of motion which reproduces
the NS equation.

In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce the bosonic lagrangian and then review brieﬂy the
abelian and non-abelian gauge symmetries. After constructing the NS equation through
Euler-Lagrange equation, we give some conclusions.

2 Gauge invariant bosonic lagrangian

In the relativistic ﬁeld theory, the lagrangian (density) for a bosonic ﬁeld A is written as
[5],

LA = (∂µA)(∂µA) + m2

AA2 ,

(1)

where mA is a coupling constant with mass dimension, and ∂µ ≡ ∂/∂xµ. The bosonic
ﬁeld has the dimension of [A] = 1 in the unit of mass dimension [m] = 1 ([xµ] = −1). The
bosonic particles are, in particle physics, interpreted as the particles which are responsible
to mediate the forces between interacting fermions, ψ’s. Then, one has to ﬁrst start from
the fermionic lagrangian,

Lψ = i ¯ψγµ(∂µψ) − mψ ¯ψψ ,
(2)
where ψ and ¯ψ are the fermion and anti-fermion ﬁelds with the dimension [ψ] = [ ¯ψ] = 3/2
(then [mψ] = 1 as above), while γµ is the Dirac gamma matrices. In order to expand the
theory and incorporate some particular interactions, one should impose some symmetries.

2

2.1 Abelian gauge theory

For simplicity, one might introduce the simplest symmetry called U(1) (abelian) gauge
symmetry. The U(1) local transformation4 is just a phase transformation U ≡ exp [−iθ(x)]
U
−→ ψ′ ≡ U ψ. If one requires that the lagrangian in Eq. (2)
of the fermions, that is ψ
is invariant under this local transformation, i.e. L → L′ = L, a new term coming from
replacing the partial derivative with the covariant one ∂µ → Dµ ≡ ∂µ + ieAµ, should be
added as,

L = Lψ − e( ¯ψγµψ)Aµ .

Here the additional ﬁeld Aµ should be a vector boson since [Aµ] = 1 as shown in Eq. (1).
This ﬁeld is known as gauge boson and should be transformed under U(1) as,

Aµ

U
−→ A′

µ ≡ Aµ +

(∂µθ) ,

e

to keep the invariance of Eq. (3). Here e is a dimensionless coupling constant interpreted
as electric charge later on.

The existence of a particle requires that there must be a kinetic term of that particle
In the case of newly introduced Aµ above, it is fulﬁlled by adding
in the lagrangian.
the kinetic term using the standard boson lagrangian in Eq. (1). However, it is easy
to verify that the kinetic term (i.e.
(1) is not invariant under
(4). Then one must modify the kinetic term to keep the
the transformation of Eq.
gauge invariance. This can be done by writing down the kinetic term in the form of
anti-symmetric strength tensor Fµν [4],

the ﬁrst term) in Eq.

(3)

(4)

(5)

LA = −

FµνF µν ,

with Fµν ≡ ∂µAν − ∂νAµ, and the factor of 1/4 is just a normalization factor.

On the other hand, the mass term (the second term) in Eq.

(1) is automatically
discarded in this theory since the quadratic term of Aµ is not invariant (and then not
allowed) under transformation in Eq.
In particle physics this result justiﬁes the
interpretation of gauge boson Aµ as photon which is a massless particle.

(4).

Finally, imposing the U(1) gauge symmetry, one ends up with the relativistic version

of electromagnetic theory, known as the quantum electrodynamics (QED),

LQED = i ¯ψγµ(∂µψ) − mψ ¯ψψ − eJ µAµ −

FµνF µν ,

(6)

where J µ ≡ ¯ψγµψ = (ρ, ~J) = (J0, ~J) is the 4-vector current of fermion which satisﬁes the
continuity equation, ∂µJ µ = 0, using the Dirac equation governs the fermionic ﬁeld [5].

2.2 Non-abelian gauge theory

One can furthermore generalize this method by introducing a larger symmetry. This
(so-called) non-abelian transformation can be written as U ≡ exp [−iTaθa(x)], where
Ta’s are matrices called generators belong to a particular Lie group and satisfy certain
4The terminology “local” here means that the parameter θ is space dependent, i.e. θ ≡ θ(x). One

needs also to put a preassumption that the transformation is inﬁnitesimal, i.e. θ ≪ 1.

commutation relation like [Ta, Tb] = ifabcTc, where the anti-symmetric constant fabc is
called the structure function of the group [6]. For an example, a special-unitary Lie group
SU(n) has n2 − 1 generators, and the subscripts a, b, c run over 1, · · · , n2 − 1.

Following exactly the same procedure as Sec.

2.1, one can construct an invari-
ant lagrangian under this transformation. The diﬀerences come only from the non-
commutativeness of the generators. This induces ∂µ → Dµ ≡ ∂µ + igTaAa
µ, and the
non-zero fabc modiﬁes Eq. (4) and the strength tensor Fµν to,

where g is a particular coupling constant as before. One then has the non-abelian (NA)

a ≡ ¯ψγµTaψ, and this again satisﬁes the continuity equation ∂µJ µ

while J µ

For instance, in the case of SU(3) one knows the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to
explain the strong interaction by introducing eight gauge bosons called gluons induced by
its eight generators.

We have so far reviewed shortly the basic of the gauge ﬁeld theory. Now we are ready
to jump into the main part of this paper to construct the NS equation from the gauge
invariant lagrangian, Eqs. (6) and (9).

3 The NS equation from the gauge ﬁeld theory

In the ﬂuid dynamics which is governed by the NS equation we are mostly interested only
in how the forces are mediated, and not in the transition of an initial state to another ﬁnal
state as concerned in particle physics. Within this interest, we need to consider only the
bosonic terms in the total lagrangian. Assuming that the lagrangian is invariant under
certain gauge symmetry explained in the preceding section, we have,

LNS = −

µνF aµν − gJ µ
F a

We put an attention on the current in second term. It should not be considered as the
fermionic current as its original version, since we do not introduce any fermion in our
system. For time being we must consider J µ
a as just a 4-vector current, and it is induced
by diﬀerent mechanism than the internal interaction in the ﬂuid represented by ﬁeld Aa
µ.
Actually it is not a big deal to even put J µ
a = 0 (free ﬁeld lagrangian), or any arbitrary
forms as long as the continuity equation ∂µJ µ

a = 0 is kept.

According to the principle of at-least action for the action S =

d4x LNS, i.e. δS = 0,

one obtains the Euler-Lagrange equation,

If Aµ is considered as a ﬁeld representing a ﬂuid system for each a, then we have multi
ﬂuids system governed by a single form of EOM. Inversely, the current can be derived
from Eq. (12) to get,

and one can easily verify that the continuity equation is kept. We note that this equation
holds for both abelian and non-abelian cases, since the last term in Eq. (8) contributes
nothing due to its anti-symmetry. Also, this reproduces the relativistic version of the
classical electromagnetic density and current of Maxwell.

The next task is to rewrite the above EOM to the familiar NS equation. Let us ﬁrst
consider a single ﬁeld Aµ. Then the task can be accomplished by deﬁning the ﬁeld Aµ in
term of scalar and vector potentials,

Aµ = (A0, Ai) = (φ, ~A)

≡

(cid:19)

where d is an arbitrary parameter with the dimension [d] = 1 to keep correct dimension
for each element of Aµ. V = V (~r) is any potential induced by conservative forces. The
condition for a conservative force ~F is
d~r · ~F = 0 with the solution ~F = ~▽φ. This means
that the potential V must not contain a derivative of spatial space. We are now going to
prove that this choice is correct.

From Eq. (12) it is straightforward to obtain,

Diﬀerent sign in the right hand side merely reﬂects the Minkowski metric we use. Now
we are ready to derive the NS equation. Substituting the 4-vector potensial in Eq. (14)
into Eq. (16), we obtain d ∂0vi + ∂iφ = g ˜Ji or,

d ∂0~v + ~▽φ = g~˜J ,

where ˜Ji ≡ −

arbitrary conservative forces (~▽V ) and some additional forces. This result justiﬁes our
choice for the bosonic ﬁeld in Eq. (14).

Just to mentioned, the potential could represent the already known ones such as,

using the identity ~▽(~▽ · ~v) = ~▽ × ~ω + ~▽2~v. This reproduces two terms relevant

for both compressible and incompressible ﬂuids, while the last term contributes to the
rotational ﬂuid for non-zero ~ω. This provides a natural reason for causality relation
between viscosity and turbulence as stated in the deﬁnition of Reynold number, R ∝ ν−1.
A general NS equation of multi ﬂuids system can ﬁnally be obtained by putting the

Here the second term in the right hand side is a new force relevant for rotational ﬂuid,
while the last term is due to the current or density of ﬂuid.

We would like to note an important issue here. One can take arbitrary current forces
in the NS equation (Eq. (21)), as long as the continuity equation is kept, but should set a
small number for g. This is very crucial since we will use the perturbation method of ﬁeld
theory to perform any calculation in ﬂuid dynamics starting from the lagrangian in Eq.
(10) later on. Taking arbitrary and small enough coupling constant (g ≪ 1) is needed to
ensure that our perturbation works well.

4 Summary and discussion

We have shown that the NS equation can be derived directly from ﬁrst principle of mechan-
ics using relativistic bosonic lagrangian. Using this method, we can treat any conservative
forces in term of the potential V in a general manner. At the same time it predicts an
additional current force (g~˜J) induced by ﬂuid’s current or density, and another one (~v ×~ω)
relevant for rotational ﬂuid.

In this approach we have more freedom on deﬁning the forms of ﬂuid’s current and
density, and are able to further expand the theory by introducing new forces (interactions)
in the lagrangian as long as the continuity equation and symmetry are kept. Also it is
straightforward to relate the NS equation with the Maxwell equation, because both of
them have been constructed from the same lagrangian and (abelian gauge) symmetry as
well.

Another interesting result is, in principle, we are able to discuss multi ﬂuids system

consistently, for example, one can consider a system with a lagrangian,

Ltotal = LA

NS + LB

NS + LAB

int

,

(22)

to represent mixing of two fuids A and B. Here the interaction term LAB
is choosen such
int
that the symmetry is kept. This opens a possibility to calculate interactions among multi

6

a

ﬂuids with diﬀerent conditions characterized by diﬀerent velocities ~va and current forces
g~˜J
with only one lagrangian as Eq. (22). These points and applications of using this
lagrangian will be discussed in detail in the subsequent paper [8].

We would like to note an important issue in this approach. That is, a more com-
prehensive explanation to bring the (non-relativistic-like) form of bosonic ﬁeld Aµ as Eq.
(14) is needed. Actually, one should take a (relativistic-like) form of Aµ which can repro-
duce the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation using the same approach, and it coincides at
non-relativistic limit with the form of Eq. (14). We are now working on this issue.

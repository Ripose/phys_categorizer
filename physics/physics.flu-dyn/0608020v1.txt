In this study of catalytic microﬂuidic reactors we show that, when optimally structured, these
reactors share underlying scaling properties. The scaling is predicted theoretically and veriﬁed
numerically. Furthermore, we show how to increase the reaction rate signiﬁcantly by distributing the
active porous material within the reactor using a high-level implementation of topology optimization.

Chemical processes play a key role for the production
and analysis of many substances and materials needed
in industry and heath care. Generally, the optimiza-
tion of these processes is an important goal, and with
the introduction of microﬂuidic reactors involving lami-
nar ﬂows, the resulting concentration distributions mean
better control and utilization of the reactors [1]. These
conditions make it possible to design reactors using the
method of topology optimization [2], which recently has
been applied to ﬂuidic design of increasing complexity
[3, 4, 5].

First, we report the ﬁnding of scaling properties of such
optimal reactors. To illustrate the method we study a
simple model of a chemical reactor, in which the desired
product arises from a single ﬁrst-order catalytic reaction
due to a catalyst immobilized on a porous medium ﬁlling
large regions of the reactor.

Next, we show that topology optimization can be em-
ployed to design optimal chemical micro-reactors. The
goal of the optimization is to maximize the mean reaction
rate of the micro-reactor by ﬁnding the optimal porosity
distribution of the porous catalytic support. Despite the
simplicity of the model, our work shows that topology
optimization of the design of the porous support inside
the reactor can increase the reaction rate signiﬁcantly.

Our model system is a ﬁrst-order catalytic reaction,
A C
B, taking place inside a microﬂuidic reactor of
−→
length L, containing a porous medium of spatially vary-
ing porosity γ(r) and a buﬀer ﬂuid ﬁlling the pores. The
porosity γ is deﬁned as the local volume fraction occu-
pied by the buﬀer ﬂuid [6], and it can vary continuously
from zero to unity, where γ = 0 is the limit of dense
material (vanishingly small pores) and γ = 1 is the limit
of pure ﬂuid (no porous material). The reactant A and
the product B are dissolved with concentrations a and b,
respectively, in the buﬀer ﬂuid, which is driven through
the reactor by a constant, externally applied pressure
diﬀerence ∆p between an inlet and outlet channel. The
catalyst C is immobilized with concentration c on the
porous support.

The working principle of the reactor is quite simple.
The buﬀer ﬂuid carries the reactant A through the porous
medium supporting the catalyst C. The reaction rate is
high if at the same time the reactant A is supplied at a

high rate and the amount of immobilized catalyst C is
large. However, these two conditions are contradictory.
For a given pressure drop ∆p the supply rate of A is high
if γ is high allowing for a large ﬂow rate of the buﬀer
ﬂuid. Conversely, the amount of catalyst C is high if
γ is low corresponding to a dense porous support with
a large active region. Consequently, an optimal design
of the porous support must exist involving intermediate
values of the porosity. Besides, the optimal design may
involve an intricate distribution of porous support within
the reactor, and to ﬁnd this we employ the method of
topology optimization in the implementation of Ref. [5].
In the steady-state limit, the reaction kinetics is given
by the following advection-diﬀusion-reaction equation for
the reactant concentration a,

Here u(γ) is the velocity ﬁeld of the buﬀer ﬂuid, D is
the diﬀusion constant of the reactant in the buﬀer, and
k(γ) a is the reaction term of the ﬁrst order isothermal

reaction, which depends on the concentration of the cata-
lyst C through γ(r). In this problem three characteristic
timescales τA, τR and τD naturally arise,

which correspond directly to the advection, diﬀusion, and
reaction term in Eq. (1), respectively. These time-scales
will be used in the following theoretical analysis. Note
that the index of Ω generally denote an average over the
k(γ)
design region, e.g., kΩ =
h
The porosity ﬁeld γ(r) uniquely characterizes the re-
actor design since it determines both the distribution of
the catalyst and the ﬂow of the buﬀer. In the Navier–
Stokes equation, governing the ﬂow of the buﬀer, the
presence of the porous support can be modelled by a
α(γ) u, where α is the
Darcy damping force density
local, porosity-dependent, inverse permeability[7]. As-
suming further that the buﬀer ﬂuid is an incompressible
liquid of density ρ and dynamic viscosity η, the governing
equations of the buﬀer in steady-state become

The coupling between α and γ is given by the function
q(1−γ)
q+γ , where αmax is determined by the
α(γ)
non-dimensional Darcy number Da =
αmax L2 , and q is a
positive parameter used to ensure global convergence of
the topology optimization method[3, 5]. In this work Da
is typically around 10−5, resulting in a strong damping of
the buﬀer ﬂow inside the porous support. The model is
solved for a given γ(r) by ﬁrst ﬁnding u(γ) from Eqs. (3a)
and (3b) and then a(r) from Eq. (1).

Our aim is to optimize the average reaction-rate
(k(γ) a)Ω of the reactor by ﬁnding the optimal porosity
ﬁeld γ(r). We therefore introduce the following objective
function Φ(γ), which by convention has to be minimized,

Φ(γ) =

(k(γ) a)Ω.

To better characterize the performance of the reactor
and to introduce the related quantities, we ﬁrst analyze
a simple 1D model deﬁned on the x-axis. The porous
medium is placed in the reaction region Ω extending from
x = 0 to x = L. Eq. (3b) leads to a constant ﬂow velocity
u, and as the complete pressure-drop occurs in the porous
medium, we have p(0) = p0 + ∆p and p(L) = p0. In this
case the boundary conditions for the advection-diﬀusion-
reaction equation Eq. (1) are a(
) = 0,
−∞
and a′(
) = 0, where the primes indicate x-derivatives.
We denote the outlet concentration a(
) = aL. From
Eqs. (1) and (4), we then derive the following expression
of the objective function

To solve the 1D optimization problem analytically, we
chose to abandon the spatial variations of γ in the 1D
model. We have to ﬁnd the solutions to ∂Φ
0, and
from Eqs. (6) and (8), we end up by having to solve the
following equation

where we have assumed that k(γΩ)
ciﬁc properties of the catalytic reaction determines the
value of β, e.g., if the full volume of the porous medium
is active then β = 1, while if only the surface is active
then β = 2/3. Solving Eq. (11) gives the optimal value
of δβ, where the reference to β now is explicit.

All numerical solutions are found using the commer-
cial numerical modelling-tools Matlab[9] and COMSOL
[10]. To validate numerically the analytic results of the
1D model, we solve Eqs. (1) and (10) for a given homoge-
neous design variable γΩ and ﬁnd the optimal value using
a brute-force optimization method [11].

To obtain a general scaling parameter for the prob-
lem deﬁned in Eq. (1) we reintroduce diﬀusion. How-
ever, to minimize the trivial inﬂuence from the inlet and
outlet, we only study the limit of low diﬀusion, e.g.,
τA, τR. In this limit the optimal reactors involve
τD ≫
a balance between the advection and reaction processes,
and consequently we expect that τA and τR, should enter
on equal footing in the scaling parameter. We are there-
fore led to propose the following dimensional-less form of
the scaling-parameter

Figure 1 shows that the measured values of δβ and
β for optimal porosity both scale with respect to
C
√τA τR/τD. The simulations cover 512 optimal reactors
in a wide and dense parameter-scan [12], and as they col-
lapse almost perfectly on single curves, we have not dis-
tinguished the data-points further. In the non-diﬀusive
case D = 0 and √τA τR/τD = 0, exact values of δβ and
β
are determined by Eqs. (8) and (11), and they match ex-
actly with the numerical results, as seen in Fig. 1, where
they are marked by circles on the ordinate.

We now introduce three types of 2D reactors:

the
uniform reactors, Fig. 2(a), the membrane reactors,
Fig. 2(b), and the topology optimized reactors, for which
a few is shown in Fig. 3. First we optimize the simple re-
actors in Fig. 2. They both depend only on one variable,
which for the uniform reactor is the uniform porosity ˜γ,

and for the membrane reactor is the width ℓ of a porous
membrane of porosity γ∗
0 [11]. Because of mirror-
≡
symmetry in the xz-plane, only the upper half of the
reactors are solved in all the following work.

In the third type of 2D reactors we let the porosity
γ(r) vary freely within the same design region as for
the uniform reactor. The optimal design is found us-
ing the topology optimization method, described in de-
tail in Ref. [5]. This is an iterative method, in which,
starting from an initial guess γ0 of the design variable,
the nth iteration consists of ﬁrst solving the systems for
the given design variable γn, then evaluating the sensi-
tivities ∂Φ
∂γ by solving a corresponding adjoint problem,
and ﬁnally obtaining an improved updated γn+1 by use
of the ”method of moving asymptotes” (MMA)[13, 14].
In Fig. 3 is shown a representative collection of topology
optimized designs together with the corresponding ﬂow
speed u, concentration a, reaction rate k(γ)a, and param-

eter values. In the large parameter space under investiga-
tion, our work shows a systematic decrease of pore-sizes
and the emergence of ﬁner structures in the topology op-
timized reactors as the scaling parameter √τA τR/τD is
decreased.

In Fig. 4 the conversion

is plotted as a function of
C
√τA τR/τD for all optimal reactors of this work. It shows
that all reactors collapse on curves similar to the 1D reac-
tors, although the topology optimized reactors exhibit a
larger spread. We believe that this scaling is a signature
of a general property of optimal immobilized catalytic re-
actors. Note that the conversion of the uniform reactor
in the low diﬀusion limit is a few percent higher than the
theoretical estimate, an eﬀect caused by low convection
in the corners, resulting in ’dead zones’.

In terms of the objective function Φ the topologically
optimized reactors are signiﬁcant improved compared to
the simple 2D reactors. To investigate the nature behind
this improvement, we show in Fig. 5 a log-log plot of the

of the objective function Φ
, the rate of improve-
∼
ment with respect to the uniform reactors can be read
oﬀ directly, as the contours of the improvement-factors
of Φ become straight lines, as showed by the dashed lines
labelled by the corresponding factors in Fig. 5. It is seen
that topology optimization can increase the reaction rate
of the optimal reactors by nearly a factor 20, and further-
more it does so by increasing the ﬂow rate at the expense
of lower conversions. The important insight thus gained
is that the distribution of the advected reactant by the
microﬂuidic channel network over a large area at mini-
mal pressure-loss plays a signiﬁcant role when optimizing
microreactors.

To conclude, we have analyzed a single ﬁrst-order cat-
alytic reaction in a laminar microﬂuidic reactor with opti-
mal distribution of porous catalyst. The ﬂow is pressure-
driven and the ﬂow through the porous medium is mod-
elled using a simple Darcy damping force. Our goal has
solely been to optimize the average reaction rate, with
no constrains on the conversion or the catalytic prop-
erties. A characterization of the optimal conﬁguration
has been derived theoretically and validated numerically.
It shows an general scaling behavior, depending only on
the reaction properties of the catalyst. The analysis is
based on a very simple reaction since this emphasizes
the points that the optimization of even simple reactions
result in to non-trivial scaling properties and complex
optimal designs. Using topology optimization to design
optimal reactors give rise to reaction rate improvements
of close to a factor 20, compared to an corresponding op-
timal uniform reactor, and the improvement originates
mainly due to an improved transport and distribution of
the reactant. Furthermore, for the topology optimized
reactors, we have found a systematic decrease of pore-
sizes and the emergence of ﬁner structures as the scaling
parameter is decreased. Our work points out a new, gen-
eral, and potentially very powerful method of improving
microﬂuidic reactors.

Abstract.
ideal, time-
In this article we study the asymptotic behavior of incompressible,
dependent two dimensional ﬂow in the exterior of a single smooth obstacle when the size of the
obstacle becomes very small. Our main purpose is to identify the equation satisﬁed by the limit
ﬂow. We will see that the asymptotic behavior depends on γ, the circulation around the obstacle.
For smooth ﬂow around a single obstacle, γ is a conserved quantity which is determined by the
initial data. We will show that if γ = 0, the limit ﬂow satisﬁes the standard incompressible Euler
equations in the full plane but, if γ 6= 0, the limit equation acquires an additional forcing term. We
treat this problem by ﬁrst constructing a sequence of approximate solutions to the incompressible
2D Euler equation in the full plane from the exact solutions obtained when solving the equation on
the exterior of each obstacle and then passing to the limit on the weak formulation of the equation.
We use an explicit treatment of the Green’s function of the exterior domain based on conformal
maps, a priori estimates obtained by carefully examining the limiting process and the Div-Curl
Lemma, together with a standard weak convergence treatment of the nonlinearity for the passage
to the limit.

1. Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded, connected and simply connected domain of the plane with smooth
boundary Γ and, for each ε > 0, let Ωε ≡ εΩ with boundary Γε. We consider a family
uε = uε(x, t) of incompressible ﬂows which satisfy the two-dimensional Euler equations on
the exterior of Ωε, with velocity tangent to Γε and satisfying the initial conditions (i) the
initial vorticity ω0(x) = curl uε(x, 0) is independent of ε and the support of ω0 does not
intersect the origin and (ii) the circulation around Γε of the velocity uε is a real constant γ
which does not depend on ε either. Our purpose in this article is to identify the asymptotic
behavior when ε → 0 of the sequence {uε}. We will prove that for γ = 0, uε converges
to a ﬂow u satisfying the incompressible two dimensional Euler equations in the full plane
with initial vorticity ω0 and that, for γ 6= 0, any weak limit of the sequence {uε} satisﬁes
a modiﬁcation of the Euler equations which, in the vorticity formulation, takes the aspect
of an additional convection term.

In order to clarify the issues involved in this problem, let us consider that, for each
ﬁxed time, the velocity u of the ﬂow around a small obstacle decomposed as u = uo + ub,
where ub is the background velocity, which is slowly varying with respect to the scale of
the obstacle, incorporating what we imagine the ﬂow velocity would be if the obstacle was
not present, and uo is the correction to ub due to the presence of the obstacle. As the
obstacle disappears towards a point p, the background ﬂow ub appears as a constant ﬂow
background ub(p) relative to an observer on the obstacle. One can see that, when ub(p) 6= 0,
the fact that the full velocity u is tangent to the obstacle means that uo has to be a large
perturbation in absolute value. On the other hand, one expects the perturbation produced
by the small obstacle to be sharply localized, so that |uo| should converge pointwise to zero
away from the obstacle. The small obstacle generates large velocity gradients in a nearby
region. How this eﬀect inﬂuences the limiting process is the main point of the present
work.

It is a well known fact that the ideal ﬂow assumption is physically inappropriate to
model the behavior of the ﬂow near an obstacle, due to boundary layer eﬀects. Hence, the
whole issue of small obstacle asymptotics would be more physically meaningful if posed
for the Navier-Stokes equations. The asymptotics of the ideal ﬂow case which we present
here should be regarded as a ﬁrst step towards the rigorous analysis of the small obstacle
problem.

Most of the work on time-dependent, incompressible exterior ﬂow has been in the nature
of well-posedness through energy methods, see [6, 7]. Energy estimates are global, so that
it would be diﬃcult to treat our sharply localized problem through such means. The
alternative is to adopt the vortex dynamics point of view. This means understanding

2

2D ﬂow in terms of the description of the dynamics of vorticity, an approach which has
been very fruitful recently. The most important recent results on 2D Euler are Chemin’s
Theorem, on the regularity of vortex patches, see [2], which is by nature a vortex dynamics
result, and Delort’s Existence Theorem, see [3], which relies heavily on the vortex dynamics
point of view.

Our interest in the small obstacle problem was motivated by the problem of conﬁnement
of vorticity. Let us examine brieﬂy the nature of this problem and survey some of the
results obtained thus far. Consider ω = ω(x, t) a (classical) solution of the full plane 2D
Euler equations such that ω(x, 0) is compactly supported. The problem of conﬁnement
of vorticity is to obtain control over the growth of the diameter of the support of ω(·, t).
Current research on this subject originates with a result obtained by C. Marchioro in [10].
He proved that the solution of the incompressible 2D Euler equations in the full plane,
with bounded, nonnegative initial vorticity with support contained in the ball B(0; R0),
will have, at time t, its support contained in a ball of radius R(t) = (bt + R3
0)1/3, for some
constant b ≥ 0. The state-of-the-art conﬁnement result in the full plane has almost fourth
root exponent, see [5, 13]. In [11], Marchioro addressed the problem of conﬁnement for
exterior ﬂow. Using the techniques developed for full plane ﬂow, Marchioro proved cubic-
root conﬁnement for the exterior of a disk and almost square root conﬁnement for a general
exterior domain. We will not get into the issue of why the conﬁnement result is sensitive
to the presence and to the geometry of the domain, but we observe that conﬁnement is
connected to the way an obstacle inﬂuences very distant particles, called far-ﬁeld eﬀects.
The scaling behavior of the incompressible Euler equations makes the problem of describing
the inﬂuence of a very distant obstacle for a very long time naturally associated to observing
the eﬀect of a vanishingly small nearby obstacle for some time, which is the object of this
article. In this context, the inﬂuence of the precise shape of the small domain in the vortex
motion is of particular interest.

From the technical standpoint, this article makes use of the techniques of weak con-
vergence methods for the asymptotic analysis. Such methods have often been developed
for proving existence of weak solutions, see for example [3, 9], but they are well suited
for studying singular limits in general. The basic ingredients of the present proof are a
collection of a priori estimates obtained mainly through exhaustive use of explicit formulas
for the Green’s function of the exterior domain and strong compactness of approximate
velocities obtained by using the parametrized div-curl Theorem introduced in [9].

The remainder of this paper is divided into ﬁve sections. In the second section, included
mostly for completeness’ sake and for ﬁxing notation, we collect information on classical
potential theory for the Laplacian in an exterior domain and on holomorphic maps as
required to write explicit formulas for the Green’s function in terms of the Riemann map
associated to the obstacle. In the third section we formulate precisely the exterior ﬂow
problem and the problem of small obstacle asymptotics. In the fourth section we derive the
collection of a priori estimates required for the passage to the limit, identifying a collection
of quantities that remain under control in the small obstacle asymptotics. We prove our
main result in the ﬁfth section, identifying the PDE in the full plane satisﬁed by the limit

investigation on this problem.

2. The Laplacian in an exterior domain

The purpose of this section is to collect a number of facts associated to classical potential
theory for the Laplacian on an exterior domain in the plane. We claim no originality
on these results, although the explicit form in which they are presented is not the one
commonly found in the literature. We include a thorough discussion here for the sake of
completeness.

2.1. Conformal maps. Let Ω be a bounded, open, simply connected subset of the plane,
whose boundary, denoted by Γ, is a C ∞ Jordan curve. We will denote by Π the unbounded
connected component of R2 − Γ, so that Ωc = Π. Let D = B(0; 1), S = ∂D.

In what follows we identify R2 with the complex plane C. We begin by constructing a

smooth biholomorphism between Π and {x ∈ R2 | |x| > 1} ≡ int Dc.

Lemma 2.1. Let Π = int Ωc be as above. There exists a smooth biholomorphism T :
Π → int Dc, extending smoothly up to the boundary, mapping Γ to S. Furthermore, there
exists a nonzero real number β and a bounded holomorphic function h : Π → C such that:
T (z) = βz + h(z).
(2.1)

Additionally,

(2.2)

h′(z) = O

, as |z| → ∞.

1
|z|2 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Proof. We may assume without loss of generality that B(0; 1) ⊂ Ω. If this were not the
case then suitable dilation and translation would make it so.

For z ∈ Π, consider the holomorphic map given by z 7→ I(z) = 1/z and denote by
Ω,
Γ, the image of Π, Γ respectively, under this map. There exists a biholomorphism R from
e
Γ to S. Since Γ was
Ω ∪ {0} to B(0; 1) given by the Riemann Mapping Theorem, mapping
e
Γ, hence R and its inverse R−1 have continuous
assumed to be a C ∞ Jordan curve so is
e
extensions up to the boundary, along with all their derivatives (see [1]). We choose the
Riemann mapping R such that R(0) = 0 and we deﬁne T to be given by the compositions:
T = I ◦ R ◦ I. It is easy to see that T is a biholomorphism, continuous up to Γ, along with
all of its derivatives.

e

e

Consider the function f deﬁned by

R(z) = zf (z), z ∈

Ω.

Ω which cannot vanish at 0 since R is a bijection. By
This is a holomorphic function on
the same token, f cannot vanish anywhere else in the closure of
Ω. It follows that 1/f (z) is
also a holomorphic function. Hence we can write 1/f (z) = β + zg(z), with g a holomorphic
function and β = 1/f (0). We ﬁnd g(z) = −(f (z) − f (0))/f (0)R(z), which can be seen to
be bounded since z = 0 is a zero of order 1 for R and f is bounded.

Thus we obtain

T (z) = 1/R(1/z) = z(β + (1/z)g(1/z)) = βz + g(1/z).

The desired function h is given by h(z) = g(1/z). We may assume without loss of generality
that β is real by multiplying the function T constructed above by β/|β| if necessary, which
does not change the desired properties. Finally, we observe that

h′(z) = −

1
z2 g′

z (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

and, by construction, g′ is a holomorphic function in

Ω, bounded in the closure.

Remark 2.1. It follows by construction of T that

e

T ′(z) = R′(1/z)/(f (1/z))2,

which can be easily seen to be bounded from above and below. Therefore, if we make the
canonical identiﬁcation of R2 with C, writing z = x1 + ix2 for the point x = (x1, x2), then,
if DT stands for the Jacobian matrix associated to T ′, there exist a positive constant C
such that

(2.3)

kDT kL∞ ≤ C and kDT −1kL∞ ≤ C.

2.2. Explicit formulas for the Green’s function. Here we will obtain an explicit
formula for the Green’s function of the Laplacian in Π in terms of the conformal mapping
above. We denote this Green’s function by GΠ = GΠ(x, y); we must have ∆yGΠ(x, y) =
δ(y − x), GΠ(x, y) = 0 for y ∈ Γ and GΠ(x, y) = GΠ(y, x). If Ω = B(0; 1) and if we write
x∗ = x/|x|2 then there is a unique Green’s function which can be written explicitly as

GDc(x, y) =

log

1
2π

|x − y|
|x − y∗||y|

.

It is easy to verify that if x0 ∈ (B(0; 1))c and h satisﬁes ∆h = δ(x−x0) in a neighborhood
of x0 then ˜h ≡ h ◦ T satisﬁes ∆˜h = δ(y − T −1(x0)) in a neighborhood of T −1(x0). We use
this fact on G to write:

(2.4)

GΠ(x, y) =

log

1
2π

|T (x) − T (y)|
|T (x) − (T (y))∗||T (y)|

.

We will concern ourselves mostly with ﬁrst order derivatives of the Green’s function,
x GΠ(x, y). The explicit

which we will introduce through the notation KΠ = KΠ(x, y) ≡ ∇⊥
formula for KΠ is given by

(2.5)

KΠ(x, y) =

((T (x) − T (y))DT (x))⊥
2π|T (x) − T (y)|2

−

((T (x) − (T (y))∗)DT (x))⊥
2π|T (x) − (T (y))∗|2

.

Note that KΠ(x, y) = DT t(x)KDc(T (x), T (y)).

We require information on far-ﬁeld behavior of KΠ. We will use several times the fol-

lowing general relation:

(2.6)

which can be readily checked by squaring both sides.

We now ﬁnd from the estimates (2.3), (2.5) and (2.6), that

For f ∈ C ∞

c (Π), we introduce the notation

(2.7)

KΠ[f ] = KΠ[f ](x) ≡

KΠ(x, y)f (y)dy.

ZΠ

It is easy to see that the pointwise estimate for KΠ above, yields, for large |x|, the

estimate:

(2.8)

where the constant C > 0 depends on the size of the support of f . In the last inequality
we have used the explicit formula for the biholomorphism T (2.1).

Lemma 2.2. The vector ﬁeld u = KΠ[f ] is a solution to the elliptic system:

|KΠ[f ]|(x) ≤

div u = 0 in Π
curl u = f in Π
u · ˆn = 0 on Γ
lim|x|→∞ |u| = 0.



The proof of this Lemma is straightforward.

2.3. Harmonic Vector Fields. The standard version of Hodge’s Theorem is proved for
compact manifolds, see [16], with a natural extension to compact manifolds with boundary.
Extending Hodge’s Theory to noncompact manifolds is a diﬃcult problem, see [8] for a
broad overview. There is a lot of special structure for the exterior domain, speciﬁcally the
complex structure, which allows us to prove an elementary extension of Hodge’s Theorem
to this particular case. It is no surprise that this extension is valid, moreover, such a fact
has been extensively used in the literature. As before, we include a complete discussion
here because we will require the very explicit treatment involved for the remainder of this
article.

Let Ω be a bounded, open subset of R2 whose boundary Γ is a smooth Jordan curve and
let Π = int Ωc. We will denote by ˆn the unit normal exterior to Ωc at Γ. In what follows all

Proposition 2.1. There exists a unique classical solution H = HΠ of the problem

(2.9)

div H = 0, in Π,
curl H = 0, in Π,
H · ˆn = 0 on Γ,
|H| → 0 as x → ∞,
Γ H · ds = 1.
R






Moreover, HΠ = O(1/|x|) when |x| → ∞.

Proof. We will start by proving uniqueness. Let us assume there are two solutions H1, H2
and consider their diﬀerence H = H1 − H2. Since the problem is linear H is a harmonic
vector ﬁeld with zero circulation. We must show that H vanishes identically. Let us begin
by estimating H at inﬁnity. We will use the canonical identiﬁcation of R2 with C, writing
z = x1 + ix2 instead of x = (x1, x2). First note that H = O(|x|−1) as x → ∞. To see
this consider the holomorphic function f = f (z) = ¯H(1/z). The singularity at z = 0 is
clearly removable and hence f is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin. Furthermore
f (0) = 0, which implies that f (z)/z is also holomorphic in a neighborhood of 0. Thus we
have shown the desired behavior at inﬁnity. Next, note that, after an easy calculation we
ﬁnd, for any real vector ﬁeld L,

(2.10)

¯Ldz =

IΓ

ZΓ

L · ds − i

L · ˆnds.

ZΓ

Using this identity for H we conclude that the contour integral of ¯H on Γ vanishes. Since
¯H is holomorphic in Ωc, its contour integral on any closed curve enclosing Ω vanishes as
well. Let us consider the Taylor expansion of f = f (z) at z = 0, f (z) = cz + O(z2). Fix
ε > 0 suitably small. We have that:

2πic =

f (z)
z2 dz =

I|z|=ε

I|w|=ε−1

¯H(w)dw = 0.

From this we conclude that actually H = O(|x|−2) as x → ∞.

Next we observe that, since H is curl-free and has zero circulation, there exists a function
ϕ such that H = ∇ϕ. This function is constructed by integrating along arbitrary paths.
From the behavior of H at inﬁnity and the construction of ϕ we have that |ϕ(x)| = O(|x|−1)
as x → ∞.

Let us now use the estimates gathered above to show that H ≡ 0. We integrate:

|H|2dx = lim

|H|2dx = lim

by integration by parts and using the fact that H is tangent to Γ. This limit vanishes
because of the behavior of ϕ and H at inﬁnity. Thus we conclude that H is identically
zero in Ωc.

7

We now obtain the existence of a classical solution. Let T be the biholomorphic mapping
from Lemma 2.1. Let ψ = ψ(z) = log |T (z)| for z ∈ Ωc. Since the logarithm is a harmonic
function in B(0; 1)c and T is analytic in Π it follows that ψ is a harmonic function of x.
Furthermore ψ ≡ 0 on Γ. Deﬁne U ≡ ∇⊥ψ = (−∂x2ψ, ∂x1ψ). It can be easily checked that
U satisﬁes all but one of the conditions in system (2.9), namely the condition on circulation
on Γ. Since U is not identically zero it follows from the uniqueness part of the proof that

U · ds = c 6= 0,

ZΓ

and hence we may take HΠ = U/c.

Finally we address the asymptotic behavior of HΠ at inﬁnity. Recall that, in the be-
ginning of the proof of uniqueness above, we showed that the diﬀerence of two solutions
behaved like O(|x|−1) as x → ∞. The argument we gave did not depend on the circulation
of the diﬀerence H. Therefore the same argument can be used with H1 = HΠ and H2 = 0
to show the desired behavior for HΠ.

By construction the harmonic vector ﬁeld HΠ above is given by

HΠ(x) = C∇⊥ log |T (x)|,
for some constant C. We argue that C = 1/2π. Indeed, it is an easy calculation to prove
that

¯HΠ(z) = −Ci(log T )′(z) = −Ci

T ′(z)
T (z)

.

Using (2.10) together with the fact that HΠ is tangent to Γ we ﬁnd:

HΠ · ds =

dz = C

so that we must have C = 1/2π in order to satisfy the last condition of system (2.9).

3. Flow in an exterior domain

The purpose of this section is to formulate precisely the small obstacle limit.

3.1. The initial-boundary value problem. We begin by formulating precisely the
initial-boundary value problem for incompressible ideal ﬂuid ﬂow in an exterior domain.
Let Γ be, as before, a smooth Jordan curve in the plane, dividing it into a bounded con-
nected component, which we call Ω and an unbounded connected component denoted Π.
For x ∈ Γ, denote by ˆn(x) the exterior normal to Ωc at x, as before.

Let u = u(x, t) = (u1(x1, x2, t), u2(x1, x2, t)) be the velocity of an incompressible, ideal
ﬂuid in Ωc. We assume that u is tangent to Γ and u → 0 when |x| → ∞. The evolution

8

of such a ﬂow is governed by the Euler equations. We write the initial-boundary value
problem as:

(3.1)

ut + u · ∇u = −∇p
div u = 0
u · ˆn = 0
lim|x|→∞ |u| = 0
u(x, 0) = u0(x)

in Π × (0, ∞)
in Π × [0, ∞)
on Γ × [0, ∞)
for t ∈ [0, ∞)
in Ωc,






where p = p(x, t) is the scalar pressure. If u0 is suﬃciently smooth, global well-posedness
of this problem was proved by K. Kikuchi in [6].

Let ω = curl u be the vorticity associated to this ﬂow.

In order to write a vorticity
formulation of problem (3.1) we must be able to recover velocity from vorticity. The
coupling of velocity and vorticity is given by the elliptic system

div u = 0 in Π × [0, ∞)
curl u = ω in Π × [0, ∞)
u · ˆn = 0 on Γ × [0, ∞)
lim|x|→∞ |u| = 0 for t ∈ [0, ∞).





In view of Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.1 this system has a unique solution up to a
harmonic vector ﬁeld, given by u = u(x, t) = KΠ[ω(·, t)](x) + αHΠ(x), for some time-
dependent function α = α(t).

Lemma 3.1. If u is a smooth solution of (3.1) then α is constant in time.

Proof. We introduce the stream function ψ = ψ(x, t) given by:

(3.2)

ψ(x, t) ≡ GΠ[ω](x, t) =

GΠ(x, y)ω(y, t)dy.

Next, we observe that, by Kelvin’s Circulation Theorem, the circulation of u around Γ

is constant in time. Hence we have:

γ =

u · ds =

∇⊥ψ · ds + α(t)

HΠ · ds = α(t) −

3.2. The evanescent obstacle. In this subsection we will formulate a family of problems,
parametrized by the size of the obstacle, in order to identify the asymptotic limit under
c (R2) and assume that the origin does not belong to
consideration. Fix ω0 = ω0(x) ∈ C ∞
the support of ω0. Let Ω be a domain in the plane satisfying the hypothesis of Lemma 2.1.
We will consider the family of rescaled domains Ωε ≡ εΩ and we note that there exists ε0
such that, for all 0 < ε ≤ ε0, the support of ω0 does not intersect Ωε.

Let Γε = ∂Ωε and Πε = int Ωc

ε. We denote the harmonic vector ﬁeld given by Propo-
sition 2.1 by H ε = HΠε. We also denote the Green’s function for Πε by Gε and the
corresponding kernel (and integral operator) K ε = ∇⊥Gε.

Consider the system (Eε) given below:

(Eε) 


ωε
t + uε · ∇ωε = 0,
uε = K ε[ωε] + αH ε,
ωε(x, 0) = ω0(x),

in Πε × (0, ∞)
in Πε × [0, ∞)
in Πε.

It follows from the work of Kikuchi [6] that, for any ε > 0, if ω0 is suﬃciently smooth then
this system has a unique smooth solution.



(3.4)

In fact, Kikuchi’s result asserts existence for the velocity formulation of (Eε), which
means that there exists a pressure pε such that uε and pε are a solution of problem (3.1)
in the domain Πε with initial velocity
0 = K ε[ω0] + αH ε.
uε
Consider T the biholomorphism from Π to int Dc constructed in Lemma 2.1. Observe
that T ε(z) ≡ T (z/ε) deﬁnes a biholomorphism between Πε and int Dc, which extends
smoothly up to the boundary and which maps Γε to S. We can use T ε to write explicit
formulas for K ε and H ε, by recalling (2.5) and (2.11). We have

estimate (3.7) follows easily.

4. A priori estimates

In this section we will prove the a priori estimates on uε and ωε which are required to

identify their asymptotic behavior.

4.1. Velocity estimate. The key ingredients on the rigorous treatment of weak solutions
for the incompressible Euler equations are usually the energy estimate on velocity and
estimates on vorticity based on the fact that the vorticity is rearranged by incompressible
ﬂow, i.e. the distribution function of vorticity is a constant of motion. There are numerous
instances of this observation, and we refer the reader to [9] for a systematic discussion. For
the problem in hand, the usual rearrangement estimates on vorticity hold for the sequence
ωε, due to the transport nature of equation (Eε). For ε small enough, so that the support
of ω0 is compactly contained on Πε we have the a priori bounds

(4.1)

kωε(·, t)kL∞(Πε) = kω0kL∞(R2) and kωε(·, t)kL1(Πε) = kω0kL1(R2)

On the other hand, we are not able to use the energy estimate in the usual way. In order
to explain what is at play here, let us illustrate the behavior of the velocity as ε → 0 with
an explicit example.

Example: Let Ωε = B(0; ε), so that Πε = {|x| > ε}. We consider the vorticity

ω = ω(x) ≡

1 if 1 ≤ |x| ≤ 2
0 otherwise,

(cid:26)

which is a stationary solution of (Eε) for any ε < 1.

The ﬁnite energy part of the associated velocity is vε ≡ K ε[ω], which, after straightfor-

ward calculations gives

vε(x) =

if ε ≤ |x| < 1

if |x| ≥ 2

Clearly, there is (logarithmic) local blow-up of the kinetic energy as ε → 0. The harmonic
vector ﬁeld associated to Πε is the restriction of H(x) = x⊥/2π|x|2 to Πε, so that the full
velocity is uε = vε + αH. If we want to single out a locally uniformly square integrable
portion of uε for estimating we must add a well chosen part of αH to vε. We consider
uε = (vε + 3πH) + (α − 3π)H. Neither part of this decomposition is square-integrable at
inﬁnity, but vε + 3πH is not only uniformly bounded in L2
loc but it is actually uniformly
bounded in L∞. We observe that 3π =
ω(x)dx. The purpose of this subsection is to
prove that something similar holds in general.

Returning to the general sequence ωε, uε, assume again that ε is small enough so that

the support of ω0 is compactly contained in Πε. We introduce

We begin by estimating I1. Using (2.3) we get

where χE is the characteristic function of the set E. We change variables back and we get:
kf ε(·, t)kL1(R2) = kωε(·, t)kL1(R2),

(4.4)

and, since by (2.3) J is bounded, we ﬁnd that

kf ε(·, t)kL∞(R2) ≤ CkωεkL∞.

We deduce from (4.2) and (4.3) that

This last inequality is Lemma 2.1 in [5]. According to (4.4) and (4.5) this concludes the
estimate for I1.

Hence,

Also, it is trivial to see that

where we have used relations (4.8) and (4.9) in the last inequality. This concludes the
proof.

Remark 4.1. It follows from (4.1) that the estimate for vε in Theorem 4.1 is uniform in ε
and t.

4.2. Harmonic vector ﬁelds and the cutoﬀ function. The other estimates we require
in order to study the asymptotic problem involve derivatives of velocity. Before we begin
examining these estimates we must address the issue that ωε and uε are deﬁned on an
ε-dependent domain, and if we want to explore their asymptotics, and, to use standard
functional analysis reasoning, we must make sure they are all in the same function space.
We will introduce a suitable ε-dependent cutoﬀ function for a neighborhood of Ωε which,
for reasons which will become clear in the next section, is adapted to the geometry of the
domains.

Let φ ∈ C ∞(R) a cutoﬀ function with the properties that 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1, φ is monotone
increasing, φ(s) = 1 if s ≥ 2 and φ(s) ≡ 0 is s ≤ 1 + a, for some 0 < a < 1. For x ∈ Πε, set
φε = φε(x) = φ(|T ε(x)|) = φ(|T (x/ε)|),
and φε(x) = 0 for x ∈ Ωε. Clearly φε ∈ C ∞(R2), vanishing on a neighborhood of Ωε. We
require some properties of ∇φε, which we collect in the following Lemma.

Lemma 4.1. The cutoﬀ φε deﬁned above has the following properties:

14

(a) if H ε is the harmonic vector ﬁeld for Πε then H ε · ∇φε ≡ 0 in Πε,
(b) there exists a constant C > 0 such that |∇φε| ≤ C/ε,
(c) there exists a constant C > 0 such that the Lebesgue measure of the the support of

In particular, k∇φεkL1(R2) → 0 and k∇φεkL2(R2) is bounded as ε → 0.

∇φε is bounded by Cε2.

Proof. First we observe that

H ε(x) =

∇⊥ log |T ε(x)| =

∇⊥|T ε|(x),

1
2π|T ε(x)|

2π

and

∇φε = φ′(|T ε(x)|)∇|T ε|(x),

so that the ﬁrst assertion follows.

Next we compute

|∇φε(x)| ≤ C

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

by (2.3) and since DT ε(x) = (1/ε)DT (x/ε).

Finally, the support of ∇φε is included in the set {x ∈ Πε | 1 + a ≤ |T ε(x)| ≤ 2}. The

Lebesgue measure of this set can be estimated by:

Z1+a≤|T ε(x)|≤2

Z1+a≤|T (y)|≤2

dx =

ε2dy = Cε2.

We will use the cutoﬀ φε to uniformize the domains under consideration. All the functions
and vector ﬁelds deﬁned in Πε are hereafter to be extended arbitrarily to the full plane (for
instance by assigning zero value inside Ωε). We will only be working with these extensions
multiplied by φε, which makes the extension chosen irrelevant.

We require more detailed information on the asymptotic behavior of H ε than what was

provided by observation (3.7). This information is encoded in the following Lemma.
Lemma 4.2. Let H ≡ x⊥/2π|x|2 denote the basic harmonic vector ﬁeld on R2 \ {0} and
ﬁx R > 0. Then,

strongly in L1(B(0; R)) as ε → 0.

Proof. We estimate directly:

φεH ε → H,

|φεH ε − H|dx ≤

|φεH ε|dx

Z|x|≤R

ZΩε∪{|T ε(x)|≤2}

|H|dx ≡ I1 + I2 + I3.

15

We begin by noting that I3 → 0 as ε → 0 because the function |H| is locally integrable
and the Lebesgue measure of the set Ωε ∪ {|T ε(x)| ≤ 2} tends to zero, since it is contained
in a ball centered at the origin, with vanishing radius. Next we estimate I2:

|I2| ≤

Z1+a≤|T ε(x)|≤2

Z1+a≤|T (y)|≤2

|H ε|dx = ε

|HΠ(y)|dy,

which clearly vanishes as ε → 0. Above we have changed variables to y = x/ε and we used
the scaling of H ε from (3.6).

Lastly we address I1. We ﬁnd:

with ωε and vε bounded in L∞ and H ε bounded in L1

temporal information on velocity, which is more diﬃcult to obtain, because of the presence
of the pressure in the velocity equation. Obtaining such estimates is precisely the subject

16

of the article [4]. The speciﬁc case of the exterior domain was not discussed in that paper,
so we will adapt the technique used there to the present situation.

Recall the deﬁnition of the stream function (3.2) and introduce the analogous family of

stream functions given by ψε ≡ Gε[ωε].

Proposition 4.1. For each R, T > 0 there exists a constant C = C(R, T ) > 0 such that

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Proof. First we observe that there exists R > 0 such that ωε(·, t) has support contained in
the ball B(0; R) for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T and ε > 0. To see this, ﬁrst let R0 be such that B(0; R0)
contains the support of ω0 and note that equation (Eε) means that ωε is transported
by the velocity ﬁeld uε = vε + (α − m)H ε, with vε uniformly bounded by a constant C
independent of ε and t and H ε is bounded by another constant C, also independent of
ε, outside of B(0; R0). Hence the support of ωε(·, t) is contained in B(0, R0 + 2Ct), and
taking R = R0 + 2CT will work. Additionally, ωε
t is also compactly supported in the same
ball. We diﬀerentiate the deﬁnition of the stream function and write:

This means that

Finally, note that, by the deﬁnition of η, we ﬁnd that
∇⊥η = K ε[ϕ] + MH ε,

with M =

We write the conclusion of this Proposition more explicitly in terms of temporal estimates
for the quantities of interest in the Corollary below. Recall φε the cutoﬀ function from the
previous section and consider φεωε, φεvε and φεψε as functions (or vector ﬁelds) deﬁned in
the full plane.

5. Passing to the limit

In this section we will use the estimates developed in the previous section to obtain limit

equations describing the behavior of the ﬂow obtained in the limit ε → 0.

5.1. Strong compactness in velocity. We will use a parametrized version of Tartar and
Murat’s Div-Curl Lemma to derive strong compactness in L2 for the sequence of velocities
φεvε. We will include here the precise statement of this version of the Div-Curl Lemma,
whose proof can be found in [9].
Lemma 5.1. Fix T > 0 and let {F ε(·, t)} and {Gε(·, t)} be vector ﬁelds on Rn for 0 ≤
t ≤ T . Suppose that:
(a) both F ε → F and Gε → G weak-∗ in L∞([0, T ]; L2

loc(Rn; Rn)) and also strongly in

C([0, T ]; H −1

loc (Rn; Rn));
(b) {div F ε} is precompact in C([0, T ]; H −1
(c) {curl Gε} is precompact in C([0, T ]; H −1
Then F ε · Gε ⇀ F · G in D′([0, T ] × Rn).

loc(R2)). By Corollary 4.1, {(φεvε)t} is bounded in L∞([0, T ]; H −3

We will use the Div-Curl Lemma with F ε = Gε = φεvε. We begin by observing that
by Theorem 4.1 we know that {φεvε} is bounded in L∞([0, T ] × R2), which is contained
in L∞([0, T ]; L2
loc ), so that
the sequence {φεvε} is equicontinuous from [0, T ] to H −3
loc is compactly
embedded into H −3
loc , so that we can use the Aubin-Lions Lemma (see [14]) to conclude that
{φεvε} is precompact in C([0, T ]; H −1
loc ). Passing to a subsequence if necessary, we conclude
that there exists v ∈ C([0, T ]; H −1

loc([0, T ] × R2).

Proof. It is enough to verify the remaining hypothesis of the Div-Curl Lemma, i.e. that
div (φεvε) and curl (φεvε) are precompact in C([0, T ]; H −1
loc ). First note that, by Corollary
4.1, both (div (φεvε))t = div (φεvε)t and (curl (φεvε))t = curl (φεvε)t are bounded in
L∞([0, T ]; H −4

loc ). Also, we have that

div (φεvε) = vε · ∇φε,

which, by Lemma 4.1 and Theorem 4.1 is bounded in L∞([0, T ]; L2), and

curl (φεvε) = vε · ∇⊥φε + φεωε,
which, by Lemma 4.1, Theorem 4.1 and (4.1) is bounded in L∞([0, T ]; L2). Since L2 is
compactly embedded in H −1
loc , once again using the Aubin-Lions Lemma, we conclude that
both the divergence and the curl are precompact in C([0, T ]; H −1
loc ). By Lemma 5.1, we
infer that

|φεvε|2 ⇀ |v|2 in D′,

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

which in turn implies that φεvε converges strongly to v in L2

loc, as we wished.

5.2. The asymptotic vorticity equation. We begin by observing that the sequence
{φεωε} is bounded in L∞([0, T ] × R2), so that, passing to a subsequence if necessary, we
have that

φεωε ⇀ ω, weak ∗ L∞([0, T ] × R2).

We are already in possession of a limit velocity

u = v + (α − m)H,

where v is the strong limit of φεvε from the previous subsection and H is the strong limit
of φεH ε, introduced in Lemma 4.2. The purpose of this section is to prove that ω and u
satisfy, in an appropriate weak sense, the system:

ωt + u · ∇ω = 0,
div u = 0 and curl u = ω + (α − m)δ,
|u| → 0,
ω(x, 0) = ω0(x),

(b) we have div u = 0 and curl u = ω + (α − m)δ in the sense of distributions, with

|u| → 0 at inﬁnity.

When α = m the deﬁnition above reduces to the standard deﬁnition of weak solution
for the vorticity formulation of the incompressible 2D Euler equations. We now state and
prove the main result in this article.

Theorem 5.2. The pair (u, ω) given by (5.3) and (5.2) is a weak solution of the system
(5.4).

Proof. We will begin by verifying that (u, ω) satisfy the linear elliptic system corresponding
to the second condition in Deﬁnition 5.1. Recall that uε = vε + (α − m)H ε. First observe
that φεuε → u strongly in L1
loc, by Lemma 4.2 and Theorem 5.1. Hence, by Lemma 4.1
and Theorem 4.1,

div u = lim
ε→0

div (φεuε) = lim
ε→0

vε · ∇φε = 0,

21

where the limits were taken in the sense of distributions. Similarly, we use that φεvε → v
strongly in L2

loc, so that

curl v = lim
ε→0

curl (φεvε) = lim
ε→0

φεωε + vε · ∇⊥φε = ω,

in the sense of distributions. Hence,

curl u = curl v + (α − m)curl H = ω + (α − m)δ.

The velocity u satisﬁes the condition |u| → 0 at inﬁnity because the convergence of
φεuε to u is uniform outside a ball containing the origin, as can be checked directly by the
explicit expressions for K ε[ωε] and H ε, using the uniform compact support of ωε.

Next, we introduce an auxiliary nonlinear functional Iε. Given any test function ϕ ∈
c ([0, ∞) × R2) let:

For the second step we begin by noting that the linear term oﬀers no diﬃculty. The
nonlinear term consists of the weak-strong pair vorticity-velocity, with the vorticity φεωε
converging in the weak-∗ topology of L∞((0, ∞) × R2) to ω and the localized velocity
∇ϕ · (φεuε) converging in the strong topology of L1((0, ∞) × R2) to u. This concludes the
second step.

If α = m the whole sequence φεuε converges to u, without needing to pass to a sub-
sequence, due to the uniqueness portion of Yudovich’s Theorem, see [17].
Indeed, our
argument shows that for any sequence ωk → 0, there exists a subsequence ωkj such that
ωεkj ⇀ ω and that ω is a weak solution of 2D Euler in the full plane with ω0 as initial data.
By Yudovich’s Theorem, ω is uniquely determined, so that any accumulation point of the
precompact sequence ωεk is precisely equal to ω. This implies that the whole sequence ωεk
converges to ω, and, as this subsequence was arbitrary, our contention follows.

If α 6= m, Theorem 5.2 implies existence of a weak solution for the limit equation (5.4),
which is, roughly speaking, the usual Euler equation with an embedded point vortex back-
ground. Also, its restriction to R2 \ {0} is the standard Euler equation (see relation (5.8)).
The more physically meaningful presentation of the incompressible 2D Euler equations is
the velocity form. Clearly, if α = m, the limit ﬂow satisﬁes the usual velocity form of
the incompressible Euler equations, but if α 6= m it is not entirely clear what form the
asymptotic balance of momentum equations should take. We clarify this issue in the next
subsection.

5.3. The asymptotic velocity equation. We have obtained a satisfactory description
of the small obstacle limit expressed in terms of vortex dynamics. The purpose of this last
subsection is to obtain a description of the limit behavior expressed in terms of ﬂow velocity.
We will avoid introducing explicitly the weak forms of the velocity equation, keeping the
discussion less technical than before. More speciﬁcally, our purpose is to determine the
speciﬁc form of the momentum equations in the small obstacle asymptotics, in the case
α 6= m. The main diﬃculty is making sense of the term H ⊗ H. We will present several
equivalent forms for the limit equation (5.4). Recall that

First we note that (5.4) can be re-written as:

(5.5)

ωt + div(vω) + (α − m) div(Hω) = 0

v = K[ω]
ω(x, 0) = ω0(x)






which is clearly well deﬁned in the sense of distributions. This can be easily seen to be
equivalent to (5.4) since one has that div H = 0 and curl H = δ in the sense of D′(R2).
Writing (5.4) in this way will lead to a weak formulation for the velocity equation. More

H =

x⊥
2π|x|2 .

23



(5.6)

(5.7)

precisely, we next show that if (5.5) holds, then we have the following equation for v

vt + v · ∇v + (α − m) div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) − (α − m)v(0)⊥δ = ∇p

div v = 0

v(x, 0) = K[ω0].

In order to prove the equivalence of (5.5) and (5.6) it is suﬃcient to show that

div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) − v(0)⊥δ

= div(H curl v)

curl
(cid:2)

for all divergence free vector ﬁelds v belonging to the space W 1,p
if (5.7) holds then we get for ω = curl v

loc for some p > 2. Indeed,

(cid:3)

0 = curl ∇p = curl
(cid:2)
= curl(vt + v · ∇v) + (α − m) curl
= ωt + v · ∇ω + (α − m) div(Hω)

vt + v · ∇v + (α − m) div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) − (α − m)v(0)⊥δ

div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) − v(0)⊥δ
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

so relation (5.5) holds true. And vice versa, if (5.5) holds then we deduce that the left
hand side of (5.6) has zero curl so it must be a gradient.

We now prove (5.7) under the hypothesis that div v = 0 and v ∈ W 1,p

loc , p > 2. First note
that H curl v is well deﬁned since curl v ∈ Lp
loc for all q < 2. Moreover, since
W 1,p
loc ⊂ C0, v(0) is well deﬁned, too. Next, it suﬃces to prove (5.7) for smooth v since we
can pass to the limit on a sequence of smooth approximations of v that converge strongly
in W 1,p
loc and C0. Now, it is trivial to check that, for a 2 × 2 matrix A with coeﬃcients
distributions, the following identity holds

loc and H ∈ Lq

curl div A = div

curl C1
curl C2(cid:19)

(cid:18)

where Ci denotes the i-th column of A. For smooth v, we now deduce that

curl div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) = div

curl(vH1) + curl(Hv1)
curl(vH2) + curl(Hv2)(cid:19)
(cid:18)
H curl v + v · ∇⊥H + v curl H + H · ∇⊥v

= div

(cid:0)
It is a simple computation to check that

.

(cid:1)

div(v · ∇⊥H + H · ∇⊥v) = v · ∇⊥ div H + H · ∇⊥ div v + curl v div H + curl H div v.

We therefore get the following general formula

curl div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) = div(H curl v + v curl H) + v · ∇⊥ div H

+ H · ∇⊥ div v + curl v div H + curl H div v.

24

Taking into account that div v = div H = 0 and curl H = δ we infer that

curl div(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) = div(H curl v + vδ)

= div(H curl v) + div

v(0)δ
(cid:3)
(cid:2)
v(0)⊥δ
= div(H curl v) + curl
(cid:2)

.
(cid:3)

Relation (5.7) now follows and so does the formulation (5.6).

We would now like to give a formulation in terms of u only. Simply replacing v by
u − (α − m)H in (5.6) is not very enlightening. On the other hand, u is not L2
loc since
H 6∈ L2
loc. Therefore, a formulation which makes use of u ⊗ u cannot be made rigorous.
Nevertheless, it is still desirable to obtain such a formulation in order to clarify which form
the limit equation for the velocity takes.

We will proceed as follows. First note that

u ⊗ u = v ⊗ v + (α − m)(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) + (α − m)2H ⊗ H.

All these terms except H ⊗ H are well deﬁned. In order to give a sense to u ⊗ u up to 0 we
will simply extend H ⊗ H up to 0 by its ﬁnite part Pf(H ⊗ H) that we deﬁne as follows.

Deﬁnition 5.2. Let g be a function which is homogeneous of degree −2 and of class C∞
on R2 \ {0}. The ﬁnite part of g is the following distribution on R2:

Remark 5.1. This deﬁnition depends on the choice of the positive parameter λ that we ﬁx
once and for all.

We claim that if we extend u ⊗ u to a distribution of D′(R2) by

u ⊗ u = v ⊗ v + (α − m)(v ⊗ H + H ⊗ v) + (α − m)2 Pf(H ⊗ H)

then the limit velocity u veriﬁes the following PDE

ut + div(u ⊗ u) = −∇p + (α − m)v(0)⊥δ,

(5.8)

div u = 0

u(x, 0) = K[ω0] + (α − m)H.



This clearly follows from (5.6) if we are able to prove that div Pf(H ⊗ H) is a gradient. We
now show that curl div Pf(H ⊗ H) = 0 in D′(R2); this clearly implies that div Pf(H ⊗ H)
c (R2) be a test function. By deﬁnition

The results we have proved here are not very surprising after the nature of the harmonic
part of the ﬂow has been clariﬁed. In fact, a good illustration of the results obtained can
be explicitly computed if one considers the limit ﬂow associated to the motion of a single
point vortex in the exterior of a disk of vanishing radius. To be precise, consider the motion
of a single point vortex of strength m > 0 in the exterior of the disk B(0; r), r < 1, initially
located at (1, 0). Let Pr = Pr(t) denote the trajectory of this point vortex, which will
remain on the circle of radius 1 around the origin, moving with constant angular velocity.
At each ﬁxed time the velocity ﬁeld can be computed using the method of images as:

ur(x, t) =

m
2π

(x − Pr(t))⊥
|x − Pr(t)|2 −

m
2π

(x − r2Pr(t))⊥
|x − r2Pr(t)|2 +

α
2π

x⊥
|x|2 .

This ﬂow is equivalent to ﬂow in the full plane associated with three point vortices: the
original one at Pr(t), the image point vortex at r2Pr(t), with strength −m and a point

26

vortex of arbitrary strength α at the center of disk. The location of the image vortex is
the inversion, with respect to the disk of radius r, of the location of the original vortex.
The point vortex of arbitrary strength at the center is associated with the choice of the
harmonic part of the ﬂow. Curiously, when the method of images for ﬂow in the exterior
of a disk was discussed in [12], Saﬀman simply assumed that α = m was the correct choice
of harmonic part. In the case α = m, we have that

Pr(t) =

cos

(cid:18)

, − sin

mr2t

(cid:18)

2π(1 − r2) (cid:19)(cid:19)

,

so it is easy to verify that the angular velocity of Pr(t) vanishes as the radius of the disk
vanishes, so that Pr(t) converges pointwise in time to Pr(0) = (1, 0). Furthermore it can be
readily checked that the velocity ﬁelds ur converge to the velocity ﬁeld due to a single point
vortex in full plane ﬂow as r → 0 if and only if α = m. In short, what we accomplished
in this paper is to verify that the evanescent obstacle exterior ﬂow, for a general domain
geometry and general vorticity, behaves exactly like the corresponding limit of point vortex
ﬂow in the exterior of a vanishing disk.

Fig. 1 Curves Xr(Σ, T ) for T = 2 and r = 0; 0.025; 0.05; 0.1.

One interesting feature of the limit process in the case α = m is that, although both the
approximating and the limit ﬂows are smooth, the particle trajectories do not converge
uniformly. To see that, we use the illustration described above. Set m = 1 = α and let
Xr = Xr(Q, t) denote the particle trajectory under the ﬂow ur, starting at the Lagrangian

27

marker Q, and let X0 = X0(Q, t) denote the particle trajectory under the limit ﬂow. Let
Σ = {|x| = 1/4} and assume r < 1/4. Clearly, for any t > 0, Xr(Σ, t) and X0(Σ, t) are
smooth Jordan curves in the plane. It can be checked that there exists T > 0 such that
the origin lies outside X0(Σ, T ). Fix such a time T > 0. On one hand one expects to
have Xr(Σ, T ) converging to X0(Σ, T ) as r → 0. On the other hand, the origin lies in
the interior of Xr(Σ, T ) for all r > 0, as the ﬂow has to remain in the exterior of B(0; r),
see Figure 1. This means that the convergence as r → 0 of the maps Q 7→ Xr(Q, T ) to
the limit map X0(Q, T ) cannot be uniform, even in the compact parts of their common
domain.

Below we add two additional remarks concerning the results we have obtained.

(a) In the case γ = α − m 6= 0, one may ask why ﬁx the circulation γ around the small
obstacle, since this implies very large, maybe unphysical velocities at the boundary
of the obstacle, and not consider it some appropriate function of ε, perhaps vanishing
when ε → 0. In fact, γ plays the role of a passive parameter in the argument we
have presented, so there would be no change in the argument if we consider γ to be a
function of ε. The limit ﬂow would depend on γ(ε) only through its limit when ε → 0
in precisely the same manner as presented.

(b) For the sake of simplicity, we have presented our argument for smooth, compactly
supported initial vorticities, but the argument can be easily performed for compactly
supported vorticities in Lp, p > 2. The argument does not work for p ≤ 2 because
there are serious diﬃculties in making sense of the term Hω in that case, and the
value v(0), which appears in the limit velocity (5.8), also becomes ambiguous. The
case p ≤ 2 is thus an interesting open problem.

Let us point out some of the natural questions raised by the research presented here.
First, an analogous question can be asked with regard to the 2D incompressible Navier-
Stokes equations, and this is the subject of current investigation by the authors. For
incompressible 3D Euler, the problem initially becomes proving that a smooth solution
exists for a time that is independent of the size of the domain, something we did not
investigate, but that appears to be diﬃcult. Of course, the most interesting situation is
the same limit for 3D Navier-Stokes, but it makes sense to work out the 2D equations ﬁrst.
Once the viscous problem has been understood, one may ask about the interaction of the
small obstacle and small viscosity limits, which in two dimensions is a simpliﬁcation of
the classical open problem of convergence of Navier-Stokes solutions to Euler solutions in
the presence of boundaries, see [15] for an account of the state-of-the-art of this problem.
Another natural question is to understand the same limit with more than one obstacle,
with perhaps only some of the obstacles vanishing. Finally, it would be interesting to
obtain a description of the leading order correction associated to the evanescent obstacle,
in the case α = m, with respect to the unperturbed full plane problem.

Abstract. We study generation of magnetic ﬁelds involving large spatial
scales by time- and space-periodic short-scale parity-invariant ﬂows. The
anisotropic magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor is calculated by the standard
procedure involving expansion of magnetic modes and their growth rates in
power series in the scale ratio. Our simulations, conducted for ﬂows with
random harmonic composition and exponentially decaying energy spectra,
demonstrate that for a substantial part of time-periodic ﬂows magnetic eddy
diﬀusivity is negative for molecular diﬀusivity above the instability threshold
for short-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation. Thus, like it was in the case of
steady ﬂows, enlargement of the spatial scale of magnetic ﬁeld is shown to
be beneﬁcial for generation by time-periodic ﬂows. However, they are less
eﬃcient dynamos, than steady ﬂows.

Key words. Kinematic magnetic dynamo, slow dynamo, time-periodic
ﬂow, asymptotic expansion, Floquet problem, magnetic modes, magnetic
eddy diﬀusivity.

The present work is a direct continuation of the studies conducted by
Lanotte et al. (2000) and Zheligovsky et al. (2001), who found steady parity-
invariant ﬂows with a negative magnetic eddy diﬀusivity to be quite common.
A similar investigation for turbulent ﬂows is desirable, especially given that
ﬂows in experimental dynamos are necessarily turbulent (see discussion in
Zheligovsky et al. , 2001). However, dynamo simulations with such ﬂows are
numerically demanding. We consider here an “intermediate” class of ﬂows –
those periodic in time, and employ for simulations the simplest ﬂows of this
kind:

v(x, t) = U(x) + √ω(Vc(x) cos ωt + Vs(x) sin ωt).

(1)

Like in the cited papers, a ﬂow is supposed to be 2π-periodic in spatial
variables x and parity-invariant, i.e.

v(x, t) =

v(

x, t).

Two families of space- and time-periodic ﬂows were closely examined in
the context of fast kinematic magnetic dynamo theory. Both are generaliza-
tions of ABC ﬂows. A ﬂow of the kind of “modulated waves”, proposed by
Otani (1993) and studied also by Childress & Gilbert (1995), belongs to the
class (1). “Circularly polarized” ﬂows were employed in simulations by Gal-
loway & Proctor (1992) and Galloway & O’Brian (1993); for near-integrable
ﬂows of this kind analytical results were presented by Ponty et al. (1993,
1995) and Childress & Gilbert (1995). The assumed time dependence was
responsible for chaotic behavior of the ﬂow trajectories (this is necessary for a
dynamo to be fast), though the ﬂows depended only on two spatial variables
(for steady ﬂows this rules out emergence of chaos). This gave opportu-
nity to separate out dependence on the third spatial coordinate and to make
104
convincing computations for high magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm ∼
(Galloway & Proctor, 1992; Galloway & O’Brian, 1993). A generalization
of this kind (circular polarization) of non-integrable three-dimensional ABC
ﬂows was considered by Brummell et al. (1999).

In Section 1 we present a mathematical statement of the problem and
state results of calculation of the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor (a detailed
derivation can be found in Appendix). Dependencies of the minimal mag-
netic diﬀusivity on the ratio of energies of the steady and time-dependent
parts of the ﬂow and on the temporal frequency ω are studied numerically.
Flows with random harmonic composition and exponentially decaying en-
ergy spectra are considered. Results of simulations are discussed in Section
2. In general, steady ﬂows are found to be more capable of magnetic ﬁeld
generation, than time-periodic ones. Owing to the factor √ω in (1), in the
high temporal frequency limit the time-dependent part of the ﬂow provides
a ﬁnite contribution to the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor. In Section 3 the
limit of the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor is calculated, and it is shown
that ﬂows can have negative eddy diﬀusivity for ω

1. Magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor for time-periodic ﬂows

In this Section we consider a kinematic dynamo problem for a ﬂow v(x, t)
of time period T , which is 2π-periodic in each Cartesian variable in space,
solenoidal (

v = 0) and parity-invariant (2).

Temporal evolution of a magnetic ﬁeld h is described by the magnetic

satisﬁes

i.e. the kinematic dynamo problem reduces to the Floquet problem for the
magnetic induction operator. The modes H(x, t) are assumed to be solenoidal:

H = 0,

∇ ·

and to have the same time period T , as the ﬂow. Reλ is then the average
rate of growth (or decay) of the mode in time.

We consider magnetic modes, involving large spatial scales. The modes
are supposed to depend on the fast spatial variable x and on the slow variable
y = ǫx. By the chain rule, spatial derivatives in the eigenmode equation (4)
and the solenoidality condition (5) must be modiﬁed:

∇ → ∇

x + ǫ

y

∇

(the subscripts x and y refer to diﬀerentiation in fast and slow variables,
respectively). The ratio of the two scales, ǫ > 0, is a small parameter of the
problem.

Solution to the Floquet problem (4) is sought in the form of power series

Xn=0

Substituting (6) and the series (7) and (8) into (4), expanding and equating
coeﬃcients for each power of ǫ, one obtains a hierarchy of equations. It is
discussed in Appendix, how all terms of (7) and (8) can be determined by a
systematic procedure. In particular, it is shown that:

The leading term in (7) is λ2 and the expansion involves terms with even

indices only (λ0 = λ2n+1 = 0 for any integer n

0).

x, y, t) = ˜H2n(x, y, t) for any integer n

All terms of (8) with even indices are parity anti-invariant in fast variables
0), and all terms with odd

2. Magnetic eddy diﬀusivity for ﬂows (1): numerical results

Numerical simulations have been carried out for ﬂows (1), where U, Vc
and Vs are 2π-periodic parity-invariant solenoidal ﬁelds. The ﬁelds are gen-
erated by the procedure, which was applied by Zheligovsky et al. (2001): (i)
a half of Fourier harmonics with uniformly randomly distributed components
is generated (all the rest are obtained by complex conjugation, so that the
vector ﬁeld is real), (ii) the gradient part of the resultant ﬁeld is projected
out, and (iii) harmonics are rescaled in each Fourier spherical shell to obtain
the desirable energy spectrum. The spectrum of ﬂows employed in our sim-
ulations exponentially decreases by 6 orders of magnitude, and the Fourier
series is cut oﬀ at wavenumber 10. The vector ﬁelds are normalized so that

Etotal = 1,

Solutions to the auxiliary problems (10) and (11) are sought in the form
of Fourier series, with the 643 Fourier harmonics resolution in space and 8
harmonics resolution in time. For such resolution the spatial energy spectra
of the solutions decay by at least 10 orders of magnitude, and the temporal
ones – by 4-5 orders of magnitude.

All computations presented in this paper are made for molecular magnetic
diﬀusivity η = 0.1 .
It has been veriﬁed that for each sample ﬂow (1),
for which a magnetic eddy diﬀusivity value is reported here, the real part
of the dominant eigenvalue of the magnetic induction operator acting in
the space of 2π-periodic short-scale (i.e. independent of the slow variables)
zero-mean magnetic ﬁelds is negative, i.e. η = 0.1 is above the magnetic
diﬀusivity threshold for the onset of generation of a short-scale magnetic
ﬁeld. Algorithms of Zheligovsky (1993) are applied for numerical treatment
of the eigenvalue problems.

Three kinds of numerical experiments have been conducted.

a) We study how minimal magnetic eddy diﬀusivity ηeddy behaves when the
ﬂow (1) is close to a steady one. Magnetic eddy diﬀusivity has been eval-
uated for temporal frequency ω = 1 and molecular viscosity η = 0.1 for 30
independent samples of (1) satisfying (14) and (15), such that the ratio of
the average energy of the time-dependent part of (1),

Eosc =

2dx = 1/400.

A histogram of the values of δηeddy, the amount of change in magnetic eddy
diﬀusivity due to introduction of this time periodicity into the ﬂow, is shown
on Fig. 1. Only in 2 cases out of 30 the moderate time dependence makes
ηeddy to decrease.

b) We examine dependence of minimal magnetic eddy diﬀusivity on distri-
bution of kinetic energy between the time-dependent and steady parts of the
ﬂow. Magnetic eddy diﬀusivity is evaluated for three sets of sample ﬂows
(1) for ω = 1. Proﬁles of the constituting ﬁelds U, Vc and Vs are the same
as in some three samples shown on Fig. 1; in each set, their amplitudes are
varied ( (14) and (15) remaining satisﬁed).

Graphs of ηeddy versus the ratio Eosc/Etotal are plotted on Fig. 2. Despite
a signiﬁcant variation of details of graphs representing diﬀerent ﬂows, Fig. 2
reveals a common tendency: a relative increase of the energy contained in
the time-dependent part of the ﬂow is in general accompanied by an overall
(although not necessarily monotonous) increase of magnetic eddy diﬀusivity.
Though time periodicity may be expected to enhance chaotic properties
of ﬂows (which are necessary for fast dynamo action), these results suggest
that the periodicity of the ﬂow, at least such as (1), is not favorable for
generation of magnetic ﬁeld. However, dynamos considered here are slow,
and therefore this is not a formal contradiction.

c) We study dependence of magnetic eddy diﬀusivity on temporal frequency
of the ﬂow (see Fig. 3). Computations are done for the ﬂow from the set,
represented by the lowest curve on Fig. 2; for this ﬂow ηeddy is close to the
minimum over the considered set of sample ﬂows. For large ω magnetic eddy
diﬀusivity is found to increase together with the temporal frequency, and it
has a ﬁnite limit when ω

The limit values of Dm,k are not aﬀected by phase shifts: (20) and (21)

Therefore, if ImV = 0, then in the limit ω
a contribution from the
time-periodic part of the ﬂow (16) vanishes. Combined together, these two
observations imply that a non-zero contribution from the time-periodic part
of (16) requires linear independence of vector ﬁelds Vc and Vs.

The same value of molecular viscosity η = 0.1 was employed in simula-
tions. Short-scale magnetic ﬁeld growth rates can be analyzed in the limit
ω
similarly to the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor: Fourier compo-
nents of short-scale magnetic modes can be expanded in the power series
in ω−1/2 and exhibit the same asymptotical behavior, as solutions to the
auxiliary problems. The limit short-scale magnetic modes turn out to be
eigenfunctions of the linear operator at the left-hand side of (20) and (21).
It has been veriﬁed that for each sample ﬂow (1), for which a limit magnetic
eddy diﬀusivity value is reported here, the limit magnetic induction operator
acting in the space of 2π-periodic short-scale zero-mean magnetic ﬁelds has
no eigenvalues with a positive real part, i.e. for the employed ﬂows η = 0.1 is
above the threshold for the onset of generation of short-scale magnetic ﬁelds
in the limit of high temporal frequencies.

We conducted two kinds of numerical experiments consisting of evaluation
of the limit magnetic eddy diﬀusivity, involving solution of the problems (20)
and (21).

a) Limit values of magnetic eddy diﬀusivities were computed for the same
three sets of sample ﬂows (1) (see Fig. 4), for which dependence of minimal
magnetic eddy diﬀusivity on the distribution of kinetic energy between the
time-dependent and steady parts of the ﬂow has been studied in Section
2 for ω = 1.
(Curves associated with the same sets of sample ﬂows on
Figs. 2 and 4 can be related considering the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity values
for steady ﬂows, represented by left-most points on the graphs.) For each
set, computations were done for the same values of the ratio Eosc/Etotal,
as for ω = 1. It can be observed that like in the case of ﬁnite frequency,
studied in Section 2, a relative increase of the energy contained in the time-
dependent part of the ﬂow in general implies a certain increase of magnetic
eddy diﬀusivity. However, the inﬂuence of time-dependent parts of ﬂows has
now signiﬁcantly decreased.

Conclusion

Generation of magnetic ﬁeld involving large spatial scales by time- and
space-periodic short-scale parity-invariant ﬂows has been studied. The aniso-
tropic magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor has been calculated. A complete ex-
pansion of magnetic modes and their growth rates in power series in the scale
ratio has been constructed for ﬂows (1). Simulations have been conducted
for ﬂows (1) with random harmonic composition and exponentially decaying
energy spectra. Flows giving rise to negative magnetic eddy diﬀusivity have
been detected, for molecular diﬀusivity above the instability threshold for
short-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation. Numerical results demonstrate that
in general transition from steady to time-periodic ﬂows makes generation of
large-scale magnetic ﬁeld less eﬃcient; high temporal frequencies are also un-
favorable for generation. Nevertheless, we have found numerically instances
of ﬂows (1) lacking the steady component, for which magnetic eddy diﬀusivity
is negative for ω

Appendix. Formal asymptotic decomposition of magnetic modes
and of their growth rates for time-periodic ﬂows (1)

We derive complete asymptotic expansions of a magnetic mode and its

growthrate for the ﬂow (1), which it is convenient to express here as

v(x, t) = U(x) + W(x)eiωt + W(x)e−iωt,

where the notation

W = √ωV

is used. Our derivation follows that of Zheligovsky et al. (2001) for steady
ﬂows.

A magnetic mode H(x, y, t) is a solenoidal (5) solution to the Floquet

T -periodic in time and 2π-periodic in space, such that
the problem
F = f has a unique short-scale solenoidal solution with a van-
ishing spatial mean, which has the same time and space periodicities, as the
ﬂow. (Equivalently, the magnetic induction operator
is assumed to have a
trivial kernel.) Generically this condition holds.

by omitting in (A28) all terms, involving H0,N or derivatives of H0,N −1, and
changing G·,N to Q·,N .

Thus a complete asymptotic expansion of magnetic modes and their
growthrates is constructed. Like in the case of a stationary velocity, it can

(A29)

= λ2, and not that

(For this reason for constructions of section iv it was suﬃcient to demand
that λ′
λ2 is invertible in the whole domain.) This
stems from the fact that for the velocity (A1) the domain of the magnetic
induction operator splits into invariant subspaces, each comprised of vector
ﬁelds (A29) and categorized by wavevectors q.

M −

Analyzing parity of solutions of the hierarchy of equations (A8) con-
structed in this Appendix, one ﬁnds that all Gj,n with even indices n are par-
ity anti-invariant; all Gj,n with odd indices n are parity-invariant;
= 0
for any odd n; and λn = 0 for any odd n.

Abstract

We study the deformation and motion of an erythrocyte in ﬂuid ﬂows via a lattice Boltzmann method.

To this purpose, the bending rigidity and in-plane elasticity potentials are introduced and incorporated with

the lattice Boltzmann simulation, and the membrane-ﬂow interactions on both sides of the membrane are

carefully examined. We ﬁnd that the biconcave shape of the erythrocyte is quite stable and can effectively

resist the external perturbations on their membrane. In shear ﬂow with a mild shear rate, erythrocytes keep

their biconcave shapes and perform tank tread-like motion with the angle velocity linearly proportional to

the shear rate. Because of its intrinsically parallel dynamics, this lattice Boltzmann method is expected to

ﬁnd wide applications for both single and multi-vesicles suspension as well as complex open membranes in

various ﬂuid ﬂows for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

Vesicle whose membrane consists of lipid bilayer is essential to the function of biological

systems [1]. Erythrocyte is the most important kind of vesicles. In the past 30 years, the dynamics

of vesicle has received particular attention [2, 3, 4, 5]. It has been recognized that the equilibrium

shape can be obtained by minimizing the bending energy of the membrane [2]. However, the

studies on the unsteady states lag behind, mainly because of the numerical difﬁculty on both

keeping the vesicle membrane inextensible and capturing the coupling between the membrane

and ambient ﬂuids while the vesicle is deforming and moving under the hydrodynamic forces

exerted on both sides of its elastic membrane [3]. When the vesicle is very close to a solid static

boundary and the Reynolds number is very small, lubrication theory has been extended to the

study [4]. Recently, the deformations of the vesicles in the approximation of Stokes ﬂow has been

extensively studied by the boundary integral and singularity methods [3, 5].

Erythrocytes in large blood vessels, which have larger Reynolds numbers, not only affect the

viscosity of the ﬂuid [6], but also often subject to pathological changes of their membranes due to

the large shear stress [7]. This calls for computing models for deformations of vesicles, particularly

with inhomogeneous membrane, in ﬂuid ﬂow with a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Moreover,

considering the numerical complexity of the vesicle deformations and multi-vesicle suspensions,

and the recent development of computational technique, especially on the PC clusters and internet

grid computing, it is most desirable that the numerical models are intrinsically parallel. The lattice

Boltzmann method has localized kinetic nature which is not only intrinsically parallel but also

easy to capture the interaction between a ﬂuid and a small segment of a deformable boundary.

In the past ﬁfteen years, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) [8, 9] has been recognized as an

alternate method for computational ﬂuid dynamics, especially in the areas of complex ﬂuids such

as particle suspension ﬂow [10], binary mixture [11] and blood ﬂow [12]. Very recently we have

proposed an approach on the boundary condition for moving boundaries together with a method to

calculate the hydrodynamic force on a solid surface [13]. The accuracy has been demonstrated by

the numerical calculations of the hydrodynamic forces on small segments of an inclined boundary,

an arc, and simulations of sedimentation of a solid circular cylinder and a particle migrating in

Poiseuille ﬂow [13].

Based on this scheme, in this Letter a LBM model is proposed to simulate two-dimensional

vesicle deforming and moving in ﬂuid ﬂows. To this purpose, we introduce the bending rigidity

to characterize the elastic properties of vesicle membrane, an in-plane elasticity potential to make

the membrane nearly inextensible, and both of them are incorporated with LBM simulations in a

2

discrete form. Moreover, the membrane-ﬂow interactions on both sides are carefully examined.

The numerical simulation results on the shapes of erythrocytes under different chemical potential

drops agree with those from a shooting method [14] excellently well. Importantly, simulations

on the erythrocytes with nonuniform membranes show that the biconcave shapes can effectively

resist the perturbations on the properties of the erythrocyte membrane. Erythrocytes maintain

their biconcave shapes and undergo tank tread-like motion in shear ﬂow with small and mild shear

rate. This model is particularly useful in parallel computation on the simulations for multi-vesicles

suspension as well as complex membranes in various ﬂuid ﬂows.

We choose to work with the D2Q9 model on a two-dimensional square lattice with nine ve-
locities [9]. Let fα(x, t) be the non-negative distribution function which can be thought as the
number of ﬂuid particles at site x, time t, and possessing a velocity of eα. Here e0 = (0, 0), eα =

The membrane of the erythrocytes has bending rigidity potential, which can be written as [2, 5]

where kB is the bending modulus, k and l are the curvature and the arc length of the membrane,

separately. Biomembranes are formed by a lipid bilayer, which is viscoelastic. The erythrocyte

viscoelasticity is usually assumed to be Kelvin-Voigt [15] and described by

Tmn = 2η ˙εmn,

(4)

where Tmn is the viscous stress, ˙εmn and η are the strain rate and the viscous coefﬁcient of the

membrane. The viscoelasticity of the membrane does not change the steady shapes of erythrocytes.

Numerically, the membrane of a two-dimensional erythrocyte is discretized into equilength

segments. We implement a no-slip boundary condition and compute the hydrodynamic forces on

both sides of each segment according to the scheme we proposed recently [13]. The inextensibility

of the membrane can be approximated by adopting an in-plane potential φk between neighboring

segments as

where kk is the elastic coefﬁcient of the membrane, l0 and li are the original and simulated length of

segment i respectively. Due to the inextensibility, only the forces on the normal direction from the

bending energy by Eq. (3) and the viscoelasticity by Eq. (4) are considered. In this approximation,

Pozrikidis has already shown that the transverse shear tension due to the bending energy can be

computed as [5]

The force exerted on segment i due to the bending energy is

where ki+1 and ki are the curvatures of the membrane at segments i + 1 and i, respectively. The

membrane viscous resistance on the normal direction on segment i is

where vi+1,n and vi,n is the velocity of segments i + 1 and i along the normal direction of segment

i, separately.

The translation of each segment is updated at each Newtonian dynamics time step according to

the sum of all the forces on the segment by using a so-called half-step ‘leap-frog’ scheme [16].

here to be serum too, but can be different from the serum outside without adding any complexity

to the calculation. The thickness and the density of the membrane are set to be 0.02 µm and 1.00

is set to the human body temperature 37o C. The radius of an erythrocyte without any chemical

potential drop from outer to inner is assumed to be 3 µ m [5], comparable to that for a human

erythrocyte. We choose kk = 8000 dyn/cm so that the extensibility of the membrane is negligible.

The simulation domain consists of 80

80 lattice units. Initially, the ﬂuid was homogeneous and

×

static. A circular membrane placed at the center of the square without stretching was discretized

into N = 100 segments. The radius of the initial circular membrane was 20 lattice units so that the

length in each lattice unit corresponded to 0.15 µm. The relaxation time τ was ﬁxed to be 0.75,
10−9 s for each time step. The initial density of the ﬂuid inside and outside the

resulting in 1.87

close membrane was set to be one lattice Boltzmann unit. The other non-dimensional quantities

relevant to lattice Boltzmann simulations could be computed correspondingly. In the simulation,

the ﬂuid in the square of 6

6 lattice units at the center of the system was pumped out with a
10−8 g/s, i.e., 1/1000 per time-step, until the predetermined chemical potential

drop was reached, the inner density then remained constant for the remainder of the simulation.

Fig. 1 shows the proﬁles of an erythrocyte with different chemical potential drops ∆µ together

with that of a shooting method [14]. As ∆µ increases, the erythrocyte deforms from a circle to an

ellipse, and into an biconcave shape. Excellent agreement can be found between the two methods.

In order to further characterize the agreement, we have also computed the relative global error σ

Due to high values of shear stress in the large arteries or in cases of oxidant injury [7], ery-

throcyte membranes can be pathologically damaged so that the bending rigidity modulus becomes

non-uniform. To study the effect on the shapes of the erythrocytes, we performed numerical sim-

ulations with bending modulus changing periodically along the membrane

where δ is a constant, l′ is the normalized arc length of the membrane, and n is an integer. The

simulation results for δ = 0.1 are shown in Fig. 2. For small chemical potential drop, say ∆µ

≤
0.090 J/mol, the shape of the erythrocyte exhibits the same symmetry of KB. Remarkably, when

∆µ is large enough, all erythrocytes, with different bending modulus, become biconcave shapes,

i.e., the biconcave shapes can effectively resist the perturbations. We note that the perturbations are

quite large as the minimum of KB is only 10% of its original value. Further, erythrocyte proﬁles

for perturbation wave numbers of the same parity are very similar to each other. As shown in Fig. 2

(b), the difference between the proﬁles for n = 3 and n = 5, or that between n = 2 and n = 4 is

almost indistinguishable whereas the discrepancy between the cases of n = 2 and n = 3 is clear.

When the wave number n is large enough, the difference for odd and even n becomes very small

as shown in Fig. 2 (c). The chemical potential drop needed to collapse an erythrocyte is smaller

for an even n than that for an odd n, this difference becomes vanishingly small as n increases.

Finally, we performed simulations of an erythrocyte moving in shear ﬂow. The shear ﬂow is

produced by making the upper boundary move rightward and the lower boundary move leftward

with a same velocity. ∆µ is ﬁxed to be 0.806 J/mol. Erythrocytes undergo tank tread-like mo-

tion, consistent with the famous experimental observation by Fischer, St¨ohr-Liesen, and Schmidt-

Sch¨onbein [19]. The shear rate γ dose not inﬂuence the angle between the axis of symmetry of

It is clear that the simulation result has the same linear behaviour and comparable value of the ex-

perimental data. Considering that our simulation is performed in two dimensions, the agreement

is quite satisfactory.

To summaries, we have developed a lattice Boltzmann model to simulate two-dimensional

vesicle deforming and moving in various ﬂuid ﬂows for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. Nu-

merical simulations show that the biconcave shape can effectively resist external perturbations on

the membranes. In shear ﬂows with small and mild shear rate, erythrocytes keep their biconcave

shapes and undergo tank tread-like motion. Considering that the biconcave shape of an erythro-

cyte plays the critical role in the transport of oxygen [20] and other physiological functions [21],

this observation could have clinical applications that erythrocytes can retain their physiological

activities even in a poor condition, which might be one of the reasons why erythrocytes have bi-

concave shapes. The observation also suggests that, contrary to intuition, the abnormal shapes of

erythrocytes observed usually indicate the pathological changes of other factors of erythrocytes

rather than their membranes. The method developed in this Letter should ﬁnd more applications

in studying the behaviour of multi-vesicle suspension and complex membranes in various ﬂuid

ﬂows.

Abstract

Fundamental aspects of inverse kinetic theories for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations con-

cern the possibility of deﬁning uniquely the kinetic equation underlying such models and further-

more, the construction of a kinetic theory implying also the energy equation. The latter condition

is consistent with the requirement that ﬂuid ﬁelds result classical solutions of the ﬂuid equations.

These issues appear of potential relevance both from the mathematical viewpoint and for the phys-

ical interpretation of the theory. In this paper we intend to prove that the non-uniqueness feature

can be resolved by imposing suitable assumptions. These include, in particular, the requirement

that the kinetic equation be equivalent, in a suitable sense, to a Fokker-Planck kinetic equation.

Its Fokker-Planck coeﬃcients are proven to be uniquely determined by means of appropriate pre-

scriptions. In addition, as a further result, it is proven that the inverse kinetic equation satisﬁes

both an entropy principle and the energy equation for the ﬂuid ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION

An aspect of ﬂuid dynamics is represented by the class of so-called inverse problems, in-

volving the search of model kinetic theories able to yield a prescribed set of ﬂuid equations,

with particular reference to the continuity and Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations for Newtonian

ﬂuids, by means of suitable velocity-moments of an appropriate kinetic distribution func-

tion f (r, v,t). Among such model theories, special relevance pertains to those describing,

self-consistently, isothermal incompressible ﬂuids described by the so-called incompressible

Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) in the sense that the ﬂuid equations are satisﬁed for arbi-

trary ﬂuid ﬁelds and for arbitrary initial conditions for the kinetic distribution. In particular

the ﬂuid ﬁelds are in this case identiﬁed with {ρ ≡ ρo, V,p} ,being Vthe ﬂuid velocity and,

ρand prespectively, the mass density and ﬂuid pressure, both non-negative in the closure (Ω)
of the ﬂuid domain Ω ⊆ R3,while ρis always constant (condition of incompressibility). A

desirable feature of the theory is, however, the requirement that the relevant inverse kinetic

equation are uniquely deﬁned (in particular, by imposing that a particular solution is pro-

vided by local Maxwellian equilibria) as well as the possibility of requiring, besides INSE, also

additional ﬂuid equations, to be satisﬁed by means of suitable moment equations (extended

INSE ). An example is provided by the energy equation, i.e., the ﬂuid equation obtained by

taking the scalar product of the Navier-Stokes equation by the ﬂuid velocity V

where f is the volume force density acting on the ﬂuid element. In fact, it is well known that

the energy equation is not satisﬁed by weak solutions of INSE and, as a consequence, also

by certain numerical solutions, such as those based on weak solutions such as possibly so-

called ﬁnite-volume schemes. Therefore, imposing its validity for the inverse kinetic equation

yields is a necessary condition for the validity of classical solutions for INSE. In a previous

work [1, 2, 3], an explicit solution to INSE has been discovered based on a continuous

inverse kinetic theory, adopting a ”Vlasov ” diﬀerential kinetic equation deﬁned by a suitable

streaming operator L. Basic feature of this kinetic equation is that, besides yielding INSE

as moment equations, it allows, as particular solutions, local kinetic equilibria for arbitrary

(but suitably smooth) ﬂuid ﬂuids {ρo, V,p} . However, as pointed out in Refs.[3, 4], the

inverse kinetic equation deﬁned in this way results parameter-dependent and hence non-

unique, even in the case of local Maxwellian kinetic equilibria. This non-uniqueness feature

2

may result as a potentially undesirable feature of the mathematical model, since it prevents

the possible physical interpretation of the theory (in particular, of the mean-ﬁeld force F)

and may result inconvenient from the mathematical viewpoint since the free parameter may

be chosen, for example, arbitrarily large in magnitude. It is therefore highly desirable to to

eliminate it from the theory [4].

The purpose of this paper is to present a reformulation of the problem which permits to

cast the inverse kinetic equation in a form which results unique, thus eliminating possible

parameter-dependences in the relevant streaming operator. Actually, the prescription of

uniqueness on the kinetic equation is to be intended in the a suitably meaningful, i.e., to

hold under the requirement that the relevant set of ﬂuid equations are fulﬁlled identically

by the ﬂuid ﬁelds in the extended domain Ω × I. This means that arbitrary contributions in

the kinetic equation, which vanish identically under a such an hypothesis, can be included

in the same kinetic equation. Consistent with the previous regularity assumption, here we

intend to consider, in particular, the requirement that the inverse kinetic equation yields

also the energy equation (1). Note that this new formulation of the inverse kinetic theory is

also relevant for comparisons both with previous literature dealing with the determination of

the probability distribution function (PDF) for incompressible ﬂuids [5] and with emerging

theoretical approaches for the determination of the PDF for small scale turbulence to model

homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in the inertial range. As further development of the

theory, it is shown that the streaming operator can be suitably and uniquely modiﬁed in such

a way that the inverse kinetic equation yields the extended INSE equations, i.e., besides the

incompressible Navier-Stokes equations also the energy equation. In particular we intend to

prove that the mean-ﬁeld force F can be uniquely deﬁned in such a way that both kinetic

equilibrium and moment equations yield uniquely such equations.

II. NON-UNIQUENESS OF THE STREAMING OPERATOR

We start recalling that the inverse kinetic equation which is assumed of the form

L(F)f = 0

In particular, the streaming operator L is assumed to be realized by a diﬀerential

[3].
operator of the form L(F) = ∂

∂v · {F} . The vector ﬁeld F (mean-ﬁeld force) can

3

be assumed of the form F ≡ F0 + F1, where F0 and F1, requiring in particular that they

depend on the minimal number of velocity moments [4], can be deﬁned as follows

F0(x,t; f ) =

pendent on the kinetic distribution function f (x,t). Supplemented with suitable initial and

boundary conditions and subject to suitable smoothness assumptions for the kinetic distri-

bution function f (x,t), several important consequences follow [3]:

• the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρo, V,p} can be identiﬁed in the whole ﬂuid domain Ω with suit-

able velocity moments (which are assumed to exist) of the kinetic distribution func-

G(x, t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1

f (x,t)], of the form MG(r, t) =

d3vG(x, t)f (x,t), where
3 u2, vE, uu, and u ≡ v − V(r,t) is the relative velocity. Thus, we
d3vvf (x,t), p(r,t) = p1(r,t) − Po
3 f (x,t).Requiring,
∇p(r,t) = ∇p1(r,t) and p1(r,t) strictly positive, it follows that Po is an arbitrary

strictly positive function of time, to be deﬁned so that the physical realizability con-
dition p(r,t) ≥ 0 is satisﬁed everywhere in Ω × I (I ⊆ R being generally a ﬁnite time

interval);

• {ρo, V,p} are advanced in time by means of the inverse kinetic equation Eq.(2);

• By appropriate choice of the mean-ﬁeld force F, the moment equations can be proven

to satisfy identically INSE, and in particular the Poisson equation for the ﬂuid pressure,

as well the appropriate initial and boundary conditions (see Ref.[3]);

• The mean-ﬁeld force F results by construction function only of the velocity moments

ρo, V,p1, Q,Π

, to be denoted as extended ﬂuid ﬁelds.

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

• In particular, L(F) can be deﬁned in such a way to allow that the inverse ki-

netic equation (2) admits, as a particular solution, the local Maxwellian distribution

Let us now prove that the inverse kinetic equation deﬁned above (2) is non-unique, even

in the particular case of local Maxwellian kinetic equilibria, due to the non-uniqueness in

the deﬁnition of the mean-ﬁeld force F and the streaming operator L(F). In fact, let us

introduce the parameter-dependent vector ﬁeld F(α)

F(α) = F + αu · ∇V−α∇V · u ≡ F0(α) + F1

(5)

where F ≡ F(α = 0), α ∈ R is arbitrary and we have denoted

F0(α) = F0 − α∆F0 ≡ F0a + ∆1F0(α),

∆F0 ≡ u · ∇V−∇V · u,

(6)

∆1F0(α) ≡ (1 + α)u · ∇V − α∇V · u,

where F0 and F1 given by Eqs.(3),(4). Furthermore, here we have introduced also the

quantity ∆1F0(α) to denote the parameter-dependent part of F0(α). In fact, it is immediate

to prove the following elementary results:

a) for arbitrary α ∈ R, the local Maxwellian distribution fM is a particular solution of

the inverse kinetic equation (2) if and only if the incompressible N-S equations are satisﬁed;
b) for arbitrary α in R, the moment equations stemming from the kinetic equation (2)

coincide with the incompressible N-S equations;

c) the parameter α results manifestly functionally independent of the kinetic distribution

function f (x, t).

The obvious consequence is that the functional form of the vector ﬁeld F0, and conse-

quently F, which characterizes the inverse kinetic equation (2) is not unique. The non-

uniqueness in the contribution F0(α) is carried by the term α∆F0 which does not vanish

even if the ﬂuid ﬁelds are required to satisfy identically INSE in the set Ω × I. We intend

to show in the sequel that the value of the parameter α can actually be uniquely deﬁned by

a suitable prescription on the streaming operator and the related mean-ﬁeld force.

III. A UNIQUE REPRESENTATION

To resolve the non-uniqueness feature of the functional form of the streaming operator L,

due to this parameter dependence, let us now consider again the inverse kinetic equation (2).

We intend to prove that the mean-ﬁeld force F, and in particular the vector ﬁeld F0(α), can

be given an unique representation in terms of a suitable set of ﬂuid ﬁelds

ρo, V,p1, Q,Π

(cid:9)
deﬁned above by introducing a symmetrization condition on the mean ﬁeld force F0(α).To

(cid:8)

reach this conclusion it is actually suﬃcient to impose that the kinetic energy ﬂux equation

results parameter-independent and suitably deﬁned. Thus, let us consider the moment
equation which corresponds the kinetic energy ﬂux density G(x, t) = v u2

3 . Requiring that
f (x,t) is an arbitrary particular solution of the inverse kinetic equation (not necessarily

Maxwellian) for which the corresponding moment q =

d3vv u2

does not vanish identically, the related moment equation takes the form

which results proportional both to the velocity gradient ∇V and the relative kinetic energy

ﬂux Q, reads

Mα(f ) ≡ −(1 + α)Q·∇V + α∇V · Q.

In order to eliminate the indeterminacy of α, since α cannot depend on the kinetic distri-

bution function f, a possible choice is provided by the assumption that Mα(f ) takes the

symmetrized form

Mα(f ) = −

∇V · Q+

Q · ∇V,

which manifestly implies α = 1/2. Notice that the symmetrization condition can also be

viewed as a constitutive equation for the rate-of-change of the kinetic energy ﬂux vector.

In this sense, it is analogous to similar symmetrized constitutive equations adopted in cus-

tomary approaches to extended thermodynamics [12]. On the other hand, Eq.(9) implies

6

(8)

(9)

Mα(f ) = 1

2Q×ξ, ξ = ∇ × V being the vorticity ﬁeld. Thus, Mα(f ) can also be interpreted
as the rate-of-change of the kinetic energy ﬂux vector Q produced by vorticity ﬁeld ξ. From

Eq.(9) it follows that F0(α) reads

F0(α =

∇·Π − ∇p1 − f

(u · ∇V+∇V · u) + ν∇2V.

(10)

(cid:3)
Hence, the functional form of the streaming operator results uniquely determined. As a

1
2

result of the previous considerations, it is possible to establish the following uniqueness

theorem:

Let us assume that:

THEOREM 1 – Uniqueness of the Vlasov streaming operator L(F)

1) the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρ, V,p} and volume force density f(r, V, t) belong respectively

to the functional settings

V(r,t), p(r,t) ∈ C (0)(Ω × I), V(r,t), p(r,t) ∈ C (2,1)(Ω × I)

and

f(r, v, t) ∈ C (0)(Ω × I), f(r,t) ∈ C (1,0)(Ω × I)

;

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

(cid:9)
2) the operator L(F), deﬁning the inverse kinetic equation (2), has the form of the Vlasov

streaming operator L;

3) the solution, f (x, t), of the inverse kinetic equation (2) exists, results suitably smooth

in Γ × I and its velocity moments

ρo, V,p1, Q, Π

deﬁne the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρo, V,p} which

are classical solutions of INSE, together with Dirichlet boundary conditions and initial con-

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

ditions. In addition, the inverse kinetic equation admits, as particular solution, the local

Maxwellian distribution fM ;

4)

the mean-ﬁeld force F(α)

is a function only of

the extended ﬂuid ﬁelds

ρo, V,p1, Q, Π

, while the parameter α does not depend functionally on f (x, t);

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

5) the vector ﬁeld ∆1F0(α) satisﬁes the the symmetry condition (9).

Then it follows that the mean-ﬁeld force F in the inverse kinetic equation (2) is uniquely

deﬁned in terms of F = F0 + F1,where the vector ﬁelds F0 and F1 are given by Eqs. (10)

and (4).

PROOF

Let us consider ﬁrst the case in which the distribution function f (x, t) coincides with

the local Maxwellian distribution fM . In this case by deﬁnition the moments Q, Π vanish

identically while, by construction the mean mean-ﬁeld force is given by F(α) [see Eq.(5)],
α ∈ R being an arbitrary parameter. Let us now assume that f (x, t) is non-Maxwellian and

7

that its moment Mα(f ) deﬁned by Eq.(8) is non-vanishing. In this case the uniqueness of F

follows from assumptions 4 and 5. In particular the parameter α is uniquely determined by

the symmetry condition (9) in the moment Mα(f ). Since by assumption α is independent of

f (x, t) the result applies to arbitrary distribution functions (including the Maxwellian case).
Let us now introduce the vector ﬁeld F′= F+ ∆F, where the vector ﬁeld ∆F is assumed to

depend functionally on f (x, t) and deﬁned in such a way that:

A) the kinetic equation L(F′)f (x, t) = 0 yields an inverse kinetic theory for INSE, satis-

fying hypotheses 1-5 of the present theorem, and in particular it produces the same moment

equation of the inverse kinetic equation (2) for G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1

3u2;

B) there results identically ∆F(fM ) ≡ 0, i.e., ∆F vanishes identically in the case of a

local Maxwellian distribution fM .

Let us prove that necessarily ∆F(f ) ≡ 0 also for arbitrary non-Maxwellian distributions

f which are solutions of the inverse kinetic equation. First we notice that from A and B, due

to hypotheses 3 and 4, it follows that ∆F must depend linearly on Q, Π − p11. On the other

hand, again due to assumption A the vector ﬁeld ∆F must give a vanishing contribution
3u2.
(hypothesis 4)

to the moments the kinetic equation evaluated with respect to G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1
Hence, in order that also F′ depends only on the moments

ρo, V,p1, Q, Π

necessarily it must result ∆F(f ) ≡ 0 also for arbitrary non-Maxwellian distributions f.

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

IV. FULFILLMENT OF THE ENERGY EQUATION

As a further development, let us now impose the additional requirement that the inverse

kinetic theory yields explicitly also the energy equation (1). We intend to show that the

kinetic equation fulﬁlling such a condition can be obtained by a unique modiﬁcation of the

mean-ﬁeld force F ≡ F0(x,t) + F1(x,t), in particular introducing a suitable new deﬁnition

of the vector ﬁeld F1(x,t). The appropriate new representation is found to be

THEOREM 2 – Inverse kinetic theory for extended INSE

Let us require that:

1) assumptions 1-3 of Thm.1 are valid;

Then it follows that:

2) the mean-ﬁeld F is deﬁned in terms of F0 and F1 given by Eqs. (3) and (11).

A) {ρ, V,p} are classical solutions of extended INSE in Ω×I if and only if the Maxwellian

distribution function fM is a particular solution of the inverse kinetic equation (2);

B) provided that the solution f (x,t) of the inverse kinetic equation (2) exists in Γ × I

and results suitably summable in the velocity space U, so that the moment equations of (2)
3u2 exist, they coincide necessarily

corresponding to the weight-functions G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1

with extended INSE.

PROOF:

C) the two representations (4) and (11) for F1 coincide identically

A) The proof is straightforward. In fact, recalling Thm.1, in [3], we notice that Eqs. (11)

and (4) manifestly coincide if and only if the energy equation (1) is satisﬁed identically, i.e.,

if the ﬂuid ﬁelds are solutions of extended INSE.

B) The ﬁrst two moment equations corresponding to G(x,t) = 1, v are manifestly inde-

pendent of the form of F1, both in the case of Maxwellian and non-Maxwellian distributions,

i.e., (11) and (4). Hence, in such a case Thm.3 of [3] applies, i.e., the moment equations

yield INSE. Let us consider, in particular, the third moment equation corresponding to

G(x,t) = 1

Invoking Eqs. (10) and (11) for F0 and F1, the previous equation reduces to p1∇ · V = 0 if

and only if the energy equation (1) is satisﬁed. Since by construction p1 > 0, this yields the

isochoricity condition ∇ · V = 0.

C) Finally, since thanks to A) {ρ, V,p} are necessarily classical solutions of INSE, it

follows that they fulﬁll necessarily also the energy equation (1). Hence, (4) and (11) coincide

identically in Γ × I.

We conclude that (10) and (11) provide a new form of the inverse kinetic equation ap-

plying also to non-Maxwellian equilibria, which results alternative to that given earlier in

[3]. The new form applies necessarily to classical solutions. Since weak solutions (and hence

9

possibly also numerical solutions) of INSE may not satisfy exactly the energy equation, the

present inverse kinetic theory based on the new deﬁnition given above [see Eq.(4)] for the vec-

tor ﬁeld F(x,t) provides a necessary condition for the existence of strong solutions of INSE.

The result seems potentially relevant both from the conceptual viewpoint in mathematical

research and for numerical applications.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the non-uniqueness of the deﬁnition of the inverse kinetic equation deﬁned

by Ellero and Tessarotto (see [3]) has been investigated, proving that the mean-ﬁeld force

F characterizing such an equation depends on an arbitrary real parameter α. To resolve

the indeterminacy, a suitably symmetrization condition has been introduced for the kinetic

energy ﬂux moment equation. As a consequence, the functional form the mean-ﬁeld force F

which characterizes the inverse kinetic equation results uniquely determined. Furthermore,

we have proven the positivity of the kinetic distribution function. An open issue remains,

however, whether the inverse kinetic equation (2) satisﬁes an H-theorem, i.e., the entropy

results a mononically increasing function of time. Finally, as an additional development, we

have shown that, consistently with the assumption that the ﬂuid ﬁelds are strong solutions of

INSE, the mean-ﬁeld force can be expressed in such a way to satisfy explicitly also the energy

equation. The result appears signiﬁcant from the mathematical viewpoint, the physical

interpretation of the theory and potential applications to the investigation of complex ﬂuids,

such as for example those treated in [6, 10, 11]). In fact, it proves that the inverse kinetic

theory developed in [3] can be given an unique form which applies to classical solutions of

INSE.

Inertial Range Scaling, K´arm´an-Howarth
Theorem and Intermittency for Forced and
Decaying Lagrangian Averaged MHD in 2D

J. Pietarila Graham, D. D. Holm, P. Mininni and A. Pouquet

(Dated: Aug 23, 2005)

Abstract

We present an extension of the K´arm´am-Howarth theorem to the
Lagrangian averaged magnetohydrodynamic (LAMHD−α) equations.
The scaling laws resulting as a corollary of this theorem are studied
in numerical simulations, as well as the scaling of the longitudinal
structure function exponents indicative of intermittency. Numerical
simulations are presented both for freely decaying and for forced two
dimensional MHD turbulence, solving directly the MHD equations,
and employing the LAMHD−α equations at 1/2 and 1/4 resolution.
Linear scaling of the third-order structure function with length is ob-
served. The LAMHD−α equations also capture the anomalous scaling
of the longitudinal structure function exponents up to order 8.

1 Introduction

Turbulent ﬂows are ubiquitous in Nature and their very complexity make
them hard to understand, let alone predict. One reason is that turbulence
comes in intermittent “gusts”, such as fronts. These gusts are associated with
its non-Gaussian statistics, which allows strong events occurring in the “fat
tails” of the statistical distribution of, say, velocity gradients and other physi-
cal variables. From the theoretical viewpoint, its property of intermittency is
the sine qua non of turbulence. Intermittency may also trigger large scale ef-
fects, such as the apparently random reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Intermittency is a highly spatially and temporally localized phenomenon,
which thus requires high-resolution instrumentation, be it in the laboratory,
In the
in atmospheric and geophysical ﬂows or in numerical simulations.
latter case, the lack of adequate computer power (from the standpoint of the
geo-physicist) implies that modeling of the unresolved small scales must take
place. However, intermittency in general is not included explicitly in Large
Eddy Simulations (LES) models of turbulent processes.

The intermittency of the subgrid-scale (SGS) energy dissipation as is
usually deﬁned in LES has been studied ﬁltering 3D direct numerical simu-
lations (DNS) of non-conductive ﬂuids [1], with a Taylor Reynolds number
Rλ = 150; such a Reynolds number is somewhat insuﬃcient for a determi-
nation of third-order scaling. For the SGS dissipation, they ﬁnd that the
Smagorinsky model, the volume-averaged dynamic model, and the similar-
ity model perform fairly well (e.g. the error in the exponent for p = 7 is
less than 7%). On the other hand, the constant eddy-viscosity and spectral
eddy-viscosity models underestimate intermittency beyond p = 4 (compared
to DNS) while the local and clipped dynamic Smagorinsky models strongly
overestimate the intermittency beyond p = 4. In models not capturing in-
termittency properly, the question arises whether the overall statistics of the
ﬂow at large scales would be aﬀected by the absence of intermittency; and if
so, how intermittency should be incorporated.

There are many models of turbulent ﬂows (see for example the recent
review in [2]) and there are many turbulent ﬂows for which adequate testing
of such models is in order. Magnetohydrodynamics, i.e. the coupling of a
velocity and magnetic ﬁeld at sub-luminal velocities so that the displacement
current can be neglected, presents an interesting property, namely that in two
space dimensions (2D), intermittency occurs as well as in three dimensions
(3D). This is in contrast with the 2D neutral ﬂuid case for which the conser-

2

vation of vorticity leads to an inverse energy cascade to the large scales; in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, this conservation is broken by the Lorentz
force. Since, from a numerical standpoint, much higher Reynolds numbers
can be achieved in 2D, an intermittent ﬂow can be reached in 2D-MHD with
adequate scale separation between the energy-containing range, the inertial
range and the dissipation range. Our 2D MHD tests are able to exhibit a sub-
stantially larger Reynolds number (up to Rλ ∼ 1500) than the values listed
for previous studies. This fact provides an ideal testing ground for models
of turbulent MHD ﬂows, such as they occur in geophysics and astrophysics:
magnetic ﬁelds are observed in detail in the Earth and Sun environments,
and are known to be dynamically important as well for the solar-terrestrial
interactions (the so-called space weather), in the interstellar medium and in
galaxies.

Modeling of MHD ﬂows is still under development (see [3]). We have re-
cently tested one such model, the Lagrangian averaged magneto-hydrodynamics
alpha (LAMHD−α) model, both in 2D [4] and in 3D [5] and it has been used
to examine the onset of the dynamo instability when the magnetic Prandtl
number (the ratio of viscosity ν to magnetic diﬀusivity η) is small [6], as
occurs in liquid metals in the laboratory, in the liquid core of the Earth or
in the solar convection zone. In this context, because of the importance of
intermittency as a fundamental, or even deﬁning property of turbulence, we
seek to determine to what extent LAMHD−α exhibits intermittency.

Intermittency is believed to be associated only with a forward cascade of
energy; that is, the cascade of energy from larger scales to smaller scales, or,
equivalently, from low wave numbers to high wave numbers. As previously
mentioned, in determining the extent to which the LAMHD−α model ex-
hibits intermittency, we shall take advantage of the forward cascade of energy
which occurs in two-dimensional MHD. We shall ﬁrst investigate the spectral
scaling laws for this situation in Sec. 3, then its K´arm´an-Howarth theorem
in Sec. 4. Section 4 also discusses the modiﬁcations of the K´arm´an-Howarth
theorem for MHD which arise due to the presence of the length scale alpha (α)
in the LAMHD−α model. The length scale alpha modiﬁes the nonlinearity
in the motion equation, and one must estimate its observable physical eﬀects.
In particular, introduction of the length scale alpha modiﬁes the LAMHD−α
energy spectrum for kα > 1. Section 5 discusses energy conservation for the
LAMHD−α model and investigates its inviscid energy dissipation anomaly,
which arises from its scaling laws and its K´arm´an-Howarth theorem. Finally
in Sec. 6 we investigate the eﬀects of introducing the length scale alpha on

3

the intermittency of the LAMHD−α model solutions for decaying and forced
turbulence in two dimensions. Just as for Navier-Stokes turbulence, these ef-
fects emerge in numerical simulations as a scaling anomaly in the higher
order structure functions of the LAMHD−α model. Section 7 summarizes
these results.

2 Background of the LAMHD−α model

2.1 The LAMHD−α model equations

The Lagrangian-averaged magnetohydrodynamic alpha, or LAMHD−α model
was derived by Lagrangian averaging ordinary MHD along particle trajec-
tories [7]. Speciﬁcally, the LAMHD−α equations arise from Lagrangian-
averaging Hamilton’s principle for incompressible ideal MHD, after using a
form of Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen-in turbulent ﬂuctuations in the Euler-
Poincar´e equation for barotropic MHD from Ref. [8]. When Navier-Stokes
viscosity ν and diﬀusivity η are included in the standard fashion, the equa-
tions for the LAMHD−α model emerge as,

∂tu + us · ∇u − Bs · ∇B + (∇us)T · u + (∇B)T · Bs + ∇π = ν∆u,
∂tBs + us · ∇Bs − Bs · ∇us = η∆B,

div us = 0,

div Bs = 0 .

In these equations, subscript s denotes the smoothing obtained by inverting
the Helmholtz relations,

u = (1 − α2∆)us, B = (1 − α2

M ∆)Bs .

with Dirichlet boundary conditions,

us = 0 and Bs = 0

on the boundary .

The modiﬁed total pressure π in the motion equation for the LAMHD−α
model is deﬁned by

π +

|Bs|2 = p −

where p is the mechanical pressure. In these equations, α and αM are two
constant parameters: α characterizes the correlation length between the in-
stantaneous Lagrangian ﬂuid trajectory and its mean (time average); while

αM is its magnetic counterpart. These two parameters need not be equal, ab
initio. The traditional MHD system is obtained by setting both α = 0 and
αM = 0. Likewise, the LANS−α incompressible ﬂuid turbulence model is
obtained by setting Bs = 0. These equations may also be obtained through
a ﬁltering approach, as proposed in the ﬂuid case in [9].

2.2 Energy, momentum, circulation and linkages

The LAMHD−α system of equations (1-3) possesses the standard properties
of a normal ﬂuid theory. For example, the LAMHD−α system monotonically
dissipates the positive energy

servative form as

Thus, the two velocities appearing in the LAMHD−α model may be inter-
preted as ﬂuid parcel velocity us and momentum per unit mass u.

The Kelvin circulation theorem for the incompressible LAMHD−α mo-

tion equation (1) involves both of these velocities,

circulation of u around material loops moving with smoothed velocity us.

Thus, resistivity aﬀects the helicity, while both resistivity and viscosity aﬀect
the cross helicity, and these linkages are both preserved by LAMHD−α in
the ideal case. Of course, these properties of energy, momentum, circulation
and linkages for the LAMHD−α model all reduce to characteristics of normal
MHD, when α2 → 0.

2.3 Recasting LAMHD−α as an LES turbulence model

The LAMHD−α model modiﬁes the motion equation for ordinary MHD. By
a short sequence of manipulations, we may recast the LAMHD−α motion
equation into a form which is reminiscent of an LES turbulence model. We
begin with the following commutation relation,

p · ∇, (1 − α2∆)
(cid:2)
which holds for any vectors p and q. Two other useful vector identities are,

∇q · ∇p + ∇q · ∇pT

q = α2div

= −α2div (∇uT

(15)

= α2div (∇BT

s · ∇Bs) (16)

(cid:17)

where α = αM was assumed. Consequently, the motion equation in the
incompressible LAMHD−α model may be rewritten equivalently in “LES
form” as,

(1 − α2∆) (∂tus + us · ∇us − Bs · ∇Bs + ∇˜πs − ν∆us) = −α2div τ,

(17)

6

where the divergence of the “stress tensor” τ is given by

div τ = div (∇us · ∇us + ∇us · ∇uT

s − ∇uT

s · ∇us)

− div (∇Bs · ∇Bs + ∇Bs · ∇BT

s − ∇BT

s · ∇Bs) ,

(18)

and gradient terms have been absorbed into the modiﬁed total pressure ˜π =
(1 − α2∆)˜πs, which is given by

3 Inertial range scaling laws in forward en-

ergy cascade

In two space dimensions, the conservation of vorticity in the neutral (B ≡ 0
case) leads to an inverse energy cascade; however, the Lorentz force breaks
this conservation and, in MHD, energy is found to be mostly transferred to
the small scales both in 2D and in 3D. Several measurements, starting with
satellite data in the solar wind and continuing more recently with direct nu-
merical simulations both in two dimensions and three dimensions, indicate
that the energy spectrum of a turbulent MHD ﬂow follows a law that is
barely distinguishable from a neutral ﬂuid, with E(k) ∼ k−1.70. Diﬀerences
do occur when one examines higher order structure functions: the most inter-
mittent case (almost comparable in magnitude to that of the passive scalar)
is the two-dimensional MHD ﬂuid; three-dimensional MHD appears less in-
termittent than the 2D MHD case [10], and the 3D neutral ﬂuid is the lesser
intermittent of the three. Intermittency has been observed in the Solar Wind
as well. None of the data at the second order level is in agreement with the
phenomenologies developed by Kolmogorov [11] and leading to an energy
spectrum E(k) ∼ k−5/3 (heretofore the K41 model) or by Iroshnikov and by
Kraichnan [12] (heretofore, the IK model) and leading to a shallower spec-
trum, viz. E(K) ∼ k−3/2 in the absence of signiﬁcant velocity-magnetic ﬁeld
correlations. These two types of phenomenology diﬀer by the taking into
account in the latter case of the non-local interactions (in Fourier space) em-
anating from the propagation of Alfv´en waves; it is worth mentioning here
that the IK model also agrees with the isotropic limit of the weak turbulence
theory for incompressible MHD [13]. Note also that a model of intermittency
for MHD ﬂows [14] does recover the intermittency as measured in direct nu-
merical simulations both in 2D [14] and in 3D [10], but such models depend
on two adjustable parameters and thus do not necessarily have a predictive
power.

These anomalous scaling laws are not fully understood but, for the neutral
case, there is an exact law at third order with which the K41 phenomenology
is compatible. In MHD, the exact law is more complex in its structure since it
involves third-order cross-correlations between the velocity and the magnetic
ﬁeld [15] whereas the phenomenologies evoked above refer to single-variable
moments. In that instance, it is worth asking what is the equivalent exact
law in the context of the LAMHD−α model, a task developed in the next

8

section. The question also arises as to what is the spectrum of energy beyond
the alpha cut-oﬀ scales (which we take equal here, although diﬀerent choices
can be made, see e.g. [5, 6]). The answer should be guided by what is the
pseudo-invariant in the small scales, beyond α. In the neutral ﬂuid case, it
is the enstrophy hω2i and in MHD this becomes hω2i + hj2i, where j is the
current density. A Kolmogorov-like dimensional reasoning (see [16] for the
LANS−α case) taking into account this pseudo-invariance law will lead to a
k−3 spectrum at scales smaller than α whereas it can be easily shown that
the corresponding IK arguments lead to a k−5/2 law.

4 K´arm´an-Howarth theorem for LAMHD−α

in 2D and 3D Els¨asser variables

In 1938, K´arm´an and Howarth [17] introduced the invariant theory of isotropic
hydrodynamic turbulence, and derived from the Navier-Stokes equations an
exact law relating the time derivative of the two-point velocity correlation
with the divergence of the third-order correlation function. Later, this result
was generalized to the MHD case by Chandrasekar [18], and recently written
in terms of Els¨asser variables [15]. For LANS−α in the ﬂuid case it was de-
rived in [19]. The relevance of the K´arm´an-Howarth theorem for the study of
turbulence cannot be underestimated. As a corollary, rigorous scaling laws
in the inertial range can be deduced. In this section we will generalize these
results to the LAMHD−α case.

For the sake of simplicity, we will consider the case η = ν = 0, the
dissipative terms can be added at any point in the derivation. Also, we will
use α = αM . We start writing the LAMHD−α equations using the Els¨asser
variables

z± = u ± B,

Applying the Helmholtz operator to eq. (1), we obtain

1 − α2∆
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(∂tBs + us · ∇Bs − Bs · ∇us) = 0.

Now we add and subtract eqs. (17) and (24). Using eqs. (23) we obtain

ij must be symmetric and divergence free in i and j. But the Els¨asser
variables z± are combinations of vectors and pseudovectors. Therefore, Q±
is a combination of tensors and pseudotensors. We can deﬁne a tensor as

ij and T ±k

Q = Q± + Q∓,

(43)

and a pseudotensor as Q± − Q∓. We will continue using only the tensor Q,
the results can also be obtained for the pseudotensors using the expressions
in [18]. We also deﬁne T = T ± + T ∓ and S = S± + S∓.

Imposing isotropy and from incompressibility, Q can be written as [20]

Qij = curl(Qrlǫijl) = −(d + 1)Qδij + rQ′

dimensions. Here, Q′ = ∂rQ.

This is the generalization of the K´arm´an-Howarth equation for LAMHD−α
(two more equations can be written for diﬀerent combinations of the tensors
and pseudotensors), without the dissipation. When B = 0 this equation is
also eq. (3.16) in [19]. When α = 0, this is equivalent to the K´arm´an-Howarth
equation for the Els¨asser variables as derived in [15], or a combination of
equations (49) and (53) in [18].

Therefore, all equations in [15] follow for α/r ≪ 1. This result conﬁrms
that the alpha-model preserves the properties of MHD for separations larger
than r ∼ α. For r > α, the scaling of structure functions and the relation
between second and third order functions hold.

Note a multiplicative factor compared with the usual expression from Kol-

ture functions in isotropic turbulence in d dimensions. For α/r ≪ 1 this
equation reduces again to the MHD results. Note also that structure and
autocorrelation functions in LAMHD−α involve one unsmoothed ﬁeld and
one smoothed ﬁeld if quantities are of second order, and two smoothed ﬁelds
if quantities are of third order. In the following sections, we will use this con-
vention and all structure functions for LAMHD−α will be written as they
follow from the expressions of the tensors Q and T .

5 Energy dissipation anomaly

The K´arm´an–Howarth (KH) theorem for ﬂuid turbulence [17] gives the ex-
act analytical relation between the time rate of change of the second-order
two-point velocity correlation function and the gradient of the third-order
two-point velocity correlation function, as derived from the Navier-Stokes
equation for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence.

Kolmogorov [11] used the structure function form of the KH equation,
to show – for homogeneous, isotropic and stationary turbulence, in the limit
ν → 0 of vanishing kinematic viscosity – that the Navier-Stokes equations
lead to an exact relationship between the third-order structure function and
the energy dissipation rate, ǫ, which scales linearly in the separation, r. This
is Kolmogorov’s famous “four-ﬁfths law.”

By assuming self-similarity of scales in the inertial range Kolmogorov
then was able to deduce, in steps that essentially amount to dimensional
analysis, that the second-order structure function must scale as r2/3 and that
consequently the energy spectrum (which is essentially the Fourier transform
of the second-order structure function) must scale as k−5/3. As noted in [21],
Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfths law

is one of the most important results in fully developed turbu-
lence because it is both exact and nontrivial. It thus constitutes
a kind of ‘boundary condition’ on theories of turbulence: such
theories, to be acceptable, must either satisfy the four-ﬁfths law,
or explicitly violate the assumptions made in deriving it.

The two key assumptions in Kolmogorov’s derivation of the four-ﬁfths law
are that (1) an inertial range exists in which the ﬂow is self-similar and (2)
the energy dissipation rate does not change as one takes the limit ν → 0.

The equivalent of the KH equation was derived for the LANS−α model
in [19]. Since the model relates the Helmholtz smoothed velocity us, to the
unsmoothed velocity u, the appropriate correlation functions that emerge
are the second- and third-order two-point correlation between us and u.
Upon following Kolmogorov’s analysis for isotropic inertial range statistics,
the corollary to the LANS−α KH-equation is that solutions of the LANS−α
equations possess two regimes of scaling, depending on whether the separa-
tion distance r is greater, or less than the size α. For r > α, the third-order
correlation scales like r, thereby recovering Navier-Stokes behavior. In con-
trast, for r < α the third-order correlation scales like r3. If self-similarity

14

is then assumed one ﬁnds for r > α that the second-order correlation scales
like r2/3, again recovering Navier-Stokes behavior. However, for r < α the
second-order correlation scales like r2. Correspondingly, the power spectrum
for the smoothed velocity u has two regimes, with a transition from k−5/3
for kα < 1 to k−3 for kα > 1. Thus, the KH-theorem for the LANS−α
model derived in [19] is consistent with the spectral scaling results found for
it in [16] by dimensional arguments. We shall apply similar reasoning to the
LAMHD−α model in two dimensions.

Diﬀerences from MHD turbulence theory for r < α

The second term in the “−2/d(d+2) Law” in equation (49) (the α2 S term on
the right side) is reminiscent of the quantity that appears in the correspond-
ing “−2 Law” for enstrophy cascade in 2D turbulence. The latter expression
contains two powers of enstrophy and one power of velocity. For example,
see the Appendix B of [22], where this identity for 2D turbulence is derived
in detail.

Likewise, the α2 S term in (49) for LAMHD−α in 2D contains two pow-
ers of gradients ∇zs and one power of zs without gradient. Consequently,
this should be the dominant term (compared to the ﬁrst T −term) for small
separations, when r < α. If in addition the LAMHD−α ﬂow is self-similar,
the dominance of the α2 S term in (49) when r < α implies a scaling re-
lation for the second-order structure functions. Following [11] as ampliﬁed
by [21], let the longitudinal diﬀerence δz(x, r) satisfy the scaling relation
δz(x, λr) = λhδz(x, r) for all x and for increments r and λr small compared
to α. By dimensional analysis, [S(λr)] = [(δz)3/r3] = [S(r)]. Consequently,
3h − 3 = 0 and h = 1 for small scales r < α in a self-similar LAMHD−α
ﬂow. This means the second-order structure functions follow r2 scaling for
r < α in such a ﬂow. This r2 scaling implies a k−3 law for the spectral
density of smoothed kinetic and magnetic energy in that range for the 2D
LAMHD−α model. Thus, one ﬁnds a self-similar k−3 “enstrophy-like” cas-
cade, in agreement with similar considerations of [16] for the kinetic energy
spectral density in the 3D LANS−α model.

Implications of the k−5/3 → k−3 spectral scaling transition for the
LAMHD−α dissipation anomaly. The second term in the “−2/d(d + 2)
Law” in equation (49) modiﬁes Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfths law at small sepa-
rations (r < α), provided one may assume constancy of total LAMHD−α

15

energy dissipation as ν → 0. This is the “energy dissipation anomaly” for
the LAMHD−α model. A technical argument using embedding theorems for
Besov spaces ﬁrst introduced in [23] implies that constancy of total energy
dissipation may hold as ν → 0 for a turbulent ﬂuid in two dimensions, pro-
vided its L2 power spectrum is not steeper than k−4. The k−3 spectrum for
kα > 1 is not too steep; so the roll-oﬀ k−5/3 → k−3 in the LAMHD−α power
spectrum is consistent with the necessary condition for possessing such an en-
ergy dissipation anomaly. Hence, the k−3 behavior in the L2 power spectrum
of the LAMHD−α model for kα > 1 and the corresponding modiﬁcation for
separations r < α of Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfths law derived in [19] are both
consistent with the assumption of constant dissipation of total kinetic energy
as the Reynolds number tends to inﬁnity.

Implications of the spectral scaling transition for IK scaling instead
of Kolmogorov scaling. While in hydrodynamic turbulence the spectral
transfer is believed to be a local process, in MHD turbulence Iroshnikov and
Kraichnan proposed that the spectral transfer is governed by nonlocal Alfv´en
wave interactions (see [24] for a study of non-locality of transfer in MHD).
If a large scale magnetic ﬁeld is present, then this ﬁeld acts as a guide ﬁeld
to the ﬂuctuations, turning them into Alfv´en waves. Kraichnan proposed
that Alfvenic propagation limits the nonlinear interaction responsible for
the transfer of energy to smaller eddies in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds.
As a result, the IK spectrum is shallower than K41. In LAMHD−α , the
k−3 spectrum at scales smaller than α turns into a shallower k−5/2 when
the IK hypotheses are used. Note that the weakening of local interactions
due to Alfv´en waves holds in LAMHD−α at the smoothed scales, and the
energy dissipation anomaly should also be captured. This is also in agreement
with equations (25) and (27), which show that Alfv´en waves are also exact
nonlinear solutions of the LAMHD−α equations.

6 Numerical results for intermittency and scal-

ing anomaly

In this section, we compare intermittency in LAMHD−α to that of direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of the MHD equations, regarded as true at a
given Reynolds number. Intermittency is associated both with the presence

16

of strong localized structures and with the existence of strong non-Gaussian
wings in the probability distribution functions. We have previously inves-
tigated the latter in [4] and we concentrate here on the strong localized
structures giving rise to deviations from universality, as can be studied by
examining high order statistical moments, such as the structure functions.
We deﬁne the longitudinal structure function of a ﬁeld f as Sf
p(l) ≡
h|δfL|pi where δfL = (f(x + l) − f(x)) · l/l is the longitudinal increment of f.
In the inertial range between the large energy-containing scales and the small
dissipative scales, the structure functions are assumed to vary in a self-similar
manner, Sf
p . As previously mentioned, in isotropic and homogeneous
turbulence the structure functions can be related to the correlation functions
discussed in Section 4. K41 phenomenology predicts ζ v
p = p/3, while IK
gives ζ ±
p = p/4. The anomalous departure of the exponents ζp from these
linear scaling laws is a measure of intermittency-induced deviations from
universality.

p(l) ∼ lζ f

To numerically solve the MHD and LAMHD−α equations we will use a
parallel pseudospectral code as described in [4]. In two dimensions, the ve-
locity and magnetic ﬁeld are expressed as the curl of a scalar stream function
Ψ and a one component vector potential Az, respectively:

u = ∇ × (Ψˆz), us = ∇ × (Ψsˆz)

B = ∇ × (Azˆz), Bs = ∇ × (Aszˆz)
where Ψ = (1 − α2∇2)Ψs, and Az = (1 − α2
M ∇2)Asz .
quantities, the 2D MHD equations may be expressed as

In terms of these

∂t∇2Ψ = [Ψ, ∇2Ψ] − [Az, ∇2Az] + ν∇2∇2Ψ

where

∂tAz = [Ψ, Az] + η∇2Az,

[F, G] = ∂xF ∂yG − ∂xG∂yF

is the standard Poisson bracket. The LAMHD−α equations (1-3) modify
this two dimensional structure by introducing smoothed variables as

∂t∇2Ψ = [Ψs, ∇2Ψ] − [Asz , ∇2Az] + ν∇2∇2Ψ

In the following subsections we test the LAMHD−α model against MHD
results (for which α = αM = 0) for freely decaying turbulence with the
same initial conditions, dissipation and time-stepping, and also for forced
turbulence where we have averaged statistics over 189 turnover times taken
from 9 experiments with distinct seeds for the random forcing, resulting in a
data set of ∼ 2 · 108 points.

6.1 Forced simulations

In this subsection we consider forced turbulence with η = ν = 1.6 × 10−4.
Four sets of simulations were carried out, one set of MHD fully-resolved
simulations with 10242 grid points, and three sets of LAMHD−α simulations,
with 5122 grid points and α = αM = 6/512, with 2562 grid points and
α = αM = 6/256, and with 2562 grid points and α = αM = 6/128. Note that
the 2562 LAMHD−α simulation with α = αM = 6/128 could be carried with
a 1282 spatial resolution (see e.g. criteria for the selection of the value of α
and the linear resolution in [4]). The reason to keep the resolution ﬁxed at
2562 is to preserve the amount of spatial statistics, crucial to measure high
order exponents as will be shown later.

Both the momentum and the vector potential equations were forced. The
expressions of the external forces were loaded in the Fourier ring between
k = 1 and k = 2, and the phases were changed randomly with a correlation
time ∆t = 5 × 10−2. Averaged over space, the amplitudes of the external
forces were held constant to FM = 0.2 in the vector potential equation,
and FK = 0.45 in the momentum equation. The systems were evolved in
time until reaching a turbulent steady state, and then the simulations were
extended for 21 turnover times. Over this time span, 21 snapshots of the
ﬁelds from each run were used to compute the longitudinal increments. As
previously mentioned, each set of simulations (DNS, and LAMHD−α with
diﬀerent spatial resolutions) comprises nine runs with the same viscosity and
diﬀusivity but diﬀerent series of random phases in the external forcing, to
have enough statistics to determine the scaling exponents up to eighth order
with small error bars. The total number of points was ∼ 2 · 108 for the DNS
and ∼ 1.2 · 107 points for the 2562 LAMHD−α simulations.

During these intervals, the integral Reynolds number based on the r.m.s.

18

velocity ﬂuctuates around 2200. The normalized correlation coeﬃcient be-
tween the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld is 20% with a standard devi-
ation of 16% within the set of nine runs, and its unsigned counterpart
2h|u · B|i/h|u|2 + |B|2i, is ∼ 29% ± 12%. The ratio of the integral scale
to the Taylor scale computed on the r.m.s. ﬁelds ﬂuctuates around 10 for
all the simulations. The ratio of magnetic to kinetic energies is ∼ 2 for all
runs. Finally, the Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumbers kν = (hω2i /ν2)1/4
and kη = (hj2i /η2)1/4 ﬂuctuate around 330, values substantially larger than
the largest resolved wavenumbers kα ∼ 1/α in all LAMHD−α simulations,
by virtue of the model.

Average omni-directional spectra for magnetic and kinetic energies over
these 189 turnover times are shown in Figure 1. All spectra display an iner-
tial range, and the LAMHD−α simulations are able to capture the spectral
behavior up to k ≈ 1/α.

Following the Extended Self-Similarity (ESS) hypothesis [25], it is sug-
gested in Ref. [15] that the third-order, mixed structure functions may pro-
vide a better independent variable (as opposed to length) against which to
determine the scaling exponents of high-order structure functions for MHD.

These results for the third-order structure functions are exact and can
be used to compute more accurate anomalous scaling exponents of structure
functions of higher order. Due to cancellation problems (linked with having
limited statistics), absolute values are often employed; we also ﬁnd linear
scaling in this case, viz.:

L±(l) ≡ h|δz∓

L ||δz±|2i ∝ l .

(58)

As follows from the expressions given in Sec. 4 and the invariants found for
both MHD and LAMHD−α [4, 7], when making comparisons between DNS
and model runs, we substitute the H 1
αi = h|u·us|i [8, 26], for the
regular L2 norm, h|u|2i = h|u · u|i, whenever we consider quantities for the
LAMHD−α model. Accordingly we determine the relative scaling exponents,

Figure 2 shows the third-order mixed structure function L+

has a identiﬁable range of validity, as can be seen in the ﬁgure by compari-
son with the solid line denoting the computed slope L+(l) ∼ l0.99, over the
inertial range, 10 ≤ k ≤ 20, indicated by dashed lines. The LAMHD−α runs
display the same scaling as the MHD simulation, and a departure is only
observed for scales smaller than α (for the 2562 runs, α ≈ 0.15, 0.29 and for
the 5122 run, α ≈ 0.07 as indicated by dotted lines). Note that the results
have been scaled by the mean value of L+
(s)(l). As the average energies of the
runs are disparate, this improves the ease of comparison. The same behavior
is observed for L−

(s)(l).

The scaling of the third-order structure function S+

similar scaling to what is found in DNS of MHD. A line indicates the best ﬁt

dotted vertical lines); note that all errors presented and shown in the ﬁgures
correspond to 3σ where σ is the standard deviation. The much smaller in-
ertial range is indicated by dashed vertical lines and arrows indicate lengths
α. This is the main beneﬁt of using the ESS hypothesis. While in the 10242
simulation there is enough statistics to measure the scaling exponents ξp in
the inertial range, when we use the LAMHD−α equations to reduce the com-
putational cost, the amount of spatial statistics is drastically reduced (e.g.
by a factor of 16 in the 2563 runs). The ESS hypothesis allows us to extend
the range where the ξp exponents are computed, giving a better estimation
and smaller error bars. This is important to measure high order exponents,
where the slope is extremely sensitive to statistics. As an example, in Fig.
4 we show the scaling of the eight-order structure function S+

The anomalous scaling results for the DNS runs are shown in Table 1.
Though our goal here is to test LAMHD−α against DNS, we remark brieﬂy
on the correspondence between our scaling exponents and other studies. In
opposition to the ﬁndings of [28], we ﬁnd ξ±
4 > 1. We note,
however, that the forcing in [28] was tailored to maintain at a constant level
all Fourier modes with k = 1 while our forcing is random with a constant
amplitude between k = 1 and k = 2. As can be seen from Table 1, our
results for ξ+
p are in good agreement with [10], for decaying turbulence, and
with [29], for forced turbulence. As [10] suggests, the scaling exponents, as
inertial range properties, may depend on the character of the driving due to
non-local processes in the cascade dynamics connected with the Alfv´en eﬀect

(see also [24]); and as Ref. [28] points out, such an analysis can be sensitive
to several parameters such as the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energy or the
amount of correlation between the velocity and the magnetic ﬁelds.

Figure 6 shows the scaling exponents for the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds,
as well as for the other Els¨asser variable z−. The anomalous scaling is
matched by LAMHD−α up to and including eighth-order. The results from
the MHD and LAMHD−α simulations are also in good agreement with Ref.
[29]. Note that the magnetic ﬁeld is more intermittent than the velocity
ﬁeld (in the sense that the scaling exponents deviate more from a straight
line), as previously found in numerical simulations [28]; it may be related to
the fact that in MHD, nonlinear interactions are more non-local (in Fourier
space) than for ﬂuids [24]. This well known feature of MHD turbulence is
also properly captured by the LAMHD−α equations.

6.2 Decaying simulations

In this subsection we brieﬂy discuss simulations of free decaying turbulence
using both the MHD and the LAMHD−α equations. The results are sim-
ilar to the ones presented in the previous subsection for forced turbulence.
However, since no turbulent steady state can be deﬁned in freely decaying
runs, the amount of statistics is reduced because only a few snapshots of the
velocity and magnetic ﬁeld during the peak of mechanic and magnetic dis-
sipation can be used to compute structure functions. To partially overcome
this problem, we will discuss simulations with higher spatial resolution than
the ones presented in the forced case.

A fully resolved 20482 MHD run was made using ν = η = 10−4, as well as
a 10242 LAMHD−α run with α = αM = 6/1024 and a 5122 LAMHD−α run
with α = αM = 6/512. The initial velocity and magnetic ﬁelds were loaded
with random phases into the rings from k = 1 to k = 3 in Fourier space. The
initial r.m.s. values of u and B are equal to unity. No external forces are
applied and the system decays freely as a result of the dissipation. Under
these conditions, the LAMHD−α equations have been shown to reproduce
the time evolution of the magnetic and kinetic energy, as well as the evolution
of the spectra and other statistical quantities [4].

The magnetic and kinetic energy spectra between t = 3 and t = 6 in
units of the eddy turnover time (the time for which a quasi-steady state
is observed) display an inertial range with an extent of approximately one
decade in Fourier space, from k ≈ 3 up to k ≈ 30. As a result, one snapshot of

the ﬁelds in this range in time was used to compute the longitudinal structure
functions. The Kolmogorov kinetic and magnetic dissipation wavenumbers
kν and kη peaked at a value of 470, larger than the ﬁltering wavenumber kα ∼
1/α in all the LAMHD−α simulations. We note that for large wavelength
component behavior up to k ∼ kα, both LAMHD−α simulations accurately
reproduced the omni-directional spectra for the magnetic and kinetic energies
as was shown previously for the forced runs.

Both LAMHD−α runs preserve the scaling of the longitudinal structure
function exponents observed in the MHD simulation. As an example, Fig.
7 shows the ξp exponents for the z+ Els¨asser variable for the MHD and
LAMHD−α simulations using the ESS hypothesis. Note that the ξp expo-
nents of the three simulations lie within the error bars, and the three simula-
tions show departures from the self-similar K41 or IK scaling. For values of p
larger than 6, eﬀects associated with the limited amount of spatial statistics
can be observed in all the runs.

7 Discussion and outlook

Suﬃcient resolution for studying directly high Reynolds number ﬂows as
encountered in geophysics and astrophysics is today well beyond technological
limits. Closures such as the Lagrangian-averaged alpha-model can reduce the
computational burden by reducing the resolution requirements. However, to
be used as a model of hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,
or for applications in astrophysics and geophysics, detailed knowledge of the
ability of the LANS−α or LAMHD−α equations to capture key features of
turbulent ﬂows is required.

The LANS−α and LAMHD−α equations have been tested against direct
numerical simulations in a variety of problems (see e.g. [30] for neutral ﬂuid
studies and [4, 5, 6] for studies in conducting ﬂuids). Most of these works
compared the time evolution of ideal invariants for forced and free decaying
turbulence, as well as the evolution of energy spectra. Also, some statistical
comparisons were performed (e.g. studying the behavior of probability den-
sity functions). In this work, we apply a more stringent test to these models.
Intermittency is a well known feature of turbulent ﬂows, associated with the
existence of strong events localized both in space and time. Intermittency
can trigger large scale events, aﬀect the transport coeﬃcients, or give rise to
corrections in the turbulent scaling. As a result, whether a model can cap-

crosses, diamonds, and triangles respectively. The K41 scaling is the dashed

ture the statistics of intermittent events is of utmost importance to model
astrophysical or geophysical ﬂows. The study of intermittency also requires
computation of high order statistics, thereby extending previous comparisons
between DNS and α-models.

An extension of the K´arm´an-Howarth theorem (KH-α) was proven for the
LANS−α equations in Ref. [19]. As a corollary of this theorem, Kolmogorov
four-ﬁfths law and Kolmogorov’s energy spectrum can be derived for the
LANS−α equations at scales larger than α. In this work, we extended the
KH-α theorem to the LAMHD−α case, proving as a result that for scales
larger than α the LAMHD−α equations satisfy the scaling laws previously
known for MHD turbulence [15, 18]. This is an important result, since MHD
turbulence involves two coupled ﬁelds (the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds) and
can display diﬀerent power laws in the inertial range according to the regime
of interest. While LES often impose a particular regime and a power law [3],
the LAMHD−α equations are shown to satisfy the general scalings satisﬁed
by the MHD equations without any hypothesis about the scaling followed in
the inertial range.

The extension of the KH-α theorem to the LAMHD−α case also allows
us to deﬁne correlation and structure functions in the α-model. With these
functions, the analysis of anomalous scaling and intermittency can be per-
formed. Numerical simulations were presented both for freely decaying and
for forced two dimensional MHD turbulence, solving directly the MHD equa-
tions, and employing the LAMHD−α equations at 1/2 and 1/4 resolution (a
case equivalent to 1/8 of the DNS resolution was also considered for forced
turbulence). In the forced runs, we have averaged statistics over 189 turn-
over times (and up to ∼ 2 · 108 points) to test if the LAMHD−α equations
reproduces intermittent turbulent behavior. The scaling of the third-order
structure function was tested and linear scaling with length (down to length
α) was observed, in good agreement with corollaries of the extended KH-α
theorem and exact laws in MHD turbulence [15]. The LAMHD−α equa-
tions also capture high-order statistics (up to and including order 8) and the
anomalous scaling of the longitudinal structure function exponents, with a
net gain in speed close to a factor of 16.

Relying on the fact that, contrary to ﬂuids, two dimensional MHD tur-
bulence displays a direct cascade of energy and intermittency, we could show
that the LAMHD−α equations reproduce intermittency features of turbu-
lent ﬂows and thus we postulate that these results will carry over to the
three-dimensional case and thus these results could be also of relevance to

31

the modeling of neutral ﬂuids.

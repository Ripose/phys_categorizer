General phenomenological theory of hydrodynamic waves in regions with smooth loss of convexity of isen-
tropes is developed based on the fact that for most media these regions in p -V plane are anomalously small.
Accordingly the waves are usually weak and can be described in the manner analogous to that for weak shock
waves of compression. The corresponding generalized Burgers equation is derived and analyzed. The exact
solution of the equation for steady shock waves of rarefaction is obtained and discusses.

PACS numbers: 47.40.-x, 43.25.+y, 52.35.Mw

Extremely great importance of the so-called elementary
wave patterns, such as shock and rarefaction waves, in hy-
drodynamics has been known since the pioneering studies of
Riemann [1] carried out in the beginning of 1860s. The im-
portance is generally connected with (i) possibility to picture
general ﬂuids ﬂows as nonlinear superposition of elementary
waves, propagating as separate entities and (ii) reﬂection with
the elementary waves the asymptotic behavior of general so-
lutions of the set of hydrodynamic equations. For this reason a
great deal of attention has been payed to study the elementary
waves, see, e.g., the review article [2] and references therein.
Nonetheless, a certain type of the elementary waves, namely
shock waves of rarefaction and sonic waves [2], which admits
general analytical consideration, has not been considered in
such a manner. The gap is ﬁlled up in the present Letter.

It is well known that the sign of variation of pressure and
density in a weak shock wave is associated with the sign of
(∂2V /∂p2)s. Usually the sign of the derivative is positive,
and accordingly the shock wave is compressive. However, in
some speciﬁc areas of p -V plane, e.g., close to a critical point
but still in a single-phase region, (∂2V /∂p2)s may become
negative. The phenomenon is known as smooth loss of con-
vexity of isentropes [2] and is quite general for many types of
equations of states of real materials. Even the van der Waals
equation possesses a region around the vapor dome, where
(∂2V /∂p2)s < 0 [3]. In 1942 Bethe showed that all ﬂuids
having sufﬁciently large speciﬁc heats exhibit smooth loss of
convexity of isentropes in the neighborhood of the saturated
vapor line [4].

The smooth loss of convexity of isentropes creates pre-
requisites for a shock wave of rarefaction (SWR) to come
into being. Moreover, other types of anomalous wave struc-
tures, such as sonic shocks, whose Mach number(s) before
the shock, after it, or both is (are) identically equal 1, may
be observed in this region and its vicinity, see Refs. [2,3] for
more details. Bearing in mind all mentioned above, it is highly
desirable to have a certain universal equation, which is not
connected with any particular equation of state but neverthe-

less can describe hydrodynamics waves in the discussed re-
gion. Despite the apparent importance of the problem and its
long history, much to our surprise, nobody has payed attention
to the following consequence of the fact that usually the re-
gion with the smooth loss of convexity of isentropes occupies
a small domain in p -V plane. The consequence is that the
corresponding waves are always weak (otherwise the wave
curves [5] go far away from the domain), and therefore the
problem of the wave description is tractable within the frame-
work of the macroscopic hydrodynamics in the manner anal-
ogous to that for weak shock waves of compression. To be
precise we must stipulate that we do not consider any singu-
larities related to the very vicinity to the critical point. In other
words, it is implied the system is far enough from it to avoid
any effect of the singularities.

In the present Letter the mentioned approach is applied to
the problem. As a result the generalized Burgers equation,
which describes hydrodynamic waves in the region, where
the derivative (∂2V /∂p2)s is small and may change sign is
derived. The equation is valid for both signs of the derivative
and therefore describes all the variety of waves, which may
exist in this region. As an example the equation is employed
to study steady shock waves of rarefaction (SWR). The gen-
eral exact solutions of the equation describing such shocks is
obtained and analysed.

To begin with, let us consider the conventional Burgers
equation, which governs a weak shock wave of compression.
In the laboratory coordinate frame for a wave advancing in the
negative direction of x-axis the equation reads [6]

Eq. (1) may be regarded as leading approximation to expan-
sion of a certain more general nonlinear dissipative equation
in powers of both weak nonlinearity and weak dissipation. It
is important that the nonlinear term in this approximation is
considered in non-dissipative limit. Dissipative corrections to
it have additional smallness and may be neglected.

is anomalously small (it even can
vanish). Accordingly, the lowest nonlinearity αp′(∂p′/∂x)
may not correspond to the leading nonlinear term any more.
It means that higher order (in p′) terms must be taken into ac-
count. On the other hand, the region, where (∂2V /∂p2)s < 0,
is narrow, therefore the third derivative (∂3V /∂p3)s also has
a certain smallness in this region. Only the fourth derivative
(∂4V /∂p4)s does not have any smallness there. Thus, at small
but ﬁnite p′ terms O
may

yield contributions of the same order of magnitude and must
be taken into account simultaneously. It is important that dis-
sipative corrections to the nonlinear terms remain negligible
and all such terms may be considered in the non-dissipative
limit, in the same manner as it is for the conventional Burgers
equation. All the above mentioned is related exclusively to
nonlinear terms. Regarding the dissipative term on the right
hand side of Eq. (1), there are no speciﬁc reasons for it to be
small and no correction to this term is required.

To derive the desired nonlinear corrections to the left hand
side of Eq. (1) let us consider an arbitrary adiabatic ﬂow in the
form of a traveling wave. Due to the adiabatic condition the
proﬁle of entropy of such a ﬂow should not change, and since
the state of the medium ahead of the shock front is spatially
homogeneous with s = const, we obtain that s = const
anywhere. Then, we may employ the general solution of the
continuity and Euler equations valid for simple waves [6] and
reduce these equations to the following single equation

where the ﬂow velocity v is given by the expression

Sign plus in Eqs. (2)–(3) corresponds to the wave advancing
in the positive x direction, minus to negative. According to

(2)

(3)

our choice of the direction of the wave propagation in what
follows we take sign minus.

It is important to stress that under the above-speciﬁed con-
ditions the reduction of the set of hydrodynamic equations to
Eqs. (2)–(3) is an exact result valid for any nonlinear depen-
dence c(p) and ρ(p), which may be obtained for the isentropic
wave. However, if p′ is small one can expand these functions
about the point p′ = 0. It is seen straightforwardly that if one
truncates the expansion at zero term, it reduces Eqs. (2)–(3)
to the linear acoustic equation. The truncation at the term of
order O(p′) yields the left hand side of Eq. (1). Increasing the
order of the truncation one can obtain the desired corrections
to the conventional Burgers equation with any given accuracy.
Thus, the generalized Burgers equation must have the form

where u stands for the velocity of a point in the wave proﬁle.

c(p′) [7].

To get the equation in the explicit form one must expand
u(p′) in powers of small p′ retaining the terms up to O
.
However, before doing that it is worth analyzing some general
(cid:1)
features of Eq. (4).

Let us show now that vs given by Eq. (5) for SWR satisﬁes
the evolutionary conditions. The conditions say that in the co-
moving coordinate frame the velocity of the ﬂow before the
shock should be bigger than c1, while the velocity behind the
shock should be smaller than c2, i.e., M1 > 1 > M2 > 0,
where M1,2 stand for the corresponding Mach numbers. In
the laboratory coordinate frame the medium before the shock
is in the rest state with zero velocity. Accordingly, in the co-
moving coordinate frame the ﬂow velocity here is vs. Thus,
the ﬁrst evolutionary condition says vs > c1. Behind the
shock the ﬂow velocity in the laboratory frame is v2. Con-
sequently, the second condition yields vs + v2 < c2. Bearing
in mind Eq. (5) both the conditions may be written as follows

Finally, taking into account that for a simple wave and the
chosen direction of propagation the sign of derivative du/dp′
is opposite to that for (∂2V /∂p2)s [6],
i.e., for negative

u(p′) monotonically increases with

reduce inequality (6) to evident.

Let us proceed with the derivation of the generalized Burg-
ers equation. From all the above-mentioned it is clear that in

higher than O(ǫ3), after some calculations we reduce the gen-
eral equation (4) to the form of Eq. (1), where term αp′ should

Let us show that y3,4 are always real and one of these root is
smaller than y2, while the other is bigger than y1 (we remind
that by deﬁnition y1 = 0). In other words the left hand side
of Eq. (11) is negative at y2 < y < 0 and any possible values
of z and y2. To prove it note that for SWR pressure p2 must
satisfy obvious conditions pm

Due to the fact that y2 enters into Eq. (11) with a positive

For the same reason it is sufﬁcient to inspect the values of

values of Eq. (12) are negative at
polynomial (11) at y = y2 is proved in the same manner. The
proved relative position of points y1,2,3,4 guarantees that the
derivative dy/dη is negative at y2 < y < y1 for any possible
values of z and y2, i.e., the proﬁle of the steady SWR is a
monotonically decreasing function of η.

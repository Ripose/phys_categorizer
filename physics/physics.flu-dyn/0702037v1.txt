Abstract

We report the numerical simulations of the horizontal convection within

a rectangle cavity tank at high Rayleigh numbers. The physical solution

of horizontal convection depends the space resolution of the meshes. The
mesh number N is proportion to Ra1/3. The unstable numerical solutions
are obtained as N < cRa1/3. This power law also implies that the space

resolution is dominated by the viscosity and heat diﬀusion. It implies that

the special resolution is dominated by viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity but

the length of the tank. Moreover, there is a Hopf bifurcation from steady

solutions to unsteady solutions and the critical Rayleigh number Rac is
obtained as 5.53 × 108 < Rac < 5.54 × 108, which is much larger than the

formerly obtained value.

Introduction

Horizontal convection, in which the water is uneven heated at the horizontal

surface, was taken as a model of abyssal ocean circulation. Unlike the Rayleigh-

B´enard convection, the horizontal convection can be set to motion by any small

temperature gradient. Moreover, the horizontal convection yields 1/5-power

laws of Ra (e.g. Rossby, 1965; Siggers et al., 2004; Wang and Huang, 2005),

comparing with the 1/4-power laws in the Rayleigh-B´enard convection.

Similar to Rayleigh-B´enard convection, the horizontal convection may be

unsteady at high Rayleigh numbers. There is a critical Rayleigh number Rac.

The steady ﬂow is unstable and become unsteady when Ra > Rac. The un-

steady ﬂow in horizontal convection was ﬁrst found by numerically (Paparella and Young,
2002), then was observed in the experiment of Ra > 1012 (Mullarney et al.,

2004). This unsteady ﬂow is proved to be non-turbulent even as Ra → ∞,

though the ﬂow ﬁled seems to be chaotic (Paparella and Young, 2002).

However, Rac in the numerical simulation is far more lower than that in the
experiments. Paparella and Young (2002) reported 1.3×108 < Rac < 2×108 for

Pr = 1. But Rossby (1965); Wang and Huang (2005) found the ﬂow is steady
and stable for Ra < 5 × 108 in their experiments. Other numerical simulations

(Rossby, 1998; Siggers et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2006) have not found unsteady
ﬂows for Ra < 109 either. Paparella and Young (2002) explained this diﬀerence

as: (i) lower aspect ratio (H/L = 1/4) than the experiments and (ii) middle

plume forcing instead of sidewall plume forcing in the experiments. However,

their hypotheses have not been intensely investigated yet. According to the

recent numerical simulation (Sun et al., 2006), the ﬂow in a low-aspect-ratio
rectangle tank (H/L = 1/10) is still stale as Ra < 1010.

It seems that the

second reason may be more important for destabilizing the ﬂow. Above all, the

destabilization of the ﬂow is still an open problem.

On the other hand, the critical Rayleigh number, which is a critical and

fundamental value, is not obtained yet. Moreover, it is noted that the spacial

resolution is very coarse (e.g. 128×32 meshes are used) in Paparella and Young

(2002), so the more accuracy numerical simulations are needed to ﬁnd the

critical Rayleigh number. The main purpose of this paper is to ﬁnd a more

accuracy Rac, which is important for further investigation of the instability of

horizontal convection.

2 Model and Scheme

We consider the the horizontal convection ﬂows within the two-dimensional do-

main, and Boussinesq approximation is assumed to these ﬂows. The horizontal

(y) and vertical (z) regimes are 0 ≤ y ≤ L and 0 ≤ z ≤ D, respectively. Sim-

ilar to Paparella and Young (2002), the depth D is taken as reference length

scale and A = D/L denotes the aspect ratio. We use A = 1 in present work,

which is consistent with the experiments by Wang and Huang (2005). Taking

account of nondivergence of velocity ﬁled in Boussinesq approximation, the la-

grangian streamfunction Ψ and the corresponding vorticity ω are introduced.

are two important dimensionless parameter in Eq.(1), i.e. Rayleigh number

and ν are gravity acceleration, thermal expansion coeﬃcient, surface tempera-

ture diﬀerence, length of horizontal domain, thermal diﬀusivity and kinematic

viscosity, respectively.

There are two important quantity describing the circulation, i.e. the non-

dimensional streamfunction maximum and the non-dimensional heat ﬂux. The
non-dimensional streamfunction maximum Ψmax = Ψ∗

max/ν, where Ψ∗

max is the

maximum of the dimensional streamfunction. For the non-dimensional heat ﬂux

something diﬀerent from the others (e.g. Mullarney et al., 2004; Siggers et al.,

The above Eq.(1) is solved with Arakawa scheme (e.g. Arakawa, 1966;

Orlandi, 2000; Sun et al., 2006) and non-uniform grids. Comparing to the other

schemes, Arakawa scheme is more accuracy but more expensive, and it has also

been applied to horizontal convection ﬂows at high Rayleigh number (Sun et al.,

2004).

2006).

3 Results

3.1 spacial resolution

First, we test the meshes before the investigations. The boundary condition is

the same with the experiment: the surface buoyancy forcing is T = sin( π

2 y),

and no slip boundary condition is applied to walls except for surface. To test
the spacial resolution of the meshes, a case of Ra = 2 × 108 is calculated with

grids of three diﬀerent resolution, i.e. the horizontal number of meshes N = 40,

N = 64 and N = 80. We ﬁnd that the resolution of grids must be ﬁne enough,

otherwise some unphysically time-depend solutions would be obtained as Fig.1

depicts.

Fig.1a depicts the time evolution of the maximum Ψmax. The solutions

tend to be steady as time t > 1 for N = 64 and N = 80. While it becomes

time-dependent for N = 40. It implies that some unphysically time-dependent

solutions might be obtained if the spacial resolution is not ﬁne enough. To

dispel the unphysically time-dependent solutions, the numerical simulations

must have property spacial resolution which depends on the Rayleigh number

Ra. As Fig.1b shows, the number of horizontal meshes N is directly proportion
to Ra 1/3. Taking account of Ra ∝ L3, this means N ∝ L. Thus there is a

minimum special resolution for horizontal convection problems. To obtain the

physical solutions, N must be within the stable regime in Fig.1b. According to
our calculations, the ﬂow is still steady and stable for Ra ≤ 1010.

It is from Fig.1b that ∆y = L/N = CR(κν)1/3/(αT ∆T g)1/3, where ∆y

and CR = 10 are the special resolution and the coeﬃcient, respectively. The

smaller κ and ν are, the smaller the mesh is. For the molecular kinematic
viscosity κ = 1.3 × 10−3 cm2/s and thermal diﬀusivity ν = 1.5 × 10−2 cm2/s

in the case of run 16 by Wang and Huang (2005), the mesh ∆y should be
2.1 mm, which is smaller than Kolmogorov scale η = (ν3/ǫ)1/4 = 5.8 mm, where
ǫ = 2 × 10−4cm2/s is dissipation rate in the ﬁeld (Wang and Huang, 2005). So

this implies that the mesh should be ﬁne enough to resolute Kolmogorov scale

eddies.

3.2 Critical Rayleigh Number

Then we consider the horizontal convection in a rectangle tank at Pr = 1. The

tank has same aspect ratio (H/L = 1/4) and same boundary condition as that

in Paparella and Young (2002). So the surface forcing is T = [1 + cos(2πy)]/2

instead of T = sin( π

2 y). Following the way by Rossby (1965), we use horizontal

length L as length scale, so Ra = 64RaH , where RaH is the vertical Rayleigh

number by using vertical length H as unit (Paparella and Young, 2002). A ﬁne

special resolution mesh of 512 × 128 is used to eliminate numerical instability.
It is found that the critical Rayleigh number is larger than 5 × 108, which

is much lager than the result obtained by Paparella and Young (2002). Fig.2
shows the ﬂow ﬁeld and temperature ﬁeld of Ra = 5 × 108, in which the ﬂow is

symmetric, steady and stable. There is an obvious boundary near the surface

in temperature ﬁled, which leads to a 1/5-power law of Ra for heat ﬂux (e.g.

Rossby, 1965; Quon and Ghil, 1992; Siggers et al., 2004).

To ﬁnd the critical Rayleigh number, the time evolution of disturbance

φ(t) is calculated numerically. And φ(t) is assumed to satisfy φ(t) = eσtφ(0),

where σ = σr + iσi is the growth rate of disturbance.
It is found that the
critical Rayleigh number Rac is between Ra = 5.53 × 108 and Ra = 5.54 × 108.
Fig.3 shows the time evolution of disturbance at Ra = 5.53 × 108 (a) and
Ra = 5.54 × 108 (b). For Ra = 5.53 × 108, the ﬂow is stable and the growth
rate σr is approximately σr = −0.12. For Ra = 5.54 × 108, the ﬂow is unstable

and the growth rate σr is approximately σr = 0.03. Moreover, according to

Fig.3, this bifurcation is Hopf bifurcation as the solutions are periodic when

Ra > Rac.

Comparing with the results by Paparella and Young (2002), Rac is much

larger here. For that the numerical instability destabilizes the physical solution

so that the instability occurs at a relatively lower Rayleigh number.

4 Conclusion

The 1/3-power law of solution and resolution is found that unstable numerical
solutions are obtained as N < cRa1/3. It implies that the special resolution is

dominated by viscosity and thermal diﬀusion but the length of the tank. More-

over, there is a Hopf bifurcation and the critical Rayleigh number of instability
is obtained as 5.53 × 108 < Rac < 5.54 × 108, which is much larger than the

formerly obtained value.

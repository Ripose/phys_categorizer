The problem of the dynamo eﬀect for a Kraichnan incompressible helicity-free velocity ﬁeld is
considered. Exploiting a quantum formalism ﬁrst introduced by Kazantsev (A.P. Kazantsev, Sov.
Phys. JETP 26, 1031-1034 (1968)), we show that a critical magnetic Reynolds number exists for
the presence of dynamo. The value of the Prandtl number inﬂuences the spatial distribution of the
magnetic ﬁeld and its growth in time. The magnetic ﬁeld correlation length is always the largest
between the diﬀusive scale and the viscous scale of the ﬂow. In the same way the ﬁeld growth is
characterized by a time scale that corresponds to the largest between the diﬀusive and the viscous
characteristic time.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of magnetic ﬁelds generated by the turbulent motion of a charged conducting ﬂuid is relevant for several
astrophysical applications [1]. An inhomogeneous ﬂow of a charged ﬂuid is able to locally produce a magnetic ﬁeld.
The advected ﬁeld in turn generates electric currents in the ﬂuid and these dissipate the magnetic energy because of
the ﬁnite resistivity. Depending on the properties of the ﬂow, magnetic ﬁeld creation or dissipation can prevail.
To determine in general terms the presence or not of dynamo is a daunting task. However, as we will see, there are
particular models which allow for a detailed treatment.

The evolution of an initially given magnetic ﬁeld B(r, 0) in an incompressible ﬂow of a conducting ﬂuid is determined

by the following equations [1]

)B is a purely advective contribution that preserves the magnetic energy. The stretching
)v acts either as a energy source or as a sink depending on the local properties of the ﬂow. Finally, the
2B is responsible for the ohmic dissipation at small scales and balances with the inertial terms at

where v(r, t) is the velocity ﬁeld. The magnetic diﬀusivity κ, which is assumed to be uniform and constant, is
proportional to the inverse of the electric conductivity of the ﬂuid.
In Eqs. (1) the term (v
term (B

the diﬀusive scale rd.
The relative importance of the two contributions on the right-hand side of (1) is given by the magnetic Reynolds
number Rem = U L/κ, where L denotes the integral scale of the ﬂow and U is the characteristic velocity at such scale.
0 the diﬀusion dominates and
Rem can be regarded as a dimensionless measure of the ﬂuid conductivity. For Rem →
the magnetic energy density (proportional to B2) always decays to zero in time. In the opposite limit, Rem → ∞
,
the diﬀusion term is relevant only at very small scales and the magnetic ﬁeld is almost frozen in the ﬂuid. We can
expect that at high magnetic Reynolds numbers the ﬂow is able to enhance the magnetic ﬁeld, producing a consequent
growth in time of B2. The last process is called dynamo eﬀect, referring to the energy transfer from the velocity ﬁeld
to the magnetic one.
The ﬁeld B acts on the velocity by means of the Lorentz force, which yields a term proportional to (B
)B in
Navier-Stokes equations. In general, it would be necessary to take into account such feedback action on v. However,
since we are interested in understanding if the initial generation of the magnetic ﬁeld is a persistent situation or not,
we can assume for the initial conditions B2
v2 and neglect the Lorentz force contribution. Under this hypothesis
the evolution equations (1) are totally uncoupled from Navier-Stokes equations. Following this kinematic approach,
we thus proceed as if v was an assigned random ﬁeld: given the initial condition B(r, 0) and appropriate boundary
conditions, Eqs. (1) completely determine the magnetic ﬁeld evolution.

For the prescribed velocity we refer to the Kraichnan statistical ensemble [2], in which v is assumed Gaussian,
homogeneous, isotropic and δ-correlated in time. The reason for this choice is that analytical results can be obtained
[3,4]. A real turbulent ﬂow is characterized by two scales: the integral scale L and the viscous scale η, at which
the dissipation term and the transport one balance in Navier-Stokes equations. The velocity structure function is
supposed to be smooth for r
L and to approach
ξ
a constant value at scales much larger than L. The parameter ξ represents the H¨older exponent of the structure
function and can be thought of as a measure of the ﬁeld roughness: for ξ = 2 the velocity is smooth in space, while
with ξ = 0 we describe a diﬀusive ﬁeld. It is well known that the magnetic dynamo can emerge for an helical ﬂow
due to the α-eﬀect [1,5]. Here we will restrict to a parity invariant statistical ensemble, which does not give rise to

α-eﬀect.
Obviously, several generalizations of the model are possible. In Ref. [6] Schekochihin et al. describe the case of a
d-dimensional smooth velocity ﬁeld with a generic degree of compressibility. The α-eﬀect is taken into account in
Refs. [7,8] respectively in the limit of large and small Prandtl numbers. Furthermore, the eﬀect of the Lorenz force is
considered in Refs. [8,9] in the limiting case of very large Prandtl numbers.

The analysis of dynamo eﬀect is made easier by a simple quantum mechanics formulation, ﬁrst introduced by
Kazantsev [3]. Indeed, on account of the δ-correlation in time of the Kraichnan velocity ﬁeld, the single time correlation
function for the magnetic ﬁeld
can be expressed in terms of a function that satisﬁes a one-
dimensional Schr¨odinger-like equation. The problem of the dynamo eﬀect can thus be mapped into that of studying
the bound states of a quantum particle in a given potential that only depends on the velocity correlation function.
In particular, the ground state energy E0 of such potential will turn out to be the asymptotic magnetic ﬁeld growth
rate. The technique used to compute E0 for diﬀerent quantum potentials is the variation-iteration method described
in appendix A.

The aim of this paper is to single out the role that the velocity scales L and η play in dynamo theory. To this
purpose it is interesting to study the magnetic ﬁeld generation as the magnetic Reynolds number Rem and the Prandtl
number P r = ν/κ are varied (ν denotes the viscosity of the ﬂuid). Indeed, they are related to the relative importance
of the characteristic scales in the physical problem by the expressions Re

Then, we analyze the case of ﬁnite Rem and prove that a critical magnetic Reynolds number exists:
suﬃciently small, the dynamo does not ever take place, even for 1
Finally, we show that the Prandtl number does not aﬀect the presence of dynamo, but only determines the magnetic
ﬁeld correlation length and the characteristic growth time. If P r < 1, the ﬁeld B has a correlation length of order
rd and it grows with a characteristic time scale of order td. On the contrary, if P r > 1, the correlation length
is of order η and the characteristic time of order tv, where tv represents the viscous time for the velocity ﬁeld:

precisely the Kraichnan model and, following Kazantsev [3], we describe the quantum formalism mentioned above.
In particular we give the Schr¨odinger equation that is the central point of this quantum approach. In section III we
revisit the case of inﬁnite magnetic Reynolds number and zero Prandtl number. Then, starting from these results, we
analyse the eﬀect of ﬁnite Rem and we study how a nonzero P r inﬂuences the magnetic ﬁeld evolution in time.

II. THE KRAICHNAN-KAZANTSEV MODEL

In this section we recall in detail the quantum formalism introduced by Kazantsev in Ref. [3]. The random velocity
ﬁeld is assumed to be incompressible, Gaussian, homogeneous, isotropic, parity invariant, and δ-correlated in time.
Under these hypotheses it is completely deﬁned by its correlation matrix

where Sij(r) denotes the structure function of the ﬁeld v.
The δ-correlation in time of v is an essential property in order to write a closed equation for the magnetic ﬁeld
correlation function that, under a suitable transformation, reduces to a Schr¨odinger-like equation.

We impose homogeneous and isotropic initial conditions for B. Therefore, on account of the translational and
rotational invariance of Eqs. (1), the magnetic ﬁeld maintains homogeneous and isotropic statistics at every time t.
Its correlation tensor has thus the form (see, e. g., Ref. [10])

The covariance of B is then completely described by a single scalar function, e. g., its trace H(r, t) = 3 G1(r, t) +
G2(r, t). The dynamo eﬀect will correspond to an unbounded growth in time of H(r, t).
The correlation function H(r, t) can be transformed into another function Ψ(r, t) that solves the imaginary time

To study the dynamo eﬀect it is useful to put in evidence the time dependence of Ψ. As usual in quantum mechanics,
ψE(r)e−Et̺(E)dE (or
we thus expand the ‘wave function’ Ψ in terms of the ‘energy’ eigenfunctions Ψ(r, t) =

Referring to the meaning of Ψ, it is clear that an unbounded growth of the magnetic ﬁeld corresponds to the existence
of negative energies in Eq. (6). In particular, it is the sign of the ground state energy E0 that determines the presence
of dynamo and its value eventually represents the asymptotic growth rate of the magnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, in this case
it is the ground state ψE0e−E0t that dominates the growth in time.
(Recall that the negative energy levels of a
Schr¨odinger equation are always discrete).

one can easily conclude that the presence of dynamo eﬀect is equivalent to the existence of bound states for a quantum
particle of unit (r-independent) mass in the potential V (r) = m(r)U (r) [4]. Therefore, in order to state if dynamo
can take place for a given velocity ﬁeld, it is suﬃcient to study the properties of V .

R

Having summarized the quantum mechanics formalism for a magnetic ﬁeld transported by a Kraichnan turbulent
ﬂow, in the next section we study the dynamo eﬀect for a velocity correlation function that mimics the real physical
situation. In particular, we numerically compute E0 and describe the properties of the ground state eigenfunction as
Rem and P r are varied. From this analysis we are able to obtain information about the critical magnetic Reynolds
number, the correlation length of the magnetic ﬁeld, the asymptotic behaviours of its correlation function, and the
characteristic time-scale of the magnetic ﬁeld growth.

H¨older continuous function of r with exponent ξ/2. The parameter ξ thus represents a measure of the ﬁeld roughness.

For suﬃciently small ξ the potential is positive for all r, it does not generate bound states and therefore the dynamo
cannot take place. For larger ξ, V is repulsive up to r

mechanical analysis based on asymptotic behaviours (11) allows to establish that ξ = 1 is the exact threshold for the
dynamo eﬀect [4].

We have already noted that the ground state eigenfunction dominates the evolution in time and that E0 is the
asymptotic magnetic growth rate. We numerically compute ǫ0(ξ) as a function of ξ by the variation-iteration method
described in the appendix A. The quantity ǫ0 grows with ξ as shown in Fig. 1. When ξ tends to one, ǫ0 approaches
zero and the bound states disappear. In the other limit, ǫ0 reaches the value 15/2 according to the results of Kazantsev
[3]. An estimation for ǫ0 vs ξ already appears in Ref. [3], but there the results are limited to the values 1.25 < ξ < 2.
Moreover, the numerical computations in that paper are performed by a variational method based on the particular
guess r2e−βr for the eigenfunction ψE0 . This ansatz is correct for r

The smooth case is solved by Chertkov et al. in Ref. [11] by a Lagrangian approach that relates the growth rate to
the Lyapunov exponents. There is a big diﬀerence between the situation of a smooth velocity ﬁeld and one that is
just H¨older continuous. In the former case the correlation function is found to depend on the spatial coordinate as
r1/2), which implies the presence of structures with at least one dimension of
H(r, t)

objects.
Finally, the case ξ = 1 can be solved exactly. Indeed, the appropriate ground state eigenfunction of Eq. (6) is (recall

Let us analyze the situation of ﬁnite Rem (and zero Prandtl number). The principal fact is that a large scale
cutoﬀ L appears for velocity ﬁeld correlations. The diﬀusive scale rd is again within the inertial range of the velocity
ﬂuctuations, and the presence of the viscous cutoﬀ can be neglected. The velocity structure function therefore scales
as rξ for r

The main consequence of a ﬁnite Rem is that V is repulsive also at large scales. It is thus clear that, for suﬃciently
high Rem, a potential well is present at scales of order rd. On the contrary, if Rem is too small, the well can be absent
or anyway not deep enough to generate bound states (see Fig. 4). Therefore, we can conclude that for suﬃciently
small Rem, the dynamo does not take place, even for 1 < ξ < 2.
The eﬀect of a large scale cutoﬀ on the velocity energy spectrum is thus the presence of a critical Reynolds number

m . For Rem smaller than that value the potential V has not bound states or equivalently, on account of our
quantum mechanic interpretation, the velocity ﬁeld is unable to favour the magnetic ﬁeld growth and the ohmic
dissipation eventually prevails on stretching.

Finally, we consider the situation of nonzero Prandl number (at inﬁnite Reynolds number). This is equivalent to

From the previous considerations we can expect for the potential V the same asymptotic behaviours for r
as in
the case of P r = 0. Therefore, the Prandtl number does not inﬂuence the presence of dynamo. What is sensitive to
P r is the correlation length of the magnetic ﬁeld, that approximately corresponds to the scale at which the function
ψE0 begin its exponential-like decay. When P r < 1, the potential has nearly the same shape as in the case P r = 0

To conclude this section, we discuss a result that emerges from numerical computations: for P r

1 the magnetic
growth rate reaches a maximum (Fig. 6). We can easily guess this behaviour, if we refer once more to the Kazantsev
quantum formalism. For P r < 1 the ξ = 2 behaviour is practically absent in the potential V , while, when P r
4/r2 contribution at scales
approaches the value 1, the scale η begins to come into play yielding a strongly attractive
η. The ξ = 2 potential is more attractive than that of other ξ and the ground state energy increases in
rd ≪
absolute value. Then, as P r becomes larger,
decreases as explained above. In other words as long as the viscous
behaviour aﬀects only the potential shape around rd, its only eﬀect is to make the well deeper and so to favour
the dynamo. When viscousity becomes very large, the level of velocity ﬂuctuations lowers signiﬁcantly, inducing
eventually the depletion of the rate-of-growth.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The presence of dynamo eﬀect for a magnetic ﬁeld advected by a conducting ﬂuid is strongly dependent on the
properties of the turbulent ﬂow. We have highlighted in the framework of the Kraichnan ensemble the consequences of
considering a viscous and an integral cutoﬀ for the velocity. Using the quantum formalism introduced by Kazantsev,
we have found that a critical magnetic Reynolds number exists. By the same method, we have shown that the Prandtl
number is the parameter that determines the correlation length of the magnetic ﬁeld and the characteristic time of
its growth. Finally, we have argued that in the presence of dynamo the magnetic growth rate is maximum fo Prandtl
number of order unity. As already noted, the previous analysis depends only on the qualitative properties of the
velocity structure function, so we expect our conclusions to hold for a generic turbulent ﬂow with same statistical
simmetries and therefore to be relevant for real applications.

I would like to express my gratitude to A. Celani for his fundamental contribution in developing this work. A.

APPENDIX A: VARIATION-ITERATION METHOD

For the numerical analysis of Schr¨odinger equation (6) we make the transformation y = a−r (a > 1) which maps
) on the ﬁnite interval (0, 1). (The constant a should be chosen to properly resolve this interval). Eq.(6) can

of eigenvalues λ bounded from below and which extends to inﬁnity. Moreover,
is invertible on all functions twice
diﬀerentiable on (0, 1) and vanishing at the boundaries of the interval. Under these hypotheses the variation-iteration
method described in Ref. [12] provides a valuable tool to compute the lowest eigenvalue λ0 of Eq. (A1) and the
= 0 and deﬁne the
corresponding eigenfunction ψ0. Indeed, let ϕ0 be an initial trial function such that

Then, as n is increased, the sequence ϕn converges to the eigenfunction ϕ0. The nth approximation to λ0 is given by
the following variational expression employing ϕn as trial function

The set λ(n)
form a monotonic sequence of decreasing values, approaching λ0 from the above. The advantage of the
variation-iteration technique is that no expression is required a priori for the function ψ0. We only have to choose
any guess for initial function ϕ0 and then improve the result by iterating the method for suﬃciently large n. The
convergence is more rapid the smaller is the ratio between λ0 and the following eigenvalue.

Finally, for the numerical implementation of the method, we exploited the ﬁrst order discrete expression of

preserving the boundary conditions on ψ. If (0, 1) is divided in intervals of length ∆ and yi = i∆, we have

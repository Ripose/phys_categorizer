Abstract

The Navier-Stokes equations are considered by the use of the method
of Lagrangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD) over spaces with aﬃne
connections and metrics.
It is shown that the Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions appear as suﬃcient conditions for the existence of solutions of the
Navier-Stokes equations over (pseudo) Euclidean and (pseudo) Rieman-
nian spaces without torsion. By means of the corresponding (n − 1) + 1
projective formalism the Navier-Stokes equations for radial and tangential
accelerations are found.

1 Introduction

By the use of the method of Lagrangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD) [1],
[2] the diﬀerent energy-momentum tensors and the covariant Noether’s identities
for a ﬁeld theory as well as for a theory of continuous media can be found.
On the basis of the (n − 1) + 1 projective formalism and by the use of the
notion of covariant divergency of a tensor of second rank the corresponding
covariant divergencies of the energy-momentum tensors could be found. They
lead to Navier-Stokes’ identity and to the corresponding generalized Navier-
Stokes’ equations.

The general scheme for obtaining the Navier-Stokes equations for radial and

tangential acceleration could be given in the form

A Lagrangian density L can be considered in two diﬀerent ways as a tensor
density of rank 0 with the weight q = 1/2, depending on tensor ﬁeld’s compo-
nents and their ﬁrst and second covariant derivatives

(i) As a tensor density L of type 1, depending on tensor ﬁeld’s components,
their ﬁrst (and second) partial derivatives, (and the components of contravariant
and covariant aﬃne connections), i.e.

L = p−dg · L(gij, gij,k, gij,k,l, V A

The method using a Lagrangian density of type 1 is called Method of La-

By the use of the variation operator δ, commuting with the covariant diﬀer-

ential operator

δ ◦ ∇ξ = ∇ξ ◦ δ + ∇δξ

,

ξ ∈ T (M )

,

T (M ) = ∪x∈M Tx(M ) ,

we could ﬁnd the Euler-Lagrange equations.

By the use of the Lie variation operator (identical with the Lie diﬀerential

operator) £ξ, we could ﬁnd the corresponding energy-momentum tensors.

The method using a Lagrangian density of type 2 is called Method of La-

grangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD).

1.1 Euler-Lagrange’s equations

sity of type 2 in the form [3]

[3]:

(ii) Symmetric energy-momentum tensor of Belinfante sT = Ti
(iii) Variational energy-momentum tensor of Euler-Lagrange Q = Qi

2 Invariant projections of the energy-momentum

tensors

By the use of the (n − 1) + 1 projective formalism we can ﬁnd the invariant
projections of the energy-momentum tensors corresponding to a Lagrangian
ﬁeld theory or to a theory of continuous media. The idea of the projective
formalism is the representation of the dynamic characteristics of a Lagrangian
system by means of their projections along the world line of an observer and to
local neighborhoods orthogonal to this world line. The tangent vector to the
world line of the observer and its local neighborhoods determine the notion of
frame of reference [5] F r(u, τ, ξ⊥), where u is the tangent vector of the world
line, τ is the parameter of the world line, interpreted as the proper time of the
observer ξ⊥ is a contravariant vector ﬁeld, orthogonal to u. The variation of ξ⊥
determines the relative velocity and the relative acceleration between the points
at the world line and the points in the neighborhoods lying in the sub space
orthogonal to the vector u.

Let the contravariant vector ﬁeld u ∈ T (M ), g(u, u) := e 6= 0, and its

corresponding projective metrics hu and hu

hu = g −

· g(u) ⊗ g(u) ,

be given. Then the following proposition can be proved:

Proposition 1. Every energy-momentum tensor G ∼ (θ, sT , Q) could be

represented in the form [3]

G = (ρG +

· L · k) · u ⊗ g(u) − L · Kr + u ⊗ g(kπ) + ks ⊗ g(u) + (kS)g ,

1
e

where

kπ = Gπ ,

ks = Gs ,

kS = GS ,

ρG is the rest mass density, k = (1/e) · [g(u)](Kr)u, L is the pressure of
j · ∂i ⊗ dxj is the Kronecker tensor, kπ is the conductive
the system, Kr = gi
momentum density, ks is the conductive energy ﬂux density, kS is the stress
tensor [4].

3 Covariant divergency of the energy-momentum

tensors and the rest mass density

The covariant divergency δG of the energy-momentum tensor δG (G ∼ θ, sT ,
Q) can be represented by the use of the projective metrics hu, hu of the con-
travariant vector ﬁeld u and the rest mass density for the corresponding energy-
momentum tensor ρG.

δG and g(δG) can be found in the forms [3]

δG = (ρG + 1

4 Navier-Stokes’ identities and Navier-Stokes’

equations

If we consider the projections of the ﬁrst Noether identity along a non-null
(non-isotropic) vector ﬁeld u and its corresponding contravariant and covariant
projective metrics hu and hu we will ﬁnd the ﬁrst and second Navier-Stokes
identities.

From the Noether identities in the form

g(F ) + g(δθ) ≡ 0,
(θ)g − ( sT )g ≡ (Q)g,

(ﬁrst covariant Noether’s identity) ,

(second covariant Noether’s identity) ,

we can ﬁnd the projections of the ﬁrst Noether identity along a contravariant
non-null vector ﬁeld u = ui · ∂i and orthogonal to u.

Since

g(g(F ), u) = gik · gkl · Fl · ui = gl
g(g(δθ), u) = (δθ)(u)

, F = Fk · dxk,

i · Fl · ui = Fi · ui = F (u) ,

we obtain the ﬁrst Navier-Stokes identity in the form

F (u) + (δθ)(u) ≡ 0 .

By the use of the relation

g[hu(g)(F )] = g(hu[g(F )]) = hu(F )
,
g[hu(g)(δθ)] = g(hu[g(δθ)]) = hu(δθ) ,

g(hu)g = hu ,

the ﬁrst Noether identity could be written in the forms

hu[g(F )] + hu[g(δθ)] ≡ 0 ,
hu(F ) + hu(δθ) ≡ 0 .

The last two forms of the ﬁrst Noether identity represent the second Navier-

Stokes identity.

If the projection hu(F ), orthogonal to u, of the volume force F is equal to

zero, we obtain the generalized Navier-Stokes equation in the form

or in the form

hu(δθ) = 0 ,

hu[g(δθ)] = 0 .

Let us now ﬁnd the explicit form of the ﬁrst and second Navier-Stokes iden-
tities and the explicit form of the generalized Navier-Stokes equation. For this
purpose we can use the explicit form of the covariant divergency δθ of the gen-
eralized canonical energy-momentum tensor θ.

(a) The ﬁrst Navier-Stokes identity follows in the form

the ﬁrst Navier-Stokes identity could be interpreted as a deﬁnition for the change
of l2
u along the world line of the observer. The length of the non-isotropic con-
travariant vector u is interpreted as the velocity of a signal emitted or received

by the observer [6]. On this basis, the ﬁrst Navier-Stokes identity is related to
the change of the velocity of signals emitted or received by an observer moving
in a continuous media or in a ﬂuid.

(b) The second Navier-Stokes identity can be found in the form

hu[g(F )] + hu[g(δθ)] ≡

(15)

(c) The generalized Navier-Stokes equation hu[g(δθ)] = 0 follows from the
second Navier-Stokes identity under the condition hu[g(F )] = 0 or under the
condition F = 0

,

hu(a) = g(a) −

· g(u, a) · g(u) .

(16)

(17)

The second Navier-Stokes identity could be considered as a deﬁnition for the
density of the inner force. If the density of the inner force is equal to zero, i.e.
if F = g(F ) = 0, then the covariant divergency, δθ = g(δθ) of the generalized
canonical energy-momentum tensor θ is also equal to zero, i.e. δθ = g(δθ) = 0.
Then the orthogonal to the contravariant vector ﬁeld u projection of the second
Navier-Stokes identity lead to the equations

g[hu(F )] = 0 ⇔ g[hu(δθ)] = 0

.

The last equation is the Navier-Stokes equation in spaces with aﬃne connec-

tions and metrics. Now, we can prove the following proposition:

Proposition 2. The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of
the Navier-Stokes equation in a space with aﬃne connections and metrics is the

condition for the vanishing of the density of the inner force in a dynamic system
described by the use of a Lagrangian invariant L, interpreted as the pressure p
of the system, i.e. the necessary and suﬃcient condition for

is the condition

g[hu(δθ)] = 0

g[hu(F )] = 0

.

The proof follows directly from the projective second Navier-Stokes identity

g[hu(F )] + g[hu(δθ)] ≡ 0.

ξ⊥ = lξ⊥ · n⊥ ,

g(n⊥, n⊥) = ∓1 .

F⊥z is the radial inner force density and F⊥c is the tangential (Coriolis)

inner force density

F⊥z = ∓g(F⊥, n⊥) · n⊥ ,

F⊥c = g[hξ⊥(F⊥)]

,

g(F⊥z, u) = 0 ,

g(F⊥c, ξ⊥) = 0 ,

6 Conclusions

The representations of the Navier-Stokes equation in its forms for radial (cen-
trifugal, centripetal) and tangential (Coriolis’) accelerations could be used for
description of diﬀerent motions of ﬂuids and continuous media in continuous
media mechanics, in hydrodynamics and in astrophysics. The method of La-
grangians with covariant derivatives (MLCD) appears to be a fruitful tool for
working out the theory of continuous media mechanics and the theory of ﬂu-
ids in spaces with aﬃne connections and metrics, considered as mathematical
models of space-time.

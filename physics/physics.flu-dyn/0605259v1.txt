Abstract

The equations of motion in a macroscopically inhomogeneous porous
medium saturated by a ﬂuid are derived. As a ﬁrst veriﬁcation of the
validity of these equations, a two-layer rigid frame porous system con-
sidered as one single porous layer with a sudden change in physical
properties is studied. The wave equation is derived and solved for this
system. The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients are calculated nu-
merically using a wave splitting-Green’s function approach (WS-GF).
The reﬂected and transmitted wave time histories are also simulated.
Experimental results obtained for materials saturated by air are com-
pared to the results given by this approach and to those of the classical
transfer matrix method (TMM).

Introduction.—An inhomogeneous medium is one with properties that vary
with position. Inhomogeneous and layered materials can be found in many
ﬁelds of physics, for instance in optics and electromagnetism [1, 2, 3] or in
acoustics [4, 5]. Other examples are geophysical media [6], granular [7, 8] or
porous materials with depth-varying physical properties. The study of the
acoustic wave propagation in inhomogeneous porous and granular media is

engineering.

Acoustic wave propagation in ﬂuid-saturated porous media is relatively
well-known thanks to the early work of Biot [9] and to the contribution of
many researchers [10, 11, 12] since then. A porous medium can be deﬁned
as a biphasic material with a solid phase and a ﬂuid phase. This deﬁnition
encompasses sandstones, concrete, absorbing polyurethane foams, snow or
bones for example. While homogenized porous media have been extensively
studied, macroscopically-inhomogeneous porous media have received far less
attention.

In this article, acoustic propagation in ﬂuid-saturated macroscopically-
inhomogeneous porous materials is studied. It is assumed that the wave-
lengths are greater than the average heterogeneity size at the pore scale
so that the physical properties of the material are homogenized. However,
the homogenized properties can vary with the observation point within the
material at the macroscopic scale of the specimen. The equations of mo-
tion are derived from Biot’s alternative formulation of 1962 [13] in which
the total stress tensor, the ﬂuid pressure, the solid displacement and the
ﬂuid/solid relative displacement w are used. It was brieﬂy stated by Biot
[13] and conﬁrmed [14] that these variables should be employed to describe
the acoustical properties of porous media with inhomogeneous properties.
Among many possible applications, this work is a ﬁrst contribution towards
the determination of the inhomogeneity proﬁle of unknown materials by the
use of inversion methods.

The equations of motion for a macroscopically inhomogeneous medium
with elastic skeletton are derived. A ﬁrst veriﬁcation of the validity of the
proposed equations is the study of a porous material saturated by air in the
rigid frame approximation [12], i.e. when the ﬂuid is light and the solid skele-
ton therefore relatively immobile. The porous material is then considered
as an equivalent ﬂuid with frequency-dependent and depth-dependent eﬀec-
tive density and bulk modulus. In this case, a wave equation is derived and
solved numerically for a two-layer porous system treated as one single porous
medium with a sudden but continuous change in physical properties. This
provides an excellent means of comparing the proposed method (the WS-
GF method) to the results of the well established Transfer Matrix Method
(TMM) developed to calculate the acoustical properties of multilayer porous
systems [12]. The WS-GF method is applicable to any depth-dependent in-
homogeneous system and the two-layer system is just chosen for a testing
purpose. An inhomogeneity function with a shape similar to the Heavi-
side function, but which is analytical, is used. The jump with controlable
steepness is created by multiplying the parameters by the inhomogeneity
function. The thickness of the inhomogeneous medium is equal to the sum
of thicknesses of each layer.

The reﬂected and transmitted pressure ﬁelds are calculated from a known

2

incident plane wave impinging at normal incidence using a Wave Splitting-
Green’s functions approach (WS-GF) [3]. The method can be extended
to include oblique incidence by working on the appropriate component of
the wavevectors. The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients and the time
histories of the reﬂected and transmitted waves simulated with this technique
are compared to the results given by the classical transfer matrix method
(TMM) for multilayer porous materials [12]. Experimental results obtained
in a two-layer material saturated by air are compared to the simulations.

The equations of motion in an inhomogeneous poroelastic medium.—The
constitutive linear stress-strain relations in an initially stress-free, statistically-
isotropic porous medium can be written as [13]

σij = 2µǫij + δij(λcθ − αM ζ),

p = M (−αθ + ζ) ,

where σij is the total stress tensor and p the ﬂuid pressure in the pores;
δij denotes the Kronecker symbol (the summation on repeated indices is
implied); θ = ∇ · u and ζ = −∇ · w are respectively the dilatation of the
solid and the variation of ﬂuid content where u is the solid displacement
and w = φ (U − u) the ﬂuid/solid relative displacement (U is the ﬂuid
displacement); φ is the porosity; ǫij = 1
2 (ui,j + uj,i) the strain tensor of the
solid (the comma denotes spatial partial derivatives); λc = λ + α2M , where
λ, µ, M are elastic constants and α a coeﬃcient of elastic coupling. These
parameters were deﬁned by Biot and Willis [15].

Applying the momentum conservation law in the absence of body forces,

the equations of motion are written

∇·σ = ρ¨u + ρf ¨w,
−∇p = ρf ¨u + m ¨w +

η
κ

F ˙w,

where the dot and double dots notations refer to ﬁrst and second order time
derivatives, respectively; ρf is the density of the ﬂuid in the (interconnected)
pores, ρ the bulk density of the porous medium, such that ρ = (1−φ)ρs +φρf
where ρs is the density of the solid; m = ρf τ∞/φ is a mass parameter
deﬁned by Biot [13], τ∞ is the tortuosity, η the viscosity of the ﬂuid, κ the
permeability and F the viscosity correction function. This function has been
studied in detail by Johnson et al. [10] and by Allard [12].

We shall now derive the equations of motion for an inhomogeneous
porous layer or a half space whose properties vary along the depth x. The
fact that the medium is inhomogeneous is not incompatible with the fact
that it is isotropic as the inhomogeneous medium can be considered as a
superposition of an inﬁnite number of thin isotropic sub-layers of thickness
dx. Therefore, the following parameters in the above equations are now
dependent on x: λ, µ, λc, α, M , φ, ρ, m, τ∞, κ and F . The ratio η/κ is

the ﬂow resistivity and is often used instead of κ in engineering acoustics
applications. It is denoted by Rf here. The viscosity correction function F
incorporates the viscous characteristic length Λ of Johnson et al.
[10] and
the thermal characteristic length Λ′ of Champoux and Allard [16]. These
parameters also depend on x. Inserting equations (1) and (2) into equations
(3) and (4) yields the equations of motion in term of the displacements

Wave equation in a rigid frame porous medium.—The previous equations
can be applied to porous media with an elastic frame. Under the assump-
tion of a rigid frame, u = 0 and equations (1)-(4) can be simpliﬁed. The
porous medium can be considered as an equivalent ﬂuid (at the scale of the
wavelengths) described in the frequency domain by

− jωp = Ke(x, ω)∇.[φ(x) ˙U],
−∇p = jωρe(x, ω)φ(x) ˙U,

where ρe(x, ω) and Ke(x, ω) are respectively the eﬀective density and bulk
modulus of the inhomogeneous equivalent ﬂuid. Their expressions are

where γ is the speciﬁc heat ratio, P0 the atmospheric pressure and B2 the
Prandtl number. F (x, ω) and G(x, B2ω) are the well-deﬁned correction
functions of the Johnson-Allard model [10, 12]. The eﬀective density and
bulk modulus of the inhomogeneous equivalent ﬂuid are functions of the
frequency-independent parameters φ(x), τ∞(x), Rf (x) = η/κ(x), Λ(x) and
Λ′(x). These are the parameters that should be multiplied by the inhomo-
geneity function in order to account for the change in properties.

where c0 is the sound speed in air, p+ corresponds to right-going waves and

so-called Wave Splitting description, which was mainly used in scattering
problems in the time domain in electromagnetism [17] and then adapted
to the frequency domain [3]. It can be seen as a change of variables from
(p, ∂xp) to (p+, p−).

Numerical resolution of the wave equation.—The computation principle
is the following: p± are ﬁrst calculated in the surrounding homogeneous
ﬂuid at x = L. An inﬁnitely thin homogeneous layer of thickness dx is
then inserted at x = L − dx. The characteristic impedance of this layer
is the same as the characteristic impedance of the inhomogeneous material
at that point. At x = L a new set of p± are determined with the help of

(12)

(13)

(14)

equations (13). A new thin homogeneous layer is added at x = L − 2dx with
the corresponding values of ρe and Ke. Using the updated values of p± at
x = L, the pressure subﬁelds p±(L − dx, ω) are calculated. The operation
is repeated until the last inﬁnitely thin layer is added at x = 0. For each
addition of a new layer, the continuity conditions on p and φ(x) ˙U · n are
implicitely accounted for on both sides of the cumulated slab.

Green’s function approach.—The initialization of the procedure described
above requires that p± must be determined at x = L. To avoid this calcula-
tion, a Green’s function approach [17, 3] can be used. Two Green’s functions
G± are deﬁned by

∀x ∈ [0, L],

p±(x, ω) = G±(x, ω)p+(L, ω).

(15)

Green’s functions are characteristic of the sole material properties and de-
scribe the internal ﬁeld within the material. The boundary conditions at
x = L are known and are G+(L, ω) = 1 and G−(L, ω) = 0. The system of
coupled ﬁrst order linear diﬀerential equations in G± obtained by inserting
(15) in (13) can be solved numerically using a Runge-Kutta routine.

The reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients R(ω) and T (ω) are deduced

from p±

p−(0, ω) = R(ω)p+(0, ω),
p+(L, ω) = T (ω)p+(0, ω).

(16)

(17)

From these coeﬃcients, the reﬂected and transmitted waves can be simu-
lated.

In the numerical simulations, the function chosen to create the changes in
physical properties is a distribution obtained from integrating the Gaussian
normal distribution: I(x)= C(1 − erf (−(x − x0)/r)) where C is a constant,
x0 the position of the jump and r a steepness factor. The steeper is the jump
the ﬁner the stepping dx must be for better accuracy. In the simulations,
400 points were chosen to discretize the total slab and dx = 17.1/400 =
0.0428mm. The value chosen for r was r = 0.1dx. Values of r less than
this value had little eﬀect on the computed results. Smoothing the jump by
taking r = 10dx resulted in an important reduction of the signal reﬂected
at the interface between the two layers.

Experimental results - comparison with predictions.—The experimental
principle is shown in Fig. 1 where an airborne ultrasonic wave is gen-
erated and detected at normal or oblique incidence by specially designed
(ULTRAN) air-coupled transducers in a frequency range between 150 and
250kHz. The incident wave is partly reﬂected, partly transmitted and partly
absorbed in the inhomogeneous porous layer. The materials studied are
highly porous polyurethane foams saturated by air. The layers are put in
contact, not glued. The physical parameters used for each layer were deter-
mined using a previous method [18] and are displayed in Table I.

The reﬂection experiment was carried out with a single transducer used in
the pulse-echo mode [19]. Another transducer was required on the other side
of the specimen to measure the transmission. A particularly good agreement
between the experimental results and the results of the simulations is found
for the reﬂected and transmitted signals (Fig. 2(a) and 2(b)).
In Fig.
2(b), the three curves are almost indistinguishable. The waveforms were
calculated from the experimental incident waveform, which was recorded and
introduced into the simulation routines. The agreement is also very good for
the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients (Fig. 3) in the frequency range
170 − 230kHz.
In all ﬁgures, the WS-GF-curves cannot be distinguished
from the TMM-curves. The discrepancies below 170kHz and above 230kHz
in Fig. 3 are attributed to the limited bandwidth of the incident signal,
making the experimental results more sensitive to noise outside the useful
bandwidth.

Conclusion.—The equations of motion in ﬂuid-saturated inhomogeneous
porous media were derived from Biot’s second formulation of 1962 [13]. A
wave equation, valid in the rigid frame approximation, was also proposed
and solved for a two-layer system of homogeneous porous material consid-
ered as one single inhomogeneous porous layer with a sudden change in its
physical properties. The transition from the properties of the ﬁrst layer to
those of the second layer was modeled by continuous inhomogeneity function
with the shape of the Heaviside function. Excellent agreement was found
between experimental and simulated waveforms and also between their re-
spective reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients in a frequency range between
170 and 230kHz. Future developments of this work are oblique incidence
experiments and the study of other types of inhomogeneity proﬁles such as
the linear proﬁle. This work should contribute to the determination of the
inhomogeneity proﬁle of unknown materials by the use of inversion methods.

The results of an analysis of turbulent pipe ﬂow based on a Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition are
presented. The turbulent ﬂow is generated by a direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations using a spectral element algorithm at a Reynolds number Reτ = 150. This simulation
yields a set of basis functions that captures 90% of the energy after 2,453 modes. The eigenfunctions
are categorised into two classes and six subclasses based on their wavenumber and coherent vorticity
structure. Of the total energy, 81% is in the propagating class, characterised by constant phase speeds;
the remaining energy is found in the non propagating shear and roll modes. The four subclasses within
the propagating modes form a basis that provides support for the horseshoe (hairpin) structure as
the dominant, self-sustaining mechanism of turbulence.

Keywords: Direct numerical simulation, Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition, turbulence, pipe ﬂow,

1 Introduction

Turbulence, hailed as one of the last major unsolved problems of classical
physics, has been the subject of numerous publications as researchers seek to
understand the underlying physics, structures, and mechanisms inherent to the
ﬂow [1]. The standard test problem for wall-bounded studies historically has
been turbulent channel ﬂow because of its simple geometry and computational
eﬃciency. Even though much insight has been achieved through the study of
turbulent channel ﬂow, it remains an academic problem because of its inﬁnite
(computationally periodic) spanwise direction.

The next simplest geometry is turbulent pipe ﬂow, which is of interest be-
cause of its real-world applications and its slightly diﬀerent dynamics. The

Dynamical Eigenfunction Decomposition of Turbulent Pipe Flow

Table 1. Summary of existing DNS of turbulent pipe ﬂow. As seen, most ap-
proaches use a 2nd-order radial discretization. The reason is that the standard
spectral methods, in the presence of the coordinate singularity, achieve only
2nd-order convergence instead of geometric convergence.

three major diﬀerences between turbulent pipe and channel ﬂow are that pipe
ﬂow fails to conform to the logarithmic law until much higher Reynolds num-
bers (Re = 3000 for a channel versus Re = 7442 for a pipe [2, 3]), has a higher
critical Reynolds number, and is linearly stable to an inﬁnitesimal distur-
bance [4, 5]. Unfortunately, few direct numerical simulations of turbulent pipe
ﬂow have been carried out because of the complexity in handling the numeri-
cal radial singularity at the origin. Although the singularity itself is avoidable,
its presence causes standard high-order spectral methods to fail to converge
exponentially. As a result, only a handful of studies have produced turbulent
pipe ﬂow, as shown in Table 1, and typically use a low-order expansion in
the radial direction. Only Shan et al. [6] using concentric Chebyshev domains
(“piecemeal”) and Loulou et al. [7] using basis spline (B-spline) polynomials
provide a higher-order examination of turbulent pipe ﬂow. Using a spectral
element method, this study provides not only a high-order examination but
the ﬁrst exponentially convergent investigation of turbulent pipe ﬂow through
direct numerical simulation (DNS).

With this DNS result, one of the studies that can be performed with the full
ﬂow ﬁeld and time history it provides is an analysis based on an orthogonal
decomposition method. In such methods, the ﬂow is expanded in terms of
a natural or preferred turbulent basis. One method used frequently in the
ﬁeld of turbulence is Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL) decomposition, which uses a two-
point spatial correlation tensor to generate the eigenfunctions of the ﬂow.
This is sometimes referred to as proper orthogonal decomposition, empirical
orthogonal function, or empirical eigenfunction analysis.

Work in this area was pioneered by Lumley, who was the ﬁrst to use the KL
method in homogeneous turbulence [11, 12]. This method was later applied to
turbulent channel ﬂow in a series of papers by Ball, Sirovich, and Keefe [13,14]
and Sirovich, Ball, and Handler [15], who discovered plane waves and propa-
gating structures that play an essential role in the production of turbulence
through bursting or sweeping events. To study the interactions of the propagat-
ing structures, researchers have examined minimal expansions of a turbulent
ﬂow [16–18]. These eﬀorts have led to recent work by Webber et al. [19, 20],

who examined the energy dynamics between KL modes and discovered the
energy transfer path from the applied pressure gradient to the ﬂow through
triad interactions of KL modes.

This present study uses a spectral element Navier-Stokes solver to generate a
globally high-order turbulent pipe ﬂow data set. The Karhunen-Lo`eve method
is used to examine the turbulent ﬂow structures of turbulent pipe ﬂow. This
work provides a baseline understanding for future studies that can compare
the eﬀect of forcing functions on the KL structures, such as drag reduction by
spanwise wall oscillation.

2 Methodology

The direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional time dependent
Navier-Stokes equations is a computationally intensive task. By fully resolving
the necessary time and spatial scales of turbulent ﬂow, however, no subgrid
dissipation model is needed, and thus a turbulent ﬂow is calculated directly
from the equations. DNS has one main advantage over experiments, in that
the whole ﬂow ﬁeld and time history are known, enabling analysis such as the
Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition.

Because of the long time integration and the grid resolution necessary for
DNS, a high-order (typically spectral) method is often used to keep numerical
round-oﬀ and dissipation error at bay. Spectral methods and spectral elements
use trial functions that are inﬁnitely and analytically diﬀerentiable to span the
element. This approach decreases the global error exponentially with respect
to resolution, in contrast to an algebraic decrease with standard methods such
as ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite element methods [21].

2.1 Direct Numerical Simulation

2.1.1 Numerical Methods. This study uses a spectral element Navier-
Stokes solver that has been developed over the past 20 years [22,23]. This solver
employs a geometrically ﬂexible yet exponentially convergent spectral element
discretization in space, in this case allowing the geometry to be ﬁtted to a cylin-
der. The domain is subdivided into elements, each containing high-order (usu-
ally 11–13) Legendre Lagrangian interpolants. The resulting data localisation
allows for minimal communication between elements, and therefore eﬃcient
parallelization. Time discretization is done with third-order operator splitting
methods, and tensor-product polynomial bases are solved by using conjugate
gradient iteration with scalable Jacobi and hybrid Schwarz/multigrid precon-
ditioning [24].

Dynamical Eigenfunction Decomposition of Turbulent Pipe Flow

Figure 1. Cross section of the spectral element grid for pipe ﬂow. The spectral element algorithm
allows the problem to be solved in Cartesian coordinates while allowing the ﬂexibility to represent
a circular domain.

2.1.2 Geometry. Spectral elements are eﬀective in cylindrical geometries
[25] and avoid the radial singularity at the origin by solving the equations in
Cartesian coordinates. The mesh is structured as a box near the origin and
transitions to a circle near the pipe walls (Figure 1), maintaining a globally
high-order method at both the wall and the origin. In addition to avoiding
the numerical error associated with the singularity, the method also avoids
the time-step restriction due to the smaller element width at the origin of a
polar-cylindrical coordinate system, which could lead to potential violations
of the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy stability criteria.

Each slice, as shown in Figure 1, has 64 elements, and there are 40 slices
stacked in the streamwise direction, adding up to a length of 20R. Each element
has 12th-order Legendre polynomials in each direction for Reτ = Uτ R/ν=150,
τw/ρ is the shear velocity, τw is the wall shear stress, and ρ
where Uτ =
is the density. This discretization results in 4.4 million degrees of freedom.
Near the wall, the grid spacing in wall units (y+ = Uτ y/ν) is ∆r+ ≈ 0.78 and
∆θ+ ≈ 4.9, where r is the radius and θ is the azimuthal angle. Near the centre
of the pipe, the spacing in Cartesian coordinates is ∆x+ = ∆y+ ≈ 3.1. The
streamwise grid spacing is a constant ∆z+ = 6.25 throughout the domain.

Benchmarking at Reτ = 180. Benchmarking was performed at
2.1.3
Reτ = 180 with our DNS and experiments of Eggels et al. [8] and DNS of
Fukagata and Kasagi [10]. For this higher Reynolds number ﬂow, 14th-order
polynomials were used, giving grid spacings near the wall of ∆r+ ≈ 0.80 and
∆θ+ ≈ 5.0, ∆x+ = ∆y+ ≈ 3.2 in the centre, and ∆z+ = 6.42. Eggels et al. and
Fukagata and Kasagi used a spectral Fourier discretization in the azimuthal
and axial directions and then a 2nd-order ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization in the
radial direction. Also, both groups used a domain length of 10R and grid sizes

in their DNS studies of 96 × 128 × 256 for r, θ, and z directions, respectively.
The mean ﬂow proﬁles in Figure 2 correspond well, but as seen in the root-
mean-squared (rms) statistics shown in Figure 3, the spectral element calcu-
lation shows a lower peak uz,rms and higher peak uθ,rms and ur,rms. These re-
sults are in contrast to those with channel ﬂow, as reported by Gullbrand [26],
where the 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerence methods undershoot the spectral method
wall-normal velocity rms.

When compared to the experimental results of Eggels et al. [8], the spectral
element code follows much closer than the 2nd-order ﬁnite diﬀerence results.
We note that Eggels et al. report that their particle image velocimetry system
had diﬃculties capturing ur near the wall and near the centerline of the pipe
due to reﬂection, which could explain the deviation of all of the DNS results
in that area.

Figure 2. Benchmark of mean velocity proﬁle for the spectral element algorithm vs low-order
methods of Eggels et al. [8] and Fukagata and Kasagi [10] for Reτ = 180. The theoretical line is the
law of the wall u+ = y+ and the log layer u+ = 1/0.41 log y+ + 5.5. Deviations from the log layer
are expected in turbulent pipe ﬂow until much higher Reynolds numbers.

A second major diﬀerence our spectral element method and the previous
pipe DNS using 2nd-order ﬁnite diﬀerence is the domain size. With the spectral
element method, which results in a global high-order convergence, a domain
size of 10R yielded instabilities in the ﬂow, as seen in the azimuthal uθ,rms
in Figure 4 at y+ = 55 and y+ = 120. This instability would arise even with

a more reﬁned grid. When the domain of the spectral element method was
extended to 20R, this problem disappeared. We surmise that the 2nd-order
ﬁnite diﬀerence method dissipated the large-scale structures after 10R that
the higher-order spectral element case appropriately resolves. This structure,
because of the periodic boundary conditions, re-enters the inlet and causes the
unphysical bulges in the azimuthal rms proﬁle. This result is also supported by
the work of Jim´enez [27] in turbulent channel ﬂow (Reτ =180) that shows large-
scale structures that extend well past the domain size of z+ = 1800 = 10R.

This benchmark conﬁrms that the spectral element algorithm, at the given
grid resolution and domain size, will generate the appropriate turbulent ﬂow
ﬁeld and time history to perform the KL decomposition.

2.2 Karhunen-Lo`eve Decomposition

For completeness, the Karhunen-Lo`eve Decomposition method is brieﬂy de-
scribed here, but for more detail, see [11–16, 30–33].

Figure 4. Eﬀect of a short domain (10R) with a high-order method, showing unphysical deviations
in the rms proﬁles near y+ = 50 and y+ = 120 for the spectral element algorithm for Reτ = 180. A
bulge, highlighted by the red ovals, is present in the azimuthal rms that in not found in the
low-order methods of Eggels et al. [8] and Fukagata and Kasagi [10]. This is due to the more
dissipative nature of the low-order schemes that washes away a long-scale structure that the
high-order scheme captures and re-enters the inlet from the periodic outﬂow conditions. By
extending the domain to 20R, the structure is allowed to naturally decay, and the unphysical bulge
is removed.

2.2.1 Numerical Method. The two-point velocity correlation tensor is de-
ﬁned by

Kij(x, x′) = hui(x)uj , (x′)i

(1)

where u(x) is the ﬂuctuating component of the velocity and where the mean is
determined by averaging over both homogeneous planes and time. The angle
brackets represent an average over many time steps, on the order of t+ ≈
40, 000 ∼ 50, 000, to sample the the entire attractor. The i and j represent the
three orthogonal velocities, establishing the matrix of velocity correlation and
cross-correlations between every spatial point x and x′.

For turbulent pipe ﬂow, with two homogeneous directions providing trans-
lational invariance in the θ (azimuthal) and z (streamwise) direction, Eq. (1)
becomes

Kij(x, x′) = Kij(r, r′, θ − θ′, z − z′).

where κij is the Fourier transforms of Kij in the two homogeneous directions,
the ⋆ denotes the complex conjugate, and λ is the eigenvalue.

In the present problem, 2,100 snapshots of the ﬂow ﬁeld were taken, cor-
responding to one snapshot every eight viscous time steps (t+ = R+/Uτ ).
The results of each snapshot were projected to an evenly spaced grid with
101 × 64 × 400 points in r, θ, and z, respectively. The Fourier transform of
the data was then taken and the kernel built. This kernel was averaged over
every snapshot to generate the ﬁnal kernel to be decomposed. Since the di-
mension of K is 303 (given by three velocity components on 101 radial grid
points) there are 303 eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. The eigenfunctions are
ranked in descending order with the quantum number q to specify the par-
ticular eigenfunction associated with the corresponding eigenvalue. Thus, it
requires a triplet k = (n, m, q) to specify a given eigenfunction. The notation
λ(m,n,q) = λk will be adopted for the remainder of this paper.

The eigenfunctions Ψk(r) are complex vector functions and are normalised
so that the inner product is of unit length (Φk, Φl) = δkl, where δkl is the
Kronecker delta. The eigenvalues physically represent the average energy of
the ﬂow in the direction Φk,

λk = h|u, Φk|2i.

We note that the eigenfunctions, as an orthogonal expansion of the ﬂow ﬁeld,
retain the properties of the ﬂow ﬁeld, such as incompressibility andboundary
conditions of no slip at the wall.

and taking advantage of it reduces the total number of calculations as well as
the memory and storage requirements. We note that, because of its geometry,
turbulent channel ﬂow has two more symmetries – a vertical reﬂection, and a
x-axis rotation – that are not present in the pipe, since a negative radius is
equivalent to a 180 degree rotation in the azimuthal direction.

A major consequence of this symmetry is that the resulting eigenfunctions
are also symmetric, and the modes with azimuthal wave number n will be the
azimuthal reﬂection of the modes with wave number −n,

3 Results

This section presents the results of our analysis of turbulent pipe ﬂow based
on KL decomposition.

3.1 Mean Properties of Flow and Flow statistics

DNS was performed for Reτ = 150. The Reynolds number based on the centre-
line velocity is Rec ≈ 5700 and based upon the mean velocity is Rem ≈ 4300.
This range is above the critical Reynolds number for a pipe and exhibits self-
sustaining turbulence, as seen from the ﬂuctuating time history of the mean
velocity shown in Figure 5. The velocity proﬁle, seen in Figure 6, shows the
mean velocity with respect to wall units (y+ = (r − R)Uτ /ν). The proﬁle ﬁts
the law of the wall but fails to conform to the log law, and as mentioned in
Section 1, the log law is not expected for turbulent pipe ﬂow until much higher
Reynolds number.

The rms velocity ﬂuctuation proﬁles and the Reynolds stress proﬁle is shown
in Figures 7a and 7b. The streamwise ﬂuctuations peak near y+ = 16. The
azimuthal and axial velocities show a weaker peak near y+ = 39 and y+ = 55,
respectively, and then remain fairly ﬂat throughout the pipe. The Reynolds
stress vzvr has a maximum of 0.68 at y+ = 31.

function. By ordering the eigenvalues from largest to smallest, one can mini-
mize the number of eigenfunctions, N , needed to capture a given percentage
of the energy of the ﬂow,

where k = (m, n, q) is the wavenumber vector. Table 2 shows the ﬁrst 25
eigenfunctions, and Figure 8 shows the running total of energy versus modes.
The 90% mark is reached at DKL = 2, 453, where DKL can be considered as
a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the chaotic attractor describing the
turbulence as discussed by Zhou and Sirovich [17, 33]. These eigenfunctions
are the preferred or natural basis function for turbulent pipe ﬂow, and insight
is gained by observing their qualitative structure.

3.3 Structure of the Eigenfunctions

The eigenfunctions resulting from the KL decomposition can be categorised
into two distinct classes and six modes based on their characteristics, as listed
in Table 3. It is observed that certain characteristics of the eigenfunction are
dependent on the wavenumber. The modes with higher azimuthal than axial

extend from the near wall to the outer region are found.

of coherent vorticity, and a slice displaying the Reynolds stress and coherent
vorticity together. The next four subﬁgures for each class are the plots of
the eigenfunctions, both the real (b) and imaginary component (d), and the
time history amplitude (c) and phase (e). To complete the class description,
the coherent vorticity of two more representative eigenfunctions are shown in
subﬁgures (f) and (g). For the shear modes, since they do not have coherent
vorticity, only the eigenfunction and time history are plotted.

The ﬁrst subclass of interest is the wall eigenmodes. The coherent vorticity
plots of three example wall modes are seen in Figures 10a, 10f, and 10g for
the (1,5,1),(1,3,1), and (2,4,1) modes, respectively. Each mode consists of a
traveling-wave coherent vortex near the wall, and all eigenmodes with greater
spanwise wavenumber than streamwise wavenumber demonstrate this same
structure. Consistent in this subclass is the Reynolds stress generated near
the wall. The individual velocity components of the (1,2,1) mode, the most
energetic wall mode, is shown in Figures 10b and 10d for their real and imagi-
nary components, respectively, and in Figures 10c and 10a for their amplitude
squared and phase time history. The amplitude history shows the bursting
nature of these traveling-waves, and the near constant phase velocity shows
why these structures are referred to as propagating or traveling waves. These
wall functions constitute 35.22% of the total energy of the ﬂow, and are the
most energetic of the propagating modes.

The next structure of interest, still in the propagating mode class, is the lift
mode, found whenever the streamwise wavenumber is greater than or equal to
the spanwise wavenumber and the spanwise wavenumber is greater than one.

Three examples of this subclass is shown in Figures 11a, 11f, and 11g for modes
(2,2,1), (3,2,1), and (3,3,1), respectively. The coherent vorticity and Reynolds
stress start near the wall and ﬁnish near the centerline in a lifting motion. The
real and imaginary velocity components are shown in Figures 11b and 11d,
respectively, and the amplitude and phase time history in Figures 11c and
11e, respectively. Again, the constant phase speed classiﬁes these structures
as propagating modes, and the amplitude bursts are also characteristic of a
turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld. The lift structures constitutes 29.68% of the total energy
of the ﬂow.

The next structures, the asymmetric modes, are the modes responsible for
breaking the symmetry of the ﬂow about the axis of the pipe. These structures
are found for a spanwise wavenumber of one, for any streamwise wavenumber,
and consist of a coherent vortex just outside the log layer. They are asym-
metric because of their nonzero radial and azimuthal velocities at the origin,
which is physical only for azimuthal wavenumber n = 1, since a positive ra-
dial velocity at the origin, under a rotation of π around the axis, results in a
negative radial velocity. The same is true for the azimuthal velocity at the ori-
gin. Three examples of these structures are shown in Figures 12a, 12f and 12g
for modes (1,1,1), (2,1,1), and (3,1,1), respectively, again having the Reynolds
stress between the coherent vorticity. These modes are also propagating and
turbulent, as seen in the (1,1,1) mode’s amplitude (Figure 12c) and phase time
history (Figure 12e), with its real and imaginary component found in Figure
12a and 12a. This mode consistitutes 9.09% of the total energy of the ﬂow.

The last of the propagating modes is the ring mode, named for the ring of
coherent vorticity that is found for all modes with zero azimuthal wavenumber.
Examples of this structure are shown in Figures 13a, 13f, and 13g for modes
(1,0,1), (1,0,2), and (2,0,1), respectively. The real and imaginary velocities are
shown in Figures 13b and 13d, and the amplitude and phase in 13a and 13e.
This mode consistitutes 6.60% of the total energy of the ﬂow.

The last two modes are the non propagating modes. The ﬁrst and more
energetic of the two is the roll mode, found for any mode with zero streamwise
wavenumber. This consists of rolls of coherent vorticity, as seen in the three
example modes (0,6,1), (0,5,1), and (0,3,1) in Figures 14a, 14f, and 14g, re-
spectively. The Reynolds stress is strong between the coherent vortices but is
an order of magnitude less than those of the wall or lift structures. The veloc-
ity components of the (0,6,1) mode are shown in Figure 14b and 14d. Of note,
these structures do not have a constant phase velocity, seen in Figure 14e, and
the decay rate of the energy is slower than that of the propagating modes,
seen if Figure 14c. This subclass consistitutes 18.34% of the total energy of
the ﬂow.

The other non propagating mode is the shear mode, found for zero azimuthal
and streamwise wavenumber. This mode corresponds to the ﬂuctuation of the

January 21, 2014

mean ﬂow rate. Since these structures have no coherent vorticity nor imaginary
components, only the real velocity components (Figures 15a and 15c) and their
amplitude and phase time history (Figures 15b and 15d) are plotted. Like the
roll modes, the shear modes do not have a constant phase velocity, and since
they do not have an imaginary component, the phase oscillates between zero
and π. The shear modes constitute 1.08% of the total energy of the ﬂow.

The energy spectra of the propagating mode subclasses are shown in Figure
16. This shows that the tail end of the inertial range is populated primarily
by the lift modes and the low end of the spectra is populated predominantly
by the wall modes.

The eﬀect of higher radial quantum number q > 1 is more zero crossings of
the velocities in the radial direction. The eﬀect on the coherent vorticity and
the number of vortex cores scales with the radial quantum number q. The wall
and lift modes retain their characteristics, in that even with more vortices,
they remain close to the wall for the wall mode and close to the centreline for
the lift modes, shown in Figures 17a through 18b.

4 Discussion

Although the Karhunen-Lo`eve method yields a preferred or natural basis for
turbulence, one must be careful in the conclusions drawn from the results, as
any structure or feature can be reconstructed from any given orthogonal basis.
This work is reported as a foundation for further study to examine how these
eigenfunctions change with global changes in the ﬂow, such as relaminarization
and drag reduction by spanwise wall oscillation. Nevertheless, there are three
interesting results that do not require comparisons to other simulations.

The ﬁrst is the constant phase speed of the propagating modes. This was
also found in studies of turbulent channel ﬂow, as the structures represented
by the basis advect with a constant group velocity, the same velocity as burst
events [13–15]. The normal speed locus of the propagating waves is shown
in Figure 19 for the propagating modes found in the top 50 most energetic
modes. For this, the phase speed ω/kkk is plotted in the direction k/kkk. The
locus is nearly circular, which is evidence that these structures propagate as
a wave packet or envelope that travels with speed of 8.41, the point at which
the circle intersects the y-axis in Figure 19.

The second interesting result is that none of the modes with azimuthal wave
number n = 1 exhibit any traveling waves near the wall, and are without
exception a streamwise or inclined streamwise vortex in the outer region. The
reason is that the n = 1 mode does not allow for a near-wall traveling wave [28],
and as such, the basis expansions for these modes have only near-centreline
structures.

The third result of note is that the diﬀerent structures, as observed by the KL
decomposition, can be seen qualitatively as an expansion that represents the
horseshoe (hairpin) vortex representation of turbulent structures. This horse-
shoe structure is supported by a large number of researchers in the turbulence
community as the self-sustaining mechanism for turbulence [29]. In the repre-
sentative horseshoe structure (see, for example, the ﬁgure by Theodorsen [34]),
the structures found in the KL can be seen. The wall modes represent the leg
structure and its perturbation near the wall. The lift modes represent the
structure lifting oﬀ the wall. The asymmetric modes represent the secondary
and tertiary horseshoes that are formed. The turn modes represent the span-
wise head of the horseshoe. As mentioned before, since the KL decomposition
forms a basis, any ﬂow can be recreated from these eigenmodes, so this result
is reported as an interesting qualitative result, and as an understanding that
the propagating modes are the structures of interest in turbulence.

5 Conclusions

We have presented the use of the Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion method with the
results of a globally high-order direct numerical simulation of turbulent pipe
ﬂow. The results reveal the structure of the turbulent pipe ﬂow as propagat-
ing (80.58% total energy) and non propagating modes (19.42% total energy).
The propagating modes are characterised by a constant phase speed and have
four distinct classes: wall, lift, asymmetric, and ring modes. These propagat-
ing modes form a traveling wave envelope, forming a circular, normal-speed
locus, with advection speed of 8.41. Together, the propagating structures as a
basis represent well the horseshoe vortex structure as the prevalent turbulent
structure. The non propagating modes have two subclasses: streamwise roll
and shear modes. These represent the energy storage and mean ﬂuctuations
of the turbulent ﬂow, respectively. This eigenfunction expansion, using both
their structure and their time-dependent coeﬃcients, provides a framework
for further analysis and comparison and has led to understanding the mecha-
nism of drag reduction by spanwise wall oscillation [35] and the mechanism of
relaminarization [36].

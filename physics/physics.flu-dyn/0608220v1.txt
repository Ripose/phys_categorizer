The separation between molecular and mesoscopic length and time scales poses a severe limit
to molecular simulations of mesoscale phenomena. We describe a hybrid multiscale computational
technique which address this problem by keeping the full molecular nature of the system where it is
of interest and coarse-graining it elsewhere. This is made possible by coupling molecular dynamics
with a mesoscopic description of realistic liquids based on Landau’s ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics. We
show that our scheme correctly couples hydrodynamics and that ﬂuctuations, at both the molecular
and continuum levels, are thermodynamically consistent. Hybrid simulations of sound waves in bulk
water and reﬂected by a lipid monolayer are presented as illustrations of the scheme.

Complex multiscale phenomena are ubiquitous in na-
ture in solid (fracture propagation [1]), gas (Knudsen lay-
ers [2]) or in liquid phases (ﬂuid slippage past surfaces
[3], crystal growth from ﬂuid phase, wetting, membrane-
ﬂuid dynamics, vibrational properties of proteins in wa-
ter [4, 5] and so on). These phenomena are driven by
atomistic forces but manifest themselves at larger, meso-
scopic and macroscopic scales which cannot be resolved
by purely large scale molecular simulations (with some
notable exceptions [6]). On the other hand, coarse-
grained mesoscopic models have limited use due to the
approximations necessary to treat the molecular scales
intrinsic to these methods. A viable solution to this
dilemma is represented by multiscale modelling via cou-
pled models, a protocol which is also well suited to new
distributed computing paradigms such as Grids [7, 8].
The idea behind this approach is simple: concurrent, cou-
pled use of diﬀerent physical descriptions.

The coupled paradigm is the underlying concept in
quantum-classical mechanics hybrid schemes [1] used to
describe fracture propagation in brittle materials and also
in hybrid models of gas ﬂow [2]. During the last decade,
hybrid modelling of liquids has received important con-
tributions from several research groups (see the recent
review [9]). However, it has thus far lacked the maturity
to become a standard research tool for liquid and soft
condensed matter systems. Hybrid simulations of liq-
uids have been restricted to coarse-grained descriptions
based on Lennard-Jones particles, reducing the major
advantage of this technique of maintaining full molec-
ular speciﬁcity where needed. Recently, new methods for
energy controlled insertion of water molecules [10] have
ﬁnally opened the way to real solvents such as water. So
far, no hybrid method has employed an accurate descrip-
tion of the mesoscale (from nanometres to micrometres)
as the important contribution of ﬂuctuations has been
neglected in the embedding coarse-grained liquid. The
hybrid method must also ensure thermodynamic consis-
tency, by allowing the open molecular system to relax to
an equilibrium state consistent with the grand canonical

ensemble [11]. Finally, all previous non-equilibrium hy-
brid simulations have been restricted to shear ﬂow [9, 12].
In this Letter, we present a coupled multiscale model
called “hybrid MD” for simulation of mesoscopic quanti-
ties of liquids (water) embedding a nanoscopic molecular
domain (Fig. 1a). Hybrid MD overcomes the limitations
of previous hybrid descriptions of liquids by coupling ﬂuc-
tuating hydrodynamics [13] and classical molecular dy-
namics via a protocol which guarantees mass and momen-
tum conservation. The present method is designed to ad-
dress phenomena driven by interplay between the solute-
solvent molecular interaction and the hydrodynamic ﬂow
of the solvent.

Fluctuating hydrodynamics model. Our mesoscopic de-
scription of ﬂuid ﬂow is based on the equations of ﬂuc-
tuating hydrodynamics (FH) [13]. These equations are
stochastic partial diﬀerential equations which reduce to
the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit of large volumes.
The equations are based on the conservation equations
∂tφ = −∇J φ, where φ = φ(r, t) is the density of any
conserved variable at location r. We consider an isother-
mal ﬂuid, so that the relevant variables are the mass and
momentum densities φ = {ρ, g} (here g ≡ ρv and v
is the ﬂuid velocity). The mass and momentum ﬂuxes
are given by J ρ = ρv and J g = ρvv + Π +
Π, where
Π and
Π are the mean and ﬂuctuating contributions
to the pressure tensor, respectively. The mean pressure
tensor is usually decomposed as Π = (p + π)1 + ΠS,
where p is the thermodynamic pressure (given by the
equation of state) and the stress tensor is the sum of a
traceless symmetric tensor ΠS and an isotropic stress
π. We consider a Newtonian ﬂuid for which ΠS
αβ =
, π = −ζ∂γvγ, where
−η
repeated indices are summed, D the spatial dimension
(cid:1)
and η, ζ are the shear and bulk viscosities respectively.
The components of the ﬂuctuating pressure tensor
Παβ
are random Gaussian numbers (see supplementary infor-
mation).

Our continuum mesoscopic model is based on a ﬁnite
volume discretization of the FH equations [14], although

here in an Eulerian frame of reference and on a regular
lattice. Partitioning the space into several space-ﬁlling
volumes Vk with k = 1, ..., N centered at positions rk, we
integrate the conservation equations over each volume Vk
and apply Gauss’ theorem d

ekl, where ekl is the unit surface vector pointing towards
cell k, and Akl is the surface area connecting cells k and
l. We then derive the following stochastic equations for
mass and momentum exchange:

To close the discrete conservation equations we have to
devise a discretization of the dissipative and ﬂuctuat-
ing parts which ensures the validity of the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem. By choosing the discretization of
the gradients ∂αφk →
klφk/(2Vk), the discrete
momentum ﬂuxes Πk and d
Pk take the form given in
[14] (see also supplementary information). The resulting
set of stochastic diﬀerential equations Eqs. (1,2) may be
integrated using various stochastic integration schemes
[15]; in this work we have used a simple Euler scheme.

Molecular

dynamics.

The molecular descrip-
tion is based on classical molecular dynamics and
the CHARMM27 forceﬁeld (incorporating the TIP3P
parametrization) which speciﬁes bond, angle, dihe-
dral and improper bonded interactions and non-bonded
Lennard-Jones 6-12 and Coulomb interactions. The code
is derived from a stripped down version of NAMD [16].
We use a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermo-
stat [17] ensuring local momentum conservation in such
a way that hydrodynamic modes are not destroyed.

Coupling protocol.- In our computational implementa-
tion, the MD and FH components are independent cou-
pled models [8] which exchange information after every
ﬁxed time interval ∆tc. We set ∆tc = nF H ∆t = nMDδt,
where ∆t and δt are the FH and MD time steps and,
nF H and nMD are integers which depend on the system
being modeled; e.g.
for water as solvent ∆tc = 100 fs,
nF H = 10 and nMD = 100. Conservation is based on
the ﬂux balance: both domains receive equal but oppo-
site mass and momentum ﬂuxes across the hybrid inter-
face. This interface (H) uniquely deﬁnes the total sys-
tem (MD+FH, see Fig. 1b) and, importantly, the total
quantities to be conserved. This contrasts with previ-
ous schemes [9] where particle and continuum domains
intertwine within a larger overlapping region, preventing
a clear deﬁnition of the system.

FIG. 1: The set-up used for our hybrid molecular simula-
tions (a) and a close-up of the hybrid interface (b). The
ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics description (FH), resolved by the
ﬁnite volume method, is coupled to a molecular model (MD)
representing a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid
monolayer solvated with water and restrained at the lipid
head groups. We indicate by “P” and “C” respectively the
particle and continuum cells adjacent to the hybrid interface
“H”. The buﬀer region of the MD system “B” (overlapping
the C cell) is indicated by translucent water molecules and
the water molecule density in the buﬀer region is shown in
(c).

Note that J g
C involves the evaluation of the discretized
velocity gradient at C, and thus requires the mass and
momentum of the MD system at the neighbouring P
cell averaged over the coupling time ∆tC : hMP i∆tc and
hPP i∆tc , respectively (see Fig. 1b). On the other hand,
the momentum ﬂux tensor at the P cell can be com-
puted for the microstate using the kinetic theory formula

[18] being the contribution of atom i to the virial. Al-
ternatively, J g
P can be computed by introducing the
coarse-grained variables at the neighboring MD and FH
cells into the discretized Newtonian constitutive relation.
Both approaches provide equivalent results in terms of
mean and variance of the pressure tensor.

molecular system, we extend the MD domain to an ex-
tra buﬀer cell (“B” in Fig. 1b). Particles are free to
cross the hybrid interface according to their local dy-
namics, but any atom that enters in B will experience
an external force −FH /NB which transfers the external
pressure and stress. The number of solvent molecules at
the buﬀer NB(t) is controlled by a simple relaxation al-
gorithm: ∆NB = (hNBi − NB)∆tc/τB, with τB ≃ 500 fs.
The average hNBi is set so as to ensure that B always con-
tains enough molecules to support the momentum trans-
fer; here we use hNBi = 0.75MC/m, where MC is the
mass of the continuum cell C and m the molecular mass.
Figure 1c shows the equilibrium number density proﬁle

of water at the buﬀer. Importantly, the density proﬁle
is ﬂat around the hybrid interface. Due to the external
pressure, it quickly vanishes near the open boundary. In
fact, molecules eventually reaching this rareﬁed region
in B are removed.
If the relaxation equation requires
∆NB > 0, new molecules are placed in B with veloc-
ities drawn from a Maxwellian distribution with mean
equal to the velocity at the C cell. The insertion loca-
tion is determined by the usher algorithm [10], which
eﬃciently ﬁnds new molecule conﬁgurations releasing an
energy equal to the mean energy per molecule. Momen-
tum exchange due to molecule insertion/removal is taken
into account in the overall momentum balance [11].

In ﬂuid dynamics the mass ﬂux is not an independent
quantity but is controlled by the momentum ﬂux [see
Eqs.
(1) and (2)]. Consequently, we do not explicitly
impose the mass ﬂux on the MD system. Instead it arises
naturally from the eﬀect of the external pressure on the
molecule dynamics near the interface. The mass ﬂux J ρ
H ·
e⊥ is thus measured (via simple molecule count) from
the amount of MD mass crossing the interface H over
the coupling time ∆tc. The opposite of this ﬂux is then
transfered to the adjacent C cell via a simple relaxation
algorithm [11], using a relaxation time (τr ≥ O(100) fs)
large enough to preserve the correct mass distribution at
the C cell, but still much faster than any hydrodynamic
time. This guarantees mass conservation.

Results. We ﬁrst test the conservation of the total
mass M and momentum P . Results are shown in Fig.
2a, where we consider the equilibrium state of a hybrid
MD simulation of water in a 3D periodic box 50×50×735
3
˚A
). The embedded TIP3P
water domain (including the buﬀers) is 75˚A wide in the
coupling (z) direction and was pre-equilibrated at 1 atm
and 300K. Figure 2a shows the mean error in mass and
momentum conservation. As stated above, mass conser-
vation is ensured over a short time ∆tc ∼ O(100) fs, as
clearly reﬂected in Fig. 2a. However, as the external
force is imposed within the buﬀers B, the momentum
conservation is ensured only on the “extended” system
(MD+FH+B). The variation of momentum of the to-
tal system (MD+FH) is then a small bounded quantity
whose time average becomes smaller than the thermal
noise after about 1ps (see Fig. 2a), i.e, faster than any
hydrodynamic time scale.

The FH description uses an accurate interpolated
equation of state p(ρ) = (3.84 − 15.7ρ + 15.3ρ2) 104 bars,
which ﬁts for ρ = [0.54, 0.70] g/mol/A3 the outcome of
N P T simulations of TIP3P water at T = 300K and pro-
vides quasi-perfect match of the mean pressure, density
(see Fig. 2b) and sound velocity. The shear and bulk
viscosities of the FH model are assigned to match those
of the MD ﬂuid (for water at T = 300K we used those
reported in Ref. [19]). Also, in cases where the viscosity
varies locally, the FH model allows one to assign a dif-
ferent viscosity for each cell. Momentum ﬂuctuations at

each cell are consistently controlled by the DPD thermo-
stat in the MD region, and via the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
balance in the FH domain. Density ﬂuctuations present a
much more stringent test of thermodynamic consistency.
Each ﬂuid cell is an open subsystem so, at equilibrium, its
mass ﬂuctuation should be governed by the grand canon-

ical (GC) prescription: σ[ρ] = [ρkBT /(Vkc2
(where σ means standard deviation and c2
T ≡ (∂P/∂ρ)T
is the squared sound velocity at constant temperature).
Mass ﬂuctuations within the MD and FH cells are both
in agreement with the GC result (Fig. 2b) indicating
that neither the usher molecule insertions [10] nor the
mass relaxation algorithm substantially alter the local
equilibrium around the interface H.

We now focus on transmission of sound waves which
thus far have remained an open problem in the hybrid
setting.
In a slot of water between rigid walls we per-
turb the equilibrium state with a Gaussian density per-
turbation (amplitude 5% and standard deviation 45˚A).
As shown in Fig. 3a the resulting travelling waves cross
the MD domain several times at the center of the slot.
Sound waves require fast mass and momentum transfer
as any signiﬁcant imbalance would generate unphysical
reﬂection at the hybrid interface. No trace of reﬂection is
observed and comparison with full FH simulations shows
statistically indistinguishable results.

Finally, we validate the hybrid scheme against full MD
simulations of complex ﬂuid ﬂow (set-up Fig. 1a). A
sound wave generated by a similar Gaussian perturbation
is now reﬂected against a lipid monolayer (DMPC) (Fig.
3b). Each lipid is tethered by the heavy atoms of the po-
lar head group with an equilibrated grafting cross-section
2
of 53 ˚A
/lipid, close to the experimental cross-section
of membranes. In the hybrid simulation, the MD water
layer close to the lipid membrane extends just 45˚A above

ered a large 180×50×50 ˚A
box of explicit water contain-
ing around 50K atoms. The wave velocity near the layer
is compared in Fig. 3b for the hybrid MD and MD simu-
lations. The excellent agreement demonstrates that the
coupling protocol accurately resolves features produced
by the molecular structure. In Fig. 3b such eﬀects are
due to sound absorption by the lipid layer, highlighted
by comparison with a FH simulation of the same wave
impinging against a purely reﬂecting wall. The present
sound waves simulations were done assuming an isother-
mal environment. This is realistic if the rate of thermal
relaxation DT k2 (with DT ∼ 1.5 × 10−7m/s2 the water
thermal diﬀusivity and k = 2π/λ the wavenumber) is
comparable with or faster than its sound frequency c k.
The present simulations λ ∼ 50˚A are just in the limit
of the isothermal sound regime [21], while waves with
λ > O(10)˚A propagate adiabatically and require consid-
eration of the energy ﬂow [11].

In summary, we have presented a stable and robust
multiscale method (hybrid MD) for the simulation of the
liquid phase which embeds a small region, fully described
by chemically accurate molecular dynamics, into a ﬂuc-
tuating hydrodynamics representation of the surrounding
liquid. Mean values and ﬂuctuations across the interface
are consistent with hydrodynamics and thermodynamics.
Sound waves propagating through the MD domain and
ﬂow behavior arising from the interaction with complex
molecules are both treated correctly. We considered wa-
ter waves reﬂected by DMPC monolayers, but the scope
of this methodology is much broader, including inter alia
the study of vibrational properties of hydrated proteins
(via high frequency perturbations) [4, 5], the ultrasound
absorption of complex liquids [20] or the simulation of
quartz crystal oscillators [22] for the study of complex

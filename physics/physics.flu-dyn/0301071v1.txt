Large scale features of a randomly isotropically forced incompressible and unbounded rotating
ﬂuid are examined in perturbation theory. At ﬁrst order in both the random force amplitude and
the angular velocity we ﬁnd two types of modiﬁcations to the ﬂuid equation of motion. The ﬁrst
correction transforms the molecular shear viscosity into a (rotation independent) eﬀective viscosity.
The second perturbative correction leads to a new large scale non-dissipative force proportional to
the ﬂuid angular velocity in the slow rotation regime. This eﬀective force does no net work and
alters the dispersion relation of inertial waves propagating in the ﬂuid. Both dynamically generated
corrections can be identiﬁed with certain components of the most general axisymmetric “viscosity
tensor” for a Newtonian ﬂuid.

I. INTRODUCTION

The special features of turbulence in the presence of rotation have attracted the interest of many authors [1–4].
Relying on some experiments, the methods of study used have ranged from analytic approaches to numerical simula-
tions [2,5–7]. The central theme in rotating ﬂuids is the eﬀect of the Coriolis force, which induces anisotropy (there is
a preferred direction, that of the rotation axis). This anisotropy is extreme in the limit of fast rotation, which actu-
ally forces the ﬂow to become two-dimensional (Proudman-Taylor theorem) [1]. In this work we apply perturbation
theory to the randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation with Coriolis force as a model for the turbulent regime of a
rotating ﬂuid. The perturbative study of the ordinary randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation, in combination with
the renormalization group (as an improvement of perturbation theory), has a long tradition [8–10].

The addition of the Coriolis force, induced by the rotation of the ﬂuid, introduces one additional parameter, the
angular velocity Ω or, in dimensionless form, either the Rossby or Ekman numbers (in addition to the Reynolds
number) [1]. Let us focus on the Ekman number, Ek = ν/(ΩL2), that depends on the viscosity ν and a scale L,
roughly associated with the size of the ﬂuid system. The Ekman number gives the relative importance of the viscosity
and Coriolis forces. We will assume henceforth that for small Ω (< ν/L2) the turbulence is isotropic and the only
relevant parameter is the viscosity. In this limit, the results of the study of the ordinary randomly forced Navier-Stokes
equation hold (the random force is always assumed isotropic).

For larger Ω we will encounter new features. In fact, the only restriction on perturbative correction terms is that
they respect the basic symmetry of the equations, in our case, the axial symmetry about the rotation axis. We will
see that perturbation theory generates new terms fulﬁlling these symmetry constraints. Therefore, one must ﬁnd the
complete set of allowed terms that can arise in perturbation theory. We will determine all the terms that can be
represented by the components of an axisymmetric “viscosity tensor” and, in particular, the ones that arise at ﬁrst
order in perturbation theory. The part of this “viscosity tensor” that is pair-antisymmetric in the indices plays a
signiﬁcant role; however, it does not lead to dissipation, and therefore, is not truly viscous.

As in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, we assume that the physical region of study is suﬃciently far from the
surfaces, where the boundary conditions are imposed, for them not to have any direct eﬀect, except the presence of
the scale L. In contrast to ordinary turbulence, this condition only implies that we can have homogeneous turbulence
but, due to rotation, it cannot be isotropic. It is pertinent to mention here that the possibility of anisotropic forced
turbulence, and precisely with axial symmetry, has already been considered [11].
In this reference, however, the
authors assume that the breakdown of isotropy occurs through a random force whose two-point correlation function
depends on the anisotropy vector ~n. They derive a renormalized force proportional to second and fourth powers of ~n.
In our case, we will see that the ﬁrst perturbative correction is linear in ~Ω, like the Coriolis force itself.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the randomly forced hydrodynamical equations with
rotation. We assume that the ﬂuid is incompressible and show how to formulate them as a problem of homogeneous
but anisotropic incompressible turbulence. Fourier analysis of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld is used to organize the
perturbation expansion [10] in Subsection II B. We introduce in Subsection II C the linear response function. Unlike the
isotropic case, the Coriolis term leads to a non-symmetric linear response function matrix. In Subsection II D we deﬁne
the non-linear response function and present its perturbative expansion (slow rotation). We also compute the ﬁrst

1

order perturbative correction to the response function, which allows the identiﬁcation of the (rotation independent)
eﬀective shear viscosity (proportional to the cube of the Reynolds number), and a new anisotropic force. In Section III
we write down the most general axially symmetric “viscosity tensor”, as the existence of a preferred direction, singled
out by the ﬂuid rotation, requires the introduction and use of axisymmetric tensors. This rank four “viscosity
tensor” expresses the proportionality between the ﬂuid stress tensor and the rate of strain tensor. In isotropic and
homogeneous incompressible turbulence, the viscosity tensor depends only on one parameter, the ﬂuid shear viscosity.
In the case of rotating turbulence, and for slow rotation, we ﬁnd that the axisymmetric “viscosity tensor” depends
on two parameters: the molecular shear viscosity (coming from the isotropic terms of the “viscosity tensor”) and a
new one, that arises from the anisotropic terms in the “viscosity tensor”. We also show that this new parameter
can be identiﬁed as the coeﬃcient of the anisotropic force calculated perturbatively (in the previous Section II D).
Having thus established the equivalence between the perturbatively corrected randomly forced Navier-Stokes equation
with Coriolis force on the one hand, and a (Newtonian) rotating incompressible ﬂuid with an eﬀective axisymmetric
“viscosity tensor” on the other, we proceed, in Section IV, to discuss some physical consequences of the new terms
in the perturbed ﬂuid equations. In Subsection IV A we consider the quasi-local force induced by the anisotropic
components of the “viscosity tensor” and show that it is proportional to the cube of the Reynolds number, and that
it does not lead to dissipation. In Subsection IV B we study the dynamical eﬀects of this force on the propagation of
inertial waves. We end by discussing our results and proposing further work on the problem of rotating turbulence.
In Appendix A we introduce the diagrammatic representation of the exact Navier-Stokes equation and the diagram
encoding the ﬁrst order correction to the response function and in Appendix B we present the technical details needed
to carry out the perturbative calculation in the slow rotation limit.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS AND PERTURBATION THEORY

A. Equations of motion with random force in a rotating frame

We start from the hydrodynamical equations for a ﬂuid with density ﬁeld ρ(x, t), velocity ﬁeld u(x, t), pressure
p(x, t), and molecular shear (tangential) and bulk kinematic viscosities ν and κ, respectively. We assume that the
ﬂuid is rotating with constant angular velocity Ω along the ˆz axis and that it is subject to an isotropic random forcing
per unit mass f . The mass and momentum conservation equations are

(cid:19)(cid:21)

where d is the number of space dimensions. The dimension of space d will be kept as a free variable, although when
we consider rotation-dependent expressions, these must be evaluated for d = 3. The momentum equation (1b) is
supplemented with a random stirring force that leads to a statistical distribution for the velocity ﬁeld and can be used
to model turbulent ﬂows just as is done for isotropic randomly stirred (non-rotating) turbulence [8,10]. Regarding
the random force spectrum and statistics, we take a Gaussian random force that is white in time, for simplicity, but
we allow for (translation invariant) spatial correlations. So we can write

hfi(~x, t)i = 0

and

hfi(~x, t)fj(~x′, t′)i = Dij(~x − ~x′)δ(t − t′) ,

where the angular brackets denote an average over the random force realizations. The spectral function for Dij(~x)
will be speciﬁed below.

We assume that the ﬂuid is incompressible so that the density ﬁeld is constant (ρ(~x, t) = ρ0) and ~∇ · u = 0. Under

this condition we need only consider the equation for the conservation of momentum (1b) and write

Notice that the force per unit mass f will be taken solenoidal as well, that is ~∇ · f = 0, in order to avoid having a
random component in the pressure.

In the absence of random stirring particular solutions of Eq. (3) are well known (for an incompressible ﬂuid):
it
admits plane wave solutions, called inertial waves [1,12,13]. These are exact solutions of the non-linear equations, but

We now proceed to eliminate the gradient term of Eq. (3) by making use of the incompressibility condition [10].

so that the pressure p∗ can be eliminated from Eq. (3) by writing

where, following standard practice, we have introduced the constant λ in front of the advective term for book-keeping
purposes [8] (λ will be useful when carrying out the perturbation expansion and is to be set to one afterwards). The
projection operator P is given by

and ensures that the non-linear and Coriolis terms are solenoidal. In Eq. (6), if u is solenoidal so is f and vice versa.
Unlike Eqs. (1b) or (3), Eq. (6) is translation invariant. That is, the centrifugal term in (1b) clearly distinguishes
the origin (x = 0) as a special point; but as we have seen in Eq. (5) we can include this term into the generalized
pressure and eliminate p∗ from the equation. This yields Eq. (6) in which a preferred direction (but no preferred
point) is singled out by the angular velocity. This latter equation is invariant under translations, hence, we can make
use of the Fourier transform. Since in Fourier space

P = 1 − ~∇

~∇· ,

1
∇2

Pij(k) = δij −

,

Eq. (6) only contains vectors orthogonal to k and we may refer to this equation as the transverse Navier-Stokes
equation.

We choose the random force spectrum (2) as follows:

hfi(~k, ω)i = 0

and

hfi(~k, ω)fj(~k′, ω′)i = (2D)k−y(2π)d+1Pij(k) δ(ω + ω′) δd(~k + ~k′) ,

(9)

where k = |~k|, D > 0 is a measure of the amplitude of the random force and the real exponent y > −2 characterizes
the random force spectrum [9]. When y = d the velocity correlations produce an energy spectrum resembling the
Kolmogorov spectrum. The random force acts isotropically on the ﬂuid, thus, whatever anisotropies emerge at large
scale must be due to the Coriolis force. In the following Sections we analyse the nature of the anisotropies by solving
Eq. (6) in perturbation theory.

B. The Fourier transformed equation

In what follows we use the Fourier transformed equation of motion (6). Our convention for the Fourier transform

is given by

We have introduced a wave-number cut-oﬀ Λ, so that the integral over ~k is restricted to the values |~k| < Λ. The inverse
of this cut-oﬀ, 1/Λ, can be associated with the dissipation (Kolmogorov) scale, and we assume that 1/Λ ≪ L [9].

In order to write the Navier-Stokes Eq. (6) in wave-number representation we transform the u ﬁeld according

to (10), apply convolution to the non-linear term, and invert the Fourier transform to obtain

This equation, but without the Coriolis term, is a familiar expression in turbulence research [8–10]. Eq. (11) can be
iterated to any desired order in λ and will serve as the starting point for constructing the perturbation expansion,
which is considered in the following Subsection.

C. The linear response function

If we “shut-oﬀ” the non-linear terms (proportional to λ) in (11) we can identify the (inverse) linear response

function, which will be used in carrying out the perturbative calculation. Thus, setting λ = 0 in Eq. (11) we have

(−iω + νk2)u(0)

(~k, ω) + Pij(k)(2Ω ∧ u(0))j = fi(~k, ω) ,

i

where u(0) is the linear velocity ﬁeld. The previous equation can be written as

[G0(~k, ω)]−1u(0)(~k, ω) = f (~k, ω) ,

which deﬁnes the linear (inverse) response function matrix, and allows one to solve for the linear velocity ﬁeld
u(0)(~k, ω). In the next Subsection we calculate the perturbative corrections to the linear inverse response function
due to the existence of non-linearities and random forcing, and establish their eﬀect on the physical parameters (e.g.,
viscosity) describing the transverse Navier-Stokes equation.

D. The non-linear response function and its ﬁrst order perturbative expansion

In this Subsection we proceed to expand Eq. (11) by iteration, in powers of the non-linear coupling (see the
diagrammatic representation, Fig. 1).
In this way one can calculate the perturbative corrections to the response
function to any desired order in λ. We do not present all the details of such expansion as these can be found in review
articles [14] and textbooks [10].

The calculation of the non-linear response function, [G], requires the correction matrix, [M ], which is deﬁned by a

[G] ≡ [G0] + [G0][M ][G] = [G0] + [G0][M ][G0] + [G0][M ][G0][M ][G0] + · · · ,

recursion formula:

which implies

[G]−1 = [G0]−1 − [M ] .

In Appendix A we present the diagrammatic representation of the exact transverse Navier-Stokes equation, as well
as the ﬁrst order correction to the response function. The diagram of Eq. (14) with the correction [M ], calculated to
ﬁrst order of perturbation theory in the random force amplitude, is presented in Fig. 2. When written in components,
the correction matrix [M ] is given by

Mmn(~k, ω) =

× 4 × [krPmj(k) + kjPmr(k)] Irjn(~k, ω) ,

(cid:19)
where the factor 4 is combinatorial (see Fig. 2), and the function Irjn(~k, ω) is deﬁned by

(where T means the transposed matrix). The integral over ~p would be divergent at ~p = ~0, so it is cut oﬀ at the low
wave-number given by the inverse of the system size scale, 1/L. The evaluation of Eq. (17) also involves an integration
over the frequency ω′, which has been carried out for slow rotation (see Appendix B).

As we are interested in the late time and large scale limits we have computed Mmn(~k, ω) only for ω = 0 and up to
second order in ~k [8]. The integration over wave-number ~p can be decomposed into an integration over modulus and
angles. The integrand must be expanded, up to second order in ~k, as this is suﬃcient to obtain the eﬀective viscosity
[see Eq. (B2)]. The calculation of Irjn(~k, ω) is straightforward but tedious and its technical details are presented in
Appendix B.

According to Eq. (15), the matrix [M ] provides the order λ2 correction to the inverse response function. To obtain

[M ] (for ω = 0 and in the limit k → 0), we carry out the integral of Eq. (17) and substitute into Eq. (16):

where Sd is the surface area of the unit sphere in d dimensions, Λ and 1/L are, respectively, the upper and lower
wave-number cut-oﬀs, λ = 1, and ǫijk the Levi-Civita tensor for d = 3. In arriving at this ﬁnal form we have assumed
slow rotation, that is, we have kept the rotation dependent terms up to O(Ω) in the calculation. This is explained
in Appendix B and we will come back to this point in Section V. We can compare the linear inverse response
function (B1) to its ﬁrst order correction Mij(~k, 0). In order to do so, we set ω = 0 in Eq. (B1) to obtain

[G0(~k, 0)]−1

ij = νk2 δij + 2ǫnmjΩm Pin(k) ,

which is split into an isotropic part (proportional to ν) and an anisotropic part (proportional to Ω). The ﬁrst part of
[M ] (18a) corrects the molecular shear viscosity ν, exactly as in the absence of rotation [8]. The non-linear inverse
response function must take the same form as [G0(~k, 0)]−1
ij , with ν replaced by ν′, the eﬀective viscosity [8]. The value
of ν′ can be obtained by making use of Eqs. (15) and (18a), so that

which shows that the isotropic term of [M ], Eq. (18a), renormalizes the molecular shear viscosity ν.

We must distinguish three cases, namely, y < d − 4, y = d − 4, and y > d − 4. If y = d − 4, naive perturbation
theory fails. Given that ΛL ≫ 1, in the case y < d − 4, the term Λd−y−4 dominates over (1/L)d−y−4, so we could
take the limit L → ∞ (the ~p integral is convergent in the lower limit). In contrast, in the case y > d − 4, the term
(1/L)d−y−4 dominates and we instead neglect the contribution proportional to Λd−y−4. In consequence, the actual
expansion parameter is DΛd−y−4/ν3 or DLy+4−d/ν3, according to whether y < d − 4 or y > d − 4, respectively. We
will take d − 4 < y < d2 − 4. The number DLy+4−d/ν3 can be identiﬁed with the cube of the Reynolds number,
on account of the interpretation of L as the system size scale, and that the dissipation rate is proportional to the
amplitude of the random force D [9].

The most interesting case is y = d = 3, which yields the Kolmogorov energy spectrum.

The second part of the correction (18b) has the same structure as the anisotropic term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (19), on considering that the ﬁrst term within the square brackets vanishes when it acts on uj. However, it does
not correspond to a renormalization of Ω, owing to the additional dependence on k, namely, the k2 factor. In fact,
this factor is adequate for a “viscosity term” that depends on Ω (anisotropy). Therefore, it suggests the introduction
of an anisotropic “viscosity”, which we address in the following Section.

III. SYMMETRY REQUIREMENTS: THE EFFECTIVE “VISCOSITY TENSOR”

In the previous Section we have seen that the term (18b) induces no corrections to ν. In this Section we give a
physical interpretation of this anisotropic contribution, and show that it arises from an eﬀective “viscosity tensor” for
the rotating ﬂuid with mixed symmetry in its indices. For a Newtonian ﬂuid the linear relation between the rate of
strain and stress tensors involves a rank four viscosity tensor, so that we can write [15]

Tij =

ηijmn

∂um

+

∂un
∂xm (cid:19)

(cid:18)

≡ ηijmnumn .

As both Tij and umn are symmetric tensors the only symmetries of the “viscosity tensor” are the following: ηijmn =
ηjimn and ηijmn = ηijnm. From the above symmetries we conclude that the “viscosity tensor” has 36 independent
components (in d = 3). We write ηijmn as a sum of a pair-symmetric (S) and a pair-antisymmetric (A) part as follows

ηijmn =

(ηijmn + ηmnij ) +

(ηijmn − ηmnij ) ≡ ηS

ijmn has the same symmetries as ηijmn plus ηS

so that ηS

axial symmetry (induced by the Coriolis term) reduces the number of independent components of both ηS

ijmn. The most general axisymmetric tensor (in d = 3) can be constructed from Ωi, δij, and ǫijk as follows

ijmn has the same symmetries as ηijmn plus
mnij. There are 21 pair-symmetric and 15 pair-antisymmetric independent components. The presence of

+ β3(Ω2)(ΩiΩjδmn − ΩmΩnδij ) .

We observe that the number of independent components has been reduced from 21 to 5 for the pair-symmetric term
and from 15 to 3 for the pair-antisymmetric part. The symmetry arguments used in deducing (25a,25b) are analogous
to those used in the theory of elasticity [16].

The coeﬃcient functions αi(Ω2) and βi(Ω2) can be written as a series in Ω2:

In the limit of slow rotation (linear order in Ω) these coeﬃcients reduce to their constant (Ω = 0) value and,
furthermore, the terms proportional to α3, α4, α5, β2, and β3 vanish at this order. We can then write for the “viscosity
tensor”

αn =

αnr(Ω2)r , βn =

The pair-symmetric part is isotropic and we can identify ρ0κ = α2 + 2α1/d and ρ0ν = α1, where κ and ν denote
the molecular bulk and shear kinematic viscosities, respectively; the pair-antisymmetric part, proportional to the
coeﬃcient β1, is identiﬁed below. Incompressibility means that κ = 0, leaving only ν, in the absence of rotation.
This is the molecular viscosity in the original Navier-Stokes equation (1b), which gets renormalized, becoming an
eﬀective (rotation independent) viscosity, as seen in the previous Subsection II D. However, it is to be expected that
perturbation theory, at suﬃciently high order, generates a dependence of α1 on Ω, such that one would be led to
consider a rotation dependent viscosity. At the order we are working, the eﬀect of rotation is to generate a rotation
dependent anisotropic “viscosity” of the type (27b), as will be demonstrated below.

The anisotropic “viscosity” (27b) is associated to a stress tensor T A

ij , which yields the following viscous force

.

We have thus shown that the contribution (18b) to the response function can be understood as arising from the
anisotropic “viscosity” tensor (27b). Since we are considering the case y > d − 4, we can neglect the term Λd−y−6.
The expansion parameter, proportional to D/ν3, must again be identiﬁed with the cube of the Reynolds number. We
postpone this identiﬁcation to the following Section.

IV. EFFECTIVE LARGE SCALE DYNAMICS

In this Section we focus on the new force Fi = ∂jT A

ij that appears in the ﬂuid equation of motion due to ﬁrst order

perturbative corrections, and discuss some possible physical implications.

A. The quasi-local force

Here we use the results derived in previous Sections to “correct” the transverse Navier-Stokes equation with the
newly generated (ﬁrst order in Ω) terms that arise at large scales due to rotation. In coordinate space the force (28)
becomes

Fi = β1

−(~Ω ∧ ∇2~u)i + ∂i[~Ω · (~∇ ∧ ~u)]
i
h

.

In deriving this equation we have made use of the incompressibility condition and the antisymmetry properties of
the Levi-Civita tensor. This is a quasi-local 1 force (per unit volume) in which the angular velocity couples to the
Laplacian of the ﬂuid velocity and to the vorticity ω = ~∇ ∧ u.

1Quasi-local, in general, means depending on a function (in this case the velocity ﬁeld u) and its derivatives.

The physical character of the force Fi can be revealed by writing the eﬀective equation of motion in coordinate

space. We have

∂u
∂t

+ λP(u · ~∇u) = ν′∇2u − P(2Ω ∧ u) − β′

1 P(2Ω ∧ ∇

2u) + f ,

(35)

where ν′ is the rotation independent eﬀective kinematic viscosity, [see Eq. (21)], and β′
1 = β1/(2ρ0). The magnitude
of the correction linear in Ω (the new force ~F ) can be determined by comparing it with either the Coriolis force or
/ |u| ∼ DLy+1/ν3(LΛ)2, assuming
the viscosity correction. We obtain for the ratio to the Coriolis force: β′
1
/ |u| ∼ Λ2. Hence, the expansion parameter can
that the scale of spatial velocity ﬂuctuations is 1/Λ, that is,
be identiﬁed with the cube of the Reynolds number (as in the previous Section) times (LΛ)2. On the other hand, the
ratio between the correction linear in Ω and the correction linear in ν′ is ∼ ΩL2/ν ∼ Ek−1. This was to be expected,
since Ek measures the relative strength of the viscosity and Coriolis force.

but, as ηA

is not truly viscous. This implies that the name “viscosity tensor” is not appropriate, and we have only introduced it
by analogy with the truly viscous pair-symmetric tensor [13].

mnij , we conclude that P = 0; therefore, this stress tensor, T A

B. Inertial waves

As already mentioned, rotating incompressible ﬂuids support wave solutions that are exact solutions of the non-
linear equations [1,12]. Although we have derived the quasi-local force from the randomly forced equations (that
describe turbulence), it is of interest to see how this force aﬀects these wave solutions. Let us consider wave solutions
of the form ei(~k·~x+ωt) as single mode plane waves of the linearized equation (35) (the incompressibility condition
annihilates the advective term) but without the forcing term

We can write this equation in components as follows

∂u

We are free to choose Ω = (Ωx, 0, Ωz) and k = (0, 0, k). This choice implies that uz = 0 (incompressibility condition),
so that the waves are transverse. From our choice for k the only non-vanishing components of P(k) are Pxx and Pyy,
which are equal to one. We can write the x and y components [the z component of (38) is identically null)] as follows

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

(cid:1)

ω(~k) = ±2Ω cos θ(1 − β′

1k2) + iν′k2 ,

uy = ±iux ,

uz = 0 .

These equations yield the (complex) frequency of the plane waves (dispersion relation)

where θ is the angle between k and Ω, so that k · Ω = kΩ cos θ, with k = |~k| and Ω = |~Ω|. By making use of the
dispersion relation (40) it is easy to see that the waves are circularly polarized and transverse

Wave packets are not solutions of the non-linear equations and can only be considered for small wave amplitudes.
The group velocity V of a wave packet is (for vanishing viscosity)

The “standard textbook” result is recovered by taking the limit β′
1 → 0 [1,12]. From this calculation we see that the
new term in Eq. (37) not only changes the wave frequency and phase velocity, but also the group velocity. Moreover,
the group velocity is no longer perpendicular to the phase velocity

(43)

(44)

The quasi-local force would cause the energy transport to not be perpendicular to the phase velocity and a small
fraction of the energy in the waves to be transported parallel to the wave vector.

V. DISCUSSION

We have applied perturbation theory to a homogeneous incompressible viscous ﬂuid subject to solid body rotation
and isotropic random forcing. At small scales, we assume that only the molecular shear viscosity and the Coriolis
force are needed in writing down the transverse Navier-Stokes equation (6). Our (ﬁrst order) perturbative results
demonstrate that (i) anisotropic components of the eﬀective “viscosity tensor” are dynamically generated at large
scales by the combined interplay of the Coriolis force, the random forcing term, and the inherent non-linearity of
the Navier-Stokes equation, (ii) the molecular shear viscosity ν gets corrected in the same manner as for isotropic
randomly stirred turbulence [8–10].

These perturbative results are corroborated by a symmetry principle. By making use of the axial symmetry of
a rotating ﬂuid, we have constructed the most general “viscosity tensor” that is invariant under such symmetry.
The preferred direction singled out by the angular velocity Ω breaks the isotropy and leads to new terms in the
“viscosity tensor” absent in the isotropic case [13]. We have also determined and described the role of the ﬁrst order
perturbative new term in the eﬀective ﬂuid equation of motion. It acts as a quasi-local force and, like the Coriolis
force, is not dissipative and does no net work on the ﬂuid. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that this quasi-local force
aﬀects the propagation of inertial waves in rotating ﬂuids. For small wave amplitudes a fraction of the wave energy
is transported in the same direction as the phase velocity.

The perturbative calculation is developed as a double expansion: in both the amplitude of the random force and
the angular velocity. The actual dimensionless expansion parameters turn out to be the cube of the Reynolds number
and this number times the inverse of the Ekman number, respectively. For simplicity, we have restricted ourselves to
the computation of the lowest order in both: that is, ﬁrst order in the random force amplitude and linear order in Ω.
This is suﬃcient to generate two, out of the total of eight tensor terms (seven, on account of incompressibility) allowed
by axial symmetry [see Eqs. (25a) and (25b)]. We conjecture that, at ﬁrst order in the random force amplitude, all
the remaining tensor terms are generated for higher powers in Ω: α3, α4, and β3 at quadratic order, β2 at cubic
order, and ﬁnally α5 at quartic order. Of course, as increasing powers of Ω are taken into account, the coeﬃcient
functions (26) must be expanded out to the order of Ω being investigated. The higher order terms will be needed to
study the eﬀects of fast rotation and to track the onset of the bi-dimensionalization of the ﬂuid [4].

An important step in this direction will be provided by a complete renormalization group (RG) analysis of the
large scales properties of a rotating incompressible ﬂuid. In order to carry out this RG analysis one may need to
calculate the (perturbative) corrections to the non-linear coupling term λ, as well as the random force amplitude D,
and combine these two with the response function calculation presented in this paper. Once in hand, the RG ﬁxed
points can be determined and the corresponding asymptotic behavior of the rotating ﬂuid deduced, allowing us to
compute quantities such as the scale-dependent Reynolds and Ekman numbers, among others. We hope to report on
these developments elsewhere.

APPENDIX A: DIAGRAMMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE EXACT EQUATION AND THE FIRST
ORDER CORRECTION TO THE RESPONSE FUNCTION

In this Section we include a diagrammatic representation of the exact transverse Navier-Stokes equation [see Eq. (11)]
and of the recursion relation for the ﬁrst order response function [see Eq. (14)]. We have followed the convention
introduced in Ref. [8].

The exact equation can be represented as

where the thick lines represent u(~k, ω), the open circles represent f (~k, ω), and the thin lines represent G0(~k, ω). This
graphic representation implies that the linear velocity ﬁeld u(0)(~k, ω) is given by a thin line attached to an open circle,
as we have u(0)(~k, ω) = G0(~k, ω) f (~k, ω).

In this diagrammatic representation we can also depict the recursion relation for the response function Gij (~k, ω),

Eq. (14), given by the ﬁrst order correction [M ], [Eq. (16)], as follows

double thin lines represent the ﬁrst order response function [G].

APPENDIX B: PERTURBATION EXPANSION AND EVALUATION OF THE INTEGRALS

The large distance and long time renormalizability of the transverse Navier-Stokes equation (6) implies that the
corrected response function G must have the same mathematical structure as its linear counterpart G0. G has,
therefore, the same frequency and wave-number dependence as G0 and contains the same number of parameters. The
renormalization of the response function yields the (rotation independent) eﬀective viscosity ν′. In this Appendix we
outline the major points in the calculation of the ﬁrst order correction to the response function [8].

Eq. (13) deﬁnes the linear inverse response function, which is given by

[G0(~k, ω)]−1 =

where the matrix entries are: a = −iω + νk2, b = 2Ωk1k2/k2, c = −2Ωk2k3/k2, d = 2Ωk1k3/k2, f = 2Ω(1 − k2

2/k2),

10

and h = −2Ω(1 − k2
linear response function and its inverse [8]

1/k2). In the limit of vanishing rotation (Ω = 0) we recover an isotropic diagonal matrix for the

[G0(~k, ω)]−1

ij = (−iω + νk2) δij ,

[G0(~k, ω)]ij = (−iω + νk2)−1 δij .

Given the matrix form of the inverse linear response function (B1) we can write for the linear response function 2

[G0(~k, ω)] =

The ﬁrst order correction to G is given in Subsection II D [see Eqs. (14), (15), (16), and (17)]. We have restricted
ourselves to the limit of slow rotation (linear order in Ω), and therefore need to expand both G0 and G−1
to this
0
order. We point out that G−1
is already linear in Ω [see Eq. (B1)]. To linear order in Ω the linear response function
is given by

The ﬁrst step of this calculation is to carry out the frequency integration (over ω′) in Eq. (17). From Eq. (19) we see
that the viscosity ν is the coeﬃcient of the k2 term, and to obtain the eﬀective viscosity we can set the frequency
ω to zero from the outset. Once we make ω = 0 the integral over ω′ can be computed by means of the calculus of
residues [8]. We close the contour in the lower half plane, where there are in general three simple poles, which coalesce
into one double pole in the limit of slow rotation. We obtain (keeping up to linear terms in Ω):

+ O(k2) .

We have carried out an expansion in k = |~k| and only kept up to linear order, as Eq. (16) is already linear in k, and we
only need to compute the k2 term. The previous equation was evaluated assuming a positive molecular shear viscosity
coeﬃcient (ν > 0). A change in sign will change the location of the poles and modify the frequency integration. We
have introduced the matrix [Ω(~p)] deﬁned as follows

[Ω(~p)]mk = −2ǫijkΩj Pim(p) ,

which is already linear in the angular velocity.

If we make use of this intermediate result (B5) and substitute it into Eq. (17), we are left with the integration
over the wave-number ~p. From Eqs. (15) and (19) we can see that the renormalization of the molecular viscosity ν
requires that we expand the ﬁrst order correction [M ] up to second order in the wave-number ~k. The factor in square
brackets in Eq. (16) is already linear in k, so that the integral (17) only needs to be expanded to ﬁrst order in k.
It is important to note that this integral depends on ~k not only through the integrand but also through its limits
of integration.This is because all wave-numbers appearing in (17) must remain within the set of wave-numbers to
be integrated over (in this case we must ensure that both ~p and ~k − ~p belong to this set) [8]. This means we must
integrate over the intersection of the domains 1/L ≤ |~p| ≤ Λ and 1/L ≤ |~k − ~p| ≤ Λ, where 1/L is the lower cut-oﬀ.
To ﬁrst order in ~k the second inequality can be written as 1/L + k cos θ < p < Λ + k cos θ, where θ is the angle between
~k and ~p (~k · ~p = k p cos θ). There are two cases to consider: (i) if cos θ > 0 the intersection of the two intervals can
be expressed as the diﬀerence of intervals [1/L, Λ] − [1/L, 1/L + k cos θ] and (ii) if cos θ < 0 the intersection can be
written as [1/L, Λ] − [Λ + k cos θ, Λ]. This means that the complete wave-number integration, valid up to O(k2), can
be written as

Finally, various identities needed for the angular integrations are collected here. Let Sd represent the surface area of

The angular integration of the product of an odd number of unit vectors over the unit d-sphere vanishes identically.
If we make use of the previous results, we obtain the ﬁrst order correction as written in (18a,18b).

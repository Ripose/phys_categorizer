On a multi-scale approach to analyze the joint statistics of longitudinal and transverse
increments experimentally in small scale turbulence

We analyze the relationship of longitudinal and transverse increment statistics measured in
isotropic small-scale turbulence. This is done by means of the theory of Markov processes lead-
ing to a phenomenological Fokker-Planck equation for the two increments from which a generalized
K´arm´an equation is derived. We discuss in detail the analysis and show that the estimated equation
can describe the statistics of the turbulent cascade. A remarkably result is that the main diﬀerences
between longitudinal and transverse increments can be explained by a simple rescaling-symmetry,
namely the cascade speed of the transverse increments is 1.5 times faster than that of the longitudi-
nal increments. Small diﬀerences can be found in the skewness and in a higher order intermittency
term. The rescaling symmetry is compatible with the Kolmogorov constants and the K´arm´an equa-
tion and give new insight into the use of extended self similarity (ESS) for transverse increments.
Based on the results we propose an extended self similarity for the transverse increments (ESST).

INTRODUCTION

Small scale turbulence is not yet full understood. A complete theory based on the Navier-Stokes equation has not
been achieved yet, thus our present understanding relies for the most part on phenomenological and experimental
approaches. It is assumed that turbulence forms an universal state which exhibits stationarity, isotropic and homo-
geneity in a statistical sense [25, 44]. In general, turbulence are driven on large scale, i.e. energy is injected into large
scale motions and is dissipated on small scales resulting in a net ﬂux of energy from large to small scales [56]. The
energy ﬂux results from the inherent instability and the subsequent breakup of vortices into smaller ones.

For local isotropic turbulence the main challenge is to understand spatial correlation. Usually the turbulent ﬁeld
U(x, t) is characterized by increments ur = e
U(x, t)], where e denotes a unit vector in a certain
direction, x denotes a reference point and r a displacement vector. The increments are taken as stochastic variables
in dependence of the scale variable r =
and by varying r correlation on diﬀerent scales can be studied with
the increments. In the following, we assign ur to longitudinal increments, that means e is parallel to r and vr to
transversal increments, for which e is orthogonal to r. For speciﬁc length ri we write ui and vi in a short way.
The central challenge in turbulence is to explain the statistics of exceptional frequent occurrence of large velocity
increments on small scales r, which can not be understood with normal statistics. This is the so called intermittency
problem.

The work of Kolmogorov [37, 38] is still the foundation of the small-scale turbulence theory. The starting hypothesis
is that the possible symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equation are recovered in a statistical sense for high Reynolds
numbers. These symmetries are homogeneity, i.e. the statistics of the increments is independent of the reference
point x, isotropy, i.e. the statistics does not change under rotation of the frame of reference, and stationarity, i.e. the
statistics is not time dependent. A further hypothesis is scale invariance, i.e. loosely spoken the structures of diﬀerent
sizes looks similar. Kolmogorov has considered the statistics in terms of structure functions (moments of the velocity
= (r/r1)ξn
rξn with two diﬀerent distances
increments), for which scale-invariance reads as
r and r1.

Using this hypothesis, Kolmogorov has furthermore assumed that for high Reynolds number the statistics of velocity
increments depends only on the energy dissipation ǫ and the scale r and ended up by using dimension arguments
with
L. The constants Cn denote the Kolmogorov constants, η is the scale where the
dissipation takes place and L, the integral length scale, is the largest scale of the ﬂow. However there are correction
due to the ﬂuctuating dissipation energy leading to deviations from the exponent ξn = n/3. This typical property of
turbulence is an other aspect of the above mentioned intermittency. According to the reﬁned self similarity hypothesis

The ﬁrst model for the exponents ξn is Kolmogorov’s log-normal model, which results in ξn = n/3
3)/18
[39]. If instead of the structure functions the probability density functions (pdf) p(ur) are considert, this nontrivial
scaling behavior correspond to a change of the form of the pdfs with r. To explain intermittency, i.e. the non-trivial
scaling behaviour, is still one of the prominent challenges in turbulence.

At ﬁrst, the examinations were only concentrated on the longitudinal increments. There was hope that the exponent
ξn can describe the self-similarity of every quantity of the velocity ﬁeld. But recently, a lot of aﬀord was undertaken
to consider also the transverse increments and they seem to have essential diﬀerent properties [1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13,
14, 15, 15, 16, 18, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, 50, 58, 63, 65, 69]. This implies that the models as
well as the considerations concerning only the longitudinal increments are too speciﬁc and a better understanding of
the turbulence has to include the transverse increments.

Longitudinal and transverse increments belong to diﬀerent geometric / kinematic structures in the ﬂow. The
longitudinal increments can be associated with strain-like structures, the transverse increments with vorticity-like
structures. Thus it is natural to modify RSH of equation (1) and to use local averaged enstrophy (squared vorticity)
rather than local averaged dissipation for the transverse increments (reﬁned similarity hypothesis for transverse
increments, RSHT, see [11, 15]),

If intermittency results from the ﬂuctuating dissipation and enstrophy, then the deviations from the Kolmogorov 41
theory [37] can be investigated by the scaling of
, respectively. For inﬁnite high Reynolds number
and
i
the scaling of averaged dissipation and enstrophy should be the same [46], but in many experiments and simulation
one observe diﬀerences in both exponents for ﬁnite Reynolds number [9, 11, 14, 18, 28, 31, 33, 47, 58, 64, 69]. At
least four arguments are used to explain this observations: 1) anisotropy, 2) eﬀect of Reynolds number, 3) inﬂuence
of boundary conditions, 4) intermittency. Anisotropy typically exists in every ﬂow on large scales and it can inﬂuence
the exponent stronger than intermittency itself [58, 69]. Decreasing the Reynolds number eﬀects the scaling exponents
in such a way that the diﬀerences between them increase [4, 18, 58, 69].

The structure functions

as well as the scaling properties involved can not deﬁne unambiguously the
turbulent ﬁeld; for instance ﬂows with diﬀerent structures may have the same scaling properties [64]. The same is
true for the probability distributions p(ur) and p(vr), which are in essential equivalent to the structure functions.
The reason is that these quantities are just two-point statistics. Deﬁnitive more general and detailed are the multi-
point (or multi-scale) distributions p(u1, v1, r1; . . . ; un, vn, rn) (or multi-scale structure functions
) for
i
diﬀerent scales ri. These probabilities also consider the joint statistics of longitudinal and transverse increments and
thus enables also to describe the interaction between them. Furthermore they describe the simultaneous occurrence
of increments ui, vi on several length scales ri.

In this paper, we focus on an approach to characterize multi-scale statistics. It has been shown that it is possible
to get access to the joint probability distribution p(u1, r1; u2, r2; . . . ; un, rn) via a Fokker-Planck equation estimated
directly from measured data [20, 21, 43]. This has attracted interest and was applied to diﬀerent problems of the
complexity of turbulence like energy dissipation [32, 42, 45], universality of turbulence [55], the theoretical derivation
of the Fokker-Planck-equation from the Navier-Stokes equation in the limit of high Reynolds number [17] and the
analysis of stochastic time series [23, 59, 62]. The characteristic of this method is that it is based on pure data
analysis, i.e. it is a parameter-free method, and that the few underlying assumptions are veriﬁable. Thus no special
model-ideas are interwoven with the procedure.

In this article we extend this approach to analyze the joint statistics of longitudinal and transverse increments.
A ﬁrst result concerning the diﬀerent cascade speed of longitudinal and transverse cascade has been published in
a preceding letter [60]. The aim of this article is to present the used method and its extension to longitudinal
and transverse increments in detail and to discuss the similarities and diﬀerences of longitudinal and transverse
increments. We start with a short description of the concepts of Markov processes and deﬁne the notation. In section
III we describe the experiment and characterize the data with two-point statistics (i.e. with one scale) in section IV.
Next, we analyze longitudinal and transverse increments separately by means of Markov-processes with respect to
multi-points or multi-scale statistics. Then we go over to a combined analysis of both increments and discuss a new
symmetry which connect both increments. An interpretation in section V and a conclusion will ﬁnish the paper.

II. THE MATHEMATICS OF MARKOV PROCESSES

The basis of our argumentation and of the used analysis is the theory of Markov and diﬀusion processes. Therefore
we will give a concise description of them, which also serve as a guideline for the analysis of the turbulent signal. The
foundations are known since Kolmogorov [36], but a detailed presentation can also be found in standard textbooks
such as [26, 29, 57].

We restrict ourself to the case of a two dimensional stochastic variable, denoted by the stochastic vector

ur :=

ur
vr

.

(cid:18)
Usually, a stochastic process is formulated in the time t but one can also imagine diﬀerent independent scalars; for
our purpose to characterize the turbulent cascade the scale r is the independent variable.

(cid:19)

The stochastic process underlying the evolution of ur in the scale r is Markovian,

if the conditional pdf

p ( u1, r1 |

u2, r2; . . . ; un, rn, ) with r1 ≤
p ( u1, r1 |

rn fulﬁlls the relation

r2 ≤ · · · ≤
u2, r2; u3, r3; . . . ; un, rn ) = p( u1, r1 |

u2, r2 ) ,

where p ( u1, r1 |
u2, r2, u3, r3; . . . ; un, rn ) denotes the probability for ﬁnding certain values for u1 at some scale r1,
provided that the values of ui at the larger scales ri > r1, i > 1, are known. The condition (4) states that the
increment distribution of u1 on r1 only depends on the increment value on one larger scale r2 and that further scales
do not give more information. Markov properties imply a remarkable property. The knowledge of the conditional pdf
p ( ur, r

r0) is suﬃcient to determine any n–point pdf:

u0, r0 ) (with r

p ( u1, r1, u2, r2, . . . , un, rn ) = p ( u1, r1 |

p ( un−1, rn−1 |

p ( u2, r2 |
×

u3, r3 )
×
p ( un, rn ) ,

...

i.e. the single conditioned pdfs contain the entire information about the stochastic process

For Markov processes the evolution of the conditional pdf in the scale r can be described by the Kramers-Moyal
u0, r0 ) in the variables ur and r. According to Pawula’s theorem,
expansion, a partial diﬀerential equation for p ( ur, r
this expansion truncates after the second term if the fourth order expansion coeﬃcient vanishes [57]. In this case, the
Kramers-Moyal expansion reduces to the Fokker–Planck equation (or Kolmogorov equation)

Note that we have multiplied both sides of the usually used Fokker-Planck equation with r; on the right hand side
we have incorporated this factor in the deﬁnition of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients (8). The Fokker-Planck equation
ur0, r0 ) but also the evolution of the pdf
describes not only the evolution of the conditional probability p( ur, r
p(ur, r), as can bee seen by integrating (6) over u0.

M(k) in dependence of ∆r towards ∆r = 0 [54]. An other possibility would be to approximate the drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients by the coeﬃcients M(k) for one ﬁnite ∆r. The corrections of higher order in ∆r can then be taken
into consideration by correction terms. The approved coeﬃcients can be used to recalculate the corrections, and
if one perform this procedure recursively, the result converge towards the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients [53]. Both
approaches give similar results, but the approximation of [53] has some pitfalls, if it does not examined the limes,
which is an essential point of this analysis, see also [22].

A solution p(u, l) of the Fokker-Planck equation can be derived from the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation p(u, l) =

Below we use this path-integral approximation to solve the Fokker-Planck equation numerically.

The error analysis for a diﬀusion process in two variables is more complicated than for one dimension. We perform
the error analysis according to [61]; here we just sketch the procedure and give the resulting equations for the error
estimations. An error analysis comprises a quantity to estimate and a stochastic quantity which leads to an uncertainty.
The two quantitates to estimate are the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients and it is assumed that the stochastic quantity
is given solely due to the stochastic nature of the process. Because the randomness is determined by D(2), the error
of D(1) and D(2) can be expressed by D(2) itself. The following results are valid for small ∆r. The error of the drift
coeﬃcient is given by

where N is the number of samples used to estimate D(1). To calculate the error for the diﬀusion matrix, one has

III. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

This equation allows a direct comparison of the Fokker-Planck equation with structure functions.

For the subsequent analysis we use two data sets measured in the central region of a wake behind a cylinder. The
Reynolds numbers are Rλ = 180 and Rλ = 550, respectively. If nothing else is said, the data set with Rλ = 180 is
used. The high Reynolds number data set is used for comparison.

For the ﬁrst data set the local velocity is measured in a wake 60 diameters behind a cylinder with cross section
D = 20 mm. The Reynolds number is 13200 with a Taylor based Reynolds number of Rλ =180. We have measured
the velocity component U in the mean ﬂow direction, the V component orthogonal to the cylinder axis with an X-wire
108 samples with a sampling frequency of 25 kHz
(Dantec’s frame 90N10 with Dantec’s 55P51 X-wire). We collect 1.25
using a 16bit A/D converter; high frequency electronic noise was suppressed with a low-pass ﬁlter to prevent aliasing.
We use Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen turbulence to convert time lags into spatial displacements. With the sampling
frequency of 25 kHz and a mean velocity of 9.1 m/s, the spatial resolution of the measurement is not better than 0.36
r0
mm. For the integral length scale L =
0 R(r)dr, where r0 represent the ﬁrst zero-crossing of the autocorrelation
R(r) function, we obtain a value of L =137 mm for the stream-wise component U and Lt =125 mm for the component
R
V . Taylor’s microscale λ is calculated using the method proposed by [5]. For isotropic turbulence, λ can be written
as

·

λ2 =

σ
(∂U/∂x)2
h

i

,

where σ is the standard deviation of the turbulent ﬂuctuations. The limit has been calculated by ﬁtting a second-order
polynomial to the data, resulting in λ =4.8 mm for the stream-wise component and λt =3.0 mm for the V -component.
The dissipation scale η can not be resolved, because it is smaller than the length of the hot-wire and smaller than the
spatial resolution calculated with the ﬁnite sampling frequency and the Taylor-hypothesis.

The high Reynolds number ﬂow is measured 40 diameter behind a cylinder with a cross section of 5 cm. The
Reynolds number is Re= 84600, the Taylor based Reynolds number is Rλ = 550. The U -component is measured in
107 data points are measured
direction of the mean ﬂow, the V -component in direction of the cylinder axis. 1.25
with a frequency of 200 kHz. The facilities are the same as in the ﬁrst measurement. Typical length are L = 15.5 cm
and λ = 3.87 mm

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Two point statistics

First of all, we characterize our data by two-point statistics (structure functions, pdf of increments etc.). In this
way, we have a reference to results presented frequently in the literature and we get a ﬁrst impression of the diﬀerences
between longitudinal and transverse increments.

A central pre-assumption for many considerations of small scale turbulence is isotropy. To study isotropy we use
the K´arm´an equation (isotropy relation) because it is the simplest exact relation for structure functions which rely
on isotropy. The K´arm´an equation connects the second order longitudinal and transversal structure functions:

equation (18) are plotted. The relative deviations are plotted by a dashed line. For smaller scales r < L the K´arm´an equation
is well fulﬁlled within 5% and is isotropic in this sense. On larger scales the data are clear anisotropic.

Fig. 1 shows the left and right hand side of the K´arm´an equation, i.e. the second transverse structure function and the
hypothetic transverse structure function for isotropic ﬂows calculated from the longitudinal one. Taking the validity
of the K´arm´an equation as indication of isotropy, we see that for small distances r < L the isotropic relation is well
fulﬁlled, the relative error is within 5%. For large distances r > L isotropy is violated (large scale anisotropy), the
ratio

is approximately 0.66, which is a typical value in the literature.

Next, we analyze the data with respect to scaling properties. Fig. 2a) shows the energy spectrum with Kolmogorov’s
-5/3–law for comparison. In Fig. 2b) the third order structure function is plotted in a compensated representation,
/r is plotted against r to estimate the scaling range. The maximum lies at 10−2 m, which deﬁnes according
i.e.
to Kolmogorov’s 4/5-law the position and the width of the scaling range.

to estimate the scaling exponents of the structure functions. In Fig. 3 we show the application of ESS to the third,
fourth and sixth order structure functions. The third order structure function is of especially interest, because it serve
as the reference in ESS. In all three ﬁgures it can be seen that the transverse exponent is smaller than the longitudinal
one, ξt
n. This result is well accepted [2, 15, 18, 49, 69]. As a consequence, one scaling group is not enough to
characterize the turbulent ﬂow and the statistics is more complex than previous thought.

To make this more clear, Fig. 4 shows the exponents ξl

n up to order 8. For the sixth order structure
function we get ξl
n yields the intermittency
parameter µ =0.24. Both is in good accordance with the experimentally expected values, see for example [19]. The
transverse exponents are clearly smaller then the longitudinal exponents for n > 3, i.e. the transverse structures are
signiﬁcantly more intermittent, see Fig. 4. This heavily discussed point will be discussed in detail at the end of this
article.

In Fig. 6 the probability density of longitudinal and transversal velocity increments are plotted. The velocity
distribution on each scale is normalized with the respective standard deviation, i.e. uσ := ur/σu,r and vσ := vr/σv,r,
to compare only the form of the curves.
In Fig. 7 the longitudinal and transversal probability densities for two
diﬀerent length scales (r = L/5 and r = λ) are shown. In both ﬁgures, the intermittent character of the statistics can
be seen. Whereas for L = L/5 the main diﬀerence is seen only for positive increments, i.e. the main diﬀerence is the

increments more intermittent, see Fig. 7b).

Next we present brieﬂy results from the high Reynolds number data set. The K´arm´an equation is well fulﬁlled, i.e.
the data are isotropic in good approximation, see Fig. 8. Fig. 9a) presents the energy spectrum of the longitudinal
increments which shows a distinct scaling range with the exponent -5/3 in accordance to Kolmogorov’s theory. The
scaling range is more pronounced for this data set as it can be seen also from the third order structure function,
compare Figs. 9b) and 2b).

In this section, we have presented our data with respect to two-point statistics, i.e. regarding only the statistics
of increments for one ﬁxed scale separately. The results are comparable to them given in the literature for moderate
Reynolds numbers. Diﬀerences between longitudinal and transverse increments are clearly visible in pdfs and structure
functions indicating that the transverse increments are more intermittent as the longitudinal. In the following we apply
a new analysis to study the dependence between diﬀerent length scale and the interaction between both increments
which was not studied so far.

B. Multi-Point Statistics: FP-Analysis

In this section we present the analysis of the multi-point statistics separately for the longitudinal and transverse
increments as it was described in section II. There are in essential three steps: First we show the validity of the Markov
properties. Secondly, we calculate the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients and show that the data obey a diﬀusion process.

1. Markov Properties

The foundation of the following analysis is the validity of the Markov properties. They can be tested directly
on data by their deﬁnition (4). Because of the ﬁnite numbers of measured data points we restrict ourself to the
u2, r2; u3, r3). Fig. 10 shows both side of this equation for the longitudinal
veriﬁcation of p(u1, r1|
L/2 . It can be seen
increments for the three length scales r1 = ∆r, r2 = 2∆r and r3 = 3∆r with ∆r = 68.3 mm
that both distributions coincide. For a length scale below a certain threshold, the Markov properties are not fulﬁlled,
see Fig. 11. We call the associated length scale ‘Markov coherence length’ or short ‘Markov length’ lm, i.e. above lm
the Markovian properties are fulﬁlled, below lm not [24].

To quantify the results and to get a more objective and systematic measure for the Markov properties and the Markov
length, we perform a Wilcoxon test, which compares two random samples with size m and n (see [54, 67]). For the
Wilcoxon test, one has to count the number of inversions of two samples, here for the single and double conditioned
/σ(m, n), where Q is the number of inversions calculated
variable u1|u2 and u1|u2,u3. We calculate

distances the deviations are not signiﬁcant anymore. We identify the distance ∆r = lm, where
drops to 1 as the
Markov length [70]. This value can be estimated by ﬁtting an exponential function to the values and by interpreting
the passage through the value 1 as the Markov length, as it is presented in Fig. 12. The Markov properties are also
fulﬁlled for transverse increments, but with a smaller Markov length, see Fig. 13. The Markov length varies within
20% with respect to the condition u2 but remains about constant with respect to r. For the longitudinal increments
the Markov length lies in the range 7.4 mm < lm,l < 9.6 mm, for the transversal increments the Markov length lies in
1.4 as it is known for the Taylor length [51]. Note, that
the range 5.5 mm < lm,t < 6.8 mm. The ratio is lm,l/lm,t ≈
up to now wee see that lm ≈
We conclude from the results that the ‘cascade’ of longitudinal and transverse increments can be described by a
Markov-process for stepsizes larger than the Markov length lm, which becomes important again for the estimation of
the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients, as will be seen below.

2. Kramers-Moyal Coeﬃcients

The drift coeﬃcients D(1) and the diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(2) are calculated according to Eq. (7) directly from
the measured data following the procedure described in [22, 54]. The crucial point is the estimation of the limit
lim∆r→0 M (i), see Fig. 14. Only the points with ∆r > lm are used to estimate the limit. For ∆r < lm the Markov-
properties are violated, for ∆r > lm the dependence of M (i) with respect to ∆r is linear, see Fig. 14. We thus use a

The resulting drift coeﬃcients D(1) and diﬀusion coeﬃcients D(2) are shown in Fig. 15 for the length scale r = L/2.
The drift coeﬃcient can be approximated by a straight line with negative slope. Small deviations from this behavior
are visible for the transverse component. For the diﬀusion coeﬃcient qualitative diﬀerences between both increments
are visible. In contrast to the transverse coeﬃcient, the longitudinal coeﬃcient is not symmetric under reﬂection
u. This is compatible with Kolmogorov’s 4/5-law, which states that the longitudinal distribution are skewed.

The drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are the ﬁrst two coeﬃcients of the Kramers-Moyal expansion. According to the
Pawula-theorem all higher coeﬃcients vanish, if the fourth-order coeﬃcients are zero and thus the expansion simpliﬁes
to a Fokker-Planck equation. In Fig. 16 this fourth order coeﬃcients are plotted for r = L/2. The coeﬃcient D(4)
for the longitudinal coeﬃcient vanish within the error bars. The corresponding transversal coeﬃcient has a value
slightly above zero. But one can estimate with the Kramers-Moyal expansion that the contribution of this coeﬃcient
is less than one-hundredth in comparison to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Therefore, we want to assume in the following a
vanishing fourth order coeﬃcient. This assumption is additionally justiﬁed below by showing that the Fokker-Planck
equation describes the increment statistics well.

Next, the r-dependence in Eq. (21) is investigated. It can be estimated by ﬁtting the approximation (21) to the
numerical Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients. The result is depicted in Fig. 17 for the longitudinal (black squares) and

Integration of the Fokker-Planck Equation

Next we want to demonstrate that the Fokker-Planck equation can describe correctly the statistics of the turbulent
ﬁeld. If the estimated drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients (22) are used to solve the Fokker-Planck equation numerically,
the resulting distributions can be compared with the distributions estimated directly from the data. First, the
numerical estimation of the single distributions p(u, r) and p(v, r) in dependence of r are discussed, for which the
distribution on the integral scale p(u, r = L) and p(v, r = L) are used as initial conditions. In Fig. 18 p(u, r) and
p(v, r) are shown for several length scales. The curves are in good agreement with the data. It is important to stress
that also the intermittency eﬀects and the skewness can be described well. A similar calculation has been done for
v0, r0) starting at the integral scale with Dirac’s delta function
the conditional distributions p(u, r

p(u, r = L

are shown in Figs. 19 and 20 in dependence of the initial value u0 and v0. Comparing the conditional probability
distributions in Fig. 19 with those in Fig. 20 it is evident that the transverse statistics relaxes faster (the contour
lines are more horizontal).

On the basis of these results we conclude that the increment statistics can be well described by a Fokker-Planck
equation, whose drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are given by (22). Thus, we can examine the increment statistics by
means of the drift coeﬃcient D(1) and diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2).

A closer look at the d-coeﬃcients of Eq. (22) shown in Fig. 17 gives insight into the diﬀerences of the longitudinal
and transverse increment statistic. It can be seen in Fig. 17a) b) and d) that the absolute value of the transverse
coeﬃcients are larger than the longitudinal one. This means that the transverse cascade are in a way ‘faster’ and
more noisy. This behavior can be state more precisely by taking into account a remarkably symmetry, namely, if the
2r/3, the dominating terms fall on
r-dependence of the transverse increments is rescaled by the factor 2/3, i.e. r
top of the others, see Fig. 21. Thus the main statistical diﬀerences between longitudinal and transverse increments
vanish by this rescaling. Diﬀerences only remains in the diﬀusion term, see Fig. 22. In section V we discuss this
result in further detail.

C. Joint multipoint-statistics of longitudinal and transverse increments

In the preceding section we have analyzed the statistics of longitudinal and transverse increments separately. But
this separation is restrictive because the dynamics of both components come from one velocity ﬁeld and are therefore
connected. They can not be separated due to the nonlinear advection term in the Navier-Stokes equation. Therefore
we extend the above analysis and examine the joint stochastic properties. We chose the both increments as one state
with the scale parameter r, see Eq. (3). The aim is to estimate a Fokker-Planck equation (6) in these two variables.
We proceed similar to the one dimension analysis. The main diﬀerence is that one need much more data and one has
to estimate much more coeﬃcients, because the drift-coeﬃcient is now a vector and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient a matrix.
The veriﬁcation of the Markov properties for two variables is doubtful because one has to estimate the double
conditioned probability function for a two dimensional process, i.e. a six-dimensional function with a ﬁnite number
of data points. One needs approximately 104 times more data points in comparison to the one dimensional case if
the results should be similar signiﬁcant. The limiting factor is the duration of the measurement and the amount
of data. But we know separately for both components that the the Markov properties are valid. In general, if two
variables have Markov properties, also the joint statistics have Markov properties (the reverse is not true in general
[57]). Therefore we assume that the combined process is Markovian as well.

The next step is to estimate the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients. First, one has to calculate the approximation of the
drift vector M (1)
ij (u, v, r, ∆r) in dependence of ∆r, see Eq. (8). As in
the one dimensional case we calculate the approximation of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients by ﬁtting a linear
polynomial to these functions in dependence of ∆r above the Markov length. In doing so, we have to consider two

(u, v, r, ∆r) and of the diﬀusion matrix M (2)

The shape of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃents are shown in Figs. 23 and 24 for the length scale L/4. The
drift coeﬃcients have a simple form: they depend only linearly on one variable, see Fig. 23. That means the process
decouples in the deterministic part. Remark if this was not the case the increments could not be Markovian seperately
in contradiction to our ﬁndings. The diagonal coeﬃcients of the diﬀusion matrix are shown in Figs. 24a) and 24b).
Roughly spoken they consist of a curved surface shifted upwards with a minimum at u > 0 and v = 0. The oﬀ-diagonal

Before we interpret the results, it has to be shown that the Fokker-Planck equation together with the coeﬃcients (23)
and (24) can reproduce the statistics of the measured data. There are in principal two ways to verify the estimated
drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. One way is to solve the Fokker-Planck equation, the other way is to calculate the
structure functions, which can be done for example with the hierarchical equation for the structure functions (16). In
both cases the results can be compared with the corresponding quantities estimated directly from the data. In Fig.
26 the solution of the hierarchical structure function equation (16) is shown for n = 0 and m = 1, . . . , 6. It is in good
agreement with the structure functions. To show that also the joint probability distributions can be reproduced, we
solve the Fokker-Planck equation by calculating the path-integral (10) numerically. We use the estimated Kramers-
Moyal coeﬃcients and start the simulation on the integral scale r = L with a Gaussian distribution for p(u0, r = L)
and integrate down to r = 2λ. Figs. 27 and 28 show the results. Because of the good accordance we assume that the
d-coeﬃcients can be used to characterize the statistics of longitudinal and transverse increments.

The number of coeﬃcients in (24) can be reduced by a remarkably symmetry. If one multiplies the r-dependence for
the transverse increments with a factor 2/3, the related coeﬃcients of longitudinal and transverse increments coincides,
i.e. dlong(r)

INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS

From the above analysis we know that the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients contain the information of the small-
scale statistics of the turbulence. More speciﬁcally, they contain the joint statistics of longitudinal and transverse
increments as well as the statistics on multi scales. Thus we can study the structure of small-scale turbulence with
aid of the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients.

First we will argue that the hierarchical equation (16) is a kind of generalized K´arm´an equation and we discuss the
similarities and diﬀerences between these two equations. Then we consider the 2/3-rescaling symmetry in more detail,
show that it is consistent with known results and ﬁnd that the coupling of longitudinal and transversal increments
is important for intermittency. At least we show that the scaling exponents of the transverse structure function can
fake a too small value if the frequently used extended self similarity (ESS) is used to estimate the transverse scaling
exponent without taking into account the rescaling. This is an important result belonging to a frequently discussed
issue in the analysis of fully-developed turbulence: the problem of possible diﬀerences in the scaling properties of
longitudinal and transverse velocity increments in isotropic small scale turbulence.

A. Generalized K´arm´an equation

The hierarchical equation (16) calculated from the Fokker-Planck equation is a kind of generalized K´arm´an equation:

it is an equation which connects diﬀerent moments. Let us compare the K´arm´an equation

Although the K´arm´an equation holds for Re
and our result is obtained for quite moderate Reynolds number, the
structure of both equations is remarkably similar, except for the additive term d11. In Fig. 29a) is shown how well
. The agreement of (27) to the data is better than that of the K´arm´an equation
these equations reproduce
because the ﬂow seems to be slightly anisotropic. Thus we can also analyze anisotropic eﬀects with the Fokker-Planck
equation. We want to look in more detail at the diﬀerences by comparing the terms associated to the same structure

reﬂects the diﬀerent meaning of the two equations. Note that the anisotropy is clearer visible in Fig. 29a) than in
Fig. 1 because in 29a) the diﬀerence of two quantities of similar magnitude, right hand side of Eq. (26), is plotted
and thereby the deviation to the isotropic case is more pronounced.

Whereas the K´arm´an equation connects only the second order structure functions, the Fokker-Planck equation
is an equation also for higher orders. Furthermore its solution not only gives the relation between the structure
functions but can even reproduce the structure functions itself. These informations are included in the d-coeﬃcients.
An additional diﬀerence is that the Fokker-Planck equation also includes the information of the multi-scale statistics.

We want to mention that also the second K´arm´an equation [44]

(cid:10)
has a similar structure as the hierarchical equation of the Fokker-Planck equation (Eq. (27) for m = 3 and n = 0):

In Fig. 25 we have recognized by the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients that the dominating diﬀerences between

which we have interpreted as a rescaling symmetry. This has some consequences for the increment statistics. First we
want to examine how this symmetry becomes apparent in the structure functions. Then we discuss small diﬀerences
between longitudinal and transverse increments, which exist beyond the diﬀerences in the diﬀerent cascade speeds.
At last we show that the rescaling is compatible to known results supporting our ﬁndings.

The rescaling-symmetry of the cascades speeds can also be observed directly at the structure functions

This equation is a diﬀerential equation for the diﬀerences
of the longitudinal and transverse structure
functions. If the initial condition of this equation is zero, the solution would be zero without the underlined terms.
Furthermore, because mdu
11 /2 < 0 for all order m of interest, this equation has stable solutions and
−
deviations in the initial conditions will decrease fast converging to the 2/3-rescaling apart from the discussed terms.
The simply underlined term violates the 2/3-symmetry because of duu
11 (r)
22 (2r/3), the double underlined term
violates it because of the not symmetric occurrence of the coeﬃcient du
11 in the equation. For even m the last term is
the smallest one because of the odd moment and because of the small pre-factor, which is on the same magnitude as
the quadratic term. The inﬂuence of the two last terms become larger with increasing order of the moments.

The similar structure of Eq. (34) and (36) allows to discuss both equations together. The direction of the cascade is
from large to smaller scales r, so that ∂rFu < 0 means increasing intermittency towards smaller scales. The ﬁrst term
is the dominating negative term. The second term vanishes for large scales, because of the approximately Gaussian
form of the distribution and is positive if intermittency increase. The third term simpliﬁes to 12dvv
12 because of the
approximate Gaussian character for large scales with the covariance σ2
12. This term describes the coupling between
both components and is larger than zero, i.e. it acts against intermittency. The fourth term belongs to higher order
corrections and describes the inﬂuence of the skewness onto the intermittency. To summarize, only the two quadratic
terms duu

A positive derivative ∂rSu > 0 means an increasing skewness for decreasing scales. The ﬁrst term on the right hand
side of Eq. (36) is always negative. The second term is positive and is therefore necessary for a skewed distribution.
The third term ampliﬁes an existing skewness. Therefore the coeﬃcient du
11 is essential for the skewness, but also the
‘intermittency’ term duu

11 leads to an increasing skewness.

We can summarize the results in a short form:

If the r-dependence of the transverse component is rescaled by a factor of 2/3, then the only diﬀerences can be found
in intermittency contributions and the skewness.

C. Compatibility to known results

To support our ﬁndings of the rescaling symmetry, we show that it is compatible to the K´arm´an equation and to
the ratio of Kolmogorov constants. These two aspects were already presented in [60], but here we go in more detail
and add some new aspects.

The K´arm´an equation (18) is consistent with the 2/3-rescaling symmetry, as one can see by interpreting the K´arm´an

equation as a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion with the ‘small’ quantity r/2:

hold also for the limit Re

It is important to discuss the quality of the approximation (37) with respect to scaling exponents. The remainder

rξ2 the exponent is neither changed by the above approximation

for pure scaling nor is the local exponent changed signiﬁcantly for real data as one can see from ﬁgure 30b). The
(cid:10)
reason is that the validity of the approximation depend only weak on the exponent. In reverse this does mean that
the 2/3-rescaling does not distort the exponent strong.

functions, this meaning gets lost for ﬁnite Reynold numbers. But if we treat the structure function as the independent
variable and r as the dependent variable, i.e. r is a function of the structure functions, and calculate the ratio
r(

The constant ratio of the Kolmogorov constants are just a special case of the 2/3-rescaling. Whereas the former
is valid only for high Reynolds number, the 2/3-rescaling is also a property of moderate Reynolds-number ﬂows. A
further consequence belongs to the discussion whether the Kolmogorov constants are universal or not [6, 52, 68]. Even
if the Kolmogorov constants are not universal, the ratio r(

turbulence is isotropic.

Intermittency and the coupling of longitudinal and transverse increments

From the form of the Fokker-Planck equation it can be seen that intermittency is closely related to the interaction
of longitudinal and transverse increments. More precisely, a necessary condition of intermittency is the mutual
dependence of longitudinal and transversal increments. This can be deduced as follows.

First, we neglect the small diﬀerences in the intermittency and the skewness. If the 2/3-rescaling is applied, the
form of the Fokker-Planck equation becomes symmetric with respect to exchange of ur and vr. Moreover, because
of the linear drift term and the rotational symmetric diﬀusion term, the Fokker-Planck equation becomes rotational
symmetric and one can use circular coordinates with radius ρ2 = u2
r . Thus rotational symmetric functions
F (ρ2 = u2

r ) solve the Fokker-Planck equation.

r + v2

r + v2

r + v2

To consider the question wether ur and vr are coupled, we construct a contradiction by assuming that ur and
r ). This means for a solution F the relation F (ρ2) =
r)F (v2
vr are independent, in the sense that F (u2
r)F (v2
F (u2
r ) holds. But this equation is only fulﬁlled for Gaussian distributed functions F what is in
contradiction to the fact that the turbulent ﬂow is intermittent. Thus we conclude the two increments ur and vr
depend of each other. Intermittency models has to take into account this coupling between the two increments and
the one dimensional intermittency models has to be extended.

E. Transverse scaling exponents

In this section we focus on the wide debate about possible diﬀerences between the scaling exponents of longitudinal
and transverse structure functions and consider the implications of the rescaling symmetry on it. In Fig. 4 we have
shown the recognized result that using ESS the transverse exponents are smaller than the longitudinal. Nevertheless,
we use a new ansatz to reconsider this result and combine the diﬀerences of the longitudinal and transverse cascade
speeds with ESS.

Because the assumption for the longitudinal structure functions in ESS is

un(r)
n , see (40), the
h|
(rft(r))ξt
n with a function ft diﬀerent from fl.
corresponding relation for the transverse increments has to be
fl, see (41) and (42). Using for the second order structure function
Notice that the implicit assumption in ESS was ft ≡
the 3/2-rescaling found from the Fokker-Planck equation and assuming that the diﬀerences between skewness and
intermittency are small for this order, we ﬁnd a relation for the two functions: Starting with
we get rft(r) = (3rfl(3r/2)/2)ξl

Fig. 32 shows the application of ESST to the transverse structure functions. As an remarkably result, the diﬀerences

between both exponents vanish. Thus one scaling group is suﬃcient to characterize both increments.

Notice that the diﬀerences between the exponents found with ESS are due to a none existing scaling behavior of
the structure functions with r. It is evident that our rescaling does not change the exponents in case of pure scaling
n , which is expected to be valid if the Reynolds number goes to inﬁnity (see also

Next we perform the analog analysis for our second data set with the higher Reynolds number Rλ = 550. In Fig.

diﬀerences in the scaling exponents vanish for ESST (ESS: ξl

(α = u, v n = 4, 6) are shown. The use of ESS for the longitudinal exponents results in
an almost constant local exponent. The transverse exponents have oscillations, which were explained by log-periodic
oscillations. If ESST is applied, the diﬀerences between longitudinal and transverse exponents vanish within these
oscillations.

VI. CONCLUSION

27

We have analyzed the diﬀerences and similarities between longitudinal and transverse increments. Diﬀerences in
their structure functions and probability distributions were found, which were observed already from other groups. To
look in more detail at these diﬀerences we have used a method to estimate by pure data analysis a phenomenological
Fokker-Planck equation and have extended this analysis to both, longitudinal and transverse increments. We have
checked carefully the mathematical prerequisites of this method and found that they are well fulﬁlled for our data.
Then we have estimated the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the Fokker-Planck equation directly from the data. The
solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with these coeﬃcients reproduces well the probability distributions and the
structure functions. Thus, the statistics of the joint probability of longitudinal and transverse increments is encoded
in the drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. These new quantities for analyzing the turbulent ﬂow determine a stochastic
process in r, which can be interpreted as a ‘cascading process’. The statistics of both increments are decoupled in the
deterministic drift vector but are coupled via the nonlinear and no diagonal diﬀusion matrix.

A remarkably result is that in a ﬁrst approximation the longitudinal and transverse drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients
can be transformed to each other by a simple rescaling, namely, by multiplying the scale of the longitudinal increments
with the factor 3/2. With this rescaling the frequently discussed issue of the diﬀerences between longitudinal and
transverse structure functions can be explained.
In this context the extended self similarity method (ESS) has
to be changed for the transverse structure functions according to the rescaling symmetry, leading to an extended
self-similarity for the transverse increments (ESST). From it, we get the remarkably result that the previous found
diﬀerences in the scaling exponents vanish. Accordingly, the seemingly diﬀerences between the exponents were a
result of the non-scaling behavior. Thus it is evident that with increasing Reynolds number the diﬀerences in the
scaling exponents diminish, as more and more ideal scaling behavior occurs. It is interesting to note that the 3/2
rescaling, which we interpret as diﬀerent speed of the longitudinal and transverse cascade, is compatible with the
K´arm´an equation. This leads to the proposal that the 3/2 rescaling is valid for large Reynolds number Re

Besides the features of structure functions our method of analyzing the statistics by means of a Fokker-Planck
equation, provides further insights in the complexity of the cascading process. Access to stochastic properties on
multi-scales and the interaction between both increments are given. In this closer look principal diﬀerences between
longtidudinal and transverse increments can be identiﬁed, which are not grasped by the investigation with structure
functions. The physical meaning of these diﬀerences has to be clariﬁed for an extended understanding of the small
scale turbulence.

VII. APPENDIX A: EXTENDED SELF SIMILARITY

Benzi et. al. [7, 8] have noticed that structure functions show extended self similarity (ESS) and that this property
can be used to estimate scaling exponents for moderate Reynolds number for which a scaling regime is not well-
developed. The basic assumption of ESS is that the structure functions of diﬀerent order have a similar shape, which
can be written as

n

ur|
h|

i ∝

(rf (r))ξl

n

u3

with the common function f (r). Additionaly it was shown that
if one choses according to Kolmogorov’s 4/5-law ξl

|
3 = 1 one can write ESS in the form
(cid:11)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

and

u3

have the same scaling properties and

(cid:10)
Using this expression, the scaling range extends down to 3η–5η and the exponent is universal, i.e. does not depend
on the Reynolds number.

(cid:11)

For the transverse structure functions ESS was applied in two diﬀerent ways. Some groups have plotted
vr|

ξt
n [13, 48]. But in recent time it has been argued that
i

3

i ∝ h|
is theoretical more justiﬁed because Kolmogorov’s 4/5-law gives an exact prediction for the longitudinal third order
structure function and therefore

is a good point of reference [2, 15, 18, 49, 69].

case u3 = σ the Markov properties are violated. b) The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (dotted line) in comparison

VIII. APPENDIX B: LEFT BOUNDED INCREMENTS

U(x

[U(x + αr)

In the case of multi-point statistics with n increments on diﬀerent scales r1, . . . , rn, one has to deﬁne the relative
position of increments. A general deﬁnition is ur(α) = e
[0, 1]. We call
·
the case α = 1 left-bounded increments and the case α = 1/2 centered increments. The left-bounded increments are
the usual way to deﬁne the relative position of several increments, see for example [37]. Although, for this increment
deﬁnition, the Markov properties are violated as one can see in Fig. 36a). For u3 = 0 the Markov properties are
fulﬁlled. For u3 = σ we get Markov properties around the expected Markov-length, but for larger scales the Markov
properties are violated. Nevertheless, the violation of the Markov properties does not aﬀect the Kramers-Moyal
coeﬃcients very much; even the deviations in du
2 does not eﬀect the total Fokker-Planck equation very much, because
this term is small in comparison to the others, see Fig. 37. The violated Markov properties become more obviously,
if the conditioned moments estimated from the Fokker-Planck equation are compared with those from the data, see
Fig. 36b). It can be seen that the left-bounded increments does not describe the conditional moments. Therefore we
use the centered increments for our analysis. For a discussion on the background of random numbers and random
walks see Ref. [66]

FIG. 37: The expansion coeﬃcients of the Kramers-Moyal coeﬃcients according to eq. (21) for centered and left-bounded
increments. The coeﬃcients for the centered increments (black squares) and the left-bounded increments (white squares) are
equal for the smallest order in u and v, respectively, see a) and b). For the linear and quadratic term of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients
the deviations are signiﬁcant, see c) and d)). But because these two coeﬃcients have only a small contribution to the drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcients, the eﬀective inﬂuence on the Fokker-Planck equation is nevertheless weak.

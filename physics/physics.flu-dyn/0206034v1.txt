Studied using Exact Structure-Function Equations

ABSTRACT. An exact equation is obtained that relates the products of two-point diﬀerences of ﬂuid
velocity and those diﬀerences with the diﬀerence of pressure gradient and other quantities. The averages
of such products are structure functions. Equations that follow from the Navier-Stokes equation and
incompressibility but with no other approximations are called “exact” here. Exact equations for structure
functions are obtained, as is an exact incompressibility condition on the second-order velocity structure
function. Ensemble, temporal, and spatial averages are all considered because they produce diﬀerent sta-
tistical equations and because they respectively apply to theoretical purposes, experiment, and numerical
simulation of turbulence; those applications are addressed herein. The midpoint and the diﬀerence of the
two points at which the hydrodynamic quantities are obtained are X and r; t is time. The equations
are organized in a revealing way by use of X, r, t as independent variables. Dependences on X and on
the orientation of r and on t fade as the asymptotic statistical states of local homogeneity, local isotropy,
and local stationarity, respectively, are approached. The exact equations are thus applicable to study of
the approach toward those asymptotic states. Exact equations obtained by averaging over a sphere in
r-space have a particularly simple form. The case of a simulation that has periodic boundary conditions
leads to particularly simple equations. A new deﬁnition of local homogeneity is contrasted with previous
deﬁnitions. The approach toward the asymptotic state of local homogeneity is studied by using scale anal-
ysis to determine the required approximations and the approximate equations pertaining to experiments
and simulations of the small-scale structure of high-Reynolds-number turbulence, but without invoking
local isotropy. Those equations diﬀer from equations for homogeneous turbulence. The traces of both
exact and approximate equations have particularly simple forms; in particular, the energy dissipation
rate appears in the exact trace equation even without averaging, whereas in previous formulations the
energy dissipation rate appears after averaging and use of local isotropy. The trace mitigates the eﬀect
of anisotropy in the equations, thereby revealing that the trace of the third-order structure function is
expected to be superior for quantifying asymptotic scaling laws.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamic theory of the local structure of turbulence is so named by Monin and Yaglom (1975) (their Sec.
22) to mean the derivation and investigation of equations for structure functions by use of the Navier-Stokes equation.
The structure functions are averages of diﬀerences of basic hydrodynamic quantities such as velocity and pressure
gradient. Monin and Yaglom (1975) pointed out that the dynamic theory gives important relationships between
structure functions, and that these relationships provide important extensions of predictions based on dimensional
analysis and ﬂow similarity. The dynamic theory is the basis for Kolmogorov’s (1941a) famous equation that relates
second-order and third-order velocity structure functions, and is of fundamental importance in the theory of locally
homogeneous and locally isotropic turbulence (Monin and Yaglom, 1975; Batchelor, 1947; Monin, 1959; Frisch, 1995).
The dynamic theory does not uniquely determine the structure functions; this is known as the closure problem
(Monin and Yaglom, 1975). Experimental data have been used to evaluate the balance of Kolmogorov’s equation and
generalizations of it (Antonia, Chambers, and Browne, 1983; Chambers and Antonia, 1984; Lindborg, 1999; Danaila
et al., 1999 a,b; Antonia et al., 2000). This report supports such experimental work, as well as more precise use of
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by giving correct and complete equations to be used in such evaluations.

We derive exact equations for structure functions by use of diﬀerential operator identities. By “exact” we
mean that the equations follow from the Navier-Stokes equation and the incompressibility condition with no additional
approximations. This meaning is emphasized because turbulence researchers consistently use “exact” when they mean
asymptotic. Exact equations satisfy the perceived need by Yaglom (1998) for careful derivation of dynamic-theory
equations and the perceived value placed by Sreenivasan and Antonia (1997) on aspects of turbulence that can be
understood precisely.
In Sec. 2, the equations for products of diﬀerences is developed to the greatest extent possible
before any average is performed. This mathematical method is similar to that used in the theory of wave propagation
in random media where the equations for wave-ﬁeld products are thoroughly developed before an average is performed

2

(see Rytov et al., 1989). Our study is limited to two spatial points and a single time and to the lowest-order equation
of the dynamic theory; that equation includes second- and third-order velocity structure functions. On the other
hand, the mathematical method used is of wider applicability; it is not limited to just two points, a single time, the
lowest-order equation, or to the Navier-Stokes equation alone. For instance, the method could be used to derive an
equation involving a three-point structure function for a scalar quantity having its continuity equation coupled to
the velocity ﬁeld. Such an equation would be useful for interpreting the observed (Mydlarski and Warhaft, 1998;
Sreenivasan, 1991) local anisotropy of scalar ﬁelds in the presence of a mean gradient of the scalar.

The exact equations retain all of the dependence of the structure functions on r, X, and time t, where r is
the vector spacing between two points at which the measurements are obtained within the turbulent ﬂow and X is
the midpoint position of these points. Previous methods (Batchelor, 1956; Lindborg, 1996; Hill, 1997) of deriving
dynamic-theory equations neglected the dependence of statistics on X, and thereby limited the equations to the cases
of homogeneous and locally homogeneous turbulence. To also study the approach toward local homogeneity, equations
are needed that retain X. Here, attention is given to the conditions that must be fulﬁlled for the X-dependence to
be neglected. Previously (Hill, 1997), the approach toward local isotropy was examined, although exact equations
were not then available. Consequently, the approach toward local isotropy is not considered here.

is much less than
a length scale that will be called the outer scale, and to deduce all other required approximations. Such scale analysis
is presented in detail in Sec. 7.4. Our analysis determines approximations that quantify the degree to which the
small-scale structure of turbulence depends on its large-scale structure; such analysis was called for by Yaglom (1998).
Our analysis sets the stage for DNS and experimental studies of the approximations.

A scale analysis is performed to quantify terms that are to be neglected on the basis that

The equations derived in Sections 2 and 3 are exact for every ﬂow, whether laminar or turbulent. For example,
the equations apply exactly to the edge of a jet, to a boundary layer, as well as to those experimental situations
such as grid-generated wind-tunnel turbulence, for which local homogeneity is expected to be most accurate. The
equations apply provided there are no forces on the ﬂuid at the points of measurement. Forces can be applied near the
point of measurement; for instance, the equations are exact for hot-wire anemometer supports just downstream of the
measurement points. The equations apply for turbulence generated at places other than the points of measurement;
examples are grid-generated turbulence measured downstream of the grid, and turbulence generated by rotating
blades (Zocchi et al., 1994). The case of statistically homogeneous forces distributed throughout the ﬂuid has been
considered for the asymptotic case of isotropic turbulence by Novikov (1965) (see also Frisch, 1995). The case of
forces at the points of measurement is considered in Appendix A.
The ensemble average is considered ﬁrst (Sec. 3.1).

It has the advantage for theoretical studies that temporal
and spatial changes can be considered because the ensemble average does not eliminate dependence on X or t. The
temporal average is typically used with experimental data, and the spatial average is typically used for data from
DNS. For this reason, exact equations for both temporal averaging (Sec. 3.2) and spatial averaging (Sec. 3.3) are
also obtained. The connection between the derivations presented here and any experiment or DNS is important
because the equations relate several statistics and therefore are most revealing when data are substituted into them.
A recently developed experimental method (Su and Dahm, 1996) has the potential to thoroughly evaluate terms in
the equations derived here. As shown in Sec. 3.4, the exact equations have a particularly simple form for the case of
DNS with periodic boundary conditions.

The equations can be evaluated with experimental or DNS data to determine the most signiﬁcant terms in the
equations for a given ﬂow and thereby determine the eﬀects that cause deviations from asymptotic laws. The ongoing
interest in turbulence intermittency includes accurate evaluation of inertial-range exponents of structure functions,
for which purpose precise deﬁnition of an observed inertial range is needed. The third-order structure function can
serve this purpose because it has a well-known inertial-range power law and the 4/5 coeﬃcient (Kolmogorov’s (1941a)
4/5 law) in the asymptotic limit of accurate local homogeneity and local isotropy. Deviations from the 4/5 coeﬃcient
are observed in experiments (Anselmet et al., 1984; Mydlarski and Warhaft, 1996, 1998; Lindborg, 1999); this casts
doubt on the precision with which measured exponents apply to the intermittency phenomenon. The equations
derived here, when evaluated with data, can reveal the eﬀects contributing to the deviation from Kolmogorov’s 4/5
law. The usefulness of such evaluations is shown by Lindborg (1999); Danaila et al. (1999 a,b); and Antonia et al.
(2000). They generalize Kolmogorov’s equation by the addition of a term describing streamwise inhomogeneity. To
obtain this term from the present exact analysis, it is necessary to perform the Reynolds decomposition. The present
analysis has the advantage that it reveals all terms that describe inhomogeneity. This is discussed in detail in Sec. 7.
The equations derived here are obtained in the Eulerian framework, which is most useful for experimental evaluation.
Particular attention is given to the typical experimental case that is used to investigate universality of turbulence
statistics at small scales and large Reynolds numbers. We derive the simpliﬁcation of the exact equation that applies
approximately to such experiments. Experimental data typically have the mean velocity subtracted before structure
functions are calculated from the velocity ﬂuctuation. For this reason, we derive the approximate equation obeyed
by structure functions calculated from velocity ﬂuctuations. The Reynolds decomposition (Sec. 5) is essential for

3

this purpose. The derivation is necessarily long in Sec. 7.4, but in this case, the journey is more signiﬁcant than the
destination because all required approximations are determined en route. Local homogeneity is the most important of
the approximations. A necessary condition for local homogeneity is given in Sec. 7.3; it is not a suﬃcient condition.
The trace of the exact equation has a particularly simple form. When averaged over a sphere in r-space, and
when the advective and time-derivative terms are neglected, this equation has the same form as Kolmogorov’s (1941a)
equation (Sec. 4.3). This is true despite the fact that the r-space sphere-averaged equation is valid even for extreme
violations of local isotropy.

1.1 Contrasting Deﬁnitions of Local Homogeneity

Local homogeneity has been given various deﬁnitions by diﬀerent authors. Kolmogorov (1941b) introduced a
space-time domain that is small compared to L and T=(L/U), where L and U are “typical length and velocity for the
ﬂow in the whole.” Kolmogorov considers the two-point diﬀerences of the velocities at spatial points in the domain;
one point is common to all the diﬀerences. Kolmogorov (1941b) deﬁnes local homogeneity as follows:
the joint
probability distribution of the velocity diﬀerences is independent of the one common spatial point, and of the velocity
at the one common point, and of time. Data of Praskovsky et al. (1993), Sreenivasan & Stolovitzky (1996), and
Sreenivasan & Dhruva (1998) contradict the statistical independence of velocity diﬀerence and the velocity at either
end point, as well as contradict the statistical independence of velocity diﬀerence and the velocity at the midpoint.
The exception is isotropic turbulence (Sreenivasan & Dhruva, 1998) for which case local homogeneity is assured. An
alternative possibility that is particularly relevant here is that the two-point velocity sum, un+u′
n might be statistically
independent of velocity diﬀerence, but statements by Sreenivasan & Stolovitzky (1996) and Sreenivasan & Dhruva
(1998) contradict that statistical independence as well; publication of supporting data would be useful. Kolmogorov’s
deﬁnition should not be used because experimental data contradict that statistical independence (Praskovsky et al.,
1993; Sreenivasan and Stolovitzky, 1996; Hill and Wilczak, 2001), as do theoretical considerations (Hill and Wilczak,
2001).

Monin and Yaglom (1975) deﬁne local homogeneity to mean that the joint probability distribution of the two-
spatial-point velocity diﬀerences is unaﬀected by any translation of the spatial points. They do not impose a restriction
on the translations to a spatial domain. It follows (Monin and Yaglom, 1975) that statistics composed entirely of the
diﬀerences obey the same relationships that they do for homogeneous turbulence (namely, they are independent of
where they are measured), and that the mean velocity depends linearly on position. In practice, statistics of diﬀerences
and of derivatives do depend on where they are measured except in the ideal case of homogeneous turbulence. Frisch
(1995) gives a deﬁnition that is equivalent to that of Monin and Yaglom (1975), except that the translations are
restricted to a domain the size of the spatial scale characteristic of the production of turbulent energy (which he calls
the integral scale). Two-point structure-function equations of all orders contain a statistic that is the product of not
only factors of the diﬀerence of the two velocities but also one factor of the sum of the two velocities, i.e., un + u′
n
(Hill, 2001). Because the deﬁnitions of local homogeneity by Monin and Yaglom (1975) and Frisch (1995) involve
only the joint probability distribution of two-point diﬀerences, it follows that those deﬁnitions are not suﬃcient to
simplify structure-function equations to the same level of simpliﬁcation as does homogeneity.

The calculus of homogeneity by Batchelor (1956) is the commutation of spatial derivatives from within an
average to outside the average where they become derivatives with respect to r, and vice versa. The calculus of local
homogeneity by Hill (1997) is a generalization of Batchelor’s calculus; speciﬁcally, local homogeneity was implemented
by neglecting the derivative with respect to X relative to the derivative with respect to r when spatial derivatives
were commuted with the averaging operation. That implementation is restricted to statistics that contain at least
one diﬀerence or derivative of basic hydrodynamic quantities (such as velocity, pressure, temperature, etc.). This
calculus diﬀers from the aforementioned deﬁnitions of local homogeneity in that no translational invariance is required
other than for the inﬁnitesimal displacement in X implied by the derivative operation.
In Appendix C, examples are
given that show how this calculus produces the predictions of homogeneity for the homogeneous case. To simplify
the structure-function equations, Hill (1997, 2001) found that it was necessary to apply that calculus to statistics of
products containing not only at least one diﬀerence but also quantities that were not diﬀerences.

Consider grid-generated turbulence in a wind tunnel operated with constant mean velocity. For anemometers
ﬁxed relative to the position of the grid, the turbulence is stationary and streamwise inhomogeneous. For simplicity,
For anemometers moving relative to the grid in a direction parallel to
ignore the cross-stream inhomogeneity.
the streamwise direction, the turbulence is both streamwise inhomogeneous and nonstationary.
It is nonstationary
because of downstream decay of the turbulence intensity. That example raises the question as to whether or not local
stationarity and local homogeneity should be combined into a single deﬁnition that is independent of the motion of
the coordinate system.
In this author’s opinion such a combined deﬁnition is neither desirable nor practical. Thus,
local homogeneity (or local stationarity) must be considered in a given coordinate system.

2. EXACT TWO-POINT EQUATIONS

Exact equations are given here that relate two-point quantities and that are obtained from the Navier-Stokes
equations and incompressibility. The two spatial points are denoted x and x′; they are independent variables: they
have no relative motion; e.g., anemometers at x and x′ are ﬁxed relative to one another. To be concise, velocities are
i = ui(x′, t), and the same notation is used for other quantities. p(x, t) is the pressure divided
denoted ui = ui(x, t), u′
by the density (density is constant), ν is kinematic viscosity, and ∂ denotes partial diﬀerentiation with respect to its
subscript variable. Summation is implied by repeated Roman indices; e.g., ∂xn∂xn is the Laplacian operator. For

3. EXACT AVERAGED EQUATIONS

3.1 Exact Equations: Ensemble Average

The ensemble is deﬁned as a set of similar ﬂows. An example is a set of mechanically identical wind tunnels
operated with the same forcing. Points x and x′ are deﬁned in each ﬂow relative to the mechanical structures or
relative to the corresponding locations where the ﬂow is (or was) forced. Time t is deﬁned for each ﬂow from the
start of the forcing. Thus, the space-time points (x, x′, t), or equivalently (X, r, t), are in complete correspondence
between ﬂows in the ensemble. The ensemble average is deﬁned at each point (X, r, t) as the arithmetical average
over the ensemble. We denote the ensemble average by angle brackets
h◦iE, where the subscript E is a mnemonic
for ‘ensemble.’ Deﬁne the following statistics:

≡ h
≡ h

Dij (X, r, t)
Eij (X, r, t)

dij iE , Dijn (X, r, t)
eijiE , W (X, r, t)
≡ h
The argument list (X, r, t) is shown above to emphasize that the average applies to the general case of nonstationary,
inhomogeneous turbulence, and that the ensemble average does not eliminate dependence on any independent variable.
The argument list (X, r, t) is suppressed where clarity does not suﬀer. Deﬁning the symbols Dij, Dijn, Tij, Eij, W ,
and Fijn causes brief notation in later sections. Because the ensemble average is a summation, it commutes with
diﬀerential operators, and the average of (15) is therefore

3.2 Exact Equations: Temporal Average

The ensemble average used above is important because it allows us to simultaneously investigate rapid temporal
variation that a temporal average would smooth and to investigate sharp spatial variation that a spatial average would
smooth.
It is important to consider temporal and spatial averages because they are typical of experiments and DNS,
respectively. Of course, an ensemble average can be approximated by widely separated temporal or spatial sampling
for stationary or homogeneous turbulence, respectively. However, nearly continuous sampling is typical. Thus, we
represent the temporal and spatial averages by integrals, but all results are valid for the sum of discrete points as
well. The temporal average is most meaningful when the turbulence is nearly stationary, and the spatial average is
most meaningful for nearly homogeneous turbulence.

right-hand sides clearly do not depend on r, whereas this is not obvious in (35) and (36). The only dependence of
(41) and (42) is on t. Thus, (t) on the right-hand side of (41)-(42) is the entire argument list.

Of course, these results follow from the periodic boundary conditions and the fact that the averaging volume

is over the whole periodic structure of the DNS domain. These results follow from the symmetry of that case.

4. AVERAGES OVER THE r-SPACE SPHERE

4.1 Deﬁnition of the r-Space Sphere Average and the Orientation Average

The energy dissipation rate averaged over a sphere in r-space has been a recurrent theme in small-scale similarity
theories since its introduction by Obukhov (1962) and Kolmogorov (1962). By averaging our equations for the trace,
we can, for the ﬁrst time, produce an exact dynamical equation containing the sphere-averaged energy dissipation
rate. The volume average over an r-space sphere of radius rS of a quantity Q is denoted by

The orientation average over the surface of the r-space sphere of radius rS of a vector qn (X, r, t) is denoted as follows:

Because r, X, and t are independent variables, the r-space volume and orientation averages commute with time and

averages as well. For instance,

4.2 Example of an Equation Operated upon by the r-Space Sphere Average

The r-sphere average (43) can operate on the structure-function equations (21), (22), (27), (28), (32), (33),
(35), (36), (65), (70), (66), (67); indeed, it can operate on the unaveraged equations (15) and (16) as well. These

equations have terms of the form ∂rn qn; examples are:
means of (45), the volume average in r-space of any term of the form ∂rn qn produces the orientation average of qn
within the subject equation. After operating on (22) with the volume average in r-space (43), the right-most term in
that equation contains

The result of the r-space sphere average of any of our equations will be clear from operating on the simplest
equation, namely, (36) for the case of periodic DNS. The average of (36) over a sphere in r-space of radius rS and
multiplication by rS/3 and use of (41) gives

for the freely decaying DNS case considered; (46) applies to inhomogeneous and anisotropic DNS having periodic
boundary conditions.

For the time average (26), the mean velocity is Ui(x, t0, T )

that the mean depends on the start, t0, and duration, T , of the time average, as well as on x. The Reynolds
decomposition is ui(x, t)
iT = 0. Clearly the ﬂuctuation,

ui(x, t, t0, T ), also depends on t0 and T as well as on x and t, and (51) is valid because the time average commutes

For the space average (30), it follows from (6) that when the integral over X operates on a single-point quantity
like ui(x, t), it is an integral over x such that (30) produces a function only of t but not of X or r. Thus, the mean
velocity is Ui(t, R)
R; as in (30) this average depends on the centroid and shape of the averaging volume,
ui(x, t, R), which
but this dependence is not denoted explicitly. The Reynolds decomposition is ui(x, t)
R = 0. Clearly, (51) is valid for the space average.

n) ∂Xn Dij becomes the same expression that Lindborg (1999) [his
Eq.(8)] deduced as an addition to Kolmogorov’s equation. His deduction was based on Galilean invariance applied to
a uniform mean ﬂow. The combination of (52) and (21) shows that both ∂tDij and 1
n) ∂Xn Dij must appear
in the dynamical equation as was correctly deduced by Lindborg (1999) on the basis of mean-ﬂow Galilean invariance,
but replacing ∂tDij with 1
n) ∂Xn Dij, as was done by Danaila et al.
(1999 a,b) on the basis of Taylor’s
hypothesis, does not preserve that invariance. Now, ∂Xn Dij is a measure of inhomogeneity because ∂Xn Dij is the
rate of change of Dij (X, r, t) with respect to where the average is performed. Thus, 1
n) ∂Xn Dij describes
the eﬀect of the ﬂuid moving relative to the anemometers in a direction in which Dij (X, r, t) is inhomogeneous.
Lindborg (1999) quantiﬁes the contribution of 1

several experiments and thereby shows that the contribution can be signiﬁcant.

in (52). From (53) this term is important if there is
strong correlation between velocity diﬀerence and velocity sum. One such case is when at least one anemometer is
at the edge of a jet and is therefore sometimes immersed in quiescent entrained ﬂuid and sometimes in turbulently
agitated ﬂuid. More generally, the second term in (52) is important for the case of large-scale structures. This
term describes a contribution caused by inhomogeneity in the direction transverse to the mean ﬂow direction as well
as in the streamwise direction. Thus, this term is expected to contribute for pipe and jet ﬂows when anemometers

7. APPROXIMATE EQUATIONS PERTAINING TO EXPERIMENTS ON THE SMALL-SCALE
STRUCTURE OF HIGH-REYNOLDS-NUMBER TURBULENCE

We are now in a position to investigate three closely related objectives that will be considered simultaneously.
One objective is to study the simpliﬁcation of (21) on the basis of data for the small-scale structure of high-Reynolds-
number turbulence; another is to determine the approximations required for that simpliﬁcation. The third objective
is to obtain from (21) an equation that is closer to the measurement process of extracting a mean velocity from
anemometry data. We use the ensemble-averaged equations because they retain both temporal and spatial variability.
Here, we consider the approach toward local homogeneity. For this purpose, our equations that depend on the location
of measurements, i.e., X, are needed. We also consider the approach toward local stationarity, so the dependence on t
is needed. The restrictions required by local isotropy are not used, so dependence on the orientation of measurement,
i.e., r/r, is retained. On the other hand, assumptions about the order of magnitude of some quantities require that
local isotropy is not greatly violated. The data used for this investigation are given in Appendix B, which includes
the empirically veriﬁed (Monin and Yaglom, 1975) formulas for the inertial and viscous ranges for components of Dij
and Dijn.

7.3 A Necessary Condition for Local Homogeneity

We must deﬁne several scaling parameters determined by the ﬂow. The integral scale, as traditionally deﬁned,
is strictly applicable only to homogeneous turbulence; see, for example, Tennekes and Lumley (1972). Here, however,
we are studying inhomogeneous turbulence. As an example of the diﬃculty of deﬁning integral scales in general
inhomogeneous turbulence, consider the horizontally homogeneous atmospheric surface during daytime convective
conditions.
It is diﬃcult to imagine a useful integral scale deﬁned using data obtained along a line from the ground
to the upper reaches of the surface layer. However, the horizontal homogeneity and Taylor’s hypothesis allow integral
scales to be deﬁned for all three velocity components measured at a point. Using surface-layer data, Kaimal et al.
(1976) show that the horizontal velocity components scale with the depth of the entire boundary layer; that depth
can be 1 to 2 km. Unlike the horizontal velocity component, the vertical velocity variance obeys Monin-Obukhov
similarity such that its integral scale is proportional to the height above ground (Kaimal et al., 1976). For our study
of the approach toward local homogeneity, it is necessary to deﬁne the large scale as the smallest of the integral scales
or of the distance to boundaries. From the example of the atmospheric surface layer, that scale is the height above
ground. Denote this chosen length scale by L and call it the outer scale. This name distinquishes it from the integral
scale, which might not exist as traditionally deﬁned in terms of the integral of a velocity correlation function.
It is
useful to deﬁne a velocity scale υ by

Monin and Yaglom (1975) and Tennekes and Lumley (1972) determine that υ is an estimate of the root-mean-square
velocity, and that the mean shear is not greater than υ/L. If this is not so for our chosen outer scale L, then L can be
adjusted to make it so. From studies of nearly homogeneous turbulence, the right-hand side of (56) is proportional
to velocity variance and the proportionality constant is independent of Reynolds number at high enough Reynolds
numbers (Sreenivasan, 1998; Pearson, Krogstad, and van de Water, 2002). The proportionality constant is of order
unity and depends somewhat on the large-scale structure of the ﬂow (Sreenivasan, 1998; Pearson, Krogstad, and van
de Water, 2002).

We deﬁne the scale ℓ by

typical of the viscous range, is deﬁned by

The basic tenet of local homogeneity is that as r is reduced relative to L, nonlinear randomization causes
statistics of diﬀerences of basic hydrodynamic quantities to decrease their dependence on the large-scale ﬂow structure.
For r < ℓ and as r is further reduced, the nonlinear randomization is increasingly opposed by the smoothing eﬀect
of viscosity. Therefore, ℓ

where L is the outer scale. We study the approach toward local homogeneity by using (58) in scale analyses. We
do so in Sec. 7.4, and ﬁnd that some predictions of local homogeneity (such as ∂Xn Fijn = 0 and ∂rnDjn = 0) do not
follow solely on the basis of the necessary condition (58). Thus, (58) is not a suﬃcient condition for local homogeneity.
Suppose for the moment that the turbulence under investigation is suﬃciently homogenous that an integral
scale L can be deﬁned in terms of an integral of the velocity correlation function. The microscale Reynolds number
(Tennekes and Lumley, 1972) Rλ is well known to be related to integral scale L and η by L/η ∝ R3/2

Lumley, 1972). Then, (57) gives L/ℓ ∝ R3/2

In a general inhomogeneous turbulence case, we

iE. Hence, when (60) is substituted in (21), the ﬁrst
term in (60) can be neglected relative to the diagonal element Eαα on the basis of (58). The second, third, and
fourth terms in (60) introduce oﬀ-diagonal elements of
Dij into the diagonal elements of (21). Using (B1) and the
assumption (see Appendix B) that the oﬀ-diagonal elements of Dij are no greater than the Dαα, the second, third,
and fourth terms in (60) can be shown to be no greater than of order (r/L)2/3 relative to

neglected on the basis of (58). The same procedure can be used for the ﬁfth and sixth terms in (60). On the other

Now consider the term ∂tDij in (21). Recall that the positions of the anemometers, namely x and x′, are

anemometer’s rest frame. The sum of ∂tDαα and 1
n) ∂Xn Dαα [see (62)] is the time rate of change of Dαα
in the reference frame moving with velocity (U + U′) /2; that is, moving with the ﬂuid in the sense of moving with
the local and momentary ensemble-averaged velocity. Now (21) is exact and therefore describes cases that include
rapid changes of mean conditions in the rest frame of the anemometers. However, assume that the experimenter
has chosen a case for which mean conditions are nearly constant in the anemometer’s rest frame; examples include
ﬁxed anemometer positions in a wind tunnel, pipe, or jet for constant mean ﬂow, or freely decaying DNS. From the

As shown above, derivation of (65) and (66) from the exact equation (21) requires more than just (58). A further
requirement is that the experimenter avoids cases having large spatial and temporal variation of the mean ﬂow.
Of course, that choice improves the accuracy of local homogeneity for ﬁxed values of [max (r, ℓ) /L]. Additional
requirements are approximations (B13) and (B10), and that the inverse Reynolds number (υL/ν)−1 is very small.
In general, those conditions are typical of an experimental situation that is sought for the study of the universality
of turbulence statistics at small scales. Most experiments use Taylor’s hypothesis to estimate spatial statistics from
temporal statistics, for which purpose
/υ must be large. For this reason, the left-most term is not neglected in
(65), nor in (66).

Of course, (65) contains no information about the oﬀ-diagonal elements of (21). We cannot evaluate those
oﬀ-diagonal elements because we lack the necessary data. Clearly, DNS or a very complete experiment (e.g., as in Su
and Dahm, 1996)) could be used to quantify those oﬀ-diagonal elements. The oﬀ-diagonal elements of (21) describe
quantities that approach zero as local isotropy becomes accurate.

9. DISCUSSION

18

Given data for which local homogeneity and/or local isotropy are approximate, it seems that (22) is closer to
that asymptotic case than is (21), and therefore, that data for the trace Diin will more accurately show the asymptotic
inertial-range power law than does D111. The reason is as follows. For the approach toward local isotropy in
homogeneous turbulence, the anisotropy quantiﬁed by nonzero values of Tij is balanced by that from the term ∂rn Dijn
iE = 0
in (21) (Hill, 1997). The trace of Tij vanishes exactly for the homogeneous case because ∂Xi h

by anisotropy than is ∂rn Dijn, and therefore, that Diin is less aﬀected by anisotropy than is Dijn. This hypothesis
should be checked by comparison with DNS. Evaluation of all terms in (22) and (21) are the basis for such an
investigation. We therefore expect that inertial-range power-law scaling would be more evident in Dii1 than in D111.
Of course, performing the trace requires that all three components of velocity be measured at both x and x′.

To determine scaling properties of the third-order structure function, past theory has used the isotropic-tensor
formula to produce a diﬀerential equation having the operator ∂r and integration of that equation (as done in Sec. 4.3).
However, one can use an equation like (28) without an assumption about the symmetry properties (e.g., isotropic) of
the structure functions by means of the sphere average in r-space, as implemented in Sec. 4.2. Evaluating resultant
terms in the r-space sphere-averaged equation implies a tedious experimental procedure if wire anemometers are used.
On the other hand, both DNS and the experimental method of Su and Dahm (1996) are suited to such evaluation.
In eﬀect, the r-space sphere average solves the equation by producing the orientation-averaged third-order structure
It would seem that the orientation average mitigates anisotropy eﬀects. Thus, the orientation average
function.
Dii1, is expected to best exhibit properties of locally
of the trace of the third-order structure function, namely,

10. CONCLUSION

The mathematical method of deriving exact structure-function equations from the Navier-Stokes equation is
developed. The basic tools are the change of variables (6) and the derivative identities (7) and (8) and algebra.
Manipulations are performed to the greatest extent possible (in Sec. 2) before an average is performed. Then,
exactly deﬁned ensemble, time, and spatial averages are used. DNS makes study of exact structure-function equations
practical. Also, experimental methods exist (Su and Dahm, 1995) that can completely evaluate terms in the exact
structure-function equations. Exact incompressibility relationships, such as (24) and (25), are obtained. Following
from the discussion in Sec. 9, the exact incompressibility relationship (24) will have a nonzero value at small r
because of large-scale structures in the ﬂow. At small r, (25) is approximately the second derivative with respect to
measurement location of the velocity covariance, and therefore clearly depends on ﬂow inhomogeneity.

That the exact structure-function equations are an advance can be seen from previous work.

It is no longer
necessary to derive individual terms that describe eﬀects of inhomogeneity that are missing from equations valid only
for homogeneous turbulence, such as was done by Lindborg (1999). All such terms are now known. Sreenivasan
and Dhruva (1998) note that one could determine scaling exponents with greater conﬁdence if one has a theory
that exhibits not only the asymptotic power law but also the trend toward the power law, and that without such
a theory the method of computing local slopes is a “misplaced delusion.” The exact equations given here are the

required theory for the third-order structure function, given that data must be used to evaluate the equations in a
manner analogous to previous evaluations in Antonia, Chambers, and Browne (1983), Chambers and Antonia (1984),
Lindborg (1999), Danaila et al. (1999 a,b), and Antonia et al. (2000). The exact dynamical equations obtained here
are useful for studies of the approach toward local homogeneity as well as to local isotropy. Toward that end, a scale
analysis is given in Sec. 7.4, which leads to the approximate equations in Sec. 8. The exact equations provide insight
into the time-derivative terms, as discussed in Sec. 6.

Appendix A: Forced Turbulence

The Navier-Stokes equation (13) and the exact structure-function equations [e.g., (21)] apply to cases in which
the turbulence is forced at places other than at the points of observation x and x′, such as grid-generated turbulence,
pipe ﬂow, and boundary layers. Also, the Navier-Stokes equation (13) and (21) apply to freely decaying DNS such
as that by Boratav and Pelz (1997) and the simulation of laboratory experiments as in de Bruyn Kops and J. J. Riley
(1998). Some DNS employ spatially distributed forces to drive the turbulence to a steady state. The Navier-Stokes

equation (13), and the exact equations derived from it, do not apply to that case; instead, such forces must be
introduced into (13) and the resultant additional terms derived for the exact structure-function equations.

If a force fi is added to the right-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equation (13), then the term to be added to

Forced turbulence is temporally intermittent such that a space average, e.g.,

R = 0.
The temporal intermittency observed by Borue and Orszag (1996) illustrates this fact; of particular relevance is the
observation of repeated events characterized by accumulation of space-averaged energy in their mean ﬂow (deﬁned by a
surface average in their calculation), followed by a burst of transfer of energy from their mean ﬂow to the space-averaged
can

be neglected; the time average has the eﬀect of averaging the temporal intermittency. Now, apply to (71) the r-sphere
volume average (43). Consider the case in which the Reynolds number is large enough that rS is in the inertial range,
then we can neglect the term proportional to ν in (71), and as shown in the preceding paragraph, any forcing term can
iT rS
(recall that this is based on neglecting the time-derivative and viscous terms in (71) and the forcing because the
forcing has no small-scale spatial variation and is therefore negligible in our scale analysis). A similar generalization
of Kolmogorov’s 4/5 law, namely,
iE r, was obtained in Lindborg (1996), Frisch (1995), and Hill
(1997) for the inertial range of homogeneous, anisotropic turbulence.

1 denote projection in the direction r/r, e.g., D11
(ri/r) (rj/r) Dij. Let subscript β denote projection in either
the ˘ı or ˘e directions (we need not distinguish which direction), e.g., Dββ1 is either ˘ıi˘ıj (rk/r) Dijk or ˘ei˘ej (rk/r) Dijk,
but not ˘ei˘ıj (rk/r) Dijk.
If a distinction need not be made as to the direction of projection, then subscript α is used;
thus, Dαα is either D11 or Dββ. No summation is implied by repeated Greek indices. A unit vector ˘a in an arbitrary
direction is a linear combination of the unit vectors r/r, ˘ı, and ˘e. Thus, if projections of a quantity have the same

≡

22

(B1)
(B2)

order of magnitude and sign in all three directions r/r, ˘ı, and ˘e, then the projection in an arbitrary direction ˘a also
has that order of magnitude.

For the inertial range we use the formulas

The dimensionless coeﬃcient functions, Kαα (X, r, t), K111 (X, r, t), and K1ββ (X, r, t), are included to emphasize
that our inertial-range data, like real data, need not be precisely homogeneous, locally isotropic, or stationary. The
coeﬃcient functions are assumed to be of the order of unity, and when diﬀerentiating the structure functions with
respect to ri, the derivatives of the coeﬃcient functions are assumed to be negligible compared to the derivative of
r2/3 in (B1) and r in (B2). As motivation for this assumption, consider that for the case of local isotropy the above
coeﬃcient functions are constants between 2.7 and 0.26. The choice to scale with ℓ
10η, rather than with η, causes
the coeﬃcient functions to be of the order of unity.

≡

The slight eﬀect of intermittency on the exponent 2/3 in (B1) is not of concern here. Of more signiﬁcance is
the ﬁnding by Mydlarski and Warhaft (1996) of power-law ranges that are precursors to the inertial range. Their
precursor power-law exponents are smaller than the 2/3 exponent of the inertial range, and the precursor exponents
approach 2/3 as Reynolds number increases. Our scale analysis can be extended to apply for those weaker power
laws; the accuracy of the scaling condition would be correspondingly weakened.

Using ℓ deﬁned in (57), the viscous-range formulas for the scale analysis are

≡

For r between the inertial and viscous ranges, the structure functions Dαα, D111, and D1ββ have monotonic
transitions between the asymptotic formulas (B1), (B2), and (B3), (B4). Therefore, if a quantity is negligible on the
basis of both (B1), (B2), and (B3), (B4), then it is negligible for all r from within the inertial range to within the
viscous range.

Of course, this is not true for the sum of diagonal components because of (12). It is likely that the right side of (B10)
is much smaller than the left side, but a more restrictive condition than (B10) is not needed. On the basis of DNS,

Relationships (B1)-(B13) serve as exemplary data in the scale analysis. The fact that we have data only
for projections in an arbitrary direction ˘a means that we can investigate only the diagonal components of (21).
The oﬀ-diagonal components, which are obtained by projection in two orthogonal directions, cannot be studied
here. Relationships like (B1)-(B9) are most often associated with the assumption of local isotropy. However, like
anemometry data, these relationships can be fulﬁlled for coeﬃcient functions [as deﬁned in (B1)-(B4)] of the order of
unity without the speciﬁc restrictions of local isotropy being precisely fulﬁlled. For instance, for Dij, the restrictions
for local isotropy are that its oﬀ-diagonal elements are zero, and that ˘ıi˘ıjDij = ˘ei˘ejDij, and that D11 is related to
Dββ by an incompressibility condition.
In the scale analysis, such restrictions are not used; therefore, local isotropy
is not assumed.

Appendix C: Homogeneity Implemented Using the Calculus of Local Homogeneity

Although homogeneity is mentioned only brieﬂy in this study, it is useful to introduce it and to show how
the calculus of local homogeneity produces the predictions of homogeneity for the case of homogeneous turbu-
lence. Homogeneity is the approximation that ensemble averages do not depend on the position at which the
average is obtained (Monin and Yaglom, 1975). That position being X, we implement this approximation by

In Sec. 3.3 the spatial average is a volume average in X-space such that the equations [e.g., (32) and (33)] do
not contain ∂Xn operating on an average. For those spatially averaged equations, homogeneity can be implemented
by neglecting any average over the surface bounding the averaging volume of the surface-normal component of any
vector. The basis for this implementation is that there are no net average ﬂuxes in homogeneous turbulence.

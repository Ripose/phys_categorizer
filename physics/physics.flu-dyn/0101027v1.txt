Remarks on unsolved basic problems of the Navier–Stokes
equations

Abstract

There is renewed interest in the question of whether
the Navier–Stokes equations (NSE), one of the fun-
damental models of classical physics and widely
used in engineering applications, are actually self-
consistent. After recalling the essential physical as-
sumptions inherent in the NSE, the notion of weak
solutions, possible implications for the energy con-
servation law, as well as existence and uniqueness
in the incompressible case are discussed. Emphasis
will be placed on the possibility of ﬁnite time sin-
gularities and their consequences for length scales
which should be consistent with the continuum hy-
pothesis.

1 Introduction

As computational ﬂuid dynamics makes progress to-
wards the simulation of realistic three-dimensional
ﬂows, the validity of the Navier–Stokes equations
(NSE) can be tested in a more and more reﬁned
way. To put it from an applied point of view: Be-
fore experiments in wind tunnels are substituted by
computer simulations, one should make sure that
the underlying theory is at least self-consistent. As
a matter of fact, after the classical mathematical
work by Leray [1], Hopf [2], Ladyzhenskaya [3], Ser-
rin [4], Temam [5], to refer to important contribu-
tions in the ﬁeld, there is renewed interest in the

fundamentals of the NSE, see for instance the mono-
graph of Doering and Gibbon [6], or a series of pa-
pers by Lions [7] and references therein.

This contribution focuses on the question of self-
consistency which arises, when one of the assump-
tions inherent to the NSE, namely the continuum
hypothesis,
is confronted with the length scales
emerging from solutions of the deterministic NSE.
First, the NSE will be brieﬂy derived from physical
principles with due attention paid to the continuum
hypothesis. After recalling the notion of weak solu-
tions, the state of the art of mathematical existence
and uniqueness proofs will be indicated. The impli-
cation of weak solutions upon energy conservation
will be discussed. The possibility of ﬁnite time sin-
gularities will be related to length scales and thus
to the problem of self-consistency.

2 Derivation of the NSE

The NSE are based on the conservation of mass and
on Newton’s second law. In addition, the more spe-
cial assumption of a so–called Newtonian ﬂuid is
adopted, which is justiﬁed in a great many cases
of hydrodynamic ﬂows. To formulate the conserva-
tion laws it is customary to pick out a connected
cluster of molecules contained in volume Vt which
is deformed in time and translated according to the
local velocity v(x, t) of the ﬂow. Time derivatives
of corresponding magnitudes are conveniently eval-
uated by means of the Reynolds transport theorem

which if ρ = ρ0 is constant, leads to the incompress-

div(v) = 0.

(4)

Newton’s second law implies that any change in mo-
mentum is caused by external forces which in con-
tinuum physics are described by the volume force
density f (e.g. gravity) and by a tensorial force Π.
This tensor reﬂects the inﬂuence of the adjacent
ﬂuid on a given ﬂuid particle. The momentum bal-
ance reads

in the hydrostatic case, from the so–called stress

The Newtonian ﬂuid assumption now amounts to
the following linear relations between T and the

where µ and ν are macroscopic viscosity parame-

after making use of mass conservation we can write
down the momentum balance as follows

Here Vt is an arbitrary local space volume. To be
sure of the existence of the above integral, one may
adopt the suﬃcient conditions that the following
ﬁelds are locally square integrable

As will be discussed later on, there may arise dif-

where p is determined through the incompressibility
condition div(v) = 0.

3 Continuum assumptions and

length scales

The NSE describe macroscopic physical quantities
which constitute mean values with respect to the
underlying atomic degrees of freedom. The den-
sity ρ(x, t) at the space point x, for instance, has
to be understood as an average over some volume
∆V centered at x.
If ∆V is chosen too small, a

2

single measurement of ρ may largely deviate from
its mean value due to molecular ﬂuctuations. An
estimate for a physically reasonable lower bound of
∆V can be deduced from the mean thermal den-
sity ﬂuctuation ∆ρ as given in standard textbooks
of thermodynamics [8]

∆ρ
ρ

=

kT κ
∆V

s

(14)

where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute
temperature and κ the compressibility. If we require
the relative ﬂuctuation ∆ρ/ρ to be smaller than,
say 10−3, at T = 300◦ Kelvin, then we ﬁnd that
the diameter d of the volume ∆V should be d ≥
3 · 10−7m for air, or d ≥ 10−8m for water.

As an implication, if solutions of the deterministic
NSE turn out to vary on a space scale much smaller
than the above lower bounds, then we are outside
of the validity domain of these equations. Here is
the point where the self-consistency problem arises.
In the turbulent regime, length scales decrease
with increasing Reynolds number R. As is listed
e.g. in [6], the Kolmogorov length δK below which
eddies are destroyed by dissipation,
is given by
δK = L/R3/4 where L is a typical external length,
e.g. the diameter of the containment. As another
example the thickness δB of a turbulent boundary
layer scales as δB ∼ L/(R log R). If L = 1 cm, then
δK and δB reach the continuum limit at R ≈ 106.

4 Weak solutions and energy bal-

ance

Since Leray’s pioneering work [1], one has been
looking for generalized solutions v(x, t) of the in-
compressible NSE in the space time domain Ωτ :=
Ω × [0, τ ] with the following properties:

v(x, t = 0) = α(x),
v|∂Ω = 0,
div(v) = 0.

(15)

(16)

(17)

The above equations correspond to the initial con-
dition, no-slip boundary condition and incompress-
ibility, respectively. To establish weak solutions,

test vector ﬁelds Φ ∈ S are introduced with the
following properties

D := {Φ| Φ ∈ D(Ω);

div(Φ) = 0 }

(18)

where D(Ω) is the Schwartz space (C∞ and com-
pact support in Ω). Now v(x, t) is called a weak
solution if it is locally square integrable and if the
following projections of the NSE and the continu-
ity equation hold for every Φ ∈ D and for every
C 1 scalar function φ with compact support in Ω,
respectively [4]

sure term dropped out in (19) due to the solenoidal

As should be noticed, even if the condition (21)
on the external ﬁeld f holds for arbitrarily large τ ,
uniqueness can be guaranteed by the above theorem
only for the smaller time interval t ∈ [0, τ1]. While
this is typical in space dimension three, one has
τ1 = τ in the case of two-dimensional ﬂows.

Which price do we have to pay for accepting weak
solutions? To discuss a possible implication for en-
ergy conservation, we recall the notion of weak and
strong convergence of a sequence of real functions
a(1), a(2), ..a(N ), ... This sequence is called to con-
verge weakly against the function a∗,

Here, the equality sign is guaranteed only in the

To derive the energy balance for a sequence of
approximations v(N ) which converge weakly against
a solution v∗ of (19), we use basis functions Φ(ν) ∈
D with the properties (18) as

(27)

E∗(t) denotes the energy corresponding to the weak
solution

v∗ ≡ v(N ) + r(N )
where r(N ) is the remainder to the approximate ﬁeld
v(N ). We now insert into (19) the above expression

(28)

for the weak solution v∗ together with the test ﬁeld
Φ = v(N ) ∈ D and obtain

The above surface integral vanishes because vN ∈
D. It should be noticed that eq.(29) holds true for
any cutoﬀ N ; it follows strictly from the deﬁnition
(19) of a weak solution; in particular, no approxi-
mate projection scheme was adopted as is common
in Galerkin representations.

In the case of strong solutions with v∗ ∈ W 2
2
in the space time domain Ωτ , one can show that
R(N ) → 0 in the limit N → ∞ so that we would
have the physically plausible energy balance

or in words: the kinetic energy at time τ plus the

However, if v∗ is a weak solution, then we have
only the property of boundedness of the integrals
in (29) and (30), except for the fk-integrals and the
initial energy E(N )(0) which converges under the
assumptions speciﬁed in Theorem A. Making use of
the inequality (25) we can write

limit

If I(τ ) exists only up to some time τ ∗, then
kDvk∞ is singular at t = τ ∗ in a way, that there
is at least one space point x0 ∈ Ω, where one of
the components ∂vi/∂xk diverges, for instance as
follows

Thus, in the case of weak solutions there may be
unphysical sources or sinks (depending on the sign
of R∗ − L∗) of kinetic energy due to the presence
of singularities. The latter are connected with the
space gradients of the velocity ﬁeld, since E(N )(t),
t ∈ (0, τ ) can be shown to converge under rather
general assumptions, see also [9]. If R∗ − L∗ < 0,
then the kinetic energy E∗(t) is smaller than phys-
ically expected; this is known as Leray inequality,
see e.g. p. 104 of [6].

5 Uniqueness and ﬁnite time sin-

gularities

As already mentioned, one gets square integrable
solutions v under rather general assumptions on the
external data. The main basic problem of the NSE
is related to uniqueness which so far is tied to the
existence of the following time integral, for a recent
discussion see [6],

I(τ ) :=

with the supremum norm

kDvk∞ := max

(36)

The origin of this integral will be indicated in the
Appendix. Up to now, in three dimensions the ex-
istence of I(τ ) has been corroborated only for ﬁnite
time intervals τ . If I(τ ) exists for arbitrarily large
τ , then both uniqueness and existence of weak solu-
tions can be established for arbitrarily large times
under quite general conditions.

t < τ ∗, γ ≥ 1.

(37)
Since for t near τ ∗ the behaviour (37) implies
changes of the velocity ﬁeld over arbitrarily small
length scales, it is in conﬂict with the continuum
assumption. The length scales are then small com-
pared to the diameter of the volume ∆V of a
ﬂuid particle with the consequence that microscopic
molecular forces come into play and can no longer
be neglected. In other words we are then out of the
validity domain of the deterministic NSE and we
would have to consider stochastic forces in addition
to the deterministic external forces. It is therefore
not yet settled, whether the phenomenon of hydro-
dynamic turbulence is a manifestation of determin-
istic chaos alone.

As should be noted, the problem of ﬁnite time
singularities cannot be overcome by some averaging
recipe, because the existence of I(τ ) is connected to
the uniqueness of solutions as a suﬃcient condition,
and it may turn out to be also necessary.

Similarly, in the case of compressible ﬂows ﬁnite
time singularities could not be excluded so far [7].
The proof or disproof of the existence of ﬁnite time
singularities constitute one of the basic unsolved
problems in the analysis of the NSE. In the inviscid
case of the Euler equation, there is a general ar-
gument for possible ﬁnite time singularities, see for
instance Frisch [10]. From a direct numerical sim-
ulation of the Euler equations, Grauer and Sideris
[11] recently reported on evidence for a singularity
of the type as given in (37) with γ = 1.

In the following it is sketched how the integral
I(τ ) shows up in uniqueness proofs, see [6]. At vari-
ance with [6] we do not adopt periodic boundary
conditions. Let us assume there are two diﬀerent
solutions v and v′ of the NSE (13). Then we deﬁne
u := v − v′ and obtain after subtracting the NSE
for v and v′

When this equation is scalarly multiplied by u and
integrated over the volume Ω, then, apart from the

This result tells that, since the two supposed solu-

therefore u(0) = 0, we have u(t) = 0 for times
t ∈ (0, τ ) for which I(t) exists. This conclusion
holds true also in the inviscid limit ν0 → 0.

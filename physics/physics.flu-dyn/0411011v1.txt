Water waves over a time-dependent bottom: Exact description for 2D potential ﬂows

V. P. Ruban∗
Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, 2 Kosygin Street, 119334 Moscow, Russia
(Dated: October 23, 2012)

Two-dimensional potential ﬂows of an ideal ﬂuid with a free surface are considered in situations
when shape of the bottom depends on time due to external reasons. Exact nonlinear equations
describing surface waves in terms of the so called conformal variables are derived for an arbitrary
time-evolving bottom parameterized by an analytical function. An eﬃcient numerical method for
the obtained equations is suggested.

1. Introduction

2. Exact nonlinear equations

The theory of water waves now is among the most ac-
tively developing branches of the hydrodynamic science
(see, for instance, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
In par-
13, 14, 15, 16], and many references therein).
ticular, two-dimensional (2D) ﬂows of an ideal incom-
pressible ﬂuid with a free surface are very attractive for
theoretical study, since they possess many essential fea-
tures in common with real water waves, and simultane-
ously are relatively simple for analytical and numerical
treatment. A powerful mathematical support for the 2D
theory is provided by analytical functions and the corre-
sponding conformal mappings. The original idea of us-
ing conformal mappings was intended for waves on the
deep water or over a static horizontal bottom: a ge-
ometrically simple region occupied by resting ﬂuid (it
is the lower half-plane [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15], or a
horizontal stripe [12]) is mapped onto the ﬂow region
with a disturbed time-dependent free surface, so that
the real axis is transformed into the moving boundary.
With such conformal “straightening” of the free bound-
ary, it is possible to obtain an exact analytical description
for surface waves. The corresponding (1+1)-dimensional
nonlinear equations of motion are very convenient for
numerical simulations by spectral methods.
Important
achievements in this direction were reported in works
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], including analytical and numer-
ical results. A generalization has been recently made to
the case when the bottom shape is still static but strongly
inhomogeneous in space [16].

The purpose of present paper is to derive exact equa-
tions of motion for the free boundary in 2D ideal ﬂows,
valid with arbitrary non-stationary bottom proﬁle, and
to suggest a numerical method for solving the obtained
highly nonlinear equations. This problem, besides being
interesting by itself, is also important for studying such
phenomena as tsunami generation by earthquakes and
other similar processes in natural and laboratory condi-
tions.

Let us start our consideration with basic deﬁnitions.
We will describe a nonstationary ﬂow region
z in (x, y)-
plane (with y-axis up-directed) by an analytical function
x + iy = z(w, t), where t is the time, and the complex
variable w = u + iv occupies in (u, v)-plane the ﬁxed

z will be determined by

Z (b)(u, t) = z(u, t).

(2)

≡

Inasmuch as the velocity potential ϕ(x, y, t) satisﬁes the
Laplace equation ϕxx + ϕyy = 0, in
z the analytical
complex potential ˜φ(z, t) = ϕ(x, y, t) + iθ(x, y, t) is de-
ﬁned, with θ(x, y) being the harmonically conjugate for
ϕ(x, y). We deal below with the complex analytical func-
tion φ(w, t) = ˜φ(z(w, t), t) deﬁned in
w and taking the
boundary values as written below:

Two other equations of motion are the kinematic con-
ditions on the free surface and on the bottom, expressing
the fact that the boundary motion is determined by the
normal component of the velocity ﬁeld. In the conformal
variables these conditions take form

We should take into account that Φ(s)(u, t) and
Φ(b)(u, t) are not mutually independent, but they are re-
lated to each other by a linear transform. Indeed, the
following formula for analytical continuation is valid:

φ(w, t) =

Here the Fourier transform Φ(b)(u)

is deﬁned in

Φ(b)

k (t) =

Therefore at the free surface, where w = u + i, we have

Φ(s)(u, t) =

(11)

It is a proper point here to introduce some linear op-
erators, necessary for further exposition. These linear
operators ˆS, ˆR, and ˆT = ˆR−1 are diagonal in Fourier
representation:

Sk = 1/cosh(k), Rk = i tanh(k),

Tk =

i coth(k).

(12)
It will be convenient for us to write Φ(b)(u, t) in the form

Φ(b)(u, t) = ˆSψ(u, t)

(13)

with ψ(u, t) and f (u, t) being some unknown real func-

Φ(s)(u, t) = (1 + i ˆR)ψ(u, t)

i ˆS ˆ∂

Later we use in equations the complex function

Ψ(u, t)

(1 + i ˆR)ψ(u, t).

(15)

Now it is necessary to look at the conformal mapping
z(w, t) with more attention. Since the bottom motion is
assumed to be prescribed, this function has the following
structure (compare with [16]):

z(w, t) = Z(ζ(w, t), t),

(16)

where a known analytical function Z(ζ, t) determines a
conformal mapping for the upper half-plane of an in-
termediate complex variable ζ onto the inﬁnite region

2

above the bottom in z-plane (or, at least, the mapping
Z(ζ, t) should have no singularities within a suﬃciently
wide horizontal stripe above the real axis in ζ-plane, so
there should be enough “free space” for large-amplitude
waves in z-plane). The intermediate analytical function
ζ(w, t) takes real values at the real axis. Therefore we
may write

ζ(w, t) =

Z

ak(t)
cosh(k)

eikw dk
2π

,

a−k = ¯ak

(17)

where ak(t) is the Fourier transform of a real function
a(u, t). On the bottom ζ(u, t) = ˆSa(u, t), thus the para-
metrically given curve

Z (b)(u, t) = Z( ˆSa(u, t), t),

coincides with the prescribed curve X + iY =

ξ(u, t) = (1 + i ˆR)a(u, t),

≡

Z (s)(u, t) = Z(ξ(u, t), t).

(19)

(20)

Since our purpose is to derive equations of motion for
the unknown functions Ψ(u, t), f (u, t), and ξ(u, t), we
have to substitute expressions (13), (14), (18), (19), and
(20) into Eqs.(6), (7), (8). Eq.(8) is simple and does not

This system of equations is the main result of present
paper. It provides exact description for potential water
waves over a time-dependent bottom determined by an
analytical function Z(ζ, t). It should be noted that cap-
illarity eﬀects can be easily included here by adding the

3. Numerical method

Equations (22), (23), (24), though look quite compli-
cated, are convenient for numerical simulations, as de-
scribed below.

Instead of the function Ψ(u, t), we deal with another

function (similar to that proposed in [14, 15]),

β(u, t) = Ψu(u, t)/ξu(u, t),

(25)

because this choice results in better numerical stability
(concerning the problem of optimal variables see [17, 18]).
Let us consider x-periodic proﬁles of the bottom. With
a proper choice for the length and time scales, we may
write g = 1, and Z(ζ + 2π, t) = 2π + Z(ζ, t). As it
was pointed in [16], in space-periodic ﬂows the variable u
comes into solutions in the combination ϑ = uα(t), with
a real function α(t) depending on time because the oper-
ator ˆT is singular on small wave-numbers. Besides α(t),
solutions are determined by two real functions, ρ(ϑ, t)
and χ(ϑ, t), both having period 2π on ϑ variable:

ρ(ϑ, t) =

ρm(t) exp(imϑ),

ρ−m(t) = ¯ρm(t),(26)

χm(t) exp(imϑ), χ−m(t) = ¯χm(t),(27)

The above system (34)-(36) can be eﬃciently simulated
by the spectral method, since the multiplications are sim-
ple in ϑ-representation, while the linear operators ˆSα, ˆRα,
and ˆTα (also ϑ-diﬀerentiation) are simple in Fourier rep-
resentation. The integration scheme can be based, for in-
stance, on the Runge-Kutta 4-th order accuracy method,
similarly to works [15, 16]. Eﬃcient subroutine libraries
for the fast Fourier transform are now available. In the
numerical experiment reported here, the FFTW library
was used [19]. The employed Fourier harmonics had num-
8000 < m < 8000, so the obtained
bers m in the limits
solutions are very accurate (compare with [16]). The

presented in Figs.1-4 in terms of the dimensionless quan-
tities z = x + iy and V = β/Zξ(ξ, t) = Vx

numerical experiment can be viewed as a rough model
for a tsunami wave generation, subsequent propagation,
and ﬁnal breaking. Indeed, the inhomogeneous bottom
displacement is an analog of an earthquake resulting in
two opposite-propagating groups of surface waves. When
one of the groups ﬁrst approaches a shallow region, the
crest of its leading wave becomes higher and sharper, and
ﬁnally singular. In real world instead true singularity one
can observe vortices, splash, and foam on the crest. Fur-

Abstract

A number of simpliﬁed dynamical problems is studied in an at-
tempt to clarify some of the mechanisms leading to turbulence and
the existing proposals to control this transition.

A simpliﬁed set of boundary layer equations displays a solution
that corresponds to the rolls and streaks instability and exhibits its
streamwise localized nature. The eﬀect of random phases as a device
to control the transfer of energy to the small scales is studied both
for the shell and the boundary layer models. In spite of the simpliﬁed
nature of the models, they also provide some insight on the prospects
for active turbulence control by external body forces.

1 Introduction

A realistic model for the transition to turbulence and for the mechanisms
of turbulent energy dissipation, requires not only an accurate control of the
ﬂuid equations but also a consideration of the eﬀect of diﬀerent boundary
conditions and of the external forces. Nevertheless, as in other ﬁelds of
physics, a step towards the understanding and control of the phenomena
is the identiﬁcation of the universal mechanisms which are always present,
independently of the particular system or the boundary conditions. One such

1

mechanism is associated to the role of coherent structures in the generation
of turbulent energy.

Flow visualization techniques[1] [2] [3], as well as two-point correlation
measurements[4], have revealed that a large amount of the near wall turbulent
energy is associated to coherent structures (streamwise rolls and streaks) and
to their breakdown (bursts). Of particular importance for the shear stress
peaks at the wall, that are associated to the bursting events, is the trans-
fer of fast moving ﬂuid to the near wall region (sweeps) and the transfer of
energy to small turbulence scales at a rate faster than the normal Kolmogo-
roﬀ cascade. Understanding and modeling these phenomena is of practical
importance because, stabilizing or delaying the evolution of the coherent
structures, might decrease the energy dissipation rate. For this purpose, in
Sect. 2, a set of simpliﬁed boundary layer equations is developed, which
provides a good degree of analytical control over the coherent structure so-
lutions. From the approximate equations and their solutions, the generation
and lifting eﬀect of the rolls-plus-streaks instability is clearly understood as
well as its streamwise localized nature.

Another mechanism of critical importance, in the development of tur-
bulence, is the transfer of energy from the large to the small scales. The
rate of transfer may be also be aﬀected by the time scale of destabilization
of the coherent structures. The transfer of energy between diﬀerent length
scales is favored by the establishment of precise phase relations between the
dynamical evolution of the intervening scales. This led several authors[5] [6]
to suggest that randomizing the phases might have a strong eﬀect either on
blocking the cascade of energy transfer or on destabilizing some structures.
In Sect.3 the eﬀect of random phases is studied, ﬁrst in the shell model and
then in the boundary layer equations. The study of these two cases puts
into evidence the reasons and conditions for eﬀectiveness of random phase
control techniques. In the shell model, phase randomization of almost any
mode, has an eﬀective blocking eﬀect on the energy transfer to the small
scales. However, in the boundary layer equations, the eﬀect is not so striking
and is only observed if the phases that are randomized are those of some
particular modes. The reason for this diﬀerent behavior is the local (in mo-
mentum space) nature of the interactions in the shell model as opposed to
the long-range mode interactions in the boundary layer equations. The con-
clusion is that for boundary layer turbulence control, phase randomization is
eﬀective only if a ﬁne tuning of the phase-randomized modes is done. When
the phase randomization is implemented by boundary conditions (artiﬁcial

2

roughness, for example) the need for a ﬁne tuning of the randomized modes
may hinder the applicability of the method.

Finally, in Sect.4, the prospects for active control of the coherent struc-
tures by external body forces is considered. Here again, the fact that simpli-
ﬁed boundary layer equations are used, provides a clear view of the relevant
dynamical mechanisms. Feasible control signals are derivatives at the wall
and external forces cannot be designed with complex wall-normal dependen-
cies. Taking these two facts into account the conclusion is that control by
external body forces has almost no eﬀect on the development, growth and
break-up of the coherent structures. Therefore the turbulence production
rate is not signiﬁcantly changed. However, by controlling a small layer of
non-active ﬂuid near the wall, a reduction in skin friction drag might be
obtained.

2 Wall region coherent structures from the

boundary layer equations

Numerical simulations[7] and a detailed analysis of the ﬂow equations[8] have
uncovered a possible self-sustained mechanism for the coherent structures in
the wall region. Let x, y and z be the streamwise, the wall normal and
the spanwise coordinates. The process starts from counter-rotating stream-
wise rolls which would decouple from the streamwise velocity component if
the ﬂow were independent of x. However the rolls redistribute the momen-
tum, creating ﬂuctuations in the streamwise velocity (streaks). The spanwise
inﬂections create an instability of the streaks and this in turn leads to a non-
linear energizing of the original streamwise rolls.
It is probable that this
self-sustaining scheme, discussed by Waleﬀe[8] for a sinusoidal wall-bounded
shear ﬂow, captures the correct physical process. However, because of its
fragmented mathematical description, it is diﬃcult to use it as a basis for
quantitative predictions and, for example, for the evaluation of eﬀective con-
trol mechanisms. It would be better to obtain a single solution of the ﬂow
equations comprising all the eﬀects (rolls, streaks and instability growth). For
the full Navier-Stokes equations such solution does not seem easy to obtain.
However, for the simpliﬁed boundary layer equations, the problem is not so
hard and the mechanism may be made more explicit. In particular it will
be seen why it is essential to take the x−dependence into account from the

ready suggests a rate of growth increasing with the local streamwise velocity.

This behavior of the obtained solution matches the experimental fact that
unstable streaks lift away from the wall.

The solution, just studied, is suﬃciently simple and well under control to
serve as a basis for the study of control methods. In the following section
the eﬀect of random phases in this and other models is discussed and Sect.4
reports on the perspectives for active control by external forces.

3 Random phases and energy transfer in the

turbulence cascade

Turbulence generation implies a transfer of energy between structures at dif-
ferent length scales. Any mechanism that interferes with this energy transfer
may have a controlling eﬀect on the rate of turbulence production. A mech-
anism of this kind was put in evidence in Ref.[5]. Using a spectral code for
a direct numerical simulation of a turbulent ﬂow, it was found that random-
ization of the phases of some of the Fourier modes have a strong eﬀect on
turbulence and leads to drag reduction. Drag reduction was also obtained
on a recent experiment[6] of ﬂow over a surface with a random arrangement
of protrusions. These eﬀects have been interpreted as originating from the
destruction by the phase randomization of the coherence of the large-scale
turbulence producing structures. Interfering with the formation of rolls and
plane waves, random phases (or random roughness) would delay turbulence
production and bursting.

Another important eﬀect that is associated to phase randomization is the
blocking of energy transfer to the small scales of turbulence. This is the
phenomenon that will be analyzed in this section, ﬁrst in the context of the
shell model and then for the boundary layer equations.

3.1 Random phases in the shell model

The shell model is a toy model for the turbulence cascade. It may not be
directly relevant for the turbulence generating phenomena in the boundary
layer, nevertheless its study provides a good insight on the mechanisms of
energy transfer between length scales. Let un be the Fourier modes of a
velocity ﬁeld. Then, the Gledzer-Yamada-Ohkitani[10] [11] shell model is
deﬁned by the equation

The system is driven at mode 4 and the other modes are energized by
a cascade of energy transfer. The simulations start from a point in the

in the inertial region.

Now, starting from a point in the attractor one lets the system evolve for
a time ∆t = 130 but, at each step, the phase of one or several of the modes is
randomized. The results are shown in Figs.5a-c. For Fig.5a diﬀerent random
phases are given to the modes 10, 11 and 12. For Fig.5b only the phase of
mode 11 is randomized. For Fig.5c the same random phase is given to the
modes 10, 11 and 12. In all cases one observes a strong blocking eﬀect in the
energy ﬂow to the small scales, stronger when several phases are randomized
but also quite large when only the phase of mode 11 is randomized. By

9

contrast if, instead of random phases, one applies a small random excitation
to an intermediate mode almost no eﬀect is observed.

In this model the blocking of energy transfer by random phases has a

simple interpretation. The energy ﬂow through mode M is

If uM is multiplied by a random phase

and there is no energy ﬂow through mode M. One also sees, from Eq.(19),
that the possibility of blocking the energy transfer to the small scales depends
critically on the local nature of the energy ﬂow. Namely, the fact that only a
few neighboring modes are involved in the energy transfer. That means that
any random phase, on any mode whatsoever, will have a blocking eﬀect. As
it will be seen later, the situation in the boundary layer equations is quite
diﬀerent.

3.2 Random phases in the boundary layer equations

For the boundary layer case one evolves Eqs.(13), starting from the same
initial conditions and for the same number of time steps as in Sect.2. Fig.6
shows the result when the phase of the v1 component is randomized at each
step. In this case one obtains a sizable suppression of the energy transfer to
the higher modes. However, for the simulation parameters that were used
(γ = 5, k = 2), randomizing the phase of mode 1 is the only case where any
appreciable eﬀect is observed. Randomizing the phases of the higher modes
does not seem to block the energy transfer.

This phenomenon may be understood from the Eqs.(13). First, and unlike
the shell model, the nature of the transfer function g(n
, n) implies that there
are long-range eﬀects, each mode receiving contributions from all the others.

′

10

On the other hand one sees from the diagonal terms in Eqs.(13) that, for
each set of parameters, there is a number of intrinsically growing modes up
to some nmax , with the other modes receiving energy from these unstable
, n). It so happens that, for the simulation
modes by the transfer function g(n
parameters that were used, mode 1 is the unstable mode and only if one acts
on this mode does one obtain some eﬀect.

′

In view of these two phenomena (the long-range interaction and the stable
versus unstable mode eﬀect) the method of random phases will be eﬀective,
in the control of the structures, only if it is carefully designed to act on all
the unstable modes. It must be designed in a case-by-case basis and might
become ineﬀective when the kinematical parameters change.

4 Active control. Prospects

′

Here one analyses the eﬀect of external forces (the F
in Eq.(5)) on the
growth and eventual stabilization of the coherent structures in the boundary
layer equations. The aim is to ﬁnd out whether an active control scheme
may be developed using this type of forces.
If eﬀective control is to be
achieved, it is the dominant dynamical eﬀects that have to be addressed.
Therefore it makes sense to use a setting as simple as possible to be able to
isolate and interpret the most basic eﬀects. In particular, one may assume
that outside the boundary layer region there is a uniform constant pressure
without ﬂuctuations. Then, if F
y = 0, the second equation in (4) implies
∂p
∂y = 0 and therefore, from uniformity, also ∂p
∂z = 0. In this case the
pressure terms may be dropped.

∂x = ∂p

′

Using now the information obtained in Sect.2, namely the fact that grow-

ing coherent structures must be localized in the x−variable, one writes

and the linearized ﬂuctuation equations become

As before, consider an exponential proﬁle for the steady-state ﬂow

u(y) = ue

1 − e−αy
(cid:0)
Eqs.(21) are simple enough to even allow explicit analytical solutions. For
example the second equation in (21) reduces after a change of variable to the
modiﬁed Bessel equation. However, better insight is obtained by displaying
its numerical solution, starting from diﬀerent sets of initial conditions. For
example, starting from an initial condition U(y, t) ∼ sin(2πy), V (y, t) ∼
(cos(2πy) − 1) and W ∼ sin(2πy) (Fig.7a), as in Sect.2, one ﬁnds once more
that time evolution lifts this structure away from the wall (Fig.7b).

(cid:1)

′

To control this structure would mean to damp it or at least to avoid its
instability, growth and lifting away from the wall. Instability of the structure
generates small scale turbulence. On the other hand when the structure lifts
away from the wall one sees a clear growth of the V −component which is
the mathematical equivalent of an ejection or a sweep. This exchange of
boundary layer ﬂuid with the external fast moving ﬂuid increases the skin
friction drag.

′

Mathematically it would be very simple to invent forcing terms F

x and
F
z which stabilize or damp the structures. For example, forces proportional
to the second derivative ∂2
∂y2 would be equivalent to a change of the viscosity
coeﬃcient . However it is not realistic to assume that forces with the appro-
priate y−dependence may be obtained, nor it is in general possible to detect
the corresponding y−variation of the ﬂuctuating ﬂow components. At most
one may apply a force that is essentially constant throughout the boundary
layer and the signal to be detected might be the value of the derivative at
y = 0 of the velocity ﬂuctuations. In Fig.7c the result of a control experi-
ment of this type is displayed. At each time step the derivatives ∂U
∂y |y=0 and
∂W
∂y |y=0 are detected and a force is applied to the ﬂuid near the wall that is
proportional to the diﬀerence between this derivative and the corresponding
derivative of the initial condition. That is, the control tends to preserve the
derivative at the wall. The range of the force that is applied is the same
as the range of the boundary condition (a unit interval). One sees that the
control maintains the circulation in the wall region but does not avoid the
lifting of the structure. Actually a linear control, as used, has an overshoot-
ing eﬀect because, as the structure lifts away from the wall, the derivative
naturally decreases and the control, that at ﬁrst counters the sweep in the
V −component, later causes an ejection.

12

Instead of trying to stabilize a formed roll-streak structure one might in-
stead apply a force to kill the derivatives at the wall. In Figs.8a,b one shows
the results of such an experiment. Starting from a small random non-zero
initial condition in the interval y ∈ [0, 1] , a lifted structure develops (Fig.8a)
which is qualitatively similar to those obtained from roll-streak initial con-
ditions. Applying a controlling force proportional to the derivatives at y = 0
, one obtains the result shown in Fig.8b. One sees that away from the wall
the lifted structure is similar in the controlled and non-controlled cases. The
diﬀerence is the vanishing of the derivatives at the wall in the controlled
case. The conclusion is that, with detection of the wall derivatives and an
applied force in the boundary layer region, the eﬀect over the development,
growth and eventual break-up of the coherent structures is minimal. The
only non-negligible eﬀect that can be achieved is that, by suppressing the
wall derivatives, all this activity is kept away from a small near-wall region.
In practical terms, the conclusion is that not much eﬀect is be expected in the
turbulence production rate. However, by keeping a non-active small layer at
the wall, a reduction in the skin friction drag might be obtained. The eﬀect
is similar to one of the interpretations of a riblet structure, namely that of
keeping a region of non-active ﬂuid inside the grooves. The diﬀerence is that
here no penalty would be paid for an increased contact surface.

5 Conclusions

Isolating the dominating terms in the near-wall ﬂow equations, some un-
derstanding of the turbulence-generating structures is obtained. Also, the
simpliﬁed equations make a clear distinction between what is important and
what it is not, for the ﬂow control action.

Phase randomness (introduced by surface eﬀects, for example) which may
be very striking in particular models and for some kinematical regions, seems
to lack general validity and to require ﬁne tuning of the phases that are to
be randomized.

Active control by external body forces, reacting to the measurement of
the surface derivatives, have only a limited eﬀect on the development, growth
and break-up of the coherent structures. Therefore the turbulence production
rate is not signiﬁcantly changed. However, by controlling a small layer of
non-active ﬂuid near the wall, a reduction in the skin friction drag may be
obtained.

13

The type of externally controlled body forces that have been proposed
in the past[9] [13] may be obtained by injecting ionized ﬂuid (the same or
another easier to ionize ﬂuid) in the boundary layer and acting on it by
electromagnetic forces. In this setting, static ﬁelds already have an eﬀect on
the ﬂow proﬁle[9]. However to act on the turbulence-generating structures
active control is required. Special attention has to be paid to the fact that,
although the control acts on the bulk of the boundary layer, the detection of
the signals is only realistic at the wall. Surface stress being directly related
to wall-normal velocity derivatives, this seems to be the most appropriate
parameter on which to base active control. Detection of ﬁeld ﬂuctuations,
in an ionized ﬂuid, would be an interesting possibility, but it seems a more
remote possibility from a practical point of view.

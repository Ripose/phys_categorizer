Numerical calculations of 4He − II hydrodynamics show that a dense tangle of superﬂuid vortices
induces in an initially stationary normal ﬂuid a highly dissipative, complex, vortical ﬂow pattern
(”turbulence”) with k−2.2
energy spectrum scaling and ﬂuctuations Reynolds number of order unity.
In this normal ﬂuid ﬂow the eﬀects of mutual friction excitation from the superﬂuid vortices and
those of viscous stresses are of the same order. The results suggest that in previous experiments
the dynamics of decaying, high Reynolds number, quantum turbulent ﬂows could only weakly be
aﬀected by the quantized vortices. As a consequence, their energy spectra would be (to a very good
approximation) the classical, Navier-Stokes type, energy spectra of the normal ﬂuid component.

In quantum ﬂuid turbulence [1], a tangle of quantized
vortices interacts via mutual friction forces with thermal
excitations (known as normal ﬂuid) of the superﬂuid
ground state. Until recently, theoretical investigations
involved only the dynamics of the superﬂuid vortices [2].
The normal ﬂuid ﬂow was assumed to possess inﬁnite
inertia and it was prescribed in a kinematic way. Nu-
merical and computational methods for fully dynamical
quantized turbulence calculations were developed for the
ﬁrst time in [3]. Subsequently, the strategy of gradually
increasing complexity was adopted in performing a series
of three dimensional calculations. First, it was shown in
[4] that a superﬂuid vortex ring induces in an initially
stationary normal ﬂuid two coaxial vortices which
together with the quantized ring propagate as a triple
ring structure. A second calculation [5] allowed a small
number of reconnections in order to show that Kelvin
waves excited by the latter induced a dramatic increase
of kinetic energy dissipation rate in the normal ﬂuid.
The present Letter introduces the element of vortex line
density characteristic of experiments while keeping the
condition of initial stationarity for the normal ﬂuid.

The numerical method is described in detail in the
mentioned references. If S(ξ, t) is the three dimensional
representation of the vortex tangle (where ξ is the ar-
clength parametrization along the loops), then its motion
obeys the equation [6]:

dS

tangent vector while h, h× and h×× are constants related
to mutual friction physics. In writing equation (1) one
ignores the inertia of the vortices and the spectral-ﬂow
(Kopnin) force that is relevant only for fermionic quan-
tum ﬂuids. The equation includes the Magnus, drag and
Iordanskii forces [6]. We call the sum of the Iordanskii
and drag forces mutual friction. In the deﬁnition of Vs
any irrotational ground state motion has been neglected.
The motion of the normal ﬂuid is governed by the forced
incompressible Navier-Stokes equation:

where ρn is the density of the normal ﬂuid, ρ is the total
density of the ﬂuid, p is the pressure, ν = µ
ρn is the
kinematic viscosity (µ stands for the dynamic viscosity)
and F is the mutual friction force per unit volume. The
latter is being calculated from the formula for the sum of
the drag and Iordanskii forces per unit vortex length f :

f = ρsκd××S′ × (S′ × (Vn − Vl)) −

ρsκd×S′ × (Vn − Vl).

(5)

where ρs is the density of the super ﬂuid and the dimen-
sionless term d× incorporates both the Iordanskii and
the corresponding drag force component coeﬃcients. The
numerical procedure for obtaining F from f detects ﬁrst
all segments of the vortex tangle inside a numerical grid
cell. Then, it numerically integrates the known f over
the length of these segments and divides with the cell
volume. Grid cells that contain no vortices have zero
mutual friction force.
The working ﬂuid is 4He − II and so the quantum of cir-
culation has the value κ = 9.97·10−4cm2/s. The calcula-
tion is done at T = 1.3K for which the other parameters
of the problem have the values: ν = 23.30 · 10−4cm2/s

(left); histogram h(c) of curvature of superﬂuid vortices at normal ﬂuid kinetic energy peak (right).

ρs = 138.6 · 10−3g/cm−3 (with ρs
ρn = 21.323), h = 0.978,
h× = 4.0937·10−2, h×× = 2.175·10−2, d× = −2.045·10−2
and d×× = 4.270 · 10−2.

We employ periodic boundary conditions. Both ﬂuids
are advanced with the same timestep. Provision has been
taken so that the latter resolves adequately the fastest
Kelvin waves present in the tangle. This requirement
leads to rather constricted time steps, ∆t = 0.483·10−3s,
which are of the order of the viscous time scale in the
normal ﬂuid. The grid size for the Navier-Stokes calcu-
lation is 643. In this way the width of a numerical cell is
∆x = lb/64 = 1.56 · 10−3cm and this length is used also
for discretizing the vortex loops. Here, lb = 0.1cm is the
size of the system. Initially there are 351 randomly ori-
ented vortex rings with radii between 0.34lb and 0.45lb
(and therefore with curvatures c between 20cm−1 and
30cm−1). The initial tangle length is L = 77.9cm and
N = 99527 vortex points are used for its discretization.

At the same time, the vortex line density is Λ = L/l3
b =
0.779 · 105cm−2 and the average intervortex spacing is
δ ≈ Λ−1/2 = 0.0036cm which corresponds to wavenum-
ber kδ ≈ 277cm−1. Our vortex line density is representa-
tive of experimental conditions. For example, the value
reported in ﬁg.2 of [7] for grid velocity vg = 5cm/s and
T = 1.5K was Λ ≈ 2 · 105cm−2. Our vortex line density
is larger than the value of Λ ≈ 0.18 · 105cm−2 (again for
vg = 5cm/s and T = 1.5K), reported in the same ex-
periment at saturation when the observed classical decay
begins.

The results of Fig.1 show that (due to excitation from
mutual friction force) energy is being transfered from
the superﬂuid to the normal ﬂuid with simultaneous
decrease in vortex tangle length. The latter does not
occur in a monotonous fashion.
In particular, around
t = 0.03s a local enstrophy maximum (consistently
associated with a reduction in the slope of normal
kinetic energy growth) is accompanied by rapid vortex
length growth. This phenomenon could be explained by
noticing that the initial vortex conﬁguration is not the
natural state of the system. There must be a transient
length increase having to do with the induction and
evolution of (reconnection triggered) Kelvin waves along
the vortices.
Indeed since the time step resolves the
fastest Kelvin waves and until t = 0.03s approximately
150 time steps were taken, adequate time was available
for vortex wave growth.
In this milieu, the previously
mentioned enstrophy peak could be a manifestation of
the established [5] intensiﬁcation of dissipation rate in
the normal ﬂuid due to reconnection associated Kelvin
waves. The plausibility of this explanation was further
supported by observing the actual conﬁguration of the
tangle. Overall, the recorded tangle length growth is
a systemic transient towards a generic vortex conﬁgu-

sustains a linear growth of constant slope (Fig.1). More-
over, although there are initially 351 loops in the system,
at the end of the transient there are approximately 10,
a number that remains constant afterwards with 2 − 3
loops having more than 90% of the tangle length.
The computation also shows that (at t ≈ 0.097s)
there is a critical tangle length Lc = 74.55cm and an
associated fractal dimension (measured with the box
counting algorithm [8]) Dc = 1.87 for which the normal
ﬂuid energy attains a peak. The fractal scaling was
observed over almost two decades from the system size
(lb = 0.1cm) to the discretization length along the
vortices (∆x = 1.5 · 10−3). This could mean that as
the length decreases and the normal ﬂuid volume not
in the vicinity of a quantized vortex increases, regions
appear in the normal ﬂuid where the viscous action is
not counteracted by mutual friction excitation. In these
regions energy can only be dissipated into heat. Notice
that at this time 86% of the tangle’s length belonged to
a single loop. The latter loop was also found to be a
fractal with dimension Dgl = 1.84.
Helicity keeps oscillating around zero. Since helicity is
identically zero for two dimensional vortical ﬂow, this
diagnostic might be an indication of a tendency of the
normal ﬂuid ﬂow to occur (locally) on planes normal to
the superﬂuid vortices and the normal ﬂow vorticity (see
[4] for a demonstration of this).
The velocity spectrum at normal kinetic energy peak

is found in Fig.2 to scale like En(k) ∝ k−2.2. The
end of the energy spectrum coincides with the average
intervortex spacing wavenumber (for the same time)
kδ ≈ 273cm−1. Comparing with En(k) ∝ k−5/3 of
inertial turbulence, we comment that the present ﬂow
does not comply with the familiar classical turbulence
concept of energy injection at large scales and its
subsequent transfer by nonlinear terms towards smaller
scales through a local in spectral space cascade. Instead,
normal ﬂuid motion is being simultaneously excited and
dissipated at all resolved ﬂow scales by mutual friction
and viscous forces respectively. The curvature histogram
h(c) in Fig.2 (again at energy peak) which indicates that
reconnections exite in the initial tangle curvature scales
much ﬁner than the resolved velocity scales supports this
argument. The acquired energy would tend to remain
localized in the respective wavenumber space regime
where it ﬁrst appeared. This is because energy ﬂuxes
in wavenumber space are nonlinear eﬀects [9] and the
present nonlinearity in the normal ﬂow is weak (since if
it was strong we should have seen the formation of an
inertial range with high Re number in the normal ﬂuid).
It is important not to confuse the present turbulence
with the dissipation regime of classical turbulence.
Although viscous eﬀects are strong and the spectrum
slope is steep, at the same time the system is forced at
all resolvable scales and we do not have an exponential
In fact, the recorded −2.2 scaling exponent is

less steep than the −3 energy scaling exponent of the
direct inertial enstrophy cascade in two dimensional
turbulence [10].
Incidentally, the energy ﬂux in the
direct enstrophy cascade of the latter case is also zero
[10] holding a resemblance to the present case.
From a somewhat diﬀerent perspective, one notes that
in the computation of [4] involving the propagation of
a single superﬂuid ring, the circulation strength κn of
the induced normal vortices was found to be of order
κ. For 4He − II κ is of the order of ν. For example,
at T = 2.171 when ρs
ν = 5.47 which
is an indicative upper limit for this parameter. For
comparison, in classical ﬂuids κn
could easily acquire
ν
values of the order 106. Because of these, the induced
normal ﬂow in [4] was a highly dissipative ﬂow. The
present results suggest that the above physical picture is
not aﬀected by the much higher vortex line density. It
is obvious that vortex tangles much denser than those
found in [7] are required in order to achieve induced
normal ﬂow Reynolds numbers similar to those found in
classical ﬂuid dynamics.

ρn = 0.0467 it is κ

Overall, the present data lead to a number of conclu-
sions about high Reynolds number quantum turbulence.
First, one can conclude that in fully developed 4He − II
turbulence the normal ﬂuid inertia is due to imposed
pressure gradients and external stirring (e.g. by towing a
grid) rather than to excitation from superﬂuid vortices.

Deﬁnitely, the present calculation does not exclude the
possibility that at high Re number the normal ﬂow
might introduce a kind of organization in the vortex
tangle, for example bundles of aligned quantized vortices
functioning like classical ones at large enough scales.
Then, the superﬂuid vortex tangle could in turn stir
vigorously the normal ﬂuid (at these large scales). How-
ever, even if something like this does happen, it ought
to bridge the gap between the normal ﬂuid Re number
of order 1 of the present calculation and the normal
ﬂuid Re numbers 103 < Re < 2 · 105 of the experiment
of [7] (with analogous to ours vortex line density and
temperature) or Re = 1.4 · 105 in the experiment of [11].
By the same token, the assumption of [7] that the two
ﬂuids have comparable vorticities seems unlikely.
Second, there are cases where the action of the mutual
friction force could cause an initially laminar normal
ﬂow to become unstable and subsequently turbulent
[12]. This computation suggests that the ensuing normal
ﬂuid turbulence would still be maintained by interaction
of the normal ﬂuid Reynolds stresses with normal ﬂuid
mean velocity gradients induced by the instability [13]
and not by (the meager) direct energy input from the
superﬂuid vortices.
Third, (and in agreement with the discussion of [14]), in
high Re number quantum ﬂows of previous experiments
[7, 11] the observed energy spectra should have been to
a very good approximation the unforced Navier-Stokes
spectra of the normal ﬂuid. This conclusion could be
reached as follows: (a) in the [7] experiment, the normal
ﬂuid spectrum is the dominant one. To prove this,
we ﬁrst notice that the superﬂuid kinetic energy in
the latter experiment should have been of the order of
magnitude of the present one since the peak vortex line
densities are close. In the present calculation however,
the superﬂuid energy is of the order of magnitude of
the normal ﬂuid energy since the latter is due entirely
to the presence of the quantized vortices. By (safely)
extrapolating from the current data, we conclude that
even if all initial tangle length was instantly transformed
to normal ﬂuid energy, we could not match normal
turbulent Reynolds numbers of order 104 typical of
experiments. Hence, statement (a) follows.
In order
for the dominant normal ﬂuid spectrum to be also of
the unforced Navier-Stokes type, it must be true that:
(b) the magnitude of the mutual friction force is much
smaller than the magnitude of the normal ﬂuid inertial
terms. This appears to be the case in [7] since if the mu-
tual friction force was comparable to the inertial terms
one would have observed a vigorous energy transfer from
the normal ﬂuid to the superﬂuid.
In stating this, we
take into account that according to proposition (a) the
normal ﬂuid energy exceeds signiﬁcantly the superﬂuid
energy. This energy transfer would have resulted in an
equally vigorous (by orders of magnitude) growth of the
vortex tangle length. Yet, the results of [7] show that

4

exactly the opposite happens (the length decreases).
Therefore, in the experiment of [7] mutual friction eﬀects
do not scale with inertial normal ﬂuid eﬀects and the
quantum ﬂuid spectrum would be approximately that of
the unforced Navier-Stokes dynamics of the normal ﬂow.

The above conclusions could have been modiﬁed in
case the turbulence in [7] was not decaying. A key vari-
able is vortex line density and the latter might not attain
in [7] high values because the normal ﬂuid ﬂuctuations
(responsible for its growth at the initial rapid transient in
the experiment) decay fast. In case a stationary normal
ﬂuid turbulence could be established via a sort of forcing,
it would be possible for the vortex tangle to reach a kind
of equilibrium with the normal turbulence characterized
by a vortex line density corresponding to superﬂuid ener-
gies comparable to those of the normal ﬂuid. Notice that
simply increasing the turbulence Reynolds number in [7]
might not have the latter eﬀect since in this case the in-
crease in superﬂuid energy (denser tangle) would come
together with high values of normal ﬂuid turbulence and
the imbalance between the two could be preserved. The
associated complexity of such quantum ﬂows makes un-
likely their calculation before the satisfactory resolution
of a number of computational issues.

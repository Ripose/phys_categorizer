Universal dynamics in the onset of a
Hagen–Poiseuille ﬂow

(Received November 7, 2005)

The dynamics in the onset of a Hagen–Poiseuille ﬂow of an incompressible liquid in a
channel of circular cross section is well-studied theoretically. We use an eigenfunction
expansion in a Hilbert space formalism to generalize the results to channels of arbitrary
cross section. We ﬁnd that the steady state is reached after a characteristic time scale
τ = (A/P)2(1/ν) where A and P are the cross-sectional area and perimeter, respectively,
and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid. For the initial dynamics of the ﬂow rate
Q for t ≪ τ we ﬁnd a universal linear dependence, Q(t) = Q∞ (α/C) (t/τ ), where
Q∞ is the asymptotic steady-state ﬂow rate, α is the geometrical correction factor, and
C = P 2/A is the compactness parameter. For the long-time dynamics Q(t) approaches
Q∞ exponentially on the timescale τ , but with a weakly geometry-dependent prefactor
of order unity, determined by the lowest eigenvalue of the Helmholz equation.

1. Introduction

Hagen–Poiseuille ﬂow (or simply Poiseuille ﬂow) is important to a variety of applica-
tions ranging from macroscopic pipes in chemical plants to the ﬂow of blood in veins. How-
ever, the rapid development in the ﬁeld of lab-on-a-chip systems during the past decade
has put even more emphasis on pressure driven laminar ﬂow. Traditionally, capillary
tubes would have circular cross-sections, but today microfabricated channels come with
a variety of shapes depending on the fabrication technique in use. The list of examples
includes rectangular channels obtained by hot embossing in polymer wafers, semi-circular
channels in isotropically etched surfaces, triangular channels in KOH-etched silicon crys-
tals, Gaussian-shaped channels in laser-ablated polymer ﬁlms, and elliptic channels in
stretched PDMS devices, see e.g. Geschke et al. (2004).

This development has naturally led to more emphasis on theoretical studies of shape-
dependence in microﬂuidic channels. Recently, we therefore revisited the problem of
Poiseuille ﬂow and its shape dependence and we have also addressed mass diﬀusion
in microchannels, Mortensen et al. (2005a,b). In the present work we combine the two
former studies and address the dynamics caused by the abrupt onset of a pressure gradient
at time t = 0 in an incompressible liquid of viscosity η and density ρ situated in a long,
straight, and rigid channel of length L and some constant cross-sectional shape Ω. The
solution is well-known for the case of a cylindrical channel, see e.g. Batchelor (1967), but
in this paper we generalize the results to a cross-section of arbitrary shape. The similarity
between mass and momentum diﬀusion, and the existence of a characteristic diﬀusion
time-scale τdiﬀ = (π/4)(A/P)2/D for mass diﬀusion, Mortensen et al. (2005b), have led

2

us to introduce the momentum diﬀusion time-scale τ deﬁned by

τ =

A
P

2 1
ν

,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where ν = η/ρ is the kinematic viscosity (having dimensions of a diﬀusion constant),
while A and P is the area and perimeter of the cross section Ω, respectively. In this paper
we show that the dynamics of the ﬂow rate Q(t) is universal with τ as the characteristic
time scale.

As shown in Mortensen et al. (2005a) the shape parameters A and P also play an
important role in the steady-state Poiseuille ﬂow. The hydraulic resistance Rhyd can be
expressed as

Rhyd = α

ηL
A2 ≡ αR

∗
hyd,

where α is a dimensionless geometrical correction factor and R∗
hyd = ηL/A2 is a charac-
teristic resistance. Remarkably, α is simply (linearly) related to the dimensionless com-
pactness parameter C = P 2/A.

Above we have emphasized microﬂuidic ﬂows because of the variety of shapes frequently
encountered in lab-on-a-chip systems. However, our results are generally valid for laminar
ﬂows at any length scale.

2. Diﬀusion of momentum

We consider a long, straight channel of length L, aligned with the z-axis, having a
constant cross section Ω with the boundary ∂Ω in the xy plane. The ﬂuid ﬂow is driven
by a pressure gradient of ∇p = −(∆p/L)ex which is turned on abruptly at time t = 0.
We note that strictly speaking the pressure gradient is not established instantaneously,
but rather on a time-scale set by L/c where c is the speed of sound. For typical liquids
c ∼ 103 m/s which for micro-ﬂuidic systems and practical purposes makes the pressure
gradient appear almost instantaneously. From the symmetry of the problem it follows
that the velocity ﬁeld is of the form v(r, t) = v(r⊥, t)ex where r⊥ = yey + zez. From
the Navier–Stokes equation it then follows that v(r⊥, t) is governed by, see e.g. Batchelor
(1967) or Landau & Lifshitz (1987),

∂tv(r⊥, t) − ∇2v(r⊥, t) =

∆p
ηL

,

which is a diﬀusion equation for the momentum with the pressure drop acting as a source
term on the right-hand side. The velocity v is subject to a no-slip boundary condition on
∂Ω and obviously v is initially zero, while it asymptotically approaches the steady-state
velocity ﬁeld v∞(r⊥) for t → ∞.

In the analysis it is natural to write the velocity as a diﬀerence

of the asymptotic, static ﬁeld v∞, solving the Poiseuille problem

v(r⊥, t) = v∞(r⊥) − vh(r⊥, t)

and a time-dependent ﬁeld vh(r⊥, t) satisfying the homogeneous diﬀusion equation,

−∇2v∞(r⊥) =

∆p
ηL

,

∂tvh(r⊥, t) − ∇2vh(r⊥, t) = 0.

From Mortensen et al. (2005b) it is known that rescaling the Helmholz equation by
(A/P)2 leads to a lowest eigenvalue a1 that is of order unity and only weakly geometry
dependent. We therefore perform this rescaling, which naturally implies the time-scale τ
of Eq. (1.1) and the following form of the diﬀusion equation,

where we have introduced the rescaled Laplacian ˆL ,

τ ∂tvh(r⊥, t) − ˆL vh(r⊥, t) = 0.

We note that by the rescaling the Navier–Stokes equation (2.1) becomes

ˆL ≡

3. Hilbert space formulation

In order to solve Eq. (2.7) we will take advantage of the Hilbert space formulation,
Morse & Feshbach (1953), often employed in quantum mechanics, Merzbacher (1970).
The Hilbert space of real functions f (r⊥) is deﬁned by the inner product

and a complete set

φn

of orthonormal basis functions,

(cid:11)
Above, we have used the Dirac bra-ket notation and δnm is the Kronecker delta. We
choose the eigenfunctions {
} of the rescaled Helmholz equation (with a zero Dirichlet
boundary condition on ∂Ω) as our basis functions,

where we have used the sum-rule Eq. (4.3) for An as well as Eq. (4.5). The short time
dynamics can also be inferred directly by integration of the Navier–Stokes equation

Thus initially, the ﬂuid responds to the pressure gradient in the same way as a rigid body
responds to a constant force.

6. Long-time dynamics

As the ﬂow rate increases, friction sets in, and in the long-time limit t ≫ τ the ﬂow-
rate saturates at the value Q∞ where there is a balance between the pressure gradient
and frictional forces. For the long-time saturation dynamics the lowest eigenstate plays
the dominating role and taking only the n = 1 term in Eq. (4.6) we obtain

Q(t)
Q∞

≃ 1 − e

−a1t/τ ,

t ≫ τ /a2,

where we have used that the lowest eigenvalue a1 is non-degenerate to truncate the
summation.

The time it takes to reach steady-state is denoted τ∞. A lower bound τ1 for τ∞ can
be obtained from Eq. (5.3) by assuming that the initial acceleration is maintained until
Q(τ1)/Q∞ = 1 is reached,

(6.2)
A better estimate τ2 for τ∞ is obtained from Eq. (6.1) by demanding Q(τ2)/Q∞ = 1−e−3.

7. Numerical results

Only few geometries allow analytical solutions of both the Helmholz equation and the
Poisson equation. The circle is of course the most well-known example, but the equilat-
eral triangle is another exception. However, in general the equations have to be solved
numerically, and for this purpose we have used the commercially available ﬁnite-element
software Comsol 3.2 (see www.comsol.com). Numbers for a selection of geometries are
tabulated in Table 1.

The circle is the most compact shape and consequently it has the largest value for
A1/A, i.e., the mode has the relatively largest spatial occupation of the total area. The
eigenvalue a1 is of the order unity for compact shapes and in general it tends to increase
slightly with increasing values of C. The modest variation from geometry to geometry in
both a1 and the other parameters suggests that the dynamics of Q(t) will appear almost
universal.

In order to illustrate the validity of our two asymptotic expressions, Eqs. (5.3) and (6.1),
we have compared them using the values for a circular shape to time-dependent ﬁnite-
element simulations of Eq. (2.1). As illustrated in Fig. 1 we ﬁnd a perfect agreement
between the asymptotic expressions Eqs. (5.3) and (6.1) and the numerically exact data
for a circle, a square, and an equilateral triangle. Comparing the corresponding parame-
ters in Table 1 we would expect all data to almost coincide, which is indeed also observed
in Fig. 1. The small spread in eigenvalues and other parameters thus gives rise to close-
to-universal dynamics. From the plot it is also clear that τ is indeed a good estimate for
the time it takes to reach the steady state.

8. Conclusions

In conclusion, by using a compact Hilbert space formalism we have shown how the
initial dynamics in the onset of Poiseuille ﬂow is governed by a universal linear raise in
ﬂow rate Q(t) over a universal time-scale τ above which it saturates exponentially to the
steady-state value Q∞. The steady state is reached after a time τ∞ ≈ Cτ /α. Apart from
being a fascinating example of universal dynamics for a complex problem our results
may have important applications in design of real-time programmable pressure-driven
micro-ﬂuidic networks.

We would like to acknowledge stimulating discussions with F. Okkels.

Figure 1. A log-log plot of the ﬂow rate Q(t)/Q
as a function of time t/τ . The dashed
line is the short-time approximation Eq. (5.3), while the dashed-dotted line is the long-time
approximation Eq. (6.1), both for the case of a circle, i.e., using
/α = 2 and a1 = 1.45 as
listed in Table 1. The data points are the results of time-dependent ﬁnite-element simulations
for the cases of the cross section being a circle (white circles), a square (gray squares), and an
equilateral triangle (black triangles).

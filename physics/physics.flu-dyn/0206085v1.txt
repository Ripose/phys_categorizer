Tidal Theory of the Thermal Wind

Abstract

The baroclinic instability problem is considered in the framework of Laplacian tidal theory. The
Hilbert space of the quasigeostrophic vorticity budget is spanned by spheroidal functions. The ﬂuid
is linearly stable against quasigeostrophic disturbances. As the essential source of irregular ocean-
atmosphere motions, baroclinic instability is ruled out by tidal theory. The midlatitude β-plane
budget of vorticity ﬂuxes is inconsistent with basic laws of motion on the rotating spherical surface.
Realistic numerical simulations of global wave dynamics and dynamical circulation instabilities
require a covariant account of ﬂuid motion on the spherical planet.

I. Introduction

Major diﬃculties in numerical climate simulations result from the fact that the potential energy
in the ocean-atmosphere system is closely associated with large-scale features of its density ﬁeld
while a considerable fraction of its kinetic energy resides on fairly small eddy scales [1]. State-of-the-
art models for weather prediction and climate simulation capture large-scale features of the global
circulation with some degree of realism if they are determined by large-scale features of topography
and external forcing. However, simulation of the dynamical control of density by transfer processes
between the small scales of kinetic energy and the large potential energy scales is less satisfactory [2].
The key to these energy- and vorticity-ﬂuxes is ﬂuid instability. Of the numerous instabilities in the
climate system none is considered as fundamental as baroclinic instability [3]. This concept refers to
the growth of weakly divergent Rossby waves in a stably stratiﬁed and vertically sheared ﬂuid on the
rotating spherical surface. The contemporary understanding of cyclogenesis, predictability-limits and
the transition to chaos, turbulence and stochasticity in the climate system revolves essentially around
this process. Hence, it also provides the paradigm for the design and interpretation of irregular ﬂuid
motion in numerical circulation models, ranging from resolved scales down to the parameterization of
subscale processes.

Baroclinic instability theory invokes four sets of approximations. First: shallow water theory
with constant mean layer-thicknesses and -velocities [3]. Second: quasigeostrophy. For tidal theory,
Longuet-Higgins [4] has shown that this approximate closure of the vorticity budget yields a meaningful
and elegant Rossby wave ﬁlter of Laplace’s tidal equation. In baroclinic ﬂuids this approach governs the
thermal wind. Third: the midlatitude β-plane. To avoid formal diﬃculties with spherical coordinates,
a tangential cartesian plane is pinned to the sphere at some extratropical latitude in analogy to
Kelvin’s well-established equatorial β-plane. Fourth: a number of scaling assumptions which neglect
ﬂuid velocities relative to planet rotation and stratiﬁcation relative to barotropicity wherever it appears
uncritical. Quantitatively, these assumptions seem generally to be justiﬁed [5].

The paper at hand considers the baroclinic instability problem of Laplace’s tidal theory, indepen-
dent of the midlatitude β-plane and scaling assumptions. Tidal theory diﬀers in two aspects from
it is Newtonian (namely: covariant) and accounts consis-
current circulation theories and models:
tently for the globe’s sphericity [6]. The relationship of its analytical structure and the theory of Heun
functions [7] is increasingly understood. While a transformation of the tidal equation into Heun’s
equation is not known, general approximations and exact special cases can be expressed in terms of
Heun functions. These concepts provide a sound foundation for Rayleigh stability analysis in the
framework of global wave-circulation theory. On the basis of covariant ﬂuid dynamics on the rotating

1

spherical surface it will be shown that Rossby wave growth in baroclinic ﬂuids plays a far lesser role
for irregular ocean-atmosphere motions than currently thought.

The geometrically and dynamically consistent way to avoid formal diﬃculties with spherical co-
ordinates is the use of index notation and covariant diﬀerentiation. Here, indices m, n, . . . = 1, 2 run
over longitude λ and latitude ϕ while braced indices (ℓ) = 1, 2 refer to the top and bottom layer of
the ﬂuid and are not subject to the summation convention. Covariant diﬀerentiation will be denoted
by a semicolon. For details of the notation see [6]. In this formalism, equations in curvilinear coordi-
nates look widely similar to corresponding equations in cartesian coordinates with geometrical details
consistently absorbed into core symbols and indices. Thus, formulas emphasize the physical structure
of the problem.

II. Tidal Equations

The problem is considered in terms of the bishallow water equations on the rotating spherical
surface [6]. Rayleigh stability theory requires the linearization of such equations around the considered
basic state. For both layers, the mean layer mass per unit area and hence the concentration are here
assumed to be constant

R = R(1) + R(2) = const,

r = R(1)/R = const.

Thus, the eﬀective pressure P (R, r) and the interfacial potential µ(R, r)

P =

γ(2) (1 + δr2) R2,

µ = γ(2) δ Rr,

1
2

are also constant where γ(ℓ) = g/ρ(ℓ), g the gravitational acceleration and

δ = (ρ(2) − ρ(1))/ρ(1) > 0

the positive deﬁnite stratiﬁcation parameter. The spherical generalization of a constant mean barycen-
tric velocity Vn and a constant mean vertical shear Wn are given by

Vn = a2U0(cos2ϕ, 0),

Wn = a2W (cos2ϕ, 0)

with Earth’s radius a and constant angular velocities

U0 = rU(1) + (1 − r)U(2),

U1 = (1 − r)U(1) + rU(2), W = U(1) − U(2).

The barycentric and baroclinic potential vorticities of this circulation , Z0 and Z1, are obtained as

RZ0 = F0 = 2(Ω + U0)sinϕ,

RZ1 = F1 = 2(Ω + U1)sinϕ

while S = W sinϕ. This circulation is driven by an external, meridionally varying surface pressure
and the value of the vertical shear W is determined by Ω, the stratiﬁcation parameter δ and the
equator-to-pole gradient of the surface pressure [6]. For small-amplitude perturbations (m, η, jn, in)
of the state vector:
layer mass, concentration, barycentric and baroclinic mass ﬂux, linearization of
the bishallow water equations around this circulation leads to the tidal problem [6]

d0m + jn;n = −RW n∂nη

Rd1η + in;n = −r12W n∂nm
d0jn + ǫmnF0jm + ∂np∗ = −W m∂min − 2ǫmnSim

where r12 = r(1 − r) and d0/1 = ∂t + U0/1∂λ. The linearized pressure emerges as

p∗ = (∂R P )r m + (∂r P )R η = c2p1m + c2p2Rη

while one ﬁnds for the linearized interfacial potential

µ∗ = r12R(∂R µ)r m + r12R(∂r µ)R η = c2µ1m + c2µ2Rη.

Here, c2 = γ(2)R and

and baroclinic perturbation vorticity

R2ζ = ǫanin;a −F1Rη − 2r12Sm.

Equations (1) through (8) pose the Rayleigh stability problem for a generic stably stratiﬁed and
vertically sheared ﬂuid on the rotating spherical surface. In spherical bishallow water theory, constant
mean layer-thicknesses exclude a mean ﬂow with available potential energy. The tidal problem for a
circulation with ﬁnite available potential energy is discussed in the Appendix.

III. Quasigeostrophic Stability Analysis

In the barotropic 1-layer limit, equations (1) through (4) reduce to Laplace’s standard tidal equa-
tions. In special cases, exact analytical solutions of the tidal equation are known in terms of conﬂuent
Heun functions, namely spheroidal functions [7, 8]. In the entire wave number space, approximate
analytical solutions can be expressed in terms of spheroidal functions and the asymptotics of tidal
functions coincide with the asymptotic behaviour of prolate spheroidal functions: the Margules regime
of globally deﬁned Legendre polynomials at small Lamb parameters [9] and the Matsuno regime of
Hermite polynomials on the equatorial β-plane at large Lamb parameters [10]. Longuet-Higgins’
quasigeostrophic Rossby wave ﬁlter [4] retains these functional characteristics. In the 1-layer limit,
the perturbation vorticity budget becomes

with perturbation vorticity

R2dtz + ja∂a F = 0

R2z = ǫanjn;a −F m.

As in the strictly nondivergent case, quasigeostrophy assumes that the perturbation mass ﬂux is
suﬃciently represented by a stream function A

jn = ǫnm∂m A

c2m = −F A

while the mass perturbation in (9) is not supposed to vanish, thus giving rise to the notion of weakly
divergent perturbations. A closed expression for (9) is now obtained by invoking the geostrophic
approximation

leading for the vorticity budget to the equation

(∆ − α2y2 − M τ )A = 0

where y = sinϕ, α = 2a(Ω + U )/c the Lamb parameter, M the zonal wave number, ν = a(ω − U M )/c
the Doppler-shifted frequency and τ = α/ν. This is the prolate spheroidal wave equation. The
dispersion relation for quasigeostrophic Rossby waves becomes

ν = −αM/ǫ(N, M ; α)

with prolate spheroidal eigenvalue ǫ(N, M ; α). Comparison of this expression with numerical solutions
of the complete tidal equation (ﬁg.1) demonstrates that with the exception (of the gravity branch)
of the Yanai wave (mode number N=0) quasigeostrophy provides a satisfactory approximation to all
Rossby modes of the tidal problem. Also, this shows that quasigeostrophy is by no means a regional,
e.g. extratropical approximation. Rather, it is globally valid and includes the Margules regime as well
as the Matsuno regime. Physically, the equatorial β-plane approximation of the prolate spheroidal
equation accounts for wave trapping in the Yoshida guide. A similar wave guide in midlatitudes
does not exist and a midlatitude β-plane does not appear in the systematic approximation theory of
spheroidal functions [8].

The functional structure of the tidal problem uniquely determines the physical interpretation of the
so-called “beta-eﬀect” and the spectrum of the tidal wave operator. The Coriolis term of tidal theory
represents the meridional shear of a mean zonal ﬂow with uniform angular velocity Ω + U . Doppler-
shifts only appear with respect to U since the observer corotates with Ω. While the corotating observer
does not see a frequency shift with respect to Ω, the corresponding meridional shear does not vanish
on this transformation. Physically, the “beta-eﬀect” of tidal theory refers to such meridional shear
and diﬀers profoundly from topography on the f-plane.

The spectrum of the tidal wave operator represents free waves in an elastic medium. Such a medium
has two types of excitations:
longitudinal P (primary, pressure or sound) waves and transversal S
(secondary or shear) waves. Long gravity waves of covariant shallow water theory are represented as
longitudinal sound waves with restoring vertical buoyancy forces appearing as an eﬀective “compress-
ibility” of the strictly 2-dimensional system. Correspondingly, shallow baroclinic gravity waves are
represented as second sound in a strictly 2-dimensional biﬂuid. Rossby waves, on the other hand, obey
the dynamics of (radially polarized) shear waves [12]. The frequencies of S-waves are always lower than
P-wave frequencies: all Rossby frequencies lie below gravity frequencies. Rossby waves are transver-
sal and mean ﬂow shear exerts restoring stresses tangential to wave fronts. Low-frequency Rossby
waves are essentially divergence-free and well represented by Margules’ approximation. High Rossby
frequencies are limited by meridional trapping at low latitudes which induces a weak divergence: weak
divergence is characteristic of equatorial Rossby waves. Tropically trapped, weakly divergent Rossby
waves are well approximated by Matsuno’s theory. Longuet-Higgens’ quasigeostrophy uniﬁes both
approaches. With two Lam´e coeﬃcients, elastic wave theory is inherently a two-parameter problem.
This is also true for generic tidal theory: while a “compressibility” controls gravity wave dynam-
ics, the Lamb parameter represents the mean meridional shear that governs Rossby wave dynamics.
Quasigeostrophy is the shear wave ﬁlter of tidal theory.

In application to the present bishallow problem, quasigeostrophy represents the barycentric and

baroclinic mass ﬂux perturbations in terms of stream functions

and determines mass- and concentration-perturbations in (7) and (8) from the thermal wind relation
of (3) and (4)

Solving for m and Rη and inserting the result into (7) and (8) the perturbation vorticities become

jn = ǫnm∂m A,

in = ǫnm∂mψ

c2p1 m + c2p2 Rη = −F0A − 2Sψ
c2µ1 m + c2µ2 Rη = −F1ψ − 2r12SA.

R2z = −(∆ − h0y2)A − hy2ψ

R2ζ = −(∆ − h1y2)ψ − r12hy2A

with

12)/µ2,

h1 = (rp2α2

(2) + α2

1)/µ2,

h = (p2α2

(2) − α12α1)/µ2

where α(ℓ) = 2a(Ω + U(ℓ))/c, α12 = α(1) − α(2) and α1 = 2a(Ω + U1)/c. With these expressions the
vorticity budgets (5) and (6) assume the form

(ω0∆ − H00y2 − f0M )A = (W M (∆ + 2) − H01y2)ψ

(ω1∆ − H11y2 − f1M )ψ = r12(W M (∆ + 2) − H10y2)A.

(10)

(11)

Here, ω0/1 = ω − U0/1M and f0/1 = 2(Ω + U0/1) while

H00 = ω0h0 + r12hW M, H01 = ω0h + h1W M

5

and

H10 = ω1h + h0W M, H11 = ω1h1 + r12hW M.

Equations (10) and (11) are a system of coupled spheroidal equations and spheroidal functions form
a complete set of eigensolutions. Eliminating ∆ψ from these equations yields

with τ(ℓ) = 2(Ω + U(ℓ))/(ω − U(ℓ)M ) and

qψ = (∆ − h0y2 − M τ0)A

q = M τ12 − hy2,

τ12 = τ(1) − τ(2),

τ0 = rτ(1) + (1 − r)τ(2),

τ1 = (1 − r)τ(1) + rτ(2).

Substituting this expression for the baroclinic stream function into (10) results in a single fourth-order
equation

(∆ − h1y2 − M τ1)

(∆ − h0y2 − M τ0)A = r12qA

(12)

q

for the barycentric stream function. Utilizing now the spheroidal property: ∆A = (β2y2 − ǫ)A with

for constant X, equation (12) requires the simultaneous validity of the two quadratic equations

ǫ + M τ0 − (β2 − h0)y2 = Xq

τ12(X 2 + (1 − 2r)X − r12) = 0

X 2h + (h0 − h1)X − r12h = 0.

These two equations express the major diﬀerence between the cartesian and the spherical stability
problem. In cartesian geometry, the dispersion relation determines admissible eigenfrequencies. On
the rotating spherical surface, background inhomogenities due to the planet’s sphericity, coordinate-
dependent Coriolis forces and the mean circulation also determine admissible Lamb parameters.
Rayleigh theory of spatially inhomogeneous systems accounts for wave trapping. The compatibil-
ity of both quadratic equations is determined by the relation

h0 − h1 = (1 − 2r)h − α(1)α(2)/µ2

(13)

which follows from the deﬁnition of h0, h1 and h. Given (13), essentially two classes of solutions
of (12) exist: either, the stratiﬁed background is free of vertical shear or Rossby waves are strictly
nondivergent. In the ﬁrst case: W = 0 and τ12 = 0. Hence: τ0 = τ1 = τ , while q = −hy2 and (12)
becomes

(∆ − β2

1 y2 − M τ )

0 y2 − M τ )A = 0

1
y2 (∆ − β2

where the Lamb parameters are obtained as

β0 = 2a(Ω + U )/c0,

β1 = 2a(Ω + U )/c1

with intrinsic barycentric and baroclinic phase speeds c0/1. The dispersion relation is

(ν0 ǫ(N, M ; β0) + β0M )(ν1 ǫ(N, M ; β1) + β1M ) = 0

with prolate spheroidal eigenvalue ǫ(N, M ; β) and ν0/1 = a(ω − U M )/c0/1. In the shear-free case,
Rossby waves are weakly divergent, propagate as barycentric and baroclinic modes and eigenfrequen-
cies are real. In the second case: c → ∞ and h0 = h1 = h = 0, while q = M τ12 = const so that (12)
reduces to

(∆ − M τ(1))(∆ − M τ(2))A = 0.

6

In the strictly divergence-free case, spheroidal functions degenerate into Legendre polynomials and
the dispersion relation becomes

(ǫ + M τ(1))(ǫ + M τ(2)) = 0
with ǫ(N, M ) = N (N + 1) + (2N + 1)|M | + M 2. The mean vertical shear traps nondivergent Rossby
waves in individual layers and eigenfrequencies are real. This remains true if the mean circulation
exhibits available potential energy [13].

There are two more solutions if in one of the layers α(ℓ) = 0, i.e. U(ℓ) = −Ω. For α(j) = 0, Rossby

waves exist only in the complementary layer ℓ 6= j and from (12) one ﬁnds the dispersion relation

with Lamb parameter

ǫ(N, M ; β(ℓ)) = −M τ(ℓ)

(ℓ) = 4a2(Ω + U(ℓ))2/g
β2

H(ℓ)

′

where H(ℓ) = R(ℓ)/ρ(ℓ) is the mean layer-thickness and g′ = g(ρ(2) − ρ(1))/ρ(2) the reduced gravity
accelaration. Both of these solutions are weakly divergent and stable. The condition U(j) = −Ω
implies a westward ﬂow circulating the globe in one day. Hence, the layer is at rest in a nonrotating,
inertial system and such conditions do not admit Rossby wave propagation (the mean meridional shear
is absent). In the rotating system, corresponding large-scale velocities are of a magnitude that is not
met on this planet. For practical purposes these solutions are hence of little signiﬁcance.

The same dispersion relations follow if A and ψ in (10) and (11) are replaced with spheroidal
functions and the resulting system of 3 algebraic equations is solved for the unknown Lamb parameters
and eigenfrequencies (see Appendix). As a further alternative, the layer representation of spherical
linearized bishallow water [13] may be chosen as starting point for the stability analysis rather than
the modal representation (1) through (4). It is readily seen that the dispersion relation from such an
approach coincides with the results obtained above (see Appendix). The baroclinic instability problem
of tidal theory does not assume the form of a spherical Taylor-Couette ﬂow and all eigenfrequencies are
real. Unlike baroclinic gravity waves, Rossby waves do not feed on the energy of a stably stratiﬁed and
vertically sheared mean ﬂow. Thus, the ﬂow is linearly stable against quasigeostrophic disturbances.
For the system (1) through (4) isopycnals coincide with equipotential surfaces. This type of
conﬁguration is generally considered in baroclinic instability theory:
isopycnals are assumed to be
“ﬂat” and a slope-parameter does not enter the problem [3]. On the other hand, observers and
modellers are typically concerned with sloped isopycnals and their erosion by baroclinic instability
[2]. The tidal equations for bishallow water with sloping isopycnals are well known and their stability
against nondivergent Rossby waves has been demonstrated [13]. The stability of such a system against
quasigeostrophic Rossby waves is shown in the Appendix.

The physical interpretation of these results is best considered in comparison to Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. For this instability, highly divergent baroclinic gravity waves continuously sample both
layers of a stably stratiﬁed and vertically sheared ﬂuid. The dynamics of baroclinic gravity waves are
controlled by the competition of (stabilizing) stratiﬁcation and (destabilizing) vertical shear. If the
vertical shear becomes too large, baroclinic gravity waves grow. None of these mechanisms plays a role
in tidal Rossby wave dynamics. Rossby waves are inseparably linked to a deﬁnite value of the mean
meridional shear determined by Ω + U(ℓ). Hence, they propagate in individual layers and a distinction
of barycentric and baroclinic Rossby waves is meaningless (unless the vertical shear vanishes). Weak
divergencies are associated with meridional trapping and do not accommodate the exploration of
adjacent layers. None of the mean ﬂow features of a stably stratiﬁed, vertically sheared ﬂow competes
with the restoring stresses. Thus, a transfer of energy or vorticity between this type of circulation and
Rossby waves is excluded in the framework of tidal theory.

Although mean ﬂow available potential energy may alter the system’s wave guide geography rad-
ically, it does not change its stability properties. For very low-frequency Rossby waves, isopycnal
slopes modify the eﬀective Lamb parameter (see Appendix). This parameter may now assume real or

7

imaginary values. In the event of imaginary Lamb parameters, spheroidal wave operators change from
prolate to oblate [8] and Rossby waves may be meridionally trapped in a polar wave guide [13, 14, 15].
Although the Lamb parameter of oblate Rossby waves becomes imaginary, their frequencies remain
real [8] and Rossby wave amplitudes do not commence growing. In general, a stably stratiﬁed and
vertically sheared ﬂuid with or without available potential energy lacks the faculties of energy- and
vorticity-transfer to Rossby waves. This statement may require modiﬁcation for certain initial condi-
tions or the extremely steep isopycnals associated with outcropping. Independent of the role, these
and other special cases may take, Laplace’s tidal theory does not support the ubiquity, baroclinic
instability is currently thought to have for irregular ocean-atmosphere motions.

IV. Discussion

The results of the previous section are in clear contrast to baroclinic instability theory on the
midlatitude β-plane. To identify the source of this discrepancy evaluate the midlatitude β-plane
In this sense, the latitude y is ﬁxed at some (extratropical) value y∗ while
approximation of (12).
1 = h1y2
∗, G2
G2
∗ are considered as constant parameters. Adopting furthermore a
cartesian Laplace operator and trigonometric eigenfunctions with K 2 = a2(k2

0 = h0y2

(K 2 + G2

A little algebra readily shows that this expression is equivalent to

(2) + M τ(2)) = sF 2

(1)F 2
(2)

(ℓ)y2

(ℓ) = β2

with s = ρ(1)/ρ(2) and F 2
∗. This equation is quadratic in frequency. Unlike the results
of the previous section, its roots do not assume an easily interpreted form. This is indicative of
the diﬃculties of the primarily geometrical midlatitude β-plane approximation to accommodate the
system’s physical structure. Nevertheless, the reality of these roots is obvious and the midlatitude
β-plane approximation to the ﬁnal wave equation (12) comes qualitatively to the same result as the
spherical analysis with respect to stability. Hence, the trigonometric approximation of wave functions
in itself - though unsatisfactory - is uncritical. The source of discrepancies is therefore a fundamentally
diﬀerent account of vorticity ﬂuxes by covariant shallow waters and baroclinic instability theory.

In the covariant case, the vorticity budget (12) is uniquely determined by the equations of motion
(1) through (4) and the quasigestrophic thermal wind approximation. The validity of quasigeostrophy
for the barotropic ﬂuid is well demonstrated by ﬁg.1 and the particular form of the same argument for
the baroclinic system is again an unambiguous consequence of the equations of motion. These equa-
tions are the direct and unique result of the application of covariance requirements to the formulation
of spherical shallow water dynamics. Thus, the vorticity ﬂuxes of covariant shallow water theory are
in essence the expression of basic geometrical and physical consistency conditions for the hydrostatic
ﬂow of the stably stratiﬁed and vertically sheared ﬂuid on the rotating spherical surface.

Standard baroclinic instability theory, on the other hand, takes the Primitive Equations [16] as a
starting point and invokes the midlatitude β-plane approximation to derive the vorticity budget [3]. It
has been shown that the Primitive Equations do not pose a covariant dynamical problem and involve
ambiguous mass and momentum ﬂuxes as a consequence of the violation of Newton’s ﬁrst law [6].
For the vorticity budget it now becomes important that the midlatitude β-plane is much more poorly
deﬁned than the equatorial β-plane. Eﬀectively, it takes the role of a geometric closure assumption
which introduces ill-deﬁned vorticity ﬂuxes. In the stability analysis this inconsistency resurfaces as
spurious Rossby wave growth, i.e. baroclinic instability.

Vorticity ﬂuxes are crucial in maintaining and changing the density ﬁeld of the ocean-atmosphere
system and a consistent representation of vorticity dynamics is indispensable for realistic numerical
simulations of the global circulation. At this time, a large number of numerical circulation models is

8

based on the Primitive Equations. Moreover, most models are not formulated in terms of spherical
coordinates but utilize a multi-β-plane approach to approximate the globe’s sphericity: Laplace oper-
ators, for instance, are coded as a sum of second order derivatives, ignoring ﬁrst order contributions
from nontrivial Christoﬀel symbols. Widely independent of spatio-temporal resolution and the quality
of subscale parametrizations, such models cannot expect to simulate the large-scale circulation with
geometric-dynamic integrity and realism.

Theoretically as well as numerically, large-scale ocean-atmosphere dynamics require a covariant
dynamical framework including the acknowledgement of the spherical geometry of the planet’s surface.
The linear stability of the baroclinic ﬂuid against quasigeostrophic disturbances calls for a covariant
reanalysis of the observational evidence on dynamical instabilities in the ocean-atmosphere system.

For 0 ≤ |b(ℓ)| ≪ 1 these equations are a coupled system of spheroidal equations. Physically, this
condition on the slope parameters excludes outcropping of isopycnals. With

the quasigeostrophic vorticity budgets assume the form

(∆ − h(1)y2 − M τ(1))A(1) = −skβ(1)β(2)y2A(2)

where k = qH (1)
E . Note that h(ℓ) will become negative for very low Rossby wave frequencies
at negative b(ℓ)M . Using now ∆A(ℓ) = (β2y2 − ǫ)A(ℓ), these equations reduce to a system of coupled
algebraic equations for the amplitudes of the stream functions. Nontrivial solutions exist for vanishing
coeﬃcients of the polynomial X + Y y2 + Zy4. For the present problem, these coeﬃcients have the
form

X = (ǫ + M τ(1))(ǫ + M τ(2)) = 0
Y = (ǫ + M τ(1))(β2 − h(2)) + (ǫ + M τ(2))(β2 − h(1)) = 0

Z = β4 − (h(1) + h(2))β2 + h(1)h(2) − sβ2

(2) = 0

The ﬁrst of these equations states the reality of eigenfrequencies for stream functions which remain
regular at the poles. Also, it demonstrates that Rossby waves propagate in layers unless the vertical
shear vanishes. The second equation selects the Lamb parameter for the respective mode and the
third equation determines the Lamb parameters. For b(ℓ) = 0 the solutions of the main text emerge
while the case c → ∞ and b(ℓ) 6= 0 has been discussed in [13].

Abstract

We consider pressure-driven ﬂows of electrolyte solutions in small channels or capillaries in which

tracer particles are used to probe velocity proﬁles. Under the assumption that the double layer is

thin compared to the channel dimensions, we show that the ﬂow-induced streaming electric ﬁeld

can create an apparent slip velocity for the motion of the particles, even if the ﬂow velocity still

satisﬁes the no-slip boundary condition. In this case, tracking of particle would lead to the wrong

conclusion that the no-slip boundary condition is violated. We evaluate the apparent slip length,

compare with experiments, and discuss the implications of these results.

Introduction

The no-slip boundary condition of ﬂuid mechanics states that the velocity of a viscous ﬂow vanishes

near a stationary solid surface [1]. Although it has been a crucial ingredient of our understanding of

ﬂuid mechanics for more than a century, it has been much debated in the past [2], and, in the case of

liquids, a complete physical picture for its origin has yet to be given. The ongoing debate stems from

the fact that it is an assumption which cannot be derived from ﬁrst principles. It has been shown that

on length scales much larger than the scale of surface heterogeneities, the no-slip condition might be a

macroscopic consequence of inevitable microscopic roughness [3, 4], but the case of perfectly smooth

surfaces has yet to be explained. In particular, the physico-chemical properties of both the ﬂuid and

the solid surface certainly are important.

Only a few experimental studies have addressed the no-slip condition in the past [5, 6], and it is only

the recent advances in the controlled fabrication of micro- and nano-devices and in the corresponding

measurement techniques that have allowed the problem to be reconsidered. Over the last few years,

a number of pressure-driven ﬂow [7, 8, 9, 10], shear-ﬂow [11], and squeeze-ﬂow experiments [12, 13,

14, 15, 16, 17, 18] showing a response interpretable as some degree of slip for partially wetting liquids

1

have been reported. Molecular dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones liquids have also shown that

slip can occur, but only at unrealistically high shear rates [19, 20].

Fluid slip is usually quantiﬁed by a slip length λ. Let us consider for simplicity a unidirectional

ﬂow past a solid surface. Following Navier [21], the slip length linearly relates the surface slip velocity

to the shear rate of the ﬂuid evaluated at the surface

u = λ

∂u
∂n

·

(3)

The slip length can also be interpreted as the ﬁctitious distance below the surface at which the velocity

would be equal to zero if extrapolated linearly: the no-slip boundary condition is equivalent to λ = 0

and a no-shear boundary condition is equivalent λ = ∞.

Consider pressure-driven ﬂow in a two-dimensional channel of height 2h. If we assume that the

boundary condition on the channel walls (z = ±h) is given by (1), the axial velocity proﬁle in the

channel is

Experimentalists have usually addressed the issue of ﬂuid slip in two distinct ways. The ﬁrst

consists in performing indirect measurements, such as pressure-drop versus ﬂow rate or squeezing rate

versus resistance, and then use such measurements to infer a slip length. This procedure is indirect in

the sense that it assumes that the ﬂow resembles (2) and then equation (3), or an equivalent, is used

to determine λ [7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

The second way consists in performing direct velocity measurements in the ﬂuid. We are only

aware of two such previous works. Pit et al. [11] measured velocities in shear ﬂow of hexadecane over

a smooth surface using a technique based on ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (see also [22]).

The measurements were performed down to 80 nm from the solid surface and averaged over a few tens

of microns. Fluid slip was observed with λ ∼ 100 nm in the case of lyophobic surfaces. Tretheway &

Meinhart (2001) [9] used micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques to measure the velocities

of tracer nanoparticles (radius 150 nm) in pressure-driven channel ﬂow of water. Measurements were

made down to 450 nm from the solid surface and cross-correlated to increase signal-to-noise ratios.

Results consistent with the no-slip condition were obtained in completely wetting conditions, but slip

with λ ∼ 1 µm was obtained when the channel walls were treated to be hydrophobic.

In this paper, we wish to draw attention to some of the possible consequences of this latter type of

particle-based measurements. We address theoretically a prototypical pressure-driven ﬂow experiment

in small channels in the case where small tracer particles are used to probe the ﬂuid velocity. We show

that if electrical eﬀects for both the channel and the particles are properly taken into account, it is

2

possible for the particles to behave as if they were advected by a ﬂow with a ﬁnite non-zero slip length,

even if the velocity proﬁle in the ﬂuid surrounding the particle does not violate the no-slip condition.

In the following section we summarize some important background electrostatics and hydrodynam-

ics results, derive the formulae in the case of two dimensional channels and introduce the electroviscous

eﬀect. In section 3 we present a physical picture for the eﬀect we report, derive the expressions for

the apparent slip lengths and give the conditions for the occurrence of such slip. Finally, in section 4

we discuss implications of these results along with estimates of their order of magnitude under typical

experimental conditions and compare with experiments.

2 Flow of an electrolyte solution

The physical picture for the eﬀect we wish to introduce relies on the following known facts.

2.1 Surface charge and electrostatics

A solid surface in contact with an electrolyte solution will in general acquire a net charge, due for

example to the ionization of surface groups, ion adsorption and/or dissolution. This surface charge is a

thermodynamic property of the solid-electrolyte pair and the reader is referred to [23, 29] for detailed

presentations of the phenomenon. The equilibrium surface potential is called the zeta potential ζ.

Such surface charges are screened by a diﬀusive cloud of counter-ions in the solution. At equilib-

rium, the electrostatic potential ψ in the electrolyte satisﬁes the Poisson-Boltzmann equation which

quantiﬁes the balance between purely electrostatic interactions and diﬀusion [23],

∇2ψ =

2en0
ǫǫ0

sinh

eψ
kBT

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

where we consider here for simpliﬁcation only the case of monovalent 1:1 ions, e.g. Na+ and Cl− or
OH− and H+.

A convenient approximation usually made to solve (4) is the Debye-H¨uckel approximation [23, 25,

27, 28] of small ﬁeld strength, |eψ| ≪ kBT , in which case the equation simpliﬁes to the linearized
Poisson-Boltzmann equation

∇2ψ = κ2ψ,

κ−1 =

ǫǫ0kBT
2e2n0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

1/2

,

where κ−1 is the Debye screening length:

it is the typical length scale in the solution over which

counter-ions screen the charged solid surface, and beyond which the net charge density is essentially

zero.

However, (5) is restricted to low surface potentials, typically 20mV, which is a severe approxima-

tion. Let us consider for simplicity the case of a two-dimensional channel of height 2h in the z-direction

(4)

(5)

3

and let us instead derive the solution to (4) for any value of the zeta potential at the wall ζw but in
the limit where the channel dimensions are much larger than the double layers κh ≫ 1. This limit is

appropriate for channel sizes down to h ≈ 5 µm in the case of pure water, or even h ≈ 50 nm in the

case of tap water.

Let us deﬁne the dimensionless potential φ = eψ/kB T and the dimensionless vertical coordinate

¯z = z/h. In this case, (4) becomes

d2φ
d¯z2 = sinh φ,
with the boundary conditions φ(¯z = ±1) = φw = eζw/kBT .

1
(κh)2

Since 1/κh ≪ 1, the solution to equation (6) involves boundary layers near z = ±1. The outer

solution φ out is found by taking the limit 1/κh = 0 in (6) and we ﬁnd φ out = 0. The inner solution φ in
is valid near the boundaries for κh(1−|¯z|) = O(1), in which case (6) reduces to the Poisson-Boltzmann

equation near an inﬁnite plane, whose solution is [27]

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

φw

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

= tanh

e−κh(1−|¯z|).

Finally, since φ out = 0, the inner solution (7) is also equal to the composite solution φ(¯z), uniformly
valid throughout the channel as κh → ∞, at leading order in 1/κh. For convenience, equation (7) can

be rewritten as

φ(¯z) = 2 ln

1 + twe−κh(1−|¯z|)
1 − twe−κh(1−|¯z|) !

,

 

where we have deﬁned tw = tanh(eζw/4kBT ).

2.2 Hydrodynamics and electrokinetics

When a pressure-driven ﬂow occurs in the channel, the ﬂuid velocity is unidirectional U = U (z)ex,
where ex is the streamwise direction. In the absence of electrical eﬀects, the ﬂuid velocity is simply
Poiseuille’s pressure-driven formula [1], which we will denote UPD, and is given by

UPD(z) = −

(cid:20)

Furthermore, if an external, or induced, electric ﬁeld ES = ESex is also applied to the channel,
the presence of a net charge density near the solid surface moving in response to the ﬁeld leads to

an additional velocity component known as electroosmotic ﬂow (EOF) [23].

It is directed in the

x-direction, is given by

2.3 Streaming potential and electroviscous eﬀect

As the electrolyte solution ﬂows down a pressure gradient, the cloud of counter-ions is advected by

the ﬂow and a streaming current is established. If no short-circuit is present between the two ends

of the capillary, accumulation of charge sets up a potential diﬀerence along the channel, termed the

“streaming potential”. Such potential, or equivalently electric ﬁeld, opposes the mechanical transfer

of charge by creating a reverse conduction current through the bulk solution such that the total net

electric current is zero. This induced axial electric ﬁeld scales with the applied pressure gradient and

leads to the creation of an induced electroosmotic back-ﬂow which eﬀectively slows down the ﬂuid

motion in the capillary: a smaller ﬂow rate for a given pressure drop is obtained than in the regular

Poiseuille case, as if the liquid had a higher shear viscosity than expected. Consequently this eﬀect is

usually referred to as the primary “electroviscous eﬀect” [24, 25, 26, 27, 28].

Let us consider the pressure-driven ﬂow in a channel of height 2h and width w ≫ h of the

electrolyte solution with electrostatic potential given by equation (7). We calculate below the value
of the steady-state streaming electric ﬁeld ESex induced by the ﬂow.

Pressure-driven current First, the pressure-driven motion of the screening cloud of counter-ions

3 Velocity of a suspended particle and apparent slip

3.1 Physical picture

We now consider an experiment in which the above electric eﬀects are present. We elect to use small

tracer particles to probe the velocity proﬁle, including possible ﬂuid slip, as illustrated in Figure 1.

For the same reason as for the capillary surfaces, these particles will usually be charged in solution.

As they are advected by the ﬂuid motion, they will also feel the inﬂuence of the induced streaming

electric ﬁeld: consequently their velocity will not only reproduce that of the ﬂuid but will also include

an induced electrophoretic component [23], proportional to their zeta potential and the streaming

electric ﬁeld. If the zeta potential of a particle has a sign opposite to that of the capillary surface, the

particle will be slowed down by the electric ﬁeld. On the contrary, if the particle possesses a potential

of the same sign as the capillary surface, its electrophoretic component will be in the streamwise

direction; furthermore, if its zeta potential is large enough, the electrophoretic velocity of the particle

will be able to overcome the induced electroosmotic back-ﬂow.

It then follows that there is a signiﬁcant potential implication of the induced electric ﬁeld:

if

one were to conduct an experiment in such conditions without considering any important electrical

eﬀects, these particles would go faster than the expected Poiseuille pressure-driven proﬁle, leading to

the incorrect conclusion that the velocity proﬁle has a non-zero slip velocity at the wall. Thus, even

if the ﬂow satisﬁes the no-slip condition, measurements of particle velocities would lead to non-zero

apparent slip lengths. We shall quantify this mechanism in the following sections.

3.2 Particle velocity

We consider the presence of a single solid spherical particle of radius a ≪ h suspended in a two-

dimensional channel of height 2h where a pressure-driven ﬂow occurs, as illustrated in Figure 1; the

particle is located at a distance d = h − |z| from the closest wall. We also assume for simplicity that

the presence of the particle does not modify the nature of ionic groups in solution (1:1 monovalent
ions), so that the screening lengths κ−1 for the charged particle and the charged channel surface are

the same, as given by equation (5).

The particle velocity UP(z) will in general be

UP(z) = Uhydro(z) + Uelec(z) + UkBT,

which includes three contributions.

Hydrodynamic contribution The ﬁrst component is the hydrodynamic contribution

which slow down the motion of the suspended particle. Although the analysis is in general diﬃcult

It is modiﬁed by the presence of solid walls

[30], walls lead to a leading-order correction to the particle velocity of order of the ratio of the particle

size to the distance to the walls O(a/d); this is true as long as the particle does not come too close to

the wall, in which case a diﬀerent contribution arises from lubrication forces. We will assume in this

paper that the particle is located suﬃciently far from the walls (a ≪ d = h − |z|) so that the inﬂuence

of the walls can be neglected. Such a requirement would also have to be veriﬁed in an experiment,

otherwise the presence of the wall would hinder some component of the measured slip velocity. Note

that if walls were not present, a correction to the velocity accounting for the ﬁnite size of the particle

and the spatial variations of the ﬂuid velocity would also be present, but only at second order in the

ratio of the particle size to the length scale over which ﬂow variations occur [31].

Electrical contribution In general the particle will be charged, with a zeta potential ζp which we
assume to be uniform. Consequently, its velocity will include a contribution from electrical forces,
Uelec(z). This velocity has two components

Uelec(z) = UEPH + Udrift(z) ez,

(26)

where UEPH is an electrophoretic velocity due to the presence of an external electric ﬁeld and Udrift(z)
is a vertical drift due to the electrostatic interactions between the charged particle and the charged

8

walls. Such drift will only be signiﬁcant if the double layers around the particle and along the channel

walls overlap, and will be exponentially screened otherwise [23]. We will assume that such requirement

is met in practice κd & O(1), so that it can be neglected.

When the electric ﬁeld ES = ESex is aligned with the channel direction, the electrophoretic velocity

UEPH = UEPH ex is given by

UEPH =

(cid:20)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(27)

This velocity ﬁrst includes the “pure” electrophoretic mobility of the particle [23, 27, 32], characterized

by the function f (x), which satisﬁes f (0) = 2/3 (H¨uckel’s result for thick screening length) and

f (∞) = 1 (Smoluchowski’s result for thin screening length). Note that we can use these classical

electrophoretic formulae because since κh ≫ 1, the perturbation of the ion distribution in the double

layer around the particle is not modiﬁed by the local shear ﬂow. The velocity (27) also includes

the electroosmotic back-ﬂow resulting from the motion of excess charges near the channel walls and

proportional to the wall zeta potential ζw. Furthermore, the presence of a wall always inﬂuences the
electrophoretic mobility at cubic order in the ratio of the particle size to the distance to the wall, as

long as double layers do not overlap [34, 35]; since we already assumed the particle to be located far

from the wall, we will neglect the wall inﬂuence here as well.

Thermal contribution Finally, the particle velocity has a random contribution UkBT due to ther-
mal motion, which can be signiﬁcant. A solid spherical particle of radius a, located far from boundaries,

has a diﬀusivity D given by the Stokes-Einstein relation D = kBT /6πµa [23], corresponding to a root
mean square velocity on the order of UkB T ∼ D/a ∼ kBT /6πµa2. At 25◦C in water, a = 10 nm
leads to UkB T ∼ 1 mm/s; this value is of the same order as the ﬂuid velocity in a circular capillary of
radius R ∼ 100 µm and ﬂow rate Q ∼ 1 µL/min, typical values for microﬂuidic devices. Consequently,

we cannot assume that the Peclet number, P e = U/UkB T = U a/D, is necessarily large and thermal
motion cannot in general be neglected. However, in the experiments reported to date, velocity mea-

surements are cross correlated (as in [9]) or averaged (as in [11]) so that the random thermal motion

disappears, and we will therefore not consider it in this paper.

Summary Under the previous assumptions, we can write the velocity for the particle as

3.3 Apparent slip length

We now calculate the apparent slip length λ that would be inferred by tracking particle motion in a

pressure-driven ﬂow. In the limit κh ≫ 1, the streaming electric ﬁeld is given by equation (21) so that

the particle velocity (28) becomes, at leading order in a/d and 1/κh,

This result can also be understood in the following way: (1) the particle and the wall must have the

same charge sign, ζwζp > 0; this is usually the case in water where surfaces typically acquire negative
charge, for example due to the ionization of sulfate or carboxylic surface groups; (2) the particle zeta

potential must be suﬃciently large |ζp| > |ζw|/f (κa) (or, equivalently, the wall zeta potential must be
suﬃciently small). If condition (31) is not met, the slip length is in fact a “stick” length (λ < 0) and

the particle goes slower than the liquid. Finally, note that within the Debye-H¨uckel limit tw ≪ 1, the
slip length (30) becomes

4 Discussion

The results presented in the previous section allow one to calculate, for a given set of experimentally

determined material and ﬂuid parameters, the amount of apparent slip in the particle velocity which

is due to the streaming potential. We present in this section some general observations on formula

(30) as well as an estimate for the order of magnitude of the eﬀect in water and a comparison with

available experimental slip measurements.

4.1 Variations of the slip length

All the variables in (30) can be made to vary independently except for the screening length κ−1 and

the bulk conductivity σ which both depend on the ionic strength of the solution. A simple estimate

line), n0 = 10−2 mol l−1 (tap water, κ−1 ≈ 3 nm, dotted line).

for the bulk conductivity of a 1:1 solution is σ = 2bn0e2 (see e.g.
[28]), where n0 is the bulk ion
concentration and b is the ion mobility, which we approximate by the mobility of a spherical particle,
b−1 ≈ 6πµℓ where ℓ is the eﬀective ion size. Using equation (5), we see that the conductivity and the

screening length are related by

σ ≈

(33)

Furthermore, since the conductivity σ and the viscosity µ only appear in (30) as their product,

the estimate (33) shows that the apparent slip length (30) is in fact independent of the ﬂuid viscosity.
Moreover, since κ ∼ n1/2
and σ ∼ n0, and since f (κa) varies only weakly with κ, we see from (30)
that the λ is a decreasing function of the ionic strength. Also, it is clear from (30) that the slip length

0

always decreases with the channel size.

Finally, we note the apparent slip length (30) vanishes for two values of the wall zeta potential:

ζw = 0 and ζw = ζp/f (κa). Consequently, in between these two values, the slip length reaches a
maximum value l when the wall zeta potential is equal to ζw = ζ ∗
m) = 0. This is
illustrated in Figure 2 (left).

4.2 Order of magnitude for water

Let us address here the case of water at room temperature (T=300◦C, ǫ=80, ℓ ≈ 2 ˚A). We have

calculated numerically the maximum apparent slip lengths which could be obtained in an experiment,

11

λ∗, as a function of the particle zeta potential ζp. The results are displayed in Figure 2 (right). We
ﬁrst note that λ∗ increases with |ζp|. Furthermore, the maximum slip length can take values as low as
molecular sizes or below and, in the case of pure water, can be as high as hundreds of nanometers.

The data for the low values of |ζp| display a power-law behavior, which we can analyze as follows.
Let us consider formula (30). The two terms in the denominator will be of the same order of magnitude
if tw is larger than a critical value ˜tw which is given by

where we have used (33) to relate the conductivity to the screening length. The smallest value of (34)
will be obtained, say, for κh ≈ 10, in which case we get ˜tw ≈ 0.86 which corresponds to a critical wall
zeta potential ˜ζw ≈ 135 mV. Consequently, when ζw . ˜ζw, (30) can be simpliﬁed to

4.3 Comparison with experiments

The exponent 2 given by equation (36) agrees well with the power-law data presented in Figure 2

Two comparisons with experimental results can now be given. First, we wish to comment on the

general order of magnitude of the slip lengths obtained. For a review of the pressure-driven ﬂow

experiments in capillaries which report some degree of slip as summarized in the introduction, the

reader is referred to [36].

The order of magnitude for the maximum slip lengths given by our mechanism (tens to hundreds

of nanometers) are consistent with the slip lengths measured in the indirect pressure-driven slip exper-

iments of [6, 8, 10]. Of course, the eﬀect we report here does not directly apply to their pressure drop

versus ﬂow rate measurements, but the comparison shows that both eﬀects are comparable in magni-

tude and therefore the apparent slip mechanism could have important consequences on experimental

probing of the no-slip boundary condition.

We also wish to address speciﬁcally the experiment of Tretheway & Meinhart [9] for which our

study directly applies. The channels used in their experiment have height 2h = 30 µm and width

2w = 300 µm; the separation of scale w ≫ h allows us to approximate the ﬂow by that between

two parallel plates with h = 15 µm. Details of the electrical characteristics of the water used in

the experiment were not reported, but the water was deionized; we will therefore assume that the
ion concentration was small and will take it to be that of pure water n0 ≈ 10−6 mol l−1 for which

12

κ−1 ≈ 300 nm, so that κh ≈ 50. Particles with radius a =150 nm were used in the P.I.V. system, so

that κa ≈ 1/2, for which we will approximate f (κa) ≈ 2/3. If we assume |ζp| = 10 mV, we obtain
that λ∗ is essentially zero. If however |ζp| = 50 mV, we get λ∗ ≈ 1 nm and |ζp| = 200 mV leads to
λ∗ ≈ 18 nm. Although beyond molecular size, these values are much too small to explain the data

reported in [9] where λ ≈ 1 µm. As a consequence, we can conclude that the eﬀect reported here is

probably not responsible for the large slip length observed in [9]. Alternative mechanisms would have

to be invoked to explain the data, such as the presence of surface attached bubbles [36].

5 Conclusion

We have reported in this paper the following new mechanism. When small charged colloidal particles

are used in a pressure-driven ﬂow experiment to probe the proﬁle of the velocity ﬁeld of an electrolyte

solution (e.g. P.I.V. in water), their velocities may include an “apparent slip” component even though

the velocity ﬁeld in the ﬂuid does not violate the no-slip boundary condition. This apparent slip is

in fact an electrophoretic velocity for the particles which are subject to the streaming potential, i.e.,

the ﬂow-induced potential diﬀerence that builds up along the channel due to the advection of free

screening charges by the ﬂow. A similar eﬀect is expected to occur in shear-driven ﬂows.

The expected maximum orders of magnitude for the apparent slip lengths were given under normal

conditions in water. Although the eﬀect was found to be too small to explain the data reported in

[9], its magnitude is consistent with other indirect investigations of ﬂuid slip in pressure-driven ﬂow

experiments. As a consequence, the analysis presented here could be a useful tool for experimentalists

by allowing them to estimate quantitatively the importance of this apparent slip in their experiments.

The idea that free passive particles could go faster than the surrounding ﬂowing liquid, although

counter-intuitive at ﬁrst, is in fact not unnatural: a similar phenomenon occurs in electrophoresis

where, beyond the double layer, the ambient liquid is at rest. We also note from equation (30) and

the scalings presented above that the eﬀect increases when the ionic strength of the solution, and

therefore its conductivity, decreases; this is because ﬂow of an electrolyte with low ion concentration

will necessary lead to the induction of a large streaming electric ﬁeld to counteract the advection-of-

charge electric current.

The model chosen for the calculations used several simplifying assumptions. Our calculations were

two-dimensional and we neglected in the model the eﬀect of surface conductance as well as interactions

between particles. We also assumed that the streaming electric ﬁeld was uniform on the length scale

of the particle and its double layer. We do not expect that relaxing these assumptions would change

qualitatively the physical picture introduced in this paper.

Variational principle for frozen-in vortex structures interacting with sound waves

(Dated: July 16, 2011)

General properties of conservative hydrodynamic-type models are treated from positions of the
canonical formalism adopted for liquid continuous media, with applications to the compressible Eu-
lerian hydrodynamics, special- and general-relativistic ﬂuid dynamics, and two-ﬂuid plasma model
including the Hall-magnetohydrodynamics. A variational formulation is found for motion and in-
teraction of frozen-in localized vortex structures and acoustic waves in a special description where
dynamical variables are, besides the Eulerian ﬁelds of the ﬂuid density and the potential component
of the canonical momentum, also the shapes of frozen-in lines of the generalized vorticity. This
variational principle can serve as a basis for approximate dynamical models with reduced number
of degrees of freedom.

INTRODUCTION

Lagrangian of vortex lines.

In many physical systems the motion of continu-
ous liquid media can be approximately described by
hydrodynamic-type equations having a remarkable math-
ematical structure based on an underlying variational
least action principle in the Lagrangian description [1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The characteristic feature of the
hydrodynamic-type systems is that they possess, besides
the usual integrals of motion (the total energy, the total
linear momentum, and the total angular momentum),
also an inﬁnite number of speciﬁc integrals of motion re-
lated to the freezing-in property of canonical vorticity
[2, 3, 4]. Thus, hydrodynamic equations describe an in-
teraction between ”soft” degrees of freedom of – frozen-in
vortices, and ”hard” degrees of freedom – acoustic modes.
However, in the Eulerian description of ﬂows by the den-
sity and by the velocity (or the canonical momentum)
ﬁelds, vortices and sound waves are ”mixed”. Another
point is that due to unresolved freezing-in constraints,
the Eulerian equations of motion do not follow directly
from a variational principle (see [2] for discussion). This
work has two main purposes. The ﬁrst purpose is to
introduce a such general description of ideal ﬂows, that
soft and hard degrees of freedom are explicitly separated,
and the frozen-in property of the vorticity is taken into
account. The second purpose is to formulate a principle
of least action in this representation. As the result, the
acoustic waves will be described by the Eulerian ﬁelds
of the ﬂuid density and the potential component of the
canonical momentum, while the canonical vorticity will
be represented as a continuous distribution of frozen-
in vortex lines (the so called formalism of vortex lines
[3, 4, 5], that previously was applied only to static den-
sity proﬁles). The Lagrangian of this dynamical system is
a non-trivial uniﬁcation of the canonical Lagrangian cor-
responding to purely potential ﬂows, with a generalized

II. CANONICAL FORMALISM FOR FLUIDS

A. Generalized Euler equation

Typically in a complex classical system on the micro-
scopic level there are permanently existing particles of
several kinds, for instance, molecules in a gas, or the
electrons and ions in a plasma. In general situation, dif-
ferent components can have diﬀerent macroscopically av-
eraged velocities near a same point and/or diﬀerent rel-
ative concentrations in separated points. In such cases,
each population of the complex ﬂuid should be included
into consideration individually, for example, as in the
two-ﬂuid plasma model discussed some later in this work.
Now for simplicity we are going to consider the case when
the macroscopic velocities of all components coincide and
mutual relations between the concentrations are homoge-
neous in space and time, so the macroscopically averaged
physical state of the medium at a given point r = (x, y, z)
at a given time moment t is completely determined by
two quantities, namely by a scalar n(r, t), which is pro-
portional to concentration of conservative particles of a
deﬁnite sort, and by a vector j(r, t), the corresponding
density of ﬂow. The ﬁeld j is related by the continuity
equation to the ﬁeld n,

nt + div j = 0,

(1)

where subscript is used to denote the partial derivative.
It is clear that j = nv, where v(r, t) is the macro-
scopic velocity ﬁeld. Let each point of the ﬂuid medium
be marked by a label a = (a1, a2, a3), so the mapping
r = x(a, t) is the full Lagrangian description of the ﬂow.
The less exhaustive description of the ﬂow by the ﬁelds
n(r, t) and j(r, t) is commonly referred as the Eulerian
description. The relations between the Eulerian ﬁelds
and the Lagrangian mapping are the following,

n(r, t) =

δ(r

x(a, t))da,

(2)

−

Z

j(r, t) =

δ(r

x(a, t))xt(a, t)da,

(3)

and they satisfy the continuity equation (1) automati-
cally.

With neglecting all dissipative processes (due to vis-
cosity, diﬀusion, etc.), and assuming internal properties
of the ﬂuid homogeneous (such as the speciﬁc entropy in
adiabatic ﬂows, or the temperature in isothermal ﬂows),
the trajectories r = x(a, t) of ﬂuid elements are deter-

III. PARTICULAR EXAMPLES

To emphasize universality of the employed approach,
now we are going to consider several physically interest-
ing examples.

A. Eulerian hydrodynamics

Let us start with the usual Eulerian hydrodynamics. In
this simple case n is the density of the ﬂuid, and the La-
grangian is the diﬀerence between the total macroscopic
kinetic energy and the total potential energy including
the thermal internal energy,

B. Relativistic ﬂuid dynamics

In the Special Relativity (with c = 1 for simplicity) the
ﬁeld n is the time component of the (contra-variant) 4-
vector of current, while j is the space component [8]. The
absolute value ˜n of this 4-vector is equal to (n2
)1/2
and it has the meaning of the concentration of conserva-
tive particles in the locally co-moving frame of reference.

depends in a complicated manner on n, j, gik. This cir-
cumstance makes impossible in general case to present an
analytical expression for the corresponding Hamiltonian
functional, but, of course, it cannot cancel the existence
of the Hamiltonian in mathematical sense.

3

Analogously multi-component hydrodynamical models
can be investigated where several ﬁelds na and ja are
present corresponding to diﬀerent sorts of particles, with
a = 1, 2, . . . , A. The Hamiltonian non-canonical equa-
tions of motion for such models have the same general
structure as discussed above, and they should be writ-
ten for each component. Below we consider a physically
important example — the two-ﬂuid plasma model. As
special limit cases, this model contains the usual mag-
netohydrodynamics (MHD), the Electron MHD, and the
Hall MHD.

1. Lagrangian formalism

As the start point in investigation the two-ﬂuid plasma
model, let us consider the microscopic Lagrangian of a
system of electrically charged classical point particles, as
it is given in the famous book by Landau and Lifshitz [1].
This Lagrangian is approximately valid up to the second
order on v/c since excitation of the free electro-magnetic
ﬁeld by moving charges is negligible,

The ﬁrst double sum in Eq.(13) corresponds to the
electrostatic interaction, while the second double sum
describes the magnetic interaction via quasi-stationary
magnetic ﬁeld.
It is very important that for a system
with macroscopically huge number of particles the mag-
netic energy can be of the same order (or even larger)
as the macroscopic kinetic energy produced by the ﬁrst
ordinary sum in Eq.(13), while the terms of the fourth
order on the velocities are often negligible. Generally
speaking, a large part of plasma physics is governed by
this Lagrangian, at least in the cases when the veloci-
ties of particles are non-relativistic and the free electro-
magnetic ﬁeld is not excited signiﬁcantly. Obviously,
diﬀerent physical problems need diﬀerent procedures of
macroscopic consideration of this system. The most ac-
curate (and the most complicated) would be a kinetic
description. However, for our purposes it is suﬃcient to
apply more simple and naive procedure of the hydrody-
namical averaging, that gives less accurate description of
the system in terms of the concentration n(r, t) of elec-
trons and the density j(r, t) of their ﬂow, that satisfy

the continuity equation, nt + div j = 0 (and correspond-
ing ﬁelds N (r, t), J (r, t) for the ions, normalized to one
elementary electric charge e, so N = ZNi.)

Neglecting all dissipative processes that take place due
to collisions of the particles (though on this step we
strongly reduce applicability of the following conserva-
tive two-ﬂuid plasma model), we derive from Eq.(13) the
following Lagrangian functional

tions of motion to contain the pressure terms like
(see the last term in Eq.(5)), where p
nTe is the pres-
sure of the hot electron gas, which is supposed to be
isothermal with a temperature Te. The functions f (Te)
and F (Ti) actually are not important since they do not
contribute to the equations of motion and thus will be
omitted in further equations.

It should be kept in mind that densities of the internal
energy should be used instead of densities of the free en-
ergy if we suppose the ﬂows to be isentropic. However,
since the thermal conductivity is large at high temper-
/e4m1/2, [10]), the isothermal approxi-
atures (κ

The equations of motion for the electron component
now have the non-canonical Hamiltonian structure (8-9)
(and analogous equations for the ion component). Due to
the large coeﬃcient

INTERACTION BETWEEN FROZEN-IN

VORTEX LINES AND ACOUSTIC MODES.

The Hamiltonian non-canonical equations (8-9) do not
follow directly from a variational principle. The math-
ematical reason for this is a degeneracy of the corre-
sponding non-canonical Poisson bracket (10) which is
discussed, for instance, in [2]. The degeneracy results
in frozen-in property for the canonical vorticity ﬁeld
ω = curl p. However, representations of the canonical
momentum in terms of auxiliary variables exist that ﬁx
topological structure of vortex lines, and then a varia-
tional formulation becomes possible. A known exam-
ple of such auxiliary variables are the Clebsch variables
[2, 11], when p = ∇ϕ + (λ/n)∇µ and (n, ϕ), (λ, µ) are
two pairs of canonically conjugate variables. But the
Clebsch representation usually is not suitable for study-
ing localized vortex structures like vortex ﬁlaments. Be-
low we consider another representation for the canoni-
cal momentum ﬁeld, when dynamical variables are the

5

≈

shapes of vortex lines. For a nearly static density proﬁle,
n0(r), such description was used in [4, 5] to study
n
slow ﬂows in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Now we
are going to introduce a variational formulation valid for
the general case, since the function n(r, t) is also an un-
known variable. It will be demonstrated that variational
principle with the Lagrangian (41) determines equations
of motion for shapes of frozen-in vortex lines, for the po-
tential component of the canonical momentum ﬁeld, and
for the density proﬁle n(r, t).

(26)

So, we decompose the momentum ﬁeld onto the poten-

tial component and the divergence-free component,

p(r, t) = ∇ϕ(r, t) + curl−1ω(r, t).

(32)

Accordingly, the ﬁeld j is decomposed,

variational principle deﬁnitely can serve as a basis for fu-
ture approximate analytical and numerical studies deal-
ing with reduced dynamical systems where only most rel-
evant degrees of freedom will be taken into account.

The function Ψ(ν1, ν2) can be useful to investigate
nearly stationary ﬂows, since the eﬀective Hamiltonian,

has an extremum on stationary ﬂows with the velocity
ﬁeld v everywhere directed along vortex surfaces. How-
ever, one should remember that existence of globally de-
ﬁned vortex surfaces (and thus the function Ψ) is an ex-
ceptional case in the variety of 3D vector ﬁelds. In the
∇a)R(a, t)da in-
general case one should use (ω0(a)
stead of Rξ(ν, ξ, t)d2νdξ in the Lagrangian (41) and no
function Ψ(ν1, ν2), since the labels ν are not deﬁned.

Generalization of the above theory for multi-ﬂuid mod-

els is straightforward.

A. The case of the Hall MHD

In the Hall MHD there are two frozen-in generalized
vorticity ﬁelds but only one density ﬁeld.
It is easy
to check that in this case the corresponding Lagrangian
takes the following form,

Thus, the Lagrangian (41) gives a required variational
formulation for the problem of motion and interaction
between localized frozen-in vortex structures (described
by the mapping R(ν, ξ, t)) and acoustic degrees of free-
dom (described by the ﬁelds n(r, t) and ϕ(r, t)). This

where the vector function R(ν, ξ, t) describes the frozen-
in lines of the electron generalized vorticity ω, while
X(µ, η, t) describes the frozen-in lines of the ion general-
ized vorticity Ω. The Hamiltonian
is given
by Eq.(20).

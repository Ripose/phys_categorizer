Abstract: Based on the ordering and competition of
length scales in complex multi-scale systems, it is shown
how clustering of active quantities into concentrated sets,
like bubbles in a Swiss cheese, is a generic property that
dominates the intermittent structure. The halo-like surfaces
of these clusters have scaling exponents lower than that of
their kernels, which can be as high as the domain dimension.
Examples, among others, are spots in ﬂuid turbulence and
droplets in spin-glasses. (pnas2a.tex 04/01/05)

It has long been recognized that active quantities in
complex systems of many types are not distributed
evenly across a domain but cluster strongly into irreg-
ular bubbles, as in a Swiss cheese. The nomenclature,
the nature and shape of the bubbles, and the physics in
each subject is substantially diﬀerent: spottiness in high
Reynolds number ﬂuid turbulence [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7]
and boundary layers [8]; droplet formation in spin-
glasses [9, 10, 11]; clustering behaviour in networks
[12, 13]; the preferential concentration of inertial parti-
cles [14, 15, 16] with applications to rain initiation by
cloud turbulence [17]; and magnetic bubbles in astro-
physics [18], are just a few examples. These clustered
sets display strong features whose typical length scales
are much shorter than the average, thus raising the
question of the nature of the interface between them
and their surrounding longer scale regions. For instance,
in spin glasses the ‘surface’ of the droplets has a fractal-
like structure whereas the droplets themselves take the
full domain dimension [11]. In ﬂuid turbulence the con-
centrated sets on which vorticity and strain accumulate
are tubes and sheets, although the precise fractal na-
ture of these is unclear. These sets dominate the associ-
ated Fourier spectra which display a spikiness that is the

hallmark of what is usually referred to as intermittency
[6, 1, 2, 3]. The ubiquity of this irregular bubble-like
topology suggests that a set universal organizing prin-
ciples lie behind its occurrence in complex multi-scale
systems. The purpose of this paper is to show that
this is indeed the case and that the interface between
these clusters and their surrounding region is crucially
important.

Consider a d-dimensional system whose smallest char-
acteristic (integral) scale L is such that the system is
statistically homogeneous on boxes Ω = [0, L]d. More-
over, it is endowed with the following two properties.
Firstly, at each point x ∈ Ω, it possesses an ordered set
of length scales ℓn = ℓn(x) associated with a hierarchy
of features labelled by n ≥ 2

L > ℓ1 ≥ ℓ2 ≥ . . . ≥ ℓn ≥ ℓn+1 . . .

(1)

The ℓn could be thought of as an ordered set of correla-
tion or coherence lengths; their inverses κn(x) = ℓ−1
n (x)
clearly obey 1 < Lκn ≤ Lκn+1. The second assump-
tion is that the ensemble averages of the Lκn(x) are
bounded above by some ordered, positive parameters of
the system satisfying 1 < Rn ≤ Rn+1

1 < L hκni ≤ Rn

(2)

The ensemble average h·i is a spatial average with re-
spect to the Lebesgue measure over Ω. Thus, while the
ordering of the ℓn(x) must be respected at each point,
the ℓn themselves could be quite rough; e.g. they could
consist of a series of step functions. If they become very
small near points x∗ then they must obey ℓn > O(rd−ε)
(r = |x − x∗| and ε > 0) so as not to violate (2).

Now we turn to a technical idea ﬁrst used in ref. [19]:
consider two, real arbitrary parameters; 0 < µ < 1 and
0 < α < 1 such that µ + α = 1. Their inverses µ−1

and α−1 are used as exponents in the H¨older inequality

positive, designated as good regions, and negative (<)

side of (6) remarkably contains the arbitrary parameter
µ which lies in the range 0 < µ < 1. Its existence is im-
portant because the ordering in (1) makes it clear from
(6) that everywhere within the bad regions (<) there

It is clear
from (5) that the existence and location of the clusters

all clusters for every n would be the union A+ = ∪A+

With such sparse information it is diﬃcult to estimate
the Hausdorﬀ or the fractal dimensions of A+

still possible to estimate scaling exponents [20]. This
entails making a third assumption of self-similarity to

(10)

for some large enough p > 1, it is clear that k+
n cannot
be large enough when p = 1 because of (2). However,
any value of p ≫ 1 will do that makes k+

to be a member of A+

Instead of using (9) to estimate m(A+

of self-similar scaling is introduced that requires that the

We observe that the deﬁnition of the set A+

L, λ+

The grey halo clearly plays the role of an interface
of small but ﬁnite thickness between the d-dimensional
(white) outer region and the (black) inner kernel whose
dimension can be as high as d but could be less. When
D+

n,ker saturates its upper bound we have

D+

n,halo ≤ d(1 − µ) < D+

n,ker = d

(19)

The results in (19) are similar to those in the droplet
theory of spin glasses where the kernel of the droplet
is of full dimension d but its surrounding ‘surface’ has
a scaling exponent > d − 1. Palassini and Young [11]
have shown numerically that D+
n,halo = 2.58±0.02 when
halo = 2.77 ± 0.02 when d = 4. For D+
d = 3 and D+
halo
to satisfy D+
halo > d − 1, µ would have to lie in the
range 0 < µ ≤ 1/d for the grey interface to be at least
a surface but the exponent may be signiﬁcantly lower if
µ is allowed values nearer unity.

This work has been based on the idea that in a system
with many (≥ 2) ordered correlation lengths in a statis-
tically homogeneous region Ω, the competition between
them provokes an eﬀect in which length scales smaller

or spottiness came more than half a century ago from
Batchelor and Townsend [1] who observed intermittent
behaviour in their high Reynolds number ﬂow experi-
ments, closely followed by observations in boundary lay-
ers by Emmons [8]. Batchelor and Townsend suggested
that the energy associated with the small scale compo-
nents is distributed unevenly in space and roughly con-
ﬁned to regions which concomitantly become smaller
with eddy size (see also ref.
[21]). Mandelbrot then
suggested that these clustered sets on which the en-
ergy dissipation is the greatest might be fractal in na-

dissipation rate in several laboratory ﬂows, and in the
atmospheric surface layer, Meneveau and Sreenivasan
interpreted the intermittent nature of their signals in
terms of multi-fractals [2]. Recent experiments measur-
ing intense rotation and dissipation in turbulent ﬂows
have been made by Zeﬀ et al [3].

In contrast to biological problems or spin glass states,
the rapid time evolution of sets of high vorticity or strain
in ﬂuid turbulence is an important issue; many computa-
tions exist showing how these sets take on the nature of
quasi-one-dimensional tubes and quasi-two-dimensional
sheets which have short lifetimes [7]. An alternative to
studying the problem in a statistical manner is to in-
clude time in the ensemble average h·i, in which case
the semi-inﬁnite nature of the time-axis suggests a dif-
ferent measure might be necessary4. With speciﬁc ref-
erence to the Navier-Stokes equations, analysis is not
advanced enough to deal with the full space-time equa-
tions (except see ref.
[23]); conventional methods of
analysis use Sobolev norms to L2-average over space
and remove the pressure [24, 25, 4] leaving only time
as the independent variable.
[19] a set of or-
dered κn have been constructed which are comprised of
ratios of norms (of derivatives of order n) and there-
fore functions of time only; thus the clusters of Figure
1 are merely gaps or bad intervals of the time-axis.
It
is then necessary to prove that they are ﬁnite in width
and decreasing with increasing Reynolds number which
involves ﬁnding upper and lower bounds on µ.

Without equations of motion, however, a numerical
experiment would be necessary to estimate the Rn by

nels, although if the κn take very large values within the
black kernels it might not be possible to achieve resolu-
tion. The upper bound D+
n,halo ≤ d(1 − µ) is apparently
uniform in n although it possible that upper and lower
bounds exist on µ that are themselves n-dependent, as
in ref. [19].

These ideas are applicable,

in d-
dimensions even though most physical examples un-
dergo dramatic changes in behaviour as d is varied; for
instance, spin glasses behave very diﬀerently in diﬀerent
dimensions [11] as do solutions of the two-dimensional
and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. An in-
teresting idea is that of West, Brown and Enquist
[13] who have suggested that the biological hierarchi-
cal branching networks that terminate in size-invariant
units (e.g. capillaries) are actually a product of them
operating as if d = 4 (despite living in a space of Eu-
clidean dimension 3) thus giving rise to the well known
quarter-power scaling law of biology.

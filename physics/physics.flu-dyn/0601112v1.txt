We prove here that the short waves in shear ﬂows are always stable, whereas the shear ﬂow
instability is due to long wave instability. For the unstable ﬂows, an estimation of growth rate
is obtained as ωi
, which is much better than former one obtained by
|
Høiland and Howard. It implies that the shear ﬂow itself can damp the short waves without viscous
eﬀect. Contrast this with short wave instability in Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. Further
investigation shows that K-H instability is in essence of long-wave instability in shear ﬂow. These
results can be applied to verify numerical calculations.

Shear instability, caused by the velocity shear, is one
of most important instabilities in the ﬂows. It is applied
to explain the instability of mixing layer, jets in pipe,
wakes behind cylinder, et al. The most simple exam-
ple is Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability, in which the
piecewise constant ﬂow is considered. It is known that
the growth rate of the disturbance wave is proportion to
the product of wavenumber and velocity shear, i.e. the
short waves are more instable than long waves. Then,
Rayleigh [1] investigated the stability of an piecewise lin-
ear proﬁle. He found that the proﬁle is linearly unstable
only in a ﬁnite range of wavenumbers 0 < k < kc, which
means the short waves are stable in this case [1, 2, 3, 4].
Thus, a paradox emerges, for these two simple models
show contradiction results in growth rate. To dispel the
paradox, two essential problems need to understand for
shear instability.

The ﬁrst one is which kind of wave dominate the shear
instability, long wave or short wave? It is from the numer-
ical simulation (see [2, 4, 7] and references therein) and
some theoretical analysis [8, 9] that long wave might be
more unstable than short wave. For example, a more gen-
eral model, covering Rayleigh’s case, was also obtained
by Tollmien [8] and Lin [9]. They proved similar result
subject to the velocity proﬁle U (y) is either symmetric
or monotone. We will investigate this problem following
the way by Sun [10, 11].

The second one is can we estimate the growth rate of
unstable waves prior to numerical calculation? It is as-
sociate to the unstable velocity proﬁle. If there is a prior
estimation of growth rate, such as Howard’s semicircle
theorem [12], then it is helpful for both theoretical inves-
tigations and numerical calculations. Høiland [13] and
Howard [12] found an estimation for growth rate that
the growth rate must less equate to half of the maxim of
vorticity, i.e., ωi
max/2. But this estimation is too
|
cursory to use in applications. For example, U ′ is always
great than zero even the velocity proﬁle has no inﬂec-

tion point. So this estimation is trivial for these cases.
Here we will show a reﬁnement estimation of growth rate,
which can be applied to general velocity proﬁles in par-
allel ﬂows.

The motivation of this short letter is to investigate
these problems within the context of inviscid parallel
ﬂow. Our aim here is to ﬁnd some general characters
for unstable waves.

To this purpose, the ﬁrst part of this paper is to prove
long-wave instabilities in shear ﬂows. So Rayleigh equa-
tion is employed. For a parallel ﬂow with mean velocity
U (y), the streamfunction of the disturbance expands as
series of waves (normal modes) with real wavenumber k
and complex frequency ω = ωr + iωi, where ωi relates
to the grow rate of the waves. The ﬂow is unstable if
and only if ωi > 0. We study the stability of the dis-
turbances by investigating the growth rate of the waves,
this method is known as normal mode method. The am-
plitude of waves, namely φ, holds

where c = ω/k = cr + ici is the complex phase speed.
The real part of complex phase speed cr = ωr/k is the
wave phase speed. This equation is to be solved subject
to homogeneous boundary conditions

φ = 0 at y = a, b.

There are three main categories boundaries: (i) enclosed
channels for both a and b being ﬁnite, (ii) boundary layer
for either a or b being inﬁnity, and (iii) free shear ﬂows
for both a and b being inﬁnity.

From Rayleigh’s equation, we get the following equa-

where the eigenvalue µ is positive deﬁnition for φ

The smallest eigenvalue value, namely µ1, can be es-

to k2

steps. At ﬁrst, we prove result 1: if cr = Us, the distur-
bances with short waves k > kc are always stable.

ﬂows must be long wave instability. This is very gen-
eral and important conclusion, which explains why the
instabilities found in shear ﬂows are mostly long wave
instabilities.

The fact of long-wave instability in shear ﬂows may be
applied to understand the phenomena in hydrodynam-
ics. For example, the long-wave instability means that
the long waves can obtain the energy from background
ﬂows. And the energy will concentrate on the long waves,
so that the large structures come into being. This might
relate to the vortex pairing in shear instability, in which
the small structures tend to become large structures as
time being. Furthermore, the short-wave stability means
that without any viscous eﬀect, the short waves can also
be damped by shear ﬂow. This mechanism is unlike the
viscous mechanism that the viscosity has a damping ef-
fect on especially the short waves.
It implies that the
shear ﬂow itself can damp the short waves.

This result is also very important for numerical cal-
culation, which means short waves can be truncated in
the calculations without changes the stability of shear
ﬂow. So the growth rates of long waves have enough in-
formation for judging the stability of shear ﬂow. On the
other hand, the truncation of long waves would probably
change the instability of the shear ﬂow. So the stream-
wise length scale must be longer enough to have long
waves for the numerical simulations in shear ﬂows, such
as plane parallel ﬂow and pipe ﬂow. Otherwise the insta-
bility of shear ﬂow would be damped without long-wave
perturbations.

The second part of the paper is the estimation of
f (y) <

which also contradicts Eq.(8). So the second result is also
proved. These two results are natural generalization of
stabile criterion proved by Sun [10, 11].

From the above two results, we can draw a conclusion
that the disturbances with short waves k > kc are al-
ways stable. This means that the instabilities in shear

So the result is proved. One should note that the fast
growth rate ωi is only an approximation, but not a pre-
cision one, so as to wavenumber kmax.

As known that Howrad’s theory shows a estimation for
the complex velocity ci. Similar to his theory, our work
shows a estimation for both the wavenumber and the
growth rate of disturbed waves. This estimation is more
powerful than the one by Høiland and Howard in case of
neutrally stable ﬂow, and is also helpful for validation in
numerical calculations.

The instability due to velocity shear is always associ-
ated to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (K-H instability), in
which the disturbances of all wavelengths are ampliﬁed.
According to K-H instability, the shorter the wavelength
is, the faster the perturbation wave ampliﬁes. Then the
short waves are always more unstable than long waves in
this case. So it seems that the long wave is more unstable

3

than short wave in the shear ﬂow. So there is a paradox
between K-H instability and Rayleigh’s case.

≪

An physical explanation to the paradox is that the K-
H instability model has no intrinsic length scale [2, 4].
While Rayleigh’s model has width of shear layer as length
scale of waves. And it is also noted that Rayleigh’s case
reduces to the Kelvein-Helmholtz vortex sheet result in
the long wave limit k
1 [2, 4]. It is another evidence
that K-H instability is in essence of long-wave instability.
This is dramatically explained as long wave do not ”feel”
the ﬁnite thickness of the shear layer [4]. Here we will
show that this explanation can be extend to shear ﬂows.
It is from Eq.(21) that the fastest growing wavenumber
kmax is proportion to √µ1, then the corresponding wave
length λmax is approximately 2(b
1. So the
thinner the shear layer is, the lager the fastest growing
wavenumber is. It can be seen that the asymptotic case
of inﬁnite small shear layer leads to K-H instability. In
this case, the K-H instability is an approximation of shear
instability when the wave length of perturbation is much
longer than the width of shear layer.

In summery, the properties of shear instability are in-
vestigated. We ﬁnd ﬁrst that the short waves are always
stable in the ﬂows and that the shear instability is due
to long-wave instability.
It implies that the shear ﬂow
itself can damp the short waves and that K-H instability
is in essence of long-wave instability in shear ﬂow. This
result can be used to understand the phenomena in hy-
drodynamics instabilities. The second result we obtained
is that the growth rate of unstable ﬂow can be estimated
as ωi
Umin). This estimation extend

the former result obtained by Høiland and Howard.

Both results are important in numerical applica-
tions. The ﬁrst one provides the estimation of unstable
wavenumbers, and the second one provides the estima-

light on both numerical calculation and stability analysis.

Abstract

Recently there has been some progress in modeling the statistical properties of turbulent ﬂows
using simple superstatistical models. Here we brieﬂy review the concept of superstatistics in
turbulence. In particular, we discuss a superstatistical extension of the Sawford model and
compare with experimental data.

Turbulence is a spatio-temporal chaotic dynamics generated by the Navier-Stokes equation

˙~v =

)~v + ν∆~v + ~F .

In the past 5 years there has been some experimental progress in Lagrangian turbulence mea-
surements, i.e. tracking single tracer particles in the turbulent ﬂow. Due to the measurements
of the Bodenschatz [1, 2, 3] and Pinton groups [4, 5] we now have a better view of what the
statistics of a single test particle in a turbulent ﬂow looks like. The recent measurements have
shown that the acceleration ~a as well as velocity diﬀerence ~u = ~v(t + τ )
~v(t) on short time
scales τ exhibits strongly non-Gaussian behavior. This is true for both, single components as
well as the absolute value of ~a and ~u. Moreover, there are correlations between the various
components of ~a, as well as between velocity and acceleration. The corresponding joint prob-
abilities do not factorize. Finally, the correlation functions of the absolute value

How can we understand all this by simple stochastic models? There is a recent class of
models that are pretty successful in explaining all these statistical properties of Lagrangian
turbulence (as well as of other turbulent systems, such as Eulerian turbulence [6, 7, 8], atmo-
spheric turbulence [9, 10, 11] and defect turbulence [12]). These are turbulence models based
on superstatistics [13]. Superstatistics is a concept from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics,
in short it means a ‘statistics of statistics’, one given by ordinary Boltzmann factors and an-
other one given by ﬂuctuations of an intensive parameter, e.g. the inverse temperature, or the
energy dissipation, or a local variance. While the idea of ﬂuctuating intensive parameters is
certainly not new, it is the application to spatio-temporally chaotic systems such as turbulent
ﬂow that makes the concept interesting. The ﬁrst turbulence model of this kind was intro-
duced in [14], in the meantime the idea has been further reﬁned and extended [15, 16, 3, 8].
The basic idea is to generate a superposition of two statistics, in short a ‘superstatistics’,
by stochastic diﬀerential equations whose parameters ﬂuctuate on a relatively large spatio-
temporal scale. In Lagrangian turbulence, this large time scale can be understood by the fact
that the particle is trapped in vortex tubes for quite a while [3]. Superstatistical turbulence
models reproduce all the experimental data quite well. An example is shown in Fig. 1. The

and only one ﬁtting parameter, s2 = 3.0. A similar formula as eq. (2) was
with µ = e
already considered in [17], though without a dynamical interpretation in terms of a stochastic
diﬀerential equation with ﬂuctuating parameters.

The key ingredient of superstatistical models is to start from a known model generating
Gaussian behaviour, and extend it to a superstatistical version exhibiting ‘fat tails’.
In

term density

where f (β) is some suitable probability density of a ﬂuctuating parameter β. The function
f (β) ﬁxes the type of superstatistics under consideration. In particular, it is responsible for
the shape of the tails [18]. Note the mixing of two statistics, that of a and that of β.

In Lagrangian turbulence, one may ﬁrst start from a Gaussian turbulence model, the
Sawford model [19, 20]. This model considers the joint stochastic process (a(t), v(t), x(t)) of
an arbitrary component of acceleration, velocity and position of a Lagrangian test particle,
and assumes that they obey the stochastic diﬀerential equation

, which is a good approximation
For our purposes it is suﬃcient to consider the limit TL → ∞
for large Reynolds numbers. In that limit the Sawford model reduces to just a linear Langevin
equation

Note that this is a Langevin equation for the acceleration, not for the velocity, in marked
contrast to ordinary Brownian motion.

Unfortunately, the Sawford model predicts Gaussian stationary distributions for a, and is

thus at variance with the recent measurements. So how can we save this model?

As said before, the idea is to generalize the Sawford model with constant parameters to
a superstatistical version. To construct a superstatistical extension of Sawford model, we
replace in the above equations the constant energy dissipation ¯ǫ by a ﬂuctuating one. One
formally deﬁnes a variance parameter [16]

where ǫ ﬂuctuates. Now, if β varies on a large spatio-temporal scale, and is distributed with
the distribution f (β), one ends up with eq. (3) describing the long-term marginal distribution
of the superstatistical dynamics (7). This is basically the type of model introduced in [14],
there with f (β) chosen to be a χ2-distribution. Models based on χ2-superstatistics yield good
results for atmospheric turbulence [9, 10], and ultimately lead to Tsallis statistics [21]. On
the other hand, for laboratory turbulence experiments one usually obtains better agreement
with experimental data if f (β) is a lognormal distribution. In view of eq. (10) this is clearly
motivated by Kolmogorov’s ideas of a lognormally distributed ǫ [22].

Superstatistical models are not restricted to Lagrangian turbulence but can be also for-
mulated for Eulerian turbulence [7, 14]. Fig. 2 shows that also here one obtains excellent
agreement with experimental data: Probability densities p(u) of longitudinal velocity diﬀer-
ences u are well ﬁtted by lognormal superstatistics on all scales. The parameter s2 varies
with the scale.
In fact, not only the distribution p(u) but also the distribution f (β) can
be directly measured in experiments [8], and the two can be consistently connected via the
superstatistics formalism. Jung and Swinney [8] have also experimentally conﬁrmed a simple
scaling relation between β and the ﬂuctuating energy dissipation ǫ.

It should be noted that if we know the probability densities p(u) analytically, as well as
the dependence of the parameter s2 on the scale r, we can also calculate moments of velocity
diﬀerences and thus determine scaling exponents ζm deﬁned by

i ∼
Many diﬀerent models of ζm can be constructed in such a way [16, 23, 24]. For further
stochastic models, see e.g. [25, 26, 27].

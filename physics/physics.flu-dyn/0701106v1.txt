Abstract

Rotation and shear ﬂows are an ubiquitous features of many astro-
physical and geophysical bodies, playing a crucial role in turbulent trans-
port. To understand the complex dynamics in these systems, we provide
a consistent theory of turbulence in the presence of shear and rotation.
Starting from a quasi-linear equation for the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds, we derive
turbulence amplitude and turbulent transport coeﬃcients (turbulent vis-
cosity and diﬀusivity), taking into account the eﬀect of shear and rotation
on turbulence. We focus on the two cases where the rotation is perpendic-
ular and parallel to the plane of the shear ﬂow. We show that the shear
reduces both turbulence amplitude and transport, more strongly in the
direction parallel to the shear than in the perpendicular one, eﬀectively
inducing an anisotropic turbulence. The rotation further reduces turbu-
lence amplitude and transport when it is perpendicular to the shear but
does not have much eﬀect when it is parallel to the shear. The interaction
between the shear and the rotation is shown to give rise to a novel non-
diﬀusive ﬂux of angular momentum (Λ-eﬀect), providing a mechanism
for the permanence of shearing structure in astrophysical and geophysical
systems. Eddy viscosity tends to become negative for fast rotation and
strong shear. Anisotropic transport reduction is also found in turbulent
mixing of passive scalars, largely due to shear ﬂow.

Introduction

Rotating turbulent ﬂows can be found in many areas such as engineering (turbo-
machinery, combustion engine), geophysics (oceans, Earth’s atmosphere) or as-
trophysics (gaseous planets, galactic and accretion disks). large-scale ﬂuid mo-
tions tends to appear as a robust feature in these systems, often in the form of
shear ﬂows (such as circulations on the surface of planets, diﬀerential rotation
in stars and galaxies or ﬂows in a rotating machinery), which in turn plays a
crucial role in determining turbulence properties and transport, such as energy
transfer or mixing (Kim, 2005). The understanding of the complex interaction
among rotation, large-scale shear ﬂows and turbulence thus lies in the heart of
the predictive theory of turbulent transport in many systems.

The case of the plane shear ﬂow in a rotating frame has been studied by
many authors focusing on its stability both in the laminar and the turbulent

stratiﬁcation [supported by calculation of Pedley (1969)] and showed that the

the rotation and suﬃciently strong. Precisely, the ratio ¯Ω = 2 ˜Ω/
must lie in
the interval [0 , 1] for instability. This destabilisation of laminar shear ﬂow by
rotation has a counterpart for turbulent ﬂows where the rotation can stabilise
turbulence (by decreasing its kinetic energy) or destabilise it. Theoretically
Tritton (1992), by using a displacement argument, and Yanase et al. (1993), by
using stability analysis conﬁrmed by simulations (Metais et al., 1995), reach the
following conclusion: the cyclonic shear ( ¯Ω < 0) is always stabilising whereas
the anticyclonic shear ( ¯Ω > 0) is destabilising for weak rotation while stabilising
for high rotation, in agreement with Bradshaw criterion. These conclusions are
conﬁrmed for a Poiseuille ﬂow, both experimentally (Johnston et al., 1972) and
numerically (Kristoﬀersen & Andersson, 1993), and for a plane Couette ﬂow
(Bech & Andersson, 1996, 1997). In comparison, the case where the rotation
lies in the same plane as the ﬂow has been much less studied. From the stability
point of view, one could argue (e.g., Cambon et al., 1994; Leblanc & Cambon,
1997; Sipp & Jacquin, 2000) that as the projection of the vorticity on the ro-
tation axis vanishes in this case (for a linear shear), the system may be stable
regardless of the values of the rotation rate or shear.

Provided that a large-scale shear ﬂow is stable, this ﬂow and rotation have a
crucial inﬂuence on the regulation of turbulent transport. The Taylor-Proudman
theorem (Proudman, 1916; Taylor, 1921) states that for suﬃciently strong ro-
tation, the motion becomes independent of the coordinate along the rotation
axis (in the linear inviscid regime). However, this linear theory does not permit
to study the transition from three dimensional to two-dimensional structures as
rotation increases. In fact, Cambon et al. (1997) have shown that the turbu-
lence energy concentrates in the plane normal to the rotation axis due to non
linear interactions. This could explain why a linear theory such as the rapid
distortion theory (RDT) cannot capture the transition from three-dimensional
to two-dimensional structures. Later, this result has been conﬁrmed by the
numerical simulations by Smith & Waleﬀe (1999), who showed that the large-
scale energy lies mainly in two-dimensional modes due to non-linear interactions
between inertial waves. However, they also showed that the inverse cascade of
energy was mainly caused by non-local interactions between the large and small
scale velocity ﬁelds. According to these results, a linear theory such as RDT
should be able to capture the inverse cascade, if not the transition to two di-
mensions. This will be shown later in this paper.

In rotating turbulence, the inverse cascade can occur not only due to a (dif-
fusive) negative viscosity, but also due to non-diﬀusive momentum transport.
The latter is known as the anisotropic kinetic α-eﬀect (AKA) (Frisch et al.,
1987) or as the Λ-eﬀect in the astrophysical community. The appearance of
non-diﬀusive term in the transport of angular momentum prevents a solid body
rotation from being a solution of the Reynolds equation (Lebedinsky, 1941;
Kippenhahn, 1963), and thus act as a source for the generation of large-scale
shear ﬂows. For instance, this eﬀect has been advocated as a robust mecha-
nism to explain the diﬀerential rotation in the solar convective zone. Starting
from Navier-Stokes equation, it is possible to show that these ﬂuxes arise when
there is a cause of anisotropy in the system, either due to an anisotropic back-
ground turbulence (see R¨udiger, 1989, and references therein) or else due to

2

inhomogeneities such as an underlying stratiﬁcation (Kichatinov, 1987).

Another important problem, which have received much less attention, is
the eﬀect of rotation and shear on the mixing and transport of scalars (such
as pollutants, heat or reacting species). For instance, observations show that
the concentration of light elements at the surface of the Sun is smaller than
what is expected by comparison with Earth’s or meteorites abundance. As
these light elements can only be destroyed below the strong shearing region
(the tachocline), it is crucial to understand the transport properties of scalars
in a rotating sheared layer. Note that studies of passive scalar transport in non-
rotating sheared turbulence (Tavoularis & Corrsin, 1981; Rogers et al., 1989)
have shown a strong misalignment between the scalar ﬂux and the mean gra-
dient. Thus, gradient-diﬀusion models are not very appropriate to study the
evolution of a large-scale scalar gradient. In comparison, in rotating turbulence,
Brethouwer (2005) found that numerical simulation results agree fairly well with
linear theory and showed that the scalar ﬂux vector aligned itself in the direction
of strongest velocity ﬂuctuation.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the eﬀect of rotation and
shear ﬂow on the turbulence properties and transport. In our previous works, we
have studied the turbulent transport by taking into account the crucial eﬀect of
shearing, the so-called shear stabilisation, due to a strong radial diﬀerential rota-
tion (Kim, 2005; Leprovost & Kim, 2006) and also by incorporating the interac-
tion of this sheared turbulence with diﬀerent types of waves that can be excited
due to magnetic ﬁelds (Kim & Dubrulle, 2001; Kim, 2006; Leprovost & Kim,
2007) or stratiﬁcation (Kim & Leprovost, 2006). Here, we study a (local) Carte-
sian model concentrating on the two cases where the shear direction and the
rotation are perpendicular or parallel to each other. We consider a turbu-
lence driven by an external forcing and perform a quasi-linear analysis to derive
the dependence of turbulence amplitude and transport on rotation and shear.
Compared to two-dimensional turbulence studied in Leprovost & Kim (2007),
the (average) rotation supports the propagation of inertial waves in three di-
mensions, which interact with a shear ﬂow, playing an important role in the
overall turbulent transport. In particular, we show that the momentum trans-
port is not only due to eddy-viscosity but also to non-diﬀusive Λ-eﬀect. Non
trivial Λ-eﬀect can result from an anisotropy induced by shear ﬂow on the tur-
bulence even when the driving force is isotropic, in contrast to the case without
shear ﬂow where this eﬀect exists only for anisotropic turbulence (Kichatinov,
1987). Furthermore, the eddy-viscosity can change its sign depending on the
relative strength of rotation, shear and dissipation. We also examine the eﬀect
of rotation on the stability of shear ﬂows.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows:

is chosen to lie in the plane y = 0 and to make an angle θ with the z direction.
Following Kim (2005), we study the eﬀect of a large-scale shear U0 = U0(x)ˆj
on the transport properties of turbulence by writing the velocity as a sum of a
shear (chosen in the x-direction) and ﬂuctuations: u = U0 + v = U0(x)ˆj + v =

To calculate the turbulence amplitude (or kinetic energy growth) and the
turbulent viscosity, we need to solve the equation for the ﬂuctuating velocity
ﬁeld. We resort to the quasi-linear approximation (Moﬀatt, 1978) where the
product of ﬂuctuations is neglected to obtain the following equations for the
evolution of the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld:

where p and f are respectively the small-scale components of the pressure and
forcing. This approximation, also-known as rapid distortion theory (Townsend,
1976) is strictly valid only for two scale turbulence, with a spatial gap between
a large-scale for the shear and a small scale for the ﬂuctuating velocity, and for
weak turbulence. However, it is likely to be valid in our case as the large-scale
shear induces a weak turbulence, leading to weak interaction between small
scales which is negligible compared to the (non-local) interaction between the
shear and the small scales. This has in fact been conﬁrmed by direct numerical
simulations showing the validity of the predictions of quasi-linear theory with
a constant-rate shear both in the non-rotating (Lee et al., 1990) and rotating
(Salhi & Cambon, 1997) case.

To solve equation (3), we introduce a Fourier transform with a wave number
in the x direction evolving in time in order to compute non-perturbatively the
eﬀect of the advection by the mean shear ﬂow (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell, 1964;
Townsend, 1976; Kim, 2005):

2.1 Transport of angular momentum

As the large-scale velocity is in the y direction, we are mostly interested in the
transport in that direction. The large-scale equation for the y component of
R where R
velocity U0 is given by equation (1) with a supplementary term
is the Reynolds stress given by:

∇ ·

vvyi
h
To understand the eﬀect of R on the transport of angular momentum, one
can formally Taylor expand it with respect to the gradient of the large-scale
ﬂow:

R =

= ΛiU0 + νT A

δi1 + . . . .

· · ·
where we introduced two transport coeﬃcients Λi and νT . The eﬀect of the tur-
bulent viscosity νT is simply to change the viscosity from the molecular value
ν to the eﬀective value ν + νT . Note that rotation may give a negative turbu-
lent viscosity, in which case the turbulent diﬀusion generates velocity gradients
rather than smooths them out. In comparison, the ﬁrst term in equation (7)
is proportional to the velocity rather than its gradient. This means that it
does not vanish for a constant velocity ﬁeld and thus permits the creation of
gradient in the large-scale velocity ﬁeld. This term is the equivalent to the α
eﬀect in dynamo theory (Parker, 1955; Steenbeck & Krause, 1966) and has been
known as the Λ-eﬀect (Lebedinsky, 1941; R¨udiger, 1980) or anisotropic kinetic
alpha (AKA)-eﬀect (Frisch et al., 1987). Symmetry property of equation (7)
shows that Λ is a polar vector and thus must change sign when going from
right-handed to left handed coordinates. This explains why this tensor cannot
be present in purely isotropic turbulence but can exist for an helical turbulence
[like the α-eﬀect]. In the presence of rotation and anisotropy of the background
medium, the turbulence is likely to be helical, possibly leading to Λ-eﬀect.

2.2 Particle (or heat) transport

To study the inﬂuence of rotation and shear on the particle and heat transport,
we have to supplement equation (1) with an advection-diﬀusion equation for
these quantities. We here focus on the transport of particles since a similar
result also holds for the heat transport. The density of particles N (x, t) is

where D is the molecular diﬀusivity of particle. Note that, in the case of heat
equation, D should be replaced by the molecular heat conductivity χ. Writing
the density as the sum of a large-scale component N0 and small-scale ﬂuctuations
n (N = N0 + n), we can express the evolution of the transport of chemicals on
large-scale by:

Equation (10) simply shows that the ﬂuctuating density of particles can be

2.3 External forcing

As mentioned in introduction, we consider a turbulence driven by an external
forcing f . To calculate the turbulence amplitude and transport deﬁned in
2.1
and
2.2, we need the two point correlation of this forcing (as all the quantities of
interest involve quadratic functions of velocity and/or density). For simplicity,
we prescribe this forcing to be short correlated in time (modelled by a δ-function)
with power spectrum ψij in the Fourier space. Speciﬁcally, we assume:

(11)

for i and j = 1, 2 or 3. The angular brackets stand for an average over realisa-
tions of the forcing, and τf is the (short) correlation time of the forcing.

For most results that will be derived later, we assume an incompressible and

isotropic forcing where the spectrum of the forcing is given by:

It is easy to check that in the absence of rotation and shear, this forcing leads
to an isotropic turbulence with intensity:

In addition to an isotropic forcing, we will also consider an anisotropic forcing
in
3.1.2 to examine the combined eﬀect of rotation and anisotropy, which can
lead to non-diﬀusive ﬂuxes of angular momentum. Speciﬁcally, we consider an
extremely anisotropic forcing with motion restricted to a plane perpendicular to

Figure 3 shows that the eigenfunctions diverge for τ

when b < 0.
This is because shear ﬂows in presence of rotation (perpendicular to the shear
ﬂow) is stable only for b > 0. This result agrees with Bradshaw (1969) and
Salhi & Cambon (1997). We can also notice that the solution with b > 0 always
decays faster than that with b < 0.

Unfortunately, computations of correlation functions with this exact solution
turns out to be too complex to be analytically tractable. To gain a physical
insight into the problem, we consider the two regimes of the strong and weak
(compared to shear) rotation limits, where approximate solutions can be derived
and then be used for deriving analytic results for the correlation functions.

In the following subsections, we compute the various correlation functions by
assuming a homogeneous and short-correlated forcing [see equation (11)]. As
the system (16) involves the forcing in terms of ˆh1 and ˆh2 only [see equation
(17)], we deﬁne the power spectrum φij as:

and exactly the same expression for the turbulence intensity in the other two
directions. These results indicate that, in the large rotation limit, the turbulence
intensity is isotropic and equals to the one without rotation [see equation (13)].
This result is consistent with the result of Cambon et al. (1997) which showed
that the anisotropy in rotating ﬂows was induced by non-linear interactions and
thus cannot be captured by a linear theory such as the one we used. However, in
the presence of strong shear ﬂows, the velocity amplitude is no longer isotropic,
as shown below.

vanishes after integration over the angular variables. equation (32) shows that
the turbulence intensity is reduced due to the shear
but eﬀectively stronger
in the x direction than in the perpendicular one, by a factor of ln ξ. This shows
that shear ﬂow can induce anisotropic turbulence (unlike rotation) even when
the forcing is isotropic. This results agree with the simulation of a Couette ﬂow
at high rotation rate (Bech & Andersson, 1997) where the velocity ﬂuctuations
perpendicular to the wall exceed that in the stream-wise direction. Furthermore,
with the same velocity ﬂuctuations in the
rapid rotation results in
y and z directions. This contrasts to the case of slow rotation (considered in

Equation (40) shows that the turbulent viscosity is negative (as F (k) > 0) in the
strong shear limit, in sharp contrast to the weak shear limit where νT > 0 [see
equation (38)]. Furthermore, the magnitude of νT is reduced only by the shear
2) and is independent of rotation, which should also be compared to the
(
∝ A
1]. Therefore, the turbulent
weak shear limit [see equation (38) where νT ∝
viscosity changes from positive (for weak shear) to negative (for large shear)
as the ratio of shear to dissipation increases. This result can be understood
if we assume that, as in most rapidly rotating ﬂuid, the inverse cascade is
associated with the conservation of a potential vorticity (Pedlovsky, 1987). In
presence of strong shear (compared to dissipation), the potential vorticity is
strictly conserved giving rise to an inverse cascade (negative viscosity). When
the dissipation increases, the potential vorticity is less and less conserved and
thus the inverse cascade is quenched. Our results show that there is a transition
from inverse to direct cascade as the dissipation is increased. A similar behaviour
is also found in two-dimensional hydrodynamics (HD) where an inverse cascade
can be shown to be present only for suﬃcient weak dissipation (Kim & Dubrulle,
2001).

The preceding results [equation (38) and (40)] indicate that in the large
rotation limit where rotation dominates over shear, the momentum transport

Equation (44) is odd in the rotation and thus represents the Λ-eﬀect. Again, the
latter favours the creation of velocity gradient rather than smoothing it out and
can thus provide a mechanism for the occurrence of diﬀerential rotation (e.g in
the sun). By using equation (15), one can see that the Λ-eﬀect is proportional to
the anisotropy in the turbulence without shear and rotation. This result shows
that, in the large rotation limit, one needs anisotropic forcing to generate non-
diﬀusive ﬂuxes of angular momentum (as in the case without shear as shown
3.2)
Kichatinov, 1986). This should be contrasted to the case of weak rotation (
§
where the shear can alone give rise to an anisotropic turbulence, thereby leading
to a Λ-eﬀect even with an isotropic forcing.

Finally, in the strong shear limit, equation (41) becomes:

which is even in the rotation. Thus, the turbulent viscosity νT is obviously
positive. Thus, in the large shear limit (but still negligible compared to the
rotation), anisotropic forcing does not induce any non-diﬀusive ﬂuxes but just
increases the magnitude of the negative turbulent viscosity.

transport in the direction of the rotation is twice larger than the one in the
perpendicular direction (Kichatinov et al., 1994). This anisotropy is present in
the transport of particles but not in the turbulence intensity [see equation (30)]
because rotation aﬀects only the phase between the diﬀerent velocity compo-
nents and not their magnitude. Note also that this anisotropy is much weaker
than that in sheared turbulence without rotation (Kim, 2005).

To summarise, this section shows how a shear ﬂow can aﬀect the turbulent
transport when turbulence is largely dominated by rapid rotation (
1).

In particular, the results indicate that shear ﬂow can induce a strong anisotropic
turbulence [equation (32)] (with an eﬀectively weaker turbulence in the direction
of the shear), which would otherwise be almost isotropic [equation (29)].

bulence (studied in Kim, 2005). In the weak rotation limit, we expand quantities
in powers of Ω0 =

by part. Equation (54) clearly shows that L1 is positive for all values of a (for
a < 0, the negative part of the integral is always smaller than the positive
one as the ﬁrst term is odd in τ and the second one is an increasing function
in equation (52) increases for
of a). Therefore, the turbulence intensity
¯Ω > 0 whereas it decreases for ¯Ω < 0. This can be understood from ﬁgure

β2 ¯Ω in the weak shear limit). Therefore, we

Here, Γ is the Gamma function. Equation (55) shows that, here again, the tur-
bulence amplitude is increased or decreased due to the weak rotation depending
on the sign of ¯Ω. Furthermore, the correction now has a logarithmic dependence
on the shear, contrary to the case of the amplitude in the shear (x) direction,
which is independent of shear [equation (52)]. Therefore, the turbulence in the
z plane is more aﬀected by rotation than the one in the x direction. As a
y
result, the turbulence due to shearing becomes less anisotropic. This illustrates
the tendency of rotation to lead to almost isotropic turbulence. The results for

the ﬂuctuating velocity in the direction of the ﬂow is larger than the one in the

(32) in the case of rapid rotation, where we showed that the turbuence in the

rotation is proportional to ¯Ω and is odd in the rotation. This is the so-called
Λ-eﬀect, a non-diﬀusive contribution to Reynolds stress. It is important to em-
phasise that non trivial Λ-eﬀect results from an anisotropy induced by shear
ﬂow on the turbulence even when the driving force is isotropic. This should be
contrasted to the case without shear ﬂow where non-diﬀusive ﬂuxes emerge only
for anisotropic forcing. A similar result was also found in
3.1.2 [see equations
(38) and (40)]. This Λ-eﬀect [the second term in equation (56)] is obviously of
the same sign as ¯Ω whereas the turbulent viscosity [the ﬁrst term in equation
(56)] can either be positive or negative, depending on the relative magnitude

symmetric perturbation with kz = 0 (β = 0), we can easily show that the tur-

in three-dimensional, the turbulent viscosity is positive. This is in agreement
with previous studies which showed that non-diﬀusive ﬂuxes of angular mo-
mentum (R¨udiger, 1980; Kichatinov, 1986) are proportional to the anisotropy
in the background turbulence. However, in our case, the anisotropy is not ar-
tiﬁcially introduced in the system but is created by the shear and calculated
self-consistently.

Equation (57) shows that the eﬀect of rotation on the transport of particles
depends on the sign of ¯Ω: for ¯Ω > 0, the transport is increased whereas it is
reduced for ¯Ω < 0. Again, this is because a weak rotation destabilises sheared
turbulence for ¯Ω > 0 whereas it stabilises for ¯Ω < 0 (see ﬁgure 3 and the
discussion at the beginning of
3). Note that a similar behaviour was also found
in turbulence intensity, given in equations (52) and (55). The correction term

To summarise, in the slow rotation limit, where turbulence is mainly reg-
ulated by shear ﬂow, the turbulence intensity [equations (52) and (55)] and
transport [equation (57)] are shown to be strongly anisotropic due to shear ﬂow
while they are slightly enhanced or reduced by rotation for ¯Ω > 0 or ¯Ω < 0,
respectively, to next order. The strong anisotropic turbulence was shown to give
rise to a Λ-eﬀect for momentum transport [equation (56)] even for an isotropic
forcing.

4 The parallel case (θ = 0)

We now study the case where the shear and the rotation are parallel as depicted

Due to the similarity between equation (62) and equation (21) obtained in the
perpendicular case in
3.1, the turbulence amplitude can easily be shown to
be the same as that of equation (26). Similarly, the turbulent viscosity is the
same as previously [see equation (33)] with a negative eddy-viscosity in the

odd in β and thus vanishes for an isotropic forcing, giving no contribution to
the eddy-viscosity. Consequently, the eddy viscosity vanishes to leading order
(for rotation and shear parallel) in the weak shear limit. Also, the transport of
particles is the same as previously [see equation (50)] both in the strong and
weak shear limit.

4.2 Weak rotation limit: Ω

≪ A

In the weak rotation limit, we expand all the quantities in powers of Ω0 as:

X(τ ) = X0(τ ) + Ω0X1(τ ) + . . . .

(64)

Contrary to the perpendicular case, we ﬁnd that the leading order correction
(proportional to Ω0) vanishes in the case of an isotropic forcing (because these
terms are odd in β) for all the previously calculated quantities. However, the
component of the Reynolds stress involving the velocity component vz does not
vanish and is odd in Ω. Thus, the Λ-eﬀect appears here in the other component
of the Reynolds stress Λz (recall that in the perpendicular case, the Λ-eﬀect was
present only in

), in the form:

4.3 Symmetric perturbation (β = 0)

In this section, we consider a symmetric perturbation with kz = 0 by assum-
ing a forcing that is symmetric in the z direction. For β = kz/ky = 0, the
homogeneous part of the ﬁrst equation in (58) becomes:

the conﬁguration where the shear and the rotation are parallel [see equation (59)
with γ = 1]. Solutions of the homogeneous problem are thus Bessel functions.
Using the method of variation of parameters, we can then express the general
solution of the ﬁrst equation to (58) as:

leading order behaviour for ξ
behaves as 1/τ for τ

We now examine the turbulence amplitude in the large rotation limit: Ω0 ≫
1. To do so, we use the asymptotic behaviour of the integrals (71) derived in
appendix B.1.2. Using equations (91) and (93) in equation(70), we obtain the

Table 1: Summary of our results obtained both for the perpendicular and par-
allel cases in the strong shear limit. In the perpendicular case, the rotation is
in the z direction whereas it is in the x direction in the parallel case. In both
cases, the shear is in the x direction. The C symbol stands for an additional
constant of order 1.

The transport of particles in equation (79) involves two contributions, both

5.1 Stability of rotating shear ﬂows

−

−

A

¯Ω(1

Our ﬁrst result concerns the stability of shear ﬂows in the presence of rotation.
In the case where the rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the ﬂuid motion
(see ﬁgure 1), we recovered the Bradshaw criterion (Bradshaw, 1969). In our
¯Ω) < 0
notation, it states that the conﬁguration is unstable if B =
or, equivalently, if ¯Ω = Ω/
lies in the interval [0 , 1]. This result has al-
ready been reported by many authors, who showed not only that the maximum
destabilisation occurs for ¯Ω = 1/2 but also that the there is an important asym-
metry with respect to ¯Ω = 1/2 which is not included in the Bradshaw criterion
(Speziale & Mhuiris, 1989; Cambon et al., 1994; Salhi & Cambon, 1997). This
is because Bradshaw criterion can be recovered by a pressure-less analysis while
the eﬀect of pressure is to destroy this symmetry. We can easily show this
asymmetry with respect to ¯Ω = 1/2 in our results: even if the equation (18)
for the x-component of the velocity is symmetric with respect to ¯Ω = 1/2 (as
β2B), equation (19) for the other components of the
it depends only on b =
velocity are not because of the term proportional to ¯Ω
1. In the parallel case
(see ﬁgure 4), we found that the system was stable regardless of the values of
shear and rotation.

5.2 Turbulence amplitude

ln ξ

The ﬁrst two rows of Table 1 show that the turbulence amplitude in the direction
of the shear (x) is more reduced by the shear than in the perpendicular one. This
is true both for the large rotation limit, where they scale as ξ0 and
(recall
that ξ = νk2
1) respectively, and for the weak rotation limit, where they
y/
A ≪
2/3 respectively. These results thus imply an eﬀectively
1 and
scale as
−
stronger turbulence in the plane (y-z) than in the x-direction. This anisotropic
reduction of turbulence amplitude is mainly due to the shear which increases
the dissipation (anisotropically) by eﬃciently creating small-scale ﬂuctuations
in the x-direction. Furthermore, the turbulence amplitude is aﬀected by the
rotation only in the case where the rotation is perpendicular to the shear ﬂow
and in the weak rotation limit. This is because rotation aﬀects the stability
of shear ﬂows only in this case, as mentioned previously. Here we recover the
1, a positive ¯Ω tends to destabilise the turbulence
Bradshaw criterion: for ¯Ω
(the kinetic energy is increased) whereas a negative value tends to stabilise
, the eﬀect of rotation on turbulence is weakly
the turbulence. For Ω
anisotropic, suppressing the turbulence in the y
z plane more than the one
in the x-direction by a factor of ln ξ. As a result, the anisotropy due to shear
ﬂow is weakened by rotation. This reﬂects the tendency of rotation to lead to
almost isotropic turbulence.

5.3 Transport of angular momentum

The transport of angular momentum was found to involve two contributions:
the turbulent viscosity νT and the Λ-eﬀect. The former is a diﬀusive transport
making the eﬀective viscosity to νT + ν (ν is the molecular viscosity) while
the latter is a non-diﬀusive momentum transport. Our results show that the
turbulent viscosity does not depend on the relative orientation of the shear and
rotation. We also found a transition from a negative viscosity, for large rotation,

27

to a positive viscosity, for weak rotation. This shows the inﬂuence of rotation to
favour transfer of energy from small-scales to large-scales (inverse cascade). In
comparison, the Λ-eﬀect is a source of non-diﬀusive ﬂux and prevents a uniform
rotation to be solution of the averaged Reynolds equation. This term is present
with an isotropic forcing in contrast with the case without shear where a source
of anisotropy in the system is necessary for such an eﬀect to appear. This is
due to the fact that, even for an isotropic forcing, the shear induces anisotropy
in the system as shown here and by Kim (2005). In the case of an anisotropic
turbulence, it was shown that the Λ-eﬀect was proportional to the anisotropy in
the velocity ﬁeld (Kichatinov, 1986; R¨udiger, 1989). Here, in the perpendicular
whereas the anisotropy in
case, we found that the Λ-eﬀect scales as

4/3. Consequently, the
the velocity amplitude is given, at leading order, by
Λ-eﬀect is smaller than the anisotropy in the turbulent velocity amplitude. This
is because the anisotropy is not simply given here but has to be induced self-
consistently by the shear during the evolution. Consequently, the anisotropy
does not remain the same at all time and the resulting Λ-eﬀect is smaller than
the anisotropy in the velocity amplitude for large time. One can also note that
the magnitude of the Λ-eﬀect is not the same in the two cases. In the parallel
case, it scales as
.

Thus, the eﬀect is larger in the parallel case than in the perpendicular case.

5.4 Transport of scalar

In the case of rapid rotation, we found that the transport of scalars is mainly
1 in all directions. The transport in the
governed by the rotation, scaling as Ω−
direction parallel to the rotation is twice larger than the one in the perpendicular
direction (see equation (50) and Kichatinov et al., 1994) with a slight anisotropy.
However, in the weak rotation limit, the transport of chemical species is reduced
by shear with a stronger reduction in the direction parallel to the shear than in
4/3 respectively). Furthermore,
the perpendicular one (by a factor
there is a (weak) reduction due to rotation but only in the perpendicular case.
These results are consistent with the calculations of Brethouwer (2005) as the
anisotropy in the transport of particles is the same as that in the turbulent in-
tensity. This is because, in the quasi-linear approximation, the rotation favours
isotropy with the anisotropy of both quantities being caused by the shear only.

where ω0 = (Ω
k)/k is the projection of the unit vector in the direction of
the wave number on the rotation axis. When the domain of integration is
unbounded, the integration over the angular variable gives this integral propor-
1, when the rotation rate Ω is suﬃciently large [see equation (36-38)
tional to Ω−
for details]. This is because this integral involves some contribution of order 1
(when Ω

k = 0) and others of magnitude Ω−

However, in most practical applications, the domain of integration in Fourier
space is bounded. Thus there is a minimal wavenumber (corresponding to a
maximum length, for instance the size of the box) in the direction of the rotation

5.6 Comparison with stratiﬁcation

It is well known that compressibility can inhibit mixing and reduce energy am-
pliﬁcation produced by a large-scale shear (see Simone et al., 1997, and refer-
ences therein). Furthermore, the analogy between rotating and stratiﬁed ﬂows
(Greenspan, 1968), which has been used by Bradshaw (1969) to derive his cri-
terion, can be used to comment on the case with shear and stratiﬁcation. Salhi
(2002) has shown that, by the normal analysis, the perpendicular case (studied
here) is equivalent to the case with a stratiﬁcation in the x-direction (except
when Ω
k = 0). Thus, the stratiﬁed case in the x-direction is expected to be
very similar to the case where the rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the
ﬂow.
Indeed, in that case, we found (Kim & Leprovost, 2006) that the scal-
ing of the turbulent intensity and the turbulent viscosity do not depend on the
Brunt-Va¨ıs¨al¨a frequency N (which characterises the intensity of the stratiﬁca-
tion and thus plays the same role as Ω in the rotating case) and have the same
scalings as those given in the ﬁrst column of Table 1. Kim & Leprovost (2006)

also found that the transport of scalar was reduced proportional to N −
corresponds to the case discussed in

5.5.

§

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have performed a thorough investigation of the combined ef-
fects of shear and rotation on the structure of turbulence. While both rotation
and (stable) shear ﬂow tend to regulate turbulence, there are important diﬀer-
ences in their eﬀects, which should be emphasised. Rotation, by exciting inertial
waves, tends to reduce turbulence transport more heavily than turbulence am-
plitude while shear ﬂows reduce both of them to a similar degree. That is,
rotation (or waves) quenches the cross-phase (normalised ﬂux) more than shear
ﬂow does (Kim & Diamond, 2003; Kim, 2006). Furthermore, in sharp contrast
with rotation, shear ﬂow induces a strong anisotropic turbulence and transport
(e.g. momentum transport, chemical mixing, etc.). On the other hand, rotation
acting together with shear ﬂow is shown to give rise to a novel, non-diﬀusive
ﬂux for momentum transport (the so-called Λ-eﬀect) which transfers energy
from the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld to the large-scale ﬂow. In comparison, the
eddy viscosity from the diﬀusive part of momentum transport is found to be
negative for strong shear and rotation.

These results can have signiﬁcant implications for astrophysical and geophys-
ical systems. In particular, the Λ-eﬀect and/or negative viscosity can provide
a mechanism for the generation of ubiquitous large-scale shear ﬂows, which are
often observed in these objects. Furthermore, the anisotropic mixing of scalars
should be taken into account in understanding the surface depletion of light
elements in stars (Pinsonneault, 1997).

29

Finally, we note that numerical conﬁrmation of our prediction as well as the
extension of our work to three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics with rota-
tion remain important problems, and will be addressed in future publications.

behaviour of these integrals to simplify our results.

Following Kim (2005), we change the integration variable from τ to y = 2ξτ 3/3,
replace the Bessel function by the expression valid for large argument (ξ

asymptotic behaviour of this integral with F (t) = f (t) cos[Ω0φ(t)] and the phase
given by φ(t) = √1 + a2
√1 + t2. The diﬃculty associated with the calculation
of such integral is the presence of a point of stationary phase t = 0 where the
integral cannot be done with an integration by part.

For a > 0, the point of stationary phase is never reached and then, the ﬁrst

integral can be approximated, for Ω0 ≫

In that case, the contribution from the stationary point cancels out as I(0) = 0.
Therefore, for a = 0, the only contribution comes from the end point of the
integration and is the same as for a > 0 [see equation (96)].

Performing the same procedure when F (t) = f (t) sin[Ω0φ(t)], we obtain the

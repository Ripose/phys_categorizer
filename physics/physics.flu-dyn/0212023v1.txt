Abstract

In the framework of the variational principle there are introduced canonical variables
describing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂows of general type without any restrictions
for invariants of the motion. It is shown that the velocity representation of the Clebsch
type introduced by means of the variational principle with constraints is equivalent to
the representation following from the generalization of the Weber transformation for the
case of arbitrary MHD ﬂows. The integrals of motion and local invariants for MHD are
under examination. It is proved that there exists generalization of the Ertel invariant. It
is expressed in terms of generalized vorticity ﬁeld (discussed earlier by Vladimirov and
Moﬀatt (V. A. Vladimirov, H. K. Moﬀatt, J. Fl. Mech., 283, pp. 125–139, 1995) for the
incompressible case). The generalized vorticity presents the frozen-in ﬁeld for the barotropic
and isentropic ﬂows and therefore for these ﬂows there exists generalized helicity invariant.
This result generalizes one obtained by Vladimirov and Moﬀatt in the cited work for the
incompressible ﬂuid. It is shown that to each invariant of the conventional hydrodynamics
corresponds MHD invariant and therefore our approach allows correct limit transition to
the conventional hydrodynamic case. The additional advantage of the approach proposed
enables one to deal with discontinuous ﬂows, including all types of possible breaks.

1 Introduction.

It is well-known that description of the solid media ﬂows in terms of the canonical (hamil-
tonian) variables is very useful and eﬀective, see for instance [1, 2]. In terms of the hamiltonian
variables it is possible to deal with all nonlinear processes in uniﬁed terms not depending on the
speciﬁc problem related to the media under investigation. For instance, all variants of the per-
turbation theory are expressed in terms of diﬀerent order nonlinear vertices, which along with
the linear dispersion relation contain the speciﬁc information relating to the concrete system
under investigation, cf. Refs. [3, 4]. In the problems of the nonlinear stability investigations the
conventional Hamiltonian approach based upon the corresponding variational principle allows

1

one to use the Hamiltonian along with other integrals of motion (momentum, number of quasi-
particles, topological invariants) in order to construct the relevant Lyapunov functional, cf. Refs.
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Therefore, it makes important the problem of introducing the canonical variables
and corresponding variational principle for the general type MHD ﬂows (i. e., non-barotropic
and including all types of the breaks possible for MHD) and obtaining the complete set of the
local invariants, see deﬁnition and discussions in original papers [10, 11, 12, 13] and in the recent
review [1]. As for the ﬁrst item, the example of the variational principle describing all possible
breaks is presented in the recent work [14].

Here in the framework of some modiﬁcation of the variational principle of the cited work we
examine the problem of the MHD invariants. Note that the set of invariants for MHD discussed
in the literature till now is incomplete. It becomes evident if one takes into account that for
the vanishing magnetic ﬁeld this set has to go over to the set of the conventional hydrodynamic
invariants. But this limit transition does not reproduce Ertel, vorticity and helicity invariants
existing for the hydrodynamic ﬂows. For the particular case of incompressible MHD ﬂows
generalized vorticity and helicity invariants were obtained in the paper [8]. Below we show that
the generalized vorticity and helicity invariants exist also for compressible barotropic ﬂows, and
derive MHD generalization for the Ertel invariant.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we brieﬂy discuss appropriate variational
principle, introducing the Clebsch type velocity representation by means of constraints and
deﬁning the canonical variables. In the following section 3 we develop generalization of the Weber
transformation and show that it leads to the velocity representation, which is equivalent to the
In section 4 we examine MHD
one following from the variational principle under discussion.
integrals of motion, introducing ‘missing’ MHD invariants, and discuss their transformation
properties relating to change of gauge. In section 5 we make some conclusions and formulate
problems to be solved later.

2 Variational principle and canonical variables.

Let us brieﬂy describe the variational principle and subsidiary variables describing dissipation-

free MHD. Starting with the standard Lagrangian density

L = ρ

− ρε(ρ, s) −

v2

H2
8π

,

where ρ, s and ε(ρ, s) present the ﬂuid density, entropy and internal energy, respectively, H
denotes magnetic ﬁeld, we have to include to the action A the constraint terms. Then the action
can be presented in the form

A =

where Lc is the part of the Lagrangian density respective for constraints,

(3)

Here D = ∂t + (v∇) is substantial (material) derivative and A is the vector potential.1 Including
the last two terms into Lc allows us to introduce relation H = curlA strictly into the variational
principle (it follows after variation with respect to H).

Supposing ﬁrst that all variables introduced (including velocity) are independent we obtain

the set of variational equations of the form

δϕ =⇒ ∂tρ + div(ρv) = 0,

δρ =⇒ Dϕ = w − v2/2 ,

δλ =⇒ Dµ = 0 ,

δµm =⇒ ∂tλm + div(λmv) = 0,

δσ =⇒ Ds = 0,

δs =⇒ ∂tσ + div(σv) = −ρT,

δM =⇒ ∂tA = [v, curlA] − ∇Λ,

δA =⇒ ∂tM =

+ curl[v, M].

δH =⇒ H = curlA,

δΛ =⇒ divM = 0,

(11)

(12)

(13)

where w and T are the enthalpy density and temperature.

Note that in this section we suppose the velocity ﬁeld to be independent on other variables.

Therefore, variation with respect to v gives us the velocity representation:

δv =⇒ ρv = −ρ∇ϕ − λm∇µm − σ∇s − [H, M] .

(14)

It is convenient to rewrite it in a shortened form that emphasizes it’s structure. Bearing in mind
that the velocity potential ϕ, vector Lagrange markers µ, entropy s and the vector potential A
can be treated as generalized coordinates, one can see that ρ, λ, σ and subsidiary ﬁeld M are
conjugated momenta, respectively. Let

Q = (Q, A), Q = (ϕ, µ, s), P = δA/δ∂tQ, P = (P, M).

(15)

1 This form of the action slightly diﬀers from the one proposed in Ref.

[14]. The main diﬀerence consists
in introducing the vector potential for the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, here the canonical pair is A, M instead of
H, S, where S = curlM. We do not deal here with the discontinuous ﬂows and thus we omit the surface term in
the action. But adding corresponding surface term we can easily take the breaks into account.

Then the velocity representation takes the transparent form

v = v0(P, ∇Q), v0 = vh + vM , vh = −

∇Q, vM = −

[H, M] .

(16)

P
ρ

ρ

Here subindexes h and M correspond to the ”hydrodynamic” and ”magnetic” parts of the ve-
locity ﬁeld. The hydrodynamic part, vh, corresponds to the generalized Clebsch representation,
compare papers [15, 16, 14], and magnetic part, vM , coincides with the conventional term if we
replace the divergence-free ﬁeld M by curlS. The latter was ﬁrst introduced by Zakharov and
Kuznetsov, cf. Ref. [17].

From the velocity representation Eq. (16) and the equations of motion (4) – (11) it strictly
follows that the velocity ﬁeld v = v0 satisﬁes Euler equation with the magnetic force taken into
account. Namely, providing diﬀerentiation we obtain

ρDv0 = −∇p +

[curlH, H],

(17)

4π

where p is the ﬂuid pressure.

2.1 Canonical variables.

The variational principle can be easily reformulated in the Hamiltonian form. Excluding the
magnetic and velocity ﬁelds by means of Eqs. (12), (16) we arrive to the following Hamiltonian
density

H = H(P, ∇Q) = P∂tQ − L′ = ρ

+ ρε(ρ, s) +

− (M, ∇Λ).

(18)

v2

Equations of motion (4) – (11) can be expressed now in the canonical form

∂tQ = δHV /δP ,

∂tP = −δHV /δQ ,

Q = (ϕ, µ, s; A) , P = (ρ, λ, σ; M) ;

(19)

Eq. (12) serves as a deﬁnition of magnetic ﬁeld, and divergence-free condition for the subsidiary
ﬁeld M, Eq. (13), follows from variation of the action

A =

dt

Z

Z

dr (P∂tQ − H)

(20)

with respect to Λ. Note that it is possible to put Λ = 0. Under this assumption the divergence-
free condition for the ﬁeld M vanishes, but from Eq. (11) follows that divM is conserved quantity,
and supposing that divM = 0 holds for some initial moment we arrive to the conclusion that
this is valid for arbitrary moment. Nevertheless, it proves convenient to deal with Λ 6= 0 that
makes it possible to use diﬀerent gauge conditions for the vector potential.

The variational principle presented gives us the set of dynamic equations from which follow
conventional MHD equations, (4), (9), (17) and equation for the frozen-in magnetic ﬁeld, which
follows from Eq. (10) after taking curl operation,

∂tH = curl[v, H].

(21)

4

On the contrary, if at some initial moment, t = ¯t, we have the conventional MHD ﬁelds ¯ρ,
¯s, ¯v and ¯H, then we can ﬁnd the initial subsidiary ﬁelds ¯ϕ, ¯µ, ¯λ, ¯σ, ¯A, ¯M and ¯Λ, satisfying
Eqs. (12) – (14). This can be done up to the gauge transformations (do not changing the velocity
and magnetic ﬁeld) due to the fact that the subsidiary ﬁelds play a role of generalized potentials.
Then, if the uniqueness conditions hold both for the conventional MHD equations and for the
set of variational equations, we arrive to the conclusion that corresponding solutions coincide for
all moments. In this sense we can say that these sets of equations are equivalent, cf. Ref. [4].

The complete representation of the velocity ﬁeld in the form of the generalized Clebsch
representation, Eq. (16) allows, ﬁrst, to deal with the MHD ﬂows of general type, including all
types of breaks, cf. Ref. [14]; second, for the zero magnetic ﬁeld it gives correct limit transition
to the conventional hydrodynamics, cf. Refs. [16], [15]; third, it allows to obtain the additional
to the known ones integrals and invariants of motion for the MHD ﬂows: for instance, generalized
Ertel invariant, generalized vorticity and generalized helicity, see below. The two last integrals
were deduced for the particular case of incompressible ﬂows in the paper [8].

Moreover, it is possible to show that representation (16) is equivalent to the one following
from the Weber transformation, cf. Refs. [18, 19] and the recent review [1]. The generalization
of the Weber transformation for the ideal MHD incompressible ﬂows was obtained by Vladimirov
and Moﬀatt, cf. Ref. [8].

3 Generalized Weber transformation.

Suppose here that the ﬂuid particles are labelled by Lagrange markers a = (a1, a2, a3). The

label of the particle passing through point r = (x1, x2, x3) at time t is then

and

a = a(r, t),

Da =

+ (v · ∇)a = 0.

The particle paths and velocities are given by the inverse function

Let the initial position of the particle labelled a is X, i.e.,

A natural choice of label would be X(a) = a; however it is convenient to retain the extra freedom
represented by the “rearrangement function” X(a).

Then we can transform the last term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (30) to the form of substantial derivative,
see Appendix

Analogously, the ﬁrst two terms in the r.h.s. of Eq. (30) can be presented as substantial
derivatives by means of introducing subsidiary functions ϕ and σ, which satisfy equations (com-
pare Eqs. (9), (5))

This representation obviously coincides with the Clebsch representation obtained above from
the variational principle with constraints if one identiﬁes b with −λ/ρ and a with µ. Moreover,
this proves equivalence of description of the general type magnetohydrodynamic ﬂows in terms of
canonical variables introduced and the conventional description in Lagrange or Euler variables.
The equations of motion for the generalized coordinates and momenta follow now from deﬁnitions
of the subsidiary variables a, m = M/ρ, σ, ϕ and b.

Emphasize here that the vector ﬁeld M = ρm introduced by Eq. (31) satisﬁes integral relation

where Σ presents some oriented area moving with the ﬂuid. The proof of this statement see
in Appendix. Expressing M = curlS and making use of the Stocks theorem we arrive to a
conclusion that time derivative of the vector S circulation over the closed frozen-in contour ∂Σ
is proportional to the current (remind, J = (4π)−1curlH and diﬀers from the current density by
constant multiplier) intersecting the surface deﬁned by this contour,

where tilde indicates that we are dealing with the velocity ﬁeld in the Lagrange description, i.e.,

It diﬀers from the one presented in Ref. [4] by involving the entropy term. Emphasize here
that existence of this term allows to describe general type MHD and hydrodynamic ﬂows with
arbitrary possible discontinuities, including shocks, slides and rotational breaks, cf. Ref. [15, 16,
14]. One can omit this term for continuous barotropic and isentropic ﬂows.

4 Integrals of motion.

The conservation laws, as it is well-known, follow from the speciﬁc symmetries of the action.
Existence of the relabelling transformations group (ﬁrst discussed by Salmon in Ref.
[21]) of
the Lagrange markers, µ, leads to the additional to the energy, the ﬂuid momentum and mass
integrals of motion. These additional integrals are expressed in terms of the Lagrange description
of the motion, i.e., in terms of the Lagrange markers, etc. Therefore, as a rule, they are gauge
dependent. The frozen-in character of the magnetic ﬁeld leads to the speciﬁc topological integrals
of motion, namely, magnetic helicity and, cross-helicity, ﬁrst discussed by Moﬀatt in Ref. [22],
see also review [1]. Corresponding densities are respectively

and

hM = (A, H),

hC = (v, H).

As it strictly follows from the dynamic equations, the local conservation law for the magnetic
helicity holds true for general type MHD ﬂows

∂thM + divqM = 0, qM = vhM − H · ((A, v) + Λ) .

On the contrary, the cross-helicity in general case is governed by equation

∂thC/∂t = −div

vhC + (w − v2/2)H

+ T div(sH)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

and is not conserved. But for barotropic and isentropic ﬂows the pressure p = p(ρ) and hC is
conserved:

∂thC + divqC = 0, qC = vhC + (χ − v2/2)H,

(50)

where χ =

dp/ρ.

For the general case there is known one more conserved quantity ﬁrst discovered by Gordin

R

and Petviashvili, cf. Ref. [23]. Corresponding density is

and

With this local conserved quantity there is linked integral conservation law. Namely, inte-

grating hP over arbitrary substantial volume

V we obtain conserved quantity IP ,

hP = (H, ∇s),

∂thP + divqP = 0, qP = vhP .

IP =

∂tα + (v, ∇)α = 0 ,

∂tI + (v, ∇)I = 0 ,

∂tJ + (v, ∇)J − (J, ∇)v = 0 ,

Note here that the latter quantity gives us example of the so called local Lagrange invariants,

cf. Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13] and [2, 1]. By deﬁnition they obey the following equations

∂tL + (v, ∇)L + (L, ∇)v + [L, curlv] = 0, or, equivalently, ∂tL + ∇(v, L) − [v, curlL] = 0. (56)

Here α and I present the scalar and vector Lagrange invariants, J is frozen-in ﬁeld, and L
presents S-type invariant in terminology of Ref.
[12], related to frozen-in surface. To these
invariants it is necessary to add the density ρ. Evidently, the quantity hP /ρ presents α-type
invariant. The Lagrange markers µ and quantities λ/ρ give us examples of the vector Lagrange
invariants, magnetic ﬁeld H divided by ρ, h = H/ρ is invariant of the J- type, gradient of any
scalar Lagrange invariant is S-type invariant,

There exist also another relations between diﬀerent type invariants, see Refs. [2, 1], allowing
to produce new invariants. For instance, scalar product of the J and L invariants presents some
scalar Lagrange invariant, symbolically

The presented above invariant hP /ρ can be obtained by means of this relation if we put J = h
and L = ∇s. Another examples present relations generating J- (L)- type invariants by means
of two L- (J-) type invariants,

to the conserved integral. It is easy to check that

will be integral of motion if Hn equals zero. This fact leads to the conclusion that IM presents

integral of motion if we choose the substantial volume in such a way that initial volume
is such that Hn|t=t0 = 0 because this condition is invariant of the motion: if equality Hn = 0
holds for the initial moment then it holds true in the future.

e

e

Another way to make IM invariant consists in ﬁxing the gauge of the vector potential A in

such a way that (A, v) + Λ = 0. Then the dynamic equation for A, (10), takes the form

∂tA + ∇(v, A) − [v, curlA] = 0,

i.e., A presents invariant of the L- type. Under this gauge condition the quantity hM /ρ presents
the scalar Lagrange invariant, D(hM /ρ) = 0.

As for the local conservation law for the cross-helicity, Eq. (50), it obviously leads to the
integral conserved quantity IC for the barotropic ﬂows but with following restriction: integration
have to be performed over the speciﬁc substantial volume such one that condition Hn|∂
V = 0
(this condition is invariant of the motion) holds,

Existence of the recursive procedure allowing one to construct new invariants on the basis
of the starting set of invariants, see Refs. [2, 1], accentuates the role of the local invariants
among other conserved quantities. Although in terms of the Lagrangian variables (such as the
markers µ) there exist a wide set of invariants, see, for instance, Ref. [1], the most interesting
invariants are such that can be expressed in Eulerian (physical) variables and are gauge invariant.
Emphasize here that in the conventional hydrodynamics there exists Ertel invariant αE,

αE = hE/ρ,

hE = (ω, ∇s),

where ω = curlv is vorticity,

∂thE + divqE = 0, qE = hEv, DαE = 0.

Corresponding integral of motion reads

The Ertel invariant density has the structure of the Eq. (58) with L = ∇s, J = ω/ρ, where
ω is vorticity, ω = curlv (remind that ω is a frozen-in ﬁeld for the barotropic hydrodynamic
ﬂows). In the hydrodynamic case there exists also the helicity invariant

hH = (ω, v),

which has topological meaning, deﬁning knottness of the ﬂow. It satisﬁes equation

∂thH + divqH = 0, qH = hH v + (χ − v2/2)ω,

For the MHD case the vector ω/ρ does not present frozen-in ﬁeld due to the fact that
magnetic force is not potential. It seems rather evident that for the MHD case there have to
exist integrals of motion generalizing the conventional helicity and Ertel invariant along with
vorticity one, which have to pass into conventional ones for vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. The
generalization for the vorticity and helicity invariants was obtained by authors of the paper [8]
for the particular case of the incompressible ﬂows. In the following section it is shown that there
exists MHD generalization for the Ertel invariant, and results of the paper [8] relating to the
vorticity and helicity can be extended for incompressible barotropic MHD ﬂows.

presents frozen-in ﬁeld (‘hydrodynamic’ part of the vorticity) for the barotropic MHD ﬂows. It
would be trivial consequence of the fact that [L, L′]/ρ, where L, L′ are Lamb type invariants, is
local invariant of the frozen-in type if all quantities Q and P/ρ satisfy homogeneous transport
equations being α- or I type invariants (remember, that ∇α and ∇Im are L type invariants).
But ϕ and σ/ρ satisfy inhomogeneous equations of motion. Therefore, let us start with equation
of motion for the ‘hydrodynamic’ part of the velocity. Diﬀerentiating representation (16) and
making use of relations

D(∇X) = ∇(DX) − (∇vm) · ∂mX

we have

Dvh = −D

or, after simple rearrangements,

Dvh = −∇p/ρ + (vm − vhm) · ∇vm .

Taking the curl of this equation leads to

∂tωh = −curl((vm∂m)vh) + [∇ρ, ∇p]/ρ2 − curl(vhm∇vm) =

= [∇ρ, ∇p]/ρ2 + curl[(vm∇vhm) − (vhm∇vm)] .
The term in the square brackets is equal to [(vm∇vhm) − (vhm∇vm)] = [v, ωh] and we obtain

For barotropic ﬂows the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. becomes zero and we can see that ωh/ρ is
frozen-in ﬁeld,

∂tωh = [∇ρ, ∇p]/ρ2 + curl[v, ωh] .

For H = 0 ωh corresponds to the conventional hydrodynamic vorticity.

In spite of the gauge dependence of the generalized vorticity, it frozenness gives us possibility

to introduce the generalized helicity integral of motion.

4.2 Generalized helicity.

Now we can prove that generalized helicity, hH , deﬁned in terms of the ‘hydrodynamic’ part

of the velocity,

hH = (ωh, vh),

is integral of motion for barotropic ﬂows. Namely, diﬀerentiating Eq. (73) and taking for account
Eqs. (70), (71) we arrive for the barotropic ﬂows to the local conservation law of the form (rather
cumbersome calculations are presented in Appendix):

∂thH + divqH = 0, qH = hHv + (χ − v2/2)ωh .

In analogy with the hydrodynamic case we arrive to the conclusion that the integral helicity
IH (deﬁned by means of Eq. (68)) is integral invariant, moving together with the ﬂuid if the
normal component of the vorticity tends zero, ωhn = 0, on the surface of the corresponding
V . Note that the condition ωhn = 0 is invariant of the ﬂow (due to the
substantial volume
frozen–in character of ωh/ρ) and therefore it can be related to the initial surface only.

e

4.3 Generalized Ertel invariant.

Let us show here that there exists strict generalization of the Ertel invariant for the MHD
case. For this purpose let us prove that without any restrictions related to the character of the
ﬂow the quantity

satisﬁes conservation law of the form

hE = (ωh, ∇s)

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

∂thE + divqE = 0, qE = hEv.

12

Equivalently, the quantity αE = hE/ρ is transported by the ﬂuid

DαE = 0, αE = hE/ρ,

(77)

(78)

presenting α- type invariant. For the barotropic ﬂows it immediately follows from the fact that
ωh/ρ presents frozen-in ﬁeld if one takes for account the composition rules given by Eqs. (58) and
(57). In order to make the proof for the non barotropic ﬂows more transparent let us consider
something more general situation. Let

J satisfy equation of motion of the form

e
J = (
D

J, ∇)v + Z,

diﬀering from the frozen ﬁeld equation (55) by existence of the term Z that violates homogeneity.
Then, if α represents any scalar Lagrange invariant, we have

e

and Dα = 0.

e

For Z = 0 this relations prove the generating rule of Eq. (58). But we can see that (
J, ∇α)
will present the local Lagrange invariant under more restrictive condition (Z, ∇α) = 0. That is
the case for the Ertel invariant: Z = [∇ρ, ∇p]/ρ3 is orthogonal to ∇s due to the fact that the
scalar product of any three thermodynamic quantities is equal zero (because any thermodynamic
variable in the equilibrium state can be presented as function of two basic variables). This ends
the proof.

e

The conserved integral quantity associated with αE is

IE =

drhE ,

∂tIE = 0.

(80)

Note here that by the structure IE is not gauge invariant in contrast to the hydrodynamic case.
Let us examine it change under gauge transformation changing vh ⇒ v′

But (∇s, ωM − ω′

Inasmuch as both M′ and M satisfy Eq. (11), their diﬀerence is governed by homogeneous
equation

∂tM = curl[v, M],

i.e. m = M/ρ is frozen-in ﬁeld. Then we arrive to the conclusion that the vector [∇s, [h, m]]
entering the integrand presents frozen-in ﬁeld, as it follows from recursive relations Eqs. (57) –
(59). Therefore, if we adopt relation (n, [∇s, [h, m]])|∂
V = 0 as initial condition, then it holds
true for all moments. But we cannot choose the (initial) substantial volume in such a way that
relation

e

(n, [∇s, [h, m′]])|∂

V = (n, [∇s, [h, m]])|∂
e

V

(82)

holds true for any change of the gauge. Thus integral Ertel invariant is gauge dependent.
Nevertheless, we can point out some subset of the gauge transformations under which IE is
invariant. Namely, let M|t=t0 = f H for some initial moment, t = t0, where f have to satisfy
condition (H, ∇f ) = 0, following from the divergence–free character of M. Then relation (82)
fulﬁlls for the initial moment and therefore it holds true at all moments also. The speciﬁc choice
f = 0 leads to additional restriction for the gauge transformations but it is convenient due to
its simplicity. Summarizing, we can say that the Ertel invariant is partly gauge independent.

5 Conclusions.

The results obtained can be summarized as follows. First, there is presented variant of
introducing the canonical description of the MHD ﬂows by means of the variational principle
with constraints. It is shown that in order to describe general type MHD ﬂows it is necessary
to use in the generalized Clebsch type representation of the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld vector Clebsch
variables (the Lagrange markers and conjugate momenta) along with the entropy term (compare
papers [15, 16] describing hydrodynamic case) and the conventional magnetic term introduced
ﬁrst in the paper [17]. Such complete representation allows one to deal with general type MHD
ﬂows, including all type of breaks, see Ref.
[14]. Second, it is proved that introduced in the
paper generalized Weber transformation leads to the velocity representation, which equivalent to
the one introduced by means of the variational principle. Third, there is proved existence of the
generalized Ertel invariant for MHD ﬂows. Forth, there are generalized the vorticity and helicity
invariants for the compressible barotropic MHD ﬂows (ﬁrst discussed for the incompressible case
in cf. [8]). Fifth, the relations between the local and integral invariants are discussed along with
the gauge dependence of the latter.

As a consequence of the completeness of the representation proposed we arrive to the correct
limit transition from the MHD to conventional hydrodynamic ﬂows. The results obtained allow
one to deal with the complicated MHD problems by means of the Hamiltonian variables. The
use of such approach was demonstrated for the speciﬁc case of incompressible ﬂows in the series
of papers [8, 9] devoted to the nonlinear stability criteria. Emphasize, that existence of the
additional invariants proved in our paper is of very importance for the stability problems.

Note here that existing of the additional basic invariants of the motion makes it actual
to examine the problem of the complete set of independent invariants, cf.
[1]. This problem
needs special discussion together with related problem of their gauge invariance. One more
open problem is connected with the great number of the generalized coordinates and momenta
involved in the approach discussed. Here the question arises if it is possible to reduce this number
without loosing the generality.

where M = ρm and there are is taken for account dynamic equation Dh = (h, ∇)v and identity

[M, (h, ∇)v]k + [(M, ∇)v, h]k = [M, h]k∂svs − [M, h]s∂kvs .

Introducing for brevity notation

Y = [m, H] ≡ [M, h],

we can represent the r.h.s. of Eq. (83) as

This proves Eq. (32).

namely

Let us check up now the integral relation (39). It is suﬃcient to prove the diﬀerential form,

where dΣ presents some inﬁnitesimal oriented area moving with the ﬂuid. It can be presented
in the form

where dl1, dl2 are frozen–in linear elements. Thus, dla, a = 1, 2, are invariants of the J type and
satisfy equations

D(M, dΣ) = (J, dΣ),

dΣ = [dl1, dl2],

D(dla) = (dla, ∇)v.

Consequently, from the recursion relation Eq. (60) it follows that ρdΣ is L- type invariant and
therefore is governed by dynamic equation of the form:

D(ρdΣ) = −∇(ρvdΣ) + [v, curl(ρdΣ)],

or in the coordinates,

D(ρdΣi) = −(ρdΣk)∂ivk .

Now it is easy to prove relation (85) without any restrictions for the type of ﬂow. Namely,

(85)

(86)

(87)

(88)

D(M, dΣ) = D(m, ρdΣ) = (Dm, ρdΣ) + miD(ρdΣi) =
= (ρdΣ, (m, ∇)v) + (J, dΣ) − miρdΣk∂ivk = (J, dΣ) .

In order to prove the helicity conservation, Eq. (74), let us consider some scalar quantity of

where J is frozen-in ﬁeld. Then, taking for account that Eq. (70) for the barotropic ﬂows can
be presented in the form

Y = (vhJ),

the form

we obtain

Dvh = −∇(χ − v2/2) − vhm · ∇vm , χ ≡

dp/ρ,

DY = (Dvh, J) + (vh, DJ) = −

For J = ωh/ρ we proceed

D(vh, ωh/ρ) = −ρ−1

Then

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

∂t(vh, ωh) = −divqh , qh = (χ − v2/2)ωh + v (vh, ωh)

(89)

that evidently coincides with Eq. (74).

It is noteworthy that the proof is valid for any J- type invariant if the ﬁeld ρJ is divergence–

∂t(ρJ, vh) = −divq , q = (χ − v2/2)ρJ + v (ρJ, vh)

for div(ρJ) = 0.

(90)

For instance, choosing J = h immediately leads to cross–helicity invariant if one takes for account
that (H, vh) = (H, v).

Numerical Study of Nearly Singular Solutions of the 3-D
Incompressible Euler Equations

Abstract

In this paper, we perform a careful numerical study of nearly singular solutions
of the 3D incompressible Euler equations with smooth initial data. We consider the
interaction of two perturbed antiparallel vortex tubes which was previously investigated
by Kerr in [14, 17]. In our numerical study, we use both the pseudo-spectral method
with the 2/3 dealiasing rule and the pseudo-spectral method with a high order Fourier
smoothing. Moreover, we perform a careful resolution study with grid points as large
as 1536 × 1024 × 3072 to demonstrate the convergence of both numerical methods.
Our computational results show that the maximum vorticity does not grow faster
than doubly exponential in time while the velocity ﬁeld remains bounded up to T =
19, beyond the singularity time T = 18.7 reported by Kerr in [14, 17]. The local
geometric regularity of vortex lines near the region of maximum vorticity seems to
play an important role in depleting the nonlinear vortex stretching dynamically.

1 Introduction

The question of whether the solution of the 3D incompressible Euler equations can develop a
ﬁnite time singularity from a smooth initial condition is one of the most challenging problems.
A major diﬃculty in obtaining the global regularity of the 3D Euler equations is due to the
presence of the vortex stretching, which is formally quadratic in vorticity. There have been
many computational eﬀorts in searching for ﬁnite time singularities of the 3D Euler and
Navier-Stokes equations, see e.g.
[5, 21, 18, 12, 22, 14, 4, 2, 10, 20, 11, 17]. Of particular
interest is the numerical study of the interaction of two perturbed antiparallel vortex tubes
by Kerr [14, 17], in which a ﬁnite time blowup of the 3D Euler equations was reported. There
has been a lot of interests in studying the interaction of two perturbed antiparallel vortex

tubes in the late eighties and early nineties because of the vortex reconnection phenomena
observed for the Navier-Stokes equations. While most studies indicated only exponential
growth in the maximum vorticity [21, 1, 3, 18, 19, 22], the work of Kerr and Hussain in
[18] suggested a ﬁnite time blow-up in the inﬁnite Reynolds number limit, which motivated
Kerr’s Euler computations mentioned above.

There has been some interesting development in the theoretical understanding of the 3D
incompressible Euler equations.
It has been shown that the local geometric regularity of
vortex lines can play an important role in depleting nonlinear vortex stretching [6, 7, 8, 9].
In particular, the recent results obtained by Deng, Hou, and Yu [8, 9] show that geometric
regularity of vortex lines, even in an extremely localized region containing the maximum
vorticity, can lead to depletion of nonlinear vortex stretching, thus avoiding ﬁnite time
singularity formation of the 3D Euler equations.

In a recent paper [13], we have performed well-resolved computations of the 3D incom-
pressible Euler equations using the same initial condition as the one used by Kerr in [14]. In
our computations, we use a pseudo-spectral method with a very high order Fourier smooth-
ing to discretise the 3D incompressible Euler equations. The time integration is performed
using the classical fourth order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time stepping to satisfy
the CFL stability condition. We use up to 1536 × 1024 × 3072 space resolution to resolve the
nearly singular behavior of the 3D Euler equations. Our computational results demonstrate
that the maximum vorticity does not grow faster than doubly exponential in time, up to
t = 19, beyond the singularity time t = 18.7 predicted by Kerr’s computations [14, 17]. More-
over, we show that the velocity ﬁeld, the enstrophy, and enstrophy production rate remain
bounded throughout the computations. This is in contrast to Kerr’s computations in which
the vorticity blows up like O((T − t)−1) and the velocity ﬁeld blows up like O((T − t)−1/2).
The vortex lines near the region of the maximum vorticity are found to be relatively smooth.
With the velocity ﬁeld being bounded, the non-blowup result of Deng-Hou-Yu [8, 9] can be
applied, which implies that there is no blowup of the Euler equations up to T = 19. The
local geometric regularity of the vortex lines near the region of maximum vorticity seems to
play an important role in the dynamic depletion of vortex stretching.

The purpose of this paper is to perform a systematic convergence study using two diﬀerent
numerical methods to further validate the computational results obtained in [13]. These
two methods are the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule and the pseudo-
spectral method with a high order Fourier smoothing. For the 3D Euler equations with
periodic boundary conditions, the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule has
been used widely in the computational ﬂuid dynamics community. This method has the
advantage of removing the aliasing errors completely. On the other hand, when the solution
is nearly singular, the decay of the Fourier spectrum is very slow. The abrupt cut-oﬀ of
the last 1/3 of its Fourier modes could generate signiﬁcant oscillations due to the Gibbs
phenomenon. In our computational study, we ﬁnd that the pseudo-spectral method with a
high order Fourier smoothing can alleviate this diﬃculty by applying a smooth cut-oﬀ at high
frequency modes. Moreover, we ﬁnd that by using a high order smoothing, we can retain
more eﬀective Fourier modes than the 2/3 dealiasing rule. This gives a better convergence
property. To demonstrate the convergence of both methods, we perform a careful resolution

2

study, both in the physical space and spectrum space. Our extensive convergence study
shows that both numerical methods converge to the same solution under mesh reﬁnement.
Moreover, we show that the pseudo-spectral method with a high order Fourier smoothing
oﬀers better accuracy than the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule.

To understand the diﬀerences between our computational results and those obtained by
Kerr in [14], we need to make some comparison between Kerr’s computations [14] and our
computations. In Kerr’s computations, he used a pseudo-spectral discretization with the 2/3
dealiasing rule in the x and y directions, and a Chebyshev discretization in the z-direction
with resolution of order 512 × 256 × 192.
In order to prepare the initial data that can
be used for the Chebyshev polynomials, Kerr performed some interpolation and used extra
ﬁltering. As noted by Kerr [14] (see the top paragraph of page 1729), “An eﬀect of the
initial ﬁlter upon the vorticity contours at t = 0 is a long tail in Fig. 2(a)” (see also Figure
2 of this paper). Such “a long tail” is clearly a numerical artifact. In comparison, since
we use pseudo-spectral approximations in all three directions, there is no need to perform
interpolation or use extra ﬁltering as was done in [14]. Our initial vorticity contours are
essentially symmetric (see Figure 1). There is no such “a long tail” in our initial vorticity
contours. It seems reasonable to expect that the “long tail” in Kerr’s discrete initial condition
could aﬀect his numerical solution at later times.

A more important diﬀerence between Kerr’s computations and our computations is the
diﬀerence between his numerical resolution and ours. From the numerical results presented
at t = 15 and t = 17 in [14], one can observe noticeable oscillations in the vorticity contours
(see Figure 4 of [14] or Figure 22 of this paper). By t = 17, the two vortex tubes have
eﬀectively turned into two thin vortex sheets which roll up at the left edge (see Figures 24
and 25 of this paper). The rolled up portion of the vortex sheet travels backward in time and
moves away from the dividing plane (the x − y plane). With only 192 Chebyshev grid points
along the z-direction in Kerr’s computations, there are not enough grid points to resolve the
rolled up portion of the vortex sheet, which is some distance away from the dividing plane.
The lack of resolution along the z-direction plus the Gibbs phenomenon due to the use of the
2/3 dealiasing rule in the x and y directions may contribute to the oscillations observed in
Kerr’s computations. In comparison, we have 3072 grid points along the z-direction, which
provide about 16 grid points across the singular layer at t = 18, and about 8 grid points at
t = 19 [13]. It is also worth mentioning that Kerr has only about 100 eﬀective Fourier modes
in the x and y directions (see Figure 18 of [14]), while we have about 1300 eﬀective Fourier
modes in |k| (see Figures 11 and 12 of this paper). The diﬀerence between our resolutions is
clearly signiﬁcant.

It is worth noting that the computations for t ≤ 17, which Kerr used as the primary
evidence for a singularity, is still far from the predicted singularity time, T = 18.7. With
the asymptotic scaling parameter being T − t = 1.7, the error in the singularity ﬁtting
In order to justify the predicted asymptotic behavior of vorticity
could be of order one.
and velocity blowup, one needs to perform well-resolved computations much closer to the
predicted singularity time. As our computations demonstrate, the alleged singularity scaling,
k~ωk∞ ≈ c/(T − t), does not persist in time (here ~ω is vorticity). If we take T = 18.7, as
suggested in [14], the scaling constant, c, does not remain constant as t → T . In fact, we

3

ﬁnd that c rapidly decays to zero as t → T (see Figure 20 of this paper).

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the set-up of the problem in
Section 2. In Section 3, we perform a systematic convergence study of the two numerical
methods. We describe our numerical results in detail and compare them with the previous
results obtained in [14, 17] in Section 4. Some concluding remarks are made in Section 5.

2 The set-up of the problem

The 3D incompressible Euler equations in the vorticity stream function formulation are given
as follows:

~ωt + (~u · ∇)~ω = ∇~u · ~ω,
− △ ~ψ = ~ω,

~u = ∇ × ~ψ,

(1)

(2)

with initial condition ~ω |t=0= ~ω0, where ~u is velocity, ~ω is vorticity, and ~ψ is stream function.
Vorticity is related to velocity by ~ω = ∇ × ~u. The incompressibility implies that

∇ · ~u = ∇ · ~ω = ∇ · ~ψ = 0.

We consider periodic boundary conditions with period 4π in all three directions.

We study the interaction of two perturbed antiparallel vortex tubes using the same initial
condition as that of Kerr (see Section III of [14]). Following [14], we call the x-y plane as
the “dividing plane” and the x-z plane as the “symmetry plane”. There is one vortex
tube above and below the dividing plane respectively. The term “antiparallel” refers to the
anti-symmetry of the vorticity with respect to the dividing plane in the following sense:
~ω(x, y, z) = −~ω(x, y, −z). Moreover, with respect to the symmetry plane, the vorticity is
symmetric in its y component and anti-symmetric in its x and z components. Thus we have
ωx(x, y, z) = −ωx(x, −y, z), ωy(x, y, z) = ωy(x, −y, z) and ωz(x, y, z) = −ωz(x, −y, z). Here
ωx, ωy, ωz are the x, y, and z components of vorticity respectively. These symmetries allow
us to compute only one quarter of the whole periodic cell.

A complete description of the initial condition is also given in [13]. There are a few
misprints in the analytic expression of the initial condition given in [14]. In our computations,
we use the corrected version of Kerr’s initial condition by comparing with Kerr’s Fortran
subroutine which was kindly provided to us by him. A list of corrections to these misprints
is given in the Appendix of [13].

We should point out that due to the diﬀerence between Kerr’s discretization strategies
and ours in solving the 3D Euler equations, there is some noticeable diﬀerence between
the discrete initial condition generated by Kerr’s discretization and the one generated by
our pseudo-spectral discretization. In [14], Kerr interpolated the initial condition from the
uniform grid to the Chebyshev grid along the z-direction and applied extra ﬁltering. This
interpolation and extra ﬁltering, which were not provided explicitly in [14], seem to introduce
some numerical artifact to Kerr’s discrete initial condition. According to [14] (see the top

paragraph of page 1729), “An eﬀect of the initial ﬁlter upon the vorticity contours at t = 0
is a long tail in Fig. 2(a)”. Since our computations are performed on a uniform grid
using the pseudo-spectral approximations in all three directions, we do not need to use any
interpolation To demonstrate this slight diﬀerence between Kerr’s discrete initial condition
and ours, we plot the initial vorticity contours along the symmetry plane in Figure 1 using
our spectral discretization in all three directions. As we can see, the initial vorticity contours
in Figure 1 are essentially symmetric. This is in contrast to the apparent asymmetry in Kerr’s
initial vorticity contours as illustrated by Figure 2, which is Fig. 2(a) of [14]. We also present
the 3D plot of the vortex tubes at t = 0 and t = 6 respectively in Figure 3. We can see
that the two initial vortex tubes are essentially symmetric. By time t = 6, there is already
a signiﬁcant ﬂattening near the center of the tubes.

We exploit the symmetry properties of the solution in our computations, and perform
our computations on only a quarter of the whole domain. Since the solution appears to
be most singular in the z direction, we allocate twice as many grid points along the z
direction than along the x direction. The solution is least singular in the y direction. We
allocate the smallest resolution in the y direction to reduce the computation cost. In our
computations, two typical ratios in the resolution along the x, y and z directions are 3 : 2 : 6
and 4 : 3 : 8. Our computations were carried out on the PC cluster LSSC-II in the Institute of
Computational Mathematics and Scientiﬁc/Engineering Computing of Chinese Academy of
Sciences and the Shenteng 6800 cluster in the Super Computing Center of Chinese Academy
of Sciences. The maximal memory consumption in our computations is about 120 GBytes.

3 Convergence study of the two numerical methods

We use two numerical methods to compute the 3D Euler equations. The ﬁrst method is
the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule. The second method is the pseudo-
spectral method with a high order Fourier smoothing. The only diﬀerence between these two
methods is in the way we perform the cut-oﬀ of the high frequency Fourier modes to control

derivative of v along the xj direction, vxj , by taking the discrete inverse Fourier transform
of ikjρ(2kj/Nj)bvk, where k = (k1, k2, k3) and ρ is a high frequency Fourier cut-oﬀ function.
Here kj is the wave number (|kj| 6 Nj/2) along the xj direction and Nj is the total number of
grid points along the xj direction. For the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing
rule, the cut-oﬀ function ρ is chosen such that ρ(x) = 1 if |x| ≤ 2/3, and ρ(x) = 0 if
2/3 < |x| ≤ 1. For the pseudo-spectral method with a high order smoothing, we choose the
cut-oﬀ function ρ to be a smooth function of the form ρ(x) ≡ exp(−α|x|m) with α = 36 and
m = 36. The time integration is performed using the classical fourth order Runge-Kutta
method. Adaptive time stepping is used to satisfy the CFL stability condition with CFL
number equal to π/4. We use a sequence of resolutions: 768 × 512 × 1536, 1024 × 768 × 2048,
and 1536 × 1024 × 3072, to demonstrate the convergence of our numerical computations.

3.1 Comparison of the two methods

It is interesting to make some comparison of the two spectral methods we use. First of all,
both methods are of spectral accuracy. The pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing
rule has been widely used in the computational ﬂuid dynamics community.
It has the
advantage of removing the aliasing error completely. On the other hand, when the solution
is nearly singular, the Fourier spectrum typically decays very slowly. By cutting oﬀ the last
1/3 of the high frequency modes along each direction abruptly, this can introduce oscillations
in the physical solution due to the Gibbs phenomenon. In this paper, we will provide solid
numerical evidences to demonstrate this eﬀect. On the other hand, the pseudo-spectral
method with the high order Fourier smoothing is designed to keep the majority of the
Fourier modes unchanged and remove the very high modes to avoid the aliasing error, see
Fig. 4 for the proﬁle of ρ(x). We choose α to be 36 to guarantee that ρ(2kj/Nj) reaches
the level of the round-oﬀ error (O(10−16)) at the highest modes. The order of smoothing,
m, is chosen to be 36 to optimize the accuracy of the spectral approximation, while still
keeping the aliasing error under control. As we can see from Figure 4, the eﬀective modes
in our computations are about 12 ∼ 15% more than those using the standard 2/3 dealiasing
rule. Retaining part of the eﬀective high frequency Fourier modes beyond the traditional
2/3 cut-oﬀ position is a special feature of the second method.

To compare the performance of the two methods, we perform a careful convergence study
for the two methods. In Figure 5, we compare the Fourier spectra of the enstrophy obtained
by using the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule with those obtained by
the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smoothing. For a ﬁxed resolution 768 ×
512 × 1536, we can see that the Fourier spectra obtained by the pseudo-spectral method

vertical line corresponds to the cut-oﬀ mode using the 2/3 dealiasing rule. We can see that
using this Fourier smoothing we keep about 12 ∼ 15% more modes than those using the 2/3
dealiasing rule.

with the high order smoothing retains more eﬀective Fourier modes than those obtained
by the spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule. This can be seen by comparing the
results with the corresponding computations using a higher resolution 1024 × 768 × 2048.
Moreover, the pseudo-spectral method with the high order Fourier smoothing does not give
the spurious oscillations in the Fourier spectra which are present in the computations using
the 2/3 dealiasing rule near the 2/3 cut-oﬀ point.

We perform further comparison of the two methods using the same resolution. In Figure
6, we plot the energy spectra computed by the two methods using resolution 768×512×1536.
We can see that there is almost no diﬀerence in the Fourier spectra generated by the two
methods in early times, t = 8, 10, when the solution is still relatively smooth. The diﬀerence
begins to show near the cut-oﬀ point when the Fourier spectra raise above the round-oﬀ
error level starting from t = 12. We can see that the spectra computed by the pseudo-
spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule introduces noticeable oscillations near the 2/3
cut-oﬀ point. The spectra computed by the pseudo-spectral method with the high order
smoothing, on the other hand, extend smoothly beyond the 2/3 cut-oﬀ point. As we see
from Figure 5, a signiﬁcant portion of those Fourier modes beyond the 2/3 cut-oﬀ position
are still accurate. In the next subsection, we will demonstrate by a careful resolution study
that the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smoothing indeed oﬀers better accuracy
than the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule.

Similar comparison can be made in the physical space for the velocity ﬁeld and the vor-
ticity. In Figure 7, we compare the maximum velocity as a function of time computed by
the two methods using resolution 768 × 512 × 1536. The two solutions are almost indis-
tinguishable. In Figure 8, we plot the maximum vorticity as a function of time. The two

solid lines are the enstrophy spectra with resolution 1024 × 768 × 2048 obtained using the
high order Fourier smoothing. The times for the spectra lines are at t = 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
respectively.

solutions agree very well up to t = 18. The solution obtained by the pseudo-spectral method
with the 2/3 dealiasing rule grows slower from t = 18 to t = 19. To understand why the
two solutions start to deviate from each other toward the end, we examine the contour plot
of the axial vorticity in Figures 9 and 10. As we can see, the vorticity computed by the
pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule already develops small oscillations at
t = 17. The oscillations grow bigger by t = 18. We note that the oscillations in the axial
vorticity contours concentrate near the region where the magnitude of vorticity is close to
zero. On the other hand, the solution computed by the spectral method with the high order
smoothing is still quite smooth.

3.2 Resolution study for the two methods

In this subsection, we perform a resolution study for the two numerical methods using a
sequence of resolutions. For the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smoothing, we
use the resolutions 768 × 512 × 1536, 1024 × 768 × 2048, and 1536 × 1024 × 3072 respectively.
Except for the computation on the largest resolution 1536×1024×3072, all computations are
carried out from t = 0 to t = 19. The computation on the ﬁnal resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072
is started from t = 10 with the initial condition given by the computation with the resolution
1024 × 768 × 2048. For the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule, we use the
resolutions 512 × 384 × 1024, 768 × 512 × 1536 and 1024 × 1024 × 2048 respectively. The
computations using the ﬁrst two resolutions are carried out from t = 0 to t = 19 while the

computation on the largest resolution 1024 × 1024 × 2048 is started at t = 15 with the initial
condition given by the computation with resolution 512 × 512 × 1024.

First, we perform a convergence study of the enstrophy and energy spectra for the pseudo-
spectral method with the high order smoothing at later times (from t = 16 to t = 19) using
two largest resolutions 1024 × 768 × 2048, and 1536 × 1024 × 3072. The results are given
in Figures 11 and 12 respectively. They clearly demonstrate the spectral convergence of the
spectral method with the high order smoothing.

To further demonstrate the accuracy of our computations, we compare the maximum
vorticity obtained by the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smoothing for three
diﬀerent resolutions: 768×512×1536, 1024×768×2048, and 1536×1024×3072 respectively.
The result is plotted in Figure 13. Two conclusions can be made from this resolution study.
First, by comparing Figure 13 with Figure 8, we can see that the pseudo-spectral method
with the high order smoothing is indeed more accurate than the pseudo-spectral method
with the 2/3 dealiasing rule for a given resolution. Secondly, the resolution 768 × 512 × 1536
is not good enough to resolve the nearly singular solution at later times. However, we observe
that the diﬀerence of the numerical solution obtained by the resolution 1024 × 768 × 2048
is very close to that obtained by the resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072. This indicates that the
vorticity is reasonably well-resolved by our largest resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072.

We have also performed a similar resolution study for the maximum velocity in Figure
14. The solutions obtained by the two largest resolutions are almost indistinguishable, which
suggests that the velocity is well-resolved by our largest resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072.

Next, we perform a similar resolution study for the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3
dealiasing rule. The results are very similar to the ones we have obtained for the pseudo-
spectral method with the high order smoothing. Here we just present a few representative

Figure 15: Convergence study for enstrophy spectra obtained by the pseudo-spectral method
with the 2/3 dealiasing rule using diﬀerent resolutions. The solid line is computed with
resolution 512 × 384 × 1024, the dashed line is computed with resolution 786 × 512 × 1536,
and the dashed-dotted line is computed with resolution 1024 × 1024 × 2048. The times for

to t = 18 using diﬀerent resolutions. The resolutions we use here are 512 × 384 × 1024,
786 × 512 × 1536, and 1024 × 1024 × 2048 respectively. If we compare the Fourier spectra
at t = 17 and t = 18 (the last two curves in Figure 15), we clearly observe convergence of
the enstrophy spectra as we increase our resolutions. On the other hand, the decay of the
enstrophy spectra becomes very slow at later times. The oscillations near the 2/3 cut-oﬀ
point become more and more pronounced as time increases. This abrupt cut-oﬀ of high
frequency spectra introduces some oscillations in the vorticity contours at later times.

To demonstrate that the two numerical methods converge to the same solution when the
solution is nearly singular, we compare the enstrophy spectra computed by the two numerical
methods at later times using the largest resolutions that we can aﬀord. For the pseudo-
spectral method with the high order smoothing, we use resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072. For
the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule, we use resolution 1024×1024×2048.
In Figure 16, we plot the enstrophy spectra for t = 17, 18, and 18.5 respectively. We observe
that the two methods give excellent agreement for those Fourier modes that are not aﬀected
by the high frequency cut-oﬀ. This shows that the two numerical methods converge to the
same solution with spectral accuracy.

We have performed a similar convergence study for the pseudo-spectral method with the
2/3 dealiasing in the physical space for the maximum vorticity. The result is given in Figure
17. As we can see, the computation with a higher resolution gives faster growth in the
maximum vorticity. This is also what we observed earlier for the pseudo-spectral method
with the high order smoothing. As we will see in the next section, the maximum vorticity
grows almost like doubly exponential in time. To capture this rapid dynamic growth of

respectively.

maximum vorticity, we must have suﬃcient resolution to resolve the nearly singular solution
of the Euler equations at later times.

The resolution study given by Figure 17 suggests that the maximum vorticity is reason-
ably resolved by resolution 768 × 512 × 1536 before t = 18. It is interesting to note that at
t = 17, small oscillations have already appeared in the vorticity contours in the region where
the magnitude of vorticity is small, see Figure 9. Apparently, the small oscillations in the
region where the vorticity is close to zero in magnitude have not yet polluted the accuracy
of the maximum vorticity in a signiﬁcant way. Note that there is no oscillation developed in
the vorticity contours obtained by the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smooth-
ing at this time. From Figure 8, we know that the maximum vorticity computed by the
two methods agrees reasonably well with each other before t = 18. This shows that the
two methods can still approximate the maximum vorticity reasonably well with resolution
768 × 512 × 1536 before t = 18.

The resolution study given by Figure 17 also suggests that the the computation obtained
by the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule using resolution 768 × 512 × 1536
is signiﬁcantly under-resolved after t = 18. This is also supported by the appearance of the
relatively large oscillations in the vorticity contours at t = 18 from Figure 10. It is interesting
to note from Figure 8 that the computational results obtained by the two methods with
resolution 768 × 512 × 1536 begin to deviate from each other precisely around t = 18. By
comparing the result from Figure 8 with that from Figure 17, we conﬁrm again that for a
given resolution, the pseudo-spectral method with the high order smoothing gives a more
accurate approximation than the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule.

4 Analysis of computational results

In this section, we will present a series of numerical results to reveal the nature of the nearly
singular solution of the 3D Euler equations, and compare our results with those obtained by
Kerr in [14, 17]. Based on the convergence study we have performed in the previous section,
we will present only those numerical results which are computed by the pseudo-spectral
method with the high order smoothing using the largest resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072.

4.1 Review of Kerr’s results

In [14], Kerr presented numerical evidence which suggested a ﬁnite time singularity of the
3D Euler equations for two perturbed antiparallel vortex tubes. He used a pseudo-spectral
discretization in the x and y directions, and a Chebyshev method in the z direction with
resolution of order 512 × 256 × 192. His computations showed that the growth of the peak
vorticity, the peak axial strain, and the enstrophy production obey (T − t)−1 with T = 18.9.
Kerr stated in his paper [14] (see page 1727) that his numerical results shown after t = 17
and up to t = 18 were “not part of the primary evidence for a singularity” due to the lack
of suﬃcient numerical resolution and the presence of noise in the numerical solutions. In
his recent paper [17] (see also [15, 16]), Kerr applied a high wave number ﬁlter to the data
obtained in his original computations to “remove the noise that masked the structures in
earlier graphics” presented in [14]. With this ﬁltered solution, he presented some scaling
analysis of the numerical solutions up to t = 17.5. The velocity ﬁeld was shown to blow up
like O((T − t)−1/2) with T being revised to T = 18.7.

take c1 = 1/8.128, c2 = 1/23.24 to match the same starting value for all three plots.

4.2 Maximum vorticity growth

From the resolution study we present in Figure 13, we ﬁnd that the maximum vorticity
increases rapidly from the initial value of 0.669 to 23.46 at the ﬁnal time t = 19, a factor of
35 increase from its initial value. Kerr’s computations predicted a ﬁnite time singularity at
T = 18.7. Our computations show no sign of ﬁnite time blowup of the 3D Euler equations
up to T = 19, beyond the singularity time predicted by Kerr. We use three diﬀerent
resolutions, i.e. 768 × 512 × 1536, 1024 × 768 × 2048, and 1536 × 1024 × 3072 respectively in
our computations. As we can see, the agreement between the two successive resolutions is
very good with only mild disagreement toward the end of the computations. This indicates
that a very high space resolution is indeed needed to capture the rapid growth of maximum
vorticity at the later stage of the computations.

In order to understand the nature of the dynamic growth in vorticity, we examine the
In Figure 18, we plot the quantity,

kξ · ∇~u · ~ωk∞, as a function of time, where ξ is the unit vorticity vector. If the maximum
vorticity indeed blew up like O((T − t)−1), as alleged in [14], this quantity should have been
quadratic as a function of maximum vorticity. We ﬁnd that there is tremendous cancellation
in this vortex stretching term. It actually grows slower than Ck~ωk∞ log(k~ωk∞), see Figure
18. It is easy to show that such weak nonlinearity in vortex stretching would imply only
doubly exponential growth in the maximum vorticity. Indeed, as demonstrated by Figure
19, the maximum vorticity does not grow faster than doubly exponential in time. In fact,
the growth slows down toward the end of the computation, which indicates that there is
stronger cancellation taking place in the vortex stretching term.

We remark that for vorticity that grows as rapidly as doubly exponential in time, one
may be tempted to ﬁt the maximum vorticity growth by c/(T − t) for some T . Indeed, if we

choose T = 18.7 as suggested by Kerr in [17], we ﬁnd a reasonably good ﬁt for the maximum
vorticity as a function of c/(T − t) for the period 15 ≤ t ≤ 17. We plot the scaling constant
c in Figure 20. As we can see, c is close to a constant for 15 ≤ t ≤ 17. To conclude that the
3D Euler equations indeed develop a ﬁnite time singularity, one must demonstrate that such
scaling persists as t approaches to T . As we can see from Figure 20, the scaling constant c
decreases rapidly to zero as t approaches to the alleged singularity time T . Therefore, the
ﬁtting of k~ωk∞ ≈ O((T − t)−1) is not correct asymptotically.

4.3 Velocity proﬁle

One of the important ﬁndings of our computations is that the velocity ﬁeld is actually
bounded by 1/2 up to T = 19. This is in contrast to Kerr’s computations in which the
maximum velocity was shown to blow up like O((T − t)−1/2) [15, 17]. We plot the maximum
velocity as a function of time using diﬀerent resolutions in Figure 14. The computation
obtained by resolution 1024×768×2048 and the one obtained by resolution 1536×1024×3072
are almost indistinguishable. The fact that the velocity ﬁeld is bounded is signiﬁcant. With
the velocity ﬁeld being bounded, the non-blowup theory of Deng-Hou-Yu [8] can be applied,
which implies non-blowup of the 3D Euler equations up to T . We refer to [13] for more
discussions.

4.4 Local vorticity structure

In this subsection, we would like to examine the local vorticity structure near the region of the
maximum vorticity. To illustrate the development in the symmetry plane, we show a series of
vorticity contours near the region of the maximum vorticity at late times in a manner similar
to the results presented in [14]. For some reason, Kerr scaled his axial vorticity contours by

a factor of 5 along the z-direction. Noticeable oscillations already develop in Kerr’s axial
vorticity contours at t = 15 and t = 17, see Figure 22. To compare with Kerr’s results, we
scale the vorticity contours in the x − z plane by a factor of 5 in the z-direction. The results
at t = 15 and t = 17 are plotted in Figure 21. The results are in qualitative agreement with
Kerr’s results, except that our computations are better resolved and do not suﬀer from the
noise and oscillations which are present in Kerr’s vorticity contours.

In order to see better the dynamic development of the local vortex structure, we plot a
sequence of vorticity contours on the symmetry plane at t = 17.5, 18, 18.5, and 19 respectively
in Figure 23. The pictures are plotted using the original length scales, without the scaling
by a factor of 5 in the z direction as in Figure 21. From these results, we can see that the
vortex sheet is compressed in the z direction. It is clear that a thin layer (or a vortex sheet)
is formed dynamically. The head of the vortex sheet begins to roll up around t = 16. Here
the head of the vortex sheet refers to the region extending above the vorticity peak just
behind the leading edge of the vortex sheet [14]. By the time t = 19, the head of the vortex
sheet has traveled backward for quite a distance and away from the dividing plane. The
vortex sheet has been compressed quite strongly along the z-direction. In order to resolve
this nearly singular layer structure, we use 3072 grid points along the z-direction, which
gives about 16 grid points across the layer at t = 18 and about 8 grid points across the layer
at t = 19. In comparison, the 192 Chebyshev grid points along the z-direction in Kerr’s
computations would not be suﬃcient to resolve the rolled-up portion of the vortex sheet.

We also plot the isosurface of vorticity near the region of the maximum vorticity in
Figures 24 and 25 to illustrate the dynamic roll-up of the vortex sheet near the region of the
maximum vorticity. The isosurface of vorticity in Figure 24 is set at 0.6 × k~ωk∞. Figure 24
gives the local vorticity structure at t = 17. If we scale the local roll-up region on the left
hand side next to the box by a factor of 4 along the z direction, as was done in [17], we would
obtain a local roll-up structure which is qualitatively similar to Figure 1 in [17]. In Figure

with Figure 4 in [14].

25, we show the local vorticity structure for t = 18 and t = 19. In both ﬁgures, the isosurface
is set at 0.5 × k~ωk∞. We can see that the vortex sheets have rolled up and traveled backward
in time away from the dividing plane. Moreover, we observe that the vortex lines near the
region of maximum vorticity are relatively straight and the unit vorticity vectors seem to be
quite regular. On the other hand, the inner region containing the maximum vorticity does
not seem to shrink to zero at a rate of (T − t)1/2, as predicted in [17]. The length and the
width of the vortex sheet are still O(1), although the thickness of the vortex sheet becomes
quite small.

Another interesting question is how the vorticity vector aligns with the eigenvectors of
(∇~u + ∇T ~u). In Table 1, we document
the deformation tensor, which is deﬁned as M ≡
the alignment information of the vorticity vector around the point of maximum vorticity
with resolution 1536 × 1024 × 3072. In this table, λi (i = 1, 2, 3) is the i-th eigenvalue of
M, θi is the angle between the i-th eigenvector of M and the vorticity vector. One can see
clearly that for 16 ≤ t ≤ 19 the vorticity vector at the point of maximum vorticity is almost
perfectly aligned with the second eigenvector of M. The angle between the vorticity vector
and the second eigenvector is very small throughout this time interval. Note that the second
eigenvalue, λ2, is positive and is about 20 times smaller in magnitude than the largest and
the smallest eigenvalues. This dynamic alignment of the vorticity vector with the second
eigenvector of the deformation tensor is another indication that there is a dynamic depletion
of vortex stretching.

5 Concluding Remarks

We investigate the interaction of two perturbed vortex tubes for the 3D Euler equations using
Kerr’s initial condition [14]. We use both the pseudo-spectral method with the standard 2/3
dealiasing rule and the pseudo-spectral method with a 36th order Fourier smoothing. We
perform a careful resolution study to demonstrate the convergence of both methods. Our
numerical computations demonstrate that while both methods converge to the same solution
under resolution study, the pseudo-spectral method with the 36th order Fourier smoothing
oﬀers better computational accuracy for a given resolution. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the
pseudo-spectral method with the 36th order Fourier smoothing is more eﬀective in reducing
the numerical oscillations due to the Gibbs phenomenon while still keeping the aliasing error
under control.

Our numerical study indicates that there is a very subtle dynamic depletion of vortex
stretching. The maximum vorticity is shown to grow no faster than doubly exponential in
time up to T = 19, beyond the singularity time predicted by Kerr in [14]. The velocity ﬁeld
is shown to be bounded throughout the computations. Vortex lines near the region of the
maximum vorticity are quite regular. We provide numerical evidence that the vortex stretch-
ing term is only weakly nonlinear and is bounded by k~ωk∞ log(k~ωk∞). This implies that
there is tremendous dynamic cancellation in the nonlinear vortex stretching term. With the
velocity ﬁeld being bounded and the vortex lines being regular near the region of the maxi-
mum vorticity, the non-blowup conditions of Deng-Hou-Yu [8] are satisﬁed. This provides a
theoretical support for our computational results and sheds some light to our understanding
of the dynamic depletion of vortex stretching.

Finally, we would like to mention that we have carried out a rigorous convergence study
of the two numerical methods we consider in this paper for the one-dimensional Burgers
equation. The Burgers equation shares some essential numerical diﬃculties with the the 3D
Euler equations that we consider here. It has the same type of quadratic nonlinearity in the

24

convection term and it is known that it can form a shock singularity in a ﬁnite time. An
important advantage of the Burgers equation is that we have an analytic solution formula
which can be solved numerically up to the machine precision by using the Newton iterative
method. Using this semi-analytical solution, we have computed the solution very close to
the shock singularity time and documented the errors of both numerical methods using very
large resolutions. The computational results we obtain on the Burgers equation completely
support the convergence study of the two numerical methods for the 3D Euler equations
that we present in this paper. The performance of these two numerical methods and their
convergence property for the 1D Burgers equation are basically the same as those for the 3D
Euler equations. The detail of this result will be reported elsewhere.

Abstract

Evolution equations for the orientation distribution of axisymmetric particles in pe-

riodic ﬂows are derived in the regime of small but non-zero Brownian rotations. The

equations are based on a multiple time scale approach that allows fast computation of the

relaxation processes leading to statistical equilibrium. The approach has been applied to

the calculation of the eﬀective viscosity of a thin disk suspension in gravity waves.

I. Introduction

The rheological properties of a suspension will depend, when the particles are non-

spherical, on the orientation taken by the particles in response to the external ﬂow. For a

few particle shapes (e.g. the case of the ellipsoid [1]), equations for the rotation dynamics

exist in closed form, and it is possible to determine the orientation distribution of the

particles in suspension in the given ﬂow. However, unless a mechanism for the achievement

of a statistical equilibrium is introduced, the orientation distribution will depend on the

state in which the suspension is prepared initially. In the case of microscopic particles, one

such mechanism is provided by Brownian rotations [2]. It is still unclear whether inertia

and interaction with other particles may contribute to the equilibration mechanism.

An equilibrium distribution could be achieved alternatively by the presence of chaos in

the rotation dynamics; unfortunately, the importance of chaos turns out to be small in most

situations. In the case of a simple shear and axisymmetric particles, the particle motion

is periodic. This motion becomes aperiodic in the case of a time-dependent ﬂow, but

remains non-chaotic for axisymmetric particles [3]. Chaos arises in the motion of a triaxial

ellipsoids in a simple shear [4], but, depending on the axis ratios, large domains of initial

conditions remain associated with regular orbits and to the absence of a uniquely deﬁned

equilibrium distribution. Furthermore, for weak Brownian motion, the regular regions

will act as attractors for the chaotic orbits and will provide the bulk of the orientation

distribution.

The equilibrium orientation distribution of a Brownian particle has been determined

in various important limit regimes. The case of strong Brownian rotation was considered

by Burgers [5] leading to an orientation distribution that in ﬁrst approximation can be

considered isotropic. More interesting is the case of weak Brownian motion, in which

the form of the equilibrium distribution is determined by the structure of the orbits in

orientation space, which in turn depends on the imposed ﬂow.

A technique for the determination of the equilibrium distribution of weakly Brownian

particles, based on singular perturbation analysis of the diﬀusion equation in orientation

space, was derived in [6] for the case of axisysmmetric particles in a simple shear.

In

the present paper, an alternative approach will be presented, based on the perturbative

determination of the orbits in orientation space. This approach which will appear to be

2

appropriate in the case the ﬂow is time-dependent and, more in general, when analytical

expressions for the unperturbed orbits are not available. For the sake of deﬁniteness, the

dynamics of a small disk in the ﬁeld of a gravity wave will be considered, a problem with

application in polar seas, where wave propagation is aﬀected by the presence of ice crystals

in suspension (frazil ice) [7, 8].

II. Unperturbed dynamics

Indicating by k and ω the wavevector and the frequency of the wave, and with h the

water depth, the velocity ﬁeld of a small amplitude gravity wave will have the form:

U1 =
U2 =

U [e−kx2 + αekx2] sin(kx1 − ωt)
U [e−kx2 − αekx2] cos(kx1 − ωt)
e
e

where α = exp(−2kh) and x2 = 0 and x2 = h correspond respectively to the water surface

and to the bottom of the basin. Due to the potential nature of the ﬂow, the particle in

suspension will see a time-dependent (periodic) pure strain ﬁeld. It is convenient to carry

on the calculations in the reference frame rotating with frequency ω/2 around the x3-axis.
U /ω ≪ k−1

For small amplitude waves, the particle motion is conﬁned to a region of width

and kx2 can be approximated as constant. A particle initially near the water surface at
x1 = 0 will thus experience the strain ﬁeld E = ∇U + (∇U)T, with components in the

e

rotating frame, from Eq. (1):

E = k

U

(cid:18)

1 + α cos 2ωt,

−α sin 2ωt
−α sin 2ωt, −1 − α cos 2ωt

(cid:19)

Thus, for deep gravity waves α = 0 and E would be a constant strain ﬁeld rotating around

e

the x3-axis with frequency ω/2.

In this reference frame, an additional vorticity ﬁeld is

(cid:19)

This is a kind of time-dependent planar ﬂow, of the kind described in [3], which is known

to produce aperiodic behaviors in the particle orientation dynamics.

The motion of a revolution ellipsoid, with symmetry axis identiﬁed by the versor p,

in the presence of the strain and vorticity ﬁelds E and Ω, is described by the Jeﬀery’s

produced:

ratio r = a/b, where a and b are respectively along and perpendicular to the symmetry

Introducing polar coordinates (see Fig. 1), and normalizing time and vorticity with the

strain strength e = k

U : ω → −ω/2Ge and t → −Get, Jeﬀery’s Eq. (4), using Eqs. (3)

and (4), will take the form:

β′(ψ, t) ≡ ∂ψb(ψ, t) = 2[sin 2ωt + α sin(4ωt + 2ψ)]

(cid:26)

Following [3], the orbits can be classiﬁed studying the Poincare map Pn( ¯ψ) = mod(ψ(nT | ¯ψ),
2ω the period of β, where ψ(t| ¯ψ) obeys the ﬁrst of Eq. (5) with ψ(0| ¯ψ) = ¯ψ.

It is possible to see from the ﬁrst of Eq. (5) and (6) that the following relation holds:

and therefore the Poincare map is symmetric under the double reﬂection {ψ, Pn} → {π −

ψ, π − Pn} (see Fig. 2).

A periodic ψ will be associated with a ﬁxed point in the Poincare map and will cor-

respond to coherent orientation of the particles. As it is clear in the case of deep gravity

that P−n(π − ψ) = π − Pn(ψ) and therefore the plot is symmetric under reﬂection across
the diagonal line Pn = π − ψ.

waves [9], this regime is produced by the aligning eﬀect of strain on the particle dynamics.
It was noted in [3] that a stable ﬁxed point for ψ implies a value of β′ < 0 negative on

the average along the orbit, and, from the second of Eq. (5), an associated ﬁxed point

θ = π/2. As can be seen in Fig 3a, this ﬁxed point is located at ψ > π/2. The equilib-
rium orientation distribution will be given by the ﬁxed points of Pn( ¯ψ), with the eﬀect of
Brownian rotations disappearing in the zero noise limit.

The alternative regime, corresponding to random particle orientation, is associated with

|ψ(nT )| increasing monotonously with n, with Pn(ψ) generally aperiodic. In this case, from
continuity of ψ(t| ¯ψ), Pn( ¯ψ) will be topologically equivalent to an irrational rotation, and
the sequence Pn( ¯ψ) originating from a single ¯ψ will ﬁll densely the interval [0, π]. An
it is possible to calculate averages over ψ as time
ergodic property is then satisﬁed, i.e.
averages. Furthermore, from Poincare recurrence, the Pn( ¯ψ) sequence will come arbitrarily
close to the initial condition for some n. Hence statistical averages can be approximated
by time averages over a periodic orbit. Notice also that, from the symmetry of Pn( ¯ψ)
described in Eq. (7) and Figs. 2 and 3b, if, for certain n and ¯ψ0 < π/2 |Pn( ¯ψ0) − ¯ψ0| ≃ 0,

Figure 3: Poincare map for the coherent orientation (a) and the random orientation regime
(b) of an oblate ellipsoid in a shallow water wave with kh = 0.5. Notice in case (a) the
stable ﬁxed point at ψ > π/2 and the unstable one at ψ < π/2. With prolate ellipsoids,
the ﬁxed points would have been exchanged. The value of n in the random orientation
case has been chosen to lead to approximately closed orbits. Notice that ψ = π/2 remains
the best approximation to a ﬁxed point (i.e. a closed orbit of period nT ).

then, for the same n, |Pn( ¯ψ) − ¯ψ| ≃ 0 ∀ ¯ψ ∈ [ ¯ψ0, π − ¯ψ0].

Turning to the polar angle, if the orbit in ψ approximately closes, also c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) will
come arbitrarily close to the initial condition c(0|¯c, ¯ψ) = ¯c. Hence, to identify orbits that
are almost closed, it is suﬃcient to look for recurrence of the Poincare map Pn( ¯ψ). To see
why this property holds, notice that

c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) = ¯c exp

which will coincide with ¯c when the diﬀerence

ψ(nT | ¯ψ) − ¯ψ = −nωT +

β(ψ(t| ¯ψ), t)dt

is constant with respect to ¯ψ, i.e. ∂ ¯
ψ[ψ(nT | ¯ψ) − ¯ψ] ≃ 0. But, if Pn( ¯ψ0) − ¯ψ0 ≃ 0 for some
¯ψ0 < π/2, we have seen that |Pn( ¯ψ) − ¯ψ| ≃ 0 ∀ ¯ψ ∈ [ ¯ψ0, π − ¯ψ0] and ψ(nT | ¯ψ) − ¯ψ is
approximately constant in the interval. Hence |c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) − ¯c| ≃ 0 as requested.

III. The eﬀect of noise

The fact that the orbits close when, for appropriate values of n Pn( ¯ψ) ≃ ¯ψ, has the
consequence that these orbits can be labelled by the value c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) ≃ ¯c taken by tan θ

at their starting point. As in the time independent case described in [6], the particle

orientation distribution will receive a contribution from the motion along a single Jeﬀery

trajectory and one from the distribution of the trajectories, i.e. the distribution of c at
the recurrent points ti = niT i = 1, 2, ... where c(ti|¯c, ¯ψ) ≃ ¯c. If Brownian rotations were
strictly zero, the PDF (probability distribution function) ρ(c, t) would be itself recurrent

at the times ti: ρ(c, ti) = ρ(c, 0) and no equilibrium PDF would exist.

In the case of weak Brownian motion, an equilibrium distribution for ¯c exists and
is obtained studying the noise produced deviation of c(t|¯c, ¯ψ) away from ¯c at the times

ti = niT , at which the unperturbed Jeﬀery’s orbits would approximately close.

Accounting for the eﬀect of Brownian rotations, the Jeﬀery’s equations will read (see

The deviation of c(t|¯c, ¯ψ) away from ¯c will then be determined by the correction {ψ(nT | ¯ψ)−
ψ0(nT | ¯ψ), c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) − c0(nT |¯c, ¯ψ)}, where {ψ0, c0} is the unperturbed orbit obeying Eq.

with β0 = β(ψ0, t) and similarly for β′

as an expansions in powers of D1/2: ψ = ψ0 + ψ1/2 + ψ1 + ... and similarly for c, with the
initial condition ψk(0) = ck(0) = 0 for k > 0. The lowest order correction is obtained from

and lead to a diﬀusion contribution to the deviation. To obtain the drift contributions, it

is necessary to consider the next order in the expansion of Eq. (8), and the result is:

The lowest order contributions to diﬀusion and drift are therefore both O(D), as they

should. Some simpliﬁcations of Eqs. (13-14) are still possible and are illustrated in Ap-

pendix A.

What needs to be done at this point is to extract from the deviation {ψ(nT | ¯ψ) −
ψ0(nT | ¯ψ), c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ) − c0(nT |¯c, ¯ψ)}, that part associated with percolation between Jef-

fery’s orbits. It is then necessary to subtract the deviation component along the unper-

turbed orbit, which is associated with the noisy orbit not closing exactly at the recur-

rence time nT . The necessary operation is illustrated in Fig. 4, and it is assumed that
the orbits can be parameterized locally with ψ ≡ ψ(t| ¯ψ) (this is possible if ¯ψ is cho-

sen away from turning points). The perturbed trajectory at t = nT has reached the point
y = {ψ(nT | ¯ψ), c(nT |¯c, ¯ψ)}, while the unperturbed one is at the same instant in w = { ¯ψ, ¯c}.
It is then necessary to follow the perturbed trajectory from y to w = { ¯ψ, ¯c + ˆc}.

To O(D), the correction ˆc is obtained from the equation

ˆc = c1/2 + c1 − ˜c − (c1/2 − ˜c)cψcψ1/2

where ¯c + ˜c is the coordinate on the unperturbed orbit at ψ(nT | ¯ψ) ≃ ¯ψ + ψ1/2 + ψ1 and is
given by

while the piece (c1/2 − ˜c)cψcψ1/2 is due to deviation between orbits passing at diﬀerent c’s.

Using the relation hψ1/2c1/2i = −c0hψ1i (see Appendix B), from Eqs. (15-16), the following

IV. Determination of the orientation distribution

The quantities hˆc2i and hˆci allow to determine the deviation of c = tan θ from the initial

condition ¯c, at the recurrence times ti = niT . Both quantities are obtained from integrals

along the orbits, and, for ni large enough, it is expected that an averaging process takes
place, so that the ratios hˆc2i/ti and hˆci/ti tend to a limit. In Fig. 5 it is shown that this
is indeed the case also for relatively large values of the tollerance ǫ, identifying recurrence
through the condition |Pn( ¯ψ) − ¯ψ| < ǫ. It is then possible to consider a slow time scale ¯t
where the recurrence times ti are treated as continuous and it is possible to introduce a
Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF ρ(¯c, ¯t) [10]:

Figure 6: Comparison of the PDF ρ(¯c) calculated using for ¯a and ¯D diﬀerent values of ti
[see Eq. (21)]. Values of the parameters: ω = 1.4, kh = ∞, ¯ψ = 0. Heavy line: ti = 3T
ǫ = 0.4; stars: ti = 20T , ǫ = 0.1; thin line: Leal & Hinch theory [6].

[6], the fact that both ¯a and ¯D depend linearly in D implies that the equilibrium PDF is

independent of the noise amplitude. Statistical equilibrium will be achieved on the time
scale D−1. It is then necessary for the approach to be meaningful that the ti used to deﬁne
¯a and ¯D satisfy Dti ≪ 1.

Actually, excellent convergence is obtained already for ti rather small; in the case of Fig.

6, at ti = 20T , corresponding to ǫ = 0.1. Notice that this is the deep water wave regime

considered in [9], which, as it is clear from Eqs. (2-4), can be mapped to a constant simple

shear by a redeﬁnition of the eccentricity G; the PDF ρ(¯c) can then be compared with

the analytical result from the theory of Leal and Hinch [6]. [In this case, the aperiodicity

originates not from the dynamics, but from the sampling time T and the period of the
orbit (ω2 − 1)− 1
give indistinguishable results already for ti = 20T , ǫ = 0.1. Similar convergence to the

2 being incommensurate]. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the two approaches

limit result is observed in the shallow water regime, in which comparison with the theory

of Leal and Hinch is not possible.

Knowledge of the PDF ρ(¯c) allows determination of the eﬀective viscosity of a dilute

disk suspension in the ﬁeld of a wave. The viscous stress for a suspension of axisymmetric

ellipsoids reads [6, 11], indicating with µ and Φ, respectively, the solvent viscosity and the

11

suspended phase volume fraction:

σ = 2µE + 2µΦ{2Ahppppi : E + 2B[hppi · E + E · hppi] + CE}

(22)

where, in the present time dependent situation, the averages are intended over orientation

and time. The coeﬃcients A − C depend on the particle geometry: [6, 9]:

where K is called the reduced viscosity. Expressing the versor p in function of the angles

ψ and θ, and using Eqs. (22) and (23):

K = Ahsin4 θ sin2 2ψi + 2Bhsin2 θi + C

As in [6], the average over orientation is split into parts along and transverse to the orbit.

In the present situation, however, evaluation of the average along the orbit is slightly more

delicate than in the time-independent case. At a generic time t the average of a function

f (ψ, c) will be:

hf i(t) =

d¯c ρ(¯c)f (ψ(t + iT | ¯ψ), c(t + iT |¯c, ¯ψ))

with high amplitude waves corresponding to small values of the normalized frequency ω.

The reduced viscosity has been calculated in this range from Eq. (24), ﬁxing θ = π/2 and

integrating the equation for ψ with initial condition at the ﬁxed point.

V. Conclusions

The numerical evaluation of the rheological properties of a suspension of particles that

are weakly Brownian is faced with diﬃculties associated with the long integration times

necessary to achieve statistical equilibrium. Analytical techniques for the calculation of

the cumulative eﬀect of the Brownian noise on the dynamics are therefore necessary. The

technique presented in this paper can be seen as a multiple time scale analysis [12] in which

the stochastic dynamics is pushed to the slow scale, while the local strain and vorticity

are treated as fast variables. For the periodic ﬂows considered in this paper, the eﬀective

drift and diﬀusivity coeﬃcients are obtained integrating the fast dynamics over a single

periodic orbit approximating the particle orientation dynamics. Slow variations would

be accounted for, sampling the approximate periodic orbits in appropriate way along the

13

particle trajectories, and would lead to eﬀective drift and diﬀusivity coeﬃcients depending

on the slow time. Once the eﬀective drift and diﬀusivity were available, a Monte Carlo,

for the determination of the rheological properties of a suspension, would be carried on at

the slow time scale. [In the gravity wave example of this paper, this would be associated

with integration of the Fokker-Planck equation (20)],

Application of these techniques to the dynamics of a thin disk suspension in gravity

waves, has shown that qualitative behaviors observed in the deep water case [9] are pre-

served in the shallow water regime. Precisely, a transition from a coherent rotation regime

for large amplitude waves to a random orientation one, characterized by a deep minimum

in the medium eﬀective viscosity.

A natural extension of the techniques illustrated could be the treatment of higher

numbers of degrees of freedom. The most immediate example is the triaxial ellipsoid in

a simple shear considered in [4]. In this case, the angle θ would be replaced by the pair

{θ, φ} with φ the rotation around the axis p. An analysis in the whole phase domain would

require, however, consideration of the transition region from the regular orbits, in which

diﬀusion is dominated by Brownian rotation, to the chaos dominated stochastic region. It

is expected that the transition be signalled by the breakup of linear scaling in time for the

drift and diﬀusion across orbits.

Appendix A. Noise term determination

The noise term to add in the Jeﬀery’s equations (5) can be obtained directly from the

diﬀusion equation obeyed for zero ﬂow by the orientation PDF in the variables {ψ, c}.

Alternatively, one may consider the diﬀusion operator in the variables {ψ, θ}:

∇2 =

1
sin2 θ

∂2
∂ψ2 +

sin θ

and determine the stochastic process leading to the Fokker-Planck equation ∇2ρ(ψ, θ) = 0
[which has the isotropic solution ρ(ψ, θ) = 1

2π sin θ]. One ﬁnds the increments for ψ and θ

14

produced by Brownian rotation in the time interval dt [10]:

dψ = | sin θ|−1dWψ,

dθ =

cot θdt + dWθ

where dWk, k = ψ, θ are the Brownian increments

hdWki = 0,

hdWjdWki = δjkdt

Changing then variables from θ to c and using Itˆo’s lemma, one ﬁnds:

dθ2 =
and expressing also sin θ = c(1 + c2)−1/2 in dψ, Eq. (8) is ﬁnally obtained.

Appendix B. Alternative form of the perturbed orbit equations

Equations (13-14) can be simpliﬁed, and the singularity in θ = 0 produced by the noise

term in the ﬁrst of Eq. (8) eliminated, by the change of variables:

y1 = c2

0hψ2

1/2i,

y2 = c0hψ1/2c1/2i,

y3 = hc2

1/2i,

y4 = c0hc1i,

y5 = c2

0hψ1i

In the new variables, Eqs. (13-14) take the form:

0y1 + D˜g

˙y1 = β′
˙y2 = 2β0y1
˙y3 = 4β0y2 − β′
˙y4 = −β′
˙y5 = −2β0y1

0y3 + D˜h
0y4 + 2β0y2 + β′






0y1 + 2β0y5 + D ˜f

where, from Eq. (10), ˜g = 1 + c2

0, ˜h = (1 + c2

0)2 and ˜f = (1 + c2

0)( 1

2 + c2

0). Comparing the

equations for y2 and y5, one sees that, thanks to the initial condition yk(0) = 0, y2 = −y7

and then hψ1/2c1/2i = −c0hψ1i; thus the equation for hψ1i can be eliminated from (14).

Equation (B1) can then be further simpliﬁed to:

(B1)

(B2)

0y1 + D˜g

˙y1 = β′
˙y2 = 2β0y1

˙y3 = 4β0y2 − β′

0y4 + β′
˙y4 = −β′

An upper bound on the mixing eﬃciency is derived for a passive scalar under the inﬂuence of
advection and diﬀusion with a body source. The mixing eﬃciency is deﬁned as the the ratio of
the source variance to the ﬂuctuations in the scalar concentration, divided by the root-mean-square
intensity of the velocity ﬁeld. The bound depends only on the functional “shape” of both the source
and the advecting ﬁeld. Direct numerical simulations performed for a simple advecting ﬂow to test
the bounds are reported. The bounds are found to be relatively sharp for this example.

PACS numbers: 47.27.Qb
Keywords: advection–diﬀusion equation, upper bounds, chaotic and turbulent mixing

In this letter we apply some recent developments in the
analysis of the Navier–Stokes equations [1] to mixing and
the advection–diﬀusion equation. Mixing phenomena
are ubiquitous with applications in atmospheric science,
oceanography, chemical engineering, and microﬂuidics,
to name a few. Here we focus on the generic problem of
the advection–diﬀusion equation with a source that re-
plenishes the variance of the passive scalar. The stirring
is eﬀected by a speciﬁed velocity ﬁeld, which may or may
not be turbulent. Our analysis of an idealized model in
this letter lends mathematical precision and rigor to con-
ventional scaling arguments often invoked for these kinds
of problems.

For the passive scalar, complicated behaviour—and ef-
ﬁcient mixing—is often observed even for laminar veloc-
ity ﬁelds. This is the well-known eﬀect of chaotic ad-
vection [2, 3]. Thus we can choose the stirring (the ad-
vecting velocity ﬁeld) to be any divergence-free, possibly
time-dependent ﬂow ﬁeld. The mixing eﬃciency then de-
pends on speciﬁc properties of the stirring ﬁeld as well as
the manner in which the scalar concentration is injected,
which is exactly what would be expected. The bound on
mixing eﬃciency derived in this letter has that feature: it
depends on the stirring ﬁeld and the source distribution.
This is very helpful as it allows for comparison of the rel-
ative eﬀectiveness of various stirring scenarios for, say, a
speciﬁed source. The bounds we obtain are also valid for
turbulent ﬂows, as no assumptions on the smoothness of
the stirring ﬁeld are made.

The advection–diﬀusion equation for the concentra-

tion θ(t, x) of a passive scalar is

vector ﬁeld. Hence without loss of generality we may
take the solution θ(t, x) to be spatially mean zero at all
times.

Variations in the source term in (1) maintain the inho-
mogeneity of the concentration ﬁeld. The stirring (advec-
tion) term may lead to the formation of sharp gradients
of concentration that then enhance the eﬀect of the dif-
fusion term. For deﬁniteness we assume that both the
source and the stirring act on a comparable scale, ℓ
L,
as shown in Figure 1. Because of periodicity, L/ℓ is an
integer. We introduce these two distinct scales in order
to be able to consider the inﬁnite volume limit, L
at ﬁxed ℓ, for the ﬁnal results.

An eﬃcient mixing conﬁguration would have small Θ for
a given S and U , indicating a steady-state with small
variations in the concentration.
In general we expect
that increasing U at ﬁxed S should decrease Θ, for this
represents more vigorous stirring. We will show in this
letter that Θ has a lower bound proportional to Sℓ/U , so
that a source with large ﬂuctuations necessarily produces
a poorly mixed state unless U is increased suﬃciently.

In order to keep track of the eﬀects of the amplitudes
of the source variation and stirring intensity and their
characteristic length scales independently from the inﬂu-
ence of the particular “shapes” of the input and mixing
functions, we decompose s and u into the dimensional
amplitudes (S and U ) and dimensionless shape functions
(Φ and Υ) according to

where τ is an appropriate time scale characterizing the

time-independent, but in any case we presume periodicity
or statistical stationarity with an identiﬁable periods or
relaxation times.

Now consider an arbitrary smooth (dimensionless) spa-

Note that the operator acting on Ψ in (7) is the adjoint of
the advection–diﬀusion operator, which suggests how the

dynamo theory [4]).

Here the P´eclet number is Pe = U ℓ/κ. If the velocity
ﬁeld is time-dependent with timescale τ , the dimension-
less number Sr := ℓ/U τ may be regarded as a Strouhal
number; in any case, we shall refer to it as the Strouhal
number even if the timescale τ is unrelated to u.

At this point we may in principle sharpen (9) by vary-
ing Ψ to provide as tight a bound as possible, as is done
in [5] for the power consumption rate in the Navier–
Stokes equations. But we will not pursue that direction
here, rather we will produce explicit limits via simple
estimates.

are dimensionless constants, independent of Pe and Θ.
The constant c1 depends on dimensional quantities only
through the Strouhal number; it also depends explicitly
on the stirring shape-function Υ. Note also that the func-
tion Ψ depends indirectly on the source shape-function Φ
through its normalization (6), so that both the source
and stirring enter the bound. The constant c2 controls
the diﬀusive part while κ only enters through the P´eclet
number in (11). We still have the freedom to choose Ψ
to optimize c1 for a particular problem, that is, for par-
ticular source and stirring shapes Φ and Υ.

≤

For small Pe, we can focus on the c2 term in (11),
c2Θκ/ℓ2. As we increase the
and obtain the bound S
source amplitude S, holding the other parameters con-
stant, the time-averaged variance Θ2 must eventually in-
crease. An increase in the variance implies that the scalar
is more poorly mixed. There is no avoiding this unless
we increase κ or decrease the scale of the source ℓ: the
eﬃciency of mixing is intrinsically related to the diﬀusiv-
ity.

≤

For large Pe, the more interesting limit for many phys-
ical problems, we focus on the c1 term in (11) to get the
bound S
c1U Θ/ℓ. As we increase the source ampli-
tude S, holding everything else constant, the bound (11)
again implies we must eventually see an increase in the
steady-state variance, Θ2. However, unlike the small Pe
case, we can now (potentially) postpone that increase by
raising U , i.e., by stirring more vigorously. The exact
value of c1 depends on the shape-functions of course, but

is bounded from above—uniformly in the shape of the
stirring—as

The large Pe bound has the nice feature of being indepen-
dent of the diﬀusivity κ, a result expected to hold for the
passive scalar under turbulent or chaotic mixing. How-
ever, the linear scaling with U is not always appropriate,
as will be seen below in the speciﬁc case we studied nu-
merically.

As a physically meaningful nondimensional measure,

we deﬁne the mixing eﬃciency

(14)

The the mixing eﬃciency compares the source amplitude
(S) to the steady-state ﬂuctuations in the concentration
ﬁeld (Θ), and is weighed such that stirring harder (U )
incurs a penalty in the eﬃciency. Large mixing eﬃciency
means that we are getting a well-mixed concentration
(small Θ) compared to the inhomogeneity in the source
(S), at a relatively small cost in U . A high P´eclet number
steady-state mixing device should operate with as high a
mixing eﬃciency as possible.

In the regime of small U , the variance is proportional to
the amplitude of the source, a response we expect when
the stirring does not play an important role. The mix-
ing eﬃciency is thus artiﬁcially high due to the division
by U in (14); this will not concern us as we are primarily
interested in large Pe.

The mixing eﬃciency can also be bounded from below.

This lower bound reﬂects that no matter how we stir—or
if we do not stir—there is still some diﬀusive dissipation
of the scalar variance. The worst mixing eﬃciency is
achieved by injecting variance at scale ℓ while somehow
stirring to keep the scale of the concentration ﬁeld as L.
The lower bound (16) also implies that if there is any

3

variance Θ2 present at the steady state, then it must be
due to some minimum amount of amplitude of the source.
Stirring alone can never generate scalar variance in this
kind of model.

The consequence of the two bounds for S is that
larger Θ must eventually imply large S (from (16), at
ﬁxed κ and L), but large S does not necessarily imply
large Θ, as the diﬀerence can be made up by a large U
in (11). This is what makes enhanced mixing possible.

We may also estimate some small scales in the scalar

For large Pe, the smallest possible size of this dissipation

As an example application, we consider the well-
studied two-dimensional sine ﬂow [6, 7] (or random
wave ﬂow). This ﬂow consists of alternating horizon-
tal and vertical sine shear ﬂows, with phase angles χ1
[0, 2π] randomly chosen at each time period.

In the ﬁrst half of the period, the velocity ﬁeld is

and in the second half-period it is

u(2)(t, x) = √2 U (sin(2πx2/L + χ2) , 0) .

The challenge now lies in choosing Ψ to optimize the
bound as best we can. Because Υ is discontinuous in
time (which is not an obstacle to the bounding proce-
dure), this particular velocity ﬁeld is not very amenable
to optimization via a variational approach, so we shall
be content with taking the simplest case, Ψ = Φ, merely
for illustrative purposes. This choice automatically sat-
isﬁes the normalization (6). Inserting that form into (12)

Figure 2 shows the numerical result of directly sim-
ulating the advection–diﬀusion equation (1) with the
ﬂow (21), along with the bound (22) as a dashed line.
Clearly, while the bound is satisﬁed it is by no means
saturated.
It is not surprising that the linear scaling
with U is not achieved: once the velocity norm U reaches
unity, each alternating sine wave begins to advect the
scalar across the periodic domain more than once with
correspondingly little gain in the mixing eﬃciency. The
oscillations observed in Figure 2 are due to resonances
between the domain size and U . The ﬂow is thus some-
what pathological, but is used here for its numerical ex-
pediency. Future work will compare the bound with nu-
merical results for more complex ﬂows, with Ψ optimized
for a given ﬂow. The dotted line in Fig. 2 is an upper
bound obtained from (13) with Ψ = Φ; it sets an abso-
lute limit on the mixing eﬃciency achievable with any
stirring ﬁeld, for this particular source distribution.

the bulk burning rate V can satisfy an “optimal linear
enhancement bound,” V
K U , where K is a constant
and U is the magnitude of the advecting ﬁeld. The
type of ﬂow required for linear enhancement, called
“percolating ﬂows” in [8], connects distant regions of
unburned material. Perhaps these ﬂows also provide
linear scaling with U for the mixing eﬃciency, but we
have not yet investigated this.

Unlike the solution of the full problem, which requires
a nonzero diﬀusivity to keep Θ uniformly bounded in
time, the bounding procedure does not require any dif-
fusivity. That is, for large Pe we may omit c2 from the
bound altogether and focus on c1, to try and minimize it
with respect to Ψ. Also, we do not have to solve the min-
imization problem for c1 as a function of Ψ as an initial
value problem: we may simply insert a form for Ψ that
tracks the time dependence of the velocity ﬁeld (which
could be periodic, for instance, even though the scalar
concentration need not be).

Although we speciﬁed a body source in our problem,
a source of concentration at the boundaries can be mim-
icked by a sharp source concentrated near the walls [9].
However, the type of wall boundary condition that can
be modeled in this manner is restricted to ﬁxed scalar
ﬂux.

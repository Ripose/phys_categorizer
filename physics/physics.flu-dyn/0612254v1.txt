We report the observation of intermittency in gravity-capillary wave turbulence on the surface of
mercury. We measure the temporal ﬂuctuations of surface wave amplitude at a given location. We
show that the shape of the probability density function of the local slope increments of the surface
waves strongly changes across the time scales. The related structure functions and the ﬂatness are
found to be power laws of the time scale on more than one decade. The exponents of these power
laws increase nonlinearly with the order of the structure function. All these observations show the
intermittent nature of the increments of the local slope in wave turbulence. We discuss the possible
origin of this intermittency.

One of the most striking feature of turbulence is the
occurrence of bursts of intense motion within more quies-
cent ﬂuid ﬂow. This generates an intermittent behavior
[1, 2]. One of the quantitative characterization of in-
termittency is given by the probability density function
(PDF) of the velocity increments between two points sep-
arated by a distance r. Starting from a roughly Gaus-
sian PDF at integral scale, the PDFs undergo a contin-
uous deformation when r is decreased within the inertial
range and develop more and more stretched exponen-
tial tails [3]. Deviation from the Gaussian shape can be
quantiﬁed by the ﬂatness of the PDF. The origin of non-
Gaussian statistics in three dimensional hydrodynamic
turbulence has been ascribed to the formation of strong
vortices since the early work of Batchelor and Townsend
[1]. However, the physical mechanism of intermittency is
still an open question that motivates a lot of studies in
three dimensional turbulence [4]. Intermittency has been
also observed in a lot of problems involving transport by
a turbulent ﬂow for which the analytical description of
the anomalous scaling laws can be obtained [5].

It has been known since the work of Zakharov and col-
laborators that weakly interacting nonlinear waves can
also display Kolmogorov type spectra related to an en-
ergy ﬂux cascading from large to small scales [6, 7]. These
spectra have been analytically computed using perturba-
tion techniques, but can also be obtained by dimensional
analysis using Kolmogorov-type arguments [8]. More re-
cently, it has been proposed that intermittency correc-
tions should be also taken into account in wave turbu-
lence [9] and may be connected to singularities or co-
herent structures [8, 10] such as wave breaking [11] or
whitecaps [8] in the case of surface waves. However, in-
termittency in wave turbulence is often related to non
Gaussian statistics of low wave number Fourier ampli-
tudes [10], thus it is not obviously related to small scale
intermittency of hydrodynamic turbulence. Surprisingly,

there exist only a small number of experimental studies
on wave turbulence [12–16] compared to hydrodynamic
turbulence, and to the best of our knowledge, no exper-
imental observation of intermittency has been reported
in wave turbulence.

In this letter, we report the observation of an intermit-
tent behavior for gravity-capillary waves on the surface
of a layer of mercury. We show that we need to compute
the second-order diﬀerences of the surface wave ampli-
tude in order to display intermittency. We observe that
the shape of their probability density function changes
strongly across the time scales (from a Gaussian at large
scales to a stretched exponential shape at short scales).
This short-scale intermittency is conﬁrmed by comput-
ing the structure functions for various time scales. The
structure functions of order p (from 1 to 6) and the ﬂat-
ness are found to be power laws of the time scale on more
than one decade. The exponents of the power laws of the
structure functions are found to depend nonlinearly on
p. All these observations show the intermittent nature of
the local slope increments of the turbulent surface waves.

The experimental setup has been already described
elsewhere [17]. It consists of a square vessel, 20 × 20 cm2,
ﬁlled with mercury up to a height of 18 mm. Mercury is
chosen because of its low kinematic viscosity (one order
of magnitude smaller than that of water), thus reducing
wave dissipation. Note however that similar qualitative
results to the ones reported here are found when chang-
ing mercury by water. Surface waves are generated by
the horizontal motion of one rectangular (13 × 3.5 cm2)
plunging PMMA wave maker driven by an electromag-
netic vibration exciter. The wave maker is driven with
random noise excitation, supplied by a function genera-
tor, and selected in a frequency range 0 - 6 Hz by a low-
pass ﬁlter. The rms value of the velocity ﬂuctuations
of the wave maker is proportional to the driving voltage
Urms applied to the vibration exciter. Surface waves are

generated 3 cm inward from one vessel wall. The local
vertical displacement of the ﬂuid is measured, 7 cm away
from the wave maker, by a capacitive sensor. The sensor
allows wave height measurements from 10 µm up to 2 cm
with a 20 mm/V sensitivity and a 0.1 ms response time.
A typical recording of the surface wave amplitude, η(t),
at a given location is displayed in the inset of Fig. 1 as
a function of time. The surface strongly ﬂuctuates with
a large distribution of amplitudes (see afterwards). The
mean value of the amplitude is close to zero. In order to
characterize the statistical properties of such a signal (in-
set of Fig. 1), η(t) is recorded by means of an acquisition
card with a 1 kHz sampling rate during 3000 s, leading
to 3 × 106 points recorded. The power spectrum and the
probability density function (PDF) are then computed.
At high enough forcing, the signature of a wave turbu-
lence regime is observed [17]: a scale invariant spectrum
with two power-law frequency dependences (see Fig. 1)
and an asymmetric PDF (see Fig. 2). The low frequency
spectrum part ∼ f −4.3 corresponds to the gravity regime,
whereas the high frequency one ∼ f −2.8 corresponds to
the capillary regime. For the present characteristics of
the forcing, both power-law exponents are in fair agree-
ment with weak turbulence theory predicting a power
spectrum of the wave amplitudes ∼ f −4 for gravity waves
[6], and ∼ f −17/6 for capillary waves [7]. However, the
f −4 scaling has been also ascribed to cusps [18]. In ad-
dition, as emphasized in [17], only the capillary regime
is robust, the exponent for the gravity regime being
strongly dependent of the characteristics of the forcing.
The cross-over near 30 Hz corresponds to the transition
between gravity and capillary wave turbulence spectra.
At still higher frequencies (greater than 150 Hz), viscous
dissipation dominates and ends the cascade of energy in-
jected from large scale forcing.

The statistical distribution of wave height, η, at a given
location is displayed in Fig. 2. At high enough forcing,
the PDF is no longer Gaussian, and becomes asymmetric.
The positive rare events such as high crest waves are
more probable than deep trough waves. This also can be
directly observed on the temporal signal η(t) in Fig. 1.

To test the intermittent properties of a stochastic sta-
tionary signal η(t), one generally computes the incre-
ments δη(τ ) ≡ η(t + τ ) − η(t). The structure functions
of the signal sp(τ ) ≡ h|δη(τ )|pi = h|η(t + τ ) − η(t)|pi are
also computed to seek a possible scaling behavior with
the time lag τ [3], h·i denoting a temporal average. How-
ever, if a signal has a steep power spectrum E(f ) ∼ f −n
with n > 3 (e.g. in Fig. 1), the signal is then at least one
time diﬀerentiable, and therefore the increments have a
trivial meaning, and s2(τ ) ≡ h[η(t + τ ) − η(t)]2i ∼ τ 2
whatever n [19, 20]. To test intermittency properties of a
diﬀerentiable signal, a more pertinent statistical estima-
tor is related to the second-order diﬀerences of the signal,
∆η(τ ) ≡ η(t + 2τ ) − 2η(t) + η(t − τ ) [21]. The struc-
ture functions are then deﬁned as Sp(τ ) ≡ h|∆η(τ )|pi.

to their respective standard deviation στ , are plotted in

tion time of η(t) being τc ≃ 63 ms. A shape deformation
of the PDFs of ∆η(τ )/στ is observed with the time lag
τ . The PDF is nearly Gaussian at large τ . When τ is de-
creased from this integral scale, the PDF’s shape changes
continuously, and strongly diﬀers from a Gaussian (see

the PDF’s tails in Fig. 3). This is a direct signature of
intermittency. The extreme ﬂuctuating events (large val-
ues of ∆η(τ )/στ ) are all the more likely when the time
scale τ is short. Thus, the signal of the surface-wave
amplitude displays intermittent bursts during which the
slope varies in an abrupt way within a short time. The
second-order diﬀerences of the wave-amplitude signal are
indeed related to intermittency of the local slope incre-
ments of the surface waves.

They correspond to discontinuities in the vertical veloc-
ity v of the surface, thus leading to f −2 spectrum, i.e.,
h[v(t + τ ) − v(t)]2i ∝ τ . This leads to the dimensional
estimate h|η(t+2τ )−2η(t)+η(t−τ )|pi ∝ τ p+p/2 = τ 3p/2,
in fair agreement with the measurements for p = 1 and
2 (see Fig. 5). The nonlinearity of ξp (c2 6= 0) is an-
other direct signature of intermittency [3]. This inter-
mittency is observed for 20 ≤ 1/τ ≤ 200 Hz, that is, for
the capillary wave regime. The so-called intermittency
coeﬃcient c2 can be also deduced from the measurement
of the ﬂatness as a function of τ (inset of Fig. 4). In-
deed, inserting the expression of ξp into F = S4/S2
2 with
Sp(τ ) ∼ τ ξp , leads to F ∼ τ −4c2 . Thus, our measure-
ments give c2 = −c/4 = 0.22 ± 0.008 which is in agree-
ment with the value of c2 deduced from the exponents of
the structure functions.

tom). Gaussian ﬁt with zero mean and unit standard devi-
ation (−−). Correlation time τc ≃ 63 ms. Each curve has
been shifted for clarity. Same forcing parameters as in Fig. 1.

Figure 4 shows the structure functions Sp(τ ) of the
second-order diﬀerences of the wave amplitude as a func-
tion of the time lag τ . For 5 ≤ τ ≤ 50 ms, all the
structure functions of order p = 1 to 6 are found to be
power laws of τ , Sp(τ ) ∼ τ ξp , where ξp is an increasing
function of the order p. Note that when τ & τc, Sp(τ ) is
found to saturate (e.g. towards 2hη2i, for p=2) as usual
[3]. To quantify the intermittency of the signal (i.e. the
PDF shape deformation across the temporal scales), the
dependence of the ﬂatness, S4/S2
2 , as a function of τ is
displayed in the inset of the Fig. 4. At large τ , the ﬂat-
ness is close to 3 (the value for a Gaussian) and increases
up to 26 at the shortest τ , corresponding to a much ﬂat-
ter PDF (see Fig. 3). The ﬂatness is a power law of the
time scale: S4/S2

2 ∼ τ c with c = −0.88 ± 0.03.

The evolution of the exponents ξp of the structure
functions as a function of p is shown in Fig. 5 from the
slopes of the log-log curves in Fig. 4. ξp is found to be
a nonlinear function of p such that ξp = c1p − c2
2 p2 with
c1 = 1.65 ± 0.05 and c2 = 0.2 ± 0.02. The value of c1 is
related to the exponent of the low frequency spectrum,
−2c1 − 1 ≈ −4.3 ± 0.1. As said above, this value of c1
can be related to the cusps observed on the ﬂuid surface.

functions computed from the ﬁrst-order diﬀerences of the
˜ξp , (open circles in Fig.
signal, h|η(t + τ ) − η(t)|pi ∼ τ
5). One can thus compare with theoretical predictions
of weak turbulence [24] (full circles in Fig. 5). Dimen-
sional analysis for weak capillary wave turbulence gives
˜ξp = 11p/12 (solid line). Although the experimentally
measured slope is slightly smaller than 11/12 ≃ 0.92, it
is too close to 1 in order to display intermittency just by
computing the structure functions from the signal incre-
ments. Indeed, as said above, since our signal is diﬀeren-
tiable, the signal increments are poorly informative, and
the exponents ˜ξp of the structure functions of the signal
˜ξp , are expected to be
increments, h|η(t + τ ) − η(t)|pi ∼ τ
such that ˜ξp ∼ p [19, 20]. This shows that second-order

We have reported that short-scale intermittency oc-
curs on the second-order diﬀerences of surface wave am-
plitude. As previously proposed, intermittency could be
related to coherent structures on the ﬂuid surface [10],
such as wave breaking [11] or whitecaps [8]. Here, wave
breaking or whitecaps do not occur, but cusps are ob-
served on the ﬂuid surface. However, we do not presently
have a theory that determines ξp for large p. We think
that the observation of small scale intermittency in our
system that strongly diﬀers from high Reynolds number
hydrodynamic turbulence is of primary interest. It can
indeed motivate explanations of intermittency diﬀerent
than the ones considering the dynamics of the Navier-
Stokes equation or the existence of coherent structures.
A more general explanation can be related to the proper-
ties of the ﬂuctuations of the energy ﬂux that are shared
by diﬀerent systems displaying an energy cascade.

Dynamics of propagating turbulent pipe ﬂow structures. Part II: Relaminarization

(Dated: January 20, 2014)

Propagating structures, based upon a Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition, undergoing reverse transition
from turbulent to laminar ﬂow are investigated. The turbulent ﬂow is generated by a direct numerical
simulation starting at a fully turbulent Reynolds number of Reτ = 150, and is slowly decreased until
Reτ = 95. At this low Reynolds number the high frequency modes decay ﬁrst, leaving only the
slower decaying streamwise vortices. The ﬂow undergoes a chugging phenomena, where it begins
to relaminarize and increase its mean velocity. The remaining propagating modes then destabilize
the streamwise vortices, rebuild the energy spectra, and eventually the ﬂow regains its turbulent
state. Our results capture three chugging cycles before the ﬂow completely relaminarizes. The high
frequency modes present in the outer layer decay ﬁrst, establishing the importance of the outer
region in the self-sustaining mechanism of wall bound turbulence.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In part I the eﬀect of drag reduction by spanwise wall
oscillation was studied.1 The second instance where drag
reduction is seen is in a relaminarizing ﬂow. As the tur-
bulence dies, so does the Reynolds stress generation, and
thus, for a constant pressure gradient driven ﬂow, the
ﬂow rate increases. As we will show, the ﬂow does not im-
mediately relaminarize, but instead goes through a series
of chugging motions. In these chugging motions, the ﬂow
loses its turbulent inertial range, losing the high frequen-
cies ﬁrst. Before the ﬂow has completely relaminarized,
certain key propagating waves interact with the decay-
ing streamwise vortices, recreating the cascading energy
scales that populate the inertial subrange. In this part,
we examine the dynamics found in relaminarization to
understand how a ﬂow remains turbulent to better eluci-
date the mechanism behind the self-sustaining nature of
turbulence.

Previous work has

focused either on relaminar-
ization from favorable pressure gradients,2,3,4 strong
accelerations5, or examining relaminarization as a
testbed to understand the decay rate of structures.6 Out-
side the ﬁeld of wall turbulence, there has been related
work in studying relaminarization and bifurcations in
spherical Couette ﬂow.7 The only work found that relates
to drag reduction was the examination of linear feedback
control in a turbulent channel ﬂow that achieved total
relaminarization.8 Nevertheless, it is of interest to exam-
ine the ﬁeld of transition where recent work has added
to our knowledge of pipe ﬂow structures and their inter-
actions.

Both Kerswell9 and Faisst and Eckhardt10 have found
traveling wave solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations
through continuation methods. They identiﬁed struc-
tures for rotationally symmetric solutions, which is con-
ﬁrmed here in this paper for Reτ = 95 and in previous
work11 for Reτ = 150 through a Karhunen-Lo`eve de-
composition of a direct numerical simulation of turbu-
lent pipe ﬂow. Moreover, Kerswell found that the three-
fold rotation, or azimuthal wavenumber n = 3 in our
notation, is the largest contributor near the critical bi-

furcation point associated with the laminar to turbulent
transition. This also corresponds to our ﬁndings, as we
will show that when observing the chugging phenomena,
the n = 3 traveling wave is often the most energetic at
the point which the ﬂow reasserts itself as turbulent.

Also of note, of which we apply their results to fur-
ther the understanding of this chugging phenomena, is
the minimal channel work by Webber, Handler, and
Sirovich12. They indicate that the nonlinear terms in the
Navier-Stokes equations lead to triad interactions of the
KL modes which is responsible for the transfer of energy
between modes. This occurs whenever wavenumbers of
three modes (m, n, q), (m′, n′, q′), and (m′′, n′′, q′′) sum
to zero, shown in equations 1 and 2 below,

II. NUMERICAL METHOD

Details on the numerical method for generating the
DNS ﬂow ﬁelds and on the Karhunen-Lo`eve method can
be found in part I of this paper.1

Over a time of 12,000 t+ the Reynolds number was
slowly reduced from Reτ = 150 to a value of Reτ =
95, and let run for 5000t+ to eliminate any transitional
eﬀects, as seen in Figure 1. Data was then collected for
10, 000t+, which included three distinct chugs before the
ﬂow completely relaminarized, as seen in Figure 2.

The grid resolution was kept the same as for the orig-
inal Reτ = 150 case, thus eﬀectively reﬁning the grid
further to ∆r+ ≈ 0.49 and ∆θ+ ≈ 3.1 near the wall and
∆x+ = ∆y+ ≈ 2.0 near the centerline with a constant
streamwise resolution of ∆z+ = 4.0.

FIG. 4: Root-mean-squared velocity proﬁles for Reτ = 95
(solid) and Reτ = 150 (dashed) versus wall units y+. The
inﬂections near y+ = 90 are eﬀects of the laminar chugging,
as the rms is averaged over all time steps.

The proﬁle of the mean ﬂow with respect to wall units
is seen in Figure 3. At this low of a Reynolds number,
the ﬂow does not conform to the log layer, yet near the
wall it still obeys the sublayer. Also, the ﬂow does not
conform to the laminar parabolic proﬁle, indicating that
it is indeed turbulent.

The root-mean-square (rms) velocity proﬁles also show
a turbulent trend as seen in Figure 4, although in com-
parison to the Reτ = 150, the radial and azimuthal ﬂuc-
tuations are about half as strong, and the streamwise rms
is shifted further away in wall units from the wall. Also

noteworthy is the strong ﬂuctuations near the center of
the pipe y+ ≈ 90. This is the ﬁrst indication that the
dynamics near the center of the pipe diﬀer from what is
expected for the fully turbulent case.

The Reynolds stress proﬁle also diﬀers from the Reτ =
150 case and is shown in Figure 5. The Reynolds stress
for the Reτ = 95 case has roughly half the magnitude
throughout the radial proﬁle, although the peak Reynold
stress is also found at the same location of y+ = 31. The
largest deviation from the expected proﬁle occurs near
the centerline after y+ ≈ 60, where the Reynolds stress

begins to ﬂuctuate. In particular, between y+ = 88 and
92, the Reynolds strees is negative, which is physically
interpreted as turbulence damping. Now, in addition
to the rms deviation near the centerline, this Reynolds
stress ﬂuctuation indicates that the relaminarization pro-
cess begins at the center of the pipe and goes outward.

Turning from statistics to the KL decomposition, we
ﬁnd that the chaotic attractor is reduced in size, as ex-
pected with a reduction in Reτ , from DKL = 2453 to
DKL = 66, shown in Figure 6. This dimension is simi-
lar to that found in Part I where the oscillated pipe was
barely turbulent with a dimension of DKL = 102, and
any stronger oscillation would have resulted in relami-
narization.

In observing the energy content of the modes in Ta-
ble I, and the most increased and decreased in Table II,

we ﬁnd that the shear modes increase drastically, which
is a result of the chugging motion and large mean ﬂow
rate ﬂuctuations. Also of note is the increase in strength
of the n = 3, 4 and 5 streamwise vortices (m = 0) and
their associated wall traveling waves (m = 1). The in-
crease in the (0, 1, 1) and (1, 0, 1) traveling waves, since
they are not found in the work by Kerswell9 and Faisst
and Eckhardt10, could be the catalysts of energy triads
in equations 1 and 2 between the n = 3, 4 and 5 rolls
and wall traveling waves. For example, the (1, 3, 1) and
(1, 4, 1) waves interact through the (0, 1, 1) catalyst, and
the (1, 3, 1) wave and the (0, 3, 1) roll interact through the
(1, 0, 1) catalyst. The modes that decreased the most in
energy are more of a result of the lower Reynolds num-
ber, as the high modes n = 8, 9 and 10 in the Reτ = 150
case were an important basis for streamwise vortices that
were 94 − 117 wall units apart. However, at Reτ = 95,
these represent spacings of 60 − 75 wall units, which is
too small, thus explaining their drop in energy.

Looking at the normal speed locus, the same trend as
that of Reτ = 150 is found for Reτ = 95, but with a
slightly faster advection speed of 8.64 versus 8.41. This

speed, as expected, as the advection speed was shown
to scale with the mean ﬂow rate when the ﬂow rate was
increased in part I for spanwise wall oscillation.

In visualizing the most energetic modes, the same
structures as those found in the Reτ = 150 case are
present. Figures 8 - 13 show the coherent vorticity for
the most energetic modes for each subclasses. Since the
(0, 0, 1) mode has no coherent vorticity, the velocity is
shown. The coherent vorticity is deﬁned as the eigen-
value of the rotational component of the velocity gradi-
ent tensor.13 Although slight diﬀerences are visible due
to the lower Reynolds number, the same trends and char-
acteristics are found for the KL modes as those found in
the Reτ = 150 case.

IV. DYNAMICS

Recreating the time history of the KL modes reveals
the interaction between the shear modes, roll modes, and
propagating waves. As shown in Figure 14, the chugging
phenomena happens when the propagating modes drop in
energy. This happens at time t+ ≈ 1600, t+ ≈ 3500, and
t+ ≈ 5500, and starts the chugging phenomena. At t+ ≈
8000, the propagating modes drop too far in energy, and
the ﬂow relaminarizes. The chugging cycle ends again
when the propagating waves spike at t+ ≈ 2200, t+ ≈
4100, and t+ ≈ 6200.

Examining the propagating waves based upon their
subclass, shown in Figure 15, we ﬁnd that the asymmet-

FIG. 16: Ratio of lift mode energy to wall mode energy as a
function of time. As the lift mode energy decreases with re-
spect to the wall mode energy, relaminarization begins. This
establishes the importance of the high frequency modes in
the outer layer, represented by the lift modes, in the self-
sustaining mechanism of wall turbulence.

ric and ring modes stay about the same energy as each
other, and the wall modes are about a factor of 4 times
more energetic. The lift modes, on the other hand, vary
greatly in energy. When the lift modes decay from high
to low energy, this coincides with the start of a chugging
cycle, and ends when the lift modes regain the high en-
ergy state. This is emphasized in Figure 16 where the
ratio of the lift mode total energy to the wall mode total
energy is plotted.

Observing the energy spectra of the chug, we ﬁrst
revisit the total energy distribution of the propagating
waves as averaged over the entire ﬂow, seen in Figure 17.
Again, like the Reτ = 150 spectrum, the lift modes are
more energetic than the wall modes in the tail end for
high wavenumbers. Thus, when the tail end of the spec-
tra dies oﬀ by two orders of magnitude at the start of the

FIG. 19: Energy ﬂow chart for turbulence subclasses with
catalysts. If any of these legs are disrupted, turbulence reduc-
tion (or drag reduction) begins. For instance, in the previous
part1 the energy in the wall modes were reduced by lifting
them oﬀ the wall by spanwise wall oscillations to a higher
speed mean ﬂow, reducing their energy by forcing them to
advect faster and died faster. In the current relaminarization
case, not enough is present to fully populate the lift modes,
and so their energy decreases and again the energy balance is
disrupted.

process cannot be halted in time by the transferring of
energy from the wall modes to the lift modes, typically
through the (1,3,1) or (1,4,1) modes, the ﬂow will com-
pletely relaminarize. Adding in the ﬁndings of triad in-
teractions by Webber et al.,12 the ﬂow of energy is shown
in Figure 19. The shear to roll interaction are catalyzed
by the rolls themselves, the roll to wall interactions are
catalyzed mostly by the ring modes, and the wall to lift
modes are catalyzed by the ring, asymmetric modes, and
other lift modes. In the relaminarization process, it is this
ﬁnal leg that fails, breaking the mechanism, and starting
relaminarization from the center of the pipe.

V. CONCLUSIONS

It is apparent through the examination of the span-
wise wall oscillated case in Part I and the relaminariza-
tion case in Part II that if any leg of the energy cycle
in a turbulent ﬂow is disrupted, the resulting imbalance
can lead to the start of a relaminarization process, and
even complete relaminarization. In Part I, the propagat-
ing wall modes were pushed to higher advection speeds,
reducing their eﬀective lifespan, not giving them enough
time to take energy from the roll modes, breaking the
third leg of the mechanism. Here in Part II, with lower
pressure gradient, there is not enough energy to properly
maintain the lift modes, and the last leg of the process is
broken, starting the relaminarization process.

Thus, in conclusion, we ﬁnd that while the wall modes
and near wall interactions are responsible for the genera-
tion of turbulence from the pressure gradient, the turbu-
lence in the outer region is necessary to maintain the
proper inertial range in the energy spectra, and that
without it, the relaminarization process begins.

namics of the lift to wall energy ratio, the chugging spectra

wall turbulence on the high frequencies found in the inertial
range, represented by the lift modes.

of the lift modes in maintaining the turbulent ﬂow.

As noted in the Reτ = 150 case, the lift modes are
responsible for the majority of turbulence near the cen-
ter of the pipe, as the wall modes stay near the wall,
even for high quantum number. Thus, the importance
of the outer region in the self sustaining mechanism of
turbulence is reinforced. If the lift modes do not receive
enough energy, cascaded through the wall modes, the re-
laminarization process begins near the center of the pipe,
conﬁrmed by the rms and Reynolds stress proﬁles. If the

Abstract

The behavior of a two dimensional, steady turbulent mixing layer was investigated. Be-
sides the usual velocity components, all the contributing components of the Reynolds
Stresses are also calculated and presented. The results indicated that in the two dimen-
sional steady turbulent mixing layers the theory of self-preservation is not valid for all the
ﬂow domain, and that the ﬂow is turbulent regime is divided into two areas. Through
calculation of Reynolds Stress components at the point of initiation of the ﬂow, it was
shown that the turbulent ﬂow in the area containing the point of singularity of the ﬂow
is not, as previously believed, self-preserved.

1 Introduction

Turbulence is the most frequently occurring mode of ﬂuid motion. It is characterized by
high ﬂuid particle mixing, and high energy dissipation [1-3]. The exact time-dependent
nature of events leading to the onset and development of turbulence is not fully known;
however, by the aid of time averaging techniques we can obtain meaningful and practically
useful statistical deﬁnitions [3]. Nearly all the problems that are studied in the ﬁeld of
Turbulent Fluid Dynamics are numerically extensive and expensive [3-5], and there is

no single concept to model diﬀerent classes of turbulent ﬂow regimes [3-5]. In general a
turbulent ﬂow is characterized by random variation of ﬂow variables, high levels of ﬂuid
particle mixing, and high energy dissipation [2, 3].

Turbulent ﬂow regimes may be divided into two main categories: Free Turbulence,
where no physical boundary limits the development of ﬂow: Bounded Turbulence, where
ﬂow is restricted by physical boundaries [2]. Experimentally, Free turbulent ﬂows are
easy to generate, and that is primarily why they have been so extensively studied. From
a theoretical stand point, their formulation and simulation is also much simpler, since
for normal incompressible ﬂows, no pressure gradient term has relevance [3]. In studying
free turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds it is desirable for practical reasons to conﬁne oneself, at ﬁrst,
to rather simple but important elementary ﬂow patterns [1, 2]. These elementary ﬂow
patterns may be classiﬁed into two main groups: (1) free jets, and (2) wake ﬂows behind
obstacles. The ﬂow pattern under investigation here is a plane, two dimensional mixing
layer [3]. In this ﬂow pattern it is possible to distinguish one main ﬂow direction with
velocity substantially greater than in any other direction [1, 2].

Through out the past few decades, turbulent plane mixing layer has been the subject
of numerous experimental and theoretical research, and it is widely used to investigate
various aspects of phenomena related to free turbulence, including process and nature of
mixing [3], structure of turbulent components and their self-preservation [3-6], stability
of the ﬂow [4], transfer of momentum and energy [5], intensity, and rates of temporal and
spatial expansions of free turbulent ﬂows [6].

The spatial and temporal development of the turbulence is closely correlated to the
development of Reynolds Stress Components. The existing literature indicates that for
free turbulent ﬂows, the entire ﬂow domain was considered to be self-preserved [7]. How-
ever, in this investigation it is shown that the self-preservation theory is not applicable to
all the ﬂow ﬁeld, and that at areas very close to the point of initiation of turbulent ﬂow
regime the said theory is not applicable, i.e. the ﬂow is not self-preserved.

Following the introduction the ﬂuid dynamics equations are indicated and the formu-
lation is completed. In section three, the simulation results and discussions are presented.
And in the ﬁnal section discussion and concluding remarks are presented.

2 Turbulent plane mixing layer’s governing equations

For a 2-dimensional incompressible turbulent plane mixing layer, the governing equations
are Reynolds equations and the continuity equation. They may be written in the following
form:

+ ¯u1

+ ¯u2

where bar represents time-averaged quantities, and u1, u2 are the velocity components in
1, and u′
the x and y directions respectively; also u′
2 are the ﬂuctuating components of the
u1 and u2 velocity components respectively.

To close the above set of equations the Reynolds Stress Equation Model (”RSM”)
is used [4]. The exact equation for the transport of Reynolds Stresses, Rij, takes the
following form:

+ div(RijV ) = Pij + Dij − εij + Πij + Ωij ,

(4)

∂Rij
∂t

where Pij, Dij, εij, Πij, and Ωij represent rate of production of Rij, transport of Rij
by diﬀusion, rate of dissipation of Rij, transport of Rij due to turbulent pressure-strain
interactions, and transport of Rij due to rotation respectively. These terms are represented
by the following equations:

Pij = −(Rim

+ Rjm

∂ ¯Vj

∂ ¯Vi

) ,

where V bar indicates the velocity vector, and having

also,

in which Cµ = 0.09, and σk = 1.00.

Assuming isotropy of the small dissipative eddies, and assuming that it aﬀects the

normal Reynolds stresses (i = j) only, and in equal measures we have [4]:

Dij =

νt = (k2/ε)Cµ ,

εij = (2/3)εδij ,

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

where the Kronecker delta, δij is given by δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i 6= j.

The transport of Reynolds stresses due to pressure-strain interactions is calculated by

the following expression:

Πij = −C1(

)(Rij − (2/3)kδij) − C2(Pij − (2/3)P δij) ,

(9)

ε
k

in which C1 = 1.80 and C2 = 0.60. The rotational term is given by:

Ωij = −2ωk(Rjmeikm + Rimejkm) .

(10)

Here ωk is the rotation vector and eijk is the alternating symbol; eijk = 1 if i, j and k are
diﬀerent and in cyclic order, eijk = −1 if i, j and k are diﬀerent and in anti-cyclic order
and eijk = 0 if any two indices are the same.

Turbulent kinetic energy k is needed in the above formula and can be found by adding

the three normal stresses together:

k = 0.5(R11 + R22 + R33)

(11)

and the equation for the transport of scalar dissipation rate ε is:

∂t

µt
σε

+ div(ρεV ) = div(

gradε) + 2(ε/k)C1εµtEij · Eij − ρ(ε2/k)C2ε ,

(12)

where C1ε = 1.44 and C2ε = 1.92, and Eij is the mean rate of deformation of a ﬂuid
element and Eij · Eij is their scalar product [4]. Note that for the free stream velocities
Rij = 0 and ε = 0.

Therefore we have obtained six equations which must be solved simultaneously to
provide the two unknown velocity components, three Reynolds stress components and
the scalar turbulent dissipation rate.

With the aid of standard Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) schemes and formu-
lations, namely the Central Finite Diﬀerence Discretization, and using a forward time-
marching scheme, the equations are numerically simulated and solved. The time marching
is carried out until the steady state conditions were established. The x, y and t steps are
determined by trial and error and are ﬁxed and equal to 0.0001/40 m, 0.00001/40 m, and
10−7 seconds respectively.

3 Simulation results and discussions

The respective computer codes for the CFD formulation of the turbulent plane mixing
layer are run until the steady state solution is obtained. Using the approximation, for
free stream velocities of Umax = 10.0(m/s), Umin = 5.0(m/s), the velocity component
distributions and the non-dimensional Reynolds stress components at various ﬂow sec-
tions are obtained, and for sections located at about x = 0.00001(m), near the initiation
point of the ﬂow, where inherently a critical point of discontinuity exists, and about
x = 0.000036(m), far down-stream from the point of initiation of the ﬂow, are plotted
and presented in the following ﬁgures. In the following ﬁgures Uref = Umax − Umin.

Figure 1 indicates the experimental results for the spatial expansion of the turbulent
mixing layer obtained by D. Oster and I. Wygnanski [7]. In the same ﬁgure, the simulation
results obtained from the utilized CFD code are indicated.

In Figure 2, the Reynolds Stress distribution obtained experimentally [7], at x =
300mm, x = 500 mm through 1700 mm, and by the utilized CFD formulation, at the
area close to the point of initiation of the turbulent ﬂow, is shown.

Figures 3 and 4 indicate the variation of u velocity component against the non- dimen-
sional vertical distance at two intersections close to the point of initiation of the mixing
layer, as calculated by the utilized CFD scheme.

Figures 5 and 6 show the distribution of non-dimensional u′2 Reynolds Stress Compo-
nents at cross sections close to the point of initiation of turbulent ﬂow, calculated by the
used CFD scheme.

From these ﬁgures, the reduction in the peak value of turbulent intensity in the ﬂow
direction indicates that the in the region under consideration the ﬂow is not self- preserv-
ing.

Figures 7 and 8 present the variation of the non-dimensional v′2 Reynolds Stress Com-
ponents at cross sections close to the point of initiation of turbulent ﬂow, determined by
the used CFD code.

Figures 7 and 8 also indicate that the turbulent ﬂow at the desired area is not self-
preserving. In addition, comparing the order of magnitudes of u′2 and v′2 Reynolds Stress
components in ﬁgures 8 through 10, although the relative contribution of u′2 component
to the generation of turbulence is more, its eﬀect on further development of turbulence
regime downstream of the point of initiation of the plane mixing layer is reduced.

Figures 9 and 10 show the distribution of the time averaged, non-dimensional auto-
correlated components of the turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations, very close to the point of
emergence of the mixing layer, obtained by the CFD solution.

From ﬁgures 9 and 10, comparing the maximum value of the turbulence intensity with
the experimental values measured by Oster and Wygnanski [7], Yule, and Spencer, both
presented at the same reference and indicated in Table 1, the acceptable performance of
the CFD solution and our results is established.

In addition, Figures 5 through 10 indicate that turbulence Reynolds Stresses, which
are themselves responsible for turbulence generation, have their peak value at the center

of symmetry of the ﬂow. This fact together with the order of magnitude of Reynolds
Stress variation complies with the known behavior of such turbulent ﬂow regimes [3-7].

Based upon their experimental set up, erected to study free and forced turbulent plane
mixing layers, D. Oster and I. Wygnanski had deducted that for free stream velocity ratios
of less than 0.6 the ﬂow remains self-preserving [7]. However, their area of interest started
200 mm down stream of the point of initiation of the turbulent ﬂow.

The results obtained by the utilized formulation indicated that for the area of interest
in such ﬂow patterns the auto-correlated Reynolds Stress components have closer spatial
behavior, but the cross-correlation of turbulent velocity components has a diﬀerent con-
tribution to the generation of turbulence, as it shows a larger peak at 0.00001 m, and
decays faster at 0.000036 m from the point of initiation of turbulent ﬂow regime.

Referring to the our results, D. Oster and I. Wygnanski’s deduction is invalid for the

area of the ﬂow close to the point of initiation of turbulence regime.
ures 5 through 10 indicate that at points further away from, but close to, the point of
initiation of turbulence ﬂow, the auto-correlated components of Reynolds Stresses play
the dominant role in generating and maintaining the turbulence behavior. As a further
expansion to such deduction it can be noted that at initial stages of such ﬂow regimes,
turbulence starts and expands more due to contribution of cross-correlated component
of velocity ﬂuctuations, and as the inﬂuenced region of turbulent ﬂow increases, most of
the generated momentum and energy of turbulent components needed to generate and
maintain the turbulent ﬂow pattern is supported through the inﬂuence of the auto- corre-
lated ﬂuctuating velocity components. In other words, there are two regions of Reynolds

the turbulence is generated through a higher correlation of vertical ﬂuctuating velocity
components; such close correlation decays yielding a second mechanism of turbulence gen-
eration, forming a region at which turbulence is mainly maintained by higher temporal
auto-correlation of ﬂuctuating velocity components.

4 Conclusion

The particular area under consideration includes a point of discontinuity, critical point,
where all the ﬂow variables are constantly zero [3-7]. As the starting point of the turbulent
ﬂow regime, the consequent development of the turbulent mixing layer is dependent to
events that take place in this very small region. Comparing the results with similar
experimental research on free turbulent plane mixing layers, we deduct that the obtained
results are acceptable [5, 7]. However, the complex nature of events in this region and
their ultimate eﬀect on the development of turbulent ﬂow deserve much more theoretical
and experimental investigation.

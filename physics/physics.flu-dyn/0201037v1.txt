Scaling dependence on the ﬂuid viscosity ratio in
the selective withdrawal transition

Itai Cohen

January 2002

Abstract

In the selective withdrawal experiment ﬂuid is withdrawn through a
tube with its tip suspended a distance S above a two-ﬂuid interface. At
suﬃciently low withdrawal rates, Q, the interface forms a steady state
hump and only the upper ﬂuid is withdrawn. When Q is increased (or S
decreased), the interface undergoes a transition so that the lower ﬂuid is
entrained with the upper one, forming a thin steady-state spout. Near this
transition the hump curvature becomes very large and displays power-law
scaling behavior. This scaling allows for steady-state hump proﬁles at
diﬀerent ﬂow rates and tube heights to be scaled onto a single similarity
proﬁle. I show that the scaling behavior is independent of the viscosity
ratio.

1 Introduction

A look at Edgerton’s photographic sequences of dripping faucets (see, for ex-
ample,Edgerton et al. (1937)) should instantly convince any skeptic that there
is something fascinating about a ﬂuid interface changing its topology which
hints at the richness of the underlying physics. Much attention has been de-
voted towards trying to classify these topological transitions in ﬂuid systems
(see, Caﬂisch & Papanicolaou (1993); Bertozzi et al. (1994); Goldstein et al.
(1993); Pugh & Shelley (1998)) in the same manner as one classiﬁes thermo-
dynamic transitions. It has been shown that when the topological transition
involves the formation of a singularity in the ﬂuid ﬂows or interface shapes, as
is the case with a drop dripping from a faucet, one can use the singularity to
organize studies of the transition systematically (see, for example, Barenblatt
(1996); Lister & Stone (1998); Cohen & Nagel (2001)). As the singularity is ap-
proached, the separation between the length scales characterizing the boundary
conditions and the length scales characterizing the system grows. Furthermore,
the ﬂuid systems can enter an asymptotic regime where a subset of the terms in
the governing equations dominate the ﬂows. The organization of the transition
studies involves the identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent subsets of terms which can bal-
ance as the singularity is approached. In these asymptotic regimes, the systems

1

typically display scaling of length scales or other physical quantities and often,
the interfacial proﬁles near the singularity can all be collapsed onto a universal
curve. In many systems these singularities manifest themselves in the transition
dynamics (see, Lister & Stone (1998); Bensimon et al. (1986); Nagel & Odder-
shede (2000); Zeﬀ et al. (2000).) Here, this approach is extended to the study
of the steady-state interface proﬁles near the topological transition associated
with the industrially important (see, for example, Muskat (1972); Bear (1972);
Cohen et al. (2001); Ganan-Calvo (1998)) process of selective withdrawal.

In the selective withdrawal experiment a tube is immersed in a ﬁlled con-
tainer so that its tip is suspended a height S above an interface separating two
immiscible ﬂuids (ﬁgure 1). When ﬂuid is pumped out through the tube at low
ﬂow rates, Q, only the upper ﬂuid is withdrawn. The ﬂows deform the interface
into an axi-symmetric steady-state hump with a stagnation point at the hump
tip (Fig. 1). The hump grows in height and curvature as Q increases (or S
decreases) until the ﬂows undergo a transition where the lower ﬂuid becomes
entrained in a thin axi-symmetric spout along with the upper ﬂuid. The inter-
face becomes unbounded in the vertical direction, the stagnation point moves
from the hump tip into the interior of the lower ﬂuid, and the upper ﬂuid ge-
ometry becomes toroidal thus changing the topology of the steady state. Once
the spout has formed, an increase in Q (or decrease in S) causes the spout to
thicken.

Near the transition, the steady-state mean radius of curvature at the hump
tip, 1/κ, can be orders of magnitude smaller than the length scales characterizing
the boundary conditions (for example the tube diameter, D). However, for the
range of parameters explored thus far, even when the system is arbitrarily close
to the transition, κ, while large, remains ﬁnite. The manifestation of a true
singularity would entail the divergence or vanishing of some physical quantities
or length scales describing the system. In practice, for all physical systems the
approach to the singularity is cut oﬀ at some length scale. For the selective
withdrawal system where both ﬂuids have a viscosity of about 2 St, Cohen &
Nagel (?) show that the cutoﬀ appears when the mean radius of curvature at
the hump tip is about 200 µm which is well above the breakdown limit for the
Navier-Stokes equations. It is still unclear which physical parameters determine
this relatively large length scale for the hump mean radius of curvature cutoﬀ,
1/κu.

Nevertheless, ﬁxing S and looking at the steady-state proﬁles as Q is in-
creased, Cohen and Nagel observe that, up until the cutoﬀ, both the hump cur-
vature and height display scaling behavior characteristic of systems approaching
a singularity. Furthermore, they are able to use the observed scaling relations to
collapse the hump proﬁles near the transition onto a universal curve. In doing
so, they have shown that it is possible to treat this as a “weakly-ﬁrst-order” tran-
sition and use the same systematic approach others have successfully applied to
the study of the drop snap-oﬀ problem1. However, understanding how to con-

1While scaling has been hypothesized by Acrivos & Lo (1978) for an analogous 3-D system

it was never shown experimentally.

state interface at diﬀerent Q. Fluid is withdrawn from the withdrawal container
and deposited into a waste container. The upper ﬂuid is then siphoned back
into the withdrawal container. As shown in the diagram, the parameters for
this problem include the height of the tube from the interface, S, withdrawal
rate, Q, surface tension, γ, ﬂuid densities, ρu and ρl, ﬂuid viscosities, ηu and
ηl, tube diameter, D, ﬂuid height above the interface, Lu, ﬂuid height below
the interface, Ll, container size, and surfactant concentration. Viewed bottom
to top, the photographs show the evolution of the steady state interface as Q is
increased. The top photograph of the interface in the spout state is taken from
Cohen et al. (2001). The middle photograph of the hump at the transition ﬂow
rate is taken from Cohen & Nagel (?).

trol the cutoﬀ curvature is crucial for obtaining a more accurate scaling analysis.
Moreover, a precise understanding of the transition would allow for control of the
minimum spout diameter. This control could, in turn be used to advance new
emerging technologies such as coating micro-particles (Cohen et al. (2001)), cre-
ating mono-dispersed micro-spheres (Ganan-Calvo (1998)), and emulsiﬁcation
through tip streaming (Eggers (1997); Sherwood (1984)) which take advantage
of the selective withdrawal geometry.

Further insight into this cutoﬀ behavior is gained by comparing with an anal-
ogous two-dimensional (2-D) problem which roughly corresponds to replacing
the tube with a line sink. Jeong & Moﬀatt (1992) showed that in an idealized
case where the bottom ﬂuid is inviscid while the top ﬂuid is very viscous, the 2-
D hump interface forms a two-dimensional cusp singularity beyond suﬃciently
high withdrawal rates. Recently, Eggers (2001) showed that when the lower
ﬂuid has a ﬁnite viscosity, the solution to the governing equations changes and
the system no longer manifests a singularity. Instead, the approach to the sin-
gularity is cut oﬀ and the system undergoes a transition to a diﬀerent steady
state. In this new state, a sheet of the lower ﬂuid is entrained along with the
upper ﬂuid into the line sink. However, the ﬁnite lower ﬂuid viscosity prevents
the hump proﬁles from scaling onto a similarity solution. In contrast, Cohen
& Nagel (?) point out that even though they performed their experiments for
3-D selective withdrawal with an upper and lower ﬂuid which were comparably
viscous (about 2 St), they still observe scaling behavior and proﬁle collapse onto
a similarity solution. Whether or not performing the experiments with a lower
ﬂuid which is less viscous will allow the system to get closer to the singular-
ity (as is the case in the 2-D analogue) has so far remained a mystery. In the
present paper, a systematic analysis of the role which the lower ﬂuid viscosity,
ηl, plays in the selective withdrawal transition shows that neither ηl nor the
viscosity ratio aﬀect the scaling dependence of the hump proﬁles and the value
of the cut-oﬀ curvature κu.

In addition to studying the various scaling dependencies, Cohen & Nagel
(?) map out the location of the transition in the S vs. Q parameter space.
Indeed, this topic is by far the most common feature of the selective withdrawal
transition discussed in the literature. Yet, even this seemingly benign subject
has its subtleties. For example, the experiments of Blake & Ivey (1986), Jirka &
S. (1979), Harelman et al. (1959), and others used two ﬂuids which had diﬀerent
densities but were miscible. However, as pointed out by Lister (1989), when
surface tension is absent, there is always some fraction of the lower ﬂuid which
is extracted so that those experiments were not tracking the actual withdrawal
transition2. Cohen and Nagel’s studies of a pair of immiscible ﬂuids which are
comparable in their viscosity (about 2 St) are the ﬁrst to take into account the
eﬀects of the surface tension in experiments mapping out the transition location
for low Reynolds number ﬂow. In this paper, these studies are extended to other
ﬂuid combinations. Once again, I ﬁnd that neither ηl nor the viscosity ratio
2While these experiments did not track the transition, they may have been suﬃcient for

their intended purpose of modeling magma layer mixing during volcanic eruptions.

aﬀect the values of S and Q at which the transition occurs.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the ﬂuids and experi-
mental apparatus used to make the measurements. This section also describes
the eﬀects of the container walls and ﬂuid layer thickness on the transition.
Section 3 addresses the hysteretic nature of the transition. Also addresses is the
correlation between the amount of hysteresis and the ﬁnal value for the hump
curvature, κu, when the transition takes place at low enough values of S. In sec-
tion 4 a scaling analysis is performed for a system which is identical to that used
by Cohen and Nagel with the exception that the viscous lower ﬂuid is replaced
with one which is two hundred times less viscous. The two sets of results are
then compared. In section 5, I map out the location of the selective withdrawal
transition in the S vs. Q parameter space as a function of the upper and lower
ﬂuid viscosities. Also presented is a comparison of the experimental results with
the theoretical prediction of Lister (1989) for the transition dependence on the
parameters S and Q. Section 6 presents a discussion of the results. Finally, the
role of surfactants is addressed in Appendix A. Since it is extremely diﬃcult to
keep a ﬂuid interface free of surfactants it is important to isolate and control
their eﬀects. In the current studies the eﬀects on the experimental results are
found to be rather benign.

2 Characterization of Fluids and Experimental

Details

As shown in ﬁgure 1, the parameters important for this experiment are the
upper and lower ﬂuid viscosities and densities (νu, νl, ρu, ρl), the interfacial
tension (γ), the oriﬁce diameter (D), the height of the oriﬁce (S), the ﬂow rate
(Q), the ﬂuid height above the interface (Lu), the ﬂuid layer thickness below the
interface (Ll), the container size, and the surfactant concentration. In order to
look at the scaling of the steady-state proﬁles, care must be taken in designing
an experimental apparatus capable of isolating the proﬁles near the transition.
Figure 1 displays a diagram of the apparatus in which the experiments were
performed. A large tank (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) capable of holding ﬂuid
layers that were each about 12 cm in height is used as the withdrawal container
for the ﬂuids. During the experiments, ﬂuid is pumped out of the withdrawal
container and into a waste container. When the system is in the spout state the
ﬂuids enter the waste container as an emulsion. This emulsion is deposited at the
bottom of the waste container which is where the droplets comprised of the lower
ﬂuid remain. The upper ﬂuid is siphoned back into the withdrawal container
through large tubes at a rate which matches the withdrawal rate thereby keeping
constant the upper ﬂuid layer thickness in the withdrawal container. Note that
the bottom ﬂuid layer does not change its thickness when the system is in the
hump state and decreases its thickness with time when the system is in the
spout state. However, even for thick spouts (0.1 mm) and for large ﬂow rates
(10 ml/sec) the lower ﬂuid layer decreases its thickness at the very slow rate of

5

0.01 mm/min which corresponds to a 0.1% change in the straw height, S.

The ﬂuids were withdrawn using a B9000 Zenith metering gear pump at-
tached to a variable speed DC motor. A Dynapar Rotopulser encoder was used
to read out the withdrawal rate. The pump uses gears to displace ﬂuid from the
pump intake to the pump outlet. There are small variations in ﬂow rate associ-
ated with the ﬁlling and draining of the gaps between the gear teeth. However,
at large ﬂow rates, or equivalently at high rotation frequencies, these variations
damp out and the amplitude of the remaining noise corresponds to a very small
percentage of the total ﬂow rate. High rotation rates also average out the ﬂuc-
tuations in the driving motor. Using bigger or smaller pump attachments allows
for pumping of the ﬂuid at the same ﬂow rate but at a diﬀerent gear rotation
rate. This allows for the determination of the eﬀects of noise in the ﬂow rate on
the transition. A further reduction of the noise in the experiments is achieved
by siphoning the ﬂuids into the waste container. However, when siphoning,
the maximum rate of withdrawal (determined by the viscosity, straw diameter,
transfer tube length, transfer tube diameter, and ﬂuid height diﬀerence between
the withdrawal and waste containers) is substantially smaller.

The ﬂuids used were heavy mineral oil (HMO), light mineral oil (LMO), sil-
icone oil (polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS), salt water (Salt H2O), and mixtures
of glycerin and water (Water/Glycerin). No surface chemistry was observed at
the two-ﬂuid interfaces even when the liquids remained in contact for periods
longer than a month. However, a slight change in the transition ﬂow rate at
ﬁxed S over a period of days indicated that the surfactant concentration at the
interface was increasing with time. A detailed discussion of the surfactant eﬀects
appears in Appendix A. The viscosity, ν, was measured using calibrated Cannon
Ubbelohde viscometers immersed in a Cannon constant temperature bath. In
this manner the viscosity could be determined to within ±5%. Glycerin can be
diluted with water so that the resultant ﬂuid has 0.01 ≤ ν ≤ 9.8 St (Segur &
Oberstar (1951)). Table 1 lists the values of the viscosities and densities for the
diﬀerent ﬂuids.

The surface tension, γ, of the two-ﬂuid interface was determined using the
pendant drop method (see, for example, Neumann & Spelt (1995); Hansen &
Rodsrud (1991)) which takes advantage of the competition between the surface
tension and buoyant forces acting on a static drop hanging from a nozzle. The
buoyant forces distort the drop from a spherical shape. Measuring the distortion
and density mismatch allows a determination of the surface tension. Implemen-
tation of this technique on water, toluene, and di-methylformamide showed a
capability for measuring the surface tensions to within ±10%. Table 1 lists the
values of γ for the diﬀerent ﬂuids.

The apparatus was illuminated from the rear and a CCD video camera was
used to image silhouettes of the steady state hump shapes. The images were
transferred onto a PC where an edge tracing IDL program tracked and recorded
the points where the derivative of the pixel intensity proﬁle across the hump
interface was extremized. The proﬁles were then superimposed onto the original
images and checked for accuracy. In order to determine the mean curvature at
the hump tip, κ, a Gaussian function was used to ﬁt the tip of the recorded

list the ﬂuids used. Row 3 lists the symbols used in plotting the experimentally
measured Su curves in ﬁgures 12, 13, 4, and 6. Rows 4 through 10 list the values
of the ﬂuid parameters measured for the diﬀerent systems. The second to last

and the last row lists the power-law exponent α used in ﬁtting the experimentally
measured Su curves in ﬁgures 12, 13, 4, and 6

hump proﬁle. The value of κ is taken to be the curvature of the ﬁtting function
at the hump tip.

Using this apparatus, I tested the eﬀects of the container walls and thickness
of the upper ﬂuid layer on the transition ﬂow rate, Qu. Figure 2 shows a plot
of the transition ﬂow rate Qu vs. the distance Lw from one of the container
walls while the straw height, S, is held constant. The ﬂuid parameters for this
particular experiment correspond to those of system 3 in Table 1. When the
straw is farther than about 2 cm from the container wall, there is no variation
in the transition ﬂow rate. Figure 3 shows a plot of the transition ﬂow rate Qu
as a function of the upper ﬂuid layer thickness Lu for constant S. The ﬂuid
parameters for this particular experiment correspond to those of system 5 in
Table 1. As Lu is increased, Qu ﬁrst increases but eventually saturates and
remains constant for Lu greater than about 3cm. In all of the experiments, the
bottom ﬂuid layer thickness Ll was typically kept at about 12 cm. Measurements
of the transition ﬂow rates showed no signiﬁcant variations between systems with
an Ll of 12, 10, and 6 cm. Similar measurements for the Qu dependence on Lw,
Lu, and Ll were conducted for all of the diﬀerent ﬂuid combinations used in the
experiments. For the tube diameters (D = 0.16 cm and D = 0.79 cm), tube
heights (0.07 cm < S < 2.0 cm), and ﬂow rates (Q < 20 ml/sec) used in the
experiments, the container walls were always suﬃciently distant and the ﬂuid
layers were always suﬃciently thick so as not to aﬀect the ﬂows.

3 Transition Structure and Hysteresis

In their paper, Cohen & Nagel (?) map out the location and structure of the
selective withdrawal transition for a pair of ﬂuids corresponding to system 6 in
table 1. Here I review these results and note that all of the ﬂuid systems in
table 1 display the same qualitative features. Much of our understanding of the
selective withdrawal transition can be conveyed by focusing on the eﬀects of
the parameters S and Q. By ﬁxing Q and tracking the hump proﬁles the tube
height below which the interface forms a spout, Su, can be determined. Figure
shows that Su ∝ Q0.30±0.05 (A detailed
4(taken from Cohen & Nagel (?))
discussion of how this result changes with the various ﬂuid parameters along
with a comparison to currently available theory is presented in section 5). As
mentioned in the introduction, for the entire range of parameters explored thus
far, the evolution of the steady state hump proﬁles is cut oﬀ by the hump to
spout transition before κ diverges. However it is possible that there is more
than one mechanism that is responsible for the transition cutoﬀ. If this is the
case it is important to isolate the regimes over which particular mechanisms
dominate. The cut-oﬀ suggests that the transition may be hysteretic. Indeed,
for transitions occurring at low Q, or equivalently at small Su, the straw height
at which the spout decays back into a hump is diﬀerent from Su. The diﬀerence
of the two heights or hysteresis is deﬁned as ∆S. Figure 4 shows that ∆S
decreases exponentially with the ﬂow rate Q. For this particular system the
hysteresis can be ﬁt with the function: ∆S = 0.04 exp−Q/0.032. For Q > 0.1
ml/sec, ∆S was too small to measure. Figure 4 also shows how the hump
mean radius of curvature, 1/κu, and height, hu, at the transition vary with
Q. The dramatic decrease in ∆S coincides with the onset of a ﬂat asymptotic
dependence for 1/κu at Q > 0.1 ml/sec. In order to quantify this correlation,
the curvature data is ﬁt with the form 1/κu = 0.02 + 0.32 exp−Q/0.032 which
has the same exponential decay with Q as does the hysteresis. The curvature
saturation values, κusat, for all of the systems are shown in the second to last
row in Table 1.

A diagram (Hale & Cocak (1991)) summarizing the features of the transition
is shown in ﬁgure 5. The vertical axis labeled q relates how much of the lower
ﬂuid is withdrawn as a function of the total ﬂuid withdrawal rate Q and straw
height S. The states accessible to the system are represented by a sheet which
is embedded in this three dimensional parameter space. The part of the sheet
which corresponds to the system in the hump state is located in the q = 0
plane. An experiment where the ﬂow rate is held ﬁxed and the straw height
is slowly reduced would correspond to a path which traverses the sheet in a
direction which is parallel to the S axis. The fold in the sheet represents the
hysteresis in the transition. As the straw height is reduced, the system runs out
of hump states and makes a discontinuous jump at S = Su (depicted by the
dashed arrow pointing upward) to a part of the sheet which has a ﬁnite value
of q. If S is reduced further, the sheet slopes towards higher values of q and
more of the lower ﬂuid is withdrawn. If on the other hand, S is increased, the
system remains on the upper branch of the sheet until the spout states run out

Figure 5: Bifurcation diagram summarizing the features of the selective with-
drawal transition. The vertical axis labeled q depicts the amount of the lower
ﬂuid withdrawn as a function of the withdrawal rate Q and straw height S. The
folded two dimensional sheet represents the states which are accessible to the
system. The fold represents the amount of hysteresis in the transition which
becomes too small to measure at large enough Q and S.

It is unclear whether at high enough Q or S the system undergoes a bifur-
cation where the hysteresis vanishes, or if there always remains some small fold
It seems
in the sheet which is too small to be detected by the experiments.
unlikely that the transition could have a cut-oﬀ (and remain discontinuous) and
yet have no hysteresis. Such a situation would entail the disappearance of the
hump solutions at the exact location in the parameter space where the spout
solutions emerge. It is likely that numerical investigations which are able to
detect both stable and unstable solutions will be needed in order to answer this
question deﬁnitively. The exponential decay in both the ∆S and 1/κu curves
suggests that even if there does exists a small amount of hysteresis at large S
or Q, there is a separate and localized mechanism that generates the transition
hysteresis at low values of S or Q.

When transitions occur at low S or Q, the ratio of the withdrawal tube di-
ameter, D, over the straw height, S, is of order one. As a result, the circulation
rolls set up by withdrawal press against the two-ﬂuid interface and the stream-
lines near the hump tip become distorted. By changing the ﬂow geometry, the
straw diameter sets a length scale for the hump mean radius of curvature at the
transition, 1/κu. Figure 6 shows the eﬀect of a factor of ﬁve increase in D on the
Su and 1/κu curves. For the range of ﬂow rates explored, ∆S is always about

11

an order of magnitude smaller than Su. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
two Su curves in ﬁgure 6 show no signiﬁcant dependence on D. On the other
hand, the 1/κu data show that the onset of the ﬂat asymptotic dependence for
1/κu occurs at higher Q for larger straw diameters. This evidence indicates
that the hysteresis observed in the experiments results from the ﬁnite width of
the withdrawal tube. At large values of Su these ﬁnite size eﬀects vanish. We
therefore restrict our scaling analysis to this regime.

4 Scaling Analysis And Similarity Solutions

Although the cut-oﬀ in the transition exists even for high values of Q, Cohen
& Nagel (?)
showed that the separation in length scales between the hump
radius of curvature and the boundary conditions is suﬃcient for the system to

12

display scaling and a similarity solution near the transition. As mentioned in
the introduction, in the 2-D analogue to the selective withdrawal problem the
viscosity of the lower ﬂuid, νl, greatly aﬀected the observed scaling dependencies.
In order to determine the eﬀects of νl on the transition structure in the present
3-D problem, a comparison of the scaling behavior for two systems with diﬀerent
values of νl is presented below.

Figure 7 reproduces the Cohen and Nagel scaling curves for the hump cur-
vature and height for system 6 while ﬁgure 8 shows the results of an identical
treatment performed on data taken for system 5 (where νl is two hundred times
smaller). Figures 7a and 8a, show a plot of the mean curvature at the hump tip,
κ (where 0 ≤ κ ≤ κu), as a function of Q for six representative data sets each
of which corresponds to measurements taken at a diﬀerent ﬁxed straw height S.
All of the curves display a steep rise in the curvature with increasing Q. The
insets to ﬁgures 7a and 8a show that, as the ﬂow rate approaches Qc (used as a
ﬁtting parameter), the steep rise in the curvatures takes the form of power-law
divergences with exponents of about -0.84 and -0.80 respectively. For each ﬂuid
system, all of the data sets (15 sets for large νl system and 20 for low νl system)
have the same power-law exponent for the divergence. However, the power-law
prefactors, cκ(S), change with S. These prefactors are scaled out in the insets
for clarity.

Figures 7b and 8b, show a plot of the hump height, hmax (where 0 ≤ hmax ≤
hu), as a function of Q for six data sets each of which corresponds to measure-
ments taken at a diﬀerent ﬁxed straw height S. The insets to ﬁgures 7b and 8b
show that as the ﬂow rate approaches Qc (obtained from insets to ﬁgures 7a and
8a), the hump heights approache the height hc (used as a ﬁtting parameter) as
power-laws with exponents of about 0.73 and 0.70 respectively. While the curves
for each ﬂuid system show that hmax approaches hc with the same power-law
exponent, the power-law prefactors ch(S) change with S. These prefactors are
scaled out in the insets for clarity.

We combine the two scaling dependencies in ﬁgures 7c and 8c and plot
n . The normalization con-
stant, n, scales out the power-law prefactors for curves corresponding to dif-
ferent straw heights. The two ﬁgures show that hc−hmax
n )β where
β = −0.85 ± 0.09 for the high νl system and β = −0.86 ± 0.10 for the low νl
system. These results indicate that for this range of straw heights, both ﬂuid
systems show no change in the power-law exponent −β even though the height
hc and the power-law prefactor n change with S.

hmax

Note that n(S) = ch(S)[ck(S)β]. The constants n(S) decreases roughly as
exp−2.5S for both systems. While both systems have the same form for the de-
cay of the constants n(S), in the lower νl system, the values of n(S) are larger
by about ten percent. Also, as indicated by table 1 , the asymptotic value of
ku at the high Q regime is diﬀerent by about a factor of 1.5. A detailed anal-
ysis of table 1 described in Section 6 suggests that these very slight diﬀerences
are attributable the diﬀerent values ∆ρ in the two systems. This comparison
demonstrates that the lower ﬂuid viscosity νl does not aﬀect the scaling relations
near the selective withdrawal transition.

Figure 8: Scaling for the hump mean curvature, κ, and height hmax. Figure8a
plots the κ vs. Q for six tube heights. Each curve displays diverging behavior
with increasing Q. For each tube height, a critical ﬂow rate, Qc, is chosen
as a ﬁtting parameter so that as Q approaches Qc, the curvatures increase as
power laws with an exponent of about -0.80 (8a inset). The prefactors to the
curvature power laws, cκ(S), are scaled out in the inset. Figure 8b plots hmax
vs. Q for six tube heights. For each S, a critical hump height, hc, is chosen as a
ﬁtting parameter. As the ﬂow rate approaches Qc (obtained from 8a inset), the
hump heights approach the critical heights as power-laws with an exponent of
about 0.70. The prefactors, ch(S), to the power laws in the inset are scaled out.
Figure 8c plots (hc − hmax)/hmax vs. κ/n for the entire data set corresponding
to twenty diﬀerent straw heights. The prefactor n roughly decreases as exp−2.5S.
The line corresponds to a power-law with an exponent of -0.86.

The scaling analysis shows that the hump proﬁles behave as though they
are approaching a singular solution where, at the ﬂow rate Qc the hump height
would be equal to hc and the mean curvature, κ, would diverge. The transition
cuts oﬀ the evolution of the hump states preventing the system from getting
arbitrarily close to the singularity and limiting the precision with which the
power-law exponents can be determined. Qc changes with S indicating that the
system can approach a continuous line of singularities which closely tracks the
hump to spout transition curve in the S vs. Q parameter space.

Cohen & Nagel (?) showed that the scaling relations for the hump height
and curvature can be used to collapse the hump proﬁles near the transition onto
a universal curve . The quantities n
track how quickly the radial
and axial length scales decrease as the system approaches the singularity. In
accordance with the deﬁnitions of Cohen and Nagel, the scaled variables are
deﬁned as:

κ and hc−hmax

hmax

H(R) =

hc − h(r)
hc − hmax

and

R =

rκ
n

,

(1)

Here h(r) is the hump proﬁle and the value of hc is taken from the scaling
relations. This transformation shifts and scales the proﬁles so that the singu-
larity is located at the origin and the maximum hump heights are located at
H = 1 and R = 0. Figure 9 reproduces the similarity analysis of Cohen and
Nagel (system 6) for the hump proﬁles near the transition while ﬁgure 10 shows
the results of an identical treatment performed on data taken for the small νl
system (system 5).

Figures 9 and 10 show a series of eight scaled proﬁles for the S = 0.830 cm
data set in the large νl system and the S = 0.667 cm data set in the small νl
system. The bottom insets in the ﬁgures show an overlay of the diﬀerent hump
proﬁles which are scaled in the main ﬁgures. Both ﬁgures display excellent
collapse for the hump proﬁles. The solid lines are power-laws which ﬁt the scaled
proﬁles in the region beyond the parabolic hump tips. The scaling relation in
ﬁgures 7 and 8 can be used to predict the exponent, x, in the power-law ﬁts.
Inserting the observed scaling dependence hc−hmax
n )β into the observed
form H(R) = Rx which ﬁts the proﬁle, the following relation is obtained:

= ( κ

hmax

hc − h(r)
hmax

(

κ
n

)−β = rx(

)x.

κ
n

(2)

Since, for a given r, the functions hc−h(r)
and rx have constant values, x must
hmax
equal −β. More intuitively, as Q is increased, the parabolic tip regions decrease
their radial length scale and are simultaneously pulled towards the singularity
in the axial direction leaving behind power-law proﬁles with exponents that
reﬂect the rate at which these length scales are decreasing. The ﬁts to the
proﬁles indicate that x = 0.72 ± 0.08 and x = 0.72 ± 0.10 for the high and
low νl systems respectively. Both of these exponents are within error (although
slightly smaller) of the exponent observed in the scaling relation of ﬁgures 7 and
8 which, respectively, predict values of 0.85 ± 0.09 and 0.86 ± 0.10 for x.

16

Typically, the observed scaling dependencies in these types of problems result
from the local stress balance. A scaling analysis where the viscous stresses
of the upper and lower ﬂuids balance the stress arising from the interfacial
curvature predicts linear scaling dependencies and conical proﬁle shapes. The
non-linearity of the observed dependencies and the lack of dependence of the
similarity solution on νl indicate that a diﬀerent stress balance may govern the
ﬂows (e.g. only viscous stress due to upper ﬂuid balances stress due to the
interface curvature). Furthermore, non-local eﬀects coupling themselves into
the solution could account for the slight diﬀerences between the values of the
exponents β and x. Further evidence for the existance of these coupling eﬀects
is presented in section 6.

tors n(S) decrease roughly as exp−2.5S. Here, this decrease is correlated with
the observation that the proﬁles become shallower at larger S. The points of
deviations for the S = 0.255 cm and 0.381 cm proﬁles in the large νl system,
and the S = 0.445 cm proﬁle in the small νl system, mark the transition from
the similarity regime to the matching regime beyond which the proﬁles become
asymptotically ﬂat. At large enough radii all of the scaled proﬁles display these
deviations.

As a ﬁnal check, ﬁgure 11 shows a comparison of the similarity proﬁle for
S = 0.831 cm in the large νl system and the similarity proﬁle for S = 0.667
cm in the small νl system. An error analysis calculation3 for the data points
located between −5 < R < 5 (where the residuals are centered around zero -
see ﬁgure 11) shows that χ2 ≈ 1.6. This χ2 value indicates that the diﬀerences
between the two similarity curves are on the same order as the experimental
uncertainty which is taken to be a quarter of a scaled pixel. The excellent col-
lapse veriﬁes that νl and the viscosity ratio do not aﬀect the similarity solution
and emphasizes that the scaling behavior observed in these systems is robust.

5 Mapping Out The Transition Location

Having shown that the viscosity ratio does not aﬀect the scaling relations and
self-similarity characterizing the detailed structure of the transition, I return to
the question of whether Su is aﬀected by such a change in parameters. There is a
large body of work dating back to the late 1940’s (see, for example, Rouse (1956);
Gariel (1949); Craya (1949); Muskat (1972)) which addresses the mapping out
of the selective withdrawal transition location. A large portion of this work
focuses on the problem of extracting crude oil deposits without withdrawing
any of the water which is often trapped beneath the oil. Nearly all of the
experimental studies found in the literature which address these large scale
extraction problems assume that the ﬂows have a high Reynolds number or,
equivalently, that the viscous stresses are negligible. Therefore, low viscosity
ﬂuids were used to model the ﬂows. One exception arises in the modeling by
Blake & Ivey (1986) of magma layer mixing during volcanic eruptions. However,
as described earlier, miscible ﬂuids were used in those investigations. Since, as
Lister (1989) showed, the absence of surface tension allows for the withdrawal
of both ﬂuids at any withdrawal rate, these particular studies never addressed
the actual selective withdrawal transition. With the advent of new technologies

3Since the data points for both curves were not aligned, χ2 was calculated in the following
way: First a local linear ﬁt was used to interpolate the value of curve1 between the data
points. Second, the minimum distance between the interpolated curve and the value of the
points in curve2, δi,2 was calculated. The χ2 value for the entire curve is deﬁned as: χ2 =

Figure 12: Plots of the transition tube height Su as a function of Q for the seven
systems listed in table 1. Table 1 lists the symbol used in plotting the Su curve
for each system. For each system, it is observed that Su ∝ Qα where the power
α (listed in table 1) ranges between 0.30 and 0.45. The Su curves cluster into
three groups which correspond to the three diﬀerent upper ﬂuids used in the
experiments. Each cluster is labeled with the corresponding upper ﬂuid.

There are a few obvious trends. First, all of the data sets show that Su ∝ Qα
where the power α ranges between 0.30 and 0.45. The last row in Table 1
shows the value of the exponent for the power-law used to ﬁt the Su curves
for each system. Second, for a given value of Q, an increase in νu, the upper
ﬂuid viscosity, increases Su. The three distinct clusters of curves in ﬁgure 12
correspond to three distinct upper ﬂuid viscosities. As ﬁgure 12 shows, a ﬁve
fold increase in νu can increase Su by a factor of two. Third, for a given value of
Q, even a thousand fold increase in the lower ﬂuid viscosity does not signiﬁcantly

21

aﬀect Su. These last two observations indicate that it is the upper ﬂuid viscosity
rather than the viscosity ratio which aﬀects the transition location within the
S vs. Q parameter space.

The remaining trends in the data are weak. In order to ascertain the eﬀects of
the surface tension, γ, and density mismatch, ∆ρ on the transition straw height,
these parameters must be varied by large amounts. Unfortunately, reducing γ
below about 20 dynes/cm causes mixing of the ﬂuid layers and results in a
diﬀuse interface under high shear rates. Therefore it is very diﬃcult to vary γ
in the experiments by more than a factor of two. Another diﬃculty arises from
an inability to decouple the changes in these parameters for diﬀerent systems.
For example, when comparing systems 1 and 4, an order of magnitude increase
in ∆ρ is coupled with a factor of two decrease in γ. Since both ∆ρ and γ
act to stabilize the interface, the eﬀects due to these variations may cancel. A
further complication arises due to the eﬀect of surfactant concentration on the
interface. As will be discussed in Appendix A, the accumulation of surfactants
on the interface tend to shift Su by an amount which is comparable to the slight
shifts seen in top four curves (which form the uppermost cluster) in ﬁgure 12.
More careful measurements of Su are necessary in order to resolve these weaker
trends.

It is instructive to compare these results with currently available theoretical
predictions for the transition which take into account both the viscous stresses
and the surface tension. While there are no current numerical studies which
have been tailored to address this exact problem, the closest approximation to
such a treatment can be found in the Lister (1989) paper on selective with-
drawal for zero Reynolds number ﬂow. While his simulations were performed
for equal viscosity ﬂuids, the fact that the lower ﬂuid viscosity is irrelevant to
the transition location can be used to compare the simulations with the exper-
iments for which the ﬂuid viscosities are unequal. Since those simulations were
designed to address large scale magma ﬂows rather than the small scale ﬂuid
ﬂows found in the experiments, care must be taken in making a comparison
of the results. For example, the simulations were designed to model a system
γ
with a point sink which is located many capillary lengths (deﬁned as q
∆ρg )
away from the interface. However in the experiments, S is comparable to the
capillary length. Thus, the experiments are performed at much smaller values of
Q and Su than the simulations making it impossible to quantitatively compare
the results. Nevertheless, since it is expected that Su is a smooth function of
Q, one can check that the two data sets are consistent with this expectation.

Another issue which needs to be addressed is the determination of the
Reynolds number for the experimental ﬂows. There are a variety of ways in
which the Reynolds number can be deﬁned. The greatest change in the velocity
of the upper ﬂuid occurs along the line connecting the tip of the hump and the
withdrawal tube. Since the ﬂuid at the tip of the hump is stationary the magni-
π(D/2)2 . The distance of the tube oriﬁce to the
tude of this change in velocity is
interface is the largest length scale aﬀecting the ﬂows4. Therefore, the quantity

Remax =
π(D/2)2ν can be used as an upper bound for the Reynolds number.
In ﬁgure 12, the upper most cluster of Su curves has 0.005 < Remax < 6, the
middle cluster of curves has 0.03 < Remax < 50, and the lowest curve has
0.05 < Remax < 350. These estimates imply that a comparison with results
from a zero Reynolds number simulation must be treated with caution. For
example, the eﬀects of the ﬂuid’s inertia could manifest themselves as a change
in α, the value of the exponent for the power-law ﬁts in ﬁgure 12 5. Such an ex-
planation could account for the decrease in α which occurs when νu is decreased
from 10 St to 1.9 St. However, since an equally large change in Reynolds num-
ber can occur along the Su versus Q curves it is curious that kinks which may
be indicative of such a change are not observed.

In ﬁgure 13 the Su vs. Q curves are compared with the predictions of Lister
for systems with νu = 10 St, νu = 1.9 St, and νu = 0.57 St corresponding
to systems 4, 6 and 7 in table 1. The solid and open symbols denote data
from the experiments and simulations respectively. The dashed lines represent
power-law ﬁts to the experimental results. These ﬁts are projected into the
regime for which the simulations have a prediction for the value of Su. Since
Lister’s simulations were performed using dimensionless variables, the proper
values for the ﬂuid parameters were used to determine the values of S and Q.
Furthermore, the simulation ﬂow rate is reduced by a factor of two in order to
make a ﬁrst order correction for the fact that the simulations use a point sink
rather than a tube to withdraw the ﬂuids.

There are two features of the comparison which need be addressed. First,
the simulations curves for the νu = 10 St system fall below the projected power-
laws. In Section 3 evidence was provided for the lack of dependence of Su on the
straw diameter D for the range of ﬂow rates used in the experiments. Therefore
it is unclear whether geometric factors alone could account for the large shift
which is necessary for the collapse of the numerical results onto the projected
experimental power-laws. Second, it is disturbing that the power-law exponents
for the systems which use less viscous (rather than more viscous) upper ﬂuids
agree more favorably with the zero Reynolds number simulation results. As
stated above, the shift in the power-law exponent for the experimental results
indicates that there may be more than one way to balance the stresses acting
on the interface. The simulation results only address the regime where surface
tension and buoyancy eﬀects play an equal role in stabilizing the interface and
therefore do not observe the change in the S vs. Q power-law exponents6.
Nevertheless, the fact that the simulations predict a power law exponent of one
third and the fact that the experimentally measured exponents are centered
around this value deserves notice.

Finally, it is often possible to use the scaling relations observed in systems
approaching a singularity to help identify which stresses are balancing each
other. Such an identiﬁcation for the diﬀerent ﬂuid systems could in turn help

little smaller than S. However, it is conceivable that for a set of density matched ﬂuids or for
measurements at very small S the capillary length could become larger than S.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, it has been shown that the transition straw height for a given
ﬂow rate, Su, changes as: Su ∝ Qα, where α ranges between about 0.45 and
0.30. This is the ﬁrst instance in which experiments comparing Su for diﬀerent
systems of immiscible ﬂuids with ﬂows in the low Reynolds number regime have
been performed. The data indicates that for the selective withdrawal system,
the upper ﬂuid viscosity rather than the viscosity ratio determines the value of
Su. It has been shown, that when the withdrawal tube is suﬃciently close to
the interface, the transition is hysteretic: the straw height at which the spout
collapses back into a hump is diﬀerent from Su. At larger straw heights, the
diﬀerence between Su and the spout to hump transition straw height, ∆S, decays
exponentially. This eﬀect has been linked to the tube diameter which at low S,
sets a length scale for the ﬁnal mean radius of curvature 1/κu. However, the
transition remains discontinuous and κu remains ﬁnite even at large S.

I have performed a detailed comparison of the scaling relations for two sys-
tems which have the same upper ﬂuid viscosity but have a lower ﬂuid viscosity
which is diﬀerent by a factor of two hundred. The surface tension for the two
systems was diﬀerent by about 13% while the density mismatch was diﬀerent
by a factor of three (See systems 5 and 6 in table 1). It is observed that up until
the cutoﬀ, the hump proﬁles behave as though they are approaching a singular
solution where, at the ﬂow rate Qc the hump height would be equal to hc and
the mean curvature, κ, would diverge. The quantity hc−hmax
hmax has been shown to
scale as ( k
n )β where β = −0.85±0.09 for the high νl system and β = −0.86±0.10
for the low νl system. These scaling relation were used to collapse the hump
proﬁles for diﬀerent ﬂow rates and straw heights near the transition onto a sin-
gle universal curve. The region of the similarity proﬁles located beyond the
parabolic tip can be ﬁt with a power law which has an exponent x = 0.72 for
both systems. The results show that both the scaling exponents and the shape
of the similarity solution are independent of νl and the viscosity ratio. In fact,
a direct comparison of the similarity solution for both ﬂuid systems indicates
that, within error, the curves are identical.

As described in the introduction, in the 2-D analogue to the selective with-
drawal problem the lower ﬂuid viscosity plays a fundamental role in determining
how close the system can approach the cusp singularity. In the 3-D selective
withdrawal system, the asymptotic value of κu shows little or no dependence on
νl. Therefore, the eﬀects of the lower ﬂuid viscosity must enter as higher order
terms which are undetected by the experiments. Since κu is independent of the
Q
r2 /γ can also be
ﬂow rate at large S, an increase in the Capillary number, νu
ruled out as a method of getting the system closer to the singularity.

The saturation value of the mean curvature, κusat does show some depen-
dence on the upper ﬂuid viscosity νu. For example, systems 5 and 7 in table 1
show that when γ and ∆ρ are kept constant, decreasing νu from 2.0 St to 0.57

25

St, decreases κusat by a factor of six. However, as systems 2 and 5 in the table
indicate, this trend is not uniform. Shallow hump proﬁles are also observed for
nearly inviscid systems which use air as the upper ﬂuid and water as the lower
ﬂuid. Therefore, it is likely that one of the ways in which nuu can aﬀect κusat
is by shifting the balance between the viscous and inertial terms in the gov-
erning Navier-Stokes equations. For the remaining systems which have a lower
Reynolds number characterizing the ﬂows, even a factor of ﬁve increase in nuu
does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect κusat.

Since at low enough Reynolds numbers the ﬂuid viscosities do not aﬀect
κusat, the only remaining parameters which may act to set the length scale
for the cutoﬀ are the density mismatch ∆ρ and surface tension γ. With the
exception of systems 1 and 6, the large error in the data makes it diﬃcult to
distinguish between the κusat values for the diﬀerent systems. Also, the trends
in the data are too weak to allow for a determination of the eﬀects of γ on κusat.
However, a comparison of system 1 with systems 2, 3, and 4 and a comparison
of system 6 with system 5 indicates that an increase in ∆ρ results in a higher
value for κusat. Note that for both comparisons νu is kept constant. This
result is intriguing since the similarity treatment for the proﬁles is localized to
the hump tip whereas the eﬀects of the density mismatch should only aﬀect
γ
the system on a length scale comparable to the capillary length q
∆ρg . These
observations suggest that the matching region which connects the proﬁle near
the tip of the hump to the ﬂat interface at large radii is responsible for setting
the length scale for the cutoﬀ 7. Such an eﬀect could also explain the slight
diﬀerence between the observed value of the power-law exponent describing the
similarity solution(x) and the value predicted by the scaling relations(β). The
importance of identifying which parameters determine the length scale for the
cutoﬀ warrants a more careful investigation of the kusat dependence on ∆ρ, γ
and the local interfacial boundary conditions.

The robustness of the similarity analysis shows that singularities can be used
to organize the study and classiﬁcation of the steady state hump proﬁles near
the selective withdrawal transition. In particular, the discontinuous nature of
the transition, marked by the cut-oﬀ curvature κu, coupled with the display
of scaling behavior suggests a transition structure which is remarkably similar
to that of weakly-ﬁrst-order thermodynamic transitions. Whether this analogy
hints at some deeper relationship between the classiﬁcation schemes for weakly
ﬁrst order thermodynamic transitions and those for these types of topological
transitions remains to be shown.

A Surfactant eﬀects

Surfactants are chimeric molecules consisting of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
sections which tend to aggregate at ﬂuid interfaces8. Even under very controlled
conditions, it is diﬃcult to keep ﬂuid systems free of surfactants for long periods
of time. Since, surfactants can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the interfacial tension and
surface ﬂows, part of understanding the details of any ﬂuid interface problem
entails isolating and accounting for the eﬀects of surfactants.

In the present studies there are two types of eﬀects which are thought to
result from the presence of surfactants. First, for a given ﬂow rate, it is observed
that over a period of several days, Su increases by a small amount indicating that
the surface tension in the system may have been uniformly reduced. Second,
at the transition, the system oscillates between the hump state and the spout
state over a period of about minute9 in a manner similar to that observed by
de Bruijn (1993) in tip streaming of drops under shear ﬂow. In the tip streaming
experiments, a straining ﬂow stretches a drop of ﬂuid so that the two tips of the
drop (each of which is analogous to the hump tip) have a high curvature. At
suﬃciently high shear rates the drop can enter the streaming state (analogous
to the spout state) where a small jet of ﬂuid eminates from each of the drop
tips.
It is observed that near the transition the drops oscillate between the
stretched drop state and the streaming state. This oscillatory behavior has been
linked to the accumulation of surfactants near the stagnation point located at
the drop tip. This accumulation lowers the local surface tension and causes a
transition to the streaming state. The jet “sweeps” the interface, reduces the
local concentration of surfactants, and subsequently collapses back into the drop
state at which point the cycle begins again. While the local boundary conditions
for this problem are diﬀerent from those of the selective withdrawal problem,
the ﬂow patterns are remarkably similar indicating that the oscillatory behavior
observed in both systems may be correlated. Below, I explain how both of these
eﬀects inﬂuence the results presented in the main body of this paper.

Figure 14 shows plots of Su vs. Q for three data sets corresponding to
measurements performed on system 6. The ﬁlled down-triangles correspond
to measurements taken just after the ﬂuid interface was cleaned10. The open
down-triangles, correspond to measurements of Su taken after the surfactant
8For some oil-oil (for example Polybutadiene and PDMS) interfaces the random thermal
energy is able to keep the surfactants oﬀ the interface. However these systems usually have a
very low surface tension and therefore develop diﬀuse interfaces under high shear rates.

9Note that the time scale for this eﬀect is much larger than the time scale for the pump
induced noise in the withdrawal rate which can produce a similar eﬀect when the system is
very close to the transition.

10When the system is in the spout state, surfactants, which have accumulated on the inter-
face are “swept” into the straw and deposited in the waste container. By leaving the system in
the spout state for long periods of time, the surfactant concentration over the entire interface
can be signiﬁcantly reduced.

concentration at the interface was allowed to equilibrate for a period of a week.
A uniform 20% increase in Su, or, equivalently, a 50% decrease in the transition
ﬂow rate is observed. Upon cleaning the interface once again, the Su data points
return to their original value (open diamonds). Note that the observed shift in
Su resulting from the diﬀering surfactant concentration is quite small compared
with the shift observed when νu is increased by a factor of ﬁve. Nevertheless,
the fact that the transition ﬂow rate can change by nearly 50% depending on
the surfactant concentration is noteworthy. Finally, in ﬁgure 15, a comparison
between the hc−hmax
n curves for the equilibrated system (squares) and
the clean system (open circles) indicates that the shift in Su does not aﬀect the
scaling relations.

lowed to equilibrate over a period of a week. The open diamonds correspond to

While the increase in the Su values is most likely due to a uniform reduction
in γ over the entire interface, the dynamic nature of the observed hump to
spout oscillations implies that (as with tip streaming) the ﬂows may cause local
variations in the surfactant concentration. In this picture, when the system is
in the hump state, surfactants are dragged towards the hump tip by the surface

which lowers the surface tension locally, causes the hump to increase its height
and curvature and ultimately drives the system into the spout state. Once in

system eventually decays back into the hump state. The detailed characteristics
of this cyclical behavior depend on the surfactant concentration over the entire
interface.

When the entire interface has been cleaned, it takes a long time for the sur-
factants to accumulate in concentrations large enough to aﬀect the steady state.
Therefore, the increase in the hump curvature and height is slow. Furthermore,
once the interface forms a spout, it takes a very short amount of time for the
local concentration of surfactants to be reduced. Consequently, systems that
have been cleaned spend a very small fraction of the hump to spout oscillation
cycle in the spout state. Since many of the measurements discussed in the paper
were performed in the vicinity of the transition, care needed to be taken when
measuring the hump height and curvature. In order to understand how hmax
and κ change with time, the following experiment was performed. First, the
system was placed in the hump state. Then, the ﬂow rate was increased mo-
mentarily so that the interface formed a spout for a short period of time. Just
after spout collapse, the time dependence of the hump curvature and height was
measured. Figures 16a and 16b show the results of measurements performed
for the same system, with the same value of S, but at diﬀerent values of Q.
The initial decay, which occurs over a time scale of about ﬁve seconds, gives
some measure of the relaxation time for the ﬂows in these systems. Following
this initial decay, the height and curvature values plateau. These plateaus are
associated with a regime where the local surfactant concentration is too low to

29

aﬀect the shape of the interface. When the system is near the transition so that
Qc−Q
≈ 0.004, the plateau regime is short lived (about ﬁfteen seconds) and is
Q
followed by a regime in which both the height and curvature increase their val-
ues (ﬁgure 16a). However, when the experiments are performed at larger values
Q the plateau regime is longer. Figure 16b shows that when Qc−Q
of Qc−Q
≈ 0.01
the plateau regime lasts for over twenty minutes.

Q

When collecting data for the scaling relations, it is important to determine
the value of the hump height and mean curvature in the plateau regime. Also,
a larger amount of error must be assigned to data points taken from plateau
regimes that are short lived. Note however that since the plateau regime length-
ens quite rapidly as Qc−Q
is increased, for the cleaned interface, these precau-
tions only apply to the one or two data points in the scaling relations, which
are closest to the transition.

Q

While all of the scaling data presented in the main body of this paper was
taken for clean interfaces, it is useful to understand the changes in the transition
structure which occur when the surfactant concentration has been allowed to
equilibrate over a period of days. For equilibrated interfaces the increase in
the hump height and curvature occurs over a shorter amount of time so that
the plateau regimes shorten. Therefore, greater caution needs to be taken in
the measurements of the scaling relations. However as ﬁgure 15 shows, when
such precautions are taken no noticeable changes in the scaling relations are
observed.

Another characteristic of the equilibrated systems, is that (unlike the cleaned
systems) they can spend a large fraction of the hump to spout oscillation cycle in
the spout state. During the time which the system spends in the spout state, it
is possible (even at high Q or S) to quickly raise the straw and cause the spout
to collapse back into the hump state11. The amount ∆S necessary to cause
the collapse can be measured. I ﬁnd that the value of ∆S varies depending on
conditions. For example, if the ∆S measurement is performed just after the
local concentration of surfactants has been reduced, only a small amount of
hysteresis is observed. On the other hand if the experiment is performed after
the concentration of surfactants has been allowed to build up, ∆S can become
as large as 80 µm. Note that even this large amount of hysteresis is orders of
magnitude smaller than the typical value of the straw height and therefore does
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the Su vs. Q curves for the equilibrated system.

In conclusion, it is observed that allowing the surfactant concentration to
equilibrate over a period of days has a relatively small eﬀect (20% increase) on
the Su measurements (ﬁgure 14) and, when the propper precautions are taken,
no eﬀect on the scaling relations (ﬁgure 15).

11Since the spout drains the lower ﬂuid, the straw height S increases with time. Therefore,
it is necessary to check that the amount of hysteresis is actually larger than the increase in S
which occurs during the time it takes to perform the measurement.

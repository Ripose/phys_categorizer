The propagation of surface water waves over rough topographical bottoms is investigated by the
multiple scattering theory. It is shown that the waves can be localized spatially through the process
of multiple scattering and wave interference, a peculiar wave phenomenon which has been previously
discussed for frozen light in optical systems (S. John, Nature 390, 661, (1997)). We demonstrate
that when frozen, the transmission of the waves falls oﬀ exponentially, and a cooperative behavior
appears, fully supporting previous predictions. A phase diagram method is used to illustrate this
distinct phase states in the wave propagation.

PACS numbers: 47.10.+g, 47.11.+j, 47.35.+i.

Multiple scattering occurs when waves propagate in
media with scatterers, leading to many interesting phe-
nomena such as the bandgaps in periodically structured
media and Anderson localization in disordered media[1].
Within a bandgap, waves are evanescent; when localized,
they remain trapped spatially until dissipated. The phe-
nomenon of bandgaps and localization has been both ex-
tensively and intensively studied for electronic, electro-
magnetic, and acoustic systems[2].

Recently, Wiersma et al.[3] have demonstrated that
light can be forced to stand still in strongly scatter-
ing semiconductor powders. The authors have shown
a transmission transition from classical diﬀusion to lo-
calization. When localized, the optical transmission de-
cays exponentially instead of linearly with the thickness
of a sample. At the transition, the transmission has a
power-law dependence on the inverse thickness. This ex-
periment not only leads to new applications[4] in opti-
cal data processing and laser action, but also sheds new
lights to the understanding of the Anderson localization
transition. Although regretfully not being shown by this
experiment, it has been further predicted by John[4] that
a coherent behavior should appear for localized waves. In
addition, in the classical diﬀusion through a scattering
medium, the intensity distribution will ﬂuctuate signiﬁ-
cantly due to wave interference, while the ﬂuctuation will
be reduced in the localized state.

Here we report that the Anderson localization phe-
nomenon may also be observed for the surface water wave
propagation over random bottoms, also termed as grav-
ity waves in ﬂuid mechanics. We show that gravity waves
can come to a complete halt in the presence of random
multiple scattering and wave interference. In the local-
ized state, not only the wave intensity decreases exponen-
tially in agreement with the observation in Ref. [3], but
also a distinct phase coherence behavior prevails. The

transition from the diﬀusive to localization regime is sig-
niﬁed by the variations in the ﬂuctuation of the trans-
mission. The localization regime overlaps partially with
the bandgap of corresponding regularly structured bot-
toms. These observations fully support the predictions in
Ref. [4], indicating that these phenomena are a generic
property of waves.

The propagation of water waves over topographical
bottoms has actually been a subject of much research,
from both ocean engineering and fundamental research
perspectives (e. g. Refs. [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). A comprehensive
summary and reference can be found in excellent text-
books [10, 11, 12].

The concept of Anderson localization has also been
extended to the study of the propagation of surface wa-
ter waves over rough bottoms. In 1983, Guazzelli et al.
[13] suggested that the phenomenon of Anderson localiza-
tion could be observed on one dimensional shallow water
waves, when the bottom has random structures. Later,
Devillard et al. reconsidered the problem by the potential
theory [14]. The experimental observation of water wave
localization has been subsequently suggested by Belzone
et al.[15]. These earlier attempts have been limited to
the transmission measurement and to one dimension.

A recent experiment[16] has used water waves to illus-
trate the Bloch wave phenomenon over a two dimensional
periodic bottom. This pioneering experiment has made
it possible that the abstract concept be presented in an
unprecedentedly clear manner.

The experimental advantures[15, 16] pave a new av-
enue for investigating the phenomena of Anderson local-
ization in disordered media and wave bandgaps in peri-
odic structures. These developments are the motivation
for us to explore some important properties of Anderson
localization in the propagation of surface water waves
over random topographical bottoms.

Making the results experimentally testable, we will
adopt the systems from the experiment[16]. The con-
ceptual layout of the systems is illustrated in Fig. 1. We
consider a water column with a uniform depth H. There

are N cylindrical steps mounted on the water bottom.
For simplicity, the steps are assumed to be identical. The
heights of the steps are denoted by ∆H and the radii are
a; we can also extend to consider the situation of cylin-
drical dimples by letting ∆H < 0. For comparison, we
will consider both the randomly and the corresponding

the ordered case, the steps form a square lattice with the
lattice constant d; therefore the areal occupation fraction
by the steps is β = πa

are placed completely randomly within a circular area of
radius R. In both cases, the areal occupation fraction is

transmission is measured by a receiver located outside the

simulation, all lengths are scaled by the lattice constant
d. This is a two dimensional problem.

The governing equations for the motion of surface wa-
ter waves in the systems described by Fig. 1 can be ob-
tained by invoking the Newton’s second law and the con-

2

servation law of mass. The formulation has been given
in Ref. [16, 17] and the detailed derivation is given in
Ref. [18]. Here we only list the ﬁnal equations.

The displacement of the water surface is denoted by
η(~r, t). The equation of motion for its Fourier component
is derived as [16, 17, 18]

∇

k2 ∇η(~r)
(cid:19)

(cid:18)

+ η(~r) = −4πδ(~r − ~rs),

(1)

where ∇ = ∂x~ex + ∂y~ey, ~rs is the location of the trans-
mitting source, and the wavenumber k satisﬁes

ω2 = (gk(~r) + bk2(~k)) tanh(k(~r)h(~r)),

(2)

in which b is the capillary length. For a ﬁxed frequency ω,
the wavenumber varies as a function of the depth h(~r).
Without the steps, the wave ﬁeld is η0. We note that
Eq. (1) is derived when non-linear eﬀects are ignored.
The non-linearity may give rise to delocalization[9].

In this paper we will apply Eq. (1) to the systems de-
picted in Fig. 1. The transmitted waves will be scat-
tered repeatedly by the steps, forming an orchestral pat-
tern of multiple scattering. Such a multiple scattering
process can be solved for any arrangement of the steps
by the multiple scattering theory[18] following the work
of Twersky[19].
In the computation, the transmission
is normalized such that it is unity when there are no
scatterers, thus eliminates the trivial geometrical spread-
ing eﬀect In the periodic case, the plane wave expansion
method will be used to compute the band structures of
the water waves[18].

A set of numerical simulations has been carried out.
In the simulation, the following parameters are adopted
from the experiment[16]: the depth H = 2.5 mm; the
height of the cylinders ∆H = 2.49 mm; in the periodic
case, the lattice constant d = 2.5 mm; the radius of the
steps a = 0.75 mm; the capillary length b = 0.93 mm. In
the random case, the transmission intensity is averaged
over the random conﬁgurations.

First, in Fig. 2 we show the normalized intensity of
transmitted waves (|T |2 = |η/η0|2) as a function of fre-
quency, and the band structure of the corresponding
square arrays of the cylindrical steps. When computing
the transmission, the receiver is located at two lattice
constants away from the arrays. To ensure the stabil-
ity of the results, enough modes and number of steps
have been considered. For instance, the maximum mode
number and the maximum array size considered are 9 and
14×14 respectively. The wave transmission along the ΓX
direction is shown for the periodic case. The transmis-
sion through the random arrays of steps is also plotted.
In both cases, the source is placed in the middle of the
arrays.

Here we see that a complete bandgap region can be
identiﬁed as ranging from about 12.5 to 16 Hz. A strong
localization regime is shown to range from 10 to 14 Hz in

the random case. Though shallower, this regime overlaps
with the inhibition regime in the periodic case. By com-
parison, we see that although not exactly overlapping
with each other, the strong localization and complete
bandgap regime are close to each other; thus ﬁnding the
complete bandgaps will facilitate locating the localization
regimes, as suggested in Ref. [20]. We note here that in
the periodic case the inhibition regime in the transmis-
sion does not fully overlap with the complete bandgap.
This is because we have put the source inside the array.
When the transmission is measured across the sample,
i. e. the source is placed on one side of the sample and
the receiver is placed on the other, the two will overlap.

To show the conjectured frozen feature of localized
waves and ﬂuctuating feature of non-localized waves[4],
we have considered two frequencies: one is in the passing
band 5 Hz, and the other is with the complete bandgap
region, 11.966 Hz. We write the wave ﬁeld η(~r) as
|η(~r)|eiθ(~r). This allows us to separate the amplitude ﬁeld
and the phase ﬁeld of the waves. For the phase ﬁeld θ, we
deﬁne a unit phase vector ﬁeld as ~u = cos θˆex + sin θˆey.
Both phase vector ﬁeld and the wave intensity ﬁeld |η|2
can be plotted in the x − y plane. The signiﬁcance of
the phase vector ﬁeld is as follows. The intensity ﬂux of
surface water waves can be shown as ~j ∼ |η|2∇θ. It is
clear that when θ is constant, at least by spatial domains,
while |η| 6= 0, the wave transport would come to a stop
and the waves will be localized or frozen in the space.

In Fig. 3, the two-dimensional spatial distribution of
the normalized intensity |η/η0|2 and the phase vector
ﬁeld are plotted for the two frequencies. The phase vec-
tors are located randomly in the x − y plane. For f = 5
Hz, the intensity spreads spatially, meanwhile the phase
vectors point to various directions. This indicates that
waves are not yet localized at this frequency. The re-
sults in Fig. 3(b) nicely demonstrate the properties of

3

the localized or frozen waves. At f = 11.966 Hz, the
wave intensity is mainly conﬁned near the transmission
site. Meanwhile, there is an ordering in the phase vec-
tor ﬁeld, that is, all the phase vectors either point to the
same direction or the opposite direction, indicating that
the phase ﬁeld is constant by domains. Here we clearly
demonstrate that the localized waves behave as a stand-
ing wave in the random media. These observations fully
comply with the above general discussion of localization,
and also support the previous predictions. The intensity
distribution in Fig. 3 realizes remarkably well what has
been conjectured in Fig. 1 of Ref. [4]. We note that the
disorientation at the boundary is due to the ﬁnite size in
the simulation. For a ﬁnite system, the wave can leak out
at the boundary, resulting in disappearance of the phase
coherence. When enlarging the sample size, we observe
that the area showing the perfect phase coherence will in-
crease. We have further veriﬁed that the features shown
in Fig. 3 remain quantitatively the same for any other
random conﬁguration.

FIG. 3: The phase diagram and spatial distribution of the
intensity ﬁeld |η/η0|2 at two frequencies for one random con-
ﬁguration: (a1) and (a2) f = 5.0 Hz; (b1) and (b2) f =
11.966 Hz. Left panel: the phase diagram for the phase vec-
tors deﬁned in the text; here the phase of the source is set
to zero. Right panel: the intensity spatial distribution in the
horizontal plane.

We have also considered the ﬂuctuation in the trans-
mission. Fig. 4 plots the ﬂuctuation versus frequency for
the random case. The sample size R is about 9 d. Here we
see that the ﬂuctuation tends to be zero within a regime
which is consistent with the strong localization range dis-
cussed for Fig. 2. At around the localization transition
edges, signiﬁcant peaks in the transmission ﬂuctuation
appear. For extremely low frequencies, the ﬂuctuation
tends to disappear. This is because that at when the fre-

quency approaches zero, the scattering strength will di-
minish, and thus the wave propagation will be no longer
aﬀected by the steps.

To ﬁnd the localization length, we plot the wave trans-
mission in all directions as a function of the distance from
the source. The results are shown in Fig. 5. For compari-
son, the periodic case is also potted. Here, the simulation
data are shown by the black squares, and the results ﬁt-
ted by the least square method is shown by the solid lines;
the deviations from the lines reﬂect the inhomogeneity.
It is shown that after the removing the trivial geometri-
cal spreading factor, the data can be ﬁtted well by the
exponential function e−r/ξ. From the slopes of the solid
lines, we obtain the evanescence length in the ordered
case and the localization length in the random situation
respectively.

In summary, we have investigated the Anderson local-
ization phenomenon in the framework of gravity waves
over rough bottoms. As a comparison, the case of corre-
sponding regularly structured bottoms is also considered.
The results indicate that when localization occurs, the

4

wave intensity is conﬁned near the transmitting point,
and falls oﬀ exponentially. We have also demonstrated
that the localized waves stand still in the space, repre-
sented by the phase coherence behavior. In addition, the
transition from classical diﬀusion to localization is asso-
ciated with a signiﬁcant change in the transmission ﬂuc-
tuation. The observation supports the previous predic-
tions on localized waves. Since water waves are a simple
macroscopic system, experiments could be readily per-
formed. Therefore, many signiﬁcant phenomena, previ-
ously expected at microscopic scales such as the discussed
Anderson localization, may be demonstrated with water
waves.

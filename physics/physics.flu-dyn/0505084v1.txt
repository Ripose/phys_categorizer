We develop new variational principles to study stability and equilibrium of axisymmetric ﬂows.
We show that there is an inﬁnite number of steady state solutions. We compute them analytically
in some simple cases. We show that these steady states maximize a (non-universal) H-function
while conserving energy, helicity, circulation and angular momentum (robust constraints). This can
be viewed as a generalized selective decay principle. We derive relaxation equations which can be
used as numerical algorithm to construct stable stationary solutions of axisymmetric ﬂows. In a
second part, we develop a thermodynamical approach to the equilibrium states at some ﬁxed coarse-
grained scale. We show that the resulting distribution can be divided in two parts: one universal
coming from the conservation of robust invariants and one non-universal determined by the initial
conditions through the fragile invariants (for freely evolving systems) or by a prior distribution
encoding non-ideal eﬀects such as viscosity, small-scale forcing and dissipation (for forced systems).
Finally, we derive a parameterization of inviscid mixing to describe the dynamics of the system at
the coarse-grained scale. A conceptual interest of this axisymmetric model is to be intermediate
between 2D and 3D turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

The ubiquity of rotating systems in astrophysics and geophysics makes axisymmetric ﬂows a classical paradigm.
In the laboratory, two axisymmetric devices, the Taylor-Couette ﬂow and the Von Karman ﬂow, have become a
standard to investigate issues such as super-critical and sub-critical stability [1], ﬂuctuation of global quantities [2, 3]
or turbulent transport [4, 5, 6]. However, many basic issues regarding stability and turbulence in axisymmetric ﬂows
still remain unsolved. For example, one still fails to understand the onset of turbulence or the equilibrium state
in Taylor-Couette with outer rotating cylinder [7], or the recent bifurcation of the turbulent state observed in Von
K´arm´an ﬂow [8].

In the past, dynamical stability and equilibrium properties of ﬂows have often been studied using variational [9] or
maximization [10] principles. Examples of application to axisymmetric ﬂows include necessary criteria for instability or
turbulent velocity proﬁles in Taylor-Couette ﬂow. Maximization or minimization principles have also been used to give
suﬃcient criteria of nonlinear dynamical stability [11]. One interest of these methods is their robustness, in the sense
that they mostly depend on characteristic global quantities of the system (such as the energy) but not necessarily on
small-scale dissipation or boundary conditions. More recently, optimization methods have been developed within the
framework of statistical mechanics for two-dimensional (2D) perfect ﬂuids. In that case, variational principles based
on entropy maximization determine conditions of thermodynamical stability. Onsager [12] ﬁrst used a Hamiltonian
model of point vortices and identiﬁed turbulence as a state of negative temperature leading to the coalescence of
vortices of same sign [13]. Further improvement were provided by Kuzmin [14], Miller [15] and Robert and Sommeria
[16] who independently introduced a discretization of the vorticity in a certain number of levels to account for the
continuous nature of vorticity. Using the maximum entropy formalism of statistical mechanics [17], it is then possible
to obtain the shape of the metaequilibrium solution of Euler’s equation as well as the distribution of the ﬁne-grained
ﬂuctuations around it. A variety of solutions are found and the bifurcation diagram displays a rich structure as

illustrated by Chavanis & Sommeria [18]. Two-dimensional turbulence is however very peculiar since it misses vortex
stretching, one essential ingredient in 3D turbulence. The adaptation of these methods to more realistic situation is
therefore not obvious.

In the case where the system admits a scalar invariant (Dtσ = ∂tσ + u

σ = 0), one can show that a Liouville
theorem holds (incompressibility of the motion in phase space). Indeed, the proof given by Kraichnan and Montgomery
[19] in the case of 2D turbulence can be extended to any dimensional turbulence with a conserved quantity. This is in
fact the case for axisymmetric ﬂows where the symmetry imposes angular momentum conservation. The purpose of
the present paper is therefore to derive explicit results regarding nonlinear dynamical stability and thermodynamical
equilibrium properties of axisymmetric ﬂows using optimization methods.

In Sec.

In the ﬁrst part of the paper (Sec. II), we consider the nonlinear dynamical stability of stationary solutions of the
axisymmetric Euler equations (i.e. without viscosity). These equations are written in Sec. II A and the general form
of stationary solutions is obtained in Sec. II B. In Sec. II C, we list the conservation laws of the axisymmetric Euler
equations. We ﬁnd non trivial invariants in addition to the usual ones. In Sec. II D, we show that the equilibrium
solutions can be obtained by extremizing a functional built with all the invariants. The fact that this optimization
procedure returns the general stationary solution means that we have found all the invariants.
II E, we
distinguish between fragile (H-functions) and robust (energy, helicity, circulation, angular momentum...) invariants.
We argue that, in the presence of viscosity or coarse-graining, the metaequilibrium state maximizes a certain (non-
universal) H-function while conserving the robust constraints. This is similar to the case of pure 2D hydrodynamics
[20, 21, 22] except for the replacement of vorticity by angular momentum.
II F, we propose a numerical
algorithm based on the maximization of the production of a H-function while conserving the robust constraints. This
can be used to compute numerically arbitrary nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solution of the axisymmetric
Euler equations. This is similar to the relaxation equations proposed by Chavanis [20, 21] in pure 2D hydrodynamics.
In Sec. II G, we provide simple analytical steady solutions of axisymmetric equilibrium ﬂows. In the second part
of the paper (Sec.
III), we develop the statistical mechanics of such ﬂows. The statistical equilibrium state is
obtained by maximizing a mixing entropy (Sec. III A) while taking into account all the constraints of the dynamics.
This yields a Gibbs state (Sec. III B) which gives the equilibrium coarse-grained angular momentum as well as the
ﬂuctuations around it. We check that the coarse-grained ﬁeld is a stationary solution of the axisymmetric Euler
equations. However, since the Casimirs are not conserved on the coarse-grained scale, the distribution of ﬂuctuations
is non universal and depends on the initial conditions (or ﬁne-grained constraints). This is also the case for the
coarse-grained ﬁeld. In Sec. III D, we use a maximization of the entropy production to derive relaxation equations
towards the statistical equilibrium state. This is similar to the approach proposed by Robert & Sommeria [23] in pure
2D hydrodynamics. Finally, in Sec. III E, we introduce the notion of prior distribution of ﬂuctuations for systems that
are forced at small scales. We show that the coarse-grained ﬁeld maximizes at statistical equilibrium a generalized
entropy ﬁxed by the prior distribution. Thus, the relaxation equations based on the maximization of the production
of generalized entropy (Sec. II F) can also provide a parameterization of axisymmetric turbulence in the presence of
a small-scale forcing [20, 21].

The Euler equations describing the dynamics of an inviscid incompressible axisymmetric ﬂow can be written in

cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) as:

where (u, v, w) denote the components of the velocity in a cylindrical referential. Note that the third equation expresses
the conservation of the angular momentum σ = rv. Taking the curl of equations (1), one obtains an equation for the

We now introduce a variable ξ related to the azimuthal component of the vorticity by ξ = ωθ/r and deﬁne the stream

The existence of a stream function results from the incompressibility and the axisymmetry of the ﬂow. By deﬁnition,
these two functions are related through

Changing variables from (r, z) to (y, z) where y = r2/2, we may ﬁnally write the equation for the conservation of
angular momentum and Eqs. (2)-(3) as

and uy =

instead of (1). We look for stationary solutions and investigate their stability by using variational methods. Notice
that only two scalar variables are suﬃcient to prescribe such ﬂows: we use σ, related to the azimuthal component of
the velocity ﬁeld and ξ, related to the azimuthal component of the vorticity.

which leads to Eq. (14-b). Equation (14-b) is the fundamental diﬀerential equation of the problem which must be
supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions. Some particular solutions of this equation will be studied in Sec.
II G. We will ﬁrst show that the stationary solutions can be found by a variational principle depending only on the
conservation laws of the system.

Axisymmetric inviscid ﬂows satisfy a number of conservation laws. We here give the expression of these conserved

quantities and postpone corresponding proofs in Appendix A.

The ﬁrst conserved quantity is the total energy

Here, we have normalized the energy by 2π and used integration by parts to obtain the second expression.

Because of (4-a) any function of the angular momentum is also an invariant noted as

If =

f (σ) dydz .

Z

These functionals are called the Casimirs. The conservation of all the Casimirs is equivalent to the conservation
of all the moments of σ, denoted In =
σ dydz.
If σ = 0 or, more generally, σ = σ(y), then ξ is conserved via (4-b). In that case, ξ is called a potential vorticity
h(ξ) dydz. We ignore this
(or a pseudo-vorticity) and there is an additional class of Casimir invariants: Ih =

σn dydz. The ﬁrst moment is the total angular momentum I =

diﬃculty linked to a sort of “degeneracy” for the time being. Note that the situation where only the pseudo-
vorticity is conserved (i.e the case σ = 0) has been treated in [24]. In that case, the generalization essentially
amounts to replacing the Laplacian ∆ in pure 2D ﬂows by the pseudo-Laplacian ∆∗. The situation that we
consider here is complicated by the existence of additional invariants such as helicity discussed below. This
makes our situation intermediate between pure 2D turbulence and 3D turbulence, an interesting feature of our
model.

Like in any 3D ﬂows, the total helicity, H =

equations. Since we obtain the general form of steady states it means that we have found all the conservation laws of

−

In order to gain some physical insight about the problem, we consider from now on a simpler model where only the
usual helicity H and the total vorticity Γ are conserved instead of all the generalized helicities. This is similar to our
choice of restricting ourselves to the Chandrasekhar model in axisymmetric MHD [25]. We deﬁne a H-function by

S[σ] =

C(σ) dydz ,

−

Z

where C is an arbitrary convex function, i.e. C′′ > 0. This deﬁnition follows from the work of [26]. A H-function
calculated with the ﬁne-grained ﬁeld σ is exactly conserved by the axisymmetric equations (this is a particular
Casimir). Therefore, as in 2D hydrodynamics [27], the maximization of a H-function S at ﬁxed energy E, helicity
H, circulation Γ and angular momentum I determines a nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solution of the
axisymmetric Euler equations. This reﬁned stability criterion is stronger than the maximization of J = S
−
αI which just provides a suﬃcient condition of formal nonlinear dynamical stability [11]. The diﬀerence
µH
between these two criteria is similar to a notion of ensemble inequivalence in thermodynamics (where S plays the role
of an entropy and J the role of a free energy) [20, 28]. We shall not prove the nonlinear dynamical stability result in
this paper and refer to [27] for a precise discussion in 2D hydrodynamics. In Sec. II E, we show, however, that this
maximization principle is consistent with the phenomenology of axisymmetric turbulence.

where α, β, µ and γ are appropriate Lagrange multipliers. To study this variational problem governing the dynamical

is similar to an entropy and 1/β is similar to an inverse temperature. Using the expression of S, E, H, Γ and I, we
ﬁnd that the solutions of (23) valid for any δσ and δξ satisfy

(25)

which is a particular case of Eq. (11). Thus, the variational principle selects stationary solutions of the axisymmetric
Euler equations. We note that when only the ordinary helicity is considered (instead of the general helicity), we obtain
a linear relationship between σ and ψ. This is similar to the linear relationship between velocity V and magnetic ﬁeld
B in MHD [25]. Note that we have just considered the ﬁrst order variations here. To check if solutions (24) are real
maxima of the H-function (22), one has to look for second-order variations as discussed in Appendix B.

E. Generalized selective decay principle

Since a H-function calculated with the ﬁne-grained ﬁeld σ is a particular Casimir, it is rigorously conserved by the
ﬁne-grained dynamics. However, as Tremaine et al. [26] have shown for the Vlasov equation in stellar dynamics, the
H-functions calculated with the coarse-grained ﬁeld increase as mixing proceeds. This is similar to the Boltzmann
H-theorem in kinetic theory except that the Vlasov does not single out a particular functional. This property is true
also in the present context since Eq. (4-a) plays the same role as the Vlasov equation. Therefore, S[σ] is expected to
increase along the dynamics. It would also increase in the presence of a viscosity since the equations of motion now
become:

(cid:19)
and by integration by part, one can show that ˙S = ν
σ)2dr > 0. By contrast, the integrals E, Γ, H, and
C′′(σ)(
I are exactly or approximately conserved on the coarse-grained scale (i.e. when they are calculated with the coarse-
grained ﬁeld) or in the presence of a small viscosity. For example, in the presence of viscosity, the kinetic energy evolves
such that ˙E =
(σ/r eθ)
vanishes in the long time limit. The demonstration is similar to Cowling’s [29] theorem of dynamo theory which
states that an axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld cannot grow in an axisymmetric velocity ﬁeld: the ﬁrst equation in (25)
vanishes in
shows that σ
0. Thus, for axisymmetric ﬂows, both component of the vorticity vanishes
the long time limit, which implies that ξ
in the long time limit and the energy is approximately conserved.
In a similar way, it can be shown that Γ, H,
and I are approximately conserved and must therefore be strictly taken into account in the constraints. Therefore,
the H-functions can be viewed as fragile invariants while the constraints E, Γ, H, and I are robust invariants.
This generalizes the notion of selective decay in pure 2D turbulence where the enstrophy decays while the energy is
approximately conserved. In fact, minus the enstrophy is a particular H-function [20, 21, 22]. The same discussion
applies in the present context. On the basis of this phenomenological principle, we expect that, due to chaotic mixing
and violent relaxation, the system will reach a metaequilibrium state which maximizes a certain H-function (non-
universal) at ﬁxed E, Γ, H, and I. This phenomenological argument returns the variational principle (23). Since
this metaequilibrium state results from turbulent mixing, it is expected to be particularly robust and should possess
properties of nonlinear dynamical stability. Therefore, the stability arguments given previously are consistent with the
phenomenology of axisymmetric turbulence, provided that σ is interpreted as the coarse-grained angular momentum
σ. This is remarkable because the two arguments are relatively independent: there is no direct notion of decay (of
S) in the ﬁrst argument while this lies at the heart of the second. In fact, the phenomenology of violent relaxation
−
explains how an inviscid system can reach a nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary state (on a coarse-grained scale)
which is a maximum of a certain H-function at ﬁxed robust constraints. The point is that during mixing Dσ/Dt
= 0
and the H-functions S[σ] increase. Once it has mixed Dσ/Dt = 0 so that ˙S[σ] = 0. Since σ(r, t) has been brought
to a maximum σ0(r) of a certain H-function and since S[σ] is conserved (after mixing), then σ0 is a nonlinearly
dynamically stable steady state of the axisymmetric Euler equation.

F. A numerical algorithm for the dynamical stability problem

We shall construct a set of relaxation equations that increase a H-function S[σ] while conserving all the robust
constraints E, Γ, H, and I. These relaxation equations can serve as powerful numerical algorithm to compute
arbitrary stationary solutions of the axisymmetric Euler equations. In addition, they guarantee that these solutions
are nonlinearly dynamically stable via the inviscid dynamics. Such relaxation equations therefore have a clear practical
interest. They extend those obtained by Chavanis [20, 21] in 2D hydrodynamics.

where Jσ and Jξ are the currents to be determined. We have not added advective terms since we here use these
equations just as numerical algorithms, not as a description of the dynamics (see, however, Sec. III E). By construction,
these equations satisfy the conservation of the total vorticity and total angular momentum. On the other hand, the
conservation of energy and helicity impose the constraints

Note that these equations arise as critical points of the functional
F0 = E + µ0H + ν0Γ + α0I, i.e. they determine
a state of minimum energy at ﬁxed H, Γ and I. Equation (38-b) is a inhomogeneous linear equation for ψ. The
general solution is the sum of a special solution of the inhomogeneous equation superposed to the general solution of
the homogeneous equation. A special solution is easily found as

This solution corresponds either to a laminar Taylor-Couette proﬁle, or to a proﬁle maximizing turbulent transport
in Taylor-Couette ﬂow [10]. Notice that the present theory is unable to capture the 1/r dependence of the Taylor-
Couette ﬂow because the solutions have to be regular at the origin. To reproduce such a behavior, one has to consider
a domain with two frontiers (corresponding to the inner and outer cylinders), one with ψ = 0 and the other with
ψ

= 0. Such a procedure would introduce boundary terms in the conserved quantities.
A general solution of the homogeneous equation can be found by the method of separation of variables by writing
cos(κz + φ) where κ and φ are two constants. Then, one ﬁnd that

III. STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF AXISYMMETRIC FLOWS

A. The mixing entropy

Starting with a given initial condition, equations (4) are expected to develop a complicated mixing process, with
formation of ﬁner and ﬁner structure, leading to more and more degrees of freedom. A precise prediction of the state
of the system would a priori require to keep track of all these degrees of freedom. Suppose however that we are only
interested in the knowledge of the system at some coarse-grained scale. Since mixing is continuously occurring at
smaller and smaller scales, we can expect the formation of a metaequilibrium state on the coarse-grained scale. Our
goal is to derive its shape through thermodynamical arguments, based on entropy maximization in the spirit of [17].
We focus here on basics. More discussion about this procedure can be found in [16]. We introduce coarse-grained and
ﬁne-grained quantities. According to Eq. (4-c), ψ = ∆−1
∗ ξ is expressed as an integral over ξ. It is therefore a smooth
ψ. We shall determine the distribution of ﬂuctuations of angular
function whose ﬂuctuations can be neglected ψ
momentum σ by an approach similar to that developed in 2D turbulence. However, we will not be able to characterize
the ﬂuctuations of pseudo-vorticity ξ by this method; we will simply get its coarse-grained value. This diﬃculty may
reﬂect the fact that we are in a situation intermediate between 2D and 3D turbulence. It is possible that two regimes
characterize our situation. In the following, we shall treat the regime where the ﬂuctuations of ξ do not play a crucial
role so that the situation is similar to the 2D case. In Appendix D, we consider another approach which seems to
indicate that the ﬂuctuations of ξ have a peculiar behavior that may give rise to a sort of “phase transition”. Here,
for simplicity and clarity, we ﬁrst concentrate on a simpliﬁed situation where the ﬂuctuations of ξ are mild. We then
introduce ρ(r, η), the density probability of ﬁnding the value σ = η at position r. Then, the coarse-grained angular
momentum is σ =

ρdη = 1. We introduce the mixing entropy

ρηdη and the local normalization

This functional S[ρ] is equal to the logarithm of the disorder where the disorder is the number of microstates corre-
sponding to the macrostate ρ(r, η). It should not be confused with the H-function S[σ] introduced in Sec. II D. The

For the coarse-grained energy, we made the non trivial hypothesis that the ﬂuctuations of the energy could be neglected
and used the coarse-grained ﬁeld σ to calculate the mean energy. This is justiﬁed by the remark made in section II E
that in the presence of a small viscosity (or a coarse-graining), the energy is approximately conserved.

As indicated previously, E, Γ, H and I are robust constraints. Thus they can be determined at any time since their
exact value is close to their coarse-grained value. They have thus been expressed directly in terms of the coarse-grained
ﬁeld. By contrast the higher moments In>1 are fragile constraints because they are altered by coarse-graining. They
can be determined only from the initial conditions which are supposed un-mixed (or from the ﬁne-grained ﬁeld) since
ρηndydzdη.
they are aﬀected by coarse-graining in the sense that In>1[σ] =
Part of the Casimirs goes into the coarse-grained ﬁeld and part goes into ﬁne-grained ﬂuctuations. In a sense, In>1
are “hidden constraints” because they cannot be determined from the coarse-grained ﬁeld. Therefore, the statistical
theory assumes that we know the initial conditions in detail and that these initial conditions represent the ﬁne-
grained ﬁeld. This poses a conceptual problem because in real situations we are not sure whether the initial condition
is already mixed or not. Furthermore, if the initial condition already results from a mixing process (like vortices
formed in a succession of mergings in 2D decaying turbulence), it is more proper to ignore its ﬁne structure and
take its coarse-grained density as a new “ﬁne-grained” initial condition to predict the next merging (see [18], p 284).
In fact, due to viscosity, the ﬁne structure of the ﬁeld is progressively erased. These diﬃculties are intrinsic to the
statistical theory of continuous ﬁelds.

Comparing with Eq. (11), we check explicitly that the coarse-grained ﬂow is a stationary solution of the axisymmetric
Euler equations. Therefore, for given initial conditions, the statistical theory selects a particular stationary solution
among all possible ones. We remark that the diﬀerential equation for ψ, arising from Eq. (60) and (4)-c involves the
inverse F −1 of the function determined by Eq. (57-a) while in pure 2D turbulence it involves the direct function F ,
i.e.

∆ψ = F (βψ + α). This “inversion” is another striking particularity of our system.

Comparing Eq. (60) with Eq. (24), we note that the equilibrium coarse-grained angular velocity maximizes a

−

certain H-function where C is related to F by F −1(σ) =

C′(σ) or

The H-function predicted by the statistical theory can be called a “generalized entropy” in σ-space [20, 21, 22]. It
depends on the initial conditions through the function χ(η) which must be related to the ﬁne-grained moments of
angular momentum (Casimirs). Therefore, in this approach where the constraints associated with the Casimirs are
treated microcanonically, the generalized entropy in σ-space can only be obtained a posteriori, after having solved
the full equilibrium equations and related the Lagrange multipliers to the constraints. On the other hand, using
σ2 =

C′(σ) according to (24)-b, we get the identity

d σ/dΨ according to (57)-b and Ψ =

−

Therefore, at equilibrium, there is a functional relation between the variance σ2 of the distribution and the coarse-
grained angular momentum σ through the second derivative of the function C. This is similar to the “ﬂuctuation-
dissipation” theorem [31].

details. In the two-levels case where η = λ0, λ1, we get

In the present case, we need to invert this relation to express ξ as a function of σ, hence ψ. As discussed above, this
situation is reversed with respect to pure 2D plane ﬂows. We thus obtain

D. Relaxation towards the statistical equilibrium state

We would like now to construct a system of relaxation equations which conserves all the invariants of the inviscid
dynamics (robust and fragile) and relaxes towards the statistical equilibrium state. These equations can be used as a
numerical algorithm to construct the statistical equilibrium state. They also provide a subgrid scale parameterization
of axisymmetric turbulence. In that context, they can describe the dynamical evolution of the ﬂow on the coarse-
grained scale. Note that in the coarse-grained formulation, the inviscid approximation is easier to justify, since
viscosity only acts at very small scales. Following the approach of Robert & Sommeria [23], these relaxation equations
can be obtained by using a Maximum Entropy Production Principle.

The equations of evolution for the coarse-grained ﬁelds are given by

where Jσ and Jξ are currents which contain all the information coming from interaction with sub-grid scales. Note
that we have kept the advective terms because these equations are expected to describe the relaxation of the ﬂow (on
the coarse-grained scale) towards statistical equilibrium; they are not only numerical algorithms. If we want to keep
track of the conservation of all the Casimirs (or equivalently of the total area of each level of angular momentum),
we need to introduce equations of conservation for the density probability ρ(r, η, t) of angular momentum. We write
them as

where J(r, η, t) is the current of the level η of angular momentum. Multiplying Eq. (78) by η and integrating over
J η dη. Furthermore, the conservation of the local normalization
all the levels, we recover Eq. (77-a) with Jσ =

The time variations of S[ρ] are given by

We are now led to a complicated closure problem because each equation of the hierarchy involves the next order
moments. For example, the equation for σ involves σ2 etc.
−
σ). On the other hand, a Gaussian distribution of ﬂuctuations at equilibrium can be obtained by imposing
λ0)(λ1 −
that σ2 is constant.
In these two particular cases, the equations (96) are closed. More generally, we must write
down the higher moments of the hierarchy and close them with a local maximum entropy principle as proposed by
Robert & Rosier [32]. If we implement this procedure up to second moment, it leads to a Gaussian distribution. Its
implementation to higher moments is diﬃcult. Furthermore, its physical justiﬁcation is unclear. In practice, we must
come back to the N coupled PDE for the levels.

In the two levels approximation, one has σ2 = (σ

E. Prior distribution and generalized entropy

In the statistical approach presented previously, we have assumed that the system is rigorously described by the
axisymmetric Euler equations so that the conservation of all the Casimirs In must be taken into account. This
corresponds to a freely evolving situation. Alternatively, in the case of ﬂows that are forced at small-scales, Ellis
et al. [27] have proposed to replace the conservation of all the Casimirs by the speciﬁcation of a prior distribution
χ(η) encoding the small-scale forcing. This approach has been further developed in Chavanis [21]. In this approach,
the constraints associated with the (fragile) moments In>1 are treated canonically instead of microcanonically. By
contrast, the robust constraints (energy, circulation, helicity, angular momentum) are still treated microcanonically.
If we view the levels η of angular momentum as diﬀerent species of particles, this approach amounts to ﬁxing the
chemical potentials instead of the total number of particles in each species. The idea is that the ambient medium
behaves as a reservoir of angular momentum: the small-scale forcing and dissipation aﬀect the conservation of the
moments of angular momentum In>1 while ﬁxing instead the canonical variables αn.

Therefore, in the present situation, the relevant entropy Sχ is obtained from the mixing entropy (45) by making a
Legendre transform on the fragile moments In>1 [21]. If we assume that the αn in the variational principle (49) are
ﬁxed by the “reservoir” (ambient medium), we can deﬁne a relative entropy by

Sχ = S

This is similar to the passage from the entropy S (microcanonical description) to the grand potential Ω = S

(grand microcanonical description) in usual thermodynamics when the chemical potential is ﬁxed instead of the
particle number. Using Eq. (45), we get

The function χ(η) is interpreted as a prior distribution of angular momentum. It is a global distribution of angular
momentum ﬁxed by the small-scale forcing. It must be regarded as given. In this approach, the statistical equilibrium
state is obtained by maximizing the relative entropy (100) while conserving only the robust constraints. Thus, we
write the variational problem as

We can now repeat the calculations of Sec. III B with almost no modiﬁcation. The only diﬀerence is that we regard
the αn’s as given. Therefore, the Gibbs state is determined by Eq. (51) where χ(η) is ﬁxed a priori by the small-scale
forcing. Recall that in the previous approach (freely evolving ﬂows), it had to be determined a posteriori from the initial
conditions (assumed known) by a complicated procedure. Here, the speciﬁcation of χ(η) automatically determines
C(σ) dr is
the function F by Eq. (57) and then C by Eq. (61). Thus, the generalized entropy in σ-space S[σ] =
now determined by the small-scale forcing through the prior χ(η) while in the preceding approach it was determined
by the initial conditions through the Casimirs In>1. Explicitly, the generalized entropy is expressed as a function of
χ by the formula [22]:

The equilibrium coarse-grained angular momentum σ maximizes the generalized entropy (22)-(102) at ﬁxed robust
constraints E, Γ, H and I. In the present context, the relaxation equations introduced in Sec. II F can describe
the relaxation of the coarse-grained ﬂow towards statistical equilibrium once the small-scale forcing has established
a permanent regime characterized by a prior distribution χ(η) determining a generalized entropy S[σ]. Since we are
now interested by the route to equilibrium we need to restore the advective terms, so we write:

The physical interpretation of these equations is quite diﬀerent from (33). In Sec. II F, the relaxation equations (33)
provide a numerical algorithm to determine any nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solution of the axisymmetric
matters and
+
equations, speciﬁed by the convex function C. In this context, only the stationary solution for t
∞
the evolution towards that state has no physical meaning (it is just the engine of the algorithm).
In the present
section, the relaxation equations (103) provide a description of the evolution of the coarse-grained ﬁeld, for all time
t, in a medium where a small-scale forcing imposes a prior distribution χ(η) (or a generalized entropy C(σ)). These
equations conserve only the robust constraints and satisfy a generalized maximum entropy production principle for
the functional S[σ]. Finally, the relaxation equations of Sec.
III D provide a description of the evolution of the
coarse-grained ﬁeld, for all time t, of a freely evolving system. These equations conserve all the constraints (including
the Casimirs) and satisfy a maximum entropy production principle for the functional S[ρ]. Note that the relaxation
equations (103) can also be obtained from the moments equations (96)-(97) of the ordinary statistical theory by using
the relation (62) to express σ2 as a function of σ. In a sense, this relation can be seen as a closure relation imposed
by a small-scale forcing. Thus, the relaxation equations (103) are not simply numerical algorithms; they can also
provide a parameterization of axisymmetric ﬂows with a small-scale forcing. Their interest as numerical algorithms
(in the sense of Sec. II F) remains however important in case of incomplete relaxation to construct stable stationary
solutions of the Euler equation which are not consistent with the statistical theory (in cases where the evolution is
non-ergodic) in order to reproduce the observations, as discussed in [20, 21, 22].

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have developed new variational principles to study stability and equilibrium of axisymmetric
ﬂows. We have completely characterized the steady states of the inviscid case and found that there is an inﬁnite
number of solutions. We have computed them analytically in some simple cases. We have found the Lyapunov
functional associated with these steady states. In a second part, we have developed a thermodynamical approach to
the equilibrium states at some ﬁxed coarse-grained scale. We found that the resulting distribution can be divided in
two parts: one universal part, coming from the robust constraints, and one non-universal, which depends on the initial
conditions (Casimirs) for freely evolving systems or on a prior distribution encoding non-ideal eﬀects such as forcing

and dissipation. Finally, we have derived relaxation equations which can be used either as algorithm to compute
stable stationary solutions of the axisymmetric Euler equations, or to describe the dynamics of the system (freely
evolving or forced) at the coarse-grained level. In a second paper, we confront our prediction to experimental data,
and use them to derive and characterize the non-universal features of the equilibrium distributions.

APPENDIX B: STABILITY OF SOLUTIONS

of the following set of equations :

However, only maxima of the H-function are nonlinearly dynamically stable. We need therefore to investigate the
sign of the second order variations of the free energy J = S
αI. Writing σ = σ0 + δσ, ξ = ξ0 + δξ
and ψ = ψ0 + δψ, one obtains for all δσ and δξ:

Putting δσ = 0 in equation (B2), the condition δ2J[σ0, ξ0] < 0 thus implies that β must be positive. This is at variance
with pure 2D hydrodynamics, where stable structures can exist at negative temperature and are the most relevant.
Also, assuming δξ = 0, one ﬁnds that a maximum of free energy should satisfy the following condition:

order for δ2J[σ0, ξ0] to be negative but a suﬃcient condition can be found by using the fact that in (B2), the last
term in the integral is everywhere positive. Consequently, a suﬃcient condition for δ2J < 0 is:

APPENDIX D: FLUCTUATIONS OF ξ

1. Generalities

In this Appendix, we try to develop the statistical mechanics approach in the general case, without ignoring the
ﬂuctuations of ξ. Since ξ is not conserved by the axisymmetric equations (Dξ/Dt
= 0), this may invalidate the use of
a statistical theory to predict its ﬂuctuations, so that our approach is essentially phenomenological and explanatory.
We introduce ρ(r, η, ν), the density probability of ﬁnding the values σ = η and ξ = ν in r at equilibrium. Then, the
coarse-grained ﬁelds are σ =
ρ dηdν = 1. We introduce the
mixing entropy

ρν dηdν and the local normalization is

ρη dηdν, ξ =

The coarse-grained ﬁelds ¯σ and ¯ξ are the averaged values of the distribution (D6). This approach predicts that the
eΛ(y,z,η)ν so that, depending on the sign of Λ, it
distribution of ﬂuctuations of pseudo-vorticity is exponential
diverges either for ν
. The problem of the smoothness of the vorticity is still an unresolved issue
or ν
for the Navier-Stokes equation related to the existence and uniqueness of its solutions. In two dimensions, it can be
shown that it is bounded [33] whereas in three dimensions, very little is known. In our case, which is intermediate
between these two cases, we can infer that the vorticity will be bounded as we have seen that in the axisymmetric
case, the vorticity has to vanish in the long time limit (see section II E). The range of integration for the variable ν
is thus restricted to ﬁnite values:

Due to the eΛν dependence of the density probability, one can check that the extremal states of the Gibbs probability
distribution are saddle points (stable in one direction, unstable in the other), except when F is constant and βψ+µF =
0 (leading to ¯ξ = 0), in which case they are stable states for positive temperature β > 0. The ﬁelds
thus
are not real extrema of the distribution. Moreover, one sees that when F is constant with βψ + µF = 0 and G is

linear, the probability distribution of η is a Gaussian in the variable (η

coincides with the mean state ¯σ. However, this is not the generic

We now look at possible extrema on the frontier of the domain of integration, for ν =

vorticity). Since the dissipation of kinetic energy is equal to the space integral of the squared vorticity (see Sec.
II E), our conclusion ressembles the assumption made by Malkus [34], followed by Howard [35] and Busse [36], who
calculated bounds on the kinetic energy dissipation for thermal convection problems by maximizing the dissipation
on a manifold that includes the solutions of the problem. This principle of maximal dissipation has been extended
to a purely chaotic system by [37] and in this case too, the observed equilibrium solutions are very close to that
calculated by a maximization of the dissipation. It is however interesting to notice that in these approaches, the
maximum dissipation is assumed and the shape of the equilibrium ﬁeld is derived while in our approach we show that
the equilibrium state (which maximizes the entropy) is the one with a maximal vorticity ﬁeld. The drawback of our
approach, however, is that we do not have an explicit form for the equilibrium solution, unless we know how to derive
the bound on the vorticity.

F

A few examples can be given to illustrate the points developed above. For simplicity, let us consider ﬁrst the case

with F = 1, where η and ν become independent. In such case, the probability distribution function is :

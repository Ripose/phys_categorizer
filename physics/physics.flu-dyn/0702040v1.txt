Abstract

We introduce a dynamical description based on a probability density φ(σ, x, y, t)
of the vorticity σ in two-dimensional viscous ﬂows such that the average vor-
ticity evolves according to the Navier-Stokes equations. A time-dependent
mixing index is deﬁned and the class of probability densities that maximizes
this index is studied. The time dependence of the Lagrange multipliers can
be chosen in such a way that the masses m(σ, t) :=
dxdy φ(σ, x, y, t) asso-
ciated with each vorticity value σ are conserved. When the masses m(σ, t)
are conserved then 1) the mixing index satisﬁes an H-theorem and 2) the
mixing index is the time-dependent analogue of the entropy employed in
the statistical mechanical theory of inviscid 2D ﬂows [Miller, Weichman &
Cross, Phys. Rev. A 45 (1992); Robert & Sommeria, Phys. Rev. Lett.
69, 2776 (1992)]. Within this framework we also show how to reconstruct
the probability density of the quasi-stationary coherent structures from the
experimentally determined vorticity-stream function relations and we pro-
vide a connection between this probability density and an appropriate initial
distribution.

Introduction

When studying the dynamics of two-dimensional ﬂuid motion characterized
by a vorticity ﬁeld ω(x, y, t) it can be useful to turn to a statistical descrip-
tion with probability distributions φ(σ, x, y, t) for the microscopic vorticity σ
such the average value of σ over these distributions is equal to ω(x, y, t). In
particular, this has been done in the description of the quasi-stationary states
(QSS), i.e., the coherent structures which are often reached in (numerical)
experiments after a fast mixing process has taken place[29, 11, 18, 14, 25]. At
high Reynolds’ numbers, the vorticity ﬁelds ωS(x, y) of these QSS’s satisfy
Ω(ψ(x, y)) where

ψ(x, y) is the corresponding stream-function. In other words, the QSS’s are
approximate stationary solutions of the Euler equation.

More speciﬁcally, in the early 1990’s Miller[16] and Robert[21, 22] together
with their coworkers[17, 24, 23]presented a statistical mechanical theory of
steady ﬂows in inviscid, two-dimensional ﬂuids, an approach that can be
traced back to Linden-Bell’s work of 1967 [13]. Some outstanding aspects of
this non-dissipative system are: 1) an inﬁnite number of conserved quantities,
the masses associated with each microscopic-vorticity value σ, 2) non-uniform
steady states or coherent structures, 3) negative-temperature states (already
predicted by Onsager’s work on point vortices [19] ). Theoretical predictions
were compared with numerical simulations and with experimental measure-
ments in quasi-two dimensional ﬂuids, e.g., in [15, 14, 3, 25, 4]. However,
under standard laboratory conditions ﬂuids are viscous. Similarly, numeri-
cal simulations require the introduction of a non-vanishing (hyper)viscosity
in order to avoid some numerical instabilities and other artifacts. A non-
vanishing viscosity can lead to noticeable eﬀects, like the breakdown of the
conservation laws, even at high Reynolds’ numbers, i.e., when the viscosity
“is small”. This is true especially when studying long-time processes like the
generation of the coherent structures. In spite of the dissipative nature of
the ﬂows studied, in many cases, it was found that the agreement between
the theoretical predictions based on the Miller, Robert and Sommeria (MRS)
inviscid theory and (numerical) experiments was better than expected.

The main purpose of the present paper is to better understand these is-
sues in a more dynamical setting. We start by reviewing the MRS theory
In Section 3 we consider viscous ﬂows and propose a fam-
in Section 2.
ily of model evolution equations for the vorticity distribution φ(σ, x, y, t). In
Sections 4–6 we discuss a class of time-dependent distributions that maxi-
mize a mixing index under certain constraints. In particular, in Section 5
it is shown that the time-dependent Lagrange multipliers appearing in these
distributions can be chosen in such a way that the masses associated with
each microscopic-vorticity value σ are conserved. When these masses are
conserved, the mixing index is the time-dependent analogue of the entropy
functional used by MRS and it satisﬁes an H-theorem, as it is shown in Ap-
φS(σ, ψ(x, y)) associated with a given QSS can be
pendix A. The distribution
obtained, at least in principle, by addressing the reconstruction problem, i.e.,
the question of how to extract its deﬁning parameters from the QSS’s ω
ψ
relation. This is discussed in Section 7. In doing so we provide a natural
framework for a time-dependent statistical theory connecting an appropriate
initial distribution to the QSS distribution associated with the experimental
ω
ψ relation and evolving in agreement with the Navier-Stokes equation.
The relation of the present work with the MRS theory and with the yard-

2.1 Review

The pillars on which the statistical mechanical approach[17, 24] stands are the
conserved quantities of the non-dissipative Euler equations. These quantities
are: 1) the total energy Eo := 2−1
o where −→v o(x, y) is the initial
velocity ﬁeld and A is the area occupied by the ﬂuid and 2) the area density,
denoted by g(σ) dσ, occupied by ﬂuid with vorticity values between σ and
σ + dσ, which is

dσ φ(σ, x, y) = 1, for all (x, y).

For the sake of simplicity, we will ignore other conserved quantities which
may be present due to some symmetries of the domain A, like the linear
momentum and/or the angular momentum. Averages taken over this distri-
bution will be indicated by

2.2 The initial state

As we have seen, in its standard formulation, the MRS theory introduces an
asymmetry in the microscopic characterization of the initial state and that
of the ﬁnal quasi-stationary state. Namely, it is assumed that the initial
state is an “unmixed state” for which the microscopic and macroscopic de-
scription coincide. This allows to determine go(σ) the microscopic vorticity
distribution of the initial state from the macroscopic vorticity ﬁeld ωo(x, y),
confer eq. (3). By contrast, the microscopic vorticity-area density of the most
probable state, gS(σ), is given by
dx dy φS(σ, x, y), confer eq. (6). In most
cases, GS(σ), the macroscopic vorticity density of the most probable state,

GS(σ) :=

dx dy δ(σ

ωS(x, y)),

(10)

−

is diﬀerent from the microscopic vorticity-area density of the most probable
state, i.e., GS(σ)
= gS(σ). For example, for non-vanishing viscosity the even
moments of GS(σ) denoted by Γ2n, i.e.,

R

ZA

Γ2n :=

dx dy ω2n

S (x, y),

ZA

are smaller than those of gS(σ) since in the MRS approach one assumes that
gS(σ) = go(σ), confer (25) below. This diﬀerence between the moments of
the macroscopic and those of the microscopic vorticity has led to confusion
and to discussions in the literature related to the interpretation of the MRS
theory[12, 5].
According to the MRS theory the microscopic-vorticity moments Mn of the
QSS, confer Equation (9), equal the microscopic-vorticity moments of the
δ-type initial distribution deﬁned in (3). In Subsection III B of an earlier

5

paper[6] we have expressed this inﬁnite set of equalities in terms of the ω
ψ
relation and the initial macroscopic vorticity ﬁeld ωo(x, y). In order to assess
the validity of the MRS approach, we introduced then a yardstick associated
with each moment Mn, see further the discussion in Section 9.

3 Microscopic Viscous Models

From here onwards we deal with time dependent probability densities, i.e.,
φ(σ, x, y, t)dσ is the probability of ﬁnding at time t a microscopic vorticity
value in the range (σ, σ + dσ) at a position (x, y) which is non-negative and
normalized

The macroscopic vorticity ﬁeld is

where the notation introduced in (2) has been extended to the time-dependent
case. In the inviscid case, the time evolution of φ(σ, x, y, t) can be taken to
be

∂t

+ ~v(x, y, t)

φ(σ, x, y, t) = 0,

(13)

where the macroscopic, incompressible velocity ﬁeld ~v(x, y, t) satisﬁes ap-
propriate boundary conditions and is related to the macroscopic vorticity
ω(x, y, t) by

~v = ω

z a unit vector perpendicular to the (x, y)-plane. Consequently, the
with
advective term in equation (13) is quadratic in φ and diﬀerent values of σ
are coupled by this term.

e

In this Section we introduce some model evolution equations for the prob-
ability density φ(σ, x, y, t). We demand that these microscopic models be
compatible with the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equations. The general form
of these models is

∂φ(σ, x, y, t)
∂t

+ ~v(x, y, t)

φ(σ, x, y, t) = νO(σ, x, y, t),

conservation of the total probabilty

and by 2) the macroscopic Navier-Stokes equation should follow from the
microscopic model, therefore,

dσ σO = ∆ω(x, y, t),

(17)

Z

so that, multiplying both sides of equation (15) by σ, integrating them over
σ and making use of (12) and (17), one gets the Navier-Stokes equation

∂ω(x, y, t)
∂t

· ∇

+ ~v(x, y, t)

ω(x, y, t) = ν∆ω(x, y, t).

(18)

For future convenience, let us introduce

O =: ∆φ(σ, x, y, t) + Oφ,

with

O

= 0,

and

σO
(cid:10)

(cid:11)

= 0,

(19a)

so that the constraints (16) and (17) are satisﬁed.

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

It is convenient to introduce the “masses” m(σ, t) associated with each

value σ of the microscopic vorticity,

m(σ, t) :=

dx dy φ(σ, x, y, t).

(20)

Z

In the inviscid case, incompressibility and the fact that the vorticity is just
advected by the velocity ﬁeld, allow for a complete association between a
vorticity value σ and the area that is occupied by such value. In this case
one talks of ‘conservation of the area occupied by a vorticity value’.
In
fact, in the inviscid case, ν = 0, equation (15) has a solution φ(σ, x, y, t) =
ω(x, y, t)) so that the above-deﬁned m(σ, t) is indeed the area occupied
δ(σ
by the vorticity ﬁeld with value σ. As soon as we introduce a diﬀusion process,
as it is implied by equation (15) with ν
= 0, such an identiﬁcation becomes
It is for this reason that we call m(σ, t) a
problematic if not impossible.
“mass” and, by doing so, we stress the obvious analogy with an advection-
diﬀusion process of an inﬁnite number of “chemical species”, one species for
each value σ.

In order to derive these time-evolution equations (21) it was assumed that
there is no leakage of φ(σ, x, y, t) through the boundary, i.e., that the total
ﬂux of φ(σ, x, y, t) through the boundary vanishes,

where the path of the integral is taken over the boundary and ~n is the normal
unit vector. These conditions, as well as other boundary conditions that will
be used in the sequel, are satisﬁed, e.g., in the case of periodic boundary
conditions as well as by probability ﬁelds whose support stays away from the
boundary at all times. In the case of impenetrable boundary conditions one
has that, on the boundary, ~n

0, so that the last condition reduces to

~v

ds ~n

φ(σ, x, y, t) = 0.

(22)

On a macroscopic level this implies, e.g., that

and the conservation of the total circulation

The simplest model satisfying the above requirements is the one with

0, i.e.,

≡

+ ~v(x, y, t)

φ(σ, x, y, t) = ν∆φ(σ, x, y, t),

(23)

with the incompressible velocity ﬁeld related to the vorticity as in eq. (14).
In spite of its simplicity, this model is very instructive because, while it
dissipates energy, it has an inﬁnite number of conserved quantities. Indeed,
the masses are conserved,

∂m(σ, t)
∂t

= 0,

(24)

confer (21).

One of the consequences of the conservation laws (24) is that all the
dσ σnm(σ, t) are constants of the

microscopic-vorticity moments Mn(t) :=
motion, i.e.,

In the sequel we shall assume that the conservation of all the microscopic
moments Mn implies in turn that the masses m(σ, t) are conserved. This is
the case if certain technical conditions are satisﬁed, see e.g., [26].

In conclusion: The viscous Navier-Stokes equation (18) does not exclude
the possibility of an inﬁnite number of conserved quantities m(σ, t) as deﬁned
in equation (20).

In the following Sections we will consider more generic models with O

= 0

that conserve the masses m(σ, t).

4 Chaotic mixing

Considering once more the models deﬁned by equations (23) and (15), we
notice that they are advection-diﬀusion equations for a non-passive scalar
φ with the viscosity ν playing the role of a diﬀusion coeﬃcient. This type
of equations has been studied extensively, see e.g.
[20] and the references
therein. It is well-known that a time-dependent velocity ﬁeld ~v(x, y, t) usually
leads to chaotic trajectories, i.e., to the explosive growth of small-scale φ-
gradients. These small-scale gradients are then rapidly smoothed out by
diﬀusion, the net result being a very large eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient, large
in comparison to the molecular coeﬃcient ν.

Based on these observations we will consider situations such that dur-
ing a period of time, starting at t0 and ending at TS when a quasi-stationary
structure (QSS) is formed, a fast mixing process takes place leading to a prob-
ability density, denoted by φS (σ, x, y) , that maximizes the spatial spreading
or mixing of the masses m(σ, TS) and is such that ωS(x, y) =
dσ σφS(σ, x, y)
satisﬁes the experimentally found ω
ψ relation. More speciﬁcally, we will
−
investigate solutions of equation (15) for suitable νO on the right-hand side
satisfying the following conditions: i) at time t = TS the solution φ(σ, x, y, t)
is the above-mentioned maximally mixed φS(σ, x, y) complying with the ex-
ψ relation and ii) the mixing takes place much faster than
perimental ω
the changes in the masses m(σ, t), so that m(σ, TS) ∼= m(σ, t0). In order to
express these ideas in a quantitative form, we need a mathematical deﬁni-
tion of the degree of spreading or mixing of a solute’s mass in a domain. As
described in Appendix A, the 0–order degree of mixing s0(σ, t) deﬁned as

−

R

s0(σ, t) :=

dx dy φ(σ, x, y, t) ln [Aφ(σ, x, y, t)/m(σ, t)] ,

(26)

−

Z

is the right quantity in order to quantify the mixing of the microscopic-
vorticity masses m(σ, t). Accordingly, the total vorticity mixing at time t, is
measured by

S0(t) :=

dσ s0(σ, t).

Z

More explicitly,

S0(t) =

(cid:2)
The ﬁrst term coincides with the MRS entropy (4). If the masses are con-
served, i.e., if m(σ, t) = m (σ, t0) , then the second term is constant in time.
This allows us to give a mathematical deﬁnition of fast mixing, namely: fast

It turns out that, for our purposes, a second constraint is needed. Here
we discuss two possible choices of this second constraint. One possible choice
of the second constraint consists in using the macroscopic vorticity ω(x, y, t),
i.e., the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation with initial condition ωo(x, y)
as input. This means that one demands,

dσ σφ(σ, x, y, t) = ω(x, y, t).

Z

Two points should be stressed: 1) since ω(x, y, t) is a solution of the Navier-
Stokes equation (18) this choice of the second constraint is totally compatible
with the presence of viscous dissipation and 2) this choice of the second
constraint can be imposed at all times t, not only at time TS when the QSS
is present. The probability distributions which are obtained by maximizing
the total degree of mixing S0(t) under the constraints of given values m(σ, t)
for the masses (20) and given the vorticity ﬁeld ω(x, y, t), are presented in
the next Section.

The second possible choice of the constraint stems from physical evidence
that, in high Reynolds’ number, two-dimensional ﬂows, the energy is trans-
ported from the small to the large scales and, consequently, it is weakly
aﬀected by viscous dissipation. More formally,

Therefore, one maximazes S0 under the constraints that the masses and the

energy at time TS have some given values m(σ, TS) and E(TS). Introducing
µ(σ), as well as a Lagrange
the corresponding Lagrange multipliers β and

at the probability density (5) of the inviscid, statistical mechanics approach.
The new elements here are the conditions expressed by (28) and (29), i.e.,
a criterium for the applicability of these equations in the case of viscous
ﬂows. Notice, moreover, that in contraposition to the statistical mechanical
approach, we do not require that the energy E(TS) and the masses m(σ, TS)
at time TS be equal to their initial values; equations (28) and (29) only ex-

In closing this Section, it is worthwhile recalling that under the physical
conditions leading to the inequality in (29) the changes in energy are usually
much smaller than the changes in enstrophy. This fact is at the basis of the
so-called selective-decay hypothesis[15], i.e., the conjecture that the QSSs
correspond to macroscopic vorticity ﬁelds with energy E(TS) which minimize
the macroscopic enstrophy Γ2(TS). See also [4].

5 The time-dependent extremal distributions

In this Section we investigate the time-dependent probability distributions
which are obtained by using the macroscopic vorticity ω(x, y, t) as second
constraint. As it will be shown in the following Subsection, the form of these
distributions is,

φ∗(σ, x, y, t) = Z −1 exp [µ(σ, t) + χ(x, y, t)σ] ,

with

Z :=

dσ exp [σχ(x, y, t) + µ(σ, t)] .

The functions χ(x, y, t) and µ(σ, t) will be called the “potentials”. In contrast
to the situation in the statistical mechanics approach, these potentials can
be time-dependent. Evidently, for these distributions one has φ∗(σ, x, y, t) =:
dependence of ω(x, y, t) as well as that

5.1 Maximum mixing

Time-dependent distributions as in Equation (31) are obtained by maximiz-
ing S0(t), the total degree of mixing at time t, under the constraints of i)
normalization, confer Equation (11), ii) given values m(σ, t) for the masses
at time t as deﬁned in (20) and iii) given vorticity ﬁeld ω(x, y, t) at time t,
= ω(x, y, t). Indeed, introduc-
i.e., the distribution’s ﬁrst moment (12),
ing the corresponding time-dependent Lagrange multipliers γ(x, y, t),
µ(σ, t)
and χ(x, y, t) and denoting the extremal distribution by φM (σ, x, y, t), one
has that the vanishing of the ﬁrst-order variation reads

0 = γ(x, y, t) + χ(x, y, t)σ +

from which, in analogy with the derivation of the statistical mechanical for-
mulas in Section 4, one obtains that φM (σ, x, y, t) has precisely the form
i.e., φM (σ, x, y, t) = φ∗(σ, x, y, t) with µ(σ, t) :=
of φ∗(σ, x, y, t) in (31),
µ(σ, t) + ln A−1m(σ, t). The potential functions χ(x, y, t) and µ(σ, t) should

be determined from the two following constraints

e

ω(x, y, t) = Z −1

dσ σ exp [σχ(x, y, t) + µ(σ, t)] ,

(35)

and m(σ, t) =

dx dy Z −1 exp [σχ(x, y, t) + µ(σ, t)] ,

where the vorticity ﬁeld ω(x, y, t) is not a stationary solution of the Eu-
ler equations but a time-dependent solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.

Z

The main diﬀerences with the maximizer φS(σ, x, y) of the previous Section
are that these distributions φM (σ, x, y, t) are time-dependent and that now
there is no energy constraint, therefore, the Lagrange multiplier χ(x, y, t) is
not a linear function of the stream-function ψ(x, y, t). Up till now, the time
dependence of µ(σ, t) has been arbitrary, in the next Subsection this time
dependence will be determined such that the masses m(σ, t) are conserved.

5.2 The time-dependence of µ(σ, t) and the conserva-

tion of the total moments

Assume that at all times the probability density has the form given in (31)
which is a time dependent probability density such that S0(t) attains its
= ω(x, y, t) and given m(σ, t). Inserting
maximum value compatible with
these expressions in the Navier-Stokes equation (18) and making use of simple
algebraic equalities like,

From this inﬁnite set of equations, linear in dµ2/dt, dµ3/dt, ...., the dµk/dt can
be solved, in principle. We have then a viscous model with an inﬁnite number
of conservation laws. Such a viscous model becomes physically more relevant
φS(σ, ψ(x, y)) as
by making it compatible with a quasi-stationary distribution
given by Equation (5) with associated Ω(ψ) relation at time TS, i.e., at time
TS we can associate with
φS(σ, ψ(x, y)) a distribution function as in Equation
(31) which is a solution of the time-evolution Equations (15) and (38), with
suitable initial conditions such that φ∗(σ, x, y, TS) =

φ(σ, χ(x, y, TS), TS) =

In concluding we want to remark that, as it is shown in Appendix A,
an H-theorem holds for the extremal distributions φ∗(σ, x, y, t) in the case of
conserved masses m(σ, t) treated in this paper. More precisely, it is for these

distributions with conserved masses that one can prove that dS0(t)/dt
Such an H-theorem does not hold for the other measures of mixing Sr with

In this paper we are mainly concerned with dynamical models such that

inequalities in (28) will always be satisﬁed2 and assuming that the probability
distribution φ is of the extremal form given in Equation (31), we can make use
of equation (67) in order to write inequality (29) of the fast mixing condition

Although the energy-related fast-mixing condition (29) does not play a
role in obtaining the time-dependent distributions φM (σ, x, y, t) = φ∗(σ, x, y, t),
it is still an interesting issue to determine to which extent this fast-mixing
condition is actually satisﬁed or not by the φ∗(σ, x, y, t) distributions or more
general φ(σ, x, y, t) satisfying equations (15)-(17). In fact, for high Reynolds’
number one expects that after a time-interval of fast mixing one arrives at
a well-mixed probability distribution with E(TS) . E(to). In order to in-

7 Reconstructing µ(σ) from experimental data

Suppose that in an experiment one is given an initial vorticity ﬁeld with
its corresponding energy Eo and that one ﬁnds, from a time TS onwards, a

Eo. As we show below this
with a monotonic Ω(ψ) and an energy ES ≤
experimental data can be used in order to determine the µ(σ) potential
φS(σ, ψ). Once the distribu-
occuring in the quasi-stationary distribution
φS(σ, ψ) has been reconstructed from the experimental data we can
tion
then associate with it a time-dependent distribution function φ∗(σ, x, y, t)
as given by equation (31) which is a solution of the time-evolution Equa-
tion (15) with suitable initial conditions and such that at time t = TS one
has φ∗(σ, x, y, TS) =
βψ
and with µ(σ, TS) = µ(σ). Here β can be deﬁned such that M2(TS), the
second microscopic-vorticity moment of the QSS at time TS, is equal to the
enstrophy Γ0
2 of the initial vorticity ﬁeld ω(x, y, to). More explicitly, the con-
dition M2(TS) = M2(t0) = Γ0

The time-dependence of µ(σ, t) is chosen as in Subsection 55.2, i.e., such

that all masses m(σ, t) are constant in time.

In order to determine the µ(σ) potential from the experimental Ω(ψ), we

notice that any monotonic function, like

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this correlation will be negative,

models with conserved second and fourth moments, a slightly non-Gaussian
initial distribution will evolve into a more strongly non-Gaussian distribution.

in fact, at high Reynolds’ numbers it is only the energy that is
approximately conserved[15]. On the other hand, as we have seen, the con-
servation of the microscopic-vorticity masses m(σ, t) is compatible with a
non-vanishing viscosity, it leads to spatial mixing of the masses without de-
stroying or creating them. This is the picture adopted in the present paper.
By working with the family of maximally mixed states studied in Sec-
tions 4-6 we reached a mathematical formulation that, as far as the QSS is
concerned, shows many parallels with the MRS formulation. In Section 7 we
addressed the problem of how to determine the QSS distribution φS(σ, x, y)
from an experimental ω
ψ relation and β given by Equation (46). Identi-
fying this φS(σ, x, y) with the distribution φ(σ, x, y, TS) = φM (σ, x, y, TS) =
φLB(σ, x, y, TS) = φ∗(σ, x, y, TS) of Section 5 and using a time-dependent
µ(σ, t) satisfying Equations (41)-(42) and such that µ(σ, TS) = µ(σ) we have
a dynamical model that conserves the masses, i.e. with m(σ, t) = m(σ, to),
and connects the experimental ω
ψ relation found at time TS with an initial
condition φ(σ, x, y, to). An extra bonus that follows from this methodology
is that an H-theorem holds, moreover, it holds for one measure of spatial
mixing, namely for the S0 degree of mixing, confer Appendix A. When the

as yardsticks in order to investigate the validity of the statistical mechanical
approach according to which all these quantities should equal 1. Choosing β
Γ0
as in (46) the yardstick relation δ2/
= 1 is automatically satisﬁed
while the remaining yardsticks for n > 2 are nontrivial checks for the valid-
ity of the statistical mechanics approach. When all the yardsticks relations
δn/(Γo
Γn) = 1 hold the quasi-stationary state predicted by the MRS ap-
ψ relation, moreover, it is
proach is in agreement with the experimental ω
also the solution of equation (15) at time TS with conserved total moments
Mn and starting from the initial condition φ(σ, x, y, to) = δ(σ
ω0(x, y)).
When not all the yardsticks relations are satisﬁed then the MRS approach
gives an incorrect but approximate prediction of the experimental Ω(ψ) re-
lation. In such a case it still may be possible to obtain a rather sharp initial
distribution, which is determined by the experimental Ω(ψ) relation, such
that the quasi-stationary state is the solution of equation (15) at time TS
and with conserved total moments Mn(TS) = Mn(to).

Hence it maybe concluded that our class of dynamical models with non-
vanishing viscosity and with conserved masses yields a self-consistent dynam-
ical description containing the MRS approach with δ
type initial conditions
in the case that the experimental values of the yardsticks relations are 1 and
with diﬀerent initial conditions in all other cases. In these other cases the
predictive power of the statistical mechanics approach, i.e., the prediction of
the correct QSS on the basis of a δ
type initial condition, is lost and the
−
reconstruction of the correct initial distribution in the context of the models
with conserved masses is a rather diﬃcult if not forbidding problem. In such
cases it may be more convenient to give up the conservation of all masses,
require that only the second moment M2 be conserved and use the Gaussian

distributions of Subsection 88.1 if the ω

A Degrees of mixing

A mass of solute m achieves the highest degree of mixing when it is homoge-
neously distributed over the area A, i.e., when its concentration is constant
and equal to m/A. Let us introduce δ(σ, x, y, t) the spatial distribution of the
σ-species at time t, i.e.,

δ(σ, x, y, t) :=

φ(σ, x, y, t)

m(σ, t) ≥

0,

dx dy δ(σ, x, y, t) = 1.

Z

In order to determine how well mixed is this σ-mass one has to determine
‘how close’ is the corresponding δ(σ, x, y, t) to the homogeneous distribution
1/A. As it is known[1], given two spatial densities, called them δ1(x, y) and
δ2(x, y), there is a one-parameter family of non-negative, convex functionals
a.e.= δ2 and measuring a sort of
dr(δ1, δ2) satisfying dr(δ1, δ2) = 0
distance between them, namely

←→

δ1

dr(δ1, δ2) := [r(1

dx dy δ1(x, y) [1

(δ2(x, y)/δ1(x, y))r]

0, 0 < r < 1,

−

≥

r)]−1

−

Z

and, by imposing continuity in r,

d0(δ1, δ2) :=

dx dy δ1(x, y) ln (δ2(x, y)/δ1(x, y)) ,

d1(δ1, δ2) :=

dx dy δ2(x, y) ln (δ1(x, y)/δ2(x, y)) .

−

−

Z

Z

For r > 1 and for r < 0, they may diverge. However, since in our case
= 0, values r < 0 would also be possible. The dr are not
δ2(x, y) = 1/A
= 1/2, they are asymmetric in their arguments,
distances because, e.g., for r
i.e., dr(δ1, δ2)

= dr(δ2, δ1).

Accordingly, we can measure the mixing degree of the σ-mass by

dr(δ(σ, x, y, t), 1/A).

Its weighted contribution to the total mixing degree will be denoted by
sr(σ, t), i.e.,

−

sr(σ, t) := m(σ, t) [Ar(r

1)]−1

dx dy δ(σ, x, y, t) [1

(1/Aδ(σ, x, y, t))r]

The diﬀerential equations (50) and (52) are of inﬁnite order, however, in

way. For example, when µ(σ) is such that

(68)

where PN (x) and QM (x) are polynomials in x of order N and M, respec-
tively, limx→0 PN (x) = limx→0 QM (x) and q is a parameter such that qσ is

In our experiment, an interface between a viscous liquid and air is deformed by a sink ﬂow of
constant ﬂow rate to form a sharp tip. Using a microscope, the interface shape is recorded down
to a tip size of 1 µm. The curvature at the tip is controlled by the distance h between the tip and

the sink. As a critical distance h
tip becomes cone-shaped. As the distance to the sink is decreased further, the opening angle of the
cone vanishes like h2. No evidence for air entrainment was found, except when the tip was inside
the oriﬁce.

Hydrodynamics very often leads to the spontaneous
formation of very small structures, such as in the sep-
aration of a liquid drop from a nozzle [1, 2], drop coa-
lescence [3], shock waves [4], free-surface cusps [5, 6], or
tips [7, 8, 9]. Mathematically, all the above phenomena
correspond to a singularity [10, 11] of an underlying hy-
drodynamic equation, in which the hydrodynamic ﬁelds
become non-smooth. Hydrodynamic singularities can be
classiﬁed into two groups. In the ﬁrst group of ’true’ sin-
gularities the production of small scales is cut oﬀ only by
a microscopic length, such as the size of a molecule. In
the second group, there exists some hydrodynamic mech-
anism which is able to ’regularize’ the singularity. In the
past, all singularities which persist for a ﬁnite amount
of time were found to belong to the second group, typ-
ical regularizing mechanisms being diﬀusion [4], surface
tension [12], or the presence of an outer liquid [6]. By
contrast, in this letter we describe a stationary tip whose
typical size is not limited by any hydrodynamic mecha-
nism, such as surface tension.

Tips were ﬁrst investigated by G.I. Taylor [7], by plac-
ing a liquid drop of small viscosity in a viscous ﬂow pro-
duced by counter-rotating rollers, stretching the drop.
At its ends, the drop develops tips which become quite
sharp, yet it has never been established whether the tip
remains rounded on some scale [13]. Tips have recently
received intense scrutiny [8, 14, 15] owing to their poten-
tial in producing extremely thin jets, leading to numerous
microﬂuidic applications [14, 16, 17]. In the viscous with-
drawal experiment [8, 15] a liquid is withdrawn through
a straw placed above a liquid-liquid interface, produc-
ing a sharp “hump”. While the curvature of the hump
appears to diverge as the ﬂow rate is increased, the (ap-
parent) singularity is actually cut oﬀ at a typical size of
0.2mm [15], and the hump transforms into a jet.

In the present experiment we replace one of the liq-
uids by a gas, ﬁnding no sign of the disappearance of
the tip. Hence we are able to track the approach to the
singularity (i.e. a divergence of the tip curvature) over
four orders of magnitude, the curvature being described
by a universal scaling law. Three-dimensional axisym-

metric ﬂow thus appears to be fundamentally diﬀerent
from a two-dimensional one [12], in that surface tension
does not succeed in regularizing the tip singularity. The
presence of a singularity also raises exciting prospects to
produce structures by hydrodynamic forcing whose size
is only limited by microscopic features [18].

Our experimental setup, sketched in Fig. 1, consists of
a 27
130 mm cell partially ﬁlled with a viscous liquid
(we used castor oil and two diﬀerent silicone oils). The
liquid ﬂows out of a hole (a = 1 and 3 mm in diameter)
drilled into a circular plate of 0.7 mm thickness. The
ﬂow rate Q
Qout is adjusted to a constant value by
the ball-valve (1), and measured by weighing. To ensure
stationary conditions, the ﬂow rate Qin into the cell is
adjusted by the valve (2) to be almost equal but smaller
than Qout.
In the course of a typical experiment, the
cell empties over a period of 2-6 hours at constant Q,
thus adiabatically changing the ﬁlling height H of the
container.

contains a signiﬁcant time dependence. The interface
shape (cf. Fig. 2) is recorded using a microscope with a
working distance of 20 mm and a a high resolution CCD
camera. The overall resolution of the optics is 1 µm. The
beneﬁt of using gravity to drive the ﬂow is that no un-
steadiness could be detected down to a micron scale, but
we are limited in the achievable ﬂow rates. Our attempts
of using a pump for driving failed owing to unsteadiness
of the interface caused by mechanical vibrations.

Back-lighting ensures a sharp gray-level gradient at the
interface, and proﬁles R(z) were extracted in numerical
form using image processing software. Axisymmetry is
preserved to within our experimental resolution. First
we focus on the development of a sharp tip, shown in
Fig. 2 a),b). To that end we determine the curvature C at
the tip, by ﬁtting a Gaussian and a parabolic proﬁle (cf.
Fig. 2 d)) to it. Fig. 3 shows the curvature as a function of
the distance h from the oriﬁce to the tip for various ﬂow
rates Q, using the same silicone oil of viscosity η = 30

curvature diverges like 1/(h

for all our data sets. Albeit for a limited range, the data
of [9] for H is also consistent with ours.

We now show that the singularity occurs when the
tip experiences a critical viscous forcing, relative to the
smoothing eﬀects of surface tension. Namely, in the limit
of slow ﬂow a point sink in a solid plate produces a ve-
locity 3Q/(2πz2) along the line of symmetry [19], p.140.
Thus equating viscous forcing by the unperturbed ﬂow

if we assume that the point sink is placed a small dis-

creases with ﬂow rate, while gravity tends to ﬂatten the

the dependence on h⋆, given by (2). It is instructive to
also split the r.h.s. of (3) into dependencies on the “in-

where Ca is given by (1). Qualitatively, (4) results from
the ratio of the unperturbed ﬂow speed in the z-direction
and the capillary speed γ/η contracting the proﬁle in the
r-direction, while gravity is irrelevant near the tip.

The slope R′ was determined experimentally by ﬁtting
R(z) with a second order polynomial in
and ex-
trapolating to the tip. The result, shown in Fig. 6, is in
excellent agreement with the predicted slope, in partic-
ular for small opening angles, as expected. The prefac-
tor is 0.43
0.1, only slightly smaller than the predicted
value of 0.5. To estimate the local capillary number,
we included the correction ha deduced from h⋆. This
we believe to be the ﬁrst quantitative test of this classi-
cal slender body theory, previous comparisons being only
qualitative [24]. The shaded region of Fig. 6 corresponds
to smooth proﬁles below the critical capillary number,
where we took the minimum value of R′(z) as the slope.
Its value merges smoothly into the singular region. At
the transition Ca = Ca⋆, the interface slope assumed a
universal value of R′(h⋆) = 0.47
0.06 for all our exper-
iments.

Discussion: Our study was motivated by the afore-
mentioned viscous withdrawal experiment [8, 15], which
found the tip to disappear at a typical size of 200 µm,
independent of the viscosity ratio λ between the two liq-
uids. This diﬀers markedly from both theory [23] and
experiment [24] with drops of small viscosity in strong
ﬂows, which develop tips which are locally similar, but
which remain stable well into the singular regime. We
thus expected the disappearance of the tip [8] to be re-
lated to the far-ﬁeld boundary condition, which is a ﬂat
interface for viscous withdrawal, but a curved interface
for drops.

and and castor oil have capillary lengths ℓc of 1.49 mm
and 1.94 mm respectively, so we have good experimental
evidence that it is indeed ℓc that sets the external length
scale in (3), rather than the size of the cell.

We now turn to the interface shape for h < h⋆, for
which the tip is singular, and the proﬁle meets the tip
with a ﬁnite slope R′(h). As the hole is approached,
the slope becomes small, suggesting the use of slender-
body theory [21, 22, 23]. In this limit, the perturbation
of the axial ﬂow by the interface is small, so it can be

air bubbles suspended above the sink hole [25] give re-
sults very similar to the ones described here, except that
the curvature scaling does not extend to as small values,
owing to the bubble curvature. We have considered a

liquid-air system to behave diﬀerently, yet were not able
to single out a likely mechanism:

suggested [27] as a mechanism to relieve the pressure that
builds up inside a cusp, and which leads to its eventual
disappearance [5]. However, one will require a better
knowledge of the ﬂow near the tip to estimate the cor-
rect pressure balance in the present axisymmetric case.
It should also be noted that once a tip size of 1 micron
is reached, the mean free path of the air will come into
play.

ment occurs. However the indirect evidence of air bub-
bles appearing at the other end of the tube shows that
a spout is formed once the tip enters the oriﬁce. In fact,
this setup has been used to create monodisperse streams
of bubbles [16]. When subsequently the ﬁlling height
H is increased again to raise the tip above the oriﬁce,
no spout is observed. Rather, a stable tip reappears at
h = 0, giving no evidence for hysteresis. Thus the ex-
perimental protocol suggested in [18] fails to produce a
thin spout, a fact that could be related to our far-ﬁeld
conditions being diﬀerent from those of [18].

A theoretical understanding of the scaling law (3) re-
mains a challenge. Likely, such an understanding will
require the description of the entire interface proﬁle.
Rescaling the proﬁles using C−1 as a characteristic scale
has lead to data collapse only in a very limited region
around the tip. Evidently the proﬁles contain several
length scales that need to be included into a proper de-
scription.

In conclusion, we have developed a scaling law for the
formation of an axisymmetric tip singularity on a liquid-
air interface. Singular tips are well described by slender-
body theory. Our analysis raises the possibility of using
hydrodynamics to produce structures of virtually unlim-
ited smallness.

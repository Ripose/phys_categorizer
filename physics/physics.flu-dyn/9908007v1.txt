1 Introduction

In the present paper, we consider an interface between two liquid layers subject to hori-

zontal harmonic vibrations, of amplitude a and frequency ω.

In experimental works by Bezdeneznykh et al. [1] and by Wolf [2] for a long horizontal

reservoir ﬁlled with two immiscible viscous ﬂuids, an interesting phenomenon was found

at the interface: the horizontal vibrations lead to the formation of a steady relief. This

formation mechanism has a threshold nature; it is noteworthy that such a wavy relief appears

on the interface only if the densities of the two ﬂuids are close enough, i.e. it does not appear

for the liquid/gas interface (free surface). The interface is absolutely unstable if the heaviest

ﬂuid occupies the upper layer; i.e., the horizontal vibration does not prevent the evolution

of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, in contrast to the vertical one which under certain conditions

suppresses its evolution. A theoretical description of this phenomenon was provided by

Lyubimov & Cherepanov [3] within the framework of a high frequency (of the vibration)

approximation and an averaging procedure; they found that a horizontal vibration leads

to a quasi-equilibrium state i.e., a state where the mean motion is absent but the interface

oscillates with a small amplitude (of the order of magnitude of the cavity displacement) with

respect to the steady relief. In particular, they found that the relief (in the case of a heavy

ﬂuid occupying the bottom layer) with ﬁnite wavelength is not possible for any thickness of

ﬂuid layers. In fact, the relief with ﬁnite wavelength arises only for considerably thick layers
ρ2))]1/2, where α is the coeﬃcient of surface tension, ρ1 and ρ2
of height h > [3α/ (g (ρ1 −
are the densities of lower and upper layer, respectively; g is the gravity acceleration. In the

approach [3], two parameters were assumed to be asymptotically small simultaneously: (i)
the dimensionless thickness of the viscous skin-layers δ = h−1

ν/ω, ν being the kinematic

viscosity and (ii) the dimensionless amplitude of the vibration ǫ = a/h. But in the limiting

q

case ǫ

0, the possibility of description of parametric resonant eﬀects is absent and only

→

the basic instability mode (Kelvin–Helmholtz, of two counter ﬂows) remains.

In this investigation, the condition ǫ

0 is dropped and the vibration frequency is

considered as relatively low, thus the averaging method could no longer be applied.

2 Problem formulation

Let us consider the system of two immiscible, incompressible liquids ﬁlling rectangular

cavity of length L and height h. In the state of rest the heavy liquid (of density ρ1) occupies

→

1

the bottom region of height h1, and the light liquid (of density ρ2) – the upper region of

height h2 (h = h1 + h2). We choose Cartesian coordinate system in such a way that the

x, y-axis lie in horizontal plane, the z-axis is directed vertically, z = 0 corresponds to the

unperturbed interface. Let the cavity perform harmonic oscillation along the x-axis, with
the amplitude a and frequency ω, and let ~γ be the unit vector along the z-axis, while ~j along

the vibration axis (Fig. 1).

The waves are generated on the interface due to such oscillation, and propagate from

the vertical endwalls to the central part of the cavity. But, if viscosities of the liquids are

not too small, such a waves are damped on relatively short distances from the endwalls.

For example, for transformer oil and glycerine in Earth gravity ﬁeld and angular frequencies

of the vibration of the order of magnitude 102Hz, the damping length ld is of the order

of magnitude of 1 mm. In the following, we assume that the condition L

ld is satisﬁed

≫

and we consider only the central part of the cavity, far away from the endwalls, which the

interface waves generated near the endwalls do not reach. Therefore in the basic state the

interface could be considered as plane and horizontal.

However, the liquid in the central part of the cavity can’t stay at rest, and the velocities

of the liquid motion in the bottom and upper layers must be diﬀerent. Indeed, since the

densities of liquids are diﬀerent, then pressures gradients would be diﬀerent if the velocities in

the layers are equal. The latter is in contradiction with the normal stress balance condition

at the interface. The only exception might be the case of liquids which stay in rest in

laboratory reference frame, but such a situation is impossible because of the incompressibility

conditions. To prove this, let us consider the cross-section of the cavity by the vertical plane

S−+ = S− + S+, attached to the cavity (Fig. 1). Then liquid volume V = Vr− + Vr+ to the

right (for example) of the cross-section is constant. By virtue of the incompressibility the

latter means that in the cavity frame the full liquid consumption through the S−+ must be

zero:

(2.0)

where ξ is the vertical coordinate of the interface. We stress that the FULL consumption

across any vertical cross-section is zero. At the same time the consumptions of individual

liquids can be non-zero if the ﬂow is unsteady because the interface is not at rest near the

vertical endwalls, therefore the volume of each liquid to the right of the cross-section S−+ is

time-dependent. If the liquids stay in rest in the laboratory frame, then in (2.0) the velocities

v1x and v2x are equal and (2.0) could not be satisﬁed. Thus, despite of the statement ”in long

cavity the interface waves generated near the endwalls do not penetrate into the central part

of the cavity”, the motion in the central part is always present and all of the above discussion

gives the opportunity for the approximation of the inﬁnite horizontal layer. Moreover, the

condition (2.0) must be, of course, juncted.

The concrete ﬂow in the inviscid case is obtained in Section 3, the ﬂow in viscous case

– in Section 4.2. We stress as early as in this Section that the basic ﬂow, as is obvious

from (2.0), is of counter-ﬂow type, that makes us to expect the rise of Kelvin–Helmholtz

instability, while the periodic character of the ﬂow allows to expect the parametric resonance

In the cavity frame, the Navier–Stokes equations for the motion could be obtained from

the standard equations written in the laboratory frame by considering the total acceleration,

eﬀects.

The above solution corresponds to a plane-parallel, unsteady, counter ﬂow which keeps the
interface ﬂat ( ξ = 0 ). Note that in the case of equal densities, ~V1 and ~V2 tend to zero,
i.e. ﬂuids stay at rest in the cavity frame. In the case ρ2 ≪
in the laboratory frame ( U1 = aω ).

ρ1 , the lower ﬂuid stays at rest

Thus, in the inviscid case we deal with the stability problem for the interface between two

counter ﬂows, and the diﬀerence in the ﬂows velocities is a periodic function of time. Linear

stability problem could be reduced to the ordinary diﬀerential equation for the amplitude

with

F1 = ρ1 coth(kh1)

and

F2 = ρ2 coth(kh2)

In (3.11), k is the wavenumber of the disturbances, which determines the periodicity of the

solution along vibration axis. It is straightforward to show that stability problem admits the

analogue of Squire’s theorem [4]. The latter gives the possibility of considering only plane

(2D) disturbances.

It is convenient to eliminate from (3.11) the term which contains the ﬁrst order derivative

in ξ . To do so, we make the change of variable [5]

(since Φ is real, then ξ and Y are equal via a modulus, i.e. ξ and Y are equivalent from the

point of view of stability). This results in the standard Mathieu equation for Y :

The equation (3.14) is in dimensionless form, with the following reference quantities for time

and length:

In formulas (3.15) and (3.16), W e1 = ω2lc/g is Weber number based on the capillary length,

ρ = ρ1/ρ2 is densities ratio, H1 = h1/lc and H2 = h2/lc are dimensionless layer thicknesses.

We also introduced the dimensionless parameter Bv, characterizing the vibrations intensity:

Bv =

The solutions of the equation (3.14), which correspond to the neutral boundary, form two

classes: Y+, having period 2π (harmonic disturbances) and Y−, having period π (subharmonic

disturbances). The solutions of subharmonic type are antiperiodic, that means that they

change the sign for a shift of π.

We plot the boundaries of the instability regions (obtained by numerical integration of

the Mathieu equation (3.14)) in terms of the two parameters, Bv and k. The neutral curves

shown in Fig. 2, 3 correspond to Weber numbers equal respectively to W e1 = 10 and

W e1 = 100 (H1 = H2 = 1, ρ = 2).

The left curve in this Figures bounds Kelvin–Helmholtz instability region. In the referred

case H1 = H2 = 1 the most dangerous are longwave disturbances with k = 0. In [3] was
investigated the case W e1 → ∞
H1 = H2 = H then the transition from the longwave instability to the ﬁnite wavelength

with ﬁnite heights of the layers.

It was found that if

instability occurs at H = H∗ = √3. It is straightforward to analyse the case of ﬁnite W e1.

Note, that if k is small, then Q and A are small also, and could be expanded into power

series in k. The result is that at H < H∗ the longwave instability takes place at any values

of W e1, but at H > H∗ only for

W e1 <

(3.17)

In the instability region discussed, the instability mechanism is, in fact, the same as in

the standard case of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability: the velocity grows up and the pressure

falls down over the elevations of the interface. The consequence of this is the reducing of the

eﬀective stiﬀness of the system and, starting from some threshold, the rise of the instability.

As shown in [3], in the case of high frequencies of the vibration the nonlinear developpment

of such instability results in the formation of a quasi-stationary wave relief on the interface.

However, periodic changes of the velocity can result not only in the average eﬀect, but in

the resonance ampliﬁcation of eigenoscillations. Inasmuch as in the absence of the dissipation

7

the eigenoscillations are not damped, then the instability will take place at inﬁnitely small

amplitude of the vibration (if the synchronism condition is satisﬁed). On Fig. 2, 3 the regions

of parametric instability approach the abscissa as narrow ends (”tongues”); the points kn

at which the n-th region of instability is in contact with the k-axis can be evaluated

from the equation A = n2, n = 1, 2, .... As the vibration frequency grows, i.e. as Weber

number increases, the points kn shift to the shortwave region (as seen from Fig. 2,3) and
in the limit W e1 → ∞
vibration the parametric instability can take place only for shortwave disturbances but, for

they are displaced into inﬁnity. Thus, at high frequencies of the

such disturbances, the viscosity could not be ignored. It has to be expected that for big

values of Weber number only the quasi-static instability must be observed, with mechanism

of excitation which is weakly sensitive to the viscosity.

4 2D linear stability problem for viscous ﬂuids

To simplify the following presentation, we assume in this Section that the two layers are

of equal height h1 = h2 = h.

In addition, we non-dimensionalize the problem using the

scales

t∗ = 1/ω;

l∗ = h;

u∗ = aω;

p∗ = ρ2haω2

The above solution corresponds to the plane-parallel unsteady counter ﬂow which keeps the

interface ﬂat ( ξ = 0 ) (to be compared with (3.8)-(3.10) in the inviscid case). The function

Uβ(z) could be found analytically, but its expression is too complicated, so it was determined

numerically. Figure 4 represents the velocity proﬁles at four time instants: (a) t = 0, (b)

t = π/2, (c) t = π, (d) t = 3π/2. The direction of the ﬂow changes every half period of the

external forcing. Note the thin boundary layers at both sides of the interface and near the

walls ( Figs. 4a, 4c).

For the reasons discussed in Section 3, we investigate the stability of the basic state

(4.9), (4.10) with respect to periodic (in time and space) 2D disturbances. If the vibration

9

frequency is high enough, then thin boundary layers occur at the interface (on both sides) and

near the two horizontal walls, making the task of numerical solution particularly complicated.

where n might be taken integer, as well as half-integer. By keeping only a ﬁnite number of

terms of the expansion in both ﬂuids we get 2-point boundary value problems (BVP’s, cou-

pled through the conditions (4.23) - (4.27)), for the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

for the complex amplitudes pnβ(z), unβ(z), wnβ(z) (note that ξn(z) may be eliminated from

(4.23)-(4.27)). The coeﬃcients in the equations depend on z, therefore the system could be

resolved only numerically.

One important feature of the resulting ODE’s systems is that integer and half-integer

harmonics are not coupled (since the basic ﬂow (4.9) introduce only a shift of

1 for n

±

in (4.18)-(4.27)). So, ﬁnally, the corresponding BVP’s can be solved independently. The

11

solutions of the BVP’s involving integer harmonics have the same period as that of the

forcing vibration (harmonic, or synchronous case) and the solutions of the BVP’s involving

half-integer harmonics have a period twice as that of the forcing vibration (subharmonic, or

asynchronous case).

BVP’s, in turn, allow the reduction to initial values problems (IVP’s). We focus our

attention on the synchronous case, since asynchronous solutions were not detected in the

numerical investigation. The numerical procedure is described in [6].

5 Numerical results

The linear stability of the ﬂat interface has been calculated using 21 basis functions

fn(z) in both cases (synchronous and asynchronous). Ten to twelve basis functions are

enough to get suﬃciently accurate numerical results if the dimensionless frequency is not

high (Ω <

250). The number of basis functions has to be increased if Ω > 250.

≈

In Figure 5, we show the neutral stability curves which divide the (k, A)-plane into

regions of stable solutions, and regions (tongues) of unstable (exponentially growing in time)

solutions. The values of the nondimensional parameters are ρ=2, Go=0.16 and W e2=6.25.

Only synchronous solutions were detected. This situation is not unique (for the review

and discussion see [7]). Asymptotic ”inviscid” curves are plotted with solid lines, while

the curves obtained numerically for viscous ﬂuids at diﬀerent values of the dimensionless

frequency Ω1 = Ω2 = Ω, are plotted with dashed lines (note that Ω1 = Ω2 correspond to

ν1 = ν2).

For the high values of Ω (corresponding to small viscosities) the numerical curves ap-

proach the bottom of the asymptotic tongues, which correspond to an instability threshold,

but lower and lower (Fig. 5). As Ω decreases (or the viscosities increase), the instability

threshold grows (Fig. 6). We state that viscosity has a weak inﬂuence on the Kelvin–

Helmholtz instability, but strongly damps the parametric instability associated with the

excitation of capillary-gravity waves. In addition, as seen in Figures 5,6, at some critical

frequency 100 < Ω∗ < 250, the boundary of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability region unites with

the boundary of the resonant zone, so that at smaller frequencies there exists a single neutral

curve corresponding to each frequency value. This means that in the case of rather viscous

ﬂuids the diﬀerence between the parametric and non-parametric instabilities vanishes.

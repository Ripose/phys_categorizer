GENERALIZED STRESS CONCENTRATION FACTORS FOR
EQUILIBRATED FORCES AND STRESSES

REUVEN SEGEV

Abstract. As a sequel to a recent work we consider the generalized stress
concentration factor, a purely geometric property of a body that for the var-
ious loadings, indicates the ratio between the maximum of the optimal stress
and maximum of the loading ﬁelds. The optimal stress concentration factor
pertains to a stress ﬁeld that satisﬁes the principle of virtual work and for
which the stress concentration factor is minimal. Unlike the previous work, we
require that the external loading be equilibrated and that the stress ﬁeld be a
symmetric tensor ﬁeld.
Keywords. Continuum mechanics, forces, stresses, stress concentration fac-
tor, trace, integrable deformations.

1. Introduction

In a recent article [7] we introduced the notion of a generalized stress concentra-
tion factor as a quantitative measure of how bad is the geometry of a body in terms
of the ratio between the maximal stresses and the maximum of the applied loads.
Speciﬁcally, generalized stress concentration factors may be described as follows.
Let F be a force on a body Ω that is given in terms of a body force ﬁeld b and
a surface force ﬁeld t and let σ be any stress ﬁeld that is in equilibrium with F .
Then, the stress concentration factor for the pair F , σ is given by

KF,σ =

supx {|σ(x)|}
supx,y {|b(x)| , |t(y)|}

,

x ∈ Ω, y ∈ ∂Ω.

Here, for |σ(x)| we use some norm |·| on the space of stresses at a point—a ﬁnite
dimensional space. We note that since we do not specify a constitutive relation, for
each force F there is a class ΣF of stress ﬁelds σ that are in equilibrium with F .
Next, the optimal stress concentration factor for the force F is deﬁned by

KF = inf
σ∈ΣF

{KF,σ} ,

i.e., it is the least stress concentration factor when we allow the stress ﬁeld to
vary over all ﬁelds that are in equilibrium with F . Finally, the generalized stress
concentration factor K—a purely geometric property of Ω—is deﬁned by

K = sup

{KF } = sup

F

inf σ∈ΣF {supx {|σ(x)|}}
supx,y {|b(x)| , |t(y)|}

where F varies over all forces that may be applied to the body. Thus, the generalized
stress concentration factor reﬂects the worst case of loading of the body.

It was shown in [7] that the generalized stress concentration factor is equal to
the norm of a mapping associated with the trace operator of Sobolev mappings.
Speciﬁcally, it was shown that when suprema in the expressions above are replaced
by essential suprema, then,

K =

1 (Ω, R3) on ∂Ω

where W 1
gradients ∇φ are also integrable, and ˆφ is the trace of φ ∈ W 1
(whose existence is a basic property of Sobolev spaces).
Consider the Radon measure µ on Ω deﬁned by

µ(D) = V (D ∩ Ω) + A(D ∩ ∂Ω)

(V and A are the volume and area measures, respectively), and let L1,µ(Ω, R3)
be the space of ﬁelds on Ω that are integrable relative to µ equipped with the
L1,µ-norm so

kwkL1,µ =

|w| dV +

|w| dA.

ZΩ

Z∂Ω

1 (Ω, R3) → L1,µ(Ω, R3)
Then, the trace operator induces an extension mapping δ : W 1
and the expression for the generalized stress concentration factor above may be
written in the form

K = kδk

—the basic result of [7].

The treatment in [7] allows stresses and forces that are more general than those
treated usually in continuum mechanics. In addition to the usual stress tensor σim
the stress object contains a self force ﬁeld σi. Furthermore, the stress ﬁeld need
not be symmetric and the resultants and total torques due to the forces F need not
vanish. The generalized form of the equilibrium equations between the forces and
stresses was taken in the form

biwi dV +

tiwi dA =

σiwi dV +

σikwi,k dV.

Thus, the inﬁmum in the deﬁnition of the optimal stress concentration factor may
be attained for a stress ﬁeld that is not admissible physically.

In the present work we restrict the admissible stress ﬁelds to symmetric tensor
ﬁelds and the forces are required to have zero resultants and total torques. These
requirements are well known to be equivalent to the requirements that the power
produced by the forces and stresses on rigid velocity ﬁelds vanishes.

The expression for the generalized stress concentration factor we obtain here for

the rigid velocity invariant forces and stresses may be written as

K = kδ/Rk ,

STRESS CONCENTRATIONS AND EQUILIBRIUM – February 2, 2008

where R denotes the collection of rigid velocity ﬁelds, a subspace of the function-
spaces we are considering. The extension mapping

δ/R : LD(Ω)/R −→ L1,µ(Ω, R3)/R
between the corresponding quotient spaces is given by δ/R([w]) = [δ(w)]. It is well
deﬁned for elements of the space LD(Ω) containing the vector ﬁelds w of integrable
stretchings

ε(w) =

(∇w + (∇w)T ).

The space LD(Ω) and its properties (see [11, 12, 8, 10, 1, 2], and [4] for nonlinear
strains) are the main technical tools we use in this work.

For a projection mapping that gives an approximating rigid velocity ﬁeld to any
vector ﬁeld w and a corresponding w0 that has zero rigid component, this result
may be written more speciﬁcally as

K = kδ0k =

Section 2 presents some properties of rigid velocity ﬁelds, stretchings and the
approximations of velocity ﬁelds by rigid ones. Section 3 outlines the deﬁnitions
and results pertaining to the space LD(Ω) and is based on [11]. Finally, Section 4
applies the properties of LD-ﬁelds to the problem under consideration. Some details
regarding the notation we use and results on normed spaces and their normed dual
spaces are available in [7].

I wish to thank R. Kohn for pointing the BD-literature to me and F. Ebobisse

for his Ph.D. thesis and comments on it.

2. Preliminaries on Stretchings and Rigid Velocities

2.1. Basic deﬁnitions. Let Ω be an open and bounded 3-dimensional submanifold
of R3 with volume |Ω| having a diﬀerentiable boundary and w a vector ﬁeld over
Ω. We set ε(w) to be the tensor ﬁeld

ε(w)im =

(wi,m + wm,i),

1
2

i.e., the symmetric part of the gradient. As w is interpreted physically as a velocity
ﬁeld over the body, ε(w) is interpreted as the stretching. Alternatively, if w is
interpreted as an inﬁnitesimal displacement ﬁeld, ε(w) is the corresponding linear
strain. In the sequel we will refer to ε(w) as the stretching associated with w. Here,
the partial derivatives are interpreted as the distributional derivatives so one need
not care about the regularity of w.

We identify the space of symmetric 3 × 3 matrices with R6. For a symmetric

tensor ﬁeld ε whose components are integrable functions we use the L1-norm

kεk =

kεimkL1 .

i,m
X

4

REUVEN SEGEV

This norm maybe replaced by other equivalent norms (possibly norms invariant
under coordinate transformations). Thus, the space of L1-stretching ﬁelds is rep-
resented by L1(Ω, R6) with the L1-norm as above.

A vector ﬁeld w on Ω is of integrable stretching if its components are integrable
and if each component ε(w)im ∈ L1(Ω).
It can be shown that this deﬁnition
is coordinate independent. The vector space of velocity ﬁelds having integrable
stretchings will be denoted by LD(Ω). This space is normed by

kwkLD =

kwikL1 +

kε(w)imkL1 .

i
X

i,m
X

Clearly, we have a continuous linear inclusion LD(Ω, R3) −→ L1(Ω, R3). In addi-
tion, w 7→ ε(w) is given by a continuous linear mapping

ε : LD(Ω) −→ L1(Ω, R6).

2.2. The subspace of rigid velocities. A rigid velocity (or displacement) ﬁeld
is of the form

w(x) = a + ω × x,

x ∈ Ω

where a and ω are ﬁxed in R3 and ω × x is the vector product. We can replace ω × x
with ˜ω(x) where ˜ω is the associated skew symmetric matrix so w(x) = a + ˜ω(x).
We will denote the 6-dimensional space of rigid body velocities by R. For a rigid
motion

˜ωim =

(wi,m − wm,i),

1
2

an expression that is extended to the non-rigid situation and deﬁnes the vorticity
vector ﬁeld so wi,m = ε(w)im + ˜ωim.

Considering the kernel of the stretching mapping ε : LD(Ω) −→ L1(Ω, R6), a
theorem whose classical version is due to Liouville states (see [11, pp. 18–19]) that
Kernel ε = R.

2.3. Approximation by rigid velocities. We now wish to consider the approx-
imation of a velocity ﬁeld by a rigid velocity ﬁeld. Let ρ be a Radon measure on Ω
and 1 6 p 6 ∞. For a given w ∈ Lp,ρ(Ω, R3), we wish to ﬁnd the rigid velocity r

Particularly simple are the equations for p = 2. In this case we obtain

If we interpret ρ as a mass distribution on Ω, these two conditions simply state
that the best rigid velocity approximations should give the same momentum and
angular momentum as the original ﬁeld.

Of particular interest (see [11, p. 120]) is the case where ρ is the volume measure

on Ω. Set ¯x to be the center of volume of Ω, i.e.,

¯x =

x dV.

|Ω|

ZΩ

Without loss of generality we will assume that ¯x = 0 (for else we may replace x by
x − ¯x in the sequel).

Let ¯w be the mean of the ﬁeld w and I the inertia matrix relative to the center

of volume, so

and

¯w =

w dV,

Iim =

The inertia matrix is symmetric and positive deﬁnite and so the solution for r gives

Thus, w 7→ ( ¯w+ω ×x), with ¯w and ω as above, is well deﬁned for integrable velocity
ﬁelds and we obtain a mapping

It is straightforward to show that πR is indeed a linear projection onto R.

Also of interest below will be the case where p = 1 and and the measure ρ is

given by

ρ(D) = µ(D) = V (D ∩ Ω) + A(D ∩ ∂Ω),

2.4. Distortions. Let W be a vector space of velocities on Ω containing the rigid
velocities R and let w1 and w2 be two velocity ﬁelds in W. We will say that the two
have the same distortion if w2 = w1 + r for some rigid motion r ∈ R. This clearly
generates an equivalence relation on W and the corresponding quotient space W/R
will be referred to as the space of distortions. If χ is an element of W/R then ε(w)
is the same for all members of w ∈ χ. The natural projection

π : W −→ W/R

associates with each element w ∈ W its equivalence class [w] = {w + r|r ∈ R}.

If w is a normed space, then, the induced norm on w/R is given by (see Appendix

A)

k[w]k = inf

w′∈[w]

kw′k = inf
r∈R

kw − rk .

Thus, the evaluation of the norm of a distortion, is given by the best approximation
by a rigid velocity as described above.

Let W be a vector space of velocities contained in L1(Ω, R3), then, πR deﬁned

above induces an additional projection

π0(w) = w − πR(w).
The image of π0 is the kernel W0 of πR and it is the subspace of W containing
velocity ﬁelds having zero approximating rigid velocities. Clearly, we have a bijec-
tion β : W/R → W0. On W0 we have two equivalent norms: the norm it has as a
subspace of W and the norm that makes the bijection β : W/R → W0 an isometry.
With the projections π0 and πR, W has a Whitney sum structure W = W0 ⊕R.

2.5. Equilibrated forces. Let W be a vector space of velocities (we assume that
it contains the rigid velocities). A force F ∈ W∗ is equilibrated if F (r) = 0 for
all r ∈ R. This is of course equivalent to F (w) = F (w + r) for all r ∈ R so F
∗
∗
induces a unique element of (W/R)
. Conversely, any element of G ∈ (W/R)
induces an equilibrated force F by F (w) = G([w]), where [w] is the equivalence
class of w. In other words, as the quotient projection is surjective, the dual map-
ping π∗ : (W/R)∗ → W∗ is injective and its image—the collection of equilibrated
forces—is orthogonal to the kernel of π. Furthermore, as in Appendix A, π∗ is
norm preserving. Thus, we may identify the collection of equilibrated forces in W∗
∗
with (W/R)

.

If ιR : R → W is the inclusion of the rigid velocities, then,

R : W∗ −→ R∗,
ι∗

is a continuous and surjective mapping. The image ι∗
R(F ) will be referred to as
the total of the force. In particular, its component dual to ¯w will be referred to as

STRESS CONCENTRATIONS AND EQUILIBRIUM – February 2, 2008

7

the force resultant and the component dual to ω will be referred to as the resultant
torque. Thus, in particular, the resultant force and torque vanish for an equilibrated
force. This structure may be illustrated by the sequences

0 −−−−→ R

3. Fields of Integrable Stretchings

In this section we list the basic properties of vector ﬁelds of integrable stretching
(or deformation) as in [11] (see also [12, 8, 10, 1, 2] and [4] for nonlinear strains). The
presentation below is adapted to the application we consider and is not necessarily
the most general.

If both w and ε(w) are in Lp for 1 < p < ∞, the Korn inequality (see [3])
implies that w ∈ W 1
1 (Ω). This would imply in particular that w has a trace on
the boundary of Ω. However, as shown by Ornstein [5], w need not necessarily be
1 (Ω, R3) for the critical value p = 1. Nevertheless, the theory of integrable
in W 1
stretchings shows that the trace is well deﬁned even for p = 1.

3.1. Deﬁnition. We recall that LD(Ω) is the vector space of ﬁelds with integrable
stretchings. With the norm

kwkLD =

kwikL1 +

kε(w)imkL1

i
X

i,m
X

LD(Ω) is a Banach space.

3.2. Approximation. C∞(Ω, R3) is dense in LD(Ω).

3.3. Traces. The trace operator can be extended from W 1
Thus, there is a unique continuous linear mapping

1 (Ω, R3) onto LD(Ω, R3).

γ : LD(Ω) −→ L1(∂Ω, R3)

such that γ(w) = w

, for every ﬁeld w of bounded stretching that is a restriction

∂Ω

to Ω of a continuous ﬁeld on the closure Ω. Thus, the norm of the trace mapping
is given by

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

As a result of the approximation of ﬁelds of bounded stretchings by smooth vector
ﬁelds on Ω, kγk may be evaluated using smooth vector ﬁelds in the expression
above, i.e.,

kγk = sup

3.4. Extensions. There is a continuous linear extension operator

such that E(w)(x) = w(x) for almost all x ∈ Ω.

8

REUVEN SEGEV

3.5. Regularity. If w is any distribution on Ω whose corresponding stretching is
L1, then w ∈ L1(Ω, R3).

3.6. Distortions of integrable stretching. On the space of LD-distortions,
LD(Ω)/R, we have a natural norm

This norm is equivalent to

kχk = inf
w∈χ

kwkLD .

kε(χ)k =

kε(w)imkL1

i,m
X
where w is any member of χ. Clearly, the value of this expression is the same for
all members w ∈ χ and we can use any other equivalent norm on the space of
symmetric tensor ﬁelds.

Using the projection πR as above we denote by LD(Ω)0 the kernel of πR and

by π0 the projection onto LD(Ω)0 so

(π0, πR) : LD(Ω) −→ LD(Ω)0 ⊕ R.

Then, there is a constant C depending only on Ω such that

kπ0(w)kL1 = kw − πR(w)kL1 6 C kε(w)kL1 .

3.7. Equivalent norms. Let p be a continuous seminorm on LD(Ω) which is a
norm on R. Then,

is a norm on LD(Ω) which is equivalent to the original norm in 3.1.

p(w) + kε(w)kL1

4. Application to Equilibrated Forces and Stresses

4.1. LD-velocity ﬁelds and forces. The central object we consider is LD(Ω)
whose elements are referred to as LD-velocity ﬁelds. Elements of the dual space
will be referred to as LD-forces. Our objective is to represent LD-forces
LD(Ω)
by stresses and by pairs containing body forces and surface forces.

∗

Rather than the original norm of 3.1 it will be convenient to use an equivalent

norm as asserted by 3.7 as follows. Let

be the continuous linear projection deﬁned in Paragraph 2.3 and let q : R → R, be
a norm on the ﬁnite dimensional R. Then,

πR : LD(Ω) −→ R

p = q ◦ πR : LD(Ω) −→ R

kwk

′
LD = q (πR(w)) + kε(w)kL1

is a continuous seminorm that is a norm on R ⊂ LD(Ω). It follows from 3.7 that

is a norm on LD(Ω) which is equivalent to the original norm deﬁned in 3.1.

STRESS CONCENTRATIONS AND EQUILIBRIUM – February 2, 2008

4.2. LD-distortions. With the norm k·k
given by

′

LD, the induced norm on LD(Ω)/R is

so using πR(r) = r, ε(r) = 0 and choosing r = −πR(w), we have

k[w]k

LD = inf
r∈R

kw + rk

k[w]k

{q(πR(w) + r) + kε(w)kL1}

LD = inf
r∈R

r∈R

= kε(w)kL1 .

Let π0 : LD(Ω) → LD(Ω)0 be the projection onto LD(Ω)0 ⊂ LD(Ω), the kernel

of πR. Then,

kπ0(w)k

′
LD = kw − πR(w)k

′
LD

= q(πR(w − πR(w))) + kε(w − πR(w))kL1
= kε(w)kL1 .

We conclude that with our choice of norm k·k

′
LD on LD(Ω), the two norms in
3.6 are not only equivalent but are actually equal. Thus, this choice makes LD(Ω)0
isometrically isomorphic to LD(Ω)/R.

4.3. Equilibrated LD-forces and their representations by stresses. Sum-

Here, Liouville’s rigidity theorem implies that the kernels of ε and π are identical,

4.4. µ-integrable distortions and equilibrated forces on bodies. Following
[7] we use L1,µ(Ω, R3) to denote the space of integrable vector ﬁelds on Ω whose
restrictions to ∂Ω are integrable relative to the area measure on ∂Ω. On this space
we use the norm

kwkL1,µ =

|w| dV +

|w| dA = kwkL1(Ω,R3) + kwkL1(∂Ω,R3) .

ZΩ

Z∂Ω

Alternatively, the L1,µ-norm may be regarded as the L1-norm relative to the Radon
measure µ, deﬁned above and hence the notation.

Forces, being elements of the dual space L1,µ(Ω, R3)∗, may be identiﬁed with
elements of L∞,µ(Ω, R3). A force F on a body, given in terms of a body force b
and a surface force t, may be identiﬁed with a continuous linear functional relative
to the L1,µ-norm if the body force components bi and surface force components ti
(alternatively, |b| and |t|) are essentially bounded relative to the volume and area
measures, respectively. In this case, the representation is of the form

F (w) =

4.5. LD-forces represented by body forces and surface forces. Using the
trace operator γ, for each w ∈ LD(Ω) we may deﬁne

δ(w) : Ω → R3

by δ(w)(x) = w(x) for x ∈ Ω and δ(w)(y) = γ(w)(y) for y ∈ ∂Ω. The trace
theorem 3.3 and the original deﬁnition in 3.1 of the norm on LD(Ω) imply that we
deﬁned a linear and continuous mapping

By the linearity of the extension mapping and using δ(r) = r for r ∈ R, we set

δ : LD(Ω) −→ L1,µ(Ω, R3).

In particular, the image under δ∗ of an equilibrated force F ∈ L∞,µ(Ω, R3) is an
equilibrated LD-force.

As the norm of a mapping and its dual are equal, we have1

Using the fact that the two mappings π∗ are isometric injections onto the respec-
tive subspaces of equilibrated forces, we may replace G above by an equilibrated
force F ∈ L∞,µ(Ω, R3), and (δ/R)∗(G) = (ε/R)∗(σ) is replaced by δ∗(F ) = ε∗(σ).
Thus, we obtain

Remark 4.1. If we want to regard δ/R as a mapping between function spaces we
should use the decompositions of the respective spaces into Whitney sums. We
already noted that LD(Ω)/R is isometrically isomorphic to LD(Ω)0—the space
of LD-vector ﬁelds having zero rigid components. Now L1,µ(Ω, R3)0 is bijective
to L1,µ(Ω, R3)/R but as a subspace of L1,µ(Ω, R3) it has a diﬀerent norm (see
Paragraph 2.4). Since we are interested in the quotient norm in order to use the
essential supremum for the dual norm, we will endow L1,µ(Ω, R3)0 with the quotient
norm kw0k = inf r∈R kw0 − rkL1,µ— which brings us back to the problem of best

Again, one may use smooth vector ﬁelds to evaluate the supremum as these are

Appendix A. Elementary Properties of Quotient Spaces

We describe below some elementary properties of quotient spaces of normed

spaces (e.g., [9, p. 227]).

A.1. The quotient norm. Let W be a normed vector space with a norm k·k and
R a closed subspace of W (e.g., a ﬁnite dimensional subspace). Then, the quotient
norm k·k0 is deﬁned on W/R by

kw0k = inf
w∈w0
Denoting by π : W −→ W/R the natural linear projection π(w) = [w], we clearly
have

kwk .

kπ(w)k0 = kπ(w + r)k0 = inf
r∈R

kw + rk ,

for any r ∈ R. The quotient norm makes the projection mapping π continuous and
the topology it generates on the quotient space is equivalent to quotient topology.

A.2. Dual spaces. We note that as the projection π is surjective, its dual mapping
π∗ : (W/R)∗ −→ W∗

is injective. Clearly, it is linear and continuous relative to the dual norms.
φ ∈ Image π∗ so φ = π∗(φ0), φ0 ∈ (W/R)∗, then, for each r ∈ R,

If

φ(r) = π∗(φ0)(r)
= φ0(π(r))
= φ0(0)
= 0.

On the other hand, if for φ ∈ W∗, φ(r) = 0 for all r ∈ R, then, we may deﬁne
φ0 ∈ (W/R)∗ by φ0(w0) = φ(w), for some w ∈ W such that π(w) = w0. The choice
of w ∈ w0 is immaterial because φ(w + r) = φ(w) + φ(r) = φ(w), for any r ∈ R.
We conclude that

Image π∗ = R⊥ = {φ ∈ W∗ | φ(r) = 0 for all r ∈ R}.

Next we consider the dual norm of elements of the dual to the quotient space.

For φ0 ∈ (W/R)∗, we have

kφ0k = sup

w0∈W/R

|φ0(w0)|
kw0k0

.

Thus,

kφ0k = sup

for some w ∈ w0

for some w ∈ w0

We conclude that π∗ is norm preserving.

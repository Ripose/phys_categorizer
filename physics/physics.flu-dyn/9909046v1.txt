Abstract

We ﬁnd that studying the simplest of the coupled non-equilibrium
growth equations of Barabasi by self-consistent mode coupling requires
the use of dressed vertices. Using the vertex renormalization, we ﬁnd a
roughening exponent which already in the leading order is quite close
to the numerical value.

Models of interfacial growth have attracted a tremendous amount of at-
tention since the pioneering work of Kardar, Parisi, Zhang (KPZ) [1,2]. A
variety of interesting issues are associated with the KPZ equation and they
have given rise to a variety of novel techniques [3]. Among the ﬁrst analytic
techniques used to tackle the KPZ system were the dynamic renormaliza-
tion group (DRG) [4] and the self-consistent mode coupling scheme (SCMC)
[5,6]. An important variant of the KPZ system was introduced by Ertaas
and Kardar [7] and Barabasi [8]. This variant consisted of two coupled ﬁelds
(as opposed to one ﬁeld in KPZ) and is useful for studying the eﬀects of
In these coupled
a second non-equilibrium ﬁeld on the growing interface.
ﬁeld problems DRG has been employed, as also numerical techniques. One
does not always get a stable ﬁxed point with the DRG analysis which may
sometimes indicate a failure of the perturbation scheme or may indicate a
basic instability of the system. It is interesting to note that in many cases
the exponents coming from the one-loop DRG analysis are not in very good
agreement with the numerical analysis. This is exempliﬁed in the simplest
situation treated by Barabasi - an essentially linear system coupled according
to

with < N1,2(x1, t1) N1,2(x2, t2) > = 2D1,2 δ(x1 −

x2) δ(t1 −

t2).

The ﬁeld φ satisﬁes the Edwards-Wilkinson equation and the ﬁeld ψ is
coupled linearly via a gradient coupling to the φ-ﬁeld. While the Edwards-
Wilkinson model can be exactly solved, this is not true for eqn.(2) because of
the multiplicative noise (note that φ is a random ﬁeld). The DRG recursion
relations in this case yield for the roughening exponent α of the ψ-ﬁeld, the
value α = 5/6 while the numerical value of α is nearly 0.68. The dynamical
exponent z of the ψ-ﬁeld is found to be 2. Thus, in this case the dynamic
exponent for both φ and ψ ﬁelds is found to be 2. We will call this ”extended”
dynamic scaling i.e. the time scale is independent of the nature of the ﬁeld
[9]. As it turns out, this is the only situation for this case. However this
need not always be so. In another model considered by Ertaas and Kardar
and Barabasi,

there are two possibilities:

i)zφ = zψ = 3/2, this is the extended dynamic scaling and is found to be the
correct situation for λ > 0 with λ1 > 0,
ii) zφ = 3/2, but zψ = 2, this situation is obtained for λ < 0 with λ1 > 0 and
can be described as ”weak” scaling [9]. For problems involving two or more
coupled ﬁelds, one needs to diﬀerentiate between ”extended” and ”weak”
scaling.

In the one-dimensional KPZ, the perturbative DRG is exact (due to the
existence of a ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation), but this is not true for the
coupled system in one dimension.The self-consistent mode coupling (SCMC)
which has been reasonably succesful for the KPZ, has never been attempted
in the coupled system. In this note, we apply the SCMC to the coupled sys-
tem to see if it is a quantitatively better scheme than the perturbative DRG.
In all known situations,
In the process, we ﬁnd something quite unusual.
SCMC has been succesful in cases where the vertex is not renormalized.
This, in contrast, is a situation where the momentum dependence of the
dressed vertex is absolutely essential. This is what makes the application of
SCMC interesting in this problem and should act as a prototype for situa-
tions where dressed vertices are unavoidable. Writing eqns. (1) and (2) in
momentum space, we have

The basic elements of the calculation are the Green’s functions Gφ(k, ω)
and Gψ(k, ω), the correlation functions Cφ(k, ω) and Cψ(k, ω) and the vertex
function Λ(k, q, k

where we have used eq.(8) and eq.(9) in the Lorentzian approximation,
i.e. during the frequency convolution, Σψ(k, ω) has been replaced by its zero
frequency form.

Our ﬁrst observation is that within the extended dynamic scaling, we
expect zψ = 2. We need to examine if this is self-consistent. Setting Σ(k) =
Γk2, we have

where ˜Γ2 = Γ2 + Γ.
The long wave length property (k

side is best seen by changing to the symmetric variables p′ = −k

This integral is divergent and needs to be cut-oﬀ at o(k), which spoils the
k2 behaviour. The only way this can be prevented is by setting 3Γ1 = ˜Γ2,
which makes the o(k2) contribution of Σ vanish, i.e. implies Γ = 0 and this
establishes

which is in exact agreement with the earlier work of Barabasi.

being k−1−2α. In the absence of λ, α = 1/2 and the extra roughness pro-
duced by this added noise is expected to raise α beyond 1/2. Our expectation,

then is that the second term will dominate in eqn.(15). The power count of
k−4−2α which cannot
the second term in eqn.(15) shows that Cψ(k, ω)
match the power count of the left hand side for any value of α and hence
a self-consistent formulation requires the vertex to acquire a momentum de-
pendence. Dressing the vertex leads to the diagram in Fig.1b. Dropping the
ﬁrst term on the right hand side of eqn.(15) and dressing the vertex in the
second leads to

Once again, the dressed vertex Λ that we are interested in corresponds to
k
0. This vertex scales as q on the left hand side. Power count of the right
hand side shows that it is a linear function of momentum as well and thus the
two sides are matched in exponents. To impose the amplitude inconsistency,
we evaluate the integral on the right hand side in the dominant region which
corresponds to small values of p. This leads to

This is to be compared with the numerical value of α = 0.68. For a
more careful analysis, eqns.(17) and (19) have to be solved numerically. This
is an extremely formidable task because the dependence of Λ on the three
variables (two independent) has to be charted out.

As a ﬁnal point, one would like to show that in this particular case,
If zψ were to be diﬀerent from

2, then for Σ(k, ω) to be at all relevant, zψ has to be smaller than 2.This
means eqn.(12), would at zero frequency become (we now include the vertex
correction)

Simple power counting shows that with Λ

p, zψ = 2, which contradicts
our starting assumption that zψ < 2 and hence there is no self-consistent
solution of the weak scaling variety.

∝

We have checked to ensure that for the extended scaling case, the self-
consistent scheme does give the roughening exponent. Whether, the scheme
can be made to work for the weak scaling situation is under consideration.

Single-point hot-wire measurements in the bulk of a turbulent channel have been performed
in order to detect and quantify the phenomenon of preferential bubble accumulation. We show
that statistical analysis of the bubble-probe colliding-times series can give a robust method for
investigation of clustering in the bulk regions of a turbulent ﬂow where, due to the opacity of the
ﬂow, no imaging technique can be employed. We demonstrate that micro-bubbles (R0 ≃ 100 µm)
in a developed turbulent ﬂow, where the Kolmogorov length-scale is η ≃ R0, display preferential
concentration in small scale structures with a typical statistical signature ranging from the dissipative
range, O(η), up to the lower end of inertial range, O(100η). A comparison with Eulerian-Lagrangian
numerical simulations is also performed and arising similarities and diﬀerences are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of preferential concentration of small particles and bubbles in turbulent ﬂows enjoys increasing
attention in recent years, the studies ranging from experimental works, [1], to numerical investigations, [2], [3], [4], [5]
and theory developments, [6], [7]. Preferential accumulation may be understood as an inertial eﬀect. Due to inertia
the Lagrangian particle/bubble velocity is not always aligned with the surrounding incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow velocity
and this leads to the consequence that particles heavier than the ﬂuid are on average ejected from vortices, while light
buoyant particles tend to accumulate in high vorticity regions.

The scenario is complicated by the fact that a certain number of other physical eﬀects may play a role. First,
apart from body forces like gravity and added mass, there are in general surface forces acting on the particles, as for
example drag and lift, whose expressions especially in unsteady ﬂow conditions are not completely understood. For a
discussions on the dynamics of a single particle settling in still ﬂuid and for the rise of a single bubble we refer to [8], [9],
[10], [11]. Such forces may in principle produce additional non trivial eﬀects on the clustering mechanism. Secondly,
the coupling of the disperse phase on the ﬂuid ﬂow (two-way coupling) and the ﬁnite-size eﬀect of particle-particle
interaction (4-way coupling) may also result in non-negligible factors of perturbation for preferential concentration of
particles in highly turbulent ﬂows.

Small air bubbles in water, below the millimeter size, i.e. of typical Reynolds number of order O(1), can be regarded
as a particular kind of non-deformable light spherical particles with density negligibly small compared to the ﬂuid one.
In fact, in this size-range, shape oscillations or deformations and wake induced eﬀect can be reasonably neglected.
Strong preferential accumulation in core vortex regions is therefore expected according to the inertia mechanism, see
for instance the experimental visualizations realized by Douady et al. [12]. An explorative experimental investigation
on the relevant features of microbubbles clustering in a developed turbulent ﬂow is the focus of the present paper.

Experimental measurements on bubbly laden turbulent ﬂows are challenging. Even at very low void fractions
(∼ 1%) the ﬂuid tends to be completely opaque and diﬃcult, if not impossible, to access with external optical methods,
especially in the bulk region of the ﬂow. Recently, we have performed a series of experiments in order to understand
the eﬀect of bubbles, [13], and microbubbles, [14], on the turbulent energy spectra. Numerics based on Eulerian-
Lagrangian description also have been successfully employed to predict the same eﬀects in similar ﬂow conditions,
[15], [16]. In particular, it has been demonstrated that for low void fractions, up to few percents, microbubbles induce
an energy decrease at large scales and an energy enhancement at small scales. For these kind of experiments, where
the main focus was on ﬂuid velocity, a traditional intrusive hot-wire anemometer has been adopted, the disturbances
associated to bubbles hitting the probe were successively identiﬁed and ﬁltered out when computing ﬂuid turbulent
spectra, [17], [18].

FIG. 1: A typical voltage, V (t), signal from the hot-wire anemometer, a spike is produced by a hitting micro-bubble. Due to
the internal electrical impedence of the acquiring set-up we consider the signal’s perturbation fully restored after 10−2 sec. The
inset shows for the same event, the voltage time derivative normalized by the mean velocity standard deviation (dudt). The
dotted line shows the level of the threshold adopted for bubble identiﬁcations.

One could object that measurement from one ﬁxed point in space are too intrusive because they can destroy the
clusters, or that they are ineﬀective in extracting features of the bubble trapping in turbulent vortical structures.
However, in this paper we analyze the series of the bubble colliding times on the hot-wire probe from the Twente
experiment by means of appropriate statistical indicators. We show that it is possible to detect and quantify the
micro-bubble clustering from a one-point measurement set-up. We compare experimental ﬁndings with results from
numerical simulations based on Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. Due to limitations that we will discuss later, at best
only a qualitative agreement among numerics and experiments is expected. Nevertheless, we show how this comparison
is helpful in clarifying the trend in the clustering at changing the turbulent conditions.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experimental set-up, as previously mentioned, is the Twente water channel, a vertical duct of square cross
section with dimension 200cm × 45cm × 45 cm, we refer to Rensen et al. [13] for a detailed description. An array of
porous ceramic plates, positioned on the top of the channel, is used to generate co-ﬂowing small bubbles of average
radius, R0 ≃ 100µm, as described in [14]. Fluid turbulence is generated by means of an active grid, positioned
immediately downstream the bubble injection sites. The typical ﬂow is characterized by a large mean ﬂow, U , with
turbulent ﬂuctuations, u′ ≡ urms, of smaller amplitude. The condition u′/U ≪ 1 assures that Taylor’s frozen-ﬂow
hypothesis can be applied. The dissipative Kolmogorov scale measures typically η = 400 ÷ 500 µm, while the Taylor
micro-scale and the integral one, are respectively λ ≃ 30 η, and L0 ≃ 4 ÷ 5 · 103 η. The typical bubble size is of the
same order, or weakly smaller, than η.
We consider microbubble signals extracted from a hot-ﬁlm anemometry probe (300 µm in size) ﬁxed at the center of
the channel. Detection of micro-bubbles is luckily less ambiguous than for large bubbles where probe piercing and
break-up events are highly probable [19]. A micro-bubble hitting the probe produces a signal with a clear spike and
the bubble can be identiﬁed by threshold check on the velocity time-derivative signal, see Fig. 1. This identiﬁcation
procedure leads to the deﬁnition of a minimal cut-oﬀ time in the capability to detect clustered events, two consecutive
bubbles in our records cannot have a separation time smaller than τ = 10−2sec. Such dead-time is mainly linked to
the typical response-time of the acquisition set-up. Here we consider two time series of microbubble measurements,
i.e. hitting times, selected from a larger database because of their uniformity and relevant statistics, we will refer to
them in the following as sample (a) and (b). The ﬁrst sample (a) has been taken for a 12 hours long measurement;

it consists of Nb = 24099 bubbles with a mean hitting frequency f = 0.56 sec−1. The second sample, (b), is a record
of 11 hours, Nb = 11194 and f ≃ 0.28 sec−1. There are two main diﬀerences among the experimental conditions in
which the two samples have been recorded, that is the total volume void fractions (α) and the amplitude of the mean
ﬂow and therefore the intensity of turbulence. Case (a) has a void fraction of ≈ 0.3% and (b) has a void fraction
of ≈ 0.1%. Given the small eﬀect produced by the dispersed bubbly phase on the turbulent cascading mechanism,
[14], we consider the discrepancy in α as irrelevant for the velocity spectra. In contrast, the diﬀerence in the forcing
amplitude is more important, because it changes sensibly all the relevant scales of turbulence as summarized in Table
I. In particular, this leads to diﬀerent values for the minimal experimentally detectable scale: ∆rmin ≃ 5η for case
(a) and ∆rmin ≃ 3η for (b), where Taylor hypothesis has been used to convert time to space measurements, i.e.
∆r = τ · U . In the following, results of our analysis will be presented by adopting space units made dimensionless
by the Kolmogorov scale η, we consider this re-scaling more useful for comparison with diﬀerent experiments and
simulations where a mean ﬂow may be absent.

A. Methods

In this section we present the statistical tests we will adopt to quantify the clustering. A ﬁrst way to assess the
presence of preferential concentrations in the experimental records is to compute the probability density function
(pdf) of the distance, ∆r, between couples of successive bubbles. We note that the pair-separation pdf corresponding
to a random and homogeneous distribution follows the exponential form, ρ exp(−ρ∆r), where ρ = f /U is the mean
rate of bubbles per unit length. In general, one expects that for large enough separation-scales the exponential form
of the pdf is recovered. In fact, pairs of successive bubbles with large separations ∆r, larger then any structures in the
ﬂow, are uncorrelated, memory-less, events. However, due to the possible accumulation on small scales the long tail of
the pdf may have an exponential decay rate that is diﬀerent from the global mean, ρ. The tail of the experimentally
measured pdf can be ﬁtted with an exponentially decaying function, A · exp(−ρh∆r), with a rate that we call ρh,
where h stands for homogeneous. In case of small-scale clustering we expect ρh to be smaller than ρ. As an indicator
of the fraction of bubbles accumulated in turbulent structures, we use the coeﬃcient C ≡ 1 − ρh/ρ, whose value varies
in between 0 and 1.

r/(µ2

r)2 − 3, and Skewness excess, S(r) ≡ µ3

A second statistical test is particularly useful to reveal the scales at which the non-homogeneity ﬁrst takes place.
The idea is to compute the coarse-grained central moments of the number of bubbles, on a window of variable
r ≡ h(n − hnir)pir. From them several relevant statistical observables can be derived. We will focus here
length r, µp
on scale dependent Kurtosis, K(r) ≡ µ4
r)3/2. A random spatially
homogeneous distribution of particles with mean rate ρ corresponds to a Poisson distribution of the form, p(n) =
exp(−ρ r)(ρr)n(n!)−1, where r is the length of the spatial window considered and n is the number of events expected
in it. Therefore, once the particle space rate ρ is given, the value of any statistical moments and their combinations
can be derived for the corresponding window length r. Homogeneous and random statistics for instance implies the
functional dependences K(r) = (ρr)−1 and S(r) = (ρr)−1/2 . Furthermore, we note that at the smallest scale, when
r = ∆rmin, we reach the singular limit (shot-noise limit) where for any given space-window we can ﬁnd only 1 or
0 bubbles. Therefore all the statistical moments collapse to the same value. This latter limit, which is by the way
coincident with Poisson statistics, represents our minimal detectable scale. We are interested in departures from the
shot-noise/random-homogeneous behavior for the statistical observables K(r) and S(r).

B. Results

In ﬁgure 2 we show in a Linear-Log plots the computed pdf(∆r) for the two data samples considered. Deviations
from global homogeneity are clear if the shape of the histogram is compared with the solid line representing the pdf
ρ exp(−ρ∆r). These deviations are weakly more marked in case (a), the most turbulent, than case (b). Nevertheless,
one can notice that the pure exponentially decaying behavior, i.e. homogeneity, is recovered from distances of the order

tail in the interval [103, 2 ·103]η, and the inset boxes, where the pdf is compensated by the ﬁt, shows this latter feature.
The evaluation of the coeﬃcient C leads to values for the relative bubbles excess in clusters corresponding to 19 %
for case (a) (Reλ ≃ 206) and 10 % for case (b) (Reλ ≃ 180), conﬁrming the trend of stronger concentration in ﬂows
with stronger turbulence level. In ﬁgure 3 we show the Kurtosis and Skewness behavior, evaluated for the two cases
(a)-(b), in a comparison with the Poissonian dependence. We observe in both cases a clear departure at small scale
from the scaling implied by the global homogeneity, this behavior is then recovered at large scale (& 500η) where the
data points falls roughly parallel to the Poisson line. The departure from the Poisson line, that is noticeable already
at the scales immediately above ∆rmin, is an indication that bubbles form clusters even at the smallest scale we are
able to detect, that is even below 5η for case (a) or 3η for case (b). We observe that for the less turbulent case,
(b), the departure from the homogeneous scaling is less marked. A comparison with synthetic Poisson samples of an
equivalent number of bubbles, that we have tried, shows that although limited, the available statistics is enough to
validate the deviations from the homogeneity discussed so far. Scale dependent deviation from Poisson distribution

is an evidence of the fact that the dispersed microbubbles are trapped within the dynamical vortical structures of
turbulence. Furthermore, we observe that gravity plays a minor role in this dynamics. In fact, as it can be noticed in
Tab. I, on average the bubbles are swept down by the large mean ﬂow, i.e. vT /U ≪ 1. It is mainly the inertia that
drives the bubble accumulation in the ﬂow.

III. SIMULATIONS

Is the picture drawn from experiment also conﬁrmed by present numerical simulations? Despite the many im-
provement in numerical methods for multi-phase ﬂows achieved in recent years, as for instance the reliable class of
front-tracking methods, [20], the only scheme today available for the study of a dispersed multi-phase ﬂow in the con-
large-scale separation, and large number of bubbles is the Eulerian-Lagrangian
ditions of high ﬂuid turbulence, i.e.

approach. According to this scheme the ﬂuid is described by the Navier-Stokes equation. Bubbles are treated as
point-particles with an equation of motion accounting for the eﬀective forces acting on them, namely added mass,
drag, buoyancy, lift and history forces, as already mentioned in the introduction. Our knowledge of these forces, even
in the simpliﬁed case of Reb ∼ O(1), is only approximate. Therefore the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach can only be
considered as a phenomenological method. In this study we assume the limit of negligible air density compared to
water to hold, ρg/ρf → 0, which ﬁxes the inertia term. We use the spherical added mass coeﬃcient, CM = 1/2, drag
coeﬃcient for the steady Stokes ﬂow (Re ≪ 1), CD = 16/Re, buoyancy, the Auton’s expression for the lift force with
lift coeﬃcient CL = 1/2, [21], and ﬁnally we neglect the history force, [22]. The bubble’s velocity equation of motion
we adopt is therefore the following, [23], [24], [25], [15], [16]:

where u and ω are respectively the ﬂuid velocity and vorticity computed at the bubble position. In previous numerical
studies based on the same description of the multi-phase system Mazzitelli et al. [16], [26], pointed out that bubbles
can strongly concentrate in turbulent vortical ﬁlaments: we refer in particular to Figure 1(a) of [26]. How does this
look like from a single point probe measurement? And how does this change at varying the turbulence intensity? To
address these questions, we attempt a numerical test of the two-phase system. The ﬂows is homogenous and isotropic
turbulence in a periodic box, of resolution 1283, seeded approximately with 105 bubbles, corresponding to a void
fraction α = 2.5%. Since previous experimental and numerical studies by van den Berg et al. [14] and Mazzitelli et al.
[15] have revealed that the eﬀect of bubbles on strong unbounded turbulence is relatively weak, our numerical bubbles
are only coupled in one-way mode to the ﬂuid, i.e. bubbles do not aﬀect the ﬂuid phase. The bubble-Reynolds number
Reb is set to unity, the bubble radius is of order η, the Stokes number is St ≪ 1, and the bubble terminal velocity
vT in still water is much smaller than the large scale ﬂow, u′. Therefore, as in the experiment, the role of gravity is
marginal. In Table II we report the characteristics of the simulated ﬂow, they are similar to the ones displayed in
the experiment. We however can not reach the same scale separation as displayed by our turbulence experiments.
Therefore, in order to have a better comparison with the scales of the real world we give, on the bottom panel of
Tab.II, the physical equivalent quantities of our numerics. We note also that in the numerics the Stokes number,
St = τb/τη, which is an indicator of the degree of bubble interaction with turbulence, can not be as low as in the
experiments unless at the price of highly time demanding computations. In fact to correctly resolve the motion of the
bubble the computational time step (dt) shall be always adjusted to satisfy the relation dt ≪ τb, increasing sensibly
the computational needs. For practical reason the Stokes values adopted in our numerics are roughly one order of
magnitude larger than in the experiments, but always much below unity, St ≪ 1. Under this conditions, spatial
visualizations show strong bubble accumulation in nearly one-dimensional elongated structure in correspondence to
high enstrophy regions, identiﬁed as vortex ﬁlaments [26].

To detect bubbles clustering in a similar way to the experiments, we put 128 virtual point-like probes in the ﬂow
and recorded the hitting time of bubbles, giving them a virtual radius, R0. We note that the bubble radius is linked
to the typical bubble response time, τb, via the relation, R0 ≡ (6τbν)
, implying free-slip boundary conditions at
the gas-ﬂuid interface. Another distinction between the experiment and our numerics that we shall mention is on
the mean ﬂow: active in the experiment while intrinsically suppressed in the simulations. In the numerics time is
connected to space displacement by mean of the relation ∆R = ∆t·u′, where, u′, is the root mean square velocity. The
level of turbulence, given the available resolution, has been pushed as high as possible (Reλ ≃ 90) to obtain a better
analogy with the experiment. Furthermore also in the numerics two cases are considered, we vary the amplitude of
the external forcing while we keep the bubble size constant, see again Tab. II.

Case (a’) (top) is the most turbulent. In the inset the same compensated plot as in Fig. 2

These two ﬁgures are compared with the analogous experimental ﬁndings already discussed and shown in ﬁgure 2 and
3 . Some qualitative similarities are striking. First, starting from Fig. 4, we observe that deviations from random
and homogeneous, i.e. pure exponential behavior, are relevant at small scales. This feature is conﬁrmed by the scale
dependent Kurtosis and Skewness of Fig. 5, where departure from the Poisson scaling already starts below η scale.
Second, the most turbulent case is the most clusterized, (a’) (Reλ ≃ 95) more than (b’) (Reλ ≃ 91). The evaluation
of the fraction of clustered bubbles, based on the ﬁt of the pdf(∆r) as in the experiment, gives the value 29% for (a’)
and 37% for (b’). Nevertheless, even if the qualitative behavior of the statistical indicators adopted are the same,
important diﬀerences arise in this comparison and they shall be discussed too. Full homogeneity in the numerics
seems to be recovered at scales of order O(10η), this is not the case in the experiments where we reach O(100η) scales,
furthermore the deviations from Poisson distribution and the fraction of clustered bubbles are deﬁnitely stronger in
the numerics. There is more than one possible interpretation for this mismatch. Here we would like to mention what
we consider more relevant besides the possible incompleteness of the model, on which we have already commented
at the beginning of this section. We ﬁrst note that some known physical eﬀects have been neglected so far: the
ﬂuid-bubble and the bubble-bubble couplings and the associated ﬁnite size eﬀects (in the present conditions bubbles

can overlap!). A second reason can be the diﬀerent degree of bubble interaction with turbulence, a quantity that is
parametrized by the Stokes number St = τb/τη. The estimated St in the experiment is roughly one order of magnitude
smaller than in the simulation, this corresponds to bubbles that react faster to the ﬂuid velocity changes and hence
to bubbles that follow closely the ﬂuid particles and accumulate less. Such a trend is also conﬁrmed by our numerics.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have performed statistical tests in order to detect and characterize the bubble preferential concentration phe-
nomenon from single-point hot-wire anemometer measurements in the bulk of a turbulent channel. We have shown
that our experimental records clearly display bubble clustering. The fraction of bubbles trapped in such structures
is relevant and estimated to be of the order of 10%. The scale-dependent deviations from random homogeneous
distribution, that we associate to typical cluster dimension, extend from the smallest detectable scale, O(η), to scales

in the lower inertial range, O(100η). Accumulation of bubbles is enhanced by increasing the turbulence intensity.
Comparison with present Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations, where point-like bubbles strongly accumulate in vortex
core regions, shows similar qualitative features and trends.

We hope this work will stimulate new dedicated experiments to further quantify the clustering dynamics at changing
turbulence intensity and bubble concentration. For instance, an analysis on the statistics of ﬂuid velocity signal just
before a bubble arrives on the probe could be interesting to determine the inﬂuence of the lift force on the bubble
In fact it is thought that, due to the combined eﬀect of buoyancy and lift, bubbles shall accumulate

preferentially in down-ﬂow sides of vortices, [16]. Unfortunately, a corresponding analysis of our experimental data
has hitherto not been successful, presumably due to ﬂow contaminations by small impurities.

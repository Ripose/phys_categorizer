Abstract

It is well known that in a neutrally-stratiﬁed turbulent ﬂow in a deep constant-
stress layer above a ﬂat surface, the variation of the mean velocity with respect
to the distance from the surface obeys the logarithmic law (the so-called “law-of-
the-wall”). More recently, the same logarithmic law has been found also in the
presence of non ﬂat surfaces. It governs the dynamics of the mean velocity (i.e. all
the smaller scales are averaged out) and involves renormalized eﬀective parameters.
Recent numerical simulations analyzed by the authors of the present Letter show
that a more intrinsic logarithmic shape actually takes place also at smaller scales.
Such a generalized law-of-the-wall involves eﬀective parameters smoothly depending
on the position along the underlying topography. Here, we present wind tunnel
experimental evidence conﬁrming and corroborating this new-found property. New
results and their physical interpretation are also presented and discussed.

In the realm of boundary layer ﬂows over complex topography, much eﬀort has been
devoted in the last few years to investigate both the detailed form of the surface pressure
perturbation arising from the interaction between the shear ﬂow and the underlying to-
pography (see, e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 3]) and its link with the eﬀective parameters describing
the large (asymptotic) scale dynamics (see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5]). The latter regime is selected
by observing the ﬂow far enough from the surface and, furthermore, considering solely the
mean velocity. It is thus clear that with this approach all information on the dynamics
at smaller scale becomes completely lost.

1

Unlike what happens for the large-scale (asymptotic) dynamics, the description and un-
derstanding of statistical properties of ﬂows at ‘intermediate’ scales (a regime which we
refer to as “pre-asymptotic”, following Ref. [6]) seems strongly inadequate. Such regime
actually attracts much attention in various applicative domains ranging from wind en-
gineering (e.g., for the safe design and siting of buildings), environmental sciences (e.g.,
for the simulation of air pollution dispersion) and wind energy exploitation (e.g., for the
selection of areas of enhanced wind speed for the economic siting of wind turbines).
This almost unexplored regime is the main concern of the present Letter. A ﬁrst step in
the understanding of the pre-asymptotic dynamics has been done by the present authors
in a very recent work [6], where the analysis of simulations of Navier-Stokes ﬂow ﬁelds
[4] over two-dimensional sinusoidal topographies has been performed. More precisely, in
the case-studies considered, topography takes a sinusoidal modulation of wavelength λ
(along the x−direction, for the sake of simplicity) and amplitude H, its surface having
an uniform roughness z0 (with z0 << H). Here, the dominant process governing the
dynamics is the interaction between the shear ﬂow and the underlying topography, the
eﬀect of which gives rise to a surface pressure perturbation [2]. Such perturbation has a
depth of the order of H and a downwind phase shift with respect to the topography. The
latter is the cause of a net force on the ﬂow, acting in the opposite direction of the ﬂow
itself: thus, an enhanced (with respect to the case of ﬂat terrain) transfer of momentum
towards the surface takes place.
Far enough from the surface, the averaged (over the periodicity box of size λ) ﬂow will
‘see’ an ‘eﬀective ﬂat surface’ over which the ‘basic’ logarithmic law (the well known
“law-of-the-wall” relative to ﬂows over ﬂat terrain [7]) is restored but now with larger
(again with respect to the ﬂat case) eﬀective parameters ueﬀ
0 [4], on account of the
enhanced ﬂux of momentum towards the surface originated by the aforesaid shear-ﬂow –
topography interaction.
In Ref. [6], we pointed out for the ﬁrst time – as far as we know – that at least in the
analyzed WM93 data-set [4], a generalized law-of-the-wall, is observed:

where U is the velocity ﬁeld, x is the horizontal position, z is the height above the terrain,
and k is the von K´arm`an constant which we will take as 0.4. Notice that the eﬀective
parameters, ueﬀ
0 (x), show a dependence on x at scales of the order of λ (i.e. the
ﬂow ‘sees’ some details of the topography and not only its total cumulative eﬀects). This
is precisely the pre-asymptotic regime already deﬁned in Ref. [6].
In the present Letter, our main goal will be to provide a ﬁrst experimental assessment
conﬁrming and corroborating the scenario outlined in Ref. [6]. In fact, the main trouble
of numerical simulations of Navier–Stokes equations is that the impact on the results of

2

the closure schemes, through which small scale dynamics is accounted for, cannot be fully
controlled [4]. An experimental conﬁrmation is thus desirable.
To start our analysis, we brieﬂy describe the experimental set-up relative to the wind
tunnel experiment performed by Gong et al in Ref. [8]. Details on the description of
the wind tunnel facility and the basic data acquisition and analysis system are given
also in Ref. [9]. The experiment was conducted in the AES (Atmospheric Environment
Service, Toronto, Canada) meteorological wind tunnel, which has a working volume of
2.44 m × 1.83 m × 18.29 m (w× h × l). The wave model consisted of sixteen sinusoidal
waves with wavelength λ ∼ 610 mm and through-to-crest height H ∼ 96.5 mm and was
placed with its leading edge at distance d ∼ 6.1 m downstream from a honeycomb located
at the downstream end of the contraction region. The topography can be thus considered
as a fraction of the ideal topography described by:

h(x, y) = Hsin2

πx
λ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(2)

where y is the perpendicular-to-x-axis direction coordinate.
Two surface roughnesses were considered, corresponding to the natural foam surface
(hereafter “smooth case”) and to a carpet cover (“rough case”), respectively. For the
smooth case, velocity proﬁle measurements gave z0 ∼ 0.03 mm, while for the rough case
z0 ∼ 0.40 mm. The ﬂow was neutrally stratiﬁed and can be considered as a perturbation
to a stationary horizontally homogeneous inﬁnitely deep unidirectional constant-stress-
layer ﬂow above a plane surface of uniform roughness, z0. Thus, this basic ﬂow should
have a logarithmic mean velocity proﬁle, U(z) = (u∗/κ) ln(z/z0). The values of u∗ were
∼ 0.43 m/s and ∼ 0.62 m/s for the smooth and the rough case, respectively. The free-
stream velocity, U0, at approximately 1 m above the ﬂoor of the tunnel, was set to about
10 m/s during the measurements both in the smooth and in the rough case. The bound-
ary layer height, hB, was evaluated to be ∼ 600 mm. The rotation of the ﬂow with the
height, produced in the numerical simulations [4] by the Coriolis force, is obviously not
present in the wind tunnel experiment and thus the ﬂow is parallel to the x-axis at all
elevations.

Measurements taken over the crests along the hills showed that the ﬂow reached an
almost periodic state quite rapidly, after the 3rd or 4th wave. Thus, the perturbed velocity
proﬁles, U(x, z), were measured at selected downstream locations between the 11th and
12th wave crests and a very good agreement between the proﬁles over these two crests
was conﬁrmed. This topography can be thus considered as a good approximation to a
two-dimensional topography whose shape is described by Eq. (2)
In order to compare the numerical simulations analyzed in Ref. [6] with the results from
the wind tunnel experiments here shortly described, we used the same approach as by
Finardi et al. [10] and Canepa et al. [11]. Accordingly, noticing that in both cases here

3

considered U0 ∼ 10 m/s, we have kept the speeds (including the friction velocities, u∗)
unchanged, while the wind tunnel lengths (and times) have been multiplied by λW /λG ∼
1000/0.6096 ∼ 1640, where λW and λG are the wavelengths in the Wood numerical
simulations and in the Gong experiment, respectively. With this change of scale, hB ∼
1000 m and λ ∼ 1000 m in both cases, while the roughness lengths become ∼ 0.05 m
(smooth case) and ∼ 0.66 m (rough case), to be compared with the value of ∼ 0.16 m of
the numerical simulations. The hill height, H, becomes ∼ 158 m, to be compared with
the values 20 m, 100 m and 250 m in the Wood numerical experiments.
The ﬁrst point to emphasize is that logarithmic laws described by (1) are evident also in

Ref. [6]), where typical behaviours for the horizontal wind speed proﬁle U(z) (see Eq. (1);
for the sake of brevity, the dependence on the x-coordinate is omitted in the notation

and for four values of the x-coordinate corresponding to: (a) x = 0 (i.e. h = 0), (b)
x = λ/4 (i.e. h = H/2 upwind), (c) x = λ/2 (i.e. h = H) and (d) x = 3λ/4 (i.e. h = H/2
downwind), respectively. Similar behaviours have been found (but not reported here for
the sake of brevity) also for the smooth case. From this ﬁgure, clean logarithmic region of
the type described by Eq. (1) are evident and both ueﬀ
0 (x) can be measured by
least-square ﬁts. Speciﬁcally, for the four above positions along the hill, we have obtained
the following values of ueﬀ
0 (x): 1.73 m/s, 0.053 m (for h = 0); 1.38 m/s,
0.028 m (for h = H/2 upwind); 0.95 m/s, 0.007 m (for h = H) and 1.27 m/s, 0.022 m
(for h = H/2 downwind), respectively. Such values can be compared with those in the
absence of any hill: u⋆ ∼ 0.62 m/s and z0 ∼ 0.66 m.

0 (x)/z0) have been
ﬁtted with the analytical expression (2), relative to the topographic proﬁle, but with a
shift of λ/2 (i.e. x 7→ x + λ/2 in (2)). More precisely, we suggest the expression:

⋆ (x)/u⋆ − 1 and ln(zeﬀ

y(x) = hyi − Ay [h(x)/H − 1/2]

(3)

⋆ (x)/u⋆ − 1 or ln (zeﬀ

where y(x) stays for either ueﬀ
0 (x)/z0), hyi is the average value of y(x)
in the interval (0, λ) and h(x) ≡ h(x, y) is the topographic shape given in Eq. (2). It
should be also stressed that we have considered ln(zeﬀ
0 (x)/z0) instead of the simpler ratio
zeﬀ
0 (x)/z0, because the former parameter is more similar to the topography shape than
the second one.
It is now interesting to put together the new results here obtained with those of Ref. [6].
This allows to investigate at which degree of accuracy one can express the behaviours
of quantities like the average values, hyi, and amplitudes, Ay, of these sinusoidal shapes
solely in terms of simple geometrical parameters. Simple considerations suggest to look
at the ratio H/λ: this is indeed a rough measure of the hill slope.

The values of hyi are reported in Fig. 3 for both the smooth and the rough case. The

dashed lines (a linear ﬁt in H/λ) are obtained considering only the results of numerical
simulations, while the values from the wind tunnel experiments are reported with their
error bars. These monotonic behaviours are expected on account of the increasing of
the (total) transfer of momentum towards the surface arising for increasing slopes. The
amplitudes Ay are shown in Fig. 4. The dashed lines are a parabolic ﬁt in H/λ and, as for
hyi, they have been obtained by only considering the results of the numerical simulations.

The values from the wind tunnel experiments are again presented in the same ﬁgure.
Curves relative to the amplitudes reach a maximum for H/λ ∼ 0.20, after that start to
decrease. We can argue that two diﬀerent mechanisms exist and act in competition. The
physical key role is played by curvature eﬀects [12], already invoked in Ref. [6] to explain
the presence of minima (maxima) located above the hill top (valley) for both ueﬀ
⋆ (x) and
ln zeﬀ
0 (x). To be more speciﬁc, let us consider the two opposite limits H/λ ≪ 1 and
H/λ ≫ 1, from which we can easily isolate the two competing mechanisms. Concerning
the former limit, we have gentle slopes and it is well known that in this case the ﬂow
closely follows the surface contour. Streamlines are (weakly) curved and, as pointed out
in Ref. [12], energy is transferred towards the large scale components above the hill tops,
while it blows towards the smaller scales above the valleys. The quantity ueﬀ 2
(x), that
is a measure of the energy of turbulence, is thus smaller on the hill top than above the
valley. Let us increase (just a little bit) H/λ. The ﬂow again closely follows the surface
contour but streamlines are now more curved. As pointed out in Ref. [12], energy transfer
thus increases and, as an immediate consequence, the same happens for the diﬀerence
between the maximum and the minimum of ueﬀ
⋆ (x). But this means an augmentation of
its modulation amplitude.
In the second limit H/λ ≫ 1, a further important eﬀect arises due to trapping regions
placed on the downstream hill slopes. It is in fact well known (see, e.g., [13]) that, for
surface slopes large enough, the ﬂow is not able to follow the contour surface and sepa-
rates. In this case, in between two hill crests, the ﬂow is essentially trapped and, roughly
speaking, streamlines are expunged in the wake region. The dynamical consequence is
that the ﬂow streamlines are weakly modulated, and this also happens for the shape of
ueﬀ
⋆ (x). If we now decrease the ratio H/λ, trapping eﬀects reduce and this means that the
wake can penetrate more deeply in the valley, with the consequent increasing of curvature
eﬀects and thus of the ueﬀ
From the inspection of these two limits, it is thus clear that a maximum in the amplitude
should be attained for a certain ﬁnite value of H/λ, i.e. when the two competing mecha-
nisms are balanced.
Being the maximum (minimum) of ln zeﬀ

0 (x).

Comparing the values of both amplitudes and mean values of the eﬀective parameters
extrapolated from the numerical simulations (i.e. from the linear ﬁts in Figs. 3 and 4) and
those from the wind tunnel experiments, we notice that, for the smooth case, experiments
are always compatible (within the error bars) with the numerical simulations. This is
not always the case for the rough case. We remark that u∗ and z0 (relative to the ﬂat
terrain) are closer to the WM93 case studies in the smooth case than in the rough case.
This suggest that the expression of both amplitudes and mean values solely in terms of

7

geometrical quantities like the ratio H/λ is a reasonable approximation for small variations
of the ‘bare’ parameters u∗ and z0. When the range of variability of the latter two
parameters increases, an explicit dependence on them has to be taken into account.

For a better evaluation and understanding of the dependence of hyi and Ay on H/λ,
z0 and u∗, the analysis of more numerical and wind tunnel experiments, and possibly in
nature, is necessary. Nevertheless, the wind tunnel data here considered give a strong
conﬁrmation of the existence of a pre-asymptotic regime characterized by a generalized
law-of-the-wall given by Eq. (1) and pointed out for the ﬁrst time in Ref. [6]. Thus, this
phenomenon appears as a real physical property and not a spurious feature produced by
some of the approximations (e.g. parameterizations of small-scale, unresolved dynamics)
used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations.

We derive a formula for the entropy of two dimensional incompressible inviscid ﬂow,
by determining the volume of the space of vorticity distributions with ﬁxed values for
ω(x)kd2x. This space is approximated by a sequence of spaces
the moments Qk =
of ﬁnite volume, by using a regularization of the system that is geometrically natural
and connected with the theory of random matrices. In taking the limit we get a simple
formula for the entropy of a vortex ﬁeld. We predict vorticity distributions of maximum
entropy with given mean vorticity and enstrophy; also we predict the cylindrically sym-
metric vortex ﬁeld with maximum entropy. This could be an approximate description of
a hurricane.

1. Introduction

Two dimensional inviscid incompressible ﬂow is completely determined by so-
lutions to the Euler equations in the absence of random external forces. Detailed
numerical as well as analogue simulations1 show complex phenomena such as recom-
bination of vortices. Still, the situation is much simpler than in three dimensions.
It appears that energy ﬂows from small scales to large scales so that over long time
intervals the ﬂow becomes smoother. This is the opposite of the behavior observed
in three dimensional hydrodynamics. Thus two dimensional ﬂow is not turbulent in
the same sense as three dimensional ﬂow. Nevertheless, there is suﬃcient complexity
remaining even in two dimensions that a statistical approach is worthwile.

The study of the statistical mechanics of inviscid ﬂow dates back to Onsager2
with some recent revivals3,4. The crucial input into any statistical theory is the
formula for entropy. Previous studies have used various postulates for the entropy
of a vortex ﬁeld ω(x) such as

We will determine the formula for entropy predicted by its microscopic (Boltzmann)
deﬁnition as the logarithm of the volume of the phase space with a ﬁxed value
of the conserved quantities (more precisely, central observables—see below). The

conserved quantities of the Euler equation are the moments Qk =
volume of the phase space is diﬃcult to determine directly because it is inﬁnite
dimensional.

We will determine a formula for entropy by ‘regularizing’ the system; i.e., ap-
proximating it with a ﬁnite dimensional system. The volume of the phase space
is then ﬁnite—indeed the answer is known in the literature on Random Matrix
theory5. The entropy of the original system can then be determined by taking the
limit as the dimension goes to inﬁnity. We establish this way that the formula for
entropy is

where A is the area of the region within which the ﬂow is contained. This is
quite diﬀerent from the postulates used in earlier analyses2,3,4. We then use this
formula to predict the maximum entropy conﬁguration with given mean vorticity
and enstrophy∗—it is the Wigner semi-circular distribution. We predict the vorticity
distribution of an axi-symmetric vortex of maximum entropy.

Polyakov6 has presented another theory of two dimensional turbulence, based
on the group of conformal transformations. Our considerations are in many ways
orthogonal, being based on the group of area preserving transformations rather than
conformal transformations (which preserve instead the angles).

In Section 2 we present an overview of two dimensional hydrodynamics. The
Euler equations are formulated as a hamiltonian dynamical system, in analogy to
the rigid body equations also due to Euler.

In Section 3 we discuss the regularization procedure. We use ideas that have their
origin in quantum ﬁeld theory, but have already been used in the hydrodynamics
literature7.

In Section 4 we reformulate the regularized system in terms of hermitean matri-
ces which allows us to use the ideas from random matrix theory to derive a formula
for entropy in Section 5. In Section 6 we derive the distribution function for vortic-
ity that maximizes entropy for given mean vorticity and enstrophy. And ﬁnally we
predict the axi-symetric vortex ﬁeld of maximum entropy in Section 7.

These are analogous to another system studied by Euler: the equations for the

rigid body given by

where Aab is the inverse of the moment of inertia. The integral operator on the rhs is
analogous to the inverse of moment of inertia. Thus vorticity corresponds to angular
momentum, the stream function to angular velocity and the Laplace operator to
the moment of inertia. The deep reason for this analogy8 is that both systems
describe equations for geodesics on a group manifold. In the case of the rigid body,
aFor three dimensional ﬂow, vorticity is a vector ﬁeld. Inviscid ﬂow without external forces satisﬁes

it is the rotation group with the metric given by the moment of inertia tensor; in
the case of hydrodynamics, it is the group of area preserving diﬀeomorphisms with
the L2-metric. In more physical terms, this analogy can be seen in the hamiltonian
formalism.

Recall that the space of functions on the plane is a Lie algebra, with the Lie

A straightforward calculation shows that this hamiltonian with the above Pois-
son bracket for vorticity indeed gives the equation of motion of two dimensional
hydrodynamics.

This is analogous to the hamiltonian formalism of rigid body mechanics. The
Poisson bracket of the angular momentum (as measured in the co-moving coordi-
nates) arises from the Lie algebra of inﬁnitesimal rotations,

The hamiltonian is the rotational kinetic energy

where A is the inverse of the moment of inertia matrix. Thus, vorticity is analogous
to angular momentum; the Lie algebra of functions on the plane analogous to the
Lie algebra of rotations; and the Green’s function of the Laplace operator analogous
to the inverse of the moment of inertia matrix.

The square of the angular momentum L2 = LaLa is a central function (i.e.,
has zero Poisson bracket with all functions of angular momentum). In particular it
commutes with the hamiltonian and hence is conserved. The phase space of rigid
body mechanics is the sphere on which L2 is constant: this is the ‘symplectic leaf’
of the Poisson algebra.

Analogously, the moments

ωk(x)d2x,

are central functions (hence conserved quantities) in two dimensional hydrodynam-
ics; the phase space of two-dimensional hydrodynamics is the set of all vorticity
ﬁelds with a given set of values of these Qk.

The information in these moments can be packaged into the vorticity distribution

function ρ(λ),

Geometrically, ρ(λ) is the perimeter of the contour curve of vorticity where ω(x) =
λ. This can be written explicitly as

The shape of these curves changes with time but not their perimeter.

In addition to these central functions, there may be additional conserved quan-

tities such as momentum and angular momentum:

L =

(19)

But the presence of a boundary can break translational or rotation invariance,
violating these conservation laws.

In spite of the presence of these inﬁnite number of conservation laws, two dimen-
sional hydrodynamics is far from being integrable: the phase space on which the Qk
are constant is still inﬁnite-dimensional. The crucial step in a statistical approach
is the correct identiﬁcation of entropy. This is ultimately deﬁned by the canonical
structure of the phase space: entropy of a macroscopic conﬁguration is the log of
the volume of the phase space corresponding to it. We would for example like to
determine the volume of the phase space with a given set of values of moments
Qk. However, this is some inﬁnite dimensional subspace of the space of all vorticity
distributions. We need to ﬁnd a way to approximate the phase space by a ﬁnite
dimensional space: a ‘regularization’ or ‘discretization’ of the system. The entropy
can then be determined within this discretized version of the theory and eventually
a limit as the number of degrees of freedom goes to inﬁnity can be taken.

We now describe an elegant discretization7 of two dimensional hydrodynamics
that preserves its symmetries (Lie algebra structure) and conservation laws. We
will see that the problem of determining the entropy of a two dimensional ﬂow can
then be solved using ideas from Random matrix theory due to Wigner.

3. Regularization

It will be convenient to assume that the ﬂow satisﬁes periodic boundary con-
ditions in the plane. Our ﬁnal result for entropy will be the same even if other
boundary conditions are assumed, but the intermediate formulas seem simplest
with periodic boundary conditions:

ω(x1 + L1, x2) = ω(x1, x2), ω(x1, x2 + L2) = ω(x1, x2).

We are still dealing with a system with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom.
At ﬁrst glance, ignoring all except the low momentum modes (i.e., keeping only
< N for some N ) looks like a reasonable ‘regularization’ of the problem:
,

we would lose only information at very small length scales. However, such a naive
truncation that simply ignores large m1, m2 modes would not be consistent:
for
example, the Poisson bracket of two low momentum modes could be a high mo-
mentum mode. We must modify the Poisson brackets so that the Poisson brackets
of the modes we keep form a closed Lie algebra; as N
this modiﬁcation must
dissappear and we must recover the original Lie algebra. Moreover the hamiltonian
must be modiﬁed so that the equations don’t mix high and low momentum modes.
A formalism along these lines is known in the literature7. The essential idea is
to modify the coeﬃcients in the Poisson brackets and hamiltonian so that they are
periodic with period N ; this way the algebra would be closed. There is a choice
that satisﬁes the Jacobi identity, thus preserving the Lie algebra structure:

algebra tend to the original ones; so does the hamiltonian. The Lie algebra we
obtain this way is in fact nothing but that of the Unitary group U (N ), the Lie
algebra of hermitean matrices.
Indeed the discretization procedure above has a
natural interpretation in terms of non-commutative geometry; the Lie algebra is
the algebra of derivations of the algebra of functions on a non-commutative torus.
The constants λ(m) in the hamiltonian above are the eigenvalues of the Laplace
operator. However, we will not need this interpretation in what follows. Non-
commutative geometry plays a deeper role in the three dimensional version of this
theory, which one of us is still developing.

7. Vorticity Distribution in a Cylindrically Symmetric Fluid

As an applicaton of our ideas we determine the maximum entropy conﬁguration
of an axially symmetric ﬂuid trapped between two concentric circles of radii a1 < a2.
The vorticity is a function only of the distance from the origin in the plane.

With axial symmetry, any function ω(r) of the radial distance alone will be a
static solution of the Euler equations. We will seek the answer to the following
question: among all cylindrically symmetric functions with given mean vorticity
and enstropy, which one has the largest entropy? One should expect that a system
subject to many perturbations will eventually settle down to this distribution.

Now, the vortex contours of an axisymmetric vorticity distribution are concentric
circles. We should expect that the vorticity is monotonic with distance in the stable
conﬁguration. The vortex distribution is given by

would be interesting.

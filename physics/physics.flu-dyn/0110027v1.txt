We use silicon strip detectors (originally developed for the CLEO III high energy particle physics
experiment) to measure ﬂuid particle trajectories in turbulence with temporal resolution of up to
70,000 frames per second. This high frame rate allows the Kolmogorov time scale of a turbulent
water ﬂow to be fully resolved for 140
970. Particle trajectories exhibiting accelerations
up to 16,000 m s−2 (40 times the rms value) are routinely observed. The probability density
function of the acceleration is found to have Reynolds number dependent stretched exponential
tails. The moments of the acceleration distribution are calculated. The scaling of the acceleration
component variance with the energy dissipation is found to be consistent with the results for
low Reynolds number direct numerical simulations, and with the K41 based Heisenberg-Yaglom
500. The acceleration ﬂatness is found to increase with Reynolds number,
prediction for Rλ ≥
and to exceed 60 at Rλ = 970. The coupling of the acceleration to the large scale anisotropy is
found to be large at low Reynolds number and to decrease as the Reynolds number increases,
but to persist at all Reynolds numbers measured. The dependence of the acceleration variance
on the size and density of the tracer particles is measured. The autocorrelation function of an
acceleration component is measured, and is found to scale with the Kolmogorov time τη.

1. Introduction

Fluid turbulence may be characterized in terms of variables deﬁned at points ﬁxed in space
(the Eulerian reference frame), or in terms of the trajectories of ﬂuid particles (the Lagrangian
reference frame). This distinction applies both to theoretical formulations of turbulence and to
experimental techniques for characterizing turbulent ﬂows. Although the formulation of ﬂuid
dynamics is generally considered to be more tractable in terms of Eulerian variables, the critical
issues of transport and mixing in turbulence are more directly related to the properties of ﬂuid
trajectories (Shraiman & Siggia 2000; Yeung 2001b; Sawford 2001), and are often addressed us-
ing Lagrangian techniques (Pope 1994). There are also many applications in which the transport
or aggregation of particulate matter in turbulence is important in its own right, such as water
droplet aggregation in clouds (Vaillancourt & Yau 2000) or the industrial production of nanopar-
ticles (Pratsinis & Srinivas 1996).

In a basic sense, data obtained from Lagrangian and Eulerian measurements are complemen-
tary. In the Eulerian frame, one is typically concerned with differences between quantities (ve-
locity component, scalar concentration, etc.) measured for several points separated by a ﬁxed
distance in space. It would be equally interesting to study time differences, however such mea-
surements made within the Eulerian framework are difﬁcult to interpret, since the large scales
of the ﬂow will sweep the turbulence past a ﬁxed detector, causing temporal structure to be en-

tangled with spatial structure. The true temporal structure of turbulence is only revealed when
ﬂuctuations are measured along a particle trajectory, in the Lagrangian frame.

Turbulence has traditionally been studied in the Eulerian frame rather than the Lagrangian
frame for technical reasons. The hot wire anemometer used in conjunction with the Taylor
frozen ﬂow hypothesis provides extremely accurate Eulerian data in turbulent gas ﬂows over
a broad range of Reynolds number, but no comparably effective technique has been available
for Lagrangian measurements. However, as the range of Reynolds number accessible to direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence has expanded, numerical studies of particle trajec-
tories in isotropic turbulence have yielded important insights (Vedula & Yeung 1999; Yeung
2001a; Gotoh & Rogallo 1999; Gotoh & Fukayama 2001). Although very little experimental
data for Lagrangian properties in fully developed turbulence has been available, this is beginning
to change. Basic issues, such as the Richardson law for particle dispersion (Monin & Yaglom
1975), the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction of ﬂuid particle accelerations (Heisenberg 1948; Ya-
glom 1949), and Kolmogorov scaling of temporal velocity differences have remained untested
for many decades. Recent experiments by Ott & Mann (2000), Voth et al. (1998), and Mordant
et al. (2001) have made signiﬁcant progress in addressing each of these but there are still ma-
jor limitations. In particular, limitations in spatial and temporal measurement resolution have
obscured the small scales at large Reynolds number. More complete information about particle
trajectories in real (non-idealized) turbulent ﬂows is needed to guide the development of models
of transport in applications (Pope 1994).

In principle, ﬂuid particle trajectories are easily measured by seeding a turbulent ﬂow with
minute tracer particles and following their three-dimensional motions with an imaging system.
In practice, this is a very challenging task because changes in particle velocity or acceleration
can take place on time scales of order of the Kolmogorov time, τη = (ν/ǫ)1/2 where ν is the
kinematic viscosity and ǫ is the energy dissipation per unit mass. In order to observe universal
scaling behaviour we require that the Reynolds number, deﬁned by Re = uL/ν, where u is the
rms velocity and L is the energy injection scale, approach 105. (This is equivalent to requiring
that the Taylor microscale Reynolds number Rλ = (15Re)1/2 approach 1000.) In a laboratory
10−6 m2 s−3) with convenient energy injection scale (L
water ﬂow (ν
0.1 m) and assuming
10 m2 s−3, which implies τ
ǫ = u3/L we must have ǫ
0.3 ms. In order to measure particle
accelerations, motions which take place over this time scale must be fully resolved.

Although conventional imaging systems based on charge coupled devices (CCD) have been
used for three-dimensional tracking of particles in low Reynolds number ﬂows (Snyder & Lum-
ley 1971; Sato & Yamamoto 1987; Virant & Dracos 1997; Ott & Mann 2000) they do not provide
adequate temporal resolution for use in fully developed turbulence, as speciﬁed above. However,
these requirements may be met by the use of silicon strip detectors as optical imaging elements
in a particle tracking system. The strip detectors used in our experiment were developed to mea-
sure sub-atomic particle tracks in the vertex detector of the CLEO III experiment operating at
the Cornell Electron-Positron Collider (Skubic et al. 1998). When applied to particle tracking
in turbulence each detector measures a one dimensional projection of the image of the tracer
particles. Using a data acquisition system designed speciﬁcally for the turbulence experiment
several detectors may be simultaneously read out at 70,000 frames per second, making it possi-
ble to measure two-dimensional or three-dimensional particle trajectories with very high spatial
and time resolution (Voth et al. 2001; La Porta et al. 2001).

The technical demands of particle tracking in turbulence and the scope of phenomena which
become accessible when these demands are met can best be appreciated by examining one of the
more dramatic particle trajectories recorded with the strip detector particle tracking system. The
three-dimensional trajectory shown in ﬁgure 1 was recorded in a ﬂow between counter-rotating
disks at Rλ = 970 (described below in Section 3) having an rms velocity of approximately

magnitude is represented as the colour of the trajectory, as indicated by the scale.

1 m s−1, a Kolmogorov time τη of approximately 1/3 ms, and a Kolmogorov distance scale η of
20 µm.

The trajectory was recorded at 70,000 frames per second using a pair of strip detectors collect-
ing primary and conjugate charge, as will be described in Section 2 below. The particle enters
the measurement volume near the top right of ﬁgure 1 and appears to be trapped in a vortical
structure. In the third, tightest turn of the helical motion the acceleration of the particle rises
to 16,000 m s−2 within a time interval of 0.5 ms (
1.5τη). During this trajectory the velocity
components of the particle, shown in ﬁgure 2, oscillate wildly, spanning a range considerably
larger than the rms velocity within a Kolmogorov time. The extreme ﬂuctuations in velocity and
acceleration, which occur in time-scales of order of the Kolmogorov time, make great demands
on the particle tracking system.

≈

The trajectory in ﬁgure 1 and 2 is also noteworthy in that it seems to lie outside the charac-
teristic range of the energy cascade. For the ﬁrst part of the trajectory the particle appears to
be caught an a very intense vortical structure. The tightest loop in the helical trajectory of the
particle is about 300 µm in diameter, or about 15 η, which is in the inertial subrange quite close
to the dissipative scale of the turbulence. The period of the motion appears to be less than 1 ms,
of the order of the Kolmogorov time τη. Yet the velocity ﬂuctuations observed in this trajectory
exceed the rms velocity, which would normally be associated with the largest scales of the tur-
bulence (the so called energy-containing range). Events of this nature, which up until now were
experimentally inaccessible, may be interpreted as a manifestation of turbulent intermittency.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the operating principles and
capabilities of the silicon strip detector based particle tracking system are discussed. This in-
cludes discussion of the optical system used to image the tracer particles on the strip detector
(Section 2.2). In Section 3 the turbulent water ﬂow between counter-rotating disks is described,
and characterized using the silicon strip detector. This entails measurement of the velocity statis-
tics and estimate of the energy dissipation from the transverse velocity structure function.

The main results are the investigation of the statistics of particle accelerations in turbulence for
970, given in Section 4. (A brief account of part of this research has previously been
140
published in Nature (La Porta et al. 2001).) In Section 4.1 the probability density function (PDF)
of the acceleration component is measured as a function of Reynolds number and component

the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction. It is found that data is consistent with DNS results at low
500. The ﬂatness
Reynolds number, and with the Heisenberg-Yaglom predicted scaling for Rλ ≥
of the acceleration component is found to be quite large and to increase with Reynolds number,
exceeding 60 at Rλ = 970. The acceleration component autocorrelation function is shown in
Section 4.4. The autocorrelation function is shown to scale with the Kolmogorov time, and to
cross zero at a time of approximately 2.1 τη. Finally, the inﬂuence of particle size and density are
studied in Section 5. It is found that the acceleration of relatively large particles (diameter
5 τη)
can be signiﬁcantly smaller than that of inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid particles, and that, in this experiment,
particle size and not density is primarily responsible for this. However, the 47 µm particles used
for the acceleration measurements differ from ideal ﬂuid particles by only a few percent. Two
appendices are also included. The ﬁrst details the algorithms used for extracting particle tracks
from the strip detector output, and the second compares the results published here with previous
measurements, which were made with a conventional detection system which had much lower
resolution.

2. Particle Tracking System

2.1. Strip Detector

A brief description of the the strip detector tracking system is provided below. It is described in
detail in (Voth et al. 2001).

The silicon strip detector is essentially a large planar photodiode (sensitive area 51 mm
×
25.6 mm) which is segmented into 511 sense strips, as shown in ﬁgure 3. Optical radiation in-
cident on the detector creates electron-hole pairs, and the holes are collected by p-type strips
patterned on the front surface of the n-type detector. Charge is conducted off the detector chip
through metallic leads evaporated onto the surface of the detector which are oriented perpen-
dicular to the sense strips. The positive charge collected by the array of strips gives a one-
dimensional projection of the light intensity incident on the detector, allowing the x coordinate
of a particle that is imaged onto the detector to be measured. However, for certain settings of
the detector bias, electrons appear to become trapped in meta-stable surface states and couple

grey bars superimposed on the dark bars represent metal leads evaporated on to the surface of the detector.
The small circles along the diagonal represent paths that connect sense strips to the leads. Under normal
circumstances, only “primary” charge is collected indicating the x coordinate of light spots incident on the
detector. However, the detector bias may be adjusted so that “conjugate” charge is also detected by the metal

capacitively to the metallic leads. Under these circumstances, negative “conjugate” charge in-
dicates the projection of the intensity on the axis deﬁned by the leads (which is perpendicular
to the axis deﬁned by the sense strips). By distinguishing the primary (positive) and conjugate
(negative) peaks the two-dimensional projection of a particle trajectory may be measured using a
single detector. Positions measured from conjugate charge have greater uncertainty, so for most
of the data presented below, and in particular for the acceleration measurements, primary charge
was used for position measurement.

The 511 strips of each strip detector are connected to an array of four resistor-capacitor (RC)
chips which provide an individual bias resistor and coupling capacitor for each channel. The
output capacitors are connected to an array of four integrated ampliﬁer/multiplexer chips, which
provide a shaper ampliﬁer and sample-and-hold ampliﬁer for each strip. After a frame of data is
latched on the array of sample and hold ampliﬁers, analog multiplexers integrated into the am-
pliﬁer chips output the strip intensities as four 10 Msample/sec waveforms. A detector controller
generates frame-readout triggers for the strip detectors, readout electronics and an acousto-optic
modulator, and may be conﬁgured for readout rates in the range 5 kHz–70 kHz. The acousto-optic
modulator is used to strobe the illumination before the readout of each frame, which is neces-
sary to optimally drive the shaper ampliﬁers. The output waveforms are captured using a pair of
dual-channel digital oscilloscope boards mounted in a PCI bus slave computer. The oscilloscope
boards can store 4,000 frames of data in internal memory, which is subsequently downloaded
into the computer’s main memory. The slave computer performs pedestal subtraction, thresh-
olding, and stores compressed data to a local hard disk concurrently with the acquisition of the
next frame of data. The maximum duration of continuous acquisition ranges from 800 ms at
5 kHz to 58 ms at 70 kHz. The time required to process and store one 4000 frame sequence is
approximately 1 s, and this limits the duty cycle of the acquisition system at high frame rates.

2.2. Optical Imaging System

The optical conﬁguration used to image particles is shown in ﬁgure 5. The illumination beam,
generated by a 6 W continuous wave Argon-Ion laser and gated by the acousto-optic modulator,
is directed through a glass window and passes through the centre of the ﬂow chamber. The beam
1.0mm with
is a TM00 Gaussian mode and a beam expander is used to obtain a spot radius ω
negligible divergence. This beam radius is chosen to so that the beam ﬁlls the ﬁeld of view of
the detector. Acceleration measurements were taken in the conﬁguration shown in ﬁgure 5(a),
in which two strip detectors view a common image and measure two-dimensional coordinates.

Ethernet messaging and provides the user interface for the system.

Some three-dimensional tracks were recorded in the conﬁguration shown in ﬁgure 5(b), in which
two detectors view the volume from different view-ports so that their detection volumes overlap.
The design of the image system, sketched in ﬁgure 5 is determined by the requirement that a
small measurement volume be imaged at high magniﬁcation by optics which are placed outside
the turbulence chamber. These design requirements were met by the two stage imaging system
shown in ﬁgure 6(a). In order to maintain acceptable depth of ﬁeld, the aperture shown after the
ﬁrst imaging lens (L1 in ﬁgure 6) is used to restrict the numerical aperture of the imaging system
to a value of 0.03, giving a spot size
300µm for particles throughout the measurement volume.
As a result, at least three strips were illuminated by each particle image, making it possible to
locate the particle with sub-strip resolution by ﬁtting each peak to a Gaussian function.

≈

Although the magniﬁcation of the optical system deﬁned in ﬁgure 6 is nominally f3/f2, it is
useful to vary the conﬁguration of the system in order to adjust the magniﬁcation and position
of the focal plane. In particular, L1 may be repositioned to change the magniﬁcation of the ﬁrst
stage of the system, and L3 is replaced by a pair of lenses whose separation dependent effective
focal length replaces f3. For the acceleration data presented below, L1 is a compensated doublet
with focal length 15 cm, L2 is a doublet of focal length 3.8 cm and L3 is replaced by a pair of
lenses consisting of a 30 cm focal length plano convex lens and a
50 cm plano concave lens
separated by approximately 10 cm. The detector is placed approximately 25 cm behind the plano
concave lens. The magniﬁcation of the system is approximately 12.8, so that the 100 µm pitch
of the strip detector corresponds to approximately 7.8 µm in the ﬂuid volume, giving a ﬁeld of
view of 2.00 mm
4.00 mm. The effective magniﬁcation of the system is measured to within 2%
using a calibration target that is positioned in the active region at the centre of the ﬂow chamber.
(The variation of the magniﬁcation is less than 1% over the illuminated volume, so it was not
necessary to express the magniﬁcation as a function of depth.)

−

×

For acceleration data, the strip detectors are biased such that conjugate charge is suppressed
allowing them to measure a single coordinate using the primary charge signal. In order to measure
two-dimensional trajectories, a beam-splitter is used to project the same image onto two detectors
(see ﬁgure 5(a)), which are oriented to measure orthogonal coordinates. Because of the 2:1 aspect
ratio of the detector, the ﬁelds of view of the two detectors do not coincide, as shown in ﬁgure 7.

strip detectors which are oriented to measure two orthogonal coordinates. An additional view-port may also
be used to measure the third coordinate. (b) Optical layout for three-dimensional particle measurement. The
apparatus is the same except that imaging optics are present on both ports. In this case strip detectors are
operated with conjugate peaks enabled (see text) so each port has a detector which measures two position
coordinates. on each port.

In this case, the full area of each detector can be used to measure one-dimensional trajectories,
but two-dimensional trajectories can only be measured in the region where the two ﬁelds overlap.
As a result, only half of the 512 strips are available when analyzing two-dimensional trajectories.

2.3. Determination and Characterization of Tracks
Data ﬁles stored by the experiment consist of thresholded intensity data simultaneously acquired
by the two strip detectors. These data ﬁles are passed through several stages of analysis. This
task is similar in principal to that employed in standard particle tracking studies using CCD
cameras, but the algorithms employed must be tailored to the peculiar characteristics of one-
dimensional projection images. A description of the algorithm used for track extraction is given
in Appendix A. Secondary data ﬁles, consisting of lists of tracks measured for each data sequence
are stored for subsequent analysis.

The accuracy of the particle positions is estimated by ﬁtting a straight line to very short track
segments (shorter than τη) and measuring the mean deviation between the data points and the ﬁt.
The deviation is found to depend most signiﬁcantly on the peak height. Figure 9 shows the error
as a function of peak height for a typical run. For extremely weak peaks (maximum intensity <
0.02 V) the error can be of order 1/2 strip, but the the analysis routines are conﬁgured to limit the
0.1 strips. The error for individual trajectories
data to larger intensity, so that the mean error is
can vary depending on focus and aperture, but always remains below 0.2 strips.

≤

One can also consider the mean deviation of the peak from the linear ﬁt as a function of the
position (in strips) modulo 1, shown in ﬁgure 10. The dependence of the mean deviation on the
position indicates a nonlinearity in the interpolation of the peak centres which is smaller than, but
of the same order as the random uncertainty. This nonlinearity is compensated for by subtraction
of the mean deviation from the peak positions before processing of the trajectories.

The kinematic properties of the tracks are measured by polynomial ﬁts (parabolic for acceler-
ation, linear for velocity) to the position vs time data. The ﬁts are made using the standard least
squares algorithm, with the relative weight of each data point proportional to the inverse square
of the estimated error (as a function of peak intensity, ﬁgure 9). The length of track over which
the ﬁt is performed is a complex issue, which is discussed in detail below.

FIGURE 6. A simpliﬁed schematic of the optical system is shown. Plano-convex lens L1 is place just outside
the ﬂuid chamber and is used to image the active volume with 1:1 magniﬁcation. A short focal length lens
L2 is positioned so that its front focal plane (f2) lies at the centre of the image formed by L1. As a result,
point sources in the image are transformed into parallel ray bundles by L2. The bundles are focused by
L3 at its rear focal plane (f3). A beam splitter may be inserted between L2 and L3 to allow the image
to be projected on a second detector, as shown in ﬁgure 5. The magniﬁcation of the system is given by
the ratio of the focal lengths f3/f2. The light collection of the imaging system is controlled by an aperture
−3
placed behind lens L1. (b) The tracer particles are transparent polystyrene spheres with density 1.06 g cm
and diameter 46 µm and are detected via specular reﬂection from the internal and external surfaces. With
◦ and polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the internal reﬂection is much
illumination at 45
stronger than the external reﬂection so that the particle appears as a single point-like source of light.

One of the greatest challenges in the measurement of accurate statistics of Lagrangian vari-
ables is the control of sample biases. From a physical standpoint, one must take care that the
tracer particles uniformly sample the ﬂuid volume and follow the ﬂow ﬁeld. This requires that
the particles be sufﬁciently small and that the density match between the particle and the ﬂuid
be sufﬁciently close. This issue is addressed in Section 5, below. It is also necessary to ensure
that the measurement and analysis procedures do not introduce biases in the measurements of
the particle trajectories. For instance, if one were to make one measurement for each particle that
enters the measurement volume, a distorted velocity distribution would be obtained, since the
rate at which particles enter the measurement volume is itself proportional to the velocity of the
particle (Buchave et al. 1979; Voth et al. 1998). However, the time that a particle will remain in
the measurement volume is inversely proportional to the velocity, and these two factors cancel.
Ideally, one would achieve uniform sampling within the measurement volume by continuously
measuring the kinematic properties of the track from the time that a particle enters the volume
to the time that it exits. In practice this is impossible to achieve because the acceleration and
velocity are measured by ﬁtting to a polynomial function, and so the variables can not be mea-
sured until the particle has been in the measurement volume for a ﬁnite time. Another difﬁculty
is that measurement is not possible when particles cross paths or traverse inoperative pixels. The
strategy employed is to measure the variables as many times as possible along the trajectory,
and make the total statistical weight of these measurements proportional to the total length of
the track. This seems to give the best approximation of uniform sampling of the measurement
volume.

3. Characterization of Flow

The goal of this study is to explore universal characteristics of turbulent ﬂows. However, our
ﬂow deviates signiﬁcantly from the ideal of homogeneity and isotropy. The apparatus used to
generate the turbulent water ﬂow is described in Section 3.1. Standard techniques for character-
izing turbulence using anemometers are not feasible. Therefore, we have used the strip detector
particle tracking system to characterize the ﬂow in terms of standard Eulerian quantities. This

dicular coordinates, where the grey stripes represent the orientation of the charge collecting sense strips.
Because of the 2:1 aspect ratio of the detector, only half of the ﬁeld of each detector overlaps with the ﬁeld
of the other, so that only 256 strips can be used for coincident measurements.

tion 3.2), an estimate of the rate of energy dissipation in terms of the velocity structure functions
(Section 3.3), and a measurement of the anisotropy of the mean velocity ﬁeld at the centre of the
ﬂow (Section 3.4).

3.1. Turbulence Generator

The turbulence is generated in a ﬂow of water between counter-rotating disks in a cylindrical
container (Voth et al. 1998; La Porta et al. 2000), as represented schematically in ﬁgure 11 and
shown in ﬁgure 12. The container, mounted vertically, is 48.3 cm in diameter and 60.5 cm long
with 8 planar windows mounted ﬂush to the surface of the cylinder at equal angles along the mid-
line of the chamber. All physical quantities are deﬁned with reference to a Cartesian coordinate
system in which the z axis corresponds to the axis of symmetry of the cylinder and the x and
y axes correspond to the optical axes of the two imaging systems represented in ﬁgure 5(b).
By symmetry the two transverse coordinates (x and y) are equivalent, and distinct from the
axial coordinate (z). The disk shaped propellers are open-ended cylinders 20 cm in diameter and
4.3 cm deep with twelve internally mounted radial vanes. The propellers are spaced 33 cm apart
and are each driven by 0.9 kW computer controlled controlled dc motors that are coupled to the
propellers with variable speed reducers. A smaller cylindrical tube surrounds each propeller and
stationary radial vanes between this inner cylinder and the container wall have been installed to
inhibit large scale rotation of the ﬂow. For the studies described below, the propeller rotation rate
is varied from 0.15 Hz to 7.0 Hz. The lower limit is set by the motors and speed reducers and
the higher limit is set by the temporal resolution of the detector. (The detectors are not able to
adequately resolve the Kolmogorov time at the maximum propeller speed of 9 Hz.)

The averaged ﬂow produced by the propellers can be interpreted as a superposition of two
basic components, a pumping mode and a shearing mode. Centrifugal pumping by the propellers
produces the ﬂow represented schematically in ﬁgure 11(a). The resulting mean strain ﬁeld at
the centre of the chamber (represented by the arrows in ﬁgure 11(a)) tends to enhance the axial
component of the vorticity. In addition, ﬂuid near the top and bottom of the cylinder tends to
rotate collectively with the counter-rotating propellers, creating a shear layer around the edge of
the ﬂow midway between the propellers, as represented in ﬁgure 11(b). Particle accelerations are
measured in a 4 mm3 volume at the centre of the ﬂow chamber. Quantitative measures of the

3.2. Measurement of the Velocity Fluctuations

Velocity statistics may be obtained from analysis of matched trajectories obtained with the appa-
ratus in its standard conﬁguration, shown in ﬁgure 5(a). As mentioned above, in order to obtain a
correct estimate of the rms velocity, it is necessary to take care to sample trajectories uniformly
by insuring they are continuously sampled as long as they remain in the measurement volume.
The PDF of the velocity is shown for linear and log scales in ﬁgure 13. It is evident that the stan-
dard deviation of the transverse component exceeds that of the axial component by about 50%.
The distributions for both components are approximately Gaussian; the ﬂatness is 2.8 for the ax-
ial and 3.2 for the longitudinal component. These ﬂatness values are independent of the propeller
rotation frequency (Noullez et al. 1997). It may be noted that there is a small dip near zero veloc-
ity in the axial velocity component PDF. This occurs because the light sensitivity of the detector
decreases when a peak remains on the same pixel for consecutive frames. (This is due to an inef-
ﬁciency in the shaping ampliﬁers used for this detector.) As a result, the measurement volume is
effectively smaller for trajectories with near-zero velocity, causing a measurement bias. It should
be noted that measurement biases depend mostly on the velocity and do not affect acceleration
measurements, except to the extent that the acceleration and velocity are correlated.

The scaling of the rms velocity with propeller rotation frequency is shown in ﬁgure 14. The ex-
pected linear dependence on the frequency is observed for both components, which is consistent
with the assumption that the nature of the large scale ﬂow is independent of the stirring velocity
over the range of Reynolds number studied. The inset shows that the deviation from the linear
scaling law does not exceed a few percent. This deviation is most pronounced at low propeller
speeds, perhaps indicating that the turbulence is not “fully developed” at the lower end of the
Reynolds number range.

The ratio of the rms transverse velocity to the rms axial velocity is shown in ﬁgure 15. The
ratio varies only a few percent over the full range of propeller speeds, again indicating that the
large scale structure of the ﬂow does not change as the Reynolds number is varied.

3.3. Energy Dissipation

In order to compare results with Kolmogorov scaling predictions, it is essential to measure the
energy dissipation rate ǫ, since all statistical quantities are assumed to depend on this quantity
and upon the kinematic viscosity ν. The energy dissipation ǫ is given by

where sij is the ﬂuctuating rate of strain tensor, deﬁned by

is a component of the velocity ﬂuctuation (Pope 2000). Unfortunately
where ui = Ui − h
Lagrangian particle tracking does not allow us to measure velocity gradients, so a direct mea-
surement of the energy dissipation is not possible.

Uii

There are several possible indirect methods for measuring the energy dissipation from particle
tracking data (Ott & Mann 2000). The most accessible method requires measurement of second
(or third) order velocity structure functions. The velocity structure functions are the moments of
the velocity differences between two points separated by a ﬁxed difference. The longitudinal and
transverse structure functions are calculated from velocity components parallel to and perpendic-
ular to the line separating the two points, respectively. From the second order structure functions,
the energy dissipation can be obtained by comparison with the K41 scaling relations,

DLL = C2(ǫr)2/3

where L and N designate longitudinal and transverse, respectively, and the separation r is as-
sumed to be within the inertial subrange. C2 is an approximately universal constant that has been
determined empirically (Monin & Yaglom 1975; Pope 2000).

(3.4)

All of these structure functions can be calculated from three-dimensional Lagrangian trajec-
tory data by simultaneously measuring the velocities of pairs of particles. However, the particle
tracking system used in this experiment is currently not capable of three-dimensional tracking in
a volume which would encompass inertial range particle separations due to power limitations of
the Argon-Ion laser used for illumination. To overcome this, we have developed a technique for
measuring the transverse second order velocity structure function using two-dimensional particle
tracking in conjunction with a light sheet.

The structure function measurements are performed using the conﬁguration shown in ﬁg-
ure 16. There are several signiﬁcant differences between this conﬁguration and the standard
conﬁguration used for single particle acceleration and velocity measurements. The magniﬁca-
500η), which allows inertial
tion has been reduced to 2.89, giving a ﬁeld of view of 17.7 mm (
range particle separations to be observed. The optical system is schematically similar to ﬁgure 5,
except that the beam-splitter is omitted and a single detector is used to measure tracks. The bias
of the detector is set so that conjugate peaks are enabled and two-dimensional trajectories can be
obtained from the single detector output, as discussed in Section 2.1 above. In order to maintain
adequate illumination intensity over such a large ﬁeld of view, the illumination beam is conﬁg-
ured as a light sheet approximately 0.1 mm thick and 10 mm wide. The light sheet was created
using a standard Galilean telescope to expand the beam to a large TM00 mode, then a second
cylindrical telescope to compress the horizontal axis and create an elliptical mode. The measure-
ment would be simpler in principle if the light sheet were parallel to the image plane, but in prac-
tice it must be oriented at 45◦ with respect to the optical axis in order to obtain sufﬁciently strong
light scattering from the particles. The data obtained from this conﬁguration consists mostly of
short tracks which are created as the particles pass through the light sheet. The depth of the light
sheet is chosen so that tracks have sufﬁcient length for an accurate velocity measurement to be
made.

Velocity structure functions are measured as a function of r by calculating velocity differences
for all coincident pairs of particles and compiling statistics under the condition that the separation
distance lies within an adjustable range. Such a pair of particles will appear to the detector as
shown in ﬁgure 16(b), and it is possible to measure two velocity components for each particle
and two components of the particle separation vector. However, as illustrated in ﬁgure 16(a), the
separation vector does not lie in the same plane as the velocity components. Using the coordinate
system deﬁned in ﬁgure 16 the coordinates x and z are measured explicitly and we may assume
that y
x. The velocities are determined by tracking the particle for the short time that it
remains within the ﬁnite thickness of the light sheet, and gives the projection of the velocity on
the imaging plane. We therefore measure the components ux and uz, but uy is unknown.

Using this geometry, it is not possible to measure the longitudinal structure function because it
is in general not possible to measure a velocity component along the separation vector. However,
it is always possible to measure one of the velocity components perpendicular to the separation
vector. To ﬁnd the measurable transverse velocity component, we make use of the fact that this
component must be perpendicular to both the separation vector r12 and to the vector normal to
the image plane (ˆy). Such a vector may be constructed by taking the cross product of r12 and y.

below) The results of the matching are shown in ﬁgure 17(c). The scaling of DNN with r is
shown in ﬁgure 18. Both exhibit the expected r2/3 scaling over a substantial range. The scaling
range is limited at small r because particles are too close together to be well localized by the light
sheet and at large r because their separation is approaching the integral length scale. The energy
dissipation rates obtained from the ﬁts in ﬁgure 18 are shown in Table 1, and and are consistent
with the expected ǫ = ˜u3/L scaling with L = 7.1 cm. Once the energy dissipation has been
determined, it is possible to calculate the Taylor microscale, λ = (15ν ˜u2/ǫ)1/2 and the Taylor

The optical conﬁguration used for the dissipation measurements is also useful for investigation of
the structure of the large scale ﬂow near the centre of the apparatus. Due to the symmetry at the
centre of the ﬂow, the off-diagonal elements of the mean rate of strain tensor ∂Ui
are zero, and

4. Results: Particle Acceleration Measurements

The primary subject of this paper is the study of ﬂuid particle accelerations in fully devel-
oped turbulence. In contrast to the ﬂuid particle velocity, which is the same quantity that would
be measured by a ﬁxed probe at the same location, the particle acceleration can only be mea-

substantive derivative of the velocity

In order to determine a+ from Eulerian measurements, it would be necessary to know ∂u/∂t as
u at a point in space (which is possible in DNS but not in experiments). In terms of
well u and
the ﬂuid particle acceleration, the Navier–Stokes equation is

where P is the pressure and ρ is the ﬂuid density. In fully developed turbulence, the viscous term
is small compared with the pressure gradient term, so a measurement of a+ gives information
about the pressure gradient, which is difﬁcult to measure experimentally.

Measurements of the acceleration require the lowest possible position error, and were made ex-
clusively from primary charge readout (rather than from less accurate conjugate charge readout).
Accelerations were measured from two-dimensional trajectories recorded in the conﬁguration
illustrated in ﬁgure 5(a). Accelerations are therefore known in the x-z plane, giving one axial
and one transverse component. (Due to symmetry, the statistical properties of the unmeasured y
coordinate are expected to be identical to those of the x coordinate.)

4.1. Acceleration Distribution

The PDF of the x (transverse) component of the acceleration is shown on linear and logarithmic
scales for several values of Rλ in ﬁgure 19. It is found that the distributions have a stretched
exponential form for all measured values of Rλ, but that the extension of the tails increases with
Rλ. The distributions are plotted for ﬁts to a ﬁnite time interval τf of 0.75τη. Although there is
no qualitative change in the distribution as the ﬁt time is varied over a range 0.5τη < τf < 2τη,
the moments of the distribution tend to increase as the τf is reduced. Estimates of the variance

and ﬂatness of the acceleration distribution (
i i

be obtained by measuring these quantities as a function of τf and extrapolating to zero, as will
be described in Section 4.2 below. However, on the basis of ﬁgure 19 it is obvious that the tails
extend far beyond those of a Gaussian distribution of the same variance and that the ﬂatness of the
acceleration is very large (> 40, compared with 3 for a Gaussian). This result is consistent with
the large pressure gradient ﬂatness values measured at low Reynolds numbers in DNS(Vedula &
Yeung 1999).

The extent to which the anisotropy of the ﬂow affects the acceleration PDF is illustrated in
ﬁgure 21. The plot shows the PDF’s for ax and az at Rλ = 970. Comparison with ﬁgure 13
shows that the acceleration is much less anisotropic than the velocity. The small difference in the
variances of ax and az will be discussed below in Section 4.2.

4.2. Acceleration Variance

The variance of particle accelerations in a turbulent ﬂow was ﬁrst predicted on the basis of the
1941 scaling theory of Kolmogorov (Kolmogorov 1941b,a) by Heisenberg and Yaglom (Heisen-
berg 1948; Yaglom 1949). The variance of the acceleration components is given by

= a0ǫ3/2ν

−1/2δij

aiaji
h

where a0 is predicted to be a universal constant which is approximately 1 in a model assuming
Gaussian ﬂuctuations (Heisenberg 1948). The form of this scaling law can be deduced from the
assumption that the acceleration is a dissipation scale quantity, and must be determined only by
ǫ and ν.

Deviations from the Heisenberg-Yaglom scaling law are expected to arise from turbulent in-

termittency. Using the reﬁned similarity theory, equation 4.4 is replaced with

(or ǫ1/12, using equation 3.8 and assuming constant L and ν). This is equivalent to an overall
scaling of the acceleration variance with ǫ19/12, which is a relatively small deviation from the
Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction of ǫ3/2.

In principal, the acceleration variance may be calculated by taking the second moment of the
distributions shown in ﬁgure 19. However, in order to calculate the particle accelerations the
track must be ﬁt over a ﬁnite time, and the moments of the distribution depend on this ﬁt time
interval. The issue is illustrated in ﬁgure 22, which shows a typical particle trajectory. The raw
trajectory appears to be straight, but when the mean velocity is subtracted off, the particle is seen
to be undergoing a small time varying acceleration, which causes it to deviate from a straight
trajectory by a distance corresponding to a few strips on the detector. The acceleration of this
track is approximately 90 m s−2, which is about one quarter of the rms acceleration—a typical
value. Clearly the correct acceleration will be measured from this track only if a parabolic ﬁt is
made over an appropriate time interval. The ﬁt over 150 frames does not conform to the trajectory
and underestimates the acceleration. The ﬁt over 5 frames conforms to the position measurement
errors and dramatically overestimates the acceleration. The ﬁt over 40 frames (1.8 τη) appears to
conform to this particular trajectory.

Ideally, we would like to ﬁx the ﬁt interval at a value where the noise is adequately aver-
aged and yet the parabolic ﬁts are able to conform to all of the particle trajectories. Figure 23
shows the normalized variance of the velocity distribution as a function of the ﬁt interval τf , and
demonstrates that no value of τf exists which satisﬁes this criteria, since there is no range of τf

The fact that the onset of position uncertainty occurs at a value of τf where the ﬁts fail to fully

any given track. However, we can separate the two effects by making use of the fact that the two
contributions to the acceleration variance have very different scaling with τf . The procedure we
use is to ﬁt the measured a0 (the normalized acceleration variance) to the function

f (τ ) = Aτ B + C exp(Dτ + Eτ 2),

(4.7)

where A, B, C, D and E are ﬁt parameters. The power law term represents the contribution
from the position noise and the exponential term represents the contribution of the turbulence to
the acceleration variance. (The τ 2 term is added to model the slight deviation from exponential
dependence observed at large τf .) The best estimate of a0 is then obtained by evaluating the
0, so that a0 = C. It is known that this extrapolation
exponential term in the limit where τf →
must overestimate the value of a0 because the slope of the a0 vs τf curve must go to zero at
τf = 0 since the tracks are differentiable. A simulation of the detection process, described in
240, which is comparable to
Section 4.5 below, indicates that this overestimate is 10% at Rλ ≈
the random measurement error. All normalized acceleration variance data presented is rescaled
to correct for this overestimation. This correction depends on the assumption that the dependence
of the measured value of a0 on (τf /τη) has a universal form for small τf .

The procedure described above was used to calculate the acceleration variance for x and z
components of the acceleration for all values of the Reynolds number. Figures 24 (a) and (b)
show a0 as a function of τf for the x and z components of the acceleration, respectively. The
maximum value of τf for which the acceleration variance can be calculated is determined by the
length of time the particles remain in view. This is estimated using the sweeping time τs, which
is the length of time a particle moving at the rms velocity would remain in the detection volume
(tabulated in Table 3.4). For purposes of ﬁtting to equation 4.7 the range of each a0 curve in
ﬁgure 24 was limited at low τf to the value where the power law term contributes an order of
magnitude more than the exponential term, and at high τf to 1.15τs.

Certain conclusions may be drawn from ﬁgure 24. The curves for the three high Reynolds
number runs collapse onto a single curve, indicating that the scaling of the acceleration with
time is well approximated by K41 scaling. At low Reynolds numbers, the slopes of the curves
and their extrapolations to τf = 0 fail to collapse, indicating that K41 scaling has broken down.
However, the interpretation is somewhat more complex because the measurement process brings
an additional time scale into play. As the Reynolds number is reduced, the ratio of the residence
time of the particles τs to the Kolmogorov time τη becomes smaller. If there is any correlation
between residence time and acceleration, then this implies that similarity can not be achieved by
rescaling the time axis with τη. By varying the size of the measurement volume (and hence the

(4.8)

(From equation 4.4, using ǫ = ˜u3/L), is observed over nearly 7 orders of magnitude in acceler-
ation variance, or nearly 2 orders of magnitude in velocity. The scaling of a0 with Rλ is plotted
in ﬁgure 26 and (tabulated in Table 4.2). In this plot, a constant value of a0 would indicate
Heisenberg-Yaglom scaling. As Rλ is decreased below 500 the value of a0 decreases substan-
tially showing a small but signiﬁcant departure from universal scaling. The dependence of a0
on Rλ in this regime seems to be qualitatively consistent with DNS results. It is not surprising
that DNS and experimental results do not match exactly at small Reynolds number, since in this
range the acceleration is not decoupled from the large scales of the ﬂow. The DNS results were
obtained for isotropic turbulence with periodic boundary conditions, which differs markedly from
the anisotropically forced turbulence between counter-rotating disks used in the experiment. At
500) a0 appears to be independent of Rλ, which is consistent with
high Reynolds number (Rλ ≥
Heisenberg-Yaglom scaling. Due to experimental uncertainties, very weak deviations such as the
Rλ

0.135 prediction of the Borgas multi-fractal model cannot be ruled out by this data.
Please note that it has been shown that the mean squared pressure gradient in a turbulent
ﬂow—and therefore the mean squared acceleration, and a0— is closely related to the fourth
order velocity structure functions and to the inertial range ﬂatness factor (Hill & Wilczak 1995).
This would indicate that the a0 vs Rλ curve in ﬁgure 26 could be compared with the ﬂatness
factor (F ) vs Rλ curve reported by Belin et. al. in another experiment involving a ﬂow between

counter-rotating disks (Belin et al. 1997). Some similarity is evident, despite the fact that the
ﬂow conﬁgurations are quite different (Hill 2000).

It is also evident that larger a0 values are obtained for the transverse component than for the
axial component of the acceleration, and that the level of anisotropy decreases as the Reynolds
number is increased. The anisotropy of the acceleration variance is best illustrated by calculating
the ratio (a0)x/(a0)z as a function of Rλ, as shown in ﬁgure 27. At the lowest Reynolds number
of 140, (a0)x/(a0)y = 1.52, indicating that the ratio of the standard deviations of the acceler-
ation components is 1.23. As the Reynolds number is increased to 970, the level of anisotropy
decreases to a very small value. This observation is consistent with recent experimental results
which indicate that anisotropy persists to high Reynolds numbers (Kurien & Sreenivasan 2000;
Shen & Warhaft 2000)

It is also informative to compare ﬁgure 27 with the inset to ﬁgure 14, which shows the ratio of
the standard deviations of the velocity components. On the one hand, the particle velocities are
associated mainly with the large scales and the level of anisotropy is large and independent of
Reynolds number, as expected. On the other hand, the particle accelerations come mainly from
the dissipation range scales. As expected, the level of anisotropy is smaller than for the velocity,
and decreases as the Reynolds number is increased.

It is also interesting to quantify the degree of intermittency of the acceleration by calculating the
2) as a function of Reynolds number. In this case, one encounters
acceleration ﬂatness (
the same difﬁculty as for the variance; the ﬂatness varies as a function of the interval over which
the acceleration is calculated. One must also confront the added difﬁculty that the tails of the
acceleration distribution are so long that prohibitively large data samples would be needed to
deﬁnitively converge the fourth moment, as illustrated in ﬁgure 20 above. In view of ﬁgure 20, it
seems possible that the unconverged tails of the acceleration distribution could make substantial
contributions to the fourth moment. In addition, the ability of the tracer particles to fully follow
rare violent events which contribute most to the ﬂatness has not been fully established. Therefore,
we can only set lower bounds to the ﬂatness.

The ﬂatness for the transverse component of the acceleration is shown as a function of ﬁt time
in ﬁgure 28. An increasing trend is evident as τf decreases, but the dependence on τf is more
difﬁcult to deﬁne than in the analogous curves for the acceleration variance (ﬁgure 24). We have

not found it possible to make a formal extrapolation for τf →
the ﬂatness at a value of τf slightly above the onset of power-law position uncertainty we can
compile a plot of lower bounds on the acceleration ﬂatness, shown in ﬁgure 29. The ﬂatness is

found to be at least 25 at the lowest Reynolds numbers studied and the lower bound increases to
approximately 60 as the Reynolds number is increased.

These large ﬂatness values indicate that the acceleration is more intermittent than the other
small scale quantities in turbulence. For example, at Rλ = 200, the longitudinal velocity deriva-
tive ﬂatness is 6.0 (Vanatta & Antonia 1980), and the scalar gradient ﬂatness is 17 (Shen &
Warhaft 2000), while the acceleration ﬂatness in both experiments and simulation (Vedula &
Yeung 1999) is approximately 30.

τ , end effects can be signiﬁcant;

samples and can differ slightly, particularly at large τ .
(cid:10)
The acceleration autocorrelation is shown for Rλ = 970 and Rλ = 690 in ﬁgure 30. In the
main graph the time axis is normalized by the Kolmogorov time τη for each curve, and in the inset
the unnormalized time axis is in units of seconds. The Kolmogorov time is proportional to ˜u−3/2
and changes by a factor of 2√2 between the two values of Rλ studied. The data reproduces
this scaling to an accuracy of a few percent. Calculations of the acceleration autocorrelation
function in direct numerical simulation of turbulence at Rλ = 140 indicate that it crosses zero at
2.2τη (Yeung 1997). In our experiment we see the zero crossing at 2.1τη at Rλ = 970 and 3τη at
Rλ = 690. The data collapse shown in ﬁgure 30 may be regarded as an independent conﬁrmation
of the measurement of the energy dissipation, described above in Section 3.3.

the particle remains in view after a time interval τ has elapsed, however, particles with large ac-
celerations are less likely to remain in view than particles with small accelerations. The ensemble

of measurements contributing to autocorrelation function at τ = 5τη have a standard deviation
that is a factor of 0.7 smaller than that of the unconditional acceleration variance, indicating that
the bias towards low acceleration events is appreciable. To make a deﬁnitive study of the acceler-
ation autocorrelation, and particularly to obtain results at low Reynolds number, a more powerful
laser which can illuminate a larger measurement volume will be required.

4.5. Simulation of Detection process.

As discussed before, measurements of Lagrangian statistics are complicated by the fact that all
statistics are implicitly conditional on the event being successfully measured. For measurements
of acceleration, the particle must remain in view for a sufﬁcient time for its acceleration to be
determined, which may introduce biases due to measurement volume effects. The extrapolation
to zero ﬁt time further complicates the matter, because there are two effects which may affect
the measured acceleration variance as the ﬁt interval is varied. As ﬁt interval is decreased, the
accelerations measured for particular trajectories will increase because there is less coarse grain-
ing over turbulent ﬂuctuations and noise. In addition, as the ﬁt interval is decreased the sampling
of trajectories becomes inclusive because the particles need not remain in view for as long an
interval.

To determine how the extrapolation to zero ﬁt time is related to the true acceleration variance,
we used a simulation of the detection process. The simulation is based on three dimensional
particle trajectory data from Vedula and Yeung’s DNS simulation (Vedula & Yeung 1999) at
Rλ = 240, which is known to have a0 = 3.44. These trajectories were dimensionalized using the
viscosity of water and the rate of energy dissipation which would be needed to produce the same
Reynolds number in our apparatus. These scaled trajectories were used as input to a computer
model which simulated the illumination of the particles and the imaging of our measurement
volume onto the strip detectors, including diffraction and defocusing of the imaging system.
The computer model also simulated charge collection by the strip detector, including correlated
and uncorrelated noise, charge diffusion, and inoperative pixels. The intensities produced by the
simulation were then run through the real-time thresholding and compression algorithms used in
the experiment, and were subsequently processed by the same data processing algorithms used
for actual experimental data.

The measurement of a0 as a function of normalized ﬁt interval is shown in ﬁgure 31 (which
may be compared with ﬁgure 23, above). The exponential dependence on τf is reproduced for
0 gives
large τf , as is the power law dependence for small τf . The extrapolation for τf →
a value of 3.80. This value is 10% higher than the value of 3.44 which was measured directly
from the simulation (Vedula & Yeung 1999). All normalized acceleration variance measurements
presented in this paper have been rescaled to correct for this overestimation.

5. Effect of Finite Particle Size on Particle Accelerations

An important question which must be considered is the extent to which the polystyrene tracer
particles are equivalent to ideal ﬂuid particles. In order to address this question, we have repeated
our acceleration measurements using tracer particles with a range of particle diameters and ﬂuid
densities. Not only are these measurements essential to validate the Lagrangian measurements,
but the data for large particle sizes offers a new perspective on the motion of ﬁnite size particles
in turbulence.

Phenomenologically, we can identify two mechanisms by which a discrepancy between statis-
tics of tracer particle trajectories and ﬂuid particle trajectories could arise. (1) It is possible that
the tracer particle’s density is different from that of the ﬂuid, so that it experiences an acceler-
ation that is different than the acceleration that would be experienced by a ﬂuid particle in the
same location. We call this the density dependent effect. (2) It is possible that the tracer particle’s
size is large enough that the unperturbed ﬂow would change signiﬁcantly over the volume of the
particle. Since this effect remains even when the tracers are density matched, we call this the
density independent effect. The dimensionless numbers that measure these effects are the ratio
of the particle to ﬂuid density, ρp/ρf , and the ratio of the particle diameter to the smallest length
scale in the ﬂow, d/η. A commonly used parameter is the ratio of the Stokes time (d2ρp/νρf ) to
the Kolmogorov time (η2/ν) which is the combination of the size and density parameters.

Particle motion in ﬂuid ﬂows has been extensively studied both as a fundamental ﬂuid dynam-
ics topic (Basset 1888; Corrsin & Lumley 1956; Maxey & Riley 1983) and in order to validate
measurement techniques that rely on tracer particles (Buchave et al. 1979). Most of the work in
this area has focused on the dynamics of particles when the density independent effect is negligi-
ble. Not only is this regime amenable to exact theoretical modelling, but it also is a good approx-
imation for the tracers used in many particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler anemometry
experiments. In these experiments, it is desirable to have the spacing between particles less than
or equal to the size of the smallest ﬂow structures, so the particle size must be much smaller than
the smallest structures.

In order to determine the effects of ﬁnite particle size on the acceleration measurements, we
repeated the measurements at Rλ = 970 using particles of diameters between 26 µm and 450 µm
( 1.44 η and 26 η). The Stokes times for these particles ranges from 0.67 ms to 216 ms, which
should be compared to the Kolmogorov time of 0.32 ms. We also measured acceleration of
450 µm particles in NaCl solutions with densities between 1.00 g cm−3 and 1.11 g cm−3. Since
the particle density is 1.06 g cm−3, this range of densities encompasses both negative and positive
particle buoyancy.

acceleration data taken with pure water at Rλ = 970. A 70% decrease is seen in the measured
acceleration variance between the smallest and largest particles used.

The dependence of the particle acceleration on the density mismatch is shown in ﬁgure 33,
where a0 is plotted as a function of relative density for 450 µm diameter particles at Rλ = 970.
In this case, the density of the ﬂuid is varied by the addition of NaCl, and the values of a0
are corrected for the slight change in kinematic viscosity which occurs as the density is varied.
The data for pure water appears at effective particle density ρeﬀ = 1.06, and reﬂects the strong
underestimate of particle accelerations with large dense particles. If the suppression of a0 were
due to density mismatch, the effect would reverse in the case where the particles are lighter
than the ﬂuid they displace, and the a0 values would exceed the small particle limit. The data
at ρeﬀ = 0.96 in ﬁgure 33 (taken at high salt concentration) shows that although a0 increases
somewhat, it still remains far below the small-particle limit of 6. This data demonstrates that
,in our experiment, the effective coarse graining of the acceleration by the ﬁnite size particles is
more important than the differential buoyancy due to the density mismatch in our measurements.
A simple model based on the K41 phenomenology can be used to predict the scaling of the
acceleration with particle size in this regime where density mismatch is not important. We as-
sume that the effect of ﬁnite particle size is that only ﬂow structures larger than the particle size
contribute to the acceleration. This means that the scaling of the acceleration variance can be
ǫ3/2ν−1/2, and replacing the viscosity with the value that
determined by starting with, < a2
x >
ǫ1/3d4/3. Consequently,
would make the Kolmogorov scale equal to the particle diameter, ν
the acceleration variance should scale as d−2/3 for large particle sizes. We expect that below
some particle size this scaling is no longer adhered to, and the acceleration becomes independant
of particle size. The solid line in ﬁgure 32 shows the d−2/3 scaling. There is not enough data to
conﬁrm this theory, but the data is consistent with this scaling. For large particle size, the data
can be interpreted as following the d−2/3 scaling, and for particle size less than 100 µm (5 η)
there is a turn over to the acceleration being independent of particle size.

∼

To provide an upper limit on the possible deviation of tracer particle acceleration from that
of ﬂuid particles, we note that the dependence of a0 on particle diameter in ﬁgure 32 could be
interpreted as being roughly linear. An extrapolation of the linear dependence to zero particle
size indicates that the acceleration variance of the 47 µm particles used for the acceleration
measurements reported above is within 7% of that of ﬂuid particles. This is really a worst case
scenario, since the values obtained for 26 µm and 46 µm particles are indistinguishable within

experimental uncertainties, and it is expected that the particle size dependence has zero slope at
the origin. Note that this data is at the largest Reynolds number reported in this paper, and the
particle size dependence will be weaker at lower Reynolds numbers. We conclude that the 46 µm
particles are small enough to measure the acceleration variance at the 10% accuracy which we
have reported.

6. Conclusion

We have reported high resolution measurements of the Lagrangian properties of a high Reynolds
number turbulent ﬂow. The particle tracking system, based on the CLEO III silicon strip detector,
is able to measure positions with spatial resolution of 0.5 µm (1/40 of the Kolmogorov distance,
or 1/6400 of the ﬁeld of view) and temporal resolution of 14 µs (1/20 of the Kolmogorov time)
in an Rλ = 970 ﬂow.

The primary results of this paper concern the ﬂuid particle accelerations which, unlike the
particle velocity, cannot be measured with an Eulerian (ﬁxed) probe. We tested the long-standing
Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction that the acceleration variance scales as ǫ3/2, (or ˜u9/2). At low
Reynolds number, our data is consistent with the DNS ﬁnding that the Kolmogorov constant

a0 is proportional to R
approximately constant, indicating that K41 theory approximates the acceleration scaling in this
range of Rλ well. Turbulent intermittency models generally predict a very weak dependence of
a0 on Reynolds number (for example, R0.135
in Borgas’ model) but experimental errors currently

The fact that the ﬂow between counter-rotating disks has a well-deﬁned anisotropy allows us
to test the coupling of the acceleration to the structure of the large scale ﬂow. While the veloc-
ity exhibits a signiﬁcant anisotropy which is independent of Reynolds number, the acceleration
exhibits a smaller anisotropy which decreases as the Reynolds number is increased, as shown in
ﬁgure 27.

The autocorrelation function of the acceleration component was also measured. Because of
measurement volume effects, this measurement was restricted to relatively high Reynolds num-
bers. The functions obtained agree with low Rλ DNS simulations, crossing zero at approximately
2.1 τη, and exhibit Kolmogorov scaling of the time.

The acceleration is found to be an extremely intermittent variable, as evidenced by the very
long stretched exponential tails of the acceleration component PDF, shown in ﬁgures 19 and 21.

FIGURE 33. a0 (normalized acceleration variance) as a function of relative particle density for 450 µm
particles at Rλ = 970.

The level of intermittency, reﬂected in the acceleration component ﬂatness, is found to increase
with Reynolds number. This is consistent both with the general expectation that turbulent inter-
mittency should increase as the width of the scaling range increases, and with DNS measurements
of the ﬂatness at low Reynolds number.

The fast temporal response of the particle tracking system allows us to resolve the extremely
violent events that make up the tails of the acceleration component PDF. The trajectory in ﬁgure 1
represents one such event, in which the particle acceleration rises to 16,000 m s−2, 1,600 times
the acceleration of gravity, and 40 times the rms value. Although we do not have quantitative
evidence, we make the observation that the high acceleration events appearing in the tails of
the acceleration distributions (such as ﬁgure 1) seem to be associated with coherent structures
which persist for many Kolmogorov times, substantially longer than the correlation time of the
acceleration components.

Particular attention has been paid to the determination of measurement errors. We have devel-
oped a numerical simulation of the detection process that takes input trajectories and models the
optics and electronics to create artiﬁcial data. Using this approach we have measured the extrap-
olation error in the acceleration variance data and corrected for it. We have also conﬁrmed that
our analysis codes and choices for the analysis parameters are not biasing the results.

The dependence of the particle acceleration variance on the tracer particle size and density
was also measured. It is found that the acceleration observed with 47 µm diameter polystyrene
particles is within 7% of the value that would be obtained from ideal ﬂuid particles, even at the
highest Reynolds numbers studied. We ﬁnd that particles of diameter 450 µm (26 η) have an
acceleration variance that is a factor of 3.6 smaller than ﬂuid particles. In our experiment, this is
caused primarily by the size of the particles and is only slightly affected by their density mismatch
with the ﬂuid. These measurements validate our Lagrangian acceleration measurements, and
in addition they highlight the need for a deeper understanding of the motion of large density
matched particles in turbulence.

The techniques and measurements presented in this paper suggest many possibilities for the
future development of optical particle tracking in turbulence. The use of high resolution imaging
equipment and careful attention to measurement errors will continue to be essential in future mea-
surements. Possible extensions of the techniques presented here include lengthening the tracking
times, improving the resolution of the three-dimensional measurements and tracking larger num-
bers of particles simultaneously. These will allow precise high Reynolds number experimental
measurements of additional quantities including relative dispersion, scaling in the inertial time
range, and the geometry of multi-particle Lagrangian motion.

Appendix A. Extraction of Particle Tracks from Intensity Data

The raw data from the strip detector consists of a series of one-dimensional intensity proﬁles
taken at regular time intervals. The task of recognizing peaks in these intensity proﬁles and as-
sembling them into two-dimensional or three-dimensional tracks is, in principal, similar to the
case of two-dimensional CCD images (Virant & Dracos 1997; Ott & Mann 2000; Dracos 1996).
However, the strip detector poses unique challenges. Particle tracks cross much more often in
one-dimensional than in two-dimensional , and ﬂaws in the detector lead to a number of inop-
erative strips. Both of these effects cause frequent drop-outs in tracks, which would result in
fragmentation of the trajectories.

The strategy for extracting tracks from the intensity data is as follows. The task is divided
into four phases, peak detection, track building, track splicing and track ﬁltering. In cases where
two-dimensional trajectories are investigated, the tracks are then passed to a matching algorithm
which associates x and y tracks to form two-dimensional trajectories.
Peak Detection. The algorithm scans each frame and identiﬁes distinct groups of above-threshold
strips, and searches each group for one or more peaks, taking into account the existence of in-
operative strips. Valid peaks are passed to a routine which calculates moments of the peak and
ﬁts it to a Gaussian function, returning properties including peak centre, amplitude, full-width at
half maximum, area skewness and ﬂatness. The output of the peak detection algorithm is a list of
peaks for each frame.
Track Building. The track ﬁnding algorithm assembles the peaks found by the peak detector
into time-continuous tracks. This algorithm builds tracks incrementally, extrapolating each track
forward one frame and searching for a peak which is the continuation of the track. If any ambi-
guity is found—if there is more than one peak which might continue the track, or if there is more
than one track which might continue onto a peak—the track building algorithm fails to resolve
the match and begins new tracks as necessary.
Splicing. The list of tracks generated by the track builder is passed to a splicer which connects
track fragments which the track builder failed to connect due to ambiguities. Such ambiguities are
quite common in one-dimensional projection, since tracks can cross in one-dimensional projection
even when the two-dimensional trajectories are distinct. The track builder looks more than one
frame ahead, and compares forward extrapolations of the ends of tracks to backward extrapola-
tions of the beginnings of tracks. It uses an iterative algorithm to make the best matches, while
leaving ambiguous matches unresolved.
Filtering. After the splicing algorithm has exited, the tracks are processed by a ﬁltering algo-
rithm. The algorithm will delete data points which meet certain criterion. These criterion include
upper and lower limits on the amplitude, and upper limits on the width and ﬂatness of the peak.
The algorithm also deletes data points which coincide with a list of inoperative strips. The idea
is to keep marginally accurate data during the track assembly process to maintain the continu-
ity of the tracks, but to exclude such data from subsequent statistical analysis, where the large
uncertainties could be detrimental to the analysis.
Coordinate Matching. Most of the acceleration data reported below is derived from two-dimensional trajectories.
To obtain two-dimensional trajectories, it is necessary to match the x vs. t and z vs. t trajectories

which are obtained from the two strip detectors. All such data is taken in the conﬁguration shown
in ﬁgure 5(a), in which the same image is projected on two strip detectors, and only the segments
of tracks that lie in the overlap region of the two detectors (See ﬁgure 7) are used. In this case, the
optical intensity recorded by the two detectors for a single track is highly correlated. The auto-
correlation function between the two trajectories is therefore a good ﬁgure of merit for matching
the tracks.

Appendix B. Reinterpretation of previous data.

The data presented in this paper should be compared with previously published measurements
of the same quantities in the same turbulent ﬂow, but using a conventional position sensitive
photodiode instead of the strip detector to measure particle trajectories (Voth et al. 1998). The
previous study reached the correct conclusion that the Heisenberg-Yaglom scaling of the accel-
eration variance is observed at high Reynolds numbers, but because of limitations of the detector
technology the numerical values obtained for the physical quantities involved were inaccurate.

The discrepancy can be largely attributed to the high noise level in the position sensitive photo-
diode that resulted in much greater uncertainty in the particle position measurements and which
necessitated the use of much larger tracer particles. The intrinsic bandwidth of the UDT DLS-10
position sensitive photodiode used in the previous experiments is approximately 5 MHz, but tem-
poral averaging of the signal was used to increase the effective position resolution at the expense
of temporal resolution. Signal averaging with an effective bandwidth of 100 kHz was used in
conjunction with tracer particles of diameter 250 µm or 450 µm, which gave a position resolu-
tion of 10 µm over a ﬁeld of 1.5 mm, corresponding to a dynamic range of 150. By contrast, the
strip detector at 70 kHz has a position uncertainty of approximately 0.1 strips on a ﬁeld of 512
strips (0.8 µm over a ﬁeld of 4 mm), giving a dynamic range of 5000, which is a factor of 30
improvement. Another critical advantage of the strip detector is that it is able make these posi-
tion measurements with 47 µm diameter particles. As reported in Section 5 above, the 250 µm
particles which were required by the position sensitive photodiode do not follow the ﬂow at high
Reynolds number and result in signiﬁcant underestimate of the acceleration.

The position sensitive photodiode is strictly limited to single particle statistics, so that the en-
ergy dissipation could not be measured in terms of velocity structure functions. Instead, the ac-
celeration autocorrelation function was compared with DNS results to estimate the Kolmogorov
time, and this value was used to determine the rate of energy dissipation. Presumably due to
the fact that the 250 µm particles did not adequately follow the ﬂow, the estimate of the Kol-
mogorov time was a factor 2.37 larger than the current value, and using ǫ = (ν/ǫ)1/2, this gave
an estimate of the energy dissipation which is a factor 5.63 below the current value at a given
propeller speed. The rms velocity ˜u was also underestimated by 10% in the old experiment, and
using equation 3.7 the new values obtained for Rλ are smaller than the old by a factor of 0.52,
so the previously reported range of Rλ (985–2021) would correspond to (512–1037) using the
new calibration. The ability to work at much smaller Rλ (down to 140) results from the use of
smaller particles, which do not settle out of the ﬂow even at very slow propeller speeds.

The Kolmogorov constant a0 is calculated from

and is also affected by this inaccuracy in the estimate of ǫ, and would have increased the value
of a0 by a factor of 17. However, the particle size effects and low spatial resolution caused the
acceleration variance to be underestimated by a large factor. In the old study, an extrapolation
to zero ﬁt time was attempted, but large position errors obscured the exponential dependence of
acceleration variance on ﬁt time that is seen in ﬁgure 23. What was interpreted as “measurement

noise” was in reality a blend of measurement error and and short-time turbulence contributions.
The algorithm used to calculate the acceleration variance gave a value which was effectively
coarse grained over a time interval which was believed to be 2.5 τη using the old calibration, but
which is actually 6 τη using the new calibration. As may be seen from ﬁgure 23, this results in
a substantial underestimate of the acceleration variance. The acceleration variance was further
reduced by the particle size effect associated with the use of 250 µm particles. The fact that the
value of a0 reported in the previous experiment (7
6)
is due to the fortuitous cancellation of errors in the measurement of the dissipation rate and of
the acceleration variance.

Abstrat

A alulational approah in (cid:29)uid turbulene is presented. A tur-

bulent environment is thought to be a ondition of the system for

whih the time and spae evolution of the dynamial variables are

haoti, but for whih a statistial distribution funtion is appliable.

The time-evolution of an initially given probability distribution fun-

tion for the dynamial variables is given by the deterministi evolution

equations that govern the system, alled deterministi haos. A (cid:29)uid

environment is a dynamial system, having energy input mehanisms

at long distane sales ourring on the spatial boundaries and energy

dissipation mehanisms due to visosity ourring on small distane

sales. Hene, the (cid:29)uid has an attrator, alled the Strange Attrator

in the turbulent regime, for its dynamial variables.

It is proposed

here that the (cid:29)uid probability density funtional also has an attra-

tor for its time-evolution, and an approah to generating this time-

evolution of the statistis is presented. The same mehanism that

auses the dynamial variables to have an attrator in phase spae,

that is the tendeny for the equilibration of energy input rates and

energy output rates to set in, also auses an arbitrary initial statistis

to evolve toward an attrating statistis, whih is stationary in time.

It is this stationary statistis that allow the Kolmogorov saling ideas

to have appliability. The evolution of the (cid:29)uid's statistis an be set

1

up as part of a spae-time path integral. Ensemble averages of any

dynamial variable an be formulated in terms of this path integral.

Fluid spae-time on(cid:28)guration sampling tehniques naturally suggest

a useful way, using a relatively arbitrary initial statistis funtional to

alulate averages.

1 Desription of the Mathematial Ap-

proah to Fluid Turbulene

Let us set up the evolution equations for inompressible (cid:29)uid dynamis.

The extension of the proposal to be desribed to ompressible (cid:29)uid

dynamis will pose no unusual di(cid:30)ulty.

We have,

ρ

d~v
dt

= ~f + η

2~v,

∇

where

~f is an external fore density, suh as due to a salar pressure
(cid:28)eld, and η is the oe(cid:30)ient of visosity. ~v is the (cid:29)uid veloity (cid:28)eld.

We also have,

Here, ρ is the mass density of the (cid:29)uid.

If this mass density is a

onstant, then the veloity (cid:28)eld is divergeneless. Also,

(ρ~v) +

= 0.

d~v

=

∂~v

So we have the (cid:29)uid dynami system,

where P is the pressure, and ν

≡

We drop the external fore density in what follows. This is not

an essential step. What are needed are a set of interating (cid:28)elds, not

restrited to being veloity (cid:28)elds, together with stationary boundary

onditions to allow the deterministi time-evolution of the set. We also

assoiate with the veloity (cid:28)eld a probability density funtional, ρ[v, t].

The (cid:29)uid statistis time-evolves aording to deterministi haos [1℄ [2℄,

ρ[vf , tf ] =

d[v0]K[vf , tf ; v0, t0]ρ[v0, t0],

Z

2

where the kernel is,

K[v, t; v0, t0] = δ[vf −

vclassical[tf ; v0, t0]].

That is, the number, ρ, assoiated with the veloity (cid:28)eld v0 at time t0
will be assoiated with vf at time tf , where vf is the veloity (cid:28)eld v0
deterministially evolves into from time t0 . Given a funtional of the
spatial veloity, A[v], its ensemble average, at time tf is,

< A[v] >=

d[vf ]A[vf ]K[vf , tf ; v0, t0]ρ[v0]d[v0].

Z

How do we propagate the (cid:29)uid's statistis aording to determin-

isti haos, when the detailed (cid:29)uid orbits are haoti? Consider the

following. Let,

< A[v] >=

A[vf ]K[vf , v0]ρ[v0]d]vf ]d[v0],

Z

and

K[vf , v0] = δ[vf −

f3[v0]]d[v1]d[v2]d[v3]

where the veloity (cid:28)elds, v1 , v2 , v3 , et. our in hronologial order,
v1 being losest to time tf . Eventually, we have an fM , where M is
large, suh that vM = fM [v0] is in(cid:28)nitessimally di(cid:27)erent from v0 .

We must have,

K[vf , v0] = δ[vf −
and similarly for any of the fM 's. We have

f [v0]] = δ[f −1[vf ]

v0],

ρ[vf ] =

δ[f −1[vf ]
= ρ[f −1[vf ]].

Suppose f −1
M [vM ] has several roots, v0. This means f [v] is a many-to-
one rule, and f −1[v] is a one-to-many rule. We need other onditions
to make our orrespondene between vf and v0 be one-to-one.

3

Let us say that there are two onditions, f1[v] = 0, and f2[v] = 0,
that if implemented with f [v] would make the orrespondene between
vf and v0 be one-to-one. How do we implement these onditions in our
path integral for < A[v] >? We need to insert into the path integral

a funtional that is one when we have a spatial veloity on(cid:28)guration

satisfying f1[vi] = 0 and f2[vi] = 0, where vi is a spatial veloity
(cid:28)eld on(cid:28)guration ourring between times t0 and tf , and that is zero

otherwise. That funtion is,

e−(f1[vi]2+f2[vi]2)/ǫ

lim
ǫ→0+

where vi is an intermediate time spatial veloity (cid:28)eld.

Then we may say,

< A[v] > =

tf

f [v]]λ[

The funtional integration is over all spae-time veloity (cid:28)elds within

the spatial system, between times t0 and tf . δ[v
f [v]] is a spae-time
delta funtional. f [v] onnets v from a v at an earlier instant to a later

−

instant, with a possible many-to-one or one-to-many orrespondene.

The λ[v] funtionals are evaluated at a partiular instant and provide
the neessary onstraints to make the orrespondene between vf and
v0 be one-to-one.

The veloity (cid:28)eld has an attrator, determined by the stationary

boundary onditions on the (cid:29)uid. When the boundary onditions al-

low steady laminar (cid:29)ow to beome established, the attrator onsists

of a single veloity (cid:28)eld. When the Reynolds number beomes large

enough, bifurations set in, or the onset of instability ours, and the

attrator begins to onsist of more than one spatial veloity (cid:28)eld. In

the turbulent regime, the attrator onsists of many veloity (cid:28)elds,

and the (cid:29)uid aesses these veloity (cid:28)elds aording to a probabilty

distribution.

Given a funtional of the spatial veloity (cid:28)eld, A[v], and the (cid:29)uid

dynami system of equations 1, 2, we will say that its ensemble average

when the system has reahed its attrator is,

< A[v] > =

reases the lattie (cid:28)neness and makes use of higher order (cid:28)nite dif-

ferene approximations applied to partial di(cid:27)erential equations [3℄. A

good approximation to the attrating statistis as a starting point will

5

shorten the evolution time required for aurate results for averages

ourring in the steady state. The path integral 5 an be evaluated

with Monte Carlo tehniques utilizing importane sampling. One will

1, < A[v] >= 1, and obtain a alulable
use the fat that for A[v]
expression, < A[v] >, for any other < A[v] > . A alulation of the

≡

stationary veloity (cid:28)eld that would exist, for the given boundary on-

ditions, if that (cid:28)eld were stable, should be a good starting point from

whih to begin a sampling of the veloity (cid:28)eld spae-time on(cid:28)guration

spae.

2 Summary

We have said that the time evolution of the statistis also has an

attrator for (cid:28)ve reasons;

1. It is a way to get a solution to the problem of arriving at the

steady-state turbulene statistis. One knows that the steady

state statistis is stationary with respet to its time-evolver. Propos-

ing that this statistis is the attrator of its time-evolver means

one does not have to have the statistis to get the statistis,

thereby o(cid:27)ering a solution to the losure problem for the deter-

mination of orrelations.

2. The statistial physis approah has been suessful in equilib-

rium thermodynamis where the derivation of the miroanonial

ensemble an be taken as the indiation that equilibrium is the

attrator for the dynamial system when the boundary ondi-

tions on the system input no energy. In the attrator, the mean

energy input is equilibrated with the mean energy output, be-

ause in the attrator dissipative losses have e(cid:27)etively shut o(cid:27),

and the system beomes e(cid:27)etively Hamiltonian. The stationar-

ity of the statistis requires the vanishing of the Poisson braket

of the statistis with this Hamiltonian resulting in the statistis

of equal a priori probability.

3. The dynamial system, of whih a (cid:29)uid is an example, has an

attrator [4℄. The dynamis of the statistial approah should

mirror the dynamis of the atual dynamial system.

4. The statistis of the dynamial system prior to reahing the at-

trator has no reason to be unique. The statistis of the attrator

is unique, in whih the geometry of the system, the stationary

6

boundary onditions, and the visosities, all of whih determine

the Reynolds number, play a ruial role in determining the at-

trator.

5. The stationary statistis of the (cid:29)uid ours when the equilibra-

tion of energy input and energy output has set in [5℄.

3 Conlusions

In the disretized version of the path integral that attempts to arrive

at the stationary statistial e(cid:27)ets in the generation of the ensemble

average of a dynamial variable, one should arrive at, in the ontinuum

limit, a greater insensitivity to the initial statistis and a generation

of the steady-state statistial e(cid:27)ets. These steady-state statistial

e(cid:27)ets beome the bakdrop for Kolmogorov's ideas of self-similarity

and the resulting saling relations.

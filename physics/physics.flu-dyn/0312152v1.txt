Toward a description of contact line motion at higher capillary numbers

Jens Eggers

The surface of a liquid near a moving contact line is highly curved owing to diverging viscous forces.
Thus, microscopic physics must be invoked at the contact line and matched to the hydrodynamic
solution farther away. This matching has already been done for a variety of models, but always
assuming the limit of vanishing speed. This excludes phenomena of the greatest current interest,
in particular the stability of contact lines. Here we extend perturbation theory to arbitrary order
and compute ﬁnite speed corrections to existing results. We also investigate the impact of the
microscopic physics on the large-scale shape of the interface.

The moving contact line problem is a famous example
of hydrodynamics failing to describe a macroscopic ﬂow
phenomenon. But it was only in 1971 that Huh and
Scriven [1] discovered that the viscous dissipation in the
ﬂuid wedge bordered by a solid and a ﬂuid-gas interface is
logarithmically inﬁnite if the standard no-slip boundary
condition [2] is applied at the solid surface. Thus inﬁnite
force would be required to submerge a solid body, and a
drop could never spread on a table.

This result is of course contradicted by observation,
and physical eﬀects that relieve the singularity have to be
invoked near the contact line, which go beyond the stan-
dard description. A great variety of possible mechanisms
have been proposed, and indeed there is no reason to be-
lieve that for diﬀerent solid-ﬂuid-gas systems always the
same mechanism is involved. However, a question rarely
considered is whether the choice of diﬀerent microscopic
mechanisms would make a great diﬀerence when looked
at macroscopically.

In a recent paper [3] we compared various microscopic
models in the case of perfect wetting. We found that the
length scale that appears in the expression for the inter-
face shape is strongly speed dependent, in a fashion that
depends on the model. Here we are going to show that
this dependence is much weaker in the case of partial
wetting, and diﬀerences only come in at higher order in
an expansion in capillary number Ca = U η/γ, where η
is the viscosity of the ﬂuid, and γ the surface tension be-
tween liquid and gas. Finite capillary number corrections
are of interest for various situations of “forced” wetting,
in which Ca is no longer asymptotically small, and previ-
ous theories for the dynamic interface angle break down
[4].

For simplicity, we perform our calculations within the
framework of lubrication theory, assuming a parabolic
ﬂow proﬁle. This limits applications to the case of small
contact angles, but without altering the essential struc-
ture of the problem. We consider the neighborhood of
a contact line moving with speed U across a solid in a
frame of reference in which the contact line is ﬁxed at
the origin of the coordinate system (see Fig.1). To re-
lieve the corner singularity, we allow the ﬂuid to slide

at the plate, where h(x) is the thickness of the ﬂuid layer,
and λ is taken as a constant rather than a speed depen-
dent quantity. The case α = 1 corresponds to the usual
Navier slip, and (1) is a simple generalization involving
only a single length scale λ. The resulting lubrication
equation is [6]

.

(2)

The left-hand side corresponds to viscous forces, di-
verging as the contact line position h(0) = 0 is ap-
proached, but weakened by the presence of slip. Vis-
cous forces are balanced by surface tension forces on the
right, resulting in a highly curved interface near the con-
tact line. In comparison, other forces like gravity have
been neglected. This restricts the validity of (2) to a
distance from the contact line below the capillary length
ℓc =
γ/(ρg). We also assume that the angle at the

p

contact line h′(0) = θe is constant, independent of speed.
Hence it has to coincide with the equilibrium contact an-
gle, in order to give the right result at vanishing speed.
Since we want to investigate the neighborhood of the
contact line, it is convenient to introduce the scaled vari-
ables

h(x) = 31/(2−α)λH(ξ),

ξ = xθe/[31/(2−α)λ],

(3)

which leads to

δ

H 2 + H α = −H

′′′

.

From the scaling (3) it is evident that the curvature
of the interface h′′(x) scales like λ−1, where λ is in the
order of nanometers [3]. Thus, in order to match the
local solution near the contact line to an outer proﬁle
with a curvature of order 1/ℓc, the curvature H ′′(ξ) has
to vanish for large ξ. This means the boundary conditions
for the solution of (4) are

H(0) = 0, H

(0) = 1, H

(∞) = 0.

The only parameter appearing in the problem is now the
rescaled capillary number δ = 3Ca/θ3
e.

For δ > 0 equations (4) and (5) have a unique asymp-
totic solution, due to Voinov [8], for which the slope be-
haves like H ′(ξ) = [3δ ln(ξ/ξ0)]1/3 for ξ ≫ 1. This solu-
tion has vanishing curvature at inﬁnity and only contains
a single free parameter ξ0, to be determined by matching
to the contact line. In the present paper, we are going
to deal exclusively with this wetting situation. If δ < 0,
the mathematical structure of (4) changes completely.
This can be seen from considering the simpler equation
δ/H 2 = −H ′′′, valid for large H. Namely, it follows from
an exact solution [9] to this equation, that for δ < 0
all solutions have strictly positive curvature at inﬁnity.
The consequences of this observation for the stability of
contact lines are explored in another paper [10].

The mathematical problem to be tackled in this letter
consists in computing ξ0 as a function of δ. As was done
in previous works [6, 11, 12, 13], we proceed by expanding
around the trivial solution at zero speed δ = 0. In this
case, the solution of (4) and (5) is evidently given by
H(ξ) = ξ. Hence the perturbation expansion we seek
looks like

for the slope.

This is to be compared to the full asymptotic expansion
of (4) in ln(ξ) [14], the leading term corresponding to
Voinov’s solution:

All coeﬃcients b1 = 1/3, b2 = −10/27, . . . are readily
computable. Expanding (7) in δ and comparing to (6)
leads to the following structure of the expansion of ln(ξ0):

same manner. Integrating the ﬁrst order equation (10)
thrice gives

H1 = [ln(ξ + 1)(ξ + 1)2 − ξ − ξ2 ln(ξ)]/2,

thus specifying the r.h.s. of equation (12). The trick
used to calculate c1 at ﬁrst order can be repeated at the
next order, using the second equation of (9) and c1 = 0.

In summary, we thus have c2 = (π2 − 1)/2 for α = 1
and c2 = (3π2 − 4)/8 for α = 0, which follows from
a very similar calculation.
It is evident that the same
procedure can be repeated at arbitrary order, although
the calculation rapidly becomes analytically intractable.
Rewriting the rescaled solution H(ξ) in terms of the
physical proﬁle h(x), we ﬁnd the slope of the interface to
be

′3(x) − θ3

e = 9Ca ln(x/L)

(13)

for any capillary number. This is the form originally pro-
posed by Voinov [8], using more qualitative arguments.
The length L appearing inside the logarithm can be writ-
ten as an expansion in the capillary number:

(14)

Integrating equation (2) numerically, a comparison
with (13) can be made, giving L as function of capil-
lary number. In Fig.2 it is clearly seen that our expan-
sion (14) describes the initial departure from the leading
order result quite well. However, when the corrections
amount to about 10% of the leading order, higher order

3

terms become important. Thus as a rough estimate, the
present approach can be trusted if δ = Ca/δ3
∼ 0.05.
It would be interesting to systematically investigate the
dependence of L on the capillary number beyond that
value.

Comparing (13) to de Gennes’ result [15]

e )h

(x) = 6Ca ln(x/λ),

(15)

one ﬁnds that the two laws agree if the departure of h′(x)
from θe is small. Beyond the leading order expansion of
h′(x) in Ca, however, (13) and (15) are inconsistent. This
casts doubts on the original argument for (15), which
should also apply to the class of simple slip models con-
sidered here, and which has already been reviewed in a
critical light in [12]. In particular, this calls into question
de Gennes’ theory [15] of contact line instability, which
crucially uses (15).

Finally, it should be realized that we have assumed
that the local proﬁle as described by (2) can be treated
independently. The only eﬀect of the outer proﬁle comes
in with the boundary condition of vanishing curvature
(5). Earlier work [6, 11] includes the matching to an
outer proﬁle, but arrives at the same results as we do
to leading order in Ca. At elevated capillary numbers,
however, diﬀerent parts of the solution may interact in a
non-trivial way, and matching may be necessary.

Two-dimensional Boussinesq convection is studied numerically with very ﬁne spatial resolutions
up to 40962. Our numerical study starts with a smooth asymmetric initial condition, which is
chosen to make the ﬂow ﬁeld well conﬁned in the computational domain until the blow-up time
(Tc). Our study shows that the vorticity will blow up at a ﬁnite time with |ω|max ∼ (Tc − t)−1.61
and |∇θ|max ∼ (Tc − t)−3.58

Understanding whether smooth initial conditions in
three-dimensional (3D) Euler equations can develop sin-
gularities in a ﬁnite time is an important step in under-
standing high-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics [1, 2].
Two-dimensional (2D) Boussinesq convection is a sim-
pliﬁed model of the 3D axisymmetric ﬂows with swirl
if main ﬂow structures are well away from the symme-
try axis
[3]. The computing requirements of the 2D
Boussinesq simulations are signiﬁcantly less than those
of the 3D Euler equations. However, the spatial resolu-
tions adopted have still been not ﬁne enough to resolve
the small scale structure. Therefore, the spectral meth-
ods
[3, 5, 6] are
mostly adopted. One central issue of this study is on
whether there exist singularities in the 2D Boussinesq
ﬂows.
If we denote Tc the time of blowup, the min-
imum criterion for the breakdown of smooth solutions
in the 2D Boussinesq equations is: |ω|max ∼ (Tc − t)−α
and |∇θ|max ∼ (Tc − t)−β, where α ≥ 1 and β ≥ 2
[4, 7]. Adaptive mesh techniques [3, 5, 6] and the spec-
tral method [4] are adopted to investigate this problem,
which yield various conclusions, e.g.,
[4, 6] observe no
vorticity blow-up, while [3, 5] only provide the marginal
values (α = 1 and β = 2) although these studies predict
vorticity singularities.

[4] and the adaptive mesh methods

Since the fast developed adaptive mesh methods are
limited by the ﬁnite-order accuracy and mesh equality, a
further “spectral” eﬀort seems necessary to investigate
this challenging problem. The spectral methods have
been used intensively in 3D Euler simulations, but they
are limited by the available computing capability: the
ﬁnest resolutions used so far have been 20483 [8]. The
conclusions are aﬀected by certain kind of symmetric
assumptions introduced to increase the eﬀective resolu-
tions [9, 10]. We can argue that the conclusion drawn by

∗Electronic address: zhaohua.yin@imech.ac.cn
†Electronic address: ttang@math.hkbu.edu.hk

the 3D studies [8, 11] is not necessarily more convincing
than the axisymmetric assumption [4] where a resolu-
tion of 15002 is adopted.
In this study, spectral com-
putations with extremely high resolution (from 20482 to
40962) are carried out to investigate the blow-up issue
for the 2D Boussinesq convection problem. Moreover,
we try to maintain the ﬂow structure well away from the
axis at the time when solutions begin to blow up. This is
done by choosing appropriate initial data. The govern-
ing equations are solved by a fully de-alias pseudospectral
Fourier methods with 8/9 phase-shifted scheme. The dig-
ital ﬁlter is adopted to modify the Fourier coeﬃcient to
increase the stability of the numerical codes. The ma-
chine accuracy of our computer with double precision is
ǫ = 10−16 ≈ e−37, and the modifying factor in the ﬁlter
is ϕ(k) = e−37(k/N )
for k < N [12]. With these eﬀorts,
the vorticity blow-up is observed, which is in contrast
to the conclusion drawn by the earlier spectral computa-
tions [4].

The non-dimensionized 2D inviscid Boussinesq convec-

tion equations can be written in the ω-ψ formulation:

θt + u · ∇θ = 0,
ωt + u · ∇ω = −θx,
∆ψ = −ω,

where the gravitational constant is normalized to g =
(0, −1), θ is the temperature, u = (u,v) the velocity, ν
the kinematic viscosity, ω = (0, 0, ω) = ∇ × u vorticity,
and ψ stream function. The simulation is carried out in
the [0, 2π]2 doubly-periodic domain. At ﬁrst, we take the
initial condition with uniﬁed zero vorticity and a cap-like
contour of temperature with the following expression:

exp (cid:0)1 − (1 − s(y)2)−1(cid:1), and zero otherwise. This ini-
tial condition (4) is similar to [4] except that a factor
(4x − 3π)/π s used to break down the ﬁeld symmetry
with respect to x = π. The main ﬂow structure looks
like a rising bubble which touches the y = 0 and y = 2π
boundaries at t ≃ 2.0. This will cause the singularity at
the axis if we transform the 2D Boussinesq results back
to the 3D axisymmetric ﬂow [1]. To ﬁx this problem, we
compress the intermediate results at t = 1.2 obtained by

using the initial condition (4) to form a new initial data.
More precisely, we let ω(x, y, 0) = ω′(x, 2y−0.4π, 1.2) and
θ(x, y, 0) = θ′(x, 2y − 0.4π, 1.2), for (x, y) ∈ [0, 2π] × [0, π]
(where θ′ and ω′ are obtained by solving (1)-(4) with a
20482 grid), and zero otherwise. The new initial condi-
tion only needs about 1/4 simulation time to reach Tc
comparing with the run in [4], and advantages of higher
resolutions show up at early stages of simulations (Figs.
4). The time steps for the resolutions 10242, 20482 and

and (b) demonstrate that the global average quantities
are well conserved within 1% error for all the three res-
olutions used. The ﬂow ﬁeld develops into many small
vortices after t = 0.8 and more and more energy is re-
moved by the ﬁlter in the time evolution. Hence, it seems
that simulations with higher resolution do not have more
advantages here.

However, the time evolution of the maximum values
of θ, which is also time-independent, shows much better
improvement for the 40962 run by comparing with lower
resolution runs (Fig. 3 (c)): the relative error for |θ|max
with the 40962 run is always lower than 10−4, while the
corresponding error with the 10242 run is about 10−2.
Because the global maximum values of |ω| and |∇θ| are
normally used as the indicators in the singularity analy-
sis, the 40962 run may lead to a more accurate conclu-
sion than that of the 10242 and 20482 runs. It should be
pointed out that if resolutions higher than 40962 are em-
ployed then the quadruple precision (ǫ = 10−32) instead
of the double precision (ǫ = 10−16) may have to be used;
otherwise the results may be spoiled by the round-oﬀ er-
rors (see [13] for more details). The maximum vorticity
is initially located on the left edge of the rising bubble
(Fig. 1(a)), and later moved to the outer layer of the
“eyes”, (see, Figs. 1(c) and 2(a). This observation is in
good agreement to the prediction in [4]. At t = 0.88, the
|ω|max locates at (5.31, 2.72) (see the “+” in Fig. 2 (a)).
Around t ≃ 0.88, some very small vorticity structures
begin to appear at the lower part of the smooth outer
layer where the maximum |ω| appears. The ﬁlter we
adopted in the code will remove more and more energy
from the system, so that the global average values like
T2 and T4 are greatly aﬀected (Figs. 3 (a)(b)). Conse-
quently, after this critical time the numerical results in
the 40962 run may not be accurate and reliable. Actu-
ally, it is observed that the |ω|max and |∇θ|max expe-
rience a drop-down after t ≃ 0.9. This indicates that
the ﬁlter prevents the blowup of the maximum vorticity

FIG. 4:
|ω| and |∇θ| (10242: solid line, 20482: dashline, 40962: circle
line). It seems that 10242 and 20482 runs have almost iden-
tical peak values from t = 0 until t = 0.15, and the results
of 20482 and 40962 are very close until t = 0.3. There are
two reasons for these departures: 1) the ﬁlter removes more
energy for lower resolution; 2) higher resolution can make a
better ﬁt for delta-like functions.

40962 are 0.0004, 0.0002 and 0.0001, respectively, given
by the CFL condition.

The compressed bubble (Figs. 1(a)(d)) will continue
to rise, and the edge of the cap will roll up at later
1(c)(f)). At t ≃ 0.9, the density and
times (Figs.
vorticity contours develop into the shape of “two asym-
metric eyes.” The contour revolutions on three diﬀer-
ent resolutions reveal similar phenomena at this point.

[11, 14]).
in high Reynolds number simulations (e.g.
Therefore, the sample maximum values after the drop-
ping down should not be used in the singularity analysis.
For the 10242 and 20482 runs, however, the drop-downs
appear later than t ≃ 0.88 and the blow-up time Tc is
also delayed.
In Figs. 4, we only provide time evolu-
tions for |ω|max and |∇θ|max in diﬀerent resolutions be-
fore they drop down. We re-plot these maximum value
evolutions in Fig. 5. It seems that the growth of |ω|max
and |∇θ|max in the 40962 run (Fig. 5(b)) plausibly ter-
minates in a ﬁnite time with |ω|max ∼ (Tc − t)−1.61, and

crudely |∇θ|max ∼ (Tc − t)−3.58 (in the later case we only
adopt the values of |∇θ|max after t = 0.75).
It is no-
ticed that our values (α, β) = (1.61, 3.58) are larger than
the minimum blow-up values [4, 7] and the existing re-
sults [3, 4, 5]. We run our simulations until t = 2.0 and
ﬁnd that the main structure of the ﬂow ﬁeld stays away
from y = 0 and y = 2π. The axisymmetric assumption
adopted in the original 3D Euler equation model does not
cause any axis singularity diﬃculty as discussed earlier
with our new initial condition.

We have not performed the simulation on grid ﬁner
than 40962, but we can predict some results from the
present computations.
It is well known that when a
delta function is approximated by a ﬁnite Fourier series,
each doubling of the resolutions will cause doubling of
the maximum value and 2n+1 times the maximum val-
ues of the nth order space derivative (see the analysis in
Appendix A of
[11]). In the ﬁnal state of our simula-
tion (Fig. 2(a)), the cut-line at y = 2.72 through the
out layer of the “eye” looks very similar to a delta func-
tion. Therefore, when ﬁner and ﬁner resolutions are used
the peak vorticity and temperature gradient are getting
larger and larger. Further 2D Boussinesq simulations
with even higher resolution will support our singularity
prediction although it seems impossible to accurately pre-
dict the singularity time with the current computational
scheme. In Fig. 4(b), the gradients of the curves become
larger when the grids are reﬁned. The 10242 result in-
dicates no blow-up, and the singularity analysis for the
20482 run (Fig. 5(a)) shows that α = 1.28, β = 2.32 and
Tc = 1.47. The results obtained by the three resolutions
reveal that the values of Tc may be smaller than 1.34, and
the values of α and β may be larger than 1.61 and 3.58 if
much ﬁne resolutions (> 40962) are used. Although our
simulations can not provide accurate value for Tc, the
existence of singularity in the 2D Boussinesq simulations
is strongly supported by our numerical computations.

Abstract

We construct doubly periodic Stokes ﬂows in two dimensions using
elliptic functions. This method has advantages when the doubly periodic
lattice of obstacles has less than maximal symmetry. We ﬁnd the mean
ﬂow through an arbitrary lattice in response to a pressure gradient in an
arbitrary direction, and show in a typical example that the shorter of the
two period lattice vectors is an “easy direction” for the ﬂow, an eigenvector
of the conductance tensor corresponding to maximal conductance.

It is known, and we rederive it below, that two-dimensional (2D) Stokes ﬂows
can be represented in terms of two complex analytic functions [1]. It is plausible,
then, that doubly periodic 2D Stokes ﬂows should have a representation in
terms of doubly periodic complex analytic functions, that is, elliptic functions
[2, 3]. Such a representation was promised in 1959 by H. Hasimoto [4], but
it did not appear. Other authors in the succeeding decades alluded to such a
representation [5], and even, like Hasimoto, quoted results following from it [6].
The Hasimoto article may have appeared much later as lecture notes in Japanese
[7]. Meanwhile, there are other, perhaps more straightforward, ways to represent
doubly periodic 2D Stokes ﬂows. These include matching of ﬂows around a
single obstacle across periodic cell boundaries [6, 8, 9, 10, 11], integral equation
methods [12], biharmonic solvers on a grid [5], and ﬁnite element methods.

In spite of this long history, we have thought it useful to present the elliptic
function method, because there is still, apparently, no readily available descrip-
tion of it. Furthermore, as we shall show, this approach solves one aspect of the
problem which is not at all simple in the most common cell matching approach,
namely the appropriate boundary condition for ﬂow through a general periodic
lattice in a general direction. With this method we describe the typical ﬂow
through a generic lattice.

1 2D Stokes Flows

Let us represent the 2D ﬂow with velocity vector ﬁeld ~u(x, y) as a complex scalar
function u by means of the usual isomorphism

~u = uxˆx + uyˆy ↔ u(x, y) = ux + iuy

Regarding the x-y plane as the complex z plane, we note that the divergence
and curl of u are given by

div ~u = 2ℜ(∂u/∂z) = 0

curl ~u = 2ℑ(∂u/∂z) = ω

Here the ﬁrst equation expresses incompressibility of the ﬂow u, and the second
deﬁnes the vorticity ω, understood as the (scalar) component of a vector ﬁeld
normal to the plane. Similarly, the gradient of the pressure P in this complex
representation is

~∇P ↔ 2∂P/∂z

The Stokes equation, representing the balance of viscous stress in the ﬂuid by
the pressure gradient, then becomes

µ∇2~u = ~∇P ↔ 4µ ∂2u/∂z∂z = 2∂P/∂z

where µ is the viscosity. In light of Eqs. (2) and (3) this means that

that is, that

∂(P/µ − iω)/∂z = 0

f (z) = P/µ − iω

is a single-valued function of z, holomorphic except for possible poles [1]. If we
choose such a function f , we can integrate Eqs. (2) and (3) to ﬁnd the ﬂow

z

u =

(zf −

f dz + g)

Z
where g(z) is a second holomorphic function, having logarithmic singularities at
the poles of f . Thus u is represented in terms of two holomorphic functions, f
and g.

The force exerted by the ﬂow u on a ﬁnite obstacle, given by closed contour
C, just involves the enclosed residues of f . The force on a small, oriented line
segment ∆z due to the ﬂuid on its right is

∆F = iP ∆z + 2iµ(∂u/∂z)∆z

(9)

Now, using Eqs. (7) and (8), and integrating over the closed curve C, oriented
in the conventional positive direction, we ﬁnd the force on C due to the ﬂuid

2 Pressure in Doubly Periodic Flows

Consider the integer lattice generated by two complex numbers, ω1 and ω3, with
ℑ(ω3/ω1) > 0, consisting of the points

Wmn = 2mω1 + 2nω3

(13)

for all integers m and n. Suppose identical obstacles are located at these places,
forming a doubly periodic array. A Stokes ﬂow through this array, represented
as in Eq. (8), is characterized by a function f with very restrictive properties.
It is single-valued, it is holomorphic outside the obstacles, it has poles inside
the obstacles, its imaginary part is doubly periodic, and its real part is a doubly
periodic function plus a linear function, where the linear function is essentially
the average pressure < P >, increasing linearly along its (constant) gradient. If
we further ask for the simplest function of this type, having only simple poles
at the Wmn, then there is essentially only one possibility, the Weierstrass zeta
function ζ(z), with a linear correction. This follows from the theory of elliptic
functions [2]. (Note that ζ depends also on the lattice constants ω1 and ω3, but
we regard these as ﬁxed parameters and do not indicate this dependence.)

More precisely we make use of the quasi-periodicity of ζ(z),

for α = 1, 3, where ηα = ζ(ωα) are constants satisfying

Then we can take, for the function f , either of

where α = 1, 3. Using Eqs. (14) and (15), we verify that

ζ(z + 2ωα) = ζ(z) + 2ηα

η1ω3 − η3ω1 = iπ/2

fα =

[ωαζ(z) − ηαz] ,

−i
|ωα|

f1(z + 2ω1) = f1(z)
f1(z + 2ω3) = f1(z) − π/|ω1|
f3(z + 2ω1) = f3(z) + π/|ω3|
f3(z + 2ω3) = f3(z)

Thus in both functions only the real part, which we interpret as P/µ, shows a
linear growth. The average pressure gradient corresponding to fα is perpendic-
ular to ωα. From its projection on the other lattice vector we determine that it
is

< ~∇P > ↔ 2 < ∂P/∂z >=

−iωαµπ
2|ωα|ℑ(ω1ω3)

By taking linear combinations of f1 and f3 we can ﬁnd a suitable f with the
pressure gradient in any direction with respect to the lattice. The combination
corresponding to a pressure gradient of the same magnitude as f1 and f3 but in
the direction eiθ is

f = eiθζ − Cz

with

C = i

The force on the ﬂuid in a period parallelogram D, with sides 2ω1 and 2ω3,

due to the average pressure in the ﬂow corresponding to fα, is

dx dy =

Z ZD
The force on the ﬂuid due to each obstacle in this same ﬂow, since ζ(z) is
normalized to have residue 1 at each simple pole, is −2iωαµπ/|ωα|, by Eq. (12).
There is on average one obstacle in each period parallelogram. Thus the force on
the ﬂuid due to the average pressure (applied somehow from outside) is balanced
by the force due to the obstacles, and the net force on the ﬂuid is zero, as is
always the case in Stokes ﬂows.

A more general function f in the representation of Eq. (8) for the Stokes
ﬂow u would be a superposition of translates of f1 and f3, always keeping
the singularities inside the obstacles, and not in the physical region of ﬂow.
Equivalently, one could take a multipole expansion of such functions. This
would be a series in derivatives of f1 and f3. These functions are doubly periodic
with higher order poles at the lattice points, that is, they are the Weierstrass P
function and its derivatives. Thus f has the form

f (z) = eiθζ − Cz +

cnP (n)

If the boundary contours have reﬂection symmetry in the origin, then it is
enough to take only the terms in the series with n odd.

where g is a second analytic function, still to be determined. We have already
used the freedom to add terms of the form g in adding a term eiθ ln σ, where σ is
the sigma function, another of the special functions of elliptic function theory [2].
Such logarithmic terms compensate the multivaluedness of logarithmic terms in
the integral of f .

Now among all the functions g that we could choose, we want the one that
makes u doubly periodic, and that makes u = 0 (say) on the boundary contours
of the obstacles. Since the logarithmic part of g has been explicitly written as
a separate term, g as deﬁned above is single-valued, and hence has a Laurent
series in a neighborhood of the origin. We must anticipate, though, that g has
singularities at all the lattice points Wmn, and hence that this series would con-
verge only out to the nearest such lattice point. This diﬃculty can be removed
because double periodicity of u determines the principal part of g at all lattice
points. We see, for example, that u blows up logarithmically at z = 0 but, be-
cause of the poles in ζ, it blows up like 1/z at every other lattice point. This is
inconsistent with double periodicity, and hence g must cancel the 1/z behavior
at all Wmn except 0. Also, in the Laurent series for g about z = 0, there will be
negative powers of z. Translates of these terms contribute to the principal part
of g at other Wmn. Let S be a set of indices (m, n) suﬃciently large to label all
Wmn in a disk large enough to contain a period parallelogram. Then we take g
in the form

g = −

j=0

(28)

Because the poles of g have been included as explicit terms, the power series
with coeﬃcients aj now converges out to the nearest Wmn not indexed in S,
and we choose this index set large enough to get good numerical behavior in
our ﬁnal step.

Lastly we specify the boundary conditions that determine the coeﬃcients an,
bn, and cn in Eqs. (27) and (28). We choose a region D with a boundary ∂D
that is entirely within the ﬂuid region, and such that every point z in ∂D has
a corresponding point z′ in ∂D displaced by one of the lattice constants ±2ωα.
Typically D would be the period parallelogram centered on the origin with
vertices (±ω1, ±ω3). We ask that the complex function u be periodic, taking
the same value at points z and z′ in ∂D related by a lattice constant, and also
that the derivative ∂u/∂z be periodic in the same sense. We also require that u
take prescribed values on the boundary contour C of the obstacle. Choosing a
large number of pairs of points (z, z′) on ∂D and also points z on C for imposing

5

these conditions, we obtain an overdetermined inhomogeneous system of linear
equations that we then solve in the sense of least squares. Because cn occurs
together with its complex conjugate cn, the system must be regarded as real
linear, not complex linear. With suitable choices for the truncation parameters
Na, Nb, and Nc, this boundary value problem has a solution accurate to many
decimal places. We conﬁrm the solutions in [6], for ﬂows through square and
triangular lattices of obstacles, to 5 decimal places, typically.

It is superﬁcially surprising that one can stipulate conditions on both u
and its derivative in this elliptic problem, but it is clear physically that such
periodic solutions must exist. It is also clear mathematically, if one considers
the equivalent Stokes ﬂow on a torus. This argument only applies, though, if the
applied stress that drives the ﬂow has all the properties that we have required of
the function f in Section 2. For other functions f the boundary value problem
would have no solution. Knowing the form of f in advance, as we do, the actual
boundary values of P and u emerge as part of the solution. Other approaches
to this problem are typically restricted to situations in which one knows the
boundary values by symmetry, where P is constant on part of ∂D, for example,
or where u is normal or tangential on ∂D, special cases that do not hold for
general lattices and ﬂows.

Let us deﬁne the mean of a ﬂow u to be the constant ﬂow V such that
the ﬂux of V and the ﬂux of u into a period parallelogram are the same. By
incompressibility of the ﬂow, this is also the ﬂux of V (and u) out of a period
parallelogram. If we take the period parallelogram to be the one with vertices
(±ω1, ±ω3), then we have the formula

V =

The integrals depend only on the endpoints, by incompressibility of the ﬂow,
and the formula is invariant under a common translation of the endpoints. Thus
the choice of period parallelogram is in fact arbitrary.

Using this formulation we have computed the tensorial relation between the
force F in Eq. (12) and the mean velocity V in Eq. (29) in many examples. For
regular square and triangular lattices, F and V are simply proportional, but
more generally

V = GF

(30)

where the conductance tensor G is a real symmetric matrix (and we are now
representing V and F as real 2-vectors, not complex scalars). A typical com-
puted ﬂow is shown in Figure 1. Here ω1 = 1, ω3 = 0.2 + 0.5i, and the circular
obstacles have radius 0.2. The pressure gradient F is in the y direction, but
the mean ﬂow V is approximately along ω3, the shorter of the lattice vectors.
The reason for this behavior is simple, and in accord with common sense. The
direction of ω3 is an “easy direction” for the ﬂow, an eigenvector of G, and
the corresponding conductance eigenvalue for the rather wide “channels” along
this direction is large. The obstacles, being relatively closely spaced along the
direction of ω3, create “walls” along the sides of the channels. The conductance

Figure 1: A Stokes ﬂow through a lattice of circular obstacles is shown in four
period parallelograms. The lattice vectors are ω1 = 1, ω3 = 0.2 + 0.5i, and the
obstacles have radius 0.2. The pressure gradient is vertical, but the mean ﬂow
is, to good approximation, along ω3, the shorter of the lattice vectors.

corresponding to the other, perpendicular eigenvector, normal to the “walls”,
is much smaller than the conductance along the channels. The ratio of the two
eigenvalues, a measure of the anisotropy of the conductance tensor, is about
2.545 in this example, noticeably more anisotropic than the lattice itself. It is
clear that the conductance anisotropy could be indeﬁnitely large for this lattice
if the round obstacles were larger and almost touched along the ω3 direction.

The theory described here provides a starting point for problems involving
ﬂow near ciliated surfaces. Within a ciliated layer, the cilia, hairlike projections
from the surface, would constitute the regular array of obstacles. In the simplest
case they would be rigid and perpendicular to the surface. Consider, for exam-
ple, a straight pipe of circular cross section, with such a ciliated inner surface,
still leaving a free cylindrical channel down the center. Suppose the length of
the cilia is much greater than the mean distance between them, and much less
than the radius of the pipe. The Poiseuille ﬂow problem asks for the ﬂow in
response to a pressure diﬀerence between one end of the pipe and the other.
The usual boundary condition says that the ﬂow should be zero on the walls of
the pipe, and this condition still determines the ﬂow in a thin region near the
wall, comparable in thickness to the mean spacing of the cilia, but within most
of the ciliated layer, the mean ﬂow will be given in the manner described here.
Via a similarly thin transition layer, the Poiseuille ﬂow down the unobstructed

7

central channel matches this mean ﬂow at its edge. Systematic anisotropy in
the placement of the cilia, including, one must anticipate, a merely statistical
anisotropy, would impart rotation to the ﬂuid channel, as it amounts to a “ri-
ﬂing” of the inner surface of the pipe. Considerations of this kind are relevant
in biological settings where such surfaces are very common. The cilia as we
have just described them are merely passive obstacles, but often they are active
agents driving ﬂows. The methods of this paper could also be a starting point
for treating such phenomena, as we hope to show in the future.

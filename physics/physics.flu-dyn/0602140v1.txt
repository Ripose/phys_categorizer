Abstract

Fundamental aspects of inverse kinetic theories for the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations [Ellero and Tessarotto, 2004, 2005] include the possibility of deﬁning
uniquely the kinetic equation underlying such models and furthermore, the con-
struction of a kinetic theory implying also the energy equation. The latter condition
is consistent with the requirement that ﬂuid ﬁelds result classical solutions of the
ﬂuid equations. These issues appear of potential relevance both from the mathe-
matical viewpoint and for the physical interpretation of the theory. Purpose of this
work is to prove that under suitable prescriptions the inverse kinetic theory can be
determined to satisfy such requirements.

1 Introduction

An aspect of ﬂuid dynamics is represented by the class of so-called inverse
problems, involving the search of model kinetic theories able to yield a pre-
scribed complete set of ﬂuid equations advancing in time a suitable set of ﬂuid
ﬁelds. This is achieved by means of suitable velocity-moments of an appropri-
ate kinetic distribution function f (r, v,t). Among such model theories, special

relevance pertains to those in which the state of isothermal incompressible
ﬂuids is described self-consistently by suitable ﬂuid ﬁelds to be considered as
classical (i.e., strong) solutions of the corresponding ﬂuid equations (regularity
assumption). In this case the relevant ﬂuid ﬁelds are the mass density, ﬂuid
velocity and ﬂuid pressure {ρ, V,p} which are required to be classical solutions
of the so-called incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE)

The ﬁrst three equations (1),(2) and (3), denoting respectively the continuity,
Navier-Stokes and isochoricity equations, are assumed to be satisﬁed in the
open set Ω ⊆ R3 (ﬂuid domain) and in a possibly bounded time interval I ⊂ R,
while the last three inequalities, (4)-(6) apply also in the closure of the ﬂuid
domain Ω ≡ Ω ∪ δΩ. Here the notation is standard. Hence D

is the convective derivative, f(r,t) denotes the volume force density acting on
the ﬂuid element and µ ≡ νρo > 0 is the constant ﬂuid viscosity, ν = µ/ρo
being the related kinematic viscosity. It is assumed that the ﬂuid ﬁelds and
f(r,t) are suitably smooth to belong to the functional setting

Dt = ∂

[where C (i,j)(Ω × I) ≡ C (i,)(Ω) × C (j)I), with i, j ∈ N]. Hence, {ρ, V,p} are

The set of equations (1)-(6), together with (8), will be denoted in the sequel

An inverse kinetic theory for INSE is therefore represented by a kinetic equa-

Γ = Ω × U its closure, while x ≡ (r, v) ∈ Γ and v ∈ U ≡ R3 denote re-
spectively the state and velocity variables. The distribution f (x,t) is assumed
suitably regular (i.e., suitably smooth in Γ×I and summable in Γ) and to obey
appropriate initial and boundary conditions. L(F) is an appropriate operator
(to be denoted as Vlasov streaming operator ). This is deﬁned in such a way
that appropriate velocity moments of (9), are assumed to exist, yield INSE. In
particular, L(F) can be deﬁned in such a way to allow that the inverse kinetic
equation (9) admits, as a particular solution, the local Maxwellian distribution

p1 being the kinetic pressure. Desirable features of the inverse kinetic the-
ory involve the requirement that, under suitable assumptions, the functional
form of the relevant inverse kinetic equation, yielding the INSE equations, be
uniquely deﬁned. In addition, it might be convenient to impose also the valid-
ity of additional ﬂuid equations, such for example the energy equation (8). In
fact, it is well known that the energy equation is not satisﬁed by weak solutions
of INSE and, as a consequence, also by certain numerical schemes. Therefore,
the validity of the inverse kinetic equation yields a necessary condition for the
existence of classical solutions for INSE.

Concerning the ﬁrst point, the prescription of uniqueness on the kinetic equa-
tion has to be intended in a suitably meaningful sense, i.e., to hold under the
requirement that the relevant set of ﬂuid equations are fulﬁlled identically by
the ﬂuid ﬁelds in the extended domain Ω × I. This means that arbitrary con-
tributions in the kinetic equation, which vanish identically under a such an
hypothesis, can be included in the same kinetic equation. Consistently with
the previous regularity assumption, here we intend to consider, in particu-
lar, the requirement that the inverse kinetic equation yields also the energy
equation (8).

In a previous work [2, 3], an explicit solution to INSE has been discovered
based on a continuous inverse kinetic theory, adopting a Vlasov diﬀerential
kinetic equation deﬁned by a suitable streaming operator L. Basic feature of
the kinetic equation is that, besides yielding INSE as moment equations, it

3

allows as particular solution local kinetic Maxwellian equilibria for arbitrary
ﬂuid ﬂuids {ρo, V,p} which belong to the above functional setting (7). How-
ever, as pointed out in [3], the inverse kinetic equation deﬁned in this way
results parameter-dependent and hence non-unique, even in the case of local
Maxwellian kinetic equilibria. This non-uniqueness feature may result as a
potentially undesirable feature of the mathematical model, since it prevents
the possible physical interpretation of the theory (in particular, of the mean-
ﬁeld force F) and may result inconvenient from the numerical viewpoint since
|α| may be chosen, for example, arbitrarily large. Hence it would be highly
desirable to eliminate it from the theory.

The purpose of this paper is twofold.

First we intend to prove that under suitable prescriptions the inverse kinetic
equation can be cast in an unique form, thus eliminating possible parameter-
dependences in the relevant streaming operator [L(F)].This is achieved by
analyzing the form of the streaming operator for particular solutions (local
Maxwellian kinetic equilibria). In this case the the kinetic equation can be
cast uniquely in an equivalent symmetrized form represented by a Vlasov
streaming operator.

As further development of the theory, it is shown that the streaming operator
can be suitably modiﬁed in such a way that the inverse kinetic equation yields
the extended INSE equations, i.e., besides the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations also the energy equation. In particular we intend to prove that the
mean-ﬁeld force F can be uniquely deﬁned in such a way that both kinetic
equilibrium and moment equations yield uniquely such equations.

The scheme of the presentation is as follows. In Sec.2 the inverse kinetic equa-
tion developed in [3] is recalled and the non-uniqueness feature of the mean-
ﬁeld force F is analyzed. In Sec.3 an equivalent representation of the stream-
ing operator is introduced which permits to deﬁne uniquely F. As a result, a
uniqueness theorem is obtained for the streaming operator L(F). Finally in
Sec.4 an extension of the inverse kinetic theory is presented which provides a
solution also for the energy equation, besides the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The formulation of the inverse kinetic equation for the extended
set of ﬂuid equations is obtained by a suitable redeﬁnition of the mean-ﬁeld
force F. Also in such a case the vector ﬁeld F is proven to be unique.

2 Non-uniqueness of the streaming operator

Goal of this Section is to investigate the kinetic equation developed in [3]
to analyze its non-uniqueness features. We start recalling the inverse kinetic

and F(r, v,t; f ) an appropriate vector ﬁeld (mean-ﬁeld force) deﬁned by Eq.(42)
(see Appendix A) in terms of vector ﬁelds F0 and F1. As a consequence,
both F0 and F1are functionally dependent on the form of the kinetic distribu-
tion function f (x,t). In particular, requiring that F depends on the minimal
number of velocity moments (see below), it is deﬁned by Eqs. (42),(43) and
(44), given in Appendix A. Supplemented with suitable initial and bound-
ary conditions and subject to suitable smoothness assumptions for the kinetic
distribution function f (x,t), several important consequences follow [3]:

• the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρo, V,p} can be identiﬁed in the whole ﬂuid domain Ω
with suitable velocity moments (which are assumed to exist) of the kinetic
distribution function f (x,t) [or equivalent

f(x,t)], of the form

p1(r,t) being the scalar kinetic pressure, i.e.,

(I ⊆ R being generally a ﬁnite time interval);

• {ρo, V,p} are advanced in time by means of the inverse kinetic equation

Eq.(9);

• By appropriate choice of the mean-ﬁeld force F, the moment equations can
be proven to satisfy identically INSE, and in particular the Poisson equation
for the ﬂuid pressure, as well the appropriate initial and boundary conditions
(see Ref.[3]);

• The mean-ﬁeld force F results, by construction, function only of the ve-
, to be denoted as extended ﬂuid
locity moments (37), i.e.,
ﬁelds.Here Q and Π are respectively the relative kinetic energy ﬂux (de-
ﬁned in the reference frame locally at rest with respect to the ﬂuid) and the

• The Maxwellian kinetic distribution function fM , deﬁned by the equation
(10), results a particular solution of the inverse kinetic equation (9) if and
only if {ρ, V,p} satisfy INSE.

Let us now prove that the inverse kinetic equation deﬁned above (9) is non-
unique, even in the particular case of local Maxwellian kinetic equilibria, due
to the non-uniqueness in the deﬁnition of the mean-ﬁeld force F and the
streaming operator L(F). In fact, let us introduce the parameter-dependent
vector ﬁeld F(α)

F(α) = F + αu · ∇V−α∇V · u ≡ F0(α) + F1

(24)

where F ≡ F(α = 0), α ∈ R is arbitrary and we have denoted

F0(α) = F0 − α∆F0 ≡ F0a + ∆1F0(α) ,
∆F0 ≡ u · ∇V−∇V · u,
∆1F0(α) ≡ (1 + α)u · ∇V − α∇V · u,

where F0 and F1 given by Eqs.(43),(44). Furthermore, here we have introduced
also the quantity ∆1F0(α) to denote the parameter-dependent part of F0(α).
In fact, it is immediate to prove the following elementary results:

a) for arbitrary α ∈ R, the local Maxwellian distribution (10) fM is a particular
solution of the inverse kinetic equation (9) if and only if the incompressible
N-S equations are satisﬁed;

b) for arbitrary α in R, the moment equations stemming from the kinetic
equation (9) coincide with the incompressible N-S equations;

6

c) the parameter α results manifestly functionally independent of the kinetic
distribution function f (x, t).

The obvious consequence is that the functional form of the vector ﬁeld F0,
and consequently F, which characterizes the inverse kinetic equation (9) is
not unique. The non-uniqueness in the contribution F0(α) is carried by the
term α∆F0 which does not vanish even if the ﬂuid ﬁelds are required to satisfy
identically INSE in the set Ω × I.

We intend to show in the sequel that the value of the parameter α can actually
be uniquely deﬁned by a suitable prescription on the streaming operator (14)
and the related mean-ﬁeld force.

3 A unique representation

To resolve the non-uniqueness feature of the functional form of the streaming
operator (14), due to this parameter dependence, let us now consider again
the inverse kinetic equation (9). We intend to prove that the mean-ﬁeld force
F, and in particular the vector ﬁeld F0(α), can be given an unique repre-
deﬁned by
sentation in terms of a suitable set of ﬂuid ﬁelds
Eqs. (18)-(21) and (22),(23), by introducing a symmetrization condition on
the mean ﬁeld force F0(α).To reach this conclusion it is actually suﬃcient to
impose that the kinetic energy ﬂux equation results parameter-independent
and suitably deﬁned. Thus, let us consider the moment equation which corre-
sponds the kinetic energy ﬂux density G(x, t) = v u2
3 . Requiring that f (x,t) is
an arbitrary particular solution of the inverse kinetic equation (not necessar-
ily Maxwellian) for which the corresponding moment q =
3 f (kinetic
energy ﬂux vector) does not vanish identically, the related moment equation
takes the form

Unlike the lower-order moment equations (obtained for G(x,t) = 1, v,u2/3),
the kinetic energy ﬂux equation contains contributions which depend linearly
on the undetermined parameter α. These terms, proportional to the velocity
gradient ∇V, yield generally non-vanishing contributions to the rate-of-change
of q. The sum of all such terms, which are carried respectively by ∆1F0(α),
v · ∇G(x,t) and the convective term V · ∇Q, reads

Mα(f ) ≡ 2∇· (VQ) − (1 + α)Q·∇V + α∇V · Q.

(30)

which is the contribution to the rate-of-change of q which results proportional
both to Q (the relative kinetic energy ﬂux) and the velocity gradient (either
∇V or V·∇). In order to eliminate the indeterminacy of α, since α cannot
depend on the kinetic distribution function f, a possible choice is provided by
the assumption that Mα(f ) takes the symmetrized form

Mα(f ) = 2∇· (VQ) −

∇V · Q+

Q · ∇V,

(31)

which manifestly implies α = 1/2. Notice that the symmetrization condi-
tion can also be viewed as a constitutive equation for the rate-of-change of
the kinetic energy ﬂux vector. In this sense, it is analogous to similar sym-
metrized constitutive equations adopted in customary approaches to extended
thermodynamics [11]. On the other hand, Eq.(31) implies Mα(f ) = 1
2 Q×ξ,
ξ = ∇ × V being the vorticity ﬁeld. Thus, Mα(f ) can also be interpreted as
the rate-of-change of the kinetic energy ﬂux vector Q produced by vorticity
ﬁeld ξ. From Eq.(31) it follows that F0(α) reads

As a consequence, the functional form of the streaming operator results uniquely
determined. Finally, for completeness, we notice that the same representa-
tion for F0(α) can also be obtained adopting the viewpoint described in
Appendix B. In fact, since α is functionally independent of the kinetic dis-
tribution function f (x, t), it can also be deﬁned in such a way to satisfy a
suitable symmetry condition in velocity-space, which holds in the particular
case f (x, t) = fM (x, t). This is can be realized by requiring that the Vlasov
streaming operator L(F) coincides in such a case with a suitable Fokker-Planck
operator with velocity-independent Fokker-Planck coeﬃcients (see Appendix
B).

Finally, it is interesting to point out that the Vlasov streaming operator L(F)
deﬁned in terms of F0(α = 1
2) results by construction Markovian. Hence, the
position (32) does not conﬂict with the Pawula theorem [7, 8] which yields
a suﬃcient condition for the positivity of the kinetic distribution function f.
The condition of positivity for the kinetic distribution function satisfying the
inverse kinetic equation (9) which corresponds to the deﬁnition (32) for F0(α)
has been investigated elsewhere [4]. In particular by assuming that f results
initially strictly positive and suitably smooth, one can prove that f satisﬁes an
H-theorem both for Maxwellian and non-Maxwellian distributions functions.

As a result of the previous considerations, it is possible to establish the fol-
lowing uniqueness theorem:

THEOREM 1 – Uniqueness of the Vlasov streaming operator L(F)

Let us assume that:

1) the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρ, V,p} and volume force density f(r, V, t) belong to the
functional setting (7);

2) the operator L(F), deﬁning the inverse kinetic equation (9), has the form
of the Vlasov streaming operator (14);

3) the solution, f (x, t), of the inverse kinetic equation (9) exists, results suit-
ably smooth in Γ×I and its velocity moments
deﬁne the ﬂuid
ﬁelds {ρo, V,p} which are classical solutions of INSE, together with Dirich-
let boundary conditions and initial conditions. In addition, the inverse kinetic
equation admits, as particular solution, the local Maxwellian distribution (10);

4) the mean-ﬁeld force F(α) is a function only of the extended ﬂuid ﬁelds
ρo, V,p1, Q, Π
n
5) the vector ﬁeld ∆1F0(α) satisﬁes the the symmetry condition (31).

, while the parameter α does not depend functionally on f (x, t);

o

Then it follows that the mean-ﬁeld force F in the inverse kinetic equation (9)

9

is uniquely deﬁned in terms of

F = F0 + F1,

(34)

where the vector ﬁelds F0 and F1 are given by Eqs. (32) and (44).

PROOF

Let us consider ﬁrst the case in which the distribution function f (x, t) coincides
with the local Maxwellian distribution fM (10). In this case by deﬁnition the
moments Q, Π vanish identically while, by construction the mean mean-ﬁeld
force is given by F(α) [see Eq.()], α ∈ R being an arbitrary parameter.

Let us now assume that f (x, t) is non-Maxwellian and that its moment Mα(f )
deﬁned by Eq.(30) is non-vanishing. In this case the uniqueness of F follows
from assumptions 4 and 5. In particular the parameter α is uniquely deter-
mined by the symmetry condition (31) in the moment Mα(f ). Since by as-
sumption α is independent of f (x, t) the result applies to arbitrary distribution
functions (including the Maxwellian case).

Let us now introduce the vector ﬁeld F′= F+ ∆F, where the vector ﬁeld ∆F
is assumed to depend functionally on f (x, t) and deﬁned in such a way that:

A) the kinetic equation L(F′)f (x, t) = 0 yields an inverse kinetic theory for
INSE, satisfying hypotheses 1-5 of the present theorem, and in particular it
produces the same moment equation of the inverse kinetic equation (9) for
G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1

3u2;

B) there results identically ∆F(fM ) ≡ 0, i.e., ∆F vanishes identically in the
case of a local Maxwellian distribution fM .

Let us prove that necessarily ∆F(f ) ≡ 0 also for arbitrary non-Maxwellian
distributions f which are solutions of the inverse kinetic equation. First we
notice that from A and B, due to hypotheses 3 and 4, it follows that ∆F must
depend linearly on Q, Π − p11. On the other hand, again due to assumption
A the vector ﬁeld ∆F must give a vanishing contribution to the moments the
kinetic equation evaluated with respect to G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1
3u2. Hence, in
order that also F′ depends only on the moments
ρo, V,p1, Q, Π
(hypothesis
4) necessarily it must result ∆F(f ) ≡ 0 also for arbitrary non-Maxwellian
o
distributions f.

4 Fulﬁllment of the energy equation

As a further development, let us now impose the additional requirement that
the inverse kinetic theory yields explicitly also the energy equation (8).

We intend to show that the kinetic equation fulﬁlling such a condition can
be obtained by a unique modiﬁcation of the mean-ﬁeld force F ≡ F0(x,t) +
F1(x,t), in particular introducing a suitable new deﬁnition of the vector ﬁeld
F1(x,t) [Eq.(44), Appendix A]. The appropriate new representation is found

As a consequence, the following result holds:

THEOREM 2 – Inverse kinetic theory for extended INSE

Let us require that:

1) assumptions 1-3 of Thm.1 are valid;

2) the mean-ﬁeld F is deﬁned:

with F0 and F1 given by Eqs. (32) and (35).

Then it follows that:

F = F0 + F1,

(36)

A) {ρ, V,p} are classical solutions of extended INSE in Ω × I [equations (1)-
the Maxwellian distribution function fM (10) is a
(6) and (8)] if and only if
particular solution of the inverse kinetic equation (9);

B) provided that the solution f (x,t) of the inverse kinetic equation (9) exists in
Γ×I and results suitably summable in the velocity space U, so that the moment
equations of (9) corresponding to the weight-functions G(x,t) = 1, v,E ≡ 1
3u2
exist, they coincide necessarily with extended INSE.

11

C) the two representations (44) and (35) for F1 coincide identically

PROOF:

A) The proof is straightforward. In fact, recalling Thm.1 in [3], we notice that
Eqs. (35) and (44) manifestly coincide if and only if the energy equation (8)
is satisﬁed identically, i.e., if the ﬂuid ﬁelds are solutions of extended INSE.

B) The ﬁrst two moment equations corresponding to G(x,t) = 1, v are man-
ifestly independent of the form of F1, both in the case of Maxwellian and
non-Maxwellian distributions, i.e., (35) and (44). Hence, in such a case Thm.3
of [3] applies, i.e., the moment equations yield INSE. Let us consider, in par-
ticular, the third moment equation corresponding to G(x,t) = 1

Invoking Eqs. (32) and (35) for F0 and F1, Eq.(14) reduces to

p1∇ · V = 0

if and only if the energy equation (8) is satisﬁed. Since by construction p1 > 0,
this yields the isochoricity condition (3).

C) Finally, since thanks to A) {ρ, V,p} are necessarily classical solutions of
INSE, it follows that they fulﬁll necessarily also the energy equation (8). Hence,
(44) and (35) coincide identically in Γ × I.

We conclude that (32) and (35) provide a new form of the inverse kinetic
equation applying also to non-Maxwellian equilibria, which results alternative
to that given earlier in [3]. The new form applies necessarily to classical so-
lutions. Since weak solutions (and hence possibly also numerical solutions) of
INSE may not satisfy exactly the energy equation, the present inverse kinetic
theory based on the new deﬁnition given above [see Eq.(44)] for the vector
ﬁeld F(x,t) provides a necessary condition for the existence of strong solu-
tions of INSE. The result seems potentially relevant both from the conceptual
viewpoint in mathematical research and for numerical applications.

5 Conclusions

In this paper the non-uniqueness of the deﬁnition of the inverse kinetic equa-
tion deﬁned by Ellero and Tessarotto (see [3]) has been investigated, proving
that the mean-ﬁeld force F characterizing such an equation depends on an
arbitrary real parameter α. To resolve the indeterminacy, a suitably sym-
metrization condition has been introduced for the kinetic energy ﬂux moment

12

equation. As a consequence, the functional form the mean-ﬁeld force F which
characterizes the inverse kinetic equation results uniquely determined.

Finally, as an additional development, we have shown that, consistently with
the assumption that the ﬂuid ﬁelds are strong solutions of INSE, the mean-
ﬁeld force can be expressed in such a way to satisfy explicitly also the energy
equation.

The result appears signiﬁcant from the mathematical viewpoint, the physical
interpretation of the theory and potential applications to the investigation of
complex ﬂuids, such as for example those treated in [5, 9]). In fact, it proves
that the inverse kinetic theory developed in [3] can be given an unique form
which applies to classical solutions of INSE.

6 Appendix A: relevant velocity moments and mean-ﬁeld force

Here we recall for completeness the expressions of the velocity-moments of the
kinetic distribution function and of the mean-ﬁeld force F given in [3]. The
relevant moments are of the form

G(x, t) being the weight functions G(x, t) = 1, v,u2/3, u u2/3, u u. In partic-
ular, we identify the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρ ≡ ρo, V,p} with

M(G) =

d3vG(x, t)f (x,t),

Z

ρo =

d3vf (x,t),

V(r,t) =

(38)

(39)

(40)

p(r,t) = p1(r,t) − Po,
Po being a strictly positive real constant deﬁned so that the physical realiz-
ability condition p(r,t) ≥ 0 is satisﬁed everywhere in the closure of the ﬂuid
domain Ω. Finally the expression of the mean-ﬁeld force reads:

(41)

F(x,t; f ) = F0(x,t; f ) + F1(x,t; f ),

7 Appendix B: Fokker-Planck representation

It is interesting to point out that the choice of the parameter α = 1/2 and
of the mean-ﬁeld force F0(α) (32) can be obtained also by requiring that the
Vlasov streaming operator (14) results ”equivalent” to an appropriate Fokker-
Planck operator (i.e., that it yields an inverse kinetic theory for INSE which
admits local Maxwellian equilibria).

Since by assumption the parameter α does not depend functionally on f (x, t) it
is suﬃcient to impose its validity only in the case of local Maxwellian equilibria
fM . In such a case, it is possible to require that there results identically

to the Vlasov operator L(F). There results

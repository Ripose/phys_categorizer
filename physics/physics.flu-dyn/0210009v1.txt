Abstract

Transient growth due to non-normality is investigated for the Taylor-Couette problem with

counter-rotating cylinders as a function of aspect ratio η and Reynolds number Re. For all

Re ≤ 500, transient growth is enhanced by curvature, i.e.

is greater for η < 1 than for η = 1,

the plane Couette limit. For ﬁxed Re < 130 it is found that the greatest transient growth is

achieved for η between the Taylor-Couette linear stability boundary, if it exists, and one, while

for Re > 130 the greatest transient growth is achieved for η on the linear stability boundary.

Transient growth is shown to be approximately 20% higher near the linear stability boundary

at Re = 310, η = 0.986 than at Re = 310, η = 1, near the threshold observed for transition

in plane Couette ﬂow. The energy in the optimal inputs is primarily meridional; that in the

optimal outputs is primarily azimuthal. Pseudospectra are calculated for two contrasting cases.

For large curvature, η = 0.5, the pseudospectra adhere more closely to the spectrum than in a

narrow gap case, η = 0.99.

INTRODUCTION

2

Two shear-driven ﬂows bear the name of Couette: the ﬂow between diﬀerentially rotating

concentric cylinders is called cylindrical Couette ﬂow, or more commonly, Taylor-Couette ﬂow,

while the ﬂow between inﬁnite parallel plates translating at diﬀerent velocities while maintaining

a constant separation is called plane Couette ﬂow. Exact solutions, both called Couette solutions,

to the Navier-Stokes equations for each of these conﬁgurations are easily calculated and serve as

illustrations in most textbooks. Each of these two ﬂows has become a paradigm of hydrodynamic

stability theory.

Taylor-Couette ﬂow can be considered to be a paradigm of understanding. In 1923, Taylor

[1] carried out calculations of the linear instability of Couette ﬂow to the onset of axisymmetric

vortices and compared these with experiment, obtaining agreement which remains remarkable

even by today’s standards.

In later research, increasingly ornate and beautiful experimental

patterns were discovered, e.g.

[2, 3, 4], and correspondingly elaborate numerical, asymptotic,

and theoretical calculations, e.g. [5, 6, 7], reproduced and explained these patterns, again with

remarkable accuracy; see [8, 9, 10, 11].

Plane Couette ﬂow, on the other hand, can be considered to be a paradigm of mystery. For

plane parallel ﬂows, Squire’s theorem [12] ﬁrmly establishes that the linear instability with the

lowest critical Reynolds number is spanwise invariant. Armed with this theorem, researchers

have long known, and more recently proved [13], that plane Couette ﬂow is linearly stable

at all Reynolds numbers. Yet, in laboratory experiments [14] and in numerical simulations

[15], plane Couette ﬂow undergoes sudden transition to three-dimensional turbulence. Since at

least the 1960’s researchers have explored various mechanisms for transition in plane Couette

ﬂow which bypass linear instability and Squire’s theorem. An element shared by all of these

approaches, independent of the theoretical mechanism proposed for instability, is the presence

of streamwise vortices [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], i.e. perturbations which, unlike those deemed critical

by Squire’s theorem, are not spanwise invariant, but are instead invariant or almost invariant in

the streamwise direction. These are analogous to the Taylor vortices which, in Taylor-Couette

ﬂow, are the eigenvectors responsible for the linear instability and are realized in experiments

and in nonlinear numerical simulations.

One major line of research has focused on the eﬀect of the non-normality of the operator

governing the linear stability of plane Couette ﬂow [17, 18, 19]. Such operators may lead to

3

transient growth dynamics, even in the absence of linear instability, allowing nonlinear eﬀects

to take over before the ﬁnal exponential decay exhibited by the linear evolution. Plane Couette

ﬂow can exhibit transient growth of several orders of magnitude; the initial conditions which

maximize the transient growth, called optimal perturbations, contain streamwise vortices. Tran-

sient growth is closely associated with the sensitivity of the spectrum to small perturbations of

the operator, quantiﬁed by the pseudospectra [18].

The concepts of pseudospectra, non-normality, transient growth, and optimal perturbations,

have been rarely applied to Taylor-Couette ﬂow [21, 22], probably because conventional linear

stability analysis is so successful in explaining the transitions observed. However, the large

parameter space of Taylor-Couette ﬂow oﬀers the possibility of tuning the system from a nor-

mal operator, which does not support any transient growth, to a highly non-normal operator.

Because of translational and Galilean invariance, plane Couette ﬂow depends only on the dis-

tance 2d between the plates, the relative velocity 2∆U of the plates, and the kinematic viscosity

ν, which are combined into a single nondimensional parameter, the Reynolds number deﬁned

conventionally as Re ≡ ∆U d/ν.

In contrast, because of curvature eﬀects in Taylor-Couette

ﬂow, both the inner and outer radii rin and rout (or gapwidth 2d = rout − rin and average

radius ¯r = (rin + rout)/2) play a role. Because transformation to a rotating reference frame

would introduce a Coriolis term into the equations, the ﬂow depends on the angular velocities

of both the inner and the outer cylinders, Ωin and Ωout. The ﬁve dimensional parameters can

be combined into three non-dimensional parameters in various ways. Our choice is η ≡ rin/rout,

µ ≡ Ωout/Ωin, and Re ≡ rinΩind/ν.

The idea of trying to approach the stability of plane Couette ﬂow via Taylor-Couette ﬂow is

an appealing one and has inspired a number of investigations. The axisymmetric Taylor-vortex

solution undergoes a secondary bifurcation to a non-axisymmetric wavy-vortex solution [2, 6]. In

a search for states intermediate in complexity between the Couette solution and turbulent plane

Couette ﬂow, Nagata [23, 24] took the limits of a narrow gap and almost corotating cylinders

and discovered that, while the Taylor-vortex solution ceases to exist as the Coriolis term (i.e.

the average angular velocity) is decreased, the wavy-vortex solution could be continued to the

plane Couette limit. Faisst & Eckhardt [25] showed that these wavy solutions also exist for

counter-rotating cylinders and that the lowest Reynolds number at which they ﬁrst appear (via

a saddle-node bifurcation) becomes independent of the rotation ratio as η → 1. Finally, Prigent

and Dauchot [26] have discovered that an analog of the spiral turbulence state of Taylor-Couette

4

ﬂow also exists for plane Couette ﬂow.

Our investigation goes somewhat in the opposite direction. While the investigations cited

above considered steady or traveling states known to exist in Taylor-Couette ﬂow and continued

them to the plane Couette limit, we take the ideas of pseudospectra, non-normality, transient

growth, and optimal perturbations, apply them to Taylor-Couette ﬂow and investigate the limit

as Taylor-Couette ﬂow approaches plane Couette ﬂow. We focus on a given representative

azimuthal and axial wavenumber and explore the stability characteristics of counter-rotating

Taylor-Couette ﬂow for a range of Reynolds numbers and radius ratios.

In a related study,

Meseguer [22] studied transient eﬀects – optimized over azimuthal and axial wavenumbers –

for a speciﬁed radius ratio and varying Reynolds number and angular velocity ratio. Since

Taylor-Couette ﬂow is linearly stable for Ωin = 0, Meseguer suggests that transient growth

plays an important role in the transition to turbulence observed experimentally [2] for Ωin = 0,

−Ωout ≫ 1, a theory contested by Gebhardt & Grossman [21].

Why calculate transient growth in Taylor-Couette ﬂow, one of the major success stories of

linear stability theory? Transient growth is a new tool in linear stability theory, whose worth

and longevity have yet to be proved. It has up to now been applied to ﬂows in which transition

from the basic laminar state is not understood. It is therefore worthwhile to calculate transient

growth in Taylor-Couette ﬂow, in which transition is believed to be completely understood by

hydrodynamicists. This could provide information about the value and signiﬁcance of transient

growth calculations. The other side of the coin is that the paradigmatic status of Taylor-Couette

ﬂow should be maintained. As new tools or measurements become available, they should be

brought to bear on this basic ﬂow in order for hydrodynamicists to extract additional knowledge

about Taylor-Couette ﬂow.

A. Taylor-Couette ﬂow

The Couette solution is the unique solution of the form U = UC (r)eθ to the incompressible

U (r = ¯r − 1) = 1,

U (r = ¯r + 1) =

η

.

Distances have been nondimensionalized by (rout − rin)/2 and velocities by rinΩin. We recall

that

η ≡ rin/rout, µ ≡ Ωout/Ωin, Re = rinΩin(rout − rin)/(2ν)

(2)

where rin, rout, Ωin, Ωout are the inner and outer cylindrical radii and angular velocities, respec-

tively, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. Deﬁnition (2) of Re, chosen for compatibility with the

plane Couette convention for the case µ = −1, diﬀers by a factor of two from the conventional

deﬁnition employed in Taylor-Couette ﬂow. The average radius is ¯r = (1 + η)/(1 − η). Thus,

the limit η → 1 corresponds to ¯r → ∞; we refer to either of these limits as convenient.

The Couette solution is:

UC(r) = Ar +

B
r

,

A =

µ − η2
2η(1 + η)

,

B =

2η(1 − µ)
(1 − η)(1 − η2)

.

The expressions for A and B again diﬀer from the standard ones by factors of two due to our

use of (rout − rin)/2 as unit of length. Expression (3) can be viewed as a superposition of solid

body rotation, Ar, and the ﬂow due to a point vortex, B/r. As η → 1, the leading terms of

these two contributions become equal and opposite: Ar ∼ −B/r ∼ (µ − 1)¯r/4. For η ∼ 1, we

therefore rewrite (3) in the following equivalent form not subject to this cancellation error:

UC(r) =

1
4r¯r(¯r − 1)

The Taylor-Couette geometry and the Couette solution are homogeneous in the azimuthal (θ)

and axial (z) direction, which are analogous to the streamwise (x) and spanwise (z) directions in

plane Couette ﬂow. Table II A summarizes the equivalence of the coordinate systems for plane

Couette and Taylor-Couette ﬂow. Solutions to (6) which are spatially bounded are therefore

trigonometric in each of these directions, with wavenumbers m and β,

(ur, uθ, uz, p) = (ˆur, ˆuθ, ˆuz, ˆp)(r, t) exp(imθ + iβz).

(6)

The parameter space is too vast to permit full exploration. In this study, we limit ourselves

to µ = −1, m = 0, and β = π/2. We choose µ = −1 so that the average angular velocity

vanishes.

The choice m = 0 of axisymmetric perturbations is made for simplicity. In plane Couette ﬂow,

the transient growth achieved by streamwise-independent perturbations is, while not maximal,

very close to the optimal value. Although the study of transient growth in Taylor-Couette ﬂow is

relatively unexplored, its linear instability has been extensively studied, e.g. [1, 5, 7, 9, 21]. The

linear instability undergone by Taylor-Couette ﬂow with counter-rotating cylinders is usually

non-axisymmetric and leads to spirals rather than vortices. However, the threshold associated

with axisymmetric perturbations is very close to the actual non-axisymmetric threshold. Indeed,

the thresholds are so close that the instability was thought to be axisymmetric until 1966, when

calculations by Krueger, Gross and DiPrima [5] conﬁrmed experimentally by Coles [2] showed

the ﬁrst instability to be non-axisymmetric for µ suﬃciently negative, more precisely µ . 0.78

in the narrow-gap limit. Note that the correspondence between the streamwise wavenumber α

of plane Couette ﬂow and the azimuthal wavenumber m of Taylor-Couette ﬂow is m ∼ ¯rα, since

x ∼ rθ. Setting m to correspond to a ﬁxed non-zero value of α would thus require increasing m

through integer values as η → 1 or ¯r → ∞.

The choice β = π/2 corresponds to an axial wavelength of 4. Since our choice of length scales

dictates that the radial gap is of width 2, this means that a single vortex has the same axial

as radial extent, i.e.

is approximately circular. The axial wavelength corresponding to linear

instability is somewhat smaller than this for counter-rotating cylinders by as much as 20%, but

is nonetheless close.

We eliminate ˆuz and ˆp by using (6c) and the condition of incompressibility (6d), obtaining

evolution equations in u = (ˆur, ˆuθ). The perturbations (ˆur, ˆuθ) are represented as series of

Chebyshev polynomials in y ≡ r − ¯r, which are evaluated at the Gauss-Lobatto points [27].

The evolution equation is written symbolically for the state vector u = (ˆur, ˆuθ)T as

∂
∂t

u = −i ˆLu.

(7)

The axial velocity component ˆuz is calculated from (ˆur, ˆuθ) via incompressibility.

Our codes for discretizing the Taylor-Couette operator were based on a pseudospectral rep-

resentation of the radial and azimuthal velocity in the inhomogeneous normal direction, similar

to the Matlab code for plane Couette ﬂow written by Reddy [19, 28] and published in [29]. We

tested our Taylor-Couette code in a number of ways. First, we took the limit η → 1 while main-

taining a ﬁxed Reynolds number and veriﬁed that we obtained the same asymptotic growth rates

as in plane Couette ﬂow. We then took η → 1 and veriﬁed that the critical Reynolds numbers

were those obtained by Krueger et al. [5]. Finally, for arbitrary values of η, we veriﬁed that the

critical Reynolds numbers were those given in [8].

As a measure of growth, we use the energy norm deﬁned by:

dr (rf ). The energy norm is particularly signiﬁcant in hydrodynamics, because the
nonlinear terms of the Navier-Stokes equations conserve energy. This lends signiﬁcance to the

|

study of the linearized equations (6), since any energy growth that takes place must occur via

linear mechanisms [29]. The maximal energy growth at time t for u evolving according to (7) is

deﬁned by:

G(t) ≡ sup
u(0)6=0

ku(t)k2
E
ku(0)k2
E

= k exp(−i ˆLt)k2
E .

(9)

Thus the maximal energy growth is given by the energy norm of the operator exp(−i ˆLt).

The norm of a normal operator is its dominant eigenvalue λmax; this is the largest factor

by which matrix multiplication can increase the norm of a vector. For a non-normal operator,

cross-terms between non-orthogonal eigenvectors typically contribute to the norm of a vector.

Instead, it is the singular vectors which are orthogonal; the norm of the operator is given by

the largest singular value σmax. The singular value σmax and its corresponding normalized right

and left singular vectors umax, vmax satisfy:

exp(−i ˆLt)umax = σmaxvmax

(10)

i.e. linear evolution from initial condition umax leads to the state σmaxvmax.

The statements above are all inner-product dependent: an operator is normal or not and

vectors are orthogonal or not with respect to a particular inner product. The singular value

decomposition is inner-product dependent as well. Since we investigate growth in the energy

norm, we seek the largest singular value and its corresponding left and right singular vectors in

the energy norm as well. Standard software, however, provides singular value decompositions

with respect to the 2-norm. Additionally, each of the values on the Gauss-Lobatto grid points

9

must be multiplied by a weight appropriate for calculating the energy (8). We compute the

elements Mij of an N × N Hermitian matrix M by taking the inner products, derived from (8),
between two eigenfunctions Φi and Φj of ˆL. The Cholesky factorization of M = FHF is then

used to convert the energy norm of the operator exponential to an L2-norm of the weighted

matrix exponential according to

k exp(−i ˆLt)k2

E ≈ kF exp(−iDt)F−1k2

(11)

with D as an N ×N diagonal matrix consisting of the eigenvalues of ˆL (see [29] for more details).

We calculate the largest singular value (under the 2-norm) of the operator on the right-hand-side

of (11). Its square is the maximal energy growth. The number N of eigenfunctions has been

chosen large enough to ensure converged results.

The optimal growth is deﬁned as

Gmax = sup
t≥0

G(t).

(12)

If ˆL has an eigenvalue with positive imaginary part, then kuk grows exponentially in time (for

any norm) and so Gmax = ∞. Thus calculations of optimal growth are meaningful only for

operators which are linearly stable.

We also wish to keep track of the quantities responsible for achieving the maxima in (9) and

(12). The time for optimal growth tmax is that which achieves the maximum (sup) in (12), i.e.

Gmax = G(tmax). The optimal input, denoted by u(0), is the normalized initial condition which

achieves the maximum (sup) in (9) for t = tmax. The optimal output, denoted by u(tmax), is

the velocity ﬁeld resulting from the linearized Taylor-Couette evolution (7) starting from the

unit-energy optimal input u(0); its energy gain is Gmax.

A non-normal operator L is also characterized by its pseudospectra [18].

The ǫ-

pseudospectrum Λǫ(L) is the set of complex values z (parametrized by ǫ) which satisﬁes the

property:

k(zI − L)−1k ≥ ǫ−1

(13)

Equivalent deﬁnitions of the ǫ-pseudospectrum are given in [18, 19, 28, 29, 30]. The deﬁnition

of the pseudospectra, like that of transient growth, depends on the norm or inner product. For

10

(14)

a normal operator, the ǫ-pseudospectrum is the union of the balls of radius ǫ surrounding each

eigenvalue. For a non-normal operator, on the other hand, the ǫ-pseudospectrum may be much

larger.

Kreiss’ theorem relates the optimal growth and the pseudospectra by the following inequality:

Gmax ≥ sup

ǫ−1

sup
z∈Λǫ(L)

Im(z)

.

!

ǫ>0  

The right-hand-side of (14) maximizes (over all strictly positive values of ǫ) the ratio of the

distance to the real axis of any point in the ǫ-pseudospectrum Λǫ to the value of ǫ. In practice, it

is found, both for Taylor-Couette ﬂow and for plane channel ﬂows, that the optimal growth given

by the left-hand-side of (14) is approximately twice the lower bound given by the right-hand-side

For computing the optimal growth, we used the Matlab code written by Reddy [19, 28], given

in [29]. For computing the pseudospectra, we used the code EigTool written by Wright [31],

which in turn makes use of the algorithm developed by Trefethen [30] and is available at website

http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/projects/pseudospectra.

III. RESULTS

We begin by presenting the optimal growth as a function of η and Re. We recall that

throughout our study, we ﬁx the azimuthal wavenumber m = α = 0, the axial wavenumber

β = π/2, and the angular velocity ratio µ = −1. Figure 1 shows the contours of constant

optimal growth Gmax. Inside the shaded region, Couette ﬂow is linearly unstable to axisymmetric

perturbations. The boundary of this region is the critical Reynolds number ReL(η). ReL → ∞

as η → 1, as expected since plane Couette ﬂow is linearly stable for all Reynolds numbers. We

may also consider the rightmost portion of the linear stability boundary as a function ηL(Re).

A striking feature is that the maximum growth for a ﬁxed Reynolds number, indicated by

the triangles in ﬁgure 1, is always achieved for a radius ratio η = ηopt(Re) which is less than

one. We propose a possible explanation for this trend. As we decrease the radius ratio η, the

asymptotic growth rate, i.e. the imaginary part of the least stable eigenvalue, increases. At

the same time, the non-normality of the operator decreases, resulting in diminished transient

growth. The combination of these eﬀects results in a maximum growth rate that is achieved

for values of η less than one. We see that ηopt ≈ 0.6 for Re = 20, increases to a maximum of

ηopt ≈ 0.96 for Re ≈ 110, and then abruptly decreases and terminates by meeting the linear

instability boundary ηL ≈ 0.9 at Re ≈ 130. For Re > 130, the maximum growth is achieved for

η = ηL(Re). The enlargements in ﬁgure 2 show the typical behavior of the contours of Gmax

for Re near 130 and for Re near 300. For Re ≤ 130, the optimal growth is fairly weak, varying

from a factor of 1 to 21. Arbitrarily high values of Gmax can be attained by increasing Re, since
for plane Couette ﬂow, i.e. η = 1, it is known [19] that Gmax ∼ Re2. In fact, over the range

300 < Re < 310, Gmax is approximately 20% higher for η = ηL than for η = 1. In this range,

the Gmax contours are nearly vertical as they approach the linear instability boundary, meaning

that Gmax is far more sensitive to a decrease in η than to an increase in Re. It is near Re = 310

that plane Couette ﬂow undergoes a sudden unexplained transition to turbulence. Table II gives

selected numerical values of Gmax.

We now study in detail two contrasting cases: η = 0.5, Re = 125 and η = 0.99, Re = 350.

In the ﬁrst case, η = 0.5 or equivalently ¯r = 3, curvature obviously plays an important role.

The second case, η = 0.99 or equivalently ¯r = 199, is very near the plane Couette limit. The

Reynolds numbers have been chosen to be close to the linear instability threshold ReL in each

case in order to maximize transient growth while remaining within the linearly stable region.

uθ. The meridional velocity ﬁelds consist of vortices whose axes are oriented in the azimuthal

direction, similar to the eigenvectors which lead to Taylor vortices at slightly higher Reynolds

numbers and to the streamwise vortices which are the optimal inputs in plane Couette ﬂow. The

azimuthal components of the optimal inputs and outputs, shown in the lower portions of ﬁgures

3 and 4, are in phase opposition with the vortices, with nodal lines at z = 1, 3 going through

the vortex centers.

Figure 5 shows the evolution in time of the energies in the meridional components Er,z and

in the azimuthal component Eθ starting from the optimal input u(0). While the optimal inputs

u(0) are concentrated primarily in the meridional components, it is the azimuthal component

which dominates the optimal outputs u(tmax). For this reason, in order to show the qualitative

geometric features of the two ﬁelds, the inputs and outputs of Figures 3 and 4 use diﬀerent scales

for the arrow lengths and for the contour levels. This evolution corresponds to the generation of

streaks – deformations of the azimuthal velocity proﬁle – by the vortices. This physical process,

referred to as the lift-up mechanism, has been described, e.g., in [32] and is believed to be a key

element in the transition to turbulence in plane Couette ﬂow.

The graph on the left of ﬁgure 5 shows the evolution of Eθ and Er,z starting from the optimal

input u(0) and from the least stable eigenvector for η = 0.50, Re = 125. The initial energies are

Eθ(0) = 0.2 and Er,z(0) = 0.8. Initially, over 0 ≤ t ≤ tmax ≈ 5, Eθ rises while Er,z decreases,

attaining values of Eθ(tmax) ≈ 4 and Er,z(tmax) ≈ 0.1, with a ratio Eθ/Er,z(tmax) ≈ 40. Over

the interval 5 ≤ t ≤ 8, Er,z increases, while Eθ continues to decrease. With further evolution,

approximately maintained as both energies slowly decrease during the evolution of u(t) towards

the least stable eigenvector.

In the case η = 0.5, Re = 125, two arrays of vortices are present in the optimal input, a larger

and stronger array near the inner cylinder and a smaller and weaker array near the outer cylinder.

unstable where (rUC )2 is a decreasing function of r.

Three arrays are present in the optimal output, whose radial extent and strength decreases in

going from the inner to the outer cylinder. In the case η = 0.99, Re = 350, the optimal input

contains one array of vortices and the optimal output contains a second weaker, narrower array

near the outer cylinder. Some light can be shed on the form of these perturbation ﬁelds and

on the diﬀerence between the two cases by Rayleigh’s criterion for instability in Taylor-Couette

ﬂow.

Rayleigh’s argument, valid for inviscid and axisymmetric ﬂow, is that perturbations inter-

changing rings of ﬂuid at diﬀerent radii (e.g. Taylor vortices) will be favored or opposed by the

ambient pressure gradient, according to whether the square of the angular momentum (rUC)2

decreases or increases radially outwards. For counter-rotating cylinders (µ < 0), the sign of

d(rUC)2/dr changes within the gap. Rayleigh’s criterion is then applied to argue that only the

inner portion of the gap is unstable. This modiﬁcation is justiﬁed by three related tendencies

[9]. First, the unstable eigenvector is concentrated near the inner cylinder, where d(rUC)2/dr is

negative. Second, the axial wavelength corresponding to the most unstable or least stable eigen-

vector decreases, favoring vortices which remain closer to circular. Third, the critical Reynolds

number for linear instability increases, meaning that the critical Reynolds number based on the

unstable portion of the gap remains nearly constant.

Figure 6 shows that the square of the angular momentum decreases radially outwards over

the interval r . ¯r − 0.5 for η = 0.50 and over the interval r . ¯r for η = 0.99. Although exact

application of Rayleigh’s criterion would lead to optimal perturbations far more concentrated

near the inner cylinder than they actually are, the criterion provides a heuristic explanation

for the asymmetry. Rayleigh’s criterion is usually invoked to explain linear instability,

i.e.

exponential growth. However, a modiﬁed version of the criterion should apply to transient

growth as well.

19

Finally, we show the spectrum and pseudospectra of the operators L for the two cases in

ﬁgure 7. Both pseudospectra plots contain contours (for the smaller values of ǫ) surrounding

individual eigenvalues and bulb-shaped contours (for the larger values of ǫ) surrounding the

entire spectrum. For both values of η, the contours for a ﬁxed small value of ǫ surrounding the

eigenvalues near the real axis are wider than the contours surrounding the eigenvalues farther

from the real axis. The bulb-shaped contours, however, diﬀerentiate between the two values of

η. The spectrum for η = 0.5 contains eigenvalues near the real axis with real parts extending

to approximately ±0.7; a bulb-shaped pseudospectral contour thus remains a fairly constant

distance from the spectrum. The spectrum for η = 0.99 is, in contrast, quite localized on the

imaginary axis; in this case, a bulb-shaped pseudospectral contour protruding into the unstable

half-plane is a ﬁrst indication of non-normal eﬀects.

We use more detailed calculations of the pseudospectra to compute approximations to the

lower bound (14) on optimal growth of Kreiss’ theorem. For η = 0.5, we obtain an upper

bound Im(z) ≤ 0.1 for the ǫ-pseudospectrum with ǫ = 10−1.15, which yields the lower bound

Gmax ≥ (101.15 ×0.1)2 = 1.99, about half of the exact value Gmax = 4.17 that we have calculated.
For η = 0.99, we obtain an upper bound Im(z) ≤ 0.03 for the ǫ-pseudospectrum with ǫ = 10−2.45,

which yields the lower bound Gmax ≥ (102.45 × 0.03)2 = 71.49, again about half of the exact

value of 155.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the pseudospectra and optimal transient growth for Taylor-Couette ﬂow.

Our major result is that, for a ﬁxed Reynolds number, the optimal transient growth is

achieved for a radius ratio η = ηopt < 1, rather than for the plane Couette limit η = 1. This is

due to the combined eﬀect of increasing modal growth and decreasing non-normality. As shown

in ﬁgure 1, for Re < 130, the optimal transient growth for ﬁxed Re occurs at an intermediate

value of η ranging from ηopt = 0.6 at Re = 20 to ηopt = 0.96 at Re = 110. For Re > 130, the

optimal transient growth for ﬁxed Re increases as η is decreased from the plane Couette limit

η = 1 to the linear stability boundary η = ηL, as shown in ﬁgure 2.

If transient growth on the order of Gmax ≈ 100 is suspected to initiate transition in plane

Couette ﬂow near Re = 300, then transition should also occur near Re = 300 outside the linear

20

instability domain in Taylor-Couette ﬂow, albeit in very narrow gaps (η & 0.986).

If these

predictions fail to hold, then theories concerning transition initiated by transient growth must

be modiﬁed or even abandoned. Another possible direction for future studies concerns regions

of (η, Re) in which transient growth competes with linear instability; such situations should be

included in a comprehensive theory of transition initiated by non-normal eﬀects.

Two cases have been considered in detail: η = 0.99, Re = 350 and η = 0.5, Re = 125. Both

show transient growth. As could be expected, the case η = 0.99, Re = 350, shows much higher

transient growth, both because of its greater resemblance to plane Couette ﬂow and also because

of its higher Reynolds number. As shown in ﬁgure 5, for η = 0.99, Re = 350, energy grows from

the optimal input by a factor of Gmax = 164, while for η = 0.5, Re = 125, we have Gmax = 4.

As is the case for plane Couette ﬂow, the physical mechanism accompanying transient growth

consists of the conversion of vortices (here, termed azimuthal rather than streamwise) into

streaks, i.e. perturbations of the basic Couette proﬁle. This is seen in the ratio of azimuthal

to meridional energy in ﬁgure 5 of the optimal inputs u(0) and outputs u(tmax). The optimal

outputs, depicted in ﬁgures 3 and 4, are of higher amplitude near the inner cylinder, especially

in the case η = 0.5, Re = 125, as indicated by Rayleigh’s criterion for centrifugal instability

illustrated in ﬁgure 6.

Although both sets of pseudospectra in ﬁgure 7 show signs of non-normality, those for η =

0.99, Re = 350 show more deviation from the spectrum than those for η = 0.5, Re = 125.

Our study is restricted to the azimuthal wavenumber m = α = 0, axial wavenumber β = π/2

and angular velocity ratio µ = −1. Previous results on Couette ﬂows lead us to believe that

these values of (α, β) may be representative of a fairly large portion of parameter space, since

both the maximal optimal growth rate in plane Couette ﬂow and the maximal linear growth

rate in Taylor Couette ﬂow are close to those achieved for α = 0, β = π/2. Varying µ, however,

leads to major qualitative changes, as it does in other aspects of Taylor-Couette ﬂow. Studies

encompassing a wide range of parameter values [22] are clearly desirable.

In the words of Faisst & Eckhardt [25], Taylor-Couette ﬂow provides an ”embedding” of

plane Couette ﬂow. Numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have extensively docu-

mented the way in which plane Couette ﬂow changes as its single non-dimensional parameter,

the Reynolds number, is increased. Taylor-Couette ﬂow provides an ensemble of other param-

eter paths along which to approach or to step back from plane Couette ﬂow. Our hope is

that this preliminary study and that of [22] of transient growth and pseudospectra in Taylor-

Couette ﬂow, will help to increase understanding of both Taylor-Couette ﬂow and of the eﬀects

21

of non-normality.

We investigated numerically the relation between a roller
and the pressure distribution to clarify the dynamics of the
roller in circular hydraulic jumps. We found that a roller
which characterizes a type II jump is associated with two high
pressure regions after the jump, while a type I jump (without
the roller) is associated with only one high pressure region.
Our numerical results show that building up an appropriate
pressure ﬁeld is essential for a roller.

As can be easily observed in a kitchen sink, a circu-
lar hydraulic jump is formed when a vertical liquid jet
impinges on a horizontal surface. The schematic ﬁgure
of the circular hydraulic jump can be shown as in Fig.
1. The phenomenon has been investigated by many re-
searchers through various approaches [1–11].

In some experiments, the depth on the outside of the
jump can be controlled by varying the height of a circular
wall d, as shown in Fig. 1. Experimental results show
that a circular hydraulic jump has two kinds of steady
states which can be reached by changing d [7]. When d
is small or 0, a type I jump is formed, as shown in Fig.
1(a). On increasing d the jump becomes steeper until a
critical dc is reached. If d becomes larger than dc, the
liquid outside of the jump topples. Then another steady
state, a type II jump, is formed as shown in Fig. 1(b).
The eddy on the surface in a type II jump, a secondary
circulation, is usually called a “roller.” The existence of
a roller distinguishes the two types of jumps.

The roller is a common and important feature for many
hydraulic phenomena. Recent experiments [9,10] demon-
strate that various regular polygonal jumps can develop
from a circular jump by controlling the height of the outer
circular wall, and that all those polygonal jumps are as-
sociated with rollers. Rollers are also observed in the
channel ﬂows and are useful for dissipating the excess
energy of high velocity ﬂows, such as from sluice gates
and spillways [3]. It is widely recognized that rollers play
an important role in hydraulic engineering.

However, theoretical studies concerning the formation
and evolution of the roller in a hydraulic jump are lim-
ited because of the largely deformed interface. Some the-
oretical studies have been proposed using a hydrostatic
assumption in the vertical direction. Some reasonable re-
sults have been obtained for the ﬂows of type I jumps [8].

However, a type II jump appears to be beyond the regime
that this vertical-assumption theoretical model is able to
deal with. Numerical modeling has also been used to in-
vestigate the circular hydraulic jump problem. Due to
the diﬃculties in the numerical treatment of largely dis-
torted interfacial ﬂows, the free boundary of the liquid
surface was treated as the ﬁxed boundary of a prescribed
shape [7].

In our previous work [11], numerical simulations on cir-
cular hydraulic jumps were conducted using some newly
developed numerical schemes for multi-ﬂuid ﬂows. We
investigated the transition from a type I jump to a type
II jump. Non-hydrostatic pressure distributions in the
gravitational direction were observed in our simulations.
In our studies, we call ‘dynamic pressure’ the net amount
of the pressure resulting from extracting the hydrostatic
pressure from the actual pressure. We found that the
dynamic pressure around the jump, which has been ne-
glected in most of the theoretical studies to date, is im-
portant for the transition. In a type I jump, a steeper
jump is always associated with a higher wall height ( [7]
and Fig. 3). Thus, as d is increased, the curvature of
the interface immediately after the jump becomes larger,
then the surface tension is strengthened, because the sur-
face tension is proportional to the curvature. In order to
counteract this surface tension and keep the jump sur-
face steady, a larger rise in pressure is required (Figs.4
(a,b)). If the wall height is increased over the critical dc,
the reverse pressure gradient generated by the dynamic
pressure becomes stronger than the ﬂow from below and
a transition occurs.

In this Rapid Communication, we intend to clarify the
relationship between the roller and the pressure ﬁeld.
The simulation results show that the single high dynamic
pressure region in a type I jump becomes two regions af-
ter the transition to a type II jump. These two high
pressure regions are located along the jump slope around
the outer edge Rout and the inner edge Rin of the roller.
This pressure distribution appears important to the ﬂow
separation at the outer edge of the roller and then essen-
tial to the maintenance of a roller.

The governing equations, including eﬀects of gravity,

viscosity and surface tension can be written as

where ρ is the density, u the velocity, p the pressure, g the
gravitational acceleration, µ the viscosity coeﬃcient, Fsv
the surface tension force, and e the inner energy. Both
the liquid and the gas are assumed to have an equation
of state in the form of a polytropic gas, but with quite
diﬀerent sound speeds (large for the liquid phase).

The numerical model is constructed based on the C-
CUP (CIP-Combined, Uniﬁed Procedure) method [12],
the level set method [13,14] and the CSF (Continuum
Surface Force) model [15]. By using the C-CUP method
to solve multi-ﬂuid ﬂows, we are able to deal with both
the gas and the liquid phase in a uniﬁed framework, and
explicit treatment of the free boundary and interfacial
discontinuity is not needed.

The interface between the liquid and the gas is tracked
using the level set method with the CIP (Cubic Interpo-
lated Propagation) method [16] as the advection solver.
A density function φ generated from the level set func-
tion of the level set method by the Heaviside function
can be set as φ = 1 for the liquid and φ = 0 for the air.
The density function is then used to deﬁne the physical
properties, such as sound speed and viscosity for diﬀerent
materials.

The surface tension force is modeled as a body force
Fsv calculated by the gradient of the density function,
Fsv = σκ∇φ, where σ is the ﬂuid surface tension coef-
ﬁcient and κ the local mean curvature. κ is computed
from κ = −(∇ · n), where n is the outgoing unit normal
vector to the interface and is evaluated from the level set
function [14].

An axis-symmetric model has been constructed to deal
with the circular hydraulic jump. The conﬁguration of
the simulation model on an r-z plane is shown in Fig.
2. This calculation model is validated by comparing the
computed results with the scaling relation [6,11].

Simulations were carried out with diﬀerent heights of
the outer circular wall d. The volume ﬂux of the inﬂow is
Q = 5.6 ml/s and the viscosity of the liquid is νl = 7.6 ×
10−6 m2/s. The steady surface proﬁles for the various
wall heights are shown in Fig. 3. The three lower proﬁles
are type I jumps, and the two upper proﬁles are type II
jumps. We observe that the jump becomes steeper as the
wall height increases for a type I jump, while for a type
II, the slope of the jump appears less steep than that
of type I with a high wall hight. These are consistent
with the experimental results [7]. The roller is usually
a consequence of a steepened jump, while its occurrence
always leads to the destruction of the steepness.

The dynamic pressure distributions of the second, the
third and the fourth proﬁles from the lowest were plotted
in Figs. 4(a-c). For the cases of type I (Figs. 4(a,b)), a
high pressure region (referred to hereafter as the primary

2

high pressure) dominating a wide region under the jump
surface is observed. In a type II jump, two high pres-
sure regions are developed around the inner side of the
jump (referred to as the primary high pressure) and the
outer side of the jump (refereed to as the secondary high
pressure) as shown in Fig. 4(c). This pressure distribu-
tion is essential for the roller. We observe that the high
pressure on the outer side of the jump (the secondary
high pressure) coincides with the separation point of the
ﬂow, as shown in Fig. 4(d). This secondary high pres-
sure continuously provides a pressure gradient force to
maintain the upper reverse ﬂow for the roller. The sec-
ondary high pressure is associated with the surface ten-
sion. In the steady state of the type II, the liquid surface
appears convexly curved around the secondary high pres-
sure region or the outer edge of the roller (Figs. 4(c,d)).
This feature of the free surface around the outer edge of
the roller is also observed in experiment [7]. To coun-
teract the surface tension caused by this curved surface
the small curvature and keep a steady surface, the sec-
ondary high pressure must be required. The reverse ﬂow
from the separation point moves down along the jump
surface until it meets another high pressure (the primary
high pressure) on the upstream side of the jump. The
ﬂuid motion is decelerated when it approaches the high
pressure on the inner side of the jump. The direction of
motion is then changed, and joins the main stream again
around the conﬂuent point Rin.

We further simulated the disappearance process of a
roller (the transition process from a type II jump to a
type I jump) to study the details of the relation between
the pressure ﬁeld and the roller. We started from the
steady state of a type II jump (the fourth proﬁle from
the lowest in Fig. 3). Its surface proﬁle is shown as the
topmost one in Fig. 5. The time of this initial state was
set t = 0. We simulated until the steady state of a type I
jump (the second proﬁle in Fig. 3) was reached by lowing
the wall height at t = 0. Fig. 5 displays the surface pro-
ﬁles at diﬀerent instants. The ﬂow experienced a transi-
tion from a type II jump to a type I jump. The evolution
of the dynamic pressure ﬁeld and the maximum value of
the secondary high pressure are shown in Fig. 6. The
initial pressure distribution is characterized by two high
pressure regions and a roller as discussed above. As time
increases, the secondary high pressure becomes weaker,
and ﬁnally vanishes around 0.55 s. It appears that the re-
duction of the secondary high pressure is associated with
the decline in the curvature of the surface around the
secondary high pressure. Meanwhile, the primary high
pressure does not experience any signiﬁcant change and
ﬁnally becomes to the primary high pressure in the type
I jump. In order to give a quantitative measure for the
roller, we calculated the horizontal width of the roller as
Rr
− Rr
in. Fig. 7 shows the time evolution of the roller
width (Rr
in). With the secondary high pressure
out
abating, the roller width decreased. This process was
signiﬁcantly enhanced after the secondary high pressure
disappeared completely (from 0.55 s) because the pres-

− Rr

out

sure gradient becomes perfectly opposite to the reverse
ﬂow of the roller. Around 0.75 s, the roller disappeared.
With the secondary high pressure and the roller having
abated, the ﬂuid eventually approached the steady state
of a type I jump.

From this study, we have made clear that the existence
of the high dynamic pressure regions and a secondary
high pressure region around the outer edge of a roller are
essential to the maintenance of a roller. The establish-
ment of the high pressure ﬁeld is a result of the balance
among various ﬂuid stresses, and the surface tension ap-
pears to play an important role. The secondary high
pressure provides a driving force to generate a reverse
current beneath the jump surface in a type II jump.

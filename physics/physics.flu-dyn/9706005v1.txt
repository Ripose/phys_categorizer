Abstract

We have calculated the general dispersion relationship for surface
waves on a ferroﬂuid layer of any thickness and viscosity, under the in-
ﬂuence of a uniform vertical magnetic ﬁeld. The ampliﬁcation of these
waves can induce an instability called peaks instability (Rosensweig
instability). The expression of the dispersion relationship requires that
the critical magnetic ﬁeld and the critical wavenumber of the insta-
bility depend on the thickness of the ferroﬂuid layer. The dispersion
relationship has been simpliﬁed into four asymptotic regimes: thick
or thin layer and viscous or inertial behaviour. The corresponding
critical values are presented. We show that a typical parameter of the
ferroﬂuid enables one to know in which regime, viscous or inertial, the
ferroﬂuid will be near the onset of instability.

1 Introduction

It is known since the experiment performed by Cowley and Rosensweig ([1], [2]) that a
normal magnetic ﬁeld has a destabilizing inﬂuence on a ﬂat interface between a magneti-
zable ﬂuid and a non magnetic one. Above the magnetic induction threshold Hcrit, the
initially ﬂat interface exhibits a stationary hexagonal pattern of peaks (Rosensweig insta-
bility). The hexagonal pattern becomes a square pattern above another critical magnetic
induction H ′

crit > Hcrit [3].

In this paper, we want to obtain a general dispersion equation (ferroﬂuid layer of any
thickness and any viscosity under the inﬂuence of a uniform vertical magnetic ﬁeld) by lin-
earizing the equations governing the problem. This allows to calculate the critical values
of the instability: wavenumber and magnetic induction. Nevertheless, linearized equa-
tions are inadequate for the full description of either phenomenon: the symmetry of the
developed wave array (hexagonal or square) and the wave amplitudes may be determined
only from nonlinear equations. It has been treated by Gailitis in 1977 [3]. A generalized
Swift-Hohenberg equation constitutes a minimal model to account for the formation of
hexagons as well as squares. In such an envelope equation, for which the quadratic term
is suﬃciently small, hexagons are to be expected from the modeling [4]. Furthermore,
a weakly nonlinear analysis involves that the dynamics of the patterns depends on their
symmetry [5].
We shall remember previous calculations of dispersion equations in section (1.1) and sec-
tion (1.2) will put in evidence the analogy with the electric case. Indeed, a layer of liquid
metal under a normal electric ﬁeld develops a similar instability of peaks (Taylor cones
[6]). We applied to the magnetic case the previous analyse of Hynes [7] and Limat [8]
for the gravitational ampliﬁcation of capillary waves (Rayleigh-Taylor instability) and of
[9] for the electric ampliﬁcation of capillary waves (Taylor cones)
N´eron de Surgy et al.
[6]. The general dispersion relationship that we obtain in section (3) leads to the fact that
the magnetic induction threshold and the critical wavenumber depend on the thickness
of the ferroﬂuid layer [10]. We derive the asymptotic behaviour in various regimes and

3

give analytical dispersion equations in the case of thick or thin, inertial or viscous layers.
From a general approach, we then recover three previously known results (thick-inertial
[2], thick-viscous [11], thin-viscous [12]) obtained from various approaches. Furthermore,
we give an explicit expression of the critical magnetic induction in the case of a thin layer
of ferroﬂuid: it diﬀers from the one of the thick case. We also demonstrate the inﬂuence of
the ratio lv/lc, where lc is the capillary length and lv the viscous length of the ferroﬂuid:
depending on the value of this ratio, the ferroﬂuid will have a viscous or inertial behaviour
near the onset of the instability.

1.1 Previous approaches

Ferroﬂuids or magnetic liquids are permanent, colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic par-
ticles (100 ˚A) in various carrier solvents. Fluid instabilities can arise with these liquids,
especially surface instabilities. In the case of the peaks instability, the study of the linear
stability of the interface, by Cowley and Rosensweig [1], between an half-inﬁnite and in-
viscid ferroﬂuid of density ρ and the vacuum, with normal modes of perturbation, leads
to the following dispersion relation:

ρs2 =

where s is the growth rate of perturbation, k (the modulus of k) is the horizontal wavenum-
ber, µ is the magnetic permeability of the ferroﬂuid, γ is the interfacial tension ferroﬂuid-
vacuum, H0 the modulus of the normally applied magnetic induction and g the gravita-
tional ﬁeld.
The critical values of the instability are then:

ρg/γ = kc = 1/lc

where kc is the capillary wavenumber.
Above the threshold of linear stability, a broad band of wavenumber is theoretically found
unstable. It is seen from other instabilities that the mechanisms of wavenumber selection
are very complex, including the eﬀects of sidewalls, time-dependent eﬀects in cellular
structures, axisymmetric stucture in the case of Eutectic solidiﬁcation, the nonlinearities
of the problem, etc..[13]. A common choice has been to consider then that one wavenumber
km is selected. This wavenumber corresponds to the maximum growth rate sm of the small
|H=const = 0. This prediction has only
undulations, solution to the following equation ∂ks

cases, the wavenumber remains equal to kcrit above the onset, whatever the symmetry
is or the experimental procedure used to increase the ﬁeld (continuous increase [1], ﬁeld
jumps [14] or alternating ﬁeld [15] at diﬀerent frequencies). This encouraged D. Salin, in
1993, to take into account the eﬀect of the ferroﬂuid viscosity, adapting the Landau and
Lifshitz approach [16]. His result leads to a wavenumber km equal to kcrit, whatever the
ﬁeld is [11]. Simultaneously, N´eron de Surgy et al.
[9] obtain the same result for metal
liquids. As seen above, the experimentally selected wavenumber is not obviously km nor

kcrit [17]. We shall see in section (4.1.3) that the description of the unstable behaviour of
the ferroﬂuid (viscous or not) near the onset can be determined by the value of the ratio
lv/lc. When this ratio approaches zero, an inertial description is actually suﬃcient.

1.2 Analogy with electro-capillary instability

In 1993, G. N´eron de Surgy et al. studied the linear growth of electro-capillary instabilities
in the very general case where the viscosity of the ﬂuid and its thickness are of any value
[9], following the studies of Hynes [7] and Limat [8]. The study of this instability is similar
to our study: an electric ﬁeld that is applied normally to the free surface of a conducting
ﬂuid (mercury, for example) has a destabilizing eﬀect on this interface. In their paper,
they derived the asymptotic behaviour in various regimes and gave dispersion equations
in the case of thin or thick, inviscid or viscous ﬁlms: we present a similar approach for
the magnetic case (but note that substituting E for H in the electric dispersion equations
does not result in the correct magnetic dispersion equations). Furthermore, we note that
the critical electric ﬁeld and the critical wavenumber of the electro-capillary instability
does not depend on the thickness: While E = 0 in the whole layer of mercury, there is
penetration of the magnetic ﬁeld in the ferroﬂuid and the distribution of this ﬁeld obviously
depends on the layer thickness (boundary conditions).

2 Characteristic scales for various asymptotic

regimes

−

We consider an incompressible and viscous ﬁlm of magnetic ﬂuid of density ρ, dynamic
viscosity η, kinematic viscosity ν and magnetic permeability µ, that occupies the space
between z = 0 and z =
a, in the vacuum. The geometry is supposed to be inﬁnite for
both x and y and the medium above and below the ferroﬂuid is also inﬁnite, so that we
consider a two dimensional (x, z) problem (Figure 2).
If we want to introduce the thickness eﬀects, we have to consider a horizontal length scale
lx = λ/2π (with λ = 2π/k), and a vertical length scale lz. The value of lz will be taken as
the lowest value between the ﬁlm thickness a and λ/2π.
For the study of the viscosity eﬀects, we shall introduce the Reynolds number (Re = inertia
forces/viscous forces). The Reynolds number is:

deformation of the interface, v(x, z) the velocity of the ﬂuid, H = H0 + h the perturbed
magnetic induction and n the unit vector normal to the interface where n

We shall now use dimensionless values with capillary scale as reference as seen in Table

Let us consider the parameter ε so that Φ = 1 + ε and the parameter δk, where k = 1 + δk
(δk depending on which wavenumber(s) is (are) actually selected). Near the onset, we
develop the growth rate s(Φ, k) into a series in ε and δk. We found at lowest order in ε
and δk (ε and δk independent):

As seen above, a band of wavenumbers of width ε1/2 near threshold is unstable [13]. This
means that the order of magnitude δk2 is at most ε so we can take s2 to be of order ε.
If km is actually selected, we check that δk2 is of order of magnitude ε2 (which is less
than ε). If the wavenumber selected is k = 1 + √2ε (we remain on the curve of marginal
stability), we have checked that a similar analysis is adequate, by making calculations at
the following order. The validity conditions, at the lowest order, for this regime can be

ables to remain in the viscous regime far enough from the onset. Physical data of various

4.2 Thin ﬁlm

It seems obvious that the thick case is easier to experiment than the thin case. In order to
1.7 mm
stick to an opinion, the typical ferroﬂuid APG 512 A has a capillary length lc ≃
so that for the thin regime, the condition a
lc is quite diﬃcult to experiment. The thin
≪
regime could be easier to attain if we could increase lc and this may be achieved under
microgravity conditions. Typical conditions of microgravity experiments lead to a value of
10−2 g (1 g = 9.81 m/s2) in parabolic ﬂys [18] (lc ≃
17 mm) and 10−6 g in orbital stations
1.7 m). In order to make an experiment, one can choose a value of g that enables
[19] (lc ≃
to have a value of lc large enough but not too much (the distance between the peaks is
also proportional to lc). Brand and Pettit made an experiment with a 8 mm deep layer
on a parabolic ﬂy [20] (As the capillary length of their ferroﬂuid is lc = 15.5 mm in the
low gravity phase of the parabolic ﬂy, they were not actually in thin nor thick regime).

The question arises as to when we can reach the asymptotic value √2 of the ratio H thin
in order to put easily in evidence experimentally the diﬀerence between the asymptotic val-
ues of the critical magnetic inductions. The Langevin’s classical theory has been adapted
to yield the superparamagnetic magnetization relationship between the applied ﬁeld H0
and the resultant magnetization M of the particle collection. For a colloidal ferroﬂuid

constant. When the initial permeability is appreciable, it is no longer permissible to
neglect the interaction between the magnetic moments of the particles ([22], [23], [24])
and equation (9) has to be modiﬁed. We shall consider equation (9) as a good ﬁrst
approximation (while χi is not much larger than unity). This leads to the expression of
the relative magnetic permeability:

6 Conclusion

We get the dispersion relation of a layer of magnetic ﬂuid of any thickness and viscos-
ity, under a uniform vertical magnetic ﬁeld. The critical magnetic ﬁeld and the critical
wavenumber of this instability are found to be thickness-dependent. The dispersion equa-
tion, simpliﬁed into four asymptotic regimes, enables to explicit the expression of the
critical magnetic induction of a thin ﬁlm of ferroﬂuid. Near the onset of the instability,
we show that the behaviour of the ferroﬂuid may be viscous or completely inertial; the
behaviour which is manifested depends on the characteristics of the ferroﬂuid (contained
in the parameter f proportional to ν). In order to put in evidence experimentally the
fact that the critical magnetic induction depends on the thickness, it is better to use a
ferroﬂuid with a low value of the initial susceptiblity χi.

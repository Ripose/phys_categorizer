The Cascade of Circulations in Fluid Turbulence

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Kelvin’s Theorem on conservation of circulations is an essential ingredient of G. I. Taylor’s the-
ory of turbulent energy dissipation by the process of vortex-line stretching. In previous work, we
have proposed a nonlinear mechanism for the breakdown of Kelvin’s Theorem in ideal turbulence
at inﬁnite Reynolds number. We develop here a detailed physical theory of this “cascade of circu-
lations”. Our analysis is based upon an eﬀective equation for large-scale “coarse-grained” velocity,
which contains a turbulent-induced “vortex-force” that can violate Kelvin’s Theorem. We show that
singularities of suﬃcient strength, which are observed to exist in turbulent ﬂow, can lead to non-
vanishing dissipation of circulation for an arbitrarily small ﬁltering length in the eﬀective equations.
This result is an analogue for circulation of Onsager’s theorem on energy dissipation for singular
Euler solutions. The physical mechanism of the breakdown of Kelvin’s Theorem is diﬀusion of lines
of large-scale vorticity out of the advected loop. This phenomenon can be viewed as a classical
analogue of the Josephson-Anderson phase-slip phenomenon in superﬂuids due to quantized vortex
lines. We show that the circulation cascade is local in scale and use this locality to develop concrete
expressions for the turbulent vortex-force by a multi-scale gradient-expansion. We discuss implica-
tions for Taylor’s theory of turbulent dissipation and we point out some related cascade phenomena,
in particular for magnetic-ﬂux in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

The fundamental laws of vortex motion for incompress-
ible inviscid ﬂuids in three space dimensions were formu-
lated by Helmholtz [1]. Starting from the incompressible
Euler equations for an ideal ﬂuid, he showed that vor-
tex lines are material lines and that the ﬂux within any
vortex tube is a Lagrangian invariant. Lord Kelvin [2]
gave an elegant alternative formulation of these laws in
terms of the conservation of circulation, for any closed
loop advected by an ideal ﬂuid. This theorem is equally
valid in any space dimension.

However, all of these results depend upon an implicit
assumption that the solutions of the ﬂuid equations re-
main smooth in the inviscid limit. In this limit, as the
Reynolds number tends to inﬁnity, all smooth, laminar
solutions of the Euler equations are unstable and the
ﬂuid motion becomes turbulent. For inﬁnite-Reynolds-
number turbulent solutions, standard conservation laws
of the ideal Euler equations of motion need not hold. For
example, both experiments [3, 4, 5, 6] and simulations
[7, 8] show that energy is not conserved in turbulent ﬂuids
even in the limit as molecular viscosity tends to zero. The
anomalous rate of energy dissipation in turbulent ﬂuids
was attributed by Onsager [9] to predicted H¨older singu-
larities in the solutions of the inviscid Euler equations. In
particular, he showed that a (spatially-minimum) H¨older
exponent hmin ≤ 1/3 is necessary for an Euler solution to

dissipate energy. See also [10, 11, 12, 13]. The existence
of such near-singularities for turbulent velocity ﬁelds at
high Reynolds number has been conﬁrmed by data from
experiments and simulations [14, 15, 16].

In a previous work [17] (hereafter referred to as “I”) we
considered similar questions for the conservation of circu-
lations by turbulent solutions. In that paper we proved
an analogue of Onsager’s theorem, stating necessary con-
ditions for the anomalous dissipation of circulations by
inviscid Euler solutions. Furthermore, since these condi-
tions are expected to be satisﬁed in turbulent ﬂow, we
conjectured that Kelvin’s Theorem, in its usual form, in-
deed breaks down for the relevant high-Reynolds num-
ber solutions. We termed this phenomenon a “cascade
of circulations.” In a following paper [18] we presented
evidence from direct numerical simulations for the ex-
istence of such a cascade. The purpose of the present
paper is to elaborate further the physical theory of this
phenomenon. In particular, our aims are as follows:

In the remainder of this section of the paper, we shall
discuss some important background information. We
ﬁrst remind the reader of the classical Kelvin Theo-
rem. Next we brieﬂy review some ideas of G. I. Taylor
[19, 20, 21] about the role of circulation-conservation in
the production of energy dissipation in three-dimensional
turbulence. In the second section of the paper we present
our new results. First, we discuss the ﬁltering approach
which is the basis of our theory, and explain its relation to
renormalization-group (RG) ideas and to large-eddy sim-
ulation (LES) modelling of turbulent ﬂows. Second, we
establish exact results for large-scale circulation balance
of low-pass ﬁltered velocity ﬁelds. Third, we explain how
Taylor’s argument can be extended to stretching of ﬁl-

tered vorticity and how this is related to forward cascade
of energy through the inertial range. Fourth, we review
the results from I on the possibility of anomalous dissi-
pation of circulations in the limit of zero ﬁltering length.
Fifth, we point out an interesting analogy between this
cascade of circulations and the phenomenon of phase-slip
in superﬂuids, noting similarities with previous ideas of P.
W. Anderson [22]. Sixth, we discuss the scale-locality of
the circulation-cascade and elaborate a multi-scale gradi-
ent (MSG) expansion for circulation-ﬂux, along the lines
laid out earlier for turbulent stress [23, 24]. Finally, in
the conclusion section we discuss some implications of our
results and various extensions to magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) and geophysical ﬂuid turbulence.

A. Classical Kelvin Theorem

We here brieﬂy review some standard facts about the
conservation of circulations. Let u(x, t) be a smooth
velocity ﬁeld solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equation with viscosity ν

∂tu + (u·∇)u = −∇p + ν △ u, ∇·u = 0
where x ∈ Λ ⊂ Rd, for any integer d ≥ 2. Here p(x, t)
is the so-called “kinematic pressure” (or, thermodynam-
ically, the enthalpy per unit mass). For any closed, ori-
ented, rectiﬁable loop C ⊂ Λ at an initial time t0, one
deﬁnes the circulation

(1)

Γ(C, t) =

u(t)·dx =

ω(t)·dA

(2)

IC(t)

ZS(t)

where C(t) is the loop at time t advected by the ﬂuid
velocity, S(t) is any surface spanning that loop, and
ω(t) = ∇×u(t) is the ﬂuid vorticity. These circula-
tions satisfy the Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem in the fol-
lowing sense:

d
dt

Γ(C, t) = ν

△u(t)·dx.

(3)

IC(t)

E.g., see [25], section §1.6, for the standard derivation. It
is worth observing that the Kelvin theorem for all loops C
is formally equivalent to the Navier-Stokes equation [26].
Indeed, if u(x, t) is a smooth spacetime velocity ﬁeld,
divergence-free at all times t, then equation (3) implies
that

[Dtu(t) − ν △ u(t)] ·dx = 0

(4)

IC

for all loops C at every time t. Here Dtu = ∂tu + (u·∇)u
is the Lagrangian time-derivative and the equation (4) is
derived by applying (3) to the pre-image of the loop C
at initial time t0. By Stokes theorem, equation (4) can
hold for all loops C ⊂ Λ if and only if there exists a
pressure-ﬁeld p(x, t) such that the Navier-Stokes equa-
tion (1) holds locally and also globally, if the domain Λ
is simply connected.

2

In the inviscid limit ν → 0, the circulation is formally
conserved for any initial loop C. The ﬂuid equations in
this limit, the incompressible Euler equations, are the
equations of motion of a classical Hamiltonian system.
They can be derived by the Hamilton-Maupertuis prin-
ciple from the action functional

with the pressure ﬁeld p(x, t) a Lagrange multiplier to
enforce the incompressibility constraint. Here x(a, t)
is the Lagrangian ﬂow map which satisﬁes ˙x(a, t) =
u(x(a, t), t) with initial condition x(a, t0) = a. See
[27, 28] for reviews. This variational principle yields
the ﬂuid equations in a Lagrangian formulation, as
¨x(a, t) = −∇p(x(a, t), t). The Eulerian formulation (1)
(with ν = 0) is obtained by performing variations in
the inverse map a(x, t), or “back-to-labels map”, with
ﬁxed particle positions x. This Hamiltonian system has
an inﬁnite-dimensional gauge symmetry group consist-
ing of all volume-preserving diﬀeomorphisms of Λ, which
corresponds to all smooth choices of initial ﬂuid particle
labels. In this framework, the conservation of the circu-
lations for all closed loops C emerges as a consequence of
Noether’s theorem for the particle-relabelling symmetry
[29]. For reviews, see [27], Section 4 or [28], Section 2.2.

B. Circulation and Turbulent Energy Dissipation

In several papers [19, 20, 21], G. I. Taylor has ar-
gued for the importance of conservation of circulations
in the turbulent generation of energy dissipation at high
Reynolds numbers in space dimension d = 3. We brieﬂy
review his ideas. The simplest version of Taylor’s argu-
ment is based upon the concept of vortex line-stretching.
Consider a vortex tube initially with length L0, cross-
sectional area A0, and vortex strength ω0. Taylor as-
sumed that such a vortex tube at high Reynolds num-
ber will evolve as a material line. Taylor also reasoned
that vortex lines (or any material lines) should tend to
lengthen, on average, under random advection by a tur-
bulent velocity ﬁeld. Thus, at a later time t > t0, the
tube length is typically L(t) > L0. By incompressibil-
ity, the volume V (t) = L(t)A(t) does not change in
time, so that A(t) < A0. Furthermore, Taylor reasoned
by the Helmholtz theorem that the vortex-ﬂux through
the tube, Γ(t) = ω(t)A(t), would not change, so that
ω(t) > ω0. In fact, by this chain of reasoning,

ω(t)/ω0 = L(t)/L0

(6)

and vortex strength increases in direct proportion to line-
length. Because the viscous energy dissipation in the
ω2(t) dV = νω2(t)V0, this
vortex-tube is given by ν
process should lead to a dramatic enhancement of dis-
R
sipation.

However, this argument contains an apparent incon-
sistency. On the one hand, Taylor’s assumptions that
vortex-lines are material lines and that the Kelvin Theo-
rem applies require that the viscosity term in the circu-
lation balance (3) can be neglected. On the other hand,
Taylor retains the viscous dissipation in the energy bal-
ance, arguing, in fact, that it is sizable. It is not at all
clear that it is valid to ignore the viscosity eﬀects in one
place and to keep them in another. Taylor himself recog-
nized the delicacy of his argument. In [20] he presented
this line of reasoning, and then wrote: “When ω2 has
increased to some value which depends on the viscosity,
it is no longer possible to neglect the eﬀect of viscos-
ity in the equation for the conservation of circulation, so
that (10) [our (6)] ceases to be true.” Thus, Taylor as-
sumed that there is some interval of time or some range
of length-scales for which viscous eﬀects can be neglected
in the circulation balance (3). We shall critically review
this assumption below.

In a following paper [21], Taylor tested some predic-
tions of his argument using experimental data for decay-
ing turbulence generated from a wind-tunnel. His analy-
sis was based upon the following equation for production
of enstrophy,

which is an exact consequence of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes dynamics (1) for space-dimension d = 3.
Here Sij = (1/2)(∂ui/∂xj + ∂uj/∂xi) is the strain ma-
trix. Under conditions of space-homogeneity, the average
of the transport term vanishes, so that

A. Filtering Approach

3

To analyze the dynamics in the inertial range, we in-
troduce eﬀective equations that govern the evolution of
the velocity ﬁeld at large length-scales. For any chosen
length ℓ, let

uℓ(x) =

dr Gℓ(r)u(x + r)

(9)

Z

denote the low-pass ﬁltered velocity at scale ℓ, where
Gℓ(r) = ℓ−dG(r/ℓ) is a ﬁlter kernel. We shall assume
that G is positive, smooth, rapidly decaying in space and
with unit integral. Then uℓ satisﬁes an eﬀective equation:

∂tuℓ + (uℓ·∇)uℓ + ∇·τ ℓ = −∇pℓ + ν △ uℓ,

(10)

where pℓ is the ﬁltered pressure and τ ℓ is the turbulent
stress-tensor

τ ℓ = (u u)ℓ − uℓuℓ.

(11)

The ﬁltering operation that we have employed can
be regarded as a “coarse-graining” that eliminates
high-wavenumber modes, as in renormalization-group
methodology [30, 31]. Because of momentum conserva-
tion, the eﬀective renormalized equation can change only
by additional contributions to the stress tensor. This
ﬁltering approach is also the mathematical basis of the
large-eddy-simulation (LES) modeling scheme [32, 33].
In this scheme, the stress tensor is the main unknown
which must be modelled, in order to obtain a closed equa-
tion for computation of the large-scale velocity ﬁeld.

In the inertial-range of turbulent ﬂow the ﬁnal viscosity
term in eq.(10) can be neglected. For example, a fairly
crude estimate based upon the identity

(d/dt)h

|ω|2i = hω⊤Sωi − νh|∇ω|2i

(8)

△uℓ(x) = ℓ−2

dr (△G)ℓ(r)u(x + r)

Taylor’s argument on vortex-line stretching suggests that
(d/dt)h|ω|2i > 0, which can hold if and only if hω⊤Sωi >
νh|∇ω|2i ≥ 0 Thus, enstrophy will be created when the
mean rate of vortex-stretching by the strain is positive
and exceeds the mean destruction of enstrophy by viscos-
ity. In [21], Taylor found from an analysis of wind-tunnel
data that the latter condition holds for an initial range
of time in decaying turbulence.

is kν △ uℓk2 ≤ (ν/ℓ2)(const.)kuk2, where kuk2 =
dx |u(x)|2]1/2 is the L2-norm. If the total kinetic en-
[
ergy per mass E = (1/2)kuk2
2 remains ﬁnite in the limit
R
as ν → 0, then the viscosity term in eq.(10) tends to zero
in L2-norm for any ﬁxed ﬁlter-length ℓ.

There is another form of the eﬀective equation (10)
which is useful. Note that the stress appears only via the
turbulent (subgrid) force fℓ = −∇·τ ℓ [33]. This can be
replaced in (10) using the following elementary identity

II. CIRCULATION CASCADE

where kℓ = (1/2)tr τ ℓ is the turbulent kinetic energy [32]
and

We now turn to an analysis of circulation conserva-
tion in high-Reynolds-number turbulent ﬂow. One ap-
proach would be to directly analyze the ν → 0 limit of
eq. (3). However, we shall pursue a complementary ap-
proach based upon a study of nonlinear transfer in the
inertial range.

fℓ = −∇kℓ + f ∗
ℓ ,

f ∗

is the turbulent vortex force. With this replacement, (10)
becomes

∂tuℓ + (uℓ·∇)uℓ = −∇p∗

ℓ + f ∗

ℓ + ν △ uℓ,

(15)

where p∗
ℓ = pℓ + kℓ is a modiﬁed pressure. Although this
form of the large-scale eﬀective equation leads to more
intuitive results, it is less easy to make sense of math-
ematically. In fact, the vortex force f ∗
ℓ could be badly
ultraviolet divergent in the limit as ν → 0. Notice that
for inﬁnite-Reynolds-number turbulence the velocity u is
believed to be a continuous but non-diﬀerentiable func-
tion, so that the vorticity ω exists only as a distribution.
Therefore, the product u×ω is a priori ill-deﬁned. How-
ever, the vortex force remains well-deﬁned due to the
identity (13), since both fℓ and ∇kℓ make sense as long
as kuk2 < ∞.

B. Circulation-Balance in the Large-Scales

It is natural to inquire about the circulation-balance
for the large-scale eﬀective equation. Let us choose an
oriented, rectiﬁable, closed loop C in space. We deﬁne
Cℓ(t) as the loop C advected by the ﬁltered velocity uℓ.
This deﬁnition makes sense, since the ﬁltered velocity
uℓ is Lipschitz in space, and corresponding ﬂow maps
xℓ(a, t) deﬁned by

(d/dt)xℓ(a, t) = uℓ(xℓ(a, t), t), xℓ(a, t0) = a,

(16)

both exist and are unique (see I). We deﬁne a “large-scale
circulation” with initial loop C as the line-integral

Γℓ(C, t) =

uℓ(t) · dx.

ICℓ(t)

(17)

for ℓ < R = the radius of gyration of the loop C [71]. The
same calculation that establishes the Kelvin theorem, but
using the eﬀective eq.
(10) rather than Navier-Stokes
eq.(1), gives

(d/dt)Γℓ(C, t) =

[fℓ(t) + ν △ uℓ] · dx

(18)

ICℓ(t)

If the Navier-Stokes eq.(1) were driven by an external
body-force f ext, then there would be an additional term
f ext
inside the square bracket in eq.(18). If this external
force is spectrally supported at wavenumbers of order
1/L, then its contribution to the circulation balance is
O(R/L). Thus, the forcing term is negligible for R ≪ L.
Likewise, the viscous term in eq.(18) is negligible for
small viscosity ν and ﬁxed ﬁlter-length ℓ, by an elabora-
tion of the argument given around eq.(12). (A so-called
“trace theorem” can be used to estimate the restriction
of △uℓ to the loop C; see I and [34]).

These remarks show that the nonlinear term from the
subgrid force is the dominant term in the circulation bal-
ance (18) for inertial-range values L ≫ R > ℓ ≫ ηd
(where ηd is a dissipation length-scale determined by the
viscosity ν). If we imagine that the total circulation at all
scales on the loop is conserved, then the line-integral of fℓ
on the RHS of (18) represents a “transfer” of circulation
to subgrid modes at length-scales < ℓ. This motivates

the deﬁnition, for any loop C and ﬁlter length ℓ, of a ﬂux
of circulation

Kℓ(C, t) = −

ℓ (t) · dx (19)
f ∗

IC ℓ(t)

IC ℓ(t)

so that (d/dt)Γℓ(C, t) = −Kℓ(C, t) (up to small correc-
tions from external forcing and viscosity). We have used
identity (13) to justify the equality of the two expres-
sions in the deﬁnition (19). The minus sign has been
introduced so that the signs of the circulation (17) and
the circulation-ﬂux (19) should be positively correlated.
This expectation will be discussed more below.

The “circulation-ﬂux” deﬁned in (19) has the physical
dimensions of work or of torque (per unit mass). Addi-
tional insight into its meaning can be obtained by decom-
posing the turbulent vortex-force (14) into components
perpendicular and parallel to large-scale vortex-lines:

f ∗
⊥ ℓ = σℓ× ˆωℓ,
where ˆωℓ = ωℓ/|ωℓ| and

k ℓ = (f ∗
f ∗

ℓ

· ˆωℓ) ˆωℓ

(20)

σℓ = ˆωℓ×f ∗
ℓ .

(21)

If ˆtℓ is the unit tangent vector to the curve C ℓ(t) and s
is the arc-length parameter, then

Kℓ(C, t) =

σℓ(t)·nℓ ds −

k ℓ(t) · dx (22)
f ∗

IC ℓ(t)

IC ℓ(t)

where nℓ = ˆtℓ× ˆωℓ. Note that the latter vector is normal
both to lines of large-scale vorticity ωℓ and to the loop
Cℓ(t), but it is not generally a unit vector. The ﬁrst term
in (22) can be interpreted as a lateral diﬀusion of vortex-
lines out of the advected loop, where σℓ plays the role
of a transport vector of vortex-lines. The second term in
(22) represents an additional work (or torque) due to the
parallel component of the turbulent vortex-force.

Some particular cases of (22) are of special interest.
For example, consider the case that Cℓ(t) is instanta-
neously a closed vortex line. (This property will not gen-
erally be preserved in time). Then the ﬁrst term in (22)
k ℓ(t) · dx. Such inte-
f ∗
vanishes and Kℓ(C, t) = −
Cℓ(t)
H
grals play an important role in vortex-reconnection the-
ory [35]. The distinguished vortex lines for which this
integral is extremal drive the reconnection process and
the value of the integral for such lines gives the rate of
reconnection of vortex-ﬂux. This integral is therefore the
proper point of departure for a theory of turbulent re-
connection of large-scale vortex-lines. Another special
case of (22) of interest is when the loop Cℓ(t) lies in a
transversal surface normal to the lines of large-scale vor-
ticity. In that case, the second term in (22) vanishes and
σℓ(t)·ˆnℓ ds, where ˆnℓ = ˆtℓ× ˆωℓ is now
Kℓ(C, t) =
a unit vector. This condition is always satisﬁed for space
dimension d = 2. The ﬂux of circulation is then entirely
due to the diﬀusion of vortex-lines out of the loop.

C ℓ(t)
H

These remarks on physical interpretation of Kℓ(C, t)
lead to some natural guesses on the correlation of its

sign with that of the circulation Γℓ(C, t). The latter can
be written as

C. Stretching of Large-Scale Vorticity

Γℓ(C, t) =

ωℓ(t)·dA,

ZSℓ(t)

(23)

where Sℓ(t) is any smooth surface spanning the loop
Cℓ(t) and with orientation consistent to that of Cℓ(t)
(by the righthand rule). If the circulation (23) is positive,
then there is a net contribution from vortex lines thread-
ing the loop in the direction of the surface unit normal.
If the eﬀect of the turbulence is “diﬀusive” on average,
then one would expect that the vortex-force will tend to
smooth out the excess of positive-sign vorticity thread-
ing the loop. Thus, according to the sign convention of
the deﬁnition (19), we can expect that Kℓ(C, t) will also
tend to be positive and to reduce the overall magnitude
of the large-scale circulation. Of course, this argument
works equally well when Γℓ(C, t) has negative sign. We
may therefore expect that there is in general a “forward
cascade” of circulations, and that the magnitude of the
large-scale circulation, of whatever sign, will tend to be
decreased by the small-scale turbulence. This reasonable
result has been conﬁrmed by numerical results in [18].

An interesting exception is the inverse-energy cascade
for d = 2 turbulence. For space dimension d = 2, the
enstrophy Ω(t) = (1/2)|ω|2 is an inviscid invariant and
its ﬂux to unresolved scales < ℓ is measured by

Zℓ = −∇ωℓ·σℓ,

(24)

where ωℓ is the ﬁltered vorticity (perpendicular to the
plane) and σℓ is the vorticity transport vector deﬁned in
(21). See [36, 37, 38]. From (24) one can see that enstro-
phy will cascade forward to small scales when vorticity
transport tends to be “down-gradient” and ∇ωℓ·σℓ < 0.
On the other hand, enstrophy ﬂux will be inverse to large-
scales when the vorticity transport is “up-gradient.” In
d = 2 there are expected to be two inertial cascade
ranges, the direct enstrophy cascade where the mean
enstrophy ﬂux is positive and the inverse energy cas-
cade where the mean energy ﬂux is negative [39, 40].
However, there is also some “leakage” of energy ﬂux
and enstrophy ﬂux into the opposite ranges (e.g.
see
[36, 41]). In particular, the mean enstrophy ﬂux in the
inverse energy cascade range is negative, or toward larger
scales. This means, according to (24), that the vorticity
transport in that range is, on average, “up-gradient” or
“anti-diﬀusive”. Therefore, our argument for the sign
of circulation-ﬂux is reversed.
In the inverse cascade
range, a loop containing an excess of one sign of vortic-
ity should tend to accumulate more vorticity of the same
sign. Thus, in the d = 2 inverse energy cascade range
there should be also an “inverse cascade of circulations”
[72].

5

We have seen that the “large-scale circulations”, in the

inertial range, evolve according to the equation

(d/dt)Γℓ(C, t) =

f ∗
ℓ (t) · dx.

(25)

IC ℓ(t)

The term on the righthand side due to the vortex-force
need not be negligible. Thus, Taylor’s conjecture that
Kelvin’s theorem should hold in the inertial range, even
In the next
approximately, is far from obviously true.
section we shall explore this question mathematically, to
the extent possible. Here we discuss some physical im-
plications of Taylor’s conjecture, if true.

If we suppose that the inertial-range circulations are
conserved, then Taylor’s argument about vortex line-
stretching can be repeated for ﬁltered vorticity, implying

(d/dt)h|ωℓ|2i > 0.

(26)

This result can also be understood from the equation
for the ﬁltered vorticity, obtained by taking the curl of
equation (15) (with ν = 0):

∂tωℓ + (uℓ·∇)ωℓ = (ωℓ·∇)uℓ + ∇×f ∗
ℓ .

[Compare with [42], eq.(51), for ν → 0.] Notice that the

This equation is an exact inertial-range analogue of equa-

stretching and the second term represents enstrophy
ﬂux to length-scales < ℓ. For freely decaying turbu-
lence at early times, Taylor’s argument predicts that

is positive and the enstrophy transfer term negative,
with the net enstrophy production positive. At later
times a quasi-equilibrium should be established so that

It was observed in [43] that the energy ﬂux Πℓ to un-
resolved scales < ℓ can be expressed approximately in
terms of the negative skewness of ﬁltered strain and the

This expression is the ﬁrst term in a systematic “multi-
scale gradient expansion” [24]. It follows from an identity
of Betchov [44] that for any homogeneous turbulence

Sℓωℓi.

(32)

Thus, the energy cascade will be forward to small scales
when the mean rate of vortex-stretching is positive. This
is an inertial-range version of Taylor’s mechanism [20,
21].

D. Anomalous Conservation of Circulation

We now consider the question whether Kelvin’s The-
orem can hold, in any sense, in turbulent ﬂow at high
Reynolds number. In view of equation (18) or (25), we
must estimate the magnitude of the circulation-ﬂux de-
ﬁned in (19). The following simple identity, observed
in [17], is useful to provide an estimate of the turbulent
subgrid force:

fℓ i(x) =

dr (∂j G)ℓ(r) δui(r; x)δuj(r; x)

(33)

1
ℓ Z

−

1
ℓ Z

dr (∂jG)ℓ(r) δui(r; x)

dr′ Gℓ(r′) δuj(r′; x).

Z

Here δu(r; x) = u(x + r) − u(x) is the velocity-increment
with separation vector r at location x. An upper bound
easily follows that |fℓ| = O(|δu(ℓ)|2/ℓ), where δu(ℓ) is
the maximum magnitude of the velocity-increment for
separation vectors with |r| < ℓ [17].

If the velocity ﬁeld were smooth, then |δu(ℓ)| ∼
(const.)ℓ for small ℓ and the subscale force would van-
ish as ℓ → 0. However, a turbulent velocity ﬁeld does
not remain smooth in the limit as the Reynolds number
tends to inﬁnity.
Instead, theory, simulations, and ex-
periment indicate that the velocity ﬁeld is only H¨older
continuous with exponent 0 < h < 1 :

|δu(r; x)| = O(rh).

(34)

At each point x one refers to the maximal value h for
which (34) holds as the H¨older exponent at that point.
There is a spectrum of such singularities in the ﬂow,
with exponent h occurring on a set S(h) with fractal
dimension D(h). It was pointed out by Onsager [9] that
the smallest exponent hmin must be ≤ 1/3 to explain
non-vanishing energy dissipation in the inviscid limit.
Parisi and Frisch [45] invoked a multifractal spectrum
D(h) of singularities to explain the anomalous scaling of
pth moments of velocity-increments (so-called pth-order

6

structure-functions). Such multifractal spectra of H¨older
exponents have been conﬁrmed by analysis of data from
experiments and simulations [14, 15, 16]. Of course, at ﬁ-
nite Reynolds numbers there are only “near-singularities”
in the inertial-range of scales and the velocity is smooth
in the dissipation range, where eﬀects of viscosity are
important.

From our estimate below eq.(33), we see that |fℓ| =
O(ℓ2h−1) at any point with local H¨older exponent h.
Thus, the circulation ﬂux Kℓ(C, t) will go to zero as ℓ → 0
if the smallest velocity H¨older exponent hmin is > 1/2 and
if also the curve C(t) has ﬁnite length [17]. This is an
exact analogue for circulation ﬂux of Onsager’s result [9]
for vanishing of energy ﬂux when hmin > 1/3. Only a suf-
ﬁciently rough velocity ﬁeld can provide a transport of
vortex lines which is non-vanishing in the limit as ℓ → 0.
However, high Reynolds turbulence in space dimension
d = 3 has a plethora of singularities with exponents
h ≤ 1/2. For example, the most probable exponent h∗
.
= 1/3, very close to the
with D(h∗) = 3 has a value h∗
mean-ﬁeld Kolmogorov value [14, 15, 16]. Furthermore,
the curves Cℓ(t) advected by the large-scale velocity uℓ
are expected to approach a fractal curve C(t) in the limit
as ℓ → 0 [46, 47]. Thus, circulation-ﬂux is not likely
to vanish as the ﬁltering length decreases through the
inertial-range. Numerical simulations of high-Reynolds-
number turbulence for d = 3 conﬁrm this prediction [18].
There is an important subtlety in the formulation
of Kelvin’s theorem for inﬁnite-Reynolds-number turbu-
lence that must be mentioned at this point. Recent
work on an idealized turbulence problem—the Kraich-
nan model of random advection [48]—has shown that La-
grangian particle trajectories x(t), x′(t) can explosively
separate even when x0 = x′
0 initially, if the advecting ve-
locity ﬁeld is only H¨older continuous and not Lipschitz.
See [49]. Mathematically, this is a consequence of the
non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial-value problem,
while, physically, it corresponds to the two-particle tur-
bulent diﬀusion of Richardson [50]. It has been rigorously
proved in [51, 52] that there is a random process of La-
grangian particle paths x(t) in the Kraichnan model for a
ﬁxed realization of the advecting velocity and a ﬁxed ini-
tial particle position. This phenomenon has been termed
spontaneous stochasticity [53] and it is likely that it holds,
not only in the Kraichnan model, but also for singular
solutions of the inviscid Euler equations. If so, then the
advected curves C(t) that appear in the deﬁnition of cir-
culation (2) are likely to be random fractal curves!

If these speculations are correct, then the time-series
of circulations Γ(C, t) are also a stochastic process, for
In [17] we have pre-
a ﬁxed turbulent velocity ﬁeld.
sented some plausibility arguments in favor of the fol-
lowing “martingale property” for this random process of
circulations:

hΓ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′i = Γ(C, t′),

for t > t′.

(35)

Here h·i denotes the expectation over the ensemble of ran-
dom Lagrangian paths and we have conditioned on the

past circulation history {Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′}. Heuristically,

(d/dt)hΓ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′i =

− lim
ℓ→0

hKℓ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′i = 0. (36)

The circulation-ﬂux in (36) is conjectured to average to
zero, due to increasingly rapid oscillations of the vortex-
force f ∗
ℓ around the loop Cℓ(t), as ℓ → 0. See [17]. The
result in (36) has been partially conﬁrmed by the results
of a numerical simulation in [18], providing some support
to the conjecture (35). This “martingale property” is a
statement of conservation of circulations, in a conditional
mean sense.
It is not clear yet whether this weakened
version of the Kelvin theorem is valid and, if so, whether
it suﬃces for Taylor’s vortex-stretching mechanism.

E. Analogy with Phase-Slip in Superﬂuids

It is worth pointing out an analogy of the “circula-
tion cascade” discussed above with another physical phe-
nomenon, the “phase-slip” due to quantized vortex lines
in superﬂuids [22, 54]. Anderson had already discussed
classical analogues of quantum phase-slip in [22], Ap-
pendix B. His starting point was the classical Euler equa-
tions for an incompressible ﬂuid, written as

∂tu = −∇h + u×ω,
(37)
where h = p + (1/2)|u|2 is the enthalpy. Anderson con-
sidered the line-integral of the ﬂuid velocity u along a
stationary curve C connecting two points P1 and P2,
showing that

(d/dt)

u(t)·dx = −∆C h +

(dx×u)·ω.

(38)

ZC

with λ = (1/2)|u|2 − p, rather than (38). The nontrivial
term associated to ﬂow of vorticity across the curve is now
absent and eq.(40) for a closed loop yields the classical
Kelvin Theorem.

Nevertheless, we have found that it is possible for tur-
bulent ﬂow to yield a nontrivial result. In fact, by ﬁlter-
ing the Euler equation (37) one obtains

∂tuℓ = −∇hℓ + uℓ×ωℓ + f ∗
ℓ ,

(41)

with the additional vortex-force term. This equation is
equivalent to

Dtuℓ = ∂tuℓ + (uℓ·∇)uℓ = −∇p∗

ℓ + f ∗
ℓ ,

(42)

which is our old eq.(15) for ν = 0. As we have seen in
our earlier discussion of the large-scale circulation bal-
ance, eq.(18) or (25), the turbulent vortex-force provides
a nontrivial transport of vorticity across material curves.
Here it is crucial that the velocity ﬁeld be suﬃciently sin-
gular, to permit a transport which is non-vanishing for
ℓ → 0. If instead the ﬂow were smooth and laminar, then
f ∗
ℓ → 0 in that limit and ﬁltering the equation would
lead to no new result. For singular solutions the Euler
equation (37) must be ﬁltered to make sense, as a matter
of principle. In the presence of singularities the equation
is interpreted in the sense of distributions, which means
that it must be smeared with smooth test functions.

Nontrivial results are also possible in superﬂuids, for
similar reasons. The superﬂuid phase order parameter
ϕ obeys the Josephson-Anderson frequency equation [22,
54]:

~ dϕ/dt = −(µ +

mu2

s),

(43)

2

Here ∆C h = h(P2) − h(P1) is the diﬀerence of h along
the curve C. Denoting time-average by (·), this relation
yields

where µ is the chemical potential and us = (~/m)∇ϕ
is the superﬂuid velocity. It is straightforward to derive
from (43) the superﬂuid equation of motion

∆C h =

(dx×u)·ω.

ZC

(39)

Dtus = (∂t + us·∇)us = −∇(µ/m) − us×ωs.

(44)

Since vortex lines for smooth solutions of the classical Eu-
ler equations move with the particle velocity u = dx/dt,
the righthand side of (39) can be interpreted as an av-
erage rate of ﬂow of vorticity across the curve C. This
ﬂow rate is thus equal to the average enthalpy diﬀerence
along the curve. After deriving (39), Anderson wrote
[22]: “We see immediately that this equation is far more
important in a superﬂuid, where vorticity is conserved
and quantized, than it is in ordinary ﬂuids, where in a
laminar ﬂow, for instance, the right-hand side has little or
no special signiﬁcance.” One critical diﬀerence between
classical ﬂuids and superﬂuids is that, in the former, the
vortex-lines for laminar solutions move with the ﬂuid.
Thus, if one instead considers a material curve C(t), ad-
vected by the ﬂuid velocity u, then one obtains

(d/dt)

ZC(t)

u(t)·dx = ∆C(t) λ

(40)

Here the ﬁnal term contains the superﬂuid vorticity ωs =
∇×us which is, formally, a delta-function supported on
singular vortex lines (zeroes of the superﬂuid density).
Equation (44) is the basis of derivations of Kelvin’s the-
orem for superﬂuids, e.g. see [55] in the context of the
zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Note, how-
ever, that such derivations require that the advected loop
not pass through singular points where the superﬂuid ve-
locity is ill-deﬁned. Since the quantized vortex lines are
see [56, 57, 58]), it
not material lines in general (e.g.
is possible for them to migrate out of an advected loop.
Examples are given in [55] of the failure of Kelvin’s the-
orem due to the intersection of loops with singularities
that are, formally, represented by the rightmost term in
eq.(44). That equation is thus analogous to eq.(42) for
classical turbulence.

One of the concrete manifestations of quantum phase
slip is the decay of “persistent” superﬂuid ﬂow in a thin

toroidal ring. E.g. see [59] and references therein. This
process has a number of similarities to the “cascade of
circulations” in turbulent ﬂow. The decay of the super-
ﬂow is mediated by the (thermal or quantum) nucleation
of quantized vortices which migrate out of the ring. The
passage of a vortex across the toroidal cross-section in-
duces by phase-slip a pulse of torque which decreases the
circulation around the ring. The reduction in the angular
momentum of the superﬂuid condensate is balanced by
a gain in the normal ﬂuid excitations, acting as an an-
gular momentum reservoir. In the turbulent circulation-
cascade, the large-scale vortex lines are also not mate-
rial, because singularities in the velocity ﬁeld allow them
to diﬀuse relative to the ﬂuid. The subscale modes at
length-scales < ℓ act as a reservoir, whose feedback on the
resolves scales > ℓ provides the vortex-force that drives
the diﬀusion. Unlike in superﬂuids, this is a continuous
process, since classical vortices are not quantized. There
is also no need for the singularities to be nucleated as
ﬂuctuations, since they are everywhere present in the tur-
bulent ﬂow. Finally, if the “martingale” conjecture (35)
is correct, then the turbulent diﬀusion of vortex-lines is
not persistent in scale, on average, and does not lead to
irreversible mean decay of circulations.

F. Scale-Locality and MSG Expansion

We have referred to this turbulent diﬀusion of vorticity
as a “cascade” of circulations, but we have not shown
that the process is a local-in-scale cascade. Here we shall
examine this issue, following the general approach in [23].
We note ﬁrst that the turbulent vortex-force f ∗
ℓ de-
ﬁned in (14) is a priori not ultraviolet (UV)-local, under
conditions realistic for turbulence in d = 3. In fact, the
vorticity is a dissipation-range variable and its largest
contributions come from the viscous scale. The argu-
ments in [23] for UV-locality would apply to f ∗
if the
ℓ
H¨older exponents hu of velocity and hω of vorticity both
were positive. However, hω = hu − 1, so that vortic-
ity is expected to have negative H¨older exponents in the
inﬁnite-Reynolds-number limit (and thus to exist only as
a distribution) [16].
It is possible that there could be
cancellations in the average (14) over displacement vec-
tors that deﬁnes the vortex-force. E.g. this was found to
be true in the d = 2 enstrophy cascade, by an analysis of
the results of a numerical simulation [38]. However, the
UV-divergence is more severe for d = 3, so that suﬃcient
cancellation is less likely there.

On the other hand, because of the identity (13), we
may use the turbulent subscale force fℓ = −∇·τ ℓ rather
than the vortex-force f ∗
ℓ to study the circulation-ﬂux.
The force fℓ has much greater chance to be scale-local, be-
cause it is deﬁned only in terms of velocity. Indeed, some
locality properties follow directly from the representation
(33) in terms of velocity increments. As in [23], let us de-
ﬁne u>∆ = G∆ ∗ u to be the low-pass ﬁltered velocity
at length-scale ∆ > ℓ and deﬁne u<δ = u − u>δ to be

8

(45)

(46)

the high-pass ﬁltered velocity at length-scale δ < ℓ. We
can then deﬁne a very large-scale contribution f >∆
to the
turbulent force by replacing both u in the formula (33)
with u>∆. Likewise, we deﬁne a very small-scale contri-
bution f <δ
by replacing both u with u<δ. Now suppose
that the velocity ﬁeld has H¨older exponent h at a consid-
ered point x. Then, the following estimates can be easily
derived, by the same methods as in [23]:

The estimate (45) expresses infrared (IR)-locality.
In
fact, when h < 1, this estimate shows that f >∆
decreases
for increasing ∆ and ﬁxed ℓ. Relative to the estimate
|fℓ| = O(ℓ2h−1), the estimate (45) for |f >∆
| is smaller
by a factor O((ℓ/∆)2(1−h)). Likewise, the estimate (46)
expresses UV-locality. When h > 0, this estimate shows
that f <δ
decreases for decreasing δ and ﬁxed ℓ. The es-
timate (46) for |f <δ
| is smaller than that for |fℓ| by a
factor of O((δ/ℓ)2h). These results show that most of the
turbulent subgrid force fℓ comes, pointwise, from pairs of
velocity modes at length-scales ∼ ℓ.

The above arguments do not quite settle the issue of
locality of the circulation-ﬂux Kℓ(C, t), however. The
delicate point here is that large cancellations are expected
in the line-integral of fℓ that deﬁnes that ﬂux. In order
to infer scale-locality of Kℓ(C, t), one must assume that
similar cancellations occur in the line integrals of f >∆
and f <δ
. This issue is hard to address mathematically
but may be investigated using data from simulation or
experiment.

The UV-locality properties of the subgrid force fℓ may
be used to develop an analytical expression for it, by
means of a multi-scale gradient expansion [24]. We con-
sider only the lowest-order term in that expansion, which
corresponds to the so-called “nonlinear model” for the
stress [33]:

ℓ

τij = Cℓ2ui,luj,l.

(47)

dr|G(r)|2r2

R

Here C =
1 and a spherically-symmetric ﬁl-
ter function is assumed, so that r1 could be replaced with
any other single component ri. (In terms of the constant
C2 employed in [24], C = C2/d where d is the space di-
mension.) We use the convention of subscript “, j” to
denote ∂j, so that, for example, ui,j = ∂ui/∂xj. We also
employ the Einstein summation convention for repeated
indices. To avoid an excess of subscripts, we drop above
and hereafter the subscript ℓ, since a ﬁxed ﬁlter length
will be always understood. The physical assumption be-
hind the formula (47) is strong UV-locality, so that only
adjacent subscale modes contribute to the stress. We ex-
pect that this extreme assumption is fairly good in the
d = 3 energy cascade and the d = 2 direct enstrophy cas-
cade. However, we present arguments below that it fails

9

badly for the d = 2 inverse energy cascade. Note that it
is already known that the energy transfer is only weakly
scale-local in d = 2 [60, 61, 62].

From the formula (47) for the stress, one obtains the

corresponding formula for the subscale turbulent force:

fi = −∂j

Cℓ2ui,luj,l
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

.

(48)

By means of a standard vector calculus identity, this can
be written for d ≤ 3 as:

to “skew-strain”. That term makes no strongly UV-local
contribution to energy ﬂux but a major contribution to
helicity ﬂux and here we see also to circulation ﬂux.

The second term on the righthand side of (53) corre-
sponds to another term from the MSG expansion in [24],
a contractile stress along vortex-lines, τ vortex
∝ −ωiωj.
As discussed in [24], the eﬀects of the small-scale turbu-
lence give the large-scale vortex-lines “elastic” properties.
The second term in (53) therefore has a simple geometric
interpretation and can be written as

ij

fi = Cℓ2ǫijkuj,lωk,l − ∂i (cid:18)

Cℓ2uj,luj,l(cid:19)

.

(49)

Here ǫijk is the anti-symmetric Levi-Civita tensor for
d = 3. This formula can be simpliﬁed by substitut-
ing uj,l = Sjl − (1/2)ǫjlmωm in the ﬁrst term and
uj,luj,l = Sj,lSj,l + 1

2 |ω|2 in the second, yielding:

fi = Cℓ2ǫijkSjlωk,l − ∂i (cid:18)

Cℓ2SjlSjl(cid:19)

.

(50)

This is our ﬁnal formula for the turbulent force. Sub-
stituting (50) into (19) yields a similar formula for the
circulation-ﬂux:

Kℓ(C, t) = −Cℓ2

ǫijkSjlωk,l dxi.

(51)

ICℓ(t)

According to this formula, the diﬀusion of vortex-lines
out of the loop is driven by strain acting upon the gra-
dient of the vorticity vector. This is plausible, since the
turbulent force should act to smooth out inhomogeneities
in the large-scale vorticity ﬁeld and become negligible
when the latter is constant.

The same result (51) for the circulation-ﬂux can be
obtained from the “nonlinear model” of the turbulent
vortex-force:

i = Cℓ2ǫijkuj,lωk,l
f ∗

= Cℓ2ǫijkSjlωk,l + ∂i (cid:18)

Cℓ2|ω|2

.

(cid:19)

(52)

Although this derivation yields the same result, it is the-
oretically less well-founded because of the poorer UV-
locality properties of the vortex-force. On the other
hand, it gives a little more physical insight, especially
through the following alternative expression for the
vortex-force:

f ∗ = Cℓ2∇·(S×ω) +

Cℓ2(ω·∇)ω.

(53)

Here (S×ω)ji = ǫiklSjkωl deﬁnes what was termed in
[24] the “skew-strain matrix” for d = 3. Formula (53)
is straightfowardly derived by calculating the divergence
(S×ω)ji,j and gathering the terms. This expression
makes a nice connection with the MSG expansion for
the turbulent stress, developed in [24]. The ﬁrst term
on the righthand side of (53) corresponds to one of the
stress contributions in the MSG expansion, proportional

previously considered in [37, 38]. (This formula is equiv-
alent to that for the vortex-force in eq.(55).) Note,
however, that the formula (57) predicts “down-gradient”
transport of vorticity whenever there is a positive rate
of vorticity-gradient stretching and this is expected in
d = 2 both for the direct enstrophy cascade [37, 38] and
also the inverse energy cascade [61, 62]. “Down-gradient”

vorticity transport is qualitatively correct in the enstro-
phy cascade and there (56) may yield a good approxima-
tion. However, in the inverse energy cascade the vortic-
ity transport must be “up-gradient” or “anti-diﬀusive.”
Therefore, (56) is not likely to be a good approxima-
tion in the inverse cascade range. It must be corrected
by higher-order terms in the convergent MSG expansion,
corresponding to smaller subgrid scales or higher-order
gradients.

III. CONCLUSIONS

The main purpose of this paper was to elaborate a
physical theory of “circulation cascade” in classical ﬂuid
turbulence. We have attempted to explain the concep-
tual basis of the phenomenon, its physical mechanisms,
the scale-locality properties of the cascade, and its rela-
tion to inertial-range vortex-stretching and energy trans-
fer. Clearly, there are many important issues that call
for further work. Chief among these is to determine the
validity of G. I. Taylor’s proposed mechanism for turbu-
lent energy-dissipation, based on vortex line-stretching
[19, 20, 21]. Even after seventy years of research, ba-
sic elements of Taylor’s proposal remain open to ques-
tion.
In particular, the strong inertial-range violations
of the Kelvin Theorem—predicted in [17] and observed
in [18]—cast some doubt on a key piece of Taylor’s the-
ory. It is possible that circulation conservation remains
valid in some weaker sense, e.g.
the conditional-mean
version of the “martingale conjecture” in [17]. Further
research is necessary to see whether any weaker form
of the Kelvin Theorem holds at high Reynolds numbers
and, if so, whether it is suﬃcient for the purposes of Tay-
lor’s mechanism. It should be emphasized that even the
existence of circulations in the inﬁnite-Reynolds-number
limit is an open question. Advected loops in a turbulent
ﬂow are expected to become fractal [46, 47] and deﬁn-
ing line-integrals for non-rectiﬁable curves demands some
mathematical sophistication [17]. In superﬂuids the ad-
vected contours in Kelvin’s Theorem can also become
highly distorted, with interesting consequences for vor-
tex motion [58]. Fractality of the advected loops could
have signiﬁcant implications for conservation of circula-
tions in ﬂuid turbulence.

In addition to hydrodynamics of incompressible ﬂuids,
there are other turbulent systems for which phenomena

10

similar to “circulation cascade” are expected to exist. Of
these, one of the most signiﬁcant is magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) turbulence of plasmas. In this case it is
Alfv´en’s Theorem [64] on conservation of magnetic ﬂux
in the ideal, zero-resistivity limit which plays the role
of Kelvin’s Theorem. However, there is strong evidence
from observations of magnetic ﬂux reconnection rates
in astrophysical settings to believe that Alfv´en’s Theo-
rem breaks down in MHD turbulence even with negligi-
ble resistivity [65, 66]. This violation of conservation of
magnetic ﬂux, presumably due to a similar cascade phe-
nomenon as for Navier-Stokes dynamics, is discussed in
a following paper for the MHD equations [67]. Another
important problem is turbulence in geophysical ﬂuids,
where Ertel’s Theorem [68] on conservation of potential
vorticity (PV) plays a fundamental role in theories of
quasi-geostrophy. It is well-known that Ertel’s Theorem
is a diﬀerential form of the Kelvin Theorem (e.g.
see
[69], Section 2.5 or [27], Section 4). The “cascade of cir-
culations” in this context should be quite similar, gener-
ally speaking, to that for two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
and correspond to a turbulent transport of PV out of
the advected loop. However, in geophysical ﬂuid dynam-
ics there is an additional complication that the loop in
Kelvin’s theorem must lie in a surface of constant density
(bouyancy) or pressure [27, 69]. Thus, turbulent mixing
of isopycnal surfaces is an additional source of breakdown
of Kelvin’s Theorem in this context. Finally, another in-
teresting setting for “circulation cascade” is superﬂuid
turbulence [70]. The analogy between quantum phase-
slip and circulation-cascade could prove useful here.

[71] The circulation quantity deﬁned in (17) is mainly of
if ℓ ≫ R, then uℓ is
interest for ℓ < R. Otherwise,
nearly constant over the scale of the loop and |Γℓ(C, t)| =
O(R/ℓ) ≪ 1.

[72] This phenomenon has been previously observed in nu-
merical simulations of the d = 2 inverse energy cascade
(Minping Wan and Shiyi Chen, private communication).

Examining textbooks of thermodynamics we can not able to ﬁnd a proof of
increasing of entropy under free adiabatic expansion in vacuum based on the state
equation of the Van der Waals gas. This communication remedies the situation.

The second law is often deduced in classical thermodynamics as a principle of
increasing of entropy in irreversible adiabatic processes [1]. For example, when a gas
makes a free adiabatic expansion in vacuum its entropy S should increase. This is true
for any gas regardless of its state equation due to the following general formula [2]:

where V is the system volume, U is the internal energy, T is the absolute temperature,
p is the pressure.

In case of the ideal gas this eﬀect can be shown plainly using the ﬁrst law of

thermodynamics

δQ = dU + δA,

where δQ is the heat reseived by the gas from its surroundings, δA is the work of external
forces, which surroundings exert on the gas; the entropy deﬁnition

The integration of equation (3) yields a change of the entropy when the ideal gas

goes from an initial state 1 to a ﬁnal state 2:

∆S = CV ln(

Though equations (2,3) are valid only for reversible processes, equation (4) is
initial and ﬁnal states are thermal

if

apllicable also to non-reversible processes,
equilibrium.

We consider the adiabatic process, and, therefore, Q = 0. Besides, the total system

volume V2 = const, and we get A = 0. Hence, ∆U = Q − A = 0 and for the ideal gas

Using equation (2) and taking into account V2 > V1, we get

∆T =

A more complicate task is to develop the proof of entropy increasing under adiabatic
expansion in vacuum for the Van der Waals gas. The state equaiton of the Van der Waals
gas is written usually as [4]

where Vµ = V

ν is the molar volume, a, b are Van der Waals constants.

Using equations (1,5) we get formulas for changes of the entropy and the internal

energy of the Van der Waals gas [3]:

∆S = Cµ,V ln(

∆U = Cµ,V (T2 − T1) + a(

),

where Cµ,V is the isovolumic molar speciﬁc heat.
Since ∆U = 0, it follows from equation (5):

T2 = T1 − a(Vµ,2 − Vµ,1)
Cµ,V Vµ,1Vµ,2

Using Vµ,2 > Vµ,1, from equation (8) we get T2 < T1, i.e., the Van der Waals gas

always refrigerates under free adiabatic expansion in vacuum.

Substituting equation (8) for T2 in equation (6), we obtain:
∆S = Cµ,V ln(1 − a(Vµ,2 − Vµ,1)
Cµ,V Vµ,1Vµ,2T1

Taking into account Vµ,2 > Vµ,1 > b, we conclude that in equation (9) the second
item is always positive, while the ﬁrst item is always negative. One would think,
that assuming the values of a, b, Vµ,1, Vµ,2 in equation (9) are ﬁxed, we could choose
T1 suﬃciently small, so that the sum (9) becomes negative (or equal to zero). However,
this conclusion conﬂicts with the second thermodynamics law. Probably, our assumtion
is not correct, and we can not vary parameters in equation (9) independently of one
another. Let us prove that.

We begin with an inequality (see equation (6)):

∆S = CV ln(

) + R ln(

From equation (10) it follows that:

Substituting T2 from equation (8) in equation (11), we get:

It remains to note that equations (13) and (14) are equivalent. Because all
transformations from equation (10) to equation (13) are identical, we conclude that
while the Wan der Vaals state equation (5) is valid, equation (10) is true also.

This completes the formal proof of increasing of the entropy of the Wan der Vaals
gas in the inﬁnitesimal process of the free adiabatic expansion in vacuum. The process
with ﬁnite change of the volume can be regarded as an integral sum of corresponding
inﬁnitesimal processes. Hence, any process of free adiabatic expansion in vacuum for
the Wan der Vaals gas is characterized by the entropy increase.

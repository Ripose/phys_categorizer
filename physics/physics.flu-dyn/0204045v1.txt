Velocity and Pressure Fields Induced by Spheres in an

Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev-143, Ukraine 03143

Unbounded Fluid

A S. Usenko∗

(January 11, 2014)

We propose a procedure for the determination of the time-dependent ve-

locity and pressure ﬁelds of an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid in an

external force ﬁeld induced by an arbitrary number of spheres moving and

rotating in it as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the

particles. Within the completely linearized scheme, we express the velocity

and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid in terms of induced surface force densities and

derive the explicit form for all quantities contained in these relations not im-

posing any additional restrictions on the size of particles, distances between

them, and the frequency range. We show the incorrectness of similar results

obtained earlier by several authors because these results are expressed in terms

of nonexistent inverse tensors. We explain the reasons leading to this and pro-

pose a procedure for the elimination of divergent quantities. In the stationary

case, using the proposed procedure, we obtained the translational, rotational,

and coupled friction and mobility tensors for a system containing an arbitrary

number of spheres up to, respectively, the second, forth, and third orders in

the dimensionless parameter equal to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere

to a typical distance between two spheres. In various particular cases, the re-

sults obtained in the present paper agree with the well-known results derived

by other methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

Investigation of hydrodynamic interactions between spheres immersed in an incompress-

ible viscous ﬂuid is of considerable interest for a wide class of problems of physics of suspen-

sions and colloidal crystals. Due to the long-range nature of the hydrodynamic interactions,

their account is essentially important for the study of these systems, for which many-particle

interactions should be taken into account. As a rule, for the study of these interactions, the

linearized Navier–Stokes equation for the ﬂuid is used [1]. Usually, the problem is reduced

to the determination of the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on particles moving and

rotating in it with given translational and rotational velocities. According to the classical

approach used for one particle [2–6], to ﬁnd these forces and torques, ﬁrst, it is necessary

to determine the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid induced by particles moving and

rotating in it. However, in the case of several particles, this problem is extremely compli-

cated. The corresponding exact relations for the forces and torques exerted on particles due

to hydrodynamic interactions between them were derived only for the particular stationary

case of two spheres moving along the line passing through their centers with equal [7] or dif-

ferent velocities [8] and perpendicular to this line and rotating along the axis perpendicular

to the direction of motion of the spheres and the line connecting their centers [9,10].

For this reason, several methods aimed at the determination of approximate solutions

have been developed. Among these methods, there is the well-known classical method of

reﬂections ﬁrst proposed by Smoluchowski for analysis of the forces exerted by the ﬂuid on n

spheres moving in it with constant velocities. Later, this method was used for the solution of

many stationary problems of hydrodynamic interactions of particles (mainly, two particles)

in an incompressible viscous ﬂuid (the detailed review of results is given in [1]) including

also the cases of permeable spheres [11–13] and mixed slip-stick boundary conditions at the

surfaces of the spheres [14–18]. The corresponding results are presented in the form of power

series in the dimensionless parameter σ equal to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to

a typical distance between two spheres calculated to a certain order of this parameter.

2

Since the method of reﬂections and its further modiﬁcations are based on the solution

of the corresponding boundary-value problems, their direct application to the solution of

nonstationary many-particle problems seems to be rather problematical. Moreover, even

in the stationary case, the procedure of determination of the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid

induced by particles becomes essentially more complicated with increase in the number

of particles. For this reason, the methods of reﬂections are usually used for two spheres

in the stationary case.

In [19], Mazur and Bedeaux proposed a new method (called the

method of induced forces) for the determination of the force exerted by the ﬂuid on a

single sphere moving with time-dependent velocity in the case where the ﬂuid moves with

nonstationary and nonhomogeneous velocity. Later, this method was developed for the

determination of the friction [20] and mobility tensors [21] in the case of the stationary ﬂuid

containing an arbitrary number of particles, furthermore, the results for the mobility tensors

were generalized to the nonstationary case [22]. At ﬁnite frequencies, the expressions for

the mobility tensors are obtained up to the third order in two dimensionless parameters,

namely, the parameter σ, which is typical of the stationary case, and the parameter κ,

which is proportional to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to the penetration depth

of transverse waves. The method of induced forces essentially diﬀers from the method of

reﬂections because it is not based on the necessity of the knowledge of the explicit form for

the ﬂuid velocity induced by particles.

Other methods for the solution of problems of hydrodynamic interactions between par-

ticles in the ﬂuid were proposed in [23–29]. Despite the fact that the solution of nonstation-

ary many-particle problems in [25,26] is also based on the introduction of unknown induced

forces, this approach essentially diﬀers from the method of induced forces used in [20–22].

Indeed, within the framework of this approach, the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid

on particles as well as the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid induced by these particles are expressed

in terms of the introduced induced surface forces, the explicit form for which was determined

up to the third order of two dimensionless parameters mentioned above, while the method

of induced forces in [20–22] is developed in such a way that the mobility and friction tensors

3

(not the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid that cannot be found with the use of this method) are

found without determination of the explicit form of the introduced induced surface forces.

However, the ﬁnal results presented in [25,26] are expressed in terms of multiindex tensors,

the explicit expressions for which are not given and that are only deﬁned as tensors inverse

to certain rather complicated multiindex tensors. For this reason, the question of the agree-

ment between the results obtained in [25,26] and [22] is open. Furthermore, this problem

remains unsolved even for the stationary case. Even in the simplest case of a single sphere

rotating with constant angular velocity in a ﬂuid, the ﬂuid velocity followed from the general

relations given in [25,26] is also expressed in terms of the inverse tensor and, hence, cannot

be reduced to the classical result for the ﬂuid velocity induced by a rotating sphere [1,5]

without the knowledge of the explicit form for the inverse tensor.

The aim of the present paper is to develop a method for the solution of various problems

(both stationary and nonstationary) of hydrodynamic interactions between any number of

particles immersed in an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid in an arbitrary force ﬁeld

such that, as opposed to [25,26], the results obtained by this method (the velocity and

pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid induced by these particles, the forces and torques exerted by the

ﬂuid on the particles, various mobility tensors, etc.) coincide with the corresponding results

obtained in particular cases by other methods as well as to explain the reasons that do not

enable one to represent the results given in [25,26,30] in the conventional form.

In Sec. 2, we reduce the problem of n spheres in an unbounded incompressible viscous

ﬂuid in an arbitrary force ﬁeld to an equivalent problem for this ﬂuid without particles in

an eﬃcient force ﬁeld. Unlike the generally excepted procedure of the zeroth extension of

the external force [19,20,23–26] and the ﬂuid pressure [19–22] to the domains occupied by

the particles, we use another extensions for these quantities and discuss possible problems

connected with diﬀerent methods of extensions of the required quantities. We give relations

for the total forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid and force ﬁelds on particles.

In Sec. 3, within the framework of the completely linearized scheme (both with respect

to the ﬂuid velocity and the velocities of the particles), we express the required distributions

4

of the ﬂuid velocity and pressure in terms of the unknown induced surface forces distributed

over the surfaces of the particles. The results are obtained without imposing any additional

restrictions on the size of particles, distances between them, and frequency range. All

required quantities contained in the relations for the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid

are given in the explicit form in terms of special functions of dimensionless parameters. We

derive the system of algebraic linear equations in the unknown harmonics of the induced

surface force densities in Sec. 4.

In Sec. 5, we consider the stationary case. Taking into account the obtained explicit

form of the quantities in the system of algebraic equations, which is similar to the system

given in [30], we solve this system by the method of successive approximations using the

system of noninteracting particles as a zero approximation. In this approximation, we show

that the determinant of the system of equations corresponding to the harmonics with l = 1

is equal to zero. Therefore, the inverse tensor, in terms of which the relations for the forces

and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles given in [30] for the stationary case as

well as analogous results and the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid induced by the particles given in

[25,26] for the nonstationary case, does not exist. We analyze the reasons for this fact and

show that this means that the required induced surface forces can be determined only up to

arbitrary potential components that have no inﬂuence on the ﬂuid velocity. We formulate

the additional conditions that enable one to uniquely determine the induced surface force

densities. Using the proposed procedure, we obtained the translational, rotational, and cou-

pled friction and mobility tensors for a system containing an arbitrary number of spheres up

to the second, forth, and third orders in the dimensionless parameter σ, respectively, which

in various particular cases, agree with the well-known results obtained by other methods.

Within the framework of the considered approach, we formulate an algorithm for the de-

termination of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid as well as the forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on particles corresponding to a given power of the parameter σ. The

details of calculation of several integrals of the products of three and two Bessel functions

necessary for determination of the hydrodynamic interaction tensors are given in Appendix.

and solenoidal F (sol)ext(r, t) components

We represent the external force F ext(r, t) as a superposition of the potential F (p)ext(r, t)

Dirac delta-function, vinf and ρinf are certain constant velocity and pressure at inﬁnity

deﬁned by the condition for the ﬂuid at inﬁnity where the external force ﬁeld is absent.

According to relation (2.7), the ﬂuid velocity is determined only by the solenoidal component

of the external force, which is the natural consequence of the continuity equation (2.2). The

ﬂuid pressure is determined by the potential component of the external force.

Let, in the considered ﬂuid, N homogeneous macroscopic spheres of radii aα and masses

mα, where α = 1, 2, . . . , N, be present. At the time t, the position of the center of sphere α

is deﬁned by the radius vector Rα(t) relative to the ﬁxed Cartesian coordinate system with

origin at the point O (in what follows, the system O). In parallel with this ﬁxed system, we

also introduce N local moving Cartesian coordinate systems with origins Oα at the centers

of spheres coinciding with their centers of mass (in what follows, systems Oα) so that sphere

α does not move relative to system Oα. Therefore, the radius vector r of any point of the

space can be represented in the form r = Rα + rα, where rα is the radius vector of this point

relative to the local system Oα. The motion of the spheres is described by the equations

The problem is to determine the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid induced by

moving particles in it as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles.

For the solution of this problem, we use the method of induced forces proposed in [19] and

developed in [20–22]. We extend the quantities p(r, t), v(r, t), and F ext(r, t) deﬁned in

Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) for rα ≥

aα to the domains rα < aα occupied by the spheres as follows:

(2.16)

(2.17)

We extend the external force ﬁeld F ext(r, t) given for rα ≥

aα to the domains rα < aα

so that in the entire space, it is described by the same analytic expression as in the domain

aα. (For short, we call this extension an analytic extension.) The nonzero extension

rα ≥
of the ﬂuid pressure deﬁned by (2.17) and the analytic extension of the external force ﬁeld

8

diﬀer from the usually accepted zeroth extension of both the ﬂuid pressure [19–22] and the

external force ﬁeld [23–26] to the domains rα < aα. It is worth noting that the considered

problem can be solved for various extensions of the quantities p(r, t) and F ext(r, t) to the

domains rα < aα including the zeroth extension [19–26] and the extensions used in the

present paper. However, the complexity of calculations and the possibility of interpretation

of certain results essentially depend on the speciﬁc method of extension.

If the ﬂuid pressure is extended to the domains rα < aα according to relation (2.17), then

the function p(r, t) deﬁned in the entire space has a discontinuity at the surfaces rα = aα.

For this reason, in what follows, we write the ﬂuid pressure at the point r = Rα + aα as

p(Rα + aα + 0, t).

Note that for the analytic extension of the external force ﬁeld F ext(r, t) to the domains

rα < aα, the ﬁrst two terms in (2.17) represent the pressure of the unbounded ﬂuid without

particles in the external force ﬁeld F ext(r, t). In the case where the ﬂuid velocity satisﬁes

the stick boundary conditions at the surfaces of the spheres [1,4,5] (this case is considered

in the present paper), condition (2.16) ensures the continuity of the function v(r, t) given

in the entire space at rα = aα.

In [24–26], the external force ﬁeld F ext(r, t) is extended to the domains rα < aα by zero

and the stress tensor P (r, t) in these domains is deﬁned as follows:

div P (r, t) =

∂U α(r, t)
∂t

,

ρ
−

rα < aα.

(2.18)

We note that in the case where the ﬂuid velocity v(r, t) is extended to the domains

rα < aα according to relation (2.16) (in fact, this is used in [24–26]), the stress tensor

P (r, t) for rα < aα must have another analytic representation than (2.3). Otherwise, if the

stress tensor P (r, t) in the domains rα < aα is deﬁned by relation (2.3), where the quantity

v(r, t) is deﬁned by relation (2.16) in these domains, then for rα < aα, we have

P (r, t) = p(r, t)I,

(2.19)

where the quantity p(r, t) for rα < aα depends on the method of extension of the ﬂuid

pressure p(r, t) deﬁned for rα ≥

aα to rα < aα. However, for any extension of the ﬂuid

9

pressure p(r, t) to the domains rα < aα, according to (2.19), the left-hand side of Eq. (2.18)

contains the potential vector ∇p(r, t), while the right-hand side of this equations contains

the solenoidal vector -ρ ∂

∂t ((Ωα(t)

r)) because

(cid:17)

(2.20)

This means that the extension of the ﬂuid velocity v(r, t) to the domains rα < aα according

to (2.16) eliminates the possibility of extension (2.18) (used in [24–26]) for the stress tensor

P (r, t) deﬁned by relations (2.3) in the entire space to these domains for the case of the

time-dependent angular velocity Ωα(t).

The quantities v(r, t) and p(r, t) extended to rα < aα according to (2.16) and (2.17) and

F ext(r, t) analytically extended to these domains are given in the entire space and satisfy

the continuity equation (2.2) and the equation

ρ

∂v(r, t)
∂t

+ div P (r, t) = F ext(r, t) + F ind(r, t)

(2.21)

given in the entire space. Equation (2.21) diﬀers from Eq. (2.1) by the additional term (the

induced force density) F ind(r, t) that appears due to the extension of the linearized Navier–

Stokes equation given for rα ≥
of the external force ﬁeld, the quantity F ext(r, t) in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.21) is described by

aα to the domains rα < aα. For the analytic extension

the same analytic expressions, while, for the zeroth extension of the external force ﬁeld to

rα < aα [19,23–26], the analytic expressions describing the quantity F ext(r, t) in the domains

aα and rα < aα are diﬀerent. Therefore, in the latter case, the procedure where the

rα ≥
quantity F ind(r, t) is formally considered to be equal to zero in Eq. (2.21) is not equivalent

to the removal of the particles from the ﬂuid because Eq. (2.1) given in the entire space and

Eq. (2.21) with F ind(r, t) = 0 describe the unbounded ﬂuid in various force ﬁelds, namely, in

F ext(r, t) and in

the translational velocity U α(t) of particle α, which is caused by the diﬀerent extensions

In view of relations (2.29) and (2.30), the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on

to determine only the forces F α(t) and the torques T α(t) in the linear approximation with

respect to the velocities of the ﬂuid and the spheres, it is convenient to use the procedure

proposed in [20–22], which does not require the explicit form of F (S)ind(r, t). On the basis

of this procedure, for an arbitrary number of spheres in a ﬂuid, one obtains the mobility

tensors of particles that move and rotate in the ﬂuid both in the stationary case [20,21]

and with regard for the time dependence [22]. In a more general case where the velocity

ﬁeld of the ﬂuid should be determined, the problem becomes essentially more complicated

because the explicit form of the induced surface force densities must be obtained. In the

nonstationary case, this problem is considered in [25,26] where the zeroth extension of the

external forces to the domains occupied by spheres is used and the stress tensor in these

domains is deﬁned by relation (2.18).

III. REPRESENTATION OF THE REQUIRED QUANTITIES IN TERMS OF

HARMONICS OF INDUCED SURFACE FORCE DENSITIES

To determine the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid in the presence of N spheres in

it, we note the same structure of Eqs. (2.1) and (2.21). Therefore, we can use solution (2.7),

(2.8) of Eqs. (2.1)–(2.3) with the substitution F ext(k, ω) + F ind(k, ω) for F ext(k, ω).

We consider the problem linearized both with respect to the velocity of the ﬂuid and the

velocities of the spheres. Within the framework of this approximation, we neglect the time

dependence of the positions of centers of the spheres deﬁned by Rα(t) and their surfaces

Sα(t). This means that the spheres do not displace considerably for considered time intervals

(for details, see [22]). This enables us to represent F (S)ind

(k, ω) and F (V )ind

(k, ω) as follows:

Note that for the zeroth extension of the external forces to the domains rα < aα used

in [20,23–26], the interpretation of v(0)(r, ω) as the nonperturbed velocity of the ﬂuid, i.e.,

the ﬂuid velocity in the absence of the spheres, is not a quite correct because, in this case,

v(0)(r, ω) is the velocity of the ﬂuid not containing particles but in the external force ﬁeld

harmonics

(3.19)

where, for short, the symbol

Thus, the problem of determination of the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on

particles is reduced to the determination of only the zeroth and ﬁrst (with respect to l)

harmonics of the induced surface force densities [25,26,30].

For any point of the space, its position deﬁned by the radius vector r relative to the

ﬁxed system O can be represented in the form r = Rα + rα, where Rα is the radius

vector that deﬁnes the position of the center of certain sphere α and rα is the radius vector

directed from this center to the point at hand. Since there are N particles, there exist N

diﬀerent representations for r. Among these representations, in the case where the point

of observation belongs to the domain occupied by the ﬂuid, it is convenient to take rα

corresponding to the minimum diﬀerence rβ −
the minimum distance from the point at hand to the surface of sphere α. If the point of

aβ, where β = 1, 2, . . . , N, which means

observation lies inside the domain occupied by sphere α, then rα is the radius vector directed

from the center of this sphere to this point.

(Rα + rα, ω), where β = 1, 2, . . . , N, are the velocities and the

pressures of the ﬂuid at the point r = Rα + rα induced, respectively, by the surface and

volume forces distributed over the surface and inside the volume of particle β with the center

deﬁned by the vector Rβ. The particular case β = α corresponds to the velocities and the

pressures of the ﬂuid generated at this point, respectively, by the surface and volume forces

distributed over the surface and inside the volume of the particle that is the most closely

situated to this point. This enables us to separate contributions to the induced velocity and

pressure of the ﬂuid caused by the closest particle and more distant ones.

At any point r of the space, we can represent the quantities deﬁned by relations (3.12),

(3.13), (3.15), (3.17), and (3.18) as expansions in the spherical harmonics

(3.58), (3.60) and (3.61) completely determine the function v(r, ω) in the entire space pro-

vided that the induced surface force densities are known. Analogously, relations (2.8), (3.5),

(3.9), (3.11), (3.13), (3.15), (3.25), (3.28), (3.30), (3.33), (3.59), and (3.62) uniquely repro-

duce the original function p(r, ω) at any point of the space with the exception of the points

of the surfaces of the spheres (rα = aα, α = 1, 2, . . . , N) where the obtained quantity is

equal to the half-sum of the original function given at r = Rα + aα + 0 and r = Rα + aα −
aα and (2.17) for rα < aα

and the quantities p(0)(Rα + aα, ω) and pind(Rα + aα, ω) are deﬁned by the corresponding

IV. SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS FOR HARMONICS OF INDUCED SURFACE

FORCE DENSITIES

In the previous section, the required distributions of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of

the ﬂuid as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles were expressed

in terms of harmonics of the induced surface force densities. To determine these harmonics,

we use the stick boundary conditions for the ﬂuid velocity at the surfaces of the particles

Passing in relations (4.1) to the Fourier transform with respect to the frequency and

using representation (3.4) for the ﬂuid velocity, we obtain

V α(aα, ω) = vind(Rα + aα, ω),

α = 1, 2, . . . , N,

(cid:17)

is the velocity of the point rα = Rα + aα of the surface of sphere α relative to the ﬂuid

velocity v(0)(Rα + aα, ω) at this point in the absence of particles in the ﬂuid.

For each α, we expand the quantities in relations (4.2) in the spherical harmonics

Ylm(θ, ϕ) analogously to expansion (3.19) for the induced surface force densities. Note that

representations of the induced velocity and pressure of the ﬂuid in the form (3.24)–(3.28)

are, in fact, the expansions of these quantities in the spherical harmonics Ylm(θ, ϕ) at the

surface of the sphere of an arbitrary radius rα with the center at the point Oα. Therefore,

26

putting rα = aα in relations (3.24), (3.26), and (3.27), we immediately obtain the required

expansion for the quantity vind(Rα + aα, ω) at the surface of particle α in the spherical

harmonics Ylm(θ, ϕ). As a result, we obtain the following system of algebraic equations in

the unknown quantities f β,lm(ω):

are deﬁned, respec-

tively, by relations (3.34), (3.63), (3.31), (3.60), (3.32), and (3.61) for rα = aα.

In the absence of the sum on the right-hand side of Eqs. (4.4) (this sum is absent in the

case of the stationary problem and conservative external ﬁelds), the tensor T β,l2m2

α,l1m1(ω) deﬁnes

harmonic (l1m1) of the expansion of the ﬂuid velocity at the surface of particle α induced by

harmonic (l2m2) of the expansion of the induced surface force density f β(aβ, ω) distributed

over the surface of particle β (another particle if β

= α or the same if β = α). For the

stationary case (ω = 0), these quantities were introduced in [30] and called hydrodynamic

interaction tensors. Their generalization to the nonstationary case was performed in [25,26].

In what follows, we use this terminology. Equations (4.4) agree with the corresponding

equations (3.7) in [26] up to the terms vβ(r)ind

α,l1m1 (ω) and vβ(sol)ind

α,l1m1

(ω), which is caused by

extension (2.18) for the stress tensor mentioned above and the zero extension of the external

forces to the domains occupied by the particles used in [26].

V. STATIONARY CASE

In the previous sections, we reduced the problem of determination of the velocity and

pressure ﬁelds of the unbounded viscous ﬂuid induced by an arbitrary number of spheres

immersed in it to the solution of the inﬁnite system of linear algebraic equations (4.4) in

the harmonics of induced surface force densities f β,lm(ω). In this paper, we consider the

important particular case corresponding to the stationary mode, i.e., all quantities are time

independent.

It is easy to perform the passage to this case using the general relations

obtained above, setting ω = 0 in them, and assuming that all quantities are independent

of ω [for example, vind(r, ω = 0)

vind(r), T β,l2m2

α,l1m1(ω = 0)

Thus, in the stationary case, the ﬂuid velocity caused by the induced volume forces is

determined only by the solenoidal component of the external force ﬁeld. This is quite natural

because, according to (2.24), in the stationary mode,

This enables us to seek a solution of system (5.14) by the method of successive approxima-

tions. As the zeroth iteration, we use system (5.14) with the zeroth right-hand side, which

corresponds to the absence of interaction between the particles (the induced surface force

density on the surface of particle α is determined by the characteristics of the ﬂuid and this

particle and independent of the characteristics of the rest particles). The solution of system

(5.14) in the form of a series, each term of which, in fact, determines the contribution of a

separate iteration to the total solution is given in [30]. Moreover, the ﬁnal result is expressed

in terms of the tensor T β,l2m2

However, the explicit form for the tensor ˜T

α,l1m1 is not given in [30] except for l1 = 0.

Furthermore, it is stated that this tensor always exists due to the uniqueness of the solution

of the Stokes equation. Being the central point for the determination of the solution in [30],

the derivation of the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on particles is based on this

statement. As a result, these forces and torques are also expressed in terms of the inverse

tensor ˜T

α,l1m2
α,l1m1. For this reason, in the present paper, we dwell on the derivation of a similar

by the translational motion of particles, their rotation, and the external force ﬁeld to the

induced velocity and pressure of the ﬂuid as well as to the forces and torques exerted by the

α,1m1 do not exist or they should be deﬁned in another way [23] than by

to interpret the relation for f α,1m obtained in [30] and expressed in terms of the nonexistent
(in the ordinary sense) inverse tensor ˜T

α,1m1. Furthermore, with regard for the interaction

The determinant of system (5.38) is equal to zero.

Indeed, it is easy to see that the

left-hand side of the ﬁrst equation of system (5.38) is equal to the sum of the left-hand sides

of the second and third equations of this system. For the consistency of system (5.38), the

right-hand sides of the equations of this system must satisfy the following condition:

(5.45)

Furthermore, relations (5.44) and (5.45) are also true in the general nonstationary case

where ω

= 0 including any values of rα and not only for rα = aα.

Therefore, system (5.38) and, hence the original system (5.34), has an inﬁnite number

of solutions instead of a single solution as it is stated in [30].

This result is quite natural. Indeed, the problem of determination of f α,lm with the use

of boundary conditions (4.1) means that we try to represent the unknown induced surface

force densities f α(aα) in terms of the known ﬂuid velocity at the surfaces of the particles.

According to the continuity equation (2.2) for the incompressible ﬂuid, the ﬂuid velocity is a

solenoidal vector. Thus, within the framework of this approach, the required quantity f α(aα)

can be determined only up to an arbitrary potential vector. The potential component of the

induced surface force must make no contribution to the ﬂuid velocity. Therefore, instead of

the ﬁrst equation in system (5.38), as an additional equation, we can use the condition of

the absence of the potential component of the induced surface force density f α(aα).

In the general case where the interaction between the particles is taken into account, the

conditions of the absence of the potential components of the induced surface forces can be

written in the form

where

In the case where both the solenoidal and potential components of the induced surface

forces should be determined, a certain additional equation linearly independent of the second

and third equations of system (5.38) should be formulated.

To derive additional equations with regard for the interaction between the particles in

the ﬂuid, we consider relation (3.5) at r = Rα and equate it to relation (2.17) given at

r = Rα. As result, we get the relations

Thus, in the general case, Eqs. (5.49) diﬀer from Eqs. (5.46) corresponding to the ab-

side. However, in the approximation of noninteracting particles, equating the right-hand of

Eqs. (5.49) to zero, we obtain Eqs. (5.48), which means that the induced surface forces have

no potential components in this approximation.

Relations (5.75) and (5.77) coincide with the well-known distributions of the ﬂuid velocity

and pressure induced by a sphere moving with the constant velocity U α in the immovable

ﬂuid (vinf = 0) or with the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid uniformly moving with

the velocity vinf relative to an immovable sphere (U α = 0) [5]. Relation (5.76) describes

the known distribution of the velocity of the ﬂuid induced by a sphere rotating in it with

the constant angular velocity Ωα [5].

Using relations (5.68), (5.69), and (5.71), we obtain the following main contributions to

However, for the correct description of the ﬂuid velocity and pressure up to these powers

ﬂuid induced by particle β

In this approximation, rα can be interpreted as the distance from a certain point inside this

system (e.g., its center) to the point of observation.

Naturally, these relations can be also derived by using the superposition principle for the

Thus, the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid induced by the system of equal spheres

in the far zone, in zero approximation with respect to the ratio of the typical distance

between two spheres to the distance to the point of observation, can represented as the

velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid induced by a single sphere moving in the ﬂuid with

the translational velocity U tot + vinf and rotating with the angular velocity Ωtot. In the

particular case of two equal spheres rotating in the opposite directions with equal angular

velocities, their rotation has no eﬀect on the ﬂuid velocity far from the spheres within the

framework of the considered approximation.

According to (5.22), (5.27), (5.29), (5.20), and (5.33), in the approximation of noninter-

Relation (5.92) is the classical Stokes force acting by the ﬂuid on a sphere moving in

it with the constant velocity U α if the ﬂuid moves with constant velocity vinf . Relation

(5.93) illustrates the well-known fact of the absence of a force acting on a sphere due to

its rotation. The ﬁrst term in relation (5.94) corresponds to the known Fax´en relation [1]

deﬁned by the classical Stokes law with the velocity equal to the velocity of inhomogeneous

motion of the ﬂuid in the absence of spheres averaged over the surface of sphere α.

Substituting (5.92)–(5.94) into (2.27) and taking into account the absence of the inertial

force F in

total force acting on particle α:

According to (5.98), we have the well-known result of the absence of the torque acting on a

sphere moving with a constant velocity in an unbounded ﬂuid. Relation (5.99) is the classical

result for the torque exerted by the ﬂuid on a sphere rotating in it with constant angular

velocity Ωα [1]. The ﬁrst term in (5.100) corresponds to the torque exerted by the ﬂuid on

sphere α due to the inhomogeneous motion of the ﬂuid in the absence of particles caused by

the solenoidal component of the external force ﬁeld. For a homogeneous distribution of the

ﬂuid velocity, this torque is equal to zero. The second term in (5.100) deﬁned as follows:

Therefore, system (5.110) has an inﬁnite number of solutions that diﬀer only in the

potential component. To determine the unique solution, it is necessary to introduce an

additional equation linearly independent of the equations of this system. To derive this

equation, we use relations (5.47)–(5.50) and get

action between the particles leads to the appearance of the potential components f (p)

Thus, the interaction of particles leads to the appearance of all harmonics for the com-

ponents of the induced surface force density connected with the translational motion of

particles and their rotation.

Since the potential component f (p,1)

(aα) of the induced surface force density f (1)

α (aα)

α

has only harmonics with l = 1 deﬁned by (5.117), we obtain the following results for the

corresponding ﬂuid velocity and pressure (rα ≥

Thus, the potential component f (p,1)

β

(aβ), where β = 1, 2, . . . N, of the induced surface

force density makes no contribution to the ﬂuid velocity, while the ﬂuid pressure caused

by this potential force is equal to zero everywhere with the exception of the surface of the

sphere where this force is distributed.

In view of (5.117), the potential component f (p,1)

(aα) is represented in the form

and, hence, has only the radial constant component. In this case, it is easy to see that the

potential component of the induced surface force has no eﬀect on the forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles immersed in it.

These conclusions concerning the inﬂuence of the potential component of the induced

surface force densities on the ﬂuid velocity and pressure as well as on the forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on particles also remain valid for any nth iteration if the potential

component f (p,n)

α (aα) corresponding to this

iteration has only harmonics with l = 1 deﬁned by a relation similar to (5.117).

By virtue of relations (5.105), (5.106), (5.115), (5.116), (5.118), (5.119), (5.121), and

(5.122), in this approximation, the main contribution to the ﬂuid velocity and pressure

According to (5.128)–(5.131), the main terms of the ﬂuid velocity and pressure caused by

Substituting (5.105) and (5.106) into (5.22) and (5.116), (5.118), and (5.119) into (5.23)

Relation (5.132) agrees with the second term in relation (44) in [30] corresponding to

the ﬁrst iteration. It is worth noting that relation (5.133) for the force exerted by the ﬂuid

on a sphere due to rotation of the rest spheres coincides with the known result for two

spheres [12], while the corresponding force given by the ﬁrst term in relation (49) in [30] is

proportional to the inverse tensor ˜K

Relations (5.134) and (5.135) also agree with the known relations for the torques exerted by

the ﬂuid on a sphere due to the translational motion and rotation of the rest spheres [1,12].

According to (5.132) and (5.108), the force F (t,1)

The terms proportional to σ3 in (5.132) should be retained only if the problem is solved

Often, it is necessary to determine the velocities of particles in a ﬂuid in given external

force ﬁelds (in particular, the sedimentation velocity of particles in a ﬂuid due to the action

of the gravity force) and to investigate the inﬂuence of hydrodynamic interactions between

the particles on their motion. Let U α and Ωα be, respectively, the velocity of translational

motion and the angular velocity of a single sphere α in a ﬂuid caused by the action of a

certain external force ﬁeld. In the case of several spheres, these velocities change due to

hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres. Using relations (5.133)–(5.136), in this

approximation, we can represent the changed velocities ˜U α and ˜Ωα as follows:

well-known result in [1] for the angular velocity of sphere α, whose rotation is induced by

the motion of sphere β moving in the ﬂuid with the relative translational velocity U (t)

Analogously, we can determine the harmonics of the induced surface force density (and,

hence, the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid) for higher iterations.

In the investigation of analogous problems, the main question is connected with the

substantiation of the reduction of the inﬁnite system of equations in unknown quantities

[27,28] (for the considered approach, the unknown harmonics f α,lm). Within the framework

of this approach, we can reformulate this question as follows: How many iterations must

be carried out to obtain the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid, the forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on particles immersed in it up to σp, where p is a certain positive integer?

Using the results obtained above, we can show that for any iteration n

1, the main terms

≥

of the quantities f (t,n)

α,lm, f (ext,n)

α,lm , and f (r,n)

α,lm are proportional, respectively, to σl+n and σl+n+1,

moreover, starting from n = 2 [for f (ext,n)

α,lm , starting from n = 0], these quantities contain

inﬁnite sums of higher powers of σ. For this reason, to obtain the induced velocity and

pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid up to σp, it is necessary:

(i) to carry out p iterations,

(ii) for each sth iteration, where s

p, to retain only harmonics with l = 0, 1, . . . , p

s,

≤

−

(iii) in each retained harmonic, to retain all terms up to terms proportional to σp inclusively.

Further simpliﬁcation of the results depends on the point of observation.

Substituting (5.143) and (5.144) into (5.22) and (5.147), (5.148), and (5.150) into (5.23)

and taking relation (5.97) into account, after certain transformations, we obtain the following

relations for the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on particles due to their translational

motion and rotation corresponding to the second iteration:

The ﬁrst terms in (5.156)–(5.159) correspond to the self-interaction of particle α due to

the action of the ﬂuid induced by this particle and reﬂected from the rest particles. The

second terms in these relations, which are nonequal to zero only for N

three-particle interaction. For ﬁxed α and β, these terms describe the contribution to the

force and torque acting on particle α by the ﬂuid induced by particle β and scattered by

all rest particles (except for α). For a system of two spheres, relations (5.156)–(5.159) agree

with the well-known results given in [1,12]

Taking relations (5.132)–(5.135) and (5.156)–(5.159) into account, we can represent the

velocity of translational motion ˜U α and angular velocity ˜Ωα of particle α in a ﬂuid in given

particles immersed in the ﬂuid in these ﬁelds as follows:

Relations for the translational friction tensors ξT T

the corresponding well-known relations given in [20] retaining in them terms up to the second

order in σ inclusively.

According to (5.170)–(5.179), the friction tensors of translational (ξT T

αβ ) and rotational

(ξRR

αβ ) motions of particles are determined up to σ2 and σ4, respectively, and the tensors
αβ and ξRT

tensors deﬁned by (5.170)–(5.175) with N = 2 calculated up to the above-mentioned orders

in σ agree with the results given in [12].

In view of (5.166)–(5.169), the force and the torque exerted by the ﬂuid on particle α

due to the translational motion and rotation of all particles are deﬁned as follows:

Within the framework of the considered approximation, for which µT T

αβ , and

µT R

αβ are determined up to terms of σ2, σ4, σ3, and σ3, respectively, relations (5.185)–(5.188)

for the mobility tensors coincide with known results given in [19]. Unlike the friction tensors

calculated in this approximation, the mobility tensors are determined only by two-particle

interactions and µT R

αα = µRT

αα = 0. In order to take into account three-particle interactions

in the mobility tensors, it is necessary to carry out calculations for higher iterations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper, we have proposed the procedure for the determination of the time-

dependent velocity and pressure ﬁelds of an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid in an

external force ﬁeld induced by an arbitrary number of spheres moving and rotating in it

as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles. The corresponding

quantities are expressed in terms of the induced surface force densities. We showed that the

relations for the required harmonics of the induced surface force densities given in [30] for

the stationary case are expressed in terms on nonexistent inverse tensors. We analyzed in

detail the reasons for zero of the determinant of the corresponding system of equations. We

formulated the consistent system of algebraic equations in the harmonics of these induced

surface force densities. In the stationary case, we obtained relations for the harmonics up to

58

the second approximation inclusively. The obtained general results for the ﬂuid velocity and

pressure and the friction and mobility tensors corresponding to the second approximation

agree with the well-known results obtained by other methods in various particular cases.

The proposed procedure can be used for the investigation of hydrodynamic interactions

of particles in the ﬂuid for higher-order approximations in a similar way as it is realized in

the present paper. At the same time, the relations for the ﬂuid velocity and pressure and the

forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the particles expressed in the present paper in terms

of induced surface forces and the proposed procedure for the determination of these forces

can be regarded as a basis for the study of hydrodynamic interactions between particles

in the nonstationary case. Certain results concerning the time-dependent hydrodynamic

interactions of particles in a nonstationary ﬂuid will be given in subsequent papers.

The author express the deep gratitude to Prof. I. P. Yakimenko for drawing his attention

to this problem and for useful discussions and advices.

APPENDIX:

To determine the explicit form of the quantities Fl1l2,l(rα, rβ, Rαβ, ω), Cl1l2,l(rα, rβ, Rαβ),

and Pl1l2,l(rα, aβ, Rαβ, ω) deﬁned by relations (3.36), (3.40), and (3.42), it is necessary to

take integrals of the product of three spherical Bessel functions. For this purpose, ﬁrst, we

≥

59

known relation J−n(x) = (

1)nJn(x) valid for integer n. To take this integral, we use the

Hankel method [35]. To this end, we consider the following auxiliary integral:

functions of z in the entire complex plane of z with the cut (

the integrals along the contours CR and Cr are ﬁnite. Since R

where c = a + b, the integral along the contour CR is equal to zero for α < 3 1

α = 3 1

the following constraint on the quantity α for γ

Abstract

We outline a statistical theory of turbulence based on the Lagrangian formulation of ﬂuid motion.

We derive a hierarchy of evolution equations for Lagrangian N-point probability distributions as

well as a functional equation for a suitably deﬁned probability functional which is the analog of

Hopf’s functional equation. Furthermore, we adress the derivation of a generalized Fokker-Plank

equation for the joint velocity-position probability density of N ﬂuid particles.

The strategy of approaching the phenomenon of fully developed turbulence by considering

the statistics of Lagrangian ﬂuid particles has a long tradition dating back to the early works

of Taylor [1], Richardson [2] (for an overview, see [3], [4], [5]). Recently, interest in the

Lagrangian statistics has been renewed by rigorous results on passive scalar advection in

the Kraichnan model [6]. Additionally, experimental progress has opened the way to gain

accurate data on the motion of tracer particles which allows one to directly evaluate the

statistics of the particle acceleration [7], [8] ,[9], [10]. These experiments will also shed light

on the physics of relative dispersion of ﬂuid particles [11].

A statistical formulation of the problem of turbulence starting from the Lagrangian point

of view will lead to considerable progress in modeling turbulent ﬂows by Lagrangian pdf

method [12], [13] [15]. This method can successfully deal with passive scalar transport,

turbulent ﬂows involving chemical reactions or combustion [14]. In this approach, which

origionally dates back to Oboukhov [16], Fokker-Planck equations are used to model the

statistical behaviour of ﬂuid particles. Although this is an appealing approach, only few

eﬀorts have been made to relate the Lagrangian turbulence statistics to diﬀusion processes

by a direct investigation of the Navier-Stokes equation. An exception is the work of Heppe

[21], who uses a projector-formalism to obtain a generalized diﬀusion equation for the joint

velocity-position probability distribution of one particle.

In the following we shall present a hierarchy of evolution equations for N-point probability

distributions describing the behaviour of N particles in a turbulent ﬂow. The hierarchy is

in close analogy to the one presented by Lundgren [23] and Ulinich and Ljubimov [24] for

the probability distributions of the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld (see [4]). Additionally we derive

a functional equation for a suitably deﬁned probability functional, which is the analog of

Hopf’s functional equation [22] and, therefore, is a concise formulation of the problem of

turbulence in the Lagrangian formulation.

Then we shall adress the question whether a type of diﬀusion process in the sense of

the random force method advocated by Novikov [17] can approximate the motion of N

particles. We shall derive a generalized Fokker-Planck equation involving memory terms,

which determines the evolution of the N-point probability distribution. However, the drift

and diﬀusion terms of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation are expressed in terms of

conditional probabilities of higher order such that the problem remains unclosed.

In a

following paper we shall adress closure approximations.

I. FORMAL LAGRANGIAN DESCRIPTION

In the present section we shall introduce a formal Lagrangian description of ﬂuid ﬂow,

which will be suitable for formulating evolution equations for statistical quantities. We

consider the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible Eulerian velocity ﬁeld u(x, t):

∂
∂t

u(x, t) + u(x, t) · ∇u(x, t) = −∇p(x, t) + ν∆u(x, t)

.

(1)

In order to obtain a closed evolution equation one has to express the pressure as a functional

of the velocity ﬁeld. As is well known the pressure is governed by the Poisson equation

∆p(x, t) = −∇ · [u(x, t) · ∇u(x, t)]

.

(2)

In the case of a ﬁnite ﬂuid volume V appropriate boundary conditions have to be formulated.

Let us consider the case with a prescribed normal component of the pressure gradient. The

solution of this von Neumann boundary value problem reads

p(x, t) =

dxG(|x − x′|)∇ · [u(x′, t) · ∇u(x′, t)]

+

G(x − x′)∇p(x′, t) · dA

1
4π ZV

4π ZδV

Here, G(x − x′) denotes the Green’s function

∆G(x − x′) = −4πδ(x − x′)

n · ∇x′G(x − x′) = −

x′ ∈ δV

.

4π
S

S is the area of the surface δV enclosing the ﬂuid. The boundary condition is incorporated

into the deﬁnition of the Green’s function.

In the case of an inﬁnitely extended ﬂuid volume the boundary term vanishes and the

Green’s function is given by

G(x, x′) =

1
|x − x′|

.

Now we can state the Navier-Stokes equation:

∂
∂t

u(x, t) + u(x, t) · ∇u(x, t)

= −

In order to obtain a convenient formulation for the subsequent statistical treatment we have

introduced the following notation for the pressure and the viscous terms, respectively:

[Γ(x, x′) : u(x′, t) : u(x′, t)]α =

G(x − x′)uβ(x′, t)uγ(x′, t)

F(x, t) = −

∇xG(x − x′)n · ∇p(x′, t)] · dA

L(x, x′) = ∆xδ(x − x′)

.

(7)

The quantity L(x, x′) is a generalized function and is deﬁned in a formal sense. The term

F(x, t) is due to boundary conditions, c.f. eq. (3). Note, that we have assumed that the

normal pressure gradient is prescribed at the boundary.

Now we turn to a Lagrangian formulation of the equation of ﬂuid motion. To this end

we consider a Lagrangian path X(t, y) of a ﬂuid particle, which initially was located at

X(t0, y) = y. The velocity of the particle is given in terms of the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld

u(X(t, y), t), whereas the Navier-Stokes equation takes the form

X(t, y) = u(X(t, y), t)

For the evaluation of the integrals we perform a coordinate transformation

Due to incompressibility, the Jacobian equals unity:

Now we deﬁne the Lagrangian velocity U(t, y) according to

x′ = X(t, y′)

U(t, y) = u(X(t, y), t)

We have obtained a representation of the acceleration of a Lagrangian particle, although this

expression is formal due to the appearance of the generalized function L(x, x′). Nevertheless,

we shall ﬁnd that one recovers meaningful and well deﬁned expressions when one proceeds

to a statistical formulation.

II. EULERIAN AND LAGRANGIAN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

The purpose of the present section is to develop a statistical description of the ﬂuid

motion. The central quantities will be N-point position-velocity probability densities and,

as the most general quantity, a velocity-position probability functional.

We start by deﬁning the N-point Lagrangian velocity-position distribution function

f N ({uj, xj, yj}; t) =

< δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − U(t, y1)]....δ[xN − X(t, yN )]δ[uN − U(t, yN )] >

. (13)

This distribution function allows one to statistically characterize the behaviour of a swarm

of N ﬂuid particles. The brackets indicate averaging with respect to a suitably deﬁned

statistical ensemble. Since we have X(t = 0, y) = y the initial condition at t = 0 reads:

f N ({uj, xj, yj}; t = 0) =

δ(x1 − y1)....δ(xN − yN )gN ({uj, yj})

,

(14)

where gN ({uj, yj}) is the joint probability distribution for the N velocities of the ﬂuid
particles at initial time t = 0. In the stationary case, gN ({uj, yj}) is the Eulerian probability

distribution deﬁned below.

The N-point probability distribution for the particle locations, pN ({xj, yj}; t) is obtained

by integration with respect to the velocities uj and is the central quantity in the theory

of dispersion of particles in turbulence. Alternatively, we may integrate eq. (13) over the

spatial variables and obtain the pure velocity probability distributions of the particles.

It is convenient to additionally deﬁne the corresponding Eulerian probability distribution

f N
E (u1, x1; ..; uN , xN ; t) =< δ(u1 − u(x1, t))..δ(uN − u(xN , t)) >

.

(15)

These probability distributions are obtained from the corresponding Lagrangian (13) ones by

integration with respect to yj, since the ﬂuid ﬂow is incompressible such that the Jacobian

5

(10) equals unity. Furthermore, the Eulerian probability distributions have to fullﬁll the

following consistency conditions

∇xif N

E (u1, x1; ..; uN , xN ; t) =

Z

i = 1, .., N

.

These relationships are a consequence of the fact that the spatial dependency of the proba-

bility distribution enters via the velocity ﬁeld u(x, t).

Finally, we mention that it is also straightforward to deﬁne mixed Eulerian and La-

grangian probability distributions. They can be obtained from the Lagrangian probability

distribution by integration over the variables yi, for which an Eulerian description is per-

formed:

f N
E|L(u1, x1; ..; um, xm; um+1, xm+1, ym+1; ..; un, xn, yn; t) =

< δ(u1 − u(x1, t))..δ(um − u(xm, t))

δ[xm+1 − X(t, ym+1)]δ[um+1 − u(X(t, ym+1), t)]....

=

dy1...dymf N

L (u1, x1, y1; ..; un, xn, yn; t)

(17)

Since the Navier-Stokes equation form a classical ﬁeld theory a complete description

of the Lagrangian turbulence statistics is contained in the probability density functional

P [x(y), u(y), t] deﬁned by an average over functional delta distributions:

P [x(y), u(y), t] =< D[x(y) − X(t, y)]D[u(y) − U(t, y)] >

.

(18)

A probability functional for the ﬁeld X(t, y′) is obtained by functional integration with

respect to the velocity:

G[x(y), t] =

Du(y)P [x(y), u(y), t]

.

The functional Fouriertransform of the quantity (18) is the characteristic functional

Z[η(y), k(y), t] =< ei

dy[η(y)·U(t,y)+k(y)·X(y,t)] >

.

This is the Lagrangian analog of the functional introduced by Hopf [22].

III. HIERARCHY OF EVOLUTION EQUATIONS FOR THE N-POINT PROBA-

BILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS

In the present section we shall obtain an inﬁnite chain of evolution equations for the

Lagrangian probability distribution functions f N ({uj, xj, yj}; t), N = 1, 2, .... For the sake

of simplicity we consider a ﬂuid in an inﬁnitely extended space. Therefore, we do not have

to take into account boundary terms. The extention to the case of a ﬂuid in a bounded area

is straightforward.

We start by considering the one-point pdf f 1(u, x, y; t), for which we try to obtain an

evolution equation by calculating the temporal derivative:

∂
∂t

f 1(u1, x1, y1; t) =
∂
∂t
= −∇x1· < ˙X(t, y1)δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >

< δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >

−∇u1· < ˙u(X(t, y1), t)δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >

.

(21)

For the ﬁrst term we can use the relationship

< ˙X(t, y1)δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >=

< u(X(t, y1), t)δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >=

u1 < δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >

.

(22)

In order to evaluate the second term we have to insert the Lagrangian formulation of the

Navier-Stokes equation (12):

< ˙u(X(t, y1), t)δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >=

dy′ < Γ[X(t, y), X(t, y′)] : u(X(t, y′), t) : u(X(t, y′), t)

δ[x1 − X(t, y1)]δ[u1 − u(X(t, y1), t)] >

.

(23)

The aim is to relate this term in some way to a Lagrangian probability distribution. This

can be achieved by inserting the identity

dx2δ[x2 − X(t, y′)]δ[u2 − u(X(t, y′), t)]

.

(25)

We now combine the above formulas to obtain the evolution equation for the Lagrangian

probability distribution f 1({u1, x1, y1}; t):

∂

.

Due to the nonlocality of the pressure and the viscous term, which relates the Lagrangian

path of a particle under consideration to the paths of diﬀerent particles, the evolution

equation of the one-particle pdf is linked to the two-particle pdf.

It is straightforward to prove that the N-point distribution function fullﬁlls the evolution

equation:

As in the case of the one-point pdf no closed equation for the N-point pdf is obtained. The

evolution equation for the N-point pdf contains the N+1-point pdf leading to a hierarchy of

In the dissipation term we can perform a partial integration which eliminates the formally

deﬁned operator L(xi, x). Additionally, one can recast the pressure and dissipation terms

in a way which evidences Galilean invariance:

.

Here, σ denotes the triple u, x, y. A is an operator which is related to the acceleration and

is deﬁned according to:

A(xi − x, ui − u) = −Γ(xi, x) : (u − ui) : (u − ui) + νδ(xi − x)∆x[u − ui]

.

(30)

One may also add a random force ﬁeld, which is Gaussian as well as δ-correlated in time.

Then a diﬀusion term of the form

1
2 Xi Xj

∇uiQ(xi, xj)∇uj f N ({σj}; t)

(31)

has to be included.

It is important to formulate the following invariance properties of the hierarchy. Due

to Galilean invariance f N ({ui + c, xi − ct, yi}; t) solves the hierarchy provided that
f N ({ui, xi, yi}; t) is a solution of the hierarchy. Neglecting the viscous terms, it can be shown
that if f N ({ui, xi, yi}; t) is a solution, then also λ3(γ+δ)f N ({λγui, λδxi, λδyi}; λt) solves the

hierachy for each value of λ, provided that

δ − γ = 1

.

(32)

The scale symmetry for an arbitrary value of δ is obviously broken by the viscous term.

As we have indicated above, the Eulerian N-point pdf can be calculated by the cor-

responding Lagrangian pdf by integration with respect to the initial locations yi of the

particles. Integrating each equation of the hierarchy (29) we obtain a corresponding one for

the Eulerian probability distribution function. This hierarchy has already been presented

by Lundgren [23] as well as Ulinich and Lyubimov [24].

Let us brieﬂy comment on the question why a whole hierarchy of evolution equation arises.

The mathematical treatment of ﬂuid ﬂow leads to a ﬁeld theory. Considering only a ﬁnite

9

number of ﬂuid particles, therefore, yields a description with restricted information. This

reduction of information shows up in the existence of an unclosed hierarchy of evolution

equations for the joint velocity-position pdfs. A closed evolution equation can only be

expected to arise when one approaches the continuum description, i.e. when one considers

the full probability density functional deﬁned in eq. (18).

IV. EVOLUTION EQUATION FOR THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNC-

TIONAL

density functional P [x(y), u(y), t]. Time diﬀerentiation yields:

.

(33)

Using the Lagrangian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation (12) we end up with the

following relation:

We have arrived at a closed equation determining the evolution of the probability functional

P [x(y), u(y), t]. The N-point probability functions f N ({ui, xi, yi}; t) can be obtained from

P [x(y), u(y), t] by functional integration

f N ({ui, xi, yi}; t) = Z

.

(35)

The hierarchy of evolution equations (29) for the N-point pdfs is a projection of the functional

equation (34) onto the pdf of N ﬂuid particles according to (35). We mention that, in

principle, a projector formalism should be used to pass from the evolution equation for

10

the probability functional (34) to a closed equation for the projected N-point probability

distribution.

V. GENERALIZED FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATIONS

If we investigate the problem of turbulence by a hierarchy of evolution equations such

as (29) we need to formulate suitable closure schemes.

In the following we shall present

a formulation of (29) which seems to be more suitable for that purpose. It is inﬂuenced

by the so-called Lagrangian pdf method [12], [13] , [15] , whose basic idea is to model the

acceleration term by a stochastic force. Assuming Markovian properties the model pdf obeys

a Fokker-Planck equation of the form

The question arises, what functional form of the drift term D1({uj, xj, yj}) and the diﬀusion

matrix D2({uj, xj, yj}) has to be chosen in order to obtain an accurate model of turbulent

ﬂows. Although the case of a single ﬂuid particle seems to be well-investigated [13], the case

of several ﬂuid particles has to be studied in more detail [17], [18], [15]. Interesting models

for several ﬂuid particles have been devised by Pumir et al. [19], [20].

Origionally, the random force method dates back to Oboukhov [16], who suggested to

use a Fokker-Planck equation without drift term and a constant diﬀusion term for the single

particle case.

(N+1)-point pdf):

In the following we shall derive a generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation directly

from the hierarchy (29). To this end we consider equation (29) to be a linear inhomogeneous

equation, which can be solved in a straightforward manner (we consider the case of the

The ﬁrst term stems from the initial condition.

We remind the reader that we have considered the force free case. Nonrandom forces

(Here, T denotes Dysons time ordering operator). Whereas the ﬁrst evolution operator

the second evolution operator replaces

where X(x, t − t0) is the solution of the set of diﬀerential equations

U(x, 0) = u

.

Let us make some remarks on the external force. In three dimensional turbulence the

force varies on the so-called integral scale, which is larger than the scales belonging to the

inertial scale. That implies that during inertial time scales the relative motion of Lagrangian

particles located within the inertial range is not inﬂuenced by the external force, i.e. by the

mechanism how the turbulence is generated. Therefore, on time scales belonging to the

inertial time scale the approximation (39) is suﬃciently good for our purposes.

Now we insert the obtained expression into the acceleration term of eq. (29). As a result

we arrive at the hierarchy

The last term stems from the initial condition. We want to point out that, in some sense,

the present procedure is analogous to a projection operator formalism [26]. It is well-known

that the stochastic equations contain initial terms after projection. By some more or less

sophisticated arguments, these initial terms are dropped.

Our result (43) takes the form of a generalized Fokker-Planck equation, where the gen-

eralized drift term is given by

D1(xi|{ui, ˜xi, yi}; t, t′)) =

A formally closed equation has been obtained by the introduction of the conditional proba-

bility distribution

f N +2(σ′; σ; {σj}; t) = pN +2(σ′; σ|{σj}; t)f N ({σj}; t)

(45)

(σ denotes the triple u, x, y.) A successful description of Lagrangian turbulence statistics

can be achieved if this conditional probability distribution can either be approximated or

modeled in a suitable way. Thereby, the fundamental symmetries, i.e. Galilean and scale

invariance (for ν = 0), have to be retained. Furthermore, incompressibility of the ﬂuid

motion should be conserved. This requirement seems to be the major diﬃculty, since any

13

approximation has a consequence for the pressure term. However, only a correct treatment

of the pressure term guarantees incompressibility of the ﬂuid.

VI. SUMMARY

We have formulated a hierachy of evolution equations for the Lagrangian N-point pdf’s

in close analogy to the one for the Eulerian pdf’s presented by Lundgren [23] and Ulinich

and Lyubimov [24]. Due to the pressure and dissipative terms the N-point probability

distributions couple to (N+1)-point distributions. The existence of a whole hierarchy of

evolution equations is due to the fact that a ﬁeld theory is described by a ﬁnite number of

points. A closed statistical equation arises when one deﬁnes a probability functional. We

have formulated an evolution equation for this functional which is the Lagrangian analog of

Hopf’s functional equation.

Furthermore, we have tried to derive the Lagrangian pdf models [12], which are successful

in modeling various aspects of turbulent ﬂows by diﬀusion processes. Starting from the

hierarchy of evolution equations for N-point pdfs we arrived at a generalized Fokker-Planck

equation, i.e. a diﬀusion equation containing memory terms as well as a term steming from

the initial condition. The generalized drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are formally expressed

by conditional probability distributions, so that the problem is not closed. In a following

paper we shall adress the problem of formulating suitable closure approximations [25].

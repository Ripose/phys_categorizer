The random forced Navier-Stokes equation can be obtained as a variational problem of a proper
action. In virtue of incompressibility, the integration over transverse components of the ﬁelds allows
to cast the action in the form of a large deviation functional. Since the hydrodynamic operator is
nonlinear, the functional integral yielding the statistics of ﬂuctuations can be practically computed
by linearizing around a physical solution of the hydrodynamic equation. We show that this procedure
yields the dimensional scaling predicted by K41 theory at the lowest perturbative order, where the
perturbation parameter is the inverse Reynolds number. This result is valid over a ﬁnite spatio-
temporal domain, where the physical solution can be considered as stationary.

I. INTRODUCTION

A ﬁeld theoretic approach to the study of the random stirred Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) can be traced back to the
seminal paper by Martin, Siggia and Rose [1]. This was the starting point for the application of many perturbative
strategies, e.g. diagramatic expansions and renormalization group methods [2]. The many technical diﬃculties
encountered in developing such approaches avoided to gather conclusive achievements. For recent developments
and applications the reader can be addressed to [3]. In this paper we show that one step forward along this ﬁeld-
theoretic approach allows one to cast the action associated with the NSE into the form of a large deviation functional.
Recently, large-deviation theory has scored sensible success in describing ﬂuctuations in stationary non-equilibrium
regimes of various microscopic models [4]. This approach is mainly based on the extension of the time-reversal
conjugacy property introduced by Onsager and Machlup [5] to stationary non-equilibrium states. In practice, thermal
ﬂuctuations in irreversible stationary processes can be traced back to a proper hydrodynamic description derived from
the microscopic evolution rules. The action functional has the quadratic form

where ρ(t, ~x) represents in general a vector of thermodynamic variables depending on time t and space variables ~x.
The symbol
denotes the integration over space variables. W is a hydrodynamic evolution operator acting on
ρ: it vanishes when ρ is equal to the stationary solution ¯ρ, which is assumed to be unique. The positive kernel K(ρ)
represents the stochasticity of the system at macroscopic level. According to the large deviation-theory the entropy
S of a stationary non-equilibrium state is related to the action functional I as follows:

·i

h·

S(ρ) = inf
ˆρ

I[

,0](ˆρ)

where the minimum is taken over all trajectories connecting ¯ρ to ρ.

For our purposes it is enough to consider that the action functional I provides a natural measure for statistical
ﬂuctuations in non-equilibrium stationary states, so that, formally, any statistical inference can be obtained from I.
Indeed, from the very beginning we have to deal with a hydrodynamic formulation, namely the random stirred NSE:
in the next Section we will argue that an action functional of the form (1) can be obtained by ﬁeld-theoretic analytic
calculations.

In particular, explicit integration over all longitudinal components of the velocity ﬁeld and over the associated
auxiliary ﬁelds can be performed. This allows to obtain a hydrodynamic evolution operator W which depends only
on the transverse components of the velocity ﬁeld vT (t, ~x). Moreover, the positive kernel K amounts to the inverse
correlation function of the stochastic source, while any dependence on the form of the pressure tensor and of the noise
does not enter in the determination of W . Accordingly, many of the technical diﬃculties characterizing standard
perturbative methods and diagramatic expansions have been removed.

1

On the other hand, we have to face with new diﬃculties. The hydrodynamic operator appearing in the large
deviation functional is nonlinear, so that functional integration is unfeasible. One should identify a stationary solution
¯vT (t, ~x) of the associated hydrodynamic equation and linearize the hydrodynamic operator around such a solution.
Then, functional integration could be performed explicitly on the “ﬂuctuation” ﬁeld.
In order to be well deﬁned
this approximate procedure would demand the uniqueness of the stationary solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamic
equation. Conversely, it can be easily veriﬁed that it admits several solutions. This notwithstanding, we have found
only one solution that does not yield unphysical divergences in the long time and large space limits (see Section III).
Accordingly, we have assumed that ﬂuctuations can be meaningfully estimated only with respect to this solution.
Speciﬁcally, our statistical non-equilibrium measure is constructed by considering “trajectories” of the transverse
component of the velocity ﬁeld vT (t, ~x) that are connected to ¯vT (t, ~x) by the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld uT (t, ~x). Let us point
out that, consistently with the linearization procedure, the statistical measure is assumed to be concentrated around
¯vT (t, ~x). One further technical problem is that the linearized hydrodynamic operator has coeﬃcients depending on
both space and time variables through ¯vT (t, ~x), as a consequence of its originary nonlinear nature. It depends also on
in such a way that the action integral can be naturally solved by a perturbative expansion in
the Reynolds number
also yield a weak dependence on time of ¯vT (t, ~x). These

. In particular, we guess that it holds also for moderately large

Since our main purpose here is the estimation of the structure function (see Section V) as an average over the non-
equilibrium measure induced by the action I, we have to assume that the perturbative expansion applies in a wide
range of values of
, since a statistical average of
R
, i.e. in a regime of fully developed turbulence. We will argue
any observable cannot be valid for too large values of
that statistical estimations can be consistently obtained for values of
which extend up to the region of stability of
the solution ¯vT (t, ~x). Beyond this region we have no practical way of controlling the convergence of the linearization
procedure. It is worth stressing that we obtain an analytic expression of the structure function: the so–called K41
scaling law [6] is recovered on a spatial scale, whose nontrivial dependence on

is explicitly indicated.

In order to investigate the statistics of ﬂuctuations, the determination of the hydrodynamic trajectory minimizing
the entropy functional has to be performed explicitly. Unfortunately, existence and uniqueness theorems for the
solution of eq. (15) are not available and the criterion for chosing a suitable solution can rely only upon physical
considerations. Actually, we have found several diﬀerent solutions: among them, the only one unaﬀected by divergences

Due to the invariance under Galileo transformations, solution (17) is determined up to two vector parameters; the

For suﬃciently small initial perturbations, linear analysis can be applied up to a time scale where the nonlinear terms
are kept small with respect to the linear ones. An upper bound for this time scale is computed in Appendix A:

This upper bound turns out to be consistently smaller than τD. Moreover, a suﬃcient condition for the stability of

We recall that we aim at obtaining explicit expresions for the structure functions of the perturbation ﬁeld around the
quasi-steady solution by performing derivatives of the functional generator with respect to the currents J α.
Without any further approximation, such a program seems to be prohibitive. Some simpliﬁcations have to be intro-
duced, yielding a structure of the functional integral which involves Gaussian integrations.
As a ﬁrst step in this direction we replace the original action in the functional (23) by the bilinear action

(t, ~x). Note that the extreme
solution V α, around which ﬂuctuations are computed, appears explicitly in the functional IV (u). We have already
observed that the solution V α is not unique. Nevertheless, if the stability conditions of this solution with respect to
small perturbations are fulﬁlled we can conclude that it cannot be inﬂuenced by other possible solutions.

around the basic solution Vα. Here we will perform analytic calculations for the particular class of ﬂuctuations captured
by the lowest, nontrivial, integer moment of velocity diﬀerences between points separated by a distance r. For the
velocity ﬁeld, uα, this is the second-order structure function deﬁned as

At leading order in the distance r it is dominated by a dissipative contribution.

We conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the parameter region deﬁned by the conditon

where the statistically relevant wavenumbers can be unstable. As shown in Appendix C, in this case I2(r) gives
two contributions: one is again dissipative, while there is another one yielding the nontrivial scaling behavior r2/3.

It is a remarkable fact that S2 can exhibit the scaling behavior predicted by K41 theory, which is assumed to hold
when the velocity ﬂuctuations are turbulent in the so-called inertial range of scales. This suggests that hydrodynamic
ﬂuctuations in a system at the very initial stage of instability development already contain some properties attributed
to the developed turbulence regime.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have exploited ﬁeld-theoretic calculations to reformulate the random forced Navier–Stokes problem
in terms of a quadratic action functional. At a formal level, the latter has the same structure of the action describing
thermal ﬂuctuations in irreversible stationary processes. The crucial step for obtaining the hydrodynamic evolution
operator which appears in the action functional, is the integration over all longitudinal components of both velocity
and associated auxiliary ﬁelds. With respect to the standard formulation which is the starting point for diagramatic
strategies, we thus perform one more ﬁeld integration. The positive deﬁnite kernel in the action functional appears
in the form of the inverse of the forcing correlation function.
In terms of the action functional, the knowledge of the whole velocity statistics reduces to the computation of
functional integrals. However, ﬁnding an explicit solution for these integrals is quite a diﬃcult task, due to the
nonlinear character of the problem. This forces us to introduce some approximations. The starting point is the
identiﬁcation of a stationary solution around which we linearize the evolution operator. We deﬁne also a ﬂuctuation
ﬁeld (with respect to the stationary solution) and we are able to compute (perturbatively, in the inverse of the
Reynolds number) the functional integrals over such ﬂuctuation ﬁeld.

In principle, the strategy might be applied to evaluate any velocity multipoint statistical quantity.

In order to
reduce the complexity of the algebraic manipulations we limited ourselves to the calculation of the two–point second
order momentum of velocity. Indeed, we aim at understanding if ﬂuctuations at the early stage of their development
(accordingly, we dub them as pre-turbulent ﬂuctuations) already contain some important features of developed tur-
bulence. We are interested, in particular, to scale invariance. In this respect, we ﬁnd that ﬂuctuations are organized
at diﬀerent scales in a self–similar way. Remarkably, the scaling exponent coincides with the dimensional prediction
of the Kolmogorov 1941 theory [6] valid for developed turbulence regimes. Whether or not such exponent is a genuine
reminescence of the developed turbulence phenomenology needs further investigations.
Unfortunately, the complexity of the derivation leading to the K41 scaling law does not allow to identify precisely
the very origin of such a dimensional prediction. We can however argue a relationship between the observed dimen-
sional scaling and the conservation laws (for momentum and energy) associated to the two eigenvalues of the matrix
appearing in the action functional (25).
Another point to be emphasized is that the pressure term does not play any role in the derivation of the dimensional
scaling law. This is just a consequence of the fact that all the longitudinal degrees of freedom can be averaged out
from the very beginning of the computation.
We want to conclude by outlining some open problems and perspectives. A ﬁrst question concerns the relevance
to be attributed to the solution around which we linerize the evolution operator. On one side we do not see any
rigorous mathematical motivation for invoking the need of a unique solution. Just heuristic arguments based on
physical considerations allowed us to identify the selected solution. Indeed, it represents a shear-like solution, which
is a well-known generator of instability towards smaller and smaller scales.
Another interesting point concerns the computation of the third-order moment of the velocity correlators. In this case
the predictions of our approach could be compared with the 4/5-law, which is one among the very few exact results
of turbulence theories.
Finally, the extension of our results to other classes of transport problems, including passive scalar advection, could
provide a better understanding of the basic mechanism at the origin of the observed scaling behaviors.

Abstract

R´esum´e

The universality of intermittency in hydrodynamic turbulence is considered based on a recent model for the
velocity gradient tensor evolution. Three possible versions of the model are investigated diﬀering in the assumed
correlation time-scale and forcing strength. Numerical tests show that the same (universal) anomalous relative
scaling exponents are obtained for the three model variants. It is also found that transverse velocity gradients are
more intermittent than longitudinal ones, whereas dissipation and enstrophy scale with the same exponents. The
results are consistent with the universality of intermittency and relative scaling exponents, and suggest that these
are dictated by the self-stretching terms that are the same in each variant of the model.

1. Introduction

Progress in understanding the small-scale structure of three-dimensional turbulent ﬂow requires the
study of the velocity gradient tensor Aij = ∂ui/∂xj, where u denotes the velocity vector. In incompressible
ﬂow, A is trace-free, i.e. Aii = 0. The dynamical evolution of A is obtained by taking the gradient of the
Navier-Stokes equation:

where d/dt stands for the Lagrangian material derivative, p is the pressure divided by the density of the
ﬂuid and ν is the kinematic viscosity. Neglecting viscous eﬀects and the anisotropic part of the pressure
Hessian entering in Eq. (1) leads to a closed formulation of the dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor
known as the Restricted-Euler (RE) equations [1,2]. RE equations predict several phenomena observed
in various experimental [3,4] and numerical [5] studies of turbulence, such as preferential alignments of
vorticity and preferential axisymmetric extension. Recently, a system of diﬀerential equations describing
longitudinal and transverse velocity increments has been derived from this approximation and predicts
non-Gaussian statistics (and in particular skewness) of the components of A [6]. However, in this system
as well as in the RE equations, the neglect of pressure Hessian and viscous eﬀects leads to singularities
and precludes the establishment of stationary statistics due to undamped eﬀects of the self-streching
term. To adress this deﬁciency of RE dynamics, and based on prior works [7,8,9], a new model has been
proposed recently [10]. It provides closures for both pressure Hessian and viscous term entering in Eq.
(1). These closures are based on the dynamics and the geometry of the deformation experienced by the
ﬂuid during its most recent evolution. A de-correlation time scale τ entering the various closure terms
has to be speciﬁed, as well as a Gaussian forcing term. It was shown [10] that the system with τ chosen
equal to the Kolmogorov scale and a ﬁxed Gaussian forcing amplitude, reproduces stationary statistics
with a number of geometric features of the velocity gradient, as well as relative scaling exponents of
high-order moments, in strikingly close agreement to experimental and numerical measurements for real
Navier-Stokes turbulence.

In order to explore the possible universality properties of the model, in this Letter we study two diﬀerent
choices for the time-scale and also explore the consequences of varying the amplitude of the forcing term.
We pose the question of whether the anomalous scaling exponents vary from case to case, and also extend
the analysis to include scaling properties of the dissipation.

R3

The model proposed by Ref. [10] begins with a change of variables, expressing the pressure in terms
of the Lagrangian coordinates X. One may deﬁne a mapping
Mt0,t between Eulerian and Lagrangian
R3, where x(X, t) denotes the position at a time t of a ﬂuid

coordinates:
particle which was at the position x(X, t0) = X at the initial time t0. The Jacobian matrix of the inverse
mapping obeys d/dt(∂Xp/∂xi) =
Aki(∂Xp/∂xk). As argued before [10], for a relative short period of
t0 = τ , where τ is a characteristic Lagrangian decorrelation time scale for the
time (typically when t

gradient itself, namely (∂Xp/∂xi) = (exp[

In the ﬁrst approximation, spatial gradients of (∂Xp/∂xi) have been neglected [10]. In the second ap-
proximation, the short-time solution for (∂Xp/∂xi) mentioned before, the isotropy assumption for the
Lagrangian pressure Hessian (∂2p/∂Xp∂Xq ∼
δpq), and the trace-free condition of Aij have been used.
Moreover, Cτ is the short-time Cauchy-Green tensor [10]: Cτ = eτ Aeτ AT

viewed as a local version of the “tetrad model” [8]. The time-scale τ is a model parameter and can be
viewed as a characteristic time scale of the small dissipative scales of turbulence. Recent material defor-
mation history can also be used to model other Hessian tensors entering in the Navier-Stokes equation
(Eq. (1)) such as the viscous part. The resulting Hessian of A is modeled as a friction term and the
characteristic time scale entering in the description is given by the integral time scale T [10]:

A stochastic forcing term dW has been added to model the combined action of large-scale forcing and
neighboring eddies. The time evolution of A (Eq. (4)) is thus given by eight independent coupled ordinary
(or stochastic depending on the forcing dW) diﬀerential equations.

In order to understand the roles played by the pressure Hessian (Eq. (2)) and the viscous term (Eq.
(3)) in Eq. (4), some analysis can be carried out. Doing so for arbitrary initial conditions A(t0) is diﬃcult
analytically because of the high dimension of the phase space. However, following Ref. [8] one may
consider the decaying case (with dW = 0) along a particular direction corresponding to strain with two
equal positive, and one negative, eigenvalues. Along this direction on the ’Vieillefosse tail’, the tensor A
and the evolution of the relevant eigenvalue λ(t) from the model (Eq. (4)) are given by

The solution of the ODE in Eq. (5) is such that λ(t) retains the same sign as λ(0). Let us also recall that

and the ﬁnite time divergence is given by the solution λ(t) = λ(t0)/(1
tλ(t0)) in a ﬁnite time 1/λ(t0).
In our case, we see from Eq. (5) that the anisotropic part of the pressure Hessian acts directly against the
development of the singularity induced by the self-streching term. Indeed, the coeﬃcient in front of λ2 is
1; 1]. Thus this model for pressure Hessian can regularize the ﬁnite time divergence

2. Reynolds number eﬀects, intermittency, and relative anomalous scaling

In this section, three choices to model Reynolds number changes are considered: (I) constant Kol-
mogorov time scale (this was the case studied in [10] and for clarity the relevant results will be repeated
here), (II) local time scale, and (III) variable forcing strength.

Intermittency is studied by examining the scaling of moments of velocity gradients. As in [10] we
consider both longitudinal (Aii, no index summation) and transverse (Aij , i
= j) gradients. Nelkin [11]
shows that the relative scaling of higher order moments of velocity derivatives should behave as a power

Case I - Constant Kolmogorov time scale: First we consider the simplest case in which τ is a constant
value. Because τ should scale with the Lagrangian decorrelation time-scale of the velocity gradients, it is
chosen to be of the order of the Kolmogorov time scale τK [10]. This choice gives an explicit Reynolds

term with a coeﬃcient which grows exponentially with increasing λ’s. We have checked numerically that

which cannot be written as in Eq. (5), all components of A evolving under Eq. (4) tend to zero in the
absence of forcing. Without loss of generality, henceforth all variables will be scaled with the time-scale
Aij. Let us denote by Γ = τ /T the only free parameter. The forcing term
T , i.e. t/T
dW = G√2dt is Gaussian and its covariance matrix is assumed to be Reynolds number independent
(see Ref. [10] for details). The model (Eq. (4)) is solved numerically according to Ref. [10] and stationary
statistics are obtained. The results are examined from the point of view of intermittency and anomalous
relative scaling properties.

To facilitate comparison with the cases considered in II and III, in Fig. 1(a-b) we present one of the
results of Ref. [10]. These results are obtained from numerical integration of the model system over long
periods of time and the evaluation of moments of various orders. Clearly, intermittency is predicted
because the K41 line (i.e. of slope p/2, dashed lines)) does not ﬁt the computed results from the model.
We display (solid lines) various predictions obtained with the help of Eq. (6). The results can be described
well with the parameters cL
2 = 0.040 for the longitudinal and transverse cases, respectively.
Transverse gradients appear to be more intermittent than longitudinal ones. Also, as shown in Ref. [10]
2 and cT
longitudinal gradients PDF is skewed. As was stressed in Ref. [10], the intermittency parameters cL

are very close to those obtained from experimental data, see Ref. [13]. As remarked in Ref. [10], however,
for values of τ /T smaller than about 0.05 (i.e. above some Reynolds number) the predicted statistics
become unrealistic. Still, the fact that a model with only 8 degrees of freedom derived directly from the
Navier-Stokes equations predicts realistic relative intermittency exponents (albeit in a limited range of
Reynolds numbers) is quite remarkable. The results raise the question of how robust these ﬁndings are
with respect to other possible choices of the time-scale and forcing strengths. This is considered in the
next two subsections.

A, the predicted pressure Hessian is closer to isotropy. Then the system (4) is dominated more by the
quadratic (singularity-inducing) self-stretching term, which is what one may expect at higher Reynolds
numbers. In this case, for a ﬂuctuating dissipative time scale, the ODE appearing in equation Eq. (4) can

to regularize the divergence predicted by the self streching term. Therefore, similarly to the constant
Kolmogorov time-scale option considered in I, this approach appears not to allow reaching arbitrarily
high Reynolds numbers. The system using diﬀerent values of Γ is integrated numerically as in I, with the
same Gaussian forcing dW = G√2dt. Resulting moments of velocity gradients are displayed in Fig. 1(c-
d). As in I, anomalous relative scaling and intermittency is obtained. The solid lines again are obained by
using a longitudinal intermittency coeﬃcients cL

Case III: Variable forcing strength: Another option to model Reynolds number eﬀects is to vary the

increase with increasing Reynolds number based on the notion that the relative strength of forcing (com-
pared to viscous term) from neighbouring and large eddies increases with Reynolds number. The explicit

dependence on Reynolds number is unknown but since we use relative scaling, the precise relationship
with Reynolds number is not needed for the analysis. As a time-scale, in this case we use the local time
2Tr(S2), i.e. the former time scale of Eq. (7) with Γ = 1 (which is large enough

scale, namely τ (t) = 1/
q
to insure regularization along the Vieillefosse tail).

Numerical results for the moments of gradients and quantiﬁcation of relative scaling are presented
in Fig. 1(e-f) for various strengths σ of the forcing. Once again, using the representation of Eq. 6, the
results agree very well with intermittent exponents consistent with cL
2 = 0.040. Thus the
quantitative predictions of anomalous relative scaling in the model appear to be quite robust with regard
to details of the regularization time-scale and forcing.

3. Relative scaling properties of dissipation and enstrophy

The model (Eq. (4)) can also be used to predict the dynamics and statistics of several norms of the
velocity gradient tensor, namely Eǫ = 2Tr(S2) (the dissipation divided by viscosity), Eζ = 2Tr(ΩΩT ) (the
enstrophy, where Ω is the antisymetric part of A) and Eϕ = Tr(AAT ) (the “pseudo-dissipation” divided
by viscosity). It is well known that in turbulent ﬂows, these “dissipation ﬁelds” are highly intermittent
[12,15,16]. In homogeneous and isotropic turbulence,
, while higher order moments of
these quantities are not similarly linked. We will perform then, in a similar fashion as Fig. 1, a relative
scaling study of these quantities.

results don’t follow K41 predictions (dashed line). It is found that for the all three cases the relative scaling
properties are the same, i.e. again we observe robustness with respect to how Reynolds number eﬀects
are modeled. Finally, we observe that dissipation and enstrophy scale the same. The solid line shows the
multifractal predictions [17,18,19,20], using a unique intermittency parameter µ = 0.25. Similar results
are obtained when studying the relative scaling properties of the pseudo-dissipation Eϕ, i.e. we obtain
0.25 (data not shown). Thus, in the model the dissipation, enstrophy and “pseudo-dissipation”
µ
display the same or very similar intermittency exponents. The value of µ
0.25 is in excellent agreement
with previous numerical and experimental investigations [12,16].

4. Summary and Conclusions

We have examined the Lagrangian evolution of small-scale 3-D turbulence through the dynamical
equation of the velocity gradient tensor. The equation requires modeling of pressure Hessian and viscous
term to regularize the ﬁnite time divergence caused by the nonlinear self-stretching term. Several options
to represent Reynolds number in the model [10] have been considered, either varying the time-scale or
strength of forcing. Some analytical results were derived in the unforced case along the Vieillefosse tail.
Numerical integrations of the set of 8 independent ODEs show that three diﬀerent ways to represent
Reynolds number variations have led to the same (universal) intermittency relative scaling exponents.
Speciﬁcally, it has been found that longitudinal intermittency exponent is of order cL
2 = 0.025 and the
transverse one is cT
2 = 0.040, these values being strikingly close to those obtained from experimental
data [13,21]. A similar relative scaling analysis has been performed for dissipation, enstrophy and pseudo-
dissipation predicted by the model. In this case it has been found that all three quantities share the
same intermittency coeﬃcient (µ
0.25). This coeﬃcient is also rather close to the one that could be
obtained via a reﬁned similarity hypothesis (RSH) based on longitudinal velocity increments, namely
µRSH = 9cL

≈

2 = 0.225.

At this stage it may be of interest to recall some prior discussions dealing with the various scaling
exponents in turbulence. On the one hand, and in agreement with our model results, numerically and
experimentally the longitudinal and transverse velocity gradient intermittencies were found to be diﬀerent
(see for instance Ref. [22] for a recent review on the subject). Conversely (and unlike our model’s results),
they have been predicted to be the same from a ﬁeld theoretic approach (see Ref. [23] and references
therein). On the other hand, unlike our model results, enstrophy was found to be more intermittent
than dissipation in numerical ﬂows [24] (and in experiments, albeit using only a single component of
vorticity [15]), whereas (in agreement with our model) they are predicted to scale the same at inﬁnite
Reynolds numbers from simple arguments based on the ﬁniteness of inertial range width of pressure [25],
or from more systematic irreducible group representations [23]. It is therefore interesting to note that
the present model provides, for a limited range of Reynolds numbers, an example of dynamics of the
velocity gradient tensor in which transverse velocity gradients are more intermittent than longitudinal
ones, whereas dissipation and enstrophy scale the same. Clearly more research is needed to elucidate
the relationships between various exponents characterizing intermittency in turbulence, and possibly to
clarify generalizations of the reﬁned similarity hypothesis (e.g. such as in [24]). The present approach of
using Lagrangian dynamical evolution equations [10] should help shed new light on this long-standing,
important problem.

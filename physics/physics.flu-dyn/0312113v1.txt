Within the framework of random multiplicative energy cascade models of fully developed turbu-
lence, expressions for two-point correlators and cumulants are derived, taking into account a proper
conversion from an ultrametric to an Euclidean two-point distance. The comparison with two-point
statistics of the surrogate energy dissipation, extracted from various wind tunnel and atmospheric
boundary layer records, allows an accurate deduction of multiscaling exponents and cumulants.
These exponents serve as the input for parametric estimates of the probabilistic cascade generator.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The inertial-range dynamics of fully developed turbulent ﬂows reveals an ubiquitous multiscale character, driven
by large-scale forcing on one end and controlled by ﬂuid viscosity and small-scale dissipation on the other. For the
intermediate scale range, the underlying Navier-Stokes equations do not disclose any other distinguishing length scales,
thus suggesting a picture of a scale-invariant inertial-range dynamics [1, 2, 3]. This scale-invariance should reﬂect itself
in the scaling of structure functions, which are moments of velocity increments constructed from the measured velocity
data. However, measured structure functions in shear ﬂows seem to show only an approximate multiscaling character,
even at the largest accessible Reynolds numbers, where the large-scale and the dissipation scale are separated by
ﬁve orders of magnitude [4, 5, 6]. The reason for this distortion of scaling seems to be the sensitivity of structure
functions to the mean shear that is inevitably present in most natural ﬂows at high Reynolds numbers. While schemes
have been proposed to account for these eﬀects [6, 7], it has been demonstrated recently [8] that the lowest-order
two-point correlation function of the surrogate energy dissipation of a high-Reynolds-number atmospheric boundary
layer reveals a far more convincing power-law scaling over the entire inertial range, without having to resort to shear
corrections of the sort needed for structure functions. This ﬁnding suggests that the phenomenological picture of
the self-similar turbulent energy cascade may contain more truth than previously anticipated. Consequently, it is
reasonable to reexamine simple empirical energy cascade models and extend to a higher level the comparison between
the models and experimental data. This is the purpose of the paper.

Random multiplicative cascade processes (RMCP) present a particularly simple geometrical picture of the energy
cascade [2] and are a natural archetype for multiscaling.
In their binary version, for example [9], they introduce
a hierarchy of length scales lj = L/2j and a random multiplicative cascade generator is used to transport the
energy ﬂux from the integral scale L through the inertial range scales L
η down to the dissipation scale
η = L/2J. Referring to the ultrametric branching structure of binary RMCPs, N -point correlation functions of
arbitrary order have been calculated analytically with generating function techniques [10, 11, 12, 13]. In terms of
the ultrametric two-point distance, which measures the number of cascade steps necessary to reach the last common
branching, these models reveal rigorous multiscaling. However, in this form, the two-point RMCP statistics cannot be
compared directly to quantities that can be extracted from the data because, from an experimentalist’s perspective,
the two-point correlations are expressed as functions of the Euclidean two-point distance. In this respect, RMCPs are
incomplete and have to be supplemented by model-dependent extensions, stating the conversion of the ultrametric to
Euclidean statistics [14, 15, 16]. It may be expected that this unavoidable conversion will lead to some deviations from
rigorous multiscaling of correlation functions for two-point distances within the inertial range. The challenge is to ﬁnd
the degree to which the theoretical, extended-RMCP, two-point correlation functions can match their experimental
counterparts.

addition, two-point cumulants of logarithmic energy dissipation [15] allow us to access properties of the cascade
generator in another way. Taken together, reliable parametric estimations of the underlying cascade generator can
then be given. This would be the best we can do to achieve a data-driven derivation of the turbulent energy cascade
generator and to settle the question of whether the latter is bimodal [17, 18], log-normal [19, 20], log-stable [21, 22],
log-inﬁnite divisible [23, 24, 25] or another type of distribution. None of those prototype cascade generators has been
directly derived from data.

Note that the breakup coeﬃcients, sometimes called multipliers, have once been thought to represent a direct
approach to derive the RMCP cascade generator from data [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In fact, generator-like scale-invariant
distributions of breakup coeﬃcients have been observed, but conditional distributions have been found to exhibit
scale correlations.
In a series of papers [16, 31, 32] these ﬁndings have been fully explained within ultrametric
hierarchical RMCPs, once those are analyzed from an experimentalist’s perspective, including unavoidable small-
scale resummation and restoration of spatial homogeneity via the ultrametric-Euclidean conversion. This work has
demonstrated that cascade generators and distributions of breakup coeﬃcients are not directly related.

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section II provides basic information about the two-point correlation of the
lowest order for the surrogate energy dissipation in four fully developed turbulent ﬂows—one atmospheric boundary
layer and three wind-tunnel ﬂows. This information serves to provide the needed guidance for the subsequent RMCP
modelling of Sec. III, where analytic expressions for two-point correlators and cumulants are derived, taking into
account the ultrametric-Euclidean conversion. More information on data analysis is provided in Sec. IV, leading in
Sec. V to further comparisons between prototype distributions and experiments. As will also be demonstrated in
this section, the extracted properties of the generator allow us to make parametric estimations of the RMCP cascade
generator. A conclusion and outlook is given in Sec. VI.

II. DATA ANALYSIS I: BASIC FACTS ON TWO-POINT STATISTICS

We analyze four diﬀerent data sets, three of which have been recorded in a wind tunnel [33] and the fourth in an
atmospheric boundary layer [34] about 35 m above the ground. We will refer to them as w1, w2, w3 and a, respectively.
Characteristic quantities of all data sets are summarized in Table I. The Reynolds number Rλ =
λ/ν is based on
i
; ν is the kinematic viscosity and u is the streamwise velocity component.
the Taylor microscale λ =
Upon the application of the frozen ﬂow hypothesis, the recorded time series were converted into one-dimensional spatial
series. The energy spectra of all four records reveal more or less the typical 5/3 slope in the inertial range. In contrast
to wind-tunnel records, that from the atmospheric boundary layer reveals a white-noise behavior at very small scales;
this noise, which comes from detailed electronic circuitry, has been removed by an appropriate Wiener ﬁlter. The
energy dissipation was then calculated as the surrogate amplitude ε = 15ν( du
dx )2. Various tests were made to ensure
that the eﬀect of Wiener ﬁltering were not consequential.

detail elsewhere [35].

For the records with the largest Reynolds number, there is a large scale range for which the two-point correlator
exhibits a rigorous power-law scaling. However, with decreasing Reynolds number this scale range becomes smaller.
As a rule of thumb, we observe that a good scaling range is conﬁned between d
If we
could understand precisely the deviations from the power-law scaling beyond this intermediate inertial range, a more
satisfactory extraction of multiscaling exponents would be possible, especially for turbulent ﬂows with moderate
Reynolds numbers. In the small-distance d
30η region, however, the correlations observed exceed the power-
law extrapolation; consult Fig. 1 again. As has been explained in Ref. [8], this enhancement is a consequence of the
unavoidable surrogacy of the experimentally measured energy dissipation. Without knowing the correct small-distance
behavior based on the proper energy dissipation, a theoretical modelling of two-point correlations in the dissipative
regime is not very meaningful. We are thus left to inspect only the remainder of the inertial range. Fortunately, this
range is suﬃciently large, especially for the atmospheric data.

III. TWO-POINT STATISTICS OF RANDOM MULTIPLICATIVE CASCADE PROCESSES

A. Binary random multiplicative cascade process

In its simplest form an RMCP employs a binary hierarchy of length scales lj = Lcasc/2j. In the ﬁrst cascade step
the parent interval of length l0 = Lcasc is split into left and right daughter intervals, both of length l1. In subsequent
cascade steps, each interval of generation 0
1 is again split into a left and right subinterval of length
lj+1 = lj/2. Once the dissipation scale η = Lcasc/2J is reached, the interval splitting stops and has resulted into 2J
spatially ordered intervals of smallest size η. It is convenient to label them as well as their ancestors according to the
binary notation κ(j) = κ1, κ2, . . . , κj. The label refers to the hierarchical position of an interval of generation j, where
κi = 0 or 1 stands for the left or right interval, respectively.

J

j

The binary interval splittings go together with a probabilistic evolution of the energy-ﬂux ﬁeld. From generation j

to j + 1 the ﬁeld amplitudes propagate locally as

Πκ(j),0 = qκ(j),0Πκ(j) ,
Πκ(j),1 = qκ(j),1Πκ(j) .

The two random multiplicative weights qleft = qκ(j),0 and qright = qκ(j),1, with mean
= 1, are drawn
from a scale-independent bivariate probability density function p(qleft, qright), which is called the cascade generator.
Initially, corresponding to j = 0, the iteration (2) starts with a given large-scale energy ﬂux Π, which might itself be a
random variable ﬂuctuating around its normalized mean
J, the energy-ﬂux

amplitude is interpreted as the amplitude εκ(J) = Πκ(J) of the energy dissipation supported at the interval of length
η at position κ(J). As a result of (2), this amplitude is a multiplicative sum of the random weights, given by

In the following we assume the cascade generator to be of the factorized form p(qleft, qright) = p(qleft)p(qright) with
identical statistics for the left/right variable. Of course, the factorization is not the most general ansatz but, as
already pointed out in Ref. [32], it represents a reasonable approximation: the turbulent energy cascade takes place
in three spatial dimensions and calls for a three-dimensional RMCP modelling, respecting energy conservation. Since
the measured temporal records come from one-dimensional cuts, the three-dimensional RMCP has to be observed in
unity subdimension. Because of this, the RMCP appears to be non-conservative and the two multiplicative weights
appear to be almost decorrelated and independent of each other.

B. Two-point correlators

Expressions for N -point moments

are easily found. They can be calculated either by a
i
straightforward approach or, more formally, by an iterative construction of the respective multivariate characteristic
function [10, 11]; a third and more elegant approach [36] makes use of the full analytic solution of the multivariate
characteristic function for logarithmic cascade-ﬁeld amplitudes [12, 13]. We simply state the results up to two-point
correlations:

For an experimentalist, the expression (7) does not present an observable result. Diﬀerent pairs of bins, all having
an identical Euclidean distance η
d<Lcasc, do not have an unequivocal ultrametric distance. Depending on their
position within the binary ultrametric cascade tree, the two bins might share a cascade history that is long (small D)
or short (large D). Consequently, as an experimentalist analyzes the two-point statistics in terms of d, the ultrametric
expression (7) has to be averaged over all D that contribute to the same value of d. In order to perform this conversion
from an ultrametric to an Euclidean distance and, by this means, to restore spatial homogeneity, we introduce the

will discard these modulations by ﬁrst considering only dyadic distances dm = Lcasc/2m with integer 0

then switching again to continuous d by interpolating between the discrete dm. The expression (10) then simpliﬁes to

IV. DATA ANALYSIS II: MORE ON TWO-POINT STATISTICS

In this section, we provide further aspects of data analysis that are relevant. The goal is three-fold: ﬁrst and
already pointed out in Sect. II, to test the RMCP expression (11) with the proposed ﬁnite-size scaling for two-point
correlators, second, to test the expression (18) for two-point cumulants derived from the RMCP theory, and, third,
to extract reliable values for the scaling exponents τn and cumulants cn from various turbulent records discussed in
Sec. II.

The expressions (11) and (18) come with parameters Lcasc, τn1,n2 , an1,n2, cn and

ic. The parameter Lcasc
depends on neither the order n1, n2 nor the choice of the two-point statistics, i.e., whether we use the correlator or the
cumulant. The ﬁts of (11) and (18) to their counterparts from experimental records have to respect this independence.

In addition to the common parameter Lcasc, the ﬁt of each order has two more parameters: these are τn1,n2 , an1,n2 for
ic for the two-point cumulant. We demonstrate the quality of ﬁts by choosing
the two-point correlator and cn,
the data record w2. For this data set, two-point correlators with orders from n1, n2 = 1, 1 to 2, 2 are illustrated in
Fig. 4, while the two-point cumulants with orders n1, n2 = 1, 1 and 2, 1 are illustrated in Fig. 5. Except for very
small two-point distances η
30η, where, as already noted, the surrogacy eﬀect of the energy dissipation
corrupts the experimental two-point statistics [8], the agreement between the experimental two-point correlators and
cumulants and the best-ﬁt expressions (11) and (18) is remarkable. Table II lists the best-ﬁt parameters Lcasc, τn and
cn. Note that, due to (8) and τ1 = 0, the scaling exponents τn1,n2 have been converted into τ2 = τ1,1, τ3 = τ2,1 + τ2
and τ4 = τ3,1 + τ3 = τ2,2 + 2τ2. For w2 the two values τ4 = 0.79 and 0.77, the ﬁrst value extracted from r3,1(d)
and the second from r2,2(d), are consistent with each other, although the statistical convergence of the two two-point
correlators of order n1 + n2 = 4 is already beyond the limit of acceptability. For the record w3 a similar statement
3. Their best-ﬁt parameters Lcasc,
can be made, but the other records w1 and a are deﬁnitely conﬁned to n1 + n2 ≤
τn and cn are also listed in Table II.

The cumulant c1 cannot be directly extracted from two-point cumulants. However, an indirect extraction is possible
via the relations (23) and (24). Using the numerical values of c2 and c3 determined already, the truncated multifractal
sum rule (23) leads to the c1 values listed in the second-last column of Table 2. Input for the replica-trick formula (24)
are the scaling exponents τ1, τ2 and τ3 determined already. The application of a cubic spline for the extrapolation
results in the last column of Table 2. If a linear spline is used instead, the resulting c1 values of the records w1, w2, w3
shift closer to the values of the second-last column, but would do worse for the record a. For an order-of-magnitude
estimate, however, it is safe to say that c1 ≈
This comparison of the RMCP theory with data demonstrates that the parameter Lcasc is a meaningful quantity and
deserves some fundamental consideration. For two-point distances 20
Lcasc, the ﬁtted expressions (11) and
(18) are in good qualitative agreement with their experimental counterparts. At d = Lcasc all two-point correlations
decorrelate and become identical to their asymptotic values corresponding to d
; Lcasc > L is somewhat larger
than the operationally deﬁned integral length L of Table I, which is calculated as the correlation length of the velocity
autocorrelation function. The physical interpretation of the extracted parameter Lcasc is that of a turbulent cascade
length which, according to Fig. 2, describes the spatial extension of a hierarchical RMCP domain.

The ﬁnite-size scaling fn1,n2(d/Lcasc) of two-point correlators, predicted by RMCP, now allows for an unambiguous
derivation of scaling exponents, even for fully developed turbulent ﬂows with a moderate Reynolds number. Conse-
quently, as a closer inspection of Table II shows, reliable statements that the intermittency exponent τ2 might show
a weak dependence on the Reynolds number appear to be within reach. Of course, to make this statement solid, the
analysis of many more records is needed; this eﬀort will be reported in [35].

V. PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF THE RMCP GENERATOR

If the scaling exponents τn, or the cumulants cn, exist and are known for all orders 1

, the binary RMCP
generator could in principle be reconstructed via the inverse transform of (21). Unfortunately, as we have seen in the
previous section, reliable information is limited to the lowest orders. Hence, the best we can do is to use sophisticated
parametric estimates. Section V.A lists some of the most popular parametrizations and compares their performance
with the results listed in Table II. Section V.B introduces the so-called log-normal inverse Gaussian distribution
[40, 41], which represents a broader and more ﬂexible parametrization class, with the purpose of ﬁnding a suitable
approximation to the true cascade generator.

since the cumulants cn do not exist for this distribution beyond some order. For comparison, we will also employ the

which was originally derived with ν1 = 2 and ν2 = 2/3 from some plausible reasoning on the structure of the most
singular objects in fully developed turbulent ﬂows [23, 24, 25].

For all parametrizations (26)–(30) it is straightforward to determine analytic expressions for the scaling exponents
and cumulants via (20)–(22). The free parameter of the one-parametric distributions (26)–(28) is then ﬁxed to
reproduce the observed intermittency exponent τ2, listed in Table II. The two-parametric distributions (29) and (30)
need also conform to τ3 in addition to τ2. No further freedom is left for the scaling exponents of higher order and
cumulants of all orders. Table III summarizes their predicted values.

It is diﬃcult to rate the prototype cascade generators because of ambiguity inherent in the data. Within the one-
parametric distributions (26)-(28) the log-normal distribution performs better: for all the records, the predicted values
for c1 and c2 are close to the observed cumulants. However, the log-normal distribution without skewness is unable
to reproduce the observed positive values for c3 and for the record w2 it also overestimates the scaling exponent τ4.
Furthermore, the diﬃculties of the log-normal distribution for high-order moments is now well known [2]. Compared to
the log-normal distribution, the rescaled gamma distribution and the asymmetric beta distribution have the tendency
to overestimate the ﬁrst two cumulants. Furthermore, c3 is predicted with an opposite sign. Rather surprisingly, the
simple two-parametric bimodal distribution (29) shows the closest agreement for all records. The scaling exponent
τ4, if observed, as well as the cumulants c1 and c2 almost match their observed counterparts. Moreover, c3 comes
with the correct sign, although it is about a factor 2 too low for the records w1, w2, w3 and roughly a factor 2 too
large for the atmospheric boundary layer record. Like the distributions (27) and (28), the two-parametric log-Poisson
distribution overestimates the second cumulant c2 and, except for record w3, predicts c3 with the wrong sign. It is
interesting to note that the parameter-free log-Poisson distribution [23] with ν1 = 2 and ν2 = 2/3 matches well the
scaling exponents τ3 and τ4 of record a with the largest Reynolds number, but disagrees with all cumulants.

B. Log-normal inverse Gaussian distribution

A broader and more ﬂexible parametrization class is the so-called normal inverse Gaussian distribution [40, 41]

For each of the records w1, w2, w3 and a, the four NIG parameters α, β, δ and µ are determined so as to reproduce
τ1 = 0 and the observed values for τ2, τ3 and c2 listed in Table II. Since the respective expressions (35) and (36)
are nonlinear, real solutions for the parameters are not guaranteed. Where complex-valued solutions resulted in the
ﬁrst attempt, which occurred for w2, w3 and a, the values for c2, τ3 and τ2 are relaxed, in this order and to some
small extent, until real-valued parameter solutions are obtained. The outcome is listed in Table IV. The results are
very close to the log-normal values listed in III. The log-normal inverse Gaussian distribution has the tendency to
overestimate the fourth-order scaling exponent τ4. The magnitude of the third cumulant c3 is strongly underestimated,
so that its predicted sign shows only random scatter. Figure 6 compares the extracted log-normal inverse Gaussian
distributions of Table IV with the extracted log-normal distributions of Table III. For all four records the extracted
distributions are very similar.

As a summary of this section, we reiterate that the bimodal distribution (29) produces the best overall agreement
with the observed scaling exponents and cumulants. However, the true cascade generator will not be discrete. From
the set of continuous generator representatives tested, the log-normal and log-normal inverse Gaussian distributions
perform best and about equally well.

VI. CONCLUSION

Random multiplicative cascade processes are able to describe the observed two-point correlation structure of the
surrogate energy dissipation of fully developed turbulent ﬂows beyond simple power-law scaling. Keeping in mind the
need for a satisfactory comparison between modelling and experimental data, a useful transformation has been intro-
duced: this transformation converts model-dependent and unobservable ultrametric two-point distances to Euclidean
two-point distances, the latter reﬂecting the horizontally sampled n-point statistics of the experimental records. The
predictions of RMCP for ﬁnite-size scaling of two-point correlation functions are conﬁrmed by experimental data
from three (wind tunnel) shear ﬂows and one atmospheric boundary layer; a new physical length scale characterizing
the upper end of the inertial range, called here the turbulent cascade length, has been shown to appear naturally.
Furthermore, the quantitative classiﬁcation of the deviations from a rigorous scaling of two-point correlators allows
for an unambiguous extraction of multiscaling exponents, even for ﬂows with moderate Reynolds numbers. When
complemented with additional information extracted from two-point cumulants of the logarithmic energy dissipation,
reliable parametric estimates of the RMCP generator have become feasible.

RMCPs produce a consistent geometrical modelling of the self-similar turbulent energy cascade. This is further
supported by recent investigations on the scaling part of three-point statistics [42] and previous investigations on scale
correlations [16, 31, 32, 43]. Thus, the self-similar and RMCP-like cascade process appears to be universal. However,
as shown by variations among the four records considered, the strength of the cascade generator appears to depend
on the Reynolds number and perhaps also the ﬂow geometry. This needs further clariﬁcation by means of a separate
and extended eﬀort [35]; needless to say, there is a strong need for the experimentalists to produce clean and longer
records with converged statistics.

FIG. 4: Best ﬁts of expression (11) to two-point correlators extracted from data set w2. Correlation orders are n1, n2 = 1, 1,
2, 1, 3, 1 and 2, 2. The parameter Lcasc has been ﬁtted such that it is the same for all orders of two-point correlators as well as
two-point cumulants, with the latter illustrated in Fig. 5. The inset ﬁgures illustrate the local slope. For comparison, power-law
ﬁts with the extracted scaling exponents listed in Tab. II are shown as the shifted dashed straight lines.

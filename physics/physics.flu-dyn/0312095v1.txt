Abstract

In this work we estimate rates of the linear transient growth of the
perturbations of cellular ﬂames governed by the Sivashinsky equation.
The possibility and signiﬁcance of such a growth was indicated ear-
lier in both computational and analytical investigations. Numerical
investigation of the norm of the resolvent of the linear operator asso-
ciated with the Sivashinsky equation linearized in a neighbourhood of
the steady coalescent pole solution was undertaken. The results are
presented in the form of the pseudospectra and the lower bound of
possible transient ampliﬁcation. This ampliﬁcation is strong enough
to make the round-oﬀ errors visible in the numerical simulations in
the form of small cusps appearing on the ﬂame surface randomly in
time. Performance of available numerical approaches was compared
to each other and the results are checked versus directly calculated
norms of the evolution operator.

Key words: nonnormal operator, pseudospectra, nonmodal ampliﬁcation,

Here N is an arbitrary positive integer and prime in the symbol of summation
means m
= n. Pairs of real numbers (an, bn), n = 1, . . . , N are called poles
and, correspondingly, function (2) is called N-pole1 solution to (1). It is also
convenient to consider Φ(x, t)

const as a 0-pole solution to (1).

If all the poles in (3), (4) are steady and an = a

R for n = 1, . . . , N,
then, (2) is called a steady coalescent N-pole solution. Solutions of the latter
type, denoted here as ΦN (x) and illustrated in Fig. 2, have been found to
be the strongest attractors of (1) and the period L preferred by (1) has
appeared to coincide with the size of the whole computational domain which
we therefore denote as [

L/2, L/2], see e.g. [3].

It was shown, see for example [4], that for a given period L the num-
ber of poles in steady coalescent pole solution (2) may not exceed NL =
ceil(γL/8π + 1/2)
1, where ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater or equal
to x. Direct numerical simulations have revealed, in turn, that for suﬃ-
ciently small values of L < Lc the preferred number of poles is equal NL.
This observation was explained in [5] by means of the eigenvalue analysis
of (1) linearized in a neighbourhood of the steady coalescent pole solutions.
The analysis has indicated that for any L > 0 the steady coalescent NL-pole
solution is the only steady coalescent N-pole solution to (1) with all the
eigenvalues located in the left half of the complex plane. Strictly speaking,
[5] does not provide a solid proof that their set of eigenvalues is complete
and in this paper we explain why the comparison with the direct numerical
calculation of the spectra, used in [5], cannot justify the completeness, in
particular for large enough L.

Surprisingly, for larger computational domains L > Lc, numerical solu-
tions to (1) do not stabilize to any steady coalescent N-pole solution at all.
Instead, being essentially nonsteady, they remain very closely to the steady
coalescent NL-pole solution, developing on the surface of the ﬂame front
ibn.
However, we follow the tradition and keep this natural deﬁnition, as only real solutions
are of interest.

small cusps randomly in time, see e.g. [6]. With time these small cusps move
towards the trough of the ﬂame front proﬁle and disappear in it as this is
shown in Fig. 2.

The high sensitivity of pole solutions to certain perturbations was sug-
gested in [7] as an explanation of the cardinal change in the behaviour of
numerical solutions to (1) which takes place for L = Lc. The argument of
[7] was based on a particular asymptotic solution to an approximation of
the Sivashinsky equation linearized in a neighbourhood of the steady coa-
lescent N-pole solution. In the following works, see e.g.
[8], the approach
has been developed further and a model equation with stochastic right hand
side, explicitly representing the noise, has been proposed and investigated.
Sensitivity of Sivashinsky equation to the noise has also been studied in [9],
and an estimation of dependence between Lc and the amplitude of noise in
the form of the the round-oﬀ errors has been obtained in [6] in a series of
direct numerical simulations.

Similar insuﬃciency of the eigenvalue analysis to interpret time depen-
dent behaviour of asymptotically stable systems is also known from prob-
lems of classic hydrodynamics, such as Poiseuille and Hagen-Poiseuille ﬂows
[10]. The failure of the spectral analysis in these problems was linked to the

4

nonorthogonality of the eigenfunctions of the associated linearized operators
and was explained by the estimation of possible transient growth of pertur-
bations [11], [12]. A convenient tool to estimate possible transient growth
of solutions governed by nonnormal operators were developed during the
last decade in the form of the pseudospectra [13]. Corresponding numerical
techniques have been reviewed in [14].

In this work we estimate rates of the linear transient growth of the pertur-
bations of the steady coalescent NL-pole solutions to the Sivashinsky equa-
tion. In Section 2 we linearize the equation in a neighbourhood of the steady
coalescent pole solution. In Section 3, results of direct computations of the
pseudospectra of the linear operator are presented. Also, a comparison of
performance of available numerical techniques is given. Estimation of the
rates of growth in terms of Kreiss constants, norms of the C0-semigroup and
condition numbers, are presented in Section 4. We conclude with a discussion
and a summary of results in Section 5.

An alternative algorithm is based on projection to the interesting sub-

was suggested in [14] in the form of a Matlab script and is, on average, about
two times faster than inverse iterations with continuation. Further, our tests
have shown that its eﬃciency degrades much slower as the matrix size or
required accuracy grows. Thus, Schur factorization with Lanczos iterations
was the algorithm of our choice. It was intensively monitored by the direct
SVD, however.

is not responsible for high sensitivity of the steady coalescent pole solutions
to the noise. The latter conclusion is reinforced by the comparison of the

One may see that the only eﬀect of the projection is a small shift of the

corresponding curve in Fig. 6b.

5 Comparison of the estimations

It was established in numerical experiments, see e.g.
[3], [4], that for small
enough computational domains of size L < Lc numerical solutions of (1)
stabilize to the steady coalescent NL-pole solutions of (1). This observation
is in the explicit agreement with the eigenvalue analysis of the linearized
problem carried out in [5].

For larger L > Lc, numerical solutions do not stabilize to any steady
solution at all. Instead, being essentially nonsteady, they remain very closely
to the steady coalescent NL-pole solution, developing on the surface of the
ﬂame front small cusps randomly in time. With time these small cusps move
towards the trough of the ﬂame front proﬁle and disappear in it as can be
seen in Fig. 2.

Numerous numerical experiments did not reveal any signiﬁcant depen-
dence of the critical length Lc on parameters of the computational algorithm.

18

They have shown, however, that Lc is eﬀectively aﬀected by the round-oﬀ
errors [6]. Thus, if f is the order of the amplitude of perturbations associated
with the round-oﬀ errors, then Lc = Lc(f ). Two values of Lc(f ) obtained
in our calculations with 32- and 64-bit arithmetic are shown in Fig. 9. Am-
plitude f of the perturbations was of the order of machine zeros, i.e. 10−7
and 10−16 correspondingly. Note, that in calculations with 32-bit arithmetic
round-oﬀ errors dominated discretization errors [20].

Figure 9: Dependence of the variety of measures of the critical strength fc

It is convenient to invert the relation Lc = Lc(f ) and write it in the
form fc = fc(L), where fc is a critical noise strength for given size L of the
ﬂame. Reciprocal of the Kreiss constant
KAN , obtained in Section 4.1, can
be considered as the lower bound of this critical strength fc of perturbations
for any particular value of L. Here, the strength of the perturbation means
its 2-norm. Corresponding graph is plotted in Fig. 9. It is in a very good
agreement with the results of our direct numerical simulations. The graph of

versus L is also given in Fig. 9, for the illustrative purposes. We

(17)

Here RN = (∂2ΦN /∂x2)−1 is calculated in the crest of the steady coalescent
N-pole solution, see Fig. 2. In [7] a particular asymptotic solution to (17)
has been investigated. As a result, the dependence between the critical value
of curvature radius RN in the crest of the ﬂame proﬁle and the spectral
density ρf of the most dangerous harmonics of φ(x, 0) has been obtained. A
functional link between L and RNL of the steady coalescent NL-pole solution
to the Sivashinsky equation can be easily established yielding

ρf,c = 4−1γ2e−γ2(c1L+c2)/8.

(18)

Here c1 and c2 are coeﬃcients of the least squares ﬁtting of RNL = RNL(L)
with a straight line c1L + c2.

When comparing our results with estimation (18), the following should
be taken into account. First, relation (18) has been obtained for the spectral
density of the most dangerous harmonics of the perturbation φ(x, 0) rather
than for its amplitude f . Second, assumptions made to obtain (18) are better
justiﬁed for large L. The last but not least factor is that (18) is based on
a particular solution and is likely to produce an overestimated value of ρf,c
rather than the optimal one. In view of these peculiarities, the agreement
between (18), obtained in [7], and our estimations is striking.

In contrast, the estimation of fc obtained in [9] is obviously out of the
harmony. That estimation was based on studies of the dynamics of poles
governed by (3), (4). Namely, the amplitude of perturbations to the solutions
of (1) was linked to the b-coordinate of poles in the (a, b)-plane. Then,
analysis of the dynamics of these noise generated poles yields the estimation

fc = 211π6γ−5L−6.

(19)

There is no doubt that the sensitivity of system (3), (4) to noise is totally
diﬀerent of what we have for (1). Analysis of the Jacobian of the right hand
sides of system (3), (4) for the steady coalescent NL-pole solution reveals that
this is a symmetric matrix and there is no linear nonmodal ampliﬁcation of
noise in (3), (4) at all. For small L, when the nonmodal ampliﬁcation is
not essential, estimation (19) is in a good agreement with other data indeed.
However, for larger L, the discrepancy between the results of [9] and of others,
clearly seen in Fig. 9, can be interpreted as the measure of the importance of
the linear nonmodal ampliﬁcation of perturbations in the Sivashinsky equa-
tion.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have undertaken the numerical analysis of norms of the resol-
vent of the linear operator associated with the Sivashinsky equation linearized
in a neighbourhood of the steady coalescent pole solutions. Performance of
available numerical techniques was compared to each other and the results
are checked versus directly calculated norms of the evolution operator.

The studies demonstrated the robustness of the approach by resolving the
problem of stability of certain types of cellular ﬂames. They showed that the
round-oﬀ errors are the only eﬀect relevant to the appearance of the micro
cusps in computations of large enough ﬂames. These essentially nonlinear
micro cusps are generated through the huge linear nonmodal transitional
ampliﬁcation of the round-oﬀ errors. Their ﬁnal appearance and dynamics
on the ﬂame surface is governed by essentially nonlinear mechanisms intrinsic
to the Sivashinsky equation.

In order to retain its physical meaning for large ﬂames, Sivashinsky equa-
tion should be reﬁned by accounting for the physical noise, e.g. in the way
suggested in [8].

Abstract

Our velocity measurements on a quasi-two-dimensional turbulent ﬂow in a
rapidly rotating annulus yield an inverse cascade with E(k) ∼ k−2 rather than
the expected E(k) ∼ k−5/3. The probability distribution functions for lon-
gitudinal velocity diﬀerences, δv(r) = v(x + r) − v(x), are self-similar (scale
independent) but strongly non-Gaussian, which suggests that the coherent
vortices play a signiﬁcant role. The structure functions, h[δv(r)]pi ∼ rζp, ex-
hibit anomalous scaling: ζp = p
3 as in the 1941 Kolmogorov
theory.

Kolmogorov’s 1941 theory of turbulence (K41) assumes self-similarity of a homogeneous,
isotropic turbulent ﬂow, that is, the statistics of the diﬀerence between velocities measured
at two points, δv(r) = v(x+r)−v(x) (where v is along the line connecting the two points) are
independent of the separation r. Self-similarity can also be determined from the scaling of
structure functions, Sp(r) ≡< [δv(r)]p >∼ rζp; for any self-similar ﬂow, ζp will vary linearly
with p [1]. In particular, Kolmogorov theory predicts the existence of an inertial range with
power law scaling with ζp = p
3.

Experiments and numerical simulations have shown that three-dimensional (3D) turbu-
lence is not self-similar [1]. The observed deviations from a linear dependence of ζp on p
are attributed to the stretching and folding of vortices. As a vortex stretches, it shrinks in
lateral extent until it collapses onto a singular line. Consequently, the dissipation rate varies
with length scale.

Since vortex stretching is not allowed in two dimensions, self-similarity of 2D turbulence
is a separate question from self-similarity of 3D turbulence. The tendency of 2D ﬂows to
form large coherent vortices could produce intermittent rather than self-similar statistics.
However, a recent numerical simulation of 2D turbulence suggests self-similar behavior [2]
(see also [3,4]). Three recent experiments [5–7] have given diﬀering answers to the question
of self-similarity in 2D turbulent ﬂows. Measurements on a magnetically driven shallow
ﬂuid layer yielded a clear inverse energy cascade, and self-similar behavior was indicated
by both the Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for δv and by the scaling of the
structure function [5]. The PDFs were Gaussian throughout the inertial range, and structure
functions yielded ζp = p/3, in accord with the K41 prediction. In contrast, two experiments
on turbulence in soap ﬁlms yielded intermittent rather than self-similar ﬂow [6,7]. In one
experiment the PDFs changed in shape from stretched exponentials at small separations to
Gaussian at large separations, and it was concluded that “the simultaneous presence of both
inverse energy and forward enstrophy cascades appears necessary to observe intermittency
in 2D turbulence [7].”

Here we report on experiments that use rotation to two-dimensionalize a continuously
driven turbulent ﬂow. We observe both an inverse energy cascade and a forward enstrophy
cascade; the latter will be discussed elsewhere. The inverse cascade dynamics are charac-
terized by a family of scale-invariant PDFs for δv that have a strongly non-Gaussian shape.
Log-log plots of the pth-order structure functions Sp(r) as a function of S3(r) (a method
called Extended Self-Similarity (ESS) [8]) shows the Kolmogorov behavior, ζp = p/3; this
scaling must follow for self-similar ﬂows if ζp=0 = 0. However, our graphs of Sp as a function
of r suggest ζp = p/2, conﬁrming self-similar behavior with no intermittency, but contrasting
with the Kolmogorov prediction. We now describe the experiments and then present the
results.

Our apparatus consists of an annular tank ﬁlled with water and covered with a solid
lid; the inner diameter of the tank is 21.6 cm and the outer diameter is 86.4 cm [9]. Flow
in the annulus is produced by continuously pumping water in a closed circuit through two
concentric rings of 120 holes each in the bottom of the tank; the source ring is at 18.9
cm and the sink ring is at 35.1 cm. The radially outward ﬂux couples with the Coriolis
force to generate a counter-rotating jet, which is wide and turbulent over a wide range of
parameters [9]. The rapid rotation leads by the Taylor-Proudman theorem to a ﬂow that is
essentially 2D except in the thin Ekman boundary layers at the top and bottom surfaces [9].

2

The bottom of the tank is conical, increasing in depth from 17.1 cm at the inner radius to
20.3 cm at the outer radius; this sloping “beta plane”, a ﬁrst order approximation of the
variation of the Coriolis force with latitude, breaks the symmetry between co-rotating and
counter-rotating jets.

In the present experiments the tank rotates at 11.0 rad/s, suﬃciently fast to produce
essentially 2D ﬂow, and the ﬂux is 150 cm3/s, suﬃciently large to produce an inverse energy
cascade. The azimuthal velocity is measured using hot ﬁlm probes which are inserted through
the top lid and extend 1 cm into the water on opposite sides of the tank, midway between
the inner and outer walls. Each probe was sampled at 150 Hz for periods of two hours,
giving 106 data points per probe for each run, and the measurements were repeated four
times, yielding a total of 8 × 106 data points. Using the maximum velocity (Umax = 22
cm/s) as the velocity scale and the distance between the forcing rings (L = 16.2 cm) as
the integral length scale, we calculate the Reynolds number to be 35 000 and the Rossby
number (Umax/2ΩL, where Ω is the rotation rate) to be 0.05.

Instantaneous 2D velocity ﬁelds were obtained using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
system with a horizontal light sheet at mid-ﬂuid depth and a rotating camera above the
tank. For each ﬂow condition, 50 instantaneous velocity ﬁelds were obtained, equivalent to
approximately 2 × 105 velocity values at the radius of the hot ﬁlm probes. Though this
sample size is inadequate for higher order statistics, the spatial information provided by the
PIV measurements complements the long velocity time series obtained with the hot ﬁlm
probes. We also consider PIV measurements at the same rotation rate at a higher pumping
rate of 550 cm3/s (Re = 100 000).

Two vorticity proﬁles obtained with the PIV system are shown in Fig. 1. When the
pump is ﬁrst turned on, the ﬂow consists of rings of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic vortices that
form above the outlet and inlet rings, respectively. Vortices of like sign immediately begin
merging and growing in size, and an anticyclonic jet forms between the two rings. At long
times the inverse energy cascade leads to large vortices; the vortices are larger at higher
pumping rates, as Fig. 1 illustrates.

We compute energy power spectra from the velocity time series data assuming Taylor’s
frozen turbulence hypothesis, which is applicable because the turbulent intensity (ratio of
the rms velocity ﬂuctuation to the mean velocity) is less than 10%. The spectra contain a
region with E(k) ∼ k−2 (Fig. 2), in contrast with Kraichnan’s prediction of E(k) ∼ k−5/3
for the inverse cascade [10]. From the PIV data for the higher pumping rate, energy spectra
for the azimuthal velocity at the probe radius show a scaling consistent with those obtained
from the time series data, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. At high wavenumbers, the power
spectra are consistent with the previously observed E(k) ∼ k−n, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 4 for the
forward (enstrophy) cascade [1], but our spectral range is too small to deduce an exponent
value.

The histogram of the velocity diﬀerences δv(r) in Fig. 3 demonstrates self-similar behav-
ior: data for diﬀerent separations r collapse onto a single curve. The velocity diﬀerences are
normalized by their standard deviation (δv)rms and the probability by its maximum value,
Pmax. The velocity diﬀerences for both the forward and inverse cascades fall on a single curve,
which is far from Gaussian, in contrast to the observations for other quasi-two-dimensional
ﬂows [5–7] but in accord with a recent numerical simulation of 2D turbulence [2]. The en-
hanced probability in the tails of our PDF is likely due to the strong velocity diﬀerences

3

that arise as coherent vortices pass the probes, as noted by She et al. [11].

We have shown that the energy spectrum scales anomalously, that is, diﬀerent from K41
theory (Fig. 2). Another indication of anomalous behavior is the scaling of the standard
deviation of the velocity diﬀerences, δvrms. Our data suggest δv(r) ∼ r0.5 for both pumping
rates (cf. insets of Fig. 3) rather than the δv(r) ∼ r of K41 theory.

Now we examine the higher order structure functions, plotting Sp as a function of r, as
shown in Fig. 4(a). There is a scaling region (labeled A) from about 2 cm to 8 cm, and
some indication of another scaling region (labeled B) for r < 2 cm; the transition between
the two regions can be seen more clearly in the plot of S10/r5.5 vs. r in the inset.

The location of the transition in the structure functions (2 cm) does not agree with
the transition (at 5 cm) in the energy spectra of Fig. 2. However, the region where the two
disagree is the range where the measurements from our two hot ﬁlm probes begin to disagree
with each other. The presence of spurious peaks in this range as well as the disagreement
with the PIV scaling, point to a bias in the hot ﬁlm measurements that is ampliﬁed by the
correlation function, but to which the velocity diﬀerences are insensitive. This bias might
come from a systematic error due to the calibration of the hot ﬁlm probes, which would
cancel out when diﬀerences are taken, but which would be ampliﬁed by the correlation. It
is also possible that the scaling regions do not exactly coincide, as discussed in [1] (p. 62).
One test for the existence of an inverse energy cascade in 2D turbulence is the
sign of S3(r): Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfths law can be written for anisotropic ﬂows as ε =
− 1
4 ∇rh|δv(r)|2δv(r)i (v is the full 3D velocity vector, and ε is the mean rate of energy
[1], p. 88). For the three-dimensional forward cascade ε is positive; a neg-
transfer) (Ref.
ative value of ε corresponds to an inverse cascade. If the anisotrophy is not too strong the
longitudinal S3 dominates the transverse S3, and one can obtain the sign of ε from measure-
ments of the longitudinal structure function alone. In our ﬂows, S3 > 0 up to r ≃ 10 cm,
which suggests that the inverse energy cascade stops at that point. This length corresponds
visually to the scale of the largest vortices seen in the ﬂow ﬁeld. Thus region A corresponds
to the inverse cascade. Region B corresponds to lengths smaller than the distance (2 cm)
between the forcing holes in the outer ring and may correspond to the forward enstrophy
cascade.

The now standard way of extracting structure function exponents from data with limited
inertial range is the technique introduced by Benzi et al. [8] called Extended Self Similarity
(ESS), where the ζp values are given by the slope of log-log plots of Sp vs. S3. The ESS plots
of our data, Fig. 4(b), exhibit power law scaling through both ranges A and B, for lengths
0.5 < r < 15 cm. Since S3 should contain the same trends as the other structure functions,
it is not surprising that the switching from region A to B is lost by this method.

The exponent values ζp deduced from the plot of Sp [region A in Fig. 4(a)] and from the
ESS plot [Fig. 4(b)] are compared in Fig. 5 with the K41 prediction, ζp = p/3. Figure 4(a)
yields (in region A), ζp,A = p/2, in contrast with theory, although ζp,ESS = p/3, as it
must if the ﬂow is self-similar. Previous experiments on quasi-2D ﬂows have not found a
well deﬁned scaling region for Sp with r.
In applying ESS the magnetically driven ﬂuid
experiment yielded ζp = p/3, as we found, but the soap ﬁlm experiments [6,7] obtained a
strong departure from linearity for ζp.

In summary, a quasi-two-dimensional turbulent ﬂow generated by strong rotation is
found to be self-similar but to exhibit anomalous scaling of the energy, E(k) ∼ k−2, and the

4

structure function, Sp ∼ rp/2. A possible explanation of the p/2 scaling may be a a merging
driven by the radial velocity shear, independent of the azimuthal velocity ﬂuctuations. This
merging would yield an inverse energy ﬂux ε ∼ δvs(δvk)2/r where vs might be the shear
velocity, vk the azimuthal velocity and r the azimuthal separation. For a scale-invariant
ε, the resulting pth order velocity structure function would have the scaling exponent p/2.
Although the anomalous scaling is also seen in the slope of the energy spectrum (Fig. 2), it
is missed if one only conducts an Extended Self Similarity analysis.

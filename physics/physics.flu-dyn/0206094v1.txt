LARGE TIME BEHAVIOR FOR VORTEX EVOLUTION IN
THE HALF-PLANE

Abstract. In this article we study the long-time behavior of incompressible ideal ﬂow in a half
plane from the point of view of vortex scattering. Our main result is that certain asymptotic states
for half-plane vortex dynamics decompose naturally into a nonlinear superposition of soliton-like
states. Our approach is to combine techniques developed in the study of vortex conﬁnement with
weak convergence tools in order to study the asymptotic behavior of a self-similar rescaling of
a solution of the incompressible 2D Euler equations on a half plane with compactly supported,
nonnegative initial vorticity.

Key words: Incompressible and ideal ﬂuid ﬂow, vortex dynamics, 2D Euler equations.

1. Introduction

Let ω = ω(t, x) be the vorticity associated to a solution of the incompressible two-
dimensional Euler equations on the upper half-plane with an initial vorticity ω0 which is
bounded, compactly supported and nonnegative. We consider a rescaling W = W (t, x) =
t2ω(t, tx), whose time-asymptotic behavior encodes information on the scattering of ω into

traveling wave solutions of the 2D Euler system on the half-plane. This choice of rescaling
was also made in view of the fact that the horizontal velocity of the center of vorticity is
bounded away from zero from below (see [11]). The rescaling W is weakly compact as a
time-dependent family of measures. The main purpose of this work is to present a structure
theorem, stating that if the rescaling W is actually weakly convergent to a measure then
miδ(x1 − αi) ⊗ δ(x2), with mi > 0, αi a discrete set of
this measure must be of the form
points on an interval of the form [0, M] whose only possible accumulation point is x1 = 0,
P
and where δ denotes the one-dimensional Dirac measure centered at 0.

Let us begin with a precise formulation of vortex dynamics on the half-plane. Let
(x1, x2) be the coordinates of a point x in the plane and denote the upper half-plane
by H ≡ {x2 > 0}. The initial-boundary value problem for the incompressible 2D Euler
equations in H is given by:

(1.1)

ωt + u · ∇ω = 0, in (0, ∞) × H
div u = 0, in [0, ∞) × H
curl u = ω, in [0, ∞) × H
u2(t, x1, 0) = 0, on [0, ∞) × R
ω(0, x1, x2) = ω0(x1, x2) at {t = 0} × H,

with u = (u1, u2) the velocity and ω the vorticity of the ﬂow.

For bounded, compactly supported initial vorticity, problem (1.1) is equivalent to the
full plane problem with initial vorticity given by an odd extension of ω0 to {x2 < 0} (see
[17] for details). Global well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem follows from
this equivalence, using Yudovich’s Theorem [37]. For compactly supported initial vorticity
in (L1 + BM +) ∩ H −1
loc we have global existence of weak solutions by adapting Delort’s
Theorem to the half-plane case, see [4, 17, 33, 35], but uniqueness is open.

The present work is best understood within the context of research on vorticity conﬁne-
ment. Let ω = ω(t, x) be a (classical) solution of the full plane 2D Euler equations such
that ω(0, x) is compactly supported. The problem of conﬁnement of vorticity is to under-
stand the spreading of the support of ω(t, ·) for large time. The main result in conﬁnement
of vorticity states that if the initial vorticity is nonnegative, with support contained in the
ball B(0; R0), then for any a > 1/4 there exists b > 0 such that the support of vorticity
at time t is contained in a ball of radius R(t) = (bt + R1/a
)a. This result is due to C.
Marchioro [18] for a = 1
4 in [13] and [34]. This area has seen
substantial recent activity, mostly in the direction of extending or generalizing Marchioro’s
original work, see [1, 10, 11, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

Results on conﬁnement of vorticity are rigorous actualizations of the rough idea that
single signed 2D vorticity tends to rotate around, but not to spread out. This is false if the
vorticity is not single signed, which can be seen by considering the behavior of vortex pairs,
vorticity conﬁgurations that tend to translate to inﬁnity with constant speed due to their
self-induced velocity, see [13] for a speciﬁc smooth example. Due to the traveling wave
behavior of vortex pairs, vorticity scattering in two dimensions may become complicated,
and interesting, when vorticity is allowed to change sign. Recently, the authors have

2

R

proved a new result on conﬁnement of vorticity in this context. Let ω = ω(t, x) be a
solution of incompressible 2D Euler in the full plane, with compactly supported but not
necessarily single signed initial data ω0 and let M =
ω0. For any a > 0, deﬁne the
rescaling W (t, x) ≡ t2aω(t, tax). We have proved that if a > 1/2 then W (t, ·) converges
weakly to Mδ. This means conﬁnement, in a weak sense, of the net vorticity in a region
with roughly square-root in time growth in its diameter. This result will appear in a
forthcoming article by the authors, [12]. From the point of view of scattering, this result
accounts for the behavior of the net vorticity, but says very little about the behavior of
vortex pairs, because these tend to be weakly self-canceling when looked at from a large
spatial scale. It one wants to study vortex scattering, the relevant information is the large-
time behavior of |W (t, ·)|, mainly in the case a = 1. The present article is directed precisely
at this problem, with the simplifying assumption that the vorticity be odd with respect to
a straight line, single-signed on each side of the symmetry line. Another way of expressing
this is to say that in this article will study the scattering of co-axial, unidirectional vortex
pairs.

Let ω = ω(t, x) be the solution of the half-plane problem (1.1) deﬁned for all time,
associated to initial data ω0, which we assume, for simplicity, to be smooth, compactly
supported and nonnegative. A conﬁnement result proved by Iftimie in [11], together with
what we will prove here implies that the support of ω(t, ·) is contained in a rectangle of the
form (a1 − b1tα, ct) × (0, a2 + b2tβ), with ai real constants, bi, c > 0 and 0 ≤ α, β < 1. We
wish to examine the asymptotic behavior of the vorticity on the linearly growing horizontal
scale that is naturally associated with the motion of vortex pairs. The approach we use
is inspired on work on the asymptotic behavior of solutions of systems of conservation
ω(t, x) ≡ t2ω(t, tx). The function
laws due to G. Q. Chen and H. Frid, see [3]. Let
ω has bounded L1 norm and will be shown to have support in a rectangle of the form
(−b1tα−1, c) × (0, b2tβ−1). Hence the family of measures {
ω(t, ·)}t>0 is weak-∗ precompact
e
and any weak limit of subsequences of this family is of the form µ⊗δ0, with µ a nonnegative
measure supported on the interval [0, c]. We will refer to such a measure µ as an asymptotic
velocity density. Our main result may be stated in the following way.

e

e

Theorem 1.1. Suppose that the initial data ω0 for problem (1.1) is such that there exists
a unique asymptotic velocity density µ, i.e.,
ω(t, ·) ⇀ µ ⊗ δ0 when t → ∞. Then µ is the
sum of an at most countable set of Diracs whose supports may only accumulate at zero.

The proof involves writing the PDE for the evolution of

ω and using the a priori es-
timates available and the structure of the nonlinearity in a way that is characteristic of
weak convergence methods, see [9]. We will brieﬂy discuss the physical meaning of both
ω(t, ·) converges weakly and the conclusion regarding the structure of
the hypothesis that
µ.

The study of the wavelike behavior of vortex pairs goes back to Pocklington in [30],
with more recent interest going back to work of Norbury, Deem and Zabusky and Pier-
rehumbert, see [5, 26, 29]. The existence (and abundance) of steady vortex pairs, which
are traveling wave solution of the 2D incompressible Euler equations, i.e. vorticity shapes

e

e

which propagate with constant speed without deforming, has been established in the liter-
ature in several ways, see [2, 14, 26]. Steady vortex pairs have been object of an extensive
literature, from asymptotic studies, see [36] and numerical studies, see [31] and even exper-
imental work, see [8]. Although some analytical results (see [25]) and numerical evidence,
[27], point to the orbital stability of steady vortex pairs under appropriate conditions, this
stability is an interesting, largely open problem, see [32].

Compactly supported vortex pairs interact in a way such that the intensity of the inter-
action decays with the inverse of the square of the distance between them. Hence, vortex
pairs moving with diﬀerent speeds tend to behave like individual particles, decoupling af-
ter a large time. This is what makes the study of vortex scattering interesting in this
context. Let us illustrate the point of view we want to pursue with the example of the
Korteweg-deVries equation. Nonlinear scattering for the KdV is well-understood, as solu-
tions of KdV with smooth, compactly supported initial data are expected to resolve into
a scattering state composed of an N-soliton plus a slowly decaying dispersive tail. This
fact was ﬁrst formulated as a conjecture by P. Lax in [15] and broadly explored through
the method of inverse scattering since then. The conclusion of Theorem 1.1 may be re-
garded as a weak, or averaged form of Lax’s conjecture for vortex pair dynamics. Note
that steady vortex pairs correspond to classical solitons in this analogy, but no existence
for the multibump solutions that would be associated to the classical N-solitons has been
rigorously established.

Let us call shape space the space of smooth compactly supported vorticity conﬁgura-
tions, identifying conﬁgurations which are related through horizontal translations. Steady
vortex pairs correspond to stationary shapes with respect to Euler dynamics. There are so-
lutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations that describe periodic loops
in shape space. Two examples of this behavior are: 1) a pair of like-signed point vortices
on a half plane, which orbit one another periodically as they translate horizontally, called
leapfrogging pairs, and 2) Deem and Zabusky’s translational V -states, which are vortex
patches with discrete symmetry, see [5]. From the point of view of scattering such solutions
represent another kind of asymptotic state or, in other words, another kind of particle. Fur-
thermore, one may well imagine solutions with quasiperiodic or chaotic behavior in shape
space. Although there is no example of either case in the literature, the passive tracer
dynamics of the leapfrogging pair is known to be chaotic, see [28]. Possible chaotic shapes
represent an interesting illustration of Theorem 1.1, as both the hypothesis of weak con-
vergence and the conclusion are clearly related to the ergodicity of shape dynamics and
the self-averaging of the velocity of the center of vorticity of such generalized vortex pairs.
Finally, we must mention the work of Overman and Zabusky [27], where they do numerical
experiments on the short term scattering of pairs of translational V -states, the ﬁrst (and
only) study to date on the interaction of coaxial vortex pairs, which is the main point of
the present work.

The remainder of this article is divided into two large sections. The ﬁrst one contains
a discussion of conﬁnement of vorticity in half plane ﬂow, including two new results, hor-
izontal conﬁnement on the left and bounds on the distance to the boundary. The second

4

one contains the discussion leading to our main result, together with its proof. After this
second section we include a brief section with conclusions and an Appendix containing a
simple illustration of half-plane vortex dynamics.

2. Confinement of vorticity
2.1. Preliminary results. Let us begin by ﬁxing basic notation. We denote by H the
horizontal half-plane given by H = {x ∈ R2; x2 > 0}. Reﬂection with respect to x2 = 0 will
be denoted by x = (x1, x2) 7→ x = (x1, −x2). If z = (z1, z2) then its perpendicular vector
c(H) to denote the Lebesgue space of p-th power integrable
is z⊥ = (−z2, z1). We use Lp
functions, p ≥ 1, with compact support in H. The dual of Lp is Lp′
, with the conjugate
exponent given by p′ = p/(p − 1). The space of bounded Radon measures is denoted by
BM and the Dirac delta at the origin is δ0.

Consider the initial-boundary value problem for the incompressible 2D Euler equations
in the half-plane (1.1) with initial vorticity ω0.
If ω0 is bounded then (1.1) is globally
well-posed since it is equivalent, through the method of images, to an initial-value problem
in the full-plane, with bounded, compactly supported initial vorticity (shown to be well-
posed by Yudovich in [37]). The method of images consists of the observation that the Euler
equations are covariant with respect to mirror-symmetry. Thus an initial vorticity which
is odd with respect to reﬂection about the horizontal axis will remain so, and give rise to
ﬂow under which the half-plane is invariant. Conversely, the odd extension, with respect
to x2 = 0, of vorticity in half-plane ﬂow gives rise to full-plane ﬂow. This observation
is especially useful in order to deduce the Biot-Savart law for half-plane ﬂow, to recover
velocity from vorticity.

Let us ﬁx an initial vorticity ω0. We will assume throughout this article that ω0 is a given
c(H), 2 < p < ∞, then there exists
nonnegative function in Lp
a weak solution u, ω of (1.1) associated with this initial vorticity (see [17]). Furthermore,
ω(t, ·) ≥ 0, t ≥ 0, and the L1 and Lp-norms of ω(t, ·) are bounded by the L1 and Lp-norms,
respectively, of the initial vorticity. Using the method of images we can write the velocity
u in terms of vorticity ω as:

c(H) for some p > 2. If ω0 ∈ Lp

and K2(x, y) =

2(x1 − y1)x2y2
π|x − y|2|x − y|2 .

5

It is easy to see that

(2.4)

|K(x, y)| ≤

π|x − y|

,

from which we can deduce the fact that, if p > 2, then an L1 ∩ Lp-vorticity ω gives rise to
an L∞-velocity u with the estimate:

kukL∞(H) ≤ Ckωkp′/2

Lp(H)kωk1−p′/2
L1(H) .

One interesting fact is that this estimate can be localized. From a technical point of view,
this fact is the heart of the arguments presented in this work. To be more precise we will
be using the following lemma, whose proof can be found in [11]:
Lemma 2.1. Let a ∈ (0, 2), S ⊂ R2 and let h : S → R, h ≥ 0, be a function belonging to
L1(S) ∩ Lp(S), p > 2
2−a . Then there exists a constant D = Da,p > 0 such that the following
estimate holds:

h(y)

|x − y|a dy ≤ Da,pkhkap′/2

Lp(S)khk1−ap′/2

L1(S)

,

ZS

∀x ∈ R2.

Remark 2.1. To illustrate our use of this Lemma note that, when the function h is the
vorticity and a = 1 this estimate implies that the portion of velocity due to vorticity in a
region S will be small if the mass of vorticity in that region is small.

2.2. One-sided horizontal conﬁnement of vorticity. Iftimie showed in [11] that the
horizontal component of the center of mass in half-plane ﬂow travels with speed bounded
below by a positive constant. This excludes any possible sublinear-in-time horizontal con-
ﬁnement, at least in the direction x1 > 0. On the other hand, half-plane ﬂows with
nonnegative vorticity have a tendency to move to the right, resisting left “back ﬂow”. The
purpose of this section is to make this statement more precise. Our main result in this
section is:
c(H), p > 2, ω0 ≥ 0. Let u and ω be solutions of (1.1) with
Theorem 2.1. Let ω0 ∈ Lp
initial vorticity ω0. Then there exists a positive constant D depending solely on the initial
vorticity such that

supp ω(t, ·) ⊂ {x ∈ H ; x1 ≥ −D(t log t)

1

2 }

for all t > 2.

Before we give the proof of Theorem 2.1 we need a technical lemma, in which we obtain
an estimate on the mass of vorticity in the “back ﬂow” region; we see that it is exponentially
small.
Lemma 2.2. Given k ∈ N, there exist positive constants D1 and D2, depending only on
the initial vorticity and on k, such that

We will ﬁnish this section with the proof of the horizontal conﬁnement to the left.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Let D3 and D4 be as in Proposition 2.1. If need be increase the val-
ues of D3 and D4 to show that any trajectory which reaches the region {x1 ≤ −D4(t log t)

does not have enough horizontal velocity to go past the line x1 = −2D4(t log t)
2 . This
2 } (with D4 depending
proves that every trajectory lies in the region {x1 ≥ −2D4(t log t)
on the initial position of the trajectory); in particular, the support of the evolved vorticity
stays in that region.

2.3. Proximity to the boundary. For smooth ﬂows it is easy to see that, if the support
of the initial vorticity lies in the interior of the half-plane, then the support never reaches
the boundary due to uniqueness of solutions of ODEs. Even if the ﬂow is not smooth
this remains accurate when understood in the context of the R. DiPerna and P.-L. Lions’
theory of ODEs in Sobolev spaces [7]. However, we are left with no information on how far
a particle path must remain from the boundary. The purpose of this section is to examine
this issue. We will show that particle paths must stay at least as far as e−C1eC2t away
from the boundary, for some positive constants C1, C2. This result is interesting from the
point of view of conﬁnement, but it will not be used for the development of large time
asymptotics. A similar concern was addressed by N. Depauw in his work on vortex patches
in a bounded domain, see [6].

We will use throughout this section the notation

supp ω(t, ·) ⊂ {x ∈ H ; x2 ≥ e−D1eD1t

}

for all times t ≥ 0.

Proof of Theorem 2.2. We will prove that for all x ∈ H, one has that

for some constant D > 0 depending only on the initial vorticity. Assuming that this is

Let us turn to the proof of (2.8). Fix x ∈ H and start by noting that, by the Biot-Savart

law (2.1) and (2.3),

u2(t, x) =

2x2
π Z

(x1 − y1)y2

|x − y|2|x − y|2 ω(t, y) dy ≡

2x2
π Z

L1(x, y) ω(t, y) dy.

We begin by observing that |x1 − y1| ≤ |x − y| and, since x2, y2 > 0, |y2| ≤ |x2 + y2| ≤

|x − y|, so that

|L1(x, y)| ≤

1
|x − y||x − y|

.

x2 + y2 ≥

|x2 − y2| + x2
2

.

It can be easily checked that

Using this estimate we ﬁnd:

|x − y| ≥

(|x1 − y1| + |x2 + y2|) ≥

1
2

|x1 − y1| + |x2 − y2| + x2
4

≥

|x − y| + x2
4

.

Finally, we obtain the following estimate for L1:

(2.9)

ticles far from x:

|L1(x, y)| ≤

|x − y|(|x − y| + x2)

.

In order to estimate u2(t, x) we ﬁrst estimate the contribution of vorticity-bearing par-

(2.10)

|L1(x, y)| ω(t, y) dy ≤ 4

ω(t, y) dy ≤ 4kω0kL1.

From (2.9) and (2.10) we deduce that

ω(t, y) dy

Z{|x−y|≤1}

for some constant C > 0. Changing to polar coordinates and estimating ω(t, ·) by the
L∞-norm of ω0, it follows that

for some constant C. Relation (2.8) now follows.

Remark 2.3. We call attention to the fact that this result holds without any condition on
the sign of vorticity.

2.4. Vertical conﬁnement. Another piece of information on conﬁnement of vorticity for
half-plane ﬂows stems from the conservation of the second component of the center of
vorticity. Such a result was obtained by Iftimie in [11] (see Theorem 3 and also Remark 3
of [11]). The resulting estimate will be used in what follows, so that we include its precise
statement here for the sake of completeness.

Theorem 2.3 ([11]). If the initial vorticity ω0 belongs to Lp
a constant D > 0, depending solely on ω0 and p, such that

c(H), p > 2, then there exists

supp ω(t, ·) ⊂ {x ∈ H ; x2 ≤ D(t log t)

1

3 }

for all t > 2, where ω(t, ·) is a weak solution of (1.1) having initial vorticity ω0.

The complete proof can be found in [11].

3. Asymptotic behavior of nonnegative vorticity in the half-plane

We now turn to our main concern in this paper, the rigorous study of the asymptotic
behavior of ﬂows with nonnegative vorticity in the half-plane. We divide this section in
three subsections. In the ﬁrst one we introduce the self-similar rescaling of the ﬂow which
encodes the scattering information we wish to study, we write an evolution equation for
the rescaled vorticity and we interpret the vortex conﬁnement information obtained in the
previous section in terms of the new scaling. The second subsection is the technical heart of
this article, where we study the behavior of the nonlinearity in the equations with respect
to the self-similar scaling. Finally, in the third subsection we use the information obtained
to prove our main result.

3.1. Rescaled vorticity and asymptotic densities. One key feature of vortex dynam-
ics in a half-plane is nonlinear wave propagation. In order to examine wave propagation it
is natural to focus on a self-similar rescaling of physical space, as has been performed by
Chen and Frid in the context of systems of conservation laws, see [3]. Let us ﬁx, through-
c(H), p > 2, and ω = ω(t, ·), u = u(t, ·),
out this section, a nonnegative function ω0 ∈ Lp
solutions of (1.1) with initial vorticity ω0. Set
ω(t, y) = t2ω(t, ty) and

u(t, y) = tu(t, ty),

(3.1)

the rescaled vorticity and velocity, respectively. The scaling above respects the elliptic
system relating velocity and vorticity so that we still have

Let M = kukL∞(R+×H). Then the conﬁnement estimates for vorticity in the half-plane,
in particular Theorems 2.1 and 2.3 and the fact that the vorticity ω is transported by the
velocity u, imply that there exists a constant C > 0 such that:

ω must have the
time. The conﬁnement estimate (3.3) implies that any weak-∗ limit of
structure µ ⊗ δ0(x2), with the support of µ contained in the interval [0, M].
e

It is in the nature of the self-similar rescaling (3.1) that much of the scattering behavior
of the ﬂow is encoded in the measure µ. This measure is the main subject of the remainder
of this article, and, as such, deserves an appropriate name.

e

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let µ ∈ BM([0, M]) be a nonnegative measure such that there exists a
sequence of times tk → ∞ for which

ω(tk, ·) ⇀ µ ⊗ δ0 in the weak-∗ topology of bounded measures, as tk → ∞.

Then we call µ an asymptotic velocity density associated to ω0.

e

It can be readily checked that, if ω(t, x) = ω0(x1 − σt, x2), then there exists a unique
asymptotic velocity density µ, which is a Dirac delta at position (σ, 0) with mass given by
the integral of ω0. For a general ﬂow an asymptotic velocity density encodes information
on typical velocities with which diﬀerent portions of vorticity are traveling.

3.2. The key estimate. Our purpose in this article is to understand the structure of the
ω
asymptotic velocity densities. To do so we make use of the evolution equation (3.4) for
and we examine the behavior for large time of each of its terms. The main diﬃculty in

doing so is understanding the behavior of the nonlinear term div (

We begin with two general measure-theoretical lemmas which will be needed in what
follows. These are standard exercises in real analysis and we include the proofs only for
the sake of completeness. Recall that a measure is called continuous if it attaches zero
mass to points.

Lemma 3.1. Let µ be a ﬁnite and compactly supported nonnegative measure on R. Then
µ is the sum of a nonnegative continuous measure ν and a countable sum of positive Dirac
measures (the discrete part of µ). Moreover, for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that,
if I is an interval of length less than δ, then ν(I) ≤ ε.

Proof. Let A = {x ; µ({x}) 6= 0}. Then A is countable; indeed, A =
n An and each
An = {x ; µ({x}) ≥ 1/n} must be ﬁnite because µ is ﬁnite. Hence we may write A =
{x1, x2, . . . } and mj = µ({xj}). Of course, ν = µ −
j mjδxj is a continuous, nonnegative
measure.

S

P

Let J be a compact interval containing the support of µ. For each x ∈ J, it follows
that, since ν({x}) = 0, there exists δx > 0 such that ν([x − δx, x + δx]) ≤ ε/2. Let
Jx = [x − δx, x + δx]. Then J ⊂
x∈J Jx so that, using the fact that J is compact, we can
extract a ﬁnite subcover, J ⊂ Jx1 ∪ · · · ∪ Jxn. The interval J is now divided in a ﬁnite
number of disjoint intervals (not necessarily Jx1, Jx2, . . . , Jxn), each having ν–measure less
than ε/2. It is then suﬃcient to choose δ equal to one half of the minimum length of these
intervals. For that choice of δ, it is clear that an interval of length δ cannot intersect more
than two of the disjoint intervals constructed above so that its ν–measure will be less than
ε.

S

Lemma 3.2. Let γn be a sequence of nonnegative Radon measures on H, converging weakly
to some measure γ, and having the supports uniformly bounded in the vertical direction.
Then, for every compact interval [a, b] one has that

lim sup
n→∞

γn([a, b] × R+) ≤ γ([a, b] × R+).

Proof. Fix ε > 0. Since

there exists δ > 0 such that

γ([a, b] × R+) = lim
δ→0

γ([a − δ, b + δ] × R+),

γ([a − δ, b + δ] × R+) < γ([a, b] × R+) + ε.

Let ϕ be a continuous function supported in (a − δ, b + δ) and such that 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 1
,
(cid:11)

[a,b]= 1. According to the hypothesis, we have that

From the hypothesis on the test function ϕ it follows that, for all n ≥ N,

γn([a, b] × R+) ≤

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

γ(y), ϕ(y1)
≤ γ([a − δ, b + δ] × R+) + ε ≤ γ([a, b] × R+) + 2ε.
(cid:11)
(cid:10)

+ε

We deduce that

lim sup
n→∞

γn([a, b] × R+) ≤ γ([a, b] × R+) + 2ε.

The desired conclusion follows by letting ε → 0.

Let us now return to the study of the asymptotic behavior of vorticity. Let ω0 ≥ 0 be a
ﬁxed function in Lp
ω deﬁned
in (3.1). Let µ be an asymptotic velocity density associated to ω0. Then µ is a nonnegative
measure in BM([0, M]), with M = kukL∞, and by Lemma 3.1, µ can be written as

c(H), for some p > 2, and let u, ω be solutions of (1.1), with

u,

µ = ν +

where ν is the continuous part of µ and αi ∈ [0, M]. As ω0 ≥ 0 it follows that mi ≥ 0

and, as µ is a bounded measure,
i=1 mi < ∞. Furthermore we can assume without loss
of generality that αi 6= αj in the decomposition (3.6).

P
Let {tk} be a sequence of times approaching inﬁnity such that

ω(tk, ·) ⇀ µ ⊗ δ0(x2),
as k → ∞, weak-∗ in BM(H). The following proposition is what we refer to as the key
estimate in the title of this subsection.
Proposition 3.1. Let ψ ∈ C 0(R). Then there exists a constant D > 0, depending only on
p, such that the following estimate holds:

Remark 3.1. It will be clear from the proof that the constant D can be chosen as D =

Before giving the proof of Proposition 3.1, let us motivate the statement with the follow-
ing example. Consider a steady vortex pair with vorticity given by ω(t, x) = ω0(x1 −σt, x2)
and velocity u(t, x) = u0(x1 − σt, x2). Then it is easy to see that the rescaled nonlinear

term

expect the right-hand side of (3.7) to be
the steady vortex pair, it can be easily checked that

Proof. Eventually changing the order in the summation of the Diracs, we can assume that
i = 1. Furthermore, the conclusion is trivial if α1 = 0, so we can assume that α1 > 0 as
well. Let ε > 0 be ﬁxed. There exists δ ∈ (0, α1) such that the following inequality holds:

have that mi ≤ ε.

Let ψ ∈ C 0(R) be a nonnegative function supported in (α1 − δ, α1 + δ) ⊂ R+ which
attains its maximum at α1. By (3.23) and using the nonnegativity of µ and y1ψ(y1) we

i→∞−−−→ 0. According to the conclusion of Lemma 3.4 this

immediately implies that αi

i→∞−−−→ 0.

Next, observe that Lemma 3.5 implies that the continuous part ν vanishes.

Indeed,
supp ν ⊂ [0, ∞) since supp µ ⊂ [0, M]. If α > 0, as α is not an accumulation point of the
set {α1, α2, . . . }, there exists δ ∈ (0, α) such that {α1, α2, . . . } ∩
= ∅.
According to Lemma 3.5, the measure µ vanishes in (α − δ, α) and (α, α + δ), so the same
is true for ν. Since ν is continuous we deduce that ν must vanish in (α − δ, α + δ). We
proved that ν vanishes in the neighborhood of each point of (0, ∞). This implies that ν
vanishes on (0, ∞). Therefore, ν vanishes on R \ {0} and is continuous. We conclude that
ν = 0.

4. Extensions and Conclusions

We begin this section with some comments regarding the results obtained here.
(a) The only instance of use of the energy estimate in this work is the observation that,
for any asymptotic velocity density µ we have
> C > 0, which appears when
proving the last part of Theorem 3.1. The constant C depends on the kinetic energy
(cid:11)
of the initial data, as was derived in [11]. It would be interesting to know whether
kinetic energy partitions itself in a way that is consistent with the partitioning of
vorticity, but we were not able to prove that, at least using only the hypothesis of
uniqueness of the asymptotic velocity density.

µ, x1
(cid:10)

(b) We only used the hypothesis of uniqueness of the asymptotic velocity density when
we derived (3.23). The estimate on the behavior of the nonlinear term given in
Proposition 3.1 always holds, which raises the possibility of it being exploited further.
(c) The hypothesis that the initial vorticity be p-integrable, with p > 2 is used to ensure
that the velocity is globally bounded. In principle, with vorticity in Lp, p ≤ 2, we
loose control over the loss of vorticity to inﬁnity, and Lemma 2.1 is no longer true. In
fact, we do not even know the correct scaling to analyze in this case.

(d) We could have proved a result for initial vorticities without distinguished sign, which
would have our main theorem here as a special case. The distinguished sign hypothesis

24

was used mainly because it allows us to place the hypothesis of uniqueness of the
ω|, where the authors feel it would be much less
asymptotic limit on
plausible.

ω, instead of on |

e

We would like to add a remark on the choice of the scaling x = ty.

If the scaling
x1 ≡ ty1 in the horizontal direction is motivated by the fact that the ﬁrst component
of the center of vorticity behaves exactly like O(t), the scaling x2 ≡ ty2 is not justiﬁed
because the second component of the center of vorticity is constant.
Ideally we should
not make any rescaling in the vertical direction but then we would have to assume that
tω(tx1, x2) converges weakly, which we found excessive because of the oscillations that
may appear in the vertical direction. We could also consider an intermediate scaling of
the form x2 ≡ f (t)y2 where f (t) → ∞ as t → ∞. This last problem is in fact equivalent
If f is such a function, then the weak limits of
to the one we consider in this paper.
ωf (t, y) = tf (t)ω
are independent of f . Indeed, let νf be the weak limit of
ωf (t, y) as t → ∞ and choose a test function h ∈ C ∞

simplicity. This means that we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions in horizontal
direction but not in the vertical one.

(cid:1)

We would like to comment on a few problems that arise naturally from the work presented
here. The ﬁrst is to remove the hypothesis of uniqueness of the asymptotic velocity proﬁle,
perhaps with weaker conclusions. Also, we can try to extend this line of reasoning to other
ﬂuid dynamical situations with similar geometry, such as ﬂow on an inﬁnite ﬂat channel,
axisymmetric ﬂow (smoke ring dynamics), and water wave problems. We may also ask the
same questions with respect to full two-dimensional scattering, allowing for vortex pairs
moving oﬀ to inﬁnity in diﬀerent directions. Finally, one might try to examine the issue
of actually proving the uniqueness of asymptotic velocity densities in special cases, for
example, for point vortex dynamics. We have actually looked at the case of three point
vortices on the half-plane, so far without success.

Appendix. Separation of two vortices above a flat wall

Steady vortex pairs provide smooth examples of vorticities for which the corresponding
asymptotic velocity densities consist of a single Dirac mass. We would like to give such an

25

(A.2)

(A.3)

and

(A.4)

(A.5)

example with at least two diﬀerent Dirac masses in the asymptotic velocity density. As we
pointed out in the introduction, the existence of multibump solutions in this situation is
an interesting open problem, but we can oﬀer a discrete example in order to illustrate this
issue. In this section we will give a suﬃcient condition for linear separation of two vortices
above a ﬂat wall which will in turn give us an example of unique asymptotic velocity
density concentrating at two distinct Dirac masses.

Let z1 = (x1, y1) and z2 = (x2, y2) be two vortices above the wall {y = 0} of positive
masses m1, resp. m2. For notational convenience we will assume that we start at time
t = 1 instead of t = 0. Let L be deﬁned by

(A.1)

L = m1y1 + m2y2,

a quantity which is conserved by the motion of the vortices. We will prove the following
proposition.

Proposition A.1. Suppose there exists a positive constant M such that the following re-
lations hold true:

x2(1) − x1(1) > M,
L2

L > m2y2(1) +

Then, the two vortices z1 and z2 linearly separate. More precisely,

(cid:1)

for all times t ≥ 1.

x2(t) − x1(t) > Mt

Remark A.1. Let m1, m2 and L be some ﬁxed arbitrary positive constants. Then we can
always ﬁnd x1(1), y1(1), x2(1), y2(1) and M such that relations (A.1), (A.2), (A.3) and
(A.4) are satisﬁed. Indeed, we ﬁrst choose x1(1) and x2(1) such that (A.2) holds. We next
note that (A.3) and (A.4) are satisﬁed for large enough M and small enough y2(1). For
example, if y2(1) = 0, then (A.4) has a left-hand side of order M 3 so it is veriﬁed for M
large enough; and since, for that choice of M, it is satisﬁed for y2(1) = 0, it will be satisﬁed
for small enough y2(1), too. Once y2(1) and M are chosen, it remains to choose y1(1) such
that (A.1) is satisﬁed for t = 1.

Proof of Proposition A.1. It is suﬃcient to prove that, as long as (A.5) holds, then

(A.6)

(x2 − x1)′(t) ≥ M.

26

Indeed, the result then follows by a contradiction argument:
x2(T ) − x1(T ) = MT , then necessarily T > 1 and

if T is the ﬁrst time when

MT = (x2 − x1)(T ) = x2(1) − x1(1) +

(x2 − x1)′ > M + M(T − 1) = MT

T

Z

which is a contradiction.

We will therefore assume in the following that (A.5) holds and try to prove (A.6).

It follows from the method of images that the motion of these vortices can be computed

from the full plane ﬂow due to these two vortices together with their images:

z3 = z1 = (x1, −y1)

and

z4 = z2 = (x2, −y2)

with masses m3 = −m1, resp. m4 = −m2. Therefore, the equations of motion are given
by:

2πz′

(z1 − z2)⊥

(z1 − z3)⊥

|z1 − z2|2 (y1 + y2, x2 − x1).

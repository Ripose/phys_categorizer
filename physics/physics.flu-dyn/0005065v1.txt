Abstract

The proﬁles of a spreading wetting ﬁlm are computed taking into account

intermolecular forces and introducing a kinetic slip condition at a molecular

cut-oﬀ distance. This eliminates the stress singularity, so that both “true”

and “visible” contact angles are deﬁned unequivocally. The “true” contact

angle at the cut-oﬀ distance depends on the slip length as well as on the edge

propagation speed, but not on gravity or asymptotic inclination angle. These

macroscopic factors inﬂuence, however, the “visible” contact angle observed

in the interval where the actual ﬁlm proﬁle departs from the intermediate

asymptotic curve.

I. INTRODUCTION

The two basic unsolved problems in the theory of a moving three-phase contact line

are deﬁning the contact angle and resolving the infamous viscous stress singularity. Dif-

ferent approaches to both problems, neither of them satisfactory, have been reviewed by

Shikhmurzaev [1]. Even under equilibrium conditions, the structure of the three-phase re-

gion cannot be understood without taking into account intermolecular interactions between

the ﬂuid and the solid support [2–4]. It becomes apparent that motion of a contact line is an

1

intrinsically mesoscopic problem, and the dynamical theory should blend factors contributed

by hydrodynamics and physical kinetics.

The “standard” equilibrium contact angle θe is deﬁned by the Young–Laplace formula

σv − σl = σ cos θe.

(1)

which involves surface tension σ of an interface between two semi-inﬁnite ﬂuid phases (in the

simplest case, a one-component liquid and its vapor) and (non-measurable) surface tensions

between the solid support and either ﬂuid, σl and σv. Since, by deﬁnition, the standard

surface tension refers to a boundary between semi-inﬁnite phases, the surface properties

should be modiﬁed when the three-phase region falls within the range of intermolecular

forces, and therefore the classical formula is likely to fail in a close vicinity of the contact

line. This region is too small to be detected by available measurement techniques, but

modiﬁcation of interfacial properties is often revealed by the formation of a precursor ﬁlm.

Thus, even under equilibrium conditions the contact angle, generally, varies with the distance

from the contact line and cannot be deﬁned unequivocally.

In a dynamical situation, such as wetting, spreading or draw-down of a meniscus, the

interfacial curvature, and hence, the change of the contact angle, are further inﬂuenced by

the viscous stress. A properly deﬁned contact angle ﬁxes the boundary condition at the edge

of an advancing or receding ﬁlm and is therefore a necessary ingredient for computation of

macroscopic ﬂows, inﬂuenced also by external forces, such as gravity, and by changes in tem-

perature and chemical composition through buoyancy and Marangoni eﬀect. Macroscopic

measurements yield the so-called “visible” contact angle, diﬀering from both the “standard”

value in Eq. (1) and a hypothetical “true” (microscopic) value. Both “true” and visible

contact angles should depend on the ﬂow velocity and are subject to hysteresis.

One should be warned that the very notion of a “true” interfacial angle is precarious, since

it extrapolates the concept of a sharp interface of a continuous theory to molecular distances.

This notion is eliminated altogether in molecular simulations [5,6] and in diﬀuse interface

theories [7–10]. In continuum theories incorporating intermolecular forces the “true” contact

2

angle can be deﬁned at most at the molecular cut-oﬀ distance d. This is sometimes forgotten

when hydrodynamic theory leads to the appearance of unphysically narrow boundary layers.

Bearing in mind limitations of continuum mechanics extended to molecular scales, we

attempt in this communication to combine the standard hydrodynamic theory with a simple

kinetic description of sliding motion in the ﬁrst molecular layer adjacent to the solid support.

The thickness of the sliding layer is identiﬁed with the cut-oﬀ length in the van der Waals

interaction potential; thus, the theory is expected to operate at about the same crude level

as the classroom derivation of the van der Waals equation of state [11].

The paper is organized as follows. We start in Section II with a detailed discussion of

the slip condition. Basic equations in lubrication approximation are formulated in Section

III. Intermediate asymptotics of the solutions at relatively short macroscopic distances from

the contact line, where gravity still does not come into play, are discussed in Section IV.

Solutions describing the form of a stationary meniscus on a moving inclined plane are given

in Section V.

II. SLIP CONDITION

With any ﬁnite contact angle given as a boundary condition, a moving contact line still

cannot be described within the framework of conventional hydrodynamics, since the classical

no-slip condition on a solid substrate generates a multivalued velocity and, hence, an inﬁnite

stress in the vicinity of a contact line, leading formally to an inﬁnite drag force [12,13].

The most common way to eliminate the viscous stress singularity is to impose a phe-

nomenological slip condition. Presence of slip at a microscopic scale comparable with inter-

molecular distances is an established fact in Maxwell’s [14] kinetic theory of gases; for dense

ﬂuids it is a feasible hypothesis supported by molecular dynamics simulations [5,6]. The two

alternatives are slip conditions of “hydrodynamic” and “kinetic” type.

The version of the slip condition most commonly used in ﬂuid-mechanical theory is a

linear relation between the velocity component along the solid surface us and the shear stress

3

[15,16]. The proportionality constant contains a phenomenological parameter – slip length

– characterizing intermolecular interaction between the ﬂuid and the solid; in liquids this

length should be small, so that the eﬀect of sliding becomes signiﬁcant only in the vicinity of

a moving contact line where stresses are very large. This condition has been widely used for

modeling macroscopic ﬂows involving the contact line motion [17–21]. It does not eliminate

the stress singularity but only makes it integrable, thus leaving a logarithmic (integrable)

singularity of the interfacial curvature. This leads formally to a breakdown of the commonly

used lubrication approximation in the vicinity of a contact line that can be remedied only

by further ad hoc assumptions, making the slip length dependent on the distance from the

contact line [18,21].

This drawback may be mere technical, but a more serious disadvantage of hydrodynamic

slip theories lies in their inherent inability to predict the dynamic contact angle. Thus, the

two basic problems become disentangled, and, in addition to a phenomenological slip coeﬃ-

cient, empirical relationships between the velocity and contact angle have to be introduced

in model computations.

Another version of the slip condition, rooted in physical kinetics [22–25], deﬁnes the slip

velocity through the gradient of thermodynamic potential w along the solid surface:

us = −

D
nkT ∇w,

(2)

where D is surface diﬀusivity, n is particle number density, k is Boltzmann constant, T

is temperature, and ∇ is two-dimensional gradient operator along the solid surface. The
condition (2) follows rather naturally from considering activated diﬀusion in the ﬁrst molec-

ular layer adjacent to the solid. In contrast to the hydrodynamic slip condition, the kinetic

condition (2) can be used to deﬁne the “true” dynamic contact angle at the contact line in

a unique way, as we shall see below.

Extrapolating the continuous description of ﬂuid motion to a molecular scale might be

conceptually diﬃcult but unavoidable as far as interfacial dynamics is concerned. Long-

range intermolecular interactions, such as London–van der Waals forces, still operate on a

4

mesoscopic scale where continuous theory is justiﬁed, but they should be bounded by an inner

cut-oﬀ d of atomic dimensions. Thus, distinguishing the ﬁrst molecular layer from the bulk

ﬂuid becomes necessary even in equilibrium theory. In dynamic theory, the motion in the

ﬁrst molecular layer can be described by Eq. (2), whereas the bulk ﬂuid obeys hydrodynamic

equations supplemented by the action of intermolecular forces. Equation (2) serves then as

the boundary condition at the solid surface. Moreover, at the contact line, where the bulk

ﬂuid layer either terminates altogether or gives way to a monomolecular precursor ﬁlm, the

same slip condition deﬁnes the slip component of the ﬂow pattern, and Eq. (2) can be used

to estimate the “true” contact angle if it is assumed that the motion is pure slip at the

contact line.

Miller and Ruckenstein [26] used the dependence of the disjoining pressure generated

by London–van der Waals forces in a wedge to compute the “true” equilibrium contact

angle. This result has been used by Hocking [27] to set the boundary condition at the

contact line in the hydrodynamic theory, and by Ruckenstein and Dunn [23] to compute

the slip velocity. Order-of-magnitude estimates show, however, that at small inclination

angles necessary to justify the lubrication approximation used in hydrodynamic theory the

correction to disjoining pressure due to surface inclination is extremely small, and the “true”

angle may be formally attained only at distances far below atomic dimensions. At higher

inclination angles, the computation fails technically, since the interface must be curved, and

its form should be determined by a very complicated integro-diﬀerential equation involving

intermolecular interactions as well as viscous stress and surface tension.

We propose to use the kinetic slip condition in the another way, to obtain a relation

between the slip velocity and the thermodynamic potential at the contact line by considering

the motion at the point where the ﬁlm thins down to the minimal thickness h = d. This

is the advancing edge of a wetting ﬁlm, or a retreating edge of a dewetting ﬁlm, dividing it

from the dry solid surface. If the ﬂuid is not volatile, the motion at this point should be

pure slip, while standard caterpillar motion is retained at observable macroscopic distances.

In the case of an advancing wetting ﬁlm, we expect that the leading edge is followed by a

5

thin precursor ﬁlm where surface tension is negligible and the action of intermolecular forces

driving the advancing ﬁlm is balanced by viscous dissipation. The boundary condition at

the leading edge will be then the same Eq. (2) with us replaced by the edge propagation

speed U and ∇w computed at h = d with surface tension neglected.

Another possibility might be to assume that the slip motion at the edge is driven by the

potential drop over the molecular cut-oﬀ distance d. This yields, by analogy with Eq. (2),

the boundary condition at the contact line

U = −

D
nkT

w(d)

d

,

(3)

where w(d) is the thermodynamic potential of the ﬁlm of the minimal thickness; the potential

at the dry surface is taken as zero. After w(d) is computed as in the following Section, Eq. (3)

turns into a condition relating the curvature at the contact line with the propagation speed.

We shall see that this condition leads in fact to non-physical results at small propagation

velocities. At large velocities, computations using the alternative boundary conditions yield

practically the same results (see Section IV).

III. BASIC EQUATIONS AND SCALING

We shall use the lubrication approximation, which is formally obtained by scaling the

two-dimensional gradient operator along the solid surface ∇ ∝ ǫ, ǫ ≪ 1. Respectively, time
is scaled as ∂t ∝ ǫ2, the velocity in the direction parallel to the solid support as u ∝ ǫ and
transverse velocity as v ∝ ǫ2. This implies that the thermodynamic potential w is constant
across the layer. The gradient of w in the direction parallel to the solid support serves as

the forcing term in the Stokes equation. The velocity proﬁle u(z) across the ﬁlm veriﬁes

∇w = ηuzz, uz(h) = 0, u(d) = us,

(4)

where η is the dynamic viscosity. We use here the no-stress boundary condition on the

free surface z = h, but replace the usual no-slip boundary condition on the solid support

6

u(0) = 0 by the slip condition at the molecular cut-oﬀ distance d with us given by Eq. (2).

The solution in the bulk layer d < z < h is

u = −η−1hλ2 + h(z − d) − 1
where λ =qDη/nkT is the eﬀective slip length.

2(z2 − d2)i∇w,

(5)

The general balance equation for the ﬁlm thickness h, obtained from the kinematic

condition on the free surface, can be presented as a generalized Cahn–Hilliard equation,

where the two-dimensional ﬂux j in the plane aligned with the solid support is proportional

to the two-dimensional gradient of the potential w:

ht + ∇ · j = 0,

j = −η−1Q(h)∇w.

(6)

The eﬀective mobility η−1Q(h) is obtained by integrating Eq. (5) across the layer. Including

also the constant slip velocity u = −λ2η−1∇w in the slip layer 0 < z < d, we have

Q(h) =hλ2h + 1

3(h − d)3i .

(7)

Since both λ and d are measurable on the molecular scale (see the estimates in the end

of this Section), this expression does not diﬀer in a macroscopically thick layer from the

standard shallow water mobility Q0 = 1

3h3, and the correction becomes signiﬁcant only in

the immediate vicinity of the contact line.

The potential w is computed at the free surface z = h. Taking into account surface

tension, gravity, and van der Waals force, it is expressed as

w = −σǫ2∇2h + gρ(h − αx) −

A
6πh3 ,

(8)

where A is the Hamaker constant, g is acceleration of gravity, ρ is density, σ is surface

tension, and ǫα is the inclination angle of the solid surface along the x axis. The dummy

small parameter ǫ is the ratio of characteristic scales across and along the layer; the relative

scaling of diﬀerent terms in Eq. (8) is formally consistent when σ = O(ǫ−2). Further on, we

suppress the dependence on the second coordinate in the plane, replacing the Laplacian by

d2/dx2.

7

In the following, we shall consider the ﬁlm with a contact line steadily advancing along

the x axis in the negative direction with the speed U. Then Eq. (6) can be rewritten in the

comoving frame, thus replacing ht by Uhx, and integrated once. Making use of the condition

of zero ﬂux through the contact line to removing the integration constant yields

− ηUh + Q(h)w′(x) = 0.

(9)

This equation can be further transformed using h as the independent variable and y(h) = h2
x

as the dependent variable. We rewrite the transformed equation introducing the capillary
number Ca = |U|η/σǫ2, van der Waals length a = ǫ−1(|A|/6πσ)1/2, and gravity length
b = ǫ(σ/gρ)1/2:

(10)

The boundary condition following from (2) and balancing intermolecular forces and viscous

dissipation at h = d takes the form

y(d) =(cid:16)d4Ca/3λ2a2(cid:17)2

.

(11)

The alternative boundary condition (3), set at h = d, is rewritten, using Eq. (8) and ne-

glecting the gravity term, as

(12)

Equation (10) contains three microscopic scales d, a, λ and a macroscopic gravity length

b. The natural choice for d is the nominal molecular diameter, identiﬁed with the cut-oﬀ

distance in the van der Waals theory. The standard value [3] is 0.165nm. The slip length

is likely to be of the same order of magnitude. The approximate relation between viscosity

η and self-diﬀusivity Dm in a liquid [28] yields Dmη ≈ 102kT /3πd. The surface diﬀusivity
should be somewhat lower than the diﬀusivity in the bulk liquid, and with D/Dm ≈ 0.1 we
have λ ≈ d.

The van der Waals length a depends on the relative strength of liquid–liquid and liquid–

solid interactions. The Hamaker constant for the pair ﬂuid–solid is deﬁned [3] as

8

A = π2n(Csns − Cf n) ≡ π2n2eC,

(13)

where Cs, Cf are constants in the long-range attraction potential C/r6, respectively, for the

pairs of ﬂuid–solid and ﬂuid–ﬂuid atoms removed at the distance r; ns is the solid number

assume A > 0, which corresponds to the case of complete wetting. The estimate for surface

density; The eﬀective interaction parameter eC is deﬁned by the above identity. We shall
24 πCf (n/d)−2. This gives a ≈ 2ǫ−1(eC/Cf )1/2, so that a = O(d) when
tension [3] is σ ≈ 1
eC/Cf = O(ǫ2).

IV. INTERMEDIATE ASYMPTOTICS

In the intermediate region, where h far exceeds the microscopic scales d, a, λ but is still

far less than the capillary length b, the ﬁlm proﬁle is determined by the balance between

viscous stress and surface tension. The asymptotics of the truncated Eq. (10) (with d, a, λ,

and b−1 set to zero) at h → ∞ is
y ≍ 3Ca ln

9 (cid:19)2/3

h

h0!2/3

ln ln

h

h0  ln

h

h0!−1/3

+ . . . ,

(14)

where h0 is an indeﬁnite constant. The ﬁrst term of this asymptotic expression has been

obtained by Hervet and de Gennes [29], who have also reported the value of h0. This constant

can be obtained by integrating Eq. (10) (with gravity neglected) starting from the boundary

condition (11) or (12) and adjusting another necessary boundary value to avoid runaway

to ±∞. There is a unique heteroclinic trajectory approaching the asymptotics (14). It is
very sensitive to the initial conditions as well as to the molecular-scale factors operating

close to the contact line. The growth of the inclination angle is never saturated, as long as

macroscopic factors (gravity or volume constraint) are not taken into account.

Equation (10) can be integrated using the shooting method: either starting from the

boundary condition (11) and adjusting y ′(d) or starting from the boundary condition (12)

9

and adjusting y(d) to arrive at the required asymptotics at h → ∞. Further on, we will
measure all lengths in the molecular units and set d to unity. The solution in the intermediate

region depends on the physical parameters a, λ as well as on the capillary number Ca that

includes the propagation speed U. The latter’s impact is most interesting for our purpose.

Examples of the computed dependence of the inclination angle θ =qy(h) on the local ﬁlm

thickness h using the boundary condition (11) at diﬀerent values of Ca are given in Fig. 1.

The curves using the boundary condition (12) in Fig. 1b, show peculiar (apparently, non-

physical) reversal of the dependence of the inclination angle on Ca, resulting in an increase

of the “true” contact angle θ(d) with decreasing velocity. Indeed, at U → 0 this condition
yields a spurious balance between intermolecular forces and surface tension leading to an

unstable stationary state, similar to the erroneous inference of a wetting ﬁlm with the right

contact angle in Ref. [30] discussed in our earlier paper [31]. The anomaly, however, quickly

disappears at observable distances.

The curve segments at h ≫ 1 can be ﬁt to the asymptotic formula (14) to obtain the
integration constant h0. It should be noted that the asymptotic formula (14) can be used

only when h is logarithmically large, and the convergence, as estimated by the second term,

is slow; therefore h0 can be only obtained approximately from the computed proﬁles. The

dependence of h0 on Ca based on Fig. 1a is shown in Fig. 2. We see here a rather strong

variation of the integration constant, unlike a single “universal” value reported in Ref. [29].

V. DRAW-DOWN OF A MENISCUS

The simplest stationary arrangement including gravity is realized when an inclined plane,

dry at x → −∞ slides in the direction of a wetting layer. Solving Eq. (10) with the same
boundary condition (12) as before brings now to the asymptotics y = √α at h → ∞ that

corresponds to a horizontal layer.

The curves y(h) seen in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c all depart from the intermediate asymptotic

curve obtained for inﬁnite b as in the preceding Section. However, due to extreme sensitivity

10

of the shooting method to the choice of the missing initial value, one has to integrate from

the outset the full equation rather than trying to start integration from some point on the

intermediate asymptotic curve. One can see that the maximum inclination angle (which may

be identiﬁed with the “visible” contact angle) grows as b decreases. This increase is, however,

not pronounced when the initial incline (identiﬁed with the “true” contact angle) is high.

One can distinguish therefore between two possibilities: ﬁrst, when the main dissipation is

due to kinetic resistance in the ﬁrst monomolecular layer that raises y(d), and second when

the viscous dissipation prevails and the inclination angle keeps growing in the region of bulk

ﬂow. Take note that even in the latter case the region where the inclination and curvature

are high are close to the contact line when measured on a macroscopic scale.

Figure 4 shows the dependence of the “visible” contact angle θm, deﬁned as the maximum

inclination angle and observed in the range where the gravity-dependent curves depart from
the intermediate asymptotics, on the capillary number Ca. The lower curve is a ﬁt θ ∝ Ca1/3
to the data of Fig. 3b. The points of the upper curve are computed in a similar way using

the boundary condition (12). The ﬁrst result appears to be more physically reasonable, since

the angle drops close to zero at small ﬂow velocities, while in the alternative computation

it remains ﬁnite (see also the discussion in the preceding Section). The proportionality of

the inclination angle to Ca1/3 (which leads to the well-known Tanners law of spreading [4])

is a property of the intermediate asymptotics (14) that can be deduced from scaling [31],

although the universality is slightly impaired by the dependence of the integration constant

h0 on velocity seen in Fig. 2.. The one-third law is inherited by the dependence θm(Ca),

since the inclination angle reaches its maximum while the gravity-dependent proﬁle is still

close to the intermediate asymptotic curve.

Fig. 5 shows the actual shape of the meniscus obtained by integrating the equation

h′(x) = qy(h), h(0) = d. The dependence of the draw-down length ∆ (computed as the

diﬀerence between the actual position of the contact line and the point where the continua-

tion of the asymptotic planar interface hits the solid surface) on the gravity length is shown

in Fig. 6.

11

VI. CONCLUSION

It comes, of course, as no surprise that introducing a molecular cut-oﬀ and applying a

kinetic slip condition to the ﬁrst molecular layer resolves the notorious singularities of hy-

drodynamic description. The hydrodynamic singularities are eliminated, however, only at

molecular distances, and are still felt in sharp interface curvatures at microscopic distances

identiﬁed here as the intermediate asymptotic region. The computations are eased consid-

erably when non-physical divergence of both viscous stress and attractive Lennard– Jones

potential beyond the cut-oﬀ limit are eliminated. As a result, the stationary equations can

be solved by shooting method with reasonable accuracy in a very wide range extending from

molecular to macroscopic scales, and the “true” contact angle at the cut-oﬀ distance can be

deﬁned unequivocally.

The “true” angle (unobservable by available techniques) depends on the slip length as

well as on the edge propagation speed, but not on gravity or asymptotic inclination angle.

These macroscopic factors inﬂuence, however, the “visible” contact angle observed in the

interval where the actual ﬁlm proﬁle departs from the intermediate asymptotic curve. Since

the latters location, though not shape, depends on the molecular-scale factors, as well as on

the cut-oﬀ distance, the visible angle depends on both molecular and macroscopic factors.

Thus, the lack of simple recipes for predicting the value of dynamic contact angle is deeply

rooted in the mesoscopic character of the contact line.

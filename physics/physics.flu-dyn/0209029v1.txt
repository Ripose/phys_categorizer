Length Scales of Acceleration for Locally Isotropic Turbulence

Reginald J. Hill
Environmental Technology Laboratory, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80305
(Dated: December 31, 2013)

Length scales are determined that govern the behavior at small separations of the correlations of
ﬂuid-particle acceleration, viscous force, and pressure gradient. The length scales and an associated
universal constant are quantiﬁed on the basis of published data. The length scale governing pressure
spectra at high wave numbers is discussed. Fluid-particle acceleration correlation is governed by
two length scales; one arises from the pressure gradient, the other from the viscous force.

PACS numbers: 47.27.Ak, 47.27.Gs

Accelerations in turbulent ﬂow are violent [1] and
are important to many types of studies. Experiments
in which particles are tracked in turbulence have found
accelerations as large as 1500 times that of gravity and
have quantiﬁed the probability density of accelerations
to show that extreme events are likely because the ac-
celerations are highly intermittent [1].
Understand-
ing turbulent accelerations is essential to many studies,
including dispersion and settling of particles in turbu-
lence [2][3], other interactions of bubbles and particles
in turbulence [3], eﬀects on ﬂying insects [1], pollutant
transport [4], and to the applicability of Taylor’s hy-
pothesis [5][6]. Turbulent accelerations are the object
of several studies aimed at solving the mystery of rain
onset from liquid-water clouds; the accelerations aﬀect
collision-coalescence, preferential concentration, and lo-
cal supersaturation [7]. To advance understanding of
turbulent accelerations, the length scales of acceleration
correlations are quantiﬁed here, and those scales are dis-
cussed in connection with the scaling of the pressure spec-
trum by Gotoh and Fukayama [8] and the inertial-range
scale found for fourth-order velocity structure functions
by Kerr et al. [9].

[10].

Universal scaling of the small-scales of turbulence
and its analogue in other areas of physics are discussed
in Ref.
The K41 [11] scaling parameters are
mean energy dissipation rate ε and kinematic viscos-
ity ν. Traditional scaling uses K41 scaling of small-
scale statistics, and seeks the resultant Rλ dependence
of the scaled statistic [12][10]; that Rλ dependence is
λT /ν is
akin to symmetry breaking. Here, Rλ ≡ (cid:10)
the Reynolds number, where Taylor’s [2] length scale is
λT ≡ h(cid:10)
of one component of velocity.
is a prop-
erty of the large-scale structure, so is Rλ. A radical de-
parture from tradition is to deduce scaling relationships
from relationships amongst statistics as determined from
the equations of motion. That method leads, for exam-
ple, to the assertion that mean-squared pressure-gradient
scales with an integral of the fourth-order velocity struc-
ture function [13]; for such deduced scaling, there is no
residual dependence on large-scale parameters [13]. The
deductive method is extended herein to the length scales

appear herein. However, the deductive theory does not
explicitly contain K41 scales or Rλ.

Thus, λ1 is the scaling length for the longitudinal com-

In
Eq. (4), hQ is given in terms of 3 of the 4 fourth-order
invariants determined by Siggia [19], where sij is the rate
of strain tensor and ωk is the vorticity. The invariant
missing from Eq. (4) is the one that Siggia [19] expected
to vary with Rλ diﬀerently than the other 3, so there is no
conﬂict with the expectation expressed in Ref. [14] that
hQ becomes a constant at large Reynolds number. Also,

responding length scale of the transverse component of
the pressure gradient correlation is 31/2λ1 (Ref. [14] Eq.
ip′
(61)), and that of
λ1. The analo-
(cid:11)
gous length scale of Dp (r) is √6λ1 (Ref. [14] Eq.(38), et
seqq.). The above shows that to cause pressure-gradient
correlations to coincide near the origin of a graph, one di-
vides them by χ and uses r/λ1 on the abscissa; for DP (r),
2
DP (r) /χλ
1 should be on the ordinate with r/λ1 on the
abscissa. The pressure spectrum is the sine transform
of the pressure-gradient correlation [Ref. [14], Eqs. (15),
(22a)]. Because λ1 scales the pressure-gradient correla-
tion at small r, it follows that to cause pressure spectra
to coincide at viscous-range wave numbers, one should
3
divide the spectra by χλ
1 and use kλ1 on the abscissa (k
is wave number). A Reynolds number limitation for this
to be so is discussed near the end.

Kerr [20] and the experimental data of Tsinober et al.
[21], Pearson and Antonia [22], and Zhou and Antonia
[23], can be used to calculate hQ; the result is shown in
Fig. 1. As suggested by the error bars, the data of Zhou
and Antonia do not give a reliable value of hQ, but those
data are consistent, within experimental error, with the
other data. The data of Pearson and Antonia [22] (see
their Fig. 7), for which error bars are not available, have
scatter similar to those of Ref. [23]. However, by ﬁtting
their data to straight lines over a broad range of Rλ,
Pearson and Antonia [22] mitigate random error to ﬁnd
that for 37 < Rλ < 103, D(∂x1u2)
E = 5.52
2
E = 0.84. Use of
E / D(∂x1u1)
(∂x1u2)
and D(∂x1u1)
Eq. (3) then gives hQ = 0.32; that value is shown as the
solid line extending over the range 37 < Rλ < 103 in Fig.
1. Note the slight increase of hQ with decreasing Rλ at
Rλ < 20. The data of Refs.
[20]-[22] are in such good
agreement that hQ is probably independent of Rλ for the
range 20 < Rλ < 103, wherein hQ ≃
0.3, and this value

might persist for Rλ → ∞
Because λ1 is essential for scaling, we next quan-
tify it by means of existing phenomenology. Use of ex-
isting phenomenology requires use of the K41 accelera-

We emphasize that the theory [14] does not contain K41
scaling. Use of Eq. (5) leads to asymptotic expressions
for λ1 for high and low Rλ as follows. On the basis

give length scales λV11 /√2 and λV11 /
5/3, respectively.
Kolmogorov’s equation can relate the velocity-derivative
moments in Eq. (13) to other high-order derivative mo-
ments; this gives the same result as would beginning with
the relationship of Vij (r) to Dij (r) in Eq. (10). The
diﬃculty of observing the initial fall-oﬀ of V11 (r), and
hence its length scale λV11 is clearly illustrated in Fig. 3
[16] and their discus-

sions; one requires a spatial resolution substantially ﬁner
than η. Such ﬁne resolution data is not yet available.
The high-order derivative moments in the denominator
of Eq. (13) likewise require ﬁne spatial resolution; their
Reynolds-number dependence has not been investigated,
but it would be surprising if they obey K41 scaling.

[15] and Fig. 13 of Ref.

Despite these diﬃculties, we can obtain the r-
values at which V11 (r) /V11 (0) = 0.5, and similarly for
the transverse component, from the graphs of those cor-
relation coeﬃcients in Fig. 13 of Ref.
[16]; the r-values
are 3.5η and 2.5η for longitudinal and transverse compo-
nents, respectively. Limited to Rλ = 230 of the DNS

estimates of these length scales. It is not suggested that
these length scales maintain ﬁxed ratio to η as Rλ varies.

As a result of the diﬀering length scales of D∂xi p∂x′

and Vij (r), the theory requires that the initial fall-oﬀ of
the longitudinal component A11 (r) be described by two
length scales; the same is true for the transverse com-
ponent and for Aii (r). For example, consider the trace
Aii (r) and Rλ = 230. From the above discussion we
have λV11 = 3.5η such that λVii = λV11 /

It is not implied that the two length scales main-
tain ﬁxed ratio as Rλ varies; the example above is for
Rλ = 230.

We noted above that to cause pressure spectra to
coincide at viscous-range wave numbers, one should di-
3
vide the spectra by χλ
1 and use kλ1 on the abscissa.
However, the Reynolds number must be large enough
that, at high wave numbers, the pressure spectrum has
negligible contributions from the sine transform of the
pressure-gradient correlation at r on the order of the in-
tegral scale. How large is large enough?
From the
pressure spectra from isotropic DNS shown in Fig. 5 of
Gotoh and Fukayama [8], where kη is the abscissa, com-
bined with the weak variation of λ1/η shown in Fig. 2
for 100 < Rλ < 400, it seems that Rλ & 200 is large
enough. Of course, no such limitation applies to scaling
E and Dp (r) with the parameters χ and λ1.

length scale within the inertial range of fourth-order
velocity structure functions (Dijkl (r)) such that scal-

structure function which is, in turn, related to Aij (r)
(Eqs. 9, 10, A4, A5 of Ref. [25]). Taylor series expan-
sion of those relationships shows that λ1 is a scale of, at
least, linear combinations of the nonzero components of
Dijkl (r). From Fig. 2 of Ref. [9], their empirical scale
is about 5 times λ1; on the other hand, λ1 is only the
E. Further work is needed to

Reynolds number. Whether or not λ1/η continues the
weak downward trend shown in Fig. 2 or becomes con-

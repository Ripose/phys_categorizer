Generalized Set of Boussinesq equations for surf zone region
R. Dutta 1 and J. Veeramony 2

Abstract

In this report, generalized wave breaking equations are developed using
three dimensional fully nonlinear extended Boussinesq equations to encompass
rotational dynamics in wave breaking zone. The derivation for vorticity distri-
butions are developed from Reynold based stress equations.

Keywords: Wave breaking, Boussinesq equation, shallow water, surf zone.

1 Introduction

Wave breaking is one of the most complex phenomena that occurs in the nearshore
region. During propagation of wave from deep to shallow water, the wave ﬁeld is
transformed due to shoaling and close to the shoreline, they become unstable and
break. In the process of breaking, energy is redistributed from fairly organized wave
motion to small scale turbulence, large scale currents and waves.

It has been shown by numerous researchers that Boussinesq-type equations for
varying water depth can describe nonlinear transformation in the shoaling region
quite well. In the last couple of decades, a lot of research eﬀort has gone into im-
proving the predictive capability of these equations in the intermediate water-depth
and close to the surf zone (see e.g. Nwogu [1983], Madsen[5] , Wei [1995]). It was
established that to extend the validity of these equations to the deep water, higher
order dispersive terms will have to be retained, and to improve the predictive capa-
bility close to breaking, the nonlinear terms will all have to be retained. However,
to model wave breaking, these models use additional terms that artiﬁcially added to
the momentum equation, which would then reproduce the main characteristic of a
breaking wave, i.e. the reduction in wave height. For example, wave breaking in FUN-
WAVE (FUNWAVE is based on the model described by Nwogu [1993]) is modeled
by introducing momentum mixing term developed by Kennedy et al [1999].

Most progress have been done for potential ﬂow, starting with the work of Nwogu
[1993] and Madsen [1983]. Some work have also been done to address partially ro-
tational ﬂows by Shen [2000]. In the breaking region and in the surf zone, the wave

breaking introduces vorticity into the ﬂuid. To address this problem, Veeramony &
Svendsen [2000] derived breaking terms in Boussinesq equation assuming ﬂow as two-
dimensional rotational ﬂow. Here, the breaking process is modeled by assuming that
vorticity is generated in the roller region of the breaking wave and solving vorticity
transport equation to determine the distribution of the vorticity. This naturally intro-
duces additional terms in the momentum equation which causes wave height reduction
as well as changes in the velocity ﬁeld. However, since this model is based on stream
function formulation, it cannot be trivially extended to three-dimensional ﬂow. The
phenomena of wave breaking in Boussinesq equations are being modeled using quite
few techniques which can preserve the wave shape as well as include energy dissipa-
tion mechanism. Shen [2000] developed a generalized form of Bousinesq equation in
3D vortical ﬂow ﬁeld with arbitrary vorticity distribution up to O(µ2). But he did
not describe momentum transport equation with full description of rotational ﬂow.
Recently, Zou et al [2004] addressed the problem by including the higher order terms
in Boussinesq equation in 2D ﬂow. This model solves to vorticity distribution based
on the parametric form taken form surface roller data. In this paper, we try to de-
velop a general form for breaking term for fully nonlinear set of Boussinesq equations
for three dimensional vortical ﬂow ﬁeld near surf zone region. Derivation of breaking
term from Reynold stress based vorticity transport equation was also developed to
describe rotational ﬁeld as a complete model of Veeramony [2000].

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the basic governing equa-
tions for continuity and momentum with boundary conditions. Section 3 describes
the equation for horizontal and vertical velocity distribution for potential and rota-
tional components. In section 4, the breaking term is derived for velocity transport
equation for fully nonlinear case and solved vorticity transport equation analytically
from fourier series expansion. In last section, results were discussed with conclusion.

2 Basic Equations

We consider a three-dimensional wave ﬁeld with free surface η(x, y, t) propagating over
a variable water depth h(x, y). As we are primarily concerned with wave breaking,
we only consider here wave propagation in shallow water. Wave in this region can be
characterized by two non-dimensional parameters δ = a/h and µ = h/l where a is the
characteristic wave amplitude and l the characteristic wave length. The parameter µ
is a measure of frequency dispersion and δ that of the nonlinearity of the wave. In this
study, since we are only considering shallow water waves, we only have to consider
weakly dispersive waves (upto O(µ2)) but have to retain all nonlinear terms.

Since the ﬂuid ﬂow is rotational, we also have three dimensional vorticity ﬁeld

s = (sx, sy, sz) in the ﬂuid deﬁned as

where ▽ = (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z). The continuity equation then becomes,

Here ▽ · u = (∂u/∂x, ∂v/∂y). The above equations satisfy two boundary conditions
for velocity at bottom and at free surface. At the free surface z = η(x, y, t), since
particles are free to move with ﬂuid velocity, the kinematic boundary condition is

and at bottom z = −h(x , y)

where uη = (uη, vη) is two component horizontal surface velocity. ▽η = (ηx, ηy),
▽h = (hx, hy) refer to horizontal derivative with respect to x and y in all subse-
quent calculations. The horizontal component for vorticity ﬁeld s = (sy, −sx) can be

In the above equation, once w solved, horizontal component of velocity u, v can
be solved from vorticity relation. In weakly hydrostatic case ( 0 < µ2 ≪ 1 ), solution
is typically obtained from iterative perturbation procedure with successive correction
term up to µ2.

In case of breaking waves where vorticity is very strong, so (∂u/∂z ∼ O(1)). We
assume solution as, u = uo + µ2u1 + O(µ4) and w = w0 + µ2w1 + O(µ4) for horizontal
and vertical velocity component.

vorticity is developed non uniformly, the equations become simpler with the choice of

assume solution for velocity comes also from rotational contribution due to vorticity at

Equation for horizontal velocity

In the surf zone, vorticity grows very strongly as a non uniform function over depth.
Following Shen [2000], we deﬁne reference velocity as ˜u = ¯u + △¯u − ηsη in terms
of depth average velocity ¯u and magnitude of vorticity at free surface sη with the
assumption of ▽ · s 6= 0. we set here zr = η as linear calibration for zr = r(η + h) − h
does not hold here in presence of nonuniform velocity as wave dispersion properties
change both spatially and temporally with vorticity. And boundary condition can be
set as

∂w
∂z

|η = ▽ · ˜u + η(▽ · sη)

Integrating equation (9) from bottom to surface and applying boundary condition

to (16) we get w0 as ,

w0 = wb0 − (−▽ · ˜u + η▽ · sη)Hz − Sw0

added to surface velocity.

Now, once w0 is calculated, u1 can be calculated from eqn (15) with surface

boundary condition [u0]η = um and [u1]η = 0
Finally, we calculate horizontal velocity as

4 Breaking Model [fully nonlinear case]

Conventional time dependent Boussinesq equations for surface wave height and con-
sequent breaking term calculation are very straight forward and published previously
in case of irrotational waves. Here we take up fully nonlinear calculation as vortic-
ity becomes a large fraction of water depth in the surf zone or shoaling waves. So,
while developing Boussinesq equations for horizontal momentum, we retain up to
order O(δ2) and O(δµ2) in our fully nonlinear calculation. Fully nonlinear Boussi-
nesq equations for long wave have been derived by Mei [1983] for ﬂat bottom and
by Wei et al [1995] for variable bottom surface in case of irrotational wave. Shen
[2000] addressed problems in developing generalized three dimensional irrotational
propagating wave ﬁeld to include rotational motion in general did not describe the
vorticity breaking terms. For horizontal propagation of waves, the three dimensional
problem can be reduced in terms of two horizontal velocity by integrating over depth
and retaining up to order O(δ2) and O(δµ2) As horizontal velocity is governed by
momentum equation at the surface η by,

|η = (

|η + 1)▽η

In the surf zone region of sloping beach, waves break due to high vorticity and the
breaking of wave later being converted to turbulence. So horizontal variation of water
depth h(x , y) must be considered in this case. We express surface propagation equa-
tion in terms of average velocity description and total time derivative of horizontal
momentum can be written as,

This long wave momentum equation upon simpliﬁcation over ﬂat bottom case
can be compared to the one derived by Shen [2000] The vertical velocity can be
obtained similarly,

So, we can write the horizontal momentum equation as,

˜u is deﬁned in previous section. In contrast to the result by Shen [2000], additional
contribution factor here arises from vorticity variation which is signiﬁcant for surf
zone wave. Wei et al [1995] also breaking term for irrotational long wave momentum
equation over a variable bottom wave. The intermediate depth velocity zα is being
used there proportional to h instead of depth average velocity used here which may
not be valid inside the ﬂuid. The use of zr in our approach avoids this diﬃculty.
Finally we try to generalize equation by solving vorticity from vorticity transport
equation in next section.

5 Vorticity transport equation in breaking zone

Madsen and Svendsen [1983] used a cubic vertical distribution of rotational velocity
based on roller jump data which can not considered in three dimension case as it
is not guaranteed to bring accuracy in the simulation. So we try to solve vorticity
function from Reynold stress based equation.

Taking the curl on both sides and use vorticity function s = ▽ × u we get,

∂s
∂t

− (s · ▽)s + (u · ▽)s = ν▽2s

(s · ▽)s is ”vorticity stretching” factor due to change in gradient in vorticity. This
term leads to change of rotation of material particles present in the ﬂow to the beach.
Contribution of this term can not be incorporated from two dimension roller jump
data.

We generalize the equation in three dimension as

6 Conclusion

Finally we conclude here by developing a most generalized form of fully nonlin-
ear Boussinesq equations for wave propagation in surf zone region with variable
bathymetry with vorticity distribution from Vorticity Transport Equation(VTE). In
this wave breaking zone, vorticity generated by the shear stress of current is very
strong, so contribution to the surface velocity due to vorticity variation has signiﬁ-
cant contribution in ﬂuid ﬂow. These extra terms in generalized equation complicate
the numerical technique as these terms are present in the equation in multiple form
of equations for vorticity components which has to be solved in coupled solution tech-
nique. Veeramony [2000] used simplied the formulation by taking constant eddy vis-
cosity value but this oversimpliﬁed case may bring inaccuracy in calculation. Briganti
et.al [2004] formulated a numerical technique scheme to solve VTE using generalized
depth variable eddy viscosity ν = ν(x, y) in two dimension case. In three dimensional
formulation, the nonlinear terms in the vorticity transport equation(VTE) will com-
plicate the calculation and so proper numerical technique have to be developed. This
work is under way.

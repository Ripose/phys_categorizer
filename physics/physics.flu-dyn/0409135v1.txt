We showed that various expressions of stresses in diﬀerent
models of ﬂuids and in diﬀerent forms of applying Newton’s
Second Law can be chosen, however there is always one New-
ton’s Second Law which restricts and provides ﬂexibility in
these expressions. When ﬂuids are regarded as being made
of cells from a microscopic point of view, temperature force
(gradient of internal kinetic energy) can also drive them ﬂow.

While the pressure is the normal force acting on a sur-
face per unit area, the stress means the total force per
unit area essentially. However, for a given system of par-
ticle i from 1 to n with volume Ω, the stress has been
proven or widely used as

with mass mi and position vector ri for particle i, and
force fj→i acting on particle i by particle j. As the kinetic
energy term seems not represent any forces directly, Zhou
studied previous derivations for it and concluded that
the kinetic energy term was not physically grounded and
should be deleted from the stress expression just last year
[1]. In our recent work [2], we found that the kinetic en-
ergy term can be explained by collisions between particles
and walls surrounding the system. In other words, the
velocity related kinetic energy term represents the forces
in the collisions in a statistical way. As there has been
no doubt about the deﬁnition of the regular force term
in principle and we have already discussed it in detail
in our previous work for systems with periodic boundary
conditions [2], we will mainly discuss the kinetic energy
term in views of macroscopic and microscopic motions
based on Newton’s Second Law below.

Let us repeat Newton’s Second Law ﬁrst,

(mi ˙ri) = Fi, (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) ,

where Fi is the net force acting on particle i. For this
extremely well known law, we still want to emphasis that
it means the rate of the ”regular-force-induced”change of
the moment is equal to the regular force essentially. For
one particle, this is never a problem. For many particles,
if we simply add Eq. (4) for all particles and get

no problem either. Now let us consider a very short pe-
riod of time ∆t = t2−t1 > 0 (from t1 to t2 ) for the system
deﬁned with a ﬁxed space boundary. Suppose an extra
particle, particle i + 1, enters the ﬁxed space during this
period even with an unchanged velocity ˙rn+1. If we cal-
culate the momentum of the system at t1 and t2 as P1 =

not be needed either. The other is that the momentum
change due to any reasons will be accumulated, then, as
a resut, imagined forces might be needed. This discus-
sion for particle systems is very simple. For continuous
medium, the situation is quite similar, but we need to
bring these physics pictures. An expression for stress is
usually derived for continuous medium/ﬂuid, and so are
the problems for stress formula.

In 1950, Irving and Kirkwood derived their formula for
stress similar to the internal stress (below) by applying
statistical theory onto hydrodynamics [3]. We will apply
Newton’s Second Law in hydrodynamics and limit statis-
tics to necessary terms only, and will deal with various

our derivation by repeating some of their work. Let us
consider a continuous ﬂuid with mass density ρ (r; t) and
”local velocity” u (r; t) at the point r and time t. We now
imagine ω to be a space region somewhere in the interior
of the ﬂuid with ﬁxed boundary S. Since ω is ﬁxed, the
rate of change of momentum in it is

point p is the velocity of mass of centre of the portion
of the ﬂuid/material in a local small space region ∆ωp
around the point. Speciﬁcally we have

u (p; t)

ρ (r; t) dω =

ρ (r; t) v (r; t) dω,

The rate of ﬂow of momentum out through the surface
of ω is

where we use the integration representing the correspond-
ing summation and so will we do later. In this sense, a
group of microscopic particles can still be regarded as
a continuous medium in a small region. Let us deﬁne
internal velocity as

Rf =

ρ (r; t) u (r; t) u (r; t) · dS =

∇r · [ρuu] dω,

w (r; t) = v (r; t) − u (p; t) .

Then Eq. (13) leads to

where the direction of the surface dS is from inside to
outside, and the surface integral has been converted to
a volume integral by Gauss’ theorem. The body force
acting on the ﬂuid within ω due to external source is

Fe =

where X is the force per unit volume. The surface force

Let us call the region ∆ωp as cell p and assume that the
whole ﬂuid is made of these full cells and that there is no
overlap between any two cells. This motion separation is
useful. With Eq. (15), the total kinetic energy of the cell
p is the microscopic kinetic energy

K∆ωp =

ρ (r; t) v2 (r; t) dω = K∆ωp,mac + K∆ωp,int,

since ω is arbitrary. The last two equivalent equations
are usually called hydrodynamical equation of motion.
Actually they are Newton’s Second Law for ﬂuids. Later
we will read them in some views and thus get various
deﬁnitions of the stress accordingly. But before this, we
have to separate macroscopic motion from microscopic
motion.

It is known that each ”smallest” element of any ﬂuid
or material is a particle and the true motion of it is mi-
croscopic motion. Let us use v (r; t) to denote the mi-
croscopic velocity of the element. However we can see
their macroscopic motion only. One example is a ﬂowing
river, in which we can see the water is transporting, and
the transporting velocity at each macroscopic point can
be measured easily, while the motion of each individual
water molecule is not visible and its microscopic velocity
can not be easily measured. In most cases, the macro-
scopic and microscopic velocities are not the same. We
can also say the macroscopic motion is mass transport,
and the macroscopic velocity u (p; t) at a macroscopic

and the corresponding internal kinetic energy

K∆ωp,int =

ρ (r; t) w2 (r; t) dω.

It is also known that temperature represents internal ki-
netic energy. As a matter of fact, both macroscopic and
microscopic velocities and kinetic energies are dependent
on the velocity of the reference coordinate system.
If
temperature represented microscopic kinetic energy, it
would also be dependent on the reference coordinate sys-
tem. On the contrary, the internal velocity and internal
kinetic energy deﬁned above are independent on the ref-
erence coordinate system. So is the temperature repre-
senting the internal kinetic energy. We can not accept a
temperature dependent on the reference coordinate sys-
tem. Internal stress should also be independent on the
reference coordinate system.

Let us read Eq. (11), but for simplicity considering the
macroscopic motion only now. Every term in this equa-
tion has a clear physics picture. The ﬁrst left term Rc
is the total rate of change of momentum of the system,
including the part due to ﬂuid moving across the bound-
ary, which is not regular-force-induced. Then the second

2

left term Rf is used to delete this part. So the total left
side is the total rate of change of regular-force-induced
momentum. Then the right side must be pure regular
forces, no imagined force. The external force Fe is clear
and free from problems. The surface force Fs must be

Another point of view is to move Rf from the left side
to the right and put it into the term Fs, then the stress
becomes

and Eq. (11) changes into

For stress deﬁnition in Eq. (19), the term −ρuu repre-
sents an imagined force and one must use Newton’s Sec-
ond Law in the form of Eq. (20) and the term Rc must
include the part due to ﬂuid moving across the bound-
ary. So the deﬁnition of stress depends on how Newton’s

according to Newton’s Second Law. The ﬁrst left term

part due to ﬂuid’s microscopic moving across the bound-
ary, which is not regular-force-induced and cancelled by
the second left term R′

with the term −ρvv representing imagined forces, and

Actually the rate of ﬂow of momentum as early as in
Eq.
(8) is a statistical idea, so statistics is inevitable
here. The ﬁrst right statistical term −ρvv of Eq. (24)
for a microscopic particle implies that the particle has
the same probability appearing at any point of a certain
space region. Let us assume the region is the cell in which
the particle resides, then Eq. (15) results in the averaged
internal momentum at each point

ρ (r; t) w (r; t) = 0,

(27)

which does not mean no internal motion. Recognizing
the average nature for microscopic motion in Eq. (22)
and bringing Eq. (27) into it, we arrive at

R′

ρ (r; t) w (r; t) w (r; t) · dS.

Then Newton’s Second Law of Eq. (23) becomes

pure regular force term
For either case, we still have a further choice whether to
put Rw into Fs.
If we do so but keep Rf in left, the
stress becomes Irving and Kirkwood’s stress [3]

⇀⇀
π ik= −ρww+

⇀⇀
πf .

(31)

This stress will be zero in the example of ﬁgure 4 in
Zhou’s paper [1], as there is no internal motion in the
material. More interesting is that Rw is completely new,
when Eq. (30) is compared with Eq. (11). The right
sides of the two equations may be diﬀerent when micro-
scopic motion status is considered in Eq. (30). But this
diﬀerence is an accuracy problem. There is new physics
in the term Rw arising from diﬀerent models of the same
ﬂuid/material.

Suppose we study macroscopic properties of a ﬂuid or
material. As the same macroscopic motion may come

with diﬀerent internal motions, the macroscopic proper-
ties should be averaged ones over internal motions. For
a given cell with a ﬁxed macroscopic velocity u, if the
internal velocity direction of every microscopic particle
is rotated with a ﬁxed angle, the macroscopic motion is
not changed. So let us further assume that the internal
velocity w for any given microscopic particle has equal
probability in all directions with the same absolute value.
Then for any given surface S, we have averaged tensor
acting on it

some physical force background for Rw or k∇p (ηT ). If
we regard it as an additional regular force, we can deﬁne
the internal stress as

where the relation ε = 3

momentum transferred across the surface S, is the net
rate of that from inside to outside 1
2 ηkT1S and that from
2 ηkT2S, so T = 1
outside to inside 1
2 (T1 + T2) even if
inside temperature T1 and outside temperature T2 are in
diﬀerent cells and not equal.

Considering this statistical nature, Eq.

(29) can be

simpliﬁed as

Rw =

(35)

which means the net rate of momentum transferred into ω
due to microscopic particles’ internal motion penetrating
the boundary. At this moment it is an imagined force,
which can be put inside or outside of stress deﬁnition.
Considering the internal motion condition of Eq. (15),
we can easily recognize that the increased momentum
should go to macroscopic motion in ω, described with
u (p; t).

Now let us consider measurements of

the ﬂuid.
When some detector is placed into the ﬂuid to de-
tect/measure some property, the microscopic particles
will inevitably collide with it and the collision must be
detected/measured. If the detector is not moving with
the same velocity of the ﬂuid’s macroscopic motion, the
collision will be complicated and depend on many fac-
tors. So a point detector moving with the same macro-
scopic velocity of the ﬂuid at the point can measure some
intrinsic-like properties. In this case, the collisions be-
tween the ﬂuid particles and the detector is due to parti-
cle’s internal motion only, and the averaged force in the
collisions can be easily proven as ρww · S =ηkT S, here
S is the detector’s surface area exposed to the particles,
supposing the collisions are complete elastic. So we found

previous work [2], where the lattice translation motion is
macroscopic and the motion of particle in the MD cell is
internal for every cell.

As temperature is a fundamental physics quantity, we

may write Newton’s Second Law as

Rc + Rf = Fe + Fs + Ft,

(39)

where the temperature force Ft = −Rw. A simple ex-
periment can be done as follows to see the action of this
force. Just have a kettle with half-ﬁlled water, boil it a
few times to get rid of bubbles, cool it and let it calm
down to no visible motion for a while, and heat it again.
Then the water ﬂow is visible even without bubble and
before boiling. This ﬂow is due to the temperature force,
as the temperature is not even.

In summary, we have discussed many possibilities of
stress deﬁnitions for diﬀerent model of the ﬂuid/material
and how Newton’s Second Law is used in form. However
any stress deﬁnition will be meaningful only when it is
used in Newton’s Second Law and Newton’s Second Law
is applied correctly. By separating macroscopic motion
and internal motion from microscopic motion, we found
that the temperature force can also drive a ﬂuid ﬂow.

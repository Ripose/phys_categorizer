We investigate the collapse of an axisymmetric cavity or bubble inside a ﬂuid of small viscosity, like
water. Any eﬀects of the gas inside the cavity as well as of the ﬂuid viscosity are neglected. Using a
α, where
slender-body description, we show that the minimum radius of the cavity scales like h0
t′ is the time from collapse. The exponent α very slowly approaches a universal value according
ln(t′)). Thus, as observed in a number of recent experiments, the scaling
to α = 1/2 + 1/(4
can easily be interpreted as evidence of a single non-trivial scaling exponent. Our predictions are
conﬁrmed by numerical simulations.

Over the last decade, there has been considerable
progress in understanding the pinch-oﬀ of ﬂuid drops,
described by a set of universal scaling exponents, inde-
pendent of the initial conditions [1, 2]. The driving is
provided for by surface tension, the value of the expo-
nents depend on the forces opposing it: inertia, viscosity,
or combinations thereof. Bubble collapse appears to be
a special case of an inviscid ﬂuid drop breaking up inside
another inviscid ﬂuid, which is a well studied problem
2/3,
[3, 4, 5]: the minimum drop radius scales like h0
t′
where t′ = t0
t and t0 is the pinch-oﬀ time. Thus, huge
excitement was caused by the results of recent experi-
ments on the pinch-oﬀ of an air bubble [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], or
the collapse of a cavity [11] in water, which resulted in
a radically diﬀerent picture, in agreement with two ear-
lier studies [12, 13]. As demonstrated in detail in [10],
the air-water system corresponds to an inner “ﬂuid” of
vanishing inertia, surrounded by an ideal ﬂuid.

Firstly, the scaling exponent α was found to be close to
1/2, (typical values reported in the literature are 0.56 [9]
and 0.57 [10]), which means that breakup is much faster
than in the ﬂuid-ﬂuid case, and surface tension must be-
come irrelevant as a driving force. Secondly, the value
of α appeared to depend subtly on the initial condition
[11], and was typically found to be larger than 1/2. This
raised the possibility of an “anomalous” exponent, se-
lected by a mechanism as yet unknown. To illustrate the
qualitative appearance of the pinch-oﬀ of a bubble, in
Fig. 1 we show a temporal sequence of proﬁles, using
a full numerical simulation of the inviscid ﬂow equations
[5]. We conﬁne ourselves to axisymmetric ﬂow, which ex-
perimentally is found to be preserved down to a scale of a
micron [10], provided the experiment is aligned carefully
[9].

The only existing theoretical prediction [7, 11, 15] is
based on treating the bubble as a (slightly perturbed)
cylinder [12, 13]. This leads to the exponent being 1/2
with logarithmic corrections, a result which harks back to
the 1940’s [16]. Our numerics, to be reported below, are
inconsistent with this result. Moreover, a cylinder is not
a particularly good description of the actual proﬁles (cf.

late stages are dominated by inertia, as observed experimen-
tally [10].

Fig. 1), as has been remarked before [9]. In this Letter,
we present a systematic expansion in the slenderness of
the cavity, which is found to lead to a self-consistent de-
scription of pinch-oﬀ. Our results are in excellent agree-
ment with numerical simulations, and consistent with the
experimentally observed exponents.

Our approach is based on the standard description
[17, 18] of slender cavities, an assumption that is tested
self-consistently by showing that the cavity’s axial exten-
sion is greater than its radius. The inviscid, irrotational,
incompressible ﬂow u =

drives the problem. The capillary pressure will however
turns out to be subdominant, so the last term in (2) can
eﬀectively be neglected. Note that the resulting equation
is invariant under a rescaling of both space and time, as
both remaining terms are inertial (describing acceleration
and convection of a ﬂuid element). Thus dimensional
arguments do not work, and a more detailed analysis is
needed to ﬁx the scaling exponent. Note that (2) does
not conserve the volume of the cavity, whereas Fig. 1
assumes an incompressible gas inside the bubble. This
however only aﬀects the rounded ends of the bubble.

Our aim is to explain the observed scaling behavior
of the minimum cross section a0 = a(0, t), as well as
of the axial length scale ∆ of the proﬁle, which can be
(2a0/a′′0 )1/2,
characterized by the inverse curvature ∆
where a′′0 = a′′(0, t) and the prime denotes denotes a
derivative with respect to z. Experiments as well as our

own simulations show that a0

with β < α, thus the radius is small compared to the
axial extend at the minimum. This means that a(0, t)
can be neglected relative to ξ2
∆2 in the denominator
of the integral, except near the position ξ = 0 of the
minimum. In other words, the integral is dominated by
local contributions near the minimum. This will permit
us to ﬁnd equations of motion for the minimum in terms
of local quantities alone.

However, we now need another equation for the (time-

An analysis of (4)-(6) shows that the approach to the
singularity corresponds to an unstable ﬁxed point as τ

→
. As usual, this is the result of the freedom in the choice
∞
of singularity time t0, see for example [5]. The limit
α = 1/2 thus has to be imposed onto the system in order
to ﬁnd the physically relevant solution. From the ﬁrst
equation, one ﬁnds that α approaches 1/2 from above,
while the second equation says that δ goes to zero, but
remains positive. This guarantees the self-consistency of
our approximation, although β approaches α in the limit.
However, the approach of α and β toward their limiting
values is exceedingly slow, as seen from the expansion

where Γ is a constant which reﬂects the arbitrariness of
the timescale in (2). Thus the value of Γ necessarily de-
pends on initial conditions. However to leading order
α approaches its limiting value in a universal fashion.
Finally, for the self-consistency of our analysis we need
that the dimensionless parameter a′′0 goes to zero toward
pinch-oﬀ, as is indeed found from (6), owing to the slow-
ness with which δ converges toward zero.

We now turn to a detailed comparison with full nu-
merical simulations, not relying on any slenderness as-
sumption, by focusing on the late stages of the pinch-oﬀ

event shown in Fig. 1. To this end a suitably modiﬁed
version of the boundary integral code developed to exam-
ine inviscid droplet pinch-oﬀ [5] was used, as originally
reported in [14]. This involved two important modiﬁca-
tions: First, the boundary value operator (cf. Equation
(11) in [5]) has a zero eigenvalue in the case of the ab-
sence of an inner ﬂuid, corresponding to a change in the
bubble volume. This singularity is analytically removed
before the boundary integral operator is inverted, ﬁxing
the bubble volume. Second, due to the rapidity of bub-
ble pinch-oﬀ, the adaptive time-stepping used for droplet
pinch-oﬀ in [5] was replaced by a time-step halving pro-
cedure with error estimation.

A comparison of the numerical simulations with (7)
is given in Fig. 2. Using equation (3), the value of α
from the numerical simulations can be calculated as α =
t′∂t′ h0/h0, and the pinch-oﬀ time t0 is estimated from the
numerical data. The solid curve in Fig. 2 is the data from
the numerical simulation, the dashed curve is the leading
order prediction given by equation (7) with Γ = 0, and
the dotted curve includes the adjustable constant with
Γ = 0.1.

Data from the numerical simulations can be divided
12 < t′ <
into three regimes. From approximately 10−
4 the bubble is considered to be in the asymptotic
10−
regime, and it is seen that there is very good agreement
between the numerical data and the asymptotic theory:
the leading order theory with Γ = 0 accurately predicts
the extremely slow decrease in the numerically deter-
mined value of α, and the second order correction with
Γ = 0.1 improves the agreement between the asymptotic
theory and the numerical data. Equally good agreement
was found for numerical runs using other initial condi-
tions, provided that Γ was adjusted, as it is expected to
depend on initial conditions, as also observed in experi-
4 corresponds to a transitional
ment [11]. Time t′ > 10−

where surface tension is required to initiate pinch-oﬀ, to
an asymptotic state where surface tension is irrelevant.

Gordillo et al.

[7, 15] have previously predicted that
the minimum bubble radius h0 should scale with t′ ac-
cording to t′
0, using a method that in many
respects is similar to ours [15]. However, the crucial dif-
ference is that they do not treat the axial length scale ∆
as a dynamical variable as we do, but eﬀectively identify
∆ with some outer length scale. Indeed, if one replaces
a′′0 by a0 in (4), one recovers the scaling result of [15].
The conceptual diﬀerence between the two approaches
is illustrated further by Fig. 3, which shows the central
peak of ¨a from the full numerical simulation. The value
of ¨a rapidly drops to zero, eﬀectively providing the cutoﬀ
of the integral (2) at an axial length ∆, which is shrink-
β. So far, we have not been able to identify the

In Fig. 4 we plotted the numerically computed min-

In our earlier numerical simulations [14], as well as

minimum radius was represented by adjusting a single

It also highlights the need for more sophisticated plots
like Fig. 2 in the interpretation of future (experimental)
data.

To summarize, we have developed an asymptotic the-
ory for the collapse of an axisymmetric cavity. A novel
feature of this theory is a slow variation of the scaling ex-
ponents, whose leading order contributions are universal.
The slowness of the approach explains the experimental
observation of apparently new scaling exponents, whose
value may depend weakly on initial conditions.
It re-
mains to calculate the entire form of the central peak of
¨a, which according to Fig. 3 is universal. This will de-
termine the values of the constants Γ1 and Γ2. Other
challenges are the inclusion of non-axisymmetry [9] and
viscosity [10] into the theoretical description.

exponent ¯α = 0.559 from a least-square ﬁt to the nu-
merical data, a value which is close to those observed
experimentally [9, 10].

the average over α values shown in Fig. 2. The resulting

[20] Equation (2), as it stands, is however ill-posed. Namely,
if a(z, t) in the denominator of the integral operator is as-
sumed constant, the operator can be inverted by Fourier
transform. One ﬁnds that the high-wavenumber modes
of ¨a grow like exp(k√a), so the evolution (2) will soon be
polluted by short-wavelength noise. However, this prob-
lem can be dealt with completely by adding a small
“damping” term ǫ¨a′′a to the right hand side. Choosing
3, we ﬁnd that the evolution is completely sta-
ǫ = 10−

uniformly smaller than the other terms by more than 4
orders of magnitude.

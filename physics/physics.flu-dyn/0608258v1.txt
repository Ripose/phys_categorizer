(Dated: January 21, 2014)

The results of a comparative analysis between turbulent pipe ﬂow and drag reduced turbulent
pipe ﬂow by spanwise wall oscillation based upon a Karhunen-Lo`eve expansion are presented. The
turbulent ﬂow is generated by a direct numerical simulation at a Reynolds number Reτ = 150.
The spanwise wall oscillation is imposed as a velocity boundary condition with an amplitude of
A+ = 20 and a period of T + = 50. The ﬂow is driven by a constant pressure gradient, resulting in a
27% mean velocity increase with wall oscillation. The peaks of the Reynolds stress and root-mean-
squared velocities shift away from the wall and the Karhunen-Lo`eve dimension of the turbulent
attractor is reduced from 2453 to 102. The coherent vorticity structures are pushed away from the
wall into higher speed ﬂow, causing an increase of their advection speed of 34% as determined by a
normal speed locus. The mechanism of drag reduction by spanwise wall oscillation is discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade a signiﬁcant amount of work
has been performed investigating the structure of wall
bounded turbulence, with aims of understanding its self-
sustaining nature and discovering methods of control.1
One of the greatest potential beneﬁts for controlling tur-
bulence is drag reduction. As the mechanics of the diﬀer-
ent types of drag reduction are studied, the general class
of explanations on the mechanism behind it all revolve
around controlling the streamwise vortices and low speed
streaks.2,3 One such method of achieving drag reduction
is spanwise wall oscillation, ﬁrst discovered by Jung et
al.4 in 1992, and later conﬁrmed both numerically4,5,6,7
and experimentally,8,9,10,11,12,13 to reduce drag on the or-
der of 45%. The prevalent theory of the mechanism be-
hind this was investigated through direct numerical sim-
ulation of a turbulent channel ﬂow by Choi et al.6 and
experimentally conﬁrmed by Choi and Clayton.14 They
showed that the spatial correlation between the stream-
wise vortices and the low speed streaks are modiﬁed so
that high speed ﬂuid is ejected from the wall, and low
speed ﬂuid is swept towards the wall.

As supercomputing resources increase, direct numeri-
cal simulation (DNS) of turbulence continues to provide
an information rich testbed to investigate the questions
associated with the mechanisms behind turbulence and
turbulent drag reduction. DNS resolves all the scales of
turbulence and no turbulent model is needed providing
a three dimensional time history database of the entire
ﬂow ﬁeld. One of the methods used for mining these
DNS databases for information is the Karhunen-Lo`eve
(KL) decomposition, which extracts coherent structures
from the eigenfunctions of the two-point spatial correla-
tion tensor. This provides a non-conditionally based in-
vestigation that takes advantage of the richness of DNS.
The utility of this method is evident in the knowledge
is has produced so far, such as the discovery of prop-
agating structures (traveling waves) of constant phase
velocity that trigger bursting and sweeping events15,16,17

which has lead to the study of drag reduction by trav-
eling waves.2,18 Another study using KL examined the
energy transfer path from the applied pressure gradient
to the ﬂow through triad interaction of structures.19,20
In the realm of control, KL methods have been used to
produce drag reduction in a turbulent channel by phase
randomization of the structures21 and the eﬀect of drag
reduction by controlled wall normal suction and blowing
pushed the KL structures associated with shear modes
further away from the wall.22 The purpose of this study
is to use the KL framework to examine the diﬀerences
in the turbulent structures between the direct numeri-
cal simulations of turbulent pipe ﬂow and spanwise wall
oscillated pipe ﬂow.

In this study, turbulent pipe ﬂow was chosen as op-
posed to turbulent channel ﬂow, as it is a realistic ge-
ometry that is found in industry and is experimentally
accessible. The main diﬀerences between the two ﬂows is
that in turbulent pipe ﬂow the mean ﬂow proﬁle in the
pipe does not conform to the logarithmic law until much
higher Reynolds number23,24, and it is linearly stable to
inﬁnitesimal disturbances.25,26 The numerical diﬃculty
introduced by the singularity in polar-cylindrical coordi-
nates has limited the number of DNS studies in turbulent
pipe ﬂow.27,28,29,30,31 Likewise, the only other turbulent
drag reduction study by spanwise wall oscillation in a
pipe is that of Choi and Graham.9 To the best of our
knowledge the work presented here is the ﬁrst to extend
the KL method to spanwise wall oscillated turbulent pipe
ﬂow.

In previous work a DNS of turbulent pipe ﬂow for
Reτ = 150 was benchmarked and its KL expansion was
reported, forming the baseline for this study.32 In study-
ing the pipe KL decomposition, similar structures to
those found in the channel are reported, including the
presence of propagating modes. These modes are char-
acterized by a constant phase speed and are responsible
for the Reynolds stress production by interacting with
roll modes (streamwise vortices)15. The roll modes are
the energy storage in the turbulent system, and with-
out the interaction of the propagating waves, they slowly

decay33 on their own. As shown by Sirovich et al.,15,16
the propagating waves form a coherent inclined plane
wave packet that interacts with the roll modes, and when
given enough interaction time, the roll mode is destabi-
lized eventually resulting in a bursting event.15 In ad-
dition to the Reynolds stress that the bursting event
generates, energy is also transfered from the roll mode
to the propagating mode,19 which decay faster than the
roll mode33. In this paper we show that in the presence
of spanwise wall oscillation these propagating modes are
pushed away from the wall into higher speed ﬂow caus-
ing them to advect faster, giving the propagating waves
less time to interact with the roll modes. This leads to a
shorter lifespan of the propagating structures, and thus
less Reynolds stress production which results in drag re-
duction.

II. NUMERICAL METHODS

This study uses a spectral element Navier-Stokes solver
to generate globally high order turbulent data for pipe
ﬂow driven by a uniform pressure gradient in the stream-
wise direction.34,35 The nondimensional equations gov-
erning the ﬂuid are

∂u
∂t + u · ∇u = ∇P + 1

where the Reynolds number is Reτ = Uτ R/ν = 150,
with Uτ =
τw/ρ, where R is the radius of the pipe, ρ
is the density, τw is the wall shear stress, and ν is the
kinematic viscosity. In previous work,32 the simulation
was run for t+ = U 2
τ t/ν = 16800 viscous time units, and
the Karhunen-Lo`eve method was applied to examine the
propagating turbulent ﬂow structures of pipe ﬂow. The
simulation is repeated in this study but with spanwise
wall oscillation with wall velocity boundary conditions of
amplitude A+ = A/Uτ = 20 and period T + = U 2
τ T /ν =
50 (Vθ,wall = A+ sin(2πt/T +)). This is not intended to
be a parametric study and the amplitude and period were
chosen for the maximum drag reduction achievable before
relaminarization occurred.

The spectral element algorithm employs a geometri-
cally ﬂexible yet exponentially convergent spectral ele-
ment discretization in space, in this case allowing the
geometry to be ﬁtted to a cylinder. The domain is sub-
divided into elements, each containing a high-order (12th
order) Legendre Lagrangian interpolant.36 The Navier-
Stokes equations are solved in Cartesian coordinates with
the in a stadium like architecture, shown in Figure 1 to
avoid the numerical singularity found in polar-cylindrical
coordinates. The streamwise directions comprised of 40
such slices, providing a total length of the domain is 10 di-
ameters. The eﬀective resolution of the ﬂow near the wall
is ∆r+ ≈ 0.78 and ∆θ+ ≈ 4.9 where r is the radius and
θ is the azimuthal angle. Near the center of the pipe, the

ibility to snap to a circular domain.

spacing in Cartesian coordinates is ∆x+ = ∆y+ ≈ 3.1.
The streamwise grid spacing is a constant ∆z+ = 6.25
throughout the domain. Benchmarking of this code at
this current resolution is found in Duggleby et al.32

The forcing function is a constant pressure drop. This
was chosen to maintain the inner scaling of the turbu-
lence, by keeping the wall shear stress constant. The
eﬀect of the spanwise wall oscillation results in a mean
ﬂow rate increase, eﬀectively changing the outer scaling.
This keeps the dominant structures of the ﬂow similar, as
they are aﬀected primarily by the inner layer wall shear
stress.7 The oscillations were started on a fully turbulent
pipe, and data was not taken until the mean ﬂow rate
had settled at its new value for 1000t+.

The Karhunen-Lo`eve Decomposition (KL) is the solu-
tion of the eigenfunctions of the two-point velocity cor-
relation tensor, deﬁned by,

Kij(x, x′

) = hui(x)uj(x′

)i,

(3)

where ui(x) is the ﬂuctuating component of the velocity,
where the mean is determined by averaging over both
homogeneous planes and time. The angle brackets rep-
resent an average over many time steps, on the order of
t+ ≈ 40, 000 ∼ 50, 000, to sample the the entire attrac-
tor. The i and j represent the three orthogonal veloci-
ties, establishing the matrix of velocity correlation and
cross-correlations between every spatial point x and x′.
Taking into account the periodicity in the azimuthal and
streamwise direction and taking advantage of the orthog-
onality of the Fourier modes, the ﬁnal eigenvalue problem
becomes,

m and n are the wavenumbers in the streamwise and
spanwise (azimuthal) direction, and λ is the eigenvalue.
In the present problem, 2100 snapshots of the ﬂow
ﬁeld were taken, one snapshot for every 8 viscous time
steps. The Fourier transform of the data was then taken,
and the kernel built, with the mean ﬂow subtracted from
the ﬂow ﬁeld in order to focus on the ﬂuctuating com-
ponents of the turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld. This kernel was
then averaged over every snapshot to generate the ﬁ-
nal kernel to be decomposed. The eigenfunctions are
ranked in descending order with the quantum number
q to specify the particular eigenfunction associated with
the corresponding eigenvalue. Thus it requires a triplet
k = (n, m, q) to specify a given eigenfunction with eigen-
value λ(m,n,q) = λk.

The eigenfunctions Ψk(r) are complex vector functions
so that the inner product is of unit length (Φk, Φl) =
δkl, where δkl is the Kronecker delta. The eigenvalues
physically represent the average energy of the ﬂow in the
direction Φk,

λk = h|u, Φk

|2i.

(5)

The KL method yields an orthogonal set of eigenfunc-
tions that span the ﬂow ﬁeld, allowing the ﬂow ﬁeld to
be represented as an expansion in that basis. This allows
both the structure of the eigenfunctions and its time his-
tory to be studied.

the introduction, turbulent pipe ﬂow is not described by
the log law until much higher Reynolds number, as seen
in the non-oscillated case in Figure 3.

III. RESULTS

There are four main eﬀects on the ﬂow and its struc-

tures due to spanwise wall oscillation. They are:

n
a

u

,

1. An increase in ﬂow rate and a shifting away from
the wall of the root-mean-squared and Reynolds
stress peaks.

2. A reduction in the dimension of the chaotic attrac-

tor describing the turbulence.

3. An increase in energy of the lift modes while the
rest of the propagating wave classes decrease in en-
ergy.

4. An increase of the advection speed of the propagat-
ing wave packet as determined by a normal speed
locus.

The ﬁrst major eﬀect is the turbulent statistics. The
spanwise wall oscillation of amplitude A+ = 20 and pe-
riod T + = 50 resulted in a ﬂow rate increase of 26.9%,
shown in Figure 2. This amplitude and period combina-
tion was chosen because it provides the largest amount
of drag reduction while keeping the ﬂow turbulent, as
any larger oscillations completely relaminarize the ﬂow.

layer (u+ = log(y+)/0.41 + 5.5).

The comparison of the root-mean-square (rms) veloc-
ity ﬂuctuation proﬁles and the Reynolds stress proﬁle
in Figures 5 and 6 show that the streamwise ﬂuctua-
tions decrease in intensity from 2.68 to 2.48. Also, the
change in peak location from y+ = 16 to y+ = 22 cor-
responds with the maximum turbulent production term
(Reynolds stress). The azimuthal ﬂuctuating velocities
show a slightly greater magnitude peak of 1.03 near
y+ = 29 closer to the wall versus 0.99 at y+ = 40 for
the non-oscillated pipe. The radial ﬂuctuations remain
almost unchanged, showing only a slight weakening all

resulting in the peak shifting from 0.81 at y+ = 55 to
0.78 at y+ = 61. The Reynolds stress vzvr also shows a
reduction in strength and a shift away from the wall. The
peak changes from 0.68 at y+ = 31 to 0.63 at y+ = 38.
Thus, a major diﬀerence between the two ﬂow cases, in
addition to the expected ﬂow rate increase, is the shift of
the rms ﬂuctuations and Reynolds stress away from the
wall.

azimuthal rms which captures the Stokes layer imposed from
the wall oscillation.

The second major eﬀect is a reduction in the size of the
chaotic attractor describing the turbulence. The eigen-
values of the KLD represent the energy of each eigenfunc-
tion. By ordering the eigenvalues from largest to small-
est, the number of eigenfunctions needed to capture a
given percentage of energy of the ﬂow is minimized. Ta-
ble I shows the 25 most energetic eigenfunctions, and

Figure 7 shows the running total of energy versus mode
number. The 90% mark is reached at DKL = 102 com-
pared to DKL = 2453 for the non-oscillated case. This
mark, known as the Karhunen-Lo`eve dimension, is a mea-
sure of the intrinsic dimension of the chaotic attractor of
turbulence as discussed by Sirovich37,38. By oscillating
the wall our results show that the size of the attractor is
reduced.

The third major eﬀect is found by examining the top
25 most energetic eigenfunctions, listed in each case in
Table I, with the top ten modes with the largest energy
increase or decrease shown in Table II. Firstly, the order
of the eigenfunctions remains relatively unchanged, with
a couple noticeable diﬀerences. The (0,0,1) and (0,0,3)
shear modes represent the Stokes ﬂow as seen in Figure 8a
and 8c, and the (0,0,2) mode, shown in Figure 8b, mode

represents the changing of the mean ﬂow rate, similar to
the non-oscillated (0,0,1) mode. The (1,2,1) wall mode
shows a large increase in energy, and a signiﬁcant change
in structure, shown in Figure 11. Also of note is the
reduction in energy of the asymmetric modes (3,1,1) and
(4,1,1), but their structure remains virtually unchanged.
In examining the energy content of the structure sub-
classes, the propagating modes lose 9.02% of their en-
ergy, and the non-propagating shear and roll modes gain
found
2043%, shown in Table III. The wall modes,
when the spanwise wavenumber is larger than the stream-
wise wavenumber with coherent vortices near the wall,
decreases by 20.4%. Likewise, the ring modes which
are found for non-zero streamwise wavenumber and zero
spanwise wavenumber with rings of coherent vorticity, see
their energy decreased slightly by 5.2%. The asymmet-
ric modes, found with non-zero streamwise wavenumber
and spanwise wavenumber n = 1, undergo a decrease in
energy of 2.3%. Conversely, the lift modes, found with
greater streamwise than spanwise wavenumber and co-
herent vortex structures that lift away from the wall, in-
crease by 1.5%. Thus, the third major result is that the

energy of the propagating modes decrease except for the
energy of lift mode which increases slightly. The energy
spectra showing the change of energy in the subclasses is
shown in Figure 9.

The fourth and most important eﬀect is that the horse-
shoe structure, represented by the propagating modes,
advects faster in the oscillated case. The normal speed
locus of the top 50 most energetic modes of both cases
is shown in Figure 10. For this, the phase speed ω/kkk
is plotted in the direction k/kkk. When the locus is well
approximated by a circle, it is evidence that these struc-
tures propagate as a wave packet or envelope that travels
with a constant speed, denoted by intersection of the cir-
cle with the y-axis. By examining the normal speed locus
of the non-oscillated and non-oscillated pipe, the wave
packet shows an increase in advection speed from 8.41 to

wall to a faster mean ﬂow by creating a dominant near
wall Stokes layer where the turbulent structures cannot
form. This is conﬁrmed by the shifting of the rms and
Reynolds stresses reported earlier.

By examining the most energetic propagating mode for
each subclass, the shifting of the structures away from the
wall can be seen. As can be seen in Figures 11 through 20,
these structures, which represent the coherent vorticity
of the four subclasses of the propagating structure, are
pushed towards the center of the pipe, where the mean

that is less than in the purely spanwise oscillated case.

Thus, the ﬁnal major result is that faster advection by
shifting the structures away from the wall into higher ve-
locity mean ﬂow causes these structures to interact less
with the roll modes, reducing their lifetime and giving
them less time to generate Reynolds stress. From the
classical horseshoe structure formulation, this is equiv-
alent to the vortexes lifting and stretching faster, thus
dying faster, again resulting is less time to generate
Reynolds stress.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

This work has shown, through a Karhunen-Lo`eve anal-
ysis, four major consequences of spanwise wall oscillation
on the turbulent pipe ﬂow structures. They are: a shift-
ing of rms velocities and Reynolds stress away from the
wall; a reduction in the dimension of the chaotic attrac-
tor describing the turbulence; an increase in the energy
of the lift mode subclass and a decrease in the rest of the
propagating mode subclasses; and a shifting of the prop-
agating structures away from the wall into higher speed
ﬂow resulting in faster advection and shorter lifespans,
providing less time to generate Reynolds stress.

The strength of the KL method is that it is non-
conditional in its investigation, and thus we are able to
examine the entire ﬂow ﬁeld time history and examine the
eﬀect of the oscillation, where other studies focused on
discrete events such as sweeping and bursting. Therefore,
we argue that the mechanism of drag reduction through
spanwise wall oscillation, although it results in the decor-
relation of the low speed streaks and the streamwise vor-
tices, is the lifting of the turbulent structures away from
the wall by the Stokes ﬂow induced by the spanwise wall

ﬂow is higher. The coherent vorticity is deﬁned as the
complex eigenvalues of the rate of deformation tensor.39
The location of the coherent vortex core for these eight
modes are listed in Table IV, showing a shift away from
the wall. The only mode shown here not to follow this
trend is the (1,0,1) mode, which has its vortex core move
towards the wall. Also seen in these plots is the eﬀect
of the Stokes layer upon the near-wall coherent vorticity
of these structures, as they are qualitatively smeared,
creating a more deﬁned tail-like structure.

This result of faster advection explains the experimen-
tal results found by K.-S. Choi40 that showed a dura-
tion and strength reduction of sweep events in a span-
wise wall oscillated boundary layer by 78% and 64% re-
spectively. For this experiment, the ﬂowrate was kept
constant, so the energy was reduced, where our case the
pressure gradient was kept constant yielding virtually no
change in the energy of the propagating structures. Also
corroborating these results is the work by Prabhu et al.22
that examined the KL decomposition of controlled suc-
tion and blowing to reduce drag, and they too found that
the structures were pushed away from the wall and that
they had higher phase velocities. Thirdly, the study by
Zhou7 also corroborates with these results, as she found
that any oscillation in the streamwise direction reduces
the eﬀectiveness of the drag reduction. Any streamwise
oscillation, even though it would still push the structures
up, would adversely eﬀect the mean ﬂow rate proﬁle re-
sulting in an advection speed of the propagating waves

oscillation.

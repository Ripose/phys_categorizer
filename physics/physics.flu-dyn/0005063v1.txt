Scaling properties of an inviscid mean-motion ﬂuid model

Earth and Environmental Sciences, MS-B296, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545

B.T. Nadiga

An inviscid two-dimensional ﬂuid model with nonlinear dispersion that arises simultaneously in
coarse-grained descriptions of the dynamics of the Euler equation and in the description of non-
Newtonian ﬂuids of second grade is considered. The scaling of the equilibrium states of this model
for conserved energy and enstrophy retains the corresponding scaling for the Euler equations on the
large scales and at the same time greatly deemphasizes the importance of small scales. This is the
ﬁrst clear demonstration of the beneﬁcial eﬀect of nonlinear dispersion in the model, and should
highlight its utility as a subgrid model in more realistic situations.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1998, Holm et al.,1 using the Euler-Poincar´e varia-
tional formalism, proposed a model for the mean motion
of ideal incompressible ﬂuids. In this approach, the (re-
duced) Lagrangian, which for the incompressible case is
the kinetic energy, was modiﬁed from that for the Euler
equation:

l =

1

2Z |u|2 dx (= E) ,

to account for ﬂuctuation energy of the velocity ﬁeld in
conjunction with the introduction of a ﬂuctuation length
scale α:2

l =

1

2Z (cid:0)|u|2 + α2|∇u|2(cid:1) dx (= Eα) .

The resulting “α-model” for the Euler equations is

(1)

(2)

∂v
∂t

+ u · ∇v − α2 (∇u)T · ∇2u = −∇p
∇ · u = 0, v =(cid:0)1 − α2∇2(cid:1) u

where, when α is set to zero, v = u, and the usual Euler
equations are recovered. All other notation is standard.
These equations are envisaged as modeling the ﬂow of
inviscid incompressible ﬂuids at length scales larger than
α. (For proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions
of (2), see Shkoller3 and Cioranescu & Girault4 (viscous
case).)

Rivlin and Ericksen,5 in 1955, derived general consti-
tutive laws of the diﬀerential type for an incompressible
ﬂuid, wherein at the ﬁrst order, viscous Newtonian stress
results (ﬁrst grade ﬂuids), while at the next order invis-
cid, non-Newtonian, stress-strain relations appear (sec-
ond grade ﬂuids). Equations (2) are identically the equa-
tions governing inviscid second-grade ﬂuids, and where
now α is a material property. Viscous and inviscid sec-
ond grade ﬂuid ﬂows have since been studied from diﬀer-
ent viewpoints (e.g., see Dunn & Fosdick6 and references
therein, and Cioranescu & Girault4). We also note that
the variational formulation of (2) was already explicitly
noted in Cioranescu & Ouazar.7

The new derivation of (2) has, however, renewed in-
terest in them and besides spurring more mathematical

1

work has stimulated computational investigations of α-
models(e.g., 8–10) for the reason that the advection ve-
locity, u, is obtained by a spatial-average of the advected
ﬁeld v (inversion of the Helmholtz operator in (2)). This
results in a modiﬁcation of the advective nonlinearity,
the main nonlinearity of ﬂuid dynamics, in such a way
as to suppress mutual interactions between scales which
are smaller than α (as can be seen, for example, in the
untruncated version of (5) below when |m|,|n| > 2π/α).
This modiﬁcation is purely inviscid, and we will refer to
it simply as nonlinear-dispersion in what follows. How-
ever, with the exception of Nadiga & Shkoller,10 compu-
tational studies of α-models have always used additional
viscous terms: For example, Chen et al.8 (1998) examine
the applicability of a viscous α-model to model turbu-
lent channel ﬂow, and Chen et al.9 (1999) explore the
utility of a three-dimensional viscous α-model in provid-
ing a subgrid model for ﬂuid turbulence. While this is
clearly the appropriate direction to pursue in the context
of realistic applications, we think that studying purely
inviscid α-models, although idealized, is important and
will complement the study of their viscous counterparts.
In Nadiga and Shkoller,10 among other things, we pre-
sented a series of two-dimensional numerical computa-
tions comparing the solutions of Euler equations, Navier-
Stokes equations, and an Euler-α model, and showed that
the Euler-α model was able to reproduce the typical en-
strophy decay characteristics of the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions, but in a conservative setting. Presently, we address
some statistical scaling aspects of the dynamics of such
an Euler-α model to highlight its inviscid subgrid-scale
modeling features.

To better illustrate the eﬀects of nonlinear-dispersion,
the salient feature of all α-models, it suﬃces to consider
(2) in two-dimensions. In that case, it can be rewritten
in the vorticity-streamfunction formulation as

dq
dt

=

∂q
∂t

+ J[ψ, q] = 0

q =(cid:0)1 − α2∇2(cid:1) ω, ∇2ψ = ω,
where ψ is the streamfunction, ω is the vorticity, J is the
∂q
Jacobian operator so that J[ψ, q] = − ∂ψ
∂y , and
again, when α is set to zero, q = ω, and the usual Euler

∂x + ∂ψ

(3)

∂q

∂y

∂x

equations result. Equation (3) can be also be written as

∂ω
∂t

+(cid:0)1 − α2∇2(cid:1)−1

J[ψ,(cid:0)1 − α2∇2(cid:1) ω] = 0, ∇2ψ = ω,

a form that highlights the modiﬁcation to the J[ψ, ω]
nonlinear term of the Euler equations. Parenthetically,
we note that in going to two-dimensions, we lose analogs
of three-dimensional processes like vorticity stretching,
and therefore, fail to characterize the eﬀect of nonlinear-
dispersion on such processes.

The kinetic energy Eα (denoted by E when α = 0), as
deﬁned in (1), is an obvious constant of motion in both
two and three dimensions. However, in two dimensions,
unlike in three, the vorticity q (ω when α = 0) of each
ﬂuid element is an inviscid constant (see (3)), implying
an inﬁnity of conservation laws. In particular, enstrophy
Z α, deﬁned as

Z α =

1

2Z (cid:2)(cid:0)1 − α2∇2(cid:1) ω(cid:3)2

dx,

(4)

is a second conserved quadratic quantity. As before,
when α = 0, we represent the conserved enstrophy by Z.
(The domain integral of u · ω or helicity is a quadratic
quantity which is conserved in three dimensions, but
which is identically zero in two dimensions.)

The use of equilibrium statistical mechanical theo-
ries (for (3) with α = 0) to better understand the
inviscid dynamics of two-dimensional ﬂows range from
the two-constraint theory (see Kraichnan and Mont-
gomery11 and references therein) for ﬁnite truncations of
the continuous system, to those based on point vortices
(again see Kraichnan and Montgomery11 and references
therein) and their generalizations to continuous vorticity
ﬁelds12, 13 which consider the inﬁnity of conserved quanti-
ties. In this article, we present the two-constraint theory
for (3) and verify the main results of the theory compu-
tationally. Other than mentioning that there is already
some numerical evidence10 which seems to suggest that
individual solutions of the Euler-α model (3) may indeed
follow predictions made for the behavior of the ensemble-
averaged solutions of the Euler equations by the more
complicated statistical theories we do not consider such
theories any more in this short note. Also, since one
may be tempted to point to the shortcomings of the two-
constraint theory for the Euler equations before consid-
ering the utility of such a theory for the Euler-α model,
we wish to point out that the importance of this work lies
primarily in the comparison of the results for the Euler-α
model to the classical results for the Euler equations. In
so doing, the eﬀects of nonlinear-dispersion, and its bene-
ﬁcial numerical ramiﬁcations, are clearly highlighted. At
the risk of belaboring the point further, we reemphasize
that in considering the simple two constraint theory, we
are in no way suggesting that the behavior of the ensem-
ble averaged solution of the α-model (3) (or their slightly
viscous counterparts) will follow this theory in more real-
istic situations; the limitation of this theory in predicting

large-scale coherent structures in the α = 0 case is well
known,11 and carry over to the nonzero α case.

Furthermore, from a numerical point of view, invis-
cid computations of (3) which conserve two quadratic
invariants are fairly easily realizable and more common-
place than the more involved multisimplectic schemes
which are required for conserving a larger number of
constraints. Also, while state of the art schemes of the
latter kind can handle only tens of modes (because of
an N 3 log N scaling of computational work, where, N
is the number of modes14), there is no such restriction
on schemes of the former kind. Examples of schemes
which conserve just the energy and enstrophy invariants
are Fourier-Galerkin truncations implemented as a fully
dealiased pseudospectral spatial discreteization and the
second-order ﬁnite diﬀerence spatial discreteization us-
ing the Arakawa Jacobian. While we have done compu-
tations with both these schemes and see no discrepancy
between the results, we consider only the spectral dis-
cretization in this article since the theory presents itself
most naturally in this setting.

II. TWO-CONSTRAINT STATISTICAL THEORY

FOR (3)

Let qx represent a discretization of q on a two-
dimensional spatial grid, x, with 2N +1 equispaced points

grid points, and, k the set of all k is such that

vectors k = (kx, ky) denote the Fourier transform of
qx. Although there are (2N + 1)2 k-space grid points,
since qx is real, not all of them are independent and
−k. Therefore, there are only half as many k-space

on each side. Let bqk, where k is the set of all wave-
bqk =bq∗
However, since each bqk is a complex number, there are
overall (2N + 1)2 degrees of freedom in bqk. Consider the
truncation of (3) that is closed in bqk:

kmin ≤ kx, ky ≤ kmax} .

k ≡ {k = (kx, ky),

m × n

= 0.

Among the inﬁnity of conservations for the continuous
system (3) previously discussed, conservations (1) and
(4) are the only ones which survive for the truncated

system (5), and may be expressed in terms of bqk as
|bqk|2.

, Z α =

This follows from the detailed conservation property of
energy and enstrophy wherein each of these quantities is
conserved in every triad interaction.

(6)

Considering the dynamics of bqk under (5), we work

in the (2N + 1)2 dimensional phase space. As a conse-
quence of (3) satisfying a detailed Liouville theorem (see

2

Kraichnan and Montgomery11 and references therein),
(5) also satisﬁes a Liouville theorem and the motion of

can, therefore, deﬁne a stationary probability density, P ,

system within the ((2N + 1)2 dimensional) phase space

bqk in the truncated phase space is divergence free.11 We
such that PQk∈k dbqk is the probability of ﬁnding the
volumeQk∈k dbqk centered around bqk, and the ensemble
average of any quantity O, a function of bqk, as

(7)

hOi =Z OP Yk∈k

dbqk.

Next, a maximization of the information theoretic en-
tropy s, deﬁned in the usual fashion as

s = −hln P − 1i = −Z (P ln P − P ) Yk∈k

dbqk,

subject to constant ensemble-averaged energy and en-
strophy, hEαi and hZ αi respectively, leads to

P = a exp(−βEα − γZ α).

(8)

Here, β (an inverse temperature associated with energy)
and γ (an inverse temperature associated with enstro-
phy) are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the
two constraints, and a is determined from

Z P Yk∈k

dbqk = 1.

Making use of (6) in (8) then leads to a factorization of
the probability density:

P = aYk∈k

exp(cid:18)−|bqk|2(cid:18)

β

|k|2 (1 + α2|k|2)

+ γ(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(9)

The ensemble averaged two-dimensional spectral den-
sity is then computed using (7) and (9) (after noting the
expressions for the moments of a Gaussian) as

1
2h

hU α(k)i ≡

|k|2 (1 + α2|k|2)i =

β + γ|k|2 (1 + α2|k|2)
Since (the isotropic) one-dimensional spectra are more
convenient for plotting, we deﬁne

.

|bqk|2

Eα(|k|) = X|k|≤|j|<|k|+1

hU α(j)i,

so that Eα =X|k|

Eα(|k|).

In what follows, we drop the | · | sign on k and to avoid
confusion, note that while Eα represents the total con-
served energy, Eα(k), with a dependence on k, represents
the corresponding one-dimensional spectrum. The one-
dimensional spectrum Eα(k) is then seen to scale with k
as

Eα(k) ∼

k

β + γk2 (1 + α2k2)

,

(10)

3

with the above scaling being only approximate when the
mode spacing is not small compared to k (as at small k).
In (10), since α is a given length scale, once the dis-
cretization is ﬁxed, expressions for the total energy and
enstrophy of the given initial conditions provide two
equations to solve for β and γ. The equilibrium spectral
scaling (10) is then seen to exhibit three regimes depend-
ing on the values of the conserved energy and enstrophy
as follows. If the minimum and maximum wavenumbers
of the truncation are kmin and kmax respectively, and if
we deﬁne a mean wavenumber15 of the initial conditions
as,

k1 =r Z α

Eα ,

then, we can identify three regimes depending on the
signs of β and γ:

• If the initial conditions are such that the mean
wavenumber k1 is small: kmin ≤ k1 < ka, then the
temperature corresponding to energy is negative,
while that corresponding to enstrophy is positive:
−γk2
• If the mean wavenumber k1 is medium: ka < k1 <
kb, then both temperatures are positive: β > 0,
γ > 0;

min) < β < 0, γ > 0;

min(1 + α2k2

• If the mean wavenumber k1 is large: kb < k1 ≤
kmax, then the temperature corresponding to en-
ergy is positive while the temperature correspond-
ing to enstrophy is negative: β > 0, −β <
γk2

max(1 + α2k2

max) < 0.

Here, ka, and kb are constants depending on the ﬁlter
length α and the discretization:

k2
a =

.

(In the case of an inﬁnite domain, the ﬁrst of the above
cases, β < 0, cannot occur since ka = 0.)

Further, we can also compute the spectrum of the en-
ergy conserved by the Euler equation (E) under the dy-
namics of the Euler-α model. Noting that

E =

1

2Xk∈k

|k|2 (1 + α2|k|2)2 ,

|bqk|2

(an extra factor (1+α2|k|2) in the denominator compared
to the expression for Eα) and that E is not conserved
for α 6= 0, the scaling of its one-dimensional spectrum,
denoted simply by E(k), may be written as16

E(k) ∼

k

(1 + α2k2) (β + γk2 (1 + α2k2))

.

(11)

III. DISCUSSION AND COMPUTATIONAL

VERIFICATION OF RESULTS

We devote the remainder of the article to a discussion
of the scalings (10) and (11) and their computational
veriﬁcation. First, when α is set to zero in either (10)
or (11), the classic result of Kraichnan11 for the Euler
equation:

E(k) ∼

k

β + γk2

(12)

is recovered, with the three regions corresponding to the
diﬀerent combination of signs for β and γ now separated
by values of the mean wavenumber k1 corresponding to
ka and kb, where ka and kb are given by

k2
a =

.

As has been noted many times now11 for α = 0, there
is no discontinuity of any sort in going from one region
to the other among the three regions corresponding to
diﬀerent combinations of signs of β and γ. Therefore, for
convenience, we ﬁrst consider, in detail, the case β > 0
and γ > 0, and deﬁne

and note that

kα

∗ = k∗(cid:0)1 + O(α2k2
∗)(cid:1) .

Furthermore, k∗ can be shown17 to be of the order of k1.
(Thus, for simplicity in what follows, one may use k1,
1 , k∗, and kα
kα
∗ interchangably, or represent all of them
by k1.) For the Euler solutions, we have from (10) with
α = 0, the large scales and small scales (with respect to
k∗) behaving asymptotically as

E(k) ∼ k,
E(k) ∼ k−1,

kmin ≤ k ≪ k∗;
k∗ ≪ k ≤ kmax,

(13)

implying equipartition of E at large scales and equipar-
tition of Z at small scales. (When k ≪ k∗, γk2 ≪ β in
(12) and when k ≫ k∗, γk2 ≫ β in (12).) When α is not
zero, however, from (10), one easily sees the analogous
Eα- and Z α-equipartition results to be respectively

Eα(k) ∼ k,
Eα(k) ∼ k−3,

kmin ≤ k ≪ kα
∗ ;
kα
∗ ≪ k ≤ kmax.

(14)

This implies that nonlinear-dispersion in (3) acts in such
a way as to preserve the Euler scaling of dynamics

4

at the large scales while at the same time greatly
deemphasizing the importance of small scales.

Asymptotic scalings arising from (11), for the noncon-

served energy for α 6= 0:

E(k) ∼ k,
E(k) ∼ k−5,

kmin ≤ k ≪ kα
∗ ;
kα
∗ ≪ k ≤ kmax.

(15)

further reinforce this result. Finally, we note that for
α = 0, it is well known11 (and easy to see from (10)) that
when kmax → ∞, energy diverges logarithmically and
enstrophy diverges quadratically. However, when α 6= 0,
one can see from (10) that when kmax → ∞, energy is not
divergent and that the enstrophy Z α is quadratically di-
vergent. Nevertheless, in Nadiga and Shkoller,10 we show
that it is the dynamics of the non-conserved enstrophies

2R ω2dx and 1

dx which are actu-
ally interesting. While the former does not diverge, the
latter diverges only weakly (logarithmically).

We have carried out a series of computational exper-
iments on a doubly periodic two-dimensional domain,
wherein an ensemble of initial conditions were evolved
under (5) for diﬀerent values of α until statistical equili-
bration was achieved. Initial conditions, similar to those
in Fox and Orsag,18 were obtained by choosing ampli-
tudes for wavenumbers in the band 50 ≤ |k| ≤ 51 (zero
elsewhere) from a zero-mean normal distribution of ran-
dom numbers. The variance was scaled in such a way
that for the diﬀerent values of α, the conserved energy19
had the same value: Eα = E. The mean wavenumber k1
for this set of initial conditions corresponds to about 50.5,
and for the resolution chosen below, 28.5 ≤ ka ≤ 43.5,
and kb ≥ 60.1. With this setup, besides letting both β
and γ be positive, we can realize both the energy and
enstrophy equipartition regimes in the same experiment.
A fully dealiased pseudospectral spatial discretization
was used with kmin = 1, and kmax = N = 85, and
the nonlinear terms were computed in physical space us-
ing 256 grid points in each direction. A nominally ﬁfth-
order, adaptive time stepping, Runge-Kutta Cash-Karp
algorithm20 was used for time integration. Energy was
conserved to better than 1 in 105 and enstrophy to better
than 1 in 104 over the entire duration of the runs.

In Fig. 1, we plot the (instantaneous) spectrum Eα(k)
against k, on a log-log scale for four diﬀerent values of
α: 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15, corresponding to between 0
to 2.4 percent of the domain size. The spectrum for the
Euler case (α = 0) is oﬀset by a decade so as to not
clutter the ﬁgure, and slopes of 1, −1, and −3 are drawn
for reference. The scalings, (13) for α = 0, and (14) for
nonzero α, are clearly veriﬁed at both large and small
scales, in Fig. 1, with in fact a cleaner (but identical)
scaling of the large scales for nonzero α. Furthermore,
the three spectra corresponding to the nonzero-α cases
seem to collapse onto a single curve in Fig. 1. This col-
lapse may be explained by noting that almost all the
energy is contained in the low-k modes (denoted below

by the set of wavenumbers kE) and almost all enstrophy
is contained in the high-k modes (denoted below by the
set of wavenumbers kZ ). This leads to a leading order
expression for β which is independent of α:

that order. That is to say, besides their use in describ-
ing second-grade ﬂuids, α-models in general and (3) in
particular should be useful as a subgrid model in under-
resolved computations.

β(α) ∼XkE

k/E,

and one for γ which is inversely proportional to α2:

γ(α) ∼XkZ

k/(α2k2

1Z).

This in turn implies that the spectra (10) should be al-
most independent of α, except for a small intermediate
range of k.

and α = 0.05, 0.10, & 0.15. Low-k scaling is identical for zero
or nonzero α, but high-k scaling is much steeper for α 6= 0.
The theoretical asymptotic slopes are drawn for reference.

The above collapse of the nonzero-α spectra onto a sin-
gle curve seems to suggest that the actual value of α is
not very important as long as its value is in a certain
range. This, however, is not true as can be seen from the
structure of the E(k) spectrum plotted in Fig. 2 for the
same four cases. The theoretical scaling for this spec-
trum is given in (11) and the asymptotic scalings are
given in (15). Although the small scale behavior is as
expected, it is clear that with increasing α, the struc-
ture of the large scales is being substantially modiﬁed.
(Scaling (15) at large scales, can obviously be realized
by increasing the number of modes, but that is not our
intent here; we are examining the eﬀect of α at ﬁxed
resolution.) Therefore, a small value of α is indicated.
In such a case, the nonlinear-dispersion of the α-model
is highly beneﬁcial at small-scales while the large-scale
distortion is minimal. Considering that the minimally
resolved length scale in these computations corresponds
to about 0.074, one may conclude that α should be of

Spectrum falls oﬀ much faster (k−5) for α 6= 0 compared
to k−1 for α = 0, but the large-scales are also increasingly
changed with increasing α.

These conclusions are also borne out in numerical ex-
periments corresponding to the ﬂuid-dynamically more
interesting case wherein the temperature associated with
energy is negative (β < 0). As mentioned earlier, such
a case is obtained when the initial conditions are chosen
with energy and enstrophy such that k1 < ka. (As be-
fore, 28.5 ≤ ka ≤ 43.5 for the diﬀerent values of α for
the discretization chosen.) In such a case, there is a con-
densation of energy on to the low modes of the system11
resulting in large scale structures (necessarily coherent).
However, the enstrophy equipartition scaling of the spec-
tra discussed previously are unchanged. This gives us an
opportunity to better test the extent of distortion of the
low wavenumber (coherent) modes due to increasing α.
While various aspects of the negative temperature case
for nonzero α are considered in Nadiga and Shkoller,10 in
the spirit of this article, we presently consider only the
spectral distortion to the structure of the low wavenum-
ber (coherent) modes. In Fig. 3, where we plot the spec-
trum E(k) versus k again for α = 0, 0.05, 0.10, & 0.15,
and now where k1 ≈ 2. For this case, only one realization
(for each value of α) is considered and the spectrum cor-
responds to a long time average, for good measure, taken
after the system has reached statistical equilibrium. For
this suite of runs, energy was conserved to machine preci-
sion while enstrophy was conserved to about 0.3% for the
entire duration of the runs considered. The steep slope
of −5, for the small scales, for nonzero α (compared to a
slope of −1 for α = 0) is again veriﬁed and more impor-
tantly, for the case of α = 0.05, the low-mode structure
(up to k = 10) is almost identical to the case of α = 0.

This is clearly not the case for the two other values of
the ﬁlter length, α, which are greater than the smallest
resolved scale of the computation.

FIG. 3. Negative temperature case. Plot of E(k) vs. k for
α = 0, 0.05, 0.10, & 0.15. Small-scale spectrum falls oﬀ much
faster (k−5) for α 6= 0 compared to k−1 for α = 0. While the
large scale distortion is minimal for α=0.05, it is appreciable
for the other two cases with larger α.

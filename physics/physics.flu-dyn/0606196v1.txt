Abstract
The Gaussian-ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations are examined theoretically and a generalized the-
ory of their numerical stability is proposed. Using the exact expansion series of subﬁlter-scale
stresses or integration by parts, the terms describing the interaction between the mean and ﬂuctu-
ation portions in a statistically steady state are theoretically rewritten into a closed form in terms of
the known ﬁltered quantities. This process involves high-order derivatives with time-independent
coeﬃcients. Detailed stability analyses of the closed formulas are presented for determining whether
a ﬁltered system is numerically stable when ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes or others are used to solve it.
It is shown that by the Gaussian ﬁltering operation, second and higher even-order derivatives are
derived that always exhibit numerical instability in a ﬁxed range of directions; hence, if the ﬁlter
widths are unsuitably large, the ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations can in certain cases be uncon-
ditionally unstable even though there is no error in modeling the subﬁlter-scale stress terms. As
is proved by a simple example, the essence of the present discussion can be applied to any other
smooth ﬁlters; that is, such a numerical instability problem can arise whenever the dependent
variables are smoothed out by a ﬁlter.

INTRODUCTION

Large eddy simulation (LES) [1, 2] is one of the typical numerical approaches to tur-
bulent ﬂows, in which large-scale structures in ﬂuid motion are solved directly while the
eﬀects of the small-scale eddies are modeled based on a ﬁltering operation that separates
the high- and low-wavenumber modes in turbulent ﬂow ﬁelds. Because LES enables us to
treat time-dependent, high-Reynolds-number turbulence with substantially smaller compu-
tational eﬀort and storage than direct numerical simulation (DNS) resolving all scales of
motion, it has been used in many applications in a variety of research ﬁelds, including ﬂuid
machinery [3], combustion engineering [4, 5], atmospheric science [6, 7], geophysics [8, 9, 10],
and astrophysics [11, 12].

For the past few years, however, several reports have been published that point out the
In those repots it has been implied that even
incompleteness of current LES modeling.
a completely accurate LES model could be numerically unstable.
In Ref. [13], Leonard
showed that the tensor-diﬀusivity model, re-derived by truncating an exact expansion series
of subﬁlter-scale forces [14, 15, 16], works as a negative-diﬀusion term in the stretching
directions of ﬂuid motion and hence, that it could lead to numerical instability when used
for ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes. Since that model is exact for ﬁrst-order velocity ﬁelds where the
velocity components can be described by linear polynomials, the model’s negative diﬀusivity
can be considered to exhibit the nature of the exact model under a particular condition.
Also, Winckelmans et al.
[17] and Kobayashi and Shimomura [18, 19, 20] pointed out
that the tensor-diﬀusivity model behaves unstably in a plane channel ﬂow, also due to the
model’s negative diﬀusivity. In a comparative study of LES models (the tensor-diﬀusivity
and rational LES models) [21], Iliescu et al. showed that the tensor-diﬀusivity model can
be unstable in a high-Reynolds-number driven cavity ﬂow, as well. In Ref. [22], Ida and
Taniguchi derived a closed form of the Gaussian-ﬁltered Navier-Stokes (GFNS) equations
under a simple assumption about the instantaneous velocity proﬁle and showed theoretically
that the shears in time-averaged ﬂow ﬁelds can also be the seed of the numerical instability
of the ﬁltered system, because a cross derivative of the ﬁltered velocity component, being
unconditionally unstable in numerical simulation, appears in the closed formula. The authors
stressed that the unstable portions in the closed formula must be solved accurately without
using artiﬁcial techniques (e.g., clipping or damping), since those portions derive naturally
from the ﬁltering operation and are thus a part of the governing equations for LES. In the
sequel to that paper [23], Ida and Taniguchi further ascertained that the shears in the time-
averaged ﬁelds can, through the ﬁltering operation, cause the appearance of a numerically
unstable term that always exhibits a negative diﬀusivity in a ﬁxed direction, a conclusion
that is able to explain the problematic instability that has frequently been confronted in
wall-bounded turbulent ﬂow computations (e.g., Ref. [17, 18]), where a strong shear appears
in the time-averaged streamwise velocity. The theoretical and numerical ﬁndings listed above
appear to suggest that the ﬁltering operation itself is the underlying cause of the numerical
instability in LES, raising the question whether a numerically stable LES model can be
ideally accurate or not.

A similar scenario can be found in simulation strategies for collisionless plasma kinetics
that use the Vlasov-Poisson or Vlasov-Maxwell system as a governing equation. In Refs. [24,
25], Klimas has attempted to apply a Gaussian ﬁlter to the Vlasov equations in order to
mollify the ﬁlamentation of the distribution function (an inﬁnitely ﬁne structure in the
phase space), and found that the ﬁltered Vlasov equations can be rewritten into a closed

2

form in terms of the ﬁltered distribution function and are thus solvable without any empirical
modeling. (We note here that in Klimas’s study the ﬁltering operation was only applied in
the velocity space, which allows for relatively easy derivation of closed formulas and results
in only a few additional terms.) In that closed formula, a cross derivative of the ﬁltered
distribution function appears, which, as Figua et al. suggested [26] (see also Refs. [18, 22]),
makes the ﬁltered system ill-conditioned and unsuitable for numerical simulations using ﬁnite
diﬀerence methods or others excluding the spectral method. As with the Navier-Stokes cases
mentioned above, that ﬁnding implies that the Gaussian ﬁltering operation itself, and not
the modeling or approximations, destabilizes the governing equations.

The present paper extends the numerical stability analysis of the GFNS equations per-
formed by Ida and Taniguchi [23] to construct a generalized theory for the numerical insta-
bility of the system. The present discussion assumes that the ﬂow ﬁelds are, as in Ref. [23],
in a statistically steady state (an assumption allowing us to decompose the velocity compo-
nents into time-independent mean and time-dependent ﬂuctuation portions), but the mean
velocities may be described by high-order polynomials in terms of the spatial coordinates,
while in Ref. [23] ﬁrst-order velocity ﬁelds have mainly been considered. Under these as-
sumptions and using the exact expansion series or integration by parts, we rewrite the terms
that represent the interaction between the mean and ﬂuctuation portions (referred to below
as “mean-ﬂuctuation terms”), ﬁltered by a Gaussian function, into closed forms involv-
ing high-order cross derivatives, and show that through Gaussian ﬁltering, various kinds
of unconditionally unstable terms having time-independent coeﬃcients are derived which
numerically destabilize the modes in a ﬁxed range of directions. Also, detailed stability
analyses of the resulting closed formulas are presented to derive a stability criterion for the
choice of ﬁlter widths. In the present paper, for simplicity we only discuss cases in which the
mean velocity ﬁeld has one-dimensional (1D) or two-dimensional (2D) structures. Moreover,
we are not concerned with the commutation error between diﬀerentiation and ﬁltering (see
e.g. Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30] for recent eﬀorts to resolve the commutation error), assuming
each ﬁlter width to be constant in the corresponding spatial direction. This treatment war-
rants that the numerically unstable terms that we discuss are not those originating from the
commutation error, which is a modeling failure.

The present theoretical investigation has been performed assuming the use of ﬁnite dif-
ference schemes. However, most of the results will be true for other numerical methods (e.g.,
ﬁnite volume, ﬁnite element, compact diﬀerencing) as well. Also, in order to accomplish the
theoretical investigation without the aid of numerical analysis, the present study neglects
the cutoﬀ of high-wavenumber modes originating from the use of ﬁnite grid spacing. The
Gaussian ﬁlter considered in the present study is, therefore, assumed to approximately rep-
resent the numerical damping of high-wavenumber modes due to numerical viscosity (also
originating from the use of ﬁnite grid spacing), and also to be an explicit ﬁlter applied in-
dependently of numerical discretization [17, 31]. Because of these assumptions, we use the
term “subﬁlter scale” in stead of “subgrid scale” throughout this paper.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the governing equations and deﬁni-
tions useful for the present investigation are introduced. In Sec. III, the numerical stability
of arbitrary-order partial diﬀerential equations involving high-order cross derivatives is the-
oretically discussed to derive a stability criterion for them, which is essential for our study.
Combining the result of this stability analysis with an exact expansion series or integration
by parts allows us to construct a generalized theory for the ﬁltering instability under sta-
tistically steady-state conditions. In Sec. IV, several speciﬁc examples are investigated to

3

elucidate how the stability criterion restricts the choice of ﬁlter widths, and in Sec. V, to
elucidate a fundamental mechanism of the numerically unstable terms and to show that the
essential part of the present results is true for non-Gaussian smooth ﬁlters as well, a simple
advection problem is considered where the true solution has a discontinuous step. Section
VI presents notes on remaining issues that must be resolved to gain a more generalized the-
ory. As stated in that section, the present theory has several limitations in its applicability.
We conceive of the present theory as an intermediate step towards a complete theory of
the numerical instability of the GFNS equations. Section VII summarizes this paper, and
the appendix presents a mathematical proof of the exact expansion series using elementary
mathematics, thereby assuring the self-consistency of the present paper.

p is the pressure divided by the constant ﬂuid density, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. The
subﬁlter-scale terms, resulting from a low-pass ﬁltering operation, are derived from the
convection terms (i.e., the second term of Eq. (1)). In what follows, we assume that the
velocity components can be decomposed into time-averaged and ﬂuctuation portions as

where u = (u1, u2, u3), U = (U1, U2, U3), and u′ = (u′
3). We also assume that the
mean velocity U is time-independent; i.e., that the ﬂow is in a statistically steady state.
From Eqs. (2) and (3), one can derive

the stability analysis of which is diﬃcult to complete theoretically and thus requires nu-
merical experiments. Although it has been pointed out that terms having the same form as
R123[u′
i/∂xj] can instantaneously be numerically unstable [13, 22], such terms should not
necessarily lead to numerical instability in actual computation, because their time-averaged
nature can be dissipative. In what follows, we only consider the numerical stability of

on potential approaches to resolving this incompleteness are given in Sec. V. As shown in
what follows, the closed form of Eq. (12) has time-independent coeﬃcients, meaning that
the numerical stability of this portion is time-independent.

We introduce here some mathematical tools that allow us to rewrite the ﬁltered mean-
R123 [hi] into a closed form. Yeo [14] and others [13, 15, 16] have derived

The expansion series (13) and (14) enable us to derive a closed form of Eq. (12). As can
be seen from these series, the closed form has high-order derivatives including high-order
cross derivatives, and the coeﬃcients of these derivatives are time-independent, such as Uj
and ∂Ui/∂xj in hi. The numerical stability of such high-order derivatives are examined
below.

III. NUMERICAL STABILITY OF ARBITRARY-ORDER PARTIAL DIFFEREN-
TIAL EQUATIONS

We derive and examine in this section a numerical-stability criterion to determine whether
an arbitrary-order partial diﬀerential equation (PDE) can be solved stably (and accurately)
by a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme. Although the numerical stability of PDEs is known to depend
on the discretization scheme applied, we do not discuss a certain form of ﬁnite diﬀerencing.
We instead consider the exact ampliﬁcation factor of the PDEs, which is essential and may be
suﬃcient for our aim. It is well known that a diﬀusion equation, for example, is numerically
stable (numerically unstable) when the coeﬃcient of the diﬀusion term is positive (negative),
i.e., when the exact ampliﬁcation factor is less than (greater than) unity. We assume here
that such is also the case for other types of PDEs including high-order ones, and use their
ampliﬁcation factors to judge whether a stable ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme can exist for the
corresponding PDE.

Let us consider the exact solution of a 2D arbitrary-order PDE,

where µ is a real constant and m, n

0 are integers. The initial condition is

where kx and ky are real constants, i is the imaginary unit, and the boundary conditions are
periodic. Suppose that the exact solution of this PDE has the form of

where ω is a complex constant. Substituting this into Eq. (20) yields

The characteristic of this exact solution can roughly be categorized into the following two

solutions:

For m + n = 2M:

whereas the latter represents phase shift without changing amplitude.

Equation (24) suggests that in order for a stable ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme for m + n = 2M

must be zero or less for any value of wavenumbers. Furthermore, if m and n are even
numbers, km
y in this exponent is always positive and the stability is thus determined by
1)M µ. (If, for example, m = 2 and n = 0, which results in M = 1, the PDEs
the sign of (
with µ
0 are numerically stable, while those with µ < 0 are unconditionally unstable,
a conclusion that is consistent with the well-known fact that a positive diﬀusion equation
can be solved stably but a negative one can not.) Otherwise, i.e., if m and n are odd
numbers, km
y can be either positive or negative, meaning that the PDEs in this case are
always unconditionally unstable because modes in any direction can appear in turbulent
ﬂows. (This conclusion is consistent with the known fact that the PDE for m = n = 1 is
1)M µ < 0, for example, the
unconditionally unstable; see, e.g., Refs. [18, 22, 26]). For (
modes of kxky < 0 must be unstable, implying that if the sign of µ is constant, the PDEs
in this case always exhibit numerical instability in a ﬁxed range of directions. This ﬁnding
plays an important role in our main subject discussed in the next section.

On the other hand, Eq. (25) suggests that if m + n is an odd number, a stable ﬁnite

diﬀerence scheme should always exist because the ampliﬁcation exponent

has an imaginary value and hence the absolute value of the ampliﬁcation factor,

of, e.g., m = 1 with n = 0) and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations involving third-
and/or ﬁfth-order dispersion terms (e.g., for m = 1, 3, 5 with n = 0) have been solved stably
and accurately by ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes; see, e.g., Refs. [33, 34, 35] for recent progress in
ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes for KdV equations.

|

The present theoretical results can be summarized as follows: A stable ﬁnite diﬀerence
solver must exist for odd-order PDEs (i.e., when m + n is an odd number). For even-order
1)(m+n)/2µ is neg-
PDEs, a stable solver exists only if both m and n are even numbers and (
ative; otherwise, the PDE is unconditionally unstable by any ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme, since
the numerical perturbations grow exponentially in numerical simulations. This conclusion
may also be true for the ﬁnite volume, ﬁnite element, and compact diﬀerence schemes.

IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS OF THE FILTERED SYSTEM

We present several analytical results for the numerical stability of a ﬁltered system deter-
mined by combining the stability analysis described in the previous section with the exact
expansion series (13) and (14) or the identity given using integration by parts, (15). As
stated in Sec. II, we consider up to 2D cases for the sake of simplicity, and only analyze the
stability of Eq. (12).

A. 1D mean velocity cases

Suppose that

(this means that the velocity satisﬁes the divergence-free condition), which leads to

U1 = U1(x2)

and U2 = U3 = 0,

Because U1 depends only on x2, ﬁltering in the x1 and x3 directions (i.e., in the homogeneous
directions) results in

R13[hi] = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3,
When the Gaussian ﬁlter in the x2 direction is applied to Eqs. (30)-(32), some mathemat-
ical manipulations are needed to obtain a closed formula because U1 and ∂U1/∂x2 cannot
simply be put outside the convolution operation. We consider here the case where U1 is
described by a ﬁnite-order polynomial:

(33)

where an (n = 0, 1, . . . , N) are real constants and N is the order of this polynomial. Using
the 1D expansion series (13), we have

Based on the stability analysis described in Sec. III, it is found that for larger N, all of the
even-order diﬀerential operators in Eq. (38) are unstable, whereas the odd-order ones have
no inﬂuence on the numerical stability. That is, the high-order terms do not help stability.
This result suggests that in most cases of 1D shear, the subﬁlter-scale stress terms would
be unstable, thus leading to a divergence of numerical solution, if an unsuitably large ﬁlter
width is used.

B. 2D mean velocity cases

Next, we consider 2D problems. Suppose that

U1 = U1(x1, x2), U2 = U2(x1, x2),

and U3 = 0,

for theoretical analysis, and hence we only consider some simple cases.

reduce Eqs. (59)-(61) to

This acts as negative diﬀusion in the x1 direction (i.e., in the stretching direction) but
as positive diﬀusion in the x2 direction, a result that is consistent with Leonard’s ﬁnding
shown in the studies on tensor-diﬀusivity models [13, 16]. The ampliﬁcation exponent of

Equation (71) indicates that a smaller ﬁlter width is needed for stronger stretching, and the
largest ﬁlter width usable in the stretching direction is inversely proportional to the square
root of the velocity gradient.

The next example is complicated; not only the normal stresses but also a shear stress

appear in the mean ﬁeld. Suppose that U1 is described locally by

which involves both normal and shear stresses. Then one has, from the divergence-free
condition,

U1(x1, x2) = bx1x2,

as in the previous example; see Fig. 1 showing the vector plot of this velocity ﬁeld around
the origin (x1, x2) = (0, 0). The upper side (x2 ≥
0) of this ﬁgure seems to represent a ﬂow
impinging on the wall located at x2 = 0. Substituting Eqs. (72) and (73), Eqs. (59)-(61)

Among the stability conditions, Eq. (91) gives the weakest restriction on the ﬁlter width; the
second-to-last term of Eq. (94), being a positive diﬀusion term resulting from compression
in the x2 direction, mitigates the instability of the last term, the cross derivative resulting
from the shear in the same direction. In contrast, Eq. (92) is the most restrictive condition,
resulting from the coexistence of a negative-diﬀusion term and a cross derivative term.

In this case, Eqs. (97) and (98), whose respective inﬂuential derivatives have both negative-
diﬀusion and cross-derivative terms, give restrictions of almost equal strength, while Eq. (96),
involving positive-diﬀusion terms only, imposes no restriction. The results provided here
denote that the numerical stability of the ﬁltered system and the possible choice of ﬁlter
widths depend on how the ﬁltering operations are applied; this conclusion conﬁrms the same
assertion presented in Ref. [23].

V. DISCUSSION OF THE NEGATIVE-DIFFUSION TERM

on the negative-diﬀusion term appearing in the stretching direction to clarify why such
unstable terms appear and how the terms work. The discussion also clariﬁes that the
present suggestions are basically true even for other smooth ﬁlters.

In Ref. [13], Leonard considered the pure advection of a sinusoidal wave in a stretching
velocity ﬁeld where the amplitude of the (unﬁltered) sinusoidal wave remains constant,
and provided an interpretation of the negative diﬀusivity of the tensor-diﬀusivity model as
follows: As a sinusoidal wave propagates into a stretching velocity ﬁeld, its wavenumber
gradually decreases, resulting in the increase of the Gaussian-ﬁltered value of the amplitude
because of the larger value of the Gaussian ﬁlter function for a lower wavenumber. The
negative-diﬀusion term represents this ampliﬁcation of the ﬁltered value resulting from the
wavenumber shift. We introduce here a diﬀerent interpretation of the negative diﬀusivity,
using Fig. 2. Let us consider the 1D pure advection of a step function,

f (x, t = 0) =

for x < x0,
otherwise,

1
0

(cid:26)

16

in a stretching velocity ﬁeld u = ax, where x0 (> 0) is the initial position of the discontinuity
in the step function and a is a positive constant. The exact solution of ∂f /∂t + u∂f /∂x = 0
under this condition is

f (x, t) =

1
0

(cid:26)

for x < x0 exp(at),
otherwise,

which indicates that the discontinuous step will change its position without changing its
height and proﬁle; that is, the wavenumber shift does not occur in the unﬁltered true
solution of the present example. Applying the Gaussian ﬁlter to this solution smoothes out
the discontinuity to yield a molliﬁed step whose characteristic width is about 2∆, where ∆
is the characteristic length of the applied Gaussian ﬁlter. Obviously the characteristic width
of the molliﬁed step is time-independent if ∆ is constant. If, however, the pure advection
equation in terms of the ﬁltered value, ∂ ¯f /∂t + u∂ ¯f /∂x = 0, is used to advance the ﬁltered
proﬁle (corresponding to the case where the residual stress term is clipped), the width of the
molliﬁed step, unlike that in the true solution, increases gradually as time goes by due to the
stretching velocity ﬁeld where a downstream ﬂuid particle moves faster than an upstream
particle. To counteract this artiﬁcial expansion of the molliﬁed step, a modiﬁcation by
negative, not positive, diﬀusion is necessary, which sharpens ¯f. In the case of a compression
velocity ﬁeld, a similar but opposite treatment, i.e., the addition of a positive diﬀusion
term, is needed because an artiﬁcial compression of the molliﬁed step arises if only the pure
advection equation is assumed.

The present physical picture may allow us to conclude that the subﬁlter-scale terms
should have an analogous negative diﬀusivity also for any other ﬁlter functions that smooth
the proﬁle of dependent variables. In the above discussion, there is no reason that the ﬁlter
shape must be Gaussian. The artiﬁcial expansion of the step discussed above must occur
whenever the step is smoothed out by a smooth ﬁlter but the pure advection equation is
solved. The above discussion also suggests that a numerically unstable term can appear by
ﬁltering even if the true solution (both ﬁltered and unﬁltered) is physically bounded.

VI. TOWARDS A FURTHER GENERALIZATION

The present theory has several limitations in its applicability resulting from the assump-
tions and simpliﬁcations made. In this section we remark on some signiﬁcant issues that
must be resolved for further generalization.

To construct a more general theory for the numerical stability of the GFNS equations in
statistically steady states, one has to elucidate the numerical stability of, not only Eq. (28),
but also

∂fi
∂t

=

L[ij]fj

for i = 1, 2, 3,

(99)

where
coeﬃcients, determined by the expansion series, and in general

L[ij] (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are inﬁnite sums of diﬀerential operators with position-dependent

L[ab]L[cd] 6

L[cd]L[ab]

=

for (a, b)

= (c, d);

that is, these operators do not commute with each other. Equation (99) represents a com-
plicated coupling between the equations of diﬀerent velocity components.
In the present
study, having assumed 1D or 2D mean velocity ﬁelds, some of the mean-ﬂuctuation terms
were uncoupled as Eqs. (31), (32), (61), and (76), and hence the determined stability con-
ditions are accurate only for the corresponding uncoupled portions. In fully 3D cases where

17

6
high-order velocity ﬁelds must be assumed, however, we may well have to treat the fully
coupled system (99).

j∂u′

R123[u′

The strongest assumption among those made in this paper may be the omission of the
i/∂xj] in Eq. (11). We could not take into consideration
nonlinear ﬂuctuation term
the eﬀects of this term since the theoretical investigation of it is quite diﬃcult to perform
accurately, and the present theory is thus only valid when the ﬂuctuation is small. Terms
of this type, as is well known, have a dissipative character in many turbulent ﬂows, and
hence when the dissipation of the omitted term is strong enough, the instability of the
mean-ﬂuctuation terms can be eliminated completely. One possible way to gain detailed
knowledge of the nonlinear term is an a priori test using DNS, which enables us to determine
the values of all terms in the GFNS equations. Observing and examining the numerically
determined terms should allow us to obtain a more accurate prediction of the numerical
instability. When, for example, the absolute value of the nonlinear term (plus the molecular
viscosity) is smaller than that of the sum of the unstable terms, the instability can not be
eliminated irrespective of the speciﬁc characteristic of the nonlinear term. Also, comparing
the amounts of the energy dissipations due to the unstable terms and the nonlinear terms
should provide a useful insight. This issue will be addressed in a future paper.

Lastly, we make a brief comment on cases with a nonuniform ﬁlter width. Consider
again pure advection of a step function being smoothed by a smooth ﬁlter. When the ﬁlter
width is spatially nonuniform, in the advection process the width of the molliﬁed step varies
according to its position even for a constant velocity, and hence a negative diﬀusion must
take place at least in the period where the width decreases. Such an eﬀect of nonuniform
ﬁltering must be discussed carefully in the near future.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have presented a generalized theory for the numerical instability of the Gaussian-
ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations. The theory allows for high-order mean velocity ﬁelds and
high-order derivatives resulting from the Gaussian ﬁltering operation. Also, we have de-
scribed stability conditions regarding the choice of the ﬁlter widths in several situations, the
violation of which should lead to unconditional numerical instability of the ﬁltered system
even when a completely accurate subﬁlter-scale model exists and is used. It is worth noting
again that the closed formulas of the ﬁltered mean-ﬂuctuation terms determined under sta-
tistically steady-state conditions involve various kinds of unstable derivatives that, because
their coeﬃcients are time-independent, always exhibit numerical instability in a ﬁxed range
of directions. As has been proven by a simple example, the essential part of the present
results can be true even if a non-Gaussian smooth ﬁlter is assumed.

We stress that if one skirts this numerical instability problem, the accuracy of the LES
results will plateau. It is hard to imagine that ideally accurate solutions can be achieved by
incorporating an artiﬁcial damping or clipping technique to avoid this numerical diﬃculty,
because when the subﬁlter-scale terms act unstably, the absolute values of their unstable
portions must be greater than that of the molecular and turbulent viscosities, and the
adoption of such artiﬁcial techniques thus corresponds to the disregard of a term whose
dominance is greater than that of a term involved ab initio in the Navier-Stokes equations.
Recently, Moeleker and Leonard [16] have tackled this numerical instability problem and
proposed an approach to potentially resolve it, based on an anisotropic particle method
incorporating a remeshing technique. Their method has provided excellent results for a

18

2D scalar advection-diﬀusion equation with a known velocity ﬁeld. However, the extension
of that approach to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations has to the author’s knowledge not
yet been achieved. Because ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes have been used widely in turbulence
computations, constructing a stable and accurate solver in the ﬁnite diﬀerence framework
would be preferable, though it will be an exceedingly diﬃcult task and might even be an
unsolvable problem, such as the gravitational three-body problem and the algebraic solution
of general ﬁfth-order polynomial equations of one variable. We do not know so far whether
this instability problem is resolvable or not, but we can say that this problem is not something
that can be avoided when an accurate solution is desired.

APPENDIX: ALTERNATIVE DERIVATION OF THE EXACT EXPANSION SE-

RIES FOR GAUSSIAN FILTERS

The exact expansion series for Gaussian ﬁlters has served as a powerful tool in our study.
We present here a derivation of the series to improve the self-consistency of the present paper.
This derivation seems to be rather intricate and drawn out compared to those by Moeleker
and Leonard [16] and by Carati et al. [15], but it only consists of elementary mathematics:
the Taylor expansion, integration by parts, and some simple algebraic operations. Some
readers may prefer the present derivation.

Let a(x), b(x), f (x), and g(x) be arbitrary, diﬀerentiable and continuous functions of x.
For the Gaussian ﬁlter with γ = 1/2 and the characteristic width of ∆, the exact expansion
series in 1D reads

(ab) =

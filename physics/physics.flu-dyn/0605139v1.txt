Abstract

A theoretical study is presented of the eﬀect of a radially converging melt ﬂow, which
is directed away from the solidiﬁcation front, on the radial solute segregation in
simple solidiﬁcation models. We show that the classical Burton-Prim-Slichter (BPS)
solution describing the eﬀect of a diverging ﬂow on the solute incorporation into
the solidifying material breaks down for the ﬂows converging along the solidiﬁcation
front. The breakdown is caused by a divergence of the integral deﬁning the eﬀective
boundary layer thickness which is the basic concept of the BPS theory. Although
such a divergence can formally be avoided by restricting the axial extension of the
melt to a layer of ﬁnite height, radially uniform solute distributions are possible
only for weak melt ﬂows with an axial velocity away from the solidiﬁcation front
comparable to the growth rate. There is a critical melt velocity for each growth
rate at which the solution passes through a singularity and becomes physically
inconsistent for stronger melt ﬂows. To resolve these inconsistencies we consider
a solidiﬁcation front presented by a disk of ﬁnite radius R0 subject to a strong
converging melt ﬂow and obtain an analytic solution showing that the radial solute
concentration depends on the radius r as
ln(R0/r) close to
the rim and at large distances from it. The logarithmic increase of concentration is
limited in the vicinity of the symmetry axis by the diﬀusion becoming eﬀective at
a distance comparable to the characteristic thickness of the solute boundary layer.
The converging ﬂow causes a solute pile-up forming a logarithmic concentration
peak at the symmetry axis which might be an undesirable feature for crystal growth
processes.

1 Introduction

Solidiﬁcation and crystallisation processes are present in various natural phe-
nomena as well as in a large number of material production technologies such
as, for example, semiconductor crystal growth from the melt, alloy metallurgy,
etc. Usually the melt used for the production of solid material is not a pure sub-
stance but rather a solution containing some dissolved dopants or impurities.
Often the solid material grown from the solution has a non-uniform distri-
bution of the dissolved substance although the original solution was uniform.
This non-uniformity is caused by the diﬀerence of equilibrium concentrations
of solute in the liquid and solid phases. Thus, if the equilibrium concentration
of solute in a crystal is lower than in the melt, only a fraction of solute is
incorporated from the melt into the growing crystal while the remaining part
is repelled by the solidiﬁcation front as it advances into the liquid phase [1].
This eﬀect causes axial segregation of the solute, usually concentrated in a
thin, diﬀusion-controlled boundary layer adjacent to the solidiﬁcation front.
Axial segregation can strongly be inﬂuenced by the melt convection. Accord-
ing to the original work by Burton, Prim and Slichter (BPS) [2], a suﬃciently
strong convection towards the crystallisation front reduces the thickness of
the segregation boundary layer and so the solute concentration getting into
the crystal. Such a concept of solute boundary layer has been widely accepted
to interpret the eﬀect of melt ﬂow on the solute distribution in various crys-
tal growth conﬁgurations [3,4,5]. The BPS approach, originally devised for
a rotating-disk ﬂow modelling an idealised Czochralski growth conﬁguration,
supposes the melt to be driven towards the solidiﬁcation front by a radially
diverging ﬂow. However, in many cases, as for instance in a ﬂow rotating over
a disk at rest [6], like in a ﬂow driven by a rotating [7] or a travelling [8] mag-
netic ﬁeld, as well as in the natural convection above a concave solidiﬁcation
front in the vertical Bridgman growth process [9], the melt is driven away
from the solidiﬁcation front in its central part by a radially converging ﬂow.
Though several extensions of the BPS solution exist (e.g. [10,11,12,13]), the
possibility of a reversed ﬂow direction away from the crystallisation front has
not yet been considered in that context.

In this work, we show that the BPS approach becomes invalid for converging
ﬂows because the eﬀective boundary layer thickness, which is the basic concept
of the BPS theory, is deﬁned by an integral diverging for a ﬂow away from the
solidiﬁcation front. The divergence can formally be avoided by restricting the
space occupied by the melt above the solidiﬁcation front to a layer of ﬁnite
depth, but for higher melt velocities this solution becomes physically incon-

sistent, too. Next we consider a solidiﬁcation front as a disk of ﬁnite radius
immersed in the melt with a strong converging ﬂow and show that a converging
ﬂow results in a logarithmic solute segregation along the solidiﬁcation front
with a peak at the symmetry axis. An analytical solution is obtained by an
original technique using a Laplace transform. The advantage of this solution is
its simple analytical form as well as the high accuracy which has been veriﬁed
by comparing with numerical solutions.

The simulation of dopant transport is an important aspect of crystal growth
modelling [14,15], and various numerical approaches are used for it. However,
a numerical approach is always limited in the sense that it provides only
particular solutions while the basic relations may remain hidden. Besides,
the numerical solution often requires considerable computer resources when
a high spatial resolution is necessary which is particularly the case for thin
solute boundary layers. It has been shown, e.g., by Vartak and Derby [16] that
an insuﬃcient resolution of the solute boundary layer may lead to numerically
converged but nevertheless inaccurate results.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the BPS-type ap-
proach and show its inapplicability to converging ﬂows. The simple model
problem of radial segregation along a disk of ﬁnite radius in a strong converg-
ing ﬂow is described in Section 3, and an analytical solution for the concen-
tration distribution on the disk surface is obtained in Section 4. Summary and
conclusions are presented in Section 5.

2 Breakdown of BPS-type solutions

∞

Consider a simple solidiﬁcation model consisting of a ﬂat radially-unbounded
solidiﬁcation front advancing at velocity v0 into a half-space occupied by the
melt which is a dilute solution characterised by the solute concentration C.
The latter is assumed to be uniform and equal to C
suﬃciently far away
from the solidiﬁcation front. Solute is transported in the melt by both dif-
fusion with a coeﬃcient D and the melt convection with a velocity ﬁeld v.
At the solidiﬁcation front, supposed to be at the thermodynamic equilibrium,
the ratio of solute concentrations in the solid and liquid phases is given by
the equilibrium partition coeﬃcient k. In the absence of convection, the re-
pelled solute concentrates in a boundary layer with the characteristic thickness
δ0 = D/v0. We consider in the following the usual case of a much larger mo-
mentum boundary layer compared to the solute boundary layer, i.e. a high
Schmidt number Sc = ν/D
1 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the
melt. The basic assumption of the BPS approach is that the lateral segrega-
tion is negligible and thus the solute transport is aﬀected only by the normal
velocity component. The latter is approximated in the solute boundary layer

tually, the concentration at the solidiﬁcation front is obtained as C(0) =

[1
ing that only the eﬀective thickness of the solute boundary layer deﬁned by
the local velocity proﬁle is necessary to ﬁnd the solute concentration at the
solidiﬁcation front for a given uniform concentration in the bulk of the melt.
However, it is important to note that this solution is limited to Pe
0 and
it becomes invalid for Pe < 0 when the ﬂow is directed away from the so-
lidiﬁcation front because both integrals in Eq. (3) and ∆(Pe) diverge in this
case. The goal of this study is to ﬁnd out what happens to the solute distribu-
tion when the ﬂow is directed away from the solidiﬁcation front and the BPS
solution breaks down.

≥

The divergence in the BPS model for Pe < 0 is obviously related to the un-
bounded interval of integration which can be avoided by taking into account
the ﬁnite axial size of the system. The simplest such model, shown in Fig. 1,
is provided by a ﬂat, radially-unbounded layer between two disks separated
by a distance 2H. The upper and lower disks represent the melting and so-
lidiﬁcation fronts, respectively, and the molten zone proceeds upwards with
velocity v0. There is a forced convection in the melt with the axial velocity v(z)
which is assumed to satisfy impermeability and no-slip boundary conditions.

Note that this boundary condition following from the mass conservation does
not formally satisfy the local thermodynamic equilibrium relating the solute
concentrations in the solid and liquid phases. In order to ensure equilibrium
concentrations at the melting front it would be necessary to take into account
also the diﬀusion in the solid phase which, however, is neglected here. Such
an approximation is justiﬁed by the smallness of the corresponding diﬀusion
coeﬃcient.

Although the eﬀective boundary layer thickness is now bounded for any ﬁnite
value of Pe 1 regardless of its sign deﬁning the ﬂow direction, the obtained solu-
tion is not really free from singularities. At ﬁrst, note that the concentration at
the solid-liquid interface becomes singular when the solute boundary layer be-
1 resulting in a zero denominator
comes as thick as Pe 0∆(Pe 0, Pe 1) = (1

in Eq. (7). Second, for larger Pe 1 the denominator in Eq. (7) becomes negative
implying a negative concentration at the solidiﬁcation front that presents an
obvious physical inconsistency. Thus, the obtained solution is applicable only
for suﬃciently weak converging ﬂows and breaks down as the velocity of the
melt ﬂow away from the solidiﬁcation front becomes comparable to the growth
rate at Pe 1 ∼

Pe 0.

3 A disk of ﬁnite radius with a strong converging ﬂow

The assumption underlying both the classical BPS approach and that of the
previous section is the neglected radial segregation. The simplest physical
model which could account for radial segregation is presented by a solidiﬁca-
tion front in the form of a disk of ﬁnite radius R0 with the melt occupying the
half-space above it, as shown in Fig. 3. For simplicity, the velocity distribution
in the melt is assumed to be that of a liquid rotating above a disk at rest. In
this case, contrary to the classical BPS problem of a rotating disk, the ﬂow is
radially converging rather than diverging. Thus, within the solute boundary
layer, assumed as usual to be thin relative to the momentum boundary layer,
the radial and axial velocity components can be approximated as

Here we choose the thickness of the solute boundary layer based on the axial
melt velocity as length scale

d0 = (2D/v′′z (0))1/3,

and assume the stirring of the melt to be so strong that the advancement of the
solidiﬁcation front with the growth velocity v0 is small compared the character-
istic melt ﬂow in the solute boundary layer. The last assumption implies that
the local P´eclet number based on the growth rate is small: ˜Pe 0 = v0d0/D
1.
Then the problem is deﬁned by a single dimensionless parameter, the dimen-
1/3, which may be regarded as

in Eq. (10) which, compared to the original BPS Eq. (1), has an extra term
related to the radial advection whereas both the term of axial advection due
to the solidiﬁcation speed and the radial diﬀusion term have been neglected.
Note that on one hand the radial advection term is indeed important because
without it we recover the BPS case which was shown above to have no bounded
solution. On the other hand, for the radial advection term to be signiﬁcant
the solute distribution has to be radially nonuniform. However, searching for a
self-similar solution in the form C1(r, z) = rαF (zrβ) leads only to the radially
uniform solution with α = β = 0. This implies that a possible solution has
to incorporate the radial length scale R. Additional diﬃculties with ﬁnding
similarity solutions are caused by the explicit appearance of r in Eq. (10).
Both these facts suggest the substitution τ =

Note that the solution (17) describing the solute concentration increasing along
ln(R/r) is not applicable at the symmetry axis r =
the solidiﬁcation front as
0 where it becomes singular. This apparent singularity is due to the neglected
radial diﬀusion term in Eq. (10) which, obviously, becomes signiﬁcant in the
vicinity of the symmetry axis at distances comparable to the characteristic
thickness of the solute boundary layer (9) that corresponds to a dimensionless
1. The radial diﬀusion becoming eﬀective at r . 1 is expected to

5 Summary and conclusions

We have analysed the eﬀect of a converging melt ﬂow, which is directed away
from the solidiﬁcation front, on the solute distribution in several simple solid-
iﬁcation models. First, it was shown that the classical Burton-Prim-Slichter
solution based on the local boundary layer approach is not applicable for such
ﬂows because of the divergence of the integral deﬁning the eﬀective thickness
of the solute boundary layer. Second, in order to avoid this divergence we con-
sidered the model of a ﬂat, radially-unbounded layer of melt conﬁned between
two disks representing melting and solidiﬁcation fronts. This resulted in a ra-
dially uniform solute distribution which, however, breaks down as the velocity
of the melt ﬂow away from the solidiﬁcation front becomes comparable to
the growth rate. This suggested that a suﬃciently strong radially converging
melt ﬂow is incompatible with a radially uniform concentration distribution
and, consequently, radial solute segregation is unavoidable in such ﬂows. Thus,
we next analysed the radial solute segregation caused by a strong converging
melt ﬂow over a solidiﬁcation front modeled by a disk of ﬁnite radius R0. We
obtained an analytic solution showing that the radial solute concentration at
ln1/3 (R0/r)
the solidiﬁcation front depends on the cylindrical radius r as

∼

∼

ln (R0/r) close to the rim of the disk and at large distances away from
and
it, respectively. It is important to note that these scalings do not imply any
singularity at the axis r = 0. Instead, the concentration perturbation takes
the value (18) at the mid-point of the ﬁnite radius disk.

It has to be stressed that the radial segregation according to our analysis is by
a factor ln(R0/d0) larger than that suggested by a simple order-of-magnitude
or dimensional analysis (e. g. Eq. (11)). Thus, for converging ﬂows the concen-
tration at the solidiﬁcation front is determined not only by the local velocity
distribution but also by the ratio of internal and external length scales which
appear as a logarithmic correction factor to the result of a corresponding scal-
ing analysis. The main conclusion is that ﬂows converging along the solidiﬁca-
tion front, conversely to the diverging ones, cause a radial solute segregation
with a logarithmic concentration peak at the symmetry axis which might be
an undesirable feature for crystal growth applications.

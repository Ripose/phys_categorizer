Optimizing the semicircular canal: could we balance any better?

The ﬂuid-ﬁlled semicircular canals (SCCs) of the vestibular system are used by all vertebrates
to sense angular rotation. Despite masses spanning seven decades, all mammalian SCCs are nearly
the same size. We propose that the SCC represents a sensory organ that evolution has ‘optimally
designed’. Four geometric parameters are used to characterize the SCC, and ‘building materials’ of
given physical properties are assumed. Identifying physical and physiological constraints on SCC
operation, we ﬁnd that the most sensitive SCC has dimensions consistent with available data.

Simple physical principles and scaling arguments have
been remarkably eﬀective in understanding organismic
and evolutionary properties of the animal kingdom [1].
Sensory organs, which transduce a physical stimulus into
a neural signal, are particularly well-suited for physical
analysis. The auditory system and the cochlea, for ex-
ample, have been the focus of much recent study [2].

Here we focus on a diﬀerent inner-ear organ: the ﬂuid-
ﬁlled semicircular canals (SCCs) used to mechanically
sense rotation [3, 4]. Every one of the roughly 45,000 ver-
tebrate species employs SCCs in order to balance, nav-
igate, and hunt [5, 6]. Rotation sensation is obviously
imperative for balance; its role is perhaps equally impor-
tant, however, for vision. The neural output of the SCCs
feeds directly to the oculomotor system, causing a reﬂex-
ive motion of the eyes (nystagmus) that compensates for
the head motion sensed by the vestibular system [3]. Nys-
tagmus allows you to read this article even while shaking
your head. This task would be much more diﬃcult (or
even impossible) if the article itself were shaken.

Previously, we studied ‘top-shelf vertigo’, a mechani-
cal disorder of the human SCC [7]. Here, we address a
rather astonishing feature of the SCCs: the SCCs of every
mammal, from mice to whales, are essentially the same
size (Figure 1) [5, 6]. Mammals span seven decades in
mass, yet SCC dimensions are restricted to less than one
decade. Fish, reptile, amphibian, and bird SCCs have
sizes very similar to mammals as well [5], the one ap-
parent exception being sharks (discussed below) [6]. In
fact, the human SCC reaches its full adult size by the
fourteenth week of pregnancy [8]. Vogel wrote, “...any-
thing biological that doesn’t vary in size ought to strike
us as noteworthy,” and explored physical reasons for the
constancy of cell size [1]. Similarly, these particular SCC
dimensions may be special to their function.

Herein, we propose that the ‘universal’ size of the SCCs
can be understood in terms of a system which has been
‘optimally designed’ by evolution. The idea that biolog-
ical structures are somehow ‘optimal’ has recently found
rather dramatic support. Microcavities in the brittle star
skeleton act as perfect lenses [9], and sea sponges de-
velop single-mode optical ﬁbers that rival current tech-
nology [10]. The human visual system operates at the

FIG. 1: Measured values of R and d for mammals [5, 6].
Despite seven decades of mass variation, variations in R and
d are limited to about one decade. Solid (dashed) horizon-
tal lines reﬂect ‘optimal’ (‘tolerant’) SCC dimensions (13-
14),(16). Rough measurements of c and t for mammals [14]
reveal t ∼ 0.15−0.44 mm and c ∼ 0.17−0.5 mm (c.f. optimal
(tolerant) c = .12(.14), t = .12(.12).)

single-photon level [11], and the auditory system is lim-
ited by thermal noise [12]. While others have examined
the relation between SCC sensitivity and geometry from
a ﬂuid standpoint [5, 6], this work is the ﬁrst to incorpo-
rate cupular elasticity and hair cell transduction, both of
which depend on dimension. We ﬁnd that, given build-
ing materials and subject to physical and physiologically
reasonable constraints, the most sensitive SCC has di-
mensions consistent with measured data.

To address SCC optimality, we ﬁrst describe their ba-
sic structure and function (Fig. 2). Each ear contains
three mutually orthogonal SCCs to span the three axes
of rotation. Each SCC is a hollow torus of major radius
R, consisting of a narrow duct of radius d and a bulbous
ampulla of radius c. All are ﬁlled with ﬂuid endolymph
of density ρ and viscosity µ similar to that of water. The
ampulla (Fig. 2b) contains two structures vital to sen-
sory transduction. The cupula, an elastic membrane of
thickness t and radius c, completely spans the ampulla,
blocking the ﬂow [3]. Along one wall, the cupula is at-
tached to the crista, a ridge lined with sensory hair cells,

FIG. 2: (a) The semicircular canal is a torus of major radius
R, with a long narrow duct of radius d spanning an angle βd
and thicker section spanning βu. (b) The ampulla contains an
elastic cupula of thickness t and radius c, which distorts under
SCC rotation, causing embedded hair cell stereocilia to deﬂect
a distance ζ and trigger a neural signal. (c) SCC operation:
Angular velocity is impulsively accelerated to Ω0 at ta and
the cupula distorts by Vc ∝ Ω0 (i). Under sustained rotation
(ii), the cupula relaxes and ‘forgets’ Ω0. Upon decelerating
to rest at td (iii), ﬂuid inertia causes a (negative) cupular
displacement, eliciting dizziness.

from which stereocilia (of length λH ≈ 50µm [13]) project
into the cupula. Measured values (in mm) for humans are
dh = 0.19, th = 0.31, Rh = 2.8, ch = 0.44 [14].

Basic SCC function is shown in Fig. 2c. An impulsive
angular acceleration α(t) = Ω0δ(t − ta), viewed in the
rest frame of the canal, gives rise to a ballistic motion of
the endolymph, initially at angular velocity Ω0. Viscous
resistance from the walls cuts oﬀ this inertial motion after
a time τf (about 5 ms in humans). During this ballistic
time, a volume Vc ∝ Ω0 of ﬂuid passes through the canal,
distorting the cupula to displace the same volume (Fig.
2c(i)). The cupular distortion deﬂects the stereocilia, and
a corresponding neural signal is ﬁred.

The elastic restoring force of the distorted cupula
drives ﬂuid back through the narrow duct. Viscous resis-
tance from duct walls slows cupular relaxation to a time
scale τs (4-7 s in humans and primates [15, 16]), so that Vc
encodes angular velocity Ω for t <
∼ τs. Under sustained
rotation, however, the cupula relaxes (Fig. 2c(ii)) and
‘forgets’ the constant rotation rate Ω0. Upon stopping,
the sudden deceleration leads to a cupular displacement
in the opposite direction (Fig. 2c(iii)), causing dizziness
(the false sensation of rotation). The shorter τs, the more
quickly an organism becomes dizzy.

Simple scaling arguments give relations for SCC pro-
cesses. Fluid ‘knows’ that walls are accelerating only

after vorticity created at the walls diﬀuses to the duct
center, giving an inertial time τf ∼ d2/ν. During τf ,
ﬂuid moves ballistically with velocity Ω0R, so that a
ﬂuid volume V ∼ (πd2)Ω0Rτf travels through the duct.
Once inertia is cut oﬀ, the cupula relaxes quasistatically,
with an elastic restoring pressure ∆P = KVc that drives
a Poiseuille ﬂow with volume ﬂux ˙Vc. Assuming vis-
cous resistance to be dominated in the narrow duct gives
∆P ∼ µβdR ˙Vc/d4. A pressure balance gives an ODE for
Vc, whose solution decays exponentially on a time scale
τs ∼ µβdR/Kd4.

Complete formulae for SCC dynamics follow from Van
Buskirk et al.
[17], who solved for the time-dependent
laminar ﬂow of endolymph due to an angular acceleration
α = Ω0δ(t) of the canal walls. The maximum cupular
displacement was found to be

To understand cupular deformations, we treat the
cupula as a clamped elastic plate of Young’s modulus
E0 = E′(1 − σ2) and Poisson ratio σ, as in [18]. Cupular
displacements w are small relative to the cupular thick-
ness t, so we assume bending to dominate stretching. A
plate of bending rigidity D0 = E′t3/12 under an applied
pressure P obeys D0∇4w = P , giving a deformed proﬁle
w = wmax[1 − (r/c)2]2, where wmax = P c4/64D0 [19].
Relating ∆Vc to ∆Pc gives an expression for the cupular
stiﬀness constant K,

Using (2) and the measured value of τs (≈ 4 s [15]), we
ﬁnd K = 4.6 GPa/m3, which from (3) implies E′ ≈ 2
dyne/cm2, consistent with measured values for mucus
[20]. Measurements indicate that the neuural signal
varies with stereocilia tip displacement ζ [21], which for
an embedded stereocilium is related to Vc and wmax via

Having characterized the mechanical response, we now
examine the transduction process. Hair cells have a high
resting discharge rate, and are bi-directionally sensitive.
Uniform hair cell orientation takes advantage of this bi-
directionality, allowing rotations in either direction to be
sensed quickly and with increased sensitivity [3]. While
inter- and intra-species hair cell variation certainly exists,
for simplicity we assume all hair cells to have the same

(order of magnitude) properties, which we take from ex-
periments on squirrel monkeys [16]. For small ζ, the
relationship between ﬁring rate and ζ (or Ω) is linear:
∆f ≈ αΩ, where α = 0.24/◦. The ﬁring rate has natural
limits: it can not be negative, and possesses a maximum
(injured) ﬁring rate (∼400 Hz). Saturating deﬂections
ζsat occur for ∆f ∼ fr ≈ 100 Hz, implying a ‘saturating’
rotation Ωsat = fr/α ≈ 420◦/s. Physiological measure-
ments suggest a sensation threshold for Ωmin ≈ 2◦/s [22].
From (1) and (4), the dynamic range of stereocilia deﬂec-
tions is given by

ζmin ≈ 20 nm, ζsat ≈ 4 µm,

We have now characterized the mechanical-neural sig-
nal transduction, and can examine the eﬀect of varying
SCC dimensions. We scale SCC variables by their hu-
man values, denote scaled variables with hats, and pose
the central question: Given ‘blueprints’ (Fig. 2) with-
out dimensions, and given basic building materials (solid
walls, ﬂuid endolymph, elastic material with modulus E′,
and hair cells with λH , ζmin and ζsat), what dimensions
{ ˆR, ˆc, ˆd, ˆt} maximize SCC sensitivity ˆS = ˆd4 ˆR/ˆc4?

Certain constraints, however, must be obeyed for a
physically- and physiologically-viable SCC. First, ther-
mal ﬂuctuations of the cupula must be small enough to
escape detection, or else balance and vision would be im-
paired. The probability of a cupular displacement ﬂuctu-
ation Vc is given by P (Vc) ∼ exp(−KV 2
c /2kBT ). We use
(3) and (4) to express P (Vc) in terms of ζ, giving P (ζ) =
H. The
2
probability of sensing a thermal ﬂuctuation is given by
p
P (ζ > ζmin) = 1 − erf(σ1/2ζmin). Requiring P (ζ > ζmin)
to be smaller than some value ǫ = 10−5 gives

σ/π exp(−σζ2), where σ = πE′c2t3/18kBT λ4

Note that A is rather insensitive to ǫ: A(10−6) = 0.16
and A(10−4) = 0.14.

Second, the cupula should encode angular velocity for
as long as possible. The smaller τs, the sooner angular
velocity is ‘forgotten’ and dizziness ensues. Requiring τs
to be larger than some minimum time τ m

given by the logarithm of (6-12). As in linear program-
ming, extrema are found at vertices of the constraint

that is about 24 times greater than the human SCC. Fig.
1 compares these dimensions with vertebrate data.

While the above analysis assumes perfect ‘machine
tools,’ nature’s machinery has a rather larger tolerance:
variations in human SCC dimension are of order 10%
[23]. To allow for imperfect ‘machining’, we ﬁnd the most
sensitive ‘tolerant’ SCC such that 10% variations in any
dimension satisfy constraints A − F , giving

ˆR = 1.9, ˆc = 0.33, ˆd = 0.46, ˆt = 0.38,
(16)
with a relative sensitivity ˆS ≈ 7. SCC sensitivity varia-
tions due to size variations range from about 0.4 to 2.5
times that of the ‘average’ canal.

A natural question involves the inﬂuence of our spe-
ciﬁc choices of τ m
and Ωmax . From (15), changing
s
τ m
s does not aﬀect the sensitivity; it does, however, af-
fect the resulting dimensions (13-14). Taking the hu-
man value τ m
s = τs = 4 s, the optimal ‘tolerant’ di-
mensions { ˆR, ˆc, ˆd, ˆt} are {3.9, 0.33, 0.38, 0.38}. Doubling
(halving) the maximum rotation Ωmax gives an optimal
tolerant canal that is 3.7 (15) times more sensitive than
the human canal, with dimensions {1.4, 0.33, 0.42, 0.38}
({2.8, 0.33, 0.50, 0.38}).

Lastly, the present theory makes qualitative predic-
tions of SCC trends consistent with the small but sys-
tematic variations among vertebrate SCCs. SCC radius
ˆR increases gently with organism size [5, 6]. Inertia slows
the acceleration of larger organisms, causing less rapid
but more sustained rotations. Requiring a longer τs and
allowing a smaller Ωmax results in an optimal ˆR that in-
creases with (τs/Ωmax)1/2.

No constraint on measurement time τf was introduced,
although it plays an important role in vision:
to be
‘watched’, an image must be kept within one retinal fovea
– about 1◦ in humans [3]. In the time τf following an Ω0
impulse, the eye/fovea lags the image by ∆θ ∼ Ω0τf ,
so that the maximum rotation allowing a ﬁxed gaze is
Ωv ∼ 1◦/τf ∼ 200◦/s. Larger creatures typically undergo
slower rotations, allowing larger τf (and thus d). Further-
more, rapidly-ﬂying birds have smaller ˆd than similarly-
sized earthbound ones [3], which may allow them to hold
objects in view more easily during rapid maneuvers.

Although we have explicitly discussed mammals, the
same SCC dimensions are found in all vertebrates, with
a few notable exceptions. Head size is an obvious and
unavoidable constraint for exceedingly small ﬁsh larvae
[6], whose SCCs start small and grow with the ﬁsh. As
a group, sharks–even small ones–have abnormally large
SCCs (R ∼ 40 mm) [6]. Much smaller (but systematic)
diﬀerences exist between major groups (birds, ﬁsh, etc.)
[5]. One possibility is that the ‘building materials’ (as-
sumed identical here) may vary between groups.

In summary, we have argued that evolution has con-
verged on an ‘optimal’ design for a maximally sensi-
tive rotation detector. The ‘optimum’ SCC is well-
constrained, with little room for variations, and falls

4

within a factor of three of available data. Consequently,
although most organs scale with organism size, the
SCCs are surprisingly constant in dimension for organism
masses spanning many decades.

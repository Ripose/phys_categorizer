In two papers we proposed a continuum model for the dynamics of systems of self propelling
particles with kinematic constraints on the velocities and discussed some of its properties. The
model aims to be analogous to a discrete algorithm used in works by T. Vicsek et al. In this paper
we derive the continuous hydrodynamic model from the discrete description. The similarities and
diﬀerences between the resulting model and the hydrodynamic model postulated in our previous
papers are discussed. The results clarify the assumptions used to obtain a continuous description.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Systems of self propelling particles (SPP) are widely represented in the nature. Flocks of birds, schools of ﬁshes,
swarms of ants, groups of bacteria etc. are examples of such systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. The observed complex behavior of
these systems is far from completely understood. That is why this phenomenon is of great interest. Pattern formation
in the systems of SPP is caused either by the presence of external ﬁelds (e.g. temperature gradient, food density
gradient, chemotaxis phenomenon etc.) or by kinematic constraints which are imposed on the motion of the particles.
In this second case the clustering of SPP is driven by internal dynamics of a nonpotential character. The tendency
of the particles to align their velocities with their neighbors is a crucial element in the mechanism of the emergence
of the coherent motion of the SPP. Numerous attempts have been made to ﬁnd a model describing the collective
behavior of self propelling particles. One may distinguish two main directions of research: the numerical simulations
(discrete description) and the hydrodynamic (continuous) approaches.

The ﬁrst numerical model (discrete algorithm) for coherent motion of SPP was proposed by T. Vicsek et al.
[5].
In their work a simple kinematic updating rule for the directions of the velocities of the particles was proposed
and numerical evidence was given for a transition from a disordered state to ordered collective motion at low noise
amplitude and high density values. They seem to have been the ﬁrst to realize that ﬂocks fall into a broad category
of nonequilibrium dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom and noted the analogy between ﬂocking and
ferromagnetism. The model of T. Vicsek has become the “minimal“ simulation model in the “modern era“ of the
study of ﬂocking. Extensions of T. Vicsek’s model have been proposed considering particles with varying speeds
and diﬀerent types of noise, by inclusion of external force ﬁelds and/or interparticle attractive and repulsive forces
[6, 7, 8, 9].

Properties of T. Vicsek’s model were also investigated from a mathematical point of view. In [10] the spontaneous
emergence of ordered motion has been studied in terms of so called control laws using graph theory. Generalizations
of the control laws were considered in [11, 12]. In [12] it was shown that the organized motion of SPP with the control
laws depending on the relative orientations of the velocities and relative spacing, can be of two types only: parallel
and circular motion. The stability properties of these discrete updating rules (including the T.Vicsek’s model) and
the dynamics they describe were considered using Lyapunov’s theory in [10, 11, 13, 14].

The work by T.Vicsek et al. also gave an impulse to the development of continuous approaches. Here one may

distinguish two classes of approaches.

The ﬁrst class consists of the models which are usually based on the analogy with the Navier-Stokes equation,
where terms describing the self propelling nature of the system are added. In [15] the pressure and viscous terms are
incorporated into the model side by side with the driving force and the friction caused by the interaction with the
environment. The inclusion of additional terms in [16, 17] was done based on symmetry consideration. The attempt
to derive such phenomenological equations from the kinetic equation was made recently in [18].

The second class contains models which describe the swarming behavior of SPP by inclusion of attractive and
repulsive interactions. The model, based on the diﬀusion-advection-reaction equation with nonlocal attractive and
repulsive terms, is suggested in [19] in order to describe the swarming phenomenon. Their model gives a compact (with
sharp edges) aggregation of SPP with a constant density as a result, which according to the authors is biologically
reasonable.

Another continuous model for the behavior of the living organisms with nonlocal social interactions is proposed in
[20]. There the kinematic rule for the velocity ﬁeld contains the density dependent drift and the nonlocal attraction

and repulsion contributions. For a 2-dimensional case of incompressible ﬂuid with the motion of the particles being
normal to the population gradients, the ﬂow of a constant density with a compact support is obtained.

In two papers [21, 22] we proposed a hydrodynamic model, which can be considered to be the continuum analogue
of the discrete dynamic automaton proposed by T. Vicsek et al.
[5], which we further will call the CVA model or
algorithm. We constructed our model on the basis of the physical properties of the discrete CVA model, namely the
conservation of the number of particles and the kinetic energy. The discrete conﬁguration updating rule used by T.
Vicsek et al. changes only the direction of the particle velocities but keeps their absolute value constant. In their
algorithm the number of particles is constant as well.

In this article we obtain the continuous description by coarse graining the discrete CVA algorithm. In this respect
our present paper is meant to be a link between two existing groups of approaches: discrete and continuous. The
importance of this analysis is that it clariﬁes which of the continuous models we proposed is closest to be the continuum
analog of the CVA model.

In Section 2 we will start with a rule for the velocities formulated by T. Vicsek et al. and obtain a discrete equation
of motion for each particle. We introduce angular velocities associated with the rate of change of the direction of the
linear velocity of the particles. These angular velocities contain the information about the nonpotential interactions
between a given particle and its local surrounding. We derive an expression for the angular velocities in the continuous
time description. We show that to a ﬁrst order in the velocity diﬀerence between the steps the angular velocity for
particle i depends on the average velocity in the neighborhood of the ith particle and its rate of change.

In Section 3 we obtain the continuous description, with a conserved kinetic energy and number of particles, using a
coarse-graining procedure. We obtain the angular velocity ﬁeld that follows from the CVA 2-dimensional model and
compare it with the angular velocity ﬁelds we proposed in our ﬁrst paper. It turns out that there are similarities and
diﬀerences. Both the continuous description that follows from the CVA model and our continuous model are and have
been shown to give stationary linear and vortical ﬂow ﬁelds. The description of such ﬂow ﬁelds is one of the aims of
the model. A discussion is given and concluding remarks are made in the last section.

II. CONTINUUM TIME LIMIT

In this section we derive the equation of motion in continuous time from the CVA algorithm. In their work [5] the
collective behavior of self propelling particles with respect to a change of the density and the strength of the noise
was investigated. In our analysis the noise will not be considered. We focus on the systematic contribution. In our
ﬁrst paper we discussed how noise can be added in our approach.

The ordered motion of self propelling particles in [5] is described by the CVA rule, according to which at each
discrete time step (labeled by n) the ith particle adjusts the direction of its velocity vi (n) to the direction of the
average velocity ui (n) in its neighborhood. The average is calculated over a region with a radius R around a given
particle. Using this radius we will call particle densities small compared to R−d, where d is the dimensionality, small.
When the density is larger we call it large. The CVA rule implies that

where the absolute value of the velocity of each particle is assumed to be constant , i.e.

vi (n + 1) × ui (n) = 0,

∀ i, n ,

| vi (n + 1) |=| vi (n) |= vi .

Together with Eq. (1) it follows that

vi (n + 1) = vi ui (n) , where

| ui (n) |= 1 .

Using the fact that vi (n + 1) − vi (n) is perpendicular to vi (n + 1) + vi (n), given the validity of Eq. (2), it can be
shown that

vi (n + 1) − vi (n) = [

vi (n) ×

vi (n + 1)] ×

vi (n + 1) + vi (n)

(cid:20)

1 +

where

vi (n) ≡ vi (n) /vi is a unit vector in the direction of the velocity vi (n).

In
It is important to realize that there is a diﬀerence between low density regions and high density regions.
high density regions the velocity of the particles is updated at every step. In the low density regions the average
of the velocity of particles around and including particle i is equal to the velocity of particle i.
It follows that
ui (n) = vi (n) /vi . As a consequence vi (n + 1) = vi (n). Substitution in Eq. (4) gives the equality zero equal to

2

zero. The important conclusion is that in the low density regions the particles do not change their velocity. We will
come back to this point when this is relevant.

In order to obtain a continuous description as a function of time, we assume the steps to be small so that

|

vi (n + 1) −

vi (n) |≪ 1 .

One may then write Eq. (4) to ﬁrst order in the velocity diﬀerence as

vi (n + 1) − vi (n) = [

b
vi (n) ×

b
vi (n + 1)] × vi (n) = [

vi (n) × ui (n)] × vi (n) .

As we are interested in the rate of change of the velocity we divide this equation by the time step duration τ . This
gives

In view of Eq. (5) the left hand side of Eq. (7) gives the continuous time derivative. In other words we may introduce

the following deﬁnition:

ωvi =

Using that ui (n) =

vi (n + 1) it follows from Eq. (7) that

b

ui (n + 1) − ui (n) = τ ωui (n) × ui (n) ,

where the angular velocity ωui (n) corresponding to the average velocity ui (n) is deﬁned as

ωui (n) = ωvi (n + 1) .

It can be shown that

Furthermore one may show that

Combining Eqs. (12) and (14) results in

ωvi (n) = ωui (n) − τ ui (n) × ¨

vi (n) = ui (n) × ˙ui (n) − τ ui (n) × ¨

vi (n) ,

which to ﬁrst order in the velocity diﬀerence implies that for the angular velocity associated with the particle velocity
vi we obtain the following expression:

b

b

ωvi (n) = ωui (n) − τ ui (n) × ¨

ui (n) = ui (n) × ˙ui (n) .

The second equality follows from the fact that the second derivative ¨ui (n) is parallel to ui (n) to ﬁrst order in the
diﬀerence.

b

Replacing n by the time t the resulting equation of motion becomes:

dvi(t)
dt

= ωui(t) × vi(t) = [ui(t) × ˙ui(t)] × vi(t).

This equation is continuous in time and is derived from the discrete CVA rule using Eq. (5).
In order to obtain
equations for the velocity and the density ﬁelds, which are continuous in space, we will coarse-grain Eqs. (17) and
(18) in the next section. We note that both dvi (t) /dt and ˙ui (t) are zero in the low density regions.

III. CONTINUOUS TRANSPORT EQUATIONS

In this section we introduce the averaging procedure for the discrete model. We derive continuous equations for

the velocity and the density ﬁelds by averaging the discrete equations.

In our continuum model the number density, n(r, t), satisﬁes the continuity equation,

∂n(r, t)
∂t

+ div (n(r, t) v(r, t)) = 0 .

The dynamics of the velocity ﬁeld is such that the kinetic energy density is conserved, d|v(r, t)|2/dt = 0. The time
derivative of the velocity ﬁeld is therefore given by

d
dt

∂
∂t

v (r, t) =

v (r, t) + v (r, t) · gradv (r, t) = ω (r, t) × v (r, t) .

where ω (r, t) is some angular velocity ﬁeld. We will discuss how to obtain this angular velocity ﬁeld in terms of the
velocity and density ﬁelds below.

In the CVA algorithm the direction of the average velocity in the neighborhood of particle i is given for the

continuous time description by

ui (t) =

H (rij (t)) vj (t)

H (rij (t)) vj (t)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

where rij = |ri − rj|. The dynamics of individual particles therefore reduces the diﬀerence between the direction of its
velocity and that of the average velocity of the surrounding particles. H (r) is an averaging kernel, which we assume
to be normalized,

H (r) dr = 1 .

Z

It has the characteristic averaging scale R, beyond which the kernel goes to zero [5, 15]. Usually one uses for H a
normalized Heaviside step function.

In order to obtain a continuous description we deﬁne the average particle density (per unit of volume) and velocity

ﬁelds by

Using Eq.(23) in Eq.(21) for r = ri, it follows that ui (t) =
Eq. (18) can therefore be written as

v (ri (t) , t), where

v (ri (t) , t) = v (ri (t) , t) /|v (ri (t) , t) |.

By evaluating the time derivative between the square brackets on the right hand side one obtains

n (r, t) =

H (r − rj(t)) ,

n (r, t) v (r, t) =

H (r − rj(t)) vj(t) .

In view of the fact that the gradient of the direction of the average velocity is of the ﬁrst order and that the velocity
diﬀerence is also of the ﬁrst order, the ﬁrst contribution on the right hand side is of the second order and can be
neglected. Eq. (25) therefore reduces to

Note that both dvi (t) /dt and d
v (ri (t) , t) /dt are zero in the low density regions. When we now average this equation
we can use the fact that the expression between the square brackets only depends on the coarse grained functions and
b
therefore varies slowly over the range of the averaging function.
Averaging the left hand side of Eq. (26) and using the continuity equation we obtain

where we neglected the term of the second order in the velocity diﬀerence. This term would give a small contribution

This is the angular velocity ﬁeld obtained from the discrete algorithm used by T. Vicsek et al.

natural that f (n) → 0 as n → 0. A more thorough analysis of this is beyond our present aim, however.

Before comparing this expression to the one we used in Refs.

[21, 22] we ﬁrst verify that stationary linear and the
vortical solutions are solutions of Eq. (33). In view of their stationarity the ﬁrst contribution in Eq. (33) is equal to
zero. For a linear ﬂow v = v0 ex the other two terms and the left hand side of Eq. (33) are also zero. Stationary
linear ﬂow is therefore a solution. In case of stationary vortical ﬂow, v = vϕ(r) eϕ (ϕ), the v · ∇v term on the left
hand side of Eq. (33) cancels the terms due to the second and the third term. The continuity equation, Eq. (19), is
satisﬁed for each density distribution which varies only in directions normal to the ﬂow direction. It follows that the
continuous analog of the CVA model has stationary linear and vortical solutions.

In our ﬁrst paper [21] we used an angular velocity ﬁeld which was a linear combination of n (r, t) rot v (r, t) and

∇n (r, t) × v (r, t). The resulting equation of motion becomes

dv
dt

= s1n (rot v) × v + s2 (∇n × v) × v.

(35)

The ﬁrst term is analogous to the third term on the right hand side of Eq. (33). Similar to the CVA model this
choice leads to stationary linear and vortical solutions. The linear dependence of our choice on the density leads to a
dependence of the stationary velocity ﬁeld on the density distribution. We refer to [21, 22] for a detailed discussion
of these solutions. For a small density the right hand side of Eq. (35) makes dv/dt negligible. This is similar to the
behavior in Eq. (34).

When one modiﬁes the updating rule in the CVA model, as done in Refs. [7, 8, 9], this leads to a modiﬁcation of
the ω given in Eq. (32). Similarly, the choice of ω we used in [21, 22] can be modiﬁed to include such contributions.
The freedom in the choice of ω in the continuous version of the CVA model is one of its strength.

In our ﬁrst paper [21] we constructed a continuous self propelling particle model with particle number and kinetic
energy conservation. In this paper we addressed the problem to derive the continuous description from the discrete

IV. CONCLUSIONS

7

model proposed by T. Vicsek et al. [5]. We were able to derive expressions for the angular velocity ﬁeld used in the
continuous model from the updating procedures used in their model. By coarse graining the discrete equations in the
original model we obtained the angular velocity ﬁeld used to give the co-moving time derivative of the velocity ﬁeld
in the continuous description. Modiﬁcation of the updating rules in this model, as done in Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9], results in
modiﬁcations of the resulting angular velocity ﬁeld. The angular velocity ﬁeld used in our work [21, 22] is one of such
choices. One of the contributions in the continuous version of the CVA model is very similar to one of the contributions
which we have postulated in our hydrodynamic model [21]. Both the continuous CVA model and our model lead
to the linear and vortical ﬂows of the self propelling particles observed in nature and obtained in simulations and
continuum approximations. This shows that they are appropriate for the description of ﬂocking behavior, which is
one of the aims of the model. An interesting alternative choice of ω (r, t) in the continuous description is for instance
∇cA × v where cA is the concentration of an attractant. As was shown in A. Czir´ok et al. [7] this choice can be used
to describe rotorchemotaxis. Note that the term ∇n (r, t) × v (r, t), which we considered in our continuum model, is
similar to the one considered by A. Czir´ok et al. when the concentration ﬁeld is proportional to the concentration of
the attractant.

Our analysis shows that one may coarse grain the discrete updating rules and obtain the corresponding continuous
description. This makes a direct comparison between discrete and continuous descriptions possible. For our own work
it was found that our continuous description was similar to the continuous version of the original CVA model but not
identical. The analysis in this paper makes it possible to extend our work on the continuous description such that it
is either closer or more diﬀerent from the original CVA model.

Abstract

Starting from the linear ﬂow of homogeneous ﬂuid, ﬁve modes are deﬁned as eigenvectors of the

basic system of conservation laws. Quasi-plane geometry is considered. Projectors that separate overall

perturbation of the ﬂuid into speciﬁc modes are calculated and applied to nonlinear ﬂow. Dynamic

equations for the interacting modes are obtained in the frames of the method. A particular case

of streaming caused by acoustic pulse is considered, illustrations on temporal behavior of streaming

velocity and streamlines are presented.

INTRODUCTION

Streaming is known as a bulk vortical movement of the ﬂuid following an

intense acoustic wave. Streaming appears in closed and open vessels in two-

or three-dimensional geometry and is observed in viscous ﬂuids only. Though

vortical movement may exist in the linear ﬂow, the reason of streaming are

the nonlinear losses of momentum of acoustic ﬁeld. A reader is referred to the

comprehensive reviews on this subject [1], [2], [3]. Most recent investigations

both theoretical and experimental relate to steady (quasi-steady) streaming

[4].

It is well-known that streaming is a slow process in comparison to the

ultrasound and may be separated from the originating sound by time-averaging

over integer number of periods of sound. The averaging is a starting point

of the modern theory [2], [3]. A driving force of streaming is quadratic and

therefore does not vanish during the temporal averaging. Some inconsistencies

of the approach based on temporal averaging are obvious. It was ﬁrst pointed

out by Rudenko and Soluyan that studying acoustic streaming while assuming

incompressibility was inadequate [2]. The eﬀect of compressibility of the ﬂuid

has not been discussed in depth. Recently, the importance of compressibility

has been demonstrated for ﬂow over plane rigid boundary [5]. It is more evident

in gases and leads to larger streaming velocities.

We may add that incompressibility neglects not only acoustic waves but also

another slow compound of the overall ﬂow, namely the entropy modal ﬁeld that

appears in one-dimensional geometry of ﬂow even. Entropy mode appears due

to losses of acoustic energy and therefore has a diﬀerent nature than streaming.

Velocity of this ﬁeld is small in comparison to streaming [8], the main feature

of entropy ﬁeld is slow isobaric growth of temperature that leads to the new

2

background of acoustic wave propagation. This eﬀect called by acoustic wave

self-action is well-studied [16]. Excluding the entropy mode needs a neglecting

of equation of energy balance that reduces an initial system of conservation laws

and allows to consider ﬂows with unperturbed density. At last, an excluding of

the energy balance does not allow to account heat conductivity though it has

been proved that the eﬀect of the heat conductivity could not be discarded in

a study of temperature variation associated with the streaming [6]. Actually,

this approximation is well understood in a typical liquid like water but should

be revised for other liquids [7].

The dynamic equations are derived by proper combining the conservation

laws in diﬀerential form. These calculations may be considered as a certain

type of projecting at the chosen type of motion. We propose to determine

modes and correspondent matrix projectors from the very beginning at the

level of linearized system of conservation laws.

It seems reasonable to start

from the full system of conservation laws including the energy balance equation

and the continuity equation to avoid possible inconsistencies.

Though ultrasound of many periods is most eﬃcient source of streaming, any

other acoustic source in thermoviscous ﬂow gives rise to other modal ﬁelds. The

modern theory fails to treat non-periodic sound. That is one more reason to

ﬁnd new methods (analytical more desired) in ﬂuid dynamics and particulary

in the theory of streaming. The idea to decompose the linear ﬂow into speciﬁc

modes is not novel and has been exploited for a long time, see the paper by Chu,

and Kovasznay [9] and referred there papers, where homogeneous background

with sources of heat and mass are considered. This paper is almost the only

one in which interaction between modes is introduced locally (see also report by

3

Kaner, Rudenko, Khokhlov [10], where a ﬁrst step has been made in a manner

to introduce interaction of opposite acoustic waves via connection equations).

The account of nonlinear interactions by Chu, and Kovasznay [9] was performed

by the simple perturbation theory - by decomposition of each variable in series

of small parameters of nonlinearity and dissipation.

The concrete ideas of doing it automatically by using of projectors in the

wide variety of problems was realized for ﬂow over inhomogeneous media like

bubbly liquid [11], ﬂows aﬀected by external forces including the gravitational

one which changes the background density and pressure [12], both one- and

multi-dimensional problems [13]). The principal advance is an expansion of the

ideas into area of nonlinear ﬂow: to get nonlinear coupled evolution equations

for interacting modes and to solve the system approximately. The choice of

the subspaces by the projecting (ﬁxed links between variables) is the principal

point of evolution equations derivation. It results in the expansion of projection

of the evolution operator as a function of a small parameter , that is equivalent

to the nonsingular perturbation theory [14]. Any weak interactions of modes

in ﬂuid dynamics may be considered. Streaming is a particular case of the

interaction of modes when the acoustic mode is dominant and inverse inﬂuence

of the growing vortical end entropy modes neglected.

As basic variable (which all other perturbations are expressed through) the

Fourier transform of density perturbation is chosen for the ﬁrst three modes.

Vorticites σ4, σ5 are chosen for the last two because the vortical modes possess no

density and pressure perturbations. All calculations of the modes and projectors

have accuracy up to the terms of order µ, β. Speciﬁc features of the modes

follow from Eqs(.11 ): both vorticity modes keep unperturbed density, entropy

mode is isobaric, and so on. Any ﬁeld of the linear ﬂow is sought as a sum of

independent modes. To calculate projectors that decompose a concrete mode

STREAMING.

STREAMING CASED BY ANY ACOUSTIC SOURCE. RADIATION FORCE OF

The streaming as secondary ﬂow induced by losses of acoustic momentum

and its partial nonlinear transfer to the momentum of vortical mode is best

observable when nonlinear eﬀects may store with time. Most experiments deal

with quasi-periodic waves or wave packets of many periods. That gives rise

to the theoretical basis concerning namely to this kind of source. An area of

projecting is much more extended that streaming since all possible interactions

of modes may be calculated. From the point of view of nonlinear interactions,

streaming is a particular case of dominant acoustic source inducing the vortical

ﬂow. The governing evolution equation follows when one acts by sum of projec-

tors P4 + P5 at the system of Eqs(.4). Only acoustic terms related to the ﬁrst

mode (rightwards progressive) should be left at the both quadratic columns .

Physically, that corresponds to the initial stage of nonlinear interaction when

the acoustic mode is dominant and the inverse inﬂuence of the streaming may

11

be ignored. Also, the generation of heat is ignored. A dynamic equation for

The radiation force appears in the viscous ﬂow only. As expected, all quadratic

nonlinear terms in the acoustic source of order β0 give zero in sum and therefore

attenuation is necessary for acoustic streaming to exist. Acoustic pressure p1

should be a solution of KZK equation. Projectors P4,P5 and their sum yield in

the vortical radiation force automatically due to their origin.

Let us discuss the result to demonstrate the diﬀerence between a periodic

and pulsed acoustic sources.

1. In a case of a pulsed ultrasound as in the papers [19], [20] with a car-

rier frequency ω0 the solution of the equation (.19) with the right-hand side

of Eq.(.20) contains relatively small (non-growing) part, oscillating with the

frequency 2ω0. It is known, that there is also a term growing proportional to

time, that arises from constant average of a squared oscillating functions that

is evident from the identity Sin2(ω0t) = (1

Cos(2ω0t))/2. If one take a wave-

−

train of a rectangular form, it gives the input proportional to P 2

0 τ /2; in the case
0 τ 2/4 (both per pulse). The second result is

of a triangular pulse one gets P 2

obviously larger if τ > 2π/ω0. This simple example explains why the streaming

amplitude depends on pulse structure of the source. Experimental data prov-

ing the larger velocity of streaming caused by pulsed mode are discussed by

12

Starritt, Duck, and Humphrey [19].

2. It is very important that now the averaged force

contains the addi-

tional terms that cancel in the case of a periodic sound ﬁeld. The integration

by parts highlights the point:

,

(.21)

the right-hand side is obviously zero for a spatially periodic function with pe-

riod ∆y standing for the acoustic pressure. This shows non-equivalence of the

expressions for the force obtained by averaging procedure by diﬀerent authors

delivered in diﬀerent stages of the streaming equation derivation.

In other

words if one adds such expression to the force, the mean value of it survives in

a periodic wave case while for any deviation of periodicity the term contributes.

Radiation force given by Gusev, Rudenko [18] in the special case of strongly

attenuated quasi-periodic acoustic beam with weak diﬀraction is given by

NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSIONS.

In the frames of report by Gusev, Rudenko [18], a strongly attenuated non-

diﬀracting acoustic beam in unbounded volume is considered. The calculations

give values of frequencies above 1MHz in air in the case of radiator with a ra-

dius of order 0.1m. That considerably simpliﬁes the further calculations since

a source should be thought as a solution of the KZK equation and till now does

not have an appropriate mathematical basis. Even the Kholhlov-Zabotskaya

(KZ) equation suitable for ﬂows without attenuation is extremely diﬃcult for

analytical solution: evaluating of ﬂow in the paraxial region needs many inter-

mediate calculations [23]. In spite of general formula on radiation force given

by Eq.(.20), any simple solution is desired for illustrations though the stream-

ing caused by any other wave satisfying the KZK equation may be treated by

this formula. As an appropriate acoustic source satisfying the limitations of

paper by Gusev, Rudenko [18], let us take a mono-polar two-dimensional wave

as follows [2]:

perturbations where eﬀective Mach number and wave length may be sought

independent. Constant C is responsible for the shape of the curve:

large C

provides a curve close to the Gauss one. To calculate a transverse velocity

V1x, the ﬁrst, corresponding force F1x should be calculated, and the second, the

momentum equation (.19) has to be solved.

The formula of this chapter apply to the three-dimensional ﬂow and are also

14

suitable in the two-dimensional or plane one. Generally, two parameters µx,µz

instead of one µ responsible for the geometry of ﬂow may be introduced from

the very beginning. To consider two-dimensional geometry, the ﬂow over z-axis

supposed to be uniform. To calculate the ﬁeld of velocity accordingly to this

last equation, let us do some remarks. It is important that the hydrodynamic

nonlinearity which is necessary in periodic sources (otherwise the streaming

grows inﬁnitely [17] [18] [7]) may be not considered in the pulse dynamics,

because of absence in this case the storage of nonlinear eﬀects. Amplitudes of

the generated streaming is so small that the quadratic term such as this one

may be omitted. Without the mentioned term, Eq.(.19) is a simple equation of

the heat conductivity with viscous coeﬃcient cased by shear viscosity δ2

1 with

an acoustic source in the right-hand side.

In order to simplify calculations, the viscous term in Eq.(.19) will be ignored.

The same limit relating to low shear viscosity was considered in the referred

paper by Gusev, Rudenko [18]. Note that viscous terms grow signiﬁcantly near

the discontinuity of the proﬁle of Vx, that never happens to a smooth proﬁle

caused by pressure source given by Eq.(.25). To calculate the temporal ﬁeld of

velocity at a set of co-ordinates y, the integration of the radiation force F1x has

been occurred:

Vx =

F1xdt.

Z

0

(.26)

For any co-ordinate y, ignoring of viscous term results in stationary velocity

after the source passed. The reason is the constant result of integration of the

source from minus inﬁnity till plus inﬁnity.

Indeed, there is an attenuation

in the very Eq.(.19), not only in the attenuated acoustic source, so for the

more detail calculations it should be involved. The radiation force also needs

15

integration over y, the constant of integration is chosen to be zero when y

diﬀraction is ignored:

(.27)

so all calculations of velocity in this paper refer to the point x = √2

2 where the
radiation force achieves maximum. Constants of Eq.(.25) used in calculations

are: C = 2, ǫ = 1.2, β = 0.1

Figure 1 shows the temporal development of velocity Vx of streaming divided

by √µβ (one may get dimension values by multiplying by c) at diﬀerent points
y:1, 2, 3,.. 10; x = √2/2. The stationary ﬁeld of Vx

√µβ after passing the source is
presented by Fig. 2. It is evident that velocity of streaming tends to a constant

level with time passing in contrast to the streaming caused by periodic source

when hydrodynamic nonlinearity ignored.

The next, the streamlines may be plotted due to the calculated Vx and the

known relation for the vector ﬁeld: −→
∇

−→V = 0. The following integration with the

proper constant should be occurred over y to get a ﬁeld of longitudinal velocity

Vy. Finally, the calculated streamlines at t = 3, t = 5 are shown at the ﬁgures

3,4(a) both with the dimensionless pressure of acoustic source correspondingly

(Fig. 3,4(b)). The symmetrical lines of the curves are x = 0.5 at the upper

half-space and x =

0.5 at the lower one due to the chosen shape of the source

−

given by exp(

x2).

Some calculations of dimensional parameters of ﬂow seems to be useful under

limitations of report by Gusev, Rudenko [18]. Quantitative evaluation relates

to air. For example, a characteristic length of source is Λ

Pressure of acoustic source and therefore streaming depends on small param-

ities of streaming are hardly expected while there is no storage of nonlinear

transport of acoustic momentum over many periods. Nevertheless it looks not

extremely small in comparison to the measured values of streaming that vary

from 10−

streaming velocities down to 10−

4m/sec [20].

CONCLUSIONS

The most important result of the projecting is to get space and temporal

structure of any mode independently of the type of source. The basic idea

of the projecting starts from separating modes accordingly to their speciﬁc

properties in the weakly nonlinear ﬂow. These basic motions (or eigenvectors of

the linear ﬂow) should be deﬁned at ﬁrst. It may be proceeded in the algorithmic

way for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous backgrounds ( see paper on

interacting modes in bubbly liquid [11]), media aﬀected by external forces and

the real geometry of the ﬂow. The deﬁnition of modes is unique, determined

by the linearized diﬀerential conservation equations only. The ﬂow in bounded

volumes or relating to problems that need special conditions has to be sought as

a superposition of speciﬁc modes corresponding to the concrete problem. Any

17

mode is distinguished by a correspondent projector at any time. Projectors

apply to arbitrary source and type of initial perturbation.

The next, the interaction of modes in weakly nonlinear ﬂow yields in coupled

nonlinear equations for the modes that may be solved approximately [11], [14].

Moreover, the evolution equations may be corrected up to the higher order

nonlinear terms due to increasing inﬂuence of the other generated modes. In

the present paper, rightwards acoustic mode is sought as a dominant one which

gives rise to the vortical one. Therefore, the governing equation (.19) involves

a pure quadratic acoustic source. For more advanced ﬂow, the growing role

of the non-dominative modes due to nonlinear interactions may be accounted

as well. The similar calculations were undertaken while one-dimensional ﬂow

studied [11].

Since the method applies to ﬂow with any initial conditions (including non-

acoustic) and does not need quasi-periodic sources, it is useful for investigation

of some special problems like streaming caused by the non-periodic mono-polar

acoustic source. The possibilities of analytical methods in the study of stream-

ing are superior over experimental and purely numerical investigations in the

view of complexity of the whole phenomenon. In this paper, the general for-

mulae on interacting modes are presented, and the particular case of streaming

caused by mono-polar source is discussed and illustrated by numerical calcula-

tions. A special meaning of the quasi-periodic and particulary pulse ultrasound

is its importance in medicine, in delicate exploring of the parameters of ﬂuid

as well as importance of the secondary modes following the source, e.g.in the

sonochemistry [21] .

In preparation for an experimental study of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metal,
we explore Couette ﬂows having height comparable to the gap between cylinders, centrifugally stable
rotation, and high Reynolds number. Experiments in water are compared with numerical simula-
tions. Simulations show that endcaps corotating with the outer cylinder drive a strong poloidal
circulation that redistributes angular momentum. Predicted azimuthal ﬂow proﬁles agree well with
experimental measurements. Spin-down times scale with Reynolds number as expected for laminar
Ekman circulation; extrapolation from two-dimensional simulations at Re ≤ 3200 agrees remarkably
well with experiment at Re ∼ 106. This suggests that turbulence does not dominate the eﬀective
viscosity. Further detailed numerical studies reveal a strong radially inward ﬂow near both endcaps.
After turning vertically along the inner cylinder, these ﬂows converge at the midplane and depart
the boundary in a radial jet. To minimize this circulation in the MRI experiment, endcaps con-
sisting of multiple, diﬀerentially rotating rings are proposed. Simulations predict that an adequate
approximation to the ideal Couette proﬁle can be obtained with a few rings.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Laboratory experiments using liquid metal have made important tests of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theories and
processes. Examples include laboratory demonstration of the Alfv´en wave[1], magnetoﬂuid convection[2], and dynamo
action[3]. Recently, a new kind of liquid-metal MHD experiment, motivated by astrophysics, has been proposed by
the authors[4, 5] to study magnetorotational instability (MRI), which is believed to dominate the transport of angular
momentum in electrically conducting accretion disks. Liquid gallium will be used in a Couette ﬂow between cylinders
2Ω2 > r2
of radii r1 < r2 and angular velocities 0 < Ω2 < Ω1 but r2
1Ω1 so that the ﬂow will be stable against conventional
Taylor-Couette instabilities (TCI).

Both TCI and MRI are governed by the radial proﬁle of azimuthal velocity, vϕ(r). In an inviscid ﬂuid, TCI occurs
rvϕ, decreases outwards, dJ 2/dr < 0. If the ﬂuid is also a perfect
wherever the speciﬁc angular momentum, J
vϕ/r, decreases outwards, dΩ2/dr < 0. In this case,
electrical conductor, MRI occurs when the angular velocity, Ω
MRI can occur in an arbitrarily weak axial magnetic ﬁeld; the ﬁeld must at any rate be weak enough so that the
transit time of Alfv´en waves across the ﬂow is less than Ω−1. The usual situation in accretion disks, which are often
r−3/2 (Kepler’s law) so that TCI is stabilized but MRI is not. In a ﬂuid with large
excellent conductors, is Ω
resistivity and ﬁnite but small viscosity, such as liquid metals, the range of ﬂow parameters unstable to MRI shrinks
signiﬁcantly, while the range unstable to TCI is eﬀectively unchanged. Therefore, laboratory ﬂows must be set up
with precision in order to demonstrate MRI while suppressing TCI.

In previous linear stability analyses of gallium Couette ﬂow[4, 5], we adopted periodic boundary condition in the
vertical (axial) direction, ignoring the eﬀects of the top and bottom interior surfaces of the vessel (“endcaps”). The
choice of vertical boundary conditions is probably inconsequential when the height of the ﬂow (H) is much larger
than the gap width, as in Taylor’s classic experiments[6]. Our experimental volume πH(r2
r2
1) will be limited by
the availability of gallium, a far more expensive ﬂuid than water, while the gap must be wide enough so that the
magnetic diﬀusion time is not much shorter than the rotation period. These considerations drive us to an aspect ratio
H/(r2

O(1), in which the endcaps may assume great importance.

We have performed a water experiment and complementary numerical simulations to study the eﬀects of the endcaps
and, if possible, to ﬁnd a way to set up a short Couette ﬂow that is unstable to MRI yet stable against TCI. Since the
viscosities of the two ﬂuids are similar, standard visualization techniques in water serve to predict the ﬂow structure
in the opaque liquid gallium, at least in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld.

Since the pioneering work by Benjamin[7, 8, 9], TCI in ﬁnite size cylinders have been studied in detail with stationary
outer cylinders[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], and with rotating outer cylinders[21]. In our TCI-stable ﬂows,
the outer cylinder must rotate. To allow a wide gap, we use a relatively small radial aspect ratio η = r1/r2 = 0.256,
so that the commonly used narrow-gap approximation does not apply. The rotation rate of the inner cylinder (Ω1) is
so high that the Reynolds number

is orders of magnitude larger than typical Couette ﬂow experiments. In connection with research on the tropospheric
jet stream, Dunst performed a water experiment in a short cylindrical annulus with parameters similar to ours[22].
We will comment on this paper in section V.

The outline of the paper is as follows. Sec.II describes the experimental apparatus and most of our experimental
results, except for spin-down measurements, which are deferred to Sec.IV. Numerical methods are described in Sec.III,
and numerical simulations are presented and compared with experiment in Sec.IV. Sec.V contains a summary of our
main results and a discussion of their signiﬁcance.

II. WATER EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental Apparatus

The experiments are performed in a short circular Couette ﬂow illustrated in Fig. 1. A container, made of trans-
parent acrylic plates and cylinders, is mounted on a stainless steel ﬂange which is driven by a DC motor (1.25 HP,
by Creative Industries). The speed is measured by a laser-based tachometer. The inner cylinder, made of aluminum,
is inserted through a lip seal from the top and is driven in the direction of the container by an AC motor (3 HP,
by Lincoln Motors) with a controller. For given speeds of inner and outer cylinders, Ω1 and Ω2, the ﬂow typically
requires about 10-30 seconds to reach a steady state, in which most of the ﬂow measurements are performed.

B. Measurement of Azimuthal Flow Proﬁles

In order to measure ﬂow proﬁles as a function of radius and height, small particles with sizes on the order of 1 µm
made of mica and titanium dioxide (“Sparkle”by Lee S. McDonald, Inc.) are mixed into the working ﬂuid (water).
Being small, the particles follow the ﬂow well. A sheet of light of approximate thickness of 0.5 cm is generated by
a horizontal slot in front of a bright halogen light source. An electronically gated intensiﬁed-CCD camera (by ITT
Corp.) images the ﬂow illuminated by the sheet, whose height is adjustable. Images are saved to a PC using a frame-
grabber at a rate of 60 images per second. Particles appear in the images as streaks, whose length indicates ﬂow
speed. By combining measurements at many radii and heights, the azimuthal ﬂow can be mapped out as a function
of r and z. The measurements were calibrated, at various heights, by imposing uniform rotation, Ω1 = Ω2 = 150 rpm.
The experimental results are shown in Fig. 2 for the case of Ω1 = 2000 rpm and Ω2= 150 rpm. There are a few
characteristics worth mentioning here. First, the measured velocity is signiﬁcantly smaller than in an ideal, inﬁnitely
long Couette ﬂow having the same Ω1 and Ω2 [eq.(A1)]. The discrepancy is largest at small radii. Secondly, the
velocity must rise sharply from
8 m/s. Unfortunately, diagnostic access to
the ﬂow is limited near the inner, outer, and top boundaries. Thirdly, the azimuthal velocity decreases with radius
except at the locations near the outer edge, whereas it would decrease everywhere in the ideal Couette ﬂow. Fourthly,
the dependence on z is at most comparable to the experimental errors. This is consistent with Taylor-Proudman
theorem [23] which predicts small z variations in a rotating ﬂow with small viscosity.

FIG. 2: Measured vϕ proﬁle at diﬀerent z when Ω1 = 2000 rpm and Ω2= 150 rpm.

The observed proﬁle of azimuthal ﬂow has unfavorable implications for the proposed MRI experiments. The goal
is to set up a ﬂow unstable to MRI while stable to TCI. However, the sharp decrease of vϕ near the inner cylinder
will certainly incite TCI while the rest of the ﬂow, because vϕ falls more slowly than intended, will be more resistant
to the MRI. As a result, the system as a whole could have a mixture of both instabilities or, even worse, only the
TCI. The observed deviations from ideal Couette ﬂow are due to the endcaps. They need to be understood and, if
possible, to be minimized in order to demonstrate MRI unambiguously. We note that a proposed MRI experiment
using sodium [24] should suﬀer from the same complications since its aspect ratio is also small, viz. H/(r2
r1) = 2.

III. NUMERICAL METHODS

A. Mathematical Model and Algorithm

We have developed a 2-dimensional computer code to simulate the water experiment described in the previous
section. We use the stream function-vorticity method[25] in cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z), as illustrated in Fig. 3.
v = 0, we can express the poloidal components

B. Simulation Method

The boundary conditions (7), (8), and (9) require a jump of vϕ(r) at the corners (r = r1, z =

H/2). A commonly
used technique to avoid this singularity is to make a small “buﬀer region” r1
H/2)
varies smoothly[26]. But we found that such a “buﬀer region” is not necessary in our scheme. Following the standard
technique, we ﬁrst set ǫ to 10% of the gap width r2
r1, and then gradually reduced it to the radial mesh size, ∆r.
In the latter case the angular velocity of the boundary jumps from Ω1 to Ω2 between the innermost two grid points
(i = 1, 2). We conﬁrmed that simulation results are not aﬀected by the size of ǫ. All calculations shown in this paper
use ǫ = ∆r.

IV. RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS

A. Parameters and units

The simulations shown in this section use the same dimensions and rotation rates as as the experiments described

in Sec. II. The computational units of length, velocity, and time are ℓ = r2

r1, v = r1Ω1, and ℓ/v.

The Reynolds number of the experiment [eq.(1)] is too high for direct numerical simulation. So we start by
simulating very low Re and increase it until we ﬁnd characteristics of the ﬂow that depend only weakly on Re or
follow a clear scaling. The largest simulated Re that we report is 3200.

−

6

FIG. 4: Simulated vϕ proﬁle when Re = 1.

B. Low Re ﬂows

The sudden acceleration of the boundaries at the beginning of the simulation induces an intense ﬂow inside the

vessel. At small values of the ﬁnal rotation rate, i.e. small Re, the ﬂuid quickly relaxes to a laminar steady state.

Figure 4 shows the azimuthal speed, vϕ, for Re = 1. The maximum speed is achieved at the inner cylinder (on
left in Fig. 4), where vϕ = 1. In this low Re limit, poloidal ﬂow is almost absent; the maximum value of vr and vz
10−4. Note that the jump in Ω at the lefthand corners of the boundary does not prevent a smooth solution
is 7.5
elsewhere.

×

Actually, as Re

0, the solution for the ﬂow can be found in closed form. If we set vr = vz = ωϕ = 0 in the basic

equations (12)–(13), the stationary azimuthal ﬂow vϕ satisﬁes

→

vϕ = 0,

(18)

with the boundary conditions (7)–(9). Wendl[27] has given the analytical solution of this equation with slightly
diﬀerent boundary conditions, corresponding to Ω2 = 0. The solution to our problem is given simply by adding a
uniformly rotating component rΩ2 to Wendl’s solution. The vϕ proﬁle shown in Fig. 4 is essentially identical to the
analytical solution thus constructed. This serves as one benchmark for our code.

C. High Re ﬂows

We have seen that poloidal ﬂow is negligible in the low Re regime. As we increase Re, poloidal circulation develops
and the azimuthal ﬂow changes. Figure 5 shows cross sections in the poloidal (r, z) plane for diﬀerent Re numbers,
from 100 to 3200. Each panel in Fig. 5 is a snapshot of the nonlinearly saturated state.

Figure 5(a) shows that vϕ has much the same pattern at Re = 100 as at Re = 1 (Fig. 4). In both cases, it is
symmetric about the horizontal plane z = 0 and time independent. The ﬂow becomes unsteady at Re > 400. The
asymmetric proﬁle of Re = 800 [Fig. 5(d)] results from unsteady ﬂow. All ﬂows above this Reynolds number ﬂuctuate,
with an amplitude that increases with Re.

One of the important features shown in Fig. 5 is that the contours of vϕ tend to be parallel to the rotation axis
(z). This is a manifestation of the Taylor-Proudman theorem, viz., that low-frequency horizontal motions tend to be
independent of height in an inviscid ﬂuid rotating about a vertical axis[28]. The Taylor-Proudman theorem is usually
discussed for an almost rigidly rotating ﬂuid, but as shown in the Appendix, a similar tendency exists in diﬀerentially
rotating ﬂow provided dJ 2/dr > 0.

Another characteristic feature of the vϕ contours in Fig. 5 is their tendency to concentrate towards the inner cylinder
(at left) at large Re. This shows the development of a boundary layer. Boundary layers also develop on the top and

7

bottom endcaps [see panels (e) and (f)]. Note also the increasingly sharp protrusion of the contours on the inner
cylinder near the midplane.

The development of the poloidal (vr, vz) ﬂow is equally interesting. It is shown in the vector plots of Fig. 6 for
the same simulations as in Fig. 5. Vectors appear at every third grid point in r and z. Their lengths indicate that
the poloidal component becomes stronger at higher Re. The arrow lengths are linearly normalized. The amplitude
of the unit velocity, that is the rotation speed of the inner cylinder, is indicated by arrows on the top of the panels
(a) to (f). A radially outward, jet-like ﬂow is seen near the midplane in the higher-Re simulations. It is undoubtedly
the counterpart of the spike in the vϕ contours in Fig. 5. This jet-like ﬂow was not expected before we began our
numerical simulations. Its structure will be analyzed later. Here we show the temporal behavior of the poloidal ﬂow,
including the jet.

The jet ﬂaps unsteadily. Figure 7 shows the time development of the stream function, ψ, for Re = 3200 over
almost half of the period of oscillation of the jet. The period of the oscillation is about 36.95 in the normalized time.
Figure 7(a) is a snapshot taken at t = 1326.68, and subsequent panels (b) to (f) are taken with regular 5.82 interval
time. Throughout the oscillation, the root of the jet (at r = r1, z = 0) remains ﬁxed while its tip ﬂaps violently up
and down. The vector plot in panel (f) of Fig. 6 shows a snapshot of this ﬂapping motion at t = 1294.67.

D. Proﬁle of Azimuthal Flow

Figure 8 shows vϕ(r) for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers (200

3200) at z = 4cm. (This is the height where the
most reliable experimental data can be obtained.) One can see from this ﬁgure that the vϕ proﬁles are consistent for
the higher Re ﬂows, Re = 800, 1600, and 1600. Note also that the proﬁles for Re = 1600 and 3200 are very close,
suggesting possible convergence at large Re.

Re

≤

≤

In Fig. 9, we have superimposed the experimental data for vϕ at z = 4cm (shown also in Fig. 2) on the corresponding
proﬁles from simulations at Re = 1600 and 3200. The agreement is remarkable when one considers that the highest
Re achieved in simulations, which are in 2D, is a factor of 300 smaller than that of the experiment, which is 3D.

We have seen in Fig. 5 that the high Re (> 400) ﬂows are time dependent. To show the amplitude of the temporal
ﬂuctuations, snapshots of vϕ for Re = 1600 are superimposed in Fig. 10. (The curves in Fig. 9 are time averages.)
We can see that the amplitude is larger in the outer half of the ﬂow (r > 9cm). This can be explained by the ﬂapping
motion of the jet (see Fig. 7).

Both experiment and simulation indicate that the vϕ proﬁle is concave in the outer half of the ﬂow (Fig. 9), and
that vϕ(r) is an increasing function of radius near the outer cylinder (12cm < r < 15cm). The ﬂuid in this region
rotates almost rigidly, on average, at the angular velocity of the outer cylinder and endcaps (Ω2).

Snapshots of the angular momentum J = rvϕ are shown in Fig. 11 for the same simulation and as in Fig. 10. Note
that dJ/dr > 0 for the ideal Couette ﬂow (solid curve) since we aim for stability against the Taylor-Couette mode.
An interesting feature of this ﬁgure is that the simulated J curve is even ﬂatter than the ideal proﬁle. This is a
consequence of the poloidal circulation and jet, which tend to mix angular momentum in the interior of the ﬂow.

In order to extract essential features of the spatial structure of the ﬂow, it would be convenient if we could suppress
its temporal ﬂuctuations, especially the ﬂapping of the jet. For this purpose, we have made a set of simulations with
the following symmetries imposed:

Fig. 12 shows the result when Re = 1600. One can perhaps interpret this state as an average of the ﬂow over one
period of the jet’s ﬂapping motion.

The panel (a) in Fig. 12 clearly shows the structure of the poloidal circulation. It consists of three main parts; (i)
inward ﬂow in boundary layers at the endcaps; (ii) axial ﬂow towards the midplane on the inner cylinder; and (iii) an
outward jet centered on the midplane.

The boundary layer on the inner cylinder has a characteristic triangular shape [panel (b) in Fig. 12]. The contours
are “squeezed” by the inward boundary-layer ﬂows near the top and the bottom caps, while, the tip of the triangle is
“pulled” by the outward jet ﬂow.

FIG. 8: Simulated vϕ proﬁle at z = 0.

The contour lines of vϕ and Ω [Fig. 12(b) and (c)] suggest that the ﬂow attempts to obey the Taylor-Proudman
theorem outside of the boundary layers and the jet. Since the latter regions are thin, especially at high Re, viscous
forces becomes important there and the Taylor-Proudman theorem does not hold.

The contour lines of Ω, Fig. 12(c), show that the the outer half of the ﬂuid rotates approximately at the angular
velocity of the outer cylinder and endcaps, as we have already seen in Figs. 10 and 11. We have also seen that the
angular momentum J tends to be uniform in the interior due to the poloidal circulation, as is clearly shown by the
central void in the contour plot of J in Fig. 12(d).

FIG. 10: Time variation of vϕ proﬁle for Re = 1600. The rigid rotation proﬁle of the endcaps and outer cylinder shown for
comparison.

The structures of the azimuthal and poloidal ﬂows are summarized schematically in Fig. 13.
One interesting but unexpected ﬁnding of these simulations is the existence of the jet.

Its characteristics are
summarized as follows: (1) The jet becomes thinner with increasing Re, and its width is similar to that of the
boundary layers on the caps; and (2) the jet is steady and symmetric at low Re but ﬂaps vertically above a critical
Reynolds number between 400 and 800.

Experimentally, it is not straightforward to conﬁrm the existence of a jet-like radial ﬂow directly. Since the maximum
radial velocity in the simulation is only a few percent of the large azimuthal ﬂow, the streaks on the camera images
would rotate only a few degrees, too little to be resolved by our measurements. At lower rotation speeds, we were
able visually to follow relatively large and neutrally buoyant particles in the water. We observed rather rapid outward
motions at the midplane after the particles were “sucked” into the boundary layers at the top or bottom endcaps.
This is consistent with the jet-like ﬂows indicated by the simulations.

FIG. 11: Time variation of angular momentum J = rvϕ for Re = 1600.

F. Boundary Layers

The width of the boundary layers (including the jet) depends on Re. As Fig. 6 indicates, higher Re causes thinner
boundary layers. Actually, the inward (negative vr) ﬂow on the top and bottom boundaries is induced by the same
mechanism as classical Ekman circulation: a viscous reduction of vϕ in the boundary layer, leading to an imbalance
between outward centrifugal force and the pressure gradient. The boundary layers at the endcaps in our system do
not have uniform width. As Figs. 12(a), (b), and (d) indicate, these layers are thick near the inner cylinder, reaching
roughly 10% of the vessel’s height (H). The width monotonically declines with increasing r, disappearing into the
rigid rotation part of the outer part of the ﬂuid. [See also Fig. 13(b).]

For small departures from rigid rotation, the Ekman layer thickness is δE =

ν/Ω, where ν is the kinematic
viscosity. Our system is very far from rigid rotation, so it is not immediately clear what to substitute for Ω. If one
p
1.24Re−1/2, hence
uses the mean frequency √Ω1Ω2, then for our geometry, δE/H
3% at Re = 1600. In fact, we
estimate from our simulations that the fractional thickness of the boundary layers is
10% at this Reynolds number.
For small departures from a diﬀerentially rotating state, however, we believe that it is more appropriate to scale δE
with the epicyclic frequency,

This is the maximum frequency of small axisymmetric motions (inertial oscillations) in the inviscid interior of the
ﬂuid, so it represents the inertial forces that must be balanced by viscous ones in order to drive a radial ﬂow along
the boundaries. Since κ reduces to 2Ω for rigid rotation, we take δE =

This leads to δE/H = 3.39Re−1/2, or

The numerical simulations presented so far have been performed for cylinders of height H = 10cm, hence about the
r1 = 11.1cm), as in our laboratory experiment. In order to elucidate the eﬀects of

the top and bottom endcaps on the ﬂuid motion, we have also performed numerical experiments for shorter heights:
H = 8, 6, 2, and 1cm. Figure 14 shows the corresponding ﬂow proﬁles after nonlinear saturation. The Reynolds
number, which is based on the cylinder radii rather than H [eq.(1)] is 1600 in all cases. Compare these with Fig. 5(e).
In the case of the shortest height (H = 1cm), most of the ﬂuid rotates at the angular velocity of the endcaps. This
is not surprising, since in the limit of inﬁnitesimal height, the ﬂuid would “adhere” to the endcaps. The more rapidly
rotating inner cylinder inﬂuences the ﬂow over a radial distance comparable to H. Comparing the panels of Fig. 14,
we see that the domain of rigid rotation shrinks as H grows, but it still exists when H = 10cm, as summarized in the
schematic Fig. 13(b). The existence of such a region in a short Couette ﬂow has also been reported by Dunst[22].

H. Spin Down

To better quantify the eﬀects of circulation, a series of experiments and simulations have been performed to study
the transient ﬂow when both cylinders (and endcaps) are suddenly stopped. The rate of spin down reﬂects the
eﬃciency with which the circulation transports angular momentum and the viscous coupling to the walls. In the
experiments, starting from steady rotation both cylinders were braked to a complete stop within about one second.

The ﬂow speed in a small volume was measured against time, as shown in Fig. 15.

A simple exponential ﬁt to the measured data is not appropriate because the spin-down time τ itself depends on

angular velocity:

is obtained.

Spin down has also been simulated by imposing a sudden stop of all boundaries. Figure 16 shows results for
azimuthal velocity in the same volume as in the experiment for Re = 3200. Again, the spin down time is obtained
by ﬁtting eq.(23), with the result τ = 0.82 sec. Figure 17 displays τ determined similarly for a series of simulations
at diﬀerent Re. The trend is well ﬁt by a power law (dashed line),

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Motivated by our proposed magnetohydrodynamic experiment[4, 5], we have studied a short, wide-gap, hydrody-
namic Couette ﬂow by experiment and numerical simulation. A challenge of the gallium experiment will be to set up
an initial rotation proﬁle that is stable to the Taylor-Couette instability (TCI) while unstable to the magnetorota-
tional instability (MRI) when an appropriate magnetic ﬁeld is applied. It is found experimentally that the azimuthal
ﬂow vϕ(r) is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in an inﬁnitely long circular Couette system. In order to understand
the underlying physics, numerical simulations have been performed using the same boundary conditions as in the
experiment. The measured proﬁle of vϕ is successfully reproduced by the simulations, which show a strong poloidal
circulation driven by boundary layers at the endcaps. Furthermore, excellent agreement between experiment and
simulation is found for the spin-down time when the Reynolds number is scaled.

3

These agreements are rather remarkable considering that there is a factor of 300 between the Reynolds numbers
of the simulations and of the experiments, and that the simulations are performed in two dimensions, while the
experiments are three-dimensional. The suggestion is that the essential dynamics of the system do not change when
Re is raised from 3200 to about 106.

velocity of the ﬂuid well outside the boundary layer. It is known that Cf varies slowly with Re when Re is large.

Detailed analysis of the simulations show that the poloidal circulation consists of two cells. A strong radially
inward ﬂow forms near each of the endcaps in a thin boundary layer. After turning into a vertical ﬂow along the inner
cylindrical wall, these layers merge at the midplane into a jet-like, radially outward ﬂow to complete the circulation.
The existence of such a jet-like feature appears not to have been recognized previously. Dunst performed a water
experiment in short cylindrical annulus with similar condition to ours[22]. One set of ﬁve experiments by Dunst was
carried out with rigid endcaps ﬁxed to the outer cylinder. (Other experiments were done with a free upper surface.)
Dunst reported the formation of a two-cell pattern as well as a region of rigid-body rotation in the outer part of the
ﬂuid. However, there was no description of a jet between the cells. It is possible that the jet was just overlooked.
We note that although we have preliminary evidence for a jet-like ﬂow at the midplane between two cells in the
experiment, it is diﬃcult to visualize it and to measure its detailed characteristics. We also carried out simulations
in which the outer cylinder is stationary, leading presumably to TCI instabilities. It is interesting that the jet does
not form in the latter situation, which has been the main focus of experimental eﬀort in short Couette ﬂows.

We have seen that a region of rigid-body rotation occurs in the outer part of the system. This has been explained
by the tendency of the ﬂow to “adhere” to the outer cylinder and endcaps. An alternative setup of the apparatus
would be to have the caps rotate rigidly with the inner rather than the outer cylinder.
In that case, rigid-body
rotation would be expected to appear in the inner part of the ﬂow. Actually, such a ﬂuid-dynamical system has been
investigated in the literature in connection with hard disk drives for computers[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. It has been shown
in these studies that most of the ﬂuid rotates rigidly with the disks.

The poloidal circulation, and especially the jet, found in this study are an interesting phenomenon in rotating
ﬂuids. They transport angular momentum eﬃciently and reduce the free energy available for shear-driven instabilities.
Therefore, we will need to minimize this circulation in the MRI experiment.

One idea for reducing the eﬀect of endcaps is to use a tapered section[35]. Another idea is to divide the cap into
two parts: the inner one ﬁxed to the inner cylinder, and the outer one ﬁxed to the outer cylinder. Here, we expand
on the latter idea. We divide the endcaps into multiple rings that rotate independently (see Fig. 18). The angular
velocity of each ring is chosen according to its center radius and the circular Couette ﬂow.

Figure 19 shows the proﬁles of vϕ at Re = 1600 for three choices of the number of rings. The parallel contour lines
in the ﬁgure indicate that the ﬂuid is in a Taylor-Proudman state. The eﬀect of the endcaps is highly localized in
its vicinity and the poloidal circulation is suppressed almost perfectly. Without the circulation, the stationary ﬂow
in this diﬀerentially rotating system is very close to that of an inﬁnitely long, ideal circular Couette ﬂow. This is
conﬁrmed by the vϕ proﬁle at the midplane when 3 and 5 rings are used (Fig. 20).

The rings will reduce the relative velocity between the boundary and the interior ﬂow in steady state, to the point
where a turbulent boundary is unlikely (see the discussion above). This makes it more likely that the simulations
accurately predict the interior ﬂow despite their relatively low Reynolds number.

An optimization process incorporating this idea is underway to design a gallium experiment with maximum con-

trollability of the ﬂow proﬁle, yet with minimum complications to engineering and experimental operations.

We apply these equations to the boundary layer at one of the endcaps, which rotates diﬀerentially (as might be
achieved by dividing it into many rings, see

The advection-diﬀusion equation is studied via a global Lagrangian coordinate transformation.
The metric tensor of the Lagrangian coordinates couples the dynamical system theory rigorously
into the solution of this class of partial diﬀerential equations. If the ﬂow has chaotic streamlines,
the diﬀusion will dominate the solution at a critical time, which scales logarithmically with the
diﬀusivity. The subsequent rapid diﬀusive relaxation is completed on the order of a few Lyapunov
times, and it becomes more anisotropic the smaller the diﬀusivity. The local Lyapunov time of the
ﬂow is the inverse of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent. A ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent can
be expressed in terms of two convergence functions which are responsible for the spatio-temporal
complexity of both the advective and diﬀusive transports. This complexity gives a new class of

integrable ﬂow with shear, there also exist fast and slow diﬀusion. But unlike that in a chaotic
ﬂow, a large gradient of the scalar ﬁeld across the KAM surfaces can be maintained since the fast
diﬀusion in an integrable ﬂow is strictly conﬁned within the KAM surfaces.

The transport of a passive scalar φ embedded in a ﬂuid ﬂow is governed by the advection-diﬀusion equation [1],

(1)

with v(x, t) the ﬂuid velocity, ρ the ﬂuid density, and Γd =
φ the diﬀusive ﬂux. In its most primitive form, D
is just the molecular diﬀusivity which is typically a small number, giving rise to an unphysically long characteristic
diﬀusive time scale L2/D. Being a linear equation, the non-triviality of the advection-diﬀusion equation comes from
the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld v(x, t). The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the general properties of the solution to the
advection-diﬀusion equation in the case of a three dimensional chaotic ﬂow. Our method [2] is based on a global
Lagrangian coordinate transformation, which rigorously couples the dynamical system theory [3] into the solution of
the advection-diﬀusion equation. The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent and the geometry of the so-called ˆs lines play
the central roles in our theory [2], which is a distinct feature from other works in this area.

The standard treatment [4,5] of the advection-diﬀusion equation presumes a turbulent background ﬂow, the so-
called turbulent mixing problem. A method of averaging [e.g. [5]] is employed to separate the rapidly ﬂuctuating
component from the statistical mean. The eﬀect of the ﬂuctuating ﬂow component is then modeled as an eﬀective
diﬀusivity [4] leading to enhanced mixing. This approach is justiﬁed by the wide separation of the correlation scales
in the mean and the ﬂuctuating ﬂow velocity components [4–6].

Actually a smooth, non-turbulent, ﬂow with chaotic ﬂuid trajectories gives fundamentally diﬀerent solutions to
the advection-diﬀusion equation than a non-chaotic, or integrable, ﬂow. The smoothness of the ﬂow ﬁeld precludes
the method of averaging employed in the turbulent mixing theory. Existing literature on chaotic mixing largely
concerns with the ideal advection equation [D = 0 in equation (1)] whose solution is found by following the Lagrangian
trajectories, for more details see section I B. The diﬀusive eﬀect, i.e. right-hand-side of equation (1), is usually treated

as an add-on on the Lagrangian trajectory picture. For example, it has been modeled by a stochastic perturbation
to the Lagrangian trajectories [i.e. a Langevin equation], or by a Gaussian smoothing kernel on the Lagrangian
trajectories.

Most previous work [see section I B for detail] on chaotic mixing circumvents the advection-diﬀusion equation by
working with the Lagrangian description of the ﬂuid directly. This permits the utilization of dynamical system
theory, particularly the multiplicative ergodic theorem [20] and the geometrical method, which leads to new insights
unavailable in the usual Eulerian picture. A numerical solution of equation (1) using an Eulerian PDE solver has no
obvious connection with the crucial features like KAM islands, chaotic components, or Lyapunov exponents. On the
other hand, the eﬃciency and reliability of numerical PDE solvers for following the global solution for a long time
requires an understanding of the properties of the solution and the features that deﬁne the range of validity of the
numerical scheme. This is the primary motivation for our previous work in the two dimensional case and the current
treatment for the three dimensional case.

The basic diﬀerence between our approach and those reviewed in section I B is that we directly solve the advection-
diﬀusion equation including the eﬀects of a ﬁnite diﬀusivity. The need to keep the diﬀusion term, despite the smallness
of D, will become obvious once we obtain the full solution. The most obvious requirement for keeping a small D comes
from the time for diﬀusion [the right-hand side of equation (1)] to dominate the solution, which has a logarithmic
dependence on D. In a general context, the diﬀusion term is a singular perturbation to the pure advection equation.
Mathematically it changes the characteristics, or type, of the underlying PDE. Physically it is responsible for removing
the time reversibility of the physical process. This can be quantitatively explained by examining the mean variance
of the passive scalar φ,

(φ2/2)d3x.

For a bounded system, it is straightforward to show that the entropy-like quantity S would increase or saturate only
if D does not vanish, see equation (11).

In the next section we will brieﬂy review some related work on chaotic mixing, ranging from chaotic advection,
hamiltonian transport theory, to fractional kinetic theory. Neither the list of topics nor the literature cited can be
exhaustive, but they give a reasonable perspective for contrasting our approach and results. For those familiar with
the literature, section I B can be skipped in its entirety.

B. A brief review of related work

As one of the primary physical applications of the chaos theory, it was recognized [7] in the eighties that smooth
(laminar) ﬂow could also lead to eﬃcient mixing, as long as the ﬂow trajectories are non-integrable or chaotic [for a
sampling of experimental work, see [8,9]]. Despite the variants in name (chaotic advection or Lagrangian turbulence
[7], hamiltonian transport theory [10], and fractional kinetic theory [11]), these treatments make the same assumption
of ignoring the right-hand-side (diﬀusion) term in equation (1) and are, therefore, concerned with an ideal advection
equation:

∂φ/∂t + v(x, t)

φ = 0, or dφ/dt = 0.

· ∇

The mathematical solution to the advection equation is remarkably straightforward. Since the passive scalar is frozen
into the ﬂuid element, the distribution function φ at arbitrary time is found by following the trajectory of each ﬂuid
element,

(2)

(3)

dx(ξ, t)/dt = v(x, t),

with the initial condition x(ξ, t = 0) = ξ. After integrating equation (3) to obtain x(ξ, t) the solution to the ideal
advection equation is φ(x(ξ, t), t) = φ(ξ, t = 0).

Reducing the solution of the advection equation to an integration of ﬂow trajectories not only simpliﬁes the problem,
but also allows the theory of dynamical systems to be utilized for classifying the trajectories and the associated mixing
properties [23]. The crudest estimate is entirely based on topology and the intuitive criteria that ergodicity implies
good mixing. A plot of the Poincare section of the ﬂow then becomes the standard tool. For example, on the
Poincare section of a two-dimensional time-periodic ﬂow, integrable trajectories lie on topological circles (so-called
regular component, or KAM tori in hamiltonian mechanics) but non-integrable or chaotic trajectories ﬁll a ﬁnite area
(so-called irregular component). Integrable trajectories can divide the space into an inﬁnite set of ergodic subregions.
The integrable or regular, regions consist of closed lines or surfaces, so they are poor for mixing. Only chaotic regions,

2

i.e., the irregular components, occupy a ﬁnite volume, which is required for good mixing. It is still an unresolved
mathematical problem whether the irregular component occupies a ﬁnite measure. The diﬃculty lies in the fact that
numerous regular components are embedded in an irregular component and the summation of those inﬁnitely many
small regular regions may not be small. However, this subtlety is not crucial for physical applications. If one goes back
to the original advection-diﬀusion equation, any small but ﬁnite diﬀusivity would impose a cut-oﬀ for the smallest
spatial scale on which one needs to worry about the regular islands. This eﬀectively guarantees that a chaotic zone
occupies ﬁnite volume for the purpose of passive scalar transport.

Although chaotic advection and hamiltonian transport theory in principle are entirely diﬀerent subjects, they
are often mathematically equivalent. An example is a divergence-free, two-dimensional time-periodic ﬂuid ﬂow,
which is mathematically equivalent to a one and a half degree of freedom hamiltonian system. A major advance
in understanding was the discovery of the cantorus [12], an invariant curve or surface similar to an KAM surface
but with the crucial diﬀerence of its being on a cantor set. In other words, a cantorus is a KAM-like structure but
with numerous holes so it can not separate an irregular component. The trajectories ‘leak’ through the cantori in
a peculiarly orderly fashion, much like going through a revolving door, hence the name turnstile [13]. The cantori
act as practical borders partitioning one ergodic irregular component into diﬀerent subcomponents which have fast
mixing within but much slower advective transport across. Motivated by this separation of time scales, a Markov
tree model [14] was introduced to describe the slow mixing between the subcomponents separated by the cantori.
Another less eﬃcient but mathematically rigorous approach, the so-called lobe dynamics [15], generalized the idea
of turnstiles for the advective transport across the boundary set by the invariant manifolds of any hyperbolic or
normally hyperbolic sets. In eﬀect, it calculates the advective ﬂux by following the trajectories through a sequence of
“revolving doors” (turnstiles) on the otherwise closed boundaries. The boundaries are formed by the global invariant
manifolds of hyperbolic sets, so they in principle could provide an arbitrarily ﬁne partition of the space. In practice,
the lobe dynamics become exponentially complicated as time proceeds so it is usually thought to be applicable for
only a short time. The same argument also shows it is suitable for tracing initially isolated distribution but not for
following the time evolution of a spatially-extended initial distribution. The reliance on the invariant manifolds also
limits the application since their existence is not obvious for time quasi-periodic or aperiodic ﬂows.

In the same spirit as using a diﬀusion equation to model Brownian motion [16], statistical approaches have also
been advanced to model the chaotic advective transport as a diﬀusion process alone. The earliest work of this kind
was due to Rechester and Rosenbluth [17] who modeled the chaotic motion of the electrons due to stochastic magnetic
ﬁeld lines in a toroidal magnetic conﬁnement device by an eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The Rechester-Rosenbluth
diﬀusivity is unusual since it is based on a quasi-linear calculation [18] for the rate of average squared separation.
If following the standard deﬁnition [16] one ﬁnds such a diﬀusion coeﬃcient could diverge for deterministic chaotic
trajectories, the so-called super- or hyper-diﬀusion phenomena [19]. One elegant solution is due to Zaslavsky [11] who
recognized that the island-chain structure in the phase space of a hamiltonian system (also called stochastic layer)
has a fractal dimension in both space and time. Modifying the deﬁnition of diﬀusivity using fractional powers, one
can obtain a convergent diﬀusivity. The resulting Fokker-Planck equation has fractional derivatives in both time and
spatial coordinates, hence the name fractional kinetic equation. Novel as it is conceptionally , this approach has not
matured to the stage of demonstrating a practical application. Its applicability to highly chaotic ﬂows is also not
clear since the surviving islands are usually of negligible size.

C. Outline of our approach and results

The Lagrangian nature of the chaotic advection and the desire for a solution to advection-diﬀusion equation in
Eulerian frame imply the need for a method that relates the two in the presence of a small but ﬁnite diﬀusivity. A
straightforward approach would be to solve the advection-diﬀusion equation in Lagrangian coordinates, the coordinate
system directly associated with the Lagrangian description of ﬂuids. Although the Lagrangian description of a ﬂuid
ﬂow is widely known, global Lagrangian coordinates were not applied to the advection-diﬀusion problem until recently
[2]. The validity of this approach is based on the general principle that the description of a physical phenomena is
independent of the choice of the coordinate system. The solution in Lagrangian coordinates is non-trivial due to the
2 operator of the diﬀusion term and is highly anisotropic if the ﬂow is chaotic.
metric tensor, which arises in the
The metric tensor rigorously couples the solution of the advection-diﬀusion equation to the dynamical system theory.
It is also the metric tensor that bridges the Lagrangian picture and the Eulerian solution.

∇

One unique feature of the use of global Lagrangian coordinates is the ability to treat ﬂow ﬁelds that are far from
integrable and thus highly chaotic, an area where less is known but which is of great importance [23]. Although the
integrable case is rigorously treated in section VI, we will center our discussion on highly chaotic ﬂows because of
their practical importance. By deﬁnition, a ﬂow is chaotic if the distance δ between neighboring ﬂuid elements tends

diﬀusion problems, the Lyapunov time 1/λ associated with the most negative Lyapunov exponent deﬁnes a natural
characteristic time scale for a chaotic ﬂow. The characteristic diﬀusion time L2/D is determined by the diﬀusivity D
and the typical spatial scale L of the initial gradient of φ. Our previous analysis [2] illustrated that the characteristic

time and position. It was found for 2D systems that the geometry of the ﬁeld line of the ˆs∞ vector determines the
spatial variation of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent along the ˆs lines, and hence the local diﬀusive transport [2].

Mixing in a three dimensional ﬂow is clearly important for practical applications. The goal of this paper is to carry
out an explicit analysis in 3D and establish a similar level of understanding as previously achieved in 2D [2]. As we
will show, the main physics results obtained in 2D apply to 3D situations. These include the characteristic time scales
for advection and diﬀusion which are determined by the Lyapunov time and the dimensionless number Ω, and the
extreme anisotropy of the diﬀusive relaxation. Of course, the increase of spatial dimension from two to three does
introduce new subtleties in the solution, some of which will be discussed in the main text.

The main body of the paper is organized as follows. Section II gives a description of the problem and an overview
of our results, which is the minimum amount of material necessary for understanding the thesis of this paper. In
section III, the advection-diﬀusion equation is solved for a three dimensional ﬂow in natural Lagrangian coordinates.
The properties of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent and diﬀusion barriers are discussed in section IV. In section VI
transport in an integrable region of a three dimensional ﬂow is treated. Some models of chaotic ﬂows and numerical
illustrations are given in section V.

II. OVERVIEW

Chaos and its eﬀect on diﬀusive transport in a ﬂuid ﬂow can be conveniently examined using Lagrangian coordinates

[25]. The motion of a ﬂuid element is described by the diﬀerential equation

dx/dt = v(x, t).

The trajectory in real space is the solution x = x(ξ, t) with ξ = x(ξ, t = 0) the Lagrangian coordinates. The

those regions where there is a positive Lyapunov exponent, the ﬂow is said to be chaotic, otherwise it is said to be
integrable.

function of position so it gives rise to a vector ﬁeld. The ﬁeld lines of the ˆs∞ vector are called ˆs lines. It should
be pointed out that time-dependent ﬂows might not always have the middle Lyapunov exponent zero. Although
our analysis is presented in the case of λm = 0 for the sake of clarity, the more complicated case with an arbitrary
combination of positive and negative Lyapunov exponents can also be treated. In fact, a clear understanding of the
simple case makes the physics of the more complicated case transparent, for details, see appendix B.

Although the inﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents are better known in mathematics, their ﬁnite time analogies are of

greater interests in physics. The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents,

are functions of position ξ and time. We ﬁnd that the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent λs and its associated ˆs∞ vector
play the most important role in diﬀusive transport. This can be seen by transforming the advection-diﬀusion equation,
Eq. (1), into Lagrangian coordinates. For the simplicity of notation, we deﬁne

λ(ξ, t)

λs(ξ, t).

≡ −

The inverse of λ, 1/λ, is the Lyapunov time of the ﬂow. We wish to point out again that the most negative Lyapunov
exponent (λ) deﬁnes the characteristic Lyapunov time of the ﬂow for advection-diﬀusion problems.

In Lagrangian coordinates, the advection-diﬀusion equation becomes an ordinary diﬀusion equation with a tensor

diﬀusivity Dij = Dgij [2],

where ρ0(ξ) is the initial ﬂuid density proﬁle, ρ0(ξ) = ρ(ξ, t = 0). The magnitude of the gradient of φ is given by

The eﬀect of the ﬂow on the evolution of a passive scalar is, therefore, determined by the metric tensor of Lagrangian
coordinates gij. For simplicity we will assume that the initial ﬂuid density distribution ρ0(ξ) is a constant. The
diﬀusion equation, Eq. (7), can then be written in Lagrangian coordinates as

Only diﬀusion creates entropy and removes the time reversibility of the system. Even a tiny diﬀusivity D leads to an
inevitable rapid entropy production in a chaotic ﬂow. To see that, let’s substitute gij = ˆeˆe/Λl + ˆm ˆm/Λm + ˆsˆs/Λs

Since λs < 0 and λ
λs > 0, ˙s would grow exponentially in time without bound unless the diﬀusion intervenes and
quickly removes the coordinate dependence of φ along the ˆs lines. This result holds independent of the smallness of
D, as long as it does not vanish. Such a conclusion can also be obtained by examining the tensor diﬀusivity. The
eﬀective diﬀusivity along the ˆe∞ direction is negligible since

The exponential ampliﬁcation of the eﬀective diﬀusivity along the ˆs∞ direction in Lagrangian coordinates corresponds
to an exponentially growing gradient of the passive scalar in real space. It is easy to see that the diﬀusion becomes a
dominant process in a chaotic ﬂow for λt
1 regardless of how small D may be. Furthermore, the diﬀusion, once it
becomes important, is highly anisotropic.

≫

The strong anisotropy of the diﬀusion process demands care in the choice of coordinates. The rapid diﬀusion, which
occurs only along an ˆs line, can be conﬁned to one coordinate if the coordinate system is chosen appropriately. We
named such coordinate system natural Lagrangian coordinates [24] and showed how to construct them in 2D in [2].
In this paper, we give a form of natural Lagrangian coordinates in three dimensional space, which then allows us to
obtain the general properties of the solution to the advection-diﬀusion equation in a three dimensional chaotic ﬂow.
The ﬁndings agree with our earlier results in 2D [2]. In summary, the characteristic dimensionless parameter Ω for
the chaotic transport of a passive scalar is the ratio of the characteristic diﬀusion time and the Lyapunov time of the
ﬂow,

λL2/D,

Ω

≡

with L the typical spatial scale and λ the Lyapunov exponent, equation (6). If the characteristic diﬀusion time L2/D
is much longer than the Lyapunov time 1/λ of the ﬂow, i.e., Ω
1, the chaotic transport is given by ideal advection
(ln 2Ω)/2λ. The
1/2λ with ta ≡
(the scalar is carried by the ﬂuid element along its trajectory) for time less than ta −
ideal advection causes the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld to increase by a factor of Ω. Then a rapid diﬀusion occurs and
causes the ﬂattening of the gradient and associated entropy production during a relatively short interval 1/λ centered
on ta. This rapid diﬀusive relaxation occurs only along the ˆs lines, which is a special feature for chaotic ﬂows.

≫

The existence of a characteristic chaotic transport time scale ta implies that the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent
rather than the inﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent determines the chaotic transport. The spatio-temporal complexity
of the diﬀusive transport, as reﬂected in the entropy production rate per unit volume ˙s, is determined by the ﬁnite
time Lyapunov exponent λ(ξ, t). For example, the places with signiﬁcantly smaller λ(ξ, t) (hence Ω) pose barriers for
the diﬀusive transport and entropy production. It must be emphasized that once the ﬂow ﬁeld is speciﬁed, the ﬁnite
time Lyapunov exponent λ(ξ, t) is completely determined.

Numerical results suggest that the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent λ(ξ, t) of a three dimensional conservative system

can be decomposed into three parts,

where

λ(ξ, t) = ˜λ(ξ)/t + f (ξ, t)/√t + λ∞,

ˆs∞ · ∇0f (ξ, t) = 0

and λ∞ is the inﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent. The spatial dependence of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent λ(ξ, t)
is related to the geometry of the ˆs line through ˜λ by

ˆs∞ · ∇0˜λ(ξ) +

ˆs∞ = 0,

∇0 ·
where ˜λ(ξ) is a smooth function of position due to the smoothness of the vector ﬁeld ˆs∞. Hence we have, once
again, directly related the geometry of an ˆs line to the diﬀusive transport through λ(ξ, t). These new results for
three dimensional systems, equations (15,16,17), have the exactly same form as what we found for two dimensional
conservative systems [2] [of course, the number of spatial coordinates is now three in equation (17)]. Just like in 2D,
the function ˜λ in equation (15) is responsible for the description of barriers for diﬀusive transport in chaotic ﬂows
while the function f (ξ, t) characterizes the fractal nature of the chaotic advection [8,22] and the chaotic diﬀusive
transport [2].

Fast diﬀusion occurs along the ˆs lines and entropy production rate ˙s is given by the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent
λ(ξ, t). Equations (15,16,17) imply that λ(ξ, t) varies little if the ˆs line is straight (hence small
ˆs∞). But λ(ξ, t)
will have a strong variation where the ˆs line has a sharp bend. Our numerical results show that λ(ξ, t) makes a sharp

dip at the sharp bends of the ˆs lines, for an illustration, see ﬁgure 8. Small λ leads to a small Ω. Hence diﬀusive
transport is impeded on the sharp bends of the ˆs lines and a class of diﬀusion barriers is created inside the chaotic
region of the ﬂow. Our results on diﬀusion barriers in 2D chaotic ﬂows, therefore, have been reestablished in three
dimensional ﬂows.

We ﬁnd that there are also spatially separated fast diﬀusion and slow diﬀusion in an integrable region of a shear
ﬂow. The fast diﬀusion is conﬁned to the KAM surfaces only, while the slow diﬀusion occurs across the good KAM
surfaces. It is the radial direction across the nested KAM surfaces in which a signiﬁcant gradient of the scalar ﬁeld
can be maintained. For a detailed analysis, see section VI.

III. SOLVING THE ADVECTION-DIFFUSION EQUATION IN NATURAL LAGRANGIAN
COORDINATES

The tensor diﬀusivity Dgij with gij = Λ−1

m ˆm ˆm + Λ−1
s ˆsˆs is strongly anisotropic due to the chaotic nature
of the ﬂow. By introducing a set of new Lagrangian coordinates in which the large component of diﬀusion aﬀects
only one coordinate, we can simplify the computation and understand the general properties of the chaotic transport
of passive scalars. A coordinate system that has this property is called natural Lagrangian coordinates [24].

l ˆeˆe + Λ−1

In two dimensions, the metric tensor is gij = Λ−1

l ˆeˆe + Λ−1
s ˆsˆs, and the curl of ˆe∞ and ˆs∞ will be orthogonal to
themselves. That is, if we write ˆe∞ = ex ˆx + ey ˆy and ˆs∞ = sx ˆx + sy ˆy, the curls will lie along the ˆz axis. Hence
natural Lagrangian coordinates α-β can be deﬁned by ˆe∞ = a
β with Jacobian Jαβ = ab [2], using
the orthonormality of ˆe∞ and ˆs∞, ˆs∞ · ∇
choose the other coordinate β such that ˆe∞ · ∇
the ˆs∞ vector must satisfy ˆs∞ · ∇

an arbitrary point, see appendix C). The Jacobian of the α-β-ζ coordinates is Jn = 1/(f q

cases, the β coordinate gives the direction of rapid diﬀusion. Diﬀusion in the other coordinate(s) is either severally
suppressed or can not be distinguished from that in an integrable ﬂow.

The inﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent is a constant in one ergodic region. The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents,
as deﬁned in equation (5), are functions of position and time. The eigenvectors of the metric tensor ˆe, ˆm and ˆs
also depend on position and time. They converge to time independent functions of Lagrangian position, the time
asymptotic eigenvectors ˆe∞(ξ), ˆm∞(ξ) and ˆs∞(ξ), for Λ−1

example was based on a map but the solution was given in the continuous time. There are two ways to interpret this
result, neither aﬀects the essential physics. One is to regard equation (32) as the solution for a time periodic ﬂow ﬁeld
which has the form of the cat map if sampled at the periods of the ﬂow. This is justiﬁed since the map and the ﬂow
ﬁeld from which it is reduced have the same spatial dependence of the ˆs lines and ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents in
Lagrangian coordinates. In the other approach one simply interprets equation (32) as the diﬀusive relaxation for a
map by taking t at discrete time intervals. We also note that a solution of similar form to equation (32) was given in
[28] to illustrate the eﬀect of turbulent strains on the small scale variation of passive scalars.

The solution has distinct characteristic dependence in the diﬀerent coordinate directions. For Ω

φ retains its initial α dependence. For t < ta −
ln(2Ω)/2λ the solution is accurately approximated
1/2λ with ta ≡

t = ta. Despite φ retaining its initial α dependence, (∂φ/∂α)gαα(∂φ/∂α) becomes small for t greater than ta due to
the smallness of the gαα component of the metric tensor. The asymptotic form for the gradient of φ is determined

In 3D ﬂows the ˆe∞ and ˆm∞ vectors are generally mixed in natural Lagrangian coordinates α and ζ. Consequently,
diﬀusion in these two coordinate directions are dominated by the contribution from ˆm direction and they have the
characteristic time scale of an integrable ﬂow, just like the ζ dependence of φ in Eq. (32). It is the diﬀusion in the β
coordinate that distinguishes the transport of a passive scalar in a chaotic ﬂow from that in an integrable ﬂow.

The ˆs lines give the most important information for constructing the natural Lagrangian coordinate system, and
thus determine the evolution of a passive scalar. A single ˆs line generically ﬁlls a chaotic region in bounded systems.
This implies that the asymptotic (i.e., on the time scale which is much longer than the typical advection time)
evolution of the passive scalar in a generic chaotic ﬂow is diﬀerent from that of the simpliﬁed solution given earlier,
Eq. (32). That is, the ﬁnal φ distribution will not retain any coordinate dependence in the region where the ﬂow ﬁeld
t/τd) with τd = L2/D

It should be noted that the simple model based on cat map is mixing in the x-y plane and has straight ˆs lines
due to hyperbolicity. Generic ﬂows are only ergodic and can have non-hyperbolic points. In other words, generic
ﬂows can have integrable regions and their ˆs lines have a complicated geometry. The next two sections study the
additional features of the properties of the solution to the advection-diﬀusion equation which were missing from the
simple model ﬂow based on cat map.

IV. FINITE TIME LYAPUNOV EXPONENT AND BARRIERS FOR DIFFUSION

Unlike the inﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent which is a constant in one chaotic zone, the ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent for any given time λ(ξ, t0) can, and generally does, vary signiﬁcantly over space for a generic chaotic ﬂow.
The strong spatial dependence of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent produces a large spread in the time during
which diﬀusion is important. Such eﬀect can be examined both crudely and exactly, corresponding to a study of the
statistical properties and the exact spatial dependence of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent, respectively.

To understand the termination of the enhanced diﬀusive transport at a crude level, one can convolute the time
ta with the corresponding probability distribution function of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent. The probability
ln Λs(ξ, t = t0)/2t0 is approximately Gaussian
distribution of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents λ(ξ, t = t0)
with respect to variation in space, so will be the spread in time ta. Since the diﬀerence between the distribution of the
ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents and a Gaussian distribution becomes smaller as one samples the ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent at a longer time interval (larger t0), the spread in ta becomes more Gaussian-like for systems with longer
characteristic diﬀusion time scale L2/D. Furthermore, the spread in the time during which the main entropy pulse
occurs is small if the characteristic diﬀusion time is long. This is due to the fact that the standard deviation of the
distribution of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent scales as 1/√t0. Numerical illustration of these properties are given
in Figs. 2-5 in section V.

≡ −

A detailed examination of the diﬀusive transport requires the knowledge of the exact spatial-temporal dependence
of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent in a given chaotic ﬂow, especially the spatial variation of λ(ξ, t) along the ˆs
lines, since that is the line along which the rapid diﬀusive relaxation occurs. These information are given by equations
(15,16,17). In [2] we derived equations (15,16,17) for two dimensional conservative systems by applying the constraint
that the Riemann-Christoﬀel curvature tensor must vanish in a ﬂat space on which the Lagrangian coordinates are
deﬁned. A similar calculation in 3D is currently not feasible, so we instead resort to a numerical resolution.

The key to equations (15,16,17) is to show

Once this relationship is established, one can immediately see that limt→∞ ˆs∞ · ∇0λ(ξ, t)t can not have a time
dependence. Let

with ˜λ a time independent smooth function of position. Equation (35) allows a function f (ξ, t) satisfying

ˆs∞ · ∇0f (ξ, t) = 0

(36)

to be included in the decomposition of λ(ξ, t). The function f (ξ, t) is bounded by a √t dependence in equation (15).
The obvious reason is that limt→∞ f (ξ, t)/√t has to vanish to satisfy the deﬁnition limt→∞ λ(ξ, t) = λ∞. The exact
choice of √t comes from the fact that the standard deviation of the distribution of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent
over space has a 1/√t dependence. Deviation from this 1/√t dependence at ﬁnite time is captured by the weak time
dependence in f (ξ, t).

We have numerically evaluated

∆(ξ, t)

· ∇0λ0t +
for two diﬀerent models of three dimensional ﬂows, section V. Similar as what we did in [2], a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme
is avoided by expressing ∆(ξ, t) in terms of the spatial derivatives of the metric tensor, appendix E. We ﬁnd that
∆(ξ, t) converges exponentially in time to zero. The convergence rate is approximately equal to that of the ˆs vector,
i.e., twice the Lyapunov exponent, as can be seen in Fig. 6 in section V. Hence we have numerically validated
equation (34), which is the basis for equations (15,16,17).

The spatial derivative of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent along an ˆs line is proportional to the divergence of
the ˆs∞ vector. For straight segments of an ˆs line, the divergence of ˆs∞ is small, so is the variation in the ﬁnite time
Lyapunov exponent. At the sharp bends of an ˆs line, the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent makes a large swing in its
ˆs∞. Analytically speaking, the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent

∇ ·

The equations (15,16,17) have a surprisingly broad range of applications. It uncovers a direct link between the ﬁnite
time Lyapunov exponent and the ˆs∞ vector ﬁeld. (Note: ˆs∞ labels the stable direction, it is the tangent vector of the
local stable manifold if the later exists. The ˆs line is equivalent to the Lagrangian stable foliation in a general time
dependent ﬂow.) By relating geometry (ˆs lines) to a dynamical quantity (Lyapunov exponent), it provides new insights
into the understanding of chaotic systems in general and hamiltonian systems in particular [21]. The importance of
this discovery in transport study is transparent. It forms the basis for a detailed examination of diﬀusive transport in
a chaotic ﬂow. As shown in the last section, the rapid diﬀusion only occurs along the ˆs lines. According to equations
(15,16,17) the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent and hence the characteristic dimensionless parameter Ω vary little on
a segment of the ˆs lines which is straight (small
ˆs∞). Consequently the spatial gradient of the passive scalar on
a straight ˆs line segment would be wiped out by a rapid diﬀusion during a short duration. The situations are quite
diﬀerent on the two ends of this straight ˆs line segment, which are identiﬁed as the sharp bends of the ˆs line. The
ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent has a sharp variation in its magnitude at these sharp bends of the ˆs lines. Numerical
results have consistently shown a sharp drop in the magnitude of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent, see section V.
A peculiarly small λ leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in Ω, hence a form of local diﬀusion barrier is created. A simple
analogy is the temperature relaxation in a line of iron rods bound together by some plastic chips. The temperature
gradient will be removed in each iron rod very quickly but the plastic chips would serve as a practical thermal barrier
on this fast time scale. Of course, the whole system will reach to thermal equilibrium after certain time if the system
is isolated from the surroundings. The exact time scale for this to happen is given by the thermal conductivity of the
plastic chips.

∇0 ·

The existence of diﬀusion barriers associated with the sharp bends of the ˆs lines actually remedies a pathology of
the natural Lagrangian coordinates in applications. The natural Lagrangian coordinates deﬁned in last section are
intrinsically local coordinates. Natural Lagrangian coordinates are closely related to the Clebsch coordinates (see
appendix C). It is well known that the Clebsch coordinates, which are also called Euler potentials, are not generally
single-valued if one attempts to extend them over large regions [29]. However, this pathology is not as important as

10

it ﬁrst appears since the presence of local diﬀusion barriers along the ˆs line eﬀectively impose boundary conditions in
the natural Lagrangian coordinates, and hence only local coordinates are relevant for describing the chaotic transport
which has well separated time scales.

If not for the second term f (ξ, t)/√t in equation (15), the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent would be a smooth
function in space for arbitrary time. In fact, the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent becomes a fractal function of position
across the ˆs lines for large t, since f (ξ, t) develops an exponentially growing spatial gradient in time along directions
away from the ˆs∞ direction [2].

For any given time t0, this property is reﬂected in the correlation length of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent in
diﬀerent directions. The correlation length along the ˆs line is extremely long since λ is a smooth function along this
direction. Across the ˆs line, the irregularity in f (ξ, t0) overwhelms the regularity in ˜λ and the correlation length for
λ is greatly reduced. The richest structure and hence the shortest correlation length, lies along the ˆe lines. The
fractal nature of function f (ξ, t) brings another degree of complexity to the diﬀusive relaxation. That is, the entropy
production in a chaotic ﬂow is a fractal function of space and time. In retrospect, the spread in the time during which
the main entropy production pulse occurs is actually determined by f (ξ, t), since the standard deviation σ(t) of the
distribution of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents is given by

V. FLOW MODELS AND NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATION

To examine the transport problem quantitatively, one has to model the chaotic ﬂow. For simplicity, we have used

area(volume)-preserving maps to model a divergence-free ﬂow. The standard map (SM) [39]

with k a constant, is a good choice for modeling a 2D time-periodic divergence-free ﬂow. We have devised an extended
3D version of the standard map (ESM)

xn+1 = xn −
yn+1 = yn + xn+1,

with k and ∆ constants, to model a 3D divergence-free ﬂow. ESM is attractive for studying chaotic advection-diﬀusion
problem since it is a divergence-free map based on well-studied standard map and a point spirals along a KAM surface
much the same as the motion of a ﬂuid element trapped in a ﬂuid vortex.

The ABC ﬂow v = (vx, vy, vz) is another example of a three dimensional divergence-free ﬂow [30,11],

v = v and allows chaotic stream lines. The ABC ﬂow has direct relevance
It satisﬁes the Beltrami condition
in hydrodynamics since it is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equation with a forcing term F linearly proportional to
the velocity ﬁeld v [40]. To increase computational eﬃciency, we employed a discretized version of the ABC ﬂow, the
so-called ABC map [31],

∇ ×

to describe the ﬂuid motion in a three dimensional divergence-free ﬂow.

We ﬁnd that the eigenvectors of the metric tensor of the Lagrangian coordinates converge exponentially in time to
their time asymptotic limits in a chaotic region of the ﬂow. In particular, the ˆs vector converges with an exponent

xn+1 = xn + A sin zn + C cos yn mod(2π)
yn+1 = yn + B sin xn+1 + A cos zn mod(2π)
zn+1 = zn + C sin yn+1 + B cos xn+1, mod(2π)

In Fig. 2, we show the probability distribution of λ(ξ, t = t0) in a single chaotic region. This distribution is
approximately Gaussian, but deviations from the Gaussian distribution always occur. The diﬀerence between the
ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent distribution and a Gaussian distribution becomes smaller as one samples the ﬁnite

being integrable, Fig. 4. For larger t0 (compared with the Lyapunov time) the standard deviation of the distribution
of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents scales as 1/√t0, Fig. 5.

We evaluate ∆(ξ, t) deﬁned by equation (37) for both the extended standard map and the ABC map, ﬁgure 6. It
is easy to see that ∆(ξ, t) converges exponentially in time, a result that is essential to establish equations (15,16,17),
section IV. The strong spatial variation and anisotropy of f (ξ, t) in equation (15) are illustrated in ﬁgure 7. One
can see that the correlation length is remarkably long along the ˆs lines, while it is extremely short in directions
away from this orientation. The correlation length of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent along the ˆe∞ represents the
characteristic correlation length in a chaotic ﬂow. The variation of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent along an ˆs line
is examined again in ﬁgure 8. The geometry of the ˆs line is represented by the ˆe and ˆm components of the ˆs line
curvature. It is easy to see that there is a sharp dip in the magnitude of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent wherever
the ˆs line makes a sharp bend. Peculiarly small ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent leads to small local Ω number and
gives rise to eﬀective diﬀusion barriers.

VI. TRANSPORT IN AN INTEGRABLE REGION OF THE FLOW

In an integrable region of a divergence-free ﬂow, neighboring ﬂuid points separate (or converge) at most algebraically.
Consequently, the largest eigenvalue Λl (or the smallest eigenvalue Λs) of the metric tensor of the Lagrangian coor-
dinates increases (or decreases) at most algebraically. The eigenvectors of the metric tensor still have well-deﬁned
time asymptotic limits. Hence the natural Lagrangian coordinates introduced in last section are well-deﬁned in the
integrable regions of a ﬂow.

This can be illustrated by considering a divergence-free ﬂow in a bounded integrable region. If there is no null point
in the region of interest, a globally divergence-free ﬁeld admits a Hamiltonian structure [32] to which the machineries in
hamiltonian mechanics can be applied. Hence the integrable region of such a divergence-free ﬂow consists of bounded
constant “action” surfaces [33], the KAM surfaces. Parameterizing the integrable surfaces using “action” implies the
existence of an “action” function Ψ(x) such that v
= 0. Since the ﬂow is also divergence-free
Ψ = 0 with
v = 0), one can treat it as a one degree of freedom, time dependent Hamiltonian system and write the ﬂow ﬁeld
(

The Jacobian J is in general a function of all three coordinates. The angle-like variables Θ and time-like variable Φ are
periodic and we set the period to be 2π. The topology of the ﬂow trajectory on a KAM surface is simple in canonical
coordinates, and it is given by Θ = Θ0 + ι(Ψ)Φ with ι = dχ(Ψ)/dΨ the winding number of the ﬂow trajectory. By
good KAM surfaces, we mean the surfaces that have irrational winding numbers. Surfaces with a rational winding
number consist of closed lines. But a similar line can not close on itself on a good KAM surface.

Straightforward substitution shows that the transformation of Φ = ϕ + ̺, Θ = ϑ + ι̺, gives the same ﬂow ﬁeld v
in canonical form, Eq. (43). Except for the arbitrary function ̺, the Ψ-Φ(φ)-Θ(θ) coordinates are uniquely deﬁned.
This limited arbitrariness, in return, allows one to make a transformation of Φ

surface satisﬁes equation (45).

If the system is perturbed away from complete integrability, there exist remnant KAM surfaces which are parame-
terized on a discontinuous set of action. The trajectory on a KAM surface still follows equation (45) but the action
coordinate is generally on a Cantor set. P¨oschel showed that on this Cantor set, the KAM surfaces form a diﬀeren-
tiable family in the sense of Whitney so one can speak of an integrable system on a Cantor set [35]. The construction
of the metric tensor needs the Ψ derivative of the Jacobian ν0 and the rotational transform ι. By following P¨oschel,
the Ψ0 derivative of ν0 and ι can be properly deﬁned (in the sense of Whitney) on the remnant KAM surfaces. Except
for this subtlety, the results presented in the next two paragraphs on the properties of the metric tensor applies to
the remnant KAM surfaces in a perturbed system.

with the action-like variable and the angle-like variable axes. This zero shear case is equivalent to the two dimensional

integrable ﬂow with shear (ν or ι is a function of Ψ instead of a constant). The eﬀective diﬀusivity in ˆs∞ direction

D. Hence the diﬀusion across the KAM surfaces is slow. The natural Lagrangian coordinates deﬁned by equation

a generic integrable ﬂow. Since

VII. SUMMARY

The advection and diﬀusion of a passive scalar have been investigated in both chaotic and integrable ﬂows. The
characteristic time scale of a chaotic ﬂow is the Lyapunov time which measures the exponential convergence of
neighboring ﬂuid elements. The characteristic dimensionless quantity for the chaotic transport problem is the ratio
between the characteristic diﬀusion time of the scalar ﬁeld and the Lyapunov time of the ﬂow. This number is in
ln 2Ω/2λ. There
general very large. The scalar ﬁeld is purely advected by the ﬂow until the time ta −
is a rapid diﬀusion during a relatively short interval (1/λ) centered on time ta. This rapid diﬀusion occurs only along
the ﬁeld line of the ˆs∞, which deﬁnes the stable direction for the streamlines. The fast diﬀusion can be conﬁned to
one coordinate in natural Lagrangian coordinates. The rapid diﬀusion removes the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld in the
entire chaotic region.

1/2λ with ta ≡

The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent varies smoothly along an ˆs line and has sharp dips where the ˆs line makes a
sharp bend. A large reduction in λ leads to a peculiarly small Ω number. Hence the sharp bends of the ˆs line deﬁne
a class of barriers for diﬀusion. This new class of diﬀusion barriers are associated with the non-hyperbolicity of the
system, which is thought to be generic for chaotic systems [2].

≡

The characteristic time scale of an integrable ﬂow with shear is the time scale on which neighboring ﬂuid points
separate algebraically due to the shear. The characteristic dimensionless quantity for the transport of a passive scalar
in such ﬂow is the ratio between the characteristic diﬀusion time of the scalar ﬁeld and the shearing time of the ﬂow,
τd̟. If the shearing time of the ﬂow is much faster than the characteristic diﬀusion time, the scalar ﬁeld is
Ω
Ω1/3/̟. The fast diﬀusion, which is conﬁned within the KAM surfaces, removes
advected by the ﬂow until time ta ≡
the gradient of the scalar ﬁeld in the KAM surfaces after time interval ta. During the period (ta < t < 2ta), there
is an enhanced diﬀusive ﬂux (compared with the one predicted by the characteristic diﬀusion time) across the KAM
surfaces, but it is too small to remove the Ψ0 dependence. For t > 2ta, the scalar ﬁeld has only Ψ dependence, and
its decay is accurately described by the characteristic diﬀusion time. Hence, across the KAM surfaces, the diﬀusion
is distinctly slow and a large gradient of the scalar ﬁeld can be maintained.

APPENDIX A: CHAOTIC FLOW AND THE ERGODIC THEOREM OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

If a ﬂow ﬁeld is smooth, the equation of motion for the ﬂuid element, Eq. (4), can be treated as a diﬀerentiable

dynamical system to which the ergodic theorem of dynamical systems [3] can be applied.

For simplicity, we consider a steady ﬂow, dx/dt = v(x), x

3, or a time-periodic ﬂow which can be reduced to
3. We also assume that the ﬂow is time reversible. The distance between neighboring
a map, xn+1 = V(xn), xn ∈ ℜ
points at time t is related to their initial separation by dl2 = gijdξidξj, with gij the metric tensor of the Lagrangian
coordinates. The rate of the exponential divergence or convergence of neighboring trajectories is measured by the
Lyapunov exponent, λ = limt→∞(1/2t) ln(dl2/dl2
0). In vector form,

Here u speciﬁes the direction along which the initial ﬂuid points separate, i.e., ¯δ0 = δ0u.

In a single chaotic region (the region in which an ergodic measure is preserved by the time evolution of the ﬂuid
equation), the multiplicative ergodic theorem asserts that there exist three characteristic directions in which three
Lyapunov exponents reside, i.e.,

mathematical proof, see [20] and [36]. For a general discussion, see [39]. Generically, ˆei, i = 1, 2, 3, are not orthogonal
to each other. The eigenvectors of the metric tensor of the Lagrangian coordinates are orthogonal to each other, and
their time asymptotic limits are uniquely related to the characteristic directions ˆei by

In an integrable region of the ﬂow, the Lyapunov exponents vanish. But for a nontrivial ﬂow (ﬂow with shear),
there exist non-degenerate characteristic directions which are associated with the center unstable, center, and center
stable manifolds [37]. Hence the eigenvectors of the metric tensor still have well-deﬁned time asymptotic limits, but
with an algebraic convergence rate, as we showed in section VI.

APPENDIX B: ADVECTION AND DIFFUSION IN A FLOW WITH λ∞

M 6= 0

The approach presented in this paper can be applied to ﬂows with an arbitrary combination of positive and negative
Lyapunov exponents. The trajectory of a ﬂow point, which is the solution to equation dx/dt = v(x, t), is characterized
by at most three Lyapunov exponents. For a general time-dependent divergence-free ﬂow, there are always one positive
(λl > 0) and one negative (λs < 0). The middle one λm might be non-zero. If λm > 0, the eﬀective diﬀusivity in ˆm∞

Even if λm < 0, the rapid diﬀusion in a chaotic ﬂow occurs only along the ˆs line, as long as λm does not have a

FIG. 1: The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent λ is related to the largest eigenvalue of the metric tensor Λ by ln Λ = 2λt
(uptriangles). θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles of the ˆs vector, ln(dθ/dt) (downtriangles) and ln(dφ/dt)
(circles). (a) Standard map with k = 1.5, at point (0.3, 0.6); (b) Extended standard map with k = 1.5 and ∆ = √3,
at point (0.3, 0.6, 0.8).

FIG. 2: The distribution of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents along a single trajectory peaks around the inﬁnite time
Lyapunov exponent.The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents, λ(ξ, t), are evaluated at ﬁxed t. Extended standard map
with k = 3.0 and ∆ = √3, t = 20 iterations.

FIG. 3: The residue, or diﬀerence, between the distribution of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents and a Gaussian
distribution, decreases as t increases. Circles are for extended standard map with k = 10.0 and ∆2 = 3. Trian-
gles are for standard map with k = 10.0. Dashed and Solid lines are given by Residue = 0.347/√t + 0.018 and
Residue = 0.31/√t + 0.0026.

FIG. 4: The standard deviation of the distribution of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents decreases the further the
ﬂow is from being integrable (larger k). Uptriangles and circles are for extended standard map with t = 40 and 20
iterations, respectively. Downtriangles are for standard map with t = 40 iterations.

FIG. 5: The standard deviation of the distribution of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponents scales as 1/√t. Uptriangles
are for standard map with k = 10.0. Circles are for extended standard map with k = 10.0 and ∆ = √3. Dashed and
Solid lines are given by σ = 0.785/√t and σ = 0.382/√t.

FIG. 6: ∆(ξ, t)

exponentially converges to zero. Uptriangle: ∆(ξ, t) is evaluated at point
(0.3, 0.6, 0.8) for extended standard map with k = 1.5. Circles: ∆(ξ, t) is evaluated at point (0.1, 0.2, 0.75) for ABC
map with A = B = C = 1.

FIG. 7: Extended standard map with k = 2.0 and ∆ = √3. (a) The Lyapunov exponents, λ(t = 30), were sampled
with equal spacing along an ˆe line, an ˆm line and an ˆs line (all starting at (0.1,0.1,0.8)). These values are plotted
against the distance along the lines; (b) The correlation function for the Lyapunov exponents in the ˆs direction (solid),
in the ˆm direction (dashed) and in the ˆe direction (dotted).

FIG. 8: The ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent (λ), the ˆe and ˆm components of the ˆs line curvature (κe and κm), are
plotted as functions of distance along an ˆs line. The calculation was done for ABC map with A = B = C = 1. Only
the magnitudes of the curvature are used for the log-linear plots.

We investigate long time numerical simulations of the inviscid Rayleigh-Taylor instability at At-
wood number one using a boundary integral method. We are able to attain the asymptotic behavior
for the spikes predicted by Clavin & Williams[15] for which we give a simpliﬁed demonstration. In
particular we observe that the spike’s curvature evolves like t3 while the overshoot in acceleration
shows a good agreement with the suggested 1/t5 law. Moreover, we obtain consistent results for the
prefactor coeﬃcients of the asymptotic laws. Eventually we exhibit the self-similar behavior of the
interface proﬁle near the spike.

INTRODUCTION

−

The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability appears when,
under gravity, an heavy liquid is placed over a lighter
one[1]. This instability is crucial for our understanding
of diﬀerent phenomena in ﬂuid mechanics: mixing, ther-
mal convection ([2] and cited ref. herein) and also ﬁnger
number selection in splashes[3]. It is also important in
inertial conﬁnment fusion where the mass ablation pro-
vides a stabilizing eﬀect to the interface instability[4].
Without ablation, after the exponential growth of the
perturbations due to the linear RT instability, nonlin-
ear proﬁles develop through the formation of bubbles
of lighter ﬂuid rising into the heavier one and falling
spikes of the heavier liquid penetrating the lighter one.
In the general situations of viscous ﬂuids which are im-
miscible and/or have Atwood number not equal to unity
(AT = (ρh
ρl)/(ρh + ρl) with ρh and ρl being the den-
sity of the heavier and lighter ﬂuids respectively), famous
mushrooms-like structures grow for larger times[2, 5, 6].
The limit of an inviscid ﬂuid above a vacuum (AT = 1)
without surface tension plays a speciﬁc role since no sta-
bilizing eﬀects are present in the linear dynamics. Nu-
merous theoretical and numerical work have focused on
this idealized limit in order to track insights into the in-
stability itself[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. It has been shown using
a conformal mapping that a ﬁnite time singularity might
appear in the conformal plane[13] and it is also suspected
that for some suﬃciently irregular initial conditions ﬁnite
time singularities should also be observed in the physical
plane. However, starting with suﬃciently smooth initial
conditions, the asymptotic dynamics[8, 11, 12] presents
a constant velocity rising bubble separated by free falling
tiny spikes as displayed on ﬁgure 1. Although the rising
bubble motion has been described using local properties
of the ﬂow[14], the asymptotic dynamics of the spikes
is far from being well understood. The single mode ap-
proach gives a fair description of the constant velocity of
g/(3k) where g is the acceler-
the rising bubble (vb =
ation of the gravity and k the wavenumber of the per-

p

turbation) but gives only partial results for the spike[8].
The ﬂuid there obeys free fall dynamics to a good ap-
proximation and the pressure ﬁeld of the ﬂow leads to an
overshoot in the acceleration. The accelerated motion of
the liquid stretches the spike geometry and one expects
self-similar behaviour of the tip of the spikes. Recently,

an asymptotic theory using a parallel ﬂow description of
the velocity ﬁeld near the spikes has been constructed
[15]. The interface dynamics is nonlinear for large time
and can be described using the theory of characteristics
which gives rise to ﬁnite time singularity solutions. In
the case of regular dynamics a self-similar description of
the peak is obtained for large time: the maximal curva-
ture of the interface at the peak tip is found to behave
like the cubic power of time t3. Moreover, the spike po-

sition, following the free fall 1
2 gt2 at leading order, is
shown to converge to the constant acceleration g with an
5. In this let-
overshoot in acceleration decreasing like t−
ter, we present a numerical study of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability which focuses on the large time dynamics of
the spikes in order to investigate the self similar dynam-
ics predicted in [15]. We consider the dynamics for an
inviscid liquid (heavy) with an exterior ﬂuid of zero den-
sity (At = 1) and no surface tension. The numerics use a
boundary integral method (BIM later on). Due to strong
numerical instabilities, a careful treatment of the inter-
face using conformal mapping is needed as explained be-
low. The results are then shown and compared with the
theory.

ASYMPTOTIC ANALYSIS AND NUMERICAL
METHOD

We consider the two-dimensional motion of an inviscid
ﬂuid above a vacuum, subject to a negative acceleration
g. A periodic sine perturbation of the interface of wave
−
number k is implemented as initial conditions. Neglect-
ing surface tension, the equations of motion have no con-
trol parameter after rescaling the time, the position and
k3/g
the velocity potential ϕ by factors √gk, k and
respectively. The interface is described by y = α(x, t),
where y is the direction along the gravity and x orthog-
onal to it (see ﬁgure 2). The velocity ﬁeld U = (u, v)
satisﬁes the dimensionless Euler equation

p

where P (x, y, t) is the pressure, ey the non-dimensional
acceleration due to gravity and the ﬂuid density ρ = 1.
The kinetic equation for the interface reads :

with the velocity ﬁeld (u, v) evaluated at the interface
(x, α(x, t)). Starting at time t = 0 with a small sine am-
plitude interface, we observe for large time that the ﬂuid
particles located in the vicinity of the tiny spikes come
from an almost free fall from the initial interface region.
Therefore, following [15], we assume quasi-parallel steady
ﬂow for the velocity ﬁeld which gives then in the tip re-
gion

which can be solved using the methods of charasteristics

The next order terms of the expansion allow the de-
termination of the function f0(y, t) near the tip. Using
the constant value of the pressure at the interface we use

its local tangent :

Since on the interface dP (x, α(x, t), t)/dx = 0. We
develop this equation at ﬁrst non-zero order (which
will end up to be the ﬁrst order in x) with the ex-
pansion θ(xt) = θ(0) + x2t2θ′′(0)/2 + O(x4). Re-

The numerical method is elaborated using the incom-
pressible and potential properties of the ﬂow. The veloc-
ity ﬁeld can thus be evaluated everywhere when the veloc-
ity potential is known on the interface thanks to Cauchy’s
theorem, in the spirit of pionnering works[16, 17, 18, 19].

Knowing ϕ on the free surface at a given time-step, we
search for the solution of equation (4) that satisﬁes this
boundary condition (5). We use the complex potential
β(z) = ϕ + iψ and the conformal map f (z) = exp(
iz)
(Cf. Figure 2), where z = x + iy and ψ is the stream
function. The conformal map transforms the periodic
domain Ω into the closed domain M . Since ψ is harmonic
inside Ω, β(z) is analytic inside Ω and therefore γ(ζ) =
β(f (z)) is analytic inside M . Using Cauchy’s theorem,
we obtain a Fredholm equation of the second kind for the
stream function ψ which is solved using discretization of
the free surface (∂Ω and thus ∂M ). This linear system
of equations is solved using a LU decomposition. Once
we know ψ on each point on ∂M , the complex velocity
of each marker in the physical plane is given by :

where u and v are the horizontal and vertical velocities
respectively. This complex velocity is computed with a
ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme using the values of the complex
potential on the collocation points on ∂Ω. The posi-
tion of the surface markers (kinematic condition) and the
value of the velocity potential on each of these markers
(Bernoulli equation) are then updated in time using a
fourth order Runge-Kutta method.

sine-mode. The unavoidable numerical noise cannot be
damped by the numerics and the calculations always end
up subject to numerical instabilities. Nevertheless, we
emphasize that the numerical scheme used here is re-
markably robust and can be accurately evolved to reach
the large time where the scalings predicted by the theory
[15] are valid. Comparing our simulations with recent
numerical works[5, 6, 9], we have been able to run the
dynamics at least twice as far which corresponds roughly
to an increase of a factor of 8 in the tip’s curvature.

The position of the spike is shown on ﬁgure 3 as
function of time. We observe that the asymptotics
dynamics are very well approximated by the relation
ys = 1
t0)2 as shown in the inset to the ﬁgure with
t0 = 3.74. This remarkable behavior, in good agreement
with the free fall hypothesis, suggests that t0 is the time
delay accounting for the initial exponential development
of the instability. We will therefore present further data
on the curvature dependance and the acceleration of the
tip as functions of this delayed time t
t0 instead of t.
The curvature κs at the tip is then shown on ﬁgure 4.

ﬁnite diﬀerences on the tip velocity and the overshoot in
the acceleration is presented on ﬁgure 5. We observe that
the results look noisier than the two previous ones. Two
factors can explain such noise: ﬁrstly, we are looking to
a ﬁnite diﬀerence which decreases to zero so that the nu-
merical errors are relatively more important. However,
we note that the overshoot in acceleration shows a good
agreement with the 1/t5 law, noting that no adjustable
parameter is used in this comparison. Moreover, the self

FIG. 6: Self-similar structure of the tip: the interface proﬁle
around the spike have been superimposed on the right side
of the ﬁgure for diﬀerent time t ranging from 4 to 12. The
left side of the ﬁgure shows the same curves rescaled by factor
1/(t − t0) and (t − t0) for the x and y coordinates respectively,
following the scaling behavior predicted by the theory.

We have thus exhibited large times numerical simu-
lations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability which present
asymptotic scaling behavior in agreement with theoret-
ical predictions using Taylor expansions of the free fall
velocity ﬁeld at the spike[15]. Although our numerics al-
ways stops due to numerical instability, we have been able
to reach large time enough to exhibit the cubic power in
time dependance for the spike curvature and the inverse
of the quintinc power of time decreasing of the overshoot
in acceleration.

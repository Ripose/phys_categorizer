Let the interface between two immiscible ﬂuids in a Hele-Shaw cell have, at t = 0, a wedge
shape. As a wedge is scale-free, the ﬂuid relaxation dynamics are self-similar. We ﬁnd the dynamic
exponent of this self-similar ﬂow and show that the interface shape is given by the solution of an
unusual inverse problem of potential theory. We solve this problem analytically for an almost ﬂat
wedge, and numerically otherwise. The wedge solution is useful for analysis of pinch-oﬀ singularities.

Introduction. Interface dynamics between two immis-
cible ﬂuids in a Hele-Shaw cell have attracted a great
interest in the last two decades. Most of the eﬀorts have
dealt with forced ﬂows, when a more viscous ﬂuid is dis-
placed by a less viscous ﬂuid.
In the forced case the
viscous ﬁngering instability [1, 2] develops and brings
about intricate issues of pattern selection in a channel
geometry [3, 4, 5], development of fractal structure in a
radial geometry [6], etc. The role of small surface tension
in the theory of a forced Hele-Shaw ﬂow is to introduce
regularization on small scales. This Letter deals with an
unforced Hele-Shaw (UHS) ﬂow [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], where
surface tension at the ﬂuid interface is the only driv-
ing factor. The pertinent free boundary problem here is
non-integrable and, because of its non-locality, hard for
analysis. To our knowledge, the only known analytical
solutions to this class of problems are (i) a linear analy-
sis of the dynamics of a slightly deformed ﬂat or circular
interface [1, 2] and (ii) a recent asymptotic scaling anal-
ysis of the dynamics of a long stripe of an inviscid ﬂuid
trapped in a viscous ﬂuid [11]. To get more insight into
the physics of UHS ﬂows, we address here the case when
one of the ﬂuids at t = 0 has the form of a wedge. In
this case the ﬂow is self-similar. Building on this simpli-
ﬁcation, we recast the problem into an unusual inverse
problem of potential theory. We solve this problem an-
alytically for an almost ﬂat wedge and numerically for
several other wedge angles. Finally, we use a wedge so-
lution for analysis of pinch-oﬀ events of the UHS ﬂow,
which has attracted much interest in theory and experi-
ment [8, 9].

Governing equations and self-similarity. Let one of the
ﬂuids have a negligible viscosity, so that the pressure in-
side this ﬂuid is constant and can be taken zero. The ve-
locity of the viscous ﬂuid is v (r, t) = −(b2/12µ) ∇p (r, t),
where p is the pressure, µ is the dynamic viscosity, and
b is the plate spacing [1, 2, 3]. Therefore, the interface
speed is

vn = −(b2/12µ)∂np ,

(1)

where index n denotes the components of the vectors
normal to the interface outwards, and ∂np is evaluated
at the respective points of the interface γ. As ∇ · v = 0

in the (incompressible) viscous ﬂuid, the pressure there
is a harmonic function:

The Gibbs-Thomson relation at the interface yields

∇2p = 0 .

p |γ = (π/4) σK ,

where σ is surface tension, and K is the local curvature of
the interface, positive when the inviscid region is convex
outwards. As the ﬂow is undriven we demand

∂np = 0 at r → ∞ .

We assume that the interface has the form of a graph
y = y(x, t) and rewrite Eq. (1) as an evolution equation:

∂ty(x, t) = −(b2/12µ) ∂np

1 + (∂xy)2

= (b2/12µ) [∂xy(x, t) ∂xp − ∂yp] ,

p

(5)

where the derivatives of p are evaluated at the interface.
At t = 0 the inviscid ﬂuid has the form of a wedge of
angle α, so that y = −|x| cot (α/2), see Fig. 1. As this
initial condition and Eqs. (2)-(5) do not introduce any
length scale, the solution must be self-similar [12]. Let
L(t) be the retreat distance of the wedge tip. Then the
interface position and the pressure in the viscous ﬂuid

can be written as

Keeping only leading terms, we can rewrite the boundary
conditions (8) and (9) for the harmonic function U (ξ, η)
in the following form:

U [ξ, εψ(ξ)] = ψ′′(ξ) ,

∂ηU [ξ, εψ(ξ)] = Λ [ξψ′(ξ) − ψ(ξ)] ,

respectively. We ﬁx the coordinates by choosing y(x =
0, t) = −L(t), that is Φ(0) = −1. In the rescaled coordi-
nates X = x/L(t) and Y = y/L(t) the Laplace’s equation
(2) keeps its form, while Eq. (3) becomes

where

where primes stand for X-derivatives. Now, using Eqs.

where the derivatives of P are evaluated at the rescaled
interface Φ(X), L(t) =
, and λ is an
unknown dimensionless parameter. The boundary con-
ditions are Φ(0) = −1, Φ′(0) = 0 and Φ(X → ±∞) =
−|X| cot (α/2). Note that we have already found the dy-
namic scaling exponent 1/3: the same as observed in the
relaxation of fractal viscous ﬁngering patterns [9, 10].
The shape function Φ(X) (and the parameter λ) for a
given wedge angle α is determined by the solution of
the following (quite unusual) inverse problem of poten-
tial theory. A harmonic function P (X, Y ) must obey both
(8)], and a Neu-
a Dirichlet boundary condition [Eq.
mann boundary condition [Eq. (9)], while the function
Φ(X) must be determined from the demand that these
two conditions be consistent. We solved this problem an-
alytically for an almost ﬂat wedge, and numerically oth-
erwise. Before reporting the analytic solution, we present
a large-X asymptote of Φ(X), valid for any wedge an-
gle. It corresponds to the leading term of the multipole
expansion of P (X, Y ) at large distances. Introduce, for
a moment, polar coordinates r, φ with the origin at the
point X = Y = 0 and measure the polar angle φ from the
ray Y = −X cot (α/2) counterclockwise. At large |X| the
curve Y = Φ(X) is almost ﬂat, so P [X, Φ(X)] → 0 there
by virtue of Eq. (8). Therefore, the leading term of the
multipole expansion is P (r ≫ 1, φ) = const r−ν sin(νφ),
where ν = (2 − α/π)−1 [13]. Now we employ Eq. (9) and
obtain, at |X| ≫ 1,

Φ(X) = −|X| cot (α/2) + C |X|−

3π−α
2π−α + . . . ,

(10)

with an unknown constant C that depends only on α.

Almost ﬂat wedge. Let us assume that π − α ≪ π,
and introduce the small parameter ε ≡ cot(α/2) ≪ 1.
We rescale the variables: X = ξ/ε, Y = η/ε, P (X, Y ) =
ε2 U (ξ, η) and λ = Λε3.
In the rescaled varaibles the
interface equation is η = εψ(ξ), where ψ(ξ) ≡ Φ(ξ/ε).

(14)

(15)

ψ(0) = −1, ψ′(0) = 0, ψ(ξ → ±∞) = −|ξ| + o(1) . (13)

The rescaled problem does not include ε, except in the
second argument of the functions on the left hand side
of Eqs. (11) and (12). In view of the condition ψ(ξ →
±∞) = −|ξ| one cannot put the second argument to zero
at suﬃciently large |ξ|. As will be shown below, these
values of ξ are exponentially large in ε−1, while at shorter
distances one can safely put the second argument to zero.
The problem obtained in this way is soluble exactly.
Assume ψ(ξ) is known. Then one can easily ﬁnd the
harmonic function in the upper half-plane η > 0, that
satisﬁes the Dirichlet condition u(ξ, 0) = ψ′′(ξ) on the
ξ-axis:

U (ξ, η) =

Now we should impose the Neumann condition (12)
(where we put ε = 0). To avoid calculation of hyper-
singular integrals, we ﬁnd the harmonic conjugate

V (ξ, η) =

(ξ − s)ψ′′(s) ds
(ξ − s)2 + η2

and, by virtue of the Cauchy-Riemann conditions, replace
∂ηU (ξ, 0) by −∂ξV (ξ, 0). This yields a non-standard
integro-diﬀerential equation

nate the oﬀset O(1) we put Λ = (8/3) π−3[Γ(2/3)]3 =

0.213545 . . .. Though the integrals in Eqs.
(18) can be expressed via the generalized hypergeomet-
ric function pFq(a; b; z), it is more convenient to keep the
integral form [15]. To complete the solution, we ﬁnd the
rescaled pressure:

Now we ﬁnd the distance |ξ| = l(ε) ≫ 1 at which the
solution (18) becomes inaccurate, and improve the large-
|ξ| asymptote. Let us compare Eq. (19), which becomes

ψ(ξ) = −|ξ| +

with the large-|ξ| multipole asymptote (10):

ψ(ξ) = −|ξ| + C(ε) |ξ/ε|−

2π−α ,

|ξ| ≫ 1 .

(22)

where, for small ε, −(3π − α)/(2π − α) ≃ −2 + 2ε/π .
We see that the last term in Eq. (21) lacks the small
correction 2ε/π in the exponent of ξ. We can match the
two asymptotes (21) and (22) in their common region of
validity 1 ≪ |ξ| ≪ l(ε). We deﬁne l(ε) as the value of |ξ|
for which the correction to the exponent yields a factor e:
l(ε) = eπ/(2ε) [notice that, at |ξ| ∼ l(ε), the deviation of
ψ(ξ) from its ﬂat asymptote −|ξ| is already exponentially
small: ∼ e−π/ε]. The matching yields C(ε), and we arrive
at the improved small-ε large-|ξ| asymptote:

ψ(ξ) = −|ξ| +

So far we have dealt with inviscid ﬂuid wedges: α <
180◦. Our results, however, can be immediately extended
to viscous ﬂuid wedges: α > 180◦.

Numerical algorithm and parameters. For a general
wedge angle the shape function of the self-similar inter-
face can be found numerically. Instead of dealing with
the similarity formulation of the problem (8)-(9), we com-
puted the time-dependent relaxation of wedges of diﬀer-
ent angles, as described by (rescaled) Eqs. (1)-(4) [16].
Our numerical algorithm [17] employs a variant of the
boundary integral method for an exterior Dirichlet prob-
lem for a singly connected domain, and explicit tracking
of the contour nodes. The harmonic potential is repre-
sented as a superposition of potentials created by a dipole
distribution with an unknown density D on the contour.
D is computed from a linear integral equation [18]. Com-
puting another integral of this dipole density yields the
harmonic conjugate, whose derivative along the contour
is equal to the normal velocity of the interface.

We chose the singly connected domain to be (i) a rhom-
bus with angles 120◦ and 60◦, (ii) a square, and (iii) a

straight cross with aspect ratio 103 [16].
In this man-
ner we could exploit the 4-fold symmetry of the domains
and measure the retreat distance of the respective ver-
texes, L(t), and the rescaled interface shapes Φ(X) for
four wedge angles: 120◦, 90◦, 60◦ and 270◦, the latter one
corresponding to a 90◦ wedge of the viscous ﬂuid. The
ultimate shapes of the rhombus- and square-shaped do-
mains are perfect circles. Therefore, to observe the self-
similar asymptotics we did the measurements at times
much shorter than the characteristic time of relaxation
toward a circle, and at distances much smaller than the
domain size (so that the eﬀect of the other vertexes could
be neglected). For the rhombus and square an equidis-
tant grid with 901 nodes per side was employed. For
the quarter of the cross we used 2801 nodes. The time
step was taken to be 10−3 times the maximum of the
ratio of the interface curvature radius and the interface
speed at the same node. The domain area conservation
was used for accuracy control. For the measurements
reported here the area was conserved with an accuracy
better than 10−3%.

Numerical results. We ﬁrst report the results for the
three viscous ﬂuid wedges. Figure 2 shows the retreat
distance L(t) for the angles 120◦, 90◦, and 60◦. Power
law ﬁts yield L(t) = 0.48 t0.33, 0.84 t0.33, and 1.33 t0.33,
respectively, so the dynamic exponent 1/3 is clearly ob-
served.
In the rescaled units, used in the simulations
[16], the analytical prediction for an almost ﬂat wedge
is L(t) = at1/3, where a = (3Λ)1/3ε ≃ 0.862 ε. For
α = 120◦ and 90◦ this yields a ≃ 0.498 and a = 0.862,
respectively, in very good agreement with the measured
values 0.48 and 0.84. Even for α = 60◦ the analytical pre-
diction, a = 1.493, is only 12% higher than the measured
value 1.33.

The rescaled shapes of the three evolving wedges are
depicted in Fig. 3. That the curves, measured at three
diﬀerent times, collapse into a single curve proves self-
similarity. The prediction of our almost-ﬂat-wedge the-
ory, shown on the same three graphs, works very well for
α = 120◦ and 90◦, and fairly well even for 60◦.

We also measured, for each of the three values of the

of β = 90◦ is shown in Fig. 4, where the retreat distance,
the shape function and the pinch-oﬀ time are taken from
the previously described simulation of the cross-shaped
domain with aspect ratio 103.

Summary. We have studied analytically and numeri-
cally the surface tension driven ﬂow of a ﬂuid wedge in
a Hele-Shaw cell. We have shown that the ﬂuid inter-
face evolves self-similarly, found the asymptotic interface
shape at large distances, and recast the problem into an
unusual inverse problem of potential theory. We solved
this inverse problem analytically in the limit of nearly
ﬂat wedge, and performed numerical simulation which
support and extend the analytic calculations. Like in the
case of self-similar solutions, obtained for wedge-like ini-
tial conditions in other surface tension driven ﬂows [19],
this solution provides a sharp characterization of the UHS
ﬂow. It also sheds a new light on the pinch-oﬀ singulari-
ties of this ﬂow.

between Φ(X) and Y = −|X| cot α/2). The results are
in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction,
given by the last term in Eq. (10).

Pinch-oﬀs. The self-similar wedge solutions are useful
for analysis of pinch-oﬀs in UHS ﬂows [8, 9]. Let the in-
viscid ﬂuid domain represent, at t = 0, an inﬁnitely long
straight branch, coming at an angle β from an inﬁnitely
long straight “trunk”. The simple physics in the inviscid
ﬂuid branch precludes interaction between the two vis-
cous ﬂuid wedges of angles β and π − β, which evolve in a
self-similar manner, causing the inviscid branch to thin,
and ultimately to pinch-oﬀ. The t1/3 law intrinsic in the
self-similar solution implies that the pinch-oﬀ time is pro-
portional to the branch thickness cubed. The interface
shape at all times prior to the pinch-oﬀ can be obtained,
with a proper rescaling, from the respective self-similar

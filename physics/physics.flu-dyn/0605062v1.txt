Non-Newtonian thin ﬁlms with normal stresses: dynamics and spreading.

The dynamics of thin ﬁlms on a horizontal solid substrate is investigated in the case of non-
Newtonian ﬂuids exhibiting normal stress diﬀerences, the rheology of which is strongly non-linear.
Two coupled equations of evolution for the thickness of the ﬁlm and the shear rate are proposed
within the lubrication approximation. This framework is applied to the motion of an advancing
contact line. The apparent dynamic contact angle is found to depend logarithmically on a lengthscale
determined solely by the rheological properties of the ﬂuid and the velocity of the contact line.

PACS numbers:

The spreading of a thin ﬂuid layer on a substrate has
received much attention due to its practical importance.
However, the motion of a contact line is still a matter of
debate (see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] for a review). Macroscop-
ically, there is a balance between viscous forces (shear
viscosity µ) and capillary forces (surface tension σ). This
results in the Cox-Voinov law [5], which relates the ap-
parent (or dynamic) contact angle θd to the velocity U
of the contact line

x being the distance to the contact line. This equa-
tion is ill-deﬁned for small x which reﬂects the diver-
gence of the viscous stresses at the contac-line [6]. The
value of the length ℓm depends on the regularising mi-
croscopic physics accounted for in the model — e.g. Van
der Waals forces [2], slip [6] or diﬀuse interface [3] —
so that macroscopic measurements can be used to probe
microscopic properties. Experiments on the spreading of
silicon oils [7] conﬁrm the model based on Van der Waals
forces [2]. However it is plausible that the relevant model
depends on the nature of both the ﬂuid and the substrate.
In applications, most ﬂuids are complex and exhibit
non-Newtonian properties. Except for some viscoelastic
ﬂuids [8], they have a nonlinear constitutive equation,
which raises a theoretical challenge [9]. Until now, lu-
brication theories were restricted to ﬂuids with no nor-
mal stresses, such as yield-stress ﬂuids [10] or shear-
thinning ﬂuids [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Shear-
thinning was even proposed as the regularising micro-
scopical mechanism [19, 20, 21]. Experimental studies
are fewer [17, 22, 23]; the more recent one [17] also con-
sidered ﬂuids for which the only non-Newtonian property
is the existence of normal stresses, for which no theoret-
ical framework was available.

In this Letter we consider the spreading of a thin layer
of ﬂuid having a constant shear viscosity µ and exhibiting
ﬁrst normal stresses diﬀerence [24] σxx − σzz = ψ(∂zv)2,

∗Electronic address: arezki.boudaoud@lps.ens.fr

σ being the stress tensor (see Fig. 1 for the geometry
and other notations).
In dilute polymeric suspensions,
the second normal stress diﬀerence σyy − σzz is negligi-
ble and the normal stress coeﬃcient ψ can be considered
as constant [24]. Within the lubrication approximation,
we propose a set of two coupled equations of evolution
(Eqs. 11-12) for the ﬁlm height and the shear rate (av-
eraged over the thickness). Then we investigate an ad-
vancing contact line (at velocity U ). In particular we de-
termine the lengthscale which replaces the microscopic
length in (1),

ℓm =

ψU
bµ

,

(2)

as a result from the existence of normal stresses, b being
a numerical constant. Thus we give more grounds to the
scaling analysis of Ref. [17].

In view of the lubrication approximation, we introduce
the aspect ratio ǫ = Z/X of the ﬁlm, Z being a typical
thickness and X the horizontal lengthscale. Let p be the
pressure ﬁeld and φ the potential of an applied body force
such as a microscopic force or gravity (then φ = ρgz, ρ
being the volumic mass). The stress balance reads

∂xσxx + ∂zσzx = ∂xφ + ∂xp
∂xσxz + ∂zσzz = ∂zφ + ∂zp

As ∂x/∂z ∼ ǫ ≪ 1, Eq. (4) yields at the lower order in ǫ
that π = p + φ − σzz is a function of x only. Then Eq.

Thus we obtain a system of PDEs for h and v. In fact,
Eq. (5) can be solved for v by a series of the form

where a0 = 0 to ensure no slip at the substrate, a1(x, t) =
2s(x, t) is proportional to the mean shear rate across the
thickness, a2 = ∂x(−π + 4ψs2)/µ, and each following
an can be computed recursively with the x-derivatives of
the previous coeﬃcients. Here we propose to truncate the
expansion at order 2: v = 2sz + a2z2. This truncation is
further discussed in the conclusion, but it can be noted
beforehand that it is obviously exact in the standard case
of no normal stress as well as in the case of strong normal
stress where Eq. (5) shows that the velocity proﬁle is
linear in z. Then the condition of no shear stress at the
free surface ∂zv = 0 yields a second equation relating a2
to s. As a consequence Eqs. (5–7) reduce to two coupled
PDEs for the thickness h and the mean shear rate s,

where the dynamic pressure π is deﬁned by Eq. 6 and

Now we proceed to the study of a moving contact
line, the only driving forces being the capillary forces:
π = −γ∂xxh. We consider a contact line advancing at
constant velocity U towards x = −∞, i.e. h(x, t) =
h(x + U t) and s(x, t) = s(x + U t) , so that Eq. (10)
reads U + 2/3 hs = 0. Replacing s in 10 yields

This set is readily generalised to account for a third di-
rection y; s = (sx, sy) is then the vectorial mean shear:

We look for the solutions of Eq. (15) which vanish at
X = 0 and have no macroscopic curvature, i.e. H ′′ →
0 when X → +∞. Such a solution has the expansion
H(X) = (3/2)1/3X 2/3(3+X +aX 2+O(X 3)) near X = 0.
Shooting on the value of a yields the only solution with
no macroscopic curvature. It has the classical asymptotic
form H = 32/3X[ln(bX)]1/3, with b = 1.69. This solution
is depicted in Fig. 2 and allows a matching between Cox-
Voinov’s law (1) and the H ∼ X 2/3 scaling resulting from
the balance between capillarity and normal stresses near
the contact line.

To summarise, we proposed the set (11-12) of coupled
PDEs for the ﬁlm thickness and mean shear. It was ob-
tained using a truncation which is exact in both the lim-
its of no and strong normal stresses. Within this frame-
work, we showed that the rheology provides a regularising
lengthscale ℓm (Eq. 2) which is of the order of 1µm in ex-
periments [17]. Obviously the results are valid as long as

ℓm is much larger than any microscopic length such as a
slip length or the size of a precursor ﬁlm. Here, the diver-
gence of the viscous dissipation D ∼
dX/H is removed
by the H ∼ X 2/3 scaling of the ﬁlm thickness near the
contact line. The present study could be improved by a
truncation at higher order, although the robust asymp-
totics very near to and far from the contact line would
not be altered; however this would yield a formidable
numerical task as the order of the PDEs would increase

R

with the order of the truncation. Another extension is
to match the region where normal stresses balance cap-
illarity to the smaller region where microscopic physics
become important.

FALLING OF A VISCOUS JET ONTO A MOVING SURFACE

Abstract. We analyze the stationary ﬂow of a jet of Newtonian ﬂuid that is drawn by gravity
onto a moving surface. The situation is modeled by a third-order ODE on a domain of unknown
length and with an additional integral condition; by solving part of the equation explicitly we can
reformulate the problem as a ﬁrst-order ODE, again with an integral constraint. We show that there
are two ﬂow regimes, and characterize the associated regions in the three-dimensional parameter
space in terms of an easily calculable quantity. In a qualitative sense the results from the model are
found to correspond with experimental observations.

Key words. Viscous jet, moving surface, free boundary.

1. Introduction. In the ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid jet falling onto a moving surface
diﬀerent ﬂow regimes can be distinguished, as is easily observed if one pours syrup
onto a pancake (Figs 1.1 and 1.2). If the syrup is poured from a large height and
the bottle moves slowly, then the syrup thread is perfectly vertical (Fig. 1.1). If the
bottle is held closer to the pancake and moved relatively fast, however, then the ﬂow
of syrup becomes curved.

Note the diﬀerence in behavior at the touchdown point.

In the straight case,
the jet hits the surface at right angles, and a little puddle forms on the surface from
which a thicker ‘jet’ is transported away by the surface movement (Fig. 1.1). Since
the ﬂow velocity of the surface jet equals the surface velocity, conservation of mass
implies that at the touchdown point the particle velocity in the free jet is larger than
the velocity of the surface. In the curved case, however, the jet does not thicken at
touchdown, and the free jet meets the surface tangentially.

There is a large body of literature on viscous jets or sheets that impinge upon ﬁxed
surfaces, where one can observe folding of viscous sheets [9, 6], coiling of viscous jets
[7], and viscous ﬂuid buckling [3]. The fact that in these cases the surface is stationary
is essential; to our knowledge the current work is the ﬁrst study of a viscous jet that
falls upon a moving surface.

In Section 2, we construct a mathematical model of the ﬂow, where we ﬁrst con-
centrate on the curved jet of Fig. 1.2. We model the ﬂow as a thin, Newtonian jet of a
priori unknown length. In Section 3, the original system of equations is transformed
to a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation for the ﬂow velocity and two additional relations
for two unknown parameters. In Section 4, we show that in a certain parameter regime
the original system admits a unique solution, and we give a convenient characteriza-
tion of the relevant part of parameter space. In Section 5, we present the solution
algorithms for the model equations. Results for various model parameters are shown
in Section 6, and in Section 7, we discuss our results and give some conclusions.

2. Mathematical model. A thin stream of Newtonian ﬂuid with viscosity η
and density ρ is falling from the nozzle of a bottle onto a moving belt (Fig. 2.1). We
use the theory of thin jets (see e.g. [10]) and thus describe the jet as a curve. The

magnitude of the ﬂow velocity at the nozzle is vnozzle, the belt velocity is vbelt, and
the distance between the nozzle and the belt is L. The ﬂow of the ﬂuid is stationary
and the jet has a curved shape. We restrict ourselves to curves under tension and
therefore require that

In Lemma 4.1, we show that for a curved jet the ﬂow velocity increases from the
nozzle to the belt which justiﬁes (2.1).

The part of the jet between the nozzle and the belt is represented by its center
line, the curve CD in Fig. 2.2. The point C indicates the nozzle and the point D
indicates the contact with the belt. The acceleration of gravity is g and the belt
surface is perpendicular to g. We parameterize the center line by arclength s (s = 0
at C, and s = send at D). For each point on the curve we deﬁne a local orthonormal
coordinate system es(s), en(s) consisting of the tangent and normal unit vectors at
the point s. The angle between es(s) and the belt surface is Θ(s). The cross-sectional
(s), and the average velocity of the ﬂuid at this point is v(s) = v(s)es(s).
area at s is

force P (s) is obtained from the constitutive law for a Newtonian viscous ﬂuid

P (s) = ηT A

(s)v′(s).

Here ηT is the Trouton elongational viscosity, which for a Newtonian ﬂuid equals 3η
[10].

Using (2.2) and (2.4), we write the balance of momentum (2.3) in components in

the coordinate system es(s), en(s), as

v′(s) =

where µ is equal to three times the kinematic viscosity, i.e. µ = 3η/ρ.

Since system (2.5–2.6) is of second order with respect to the velocity v(s) and of
ﬁrst order with respect to the angle Θ(s), we need two boundary conditions for v(s)
and one for Θ(s). For v(s) we know the velocity of the jet at the nozzle (point C)
and the velocity at the contact with the belt (point D)

v(0) = vnozzle,
v(send) = vbelt.

Θ(send) = 0.

send

Z

Note that the length send of the jet CD is unknown. The angle Θ(s) at the contact
with the belt is zero, so

Because the length of the belt send is unknown in advance, we need an additional
condition relating send to the distance L between the nozzle and the belt

(2.10)

L =

sin Θ(s) ds.

The equations (2.5) and (2.6) together with the three boundary conditions (2.7–2.9),
and the additional condition (2.10) form the complete system for the unknowns v(s),
Θ(s) and send.

We next make the equations dimensionless. We scale the length send with respect
to µ/vbelt, reverse the direction of s, and move the origin of s to the point D, i.e.
s)/µ. The velocity v(s) is scaled with respect to the velocity of the
˜s := vbelt(send −
belt vbelt, i.e., vbelt˜v(˜s) := v(s). Also we introduce a new angle ˜Θ(˜s) := Θ(s). The

3. A ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation for the velocity. By introducing a

new variable ξ(s)

we can rewrite the equations (2.11–2.12) as

For the variable ξ(s) it is necessary to provide an initial value. To compute it, we
need to know values of v(s) and v′(s) at the same point. Because we do not know a
value of v′(s) at any point we prescribe a value of ξ(s) at s = 0,

Here we restrict ourselves to a negative initial value for ξ. Further in this section, see
(3.17) and (3.18), we explain our choice of the form for the initial value for ξ(s). The
value w is unknown in advance and is determined by the requirement that a solution
of (3.2–3.4) has to satisfy the conditions (2.16) and (2.14).

Next, we replace the material coordinate s by the time t, according to

To solve the equations (3.6) and (3.7) we multiply (3.6) by sin Θ(t) and (3.7) by

We integrate (3.14) with respect to t and use the initial condition (3.10) to obtain

Here we have to choose a correct branch of the square root (3.17). The branch with
the positive sign gives negative sin Θ(t), see (3.15), which implies an upward-sloping
jet; the physically reasonable choice is therefore the branch with the negative sign.

a solution of the original problem (2.11)-(2.16). Therefore, next we concentrate on

Summarizing the results of previous lemmas, we formulate a theorem of existence

and uniqueness of a solution to the original problem (2.11–2.16).

Theorem 4.7. There exists a solution to the problem (2.11–2.16) if and only if

(4.10)

I(0; A, vnozzle) > B.

If it exists, the solution is unique.

The theorem follows simply from Lemmas 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6.

Fig. 4.1. Surface I(0; A, vnozzle).

In Section 5, we describe two algorithms for computing I(0; A, vnozzle) as a func-
tion of A and vnozzle, resulting in the graph of Fig. 4.1. As a consequence of Theorem

10

A. HLOD, A.C.T. AARTS, AND A.A.F. VAN DE VEN, M. PELETIER

4.7, a solution to the original problem (2.11–2.16) exists only if the point (A, vnozzle, B)
is below the surface I(0; A, vnozzle).

Note: Non-existence of a curved-jet solution. When the condition (4.10)
is not satisﬁed, then there exists no solution to the curved-jet equations (2.11–2.16).
What happens to a viscous jet in this parameter range is not clear. It is possible
that a stable straight jet exists (Θ
π/2); close to the transition between existence
and non-existence the curved-jet solution becomes straight (see Fig. 6.3), supporting
this possibility. Other possibilities are coiling (in three dimensions) or buckling (in
two dimensions), possibly coexisting with a steady straight jet that is dynamically
unstable.

≡

At this moment the issue is open, in part since it is unclear which boundary
condition at the lower end of the jet best reﬂects the physical situation. We plan to
return to this question in a future publication.

5. Numerical approximation. The problem of this paper gives rise to two
slightly diﬀerent numerical questions. The ﬁrst question arises in making a phase
diagram such as Fig. 6.1: in order to distinguish between existence and non-existence
of a curved jet we need to calculate I(0; A, vnozzle) and check the existence condition
I(0; A, vnozzle) > B (4.10). The second question arises when this condition is fulﬁlled:
by Corollary 4.3 we then need to ﬁnd w > 0 such that I(w; A, vnozzle) = B, from
which v and Θ can then be determined by solving (3.20–3.21) and using (3.19).

The main diﬀerential equation (3.20) can be solved either analytically or numer-

ically, giving rise to two diﬀerent methods.

Method 1. When w = 0, it is possible to solve the problem (3.20–3.21) analyti-
cally (Appendix A). The rescaled domain size z∗ is then to be determined implicitly
from

This method only is available for the special case w = 0.

Method 2. Alternatively, one may integrate (3.20) numerically until the con-
dition v(t; 0) = vnozzle is reached. The integral I(w; A, vnozzle) can be computed
numerically as well. This method is available for all w

We solve (4.5) by the bisection method, supplemented with an upper bound on w

that follows from the estimate (4.1): since for all w,

we have

and therefore Atend(w)2 < 2/vnozzle. We thus estimate

6. Results. From Theorem 4.7 it follows that if the parameters A, B, and vnozzle
satisfy (4.10), then there exists a solution to the stationary curved-jet equations (2.5–
2.10) (or equivalently (3.20–3.23)); otherwise the jet is vertical, or a stationary solution
does not exist. Fig. 6.1 shows the region of existence of such a curved-jet solution.

Fig. 6.1. Region of existence of a solution to the original problem for B = 1, (grey region). If a
point (log A, vnozzle) is inside the grey region a curved-jet solution exists (points 1 and 2); in point
3 no such solution exists, and we conjecture that an actual jet is straight. If a point (log A, vnozzle)
is closer to the border of the grey region a shape of the jet is more vertical (point 2).

As a reference conﬁguration for the numerical experiments shown below we con-
sider syrup with viscosity η = 3.2 Pa s and density ρ = 1000 kg/m3 pouring from
2 m. The velocities of the belt and the ﬂow at the nozzle are
the height L = 2
vbelt = 0.5 m/s and vnozzle = 0.05 m/s, respectively.

Fig. 6.2 shows curves in non-dimensional parameter space (A, vnozzle, B) corre-
sponding to variation of a single (dimensional) physical parameter L, µ, vbelt, or
vnozzle. In the ﬁgure, we see that if µ or vbelt decreases, or if L or vnozzle increases, the
point (A, vnozzle, B) eventually leaves the region
.
}
Close to this transition the curved jet becomes vertical. In Fig. 6.3, we present the
shapes of the jet for speciﬁc values of the parameters along each of these curves.

(A, vnozzle, B) : I(0; A, vnozzle) > B

{

Summarizing the numerical experiments, we observe that by increasing the ﬂow
velocity at the nozzle or the distance between the belt and the nozzle the jet shape
becomes more vertical; the same is true if we decrease the velocity of the belt or
the kinematic viscosity. The jet becomes exactly vertical when the parameter point
(A, vnozzle, B) approaches the critical surface

I(0; A, vnozzle) = B

Fig. 6.2. Curves in non-dimensional parameter space (A, vnozzle, B) as we change one of the
process parameters (L, µ, vbelt, vnozzle). The grey parts of the curves below the surface I(0; A, vnozzle)
correspond to the curved jet; we conjecture that the black parts of the traces correspond to a vertical
jet. Line a: increasing L; line b: decreasing µ; line c: decreasing vbelt; and line d: increasing vnozzle.

7. Conclusions. In this paper we propose a mathematical model of the falling
of a viscous jet onto a moving surface. We assume that the jet is falling under gravity
and has a curved shape. The model consists of two diﬀerential equations, one for the
ﬂow velocity and one for the angle describing the jet’s shape. An additional relation
ﬁxes the unknown length of the jet.

The initial system of equations is partially solved and then transformed to a
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation for the velocity. By introducing an additional scalar
parameter w the problem is reformulated as an algebraic equation for w (4.5). For this
equation we formulate an existence condition (4.10) and prove uniqueness, thus giving
a complete characterization of existence and uniqueness for the original equations.
Finally, we solve the equation for w numerically and recover the solution of the original
problem.

We have shown that if the existence condition (4.10) is satisﬁed, then the shape
of the jet is curved; we conjecture that in the alternative case the jet is vertical,
but this case lies outside of the scope of this paper. Furthermore, the model shows
that the curved jet becomes more vertical when: i) the distance between the nozzle
and the surface increases, ii) the ﬂow velocity at the nozzle increases, iii) the surface
velocity decreases, or iv) the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid decreases. These results
correspond with those observed in the basic experiment described in the introduction.

Appendix. Calculation of I(0; A, vnozzle). First we calculate v(t; 0) analyti-

cally. The diﬀerential equation for v(t; 0) follows from (3.20) and (3.21),

(A.1)

v′(t; 0) =

v2(t; 0)(At + v(t; 0)),

v(0; 0) = 1.

By replacing v(t; 0) by Z(t) = 1/v(t; 0), we ﬁnd

Z ′(t)Z(t) = AZ(t)t + 1, Z(0) = 1.

(b) Varying µ.

(c) Varying vbelt.

(d) Varying vnozzle.

Fig. 6.3. The shapes of a jet for diﬀerent values of the process parameters (L, µ, vbelt, vnozzle).
The reference values for the parameters are η = 3.2 Pa s, ρ = 1000 kg/m3, L = 2 · 10−2 m, vbelt =
0.5 m/s, and vnozzle = 0.05 m/s.

We seek for a solution of (A.2) in parametric form. With the substitution

where z is a parameter, (A.2) becomes

Z(z) = z + A/2t2(z),

t′(z) = At2(z) + z,

t(1) = 0.

Here the initial condition is deduced from (A.3) by setting t(z) = 0 and Z(z) = 1.
This diﬀerential equation is known as the special Riccati equation [4, p. 4, type 4]
and has the solution

The equation (A.10) has many solutions. A correct solution z∗ is the ﬁrst solution
of (A.10) after the point α. It is convenient to search for z∗ in the interval (α, z0)
using the bisection method [5]. Here, z0 is the ﬁrst zero of v(z) according to (A.9)
after the point α.

Next, we have to ﬁnd a correct z0. Because zeros of v(z) coincide with zeros of

Abstract

Most researches on ﬂuid dynamics are mostly dedicated to obtain the so-
lutions of Navier-Stokes equation which governs ﬂuid ﬂow with particular
boundary conditions and approximations. We propose an alternative ap-
proach to deal with ﬂuid dynamics using the lagrangian. We attempt to
develop a gauge invariant lagrangian which reconstructs the Navier-Stokes
equation through the Euler-Lagrange equation. The lagrangian consists of
gauge boson ﬁeld
Aµ with appropriate content describing the ﬂuid dynamics,
i.e.
~v). An example of applying the lagrangian to the interaction
Aµ = (Φ,
of ﬂuid in a solitonic medium is also given.

1 Introduction

The ﬂuid dynamics still remains as an unsolved problem. Mathematically, a ﬂuid
ﬂow is described by the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation [1]:

∂~v
∂t

+ (~v

~▽)~v =

~▽P

µ~▽2~v ,

−

−

·

(1)

where ~v is ﬂuid velocity, P is pressure, ρ is density and µ is the coeﬃcient of viscosity.

In principle, the study of ﬂuid dynamics is focused on solving the Navier-Stokes
equation with particular boundary conditions and / or some approximations depend
on the phenomenon under consideration. Mathematically it has been known as the
boundary value problem. The most diﬃcult problem in ﬂuid dynamics is turbulence
phenomenon. In the turbulence regime, the solution for the Navier-Stoke equation
has a lot of Fourier modes, such that the solution is untrackable numerically or
analytically. It is predicted that the strong turbulence has 1010 numerical operation
[2]. This motivates us to look for another approach rather than the conventional
ones. This paper treats the ﬂuid dynamics diﬀerently than the conventional point
of view as seen in some ﬂuid dynamics textbooks.
In this approach, the ﬂuid is
described as a ﬁeld of ﬂuid buch. We use the gauge ﬁeld theory to construct a
lagrangian describing ﬂuid dynamics by borrowing the gauge principle. The Navier-
Stoke equation can be obtained from this Lagrangian as its equation of motion
through the Euler-Lagrange principles.

2 Maxwell-like equation for ideal ﬂuid

The abelian gauge theory U(1) is an electromagnetic theory that reproduces the
Maxwell equation. To build a lagrangian that is similar with the abelian gauge
theory, we should ’derive’ the Maxwell-like equation from the Navier-Stokes equation
[3]. The result can be used as a clue to construct a lagrangianan for ﬂuid that satisﬁes
gauge principle. Considering the Navier-Stokes equation Eq. (1) for an ideal and
incompressible ﬂuid,

results to develop gauge ﬁeld theory approach for ﬂuid dynamics in the next section.

The correspondences of the electromagnetism and the ideal ﬂuid can be written as
follow,

where −→B is the magnetic ﬁeld, −→E is the electric ﬁeld, −→A is the electromagnetics
vector, φ is a scalar function, −→ω is the ﬂuid vorticity, −→l
is the Lamb’s vector, ~v
is ﬂuid velocity and Φ is the scalar potential. The same as the electromagnetics
ﬁeld, we have a four vector Aµ = (φ, ~A) which can be interpreted as the four vector
for ﬂuid dynamics,
In the electromagnetics ﬁeld, the scalar and
vector potentials, φ and ~A, are auxiliary ﬁelds. On the other hand, in the ﬂuid
dynamics the scalar potential Φ = 1
2~v2 + V describes the kinetic energy of ﬂuid,
while the vector potential ~v is ﬂuid velocity. Similar to the electromagnetics ﬁeld,
the lagrangian density has the form of [4],

4 Interaction between soliton and ﬂuid

In this section we describe an idea to apply the theory described in the preceeding
section. We give an example on applying the theory to provide a consistent way for
the interaction between soliton and ﬂuid system. Soliton is a pulse-like nonlinear
wave which forms a collision with similar pulse having unchanged shape and speed
[9]. The wave equations that exhibit soliton are the KdV equation, the Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, the Sine-Gordon equation, Nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation,
the Born-Infeld equation, the Burger equation and the Boussiness equation. Con-
sidering the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon as follow:

helical protein [8]. The vibration excitation in the α

The equation is a continuum version of that describes a propagation of molecular
vibration (vibron) in α
helix
protein propagates from one group to the next because of the dipole-dipole interac-
tion between the group. The wave is called the Davidov soliton [8]. Davydov has
shown that in α
helical protein soliton can be formed by coupling the propagation
I vibrations with longitudinal phonons along spines and that such en-
of amide
tities are responsible for mechanism of energy transfer in biological system [8]. If
α
helical protein immersed in Bio-ﬂuid, then the phenomenon can be described by
the interaction of soliton with ﬂuid system. In standard technique in ﬂuid dynam-
ics, the problem will be done by solving of the Navier-Stokes equation and nonlinear
Klein-Gordon simultaneously.

In our current approach the problem is treated as follow. First, let us rewrite

Eq. (28) into four vector formalism,

In order to couple this lagrangian with the Navier-Stoke lagrangian in Eq. (19), it
is suﬃcient to replace the covariant derivative in Eq. (30) [4],

Dµφ = (∂µ + ig

Aµ)φ .

The covariant derivative is invariant under local gauge transformation[6]. Then the
interaction between soliton and ﬂuid system obeys the lagrangian,

namics for boson particle, while for static case it is similar with the Ginzburg-Landau
model for superconductor.

Thus, the solution for a homogeneous nonlinear Klein - Gordon equation is,

where A = (12γ)/λ and Λ = (12√3γ)/λ3/2. This result is depicted in Fig. 1. The
ﬁgure shows that the soliton propagation will be damped by ﬂuid. This theory also
can be applied in turbulence phenomenon [3].

5 Conclusion

We have shown an analogy between electromagnetics ﬁeld and ﬂuid dynamics using
the Maxwell-like equation for an ideal ﬂuid. The results provide a clue that we
might be able to build a gauge invariant lagrangian density, the so-called Navier-
Aµ. Then the Navier-Stokes
Stokes lagrangian in term of scalar and vector potentials
equation is obtained as its equation of motion through the Euler-lagrange principle.
The application of the theory is wide, for instance the interaction between Davydov
soliton with ﬂuid system that can be described by the lagrangian density which is
similar to quantum electrodynamics for boson particle. In the static condition, the
lagrangian density is similar with the Ginzburg-Landau lagrangian. If the ﬂuid ﬂow
is parallel with soliton propagation we also obtain the variable coeﬃcient Nonlinear
Klein-Gordon equation. Single soliton solution has been obtained in term of a
second hyperbolic function. The result showed that the present ﬂuid ﬂow will give
a damping in solitary wave propagation.

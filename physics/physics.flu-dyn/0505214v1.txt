Abstract

The displacement autocorrelation of air-ﬂuidized granular bed is measured by a novel NMR

technique of modulated gradient spin-echo. Its power spectrum together with the related spectrum

of velocity autocorrelation function lead to an empiric formula that describes the model of bead

caging by nearest neighbours that breaks out after many collisions. A ﬁt of the formula to the

measurements at diﬀerent degrees of ﬂuidization provides the parameters corresponding to the

size of bead caging, the mean collision frequency and the diﬀusion-like constant. Mean squared

displacement obtained by this formula increases proportionally to the second power of time in the

short-time ballistic regime and linearly in time in the long-time diﬀusion regime as known from

other experiments and simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Sand dunes, grain silos, building materials, catalytic beds, ﬁltration towers, riverbeds,

snowﬁelds, and many foods are granular systems consisting of large number of randomly

arranged macroscopic grains. Despite their apparent simplicity granular materials exhibit

a host of unusual behaviours, whose unravelling more often than not appears to challenge

existing wisdom of science [1, 2].

Fluidized granular bed is a system of randomly arranged, macroscopic grains in which

the driving force of motion is a container shaking or a gas ﬂow through the granules. Al-

though, these systems are of tremendous technological importance in catalysis of gas-phase

reactions, transport of powders, combustion of ores, and several other industrial processes,

we do not have an understanding of the ﬂuid state of a granular medium that is analogous

to macroscopic properties of liquids. Two particularly important aspects contribute to the

unique properties of granular materials: Thermodynamics play no role, and interactions

between the grains are dissipative, because of static friction and inelasticity of collisions.

Several theoretical eﬀorts start towards building granular ﬂuid mechanics by considering

the medium as a dense, inelastic gas with the temperature deﬁned by induced local velocity

ﬂuctuations [3, 4]. In a general sense, the velocity autocorrelation function is a key quantity

that can reveals the underlying nature of dynamical processes in a system. Its knowledge

helps to understand the macroscopic properties in terms of a single particle dynamics. In

simulation of hard-sphere ﬂuid, Alder and Wainwright [5] found a strong dependence of

velocity autocorrelation function on the density of system. Only for very low particle den-

sities, it decays exponentially with the Enskog correlation time [6], while at high density, a

negative tail appears at long times as the result of caging by adjacent beads.

Although, the experimental techniques used to study the motion of granular systems span

a wide range of approaches and sophistication, there are seldom attempts to ﬁnger into the

details of grain motion. To the best of our knowledge, only particle tracking by the positron

emission was able to glimpse directly into the velocity autocorrelation function of a ﬂuidized

granular bed [7], giving an indication of its non-Eskog decay.

The NMR gradient spin-echo is a tool that yields not only macroscopic but also micro-

scopic dynamic variables due to the relation between spin-echo attenuation and the velocity

autocorrelation function of spin bearing particles [8, 9, 10]. However, this potential of spin-

2

echo has been only partially exploited [11, 12], particularly when used for the study of

granular motion [13, 14].

In this letter, we report on the ﬁrst application of modulated gradient spin-echo (MGSE)

to measure autocorrelation spectra of ﬂuidized granular bed. MGSE is a method, in which

a repetitive train of radiofrequency (RF) pulses with interspersed magnetic ﬁeld gradient

pulses or a gradient waveform periodically modulates the spin phase, in order to attenuate

the spin-echo in proportion to the power spectrum of the spin displacement or the veloc-

ity autocorrelation, depending on an applied sequence. The spectrum is measured in the

frequency range determined by the rate of spin phase modulation, which is between a few

Hz to about 100 kHz at the present state of art. Motions in a ﬂuidized bed lies in this

frequency [15]. Generally, measurement of the autocorrelation spectrum by MGSE method

is as a low frequency complement to the non-elastic neutron scattering method with the

range above GHz frequency.

The translation of spin in the magnetic ﬁeld gradient gives the spin-echo attenuation [9,

which is an integral of two overlapping spectra: the displacement power spectrum, Iz(ω),

and the gradient spectrum

peak at the frequency ω = 2π/T .

The conventional spin-echo sequence with two gradient pulses (PGSE ) and the variant

of PGSE sequence for the spin velocity compensation [13] are unsuitable for Iz(ω) sampling,

because their spectra are dominated either by the zero-frequency lobe or by the broad-

frequency lobe [18]. However, cyclic modulations of the spin phase by a proper gradient-rf

sequence yield a spectrum of eﬀective gradient with sharp peaks. After N modulation cycles

with the period T , the spin-echo attenuation is

of the gradient spectrum with ω = n 2π

T ; Each peak has a width 2π/NT . A sequence with
proper cycling could form the gradient spectrum with a single dominant peak at ωm = 2π/T .

Such is the train of π RF pulses applied to spins in the constant magnetic ﬁeld gradient,

if the excitation π/2-RF pulse is applied a quarter of period before the sequence of π-RF

pulses that recur in the intervals of half of period, as shown in Fig.1. The resulting spin-echo

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The method was applied to a granular system made up of the 103 pharmaceutical 3-mm

oil-ﬁlled, hard plastic spherical beads with the restitution coeﬃcient 0.85 inside a cylindrical

container. The container was build from a piece of a plastic syringe tube of 26 mm length

and 23.5 mm diameter. The airﬂow through a hose of 4 mm inner diameter attached to

the syringe nozzle is used to ﬂuidize the system. Several holes of 0.5 mm diameter drilled

uniformly across the surface of the cylinder serve as the air outlets. The air pressure regulates

the degree of ﬂuidization.

The experiment was carried out on a TecMag NMR spectrometer with a 2.35 T horizontal

bore superconductive magnet. The spectrometer was equipped with the micro-imaging

accessories and the gradient system of reversed Helmholtz coils with 0.25 T/m peak magnetic

ﬁeld gradient.

The power spectrum of displacement autocorrelation was measured by the described

MGSE sequence applied to spins in the static gradient ﬁeld of 0.0625 T/m in the direction

perpendicular to the axis of cylindrical container. The axis was parallel to the static magnetic

ﬁeld. The amplitude of last echo was recorded at diﬀerent modulation periods, while keeping

the acquisition time constant, t = NT .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The MGSE measurements give Iz(ω) of air-ﬂuidized bed at diﬀerent gas pressures, as

shown in Fig.2. The spectra exhibit a clear exponential decay for the frequencies above

400Hz. The exponential decay is more distinctive for the air-ﬂow at 0.5 bar, when a fast grain

motion causes increased spin-echo attenuation at higher modulation frequencies and, thus,

ampliﬁes the high frequency range of measurement. The same eﬀect hinders the examination

below 300 Hz, because attenuation is too strong. By reducing the air-pressure to 0.25 bar,

the MGSE measurement can trace Iz(ω) below 400 Hz, yielding the frequency dependence
that passes from an exponential into a 1/ω2-dependence. Fig.3 shows the power spectrum

of the velocity autocorrelation function calculated according to Eq.4, which exhibits a lobe

similar to the power spectrum of over-damped thermal harmonic oscillators [19]. Its form is

far from the Lorentzian-type as one would expect by assuming the Enskog exponential decay

intersection with ordinate is the inter-pore diﬀusion rate in a system with inter-pore channels

and permeable walls. In that sense, the model of ballistic bead motion between successive

collisions, where many collisions are required to break out the caging by adjacent beads, is

similar to the motion in porous media. The exponential frequency dependence of Iz(ω) in

6

the high frequency range is diﬀerent from the Lorentzian form, typical for the diﬀusion in

porous media [12, 18]. In ﬂuidized granular bed, lengths of ballistic motion depend on the

random distribution of adjacent beads, which might be responsible for an exponential form

of Iz(ω) at high frequencies observed by MGSE measurement. By replacing the Lorentzian

dependence in the formula for diﬀusion in a porous media [18] by the exponential one, we

get an empirical formula

Iz(ω) =

D + hξ2iτcω2
ω2

e−τcω,

(8)

where hξ2i is the mean squared displacement of a beat within the cage, 1/τc is the mean

collision frequency of beads and D is the diﬀusion-like constant of motion between diﬀerent

cages. The curves in Fig.2 show the ﬁt of formula to the experimental data. For the air-ﬂow

at the pressure of 0.25 bar, the best ﬁt is obtained with parameters: hξ2i = 1.2×10−9 m2, τc =
0.22 ms and D = 0.47 × 10−6 m2/s, with the relative error of about 5%. The air-ﬂow at 0.5

bar gives a very clear exponential dependency with ﬁtting parameters: hξ2i = 4.4 × 10−9 m2,

and τc = 0.36 ms, but less exact D = 0.6 × 10−6 m2/s, because of attenuation cut-oﬀ at low

modulation frequencies. The maximum of the velocity autocorrelation spectrum at ω = 2/τ

is close to the collision frequency of beads as it was deﬁned in above formula. Evidently,

the maximum of the velocity autocorrelation spectrum is related to the collision frequency

of beds ωM = 2/τc.

The Fourier transform of D(ω), modelled with the above ﬁtting parameters, gives the

velocity autocorrelation function, hvz(t) vz(0)i, as shown in Fig.3B. The intersection of

hvz(t) vz(0)i with the ordinate is the mean squared velocity, which is proportional to the
temperature of the ﬂuidized bed by deﬁnition, T ≈ hv2

z (0)i. Thus, Fig.3B demonstrates an

increase of the bed temperature by about 45% as the air-ﬂow changes from 0.25 bar to 0.5

bar.

which is h∆z2(t)i ≈ 4hξ2it2/πτ 2

According to Eq.5, the empiric formula of Iz(ω) gives the mean squared displacement,
c in the short-time ballistic regime and h∆z2(t)i ≈ 2Dt in
the long-time diﬀusion regime. The optical measurements [20] and the simulations [21, 22]

provide similar time-dependence.

CONCLUSION

The velocity auto-correlation function of ﬂuidized granular system, obtained by the novel

MGSE method, agrees well with the results of simulations for hard-sphere ﬂuids in Ref.[5]

and with the simulation of ﬂuidized granular bed in Ref.[23], which reveal a breaks down

8

of the exponential decay for high densities of particles. The positron emission measurement

gave a similar spectral lobe of velocity autocorrelation power spectrum as shown in Ref.[7].

The authors interpreted it as a restriction to bead motion by walls of the experimental

cell and not as the result of bead caging within the space of adjacent colliding beads, as

follows from the analysis of our measurements. In the statistical sense, the observed expo-

nential form of the displacement power spectrum might be somehow related to the observed

exponential distribution of forces in a sheared granular bed as reported in Ref. [1].

ment of grain dynamics, and who provided the sample for our measurements.

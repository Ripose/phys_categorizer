Abstract

We develop a computational model of quantum turbulence decay employing a kinematic pre-

scription for the normal ﬂuid. We ﬁnd that after an initial transient, the length of the vortex tangle

L decreases and for large times obeys the scaling law L ≈ t−0.45. The average magnitude (along

the quantized vortices) of the superﬂuid and line-vortex velocity are close and diﬀer signiﬁcantly

from the average magnitude of the normal ﬂuid velocity.

In quantum turbulence physics [1], a tangle of quantized vortices interacts via mutual

friction forces with thermal excitations (normal ﬂuid) of the superﬂuid ground state. An

elementary research program for this multifaceted problem investigates idealized ﬂows

characterized by symmetries like homogeneity in space and/or time, as well as, isotropy.

At ﬁrst, phenomenological issues like scalings of energy spectra [2, 3], energy decay [4] and

structure functions should be established. This Letter contributes to this research program

by employing a mathematical model of decaying quantum turbulence under conditions

resembling the experiment of [4] and solving it with numerical and computational methods.

Our model consists of a dynamic equation describing the superﬂuid vortices and a kine-

matic prescription for the turbulent velocity ﬁeld.

In particular, if S(ξ, t) is the three

dimensional representation of the vortex tangle then its motion obeys the equation [5]:

dS
dt

= Vl = hVs + h×S′ × (Vn − Vs) −

h××S′ × (S′ × Vn)

where the superﬂuid velocity Vs is given by the Biot-Savart integral:

Vs(x) =

κ
4π Z

(S − x) × dS
|S − x|3

,

where t is time, x is space, κ is the quantum of circulation, Vn is the velocity of the normal
ﬂuid, ξ is the arclength along the loops, S′ = dS

kdsk is the unit tangent vector while h, h× and

h×× are constants related to mutual friction physics.

At every instant, the normal velocity is decomposed into a mean value and a ﬂuctuation

Vn = hVni + un with the ﬂuctuation un deﬁned by the following function [6]:

where M is the number of wavemodes the sum of which constitutes the velocity ﬁeld. Am,

Bm are vectors with random orientation and magnitude |Am|2 = |Bm|2 = (2/3)En(km)∆km

vector normal to both Am and Bm and km = km

where A is deﬁned by matching the two spectra at ke the “integral length scale” wavenumber.

According to the permanence of large eddies hypothesis, A remains constant during the

decay of turbulence. We observe that in the present deﬁnition of un there is no coupling

between diﬀerent modes and so there can be no energy ﬂux in wavenumber space. This is in

contrast to what happens in Navier-Stokes turbulence. In addition, the model is insuﬃcient

for capturing ﬁne normal ﬂuid eﬀects like intermittency. On the other hand, it reproduces

adequately a number of turbulence phenomenologies that relate to even order statistics like

for example the Kolmogorov scaling or the Lagrangian ﬂatness factor [7]. Moreover, since

the model was devised having homogeneous, isotropic turbulence in mind, it is suitable for

the description of the grid normal ﬂuid turbulence in the [4] experiment.

We use the symbol le for the integral scale of turbulence (peak of the spectrum) and the

symbol u′

n for the turbulence intensity.

time tvo = −(t0 − t1). As deﬁned in [8] tvo is the time when (supposedly) the turbulence

has inﬁnite energy concentrated on an integral length scale of inﬁnite wavenumber.

In

this interpretation as the energy decays the energy containing wavenumber moves towards

smaller values. Our initial conditions correspond to an intermediate turbulence state in

the decay process. We employ periodic boundary conditions for the superﬂuid tangle by

introducing image vortices. The normal ﬂow is periodic by construction.

The working ﬂuid is 4He − II and so the quantum of circulation has the value κ = 9.97 ·

10−4cm2/s. The calculation is done at T = 1.3K (compared with T = 1.5K in [4]) for which

the other parameters of the problem have the values: ν = 23.30 · 10−4cm2/s, h = 0.978,

h× = 4.0937 · 10−2 and h×× = 2.175 · 10−2. In addition, we have Ret = 5 · 103 and the initial
peak of the spectrum is located at le0 = 0.0161cm which corresponds to ke0 ≈ 62cm−1. For
comparison, lb = 0.1cm and kb = 10cm−1. We mesh the line vortices with discretization
length ∆x = lb/84 = 1.19 · 10−3cm. We use the same distance to deﬁne the smallest
resolvable wavelength in the normal ﬂuid turbulence model (eq. (3)), lco = 2.381 · 10−3cm
which corresponds to wavenumber kco = 420cm−1. Using the equations of the model we can
calculate the saturation time ts = 0.2048 · 10−2s, as well as, the time tηr at which η will

become equal to the smallest resolvable scale lco: tηr ≈ 0.025s. Beyond this time the line

vortices could develop structure at space scales smaller than the smallest normal turbulence

wavelength. At stoppage time te = 0.389s, the Kolmogorov scale is equal to 5.26·10−3cm and
therefore it is greater than the smallest resolvable wavelength equal to 2·∆x = 2.38·10−3cm.

The stoppage time Kolmogorov scale corresponds to wavenumber kηe = 190cm−1. The time

step is chosen in order to ensure that none of the (resolvable by the numerical grid) Kelvin

waves propagates more than one discretization vortex segment within one calculation step.

4

The typical time step for this is ∆t ≈ 0.3 · 10−3s. Initially, the tangle consists of 114 vortex

rings of random orientation and its total length is L0 = 14.06cm. The choice of random

initial conditions is justiﬁed for two reasons: (a) there is no experimental information about

the actual initial tangle conﬁguration which could be employed, (b) since the experimental

scalings are reproducable without an explicit control over the geometry of the initial vortices

it must be the case that the scaling phenomenology does not depend on the latter geometry.

The second point agrees with our conception of turbulence as a statistical ﬂow state that

can be achieved from a variety of initial conditions. This is equivalent to our understanding

of turbulence properties as idiosyncratic of the diﬀerential equations governing the system

and not of the initial conditions. Diﬀerent initial conditions are driven by the system to

generic (reproducable) turbulence scalings.

Other useful quantities one can calculate are the average values of the velocity magnitudes
|Vl|, |Vn|, |Vs| and |cos(θ)| = |S′ · (Vn − Vl)|/|Vn − Vl| along the vortex ﬁlaments at various

times during the system’s evolution. These averages are taken by sampling the quantities

of interest at each discretization node, and subsequently forming their arithmetic mean.

Angle θ is an important quantity in the physics of the mutual friction force per unit length:
f = ρsκd××S′ × (S′ × (Vn − Vl)) − ρsκd×S′ × (Vn − Vl). Here d× = −2.045 · 10−2 and
d×× = 4.270 · 10−2 are nondimensional coeﬃcients and ρs = 138.6 · 10−3g/cm−3 is the

superﬂuid density.

The results (hVni = 0) show that in accordance to an instability discovered by Cheng

et al [9] and elaborated mathematically by Glaberson et al [10], the normal ﬂow excites

Kelvin waves on the ﬁlaments (Fig.1). The length of the tangle reaches a maximum of

Lmax = 47.83cm at t = 0.0019s and subsequently decreases. At maximum length the

vortex line density is Λ = L/V ≈ 0.5 · 105 compared with Λ ≈ 2 · 105 for the smallest Λ

run in [4].

In stating this, we made use of the relation ω(t) = κΛ in order to deduce Λ

from their superﬂuid vorticity (ω(t)) data. Refering again to the smallest Λ run in [4], we

note that Λ varies there over 2 orders of magnitude while here only by a factor of 5. As

required (Fig.2, right), the decay of turbulent normal ﬂuid energy obeys the two previously

mentioned temporal scaling laws. Also demonstrated in the same ﬁgure (left) are the two

spatial scaling regimes in the En(k) spectrum before ts, as well as, the disappearance of

the large eddies scaling regime for subsequent times. One can ask a two fold question: (a)

why the vortex length decreases after a rapid transient and (b) why its observed temporal

scaling at large times, L ≈ t−0.45, diﬀers from the L ≈ t−1.5 one of [4]?

Possible reasons for the latter might be the inadequacy of the employed turbulence model or

the shorter decay time span of 2 decades in the calculation compared to 3 in the experiment.

In this milieu, an important question has to do with the meaning of the reported tangle

lengths in both theory and experiment in the light of the ﬁndings of [11] that the superﬂuid

tangle is a fractal. According to [12] (pg 25), the latter means that, as long as, the yardstick

for length measurements belongs to the scale range within which the tangle satisﬁes a fractal

scaling, diﬀerent yardstick lengths will give a diﬀerent length for the tangle. When it comes

to calculation, this implies that better resolved fractal tangles would be measured to posses

signiﬁcantly greater lengths when the (diﬀerent for each resolution) discretization length

is used as yardstick length. Moreover, one could ask at ﬁrst whether the second sound

measurement technique introduces (in fractal turbulent tangles) such a yardstick length

depending on the second sound wavelength/frequency. In other words, whether there exists

a certain Kelvin wave frequency above which the experimentally employed second sound

does not see the variations of the line density in a fractal vortex system. Subsequently,

whether this possible uncertainty in the length measurement aﬀects the scalings observed

during the decay of turbulence. These matters are not clear-cut issues and deserve further

6

investigation by expanding (for example) the work of [13] which calculated the motion of

one roton shot toward a single straight line vortex in the realm of interactions between a

roton and fractal vortex lines.

It is useful here to notice that in contrast to classical turbulence a uniform normal velocity

ﬁeld is not compatible with the assumption of isotropic superﬂuid turbulence and it is

not dynamically irrelevant. These are clearly seen in counterﬂow quantum turbulence

calculations [14] where the superﬂuid turbulence is due exclusively to a constant (externally

imposed) velocity ﬁeld.

In these calculations, there is anisotropy in the direction of the

imposed ﬂow. The above are reminiscent of the role of uniform, imposed, magnetic ﬁelds

in inducing anisotropies and aﬀecting the velocity spectra in hydromagnetic turbulence

(page 132 in [15] and page 100 in [16]). In order to clarify better this point we have done

two more calculations, one with stationary turbulence and another with turbulence decay

but with the addition of a constant normal velocity ﬁeld in the y direction. We have ﬁxed

the velocity magnitude |hVni| = Vny = 7cm/s so that it is comparable to the grid towing

velocity (between 5 and 200 cm/s) in [4]. Although in this way u′

n/Vny ≈ 100 (at t = 0) one

observes in Fig.3 (right) that with the imposed velocity ﬁeld the vortex length increases

at times for which (in the case of purely decaying turbulence) it decreases. Therefore, the

temporal decay law for the line-vortex length could be aﬀected by small bulk normal ﬂuid

velocities. We implicitly assume here that the mean velocity proﬁle is stable; this is also

the case in [14].

To analyze the ﬁrst leg of the previously posed question, we note that according to the

analysis of the [9, 10] instability (see also the discussion in [17]) the normal ﬂuid velocity

ﬂuctuations transfer energy to a Kelvin wave of a particular wavelength (and therefore

increase its amplitude) only when their component along the direction of motion of the

wave is both greater in magnitude than the group velocity of the wave and parallel (of

the same sign) to it. Any normal ﬂuid velocity antiparallel to a vortex wave reduces its

amplitude. Therefore since initially the turbulence intensity is approximately 100 times

the group velocity of the fastest (resolvable) Kelvin wave and there are no Kelvin waves

present, there is unhindered Kelvin wave excitation. This explains the initial rapid increase

of vortex length. Subsequently, in conjunction with the decay of turbulence intensity, at

places with wave group velocity (a) larger than the local normal ﬂuid velocity magnitude or

(b) antiparallel to the normal ﬂuid velocity direction, the wave amplitudes are damped. The

turbulence decay factor is necessary since as Fig.3 (right) shows, in stationary turbulence

the length keeps increasing rapidly.

The results for the average values of |Vl|, |Vn|, |Vs| and |cos(θ)| are presented in Fig.3

(left). They show that the initial length transient corresponds to rapid h|Vl|i and h|Vs|i

transients. The latter increases towards a maximum coinciding in time with the length

maximum while the former decreases approaching h|Vs|i. Notice that when the length

starts decreasing there is order of magnitude diﬀerence between h|Vn|i and h|Vs|i. This is

particularly true for the average of |Vs| taken over the whole volume of the ﬂuid since this

was found (using a 843 grid) to be an order of magnitude smaller than the average over the

line vortices. Another observation is that for h|Vn|i smaller than h|Vs|i (which happens at
very small normal turbulence energies) S′ tends to become normal to Vn − Vl. The results

bring forward quantum turbulence physics that diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those proposed

in [4] where the assumption was made that the superﬂuid and normal ﬂuid velocities are

identical. However, one must also bear in mind that the employed turbulence model does

not have the quality of fully dynamical Navier-Stokes calculations. The latter kind of

computations would eventually be required in order to verify the present results.

Overall, it is not possible to argue for the quality of the established mathematical models

8

in quantum turbulence theory, as long as, the available experimental data fail to address

directly the main variables (ﬂuid velocities, vortex tangle geometry) in these models. This

is a major obstacle for progress in quantum turbulence research. The present work suggests

that progress depends on the development of new, more potent experimental methods and

their combination with fully dynamic mathematical calculations. The latter could identify

generic and essential phenomenological trends that could be encoded in statistical mechanical

equations.

The linear stability analysis of the Faraday instability on a viscous ferroﬂuid in a horizontal mag-
netic ﬁeld is performed. Strong dipole-dipole interactions lead to the formation of chains elongated
in the ﬁeld direction. The formation of chains results in a qualitative new behaviour of the fer-
roﬂuid. This new behaviour is characterized by a neutral stability curve similar to that observed
earlier for Maxwell viscoelastic liquids and causes a signiﬁcant weakening of the energy dissipation
at high frequencies. In the case of a ferroﬂuid with chains in a horizontal magnetic ﬁeld, the eﬀective
viscosity is anisotropic and depends on the ﬁeld strength as well as on the wave frequency.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic ﬂuids (or ferroﬂuids) are colloidal dispersions
of single domain nanoparticles in a carrier liquid. The
fascination of ferroﬂuids stems from the combination of a
normal liquid behaviour with the sensitivity to magnetic
ﬁelds. This enables the use of magnetic ﬁelds to con-
trol the ﬂow of the ﬂuid, giving rise to a great variety of
new phenomena and to numerous technical applications1.
One of the peculiarities of ferroﬂuids is the mutual inﬂu-
ence of the microstructure and the rheological properties
of the ﬂuid. Due to strong interparticle interactions var-
ious aggregates can be formed in a ferroﬂuid2,3,4,5. On
the one hand, the formation of the aggregates changes
the eﬀective viscosity of the ﬂuid. On the other hand,
the motion of the ﬂuid inﬂuences the structure of the
aggregates.

In an applied magnetic ﬁeld chains containing several
particles are the favored form of an aggregate and are
formed by the dipolar interactions. There is a similarity
between the chains of dipoles and the macromolecular
chains in polymer solutions. In both systems a network
of chains is coupled with a viscous carrier liquid. This
viscous coupling implies, that the relaxation character of
the chain dynamics leads to a viscoelastic behaviour of
the solution. The viscoelastic behaviour is reﬂected in
a dependence of the stress tensor on the history of the
system. The theoretical treatment of the viscoelasticity
of polymer solutions is usually based on a phenomeno-
logical model. There are three well known models for
an isotropic linear viscoelastic liquid.
In the Maxwell
model a viscoelastic element is a combination of a purely
elastic spring with a purely viscous dashpot. In the Bing-
ham two-component model these elements are connected
parallel to each other, and the Jeﬀreys element is a su-
perposition of the two previous ones. A comprehensive
review of the theoretical basics and the existing models
was done by Bird in Refs. 6,7. An overview of the the-
oretical approaches to the polymer dynamics is given by
Doi and Edwards8.

A ferroﬂuid with chains in a magnetic ﬁeld is an

anisotropic system. This makes it similar to a ne-
matic liquid crystal (NLC), whose rheology can be de-
scribed by a group of models usually referred as Ericksen-
Leslie-Parody (ELP) models. The stress tensor in Refs.
9,10,11,12 involves ﬁve independent viscosity coeﬃcients,
which are scalar functions of the density and the temper-
ature. ELP models are widely used in the hydrodynamics
of NLC. These models were employed in the analysis of
a ﬂow instability13 and in studying periodic patterns14.
In these papers as well as in Refs. 15,16 the inﬂuence
of an external ﬁeld was taken into account. Readers who
are interested in a deeper insight into ELP models are re-
ferred to the books of de Gennes17 and Chandrasekhar18.
Since the susceptibility of ferroﬂuids is much higher
than that of liquid crystals, the eﬀects caused by external
ﬁeld should be more pronounced. The theoretical analy-
sis of the rheology of a colloidal suspension containing el-
lipsoidal particles in a ﬁeld was performed by Pokrovskij
in Refs. 19,20. The model gives a constitutive equation
of the ELP kind, where the viscosity coeﬃcients are ex-
pressed in terms of the parameters of the suspension and
the applied ﬁeld. Electro- and magnetorheological ﬂu-
ids present a group of suspensions, whose behaviour is
close to that of ferroﬂuids. The viscoelastic properties of
electro- end magnetorheological ﬂuids were studied ex-
perimentally in Refs. 21,22,23. Particularly it was shown
that external ﬁelds can inﬂuence the rheological response
of the ﬂuid by changing the complex shear modulus and
yield stress. Zubarev and Iskakova24 used the results of
Refs. 19,20 to obtain a constitutive equation for a fer-
roﬂuid with chains for the case of a weak ﬂow of any
kind. In the present paper the model suggested in Ref.
24 is applied to the linear stability analysis of the Faraday
instability.

The Faraday instability denotes the parametric gen-
eration of standing waves on the free surface of a ﬂuid
subjected to vertical vibrations. The study of this phe-
nomenon dates back to the observations by Faraday25 in
1831. The initially ﬂat free surface of the ﬂuid becomes
unstable at a certain intensity of the vertical vibrations
of the whole system. As a result of the instability, a

pattern of standing waves is formed at the ﬂuid surface.
The typical response is subharmonic, i.e., the wave fre-
quency is half the frequency of the excitation. A har-
monic response can be observed on a shallow ﬂuid at low
frequencies26. Faraday waves allows one to investigate
symmetry breaking phenomena in a spatially extended
nonlinear system. Therefore they experience a renewed
interest in recent years. Detailed experimental stud-
ies of the various patterns on a viscous ﬂuid have been
performed27,28,29,30,31, where a one-frequency as well as
a two-frequency forcing were applied. Among the ob-
served patters are parallel rolls27, hexagons27, a twelve-
fold quasi-pattern27, triangles28, superlattices formed by
small and large hexagons29, squares28,29,30,31, and rhom-
boid pattern31.

The comprehensive linear stability analysis of the Fara-
day instability on an arbitrarily deep layer of a viscous
non-magnetic ﬂuid has been performed by Kumar and
Tuckerman32. This analysis was tested experimentally33
and an excellent agreement between the predicted and
experimental data was found. In Refs. 26,34 the low fre-
quency region is studied particularly. Bicritical points,
where transitions from one type of response to others oc-
cur, are predicted and experimentally conﬁrmed26.
In
Ref. 35,36 an analogy between the Faraday instability
and a periodically driven version of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability is exploited. Based on that analogy in Ref.
35 a scaling law is suggested, which satisfactorily de-
scribes the behaviour of the system in a wide range of
parameters. S. Kumar36 discusses the mechanism of the
wave number selection in the Faraday instability on high-
viscous ﬂuids.

In our previous paper37, the Faraday instability on a
chain-free ferroﬂuid was studied. A nonmonotonic de-
pendence of the stability threshold on the magnetic ﬁeld
is found at high frequencies of the vibrations.
It was
revealed that the magnetic ﬁeld can be used to select
the ﬁrst unstable pattern of Faraday waves. In particu-
lar, a rhombic pattern as a superposition of two diﬀerent
oblique rolls can occur.

The Faraday instability of a viscoelastic non-magnetic
liquid was studied experimentally in Ref. 38, where a
harmonic response was detected. In Refs. 39,40,41 the
Maxwell model of viscoelastic liquid was used in the
theoretical analysis. The authors observed pronounced
changes in the neutral stability curves. Particularly, the
tongues related to the harmonic response became abnor-
mal. Such a tongue has no tip and all tongues of higher
order are inside this abnormal tongue.

The aim of the present paper is to investigate the role
of the chains in the Faraday instability on a ferroﬂuid in
a horizontal magnetic ﬁeld. The formation of the chains
leads to a dramatic increase of the magnetization relax-
ation time, changes the eﬀective viscosity of the suspen-
sion, and increases the susceptibility of the ferroﬂuid. A
number of model ferroﬂuids are investigated in a wide
range of the parameters of the system to study the rela-
tive importance of those eﬀects.

II. SYSTEM AND BASIC EQUATIONS

A. Model

A dielectric, viscous, and incompressible magnetic ﬂuid
with constant density ρ is considered, which contains par-
ticles of the equal size. The strength of the dipole-dipole
interactions is characterized by the coupling constant
ε = µ0m2/(16πR3kBT ), which is the ratio of the en-
ergy of interaction between two particles at the minimal
separation with head-to-tail orientation of their magnetic
moments to the thermal energy. Here m = 4MsπR3
0/3
is the magnetic moment of a particle, R = R0 + δ is
the hydrodynamic radius of the particle, Ms is the mag-
netization of the magnetic material, R0 is the radius of
the magnetic core of a particle, δ is the thickness of the
nonmagnetic layer, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and
T is the temperature. The interaction of a particle with
the applied ﬁeld H is measured by the Langevin param-
eter κ = µ0mH/(kBT ). In the case of a magnetic ﬂuid
with low particle volume fraction ϕ, interactions between
chains can be neglected. Assuming that the chains are
straight and rigid, Zubarev and Iskakova determined the
size distribution of chains, which minimizes the free en-
ergy of such a magnetic ﬂuid and is given by24:

where v is the volume of a particle and y = κϕ exp(ε).
Each chain containing n particles is modelled by an uni-
axial ellipsoid with semi-axes equal to nR and R. This
keeps the solid phase volume density unchanged and al-
lows one to use the results of Pokrovskij19,20. The viscous
stress tensor for a system of uniaxial ellipsoids consists
of a symmetric and antisymmetric part

mer is known due to the classical Langevin model and
the latter is the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation
(see Refs. 19,20,24). The exact solution for the case of
an arbitrary ﬁeld is unknown. Therefore, Zubarev and

where a and b

They can be found from the equations for the ﬁrst hekin
and the second heiekin moments of ψn(e), which are de-
rived from the Fokker-Planck equation19,20,24 with the
accuracy up to the linear terms with respect to the ve-
locity gradients. The moment equations for hekin and
heiekin involve two relaxation times, τ1 = 1/(2D) and
τ2 = 1/(6D), where D ∼ 1/η is the coeﬃcient of rota-
tional diﬀusion.

FIG. 1: A horizontally unbounded ferroﬂuid layer (2) is placed
in a nonmagnetic container (3) with air (1) above. The system
is subjected to a horizontal magnetic ﬁeld H0 and harmonic
vertical vibrations a(t).

B. The system

The above model is used to analyze the stability of the
free surface of a ferroﬂuid in the following setup. The
laterally inﬁnite ferroﬂuid layer of arbitrary depth d is
subjected to a homogeneous dc horizontal magnetic ﬁeld
H0 = (H0, 0, 0) and harmonic vertical vibrations (Fig. 1).
The plane z = 0 coincides with the nondeformed surface
of the ferroﬂuid. The ﬂuid layer is bounded from below
by the bottom of the nonmagnetic container and has a
free surface described by ξ(t, x, y) with air above.

Due to zero electrical conductivity of the ﬂuid, the
static form of the Maxwell equations is used for the mag-
netic ﬁeld in all three media. The ﬂuid motion is gov-
erned by the continuity equation and the conservation
law of the linear momentum

The vertical vibrations add a periodic term to the grav-
i.e., a modulated value g(t) =
ity acceleration g0,
(0, 0, −g0 − a cos(ωt)) appears in the equations of the
ﬂuid motion. Here a is the acceleration amplitude and ω
is the angular frequency of the vibrations. The governing
set of equations has to be supplemented by the boundary
conditions, which are the same as in Ref. 37.

III. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

Following the standard procedure32,43, the governing
equations and the boundary conditions have been lin-
earized in the vicinity of the nonperturbed state

u = 0,

ξ = 0, H(i) = H0,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

p0 = p(1) −

M0H0 − g(t)z ,

2

where M0 and p0 are the magnetization and the pres-
sure in the unperturbed state.
In order to construct
the linearized governing equations for the small perturba-
tions, which encompass the magnetic ﬁeld strength H1,
the pressure p1, and a nonzero velocity u of the ﬂuid, it
is necessary to expand all quantities in Taylor series.

The above deﬁned distribution functions gn and ψn
are aﬀected by the small perturbations. Since the forma-
tion and the dissociation of chains are connected with the
diﬀusion of particles in the suspension, they are rather
slow processes. It can be estimated by the Schmidt num-
ber Sc = η/(ρD0) which relates the characteristic time
for mass transport by ﬂow to the characteristic time for
mass transport by diﬀusion. For a typical ferroﬂuid the
Schmidt number is about 5 · 106 with η = 0.1 kg/(ms),
ρ = 1020 kg/m3, and the Brownian diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D0 = 2·10−11 m2/s 44. Therefore we neglect the changes
in gn caused by the perturbations. This implies that the
size distribution of chains does not depend either on the
spatial coordinates or on time. In Refs. 19,20,24 only spa-
tially homogeneous systems are considered. An extension
to the case of a spatially inhomogeneous system results
in additional convective terms in the dynamic equations
for ψn [Eq. (12) in Ref. 24]. Since these terms are of
the form (u grad) ψn,1, i.e., they are of second order with
respect to the perturbations, they can be neglected in a
linear stability analysis. As long as the typical length
scale of a chain (∼ 10−8 . . . 10−7 m) is smaller than that
of the spatial variation of the perturbations (typically
∼ 10−3 . . . 10−2 m), Zubarev’s model can be applied in
the present setup. Our results (see Sec. IV) suggest that
this condition is always fulﬁlled.

The symmetry of the system possesses a number of re-
↔
strictions on a and b
. The change of y to −y and z to
−z should not change the components ax, bxx, byy, and
bzz, whereas this transformation leads to the change of a
sign of the components ay, az, bxy, and bxz. This com-
pletes the set of the moment equations derived from the
Fokker-Planck equation19,20,24, and gives us the values of

a and b

where A1, A2, . . . , A13 are known functions of the ap-
plied magnetic ﬁeld, the frequency of the vibrations, as
well as of the parameters of the ferroﬂuid, and the equa-
tion of continuity in the form γxx + γyy + γzz = 0 has
been used. The functions Ai are obtained by means of
averaging (with function ψn(e)) over the orientations of
chains and averaging over the sizes of the chains (with
function gn).

Thus, the set of governing equation for the ﬁrst order

of the perturbations can be written:

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

Here B1 is the perturbation of the induction of the mag-
netic ﬁeld.

The linearized boundary conditions diﬀer from those
in Ref. 37 by the condition for continuation of the stress
tensor across the free surface of the ﬂuid

(8)
where ∆⊥ = ∂xx+∂yy. In contrast to the previous case37,
the ﬁrst two equations in (8) are independent of each
other.

The stability of the ﬂat surface with respect to stand-
ing waves is analyzed by using the Floquet ansatz for the
surface deformations and the z-component of the velocity

where k = (kx, ky, 0) is the wave vector, s is the growth
rate, and α is the parameter determining the type of the

response. For α = 0 the response is harmonic whereas for
α = 1/2 it is subharmonic. Expansions similar to (9b) are
made for all other small perturbations and are inserted
into the linearized governing equations (7). The functions
of the vertical coordinate in the Floquet expansion are
of the form wn(z) = Cwe±qz, where Cw is a complex
amplitude of the corresponding quantity. The condition
of reality for ξ(t, x, y) leads to the equations32

(10b)

Inserting the ansatz into the governing equations (7),
we obtain a set of algebraic equations for the amplitudes
of all perturbed quantities. The solvability condition for
this set gives us four values of the modiﬁed wave vector
q. Hence, the general solution of the set of governing
equations in the ferroﬂuid contains eight arbitrary con-
stants. Two more arbitrary constants are the amplitudes
of the perturbations of the ﬁeld in the air above and be-
low the ﬂuid after applying the boundary conditions at
z → ±∞. Ten of the boundary conditions [Eqs. (8) and
(3.2a)-(3.2f) in Ref. 37] allow one to express all the per-
turbed quantities in terms of the coeﬃcients ξn which
satisfy the equation

where Wn are rather complicated functions of the applied
ﬁeld, the frequency of vibrations, the depth of the ﬂuid
layer, and of the parameters of the ferroﬂuid. Here the
functions Wn depend additionally on the coupling con-
stant ε in contrast to the corresponding functions in the
previous paper37.

Equation (11) has to be satisﬁed for all times which
implies that each term of the sum equals to zero. Us-
ing the relations between ξn with positive and negative

where F is a complex function expressed in terms of con-
tinued fractions. Equation (13) can be solved numerically
and gives the dependence of a on k at ﬁxed parameters.
The critical values of the acceleration amplitude ac and
the wave number kc correspond to the absolute minimum

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 2 presents marginal stability curves for a viscous
ferroﬂuid at high frequency for two cases. The dashed
lines are calculated with neglect of the magnetization re-
↔
laxation time, a = 0 and b
= 0, i.e. the average orienta-
tion of chains immediately follows the ﬁeld perturbations.
The solid lines depict the neutral stability curves for the
system out of equilibrium. The dependence of the accel-
eration amplitude on the wave number for s = 0 divides
the phase space into regions, where the surface of the
ferroﬂuid is stable or unstable with respect to paramet-
rically driven standing waves. The principal data, which
can be extracted, are the critical acceleration amplitude
(scaled with g0), the critical wave number (scaled with
the capillary wave number kσ =
ρg/σ), and the num-
ber of the tongue to which they belong. The number of
a tongue l (from left to right) is the order of response:
the basic wave frequency related to the l-th tongue is
ωl = lω/2. The odd and even tongues are the regions,
where either a subharmonic or a harmonic instability de-
velops. That relation for the diﬀerent instability types
holds for Newtonian ferroﬂuids37 but experiences signif-
icant changes if the ferroﬂuid contains chains.

p

Due to the ﬁnite relaxation time the tongues are de-
formed. All tongues but one are now shaped by a lower
boundary, a pronounced tip, and a upper boundary. For
the chosen set of parameters in Fig. 2 the fourth tongue
becomes exceptionally deformed, since it has no tip and
no upper boundary in the way all other tongues have.
It is caused by the fact that the self-consistent equation
for the acceleration amplitude (13) has always a solu-
tion as k goes to inﬁnity. To note the diﬀerence to all

other deformed tongues, we call it a abnormal tongue
because this tongue lacks two essential features in com-
parison with all other tongues47. The typical arrange-
ment of tongues in Fig. 2 can be generalized as follows:
it is always an even tongue, labno = 2N , N = 1, 2, · · · ,
which becomes abnormal (here labno = 4). All tongues
with l > labno form separated pairs of two overlapping
tongues (here l = 5, 6 and l = 7, 8) inside the abnormal
tongue. All tongues corresponding to a higher order har-
monic response, l = labno+2L, L = 1, 2, · · · , are ”islands”
of stability with respect to a response of the system with
the frequency ωabno. In the domains, where the subhar-
monic tongues overlap with the regions of the harmonic
type of instability (gray regions in Fig. 2), both types of
instability can occur.

Figure 3 illustrates the scenario of the transition be-
tween the neutral stability curves with labno = 4 and
labno = 2 with an increase of the viscosity of the car-
rier liquid. At the point, where two tongues touch each
other, the amplitudes for the corresponding terms in the
Floquet ansatz (9) become equal. The number of the
abnormal tongue labno depends on the mean relaxation
time of a chain τ0 = 1/hh2Dii. The latter can be varied
by changing the viscosity of the carrier liquid η. In the

nm and ϕ = 0.082.

ﬁgure 4, the product ωabnoτ0 is presented as a function of
η. As the relaxation time increases with the viscosity, the
corresponding number labno decreases: from labno = 60
for η = 0.001 kg/(ms) to labno = 4 for η = 0.1 kg/(ms).
Therefore sequential changes of the number of the abnor-
mal tongue occur. The corresponding value of ωabnoτ0
shows a jump-like decrease at those points, where labno
drops to labno − 2.

Both the overlapping of tongues and the appearance
of an abnormal one were also observed for the Maxwell
viscoelastic liquid39,40, and it seems that these features
are signs of a viscoelastic behaviour. One has to note
that if the angular distribution of chains is assumed to
be in equilibrium (dashed lines in Fig. 2), i.e. τ0 = 0,
the neutral stability curves are standard tongues without
any qualitative changes in comparison with the case of
a Newtonian ferroﬂuid (studied in Ref. 37).
It shows
that it is the combination of chains and their nonzero
mean relaxation time which causes the new features in
the neutral stability curve.

The dependencies of the critical wave number and
the critical acceleration amplitude on the excitation fre-
quency f = ω/2π are presented in Fig. 5. The curves
denoted by A are calculated for a nonequilibrium mag-
netization and the curves B present the case, where the
chains follow the ﬁeld perturbations immediately. The

crease of the frequency the deviations of the magnetiza-
tion from an equilibrium and their importance become
smaller. Therefore, one can expect that curves A and B

Fig. 6 presents the relative diﬀerences between the
critical parameters k(free)
for a chain-free fer-
roﬂuid and those for a ferroﬂuid with chains as functions
of the Langevin parameter, i. e., of the dimensionless
magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetization, chord χc = M/H,
and diﬀerential susceptibility χd = ∂M/∂H of the chain-
free ferroﬂuid are chosen the same as in the ferroﬂuid
with chains at each point. The magnetization is out of
equilibrium in the ferroﬂuid with chains and is in equi-
librium in the chain-free one. It is seen, that at f = 20
Hz the formation of the chains decrease the critical wave
number [curve A in Fig. 6(a)]. Since the stresses at the
bottom layer are essential at this frequency and d = 2
mm, this leads to the increase of the critical acceleration
amplitude [curve A in Fig. 6(b)]. At the higher frequency,
f = 100 Hz, the changes of kc are non-monotonic. There
is a range of the parameters, where the critical wave num-
ber on the ferroﬂuid with chains is larger than that on
the chain-free ferroﬂuid. The critical acceleration ampli-
tude is decreased by the formation of chains [curve B in

numbers (a) and the critical acceleration amplitudes (b) as
functions of the Langevin parameter. The quantities with the

Fig. 6(b)]. Note, that the susceptibility of the ferroﬂuid
changes strongly with the increase of the ﬁeld, therefore
the relative importance of the inﬂuences of the magnetic
ﬁeld, the ﬂuid microstructure, and the viscous stresses
depends on the ﬁeld.

The above results were obtained for the particular case
k||H0. The typical size and orientation of chains depend
on the applied ﬁeld. Therefore, the threshold of the in-
stability depends on the strength of the ﬁeld and the
angle θ between k and H0 separately. It is not possible
to introduce a single parameter like the eﬀective ﬁeld37,
which would incorporate those two dependencies. This
fact is illustrated in Fig. 7. The product H0 cos θ was
varied in two ways. For the curves indicated by A, the
ﬁeld strength was changed from zero to H0max = 1.46
kA/m with θ = 0. In the second case (curves B), θ was
changed from zero to π/2 at the constant ﬁeld H0max.
In contrast to the chain-free ferroﬂuid studied in Ref.
37, where both curves would be identical, there are now
two diﬀerent graphs. Whereas the critical wave num-
bers have similar values for the two ways of variation,
the critical acceleration shows greater diﬀerences: for in-
stance for H0 cos θ/H0max = 0.5 the diﬀerence in kc is
0.4 % against 2.5 % for ac. Thus it makes a notable
diﬀerence for the stability of the free surface whether
the system is subjected to (θ = 0, H0 = H0max/2) or
to (θ = 60◦, H0 = H0max). This fact suggests a simple

method to test the presence of chains in a sample.
If
the ferroﬂuid is chain-free both ways of excitation lead
to the same value of ac, if it contains chains one gets two
diﬀerent values.

The dependencies are less pronounced than in the pre-
vious case, where H0max = 26.6 kA/m37, due to the fact
that the range of rather weak ﬁelds is studied here. Such
a choice of ﬁelds ensures that hni ≤ ε and that the head-
to-tail orientation of the moments in a chain is still prefer-
able which is needed to apply the model.

The nonmonotonic dependence of ac(H0) for θ = 0
[curve A in Fig. 7(b)] caused by the joint action of the two
mechanisms of the viscous damping: i) the dissipation in
the bulk ﬂuid and ii) the viscous stresses in the bottom
ﬂuid layer. The ﬁrst mechanism is dominant for large
wave numbers and causes a decrease of ac. The second
becomes important with the decrease of the wave num-
ber and results in an increase of ac with ﬁeld strength.
A detailed discussion of this nonmonotonic behaviour of
ac(H) is given in Ref. 37.

There are three eﬀects caused by the formation of
chains. Since a chain has a magnetic moment larger than
that of a single particle, the formation of chains leads to
the increase of the magnetization of the system at the
given ﬁeld in comparison with a homogeneous ferroﬂuid.
This strengthens the ﬁeld inﬂuence on the ﬂuid motion.
The eﬀect can be formally taken into account by adjust-

8

ing the magnetization and susceptibility of the chain-free
ferroﬂuid in such a way as it is done in Fig. 6. The two
other eﬀects are more interesting. The chains increase
the magnetization relaxation time and change the eﬀec-
tive viscosity of the suspension both in a steady and in a
periodical ﬂow19,20,24.

In order to investigate the role of these two eﬀects,
a number of model ferroﬂuids are considered. The ﬁrst
sample is a ferroﬂuid with chains. It is characterized by
the mean relaxation time of a chain τ0 and unperturbed
values of the magnetization M0 as well as the chord χc
and the diﬀerential susceptibility χd. The second model
ferroﬂuid contains as well chains, but in this case the re-
laxation time is neglected [ψn(e) = ψ0
n(e)]. The third
and the fourth ferroﬂuid is chain-free (gn = δn,1ϕ/v)
with the same unperturbed values of M0, χc, and χd.
The magnetization relaxation time for the third ferroﬂuid
is equal to τ0, and for the forth sample the relaxation
time is neglected, i.e. the last sample is the ferroﬂuid,
which was studied in Ref. 37. The predictions of the
Zubarev model for the case of a chain-free ferroﬂuid with
a ﬁnite relaxation time were compared with the results
of a model using the eﬀective ﬁeld theory developed by
Martsenyuk, Raikher, and Shliomis in 197448.
In the
both cases, the Langevin parameter κadj involved in the
model was adjusted to obey mϕ/vL(κadj) = M0,where
L(κ) = coth(κ) − 1/κ denotes the Langevin function.
A fairly good agreement between the threshold param-

eters predicted by both models is observed.
ure 8 the coupling constant ε is varied by changing the
temperature. The intensity of the applied magnetic ﬁeld
H0 is changed in such a way that the Langevin parameter
is equal to κ = 0.5.

The comparison of the presented dependencies reveals
that the ﬁniteness of the magnetization relaxation time
leads to an increase of the critical wave number [compare
the pairs of the curves A – C and B – D in Fig. 8(a)].
At the same time, the changes in the slow-ﬂow rheologi-
cal properties of the suspension caused by the formation
of the chains decrease strongly the critical wave number
(compare curves C – D and A – B). The net eﬀect of
those two inﬂuences gives the behaviour that is presented
by the curves B in Fig. 8.

The critical acceleration amplitude for a ferroﬂuid
with nonequilibrium chains [curve B in Fig. 8(b)] has
the lowest value among all the tested model ferroﬂu-
ids. This can be interpreted as a sign of an elastic be-
haviour, which is typical for viscoelastic liquids at high
frequencies. This fact is conﬁrmed in Fig. 9, where the
real and the imaginary parts of the eﬀective viscosity
ηeﬀ = [σik/(2γikη) − 1]/ϕ of a ferroﬂuid are presented as
functions of the frequency of surface waves fl = ωl/(2π)
with l = 1. The case H0 = 0 is considered, where the
system is isotropic and the inﬂuence of the chains on the
rheological properties of the suspension can be character-
24. The real part
ized by the single complex parameter ηeﬀ
of the eﬀective viscosity determines the dissipation of the
energy in the system, and a nonzero imaginary part leads

to a phase shift between the tensor of velocity gradients
and the stress tensor, i.e. to a viscoelastic behaviour. It
is seen that the imaginary part of the eﬀective viscosity
is nonzero and has a maximum at a frequency of fl ≃ 5
Hz [solid line in Fig. 9(b)], where therefore a maximal
phase shift (viscoelastic behaviour) can be expected. At
the same time, the real part of the eﬀective viscosity de-
creases [solid line in Fig. 9(a)]. The eﬀective viscosity for
a stationary ﬂow (with neglect of the relaxation time) is
plotted as dashed line. It is seen that the deviations of
the orientational distribution from equilibrium result in
a decrease of the real part of the eﬀective viscosity. This
implies that the energy is dissipated weaker, and that
consequently ac is lower than in the case of zero relax-
ation time. The comparison of the solid curve with the
dotted ones in Fig. 9(b) shows that the maximum of the
imaginary part of the eﬀective viscosity is caused by the
long chains.

A comparison of the contributions of chains of diﬀerent
size is done in Fig. 10 for three values of the wave fre-
quency. The size distribution of chains (1) is presented
with ﬁlled circles in part (a) of that ﬁgure.
It is seen
that at low frequencies (f = 1 Hz) the viscoelastic eﬀect
is mainly caused by very long chains with small values of
gn [see maximum of −Im(ηeﬀ n) at n = 16 in Fig. 10(b)].
For f = 5 Hz the maximum of −Im(ηeﬀ n) is shifted to
long chains (n = 11) and the value of the maximum in-

creases. Together with the larger values of gn for those
long chains, the total viscoelastic eﬀect is larger than for
f = 1 Hz [compare the area under the ◦- and (cid:3)-curve in
Fig. 10(b)]. For high frequencies as f = 100 Hz the max-
imum of −Im(ηeﬀ n) is at short chains (n = 5) and the
value of the maximum decreases. This decrease cannot
be compensated by the even larger values of gn for those
short chains. Thus the total viscoelastic eﬀect decreases
again: the area under the ♦-curve is smaller than the
area under the (cid:3)-curve.

In summary, by increasing the frequency from 1 to 100
Hz the viscoelastic eﬀect passes at maximum at f = 5
Hz [solid curve in Fig. 9(b)]. The maximal contribution
to −Im(ηeﬀ n) comes for f . 100 Hz from chains oﬀ the
maximum of gn. Comparing the area under the ◦-, (cid:3)-,
and ♦-curve in Fig. 10(a), one can see that the area is
continuously shrinking with f . It results in the solid line
in Fig. 9(a) describing the weaker dissipation of energy
in the system.

The origin of the viscoelasticity (i. e., the dependence
of the relation between the tensors of velocity gradients
and the stress tensor on the history) in a ferroﬂuid with
chains can be explain in the following way. When the
orientation of a chain is changed from the equilibrium
by the velocity gradients, a restraining moment is gener-
ated by the applied ﬁeld. Thus the network of chains is
an ”elastic” element of the system, which interacts with
the viscous carrier liquid.
If the relaxation time of a
chain is much shorter than the period of the vibrations,
the orientation of chains and consequently the rheologi-
cal properties of the suspension do not depend on history,
and there is no viscoelastic properties. This fact becomes
more obvious, if one notes that the relaxation time of a
chain is proportional to the carrier liquid viscosity. Thus
the negligible relaxation time of a chain implies a weak
coupling between the chain and the carrier.

To estimate the importance of the relaxation processes
in a ferroﬂuid with chains, the Deborah number De is
calculated for the subharmonic response. The Deborah
number is the product of the angular wave frequency
with the mean relaxation time of a chain, De = ωlτ0.
In the case of polymer solutions, the most pronounced
viscoelastic behaviour should be expected in the range of
De ≈ 1, whereas at De ≫ 1 a recovery of the Newtonian
behaviour was observed41. In the case of ferroﬂuids with
chains, the viscoelastic behaviour is present over a much
wider De range. The frequency range of Fig. 9 gives
0.033 ≤ De ≤ 3.3 for which a viscoelastic behaviour
is present since −Im(ηeﬀ ) 6= 0. That fact is supported
by the range of appearance for the abnormal tongues
considered to be a characteristic feature of viscoelastic
behaviour. From Fig. 4 one can read that viscoelastic
properties can be expected even for De beyond 10.

Obviously the viscoelasticity of a ferroﬂuid with chains
diﬀers from that of a polymer solution. The reason for
this diﬀerence is the following. The relaxation time of
a long polymer chain involved in the polymer dynam-
ics is the conformational relaxation time. As soon as

10

the period of excitation becomes much shorter than the
conformational relaxation time, the polymer chain does
not participate in the movement of the solution. There-
fore a motion of the Newtonian solvent through the rigid
obstacles of polymer chains is observed. In the case of
the rather short chains formed by magnetic particles, the
relaxation time is the orientational relaxation time of a
chain49 in the viscous carrier liquid. Since it is propor-
tional to the viscosity of the carrier liquid, the high val-
ues of τ0 and De, respectively, mean a strong coupling
between the motion of a chain and the carrier liquid,
which ensures the viscoelastic behaviour. Thus ferroﬂu-
ids widen signiﬁcantly the range in which viscoelastic fea-
tures can be observed in contrast to polymer solutions.

In a real ferroﬂuid, any variation of the system param-
eters not only varies the Deborah number but also af-
fects the critical parameters either directly or indirectly
by changing other properties as permeability or viscosity.
In order to investigate the role of the deviations of the
chains from equilibrium in greater detail, a model fer-
roﬂuid with a tunable coeﬃcient of rotational diﬀusion
for all chains Dtune,n = DnDscale is studied. Via that
coeﬃcient the mean relaxation time τ0, i.e. the Deborah
number, can be varied.

Dscale is a phenomenological parameter, which is re-
lated neither to the chain size nor to the ﬂuid properties.
Using this phenomenological parameter, a smooth tran-
sition can be realized from a model ferroﬂuid with chains

almost in equilibrium (Dscale ≫ 1 gives De ≪ 1) to the
real ferroﬂuid (Dscale = 1), and further to a model fer-
roﬂuid with chains far from the equilibrium (Dscale ≪ 1
gives De ≫ 1).

It is seen in Fig. 11 that even small deviations from
equilibrium are signiﬁcant as the variation of kc and ac
in the range from De ∼ 0.001 to De ∼ 0.01 show. In the
case of a system with long chains (ε = 5.5), a pronounced
minimum in the dependence of ac(De) and a maximum
in that of kc(De) are observed. As ε and the mean chain
length decrease, these extrema are shifted towards higher
values of De and become less pronounced and disappear
for ε = 4.5. Beyond De ∼ O(1) one observes a saturation
of kc and ac close to the corresponding extremal values.
That means that beyond a certain deviation from equi-
librium, viscoelastic eﬀects can neither be enhanced nor
diminished. The latter conﬁrms that there is no recovery
to a Newtonian behaviour at high De numbers.

V. CONCLUSION

The rheological properties of a ferroﬂuid caused by the
formation of chains is investigated by the linear analy-
sis of the Faraday instability in a horizontal magnetic
ﬁeld. A horizontally unbounded ferroﬂuid layer of a ﬁ-
nite depth has been considered. The dependencies of the
critical acceleration amplitude ac and the critical wave
vector on the excitation frequency f , the magnetic ﬁeld
H0, and the dipolar coupling constant ε have been ob-
tained for diﬀerent depths of the layer in a wide range
of ﬂuid viscosities. A viscoelastic behaviour is predicted,
which is indicated by the qualitative changes in the neu-
tral stability curve: an abnormal tongue appears which
has no tip and upper boundary in contrast to all other
tongues (Fig. 2). Beside its existence it is revealed how
this abnormal tongues is formed by the merging of other
tongues as the viscosity of the carrier liquid is changed

11

(Fig. 3).

The threshold of the instability depends on the applied
ﬁeld and on the angle θ between the wave vector and
the applied ﬁeld separately (Fig. 7). Therefore one can
easily test a ferroﬂuid whether it contains chains or not by
choosing diﬀerent combinations of θ and H0 but the same
value for H0 cos θ. If the ferroﬂuid contains chains one
get diﬀerent thresholds whereas the surface of a chain-
free ferroﬂuid is destabilized at a unique value of ac.

A ferroﬂuid with chains whose orientation is out of
equilibrium compared with other model ferroﬂuids (Figs.
6, 8) has the lowest threshold of all. This is caused by
a decrease of the real part of the eﬀective viscosity [Fig.
9(a)] which corresponds to a weaker dissipation of energy
and thus to a lower value of ac. The nonzero imaginary
part of the eﬀective viscosity [Fig. 9(b)] indicates also the
viscoelastic behaviour of the studied ferroﬂuid. By ana-
lyzing the dependence of the critical parameters on the
Deborah number, it is found that a viscoelastic behaviour
occurs over a much wider range than in viscoelastic poly-
mer solutions. Particularly no recovery to a Newtonian
behaviour at high Deborah numbers is found.

The present model

is restricted to the case of a
monodisperse ferroﬂuid. An account of the polydisper-
sity will be necessary to compare the predictions with
future experiments using real ferroﬂuids. The dipolar
interactions between chains and their ﬂexibility will in-
ﬂuence the properties of a real ferroﬂuid. Nevertheless,
the above-discussed eﬀects should be detectable, at least
qualitatively, in a real experiment.

49 The estimation for the ratio of the kinematic energy of
the chain rotation and the thermal energy gives 10−8 for
a chain containing 5 particles and f = 100 Hz, therefore,
inertia of a chain is neglected.

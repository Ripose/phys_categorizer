We investigate the self-locomotion of an elongated microswim-
mer by virtue of the unidirectional tangential surface treadmilling.
We show that the propulsion could be almost frictionless, as the
microswimmer is propelled forward with the speed of the back-
ward surface motion, i.e.
it moves throughout an almost quies-
cent ﬂuid. We investigate this swimming technique using the spe-
cial spheroidal coordinates and also ﬁnd an explicit closed-form
optimal solution for a two-dimensional treadmiler via complex-
variable techniques.

self-locomotion | creeping ﬂow | motility | propulsion efﬁciency

T iny swimmers, be they micro-organisms or microbots, live in a

world dominated by friction [1]. In this world, technically, the
world of low Reynolds numbers, motion is associated with energy
dissipation. In the absence of external energy supply objects rapidly
come to rest [2]. It is both conceptually interesting, and technologi-
cally important, to try and understand what classes of strategies lead
to effective swimming in a setting dominated by dissipation. A par-
ticularly promising class of strategies is where the motion is, in a
sense, only apparent; where a shape moves with little or no motion of
material particles.

The wheel is the mechanical application of this strategy and it is
instructive to examine it from this point of view. The (unholonomic)
constraint of rolling without slipping comes about because of the large
friction between the wheel and the surface supporting it. Neverthe-
less, a wheel can roll with little or no dissipation of energy. One way
to view this is to note that the motion of the point of contact is only
apparent. The point of contact moves, even though the part of the
wheel in contact with the surface, is momentarily at rest.

An example closer to the world of low Reynolds numbers, is the
actin-based propulsion of the leading edge of motile cells [3], intra-
cellular bacterial pathogens [4] and biomimetic cargoes [5, 6, 7]. The
actin ﬁlaments assemble themselves from the ambient solution at the
front end and disassemble themselves at the rear end. Here again, it
is only shape that is moving and in principle at least the energy in-
vested at the front end can be recovered at the rear end. (There are
thermodynamics and entropic issues that we shall not consider here.)
Apparent motions seem to be good at ﬁghting dissipation [8].

Here we shall focus on a closely related mode of locomotion: sur-
face treadmilling. In surface treadmilling the swimmer moves without
a change of shape, by a tangential surface motion. Surface is gener-
ated at the front end and is consumed at the rear end1. In contrast to
actin and microtubules, the surface treadmilling does not rely on the
exchange of material with the ambient ﬂuid. (The swimmer needs,
of course, an inner mechanism to transfer material from its rear to its
front). It is intuitively clear that a needle shaped swimmer undergoing
treadmilling can move with very little dissipation because the ambi-
ent ﬂuid is almost quiescent and there is almost no relative motion
between the surface of the swimmer and the ﬂuid. One can not make
treadmilling completely non-dissipative because there is always some
remanent dissipation associated with the motion of the front and rear
ends. The main question that we shall address here is how can one
quantitatively estimate this remanent dissipation.

Let us ﬁrst consider simple qualitative estimates of the power
dissipated by viscosity in treadmilling. Consider, a rod-like slender

swimmer of length ℓ, thickness d with rounded caps undergoing tread-
milling at velocity U . It is reasonable to assume (and the analysis in
the following section can be used to justify) that all the dissipation is
associated with the rounded ends. Hence, by dimensional analysis,
the power dissipated in treadmilling is of the order of µdU 2 where µ
is the viscosity coefﬁcient. Let us compare this with the power needed
to drag the “frozen" treadmiler. By Cox slender body theory [12] the
µℓU 2/ log (2ℓ/d).
power needed to drag the tube with velocity U is
Hence the ratio of power invested in dragging and swimming scales
like (ε log 1/ε)−1 and can be made arbitrarily large. Here ε = d/ℓ
is the aspect ratio of the swimmer.

∼

One can now ask if there are slender treadmilers that are arbi-
trarily better than the slender rod-like treadmiler above? Consider
now an elongated ellipsoidal microswimmer whose surface is given
by z2/b2 +r2/a2 = 1 where r2

≡
the viscous dissipation is a result of a tip propulsion, and estimate the
position of the tip from the condition

We shall see, by a more accurate analysis, that for prolate spheroid
the ratio of power in treadmilling to dragging is of the order of
(ε log ε)−2. In the following sections we shall analyze two models of
treadmillers in 3 and 2 dimensions, respectively.

expected, the micro-swimmer is self-propelled forward with the ve-

laboratory frame is (almost) zero.
Swimming efﬁciency. Since the ﬂuid around the elongated mi-
croswimmer propelled by continuous surface treadmilling is almost
quiescent, except for the near vicinity of the poles, it is natural to
expect low viscous dissipation and high hydrodynamic swimming ef-
ﬁciency. Several deﬁnitions of hydrodynamic efﬁciency have been
proposed [13, 14, 19] here we follow the deﬁnition δ = F · U /
,
P
is the energy dissipated in swimming with velocity U , and
where
the expression in the numerator is the work expanded by dragging the
“frozen" swimmer at velocity U upon action of an external force F
[13]. δ is dimensionless and compares the self-propulsion with drag-
ging (some authors use the reciprocal efﬁciency 1/δ). The higher δ
the more efﬁcient the swimmer is. For an axisymmetric swimmer
propelled along the symmetry axis, F · U =
U 2, where the scalar
is the appropriate hydrodynamic resistance. The work done by an

This result is shown in Figure 2 as a dashed line. For comparison, the
efﬁciency of spherical squirmers self-propelled by propagating sur-
face waves along their surface (the mathematical model of cianobac-
3
4 , while numerically calcu-
teria [15]) has the upper bound δ
lated values of δ do much worse than dragging and the corresponding
swimming efﬁciency is usually less than 2% [13]. Swimming by sur-
face treadmilling is remarkably more efﬁcient than the rotating helical
ﬂagellum [16], beating ﬂexible ﬁlament [17], the Percell’s “three-link
swimmer" [18] or locomotion by virtue of shape strokes [14, 19]. The
surface treadmilling is probably superior to any inertialess swimming
techniques proposed so far.

≤

Also, the swimming efﬁciency of the ellipsoidal treadmiler is
superior by a factor of (ε log 1/ε)−1 over the estimate of δ corre-
sponding to the rod-like treadmiler with rounded ends derived from
purely scaling arguments in the introduction. Therefore, the geome-
try (via κs) plays an important role in minimizing the dissipation in
surface treadmilling, which is rather surprising since the drag force
on slender nonmotile object does not depend on its shape to the ﬁrst
approximation.
Optimal swimming.We can set an upper bound on δ for a
spheroidal microswimmer in terms of surface integrals of an arbi-
trary velocity u(ζ) analogously to [13]. The power dissipated in
self-propulsion is bounded from below according to [ 14 ] by

the two-term boundary velocity [ 19 ], while for L > 4 closed form
expressions are cumbersome, and numerical solutions were derived
instead. Analogously to the theory for a 2-D swimmer (see the next
section), where the explicit optimal solution was shown to acquire an
inﬁnite number of harmonics in the expansion for the boundary veloc-
ity, increasing the truncation level L in [ 19 ] will further improve the
efﬁciency of swimming, though the enhancement appears to be minor.
To illustrate this, we calculate the optimal solution upon varying L.

singularity at x = α must be avoided. This determines the integration

Concluding remarks. In this paper we examined the propulsion of
elongated microswimmer by virtue of the continuous surface tread-
milling. As the slenderness increases, the hydrodynamic disturbance
the microbot is pro-
created by the surface motion diminishes, i.e.
pelled forward with the velocity of the surface treadmilling, while
surface, except the near vicinity of the poles, remains stationary in the
laboratory frame. As a result of that, the ‘cigar-shaped’ treadmiler
is self-propelled throughout almost quiescent ﬂuid yielding very low
viscous dissipation. The calculation of optimal hydrodynamic efﬁ-
ciency of the 3-D and the 2-D microswimmers reveals that the pro-
posed swimming technique is not only superior to various motility
mechanisms considered in the past, but also perform much better than
dragging under the action of an external force.

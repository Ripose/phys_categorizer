Abstract

The eﬀect of an externally applied ﬂow on symmetry degenerated waves propagating into opposite

directions and standing waves that exchange stability with the traveling waves via mixed states is

analyzed. Wave structures that consist of spiral vortices in the counter rotating Taylor-Couette

system are investigated by full numerical simulations and explained quantitatively by amplitude

equations containing quintic coupling terms.

Many nonlinear structure forming systems that are driven out of equilibrium show a

transition to traveling waves (TWs) as a result of an oscillatory instability [1].

In the

presence of inversion symmetry in one or two spatial directions also a standing wave (SW)

solution bifurcates in addition to the symmetry degenerate, oppositely propagating TWs

at the same threshold. Moreover, depending on the parameters one can have a stability

exchange between TWs and SWs as the driving rate varies. The stability transfer is mediated

by mixed patterns that establish in the solution space a connection between a pure TW and

a pure SW.

Here we investigate how externally tunable symmetry breaking perturbations change

stability, bifurcation properties, and the spatiotemporal behavior of the afore mentioned

structures. To be concrete we investigate vortex waves in the annular gap between counter

rotating concentric cylinders of the Taylor-Couette system [2, 3]. To that end we performed

full numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations with methods described in [4]. We

elucidate that and how these results can be explained quantitatively by amplitude equations

which contain quintic order coupling terms. The perturbation is realized in our system

by an externally enforced axial through-ﬂow that can easily be controlled experimentally.

However, our results concerning the inﬂuence of inversion symmetry breaking perturbations

on TWs, SWs, and on the mixed states are more general.

Structures – Without through-ﬂow the following oscillatory vortex structures occur at

small driving [5, 6]: (i) Forward bifurcating TWs consisting of left handed spiral vortices

(L-SPI) or of right handed spiral vortices (R-SPI) that are mirror images of each other. L-

SPI (R-SPI) travel in the annulus between the two cylinders into (opposite to) the direction

of the rotation frequency vector of the inner one, i.e., in our notation upwards (downwards)

[4]. (ii) Forward bifurcating SWs that consist of an equal-amplitude nonlinear combination

of L-SPI and R-SPI that are called ribbons (RIBs) in the Taylor-Couette literature [7, 8].

(iii) So-called cross-spirals (CR-SPI), i.e., combinations of L-SPI and R-SPI with diﬀerent

amplitudes. They provide a stability transferring connection between TW and SW solution

branches [3, 6]. The vortex structures (i)-(iii) are axially and azimuthally periodic with

wave numbers k = 2π/λ and M, respectively, with λ = 1.3 and M = 2 throughout this

paper. They rotate with characteristic constant angular velocities as a whole into the same

direction as the inner cylinder [4]. Thereby they are forced to propagate axially with the

exception of RIB vortices which rotate only but do not propagate.

Order parameters – Figures 1-2 show bifurcation diagrams of SPI, CR-SPI, and RIB

solutions in a system of radius ratio η = 1/2 for ﬁxed R1 = 240 versus the reduced distance

R1 and R2 are the Reynolds numbers deﬁned by the rotational velocities of the inner and

outer cylinder, respectively, and Re is the Reynolds number of the imposed axial through-

ﬂow. In Figs. 1 and 2, the inﬂuence of a small through-ﬂow (Re = 0.02) is compared with

the situation without through-ﬂow. Order parameters in Fig. 1 are the squared amplitudes

|A|2, |B|2 of the dominant critical modes

u2,1(t) = |A|e−iωAt,

u2,−1(t) = |B|e−iωBt

(1)

in the double Fourier decomposition of the radial velocity u at mid-gap in azimuthal and

axial direction. The indices 2 and ±1 identify azimuthal and axial modes, respectively. The

linear stability analysis of the basic state consisting of a superposition of circular Couette

ﬂow and of annular Poiseuille ﬂow in axial direction shows that the growth rates of these

modes become positive at the respective bifurcation thresholds µA and µB of M = 2 L-SPI

and R-SPI, respectively. Note also that for all relaxed vortex structures investigated here

the moduli and frequencies of u2,±1 in Eq. (1) are constant.

In Fig. 2 we show in addition the bifurcation diagrams of the combinations

since they are convenient to describe in particular CR-SPI.

Bifurcation scenario for zero through-ﬂow – In the symmetry degenerate case without

through-ﬂow L-SPI (A 6= 0 = B, D > 0) and R-SPI (A = 0 6= B, D < 0) have identical

bifurcation properties. They are stable close to onset whereas RIB (A = B, D = 0) are

initially unstable. In the driving range shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2 the squared amplitudes of

these two states grow practically linearly with the reduced distance µ from the common onset

at µ = 0, albeit with diﬀerent slopes. Then, there appear in a ﬁnite supercritical driving

interval stable CR-SPI solutions which transfer stability from SPI to RIB. The solution

which bifurcates with B = 0 out of the L-SPI is identiﬁed as a L-CR-SPI with |A| > |B|,

i.e., D > 0. The symmetry degenerate R-CR-SPI (|B| > |A|, D < 0) bifurcates with A = 0

out of the R-SPI. In the former |B| grows and |A| decreases – and vice versa in the latter

– until the CR-SPI branches end with A = B, D = 0 in the RIB solution. The amplitude

February 21, 2014

4

variations of the CR-SPI solutions, however, are such that the sum S remains practically

constant, cf. Fig. 2(a). The RIB state loses stability outside the plot range of ﬁgures 1 and

2 to another type of amplitude-modulated CR-SPI that are not discussed here.

Through-ﬂow induced changes – The axial through-ﬂow signiﬁcantly perturbs and changes

structure, dynamics, and bifurcation behavior of the SPI vortex solutions discussed so far

[4, 9, 10, 11]: RIBs cease to exist in the strict sense, L- and R-SPI are no longer mirror

images of each other, and also L-CR-SPI are no longer related to R-CR-SPI by this symmetry

operation. However, spirals retain their spatiotemporal structure in the through-ﬂow, i.e.,

they still do not depend on ϕ, z, t separately but only on the phase combination φA =

Mϕ + kz − ωAt or φB = Mϕ − kz − ωBt, respectively. L-SPI (red color in Figs. 1-2)

bifurcate for small Re > 0 at a threshold value µA < 0 prior to R-SPI (orange color) which

bifurcate at 0 < µB ≈ −µA out of the basic state.

L-SPI are again stable at onset, but then lose stability to L-CR-SPI (violet color) which

remain stable in the plotted parameter regime. The L-CR-SPI solution approaches the

(Re = 0) RIB state with increasing µ, but retains with A 6= B a ﬁnite distance D > 0.

On the other hand, R-SPI are unstable for small and large µ, but stable for intermediate µ.

Stability is exchanged with a R-CR-SPI (magenta color ) which has a stable as well as an

unstable branch resulting from a saddle-node bifurcation at µS in Figs. 1, 2. For small µ the

unstable R-CR-SPI lies close to the (Re = 0) RIB solution and bifurcates with ﬁnite D < 0

out of the R-SPI slightly above µB. Note also that the sum of the squared amplitudes S of

CR-SPI is no longer constant as for the case of Re = 0.

Amplitude equations – The changes in spatiotemporal, bifurcation, and stability behavior

of SPI, CR-SPI, and RIB states by a small through-ﬂow can be explained and described

close to onset quantitatively within an amplitude-equation approach. To demonstrate that

we focus here on the bifurcation properties of the moduli |A|, |B| of the critical modes.

In order to reproduce the bifurcation and stability behavior of the aforementioned vortex

states including the CR-SPI one needs coupled equations for A and B of at least quintic

order. Higher-order terms that are suggested in [3] are not necessary to ensure the existence

of CR-SPI solutions. Symmetry arguments [3, 6] restrict the form of the equations for the

with real coeﬃcients that depend in general on Re. Here we have discarded the quintic

terms |A|5 and |B|5 in view of the linear variation of the squared SPI moduli with µ, cf.

Fig. 1. Furthermore, we made a special choice for the coeﬃcients of the last terms |A||B|4

and |B||A|4 in Eq. (3) that is motivated by the linear variation of the squared RIB moduli

with µ for Re = 0 and that suﬃces to describe the behavior for small Re as well.

Coeﬃcients – As a result of the inversion symmetry under z ↔ −z which includes revert-

ing the through-ﬂow the coupled equations are invariant under the operation (A, B, Re) ↔

(B, A, −Re) so that the coeﬃcients in Eq. (3) obey relations like, e.g., cA(Re) = cB(−Re).

To reproduce the bifurcation properties of the moduli for small Re as in Figs. 1, 2 it suﬃces

to incorporate the Re dependence to linear order in the coeﬃcients

µA(Re) = −µ(1)Re,

µB(Re) = µ(1)Re

cA(Re) = c + c(1)Re,

cB(Re) = c − c(1)Re

only and to ignore any Re dependence of the others by setting

bA = bB = b,

eA = eB = e.

The choice bA = bB = b reﬂects the fact that the linear growth of the squared SPI moduli

with the distance from their respective thresholds at µA and µB is unchanged by the through-

ﬂow. On the other hand, the downwards shift of the L-SPI onset being for small through-

ﬂow of equal magnitude as the upwards shift of the R-SPI onset is reﬂected by µA(Re) =
−µB(Re) = −µ(1)Re with positive µ(1). The coupling constant eA = eB = e ensures the

existence of CR-SPI solutions [6]. The ﬂow induced changes of the coupling constants cA

and cB reﬂect the perturbation and destruction of the RIB states and ensures for positive

Re L-CR-SPI solutions with D > 0 when µ is large. The values of the coeﬃcients [12] were

obtained from linear stability analyses and by ﬁts to the full numerical nonlinear results.

Fixed points – With the coeﬃcients (4) it is straightforward to derive from (3) the following

February 21, 2014

relations for the ﬁxed points of S and D

µ + (b + c) S − c(1)ReD − 2eD2 = 0,

µ(1)Re + (b − c)D + c(1)ReS + 2eSD = 0.

(5a)

(5b)

From these equations we have obtained the lines in the bifurcation plots of |A|2 = S + D and

|B|2 = S − D in Fig. 1 and of S and D in Fig. 2. They compare very well with the symbols

from the full numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, say, up to Re ≃ 0.2 or so.

Beyond that higher order terms in the Re-expansion of the coeﬃcients should be included.

Perturbation of the RIB → CR-SPI bifurcation – The black lines and symbols in Figs. 1,

2 show that without through-ﬂow the RIB state which is stable at large µ transfers stability

to CR-SPI in a pitchfork bifurcation located at µ2 in Fig. 1, 2. The symmetry and topology

of this unperturbed bifurcation out of the D = 0 RIB solution at µ2 = −(b + c)S∗, S∗ =

(c−b)/(2e) is best seen in Fig. 2(b). This ﬁgure shows also most clearly how the through-ﬂow

with Re > 0 perturbs this bifurcation into a continuously varying stable solution branch

with D > 0 (violet) and a pair of stable and unstable solutions (magenta) that are connected

by a saddle-node bifurcation at µS.

The values of S and D at the unperturbed location µ = µ2 of the pitchfork bifurcation

Larger through-ﬂow – Here we investigate the transformation of the unperturbed RIB

state into a CR-SPI as a function of the through-ﬂow strength extending to larger Reynolds

numbers up to Re = 4 which are about 200 times larger than those studied so far in this

paper. For such large Re the amplitude equations with the simple Re dependence of the

February 21, 2014

7

coeﬃcients (4) are no longer adequate to describe the behavior of the order parameters S

and D. However, they continue to follow the same simple power laws with Re as the ones for

small through-ﬂow: When µ is well away from the location µ2 of the unperturbed pitchfork

bifurcation as in Fig. 4(a-c) one has S = S(0) + S(2)Re2 , D = D(1)Re + D(3)Re3. On the

other hand, at µ2, as in Fig. 4(d-f) one has S = S(0) + S(2/3)(Re1/3)2 + S(4/3)(Re1/3)4 , D =
D(1/3)Re1/3 + D(1)(Re1/3)3. The lines in Fig. 4 show ﬁts of the data from the full numerical

simulations (symbols) to these power law expansions for S and D. Fig. 4(c,f) shows plots

of the resulting squared moduli |A|2 = S + D and |B|2 = S − D.

Note that inversion symmetry z ↔ −z implies S(−Re) = S(Re) and D(−Re) = −D(Re).

For Re > 0 (Re < 0) the RIB state is transformed into a L-CR-SPI (R-CR-SPI) with A

(B) being the major mode and B (A) the minor one. With increasing through-ﬂow the

major (minor) mode of the CR-SPI increases (decreases) until the minor mode vanishes in

the transition to a pure SPI.

We study the breakup of a liquid jet a few nanometers in
diameter, based on a stochastic diﬀerential equation derived
recently by Moseler and Landman [Science 289, 1165 (2000)].
In agreement with their simulations, we conﬁrm that noise
qualitatively changes the characteristics of breakup, leading
to symmetric proﬁles. Using the path integral description,
we ﬁnd a self-similar proﬁle that describes the most probable
breakup mode. As illustrated by a simple physical argument,
noise is the driving force behind pinching, speeding up the
breakup to make surface tension irrelevant.

Given the current trend for miniaturization, it is nat-
ural to ask about the behavior of liquids on increasingly
small scales, where thermal ﬂuctuations eventually be-
come important. In the case of free surfaces, relevant for
all printing and microstructuring applications [1], ﬂuctu-
ations can expected to be even larger than in conﬁned
geometries. Their importance is estimated by comparing
the thermal energy kBT with the surface tension γ. Thus
for structures whose size is in the order of the thermal
length scale ℓT = (kBT /γ)1/2 [2], usually about a nm at
room temperature, ﬂuctuations should make a leading-
order contribution. Predicting the (typical) behavior of
ﬂuids on the nanoscale is therefore an extremely chal-
lenging statistical physics problem, since the noise can
no longer be treated in a standard perturbative fashion
[3]. Instead, non-perturbative methods are called for to
properly account for thermal ﬂuctuations.

In the absence of experiments that could directly mea-
sure ﬂuid ﬂow on the nanoscale, molecular dynamics
(MD) [4,5] computations are an ideal tool. Previous anal-
yses of drops and threads [6–8] convincingly showed hy-
drodynamic behavior on the nanometer scale, and agree-
ment with breakup times and growth rates as predicted
by linear theory [9]. Recently [10] a realistic molecu-
lar dynamics simulation of a jet of propane issuing from
a nozzle 6 nm in diameter was performed, which also
payed close attention to the nonlinear dynamics close
to breakup. Remarkably, a coherent jet develops, from
which drops separate at slightly irregular intervals to
form a quasi-stationary decaying state. If nozzles of this
size were to be built, this opens dazzling perspectives of
transporting current printing and structuring techniques
into the nanoworld.

However, a careful analysis of the breakup process re-
vealed [10] that the presence of noise qualitatively alters
the character of the breakup. While the deterministic

motion at a corresponding Reynolds number forms elon-
gated necks between successive drops [9], noise leads to
proﬁles symmetric around the pinch point. Thus satel-
lite drops rarely form and quite surprisingly the distribu-
tion of drop sizes becomes narrower. In addition, on the
nanoscale the motion of the minimum neck radius accel-
erates as breakup is approached, while the correspond-
ing time dependence hmin = 0.03(γρ/ν)(t0 − t) is linear
for deterministic pinching [11]. Here ν is the kinematic
viscosity and ρ the density of the ﬂuid. Thus the theo-
retical challenge is to understand this qualitative change
of behavior in a regime where noise makes the leading
contribution.

To deal with the above set of problems, we use the con-
tinuum description given by [10], which consists in adding
a stochastic term to the lubrication description of a de-
terministic jet [12]. The amplitude of the noise is ﬁxed
by the condition of detailed balance [13]. Detailed nu-
merical simulations of the stochastic equation gave very
convincing agreement with MD simulations. This means
that hydrodynamics, at least when suitably generalized
to include ﬂuctuations, is fully capable of describing free-
surface ﬂows down to a scale of nanometers.

The coupled set of diﬀerential equations for the radius
of the ﬂuid jet h(z, t) and the axial velocity v(z, t), as
derived in [10], reads

where the prime refers to diﬀerentiation with respect to
the spatial variable. The ﬁrst equation (1) expresses mass
conservation, (2) is the momentum balance. All quanti-
ties are written in units of the intrinsic length and time
scales ℓν = ν2ρ/γ, tν = ν3ρ2/γ2, respectively. For later
convenience the Laplace pressure term is written in the
form G′ = h2κ′, κ being the mean curvature of the in-
terface. The Gaussian Langevin force is uncorrelated in
space and time,

< ξ(z1, t1)ξ(z2, t2) >= δ(z1 − z2)δ(t1 − t2),

(3)

and the dimensionless constant D = (6/π)ℓT /ℓν mea-
sures the strength of the noise contribution.

Since the derivative of the noise is an extremely sin-
gular quantity, it is useful to integrate (2) once, setting
0 p(x)dx, where p = h2v is the momentum. Thus

Figure 1 shows the collapse of a liquid thread of
propane 6nm in diameter as given by (4,5) with peri-
odic boundary conditions. The results agree well with
the computation shown in the supplementary Fig.1 of
[10], and in particular the proﬁle remains close to being
symmetric. Remembering that P is the velocity of the
ﬂuid times a typical volume, the multiplicative factor in
front of the random force in (5) corresponds to a rela-
tive increase in noise strength as pinch-oﬀ is approached.
This provides us with a simple physical picture for an
eﬀective force generated by ﬂuctuations. Namely, a ran-
dom ﬂuctuation which increases the thread radius also in-
creases its eﬀective mass, slowing done the motion. Any
ﬂuctuation towards a smaller neck radius, on the other
hand, accelerates the motion. On average, the ﬂuctua-
tions thus drive the thread towards breakup, in fact more
eﬀectively than surface tension as we will see below. One
should also note the similarity of (5) with the equation
describing directed percolation [14].

It is clear that conventional perturbative expansions
around the deterministic solution are doomed to fail in
describing this mechanism, since the noise makes a dom-
inant contribution. In fact, any average taken at a ﬁxed
time no longer makes sense for this problem, because
there is a ﬁnite probability for pinch-oﬀ to have occurred,
so the original formulation ceases to be valid. Thus a
valid description has to be conditioned on the event of
breakup to take place at a ﬁxed time t0.
It is then
natural to ask for the most probable sequence of proﬁles
that brings one from the initial condition to some ﬁnal
proﬁle at time t0, corresponding to a “typical” breakup

event. From a standard path integral description, us-
ing the Gaussian properties of ξ, one ﬁnds [3] that the
probability for such a path is

The ﬁrst equation (4) has no noise in it and has to
be treated as a constraint. To ﬁnd the most probable
path with ﬁxed end-points one derives the Euler-Lagrange
equation [15] for the variation in a = h2 and P , with the
constraint treated by adding a Lagrange multiplier ˜a( ˙a +
P ′′) to L. It is somewhat more convenient to pass to a
“Hamiltonian” description, introducing ˜P = ∂L/ ˙P as the
conjugate ﬁeld, in the literature on critical phenomena
also known as the “response” ﬁeld [16,17]. From this one
directly ﬁnds the Hamiltonian equations

“Optimal” paths such as those described by (8) have
recently enjoyed some popularity in the statistical me-
chanics literature [18,19]. However, there are two con-
ceptual diﬃculties associated with (8). The ﬁrst is that
the equation for ˜P contains a term that corresponds to
negative diﬀusion, so it cannot be integrated forward in
time. In [19] an ingeneous yet extremely elaborate com-
putational scheme was developed to deal with this prob-
lem, based on an initial guess of the complete evolution of
the proﬁles. In subsequent iterations, the physical ﬁelds
were always integrated forward in time, the conjugate
ﬁelds backward in time. A second, perhaps more serious
problem is that one does not know a priori what the ﬁnal
proﬁle is supposed to be, so it has to be guessed. Once a
solution is found, the probability of ﬁnding a given ﬁnal
proﬁle can be estimated by evaluating the probability of
the total path. This evidently amounts to a daunting
mathematical problem for a complicated system like (8).
Both problems can simultaneously be dealt with by
assuming that the solution is self-similar, as found for
the deterministic solution [11,20]. This means we assume
solutions for small |t′| = |t0 − t| to be of the form

where now the prime refers to diﬀerentiation with respect
to ξ. One notices immediately that (10) is invariant un-
der the transformation φ → Aφ and ψ → A2ψ, so in the
following it is enough to look for solutions with φ(0) = 1.
Physically meaningful solutions of the set (10) must
match onto an outer solution that is slowly varying on the
local timescale set by |t′| [11], which means that |t′| must
drop out of the similarity description for large arguments
ξ → ±∞. For the proﬁle φ this means that it must grow
like φ ∼ ξ2α at inﬁnity. We are looking for symmetric
solutions of (10), which were found not to exist for its
deterministic counterpart [11]. Amazingly, we found that
the subset of solutions of (10) with the correct asymptotic
behavior obey the second order linear equation

which is veriﬁed by substitution. Symmetric solutions of
(11) with ψ(0) = 3 are also related to the conﬂuent hyper-
geometric function [21] by ψ = 3F (−2α, 1/2, −ξ2/12).

solution of (11),(12) with α = 0.418.

This gives a complete description of the physical solu-
tions of (10), but one still has to ﬁnd the value of the
exponent α. To that end we compare the weight (6) of
solutions with diﬀerent α, to ﬁnd the one for which L is
minimum. From (8) we ﬁnd that

L =

dza ¯P + L0,

where the integration is over the small spatial region
where the similarity description applies and L0 is essen-
tially a constant as |t′| → 0.

Keeping the initial height h0 of the liquid bridge con-
t0
stant, we ﬁnd that the integral
0 L is dominated by
contributions from |t′| → 0 if α < 1/2. Thus in similar-
ity variables we have up to constants

(13)

The remaining task is to minimize (13) as a function of α.
The decay of the argument of the integral is like ξ4α−4,
so the integral converges for α < 3/4. We conclude that
(13) must have a minimum somewhere between α = 1/4
and 3/4.

To ﬁnd it, one has to do the integral numerically for
general α and ﬁnds αmin ≈ 0.418 < 1/2, consistent with
the assumptions made above. In particular, α is smaller
than 1, so surface tension becomes asymptotically sub-
dominant, and hence the singularity is driven by noise
alone. A more quantitative comparison with numerical
simulations requires considerably better statistics than
we are presently able to accumulate.

We have thus shown that the optimal path method can
be used to reveal qualitatively new features of nanoscale
ﬂows, namely a speed-up in pinching and symmetric pro-
ﬁles. It seems that this method is particularly well suited
to treat problems arising in the new science of nanoscale
devices. Typically one is interested in the most probable
or ’typical’ behavior that brings one to a certain end, say
to have a device complete a given motion. I claim that
the present method is tailored to this situation.

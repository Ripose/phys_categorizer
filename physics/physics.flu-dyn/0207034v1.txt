Abstract

The problem of non-perturbative description of stationary ﬂames with arbi-
trary gas expansion is considered. A general method for deriving equations
for the ﬂame front position is developed. On the basis of the Thomson circu-
lation theorem an implicit integral of the ﬂow equations is constructed. With
the help of this integral the ﬂow structure near the ﬂame front is determined,
and a closed system of equations for the ﬂame front position and a set of
auxiliary quantities is obtained. This system is shown to be quasi-local, and
its transverse representation is found. This representation allows reduction of
the system to a single equation for the ﬂame front position. The developed
approach is applied to the case of zero-thickness ﬂames.

I. INTRODUCTION

The process of ﬂame propagation presents an extremely complicated mathematical prob-
lem. The governing equations include the nonlinear ﬂow equations for the fuel and the
products of combustion, as well as the transport equations governing the heat conduction
and species diﬀusion inside the ﬂame front. Fortunately, in practice, an inner ﬂame scale
deﬁned by the latter processes is large compared to the ﬂame front thickness, implying that
the ﬂame can be considered as a gasdynamic discontinuity. The initial problem is reduced
thereby to a purely hydrodynamic problem of determining the propagation of a surface of
discontinuity in an incompressible ﬂuid, the laws of this propagation being determined by
the usual Navier-Stokes and continuity equations complemented by the jump conditions at
the surface, expressing the mass and momentum conservation across the ﬂame front. The
asymptotic methods developed in Refs. [1–3] allow one to express these conditions in the
form of a power series with respect to the small ﬂame front thickness.

Despite this considerable progress, however, a closed theoretical description of the ﬂame
propagation is still lacking. What is meant by the term “closed description” here is the
description of ﬂame dynamics as dynamics of the ﬂow variables on the ﬂame front surface.
Reduction of the system of bulk equations and jump conditions, mentioned above, to this
“surface dynamics” implies solving the ﬂow equations for the fuel and the combustion prod-
ucts, satisfying given boundary conditions and the jump conditions at the ﬂame front, and
has only been carried out asymptotically for the case θ
1, where θ is the gas expansion
coeﬃcient deﬁned as the ratio of the fuel density and the density of burnt matter [1,4–6].

Diﬃculties encountered in trying to obtain a closed description of ﬂames are conditioned

by the following two crucial aspects:

(1) Characterized by the ﬂow velocities which are typically well below the speed of sound,
deﬂagration represents an essentially nonlocal process, in the sense that the ﬂame-induced
gas ﬂows, both up- and downstream, strongly aﬀect the ﬂame front structure itself. A seeding
role in this reciprocal process is played by the Landau-Darrieus (LD) instability of zero
thickness ﬂames [7,8]. A very important factor of non-locality of the ﬂame propagation is the
vorticity production in the ﬂame, which highly complicates the ﬂow structure downstream.
In particular, the local relation between pressure and velocity ﬁelds upstream, expressed by
the Bernoulli equation, no longer holds for the ﬂow variables downstream.

(2) Deﬂagration is a highly nonlinear process which requires an adequate non-perturba-
tive description of ﬂames with arbitrary values of the ﬂame front slope. As a result of develop-
ment of the LD-instability, exponentially growing perturbations with arbitrary wavelengths
make any initially smooth ﬂame front conﬁguration corrugated. Characteristic size of the
20Lf given by
resulting ”cellular” structure is of the order of the cutoﬀ wavelength λc ∼
the linear theory of the LD-instability [3]; Lf is the ﬂame front thickness. The exponen-
tial growth of unstable modes is ultimately suppressed by the nonlinear eﬀects. Since for
arbitrary θ the governing equations do not contain small parameters, it is clear that the
LD-instability can only be suppressed by the nonlinear eﬀects if the latter are not small,
and therefore so is the ﬂame front slope.

The stabilizing role of the nonlinear eﬀects is best illustrated in the case of stationary
ﬂame propagation. Numerical experiments on 2D ﬂames with θ = 6
8 show that even

to derive an equation for the ﬂame front position in the framework of the perturbation
expansion in powers of (θ

This perturbative method gives results in a reasonable agreement with the experiment
only for ﬂames with θ
3, propagating in very narrow tubes (tube width of the order λc),
so that the front slope does not exceed unity. Flames of practical importance, however,
have θ up to 10, and propagate in tubes much wider than λc. As a result of development
of the LD-instability, such ﬂames turn out to be highly curved, which leads to a noticeable
increase of the ﬂame velocity. In connection with this, a natural question arises whether
it is possible to develop a non-perturbative approach to the ﬂame dynamics, closed in the
sense mentioned above, which would be applicable to ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion.
A deeper root of this problem is the following dilemma: On the one hand, ﬂame propaga-
tion is an essentially non-local process [see the point (1) above], on the other, this non-locality
itself is determined by the ﬂame front conﬁguration and the structure of gas ﬂows near the
front, so the question is whether an explicit bulk structure of the ﬂow downstream is nec-
essary in deriving an equation for the ﬂame front position. In other words, we look for an
approach which would provide the closed description of ﬂames more directly, without the
need to solve the ﬂow equations explicitly.

The purpose of this paper is to develop such approach in the stationary case.
The paper is organized as follows. The ﬂow equations and related results needed in our
investigation are displayed in Sec. II A. A formal integral of the ﬂow equations is obtained
in Sec. II B on the basis of the Thomson circulation theorem. With the help of this integral,
an exact ﬂow structure near the ﬂame front is determined in Sec. III. Using the jump
conditions for the velocity components across the ﬂame front, this result allows one to write
down a system of equations for the ﬂow variables and the ﬂame front position, which is
closed in the above-mentioned sense. This is done in the most general form in Sec. IV A.
It is remarkable that this system turns out to be quasi-local, which implies existence of the
transverse representation derived in Sec. IV B. The developed approach is applied to the
particular case of zero-thickness ﬂames in Sec. IV C, where a single equation for the ﬂame
front position is derived. The results obtained are discussed in Sec. V.

II. INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF FLOW DYNAMICS

As was mentioned in the point (1) of Introduction, an important factor of the ﬂow
non-locality downstream is the vorticity production in curved ﬂames, which highly compli-
cates relations between the ﬂow variables. In the presence of vorticity, pressure is expressed
through the velocity ﬁeld by an integral relation, its kernel being the Green function of the
Laplace operator. It should be noted, however, that the jump condition for the pressure
across the ﬂame front only serves as the boundary condition for determining an appropriate
Green function, being useless in other respects. Thus, it is convenient to exclude pres-
sure from our consideration from the very beginning. The basis for this is provided by the
well-known Thomson circulation theorem. Thus, we begin in Sec. II A with the standard for-
mulation of the problem of ﬂame propagation, and then construct a formal implicit solution
of the ﬂow equations with the help of this theorem in Sec. II B.

A. Flow equations

Let us consider a stationary ﬂame propagating in an initially uniform premixed ideal ﬂuid
in a tube of arbitrary width b. To make the mathematics of our approach more transparent,
we will be dealing below with the 2D case. Let the Cartesian coordinates (x, z) be chosen so
that z-axis is parallel to the tube walls, z =
being in the fresh fuel. It will be convenient
to introduce the following dimensionless variables

(η, ξ) = (x/R, z/R) , (w, u) = (vx/Uf , vz/Uf) ,

is the velocity of a plane ﬂame front, Pf

where Uf
is the initial pressure in the fuel far
ahead of the ﬂame front, and R is some characteristic length of the problem (e.g., the cut-
oﬀ wavelength). The ﬂuid density will be normalized on the fuel density ρ−. As always,
we assume that the process of ﬂame propagation is nearly isobaric. Then the velocity and
pressure ﬁelds obey the following equations in the bulk

Eq. (1), one obtains a 2D version of the Thomson circulation theorem

According to Eq. (3), the voticity σ is conserved along the stream lines. As a simple
consequence of this theorem, one can ﬁnd the general solution of the ﬂow equations upstream.
Namely, since the ﬂow is potential at ξ =
(u = V = const, w = 0, where V is the velocity
of the ﬂame in the rest frame of reference of the fuel), it is potential for every ξ < f (η), f (η)
denoting the ﬂame front position. Therefore,

The ﬁrst two terms on the right of Eq. (9) represent the potential component of the ﬂuid
velocity, while the third corresponds to the vortex component. The aim of the subsequent
calculation is to transform the latter to an integral over the ﬂame front surface. To this end,
we will decompose Σ into elementary ds as follows.

Let us take a couple of stream lines crossing the ﬂame front at points (η, f (η)) and
(η + ∆η, f (η + ∆η)) (see Fig. 1). Consider the gas elements moving between these lines,
which cross the front between the time instants t = 0 and t = ∆t. During this time interval,
these elements ﬁll a space element Σ0 adjacent to the ﬂame front. For suﬃciently small

the subscript“+” means that the corresponding quantity is evaluated just behind the ﬂame
front, i.e., for ξ = f (η) + 0, and vn
+ = vi+ni is the normal velocity of the burnt gas, ni being
the unit vector normal to the ﬂame front (pointing to the burnt matter). After another time
interval of the same duration ∆t, the elements move to a space element Σ1 adjacent to Σ0.
Since the ﬂow is incompressible, Σ1 is of the same volume as Σ0. Continuing this, the space
between the two stream lines turns out to be divided into an inﬁnite sequence of Σ’s of the
same volume, adjacent to each other. Thus, summing over all ∆η, the third term in Eq. (9)
can be written as

III. STRUCTURE OF THE VORTEX MODE

To determine the ﬂame front dynamics, it is suﬃcient to know the ﬂow structure near
the ﬂame front. As to the ﬂow upstream, it is described by Eqs. (4), (5) for all ξ < f (η).
Given the solution upstream, velocity components of the burnt gas at the ﬂame front can be
found from the jump conditions which express the mass and momentum conservation across
the front. On the other hand, these components are required to be the boundary values
(for ξ = f (η) + 0) of the velocity ﬁeld satisfying the ﬂow equations. As was shown in the
preceding section, the latter can be represented in the integral form, Eq. (12). Any velocity
ﬁeld can be arbitrarily decomposed into a potential and vortex modes. The former has the
form analogous to Eqs. (4), (5), namely

(14)

Our strategy thus will be to use the integral representation to determine the near-the-front
structure of the vortex mode described by the last term in Eq. (12).

Equation (12) reveals the following important fact. Up to a potential, the value of the
vortex mode at a given point (η, ξ) of the ﬂow downstream is determined by only one point
in the range of integration over (˜η, t), namely that satisfying

H(˜η, t) = η , Ξ(˜η, t) = ξ .

(15)

This is, of course, a simple consequence of the Thomson theorem underlying the above
derivation of Eq. (12). It can be veriﬁed directly by calculating the rotor of the right hand
side of Eq. (12): contracting this equation with εim∂m, using εikεim = δkm, and taking into
account relation

Now, let us take the observation point (ξ, η) suﬃciently close to the ﬂame front, i.e.,
ξ
f (η), [ξ > f (η)]. In view of what has just been said, the vortex component for such
points is determined by a contribution coming from the integration over ˜η, t near the ﬂame
front, which corresponds to small values of t. Integration over all other ˜η, t gives rise to a
potential contribution.

The small t contribution to the integral kernel K(η, ξ, ˜η) can be calculated exactly. For

such t’s, one can write

H(˜η, t)

˜η + w+(˜η)t , Ξ(˜η, t)

IV. CLOSED DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY FLAMES

After we have determined the near-the-front structure of the vortex component of the
gas velocity downstream, we can write down a closed system of equations governing the
stationary ﬂame propagation. As was explained in the Introduction, the term “closed”
means that these equations relate only quantities deﬁned on the ﬂame front surface, without
any reference to the ﬂow dynamics in the bulk. This system consists of the jump conditions
for the velocity components at the front, and the so-called evolution equation that gives
the local normal fuel velocity at the front as a function of the front curvature. These
equations (except for the evolution equation) are consequences of the mass and momentum
conservation across the ﬂame front. In Sec. IV A, we obtain the closed system in the most
general form, without specifying the form of the jump conditions, and then apply it to the
case of zero thickness ﬂames in Sec. IV C.

First of all, we need to ﬁnd the “on-shell” expression for the vortex component, i.e., its

The total velocity ﬁeld downstream is the sum of the potential mode having the form
Eqs. (13),(14), and the vortex mode. Let us denote the jump [vi+(η)
vi−(η)] of the gas
velocity vi across the ﬂame front as [vi]. Here v±i(η) = vi(η, f (η)

0). Then we can write

The jumps [vi] (as well as σ+) are quasi-local functions of the fuel velocity at the ﬂame
front, and of the ﬂame front shape. Two equations (29), together with Eqs. (5), (14), and
the evolution equation, vn
−(f ), form a closed system of ﬁve equations for the ﬁve
functions vi−(η), vp

− = vn
i+(η), and f (η).

It should be emphasized that this formulation implies that the potentials vi and vp
i are
explicitly expressed in the form of the Fourier series, Eqs. (4) and (13), respectively. Indeed,
relations (5), (14) between the ﬂow variables hold before the on-shell transition ξ

is performed, while Eq. (29) is formulated in terms of the on-shell variables v±i. Thus, the
above system is in fact a system of equations for the front position f (η) and two inﬁnite sets
of the Fourier coeﬃcients u(n), ¯u(n).

However, the form of the integral kernel in Eq. (29) makes it possible to avoid this consid-
erable complication, and to derive a much simpler formulation. This will be demonstrated
in the next section.

B. Transverse representation

The aforesaid simpliﬁcation is based on the fact that Eq. (29) is quasi-local. To show
this, we simply increase its diﬀerential order by one. Namely, diﬀerentiating this equation
with respect to η, taking into account relation

dχ(x)
dx

= 2δ(x) ,

and performing the trivial integration over ˜η, we get

i− + [vi]′ = (vp

i+)′ + Nσ+

(vn

− + [v2]

.

Given a point at the ﬂame front, Eq. (31) relates components of the fuel velocity at this
point and their derivatives at the same point. This property of quasi-locality implies ex-
istence of the transverse representation of Eq. (31). We say that a system of equations
is in the transverse representation if all operations involved in this system (diﬀerentiation,
integration) are only performed with the ﬁrst argument (η) of the ﬂow variables. In other
words, the ξ-dependence of the ﬂow variables in such system is purely parametric.

Now, let us show how the system of Eqs. (5), (14), and (31) can be brought to the
transverse form. All we have to do is to express the full η-derivatives in terms of the partial
ones. This is easily done using the continuity equation (1) and the potentiality of the ﬁelds

As to Eqs. (5), (14), they are already transverse. Finally, the evolution equation has general
form

where F is a quasi-local function of its arguments, proportional to the ﬂame front thickness,
and therefore can also be rendered transverse.

C. Zero-thickness ﬂames

As an illustration, the developed approach will be applied in this section to the case of

zero-thickness ﬂames.

In this case, the jump conditions for the velocity components have the form

It remains only to calculate the value of the vorticity at the ﬂame front, as a function
of the fuel velocity. This can be done directly using the ﬂow equations (1),(2), see Ref. [2].
With the help of Eqs. (5.32) and (6.15) of Ref. [2], the jump of the vorticity across the ﬂame
front can be written, in the 2D stationary case, as

Equation (50) provides the closed description of the stationary zero-thickness ﬂames in
the most convenient form. If desired, one can bring it to the explicitly real form by extracting
the real or imaginary part.2 Account of the eﬀects inside the thin ﬂame front changes the
right hand side of this equation to O(ε), ε = Lf /R being the relative ﬂame front thickness.

2Both ways, of course, lead to equivalent equations: Acting by the operator ˆH on the real part
gives the imaginary one, and vice versa.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The results of Sec. IV solve the problem of closed description of stationary ﬂames. The
) obtained in Sec. IV B gives a general recipe for deriving equations govern-
set of equations (
∗
ing the “surface dynamics” of the ﬁelds u, w, up, wp, or, more precisely, their ξ-independent
counterparts, υ, ω, υp, ωp, and the function f (η) – the ﬂame front position. Following this
way, we derived an equation for the front position of zero-thickness ﬂames, Eq. (50). This
equation is universal in that any surface of discontinuity, propagating in an ideal incom-
pressible ﬂuid, is described by Eq. (50) whatever internal structure of this “discontinuity”
be. The latter shows itself in the O(ε)-corrections to this equation, where ε is the relative
thickness of discontinuity. In the case of premixed ﬂame propagation, these corrections can
be found using the results of Refs. [2,3] following the general prescriptions of Sec. IV B. It is
clear that independently of the speciﬁc form of ε-corrections, the set (
) ultimately reduces
to a single equation for the function f (η), since equations of this set are linear with respect
to the ﬁeld υp . The latter can be eliminated, therefore, in the same way as in Sec. IV C.

∗

It is interesting to trace the inﬂuence of the boundary conditions on the form of Eq. (50).
By itself, expression (27) for the vortex mode is completely “covariant”, i.e., it has one and
the same vector form whatever boundary conditions. The jump conditions Eqs. (36), (37)
also can be rewritten in an explicitly covariant form as the conditions on the normal and
tangential components of the velocity. It is the structure of the potential mode upstream and
downstream, given by Eqs. (4), (13), respectively, which is directly aﬀected by the boundary
conditions for the velocity ﬁeld. Thus, it is the boundary conditions which dictate the way
the jump conditions appear in the ﬁrst two equations of the set (
), as well as the form of
the third and forth equations.

∗

Finally, it is worth to compare the results obtained in this paper and in Refs. [5,6] where
an equation describing stationary ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion was derived under
assumption that there exists a local relation between the pressure ﬁeld and a potential mode
of the velocity downstream, expressed by the Bernoulli-type equation.3 This assumption
was proved in Refs. [5,6] in the framework of perturbative expansion with respect to (θ
1)
up to the sixth order. Comparison of Eq. (50) and Eq. (40) of Ref. [6] now shows that
this assumption is generally wrong (that the two equations are not equivalent can be easily
veriﬁed, for instance, considering the large ﬂame velocity limit investigated in detail in Sec. V
of Ref. [6]). As we saw in Sec. II B, the use of the Thomson theorem makes investigation
of the pressure-velocity relation irrelevant to the purpose of deriving equation for the ﬂame
front position.

−

The results presented in this paper resolve the dilemma stated in the Introduction in the
case of stationary ﬂames. There remains the question of principle whether it can be resolved
in the general non-stationary case.

3This assumption goes back to the work [11] where it was introduced in investigating the nonlinear
development of the LD-instability.

APPENDIX: CONSISTENCY CHECK FOR EQ. (27)

the vorticity mode near the ﬂame front

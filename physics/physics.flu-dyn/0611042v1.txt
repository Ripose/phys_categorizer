Abstract

A type of super-hydrophobic surface consists of a solid plane boundary
with an array of grooves which, due to the eﬀect of surface tension, prevent
a complete wetting of the wall. The eﬀect is greatest when the grooves
are aligned with the ﬂow. The pressure diﬀerence between the liquid and
the gas in the grooves causes a curvature of the liquid surface resisted
by surface tension. The eﬀects of this surface deformation are studied in
this paper. The corrections to the eﬀective slip length produced by the
curvature are analyzed theoretically and a comparison with available data
and related mathematical models is presented.

1 Introduction

Large pressure drops are necessary to cause liquid ﬂow in micro- and nano-
channels. The small values of naturally occurring slip lengths on hydrophobi-
cally coated surfaces, typically of the order of some nanometers [1–4], are in
most cases insuﬃcient to signiﬁcantly aﬀect the required pressure gradients, as
also conﬁrmed by some theoretical analysis [5–7]. With the recent increasing
interest in such systems [8, 9], eﬀorts to reduce these large pressures have been
made. One promising avenue are the so-called super-hydrophobic surfaces [10–
15], in which the wall stress is decreased by reducing the liquid-solid contact
area [1, 9]. The idea is to cover the surface of interest with structures such as
posts, grooves, or others, over which the liquid surface remains suspended due
to the eﬀect of surface tension. The eﬀect is equivalent to the introduction of an
eﬀective slip length of a magnitude comparable with the size of the geometrical
features on the surface. This arrangement has been studied by several authors
both experimentally [10–12, 16] and theoretically [5, 7, 17–22].

1

Ou and co-workers [10, 11] investigated the performance of a microchannel
with a rectangular cross section the ﬂoor of which contained a series of grooves
aligned with the ﬂow. This conﬁguration resembles the situation studied the-
oretically by Philip [19] who considered a variety of such arrangements. In a
system of this type, the liquid surface becomes convex towards the gas occupying
the groove due to the high pressure in the channel, with the radius of curva-
ture determined by the balance of the pressure diﬀerence and surface tension.
The importance of this eﬀect, which was neglected by Philip, increases with
increasing pressure and may be expected to become signiﬁcant as the channel
size decreases and the pressure levels correspondingly increase. The purpose of
the present paper is to calculate the correction to the eﬀective slip length due
to this curvature. While the correction is small for the case considered by Ou
and co-workers, one can easily envisage practical cases in which the eﬀect would
be important. Our approach is perturbative and rests on the smallness of the
deformation of the free surface.

2 Curvature eﬀects on a periodic free shear pat-

tern: formulation of the problem

We consider a liquid ﬂowing in a rectangular channel the ﬂoor of which contains
equally spaced slots aligned with the ﬂow. Surface tension prevents the liquid
from ﬁlling the slots, but the pressure in the channel causes the liquid free
surfaces to bow into them.
If there is a suﬃcient number of slots, we can
consider the ﬂow as consisting of the periodic repetition of equal cells similar
to the one shown in ﬁgure 1. In this ﬁgure, the top boundary, at a distance
L∗ above the ﬂoor, is the roof of the channel, the dashed vertical lines are
periodicity boundaries, and the lower boundary of the liquid region consists of
< c∗, and
x∗
a free-slip portion along a free surface S, occupying the range
|
< H ∗/2, where H ∗ is the
a no-slip portions on either side of it, for c∗ <
dimensional cell width. Lengths will be rendered dimensionless with respect to
H ∗/2π, so that 0
c < π and L = 2πL∗/H ∗. It will also be convenient to
introduce a slip fraction deﬁned as

calculate the ﬂow rate in the channel

Q =

where A is the total cross-sectional area bounded by the solid walls and the free
surface.

One can deﬁne an eﬀective slip length λ by equating the actual ﬂow rate Q
with the ﬂow rate Qef f that would be found in a rectangular channel of height
L and width 2π with a partial-slip condition applied at the bottom wall:

wef f (x, 0) = λ ∂ywef f (x, 0) .

The ﬂow rate in this latter case is readily calculated:

3 Perturbation problem

With the small dimensions of practical interest, the curvature of the free surface
is small and we represent it in the form

in which the parameter ǫ, to be estimated presently, is taken to be small com-
pared to 1. With this approximation it is easy to show that, correct to ﬁrst
order in ǫ, the free-shear condition (5) is

y + ǫη(x) = 0

τyz + ǫ

τxz = 0

dη
dx

where τiz = ∂iw, i = x, y, denotes the only non-vanishing components of the
viscous stress. The smallness of ǫ suggests a perturbation approach to the
solution of the problem and we write

w = w(0) + ǫw(1) + o(ǫ) .

The ﬁeld w(0) satisﬁes (2) while w(1) is harmonic. Both satisfy the conditions
(3) and (4) on the solid and periodicity boundaries while, by a Taylor-series
expansion in ǫ, we ﬁnd the boundary conditions in the groove as

The pressure in the channel falls in the direction of the ﬂow, which will lead to
an axial variation of R. This eﬀect is usually suﬃciently slow [10, 11] as not to

where the ﬁrst term is the standard two-dimensional channel ﬂow proﬁle with
no-slip top and bottom walls and ˜w(0,L)(x, y) is the correction due to the free-
slip portion of the lower boundary. Evidently ˜w(0,L) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
with conditions (3) and (4) on the solid and periodicity boundaries, while

∂y ˜w(0,L)(x, 0) =

Since ˜w(0,L) is periodic in x and even, it can be expanded in a Fourier cosine
series in x, after which the requirement that it be harmonic determines the y

This problem was solved by Philip [19], but his procedure was diﬀerent from
that adopted here and it is shown in appendix A that his solution is correctly
recovered. The ﬂow rate Q(0) is readily calculated from (24) and (26):

For a ﬁnite height L, it does not seem possible to solve the dual-series equations
(27) and (28) exactly. We have calculated the solution numerically as explained
in appendix C. The case of inﬁnite depth can however be treated analytically
(appendix A). In particular, one ﬁnds

7 Summary and conclusions

Super-hydrophobic surfaces are necessary to signiﬁcantly aﬀect pressure gradi-
ents and facilitate liquid ﬂow in micron-scale channels. The super-hydrophobic
eﬀect is realized by patterning the channel walls with posts or grooves so that
the liquid forms a free surface and remains partially suspended away from the
wall due to the eﬀect of surface tension. While, on small scales, surface tension
is a powerful force, it cannot prevent the free surface from bulging out becoming
convex toward the gas space. This circumstance has two eﬀects. In the ﬁrst
place, the ﬂow passage is enlarged, which increases the slip length but, on the
other hand, the velocity ﬁeld is modiﬁed, which decreases it.

In this paper we have considered one special situation of this type – a ﬂat wall
with grooves parallel to the ﬂow direction – thus providing a natural generaliza-
tion of the analysis carried out by Philip [19] who assumed a ﬂat the liquid-gas
interface. We have quantiﬁed the two eﬀects mentioned before ﬁnding that the
magnitude of the ﬁrst one relative to the second one decreases proportionally
to the ratio of the pattern width to the channel height. For deep channels, the
more signiﬁcant eﬀect is the second one, given in (45) and shown in ﬁgure 3,
which we found to give a negative contribution to the slip length. Our results
are described in detail in section 6.

The magnitude of the eﬀect that we have studied is quantiﬁed by the dimen-

The only existing data with which our theory can be compared are those re-
ported by Ou and coworkers [10]. We can estimate from their ﬁgure 9 that the
air-water interface protrudes 2 to 4 µm below the channel ﬂoor. The spatial
period of the grooves on their lower wall is H ∗ = 60 µm. Our parameter ǫ is
therefore of the order of (2-4)/60 = 0.03-0.06, which produces only a very small
correction to the unperturbed solution. However, for periodicity patterns H ∗

In this appendix we solve the zeroth order problem for a channel of inﬁnite
depth. In this limit, the appropriate situation to consider is that of a linear
shear ﬂow over a periodic array of free-slip longitudinal strips. We write the
velocity ﬁeld as the sum of a linear shear ﬂow plus a perturbation ( ˜w(0,∞)):

Figure 1: Schematic geometry of the problem studied in this paper. The ﬂoor
of a channel with height L∗ contains a series of regularly spaced grooves parallel
to the ﬂow direction. When the number of grooves is large, the situation can
be approximated by the periodic repetition of a fundamental cell of width H ∗
such as the one shown here. The width of the the groove, where the shear stress
is essentially zero, is 2c∗. For small deformation, the maximum penetration of
the free surface S into the groove is δ∗ = (c∗)2/2R∗ where R∗ is the radius of
curvature of the free surface.

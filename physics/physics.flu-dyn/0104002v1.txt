Abstract

The collision of a plane parallel shock wave with a plane parallel cloud of uniform density is
analysed for the case in which magnetic ﬁelds and radiative losses are not considered. General
analytic solutions are discussed for the case in which the density of the cloud is greater than that
of the surrounding environment. This problem generalises one of the classical problems in gas
dynamics: the collision between a shock wave and a solid wall.

Introduction

1
§
The problem of the collision of a shock wave with a cloud has been intensely investigated in the
past by several authors (see for example Klein et al. 1994 and references therein). The simplest
assumption to make is to consider a cloud for which gravitational eﬀects are not considered, magnetic
ﬁelds are non-important and radiative losses are negligible. The fact that gravity is not taken
into account, makes it possible to consider the density of the cloud as uniform. The complete 3D
hydrodynamical problem is extremely complicated, even under the simpliﬁcations mentioned above.
However, numerical simulations have been done for this case which ultimately give rise to instabilities
causing a complete disruption of the cloud (Klein et al., 1994).

This article describes how the solution of the one dimensional problem can be obtained. It has
been argued in the past that at least for the case in which the density contrast is high, i.e. the ratio
of the cloud’s density to that of the external environment is high, the problem has to be very similar
to the one found in the problem of a collision of a plane parallel shock with with a solid wall (Spitzer
1982, McKee 1988).

Many Astrophysical phenomena give rise to collisions between a shock wave and a cloud. For
example, when a supernova explosion occurs, the intense ejection of energy from the supernova into
the interstellar medium produces a spherical shock wave which expands into the interstellar medium.
Several examples exist for which collisions of this expanding shock have been observed to interact

with clouds embedded in the interstellar medium. This interaction is very important, since it seems to
induce, under not very well known circumstances, gravitational collapse and star formation (Herbst
and Assousa, 1979). Another scenario is presented by the expansion of jets around active galactic
nuclei. A pair of jets expand in opposite directions from the nuclei of the galaxy creating a bow
shock which interacts with the intergalactic medium. It is the interaction of this expanding bow
shock with clouds or galaxies embedded in cluster of galaxies that provides a mechanism in which
shock–cloud interactions take place. It seems that this interaction is able to induce star formation
very eﬃciently∗.

Having all this considerations in mind, the present paper aims to give a simple way of solving
a particular case of the whole problem. This article provides an analytic description of the one
dimensional problem of a collision between a plane parallel shock with a plane parallel “cloud”
bounded by two tangential discontinuities. It is assumed that the speciﬁc volume in the cloud is a
quantity of the ﬁrst order, in other words solutions are given for the case in which the density of the
cloud is much greater than that of the surrounding environment.

2 General Description of the problem
§
Consider two plane parallel inﬁnite tangential discontinuities. The cloud, or internal region to the
tangential discontinuities has uniform pressure pc and density ρc. The environment, or external region
to the cloud has also uniform values of pressure p1 and density ρ1 respectively. A plane parallel shock
wave is travelling in the positive x direction and eventually will collide with the left boundary of the
cloud at time t = t0 < 0. For simplicity we assume from now on that the density of the cloud is greater
than that of the environment. By knowing the pressure p2 and density ρ2 behind the shock wave, it
is possible to solve the hydrodynamical problem thus deﬁned.

The problem of the collision of a shock wave and a tangential discontinuity is well known (Landau
and Lifshitz, 1987). Since at the instantaneous time of collision the values of, say, the density in
front and behind the shock are ρc and ρ2 respectively, the standard jump conditions for a shock no
longer hold. A discontinuity in the initial conditions (ﬁrst initial discontinuity) occurs.

When a discontinuity in the initial conditions occurs, the values of the hydrodynamical quantities
need not to have any relation at all between them at the surface of discontinuity. However, certain
relations need to be valid in the gas if stable surfaces of discontinuity are to be created. For instance,
the Rankine-Hugoniot relations have to be valid in a shock wave. What happens is that this initial
discontinuity splits into several discontinuities, which can be of one of the three possible types: shock
wave, tangential discontinuity or weak discontinuity. This newly formed discontinuities move apart
from each other with respect to the plane of formation of the initial discontinuity.

Very general arguments show that only one shock wave or a pair of weak discontinuities bounding
a rarefaction wave can move in opposite directions with respect to the point in which the initial
discontinuity took place. For, if two shock waves move in the same direction, the shock at the front
would have to move, relative to the gas behind it, with a velocity less than that of sound. However,
the shock behind must move with a velocity greater than that of sound with respect to the same gas.
In other words, the leading shock will be overtaken by the one behind. For exactly the same reason
a shock and a rarefaction wave can not move in the same direction, and this is due to the fact that
weak discontinuities move at the velocity of sound relative to the gas they move through. Finally,
two rarefaction waves moving in the same direction can not become separated, since the velocities of
their boundaries with respect to the gas they move through is the same.

Boundary conditions demand that a tangential discontinuity must remain in the point where the
initial discontinuity took place. This follows from the fact that the discontinuities formed as a result
of the initial discontinuity must be such that they are able to take the gas from a given state at one
side of the initial discontinuity to another state in the opposite side. The state of the gas in any one

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
§

dimensional problem in hydrodynamics is given by three parameters (say the pressure, the density
and the velocity of the gas). A shock wave however, is represented by only one parameter as it seen
from the shock adiabatic relation (Hugoniot adiabatic) for a polytropic gas:

=

(γ + 1)pf + (γ

−

where p and V stand for pressure and speciﬁc volumes respectively, γ is the polytropic index of
the gas and the subscripts f and b label the ﬂow in front of and behind the shock. For a given
thermodynamic state of the gas ( i.e. for given pf and Vf ) the shock wave is determined completely
since, for instance, pb would depend only on Vb according to the shock adiabatic relation. On the
other hand, a rarefaction wave is also described by a single parameter. This is seen from the equations
which describe the gas inside a rarefaction wave which moves to the left with respect to gas at rest
beyond its right boundary (Landau and Lifshitz, 1987):

where c4 and cR represent the sound speed behind and inside the rarefaction wave respectively. The
magnitude of the velocity of the ﬂow inside the rarefaction wave is wR in that system of reference.
The quantities p4 and pR are the pressures behind and inside the rarefaction wave respectively. The
corresponding values of the density in the regions just mentioned are ρ4 and ρR.

With only two parameters at hand, it is not possible to give a description of the thermodynamic
state of the gas.
It is the tangential discontinuity, which remains in the place where the initial
discontinuity was produced, that accounts for the third parameter needed to describe the state of
the ﬂuid.

When a shock wave hits a tangential discontinuity, a rarefaction wave can not be transmitted to
the other side of the gas bounded by the tangential discontinuity. For, if there would be a transmitted
rarefaction wave to the other side of the tangential discontinuity, the only possible way the boundary
conditions could be satisﬁed is if a rarefaction wave is reﬂected back to the gas. In other words,
two rarefaction waves separate from each other in opposite directions with respect to the tangential
discontinuity that is left after the interaction. In order to show that this is not possible, consider a
shock wave travelling in the positive x direction, which compresses gas 1 into gas 2 and collides with
a tangential discontinuity. After the interaction two rarefaction waves separate from each other and
a tangential discontinuity remains between them. In the system of reference where the tangential
dpdV , where p3 is the pressure of gas
discontinuity is at rest, the velocity of gas 2 is v2 =
3 surrounding the tangential discontinuity. Accordingly, the velocity of gas 1 in the same system of

incident shock to exist, it is necessary that v1 > v2, so two rarefaction waves can not be formed as a
result of the interaction.

So far, it has been shown that after the collision between the shock and the boundary of the
cloud, a ﬁrst initial discontinuity is formed. This situation can not occur in nature in any manner
and the shock splits into a shock which penetrates the cloud and either one of a shock, or a rarefaction
wave (bounded by two weak discontinuities) is reﬂected from the point of collision. With respect
to the point of formation of the initial discontinuity, boundary conditions demand that a tangential
discontinuity must reside in the region separating the discontinuities previously formed.

In a shock wave, the velocities (v) in front and behind the shock are related to one another by

their diﬀerence:

where the subscripts f and b label the ﬂow of the gas in front and behind the shock wave.

If after the ﬁrst initial discontinuity two shock waves separate with respect to the point of collision,

then according to eq.(2.6) the velocities of their front ﬂows are given by vc =
V3), where the regions 3 and 3′ bound the tangential discontinuity which
(p3 −

(2.7)

where γ and γc represent the polytropic indexes of the environment and the cloud respectively. V1 and
Vc are the speciﬁc volumes on the corresponding regions. In other words, a necessary and suﬃcient
condition for having a reﬂected shock from the boundary of the two media, under the assumption of
initial pressure equilibrium between the cloud and the environment, is given by eq.(2.7). Since for
the problem in question V1 > Vc and the polytropic indexes are of the same order of magnitude, a
reﬂected shock is produced.

In the same form, at time t = 0 when the transmitted shock reaches the right tangential discon-
tinuity located at x = 0, another (second) initial discontinuity must occur. In this case, we must
invert the inequality in eq.(2.7), change γ by γc and p2 by p3, where p3 is the pressure behind the
shocks produced by the ﬁrst initial discontinuity. Again, using the same argument for the poly-
tropic indexes, it follows that after this interaction a weak discontinuity bounded by two rarefaction
waves must be reﬂected from the boundary between the two media. As a result of the interaction,
once again, boundary conditions demand that a tangential discontinuity remains between the newly
formed discontinuities.

This situation continues until the rarefaction wave and the left tangential discontinuity of the
cloud collide at time t = τ > 0. At this point, two rarefaction waves separating from each other
from the point of formation will be produced once a stationary situation is reached, and a tangential
discontinuity will be separating the newly formed discontinuities. One can continue in a somewhat
indeﬁnite manner with the solution but, for the sake of simplicity the calculations are stopped at this
point. Fig.(1) shows a schematic description of the solution described above in a system of reference
such that the tangential discontinuities which are left as a result of the diﬀerent interactions are at
rest. The numbers in the ﬁgure label diﬀerent regions in the ﬂow.

Figure 1: An incoming shock travelling to the right (top panel) hits a tangential discontinuity at time t0 < 0. This
produces two shocks moving in opposite directions with respect to the place of formation (middle panel). When the
transmitted shock into the cloud (region C) collides with its right boundary a reﬂected rarefaction wave (region R)
bounded by two tangential discontinuities and a shock transmitted to the external medium (lower panel) are formed.
Arrows represent direction of diﬀerent boundaries, or the ﬂow itself. The numbers in the ﬁgure label diﬀerent regions
of the ﬂow. Dashed lines represent shocks, dash-dot are weak discontinuities and continuous ones are tangential
discontinuities. The system of reference is chosen such that the tangential discontinuities which are left as a result of
the collisions are always at rest.

3 First initial discontinuity
§
According to ﬁg.(1), after the ﬁrst initial discontinuity the absolute values of the velocities (v) of the
ﬂow are related by:

With the aid of eq.(2.6), the velocities of eq(3.1) are given by:

v2 + vc = v2i.

v2
c = (p3 −
v2
2 = (p3 −

p1)(V1 −
p1)(Vc −
p2)(V2 −

V2),
V3′),
V3).

Inserting eqs.(3.2)-(3.4) into eq.(3.1) and substituting for the speciﬁc volumes from eq.(2.1), one
ends with a relation which relates the pressure p3 as a function of p2, p1 and the polytropic indexes
in an algebraic linear form. Straightforward manipulations show that the resulting equation does
not have an easy analytic solution, even for the particular cases in which a strong or weak incident
shock collides with the cloud.

In order to ﬁnd a set of analytic solutions, let us ﬁrst describe a particular solution to the problem.
If we consider a cloud with an initial inﬁnite density -a solid wall, then eq.(3.1) takes the form v2 = v2i,
and a “zeroth order” solution is found (Landau and Lifshitz, 1987):

where p30 is the value of the pressure behind the reﬂected and transmitted shocks for the case in
which the cloud has speciﬁc volume Vc = 0. For this particular case, eq.(3.5) determines p30 as a
function of p1 and p2, which are initial conditions to the problem. Due to the fact that the gas is
polytropic, this relation is the required solution to the problem.

In order to get a solution more adequate to the general case, we can approximate the whole

solution under the assumption that Vc is a quantity of the ﬁrst order, so:

p3 = p30 + p⋆
3,
V3 = V30 + V ⋆
3 ,
V3′ = V ⋆
3′,

where the quantities with a star are of the ﬁrst order and the subscript 0 represents the values at
zeroth order approximation. Substitution of eqs.(3.6)-(3.8) into eqs.(3.3)-(3.4) gives:

The dashed curve is the solution at ﬁrst order approximation for which the cloud’s speciﬁc volume is a quantity of
the ﬁrst order. The acoustic approximation for which the incident shock is weak, at the same order of accuracy, is
represented by a dot-dashed curve. The perturbed solutions were plotted assuming ρc/ρ1 = 100 for polytropic indexes

and ζ
1 in the weak limit. Fig.(2) shows a plot of the pressure p3 as a function of the
strength of the incident shock. It is interesting to note that even for very strong incident shocks the
ratio p3/p2 diﬀers from zero, which follows directly from eq.(3.5) and eq.(3.15). This simple means
that the reﬂected shock is not strong, no matter the initial conditions chosen.

There are certain important general relations for which the above results are a consequence
of. Firstly, by deﬁnition the pressure p2 behind the shock is greater than the pressure p1 of the
p1, it follows that the
environment. Now consider a strong incident shock, then since p3 > p2 ≫
transmitted shock into the cloud is very strong. Also, the reﬂected shock does not have to compress
too much the gas behind it to acquire the required equilibrium, so it is not a strong shock. This last
statement is in agreement with eq.(3.15). In general, for any strength of the incident shock, since
the inequality p3 > p2 > p1 holds, continuity demands that the reﬂected shock can not be strong and,
more importantly, that the penetrating shock is always stronger than the reﬂected one.

Secondly, very general inequalities are satisﬁed by the velocities v2, vc, vsl as deﬁned in ﬁg.(1).

For instance:

vsl > v2.

(3.17)

Indeed, since V3v2/(V3 −
to mass ﬂux conservation across the reﬂected shock, the result follows.

V2) > v2 holds, and the left hand side of this inequality is just vsl according

On the other hand, from eq.(3.3) and eq.(3.4), since p2 > p1 it follows that a necessary and
V3′. This last condition is satisﬁed
V3 > Vc −
suﬃcient condition for v2 > vc to be true is that V2 −
for suﬃciently small values of Vc. To give an estimate of the smallness of the cloud’s speciﬁc volume
needed, note that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for V2−

V3′ to be valid is:

In the same fashion, under the assumption that the polytropic

indexes are of the same order of magnitude, eq.(3.19) implies Vc < V1, which was an initial assumption.
Although eq.(3.19) is not suﬃcient, due to the fact that Vc is a ﬁrst order quantity we can use in
what follows:

The inequalities in eq.(3.17) and eq.(3.20) will prove to be useful later when we choose a more

suitable reference system to describe the problem in question.

v2 > vc.

4 Second initial discontinuity
§
Let us now analyse the situation for which 0 < t < τ . To begin with let us prove that:

w1 < v2 + vc ≡

u2,

where the velocities w1, v2 and vc are deﬁned in ﬁg.(1). Suppose that the inequality in eq.(4.1) is not
valid, then, by expressing the velocities as function of the speciﬁc volumes and pressures by means
of eq.(2.6) and the fact that p2 > p1, p3 > p4 and V4′ > V3, it follows that ρ3 > ρc; then as the cloud’s
density grows without limit, so does ρ3. Necessarily, eq.(4.1) has to be valid for suﬃciently small
values of the cloud’s speciﬁc volume. It is important to point out that since w2 =
w1,
the gas in region 2 as drawn in ﬁg.(1) travels in the positive x direction. According to ﬁg.(1) ﬂows
in region 1 and 3 are related by

= u2 −

u2 −
|

w1|

w1 −

w3 = vc,

Let us now prove a very general property of the solution. Regions 2 and 3 are related to one
another by the shock adiabatic relation. Since the gas in regions 3′ and 4 obey a polytropic equation
of state p3/p4 = (V4/V3′)γc , it follows that:

γc (γ + 1)V2 −
(γ + 1)V3 −
Now, due to the fact that V3′ < V4 < V1 V3 < V2 < V1 and γ, γc > 1 for a reasonable equation of state,
this relation can be brought to the form

according to the shock adiabatic relation. This result implies that most of the energy from the
incoming shock has been injected to the cloud, no matter how strong the initial incident shock is.
Only a very small amount of this energy is transmitted to the external gas that lies in the other side
of the cloud. Note that this result is of a very general nature since no assumptions about the initial
density contrast of the environment were made.

In order to continue with a solution at ﬁrst order approximation in Vc, note that we have to use

eqs.(3.6)-(3.8) together with:

5 General solution
§
Having found values for the pressures p⋆
4 as a function of the initial conditions p1, p2, V1
and Vc, the problem is completely solved. Indeed, using the shock adiabatic relation V2 is known.
With this, the values of V ⋆
4′ are determined by means of eq.(3.12), eq.(3.13), eq.(4.9)
and eq.(4.10) respectively. The complete values for pressure and speciﬁc volumes are obtained thus
with the aid of eqs.(3.6)-(3.8) and eqs.(4.4)-(4.6). The velocities of the ﬂow, as deﬁned in ﬁg.(1),
are calculated either by mass ﬂux conservation on crossing a shock, or by the formula given for the
velocity discontinuity in eq.(2.6). The hydrodynamical values of the pressure pR and density ρR
inside the rarefaction wave come from eqs.(2.2)-(2.5).

In order to analyse the variations of the hydrodynamical quantities as a function of position and
time, let us now describe the problem in a system of reference in which the gas far away to the
right of the cloud is always at rest, as presented in ﬁg.(4). Let xtl and xtr be the coordinates of the
left and right tangential discontinuities, xsl and xsr the coordinates of the reﬂected and transmitted
shocks produced after the ﬁrst initial discontinuity, χsr the position of the transmitted shock after

Figure 4: Description of the problem of a collision of a shock with a cloud in a system of reference for which the
gas far away to the right (at x = ∞) is always at rest. Originally a shock is travelling to the right and hits a tangential
discontinuity (top panel). This produces a discontinuity in the initial conditions so a reﬂected and transmitted shock
are produced; the gas in the cloud begins to accelerate (middle panel). Eventually the transmitted shock into the
cloud collides with its right boundary producing a “reﬂected” rarefaction wave bounded by two weak discontinuities
(region R) and a transmitted shock into the external medium (lower panel). In this system of reference every single
discontinuity produced by means of the interaction move to the right, except for the reﬂected shock produced after
the ﬁrst collision. Arrows represent the direction of motion of various boundaries and direction of ﬂow. Numbers label
diﬀerent regions of the ﬂow. Dashed lines represent shock waves, dash-dotted ones weak discontinuities and continuous
ones tangential discontinuities.

The direction of motion of the ﬂow is shown in ﬁg.(4) and it follows from eq.(3.17), eq.(3.20) and
eq.(5.2) that usl points to the left in this system of reference. Since, in the same frame, vc and w1
point to the right, continuity across a weak discontinuity demands νR to do it in the same way.

The tangential discontinuities and the shocks produced by the initial discontinuities move with
constant velocity throughout the gas. This implies that the time at which the ﬁrst initial discontinuity
takes place is:

where ∆ represents the initial width of the cloud. Hence, the positions of all diﬀerent discontinuities
for t0 < t < 0 are:

The time τ at which the left tangential discontinuity collides with the left boundary of the rarefaction
wave is given by xtl = xa, and thus:

τ c3′ = vct0 + ∆.

Fig.(5) shows the variation of the pressure and density as a function of time and position in a system
of reference in which the gas far away to the right of the cloud is at rest.

The width of the cloud varies with time, and it follows from eq.(5.9) and eq.(5.13) that this

variation is given by:

where Θ(t) is the Heaviside step function. This linear relation is plotted in ﬁg.(6).

6 Summary
§
The problem of a collision of a plane parallel shock wave with a high density cloud bounded by two
plane parallel tangential discontinuities has been discussed. Radiation losses, magnetic ﬁelds and
self gravity of the cloud were neglected. General analytic solutions were found for the simple case in
which the ratio of the environment’s density to that of the cloud’s density is a quantity of the ﬁrst
order.

When the shock collides with the boundary of the cloud, a discontinuity in the initial conditions
is produced. This splits the incoming shock into two shock waves: one which penetrates the cloud
and one which is reﬂected back to the external medium. When the transmitted shock into the cloud
reaches the opposite boundary, another discontinuity in the initial conditions is produced, causing
the transmission of a shock wave to the external medium and the reﬂection of a rarefaction wave
from the point of collision.

environment) as a function of position x (normalised to the initial width of the cloud ∆) and dimensionless time t (in
units of the time ∆/c1 –where c1 is the speed of sound in the external medium). Dashed lines represent shock waves
(S), dot-dashed lines are tangential discontinuities (T), which are boundaries of the cloud, and short-long dashed lines
represent weak discontinuities (W), which bound a rarefaction wave. The system of reference was chosen so that gas
far away to the right of the diagram is at rest. The diagram shows the case for which ρc/ρ1 = 104, and the polytropic
indices correspond to a monoatomic gas.

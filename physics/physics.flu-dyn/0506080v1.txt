Abstract
The resonance frequencies and oscillation phases of three acoustically coupled bubbles are ex-
amined to show that avoided crossings can appear in a multibubble system. Via a simple coupled
oscillator model, we show that if at least three bubbles exist, it is possible for their resonance
frequencies as functions of the separation distances between the bubbles to experience an avoided
crossing. Furthermore, by focusing our attention on the oscillation phases and based on analysis
of the transition frequencies [Ida, Phys. Lett. A 297, 210 (2002); Ida, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 71, 1214
(2002)] of the coupled bubbles, we show that a distinct state exchange takes place between the
bubbles at a point in the avoided crossing region, where a resonance frequency of the triple-bubble
system crosses with a transition frequency not corresponding to the resonance frequencies.

INTRODUCTION

Avoided crossings [1] have been observed theoretically and experimentally in a large
variety of physical systems involving eigenvalues (e.g., natural frequencies, eigenenergies)
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], and they have attracted much attention
even in recent years because of their rich physics and practical importance in, for example,
mechanical engineering [11, 12, 13, 14] and quantum physics [2, 3, 4, 5]. In the avoided
crossing regions, eigenvalues of the system ﬁrst approach each other as a system parameter
is varied but then veer abruptly from each other without crossing. In those regions a drastic
change of some characteristic of the system occurs along the eigenvalue loci. In Ref. [12], for
example, Pierre illustrated that the mode shapes of a disordered chain of coupled pendulums
change in the regions where avoided crossings of the eigenfrequencies of the system take
place. In that study, disorders in the lengths of the pendulums were used as the system
parameters. Also, in Ref. [2], Walkup et al. studied in detail avoided crossings observed in
the energy levels of diamagnetic hydrogen as functions of the magnetic ﬁeld strength or the
angular momentum, which lead to the diabatic exchange of the states of the wave functions.
A study of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [5] showed that in order to trap molecules
created in an atomic BEC through a Feshbach resonance, an avoided crossing of two bound
states of the molecules must be exploited, through which the vibrational quantum number
and size of the trapped molecules change.

In the present paper, we show theoretically that avoided crossings can be observed in
acoustically coupled bubbles, which has to the authors’ knowledge not been stated in the
literature. Furthermore, based on analyses of transition frequencies [16, 17], we propose a
way to detect a state exchange occurring in the avoided crossing region. The theoretical
model used in this study, reviewed in Sec. II, is a forced coupled oscillator model that
describes acoustic coupling of pulsating bubbles. Using the model, we show in Sec. III that
if at least three bubbles exist, it is possible that the resonance frequencies of the bubbles
exhibit avoided crossing when they are plotted as functions of the separation distances
between the bubbles. As has been demonstrated (e.g., Refs. [16, 18]), in double-bubble
systems, neither crossings nor avoided crossings of the resonance frequencies as functions
of the separation distance are observed, since the higher of the two resonance frequencies
of the systems increases and the lower one decreases as the bubbles approach each other.
However, as shown in the present paper, by introducing one more bubble whose monopole
(i.e., decoupled) resonance frequency crosses with one of the resonance frequencies of a
double-bubble system, one can observe the avoided crossing of the resonance frequencies
when all three bubbles are coupled.

In Sec. IV, we examine the phase properties of the three coupled bubbles to show that
a state exchange actually occurred between the bubbles in the avoided crossing region. In
this eﬀort, the notion of a transition frequency plays an important role. The transition
frequencies introduced in Refs. [16, 17] are characteristic frequencies of acoustically coupled
bubbles, around which the oscillation phase of bubbles inverts, e.g., from in-phase to out-of-
phase with the driving sound. It was proved in Ref. [17] that a bubble in a N-bubble system
has up to 2N − 1 transition frequencies, only N ones of which correspond to the resonance
frequencies of the system. That is, observing the transition frequencies allows us to obtain
richer insights into the phase properties than that obtained by only observing the resonance
frequencies. This notion has already been exploited as a powerful tool to understand the
sign reversal of the secondary Bjerknes force [18, 19] in which the oscillation phases play a

2

crucial role. Using the notion and observing directly the oscillation phases, we show that
the coupled bubbles exchange their oscillation states through the avoided crossing and the
state exchange takes place at the separation distances where an avoided crossing resonance
frequency crosses with a transition frequency that is not a resonance frequency. The present
ﬁndings appear to reveal a taste of bubbles’ hidden complexity.

Section V summarizes this paper, and the Appendixes present additional remarks.

II. COUPLED OSCILLATOR MODEL, RESONANCE FREQUENCY, AND
TRANSITION FREQUENCY

frequency of bubble i, deﬁned as

δi is the damping factor, the overdots denote the time derivation, pex is the pressure of
the external sound, ρ is the density of the surrounding liquid, Di j (= Dj i) is the separation
distance between the centers of bubbles i and j, κi is the polytropic exponent of the gas inside
the bubbles, P0 is the static pressure, and σ is the surface tension. In this linear model,
the following assumptions are made: the surrounding liquid is incompressible, the sound
amplitude is suﬃciently low, the separation distances are much larger than the bubbles’
radii, and the shape deformation of the bubbles is negligible. The last term of Eq. (1),
representing the pressures of the sounds that the neighboring bubbles emit, describes the
acoustic coupling between the bubbles. As in the double-bubble case [20], this model may
be assumed to be of third order with respect to the inverse of the separation distances (i.e.,
the truncated terms are of fourth or higher order); see Appendix A.

Using this model with N = 3, a matrix equation for determining the amplitudes and
phases of the radial oscillations is derived. Assuming pex = −Pa exp(iωt) and ei = βi exp(iωt)
with Pa being a positive constant, ω being the driving (angular) frequency, and βi being a
complex amplitude, we have

and I = (1, 1, 1)T . We should note here that essentially the same matrix equations can be

where |A| and C are the determinant and the cofactor matrix of A, respectively, and |A|∗
is the complex conjugate of |A|. We used here an expression in which the denominator is
real.

The eigenfrequencies of the system are determined by

which is a cubic equation in terms of X. For δi ≈ 0, the roots of this equation are equivalent
to the resonance frequencies of the system. The transition frequencies of bubble i, deﬁned
as the driving frequencies at which the phase diﬀerence between bubble i and the driving
sound is π/2 (or 3π/2) [16, 17, 18], are determined by

where

in Ref. [17], one knows that Eq. (8) is a ﬁfth-order polynomial in terms of X, meaning that
the bubbles may have up to ﬁve transition frequencies.

The phase delay of bubble i, denoted by φi, measured from the phase of the driving sound
is determined using the atan2(y, x) function in the C language, which returns tan−1(y/x) ∈
[−π, π], as

The next section shows that in certain cases an avoided crossing is observed in the solution of
Eq. (7). In the discussion, to obtain real eigenfrequencies that correspond to the resonance
frequencies of the triple-bubble system for weak damping, we for the moment assume δi ≈ 0
(but δi 6= 0). Under this assumption, one obtains

III. AVOIDED CROSSINGS OF RESONANCE FREQUENCIES

To begin with, a double-bubble system is brieﬂy reconsidered to conﬁrm that no avoided
crossings are observed in the resonance frequencies of the system as functions of the separa-
tion distance. The solid lines in Fig. 1 indicate the resonance frequencies of two coupled bub-
bles (bubbles 1 and 2) of (R10, R20) = (50 µm, 51 µm) as functions of l12 = D12/(R10 + R20).
The other parameters are set to ρ = 1000 kg/m3, κi = 1.4 (i = 1, 2, 3), P0 = 1 atm,
and σ = 0.0728 N/m. As has been proved theoretically [16, 20, 23, 24], two resonance (or
natural) frequencies appear in this system, each of which, for D12 → ∞, converges to the
monopole resonance frequency of a bubble. The higher resonance frequency increases and
the lower decreases as the separation distance decreases. It is therefore obvious that avoided
crossings cannot occur.

Here we introduce one more bubble into the system. The dashed line displayed in Fig. 1
denotes the monopole resonance frequency of the introduced bubble, bubble 3, whose radius
R30 = 51.5 µm. Note that this resonance frequency crosses with a resonance frequency of
the double-bubble system. This crossing, as shown immediately, triggers an avoided crossing
when the third bubble is coupled with the double-bubble system.

Figure 2 shows the resonance frequencies in the case where all three bubbles are coupled.
The separation distances are set to D12 = l12(R10 + R20), D23 = l23(R20 + R30), and D31 =
D12 + D23; that is, the bubbles are arranged in line (see Fig. 3(a)). Here the nondimensional
quantities l12 and l23 are used as the system parameters. Figures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) show
the results for l23 = 100 [25], 50, and 20, respectively. In the ﬁgures, an avoided crossing
is clearly seen that takes place around the point at which the two decoupled resonance
frequencies cross. The line of the resonance frequency originating with bubble 3 is divided
into two parts, and each of them connects smoothly, like blending, with the curve of a
resonance frequency of the double-bubble system, also divided into two parts. As bubble
3 comes closer to the others, the avoided crossing becomes broader and the origin of each
resonance frequency becomes increasingly unclear.

An avoided crossing is also observed when bubble 3 is smaller than the others. Figure
4 shows the resonance frequencies when R30 = 49.5 µm. Here the bubbles are arranged
as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). If bubble 3 is so large or so small that its monopole resonance
frequency does not cross with a resonance frequency of the double-bubble system, no distinct
avoided crossing is observed, though this situation is not shown here.

IV. STATE EXCHANGE IN THE AVOIDED CROSSING REGION

To manifest a state exchange like that which the coupled bubbles experience through the
avoided crossing, we examined the oscillation phases of the bubbles. In bubble dynamics,
the phase of radial oscillation plays important roles in many situations, including acoustic
levitation [26, 27, 28], bubble-bubble interaction [18], and multibubble sonoluminescence
[29], and hence an accurate understanding of it is crucial. In fact, by carefully examining
the oscillation phases of two coupled bubbles for weak driving, we have recently succeeded
in presenting a novel interpretation, which may be more accurate than previous ones, of
the sign reversal of the secondary Bjerknes force [18, 19], a paradoxical phenomenon that
is considered to be the cause of stable structure formation of bubbles in a weak acoustic
ﬁeld [24, 30]. In that discussion, it was suggested that the transition frequencies seem to be
essential components for gaining an accurate understanding of the phenomenon, since the

5

sign reversal takes place at the transition frequencies that cannot be obtained by resonance-
frequency analysis.
In the present paper, we show by examining the oscillation phases
that the bubbles exchange their oscillation states through the avoided crossing. As shown
later, the point at which the state exchange occurs can be clearly detected by observing the
transition frequencies.

Figure 5 shows the transition frequencies for (R10, R20, R30) = (50 µm, 51 µm, 51.5 µm)
with l23 = 20. The thick lines denote the transition frequencies that correspond to the
resonance frequencies already shown in Fig. 2(c). As expected from the mathematical proof
presented in [17], the bubbles have up to ﬁve transition frequencies, all of which invert
the oscillation phase of the corresponding bubble. It is worth noting that in each panel of
Fig. 5 the second-highest resonance frequency (denoted below by ω2nd) crosses once with
a transition frequency in the avoided crossing region. Such crossings have not been found
in double-bubble systems [16, 18]. In the following discussion, we focus our attention on
the phase properties of the bubbles in this region to elucidate what happens around the
intersecting points.

The phase delays φi for diﬀerent l12 as functions of ω/ω10 are shown by the solid lines in
Fig. 6. In the computation of φi, we used very small but nonzero δi to obtain continuous
results. Figures 6(a)-6(b) and 6(c)-6(d), respectively, show φi for l12 smaller and larger
than the intersecting point l12 = lint (≈8.89). Here, we only displayed φi in the frequency
range around the two avoided crossing resonance frequencies. The vertical dotted lines
indicate the two lowest resonance frequencies. As in double-bubble cases [18, 19], at the
resonance frequencies the phase delays of all bubbles shift simultaneously by +π, whereas
at the remaining transition frequencies only one phase delay shifts by −π.

The φi-curves, as can be clearly seen in the ﬁgures, have diﬀerent convexities on diﬀerent
sides of the intersecting point. For l12 smaller than lint, at ω2nd, φ1 and φ2 shift from π to
2π but φ3 shifts from 0 to π as ω increases. For l12 larger than lint, on the other hand, an
opposite tendency is seen; φ1 and φ2 shift from 0 to π but φ3 shifts from π to 2π. That
is, a kind of state exchange takes place between bubble 3 and the other two bubbles at the
intersecting point.

Regarding the relationship between the state exchange and the phase properties, in the
frequency range around ω2nd, bubble 3 oscillates out-of-phase with the other bubbles re-
gardless of whether l12 < lint or l12 > lint, although the individual phase delays experience
rapid shifts at ω2nd. This means that the state exchange cannot be perceived accurately
by observing whether the bubbles oscillate in-phase or out-of-phase with each other or by
observing the sign of the secondary Bjerknes force, which is determined by the cosine of the
phase diﬀerence between two bubbles [31, 32]. Just the individual phase delays (or transition
frequencies) should be examined.

In the φi-curves, we can ﬁnd several similarities with double-bubble cases. Bubbles 1 and
2, or bubble 3, have a phase delay greater than π in the frequency range from ω2nd to a
certain higher frequency (equal to the next-higher transition frequency of the corresponding
bubble). A similar observation can be found for double-bubble systems [18, 19]. In Ref. [18]
we discovered and elucidated that such a large phase delay can appear when two bubbles
interact with each other through sound. In the double-bubble case, the larger one of the two
bubbles has a phase delay greater than π in the frequency range between the higher of two
resonance frequencies and the highest of the transition frequencies of the bubble. We can,
for a wider frequency range, also ﬁnd a similarity between the double- and triple-bubble
cases. In the frequency range ω/ω10 < 0.995, the proﬁles of φ1 and φ2 for l12 < lint and that

6

of φ3 for l12 > lint are very similar to the proﬁle of the phase delay of the larger bubble in
a double-bubble system; those phase delays ﬁrst exhibit two sharp rises and then one sharp
fall as ω increases. Also, the proﬁles of the remaining phase delays are very similar to that
of the phase delay of the smaller bubble in a double-bubble system, exhibiting one sharp
rise, one sharp fall, and then one sharp rise. This seems to indicate that in the frequency
range considered, for l12 < lint bubbles 1 and 2 act as “larger bubbles” while bubble 3 acts
as a “smaller bubble,” but for l12 > lint each bubble acts in the opposite way; that is,
the physical roles that the bubbles play are exchanged through the avoided crossing. This
observation could also be interpreted as a result of the change of a physical meaning of ω2nd.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, ω2nd is a hybrid of two resonance frequencies having diﬀerent origins.
We assume here that the origin, or the principal origin, of each avoided crossing resonance
frequency is switched at lint. This assumption allows us to consider that ω2nd for l12 < lint,
for example, is the resonance frequency whose principal origin is bubble 3. This suggestion
is consistent, not only with the observation for large l23 where the origin of each resonance
frequency is relatively clear, but also with the above speculation that bubbles 3 acts as a
“smaller bubble” for l12 < lint, because ω2nd is higher than the lowest resonance frequency
that is one of the two avoided crossing resonance frequencies. The observation for l12 > lint
can be interpreted in a similar manner.

Lastly, we brieﬂy examine how the damping aﬀects the state exchange. For the damping

coeﬃcient, we use the value for viscous damping,

δi =

4µ
ρR2
i0

(13)

with the viscosity µ = 1.002 × 10−3 kg/(m s). The dashed curves in Fig. 6 show the phase
delays in the damped case. The viscous eﬀect smoothes the phase proﬁles, but the convexity
of the curves is not altered from that for δi ≈ 0, as in the double-bubble cases [18, 19]. The
state exchange is clearly detected even in the present case. The qualitative tendencies of the
phase delays are not changed by the viscous damping.

V. CONCLUSION

We have shown theoretically that avoided crossings can be observed in the resonance
frequencies of acoustically coupled gas bubbles plotted as functions of the separation dis-
tances. A state exchange taking place between the bubbles in the avoided crossing region
has been clearly exhibited by examining the oscillation phases and transition frequencies of
the coupled bubbles. We have clariﬁed that the state exchange is perceived by observing the
individual oscillation phases of the bubbles, not by observing whether the bubbles oscillate
in-phase or out-of-phase with each other. Since the individual phase (or more properly, the
phase diﬀerence between a bubble and the external sound) determines the sign of the primar-
ily Bjerknes force [26, 27, 28] acting on the corresponding bubble, this state exchange should
play a role in, e.g., acoustic levitation using the force. The results of this study suggest that
the transition frequencies introduced in Ref. [16] can be a useful tool for detecting the state
exchange, which takes place at the separation distance where an avoided crossing resonance
frequency crosses with a transition frequency that is not a resonance frequency. Though we
only considered triple-bubble systems in a linear arrangement, extensions to systems con-
taining a larger number of bubbles and in diﬀerent arrangements may be straightforward.

7

As with other physical systems, the avoided crossings in acoustically coupled bubbles might
be real.

though Doinikov also derived a model for bubbles in a compressible liquid. Equations
(A1) and (A2) represent the volume oscillation of bubble i and its translational motion,
respectively. The linear coupled oscillator model used in the present study is recovered from
Eq. (A1) by truncating the high-order terms Hi j and assuming weak driving and γ = κi.

Since the velocity ﬁeld forming around a pulsating sphere is proportional to 1/r2, where
r is the distance measured from the center of the sphere, the truncated terms Hi j, which are
composed of the translational velocities ˙pi, might be considered to be of fourth, or higher,
order with respect to the inverse of the separation distances. This speculation is consistent
with the suggestion by Harkin et al. for double-bubble systems [20].

Equation (A1) further suggests that under the assumption of ˙pi ≈ 0 one cannot construct
a linear model that has higher-order accuracy than that of Eq. (1), since this assumption
makes the high-order terms inaccurate.

[25] For such a large separation distance, in practice the time delay eﬀect due to the ﬁnite sound
speed of the surrounding liquid should be taken into account, though we only present an
idealized result for the sake of simplicity.

FIG. 6: Phase delays φi (rad) normalized by π as functions of ω/ω10 for diﬀerent l12 [(a), (b): for
l12 < lint, (c), (d): for l12 > lint]. The solid and the dashed curves denote φi for negligible and non-
negligible damping, respectively, and the vertical dotted lines indicate the two lowest resonance
frequencies (the higher is thus the second-highest resonance frequency ω2nd).

Hydrodynamic theory of de-wetting

Jens Eggers

A prototypical problem in the study of wetting phenomena is that of a solid plunging into or being
withdrawn from a liquid bath. In the latter, de-wetting case, a critical speed exists above which
a stationary contact line is no longer sustainable and a liquid ﬁlm is being deposited on the solid.
Demonstrating this behavior to be a hydrodynamic instability close to the contact line, we provide
the ﬁrst theoretical explanation of a classical prediction due to Derjaguin and Levi:
instability
occurs when the outer, static meniscus approaches the shape corresponding to a perfectly wetting
ﬂuid.

The forced wetting or de-wetting of a solid is an impor-
tant feature of many environmental and industrial ﬂows.
In typical applications such as painting, coating, or oil
recovery it is crucial to know whether the solid will be
covered by a macroscopic ﬁlm or not. If a ﬁber is plung-
ing into a liquid bath to be coated (wetting case), the
speed can be quite high (m/sec) [1], while maintaining
a stationary contact line. In the opposite case of with-
drawal (de-wetting), a stationary contact line is observed
only for very low speeds, and a macroscopic ﬁlm is de-
posited [2, 3] typically at a speed of only a few cm/sec.
Yet no theoretical explanation for this instability exists,
or of the fundamental diﬀerence between the two cases.

It is well known [4, 5] that viscous forces become very
large near a moving contact line, and are controlled only
by some microscopic cut-oﬀ λ, for example a slip length
[4, 6]. As a result of the interplay between viscous and
surface tension forces, the interface is highly curved, and
the contact line speed U is properly measured by the
capillary number Ca = U η/γ, where η is the viscosity of
the ﬂuid and γ the surface tension between ﬂuid and gas.
Owing to this bending the interface angle measured at,
say, 100µm away from the contact line diﬀers [7, 8, 9, 10]
signiﬁcantly from the microscopic angle directly at the
contact line.

It was ﬁrst proposed by Derjaguin and Levi [11], and
later reiterated by others [12], that instability occurs if
this dynamic interface angle reaches zero. Apart from
the fact that there is no justiﬁcation for this condition,
it does not lead to a unique criterion since the angle de-
pends on the position where it is evaluated. However, it
was noted experimentally [2] that the interface proﬁle at
the critical speed corresponds to a static meniscus with
zero equilibrium contact angle, except in the immediate
neighborhood of the contact line. Another important set
of experimental observations [13] was performed with ﬂu-
ids of diﬀerent viscosities and equilibrium contact angles
θe in a capillary tube:
it was found that instability oc-
curred if Ca/θ3
e exceeds a critical value, strongly pointing
to a hydrodynamic mechanism for the instability.

To explain the physical mechanism behind the insta-
bility, we note that the interface shape h(x) near the

contact line must have the form

h(x) = 3λH(ξ),

ξ = xθe/(3λ),

(1)

since the cut-oﬀ λ is the only available length scale. The
dependence on θe was put in for later convenience. As
e /(3λ)H ′′(0) becomes
expected, the curvature h′′(0) = θ2
very large at the contact line, since λ is in the order of
nanometers. As the curvature of the local solution has to
match to a value of order unity in the static outer part of
the proﬁle, the usual boundary condition for H is one of
vanishing curvature for large ξ. In the wetting case this
leads to an asymptotic solution ﬁrst found by Voinov [14]
and an expression for the interface angle usually referred
to as “Tanner’s law” [7].

However, it is a well-known but little appreciated fact
[15] that Voinov’s solution fails away from the contact
line in the de-wetting situation.
Instead, the local so-
lution always retains a positive curvature, and will fail
to match to an outer solution in the limit of small λ.
At the critical speed, the necessary compromise between
the inner solution near the contact line and the outer
from all
static solution has been pushed to the limit:
possible inner solutions, the one with the smallest pos-
sible curvature is selected. The outer solution, on the
other hand, realizes the solution with the largest curva-
ture, which happens to be the one corresponding to zero
contact angle, in agreement with the criterion of Der-
jaguin and Levi. Note that this mechanism diﬀers from
the one proposed by de Gennes [16], which is based en-
tirely on properties of the local solution near the contact
line. In a companion paper [17] we show that de Gennes’
local solution is inconsistent with a class of contact line
models, such as the slip model considered here.

To lay down the theory behind the above argument,
we choose a plate being withdrawn from a liquid bath
(see Fig.1) as a test case, a geometry which was stud-
ied in detail in [18]. There it was found numerically
that there exists a critical capillary number Cacr, above
which no static solution exists, in agreement with the ex-
perimental ﬁndings described above. If both θ and the
equilibrium contact angle θe are small, one can treat the
problem in the framework of lubrication theory, assum-

ing a parabolic ﬂow proﬁle. This greatly simpliﬁes the
problem, but without altering its essential structure.

To relieve the corner singularity at the moving contact
line, we allow the ﬂuid to slide across the solid surface,
following the Navier slip law [6]

The left hand side of (3) corresponds to viscous forces,
diverging as the contact line position h(0) = 0 is ap-
proached, but weakened by the presence of slip. Close
to the contact line, viscous forces are balanced by sur-
face tension forces (ﬁrst term on the right), resulting in a
highly curved interface near the contact line. The other
two terms stem from gravity and only come into play
at greater distances. We also assume that the angle at
the contact line h′(0) = θe is constant, which then has
to be the equilibrium contact angle, in order to give the
right result at vanishing speed. Note that we have used
the simplest possible contact line model, and no special
signiﬁcance should be attached to our choice. Since the
instability mechanism is hydrodynamic, any local contact
line model can be incorporated into our description. Far
away from the interface the surface coincides with the liq-
uid bath, so the third boundary condition is h′(∞) = θ.
To disentangle the local contact line behavior from the
far-ﬁeld meniscus, we transform equation (3) into simi-
larity variables (1):

δ

+ µ2(θ/θe − H

)

with boundary conditions H(0) = 0, H ′(0) = 1, and
H ′(∞) = θ/θe. The three parameters remaining in the
problem are the rescaled capillary number δ = 3Ca/θ3
e,
the rescaled cut-oﬀ µ = λ/θe, and the relative inclination
angle θ/θe.

Since we are interested in the limit of µ being very
small, we will ﬁrst look at the equation for µ = 0, as ap-
propriate close to the contact line. As mentioned above,
in the limit of large ξ this equation behaves very diﬀer-
ently, depending on whether δ > 0 or δ < 0. This can
be understood from the simpliﬁed equation H ′′′ = δ/H 2,
which can be integrated completely [15, 19]. Namely, if
δ < 0 (wetting), there exists an asymptotic solution for
ξ → ∞ [14], whose curvature vanishes at inﬁnity.

If on the other hand δ > 0 (de-wetting), all solutions
have a ﬁnite curvature at inﬁnity. Solutions which obey
our boundary condition H(0) = 0 can be written [15]
parametrically as

where Ai and Bi are Airy functions. The limit ξ →

αAi(s1) + βBi(s1) = 0.

Since the solution extends to s = ∞, s1 has to be the
largest root of (7).

The constant β can be determined by matching (5) to
the cutoﬀ region near the contact line, where one ﬁnds
H ′(ξ) ≈
in the limit of small ξ
[15]. Comparing this to the ﬁrst order expansion of the
(cid:3)

we ﬁnd β2 = π exp(1/(3δ))/22/3 + O(δ). The matching
described here was investigated in greater detail for the
case δ < 0 in [17]. We found that higher order corrections
in δ were surprisingly weak, and depended only very little
on the type of cut-oﬀ used at the contact line. Thus we
are conﬁdent that the same holds true in the present case.
At the critical capillary number Cacr the only remain-
ing parameter, which is α, can be determined from the
condition that κ∞ should be minimal, in other words
Ai(s1) must be maximal among solutions of (7). By
choosing α = αcr ≡ −βBi(smax)/Ai(smax) we can in fact
ensure that Ai assumes its global maximum 0.53566 . . .,
which occurs for s = smax = −1.0188 . . .. In summary,

we ﬁnd then for the critical solution that minimizes the
curvature

(9)

which is now given exclusively in terms of the rescaled
capillary number δ.

The solution (5) has to be matched to an outer solu-
tion of (3), valid away from the contact line. In the spirit
of the classical technique [6] employed for the spreading
drops, this is a static solution of (3), but with an appar-
ent contact angle diﬀerent from H ′(0) = 1. The general
solution of (4) with δ = 0 gives

H

(ξ) = θ/θe − θ0 e

−µξ,

(10)

so the curvature at the plate is H ′′(0) = µθ0. The largest
curvature for which (10) still makes sense is µθ/θe, at
which point the apparent contact angle has reached zero.
The two solutions have to be matched together, such
that the curvature of (5) for large arguments agrees with
that of (10) for small arguments. At large capillary num-
ber this will no longer be possible, since κcr
∞ becomes
larger than µθ/θe. At the critical capillary number Cacr,
(9) thus has to be equated with µθ/θe, giving

cr exp[−1/(3δcr)] = 21/3π(Ai(smax))2µθ/θe
δ1/3

(11)

for the critical rescaled capillary number δcr = 3Cacr/θ3
e.
This equation completely determines the stability bound-
ary found numerically in [18], as function of all parame-
ters. It also implies that for a given geometry, instability
occurs if the parameter δcr = 3Ca/θ3
e exceeds a criti-
cal value (up to very small logarithmic corrections), in
agreement with experiment [13].

For our procedure to be consistent, though, we need
to make sure that the two solutions (5) and (10) have
suﬃcient overlap to be matched. The inner and outer
solutions at Cacr are, in summary,

H

H

′cr
inner = δ1/3f (ξβ2)
′cr
outer = (θ/θe)(1 − e

−µξ),

where f is a universal function given by (5) with α = αcr.
Thus if β2 ≫ µ the large-ξ limit of H ′cr
inner overlaps with
the small-ξ limit of H ′cr
outer, which translates into θ/θe ≫
δ1/3.

In Fig. 2 we show the result of a numerical integration
of (4) for θ/θcr = 10 at the critical capillary number. The
interface slope follows the static solution perfectly almost
up to the contact line, where it has to turn over, while
the static solution extrapolates to zero. Coming from
the interior, (5) describes the solution equally well up
to the turning point. Note that there are no adjustable
parameters in Fig. 2, we simply took the inner and outer
solutions in the critical case. In fact, even for θ/θcr =
1, when there is not yet much overlap between the two

H ′(0) = 0 for the outer solution, consistent with the condition
by Derjaguin and Levi. The parameters are µ = 10−4 and
θ/θe = 10, and thus δcr = 0.0572 from (11).

solutions, equation (11) already works extremely well in
describing the loss of the stationary solution, as shown
in Fig. 3. Again, no parameter was adjusted to achieve
this comparison.

Beyond the wet-dry transition studied here, in [18] two
more states have been described, characterized by thin
and thick wetting ﬁlms, respectively. The stability of
these solutions, and possible hysteresis phenomena re-

our approach is not limited to the moving plate geome-
try studied here, nor is it restricted to a speciﬁc contact
line model, since it is based entirely on hydrodynamic
arguments away from the contact line. For example, if
van-der-Waals forces are dominant near the contact line
[20], the parameter µ in (11) simply needs to be replaced
e), where A is the Hamaker
by µvdw =
constant.

A/(6πγ)/(2θ2

To generalize to a diﬀerent geometry, one has to replace
(10) by the appropriate static solution for the problem
at hand. This is done almost trivially for the case of a
vertical wall [21], and easily extended [18] to the ﬂow in
a narrow capillary, to be able to compare directly to ex-
periments [13]. Hocking [18] found that the present slip
theory correctly predicts Cacr/θ3
e to be a constant, but
overestimates this constant by a factor of two, if reason-
able values for the slip length λ are assumed. Reasons
for this discrepancy could be both the considerable con-
tact angle hysteresis in the experiment [13], and failure
of the simple contact line model used in our calculation.

A new set of experiments, using the plate geometry, is
being planned to clear up these questions [22].

Another important generalization is to higher dimen-
sional problems, in which the contact line does not re-
main straight. An instability toward inclined contact
lines was observed in [12], as well as in recent experi-
ments with drops running down an inclined plane [23].
To explain the characteristic inclination angle of such a
contact line, one needs to identify a characteristic speed
of de-wetting [12, 24], which our present approach eﬀec-
tively provides.

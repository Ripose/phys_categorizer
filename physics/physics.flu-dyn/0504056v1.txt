Faraday surface instability measurements of the critical acceleration, ac, and wavenumber, kc,
for standing surface waves on a tetracosanol (C24H50) melt exhibit abrupt changes at Ts = 54
C,
∼4
C above the bulk freezing temperature. The measured variations of ac and kc vs. temperature
and driving frequency are accounted for quantitatively by a hydrodynamic model, revealing a change
from a free-slip surface ﬂow, generic for a free liquid surface (T > Ts), to a surface-pinned, no-slip
ﬂow, characteristic of a ﬂow near a wetted solid wall (T < Ts). The change at Ts is traced to the
onset of surface freezing, where the steep velocity gradient in the surface-pinned ﬂow signiﬁcantly
increases the viscous dissipation near the surface.

Spatial conﬁnement of a liquid often changes its prop-
erties markedly. For example, superheating above the
equilibrium melting temperature [1] and order quench-
ing upon freezing [2] were observed under conﬁnement
only.
In particular, ﬂow under conﬁnement is impor-
tant for processes ranging from tribology to protein fold-
ing to transport through ion channels in cell membranes
[3]. A transition from a liquid-like to a granular-solid-like
shear response was observed at nano-scale conﬁnements
[4]. The surface freezing (SF) eﬀect [5], where a solid
monolayer forms at the surface of a pure normal-alkane
(CnH2n+2) melt, provides a unique system for studying
semi-conﬁned ﬂow at a solid-liquid interface. The abrupt
onset of SF at Ts allows one to switch on (and oﬀ) the
solid phase by a small temperature variation. Under-
standing such interfaces would also elucidate the role of
ﬂow in nucleation and growth processes of crystals from
melts, which are dominated by such interfaces [6].

SF occurs in melts of several chain molecules (alkenes,
alcohols, semi-ﬂuorinated alkanes, diols, CiEj) [7], and at
both liquid/liquid [8] and liquid/solid [9] interfaces. Re-
lated surface ordering eﬀects were observed in melts of
polymers comprising alkyl chains in the backbone or as
side chains [10], in liquid alloys [11], and in several liquid
crystals [12]. While the structural and thermodynamic
aspects of SF have been studied in great detail [13], the
inﬂuence of surface ordering on macroscopic near-surface
ﬂows has received little attention to date in this sizable,
technologically-important class of materials.

To study this issue, we employ the Faraday instabil-
ity, which forms standing wave patterns (SWP) at the
free surface of a vertically-vibrated liquid [14]. By virtue
of its simplicity, this instability is outstanding among
pattern-forming systems and a detailed theoretical de-
scription has been achieved. The SWP formed depend
sensitively on, and allow a detailed study of, the changes

in the surface hydrodynamics upon SF. As this study
of SF demonstrates, the instability can therefore be em-
ployed to explore physical processes which are diﬃcult to
access by other, classical means. It also exempliﬁes the
more general class of parametric instabilities, which are
of interest in a broad range of areas including granular
media, plasmas, nonlinear optics, reaction-diﬀusion sys-
tems, and condensed-matter physics [15].

The sample used is n-tetracosane, C24H50. With Ts =
54 ◦C and a bulk freezing temperature Tb = 50 ◦C, it
exhibits the largest temperature range of SF of all pure
n-alkanes [5]. Our circular, 18-cm diameter, sample cell
was ﬁlled with 300 g of C24H50 (Aldrich, 99.9% pure) to
a height of h = 1.5 cm above the cell bottom. The cell
is immersed in a thermostatted water bath yielding good
temperature stability (±0.05 ◦C) and minimizing tem-
perature gradients between the surface and bulk. The
bath is vibrated sinusoidally in the vertical direction at a
driving frequency f by an electromechanical shaker. The
SWP are tracked and recorded using a CCD camera and
stroboscopic illumination [16].

Two characteristic quantities were measured: the crit-
ical acceleration, ac, required for destabilizing the ﬂat
surface to form the SWP, and the critical wavenumber,
kc, which deﬁnes the spatial periodicity of the SWP at
the onset of the instability. Square SWP (inset of Fig.
1(a)) were found for all T and f investigated. Fourier
transforms were used to determine kc from each pattern.
The T -dependence of kc and ac at ﬁxed f = 150 Hz is
shown in Fig. 1. Upon cooling from 58 ◦C to 54 ◦C, kc
remains roughly constant. At 54 ◦C, however, a ∼60 m−1
jump is observed in kc. Below T = 54 ◦C, kc increases
linearly with decreasing T . No cooling/heating hysteresis
is observed. Similar behavior is seen for ac: it is roughly
constant for 54◦C < T < 58◦C, at 54 ◦C it jumps by
∼20%, and it is roughly constant for T < 54 ◦C. As the

◦

discontinuities in both quantities occur right at the onset
temperature Ts = 54 ◦C reported for SF in C24H50, it is
reasonable to assign these macroscopic eﬀects to the on-
set of SF, a conclusion supported by the analysis below.
The measured ﬁxed-T f -dependence of kc and ac,
shown in Fig. 2, is monotonically increasing, as is typ-
ical for viscous Newtonian liquids [17], both above and
below Ts. Both quantities are larger for the SF phase
than for the liquid surface phase over the full f -range in-
vestigated, in agreement with the ﬁxed-f , T -dependent
measurements shown in Fig. 1.

To account for these observations, we turn to surface
hydrodynamics. The validity of the dispersion relation of
surface waves on inviscid liquids for accurately predict-
ing the Faraday instability dispersion relation (kc vs. f )
of the SWP has been experimentally demonstrated [18]
for liquids of viscosities η & 100ηwater. Thus, it should
≈ 4ηwater. For
also hold for liquid C24H50, where ηC24H50

a liquid layer of depth h and inﬁnite horizontal extent,
this dispersion relation is ω2 = (gkc + γ/ρk3
c ) tanh(kch),
where g = 9.81 ms−2, γ, ρ, and ω are the acceleration of
gravity, surface tension, density, and angular frequency
of the wave, respectively [19]. The observed SWP in all
our experiments exhibit ω = 2πf /2, conforming to the
common subharmonic response of the Faraday instability
[17]. Since tanh (kch) ≈ 1 in all our experiments, a sim-
ple linear dependence of ω2 − gkc on k3
c is expected, the
slope of which is γ/ρ. This relation is indeed found both
above and below Ts (Fig. 2(c)), indicating that in both
the frozen and the non-frozen surface phases the simple
dispersion relation is obeyed. The larger slope found at
T = 58 ◦C as compared to that at T = 52 ◦C indicates
that γ(T = 58 ◦C) > γ(T = 52 ◦C), since ρ does not
change upon SF. This is consistent with the standard
static surface tension curve γs(T ), measured using the
Wilhelmy plate method, and shown as a solid line in Fig.
3. The onset of SF at Ts = 54 ◦C is clearly manifested

in this curve by the abrupt change in the slope from a
negative to a positive value, due to the drop in the sur-
face entropy upon SF [5]. Comparing this curve with
the dynamic surface tension γd(T ), extracted from our
measurements using the dispersion relation above (Fig.
3, triangles), reveals a reasonable agreement for the non-
frozen surface phase (T > Ts). In the SF phase (T < Ts),
however, a ∼ 3 mN/m shift of γd(T ) below γs(T ) is ob-
served, although the linear T -dependence and the slope
remain the same.

To account for this downshift, we recall that the pres-
ence of a surfactant monolayer on a liquid surface has
been demonstrated to change the dispersion relation of
surface waves and to increase the damping [20]. We
have therefore employed a model recently introduced by
Kumar and Matar for the Faraday instability in a liq-
uid covered by an insoluble surfactant layer (KM-model)
[21]. Without an overlayer, the shear stress at the liq-
uid surface vanishes, yielding a free-slip boundary con-
dition for liquid ﬂow. For the surfactant- or SF-layer-
covered surface, the shear stress is ﬁnite, and in the limit
of large Marangoni number (ratio of surface-tension-
gradient forces to viscous forces) yields a pinned, no-slip
boundary condition. We use the KM-model with the for-
mer boundary condition for T > Ts, and with the latter
boundary condition for T < Ts. Given the crystalline,
solid structure of the surface-frozen monolayer, such an
assumption appears justiﬁed. Using the measured static
surface tension γs(T ), the dynamic viscosity η(T ) [22],
and the aforementioned change in the boundary condi-
tion at Ts, the KM-model yields for ﬁxed f = 150 Hz the
lines shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). The good agreement
with the measured values is evident. In particular, the
change of the hydrodynamic boundary condition at Ts
results not only in a jump of ∼20% in ac, but also in a
similar jump of ∼3% in kc, both in good agreement with
the experimental observation. Moreover, the frequency
dependent calculations, shown as lines in Fig. 2, demon-
strate that the KM-model accounts accurately also for
the observed frequency dependence of kc and ac over the
full dynamic range investigated, and for the abrupt in-
crease in these quantities upon SF.

The increase in ac upon SF reﬂects an increase in the
damping of the surface excitations, assignable, in turn,
to the large velocity gradient near the surface imposed
by the pinning of the ﬂow at the surface. The increased
damping leads to a viscous detuning of the inviscid dis-
persion relation, and thus to a jump in the spatial pe-
riodicity of the waves. It is interesting to note that the
change in the boundary condition is equivalent to an in-
ﬁnite surface elasticity: the surface in our model can still
deform in the vertical direction, but the deformations are
such that the surface neither contracts nor expands.

One of the seminal papers on SF in n-alkanes reports
light-scattering measurements on thermally-excited cap-
illary waves above and below Ts [23]. The surface elon-

gations due to capillary waves are microscopic, typically
of the order of nanometers [24]. However, they are still
governed by the same dispersion relation as the macro-
scopic, mm-scale surface waves of the Faraday instability
[25]. It therefore seems puzzling that for capillary waves
a decreased damping was observed upon SF, rather than
the increased damping found here. We believe the dif-
ferent behavior arises due to the diﬀerent magnitudes
of the surface elongations in the two cases, and conse-
quently the diﬀerent nature of the excited motion. The
Faraday instability excites macroscopic waves which pro-
duce real hydrodynamic ﬂow in the proximity of the
surface. Thus, the no-slip boundary condition in the
surface-frozen phase induces an increased velocity gradi-
ent, and consequently viscous dissipation across macro-
scopic surface-normal distances ensues. In contrast, for
the nanometer-sized amplitudes of the thermally-excited
capillary waves, almost no macroscopic hydrodynamic
ﬂow occurs. The postulated conformational changes in
the molecular shape at Ts, from a ﬂexible, end-distorted
shape to a rigid extended one [26], may even enhance the
molecular mobility, particularly along their long, surface-
normal, axis. This, in turn, should reduce the damp-
ing for these microscopic excitations.
Indeed, the in-
crease in surface-normal molecular mobility, which in-
creases the surface entropy [27], and the molecular con-
formation changes, which reduce the internal energy [26],
are among the strongest candidates proposed for explain-
ing the occurrence of the SF eﬀect.

The SF-induced changes in the boundary condition,
demonstrated here to alter signiﬁcantly the macroscopic
ﬂow characteristics near the surface for one particular
alkane, should be of importance for all materials exhibit-
ing surface or interfacial freezing, particularly when the
ﬂow geometry involves large surface areas. One example

is microﬂuidic devices [28]. Another example is foams,
where the thinning and bursting rates of the bubbles are
determined by the viscous drainage ﬂow within the liq-
uid ﬁlms constituting the bubble walls [29]. Thus, the
present results explain also the hydrodynamics underly-
ing the increased lifetime of alkane bubbles, reported as a
macroscopic manifestation of SF [30]. The increase in the
eﬀective viscous drag on the drainage ﬂow, caused by the
no-slip boundary condition in the SF phase, reduces the
drainage rate, and consequently the wall-thinning and
bursting rates of the bubbles. This leads to the observed
increase in the bubbles’ lifetime upon the onset of SF.

It has recently been shown that the Faraday instability
can be employed to explore rheological behavior of bulk
liquids [31], especially when it is diﬃcult to use other
techniques (e.g., near a liquid-vapor critical point [32]).
We demonstrated here that this method allows visual-
izing and examining on a macroscopic scale rheological
aspects of microscopic structured surfaces, in particu-
lar the interesting case of a change of the shear-stress
boundary condition at a liquid’s surface from the generic,
free-slip one to a no-slip one, characteristic of a wetted
solid wall [33]. We hope that this study will stimulate
further experiments focusing on how the surface hydro-
dynamics is aﬀected by microscopic modiﬁcations of the
structure of surfaces or interfaces, e.g., experiments on
wetting transitions which have been proven to allow for a
precise control of liquid surface microstructure as a func-
tion of temperature [34]. This method could also ex-
tend the wavelength and frequency ranges of established
semi-microscopic and microscopic techniques like light
scattering [25] and surface x-ray photon correlation spec-
troscopy [35] towards macroscopic hydrodynamic length
scales. More generally, the present method could be ap-
plied to other parametric instabilities to provide deeper
insight into those areas of science where such instabilities
occur [15].

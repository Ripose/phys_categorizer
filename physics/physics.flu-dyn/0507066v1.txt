Turbulent Friction in Rough Pipes and the Energy
Spectrum of the Phenomenological Theory

The classical experiments on turbulent friction in rough pipes were performed by J. Nikuradse in
the 1930’s. Seventy years later, they continue to defy theory. Here we model Nikuradse’s experiments
using the phenomenological theory of Kolmog´orov, a theory that is widely thought to be applicable
only to highly idealized ﬂows. Our results include both the empirical scalings of Blasius and Strickler,
and are otherwise in minute qualitative agreement with the experiments; they suggest that the
phenomenological theory may be relevant to other ﬂows of practical interest; and they unveil the
existence of close ties between two milestones of experimental and theoretical turbulence.

Turbulence is the unrest that spontaneously takes over
a streamline ﬂow adjacent to a wall or obstacle when
the ﬂow is made suﬃciently fast. Although most of the
ﬂows that surround us in everyday life and in nature
are turbulent ﬂows over rough walls, these ﬂows have
remained amongst the least understood phenomena of
classical physics [1, 2]. Thus, one of the weightier ex-
perimental studies of turbulent ﬂows on rough walls, and
the most useful in common applications, is yet to be ex-
plained theoretically 70 years after its publication.
In
that study [3], Nikuradse elucidated how the friction co-
eﬃcient between the wall of a pipe and the turbulent
ﬂow inside depends on the Reynolds number of the ﬂow
and the roughness of the wall. The friction coeﬃcient,
f , is a measure of the shear stress (or shear force per
unit area) that the turbulent ﬂow exerts on the wall of
a pipe; it is customarily expressed in dimensionless form
as f = τ /ρV 2, where ρ is the density of the liquid that
ﬂows in the pipe and V the mean velocity of the ﬂow.
The Reynolds number is deﬁned as Re = V R/ν, where
R is the radius of the pipe and ν the kinematic viscosity
of the liquid. Last, the roughness is deﬁned as the ratio
r/R between the size r of the roughness elements (sand
grains in the case of Nikuradse’s experiments) that line
the wall of the pipe and the radius of the pipe.

Nikuradse presented his data in the form of six curves,
the log-log plots of f versus Re for six values of the rough-
ness [3]. These curves are shown in Fig. 1. At the onset
of turbulence [4], at a Re of about 3,000, all six curves
rise united in a single bundle. At a Re of about 3,500,
the bundle bends downward to form a marked hump and
then it plunges in accord with Blasius’s empirical scal-
ing [5], f ∼ Re
, as one by one in order of decreas-
ing roughness the curves start to careen away from the
bundle. After leaving the bundle, which continues to
plunge, each curve sets out to trace a belly [6] as it steers
farther from the bundle with increasing Re, then ﬂexes
towards a terminal, constant value of f that is in keep-
ing with Strickler’s empirical scaling [7], f ∼ (r/R)1/3.
For seventy years now, our understanding of these curves
has been aided by little beyond a pictorial narrative of

In our theoretical work, we adopt the phenomeno-
logical imagery of “turbulent eddies” [9, 10, 11] and
use the spectrum of turbulent energy [12] at a length-
scale σ, E(σ), to determine the velocity of the eddies

E(σ) = Cε2/3σ5/3cd(η/σ)ce(σ/R). Here C is a dimen-

η = ν3/4ε−1/4 the viscous lengthscale, R the largest
lengthscale in the ﬂow, Cε2/3σ5/3 the Kolmog´orov spec-
trum (which is valid in the inertial range, η ≪ σ ≪ R),
and cd and ce are dimensionless corrections for the dis-
sipation range and the energy range, respectively. For
cd we adopt an exponential form, cd(η/σ) = exp(−βη/σ)
(which gives cd ≈ 1 except in the dissipation range, where
σ ≈ η), and for ce the form proposed by von K´arm´an,
ce(σ/R) = (1 + γ(σ/R)2)−17/6 (which gives ce ≈ 1 ex-
cept in the energy range, where σ ≈ R), where β and
γ are dimensionless constants [12]. Thus, for s in the

We now seek to derive an expression for τ , the shear
R
stress on the wall of the pipe. We assume a viscous layer
of constant thickness aη, where a is a dimensionless con-
stant, and call W a wetted surface parallel to the peaks
of the viscous layer (Fig. 2). Then, τ is eﬀected by mo-
mentum transfer across W . Above W , the velocity of the
ﬂow scales with V , and the ﬂuid carries a high horizon-
tal momentum per unit volume (∼ ρV ). Below W , the
velocity of the ﬂow is negligible, and the ﬂuid carries a
negligible horizontal momentum per unit volume. Now
consider an eddy that straddles the wetted surface W .
This eddy transfers ﬂuid of high horizontal momentum
downwards across W , and ﬂuid of negligible horizontal
momentum upwards across W . The net rate of transfer
of momentum across W is set by the velocity normal to
W , which velocity is provided by the eddy. Therefore,
if vn denotes the velocity normal to W provided by the
dominant eddy that straddles W , then the shear stress
eﬀected by momentum transfer across W scales in the
form τ ∼ ρ V vn.

In order to identify the dominant eddy that straddles
W , let us denote by s = r + aη the size of the largest
eddy that ﬁts the coves between successive roughness el-
ements. Eddies much larger than s can provide only a
negligible velocity normal to W .
(This observation is
purely a matter of geometry.) On the other hand, eddies
smaller than s can provide a sizable velocity normal to
W . Nevertheless, if these eddies are much smaller than
s, their velocities are overshadowed by the velocity of the
eddy of size s. Thus, vn scales with us, which is the ve-
locity of the eddy of size s, and the dominant eddy is
the largest eddy that ﬁts the coves between successive
roughness elements. We conclude that τ ∼ ρ V us, and
therefore f ∼ us/V . To express f as a function of Re and
r/D, we use ε ∼ V 3/R to write η = bR Re
, where b
is a dimensionless constant. Then,

To evaluate computationally the integral of (1), we
set β = 2.1, γ = 6.783 (the values given in [12]), and
a = 5 (5η being a common estimation of the thickness
of the viscous layer), and treat b and K as free parame-
ters. With b = 15 and K = 0.015, (1) gives the plots of

tive agreement with Nikuradse’s data, right from the on-

tively the same even if the value of any of the parameters
is changed widely. In particular, there is always a hump
and there are always bellies: these are robust features
which are closely connected with the overall form of the
spectrum of turbulent energy. These connections will be-
come apparent after the discussion that follows.

To help interpreting our results, we compute f without
including the correction for the energy range—that is,
setting γ = 0. In this case, the integral of (1) may be

We are ready to explain the unfolding of Nikuradse’s
data in terms of the varying habits of momentum trans-
fer with increasing Re (Fig. 4). At relatively low Re, the
inertial range is immature, and the momentum transfer
is dominated by eddies in the energy range, whose veloc-
ity scales with V , and therefore with Re. Consequently,
an increase in Re leads to a more vigorous momentum

transfer—and to an increase in f . This eﬀect explains
the rising part of the hump. At higher Re, the momen-
tum transfer is dominated by eddies of size s ≈ aη ≫ r.
Since η ∼ Re
, with increasing Re the momentum
transfer is eﬀected by ever smaller (and slower) eddies,
and f lessens as Re continues to increase. This eﬀect ex-
plains the plunging part of the hump—the part governed
by Blasius’s scaling. At intermediate Re, s = r + aη with
r ≈ aη. Due to the decrease in η, s continues to lessen as
Re continues to increase, but at a lower rate than before,
when it was s ≈ aη ≫ r. Thus, the curve associated
with r deviates from Blasius’s scaling and starts to trace
a belly. As η continues to decrease, the dominant ed-
dies become decidedly larger than the smaller eddies in
the inertial range, which is well established now, and any
lingering dissipation at lengthscales larger than s must
cease. This eﬀect explains the rising part of the belly.
Last, at high Re, s ≈ r ≫ aη. As Re increases fur-
ther, η lessens and new, smaller eddies populate the ﬂow
and become jumbled with the preexisting eddies. Yet
the momentum transfer continues to be dominated by
eddies of size r, and f remains invariant. This eﬀect ex-
plains Nikuradse’s data at high Re, where f is governed
by Strickler’s scaling.

We have predicated our main result, equation (1), on
two noteworthy assumptions. We now discuss these as-
sumptions in turn.

First, we have assumed that an eddy of size s is al-
ways present in the cove between each pair of consec-
utive roughness elements (Fig. 2). (Note that s is the
size of the largest eddy that ﬁts a cove. Thus, an eddy
of size s can be present in every cove.
In our deriva-
tion we have gone further and assumed that an eddy of
size s is
indeed present in every cove.) To justify our

assumption, we may recall that the turbulent eddies of
the phenomenological theory are space-ﬁlling [11]. Al-
ternatively, we may think of the eddies of size s as a
form of coherent structure which for prolonged periods
of time retains a discernible identity within the general
(Indeed, in the case
unrest of the turbulent ﬂow [14].
r = 0, it is natural to liken the eddies of size s ∼ η to the
best-know form of coherent structure: the attached wall
eddies that have frequently been observed in turbulent
ﬂows over hydraulically smooth walls.) Theoretical work
on the origin of coherent structures indicates that numer-
ous instabilities are possible leading to arrays of wall ed-
dies of speciﬁc wavelengths [15, 16]. Interestingly, it has
been conjectured that the presence of periodic forms of
wall roughness could trigger instabilities of similar wave-
length [15]. This conjecture helps explain a puzzle posed
by Nikuradse’s data: given that turbulence involves a
wide spectrum of wavelengths, Why should r, which is
just one wavelength within that spectrum, have such a
strong inﬂuence on the turbulent friction? The puzzle is
explained if the roughness elements of size r induce ed-
dies of a similar size in the vicinity of the wall and if, as
suggested by our derivation, these eddies eﬀect most of
the momentum transfer [17].

Second, we have assumed that the eddies are governed
by the phenomenological theory of turbulence. The the-
ory was originally derived for isotropic and homogeneous
ﬂows, but recent research [18] suggests that it applies
to much more general ﬂows as well. Our results indi-
cate that even where the ﬂow is highly anisotropic and
inhomogeneous—as is the case in the vicinity of a wall—
the theory gives a ﬁrst-order solution that embodies the
essential structure of the complete solution (including the
correct scalings of Blasius and Strickler) and is in detailed
qualitative agreement with the observed phenomenology.
Remarkably, the qualitative agreement holds starting at
the very onset of turbulence, in accord with experimen-
tal evidence that “in pipes, turbulence sets in suddenly
and fully, without intermediate states and without a clear
stability boundary” [4]. The deﬁciencies in quantitative
agreement point to a need for higher-order corrections to
account for the eﬀect of the roughness elements on the

dissipation range as well as for the eﬀect of the overall
geometry on the energy range.

The discussion of our assumptions in the last two para-
graphs suggest a convergence of the statistical and the
coherent-structure views of turbulence. It has been fre-
quently pointed out that these two views are not nec-
essarily mutually exclusive: a population of persistent
eddies self-organized in a coherent structure may coex-
ist with a population of ephemeral eddies that embodies
the tumult usually associated with the statistical view
[11, 14, 19]. Our results indicate that to a ﬁrst approx-
imation both populations share a common spectrum of
turbulent energy: that of the phenomenological theory.
Thus, because the coherent structure mirrors the con-
tours of the wall and dominates the momentum transfer,
the dependence of the turbulent friction on the rough-
ness and the Reynolds number is a direct manifestation
of the distribution of turbulent energy given by the phe-
nomenological theory. This close relation between the
turbulent friction and the phenomenological theory may
be summarized in the following observation: the simi-
larity exponents of Blasius and Strickler are but recast
forms of the exponent of the Kolmog´orov spectrum.

[6] In Nikuradse’s experiments the average distance between
roughness elements, λ, was about the same as the height
of the roughness elements, r. This is the type of single-
lengthscale rough wall that concerns us here. For ﬂows
on rough walls of this type, there are always bellies in
the log-log plots of f vs. Re. (For similar results on open
channels, see Varwick’s data in, for example, O. Kirsh-
mer, Revue G´en´erale de L’Hydraulique 51, 115 (1949).)
H. M. Morris appears to have been the ﬁrst in propos-
ing a classiﬁcation of single-lengthscale rough walls based
on the value of the dimensionless ratio λ/r (Transactions
ASME, 120 373 (1955)). Morris pointed out that the bel-
lies broaden as a result of an increase in the ratio λ/r.
For multiple-lengthscale walls that contain roughness el-
ements of many diﬀerent sizes (as is commonly the case
in commercial pipes), the bellies may be absent; see, for
example, the paper by Kirshmer cited above.

[20] Our schematic of Fig. 2 may seem to resemble the “d-type
roughness” of A. E. Perry, W. H. Schoﬁeld, and P. N. Jou-
bert, J. Fluid Mech. 37, 383 (1969). According to these
authors, for this type of roughness the turbulent fric-
tion does not asymptotically approach a constant value
at high Re. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Jimenez [1],
the distinction between k-type roughness (by deﬁnition,
the type of roughness in Nikuradse’s pipes) and d-type
roughness appears to have been predicated on limited
experimental data, and must be regarded with caution.
More precisely, Raupach et al. [2] have remarked that “it
is likely that the observed behavior of ‘d-type’ roughness
is related to the diﬃculty of simultaneously achieving
high roughness Reynolds numbers and a large separa-
tion between δ and roughness lengthscales in laboratory
boundary layers,” where δ is the thickness of the tur-
bulent boundary layer (note that Perry et al. performed
their experiments on plates). In any case, the schematic
of Fig. 2 represents the single-lengthscale rough walls of
Nikuradse’s experiments [6] and does lead to predictions
that are in accord with those experiments.

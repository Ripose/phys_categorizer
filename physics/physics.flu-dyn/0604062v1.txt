Recurrent motions within plane Couette turbulence

Abstract

We describe accurate computations of three-dimensional periodic and relative periodic mo-
tions within plane Couette turbulence at Re = 400. To ensure that the computed solutions are
true solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, careful attention is paid to time discretization
errors and to spatial resolution. All the computed solutions are linearly unstable. While di-
rect numerical simulation helps us understand the statistics of turbulent ﬂuid ﬂows, elucidation
of the geometry of turbulent ﬂows in phase space requires the computation of steady states,
traveling waves, periodic motions, and close recurrences. The computed solutions are used as a
basis to discuss the manner in which the geometry of turbulent dynamics in phase space can be
understood. The method used for computing these solutions is described in detail.

Introduction

1.1 Turbulence and recurrence

Although turbulence is characterized by instability and sensitive dependence on initial conditions,
the number of unstable directions in low Reynolds number turbulence can be limited. Streaks that
are experimentally observed in near-wall turbulence (Kline et al., 1967; Smith and Metzler, 1983)
as well as the striking recurrences observed in direct numerical simulation (Hamilton et al., 1995;
Waleﬀe, 1997) are probably related to this low dimensionality. Low dimensionality here refers to
the number of unstable directions, or to the dimension of the unstable manifold, and not to the
number of grid points necessary to resolve the ﬂow, a number that can be quite large.

Recurrence, the tendency of certain dynamical systems to revisit points close to their initial state
in phase space after extended excursions, has long been a central and unifying idea in dynamics.
The relevance of recurrence to long term dynamics is captured in a most general way by the
Poincar´e recurrence theorem (Katok and Hasselblatt, 1995). In its early days, this theorem gave
rise to troubling questions about the foundations of statistical mechanics. The number of grid
points needed to resolve low Reynolds number turbulence can be in the range 104 to 106 and
quite large, but is certainly not as large as the number of degrees of freedom typical of statistical
mechanics. Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence is that low Reynolds number turbulence is governed by
equations that are not Hamiltonian and in which viscosity damps a number of high wavenumbers.
The asymptotic set of points that turbulent dynamics settles on once the transients are quickly
eliminated can be a low dimensional manifold, a fact that will be algorithmically exploited in this
paper.

The combination of instability, boundedness in phase space, and the low dimensionality of the
asymptotic set of points naturally implies the existence of periodic motions. This combination
is the basis of the theory of hyperbolic sets (Katok and Hasselblatt, 1995) and the density of
periodic points in uniformly hyperbolic sets is one of the main features of this theory. Knowledge
of periodic motions can be vital to understanding the dynamics as noted by G.D. Birkhoﬀ (1920):
It seems doubtful if any other mode of satisfactory description is possible. The intuitive basis for
this is easily stated: any motion of a dynamical system must tend with lapse of time towards a
characteristic cyclic mode of behavior. Thus, in characterizing the motions of a dynamical system,
those of periodic type are of central importance and simplicity. The possibility of using recurrences
to understand turbulence and allusions to that possibility by earlier researchers were discussed
by Christiansen et al. (1997). Computing the periodic motions within a turbulent set can be
a formidable problem because the computational grid needs to be ﬁne enough if the computed
solutions are to correspond to true solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, and for such grids, the
matrices that occur in Newton’s method can be too large even to ﬁt into a computer’s memory.
Another problem is that iterations based on Newton’s method converge only if the initial guess is
very close to a periodic solution. Methods that overcome both these problems will be given in this
paper and those methods will be used to compute some solutions within plane Couette turbulence.
The way to deduce geometric information about a chaotic ﬂow by computing periodic mo-
x + y),
tions can be illustrated using the Lorenz equations. The Lorenz equations ˙x = 10(
˙y =
8z/3 were derived to argue that turbulence in ﬂuid ﬂows
results from deterministic diﬀerential equations and is not an eﬀect of unknown stochastic terms
(Lorenz, 1963)— an argument that turned out to be correct. The top part of Figure 1 shows two
simple periodic solutions of the Lorenz equations. Simple solutions such as these can be used to

this intersection appears to be a curve, it is in fact a fractal and an inﬁnite complex of curves. The

construct more complicated solutions (Viswanath, 2003). The important point is that various so-
lutions that lie on the Lorenz attractor can be classiﬁed on the basis of the sequence in which they
alternate between the left half and the right half. For example, the periodic solution in the top
left plot of Figure 1 alternates regularly between the left half and the right half, while the periodic
solution shown next to it visits the left half three times for every visit of the right half. This type
of classiﬁcation of periodic solutions is not only useful for computing more periodic solutions, but
can also be used to reveal much of the geometry of the Lorenz attractor (Viswanath, 2003, 2004).
In the bottom part of Figure 1, it is shown that although the intersection of the Lorenz attractor
with a Poincar´e section appears to be a 1-dimensional curve, that curve splits into two when a
small portion of it is enlarged by a factor of about 105. The computation shown in the lower right
plot of Figure 1 was carried out using periodic solutions and it is possible to compute the fractal
structure of the Lorenz attractor in great detail (Viswanath, 2003, 2004).

Although the Lorenz equations have a mere three degrees of freedom, they were good enough to
point out that turbulence in ﬂuid ﬂows is characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
They also suggest an approach to ﬁguring out the geometry of turbulence in phase space. One has
to start by ﬁnding turbulent solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that are either traveling
waves or periodic or relative periodic motions. Once a number of solutions of these types have
been found, it is necessary to look for a way to classify the solutions. The third step is to use this
classiﬁcation system to compute even more solutions. Although this paper will focus on the ﬁrst
step by ﬁnding some solutions within plane Couette turbulence, the importance of the third step

accurately. In addition, it may be possible to reproduce the computed solutions in experiments.

1.2 Recurrent solutions of plane Couette ﬂow

Plane Couette ﬂow is driven by two parallel walls at y =
1, 0, 0).
The x, y, and z directions are called streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise, respectively. Natural
units will be used throughout this paper and Re will denote the Reynolds number based on half of
the wall separation and half of the diﬀerence between the wall velocities. The laminar solution
u = (y, 0, 0) is linearly stable for all Re (Romanov, 1973). Sustained turbulence is observed
both experimentally and computationally for Re large enough. For instance, in some experiments
turbulent spots are sustained for Re = 360 (Bech et al., 1995).

±

We carry out computations at Re = 400. The computational domain is made ﬁnite by imposing
periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise and spanwise directions. We denote the streamwise
and spanwise lengths of the computational box by 2πΛx and 2πΛz. Hamilton et al. (1995) deter-
mined that the choice Λx = 0.875 and Λz = 0.6 gives a computational box which is large enough
to sustain turbulence while being small enough to permit well resolved computations. Statistics of
near wall turbulence as well as dynamical features such as spanwise streaks and streamwise rolls
are reproduced quite well in this box (Hamilton et al., 1995; Jim´enez et al., 2005; Waleﬀe, 2003).
Most of our computations use this box.

The traveling wave solutions of plane Couette turbulence discovered within the last ten years
or so will be useful in any attempt to understand the dynamics of plane Couette turbulence.
Three dimensional steady solutions related to plane Couette turbulence were constructed by Nagata
(1990).
In his method, steady solutions of plane Couette ﬂow were obtained by starting from
solutions of Taylor-Couette ﬂow with rotating cyclinders. Clever and Busse (1997) found that
some perturbations of these steady solutions evolved periodically in time with short periods.

More solutions were constructed by appealing to the self-sustained process which was isolated
and studied by Waleﬀe and others (Hamilton et al., 1995; Waleﬀe, 1995, 1997). There are three
things that go into the initial construction of these solutions in the method introduced by Waleﬀe
(1998, 2001, 2003). Firstly, streamwise rolls (0, v(y, z), w(y, z)) are chosen such that both v and
w have simple analytic forms. Secondly, the advection diﬀusion equation v ∂u/∂y + w ∂u/∂z =
1
u is solved for u(y, z). The u(y, z) so obtained is obviously independent of the stream-
Re △
wise direction. In addition, u(y, z) has strong spanwise variation which makes the velocity ﬁeld
u = (u(y, z), v(y, z), w(y, z)) streaky. However, this velocity ﬁeld is not a steady solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations. The third part of the construction is to add a body force to the Navier-
Stokes equations to make this velocity ﬁeld a solution of the augmented set of equations. In this
construction, the streaks are O(1), the rolls are O(1/Re), and the body force is O(1/Re2).

In addition to rolls and streaks, the self-sustaining process also includes an instability caused
by inﬂections in the spanwise variation of the streamwise velocity, and a nonlinear interaction that
prevents the rolls from vanishing as a result of viscous decay (Waleﬀe, 1997). The streak instability
has a predominant role in the continuation procedure used to make the body force zero. Waleﬀe
(2003) has given various values of Λx and Λz, with Re = 400, for which the body force can be made
zero to obtain traveling wave solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. There is a free parameter
in the initial construction of the rolls which means that what is obtained by this method is a
1-parameter family of symmetric traveling waves.

Initially the solutions are obtained using free-slip boundaries. These solutions can be continued

Figure 2: The plot above shows four solutions of plane Couette ﬂow in the energy input (I) -
dissipation (D) plane. The laminar solution (u, v, w) = (y, 0, 0) would be located at (1, 1) on this
plane. The solutions near (2, 2) and (2.7, 2.7) are labeled P1 and P2, respectively. P4 is the solution
that attains the highest values of D, and the fourth solution shown on the plot is P3. Filled circles
are placed at equispaced intervals with respect to the periods of P3 and P4.

past saddle-node bifurcations to obtain “upper branch” solutions (Waleﬀe, 2003). Traveling wave
solutions with no-slip boundaries and traveling wave solutions of pressure driven channel ﬂows are
obtained by continuation methods (Waleﬀe, 2003). This method based on rolls and streaks has been
adapted to pressure driven pipe ﬂows by Faisst and Eckhardt (2003) and by Wedin and Kerswell
(2004).

Itano and Toh (2001) computed a traveling wave solution of a pressure driven channel ﬂow by
a method that sheds some light on the dynamics of that ﬂow. Their method is to start with a
velocity ﬁeld (u, v, w) obtained from a turbulent ﬂow. This ﬁeld is split into two parts, the ﬁrst of
which is obtained by averaging the velocity ﬁeld in the streamwise direction. If the second part is
completely subtracted from the initial velocity ﬁeld, the ﬂow simply goes to the laminar solution.
They were able to obtain an unsymmetric traveling wave solution by gradually adding more and
more of the second part to the ﬁrst part of the initial velocity ﬁeld.

The box with Λx = 0.875 and Λz = 0.6 was used by Kawahara and Kida (2001) to ﬁnd two
periodic solutions of plane Couette ﬂow at Re = 400. Both solutions were found using a 16
16
grid (16 Fourier points in the x and z directions and 33 Chebyshev points in the y direction). One of
their solutions has a period of 85.5 and was obtained from a steady solution found by Nagata (1990)
through a bifurcation. The other solution, which was reported to have a period of 64.7, is in a region
of phase space where the spatial resolution requirements are more demanding. Kawahara and Kida
(2001) reported that a direction set method was used to compute this solution. They also reported
that when the initial states for their two periodic solutions were integrated for one full period the
ﬁnal states were within 1% of the initial states on their 16

16 grid.

For the laminar solution (u, v, w) = (y, 0, 0), both these integrals evaluate to 1/Re. The quantities
D and I used by Figure 2 are obtained by multiplying (1.1) and (1.2) by Re, respectively.

The equations of plane Couette ﬂow are unchanged by translation in the streamwise and span-
wise directions. Therefore if an initial velocity ﬁeld is shifted in the x and z directions, the velocity
ﬁeld is merely shifted by exactly the same amounts in the x and z directions at all future times. In
the presence of this invariance, the right notion of recurrence is to require that the ﬁnal velocity
ﬁeld match the initial velocity after shifts in the x and z directions that will be denoted by sx and
sz. A similar situation arises in the planar N-body problem whose equations are unchanged by
rotations. Those equations do not allow any steady states or ﬁxed points, but a number of ﬁxed
points can be found in a rotating frame and those ﬁxed points are called central conﬁgurations
(Meyer and Hall, 1992).

In looking for periodic solutions within plane Couette ﬂow, we allow for shifts. If the initial
velocity ﬁeld is ui(x, y, z) and the velocity ﬁeld after integrating the initial velocity ﬁeld for one
full period is uf (x, y, z), we require ui(x, y, z) = uf (x
sz). Solutions that satisfy this
property are called relative periodic solutions. Relative periodic solutions are to periodic solutions
what traveling waves are to steady solutions. The period and the shifts for P1, P2, P3, and P4 are
shown in Table 1.

We are certain that P1 and P3 are relative periodic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations
for plane Couette ﬂow and P4 too is very likely to be such a solution. However, P2 seems to be
a close recurrence that is not exact. The grid needs to be ﬁner to resolve solutions that become
very turbulent by making excursions to parts of the D against I plane shown in Figure 2 with
larger values of D. Thus P1 is the easiest to resolve and P4 is the hardest to resolve. We used a
48 grid to compute P4. A detailed

discussion of the accuracy of these computations can be found in later sections. Here we note that
some of these solutions have been veriﬁed by Gibson using his Channel Flow code (Gibson, 2002),
and that in every case we veriﬁed the accuracy of the computed solution by moving it to a ﬁner
grid. For example, the accuracy of P4 was veriﬁed using a 96

96 grid.

97

The solution P1 is exactly periodic with sx = sz = 0 because it satisﬁes some special symmetries.

×

×

However, nonzero shifts must be expected for typical recurrences.

The solutions P1, P2, P3, and P4 were found by setting up equations that match the initial
velocity ﬁeld and the ﬁnal velocity ﬁeld, modulo the shifts sx and sz, after a period T . Conditions
were imposed that give equations that can be used to solve for the period T and the shifts sx and
sz. The total number of equations can exceed 105, and the matrices that result if the equations are
linearized to compute the Newton step are dense. Direct computation of the Newton step is infea-
sible. The Newton step was computed using a Krylov subspace method. Newton-Krylov methods
have been used in diverse contexts (Kelley, 2003). They were used to compute steady solutions by
Edwards et al. (1994). Especially notable is the work of Sanche´z et al. (2004) who used a Newton-
Krylov method to ﬁnd laminar periodic motions of the 2-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and
gave a clear explanation of why Newton-Krylov methods are appropriate for dissipative problems.
In their work, Sanche´z et al. (2004) began with a known solution of the 2-dimensional Navier-
Stokes equations, continued it using Newton’s method, and computed various bifurcations. The
initial guesses that could be obtained within 3-dimensional plane Couette turbulence were very
inaccurate and the Newton iteration does not converge to solutions such as P1, P2, P3, and P4
by itself. The method that we derive uses the so-called hook step (Dennis and Schnabel, 1996)
initially. We explain how to compute the hook step within a Krylov subspace in Section 3.

Direct numerical simulations of turbulence have been very successful in reproducing experimen-
tally observed statistics of turbulent ﬂows (Moin and Mahesh, 1998). Indeed, the simulation of fully
developed turbulence within a channel by Kim et al. (1987), whose numerical method we use, con-
tained a detailed discussion of turbulence statistics. It must be noted that even poorly resolved sim-
ulations yield good agreement with respect to rms velocities and other statistics (Kleiser and Zang,
1991). Therefore statistics alone cannot be used to judge the resolution of the computational grid.
Poor resolution is known to aﬀect the time to transition to turbulence and the occurrence of the
transition itself (Kleiser and Zang, 1991; Orszag and Kells, 1980). Although we focus on dynam-
ics, and not statistics, we note that a detailed knowledge of dynamics can sometimes be used to
compute statistical averages accurately (Cvitanovi´c et al., 2005).

where j = 0, 1, . . . , M .

For discretizing time, it is best to use a method such as CNAB that treats the viscous terms in
(2.2a), (2.2b), (2.4a), and (2.4b) implicitly, and the other terms explicitly. The stability restriction
on the time step appears to be mainly due to the nonlinear advection terms. Ascher et al. (1997)
have derived some implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods that use explicit Runge-Kutta methods
whose stability regions include a large portion of the imaginary axis. The point is that these
methods may be able to take much longer time steps. We implemented their (2, 2, 2) second order
method and their (4, 4, 3) third order method.

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the error on time step for three diﬀerent discretizations of time.
It is indeed true that the implicit-explicit methods can take longer time steps, but their time steps
are also more expensive. The total discretization error in most of our numerical integrations of plane
Couette turbulence are dominated by spatial discretization error and not by time discretization
error, as will become clear. For these reasons, we found CNAB to be the best choice for most of
our computations.

Time integration of the equations that govern plane Couette ﬂow is the workhorse in our method
for computing relative periodic solutions. To prepare the way for that method, it is necessary to
think of the spatially discretized equations as constituting a system of the form ˙X = f (X) with
explicit knowledge of f . It is also necessary to ﬁnd out the degrees of freedom that constitute X
and their total count in terms of L, M , and N . We wrote down (2.2a), (2.2b), (2.4a), and (2.4b)
to facilitate these preparatory steps.

used for numerical time integration and it is not necessary to compute f eﬃciently.

Our code for numerical integration uses the LAPACK and FFTW software libraries. We tested
the code by reproducing the growth and decay rates of three-dimensional solutions of the Orr-
Sommerfeld equation (Orszag and Kells, 1980). Three diﬀerent time integrators were compared
with each other. Our code can compute the nonlinear terms using any one of the advection, rota-
tion, and skew-symmetric forms. We reproduced some earlier computations of plane Couette ﬂow
(Hamilton et al., 1995; Orszag and Kells, 1980). The correctness and accuracy of the implementa-
tion of f (X) was checked using the code for time integration of plane Couette ﬂow.

3 Computation of relative periodic solutions

1) + (2M

The method for computing relative periodic solutions will be given in terms of the ˙X = f (X)
system, and points in the phase space of that system will be denoted by subscripting X and Y .
However, most of the computational work is done in terms of the ¯u, ¯w, v, η system (2.2a)-(2.2d).
Given a velocity ﬁeld speciﬁed in terms of ¯u, ¯w, v, and η it is possible to obtain a unique point
X in 2(M
1) dimensional space, as explained in the previous
section, and given such a point it is possible to construct a velocity ﬁeld that satisﬁes the boundary
conditions of plane Couette ﬂow. The solution of the initial value problem ˙X = f (X), X(0) = X0,
is denoted by X(t; X0). To compute X(t; X0), X0 is converted into a velocity ﬁeld that satisﬁes
the boundary conditions of plane Couette ﬂow, and that velocity ﬁeld is numerically integrated for
the time interval t using (2.2a), (2.2b), (2.4a), (2.4b), and the method indicated in the previous
section. The resulting velocity ﬁeld is used to obtain the point X(t; X0).

The operators
T2 are inﬁnitesimal generators of the group of translations along the stream-
wise and spanwise directions. The shift in (3.1) is given by esxT1eszT2v(x, y, z). To shift a velocity
ﬁeld given by ¯u, ¯w, v, and η by sx along x and by sz along z, we need only apply esxT1eszT2 to v
and η. To shift a velocity ﬁeld given by X0, we can convert X0 to ¯u, ¯w, v, η, shift v and η, and
then convert back. The shift operation on X0 will be denoted by esxT1eszT2X0.

The Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette ﬂow are unchanged by shifts in the x and z

directions. In terms of

˙X = f (X), this property becomes f (esxT1eszT2X) = esxT1eszT2f (X).

Suppose X0 gives an initial velocity ﬁeld for plane Couette ﬂow and X1 is a perturbation of X0.

In ﬁnding relative periodic motions, we will often need to compute the matrix vector product

∂X(t; X0)
∂X0

X1.

The Jacobian in (3.3) is too large a matrix to be formed explicitly. However, the matrix vector
product (3.3) can be computed eﬃciently as follows. Suppose Y0 = X(t; X0). Then Y0 is computed
by integrating the initial velocity ﬁeld X0 for time t. Let ǫ be a small number and let Y1 = X(t; X0 +
ǫX1). To approximate (3.3), Y1 is computed in the same manner as Y0 and the approximation to
Y0)/ǫ. With careful choice of ǫ, it is possible to obtain (3.3) with more
(3.3) is taken to be (Y1 −
than 7 digits of accuracy in IEEE double precision arithmetic. If t is too large, it may be necessary
to break up t into smaller blocks of time and factorize the Jacobian in (3.3) so that exactly one
factor corresponds to each block of time. The procedure just described for computing the matrix
vector product must then be repeated for each block of time.

To ﬁnd a relative periodic solution of plane Couette ﬂow, we have to ﬁnd an initial velocity ﬁeld

X0, a period T , and shifts sx and sz such that

with small relative errors. It is possible to come up with good initial guesses if the dynamics is
understood in detail. But not much is known about the geometry of the dynamics of turbulent
ﬂows in phase space, and indeed, the central motivation for computing relative periodic solutions
is to understand that geometry better. We generated initial guesses by looking at data from direct
numerical simulation of plane Couette turbulence, and in all cases the relative error of the initial
guess was around 50%. The iteration for computing relative periodic motions that satisfy (3.4) has
to be robust enough to converge from such inaccurate initial guesses.

We ﬁrst set up the Newton iteration, although the Newton iteration by itself is entirely inade-
quate. Let X0, sx, sz, T be our initial guess for solving (3.4) and let Y0 = e−sxT1e−szT2X(T ; X0).
If we assume X0 + δX0, sx + δsx, sz + δsz, T + δT to be the solution of (3.4) that is close to the
initial guess and linearize about the initial guess, we get

0 denotes the transpose of δX0. Since the Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette ﬂow
are unchanged by shifts in the x and z directions, shifting X0 in the x or z directions will only shift
Y0 in the x and z directions. The ﬁrst two equations in (3.7) above require that the correction δX0 to
X0 must not have components that shift X0 inﬁnitesimally in the x or z directions. If the correction
δX0 slightly advances X0 along the ﬂow induced by ˙X = f (X), the corrected velocity ﬁeld will
remain on the same orbit. The third equation in (3.7) requires that the correction δX0 must have
no component along f (X0). The equations (3.6) and (3.7) together constitute the Newton system.

It turns out to be convenient to rewrite the Newton system as M σ = ρ, where

The dimension of M can easily exceed 105. Because the discretization we use is spectral, M is
a dense matrix. The matrix M is too big even to be formed and stored in computer memory, and
direct methods are of no use in solving M σ = ρ.

We solved M σ = ρ for σ using the GMRES method (Trefethen and Bau, 1997). At its dth
step, GMRES ﬁnds an approximate solution σd of M σ = ρ, and the residual error
is
equal to the quantity min
, where the minimum is taken over all polynomials of dth degree

with pd(0) = 1. All norms are Euclidean. Although the polynomials pd are not explicitly formed
by GMRES, the matrix approximation problem in terms of pd is very helpful in understanding
whether GMRES is likely to converge to a solution in a reasonable number of iterations or not
(Trefethen and Bau, 1997). If there are polynomials pd of degree d with pd(0) = 1 and d small
such that
is small, we expect GMRES to converge quickly. Such polynomials exist if the
spectrum of M is concentrated in a few small regions of the complex plane.
GMRES ﬁnds the approximate solution σd at the dth step as follows.

It begins by ﬁnding
a matrix Qd with d orthonormal columns, and with the ﬁrst column equal to ρ/

The approximate solution σd is taken to be Qd˜σd.

In dissipative systems such as the Navier-Stokes equations, even when the number of degrees
of freedom due to spatial discretization is as large as 105, most of the spatial modes are quickly
damped by viscosity and there are only a few unstable directions. As pointed out by Sanche´z et al.
(2004), this implies that most of the singular values of the matrix ∂X(T ;X0)
are close to 0. This
fact about the singular values in turn implies that most of the eigenvalues of the matrix M given
by (3.8) are close to 1. We expect some polynomials pd with pd(0) = 1 and some roots close to 1
to give small values for

Because GMRES maintains and uses a basis for a Krylov subspace whose dimension increases
with each step, slow convergence may place excessive demands upon computer memory. This
problem can be circumvented by restarting GMRES or by using Krylov subspace methods that
employ short recurrences (Trefethen and Bau, 1997).
In our computations of relative periodic
solutions of plane Couette ﬂow, convergence of GMRES was never a problem. In every instance, it
was possible to solve M σ = ρ with a relative residual error of .001 using around 30 or fewer steps
of GMRES.

The real problem is that the Newton iteration does not converge to a solution of (3.4) as the
initial guesses are too far away from any relative periodic solutions. A commonly used device is to
damp the Newton steps to improve convergence. If σ is the Newton step, the damped Newton step
is taken to be ασ for some α
(0, 1]. Damping has its uses, but we were not able to get convergence
to relative periodic motions of plane Couette ﬂow by simply damping the Newton steps.

∈

The method we used was based on the hook step (Dennis and Schnabel, 1996). In this method,
one begins by asking why the Newton step can go so wrong. The Newton step is obtained by
linearizing (3.4) around an initial guess and the domain of validity of the linearization will be some
small region about the initial guess. If the Newton step is outside this region, it is of not much
use. Therefore if we think that the linearization is meaningful as long as the step does not take us
away from the initial guess by a distance that is more than r, it is best to obtain the step σ by

With M being a large and dense matrix, direct methods are no more useful for this constrained
minimization problem than they were for ﬁnding the Newton step. We look for a solution of
this constrained minimization problem within Krylov subspaces of M and take the solution of the
constrained minimization problem to be of the form σ = Qd˜σd, where ˜σd is a d dimensional vector.

Good choices of r are necessary to get good convergence. Given r, the value of the minimum
r will be close to the new error after a step of length r, if the linearization is
(3.9) with
trustworthy. Whether r is too small or too large can be determined by comparing the reduction in
the error predicted by the linearization with the actual reduction in the error found by substituting
the initial guess and its corrected version into the nonlinear equation (3.4). This information can
be used to change r, or the trust region, from step to step (Dennis and Schnabel, 1996).

respectively. Neither plot shows the energy that corresponds to the wavenumber 0. The third plot
graphs energy against wall-normal Chebyshev mode. All three plots correspond to the periodic
solution P1.

In optimization problems where some of the variables take values in a range that is far removed
from that of others by several orders of magnitude, it is useful to rescale some of the variables
(Dennis and Schnabel, 1996). This rescaling does not change the Newton step at all, but it can
greatly change the hook step described above. In eﬀect, the trust region used for computing the
hook step is allowed to be an ellipsoid around the initial guess instead of being just a sphere. In
some of our computations, we rescaled sx, sz, and T .

4 Computation of traveling wave solutions

It is possible to modify the method given in the previous section to compute traveling wave solutions.
Only minimal modiﬁcations are necessary. Instead of allowing the period T to vary from iteration
to iteration, the ﬁrst modiﬁcation is to ﬁx T at a value that is deﬁnitely smaller than the period of
any periodic or relative periodic solution. The second modiﬁcation is to drop the last of the three
equations in (3.7) to get a square system of equations for δX0, δsx, and δsz.

For some traveling waves, the symmetry of the velocity ﬁeld may imply in advance that sx =
sz = 0 (Waleﬀe, 2003). For such traveling waves, we set sx = sz = 0 and drop the ﬁrst two
equations of (3.7) as well.

We moved one of Waleﬀe’s traveling wave solutions (Waleﬀe, 2003), whose data is posted pub-

resolution. The sum of the energy in the streamwise wave numbers and the sum over the spanwise
wave numbers both equal the total energy of the velocity ﬁeld. That is because the Fourier modes
are orthogonal with respect to the uniform measure. However, the Chebyshev polynomials are not
orthogonal with respect to the uniform measure and there is no unique way to break up the energy
across the Chebyshev modes. To explain the third plot in Figure 4, we deﬁne

The third plot of Figure 4 is obtained by expressing E(y) as a linear combination of Chebyshev
polynomials.

The energy falls by several orders of magnitude in each of the three plots in Figure 4. There can
be no doubt that the computation is well resolved. The points that lie in the bottom part of the
third plot are explained by a symmetry of the velocity ﬁeld of the period orbit P1. This symmetry
is not enforced in our computation, and therefore Chebyshev coeﬃcients of E(y) that should be
zero have magnitudes that depend upon the discretization error. It is clear from the three plots of
Figure 4 that the discretization error is mainly from the spanwise direction. These plots indicate
that the relative discretization error is about 10−5 when the velocity ﬁeld of the periodic solution
P1 is represented on a 32

The error in the computed periodic solution as given by (3.5) can be made smaller than 10−10.
In that error estimate, X(T ; X0) is obtained by numerically integrating the Navier-Stokes equation
for plane Couette ﬂow. Spatial and time discretization errors are ignored by that estimate. The
discussion of the spatial discretization error in this section and the discussion of the time discretiza-
tion error in Section 2 suggest that the computed periodic solution P1 approximates a true periodic

32 grid.

5.2 Streaks

The streakiness of the velocity ﬁeld along the periodic solution P1 can be seen from the plots in
Figure 5. As evident from Figure 2, the relative periodic solution P4 is more turbulent than P1.
The plots of Figure 6 show that the velocity ﬁeld along P4 is less streaky, with the variation of the
streamwise velocity in the streamwise direction being more pronounced, and that the breakdown
of streaks is more violent. Part of the ﬂuid in the y = √2/2 section moves backward even though
that section is closer to the top wall than to the bottom wall. P4 was computed on a 48
48
grid. It approximates a relative periodic solution within plane Couette turbulence with better than
1% accuracy. A more accurate computation of P4 would require an even ﬁner grid, and it might be
best to use the skew-symmetric form for the nonlinear term of the Navier-Stokes equation (Horiuti,
1987; Zang, 1991).

Figure 7 corresponds to P2. The plots at t = T are very similar but not identical to the plots
at t = 0. P2 could be a close recurrence that is not actually a relative periodic solution. P2 might
be close to an invariant and normally hyperbolic torus. A complement of the tangent space of a
normally hyperbolic torus can be split into stable and unstable directions.

5.3 Statistics

Figure 9 shows some statistics for P1 and P3. The form of the mean streamwise velocity near the
walls and the inﬂection in the mean streamwise velocity near y = 0 are typical of near wall tur-
bulence and plane Couette turbulence. The rms velocities compare well with earlier computations
(Jim´enez et al., 2005; Kawahara and Kida, 2001; Waleﬀe, 2003).

5.4 Characteristic multipliers

The characteristic multipliers of a relative periodic solution of plane Couette ﬂow are the eigenvalues
of

−sxT1e
e

−szT2 ∂X(T ; X0)

,

∂X0

(5.1)

if X0 gives the initial velocity ﬁeld of that solution, T its period, sx the shift in the streamwise
direction, and sz the shift in the spanwise direction. If X0 is shifted by an inﬁnitesimal amount in the
x or z directions, X(T ; X0) also shifts by the same amount. Thus there must be two characteristic
multipliers equal to 1. A third characteristic multiplier must also equal 1 and correspond to
perturbations that slightly advance X0 along the ﬂow. The eigenvalues of (5.1) that lie outside the
unit circle correspond to unstable perturbations of the initial velocity ﬁeld.

The matrix (5.1) will be large and dense. Therefore direct methods cannot be used to ﬁnd its
eigenvalues. However, it is possible to apply the matrix (5.1) to vectors as discussed below (3.3).
We used the Arnoldi iteration (Trefethen and Bau, 1997) to ﬁnd the characteristic multipliers of
P1, P2, and P3. Given a starting vector v and a matrix M , the dth step of the Arnoldi iteration
is minimum among all monic polynomials

vector v can be important. To ﬁnd the characteristic multipliers of a relative periodic solution
whose initial velocity ﬁeld is given by X0, we used X0 as the starting vector.

Only one characteristic multiplier of P1 seems to lie outside the unit circle and that characteristic
multiplier is equal to 24.5. Three characteristic multipliers inside the unit circle equal 0.75, 0.64,
and 0.55. The Arnoldi iteration can introduce spurious eigenvalues (Trefethen and Bau, 1997) and
it is necessary to guard against this possibility. We checked the eigenvalues by ﬁrst perturbing
the initial velocity ﬁeld given by X0 using the eigenvector produced by the Arnoldi iteration to
obtain a new perturbed velocity ﬁeld, and then numerically integrating the perturbed velocity ﬁeld
for one full period. For all the characteristic multipliers reported here, we veriﬁed that both the
eigendirections and the predicted growth rates were accurate with an accuracy that was better than
.01%.

Eleven characteristic multipliers of P3 lie outside the unit circle. These are

12.2,

5.4, 2.2 exp(

ι0.47π), 2.03 exp(

ι0.12π), 1.97 exp(

ι0.82π), 1.22 exp(

ι0.6π), 1.3.

The only characteristic multipliers equal to 1 in magnitude were the three characteristic multipliers
discussed earlier. P3 appears to be a hyperbolic relative periodic solution. Three characteristic
0.65 and 0.58 exp(
multipliers inside the unit circle equal

ι0.14π).

Figure 9: The ﬁrst of the top two plots graphs the mean streamwise velocity ¯u(y) at four points
that are equispaced along one full period of P1. The top right plot graphs the root mean square
streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise velocities using solid, dashed, and dotted lines, respectively.
The bottom two plots correspond to P3. Thicker lines correspond to later times.

The solution P2 is a close recurrence that may not be a relative periodic solution. The ﬁnal
velocity ﬁeld, obtained after integrating for one full period T and after using the shifts given in
Table 1, is within 2% of the initial velocity ﬁeld. We computed some eigenvalues of the matrix (5.1)
that corresponds to this solution. There were at least three eigenvalues outside the unit circle.

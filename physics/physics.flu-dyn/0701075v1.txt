We report the observation of dynamo action in the VKS experiment, i.e., the generation of
magnetic ﬁeld by a strongly turbulent swirling ﬂow of liquid sodium. Both mean and ﬂuctuating
parts of the ﬁeld are studied. The dynamo threshold corresponds to a magnetic Reynolds number
Rm ∼ 30. A mean magnetic ﬁeld of order 40 G is observed 30 % above threshold at the ﬂow
lateral boundary. The rms ﬂuctuations are larger than the corresponding mean value for two of the
components. The scaling of the mean square magnetic ﬁeld is compared to a prediction previously
made for high Reynolds number ﬂows.

PACS numbers: 47.65.-d, 52.65.Kj, 91.25.Cw

The generation of electricity from mechanical work has
been one of the main achievements of physics by the end
of the XIXth century. In 1919, Larmor proposed that a
similar process can generate the magnetic ﬁeld of the sun
from the motion of an electrically conducting ﬂuid. How-
ever, ﬂuid dynamos are more complex than industrial
ones and it is not easy to ﬁnd laminar ﬂow conﬁgurations
that generate magnetic ﬁelds [1]. Two simple but clever
examples have been found in the seventies [2] and have
led more recently to successful experiments [3]. These ex-
periments have shown that the observed thresholds are
in good agreement with theoretical predictions [4] made
by considering only the mean ﬂow, whereas the satura-
tion level of the magnetic ﬁeld cannot be described with
a laminar ﬂow model (without using an ad-hoc turbu-
lent viscosity) [5]. These observations have raised many
questions: what happens for ﬂows without geometrical
constraints such that ﬂuctuations are of the same order
of magnitude as the mean ﬂow? Is the dynamo thresh-
old strongly increased due to the lack of coherence of the
driving ﬂow [6, 7] or does the prediction made as if the
mean ﬂow were acting alone still give a reasonable order
of magnitude [8]? What is the nature of the dynamo bi-
furcation in the presence of large velocity ﬂuctuations?
All these questions, and others motivated by geophysical
or astrophysical dynamos [9], have led several teams to
try to generate dynamos in ﬂows with a high level of tur-
bulence [10, 11]. We present in this letter our ﬁrst exper-
imental observation of the generation of a magnetic ﬁeld
in a von K´arm´an swirling ﬂow of liquid sodium (VKS)
for which velocity ﬂuctuations and the mean ﬂow have
comparable kinetic energy and we discuss some of the
above issues.

The experimental set-up (see Fig. 1) is similar to the
previous VKS experiments [11], but involves three modi-

FIG. 1: Sketch of the experimental set-up. The inner and
outer cylinders are made of copper (in gray). The dimension
are given in millimeter (left) and normalized by R (right).
The 3D Hall probe is located either at point P1 in the mid-
plane or P2. In both cases, the probe is nearly ﬂush with the
inner shell.

ﬁcations that will be described below. The ﬂow is gener-
ated by rotating two disks of radius 154.5 mm, 371 mm
apart in a cylindrical vessel, 2R = 412 mm in inner di-
ameter and 524 mm in length. The disks are ﬁtted with
8 curved blades of height h = 41.2 mm. These impellers
are driven at a rotation frequency up to Ω/2π = 26 Hz by
300 kW available motor power. An oil circulation in the
outer copper cylinder maintains a regulated temperature
in the range 110-160 oC. The mean ﬂow has the follow-
ing characteristics: the ﬂuid is ejected radially outward
by the disks; this drives an axial ﬂow toward the disks
along their axis and a recirculation in the opposite direc-
tion along the cylinder lateral boundary. In addition, in

the case of counter-rotating disks studied here, the pres-
ence of a strong axial shear of azimuthal velocity in the
mid-plane between the impellers generates a high level
of turbulent ﬂuctuations [12, 13]. The kinetic Reynolds
number is Re = KR2Ω/ν, where ν is the kinematic vis-
cosity and K = 0.6 is a coeﬃcient that measures the
eﬃciency of the impellers [14]. Re can be increased up
to 5 106: the corresponding magnetic Reynolds number
is, Rm = Kµ0σR2Ω ≈ 49 (at 120 oC), where µ0 is the
magnetic permeability of vacuum and σ is the electrical
conductivity of sodium.

A ﬁrst modiﬁcation with respect to earlier VKS ex-
periments consists of surrounding the ﬂow by sodium at
rest in another concentric cylindrical vessel, 578 mm in
inner diameter. This has been shown to decrease the
dynamo threshold in kinematic computations based on
the mean ﬂow velocity [14]. The total volume of liquid
sodium is 150 l. A second geometrical modiﬁcation con-
sists of attaching an annulus of inner diameter 175 mm
and thickness 5 mm along the inner cylinder in the mid-
plane between the disks. Water experiments have shown
that its eﬀect on the mean ﬂow is to make the shear layer
sharper around the mid-plane.
In addition, it reduces
low frequency turbulent ﬂuctuations, thus the large scale
ﬂow time-averages faster toward the mean ﬂow. However,
rms velocity ﬂuctuations are almost unchanged (of order
40 − 50%), thus the ﬂow remains strongly turbulent [15].
It is expected that reducing the transverse motion of the
shear layer decreases the dynamo threshold for the follow-
ing reasons: (i) magnetic induction due to an externally
applied ﬁeld on a gallium ﬂow strongly varies because of
the large scale ﬂow excursions away from the time aver-
aged ﬂow [16], (ii) the addition of large scale noise to the
Taylor-Green mean ﬂow increases its dynamo threshold
[7], (iii) ﬂuctuating motion of eddies increase the dynamo
threshold of the Roberts ﬂow [17].

The above conﬁguration does not generate a magnetic
ﬁeld up to the maximum possible rotation frequency of
the disks (Ω/2π = 26 Hz). We thus made a last modiﬁca-
tion and replaced disks made of stainless steel by similar
iron disks. Using boundary conditions with a high per-
meability in order to change the dynamo threshold has
been already proposed [18]. It has been also shown that
in the case of a Ponomarenko or G. O. Roberts ﬂows,
the addition of an external wall of high permeability can
decrease the dynamo threshold [19]. Finally, recent kine-
matic simulations of the VKS mean ﬂow have shown that
diﬀerent ways of taking into account the sodium behind
the disks lead to an increase of the dynamo threshold
ranging from 12 % to 150 % [20]. We thought that using
iron disks could screen magnetic eﬀects in the bulk of
the ﬂow from the region behind the disks, although the
actual behavior may be more complex. This last modi-
ﬁcation generates a dynamo above Rm ≃ 30. The three
components of the ﬁeld ~B are measured with a 3D Hall
probe, located either in the mid-plane or 109 mm away

from it (P 1 or P 2 in Fig. 1). In both cases, the probe
is nearly ﬂush with the inner shell, thus ~B is measured
at the boundary of the turbulent ﬂow. Fig. 2 shows
the time recording of the three components of ~B when
Rm is increased from 19 to 40. The largest component,
By, is tangent to the cylinder at the measurement loca-
tion. It increases from a mean value comparable to the
Earth magnetic ﬁeld to roughly 40 G. The mean values
of the other components Bx and Bz also increase (not
visible on the ﬁgure because of ﬂuctuations). Both signs
of the components have been observed in diﬀerent runs,
depending on the sign of the residual magnetization of
the disks. All components display strong ﬂuctuations as
could be expected in ﬂows with Reynolds numbers larger
than 106.

FIG. 2: Time recording at P 1 of the components of the mag-
netic ﬁeld when the rotation frequency Ω/2π is increased as
displayed by the ramp below (Rm increases from 19 to 40).

Fig. 3a shows the mean values of the components hBii
of the magnetic ﬁeld and Fig. 3b their ﬂuctuations Bi rms
versus Rm. The ﬂuctuations are all in the same range (3
G to 8 G, at 30 % above threshold) although the corre-
sponding mean values are very diﬀerent. The time aver-
age of the square of the total magnetic ﬁeld, h ~B2i, is dis-
played in the inset of Fig. 3a. No hysteresis is observed.
Linear ﬁts of hByi or Bi rms displayed in Fig. 3 deﬁne a
critical magnetic Reynolds number Rc
m ∼ 31 whereas the
linear ﬁt of h ~B2i gives a larger value R0
m ∼ 35. The latter
is the one that should be considered in the case of a su-
percritical pitchfork bifurcation. The rounding observed
close to threshold could then be ascribed to the imper-
fection due to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld (Earth ﬁeld,
residual magnetization of the disks and other magnetic
perturbations of the set-up). The actual behavior may
be more complex because this bifurcation takes place on
a strongly turbulent ﬂow, a situation for which no rig-
orous theory exists. The inset of Fig. 3b shows that
rms = h( ~B − h ~Bi)2i is not proportional
the variance B2
to hB2i. Below the dynamo threshold, the eﬀect of in-

duction due to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld is observed.
Brms/hB2i1/2 ﬁrst behaves linearly at low Rm, but then
increases faster as Rm becomes closer to the bifurcation
threshold. We thus show that this seems to be a good
quantity to look at as a precursor of a dynamo regime.
In addition, we observe that it displays a discontinuity in
slope in the vicinity of Rc
m in an analogous way of some
response functions at phase transitions or bifurcations in
the presence of noise. Note however that the shape of
the curves depends on the measurement point and they
cannot be superimposed with a scaling factor as done for
hB2i versus Rm in the inset of Fig. 3a.

The above results are characteristic of bifurcations in
the presence of noise. As shown in much simpler ex-
periments, diﬀerent choices of an order parameter (mean
value of the amplitude of the unstable mode or its higher
moments, its most probable value, etc) can lead to qual-
itatively diﬀerent bifurcation diagrams [21]. This illus-
trates the ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the order pa-
rameter for bifurcations in the presence of ﬂuctuations
or noise.
In the present experiment, ﬂuctuations enter
both multiplicatively, because of the turbulent velocity,
and additively, due to the interaction of the velocity ﬁeld
with the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. Finally, we note that
both Rc
m are smaller than the thresholds com-
puted with kinematic dynamo codes taking into account
only the mean ﬂow, that are in the range Rc
m = 43 to 150
depending on diﬀerent boundary conditions on the disks
and on conﬁgurations of the ﬂow behind them [14, 20].

m and R0

The probability density functions (PDF) of the ﬂuctu-
ations of the three components of the induced magnetic
ﬁeld (not displayed) are roughly gaussian. The PDFs of
ﬂuctuations below threshold, i.e., due to the induction
resulting from the ambient magnetic ﬁeld, are similar to
the ones observed in the self-generating regime. We do
not observe any non gaussian behavior close to threshold
which would result from an on-oﬀ intermittency mecha-
nism [22]. Possible reasons are the low level of small fre-
quency velocity ﬂuctuations [23] or the imperfection of
the bifurcation that results from the ambient magnetic
ﬁeld [24].

Fig. 4 displays both the dimensional (see inset) and di-
mensionless mean square ﬁeld as a function of Rm. hB2i
is made dimensionless using a high Reynolds number
scaling [5]: hB2i ∝ ρ/(µ0(σR)2) (Rm − Rc
m, where
ρ is the ﬂuid density. We observe that data obtained at
diﬀerent working temperature are well collapsed by this
scaling (σ decreases by roughly 15 % from 100 to 160 oC).
The low Reynolds number or “weak ﬁeld” scaling could
also give a reasonable collapse of data obtained on this
temperature range but the predicted order of magnitude
for hB2i would be 105 too small.

m)/Rc

Dissipated power by Ohmic losses is another important
characterization of dynamo action. Our measurements
show that, 30 % above threshold, it leads to an excess
power consumption of 15 − 20 % with respect to a ﬂow

driving power of the order of 100 kW.

The eﬀect of iron disks deserves additional discussion.
A slight eﬀect of magnetization of iron has been observed:
the dynamo threshold during the ﬁrst run was about 20 %
larger than in the next runs for which all the measure-
ments were then perfectly reproducible. However, no ef-
fect of remanence that would lead to a hysteretic behavior
close to the bifurcation threshold has been observed. De-
magnetization of pure iron occurring for ﬁeld amplitudes
of the order of the Earth ﬁeld, i.e., much smaller than
the ﬁelds generated by the dynamo, the iron disks do not
impose any permanent magnetization but mostly change

the boundary condition for the magnetic ﬁeld generated
in the bulk of the ﬂow. This changes the dynamo thresh-
old and the near critical behavior for amplitudes below
the coercitive ﬁeld of pure iron. It should be also empha-
sized that the axisymmetry of the set-up cannot lead to
Herzenberg-type dynamos [25]. In addition, these rotor
dynamos display a sharp increase of the ﬁeld at thresh-
old and their saturation is mostly limited by the available
motor power [25]. On the contrary, we observe a contin-
uous bifurcation with a saturated magnetic ﬁeld in good
agreement with a scaling law derived for a ﬂuid dynamo.
The diﬀerent mechanisms at work, eﬀect of magnetic
boundary conditions, eﬀect of mean ﬂow with respect to
turbulent ﬂuctuations, etc, will obviously motivate fur-
ther studies of the VKS dynamo. A preliminary scan
of the parameter space has shown that when the disks
are rotated at diﬀerent frequencies, other dynamical dy-
namo regimes are observed including random inversions
of the ﬁeld polarity. Their detailed description together
with experiments on the relative eﬀect of the mean ﬂow
and the turbulent ﬂuctuations on these dynamics are cur-
rently in progress.

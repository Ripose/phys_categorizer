A rigorous method for introducing the variational principle describing relativistic ideal hydrody-
namic ﬂows with all possible types of breaks (including shocks) is presented in the framework of an
exact Clebsch type representation of the four-velocity ﬁeld as a bilinear combination of the scalar
ﬁelds. The boundary conditions for these ﬁelds on the breaks are found. We also discuss the local
invariants caused by the symmetries of the problem, including relabeling symmetry. In particular,
the generalization of the well-known nonrelativistic Ertel invariant is presented.

Introduction.

In the paper we discuss some problems related to the ideal relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD)
ﬂows in the framework of the special relativity. They are pertinent to description of the ﬂows with breaks in terms
of the canonical (Hamiltonian) variables based upon the corresponding variational principle, and introducing the
generalization of the Ertel invariant. These subjects are of interest both from the general point of view and are
very useful in solving the nonlinear problems, speciﬁcally, for the nonlinear stability investigation, description of the
turbulent ﬂows, etc. The necessity to consider the relativistic ﬂows is motivated by a wide area of applications to the
cosmological problems.

Variational principles for the ideal relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) ﬂows are widely discussed in the literature,
see, for instance, [1, 2, 3] and citations therein. As for the nonrelativistic ﬂows, the least action principle is conve-
nient to formulate in terms of the subsidiary ﬁelds and corresponding velocity representation known as the Clebsch
representation, see [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. These subsidiary ﬁelds can be introduced explicitly by means of the Weber
transformation, [11], see also [3, 5]. Alternatively, they naturally arise from the least action principle as Lagrange
multipliers for necessary constraints. Using these variables allows one to describe the dynamics in terms of canoni-
cal (Hamiltonian) variables. The nontrivial character of the Hamiltonian approach is due to the fact that the ﬂuid
dynamics corresponds to the degenerated case, see [12, 13].

In the papers [14, 15] it was shown that the hydrodynamic ﬂows with breaks (including shocks) can be described
in terms of such least action principle, which includes (as natural boundary conditions) the boundary conditions for
the subsidiary ﬁelds. In the nonrelativistic case the triplet of the subsidiary ﬁelds corresponds to the Lagrange labels
of the ﬂuid particles, say, µB, which are advected by the ﬂuid,

dtµB = 0,

dt ≡ ∂t + v · ∇, B = 1, 2, 3,

where v denotes three-velocity. These equations along with the entropy advection and the ﬂuid mass conservation
are assumed as constraints. Corresponding Lagrange multipliers, λB, θ and ϕ, along with µB enter the Clebsch type
velocity representation,

ρv = −ρ∇ϕ − λB∇µB − θ∇s,

where ρ and s denote ﬂuid density and the entropy per unit mass.

b. Variational principle. The relativistic least action principle can be formulated in a close analogy to the non-

relativistic one. Namely, introduce action A,

with the Lagrangian density

A =

Z

d4x L,

L = −ǫ(n, S) + GJ αQ,α ,
G = (1, νB, Θ), Q = (ϕ, µB, S), B = 1, 2, 3,

where νB, Θ, ϕ, µB represent subsidiary ﬁelds; n, S and ǫ(n, S) denote the particle’s number, entropy and energy
proper densities, J α = nuα is the particle current, and uα is the four-velocity, uα = u0(1, v/c), u0 = 1/
1 − v2/c2;

p

comma denotes partial derivatives. Small Greek indexes run from 0 to 3, and the Latin indexes run from 1 to
3; x0 = ct, r = (x1, x2, x3). The metric tensor, gαβ, corresponds to the ﬂat space-time in Cartesian coordinates,
gαβ = diag{−1, 1, 1, 1}. The four-velocity obeys normalization condition

uαuα = gαβuαuβ = −1.

Below we consider the four-velocity and the particle density n as dependent variables expressed in terms of the
particles current J α,

The ﬂuid energy obeys the second thermodynamic law

uα = J α/|J|, n = |J| =

−J αJα .

p

dǫ = nT dS + n−1wdn ≡ nT dS + W dn ,

where T is the temperature and w ≡ ǫ + p is the proper enthalpy density, p is the ﬂuid pressure, W = w/n.

The action in Eq. (3) depends (for a ﬁxed or inﬁnite volume) on the independent variables J α, Θ, and Q = (ϕ, µB, S),

A = A[J α, ϕ, µB , S, νB , Θ]. Its variation results in the following set of equations

δJ α :=⇒ W uα ≡ Vα = −GQ,α ,

δϕ :=⇒ J α

,α = 0,

δµB :=⇒ ∂α(J ανB) = 0,

or DνA = 0,

δνB :=⇒ DµB = 0,

δS :=⇒ ∂α(J αΘ),

or DΘ = −T,

δΘ :=⇒ DS = 0,
(13)
where D ≡ uα∂α. Eq. (8) gives us Clebsch type velocity representation, cf. Ref. [2]. Contracting it with uα results
in the dynamic equation for the scalar potential ϕ,

Dϕ = W.
(14)
Both triplets µB and νB represent the advected subsidiary ﬁelds and do not enter the internal energy. Therefore, it
is natural to treat one of them, say, µB as the ﬂow line labels.

Taking into account that the entropy and particles conservation are incorporated into the set of variational equations,
it is easy to make sure that the equations of motion for the subsidiary variables along with the velocity representation
reproduces the relativistic Euler equation. The latter corresponds to the orthogonal to the ﬂow lines projection of the
ﬂuid stress-energy-momentum T αβ conservation, cf. Ref.

[17, 18],

Note that the relativistic Euler equation can be written as

where the thermodynamic relation

∂T αβ
∂xβ ≡ T αβ

,β = 0,

T αβ = wuαuβ + pgαβ.

(Vα,β − Vβ,α)uβ = T S,α ,

dp = ndW − nT dS

is taken into account. Vector Vα, sometimes called Taub current, [16], plays an important role in relativistic ﬂuid
dynamics, especially in the description of circulation and vorticity. Note that W can be interpreted as an injection
energy (or chemical potential), cf., for instance [17], i.e., the energy per particle required to inject a small amount
of ﬂuid into a ﬂuid sample, keeping the sample volume and the entropy per particle S constant. Therefore, Vα is
identiﬁed with the four-momentum per particle of a small amount of ﬂuid to be injected in a larger sample of ﬂuid
without changing the total ﬂuid volume and the entropy per particle.

c. Boundary conditions.

In order to complete the variational approach for the ﬂows with breaks, it is necessary
to formulate the boundary conditions for the subsidiary variables which do not imply any restrictions on the physically
possible breaks (the shocks, tangential and contact breaks), are consistent with the corresponding dynamic equations
and thus are equivalent to the conventional boundary conditions, i.e., to continuity of the particle and energy-
momentum ﬂuxes intersecting the break surface R(xα) = 0, cf. Ref. [18],

{ ˘J} = 0,

˘J ≡ J αnα ,

{T αβnβ} = 0,

where nα denotes the unit normal vector to the break surface,

nα = Nα/N, Nα = R,α N =

NαN α ,

p

and braces denote jump, {X} ≡ X|R=+0 − X|R=−0.

Our aim is to obtain boundary conditions as natural boundary conditions for the variational principle.

In the
process of deriving the volume equations we have applied integration by parts to the term J αGδQ,α. Vanishing of the
corresponding surface term along with that resulting from the variation of the surface itself lead to the appropriate
boundary conditions after the variational principle has been speciﬁed.

Rewriting the (volume) action with the break surface being taken into account in the explicit form as

A =

Z

d4x

Xς=±1

Lς θ(ςR) ,

where θ stands for the step-function, we obtain the residual part of the (volume) action in the form

δA|res =

Z

d4x

Xς=±1

[ςLδD(R)δR + θ(ςR)∂α(J αGδQ)] .

Here δD denotes Dirac’s delta-function and we omit index ς labeling the quantities that correspond to the ﬂuid regions
divided by the interface R = 0; superscript ς ≷ 0 corresponds to the quantities in the regions R ≷ 0, respectively.
ς=±1 ∂α (θ(ςR)(uαGδQ)) vanishes
Integrating the second term by parts and supposing that the surface integral
due to vanishing of the variations δQ at inﬁnity, we arrive at the residual action expressed by the surface integral

to be independent) results in the following boundary conditions

which are equivalent to continuity of the momentum and energy ﬂuxes, cf. Eq. (20). Here we consider that the ‘on
shell’ value of the volume Lagrangian density, Leq, is equal to the pressure, Leq = −ǫ + nGDQ = −ǫ + w = p.

Now we can complete formulation of the variational principle appropriate both for continuous and discontinuous
ﬂows. The independent volume variables are indicated above, and independent variations of the surface variables are

sides of the break, {δϕ} = {δµB} = 0, and δS with {δS} 6= 0. Under these assumptions we arrive at the following
subset of the boundary conditions

e
Eqs. (26)–(28) reproduce the usual boundary conditions, and Eqs. (29), (30) are the boundary conditions for the
subsidiary variables. Other boundary conditions for the latter variables do not strictly follow from the variational
principle under discussion. But we can ﬁnd them from the corresponding volume equations of motion, providing, for
instance, that they are as continuous as possible.[22] The natural choice corresponds to continuity of their ﬂuxes,

{nαuαnµB} ≡ ˇJ{µB} = 0,

The set of the boundary conditions given by Eqs. (26)–(32) is complete and allows one to describe any type of breaks,
including shocks. For the latter case ˇJ 6= 0 and we arrive at continuity of the variables νB, µB, ϕ and zero boundary
value of Θ. For ˇJ = 0 the ﬂow lines do not intersect the break surface and we obtain very weak restrictions on the
boundary values of the subsidiary variables, cf. nonrelativistic case discussed in Refs. [14, 15]. Note that for the
speciﬁc case ˇJ = 0 (slide and contact discontinuities) we can simplify the variational principle assuming all both-side
variations of the subsidiary variables to be independent.

The above variational principle allows modiﬁcations. First, it is possible to exclude constraints, expressing the
four-velocity by means of representation (8). In this case the volume Lagrangian density can be chosen coinciding
with the ﬂuid pressure, cf. Ref. [2], where the continuous ﬂows are discussed in detail. Second, we can include into
[14, 15, 19, 20], where such surface terms
the action the surface term respective for the surface constraints, cf. Refs.
are discussed for ideal hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the nonrelativistic limit. This can be done for
the cases both with excluded and non excluded volume constraints.

Canonical variables. Starting with the action of Eq. (3) and Lagrangian density given by Eq. (4) we can
introduce the canonical (Hamiltonian) variables according to the general receipt. Namely, let Q represents the
canonical coordinates. Then

gives us conjugate momenta. Relations (33) cannot be solved for the generalized velocities Q,0 suggesting that we are
dealing with the degenerated (constraint) system, cf. Refs.
[3, 6, 12, 13]. But the constraints are of the ﬁrst type.
Thus, performing the Legendre transform with respect to Q we arrive at the Hamiltonian density

where we suppose that the four-velocity is given by representation (8). Making use of the deﬁnition (33) and of the
time component of the velocity representation, Eq. (8), we can transform the ﬁrst term in Eq. (34) as

P ≡

δA
δQ,0

= J 0G ≡ (πϕ , πµB , πS)

H = P Q,0 − p(W, S),

P Q,0 = J 0GQ,0 = −πϕV0 = πϕV 0.

Taking into account the normalization condition for the Taub current, VαV α = −W 2, we obtain

Consequently, we arrive at the following Hamiltonian density

V 0 =

W 2 + VaV a .

H ≡ H(P, Q, Q,a; W ) =

W 2 + VaV a πϕ − p(W, S).

The canonical equations following from this Hamiltonian reproduce in a 3 + 1 form the above dynamic equations for
the variables entering the Taub current representation. Variation of the action with respect to the chemical potential
W results in

πϕVa = −P Q,a.

n =

πϕ
1 + VaV a/W 2

.

p

Obviously, this relation is equivalent to Eq. (36), expressing the particle density n in terms of the variables entering
the Hamiltonian.

Underline, that the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (37) depends not only on the generalized coordinates ϕ, µB, S, their
spatial derivatives and conjugate momenta, but also on the chemical potential W as well. Evidently, we can consider
W as the additional generalized coordinate with zero conjugate momentum, πW = 0. This condition is consistent
with the dynamic equations due to the fact that ∂0πW = ∂H/∂W = 0, cf. Eq. (39).

Bearing in mind the ﬂows with breaks one can see that in the above discussed variant of the least action principle
we do not arrive at the additional surface variables except that deﬁning a break surface, R. But it enters the
action functional without derivatives. Therefore, corresponding conjugate momentum is zero-valued. Introducing the
Hamiltonian variables for the ﬂows with breaks we have to treat R as the surface function, deﬁning some (surface)
constraint. The latter is nothing else than continuity of the normal component of the ﬂuid momentum ﬂux, Eq. (26).

d. Poisson brackets. The Poisson brackets in the canonical variables are of a standard form. Symbolically,

{QA(x), PB(y)} = δA

B δ(x − y),

(40)

where δ(x − y) is spacetime Dirac’s delta, x and y are spacetime points, QA is shorthand notation for ϕ, µA and S,
and, analogously, PB denotes corresponding conjugate momenta, πϕ, πµB and πS.

e. Ertel invariant.

In addition to energy, momentum, and angular momentum conservation, for the ideal hy-
drodynamic ﬂows there are exist speciﬁc local conservation laws related to the dragged and frozen-in ﬁelds, and
corresponding topological invariants (vorticity, helicity, Ertel invariant, etc.), cf. Refs. [3, 5, 6, 10, 21] and citations
therein for the nonrelativistic case. They are caused by the relabeling symmetry. Discussion of these problems for
the relativistic ﬂows seems insuﬃcient, see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 16] and citations therein. Exploitation of the above descrip-
tion permits one considering these invariants to be simpliﬁed. For example, consider here generalization of the Ertel
invariant for the relativistic ﬂuids (to my best knowledge, this item was not discussed earlier). Deﬁning the Ertel
four-current,

E α = −

ǫαβµνωβµS,ν = −∗ωανS,ν ,

1
2

one can see that it is divergence-free, E α
,α = 0. Here ǫαβµν is Levi-Civita tensor, ωβµ is the (Khalatnikov) vorticity
tensor, ωβµ = Vµ,β − Vβ,µ, and ∗ωαν is its dual. Moreover, the Ertel four-vector E α is proportional to the particle
current J α,

in view of E α

,α = 0 resulting in E ≡ E 0/J 0 being dragged by the ﬂuid,

E α = EJ α,

DE = 0,

i.e. E is the scalar invariant of the motion. In the nonrelativistic limit it coincides with the Ertel invariant (curlv ·
∇s)/ρ, where ρ denotes the ﬂuid density.

f. Helicity current. The helicity invariant in the nonrelativistic case exists for the barotropic ﬂows and presents

pseudoscalar v · curlv. The strict analog for the relativistic case is the pseudovector

Strict calculations show that for the isentropic ﬂows the helicity current Z α is conserved, Z α

,α = 0.

For the general type ﬂows there exists generalization of the helicity current. Namely, consider reduced Taub vector,

g. Conclusion. We have shown that it is possible to describe the relativistic ideal ﬂuids with all physically
allowable breaks in terms of the least action principle both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian description. The
boundary conditions for the subsidiary variables entering the Clebsch type velocity representation are obtained in
two diﬀerent ways: one part follows from the variational principle as natural boundary conditions while the other one
was obtained from the dynamic equations under assumption relating to absence of the corresponding sources and the
maximal continuity compatible with the volume equations. Note that it is possible to change the variational principle
in such a way that all boundary conditions will result from it, i.e., they become natural boundary conditions. For this
purpose it is necessary to modify the variational principle by adding a surface term with corresponding constraints,
similarly to the nonrelativistic case (compare with the papers [14, 15] for the hydrodynamics and [19, 20] for the
magnetohydrodynamics). This variants are to be discussed in the forthcoming papers.

The approach discussed allowed us to give a simple treatment of the additional invariants of the motion, in particular,
to present generalization of the Ertel invariant for the relativistic ﬂows. This approach is suitable for the general
relativity and for the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics as well. Note that for the ﬂows without breaks the general
relativity case is discussed in detail in the paper [2]. The discontinuous ﬂows for the general relativity can be described
in analogy to the above discussion and will be published elsewhere.

entropy S as one of the ﬂow line markers. But if we are dealing with discontinuous ﬂows then it is necessary to distinguish
the Lagrange markers of the ﬂuid lines, µB
, and the entropy, S. Namely, the label of the particle intersecting a shock surface
evidently does not change, but the entropy does change. Thus, entropy can be chosen as one of the ﬂow line markers only
for the ﬂows without entropy breaks.

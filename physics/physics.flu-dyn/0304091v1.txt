Recent direct numerical simulations of the FENE-P model of non-Newtonian hydrodynamics
revealed that the phenomenon of drag reduction by polymer additives exists (albeit in reduced
form) also in homogeneous turbulence. We introduce here a simple shell model for homogeneous
viscoelastic ﬂows that recaptures the essential observations of the full simulations. The simplicity of
the shell model allows us to oﬀer a transparent explanation of the main observations. It is shown that
the mechanism for drag reduction operates mainly on the large scales. Understanding the mechanism
allows us to predict how the amount of drag reduction depends of the various parameters in the
model. The main conclusion is that drag reduction is not a universal phenomenon, it peaks in a
window of parameters like Reynolds number and the relaxation rate of the polymer.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of drag reduction by polymer addi-
tives is usually studied in channels or pipes, where the
boundary conditions and the eﬀects of the walls are very
important [1, 2, 3, 4]. Until recently it was not known
whether drag reduction can be achieved also in homoge-
neous ﬂows; this question has been answered recently in
the aﬃrmative, via Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)
of the FENE-P model equations [5, 6] in homogeneous
in a box with periodic boundary condi-
conditions (i.e.
tions) [7]. The FENE-P model takes the eﬀect of the
polymers on the Newtonian ﬂuid into account by intro-
ducing the conformation tensor R of the polymers into
the ﬂuid stress tensor. The FENE-P equations are known
to model well the eﬀects of polymers on the hydrody-
namic ﬂows, and DNS of these equations in channel ge-
ometry recaptured very well the characteristics of drag
reduction in experimental channel turbulence [4, 9]. The
observation of drag reduction in homogeneous conditions
oﬀers an opportunity to investigate the phenomenon in-
dependently of boundary layers and wall eﬀects. Never-
theless the FENE-P equations are relatively cumbersome
to analyze without the help of DNS. The aim of this paper
is to introduce a shell model of the homogeneous FENE-
P equations. We will demonstrate that the shell model
recaptures the main ﬁndings of the homogeneous DNS,
and that these ﬁndings are understandable analytically,
taking advantage of the relative simplicity of the shell
model. To derive the shell model for drag reduction we
make use of a formal analogy between the FENE-P equa-
tions for viscoelastic ﬂows and magneto-hydrodynamics
It had been pointed out that if we form
(MHD) [10].
a tensor Ri,j from the direct product of the magnetic
ﬁeld Bi, i.e. Ri,j ≡ BiBj, then the nonlinear couplings
of MHD lead to equations for the tensor R whose non-

linear terms are equivalent to those of FENE-P, up to
terms that remove the dynamo eﬀect. This analogy is
revisited and exploited in Sect. II. The shell model for
viscoelastic ﬂow is introduced and discussed in Sect. III.
In Sect. IV we present numerical simulations of the shell
model and demonstrate the existence of drag reduction.
In Sect. V we present the mechanism of drag reduction.
This is the central section of this paper. We show that
drag reduction is not a universal phenomenon. Rather,
it depends on the parameters, like the Reynolds number
and the relaxation time of the polymer. The amount of
drag reduction peaks in a window of these parameters. In
Sect. VI we demonstrate that understanding the mecha-
nism provides us with predictive power that we can test
against numerical simulations. We conclude in Sect. VII
by observing that precisely because drag reduction is not
a universal phenomenon it can be manipulated by opti-
mizing parameters.

II. THE FENE-P EQUATIONS AND THEIR
RELATION TO MHD

The addition of a dilute polymer to a Newtonian ﬂuid
gives rise to an extra stress tensor T (r, t) which aﬀects
the Navier-Stokes equations [5, 6]:

∂u
∂t

+ (u · ∇)u = −∇p + νs∇2u + ∇ · T ,

∇ · u = 0 .

(1)

Here u(r, t) is the solenoidal velocity ﬁeld, p(r, t) is the
pressure and νs is the viscosity of the neat ﬂuid. In the
FENE-P model the additional stress tensor T is deter-
mined by the “polymer conformation tensor” R accord-

ing to

Here 1 is the unit tensor, νp is a viscosity parameter, τ
is a relaxation time for the polymer conformation ten-
sor and ρ0 is a parameter which in the derivation of the
model stands for the rms extension of the polymers in
equilibrium. The function f (r, t) limits the growth of
the trace of R to a maximum value ρm:

(cid:3)

This model was simulated by DNS in channel ﬂow tur-
bulence, showing qualitative and quantitative agreement
with laboratory experiments on drag reduction. Recently
the same model has been used to understand whether
or not drag reduction is observed in homogeneous and
isotropic conditions [7].
In homogeneous and isotropic
turbulence, drag reduction can be determined by com-
puting the ratio

D =

ǫL
E3/2 ,

(5)

where E is the kinetic energy,ǫ is the total rate of energy
dissipation and L is the scale of the external forcing. The
above expression of drag reduction can be easily reduced
to the so called skin friction factor for turbulent chan-
nel ﬂows. The numerical simulation of homogeneous and
isotropic turbulence were performed in a cube with pe-
riodic boundary conditions. The external forcing was
applied with random phase in order to ensure isotropy
and homogeneity. The numerical simulations were per-
formed for the Navier-Stokes equations and the FENE-P
model for the same external forcing. Both the total en-
ergy dissipation and the kinetic energy increased for the
FENE-P as compared to the Newtonian case. A direct
computation of D shows that there is a drag reduction of
about 20%, i.e. roughly of the same order as what had
been observed in turbulent channel ﬂow. Also, in homo-
geneous and isotropic turbulence, the Taylor microscale
appeared to increase, apparently precisely as much as
the buﬀer layers increases in channel ﬂows [1]. This is
an interesting result because it tells us that the eﬀect of
boundary conditions is not crucial for drag reduction, at
least from a physical point of view. Nevertheless, it is
still diﬃcult to understand from numerical simulations,
even in the homogeneous and isotropic case, what is the
physical mechanism that is responsible for drag reduc-
tion. The increase of the Taylor microscale is certainly

2

not enough to explain quantitatively the increase of the
kinetic energy, as somehow previously suggested in the
literature [1, 11].

Having understood that the homogeneous simulations
exhibit drag reduction, we would like to propose a mecha-
nism for it. Rather than doing it directly with the FENE-
P model, we would present ﬁrst a simpliﬁed model. We
have already shown before that drag reduction appears
in simpliﬁed models like the Burgers equation [12]. Here
we derive a shell model for the FENE-P equations. The
advantage of the shell model is that it is much more
tractable analytically than the full FENE-P equations.
We will present the model, demonstrate explicitly that
it exhibits drag reduction in much the same way as the
FENE-P equations, and ﬁnally oﬀer a new mechanism to
understand the phenomenon.

III. THE SHELL MODEL

To derive a shell model of the homogeneous FENE-P
equations (without boundaries) we proceed in two steps.
First we recall a recent remark [10] that the FENE-P
equations can be recaptured almost entirely by taking
the conformation tensor to be a diadic direct product of
of a vector B, i.e Rij ≡ BiBj. In terms of this vector
the equations read

∂u
∂t

∂B
∂t

+ (u · ∇)u = −∇p + B · (∇B) + νs∇2u ,

∇ · u = 0 ,

+ (u · ∇)B = −
τ
∇ · B = 0 .

B

+ B · (∇u) ,

(6)

These equations are identical to the FENE-P model up
to the explicit appearance of the function f (r, t). The
learned reader of course recognizes that for τ → ∞ these
equations are isomorphous to magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD). We can therefore write immediately, by inspec-
tion, a shell model for FENE-P by using the well studied
shell model for MHD [13, 14], including the relaxation
term for ﬁnite τ . We denote the velocity ﬁeld by u,
and the “polymer ” ﬁeld by B. The dynamical variable
of the shell model are the ﬁeld at wave vector kn, de-
noted respectively as un ≡ u(kn) and Bn ≡ B(kn). The
shell model restricts attention to wavevectors kn = k0λn,
where typically in numerical simulations λ = 2.

In order to derive the shell model equation, we consider

the following non linear operator:

Φn(u, B) = b1knun+2B

n−1 +
n+1 − b1kn−1un+1B

(7)

where b1 = 1 − b; c1 = 1 + c; bc = b + c, and −1 ≤ b ≤ 0
and c = 1 + b are the usual parameters deﬁned in the
Sabra model.

In MHD one needs to worry about the existence of a
dynamo eﬀect, i.e. an unbounded increase in the mag-
netic ﬁeld. In our case the term that models the polymer
relaxation time −Bn/τ will be responsible for guarantee-
ing stationary statistics without dynamo. In addition to
the conservation laws the equations of motion remain in-
variant to the phase transformations un → un exp(iφn)
and Bn → Bn exp(iψn). The conditions are

φn + φn+1 − φn+2 = 0 ,
φn + ψn+1 − ψn+2 = 0 ,
ψn + φn+1 − ψn+2 = 0 ,
ψn + ψn+1 − φn+2 = 0 .

(13)
(14)
(15)
(16)

This implies ψn = φn ∀n. As a result of the phase con-
straints there exist in this model only few non-zero cor-
relation functions. The only second order quantities are
h|un|2i and h|Bn|2i. The only third order quanitites are
of the form ℑhβn−1βnβ∗

n+1i where β can be u or B.

IV. NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE
SHELL MODEL: DRAG REDUCTION

In this section we compare the solutions of the shell
model (10) to the usual Sabra shell model for the cor-
responding Newtonian ﬂow. The Sabra model (8) is ob-
tained from (10) in the limit τ → 0. Alternatively, we

can get the Sabra dynamics by simply taking as initial
conditions Bn = 0.

To have a meaningful comparison we always drive the
two models with a constant power input. In other words,
we choose

f1 =

f2 =

fn = 0 f or n ≥ 2 ,

(17)

with Fa = Fb = 10−3(2 + 2i). Since the power input is
the same, drag reduction is exhibited in (10) if the kinetic
energy of the ﬂow increases. The latter is simply hEui.
We will investigate the existence of drag reduction, its
dependence on parameters, the question of the dissipative
scale, and the dynamical signatures of drag reduction.

A. Drag reduction and its dependence on
parameters

We have numerically investigated the behaviour of the
SabraP model for diﬀerent values of τ and ν. In ﬁgures
(1)-(3) we show hEui for three values of the viscosity and
for diﬀerent values of τ . For concreteness we have ﬁxed
the model parameter b to be −0.4 in all the simulations.
In all the ﬁgures the constant line corresponds to the
value of the kinetic energy computed for the Sabra model
without coupling to Bn. By inspecting the three ﬁgures,
one can safely state that the SabraP model shows drag
reduction. In particular, for all cases, there is an optimal
choice of τ for which the eﬀect of drag reduction is max-
imal. For τ → 0 and τ → ∞ drag reduction decreases
and eventually we enter a region of parameters where we

the Sabra (dotted line with circles) and the SabraP (contin-
uous line with squares) models. Drag reduction is seen is the
relative increase in energy for small values of n on the expense
of large values of n.

B. Which scales are responsible for drag reduction?

To understand which scales are responsible for the
drag reduction, we compare h|un|2i for both models with
ν = 10−5, again at the same power input. This is shown
in Fig. 4. This ﬁgure teaches us an interesting and im-
portant lesson. It is clear that the drag reduction is due
to the relative increase in h|un|2i for small values of n,
and that this occurs on the expense of a relative decrease
in h|un|2i for high values of n. This ﬁnding is in close
correspondence with similar conclusions obtained for the
FENE-P model, both in homogeneous and channel ﬂows
[16].

In some theories of drag reduction it was proposed that
the dissipative scale is increased in the viscoelastic ﬂow,
and that somehow this is responsible for the phenomenon
[1, 11, 17]. To test this possibility we plot in Fig. 5 the
quantity hk2
n|un|2i as function of n. This quantity peaks
at the dissipative scale, i.e. the Kolmogorov scale. In-
specting ﬁgure (5) teaches us that the dissipative scale
has not changed at all between the Sabra and the SabraP
models, even though the latter certainly exhibits drag re-
duction. Thus, as indicated before, drag reduction should
be understood as a phenomenon of the energy containing
scales rather than the dissipative scales.

τ and decreasing values of ν, drag reduction decreases,
reaching a mere few per cents for ν = 10−8.

The similarity between the FENE-P and its shell ana-
log transcends statistical quantities. To observe the
close dynamical similarity it is instructive to consider the

which describes the exchange between the kinetic energy
Eu and the “polymer” or “elastic” energy EB. In ﬁgure
(6) we show a time series of Π for ν = 10−5. Π is always
negative; the eﬀect of the “polymers” is to drain energy
form the kinetic energy. Moreover the dynamics of Π is
strongly intermittent which is a feature already observed
in the DNS of the FENE-P model. The numerical simu-
lations indicate the conclusion that the model introduced
in this paper shows drag reduction in a way qualitatively
close to the observed behaviour of the FENE-P model
[9].

We note in passing that it is not the ﬁrst time that shell
models seem to reproduce many of the features of turbu-
lent ﬂows; it is gratifying however that we can present a
similar success even when we include relatively non triv-
ial eﬀects induced by polymer dynamics.

V. MECHANISM FOR DRAG REDUCTION

This is the central section of this paper, in which we
propose a detailed mechanism for drag reduction in the
present model. We begin by analyzing the necessary con-
ditions for drag reduction.

A. Necessary condition for drag reduction

To derive a necessary condition for drag reduction, let
us consider the equation for the total energy, which reads:

(20)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

All the terms on the RHS are strictly positive. Since
the energy input P is constant for the Sabra and the SP
models, we get

Σnk2

n [(unu

∗
n)S − (unu

∗
n)SP ] > 0.

(21)

On the other hand if the SP model is to be drag reducing,
we must have

Σn [(unu

∗
n)S − (unu

∗
n)SP ] < 0.

(22)

The only way (21) and (22) can hold simultaneously is
if for small kn, |un|SP > |un|S, and suﬃciently larger to
compensate for the fact that at large kn, |un|SP < |un|S.
This means that the kinetic energy plotted versus k has
to display an increased slope at least somewhere for drag
reduction to take place. We have seen this already in Fig.
4. We show this important phenomenon once more in a
log-log plot in Fig. 7, in which also the Bn-spectrum is
shown for future reference.We see very clearly the cross-
ing that occurs between the un spectrum of the SabraP
model and the Sabra counterpart, which is the necessary
condition for drag reduction. Note that the increase in
slope is a necessary but not a suﬃcient condition for drag
reduction. We may increase the slope but not enough to
cross the Sabra spectrum, or cross but not far enough to
compensate for the reduced kinetic energy at large k.

B. Typical scales related to the polymer

A discussion of the mechanism of drag reduction calls
for pointing out the existence of two typical scales that
were already introduced in the past in the literature on
drag reduction. The ﬁrst is the Lumley scale, kc, which

is deﬁned by the relaxation time of the polymer being
of the same order as the eddy turn over time. For our
model this scale satisﬁes

u(kc)kc ∼ τ

−1 .

(23)

Note that by deﬁnition this scale is Reynolds number
independent.

The other scale, that we refer to as the de Gennes scale
kg, is where the kinetic energy on the scale kg is of the
same order as the elastic energy:

u2(kg) ∼ B2(kg) .

(24)

In fact, in the SabraP model the scales so deﬁned appear
to be very close, if not identical to each other. In par-
ticular, we will show presently that also kg is Reynolds
number independent. To demonstrate the equivalence of
the two scales we ﬁrst exhibit in Fig. 8 the numerical es-
timate of kc. The physical signiﬁcance of kc is not in the
accidental identity of two time scales, but rather that for
k-vectors smaller than kc the eﬀect of the Bn ﬁeld on the
energy ﬂux is negligible, but not so for k-vectors larger
than kc. To see this introduce two quantities related to
the energy ﬂux in the SabraP model, namely:

Sn =
Tn =

Im(u

Im(B
(cid:10)

∗
∗
nun+1)
n−1u
∗
∗
nBn+1)
n−1u
(cid:11)

(25)

(26)

(cid:10)

The physical meaning of the two quantities is rather
clear: Sn describes the ﬂux of kinetic energy from large
scale to small scales due to non linear terms, while Tn
describes the ﬂux of kinetic energy to the polymer ﬁeld.

(cid:11)

We expect that for kn near kc, the eﬀect of Tn cannot be
neglected in the dynamics, i.e. the average energy ﬂux
for the velocity ﬁeld Gn = Sn − Tn begins to change with
respect to what it is observed in the Sabra model.

In ﬁgure (9) we show the quantity Gn computed for the
same model parameters of ﬁgure (8). The symbols refer
to the Sabra model while the continuous line corresponds
to the SabraP model. In the vicinity of nc ∼ 5.5 the two
models show a diﬀerent behaviour and in particular the
SabraP model shows a decrease of the total energy ﬂux
Gn as previously claimed.

Regarding the scale kg, it can be read from the spec-
trum shown in Fig. 7, in which ν = 10−6. In Fig. 10 we
show the analogous spectra for ν = 10−8. Clearly kg did
not change at all, in agreement with our assertion that it
is Reynolds independent. Finally, we note that in all the
ﬁgures shown kc and kg are of the same order of mag-
nitude, and in the sequel we do not distinguish between
the two.

C. The eﬀect of the polymer at large k-vectors

In this subsection and the next we discuss the eﬀect of
the Bn ﬁeld on the un ﬁeld for k-vectors much larger and
much smaller than kc. We will show that the spectrum
h|un|2i exhibits essentially the same scaling exponent as
the Sabra model, but the amplitude is aﬀected by the
presence of the Bn ﬁeld. This will be an important in-
gredient in the mechanism of drag reduction.

Begin with kn large, kn ≫ kc. In this regime the eﬀect
of the relaxation time τ on the dynamics of the Bn ﬁeld is

completely negligible. The dynamics of Bn is dominated
by its coupling to un, simply because unkn ≫ τ −1. But
then in this regime the dynamics is like the one of MHD
which had been analyzed in detail in [14]. The central
conclusion of that analysis is that up to intermittency
corrections, the spectra of both the Bn and the un ﬁelds
exhibit a scaling exponent ζ2 = 2/3. Indeed, inspecting
Fig. 10, we see that for large kn the two spectra have sim-

7

ilar slopes, although intermittency aﬀects the two spectra
in a diﬀerent way.

On the other hand, the amplitudes of the two spec-
tra need not be the same. The relative displacement of
the two power laws is determined by numerical details in
the model. To estimate this displacement we will esti-
mate the amplitudes of the two spectra at the dissipative
scale. The contribution to the dissipation of u is mainly
from the small scales, i.e. very large values of kn. We
can deﬁne an eﬀective scale kd the scale at which energy
dissipation peaks:

Σk2

nh|un|2i ∼ k2

dh|ud|2i

(27)

where ud = u(kd), and kd is of the order of the Kol-
mogorov scale. Since we found that the dissipative scale
hardly changes when we add the coupling to the Bn ﬁeld,
we can deduce from (20) that

h|ud|2iSP − h|ud|2iS ≈

(28)

h|Bn|2i
ντ

.

n
X

On the other hand, the sum on the RHS of Eq. (28) is
a geometric sum dominated by the contribution of B(kc)
where Bn is maximal. We thus estimate the relative dis-
placement of the two spectra at high values of kn by

h|ud|2iSP − h|ud|2iS ≈

h|B(kc)|2i
ντ

.

(29)

Thus to ﬁrst approximation we expect the slopes of the
two spectra to remain unchanged, maintained at a con-
stant diﬀerence from each other as given by (29), until kn
approaches kc from above, where the eﬀect of the relax-
ation time τ on the dynamics of Bn cannot be neglected.

D. The eﬀect of the polymer at small k-vectors

Next we discuss the slope of the un spectrum for kn ≪
kc. This is very easy, since the amplitude of Bn is very
small due to the very eﬃcient exponential damping by
τ . Thus the un ﬁeld hardly feels the coupling to Bn,
and its slope, up to intermittency corrections, is again of
the order of ζ2 = 2/3. Again, the amplitude is changed
compared to the pure Sabra case, and this is the most
important feature that is discussed next.

E. The tilt in the spectrum at kn ≈ kc

Considering the spectrum in Fig. 10 we note that the
Bn spectrum increases rapidly when kn → kc from the
left. To understand this phenomenon consider the equa-
tion of motion for Bn at steady state. To leading order

fact that |kn+1u∗

h|Bn|i ≪ h|Bn+2|i .

We continue this argument recursively to estimate the

(33)

When the amplitude of the polymer goes to zero (Bn →
0 ∀n) the only solution is the well known scaling law
Sn ∝ k−1
n . However the last term in (33) forces now a
tilt in the spectrum. Its sign is exactly such that Sn−1
has to increase compared to Sn and respectively Sn+1.
Of course, for kn ≪ kc the eﬀect of the Bn ﬁeld on the
u-spectrum is again negligible, and therefore the spectral
slope will settle back to the Sabra value. However if
the tilt in the vicinity of kc results in crossing the Sabra
spectrum we would have a whole spectral range where
the energy is higher.

We therefore conclude that the existence of drag re-
duction depends rather heavily on the sign of the energy
transfer at scales close to kc. To check the sign directly
in the numerics and thus to substantiate the existence of
the tilt we return to the equations of motion and write

1 (u, u, u) represents the kinetic energy

term Ψ(n)
3 (u, B, B) is the ﬂux of energy of the polymer
ﬁeld due to the transport of the velocity ﬁeld. Figure (11)
shows Ψ(n)
for τ = 0.4 and ν = 106, the
same parameters of ﬁgure (7). It is important to observe
that Ψ(n)
1 becomes positive for n > nc. For a given n the
term Ψ(n)
1 = Ln − Sn where Ln is
the amount of energy ﬂux given from the large scale to
scale kn and Sn is the amount of energy ﬂux given from
scale kn to smaller scales. It follows that when the energy
ﬂux is constant Ln = Sn and therefore Ψ(n)
1 (n) = 0. On
the other hand, a positive value of Ψ(n)
1 (n) implies that
Ln > Sn. This is exactly what is shown in ﬁgure (11).
The imbalance of the energy ﬂux Ψ(n)

F. Discussion

While we have been able so far to describe a convinc-
ing scenario for drag reduction, we still should explain
the mechanism for the increase of the large scale energy.
Since the ﬁeld Bn is negligible for small n, the average
energy ﬂux per unit time at small n must equal the in-
put work per unit time at the largest scales. However, the
energy ﬂux does show time and scale ﬂuctuations which
could behave diﬀerently for the Sabra and SabraP models.
More speciﬁcally let us consider the quantity Gn deﬁned
in Subsect. V B. As already discussed, Gn represents the
energy ﬂux at scale kn due to both the non linear terms
in the velocity ﬁeld and the non linear term in the Bn
ﬁeld. In terms of Gn, we can build a large scale energy
ﬂux WL = G2 +G3 +G4 which represents the full amount
of energy ﬂux across the largest scales, namely across k-
vectors kn < kc, for which the average energy ﬂux is
invariant to changing Sabra to SabraP. The deﬁnition of
WL is such that WL > 0 means an energy ﬂux from large
scales to small scales. In ﬁgure (12), we show the proba-
bility distribution of WL for both models, with numerical
parameters ν = 10−5 and τ = 0.4. The vertical line in the
ﬁgure indicates the average value, which, as expected is
invariant. As one can observe, the two probability distri-
butions show a substantial diﬀerence for negative values

of WL:
in the SabraP model one can have larger and
more frequent negative values of the energy ﬂux. This
can happen even if the instantaneous value of the total
energy per unit time obtained by the polymer ﬁeld from
the velocity ﬁeld is always positive! Qualitatively this
means that while the velocity ﬁeld is always forcing the
polymer ﬁeld, at very large scales the ﬂux can, from time
to time, be reversed, and the polymer ﬁeld forces there
the velocity. This is how the amplitude of the energy
spectrum is being increased on the average.

Clearly, this mechanism could not work unless the
“forcing” by the polymer ﬁeld acted in phase with the
growing kinetic energy. In order to clarify this further
we present two time-series of the kinetic energy and WL,
in Fig. (13) for the Sabra model, and in Fig. (14) for the
SabraP model. A close inspection of the ﬁgures shows
that the reverse of the energy ﬂux WL occurs exactly
during the growing phase of the kinetic energy, leading
therefore to a larger value of the instantaneous kinetic
energy. This in phase mechanism is responsible for drag
reduction. Note that this mechanism strongly depends
on the large scale dynamics and the value of kc. For kn
larger than kc no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the statistical
behaviour of the energy ﬂux is observed. However, the
amount of energy forcing, due to the polymer at large
scale, can depend on the Reynolds number, at least in
the SabraP model. If this is the case, then drag reduc-
tion should depend on the Reynolds number only through
the two relevant scales appearing in the systems, namely
kc and λT , the latter being the Taylor microscale

which also depends on τ in the SabraP model. Because
the drag is a dimensionless quantity, we argue that the
only way in which the Reynolds number may appear in
the drag reduction is by means of the dimensionless quan-
tity µ = kcλT (τ ).

There is a simple argument, proposed in the next sec-
tion, which explains why at large Reynolds numbers one
may observe the same qualitative mechanism, i.e. drag
reduction, with smaller eﬀects on the kinetic energy. As
a matter of fact, the numerical results show that drag

VI. PREDICTIONS OF THE THEORETICAL
MECHANISM

We summarize the mechanism of drag reduction using
the cartoon shown in Fig. 15. The tilt in the spectrum
occurs in the vicinity of kc, with the asymptotic slope for
kn ≪ kc and kn ≫ kc remaining essentially unchanged.
With such a spectrum the two inequalities (21) and (22)
are obviously obeyed.

The diﬀerence in the spectra for kn ≫ kc is deter-
mined predominantly by Eq. (28). This equation pre-
dicts that this diﬀerence will be greatly increased when
the Reynolds number is increased (i.e. when ν → 0), see
Fig. 16. Of course, if this happens we can lose the whole
eﬀect of drag reduction, since the amount of tilt at kc
is basically independent of ν. We need to maintain the
spectral diﬀerence small enough for the tilt to eﬀect a
crossing of the spectrum of SabraP and Sabra. Also the
position of kc is important. If we reduce kc (i.e. increase
τ ) the tilt is too far to the left and therefore it will fail
to increase the energy. In fact it can be drag enhancing.
The combined eﬀect of decreasing ν and increasing τ is
shown in Fig. 16. Needless to say, also if we decrease τ
too much we may lose drag reduction since the tilt will be
pushed to the irrelevant dissipative range where no en-
ergy containing modes exist. Also, if τ becomes too low,
Bn becomes smaller, and the amount of tilt is decreased,
as can be seen directly from Eq. (33). Although decreas-
ing the ﬁeld Bn brings the spectra closer together in the

FIG. 17: The relaxation time τ is to low.

large kn regime, the tilt may not suﬃce to reduce the
drag. Such a situation is shown schematically in Fig. 17.
Actually, using the language introduced in the previous
section and the above discussions, we are able to give an-
other argument to understand how drag reduction could
depend on the Reynolds number. As previously said, the
relevant dimensionless number in the system is µ = kcλT .
If τ → ∞ then kc → 0 and we know that drag reduction
must be inhibited.
It follows that for µ → 0 we can-
not observe drag reduction. For ﬁxed kc and increasing
Reynolds, λT (τ ) decreases as well, although not necessar-
ily as Re−1/2, where Re is the Reynolds number. Then,
for ﬁxed τ and increasing Reynolds number we should ob-

serve a decreasing eﬀect of drag reduction, as observed
in our numerical simulation. The same reasoning can be
applied to get information for small Reynolds numbers,
as the following argument shows. For τ → 0 we have
already shown that no drag reduction is possible simply
because kc → ∞. This is equivalent to say that when µ
becomes too large there cannot be any drag reduction. It
follows that for small Re, i.e. for large λT , drag reduction
disappears.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

In this paper we discussed several points concerning
the possible formulation of a theory for drag reduction
in turbulent ﬂow with dilute polymer. It is worthwhile,
therefore, to review the main points.

A) We have introduced a shell model resembling the
dynamical properties of the FENE-P equations. Beside
any theoretical considerations, the model shows drag re-
duction in a way close to what already observed in the
numerical simulations of the FENE-P model. The impli-
cations of this result is that one need not focus on bound-
ary eﬀects or dynamical properties of coherent structure
in order to capture the basic physics of drag reduction.
B) There exist a relevant scale in the system, kc deﬁned
by the so called ’time criterion’, i.e. u(kc)kc ∼ τ −1. In
the vicinity of this scale there is a tilt in the spectrum
which causes a crossing of the SabraP velocity spectrum
above the Sabra spectrum for kn < kc. This in its turn
means an increase in the kinetic energy at large scales.

11

Drag reduction can be physically understood in terms
of the energy exchanges between the velocity ﬁeld and
the polymer ﬁeld for kn ∼ kc. We have succeeded in
proposing a coherent picture, based on the equation of
motions, for the dynamics which is in close agreement
with the numerical results.

C) Drag reduction is a property of large scale ﬂow and
its dynamics. This implies that a quantitative descrip-
tion of drag reduction must depend on the details of the
ﬂow, the forcing mechanism as well as the Reynolds num-
bers. Although a general qualitative mechanism should
occur in all drag reduction ﬂow, the amount of the drag
reduction itself depends on how much energy is inter-
mittently given to large scale velocity. Thus large scale
ﬂuctuations are important for a quantitative theory.

D) Drag reduction by no means could be reduced to
the dynamics at the dissipation scale. Although drag
reduction could be Reynolds dependent, drag reduction
cannot be reduced to a simple increase of the dissipation
length. Actually, the dissipation scale does not seem to
be aﬀected by drag reduction.

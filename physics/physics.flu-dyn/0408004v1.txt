ABSTRACT: The arrangement of brine above water across a micro porous permeable membrane is
used to study high Rayleigh Number(1011 − 1010) high Schmidt number(650)turbulent convection. The
ﬂux shows 4/3rd scaling with line plume as the near wall coherent structures. Shifting of multiple large
scale ﬂow cells result in changing near membrane mean shear directions for large aspect ratios. Lower
aspect ratios show single large scale ﬂow cell and constant sense of mean shear.

INTRODUCTION

In Rayleigh - Benard convection , where buoyancy is the only source of motion, the non
dimensional heat ﬂux, Nusselts number (Nu) can be expressed as a function of the independent
non dimensional parameters viz. Rayleigh number (Ra) which expresses the ratio of buoyancy
forces to the dissipative eﬀects, Prandtl number (Pr), a ﬂuid property and Aspect Ratio (AR =
Length/Height), a geometric parameter. When Rayleigh number is high, turbulent convection
occurs with a well-mixed core and surface boundary layers. The classical 4/3rd law which states
that ﬂux ∼ ∆T 4/3 (ie.N u ∼ Ra1/3) is obtained from the assumption that transport process is
determined only by the near wall boundary layers and hence is independent of layer height h.
At the same time, as very high Ra implies negligible dissipative eﬀects, dimensional consistency
demands N u ∼ (RaP r)1/2 2 . The experimentally observed scaling law is N u = K Ran where
n is slightly less than 1/3, resulting in a weak dependence of ﬂux on layer height. At Ra > 108
the system is seen to generate a large-scale mean ﬂow which modiﬁes the near wall diﬀusive
boundary layers by shear eﬀects, and is expected to be the reason for the observed value of n .
Plumes play the major role in transporting heat in this regime from the boundary layer.13 Various
phenomenological explanations, each involving major assumptions, viz. a plume dominated mixing
zone,2 a turbulent shear boundary layer,10 a Blasius laminar boundary layer with dominant balance
of bulk and boundary layer dissipation6 etc seem to be able to obtain the observed scaling.

The Prandtl number dependence of Nu at high Pr is not clear. The only studies are that of
Goldstein5 using naphthalene mass transfer technique at Schmidt number of 2750 and of Askenazi
and Steinberg1 at Pr of 93. The Ra1/3 scaling was observed by Goldstein till Ra < 1013, while
Askenazi’s studies seem to support an exponent less than 1/3. At very high Pr, as the viscous
boundary layers reach their limiting thickness, it is expected that Nu becomes independent of Pr.7
In this case the ﬂux is expected to follow the 4/3 law as the strength of large scale ﬂow reduces with
increasing Prandtl Number. Hence, in adition to the large number of unresolved issues about the
nature of high Rayleigh number turbulent free convection, few studies exist for the high Prandtl

Number regime. Further, very little is known about the nature of near wall coherent structures in
this regime.

We study high Ra turbulent free convection driven by density diﬀerence across a thin perme-
able horizontal partition separating two tanks of square plan form cross sections. The gravitational
potential due to a heavier ﬂuid(brine) above a lighter ﬂuid(water) across the partition drives the
ﬂow, which is resisted by the presence of the micro porous partition. At low pore sizes in the
membrane, the transport across the partition would become diﬀusion dominated, while the trans-
port above and below the partition becomes similar to turbulent convection above ﬂat horizontal
surfaces. As molecular diﬀusivity (D) of NaCl is about 100 times lower than temperature diﬀusiv-
ity, larger values of Ra and Sc are achieved through this arrangement for similar driving density
potentials. The structure of convection in this case can easily be visualised.
In this paper we
report the ﬂux scaling and the nature of near wall coherent structures in high Rayleigh number
(∼ 109 to 1013) high Schmidt number( ∼ 650) turbulent convection.

2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND MEASUREMENTS

A schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. The test section,
made of 8mm ﬂoat glass, has two vertical compartments,with ground mating edges and a permeable
partition ﬁxed in between them. Figure 2 shows a (1000×) scanning electrode microscope (SEM)
image of Pall Gelmann TMNX29325 membrane disc ﬁlters used in the experiments. These are
bilayer membranes made of nylon66 with 0.45µ mean pore size and thickness of 142.24µ. The
solidity of the membrane was calculated as 0.6 from the SEM images by computing the occupied
fraction of pixels of a binary image generated from ﬁgure 2, based on a suitably chosen threshold.
The top tank is ﬁlled with brine after the bottom tank is ﬁlled distilled water. To reduce
initial mixing, a temporary tank with sponge bottom is kept over the membrane while the top
tank is ﬁlled, the removal of which initiates the experiment. A thin transparent plexiglass sheet
ﬂoating over the brine level prevents evaporation and produces similar boundary conditions for the
two compartments. The side glass compartments hold distilled water to reduce excessive refraction
of the laser beam during visualisation. The assembly is mounted on a levelling table so that the

2

partition can be made horizontal. Test section cross sections of 15 cms× 15cms, and 10cms ×
10cms with height 23 cms, ie aspect ratios of 0.652 and 0.435 were used.

The ﬂux is estimated from the transient measurement of the the top tank concentration.
Assuming that the ﬂuid in both the compartments is well mixed in the region away from the
partition, and using the mass balance at any time CT (t) VT + CB(t) VB = C0
B VB, with
CB

0 = 0, the concentration diﬀerence is

T VT + C0

∆C(t) = CT (t) − CB(t) = (1 +

Here, VT is the top tank solution volume, VB the bottom tank solution volume, CT (t) is the top
tank concentration, CB(t) is the bottom tank concentration and the superscript 0 denotes initial
values. The nett ﬂux of NaCl across the partition at any instant is given by the rate of change of
top tank concentration as

(1)

(2)

q = −h

d CT
dt

where h is the top compartment height. Hence, ∆C and ﬂux can be calculated from the transient
measurement of concentration of top tank ﬂuid.

The concentration of NaCl in the top tank is estimated from the measurement of electrolytic
conductivity of the top tank ﬂuid. The conductivity measurements are made by ORION SENSOR-
LINK TMPCM100 conductivity measurement system,9 with a 2 electrode conductivity cell, model
ORION TM011050, with automatic temperature compensation. The probe was calibrated before
each experiment. As calculation of dc
dt directly from the measured CT vs t distribution results in
excessive errors due to data noise an exponential decay ﬁt is used calculate the derivative dCT
dt .

The plume structure was visualised by Laser Induced ﬂuorescence of Sodium Flourescein dye.
The bottom tank solution was tagged with the dye and a horizontal laser sheet(Spectra-Physics,
Stabilite 2017TMAr-Ion,5W ) was passed just above the partition. The dye in the bottom solution,
while convecting upwards, ﬂuoresces on incidence of the laser beam to make the plume structure
visible. The quantity of dye (1.2ppm) was chosen to give suﬃcient ﬂuorescence intensity without
aﬀecting the measured conductivity. The ﬂuorescence images were captured on a digital camera
(SONY PCR 9E) after cutting oﬀ the laser light wave lengths using a yellow glass ﬁlter, Coherent
optics OG-515.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Flux

To compare the scaling of ﬂux with that of high Rayleigh number turbulent free convection,
the driving potential in the present case is corrected for the concentration drop occuring across the
partition, as shown in ﬁgure 3. This concentration drop is ∆cm = q lm/(Γ D) where Γ = open area
factor of the membrane, lm = the thickness of the membrane. Therefore, eﬀective concentration
diﬀerence on one side of the partition ∆cdc/2 = (∆c − ∆cm) /2. We look at the scaling of ﬂux
with (∆ρ/ρ)dc /2 = β∆Cdc/2 in the form of an alternate representation of ﬂux. Hereafter, the
subscript dc denotes this corrected eﬀective concentration diﬀerence.

Figure 4 shows the variation of ﬂux with the eﬀective driving potential obtained in the ex-
periments. The calculations were conducted after correcting the measured concentration curve
for systematic shifts due to change in probe linearity. The error bars, which include random and
systematic errors, for ﬂux and ∆C shown in the plot indicate the extent of possible variation.
The plot includes the results for experiments with a starting concentration of C0
T = 10g/l at
the two aspect ratios of 0.652 and 0.435, as well as experiments with starting concentration of
C0
T = 3g/l for AR=0.652. Therefore, within the present accuracy of the measurements, the ﬂux

the corresponding results of Goldstein5 and Xia.8

Theerthan12 have shown that a more appropriate representation of non dimensional ﬂux in
turbulent free convection is in terms of Ra
, where Raδ is the Rayleigh Number based on the
diﬀusion layer thickness, δd. The diﬀusion layer thickness for the current case is calculated as
can be written as a ratio of two ﬂuxes as,

Figure 5 shows the variation of Ra

is a near wall length scale for turbulent free convetion.11 This representation does not have the
layer height as a parameter and hence is a better representation in turbulent free convection where
near wall phenomena decides the ﬂux. Ra
varies only between 0.1 and 0.3 for a wide range of
Ra and various types of free convection, being a reﬂection of the fact that heat ﬂux in turbulent
free convection for a given ∆T and ﬂuid does not vary much. It could be noticed from (3) that

is a constant if ﬂux scales as ∆C4/3.

Numbers of 1011 − 1010 at Schmidt number of 650, the ﬂux scales very nearly as ∆C4/3, and the
eﬀect of Schmidt number on ﬂux is negligible. To get a better understanding of the phenomena,
we now study the near wall dynamics of coherent structures in the current experiments.

3.2 Coherent structures

Figure 6(a) shows the plan form plume structure, obtained when the upcoming plumes inter-
sect a horizontal laser sheet very near(<1mm ) the membrane. The image shows the full test section
= 4.6 × 10−3
cross setion of 15cm × 15cm (AR = 0.65) and is at Radc = 4.0711 × 1011 and
, where the ﬂux follows 4/3rd law (see ﬁgure 5). The ﬁgure shows that the near wall coherent
structures in high Rayleigh number convection are line plumes. We notice that the plume struc-
ture display circular patches of aligned lines originating from a plume free area in the center. The

∆ρ
ρ dc

aligned nature of the plume lines implies the presence of a near wall ﬂow along these lines. The
predominant motion of the ﬂuid in these patches, as observed from the video images, were outward
from the plume free circular area along the plume lines. The lateral shift of the plumes lines,due to
the entrainment velocity of the nearby line plumes, was also very low (∼1mm/s). Hence we infer
these cells as the signatures of large scale ﬂow cells. The large scale ﬂow impinges on the plume
free circular area in the center of each aligned plume region and create an outward near membrane
ﬂow which aligns the line plumes. The current image shows two large scale ﬂow cells on the right
side of the image. These large scale ﬂow cells shift their position randomly, implying that the large
scale ﬂow direction in high Ra convection, at least for higher AR, is not constant.

The above picture would be more clear from Figure 6(b) which shows the plume structure
in a vertical plane at 2cms from a side wall of the test section,( ie 2cms from the bottom of
ﬁgure 6(a)). Note that Figure 6(a) is after 11.5 minutes from ﬁgure 6(b), so that the latter
ﬁgure is not the exact vertical view of the former. The height of ﬁgure 6(b) is 6.7 cms. The
ﬁgure shows that plumes combine giving rise to columns of upward rising ﬂuid, which results in
a downward travelling portion of ﬂuid in between the columns, which impinges on the wall and
create the near wall shear. Figure 6(c) shows the near wall velocity ﬁeld vectors(overlaid over the
velocity magnitude) estimated using the spatial intensity correlation technique4 between ﬁgure 6(b)
and another image 0.4 seconds later. The upward moving colums and the resulting downward
impingement in between them could be noticed from the ﬁgure. The column rise velocity is about
0.3 cms/s while the downward velocites are much larger (∼ 0.8 cms/s). It is known that the large
. 3 W∗ for Figure 6(c)is 0.31
scale velocity scales as the Deardorﬀ’s velocity scale W∗ = (gβqh)
cms/s, of the same order as the plume rise velocity. Hence, one could infer that the large scale
ﬂow velocity is essentially driven by plume columns, which inturn organise the plume structure.
The current study shows that the mean shear near the walls could be larger than that due to W∗
as the downward velocities between the plume columns are higher than W∗ .

1/3

The planform plume structure at AR=0.435 is shown in ﬁgure 7(a). The image size is the
same as the test section cross section of 10cms × 10 cms. Figure 7(b) shows the vertical plume
structure 13 min prior to ﬁgure 7(a). The image shows a vertical section(normal to plume structure
in ﬁgure 7(a)) 2cms above the bottom side of ﬁgure 7(a) of 7.25cms width and 4.67 cms height
starting from the left of ﬁgure 7(a). The plan form plume structure and the vertical image lead
us to the inference that there is a single large scale ﬂow cell spanning the full tank cross section.
The large scale ﬂow impinges on the membrane on the right and creates a near membrane velocity
from right to left. This results in inclined plumes near the membrane as seen in the vertical image.
Plumes combine and rise along the left wall, feeding the mean circulation, which sustains the mean
shear near the membrane. The velocity estimates in ﬁgure 7(c) from spatial correlation between
images 0.4 seconds apart reproduces the dynamics reasonably well, with the plume column rise
velocity at the LHS of the ﬁgure(∼ 0.3cms/s) being of the same order as the large scale ﬂow velocity
estimated as the Deardorﬀ scale (0.31cms/s).

4. CONCLUSIONS

Experiments show that the ﬂux scaling in high Rayleigh Number -high Schmidt number
turbulent convection, even in the presence of a large scale ﬂow, follows the 4/3rdlaw and seems
to have little dependence on Sc. The ﬂux is only weakly dependent on the AR. The near wall
coherent structures are line plumes. We detect multiple large scale ﬂow cells and changing large
scale ﬂow direction at higher AR. Lower AR shows a single large scale ﬂow cell and constant sense
of near membrane mean shear. The large scale ﬂow is shown to be sustained by rising columns of
combined plumes, the velocity of which scales as Deardorﬀ scale.

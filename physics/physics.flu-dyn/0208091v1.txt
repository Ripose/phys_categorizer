The chemical reaction process in a T-shaped microchannel is studied experimentally through the
reaction of Ca2+ with a ﬂuorescent tracer, Calcium-green. For thin channels (10 µm), diﬀusion of
species is found to behave in a way independent of the thickness direction. In such a situation, sim-
ulations of a two-dimensional reaction-diﬀusion model agree remarkably well with the experimental
measurements. The comparison of experiments and simulations is used to measure the chemical
kinetic constant, which we ﬁnd to be k = 3.2 × 105 dm3/(mol s). Applications of the analysis to
faster reactions and to micro-titration are also discussed.

Measuring the kinetics of a chemical reaction in liquids
is usually done by ﬁrst mixing the ﬂuids rapidly then fol-
lowing the evolution of a signal, often ﬂuorescence linked
to the presence of a particular reactant. The shortest
times accessible by this technique are limited to a few mil-
liseconds by the time required for the mixing to occur.
Microsystems oﬀer the possibility of improving kinetic
measurements by considerably reducing the sample size,
providing a ﬁne temperature control, and allowing the
analysis of fast kinetics. Along these lines, a T-shaped
microreactor dedicated to the analysis of chemical reac-
tions was recently proposed.1 In such a system, two reac-
tant species are introduced through the two top branches
of the T and they react as they ﬂow side by side in the
exit channel (see Fig. 1). At typical Reynolds numbers
(usually Re < 1), diﬀusion is the only mechanism which
mixes the species to allow them to react together. The
diﬀusion however was found to be strongly inﬂuenced by
the top and bottom boundaries,1,2 which might lead to
anomalous measurements if this dependence is ignored.

We verify below that the boundary eﬀects on diﬀusion
can be circumvented by the use of very thin channels, as
proposed in Ref. [3]. This allows us to treat the problem
as a two-dimensional reaction-diﬀusion (r-d) problem to
which the equations are described and solved numerically.
We apply this analysis to measure the chemical kinetics
by comparing numerical solutions of the r-d problem with
experimental measurements for diﬀerent parameter val-
ues.

Theoretical background: Let us consider a second or-
der irreversible reaction taking place between two inﬁnite

planes, within a ﬂow driven at uniform velocity U. In the
stationary state, the reaction-diﬀusion problem can be
written as:

where Ci (i = 1, 2) is the concentration of the ith species,
Di is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and k is the chemical rate
constant. The initial concentrations of species 1 and 2
need to be taken into account (we assume C3,0 = 0),
thus yielding a six dimensional parameter space which
consists of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the three species,
their respective initial concentrations, and the reaction
rate constant.

The system of Eqs. 1 can be non-dimensionalized by

introducing a characteristic length scale4

and the two dimensionless parameters:

χ =

D1/D2, β = qC1,0/C2,0,

thus reducing the number of independent parameters to
three. The third diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D3, is taken to be
the same as the smaller of D1 and D2. This is justiﬁed
in the case of the binding between two molecules of very
diﬀerent sizes, if the size of the larger molecule does not
change.

The dimensionless downstream distance is deﬁned as
x∗ = xD/(ℓ2U ) where D = √D1D2, while the transverse
direction is non-dimensionalized with the characteristic
length y∗ = y/ℓ. Using this scheme, the dimensionless
equations become:

Note that the reaction rate has disappeared in Eqs. 4,
and that the number of parameters was reduced to two.
The chemical kinetic rate therefore only determines the
characteristic length scale.

Equations 4 were solved numerically for initial concen-
trations in the form of step functions. The solutions yield
a universal diagram of the concentrations Ci for diﬀerent
dimensionless positions downstream as a function of χ
and β (Fig. 2). The phase diagram is reﬂection invariant
around χ = β = 1.

A symmetric solution is found when β = χ = 1, while
all other solutions display some skewness as shown for ex-
ample by the shift of the position of the maximum. For
χ and β
= 1, the species in excess or the more mobile
species will diﬀuse further, causing the concentration of
C3 to be larger on the side of the less mobile/less con-
centrated species. The combination of large χ and large
β is an interesting limit, where the species in excess is

no diﬀusion of species 2; very quickly, a discontinuous
concentration proﬁle of the product (species 3) is set up
at the interface, and the only diﬀusion into the side of
species 1 is the diﬀusion of the product.

Observation of a two-dimensional regime in a non re-
acting system: Simple diﬀusion is observed in the micro-
channel by introducing a ﬂuorescein solution on one side
and distilled water on the other. The downstream be-
havior closely resembles the diﬀusion of a step function
concentration which gives rise to an error function solu-
tion of the form I

the error function, given by σ, is shown in Fig. 3 for
two diﬀerent channel depths (b = 10, 20 µm) and ﬂow
rates (Q = 0.03, 5 µL/min). In both cases, σ(x) follows
a power law. However, the exponent for the 20 µm deep
channel is 1/3, while it is 1/2 in the thinner one. The 1/3
exponent is due to the slower ﬂow velocity near the top
and bottom walls compared with the mean velocity, as
explained in Refs. [1,2]. For distances much larger than
the diﬀusion length (ℓD = U b2/D), the variations in the
thickness are smoothed by the diﬀusion in that direction
x1/2 scaling. Here,
so that we recover the expected σ
ℓD is reduced by using thin channels at low pumping
rates.

The validity of this interpretation was further tested
by measuring the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of ﬂuorescein in the
x1/2. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given
regime where σ
by5 σ = √4Dt = √4DU x. The value for the ﬂuorescein
10−6 cm2/s, which
salt was found to be Dﬂuo = 3.9
compares well with previously published values.3

orescent tracer Calcium-green (from Molecular Probes6)
using epiﬂuorescence microscopy.7 The binding process is
a fast reaction which signiﬁcantly increases the ﬂuores-
cence of the Calcium-green, thus allowing measurement
of the reaction intensity.

Finally, quantitative comparison can be made between
the theory and experiments by calculating the dimension-
less positions x∗ and y∗. This is done in Fig. 4, where
the normalized concentration of C3 is compared with the
normalized ﬂuorescence intensity for two values of β, at
diﬀerent downstream locations. The only free parame-
ter in these curves is the location of the “virtual” origin,
since we do not have a well deﬁned meeting point in the
experiments. However, once the origin is chosen, the nu-

merical solutions capture the shape and the downstream
evolution of the experimental data, such as the width,
the skewness, and the position of the maximum.

This analysis shows the applicability of the two-
dimensional reaction-diﬀusion model to the reactions in
a microchannel: By knowing the values of the experi-
mental parameters, we show that the numerical solutions
ﬁt the experiments well. Conversely, the model can be
used to determine, from experimental measurements, the
relative concentration of the reactants (micro-titration),
as well as the diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the chemical ki-
netics. The protocol to solve the inverse problem will
depend on the actual values of the parameters, since the

behavior can be simpliﬁed in some ways for diﬀerent pa-
rameter regimes. This problem will be addressed in a
future study.

Once the diﬀusion rates and concentrations are known,
we show a method of measuring the kinetic constant
which relies on the behavior downstream. This opens
the way to measuring reactions with larger k, since a
faster reaction would simply cause the reaction zone to
grow faster. Therefore, we see no a priori limit on the
largest k reachable in this system and faster reactions are
currently under study.

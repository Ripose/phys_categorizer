Abstract

We describe three apparatus, known as the large, medium, and small apparatus, used for high-

precision measurements of the Nusselt number N as a function of the Rayleigh number R for

cylindrical samples of ﬂuid and present results illustrating the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite conductivity

of the top and bottom plates on the heat transport in the ﬂuid. We used water samples at a
mean temperature of 40◦C (Prandtl number σ = 4.4). The samples in the large apparatus had

a diameter D of 49.69 cm and heights L ≃ 116.33, 74.42, 50.61, and 16.52 cm. For the medium

apparatus we had D = 24.81 cm, and L = 90.20 and 24.76 cm. The small apparatus contained a

sample with D = 9.21 cm, and L = 9.52 cm. For each aspect ratio Γ ≡ D/L the data covered a
range of a little over a decade of R. The maximum R ≃ 1 × 1012 with Nusselt numbers N ≃ 600

was reached for Γ = 0.43. Measurements were made with both Aluminum (conductivity λp = 161

W/m K) and Copper (λp = 391 W/m K) top and bottom plates of nominally identical size and

shape. For the large and medium apparatus the results with Aluminum plates fall below those

obtained with Copper plates, thus conﬁrming qualitatively the prediction by Verzicco that plates

of ﬁnite conductivity diminish the heat transport in the ﬂuid. The Nusselt number N∞ for plates

with inﬁnite conductivity was estimated by ﬁtting simultaneously Aluminum- and Copper-plate

data sets to an eﬀective powerlaw for N∞ multiplied by a correction factor f (X) = 1−exp[−(aX)b]

that depends on the ratio X of the thermal resistance of the ﬂuid to that of the plates as suggested

by Verzicco. Within their uncertainties the parameters a and b were independent of Γ for the large

apparatus and showed a small Γ-dependence for the medium apparatus. The correction was larger

for the large, smaller for the medium, and negligible for the small apparatus.

INTRODUCTION

The global heat transport by turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection (RBC) in a ﬂuid

heated from below usually is expressed in terms of the Nusselt number

where Q is the heat-current density, L the sample height, ∆T the applied temperature

diﬀerence, and λ the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid in the absence of convection. The

dependence of N on the Rayleigh number

N = QL/λ∆T

R = αg∆T L3/κν

(1)

(2)

(α is the isobaric thermal expension coeﬃcient, κ the thermal diﬀusivity, and ν the kinematic

viscosity) and the Prandtl number σ = ν/κ is a central prediction of various theoretical

models. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

One of the experimental problems in the measurement of N (R) is that the side wall often

carries a signiﬁcant part of the heat current. [7, 8, 9, 10] It is diﬃcult to correct for this eﬀect

because the temperature ﬁeld in the side wall is two-dimensional. Thus part of the applied

current will pass from the wall near its bottom into the ﬂuid and from the ﬂuid near its top

into the wall, thereby aﬀecting the ﬂuid ﬂow. This eﬀect can be minimized by using a ﬂuid

of relatively large conductivity conﬁned by side walls of relatively low conductivity. Water

conﬁned by Plexiglas or Lexan is a good choice from this point of view. However, a diﬀerent

experimental problem associated with ﬂuids of relatively large conductivity was pointed out

recently by Chaumat et al, and by Verzicco.

[11, 12] Using direct numerical simulation,

Verzicco showed that the top and bottom end plates of the convection sample, when they

have a ﬁnite conductivity, diminish the heat transport in the ﬂuid. This eﬀect increases as

the Nusselt number grows with increasing R and, unless understood quantitatively, severely

limits the largest R at which quantitative estimates of the idealized Nusselt number N∞(R)

in the presence of plates with inﬁnite conductivity can be obtained. Verzicco found that,

within his numerical resolution, the ratio f (X) of the measured Nusselt number N to N∞

depends only on the ratio X (see Eqs. 4 to 6 below) of the eﬀective thermal resistance of

the ﬂuid to the thermal resistance of the end plates. He derived an empirical form for f (X)

from his simulation. However, the numerical work was done using certain idealizations that

2

are not fully realized in a typical experiment, and it can not be expected that Verzicco’s

result for f (X), when used with experimental data for N , will yield quantitatively reliable

results for N∞.

We used one old and built two new apparatus suitable for high-precision heat-transport

measurements. The old one, to be called the small apparatus, was described before.[13] It

contained samples of aspect ratio near one with a diameter near 9 cm. The other two, called

the medium and large apparatus, will be described in detail in the next section. They were

similar to each other in design, except that the large (medium) one accommodated samples

of diameter D = 49.7 cm (D = 24.8 cm). We describe the large apparatus in detail in

this paper. Except for the length of the side wall, the medium one used identical vertical

dimensions, but had radial dimensions reduced appropriately.

Since the vertical structures of the end plates were nearly identical for the medium and

large apparatus, we expected the same correction factor f (X) to apply for the medium

and large apparatus. However, the measurements revealed that this is not the case. We

made measurements for several aspect ratios Γ ≡ D/L with two types of top and bottom

plates of nominally identical shape and size. One set of plates was made of copper with

a conductivity λCu = 391 W/m K and the other of aluminum with λAl = 161 W/m K.

The results indeed showed a lower eﬀective Nusselt number for the Aluminum plates, and

for a given Γ the diﬀerence increased with increasing Rayleigh number. As expected, our

data were not quantitatively consistent with the function f (X) obtained by Verzicco. Thus

we used the Copper- and Aluminum-plate data at a given Γ to derive an experimental

correction function that, when applied to both data sets, caused all points to fall onto a

single curve. In this analysis we retained Verzicco’s conclusion that the correction can be

expressed as a function of the ratio X of the thermal resistance of the ﬂuid to that of

the end plates. For the large apparatus we found that the correction function is, within

our resolution, independent of Γ; but for the medium apparatus the data yielded a small

Γ-dependence. Contrary to our expectations f (X) was closer to unity at a given X for

the medium apparatus than it was for the large one. This trend continued for the small

apparatus, which yielded the same results within our resolution with copper and aluminum

plates. For the medium and large apparatus we believe that the corrected results give the

true Nusselt number, unencumbered by side-wall or end-plate eﬀects, within a percent or so
for Rayleigh numbers up to R ≃ 1 × 1012. For the small apparatus a sidewall correction of

3

less than 2 percent was required.

Some of our results for N∞ already have been published elsewhere.[14, 15]

II. APPARATUS AND PERFORMANCE

A. Hardware

1. Large and Medium Apparatus

Here we describe in detail the large apparatus. For the medium one horizontal dimensions

are reduced by approximately 24 cm, and vertical dimensions are the same. A schematic

diagram is shown in Fig.1. From bottom to top, we ﬁnd ﬁrst a catchpan (A) capable of

containing up to 200 liters of ﬂuid in case of a leak. Supported above it is a 81 cm diameter

support plate (B) made of high-strength aluminum alloy. It stands on three legs [solid lines

between (A) and (B)] that consist of threaded 1.27 cm diameter steel rods screwed into

tapped holes in part (B). The entire apparatus could be leveled by adjusting these legs.

Part (C) was a bottom adiabatic shield made of aluminum. It was supported above part

(B) by a 50 cm diameter steel cylinder [vertical lines between (B) and (C)] with a height of

7.6 cm and a wall thickness of 0.32 cm. The central area of 49.5 cm diameter of the bottom

of (C) was covered uniformly by parallel straight grooves of 0.76 cm depth and 0.40 cm

width, interconnected by semicircles at their ends. Adjacent grooves were separated by 1.9

cm. Epoxied into the grooves was a heater made of AWG No. 15 Nichrome C resistance wire

surrounded by ﬁberglas sleeving. This heater had a total length of 10 m and a resistance of

6.8 Ω.[16] A second auxiliary heater with a 7 Ω resistance was wound around the outside of

the shield.

Suspended above the shield, on a steel cylinder of 3.8 cm height and 0.32 cm wall thick-

ness, was the bottom plate (D) of the sample. It was made in one case of high-strength

aluminum alloy, and in the other of oxygen-free high-conductivity copper. It had a thick-

ness of 3.5 cm. Its top surface was ﬁnely machined, with tool marks of depth less than 3 µm.

When aluminum was used, the plate was coated by the “Tufram” process [17]; the copper

plate was uncoated. The bottom surface contained the same type of Nichrome heater as

the bottom shield. Its diameter was 54.6 cm. A top central section had a reduced diame-

ter of 49.5 cm which was a close slide ﬁt into the plexiglas side wall cylinder (E). At one

4

point of the side of the section of reduced diameter there was a vertical 0.16 cm diameter

semi-circular groove through which the ﬂuid could enter the system. Five small holes were

drilled from below at an angle into the bottom plate to within 0.32 cm of its top surface,

and thermistors were mounted in these holes.

The inner diameters D of the plexiglas side walls (E) were measured at several angular

and axial positions, in several cases both before and after use. The standard deviation from

the mean of the measurements for a particular side wall generally was 0.03 cm or less. For the

large apparatus, where several side walls were used, the mean values of D were remarkably

constant from one aspect ratio to another, and all fell in the range 49.68 < D < 49.70

cm. For the medium apparatus we had D = 24.81 cm. We saw no statistically signiﬁcant

evidence of changes due to the exposure to water during the experimental runs. We estimate

that systematic errors from uncertainties in the cross sectional area were less than 0.1%. The

wall thickness was 0.63 cm for the large and 0.32 cm for the medium apparatus. The wall

lengths L were uniform around the circumference to ±0.01 cm and determined the aspect

ratio of the sample. Thus the uncertainty in the geometry due to uncertainties in L also was

less than 0.1%. In the present paper we report on measurements for L = 116.33, 74.42, 50.61,

and 16.52 cm, corresponding to Γ = 0.427, 0.667, 0.981, and 3.008, for the large apparatus.

For the medium one we used L = 90.20 cm and 24.76 cm, corresponding to Γ = 0.275 and

1.00. We deliberately did not use an aspect ratio close to 1/2 in an eﬀort to avoid the

multi-stability reported for this value on the basis of experiment [18] as well as of numerical

simulations [19].

The side wall extended 2.38 cm below the top surface of the bottom plate. An ethylene-

propylene O-ring sealed the system from the outside well below the top surface of the

bottom plate. A similar construction was used to terminate the side wall at the top. This

construction minimizes the heat ﬂow into the wall and provides a well deﬁned geometry for

simulations of this heat-ﬂow problem. [7]

The side wall was surrounded by an adiabatic side shield (F) made of aluminum. Epoxied

to the outside of this shield was a double spiral consisting of 15 m of aluminum tubing.

Water from a temperature-controlled circulator ﬂowed through the tubing. The shield was

suspended above the support plate (B) by six 1.9 cm diameter and 17.5 cm long plastic rods

(not shown in Fig. 1). During measurements its temperature was kept close to the mean

temperature of the system.

5

The top of the sample was provided by an aluminum or copper top plate (H) which

was similar to the bottom plate in its dimensions. The aluminum plate was also “Tufram”

plated. The top plate contained an outlet for the ﬂuid which was identical to the inlet in the

bottom plate, but in the sample assembly care was taken to locate the outlet at an angular

position opposite to the inlet. The top plate diﬀered from the bottom one in that it did not

contain a heater. Instead, it was cooled by temperature controlled water from a refrigerated

circulator.[20] It had a thickness of 3.34 cm, and a double-spiral water-cooling channel was
machined directly into it. The channel width and depth were 0.95 × 2.54 cm2. The spacing

between adjacent turns of the spiral was 2.54 cm.[21] The bottom of the groove came within

0.79 cm of the metal-ﬂuid interface. An additional plate was “O”-ring sealed to the top

plate from above to close the spiral channel. Small holes were drilled through the two-plate

composite from above to within 0.32 cm of the aluminum-ﬂuid interface, and calibrated

thermistors were mounted with their heads within 0.48 cm of the convecting ﬂuid. Each

thermistor was protected from circulating water by an additional small “O”-ring between

the two plates. To avoid convection of air in the vicinity of the sample, the entire space

outside the sample but inside the dashed rectangle K was ﬁlled with low-density (ﬁrmness

rating 1) polyurethane foam sheet.

The large apparatus was intended also for future work with compressed gases as the ﬂuid.

Thus, a retaining plate (I) and tension rods (G) were provided to sustain the force exerted

by pressures up to 10 bar. They were not in use during the measurements reported here.

The medium and large apparatus each contained 16 thermistors [22] that were calibrated

simultaneously in a separate apparatus against a laboratory standard based on a standard

platinum thermometer. Deviations of the data from the ﬁt were generally less than 0.002
◦C. In the top as well as the bottom plate one thermistor terminated at the plate center and

four were located equally spaced on a circle of 43 cm diameter. The remaining thermistors

were mounted on the adiabatic bottom shield, the adiabatic side shield, and the outside of

the plexiglas side wall. The power of the bottom-plate heater was determined by a four-lead

method.

The sample was leveled to better than 0.1◦.

In order to look for any inﬂuence of a

misalignment relative to gravity, a few data points were taken also with the sample tilted
by 2◦. No signiﬁcant eﬀect on N was noted.

6

2. Small Apparatus

The small apparatus had been used extensively for the study of pattern formation near

the onset of RBC, and was described in detail in Ref. [13]. The top plate was cooled from

above by circulating temperature-controlled water. The bottom plate was heated by a metal-

ﬁlm heater from below. The apparatus was used for the work reported in Refs. [7, 23, 24],
and there it contained a sample of acetone at a mean temperature of 32.00◦C (σ = 3.97). A

recent new set of measurements was made as well with this conﬁguration. The sample had a

0.318 cm thick sapphire top plate and a 0.635 cm thick Aluminum bottom plate. [7, 23, 24]

The transparent sapphire had the advantage of giving optical access. It had the disadvantage

that thermometers could not be mounted within it and that the top temperature had to be

determined with a thermometer immersed in the cooling bath. A small correction for the

series resistance of the sapphire and of a boundary layer above the sapphire in the water

bath was then required. [25] High-density polyethylene side walls compatible with acetone,

were used. They had a relatively high conductivity and the ﬂuid had a relatively small

conductivity. Thus a signiﬁcant wall correction, ranging from about 15% at small to about

8% at large R, was required [7] and introduced an uncertainty of several percent for the

ﬁnal corrected data. In recent measurements the sapphire top and aluminum bottom plates

were replaced with 0.635 cm thick Copper plates with thermometers mounted directly in

them, within 0.3 cm of the metal-ﬂuid interface. Corrections for the temperature diﬀerences

between the thermometers and the metal-ﬂuid interfaces were then quite small. As shown

in the Appendix, the results demonstrate that no Verzicco correction is required for the runs

with the sapphire top and aluminum bottom plates.

New measurements were made also in a diﬀerent conﬁguration, using water at 40◦C as

the ﬂuid. Here top and bottom aluminum or copper plates of identical dimensions were

used. The plates were 1.90 cm thick. Of this thickness, 0.63 cm protruded as an anvil into a

9.21 cm diameter Lexan side wall. The side wall was “O’-ring sealed to the plates at a point

beyond the metal-ﬂuid interface, well away from the bulk ﬂuid.The side wall had a thickness

of 0.32 cm. Only a small wall correction was required. First, a correction was made for the

conductance of the system with an evacuated sample cell. This correction was dominated by

a contribution due to the conductance from the bottom plate directly to a surrounding water

bath.[13] Based on model 2 of Ref. [7] we estimate that the actual non-linear correction for

7

the wall conduction was about 1.7% at R ≃ 3 × 107 where N ≃ 24 to 0.8% for R ≃ 109

where N ≃ 66. We found that the results with copper and aluminum plates agreed with

each other within their uncertainty, indicating that the Verzicco correction was not required

in the Rayleigh-number range and for the geometry of this apparatus. We believe that the

wall-corrected results are subject to systematic errors of less than one percent.

B. Procedure and Performance

This section is based on experience with the large apparatus. The performance of the

medium one was similar.

The measurements were made using de-ionized water. The water was degassed by cir-

culating it with a peristaltic pump for one or two days through a small stirred container
external to the sample at about 50◦C. After this procedure, visual inspection of the sample

showed complete absence of any bubbles. All data points are for a mean temperature close
to 40◦C where the Prandtl number σ is 4.38. The variation of σ over the applied tem-
perature diﬀerence can be estimated from (1/σ)(dσ/dT ) = 0.020K−1. At 40◦C water has
the following properties: density ρ = 992.2 kg/m3, isobaric thermal expansion coeﬃcient
α = 3.88 × 10−4 K−1, thermal conductivity λ = 0.630 W/m K, heat capacity per unit mass
at constant pressure CP = 4170 J/kg K, thermal diﬀusivity κ = 1.528 × 10−7 m2/s, and
kinematic viscosity ν = 6.69 × 10−7 m2/s.

The system was equilibrated with both top and bottom plates at 40◦C for over a day.

Thereafter the power needed to maintain the bottom-plate temperature was constant and

equal to 0.2 W. We do not know the origin of this parasitic heat loss, but subtracted it
from all subsequent measurements. It was about 0.8% (0.04%) of Q for ∆T = 1(10)◦C. A

possible dependence of this correction on the temperature of the bottom plate constitutes

one of the possible sources of error for the measurements with small ∆T .

We determined the conductance between the bottom plate and the bottom adiabatic
shield by changing the shield temperature with the bottom plate at 40◦C, and found it to be
about one W/◦C. Thus, the regulation of the shield temperature within better than 0.01◦C

of the bottom-plate temperature reduced heat exchange between the shield and the bottom

plate to a negligible value.

We measured the inﬂuence of the adiabatic side-shield temperature Ts on the heat current

8

necessary to maintain a constant temperature diﬀerence across the sample. We found this
current to decrease by 1.3 W when Ts was increased by 1◦C. The side shield was always kept
within about 0.1◦C of the mean sample temperature, and thus heat exchange with it was

not a signiﬁcant source of error except perhaps at the smallest values of ∆T where the heat

current through the sample was small.

In the remainder of this section we describe the performance of the system for Γ ≃ 1.

Similar behavior was found for other Γ values.

Data points were obtained by holding constant both the top and bottom plate tempera-

ture. For the bottom plate this was done by adjusting the heater power in a digital feedback

loop using the central thermometer (T0). For the top plate a constant temperature was

achieved by circulating temperature-controlled water [20] through the double spiral. The

heat current applied to the bottom plate and all ﬁve thermometers in each plate were mon-

itored for a minimum of 8 hours, frequently for one day, and on occasion for ten days under

nominally constant external conditions. Usually a constant current and constant temper-

atures were obtained after less than an hour. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we show

the apparent Nusselt number computed from the top- and bottom-plate temperatures and

the heat current during the transient after a change of the Rayleigh number from about
1 × 1010 to 8.4 × 1010. One sees that the transients had a relaxation time τN of about 300

sec, and died out within our resolution after only about half an hour. The relaxation time

was about the same for the Rayleigh number (i.e.

for ∆T ), and we believe it to be con-

trolled by the rate at which we can provide/remove the energy necessary to heat/cool the

bottom/top plate rather than by hydrodynamic transients. Nonetheless it is instructive to

compare the observed relaxation time with an estimate of an internal time constant of the

system. It is signiﬁcantly faster than a simple relaxation process involving the entire system
and an eﬀective vertical thermal diﬀusion time τN = L2/(π2N κ) ≃ 600s. This suggests

that the relatively thin boundary layers adjacent to the top and bottom plates equilibrate

quite quickly, and that the large-scale circulation is also established on a relatively short

time scale. Our experience indicates that the concerns expressed by Roche et al. [18] about

very long time constants for Nusselt-number measurements using water are unwarranted, at

least for the aspect ratios that we examined.

The currents and temperatures recorded after the ﬁrst several hours were time averaged.

The ﬁve averaged temperatures for each plate were averaged to give our best estimate of

9

the top and bottom plate temperatures. A correction to these temperatures was made for

the temperature change across the aluminum or copper layers between the ﬂuid and the

thermistor heads. For the aluminum plates this correction was estimated to be 0.8% (1.5%)
of ∆T for ∆T = 1(10)◦C; for the copper plates it was smaller by a factor of 2.4. The results
for Tt and Tb yielded the ﬁnal values of ¯T = (Tb + Tt)/2, and of the value of ∆T = Tb − Tt

use to compute N .

Recently it was appreciated that the heat ﬂux from (to) the bottom (top) plate occurs

preferentially near the circumference of the plate, with smaller ﬂuxes near the center. [26]

This will inevitably lead to horizontal thermal gradients in plates of ﬁnite conductivity. To

our knowledge no systematic measurements of such gradients have been made for actual

experimental conditions. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show the horizontal temperature diﬀerences

Ti − T0, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 between thermometers 1 to 4 near the plate periphery and thermometer

0 at the plate center, normalized by the applied vertical temperature diﬀerence ∆T . Here

Fig. 3 is for the Aluminum and Fig. 4 is for the Copper plates. In both cases (Ti − T0)/∆T

is at most of the order of a few percent. Surprisingly, the results for Copper (which has 2.5

times the conductivity of Aluminum) are not very diﬀerent in magnitude from the Aluminum

data. We note that in detail the results will depend on the nature and orientation of the

large-scale circulation which prevails in the sample. For the determination of the Nusselt

numbers we used the average of all the thermometers in a given plate. We would estimate

that this horizontal inhomogeneity of the temperature at the ﬂuid boundary could introduce

a systematic error of order 1 percent into the results for N .

III. EFFECT OF THE TOP- AND BOTTOM-PLATE CONDUCTIVITIES

A. Experimental evidence

In Fig. 5 we show the Γ = 1 results (large apparatus) for aluminum (copper) plates as

open squares (circles) on double logarithmic scales. Corresponding data were obtained in

the large apparatus for Γ = 3.00, 0.67, and 0.43, in the medium apparatus for Γ = 0.275 and

1.00, and in the small apparatus for Γ = 0.967. Also shown, as open triangles, are the data

for acetone (with Prandtl number σ = 4.0) from Ref. [23]. The acetone data were corrected

for the wall conduction using model 2 of Ref. [7] (see also Ref. [24]). Their range of R only

10

barely overlaps with that of the present data, but there is consistency. The solid line is the

prediction of the model by Grossmann and Lohse (GL). This model had been ﬁtted to data

that included the acetone results, and thus it ﬁts the acetone data quite well. The new data

with aluminum plates depart from the prediction more and more as R increases. The results

with copper plates agree well with the GL prediction. However, as we shall see below, to

some extent this agreement is illusory because the agreement will be spoiled somewhat by

a correction for the ﬁnite conductivity of the copper plates. In Sect. III B we show that the

diﬀerence between the experimental results obtained with copper and aluminum plates can

be understood in terms of the ﬁnite plate-conductivity as proposed by Verzicco. [12]

B. Verzicco Correction

Recently it was shown by Verzicco [12], by including the top and bottom plates in direct

numerical integrations of the Boussinesq equations, that a ﬁnite conductivity of the top

and/or bottom plates of a sample will diminish the heat transport by the ﬂuid. The physical

reason for this phenomenon is found in the signiﬁcance of “plumes” for the heat transport.

Much of the thermal energy that leaves the more or less quiescent boundary layer above

the bottom plate does so in the form of modestly sized relatively warm and thus buoyant

ﬂuid volumes that have become known as plumes. These plumes leave behind an enthalpy

deﬁciency that takes the form of a “cold spot” in the bottom plate. This cold spot, if it has

a ﬁnite lifetime, decreases the likelihood of further plume formation, and thus decreases the

heat ﬂux out of the bottom boundary layer. An analogous process occurs at the cold top

plate.

Verzicco carried out extensive numerical simulations for a system of aspect ratio Γ = 1/2,

with identical top and bottom plates and isothermal boundary conditions on the dry sides of

the plates. For that case he showed that the eﬀect of the plate conductivity on the measured

Nusselt number can be described in terms of a function f (X), with

N = f (X)N∞ .

(3)

where N∞ is the ideal Nusselt number in the presence of perfectly conducting rigid top and

bottom plates. The argument X is the ratio of the thermal resistance of the ﬂuid to that of

11

an end plate, i. e.

X = Rf /Rp

= X0/N ;

X0 ≡ λpL/(λf e)

(4)

(5)

(6)

with Rf and Rp equal to the resistances of the ﬂuid and of a plate respectively. Here λp and

λf are the end-plate and ﬂuid conductivities respectively, and e is the thickness of one plate.

Several of the conditions used in the simulations do not correspond to the experiment. The

actual bottom plate is closer to experiencing a constant heat ﬂux, the top plate is cooled in

its interior by water channels, and the plate geometries are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at the top

and bottom. Further, the experiments are not for the same Γ as the simulations. Thus we do

not expect the Verzicco prediction to be quantitatively applicable; but the diﬀerence between

the results with copper and aluminum plates shown in Fig. 5 is in the predicted direction

and of about the right size. Thus the measurements provide qualitative conﬁrmation of the

importance of the Verzicco eﬀect.

At large R the dependence of N on R can be written approximately as N = N0R1/3. We

note that in this approximation X is given by

λp(κν)1/3
λf eN0(αg)1/3
and is independent of the height and diameter of the sample. Thus, regardless of the aspect

∆T −1/3

X =

(7)

#

ratio and the overall dimensions, the correction is predicted to be nearly the same for the

same ∆T . Approximately, it should depend only on a constant combination of sample cell
and ﬂuid properties, and on ∆T −1/3. As we shall discuss below, we ﬁnd this not to be the

case. The correction for the large apparatus is signiﬁcantly larger than it is for the medium

one even though the top and bottom plates have the same vertical dimensions. For the small

apparatus (which did have a diﬀerent end-plate structure) no correction was needed.

From his numerical results Verzicco derived the emperical formula

f (X) = fV (X) = {1 − exp[−(X/4)1/3]}X/(X − 2)

(8)

for the case where the Nusselt number is determined from the temperatures at the ﬂuid-plate

interfaces (as is the case in the experiment). In Fig. 7 we show this function as a dashed

line.

12

C. Results for the large apparatus

To obtain an estimate of the size of the correction, we evaluated X as a function of R

for four aspect ratios using an average e ≃ 1.9 cm of the thickness of the bottom plate and

of the part of the top plate below the water cooling channels. Using this and the measured

Nusselt numbers, we obtained the values shown in Fig. 6 as solid and dashed lines for copper

and aluminum respectively for the large apparatus. Clearly the copper plates, having much

larger values of X, should yield results much closer to N∞ than the aluminum plates.

In Fig. 8a we present experimental results for N . We use the “compensated” form N /R0.3

in order to obtain suﬃcient resolution in the graph. We compare the uncorrected results

for N (open symbols) for Γ = 3.00 (left data set), Γ = 1.00 (middle data set) and Γ = 0.67

(right data set) with the estimates of N∞ based on Eq. 8 and the values of X given in

Fig. 6 (solid symbols). One sees that the functional form Eq. 8 does not lead to a collapse

of the data obtained with the copper and aluminum plates, indicating as expected that the

Verzicco function fV is not quantitatively applicable to the data.

In order to obtain a better estimate of N∞, we replaced fV (X) with the slightly diﬀerent

emperical function

f (X) = 1 − exp[−(aX)b] .

(9)

On the basis of the physical process envisioned by Verzicco (see Sect. III B) we feel that the

form of Eq. 9 is a better choice for two reasons. First it is a monotonically increasing function

of X, which it should be since we expect the correction to become smaller as X becomes

larger (N becomes smaller, see Eq. 5). This is so because we expect fewer plumes to be

emitted for smaller N . Second, f (X) is less than unity for all values of its argument which

it should be because the physical process envisioned can not enhance the heat transport by

the ﬂuid. We note that fV has a minimum at small X and is greater than unity both for

small and large X (of course we understand that it was meant to be used only over a limited

range of X where it was monotonically increasing and less than unity).

We simultaneously ﬁtted the aluminum- and copper-plate data for a given Γ to the

equation

N = N0Rγef f f (X) ,

(10)

i.e. over the experimental range of R for a given Γ (about one decade) we represented

N∞ by an eﬀective powerlaw with an eﬀective exponent γef f . The parameters N0, γef f ,

13

a, and b were least-squares adjusted. The results are listed in Table I. Typical statistical

errors for both a and b were near 0.02, but systematic errors due to small uncertainties in

the sample diameter and height made a similar contribution to their uncertainties. Thus,

within experimental error we found that f (X) is independent of Γ. We adopted the values

a = 0.275 and b = 0.39 for all Γ. The corresponding f (X) is shown as a solid line in Fig. 7.

We repeated the least-squares ﬁts, adjusting N0 and γef f . The resulting parameter values

are again given in Table I. Corresponding results for N and N∞ based on the copper- and

aluminum-plate data are shown in Fig. 8b. One sees that the results for N∞ (solid symbols)

for aluminum (squares) and copper (circles) plates within their scatter collapse onto a single

curve.

D. Results for the medium apparatus

Estimates of X for the medium apparatus are shown in Fig 6 as dash-dotted and dotted

lines for copper and aluminum plates respectively. They are seen to be comparable in size to
those for the large apparatus. Results of measured values of N /R0.3 for Γ = 1.00 and 0.275

are shown in Fig. 9 as open symbols, with the squares (circles) obtained with aluminum

(copper) plates. Again there is a diﬀerence that can be attributed to the diﬀerence in the

plate conductivity; but this diﬀerence is smaller than it was in the case of the large apparatus.

Again a ﬁt of Eq. 9 to the data yielded values of N∞ (solid symbols) that agreed for the

two types of plates. The coeﬃcients obtained from the ﬁts are given in Table I. They diﬀer

slightly, but signiﬁcantly, for the two aspect ratios. The corresponding functions f (X) are

shown in Fig. 7 as dash-dotted lines. These lines lie well above the solid one, reﬂecting the

fact that the correction for the medium apparatus is much smaller than it is for the large

apparatus.

E. Results for the small apparatus

Results of measured values of N /R0.3 for Γ = 0.967 obtained with the small apparatus
using water at 40◦C as the ﬂuid are shown in Fig. 10 as open symbols, with the squares

(circles) obtained with aluminum (copper) plates.

In this case we see that there is no

signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the plate conductivity on the results. Thus either set of data should

14

be a good representation of N∞.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we described a large, a medium, and a small apparatus for the measurement
of heat transport in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection. Over the range 108 ≤ R ≤ 1012

we studied the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite conductivity of the top and bottom conﬁning plates

by making measurements in each apparatus for samples with various aspect ratios. In each

case we used two sets of plates of nominally identical geometry, one made of copper with

relatively high conductivity and the other made of aluminum with lower conductivity. As

predicted by Verzicco, [12] we found for the large and medium apparatus that the Nusselt

number was diminished more when the plate conductivity was smaller, and that this eﬀect

could be represented by an empirical correction factor f (X) that is a function of the ratio X

of the thermal resistance of the plates to that of the ﬂuid (Eq. 3). For the large apparatus we

found that f (X) is, within our resolution, independent of the aspect ratio of the sample (see

Eq. 9 and Table I); for the medium apparatus there was a small aspect-ratio dependence.

Although both the medium and large apparatus required a plate correction to obtain the

conductivity N∞ for plates of inﬁnite conductivity, we found that this correction was smaller

for the medium apparatus. For the small apparatus the data indicate that no correction is

required.

One aspect of this phenomenon is worth noting.

In the R-range of interest N is ap-
proximately proportional to R1/3. In this approximation one can show (see Eq. 7) that, at
constant plate thickness e, the argument X of f (X) is proportional to ∆T −1/3 and inde-

pendent of the sample size and aspect ratio. Thus, to a good approximation the correction

for the ﬁnite plate-conductivity is expected to be equally important for measurements at

relatively small N and R, provided that the sample height is relatively small so that the

applied temperature diﬀerence ∆T is large. This is illustrated above by the data in Fig. 8

for various Γ (and thus L) but with the same diameter D and plate thickness e.

From the measurements for the large and medium sample we found that a change of the

overall size of the sample (i.e. of L and D in proportion to each other) at constant Γ and e

changes the correction f (X) considerably even though the argument X is about the same.

The dependence of f (X) on the physical size of the apparatus seems surprising. At this

15

point we can only speculate about a possible reason. One explanation might be found by
considering again the limit where (at constant ∆T ) N ∼ R1/3 ∼ L (see Eq. 2) and where

(see the previous paragraph) X is independent of L. In that limit we consider the size l P

of a “plume” that created a thermal “hole” of lateral extent lP in, say, the bottom plate.

We expect lP to be of the same order as the thermal boundary-layer thickness l ≃ L/2N

[1], which (at constant ∆T ) yields lP independent of L. Finally, we consider the time

τP = lP /v needed by the large-scale circulation (LSC) of speed v to traverse the thermal

hole. If this time is long compared to the thermal relaxation time of the hole in the bottom

plate (which should depend only on the plate properties), then the eﬀect of a previously

generated plume on further plume emission should be small. For v we have v ∝ Reν/L

where Re is the Reynolds number of the LSC. To a good approximation one expects [1, 4]
Re ∼ R4/9 ∼ L4/3, and thus τP ∼ L−1/3. We conclude that indeed τp is larger for a shorter

cell, thus suggesting a diminished Verzicco eﬀect. This argument could be aﬀected by an

R dependence of the plume density above (below) the bottom (top) plate; little is known

about this from experiment, but a recently proposed model [27] suggests that this density

is independent of R.

Another unexpected result is the noticeable, albeit small, Γ-dependence of f (X) for the

medium sample. Here we note that the LSC structure for the two aspect ratios most likely

is very diﬀerent. For Γ ≃ 1 we expect a single role ﬁlling the entire cell. For Γ ≃ 0.28 it

is likely that two or more rolls positioned vertically above each other prevail. One would

expect such a diﬀerence in the LSC geometry to inﬂuence the speed v of the LSC above

(below) the bottom (top) plates, leading to somewhat diﬀerent sizes of the Verzicco eﬀect.

The work presented here enables us to make reliable estimates of the theoretically relevant

Nusselt number N∞ of a system with inﬁnite thermal conductivity of the top and bottom

boundaries. Some of the results for N∞ have already been published elsewhere,[14, 15] and

we shall discuss the implications of the results for N∞ in further detail in a future publication.

Here we just note that N∞ diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the predictions of the Grossmann-Lohse

model [5] with the model parameters currently in use. This can be seen in Fig. 8 where the

model prediction is shown as a solid line. It will have to be determined whether the model

parameters can be adjusted so as to re-gain satisfactory agreement.

A second point to be noted is that the data in Figs. 8 and 9 allow at most a very small

dependence of N∞ on the aspect ratio Γ. We appreciate that this observation diﬀers from

16

prior measurements [23, 28] of N that were not corrected for the wall eﬀect [7, 8, 9, 10] or

the Verzicco end-plate eﬀect discussed in the present paper.

Finally, in an Appendix we re-examine previously published data and present new mea-

surements with acetone as the ﬂuid. We conclude that the older results had not been

inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by the ﬁnite plate-conductivity eﬀect.

VI. APPENDIX

Previous measurements, for a Prandtl number close to four, were reported in Refs. [23], [7],
and [24] where acetone with σ = 3.96 was used. Those data covered the range 108 ≤ R ≤ 1010

and were corrected for the inﬂuence of the side wall on the heat ﬂux, [7] but not for the

eﬀect of the end plates on the turbulent ﬂow (which had not been anticipated at that time).

Here we consider brieﬂy the end-plate eﬀect.

The sample cell had an inside diameter of 8.74 cm and a side wall of high-density poly-

ethylene (HDPE) of thickness 0.38 cm. However, the top and bottom of the side wall each

had a HDPE ﬂange of thickness 0.73 cm (including the side-wall thickness) and heigh 0.47

cm adjacent to the ﬂuid, thus making any estimate of the nonlinear side-wall correction [7]

quite uncertain. The sample cell consisted, from bottom to top, of an aluminum bottom

plate of thickness eAl = 0.635 cm (conductivity λAl = 161 W/m K), a sample of acetone of

height L = 8.70 cm (λf l = 0.159 W/m K), a sapphire top plate of thickness esapp = 0.317 cm

(λsapp = 37 W/m K), and a circulating water cooling bath. The bottom-plate temperature

was measured by thermistors imbedded in it about 0.2 cm from the ﬂuid-solid interface; a

correction for the temperature drop between the thermistors and the ﬂuid was negligible.

The temperature at the top was measured in the water coling bath. The temperature

diﬀerences were corrected for the temperature drop across the sapphire (which ranged from
1 percent near R = 108 to 3 percent near R = 1010), and for the temperature drop due to an

estimated thermal resistance Rb ≃ 0.009 K/W of a boundary layer in the water bath above

17

the sapphire (which ranged from 0.4 percent near R = 108 to 1.3 percent near R = 1010).
[25] A correction of 0.085 W/K (22 percent near R = 108 and 6.5 percent near R = 1010)

was measured with an evacuated sample cell and used to correct the heat current, but for

present purposes no further (non-linear) correction for the side-wall eﬀect [7] was made. The

results for the reduced Nusselt number are shown in Fig. 11 as open circles.

To conﬁrm the above results we made a new set of measurements after the sample had

been taken apart and then assembled again four years later, and obtained results represented

by the open squares in Fig. 11, in good agreement with the previous data.

One might attempt to correct for the top- and bottom-plate inﬂuence using Eqs. 3 and

Eq. 9 with the coeﬃcients given in Table I. The nature and geometry of the boundaries

in the acetone experiments were very diﬀerent from those of the copper and aluminum

plates used in the present work, and there is no reason why the results Eqs. 3 and Eq. 9

with the coeﬃcients in Table I should apply quantitatively. Nonetheless it is instructive to

examine the size of the predicted eﬀect. We estimated an average plate resistivity Rp =
(esapp/λsapp + eAl/λAl)/2 = 0.62 cm2K/W and computed X from Eqs. 4 to 6. This model
then predicts a modest correction to N (4 percent near R = 1010) at the largest R.

To obtain an experimental estimate of the plate eﬀect, we constructed a new sample cell.

The same HDPE side wall was used. The top and bottom plates were replaced by copper

plates of dimensions equal to those of the previous aluminum and sapphire plates. In this

case the top-plate temperature was measured with a thermistor imbedded in the top plate,

thus eliminating any series resistance in the water bath. An estimate similar to that of the

previous paragraph predicts that any plate correction should be completely negligible. The

results for N are shown in reduced form in Fig. 11 as solid circles. They agree well with the

measurements with the aluminum bottom and sapphire top plate. Thus we conclude that

the end-plate correction for the original acetone experiment was negligible.

[25] The total thermal resistance of the bottom plate of area 60 cm2, pressed against the sapphire

window with a very thin layer of glycerol in between, was measured to be 0.0286 K/W.

The bottom-plate and sapphire contributions were estimated to be 0.003 and 0.014 K/W

respectively. The glycerol layer was estimated to have a thickness of 5 µm, and in that case

would contribute about 0.003 K/W (if glycerol had not been used and air had been between the

plates, the air resistance would have dominated). This leaves about 0.009 K/W for the thermal

resistance in the water bath between the top of the sapphire plate and the thermometer. The

uncertainty of this result is quite large due mostly to the uncertainty of the thickness of the

glycerol layer. The original data of Ref. [7] were re-analyzed with this correction. The results

diﬀer slightly from those originally reported.

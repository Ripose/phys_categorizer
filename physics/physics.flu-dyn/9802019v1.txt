We discuss the generation and statistics of the density ﬂuctuations in highly compressible poly-
tropic turbulence, based on a simple model and one-dimensional numerical simulations. Observing
that density structures tend to form in a hierarchical manner, we assume that density ﬂuctuations
follow a random multiplicative process. When the polytropic exponent γ is equal to unity, the local
Mach number is independent of the density, and our assumption leads us to expect that the prob-
ability density function (PDF) of the density ﬁeld is a lognormal. This isothermal case is found to
be singular, with a dispersion σ2
, where
s ≡ ln ρ and ρ is the ﬂuid density. This leads to much higher ﬂuctuations than those due to shock
jump relations.

s which scales like the square turbulent Mach number ˜M 2

Extrapolating the model to the case γ 6= 1, we ﬁnd that, as the Mach number becomes large,
the density PDF is expected to asymptotically approach a power-law regime, at high densities when
γ < 1, and at low densities when γ > 1. This eﬀect can be traced back to the fact that the
pressure term in the momentum equation varies exponentially with s, thus opposing the growth of
ﬂuctuations on one side of the PDF, while being negligible on the other side. This also causes the
dispersion σ2
when γ 6= 1. In view of these results, we suggest that
Burgers ﬂow is a singular case not approached by the high- ˜M limit, with a PDF that develops power
laws on both sides.

I. INTRODUCTION

The formation of density structures by the velocity ﬁeld of highly compressible turbulence is of great interest in
astrophysics. The determination of their typical amplitude, size and volume ﬁlling factor poses signiﬁcant diﬃculties
since it requires a knowledge of the full statistics. As a ﬁrst step, we shall concentrate in this paper on one-point
statistics and more speciﬁcally on the probability density function (PDF) of the density ﬂuctuations in one-dimensional
(1D) turbulent ﬂows.

It is well known that the density jump in a shock depends directly on the cooling ability of the ﬂuid. Thus, for an
adiabatic ﬂow the maximum density jump is 4, for an isothermal ﬂow it is ∼ M 2
a [1], and for nearly isobaric ﬂows it
is ∼ eM
a [2], where Ma is the Mach number ahead of the shock. The net cooling ability of a ﬂow can be conveniently
parameterized by the polytropic exponent γ, so that the thermal pressure P is given by P = Kργ, where ρ is the ﬂuid
density [3]. Isothermal ﬂows have γ = 1, and isobaric ﬂows have γ = 0. Note that γ < 0 corresponds to the isobaric
mode of the thermal instability (see, e.g., [4]). Thus, in general, the amplitude of the turbulent density ﬂuctuations
will be a function of γ.

Previous work with isothermal ﬂows had suggested that the PDF is log-normal [5,6], while for Burgers ﬂows a
power-law PDF has been reported [7]. More recently, evidence that ﬂows with eﬀective polytropic indices 0 < γ < 1
also develop power-law tails at high densities has been presented [8]. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we present a
series of 1D numerical simulations of polytropic gas turbulence with random forcing, in which the polytropic exponent
γ parameterizes the compressibility of the ﬂow. We have chosen to use 1D simulations in order to perform a large
number of experiments at a suﬃciently high resolution, integrated over very long time intervals, allowing us to collect
large statistical samples.

The simulations have three governing parameters: the polytropic index γ, the Mach number M , and the Reynolds
number R. We keep the Reynolds number ﬁxed, and explore the eﬀects of varying γ and M on the resulting density
PDF. We ﬁnd that varying these two parameters is not equivalent. Variation of γ induces a clear qualitative variation
of the density PDF, which, at large Mach number, displays a power-law tail at high densities for 0 < γ < 1, becomes
log-normal at γ = 1, and develops a power-law tail at low densities for γ > 1. This suggests a symmetry about

1

the case γ = 1, which we also explore. Variation of the Mach number, on the other hand, only appears to induce a
quantitative change, in such a way that increasing M augments the width of the PDF.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In sec. II we describe the equations solved and the numerical method. In
sec. III we describe the statistics of the various ﬁelds, in terms of their PDFs, together with a tentative model and
a discussion of the Burgers case. Section IV is devoted to a discussion on the choice of the forcing, together with a
summary of our results.

II. EQUATIONS AND NUMERICAL METHOD

We choose to concentrate on one-dimensional forced polytropic gas dynamics, governed by the following non-

dimensionalized equations

where u is the velocity of the ﬂuid in units of U , ρ the density in units of ρ0, γ the polytropic index and M the Mach
number of the unit velocity U at the unit density ρ0. The equations are driven by an acceleration a with zero mean.
The Reynolds number is R = UL
ν , where L is the size of the domain and ν the kinematic viscosity chosen constant to
ensure the conservation of the mean velocity hui = 1
udx. The viscous term is kept as small as possible and is only
L
here to prevent numerical blow-up. Note that the “correct” form of the viscous term is obtained after replacing ν by
the ratio µ/ρ, where the dynamical viscosity µ is usually considered independent of the density. The equations then
conserve the momentum
ρudx if the acceleration a in eq. (1) is also replaced by the ratio of a force f to the density
ρ. The dynamics that results in this case is very diﬀerent due to the dependence of the driving term with respect to
the density, as discussed in the last Section.

For large Mach number simulations, it was found necessary to smooth density gradients, using a mass diﬀusion
term of the form µr∂xxρ in the right-hand side of eq. (2). Total mass is still conserved in the presence of this term,
and if µr is taken suﬃciently small, it has been tested that it does not aﬀect the dynamics in a way that could modify
our conclusions.

We also found it convenient to solve eqs. (1)-(2) using the variable s ≡ ln ρ. The numerical code uses a standard
pseudo-spectral method with periodic boundary conditions. Time advance is performed using a Crank-Nicholson
scheme for the linear terms and an Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear ones. For all the runs presented in this
paper, the kinematic viscosity has been ﬁxed to ν = 3 × 10−3. For runs with M ≥ 3, we have µr = 5 × 10−4.

The acceleration a is prescribed in Fourier space. Its spectrum has a constant amplitude (equal to 0.6) on wavenum-
bers 1 ≤ k ≤ 19 and phases chosen randomly with a correlation time tcor = 0.003. Resolution ranges from N = 3072
to N = 6144 grid points for the runs with M ≥ 6.

We perform one point statistics of the simulations, both for the density and the velocity derivative, keeping the

forcing and the viscosity constant. All simulations start with zero initial velocity and constant density.

In order to obtain reasonably sampled histograms of the one-dimensional ﬁelds, which contain only N spatial data
points, we sum the histograms over time, sampling at intervals of 0.1 time units, integrating over a total of 150 time
units. However, we have found that, since the simulations start with uniform density, the ﬁrst several samples must
be discarded, since they bias the density histogram near ρ = 1. We typically skip the ﬁrst 20 temporal samples (2
time units). The PDFs thus computed contain roughly 4 million data points. Note that longer integration times
are needed at larger Mach number in order to reach a statistically relevant sample, the sound crossing time of the
integration domain being larger as M increases.

Before describing our model for the density PDF, it is instructive to rewrite the governing equations in the inviscid,

unforced case, using the variable v = (1 − γ) ln ρ when γ 6= 1 and s = ln ρ when γ = 1. We get, for γ 6= 1

A number of interesting remarks can be made on the previous equations.
(i) When γ = 1, eqs. (5)-(6) are invariant upon the change s → s + b, where b is an arbitrary constant. Indeed, the

sound speed does not depend on the local density of the ﬂuid.

(ii) In the general case, if we substitute γ by 2 − γ and ρ by 1/ρ, we observe that the Riemann invariants z± =
u ± 2c
(γ−1) are exchanged, while their speeds u ± c remain unchanged. We shall now explore the implications of this
remark on the statistics of the density ﬂuctuations in the weakly compressible regime. For small values of the Mach
number, a reductive perturbation expansion can be performed on the viscous equations and it has been shown [9] (see
also [10]) that one-dimensional compressible turbulence reduces essentially to the superposition of the solutions of
two Burgers equations describing nonlinear wave propagation in opposite directions. More precisely (considering eqs.
(1-2) with M = 1), if we denote by ρ′ and u′ the perturbations of the basic state (ρ = 1, u = 0), Tokunaga obtained
( [9])

where ǫ is the order of magnitude of the nonlinear waves. The new coordinates ξi and τ are deﬁned by

where r1 = 1 and r2 = −1 and the phase functions obey

with θi arbitrary constants determined by the initial conditions. Finally the functions Fi (simply related to the
Riemann invariants z±) satisfy the Burgers equations

The ﬁelds Fi evolve almost independently, with the same dynamical equation, except for phase shifts, a higher order
eﬀect most important during collisions of shock waves. Given some initial conditions for ρ′ and u′, the substitution
ρ → 1/ρ (or ρ′ → −ρ′), and γ → 2 − γ leads to the replacement of F1 and F2 by F2(3 − γ)/(1 + γ) and F1(3 − γ)/(1 + γ)
respectively. For a vanishingly small viscosity ν, the rescaling of the amplitudes F1 and F2 can be absorbed in a
rescaling of the variables ξi. Except for this stretching of the space and time variables, this substitution will thus lead

to the same ﬂuctuations occurring at diﬀerent locations. As a consequence, we can expect that the probability density
functions of the cases γ and 2 − γ for small values of M will be closely related after the change ρ → 1/ρ. The case
of higher Mach numbers is more delicate due to the additional problem of mass conservation, rendering impossible a
symmetry between ρ and 1/ρ. This question is addressed below.

(iii) The substitution γ → 2 − γ can also be examined at the level of eqs. (3)-(4). Its eﬀect is simply to change the
sign of the right-hand sides. For γ < 1, eq. (4) shows that positive values of v (in this case associated with density
peaks) are mostly created by shocks (associated with negative velocity gradients). Looking at eq. (3), we see that
as v increases, the pressure term becomes exponentially small and thus cannot prevent the formation of very strong
peaks. Negative values of v (here associated with density voids) are created by expansion waves, but in that case
the pressure increases exponentially with decreasing values of v leading to a rapid saturation of this process. As a
consequence, we expect that for γ < 1 the PDF of v will be signiﬁcantly more populated at positive rather than at
negative values. For γ larger than unity the PDF of v will be similar, the formation of positive values of v (now
associated with density voids) being still unhindered by the pressure. It results that the PDF of s = ln ρ for γ > 1
will appear similar to that for γ < 1 after we change s → −s.

(iv) When γ = 1, the behavior is very diﬀerent since the acceleration due to the pressure term is simply proportional
to −∂xs and thus never becomes negligible. We expect a symmetry in the PDF of s, positive and negative values of
s being equally created, by shocks and expansion waves respectively.

(v) Finally, it is also useful to discuss the shock jump relations for the polytropic equations. Denoting by X the

ratio of the post-shock to the pre-shock density, we have (see [2])

X 1+γ − (1 + γm2)X + γm2 = 0

(16)

where m is the upstream Mach number in the reference frame of the shock. This equation shows that for γ = 1,
X = m2 and that the jump X increases more slowly than m2 for γ > 1, while it increases faster than m2 for γ < 1
with, as γ → 0, X ∼ em
1+γ . In this case, the shock velocity being
close to the sound speed, we can write m = 1 + u
2c , where u is the velocity in the simulation frame, leading to
X = 1 + ∆ρ

frame.

. For weak shocks, we get X ≈ 1 + (m2 − 1) 2

1+γ . We thus get ∆ρ

ρ = 1 + u

Note that typical pressure ﬂuctuations created by almost incompressible turbulence scale like ˜M 2 where the tur-
bulent Mach number is deﬁned as ˜M = urms/c (here urms is mostly made of solenoidal motions unlike in our 1D
simulations where it stands for purely compressible modes). This scaling corresponds to a balance between the pres-
sure gradient and the nonlinear term. If entropy ﬂuctuations are not allowed (like with a polytropic state law), the
resulting density ﬂuctuations also have to scale as ˜M 2. In thermally forced turbulence however, a Boussinesq-like
balance obtains between temperature and density ﬂuctuations, maintaining pressure ﬂuctuations of order ˜M 2, while
allowing for much larger values of density and temperature ﬂuctuations [11].

ρ ∼ ms

In weakly nonlinear acoustics, the pressure term is balanced by the velocity time derivative and we recover the

scaling δρ

ρ ∼ ˜M obtained for weak individual shocks.

B. The case γ = 1

The main idea of our model is that density ﬂuctuations are built up in a hierarchical process [5]. After a shock
(respectively an expansion wave) passes through a given region of mean density ρ0, the density reaches a new value
ρ1, larger (respectively smaller) than ρ0. In this region new ﬂuctuations can be created, changing the local value ρ1
to ρ2 and so on. Of course the dynamical equations constrain this process. For example, due to mass conservation,
arbitrarily high values of the density can only be reached in very localized and thin peaks. We thus expect this
hierarchical process to saturate at some value s+ > 0. A similar saturation should occur for low densities at some
value s− < 0, with probably |s−| > |s+|, due to the fact that larger voids can be created without violating the mass
conservation constraint.

The build up of these density ﬂuctuations is a random multiplicative process which, at the level of the variable s,
becomes additive. The random variable s is thus the sum of individual random variables (the density ﬂuctuations),
each having the same probability distribution. The latter fact follows from the invariance of the equations at γ = 1
under the change s → s + s0, which furthermore implies that each individual jump has the same average magnitude,
related to the Mach number of the ﬂow but independent of the local density. The sum of identical random processes is
known to have a Gaussian distribution, due to the Central Limit Theorem, whatever the distribution of the individual
processes. The PDF of s is thus expected to follow a normal distribution.

The variance of the random variable s can be estimated using the size of the typical ﬂuctuations associated both to
shocks and expansion waves. The case of shock waves has been discussed above. At small values of M , ρi+1/ρi ∼ 1+ ˜M

4

(with the Mach number ˜M = urms/c ) so that δs = ln(ρi+1/ρi) = ln(1 + δρ/ρ) ≈ ln(1 + ˜M ) ∼ ˜M . At high Mach
numbers, the individual jumps obey ∆s ∼ ln ˜M 2. For expansion waves, the balance of the time derivative of s and of
the positive velocity gradient in eq. (6), gives s ∼ M , regardless of the value of M since the term usx is smaller than
the term st if the density decreases uniformly in space (note that the decrease of ρ is exponential in time). Thus,
with this mechanism, the density decreases in the center of the expansion waves while it increases on the edges, until
pressure blocks the process. In the case γ = 1 pressure acts symmetrically in s and we thus get positive and negative
ﬂuctuations which are of the same order of magnitude, and much larger than those due to shocks. We thus expect
that σs ∼ ˜M for a large range of values of the Mach number.

From the previous dicussion we can expect the PDF of the variable s to be given by

The predictions of this model can be tested against results from numerical simulations. Figure 1 (top panel) shows
a plot of log(σs) vs. log( ˜M ) obtained by combining data from several simulations with M = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6 and 10.
These data were obtained by computing ˜M and σs for the accumulated density and velocity ﬁelds over 100 subsequent
outputs of the simulations (spanning a total duration of 10 time units) for each point in Fig. 1. This plot shows that
s ≈ β ˜M 2, with β ≈ 1, with a very good accuracy, up to the highest Mach numbers reached in our simulations.

On the other hand, we see in the bottom panel of the same ﬁgure, which displays log σρ vs. log ˜M , that the density

We now display in Fig. 3 the logarithm of the s-histograms for three runs with γ = 1 and M = 0.5, 2, and 6. Fits
with parabolas are shown in dashed lines and show that, to a very good approximation, the PDFs of the density are
in all three cases log-normals. An estimation of the widths and maxima of these distributions also shows a very good
agreement with the predictions σs ≈ M and so = −0.5σ2
s.

The distribution of the velocity derivative ux is shown in Fig. 4 for γ = 1 and M = 6. This distribution is found to
be almost independent of the Mach number. It presents a long exponential tail for negative values of ux and a strong
drop oﬀ for large values, analogous to the one found in the Burgers case [7].

C. The case γ 6= 1

The diﬀerence between the case γ = 1 and the cases γ 6= 1 lies in the behavior of the pressure term as a function
of the local density of the ﬂuid, an eﬀect which is most visible after comparing eq. (3) with eq. (5). With the
1−γ
2 s, the two equations identify, which only means that we expect
density-dependent rescaling M → M (s; γ) = M e
the small-ﬂuctuation behavior of the case γ 6= 1 to be identical to that of the case γ = 1 in regions where the local
logarithm of the density is close to s, when ˆM (s; γ) is substituted for M .

The argument at the origin of the PDF of s in the isothermal case is based on the fact that the local Mach number
of the ﬂow is independent of the local density. When γ 6= 1 this property is violated and there is no reason to expect
a log-normal PDF for the density. We nevertheless propose a heuristic model, reproducing most of the features of the
PDF’s obtained in our simulations, which consists in taking the same functional form of the PDF as in the isothermal
case, but replacing ˜M by ˆM (s; γ), where ˆM (s; γ) now stands for the “eﬀective” r.m.s. Mach number at the value
s. This “eﬀective” r.m.s. Mach number is deﬁned as ˜M (s; γ) = urms/c(s), the local turbulent Mach number, when
s− < s < s+, and by the constant ˜M (s+; γ) (respectively ˜M (s−; γ) ) for s > s+ (respectively s < s−). These cutoﬀs,
which, as we shall see, are necessary for convergence, are also physically meaningful, since the probability of new
ﬂuctuations arising within previous peaks or voids decreases as the amplitudes of the latter become larger because the
fraction of space they occupy decreases. The fact that the cutoﬀ occurs at larger values of |s| for s < 0 than for s > 0
is due to the larger ﬁlling factors of low density regions (see Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b for comparison). A numerical check
of this saturation property is possible if one computes the scatter plot of the standard deviation for s vs. the mean
value of s in subregions of the integration domain for each snapshot. Figure 6 shows these plots for M = 6, γ = 0.5
and γ = 1.5 in subregions of length N/3. A clear trend is visible, indicating the change of the local Mach number
with the local mean density. Moreover, we clearly see that the saturation level for s < 0 at γ = 1.5 occurs at a much

5

higher value of the Mach number than for s > 0, γ = 0.5. Plots of σs and σρ vs. ˜M for γ = 0.5 and γ = 1.5 are also
presented in Figs. 7 and 8. They show that σs increases more slowly than linearly with ˜M for high Mach numbers.
This results from the asymmetry in the ﬂuctuations of s for γ 6= 1. While for γ = 1 the typical excursions of s are
of the order of ˜M both for positive and negative values of s, when γ > 1 for example, pressure blocks the negative
ﬂuctuations of s while still allowing for ﬂuctuations of order ˜M on the positive side. The resulting variance σs is thus
expected to be smaller than ˜M . The same argument applies for γ > 1 but then ﬂuctuations are of smaller magnitude
when s > 0. Looking at the plot of σρ we see opposite trends for γ > 1 and γ < 1. First, note that we do not expect
the speciﬁc relation mentioned above between the variances of s and ρ, since the distribution of s is not Gaussian.
Second, this trend is easily interpreted if we recall that for γ < 1 the density ﬂuctuations are in high peaks, while for
γ > 1 they consists of large voids. In the former case the variance of ρ can increase greatly when M is large, while in
the latter case, the voids do not contribute much in the variance, leading to a slower increase of σρ with ˜M .

constraint of mass conservation stating that the mean value of the density should be 1 :
that in the absence of cutoﬀs, the convergence of the integrals would require α > 1 for γ < 1 and α < 0 for γ > 1. This
R
functional form of the PDF immediately allows to make a few predictions. For γ < 1, ˆM (s; γ) grows exponentially
with s for s− < s < s+ and as a consequence the PDF for 0 < s < ˆM (s; γ) is dominated by the power-law (in ρ)
behavior P (s; γ) ∼ e−α(γ)s, while the Gaussian-like decay will again dominate for s > ˆM (s; γ). For s < 0, the local
turbulent Mach number decreases as s decreases and we expect a drop oﬀ of the PDF more rapid than when γ = 1.
The behavior is exactly opposite when γ > 1. This prediction can be veriﬁed by looking at Fig. 9 displaying the PDF
of s for γ = 0.3 and γ = 1.7 at M = 3.

It is now interesting to relate the PDF for a certain value of γ to that obtained for 2 − γ. Writing the condition

For s− < s < s+, the functions ˆM (s; γ) and ˆM (−s; 2 − γ) are identical. If the cutoﬀs s+ and s− occur at large
enough values, i.e. when the local Mach number is either very large or very small, the contributions in the integrals
of the two terms involving these two quantities will be very close and, by inspection of eqs. (19) and (20) we get

α(2 − γ) = 1 − α(γ).

This relation is exact when γ = 1 since ˆM (s; 1) = ˜M is independent of s, allowing to recover the result α(1) = 1
2 .
Note also that for large enough M , a case where eq. (21) holds, the symmetry s → −s is not possible but must
include a translation in the s domain to account for mass conservation.

Relation (21) is veriﬁed numerically with a reasonable precision for the runs at the highest Mach numbers. For
example, when M = 6, the slope of the power law is −1.2 (i.e. α = 1.2) for γ = 0.5 while we have α = −0.28 for
γ = 1.5 (see Fig. 10). For smaller values of M , the absolute values of the slopes are closer to each other, a feature
due to the diﬀerent cutoﬀs for negative and positive values of s (see Fig. 9 for M = 3 and γ = 0.3 and 0.7). Note
that the shape of the PDF for M = 6, γ = 1.5 presents a steeper slope for values of s slightly smaller than that of
the maximum. This feature can also be reproduced with this simple model, as can be seen on Fig. 11 which displays
the PDF obtained from eq. (18) for α = 0.28, γ = 1.5, ˜M (0) = 1.2 and values of the cutoﬀs at ˜M = 10 for s < 0 and
˜M = 0.1 for s > 0.

D. The case γ = 0, i.e. Burgers’ equation

An interesting problem concerns the high Mach number limit. It is often suggested that when M is very large, the
dynamics of compressible ﬂows should be analogous to that prescribed by the Burgers equation. While this may be

6

true for the velocity ﬁeld, our results prove that it cannot be the case for the density. Indeed, we ﬁnd that whatever
the value of γ 6= 0 and of the Mach number, there is always a range of densities for which the pressure cannot be
neglected. For that range of densities the PDF has no power-law tail but presents a more rapid drop-oﬀ. For γ = 1,
it turns out that the pressure is never negligible. Extrapolating our results, we thus predict that for the Burgers’
case there should be power law tails both for low and high densities. We thus performed a simulation of the Burgers
equation (coupled with eq. (2) for the density) with the same parameters as for the previous runs and with N = 6144.
The resulting PDF is presented in Fig. 12. This plot shows that indeed the PDF is almost ﬂat for s < 0, while there
is also a power law for s > 0, with a negative slope of roughly 0.5. The cutoﬀ for large densities is due to the viscous
terms, which give a minimum scale for the width of the shocks, and thus a maximum value for the density peaks. In
the physical domain, we observe the creation of voids (s reaching a value of −85 at t = 64) which occupy most of
the domain, together with very high peaks (s ≈ 6.5). The number of peaks decreases during the simulation while the
density in the voids decreases exponentially in time. The forcing is unable to break the peaks because it acts at large
scales, while the the density ﬂuctuations become as narrow as allowed by viscosity. This PDF has to be contrasted
with the one obtained in [7], for which the Reynolds number was low and the simulation decaying. In that case the
power law at high densities was obtained but the PDF presents a sharp drop oﬀ for low densities. Two-dimensional
decaying simulations of the Burgers equation are also presented in [8] for moderate Reynolds numbers. The plateau
of the PDF at low values of the density is also obtained, while the power law for s > 0 is not as clear. Burgers
simulations for the decaying inﬁnite Reynolds number case are presented in [12]. In that case the PDF is calculated
for the cumulated mass function and not for the density, which is not deﬁned after the ﬁrst shock formation. A power
law is found, which extends to s = −∞ and connects to an exponential decay for s → +∞. Note that an exponential
PDF for the density was predicted in [13] on the basis of a model which treats shocks as completely inelastic particles.
We can thus conclude this section by saying that the Burgers case is truly a singular limit, which cannot be reached
as the high Mach number limit of a polytropic gas, with γ 6= 0.

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Eﬀects of the forcing

The study presented in this paper has been performed for a single choice of the forcing and of the Reynolds number.
While the variation with the latter parameter can be trivially extrapolated, we cannot a priori be sure that our results
are independent of the type of forcing. We have performed decay runs and observed that the behavior of σs vs. ˜M
is still the same as in the forced case. The PDFs however cannot be computed on a single snapshot due to the poor
statistics and cannot be integrated in time since the Mach number changes by roughly one or two orders of magnitude
during the run. We have also performed a run at γ = 1 with a forcing of the form f /ρ in eq. (1). In that case
the density PDF is not a lognormal anymore but presents a power law tail for low densities (not shown). This can
be attributed to the fact that the ﬂow is stirred more vigorously at low densities so that the eﬀective Mach number
indeed increases as ρ decreases. We nevertheless think that our results can be extrapolated to an unforced situation,
at a given time, and possibly also to the multi-dimensional case. Note that the Mach numbers we have explored in
this paper would correspond to even higher Mach numbers in the multi-dimensional case since in that case only a
fraction of the total kinetic energy populates the compressible modes.

We have presented an investigation of the density PDFs of a randomly accelerated polytropic gas for diﬀerent values
of the polytropic index and of the Mach number. We have suggested a simple model in which the density ﬁeld is
everywhere constructed by a random succession of jumps [5]. When the ﬂow is isothermal (γ = 1), the jumps are
independent of the initial density, and have always the same probability distribution. Expressed with the variable
s ≡ ln ρ the jumps are additive, and by the Central Limit Theorem are expected to have a Gaussian PDF, or a
lognormal in ρ.

An analysis of the expected s increments in the weak and strong shock cases, as well as those due to expansion
s should scale as the mean square turbulent Mach number ˜M 2. Moreover, because
waves, suggested that the variance σ2
of mass conservation, the peak of the distribution so is related to the variance by so = − 1
s . These predictions were
veriﬁed in 1D simulations of compressible turbulence. Previous claims that it is the density variance σ2
ρ that should
scale as ˜M 2 [6] might have been misled by lower eﬀective Mach numbers than those achieved in the present simulations,
in which all of the kinetic energy is in compressible modes thanks to the one-dimensionality.

B. Summary

7

When γ 6= 1, the density jumps are not independent of the local density anymore, and the shape of the PDF should
1−γ
2 s restores the
change. Observing that a renormalization of the Mach parameter (eq. (1)) M → M (s; γ) = M e
form of the equations for the case γ = 1, we proposed the ansatz that the PDF may still be described by the same
functional form as in the case γ = 1, but substituting M by M (s; γ). This prediction is conﬁrmed by the numerical
simulations, giving PDFs which are qualitatively in very good agreement with the model PDF, eq. (18). The result
is that the PDF asymptotically approaches a power law on the side where (γ − 1)s < 0, while it decays faster than
lognormally on the other side.

Upon the replacements γ → (2 − γ) and ρ → 1/ρ we ﬁnd, using the condition of mass conservation, that the slope
α of the power law for a given value of γ is related to its value at 2 − γ by eq. (21) in the large Mach number limit.
These results are also conﬁrmed by the numerical simulations, which exhibit a power law at s > 0 when γ < 1 and at
s < 0 when γ > 1, with slopes which are roughly related by eq. (21), with better accuracy at large Mach numbers.

Finally, on the basis of these results, we suggested that the Burgers case should develop a power law PDF at both
large and small densities, since in this case there is no pressure on either side. This result was again conﬁrmed by a
simulation of a Burgers ﬂow.

We shall conclude this paper by pointing out that the non-uniqueness of the inﬁnite Mach number limit might have
important consequences for astrophysical applications, such as in cosmology. The so-called Zeldovich [14] approxima-
tion is indeed based on the Burgers’ equation which, at the light of the present work, appears as a questionable model
of highly compressible ﬂows. This point will be addressed in future work.

PDFs have been respectively displaced in the plot by −2, −1, and 0 units in the vertical axis. The shift of the peak towards
more negative s values at larger M is real, due to the constraint of mass conservation. The dashed lines show the best ﬁt with

the shallow density minima. b) (Bottom) Density ﬁeld of a run with γ = 1.5 and M = 6 at t = 50.5. Note that the density
maxima are now much shorter, while the density minima (voids) become much deeper. They are also much wider than the

FIG. 6. Standard deviation of s vs. the mean value of s over subregions of size 1/3 of the integration domain for two runs
with (top) γ = 0.5 and (bottom) γ = 1.5. Note the inverse trends between the two runs and the saturation of σs at large values
of |hsi|, especially noticeable in the case γ = 1.5.

FIG. 7. Variance of s (top) and of ρ (bottom) vs. the mean square Mach number for 6 runs with γ = 0.5 and M = 0.5, 2, 3,

FIG. 9. PDFs of s for two simulations with M = 3 and γ = 0.3 (top) and γ = 1.7 (bottom). For γ = 0.3 the power-law

regime appears at large densities, while for γ = 1.7 it appears at small densities.

FIG. 10. PDFs of s for two simulations with M = 6 and γ = 0.5 (top) and γ = 1.5 (bottom). Note that at this Mach
number, the power-law regime for the γ = 1.5 case appears removed from the peak of the distribution, mediated by a regime
with a steeper slope.

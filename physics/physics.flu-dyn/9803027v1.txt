Abstract

We study low-speed ﬂows of a highly compressible, single-phase ﬂuid in the pres-
ence of gravity, for example in a regime appropriate for modeling recent space-shuttle
experiments on ﬂuids near the liquid-vapor critical point. In the equations of motion,
we include forces due to capillary stresses that arise from a contribution made by strong
density gradients to the free energy. We derive formally simpliﬁed sets of equations in
a low-speed limit analogous to the zero Mach number limit in combustion theory.

When viscosity is neglected and gravity is weak, the simpliﬁed system includes:
a hyperbolic equation for velocity, a parabolic equation for temperature, an elliptic
equation related to volume expansion, an integro-diﬀerential equation for mean pres-
sure, and an algebraic equation (the equation of state). Solutions are determined by
initial values for the mean pressure, the temperature ﬁeld, and the divergence-free part
of the velocity ﬁeld. To model multidimensional ﬂows with strong gravity, we oﬀer
an alternative to the anelastic approximation, one which admits stratiﬁed ﬂuids in
thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as gravity waves but not acoustic waves.

1 Introduction

Near the liquid-vapor critical point, many of the thermophysical properties of a ﬂuid exhibit
a singular behavior. For instance, the isothermal compressibility and the isobaric thermal
expansion coeﬃcients, as well as the isobaric speciﬁc heat, all diverge strongly at the critical
point. Critical enhancement eﬀects are also encountered in the behavior of the thermal
conductivity and the viscosity in the vicinity of the critical point, while the thermal diﬀusivity
approaches zero. These singularities play a major role in the thermal equilibration of near-
critical ﬂuids.

Understanding the eﬀect of singular ﬂuid properties on dynamics is not always straight-
forward. For example, it has been shown that even though thermal diﬀusivity is small,
temperature changes in a near-critical ﬂuid can occur rapidly via a mechanism which causes
adiabatic pressure changes in the bulk of the ﬂuid [24, 25]. This adiabatic mechanism cre-
ates a strong coupling between temperature changes occurring at the ﬂuid boundaries and
the temperature response in the interior of the ﬂuid. It works as follows. A temperature
perturbation applied at the boundary of a ﬂuid causes an expansion in the ﬂuid near the
boundary. Through the medium of sound waves, this produces an adiabatic pressure change
in the interior of the ﬂuid, and a consequent change in the temperature, much more rapidly
than could be accomplished by thermal diﬀusion acting alone. Near the critical point, where
the ﬂuid becomes highly expandable and compressible, the adiabatic mechanism dominates
the early thermal response and creates a ‘critical speeding-up’ phenomenon. This critical
speeding-up has been observed in earth-bound and low-gravity experiments [4, 6].

In contrast to the short time-scale of the thermal response, experimenters have observed
a much longer time-scale for the equilibration of density variations [36, 15]. Near the critical
point, the divergence of the compressibility and the inﬂuence of gravity can create strong
macroscopic density gradients (upon which microscopic density ﬂuctuations are superim-
posed). Although early adiabatic processes act rapidly (within seconds) to accomplish most
of the temperature changes, most of the relaxation of the density distribution to a new equi-
librium state is a non-adiabatic process driven by the much slower (hours-long) process of
heat diﬀusion.

Recently, Boukari, Pego, and Gammon [5] studied the combined eﬀects of the adiabatic
mechanism and earth’s gravity on the equilibration process in near-critical xenon, using a
system of equations which includes not only the adiabatic eﬀect, but also one-dimensional
ﬂuid motion and heat advection.
In numerical simulations of a temperature step exper-
iment, they found that the onset of a transient diﬀusive regime occurs about ten times
sooner than estimated by Onuki, Hao and Ferrell [25] in the zero-gravity case, due to the
generation of a small temperature gradient by the adiabatic pressure quench in the pres-
ence of gravity. Boukari et al. also observed that over periods of many hours, no single,
exponentially-decaying mode was ever observed to dominate the diﬀusive equilibration pro-
cess. This conclusion is consistent with measurements and computations of Zhong and Meyer
[36] and Kogan, Zhong and Meyer [17].

The conclusions drawn in these works were based on results derived from one-dimensional

2

systems of equations that do not account for multi-dimensional ﬂows. It is not yet clear how
multi-dimensional ﬂows aﬀect equilibration under gravity. Zappoli et al. [35] have performed
computations of two-dimensional buoyant ﬂow for a van der Waals ﬂuid fairly near the
critical point (1K above critical) where stratiﬁcation eﬀects are not yet very large, using an
‘acoustic ﬁltering’ technique resembling the approach taken in this paper, and have observed
an unusual convection pattern.
In the zero-gravity situation, R. F. Berg [3] has pointed
out certain diﬀerences between one-dimensional and corresponding three-dimensional results
regarding the late diﬀusive regime.

The purpose of this paper is to systematically derive systems of multi-dimensional equa-
tions which govern the dynamics of a low-speed, highly compressible, single-phase ﬂuid in
the presence of gravity. We shall include forces due to capillary stresses that arise from a
contribution made to the energy by strong density gradients. Although there are no sharp
interfaces between phases in equilibrium in the one-phase regime just above the critical tem-
perature, strong gradients can be generated as transients [14]. We anticipate that nonlocal
eﬀects related to the energy of ‘diﬀuse interfaces’ could play a big role in generating transient
ﬂows in certain circumstances that are accessible to experimental observation.

Our starting point is the general hydrodynamic equations expressing the conservation
of mass, linear momentum and energy for a compressible ﬂuid with heat conduction and
gravity. We suppose that the equation of state is appropriate for conditions near the critical
point, and presume that the ﬂuid is in local equilibrium. This implies that the time-scale
of interest is longer than a local relaxation time and that the critical point is not so near
that the correlation length is macroscopic. These assumptions appear to be reasonable for
describing the regimes studied in recent experiments.

To account for the inﬂuence of steep density gradients on energy, we adopt a constitutive
structure compatible with that described in the work of J. E. Dunn and J. Serrin [9]. Dunn
and Serrin permit the constitutive quantities (such as the Cauchy stress tensor) to depend
upon the gradient of the density as well as upon density and temperature, so that capillary
eﬀects can now be included in the equations. We account for such eﬀects in the simplest
way, adding a squared gradient term to the Helmholtz free energy density. The resulting
system of equations in section 2 can be used to study the inﬂuence of hydrodynamics on
heat transfer on a time scale appropriate for resolving sound waves.

Here, however, we are interested in relaxation and ﬂow phenomena that occur very slowly
compared to the time it takes for sound waves to cross the spatial domain. A systematic pro-
cedure for obtaining simpliﬁed equations for compressible ﬂows on long time-scales was intro-
duced by Rehm and Baum [27] and by Majda and Sethian [21] in the context of combustion
theory. In section 3 we apply this procedure to the system at hand. We non-dimensionalize
the equations and estimate the size of the various terms, taking parameters appropriate to
a typical experiment of interest. To obtain a simpliﬁed set of equations, we neglect terms
which make the smallest contribution compared to the other terms.

When the eﬀect of gravity is weak, the result is a simpliﬁed model in which the leading-
order pressure is spatially constant, and which accounts for multi-dimensional ﬂuid motions
inﬂuenced by the eﬀects of thermal expansion and contraction, gravitational compression,

3

thermal diﬀusion, viscosity and capillarity. With viscosity included, this simpliﬁed model
consists of equations (3.12)–(3.16) below, plus the equation of state.

When viscosity is neglected, the simpliﬁed system includes a hyperbolic equation (for
velocity), a parabolic equation (for temperature), an elliptic equation (related to volume
expansion), an ordinary integro-diﬀerential equation (for mean pressure), and an algebraic
equation (the equation of state). In a forthcoming work [8], we prove that the simpliﬁed
model equations are evolutionary; i.e., we show that solutions are determined by suitable
initial data. The initial data required to determine the solution consist of the temperature
ﬁeld, the mean pressure, and the divergence-free part of the velocity ﬁeld. The density is
determined from the temperature and mean pressure via the equation of state.

Earth’s gravity creates a strongly nonlinear density proﬁle in equilibrium when temper-
ature is close to the critical point, due to the high compressibility. This is not well-modelled
by the system (3.12)–(3.16). In section 4 we study how to model multidimensional ﬂows
with strong gravity. If we enforce hydrostatic balance at leading order, as was done for the
one-dimensional case in [5], we ﬁnd that generally the ﬂow must remain strictly stratiﬁed,
and any vertical ﬂuid motions are due only to horizontally uniform density changes.

In order to admit nontrivial convective ﬂows or gravity waves, one can assume that
entropy is constant at leading order and neglect heat conduction. This corresponds to the
assumptions made by Ogura and Phillips [23] in deriving ‘anelastic’ equations for atmospheric
circulations. Here we obtain anelastic equations valid for a general equation of state. The
assumption of approximately constant entropy may not be compatible with thermodynamic
equilibrium near the critical point, but this assumption may be relevant for describing some
experiments that have been performed at near-constant entropy in order to reduce the eﬀect
of density gradients [4, 22]. Because heat conduction is neglected, though, the anelastic
equations do not contain the fast adiabatic heat-transfer mechanism mentioned above.

We ﬁnd a better alternative if we return to the weak-gravity scaling and make a simple
modiﬁcation of the momentum equation. We retain the eﬀect of the pressure correction
on density in the gravity force term, in the spirit of the Boussinesq approximation. This
modiﬁcation does not change the formal validity of the approximation. But the new system,
consisting of equations (4.18)–(4.20) below, correctly captures strongly stratiﬁed thermo-
dynamic equilibria, admits multidimensional ﬂow including gravity waves but not acoustic
waves, and includes heat conduction and the adiabatic mechanism.

3.1 Scaling for the ﬂow regime

In order to see how the system of equations (2.12)–(2.14) can be appropriately simpliﬁed, we
non-dimensionalize and scale the variables in a manner appropriate to a typical experiment,
as follows. The critical density, critical pressure, and critical temperature are denoted ρc,
pc, and Tc, respectively. Let xa be a characteristic length, ta a characteristic time, and
va = xa/ta. Let cpa, cva be characteristic speciﬁc heat capacities at constant pressure and
at constant volume respectively, and let Γ = cpa/cva. Let κa be a characteristic thermal
conductivity, and let λa, µa be characteristic viscosity coeﬃcients (for convenience we assume
λa = µa). Let ga = xa/t2
a, and introduce the following non-dimensional variables and
constants (non-dimensional quantities are indicated by an asterisk, ∗ ):

ta = 1 s and postpone further discussion. The eﬀect of earth’s gravity tends to become
important within about 30 mK of Tc, so we take Ta = 10−4.
In this temperature range
and near the critical density, an appropriate model equation of state is the restricted cubic
model, with coeﬃcients for xenon (see [22] and the references therein). From this model, as

point. To estimate the viscosity, we use the results of [31, Table III], also see [26]. As a

Regarding these parameters, several points are worthy of comment. First, note the eﬀect
of considering longer time scales. As ta increases, S decreases and M 2 decreases quadratically,
DT and Re−1 increase, and c and g∗ increase quadratically. Second, experiments performed
in low earth orbit are reported to experience typical accelerations of 10−4 to 10−6 times
earth’s gravity [22]; this would make g∗ of order 1. (Another way to obtain g∗ of order 1 is
to consider a faster time scale like ta = .01 s.) Also, we note that the value of c becomes
of order 1 when the characteristic length is replaced by a capillary length xcap for which

We should also comment on the eﬀect of proximity to the critical temperature. As Ta
approaches zero, we have seen that the capillary coeﬃcient diverges very weakly, with expo-

3.2 Reduced equations for slow ﬂows

To obtain simpliﬁed equations for compressible ﬂows, we proceed formally in a manner
motivated by the treatments of Rehm and Baum [27] and Majda and Sethian [21]. Since we
are interested in longer time scales, we regard M 2 and S as small and let p0, T0, v0 denote
assumed asymptotic limits of p∗, T ∗, v∗ respectively, as M 2 and S are taken to zero. In this
process we regard g∗ as ﬁxed and of order one, corresponding to a low-gravity environment
for our ﬂow regime. Multiplying the momentum equation (3.1) by M 2 and taking M 2 to 0,
we require

p0(x∗, t∗) = 0,
(3.5)
and therefore p0 = p0(t∗) is constant in space. From (3.2)–(3.3), the asymptotic equations
for temperature and pressure are

3.3 Reformulation

The full system (2.12)–(2.14) is appropriate for describing compressible ﬂuid ﬂow on acoustic
time scales. In the ﬂow regime for xenon that we have described, such time scales are short,
since the sound speed is of the order of tens of meters per second. The simpliﬁed system
(3.6), (3.7), (3.9) represents an ‘acoustic ﬁltering’ of the full system that describes ﬂow on
time scales that are long compared to acoustic. The pressure is maintained spatially constant
through a process mediated by sound wave propagation. (An asymptotic description of this
process for a near-critical van der Waals ﬂuid was given by Zappoli and Carles [34] in one
dimension with no viscosity.)

We conclude this section by indicating how the simpliﬁed equations (3.12)–(3.16), in nondi-
mensional form, can be used to very roughly estimate the time scale t1 for the adiabatic
mechanism described in the introduction to produce a rapid bulk temperature response to
boundary heating.

We consider a homogeneous ﬂuid initially at equilibrium, whose boundary temperature is
raised rapidly. As the boundary temperature is changed, a thin thermal boundary layer is
created next to the wall. The width of this layer increases with time through heat diﬀusion, so
is roughly given by √t∗DT using (3.6). In the boundary layer, we may roughly approximate
the nondimensional temperature T0 by a function of the form f (s/√t∗DT ), where s is the
distance to the boundary. Treating the coeﬃcients in (3.20) as constant, we estimate ∆T0 ≈
(t∗DT )−1f ′′(s/√t∗DT ) in the boundary layer. The integrand in the numerator is then of order
(t∗DT )−1 in the boundary layer and zero elsewhere, and the integrand in the denominator
is of order 1. Suppose the ﬂuid domain is a cube with dimensional side length L = xaL∗.
Then the order of dp0/dt∗ is given by

The time integral of this expression produces an order one change in p0 (hence in T0), when
t = t1 = t∗ta = L2Γ−2/144D, where D = κa/ρccpa is the characteristic thermal diﬀusivity.
For the ﬂuid parameters corresponding to the ﬂow regime which we have described above,
in a cell with side length L = 10−2 m we estimate t1 ≈

10−4 s.

This time is longer but not much longer than the acoustic time tc for a sound wave to
10−4 s. It is unrealistic to expect, however, that
cross the cell, given by tc = L/cs ≈
the boundary temperature can be raised so rapidly in experiment. So what this estimate
indicates is that for processes in which the boundary temperature varies slowly compared
to the acoustic time, the boundary-to-bulk coupling provided by the integro-diﬀerential
equation for the mean pressure is eﬃcient in eﬀecting bulk temperature changes.

The above estimate for t1 is consistent with the results of Onuki and Ferrell [24], except
for the geometric factor of 144 appearing in the denominator. We expect that diﬀusion

4 Multi-dimensional ﬂows with strong gravity

4.1 Motivation

In this section, we re-examine the equations of motion in the case of strong gravity. Mo-
tivating us is the problem of describing near-critical ﬂuid ﬂows and equilibration in earth’s
104 in the ﬂow regime considered in section 3.1 with earth’s grav-
gravity. Recall that
ity. The simpliﬁed system (3.12)–(3.16) fails to capture some key features of equilibration
in this situation.

In equilibrium, temperature is constant and density is stratiﬁed according to the basic

equation of hydrostatic balance,

and the equation of state. (We will neglect capillarity in most of this section.) Denoting
equilibrium temperature by Te and density by ρe(z), the equilibrium density gradient satisﬁes

p =

ρg,

(z) =

χT (ρe(z), Te)g.

−

As temperature approaches Tc, the critical temperature, χT (ρc, Te), the susceptibility on the
critical isochore, diverges as in (3.4). Thus the density gradient develops a singularity at the
level of critical density, and the density proﬁle becomes highly nonlinear. In Fig. 1 we plot
density proﬁles for xenon in equilibrium at 1G, using the restricted cubic equation of state
as in [5].

For the simpliﬁed system (3.12)–(3.16), however, the density in equilibrium is constant,
ρg from (3.14) can be interpreted
given by ρ = ˆρ(pe, Te). The hydrostatic balance
as supplying an O(M 2) correction to the leading order pressure. This correction is linear in
z and could be used to generate a density correction (by linearizing the equation of state,
for example). But as it stands, the system (3.12)–(3.16) relies only on the leading-order

(4.2)

where ¯ρ(z) is usually deﬁned either as the density in an adiabatically stratiﬁed, horizon-
tally uniform reference state, or as the horizontally-averaged actual density. Batchelor [2]
introduced an equation equivalent to (4.2). The name ‘anelastic’ was given by Ogura and
Phillips [23], who derived (4.2), together with approximate momentum and thermodynamic
equations, through a systematic scale analysis. Important assumptions in their analysis are
that: (i) all deviations δθ of the ‘potential temperature’ from some constant mean value θa
are small (this is equivalent to a similar statement for entropy variations), and (ii) the time
scale of the disturbance is similar to the time scale for gravity wave oscillations. The terms
neglected in their approximation are formally an order ǫ = δθ/θa smaller than those which
are retained. Their anelastic system does not support sound waves, does support gravity
waves and conserves energy. Ogura and Phillips deﬁne ¯ρ as the density in an adiabatically
stratiﬁed, horizontally uniform reference state.

Some of the largest errors in the Ogura-Phillips anelastic approximation are reported
to be generated by large deviations of the mean state potential temperature (or entropy)

14

from a constant reference value. Several authors (Dutton and Fichtl [11], Wilhelmson and
Ogura [32], Lipps and Hemler [19], Durran [10]) have presented alternative ‘sound-proof’
equations in which thermodynamic variables associated with the adiabatic reference state
are replaced with horizontally-uniform averaged or approximate actual values. These authors
make diﬀerent approximations in the momentum equations, but (except for Durran) they all
obtain a continuity equation of the form (4.2) in which ¯ρ is deﬁned as a horizontally-averaged
approximation to the actual density.

In the remainder of this section, we describe three possible models for multi-dimensional
ﬂows under strong gravity, making diﬀerent assumptions about how to balance and approx-
imate terms in the nondimensionalized system (3.1)–(3.3):

(1) At ﬁrst we scale so as to enforce hydrostatic balance at leading order. We ﬁnd then
that to be consistent, at leading order the thermodynamic variables must remain hor-
izontally uniform. Also the vertical velocity must remain horizontally uniform, unless
we assume the entropy is spatially constant to leading order.

(2) If we indeed assume that entropy is spatially constant to leading order and also neglect
heat conduction, we obtain a generalization of the anelastic approximation valid for a
general equation of state.

(3) Neither choice so far admits both thermodynamic equilibrium states and non-stratiﬁed
multidimensional ﬂows. We ﬁnd, however, that if we return to the scaling adopted
in section 3.1, and modify the momentum equation so that the gravity force term
incorporates a pressure correction self-consistently, then we get a system of the same
formal accuracy that admits physically correct equilibrium states exactly. Moreover
the new system supports gravity waves but not acoustic waves.

4.2 Strongly stratiﬁed ﬂow

Because equilibria are governed by the equation of hydrostatic balance, if gravity is strong
it is natural to try and balance the pressure gradient term with the gravity term in the
nondimensional momentum equation (3.1). Thus we regard M −2 and
to be of the same
|
order. This same approach was taken in [5] for one-dimensional ﬂows.

In this approximation, we rescale the gravitational acceleration, writing g∗ = M −2¯g
where ¯g = O(1). It will prove instructive to replace (p, T ) by (p, s) as the thermodynamic
state variables, where s is the speciﬁc entropy density. In terms of these variables, we write
the equation of state as ρ = ˜ρ(p, s). In nondimensional form, we write ρ∗ = ˜ρ∗(p∗, s∗), where
entropy is nondimensionalized via the relation s = sas∗. It is convenient to take sa = cpaTa;
this will be discussed further in the next subsection.

Starting from the nondimensionalized system (3.1)–(3.3) with the replacement g∗ =
M −2¯g, we proceed as in section 3.2 and regard M 2 and S as small, obtaining the temperature
evolution equation (3.6) and continuity equation (3.7). In terms of the leading order pressure

follows that ρ0 = ρ0(z∗, t∗) is also horizontally uniform. The equation of state now implies
that s0 = s0(z∗, t∗) as well. The entropy and pressure equations (4.3)–(4.4) now read

ﬂuid ﬂows within each material layer corresponding to z′ =const. Presuming that p1 yields
an O(M 2) correction to the leading order pressure, we may write the horizontal components

The vertical component of the momentum equation at order 1 can be used in deter-
mining higher-order corrections of order M 2 for horizontally averaged density, pressure and
temperature. For the sake of brevity we omit further discussion.

4.3 The anelastic approximation

In order to admit convective ﬂows with nontrivial vertical circulation and/or gravity waves,
we can suppose that the entropy is spatially constant at leading order. As we have indicated,
this is the same as the assumption made by Ogura and Phillips that potential temperature
variations are small compared to a reference value.

At leading order, then, the ﬂuid density, pressure and temperature are in hydrostatic
balance and adiabatically stratiﬁed, with a (negative) adiabatic temperature gradient. We
must neglect heat conduction to maintain entropy constant; this restricts the time scale, and
any ﬂows generated will be adiabatic.

To describe ﬂows, we use the notation of section 3.1 for nondimensional and leading-
order quantities, and nondimensionalize entropy according to s = sas∗ where sa = cpaTa
(as discussed below). We postulate that the nondimensional pressure p∗ and entropy s∗ are
given to order O(M 2) by

p∗

p0(z∗) + M 2p1(x∗, t∗),

s∗

s0 + M 2s1(x∗, t∗),

∼

where s0 is a constant. (This neglects any fast-time acoustic corrections that may be present
as discussed in [16].) Then we expect the density ρ∗
ρ0(z∗) + M 2ρ1(x∗, t∗), where from the

This constraint on the velocity should be used in solving (4.14) to determine p1. Note,
however, that p1 will not be completely determined by the constraint — Given any solution

The equations (4.14)–(4.16) correspond to the anelastic equations of Ogura and Phillips,
generalized for an arbitrary equation of state.

As a model for slow ﬂows of ﬂuids near the critical point, these equations have some
drawbacks: First, heat conduction is entirely neglected, so the fast adiabatic mechanism for
rapid thermal response is not accounted for within this model. Also the eﬀect of ﬂuid ﬂow
on thermal relaxation cannot be evaluated. Moreover, describing states in thermodynamic
equilibrium is problematic. At rest, the equations permit an arbitrary horizontally uniform
entropy correction s1. It may or may not be consistent with the derivation of the equations
to take this to correspond to the equilibrium entropy proﬁle (meaning the hydrostatic proﬁle
at constant temperature).

Regarding this point, we can ask, what is the size of the nondimensional equilibrium
entropy gradient in the regime of interest? To estimate this, we need to identify a typical
entropy change in a process of interest. Consider a ﬂuid at equilibrium at one temperature,
subject to a temperature change at the boundary of order TcTa. During the early development
of the thermal boundary layer, we may suppose roughly that the entropy change in the
boundary layer occurs at constant pressure, so it is of order sa = cpaTa since (∂s/∂T )p = cp/T
and Ta is small. Then it seems reasonable to nondimensionalize the entropy by letting
s = sas∗.

It seems that in our ﬂow regime, the entropy gradient may not be small enough for
the anelastic approximation to be reasonable for states near true equilibrium (at least at
the level of critical density). But states near constant entropy do possess experimental
interest. Physically, the condition that an inviscid stratiﬁed ﬂuid is stable against convection
is ds/dz < 0 [18]. In order to obtain ‘pseudo-equilibrium’ states with near-uniform density
proﬁles, ground-based experiments have been suggested on near-critical ﬂuids in which a
steady-state heat ﬂux is maintained so as to achieve a marginally stable entropy proﬁle [22],
also see [4]. Note that the adiabatic density gradient satisﬁes ρ−1dρ/dz =
s, which
is about 1/500 m−1 in our ﬂow regime, so the density is close to constant in centimeter-
sized cells. Provided that heat conduction can be neglected on the time scale of interest,
the anelastic approximation could be useful to describe ﬂows near such ‘pseudo-equilibrium’
states.

4.4 Slow ﬂows including equilibrium

In trying to enforce hydrostatic balance at leading order, we have found that either ﬂows
remain strictly stratiﬁed, or equilibrium states are not admissible as entropy must be constant
at leading order in M 2. In this section we return to the scaling as it was done in section
3.2, in which the leading-order pressure turns out to be spatially constant. Working in the
spirit of the Boussinesq approximation, we can decide to selectively retain some terms of
higher order in M 2 where it would be most useful, without aﬀecting the formal accuracy of
the system.

We propose no alteration in the equations (3.6)-(3.7) for leading-order temperature and
mean pressure. (But now p0 and T0 will depend on M 2, through the coupling to the mo-
mentum equation.) To order M 2, supposing that the pressure is given by p∗
p0 + M 2p1,
the approximation to the density ρ

ρ0 = ˆρ∗(p0, T0) can be improved to

∼

≈
ˇρ

ρ

≈

≡

ˆρ∗(p0 + M 2p1, T0).

We propose to make this improvement only in equation (3.9) for the velocity. The new
system of equations governing leading-order temperature, pressure and velocity (neglecting

The temperature evolution and continuity equations (4.18)–(4.19) may be replaced by the
equivalent pair (4.3)–(4.4), in which the material derivative Dp0/Dt∗ can be replaced by the
ordinary derivative dp0/dt∗.

As with the anelastic equations, the pressure correction p1 should be determined in
solving (4.20) to satisfy the implied constraint on the divergence of velocity from (4.19).
The pressure correction will not be unique, but any two solutions p1 and ˜p1 that correspond
to the same (p0, T0, v0) will be related by

p1 + ˆρ∗(p0 + M 2p1, T0)g∗ =

˜p1 + ˆρ∗(p0 + M 2 ˜p1, T0)g∗.

˜p1 is a function of z∗ and t∗ that is determined solely in terms

The system consisting of equations (4.18)–(4.20) can be reformulated to better reveal
its evolutionary character exactly as in section 3.3.
In dimensional form with pressure
¯p(t) + π(x, t), where ¯p = pc(1 + pap0) and π = pcpaM 2p1, one obtains exactly the system

where the (now dimensional) density ˇρ is determined from pressure and temperature by the
equation of state: ˇρ = ˆρ(¯p + π, T ). We anticipate that, like system (3.12)–(3.16), solutions of
(4.18)–(4.20) are determined by initial values for the temperature ﬁeld, mean pressure, and
divergence-free part of the velocity ﬁeld.

The system (4.18)–(4.20) admits as rest states true equilibrium states with constant
temperature and hydrostatic balance between the total pressure p0 + M 2p1 and the improved
density ˇρ = ˆρ∗(p0 + M 2p1, T0). It ﬁlters acoustic waves but admits gravity waves, as we shall
show in the subsection to follow. Moreover, heat conduction need not be neglected, so the
adiabatic eﬀect can be modeled. It should be interesting to study what ﬂows are generated
when large density changes in the thermal boundary layer are present together with very
stable equilibrium entropy proﬁles away from the boundary.

We remark that it is evidently not necessary to replace ρ0 by ˇρ in the acceleration
term of (3.9) to gain true equilibria as rest states. In some circumstances it may be more
convenient not to make this replacement. But it turns out that equation (4.20) is slightly

20

more convenient when we study the linearized equations for gravity waves; see the next
section.

The system (4.18)–(4.20) certainly has shortcomings. First, in the ﬂow regime described
a/xa is still rather large. This problem diminishes if a larger space
in section 3.1,
scale or smaller time scale is relevant. The system can be expected to lose formal validity if
solutions become large or singular, as may well happen in a nonadiabatic convection process.
Another point is that while the leading-order total energy is conserved in time for the weak-
gravity equations (3.12)–(3.16), this is not strictly true for the system (4.18)–(4.20). The
time derivative of the leading-order total energy is formally of order M 2 instead.

4.5 Gravity waves in the linear approximation

We wish to verify that in the linear approximation near a stably stratiﬁed rest state for
which entropy decreases with height, the system (4.18)–(4.20) admits gravity waves but not
acoustic waves when heat conduction and viscosity are neglected. We shall also show that, in
the special case of a perfect gas with an exponential density proﬁle and constant sound speed,
in the limit of large wave number the gravity-wave frequency approaches the Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a
frequency N corresponding to a compressible ﬂuid. This frequency satisﬁes

The second term does not appear in the usual treatment of gravity waves for a stratiﬁed
incompressible ﬂuid, in which the density is advected with the ﬂow, cf. [33].

When heat conduction and viscosity are neglected in the system (4.18)–(4.20), the leading-
order pressure is constant in time as well as space. Consequently the temperature (and en-
tropy) are advected with the ﬂow, and the velocity ﬁeld has zero divergence. In dimensional
form with p = ¯p + π and ˇρ = ˜ρ(p, s), the governing equations take the form

Since the second integrand cannot be everywhere nonnegative, it follows that

The dispersion relation in (4.29) is very similar to that obtained in the usual case of an
incompressible ﬂuid when one assumes the density is advected with the ﬂow. Starting from
the governing equations

one ﬁnds in similar fashion that the equation corresponding to (4.28) is

In the limit k2
0 , where N0 is the usual Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a frequency
for an incompressible ﬂuid. In many circumstances the diﬀerence between N0 and N may be
negligible, but it is interesting that the dispersion relation arising from the system (4.24)–
(4.26) more faithfully approximates the compressible case in this respect.

4.6 Final remarks

We close with a few remarks intended to clarify the diﬀerences between the new system
(4.18)–(4.20) and the anelastic system (4.13)–(4.16). For purposes of comparison, we neglect
heat conduction. In this case, the new system (4.3), (4.4), (4.20) becomes

where ρ0 = ˜ρ∗(p0, s0). For the anelastic system, the leading order entropy s0 is constant
and the pressure p0 is a function of z determined by the hydrostatic balance equation (4.5),
so Dρ0/Dt∗ = w0∂ρ0/∂z∗. Using hydrostatic balance we can also write (4.16) in the form
essentially given by Batchelor [2]:

(4.40)

For the new system (4.36)–(4.38), since p0 is a constant when heat conduction is neglected,
we have Dρ0/Dt∗ = 0 and this is why the velocity ﬁeld is divergence-free. Note that if we
seek to ‘improve’ equation (4.39) by replacing ρ0 by ˇρ = ˜ρ∗(p0 + M 2p1, s0), then we recover
the original fully compressible system without simpliﬁcation! Indeed, the essential diﬀerence
between the fully compressible system (3.1)–(3.3) (neglecting heat conduction and viscous
power terms), and system (4.36)–(4.38) with p∗ = p0 + M 2p1, is precisely that in the new
system a term proportional to M 2Dp1/Dt∗ is neglected in the continuity equation.

This point suggests a modiﬁcation to the system (4.36)–(4.38) in a situation with possible
relevance for atmospheric circulations. Suppose gravity is rather strong but the pressure
correction p1 does not happen to deviate signiﬁcantly (more than O(1)) from some time-
independent reference state ¯p(z∗) that determines a reference density proﬁle ¯ρ(z∗) via a
hydrostatic balance equation

¯p =

¯ρ(z∗)g∗.

Then we replace ρ0 in (4.39) by ¯ρ0 = ˜ρ∗(p0 + M 2 ¯p, s0). Note that ¯ρ0 can depend on (x∗, y∗, t∗)
as well as z∗ through s0. Since M 2D ¯p/Dt∗ = M 2w0(d¯p/dz∗), the continuity equation be-

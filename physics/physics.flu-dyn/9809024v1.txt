A necessary and suﬃcient instability condition for
inviscid shear ﬂow

N. J. Balmforth
and
P. J. Morrison ∗

February 1998

Abstract

We derive a condition that is necessary and suﬃcient for the instability of inviscid, two-
dimensional, plane parallel, shear ﬂow with equilibrium velocity proﬁles that are monotonic,
real analytic, functions of the cross stream coordinate. The analysis, which is based upon the
Nyquist method, includes a means for delineating the possible kinds of bifurcations that involve
the presence of the continuous spectrum, including those that occur at nonzero wavenumber.
Several examples are given.

Key words: Shear ﬂow, stability theory, Nyquist method.

Introduction

The linear stability of inviscid, incompressible, two-dimensional, plane parallel, shear ﬂow was
considered over a century ago by Rayleigh, Kelvin, and others. A principal result on the subject is
Rayleigh’s celebrated inﬂection point theorem [1], which states that for an equilibrium ﬂow to be
unstable, the equilibrium velocity proﬁle must contain an inﬂection point. That is, if the velocity
proﬁle is given by U (y), where y is the cross-stream coordinate, then there must be a point, y = yI ,
for which U ′′(yI ) = 0. Much later, in 1950, Fjørtoft [2] generalized the theorem by showing that,
moreover, if there is one inﬂection point, then U ′′′(yI )/U ′(yI ) < 0 is required for instability (see
[3] for further extensions). Both Rayleigh’s Theorem and Fjørtoft’s subsequent generalization are
necessary conditions for instability, but they are not suﬃcient. That is, even though an equilibrium
proﬁle may contain a vorticity minimum, it is not necessarily unstable. The point of this paper is to
derive, for a large class of equilibrium velocity proﬁles, a condition that is necessary and suﬃcient
for instability.

1.1 Overview

The procedure we use to derive the instability condition is inspired by techniques developed for
the Vlasov equation. For that problem one can ﬁnd a condition that is necessary and suﬃcient

for instability by using the Nyquist method, a method that leads to what is known as the Penrose
criterion [4] in plasma physics. The Penrose criterion follows fairly straightforwardly for the linear
Vlasov problem because the discrete eigenvalues satisfy an explicit dispersion relation. However, in
the context of the Euler equation governing the shearing ﬂuid, the relevant eigenvalue problem leads
to Rayleigh’s equation. This equation cannot be manipulated into an explicit dispersion relation,
and a suﬃcient condition for instability of velocity proﬁles of a general form has not previously
been given. We note, though, that [5] and [6] present a suﬃcient condition for long wave instability,
and in [5] a necessary and suﬃcient condition for instability of proﬁles with a single inﬂection point
(where bifurcations are restricted to occur through zero wavenumber) was obtained.

Here we derive a condition that is necessary and suﬃcient for instability for a class of velocity
proﬁles, U (y), where y is the cross stream coordinate. Speciﬁcally, we consider proﬁles that are
monotonic functions when y ∈ [−1, 1], which we refer to as the “ﬂow domain,” and which are real
analytic. This latter limitation means that U (y) has a convergent Taylor series on [−1, 1] and thus
possesses an analytic continuation into the complex y-plane. Hence, there exists a neighborhood
(an open set of the complex plane) that contains the interval [−1, 1] in which U (y) is analytic and in
which U ′(y) 6= 0. We assume this neighborhood is as large as is needed in subsequent calculations.
Both the monotonicity and analyticity limitations can be generalized, but we will not attempt this
here.

1.2 Summary of result

In the remainder of this section we summarize our main result, which amounts to a prescription for
obtaining the condition that is necessary and suﬃcient for instability: given the solution, ψ(y, cr),
to the Fredholm integral equation,

ψ(y, cr) = G(y, yc) +

where P denotes the Cauchy principal value. We then plot ǫ(cr) on the (ǫr, ǫi)−plane for cr
running from U (−1) to U (1), or, equivalently, for yc along the interval [−1, 1]. The proﬁle U (y)
is exponentially unstable for that value of k used in Eq. (1) if and only if the resulting path loops
around the origin, ǫr = ǫi = 0. In fact, the path can only cross the ǫr−axis at the inﬂection points,
yI , of the velocity proﬁle where U ′′(yI ) = 0. This leads to the following necessary and suﬃcient
condition for instability: ǫr(cI ) < 0 with cI = U (yI), or equivalently

U ′′(y)ψ(y, cI )

In order to prove the result outlined above we need various mathematical results concerning
Rayleigh’s equation. These are derived in Sections 2–5. Application to speciﬁc equilibrium velocity
proﬁles is presented in Sections 6 and 7. Finally, in Section 8 we summarize, place our work in
context, and discuss future developments.

2.1 Formulation

For a two-dimensional, inviscid ﬂuid contained within the channel, x ∈ (−∞, ∞) and y ∈ [−1, 1],
an equilibrium state is given by any ﬂow, (U, 0), where U = U (y) is the equilibrium velocity proﬁle.
Inﬁnitesimal disturbances to such an equilibrium are described by the equation [1],

∂t ˜ω + U (y)∂x ˜ω = U

′′

(y)∂x ˜ψ,

where ˜ω(x, y, t) is the vorticity perturbation, ˜ψ(x, y, t) is the associated streamfunction, which are
related by

˜ω = ∇2 ˜ψ,
(5)
and the boundary conditions are ˜ψ(x, ±1, t) = 0. Throughout this paper we will consider solutions
of the form ˜ω = ω(k, y, t) exp(ikx) and ˜ψ = ψ(k, y, t) exp(ikx), in which case (4) becomes

if y > y′
if y < y′ .

Here and henceforth we suppress the k-dependence in the arguments of all functions.

2.2 Laplace transform

We need some results associated with the Laplace transform approach to the solution of (6) as an
initial value problem; so we give a brief review of this approach here. More detailed accounts are
given in [7], [8], and with considerably more rigor in [9].

Recall, the Laplace transform pair is

where ω(y, 0), the initial value of the vorticity, satisﬁes ω(y, 0) = (∂2/∂y2 −k2)ψ(y, 0). The solution
to (8) can be written formally as

Here Ψ1 and Ψ2 are any two solutions to (10) with the right-hand side set to zero and that satisfy the
boundary conditions, Ψ1(−1, p) = Ψ2(1, p) = 0. Since (10) does not contain a term involving the
ﬁrst derivative with respect to y, it is an elementary result (see [10], Chap. V) that the Wronskian
is independent of y. Arguments pertaining to the inverse Laplace transform of (11) imply that the
dispersion relation for discrete normal modes is given by

2.3 Normal modes

An alternative approach to Laplace transformation follows when we search for normal modes at the
outset by assuming that ω(y, t) = ω(y) exp(−ikct) and ψ(y, t) = ψ(y) exp(−ikct). Inserting these
expressions into (6) yields Rayleigh’s equation,

section we describe some properties of this equation, for both real and imaginary values of c, that
we will need later.

3 Rayleigh’s equation

3.1 Singular points and solutions in the complex plane

We will need several facts about the solutions to Rayleigh’s equation (15). Firstly, the point yc, for
which U (yc) = c, is a singular point of (15). If c is real then this point is commonly referred to as a
“critical layer.” Since U (y) is a monotonic function for y ∈ [−1, 1] there is at most one such critical
layer in the ﬂow domain, and this occurs when c is in the range of U (y). Because of monotonicity
and real analyticity of U for y in the ﬂow domain, there exists a neighborhood of [−1, 1] in the
complex plane in which the only singular point of (15) is the critical layer. We add that, about any
point of the ﬂow domain, there exists a neighborhood in which the complex variables yc and c are
in one-to-one correspondence. Without loss of generality, we will take U ′(y) > 0 when y ∈ [−1, 1]
for deﬁniteness.

Rayleigh’s equation has a singular point at the critical layer, but this is not the only possible
singular point. First, there may be other points in the complex y plane for which U (y) = c.
Second, although no others exist when U is continued into a neighborhood of [−1, 1], it is likely
that additional singular points occur in U when that function is further analytically continued
into the complex plane. These singularities can then show up in Rayleigh’s equation (though it is
worth noting that because U occurs in Rayleigh’s equation only in the coeﬃcient U ′′/(U − c), for
meromorphic U all singular points in the ﬁnite complex plane are regular; this can easily be shown
by Laurent expansion). However, here we will only need to consider the critical layer.

From the elementary theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations in the complex plane (see e.g.
[11], Chap. X) it is known that there are two analytic solutions for y in a neighborhood of any
ordinary point. Moreover, in general, branch points occur in the solution at the locations of regular
singular points. If we ﬁx the two parameters, k and c, then the locations of the singular points are
ﬁxed for a given equilibrium proﬁle.

In a neighborhood of the critical point in the complex y-plane it is straightforward to obtain

two Frobenius series solutions of the following form:

ψg(y, c) = [U (y) − c]ϕ1(y, c)

and

ψb(y, c) = [U (y) − c] log |U (y) − c|ϕ2(y, c) + ϕ3(y, c),

where ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3 are analytic for y in this neighborhood and for c in the ﬁnite complex c-plane.

(16)

(17)

5

The Frobenius solutions can be used to construct neutral eigenmodes (with c real). We will go
about this construction shortly; however, Rayleigh’s equation may also have complex eigenmode
solutions, for which c is complex, and we consider these ﬁrst.

3.2 Complex eigenmodes

When c is complex, there is no singular point in Rayleigh’s equation for y ∈ [−1, 1], and we
may then eliminate ω between (15) and (7) to obtain an integral equation for the streamfunction
(eigenfunction) of the complex eigenmodes:

ψ(y, c) =

′

G(y, y

)

1

−1

Z

U ′′(y′)ψ(y′, c)
U (y′) − c

′

dy

.

(18)

This has the form of a Fredholm equation, and if there is a solution for c = cD, that solution is
known to be unique (e.g. [12]). Moreover, the conjugate, c = c∗
D, is also a solution. These complex
conjugates comprise a pair of discrete eigenvalues, of which there can only be a ﬁnite number. In
fact, at the end of this paper, we essentially give an upper bound on their number.

The complex pairs that satisfy (18) are equivalent to the homogeneous solutions of (10). Alter-
D are the zeros of the Wronskian (14) of the Laplace transform

natively, the values c = cD and c = c∗
theory.

According to the Rayleigh-Fjørtoft Theorem, instabilities occur only if the velocity proﬁle con-
tains a minimum in vorticity (since we assume U ′ > 0, the vorticity is everywhere negative). Thus,
because Im c > 0 signiﬁes instability, the theorem implies that the complex, discrete eigenmodes
can only exist if the vorticity has a minimum.

3.3 Neutral discrete eigenmodes

The solution of Rayleigh’s problem for the neutral eigenmodes is not so clear cut. In fact, if c is
real, then there can be no nontrivial, regular solutions for the streamfunction, with only a single
exceptional type of mode. This follows from two facts. First, if c < U (−1) = U1 or c > U (1) = U2,
then Rayleigh’s equation with the assumed boundary conditions has only a trivial solution. Thus
neutral solutions must have critical layers. Second, if c lies within the ﬂow domain, [U1, U2], then
it can be shown that ψg cannot satisfy the boundary conditions (e.g. [13]). Therefore, all neutral
eigenmodes must contain the “bad” solution ψb(y, c), in which case ψ(y, c) must have an undeﬁned
derivative. This failure to construct real analytic neutral eigenfunctions is connected to the presence
of a continuous spectrum that occurs for wavespeeds lying inside the ﬂow domain: c ∈ [U (−1), U (1)]
[7].

The exceptional class of modes are those for which the critical layer lines up with an inﬂexion
point of the equilibrium ﬂow proﬁle. In this case, U ′′(yc) = 0, and the singular point is removed
from Rayleigh’s equation. The Frobenius solution, ψb(y, c), is then an analytic function. The
exceptional modes also satisfy equation (18), but now c = U (yc) = U (yI ), where yI is the location
of an inﬂection point. We call these eigensolutions, “inﬂection-point modes.” These are discrete
eigenmodes embedded in the continuous spectrum.

One important feature of the inﬂection-point modes is that they must be the limits of the
complex pairs as Im(c) → 0. In fact, they are the basis of the Tollmien-Lin perturbation theory,
which builds the nearby complex solutions from the inﬂection-point mode. This perturbation
expansion is normally performed with an underlying assumption that the limit exists. Though this

6

is largely a technicality, the assumption is strictly only valid when U (y) is an analytic function on
[−1, 1] (this is one of the results that comes directly out of the complex analysis described here).

3.4 Singular eigensolutions
Neutral eigenmodes cannot, therefore, be real analytic at the critical layer if U ′′(yc) 6= 0. Conse-
quently, because the derivative of the streamfunction is not deﬁned for these modes, we can only
impose continuity on such solutions to Rayleigh’s equation. Thus ψ(y, c) may have an arbitrary
jump in its ﬁrst derivative at y = yc. Any family of such solutions can be taken to be a set of
singular eigenfunctions of the continuous spectrum. However, there is one family that is especially
useful, and we now construct these special singular eigenmodes.

The singular eigenfunctions are generalized function solutions to Rayleigh’s equation (see [14]

and [15]):

ω(y, c) = P

+ λ(c) δ[U (y) − c],

(19)

U ′′ψ
U − c

where P indicates the Cauchy Principal Value, δ(U − c) is Dirac’s delta function, and λ is yet to
be determined. With the interpretation of the singularity in (19) by means of the Cauchy principal
value, we may deﬁne the jump in the derivative of ψ by λ/U ′(yc). This quantity is currently
arbitrary and in particular can be taken to be any function of c. Our special singular eigenmodes
arise from a judicious choice for λ.

If we integrate (19) across the channel, we obtain

since ω is a generalized function, the amplitude of the eigenmode can only be ﬁxed on multiplying
by a suitable test function and integrating. In Eq. (21), the test function is simply unity, and so Ξ
can be regarded as the eigenfunction amplitude. Moreover, since this is a linear problem, we may
choose the dependence of Ξ as we wish; this then amounts to the selection of λ.

On using (7), (19), and (22), we ﬁnd:

Although (23) is at ﬁrst sight a singular integral equation, (24) is a regular Fredholm equation of
the second kind (e.g. [12]) that is straightforward to solve.

Provided the Fredholm equation has no homogeneous solution, (24) has a unique particular
solution. If (24) does have a homogeneous solution, particular solutions are, in general, unbounded.

(20)

(21)

(23)

(24)

The important point is that a family of well-behaved singular eigenmodes is needed to represent
the continuous spectrum. If there are no homogeneous solutions, any choice for Ξ(c) will suﬃce for
this purpose. But if there are homogeneous solutions, a more specialized choice must be made. One
possible selection is Ξ(c) = D(c), where D(c) is the Fredholm determinant. With this selection, the
inhomogeneous term automatically vanishes if there is a homogeneous solution. This ensures that
the solution to the Fredholm problem is always bounded. Hence, even if there are homogeneous
solutions, we can always ﬁnd a set of sensible singular eigenmodes. (Note that D(yc) is determined
by the kernel in (24), that is G(y, y′) and U (y), and is independent of the solution, ψ(y, c), and so
there is freedom for this selection for Ξ(c).)

For Rayleigh’s problem with the proﬁles we have considered, we have not found any homoge-
neous solutions to (24). So Ξ(c) = 1 is a convenient choice in any practical application. Then,
from (19) and (22), we compute the singular eigenfunction and the jump in the streamfunction’s
derivative.

Finally, note that the amplitude of the solution at the critical layer, ψ(yc, c), cannot vanish,
since the Frobenius solution (17) satisﬁes ψb(yc, c) 6= 0. This is an important property of the
singular eigenfunctions that will be used later.

4 The dispersion relation

In this section we construct an expression for the dispersion relation. The form of the dispersion
relation is designed to facilitate the subsequent Nyquist analysis, and is one that is useful for
relating discrete eigenmodes to continuum eigenmodes.

4.1 Discontinuity and the dispersion relation

We begin by considering an arbitrary point y∗ that is not coincident with the critical layer; i.e. y∗
is any ordinary point of the diﬀerential equation. For convenience we choose y∗ ∈ [−1, 1] and we
assume that c is ﬁxed in the upper half c-plane.

Now we construct two solutions, Ψ<(y, c) and Ψ>(y, c), that are deﬁned for y ∈ [−1, 1] on the
complex c-plane. The ﬁrst, Ψ<(y, c), is deﬁned by series expansion about the left boundary point
y = −1 and satisﬁes the boundary condition Ψ<(−1, c) = 0. This is a one-parameter family of
solutions, where the parameter can be taken to be a multiplicative constant; i.e. we can write
Ψ<(y, c) = C<Φ<(y, c), where Φ<(y, c) is a parameter-independent solution of Rayleigh’s equation
that satisﬁes Φ<(−1, c) = 0 and Φ′
<(−1, c) = 1. Similarly, a second one-parameter family of
solutions is constructed by series expansion about the point y = 1. We denote this second solution
by Ψ>(y, c) = C>Φ>(y, c), where by construction Φ>(1, c) = 0 and Φ′
>(1, c) = 1. We emphasize
that at ﬁxed y ∈ [−1, 1], both Φ<(y, c) and Φ>(y, c) are analytic in c for all c 6= U (y).

The next step in our construction is to choose the constants C< and C> so that Ψ< and Ψ> are
continuous at the point y∗; i.e. we set Ψ<(y∗, c) = Ψ>(y∗, c). This requirement leaves a remaining
constant that is an overall scaling factor; the two solutions can be represented as follows:

Ψ<(y, c, y∗) = C(c, y∗)Φ>(y∗, c)Φ<(y, c)

Ψ>(y, c, y∗) = C(c, y∗)Φ<(y∗, c)Φ>(y, c) ,

(25)

where the sole remaining constant is C(c, y∗), in which we have included dependence upon c and

8

y∗. Clearly, we are free to choose C(c, y∗) arbitrarily. We give a prescription for deﬁning C(c, y∗)
shortly.

No matter which (nonzero) value is chosen for C(c, y∗), the derivatives of the functions Ψ<
and Ψ> will not, for general values of c, match at the point y∗. However, in the event that they
do match, the value of c is an eigenvalue and the functions Ψ< and Ψ> deﬁne an eigenfunction.
In fact, when this is the case, Ψ< and Ψ> are analytic continuations of each other. This follows
because y∗ is an ordinary point and both Ψ< and Ψ> are solutions of the Cauchy problem for
Rayleigh’s equation with identical speciﬁcation of their values and derivatives at y∗. Moreover,
when the derivatives of the solutions match, the point y∗ is immaterial and the dependence upon
y∗ drops out of the incipient eigenfunction.

In light of the above, the jump in the derivatives of Ψ< and Ψ> at y∗ is equivalent to a dispersion
relation: its vanishing determines c = c(k). (Recall that the k dependence has been suppressed in
the expressions above.) Note that if C(c, y∗) is chosen to be an analytic function of c in the upper
half plane, then Ψ<(y∗, c) and Ψ>(y∗, c) are also analytic functions of c in the upper half plane,
which follows from the assumption U (y∗) 6= c. Hence, the dispersion relation is an analytic function
for c in the upper half plane. Also, note that the dispersion relation does not depend upon the
point y∗, since matching of the derivatives at any point will give an eigenfunction.

4.2 Relationship between ǫ and W

We now obtain a convenient expression for the dispersion relation.

In general, for y within the ﬂow domain, we write the streamfunction in the form,

Ψ(y, c, y∗) := H(y − y∗)Ψ>(y, c, y∗) + H(y∗ − y)Ψ<(y, c, y∗)

and H is the Heaviside function. The vorticity, by which we mean ω(y, c, y∗) = Ψ′′ − k2Ψ, then has
a representation,

ω(y, c, y∗) = Ω(y, c, y∗) + ˜ǫ(c, y∗) δ(y − y∗) .

where ˜ǫ(c, y∗) measures the jump in the derivatives,

Because Φ< and Φ> are analytic in c in the upper half plane for ﬁxed y, the quantity in the
denominator of the right-hand side of (34) is also analytic. Thus, if we were to select C(c, y∗) to
be analytic in the upper half c−plane, then ˜Ξ(c, y∗) would also be. However, the converse is not
quite true: if ˜Ξ(c, y∗) is selected to be analytic in the upper half plane, then C(c, y∗) is also analytic
except, perhaps, for poles at the zeros of the denominator. We will interpret these zeros shortly.

4.3 Rayleigh Green function and singular eigenfunctions

The next piece of the puzzle is to relate the dispersion relation to the singular eigenfunctions.

We may rewrite (27) in the form,

′′

Ψ

− k2Ψ −

= ˜ǫ δ(y − y∗) .

U ′′Ψ
U − c

Thus, Ψ is related to the Green function for Rayleigh’s equation. This equation is a bit subtle,
since ˜ǫ (according to (32)) is in fact a property of the solution and so the equation is self-referential.
However, if y∗ 6= yc and ˜ǫ 6= 0, then Ψ/˜ǫ satisﬁes the normal equation for the Green function.

We may turn equation (35) into one of integral form on using the Green function of the Lapla-

Ψ(y, c, y∗) = G(y, y∗)˜ǫ(c, y∗) +

′

G(y, y

)

U ′′(y)Ψ(y′, c, y∗)
U (y′) − c

.

Moreover, on using the relation (32), this can be written as

Ψ(y, c, y∗) = ˜Ξ(c, y∗)G(y, y∗) +

′

Ψ(y

, c, y∗) K(y, y

Hence the Green function can be constructed by solving another Fredholm integral equation.

In fact, the two Fredholm problems are closely related:

if we take the limit c → cr + i0 ≡
U (yc) + i0 with y∗ = yc, then we recover the Fredholm equation for the singular eigenfunctions
from (37)–(38) with Ψ(y, cr + i0, yc) = ψ(y, cr) and ˜Ξ(c, yc) ≡ Ξ(c).

Similarly, we may recover the singular eigenfunction (19) from the Green function equation (27)

in the same limit: we let c → cr + i0 ≡ U (yc) + i0 in (32), giving

˜ǫ(cr + i0, yc) = ˜Ξ(cr + i0, yc) −

U ′′(y)Ψ(y, cr + i0, yc)
U (y) − cr − i0

dy.

Z

However, since Ψ(y, c, y∗) is analytic in the upper half plane, there exists a generalized form of the
Plemelj relation (e.g. [16]), which leads to

˜ǫ(cr + i0, yc) = Ξ(cr) − P

on using the association of the Fredholm equations to replace Ψ(y, cr + i0, yc) with ψ(y, cr). The
Plemelj relation also implies that

ω(y, cr + i0, yc) = P

U ′′ψ(y, cr)
U − cr
Finally, we identify ω(y, cr + i0, yc) with ω(y, cr), ˜ǫ(cr, yc) with ǫ(cr), and ˜ǫr(cr, yc) with λ(c)/U ′
c.
With these associations understood, we will drop the tildes in the next section and the extra
argument in yc.

+ ˜ǫr(cr, yc)δ(y − yc).

(42)

Note that we could take a completely diﬀerent approach to the problem beginning from the
Green function. First we select ˜Ξ(c, y∗) to be a function that is suitably analytic in c. Then,
the solution of the integral equation (37) can be shown to have the various analyticity properties
we have found for Ψ(y, c, y∗) by using Fredholm theory (the kernel is an analytic function of the
parameter c in the upper half plane). From there, we build the quantity ˜ǫ(c, y∗), which we know
has zeros if c is an eigenvalue. Moreover, equation (34) determines a function C(c, y∗) by which we
may relate the solution of the integral problem to the solutions Φ< and Φ> used above.

The only ﬂy in the ointment is the possibility of a homogeneous solution to the Fredholm
problem for some value of c, in which case the particular solution we seek is unbounded. From
Fredholm theory we know that the solution Ψ is not analytic at this value of c, and, in fact, has a
pole.

However, this nonanalyticity is evidently an artifact of solving the Fredholm problem, since the
solutions Φ< and Φ> are analytic in c. Moreover, since they are related to the solution Ψ of (37)
simply by the factor C(c, y∗) as in equation (25), it is clear that the nonanalyticity in Ψ(y, c, y∗)
is equivalent to a pole in C(c, y∗). But since we may choose ˜Ξ(c, y∗) to be analytic, the pole must
arise from a zero in the denominator of (34). This is the advertized interpretation of the poles in
C(c, y∗); they correspond to the presence of a homogeneous solution to the Fredholm problem (37).
At this stage, two remarks are in order. We have already noted that there are no homogeneous
solutions for c in the ﬂow domain in the context of the singular eigenfunction equation. Hence,
C(c, y∗) must be real and contain no poles for these values of c. Secondly, since this nonanalyticity
is Ψ(y, c, y∗) is purely an artifact of solving the Fredholm problem (37), we can take a slightly
diﬀerent tack and make a judicous choice for ˜Ξ(c, y∗) that avoids the problem. Again, this is just a

11

choice like ˜Ξ = D(c, y∗), where D(c, y∗) is the Fredholm determinent of the kernel in (37). Once we
make this choice, we may derive a solution of the integral equation that is analytic in c in the upper
half plane, and use it to build the dispersion relation through ˜ǫ(c, y∗). However, we will explicitly
follow the route outlined earlier in this section rather than this Green-function based avenue.

5 Nyquist method

In the previous section we discussed the functions ǫ(c) and W (c), and their relationship. If their
exists a discrete value of the phase velocity, c = cD, such that W (cD) = 0, then we have an
exponentially growing eigenmode with growth rate, Im(kcD). By construction we know that W (c)
is analytic for c in the upper half plane, and that it also has a branch cut along the real axis
between U1 := U (−1) and U2 := U (+1). This branch cut arises from that of the natural logarithm
of the Frobenius solution and the matching procedure (cf. (75) of the Appendix.) Because of these
properties we begin with W in our analysis below, but in the end we express the ﬁnal result in
terms of ǫ, a quantity that is by design reminiscent of the dispersion relation of Vlasov theory.

The Nyquist method relies upon the argument principle of complex analysis. In the present

context this principle implies that the integral,

1
2πi

C
Z

W ′(c)
W (c)

dc

(43)

(44)

counts the number of zeros of W in the region enclosed by a closed contour C in the c−plane. We
choose C to run along the cr axis, with ci ﬁxed to an arbitrarily small positive value, and then the
contour is closed by a large semicircular portion as shown in Fig. 2. As the radius of the semicircle
goes to inﬁnity, (43) gives the number of exponentially growing eigenvalues. Equivalently, (43) is
the number of times the path determined by the function W (c) encircles the origin of the (Wr, Wi)
plane as c completes a circuit of C.

It is eﬃcacious to decompose the integral (43) into the following two pieces:

The ﬁrst integral is all important, while the second is relatively minor. To understand this recall
Howard’s semicircle theorem [8], which states that the zeros of W must lie within a disk of radius,
(U1 + U2)/2, centered at the point (U2 − U1)/2 (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Hence, if C encloses the
semicircle, it contains all of the unstable eigenvales. In fact, wherever W is analytic, we may deform
the contour C′. Since W is analytic in the upper half plane we may deform C′ into any contour
there that connects W (U1 + i0) to W (U2 + i0) The important point is that since C′ is deformable
to any other contour lying outside Howard’s semicircle, the path deﬁned by W (c) as c varies along
C′ cannot lead to a new enclosure of the origin because this would mean a zero of W outside the
semicircle. In other words, the count of unstable eigenvales must be independent of the integration
around C′; the only importance of the integral over C′ is to complete a closed path in the (Wr, Wi)
plane without encircling the origin. In the Appendix we demonstrate this explicitly by extending
the contour C′ to inﬁnity and then by analyzing the image of its various pieces in the W -plane. The
upshot is that we may ignore the C′ part of the contour: the change in the argument of W along
the ﬂow domain is equal to the number of times the function W (c) encircles the origin, which is
equal to the number of unstable eigenvalues.

The contour C′ is C with the piece along the ﬂow domain, 5 → 7, removed. The contour H (dashed)
is Howard’s semicircle, within which the unstable eigenvalues must lie.

In Section 4 we showed that ǫ and W are related by ǫ(c) = C(c) W (c). But as c traverses the

ﬂow domain:

Now, as remarked at the end of Section 4, C(c) is real and ﬁnite along this part of the contour.
Hence, equating imaginary parts gives ∆arg[ǫ] = ∆arg[W ].

Therefore, the number of unstable eigenvalues is determined by the change in the argument of

the following quantity:

(47)

(48)

(49)

where cr = U (yc) (and we have explicitly made the choice Ξ(c) = 1), which is the “Nyquist function”
of Eq. (2). As cr varies from U1 to U2, or equivalently, yc from −1 to 1, ǫ(cr) executes a closed path
in the (ǫr, ǫi) plane. This path begins and ends at (1, 0) since ψ(±1, c) = 0. In between, the path
circulates around and the following considerations help us determine whether or not the origin is
encircled.

The path can only cross the ǫr−axis at the points for which ǫi = 0, or ψ(yc, cr)U ′′(yc) = 0.
However, as noted at the end of Section 3, ψ(yc, cr) cannot vanish. Hence the crossing points

13

are just the inﬂection points of the velocity proﬁle. We denote these by yI, with U ′′(yI ) = 0 and
c = cI = U (yI ). Thus, the path emerges from the point (1, 0) on the (ǫr, ǫi) plane, circulates around
crossing the ǫr−axis as many times as there are inﬂection points, and then terminates at (1, 0).
If the origin is encircled, we have an exponentially growing instability. Hence, by calculating the
singular eigenfunctions from the Fredholm problem (24) and then constructing ǫ(cr + i0), we can
determine if there is an unstable eigenvalue.

In fact, the path can only enclose the origin if there is at least one crossing point to the left of

the origin. Such a crossing point is guaranteed if

(50)

Z
for at least one of the inﬂection points.

Inequality (50) is actually a suﬃcient condition for instability. We see this as follows: if there
are an odd number of crossings to the left of the origin, then (50) certainly guarantees an enclosure
of the origin. But if there are an even number, then one can envision paths that cross to the left
of the origin, but do not enclose it. In this case, (50) may still hold, but the locus fails to encircle
the origin. However, the condition still predicts instability because we may yet vary k, and the
path must change continuously as we change k. From the Fredholm problem, one can observe that
ψ ∼ 1/k for large k. This means that ψ → 0 as k → ∞. Thus for large enough k, the path of
ǫ shrinks about the point (1, 0). Since varying k also cannot destroy crossing points, it must be
the case that there is a range of values of k for which two of the crossing points must straddle the
origin, and the path encircles it. (An example exhibiting this feature is given in Section 7.3.)

Thus (50) guarantees an enclosure of the origin for some value of k, and for any number of
crossings to the left of the origin. In other words, we deduce the following necessary and suﬃcient
condition for instability:

Rayleigh’s equation possess an unstable eigenmode if and only if there exists a wavenum-
ber, k, and at least one inﬂection point, yI, such that Eq. (50) holds.

Note that, by “crossing point” we mean strictly only those inﬂection points for which U ′′′ 6= 0.
This implies that intersection of the path with the axis leads to a traversal of the axis from one
half plane to the other. Inﬂection points for which U ′′′ = 0 can lead to the path touching but not
crossing the axis, and these intersections will not signify a nearby enclosure of the origin. However,
an arbitrarily small deformation of U (y) can in this situation lead to the locus encircling the origin.
Thus proﬁles with U ′′′ = 0 correspond to marginally stable states (see Section 7).

Unfortunately, the suﬃcient condition implied by (50) has a more complicated dependence on k
than in the related Vlasov problem (the k−dependence in the Vlasov problem is contained purely
in a multiplicative factor). The dependence here comes from the dependence of ψ(y, cI ) on k, which
m := −Min [U ′′/(U − cI )] for all of the inﬂexion points yI ,
is not obvious. Nevertheless, if k2 > k2
then we can apply a result of Howard [17] which indicates that there can be no instability. Hence
for k > km, the crossing point must lie to the right of the origin, so we can at least bound the range
of interesting wavenumbers from above.

Finally, the condition (50) refers only to exponentially growing eigenmodes and, therefore,
does not encompass all the possibilities for instability. It fails to account for a possible algebraic
instability of the continuous spectrum. However, in the present context, we can safely ignore such a
possibility since we know that the continuum is stable for a monotonic velocity proﬁle [9]. Therefore,

14

algebraic instability is ruled out. Hence (50) is the encompassing condition for instability. This
may not be true if the proﬁle is nonmonotonic (see [18]).

6 Special cases

In the previous section we described our necessary and suﬃcient condition for instability; here we
illustrate our criterion for two special examples: general proﬁles with k = 0, and an asymptotic
result.

6.1 General k = 0 eigenmodes

For an arbitrary proﬁle with k = 0, Rayleigh’s equation simpliﬁes and the eigenmodes can be found
by directly integrating. It is straightforward to construct the Wronskian,

W (c) = (U2 − c)(c − U1)

−1

Z

dy
(U − c)2 .

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

We could analyze this dispersion relation independently of the machinery developed in the previous
sections. However, we consider the k = 0 problem by way of illustration, and so we apply the general
methodology.

The Fredholm problem (or the procedure of Section 4) for the streamfunctions of the singular

eigenfunctions has in this case the analytical solution:

ψ(y, c) =

(cid:26)

−(U2 − c)(c − U1)(U2 − U1)−1U ′

In the Nyquist construction, the important piece of the contour C leaves the point (1, 0), executes
some path that is dependent on the details of U (y), and ﬁnally returns to (1, 0). That is, the path
is closed, as we remarked earlier. The Nyquist function of (53) is related to that obtained in [5],
where this special case of k = 0 was considered in a more speciﬁc fashion. Note, however, that
the Nyquist function of [5] diﬀers from (53) by a factor in front of the integral that leads to ǫ(c)
vanishing at c = U1 and U2. If this were not so, our Nyquist plots would not be closed loops and
one would be forced to consider the neglected piece of the contour, C ′, in detail.

6.2 An asymptotic result

Our second example is only an approximate result; it concerns velocity proﬁles of the form, U (y) =
y + ε2U(y/ε), where ε ≪ 1. This kind of velocity proﬁle represents a linear background proﬁle with
a superposed, sharply varying, “defect.” To leading order in ε, the corresponding streamfunction
is given by

ψ(y, c) = G(y, yc) + O(ε),

Vlasov solution.

Note that in the two examples, U (y) need not be analytic on [−1, 1]; in fact, the existence of

two derivatives is suﬃcient.

7 Numerical solutions for sample proﬁles

We now construct some Nyquist plots numerically for a trio of sample proﬁles that illustrate diﬀerent
features of the inviscid stability problem.

7.1 Single inﬂection point

The proﬁle,

U (y) = tanh βy,

(60)

is an example of an equilibrium with a single inﬂection point. Nyquist plots for various values of k
and β = 2 are drawn in Fig. 1(a). For wavenumbers k < kc with kc ≃ 1.832, there is evidentally an
unstable eigenvalue, since the Nyquist plots enclose the origin over this range of k. Plots for k = 0
and diﬀerent values of β are shown in Fig. 1(b).

In Fig. 1(a), the Nyquist plot passes through the origin without encircling it for the critical
value k = kc. This wavenumber is the demarcation between stability and instability; that is, it is
the stability boundary, kc = kc(β). This stability boundary is displayed in Fig 3(a). As β decreases,
the critical wavenumber decreases until it vanishes at a special value of β = βm ≃ 1.2. For the
proﬁle with this critical parameter value, the k = 0 Nyquist plot passes through the origin and
none encircle it. In other words, such a proﬁle is a marginally stable state.

This feature of the proﬁle is an example of a general result: instability always sets in ﬁrst at
k = 0 for proﬁles with a single inﬂection point (e.g. [8]). Hence the instability condition is given
by ǫr < 0 with ǫr given by Eq. (54). This is equivalent to the result of [5].

In some applications, however, one may be interested in ﬂows that are periodic in x (such as
in annular or spherical geometry, or in numerical simulations). In these cases, there is a minimum
wavenumber, and k = 0 is neither accessible nor relevant. Hence the k = 0 theory is not applicable
even for a single inﬂexion point.
In this circumstance one must deal with the general Nyquist
function and suﬃcient stability condition described in Section 5.

7.2 Multiple inﬂection points

The proﬁle,

U (y) = y +

sin γy,

1
2γ

(61)

is an example in which there are multiple inﬂection points. In this case, the number of inﬂection
points varies with γ. For γ = 5, 7.5, and 10, there are 3, 5, and 7 inﬂecton points, respectively. As
γ increases, the new inﬂexion points appear in pairs through the boundaries, y = ±1. The Nyquist
plots at the three parameter values and k = 1 are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). For these plots there are
multiple encirclings of the origin, signifying multiple instabilities. For example, when k = 1 and
γ = 10, there are three loops around the origin (see Fig. 4(c)). As γ increases and inﬂexion points
appear at the boundaries, the Nyquist curve acquires more loops that appear out of the asymptote
(1, 0).

At γ = 10, there are therefore three unstable eigenvalues with k = 1, which is the most this
proﬁle can support (four of the inﬂection points lead to crossing of the ǫr−axis, but these lie to the
right of the asymptote (1, 0)). Note that the antisymmetry of the proﬁle means that the path of
ǫ(cr + i0) is symmetric under reﬂection about the ǫr−axis.

If we vary k, and calculate ǫr(cI ), where cI with I = 1, 2, 3 denotes the three inﬂection points
that lead to crossings to the left of the asymptote (1,0), then we obtain the picture shown in
Fig. 4(d). This shows that the ǫr(cI ) increase monotonically with k. This suggests that if we were
to vary γ, then all three unstable eigenvalues would appear ﬁrst at k = 0, which is indeed true as
can be seen from Fig. 3(b). Thus, the marginal state for this proﬁle is again given by the k = 0
theory.

7.3 Finite wavenumber instabilities

The third proﬁle,

U (y) = y + 5y3 + f tanh 4(y − 1/2),

(62)

contains one or three inﬂection points, depending on the value of the parameter f . More speciﬁcally,
as we increase f through about 1.59, we create two inﬂection points near the point y = 0.6 (see
Fig. 5). The critical proﬁle for which the two inﬂection points emerge contains a point with
U ′′ = U ′′′ = 0. This leads to a Nyquist plot that contains a nontransversal intersection of the path
with the ǫr−axis; that is, the plot touches the axis but does not cross it. For larger values of f ,
this degenerate point splits into the two inﬂection points and the plot crosses the ǫr−axis twice.
Nyquist plots beyond this bifurcation are shown in Fig. 6(b).

This kind of a change to the proﬁle leads to a situation in which there can be two crossings of
the ǫr−axis to the left of the origin, but in neighborhood of k = 0 there are no unstable eigenvalues.
Yet, as we remarked in Section 5, increasing k leads to a deformation of the path such that the
origin is eventually encircled for some range of k (see Fig. 6(a) and (b)). In Fig. 7, we show the

variation of ǫr with k for the two newly created inﬂection points at f = 1.62; the range of unstable
wavenumbers is 0.12 <∼ k <∼ 1.31. Again the variation of ǫr with k is monotonic.

The onset of the unstable band arises at the value of f for which the two inﬂection points
emerge; that is, this proﬁle is the marginally stable state. Moreover, the critical value of k is that
required to make the nontranversal intersection of the path with the ǫr−axis occur at the origin.
Thus the emergence of the two inﬂection points as we raise f leads to an instability with an onset
at ﬁnite wavenumber, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Thus, in this case, instability is bounded away from
k = 0, in contrast to the previous examples. (This particular example is somewhat analogous to
the bump-on-tail instability in the Vlasov problem [4]).

In both Figs. 4(d) and 7, ǫr appears to be a monotonically increasing function of k. If this
feature were generally true, then the deformation of the Nyquist plots as we vary k would certainly
be simpler to understand. Indeed, this would imply that ǫr(cI ) < 0 evaluated at k = 0 was suﬃcient
for instability, independently of the number of inﬂection points (at least for monotonic, analytic
proﬁles). However, we have found no argument implying such a property of ǫr, and doubt one
exists.

8 Closing remarks

We have presented in this paper a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the instability of monotonic
shear ﬂows. Several examples of equilibrium velocity proﬁles were treated in Sections 6 and 7,
demonstrating that the condition is of practical utility for ﬁnding instability and for understanding
the kinds of bifurcations that can occur.

One may ask the question of how the method we have presented, which entails solving a Fred-
holm integral equation, compares with directly calculating the solutions numerically. Without the
Nyquist method, one could solve Rayleigh’s equation in order to locate unstable modes with a given
k for c in the complex plane. This amounts to solving a boundary value problem with singular
points. With this procedure one would repeatedly solve Rayleigh’s equation at diﬀerent values of
(complex) c and employ some kind of two-dimensional searching technique in order to ﬁnd the
eigenvalues. Whilst not especially diﬃcult, this approach is computationally intensive, and in our
opinion is neither elegant nor insightful. As a computational exercise, the calculation of the Nyquist
function is substantially less eﬀort than solving the boundary-value problem in this fashion. The
Nyquist recipe is simpler because numerically it only requires a matrix inversion and only values of
c on the real axis are involved. Moreover, the suﬃcient condition of (50) requires one computation
per inﬂection point, for each value of k, and no search in the complex plane.

In addition to these computational advantages, the Nyquist method provides insight into inviscid
instability. It allows one to determine the number of unstable eigenmodes of a proﬁle, as indicated,
for example, by the multiple encircling of the origin of the Nyquist plots of Fig. 4. Also, it leads
us to understand the various kinds of bifurcations to instability of a family of shear ﬂow proﬁles.
Put another way, Nyquist theory tells us how we can construct proﬁles with certain kinds of
instabilities. For example, with the Nyquist imagery, we know how to build proﬁles that suﬀer the
onset of instability at ﬁnite wavenumber, as in Section 7.3. Without this machinery, it would be
much more diﬃcult even formulating the problem of how to fashion the needed U (y).

The bifurcations considered here are ones in which unstable eigenvalues appear out of a con-
tinuous spectrum. It is important to distinguish this kind of bifurcation from those that occur in
systems with only discrete spectra, since any stable proﬁle is arbitrarily close (in Lp norm) to an

22

unstable one (this is the essence of Gill’s result [20] for Couette ﬂow), a feature intimately linked
with the presence of the continuous spectrum. It would then appear that catagorizing bifurcations
to instability is problematic. However, the Nyquist plots in the (ǫr, ǫi)−plane provide a measure
of how close a given equilibrium is from being deformed to one at the onset of instability. This
onset may be through k = 0 (cf. Figs. 1 and 4) or at ﬁnite wavenumber (cf. Fig. 6). Indeed, it can
occur via more degenerate kinds of bifurcations, and these may be visualized straightforwardly with
Nyquist theory. In fact, it is only the unclear dependence on k that prevents us from immediately
classifying every instability of a proﬁle with a given number of inﬂection points (cf. [19]).

An example of the kind of insight provided by the Nyquist method is given by the following
general result: for given k, in order to encircle the origin, the path must cross the ǫr−axis twice.
That is, in order to create a new instability we need two new inﬂection points. Thus, if there are
N inﬂection points in the proﬁle (and so there are N + 1 crossing of the ǫr−axis altogether), there
can be at most (N + 1)/2 unstable eigenmodes with that value of k. This result, which builds on
a theorem of Howard [17], was stated without proof in [21].

In ﬁnite dimensional Hamiltonian systems bifurcations are regulated by Krein’s theorem, which
states that a necessary condition for the bifurcation to instability is that colliding eigenvalues possess
energy signatures of opposite sign. It is also know for Hamiltonian systems that the constancy of
energy can be used to obtain a suﬃcient but not necessary condition for stability. The results of this
paper lend insight to and can be interpreted in the Hamiltonian context: the suﬃcient condition
for stability based on energy is equivalent to the conditions of Rayleigh and Fjørtoft, and a version
of Krein’s theorem (and a notion of signature) for bifurcations involving the continuous spectra can
be related to the Nyquist function [15].

We conclude with some remarks about the assumptions we made on the forms of the proﬁle.
The analytic structure of the Nyquist function heavily relies on the analytic form of the proﬁle in
the vicinity of [−1, 1]. However, irrespective of the form of U (y), we may nevertheless construct
ǫ(cr). In fact, the zeros of this function for cr ∈ [−1, 1] still point to the existence of regular neutral
eigenmodes even when U (y) is not analytic. What is no longer clear is how to continue ǫ oﬀ the
real axis. Or equivalently, whether there are discrete complex modes at nearby parameter values.
Nevertheless there are various hints in this work that suggest that the theory works even if U (y)
has only two derivatives.

Finally, nonmonotonicity of U (y) brings in the new complications of multiple critical layers for
a given wave speed, and unusual properties of the streamfunction for critical layers lying at the
shearless points where U ′(y) = 0. It is for these reasons that the theory does not immediately carry
over. We are currently working on these and other extensions.

Appendix

In this appendix we show that the change in the argument of the Wronskian is determined entirely
by the piece of the contour C that is along the ﬂow domain (5 → 7 of Fig. 2); the remainder of the

23

contour will be shown to not encircle the origin.

The big semicircle: 1 → 2 → 3.

On the big semicircle c = Reiθ with θ ∈ (0, π). We consider the limit R = |c| → ∞ by invoking
the principle of permanence (see e.g. [22]), which in the present context simply states that the
limit c → ∞ of the solution to Rayleigh’s equation at ﬁxed y is equal to the solution of the
c → ∞ limit of Rayleigh’s equation. The latter limit is ψ′′ − k2ψ = 0, which has the following
solution with the appropriate boundary conditions: Φ∞
< (y) := sinh[k(y + 1)]/k. The principle
of permanence implies Φ<(y, c → ∞) = Φ∞
< (y), and thus using W (c) = −Φ<(1, c) we obtain
limR→∞ W (c) = − sinh(2k)/k < 0. Therefore, the piece of the contour 1 → 2 → 3 maps into the
W -plane as a single point on the negative real axis (this is the asymptote (1, 0) on the ǫ−plane).
< (1, c) = 2. (This is clearly correct
since Rayleigh’s equation becomes ψ′′ = 0 and the assumed boundary conditions imply ψ = 1 + y,
which when evaluated at y = 1 gives 2.) Deﬁning F (c) := W (c)/[(U2 − c)(c − U1)] gives F (c, 0) ∼
2e−2iθ/R2, which is consistent with the k = 0 result of [5].

As a check consider the limit k → 0. Observe limk→0 Φ∞

The principle of permanence can be demonstrated explicitly by using the solution to Rayleigh’s

equation written as ψ(y, c) =

n=0 ψn(y, c), where

Using Cauchy’s inequality, it is not diﬃcult to prove that this series converges uniformly for all
y 6= yc. If we choose ψ0 so that the boundary conditions of (2) are satisﬁed, evaluate (63) at y = 1,
and slip the c → ∞ limit through the integral sign, then we obtain Φ∞

< (y).

As an aside, note that each ψn is analytic in c. Thus because of uniform convergence, ψ(1, c)
is analytic for c 6= U (1). This is true even for proﬁles U (y) that are not analytically continuable
into the complex plane; it is only necessary for the integral in (63) to exist to get analyticity in
c. This puts a relatively mild restriction on U . For example, if c is not in the ﬂow domain, then
yU ′′(y) ∈ L1[−1, 1] is suﬃcient.

The exterior legs: 3 → 4 and 8 → 1.

We show below that if c is not in the ﬂow domain, which is the case on the legs 3 → 4 and 8 → 1
neither Φ<(y, c) nor Φ>(y, c) can vanish. Evaluating Φ< at y = 1 we see the same is true for W .
We also include a proof that W is a monotonic functions of c on 3 → 4 and 8 → 1. Thus these
pieces of the contour map into curves that cannot cross into the right hand portion of the W -plane.
To prove the above statements we use a formula introduced by Green in the ﬁrst half of the

nineteenth century (see e.g. [22] or [10]). For Rayleigh’s equation, Green’s formula is

real and outside the domain of integration.

for all y ∈ (−1, 1] and c /∈ [U1, U2]. This inequality means that neither factor can vanish for y in the
interior of the ﬂow domain. We know that Φ<(−1, c) = 0 and that Φ′
<(−1, c) = 1, and therefore in
a neighborhood of y = −1, by continuity of the solution, Φ<(y, c) > 0. Thus Φ<(y, c) > 0 for all
]-factor must also be positive. (Note that neither
y ∈ (−1, 1], and inequality (65) implies that the [
factor can be singular by the existence theorem applied to Rayleigh’s equation.) We mention, for
later use, that a similar argument shows Φ>(y, c) > 0.

Evaluating Φ< at y = 1 yields W (c) = −Φ<(1, c) < 0 for all c ∈ (−∞, U1), which is our desired
result for the leg 3 → 4. Similarly, W (c) < 0 for all c ∈ (U2, ∞), our desired result for the leg
8 → 1.

We now further demonstrate that W is monotonic, although this is not strictly needed for the

proof. To this end we diﬀerentiate Rayleigh’s equation with respect to c, yielding

Clearly for c /∈ (U1, U2), µ(c) > 0. The [
]-factor of (65), which
we showed is positive. Since U ′(y) > 0 and Φ>(y) > 0, for y ∈ [−1, 1), we see that K(c) > 0. Thus
we have established monotonicity: ∂Φ<(1, c, k)/∂c > 0 or ∂W (c, k)/∂c < 0 for c /∈ (U1, U2).

The boundary regions: 4 → 5 and 7 → 8.

Now we consider the pieces of the contour that skirt the boundaries of the ﬂow domain. These are
the pieces 4 → 5 and 7 → 8 of Fig. 2. We use the expressions ψg and ψb of (16) and (17) to construct
Φ<(y, c) according to the procedure described in Section 4. Upon enforcing the boundary conditions
as described in that section, it is not diﬃcult to show that the Wronskian has the following form:

W (c) = −Φ<(1, c) = χ1(c)(U1 − c) + χ2(c)(U2 − c)

+ (U2 − c)(U1 − c)[χ3(c) ln(U1 − c) + χ4(c) ln(U2 − c)] ,

(75)

where the functions χi for i = 1 − 4 are analytic functions of c. The piece 4 → 5 can be pulled down
into a little semicircle on which c = U1 + δeiθ, where δ > 0 and θ ∈ (−π, 0), which is still consistent
with c being in the upper half plane. Evidently, limδ→0 W (c) = χ2(U1)(U2 − U1). Since this piece
of the contour must connect to the piece that terminates at 4 as 3 → 4, it follows that the piece of
the contour 4 → 5 maps into a point on the negative real axis of the W -plane. Similarly, on 7 → 8,
where c = U2 + δeiθ, δ > 0, and θ ∈ (−π, 0), we obtain limδ→0 W (c) = χ1(U2)(U1 − U2), and the
piece of the contour 7 → 8 maps into a point on the negative real axis of the W -plane.

So in conclusion, since we have proven that for c ∈ C′ the real part of W is negative, the only
part of the contour that can give rise to a change in the argument of W is the piece from 5 → 7.

Figure 1: Nyquist plots for the single inﬂection point proﬁle, U (y) = tanh βy. (a) Four plots for
β = 2 and k = 0, 1, and 2, and the critical value for the onset of instability, k = kc ≃ 1.832
(dashed curve). (b) Four plots for k = 0 and β = 1, 1.5, and 2, and the critical value for the
onset of instability, β = βc ≃ 1.2 (dashed curve).

Figure 2: The contours C, C′, and H in the c-plane. The closed contour C runs the entire circuit
from 1 → 2 → . . . → 8 → 1, with the portion from 3 → 1 lifted inﬁnitesimally above the real
axis. The contour C′ is C with the piece along the ﬂow domain, 5 → 7, removed. The contour
H (dashed) is Howard’s semicircle, within which the unstable eigenvalues must lie.

Figure 3: Stability boundaries for the three equilibrium proﬁles of Sec. 7. Figures (a) and (b)
depict the nucleation of instability through k = 0, while (c) depicts the nucleation of instability
through k 6= 0. In (b), the stability boundary of the second and third unstable modes is also
shown.

Figure 4: Nyquist plots for the multiple inﬂection point proﬁle, U (y) = y + (sin γy)/2γ, with
k = 1. (a) The case γ = 5 has one encircling of the origin and thus one unstable eigenvalue.
(b) In the case with γ = 7.5 two more loops have appeared and the curve almost encircles the
origin two more times. That is, it is close to the threshold of the instability of two further
modes. (c) The case γ = 10 has three encirclings of the origin and three unstable eigenvalues.
(d) Depiction of the monotonic dependence of the crossing values to the left of the asymptote
(1,0) as a function of k.

Figure 5: Vorticity and vorticity gradient proﬁles corresponding to the velocity proﬁle U (y) =
y + 5y3 + f tanh 4(y − 1/2) with equilibrium parameter values f = 1.3, f = 1.65, and f = 2.
At f = fc ≈ 1.59 two inﬂection points emerge.

Figure 6: (a) Nyquist plots for the proﬁle U (y) = y + 5y3 + f tanh 4(y − 1/2) for k = 0, 0.75, and

1.5, and f = 1.62. (b) Magniﬁcation that indicates the onset of instability through k 6= 0.

Figure 7: Plots of ǫr(cI ) against k at f = 1.62, where cI , I = 1, 2, are the two inﬂection points

leading to crossings of the Nyquist plot in Fig. 6 to the left of the asymptote (1, 0).

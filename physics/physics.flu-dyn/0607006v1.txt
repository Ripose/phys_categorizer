The eigenfunctions of nested wells with incommensurate boundary geometry, in both hydrody-
namic shallow water regime and quantum cases, are systematically and exhaustively studied in this
letter. The boundary arrangement of the nested wells consist of polygonal ones, square or hexagonal,
with a concentric immersed similar but rotated well or plateau. A rich taxonomy of wave patterns,
such as quasicrystalline states, their crystalline rational approximants and some other exotic but
well known tilings, is found in these mimicked experiments. To our best knowledge, these hydro-
dynamic rational approximants are presented here for the ﬁrst time in a hydrodynamic-quantum
framework. The corresponding statistical nature of the energy level spacing distribution reﬂects this
taxonomy by changing the spectral types.

One would believe that a quasiperiodic wave pattern,
that has an orientational order without periodic trans-
lational symmetry [1], must be associated to an exter-
nal single connected boundary.
In such a case, classi-
cal analogues which model features of quantum systems,
and prove nontrivial properties of this last systems, have
stirred interest. For example, acoustic [2] and hydrody-
namic quasicrystals [3] were previously reported, and the
existence of Bloch-like states has recently been proved in
In all of these results, there was an

imposed global quasiperiodicity either by the boundary
conditions or a dynamical source, which makes the ap-
pearance of such patterns not so unexpected. However, it
is also possible to conﬁne quasicrystalline hydrodynamic
modes within an inner isolated region of a bigger sur-
face, as it was made in Ref.
[5]. In that work, the ex-
periment was realized under a linear regime and thus the
ﬂuid ”sees” a double concentric non-connected boundary.
Hence, it was essentially diﬀerent to other reported non-
linear quasicrystalline Faraday wave patterns [6] where
the pattern is not conditioned by the shape of the bound-
ary due to the non-linearity of the Faraday phenomenon.
Although Ref. [5] provided new insights into the exper-
imental generation of quasiperiodic patterns in the linear
regimen, unfortunately it does not fulﬁlls well the shallow
water approximation [7], i.e., in which the surface wave-

length is much larger than the liquid depth, making im-
possible to state a suitable hydrodynamic-quantum anal-
ogy. Since the quantum analogs of these conﬁned hydro-
dynamic modes may be of relevance to design quantum
conﬁnements echibiting quasiperiodic electronic states,
or their rational approximants, here we systematically
study the eigenfunctions corresponding to nested wells
under the shallow water regime, and their corresponding
quantum analogues. For this goal, we numerically solve
the hydrodynamic equation, which in this case turns out
to be the Helmholtz equation, and a thight binding ap-
proach is applied for the quantum case.

The nested wells of our study consist of a polygonal ex-
ternal boundary, square or hexagonal, with a concentric
similar but incommensurately rotated well or plateau. In
the case of the squares, the rotation angle between both
domains is 45◦, and in the case of the hexagons, this an-
gle is 30◦. The bottom of the vessel was covered with
a shallow liquid layer of depth h1, and the inner well or
plateau with a depth h2.

In the hydrodynamic study we use the equation:
t η(r, t) = ∇ · [gh(r)∇η(r, t)], [7] where η is the wave
∂2
amplitude, g is the acceleration due to gravity and h(r)
is the depth ﬁeld, being the corresponding Helmholtz

and its 3/2 rational approximant (right) in a double square
nested well. Simulation parameters are as follows. For the
quasicrystalline pattern, the well depth ratio is 1.16 and the
level energy, respect to the 50Hz ground state, is −0.349174.
For the rational approximant the well depth ratio is 1.1 and
the level energy is −0.2246.

ing wave, with the above mentioned adequate regions,
1 (outer) and 2 (inner), and ci are the phase velocities,
ω/ki = (ghi)1/2, ω is the angular frequency and k is the
wave number.

We calculate the square nested well for a depth ratio
h1/h2 = 0.9, 1.1, 0.77, and 1.3 respectively, with about
1700 eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions
exhaustively checked for each case. The hexagonal nested
well case is calculated for a depth ratio h1/h2 = 0.9 and
1.1, respectively, including about 1600 eigenvalues and
their corresponding eigenfunctions in both spectra. Due
to the high symmetry of the problem, a lot of doubly
degenerate states appear. Any eigenfunction of spectra
is available under request.

Since in the present r´egime it is possible to establish
an analogy with a quantum system, we also solve a tight-
binding equation as described elsewhere [5, 8], with the
same nested well geometry but providing it with a square
atomic lattice. The correspondences with the hydrody-
namic equations are the following:

Em,n = 4ghm,n/a2,

tm,n,m−1,n = tm,n,m+1,n = tm,n,m,n−1
= tm,n,m,n+1 = ghm,n/a2,

where Em,n is the potential energy at the atomic site
with integer lattice coordinates (m, n), hm,n is the liquid
depth at site (m, n), a2 = L2/N 2, where L is the length
of the external polygon side and N is the discretization
size (typically 201); and tm,n,m′,n′ is the hopping integral
between the nearest neighbour sites (m, n) and (m′, n′).
Finally, in the present analogy, the dispersion relation
corresponds to the equation: E = ω2a2/gh. Spectra with
7.000 and 10.000 eigenvalues were respectively explored.
As we shall see, we present here quasicrystalline wave
patterns and their lower rational approximants linked to
an hydrodynamic-quantum analogy problem. In Fig. 1,
we show a quantum octagonal quasicrystalline pattern
and its 3/2 rational approximant one. The ﬁrst pat-
tern is obtained under quantum boundary conditions,

FIG. 2: Hydrodynamic rational approximants of the octag-
onal pattern: 3/2 (left top) and 7/5 (right top). The edge-
lengths of the double square nested well are 80 and 35cm. In
both cases the depth ratio is 0.9 and the frequencies for each
case are 0.8376703Hz (3/2 approximant) and 0.9505245Hz
(7/5 approximant). Below each pattern, their corresponding
vibrational level distribution (VLD) are shown.

i.e., Dirichlet conditions, and the second one, although
it is also a quantum pattern, however it is obtained un-
der hydrodynamic boundary conditions, i.e., Neumann
conditions. Fig. 1 (left) conspicuously resembles to that
pioneer experimental octagonal pattern early published
in the very diﬀerent non linear Faraday wave context
by B. Christiansen, P. Alstrom and M. T. Levinsen [6]
(see Fig. 3(bottom) of this reference). A similar qua-
sicrystalline octagonal pattern as that shown in Fig.1
(left) is obtained under our present hydrodynamic frame-
work for a depth ratio of 0.9 and at an eigenfrequency of
f = ω/2π = 3.02632Hz.

The quasicrystalline octagonal pattern is generated
by using linear combinations of two square lattice
vector bases, shifted between them by an angle of
2 tan−1 (cid:0)21/2 − 1(cid:1). By changing 21/2 for its respective
rational approximant numbers obtained from the contin-
uous fraction expansion 21/2 = [1; ¯2], the approximant
patterns are generated. These wave vectors were accu-
rately obtained for each eigenfunction by means of its
corresponding pattern Fourier analysis.

In Fig.2 we also show both the hydrodynamic 3/2
rational approximant pattern and the 7/5 one with
their corresponding vibrational level distributions D(η0)
(VLD). The VLD is computationally obtained start-
ing from the expression: D(η0) = 1
Ω Rη=η0 (dl/|∇η(r)|),
where Ω is the area of the rational approximant unit cell.
By replacing the k-space by the real space, the above
mentioned vibrational level distribution plays the same
role in the corresponding eigenfunction as the well known
density of states (DOS) in the whole spectrum [9, 10].

In Fig.3, we show an exotic pattern resembling the β-
Mn structure (or σ-phase) which has been found coexist-
ing as a crystalline approximant with the octagonal qua-

ing level distributions. The quasicrystalline dodecagonal
wave pattern can be also generated using two ternary
wave vector sets shifted between them by an angle of
2 tan−1 (cid:0)2 − 31/2(cid:1). Their rational approximant patterns
appear when 31/2 transforms to its corresponding ratio-
nal approximant numbers. These rational numbers are
obtained starting from the continuous fraction expansion
31/2 = [1; 1, 2]. Fig.4 shows the 2 and 19/11 above men-
tioned rational approximant wave patterns. The VLD
of the ﬁrst pattern, or triangular pattern, is well known
[9, 10]. The spectral problem and the rich taxonomy
of eigenfunctions of this double-hexagonal experiment is
similar to that previously described for the double square
well.

As is well known [12], there is a relationship between
the geometry of the boundary, the eigenfunction nature
and the statistical properties of the spectrum. An in-
tegrable system, such as a polygonal billiard [13], has
a statistical distribution of energy spectral ﬂuctuations
(P (s)), where s is the distance between nearest energy
levels, that ﬁts the Poisson distribution.
In Fig.5, we
show that this is case for the P (s) of the system under the
symmetric conﬁguration of the nested wells. If the sym-
metry of such system is broken, by slightly rotating and
shifting the inner well, then all the inherent degenera-
cies are removed as it was made in a similar early study
[14]. In such a case, the eigenfunctions show ”scarred”
localized surface waves [15] as shown in Fig.6, and P (s)
becomes a semi-Poisson distribution.

We have shown that a geometrical arrangement of two
nested wells, each of them with polygonal symmetry, can
give a very rich and complex behavior even if a sim-
ple linear diﬀerential equation, valid for hydrodynamics
and quantum mechanics, is used as physical description.
Quasiperiodic, approximant and periodic wave patterns
have been obtained in this work. The present approach
gave a new insight on how to generate certain rational
approximants in the density wave framework. The ob-

sicrystalline phase [11]. As Fourier analysed in this work,
this pattern grows spontaneously in this mimicked exper-
iment with the same wave vectors of the 3/2 rational ap-
proximant one but introducing the phase 2 arctan(1/2)
in a couple of non-orthogonal vectors of the correspond-
ing 4D basis. The phasing out transforms the VLD of
the pattern, as shown in Fig. 3(right), making it similar
to that of the well known square lattice case [9, 10]. It
is remarkable that the present hydrodynamic experiment
can give insight about a basic crystallographic structural
problem. To the authors best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
time that the σ-phase is described in the density wave
framework.

In a similar scenario, Fig.4 shows two patterns gen-
erated in a hexagonal nested well and their correspond-

decagonal 19/11 rational approximant (right). The edge-
lengths of the double hexagonal nested well are 40 and 17.5cm
respectively. The depth ratio and frequency for each case are:
1.1, 0.8155099Hz (triangular) and 0.9, 2.2416974Hz (19/11
approximant). Below each pattern, their corresponding VLD
are shown.

tained wave patterns in both symmetrical and chaotic
cases.

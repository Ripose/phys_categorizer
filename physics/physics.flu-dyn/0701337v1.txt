The dynamics of transition to turbulence in plane Couette ﬂow

D. Viswanath ∗

January 2007

Abstract

In plane Couette ﬂow, the incompressible ﬂuid between two plane parallel walls is driven by
the motion of those walls. The laminar solution, in which the streamwise velocity varies linearly
in the wall-normal direction, is known to be linearly stable at all Reynolds numbers (Re). Yet,
in both experiments and computations, turbulence is observed for Re & 360.

In this article, we show that when the laminar ﬂow is perturbed on to the transition thresh-
old, the ﬂow approaches either steady or traveling wave solutions. These solutions exhibit some
aspects of turbulence but are not fully turbulent even at Re = 4000. However, these solutions
are linearly unstable and ﬂows that evolve along their unstable directions become fully turbulent.
The solution approached by a threshold perturbation depends upon the nature of the perturba-
tion. Surprisingly, the positive eigenvalue that corresponds to one family of solutions decreases
in magnitude with increasing Re, with the rate of decrease given by Reα with α ≈ −0.46.

Introduction

The classical problem of transition to turbulence in ﬂuids has not been fully solved in spite of
attempts spread over more than a century. Transition to turbulence manifests itself in a simple and
compelling way in experiments. For instance, in the pipe ﬂow experiment of Reynolds (see [1]), a
dye injected at the mouth of the pipe extended in “a beautiful straight line through the tube” at
low velocities or low Reynolds numbers (Re). The line would shift about at higher velocities, and
at yet higher velocities the color band would mix up with the surrounding ﬂuid all at once at some
point down the tube.

A wealth of evidence shows that the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation gives a good descrip-
tion of ﬂuid turbulence. Therefore one ought to be able to understand the transition to turbulence
using solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation. However, the nature of the solutions of the Navier-
Stokes equation is poorly understood. Thus the problem of transition to turbulence is fascinating
both physically and mathematically.

The focus of this paper is on plane Couette ﬂow. In plane Couette ﬂow, the ﬂuid is driven by
two plane parallel walls. If the ﬂuid is driven too hard, the ﬂow becomes turbulent. Such wall
driven turbulence occurs in many practical situations such as near the surface of moving vehicles
and is technologically important.

The two parallel walls are assumed to be at y = ±1. The walls move in the x or streamwise
direction with velocities equal to ±1. The z direction is called the spanwise direction. The Reynolds
number is a dimensionless constant obtained as Re = U L/ν, where U is half the diﬀerence of the
wall velocities, L is half the separation between the walls, and ν is the viscosity of the ﬂuid. The
velocity of the ﬂuid is denoted by u = (u, v, w), where u, v, w are the streamwise, wall-normal, and
spanwise components.

For the laminar solution, v = w = 0 and u = y. The laminar solution is linearly stable for all
Re. As shown by Kreiss and others [6], perturbations to the laminar solution that are bounded
in amplitude by O(Re−21/4) decay back to the laminar solution. However, in experiments and in
computations, turbulent spots are observed around Re = 360 [2]. The transition to turbulence in
such experiments must surely be because of the ﬁnite amplitude of the disturbances. By a threshold
disturbance, we refer to a disturbance that would lead to transition if it were slightly ampliﬁed
but which would relaminarize if slightly attenuated. The concept of the threshold for transition to
turbulence was introduced by Trefethen and others [12]. The amplitude of the threshold disturbance
depends upon the type of the disturbance. It is believed to scale with Re at a rate given by Reα
for some α <= −1.

Our main purpose is to explain how certain ﬁnite amplitude disturbances of the laminar solution
lead to turbulence. The dynamical picture that will be developed in this paper is illustrated in
Figure 1. Historically, the laminar solution itself has been the focus of attempts to understand
mechanisms for transition. Our focus however will be on a diﬀerent solution that is represented
as an empty oval in Figure 1. Depending upon the type of disturbance, this solution could either
be a steady solution or a traveling wave. Those solutions are not laminar in nature. Neither are
they fully turbulent even at high Re. Unlike the laminar solution, these quasi-turbulent solutions
are linearly unstable. The quasi-turbulent solutions remain at an O(1) distance from the laminar
solution, while the threshold amplitudes decrease with Re as indicated already. Therefore the
threshold disturbances are too tiny to perturb the laminar solution directly onto a quasi-turbulent
solution. We will show, however, that the threshold disturbances perturb the laminar solution to a
point on the stable manifold of a quasi-turbulent solution (point P in Figure 1). A slightly larger

in this paper. The solid oval stands for the laminar solution, and the empty oval stands for a
quasi-turbulent steady or traveling wave solution.

disturbance brings the ﬂow close to the quasi-turbulent solution, after which the ﬂow follows the
unstable manifold of the quasi-turbulent solution and becomes fully turbulent.

The dynamical picture presented in Figure 1 is related directly and indirectly to much earlier
research. Basic results from hydrodynamic stability show that some eigenmodes that correspond
to the least stable eigenvalue of the linearization around the laminar solution do not depend upon
the spanwise or z direction. This may lead one to expect that disturbances that trigger transition
to turbulence are 2-dimensional. That expectation is not correct, however. As shown by Orszag
and Kells [10], spanwise variation is an essential feature of disturbances that trigger transition to
turbulence. Accordingly, all the disturbances considered in this paper are 3-dimensional.

Kreiss et al. [6] and Lundbladh et al. [7] investigated disturbances that are non-normal pseu-
domodes of the linearization of the laminar solution. Since the laminar solution is linearly stable,
a slight perturbation along an eigenmode will simply decay back to the laminar solution at a pre-
dictable rate. The pseudomodes are chosen to maximize transient growth of the solution of the
linearized equation, which is a consequence of the non-normality of the linearization. Such distur-
bances lead to transition with quite small amplitudes and will be considered again in this paper. It
must be noted, however, that any consideration based on the linearization alone can only be valid in
a small region around the laminar solution. The dynamics of transition to turbulence, as sketched
in Figure 1, involves an approach towards a quasi-turbulent solution that lies at an O(1) distance
from the laminar solution. It is therefore necessary to work with the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes
equation to explicate the dynamics of transition to turbulence.

Figure 2 shows the variation of the disturbance energy with time for a disturbance that leads
to transition. We observe that the disturbance energy increases smoothly initially and is then
followed by a spike. The spike is in turn followed by turbulence. The spike corresponds to a
secondary instability, as ﬁrst noted by Orszag and Patera [11].
In fact, the so-called secondary
instability is just the linear instability of a quasi-turbulent solution as will become clear.

Partly motivated by the secondary instability, there was a search for nonlinear steady solutions
related to transition as reviewed in [3]. An early success in this eﬀort was due to Nagata [9] who
computed steady solutions of plane Couette ﬂow in the interval 500 ≤ Re ≤ 1200. The lower branch
solution of Nagata is quasi-turbulent as evident from Figure 6 of his paper. Waleﬀe [14, 15, 16]
introduced a more ﬂexible method for computing such solutions and argued that such solutions

could be related to transition to turbulence. Waleﬀe and Wang [17] considered the scaling of a
family of quasi-turbulent solutions in the limit Re → ∞ and suggested that threshold amplitudes
scale as 1/Re.

The computations in [6, 7] imply that threshold amplitudes scale as Reα for α < −1. The
value of α appears to depend upon the type of perturbation. Our focus is not on determining the
scaling of the threshold amplitudes. Nevertheless, we will discuss numerical diﬃculties that beset
determination of threshold amplitudes.

Section 2 reviews some basic aspects of plane Couette ﬂow. The numerical method used to
ﬂesh out the dynamical picture of Figure 1 is given in Section 3. This numerical method has two
parts to it. The ﬁrst part is the determination of an approximate value for the threshold amplitude
as in earlier work [6, 7]. The second part is the computation of the quasi-turbulent solution that
controls the transition to turbulence as sketched in Figure 1. The numerical method for this part
follows [13], and that method makes it possible to use spatial discretizations with a large number
of degrees of freedom.

In Section 4, we consider three diﬀerent types of disturbances. The quasi-turbulent solutions
(empty oval of Figure 1) that correspond to the ﬁrst two types are steady solutions. For a given Re,
the solutions that correspond to these two types are identical modulo certain symmetries of plane
Couette ﬂow. The quasi-turbulent solutions that correspond to the third type of disturbance are
traveling waves with nonzero waves speeds. Ours appears to be the ﬁrst computation of traveling
waves with nonzero wave speeds within plane Couette ﬂow.

In Section 5, we consider some qualitative aspects of the solutions reported in Section 4. Section
5 explains why these solutions are called quasi-turbulent. They may just as well be called quasi-
laminar. A surprising ﬁnding is that these these solutions are less unstable for larger Re. The top
eigenvalue of these solutions is real and positive. For one family of solutions, the top eigenvalue
appears to decrease at the rate Reα for α ≈ −0.46.

In the concluding Section 6, we give additional context for this paper from two points of view.
The ﬁrst point of view is mainly computational and has to do with reduced dimension methods.
In this paper, we have taken care to use adequate spatial resolution to ensure that the computed

4

solutions are true solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation. We recognize, however, that resolving all
scales may prove computationally infeasible in some practical situations. We argue that transition
to turbulence computations can be useful in gaging the possibilities and limitations of methods that
do not resolve all scales. Secondly, we brieﬂy discuss the connection of transition computations
with transition experiments.

2 Some aspects of plane Couette ﬂow

The Navier-Stokes equation ∂u/∂t + (u.∇)u = −(1/ρ)∇p + (1/Re)△u describes the motion of
incompressible ﬂuids. The velocity ﬁeld u satisﬁes the incompressible constraint ∇.u = 0. For
plane Couette ﬂow the boundary conditions are u = (±1, 0, 0) at the walls, which are at y = ±1.
To render the computational domain ﬁnite, we impose periodic boundary conditions in the x and
z directions, with periods 2πΛx and 2πΛz, respectively. To enable comparison with [7], we use
Λx = 1.0 and Λz = 0.5 throughout this paper.

Certain basic quantities are useful for forming a general idea of the nature of a velocity ﬁeld of
plane Couette ﬂow. The ﬁrst of these is the rate of energy dissipation per unit volume for plane
Couette ﬂow, which is given by

For the laminar solution (u, v, w) = (y, 0, 0), both D and I are normalized to evaluate to 1. Ex-
pressions such as (2.1) and (2.2) are derived using formal manipulations. The derivations would be
mathematically valid if the velocity ﬁeld u were assumed to be suﬃciently smooth. Although such
smoothness properties of solutions of the Navier-Stokes are yet to be proved, numerical solutions
possess the requisite smoothness. Even solutions in the turbulent regime appear to be real analytic
in the time and space variables, which is why spectral methods have been so successful in turbulence
computations.

In the long run, on physical grounds, we expect the time averages of D and I to be equal
because the energy dissipated through viscosity must be input at the walls. For steady solutions
and traveling waves, the values of D and I must be equal.

Another useful quantity is the disturbance energy. The disturbance energy of (u, v, w) is ob-
tained by integrating (u− y)2 + v2 + w2 over the computational box. This quantity has already been
used in Figure 2. The disturbance energy is a measure of the distance from the laminar solution.
Two discrete symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equation for plane Couette ﬂow will enter the

discussion later. The shift-reﬂection transformation of the velocity ﬁeld is given by

Plane Couette ﬂow is unchanged under both these transformations. Thus if a single velocity ﬁeld
along a trajectory of plane Couette ﬂow satisﬁes either symmetry, all points along the trajectory
must have the same symmetries. However, velocity ﬁelds that lie on the stable and unstable
manifolds of symmetric periodic or relative periodic solutions need not be symmetric.

3 Numerical method

The Navier-Stokes equation in the standard form given in Section 2 cannot be viewed as a dynamical
system because the velocity ﬁeld u must satisfy the incompressibility condition and because there is
no equation for evolving the pressure p. It can be recast as a dynamical system, however, by using
the y components of u and ∇ × u, which is the vorticity ﬁeld. If the resulting system is discretized
in space using M + 1 Chebyshev points in the y direction, and 2L and 2N Fourier points in the x
and z directions, respectively, the number of degrees of freedom of the spatially discretized system
is given by

2(M − 1) + (2M − 4)((2N − 1)(2L − 1) − 1)

(3.1)

as shown in [13].

Given a form of the disturbance P , the threshold for transition is obtained by integrating the
disturbed velocity (y, 0, 0) + ǫP in time for diﬀerent ǫ [6]. If ǫ is greater than the threshold value,
the ﬂow will spike and become turbulent as evident from Figures 2 and 3. If ǫ is below the threshold
value, the ﬂow will relaminarize. As indicated by Figures 2 and 3, we may graph either disturbance
energy or D to examine a value of ǫ. We may also graph I deﬁned by (2.2) against time.

The accurate determination of thresholds is beset by numerical diﬃculties. To begin with,
suppose that we are able to integrate the Navier-Stokes equation for plane Couette ﬂow exactly.
Then as implied by the dynamical picture in Figure 1, a disturbance of the laminar solution that
is on the threshold will fall into a quasi-turbulent solution, and it will take inﬁnite time to do
so. However, computations for determining the threshold, such as that shown in Figure 2, can
only be over a ﬁnite interval of time. Thus the ﬁniteness of the time of integration is a source
of error in determining thresholds. Two other sources of error are spatial discretization and time
discretization.

An accurate determination of the threshold will need to estimate and balance these three sources
of error carefully. In our computations, we determine the thresholds with only about 2 digits of
accuracy. That modest level of accuracy is suﬃcient for our purposes.
In Tables 1 and 3, the
thresholds are reported using disturbance energy per unit volume.

Once the threshold has been determined, we need to compute a steady solution or a traveling
wave to complete the dynamical picture of Figure 1. The initial guess for that quasi-turbulent solu-
tion is produced by perturbing the laminar solution by adding the numerically determined threshold
disturbance and integrating the perturbed point over the time interval used for determining the
threshold (this time interval is 500 in Figure 2 and 300 in Figure 3).

That initial guess is fed into the method described in [13] to ﬁnd a quasi-turbulent solution with
good numerical accuracy. That method ﬁnds solutions by solving Newton’s equations, as perhaps
every conceivable method must in some way or the other, but has some novel features that we
point out here. Suppose that the spatially discretized equation for plane Couette ﬂow is written as
˙x = f (x), where the dimension of x is given by (3.1). To ﬁnd a steady solution, for instance, it is
natural to solve f (x) = 0 after supplementing that equation by some conditions that correspond
to the symmetries (2.3) and (2.4). However that is not the way we proceed. We solve for a ﬁxed
point of the time t map x(t; x0), for a ﬁxed value of t, after accounting for the symmetries. The
Newton equations are solved using GMRES. The method does not always compute the full Newton
step, however. Instead, the method ﬁnds the ideal trust region step within a Krylov subspace as
described in [13].

This method can easily handle more than 105 degrees of freedom, and thus makes it possible to
carry out calculations with good spatial resolution. The reason for setting up the Newton equations
in the peculiar way described in the previous paragraph has to do with the convergence properties
of GMRES. The matrix that arises in solving the Newton equations approximately has the form
I − ∂x(t; x0)/∂x0, where I is the identity. Because of viscous damping of high wavenumbers,
many of the eigenvalues of that matrix will be close to 1, thus facilitating convergence of GMRES.
We may expect the convergence to deteriorate as Re increases, because viscous damping of high
wavenumbers is no longer so pronounced, and that is indeed the case. Nevertheless, we were able
to go up to Re = 4000, and we believe that even higher values of Re can be reached.

4 Disturbances of the laminar solution and transition to turbu-

lence

In this section, we consider three types of disturbances and determine the threshold amplitudes
for various values of Re. To complete the dynamical picture of Figure 1, we determine for each
disturbance the steady solution or traveling wave that corresponds to the empty oval of that ﬁgure
using the numerical method of the previous section.

Table 1: Data for disturbances of the form (4.1) with unsymmetric noise and for steady solutions
that correspond to the empty oval in Figure 1. The steady solutions are labeled B1 through B4.
D and I, which are deﬁned by (2.1) and (2.2), correspond to those steady solutions. The next
two columns give the eigenvalue with the maximum real part and the frictional Reynolds number
for those solutions. T is the time interval used to determine the threshold disturbance and the
threshold is reported using disturbance energy per unit volume.

We follow [6] and consider the disturbance,

(u, v, w) = ǫ(0, ψz, −ψy),

(4.1)

where ψ = (1 − y2)2 sin(z/Λz). This disturbance is unchanged by both S1, which was deﬁned by
(2.3), and by S2, which was deﬁned by (2.4). A disturbance of the laminar solution u = (y, 0, 0) of
the form (4.1) never leads to transition to turbulence. It is necessary to add some more terms to
the disturbance to make the velocity ﬁeld depend upon the x direction.

To introduce dependence on x, we add modes of the Stokes problem. One can get an eigen-
value problem for ˆv(y), where v = ˆv(y) exp(ιlx/Λx + ιnz/Λz) exp(σt), or for ˆη(y), where η =
ˆη(y) exp(ιlx/Λx + ιnz/Λz) exp(σt). Here η is the wall-normal component of the vorticity ﬁeld. For
a v mode, η = 0, and vice versa. For a given mode, the velocity ﬁeld is recovered using the di-
vergence free condition. The velocity ﬁelds of modes with diﬀerent (l, n) are obviously orthogonal.
A calculation shows that the velocity ﬁelds for the v and η modes with the same (l, n) are also
orthogonal. For a given (l, n), we pick the v and η modes with the least stable σ.

To the disturbance (4.1), we added both v and η modes for (l, n) with −3 ≤ l ≤ 3 and
−7 ≤ n ≤ 7. Together the added modes can be called noise. The energy of the noise was equal to
1% of the energy of (4.1). This energy was equally distributed over the various orthogonal modes.
Following [6], we chose random phases for the modes. The threshold can depend upon the choice of
phase. Therefore, for accurate determination of thresholds it is better to use non-random phases.
After adding modes of this form to (4.1), the resulting disturbance in unchanged by neither S1
nor S2. Therefore the disturbance is unsymmetric. Table 1 reports data from computations carried
out using such an unsymmetric disturbance. The thresholds in that table give the energy of (4.1)
and do not include the energy within the noise terms. The quasi-turbulent solutions B1 through
B4 correspond to the empty oval in Figure 1. Each of these solutions appears to have a single
unstable eigenvalue. We determined the most unstable eigenvalues using simultaneous iteration
and the time t map of the Navier-Stokes equation, as in Section 3, with t = 8. All the solutions
seem to have just one unstable eigenvalue. That eigenvalue is real. Surprisingly, it decreases with
Re at the rate Reα, where α ≈ −0.46. Thus the quasi-turbulent solutions become less and less
unstable with increasing Re.

All our computations used (2L, M + 1, 2N ) = (24, 65, 32). By (3.1), the number of degrees of
freedom in the computation for ﬁnding the quasi-turbulent solutions is 88414. As shown by Figure

Table 1 as follows: Cn(x + sx, y, z + sz) = Bn.

4, this much resolution is entirely adequate. The solutions B1 through B4 are computed with at
least 5 digits of accuracy.

It has been suggested that one purpose of adding the noise to (4.1) is to break symmetries and
that a symmetric disturbance would lead to drastically increased thresholds [6]. To investigate
that matter, we symmetrized the disturbances used to generate Table 1. More speciﬁcally, if u is a
disturbed velocity ﬁeld, we replaced it by (u + S1u + S2u + S1S2u) which is unchanged by both S1
and S2. A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows that the thresholds are in fact not elevated. Thus
we conclude that the purpose of adding the noise is not to break the symmetry but to introduce
dependence on the x direction. The quasi-turbulent solutions that correspond to such symmetric
disturbances are labeled C1 through C4 in Table 2.

The solutions C1 though C4 are just translations of the solutions B1 through B4 as indicated
in Table 2. If the thresholds were determined exactly, the disturbances of Tables 1 and 2 would
come arbitrarily close to the corresponding solution in the inﬁnite time limit. Each threshold in
those tables was determined inexactly using a ﬁnite time interval, and we veriﬁed that the disturbed
states evolve and come within 2% of the corresponding quasi-turbulent solution. Thus there can be
little doubt about the role of these quasi-turbulent solutions in the transition to turbulence. The
C family of solutions appears to be the same as the lower branch family of [9, 16, 17].

Given that the solutions C1 through C4 are just translations of the solutions B1 through B4, it

is tempting to think that all threshold disturbances, say at Re = 4000, might approach a translate
of a single solution such as C4. That is not correct, however, as we will now show.

The disturbances for Table 3 were obtained by superposing Orr-Sommerfeld modes as in [10].
An Orr-Sommerfeld mode is of the form (u, v, w) = (ˆu(y), ˆv(y), ˆw(y)) exp(ιlx/Λx +ιnz/Λz) exp(σt).
We use Orr-Sommerfeld modes with (l, n) = ±(1, 0) and (l, n) = ±(1, 1). The disturbance energy
was equally distributed across the modes. For given (l, n), we chose the least stable mode and
symmetrized it as in Equation (3.2) of [10]. Note that the disturbance depends on both the x and
z directions. The solutions obtained by following the numerical method of Section 3 were traveling
waves in this case. The wave speeds for both D1 and D2 in Table 3 are nonzero in the x direction.
These traveling waves are unsymmetric and they do not become symmetric even after translations
in the x and z directions.

As stated earlier, the laminar solution of plane Couette ﬂow is linearly stable. A discussion of
its basin of attraction can be found in [4]. The computations of this section show that there are
points on the basin boundary that belong to stable manifolds of distinct solutions. Thus the basin
boundary cannot be identiﬁed with the stable manifold of a single quasi-turbulent solution.

5 Quasi-turbulent solutions of plane Couette ﬂow

A notable feature of the solutions of Tables 1, 2 and 3 is that the solutions are streaky. This feature
is illustrated in Figure 5. The contour lines for the streamwise velocity are approximately parallel
to the x axis, but the streamwise velocity varies in a pronounced way in the z direction. We observe
that D1 is less streaky than C1. The contour lines become much straighter when we go from C1 to
C4. This increase in streakiness with Re is in accord with the asymptotic theory sketched in [17].
To understand why these solutions are termed quasi-turbulent, we begin by describing the use

respectively. If the width of the channel is L, the frictional Reynolds number is given by Reτ =
Luf /ν = L/lf . The width of the channel in frictional units equals the frictional Reynolds number.
The use of frictional units is signaled by using + as a superscript.

The use of frictional units is necessary to state some remarkable properties of turbulent boundary
layers. If y+ measures the distance from the wall and <u>+ is the mean streamwise velocity in
frictional units, after making < u>+= 0 at y+ = 0 by shifting the mean velocities if necessary,
then <u>+≈ y+ in the viscous sublayer. The viscous sublayer is about 5 frictional units thick.
The buﬀer layer extends from 5 to about 30 units. It is followed by the logarithmic layer where
<u>+≈ A log y+ + B, for constants A and B. These relationships between <u>+ and y+ have
been conﬁrmed in numerous experiments and in some computations. The experiments are of a very
diverse nature as discussed in [8], and it is remarkable that such a simple relationship holds across
all those experiments.

There are other relationships that govern the dependence of quantities such as turbulence in-
tensities or turbulent energy production on the distance from the wall. These relationships also
characterize turbulent boundary layers. To show that the C and D solutions are quasi-turbulent,
we will use plots of turbulent energy production. Turbulent energy production equals

where u∗ = u− <u> and v∗ = v− <v> are the ﬂuctuating components of the streamwise and wall-
normal velocities and <u> is the mean streamwise velocity. Turbulent energy production is easy
to measure experimentally and shows a very sharp peak in the buﬀer region of turbulent boundary
layers [5]. This sharp peak has intrigued experimentalists for a long time.
In experiments, the
means are calculated by averaging pointwise measurements over long intervals of time. The means
involved in the deﬁnition of turbulent energy production will be computed by averaging in the x
and z directions.

Figure 6 shows plots of turbulent energy production against y+, the distance from the upper
wall in frictional units. In each plot, y+ varies from 0 to the channel width. The ﬁrst plot is for
a turbulent steady solution of plane Couette ﬂow at Re = 400. The data for the velocity ﬁeld
of that solution is from [16]. The second and third plots are for C1 and C4, respectively. The

of turbulent boundary layers. The second and third plots correspond to higher Re, yet the peak
occurs farther away from the wall in frictional units and there is no sharp fall-oﬀ. The plots for
D1 and D2 are not shown. Those plots are similar that to the ones for C1 and C4 in that they
do not match what we expect for turbulent boundary layers. A notable diﬀerence is that the plots
for D1 and D2 are not symmetric about the center of the channel. We call the C and D solutions
quasi-turbulent because they exhibit some aspects of near-wall turbulence such as the formation of
streaks, but do not exhibit many other aspects.

6 Conclusion

We veriﬁed the dynamical picture for transition to turbulence given in Figure 1 for certain distur-
bances. We do not claim that that picture will hold for all disturbances. A more exhaustive study
of diﬀerent types of disturbances of the laminar solution would be desirable.

We found that the B or C solutions become less unstable as Re increases. This was an unex-

pected ﬁnding. Even a good heuristic explanation of this trend would be interesting.

We believe that transition to turbulence computations would be good targets for reduced di-
mension methods. Reduced dimension methods are diverse in nature. Although this is not the
place to review them, we believe the intricate dynamics of transition of turbulence featuring steady
solutions, traveling waves, thresholds and various types of disturbances makes it non-trivial to
reduce dimension. A valid way to reduce dimension must capture the dynamics correctly and
not introduce spurious artifacts. It has been known since the work of Orszag and Kells [10] that
under-resolved spatial discretizations lead to spurious transitions.

Connecting transition computations to experiments is impeded by two problems. Firstly, the
experiments are performed in much larger domains to eliminate boundary eﬀects. The numerical
methods reviewed and discussed in Section 2 ought to be able to handle at least 10 million degrees
of freedom with a good parallel implementation. Therefore it seems that computations can be
performed in much larger domains (i.e., domains with larger Λx and Λz) and that this problem can
be overcome. Secondly, it is very diﬃcult to imagine a way to reproduce the sort of disturbances
that have been considered in the computational literature in experiments. The disturbances used

12

in experiments are of a diﬀerent sort. For instance, one type of disturbance is to inject ﬂuid from
the walls. The best way to reconcile this disparity between computation and experiment might be
to carry out computations using good models of laboratory disturbances.

Abstract

Localized patterns and nonlinear oscillation formation on the bounded free
surface of an ideal incompressible liquid are analytically investigated . Cnoidal
modes, solitons and compactons, as traveling non-axially symmetric shapes are
discused. A ﬁnite-diﬀerence diﬀerential generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation is
shown to describe the three-dimensional motion of the ﬂuid surface and the limit
of long and shallow channels one reobtains the well known KdV equation. A tenta-
tive expansion formula for the representation of the general solution of a nonlinear
equation, for given initial condition is introduced on a graphical-algebraic basis.
The model is useful in multilayer ﬂuid dynamics, cluster formation, and nuclear
physics since, up to an overall scale, these systems display liquid free surface
behavior.

1 Introduction

Liquid oscillations on bounded surfaces have been studied intensively, both theoretically

[1-3] and experimentally [4-6]. The small-amplitude oscillations of incompressible drops

maintained by surface tension are usually characterized by their fundamental linear

modes of motion in terms of spherical harmonics [1-3]. Nonlinear oscillations of a liquid

drop introduce new phenomena and more complicated patterns (higher resonances,

solitons, compactons, breakup and fragmentation, fractal structures, superdeformed

shapes) than can be described by a linear theory. Nonlinearities in the description

of an ideal drop demonstrating irrotational ﬂow arise from Bernoulli’s equation for

the pressure ﬁeld and from the kinematic surface boundary conditions [7]. Computer

simulations have been carried for non-linear axial oscillations and they are in very good

agreement with experiments [4-6].

The majority of experiments show a rich variety of complicated shapes, many re-

lated to the spinning, breaking, ﬁssion and fusion of liquid drops. There are experiments

[6] and numerical simulations [2] where special rotational patterns of circulation emerge:

a running wave originates on the surface of the drop and then propagates inward. Re-

cent results (superconductors [8], catalytic patterns [9], quasi-molecular spectra [10],

numerical tests on higher order non-linear equations [11] and analytical calculations

on the non-compact real axis [12-13]) show shape-stable traveling waves for nonlinear

systems with compact geometry. Recent studies showed that a similar one-dimensional

analysis for the process of cluster emission from heavy nuclei and quasi-molecular spec-

tra of nuclear molecules yields good agreement with experiment [10]. Such solutions are

stable and express to a good extent the formation and stability of patterns, clusters,

droplets, etc. However, even localised, they have nor compact support neither period-

icity (excepting some intermediate steps of the cnoidal solutions, [10,13]), creating thus

diﬃculties when analysing on compact surfaces.

In the present paper we comment on the cnoidal-towards-solitons solution inves-

tigated in [9,12], especially from the energy point of view. We introduce here a new

nonlinear 3-dimensional dynamical model of the surface, in compact geometry (pools,

droplets, bubbles, shells), inspired by [12], and we investigate the possibilities to obtain

2

compacton-like solutions for this model. We also study the scale symmetries of such

solutions.

The model in [9,12] consider the nolinear hydrodynamic equations of the surface of

a liquid drop and show their direct connection to KdV or MKdV systems. Traveling so-

lutions that are cnoidal waves are obtained [10,13] and they generate multiscale patterns

ranging from small harmonic oscillations (linearized model), to nonlinear oscillations,

up to solitary waves. These non-axis-symmetric localized shapes are described by a

KdV Hamiltonian system, too, which results as the second order approximation of the

general Hamiltonian, next corrextion from the linear harmonic shape oscillations. Such

rotons were observed experimentally when the shape oscillations of a droplet became

nonlinear [4,6,8,13].

2 Liquid drop cnoidal and soliton solutions from

Hamiltonian approach

The dynamics governing one-dimensional surface oscillations of a perfect (ρ =const.),

irrotational ﬂuid drop (or bubble, shell) can be described by the velocity ﬁeld Φ and a

corresponding Hamiltonian [1-3,7,10,13]. By expanding the Hamiltonian and dynamical

equations in terms of a small parameter, i.e. the amplitude of the perturbation η over

the radius of drop R0, the usual linear theory is recovered in the ﬁrst order. Higher

order non-linear terms introduce deviations and produce large surface oscillations like
cnoidal waves [7]. These oscillations, under conditions of a rigid core of radius R0 − h
and non-zero angular momentum, transform into solitary waves. In the following, by

using the calculation developed in [10], we present the Hamiltonian approach for the

liquid drops nonlinear oscillations. However, this approach is diﬀerent from the nuclear

liquid drop model point of view in [10], since we do not use here the nuclear interaction

(shell corrections) responsible for the formation of diﬀerent potential valleys.

The total hydrodynamic energy E consists of the sum of the kinetic T and po-

tential U energies of the liquid drop. The shape function is assumed to factorize,

r(θ, φ, t) = R0(1 + g(θ)η(φ, t)). All terms that depend on θ are absorbed in the coeﬃ-

cients of some integrals and the energy reduces to a functional of η only. The potential

3

energy is given by the surface energy US = σ(Aη − A0)|V0, where σ is the surface pres-
sure coeﬃcient, Aη is the area of the deformed drop, and A0 the area of the spherical
drop, of constant volume V0. The kinetic energy T = ρHΣ Φ∇Φ · d~S/2, [1-3,10,13], the
kinematic free surface boundary condition Φr = ∂tr + (∂θr)Φθ/r2 + (∂φr)Φφ/r2 sin θ,
and the boundary condition for the radial velocity on the inner surface ∂rΦ|r=R0−h = 0,
[7], result in the expression [2,3,10]

are given in [10,13]. Therefore, the energy of the non-linear liquid drop model can be

interpreted as the Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional KdV equation. The coeﬃcients

in eq.(2) depend on two stationary functions of θ (the depth h(θ) and the transversal

proﬁle g(θ)), hence, under the integration, they involve only a parametric dependence.

The KdV equation has the following cnoidal wave (Jacobi elliptic function) as

exact solution

η = α3 + (α2 − α3)sn2(cid:18)s C3(α3 − α2)

(φ − V t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
m(cid:19),
where α1, α2, α3 are constants of integration, m2 = (α3 − α2)/(α3 − α1). This solution
oscillates between α2 and α3, with a period T = 2K(m)q (α3−α2)C3
, where K(m) is the
period of a Jacobi elliptic function sn(x|m). The parameter V is the velocity of the

. In the limit α1 = α2 = 0 the solution eq.(3)

approaches

η = η0sech2(cid:20)s η0C3

12C4

(φ − V t)(cid:21),

(4)

which is the soliton solution of amplitude η0. Small oscillation occur when α3 → α2 and
m → 0, T → π/2. Consequently, the system has two limiting solutions, a periodic and
a localized traveling proﬁle, which deform one into the other, by the initial conditions

and the velocity parameter V . A ﬁgure showing the deformation from the l = 5 cnoidal

mode towards a soliton is shown in Figs. 2.

The cnoidal solution eq.(3) depends on the parameters αi subjected to the volume

conservation and the periodicity condition of the solution (for the ﬁnal soliton state

this condition should be taken as a quasi-periodicity realised by the rapidly decreasing

proﬁle. This a problem of the basic model, [10]). The periodicity restriction reads

K(cid:18)s α3 − α2

α3 − α1(cid:19) =

π
n

√α3 − α1, n = 1, 2, . . . , 2√α3 − α1.

(5)

Hence, a single free parameter remains, which can be taken either one out of the three

α’s, V or η0. Equatorial cross-sections of the drop are shown in Fig. 2b for the cnoidal

solution at several values of the parameter η0. All explicite calculations are presented

in detail in [10].

In Fig. 3 we present the total energy plotted versus the parameters α1, α2 for
constant volume. From the small oscillation limit (α2 ≃ 3 in the ﬁgure) towards the
solitary wave limit (α2 = 1 in the ﬁgure) the energy increases and has a valley for
α1 ≃ 0.1 and α2 ∈ (1.2, 1.75) (close to the l = 2 mode). In order to introduce more
realistic results, the total hydrodynamic energy is plotted versus α1, α2 for constant

volume, too but we marked those special solutions fulﬁlling the periodicity condition.

In Fig. 4 we present the total energy valley, from the small oscillations limit towards

the solitary wave limit. We notice that the energy constantly increases but around
α2 ∈ (1.2, 1.75) (close to the linear l = 2 mode) it has a valley providing some stability
for solitary solution (also called roton [13]).

3 The three-dimensional nonlinear model

In the following we introduce a sort of generalized KdV equation for ﬂuids. We consider

the three-dimensional irrotational ﬂow of an ideal incompressible ﬂuid layer in a semi-

ﬁnte rectangular channel subjected to uniform vertical gravitation (g in z direction)

and to surface pressure [12]. The depth of the layer, when the ﬂuid is at rest is z =

h. Boundary conditions at the ﬁnite spaced walls consist in annilation of the normal
velocity component, i.e. on the bottom of the layer (z = 0) and on the walls x = x0±L/2
of the channel of width L. The following results remain valid if the walls expand
arbitrary, e.g. L → ∞, and the ﬂow is free. We choose for the potential of the
velocities the form

Φ = Xk≥0

(6)

where αk(t) are arbitrary functions of time and L is a free parameter. Eq.(7) fulﬁls
△Φ = 0 and the above boundary conditions at the walls. However there is another
boundary condition at the free surface of the ﬂuid [7]

(Φz − ηt − ηxΦx)z=h+η = 0,

where η(x, t) describes the shape of the free surface. By introducing the function

f (x, t) =

the velocity ﬁeld on the free surface can be written

Φx|z=h+η = − cosh(z∂x)f,
−Φz|z=h+η = − sinh(z∂x)f.

(7)

(8)

(9)

Eqs (10) do not depend on L and the case L → ∞ of unbounded channels and free
travelling proﬁles remains equaly valid. Since the unique force ﬁeld in the problem

is potential, the dynamics is described by the Bernoulli equation, which, at the free

surface, reads

Φxt + ΦxΦxx + ΦzΦxz + gηx +

and σ is the surface pressure coeﬃcient. The pressure in eq.(12) approaches −σηxx, for
small enough relative amplitude of the deformation η/h. In order to solve the system

of the two partial diﬀerential equations (8,11) with respect to the unknown functions

f (x, t) and η(x, t), we consider the approximation of small perturbations of the surface
compared to the depth, a = max|η(k)(x, t)| << h, where k = 0, ..., 3 are orders of
diﬀerentiation. Inspired by [12] and using a sort of perturbation technique in a/h, we

obtain from eqs.(6-11) the generalised KdV equation

2 (cid:18)˜ηx ˜ηxx + ˜η ˜ηxxx(cid:19) = 0,

(13)

where ǫ = a

h . The ﬁrst four terms in eq.(20) correspond to the zero order approximation
terms in f , obtained from the boundary condition at the free surface, i.e. the traditional

way of obtaining the KdV equation in shallow channels.

In order to ﬁnd an exact solution for eq.(12) we can write it in the form:

AhuX(X) +

u(X + h) − u(X − h)

2i

+ uX(X)

u(X + h) + u(X − h)

2

+ u(X)

uX(X + h) + uX(X − h)

2

= 0,

(14)

where X = x + Ac0t and A is an arbitrary real constant. We want to stress here that

eq.(14) is a ﬁnite-diﬀerence diﬀerential equation, which is rather the exception than

the rule ﬁr such systems. Hence, it may contain among its symmetries, the scaling

symmetry. Actualy, the ﬁrst derivative of u(X) is shown to be alinear combination of

translated versions of the original function. In this way, the theory of such equations

7

can be related with the wavelet, or other self-similarity systems, theory, [13]. In the

following we study the solutions with a rapid decreasing at inﬁnity and make a change
of variable: v = eBX for x ∈ (−∞, 0) and v = e−BX for x ∈ (0,∞), with B an arbitrary
constant. Writing u(X) = −hA + f (v), and choosing for the solution the form of a
power series in v:

f (v) =

anvn,

∞

Xn=0

we obtain a nonlinear recurrsion relation for the coeﬃcients an:

n(cid:18)cosh (Bh(k − n)) + cosh(Bh(k − 1))(cid:19)anak−n.

(15)

(16)

With the coeﬃcients given in eq.(16) the general solution η can be written analyticaly.

In order to verify the consistency of this solution we study a limiting case of the relation,

by replacing sin and cosh expressions with their lowest nonvanishing terms in their power

expansions Thus, eq.(16) reduces to

(19)

which is just the single-soliton solution of the KdV equation and it was indeed obtained

by assuming h small in the recurrence relation (16). Hence, we have shown that the KdV

equation describing the shallow liquids can be generalised for any depths and lengths.

This result may be the starting point to search for more interesting symmetries.

It

would be interesting to interpret the generalized-KdV eq.(12) as the Casimir element

of a certain algebra.

4 Compacton and self-similar solutions

Eq.(12) has a special character, namely contains both inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite diﬀerence

operators. This particularity relates it to another ﬁeld of nonlinear systems, that is

scaling functions and wavelet basis, functions or distributions with compact support and

self-similarity properties. In the following we investigate a particular case of eq.(12),
that is when h ≪ η, h ≪ δ, where δ is the half-width of the solution, if this has bounded
or compact support. In this approximations, from eq.(12) we keep only the terms

ηηx −

2

ηxηxx +

h

ηηx −

2

ηηxxx + O3 ≃ 0.

(20)

This equation is related to another intergable system, namely the K(2,2) equation,

investigated in [11]

ηt + (η2)x + (η2)xxx = 0.

(21)

The main property of the K(2,2) equation is the equal occurence of non-linearity, dis-

persion and the existence of a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian system associated with it.

The special solutions of this equation are the compactons

ηc =

4η0
3

cos2(cid:18)x − η0t

4

(cid:19),

|x − η0t| ≥ 2π,

(22)

and ηc = 0 otherwise. This special solutions have compact support and special proper-

ties concerning the scattering between diﬀerent such solutions. As the authors comment

in [11], the robustness of these solutions makes it clear that a new mechanism is un-

derlying this system. In this respect, we would like to add that, taking into account

eq.(12), this new mechanism might be related to selfsimilarity and multiscale properties

of nonlinear systems.

5 Conclusions

In the present paper we introduced a non-linear hydrodynamic model describing new

modes of motion of the free surface of a liquid. The total energy of this nonlinear liquid

9

drop model, subject to non-linear boundary conditions at the free surface and the inner

surface of the ﬂuid layer, gives the Hamiltonian of the Korteweg de Vries equation. We

have studied the stability of the cnoidal wave and solitary wave solutions, from the

point of view of minima of this Hamiltonian.

The non-linear terms yield rotating steady-state solutions that are cnoidal waves

on the surface of the drop, covering continuously the range from small harmonic oscilla-

tions, to anharmonic oscillations, and up to solitary waves. The initial one-dimensional

model [10] was extend to a three-dimensional model. A kind of new generalized KdV

equation, together with some of its analytical solutions have been presented. We also

found a connection between the obtained generalized KdV equation, and another one

(i.e. K(2,2)), in a certain approximation. In this case, compacton solutions have been

found and new symmetries (e.g. self-similarity) were put into evidence.

The analytic solutions of the non-linear model presented in this paper, make pos-

sible the study of clusterization as well as to explain or predict the existence of new

strongly deformed shapes, or new patterns having compact support or ﬁnite wavelength.

The model applies not only in ﬂuid and rheology theories, but may provide insight into

similar processes occurring in other ﬁelds and at other scales, such as the behavior

of superdeformed nuclei, supernova, preformation of cluster in hydrodynamic models

(metallic, molecular, nuclear), the ﬁssion of liquid drops (nuclear physics), inertial fu-

sion, etc.

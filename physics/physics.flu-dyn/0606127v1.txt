Abstract

To date it has not been possible to prove whether or not the three-dimensional

incompressible Euler equations develop singular behaviour in ﬁnite time. Some pos-

sible singular scenarios, as for instance shock-waves, are very important from a

physical point of view, since they imply the connection among the macroscopic

and the microscopic scale. Therefore, the appearence of this type of singularity

or a similar one might be interpreted as a possible explanation of the transition

to turbulence. In order to clarify the question, some one-dimensional models for

ideal incompressible hydrodynamics have been introduced and analyzed, and it was

proven that shock-waves appear in ﬁnite time within this type of ﬂow. In this work

we question the validity of these models and analyze the physical meaning that the

occurrence of a singularity in an incompressible ﬂow, if it happens, may have.

1 Introduction

It is not yet known whether or not the three-dimensional incompressible Eu-

ler equations develop singular behaviour in ﬁnite time. Far from being a pure

mathematical problem, it has deep connections with some fundamental ques-

tions in physics. Actually, the relation between the appearance of ﬁnite time

singularities and the onset of turbulence has been conjectured, because singu-

larity formation may be a mechanism of energy transfer from large to small

scales (or may not, see [1,2]). There are several types of blow-ups that can oc-

curr in a ﬂuid ﬂow, such as, for instance, an inﬁnite increment of the velocity

in some spatial point. This kind of blow-up is not useful for an understanding

of turbulence, since it might be interpreted as a break down of the nonrela-

tivistic description. This is, if the velocity becomes too large, it is necessary

to modify the equations to include relativistic eﬀects [3]. On the other hand,

a shock-wave is a singularity of the ﬁrst spatial derivative of the velocity.

Shock-waves are events in the ﬂow where the continuum description breaks

down and a kinetic description, such as the Boltzmann equation, becomes

necessary [4,5]. This suggests that shock-waves are a link between the micro-

scopic and the macroscopic scale. In conclusion, we may argue that the onset

of turbulence might be related with such situations in which the ﬂow develops

a shock-wave (or a similar phenomenon, see below), but in which the velocity

remains bounded. All along this work we will be concerned (unless explicitely

indicated) with ﬂows carrying a ﬁnite total kinetic energy, since we consider

this characteristic as necessary to keep the physical meaning of the ﬂow.

First of all, let us clarify a question of language. Usually, it is understood that

a shock-wave is a discontinuity of the velocity of the ﬂow. Of course, the ﬁrst

spatial derivative of the ﬂow will present a Dirac delta singularity located at

2

the shock, but it is possible to ﬁnd a singularity of the ﬁrst spatial derivative

of a continuous velocity ﬁeld, just by letting the slope of the tangent go to

inﬁnity. We can name this type of events (continuous velocity and divergence

of its ﬁrst spatial derivative) as quasi-shock-waves, due to its high similarity

to traditional shock-waves. Let us explain why. Consider a continuous one-

dimensional velocity ﬁeld v(x), its ﬁrst spatial derivative at x0 is given by

v′(x0) = limh→0(v(x0 + h)

v(x0))/h. This quantity will be divergent if there

−

is a high accumulation of diﬀerent values of v near x0. A high accumulation of

diﬀerent values of the velocity in the neighbourhood of one point reveals that

the continuum description of the ﬂuid is less accurate, and this descripcion

becomes ill deﬁned when a divergence is developed. This shows that shock-

waves and quasi-shock-waves are singular events of the very same kind, both

revealing the failure of the continuum description of the ﬂuid ﬂow and the need

of a kinetic description (and maybe the connection between the macroscopic

and the microscopic scales). An equivalent way to describe the phenomenon

is to see it as the collision of two ﬂuid particles, as we will see below.

2 First approach to singular behaviour

The three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations read:

∂tv + (v

)v =

· ∇

p,

−∇

(1a)

(1b)

where v is the velocity, a three-dimensional vector, and p is the pressure, a

scalar. Eq.(1a) is Newton’s law for the ﬂuid, the left hand side is the convective

derivative of the velocity and the right hand side is the force in terms of the

v = 0,

∇ ·

3

pressure. Eq.(1b) is the incompressibility condition for the ﬂuid. These equa-

tions can be obtained from the Boltzmann equation performing the Chapman-

Enskog expansion [6], but full mathematical proofs are available only before

the appearance of singularities [7,8]. The Boltzmann equation describes the

dynamics of a rareﬁed gas, taking into account two basic processes: the free

ﬂight of the particles and their collisions. In the hydrodynamic description, the

convective derivative simulates the free ﬂight of the particles and the gradient

of the pressure is the ﬁrst order correction to the interaction among them. The

second order correction yields the Navier-Stokes equations, that are obtained

by adding the term µ

2v to the right hand side of Eq.(1a), where µ > 0

∇

is the viscosity of the ﬂuid. The third order is still an open problem, how-

ever some insight has been gained into it by means of a regularization of the

Chapman-Enskog expansion [9,10]. These partial achivements suggest that at

small scales the viscosity loses eﬀectivity [10], what makes more interesting

to study the dynamics of an inviscid ﬂuid when we are close to the onset of

turbulence.

equation:

Due to the mathematical diﬃculties that a direct treatment of the Euler equa-

tions imply, many simpliﬁed models have been introduced in order to un-

derstand better Euler dynamics. One classical approximation is the Burgers

∂tv + v∂xv = 0,

(2)

where v is the one-dimensional velocity. It is interesting to note that Burgers

equation is a one-dimensional analogue of Euler equations where the pressure

has been supressed. This equation is known to develop shock-waves in ﬁnite

time as a consequence of the crossing of its characteristics [11]. This result

can be easily understood if one remembers the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi

4

equation for the free particle

∂tS =

1
2m

(∂xS)2,

(3)

recalling that the momentum is given by p = ∂xS we see that deriving once

with respect to the spatial variable Eq.(3), substituting p = mv, and reversing

the direction of time t

t (remember that classical mechanics is invariant

→ −

with respect to time reversing) we recover Burgers equation. Thus Burgers

equation can be thought as the evolution of the velocity of a cloud of free

particles. Since this gas is noninteracting, the characteristics of the Hamilton-

Jacobi equation, the Hamilton equations (the particle trajectories), will cross

when subject to an adequate initial condition, what physically means that the

ﬂuid particles collide in ﬁnite time. Obviously, this fact does not require an

inﬁnite kinetic energy or an unbounded velocity of the ﬂuid. This cannot be

directly translated to the Euler equations, since the pressure term acts as a

force against this type of collisions. However, if we introduce an interaction

between the particles in the form of a viscosity

∂tv + v∂xv = µ

2v,

∇

(4)

we get global existence of the solution. So it seems that in this case the shocks

are an artifact of the noninteracting character of the particles.

It is important to understand what we mean by ﬂuid particles and by collisions

among them. A ﬂuid particle is not a molecule composing the ﬂuid. It is a

coarse-graining concept that corresponds to a point in the hydrodynamical

(macroscopic) description of the ﬂuid. But it is actually composed of a high

number of molecules. Correspondingly, a collision among ﬂuid particles does

not implie the collapse of two molecules. It is only the superposition of two

coarse-graining entities reﬂecting the failure of the macroscopic approach. It

is then necessary to describe the ﬂuid microscopically in terms of the actual

5

molecules composing the ﬂow (this is the kinetic decription we refer to above).

It is known that the compressible Euler equation develop shock-waves as

well [12] (and that they are again regularized by the viscosity in one dimen-

sion). This shocks are, however, completely due to the compressible character

of the ﬂow, and cannot be extrapolated to incompressible ﬂows [12]. This sug-

gests that, if a singularity is present in an incompressible ﬂow, it would not be

of the shock type. The real problem is in contrast much more complex: when

small-scale structures appear through the nonlinear dynamical evolution, they

tend to display, at least locally, a much faster dependence on one particular

spatial dimension (a phenomenon known as depletion of nonlinearity) [13].

In the limit, a ﬂow collapsed into one spatial dimension displays a singular

behaviour of the quasi-shock-wave type: the ﬂuid particles collapse into a one-

dimensional structure revealing the failure of the continuum description. Also,

there is rigorous work showing that if a singularity is present, it is due to the

collapse of a small-scale structure [14]. This shows that if a divergence appears

in the three-dimensional Euler ﬂow, it might be a phenomenon related to a

shock-wave, although not necessarily a shock-wave itself.

To clarify the question at hand, let us consider one example of inﬁnite energy

exact solution that shows a strong tendence towards the shock-wave. Some

exact inﬁnite energy singular solutions might be found in [15], and among

them we choose the following one in cylindrical coordinates

v = v(vr(r, t), 0, vz(z, t)),

(5)

without a swirling component of the velocity, and where

vr(r, t) =

where T ∗ is the blow-up time. For a better understanding of the ﬂuid dynamics

This clearly indicates that all the particles of the ﬂuid collapse in the plane

z = 0 at the ﬁnite time t = T ∗. In spite of this strong tendence to form a

shock, this type of blow-up cannot be considered as a shock-wave since the

collapse occurs in a spatial point at an inﬁnite distance from the origin, and

at an inﬁnite velocity. What this solution indicates is that the nonrelativistic

description of the ﬂow has broken down.

3 Model equations for the vorticity dynamics

One of the most important results proved about the regularity of the solutions

of the Euler equations is the Beale-Kato-Majda theorem [16], that says that

the solution exists globally in time if and only if

The operator relating ω to

mutes with translation. In one spatial dimension there is only one such oper-

ator: the Hilbert transform.

In this spirit, Constantin et al. [17] proposed the following one-dimensional

model for the vorticity equation:

∂tω = H(ω)ω,

where H(ω) is the Hilbert transform of ω:

This equation was solved explicitly and it was shown that it blows up for some

ﬁnite time T0. However, it has been proven that the viscous analogue of this

equation

∂tω = H(ω)ω + ǫωxx,

(17)

blows up for some ﬁnite time Tǫ such that Tǫ < T0; this is, adding diﬀusion

makes the solution less regular. This is unsatisfactory in view of the result

by Constantin [18], which says that if the solution to the Euler equations is

smooth then the solutions to the slightly viscous Navier-Stokes equations are

also smooth. In order to prevent this behaviour, De Gregorio [19,20] introduced

an improved model keeping the convective derivative:

∂tω + u∂xω = ωH(ω) + µ∂xxω

(18)

with viscosity µ

0. This equation does not develop singular behaviour, and

≥

De Gregorio concluded that one-dimensional models for hydrodynamics are

not able to faithfully represent three-dimensional incompressible ﬂow.

Baker, Li, and Morlet studied a very similar one-dimensional model simulating

vortex sheet dynamics [21]:

∂tθ

H(θ)∂xθ = µθxx,

−

(19)

which has been reinterpreted as a model for the Euler equations by C´ordoba,

C´ordoba, and Fontelos [22] after switching µ = 0. In this model θ is a scalar

carried by the ﬂow, and the vorticity and the velocity are deﬁned, respectively,

by ω = θx and v =

H(θ). In reference [22] it is proven that this system blows

−

up for some ﬁnite time in some spatial point, provided the initial condition

is even, positive and compactly supported; then limt→T ∗

θx||L∞ =

∞

for

some T ∗ <

. As proven there, the solution is even whenever the initial

∞

condition is so, implying that its Hilbert transform, say the velocity, is odd,

and thus null at the origin. Also, the transport character of this equation

9

implies that

||L∞(0). Numerical evidence has indicated that the
blow-up appears in the origin [22,23], where a cusp of θ is formed. This type

||L∞(t) =

||

||

θ

of singularity corresponds to a (quasi-)shock, but we still need to know if the

velocity is bounded at the origin to assure that a genuine (quasi-)shock-wave is

formed. It is an important fact that the positivity of θ implies that v =

H(θ)

−

is a decreasing function, and since it is antisymmetric, this ﬂow simulates the

collision of two ﬂuid jets coming from inﬁnite with opposite directions. The

collision point is the origin, and the (quasi-)shock is generated when two ﬂuid

particles collide there.

We can establish the boundedness of the velocity using the properties of the

space of functions of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) (for the basic properties

of this space see, for instance, [24]):

In conclusion, we have shown that while the velocity remains bounded at

the origin, its ﬁrst derivative goes to inﬁnity in ﬁnite time, or what is the

same, the ﬂuid develops either a shock-wave or quasi-shock-wave. Finally, we

can show that these singular solutions have ﬁnite kinetic energy. We know

that

(27)

for a ﬁnite positive constant ˜C, and thus we see that the kinetic energy remains

bounded for all times.

To ﬁnish our analysis of this model let us point out one very interesting feature

of it. The particle trajectories are deﬁned, in this case, by

what implies, for a particle starting at the origin, that

for all times, due to the antisymmetric character of H(θ). So one particle

initially located at the origin will stay there for all times. Since this particle

is stopped, not only the velocity but also the acceleration will vanish for all

times, implying

This is, the velocity obeys Burgers equation locally at the origin. This fact is

very important, since it shows that the pressure vanishes at the origin, and the

shock is due to an artiﬁcial noninteracting character of the particles. These

considerations push us to conjecture that the shock-wave developed in this

type of ﬂow is exactly the same as that formed in the Burgers equation.

4 The hypoviscous Burgers equation

While Eq.(19) with µ = 0 develops (quasi-)shock-waves in ﬁnite time, it has

been proven that adding a hypoviscosity to this equation results in global

existence in time of the solution [22]. The corresponding hypoviscous equation

reads [22]

∂tθ

H(θ)∂xθ = µΛαθ,

−

where µ > 0 is the viscosity, 1 < α < 2, and Λα is a fractional derivative of

the Riesz type that is deﬁned from its Fourier transform

(31)

(32)

(Λαθ)ˆ=

k

α ˆθ.

−|

|

To conﬁrm the analogue between this model and the Burgers equation we

will analyze the hypoviscous version of the second one, and we will prove

global existence in time of the solutions. The eﬀect of hypoviscosity on Burgers

dynamics has been already studied in Ref. [27]; however, in this reference it is

analyzed the eﬀect of the hypoviscous dissipativity on the Burgers Markovian

Random Coupling Model, and we will analyze its eﬀect directly on the Burgers

equation.

The hypoviscous Burgers equation is

∂tv =

vvx + µΛαv.

−

(33)

12

Obviously, the case α = 2 corresponds to the standard viscous Burgers equa-

tion. In this case we will prove the nonexistence of the shock-wave or quasi-

shock-wave for a situation similar to that of Eq.(19), this is, for two colliding

ﬂuid jets. We will suppose therefore that vx ≤

constants and its value may change from line to line.

5 News from two- and three-dimensional incompressible ﬂows

In order to understand the physical meaning of the possible blow-ups ap-

pearing in the Euler equations it is useful to take a look to two- and three-

dimensional incompressible ﬂow. This is very important to delucidate whether

or not the one-dimensional models have physical meaning.

The problem of the blow-up for an incompressible ﬂuid was studied in Ref. [28]).

They studied four diﬀerent equations: the Quasi-Geostrophic equation, the

ideal two-dimensional Magneto-Hydrodynamics equation, the two-dimensional

Euler equation, and the Boussinesq equation. They found that for all these

equations, two arcs moving with the ﬂuid cannot collapse in ﬁnite time into

one single arc, provided the velocity is bounded. This is a strong result against

the possible formation of (quasi-)shock-waves within this type of ﬂow. Even

16

in three-dimensional incompressible ideal ﬂow there is a similar result proven

in this same direction [29].

As we have seen, a (quasi-)shock-wave develops when two ﬂuid particles collide

in ﬁnite time. Two arcs moving with the ﬂuid are level sets of ﬂuid particles,

its mutual collapse would imply the formation of a (quasi-)shock-wave. The

nonexistence of this type of singularity for bounded velocities suggests that

the possible blow-up of the solution to the three-dimensional incompressible

Euler equations is related to the breakdown of the nonrelativistic description

of the ﬂuid, while it has no relation with the phenomenon of turbulence.

Furthermore, this fact indicates that the appearance of (quasi-)shock-waves

in one-dimensional models is more related to a mathematical artifact than to

a real physical phenomenon.

6 Conclusions

In this work we have shown that one-dimensional models for three-dimensional

incompressible hydrodynamics showing the appearance of singular behaviour

fail to reproduce some of the most important features of the ﬂow. In the best

cases, the appearance of a (quasi-)shock-wave is due to the strong compress-

ible character of the ﬂow; actually, we arrive at the absurd conclusion that

these models for incompressible hydrodynamics are more compressible than a

compressible ﬂow. This is inferred from the fact that the shock develops due to

the noninteracting character of the ﬂuid particles in its neighbourhood, what

produces collisions among them. This strongly suggests that one-dimensional

settings are too limiting to correctly represent incompressible hydrodynamics.

On the other hand, the results involving two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow

17

show that the appearance of singularities is related with a divergence of the

velocity, what would rule out the possibility of (quasi-)shock-wave formation

within the ﬂow. This would show that possible singularities have nothing to

say in the transition to turbulence in incompressible ﬂows. Furthermore, the

divergence of the velocity would indicate the breakdown of the nonrelativistic

description of the ﬂuid, but would say nothing about the small scale properties

of it. This indicates that a blow-up of the velocity would have relevance in the

study of some special ﬂuids, such as interstellar plasmas, which reach velocities

that may be comparable to that of the light. However, the daily observed

phenomenon of turbulence, which appears in common ﬂuids at velocities not

comparable with light speed, seems to be not related with the existence of

singular solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations.

An experimental study is reported of the near-critical reﬂection of internal gravity waves over
sloping topography in a stratiﬁed ﬂuid. An overturning instability close to the slope and triggering
the boundary-mixing process is observed and characterized. These observations are found in good
agreement with a recent nonlinear theory.

INTRODUCTION

The reﬂection of near-critical internal waves over slop-
ing topography plays a crucial role in determining ex-
changes between the coastal ocean and the adjacent deep
waters. Direct measurements of mixing in the ocean, us-
ing tracers [1], have vindicated decades of phenomeno-
logical and theoretical inferences.
In particular, these
measurements have shown that most of the vertical mix-
ing is not taking place inside the ocean, but close to the
boundaries and topographic features [2]. These results
have directed attention to the possible role of internal
wave reﬂection in the boundary-mixing process.

Internal waves have diﬀerent properties of reﬂection
from a rigid boundary than do sound or light waves [3].
Instead of following the familiar Snell’s law,
internal
waves reﬂect oﬀ a boundary such that the angle with
respect to gravity direction is preserved upon reﬂection
(Fig. 1). This peculiar reﬂection law leads to a concen-
tration of the reﬂected energy density into a narrow ray
tube upon reﬂection as displayed in Fig. 1. Theoretical
descriptions of this reﬂection process have been framed
largely in terms of linear and stationary wave dynam-
ics [3, 4]. However, when the slope angle, γ, is equal
to the incident wave angle, β, these restrictions lead to
an unrealistic prediction: The reﬂected rays lie along the
slope with an inﬁnite amplitude and a vanishing group
velocity. Theoretical results have recently healed this sin-
gularity by taking into account the role of transience and
nonlinearity [5].

Following preliminary oceanographic measurements [6,
7], Eriksen [8] has beautifully observed, near the bottom
of a steep ﬂank of a tall North Paciﬁc Ocean seamount, an
internal wave reﬂection process leading to a clear depar-
ture from a Garett-Munk model [9] for wave frequencies
at which ray and bottom slopes match. Several exper-
imental facilities [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have therefore
been dedicated to the understanding of the internal wave

reﬂection and associated instabilities.

However, results of a controlled laboratory experiment
close to the critical conditions are still lacking since pre-
vious ones with a moving paddle [10, 11, 13] at one end
of a very long tank, or by the vibration of the tank it-
self [14], does not generate a clear incident wave-beam as
needed for a careful study. In addition, a direct compar-
ison with the recent and complete nonlinear theory near
the critical reﬂection would be possible. Finally, the goal
is to improve the understanding of the possible mixing
mechanism near the sloping topography of ocean as very
recently initiated by MacPhee and Kunze [16] by exhibit-
ing the instabilities mechanism leading to mixing. The
paper is organized as follows. The experimental setup is
described and carefully explained in Sec. II. The main
experimental results are presented in Sec. III, and com-
parisons with the theory is also provided. Finally, Sec. IV
contains conclusions and perspectives.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup consists of a 38 cm long Plex-
iglas tank, 10 cm wide, ﬁlled up to 22 cm height with
a linearly salt-stratiﬁed water obtained by the “double
bucket” method [17]. The choice of salt, Sodium Nitrate
(NaNO3) snow, is motivated due to its highly solubility
in water leading to a salty water viscosity close to the
fresh one. Moreover, this salt allows to reach a strong
stratiﬁcation: The ﬂuid density ( 1 <
∼ ρ(z) ≤ 1.2 g/cm3)
measured at diﬀerent altitudes (22 ≥ z > 0 cm) by a
conductimetric probe leads to a linear vertical density
proﬁle of slope dρ/dz ≃ −0.0104 g/cm4. A rectangular
Plexiglas sheet, 3 mm thick and 9.6 cm wide (to allow
exchange of water) is introduced at one end of the tank
with an angle γ = 35◦ with respect to the horizontal
tank bottom (see Fig. 1) to create the reﬂective sloping
boundary.

Internal waves are generated by a sinusoidal excita-
tion provided by the vertical motion of a horizontal PVC
plunging cylinder (3.1 cm in diameter and 9.4 cm long).
The cylinder is located roughly midway between the base
tank and the free surface. This wavemaker is driven by an
electromagnetic vibration exciter powered by a low fre-
quency power supply. Optical measurements conﬁrm [18]
that the cylinder motion is sinusoidal without distortions
for vibrational frequencies 0.2 ≤ f ≤ 0.5 Hz and maximal
displacement amplitudes up to 8.5 mm (peak to peak).

The well-known and non-intuitive dispersion relation
of internal waves in an incompressible, inviscid and lin-
early stratiﬁed ﬂuid reads [19]

ω = ±N

= ±N sin β ,

(1)

k⊥
| k |

p

where k⊥ is the component of k perpendicular to z-
−(g/ρ0)∂ρ/∂z is the constant buoyancy (or
axis, N =
Brunt-V¨ais¨al¨a) frequency, ρ(z) the ﬂuid density at alti-
tude z, g = 981 cm/s2 the acceleration of gravity, and
ρ0 ≃ 1 g/cm3 a reference density. Thus, from Eq. (1),
the wave frequency, ω = 2πf , determines the inclination
angle β of the phase surfaces with the vertical, and not
the magnitude of the wave vector k. From Eq. (1), β is
also the angle between the group velocity cg = ∂ω/∂k
and the horizontal, since cg ⊥ k. Thus, for a given strat-
iﬁcation and frequency, internal waves of low (higher)
frequency propagate at low (steeper) angle.

The outward radiation of energy is thus along four
beams oriented at an angle β with the horizontal, the fa-
miliar St Andrews Cross structure [20]. The beam prop-
agating directly toward the slope has been singled out by
adding a grid on the surface of water. This grid strongly
damps the three other wave beams that propagate to-
wards the free surface, and thereby prevents reﬂection of
such beams. A planar wave pattern consisting of parallel
rays is thus generated from the wavemaker. Although it
is well-known that the spatial spectrum of waves gener-
ated by an oscillating cylinder is large [15, 21, 22], it has

2

been experimentally checked that the dominant wave-
length is approximately equal to the cylinder diameter
(see below). Moreover, measurements conﬁrm that the
low vibrational amplitudes of cylinder do not inﬂuence
strongly the wavelength generated.

Diﬀerent visualization methods are used to study the
reﬂection mechanism of such internal gravity waves by
a boundary layer. First, the usual shadowgraph tech-
nique [23] allows visualization of the qualitative and
global 2D evolution of the incident and reﬂected waves. It
involves projecting a point source of light through strat-
iﬁed water onto a screen behind the tank. The optical
refractive index variations induced by the ﬂuid density
variations, allows to observe isodensity lines (or isopyc-
nals) on the screen, located perpendicularly to the light
source and parallel to the longest wall tank. It is there-
fore possible to measure the group velocity angle, β, and
the phase velocity vϕ of the incident wave. For various
frequencies of excitation, 0.2 ≤ f ≤ 0.5 Hz, the angle β
of the St Andrews Cross is measured on a screen lead-
ing to a linear relation between ω and sin β as predicted
by Eq. (1) with a slope of N = 3.1 ± 0.1 rad/s, for the
stratiﬁed ﬂuid prepared as above. This value is in good
agreement with the above static one obtained from the
density proﬁle with a conductimetric probe. The cut-
oﬀ frequency is then fc = N/(2π) ≃ 0.5 Hz. By time
of ﬂight measurements between signals delivered by two
photodiodes, 1 cm apart, each of 7 mm2 area, located
along the propagation direction, a value vϕ = 0.6 ± 0.4
cm/s was obtained for an excitation frequency f = 0.25
Hz. When these signals are cross-correlated by means of
an spectrum analyzer, the averaged dephasing time leads
to vϕ = 0.7 ± 0.3 cm/s, close to the previous value. The
wavelength of the incident wave is thus λ = vϕ/f ≃ 3
cm, corresponding as expected to the oscillating cylin-
der’s diameter. However, neither this shadowgraph tech-
nique nor one [23] using passive tracers (ﬂuorescein dye)
is suﬃciently sensitive to observe quantitative and local
internal wave properties closed to the reﬂective boundary
layer.

Accordingly, the classical Schlieren method [23, 24] of
visualization has been used. Let us just note that behind
the tank, the light beam is refocused by a lens a small
distance after a slit (instead of the usual knife blade to
increase contrast) to ﬁlter the rays. The slit is oriented
orthogonally to the slope generating straight horizontal
fringe lines in the case of no excitation. The image of the
observation ﬁeld (strongly dependent of the 7.5 cm diam-
eter lens) is focused on the screen by a last lens. The in-
ternal wave, producing density disturbances, causes lines
to distort, this distorting line pattern being recorded by
a camera. Note that this experimental technique is sen-
sitive to the index gradient, and therefore to the density
gradient, orthogonal to the slit, i.e. parallel to the slope.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND
COMPARISON WITH THEORY

The Schlieren technique allows to carefully observe
quantitative and local internal wave properties during the
reﬂection process. Critical reﬂection arises when an inci-
dent wave beam with an angle of propagation β reﬂects
oﬀ the slope of angle γ ≃ β, the reﬂected wave being then
trapped along the plane slope. This corresponds to a crit-
ical frequency fc = N sin γ ≃ 0.28 ± 0.01 Hz, N being
equal to 3.1 ± 0.1 rad/s for all experiments. It is possible
to observe that the isodensity lines (isopycnals), initially
horizontal without excitation, are bent for an excitation
near fc (0.78 ≤ f /fc ≤ 1.14), and fold over themselves
along the length of the slope. Figures 2 show a time
sequence of constant density surfaces, depicting sequen-
tial snapshots of the ﬂow throughout one period of its
development. These pictures show strikingly the distor-
tion of the isopycnals in the slightly subcritical case with
f /fc = 0.78. In panel (a), the density disturbance is very
small and one can observe essentially the initial horizon-
tal background stratiﬁcation. This background stratiﬁ-
cation, usually obtained with dye ﬂuorescein, should be
invisible with this schlieren method. However, as pre-
viously reported by MacPhee and Kunze [16], the com-
parison between shadowgraph and Dye ﬂuorescein visu-
alizations allows to identify these lines with isopycnals.
In panel (b), the disturbance generated by the incident
wave breaking against the slope begins to ‘fold-up’ the
isopycnals. As time progresses (see panel c), wave over-
turning develops around a front: The buoyancy becomes
statically unstable. This overturned region climbs along
the slope as time continues, and the folded isopycnals col-
lapse into turbulence that mixes the density ﬁeld within
the breaking region (see panel d). The maximum thick-
ness of this reﬂected disturbance is of the order of 5 mm,
and decreases with time as theoretically predicted [5]. Fi-
nally, the ﬂow begins to relaminarize (panel e). One can
check that panels (a) and (f) are almost identical, show-
ing that the ﬂow is entirely restratiﬁed (panel f) after one
period of excitation.

Figures 2 have been analyzed with an image processing
software (Scion-Image) to extract the isopycnals from the
pictures. A typical experimental result for the distortion
of isopycnals is reported in Fig. 3a, and is compared with
a theoretical result in Fig. 3b. The analytic solution of
the density ﬁeld of the initial value problem in the critical
case reads [5]

J1 being the Bessel function, ω+ the positive solution
of Eq. (1), ψ the maximum amplitude of the stream-
function and x the horizontal coordinate. Figure 3 show
a good qualitative agreement between experimental and
theoretical results, the value for the time t being arbitrar-
ily chosen. Far from the slope, the density disturbance is
very small and one sees essentially the initial background
stratiﬁcation. Closer to the slope, the disturbance folds
up the isopycnals, and this produces a region of static
instability.

Recording several isopycnals and using image process-
ing, it is also possible to follow the temporal evolution
of a single isopycnal during its overturning. As this phe-
nomenon is periodic with a period T = 1/f , it is possible
to reconstruct from this temporal evolution the density
proﬁle picture at a given time t. This allows to follow
the position, and therefore the propagation velocity of
the front along the slope at diﬀerent times. The front is
deﬁned as the inﬂexion point (represented by the star in
Fig. 3b) of the followed isopycnal. Figure 4a shows, dur-
ing two periods, the isopycnal front position along the
slope as a function of time. The periodic evolution of
this front position is clearly observed, and the local slope
of curves in Fig. 4a allows to roughly measure the front
velocity as a function of time, as reported in Fig. 4b.

The front velocity from its creation to its collapsing in-
creases from 0.5 cm/s up to 3 cm/s. The front has thus
traveled roughly 4 cm in one period (∼ 4.5 s). This leads
to an averaged front velocity in agreement with the phase
speed measurement obtained from the shadowgraph vi-
sualizations.

The wavemaker frequency is now increased up to f =
0.32 Hz, to have an incident planewave tilted with an
angle β steeper than the slope angle γ. In this slightly
supercritical case (f /fc = 1.14), intrusions are still ob-
served, but the density ﬁeld doesn’t fold up so abruptly
and does not lead anymore to overturning instability (see
Fig. 5). Except the value of the frequency f , all others
parameter values have been kept identical to the ones
in Fig. 2. The instant of this snapshot has been chosen
when the isopycnal distortion is the largest [25]. This
distortion is clearly far from leading to an overturning in-
stability as encountered in the subcritical case of Fig. 2c:
The reﬂected wave is not trapped along the slope in the
boundary layer, and consequently the isopycnals are not
overturned. Moreover the density front velocity is mea-
sured roughly constant, 0.5 cm/s, during two periods of
vibration. Both diﬀerences conﬁrm that the singularity
appears only in the critical case [5].

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

The Schlieren technique allows us to study the spa-
tiotemporal evolution of the internal waves reﬂection
close to the critical reﬂection, where nonlinear processes
occur. The dynamics of isopycnals is then found in agree-
ment with a recent nonlinear theory [5]. Moreover, this

Panel (d) of Fig. 2 is characteristic of the onset of turbu-
lence triggered by overturning instability near the slope.
This turbulent mechanism is likely responsible for the
formation of highly “stepped” temperature proﬁles near
steep slopes in lakes [26]. Moreover, the formation of sus-
pended sediment layers, called nepheloid layers, at conti-
nental slopes has been linked to critical angle reﬂection of
internal waves [16, 27], and suggests that this reﬂection
process plays an important role in the seawards trans-
port of sediments in the ﬂuid. A possible extension of

for the transition to boundary-layer turbulence responsi-

then overturns with small-scale ﬂuctuations inside [16].

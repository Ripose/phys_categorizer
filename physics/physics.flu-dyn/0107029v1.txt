Abstract

Non-linear behavior of an MHD system with ABC forcing under pe-
riodic boundary conditions is considered. Most computations are per-
formed for a ﬁxed kinematic Reynolds number and magnetic Reynolds
numbers increasing from 0 to 60. The kinematic Reynolds number
is small enough for the trivial solution with a zero magnetic ﬁeld to
be stable to velocity perturbations. At the critical magnetic Reynolds
number for the onset of instability of the trivial solution the dominant
eigenvalue of the kinematic dynamo problem is real. In agreement with
the bifurcation theory new steady states with non-vanishing magnetic
ﬁeld appear in this bifurcation. Subsequent bifurcations are investi-
gated. A regime is detected, where chaotic variations of the magnetic
ﬁeld direction (analogous to magnetic ﬁeld reversals) are observed in
the temporal evolution of the system.

1 Introduction

The MHD system of equations is invariant under the symmetry preserving
ﬂows v and changing the sign of magnetic ﬁelds b:

h : (v, b) → (v, −b).

(1)

Temporal behavior involving magnetic ﬁeld reversals, similar to those of the

Earth magnetic ﬁeld, can develop in a system with such a symmetry. The

following scenario can be anticipated. Suppose for some values of a control

parameter the system possesses a stable steady state, in which magnetic ﬁeld

vanishes. When the parameter varies, two steady states with a non-vanishing

magnetic ﬁeld emerge in a pitchfork bifurcation (generic to systems with the

symmetry (1) ). In subsequent bifurcations the steady states bifurcate into

more complex attractors, remaining so far two distinct attractors related by

(1). As the parameter varies further, the former attractors degenerate into

invariant sets repelling in some directions, the attractor of the system becomes

unique, and a trajectory on attractor jumps between the sets. Jumps involve

changes in the magnetic ﬁeld direction, and the resulting intermittency can

thus be linked with the reversals. Our goal is to inspect, whether this scenario

is feasible.

Reversals were observed in simulations of MHD systems with the geometry

and boundary conditions corresponding to those of the Earth, see e.g. [1,2].

However, such computations are very demanding in CPU time, prohibiting

numerical identiﬁcation of complex bifurcations in that system.

We consider the Navier-Stokes equation

Rm

∇ · v = 0, ∇ · b = 0.

(2.b)

(2.c)

Here v is ﬂow velocity, b – magnetic ﬁeld, p – pressure, R and Rm are kine-
matic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. (Since in the problem under consid-

eration characteristic length and velocity magnitudes are of the order of unity,

2

(3)

(5)

the Reynolds numbers are deﬁned as inverse viscosity and inverse magnetic

diﬀusivity, respectively.) The ﬁelds are supposed to be 2π-periodic in space.

The force

f = u0/R

is assumed, where u0 is an ABC ﬂow

u0 = (A sin x3 + C cos x2, B sin x1 + A cos x3, C sin x2 + B cos x1).

(4)

For this force,

v = u0, b = 0

is a steady solution to (2)-(4) for all Reynolds numbers.

This particular system is considered for the following reasons: First, space

periodicity enables one to use pseudo-spectral methods [3-5], which are com-

putationally less demanding than other numerical methods. Second, linear

stability of the system (2)-(5) to hydrodynamic [6-8] and magnetic [9-12]

perturbations was investigated both numerically and analytically (nonlinear

regimes for some parameter values were also explored, see [7,8,12-14] and ref-

erences therein). These studies provide guidance, in what parameter ranges

the targeted type of behavior may be observed. In particular, growing mag-

netic modes exist for the ﬂow (3) in broad intervals of constants A, B and

C [10,11]. Third, since the critical magnetic Reynolds number is typically of
the order of 10, only moderate Rm need to be considered, and a relatively low
resolution (323 Fourier harmonics) suﬃces.

Magnetic ﬁeld growth rates were calculated in [12] for the ﬂow (4) with
the coeﬃcients satisfying B = C, A2 + B2 + C 2 = 3, 0 < B/A < 1 for various
values of Rm. For Rm = 12 there are three windows in B/A of positive growth
rates ([12], Fig. 2). We have checked that in the window 0.7 < B/A < 0.9

the dominant eigenvalue is real, and in the other two windows it is complex.

Distinct steady states with a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld appear in a bifurcation

of the trivial steady state (5), only if the magnetic induction operator has a

zero (hence real) eigenvalue at the bifurcation point. This has suggested to

set

A = 1, B = C = 0.75;

(6)

these values of constants in (4) are assumed throughout.

In the present study we focus at non-hydrodynamic attractors. The hydro-
dynamic global stability of u0 guarantees that magnetic ﬁeld does not vanish

3

in saturated regime, if v = u0 is a kinematic dynamo. We have veriﬁed that
for R = 4, v = u0 is a unique attractor of the hydrodynamic system ( (2.a,2.c)
with b = 0), and most computations are made for this value of R. Several
runs are also performed for higher R.

A perturbation of the trivial steady state (5) with the energy of 10−6 in
each Fourier harmonics spherical shell is employed as an initial condition. The

range of existence of attractors is determined by continuation in parameter:

the runs are done with an initial condition, which is a point on the attractor
for close values of Rm.

and the identity transformation s8 = e [7,15,16]. The group is isomorphic to
the symmetry group of a square, D4.

Any symmetry of the force (3),(4) which does not involve inversion of time
is also a symmetry of the Navier-Stokes equation (2.a) with b = 0. The group
of symmetries of the MHD system (2)-(4),(6) is a direct product of G and the
2-element group Z2, generated by h (1). It has 16 elements, which are either
si or hsi.

Let A be an attractor of a dynamical system, invariant under a symmetry
g: g(A) = A. Two cases can be distinguished: either A is pointwise invariant,
i.e. g(x) = x for all points x ∈ A, or it is invariant only as a set, with g(x) 6= x
for some x ∈ A. In what follows, only the symmetries for which an attractor
is pointwise invariant are regarded as symmetries of the attractor.

3 Attractors of the MHD system for R = 4

Results of computations are summarized in Table 1. For 15 ≤ Rm ≤ 58 the
system under consideration possesses multiple attractors. For 16 ≤ Rm ≤ 58
attractors, which we have detected, belong to two independent families; within

each family they are genetically related by sequences of bifurcations. Attrac-

tors from diﬀerent families have distinct groups of symmetries. The families
can be distinguished also by their time-averaged kinetic (Ek) and magnetic
(Em) energies: 0.9 < Ek < 1.1, 0 ≤ Em < 0.05 for the ﬁrst family, and
0.3 < Ek < 0.7, 0.07 < Em < 0.25 for the second one.

5

The ﬁrst family exists for 0 ≤ Rm ≤ 58: the ﬁrst attractor is the trivial
steady state (5) (denoted by S0) remaining stable up to2 Rm = 14. It becomes
unstable in a pitchfork bifurcation, in which two stable mutually symmet-
ric steady states (S1,1 and S1,2) with a non-zero magnetic ﬁeld emerge. The
8-element symmetry group of S1,i is isomorphic to D4; however, it is distinct
from G.

The second family emerges between Rm = 15 and Rm = 16: in addition to
the steady states S1,i, for Rm ≥ 16 the system possesses another attractor, a
stable periodic orbit P1. The orbit does not exist for Rm = 15; apparently it
appears in a saddlenode bifurcation. For Rm = 26 the orbit is unstable and a
torus T1 has appeared in a Hopf bifurcation. T1 remains an attractor for all
higher considered Rm (speciﬁcally, for Rm = 26, 27, 30, 40, 57 and 60). For
Rm ≥ 57 the torus attracts trajectories (in the phase space) initially close to
the trivial steady state S0, and for Rm ≥ 58 it is the only global attractor of
the system. The torus T1 and the orbit P1 were traced back from Rm = 57
by continuation in Rm.
In what follows we will not discuss this family of
attractors any more.

The steady states S1,i become unstable in a supercritical Hopf bifurcation at
the interval 24 < Rm < 25. A stable periodic orbit P2,i of period ≈ 12 appears
in a vicinity of the steady state S1,i. The two orbits are mutually symmetric
(they are interrelated by (1) ). Each periodic orbit possesses all 8 symmetries of

its parent steady state, but each individual point of the orbit has a symmetry
group of only 4 elements (it is isomorphic to D2). At Rm = 30, after an
initially small magnetic energy at ﬁrst exponentially grows and afterwards

decays with oscillations, it subsequently levels oﬀ (see a plateau about 400

time units long on Fig. 1a): the trajectory in the phase space evolves in a
vicinity of S1,i (which is unstable now). In the further evolution the trajectory
leaves the steady state, being attracted by P2,i (see Fig. 1b). The orbits exist
for 25 ≤ Rm ≤ 37 remaining attracting, and they disappear in a subcritical
Hopf bifurcation between Rm = 37 and Rm = 37.5 . For Rm = 37.5, 38 and
38.5 the two steady states S1,i are veriﬁed to be stable.

Next bifurcation of S1,i is again a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The

the two steady states) possess all the symmetries of the steady states. For
39 ≤ Rm ≤ 39.2 they are attracting, and their period is τ (P 1
3,i) ≈ 120. Behav-
ior of a sample trajectory in the phase space resembles the one shown on Fig. 1;

however, on Fig. 2a the plateau corresponding to the evolution in the vicinity
of the unstable steady state S1,i virtually disappears, and the period is much
larger. The orbit is located in a diﬀerent region of the phase space (cf. Fig. 1b
and Fig. 2b). At an Rm between 39.2 and 39.3 two mutually symmetric orbits
P 2
3,i (i = 1, 2) of a twice larger period emerge (see Fig. 3a). A sequence of
period-doubling bifurcations begins. The next period doubling occurs at the
interval 39.4 < Rm < 39.45 (see period-four orbit P 4
3,i for Rm = 39.45 on
Fig. 3b). At Rm = 39.5 a trajectory, initially close to S0, is either already
chaotic, or close to an orbit of a very long period P ∞
3,i (see Fig. 3c). This indi-
cates that at Rm = 39.5 the period-doubling cascade is over. For Rm = 39.6
a trajectory with the same initial condition is attracted to a period-one orbit
P 1
3,i.

Another attractor exists for Rm = 39.6 . It reveals itself when the attractor
for Rm = 39.7, which is unique in this region of the phase space (see below) is
continued in smaller Rm. This is a periodic orbit P4, involving transitions be-
tween the two period-two orbits P 2
3,i (see Fig. 4a). The orbit is invariant under
h (1) and any symmetry from G. In the course of temporal evolution, direc-
tion of magnetic ﬁeld is reversed, behavior of non-zero magnetic ﬁeld Fourier

coeﬃcients is similar to that shown on Fig. 4b. A reversal takes a relatively

short time, during which initially the energy of magnetic ﬁeld attains the mini-

mum and kinetic – the maximum, and subsequently magnetic energy blows up

to a maximum, with the kinetic energy simultaneously reaching its minimum

(Fig. 4c,d). No attractor of this type is revealed by further continuation in
smaller Rm.

try, which maps one of the periodic orbits to another. Under this symmetry

the heteroclinic trajectory is mapped to a distinct heteroclinic trajectory, and

the two form a heteroclinic cycle. The cycle may give rise to a periodic orbit

7

P4, when the control parameter varies. (This scenario is analogous to that

in two-dimensional dynamical systems, where a homoclinic connection gener-

ically implies for close values of the control parameter existence of periodic

orbits in a vicinity of the homoclinic trajectory, and their period tends to

inﬁnity when the critical value is approached.)

For 39.7 ≤ Rm ≤ 41 sample trajectories, initially close to the trivial steady
state S0, are attracted by the periodic orbit P4. However, while for Rm = 39.6
such a trajectory follows closely each of P 2
3,i (Fig. 4a), this is not the case any
more for higher Rm (see Fig. 5). In agreement with our conjecture that ap-
pearance of the orbit is related to heteroclinic connection, the period decreases
from 800 for Rm = 39.7 to 500 for Rm = 41.

For Rm = 42 and 43 the regime is quasi-periodic: the orbit P4 bifurcates
into two attracting tori T2,i (i = 1, 2) interrelated by (1) (see Fig. 6). The
second frequency can be observed on Fig. 6a, showing real part of the Fourier
component b3
0,1,1 of magnetic ﬁeld. The time average of this Fourier compo-
nent is negative (Fig. 6a); hence, the symmetry (1) maps this attractor to
a distinct one. (For 37.5 ≤ Rm ≤ 41 the component vanishes, because for-
mer attractors [P4 for 39.6 ≤ Rm ≤ 41, P m
3,i for 39 ≤ Rm ≤ 39.6, and S1,i
for 37.5 ≤ Rm ≤ 38.5] possess the symmetry hs5 = hs1s2.) Note qualitatively
diﬀerent behavior (Figs. 6a and 6b) of diﬀerent Fourier coeﬃcients of the mag-
netic ﬁeld (for Rm ≤ 41 all non-zero components evolved coherently).

For Rm = 45 two mutually symmetric attractors persist (Fig. 7): each
torus T2,i bifurcates into a chaotic attractor C2,i. Reversals are less regular,
yet they are too ordered in comparison with those of the Earth’s magnetic

ﬁeld.

For Rm = 46 (Fig. 8) behavior of a sample trajectory suggests existence of
four (unstable) steady states S2,i (see plateaux at 1500 ≤ t ≤ 2100). They are
mutually symmetric, and have the same 4-element symmetry group generated
by hs1 and s3. Apparently two S2,i’s emerged from each S1,i in a pitchfork bi-
furcation. Initially (at 0 ≤ t < 700) the sample trajectory for Rm = 46 under-
goes several reversals, similar in nature to those observed for 39.7 ≤ Rm ≤ 45.
Afterwards it is attracted to a steady state S2,i. Subsequent sample evolution
consists of transitions between the steady state S2,i and the region of the phase
space where a former chaotic attractor C2,i was located (duration of repeat-
ing events in the saturated regime is ≈ 1700). In particular, large-amplitude
excursions at 2350 ≤ t ≤ 2500, 2300 ≤ t ≤ 2450, 4000 ≤ t ≤ 4150, etc., are

8

reminiscent of the behavior of a C2,i trajectory for Rm = 45. Thus, apparently
two former chaotic attractors C2,i have disappeared in collision with the four
steady states S2,i to give rise to four new chaotic attractors C3,i. It is notable
that the sample trajectory leaves a vicinity of the S2,i in alternating directions
along the unstable manifold. For Rm = 47 the behavior is similar to the one
at Rm = 46.

For Rm = 48 the system possesses four mutually symmetric attractors
C4,i. Events are longer than in the previous regime, about 3000 time units
(see Fig. 9). They exhibit a new feature, a phase of initially exponentially
decaying oscillations (e.g. at 1700 ≤ t ≤ 2300 and 4500 ≤ t ≤ 5200). This
indicates existence of a weakly unstable periodic orbit of a new kind, P5,i
(i = 1, 4), in a vicinity of the former chaotic attractor C3,i. A similar behavior
is also observed for Rm = 49.

For Rm = 50, 51 (Fig. 10) the four C4,i are superceded by two new attrac-
tors, C5,i. Large amplitude oscillations, e.g. at 7500 ≤ t ≤ 8500, are due
to attraction of the trajectory by weakly unstable tori T3,i (i = 1, 4), which
have bifurcated from the periodic orbits P5,i. In the saturated regime behavior
consists of three phases: (i) a trajectory is close to a periodic orbit P5,i (e.g.
at 2300 ≤ t ≤ 3000 and 4300 ≤ t ≤ 5000); (ii) the trajectory evolves in the
vicinity of a torus T3,i (e.g. at 3200 ≤ t ≤ 4000 and 5300 ≤ t ≤ 6000); (iii) the
trajectory abruptly jumps toward the second periodic orbit P5,i′ to reproduce
the sequence of phases.

For Rm = 52 each of the two former chaotic attractors splits into two
attracting tori T3,i (Fig. 11; cf. Figs. 10b and 11b). The four new attractors
are mutually symmetric, they are stable for 52 ≤ Rm ≤ 58.

For 57 ≤ Rm ≤ 60 a sample trajectory initially close to S0 is attracted by

the torus T1.

4 Attractors of the MHD system for Rm = 40.

We do not perform analysis for other values of R in such detail, as for R = 4.
Runs are made for Rm = 40 and only for several values of R with an initial
condition, same for all runs, being a small perturbation of S0. The question

we address is how the behavior changes with R, in particular, if reversals are

present for higher R and whether magnetic ﬁeld decays in saturated regime

for moderate R. Results of computations are summarized in Table 2. Com-

putations with the same R and the same initial condition for the ﬂow are also

performed for the purely hydrodynamic system (2.a), in order to compare the

temporal behavior and attractors of the two systems.

For R = 3 the detected attractor is the torus T1 (which is an attractor for
R = 4 and 26 ≤ Rm ≤ 60). For R = 6 reversals take place, similar to those
observed for R = 4 and Rm = 45, and the attractor is C2,i. Thus, for R close
to 4 no new attractors are found.

For R = 10 a new attractor was found in the full MHD system – a periodic

orbit P6 with a symmetry group of 8 elements. Comparison of Tables 2 and

10

3 reveals no relation of attractors of the hydrodynamic and MHD systems

for R = 10, 15 and 20. For these Reynolds numbers a small magnetic ﬁeld
(magnetic energy Em is below 0.07; see Table 2) drastically changes behavior of
the system – the hydrodynamic and MHD systems have attractors of diﬀerent
types, and the average kinetic energy Ek decreases signiﬁcantly, e.g. for R = 20
Em = 0.01 and Ek decreases from 0.9 (the hydrodynamic case) to 0.7 (the
MHD case).

For R = 15 behavior of the sample trajectory of the MHD system in

saturated regime is chaotic. But before the saturated regime sets in, the
trajectory is attracted by P6 and for 1000 ≤ t ≤ 2000 remains close to this
periodic orbit (see Fig. 12), which is now weakly unstable. For R = 20 the
trajectory with the same initial condition is attracted to a new torus T4,i;
initially the temporal behavior of the trajectory resembles the one observed

for R = 15 (cf. Figs. 12 and 13).

For R = 25 the MHD system possesses new chaotic attractors C7,i (i = 1, 2)
with a trivial symmetry group. They resemble the chaotic attractor C6 ob-
served for R = 15 (cf. Fig. 12 and Fig. 14), but unlike C7,i, C6 is unique and
has a symmetry group of four elements. Comparison of C7,i with the attractor
of the non-magnetic Navier-Stokes equation, which also is chaotic, reveals that

the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁeld is in some sense stabilizing: Fourier coeﬃcients

of the ﬂow experience fewer jumps and the amplitude of their oscillations is

much smaller (compare Fourier components of ﬂows on Figs. 14b and 15b). An

exponential growth of the initially small magnetic ﬁeld in the sample evolution

of the system begins only at t = 200 (Fig. 14c). Accordingly, until t = 300 the

ﬂow evolution is similar to the one in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetic

ﬁeld starts growing, when the trajectory is attracted by a weakly unstable pe-

riodic orbit in the hydrodynamic subspace. Departure from this orbit causes

an initial decay of magnetic ﬁeld before the onset of saturated behavior.

For R = 15 and 20 behavior of Fourier components of magnetic ﬁeld is

similar to the one shown on Fig. 14d. It consists of chaotic irregular small-

period oscillations about zero, quite diﬀerent from the behavior observed for
R = 4. Thus for Rm = 40, 15 ≤ R ≤ 25 the considered system is not in a
regime resembling reversals.

5 Conclusion

Our computations show that magnetic ﬁeld reversals are not an uncommon

feature of a nonlinear dynamical system of magnetohydrodynamic type, at

least in some region of parameter values. The dissimilarity with the Earth

reversals is not very surprising, since we consider a simpliﬁed set of equations

(neither account of thermal or sedimentation-driven convection is taken, nor

that of the Coriolis force) in an idealized space-periodic geometry.

The bifurcation scenario leading to emergence of reversals, which we put

forward, proved feasible. Reversals were found only for small R, for which the

hydrodynamic system has a unique globally stable steady state. Complexity

of the sequence of bifurcations obtained in simulations is comparable to that

of the hydrodynamic system studied in [7,8]. Numerous types of behavior are

identiﬁed, which involve a large variety of attractors and unstable invariant

sets of various types inﬂuencing behavior of evolutionary solutions. Regime

of reversals arises following merging of two distinct attractors, the underlying

mechanism is apparently based on heteroclinic connection – we continue to

investigate it.

An analytic study of other global bifurcations observed here is required, in
particular, of how chaotic attractors C2,i, C3,i, C4,i and C5,i are related. It is
desirable to make a more detailed numerical analysis of bifurcations occurring
in the regions on the (R, Rm) plane, which are not explored in the present
work.

Rotations and cessations of the large-scale
circulation in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard
convection

By Eric Brown and Guenter Ahlers

Department of Physics and iQCD, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106

(Received 2 February 2008)

We present a broad range of measurements of the angular orientation θ0(t) of the large-
scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection as a function of time. We
used two cylindrical samples of diﬀerent overall sizes, but each with its diameter nearly
equal to its height. The ﬂuid was water with a Prandtl number of 4.38. The time series
θ0(t) consisted of meanderings similar to a diﬀusive process, but in addition contained
large and irregular spontaneous reorientation events through angles ∆θ. We found that
reorientations can occur by two distinct mechanisms. One consists of a rotation of the
circulation plane without any major reduction of the circulation strength. The other
involves a cessation of the circulation, followed by a restart in a randomly chosen new
direction. Rotations occurred an order of magnitude more frequently than cessations.
Rotations occurred with a monotonically decreasing probability distribution p(∆θ), i.e.
there was no dominant value of ∆θ and small ∆θ were more common than large ones. For
cessations p(∆θ) was uniform, suggesting that information of θ0(t) before the cessation
is lost. Both rotations and cessations have Poissonian statistics in time, and can occur
at any θ0. The average azimuthal rotation rate
increased as the circulation strength
of the LSC decreased. Tilting the sample relative to gravity signiﬁcantly reduced the
frequency of occurrence of both rotations and cessations.

1. Introduction

≡

The problem of Rayleigh-B´enard convection (RBC) consists of a ﬂuid sample heated
from below [for example, see Siggia(1994), Kadanoﬀ(2001), Ahlers et al. (2002)]. The
heat drives a convective ﬂow and is thus transported out the top of the sample. In
our case the sample is a cylindrical container ﬁlled with water. This system is deﬁned
αg∆T L3/κν (α is the isobaric thermal
by three parameters: the Rayleigh number R
expansion coeﬃcient, g the acceleration of gravity, ∆T the applied temperature diﬀerence,
L the height of the sample, κ the thermal diﬀusivity, and ν the kinematic viscosity), the
Prandtl number σ
D/L (D is the diameter of the
sample). Convection happens as a result of the emission of volumes of hot ﬂuid known as
“plumes” from a bottom thermal boundary layer that rise due to a buoyant force, while
cold plumes emitted from a top boundary layer sink. In the turbulent regime of Γ = 1
samples that we study, these plumes drive a large-scale circulation (LSC) [Krishnamurty
& Howard(1981), Sano et al. (1989), Castaing et al. (1989), Ciliberto et al.(1997), Qiu
& Tong (2001a), Funfschilling & Ahlers (2004), Sun et al. (2005), Tsuji et al. (2005)],
also known as the “mean wind”, which is oriented nearly vertically with up-ﬂow and
down-ﬂow on opposite sides of the sample.

The LSC conﬁguration does not have the rotational invariance of the cylindrical sam-
ple, but the cylindrical symmetry implies that any azimuthal orientation θ0 of the LSC is
an equally valid state for the system. In this paper we present extensive measurements of
spontaneous angular changes ∆θ of θ0, i.e. of reorientations of the LSC. Such changes have
been observed previously [Keller(1966), Welander (1967), Creveling et al. (1975), Gorman
et al.(1984), Hansen et al.(1992), Cioni et al.(1997), Niemela et al. (2001), Furukawa &
Onuki (2002), Sreenivasan et al. (2002), Brown et al. (2005b), Sun et al. (2005), Xi et al.
(2006)]. In one case, a rotation of the entire structure through an angle of ∆θ
1/2 rev-
olution without a signiﬁcant change in ﬂow speed was clearly observed in an experiment
using mercury as the ﬂuid [Cioni et al.(1997)]. Another conceivable mechanism is cessa-
tion, in which the LSC ﬂow-speed vanishes, and then the ﬂow restarts in a diﬀerent direc-
tion. Cessation was observed in numerical simulations [Hansen et al.(1992), Furukawa &
Onuki (2002)], a dynamical-systems model [Araujo et al. (2005)], and a stochastic model
[Benzi (2005)]. All of these cases are two-dimensional models where only cessations with
∆θ = 1/2 revolution are possible, although in principle the models could be extended
to three dimensions. Cessation also occurs in convection loops (a thin circular vertically
oriented loop ﬁlled with ﬂuid heated in the lower and cooled in the upper half) where be-
cause of the two-dimensional nature again only cessations with ∆θ = 1/2 revolution are
possible [Keller(1966), Welander (1967), Creveling et al. (1975), Gorman et al.(1984)].

The experimental work by Niemela et al. (2001) and subsequent analysis by Sreeni-
vasan et al. (2002) yielded statistics relating to reversals of the LSC, but could not
determine ∆θ and was unable to distinguish between the rotation and cessation mech-
anisms. Cessations were ﬁrst documented in a laboratory sample of turbulent RBC by
Brown et al. (2005b), and the present paper presents more extensive analysis and addi-
tional data from that project. Recent experiments in Γ = 0.5 samples [Sun et al. (2005)]
measured the orientation of the LSC, and contemporary experiments in Γ = 1 samples
[Xi et al. (2006)] have produced results complementary to our own regarding the az-
imuthal dynamics of the LSC. With these experiments, the azimuthal dynamics of the
LSC are beginning to be understood. Spontaneous changes of the orientation of the LSC
are not only interesting from the standpoint of fundamental physics, but are important in
many geophysical applications. For instance, reversals occur in natural convection of the
Earth’s atmosphere [Doorn et al. (2000)]. Convection dynamics in the outer core of the
Earth are responsible for changes in the orientation of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld [Glatzmaier
et al. (1999)].

The goal of the present work is to better understand the reorientations of the LSC, by
both the rotation and cessation mechanisms. We ﬁrst explain the experiment and how we
determine θ0 in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we illustrate the existence and nature of both rotations
and cessations. In Sect. 4 we present statistics relating to reorientations of the LSC,
showing that successive rotations are independent of each other, and that they result in
a wide range of ∆θ, in which strict reversals (∆θ
1/2 rev.) are not especially common.
In Sect. 5 we present statistics relating to cessations. These are found to be an order of
magnitude more rare than rotations. We show that after the LSC stops, it restarts with a
random new orientation. In Sect. 6 we compare our results with those of Sreenivasan and
coworkers. There we show that we can reproduce the statistics that they derived from
their data only when we count an event each time when the orientation crosses a ﬁxed
angle. We refer to such events as “crossings”. Crossings include events caused by small-
amplitude, high-frequency “jitter” near the crossing angle, and considering them resolves
apparent inconsistencies between the two experiments. In Sect. 7 we present statistics of
the azimuthal rotation rate over the long term. There we show that the angular distance
travelled by θ0 scales as in a diﬀusive process, and that the absolute value of the rotation

increases when the LSC amplitude decreases. In Sect. 8 we present results from
rate
tilting the sample relative to gravity. These data complement results already reported
by Ahlers et al. (2005). Since naturally occurring convection systems are generally not
cylindrically symmetric, it is important to study how rotations and cessations behave in
less symmetric systems. As observed by others (see, for instance, Sun et al. (2005) and
references therein), we ﬁnd that the tilt pushes the LSC into a preferred orientation along
the direction of the tilt. In addition, we determined that both rotations and cessations
are strongly suppressed by the tilt. Finally in Sect. 9, we comment on the contemporary
experiments by Xi et al. (2006), who reported on the azimuthal dynamics of the LSC,
and compare the results to ours. A brief summary is given in Sect. 10.

Because the theoretical models [Araujo et al. (2005), Benzi (2005)] only predict two-
dimensional reversals, and not the three-dimensional rotations and cessations that we
observe, they cannot yet be compared in detail to the experimental data.

2. The apparatus and experimental method

×

≃

The experiments were done with two cylindrical samples with aspect ratio Γ

1 that
are the medium and large sample described in detail elsewhere [Brown et al. (2005a)].
Both had circular copper top and bottom plates with a plexiglas side wall that ﬁt into a
groove in each plate. There were no internal ﬂanges, seams, sensors, or other structures
that could interfere with the ﬂuid ﬂow. The medium sample had D = 24.81 cm and
L = 24.76 cm, and the large sample had D = 49.67 cm and L = 50.61 cm. Each sample
was ﬁlled with water and the average temperature between the bottom and top plates
was kept at 40.0◦ C where σ = 4.38. The two samples of diﬀerent heights allowed us
to cover a larger range of R at the same σ and Γ, so the overall range studied was
108 <∼ R <∼ 1011. Three rows of eight blind holes each, equally spaced azimuthally and
3
lined up vertically with each other at heights 3L/4, L/2, and L/4, were drilled from the
outside into the side walls of both samples. Thermistors were placed into them so as to
be within d = 0.07 cm of the ﬂuid surface. Earlier experiments were done with only the
middle row of eight thermistors at height L/2, and presentations of data in this paper
that mention only one row of measurements refer to the middle row, which was sampled
in both the early and later experiments. Since the LSC carried warm (cold) ﬂuid from the
bottom (top) plate up (down) the side wall, these thermistors detected the location of
the upﬂow (downﬂow) of the LSC by indicating a relatively high (low) temperature. No
parts of the thermistors extended into the sample where they might have perturbed the
ﬂow structure of the ﬂuid. The lead wires for these thermistors were wrapped around the
insulating layers just outside the side wall to prevent the introduction of heat currents
into the sides of the samples from these leads. The thermistors have a resolution of 10−3
degrees C. Both samples were carefully levelled to better than 0.001 rad, except for the
experiments in which we deliberately tilted the samples.

We presume that the side-wall thermistors measured the temperature of the thermal
plumes and the accompanying LSC, just outside of the viscous boundary layer at the side
wall. Here we address the issue of whether one can measure these temperatures through
the boundary layer. The response time of the thermistors for thermal diﬀusion through
the side wall is d2/κsw =
(1) s, where κsw is the thermal diﬀusivity of the plexiglas
wall. The response time for heat ﬂow through the viscous boundary layer – assumed to

real response time, since the data in this paper show that we could observe temperature
changes that occurred over time scales as short as several seconds. Consistent with direct
measurements of ﬂuctuations in the viscous boundary layer [Qiu & Xia (1998)], the
relatively fast thermal response time suggests that there is turbulent mixing in this
boundary layer that enhances the heat transport to the side-wall thermistors.

separately at each time step, to the eight middle-row side-wall thermistor-temperature
readings. An example of such a ﬁt is shown in Fig. 1a. Deviations from a smooth proﬁle
are presumed to be due to the turbulent nature of the system; for instance a hot plume
passing by a thermistor will cause a higher than average temperature reading at that
particular angular location. The ﬁt parameter δ is a measure of the amplitude of the LSC
and θ0 is the azimuthal orientation of the plane of the LSC circulation. As deﬁned here,
the orientation θ0 is on the side of the sample where the LSC is warm and up-ﬂowing
and is measured relative to the location of thermometer zero, which was located on the
east side of the sample. Typically the uncertainties for a single measurement were about
13% for δ and 0.02 rev. for θ0. Fitting to the cosine function does not yield a unique
θ0 because it is 2π periodic. The ﬁnal value of θ0 was chosen as the one closest to θ0 of
the previous timestep, thus allowing us to observe rotations of the LSC through larger
angles, than if we had reduced the range to 0 < θ0 < 2π. We calculated orientations
θt and θb and amplitudes δt and δb for the top and bottom rows by the same method
as for the middle row. Throughout the paper, when we show data based on one row of
thermistors it is for the middle row, while the top and bottom row measurements are
only used when data is shown for all three levels.

To test the validity of the sinusoidal ﬁtting function, Fig. 1b shows the side-wall
temperature-proﬁle normalized by the ﬁt values. Each point is an average of the nor-
θ0. The standard
malized termperature (Ti −
deviation of the normalized temperature for each bin is about 0.30 and nearly indepen-
dent of θ
θ0. It is shown as a vertical bar in the plot to indicate the typical size of
temperature ﬂuctuations. The data is in good agreement with a cosine function (solid

the average temperature proﬁle around the side wall relative to θ0.

The side-wall thermistors are also used to obtain the plume turnover time. Autocor-

relations of a single side-wall thermistor-temperature yielded peaks at times 0,
etc., while cross-correlation functions of mid-plane thermistors on opposite sides of the
sample were negative and yielded peaks at times

3. The nature of rotations and cessations

×

We previously published time series of θ0 and δ for the samples with 8 side-wall ther-
mistors [Brown et al. (2005b)]. Figure 2 shows a half-hour time series of θ0 and δ from
1010. The orientation
the medium sample with 24 side-wall thermistors at R = 1.1
and amplitudes are shown separately for the three rows of thermistors. The data contain
a series of erratic rotations of the orientation of the LSC. Through these rotations, a
reversal of the LSC direction (∆θ
1/2 rev.) is made over several hundred seconds,
roughly during the time interval from 500 to 1200s. This is a slow reversal relative to
, which is 49 seconds in this case. This type of reversal by
the plume turnover time
rotation has been reported before, using temperature measurements at various azimuthal
locations in the bottom plate of a convection cell to determine the LSC orientation [Cioni
et al.(1997)]. It is important to note that throughout these rotations, the temperature
amplitude δ remains non-zero. This implies that the LSC was circulating over this entire
period, so these are rotations and not cessations. The values for the three rows are seen
to agree fairly well, which agrees with our assumptions about the vertical alignment of
the LSC, but the top- and bottom-row temperatures generally have more variability than

the middle-row temperatures, and the amplitudes δt and δb drop on occasion without
signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the middle-row signal.

Figure 3 shows another time series of θ0 and δ for the three rows of thermistors. Here
δ decreased essentially to zero and then increased back up close to its average value.
We interpret an amplitude drop to also indicate a velocity drop, since the temperature
distribution – represented by δ – drives the LSC by buoyancy, and experiments have
found a correlation between temperature and velocity [Niemela et al. (2001), Qiu et al.
(2004)]. This means that the LSC gradually slowed to a stop, reversed direction, and
gradually sped up again in another direction without signiﬁcant rotation of the plane of
circulation. This is clearly a cessation, but note that it is not strictly a reversal because
∆θ < 1/2 rev.

4. Reorientation statistics

In this section we examine the statistics of reorientations, regardless of whether they
occur by rotation or cessation. However, these results reﬂect primarily the properties of
rotations because, as we shall show below in Figs. 7 and 14, cessations are an order of
magnitude more rare than rotations. We encountered a reorientation event roughly once
per hour (see Fig. 7 below). The statistics of cessations will be discussed separately in
Sect. 5.

4.1. Deﬁnition of reorientations
Because rotations do not necessarily have clear starting and ending points, and may
have a wide range of sizes and speeds, they are diﬃcult to deﬁne for the purpose of
data processing and statistical analysis. Instead, we start by deﬁning a reorientation as
an event with a suﬃciently large and quick change in the orientation of the LSC. More
speciﬁcally, we required reorientations to satisfy two criteria, using only data from the
middle row of thermistors since that was available from all of the experiments. These

criteria are the same as those used by Brown et al. (2005b). First, the magnitude of
the net angular change in orientation
over a set of successive data points for θ0
|
had to be greater than a chosen parameter ∆θmin. Second, the magnitude of the net
average azimuthal rotation rate
over that set had to be greater than a
∆θ/∆t
chosen parameter ˙θmin. Here ∆t is the duration of the reorientation. Usually multiple
overlapping sets satisﬁed these requirements, so in those cases the set with the maximum
/(∆t)n was chosen as the reorientation. For
local reorientation quality factor Qn =
|
0 < n < 1, Qn represents a compromise between choosing the maximum angular change
(Q0) or the maximum rotation rate (Q1). Any adjacent points to the chosen set were
also included if the instantaneous rotation rate ˙θ0 = δθ0/δt [δθ0 = θ0(t + δt)
θ0(t)] for
the adjacent point was greater than ˙θmin and of the same sign as for the reorientation.
For the results presented in this paper, we used the parameters ∆θmin = 0.125 rev.,
˙θmin = (0.1 rev. )/
, and n = 0.25; but since all three reorientation deﬁnition parameters
0.25 rev. ,
are arbitrary, we did the analysis over the ranges 1/64 rev.

not sensitive to the choice of reorientation deﬁnition parameters. For ∆θmin and ˙θmin, the
smallest values used were on the order of the turbulent ﬂuctuations in the data, so nearly
every data point would be counted as a reorientation, and at the largest parameter values
used too few events were counted to yield useful statistics. The qualitative conclusions
of the analysis did not change with the diﬀerent parameter values we tried. Some of the
quantitative values found from ﬁtting statistical distributions did change. Any variation
of these ﬁt values with the chosen parameters will be mentioned where it is appropriate.

the distribution was, within our resolution, independent of R. The power-law exponents
found could vary by up to a factor of 2 for extreme values of the reorientation deﬁni-
tion parameters. However, for all parameter values tried, the distribution was consistent
with a power law with a negative exponent that did not vary signiﬁcantly with R, and
there were never any peaks in the distribution. The major conclusions are that there is
a monotonically decreasing distribution of
, so that smaller reorientations are much

more common than larger ones, and that there is no characteristic reorientation size.
This analysis shows that the strict reversal is not especially common among reorien-
tation events. The probability distribution in Fig. 4 implies that only about 1% of the
reorientations we counted have
0.05 rev. This result is signiﬁcant because an
±
interpretation of previous experimental work had suggested that the events found were
all reversals [Niemela et al. (2001)], and two-dimensional theoretical models can predict
only reversals [Araujo et al. (2005), Benzi (2005)].

The probability distribution of the duration ∆t of reorientations, which is not shown

Since the method for deﬁning and counting reorientations is non-traditional, the anal-
ysis program was run on a simulated Brownian diﬀusive process for comparison. The
orientation θ0 was allowed to travel in one dimension in discrete steps at time intervals
equal to the sampling interval δt of experiments. The orientation change δθ0 for each
time step was randomly generated with the distribution of Gaussian white noise. The
simulated noise was made to have the same root-mean-square step size as the diﬀusive
1010 (given by ϕ√δt as deﬁned in Sect. 7). For this
region of the real data for R = 1.1
simulated data there are about half as many reorientations as in the real data. While
) looks similar in shape to that for the real data, it falls below the real data and

|
|
an exponential distribution ﬁts better than a power law to p(
). This suggests that
∆θ
|
|
the LSC undergoes signiﬁcantly more large reorientation events than a diﬀusive process.
One notable point is that there is a preferred orientation θm of the LSC, which is
apparent in the probability distribution of the mean wind orientation p(θ0) shown in
1010 (solid line). In this case, we reduced the orientation to the
Fig. 6 for R = 1.1
range 0 < θ0 < 2π. For other R, p(θ0) is generally found to have a single broad peak at a
θm that varies with R, but that is reproducible when experiments are done in the same
apparatus at the same R. This distribution would ideally be uniform in an azimuthally
symmetric system, but minor deviations from perfect rotational symetry such as a slight
tilt of the sample relative to gravity, a slightly elliptical cross section of the side wall, or
a coupling of the Earth’s Coriolis force to the LSC [Brown & Ahlers (2006)] could cause
a deviation from the uniform distribution. Also shown in the ﬁgure are the probability
distributions of the starting orientations p(θ0,i) (dotted line) and ending orientations
p(θ0,f ) (dashed line) of reorientations from the same data set. Both of these distributions
fall reasonably close to p(θ0). This shows that reorientations can occur at any orientation
θ0 of the mean wind. This conclusion diﬀers from that of Niemela et al. (2001), whose
interpretation of their data implied a bimodal distribution of the mean wind orientation,

with the orientation switching between two opposite orientations. This diﬀerence will be
discussed further in Sect. 6.

T

The average rate of occurrence ωr of reorientations is shown as a function of R in
Fig. 7, with error bars equal to the probable error of the mean. This rate did not vary
much with R for most of the range studied, but note that since ˙θmin = (0.1 rev. )/
(R) ,
the minimum requirement is more stringent at larger R, so a deﬁnition for reorientations
with ˙θmin independent of R would result in the frequency of events increasing with R.
The rate ωr depended strongly on the reorientation deﬁnition parameters: it decreased by
about 2.1% with each increase of 1% in ∆θmin, and it decreased by about 1.5% with each
increase of 1% in ˙θmin. When the new side wall with 24 thermistors with height L = 49.54
cm was used as part of the large apparatus, ωr increased by nearly a factor of 2. It was
also found that p(θ0) had a smaller peak and was closer to a uniform distribution (i.e.
p(θ + 0) = 1) with the newer side wall, but other measured parameters such as Reynolds
numbers did not change. The side walls were nominally identical, but the diameters had
local variations of about 5 parts in 10,000. It is likely that the ﬁrst side wall was less
circular, resulting in a pressure that tended to force the LSC orientation to align with
the long diameter of the side wall. This could explain why p(θ0) had a stronger peak at
the preferred orientation in the ﬁrst side wall, and would suggest that this forcing of the
LSC into a preferred orientation also suppreses reorientations. This suggests an incredible
sensitivity of reorientations to the geometry of the system, and it is unclear why it would
change the frequency of reorientations by such a large factor. This sensitivity does not

seem to qualitatively aﬀect other aspects of reorientations, such as p(

say that reorientations occur on the order of once per hour, it is diﬃcult to draw more
speciﬁc conclusions on this subject.

We now consider the distribution of reorientations in time. Let τn be the time intervals
between the ith and (i + n)th reorientations. For n = 1, τ1 is simply the time interval
between successive reorientations. This is similar to the deﬁnition used by Niemela et al.
(2001), whose studies of the time intervals between events referred to by them as reversals
of the LSC will be compared with the present work. However, their reversals were deﬁned
to occur at one instant, while in the present work reorientations are deﬁned to have some
duration. Thus we deﬁne τ1 as the time between, but not including the duration of,
reorientations. The results are essentially the same when the analysis is done with the
duration of reorientations included in τ1.

5. Cessation statistics

During the entire investigation, spanning about one year of data acquisition in each
of the two samples, we observed a total of nearly 1000 cessations. Of these 694 were for
untilted samples and at the Prandtl number σ = 4.38 under consideration in this paper.
In addition, 52 cessation events were encountered for σ = 4.38 in samples that were tilted
relative to gravity at various angles.

5.1. Deﬁnition of cessations

To better distinguish between the rotation and the cessation mechanism, we now consider
statistics for cessations only. In a previous paper [Brown et al. (2005b)] we identiﬁed ces-
sations as a subset of reorientations by determining whether the amplitude δ had dropped
below a speciﬁed value during the reorientation. We found that cessations accounted for
about 5% of reorientations. However, there also were events where the amplitude dropped
without a signiﬁcant change in orientation. These should be counted as cessations, but
were not counted as reorientations. Thus we now redeﬁne cessations and count them
whenever δ drops below a chosen minimum amplitude δl. All of the adjacent points in
the time series are counted as part of the cessation as long as δ is below a chosen max-
imum amplitude δh > δl. The lower-amplitude threshold δl was chosen as the largest
value such that p(
) was uniform. It was found to depend on the side wall used, but
∆θ

|
) was uniform. For all
∆θ
for each side wall it was chosen as the largest value such that p(
|
|
side walls this limiting distribution of uniform p(
) was reached for some small δl and
∆θ
|
|
p(
) remained uniform in the limit as δl was reduced to zero. For the medium sample,
∆θ
|
|
and for the large sample side wall with eight thermistors, we used the parameter value
.
δl = 0.15
i
The upper-amplitude threshold δh was chosen as the largest value such that ˙δ was equal
to its limiting value for small δ. For all samples this was δh = 0.5
. These properties of
i
cessations will be explained in more detail later in this section. Both parameters depend
at each R, which increases with R. Because our deﬁnition
on the average amplitude
of cessations depends on δ while reorientations depended on ∆θ and ˙θ, some events fall
into both categories, possibly with diﬀerent starting and ending times. Other events are
unique to either reorientations or cessations.

diﬀerent δl. For cessations we calculated ∆θ reduced to the range

adding or subtracting multiples of 2π, and then further reduced it to

of reorientations. This current plot additionally covers the range 0
which could not have been counted using the reorientation algorithm. This p(
) for
∆θ
|
|
cessations is very diﬀerent from the distribution for reorientations, which was found to
follow a power law with a large negative exponent. The uniform distribution of angular
changes implies that after the LSC stops, it is equally likely to start up again at any new
orientation, apparently losing its memory of its previous orientation. This interpretation
is the reason for using the reduced range
π < ∆θ < π, since there is no physical
−
diﬀerence between choices of ∆θ separated by 2π for cessations, in contrast to the case
for rotations where there is a continous variation in θ0. Again, reversals (i.e. ∆θ = 1/2
rev.) are not especially common.

Figure 11 shows the probability distributions p(θ0,i) (solid squares) and p(θ0,f ) (open
circles) of the orientations θ0,i and θ0,f at the beginning and at the end of cessations
for all data from the medium sample. The error bars represent the probable error of the
mean of each bin. The distribution p(θ0,i) at the beginning of cessations is peaked near
a preferred orientation θm, much like p(θ0) (see Fig. 6). This distribution is non-zero
for all θ0, so cessations can occur at any orientation. The distribution p(θ0,f ) at the
end of cessations is consistent with a uniform distribution, thus it is consistent with our
conclusion that the LSC restarts at a random orientation after a cessation. It is interesting
to note that whatever inhomogeneity causes the maximum in p(θ0) and p(θ0,i) does not
have any eﬀect on p(θ0,f ). This is consistent with the fact that cessations are relatively
quick events, happening in about a turnover time, while the non-uniform p(θ0) can be
attributed to the net eﬀect over a long period from a weak forcing [Brown & Ahlers
(2006)].

One interesting quantity is the duration of cessations ∆t. Figure 12 shows the proba-

To determine a more physically meaningful value relating to the duration of cessations,
the duration of each cessation was calculated for several values of the cessation cutoﬀ
parameter δh. Each cessation was also divided into two time intervals, one before and
one after the minimum amplitude was reached, so that the durations of the amplitude
decrease and the amplitude increase could be determined separately. Figure 13a shows
for both the amplitude decrease (solid

is generally held that the plume velocity is the same as that of the LSC. They deﬁned
reversals of the LSC as any switch between up-ﬂow and down-ﬂow of this local vertical
velocity component.

In a sequence of subsequent papers [Sreenivasan et al. (2002), Niemela & Sreeni-
vasan(2002), Niemela et al. (2002), Sreenivasan et al. (2004), Hwa et al.(2005)] some
of the members of the same research group carried out various statistical analyses of a
1011, i.e. close to the highest
particular data set taken at a Rayleigh number of 1.5
Rayleigh number achieved in the present work . For this time series the Prandtl num-
ber was 0.74 [Niemela & Sreenivasan(2003)], which diﬀers somewhat from our σ = 4.38.
Although the value of σ may have some inﬂuence for instance on the frequency of re-
versals, it seems unlikely that the diﬀerence in σ would qualitatively alter the physics

Niemela et al. (2001) report a turnover time of about 30 s for R = 1.5

should expect them to be a little shorter for Niemela et al. (2001).

The major diﬀerence between the results of their work and of ours is the distribution
) for the time intervals τ1 between successive events. Sreenivasan et al. (2002)
of p(τ1/
i
found that a power law ﬁt the distribution p(τ1/
) for small τ1 and an exponential
i
function ﬁt the tail, while we found an exponential function to ﬁt the distribution over
the entire range for both reorientations and cessations (see Figs. 8 and 15). In a related
matter there is a large diﬀerence between the frequency of events determined in the
two experiments: Sreenivasan et al. (2002) reported about 420 events per day while
we ﬁnd only about 50 reorientations per day – an order of magnitude less. If their
reversals correspond to cessations, then the diﬀerence is 2 orders of magnitude; or if the
correspondence is to reorientations, for instance with ∆θ = 1/2
0.05 rev., then the
diﬀerence is 3 orders of magnitude.

These diﬀerences can be understood by reinterpreting some results. Niemela et al.
(2001) reported a nearly bimodal velocity distribution, which led them to the then rea-
sonable belief that the large-scale circulation-plane had a more or less ﬁxed azimuthal
orientation relative to their sensors, and that the LSC was switching between two oppos-
ing directions in that plane. Our experiments with eight side-wall thermistors provided
new information in the azimuthal dimension, showing that the LSC in our system sam-
ples all azimuthal orientations, and that reorientations and cessations can occur at any
orientation. While it is possible that an asymmetry of the apparatus used by Niemela
et al. (2001) could have resulted in two opposing preferred orientations, it seems unlikely

that this could also account for the much greater frequency of events observed by them,
especially since our experiments with an asymmetry introduced by tilting the samples
(see Sect. 8) show a strongly reduced frequency for both reorientations and cessations,
but otherwise no qualitative diﬀerence.

Here we present an alternative explanation for the results of Niemela et al. (2001).
We consider the velocity in the plume layer, a thin region between the bulk and bound-
ary layer near the side wall. We hypothesize that this velocity, when averaged over an
), has a vertical component that is nearly a
intermediate time interval (say of order
step function of θ, with speed +v when θ is within
v for all other
angles. To be clear, this time average should be over a period long enough to identify the
LSC, but short enough to not contain any reorientations. The one-turnover-time average
used in the experiment of Niemela et al. (2001) satisﬁes these criteria. A justiﬁcation for
this step-function velocity-distribution, independent of its ability to explain the results of
Niemela et al. (2001), is given in the Appendix. As a consequence of random azimuthal
meandering of the LSC this distribution would produce the bimodal velocity distribution
reported by Niemela et al. (2001). It also leads to an alternative interpretation of the
events they counted: if reversals are counted whenever the local velocity switches direc-
tions at a sensor as seen by Niemela et al. (2001), then this is equivalent to counting
events whenever the LSC orientation crosses a critical angle orthogonal to the azimuthal
sensor orientation so that the interface between the up- and down-ﬂow moves past the
sensors. These events usually are not reversals with ∆θ = 1/2 rev., as they would include
events covering a continuum of ∆θ. Indeed for many of the events the LSC orientation
would change only slightly, but just enough to cross the critical angle. We can test this
hypothesis by reanalyzing our own data to study this new type of event which we shall
call a crossing. In our system we shall count it whenever the LSC orientation θ0(t) crosses
π/2 rad. This
either of the two angles orthogonal to the preferred orientation, i. e. θm ±
choice of the crossing angles is arbitrary as long as they are separated by π, and if we use
for instance θm and θm + π rad then our statistical results are qualitatively unchanged.
If our hypothesis about the velocity distribution is correct, then the analysis of crossings
from our data should yield the same statistical results as the events reported by Niemela
et al. (2001) and Sreenivasan et al. (2002).

s or about 172 crossings per day. This is only a factor of 2.4 smaller than the frequency
of events reported by Sreenivasan et al. (2002), and thus plausibly consistent, especially
since their experiment has a somewhat shorter turnover time.

with the results of Sreenivasan et al. (2002), which implies that the two experiments are
consistent, but that crossings rather than rotations or cessations are comparable to the
events reported in the earlier work.

To understand why the power-law distributions occur, we again reanalyze the present
data with a modiﬁed deﬁnition for crossings. It was suggested by Sreenivasan et al.
(2002) that the LSC orientation undergoes some “azimuthal drift (or jitter)”. We want to
eliminate the counting of events in which the orientation jitters back and forth around the
crossing angles, and only count events where there is a signiﬁcant change in orientation
of the LSC. To this avail we deﬁne buﬀered crossings as occurring when θ0(t) not only
π/2 rad, but also exits a buﬀer region of width π/4 rad centered about either
crosses θm ±

with the data (dashed line), showing that these buﬀered crossings are Poissonian. A
power law p(τ1)
is also shown (solid line) for comparison. Now it is apparent that
jitter, or small orientation changes of the LSC around the crossing angles, was responsible
for the power-law distribution of p(τ1) for small τ1. There are only 520 buﬀered crossings
from the same data set that had 2032 crossings, so the jitter is of course also the reason
for the large number of events.

crossings in the spirit of Niemela et al. (2001) and Sreenivasan et al. (2002). One aspect
of that analysis was the fractal dimension of the time series of events. We took a time
series with reorientations, divided up the time axis into bins of width r, and then placed
each reorientation into the appropriate bin based on the time when the event occurred.
We then counted the number of non-empty bins Nr. The fractal dimension D is deﬁned
by the equation Nr = r−D in the limit of small r. Figure 19 shows Nr for various bin
1010
widths r for reorientations at all R (solid circles) and for crossings at R = 1.1
r−1, which is the case where
(open circles). For r
, the data always follows Nr ∝
i
the bin width is so large that every bin contains at least one reorientation. This is called
the space-ﬁlling limit. For r
, Nr reaches a constant (D = 0) for reorientations.
i
This is the limit where the bin widths are so small that every reorientation falls into
its own bin. Also shown in Fig. 19 is the analytical result for a Poissonian distribution:
Nr = (N0
)], where N0 is the total number of events. The
i
theory agrees perfectly with our data for reorientations, so it provides further evidence
that reorientations are Poissonian. However, the data for crossings can be ﬁtted by a
, and yield D = 0.21. This is reasonably consistent
power law Nr ∝
i
with the results of Niemela et al. (2001), which gave a range of values 0.2
0.5
for diﬀerent R. The non-zero value of D is characteristic of the power-law distribution of
time intervals; no matter how small r is, there are a ﬁnite number of time intervals that
are smaller than r, so Nr will not reach the total number of events.

When we calculate the fractal dimension for buﬀered crossings we get D = 0. D is
indistinguishable from zero for buﬀer widths greater than 3π/16 rad., while D gradually
increases for smaller buﬀer widths up to D = 0.21 for no buﬀer. This suggests that once
the orientation is 3π/32 rad. from the crossing angle it is far enough away that the jitter
of θ0 no longer aﬀects the event statistics.

explanation will not work for us because we found p(τ1) to agree with an exponential
distribution over the entire range of τ1. Inspection of p(τ1) in Fig. 8 shows more large
time intervals than would be expected for a Poisson distribution, although only by a few
events. This might account for the large higher-order moments that we found, and thus
for the oﬀending values of ζ. The question remains as to whether reorientations are a
Poissonian process and we recorded a lot of large time intervals by chance, or whether it
indicates non-Poissonian physics at large time intervals. There are very few data points
with these large time intervals, so we can not distinguish between these two possibilities.
Again, to better compare to the results of Sreenivasan et al. (2002), we calculated the
moments for crossings (not shown) and ζ(q) as before. Figure 23 shows the exponents

attributed to an underlying log-normal distribution.

the reversals of Sreenivasan et al. (2002).

In this section we showed that we can reproduce the major statistical results of Niemela
et al. (2001) and Sreenivasan et al. (2002), but only when we consider crossings. The
results from our experiment diﬀer from those of the earlier work when we consider only
events corresponding to our deﬁnition of reorientations or cessations. The events reported
by Niemela et al. (2001) were assumed by them to be reversals of the LSC because the
local ﬂow velocity reversed directions. Our results, based on the angular information
about the LSC orientation aﬀorded by the use of eight side-wall thermistors, have shown
that they were likely counting crossings in which the orientation of the LSC crossed a
ﬁxed line, which often counts small jitters of the LSC orientation as events. Since we
are interested in events that involve larger changes of the ﬂow ﬁeld, we have focused on
studying reorientations consisting of rotations and cessations.

It is interesting to consider why reorientations are suppressed by tilting the sample. If
tilting simply added a slight deterministic rotation rate due to the added buoyancy of
the boundary layers, then we would expect it to suppress reorientations with
smaller
than the deterministic term. We can use a highly simpliﬁed model to estimate the order
of magnitude of this eﬀect. This model is based on one used successfully to estimate
the eﬀect of tilting on the Reynolds number [Chill`a et al.(2004b), Ahlers et al. (2005)].
Tilting the sample by a small angle β relative to gravity results in a buoyancy force per
unit area in the thermal boundary layers approximately given by ρlgβα∆T /2 parallel to
the plates, where l is the boundary-layer thickness. This forcing mainly contributes to
enhancing the LSC since it is usually aligned with the slope of the plates [Ahlers et al.
(2005)], but when the LSC is not aligned with this slope, some fraction of this forcing will
push the LSC into an azimuthal rotation towards the orientation θβ. We would expect
θ0). This buoyant forcing is opposed by the
this fraction to be proportional to sin(θβ −

values into Eq. 8.1 we obtain ˙θ0 = 0.40β sin(θβ −
of θ0 we implicitly assumed that inertia is negligible, i.e. ¨θ0 = 0. This model also ignores
possible buoyant forcing in the bulk due to the non-uniform temperature distribution
there, and additional viscous stress in the viscous boundary layers as opposed to just
the thermal boundary layers which were chosen for the convenience of balancing stresses,
as well as any deformation of the LSC due to uneven distribution of these forces. This
model is meant to predict a shape for the distribution of ˙θ0(θ0) due to buoyant forces, as
well as the order of magnitude of the eﬀect. Neither of these predictions are expected to
change signiﬁcantly by accounting for the aforementioned imperfections of the model.

We can ﬁnd the magnitude of this eﬀect experimentally by averaging the instantaneous
rotation rate ˙θ0 at diﬀerent orientations θ0. Even though the turbulent meanderings of
the LSC orientation tend to be much larger than the deterministic part, by averaging over
many data points at the same value of θ0 we are able to resolve the deterministic eﬀects.

proportional to sin(θβ −
is not accurate. If we were to include both the inertial term and a driving term due to
turbulence in the above model, then the equation would be equivalent to that of a damped
driven pendulum, although we do not know how to represent the driving term. To better
compare the data to the model, we calculated ˙θ0(θ0, τ ) = [θ0(τ + δt/2)
δt/2)]/δt
(where τ represents a shift of the time axis), and binned the data based on θ0(τ = 0) =
[θ0(δt/2) + θ0(
δt/2)]/2. This yielded a rotation rate as a function of the delay time
τ after θ0 had been reached. The above model neglects inertia, so we chose the delay
time τ = τmax such that ˙θ0(θ0, τmax) is maximized to satisfy ¨θ0(τmax) = 0. Typically

Finally we consider what eﬀect the β-dependence of the deterministic rotation rate has
on reorientations. The minimum rotation rate for counting reorientations for these data
is ˙θmin = 0.0254 rad/s, which is much larger than the deterministic forcing A = 0.0047
rad/s found for β =
0.013, and it is even larger than the largest measured value for
the deterministic forcing A = 0.015 rad/s. Thus we conclude that the direct forcing
from tilting the sample that is considered in the above model is too small to account

9. Comparison with contemporary experiments

In a set of contemporary experiments, Xi et al. (2006) report measurements of the
5, and 109 < R < 1010.
orientation of the LSC for a RBC sample with Γ = 1, σ
To study short-term dynamics, they used particle image velocimetry to visualize the
horizontal ﬂuid velocities near the top plate. From these measurements they calculated
a spatially-averaged velocity and orientation for the LSC. For long-term measurements,
they used a bead attached to a “ﬁshing line” near the bottom plate to determine the
orientation of the LSC.

≈

Many of the results reported by Xi et al. (2006) are similar to ours and provide an
excellent complement to our measurements, as they use velocity measurements and we use
temperature measurements to quantify aspects of the LSC. Some of the results deserve
special comment in relation to our work.

Xi et al. (2006) report an oscillation of the LSC orientation around a preferred orienta-
tion that they measured near the top and bottom plates. This oscillation was measured
before by Funfschilling & Ahlers (2004) on the basis of plume motion across the top and
bottom plates. We ﬁnd it as well, but only in the upper and lower rows of thermistors at
heights 3L/4 and L/4. As seen by Funfschilling & Ahlers (2004), the oscillations in the
top and bottom rows are out of phase with each other. This can be seen to some extent
in Fig. 2 (we will report on it in detail elsewhere [Brown et al. (2006)]). We note that
other aspects of the LSC azimuthal dynamics can depend quantitatively on the height
at which they are measured, but so far this is the only process known to have such a
qualitative height dependence.

Xi et al. (2006) report that the LSC orientation remains locked near a preferred angle
for the duration of an experimental run for a large majority of such runs. Curiously, this
preferred orientation changes with each experimental run in a non-reproducible manner
and thus cannot be due entirely to some geometrical asymmetry of their apparatus. It
suggests a more complicated symmetry-breaking process. For comparison to our experi-

upper plot is for β = 0 and the lower one is for β =
0.0044 rad. Consistent with the re-
sults shown in Fig. 6, the β = 0 data show a weak preference for some angle, presumably
due to asymmetries such as the Coriolis force or very slight deformations of the side walls
[Brown & Ahlers (2006)]; but the preferred orientation is not nearly as severe as the one
observed by Xi et al. (2006). The plot for β =
0.0044 rad looks qualitatively similar to

the time series reported by Xi et al. (2006), although the frequency of rotations through
an entire revolution is much lower and p(θ0) is still wider in our case. Since in our case the
asymmetry is due to tilting the sample, we should not expect these statistical quantities
to correspond exactly to those of Xi et al. (2006).

Considering the diﬀerences between the two experiments, the cause for this preferred
orientation may be the sapphire top plate in their experiment, with about 1/10 the con-
ductivity of our copper plates. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Boussinesq
equations by Verzicco (2004) and experiments by Brown et al. (2005a) show that low-
conductivity top and/or bottom plates reduce the heat transport across the sample. The
DNS suggest that the low plate conductivity reduces the plume emission from the plates.
Following Verzicco, we suggest that it is possible that the LSC put a signiﬁcant thermal
imprint on the sapphire plate. This thermal imprint would diﬀuse more quickly in a
copper plate due to its higher conductivity. The thermal imprint in the sapphire plate
presumably discourages cold plume emission, thus introducing a preferred orientation of
the circulation corresponding to the initial orientation chosen by the LSC. If the thermal
imprint remains longer than the duration of cessations and full azimuthal revolutions of
the LSC, then the preferred orientation can remain so for the duration of the experi-
mental run. This would also explain why the preferred orientation changes between runs,
assuming the ﬂow is stopped for some signiﬁcant length of time between them.

To test this model, we examined data taken with aluminum top and bottom plates
[Brown et al. (2005a)] in place of the usual copper ones. Aluminum has a thermal con-
ductivity about 1/2 that of copper, which is still a factor of about four or ﬁve larger
than that of sapphire, but since the aluminum plates slightly suppressed the overall heat
transport relative to the copper-plate system, we hoped to see some inﬂuence also on the
LSC orientation. In this case, the eight side-wall thermistors were glued to the outside
of the side wall at a height L/2, so they were 0.31 cm away from the ﬂuid. The thermal
response time through the side wall is expected to be d2/κsw =
(10) s. The locking
of the orientation is compared in Fig. 33 by p(θ0) for copper plates (open circles) and
aluminum plates (solid circles). The distribution is more strongly peaked with aluminum
plates and does not sample all angles as well as with copper plates , indicating that the
orientation tends to be more strongly locked in place with aluminum plates. This sup-
ports our model about the thermal imprint suppressing orientation changes of the LSC,

O

but a pair of experiments comparing copper and sapphire plates with a much larger ratio
of conductivities would be more convincing.

Xi et al. (2006) report ﬁnding a double-cessation event, in which there are two succes-
sive cessations, and the second cessation returns the LSC to its original orientation. While
we have not identiﬁed these events in our system, they are not necessarily inconsistent
with our measurements. Since we count a cessation as occurring for the duration that
the amplitude δ remains below some threshold δh, if a double cessation occurred in our
system, we would most likely count it as a single cessation. Our measurements of δ have
a relative error of about 12% when δ is near its average value, making it diﬃcult for us
to resolve double cessations. However, it is also quite possible that the double cessations
are uniquely due to the suppression of plumes due to the thermal imprint on the sapphire
plate, which could explain why the LSC is forced back into its original orientation.

±

The average frequency of cessations (also counting double cessations) for the data
reported by Xi et al. (2006) is ωc = 1.7 day−1 with a probable error of the mean of 0.3
day−1. This is consistent with our value of 1.5
0.1 day−1. Considering the diﬀerent
types and locations of the measurements of the two experiments, and the sensitivity
of cessation frequency to minor asymmetries as well as to how they are counted, it is
somewhat fortuitous that the frequency of events in both experiments is in such good
agreement. Xi et al. (2006) report an increasing frequency of cessations with increasing R,
in contrast to our uniform frequency of cessations. This could be due to the criteria used
for deﬁning cessations: we used a minimum amplitude δl that changes with R, while Xi
et al. (2006) use the velocity time series to ﬁnd cessations. While we expect the velocity
and temperature amplitudes to have similar behavior, we do not know if they should
behave exactly the same during cessations, and thus we do not know if our methods of
counting cessations are fully equivalent.

The results from the analysis of crossings by Xi et al. (2006) (they referred to the
events as “reversals”) are qualitatively similar to ours. In particular, the shape of the
probability distribution of the time intervals τ1 between crossings has the same shape
(see our Fig. 17). Notably, the time interval at the crossover between the power-law de-
in both cases. The characteristic
pendence and the exponential dependence is about 10
decay time of the exponential region was signiﬁcantly larger for Xi et al. (2006) (54
)
than for us (32
). However, since this represents a typical long time interval between
crossings, and the azimuthal motion was suppressed in their case, this diﬀerence is not
surprising.

10. Summary and conclusions

We presented a broad range of measurements of the orientation of the LSC, includ-
ing rotations and cessations. These events have not been well-studied experimentally or
theoretically in the past, and we have very little physical understanding of how these
phenomena occur. One important conclusion we can make is that when the LSC slows to
a stop during a cessation, it loses information of its previous orientations and restarts at
a random new orientation. We also found that both cessations and reorientations have a
Poisson distribution in time, indicating the independence of successive events. We mea-
sured the rate of change of the amplitude ˙δ during cessations. Its value can be compared
with future dynamical theories of cessations.

Sreenivasan et al. (2002) found that the time interval τ1 between their successive
events had a power-law probability-distribution with an exponent of minus one when τ1
was small, and was cut oﬀ exponentially at larger τ1. They, and in more detail Sreeni-
vasan et al. (2004), interpreted the power law as indicative of self-organized criticality

Rotations and cessations of the large-scale circulation in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection33

(SOC) and attributed the exponential cut-oﬀ to a ﬁnite-size eﬀect. In another paper Hwa
et al.(2005) proposed an analogy between the statistics of wind reversals on the one hand
and that of ﬂuctuations of the magnetization of the two-dimensional Ising model on the
other. Again this analogy rested heavily upon the existence of a power-law probability-
distribution for τ1. Our results for the statistics of the rotations and cessations that make
up our reorientations are inconsistent with this interpretation and reveal a purely Pois-
sonian probability distribution for our data which goes to a constant at small τ1 and
drops oﬀ exponentially at large τ1; but when we include the relatively small-amplitude
and high-frequency jitter of θ0(t) in the analysis by considering “crossings”, then we
reproduce the statistics observed by Sreenivasan et al. (2002). Thus we conclude that
the SOC and the Ising-model analogy discussed by them and by Hwa et al.(2005) can
perhaps apply to the jitter of our measurements of θ0(t) but does not pertain to the
reorientations (i.e. rotations and cessations) observed by us. We also have no reason to
invoke a ﬁnite-size eﬀect to explain a large-τ1 cutoﬀ because the Poissonian statistics of
our reorientations naturally yields exponential behavior at large τ1.

Both reorientations and cessations are found to be strongly suppressed in a tilted
sample. The measurements could not be accounted for simply by the buoyancy of the
boundary layer creating a preferred orientation of the LSC. This leaves an open problem
for future work to answer. In addition it is unknown whether this reduction in the fre-
quency of events applies to other types of asymmetries, such as a strong Coriolis force or
more complicated geometries that are common in geophysical systems.

We presented data showing a statistical relationship between the rotation rate

and the amplitude δ of the LSC. This is interesting because of a phenomenon found in
nature: reversals in the orientation of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld presumably as a result of
convection reversal in the outer core are also known to be accompanied by a decrease in
the amplitude of the resulting magnetic ﬁeld [Glatzmaier et al. (1999)]. Previously Brown

et al. (2005b) reported a correlation function of δ and

by about 6% of the turnover time. If this is extrapolated to the 400 year turnover time
of the Earth’s outer core, measurements of the Earth’s magnetic-ﬁeld amplitude could
give several years’ notice of a magnetic-ﬁeld reversal. Convection in the Earth’s core is in
many ways diﬀerent from our ideal convection experiment, so this extrapolation is highly
speculative; but it is a subject worthy of future study if it could lead to a forecasting of
events which would have a signiﬁcant impact on human life.

12. Appendix: The velocity and temperature distributions in the

plume layer

The bimodal vertical velocity distribution near the side wall reported by Niemela
et al. (2001) led them to suggest that the LSC orientation switched between two opposite
directions aligned with their sensors. We suggest that a bimodal local velocity distribution
does not imply a bimodal probability distribution p(θ0), and that the orientation could
have been varying erratically through any azimuthal angle in their experiment.

109 provide some useful information [Sun et al. (2005)]. For the vertical velocity
R = 7.0
near the side wall in the plane aligned with the preferred orientation of the LSC (caused
by a slight tilt), no reversals of the velocity direction were found. This agrees with our
results for a tilted sample discussed in Sect. 8. In the plane orthogonal to this, many
random velocity reversals were found, and they happened at the same time on opposite
sides of the sample, so that there was always one side with up-ﬂow and one side with
down-ﬂow Further, the magnitude of the velocity averaged over short time intervals (10
min, without reversals) was about the same in both planes. This orthogonal-plane result
is qualitatively similar to that of Niemela et al. (2001), although the latter did not have
a tilted sample and did not know the preferred orientation of the LSC in their system.
Since Sun et al. (2005) found no velocity reversals in the plane of the LSC, it follows that
the observed reversals in the orthogonal plane were not likely to be global reversals of the
LSC. Since the magnitude of the velocity was about the same in both planes, this suggest
that the vertical velocity distribution near the side wall was nearly a step function with
v at all other angles, although realistically
velocity +v at angles within
the velocity must smoothy transition from +v to
v over some small angular range. Since
Niemela et al. (2001) only observed local velocity reversals, these could have mostly been
small orientation changes in which the +/
v interface moved past the sensors. If the
−
sample of Niemela et al. (2001) was suﬃciently symmetric, it is still likely that some of
the measured events were rotations or cessations.

The question remains whether this step-function velocity-distribution can be reconciled
with our measurement of the shape of the temperature distribution around the side wall,
θ0) (see Fig. 1). Here
which we found to be given by T (θ) = T0 + δT with δT = δ cos(θ
we present a model of the thin shell between the boundary layer and the bulk, also called
the plume layer. We assume that the average ﬂow in this shell is parallel to the nearest
wall of the container, and that the streamlines make complete loops and are parallel to
the plane of the LSC as drawn in Fig. 34. This time average should be thought of as
along enough to identify the LSC but short compared to the time between reorientations.
Our calculation is based on the steady-state heat-transport equation

We found a horizontal temperature diﬀerence of the form δT (θ) = δ cos(θ
θ0), which on
the basis of our model implies that u(θ) has a uniform magnitude but opposite direction
near the top and bottom boundary layers. Assuming that viscous drag and other mech-
anisms do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the plume-layer velocity, following the streamlines in
Fig.34a implies that the vertical velocities along the side wall must have the same mag-
nitude, resulting in the previously mentioned step-function velocity-distribution. This
model ignores many aspects of the LSC, and thus cannot be a complete description of
it. The model is meant to provide an understanding of why our measured temperature
distribution around the side wall has a diﬀerent shape than the velocity distribution
suggested by the data of Sun et al. (2005). Additionally it justiﬁes our suggestion of the
step-function velocity-distribution in discussing the data of Niemela et al. (2001). With-
out the qualitative features of the model described here it might be diﬃcult to reconcile
the results of the three experiments.

Coherent large-scale circulations of turbulent thermal convection in air have been studied ex-
perimentally in a rectangular box heated from below and cooled from above using Particle Image
Velocimetry. The hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection was found by varying the temper-
ature diﬀerence between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber (the Rayleigh number was
changed within the range of 107 − 108). The hysteresis loop comprises the one-cell and two-cells
ﬂow patterns while the aspect ratio is kept constant (A = 2 − 2.23). We found that the change of
the sign of the degree of the anisotropy of turbulence was accompanied by the change of the ﬂow
pattern. The developed theory of coherent structures in turbulent convection (Elperin et al. 2002;
2005) is in agreement with the experimental observations. The observed coherent structures are
superimposed on a small-scale turbulent convection. The redistribution of the turbulent heat ﬂux
plays a crucial role in the formation of coherent large-scale circulations in turbulent convection.

INTRODUCTION

Coherent structures in turbulent convection are ob-
served in the atmospheric convective boundary layers
(see, e.g., Etling and Brown 1993; Atkinson and Wu
Zhang 1996; Br¨ummer 1999) and in laboratory exper-
iments (see, e.g., Krishnamurti and Howard 1981; Sig-
gia 1994; Kadanoﬀ 2001). In the atmospheric shear-free
convection, the coherent structures represent large-scale
three-dimensional
long-lived B´enard-type cells (cloud
cells) composed of narrow uprising plumes and wide
downdraughts. They usually embrace the entire convec-
tive boundary layer (of the order of 1-3 km in height)
and include pronounced convergence ﬂow patterns close
to the surface. In the sheared convective ﬂows, the coher-
ent structures represent convective boundary layer scale
rolls (cloud streets) stretched along the mean wind (see,
e.g., Etling and Brown 1993; Atkinson and Wu Zhang
1996; Br¨ummer 1999).

Buoyancy-driven structures, such as plumes, jets, and
large-scale circulation patterns were observed in numer-
ous laboratory experiments. The large-scale circulation
caused by convection in the Rayleigh-B´enard apparatus
is often called the ”mean wind” (see, e.g., Krishnamurti
and Howard 1981; Zocchi et al. 1990; Ciliberto et al.
1996; Niemela et al.
2002;
Niemela and Sreenivasan 2003; Burr et al. 2003; Shang
et al. 2004; Xi et al. 2004; Tsuji et al. 2005; Brown et
al. 2005, and references therein). There are several open
questions concerning these ﬂows, e.g., how do they arise,
and what are their characteristics and dynamics.

2001; Sreenivasan et al.

The life-times of coherent structures are very long com-
pared to the largest turbulent time-scales. Their spec-
tral properties diﬀer from those of small-scale turbulence.
They are characterized by narrow spectra and do not ex-
hibit the direct energy-cascade behavior (from larger to

smaller scales). As a result the turbulence and the co-
herent structures interact in practically the same way as
the turbulence and the mean ﬂow. These structures show
more similarity in their behavior with regular ﬂows than
with turbulence. They can be identiﬁed as the motions,
whose spatial and temporal scales are much larger than
the characteristic turbulent scales.

In spite of a number of theoretical and numerical stud-
ies (see, e.g., Busse and Whitehead 1971; 1974; Busse
1983; Lenschow and Stephens 1980; Hunt 1984; Hunt
et al. 1988; Schmidt and Schumann 1989; Zilitinkevich
1991; Williams and Hacker 1992; 1993; Zilitinkevich et
al. 1998; Young et al. 2002; Parodi et al. 2004, and ref-
erences therein), the nature of large-scale coherent struc-
tures in turbulent convection is a subject of discussions.
Hartlep et al.
(2003) noted that there are two points
of view on the origin of large-scale circulation in turbu-
lent convection. ”According to one point of view, the
rolls which develop at low Rayleigh numbers, Ra, near
the onset of convection continually increase their size as
Ra is increased and continue to exist in an average sense
at even the highest Rayleigh numbers reached in the ex-
periments (see, e.g., Fitzjarrald 1976). Another hypoth-
esis holds that the large-scale circulation is a genuine
high Rayleigh number eﬀect (see, e.g., Krishnamurti and
Howard 1981).”

The new mechanism of formation of the large-scale co-
herent structures in turbulent convection was proposed
recently by Elperin et al. (2002; 2005). It was suggested
that the redistribution of the turbulent heat ﬂux plays
a crucial role in the formation of the large-scale circu-
lations in turbulent convection. In particular, two com-
petitive eﬀects, namely redistribution of the vertical tur-
bulent heat ﬂux due to convergence or divergence of the
horizontal mean ﬂows, and production of the horizontal
component of the turbulent heat ﬂux due to the interac-
tion of the mean vorticity with the vertical component of
the turbulent heat ﬂux, cause the large-scale instability
and formation of the large-scale coherent structures in
turbulent convection (Elperin et al. 2002; 2005).

The main goal of this paper is to describe the experi-
mental study of large-scale circulations of turbulent ther-
mal convection in air ﬂow (the aspect ratios A = 2−2.23).
In order to study large-scale circulations we used Parti-
cle Image Velocimetry to determine the turbulent and
mean velocity ﬁelds, and a specially designed tempera-
ture probe with twelve sensitive thermocouples was em-
ployed to measure the temperature ﬁeld. We found the
hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection by vary-
ing the temperature diﬀerence between the bottom and
the top walls of the chamber (the Rayleigh number was
changed within the range of Ra = 107 − 108). The hys-
teresis loop comprises the one-cell and two-cell ﬂow pat-
terns. We found that the change of the sign of the de-
gree of the anisotropy of turbulence was accompanied by
the change of the pattern of the mean wind. The devel-
oped theory of coherent structures in turbulent convec-
tion (Elperin et al. 2002; 2005) is in a good agreement
with the experimental observations.

The hysteresis phenomenon in laminar convection was
found by Busse (1967) who deﬁned it as follows: ”The
fact that the convection at a certain Rayleigh number
depends on the way in which the Rayleigh number has
been reached is called the hysteresis eﬀect in laminar con-

structures transform into rolls structures by increasing
the Rayleigh number. On the other hand, decreasing
the Rayleigh number causes the transition from the rolls
structure to the hexagons. Similar phenomena were ob-
served in numerical simulations and laboratory experi-
ments (see, e.g., Busse 1978; Braunsfurth et al. 1996;
Gelfgat et al. 1999, and references therein).

In the experiments by Willis et al. (1972) performed
in air, water and a silicon oil for the Rayleigh numbers
Ra = (0.2 − 3) × 104 and large aspect ratios (for air
A = 31.5), it was demonstrated that the average dimen-
sionless roll diameter, Λ, increases as Ra is increased.
This observation was less pronounced for large Rayleigh
number ﬂows (for water and silicon oil). The hysteresis
phenomenon was found in dependence Λ(Ra) for large
Prandtl number ﬂows (for water and silicon oil), but this
phenomenon was not observed in the air ﬂow (Willis et
al. 1972). For considerably larger values of the Rayleigh
numbers the convection patterns become very compli-
cated (Willis et al. 1972) and turbulent convection arises.
In the experiments by Fitzjarrald (1976) in air ﬂow it
was shown that in convection with large aspect ratios
the predominant horizontal scale of the regular struc-
tures increased from 4h at Ra = 105 to 6h at Ra = 106
(where h is the vertical distance between plates). In the
range Ra = 106 − 107 this scale did not change (Fitzjar-
rald 1976). Notably, the hysteresis phenomenon was not
observed by Fitzjarrald (1976).

In the direct numerical simulations of convection by
(2003) for the Rayleigh numbers Ra =
Hartlep et al.
103 − 106, the Prandtl number Pr = 0.7 and large as-
pect ratio (A = 10) it was found that ”the typical size
of the large-scale structures does not always vary mono-

2

tonically as a function of Ra, but broadly increases with
increasing Ra. It cannot be decided from these simula-
tions whether the large-scale structures will eventually
disappear at yet higher Rayleigh numbers.” Notably, the
hysteresis phenomenon was not observed by Hartlep et
al. (2003).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses
the physics of formation of the large-scale coherent struc-
tures, and Section 3 describes the experimental set-up for
a laboratory study of this eﬀect. The experimental re-
sults and their detailed analysis are presented in Section
4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

II. TURBULENT HEAT FLUX AND
COHERENT STRUCTURES

Traditional theoretical models of the boundary-layer
turbulence, such as the Kolmogorov-type local closures,
imply the following assumptions. Fluid ﬂows are decom-
posed into two components of principally diﬀerent na-
ture, organized mean ﬂow and turbulent ﬂow. Turbu-
lent ﬂuxes are proportional to the local mean gradients,
whereas the proportionality coeﬃcients (eddy viscosity,
turbulent diﬀusivity) are uniquely determined by local
turbulent parameters. For example, a widely used tra-
ditional approximation for the turbulent heat ﬂux reads
F = hsui = −κT ∇S (see, e.g., Monin & Yaglom 1975),
where κT is the turbulent thermal conductivity, S is the
mean entropy, u and s are ﬂuctuations of the velocity
and entropy, respectively.

The traditional form for the turbulent heat ﬂux F does
not include the contribution from anisotropic velocity
ﬂuctuations. Actually the mean velocity gradients can
directly aﬀect the turbulent heat ﬂux. The reason is that
additional essentially anisotropic velocity ﬂuctuations are
generated by tangling the mean-velocity gradients with
the Kolmogorov-type turbulence due to the inﬂuence of
the inertial forces during the life time of large turbulent
eddies. Therefore, the Kolmogorov turbulence supplies
energy to the anisotropic (tangling) turbulence.
In its
turn the anisotropic turbulence causes formation of co-
herent structures due to the excitation of a large-scale
instability (Elperin et al. 2002; 2005). Anisotropic veloc-
ity ﬂuctuations were studied for the ﬁrst time by Lumley
(1967). He had shown that the velocity ﬁeld in the pres-
ence of mean shear is strongly anisotropic and is charac-
terized by a steeper spectrum than the Kolmogorov tur-
bulence (see also Wyngaard and Cote 1972; Saddoughi
et al. 1994; Ishihara et al. 2002; Yoshida et al. 2003,
among others).

In order to parameterize the anisotropic turbulence, a
spectral closure model was developed by Elperin et al.
(2002; 2005). The derivation of the anisotropic turbu-
lence model includes the following steps: applying the
spectral closure, solving the equations for the second
moments in the k space, and returning to the physical
space to obtain formulas for the Reynolds stresses and

the turbulent heat ﬂux. The derivation are based on the
Navier-Stokes equation and the entropy evolution equa-
tion formulated in the Boussinesq approximation. This
derivation yields the following expression for the turbu-
lent ﬂux of entropy F ≡ hsui:

is a generalized anisotropic turbulent heat conductivity

unit vector. The equation for the tensor κij was derived
in Appendix A in Elperin et al. (2002) using the budget
equations for the turbulent kinetic energy, ﬂuctuations of
the entropy and the turbulent heat ﬂux. The anisotropic
part of the tensor κij (the second term in the square
brackets) is caused by a modiﬁcation of the turbulent
heat ﬂux by the buoyancy eﬀects. The parameter α is
given by

lh = lz the parameter ξ = 0 and α = 1. For lh ≪ lz the
parameter ξ = −1 and α = −9/2. The maximum value
ξmax of the parameter ξ is given by ξmax = 2/3 for α = 3.
The upper limit for the parameter ξ arises because the
function F ∗
z (r) has a global maximum at r = 0. Thus, for
α < 1 the thermal structures have the form of columns
or thermal jets (lh < lz), and for α > 1 there exist the
‘’pancake” thermal structures (lh > lz) in the background
turbulent convection (i.e., a turbulent convection with a
zero gradients of the mean velocity).

The terms in the square brackets in the right hand
side of Eq. (1) are caused by the anisotropic turbulence
and depend on the ”mean” (including coherent) velocity
gradients. These terms lead to the excitation of large-
scale instability and formation of coherent structures. In
Eq. (1) the terms with zero divergence are omitted, be-
cause only div F contributes to the mean-ﬁeld dynamics.
Neglecting the anisotropic turbulence term this equation
reduces to the traditional equation. The physical mean-
ing of Eq. (1) is the following. The second term in Eq. (1)
describes the redistribution of the vertical background

tion of the vertical turbulent ﬂux of the entropy and results

turbulent heat ﬂux by convergent (or divergent) horizon-
tal mean ﬂows. This redistribution of the vertical tur-
bulent heat ﬂux occurs during the life-time of turbulent
eddies. The last term in Eq. (1) determines the forma-
tion of the horizontal turbulent heat ﬂux due to ”rota-
tion” of the vertical background turbulent heat ﬂux by
the perturbations of the horizontal mean vorticity. The
emergence of the horizontal turbulent heat ﬂux is caused
by the action of the local inertial forces in inhomogeneous
mean ﬂows.

In the shear-free regime, the large-scale instability is
related to the ﬁrst term in square brackets in Eq. (1) for
the turbulent ﬂux of entropy. When ∂Uz/∂z > 0, per-
turbations of the vertical velocity Uz cause negative di-
vergence of the horizontal velocity, div Uh < 0 (provided
that div U = 0). This strengthens the local vertical tur-
bulent ﬂux of entropy and causes increase of the local
”mean” entropy and buoyancy (see Fig. 1). The latter
enhances the local ”mean” vertical velocity Uz. Thus
a large-scale instability is excited. Similar reasoning is
valid when ∂Uz/∂z < 0, whereas div Uh > 0. Then

a negative perturbation of the vertical ﬂux of entropy
leads to a decrease of the ”mean” entropy and buoyancy,
that enhances the downward ﬂow and once again excites
the instability. Therefore, nonzero div Uh causes redis-
tribution of the vertical turbulent ﬂux of entropy and
formation of regions with large values of this ﬂux. These
regions (where div Uh < 0) alternate with the low-ﬂux
regions (where div Uh > 0). By this means large-scale
coherent structures are formed.

The role of the second term in square brackets in
Eq. (1) is to decrease the growth rate of the large-scale

the ”mean” vorticity with the vertical ﬂux of entropy
produces the horizontal turbulent heat ﬂux. The latter
decreases (increases) the ”mean” entropy in the regions
with upward (downward) local ﬂows, thus diminishing
the buoyancy forces and reducing the ”mean” vertical
velocity Uz and the ”mean” vorticity W. This mecha-
nism dampens the large-scale instability.

The above two competitive eﬀects determine the
growth rate of the large-scale instability. Perturbation
analysis of the mean-ﬁeld equations in the shear-free con-
vection regime results in the following expression for the
growth rate γ of long-wave perturbations:

where we took into account that the parameter α varies
in the interval −9/2 < α < 3. The ﬁrst range for
the large-scale instability in Eq. (5) is for the angles
3/10 ≤ cos2 θ ≤ 1 (the ratio 0 < Lz/Lh < 1.53), and the
second range for the large-scale instability (see Eq. (6))
corresponds to the angles 0 ≤ cos2 θ < 2/15 (the ratio
2.55 < Lz/Lh < ∞), where Lz/Lh ≡ Kh/Kz = tan θ
and Kh is the horizontal component of the wave vec-
tor. The maximum growth rate of the large-scale insta-
bility is achieved at the scale of perturbations L ≈ 10 l,

where L ≡ 1/
h . The characteristic time of
excitation of the large-scale instability is of the order of
20 − 30 τ . Therefore, the typical length and time scales
of these structures are much larger than the turbulence
scales. This justiﬁes the separation of scales assump-
tion required for treating coherent structures as albeit

complex but ”mean” ﬂow. The growth rate of the large-
scale instability depends also on the degree of anisotropy
of turbulent velocity ﬁeld. The detailed analysis of this
facet is performed in Section 4 in order to explain the
obtained experimental results.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

Now we describe the experimental study of large-scale
circulations formed in turbulent convection. The exper-
iments were conducted in a rectangular chamber with
dimensions 26 × 58 × 26 cm in air ﬂow (see Fig. 2). The
side walls of the chamber are made of transparent Per-
spex with the thickness of 10 mm. A number of experi-
ments were also conducted with diﬀerent additional ther-
mal insulation of the side walls of the chamber in order to
study whether a heat ﬂux through the side walls aﬀects
the turbulent convective pattern. First, the side walls of
the chamber were insulated with Styrofoam plates with
low thermal conductivity (κ ∼ 0.033 W/(m K)) and with
the thickness of 30 mm. Two of the side plates were re-
moved for a short time when the images of the ﬂow were
recorded. In the next series of experiments we installed
additional Perspex plates with a thickness of 6 mm and
with an air gap of 2 mm between these plates and the
outside walls of the chamber. Finally, we performed ex-
periments where these two types of thermal insulation
were used simultaneously.

One vertically oriented stationary grid (with 50 mm
mesh and 10 mm bars where bars are arranged in a square
array) was attached to the left horizontal rod. This grid
was positioned at a distance of one mesh size from the
left wall of the chamber parallel to it. Hereafter, we use
the following system of coordinates: Z is the vertical axis,
the Y -axis is perpendicular to the grid and the XZ-plane
is parallel to the grid plane.

A vertical mean temperature gradient in the turbulent
ﬂow was formed by attaching two aluminium heat ex-

changers to the bottom and top walls of the test section
(a heated bottom and a cooled top wall of the chamber).
The thickness of the aluminium plates is 2.5 cm. The
top plate is a bottom wall of the tank with cooling wa-
ter. Temperature of water circulating through the tank
and the chiller is kept constant within 0.1 K. Cold wa-
ter is pumped into the tank through two inlets and ﬂows
out through two outlets located at the side wall of the
chamber. The bottom plate is attached to the electrical
heater that provides constant and uniform heating. The
voltage of a stable power supply applied to the heater
varies in the range from 35 V to 200 V. The power of the
heater varies in the range from 10 W to 300 W. The tem-
peratures of the conducting plates were measured with
two thermocouples attached at the surface of each plate.
The temperature diﬀerence between the top and bottom
plates, ∆T , varies in the range from 5 K to 80 K depend-
ing on the power of the heater (i.e., the Rayleigh number
was changed within the range of Ra = 107 − 1.6 × 108).
The temperature in the probed region was measured with
a specially designed temperature probe with twelve sen-
sitive thermocouples. The temperature measurements
showed that the thermal structure inside the large-scale
circulation is inhomogeneous and anisotropic. The hot
thermal plumes accumulate at one side of the large-scale
circulation, and cold plumes concentrate at the opposite
side of the large-scale circulation.

The velocity ﬁeld was measured using a Particle Im-
age Velocimetry (PIV), see Raﬀel et al. (1998). A digi-
tal PIV system with LaVision Flow Master III was used.
A double-pulsed light sheet was provided by a Nd-YAG
laser (Continuum Surelite 2 × 170 mJ). The light sheet
optics includes spherical and cylindrical Galilei telescopes
with tuneable divergence and adjustable focus length.
We used two progressive-scan 12 bit digital CCD cam-
eras (with pixel size 6.7 µm ×6.7 µm and 1280 × 1024
pixels) with a dual-frame-technique for cross-correlation
processing of captured images. A programmable Timing
Unit (PC interface card) generated sequences of pulses
to control the laser, camera and data acquisition rate.
The software package LaVision DaVis 7 was applied to
control all hardware components and for 32 bit image ac-
quisition and visualization. This software package com-
prises PIV software for calculating the ﬂow ﬁelds using
cross-correlation analysis.

An incense smoke with sub-micron particles as a tracer
was used for the PIV measurements. Smoke was pro-
duced by high temperature sublimation of solid incense
particles. Analysis of smoke particles using a microscope
(Nikon, Epiphot with an ampliﬁcation of 560) and a PM-
300 portable laser particulate analyzer showed that these
particles have an approximately spherical shape and that
their mean diameter is of the order of 0.7µm. The proba-
bility density function of the particle size measured with
the PM300 particulate analyzer was independent of the
location in the ﬂow for incense particle size of 0.5 − 1 µm.
Series of 130 pairs of images acquired with a frequency
of 4 Hz were stored for calculating the velocity maps and

for ensemble and spatial averaging of turbulence charac-
teristics. The center of the probed ﬂow region coincides
with the center of the chamber. We measured the velocity
ﬁeld in the ﬂow areas 487.5 × 240 mm2 with a spatial res-
olution of 234.7µm / pixel. These regions were analyzed
with interrogation windows of 32 × 32 pixels. A velocity
vector was determined in every interrogation window, al-
lowing us to construct a velocity map comprising 65 × 32
vectors.

Mean and r.m.s. velocities, two-point correlation func-
tions and an integral scale of turbulence were deter-
mined from the measured velocity ﬁelds. The mean and
r.m.s. velocities for each point of the velocity map (1024
points) were determined by averaging over 130 indepen-
dent maps. The two-point correlation functions of the
velocity ﬁeld were determined for each point of the cen-
tral part of the velocity map (32 × 32 vectors) by aver-
aging over 130 independent velocity maps. An integral
scale l of turbulence was determined from the two-point
correlation functions of the velocity ﬁeld. These measure-
ments were repeated for various temperature diﬀerences
between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber.
The size of the probed region did not aﬀect our results.
Similar experimental set-up and data processing proce-
dure were used in experimental study by Eidelman et al.
(2002; 2004) and Buchholz et al. (2004) of a new phe-
nomenon of turbulent thermal diﬀusion (see Elperin et
al. 1996; 1997; 2001).

The maximum tracer particle displacement in the ex-
periment was of the order of 8 pixels, i.e., 1/4 of the in-
terrogation window. The average displacement of tracer
particles was of the order of 2.5 pixels. Therefore, the av-
erage accuracy of the velocity measurements was of the
order of 4% for the accuracy of the correlation peak de-
tection in the interrogation window of the order of 0.1
pixels (see, e.g., Adrian 1991; Westerweel 1997; 2000).

IV. HYSTERESIS PHENOMENON

In this Section we discuss the hysteresis phenomenon
which was found in the turbulent convection by varying
the temperature diﬀerence between the bottom and the
top walls of the chamber within a range of 5 to 80 K

the chamber A = 2.23 is kept constant. In particular,
increasing the temperature diﬀerence from 5 to 15 K we
observed ﬁrst two-cell ﬂow pattern with the downward
motions in the central region of the chamber between
two cells (Fig. 3a), then one-cell ﬂow pattern within a
range of the temperature diﬀerence of 20 to 30 K with the
counterclockwise mean ﬂow (Fig. 3b). Further increase
of the temperature diﬀerence from 35 to 80 K results in
two-cell ﬂow pattern with the upward mean ﬂow in the
central region of the chamber between the two cells (Fig.
3c). Decreasing the temperature diﬀerence we observed
two-cell ﬂow pattern within a range from 80 to 45 K with
the upward ﬂow in the region between two cells (Fig.
4a), then one-cell ﬂow pattern with clockwise mean ﬂow
within a range of the temperature diﬀerence of 40 to 20 K
(Fig. 4b). Further decrease of the temperature diﬀerence
from 15 to 5 K results in two-cell ﬂow pattern with the
downward mean ﬂow in the central region of the chamber
between the two cells (Fig. 4c).

During the transition from the two-cell to one-cell ﬂow
patterns, the direction of the mean ﬂow in the one-cell
pattern coincided with that of the right cell in the two-cell
ﬂow pattern. The latter may be caused by an asymmetry
of the chamber due to the presence of the grid near the
left wall. This grid introduces an additional anisotropy in
the small-scale turbulent convection. In all experiments
the transition from the two-cell to one-cell ﬂow patterns
was found to be accompanied by the change of the sign
of the degree of anisotropy χ of turbulent velocity ﬁeld,
which is deﬁned as

χ =

In particular, the dependence of the degree of anisotropy
χ of turbulent velocity ﬁeld on the Rayleigh number ob-
tained in the experiment is shown in Fig. 5. The param-
eter χ was negative for the two-cell ﬂow pattern and was
positive for the one-cell ﬂow pattern.

These experimental observations can be explained by
invoking the theory of formation of coherent structures
developed by Elperin et al. (2002; 2005). In particular,
Fig. 6 shows the theoretical dependence of the growth
rate of the large-scale instability versus the parameter χ
for the one-cell and two-cell ﬂow patterns. Note that the
aspect ratio of the large-scale cell in the two-cell ﬂow pat-
tern observed in the experiment was approximately 1 (see
Figs. 3a; 3c; 4a; 4c), while in the one-cell ﬂow pattern it
was approximately 2 (see Figs. 3b; 4b). The growth rate
of the large-scale instability for the two-cell mode, γ2, is
larger than that for the one-cell mode, γ1, for negative
values of the degree of anisotropy χ of turbulent velocity
ﬁeld, and γ2 < γ1 for positive values of the parameter χ.
Figure 6 is plotted for the degree of thermal anisotropy
α = 1.7.

ﬂow patterns versus the degree of thermal anisotropy
α is shown in Fig. 7. The range of parameters where
∆γ > 0, corresponds to the two-cell ﬂow pattern, since
in this range the growth rate of the excitation of the two-
cell mode is larger than that of the one-cell mode. Ac-
cordingly, the range of parameters where ∆γ < 0, corre-
sponds to the one-cell ﬂow pattern, because in this range
the growth rate of the excitation of the two-cell mode is
smaller than that of the one-cell mode. Let us deﬁne the
point χ = χb for a given parameter α where ∆γ = 0. The
dependence of the bifurcation point χb versus the degree
of thermal anisotropy α is shown in Fig. 8. The value χb
increases with the increase of the parameter α.

Note that the range of the degree of thermal anisotropy
α when two kinds of ﬂow patterns (the two-cell and one-
cell ﬂow patterns) can exist in the system is very nar-
row. For instance, when −0.3 ≤ χ ≤ 0.3 the parameter
α changes within the range between 1.63 and 1.77 (see

ment with the experimental observations. In particular,
our preliminary measurements show that the degree of
thermal anisotropy α in the chamber in the experiments
was of the order of 1 − 2. Therefore, the above discus-
sion shows that the obtained experimental results are in
a good agreement with the predictions of the theory of
formation of coherent structures in turbulent convection
(see Elperin et al. 2002; 2005).

A number of experiments were also conducted with
diﬀerent additional thermal insulation of the side walls
of the chamber in order to study whether a heat ﬂux

gree of anisotropy χ of turbulent velocity ﬁeld versus the
Rayleigh number for the chamber with additional ther-
mal insolation with Perspex plates (dashed line) and for
the experiments without the additional thermal insola-
tion (solid line) in the case of increase of the Rayleigh
number (Fig. 9a) and during decrease of Ra (Fig. 9b).
The diﬀerence in the dependence χ(Ra) was not essential,
and the hysteresis phenomenon was observed in these ex-
periments as well.

Notably, the vertical grid (see Fig. 2) which has been
placed asymmetrically, introduces additional anisotropy
in turbulent ﬂuid ﬂow in a chamber. Without this ver-
tical grid the dynamics of ﬂow patterns becomes more
complicated.
In particular, after a two-cell ﬂow pat-
tern at higher values of the Rayleigh number we often
observed an additional transition to the one-cell ﬂow
pattern. However, we did observe the hysteresis phe-
nomenon in this case. When we also changed the aspect
ratio from A = 2 to A = 2.23, the hysteresis phenomenon
was observed as well.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present study we demonstrated that

the
anisotropy of turbulent velocity ﬁeld plays a crucial role
in the hysteresis phenomenon that was found in our ex-
periments in turbulent convection. The hysteresis loop
comprises the two-cell and one-cell ﬂow patterns while
the aspect ratio of the chamber is kept constant. The
observed transition from the two-cell to one-cell ﬂow pat-
terns causes a drastic change of the degree of anisotropy
χ of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld from negative to pos-
itive values. This ﬁnding is in a good agreement with
the theoretical predictions. In particular, we found that
there is a critical value χb of the degree of anisotropy of
turbulent velocity ﬁeld when the growth rate of the large-
scale instability for the one-cell ﬂow pattern is larger than
that for the two-cell ﬂow pattern. This critical value de-
pends on the degree of thermal anisotropy. Transition
through this critical value χb results in a bifurcation,
i.e., it causes the transition from the two-cell to one-cell
ﬂow patterns. Then further increase of the temperature
diﬀerence between the bottom and the top walls of the
chamber decreases the degree of anisotropy χ, and the
system passes again through the bifurcation from one-cell
to two-cell ﬂow patterns. Decreasing the temperature dif-
ference causes these bifurcations but for diﬀerent values
of the temperature diﬀerence. Therefore, we observed
the hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection. The
developed theory of coherent large-scale circulations in
turbulent convection (Elperin et al. 2002; 2005) is in a
good agreement with the experimental observations.

Note that the nonlinear dynamics may play a very es-
sential role in the observed transitions between one-cell
ﬂow pattern to the two-cell ﬂow pattern (and vice versa)
when we change the values of the Rayleigh numbers.
After parametrization of the turbulence the nonlinear

8

mean-ﬁeld equations determine the dynamics of modes
(ﬂow patterns). In our experiments with A = 2 − 2.23 we
have a two-mode system (one-cell and two-cell modes),
and nonlinear interactions between the modes play a very
essential role. Experiments and numerical simulations
with large aspect ratios (Willis et al. 1972; Fitzjarrald
1976; Hartlep et al. 2003) can be regarded as a multi-
mode system, which may be strongly diﬀerent from the
two-mode system.

The obtained results might be important in atmo-
spheric turbulent convection (see, e.g., Zilitinkevich 1991;
Etling and Brown 1993; Atkinson and Wu Zhang 1996;
Br¨ummer 1999) and industrial turbulent ﬂows (see, e.g.,
Kakac et al. 1987; Incropera and DeWitt 2002).

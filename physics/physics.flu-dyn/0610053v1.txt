Abstract
To investigate the ﬁnite time singularity in three-dimensional (3D) Euler ﬂows, the simpliﬁed
model of 3D axisymmetric incompressible ﬂuids (i.e., two-dimensional Boussinesq approximation
equations) is studied numerically. The system describes a cap-like hot zone of ﬂuid rising from
the bottom, while the edges of the cap lag behind, forming eye-like vortices. The hot liquid is
driven by the buoyancy and meanwhile attracted by the vortices, which leads to the singularity-
forming mechanism in our simulation. In the previous 2D Boussinesq simulations, the symmetricial
initial data is used, see, e.g., [20]. However, it is observed that the adoption of symmetry leads to
coordinate singularity. Moreover, as demonstrated in this work that the locations of peak values for
the vorticity and the temperature gradient becomes far apart as t approaches the predicted blow-up
time. This suggests that the symmetry assumption may be unreasonable for searching solution
blow-ups. One of the main contributions of this work is to propose an appropriate asymmetric
initial condition, which avoids coordinate singularity and also makes the blow-up to occur much
earlier than that given by the previously simulations. The shorter simulation time suppresses
the development of the round-oﬀ error. On the numerical side, the pseudo-spectral method with
ﬁltering technique is adopted. The resolutions adopted in this study vary from 10242, 20482, 40962
to 61442. With our proposed asymmetric initial condition, it is shown that the 40962 and 61442
runs yield convergent results when t is fairly close to the predicted blow-up time. Moreover, as
expected the locations of peak values for the vorticity and the temperature gradient are very close
to each other as t approaches the predicted blow-up time.

INTRODUCTION

The formation of ﬁnite time singularities in the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible
Euler equations is a controversial subject in ﬂuid mechanics. There are two main reasons for
studying the singularity development: ﬁrstly, the veriﬁcation of the ﬁnite time singularity
may aid to the understanding of the onset of turbulence in slightly viscous ﬂows, and secondly
if such singularities do exist then they may provide a means by which energy cascades to
and concentrates on small scales.

The equations under consideration are the following:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

ut + u · ∇u + ∇p = 0,
∇ · u = 0,
u(x, 0) = u0,

where, u is the velocity, p is the pressure, u0 is the given initial velocity which is smooth in
the sense that the data reside in some Sobolov space. However, whether the solution u can
remain smooth for all time has yet to be proved.

Since the question of global existence of the 3D incompressible Euler equations has been
inaccessible analytically, the question has been investigated numerically in the past two
decades. The most commonly used quantity in determining global existence of Eqs. (1)-(3)
is the vorticity ω = ∇ × u, which has been ﬁrst developed by Beale, Kato & Majda [1]
(also see [2]), and later reﬁned by two other groups [3, 4]. It is shown in [1] that u will blow
up at a ﬁnite time Tc if and only if

t

Z
0

| ω|L∞ds → ∞, as t ր Tc .

This result is especially useful when the question of global existence is numerically investi-
gated, because if we ﬁnd the maximum norm of the vorticity behaves like (Tc − t)−α with
α > 1, a ﬁnite time singularity has then developed. Based on this theory, three kinds
of numerical eﬀorts have been made to search for the singularities in the 3D Euler ﬂows
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]:

1. The original 3D Euler simulation does not adopt symmetric assumption. This scheme

requires the largest computer resource.

2. The symmetry introduced by Taylor & Green [5] (see also [6] for some detailed dis-
cussion) uses only 1/64 of the total computational time for the non-symmetric case.

3. An even further symmetric technique introduced by Kida [7] requires only 1/192 of

the computational time for the non-symmetric case.

In contrast to the 3D research, 2D study is much easier to be performed analytically or
numerically. Under the axisymmetric assumption, the 3D Euler equations can be replaced by
2D Boussinesq convection equations. This assumption is an even more aggressive symmetric
assumption than the Taylor-Green or Kida ﬂows because it turns this 3D problem into a 2D

2

one, which can save computer resource signiﬁcantly. We will give a brief discussion about it
in Section II. Similar to the 3D theory, the blowup judgment has been developed for the 2D
Boussinesq convection ﬂows [20, 21, 22]. It has been realized that if the maximum absolute
values of the vorticity and temperature gradient behave like (Tc − t)−α and (Tc − t)−β with
α > 1 and β > 2, a ﬁnite time singularity will be developed. This simpliﬁed 2D model,
although lacking of the vortex reconnection as in the 3D simulations [23, 24, 25], can also
reveal certain possibility of singularity formation [20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].

Among the numerical eﬀorts in addressing the singularity issue, some highest possible
resolutions have been attempted in the last two decades. There are mainly two kinds of
numerical schemes involved: pseudo-spectral methods and ﬁnite diﬀerences. For the pseudo-
spectral eﬀorts, Kerr used the resolution up to 1024 × 256 × 128 without any symmetric
assumption [10], and in a recent work of Hou and Li
[19] an extremely ﬁne grid of resolu-
tion 1536 × 1024 × 3072 is used. The Taylor-Green or Kida simulations have reached the
eﬀective resolution of 10243 [12] and 20483 [18]. Moreover, the most intensive axisymmetric
simulation [20] uses a resolution of 15002.

To the best of out knowledge, the most intensive 3D ﬁnite diﬀerence calculation was
performed by Grauer et al. [14]. They did not make any symmetric assumption, but used the
adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) method to enhance the eﬀective resolution to 20483. For
the 2D Boussinesq simulation, uniform grids of 5122 and 1792 × 1280 were used in [20] and
[30], respectively. Pumir & Siggia [28] employed an adaptive 2562 grid to achieve a resolution
of 107 in both dimensions. A less aggressive adaptive grid, maybe more accurate due to less
frequent re-meshing, uses a 5122 deformed grid to reach a 46002 eﬀective resolution [32].

Besides the numerical eﬀorts mentioned above, the 3D Taylor series analysis, although
limited due to the lack of proper parallelized softwares handling high precision calculations,
is also used to analyze the 3D Euler singularity problem [33, 34, 35, 36]. Moreover, some
analytical studies have been carried out [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46], but the original
3D Euler equations have been modiﬁed which makes the use of relevant mathematical tools
possible, Likewise, some 2D modiﬁed Boussinesq equations were also employed in simulations
and analysis [47, 48, 49, 50]. Although these models do not have much connection with
the original 3D Euler equations, they may provide some hints to the understanding of
the singularity issue. One of the latest results was given by Frisch et al.
[51, 52] who
conducted the 2D calculations in the so-called parareal domain by taking the advantages of
both spectral and adaptive methods.

One of the main purposes of this work is to investigate how to set up an eﬀective initial
condition which can be used in the simulations of the Boussinesq equations. The reason
that we emphasize the importance of proper initial conditions is that a poorly chosen initial
condition may not lead to blowup or may lead to blowup at a numerically unacceptable
large time.

Section II contains a brief discussion on our numerical method. We adopted the so-called
phase-shifted technique to do the de-aliasing [53, 54].
It is clear that to a reliable and
eﬃcient numerical is very important in simulating possible singular behaviors. Section III
gives a quite complete discussion of three initial conditions, including subtle but signiﬁcant

3D axisymmetric ﬂows (see Fig. 3(a)). The solid black arrow at the bottom indicates the direction

diﬀerences from earlier work. In section V, we use the parallel strategy combined with the
traditional parallel FFT and task distribution schemes [55, 56] to solve the 2D Boussinesq
equations with resolutions up to 61442. The corresponding eﬀective resolution in the 3D
Euler formulation is π × 61443 ≃ 90003, which is much ﬁner than any previous eﬀorts.
Singularity development will be demonstrated by considering several physical quantities
including the peak vorticity and temperature gradient.

II. THE NUMERICAL SCHEME

The connection between the 3D axisymmetric Euler ﬂow with swirl and the 2D Boussinesq
convection has been established in [2]. For completeness, we will review the connection
brieﬂy.

The basic vorticity equations for the axisymmetric swirling ﬂow in the (r, θ, z) cylindrical

coordinates are of the form

It should be realized that the (z, r) plane is essentially two dimensional ﬂows with (x, y)
coordinate system (Fig. 1). By introducing a streamfunction ψ, the 2D inviscid Boussinesq
equations have the following form:

θt + u · ∇θ = 0,
ωt + u · ∇ω = −θx,
∆ψ = −ω,

(9)

(10)

(11)

where the gravitational constant is normalized to g = (0, −1), θ the temperature, u = (u,v)
the velocity, ω = (0, 0, ω) = ∇×u vorticity, and ψ the stream function. It should be pointed
out in the remaining of the work θ is diﬀerent with that indicated in (5)-(6); it denotes the
temperature. Comparing with the pure 2D Euler equations with the streamfunction-vorticity
ω-ψ formulation, there is an extra temperature equation, i.e. Eq. (9), and an extra term θx
associated with the Buoyancy in Eq. (10). Actually, if ωθ in Eqs. (5-8) is replaced by ω,
and (rvθ)2 by ρ, a link can be established if we evaluate all external variable coeﬃcients in
Eq. (5-8) at r = 1. It should be noticed that this link leads to some coordinate singularities
under the cylindrical coordinates. Consequently, it is essential to keep the corresponding 2D
Boussinesq solutions away from the horizontal boundaries (here, in this paper, y = 0 and
y = 2π; see Figs. 1 and Fig. 3(a)).

The method used in our numerical simulation is pseudo-spectral approximations with
some proper de-aliasing technique. We also adopt the ﬁltering technique [59] (a careful
discussion on ﬁlter in turbulence simulations can be found in [60]) to modify the Fourier
coeﬃcients such that the stability of the numerical scheme is enhanced. The machine accu-
racy of our computer with double precision is ǫ = 10−16 ≈ e−37, and the modifying factor in
the ﬁlter is ϕ(k) = e−37(2k/N )16
for k < N/2, where N is the Fourier modes in each direction.
We now brieﬂy discuss the eﬀects of diﬀerent numerical schemes for the current research.
As to be shown later, the main concern is whether or not a δ or δ-like function can be well
resolved by using a discrete scheme. It is well known that the spectral coeﬃcients of the δ
function is constant for diﬀerent modes:

If the resolution N 2 → ∞,
where C is a constant and will be set to 1 in the following.
we will get the exact Fourier representation. Of course, it is impossible to do this by any
computer, and what we can do is to use some ﬁnest possible grid (the largest N 2 appearing
in the literature is limited to 81922 so far [57]). The de-aliasing technique is to remove the
aliasing error by setting some of the Fourier coeﬃcients to zero. The ﬁlter we adopted is to
make some of the Fourier coeﬃcients smaller. So actually, the computer-represented value
of the δ function is determined by the resolution N 2, the ﬁlter and the de-aliasing.

The de-aliasing scheme to be used is the so-called phase-shift scheme [54], which retains
about 7/9 of the total modes. The ﬁlter narrows the gap of the peak values of de-aliasing
pseudo-spectral schemes and pure spectral schemes. In Table I, the ﬁltering δ function value

of phase-shift scheme is only 2% lower than the no de-aliasing scheme. In our calculation, we
follow the tradition of our pseudo-spectral code (W. H. Matthaeus, private communication)
to use the circular truncation in our running [58].

III.

INITIAL CONDITIONS

In this paper, three diﬀerent initial conditions will be considered, which will be named
RUN A, RUN B and RUN C, respectively. RUN A adopted the same initial condition as
used in Ref

[20]:

ω(x, y, 0) = 0,

θ(x, y, 0) = 50θ1(x, y)θ2(x, y) [1 − θ1(x, y)] ,

(13)

(14)

where if S(x, y) := π2−y2−(x−π)2 is positive, θ1 = exp (1 − π2/S(x, y)), and zero otherwise;
if s(y) := |y − 2π| /1.95π is less than 1, θ2 = exp (1 − (1 − s(y)2)−1), and zero otherwise. By
choosing the initial conditions (13)-(14), we can test our discretization schemes by comparing
our numerical results with those given in [20].

This governing equations (9)-(11) with the above initial condition have been studied
intensively by E & Shu [20] with spectral methods (resolutions: 15002) and ENO ﬁnite
diﬀerence methods (resolutions: 5122). They have predicted that the side part of the rising

bubble is much more dangerous than the front of the bubble (Fig. 2(a)). However, this
initial condition has two shortcomings:

• It introduces another symmetry assumption besides the axisymmetric assumption de-
scribed in the previous section: the symmetry respect to x = π in the (x, y) plane.
This will cause a further deviation from the original 3D non-symmetric Euler ﬂows.

• It is demonstrated that the blow-up time of this ﬂow is after t = 3.16, at which both
y = 0 and y = 2π are crossed by non-zero velocity, see Fig. 2(a). This is due to the
assumption we adopted to simplify the 3D axisymmetric ﬂow to the 2D Boussinesq

ﬂow. In other words, what we are studying here can not be closely related to the 3D
Euler ﬂow anymore.

To ﬁx the ﬁrst diﬃculty above, we change the initial temperature ﬁeld in (14) to

θ(x, y, 0) =

(4x − 3π)θ1(x, y)θ2(x, y) [1 − θ1(x, y)] .

(15)

50
π

The factor (4x − 3π)/π introduced here is to break the symmetry assumption with respect
to x = π in the (x, y) plane. However, this simulation (denoted as RUN B) will also cross
both y = 0 and y = 2π (see Fig. 2(b)) before Tc. Therefore, a better initial condition (RUN
C) is to compress the intermediate results at t = 1.2 obtained in RUN B. More precisely, we
let

ω(x, y, 0) = ω′(x, 2y − 0.4π, 1.2),

θ(x, y, 0) = θ′(x, 2y − 0.4π, 1.2),

(16)

for (x, y) ∈ [0, 2π] × [0, π] (where θ′ and ω′ are obtained by solving Eqs. (9)-(11), (13) and
(15) with a 20482 grid), and zero otherwise. The initial condition associated with RUN C is
demonstrated in Figs. 3(b, c, d).

There are three main advantages for using the above initial conditions with RUN C:

• There will have no symmetric and boundary crossing problems as observed in RUN A.
The ﬂow pattern does not cross the horizontal boundary until t = 2 (Fig. 2(c)) while
the predicted blow-up time is around t = 0.91 (see Section IV B).

• Compared with RUN A, RUN C only needs about 1/4 simulation time to reach the
blow-up time Tc, and the advantages of higher resolutions show up at early stages of
the simulations. As a result, RUN C can save quite large amount of computational
time, which is particularly important in this kind of study.

• Shorter simulation time also suppresses the development of round-oﬀ error, which is

non-trivial in the current high resolution simulations (see Appendix).

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we will present a detail discussion of the numerical results of RUN A and
RUN C. Some features of Run B can be represented by RUN A and C, and will be only
brieﬂy discussed. RUN A will serve as a validate run. Moreover, it is used to illustrate some
pitfalls we should avoid, such as round-oﬀ error, symmetric eﬀect, and coordinate singularity
etc. RUN C is the simulation from which we will draw main conclusions.

A. Numerical results for RUN A

For RUN A, three resolutions are used: 10242, 20482 and 40962. The corresponding time

steps used are 0.00004, 0.00002 and 0.00001 respectively, given by the CFL condition.

At the beginning of the simulations (for all three resolutions), the cap-like initial tempera-
ture ﬁeld (Fig. 3(a)) will rise and develop into a “two-eye” system. Driven by the buoyancy,
the vorticity ﬁeld will also develop from the initially uniﬁed zero to a two-eye system, but
with one positive and one negative “eyes” this time. Figs. 4 and 5 show the 3D pictures of
vorticity and temperature ﬁeld in the whole domain, and it is clear that the peak values of
vorticity are located along the edge of the “eyes.”

The system is basically symmetric respect to x = π if round-oﬀ error does not play a role,
so there will have two |ω|max locations: one positive and one negative. It is worth mentioning
that round-oﬀ error will spoil this symmetry when very high resolutions are adopted (see
the discussion in Appendix). Our highest resolution for RUN A is 40962, and the symmetry
is well maintained before t = 3.6. After t = 3.6, the ﬁlter spoils the singularity-forming
mechanism, and the values of |ω|max begin to drop when t becomes larger. In the following,
we will only use the positive half of the vorticity ﬁeld (i.e. x ∈ [π, 2π]) for the divergence
analysis.

The “+” symbol in Figs. 6 indicates the locations of |ω|max at diﬀerent times. The “+”
is around y = 3 in the beginning, and suddenly jumps to y ≈ 4.5 after t = 3.1. The ﬂow
ﬁeld has no signiﬁcant change around t = 3.1, and the front of the bubble rises continuously
as what happens before that time.

The “*” symbol in Figs. 7 indicates the locations of |∇θ|max at diﬀerent times. It should
be noticed that the tail left behind the rising front is forming an “eye” after t = 2.5, and
there is a smooth ﬁlament connecting the “eye” and the head of the bubble.

The “∗” symbol jumps to the edges of the forming “eye” around t ≈ 3.6, roughly at the
same time when the original smooth ﬁlament breaks up into many even smaller “eyes” (see
Figs. 16). This is because our simulation begins to become under-resolved. The ﬁlter begins
to dramatically reduce the peak values of those δ-like functions. The “*” symbols can not

Questions arise as to how eﬀectively the large local quantity (in our case, the vorticity and
temperature gradients) can be resolved and how much the results vary with resolution. It
is evident that for the extreme hypothetical case, when one of the local quantities is a delta
function, it can only be resolved with inﬁnite resolution. To resolve an ideal shock wave
(with zero thickness), for example, in the absence of any smoothing, needs inﬁnite number
of grid points. In the following, we will check several other aspects on the eﬀectiveness of the
numerical simulations, mainly by ﬁnding some quantity properties useful in demonstrating
the eﬀect of the mesh reﬁnement, or identifying the trend when high resolutions are adopted.
First, we check the following three values which are time independent due to the
divergence-free constraint, the doubly-periodic condition and the inviscid transport equation

Fig. 8 shows that the global average quantities are well conserved within 1% error for
40962 and 20482 resolutions throughout the entire simulation period t ∈ [0, 4]. To save the
computation time, our 40962 run starts from t = 2.0 using the intermediate result of 20482, so
for 40962 run, those errors are deﬁned as (T2(2.0) − T2(t))/T2(2.0), (T4(2.0) − T4(t))/T4(2.0)
and |θmax(2.0) − θmax(t)|/|θmax(2.0)|.

The 10242 run has a very poor performance after t = 3.8 because none of these relative
errors are below 10%. The performance of 20482 run is almost as good as on 40962 grid by
considering T2 and T4, with under 1% relative errors. However, the relative errors on θmax of
40962 are always below 10−4, which are only about 2% of the errors in 20482 simulation after
t = 3.5 (Figs. 8(c)). These errors give some indicators on how far the numerical solution is
away from the real one.

Figs. 8(a) and (b) show that T2 and T4 errors of 40962 run are always lower than those
given by the 10242 and 20482 simulations. However, due to the round-oﬀ error in our
calculations (see Appendix), this is not the case for θmax error (Figs. 8(c)), because the
errors associated with the 40962 resolution seems to be at the same level of those with the
20482 resolution from t = 2.0 to t = 2.6. When t is close to the blow-up time, the 40962
run conserves the value of θmax much better than other runs. In fact, when t → Tc, the
truncation error will overwhelm the inﬂuence of machine precision, and higher resolutions
have more advantages than lower ones. For future simulations, however, we may have to
take some measures to control the round-oﬀ error when reﬁned grids are used, say, the
quadruple precision (the machine accuracy ǫ = 10−32) may be used to replace the present
double-precision (ǫ = 10−16). On the other hand, the present results of 20482 and 40962
simulations seem to be accurate enough to draw some conclusions in the blow-up analysis.
Figs. 9(a) and (c) show the time evolutions for |ω|max and |∇θ|max with diﬀerent resolu-
tions. We re-plot these maximum value evolutions in Figs. 9(b) and (d) with logarithmic
scales. It seems that the growth of |ω|max and |∇θ|max in the 40962 run terminates in a
ﬁnite time with |ω|max ∼ (Tc − t)−1.23 and crudely |∇θ|max ∼ (Tc − t)−2.48. The correspond-
ing predicted blow-up time is Tc = 3.72. Even for 20482 run, there is an obvious trend
towards the singularity.

However, there are still two facts that cause suspects of this conclusion:

• The simulation never reaches the blow up time Tc;

• Even for the 40962 run, we can not say that we have resolved the problem conﬁdently
because the time-evolution curves for |ω|max and |∇θ|max show quite large diﬀerences
between high and low resolutions at late stages of the simulations.

The ﬁrst point is unavoidable due to the discrete nature of the numerical simulations. The
second point may be improved by employing higher resolution, or, at least we can extend

13

the overlapping region to a time closer to Tc. For example, the |ω|max(t) lines of 10242 and
20482 runs diverge around t = 2.7, but the 20482 and 40962 curves diverge around t = 3.2.
However, the eﬀort in this direction may be useless because, as explained in the following
paragraph, we can not get a clearer physical picture of the singularity forming mechanism
even we use higher resolution.

Physically speaking, if a singularity is about to form at t = Tc on the point (xc, yc),
the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max should approach (xc, yc) when t → Tc. This means the
distance between the locations of these two peak values should become smaller and smaller
as t → Tc. Although it is impossible for any numerical solver to reach Tc, we can use this
property to check whether a numerical simulation reﬂects the physical mechanism properly.
Fig. 10 shows that the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max in RUN A initially stay far away from
each other (about 1.7 length unit in the [0, 2π] × [0, 2π] domain) and they do not get closer
when the “singular” time is approaching [67]. The distance are noticeably increased after
t ≈ 1.7 for all three resolutions. When t ∈ [3.2, 3.5], it is even wider (see also the speciﬁc
locations of those maximum values in Figs. 6 and 7). The physical mechanism behind it is
very unclear, maybe because the numerical code is trying to preserve the symmetry from
[66]), accompanied by the singularity
the very beginning of ﬂow pattern (Chapter 2 of
forming mechanism. It seems that there are at least two locations at which the singularity
is formed simultaneously at x ∈ [π, 2π], ﬁghting for the locations of global maximum values.
Because the divergent conclusion drawn from Figs. 9(b) and (d) means nothing unless higher
resolutions are adopted, we should consider some other initial condition which may reveal
more physical phenomena more eﬀectively. The results of RUN A seem too complicated to
be analyzed.

To sum up for this subsection, we basically end up with similar conclusion as in [20]
in the sense that the edge of the “cap” is more dangerous than the front. Although our
code can resolve the 2D Boussinesq equations accurately until about t ≈ 3.5 on the 40962
grid, we can not obtain a clear physical picture relevant to the singularity issue for the 3D
Euler equations. RUN A can only be used to reveal some singular phenomena in the 2D
Boussinesq equations.

B. Numerical results for RUN C

In RUN C, we use four sets of grids, namely 10242, 20482, 40962 and 61442. The corre-
sponding time steps are 0.00004, 0.00002, 0.00001 and 0.000008 respectively (for 40962 run,
we use ∆t = 0.00002 for t < 0.22, and 0.00001 for t ≥ 0.22 to save the computation time).
Fig. 11 shows the 3D pictures of vorticity in the whole domain of RUN C. The rising
bubble also develops into two “eyes” like that in RUN A. In RUN C, as a whole, the positive
“eye” has much larger absolute values for |ω| and |∇θ| than those of the negative “eye.”
There is no symmetry with respect to x = π anymore. In the following, we will only exam
the details around the positive “eye” with a particular attention to the locations of the
global maximal |ω| and |∇θ| (see Fig. 12).

A noticeable diﬀerence between Fig. 12 and Fig. 6 is about the location for |ω|max. For

RUN C, from the very beginning until the collapsing time (t ≈ 0.88), the location of |ω|max is
changing continuously and smoothly without any noticeable jumping. This is quite diﬀerent
to the sudden jumping of “+” symbol in RUN A at t ≈ 3.2. The |∇θ|max is located around
x ≈ 4 in the beginning (until t ≈ 0.16, see “∗” in Fig. 12), right on the head of the rising

The “*” jumps to x ≈ 5 at t ≈ 0.18, roughly at the same time when the “eye-like” vortex
begins to form. Afterwards, the “*” symbol moves quite continuously towards the location
of |ω|max. After t = 0.7, the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max are very close to each other.
In the meanwhile, the ﬁlament connecting the cap front and the “eye” in the temperature
ﬁeld becomes thinner and thinner, which breaks down after t = 0.87 due to insuﬃcient
resolutions.

For the three low resolutions (10242, 20482 and 40962), the time evolutions of the three
time independent values T2(t), T4(t) and θmax(t) in RUN C (Fig. 13) are quite similar to the
results in RUN A (Figs. 8). Because shorter simulation time is needed, the 40962 result of
RUN C is less aﬀected by the round-oﬀ error. As a result, the 40962 curve is always below
those of two lower resolutions, see Fig. 13(c). The truncation error is the main source of
the error for these three low resolutions.

Furthermore, if we we only look at errors of T2 and T4, the 61442 results show much

better conservation property than that of the three coarser grids (Figs. 13(a) and (b)).
The θmax error, which is more easily aﬀected by the round-oﬀ error, shows no advantage of
ﬁner grids (Figs. 13(c)): for 0 ≤ t ≤ 0.6 the error of the 61442 resolutions is at the same
level as that of the 40962 resolution. However, when t > 0.6, the advantage of the 61442
resolution is observed: the error of θmax remains around 10−6 which is one order lower than
that of the 40962 result. The round-oﬀ error of 61442 can roughly match the truncation
error. This indicates that it seems necessary to employ quadruple precision instead of the
double precision if extremely ﬁner resolutions (say 105 in each dimension) are used.

Again, we investigate the time evolution of the distance between the locations of |ω|max
and |∇θ|max under the same resolution. Unlike the RUN A case (see Fig. 10), we obtain
a very clear physical picture (Fig. 14). Around t = 0.2, the distance experiences a sudden
drop, and then decays slowly. The 10242 curve has an early dramatic increase at t ≈ 0.65
due to under-resolution. The results of the 40962 and 61442 resolutions are quite satisfactory
since the distance remains small. The ﬁnest resolution shows no obvious advantage here. For
RUN A, the ﬁrst-time jump of “+” (Figs. 6) is followed by the increasing distance between
the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max (see Fig. 10). For RUN C, however, it seems that the
singularity forming mechanism is the main driving source, which leads to the decreasing
distance between the locations for |ω|max and |∇θ|max after the ﬁrst jump of “+”.

Now we can analyze the singularity forming mechanism of RUN C. We focus on the
ﬁlament connecting the cap front and the right “eye-like” vortex (see, for example, the
temperature contour plot at t = 0.8 in Figs. 12). The ﬁlament corresponds to the hotter

region of the ﬂuid ﬁeld, which will rise due to the buoyancy without any other forces. On
the other hand, the forming “eye” tries to absorb the ﬂuid around it. These two mechanisms
ﬁght with each other, which makes the ﬁlament thinner and thinner until singularity appears.
For RUN A, besides these two mechanisms, there is a third one joining the competition,
namely, the symmetry with respect to x = π. The third mechanism is not physical, but the
numerical scheme tends to preserve it throughout the simulations. With three mechanisms
working simultaneously, it is diﬃcult to know when and where the singularity will be formed,
although the time evolutions of |ω|max and |∇θ|max give some hints on solution blow-up. In
contrast, the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max in RUN C are getting closer and closer when
the solutions become singular.

We now think it is safe to carry out some singularity analysis for RUN C. Figs. 15(a)
and (c) show the time evolutions for |ω|max and |∇θ|max in diﬀerent resolutions; the inverse
of the maximum values are plotted in Figs. 15(b)(dnd ). In the following, we will pay our
attention to the 40962 and 61442 curves, because these two lines seem to be overlapping
until around t = 0.88.

For the 40962 run, there are some very small vorticity structures which begin to appear
at t = 0.84 in the lower part of the smooth outer layer where the maximum |ω| turns up.
For 61442 run, this happens at t ≥ 0.87. After this critical time, the ﬁlter we adopted in the

18

codes removes more and more energy from the system. Consequently, the global average
values like T2 are greatly aﬀected. As a result, our numerical results after t ≥ 0.87 may not
be reliable. Actually, it is observed that the |ω|max and |∇θ|max experience a drop-down after
t ≃ 0.9. This indicates that the ﬁlter prevents the occurrence of the blowup of the maximum
vorticity, which is similar to the viscosity eﬀect in high Reynolds number simulations (e.g.
[12]). For the 10242 and 20482 runs, however, the drop-downs appear later than t ≃ 0.88
and the blow-up time Tc is also delayed.

Only the sample maximum values before t = 0.86 in 61442 run will be used in the
singularity analysis because before this critical time convergence between the 40962 and
61442 results is observed. With a statistical weighted least square ﬁtting for the data after
t = 0.6, we conclude that the growth of |ω|max and |∇θ|max for RUN C terminates in a ﬁnite
time with |ω|max ∼ (Tc − t)−1.12, and crudely |∇θ|max ∼ (Tc − t)−2.38 with Tc = 0.91.

There seems to have a trend of singularity also for the 20482 run, and the 10242 result
indicates no blow-up. Moreover, the collapsing times for higher resolutions are earlier than
those of lower ones because the ﬁlter removes more energy with low resolutions, retarding
the singularity forming mechanism.

It should be noticed that the peak vorticity we obtained is the value modiﬁed directly
by the ﬁlter, and the highest peak of the δ-like function (see the peak near “+” in Fig. 11
when t = 0.86) is reduced signiﬁcantly. On the other hand, |∇θ|max is less aﬀected by the
ﬁlter because it is the temperature ﬁeld being ﬁltered (not the ∇θ ﬁeld). No place in the
temperature ﬁeld is really close to a δ-function. Hence, the temperature ﬁled is less aﬀected
by the ﬁlter than the vorticity ﬁeld. From this point of view, the |∇θ|max curve is more
accurate than the |ω|max one. If there is a blow-up in the simulation, the |∇θ|max curve will
show a stronger divergent tendency than the |ω|max one (Figs. 15).

We have not performed the simulation on grids ﬁner than 61442, but we can predict
some results from the present computations. It is well known that when a delta function
is approximated by a ﬁnite number of Fourier modes, each doubling of the resolutions will
cause doubling of the maximum value and 2n+1 times the maximum values of the nth-order
space derivative (see the analysis in Appendix A of [12]). In the ﬁnal state of our simulation
(Fig. 12 (t=0.86)), the cut-line at y = 2.72 through the out-layer of the “eye” of the vorticity
ﬁeld looks very similar to a delta function. Therefore, when ﬁner and ﬁner resolutions are
used the peak vorticity and temperature gradient are getting larger and larger. From this
point of view, further 2D Boussinesq simulations with even higher resolutions will support
our singularity prediction although it seems impossible for any code to reach the same Tc if
the current ﬁltering relevant scheme is used.

V. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

There have been extensive discussions on the 3D Euler singularity with viscous simula-
tions by using the Taylor-Green vortex and high symmetry ﬂows (the most intensive one, in
our opinion is [12]). As the Reynolds number is increased, the amplitudes of the maximum
vorticity, skewness, and ﬂatness increase, and the peaks are attained at earlier times. This is

19

quite similar to what happens to our simulation with the ﬁlter. Our simulation also reaches
an earlier “blow-up” when higher resolutions are adopted. These tendencies give hints that
for the pure inviscid case (no viscosity or ﬁlter), all these quantities may blow up.

A natural question is to discuss what is the inﬂuence with symmetry assumptions. We
tend to believe that for the Taylor-Green, high-symmetry Kida and axisymmetric ﬂow, all
the symmetry constraints are unstable, and in the absence of symmetries, the ﬂow will
escape from the singularity formation direction. Moreover, singularity formations depend
strongly on how the initial conditions are set up. The numerical method chosen has also a
strong impact on the results. For example, ﬁnite diﬀerence simulations that do not make use
of any symmetry produce no singularity indication [27] , whereas Fourier-Chebyshev [10]
simulations with symmetry constraints suggest singular trends.

To sum up, we follow the track of

[20], and end up with a more developed result. The
disagreement between the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max suggests that the symmetric initial
data proposed in [20] may not be appropriate (see Fig. 10). To ﬁx this problem, a new initial
condition is proposed in this work, which enables us to make some ﬁne grid simulations.
There are several points that make us believe that there is a singularity in RUN C:

• Our simulations show that the time evolution curves of |ω|max and |∇θ|max become

steeper when the grids are reﬁned.

• The distance between |ω|max and |∇θ|max on the 61442 and 40962 grid shows a con-

• The distance between the locations of |ω|max and |∇θ|max is small even up to the

vergent behavior near Tc.

APPENDIX: THE EFFECT OF FILTER ON ROUND-OFF ERROR

The inﬂuence of round-oﬀ errors on computation has been observed and noticed for a long
time, probably starting from the appearance of the digital computer. The round-oﬀ error
starts to occur at the very beginning of all numerical simulations, and can be ampliﬁed by
the time integration procedure. A comprehensive study on how machine precision can aﬀect
the dynamic simulation is carried out in [61]. Later, in vortex sheet roll-up simulations, a

practical result about these eﬀects with two kinds of precisions (7 and 14-digit arithmetic)
is presented [62]. In the following, we will try to give a brief analysis about the round-oﬀ
error in our simulations.

There are three ways to accumulate round-oﬀ errors in our simulations:

1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can control the initial round oﬀ error very well. Through
the result in [63, 64], we can roughly guess that the error is ampliﬁed about 100 times
for current resolutions (10242 − 40962), that is, the error will be in order of 10−13 if
the double precision (ε = 10−15) is adopted. The 40962 grid will have only slightly
larger round-oﬀ error than that of 10242 grid (only a factor of log4096/log1024 ≈ 1.2,
based on the worst possibility given in [63]).

2. The ﬁltering technique we adopted can signiﬁcantly amplify the round-oﬀ error. Ac-
2 . Here,
cording to [65], the ﬁlter will amplify the round-oﬀ error by a factor of (
ck is the factor added onto the Fourier coeﬃcients by the ﬁlter. Actually, most of ck
are 1, so roughly speaking, the round-oﬀ error will be enlarged by N times for a N 2
simulation. This means our 10242 run will have a 10−10 error for each time step, and
the error in 40962 runs is four times larger.

3. Remember that the analysis above only happens within each time step, and the real
round-oﬀ error can be even larger in a dynamic run. The time step of 40962 run is
1/4 of the 10242 run according to the CFL condition, which means 40962 needs four
times as many time steps as 10242.

As a whole, for the same simulation, the round-oﬀ error in 40962 run will be 1.2 × 4 × 4 =
19.2 times larger than that in 10242 run. This diﬀerence is already big enough to break the
initial symmetry maintained by the numerical solver. Fig. 16(a) is the contour plot of RUN

21

A at t = 4.0 with the 10242 grid, which has less details and level than the 40962 grid (Fig.
16(b)). However, Fig. 16(a) preserves the symmetry respect to x = π very well, while Fig.
16(b) has a diﬀerent number of vortices on the left and right sides of the picture. In the
main text, a discussion of the round-oﬀ error is also carried out together with Figs. 8 and
13, focusing on the round-oﬀ error ampliﬁed by the time evolution.

Figs. 16 are results after the simulation becomes under resolved. Our 40962 simulation
of RUN A is very symmetric respect to x = π before t = 3.5. The round-oﬀ error in
61442 will be about 30 times larger than that of the 10242 run. The round-oﬀ error is not
negligible comparing with truncation error for 61442 run (Fig. 13(c)), it seems a must to
adopt quadruple precision on a ﬁner grid.

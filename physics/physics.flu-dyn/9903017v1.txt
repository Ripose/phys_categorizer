Abstract

When two drops of radius R touch, surface tension drives an initially sin-

gular motion which joins them into a bigger drop with smaller surface area.

This motion is always viscously dominated at early times. We focus on the

early-time behavior of the radius rm of the small bridge between the two

drops. The ﬂow is driven by a highly curved meniscus of length 2πrm and

width ∆ ≪ rm around the bridge, from which we conclude that the leading-

order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional counter-

part. An exact two-dimensional solution for the case of inviscid surround-

ings [Hopper, J. Fluid Mech. 213, 349 (1990)] shows that ∆ ∝ r3

m and

rm ∼ (tγ/πη) ln[tγ/(ηR)]; and thus the same is true in three dimensions.

The case of coalescence with an external viscous ﬂuid is also studied in detail

both analytically and numerically. A signiﬁcantly diﬀerent structure is found

in which the outer ﬂuid forms a toroidal bubble of radius ∆ ∝ r3/2

m at the

meniscus and rm ∼ (tγ/4πη) ln[tγ/(ηR)]. This basic diﬀerence is due to the

presence of the outer ﬂuid viscosity, however small. With lengths scaled by

R a full description of the asymptotic ﬂow for rm(t) ≪ 1 involves matching

I. INTRODUCTION

Considerable interest has been devoted recently to the breakup of free-surface ﬂows into

drops under the action of surface tension (Rallison 1984; Stone 1994; Eggers 1997). Here we

investigate the complementary problem of surface-tension-driven coalescence of two drops,

which is of fundamental importance in understanding the possible topological transitions

in three-dimensional free-surface ﬂows. For example, numerical implementations of merging

(LaFaurie, Nardone, Scardovelli, Zaleski & Zanetti 1994) are based on phenomenological pre-

scriptions for joining the two surfaces, without a fundamental understanding or description

of the dynamics.

Traditional applications of coalescence ideas include the description of two-phase disper-

sions. As an important example, we mention phase separation in two-phase ﬂows (Niko-

layev, Beysens & Guenoun 1996; Bonnecaze, Martula & Lloyd 1998), where the velocity

ﬁeld induced by the merging of two drops entrains other drops, thus enhancing the rate of

coalescence. Another classical problem connected with drop coalescence is sintering, i.e. the

merging of a powder into a homogeneous material by heating. In many cases, in particular

that of ceramics or glasses, bulk ﬂuid motion is the dominant mechanism for coalescence

and the dynamical process is known as viscous sintering. In a classical paper, Frenkel (1945)

posed the problem of the merging of two spheres by slow ﬂuid motion as the ﬁrst step towards

understanding the properties of the material that results from sintering. For a diﬀerent case

in which surface diﬀusion is the dominant mechanism of mass transport, the asymptotics

of coalescence has recently been worked out (Eggers 1998), but such surface-dominated

transport is very diﬀerent from the bulk ﬂuid motion of interest here.

Much of the experimental and numerical work on coalescence in viscous systems is mo-

tivated by the viscous sintering problem. An exception is an experimental paper (Bradley

& Stow 1978) on the coalescence of water drops, but the low viscosity of water makes the

motion very rapid and diﬃcult to observe. On the other hand, by using a very high viscos-

ity ﬂuid, the motion can be slowed down as much as desired (Brinker & Scherer 1990) and

3

the experimental results agree very well with numerical simulations of the Stokes equations

(Martinez-Herrera & Derby 1995). The only theoretical analysis of three-dimensional coa-

lescence is the qualitative work by Frenkel (1945). Analytical solutions for two-dimensional

coalescence (i.e. of parallel cylinders) have been obtained using complex variable techniques

for the special case where the outer ﬂuid is perfectly inviscid or absent (Hopper 1990, 1992,

1993a,b; Richardson 1992). We show below that the three-dimensional problem has the

same asymptotic behaviour as this two-dimensional solution at early times. Our main aim,

however, is to address the more general case of coalescence with a viscous outer ﬂuid, for

which we ﬁnd that the structure of the solution near coalescence is quite diﬀerent from the

case of an inviscid exterior, though there is again a parallel between the two-dimensional

and three-dimensional problems.

Part of the challenge in treating three-dimensional coalescence arises from the fact that

it starts from a singular initial condition, shown in ﬁgure 1. We assume that the drops

are initially spherical, which is based on an underlying assumption of negligible velocity

of approach and hence negligible hydrodynamic deformation before contact. We imagine

that two such drops have just been joined along their symmetry axis by some microscopic

mechanism to form a tiny bridge of radius rm. Evidently, the “meniscus” around the bridge

will be a region of very high curvature, which drives the increase of rm with time. Our

main concerns will be the time dependence of rm for very early times, and the shape of the

interface and the ﬂow ﬁeld near the meniscus. We note that the ratio of the coeﬃcient of

surface tension γ and the viscosity η gives a ﬁxed velocity scale γ/η, and thus the expected

Reynolds number Re = ργrm/η2 will be be arbitrarily small as rm → 0, and the ﬂow will

initially be described by the Stokes equations regardless of the material parameters.

In the next section, we set up an integral representation of the Stokes ﬂow and split it

into two parts: an outer region far from the meniscus, in which the shape is still close to the

initial spherical condition, and an inner region near the meniscus in which the shape evolves

rapidly. The dominant contribution to the velocity ﬁeld comes from the high curvature of

the meniscus, and its amplitude is determined by the lengthscale ∆ of this curvature. The

4

main task is thus to ﬁnd the structure and scale of this inner solution. Since the inner

solution is determined by the local curvature and not the global shape, the results obtained

here are not restricted to the simple spherical geometry shown in ﬁgure 1. In section III we

show that only a negligible fraction of the ﬂuid caught in the narrow gap between the two

spheres is able to escape. The rest accumulates in a toroidal pocket, or bubble, of radius

rb ∝ r3/2

m that forms at the meniscus. This bubble is connected to a thin neck of width

rn ∝ r2

m. We have performed extensive simulations for the simplest case of equal viscosity

ﬂuids which conﬁrm these scaling laws.

In section IV we examine the inner “bubble” solution in greater detail. The bubble is

joined to the neck by a short region of very large curvature on a lengthscale that appears

numerically to be proportional to (rbrn)1/2 and thus tends to a corner as rn/rb → 0 (i.e.

rm → 0). Though the curvature of this corner is much greater than that of the bubble, both

contribute at the same order to the leading-order motion of the meniscus, which can be

thought of as simply due to a ring force of strength 2γ smeared over a lengthscale rb. In the

ﬁnal section we discuss the case of arbitrary viscosity ratios and mention related problems,

namely, the eﬀect of arbitrary initial shapes and the scaling at zero outer viscosity.

II. FROM THREE TO TWO DIMENSIONS

For simplicity we consider two initially spherical drops of equal radii R, as shown in

ﬁgure 1. Simple extensions to the cases of unequal radii and non-spherical shapes will be

described in Section V. We denote the viscosity of the drops by η and that of the outer ﬂuid

by λ−1η. As we have noted, the dynamics immediately after coalescence is described by the

Stokes equations. Since these equations are linear, the velocity ﬁeld can be expressed as an

integral of the driving surface forces γκn, where n is the normal directed into the outer ﬂuid

and κ = ∇.n is the curvature of the interface. We make the velocity dimensionless with

respect to γ/η, all lengths with respect to R, and times with respect to the corresponding

timescale τ = Rη/γ.

term on the right-hand side of (1) represents the driving by the surface forces, while the

second accounts for the diﬀerence in viscosity between the ﬂuids. The problem is closed by

requiring that any material marker ξ with position x1 on the surface moves according to

Equation (1) and the identity

∂tx1(ξ) = u(x1).

J.n dσ = 0,

ZS

(which is a consequence of the incompressibility condition ∇.J = 0) show that there would

be no ﬂow if κ were constant over S. It follows that, in the early stages of coalescence when

rm ≪ 1, the ﬂow is driven by the small region around the meniscus where κ is not close to

its initial constant value of 2. This key observation motivates an analysis based on splitting

the interface into two regions.

We use cylindrical polar coordinates (r, z) with origin at the junction between the drops.

Away from the region of coalescence, the surface is essentially undisturbed and thus has the

form h(z) = (2z)1/2 and h(z) = (−2z)1/2 for h ≪ 1 in z > 0 and z < 0, respectively. The

width of the gap between the spheres is given by

w = r2

(rm ≪ r ≪ 1).

(5)

and, since ∂w/∂r ≪ 1, the interfaces on either side of the gap are nearly parallel.

6

The solution for this outer region has to be matched with an inner solution on the scale

r = rm of the bridge or meniscus where the two drops are joined. The inner solution has

a region of very high curvature, which provides the dominant contribution to the velocity.

To a ﬁrst approximation, this region can be represented as a ring of radius rm and small

width ∆ connected to two asymptotically straight interfaces each pulling outward with unit

tension. The resultant eﬀect is that of a radially directed ring force with strength 2 per unit

length of the ring applied over a width ∆.

To ﬁnd the velocity ﬁeld generated by this ring, we try integrating over a circular line L

of forces f(r) = 2er. Considering, for the moment, only the simple case λ = 1, for which u

can be computed directly from (1), we have

From this representation it is evident that the force distribution cannot be represented by a

line everywhere as the ﬁrst term in the integral (6) would lead to a logarithmically inﬁnite

value of the velocity. In the neighborhood of rm, when |x2 − x1| = O(∆), one must account

for the fact that the force is distributed over a length scale of size ∆. The logarithmically

dominant part of the integral, which comes from ∆ ≪ |x2 − x1| ≪ rm, gives a radially

directed ﬂow

Since the curvature of the ring is not apparent at leading order in the region ∆ ≪

|x2 − x1| ≪ rm that dominates (7), we may equivalently consider the corresponding two-

dimensional problem, in which coordinates (x, y) take the place of (z, r). In that case (two

parallel cylindrical drops connected along a narrow band of width 2rm) the high-curvature

meniscus is represented by two straight lines a distance 2rm apart. Since the forces 2γ on the

lines pull in opposite directions, they cancel on scales much greater than their distance apart,

the integral (6) is cut oﬀ on the scale rm, and (7) again results. Because of this asymptotic

equivalence of the two-dimensional and axisymmetric problems, we will mostly consider the

7

two-dimensional problem from now on, which is simpler numerically. The two-dimensional

forms of the kernels J and K can be derived by integrating (2) along the third dimension to

obtain

and the surface integral (1) is now along the perimeter of the two-dimensional drops.

Not only does (7) give the leading-order velocity in both two and three dimensions, but

it also holds for all viscosity ratios λ. A summary of the argument is as follows. It is clear

that the early ﬂow can always be thought of as driven by ring or line forces of strength 2er or

2ey. Since Stokes ﬂow has no inertia, this force is transmitted unaltered across any surface

enclosing the bubble and, since the width of the gap between the spheres is asymptotically

negligible, the force must be supported by the internal ﬂuid, and the external ﬂuid in the

gap makes little diﬀerence. Now the logarithmically large velocity of a slender body moving

under a given force does not depend on the viscosity of the body, as can be seen explicitly

in the solution for the motion of a cylinder of one ﬂuid through another ﬂuid (Lister & Kerr

1989). Applying this result to the bubble at the meniscus, the ﬁnite viscosity of the external

ﬂuid in the bubble also makes little diﬀerence and (7) is correct at leading order for λ 6= 1

(though the higher-order corrections do depend on λ).

To evaluate the velocity from (7), however, it is necessary to determine the scale ∆ over

which the force is distributed at the meniscus and here the viscosity ratio does play a role.

In the following section we will show that ∆ ∝ rα

m, where α = 3/2 for ﬁnite λ and α = 3 for

the special case λ = ∞ (no outer ﬂuid). By integrating (7), we ﬁnd that

rm(t) ∼ −

t ln t.

(9)

Recalling that time is measured in units of ηR/γ, we see that the estimate based on di-

mensional analysis alone, rm ∝ tγ/η is not quite correct, and in fact requires a logarithmic

correction.

III. ASYMPTOTIC SHAPE OF THE MENISCUS

Using the equivalence of the two- and three-dimensional problems, we now study the

coalescence of two viscous circular cylinders in more detail. Figure 2 compares Hopper’s

exact solution for λ = ∞ with a numerical simulation for λ = 1 in which the initial condition

is that of a cusp with rm = 10−3, smoothed on the scale of r2

m. (The numerical method is

described in more detail below.) The shape of the meniscus for λ = ∞ is the tip of a near

cusp (Fig. 2a), while the shape for λ = 1 is observed to be quite diﬀerent for most of the

evolution (Fig. 2b): the external ﬂuid is collected in a small bubble at the meniscus, making

the lengthscale ∆ of the local solution much larger than in the absence of an external ﬂuid.

Only in the last stages of merging does the ﬂuid caught inside the bubble escape and the

results look qualitatively more like Hopper’s solution (Fig. 2c).

A. Analysis for an inviscid exterior

The existence of an exact two-dimensional solution for the special case λ = ∞ of an

inviscid or absent external ﬂuid (Hopper 1993a,b; Richardson 1992) allows us to test the

general ideas of section II. Asymptotic expansion of this solution near the meniscus shows

that

from which we deduce that the highly curved region is of size ∆ ∼ r3

m, and the curvature

κ scales like ∆−1 ∼ r−3

m . This result is somewhat surprising since ∆ is much smaller than

the gap width w ∼ r2

m estimated from the spherical shape of the outer solution and, at

present, we do not have an asymptotic argument for the appearance of the small scale r3
m.

(By contrast, with a viscous outer ﬂuid ∆ ∼ r3/2

m is larger than the gap width w, and this

scale can be understood from mass conservation as discussed in section III B.)

Inserting ∆ ∼ r3

m into (7), we obtain

(11)

for the velocity (v = ˙rm) at the meniscus, which agrees with the asymptotic result given by

Hopper (1993a); our earlier asymptotic analysis now allows the extension of this result to

three dimensions.

B. Analysis for a viscous exterior

For the case λ = 1 we begin by discussing the structure of the local solution close to

the meniscus, which is shown in ﬁgure 3. It consists of a “bubble” of outer ﬂuid of radius

∆ ≡ rb, which is connected to a thin neck of width rn. The neck matches onto the static

outer solution, so rn must scale like the gap width w ∼ r2

m. The area of the original gap up

to rm is O(r3

m) so that, if the meniscus advances faster than ﬂuid can escape from the gap,

the bubble should contain a ﬁnite fraction of the gap ﬂuid and hence rb ∝ r3/2
m .

To examine this argument in more detail, we consider the velocity ﬁeld generated by the

large curvature of the meniscus. As we have already noted, the ﬂow is driven by that part

of the interface where the interfacial curvature is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1 (or 2 in the

spherical case), namely |r − rm| = O(rb). Using a multipole expansion of this forcing, we

ﬁnd the velocity ﬁeld u(x1) at a distance |x1 − xm| ≫ rb from the center xm of the bubble

to be

u(x1) = f.J(x1 − xm),

at leading order, where J(r) is given by (8) and f is the total force exerted by the bubble.

This force is the integral of −κn = ∂st over the bubbles’ surface (Lb), where t is the tangent

vector pointing in the direction of increasing arclength s:

u(x1) = 2[J(x1 − xm) − J(x1 + xm)].ey

We are interested in the ﬂow in the neck, so we choose x1 = (0, y1) with y1 − rm ≫ rb.

From (8) and (14) we ﬁnd that the y-component of velocity in the neck is given by

un(y1) = −

2π

ln

y1 − rm

.

 

The representation (15) breaks down when y1 − rm = O(rb), since the higher-order terms in

the multipole expansion become of comparable magnitude and un(y1) crosses over to some

function that depends on the detailed structure of the bubble. Since (15) must match onto

the velocity ﬁeld in the bubble, we can write the velocity of the meniscus as

v = v0 +

2rm
rb (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where the constant v0 comes from the detailed shape of the bubble, and for λ = 1 is found

numerically to be v0 = −0.077. (This equation is consistent with (7), but also includes a

representation of the O(1) contribution.)

If rb ≪ y1 − rm ≪ rm then from (15) and (16)

Thus the ﬂuid in the neck ahead of the bubble only starts to move at a speed comparable to

that of the bubble when y1 − rm = O(rb) i.e. when the bubble has caught up with it. Thus

all the ﬂuid in the neck is collected into the advancing and growing bubble. Since the neck

width rn scales like r2

m, the total area of neck collected scales like ∼ r3

m, and thus

Finally, combining (18) with (16) or (9), we ﬁnd that

C. Numerical tests of scaling

To test the predictions of these scaling ideas, we have performed extensive two-

dimensional simulations of drop coalescence using the boundary-integral method. The initial

bridge has rm(0) = 10−6, which means the gap width is w = 10−12 initially. For simplicity,

we only considered the viscosity matched case λ = 1 so that the second term drops out from

(1) and u can be computed directly from the surface forces. The interface was parameterized

by arclength, and derivatives were evaluated using centered diﬀerences. The interface was

advanced according to (3), using an explicit second-order Runge-Kutta step. The diﬀerence

between the result of time step ∆t and two half-steps ∆t/2 was used to control the time

Improvement of the stability of our numerical method by making it implicit would be

computationally very demanding for an integral operator. Instead, we use a scheme ﬁrst

proposed by Douglas & Dupont (1971). The equation of motion (3) for the position of the

interface can be written at any given time as a linearization around the current interfacial

∂tx = A(x) · (x − x0) + constant

∂tδx = (A − B)δx + Bδx + constant

(21)

(22)

and treating the ﬁrst part explicitly, but the second part implicitly, the scheme becomes

unconditionally stable as long as |B| > |A|/2, where the matrix norm is deﬁned to be

the modulus of the largest eigenvalue (Douglas & Dupont 1971). In the present case, |A|

scales like (∆x)−1 up to logarithmic corrections, where ∆x is the minimum grid spacing.

By choosing B to be a diﬀusion operator multiplied by the local grid spacing, one can make

sure that the numerical method, although treating the integral operator explicitly, becomes

unconditionally stable. Without the help of this trick the time steps required to integrate

over the ﬁrst decade and a half in rm would have been prohibitively small.

12

To achieve the necessary spatial resolution, local reﬁnement of the mesh is crucial. The

resolution near the meniscus was set by the inverse of the local curvature. Away from

the inner solution, the grid spacing was allowed to taper oﬀ geometrically, with the spacing

constrained to change by no more than 10% from one grid point to the next. As explained in

more detail below, additional resolution was used in the transition region where the bubble

merges into the neck. The maximum number of points used to represent one quadrant of

the shape was about 900. Every few time steps a new grid was constructed using the current

interface, and the interface was interpolated to the new grid. Thus there was no need to

rearrange the grid points along the interface.

In ﬁgure 4 we show the scaling of the bubble radius rb and the minimum neck radius

rn and observe that both follow the predicted power laws (18). A closer inspection shows

that the slope of log rb is slightly smaller than expected, which is because the scaling of the

area of the bubble is almost the same as that of the neck. (The portion of the neck up

to the point y = rm + arb contributes an area An ≈ arbr2

m ∼ r7/2

m , which is only slightly

smaller than Ab ≈ r3

m since the two exponents are close.) We conﬁrmed numerically that

the rm-dependence of the total area A = Ab + An has no signiﬁcant deviation from r3

m, as

expected.

The scaling of the velocity at the meniscus (v) and in the neck (un) at position y1 =

rm + arb is shown in ﬁgure 5 (with a = 20) and compared with (1/2π) ln(2rm/rb), which

is predicted by equations (16) and (17) to have the same slope. The theory gives v − un=

constant = ln a/(2π) + v0 which is found numerically to be very close to 0.4 and hence

v0 = −0.077. All three curves in ﬁgure 5 should have a slope ln 10/4π when plotted against

log10(rm). The noticeable deviation comes from the fact that one is eﬀectively taking the

diﬀerence between log10 r3/2

m and log10 rm, so non-asymptotic eﬀects in rb, still present on

these small scales, become more pronounced.

It has been implicit in the previous arguments that the inner solution, consisting of a

bubble connected to a thin neck, has reached its asymptotic form: in the frame of reference of

the advancing bubble tip, and rescaled by the bubble radius, the shape should be stationary.

13

Figure 6, showing both the local interface proﬁle and the curvature at two values of rm one

decade apart, reveals that there is, in fact, a slow variation in part of the local proﬁle. This

slow variation is seen as a positive second peak in the curvature at the point where the

bubble meets the neck. To be able to resolve scales down to rm = 10−6, additional grid

points were inserted at the position of the second peak, where the grid spacing was based

on the width of the peak. As rm → 0, which corresponds to going back in time, the second

curvature peak increases and also gets narrower, as its integral must be ﬁnite to yield a ﬁnite

change of slope.

To obtain more information about the asymptotic shape of the inner solution and the

growth of the secondary peak in curvature, it is useful to consider the inner solution as a

separate problem. This analysis is given in the next section.

IV. BUBBLE ON A NECK

Here we study the local solution close to the meniscus, which consists of a bubble of

radius rb connected to a thin neck of width rn (see inset to ﬁgure 7). Asymptotically,

the curvature of the neck is very small compared with r−1

, so the neck can eﬀectively be

b

considered as an inﬁnitely long channel of uniform width. From now on, all lengths will be

measured in units of rb, so the radius of the bubble is normalized to unity, and the radius

of the neck asymptotes to some small number ǫ ≈ rn/rb. The solution we are interested in,

which corresponds to the asymptotic structure of the main solution described in Section III,

is such that the interfacial shape g(y, t) is advected at a constant speed vc without changing

its shape

satisfy

g(y, t) = G(y − vct).

(23)

The physical meaning of this statement is that in the original problem the local solution

relaxes to a quasi-steady shape on a much shorter timescale than the position rm of the

meniscus is changing. The velocity ﬁeld of the local steadily translating shape (23) must

14

(uy − vc)G′ = ux.

(24)

The boundary condition is that g(y) approaches ǫ as y → ∞. The components of the velocity

ﬁeld ux and uy follow from the integral equation (1) as usual. Instead of solving the system

(1) and (24) directly, we found it most convenient to evolve two bubbles attached to a very

long, straight neck of radius ǫinit until a stationary shape is established, as shown in the

inset to ﬁgure 7. The tension in the neck is responsible for pulling the bubble along. The

neck shortens during the relaxation and the radius increases to a value ǫ, which then only

changes very slowly by the time a stationary shape is reached.

Since the radius of the bubble rb and the radius of the neck rn are very diﬀerent, one

might think that the curvature distribution within the bubble is independent of the neck

radius ǫ. However, the limit ǫ → 0 turns out to be singular as an increasingly pronounced

peak of positive curvature appears at the junction between bubble and neck, as demonstrated

in ﬁgure 6.

First, in ﬁgure 7 we compare the curvature distribution as given in ﬁgure 6 for rm = 10−3.5

with that of the stationary problem, equations (1) and (24), with ǫ = rn/rb. We choose ǫinit

such that the neck has the appropriate width ǫ by the time a stationary shape is reached.

The excellent agreement shows that the ﬂow close to the meniscus is completely equivalent to

the translating bubble, which is of course a much simpler problem. Hence the inner solution

of the coalescence problem can be understood completely in terms of the translating bubble.

Figure 8(a) shows a sequence of bubble shapes for increasingly small values of ǫ. The

overall shape of the bubble does not depend very much on ǫ, and it looks as if the shapes are

almost the same for the two smallest values. However there is an increasingly sharp “corner”

at the point where the neck meets the bubble. This result is most evident from a plot of

the curvature for the same values of ǫ; see ﬁgure 8(b). While the curvature of the bubble

is negative, the corner at the junction between the bubble and the neck corresponds to a

growing peak of positive curvature. In ﬁgure 8(b) we also include a plot of the maximum of

this peak as a function of ǫ. The data is suggestive of κ−1 ∼ ǫ1/2 though it is hard to make

15

a deﬁnite statement. If this is so then the lengthscale of the corner is the geometric mean

of the scales of the bubble and the neck, which would be r7/4

m in the coalescence problem.

From (13) it is evident that the total force exerted by the peak is equal to the change in

slope. As can be seen from ﬁgure 8 (a) the change is constant to a good approximation so

that, of the total force 2ey exerted by the bubble, roughly 15% is exerted by the corner and

85% by the rest of the bubble.

V. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK

As we have demonstrated, even the simplest case of viscosity-matched ﬂuids represents a

problem of enormous complexity, in which there are features on at least the lengthscales r2
m,

r3/2
m , rm and 1. Therefore, we conﬁned ourselves to computing the leading-order asymptotics,

which we note are only logarithmically dominant.

In all likelihood, quantities like the

bubble radius rb(t) contain additional logarithmic terms, whose calculation require a better

knowledge of the matched asymptotics of the problem. Further complications arise because

the inner solution is itself singular, with a corner of lengthscale which we estimate to be

O(r7/4

m ). Important goals for future work would be conﬁrmation of the inner scalings, formal

asymptotic matching of the diﬀerent scales, and to go beyond the leading-order problem.

Another important problem is the generalization of our calculations to arbitrary viscosity

ratios λ. A major obstacle to developing a quantitative theory for general λ is that numerical

simulations are much more diﬃcult. When λ 6= 1 (1) is a second-kind integral equation for

u, which requires an order N 3 eﬀort to solve instead of N 2. Moreover, for small rm the

matrix associated with the second integral becomes singular since the local solution for the

velocity ﬁeld is close to a uniform translation for which the kernel has a zero eigenvalue. We

have not yet found a way to treat this singularity suﬃciently well to go beyond rm-values of

10−2 for λ 6= 1.

We have argued already that we expect the leading-order behaviour of ˙rm to be given

by (7) for any λ since the net force from the meniscus is supported asymptotically by the

16

internal ﬂuid. We also believe that the scaling ∆ ∼ r3/2

m will hold as rm → 0 for any ﬁnite λ

since, even for large λ (small external viscosity), the pressure drop along a narrow channel

is large and so the outer ﬂuid is not able to escape from the gap and is caught in a bubble.

Expressed diﬀerently, the positive curvature at the bubble corner is unable to pull the walls

of the channel apart since this would require signiﬁcant motion along the channel.

It is

intriguing that Hopper’s exact solution shows that the situation is very diﬀerent for λ = ∞

when there is no external viscous resistance to overcome and no bubble forms (ﬁgure 2a).

Thus the limits λ → ∞ and rm → 0 do not commute, reﬂecting the fact that one must be

careful in assuming a zero-stress condition in situations involving narrow cusps, as even a

very small external viscosity can be signiﬁcant.

We can provide a physical estimate for the scale below which a bubble forms for λ ≫ 1.

Fluid motion in the narrow gap may be treated with the lubrication approximation, whence

ηun/(λr2

n) ≈ ∆p/rm and ∆p ≈ γ/rb gives the estimate un ≈ (λγ/η)(rm/R)3/2. Therefore, a

bubble can only be expected to form when the meniscus motion v ≈ γ/η > un, which occurs

on an approximate lengthscale rm/R < λ−2/3.

We have been considering the simplest case of equal spheres brought into contact. The

case of unequal spheres of radii R and R/δ, with δ < 1 is a straightforward generalization

in which the gap thickness (5) is simply replaced by

w = r2(1 + δ)/2

(rm ≪ r ≪ 1).

(25)

Similar considerations show that the initial evolution of axisymmetric drops brought into

contact along their symmetry axes depends only on the local curvature at the initial contact.

An more interesting variation is that of general initial shapes for which the locus of high

curvature (in three dimensions) near contact no longer forms a circle, but is a more general

closed curve. To leading order, this curve is convected with a logarithmically large velocity

ﬁeld, pointing in the direction normal to the curve.

Recent research (Nikolayev et al. 1996; Bonnecaze et al. 1998) has suggested that the

rate of coalescence in emulsions can be greatly enhanced by the ﬂow generated by individual

17

coalescence events. Our analysis suggests that an appropriate model for the far-ﬁeld velocity

of a single coalescence event is the Stokes ﬂow driven by an expanding ring force of radius

rm and strength 2γ per unit length. This dipolar ﬂow, which may be obtained by solving

η∇2u − ∇p + 2γδ(r − rm)δ(z)er = 0

(26)

using Hankel transforms [22], is

ur(r, z) =

J1(kr)J1(krm)(1 − kz)e−kzdk

(r2 + z2)5/2 [rer + zez] ,

(28)

which is shown in ﬁgure 9 superimposed on the outlines of two spherical bubbles. The

coalescence-induced radially directed force drives a ﬂow towards the two drops over an angle

≈ 127◦. The ﬂow (28) might be used for simplicity in models of multiple coalescence.

All motions described so far begin with a local point contact and it is worth considering

how this contact might be achieved. The near-contact squeezing motion generated when two

drops (or a drop and a plane) are in relative motion can be analyzed using the lubrication

approximation (e.g. Jones & Wilson 1978; Yiantsos & Davis 1991). Owing to the large

pressures accompanying ﬂow along the narrow gap, the surface tends to deform in the

narrow gap. In particular, when two equal size drops are squeezed together with a force F

on each drop, then a dimple tends to form when h0(t) < R/λ2, where h0(t) is the minimum

gap spacing and R the radius of curvature of the undeformed drop. The magnitude of the

deformation becomes the same order of magnitude as the gap height and the dimple has

a radial scale (F R/γ)1/2. Away from the gap the drop is nearly spherical so long as, for

λ = O(1), the eﬀective capillary number is small, O(F h1/2

0 /γR3/2) ≪ 1. An implication of

18

these analyses is that contact is very likely to occur along a rim, or at least at an oﬀ-axis

position, with an initial radius of the bridge of order (F R/γ)1/2. The dynamics would then

follow the results shown in Section III.

From an experimental point of view, it is probably not relevant to investigate smaller

(dimensionless) rm than 10−5 since the gap width just ahead of the bubble is proportional to

r2
m, which is then of microscopic size for reasonable values of R. Very small inhomogeneities

in the ﬂuid or van der Waals attractions will cause the two interfaces to reconnect, and to

create an instability that breaks the azimuthal symmetry we have assumed in the three-

dimensional problem. Moreover, the bubble actually forms a structure that resembles a long

thin torus in three dimensions, and is thus prone to a Rayleigh capillary instability, which

grows on a short timescale proportional to rb and is potentially dangerous. On the other

hand, there are stabilizing eﬀects since the bubble is also convected (Brenner, Shi & Nagel

1994), and a careful nonlinear stability analysis has to be done to determine the scale where

the stability is ﬁrst expected to occur. This question is experimentally relevant because it

sets the size of small bubbles of the outer ﬂuid that may be observed after coalescence.

We have pointed out that coalescence is initially described by the Stokes equations. If

the viscosity of the ﬂuid is small, this is true only for the early stages of coalescence, until

the Reynolds number is of order one, which happens when

rm ≈ ℓ,

ℓ = η2/(ργ).

(29)

For water, ℓ = 1.4×10−6 cm , so it is a very relevant question to go beyond the Stokes approx-

imation. After passing the transition region (29) we expect the dynamics to be described by

the Euler equations. Assuming that the scale of the local solution at the meniscus is set by

the gap width alone, the interfacial stress driving this motion is approximately γ/(r2

m/R),

which is to be the same magnitude as ρv2. Hence, with v = ˙rm, we ﬁnd

rm ∝

1/4

γR
ρ !

 

t1/2,

(30)

which corresponds to v ∝ t−1/2. The geometrical part of both problems is similar to the

Stokes case, but the coupling between pressure and velocity makes the relationship between

19

the surface shape and the velocity diﬀerent, so an alternative treatment is needed to predict

the numerical coeﬃcient in front of the power law for rm.

Clearly, the possibility of ﬁnite Reynolds number, arbitrary surface shape, ﬁnite velocity

of approach, and the inclusion of another ﬂuid outside the drops lends a tremendous richness

to the class of singularities studied here.

the axis of symmetry z = 0 lies at the initial point of contact. The bridge joining the two spheres

FIGURES

has radius rm and width ∆.

FIG. 2. A closeup of the point of contact during coalescence of two identical cylinders for

the two cases of no outer ﬂuid (λ = ∞) and two ﬂuids of equal viscosity (λ = 1). (a) is Hopper’s

solution for rm = 10−3, 10−2.5, 10−2, and 10−1.5. (b) a numerical simulation of the viscosity matched

case that shows ﬂuid collecting in a bubble at the meniscus. Note that the two axes are scaled

diﬀerently, so the bubble is almost circular. For large values of rm, as shown in (c), the ﬂuid ﬁnally

escapes from the bubble, and the width of the meniscus is closer to the value of the gap width

O(r2

m).

FIG. 3.

The structure of the local solution close to the meniscus.

It resembles a bubble

connected to a thin neck. The radius of the bubble is rb and the minimum radius of the neck is rn.

The distance from the origin to the front of the bubble is rm, which is not drawn to scale here.

FIG. 4. Scaling of the bubble radius rb and the neck radius rn as function of rm.

FIG. 5.

Scaling of the velocity v at the tip and the velocity un at a position y = rm + 20rb

in the neck. There is a constant diﬀerence of 0.4 between the two. Both agree very well with

the scaling of (1/2π) ln(2rm/rb) as predicted by theory. For comparison, we also give a slope of

(ln 10)/4π = 0.183.

FIG. 6. The local solution and its curvature distribution in coordinates rescaled by rb. As rm

gets smaller, a sharp peak develops at the junction between the bubble and the neck.

FIG. 7. A comparison of the curvature distribution of the local solution for rm = 10−3.5 and

the stationary “bubble on a neck”. The peak height of the positive curvature has been used to

match the two. In an inset, we show the initial condition used to compute the stationary shape of

the translating bubble.

(a) The stationary state of a translating bubble, pulled by a thin neck for diﬀerent

values of − log10 ǫ = 1.8, 2.8, 3.7, and 4.9. (b) Blowup of the curvature distribution. Although

the surface shape seems to have converged, the maximum negative curvature in the junction still

increases. The insets show the scaling of the maximum curvature κmax and that of κmax ∗ w1/2,

where w1/2 is the half-width measured in arclength.

FIG. 9. The velocity ﬁeld generated by an expanding ring of forces in the limit of the radius

of the ring rm going to zero. Note that the velocity ﬁeld is pointing outward in the direction of

the expanding ring, but is inwardly directed over much of the ﬂow domain.

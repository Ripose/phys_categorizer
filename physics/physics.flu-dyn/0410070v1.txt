The 3D structure of the Lagrangian acceleration in turbulent ﬂows

We report experimental results on the three dimensional Lagrangian acceleration in highly turbu-
lent ﬂows. Tracer particles are tracked optically using four silicon strip detectors from high energy
physics that provide high temporal and spatial resolution. The components of the acceleration are
shown to be statistically dependent. The probability density function (PDF) of the acceleration
magnitude is comparable to a log-normal distribution. Assuming isotropy, a log-normal distribution
of the magnitude can account for the observed dependency of the components. The time dynamics
of the acceleration components is found to be typical of the dissipation scales whereas the magnitude
evolves over longer times, possibly close to the integral time scale.

The Lagrangian approach has been fruitful in advanc-
ing of the understanding of the anomalous statistical
properties of turbulent ﬂows [1]. Lagrangian experimen-
tal studies lagged behind theory because both high spa-
tial and high temporal resolution are required for La-
grangian measurements.
It has been possible only re-
cently to obtain well resolved measurements (e.g. [2, 3, 4,
5, 6]). These experiments raised a renewed theoretical in-
terest in the Lagrangian approach. For example, anoma-
lous scaling properties may be related to non-extensive
statistical mechanics [7, 8]. Recently, reﬁned stochastic
models have been proposed to reproduce the observed
intermittency of turbulence [9, 10]. However, there re-
mains a lack of experimental data to confront theory and
models. At Cornell University, we have developed a high
speed three dimensional (3D) imaging system to study
the statistics and dynamics of tracer particles. Here, we
report data on the 3D structure of acceleration, the cor-
relations between the acceleration components, and the
statistics of the acceleration magnitude. We show that
the acceleration magnitude probability density function
(PDF) can be described by a log-normal distribution. As-
suming isotropy, the shape of the acceleration component
PDF can be derived. The dynamical diﬀerence between
the components and the magnitude is discussed.

The ﬂow and the detectors have been described in de-
tail in a previous article [5]. The ﬂow was of the Von
K´arm´an type, driven by two coaxial disks with blades
and rim, 20 cm in diameter, 33 cm apart. The water was
enclosed in a cylindrical tank with a diameter of 48.3 cm.
The disks were rotated at the same angular velocity but
in opposite sense.

and thus yielded only 1D or 2D tracks [5]). Each detector
was made of 512 strips (pixels) and recorded one com-
ponent of the position. The particles were polystyrene
spheres, 25 µm in diameter, with density 1.06 times that

was then imaged at a 45

of the particle motion in the ﬂow. The characteristics of the
optics were identical to those in [5]. The rotation axis of the
disks was along the z direction.

of water. They were shown to behave as neutral tracer
particles [5].

Since each detector recorded only one coordinate, the
four recordings had to be matched to build a 3D track.
The algorithm used to process the raw data has already
been described in [5]. For each pair of detectors ((x, z)
or (y, z)), the intensity scattered by the particles as they
moved through the laser beam was highly correlated. The
intensity signal was used to match the x and z coordi-
nates or the y and z coordinates in each pair. The last
step consisted of matching the two recordings of the z
component to get the full 3D trajectory. To compute the
acceleration from the tracks, the position signal was con-
volved with a Gaussian kernel that both diﬀerentiated

record, for the ﬁrst time, large data sets of resolved 3D
acceleration in highly turbulent ﬂows.

STATISTICS OF THE ACCELERATION VECTOR

The insert of Fig. 2 shows the normalized PDFs of
the three acceleration components for Rλ = 690. The
three curves collapse showing that the shape of the PDF
is the same for all directions. Nevertheless, the acceler-
ation is not isotropic as the variances of the axial and
transverse components are diﬀerent. The ratio of axial
to transverse acceleration variance decreases from 1.17 at
Rλ = 285 to 1.06 at Rλ = 690 [5]. As can be seen from
Fig. 2, the tails of the PDF are increasingly wide as the
Reynolds numbers grows. This conﬁrms the results pre-
viously reported in [5]. The tails are very wide, meaning
that the Lagrangian acceleration is a very intermittent
quantity. The ﬂatness was quite hard to estimate:
its
very high value required large data sets and the presence
of noise made the estimation diﬃcult [6, 8]. Here we
took advantage of the two simultaneous recordings of the
z component, giving two independent realizations of the
noise. In this way we got a new estimation of the value
of the ﬂatness, less sensitive to the noise. For the high-
est Reynolds number measured, the ﬂatness was slightly
over 100.

Most stochastic models for Lagrangian dispersion in
isotropic and homogeneous turbulence are one dimen-
sional and model the three components of acceleration
independently (e.g. [11]).
In reality, the shape of the
PDF of the components implies that the components are

is 1 for independent variables. This quantity is shown
in Fig. 3(b). The joint probability of simultaneously ob-
serving two components taking high absolute values is
higher than the product of the probabilities by more than
three orders of magnitude. On the contrary, it is much
less probable to observe one component taking a small
value and another a large absolute value. The simulta-
neous occurrence of large values of diﬀerent acceleration
components is in agreement with previous observations
of Mordant et al. in the inertial range [12].

Our unique setup enables us to make the ﬁrst ex-
perimental estimation of the acceleration magnitude at
high Reynolds numbers. The insert in Fig. 5 presents
the distribution of the logarithm of the magnitude at
Rλ = 690. The experimental PDF of log
resembles
the one of Fig. 19 from [13] obtained from DNS at much
lower Reynolds number (Rλ = 90). The experimental
curves are compared to a log-normal distribution,

a

with s = 1 (dashed line). As can be seen in the inset
of Fig. 5, at large values of the acceleration, the curve is
very close to the log-normal distribution while for low val-
ues it displays a wider tail than the log-normal, possibly
exponential. However, the departure from log-normal at
low values occurs for values of the acceleration which are
much smaller than the average acceleration magnitude.
Small values of acceleration are highly sensitive to ex-
perimental noise. Indeed, a synthetic acceleration vector
drawn from a genuine lognormal magnitude shows such
a tail as soon as it is corrupted by noise. Thus this tail
may not be representative of the real PDF.

Figure 5 displays the PDF of the acceleration magni-
tude for three Reynolds numbers. Despite the low statis-
tics, at Rλ = 285 it seems that the PDF decreases a little
faster for large accelerations than in the two other data
sets. For the two higher Reynolds numbers, the shape
does not seem to evolve and the two curves are super-
imposed. All three curves compare well to a lognormal

3

distribution of unit variance for normalized values lower
than 25.

Now let us assume that the distribution of the accel-
eration magnitude is indeed log-normal, and that the ac-
celeration vector is isotropic (an assumption which seems
to be valid at the highest Reynolds numbers). Then one
can compute the functional form of the acceleration com-
ponents by

The parameter m accounts only for the change in the
3/e2s2 for variance 1). The
component variance (m =
s parameter determines the shape of the PDF. For the
p
highest Reynolds numbers, the value s = 1 gives very
good agreement with the experimental PDFs of the ac-
up to 25 times
celeration components for values of
the standard deviation (Fig. 2, solid line). For the high-
est values of the acceleration component, we observe a
departure of the experimental curve from the log-normal
behavior. The origin of this departure remains unclear.
It could be due to a real hydrodynamic eﬀect, but may
also be an artifact of the measurement process; for in-
stance, the particles may not follow the very high accel-
eration events and thus underestimate the extreme tails.
The rather low statistics at the highest values of acceler-
ation can also be responsible for the departure

in Fig. 4 (solid line). The agreement with the data is very
good up to ten times the rms value of the acceleration
component. For higher values, the data is lower than
the log-normal result. Nevertheless, the log-normal curve
remains close to the data, showing that the log-normal
distribution of variance one seems to describe the data
for moderate values of the acceleration.

zero within the experimental uncertainty. The autocor-
relations are very close to each other. Small diﬀerences
are nevertheless observed, in particular between the hor-
izontal (x, y) components and the vertical one (z). The
auto-covariance of az reaches zero at 2.2 τη (comparable
to the values reported for DNS at low Rλ in [13, 15])
and the other two components at 3.0 τη. We observed
that the crossing times are almost independent of the
Reynolds number.

Figure 6 also displays the autocorrelation of the accel-
eration magnitude (solid line). The decrease of the co-
variance of the magnitude is seen to be much slower than
the component correlation (the size of the measurement
volume does not allow us to observe the full decrease of
the magnitude covariance). This feature was observed
in DNS at low Reynolds number by Yeung [13, 15] and
for velocity increments by Mordant et al. [12]. At large
τ , a bias due to the ﬁnite measurement volume is ex-
pected to depress the autocorrelation [6]. This bias will
strongly aﬀect the autocorrelation of the magnitude since
it decays very slowly. Nevertheless, one can extrapolate
the decrease in order to obtain an estimate of the char-
acteristic time (Fig. 6). We found a zero crossing time
of 40τη, which is most likely underestimated because of
the bias. This time is one seventh of the rotation pe-
riod of the disks. Mordant et al. reported, for velocity
increments, times that are close to one third of the ro-
tation period [12, 16]. The dynamics of the acceleration
magnitude was observed to have time scales comparable
to those of the energy injection. A similar result was ob-

4

served by Pope for low Reynolds number simulations [17].
This observation is quite striking as the components have
been observed to evolve at the dissipation time scale as
expected in the framework of the Kolmogorov 1941 the-
ory.

In summary, we have provided experimental evidence
of the complex structure of the Lagrangian acceleration.
The three components of the acceleration are not inde-
pendent as in most stochastic models. We observed that
the PDF of the acceleration magnitude is close to a log-
normal distribution. Assuming isotropy, we showed that
a log-normal distribution reproduces fairly accurately the
experimental observations, including the dependence of
the components. The acceleration also displays a rich
dynamics with two diﬀerent time scales of correlation: a
short time for the direction and a longer one for the mag-
nitude. Intense vortices are objects that ﬁt well with the
previous observations. They can account for the strong
intermittency of the acceleration components. They in-
duce simultaneous high accelerations in diﬀerent com-
ponents.
If their lifetime is long enough, they can be
responsible for the two time scales, since the magnitude
of the acceleration remaining unchanged for times much
longer than the vortex rotation rate.

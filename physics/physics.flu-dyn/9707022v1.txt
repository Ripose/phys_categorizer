Introduction

Buoyancy is responsible for the formation of many important geophysical and astrophysical

ﬂows. In a rotating system, a sustained source of positive or negative buoyancy may give

rise to an extended horizontal current against a lateral boundary, a gravity current. In such

a current, the Coriolis force associated with the horizontal ﬂow in the current is balanced

by an oﬀshore pressure gradient supported by the wall. The resulting ﬂow is then bounded

by a solid boundary on the right, (looking along the direction of ﬂow in the Northern

hemisphere) and by a front on the left. If the wall is sloping rather than purely vertical,

the component of the Coriolis force parallel to the wall in the vertical plane can balance

the similar component of the gravitational force acting on the current. Where the source is

persistent, such currents can reach states of quasi-equilibrium. See Griﬃths 1 for a review

of boundary gravity currents.

It has been noted that the instability of many varieties of sheared ﬂows cannot

be determined locally 2. As an illustrative example, recall that for a two-dimensional

incompressible shear ﬂow, U = U(y), one must use boundary conditions appropriate to the

corresponding eigenvalue problem in order to obtain a necessary condition for instability.

That condition is simply the vanishing of the vorticity gradient (Uyy = 0) somewhere in the

– 2 –

ﬂow – the celebrated Rayleigh criterion. Local approximation leads to a diﬀerent condition

and the erroneous prediction of likely instability 3.

Investigation of more complicated (compressible) 2-D shear ﬂows has conﬁrmed

the nonlocality of wave-interaction, or resonant, instabilities 4 and more speciﬁc studies

of boundary current conﬁgurations which account for the coupling of the current to

its environment have also found that mode resonances can alter the intrinsic stability

characteristics of ﬂows 5,6,7.

2. The Meddy problem

How can the presence of warm, salty Mediterranean water be explained when it is found in

the Western Atlantic ocean? The Mediterranean water is delivered in compact lens-shaped

vortices aﬀectionately known as Meddies. Such long-range mixing capabilities of some

currents has a profound inﬂuence on the global ocean circulation. This example poses two

distinct questions:

1 How are Meddies formed?

2 How do they subsequently propagate ?

The propagation of coherent patches of vorticity is only partially understood. A

number of diﬀerent long-range mechanisms can aﬀect the motion of vortices. These

include: interactions between diﬀerent vortices, advection by a large scale background ﬂow,

interaction with a background vorticity or potential vorticity gradient (a good example of

this is the “planetary beta” eﬀect seen in ﬂows in a thin shell of ﬂuid on the surface of a

rotating spherical planet 8), interaction of a vortex with a horizontal or vertical boundary,

– 3 –

small scale dissipation within and around a vortex, and MHD eﬀects in examples of

astrophysical vortices.

3. Laboratory experiments

To investigate question 1, we developed a series of laboratory experiments to study

buoyancy-driven currents in rotating stratiﬁed environments. Although we have targeted a

speciﬁc oceanographic ﬂow to model, it is tantalizing to consider that a reduced problem

such as the one we propose here may also be relevant to other problems. In binary star

systems, to consider one possible example, infall material from one star can feed an accretion

disk around the other; the subsequent equilibration of the new material may well lead to

buoyancy driven currents of a similar nature. But this study is primarily a model for the

Mediterranean outﬂow, where we have the beneﬁt of comparison with direct observations.

The two principal goals of the experiment were:

(a) to determine the structure (velocity shear and thickness) of the currents initially

formed from a negatively buoyant inﬂow

(b) to examine the stability properties of these current

A diagram of he experimental apparatus is shown in ﬁgure 1. The interface of the stable

ambient two-layer stratiﬁcation intersects the surface of a conical section at mid-depth.

A thymol blue solution of intermediate density is held outside the tank and also ﬁlls a

reservoir at the tank’s outer edge. The densities of the overﬂow water (ρ2) and the bottom

layer (ρ3) were achieved by dissolving sugar in distilled water.

A current is initiated by establishing a ﬂow that causes overﬂow in the reservoir and

the subsequent buoyant descent of the overﬂow water down the sloping surface toward the

– 4 –

layer interface, where it becomes neutrally buoyant. Because of the rotation, the descending

current turns to ﬂow cyclonically along the topographic slope. Except for extreme initial

conditions, the current will still reach the layer interface. Along one radius of the conical

surface, an array of ﬁne (0.006” diameter) vertical wires are placed at 0.44 cm intervals.

The wires are pulsed with an electrical current to activate thymol blue tracer in ﬂuid of

the current, allowing direct visualization. A camera is positioned above the tank (where

the length of advected tracer is used to determine velocities) and a mirror is oriented to

allow a head-on view of the current (where the height of unadvected tracer determines

local thickness). Crude evaluation of the response in the ambient layers is done by tracking

ﬂoating and, where possible, submerged tracers. Images captured with the CCD camera

were digitally stored using a video framer and the measurement of tracer was facilitated by

enhancing contrast using standard algorithms. Pre-marked intervals on the experimental

surfaces provided accurate distance standards, and the real-time record kept on video

simpliﬁed measurement of time intervals.

Figure 1. The experimental apparatus: the cylindrical tank and the submerged conic slope

are shown in cross-section; the tank has diameter of ∼ 60 cm. Everything sits on a rotating

table.

In all experiments, the densities were prepared with the values: ρ1 = 1.0g/cc,

ρ2 = 1.005g/cc, and ρ3 = 1.01g/cc; the depths of the ambient layers were 11cm each. The
reduced gravity between layers then took the values: g′

23 = 5.0g cm/sec2; while Ω

12 = g′

was either 1. or 1.5. The principal control value was the volume ﬂux, S, of ρ2-ﬂuid, which

was varied from 0.15 − 1.0cc/sec. S is directly related to a characteristic current depth

H, which varied from 1 − 3cm. Two values of the topographic slope, α, were used, 0.0 (a

– 6 –

vertical wall) and 0.25.

From the parameters above, we can construct several useful quantities. A Rossby

deformation length is given by LD = (g′H)

1

2 /2Ω, and the ratio of the current width to LD is

indicative of the relative importance of baroclinic and barotropic disturbances. A Reynolds

number is given by Re = (g′H 3/ν2)

1

2 , and for these experiments reached nearly 103, but a

more useful quantity is the Froude number F = U 2/(g′H).

These and other experiments have veriﬁed that baroclinic currents and instabilities of

interest are characterized not so much by Re as by F . In oceanic ﬂows, F can vary between

10−2 and 102, and in the laboratory we can easily produce a range of F between 10−2 and

10, simply by forming velocities U in the range 0.1 to 1 cm/sec.

In high Reynolds number ﬂows without ambient stratiﬁcation, experiments have shown

that instabilities of Kelvin-Helmholtz type typically grow rapidly at the nose, while further

upstream – where the steady current is well established – baroclinic instabilities produce

eddies. We focus on the established current rather than its nose and the details of the

intrusion process. For this reason, we initiate the current with a small density enhancement

to minimize the initial Kelvin-Helmholtz mixing, while using a tank of suﬃcient horizontal

dimension to traverse the relevant Froude number range.

4. Steady three layer currents

What is the three-layer, steady, streamwise uniform solution? An arbitrary three layer

arrangement of ﬂuid is described by the familiar shallow layer system:

+ f × u1 = −g∇(h1 + h2 + h3) ,

+ f × u2 = −g

∇h1 − g∇(h2 + h3) ,

We will let Ox be the streamwise direction, parallel to the boundary, and Oy, the

cross-stream direction. For a boundary current of intermediate density (i = 2) ﬂowing

against a vertical wall, a steady, streamwise uniform current with velocity ¯u(y) and thickness

¯h(y) must satisfy potential vorticity and momentum conservation.:

For uniform non-zero initial potential vorticity, Q2(t = 0) = Q∗, we ﬁnd currents of width

To extend the solutions above to the laboratory conﬁguration, in which the boundary

along which the current ﬂows has some slope, we must simply match the solution above to

a two layer solution of a current ﬂowing along a slope (this sub-problem is the subject of

several previous studies, see the review 1 for references).

5. Results

– 8 –

Steady solutions are shown in ﬁgure 2 alongside measured proﬁles. Experiments performed

with vertical boundaries have found the strong tendency of currents to be unstable, even

when the currents were initiated from a uniform potential vorticity source. This instability

set in uniformly along the current once it became suﬃciently wide, forming a chain of

eddies. The eddies were roughly the same width as the current and moved irregularly

following separation.

thickness for three experiments, one case conincides with the shedding of a cyclone.

Analogous experiments along sloping boundaries have found the currents to be stable

over much longer times and for wider currents. The stabilization of such currents by the

presence of a slope should be emphasized – it suggests that the instabilities found for

highly idealized and often symmetrical posed problems may not be realized in more general

settings. The ﬁrst step in proving or disproving this hypothesis is understanding the steady

– 9 –

current conﬁgurations and a subsequent stability analysis. What we have reported here are

ﬁrst measurements of steady current proﬁles for these stable cases.

Related experiments, in which a surface current is allowed to eventually encounter a

sloping boundary, have also found that a slope can have a stablizing eﬀect – following the

encounter, the current was found to be slower, wider, and more laminar than it would be

along a vertical wall9.

A ﬁnal point concerns the formation of Meddies:

in the process of initiating

experimental currents, the intermediate density ﬂuid formed two distinct equilibria. The

ﬁrst as it ﬂowed through less dense water, down the slope and to the right; after reaching the

layer interface with the densest water, it spread to the right and along the sloping boundary.

Both stages were rather laminar and steady, but at the transition, a single large cyclone

was typically shed. The Mediterranean undergoes a similar transition where it negotiates

a sharp turn at Cape St. Vincent and presumably other signiﬁcant topographic variations,

such as channels, are also encountered. The role of such localized perturbations may help

explain why, when experimental currents suggest stability, their oceanic counterparts are

able to form eddies.

The excitation of inertial waves in the ambient homogeneous ﬂuid is also found.

Finally, we would like to use these preliminary results to initiate a more thorough

investigation of the linear instability in the full three layer problem as well as the basis for

a companion set of numerical experiments to duplicate those done in the laboratory.

The motion of ﬂuid particles as they are pushed
along erratic trajectories by ﬂuctuating pressure gra-
dients is fundamental to transport and mixing in tur-
bulence. It is essential in cloud formation and atmo-
spheric transport[1, 2], processes in stirred chemical
reactors and combustion systems[3], and in the indus-
trial production of nanoparticles[4]. The perspective
of particle trajectories has been used successfully to
describe mixing and transport in turbulence[3, 5], but
issues of fundamental importance remain unresolved.
One such issue is the Heisenberg-Yaglom prediction
of ﬂuid particle accelerations[6, 7], based on the 1941
scaling theory of Kolmogorov[8, 9] (K41). Here we
report acceleration measurements using a detector
adapted from high-energy physics to track particles
in a laboratory water ﬂow at Reynolds numbers up to
63,000. We ﬁnd that universal K41 scaling of the accel-
eration variance is attained at high Reynolds numbers.
Our data show strong intermittency—particles are ob-
served with accelerations of up to 1,500 times the ac-
celeration of gravity (40 times the root mean square
value). Finally, we ﬁnd that accelerations manifest the
anisotropy of the large scale ﬂow at all Reynolds num-
bers studied.

In principle, ﬂuid particle trajectories are easily mea-
sured by seeding a turbulent ﬂow with minute tracer par-
ticles and following their motions with an imaging sys-
tem. In practice this can be a very challenging task since
we must fully resolve particle motions which take place
on times scales of the order of the Kolmogorov time,
τη = (ν/ǫ)1/2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity and ǫ
is the turbulent energy dissipation. This is exempliﬁed in
Fig. 1, which shows a measured three-dimensional, time

resolved trajectory of a tracer particle undergoing vio-
lent accelerations in our turbulent water ﬂow, for which
τη = 0.3 ms. The particle enters the detection volume on
the upper right, is pushed to the left by a burst of acceler-
ation and comes nearly to a stop before being rapidly ac-
celerated (1200 times the acceleration of gravity) upward
in a cork-screw motion. This trajectory illustrates the dif-
ﬁculty in following tracer particles—a particle’s acceler-
ation can go from zero to 30 times its rms value and back
to zero in fractions of a millisecond and within distances
of hundreds of micrometers.

Conventional detector technologies are effective for
low Reynolds number ﬂows[10, 11], but do not provide
adequate temporal resolution at high Reynolds numbers.
However, the requirements are met by the use of silicon
strip detectors as optical imaging elements in a particle
tracking system. The strip detectors employed in our ex-
periment (See Fig. 2a) were developed to measure particle
tracks in the vertex detector of the CLEO III experiment
operating at the Cornell Electron Positron Collider[12].
When applied to particle tracking in turbulence (See
Fig. 2b) each detector measures a one-dimensional pro-
jection of the image of the tracer particles. Using a data
acquisition system designed for the turbulence experi-
ment, several detectors can be simultaneously read out at
up to 70,000 frames per second.

The acceleration of a ﬂuid particle, a

+, in a turbulent

ﬂow is given by the Navier-Stokes equations,

where p is the pressure, ρ is the ﬂuid density, and u is the
velocity ﬁeld. In fully developed turbulence the viscous

The acceleration variance is larger for the transverse
component than for the axial component at all values of
the Reynolds number. This is shown in the inset to Fig. 4
where the ratio of the Kolmogorov constants for the ax-
ial and transverse acceleration components is plotted as
a function of Reynolds number. The anisotropy is large
at low Reynolds number and diminishes to a small value
at Rλ = 970. This observation tends to conﬁrm recent
experimental results which indicate that anisotropy may
persist to much higher Reynolds numbers than previously
believed[19, 20].

In summary, our measurements indicate that

the
Heisenberg-Yaglom scaling of acceleration variance is
observed for 500 ≤ Rλ ≤ 970. At lower Reynolds
number, our measurements are consistent with the anoma-
lous scaling observed in DNS[14, 16]. Our measurements
show that the anisotropy of the large scales affects the
acceleration components even at Rλ ≈ 1000. It is im-
possible to say on the basis of these measurements if
the anisotropy will persist as the Reynolds number ap-
proaches inﬁnity. We found the acceleration distribution
to be very intermittent, with extremely large accelerations
often arising in vortical structures such as the one shown
in Fig. 1.

Our results have immediate application for the develop-
ment of Lagrangian stochastic models, some of which use
a0 directly as a model constant. These models are being
developed and used to efﬁciently simulate mixing, par-
ticulate transport, and combustion in practical ﬂows with
varying Reynolds numbers[3, 21, 22]. Our research also
has surprising implications for everyday phenomena. For
instance, a mosquito ﬂying on a windy day (wind speed
18 km/h and an altitude of 1 meter) would experience an
rms acceleration of 15 m/s2. But given the extremely in-
termittent nature of the acceleration, our mosquito could
expect to experience accelerations of 150 m/s2 (15 times
the acceleration of gravity) every 15 seconds. This may
explain why, under windy conditions, a mosquito would
prefer to cling to a blade of grass rather than take part in
the roller coaster ride through the Earth’s turbulent bound-
ary layer[23].

damping term is small compared to the pressure gradient
term[13, 14] and therefore the acceleration is closely re-
lated to the pressure gradient.

Our measurement of the distribution of accelerations is
shown in Figure 3, where the probability density func-
tion of a normalized acceleration component is plotted
at three Reynolds numbers. All of the distributions have
a stretched exponential shape, in which the tails extend
much further than they would for a Gaussian distribution
with the same variance. This indicates that accelerations
many times the rms value are not as rare as one might ex-
pect, i.e., the acceleration is extremely intermittent. The
acceleration ﬂatness, shown in the inset to Fig. 3, char-
acterizes the intermittency of the acceleration, and would
be 3 for a Gaussian distribution. These ﬂatness values
are consistent with direct numerical simulation (DNS) at
low Reynolds number[14] and exceed 60 at the highest
Reynolds numbers.

The prediction by Heisenberg and Yaglom for the vari-
ance of an acceleration component based on K41 theory
is

haiaji = a0ǫ3/2ν−1/2δij ,

(2)

where a0 is a universal constant which is approximately 1
in a model assuming Gaussian ﬂuctuations[6, 7, 15, 13].
However, DNS has found that a0 depends on ǫ. Con-
ventionally this is expressed in terms of the Taylor mi-
croscale Reynolds number, Rλ, which is related to the
conventional Reynolds number by Rλ = (15Re)1/2 and
is proportional to ǫ1/6. Using this notation, DNS results
indicate a0 ∼ R1/2
for Rλ < 250[14], with a tendency to
level off as Rλ approaches 470[16].

λ

Our measurement of the Kolmogorov constant a0 is
shown in Fig. 4 for eight orders of magnitude of scal-
ing in acceleration variance. We ﬁnd a0 to be anisotropic
and to depend signiﬁcantly on the Reynolds number. The
a0 values for both components increase as a function of
Reynolds number up to Rλ ≈ 500, above which they are
approximately constant. The trend in a0 is consistent with
DNS results in the range 140 ≤ Rλ ≤ 470[14, 17, 16].
However, the constant value of a0 at high Reynolds num-
ber suggests that K41 scaling becomes valid at higher
Reynolds numbers. Weak deviations from the K41 scal-
ing such as the a0 ∼ R0.135
prediction of the multifractal
model by Borgas[18] cannot be ruled out by our measure-
ments.

Figure 1: MEASURED PARTICLE TRAJECTORY The 3-
dimensional time-resolved trajectory of a 46 micrometer
diameter particle in a turbulent water ﬂow at Reynolds
number 63,000 (Rλ = 970). A sphere marks the mea-
sured position of the particle in each of 300 frames
taken every 0.014 ms (≈ τη/20). The shading indicates
the acceleration magnitude, with the maximum value of
12,000 m/s2 corresponding to approximately 30 standard
deviations. The turbulence is generated between coaxial
counter-rotating disks[24, 25] in a closed ﬂow chamber of
volume 0.1 m3 with rotation rates ranging from 0.15 Hz
to 7.0 Hz, giving rms velocity ﬂuctuation ˜u in the range
0.018m/s < ˜u < 0.87m/s. Measurements are made in
an 8 mm3 volume at the center of the apparatus where
the mean velocity is zero and the ﬂow is nearly homo-
geneous but not isotropic. As a result of a mean stretch-
ing of the ﬂow along the propeller axis the rms ﬂuctu-
ations are 1/3 larger for the transverse velocity compo-
nents than for the axial component. The energy dissipa-
tion was determined from measurements of the transverse
second order structure function and the Kolmogorov re-
3 C1 (ǫr)2/3 with C1 = 2.13[26]. The
lation DN N = 4
dissipation was found to be related to the rms velocity
ﬂuctuation by ǫ = ˜u3/L with an energy injection scale
L = (71 ± 7) mm. Using the deﬁnition of the Taylor mi-
croscale Reynolds number Rλ = (15˜uL/ν)1/2 the range
of Reynolds numbers accessible is 140 ≤ Rλ ≤ 970, (in
terms of the classical Reynolds number 1300 ≤ Re ≤
63, 000). At the highest Reynolds number the system is
characterized by Kolmogorov distance and time scales of
η = 18 µm and τη = 0.3 ms, respectively.

is represented by blue triangles[14] and green circles[16].
The error bars represent random and systematic errors in
the measurement of the acceleration variance. There is
an additional uncertainty of 15% in the overall scaling of
the vertical axis for the experimental data due to the un-
certainty in the measured value of the energy dissipation.
The degree to which the 45 µm diameter tracer particles
follow the ﬂow was investigated by measuring the accel-
eration variance as a function of particle size and density.
The results, to be published elsewhere, conﬁrm that the
acceleration variance of the 45µm particles is within a few
percent of the zero particle size limit. The inset shows the
ratio of the a0 values for transverse and axial components
of the acceleration.

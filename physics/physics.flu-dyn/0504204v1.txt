The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation with inﬁnitesimal surface tension, dynamically develops
sharply connected valley structures within which the height derivative is not continuous.In addition
the Burgers equation in the inviscid limit develop singular structures(shocks). We discuss the
intermittency issue in the problem of forced KPZ and Burgers equations in 1 + 1–dimensions. It is
proved that the moments of height increments Ca =< |h(x1) − h(x2)|a > behave as |x1 − x2|βa with
βa = a for time scales |x1 − x2| << σx. The time scale σx is the characteristic time of the forcing
term. We have checked the analytical results by direct numerical simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The growth, formation and morphology of interfaces
has been one of the recent interesting ﬁelds of study be-
cause of its high technical and rich theoretical advan-
tages. On account of the disorder nature embedded in
the surface growth, stochastic diﬀerential equations have
been used as a suitable tool for understanding the behav-
ior of various growth processes. Such equations typically
describe the interfaces at large length scales, which means
that the short length scale details has been neglected in
order to derive a continuum equation by focusing on the
coarse grained properties. A great deal of recent theo-
retical modeling has been started with the work of Ed-
ward and Wilkinson describing the dynamics of height
ﬂuctuations by a simple linear stochastic equation [1-5].
By adding a new term proportional to the square of the
height gradient, Kardar, Parisi and Zhang made an ap-
propriate description for lateral interface growth [6]. The
(1 + 1)-dimensional forced KPZ equation is written as

ht(x, t) =

(hx)2 + νhxx + f (x, t)

(1)

α
2

where α ≥ 0 and f (x, t) is a zero-mean, statistically ho-
mogeneous, white in time random force with covariance

hf (x, t)f (x′, t′)i = 2D0D(x − x′)δ(t − t′).

(2)

Typically the spatial correlation of the forcing is con-
sidered to be a delta function, mimicking the short length
correlation. Here the spatial correlation is considered as

D(x − x′) =

1

(πσ2)1/2 exp(−

(x − x′)2

)

(3)

where σ is much less than the system size L, i.e. σ << L,
which represents a short range character for the random
forcing. The KPZ equation has come to famous the

the simplest equation nevertheless capturing the main
determinants of the growth dynamics i.e. nonlinearity,
stochasticity, and locality. The theoretical richness of
the KPZ model is partly due to close relationships with
other areas of statistical physics. It is shown that there
is a mapping between the equilibrium statistical mechan-
ics of a two dimensional smectic-A liquid crystal onto
the non-equilibrium dynamics of the (1+1)- dimensional
stochastic KPZ equation [7].
It has been shown in [8]
that, one can map the kinetics of the annihilation pro-
cess A + B → 0 with driven diﬀusion onto the (1+1)-
dimensional KPZ equation. Also the KPZ equation is
closely related to the dynamics of a sine-Gordon chain
[9], the driven-diﬀusion equation [10,11], high Tc- super-
conductor [12] and directed paths in the random media
[13-26] and charge density waves [27], dislocations in dis-
ordered solids [3], formation of large-scale structure in
the universe [28-31] , Burgers turbulence [32-60] and etc.
It is useful to rescale the KPZ equation as h′ = h/h0,
ν )1/2 and
r′ = r/r0 and t′ = t/t0.
t0 = r2
ν , where r0 is a characteristic length, all of the
parameters can be eliminated, except the coupling con-
stant g = α2D0
. The limit g → ∞ (or zero tension limit,
ν3
ν → 0), is known as the strong coupling limit [60]. Phase
diagram information extracted from the renormalisation
group ﬂow indicates that d = 2 plays the role of a lower
critical dimension. For d ≤ 2, the Gaussian ﬁxed point
(α = 0) is infrared-unstable, and there is a crossover
to the stable strong coupling ﬁxed point. For d > 2, a
third ﬁxed point exists, which represents the roughening
transition. It is unstable and appears between the Gaus-
sian and strong coupling ﬁxed points which are now both
stable. Only the critical indices of the strong-coupling
regime (g → ∞ or ν → 0) are known in 1+1 dimen-
sions and their values in higher dimensions as well as
properties of the roughening transition have been known
only numerically [61-67], and the various approximation

schemes [68-76].

For ﬁnite σ, in the strong coupling limit (ν → 0) non-
linear term in the KPZ equation will dominate. The non-
linearity of the KPZ equation in this limit includes the
possibility of singularity formations in a ﬁnite time as a
result of the local minima instability. Meaning that there
is a competition between the diﬀusion smoothing eﬀect
( the Laplacian term), and the enhancement of non-zero
slopes. In one spatial dimension the sharp valleys are de-
veloped in a ﬁnite time. As indicated in ﬁgs.(1) and (2),
the geometrical picture consists of a collection of sharp
valleys intervening a series of hills in the stationary state
[77].

The main diﬃculty with the KPZ equation is that it
is controlled, in all dimensions, by a strong disorder ( or
strong coupling) ﬁxed point and eﬃcient tools are miss-
ing to calculate the exponents and other universal prop-
erties e.g. scaling functions, amplitudes, etc. Despite the
fact that in one dimension, the exponents are known, but
many properties, including the probability density func-
tion (PDF) of the height of a growing interface have been
so far measured only in numerical simulations.

In this article, we investigate the statistical proper-
ties of the KPZ equation in the strong coupling limit
(ν → 0). This limit is singular, which means that
the surface develops sharp valleys in a ﬁnite time. So
starting with a ﬂat surface after a ﬁnite time scale,
−1α−2/3σ5/3 [77], sharp valley singularities
tc ≃ (π)1/6D0
are dynamically developed. In the singular points spatial
derivative of the ﬁeld h(x, t) is not continuous. One of the
main problem in this area is the scaling behavior of mo-
ments of height increments Ca =< |h(x1) − h(x2)|a >
and the probability density function (PDF) of δh =
h(x1) − h(x2), that is P (δh). Inspired by the methods
proposed recently by Weinan E and Vanden Eijnden [47],
a statistical method is developed to describe the moments
of the height and height gradient increments. We derive
a master equation for joint PDF of the height and its
gradient increments in 1+1 dimensions. It is shown that
in the stationary state where the sharp valleys are fully
developed, the relaxation term with inﬁnitesimal surface
tension leading to an unclosed term in the PDF’s equa-
tion. However it is shown that the unclosed term can
be expressed in terms of statistics of some quantities de-
ﬁned on the sharp valleys. We identify each sharp valley
in position y0 with three quantities, namely the gradients
of h in the positions y0+ , y0− and its height from the ¯h.
The dynamics of these quantities are given in [77]. Here
it is proved that to leading order, when |x1 − x2| << σ,
ﬂuctuation of the height ﬁeld is not intermittent. The an-
alytic form of the amplitudes of the structure functions is
also given. The absence of the intermittency means that
Ca =< |h(x1) − h(x2)|a > scales as |x1 − x2|ξa , where
ξa is a linear function of a. It is proved that for length
scales |x1 − x2| << σ, the exponents ξa are equal to a.

The paper is organized as follows; in section two, we

present the known results for the moments of height in-
crements Ca =< |h(x1) − h(x2)|a > ,for length scales
|x1 − x2| >> σ. In section three, the master equation
for the joint PDF of height and its gradient increments
has been derived for given surface tension ν and for the
length scales |x1 − x2| << σ. It is shown that the sur-
face tension term makes the PDF’s equation unclosed. In
section 4 we will consider the limit of ν → 0 of the mas-
ter equation and derive the scaling exponents of height
increments moments. Also a comparison between the an-
alytical results and direct numerical simulation are given.
Details of calculations are presented in the appendices A
and B.

LENGTH SCALES |X1 − X2| >> σ.

In this section a review of the known results for the
scaling exponent of height-diﬀerence moments for the
KPZ equation in 1 + 1-dimensions with white in time
and space forcing is given.
Indeed the limit σ → 0 is
considered in equation (2). In this limit the equation (2)
can be written as follows;

hf (x, t)f (x′.t′)i = 2D0δ(x − x′)δ(t − t′)

(4)

There are a few comments on the result obtained for
the functional PDF, equation (6). It is evident that the
probability functional (in 1 + 1-dimensions ) is indepen-
dent of the coeﬃcient of the nonlinear term i.e. α, so the
result is independent of the strength of the coupling con-
stant. As it can be seen the scaling relation is similar to
an ordinary random walk problem. If one considers the
random force with smooth spatial correlation, the prob-
lem changes to a more complicated one and there is no
any closed solution for the functional PDF.

In this section, considering the (1+1)-dimensional
Burgers equation, the master equation describing the
evolution of the two point PDF, P (u(t1) − u(t2)) is de-
rived. The (1+1) dimensional burgers equation can be

(16)

In equation (15) the terms F and G are the only terms
which are not closed respect to Z. Indeed the term F

where K(x) = 2D0D(x) and x = x1 − x2. So G is the
only term preventing equation (15) to be closed which
can be referred to a sort of dissipative anomaly.

The PDF P (h1, h2, u1, u2, x1, x2, t) is deﬁned as the
two-point joint probability density function (PDF) at the
points x1 and x2 with their related heights h1 and h2, and
their gradients u1 and u2. The PDF can be constructed
by Fourier transforming the generating function Z

where f (x, t) is a zero-mean, statistically homogeneous,
white in time random force. Its covariance is given by

interested in writing an evolution equation for the PDF‘s
of height and its gradients diﬀerence. We change the

It is clear that the Gδ, which is proportional to surface
tension ν, makes the master equation unclosed. In the

IV. CALCULATION OF THE MOMENTS AND
NUMERICAL SIMULATION

As shown in the previous section, the presence of sur-
face tension ν, makes the master equation unclosed.
However in the limit ν → 0 (that is the KPZ equa-
tion with an inﬁnitesimal surface tension) one can
ﬁnd exact scaling exponents of the moments h|h(x1) −
h(x2)|a|u(x1) − u(x2)|bi.
It should be noted that the
u-ﬁeld satisfying the Burgers equation, for ﬁnite σ’s, de-
velops discontinues or shock solutions in the limit ν → 0.
Consequently for ﬁnite σ the height ﬁeld shows up as a
set of sharp valleys at the positions where the shocks are
located, continuously connected by some hill conﬁgura-
tions, as indicated in Figs.(1) and (2). As mentioned,
each sharp valley in position y0 is identiﬁed by three
quantities, namely the gradients of h in positions y0+ ,
y0− and it’s height from ¯h. It is evident that the term
limν→0 νuxx is zero at the positions where no sharp valley
exists. Therefore in the limit ν → 0, only small intervals
around the sharp valleys will contribute to the integral
in the eq.(24). Within these intervals, boundary layer
analysis can be used for obtaining an accurate approxi-
mation of u(x, t), ˜h(x, t) = h − ¯h. Generally, boundary
layer analysis deals with those problems in which pertur-
bations are operative over very narrow regions where the
dependent variables undergo very rapid changes across
them. These narrow regions (sharp valley layers) fre-
quently adjoin the boundaries of the domain of interest,
owing the fact that a small parameter (ν in the present
problem) multiplies the highest derivative. A powerful
method for treating the boundary layer problems is the
method of matched asymptotic expansions. The basic
idea underlying this method is that an approximate so-
lution to a given problem is sought not as a single ex-
pansion in terms of a single scale, but as two or more
separate expansions in terms of two or more scales each
of which is valid in part of the domain. The scales are
chosen, so that the expansion as a whole, covers the whole
domain of interest and the domains of validity of neigh-
boring expansions overlap. In order to handle the rapid
variations in the sharp valley layers, a suitable magniﬁed
or stretched scale and expand the functions in terms of it
in the sharp valley regions is deﬁned. For this purpose,
we split u and ˜h into a sum of inner solution near the
sharp valleys and an outer solution away from the sharp
valleys, and use systematic matched asymptotics to con-
struct uniform approximation of u and ˜h. It should be
emphasized that at point y0 the height itself is continu-
ous and height gradient (corresponding Burgers velocity)
is not continuous. At these singular points the meaning
of u± is that u±(y0, t) = u(y0±, t). Keeping in mind that
u− > u+, the shock strength s and the shock velocity u
are deﬁned as s = u+ − u− and u = 1

2 (u+ + u−).

parts of ∂xh and ∂xu, respectively. For a = 0, our result
will recover the known results for Burgers equation with

To prove the eq.(25), we have used the fact that the
length scale σ is ﬁnite and x is let to approach zero. This
means that we are dealing with the scaling behaviour of
the moments h|δh|a|δu|bi for length scales |x1 − x2| <<
It is evident that in these length scales the height

Indeed we
ﬁnd the exponent ξa = a for any moments.

The moments of the height and height-gradient incre-
ments i.e. h|h(x1) − h(x2)|ai and h|u(x1) − u(x2)|bi are
also calculated numerically as a function of |x| = |x1 −x2|
for diﬀerent a’s and b’s. To simulate the problem , the
KPZ equation is discretized in space and time with scales
δ and dt respectively. The time scale dt is related to δ
as dt = 3
, where um is the maximum of the height
4
gradient in each time step [78,79]. At each time step the
diﬀerence Uj = |u(xj + 1) − u(xj )| is checked for every
1
point j’s. For Uj‘s that Uj > |δ|
3 , we can determine the
positions that the height ﬁeld develop a sharp valley [57].
Indeed this is a criterion for creation of a sharp valley in
1
3 the ﬁelds
position xj = yj. At points that Uj < |δ|
u(xj) and h(xj) belong to the smooth part. Therefore
the height ﬁelds h(xj ) will fall into two regimes, points
far from the sharp valleys points yj and the points in it’s
neighborhoods. For the points which the height ﬁeld is
regular or smooth, the height ﬁelds and it’s correspond-
ing gradients evolve under the KPZ and Burgers equation
by setting the surface tension zero. Otherwise it is in the
singularity or sharp valley region. As mentioned in the
introduction, every sharp valley can be characterized by
four parameters s, ¯u, yj and h(yj). The time evolution
of these quantities are given by the following equations

where γ = ¯ht.

To calculate numerically the scaling behaviour of mo-
ments with x when x << σ, a periodic one dimensional
substrate consisting a discrete N-point height ﬁeld with
the length of 10000 is used. Starting with a ﬂat initial
condition the height and its gradient ﬁelds evolve in time.
We consider the random force as a white in time, smooth
and periodic in space random function which it’s spatial
correlation length is of the order of period of the given
periodic function. To generate this type of forcing we
use the kicking method which recently has been used in
[51], to simulate the Burgers turbulence. The basic idea
is that the random force can be decomposed as follows,

f (x, t) =

fj(x) δ(t − tj)

(27)

j
X

where δ is the Dirac distribution and where both the “im-
pulses” fj(x) and the “kicking times” tj are prescribed
(deterministic or random). The kicking times are or-
dered and form a ﬁnite or inﬁnite sequence.
In this
article the impulses are always taken smooth and act-
ing only at length scales σ. Newman & McKane [80]
have used similar kicking, in a context where the forced
Burgers equation is used for the study of directed poly-
mers. Kraichnan [48] has considered a simple model in
which there are non-smooth impulses creating directly
saw-tooth proﬁles in the velocity in Burgers turbulence.
Here the time intervals are equal to the time steps of the
algorithm’s run.

In Figs.(1) and (2), we illustrate diﬀerent snapshots
of the time-evolution of the height, considering diﬀerent
correlation lengths σ for the random periodic force, until
the time that the system ﬁnally reaches to it’s stationary
state. The following type of kicking force is used

F (x, t) = A(t)[cos(kx − ϕ(t)) +

sin(kx − ϕ(t))],

(28)

3

where A is a white Gaussian random variable in time,
which is the noise amplitude and ϕ is a homogeneous
random phase. Choosing diﬀerent values for k, leads to
diﬀerent values for σ. The length scale σ is of the order
of the period of F . In Fig.(3), the log-linear plot of the
moments of height increments are sketched numerically
for a = 0.7, 5 and 7, respectively. We have found the
exponents ξa = ra + q, where r = 1.00 ± 0.01 and q =
−0.0012 ± 0.0002. The scaling behaviour of the moments
of height gradients increments for length scales x << σ
is also checked. The results implies that with a good
precision h|δu|bi scales with x with exponent 1 for b’s
larger than one, and scales with x with exponents ξb =
b, for b’s smaller than one with precision ±0.001. The
behaviour of ξb vs b is also plotted in ﬁg.(3).

i.e.

In summary, we study the problem of non-equilibrium
surface growth described by the forced KPZ equation in
1+1 dimensions. The forcing is a white in time Gaus-
sian noise but with a Gaussian correlation in space with
variance σ. Modeling a short range correlated noise, we
restrict our study to the case when the correlation length
of the forcing is much smaller than the system size. In-
vestigating the stationary state, a general expression of
the mixed correlations of height-diﬀerence and height-
gradient diﬀerence at any order, in terms of the length
scale |x1−x2| and quantities which characterize the sharp
valley singular structures is given. Through a careful
analysis being done over the behaviour of the sharp val-
ley environment, we decipher the intermittency exponent
h|h(x1) − h(x2)|ai.
of an arbitrary a-th moment,
It is proved that the height increments ﬂuctuations are
not intermittent and its a-th moments for length scales
|x1 − x2| < σ scales as |x1 − x2|ξa , where ξa = a. In the
present paper the limiting of ν → 0 is taken into account
only for ﬁnite σ . Still the forcing correlation length is
much smaller than the system size and height correlation
length. But the limit σ → 0 is a singular limit in our
calculations, and moreover, it is not a priori clear that
the limits of ν → 0 and σ → 0 commute at all. Us-
ing stochastic equations which are governed over the dy-
namics of quantities characterizing the sharp valleys we
simulate directly the problem and check the exponents.
We have generate the forcing using the kicking method.
Our simulation conﬁrm the analytical results. We believe
that the analysis followed in this paper is quite suitable
for the zero temperature limit in the problem of directed
polymer in the random potential with short range corre-
lations [81]. The same method applied to KPZ equation
in higher dimensions would be deﬁnitely one of the con-
sequent goals of the present work. The main message
which might be encoded in the present work is the im-
portance of the statistical properties of the geometrical
singular structures for understanding the strong coupling
regime of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

Appendix A

In this appendix we are going to prove that the G-term
in eq.(24), has a ﬁnite value in the limit ν → 0. As shown
in section 2 the G-term can be written as

G = G(h1, u1, h2, u2, x, t) + G(h2, u2, h1, u1, −x, t). (29)

Here we prove that in the vanishing surface tension

limit, the G term can be written as

conditional on y0 being a sharp valley position.

Let us now prove the eq.(30). Assuming spatial ergod-
icity, for example the average of one of the terms in G,
which is proportional to ν, can be expressed as

These results show that, to O(ν), eq.(31) can be esti-

Clearly, in the limit as ν → 0 only small intervals
around the sharp valleys will contribute to the integral.
In these intervals, boundary layer analysis can be used to
obtain an accurate approximation of ui(x, t) and hi(x, t).
The basic idea is to split ui and hi into the sum of an
inner solution near the sharp valleys and an outer solu-
tion away from the singular point, and using systematic
matched asymptotic to construct uniform approximation
of u1 and hi (for details see, e.g., [77]). For the outer so-
lution, we look for an approximation in the form of a
series in ν

(¯h1, ¯u(y0, t), s(y0, t), h2(y0 + x, t), u2(y0 + x, t))

conditional on y0 being a sharp valley position. It should
be emphasized that when we say y0 is a singular point,
we mean that however the height itself is continuous at
y0 the height gradient (corresponding Burgers velocity)
is not continues at these points. At these singular points
the meaning of u± is that u±(y0, t) = u(±x, t)) keeping

where pns(x, t) is the probability that there is no sharp

property that there is no sharp valley in [y, y + x). Also
P δ(ξ, ω, x, t|sharp valley) is the PDF of δu(x, y, t) and
δh(x, y, t) conditional on the property that there is at

where H(·) is the Heaviside function and we used
S(s, t) = 0 for s > 0 since s(y0, t) ≤ 0. Inserting this
expression in (49), the solution of this equation is

A(ξ, ω, t) = (−δ(ω) + ρhsiδ1(ω) + ρS(ω, t))δ(ξ)

Here δ1(ω) = dδ(ω)/dω and ω used the identity
ωδ1(ω) = −δ(ω). Using the fact that ρ < s >= − < ηu >
[47], we can be restated A(ξ, ω, t) as

A(ξ, ω, t) = (−δ(ω) − hηuiδ1(ω) + ρS(ω, t))δ(ξ).

Hence, combining the above results, we have

P δ(ξ, ω, x, t) = (δ(ω) − x(δ(ω) + hηuiδ1(ω) − ρS(ω, t)))δ(ξ)

We

can
write R(ξ, ω, x, t) as 1
2 R(ξ−, ω, −|x|, t)
where for R(ξ+, ω, |x|, t) and R(ξ−, ω, |x|, t), with condi-
tion that ξ = h(y0+|x|)−h(y0) and ξ = h(y0+|x|)−h(y0),
respectively. When x → 0 we can write ξ± = u±|x|.
Since M can be made arbitrarily large, we get

dξdω|ξ|a|ω|b(Z δ − f δ) ≤ o(xa+b) + δM O(x)

The term

lated in the x → ±0 limit. This can be done by using
R
the relation (43). Note that

If we go back and look carefully to the deﬁnition δu±,
we see that δh± ≃ u±|x| ≃ o(x) and δu± ≃ o(x) as
x → 0. While it should be realized that the sharp valley
strength s is of the order O(1) as ǫ → 0, so in the limit
x → 0, the result of the integral would be simpliﬁed as

We obtain (25) for 0 ≤ b ≤ 1. For b > 1 the leading
term in our calculation, will be the second term of the
eq.(56) with the order of o(xa+1). The leading term is
1
2 ρh|s|(|u+|a + |u−|a)i.

Finally multiplying the terms of the equation (57) in
|ξ|n and |ω|m and integrating over the variables ξ and ω
we have

where the result coincides perfectly with the eq.(25)
which is the general form of eq.(60).

Abstract

Stability, bifurcation properties, and the spatiotemporal behavior of diﬀerent nonlinear combi-

nation structures of spiral vortices in the counter rotating Taylor-Couette system are investigated

by full numerical simulations and by coupled amplitude equation approximations. Stable cross-

spiral structures with continuously varying content of left and right spiral modes are found. They

provide a stability transferring connection between the initially stable, axially counter propagating

wave states of pure spirals and the axially standing waves of so-called ribbons that become stable

slightly further away from onset of vortex ﬂow.

The combination of two counter propagating plane linear traveling waves (TWs) of equal

amplitude creates a standing wave (SW). This property is also the reason for the possibility

of SW structures in a variety of nonlinear pattern forming systems that show an oscillatory

instability and inversion symmetry in one or more spatial directions [1]. Then two symmetry

degenerate counter propagating TW structures as well as a nonlinear SW solution appear at

the common oscillatory bifurcation threshold. However, in many systems like, e.g., binary

mixture convection TW solutions bifurcate subcritically being initially amplitude unstable

and then become strongly nonlinear on the stable upper solution branch. Moreover, the SW

solution is often amplitude unstable and/or unstable against phase propagation and TW

formation.

Thus, we consider here nonlinear combination states of left-spiral vortex (L-SPI) and

right-spiral vortex (R-SPI) structures that — being mirror images of each other — travel

either upwards or downwards in the annulus between two counter rotating cylinders of a

Taylor-Couette setup [2, 3]. This system oﬀers an easy experimental and numerical access

(i) to forwards bifurcating initially stable TWs (i.e., L-SPI and R-SPI), (ii) to forwards

bifurcating SWs [called ribbons (RIBs) in the Taylor-Couette literature [2, 3]] that become

stable slightly above threshold, and in particular also (iii) to stable cross-spirals (CR-SPI),

i.e., combinations of L-SPI and R-SPI with diﬀerent amplitudes which provide a stability

transferring connection between TW and SW solution branches. This bifurcation scenario

does not seem to have been reported so far [4].

Here, we describe stability, bifurcation properties, and the spatiotemporal behavior of

the three oscillatory structures (i)-(iii) by two amplitude equations with a coupling that

contains necessarily also a quintic order term to enable CR-SPI solutions. Their results are

compared with numerical solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations that we obtained for

a system with radius ratio η = 1/2 by methods described in [9].

The vortex structures (i)-(iii) are axially and azimuthally periodic with wave numbers

k = 2π/λ and M, respectively, with λ = 1.3 and M = 2 throughout this paper. They

rotate with characteristic constant angular velocities into the same direction as the inner

cylinder [9] and thereby they are forced to propagate axially except for RIB vortices which

only rotate but do not propagate.

In order to characterize the spatiotemporal properties of the vortices we used also Fourier

For example, L-SPI (R-SPI) ﬂow contains only modes with m = nM (m = −nM) since it

does not depend on ϕ, z, t separately but only on the phase combination φA = Mϕ+kz −ωAt

(φB = Mϕ − kz − ωBt). Here we use A and B to identify L-SPI and R-SPI properties,

respectively. For SPI that are axial mirror images of each other the modes in (1) oscillate
according to fm,n(r, t) = δm,±nM e−i(m/M )ωt ˜f±n(r) with a common frequency ωA = ωB =

ω(k, M). Thus, the color-coded plots in Fig. 1(a,b) of the SPI in the ϕ − z plane of an

’unrolled’ cylindrical surface are patterns of straight stripes. They both move in positive

ϕ-direction, i.e., into the direction of rotation of the inner cylinder [9] with angular phase

velocity ˙ϕSP I = ω/M. The L-SPI propagates upwards with axial phase velocity wA
and and its mirror image the R-SPI propagates downwards, wB

ph = −ω/k .

ph = ω/k

On the other hand, a CR-SPI is a kind of combination of a L-SPI and a R-SPI with

diﬀerent ﬂow amplitudes and diﬀerent frequencies. Thus, the CR-SPI spectrum contains

two frequencies, say, ωS and ωD, that are in general incommensurate. Within the amplitude

equation approximation presented below ωS = (ωA + ωB)/2 and ωD = (ωA − ωB)/2. For the

CR-SPI in Fig. 1(c) the amplitude of the L-SPI content is larger than the R-SPI content

while ωA < ωB. Then the periodic deformation of the L-SPI-dominated stripe pattern in

Fig. 1(c) that is caused by the minority R-admixture propagates axially downwards with

velocity ωD/k while rotating with angular velocity ωS/M. The CR-SPI in Fig. 1(d) is the

mirror image of Fig. 1(c) with reverse amplitude and frequency relations. For all CR-SPI

investigated here ωS ≫ |ωD|. RIB states are degenerate CR-SPI states with equal content

of R-SPI and L-SPI contributions and ωD = 0 which do not propagate axially.

Fig. 2 shows for two diﬀerent R1 bifurcation diagrams of SPI, CR-SPI, and RIB solutions

versus R2 and its reduced distance µ = (R2 − R0

RIB ﬂow. Here R1 and R2 are the Reynolds numbers deﬁned by the rotational velocities

of the inner and outer cylinder, respectively. Order parameters are the squared amplitudes

(|A|2, |B|2) and frequencies (ωA, ωB) of the dominant modes

in the decomposition (1) of the radial velocity u at mid-gap. For all vortex structures

February 20, 2014

investigated here the moduli and frequencies of u2,±1 in Eq. (2) are constant.

The L-SPI (A 6= 0, B = 0) shown in Fig. 2 by circles and the RIB solution (A = B) marked

by diamonds bifurcate at µ = 0 with common linear frequency ω0 out of the unstructured

CCF. However, with increasing µ their frequencies vary diﬀerently. The squared amplitudes

of these two states grow basically linearly with µ, albeit with diﬀerent slopes.

Initially, the SPI is stable and the RIB is unstable. But then there appears at larger

µ a stable CR-SPI solution (triangles) which transfers stability from the SPI to the RIB.

The CR-SPI (A 6= B) bifurcates with B = 0 and ﬁnite ωB out of the L-SPI as shown in

Fig. 2 (bifurcation out of the symmetry degenerate R-SPI is analogous — just exchange A

and B). Then |B| grows and |A| decreases while ωA increases and ωB becomes smaller until

the CR-SPI solution branches end with A = B and ωA = ωB in the RIB state. The latter

loses stability outside the plot range of Fig. 2 to amplitude-modulated CR-SPI that are not

discussed here.

Spatiotemporal properties, bifurcation, and stability behavior of the SPI, RIB, and CR-

SPI states close to onset can reasonably well be explained and described within an amplitude-

equation approach. Therein the ﬁelds are represented by the superposition — here written

down, e.g., for the radial velocity u(r, ϕ, z, t) —

u = (cid:2)A(t)ˆuA(r)eikz + B(t)ˆuB(r)e−ikz

(cid:3) ei(M ϕ−ω0t) + c.c.

(3)

of just the linear critical modes ˆuA,B(r)e±ikzei(M ϕ−ω0t) of L- and R-SPI with slowly varying
amplitudes A and B, respectively. Here we normalize |ˆuA| and |ˆuB| to 1 at mid-gap. There

the representation (3) is quite suﬃcient. But closer to the inner cylinder the vortex ﬁelds

contain further axial and azimuthal modes that are generated via nonlinear interactions

of the critical modes. However, it seems that close to onset they do not inﬂuence deci-

sively the bifurcation and stability behavior that is governed by the modes retained in the

approximation (3).

In order to reproduce the bifurcation and stability behavior of the aforementioned vortex

states including the CR-SPI one needs coupled equations for A and B of at least quintic

order [10]. Higher-order terms that are suggested in [3] are not necessary to ensure existence

of CR-SPI solutions. Symmetry arguments [3] and simplicity considerations discussed below

restrict the form of the equations to

˙A = (cid:2)aµ + b|A|2 + c|B|2 + e (cid:0)|A|2 − |B|2
˙B = (cid:2)aµ + b|B|2 + c|A|2 + e (cid:0)|B|2 − |A|2

(cid:1) |B|2
(cid:1) |A|2

(cid:3) A
(cid:3) B .

The coeﬃcients a − e are complex but only the moduli |A| and |B| enter into the square

brackets. We have determined all coeﬃcients by comparing with bifurcation diagrams ob-

tained for the ﬂow at mid-gap position.

We are seeking solutions of (4) of the form A(t) = |A|e−iΩAt , B(t) = |B|e−iΩBt with
constant moduli and frequencies. Here ΩA,B = ωA,B −ω0 are the deviations of the frequencies

from the critical ones according to (2, 3).

In view of Fig. 2 we have neglected here for simplicity reasons quintic contributions to SPI

amplitudes and frequencies by discarding terms of the form d|A|4A and d|B|4B in (4a) and

(4b), respectively. Taking a = 1 + ai one then has |A|2 = µ/(−br) and ΩA = −aiµ − bi|A|2

for, say, a L-SPI (for a R-SPI replace A by B). The indices r and i denote real and imaginary

parts, respectively. As an aside we mention that a linear variation of ΩA with |A|2 holds for

SPI also signiﬁcantly further away from onset than in Fig. 2.

Motivated by Fig. 2 we also discard quintic contributions to the modulus and to the

frequency of the RIB state. This is enforced by making in the terms f |B|4A and f |A|4B

that appear on general grounds in (4a) and (4b), respectively, the special choice f = −e.

Then the RIB solution is characterized by |A|2 = |B|2 = µ/(−br − cr) and ΩA = ΩB =
−aiµ − (bi + ci)|A|2.

The CR-SPI solution with ﬁnite A 6= B exists only for nonzero coupling e. It is most

conveniently found and expressed in terms of the combined order parameters

S = (|A|2 + |B|2)/2

, D = (|A|2 − |B|2)/2

ΩS = (ΩA + ΩB)/2

,

ΩD = (ΩA − ΩB)/2 .

(5a)

(5b)

Then the radial velocity ﬁeld (3) of the CR-SPI at mid-gap can be written into the form u =
(cid:2)|A|ei(kz−ΩDt) + |B|e−i(kz−ΩDt)
frequency ωS = ω0 + ΩS and the axial propagation of the deformation that is governed by

the frequency ωD = ΩD.

The CR-SPI solution of (4) reads

S = (cr − br)/(2er) , D2 = [µ + (br + cr)S]/(2er)

−ΩS = aiµ + (bi + ci)S − 2eiD2

, −ΩD = (bi − ci + 2eiS)D .

Note that S is constant in this CR-SPI. D grows via a pitchfork bifurcation at µ2 = −(br +
cr)S out of the RIB (D = 0) and connects at µ1 = −2brS with D = |A|2/2 = S with the
L-SPI and with D = −|B|2/2 = −S with the R-SPI.

In Figs. 2 - 4 we compare bifurcation diagrams of SPI, RIB, and CR-SPI solutions re-

sulting from the amplitude equations [11] (thin lines) with those from the full numerical

simulations (symbols). For the sake of presentational clarity the stability of the former is

not indicated in these ﬁgures. But stability analyses of the three vortex states in question

conﬁrms that the CR-SPI solution (6) transfers stability between the RIB and the SPI states

as indicated in Fig. 5.

We should like to mention that keeping the discarded quintic terms by setting d 6= 0 and

f 6= −e slightly improves the agreement between the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations

and the amplitude equation approximation without changing the bifurcation topology and

the stability behavior of the latter. However, then the CR-SPI solution would still have

S = const. To obtain deviations from this behavior as displayed, e.g., by the triangles of

Fig. 4(a) one needs higher orders in eqs. (4).

So, the model (4) is a minimal one in the sense that the quintic terms that are necessary

to ensure the existence of A 6= B solutions enter only into the coupling between R- and

L-SPI modes but not into the SPI and RIB solutions. Note furthermore that the coupled

amplitude equations (4) apply equally well to other systems with two distinct A and B

solutions — be they stationary or oscillatory — that are related to each other by analogous

(symmetry) requirements with similar nonlinear couplings. Thus, bifurcation diagrams in

which the pure A, the pure B, and the A = B solutions are connected with a stability

transfer by a A 6= B solution branch could also arise in these systems with a form that

would be (topologically) similar to that of Fig. 5.

[10] S. Fauve, S. Douady, and O. Thual, J. Phys. II 1, 311 (1991) show that a non-potential linear

coupling which is forbidden here can cause a pitchfork drift bifurcation of parametrically

excited surface SWs into reﬂection symmetry breaking traveling states with A 6= B.

[11] We have determined the coeﬃcients as follows: a linear analysis of the ﬂow dynamics gave

ω0 = 150.9 (117.0) and ai = 45.13 (15.97) for R1 = 240 (R1 = 200). Then br and bi

were obtained by ﬁtting |A|2 and ΩA, respectively, of the nonlinear numerical SPI solution.

Thereafter cr and ci were ﬁxed analogously with the numerical RIB solutions. Finally, e

was determined with the CR-SPI. The results are 100b = −0.245 + i 83.54 (−0.659 + i 132.8),

100c = −1.06 − i 554 (−2.517 − i 383.9), 100e = −3.251 + i 118.4 (−1.976 + i 89.2).

[12] Unstable SPI solutions were obtained by suppressing the m = 0−mode of u. This stabilizes

the SPI against the transition to CR-SPI and RIB states which have ﬁnite m = 0− content.

The unstable RIB solution was stabilized by imposing the z → −z symmetry of this state

thereby suppressing SPI and CR-SPI solutions.

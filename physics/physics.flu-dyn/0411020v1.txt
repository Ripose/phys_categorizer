Temperature dependent magnetic properties of FePt: eﬀective spin Hamiltonian
model

A model of magnetic interactions in the ordered ferromagnetic FePt is proposed on the basis
of ﬁrst-principles calculations of non-collinear magnetic conﬁgurations and shown to be capable of
explaining recent measurements of magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). The site (Fe,Pt) resolved
contributions to the MAE have been distinguished with small Fe easy-plane and large Pt easy-
axis terms. This model has been tested against available experimental data on the temperature
dependence of MAE showing scaling of uniaxial MAE (K1(T)) with magnetization (M(T)) K1(T ) ∼
M (T )γ characterized by the unusual exponent of γ = 2.1. It is shown that this unusual behavior
of the FePt can be quantitatively explained within the proposed model and originates from an
eﬀective anisotropic exchange mediated by the induced Pt moment. The latter is expected to be
a common feature of 3d-5d(4d) alloys having 5d/4d elements with large spin-orbit coupling and
exchange enhanced Stoner susceptibility.

INTRODUCTION

Since the phenomenon of super-paramagnetism has
been identiﬁed as one of the major limits for the con-
ventional magnetic recording [1], signiﬁcant research ef-
fort has been invested in the development of materials
with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Recent
progress in the fabrication and characterization of gran-
ular and nano-particulate FePt ﬁlms [2] puts even more
emphasis on the understanding of the giant MAE of FePt
and its temperature dependence. The latter property ap-
pears to be of critical importance for the development of
future high density magnetic recording systems in par-
ticular for heat-assisted magnetic recording [1].

A systematic understanding of the temperature de-
pendence of the MAE in itinerant magnets remains a
challenge and one of the long standing problems in the
theory of magnetism. The proposed model deals with
mixed localized and itinerant magnetic moments and
thus bears general
importance as large anisotropy is
achieved by combining strongly magnetic elements with
non-magnetic ones, where the latter have large spin orbit
coupling.

The chemically ordered L10 phase of FePt has large
uniaxial MAE with the ﬁrst order anisotropy constant
K1 ≈ 108 erg/cc [1] based on the simple angular varia-
tion of MAE Eanis ∼ K1 sin2 θ. In the L10 phase the cu-
bic symmetry is broken due to the stacking of alternate
planes of the 3d element (Fe) and the 5d element (Pt)
along the [001] direction. It is well established that in this
naturally layered ferromagnet the large MAE is mainly
due to the contribution from the 5d element having large
spin-orbit (s-o) coupling while the 3d element provides
the exchange splitting of the 5d sub-lattice [3, 4, 5].

Theoretical

framework for the temperature depen-
dence of the MAE was mainly developed in the 50-
60’s. These eﬀorts led to the formulation of a general

P

quantum statistical perturbation theory (QSPT) sum-
marized by Callen and Callen [6]. This theory pro-
vides a general approach for calculating the magnetic
anisotropy free energy for the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian
H = H iso + H anis with a large isotropic H iso and a rela-
tively small anisotropic part H anis. The anisotropic part
i k2L2 (Si ), where L2 (Si )
is taken in the form H anis =
is a normalized polynomial of 2nd order in the case of
uniaxial symmetry with Si denoting a unit vector (in the
classical case) at the atomic site i [6]. This form implic-
itly assumes well localized magnetic moments leading to
a universal parametric relation between MAE (K1(T ))
and the magnetization M (T ) [6]. The two-sublattice
modiﬁcation of the QSPT proposed by Kuz’min [7] has
been successfully applied to describe MAE of the local-
ized 3d-4f magnets. Note, that all these theories pre-
dict that in the low temperature region MAE scales as
K1(T ) ∼ M 3(T ) except the very recent work by Skomski
et. al. where a mean-ﬁeld two sub-lattice Hamiltonian
for L10 CoPt led to a K1(T ) ∼ M 2(T ) dependence [8].

Recent experimental results demonstrate that the uni-
axial MAE of epitaxial FePt ﬁlms can be very accurately
ﬁtted to a K1(T ) ∼ M 2.1(T ) dependence in the low tem-
perature range [9, 10]. This observation clearly demon-
strates that the contribution of the single-ion anisotropy
(leading to the M 3 dependence) is practically missing.
Thus, the Hamiltonian used in the QSPT theory does
not necessarily reﬂect all the essential features of the
magnetic interactions in L10 FePt and possibly also of
the other 3d-4d/5d ordered alloys.

In the following we present a model of magnetic inter-
actions in FePt which is constructed and parameterized
on the basis of ﬁrst-principles calculations and is shown
to be capable of explaining on the quantitative level re-
cent measurements of the K1 ∼ M γ(T ) dependence with
non-integer exponent γ = 2.1 [9, 10]. Thus we propose
a microscopic explanation of this unusual behavior and

test our microscopic model of magnetic interactions.

The leading contribution to the anisotropic part of the
spin Hamiltonian is described as anisotropic exchange
mediated by the induced Pt atomic spin moments. The
thermodynamic behavior of this Hamiltonian is investi-
gated within the mean-ﬁeld approximation (MFA) and
in the classical limit using both Langevin dynamics and
Monte Carlo simulations. We ﬁnd that proper treatment
of the magnetic interactions mediated by the induced Pt
moment yield K1(M (T )) and M (T ) dependences in a
good quantitative agreement with experiment, including
the value of Tc. Thus the proposed atomic scale model
describes correctly the most important static magnetic
properties and thus opens the way for modeling even
more complex dynamic switching properties [11].

EFFECTIVE SPIN HAMILTONIAN MODEL
BASED ON FIRST-PRINCIPLES CLSDA
CALCULATIONS

Our analysis begins with an investigation of the
isotropic part of the spin Hamiltonian. We start
with the constrained local-spin-density-approximation
(CLSDA) calculations [12] for a non-collinear arrange-
ment of Fe and Pt atomic spin moments as summa-
rized in Fig. 1. The CLSDA method [13] allows to re-
duce the many electron problem to a minimization of
the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional EHK (ρ(~r), ~σ(~r))
of charge, ρ(~r), and spin density, ~σ(~r), with an ad-
ditional constraint term which in the case of a non-
collinear magnetic conﬁguration leads to a CLSDA func-
tional ECLSDA(ρ(~r), ~σ(~r),~h⊥
i ) with an additional La-
grange multiplier ~h⊥
i having the meaning of an internal
magnetic ﬁeld [12]. This magnetic ﬁeld is determined
self-consistently according to the condition of the de-
sired orientation of the atomic moment ~mi at the site
i. The eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations on the electronic
and spin sub-systems can be conveniently modeled with
the spin-spiral (SS) conﬁgurations representing various
degrees of short range order which is found in 3d mag-
nets for temperatures well above Tc [14]. The values of
the Fe and Pt moments for these SS conﬁgurations are
calculated in the local coordinate system, associated with
the orientation of the local quantization axis at site i as
eF
Mi =
dε, where the local density of

electronic states is a diagonal matrix over the spin indices
nσ,σ
[15, 16]. To summarize the most important results
i
obtained for various SS conﬁgurations we introduce the
convenient variable hν = Hν /H 0
ν where Hν is the ex-
change ﬁeld at site ν of the Pt sublattice normalized by
its value in the FM state H 0
ν .
In Fig.1 we present the spin moments and total ener-
gies of the non-collinear magnetic conﬁgurations calcu-
lated self-consistently within the CLSDA, using a gen-
eralization of the electronic structure method to treat

non-collinear magnetic order [12]. In Fig.1a we present
normalized values of the Fe and Pt spin moments cal-
culated as a function of h. The dependence shown in
Fig. 1a clearly demonstrates a dramatic diﬀerence in the
degree of localization for Fe and Pt spin moments, respec-
tively. The Fe spin moment remains almost constant as
a function of h (or angle θ) indicating its relatively lo-
calized nature in terms of the response to the thermal
ﬂuctuations. On the other hand, the Pt moment varies
linearly with h. This result raises the important question
how to develop an adequate model to describe a system
with mixed localized and de-localized magnetic degrees
of freedom.

The theory of magnetic interactions due to localized
magnetic moments is well established. Hence an eﬀec-
tive spin Hamiltonian associated with the localized (Fe
moments) degrees of freedom can be constructed in the
form

which relies on conﬁguration independent eﬀective ex-
change interaction parameters Jij and an eﬀective single-
ion anisotropy k (0 )
Fe . The Si are used to denote Fe sublat-
tice spin moments which can be treated as unit vector in
the classical limit. The form of the spin Hamiltonian Eq.
1 is well justiﬁed by our CLSDA results which clearly
indicate that the Stoner excitations associated with Fe
moments have much higher energy than those of the Pt.
On the other hand, the value of the induced Pt mag-
netic moment varies between 0 and a maximum value
for the FM state. The CLSDA total energy calculations
without s-o coupling (isotropic energy) presented in Fig.
1b allow to clarify how to deal with Pt magnetic degrees
of freedom. Indeed, as the scalar-relativistic calculations
show, the total energy associated with these delocalized
degrees of freedom Eiso
deloc follows very closely the relation
which can be derived from the Stoner-model expression
for the total energy [17]

also demonstrates that both the value and orientation of
the Pt moment are entirely due to the exchange ﬁeld of
the surrounding Fe moments, following very closely the
relation Mν = χνHν, where χν is the local Pt suscepti-
bility constant. As follows from the linear dependence in

the Fe and mν the Pt sub-lattice moment. The tempera-
ture dependence of χν arising from the Fermi distribution
smearing is weak and will be neglected in the following
statistical simulations.

The anisotropic part of the eﬀective spin Hamiltonian
is calculated within the CLSDA, with s-o interactions
included self-consistently, and is presented in Fig. 1b.
We ﬁnd that it can be be very accurately approximated
by a quadratic dependence on the mν parameter. We
should emphasize that owing to the delocalized nature of
5d/4d elements, in the general case this dependence can-
not be guessed prior to the rigorous calculations. How-
ever, our result for FePt allows us to identify the form

As can be seen from these expressions, the Pt in-
duced spin moments result in additional isotropic and
anisotropic contributions, both depending on the eﬀec-
tive exchange interaction parameters Jiν deﬁned in the
ferromagnetic ground state. We ﬁnd that Jiν are rel-
atively strong and positive, resulting in isotropic and
anisotropic exchange interactions both stabilizing the fer-
romagnetic order in the [001] direction (see [18]). Un-
like the Jiν , the eﬀective exchange interaction parame-
ters between Fe moments Jij appear to be sensitive to
the lattice spacing and may change sign from positive to
negative as a function of the chemical ordering [19]. Im-
portantly, the additional anisotropic contribution (Eqs.7)
which controls K1(M (T )) does not depend on Jij .

In order to assess the relative magnitudes of the single-
and two-ion terms (Eq. 5), consider for clarity the nearest
neighbor (N N ) interaction only with N being the num-
ber of N N ’s. Then the magnetic anisotropy free energy
(Fanis(T)) within the ﬁrst-order thermodynamic theory
[6] (justiﬁed by hHanisi/hHisoi ≈ 0.1, see Fig. 1b ) have
an eﬀective single and two-ion contributions with latter

tio between the single and two-ion contributions (N −

two-ion contribution, and since within the M F A type
approximation f 2(T ) ∼ M 2(T ), one can arrive at a qual-
itative explanation of the observed MAE temperature de-
pendence. Clearly, for more accurate evaluation of the ra-
tio between two and single-ion contributions the distance
dependence of the Jiν has to be taken into account. In
the following we present calculations beyond M F A and
N N approximations to provide a quantitative analysis of
the proposed model in terms of its ability to explain the
non-integer exponent of the K1 ∼ M 2.1 dependence.

THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES

In the following, we use Langevin dynamics simula-
tions described in [20] to investigate properties of the
eﬀective spin Hamiltonian Eq. 5 within the classical ap-
proximation. The exchange interactions are long-ranged
and are taken into account for a distance of up to 5
atomic unit cells via fast-Fourier-transformation, within
the same calculation as the dipolar interaction. We sim-
ulate spherical nanoparticles with open boundary con-
ditions and sizes up to 14464 moments, corresponding
to diameters up to 9.2nm. The anisotropy constant de-
ﬁned as the free energy diﬀerence between magnetiza-
tion oriented parallel or perpendicular to the easy axis
which according to the ﬁrst order perturbation theory
[6] is given by the internal anisotropic energy diﬀerence
K1(T ) = Ea(T, ~B = B~e⊥) − Ea(T, ~B = B~e||) for the
external ﬁeld ~B . Then, according to Eq. 5 single-ion
and two-ion contributions can be distinguished as sum-
marized in Fig. 2a. One can see that the two-ion term
is the dominant contribution which is nearly nine times
larger. Furthermore the data indicate a Curie temper-
ature close to the experimental value of 750K [9, 10].
In Fig. 2b we present the calculated K(M ) dependence
along with its single and two-ion contributions. Within
these calculations, which we stress go beyond MF classi-
cal approximation, the two-ion term scales as M 2(T ) in
a wide T range, while the single-ion term follows M 3(T )
scaling only at low temperatures. Since K1(T ) has both
contributions, the expression for the low T expansion

K1(T )/K1(0) ≈ α M 2 + (1 − α) M 3 ∼ M 3−α,

(9)

contains the α coeﬃcient originating from the normal-
ized two-ion contribution and the second term originat-
ing from the single-ion contribution. The parameters d(0)
and d(2)
following from our ﬁrst-principles calculations

allow us to evaluate ﬁnally the exponent of 3 − α = 2.09.
Before proceeding to a comparison with experiments

MFA QSPT calculations of the K1(M ) dependence and
corresponding two and single-ion contributions. Both,
the classical and the quantum K1(M ) dependence are
identical for the two-ion term in the whole range of tem-
peratures and for the single-ion term in the low temper-
ature range. Considering that the single-ion contribu-
tion is dominant, we can compare our Langevin dynam-
ics calculations with available experiment as shown in
Fig. 2d. As one can see, our spin Hamiltonian with ab-

initio parameterization agrees very well in a wide range
of temperatures, especially given that the low tempera-
ture measurements by Okamoto, et al. also yielded an
exponent of 2.1 [10].

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

To summarize, we propose an atomic-scale model of
magnetic interactions in ordered L10 FePt with an ef-
fective spin Hamiltonian constructed and parameterized
on the basis of ﬁrst-principles calculations. The pro-
posed model is investigated analytically and using sta-
tistical simulations. We ﬁnd that the model describes
on the quantitative level the experimentally observed
anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic
anisotropy energy. We demonstrate that this observed,
anomalous temperature dependence (K1 ∼ M 2.1(T )) is
due to the delocalized induced Pt moments, leading to an
exchange mediated two-ion anisotropy which dominates
the usually expected M 3 contribution of the single-ion
anisotropy. We believe that this mechanism is common
for various 3d-5d/4d ordered alloys having 5d/4d nomi-
nally non-magnetic elements with large s-o coupling and
Stoner enhanced susceptibility.

Mechanism of ﬁnite-amplitude double-component convection due to diﬀerent
boundary conditions

(November 10, 2012)

A new mechanism of double-component convection is discovered. It emerges in a horizontal layer
of Boussinesq ﬂuid as a stable stratiﬁcation due to ﬂux boundary conditions is added to an unstable
gradient speciﬁed by ﬁxed boundary values. A large enough perturbation substantially decreases the
stable ﬂux gradient but fails to mix the unstable ﬁxed-value gradient. Steady ﬁnite-amplitude ﬂows
reminiscent of Rayleigh—Benard convection then arise even as the net background stratiﬁcation is
stable, emphasizing the importance of the identiﬁed mechanism for double-component ﬂuid systems.

∗ Double-component convection is relevant to as di-
verse ﬁelds as small-scale oceanography [1], astrophysics
[2], crystal growth [3], and colloidal suspensions [4]. Con-
vective ﬂows are also commonly used for testing the ideas
related to transition to turbulence and nonlinear pattern
formation [5,6].
In addition, double-component ﬂows
with diﬀerent boundary conditions are of basic signiﬁ-
cance for large-scale environmental phenomena, ranging
from Langmuir circulations [7] to the global ocean ther-
mohaline circulation and climate change [8,9].

One major aspect of double-component ﬂows with dif-
ferent boundary conditions is that the eﬀect of such con-
ditions can be conceptually analogous to that of diﬀerent
diﬀusivities [10–12]. In particular, unequal diﬀusion gra-
dients forming in perturbed state due to diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions trigger convection analogously to the clas-
sical double-diﬀusion. Such analogy has been introduced
in [13–16] as a result of the generalization of an earlier
idea highlighted in [17].

This work reports the existence of a novel mecha-
nism of double-component convection. The nature of
this mechanism stems from diﬀerent boundary conditions
but is not underlain by the diﬀerential gradient diﬀusion
discussed in [13–17]. This mechanism has been identi-
ﬁed in a horizontal layer of pure, Boussinesq ﬂuid where
an unstable gradient of the component whose boundary
values are ﬁxed is combined with a stable stratiﬁcation
due to the ﬂux boundary conditions for another compo-
nent. It manifests itself in the form of ﬁnite-amplitude
steady ﬂows. Intensive enough to signiﬁcantly decrease
the background vertical scale of the component with ﬂux
boundary conditions, these ﬂows do not aﬀect such scale
of the component with the ﬁxed-value conditions. Not
resulting from diﬀerential diﬀusion, such ﬂows arise even
as the net background stratiﬁcation is stable. In this case

of the formulation with the ﬁxed ratio between the back-
ground gradients, they do not bifurcate from the conduc-
tion base state, as in the scenario ﬁrst proposed in [18].
An appropriate perturbation could thus trigger convec-
tion in a broad range of parameters where such convec-
tion could not have been previously anticipated.

Let the diﬀusivities of the components be equal and
let a stable stratiﬁcation due to the component with ﬂux
boundary conditions be combined with an unstable gra-
dient of the component with the ﬁxed-value conditions.
The diﬀusivities are set equal to eliminate the eﬀects of
the classical double-diﬀusion. (Equal diﬀusivities could,
besides, characterize two solutes [19].) They could also
be viewed as eddy coeﬃcients [7,9]. The background gra-
dients are represented by the Rayleigh numbers Ra =
gα|∆T |d3/κν and Ras = gβ|∂S/∂x|d4/κν ≡ µRa.

with minimal period λ = 2 for µ ∈ [0, 1.2] (P r = 6.7, Le = 1).
The background states are depicted by the horizontal lines
with arrows (for µ = 1.2, this is the coordinate axis). The
solid lines stand for the stable solutions. The dashed lines
represent the ﬂows being unstable to either steady or both
steady and oscillatory disturbances. The dotted lines stand
for the solutions being unstable to oscillatory disturbances
alone.

with k = π (λ = 2) at µ = 0.6, is not shown.] B is the
bifurcation standing for the steady linear stability boundary
for wave number k = π (λ = 2); it changes its criticality at

branches associated with the limit point, respectively. H is a
Hopf bifurcation. For µ = 1, it arises at Ra ≈ 29000.

Here, x is the (dimensional) vertical coordinate, d is the
width of the horizontal slot, ∆T is the (dimensional) dif-
ference between the values of temperature (standing for
the ﬁxed-value component, diﬀusing faster [13–17]) at the
lower and upper boundaries, ∂S/∂x is the boundaries-
prescribed (dimensional) vertical derivative of solute con-
centration (standing for the ﬂux component, diﬀusing
slower [13–17]), α is the coeﬃcient of thermal expansion,
β is the coeﬃcient of the density variation due to the vari-
ation of solute concentration, g is the gravitational accel-
eration, ν is the kinematic viscosity, and κ = κT = κS is
the diﬀusivity of both components. The bar means that
the respective variable is dimensional.

The two-dimensional conﬁguration just described is il-
lustrated in Fig. 1 as θ = 0. Using the same numer-
ical approach as in [13,15,16], this problem was stud-
ied for the periodic boundary conditions with period
λ = λ/d = 2 in the along-slot direction by continua-
tion [20] of (ﬁnite-diﬀerence) steady solutions in Ra and
µ. As in [15,16], S = 0 was set at the middle points of
the across-slot boundaries, along with the otherwise peri-
odic conditions. (Such condition is needed to specify the

scale of S and the phase of a nontrivial steady solution.)
The linear time evolution of a perturbation initially im-
posed on the steady ﬂows was computed to examine the
solution stability. The stability of the conduction base
ﬂow to steady disturbances was also analyzed for dif-
ferent wave numbers k = 2π/λ by searching for the ﬁrst
singularity of the matrix resulting from the application of
boundary conditions to the general solution of the steady,
marginal linear stability problem, as described in [14].

An inﬁnitesimal disturbance imposed on the conduc-
tion state (Fig. 1, θ = 0) would lead to the formation
of unequal perturbation gradients. The buoyancy force
resulting from the diﬀerential gradient diﬀusion in per-
turbed state is expected to act against the sense of rota-
tion of a perturbation cell [17]. This permits amplitude
growth of the perturbation cells changing their sense of
rotation with adequate frequency, as illustrated in [17] for
the inviscid ﬂuid. (As highlighted in [13,14], this eﬀect
makes the present conﬁguration, as well as the one in [17],
analogous to the diﬀusive regime of conventional double-
diﬀusive convection [10,11].) Such oscillatory instability
also arises in the viscous ﬂuid (Fig. 2), as the stable ﬂux
stratiﬁcation increases. A detailed discussion of the eﬀect
of viscosity on manifestation of the oscillatory instability
on diﬀerent scales will be reported separately.

(In the framework of current discussion, an oscillatory
perturbation could be viewed as a standing wave, i.e., as
the convective cells whose sense of rotation changes pe-
riodically in time. The prescribed across-slot-boundary
values of S can prevent traveling-wave disturbances from
being detected in the present formulation. However, trav-
eling waves are also expected to arise from such Hopf

the conduction state is allowed for [21]. Their presence,
in particular, may aﬀect the stability of steady branches
in Fig. 2.)

c(k)/(1 − µ) as µ grows from 0. [Ra0

Since the diﬀerential (gradient) diﬀusion in perturbed
state (Fig. 1, θ = 0) results in the growth of oscil-
latory inﬁnitesimal disturbances, it is expected to op-
pose growth of the small stationary perturbations. (The
sense of rotation of a stationary-perturbation cell does
not change.) Indeed, Raµ
c (k) in Fig. 3 increasingly ex-
ceeds Ra0
c(k)/(1 − µ)
are the values Raµ
c (k) would take on if both boundary
conditions were of the ﬁxed-value type.] The deviation
of Raµ
c(k)/(1 − µ) is particularly
pronounced for the large scales (small k), where diﬀusion
is most eﬀective. With respect to inﬁnitesimal steady
disturbances, therefore, ﬂux boundary conditions for the
solute stratiﬁcation stabilize the conduction state com-
pared to the single-component problem with the unstable
ﬁxed-value gradient.

c (k) in Fig. 3 from Ra0

The basic result of this work is that a novel phys-
ical mechanism due to diﬀerent boundary conditions
(Fig. 1, θ = 0) gives rise to ﬁnite-amplitude convec-
tive steady ﬂows where the conduction state is stable
to the inﬁnitesimal steady disturbances (Fig. 2). As
in convection resulting from diﬀerential gradient diﬀu-
sion [13–17], one element of this mechanism is disparate
responses of the component stratiﬁcations to convective
motion. In the present mechanism, however, the nature
of feedback to convective perturbation is identiﬁed with
ﬁnite-amplitude Rayleigh—Benard convection, which is

essentially diﬀerent from that in [13–17]. With such new
feedback, diﬀerent boundary conditions are found to re-
sult in a purely nonlinear manifestation of convection be-
ing due to the statically stable net vertical stratiﬁcation.
Finite-amplitude convective ﬂows are illustrated in
Fig.
4. As the convection amplitude increases [Fig.
4(a),(b)], the ratio of the across-slot scale of the ﬂux
component to such scale in the background state de-
creases. This is the result of an increasing number of
solute isolines moving ”outside” the ﬂow domain, espe-
cially in the regions of across-slot motion. Such behavior
is associated with the ﬂux conditions permitting solute
isolines to cross the boundaries. The respective ratio
for the ﬁxed-value component, however, remains equal
to one, even as convection becomes well-developed [Fig.
4(c),(d)]. The ﬁxed-value boundary conditions maintain
the vertical temperature scale by preventing the inter-
section of isotherms with the boundaries. They also in-
crease the thermal gradient near the wall towards which
the across-slot component of convection is directed.

The unstable density gradient thus formed in the re-
gions of across-slot motion results in a horizontal den-
sity diﬀerence between two streamline points, as in
Rayleigh—Benard convection. This provides (positive)
convective feedback that maintains the disparity between
component gradients even as the net background stratiﬁ-
cation is neutral or stable [Fig. 4(c),(d)]. In such cases of
the present formulation, linear steady instability does not
arise. As µ increases, the cells at the smaller-amplitude
branch, A1, change their form to utilize the regions with
maximal gradient disparity more eﬃciently [Fig. 4(e)].

The analogy in the physics of oscillatory instability be-
tween the present conﬁguration and the diﬀusive regime
of conventional double-diﬀusive convection [11] does not
seem to apply to ﬁnite-amplitude steady instability in
both these problems. The ﬁnite-amplitude mechanism
in [11] hinges on the disparity between component dif-
fusivities. Such a disparity makes the unstable temper-
ature gradient relatively insensitive to a convective per-
turbation, which provides the feedback maintaining con-
vection. In the present mechanism, diﬀerential gradient
diﬀusion plays only a stabilizing role as the (feedback)
unstable density stratiﬁcation arises from the interaction
of perturbation with boundary conditions.

Nonlinear Rayleigh—Benard convection also provides
feedback for the ﬁnite-amplitude steady instability in bi-
nary ﬂuid [22], if the separation ratio is negative. How-
ever, the binary-ﬂuid ﬁnite-amplitude mechanism hinges
on the dependent nature of the stabilizing background
solute gradient, rather than on boundary conditions.
Such solute gradient is thus largely destroyed when its
conduction-state relation to the unstable temperature
gradient is relaxed by a ﬁnite convective perturbation.

Let us consider an inclined slot in Fig. 1 (θ > 0) and
let µ = 1. When θ = π/2, the problem becomes identical
to that in [16] without along-slot stratiﬁcation. Finite-
amplitude ﬂows then arise due to diﬀerential gradient
diﬀusion. Such ﬂows were found to have only clockwise-
rotating cells [Fig. 3(e) in [16]]. As discussed in [16], the
emergence of the along-slot (y) gravity component intro-
duces asymmetry between the senses of rotation of the
counter-rotating convection cells as θ is increased from
0. The clockwise-rotating cells could thus be expected to
dominate the counterclockwise-rotating ones.

For large enough convection amplitudes (Ra =∼
31000, for example), however, trial computations, where
θ was the continuation parameter, failed to continuously
transform the present convective ﬂows into the above
ﬁnite-amplitude solutions at θ = π/2. The computations
also suggested the presence of a region of θ within which
diﬀerent convective steady ﬂows with period λ = 2 coex-
ist. One of these solutions was continued from θ = π/2 in
decreasing θ. It has only clockwise-rotating cells, as its
origin at θ = π/2 [16]. Another such ﬂow was continued
from θ = 0 in increasing θ. It consists of counter-rotating
cells with the clockwise-rotating cells being dominant.

For the same Ra(≈ 31000), the hysteresis phenomenon
just described was not found when θ was varied between
π and π/2, where convective ﬂows are driven only by

refers to the transformation between convective ﬂows in
the no-slip version of the slot in [13,14] (θ = π) and those
in [16] (θ = π/2). It was discussed in [16].] A detailed
analysis of the ﬂow transformations will be reported sep-
arately. Compared to θ ∈ [π/2, π], however, the failure of
the present large-amplitude solutions at θ = 0 and those
at θ = π/2 in [16] to be continuously transformed into

each other is another evidence of the physical mechanisms
generating these convective ﬂows being dissimilar.

Underlying a fundamentally new convective mecha-
nism, diﬀerent boundary conditions thus result in ﬁnite-
amplitude steady convection arising in a horizontal layer
of pure ﬂuid well before the respective linear instability.
Such nonlinear convective ﬂows also exist when the ver-
tical density stratiﬁcation is statically stable. The new
mechanism has to remain basically relevant for Le 6= 1,
as well as under stress-free boundaries and diﬀerent P r,
among other changes. It also raises the issue of three-
dimensional eﬀects. All this leads to a new perspective on
the role of convection and diﬀerent boundary conditions
in double-component ﬂuid systems, including the large-
scale systems relevant to global environmental processes.

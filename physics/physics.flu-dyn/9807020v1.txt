Stable Elliptical Vortices in a Cylindrical Geometry

(December 9, 2013)

We show that, in a two-dimensional (2d) ideal ﬂuid (also applies to a column of quasi-2d non-neutral
plasma in an axial magnetic ﬁeld), large elliptical vortices in a ﬁnite disk are stable. The stability is
established by comparison between energy of elliptical and symmetrical states to satisfy a suﬃcient
condition, without dynamical eigen-analysis. Analytical small ellipticity expansion of energy and
exact numerical values for ﬁnite ellipticity are both obtained. The expansion indicates stable linear
l = 2 diocotron modes for large vortices (or plasma columns). Numerical simulations of the 2d Euler
equation are also performed. They not only conﬁrm the suﬃcient condition, but also show that the
stability persists to smaller vortex sizes. The reason why decaying l = 2 modes were obtained by
Briggs, Daugherty, and Levy [Phys. Fluids 13, 421 (1970)] using eigen-analysis is also discussed.

The two-dimensional (2d) incompressible Euler equa-

tion

not only describes an incompressible 2d ideal ﬂuid, but
also governs the behavior of a long non-neutral plasma
column conﬁned by a uniform axial magnetic ﬁeld [1].
Here u(x, y) is the 2d velocity ﬁeld and ω(r) is the vortic-
ity ﬁeld, ω ≡ (∇×u)·ˆz. The incompressibility condition,
∇ · u = 0, can be automatically satisﬁed by deﬁning the
stream function φ as u ≡ (∂φ/∂y, −∂φ/∂x). The stream
function and vorticity are related by the Poisson equation
∇2φ = −ω. In a pure electron plasma, ω corresponds to
the electron density and φ to the electrical potential.

Stability problems of coherent vortex states in this
system are long being interesting and important ques-

liptical (Kirchoﬀ) patch solutions [2].
In a cylindrical
geometry Briggs, Daugherty, and Levy [3] showed that,
using dynamical eigen-analysis, resonance between ﬂuid
elements and wave modes will lead to damping of l ≥ 2
diocotron modes. Here l denotes the mode number as
the perturbation to a symmetric stream function is writ-
ten as φl(r) exp[i(Ωt − lθ)]. By solving the initial value
problem of linearized equations and properly treating an-
alytical continuation in complex Ω plane, they obtained
formulation for complex eigenvalue Ω. In particular, for
a vorticity distribution very close to a step function but
negative radial derivative at all places, Ω with a positive
imaginary part is calculated for l ≥ 2, leading to decaying
normal modes.

Experimental observations of decaying l = 2 modes
have been performed by Pillai and Gould [4] in a pure
electron plasma. Exponential decay rates were obtained,
as well as the observation of ﬂuid trapping in the dio-
cotron mode at large amplitudes. In another experiment
with a pure electron plasma, [5] beat-wave resonance
damping (transitions from high l modes to low l modes)
was observed to be the dominant vortex symmetrization
mechanism.

A stability argument based on global constraints has
also been applied to the 2d vortex system [6]. The logic
of this analysis is to show that a functional W [ω] which
is conserved by the 2d Euler equation is a maximum at
a particular ω(r) against all other states that are ac-
cessible under incompressible ﬂows. At this maximum,
no further changes in ω(r) are possible and the state is
then stable. For example, Davidson and Lund [7] showed
that a state in a cylindrical geometry following a relation
ω(r) = ω(φ(r)) and ∂ω(φ)/∂φ ≥ 0 is nonlinearly stable
[8].
In another example, O’Neil and Smith [9] demon-
strated that an oﬀ-center coherent vortex (linearly an
l = 1 perturbation) in a disk is also stable. However,
no results on the stability of an l = 2 mode using this
method have been given in the literatures.

Thermal equilibrium has been studied in 2d ideal ﬂuids
[10]. Since the coarse-grained entropy will not decrease
due to the dynamical vorticity mixing, it is proposed that
the system will reach a maximum coarse-grained entropy
state at long time. Mean ﬁeld equations governing these
states have been derived [10], and solutions in some situ-
ations were obtained [11]. Once a mean-ﬁeld equilibrium
state is obtained, its stability can be assured by showing
a positive second derivative of entropy against all possible
perturbations. This of course is using a similar principle
as the method mentioned above.

In this paper we establish the stability of a large ellip-
tical vortex (comparing to the system size) against relax-
ation to a symmetrical state using neither of the above
two methods with eigen-analysis and global maximum.
We will ﬁrst deduce a stable suﬃcient condition and then
show that it is satisﬁed by elliptical vortices larger than
a critical radius. The method is to compare energy of
proper states, not by evaluating second derivatives, actu-
ally not even ﬁnding any equilibrium states. We further
perform numerical simulations of the 2d Euler equation
to test our predictions. Simulations not only conﬁrm the
suﬃcient condition, but also show that elliptical vortices
are stable to lower radii.

Basic argument of the suﬃcient condition goes as:
Consider initially a uniform-vorticity elliptical vortex sit-

1

ting at the center of a unit disk, with unit vorticity level
without losing generosity. Now consider its possible dy-
namics toward an axis-symmetrical vortex. This will be
a state with a linear l = 2 diocotron mode if inﬁnitesimal
ellipticity.

The Euler equation conserves the total vorticity Q, an-
gular momentum M , and energy E of the initial ellipse,
which are given by

Q =

ω(r)dr

M =

r2ω(r)dr

Z

Z

Ee = 1

2 Z

φ(r)ω(r)dr

Furthermore, dynamical vorticity mixing ensures that
the vorticity level of the resulting symmetrical vortex will
never exceed one (the original uniform value). Under this
restriction and given Q and M from the initial ellipse,
there must be a maximum energy state with its energy
denoted as Es among all possible symmetrical distribu-
tions. With conservation of energy, this condition then
immediately follows:

Ee < Es is necessary for the ellipse to ever
evolve to a symmetrical vortex;
Ee > Es is the suﬃcient condition for the
ellipse not evolving to a symmetrical state.

Applied to inﬁnitesimal ellipticity, the l = 2 diocotron
mode will not decay when Ee > Es.

It should be noted here that this condition only try
to exclude symmetrical states from possible evolutions,
a limitation purely physically motivated. For example,
it seems unlikely that an ellipse at the disk center will
break the symmetry and relax to an oﬀ-center vortex,
although we believe that the energy of oﬀ-center vortices
could be larger than Ee. The conjecture (not decaying to
oﬀ-center states) is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations
which will be discussed later.

To test the above condition, our ﬁrst task is to calcu-
late the energy Ee of a uniform elliptical vortex, which
we deﬁne as a vorticity distribution ωe(r) in the polar
coordinate (r, θ)

ωe(r, θ; r0, ǫ) = 1 − s(r − r0(1 + ǫ cos 2θ)),

(2)

with s(x) the usual step function. The parameter r0 de-
ﬁnes a base vortex size and ǫ its ellipticity. To compute
the energy of this vortex in a unit disk, ﬁrst we consider
the Green function in a disk for the Poisson equation,
∇2G(r; r′) = −δ(r − r′), with zero boundary condition
at r = 1. Using an opposite-charged image charge sitting
at r′′ ≡ (1/r′, θ′), the Green function can be written as
G(r; r′) = − 1
2π (ln |r − r′| − ln |r − r′′| − ln r′) . The en-
ergy of the uniform elliptical vortex is then

We know of no way to integrate Eq.

Nevertheless, we can study the linear stability of an l = 2
diocotron mode from small ǫ behavior of Ee(r0, ǫ). Since
the vortex is deﬁned by r0(1 + ǫ cos 2θ), the lowest order
dependence on ǫ must be ǫ2. Correct to the order of ǫ2,
the second term in Eq. (3) is quickly found to be,

The energy Ee(r0, ǫ) is now to be compared with the
energy Es of the maximum-energy symmetrical state
with the same values of total vorticity Q and angular
momentum M . Its vorticity must also be equal or less
than one. To see what this state is, ﬁrst it is favorable to
have all the vorticity stay together, i.e., a uniform unit-
valued circular vortex with radius rs = (Q/π)1/2, to gain
as much as energy. However this circular vortex has a
ﬁxed angular momentum 1

s , and the uniform ellipse
always has a larger value. To satisfy the requirement of
both Q and M , as well as achieving a maximum energy,
the state will have a vorticity distribution ωs(r) as,

ωs(r) =

1
0

(cid:26)

for 0 < r < α & β < r < 1
for α < r < β.

(6)

Here α and β depend on Q and M , which are determined
by r0 and ǫ.
In this distribution, a certain amount of
vorticity is put as far away from center as possible, i.e.,
at the disk boundary, to account for the excess angular
momentum and maximum amount of vorticity is left to
concentrate at the center to acquire a maximum energy
[12]. Here we see how the system size comes into play
in a delicate manner. At small ǫ, α = r0

and β = 1 − 1

(It involves only straightforward algebra to solve φs and
then integrate Es.)

Evaluation of ǫ2 term reveals that there is a critical value
of r0, rc ≈ 0.586, such that Ee < Es for r0 < rc and
Ee > Es for r0 > rc.

So applying the energy condition, this indicates: the
l = 2 mode perturbation of a circular vortex in a ﬁnite
disk will not decay if the vortex is large enough (larger
than 0.586 times the disk radius). This result seems con-
tradict that of Briggs, Daugherty, and Levy [3] where
decaying modes were calculated from eigen-analysis for
all l ≥ 2 modes of a circular vortex with a smooth proﬁle
very close to ω0(r; r0) (a step at r0) but negative ω′(r)
at all r. The resolution lies at that in the calculation of
Briggs, Daugherty, and Levy, the symmetrical vortex is
assumed as a monotonic decreasing function of r. This
seems a reasonable and harmless condition. However,
as Eq. (6) shows, this condition is very restrictive and
always violated by the uniform ellipse and hence their
results no longer apply.

To further determine the stability of an ellipse with
ﬁnite ellipticity, we need go beyond the expansion and
calculate the energy for arbitrary ǫ. Here we resort

to numerical calculations of integration E = 1

Since the Green function using image charges has loga-
rithmic functions and is not easy to handle numerically,
we rewrite the Green function as a summation of Fourier
components in the azimuthal direction,

)),

with gm power ±m of both r and r′. The energy now be-
comes a summation on m of four-dimensional (r, θ, r′, θ′)
integrals. The integration on r and r′ can be carried out
analytically and the energy simpliﬁes to a summation of
double integrals on θ and θ′. The integrals are then cal-
culated numerically, and results are checked to conform
to Eq. (5) at small ǫ.

The exact value of Ee(r0, ǫ) now enable us to establish
the stability of ﬁnite ellipticity. In Figure 1 of the r0–ǫ
plane, we plot a solid line indicating the position where
Ee = Es. (Although complicated, again Es with arbi-
trary ǫ can be written down analytically from straight-
forward algebra). To the right of the line, Ee > Es and
an elliptical vortex will never relax to a symmetrical vor-
tex. The line is almost vertical and only curves a little to
the left as ǫ is increased. It crosses ǫ = 0 at r0 ≈ 0.586,
the value we have obtained from the small ǫ expansion.
To the left, the present analysis only says that the decay
to a symmetric state is allowed, but its occurrence is not
implied.

rical state if r0 > rc. It is very likely that dynamically
it will undergo adjustment and reach an elliptical-like
steady state. We cannot say about its exact distribu-
tion. Current understanding is that it probably should
be a state described by ω(r) = ω(φ(r) + Ωr2), with 2Ω
giving the rigid body rotation frequency around the disk
center. With a particular assumption on this functional
dependence, an exact distribution can then be computed.
One example is the mean ﬁeld equilibrium [10]. However,
whether and when the system will reach the prediction
from this maximum-entropy principle (thermal equilib-
rium) is still not very clear [13].

Although Eq. (2) deﬁnes a uniform vortex, we do ex-
pect that a smoothly distributed vortex should have sim-
ilar stability property if not deviated too much from Eq.
(2). The exact values of stable radii will of course be
diﬀerent. This is conﬁrmed by the numerical simulations
discussed next.

We also perform numerical simulations to test our pre-
dictions. Simulations of the Euler equation in the polar
coordinate have the diﬃculty of singularity at the origin
due to vanishing grid spacing. To avoid this singularity,
we use the functions,

x = µ

1 − ζ2/2

y = ζ

1 − µ2/2,

p

mapping a unit disk in the x–y plane to a square in µ–ζ
plane with −1 ≤ µ ≤ 1 and −1 ≤ ζ ≤ 1. The simulation
is then done in µ–ζ plane with Cartesian coordinate. The
resolution is mostly 256 × 256, with a few 512 × 512 runs
to test convergence. By avoiding the polar coordinate
and hence the singularity at the origin, we need a much
smaller numerical viscosity term, ν∇2ω, to stabilize the
simulation and hence obtain more reliable long time re-
sults. It is also noted that, since it is impossible to use
a true step vorticity distribution with ﬁnite grid points,
the simulation results should not be compared exactly
with the predictions based on Eq. (2).

So for an initial ellipse with particular values of r0 and
ǫ, we run simulations to long time and determine their ﬁ-
nal states. The results are plotted in Figure 1 as symbols,
where squares indicate relaxation to elliptical states and
solid circles to symmetrical states. Boundary region be-
tween squares and circles represents the conditions where
it is diﬃcult to determine ﬁnal states from simulations.
In the ﬁgure we see the conﬁrmation of stable elliptical
vortices with large vortex sizes. All squares to the right of
the solid line shows that simulations are consistent with
the predictions. The simulations also show that ellipses
are actually stable to a lower radius and the smallest
stable size is decreasing with increasing ǫ. Finally no
relaxations to oﬀ-center vortices ever happen.

In conclusion we have showed that, from vorticity mix-
ing in time evolution and energy calculations, large ellip-
tical vortices in a ﬁnite disk will remain stable. At the in-
ﬁnitesimal ellipticity limit, this indicates stable l = 2 dio-
cotron modes for large vortices. Numerical simulations

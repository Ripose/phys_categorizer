Abstract

In selective withdrawal, the interface between two liquid layers is deformed by an
imposed withdrawal ﬂow. A shape transition occurs at a threshold ﬂow rate that changes
the topology of the interface from a steady-state hump to an entrained spout. Near
the transition a very sharp hump tip occurs, with the minimum tip radius far smaller
than the characteristic lateral length-scale. Previous measurements [1] suggest the sharp
hump is created via an approach towards a singular steady-state shape which is cut oﬀ
at a small lengthscale. To help unfold the mechanism underlying the shape transition
and to determine the origin of the cutoﬀ lengthscale, we construct a numerical model
and compare its results against experimental measurements. The increased resolution in
the simulation enables us to identify the shape transition both in the experiment and
the numerics as a saddle-node bifurcation. The transition does not involve an approach
towards a singular shape as the hump radius never becomes much smaller than the hump
height. Results from diﬀerent boundary conditions collapse when appropriately rescaled.
The collapsed curves show that the tip curvature remains coupled to the tip height,
showing an approximately exponential dependence.

Introduction

In the ﬁeld of ﬂuid dynamics, there has always been great interest in studies of the dynamics
of liquid interfaces. A look, for example, at the breakup of a drop of one ﬂuid immersed in
another ﬂuid as it is being pulled apart by a ﬂow or pinched oﬀ through the action of surface
tension immediately hints at the richness of the underlying physics: one can observe intricate
geometrical surface shapes, small structures existing on lengthscales decades removed from
the macroscopic system size and even topological changes of the surfaces involved, for example
when a single drop breaks into multiple smaller fragments (cf.

[2, 3]).

Besides valid theoretical interests in these kinds of phenomena, an understanding of the
physics governing the behavior of ﬂuid interfaces can be of great practical importance. Appli-
cations range from combustion reactions over inkjet printing and surface coatings to a great
multitude of processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry [4, 5, 6, 7].

In their selective withdrawal experiment, Cohen and Nagel

[8, 1] study a system in which
two immiscible ﬂuids of diﬀerent density are layered vertically in a large container. The two
layers form a horizontal interface. A tube is inserted in the upper ﬂuid with its tip suspended
above the interface. When a ﬂow is induced in the system by withdrawing the upper ﬂuid
through the tube, the interface is deformed upwards. At low ﬂow rates Q, an axi-symmetric
steady-state hump with a stagnation point at the hump tip is formed. As the ﬂow rate is
increased, the tip rises higher above the neutral interface level and the curvature at the tip
increases. When Q surpasses a certain threshold Qc, the interface undergoes a transition in
which the lower ﬂuid becomes entrained in a thin axi-symmetric spout along with the upper
ﬂuid. Once the spout has formed, an increase in Q causes the spout to thicken. Cohen and
Nagel have analyzed the structure of these steady state tips near the entrainment threshold
Qc. They ﬁnd that, almost independent of material parameters such as viscosity or density
contrast, the surface shapes approach a highly curved, cusp-like conﬁguration. Eﬀects of
Marangoni stresses due to varying surfactant concentrations have been studied and ruled out
experimentally [9]. The maximum curvature observable seems to be cut oﬀ, with the cutoﬀ
tip radius roughly independent of the viscosity contrast and far smaller than characteristic
lateral length scales in the system. Their measurements suggest that the sharp hump is
created via an approach towards a steady-state singular shape. In particular, they report
that the tip curvature appears to diverge with a powerlaw exponent of
0.86 upon approach
to the threshold ﬂow rate.

−

This behavior is qualitatively very diﬀerent from what is known about drop breakup in
viscous straining ﬂows in emulsiﬁcation studies. Even though the stress balancing mech-
anisms are closely related, drops in extensional ﬂows are found to be able to sustain only
slight deformations with rounded ends when the viscosities of inner and outer ﬂuid are roughly
matched. This is contrary to the ﬁndings of Cohen and Nagel in a comparable parameter
regime. No other systems seem to be known in which surfaces deformed by viscous stresses
approach a steady-state shape singularity at ﬁnite ﬂow rates without taking certain dimen-
sionless quantities such as the viscosity ratio to a singular limit.

Lister has studied selective withdrawal from a two-layer system in the matched viscosity
regime numerically [10]. His focus, however, was on the role of surface tension versus gravity
as a stabilizing mechanism. He found that for systems of miscible ﬂuids, which play an
important role in geological contexts, the lack of surface tension leads to entrainment of the
lower ﬂuid for all ﬂow rates, with no steady-state hump shapes possible. He does not seem
to study the details of the the entrainment transition for systems with surface tension.

In the present work, we investigate the properties of the selective withdrawal system in
the vicinity of the steady-state tip/entrained spout transition. Using a boundary integral
simulation of the ﬂows, we set up a simpliﬁed numerical model of the hump state and use
this to study the system below and close to the entrainment threshold.

2 Background

A shape transition analogous to the selective withdrawal transition occurs when a liquid
drop is emulsiﬁed into several drops by a straining ﬂow. Taylor’s 1934 pioneering study
[11] investigated how the threshold strain rate and threshold shape change as the viscosity
contrast is varied.

When the viscosity of the drop, µ0, is equal to that of the ambient liquid, µ, the threshold
shape is a slightly deformed sphere. For µ0
µ, on the other hand, the threshold shape is
≪
a long slender drop with conical tips. Subsequent long-wavelength analyses and experiments
show that in this limit the aspect ratio of the threshold shape scales as √λ, where λ is the

viscosity ratio µ0/µ [12, 13, 14]. In addition, the long-wavelength analyses show the bursting
apart of the drop corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation [15] in the steady-state shape.
Below the threshold strain rate two steady-state drop shapes exist, one linearly stable and one
linearly unstable. Above the threshold strain rate, no steady-state drop shape is possible. At
the threshold strain rate, the unstable and stable shapes coincide and annihilate each other.
This is illustrated in ﬁgure 1, which plots the length L of the steady-state drop as a function
of the dimensionless strain rate Ca. The capillary number is deﬁned as Ca = µEa/γ, where
E is the dimensional imposed strain rate, a the radius of the undisturbed drop and γ surface
tension. The most generic way for the two branches to merge smoothly at Cac is to form
a horizontal parabola centered at (Cac, Lc), where Cac is the dimensionless threshold strain
rate and Lc is the threshold drop length. Consequently, the drop length of the stable shape
Ca. To see why a stable and an unstable drop
near Cac scales like Lc −
shape coexist below Cac, suppose the stable drop is slightly elongated along the extensional
axis of the ﬂow. For a ﬁnite elongation, we expect that the drop relaxes back to the stable
shape if the elongation is suﬃciently small. Since the axial velocity increases along the
extensional axis, a larger elongation will cause the drop to extend indeﬁnitely. Therefore it is
reasonable to expect an unstable steady-state drop shape to exist below Cac. This unstable
shape divides shape perturbations that relax back to the stable steady-state drop and those
that cause the drop to burst.

While the long-wavelength analysis gives no information on how the tip curvature κ
evolves as a function of Ca, both experiments and numerics show that it increases dramati-
cally as Ca approaches Cac [16, 17]. For more moderate viscosity ratios λ
1, in which the
tip curvature of the threshold drop shape κc remains on the order of the drop size, numerics
show that both the drop length and the tip curvature undergo a saddle-node bifurcation
[18, 19, 20, 21].

≈

More information about the transition dynamics of an interface developing a region with
large curvature exists in studies of air entrainment. This is an analogous 2D shape transition
with µ0
µ. When µ0 = 0, asymptotic analysis and analytic solution show that a steady-
state interface exists for all Ca [22, 23]. A true cusp is created only at inﬁnite ﬂow rate. More
precisely, as Ca increases, the tip height approaches a ﬁnite value whereas the tip curvature
grows as e32πCa. For ﬁnite µ0, analysis and experiments [24, 25] show that this unbounded
growth of tip curvature is cut oﬀ at a small lengthscale which is a fraction of the tip height,

≪

with the fraction scaling as λ4/3.

p

Taken together these studies suggest that a separation of lengthscales for the threshold
in the case of an extended drop, is achieved only
interface shape, for example κcLc → ∞
when µ0 is vanishingly small compared to µ. Recent selective withdrawal experiments appear
to contradict these conclusions from previous studies
[1, 8]. Threshold measurements are
consistent with an interpretation that the steady-state threshold interface attains a nearly
singular shape for all viscosity contrasts. The cutoﬀ lengthscale varies little as the viscosity
contrast is changed, but instead shows a stronger dependence on the capillary lengthscale
γ/∆ρg where ∆ρ is the density contrast between top and bottom ﬂuid and g is
lc =
gravitational acceleration. Since lc is the characteristic lateral lengthscale above which the
deformed interface ﬂattens out due to gravity, the dependence of the cut oﬀ lengthscale
on lc suggests that the observed separation of lengthscales can be attributed to boundary
conditions on the interface at large lengthscales instead of the viscosity contrast. This view is
supported by a recent analysis of steady-state spout formation at µ0
µ. Vanishingly thin
spouts, corresponding to a complete separation of lengthscales in the long-wavelength model,
are created when appropriate boundary conditions are prescribed at the base of the spout
[26]. If this strong dependence on boundary conditions persists as µ0/µ increases towards
1, an assumption that appears to be supported by results from the selective withdrawal
experiment, then it may be possible to create a nearly singular threshold hump shape at
µ0 = µ. To test this possibility, we construct a numerical model of the selective withdrawal
system and analyze the dynamics near the entrainment transition and its dependence on
boundary conditions.

3 Modeling selective withdrawal

Figure 2 shows a schematic of the selective withdrawal experiment: a cylindrical pipe is
suspended over the horizontal interface between two ﬂuids. The upper ﬂuid is withdrawn
through the pipe, creating a converging ﬂow that deforms the free surface. A box is drawn
around the region of signiﬁcant interface deformation and the approximate shape of ﬂow lines
in the system is indicated.

In order to simulate this system numerically, we use the setup illustrated in ﬁgure 3. In
our formulation, the ﬂuid interface SI between ﬂuids 1 and 2 is held pinned at a ﬁxed radius
a. An inﬁnite reservoir below the interface is imitated by holding the pinning plane SR at a
constant pressure p0. Fluid 1 is allowed to pass through SR freely. Above the interface, a point
sink is placed at distance S from SR. The ambient ﬂuid far from the setup is assumed to be
quiescent. An axi-symmetric coordinate system as indicated in the ﬁgure is used throughout
this study. In the low Reynolds-number limit ﬂuid inertia becomes negligible and the ﬂows
in the system are governed by the Stokes equation for Newtonian incompressible ﬂuids:

ui = 0

∇ ·

(i=1,2), where ui is the velocity ﬁeld, pi is the pressure, µi is the viscosity and σi is the
rate-of-strain ﬁeld of the respective ﬂuid.

Fluid 1 is bounded by its interface with ﬂuid 2, SI , and the constant pressure reservoir
surface SR. The boundary condition imposed on SR is that of a constant normal stress jump
of size p0:

In the experimental setup used by Cohen and Nagel, the capillary length in the system
[1] was approximately 0.3cm, much larger than the small-scale structure found near the
transition (tip radius of the order of 100µm). As mentioned in chapter 2, it is therefore
believed that the main role of gravity is to set the boundary condition of an overall ﬂat
shape of the interface. Without an external ﬂow, the interface will assume a ﬂat horizontal
shape (except for meniscus eﬀects near the container walls) and is linearly stable against
perturbations from this conﬁguration.
In our setup, a similar role is played by the inﬁnite reservoir pressure p0. p0 selects the
(linearly stable) interface shape when no external ﬂow is present: a spherical cap of radius
2/p0 (in non-dimensional units) cut oﬀ at the pinning radius a = 1. A completely ﬂat interface
corresponds to a reservoir pressure p0 = 0.

To see how this boundary condition connects with the experiment, consider that in the
experiment, the vanishing of the steady-state hump and subsequent entrainment of a spout
is caused by viscous stresses overcoming surface tension at the tip of the hump. The radial
extent of the hump is set by the smaller one of either the straw height or the capillary
lengthscale. Away from this hump region, the interface assumes an almost ﬂat shape, causing
the ﬂow to be nearly radial in direction. Therefore, viscous stresses should not contribute
appreciably to the normal stress balance on the ﬂat interface, which then is dominated by
gravity. This makes the ﬂat interface a surface of almost constant pressure.

For numerical reasons, it is simpler (however not strictly necessary) to work with a small
but non-zero pressure. For most runs shown in this paper, p0 was chosen to be 0.01. A
check against the p0 = 0 result showed that relative changes in the results (tip curvature,
tip height, critical ﬂow rate) are generally smaller than 10−2. The governing equations are
non-dimensionalized by using the pinning radius a as the characteristic lengthscale and the
viscous relaxation velocity γ/µ as the characterstic velocity scale. With the characteristic
timescale µa/γ, the nondimensional sink ﬂow rate then is

A ﬂow rate Q = O(1) corresponds to a sink producing viscous stresses at distance a that are
of the same order as surface tension stresses of a drop of radius a.

Because solutions to the Stokes equation can be formulated in terms of Greens functions, we

In this context, following the notation used in the experiment, λ is deﬁned as the ratio of
the viscosity of the lower ﬂuid over that of the upper ﬂuid: λ = µ1
µ2 . In equation (6), the
ﬁrst term on the right hand side describes the ﬂow contributions from surface tension forces
along the liquid-liquid interface, whereas the second term accounts for diﬀerent shear rates
in the two liquids. This term vanishes when λ = 1. The third and fourth term contain the
ﬂow contributions from the (constant) normal stress forcing and the shear rates along the
constant pressure reservoir surface, respectively. The last term incorporates the eﬀects of the
imposed outside ﬂow.

In order to solve for the evolution of the liquid interfaces via the creeping ﬂow equations, a
C++ code has been set up that makes use of the boundary integral equations for Stokes ﬂow
in an axi-symmetric setting. Because of the symmetry of the problem, all surfaces involved
coordinates
can be represented as eﬀectively one-dimensional objects by their r- and z
in a cylindrical coordinate system. This allows for much greater resolution than a three-
dimensional description at lower computational cost.

−

The liquid interface is parameterized by mesh points ri (si) , zi (si), where si denotes
the arclength along the surface measured from the tip. The interface between mesh points is
approximated by a cubic spline. This way, the curvature calculated for the Laplace pressure
term varies continuously between mesh points. The distribution and number of points is
adapted to the geometric shape of the surface. The algorithm we implemented chooses the
density of points to be proportional to the mean curvature (in most runs ∆s = 0.05/κm,
where ∆s is the arclength between two adjacent mesh points and κm is the mean curvature).
Additionally, a maximum distance between mesh points cannot be exceeded. For most runs,
this value was chosen to be of the order of 1/20 in dimensionless units. Since we start with

7

an almost ﬂat interface, this means that the initial shape is represented by 20 grid points.
During a typical run, the number of mesh points on the interface is dynamically increased
to about 60 in order to resolve a tip curvature of approximately 75. An increase in the mesh
resolutions shows no signiﬁcant change in the results.

The constant pressure reservoir surface in the setup and the nozzle sidewalls (for the solid
container runs) are represented by a uniform grid of points. The velocity (in the case of a
constant pressure surface) and normal stress jump (in the case of a solid wall) between points
are interpolated linearly. The constant pressure reservoir surface in the setup is represented by
a mesh of 30 uniformly spaced points. The boundary integrals are evaluated using Gaussian
quadratures. Singular parts of the integral are dealt with separately using ﬁner subdivisions
of the integration interval, and the resulting algebraic equations for the unknown velocities
and stresses are solved by LU decomposition.

The azimuthal component of the boundary integral equations is integrated analytically,

the resulting elliptic integrals evaluated numerically (see [27]).

The mesh points on the interface are advanced in time normal to the surface using ex-
plicit forward Euler timestepping. The length of each timestep is chosen proportional to
the smallest mesh spacing. The validity of this approach was tested by doubling the time
resolution for a given run and comparing to the original results. Generally, results obtained
this way diﬀered by less than 1%. We also experimented with an implicit backward Euler
scheme, but the evaluation of the necessary Jacobian was prohibitively slow, and the re-
sults obtained by the two methods did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, since we are
evolving towards steady state conﬁgurations, details of the intermediate dynamics are only
of secondary interest.

The scheme for ﬁnding steady state shapes and critical ﬂow rates follows the experimental
procedure [28]: starting with a static conﬁguration at zero ﬂow rate, Q is increased in small
steps and for each step the interface is allowed to relax into a steady state shape. Steady state
is detected by observing that the modulus of the highest normal velocity on the interface,
n, falls below a certain threshold (10−3 in dimensionless velocity units in most cases;
umax
lower thresholds were tested without signiﬁcantly changing the results). When umax increases
monotonically by a certain factor, we deduce that a steady-state hump shape has ceased to
exist. In this case, the interval between the last steady state ﬂow rate and the current ﬂow
rate is divided in half, creating nesting intervals containing the critical ﬂow rate Qc. This
procedure is stopped when the interval size drops below the desired accuracy.

·

5 Dynamics near the transition

In chapter 2 we argued that the bursting of a drop in an extensional ﬂow corresponds to a
saddle-node bifurcation, because the imposed ﬂow speeds up along the extensional axis. Since
an analogous speeding up of the imposed ﬂow occurs in the selective withdrawal system, we
expect the steady-state hump shape to vanish via a saddle-node bifurcation, as illustrated
in ﬁgure 4. Similar to the drop situation, an unstable steady-state interface shape separates
perturbations of the stable shape which collapse back to the stable shape from those which
get pulled towards the sink by the speeding up of the external ﬂow.

Steady-state interface shapes at zero, moderate and threshold ﬂow rates are shown in
ﬁgure 5. For this typical run, the reservoir pressure is held at p0 = 0.2 and the sink is located
at distance 1 above the reservoir 1. The Q = 0 interface is a spherical cap with its curvature
determined by the reservoir pressure. At Q = 2, a broad hump develops on the interface.
The volume between the backsurface and the interface has increased signiﬁcantly. At the
1A relatively high reservoir pressure p0 = 0.2 is chosen here to make the initial interface shape more visible

entrainment threshold (Q = 2.80415), the interface forms a distinct hump directly below the
sink, which broadens away from the sink to smoothly join onto the pinned edge. Just above
the entrainment threshold, at Q = 2.80416, no steady-state hump exists. Instead, the tip of
the hump sharpens and extends towards the sink over time (inset of ﬁgure 5). Notice that
while the steady-state hump radius can be much smaller than the pinning radius, it does not
become much smaller than the hump height. As will be shown, changing p0 or the sink height
S leads to no changes in the qualitative features of the interface evolution described above.
Next, we analyze the evolution of the steady-state hump shape in detail. In ﬁgure 6 the
height h of the hump over the constant pressure reservoir surface in steady-state for diﬀerent
ﬂow rates Q is shown for a typical run with p0 = 0.01 and S = 0.2. As consistent with a
saddle-node bifurcation, h approaches its saturation value hc along a half-parabola as the
ﬂow rate Q approaches the threshold value Qc. The inset shows that (hc −
h)/hc scales as a
Q)/Qc throughout the entire range of Q. The range of possible values
square root of (Qc −
for Qc is strongly limited by our interval bisection method used to ﬁnd steady-state shapes,
since Qc must lie between the largest Q that still gives rise to a steady-state hump and the
smallest Q which, starting from a lower ﬂow rate, results in a spout being entrained into the
sink. We can use the size of this last interval as a rough estimate for the expected error in
Qc. With the prefactor of the 1/2-powerlaw we can then propagate the estimated error in Qc
to hc and compare this to the values of hc from the ﬁt and the value of h for the last stable
steady-state found numerically. These values are found to be consistent with each other.

Since both the largest lengthscale h and the smallest lengthscale 1/κ undergo a saddle-
node bifurcation, we conclude that the steady-state hump vanishes via a saddle-node bifur-
cation. To get a more detailed view of how the shape evolves near Qc, we analyze how the
half-width and the half-height of the interface approach their threshold values. The diﬀerence
Q)/Qc
between the half-width r(z = hmax/2) and its threshold value again scales as
(see ﬁgure 8), whereas the half-height h(r = 1/2) approaches its threshold value almost lin-
Q)/Qc. Only near the tip region, that is h(r) for r < 1/κ, does the hump height
early in (Qc −
exhibit square root scaling. This shows that the dominant surface mode which becomes un-
stable at the threshold ﬂow rate and undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation corresponds to a
mostly radial adjustment of the entire shape and an axial adjustment in the tip region.

To further study the impact of boundary conditions on the observed transition, we tested
the robustness of the saddle-node scaling near the transition by implementing diﬀerent sets
of boundary conditions.

This is illustrated in ﬁgure 9. Part (a) shows a setup in which a container with solid walls
holding the bottom ﬂuid is simulated. Part (b) shows a setup in which the constant pressure
reservoir surface is replaced by a no-slip surface. This corresponds to a drop on a solid plate,
with its edges pinned at radius a. In both cases, typical sequences of surface shapes show
the interface at zero, intermediate and threshold ﬂow rates, similar to ﬁgure 5. The initial
volume of ﬂuid for the solid backsurface run was given by a spherical cap of radius 20 and the
sink was placed at S = 0.2. For the solid container, the sink was placed at a height S = 0.5
above the interface.

For the interface pinned atop the container (part a), we start out with a ﬂat interface.
The interface develops into a distinctive hump below the sink at threshold ﬂow rate. Because
the interface is held ﬁxed at the edge and since volume is conserved in this setup, the shape
shows a small dip below the neutral level between the hump and the pinning edge. This dip

compensates for the volume of ﬂuid forming the hump. In the case of the interface pinned
on a solid plate, the shape evolves into a hump containing the bulk of the ﬂuid centered
under the sink. The base of the hump spans roughly half of the pinning radius. Since volume
is conserved and the interface is pinned at the edge, this results in an almost ﬂat interface
between the pinning site and the cone base.

particular, the tip curvature in these two cases also saturates upon approach to the threshold
ﬂow rate, indicating that the entire interface shape undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation.

In addition, we have repeated this analysis for various runs with diﬀerent sink heights,
back pressures and types of backsurfaces, and ﬁnd that the hump always disappears via a
saddle-node bifurcation.

Since our numerical system is an idealized model of the hump tip that does not incorporate
eﬀects of gravity or the exact ﬂow geometry of the straw, we do not expect a one-to-one match
of numerical values such as threshold ﬂow rates, hump heights, et cetera.

and Nagel, typically by around 5%. Notice that the range in (Qc −
data is considerably larger than that of the experiment. We conclude that the measured
evolution of the hump heights also shows a saddle-node bifurcation near the transition.

Next we re-examine whether the measured tip curvature diverges near the transition. In
order to compare the experimental measurements and the numerical results, we rescale the
tip curvature by the threshold hump height hc. We plot the rescaled tip curvature versus
the rescaled ﬂow rate for various experimental runs as well as our numerical data in ﬁgure
12. The Qc values obtained from the scaling analysis of the hump height are used (see ﬁgure
11). The graph shows that the experimental data falls on top of the numerical results, even
though the curvature is still approaching its saturation value. The good agreement strongly
suggests that the tip curvature in the experiment also undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation.
Compared with the hump height, the tip curvature shows evidence of saturation towards
a ﬁnal value only when Q is very close to Qc. As a consequence, as the entrainment threshold
is approached, the tip curvature can appear to diverge while the hump height reaches a
Q)/Qc,
saturation value. In particular, when κ is plotted against (Qc −
it is very diﬃcult to distinguish between a continued power law and a turn over into saturation
with the available range of experimental data. This is because even a slight shift in the value
of Qc can straighten out the curves. The powerlaw behavior in the (Qc −
Q)/Q range between
1 and 10−2 seems to be mainly caused by the fact that in this range, the denominator of
Q) /Q is always close to Qc and almost constant, thus the entire expression scales
(Qc −
roughly like 1/Q. Furthermore, for small ﬂow rates Q the system response to the outside
ﬂow can be assumed to be almost linear, with a linear dependence of κ on Q. This would
then asymptotically give rise to a powerlaw with an exponent of

Q)/Q instead of (Qc −

6 Dynamics over the entire range of ﬂow rates

So far, we have explored the evolution of the interface near the threshold ﬂow rate Qc. Next,
we will look at the coupling between the tip curvature and the hump height over the entire
range of ﬂow rates. In ﬁgure 13, the dependence of the steady-state tip curvature κ on the
hump height h is illustrated in a semi-log plot. Both quantities are non-dimensionalized using
the threshold hump height hc. Each point corresponds to a steady-state interface shape for
a given ﬂow rate Q. For small Q, and hence small h, the tip curvature increases very quickly
with the hump height. This steep rise is then followed by an almost exponential dependence
of κ on h. As h saturates, the increase in κ also saturates at a ﬁnite value. The separation
κc = hc/Rtip, can be read oﬀ the
of the two lengthscales at the entrainment threshold, hc ·
right-most point in the graph to be of the order of 7. As Q increases, the hump radius
decreases from initial values which are far larger than the hump height and attains a value
that is a ﬁnite fraction of the hump height at Qc. In the experiments, the threshold hump
radii range from about 1/5 to 1/14 of the threshold hump height. As in the simulation, the
two lengthscales are not well separated. If one deﬁnes an equivalent ratio for equal viscosity
drop breakup by using the tip curvature versus the half-length of the drop, one ﬁnds a value
of 3. Thus the numerical model produces a separation of lengthscales that is only about a
factor 2 larger than in the drop breakup case. Clearly, this diﬀerence is small enough to be
attributed to the change in overall geometry between the two situations.

We examine how the separation of lengthscales changes for diﬀerent boundary conditions.

limit of S

that for large S, the ﬂow at the interface is almost uniform on the scale of the pinning radius
a. In the other limit of S
a, the tip radius 1/κ and the hump height become proportional
to the sink height. This is indicative of the fact that in this limit the sink height S becomes
the only relevant lengthscale in the system, and the eﬀects of holding the interface pinned at
radius a vanish. By rescaling all lengths in the system by the sink height S, the dependence

of the hump height and tip curvature vanish trivially in this case. Consequently, κc ·

Finally, even replacing the backsurface with a solid plate or with a container, as was done
in the previous chapter, see ﬁgure 9, does not lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the separation
of lengthscales. In contrast to the strong dependence on boundary conditions found in the
long-wavelength model for steady-state spout shapes with µ0
µ, the µ0 = µ simulation
here suggests that the separation of lengthscales at threshold only has a weak dependence
on the boundary conditions. Further work on selective withdrawal at unequal viscosities is
needed to resolve this discrepancy.
While the saturation of hc·

κc is consistent with previous results on drop emulsiﬁcation, the
strong, almost exponential, dependence of the tip curvature on the hump height is surprising,
since the velocity ﬁeld near the hump tip varies smoothly with distance from the tip. To see
whether the striking sensitivity of the tip curvature to the height of the hump is a robust

where the ﬂow in the upper ﬂuid is driven by a vortex ring and a sink. The ﬁnal set has the
sink height at S = 0.2, but replaces the constant pressure backsurface by a solid plate (X).
Remarkably all these diﬀerent runs show a strong, approximately exponential dependence.
Although the interface shape, in particular the actual values of the tip curvature and hump
height, varied signiﬁcantly among these diﬀerent runs, the rescaling almost entirely collapses
the diﬀerent curves. Only the solid plate run produces a curve with a distinctively smaller
slope. When the experimental data are rescaled in the described way, the curves roughly
collapse onto one curve, except for S = 0.8295cm, as shown in ﬁgure 16. As can be expected
from the collapse of diﬀerent numerical solutions, the collapsed experimental curve lies close
to the numerical curve. As S increases, the experimental curves show a more and more
pronounced upturn near hc. Probable mechanisms for this discrepancy are inertia of ﬂow in
the upper ﬂuid, or ﬂattening of the interface away from the hump due to gravity. These two
eﬀects should become more pronounced as S increases.

To summarize, both the experimental selective withdrawal system and the numerical
simulations with varying boundary conditions show that the hump radius never becomes
much smaller than the hump height. In all these situations, a roughly exponential dependence
of the tip curvature on the hump is found. Currently, there is no straight forward argument
for why the tip curvature should have such a strong dependence on the hump height.

7 Conclusions

In this study, we constructed a simpliﬁed numerical model of the selective withdrawal exper-
iment for two ﬂuids of equal viscosity.

In our setup, we ﬁnd that steady-state humps exist up to a threshold sink ﬂow rate Qc.
Above this threshold, no steady-state surface shapes are found, the interface is drawn into
the sink instead.

We analyze how the interface approaches its critical shape near the transition and ﬁnd that
the system goes through a saddle-node bifurcation. This kind of scaling has been observed
previously in drop breakup studies, in which the same stress balancing mechanisms describe
topological transitions of interfaces in viscous ﬂows. We were able to compare our numerical
results to experimental data in a similar parameter regime and ﬁnd that the two sets are
consistent with each other. The experimental data can also be interpreted in the context of a

We also analyzed how the hump height and the tip curvature, two lengthscales chosen
dynamically by the system, vary in the entire range of ﬂow rates. We compare results from a
number of diﬀerent setups as well as the experiment. The hump radius never becomes much
smaller than the hump height. The absolute size of these two lengths is found to be set by
the smallest length scale in the system, which is given in the simpliﬁed numerical model by
the distance of the sink to the unperturbed interface. In addition, we discovered that the tip
radius shows a strong, almost exponential dependence on the hump height.

A natural way to extend this study would be to investigate the inﬂuence of the viscosity
ratio λ on the results found. In drop emulsiﬁcation, steady-state drop shapes depend strongly
on λ. While long and slender drops with highly curved tips are produced in the limit λ
1,
only slight distortions from a sphere in the steady-state shape of the drop can be sustained
when λ
In contrast, selective withdrawal experiments report threshold shapes with
essentially the same separation of lengthscales, regardless of the viscosity contrast [1, 8, 29].
This suggests that the minimum size of a steady-state spout may also be relatively insensitive
to the viscosity ratio. At this point, it is not clear how much of the discrepancy between the
emulsiﬁcation and the selective withdrawal experiments is due to the fact that the selective
withdrawal results were analyzed in terms of singularity formation. We have shown that this

with the viscosity contrast. While our work has shown that the entrainment transition with
equal viscosity layers does not involve convergence towards a steady-state singular shape,
it remains unclear whether such a convergence can occur when the two layers have very
dissimilar viscosities. Previous analyses, either of the 2D transition via conformal mapping
techniques or of the 3D transition via long-wavelength models, have shown that the interface
at transition approaches a singular shape as the viscosity of the entrained ﬂuid becomes
smaller and smaller relative to the viscosity of the entraining ﬂuid. Therefore, it remains
possible that the scaling analysis performed by Cohen and Nagel may be appropriate in the
limit of extremely diﬀerent viscosities. No analysis has considered whether a nearly singular
shape can be formed when the entrained ﬂuid is much more viscous than the entraining ﬂuid,
[29]. Extending the
but recent experiments appear to suggest this may also be possible
simulation to layers with diﬀerent viscosities would clear up many of these ambiguities. If
there is a strong dependence on the viscosity contrast, this work could shed light on how
viscous ﬂow eﬀects and the reservoir conditions can work together to create nearly-singular
steady-state structures. Furthermore, if an approach to nearly-singular shapes occurs, the

20

numerics could help to determine whether the cutoﬀ of the tip curvature is caused by the
viscosity of the lower ﬂuid, as has been proposed in the 2D case [23], whether the cutoﬀ
is tunable via boundary conditions, as is the case for the long wavelength-model of viscous
entrainment [26], or whether entirely diﬀerent eﬀects come into play in this situation.

A prominent feature of the proposed transition mechanism via a saddle-node bifurcation
is the vanishing of the stable steady-state solution as it coincides with the unstable steady-
state solution at the transition point. Due to the unstable nature of this second solution,
it is not possible to observe its shape directly in the experiment. Using Newton-relaxation
techniques it might be possible to study this class of solutions in the equal viscosity regime
numerically to provide further insight into the curvature cutoﬀ.

The selective withdrawal experiment has shown that above the transition, entrained
spouts are produced instead of steady-state humps. One possible way to model the for-
mation of a steady-state spout is by using a vortex-ring to drive the external ﬂow at the
upper edge of the simulation domain, and then imposing periodic boundary conditions on
the spout surface at that boundary. This would enable us to study the entrainment transition
approaching the critical ﬂow rate from above and below.

So far, no systematic measurements of the spout thickness exist. This is because the spout
thickness decreases along its length and the spout shape changes everywhere as the imposed
ﬂow rate changes. Thus, from shape data alone, it is unclear how to measure the spout
thickness in a way that allows experiments with diﬀerent liquids at diﬀerent ﬂow rates to be
compared meaningfully. However, as noted in
[26], when the entrained spout is thin, the
ﬂow pattern in the lower layer is not disturbed signiﬁcantly. As a consequence, one sensible
way to characterize the spout thickness is to measure the spout radius at the stagnation point
of the lower layer velocity ﬁeld. This is an expensive procedure for experiments, but not for
numerics.

With the higher resolution of the numerical model, it would also be possible to probe the
existence of hysteresis in the hump-spout transition. If the collapse of a spout back to a hump
occurs at a lower ﬂow rate than the vanishing of the hump in the saddle-node bifurcation,
the minimum spout thickness would be smaller than the hump-tip radius at the entrainment
threshold. This is of great interest for technological applications such as the manufacture of
optical ﬁbers or compound ﬁbers, where the minimum achieveable spout size is an important
quantity.

Finally, so far we have focused on the dynamics of clean interfaces.

In practice it is
diﬃcult to avoid the presence of surface contaminants. In emulsiﬁcation studies, thin threads
that subsequently break up into small droplets were found to form at the poles of stretched
out drops [11] in extensional ﬂows. This phenomenon of tip streaming was later shown to
be caused by gradients in the surfactant concentration on the liquid interface [30, 31]. In
the selective withdrawal experiments, great care was to taken to obtain results with clean
interfaces. It might, however, be worthwhile to incorporate surfactant eﬀects in our numerical
model in order to study the eﬀects of Marangoni stresses on the selective withdrawal transition
and the cutoﬀ tip curvatures and surface shapes.

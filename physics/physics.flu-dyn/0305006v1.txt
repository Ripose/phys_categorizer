Abstract

Two paradoxical aspects of the prevailing kinetic equations are pre-
sented. One is related to the usual understanding of distribution function
and the other to the usual understanding of the phase space. With help of
simple counterexamples and direct analyses, involved paradoxes manifest
themselves.

PACS number: 51.10.+y.

When the Boltzmann equation, thought of as the ﬁrst equation of the prevail-
ing kinetic theory, came out, strong doubts arose, of which many were related
to the fact that whereas Newton’s equations themselves were time-reversible
the Boltzmann equation, as a consequence of Newton’s equations, was time-
irreversible[1]. As time went by, particularly after the “rigorous” BBGKY the-
ory was formulated in the middle of the last century[2−8], the philosophical
concern of the time-reversal paradox gradually faded out, and it was believed
that the ultimate understanding of the related issues had been completely es-
tablished, at least in the regime of classical mechanics.

However, relatively recent developments of mathematics and physics seem
to have brought new elements into the picture.
In particular, the studies of
fractals[9, 10] reveal that there can, at least in the mathematical sense, exist
functions that have structures of self-similarity even at the inﬁnitesimal level.
Such functions are intrinsically discontinuous and cannot be described by usual
diﬀerential apparatuses. Along this line, an increasing number of scientists are
surmising that if any similar structures are found in realistic gases, some of
conventional concepts in the standard theory need to be revised signiﬁcantly.

In connection with this, we wish to present and discuss two relatively un-
known aspects of the standard framework of kinetic theory. Firstly, it will be

1

shown that a realistic gas contains, almost always, a signiﬁcant amount of par-
ticles whose distribution function does not keep invariant in the six-dimensional
phase space and cannot be regarded as a continuous one. Secondly, it will be
illustrated that there are inherent diﬃculties in formulating the particles that
enter and leave an inﬁnitesimal phase volume element during an inﬁnitesimal
time, which suggests in the sense that the phase space is more sophisticated
than the customary thought assumes. By removing abstractness of the matters,
all related paradoxes become surprisingly simple and straightforward. We are
now convinced that if those paradoxes had been unveiled at the very berginning,
kinetic theory would have been renewed several times.

The basic core of the classical kinetic theory says that if particles of a gas do
not interact with each other, the distribution function describing them satisﬁes
the collisionless Boltzmann equation

which is, according to well-known textbooks[11, 12], equivalent to the path-
invariance of collisionless distribution function

where the subindexes r(t) and v(t) imply that that the diﬀerentiation is taken
along a particle’s path. Conceptually speaking, equation (2) can be interpreted
as saying that such a gas is “incompressible” in the phase space. The standard
theory further states that, if collisions between particles are more than negli-
gible, a certain type of collisional operator needs to be introduced to replace
the zero term in (1). After having the collisional operator due to Boltzmann
himself, equation (1) becomes

where the ﬁrst term on the right side represents particles entering the unit phase
volume element and the second term particles leaving the unit phase volume
element.

Although the formulation briefed in the last paragraph seems stringent and
has been accepted unanimously in the community, it is not truly sound. Ironi-
cally enough, even a simple glance at the form of the Boltzmann equation (3)
oﬀers intriguing things to ponder. On the left side there is a symmetry between
r and v in terms of diﬀerentiation operation; whereas on the right side the po-
sition vector r serves as an inactive “parameter” and all the integral operations
are performed in the velocity space. (The solid angle Ω is deﬁned in terms of
the velocities.) This disparity, while seeming a bit too schematic to be fully

2

convincing, should serve a motivation for us to investigate the whole issue more
carefully and more thoroughly.

We ﬁrst look at whether or not the collisionless Boltzmann equation (1) and

the path-invariance theorem (2) make sense as they intend to.

In the mathematical sense, the picture provided by the path-invariance is

quite clear and simple. Consider a suﬃciently small volume element

∆x∆y∆z∆vx∆vy∆vz

(4)

moving together with a certain particle in the phase space; the theorem asserts
that the particle density within the element (in number herein) does not increase
or decrease. In well-known textbooks, the theorem is “proved” by applying the
rigorous Jacobian approach[11−13]. Here, for the purpose of this paper, we
wish to illustrate the theorem and its derivation in an intuitive way. Fig. 1 de-
scribes what takes place in the two-dimensional x-vx subspace. As time passes
from t = 0 to t = T , the particles distributed inside the rectangle ∆x∆vx in
Fig. 1a will be distributed inside the parallelogram in Fig. 1b. By excluding all
external forces (just for simplicity), it is obvious that the area of the parallel-
ogram is equal to that of the rectangle and the average particle density within
the moving volume element keeps invariant. On the understanding that parti-
cles distribute continuously within ∆x∆vx and the size of ∆x∆vx can shrink to
zero, the invariance of the average particle density can certainly be interpreted
as the path-invariance of distribution function. The discussion above, though
simpliﬁed somewhat, reﬂects the essence of the full theorem accurately.

It seems, at this stage, that the validity of the path-invariance (2), together
with the picture of incompressible ﬂuid in the phase space, is so solid and so clear
that we should discuss it no more. But, somehow, the truth is not that simple:
there exist many cases in that gases behave very diﬀerently. To get an immediate
idea about such behavior, let’s look at the special arrangement shown in Fig. 2,
where particles with deﬁnite velocity v strike a convex solid surface and then
get reﬂected from it elastically. (Later on, more general models about collisions
between particles and boundaries will be adopted and examined.) Following a
moving particle and counting particles in a deﬁnite position range dr ≡ dxdydz
and in a deﬁnite velocity range dv ≡ dvxdvydvz, we ﬁnd out a clear-cut fact
that the reﬂected particles simply obey

That is to say, these particles diverge in the phase space. In a similar way, we
can readily see that if the incident particles fall upon a concave solid surface,
the reﬂected particles will, in some region, obey

This tells us that the particles converge.

A sharp question arises. How can the path-invariance theorem, considered
as the very core of all the kinetic equations, possibly suﬀer from such simple
and direct counterexamples? By reviewing the derivation of the Boltzmann
equation, we realize that equations (1) and (2) hold only for perfectly continuous
distribution functions, while the diverging and converging particles presented
above are related to none of them.

To see the point more vividly, let’s go back to the two-dimensional phase
space, namely the x-vx space, and investigate the evolution of the particles
marked with the dotted curve in Fig. 2. In the schematic sense, we may say
that at t = 0 all these particles are distributed along the diagonal of ∆x∆vx
shown in Fig. 3a, rather than in ∆x∆vx uniformly. After a while, at t = T , this
diagonal is stretched and becomes longer as shown in Fig. 3b. If we set up a
small, but deﬁnite, phase volume element and let it move together with one of
the particles, we will certainly ﬁnd that the particle density within it decreases.
(For discontinuous distributions, if we allow the shape and size of measuring
volume element to vary, we can get any value, drastically from zero to inﬁnity,
for the particle density.)

Now, it is in order to examine how a realistic boundary surface S “reﬂects”
realistic particles that come from all directions and with diﬀerent speeds. Exper-
imental facts inform us that the reﬂection cannot be truly elastic and stochastic
and dissipative eﬀects must play a certain role[14]. To express particles “pro-
duced” by such surface, it is proper (particularly if the gas is a rareﬁed one) to
deﬁne the instant emission rate σ on an inﬁnitesimal surface dS in such a way
that

σdtdSdvdΩ

(7)

represents the number of particles ejected by the surface element in the speed
range dv and in the solid angle range dΩ during the time interval dt. By al-
lowing the emission rate σ to be described in probability and to have certain
dependence on velocities of incident particles, it can be said that the stochastic
and dissipative nature of the reﬂection has been included. Then, divide S into
N surface elements. Referring to Fig. 4, we ﬁnd that for the ith surface element
(∆S)i the reﬂected particles are like ones emitted from a “point particle source”
at r0i, the position vector of (∆S)i, and the relevant distribution function at a
point r in the reﬂection region takes the form

f (r, v, Ω) =

Vi(v)δ(Ω − Ωr−r0i ),

(8)

σ(∆S)i
|r − r0i|2v3

where Vi(v) is a certain function of v and δ(Ω − Ωr−r0i) is the δ-function deﬁned
on the solid angle in the velocity space. It is very obvious that, regardless of
the forms of σ and V (v), this distribution function diverges in the phase space.
Another interesting point about the distribution function is that it is perfectly
continuous in terms of r and v and it is like a function deﬁned on a single point in

4

terms of Ω. Based on this observation, we are tempted to say that the function
is on a variable domain of 4 + ǫ dimensions. The total distribution function at
r associated with all reﬂected particles from S is

f (r, v, Ω) =

Vi(v)δ(Ω − Ωr−r0i).

(9)

N

Xi=1

σ(∆S)i
|r − r0i|2v3

Though the distribution function expressed by (9) can, as N → ∞, be regarded
as a sum of an inﬁnitely large number of (4 + ǫ)−dimensional functions, it is
not a continuous function deﬁned in the phase space. Actually, with help of this
expression, we can analytically or numerically prove that the particle number
within a given moving volume element drdv is capable of decreasing, increasing
or keeping invariant. As a limiting case, we may assume S to be relatively small,
or the distance |r − r0i| to be relatively large, and ﬁnd that expression (9) is
reduced to expression (8) and the particles related to it always diverge in the
phase space.

The above investigation, though formally simple, provides us with a very
new picture on gas dynamics. Rather than as a continuous medium or an in-
compressible ﬂuid in the phase space, a gas should be considered as a special
collection of discrete particles, whose distribution function can change from con-
tinuous one to discontinuous one, as well as from discontinuous one to continu-
ous one. Another notable fact, which may very much interest scientists carrying
out practical studies, is that the changeovers aforementioned occur dramatically
near interfaces between ﬂuids and solid boundaries.

We now turn our attention to the validity of the collisional operator on
the right side of (3). A widely accepted concept is that in order to formulate
collisional eﬀects we are supposed to focus ourselves on a ﬁxed six-dimensional
phase volume element and study how particles leave and enter the element due
to collisions. In what follows, it will be shown that such concept is, much to our
surprise, deceptive.

Firstly, particles leaving a phase volume element drdv during a time interval
dt are of interest. According to the standard theory, if a particle collides with
another within the volume element drdv during dt, it should be considered as
one that leaves the volume element during the time interval because of the ve-
locity change caused by the collision (see Fig. 5). This intuitive, seemingly very
reasonable, picture can be challenged in the following way. In deriving kinetic
equations, a necessary step is to let dt, dr and dv approach zero independently.
If it is assumed, in the limiting processes, that the length scale |dr| is much
smaller than |vdt|, then virtually all the particles, initially within drdv, will
leave drdv at the end of dt, irrespective of suﬀering collisions or not. If we still
want to say that the standard consideration, concerning how many particles
stay inside drdv without involving collisions and how many particles get out of
drdv with collisions involved, holds its signiﬁcance, we have no choice but to
assume that |dr| >> |vdt|. An unfortunate fact is that no sound reason can be

5

found out for that we can prefer this assumption to its converse.

Secondly, particles entering a phase volume element drdv during dt are under
In the standard treatment, two beams with velocities v′ and
examination.
v′
1 are assumed to collide within a volume element dr during dt and to give
contribution to the particles expressed by f (r, v, t)drdv, as shown in Fig. 6.
Ironically enough, this treatment involves not one but many paradoxes. As
one thing, particles produced by collisions in a small spatial region, like ones
emitted from a point particle source, will diverge in the phase space and cannot
be treated as an ordinary contribution to f (t, r, v)drdv. As another thing, we
again need to let dt, dr and dv approach zero. If |dr| << |vdt|, all produced
particles will “instantly” leave drdv and only an insigniﬁcant fraction of them
can be treated as a contribution to f (r, v, t)drdv. See Ref. 16 to get more
paradoxes.

In summary, two paradoxical aspects of the standard kinetic theory have
been presented. The ﬁrst aspect is related to the distribution function. A
tacit assumption of the existing kinetic equations is that distribution functions,
though describing discrete particles, must be mentally and practically contin-
uous. The discussion of this paper, however, shows that distribution functions
of realistic gases have, in general, complex local structures and they cannot be
described by continuous distribution functions. The second aspect is related to
the phase space. A usual concept in the standard theory is that the position
space and the velocity space can be separated mentally and practically. The
discussion of this paper, however, shows that whenever we investigate the time
dynamics of particles in the velocity space we should keep an eye on what takes
place in the position space, and vice versa.

A variety of fundamental questions can be raised, of which many are beyond
the scope of this brief paper. In some of our recent works, we make more analyses
and put forward alternative approaches[15, 16]. With help of a development
in quantum mechanics[17], some of the discussion in this paper can also be
extended to the regime of quantum statistical physics.

In the framework of the variational principle the canonical variables describing magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) ﬂows of general type (i.e., with spatially varying entropy and nonzero values of all
topological invariants) are introduced. It is shown that the velocity representation of the Clebsch
type following from the variational principle with constraints is equivalent to that resulting from
the generalization of the Weber transformation performed in the paper for the case of arbitrary
MHD ﬂows. Using such complete velocity representation enables us not only to describe the gen-
eral type ﬂows in terms of single–valued functions, but also to solve the intriguing problem of the
“missing” MHD integrals of motion. The set of hitherto known MHD local invariants and integrals
of motion appears to be incomplete: for the vanishing magnetic ﬁeld it does not reduce to the set
of the conventional hydrodynamic invariants. And if the analogs of the vorticity and helicity were
discussed earlier for the particular cases, the analog of Ertel invariant has been so far unknown. It
is shown that all “missing” invariants are expressed in terms of the decomposition of the velocity
representation into the “hydrodynamic” and “magnetic” parts. In spite of the nonunique character
of such representation it is shown that there exists a natural restriction of the gauge transformations
set allowing one to make the invariants gauge independent. It is found that on the basis of the new
invariants introduced a wide set of high–order invariants can be constructed. The new invariants
are relevant both for the deeper insight into the problem of the topological structure of the MHD
ﬂows as a whole and for the examination of the stability problems. The additional advantage of
the proposed approach is that it enables one to deal with discontinuous ﬂows, including all types of
possible breaks.

I.

INTRODUCTION.

It is well–known that description of the solid media ﬂows in terms of the canonical (Hamiltonian) variables is
very useful and eﬀective, see for instance [1, 2]. On the basis of the Hamiltonian variables it is possible to deal
with all nonlinear processes in uniﬁed terms which are independent of the speciﬁc problem related to the media
under investigation. For instance, all variants of the perturbation theory are expressed in terms of diﬀerent order
nonlinear vertices, which along with the linear dispersion relation contain the speciﬁc information relating to the
concrete system, cf. Refs. [3, 4]. In studying nonlinear stability problems the conventional Hamiltonian approach
based upon the corresponding variational principle allows one to use the Hamiltonian along with other integrals of
motion (momentum, number of quasi-particles, topological invariants) in order to construct the relevant Lyapunov
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Therefore, it is important to address the problem of introducing the canonical
functional, cf. Refs.
variables and corresponding variational principle for the general type MHD ﬂows (i. e., rotational, non–barotropic
and including all types of breaks that are possible for MHD) and obtaining the complete set of the local invariants,
see deﬁnition and discussions in original papers [10, 11, 12, 13] and in the recent review [1]. As for the ﬁrst item, the
example of the variational principle describing all possible breaks is given in the recent work [14].

Here in the framework of some modiﬁcation of the variational principle of the latter work we examine the problem
of the MHD invariants. Note that the set of invariants for MHD discussed in the literature has been so far incomplete.
The statement becomes apparent when it is considered that for the vanishing magnetic ﬁeld this set has to be reduced
to that of the conventional hydrodynamic invariants. But this limit transition does not reproduce Ertel, vorticity and
helicity invariants existing for the hydrodynamic ﬂows.

Despite the fact that for the dissipation-free MHD ﬂows there exist additional topological invariants, namely,
magnetic helicity and cross–helicity, introduced in the papers, [15, 16, 17], the analogs of the vorticity and helicity
invariants have not been discussed with necessary completeness thus far, cf., for instance, the recent review [1]. The
related quantities were mentioned for the speciﬁc cases of symmetric ﬂows in the works [18, 19, 20], the vorticity and
helicity invariants for the incompressible ﬂows have been obtained recently in Refs. [8, 9]. But analog of the Ertel
invariant have not been presented so far (see the short communication in [21]). The problem of obtaining the analogs
of the hydrodynamic invariants consists in the non-potential character of the Lorentz force. Therefore, the vorticity

and helicity of the total velocity ﬁeld v are not conserved along with the Ertel invariant construction, ρ−1ω · ∇s.
Nevertheless, corresponding generalizations have to exist, which becomes evident from the simple consideration.
Namely, let us consider the well known set of invariants for dissipation–free MHD ﬂows (energy, magnetic and cross
helicity). Setting the magnetic ﬁeld zero we arrive at zero values of the magnetic and cross helicity invariants, but
do not get Ertel invariant (and hydrodynamic vorticity and helicity for the barotropic ﬂows). This fact indicates
incompleteness of the MHD invariants set. Evidently, there have to exist MHD analog of the Ertel invariant passing
on to the hydrodynamic Ertel invariant for the vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. Below we derive the MHD generalization
for the Ertel invariant and show that the generalized vorticity and helicity invariants also exist for the compressible
barotropic MHD ﬂows. The possibility of obtaining these invariants is based upon the velocity decomposition in
the two parts, “hydrodynamic” and “magnetic”. The latter vanishes with the magnetic ﬁeld vanishing and can be
presented in the form of the vector product of the magnetic ﬁeld and the canonically conjugate momentum and was
ﬁrst introduced in the paper [22]. In spite of the artiﬁcial character of the velocity ﬁeld decomposition at ﬁrst sight, we
show that the decomposition naturally follows both from the least action principle in the canonical variables and from
the partial integration of the Euler equations of motion (generalized Weber transformation, cf. Ref. [23, 24]). For the
incompressible ﬂows the latter was presented in the papers [8, 9]. Note that the “hydrodynamic” part of the velocity
is of the Clebsch type but involves vector potentials instead of the scalar ones, see discussion in Refs. [1, 14, 25, 26].
The use of the vector Clebsch potentials allows one to deal with the ﬂows possessing nontrivial topology, contrary to
the restriction to the scalar potentials. If the latter are single-valued then the helicity vanishes identically.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section II we brieﬂy discuss the appropriate variational principle, intro-
ducing the Clebsch type velocity representation by means of constraints and deﬁning the canonical variables. The
velocity representation thus obtained yields the necessary decomposition. In section III we develop generalization of
the Weber transformation and show that it leads to the velocity representation, which is equivalent to that following
from the variational principle under discussion. In section IV we examine the MHD integrals of motion, introducing
“missing” MHD invariants, and discuss their transformation properties relating to the gauge change. We show that
there exist natural gauges under which the additional basic invariants become unambiguous, speciﬁcally that with a
vanishing initial value of the magnetic part of the velocity representation. In section V we make some conclusions
and formulate problems to be solved later.

II. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND CANONICAL VARIABLES.

Let us brieﬂy describe the variational principle and subsidiary variables describing dissipation-free MHD. Starting

with the standard Lagrangian density

L = ρ

− ρε(ρ, s) +

v2
2

H2
8π

,

where ρ, s and ε(ρ, s) are the ﬂuid density, entropy and internal energy, respectively, H denotes the magnetic ﬁeld,
we have to include the constraint terms in the action A. Then the action can be presented as

where Lc is the part of the Lagrangian density respective for the constraints,

A =

Z

dtL′ ,

L′ =

drL′ ,

L′ = L + Lc ,

Lc = ρDϕ + λDµ + σDs − M ·

− v × curlA + ∇Λ

−

H · curlA
4π

.

(cid:19)

Z

∂A
∂t

(cid:18)

Here D = ∂t + v · ∇ is the substantial (material) derivative and A is the vector potential.[32] Including the terms with
Λ and H = curlA into Lc allows us to obtain the dynamic equation for the vector potential in the gauge invariant
form (see Eq. (10) below) and to introduce relation H = curlA strictly into the variational principle.

Supposing ﬁrst that all variables introduced (including velocity) are independent, we obtain the following set of

variational equations

δϕ =⇒ ∂tρ + div(ρv) = 0,

δρ =⇒ Dϕ = w − v2/2 ,

δλ =⇒ Dµ = 0 ,

δµm =⇒ ∂tλm + div(λmv) = 0,

δσ =⇒ Ds = 0,

δs =⇒ ∂tσ + div(σv) = −ρT,

δM =⇒ ∂tA = v × curlA − ∇Λ,

δA =⇒ ∂tM =

+ curl[v × M].

curlH
4π

δH =⇒ H = curlA,

δΛ =⇒ divM = 0,

where w and T are the enthalpy density and temperature.[33]

Note that in this section we assume the velocity ﬁeld to be independent of other variables. Therefore, variation

with respect to v results in the velocity representation

δv =⇒ ρv = −ρ∇ϕ − λm∇µm − σ∇s − H × M.

It is convenient to rewrite it in a shortened form that emphasizes its structure. Bearing in mind that the velocity
potential ϕ, the vector Lagrange markers µ, entropy s and the vector potential A can be treated as generalized
coordinates, one can see that ρ, λ, σ and subsidiary ﬁeld −M are conjugated momenta, respectively. Let[34]

Q = (Q, A), Q = (ϕ, µ, s), P = δA/δ(∂tQ), P = (ρ, λ, σ), P = (P, −M).

Then the velocity representation takes the transparent form

v = v0(P, ∇Q), v0 = vh + vM , vh = −

∇Q, vM = −

P
ρ

H × M
ρ

.

Here subindexes h and M correspond to the “hydrodynamic” and “magnetic” parts of the velocity ﬁeld. The suﬃx
zero on v underlines the fact that v0 is supposed to be the dependent variable, it is expressed in terms of the canonical
variables by means of the representation found. The hydrodynamic part, vh, corresponds to the generalized Clebsch
[14, 25, 26], and the magnetic part, vM , coincides with the traditional term if we replace the
representation, cf.
divergence-free ﬁeld M by curlS. This term was ﬁrst introduced by Zakharov and Kuznetsov, cf. Ref. [22]. But they
used the incomplete form for the hydrodynamic part of the velocity, restricting it to the scalar Clebsch variables. This
reduced form[35] evidently corresponds to the ﬂows with zero–valued generalized helicity (or, for H → 0, it results
in the hydrodynamic helicity vanishing) if the scalar Clebsch variables are single–valued. Besides, the above velocity
representation involves the entropy term, −σ∇S/ρ. The latter is essential for the discontinuous ﬂows with any types
of the dynamically allowable breaks, including shocks, cf. Refs. [14, 21, 25, 26]. Note that Lagrange markers µ are
continuous crossing the break surface, contrary to the entropy. Therefore, the entropy term can be omitted for the
continuous ﬂows when the entropy can be considered as a continuous function depending on the Lagrange markers.
From the velocity representation Eq. (16) and the equations of motion (4) – (11) it strictly follows that the velocity
ﬁeld v = v0 satisﬁes Euler equation with the magnetic force taken into account. Namely, providing diﬀerentiation we
have

where p is the ﬂuid pressure.

A. Canonical variables.

The variational principle can be easily reformulated in the Hamiltonian form. Excluding the magnetic and velocity

ﬁelds by means of Eqs. (12), (16) we arrive at the following Hamiltonian density

Equations of motion (4) – (11) can now be expressed in the canonical form

∂tQ = δH/δP ,

∂tP = −δH/δQ ,

Q = (ϕ, µ, s; A) , P = (ρ, λ, σ; −M) ;

Eq. (12) serves as a deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld, and the divergence–free condition for the subsidiary ﬁeld M,
Eq. (13), follows from the variation of the action

A =

dt

Z

Z

dr (P∂tQ − H)

with respect to Λ. Note that it is possible to put Λ = 0. Under this assumption the divergence–free condition for the
ﬁeld M vanishes. But from Eq. (11) it follows that divM is a conserved quantity, ∂tdivM = 0. Therefore, supposing
that divM = 0 holds for some initial moment we arrive at the conclusion that this is valid for the arbitrary moment.
Nevertheless, it proves convenient to deal with Λ 6= 0 that makes it possible to use diﬀerent gauge conditions for the
vector potential.

The above variational principle results in the set of dynamic equations. From the latter follow the conventional
MHD equations, (4), (9), (17) and the equation for the magnetic ﬁeld, which follows from Eq. (10) after taking curl,

∂tH = curl[v × H].

On the contrary, if at some initial moment, t = ¯t, we have the conventional MHD ﬁelds ¯ρ, ¯s, ¯v and H, then we
can ﬁnd the initial subsidiary ﬁelds ¯ϕ, ¯µ, ¯λ, ¯σ, ¯A, M and ¯Λ, satisfying Eqs. (12) – (14). This can be done to within
the gauge transformations (the latter do not change both the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld) due to the fact that
the subsidiary ﬁelds play a role of generalized potentials. Then, if the uniqueness conditions are satisﬁed both for
the conventional MHD equations and for the set of variational equations, we are led to conclude that corresponding
solutions coincide for all moments. In this sense we can state that these sets of equations are equivalent, cf. Ref. [4].
The complete representation of the velocity ﬁeld in the form of the generalized Clebsch representation (16) allows,
ﬁrst, to deal with the MHD ﬂows of general type, including all types of breaks, cf. Ref. [14]; second, for the zero
magnetic ﬁeld it results in the correct limit transition to the conventional hydrodynamics, cf. Refs. [25, 26]; third, it
allows obtaining the integrals and invariants of motion for the MHD ﬂows additional to the known ones: for instance,
the generalized Ertel invariant, generalized vorticity and generalized helicity, see below. The two last integrals were
deduced for the particular case of incompressible ﬂows in the papers [8, 9], cf. also papers [18, 19, 20] where the
vorticity and helicity analogs were obtained for the MHD ﬂows with the speciﬁc spatial symmetry.

Moreover, it is possible to show that representation (16) is equivalent to that following from the Weber transfor-

mation, cf. Refs. [23, 24] and the recent review [1].

III. GENERALIZED WEBER TRANSFORMATION.

Suppose that the ﬂuid particles are labelled by Lagrange markers a = (a1, a2, a3). The label of the particle passing

through point r = (x1, x2, x3) at time t is then

The particle paths and velocities are given by the inverse function

a = a(r, t), Da =

+ (v · ∇)a = 0.

∂a
∂t

r = r(a, t), v = Dr(a, t) = ∂r/∂t|a=const .

Let the initial position of the particle labelled a is X, i.e.,

r(a, 0) = X(a).

A natural choice of the labels would be X(a) = a; however it is convenient to retain the extra freedom represented
by the “rearrangement function” X(a).

We seek to transform the equation of motion (17) to an integrable form, by generalizing the argument of Weber

[23] (see, for example, Refs. [29], [1], and [8]. It is convenient to represent Eq. (17) as

where h = H/ρ and the vector j is deﬁned according to

Dv = −∇w + T ∇s + j × h,

j =

It is convenient to transform the last term by means of the dynamic equation for the subsidiary ﬁeld m = M/ρ
(compare Eq. (11))

Then we can transform the last term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (29) to the form of the substantial derivative, see Appendix,

Analogously, the ﬁrst two terms in the r.h.s. of Eq. (29) can be presented as substantial derivatives by means of

introducing subsidiary functions ϕ and σ, which satisfy equations (compare Eqs. (9), (5))

This representation obviously coincides with the above discussed Clebsch representation if one identiﬁes b with
−λ/ρ and a with µ. Moreover, this proves equivalence of description of the general–type magnetohydrodynamic
ﬂows in terms of canonical variables introduced and the conventional description in Lagrange or Euler variables.
The equations of motion for the generalized coordinates and momenta follow now from deﬁnitions of the subsidiary
variables a, m = M/ρ, σ, ϕ and b.

Emphasize that the vector ﬁeld M = ρm introduced by Eq. (30) satisﬁes the integral relation

where Σ is some oriented area moving with the ﬂuid. This fact was ﬁrst indicated in Ref. [8] for the incompressible
ﬂows. Now we see that it holds true for the general case. The proof of this statement is given in Appendix. Expressing
M = curlS and making use of the Stokes theorem we conclude that time derivative of the vector S circulation over
the closed frozen–in contour ∂Σ is proportional to the current (recall, j = (4π)−1curlH and diﬀers from the current
density by the constant multiplier) intersecting the surface deﬁned by this contour,

continuous barotropic and isentropic ﬂows.

INTEGRALS OF MOTION.

The conservation laws, as is well-known, follow from the speciﬁc symmetries of the action. Existence of the
[30]) of the Lagrange markers, µ, leads to the
relabelling transformations group (ﬁrst discussed by Salmon in Ref.
integrals of motion that are additional to the energy, the ﬂuid momentum and mass conservation. These additional
integrals are expressed in terms of the Lagrange description of the motion, i.e., in terms of the Lagrange markers, etc.
Therefore, as a rule, they are gauge–dependent. The frozen–in character of the magnetic ﬁeld results in the speciﬁc
topological integrals of motion, namely, magnetic helicity and cross–helicity, ﬁrst discussed in Refs. [15, 16, 17], see
also review [1]. Corresponding densities are respectively

hM = A · H,

hC = v · H.

and

and

To clarify the following discussion relating to the additional local invariants and integrals of motion, let us brieﬂy
recall the known ones. As it strictly follows from the dynamic equations, the local conservation law for the magnetic
helicity holds true for general type MHD ﬂows

On the contrary, in the general case the cross-helicity is governed by equation

∂thM + divqM = 0, qM = vhM − H · (A · v − Λ) .

and is not conserved. But for barotropic and isentropic ﬂows the pressure p = p(ρ) and hC is conserved,

∂thC /∂t = −div

vhC + (w − v2/2)H

(cid:2)

∂thC + divqC = 0, qC = vhC + (χ − v2/2)H,

where χ =

Corresponding density is

For the general case one more conserved quantity ﬁrst discovered by Gordin and Petviashvili, cf. Ref. [31], is known.

The integral conservation laws are related to the local conserved quantities. For instance, integrating hP over

arbitrary substantial volume

V we obtain conserved quantity IP ,

Note that hP /ρ gives us an example of the so–called local Lagrange invariants (in other words, Casimirs), cf.

Refs. [10, 11, 12, 13] and [1, 2]. By deﬁnition they obey the following equations

∂thP + divqP = 0, qP = vhP .

Here α and I denote the scalar and vector Lagrange invariants, J is the frozen–in ﬁeld, and L denotes S-type invariant

Evidently, the quantity hP /ρ is the α-type invariant. The Lagrange markers µ and quantities λ/ρ supply examples
of the vector Lagrange invariants, the magnetic ﬁeld H divided by ρ, h = H/ρ, is invariant of the J- type, gradient
of any scalar Lagrange invariant is the S-type invariant,

There also exist other relations between diﬀerent type invariants, see Refs. [1, 2], allowing one to generate new
invariants. For instance, the scalar product of the J and L invariants results in some scalar Lagrange invariant,
symbolically

The above mentioned invariant hP /ρ can be obtained by means of this relation if we put J = h and L = ∇s. Other
examples are represented by relations generating J- (L)- type invariants by means of two L- (J-) type invariants,

Lagrange invariant, D(hM /ρ) = 0.

As for the local conservation law for the cross-helicity, Eq. (49), it obviously leads to the integral conserved quantity

Existence of the recursive procedure allowing one to construct new invariants on the basis of the starting set of
invariants, see Refs. [1, 2], underlines the role of the local invariants among other conserved quantities. Although
in terms of the Lagrangian variables (such as the markers µ) there exists a wide set of invariants, see, for instance,
Ref. [1], the most interesting invariants are such that can be expressed in Eulerian (physical) variables and thus are
gauge–invariant.

Emphasize that in the conventional hydrodynamics there exists Ertel invariant αE,

where ω = curlv is vorticity,

αE = hE/ρ,

hE = ω · ∇s,

∂thE + divqE = 0, qE = hEv, DαE = 0.

For the MHD case the vector ω/ρ is not the frozen–in ﬁeld due to the fact that magnetic force is non–potential.
It seems evident that for the MHD case there have to exist the integrals of motion generalizing the conventional
helicity and Ertel invariant along with vorticity integral. These invariants are to pass into the conventional ones for
the vanishing magnetic ﬁeld. The generalization for the vorticity and helicity invariants was obtained in the paper
[8] for the particular case of the incompressible ﬂows. In the following section it is shown that there exists MHD
generalization for the Ertel invariant, and results of the paper [8] relating to the vorticity and helicity can be extended
to incompressible barotropic MHD ﬂows.

is the frozen–in ﬁeld (“hydrodynamic” part of the vorticity) for the barotropic MHD ﬂows. It would be a trivial
consequence of the fact that [L × L′]/ρ, where L, L′ are Lamb type invariants, is the local invariant of the frozen–in
type if all quantities Q and P/ρ satisfy homogeneous transport equations being α- or I- type invariants (remember
that ∇α and ∇Im are L–type invariants). But ϕ and σ/ρ satisfy the inhomogeneous equations of motion. Therefore,
let us start with equation of motion for the “hydrodynamic” part of the velocity. Diﬀerentiating (16) and making use
of relations

we have

D(∇X) = ∇(DX) − (∇vm) · ∂mX

The term in the square brackets is equal to vm∇vhm − vhm∇vm = v × ωh and we obtain

∂tωh = [∇ρ × ∇p]/ρ2 + curl[v × ωh] .

For the barotropic ﬂows, p = p(ρ), the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. becomes zero and we can see that ωh/ρ is the frozen–in
ﬁeld,

At H = 0, ωh corresponds to the conventional hydrodynamic vorticity.

B. Generalized Kelvin’s theorem.

The frozen–in character of the generalized vorticity allows obtaining the strict generalization of the Kelvin’s theorem
for the barotropic ﬂows. But with some restrictions it is valid also for the non barotropic ﬂows. Namely, circulation
Γ of the hydrodynamic part of the velocity over the closed material contour C is a constant of motion if the entropy
s is constant on this contour,

DΓ = 0, Γ ≡

for

s|C = const.

Note that for barotropic ﬂows this result strictly follows from the fact that ωh/ρ is the frozen–in ﬁeld. Namely, for

C. Generalized helicity.

hH = ωh · vh,

Now it can be proved that generalized helicity, hH , deﬁned in terms of the “hydrodynamic” part of the velocity,

is the integral of motion for barotropic ﬂows. Diﬀerentiating Eq. (75) and taking into account Eqs. (69), (70) for
barotropic ﬂows we arrive at the local conservation law of the form (rather cumbersome calculations are given in
Appendix):

∂thH + divqH = 0, qH = hH v + (χ − v2/2)ωh .

In analogy with the hydrodynamic case we can conclude that the integral helicity IH (deﬁned by means of Eq. (67)) is
the integral invariant, moving together with the ﬂuid if the normal component of the vorticity tends to zero, ωhn = 0,
on the surface of the corresponding substantial volume
V . Note that the condition ωhn = 0 is invariant of the motion
(due to the frozen–in character of ωh/ρ) and therefore it can be related to the initial surface only.

Let us show that there exists strict generalization of the Ertel invariant for the MHD case. For this purpose let us

prove that without any restrictions related to the character of the ﬂow the quantity

being α- type invariant. For the barotropic ﬂows it immediately follows from the fact that ωh/ρ is the frozen–in ﬁeld
if the composition rules given by Eqs. (57) and (56) are taken into account. In order to make the proof for the non

barotropic ﬂows more transparent let us consider a more general situation. Let

e

For Z = 0 these relations prove the generating rule of Eq. (57). But we can see that
J · ∇α becomes the local Lagrange
invariant under less restrictive condition Z · ∇α = 0. That is the case for the Ertel invariant: Z = [∇ρ × ∇p]/ρ3
is orthogonal to ∇s due to the fact that the scalar product of any three thermodynamic quantities is equal to zero
(because any thermodynamic variable in the equilibrium state is a function of two basic variables). This concludes
the proof.

e

The conserved integral quantity associated with αE is

IE =

drhE ,

∂tIE = 0.

(82)

Note that by the structure IE is not gauge–invariant in contrast to the hydrodynamic case. Let us examine its change
h, vM ⇒ v′
under gauge transformation that results in vh ⇒ v′

M with

h + v′

M = vh + vM .

∂tM = curl[v × M],

i.e. m = M/ρ is frozen–in ﬁeld. Then we can conclude that the vector ∇s × [h × m] entering the integrand is the
frozen–in ﬁeld, as it follows from recursion relations (56) – (58). Therefore, if we adopt relation n·[∇s×[h×m]]|∂
V = 0
as the initial condition, then it holds true for all moments. For instance, this relation is fulﬁlled if Hn = 0 and mn = 0
at the initial moment. Evidently, these two conditions cannot be fulﬁlled for an arbitrary gauge. But we can restrict
ourselves to a such subset of the initial conditions for the subsidiary ﬁeld M that M|t=t0 = f H|t=t0, where f is an
arbitrary function. (Then divM = divM|t=t0 = ∇f · H|t=t0 is time–independent in accordance with equation (11),
and for the particular choice of f such that H|t=t0 · ∇f = 0 we have divM = 0.) For these initial conditions M along
with M′ are collinear to H at the initial moment and therefore the initial value of the scalar product n · [∇s × [h m]]
is zero. Due to the frozen–in character of the quantity ∇s × [h × m] equation n · [∇s × [h × m]] = 0 holds true for
the arbitrary moment. Thus we can make the conclusion that gauge dependence of the Ertel’s invariant can be partly
eliminated by appropriate choice of the initial conditions or substantial volumes.

e

E. Speciﬁc gauge.

Examination of the integrals of motion shows that they are gauge–dependent. This dependence is attributed to
diﬀerent decompositions of the velocity ﬁeld into the “hydrodynamic” and “magnetic” parts, v = vh + vM . Underline
that there exists a wide subgroup of the gauge transformations that include transformations that change the generalized
potentials ϕ, µ, λ and σ with no change in M. The “hydrodynamic” part of the velocity representation, vh, does
not evidently vary under the action of transformations of this, say, “hydrodynamic” subgroup. Then the generalized
circulation, integral helicity and Ertel integral are likewise invariant under these gauge transformations. The simplest
way to restrict the gauge transformations by this subgroup consists in adopting zero initial conditions for the subsidiary
ﬁeld M. This choice does not restrict in any way the character of a ﬂow, in particular, all integrals of motion can
possess nonzero values. The more detailed discussion of the gauge dependence of the additional integrals considered
will be presented elsewhere.

V. CONCLUSIONS.

The results obtained can be summarized as follows. First, the variant of introducing the canonical description of the
MHD ﬂows by means of the variational principle with constraints is presented. It is shown that in order to describe
general–type MHD ﬂows it is necessary to use in the generalized Clebsch–type representation for the ﬂuid velocity
ﬁeld the vector Clebsch variables (the Lagrange markers and conjugate momenta) along with the entropy term (cf.
papers [25, 26] describing the hydrodynamic case) and the conventional magnetic term introduced ﬁrst in Ref. [22].
Such a complete representation allows one to deal with general–type MHD ﬂows, including all type of breaks, see Ref.
[14]. Second, it is proved that the generalized Weber transformation introduced leads to the velocity representation,
which is equivalent to that introduced by means of the variational principle. Third, the existence of the generalized
Ertel invariant for MHD ﬂows is proven. Forth, there are generalized the vorticity and helicity invariants for the
compressible barotropic MHD ﬂows (ﬁrst discussed for the incompressible case in cf. [8]). Fifth, the relations between
the local and integral invariants are discussed along with the gauge dependence of the latter.

As a consequence of the completeness of the proposed velocity representation we get the correct limit transition
from the MHD to the conventional hydrodynamic ﬂows. The results obtained allow one to consider the complicated

MHD problems in terms of the Hamiltonian variables. The use of this approach was demonstrated for the speciﬁc
case of incompressible ﬂows in the series of papers [8, 9] devoted to the nonlinear stability criteria. Emphasize that
existence of the additional invariants proved in our paper is of high importance for the stability problems.

Note that existence of the additional basic invariants of the motion makes it actual to examine the problem of the
complete set of independent invariants, and, respectively, the complete set of the corresponding Casimirs, cf. Ref. [1].
For instance, existence of the three independent basic local invariants for the non barotropic ﬂows (s, αE and h)
immediately leads to the two denumerable sets of the monomial scalar invariants

P = (h · ∇)ms, α(m)
α(m)

E = (h · ∇)mαE , α(1)

P = αP , α(0)

E = αE , m = 0, 1, 2, . . .

The ﬁrst set was discussed in the paper [1], and the second subset is a new one along with the “parent” Ertel invariant
αE. Evidently,

e
where f is an arbitrary function, is also the scalar Lagrange invariant. Therefore, we immediately arrive at the
following set of integrals of motion (Casimirs)

which is much wider than that discussed in the literature, cf. Eq. (10.23) in Ref. [1]. The additional set of the scalar
monomial Lagrange invariants can be generated by the magnetic helicity under the speciﬁc gauge condition, Λ = A·v,
α(n)
M = (h · ∇)nαM . This enables evident generalization of the integrals of motion (85).
One example of the additional J– invariants reads

In turn, one can get new sets of the scalar invariants by applying operation (J′ · ∇) to the previous scalar invariants
and so on. Obviously, this also leads to additional Casimirs to that indicated in (85).

For the barotropic ﬂows the picture is analogous: the basic set of the scalar Lagrange invariants involves the
generalized helicity, αH = hH /ρ, and αM (under the gauge condition speciﬁed above), and with J-invariants h and
ωh. Therefore, we obtain additional scalar invariants α(n)
α(n)
M =
(ρ−1ωh · ∇)nαM and the conserved integrals of the form

H = (ρ−1ωh · ∇)nαH ,

This set of the Casimirs generalizes that presented in cf. Ref. [1], the latter follows from (86) if we replace the function
f depending on the four sets of the monomial invariants by a function depending only on the invariants α(n)
M .

Note that we can construct the following generations of the local invariants by means of the recursion relations and
obtain Casimirs of a more sophisticated structure than that presented in (85), (86). The problem of obtaining the
complete set of the local invariants and gauge invariance of the corresponding integral invariants is rather complicated
and is still under examination. This questions will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming paper.

This proves Eq. (31).

Let us check up the integral relation (38). It is suﬃcient to prove the diﬀerential form, namely

where dΣ is some inﬁnitesimal oriented area moving with the ﬂuid. It can be presented as

D(M · dΣ) = j · dΣ,

dΣ = dl1 × dl2,

D(dla) = (dla · ∇)v.

where dl1, dl2 are frozen–in linear elements. Thus, dla, a = 1, 2, are invariants of the J- type and satisfy equations

Consequently, from the recursion relation Eq. (59) it follows that ρdΣ is L- type invariant and hence it is governed
by the dynamic equation

or in the coordinates,

D(ρdΣ) = −∇(ρv · dΣ) + v × curl(ρdΣ),

D(ρdΣi) = −(ρdΣk)∂ivk .

Now it is easy to prove relation (89) without any restrictions for the type of ﬂow. Namely,

D(M · dΣ) = D(m · ρdΣ) = Dm · ρdΣ + miD(ρdΣi) =
= ρdΣ · (m · ∇)v + j · dΣ − miρdΣk∂ivk = j · dΣ .

In order to prove the helicity conservation, Eq. (76), let us consider some scalar quantity of the form

Y = vh · J,

where J is some frozen–in ﬁeld. Then, taking into account that Eq. (69) for the barotropic ﬂows can be rewritten as

we obtain

For J = ωh/ρ we proceed

Dvh = −∇(χ − v2/2) − vhm · ∇vm , χ ≡

dp/ρ,

DY = Dvh · J + vh · DJ = −∇(χ − v2/2) · J.

It is noteworthy that the proof is valid for arbitrary J– type invariant if the ﬁeld ρJ is divergence–free and the ﬂow

∂t(ρJ · vh) = −divq , q = (χ − v2/2)ρJ + v (ρJ · vh)

for div(ρJ) = 0.

For instance, choosing J = h immediately leads to the cross–helicity invariant if one takes into account that H · vh =
H · v.

vector potential for the magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore, here the canonical pair is A, −M instead of H, S, where S = curlM. We
do not consider the discontinuous ﬂows and thus we omit the surface term in the action. But adding corresponding surface
term we can easily take the breaks into account.

[33] Note that substituting M = curlS into Eq. (11) one can integrate it and arrive at the dynamic equation for S, ∂tS =
−1H + v × curlS + ∇Ψ, where Ψ represents a scalar ﬁeld respectful for the S gauge. This relation only by the S sign

(4π)
diﬀers from equation (10.9) of the reference [1] (or Eq. (7) in the original paper [22]).

[34] We do not include Λ into the set of canonical variables dealing with the extended Hamiltonian description, cf. Refs. [27, 28].
Otherwise, we can include Λ into the set of generalized coordinates. Denoting corresponding conjugate momentum πΛ and
adding to the Hamiltonian density, Eq. (18), the term πΛν results in

∂tπΛ = −δH/δΛ = −divM,

∂tΛ = δH/δπΛ = ν.

Variation of the action with respect to the additional variable ν results now in the restriction πΛ = 0. This restriction is
consistent with the set of canonical equations. Namely, Eq. (11) (or, equivalently, the canonical equation ∂tM = δH/δA)
leads to ∂tdivM = 0. The momentum πΛ is the linear function of t, πΛ = πΛ(t0) − (t − t0)divM. The condition πΛ = 0
follows for the speciﬁc choice πΛ(t0) = 0 and divM(t0) = 0. Moreover, as it becomes clear below, the initial condition
M(t0) = 0 (resulting in divM(t0) = divM(t) = 0) leads to essential simpliﬁcations. On the other hand, conditions πΛ = 0,
M(t0) = 0 do not lead to any restrictions on the physical variables and the MHD ﬂow as well. The subsidiary functions Λ
and ν can be expressed in terms of other variables as Λ = ∆
, ν = ∂tΛ, where ∆ denotes the
′
Laplace operator and Λ

is arbitrary solution of the Laplace equation.

[35] Note that the considerations based upon the Pfaﬀ’s theorem also result in the reduced velocity representation. But this
theorem in our case claims only the local equivalence between the three-dimensional vector ﬁeld and the standard form
φ + λ∇µ with the appropriate scalars φ, λ, µ. This point is often ignored.

[36] In terms of the diﬀerential forms α and I are scalar and vector 0–forms; L, J and ρ are 1–, 2– and 3–forms, respectively.

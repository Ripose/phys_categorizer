Abstract

The general hydro-thermodynamic system of equations in 2+1 dimen-
sions with arbitrary equations of state (Taylor series approximation) is
split to eigen modes: Tollmienn-Schlichting (TS) wave and two acoustic
ones. A mode deﬁnition is realized via local relation equations, extracted
from the linearization of the general system over boundary layer ﬂow.
Each such connection deﬁnes the subspace and the corresponding pro-
jector. So the division is performed locally and could help in initial (or
boundary) problems formulation. The general nonlinearity account de-
termines the speciﬁc form of interaction between acoustic and vortical
boundary layer perturbation ﬁelds. After the next projecting to a sub-
space of Orr-Sommerfeld equation solution for the TS wave and the cor-
responding procedure for acoustics, the equations go to one-dimensional
system that describes evolution along the basic stream. A new mechanism
of nonlinear resonance excitation of the TS wave by sound is proposed
and modelled via four-wave interaction. Subjectclass: Primary 35Q30 ;

1 Introduction

It is well-established fact now that a free-stream and a surface disturbances
strongly aﬀect the processes in boundary layer which compose a transition to a
turbulent state. This transition in turn determine such important parameters
of a rigid body in ﬂuid mechanics as skin friction and heat transfer. The clas-
siﬁcation of the free stream was done ﬁrst by Kovasznay et al [1]. It is shown,
that within linear approximation a general small-amplitude unsteady distur-
bance in the free stream can be decomposed into three independent diﬀerent
types: acoustic (A), vortical and entropy modes. Only the ﬁrst one relates to
pressure ﬂuctuations propagating with the sound speed, the last two don’t case
any pressure perturbation. The common idea of many investigations is to pick
out length and time scales of each of these disturbances that would make the
possibility of the Tollmienn-Schlichting (T-S) waves nonlinear generation [2].
This way the mechanism of T-S wave generation by convecting gusts interact-
ing with sound was justiﬁed and numerically investigated [3]. Appropriate scales
of boundary roughness are proved to generate T-S waves both theoretically and
experimentally [4].

In spite of abundant eﬀorts ( see the big introduction and the citations in
[3]), devoted to the problem of a search of an eﬀective control mechanism that
support a cumulative direct energy exchange between T-S an acoustic modes.
Let us mention three important papers about the general, local and distributed
acoustic receptivity [5], [6], [7]. The results however do not look complete:
we revisit the problem in the all-perturbations approach [8, 9] starting from
boundary layer (BL) as a background. The perturbations are considered only
over the stationary boundary layer, we do not account here (but plan to do
it) the layer ﬁeld as a dynamic variable. This scheme gives a possibility to
study mutual interactions on the base of model integrable nonlinear evolution
equation. In our approach the description is local by the construction and do
not need averaging procedure [10]. It covers the known results and give new
hopes for understanding related phenomena appeared in papers from [11] to

2

[12]. We would note that the initial stage of the process of its structure changes
manifests. This eﬀect is similar to heating or streaming generation by acoustic
waves [13], it is a development of the stationary mode and corresponds to an
initial stage of the BL reconstruction.

In this paper we concentrate our eﬀorts on the mathematical formalism: in-
troducing the complete set of basic modes we transform the fundamental system
of standard conservation laws of ﬂuid mechanics to a set of equivalent equations.
In linear approximation the speciﬁc choice of new dependent variables split the
system to the set of independent equations for the given modes, the account of
nonlinearity naturally introduce the interaction by projecting the fundamental
equations set in a vector form. Going to the nonlinear description, we use iter-
ations inside the operator by the small parameter related to amplitude (Mach
number for acoustics) and viscosity (Reynolds number). We also analyze the
possibilities of resonant interaction of quasi-plane waves on the level of so-called
N-wave systems [8]. Being integrable such systems admit explicit solutions and
plenty of conservation laws. Hence the detailed investigation of situation is
possible in this approximation.

The mentioned types of waves (T-S and A) are deﬁned by eigenvectors of
the linearized system of dynamic conservation equations for the free ﬂow. Once
deﬁned, eigenvectors (or modes) are ﬁxed and independent on time. The process
by which the free stream disturbances are internalized to generate boundary-
layer instability waves is referred to as receptivity. The basic idea of this paper
is to deﬁne the T-S and acoustics modes as eigenvectors of the same system
for a viscous ﬂow over a rigid boundary. The eigenvectors of the viscous ﬂow
go to the known limit in the free stream over a boundary. Our idea is to ﬁx
relations between speciﬁc perturbations (velocity components, density and pres-
sure) for every mode followed from the linear equations, to construct projectors
and applied them for the nonlinear dynamics investigation. Thus, in the linear
dynamics the overall ﬁeld may be separated by projectors to the independent
modes at any moment. Fixing the relations when going to the nonlinear ﬂow,
one goes to a system of coupled evolution equations for the modes. These ideas
have applied to nonlinear dynamics of exponentially stratiﬁed gas and bubbly
liquid [9] and other problems [8].

The principal diﬀerence between this consideration and previous ones is the
necessity of variable coeﬃcients incorporation that arise from a boundary layer
structure.
It means that such coordinate dependence impact the projectors
structure: the projector operator should be constructed by nonabelian entries.
By other words the matrix elements of the projector matrix will be operator-
valued ones. In fact we revisit and develop the ﬁrst attempt in this direction
that had been made recently [14], [15].

The T-S wave takes the place of a vortical mode in unbounded space, the
diﬀerence is due to the linearization on the diﬀerent background. When a sta-
tionary boundary-layer ﬂow like Blausius one appears, a linearization should be
correctly proceeded with account of the boundary-layer ﬂow as a background,
that would lead obviously to the other features of the vortical mode then that
in unbounded space. An important feature of T-S mode is non-zero disturbance

3

of pressure already in the linear theory. In the three-dimensional ﬂow, there
exist two T-S modes, two acoustic ones (corrected by background ﬂow), and
one entropy mode as well.

The equations of interaction are derived in Sec. 3 by means of the division
of the perturbation ﬁeld on these subspaces and projecting the system of the
basic equations on the same subspaces. This transformation that in fact is
nothing but a change of variables allows to proceed in a choice of adequate
approximation. Moreover we could analyze possibilities of a direct nonlinear
resonance interaction account. The results are the following: two-wave and
three-wave interaction does not contribute due to the structure of the interaction
terms in its minimal possible order. Hence (in this order) only the four-wave
interaction display a resonance structure. We derive the correspondent four-
wave equations and analyze it in Sec.4.

quadratic nonlinear and viscous terms as well as linear ones related to ther-
mal conductivity, no cross viscous-nonlinear terms accounted. In fact, the third
equation follows from the energy balance and continuity equation. No assump-
tions on ﬂow compressibility was not done yet.

3 Modes in the linear approximation.

The basic system (1-3) contains four dynamic equations and therefore, there
are four independent modes of the linear ﬂow: two acoustic ones, vorticity and
heat modes. This is a classiﬁcation by Kovasznay who deﬁned the acoustic
modes as isentropic and irrotational ﬂow, and refers to the two last ones as to
frozen motions, the vorticity one relating to the absence of pressure and density
perturbations and the heat one relating to the very density perturbation. The
system (1-3) involves three equations indeed, therefore only the three modes
may be extracted - two acoustic and vorticity ones. That is due to the structure

5

of the heat mode where the only density perturbation occurs. Strictly speaking,
the term treating a thermal conductivity in the third of equations (3) includes
the density perturbations and the linearized system (7) (that deﬁnes the modes
as possible types of ﬂow) is not closed. If there was no this term at all there is a
simple linear relation between density and pressure perturbations for the both
acoustic modes. The presence of thermal conductivity corrects this relation as
it was shown in [18]. When the eﬀects of thermal conductivity are small, the
corresponding terms may be placed to the right-hand side of equation together
with nonlinear ones and be accounted further. So the excluding of the dynamic
equation for density serve just a simpliﬁcation of a problem suitable in the view
of its extraordinary complexity when the heat mode is out of the area of interest.
The main idea is to deﬁne modes accordingly to the speciﬁc relations of the
basic perturbation variables following from the linearized system of dynamic
equations (1-3). In general, the procedure is algorithmic and may be expressed
as consequent steps : to ﬁnd the dispersion relation and its roots that determine
all possible modes, and to deﬁne relations between speciﬁc variables for every
mode. Later, projectors follow immediately from these relations , they separate
every mode from the overall ﬁeld of the linear ﬂow exactly and serve as a tool
for the nonlinear dynamics investigation.

Using the left-hand part of the system (7) as a basis of modes deﬁnition
and introducing the two non-dimensional functions V0(z) = U0(z)/U∞ , φ(z) =
V0z(z)l0 , we rewrite it in the non-dimensional variables

x∗ = x/l0, w∗ = w/U∞, u∗ = u/U∞, t∗ = tU∞/l0, p∗ = p/ρ0U 2
∞.

(9)

The value U∞ marks velocity of a ﬂow far from the boundary, and l0 - boundary
layer width. In the new variables (asterisks will be later omitted) (7) with zero

3.1 The Tollmienn-Schlichting mode.

Formally, the limit of incompressible ﬂuid ( ǫ = 0 ) corresponds to the vorticity
mode. The ﬁrst relation for velocity components is well-known [3]:

∂u/∂x + ∂w/∂z = 0.

(13)

From the equations(11,12) an expression for the pressure perturbation fol-

lows:

2φ∂w/∂x + ∆p = 0

(14)

where ∆ = ∂2/∂z2 − k2 stands for the Laplacian so far the ∂/∂x equivalent
operator (multiplier) −ik is used. Both (13) and (14) deﬁne the TS mode due
to relations of the speciﬁc perturbations of pressure and velocity components.
Since the geometry of the viscous ﬂow over boundary supposes strong non-
uniformity in the vertical direction, all disturbances may be thought in the
basis of not plane waves but in the functions like Ψ(x, z) = ψ(z) exp(iωt − ikx)
. So, one has to leave vertical derivatives that usually are large in comparison
with the horizontal ones. The result is rather obvious hence we do not introduce
a special small parameter. The vector of the T-S mode may be chosen as:

Note also, that the equations (10-12) yield the well-known equation for the
TS mode [17], when rewritten for the new variable such the stream function
( u = ∂Ψ/∂z , w = −∂Ψ/∂x, with the obvious restriction to the solenoidal
velocity ﬁeld (13):

That equation is an initial point of the laminar ﬂow stability theory and for
every pair (k,Re) determines an eigenfunction ψ(z) and complex phase velocity
c = ω/k = cr + ici . The sign of ci is namely a criterion of ﬂow stability: a
negative value corresponds to the growth of perturbation and therefore to the
non-stability of the ﬂow.

We would not consider here the perturbation velocity ﬁeld changes, forced by the
ambient movement of the ﬂuid. It could be account by the perturbation theory
to be developed here. Then, two acoustic modes are deﬁned with relations
between speciﬁc perturbations:

4 Projectors in the linear problem.

The TS and two acoustic modes are determined by relations of speciﬁc perturba-
tions or, in the vector form (15), (19). The superposition of such disturbances
appear as all possible types of ﬂow except of the heat mode. Every mode is
completely deﬁned by one of speciﬁc perturbations - pressure or velocity com-
ponents since there are strict and local relations between them. Practically, in
a linear ﬂow, the overall perturbation may be de-coupled into modes by the
corresponding orthogonal projectors. The arbitrary perturbation then is a sum
of modes which, taking into account (15), (19) looks:

The projectors possess all properties of orthogonal projectors and their sum

is unit matrix since all eigenvectors of linear system are accounted.

T S = PT S, ..., PT S + PA1 + PA2 = I, PT S · PA1 = PT S · PA2 = ... = 0,
P 2

where I and 0 are unit and zero matrices correspondingly. We would stress
that the operators deﬁned by the (22, 23, 24) contain operator-valued matrix
elements. Hence the derivation of their explicit form as well as the properties
mentioned above could be checked taking the nonabelian nature of the operators
into account. In the linear ﬂow, the projectors separate every mode from the
overall perturbation, for example:

p
u
w

PT S 









pT S
uT S
wT S



(25)

and so on. Moreover, acting by a projector on the basic system of dynamic
equations (10-12), yields a linear evolution equation for the mode assigned to this
projector. One produces three equations indeed for every speciﬁc perturbations
which are essentially the same with account of relations (14), (19). For the ﬁrst
rightwards progressive acoustic mode the evolution equation reads:

∂pA1/∂t + V0∂pA1/∂x + ǫ

−1∆1/2pA1 = 0

(26)

The equation for the second (opposite directed) acoustic mode is produced by
acting the projector pA2 on the basic system and diﬀer from 26 only by the sign
before the last term. Combining equations for these directed acoustic modes
one arrives at the wave equation of second order

(∂/∂t + V0∂/∂x)2 p − ǫ

−2∆p = 0.

This equation appears as a limit of more general one: that relates to both
acoustic modes and can be found in [16].

All the projectors do commute with operators ∂/∂t · I and L, so one can act
by projectors on the system of equations (30), (31) directly thus obtaining the
evolution equation for the correspondent mode. There are three such equations
for the speciﬁc perturbations p, u, w for every mode (that are equivalent) ac-
counting the relations between these speciﬁc perturbations. So, as independent
variable for every mode a single speciﬁc perturbation, such as pressure or one
velocity component, may be chosen.

Due to the existing tradition it is convenient to use the stream function as

a basic for the TS mode and pressure perturbations for the acoustic modes.

Acting by the PT S on the both sides of (30), one gets an evolution equation:

∆∂Ψ/∂t + V0∆∂Ψ/∂x − ∂Ψ/∂x · ∂φ/∂z − Re

−1∆2Ψ = ∂

∂z [−u∂u/∂x

−w∂u/∂z + ρ∂p/∂x] − ∂

∂x [−u∂w/∂x − w∂w/∂z + ρ∂p/∂z] .

(32)

Next it should be noted that in the right-hand nonlinear side p, u, w are
overall perturbations to be presented as a sum of speciﬁc perturbations of all
modes:

u = ∂Ψ/∂z + ǫ∆−1/2∂pA1/∂x − ǫ∆−1/2∂pA2/∂x
w = −∂Ψ/∂x + ǫ∆−1/2∂pA1/∂z − ǫ∆−1/2∂pA2/∂z
p = 2∂2/∂x2∆−1(φΨ) + pA1 + pA2

(33)

Indeed, there is also a density perturbation in the right-hand nonlinear side
that was not involved in the left-hand linear one at all. The continuity equation
reads

∂ρ/∂t + V0∂ρ/∂x + (∂u/∂x + ∂w/∂z) = −∂(ρu)/∂x − ∂(ρw)/∂z

(34)

Comparing linear left-hand side of equation (34) with that of the ﬁrst equa-

tion from (26), the obvious relations for the both acoustic modes follow:

ρA1 = ǫ2pA1 , ρA2 = ǫ2pA2 .
A limit ǫ = 0 yields in the TS mode for incompressible ﬂow: ρT S = 0 .

Therefore, the last relation for the overall density perturbation looks

ρ = ǫ2pA1 + ǫ2pA2

Finally, (32) goes to

∆Ψt + V0∆Ψx − Ψxφz − Re

−1∆2Ψ = −Ψz∆Ψx + Ψx∆Ψz−

ǫ(∆Ψ∆1/2(pA1 − pA2) + ∆Ψx∆−1/2(pA1 − pA2)x+
∆Ψz∆−1/2(pA1 − pA2)z) + O(ǫ2).

(35)

(36)

Derivatives are marked with lower indices. The ﬁrst two nonlinear terms in the
right-hand side of (36) expresses the TS mode self-action, and the last ones -
cross acoustic-vorticity terms responsible for the acoustic mode inﬂuence on the
TS mode propagation. The structure of the quadratic nonlinear column (30)
yields in the absence of quadratic acoustic terms in (36).

In the limit of V0 = 0 , φ = 0 the only self-action give the well-known

evolution equation for vorticites transition [17] follows from (36):

∆Ψt − Re

−1∆2Ψ + Ψz∆Ψx − Ψx∆Ψz = 0.

Let an acoustic ﬁeld consists of only the ﬁrst mode. Acting by projector PA1

on the system (28), we get an evolution equation for this mode:

Here constants Z and S are deﬁned earlier by (8). The variables p, u, w, are

Between the nonlinear terms one can recognize interaction (A1 − T S )and gen-
eration ones (T S −T S). The equation for pA2 is obtained by projecting PA2 and
looks very similar. The complete system includes this equation and (38),(32).
The system covers all possible processes description up to quadratic terms ap-
proximation. Here a multimode TS waves in the (OS) equation solutions basis
could be incorporated . The long-wave limit of such disturbance leads to coupled
KdV system [14].

6 Resonance interaction of acoustic and TS modes.

Equations (36), (38) form a coupled system of evolution equations for interacting
acoustic and TS modes. In the case of the TS mode generation by an incoming
ﬁrst acoustic mode, the early stage of evolution (for small amplitudes of TS
mode) is deﬁned by a system:

∆Ψt + V0∆Ψx − Ψx · φz − Re

2Ψzz∆−1/2pA1xz + 2Ψxx∆−1/2pA1xz + 2Ψxz∆−1/2pA1zz].]

All quadratic terms relating to T S − T S interaction, are left out of account .
For simplicity, we consider only the ﬁrst incoming acoustic mode.

As it follows from the discussion in the introduction, let us ﬁnd a solution

in the form:

pA1(x, z, t) = A1(µx, µt)π1 exp(i(ω1t − k1x)) + A2(µx, µt)π2 exp(i(ω2t − k2x)) + c.c.

Ψ(x, z, t) = B3(µx, µt)ψ3(z) exp(i(ω3t − k3x)) + B4(µx, µt)ψ4(z) exp(i(ω4t − k4x)) + c.c.

12

where Π1 = π1(k1, ω1, z) exp(i(ω1t − k1x)) , Π2 = π2(k2, ω2, z) exp(i(ω2t − k2x))
are planar waves. Π1 satisﬁes the linear evolution equation (26)

∂Π1/∂t + V0∂Π1/∂x + ǫ

−1∆1/2Π1 = 0.

that leads to the equivalent equation for Π1

iω1Π1 − ik1V0Π1 + ǫ

−1∆1/2Π1 = 0.

Suppose the vertical gradients of all wave functions inside the viscous layer are
much bigger then horizontal ones. From experiments (e.g.
[11]), it is known,
that wavelength of TS mode is much greater than a thickness of the boundary
viscous layer for common values of Reynolds number. So, the operator ∆1/2
may be evaluated as the generalized operator (Taylor) series with respect to
∂z/k1. Hence the operator radical in the ﬁrst approximation is evaluated via
Gataux derivative as

The same equation obviously deﬁne π2, it is enough to change indices 1 → 2 in
the operator. The functions ψ3(z) , ψ4(z) are solutions of the OS equation (17)
suitable for a concrete problem. A1 ,.., B4 are slowly varying functions of x, t,
that’s why an additional small parameter µ is introduced , generally, they are
complex functions. Calculating the right-hand nonlinear expressions, we take
only ﬁrst term in series to avoid small terms of the higher order.

Let us discuss a possibility of four-waves resonance. Examining the algebraic

relations between parameters yields the appropriate conditions:

ω1 = ω2 − ω3, ω2 = ω1 + ω3, ω3 = ω1 + ω4, ω4 = ω3 − ω1

(46)

Substituting the formulas (41, 42) to (43,39), and picking up the resonant
terms only, one goes to the further system of equations (complex conjugate

This resulting equation may be considered as 4-wave resonance equation but
without synchronism condition [23]. The coeﬃcients of the equation depend on
z, it is due to our choice of the only one transverse mode for each ”horizontal”
one. Following the lines of [8], that have a connection of Galerkin numerical
method,

We continue the projecting procedure considering the transverse modes as
a basis. In such problems we naturally arrive at two bases. One arises from
TSW theory and its origin is from OS equation (denoted by ). Other is from
sound problem. Of course, such bases are not orthogonal. Hence we could
only multiply each equation by the its own basic vector and integrate across
the boundary layer. The result is written in ”back”-re-scaled variables: we put
µ = 1.

A structure of the obtained equations is the particular case of general N-wave
system , that may be solved by special technics valid for integrable equations
[23]. The 4-wave approximation may give rise to such solutions that exhibit
eﬀective energy exchange between modes. The form of the nonlinearity is typical
for a 3-wave systems and even small ﬂuctuations of a TS ﬁeld could initiate a
rapid growth of both components if the acoustic ﬁeld is big enough. It is pure
nonlinear instability that may be supported by linear stability curve shift [15].
The numerical evaluation of the integrals in constants 48 need rather compulsory
calculations. The solution of the system (47) pose also the separate problem.
We plan to present the results in a next paper.

7 Conclusion

The resulting system (32),(38) and the equation of the opposite directed A-mode
could be considered as a basic one for all-perturbations over a BL description.
We also would note that the boundary layer width may depend on x. A slow
dependence is usually accepted and do not change the general structure of the
expressions. As the resonant as a non-resonant processes may be studied with
the acoustic waves separated. The modes have the diﬀerent scales, hence a
numerical modelling of the mutual generation and control also could be more
eﬀective.

Quasi-planar steep water waves

V. P. Ruban∗

(Dated: January 14, 2014)

A new description for highly nonlinear potential water waves is suggested, where weak 3D eﬀects
are included as small corrections to exact 2D equations written in conformal variables. Contrary to
the traditional approach, a small parameter in this theory is not the surface slope, but it is the ratio
of a typical wave length to a large transversal scale along the second horizontal coordinate. A ﬁrst-
order correction for the Hamiltonian functional is calculated, and the corresponding equations of
motion are derived for steep water waves over an arbitrary inhomogeneous quasi-1D bottom proﬁle.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of water waves is one of the classical ﬁelds
of the hydrodynamics, and it has been studied exten-
sively over many years. Starting from the middle of 90-s,
in the theory of two-dimensional (2D) potential ﬂows of
an ideal ﬂuid with a free surface, the so called confor-
mal variables have been actively employed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
With these variables, highly nonlinear equations of mo-
tion for planar water waves can be written in an exact
and compact form containing integral operators diago-
nal in the Fourier representation. Such integrodiﬀeren-
tial equations are very suitable for numerical simulation,
because eﬀective computer programs for the discrete fast
Fourier transform (FFT) are now available (see, e.g., [6]).
Based on these equations, a signiﬁcant progress has been
achieved in the study of nonlinear dynamics of water
waves, including the mechanism of sudden formation of
the giant waves [7, 8]. Recently, the exact 2D descrip-
tion has been generalized to the case of a highly space-
and time-inhomogeneous bottom proﬁle [9, 10]. However,
the real water waves are never ideally two-dimensional.
Therefore there is a need of a theory, which could describe
strongly nonlinear, even breaking waves and, from the
other hand, it would take into account 3D eﬀects, at least
as weak corrections. In present work such a highly non-
linear weakly 3D theory is suggested as an extension of
the exact 2D theory. It should be emphasized that exist-
ing approximate nonlinear evolution equations for water
waves, for example the famous Kadomtsev-Petviashvily
equation, equations of Boussinesq type [11], or the equa-
tions obtained by Matsuno [12], are valid just for weakly
nonlinear water waves, but not for overturning or break-
ing waves.

It is a well known fact that a very signiﬁcant diﬃculty
in the 3D theory of potential water waves is the general
impossibility to solve the Laplace equation for the veloc-
ity potential ϕ(x, y, q, t),

ϕxx + ϕyy + ϕqq = 0,

in the ﬂow region −H(x, q) ≤ y ≤ η(x, q, t) between the
(static for simplicity) bottom and a time-dependent free
surface, with the given boundary conditions

ϕ|y=η(x,q,t) = ψ(x, q, t),

(∂ϕ/∂n)|y=−H(x,q) = 0.

(Here x and q are the horizontal Cartesian coordinates,
y is the vertical coordinate, while the symbol z will be
used for the complex combination z = x + iy). There-
fore a compact expression is absent for the Hamiltonian

In the traditional approach, the problem is partly
solved by an asymptotic expansion of the kinetic energy
K on a small parameter — the slope of the surface (see
[13, 15], and references therein). As the result, a weakly
nonlinear theory arises, which is not good to describe
large-amplitude waves (see [16] for a discussion about the
limits of such theory). The theory developed in present
work is based on another small parameter — the ratio
of a typical length of the waves propagating along the
x-axis, to a large scale along the transversal horizontal
direction, denoted by q. Thus, we deﬁne ǫ = (lx/lq)2 ≪ 1
and note: the less this parameter, the less our ﬂow diﬀers
from a purely 2D ﬂow. The proﬁle y = η(x, q, t) of the

free surface, the boundary value of the velocity poten-
tial ψ(x, q, t) ≡ ϕ(x, η(x, q, t), q, t), and a given bottom
proﬁle y = −H(x, q) are allowed to depend strongly on
the coordinate x, while the derivatives over the coordi-
|ηq| ∼ ǫ1/2, |ψq| ∼ ǫ1/2,
nate q will be supposed small:
|Hq| ∼ ǫ1/2.

The paper is organized as follows. Sec. II is devoted
to a general description of the present approach. In Sec.
III, an explicit expression for the ﬁrst-order correction
K(1) is obtained, thus we can take into account, in the
main approximation, weak 3D eﬀects.

II. GENERAL IDEA OF THE METHOD

In the same manner as in the exact 2D theory [9, 10],
instead of the Cartesian coordinates x and y, we use
curvilinear conformal coordinates u and v, which make
the free surface and the bottom eﬀectively ﬂat:

x+iy ≡ z = z(u+iv, q, t), −∞ < u < +∞,

0 ≤ v ≤ 1,
(6)
where z(w, q, t) is an analytical on the complex variable
w ≡ u + iv function without any singularities in the ﬂow
region 0 ≤ v ≤ 1. Now the bottom corresponds to v = 0,
while on the free surface v = 1. The boundary value of
the velocity potential is ϕ|v=1 ≡ ψ(u, q, t). In the case of
a non-horizontal curved bottom, it is convenient to repre-
sent the conformal mapping z(w, q, t) as a composition of
two conformal mappings w 7→ ζ 7→ z, similarly to works
[9, 10]:

z(w, q, t) = Z(ζ(w, q, t), q).

(7)

Here the intermediate function ζ(w, q, t) possesses the
property Im ζ(u + 0i, q, t) = 0, thus resulting in the im-
portant relation

ζ(u + i, q, t) ≡ ξ(u, q, t) = (1 + i ˆR)ρ(u, q, t),
(8)
where ρ(u, q, t) is a purely real function, and ˆR = i tanh ˆk
(here ˆk ≡ −i ˆ∂u) is the anti-Hermitian operator, which
it multiplies
is diagonal in the Fourier representation:
ρ(u, q, t)e−ikudu by
the Fourier-harmonics ρk(q, t) ≡
Rk = i tanh k, so that

ˆRρ(u, q, t) =

2π

Z
= P.V.

Z

ρ(˜u, q, t) d˜u

.

(9)

(P.V. means the principal value integral.) A known an-
alytical function Z(ζ, q) determines parametrically the
static bottom proﬁle:

X [b](r, q) + iY [b](r, q) = Z(r, q),

(10)

where r is a real parameter running from −∞ to +∞.
The proﬁle of the free surface is now given (in the para-
metric form as well) by the formula

X [s](u, q, t)+iY [s](u, q, t) ≡ Z [s](u, q, t) = Z(ξ(u, q, t), q).
(11)

For equations to be more short, below we do not indicate
the arguments (u, q, t) of the functions ψ, ξ ¯ξ (the over-
line denotes the complex conjugate). Also, we introduce
the notation Z ′(ξ) ≡ ∂ξZ(ξ, q). The Lagrangian of the
system in the variables ψ, ξ, and ¯ξ can be re-written as
follows (compare to [9]):

where the indeﬁnite real Lagrangian multiplier Λ(u, q, t)
has been introduced in order to take into account the
relation (8). Equations of motion follow from the varia-
tional principle δA = 0, with the action A ≡
Ldt. So,
the variation by δψ gives us the ﬁrst equation of motion

Let us divide this equation by |Z ′(ξ)|2|ξu|2 and use the

we obtain the time-derivative-resolved equation

(cid:20)
where the linear operator ˆT ≡ ˆR−1 = −i coth ˆk has been
introduced. Further, the variation of the action A by δξ
gives us the second equation of motion:

Equations (14) and (18) completely determine the evo-
lution of the system, provided the kinetic energy func-
tional K{ψ, Z, ¯Z} is explicitly given. It should be empha-
sized that in our description a general expression for K re-
mains unknown. However, under the conditions |zq| ≪ 1,
|ϕq| ≪ 1, the potential ϕ(u, v, q, t) is eﬃciently expanded
into a series on the powers of the small parameter ǫ:

ϕ = ϕ(0) + ϕ(1) + ϕ(2) + . . . ,

ϕ(n) ∼ ǫn,

(19)

where ϕ(n+1) can be calculated from ϕ(n), and the
zeroth-order term ϕ(0) = Re φ(w, q, t) is the real part of
an easily represented (in integral form) analytical func-
tion with the boundary conditions Re φ|v=1 = ψ(u, q, t),
Im φ|v=0 = 0. Correspondingly, the kinetic energy func-
tional will be written in the form

K = K(0) + K(1) + K(2) + . . . ,

and other terms are corrections due to gradients along q.

Consequently, the Laplace equation in the new coordi-

with the boundary conditions

ϕ|v=1 = ψ(u, q, t),

[ϕv + bJ(ϕq + aϕu + bϕv)]|v=0 = 0.
(24)
Under the condition ǫ ≪ 1 it is possible to write the
solution as the series (19), with the zeroth-order term
satisfying the 2D Laplace equation

and (δK/δZ) ≈ (δK(1)/δZ) into the equations of motion

Z ′(ξ)ξu, Zq = Z ′(ξ)ξq + ∂qZ, Z [b] = Z([cosh ˆk]−1ρ, q),
and so on. Thus, the weakly 3D equations of motion are
completely derived, and our main goal is achieved.

The answers are more compact in the limit |k| ≫ 1,
corresponding to the “deep water”, when ˆR → ˆH, ˆT →

this case K(1)

[b] → 0, and therefore

After appropriate rescaling of the variable u, we can write

Z = u + (i − ˆH)Y (u, q, t),

Zu = 1 + (i − ˆH)Yu.

IV. SUMMARY

.

Thus, now we have nonlinear evolution equations for
weakly 3D steep water waves, as for deep water case,
as for arbitrary quasi-1D bottom proﬁle. The obtained
equations are intended to describe, for example, the sud-
den formation of giant waves in open sea, as well as over-
turning waves on a beach. The following step should be
development of an eﬃcient numerical method for simu-
lation these equations.

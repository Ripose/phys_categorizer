Comment on “Dynamical Foundations of Nonex-
tensive Statistical Mechanics”

In a recent letter [1], Christian Beck described a the-
oretical link between a family of stochastic diﬀerential
equations and the probability density functions (PDF)
derived from the formalism of nonextensive statistical
mechanics. He applied the theory to explain experimen-
tally measured PDFs from fully developed ﬂuid turbu-
lence. One of the comparisons was with the acceleration
a of ﬂuid particles. He found that the PDF

variance 1) captured the experimental data [2, 3] well.

Here we present new experimental results with better
statistics which show that equation (1) does not capture
the experimental observations. As in the earlier experi-
ment [2, 3], we used silicon strip detectors to follow the
motion of 45 µm diameter tracer particles at 70,000 mea-
surements per second at a spatial resolution of 1/5000.
By upgrading the data acquisition computers it was now
possible to collect data 3 times faster. In addition, we ran
the experiment uninterrupted for two weeks at a Tay-
lor based Reynolds number Rλ is 690. The ﬂow and
the other experimental conditions were the same as ear-
lier [2, 3]. The Kolmogorov time is τη = 0.93 ms. To
remove measurement noise, the trajectories were lowpass-
ﬁltered with a gaussian kernel of width 0.17τη. This was
faster and gave the same results as the ﬁtting procedure
used earlier [3]. The total number of data points gathered
is 1.7 × 108 (including the old data). Figure 1 displays
the experimental PDF together with the stretched expo-
nential ﬁt used in our earlier work:

with β = 0.513, γ = 1.600, σ = 0.563 and C is a nor-
malization constant. These numbers are slightly diﬀerent
from those reported in [3] due to the improved accuracy
of the PDF estimation. As can be seen, the ﬁt agrees
well with the PDF of a as well as with a4P (a).

Also shown in Fig. 1 by the dashed line is the ﬁt from
Eq. 1. Clearly the ﬁt does not correctly capture the tails
of the PDF. This is most clearly seen when the contribu-
tions a4P (a) to the fourth order moment are considered.
One consequence of the experiment is that the fourth or-
der moment of the experimental data converges and we
ﬁnd a ﬂatness factor of 55 ± 4.

In summary, the linear model proposed by C. Beck [1]
is not suﬃcient to reproduce our experimental data. It re-
mains to be seen whether other non-extensive statistical
mechanics approaches [4, 5, 6] lead to better agreement.

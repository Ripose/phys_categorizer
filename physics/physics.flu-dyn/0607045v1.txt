The evolution of large-scale density perturbations is studied in stably stratiﬁed, two-dimensional
ﬂow governed by the Boussinesq equations. As is known, intially smooth density (or temperature)
proﬁles develop into fronts in the very early stages of evolution. This results in the establishment
of a frontally dominated k−1 potential energy spectrum, and the signature of these fronts is also
apparent in the saturation of higher-order structure functions. The fronts, initially characterized
by a relatively simple geometry, spontaneously develop into severely distorted sheets that possess
structure at very ﬁne scales, and thus there is a transfer of energy from large to small scales. It
is shown here that this process culminates in the establishment of a dimensionally anticipated
k−5/3 kinetic energy spectrum, although its scaling extends over a shorter range as compared to
the k−1 scaling of the potential energy spectrum. The establishment of the kinetic energy scaling
signals the onset of enstrophy decay which proceeds in a mildly modulated exponential manner
and possesses a novel self-similarity. Speciﬁcally, the self-similarity is seen in the time invariant
nature of the probability density function (PDF) associated with the normalized vorticity ﬁeld.
Given the decaying nature of the problem, the kinetic energy spectral scaling is transient and
fades with the emergence of a smooth, large-scale, slowly decaying, (almost) vertically sheared
horizontal mode — i.e. the Pearson-Linden regime. Interestingly, the invariance of the PDF per-
sists despite the change in nature of the ﬂow from the turbulent regime to the Pearson-Linden regime.

INTRODUCTION

2

Large-scale geophysical ﬂows usually evolve under the constraints of stable stratiﬁcation and rotation. Indeed, it
is known that both of these constraints, individually and in concert, profoundly aﬀect the motion of a ﬂuid [1]. Here
we restrict our attention to the stratiﬁed problem (see [2] for a review). In particular, we study the adjustment of a
two-dimensional stably stratiﬁed Boussinesq ﬂuid to imposed large-scale density perturbations.

Starting with the work of Riley, Metcalfe & Weissman [3], there have been numerous studies of three-dimensional
stably stratiﬁed ﬂows in both forced and decaying scenarios that indicate a spontaneous generation of layered
structures from initially isotropic ﬁelds (see for example [4],[5],[6]). More importantly, the three-dimensional stratiﬁed
problem possesses a distinct zero frequency vortex mode along with the slow gravity wave modes [7]. Indeed, the
relative importance of diﬀerent interactions — such as the catalytic slow-fast-fast resonant interaction wherein the
vortex mode is unaltered but mediates transfer between the fast gravity waves [7], the interaction between the vortex
modes themselves [5] and the near resonant transfer at small Froude numbers into the slow wave modes [6] — is
a subject of active research. In fact the partitioning of energy between the fast and balanced components in the
general rotating stratiﬁed problem is an outstanding problem in atmospheric dynamics (for example Ford et. al [8]
and the references therein). It may be instructive to understand how energy re-distribution proceeds in the relatively
simpliﬁed, two-dimensional system. Interestingly, the two-dimensional system no longer possesses a distinct vortex
mode and presents a situation wherein one can study the interaction of ”unbalanced” components in isolation. A
related issue is the fact that potential vorticity is identically zero in two dimensions. A future goal is to understand if
and how the constraint of potential vorticity conservation in three-dimensional ﬂows alters unbalanced interactions.

With regards to the two-dimensional problem, detailed numerical work was carried out by Bouret-Aubertot,
Sommeria & Staquet [9] wherein a bounded domain with no-ﬂow conditions was considered. Focussing on the
instabilities suﬀered by prescribed ﬂows, they showed that the wave-wave interactions result in a transfer of energy
from large to small scales (see also Orlanski & Cerasoli [10]). Their analysis of imposed standing gravity waves
indicated that these waves necessarily break after a ﬁnite time (depending on the initial amplitude) and the spectral
redistribution of energy proceeds via the so-called wave-turbulence paradigm [11]. Here we lift the no ﬂow condition
by considering the problem in a periodic domain and pursue the time evolution from a state of rest and for a much
longer duration. As one might anticipate, the aforementioned wave-breaking is one stage in the overall scheme of
things.

Apart from geophysical motivations, the system under consideration is part of an extended family of ﬂows — the
so-called dynamically active scalars [12],[13]. In particular, statistical properties of the neutral and unstably stratiﬁed
Boussinesq systems have been the subject of recent investigations [14],[15],[16] and the present work, wherein the
system additionally supports waves, can be viewed as a continuation of these eﬀorts. Further, given the possibility of
a ﬁnite-time breakdown of regularity in a two-dimensional setting, these problems are of considerable mathematical
interest and the reader inclined to pursue such matters is referred to Cordoba & Feﬀerman [17] (and the references
therein) for a recent overview.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows : we ﬁrst provide the basic equations and conservation laws
along with the setup of the numerical experiment. Next we touch brieﬂy upon the initial stages of evolution that
have been well documented in existing literature. We then proceed to the focus of the paper where we see the
establishment of a k−1 and k−5/3 scaling for the potential and kinetic energy respectively, the onset of nearly
exponential decay of enstrophy and the establishment of an invariant normalized vorticity PDF. Due to the decaying
nature of the problem, the spectra are seen to gradually shift downwards, their scaling becomes less distinct, and
ﬁnally we see the emergence of a slowly decaying, vertically sheared, large-scale, predominantly horizontal mode as
elucidated by Pearson & Linden [18]. Interestingly, the PDF established as the enstrophy decay sets in persists well
into the last stages of evolution. We conclude by summarizing the various stages and put forth a conjecture regarding
fate of stratiﬁed adjustment in the inviscid limit.

The equations governing two-dimensional stratiﬁed ﬂow under the Boussinesq approximation are [19]

state is in hydrostatic balance, i.e. ∂pb/∂z = −ρbg. The temperature and density are related via ρ = ρo[1 + α(T0 − T )],
and thus the basic state temperature proﬁle is Tb = T0 + ˆT (z) with ˆT (z) = − ˆρ(z)/(αρo). System (1) results from
the assumption ρ′, ˆρ(z) << ρ0. As ρo, λ, g, α are constants we consider the perturbed ﬁelds (~u, p′, ρ′, θ) in a periodic

Note that even though the problem is in a two-dimensional setting, in contrast to the usual situation [21] the vorticity
in (2) is not a Lagrangian invariant. This indicates that the familiar two-dimensional inverse cascade of energy is
unlikely to be realised as it relies, amongst other things, on the dual conservation of energy and enstrophy [21]. Also,
in comparison to the free-convective case (i.e. λ = 0) [14],[16], functions of the form f (θ) are not conserved by (2).
Hence an immediate direct cascade of θ2 is unlikely. Introducing dissipation via the usual kinematic viscosity and
diﬀusivity (both taken to be γ) — i.e. γ∇2ω and γ∇2θ in (2) — we have

So for γ > 0, ∂E

monotonically decreasing function of time, the enstrophy (and higher moments of ω) can show a signiﬁcant increase
before ﬁnally decaying away.

III. THE NUMERICAL EXPERIMENT

To study the process of adjustment, we start with an initial state at rest and in hydrostatic balance to which is
imposed a large scale θ perturbation. System (2) is solved in a 2π periodic domain using a de-aliased pseudo-spectral
method. Deﬁning the Froude (F r) and Reynolds (Re) numbers as F r = u/N L and Re = u/γL respectively, and
taking N to be an O(1) quantity, we impose an initial θ perturbation such that the total energy is also an O(1)

entity. Apriori we expect the following stages of evolution : as the ﬂuid starts from rest, initially both F r, Re ≪ 1
— i.e. we have a laminar ﬂow that is strongly constrained by stratiﬁcation. Since γ is small, as soon as a certain
fraction of the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy implying max (u) ∼ 1, we have F r ∼ 1, Re ≫ 1 — i.e.
a turbulent ﬂow that is weakly constrained by stratiﬁcation. Finally, because γ > 0 the ﬁelds must eventually decay
so that we enter a diﬀusion and stratiﬁcation dominated regime.

Fig. (1) shows the evolution of energy — total, potential (

D[u2 + w2]) — and enstrophy
λ θ2) and kinetic (
with time. Focussing on the early stages of development shown in the ﬁrst column of Fig. (2), as predicted from linear
R
theory we see the generation of gravity waves that mediate the exchange of energy between the potential and kinetic
components. Indeed, simulations with diﬀering initial conditions and variations in the strength of stratiﬁcation follow
qualitatively similar paths though the quantitative partition of energy between the potential and kinetic components
is not identical in all situations. Further, at very early times (t < 2s), all gradient ﬁelds are quite mild and the
evolution is fairly inviscid. Along with this laminar evolution, the upper panel of Fig. (3) shows the emergence of
frontal structures in the vertical direction. Moreover, this frontal development is accompanied by increasing vertical
shear and, even though this is not a steady ﬂow, the accompanying decrease in Richardson number hints at the
onset of instability.
In fact, as noted in previous studies such a situation necessarily leads to wave-breaking [9].
In physical space we begin to see the fronts evolving into highly convoluted sheets and the wave-wave interactions
result in a redistribution energy from large to small scales [9],[10]. Of course as small-scale structures are being
created, we see that the relatively inviscid behaviour seen for t < 2s ceases and dissipation of energy begins to increase.

B. Enstrophy decay, invariant PDFs and spectral scaling

Proceeding to the focus of this communication, from Fig. (1) we notice a marked change in the behaviour of the
enstrophy as the fronts become severely distorted. Speciﬁcally the enstrophy, which grew during the initial front
formation and subsequent development (till t ≈ 7s), now decays in a fairly monotonic manner. Examining the
enstrophy in detail (see the log plot in Fig. (4)), we notice that the primary signature of the decay is exponential
along with a secondary small amplitude modulation. In fact, Fig. (5) shows the vorticity ﬁeld well after the enstrophy
attains it maximum value (see the ﬁgure captions for the exact times of the snapshots); as is expected via the
non-conservation of vorticity from (2), we do not see successive mergers resulting in large-scale structures, but rather
the vorticity ﬁeld continues to consist of distinct blobs separated by sharp ridges of concentrated enstrophy dissipation.

Motivated by a somewhat similar scenario in the decaying passive scalar problem [24],[25],[26] — where the decay
(of the passive ﬁeld) is purely exponential — we consider the normalized variable X = ω/Q1/2, where Q =< ω2 >
and < · > denotes spatial averaging. From (2) and (4), after performing a spatial average, the equation governing
< X 2n > is

In the passive scalar problem, X = φ/Q

1/2
where Q1 =< (∇ω)2 > and Q2 =< ω ∂θ
p where φ denotes the
passive ﬁeld and Qp =< φ2 >. In that case the purely exponential decay of < φ2 > (and higher moments) led to
= 0 and consequently PDF(X) attained an invariant proﬁle [25],[26]. However in the present case, the
∂<X
∂t
moments in (5) inherit the secondary modulation from < ω2 > and ﬂuctuate about a mean.
In fact, as all the
moments have the same temporal ﬂuctuations, the entire PDF is expected to attain an invariant shape but will
exhibit small shifts in magnitude. The extracted PDFs — see Fig. (6) — are plotted in three groups. The upper
panel focusses on early times (t < 7s) and shows the approach to self-similarity.
Interestingly, this approach is
characterized by a gradual decrease in intermittency, i.e. the PDFs in the initial stages of evolution are extremely fat
tailed — either stretched exponentials or power laws keeping in mind the diﬃculty in distinguishing between these
two functions [27],[26] — whereas the self-similar time invariant PDFs (lower panel of Fig. (6)) are purely exponential.

5

The two bunches of curves in the lower panel of Fig. (6) show the PDFs for the approximate intervals spanning
t ∈ [10, 20] and t ∈ [20, 40], respectively. From (5) we expect the PDFs to shift, though maintaining their shape,
as < X 2n > ﬂuctuates with time. These shifts are in fact very small and quite diﬃcult to discern in the lower
panel of Fig. (6). As is evident both these bunches show the same invariant PDF. The reason behind the diﬀerent
grouping is that the nature of the ﬂow — as is elucidated in the following — is quite diﬀerent in these two time intervals.

The lower two panels of Fig. (3) show the θ ﬁeld corresponding to the vorticity snapshots in Fig. (5) — notice that
even though the frontal structures persist, the fronts are oriented in a fairly isotropic manner. In eﬀect the picture
that emerges is, as the frontal structures become unstable (t ≈ 2s), energy that was trapped at larger scales during
the very early stages of evolution begins to ﬁll out the entire available range of scales. This ”ﬁlling out” proceeds —
from t ≈ 2 − 7s — until one achieves a state wherein the kinetic energy spectrum is close to dimensionally expected
k−5/3 scaling while the potential energy continues to scale as k−1 (though at slightly larger scales) — this can be seen
in Fig. (7) which shows the kinetic and potential energy spectra from t ≈ 7s onwards. Of course as is seen in Fig. (7),
the spectra gradually shift downwards as the total energy is decaying, the diﬀusive roll-oﬀ extends to larger scales
and the scaling becomes less distinct (especially in the kinetic energy) as the ﬁelds become progressively smoother —
indeed, the PDFs grouped in the upper bunch of the lower panel of Fig. (6) represent the interval wherein the ﬂow
is experiencing these changes.

The behaviour of the potential energy spectrum is a consequence of geometry. Speciﬁcally, even though the fronts
become unstable they retain much of their identity, i.e. instead of being smoothed out, the fronts evolve into highly
distorted sheets (see the middle and lower panels of Fig. (3)).
In fact, these step-like features (the remnants of
the fronts) continue to dominate the potential energy spectrum resulting in the k−1 scaling [22], [23]. Given the
importance of these frontal structures, in accordance with the free and unstably stratiﬁed active scalar cases [15],[16],
we expect the higher moments of the θ ﬁeld to be quite anomalous with a possible saturation of high-order structure
functions. Indeed deﬁning the structure functions as Sq(|~r|) =< |θ(~x + ~r) − θ(~x)|q >, we see that Sq(r) ∼ rζq with
ζq < qζ1; in particular as is seen in Fig. (8), ζq → constant for large q.

C. Final stage : vertically sheared horizontal ﬂows (a Pearson-Linden regime)

Returning to the energetics of the ﬂow, Fig. (1) indicates that at very long times, i.e. t > 20s, the total energy
reverts to an extremely slow decay. Further, in this stage almost all of the energy in the system is in the potential
component (see also the third column of Fig. (2)). The minute amount of kinetic energy indicates that a dissipative
linear analysis would be appropriate — in fact, we are precisely in the last stages of decaying stratiﬁed turbulence as
elucidated by Pearson & Linden [18] (their analysis was more detailed with diﬀusivity 6= viscosity). Substituting a
Fourier decomposition into the dissipative linearized form of (2), we have

ψ(~x, t) =

Z

ˆψ(~k) exp{i(kxx + kzz)} exp{−γK

t} exp{±i

(λαg)t} d~k.

K p

The oscillatory nature of the exponential results in a dominance of the integral by modes with kx ≈ 0. Further, at
long times a subset of these modes with the smallest rate of decay will remain. Hence we are left with a ﬂow wherein
w ≈ 0, u = u(z) and θ = θ(z), i.e. vertically sheared horizontal ﬂows with vertical structure restricted to the smallest
wavenumbers (largest scales) as is seen in Fig. (9). This is precisely the ﬂow that corresponds to the PDFs grouped
in the lower bunch of the lower panel of Fig. (6).

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have studied the evolution of large-scale density (temperature) perturbations in the two-dimensional, stably
stratiﬁed Boussinesq equations. The advantage of starting from a state of rest is the observation of various stages
through which the system naturally evolves as governed by the Froude and Reynolds numbers. Starting from a
smooth proﬁle, we immediately observe the formation of sharp fronts resulting in the establishment of a frontally
dominated k−1 potential energy spectrum; the signature of the fronts is also clearly seen in the severely anomalous

6

behaviour of the higher order temperature structure functions. Further, the fronts spontaneously evolve into highly
convoluted sheets accompanied by a spectral re-distribution of energy that culminates in the establishment of a
dimensionally anticipated k−5/3 kinetic energy spectrum. Given the monotonic decay of energy, the establishment of
the aforementioned scaling is followed by a gradual downward shift in the spectra, the scaling becomes less distinct
as the ﬁelds become progressively smoother and ﬁnally there emerges a slowly decaying, vertically sheared, almost
horizontal mode wherein most of the energy is trapped in the potential component — i.e. the Pearson-Linden regime.

With regards to the vorticity, the early stages of front formation and energy re-distribution are accompanied by
a rapid increase in enstrophy.
Indeed, as the kinetic energy scaling is established we see the onset of an almost
monotonic decay of enstrophy. In particular, the decay is primarily exponential with a secondary small amplitude
modulation. Examining the normalized vorticity ﬁeld, motivated by an analogous scenario in the decaying passive
scalar problem, shows it to be characterized by an invariant exponential PDF. Interestingly the PDF maintains its
invariance and the enstrophy continues to decay in an almost exponential manner even though the nature of the ﬂow
evolves from one where the kinetic and potential energy spectra have a well deﬁned scaling to one that is a smooth
vertically sheared horizontal mode.

An interesting aspect of this problem is the inviscid limit, i.e. γ → 0. If the active scalar system maintains its
∂t = 0. However, this does not imply γ < (∇ω)2 >→ 0.
regularity i.e. |∇θ|, |∇u|, |∇w| < ∞, then as γ → 0 we expect ∂E
In fact, given that the ﬂow will not decay, we conjecture that the decay of enstrophy and the associated invariant
PDFs will be established but the ﬂow will never enter the Pearson-Linden regime. Further, the potential energy
spectrum is expected to follow a k−1 scaling due to the presence of fronts, whereas the scaling of the kinetic energy is
problematic due to a lack of dissipation. In fact, it is quite possible to end up with equipartition leading to a pile up
of kinetic energy in the largest available wavenumbers [28]. On the other hand, if the system loses its regularity then
∂E
∂t < 0 even in the limit γ → 0, and the system should behave as in the presently studied situation with ﬁxed γ > 0.

An obvious extension of the present work is the consideration of the fully three-dimensional (and also possibly
rotating) problem — as mentioned in the introduction, the issue of balance and the spontaneous generation of
imbalanced (or fast) waves is an active area of work [8].
Indeed, it would be intriguing to explore whether the
unbalanced components in the fully three-dimensional problem aﬀord a self-similar treatment.

in the diﬀerent stages. The ﬁrst column shows the relatively inviscid evolution (till about t ≈ 2s) followed by the generation
of small scale structures. The second column starts with well deﬁned spectral scaling of the KE and PE and signals the onset
of enstrophy decay. The third column shows the slowly decaying Pearson-Linden regime where most of the energy is in the
potential component. Lower Panel : Corresponding enstrophy plots.

FIG. 3: Snapshots of the temperature ﬁeld, with reference to the Fig. (1) these are at t = 1.89, 3.43, 10.65, 11.63, 12.55, 13.64
seconds respectively. The emergence and distortion of the fronts can be seen in the upper panel showing snapshots taken at
t = 1.89s and t = 3.43s respectively. The middle panel corresponds to times when the spectral scaling of the PE and KE are
quite clear. Further in both the middle and lower panels, even though the frontal structures persist, they are oriented in a
fairly isotropic fashion. This is reﬂected in the identical nature of the power spectra extracted from 1D cuts oriented in both
the vertical and horizontally directions (see Fig.(7)).

FIG. 5: Snapshots of the vorticity ﬁeld (corresponding to the lower two panels of Fig. (3)) when the decay of enstrophy has
set in. Note the ﬁeld consists of blobs of vorticity separated by ridges of intense enstrophy dissipation.

FIG. 6: PDFs of the normalized vorticity ﬁeld. The upper panel shows the approach to a self-similar proﬁle, note the decrease
in intermittency with time. The two bunches of curves in the lower panel consists of proﬁles evenly spanning t ∈ [10.9, 19.2] sec
and t ∈ [20.7, 40.5] sec respectively. The upper bunch represents the interval during which the energy spectra gradually change
over from having a well deﬁned scaling to a smooth nature. Similarly the lower bunch shows the invariance of the PDF even
as the ﬁeld enters the Pearson-Linden regime.

FIG. 7: Spectra of the kinetic and potential energy from 1D cuts of the θ, u, w ﬁelds. The cuts are made in the vertical and
horizontal directions and the scaling is identical in both the cases (these plots are the averages of the two cases). The two
bunches of curves have been shifted for clarity. The kinetic energy attains k−5/3 scaling by about t ≈ 7s. After which we see
the the gradual downward shift of the spectra, the extension of the diﬀusive roll-oﬀ to larger scales and the scaling becomes
progressively less distinct. Speciﬁcally, the plots are at t = 7.8, 9.6, 12.1, 15.2 secs respectively.

FIG. 9: The establishment of a quasi-horizontal temperature ﬁeld as we enter the ﬁnal stages of decay — i.e. a Pearson-Linden

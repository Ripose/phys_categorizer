Abstract

A basic aspect of the kinetic descriptions of incompressible ﬂuids based on an inverse
kinetic approaches is the possibility of satisfying an H-theorem. This property is in
fact related to the identiﬁcation of the kinetic distribution function with a proba-
bility density in an appropriate phase space. Goal of this investigation is to analyze
the conditions of validity of an H-theorem for the inverse kinetic theory recently
proposed by Ellero and Tessarotto [2004, 2005]. It is found that the time-dependent
contribution to the kinetic pressure, characteristic of such a kinetic model, can al-
ways be uniquely deﬁned in such a way to warrant the constancy of the entropy.

1 Introduction

The possibility of deﬁning an inverse kinetic theory for the 3D incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations (INSE; see Appendix A), recently pointed out [1,
2, 3] raises the interesting question whether the relevant kinetic distribution
function satisﬁes an H-theorem, namely the related (Shannon) kinetic entropy
can be speciﬁed in such a way to result monotonically non-decreasing in time
for arbitrary ﬂuid ﬁelds deﬁned in a internal domain, to be identiﬁed with
a bounded three-dimensional domain Ω ⊆ R3 (ﬂuid domain). The validity
of such a theorem is in fact a suﬃcient condition of strict positivity of the

distribution function. Therefore, this result is important in order to establish
also the consequent interpretation of the kinetic distribution function, to be
suitably normalized, in terms of a probability density on an appropriate phase
space Γ.

Purpose of this Note is to evaluate the kinetic entropy and the related entropy
production rate for strictly positive, suitably smooth, but otherwise arbitrary,
distribution functions f (x,t) which correspond to an arbitrary strong solution
of the initial-boundary value problem of INSE (see Appendix A and Refs.[3,
4]), deﬁned for an internal domain of R3, and for kinetic distributions functions
which are not necessarily Maxwellian. We intend to prove that, under a suit-
able assumptions, which involve the speciﬁcation of the only non-observable
free parameter of the theory, a strictly positive time-dependent additive con-
tribution to the kinetic pressure, the kinetic entropy results identically con-
served, thus yielding an H-theorem for the kinetic distribution function. The
conclusion is obtained invoking mild assumptions both on the initial kinetic
distribution function and on the ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρ(r, t) = ρo > 0, V(r, t), p(r, t)}.
In the sequel we intend to show that the proof of this statement, and hence
of the positivity of the kinetic distribution function, relies essentially only on
the following assumptions:

a) the strict positivity of the initial distribution function f (x,to) in the whole
phase space Γ;

b) the requirement that f (x,to) belongs to the functional class

f (x,to) ∈ C (1,1)(Ω × I),

and results suitably summable in Γ and smooth in Γ × I;

c) no-slip, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the ﬂuid ﬁelds (see
Appendix A);

d) the total mass of the ﬂuid is conserved, i.e.,

d3rρ(r, t) = M = const.

e) the ﬂuid is subject to a volume force density f(r,t) which is assumed suitably

with I denoting the time axis, generally to be identiﬁed with a ﬁnite subset
of R;

g) the determination of the time-dependent term of the kinetic pressure (p1).
It if found that p1 can always be deﬁned in the same time interval I, up to
an arbitrary positive constant, in such a way that the entropy production rate
vanishes identically.

The basic result can be summarized as follows.

Theorem 1 - H-theorem (entropy conservation for the inverse ki-
netic theory of INSE)

Let us denote by f (x(t),t) the kinetic distribution function solution, assumed
to exist and result suitably regular, of the inverse kinetic equation represented
in the form

f (x(t),t) = Tt,tof (xo,to),
(6)
x = (r, v) being a state vector belonging to the phase space Γ = Ω × U and
U = R3 the velocity space. f (xo,to), the initial kinetic distribution function,
is assumed to be suitably smooth in the sense of Eq.(1), strictly positive and
summable in Γ for appropriate weight functions. Moreover, Tt,to is a suitably-
deﬁned diﬀeomorphism, denoted as Navier-Stokes evolution operator, such that
∀t ∈ I, including the initial time to ∈ I, the ﬂuid ﬁelds at any time t ∈ I,
{ρo, V(r, t), p(r, t)} are uniquely deﬁned by the following velocity moments of
the kinetic distribution function:

ρo =

d3vf (x,t) = ρo =

d3vTt,tof (xo,to),

V(r,t) =

1) provided the initial distribution function f (xo,to) results strictly positive
and suitably smooth in the sense of (1), it follows that the velocity moments
3u2, uu, uE and
FG(r, t) =
u = v − V, exist, are continuous Ω × I and suitably smooth in Ω × I in the
sense of the settings (2),(3),(4) and (5). In addition, the kinetic entropy

(law of entropy conservation).

For greater clarity, in Sec.2 the relevant aspects of the inverse kinetic theory
previously developed are recalled [3]. This is useful to introduce the Navier-
Stoker evolution operator Tt,to and deﬁne the related probability density in the
phase space Γ. As a consequence, it is immediate to prove that Tt,to conserves
probability in the same space. Subsequently, in Sec. 3, the kinetic entropy
the S(t) and its time derivative ∂S(t)/∂t are evaluated. It is found that by
suitably deﬁning the non-negative kinetic pressure (p1) the entropy production
rate can always be set equal to zero in the whole time interval I in which by
assumption a strong solution of INSE exists. Implications of the result are
pointed out.

2 The Navier-Stokes evolution operator

In this Section we brieﬂy recall the formulation of the inverse kinetic theory
developed in [3]. This is useful in order to identify the Navier-Stokes evolution
operator Tt,to which determines the evolution of the relevant kinetic distribu-
tion function f (x, t) in the extended phase space Γ × I ( where Γ ≡ Ω × U ,
with U ≡ R3 denoting a suitable ”velocity” space).

The result is obtained by requiring the f (x, t) obeys a Vlasov kinetic equation
of the form

L(F)f = 0,
(13)
where x ≡ (r, v) is a state vector spanning the phase space Γ, L the streaming
operator

and X a vector ﬁeld of the form X(x,t)= {v, F(x, t)} . This equation can for-
mally be written in integral form by introducing the initial kinetic distribution
function f (xo, to) ≡ fo(xo), deﬁned at the initial time to ∈ I, and the ﬂow,
i.e., the the diﬀeomorphism xo → x(t) =Tt,toxo generated by the vector ﬁeld
X, via the initial-value problem

and its related evolution operator Tt,to (Navier-Stokes evolution operator ).
This implies that provided the solution of the initial-value problem exists, is
unique and suitably smooth, the Jacobian of the ﬂow xo → x(t), J(x(t),t) ≡

Previously it has been shown [4] that the functional form of the vector ﬁeld

INSE can be uniquely determined under suitable prescriptions. These include,
in particular, the requirements that:

satisfy INSE;

2) suitable bounce-back boundary conditions are imposed for the kinetic dis-
tribution function on the boundary δΩ [3];

3) the moment equations corresponding to the velocity moments MG(r, t) =
3u2 coincide with the diﬀerential

4) the ﬂuid ﬁelds ρo and V(r, t) are identiﬁed respectively with the velocity
moments for G(x, t) = 1, v/ρo; similarly, the ﬂuid pressure p(r,t) is deﬁned in
terms of the kinetic pressure p1(r,t) [see Eq.(9)] by requiring

p(r,t) = p1(r,t) − Po.

(19)

It is obvious, in order that ∇p = ∇p1, that Po can be in principle an arbitrary
strictly positive function independent of r. Thus it can always be assumed to
be ∀t ∈ I a smooth function of t. The resulting form of F(r, v,t) is recalled in

We stress that Eq.(31) holds, in principle, for an arbitrary initial condition

given by Eqs.(9) and (10), remains still non-unique since it is determined in
terms of Eq.(29) only up to an arbitrary positive constant Poo.

It follows that the Shannon entropy for the kinetic distribution function f (x,t)
results always conserved by imposing a suitable prescription on the the time-
dependent part of the kinetic pressure Po(t). Since the latter is unrelated to
the physical observables (i.e., the ﬂuid ﬁelds) the constraint condition imposed
on the kinetic pressure [respectively (29) or (30)] can always be satisﬁed. As
a consequence, with such prescriptions the normalized kinetic distribution
function

f (x, t) can be interpreted as probability density.

3.1 Conclusions

In this paper the condition of positivity of the kinetic distribution function
f (x, t) which characterizes the inverse kinetic theory recently developed for
the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations has been investigated [3, 4]. We
have proven that the Shannon entropy is exactly conserved for arbitrary ki-
netic distribution function, provided the kinetic pressure is suitably deﬁned
and the initial kinetic distribution function results positive deﬁnite and suit-
ably regular. As indicated, these conditions can always be satisﬁed without
imposing any constraint on the physical observables, here represented by the
ﬂuid ﬁelds {ρo, V,p} .

The conclusion applies in principle to arbitrary, suitable smooth in the sense
(5), strong solutions of INSE which are deﬁned in three dimensional internal
domains of R3. Assuming, mass conservation and no-slip boundary conditions
(i.e., Dirichlet boundary conditions) on the boundary δΩ, the same result
holds also for non-isolated systems characterized by moving boundaries. In
addition, arbitrary volume forces which satisfy (3),(4) or analogous surface
forces obtained by applying a non-uniform pressure on the boundary δΩ, can
be included.

An immediate consequence of the H-theorem here obtained is the possibility
of imposing the maximum entropy principle in order to determine the ini-
tial kinetic distribution function fo(x), i.e., requiring the variational equation
δS(fo) = 0 subject to suitable constraint equations. Thus, for example, the lo-
cal Maxwellian distribution (18) is obtained by imposing solely the constraints
provided by the moments (7),(8),(9) and (10), to be considered as prescribed.
However, in principle, the variational principle can also be used to determine
non-Maxwellian initial distributions [5].

These results appear signiﬁcant both from the mathematical viewpoint and
the physical interpretation of the theory.

bounded time interval I ⊂ R, while the last three inequalities, (35)-(37) ap-
ply also in the closure of the ﬂuid domain Ω ≡ Ω ∪ δΩ. Here the notation is
standard[3]. Hence D

cosity, with ν the related kinematic viscosity. The volume force density f(r,t)
acting on the ﬂuid element by assumption is taken in the functional setting
(3),(4) and (5). Consequently, the ﬂuid ﬁelds {V(r,t), p(r,t)} are required to
satisfy the regularity conditions (5). The initial-boundary value problem for
INSE is deﬁned as follows. The initial condition is deﬁned by imposing

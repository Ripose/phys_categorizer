Formation of singularities on the surface of a liquid metal in a

strong electric ﬁeld

The nonlinear dynamics of the free surface of an ideal conducting liquid in a strong

external electric ﬁeld is studied. It is establish that the equations of motion for such a

liquid can be solved in the approximation in which the surface deviates from a plane

by small angles. This makes it possible to show that on an initially smooth surface

for almost any initial conditions points with an inﬁnite curvature corresponding to

branch points of the root type can form in a ﬁnite time.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A ﬂat surface of a conducting liquid placed in a strong external electric ﬁeld is known
2 = 8π√gαρ,

[1, 2, 3] to become unstable if the ﬁeld strength E exceeds a critical value Ec

where g is the acceleration of free fall, α is the surface tension, and ρ is the density of the

medium. The interaction of the electric ﬁeld and the charges induced by this ﬁeld on the

surface of the liquid causes surface perturbations to grow rapidly and regions of substantial

curvature to form in a ﬁnite time [4, 5]. The result may be an increase in the ﬁeld energy

density at the surface, initialization of emission processes, and, ﬁnally, vacuum breakdown

[6]. Moreover, there are indication that the liquid phase plays an important role in the initial

stages of explosive electron emission [7]. All this means that one must build a meaningful

theoretical model of the nonlinear stages in the development of an instability, a model that

can be used to describe the formation of a singular proﬁle of the surface of the medium (a

liquid metal in applications).

The present paper studies the nonlinear dynamics of an electrohydrodynamic instability

in the limit of a strong electric ﬁeld, E

Ec, when both surface tension and gravity

can be ignored. The interest in this limit is due, in particular, to the recent discovery
1 kV cm−1 (Ref. [8]). The nonlinear
of systems with anomalously low critical ﬁelds, Ec ∼
stages in the development of an instability are studied by perturbation techniques that use

series expansions in a small parameter, the angle of the slope of the surface. Of course,

the introduction of such a small parameter makes it impossible to describe the formation

(observed in experiments) of strong singularities, with corresponding slope angles of order

unity. Nevertheless, using the model adopted in this paper, we can show that for almost

any initial conditions at the surface of the conducting liquid, it takes only a ﬁnite time for

points with inﬁnite curvature to form on the surface. Thus, even in the weakly nonlinear

stages in the development of a nonlinearity there is the tendency for a singular proﬁle of the

liquid surface to form.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we derive the main equations of motion,

which describe the evolution of the free surface of an ideal conducting liquid in a strong

external electric ﬁeld. In Sec. III we use the approximation of small angles characterizing the

slope of the surface to build a nonlinear model of the development of an electrohydrodynamic

instability. Section IV is devoted to a study of the dynamics of one-dimensional surface

perturbations. Integration of the model equations shows that it takes only a ﬁnite time for

weak singularities of the root type to form in the system, i.e., singular points at which the

curvature of surface is inﬁnite (see also the Letter [9]).

Mathematically, the formation of singularities can be explained by the violation of the

analyticity of the complex velocity potential due to the movement of singularities, or branch

points, to the boundary. On the whole, such behavior is similar to that of the velocity

potential of an ideal liquid in the absence of external forces [10, 11, 12]. In Sec. V we use the

example of the evolution of single perturbations to show that the formation of singularities

occurs before the small-angle condition is violated because of the development of a linear

instability (the branch point of the root type agrees with the small-angle approximation).

In Sec. VI we study the behavior of the boundary of a liquid metal under the assumption

that self-similarity is retained in a small neighborhood of a singularity in the crossover from

one-dimensional perturbations of the surface to arbitrary perturbations. Finally, in Sec. VII

we discuss the role that branch points of the root type play in the evolution of the system.

IV. FORMATION OF A BRANCH POINT OF THE ROOT TYPE

For further discussions it is convenient to introduce functions that are analytic in the

upper half-plane of the complex variable x:

φ = ˆP f,

χ = ˆP g,

where ˆP = (1

i ˆH)/2. Since applying the Hilbert operator to a function that is analytic in

the upper half-plane amounts to multiplying that function by the unit imaginary number,

Eqs. (8) and (9) take the form

For the sake of convenience we introduce a new function, v = φx. In terms of this function,

Eq. (11) becomes

Note that this equation coincides with the one proposed by Zhdanov and Trubnikov [15, 16],

who used it to describe the nonlinear stages in the development of tangential discontinuities

in hydrodynamics. More than that, if we replace x by x

x + it, we arrive at the equation

→

derived in Refs. [10, 11, 12] as a result of a discussion of the nonlinear dynamics of a free

surface of ideal liquid in the absence of external forces, where it describes the temporal

evolution of the complex-valued velocity. The solution of this ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential

equation can be found by using the method of characteristics:

x = x′ + it + 2Q(x′)t,

where the function Q is determined by the initial conditions Q(x) = v

Let us show, by analogy with Refs. [10, 11, 12], that these relations describe (if we require

that v be analytic) the formation of a singularity in a ﬁnite time. The problem of ﬁnding

the explicit solution reduces to analyzing the map x

this map ceases to be one-to-one at points where

→

∂x/∂x′ = 1 + 2Qx′t = 0.

(14)

The relationship (14) speciﬁes a path x′ = x′(t) in the complex x′ plane. Then the motion

of the branch point of the function v is given by

x(t) = x′(t) + it + 2Q(x′(t))t.

At the time t0 when the branch point reaches the real axis the analyticity of v is violated

and the solutions of Eq. (9) become singular.

Let us examine the behavior of the solutions near a singularity. Expanding (12) and (13)
0 = x′(t0), in the leading

in a small neighborhood of the point t = t0, x = x0 = x(t0), x′ = x′

Inserting (15) into this expression, we see than near the singularity the derivative χxx can

This means that the analyticity of χxx is violated at time t = t0.

How does the surface of the liquid metal behave at the time when the singularities develop

in the solutions of Eqs. (10) and (11)? Allowing for the fact that η = f

i.e., it takes a ﬁnite time for a singularity of root type (branch point) to form at the surface,

and the curvature of the surface of the liquid at this point is inﬁnite.

To conclude this section we note that since we have ψ = f + g, near the singularity a

relationship holds for the complex-valued potential of the liquid ﬂow, Ψ

i.e., the ﬁrst derivative of the complex-valued velocity also exhibits singular behavior as

[10, 11, 12], the formation of singularities can be

→

interpreted as the result of violation of the analyticity of the complex-valued potential due

to the movement of the singularities of the potential to the boundary.

V. EVOLUTION OF A SINGLE PERTURBATION

We use a simple example to show that at the time when a singularity in the solutions of

Eqs. (8) and (9) develops the applicability conditions for our model are met.

We take the initial perturbation in the form

f

|t=0 =

−

εamˆkm−1 ln(x2 + a2),

where m is a positive integer, and the parameters a and ε take positive values a > 0 and

ε > 0. This situation corresponds to a one-dimensional single perturbation of the surface

symmetric with respect to point x = 0, at which the surface curvature is negative. The

characteristic slope angles of the surface are determined by the parameter ε, which we

9

(18)

assume small.

Note that in the linear approximation Eq. (9) becomes

ft + ˆHfx = 0.

Its solution with the initial condition (18) is

f (x, t) =

εamˆkm−1 ln (x2 + (a

t)2),

−

−

i.e., within the linear model the perturbation grows without limit and becomes inﬁnite at

the time t = a, which of course violates the applicability conditions for this model.

Will introducing nonlinearity into the model permit a singularity to develop in the so-

lution before the condition

1 breaks down? (The branch-point nature of this

ηx| ≈ |

fx| ≪

|

singularity agrees with the condition that the angles be small.) To answer this question, we

will examine the evolution of the perturbation (18) according to the nonlinear equation (9).

The symmetry of (18) implies that the singularity forms at point x = 0. Then from (13)

and (14) it follows that the time t0 at which the singularity develops can be found by solving

the following equations simultaneously:

0 + it0 + 2Q(x′
x′

0) t0 = 0,

1 + 2Qx′(x′

0) t0 = 0,

where the function Q corresponding to (18) has a pole of order m at the point x′ =

ia:

Since in the linear approximation the singularity is formed at time t = a, the above expres-

sion for t0 implies that the nonlinearity accelerates the formation of the singularity (but if

ε < 0 holds, the nonlinearity delays the onset of the instability).

Plugging the above expression for x′

0 into the expression for Q and its second derivative

Qx′x′, we obtain

q′′

i(m + 1)
2a2

≈ −

(2εm!)−1/(m+1) ,

q0 ≈

i
2m

(2εm!)1/(m+1) .

Thus, for perturbations of the form (18) the parameter q′′ is ﬁnite. This means that the

dynamics of surface perturbations near a singular point is described fairly accurately by Eqs.

(15)–(17). As for the parameter q0, the smallness of ε implies

1. This is an important

q0| ≪

|

result. The important point is that this parameter, as (12) and (15) imply, determines the

characteristic angles of slope of the surface by the moment of singularity formation. Then

for the derivative ηx at the time of collapse the following estimate holds:

ηx| ∼

|

ε1/(m+1)

1,

≪

i.e., the characteristic angles remain small, even through they increased by a factor of
ε−m/(m+1). In this case there is not enough time for the small-angle condition to be vio-

lated as a result of the development of a linear instability, and the proposed model (Eqs.

(8) and (9)) is closed in the sense that if the initial perturbation meets all the conditions

needed for the model to be valid, this property is retained throughout the entire evolution

until the time of collapse, t0.

We now discuss the behavior of a perturbation of the electric ﬁeld at the conducting

near the singularity. Clearly, in the linear approximation the ﬁeld perturbation is speciﬁed

surface,

Substituting v of Eq. (15) in this expression, we ﬁnd that at the singular point

Since the parameter q0 is small, the perturbation of the electric ﬁeld at the time of singularity

formation remain much weaker than the external ﬁeld (both δEx and δEt are singular).

VI. SELF-SIMILAR SOLUTIONS IN THE GENERAL CASE

In Sec. 5 we found that

1 holds in the small-angle approximation. This allows

q0| ≪

|

us to ignore the dependence on this parameter in Eqs. (16) and (17). Then, if q′′

= 0, the

dynamics of the surface curvature in the one-dimensional case is given by the expression

which describes the evolution of the surface curvature in the linear approximation, as follows

that, on the one hand, the dynamics of the surface near a singularity is described by the

the presence of a nonlinearity leads to a situation in which of all the possible self-similar

solutions only those with rational values of p speciﬁed by the condition (22) are realized

(from general considerations it follows that p = 1/2).

It is therefore natural to assume that in the two-dimensional case, as in the one-

dimensional, the solutions in a small neighborhood of the singularity are self-similar:

whose linearity makes it possible to eﬀectively study the formation of two-dimensional sin-

gularities at the surface of a conducting medium. Note that this statement is valid if p < 1,

which, as condition (22) shows, is met in our case in a natural manner. The point is that at

p = 1 an expression of the form (23) corresponds to the symmetries of the initial nonlinear

equation of motion. This mean that near a singularity the contribution of a nonlinearity is

comparable to that of the linear terms, and the analysis of the behavior of the surface lies

outside the scope of this paper.

Substituting (23) in (24), we arrive at the following integro-diﬀerential equation for the

the curvature of the surface in a small neighborhood of the singular point is determined by

the asymptotic solutions of this equation as ξ2 + ζ 2

solutions are described by the partial diﬀerential equation

we arrive at the following formula for the curvature of the surface near the singular point:

VII. CONCLUSION

Our analysis of the evolution of the boundary of a conducting liquid in a strong electric

ﬁeld within the small-angle approximation has shown that for almost any initial conditions

on an initially smooth surface the presence of a nonlinearity gives rise to points at which

the curvature of the surface becomes inﬁnite. These points correspond to branch points

of the root type. However, the presence of such singularities does not ensure a signiﬁcant

concentration of the electric ﬁeld near the surface of the conductor and, hence, cannot

by itself lead to vacuum breakdown.

In this case we may assume that the main role of

these branch points in the general evolution of the system is, in time, to generate stronger

singularities capable of substantially inﬂuencing the emission from liquid metal; in particular,

capable of ensuring the conditions needing for the initiation of explosive electron emission.

Among such singularities are, for instance, discontinuities in the ﬁrst derivative of the surface

proﬁle, which were observed in experiments [5, 7]. Note that a theoretical study of such

singularities lies outside the scope of the small-angle approximation and requires allowing

for surface tension.

Indeed, the applicability of the model adopted in the present paper

is limited to the scales

δx

l, where the parameter l is the characteristics length on

which the capillary eﬀects become important. This parameter, on dimensional grounds, is

determined by the ratio of surface tension to the electric-ﬁeld energy density:

l

α/E2.

The stabilizing eﬀect of the surface pressure means that at time t0 the curvature of the

surface is still ﬁnite (K

1/l) and the proﬁle of the surface is smooth, and the formation

of a singular proﬁle begins in the later stages in the development of an instability.

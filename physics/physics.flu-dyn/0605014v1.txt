Abstract

The circulation around any closed loop is a Lagrangian invariant for classical,
smooth solutions of the incompressible Euler equations in any number of space
dimensions. However, singular solutions relevant to turbulent ﬂows need not pre-
serve the classical integrals of motion. Here we generalize the Kelvin theorem on
conservation of circulations to distributional solutions of Euler and give necessary
conditions for the anomalous dissipation of circulations. We discuss the important
role of Kelvin’s theorem in turbulent vortex-stretching dynamics and conjecture a
version of the theorem which may apply to suitable singular solutions.

Key words: turbulence, circulation, Euler equations, Kelvin theorem

1 Introduction

In a monumental paper, Helmholtz (1858) formulated the fundamental laws
of vortex motion for incompressible ﬂuids. These include the statements, in
three space dimensions, that vortex lines are material lines and that the ﬂux
within any vortex tube is a Lagrangian invariant. Lord Kelvin (1869) gave
an elegant alternative formulation of these laws in terms of the conservation
of circulation, for any closed loop advected by an ideal ﬂuid. This theorem
is equally valid in any space dimension. However, it is only rigorously proved
for suﬃciently smooth solutions. As was pointed out by Onsager (1949), the
classical conservation laws need not be valid for singular solutions of Euler
equations. In particular, breakdown of the energy conservation law can ac-
count for the anomalous dissipation of energy observed in turbulent ﬂuids at

high Reynolds numbers. From a physical point of view, this breakdown of
energy conservation corresponds to the turbulent energy cascade and a ﬂux
of energy to arbitrarily small scales. See also Eyink (1994),Constantin et al.
(1994), Duchon & Robert (2000).

These considerations make it very natural to inquire whether Kelvin’s theorem
will remain valid for singular solutions of the Euler equations. This question
asumes some importance since the conservation of circulations was argued by
Taylor (1938) to play a key role in the enhanced production of dissipation in
turbulent ﬂuids, by the process of vortex line-stretching. Despite its plausibil-
ity, the validity of Taylor’s argument is far from clear. It is not obvious a priori
why there should not be anomalous dissipation of the circulation invariants,
corresponding to a turbulent “ﬂux of circulations” from large to small scales.

In this paper, we examine these questions and establish a few relevant rig-
orous results. In section 2 we brieﬂy review the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz
theorem and its role in turbulence dynamics. In section 3 we prove a theorem
on conservation of circulations for singular solutions of incompressible Euler
equations, analogous to that of Onsager (1949) for conservation of energy. In
section 4 we discuss diﬃculties in formulating the Kelvin theorem for singular
solutions, due to the breakdown in uniqueness of Lagrangian trajectories, and
conjecture a statistical version of circulation-conservation which may apply.

2 The Classical Kelvin Theorem

The velocity ﬁeld u(x, t) solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation

∂tu + (u·∇)u = −∇p + ν △ u, ∇·u = 0

with x ∈ Λ ⊂ Rd, for any integer d ≥ 2, satisﬁes the Kelvin-Helmholtz
theorem in the following sense: For any closed, rectiﬁable loop C ⊂ Λ at an
initial time t0, the circulation Γ(C, t) =

C(t) u(t)·dx satisﬁes

where C(t) is the loop advected by the ﬂuid velocity, at time t. E.g., see
Saﬀman (1992), section §1.6, for the standard derivation. It is worth observing
that the Kelvin theorem for all loops C is formally equivalent to the Navier-
Stokes equation (1). Indeed, if u(x, t) is a smooth spacetime velocity ﬁeld,

2

diverence-free at all times t, then equation (2) implies that

[Dtu(t) − ν △ u(t)] ·dx = 0

I
C

for all loops C at every time t. Here Dtu = ∂tu + (u·∇)u is the Lagrangian
time-derivative and the equation (3) is derived by applying (2) to the pre-
image of the loop C at initial time t0. By Stokes theorem, equation (3) can
hold for all loops C ⊂ Λ if and only if there exists a pressure-ﬁeld p(x, t)
such that the Navier-Stokes equation (1) holds locally and also globally, if the
domain Λ is simply connected.

In the inviscid limit ν → 0, the circulation is formally conserved for any initial
loop C. The ﬂuid equations in this limit, the incompressible Euler equations,
are the equations of motion of a classical Hamiltonian system. They can be
derived by the Hamilton-Maupertuis principle from the action functional

with the pressure ﬁeld p(x, t) a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the incom-
pressibility constraint. Here x(a, t) is the Lagrangian ﬂow map which satisﬁes
˙x(a, t) = u(x(a, t), t) with initial condition x(a, t0) = a. See Salmon (1988)
for a review. This variational principle yields the ﬂuid equations in a La-
grangian formulation, as ¨x(a, t) = −∇p(x(a, t), t). The Eulerian formulation
(1) (with ν = 0) is obtained by performing variations in the inverse map
a(x, t), or “back-to-labels map”, with ﬁxed particle positions x. This Hamil-
tonian system has an inﬁnite-dimensional gauge symmetry group consisting of
all volume-preserving diﬀeomorphisms of Λ, which corresponds to all smooth
choices of initial ﬂuid particle labels. In this framework, the conservation of
the circulations for all closed loops C emerges as a consequence of Noether’s
theorem for the particle-relabelling symmetry. See Salmon (1988), Section 4.

The Kelvin theorem has many profound consequences for the dynamics of
incompressible ﬂuids. We just note here a well-known deduction for three-
dimensional turbulence by G. I. Taylor (1938). It is reasonable to assume that
vortex lines—or, for that matter, any material lines—will tend to elongate un-
der chaotic advection by a turbulent velocity ﬁeld. Incompressibility requires
that the cross-sectional area of a vortex tube formed by such lines will shrink
with time. But, in that case, the Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem implies that the
vorticity magnitude of the tube must grow. Taylor (1938) observed that this
process of vortex line-stretching provides an intrinsic mechanism for ampli-
Λ dx|ω|2, where ω = ∇×u. More

recently, regularizations of the Navier-Stokes equation have been proposed as

model equations for large-scale turbulence by Holm et al. (1998); Foias et al.
(2001), motivated by requiring that a Kelvin circulation theorem be preserved.

3 A Generalized Theorem on Conservation of Circulation

This line of reasoning of Taylor (1938) is quite delicate. It assumes certain
properties (material advection of vortex lines and conservation of circulations)
that can hold strictly only in the ν → 0 limit. However, conclusions are drawn
about the limiting behavior of the energy dissipation rate, which directly in-
volves the kinematic viscosity ν! Furthermore, as noted by Onsager (1949), the
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are not expected to remain smooth in
the inviscid limit. Thus, the righthand side of equation (2) does not necessarily
vanish as ν → 0. Physically, there may be a dissipative anomaly for the con-
servation of circulations. If so, then the validity of Taylor’s vortex-stretching
mechanism for turbulent energy dissipation is open to serious question.

The formulation of turbulent conservation of circulation by a zero-viscosity
limit is physically natural, but not the most convenient either for numerical
tests or for rigorous mathematical analysis 1 . We shall instead consider directly
the singular (or distributional) solutions u ∈ L2([0, T ], Λ) of the incompressible
Euler equations, with ν = 0. Let uℓ = Gℓ ∗ u denote the low-pass ﬁltered
velocity at length-scale ℓ, where Gℓ(r) = ℓ−dG(r/ℓ) is a smooth ﬁlter kernel.
Then uℓ satisﬁes the following equation (in the sense of distributions in time):

∂tuℓ + (uℓ·∇)uℓ = −∇pℓ + fℓ,

(5)

where pℓ is the ﬁltered pressure and where fℓ = −∇·τ ℓ is the subgrid force,
i.e. minus the divergence of the stress-tensor τ ℓ = (u u)ℓ − uℓuℓ. Let us choose
a rectiﬁable closed loop C in space. We deﬁne C ℓ(t) as the loop C advected by
the ﬁltered velocity uℓ. This deﬁnition makes sense, since the ﬁltered velocity
uℓ is Lipschitz in space, and corresponding ﬂow maps exist and are unique
(DiPerna & Lions (1989)). We deﬁne a “large-scale circulation” with initial
Cℓ(t) uℓ(t) · dx. The same calculation
loop C as the line-integral Γℓ(C, t) =
H
that establishes the Kelvin circulation theorem for smooth solutions of Euler

1 For example, the Kelvin theorem in the form of equation (2) is not proved to be
valid for the global solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation (1) constructed by Leray
(1934). The diﬃculty here is that the Leray regularization of (1) does not preserve
the Kelvin theorem, while alternative regularizations which do, such as that of
Foias et al. (2001), in turn modify the energy balance. See Constantin (2003).

(7)

Thus, the line-integral of fℓ on the RHS represents a “ﬂux” to subgrid modes
at length-scales < ℓ of circulation on the loop Cℓ(τ ). This motivates the deﬁ-
nition, for any loop C and ﬁlter length ℓ,

Kℓ(C, t) = −

fℓ(t) · dx

I
C(t)

so that (in generalized sense) (d/dt)Γℓ(C, t) = −Kℓ(C, t).

We now prove the following:

Theorem: Let ζp be the pth-order scaling exponent of the velocity, in the sense
that it is the maximal value such that

C ⊂ Λ

satisﬁes limℓ→0 Kℓ(C) = 0 if ζp > (d − 1) + (p/2) for any p ≥ 2.

The special case of this result for p = ∞ states that the “circulation ﬂux” will
go to zero as ℓ → 0 if the smallest velocity H¨older exponent hmin is > 1/2. This
is an exact analogue of the result of Onsager (1949) for vanishing of energy ﬂux
when hmin > 1/3. One can see that it is even easier for circulation-conservation
to be anomalous than for energy-conservation.

Proof: Our argument is close to that given by Constantin et al. (1994) for the
Onsager theorem. The following identity for the subgrid force is easily veriﬁed:

properly, we should replace σp by σp − ǫ for any small ǫ > 0.) Standard
trace theorems then imply that the restriction of u to the submanifold C

As an application, consider a velocity ﬁeld that is Lipschitz regular, so that
ζp = p for all p ≥ 1. In that case, it suﬃces to take p > 2(d − 1) in order to
show that the circulation is conserved (in the sense that the ﬂux vanishes for
ℓ → 0.) This result applies to the 2D enstrophy cascade, since it is expected
there that ζp = p, with only logarithmic corrections, for all p ≥ 2. See Eyink
(2000). Thus, we expect that the Kelvin theorem holds in a strong sense —
for individual realizations—in the 2D enstrophy cascade. However, in the 3D
energy cascade the conditions of the theorem are not expected to be satisﬁed.

4 The Role of Kelvin’s Theorem for Singular Solutions

Even assuming that the assumptions of our theorem are met, there are addi-
tional diﬃculties in justifying constancy of the circulation invariants. Vanish-
ing of the circulation ﬂux for loops of ﬁnite length, as established in our theo-
rem, is not suﬃcient. In the ﬁrst place, the material loop C ℓ(t) is not expected
to remain rectiﬁable as ℓ → 0, but instead to become a fractal curve C(t) with
Hausdorﬀ dimension > 1 for any positive time t (Sreenivasan & Meneveau
(1986)). Thus, we cannot immediately infer that the RHS of equation (6)
vanishes as ℓ → 0, nor even make sense of the contour integral in that
limit. A possible approach here is to transform the RHS to label-space, as
C fℓ(xℓ(τ ), τ ) · dxℓ(τ ) where the map satisﬁes ˙xℓ(a, τ ) = uℓ(xℓ(a, τ ), τ ). This
H
can make sense as a Stieltjes integral on the loop C in label-space for H¨older
continuous maps (e.g. see Young (1936)),Z¨ahle (1998)).

However, there is a much more serious problem in formulating Kelvin’s the-
orem for singular Euler solutions: it is not clear that material loops exist!
Recent work on an idealized turbulence problem—the Kraichnan model of
random advection—has shown that Lagrangian particle trajectories x(t), x′(t)
can explosively separate even when x0 = x′
0 initially, if the advecting velocity
ﬁeld is only H¨older continuous and not Lipschitz. See Bernard et al. (1998).
Mathematically, this is a consequence of the non-uniqueness of solutions to the
initial-value problem, while, physically, it corresponds to the two-particle tur-
bulent diﬀusion of Richardson (1926). Le Jan & Raimond (2002, 2004) have

rigorously proved that there is a random process of Lagrangian particle paths
x(t) in the Kraichnan model for a ﬁxed realization of the advecting veloc-
ity and a ﬁxed initial particle position. This phenomenon has been termed
spontaneous stochasticity (Chaves et al. (2003)). A similar notion of “gener-
alized ﬂow” was proposed by Brenier (1989) for the problem of minimizing
the action (4). In his formulation, the action is generalized to a functional
tf
S[P ] = 1
t0 dt | ˙x(t)|2, where P is a probability measure on path-

space, and he showed that minimizers always exist in this framework. Unfor-
tunately, this notion does not permit one to deﬁne the concept of material
lines and surfaces for ideal ﬂow. A more natural generalization of the classical
action would be of the form

where P is now a probability measure on time-histories of measure-preserving
maps 3 . For any realization of such a random process and for any initial curve
C the advected object C(t) = x(C, t) is well-deﬁned and remains a (random)
curve for all time t, if the maps are continuous in space.

Let us assume for the moment that the (very nontrivial) problem can be solved
to construct such a generalized ﬂow x(a, t), or stochastic process in the space
of volume-preserving maps, which is hopefully a.s. H¨older continuous in space
so that material loops C(t) exist as random, fractal curves. We would like to

present some plausibility arguments in favor of the conjecture that circulations
shall be conserved in a statistical sense. More precisely, we expect that the
circulations Γ(C, t) for any initial smooth loop C shall be martingales of the
generalized ﬂow:

E [Γ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′] = Γ(C, t′),

for t > t′.

(11)

Here E[·] denotes the expectation over the ensemble of random Lagrangian
paths and we have conditioned on the past circulation history {Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′}.
Heuristically,

(d/dt)E [Γ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′] = − lim
ℓ→0

E [Kℓ(C, t)|Γ(C, τ ), τ < t′] . (12)

Note that the conditioning event involves scales of the order of the radius of
gyration of the loops C(τ ), τ < t′, while the circulation-ﬂux involves velocity-
increments over separation lengths ℓ → 0. Therefore, we expect that Kol-
mogorov’s idea of small-scale homogeneity (and isotropy) will apply. Note,
however, that the homogeneous average of the subgrid force fℓ is zero, because
it is the divergence of the stress tensor. From another point of view, the sub-
grid force will become increasingly irregular for ℓ ≪ R(t) (the radius of the
loop C(t)) and the sign of the integrand fℓ(xℓ(s, t))·x′
ℓ(s, t) will oscillate more
rapidly as a function of the arclength s. Thus, cancellations will occur. For
these reasons, we expect that the limit on the RHS of (12) shall vanish, im-
plying (11). Another formal argument can be given by applying the Noether
theorem to the generalized action (10) and using the fact that a global mini-
mizer must also minimize the action for the time segment [t′, tf ]. On the other
hand, based upon our earlier theorem, it is very unlikely that circulation-ﬂux
will vanish as ℓ → 0 in every realization, without any averaging.

In this section we have clearly indulged in some speculative thinking, but we
hopefully have also succeeded in outlining the various diﬃculties in properly
formulating Kelvin’s theorem for turbulent solutions of the Euler equations.
Our own view is that the Taylor (1938) mechanism of vortex line-stretching is
the underlying cause of enhanced dissipation in three-dimensional turbulence
asymptotically at high Reynolds numbers. However, much work remains to
elucidate the details of the subtle dynamics involved.

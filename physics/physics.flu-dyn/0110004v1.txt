MATRIX FLUID DYNAMICS

The lagrangian representation of ﬂuid motion is alternative with respect to the
conventional eulerian description. It is focused on observing the motion of individual
ﬂuid particles identiﬁed by three parameters known as the lagrangian variables. The
set of ideal-ﬂuid lagrangian governing equations consists of four non-linear differ-
ential equations for current positions of ﬂuid particles as functions of the lagrangian
variables and time [1]. According to Aref ([2], p.274), ‘ . . . analytical tradition has
clearly favoured the eulerian representation, and considered the lagrangian version to
be analytically intractable’. The lagrangian analytical study of a viscous ﬂuid is even
more problematic because of the extreme complexity of the known expression for the
viscous force [3].

This paper aims at showing that we can advance in the analytical study of the
lagrangian ﬂuid dynamics due to a new matrix approach proposed in [4]. The ma-
trix approach is based on the notion of continuous deformation of inﬁnitesimal vec-
tor ﬂuid elements and treats the Jacobi matrix of derivatives of particles coordinates
with respect to the lagrangian variables as the fundamental quantity describing ﬂuid
motion. The matrix (‘deformation’) approach is distinct from the conventional la-
grangian (‘trajectory’) formulation and is, actually, similar to the tensor description
in the elasticity theory. A closed set of governing equations is formulated in terms of
the Jacobi matrix and studied for both ideal and viscous ﬂuid. Recent results on the
3-D extension of plane lagrangian solutions are reported.

Matrix form of ideal-ﬂuid hydrodynamic equations

In the conventional lagrangian approach, ﬂuid motion is described by current
particle position X =
, considered as a function of time t and the la-
X, Y, Z
}
{
grangian variables a =
: X = X(a, t). Let us consider the Jacobi matrix
a, b, c
}
{
R(a, t) = ∂X/∂a as the principal characteristic of ﬂuid motion. The evolution of
an inﬁnitesimal material vector dX corresponding to an increment of the lagrangian
variables da is then given by dX = R da. For an ideal ﬂuid, the Jacobi matrix is
shown to satisfy the following set of equations [4]:

det R = det R0, RT

RTRt = S,

∂Rnm/∂ak = ∂Rnk/∂am,

where R0 = R(a, 0), RT is the transposed Jacobi matrix, subscript ‘t’ denoting
the time derivative, S =
is a time-independent antisymmetric matrix of the

jectories X(a, t) by a solution of (1) for R uniquely through integration over the
lagrangian variables:

X(a, t) =

R

The speciﬁc features of set (1) consist in the following. The continuity equation
takes the form of an algebraic constraint on the Jacobi matrix. The equation of mo-
tion is formulated as a nonlinear matrix differential equation in time only, where the
derivatives with respect to the lagrangian variables do not appear. The accompanying
consistency condition is linear and does not include the time derivatives. Altogether,
set (1) admits a ﬂexible formulation of the problem of interest and allows one to take
advantage of the powerful machinery of matrix calculus.

The expression for vorticity takes the form

Ω = (det R0)

and represents decomposition of vorticity into components along the reference vec-
tors ∂X/∂ai of the frozen-in ‘liquid’ coordinate frame of the lagrangian variables.
Accordingly, the meaning of the invariants Si is that they are proportional to the
contravariant components of vorticity in the ‘lagrangian’ reference frame. As seen
from the formula for its Cartesian components Ωn = det R−1
0 Rni Si, the evolution
of vorticity is described by the Jacobi matrix directly.

Thus, by virtue of the facts that set (1) is closed and one can reconstruct any
required characteristic of the ﬂow by its solution for R it follows that the matrix
approach based on set (1) provides a complete description of motion of an ideal ﬂuid.
A method for constructing solutions to the set of matrix equations which corre-
spond to 3-D rotational ﬂows with precessing vorticity is developed in [4]. It allowed
us to ﬁnd and investigate a new class of 3-D exact matrix solutions that would be ex-
tremely difﬁcult to derive from conventional formulations. The solutions investigated
in [4] depend not only on a set of parameters but on several arbitrary functions of the
Lagrangian variables and incorporate the known 2-D solutions such as the Ptolemaic
vortices [5], the Gerstner waves and Kirchhoff’s vortex as particular cases. Below
we report results of an alternative technique to construct 3-D solutions of the matrix
equations (1).

3-D shearing and stretching of plane motion

X(a, b, t),

The matrix formulation provides a compact ‘block’ representation of 3-D lagran-
gian equations and allows us to study new 3-D extensions of known 2-D rotational
motions. Suppose that
Y (a, b, t) represent a solution of 2-D lagrangian
hydrodynamic equations. The corresponding Jacobi matrix takes the form

The transformation according to (5), (6) allows one to obtain non-trivial exten-
sions of any given 2-D solution. As can be seen from (7), (9), the contributions of
arbitrary functions H(a, b) and f (t) to the resulting 3-D motion are a shear ﬂow
along the Z-direction and stretching of the Z-component of vorticity, respectively.
We shall illustrate the effect of these two factors separately using the 2-D Ptolemaic
vortices [4, 5] as the initial solution. The lagrangian expression for the ﬂow inside
the 2-D Ptolemaic vortex is given in complex variables [5]:

3-D Ptolemaic vortices with swirl
In order to focus on the effect of the Z-shear, we apply transformation (6) to (10)
and eliminate stretching by setting f (t) = 1. The resulting ﬂow is most expediently
described in complex form similar to the initial solution (10):

Here, H(ξ, ξ) remains real-valued. The particle trajectories are regular circular he-
lices. Although the lagrangian expression for the Z-component of the ﬂow is ele-
mentary, the eulerian velocity for (11) cannot be written explicitly and is evidently
non-trivial. The Cartesian components of vorticity are derived from (9), (11):

To have a geometrical idea of the structure of vortex lines, consider their equation in
the space of the lagrangian variables da/S1 = db/S2 = dc/S3. The substitution
of the Cauchy invariants Si from (8) yields da/Hb =
dc/(4ω), then
H = const along the vortex lines. If the contours of H(a, b) = const are closed
inside the vortex (for
< 1), the vortex lines are windings on the cylindrical
surfaces in the space of a, b, c, for which these contours serve as directing curves.
The shapes of vortex lines in Cartesian space are topologically similar, although they
experience periodic distortions, since the smooth mapping deﬁned by (11) is time-
dependent. Figure 1 shows the material (moving with ﬂuid particles) vortex lines of

Such an important solution of 2-D lagrangian equa-
tions as the Gerstner waves [1, 5], can be extended by
analogy with (11):

W = ξ + A exp[i(kξ + σt)], Z = H(ξ, ξ)t + c.

(13)

Noteworthy is the fact that (13) satisﬁes not only the
governing equations but also the boundary conditions
at the free surface Im ξ = 0. The resulting 3-D ﬂows
have helical particle trajectories and generally curvi-
linear vortex lines, their shape depending on the real-
valued function H(ξ, ξ).

Stretched Ptolemaic vortices
Assume that the Z-shear in (5)–(7) vanishes with
H = 0, and consider the effect of the arbitrary function
f (t) proceeding from 2-D Ptolemaic vortices (10). We
shall demonstrate that the extension according to (6)
leads to stretching or contraction of the vortex by a non-
stationary axisymmetric strain ﬂow. The particle trajectories obtained from (10) for

an exterior 3-D potential ﬂow which agrees with the rotational motion across the
boundary of the vortex. We formulate a system of parametric matrix equations for
the exterior potential velocity, provided that parameterization of the coordinates in
the outer region is given. The set of parameters for the outer potential region is most
expediently chosen in accordance with the parameterization of the interior by the
lagrangian variables (14). Using the matrix equations of potentiality we obtain the
potential velocity parametrically at the point of the outer region

Lagrangian equations for a viscous ﬂuid

The notion of the frozen-in lagrangian coordinates and the matrix formulation
are useful not only for an ideal ﬂuid but also for a viscous ﬂuid. We have seen that
the constancy of the Cauchy invariants Si plays an important role for an ideal ﬂuid.
It is natural to question how they change due to viscous force. We shall derive an
equation for Si which serves as the lagrangian analogue of the Helmholtz equation
for a viscous ﬂuid.

The lagrangian equations deduced by a direct
change to the lagrangian variables in the Navier–
Stokes equation are known from the literature [3].
However, their structure is so complicated that no
progress in their analytical study or applications
has been achieved until now.

For an alternative approach, we consider the
column vector S =
composed of
the Cauchy invariants. It is related to the velocity
vector by S = rota(RTX t), where (rotaA)i =
eijk∂Aj/∂ak. The change of S occurs due to the
viscous force exclusively and is governed by the
diffusion-type equation

stitute a closed system of equations that fully describes the motion of a viscous ﬂuid,
provided that Si in (1) are considered as functions of time.

For high viscosity (Re

should nevertheless keep the time derivatives in (1)). More profound study of (17),
(18) and their applications are beyond the scope of this report.

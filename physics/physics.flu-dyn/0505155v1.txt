Abstract

We apply a simple method to provide explicit expressions for diﬀerent scaling expo-
nents in intermittent fully developed turbulence, that before were only given through
a Legendre transform. This includes predictability exponents for inﬁnitesimal and
non inﬁnitesimal perturbations, Lagrangian velocity exponents, and dispersion ex-
ponents. We obtain also new results concerning inverse statistics corresponding to
exit-time moments.

1 Introduction

One of the main feature of homogeneous and isotropic fully developed turbu-
lence, corresponding to very large Reynolds numbers, is the fact that statistical
properties at small scales are scaling and universal [1], and possess intermit-
tent ﬂuctuations [2]. This is classically characterized using structure functions
scaling exponents, describing the probability density of velocity ﬂuctuations
at all scales belonging to the inertial range [3]. This concerns the Eulerian
velocity and its statistics, but the characteristic features of fully developed
turbulence is not only intermittency and multiple scales, it is also the loss of
predictability, chaotic behaviour, dispersion and mixing properties, and a large
number of degrees of freedom. In the last ten years, many of these properties
have been revisited taking into account intermittency to consider how diﬀerent
scaling laws related to these issues are modiﬁed (for a review of several results
in this framework see [4]). The scaling exponents obtained have often been ex-
pressed as a Legendre transform of some function of velocity exponents, and
numerical applications need a numerical Legendre transform involving the di-
mension function of velocity ﬂuctuations. Here we present a simple method to

simplify Legendre transform expressions and to replace them with paramet-
ric functions that provide explicitely the scaling exponents when the Eulerian
velocity scaling exponent structure functions are known. In the following the
general framework is presented in section 2 and applied to diﬀerent applica-
tions from predictability to ǫ-entropy studies in section 3. Let us note that
the results presented here correspond to the ideal situation of homogeneous
and isotropic turbulence; for realistic ﬂows, this property cannot be expected
to hold perfectly since the inﬂuence of boundary conditions may introduce
statistical inhomogeneity.

2 The multifractal framework and Legendre transform

We recall ﬁrst here the multifractal framework for velocity intermittency in
turbulence, classically characterized using statistical moments of velocity in-
crements. We recall the Legendre transform introduced to relate scaling mo-
ment function to the codimension function of velocity singularities. The latter
is subsequently systematically used to simplify the Legendre transform of some
general expression of the codimension function.

2.1 Singularities, moment functions and Legendre transform

In fully developed turbulence, intermittency is classically characterized by
ζ(q), the scaling exponent of spatial structure functions. Denoting ∆Vℓ =
|V (x + ℓ) − V (x)| the increments of the velocity ﬁeld at a spatial scale ℓ, their
ﬂuctuations are characterized, in the inertial range, using the scale invariant
moment function ζ(q) (see [3,5] for reviews):

< ∆V q

ℓ >∼ ℓζ(q)

(1)

where q is the order of moment. Kolmogorov’s initial proposal [1], for a non-
intermittent constant dissipation, leads to ζ(q) = q/3. For intermittent turbu-
lence, ζ(q) is a cumulant generating function, and is nonlinear and concave;
only the third moment has no intermittency correction: ζ(3) = 1 (see below).
On the other hand, taking into account intermittency for the Eulerian velocity,
one can write locally:

∆Vℓ ∼ ℓh
where h is a singularity of the velocity ﬂuctuations. There is a continuous range
of possible h values, and they are characterized through their codimension
function c(h) deﬁned as [3,5]:

(2)

p(∆Vℓ) ∼ ℓc(h)

(3)

2

where p(∆Vℓ) is the probability density of velocity ﬂuctuations at scale ℓ.
Here the codimension is used for convenience, instead of the more classical
dimension f (h) = d − c(h), where d is the dimension of the space (d = 1
or d = 3 in most studies), and p(∆Vℓ) is the probability density of velocity
ﬂuctuations. Let us note that, while h can be both negative or positive (but
it is most of the time positive), the codimension function c(h) is positive and
decreasing. This continuous range of h values justiﬁed the use of the term
“multifractal” for such process [6].

The moments write:

< ∆V q

ℓ > =

∆V q

ℓ p(∆Vℓ)

∼

ℓqh+c(h)p(h) ∼ ℓζE(q)

Z

Z

using a saddle point argument [6], this gives the classical Legendre transform,
between ζE(q) and the codimension function:

This can also be written in the following way, emphasizing the one-to-one
relation between orders of moment q and singularities h:

ζ(q) = min

{qh + c(h)}

h

qh + c(h) = ζ(q)
q = −c′(h)




The last relation can be replaced by h = ζ ′(q). Equations (7) are used below.



2.2 Estimates of structure function scaling exponents up to moments of order

8

The scaling moment function ζ(q) is proportional to the cumulant generating
function of the variable log |∆Vℓ|; it is nonlinear and concave. There are two
“ﬁxed points” for this curve, corresponding to a piori exact values: ζ(0) = 0
and ζ(3) = 1. The latter relation is a consequence of the Kolmogorov 4/5
law [7] for the third order longitudinal structure function (without absolute
values):

< ∆V 3

ℓ >= −

ǫℓ

5

The other moments do not have well-accepted theoretical values; the analytical
curves depend on the stochastic model chosen for the statistics of velocity
ﬂuctuations. In agreement with Kolmogorov’s initial hypothesis concerning
the universality of velocity ﬂuctuations in the inertial range, experimental
estimates are rather stable for small and medium orders of moments and do

(8)

not depend on the Reynolds number: the exponents ζE(q) have been estimated
experimentally for more than twenty years, for diﬀerent types of ﬂows (see
[8,9,10,11,12,13]), and are now considered as rather stable and almost universal
until moments of order 7 or 8 [10,11]. Let us note that the moment of order
7 seems to be close to 2, for any reasons that did not receive up to now any
theoretical founding.

Since these estimates are rather stable up to moments of order 8, we chose in
the following for simplicity for ζE(q) average values of the estimates published
in Ref. [9,11,12,13]: see Table 1. These are estimates obtained from many
experiments with Rλ going from 35 to 5 000. The experimental average which
is used here is quite close to all these experimental estimates.

3 Applications to diﬀerent predictability and dispersion turbu-

lence functions

of turbulence

3.1 Predictability of small perturbations in the intermediate dissipation range

Let us ﬁrst consider the predictability property of small perturbations in tur-
bulence. It is well-known that the viscous cutoﬀ, corresponding to the scale
for which the Reynolds number is of order 1, is diﬀerent from the Kolmogorov
scale η when intermittency is taken into account: more intense singularities
have a smaller local cutoﬀ scale and weak ﬂuctuations have larger cutoﬀ scales.
This range of scales is the intermediate dissipation range, where there is a mix-
ture of inertial and dissipation eﬀects. Using Eq. (2) and the Reynolds number
Re = V L/ν, this writes [14]:

ηh = LRe−1/(1+h)

where L is a large scale and ηh is the cutoﬀ scale associated to singularity
h. This spatial scale is associated to a temporal cutoﬀ scale τh through the
velocity vh = (ηh)h: τh = ηh/vh = (ηh)1−h giving the singularity dependent
cutoﬀ time scale:

τh = T Re

h−1
h+1

where T is the large time scale associated to L. This temporal cutoﬀ scale
is the smallest scale of the system: below these scales viscosity dominates.
In fully developed turbulence, the positive maximum Lyapunov exponent λ,
characterizing the exponential growth rate of an inﬁnitesimal disturbance, is
proportional to the inverse of the smallest characteristic time of the system.
Since there is a range of time scales associated to the continuous range of h

values through Eq.(10), the Lyapunov exponent may be given by [15,16]:

giving ﬁnally:

λ ∼

h+1 dh

λ ∼ Reα

with the exponent α given by a saddle-point argument since the Reynolds
number is large [15,16]:

α = max

h (

1 − h − c(h)
1 + h

)

This was solved numerically by Crisanti et al. [15] to provide α ≃ 0.46 through
a numerical Legendre transform using experimental estimates of the function
c(h). This result is slightly smaller than the one provided by Ruelle [17] for
nonintermittent turbulence: α = 1/2.

Let us go further and show here how to obtain this exponent, considering, for
more generality, the moments of order q > 0 of the inverse times:

<

>∼ Reα(q)

τ q
h

where, using as done above a saddle-point argument, the exponents α(q) are
given by:

α(q) = max

q(1 − h) − c(h)
1 + h

)

h (

In general, the singularity h0 for which this condition is met veriﬁes G′(h0) = 0
where

Estimating the derivative G′(h0) = 0 and using Eq. (7) to introduce the mo-
ment q0 associated to the singularity h0 leads to:

G(h) =

q(1 − h) − c(h)
1 + h

ζ(q0) = 2q − q0

This provides a unique value of q0 and hence of h0, for a given value of q.
This equation, together with another use of the Legendre transform, gives the
function α(q) = G(h0):

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

α(q) = G(h0) =

q(1 − h0) − (ζ(q0) − q0h0)
1 + h0

= q0 − q

5

This gives ﬁnally the following parametric relation between α(q) and the mo-
ment function ζ(q):

ζ(q0) = 2q − q0
α(q) = q0 − q






(18)

The nonintermittent curve obtained for ζ(q) = q/3 is α(q) = q/2. The ex-
plicit parametric relation (18) can be used to represent the curve α(q) for
experimental estimates of ζ(q): this is shown in Fig. 1 using the average ζ(q)
curve. One can see from Fig. 1 that up to moments of order 2.5 the linear
non-intermittent curve is a very good approximation. The value of α(1) = α
is smaller than 1/2 (close to 0.48) but the intermittent correction is very small.
For q = 1 we have α = α(1) = q0 − 1, where q0 is given by ζ(q0) = 2 − q0.
For q = 2 one obtains q0 = 3 since ζ(3) = 1, and hence α(2) = 1 is a ﬁxed
point, non aﬀected by intermittency, recovering a result already given in Ref.
[15]. One can also obtain the following estimates: α(3) ≃ 1.56, α(4) ≃ 2.2,
α(4.5) ≃ 2.5 (coming from ζ(7) ≃ 2), and α(5) ≃ 2.85.

3.2 Predictability of noninﬁnitesimal perturbations in turbulence

The same approach can be used to express scaling exponents characterizing
time scale statistics associated to noninﬁnitesimal perturbations. As proposed
in Ref. [18] and developed in Ref. [4], and using the notations of the lat-
ter reference, we consider a perturbation of size δ of the velocity ﬁeld, for δ
belonging to the inertial range (hence the term noninﬁnitesimal). The time
scale associated to the eddy of typical velocity δ can also be considered as
the decorrelation time associated to the perturbation. In this framework, the
inverse time is 1/τ ∼ δ/ℓ and since using the singularity h, one has ℓ ∼ δ1/h,
we obtain locally the relation between the time scale and the perturbation δ:

As before, this can be used to consider the moments of order q > 0 of the
inverse times, but here we will consider their scaling property as a power-law
function of the velocity perturbation δ. Using the same type of argument as
above, the moments of the inverse time are expressed as an integral over all
singularities h an we consider all functions as power-law functions of δ so that
using a saddle-point argument, one has a scaling law:

where the exponents β(q) are given by the following relation (using the fact
that the probability density writes p(h) ∼ ℓc(h) ∼ δc(h)/h):

−β(q) = max

q(h − 1) + c(h)
h

)

h (

(21)

(22)

where the negative sign has been introduced for convenience to have positive
ﬁnal numerical values for β(q) (see below). As done above for inﬁnitesimal
perturbations, this can be expressed explicitely introducing the singularity
h0 that maximises the expression into brackets. With the same procedure as
above: involving a diﬀerenciation and the introduction of the moment of order
q0 associated to h0, we obtain the ﬁnal result as a parametric relation between
β(q) and ζ(q):

ζ(q0) = q
β(q) = q0 − q = ζ (−1)(q) − q






The exponent β(q) is simply linked to the reciprocal of ζ, denoted ζ (−1). The
nonintermittent curve obtained for ζ(q) = q/3 is β(q) = 2q. Using Eq.(22)
we can see that ζ(3) = 1 gives β(1) = 2, which is a ﬁxed point for β(q),
non aﬀected by intermittency corrections [18]. Figure 2 shows the resulting
function compared to the straight line of equation 2q. It is visible that β(q)
grows very fast. Indeed, the relation ζ(7) ≃ 2 gives the value β(2) ≃ 5. We
can see that for q < 1, β(q) < 2q and for q > 1, β(q) > 2q. The result β(1) = 2
was checked using shell-model simulations [4].

3.3 Lagrangian velocity structure functions’ in turbulence

As an analogy with Kolmogorov’s dimensional analysis in the Eulerian frame-
work, Landau [19] proposed in 1944 a 1/2 law for the temporal increments of
the Lagrangian velocity ∆Vτ = |V (t + τ ) − V (t)|. This was later generalized
by Novikov, with a Lagrangian intermittency framework for the velocity [20]:

< ∆V q

τ >∼ τ ζL(q)

(23)

As for the Eulerian case, for a constant dissipation one obtains the “mean
ﬁeld” expression, neglecting intermittency: ζL(q) = q/2. In this framework,
the third order moment for the Eulerian velocity is analogous to the second
order moment for the Lagrangian velocity: in case of intermittency ζL(q) is
nonlinear and concave, and the non-intermittent function is valid only for
q = 2: ζL(2) = 1.

Recently some authors have proposed an hypothesis helping to relate Eulerian
and Lagrangian structure functions [21,22,23,24], following an earlier proposal
by Borgas [25]. They consider the velocity advecting Lagrangian trajectories

7

as a superposition of diﬀerent velocity contributions coming from diﬀerent
eddies having diﬀerent characteristic times. After a time τ the fastest eddies,
of scale smaller than ℓ, are decorrelated so that at leading order, they assume
[21,22,23]:

∆Vτ ∼ ∆Uℓ
(24)
writing ∆Uℓ ∼ ℓ/τ and using ∆Uℓ ∼ ℓh, gives the time and space local cor-
respondence τ ∼ ℓ1−h. Introducing this relation inside the integral of Eq.(7),
one obtains for the moments of the Eulerian velocity increments:

< ∆U q

ℓ >∼

qh+c(h)

τ

1−h dp(h)

Z
Using a saddle point argument and using Eqs.(24) and (23), this gives the
Lagrangian structure function as a Legendre transform [21]:

ζL(q) = min

qh + c(h)

h  

1 − h !

The authors that explored this relation did not go further to express ζL(q) in
the general case [21,22,23].

In fact, as we showed elsewhere for a Lagrangian turbulence study [26], using
an approach analogous to the ones above, one can obtain an explicit relation
between Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions’ scaling exponents. We
introduce the singularity h0 that maximises the expression into brackets, and
with the same procedure involving a diﬀerenciation and the introduction of
the moment of order q0 associated to h0 we obtain the ﬁnal result (see also
[26]):

ζL(q) = ζE(q0)
q = q0 − ζE(q0)




This relation provides ζL(q) when the fonction ζE(q) is known, the second lign
giving the link between q and q0. We can check that for q0 = 3, the second
line gives q = 2 and the ﬁrst one, ζL(2) = ζE(3) = 1. We can also consider the
case q0 = 7 and using ζE(7) ≃ 2, the approximate result ζL(5) ≃ 1.



Let us note that an analogous expression is provided in [25] for singulari-
ties and (with our notations) codimension functions c(h) in his Appendix A
(Equation (A 4)). Borgas used for this other types of arguments, including
a Reynolds number scaling expression for Eulerian and Lagragian statistics;
however, he did not go to the moment framework to provide an equivalent
expression for structure functions scaling exponents. Let us also note that
some comparisons are performed in [21] between their shell model Lagrangian
values and Eulerian shell model estimates, transformed through a numerical
Legendre transform using the analytical expression of a ﬁt of c(h). The same
type of comparison is performed in [23] between their DNS estimates and a
numerical Legendre transform of Eulerian values. The approach proposed here

(25)

(26)

is more direct since we test an explicit parametric relation corresponding to
diﬀerent hypothesis.

The Euler-Lagrange relation given here is non-linear, so that one cannot ex-
pect to obtain the same type of statistical models in Eulerian and Lagrangian
frameworks. For example, as explained by Chevillard [24] using Borgas’ rela-
tion, in this framework, the statistics cannot be lognormal for both Eulerian
and Lagrangian velocity ﬁelds. Indeed, for ζE(q) = aq − bq2 with a = (2 + µ)/6
(1 − a)2 + 4qb − 2bq)/2b. For
and b = µ/18, one obtains ζL(q) = (a − 1 +
more details see our paper [26] where diﬀerent proposals for the Lagrangian
q
structure functions scaling exponents are tested.

In Figure 3, the Lagrangian prediciton is compared to Lagrangian estimates
published in recent papers [21,27,22]. These papers report diﬀerent types of
such estimates: Ref. [27] gives the values of experimental estimates for four
ﬂows going from Rλ of 510 to 1 000, and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS)
estimates for Rλ=75 and 140. Ref. [21] reports shell model estimates and Ref.
[23] DNS corresponding to Rλ=280. In order not to have a too heavy ﬁgure, we
plotted in Figure 3 four diﬀerent types of Lagrangian values: an average value
of the 4 experiments shown in Ref. [27], the DNS simulation corresponding to
Rλ=140 of the same publication, the shell model estimates of Ref. [21] and
the DNS estimate of Ref. [23]. The average Eulerian curve is transformed and
compared to these four Lagragian estimates. Several comments can be pro-
posed from Figure 3. First, let us note that these experimental and numerical
estimations for Eulerian and Lagrangian scaling exponents come from diﬀerent
types of ﬂows with diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. For Eulerian estimates, the
exponents have been carefully compared and are now considered as rather sta-
bles up to moments of order 8, but for Lagrangian estimates, this work is still
to do; measurements are only available for a few years, and the scaling ranges
are still small, so that the range of variability for these exponents is expected
to narrow in the future. Indeed, as for the Eulerian case, one can expect that
for high Reynolds numbers these exponents are rather stable and universal,
up to a given order of moment that may be smaller than the Eulerian case,
for which this critical order of moments is about 7-8.

With these comments in mind, we can provide some preliminary conclusions
from the observation of Figure 3: (i) up to moment of order 3, the prediction
are close to all Lagrangian data; (ii) for larger moments, there is too much
scatter in the estimates to conclude about the validity of the transformation
given by Eq.(27). A possible explanation of such scatter is the fact that scaling
can be strongly aﬀected by trapping in vortex ﬁlaments [23]. In this case,
after a ﬁltering of high frequencies, the data may be closer to the multifractal
prediction.

3.4 Relative turbulent dispersion

We next consider the inﬂuence of intermittency on relative dispersion: this
deals with the statistics of particle pair dispersion, advected by an intermit-
tent Eulerian velocity ﬁeld. This topic is close to the Lagrangian case. let us
consider R(t), the distance between a pair of particles advected by an inter-
mittent turbulence. Following Ref. [20,28,29], one can introduce ∆Vτ (R), the
velocity diﬀerence along the Lagrangian trajectories. This can be written:

dR
dt

= ∆VR

where ∆VR is the increment of the Lagrangian velocity is evaluated for a
distance R associated to a time scale τ = R/∆VR. Then using the same
hypothesis as for the Lagrangian case (Eqs. (23) and (24)), we obtain the
time evolution of the moments of the pair distance:

< Rq >∼< (τ ∆Vτ )q >∼ τ H(q)

(29)

where H(q) is the scaling exponent characterizing the intermittent pair disper-
sion. Using Eq.(26) the exponents H(q) can be given as a Legendre transform
of the Eulerian velocity, as provided by Boﬀetta et al. [28,29]:

In fact Eq.(29) shows also directly that the dispersion exponent is simply
related to the Lagrangian velocity exponent:

Equations (27) and (31) then give:

H(q) = min

q + c(h)

h  

1 − h !

H(q) = q + ζL(q)

H(q) = q0
q = q0 − ζE(q0)






This can also be written H(q − ζ(q)) = q. This relation could also have been
obtained from Eq.(30) using the same approach as above. With q0 = 3 we
obtain q = 2 and H(2) = 3, corresponding to Richardson’s law < R2 >∼ τ 3
[30], which is thus a ﬁxed point for which there is no intermittency correc-
tion, as already noticed [20,28,29]. In Fig. 4, we represent the transform (32)
compared to the non-intermittent line of equation 3q/2, compared also to the
shell model estimates published in Ref. [29]. This shows that the nonlinearity
of H(q) does not seem very strong. Furthermore, H is concave, and the values
give by Eq. (32) are quite close to the ones reported in Ref. [29].

3.5 Exit-time moments and ǫ-entropy

We ﬁnally consider exit-time moments [31], also called inverse structure func-
tions [32]. We consider a time series of a turbulent quantity X(t) having in-
termittent ﬂuctuations characterized by singularities h such as ∆Xτ ∼ τ h
with codimension c(h): p(h) ∼ τ c(h). The moments are assumed to scale as
τ >∼ τ ζ(q) with Eq.(9). One then studies the dynamics of such signal
< ∆X q
by considering exit times (also called distance structure functions or inverse
turbulence functions): considering a threshold value δ = ∆Xτ , let us denote
τ (δ) the ﬁrst time needed to obtain an increment δ = ∆Xτ . A new time series
(τi) can be obtained this way, whose statistics will scale as the threshold value
δ:

< τ q >∼ δχ(q)
where χ(q) can be obtained, as before, as a Legendre transform involving c(h).
Writing τ ∼ δ1/h and inserting this into the integral of the moment estimation
gives [32,31]:

(33)

χ(q) = min

q + c(h)
h

h  
Here as before, we estimate this function explicitely. A derivative of G(h) =
(q + c(h))/h leads to χ(q) = G(h0) with ζ(q0) = −q. We then obtain

!

The result then writes simply:

χ(q) = −q0
ζ(q0) = −q






χ(−ζ(q0)) = −q0

which is exactly a result given in Ref. [33] based on an exact result for a special
case (a multifractal Cantor set), and experimentally veriﬁed using shell model
turbulence simulations, but with no formal proof of the formulae in the general
case. A similar expression obtained in the very diﬀerent context of Laplacian
random walk is given in Ref. [34].

We must note here, as already noticed in [33], that Eq.(36) involves for either
the original series or for the return time series, negative moments. Let us con-
sider ﬁrst positive moments of return times: q > 0 in Eq.(33). We need here
the hypothesis of the existence of negative moments of the velocity structure
functions, but it may not be the case, since this needs in practice extremely
precise measurements. It is argued in [35] that negative moments for q < −1
do not exist since the pdf of velocity increments does not vanish at 0. The
derivative writes G′(h0) = −(q + ζ(q0))/h2
0. For q > 0, if negative moments
q0 such that ζ(q0) = −q < 0 are not accessible in the experimental time se-
ries, then the derivative stays strictly negative, G(h) does not reach a relative

11

(34)

(35)

(36)

minimum, and the minimal value selected by Eq.(34) will be obtained for the
maximal value of h, which is a “minimal” singularity of the velocity ﬂuctua-
tions, and hence denoted here hmin: χ(q) = G(hmin). Since this value of h is
the same for all q’s, the result is a linear behaviour:

χ(q) =

q + c(hmin)
hmin

(37)

The singularity hmin is associated to small moments and the smallest ﬂuc-
tuations detectable in experimental time series; it is not clear whether this
maximum singularity reaches a ﬁxed value for Eulerian turbulence, and what
is this value. This maximal singularity also depends on the precision of the
experimental measurements which are analyzed. To check this, we consider nu-
merical and experimental analysis of such inverse statistics for q > 0. We plot
in Fig. 5 the data for χ(q) with q > 0 reported in Refs. [32,36]. The latter are
experimental estimates, while the former are obtained from shell model calcu-
lations. Both are rather linear (the published experimental estimates contain
only the ﬁrst three moments), and seem to conﬁrm a linear behaviour such as
Eq.(37). Recently inverse statistics have been tested using wind-tunnel exper-
imental data, conﬁrming a linear behaviour for positive (relative) exponents
[35].

Let us now focus on negative moments of the time statistics: q > 0 in Eq.(33).
This corresponds to positive moments of inverse times. We have ζ(q0) = −q
and χ(q) = G(h0) = −q0. The result will be simply written introducing p = −q
and q0(p) = −χ(q):

with:

The exponent obtained with the inverse statistics is in fact the inverse (in the
sense of reciprocal) of the structure function:

For Eulerian velocity (with Taylor’s hypothesis to interprete time statistics
as being close to spatial statistics), a time series measured at a ﬁxed location
will be characterized by ζ = ζE. Thus q = 1 selects q0 = 3, non aﬀected by
intermittency corrections. The non-intermittent curve is q0 = 3q, and taking
into account intermittency we have also the approximate value q0(2) ≃ 7. The
corresponding curves for Eulerian turbulence and for passive scalar turbulence
(data from Ref. [37] corresponding to an average of several experimental esti-
mates) are shown in Fig. 6: they are increasing fast, especially for the passive
scalar case. Let us note also that the experimental results published in [35] do
not conﬁrm Eq.(40), except for p = 1.

Exit-time statistics have also been used in Ref. [38,39,4] to characterize the
ǫ-entropy of turbulent signals. The concept of ǫ-entropy has been introduced
to quantify the predictability and degree of complexity of continuously vary-
ing signals such as turbulent signals. The continuous signal is transformed
into a symbolic time series using a grid in the phase space, of resolution ǫ.
The classical Shannon entropy h of the resulting symbolic time series is then
studied, as a function of the grid size ǫ (see [40,41]). Abel et al. [38,39] have
proposed to study the ǫ-entropy of turbulent signals h(ǫ) using the exit-times
t(ǫ), the time for the signal to undergo a ﬂuctuation of size ǫ. They obtained
the following expresion

h(ǫ) = hΩ(ǫ) <

>

1
τ

where hΩ(ǫ) is the exit-time ǫ-entropy, being bounded and having only a log-
arithmic variation with ǫ. The leading ǫ behaviour of h(ǫ) is then given by
< 1
τ >, where the average is done here by considering a succession of exit time
events, and is thus related to Eq. (38). This gives using Eq.(38) and ǫ = δ:

h(ǫ) ∼ ǫ−β

β = ζ (−1)(1)

with β = q0(1) as given by Ref. [38,39]. But we can write also using Eq.(40):

Hence for a turbulent time series recorded at a ﬁxed location, but using Tay-
lor’s hypothesis, corresponding to Eulerian turbulence, β = 3 [38,39,4]. On the
other hand, for Eulerian temperature turbulence (still with Taylor’s hypothe-
sis), one will have a larger value since ζθ(3) ≃ 0.8; using the values published
in Ref. [?], we have ζθ(4) ≃ 1 and hence we obtain for passive scalar Eulerian
turbulence βθ ≃ 4. For times series of Lagrangian velocity and passive scalar
turbulence, both characterized by ζ(2) = 1, we have β = 2. This recovers the
result obtained in Ref. [40], which have been obtained using a dimensional ar-
gument, thus corresponding implicitely to Lagrangian velocity. Let us also note
that Eq.(43) recovers the results of Kolmogorov [42]: for Brownian processes
with scaling power spectra of the form E(ω) ∼ ω−(1+2H), he gave β = 1/H.
Equation (43) gives the same result, since for such process, ζ(q) = qH, hence
β = ζ (−1)(1) = 1/H.

Conclusion

We have introduced a simple procedure helping to express explicitely scaling
exponents expressed as Legendre transforms in multifractal turbulence. We
have applied this idea to several problems involving intermittent corrections
to predictability and dispersion studies. Even if the basic idea is simple, this
produced several interesting new results: several functions are obtained as

13

parametric transform of the Eulerian velocity structure function. We have
conﬁrmed and generalized some previously known results and provided some
predictions.

More precisely, in this paper we have expressed the scaling moment function
of inﬁnitesimal perturbations, that characterize the inverse times statistics in
the intermediate dissipation range, as function of the Reynolds number. For
ﬁnite size perturbations, we have also provided the scaling moment function
β(q) of inverse times, as function of the size δ of perturbations, showing that
this exponent is very simply related to the reciprocal of the velocity struc-
ture functions exponent ζ(q). We veryﬁed the known result β(1) = 2 and
obtain the approximate value β(2) ≃ 5. We have also considered Lagrangian
velocity structure functions ζL(q) and showed how to relate them explicitely
to the Eulerian curve ζE(q). We compared the predicted Lagrangian curve
to recent experimental values. We noticed the approximate value ζL(5) ≃ 1.
We also considered the scaling exponent H(q) for pair dispersion which is
very simply related to the Lagrangian scaling exponents. The obtained curve
was compared to recent numerical estimates. We ﬁnally considered exit-time
moments, and conﬁrmed in the general case a result obtained recently on ex-
perimental grounds and analytically for a special case. We showed that, for
exit-time positive moments, the scale invariant function χ(q) may often be
linear, due to ﬁnite precision of experimental measurements. This is in agree-
ment with several published experimental results. We then proposed to focus
on inverse statistics considering negative moments, hence positive moments of
inverse times. In this framework we showed that the resulting exponent q0(q)
is the reciprocal of ζ(q). Using some recent results linking exist time statis-
tics to ǫ-entropy expression, we obtain a new general result for the ǫ-entropy
exponent of multi-aﬃne signals β = ζ (−1)(1) conﬁrming β = 3 for Eulerian
turbulence, and giving as prediction β = 2 for Lagrangian turbulence (velocity
and passive scalar), β ≃ 2 for ﬁnancial time series, and the approximate value
β ≃ 4 for passive scalar Eulerian turbulence.

Fig. 1. The curve α(q) (open dots: experimental values; continuous line: lognormal
ﬁt) compared to the non-intermittent curve of equation q/2 (dotted line). It is visible
that α(1) = α < 1/2, but the intermittency correction is very small. The value
α(2) = 1 is a ﬁxed point not aﬀected by intermittency. One obtains numerically
α(3) ≃ 1.56 and α(4) ≃ 2.2.

Fig. 2. The curve β(q) (open dots: experimental values; continuous line: lognormal
ﬁt) compared to the non-intermittent curve of equation 2q (dotted line). This curve
is strongly nonlinear and increasing very fast. The value β(1) = 2 is a ﬁxed point
and we may note also that β(2) ≃ 5.

Fig. 3. The curve ζL(q) (open dots: experimental values; continuous line: lognormal
ﬁt) compared to the non-intermittent curve of equation q/2 (dotted line), and to
four Lagrangian recent estimates: average of 4 experiments published in [27]; DNS
from [27], with Rλ=140; shell model results from [21]; and DNS from [23]. The
agreement is good for low orders of moment; for larger moments experimental and
numerical estimates of scaling exponents have a larger scatter, and it is diﬃcult to
conclude concerning the validity of Eq. (27).

Fig. 4. The curve H(q) (open dots: experimental values; continuous line: lognormal
ﬁt) compared to the non-intermittent curve of equation 3q/2 (dotted line). This
is also compared to the shell-model estimates published in [29]. The agreement is
quite good. The curve H is only slightly nonlinear and concave.

Fig. 5. Representation of data for χ(q) for q > 0 reported in Refs. [32,36]. These
correspond to numerical estimates from a shell model [32] and experimental esti-
mates with Rλ = 582 for velocity (longitudinal structure functions) and temperature
turbulence [36]. These values are compatible with a linear behaviour (linear ﬁts are
displayed as dotted lines), as predicted by Eq.(37), although experimental estimates
are provided here for only three values.

Fig. 6. The curve q0(p) = ζ (−1)(p) representing the scaling exponent function for
the moments of order p > 0 of the inverse exit times, for the velocity (open dots: ex-
perimental values; continuous line: lognormal ﬁt) compared to the non-intermittent
curve of equation 3q (dotted line); also shown: the same curve for passive scalar tur-
bulence (continuous line and closed dots, data from Ref. [37]). The passive scalar
curve is very close to the velocity one for weak moments; it increases very quickly.
We also represent the ǫ-entropy exponent β = ζ (−1)(1), to emphasize the clear
diﬀerent values for velocity and passive scalar Eulerian turbulence

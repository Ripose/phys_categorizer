The instability of a streak and its nonlinear evolution are investigated by direct numerical simula-
tion (DNS) for plane Poiseuille ﬂow at Re = 3000. It is suggested that there exists a traveling-wave
solution (TWS). The TWS is localized around one of the two walls and notably resemble to the
coherent structures observed in experiments and DNS so far. The phase space structure around
this TWS is similar to a saddle point. Since the stable manifold of this TWS is extended close to
the quasi two dimensional (Q2D) energy axis, the approaching process toward the TWS along the
stable manifold is approximately described as the instability of the streak (Q2D ﬂow) and the suc-
ceeding nonlinear evolution. Bursting corresponds to the escape from the TWS along the unstable
manifold. These manifolds constitute part of basin boundary of the turbulent state.

In wall-turbulent shear ﬂows, turbulence production is
believed to occur or at least to be triggered in the near-
wall region in a deterministic and intermittent way, and
also to be related to coherent structures: bursting [1].
Although the mechanism of the bursting has not been
well understood, the coherence of this process suggests
that a low-dimensional dynamics is embedded even in
fully-developed turbulence [2]. This low-dimensionality
observed in subcritical ﬂows [3] is quite diﬀerent from
weakly nonlinear stage of supercritical ﬂows such as
B´enard convection [4], because the fully-developed tur-
bulence coexists. That is, the low-dimensional dynamics
should be connected to the huge-dimensional dynamics
globally.

This global structure seems to be hopelessly compli-
cated. However, a minimal ﬂow unit for maintaining
turbulence was found by Jin´emez and Moin [5] in plane
Poiseuille ﬂow. Owing to this work we can focus on the
elementary process of turbulence in the near-wall region
from the perspective of dynamical systems without being
bothered by spatial coexistence of various stages. Hamil-
ton et al. [6] examined the minimal ﬂow unit of plane
Couette ﬂow and found that turbulence is sustained by
not random but quasi-cyclic process passing quiescent
and activated periods in turn. The quiescent period is rel-
atively laminar where coherent structures, the so-called
streaks, are formed, develop and become unstable. Then
their instability triggers an activated or turbulent period.
They called this process self-sustaining process (SSP).
Note that the Reynolds numbers (Re) used in their work
are quite low, so they observed spatial chaos rather than
fully-developed turbulence.

This picture seems to work well even in realistic situ-
ations. There are, however, still open questions. One is
on the nonlinear evolution after the instability of streaks
and another is why the unstable streaks are regenerated.
The low-dimensional model introduced heuristically by

Waleﬀe [7] has partially answered to these. The keys are
the existences of steady solutions and a homoclinic orbit.
This model, however, is wholly low-dimensional and not
related to fully-developed turbulence.

Recently, Waleﬀe obtained traveling-wave solutions
(TWS) in plan Poiseuille ﬂow by continuing from steady
solutions in plane Couette ﬂow for stress boundary con-
ditions [8]. These solutions are quite similar in shape to
the coherent structures educed by Joeng et al. [9] in di-
rect numerical simulation (DNS), although the boundary
conditions are diﬀerent.

DNS and experiments have revealed the existence of
coherent structures in the near-wall region that are inti-
mately linked to the maintenance of turbulence. In fact
the sinuous evolution of a streak observed in DNS ap-
pears to trigger oﬀ the formation of longitudinal coher-
ent structures and the succeeding bursting. This process
is also the main part of the SSP picture. Schoppa and
Hussain [10] showed that the instability of ejected low
speed streaks directly generates new streamwise vortices,
internal shear layers and arch vortices by examining sta-
bility of a vortex-less streak [11]. The resulting 3D vor-
tex geometry is identical to that of the dominant coher-
ent structures educed from the near-wall turbulence, too.
They concluded that vortex-less streaks are the main
breeding ground for new streamwise vortices, commonly
accepted as dominant in turbulence production.

In this paper, we try to elucidate the relation of the
conceptual ingredients of the SSP picture such as the
instability of streaks and coherent structures with TWS,
homoclinic nature, etc.
in a more realistic situation by
means of DNS.

The numerical scheme adopted here is basically the
same as those of Kim et al. [12]. For all simulations re-
ported, we use periodic boundary conditions in x and z
with period lengths Lx = π ∼ 420+ and Lz = 0.4π ∼
170+, and apply no-slip boundary conditions at y = ±1:

x, y and z represent the streamwise, normal to the
walls and spanwise directions, respectively. The value
of Reynolds number is ﬁxed to 3000. Though somewhat
large, this system belongs to the minimal ﬂow unit [5].
The ﬂow is maintained by a constant volume ﬂux. As
aliasing errors are removed by 1/2 phase-shift method,
the eﬀective modes are 30 × 30 Fourier modes in x and
z, and 65 Chebychev polynomials in y.

In Fig. 1, the evolution of Reynolds stress integrated
over the horizontal plane, |huxuyi(y, t)| is shown. Tur-
bulent ﬂuctuations are produced close to the walls and
ejected into the center region. These sudden production
and ejection of ﬂuctuations are typical bursting processes
[13]. Bursting on both walls seems to occur indepen-
dently. In the lower half region, an especially quiescent
period where the ﬂow is laminarized and a prominent
streak develops, lasts about ten times as long as ordi-
nary one. Even in this period, bursting continues to oc-
cur in the upper region. This quasi-cyclic and intermit-
tent occurrence of bursting is reminiscent of the chaotic
homoclinic orbit [14].

To describe the low-dimensional dynamics suggested,
we introduce the 2D phase space spanned by the quasi-
2D (Q2D) and 3D components of kinetic energy of the
)2dV /2 and
normal velocity, uy, that is, EQ2D
y )2dV /2, where V denotes the whole vol-
E3D
ume of the computation. Here we decompose the veloc-
ity ﬁeld into two parts: Q2D ﬂow uQ2D(y, z, t), and 3D
ﬂow u3D(x, y, z, t). The latter is constructed by Fourier
modes only with non-zero streamwise wave number. The
velocity ﬁeld restricted in Q2D space, is damped to the
laminar plane Poiseuille ﬂow monotonically for all Re
[15]. In this sense, there is no ﬁxed point on the Q2D
axis except for the origin.

Hamilton et al. [6] deﬁned the streak and the longitudi-
nal vortex as the x component(uQ2D
) of Q2D ﬂow and its
y, z components (uQ2D
), respectively for the mini-
mal Couette turbulence. They also regarded 3D ﬂow as
turbulent components. The simplicity of these deﬁnitions
is a little bit curious because coherent structures are ob-
served in the near-wall region and also three-dimensional.
These deﬁnitions, however, conceptually work well. This
suggests that quiescent stages or generating processes of
coherent structures are well described in a low dimen-
sional phase space.

To see the global behavior of the system in phase space,
we examine the nonlinear evolutions of small 3D distur-
bances superposed to an artiﬁcially obtained Q2D veloc-
ity ﬁeld that seems to be a prototype of a well-developed
streak, as done by Schoppa and Hussain [10]. They used
an analytic streak solution without longitudinal vortex
[11]. In contrast, our streak solution is constructed by
removing the x-dependent modes, i.e.
the 3D compo-
nent, from the streak-dominated velocity ﬁeld obtained
in DNS at t = 337 in Fig. 1 in order to compare the
obtained results with the real situation.
The initial condition is as follows:

u(x, 0) = uQ2D(y, z, 0) + pFac

u3D(x, 0),

||uQ2D
(0)||
y
||u3D
y (0)||

(0.1)

where ||f || ≡ (RV f 2dV )1/2 and u3D(x, 0) is a solenoidal
random vector ﬁeld with a given broad spectrum and
random phase. The following results are qualitatively
independent of the form of u3D(x, 0).

In Fig. 2, the evolutions of EQ2D

We examine the dependence of the evolutions on the
the relative amplitude, Fac of the 3D, i.e., x-dependent
(t) and
disturbance.
E3D
y (t) for several values of Fac are shown. After initial
transient stage where the most growing mode is selected,
3D disturbance (E3D
y (t)) seems to grow exponentially
and then saturate to an equilibrium state in damped-
oscillating. Finally the disturbance chooses either the
route to laminar plane Poiseuille ﬂow or that to turbulent
state depending on whether the value of Fac is smaller
or larger than the critical value. We refer to this crit-
ac = 9.116010224 × 10−8,
ical value, which is close to F I
as F c
ac. The passing time till the ﬁnal abrupt damping
or growth gets longer as Fac approaches F c
ac. The ex-
ponential growth in the initial stage corresponds to the
instability of the streak, while the streak (EQ2D
(t)) con-
tinues to be damped.

y

Figure 3 shows the evolutions in the phase space
spanned by EQ2D
for several values of Fac. It
is easy to see that a ﬁxed point like a saddle-focus exists.
The trajectory is oscillating but approaches monotoni-
cally the expected ﬁxed point.

and E3D

The diﬀerence between two solutions for diﬀerent Fac
increases exponentially with the roughly constant growth
rate, σ+ = 0.037 even in the approaching period. This
suggests that the evolution of E3D
is described as a mo-
tion around a saddle point like (dX/dt, d(Zr + iZi)/dt) =
(σ+X, (−σ− + iω)(Zr + iZi))) ,where i is imaginary unit
and σ+, σ− are positive constants.

y

The complex damping rate could be also estimated,
but the existence of another monotonically-damping
mode makes an estimate diﬃcult (see Fig. 2). A rough
estimate shows that the ratio of these two damping rates
is about 2: the damping rates are -0.004 for the real mode
and -0.008 for the complex one. Therefore the dimension
of the contracted space around the ﬁxed point is at least
larger than 4. This dynamics is more complicated than
Waleﬀe’s model.

Both the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle
point constitute a separatrix that separates turbulent and
laminar states. The stable manifold is extended close to
the Q2D axis. Because of this closeness, the stability of
streaks, i.e., of a Q2D solution, is well recognized even in
fully-developed wall turbulence like in SSP.

We infer that for F c

ac the trajectory reaches the ﬁxed
point. In physical space, the solution corresponding to
this point has a 3D shape and moves steadily with the
velocity v = 0.75±0.05 in the streamwise direction. Thus
the ﬁxed point must be TWS. In this sense, this solution

In the context of control of turbulence generation, the
existence of separatrix supports the laminarization of tur-
bulent ﬂow by forcing the ﬂow to be two-dimensional at
least in the near-wall region e.g. by means of riblets or
suction [13,16].

is not a ﬁxed-point but a periodic orbit. Since we cannot
yield the TWS by DNS in a strict sense anyway, we regard
the saturated state obtained for F I
ac as TWS hereafter.
This TWS is notably resemble in shape to those ob-
tained by Waleﬀe for stress boundary conditions as can
be seen in Fig. 4, although our Re is about ten times as
large as Waleﬀe’s. The streamwise wave length of Wal-
eﬀe’s solution is almost the same as ours and the spanwise
periodicity is 1.67 times as long as ours. Note that while
Waleﬀe’s are symmetric with respect to the centerline of
the channel, our TWS is conﬁned to the lower wall (see
Fig. 5). Our TWS is also so tall in height that it reaches
to the upper boundary of the log-law region and is not
localized to the near-wall region. Furthermore, in wall
turbulence an interval between adjacent streaks is about
100 in wall unit on average. If TWS is linked to the co-
herent structures, there could exist TWSs with shorter
height and/or spanwise periodicity than that of the TWS
found by us. (See Fig. 6(c). Two ejections are observed
on the upper wall.) This suggests that other TWSs con-
ﬁned to the near-wall region exist and these TWSs should
be common in realistic turbulence.

To compare the quiescent period of the turbulence and
the low dimensional dynamics around the TWS, we also
project the evolution of the turbulence onto the 2D phase
space as shown in Fig.3. Here we only use the energies
contained in the lower half volume because the other tur-
bulent evolution occurs independently in the upper half
It is quite surprising that the
volume (see Fig. 6(c)).
projected trajectory is close to the unstable manifold,
because wall turbulence is usually coherent or in order
only in the near-wall region. In the bursting period the
system goes away from the TWS along the unstable man-
ifold. This suggests that the instability not of a streak
but of a TWS is the origin of the bursting process. In
Fig. 6 we show the solutions on the unstable manifold
and the trajectory of turbulence marked in Fig. 3. From
these ﬁgures, the resemblance is apparent.

The most unstable mode of the streak has the same
wavelength as the TWS itself for Lx = π. This seems to
imply that the instability of streaks directly breed coher-
ent structures, i.e., TWS. This is, however, not always
true.
Indeed, when Lx is doubled, the most unstable
mode to the streak is saturated to another TWS with
double the periodicity: the streamwise wave numbers of
the most unstable modes for Lx = π and 2π are the same.
Moreover, we believe that bursting is the escaping pro-
cess from TWS along the unstable manifold. Thus the
stability of TWS is more important than that of streak.
The further study of the former instability should elu-
cidate bursting, i.e., turbulence generation and also the
determination of streak intervals in wall turbulence.

As mentioned above, there may exist many TWSs.
These TWSs may be connected with each others through
turbulent or activated periods, although we have not un-
derstood how they are. This generalized homoclinic or
“multi-clinic” nature of wall turbulence seems to be the
substance of coherent structures and quasi-cyclic evolu-

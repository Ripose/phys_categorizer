Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations (FDR) for a Maxwell ﬂuid are computed via the GENERIC
formalism. This formalism is determined by four building blocks, two “potentials” (total energy and
entropy) and two “matrices” which determine the dynamics, but the understanding of ﬂuctuations in
a given non-equilibrium system is reduced to determining a single friction matrix. The FDR exhibits
interesting features, arising from the type of entropy used in the formalism. We show explicitly this
dependence FDR-Entropy, also we show that GENERIC renders results consistent with irreversible
linear thermodynamics (TIL) only if it is used the corresponding entropy. An inconsistent result is
provided by GENERIC when it is used a modiﬁed entropy .

INTRODUCTION

Much eﬀort has been expended within the theory of
stochastic processes to obtain the mesoscopic basis of
macroscopic theories. The problem of the description
in
of equilibrium and non-equilibrium ﬂuctuations
macroscopic systems is one of the central aspects of both
thermodynamic and microscopic theories of irreversible
processes [1]. From the macroscopic viewpoint, the
non-equilibrium case has been investigated within the
framework of several theories among which we men-
tion in particular extended irreversible thermodynamic
theory (EIT) [2]. The starting point of extended thermo-
dynamics is the generalization of the Gibbs relation for
the non-equilibrium entropy, which is used to determine
the second moments of the physical ﬁelds under the
assumption that the probability of the ﬂuctuations is
given by the Einstein relation [3]. Another, general
formalism for studying the dynamics of non-equilibrium
systems is called GENERIC (general equation for the
non-equilibrium reversible irreversible coupling) [4]. This
framework has been developed to formulate dynamic
equations for out-of-equilibrium systems, by empirical
arguments and by identifying the common structure
of successful models in non-equilibrium thermodynam-
ics and it has been validated by projection operator
techniques [5]. In particular, Generic has proved to be
a strong framework for dealing with the modeling of
rheological properties of complex ﬂuids [7].
Recently, in an attempt to test the consistency between
alternative theories of irreversible processes, the equi-
librium Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum for a Maxwell ﬂuid
has been computed. This was made by using ﬂuctuating
hydrodynamics,
via ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations
(FDR), and by the procedure used by Mountain [8]

∗Electronic address: vazquez@servm.fc.uaem.mx
†Electronic address: olivares@servm.fc.uaem.mx

which is a direct calculation technique. One would a
priori have expected that since the Maxwell model has
been often quoted as the prototype system for an EIT
treatment, the equivalence of the two routes would have
occurred when performing both types of calculations.
However, a discrepancy arose whose origin could be
traced to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for the
(stochastic) stress tensor.
If the prescription made by
Landau for the frequency-dependent dissipative coeﬃ-
cients case is used both routes coincide. In contrast, if
the FDR from EIT is used the two routes diverge.
In this work, we undertake again the testing of consis-
tency between alternative thermodynamic theories. We
describe ﬂuctuations in a viscoelastic ﬂuid by using three
linear
diﬀerent thermodynamic frameworks, namely,
irreversible thermodynamics (LIT), and two versions of
extended irreversible thermodynamics. The ﬁrst one is
extended with the stress tensor, and the second one with
the conformation tensor of the kinetic theory of poly-
meric ﬂuids [4]. Our purpose in this paper is to discuss
explicitly, via GENERIC, why the LIT framework must
to be used for calculating a FDR in rheological models
for complex ﬂuids instead of the extended versions of
irreversible thermodynamics. An unavoidable conclusion
is arising from this analysis. The extended versions of
ﬂuctuating irreversible thermodynamics must be revised.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted
to describe the main characteristics of GENERIC to
make this article self-contained.
In Section III we
illustrate how the FDR are obtained for a known case,
namely, a Newtonian ﬂuid which is described by LIT.
We analyze in Section IV the case of a viscoelastic ﬂuid
within LIT and EIT by extending the thermodynamic
variable space with the dissipative ﬂuxes and with the
conformation tensor [4]. We obtain the corresponding
FDR for each case. Finally,
in Section V we make
some discussion on the previous issues and add some
conclusions.

II. FLUCTUATION-DISSIPATION RELATIONS
AND GENERIC

The

fundamental

time-evolution

of
GENERIC, which was developed by considering
the compatibility of two levels of description and by
studying a large number of speciﬁc examples [4], can be
written in the form

equation

dx
dt

= L(x)

+ M (x)

δE(x)
δx

δS(x)
δx

,

(1)

where x represents the set of independent state variables
required for a complete description of the underlying non-
equilibrium system, the real-valued functionals E and S
are the total energy and entropy expressed in terms of
the state variables x, and L and M are the Poisson and
friction matrices (or linear operators). The two contribu-
tions to the time-evolution of x generated by the energy
E and the entropy S in Eq. 1 are called the reversible
and irreversible contributions to GENERIC, respectively.
Since x typically contains position-dependent ﬁelds, such
as mass, momentum and energy densities, the state vari-
ables are usually labeled by continuous labels in addition
to discrete ones. A matrix multiplication, or the appli-
cation of a linear operator, hence implies not only sum-
mations over discrete labels but also integrations over
continuous labels, and δ/δx typically implies functional
rather than only partial derivatives.
In the GENERIC framework, Eq. (1) is supplemented
by the complementary degeneracy requirements

L(x)

= 0,

δS(x)
δx

(3)

= 0.

M (x)

δE(x)
δx
The requirement (2) expresses the reversible nature of the
L-contribution to the dynamics: the functional form of
the entropy is such that it cannot be aﬀected by the op-
erator generating the reversible dynamics. The require-
ment (3) expresses the conservation of the total energy
by the M -contribution to the dynamics. Furthermore, it
is required that the matrix L is antisymmetric, whereas
M is Onsager-Casimir symmetric and semi-positive def-
inite. Both the complementary degeneracy requirements
(2), (3) and the symmetry properties are extremely im-
portant for formulating proper L and M -matrices when
modeling concrete non-equilibrium problems [5]. Finally,

expresses the time-structure invariance of the reversible

is postulated as another important general
property required by non-equilibrium thermodynamics
[4, 9].
The stochastic dynamics into GENERIC is determined
by the stochastic diﬀerential equation obtained by adding
noise (and the divergence of M ) to Eq. (1) [10],

We now show how the FDR may be obtained in this

since if we integrate on t, t′′ we recover Eq.
(16) and
the integration has arbitrary limits. Expression (17) is
another way to write the FDR. We will use this expres-
sion in the following Sections. As it has been mentioned
the form of matrix M depends on the form of the en-
tropy out from equilibrium. Therefore it determines the
speciﬁc form adopted by expression (17).

III. THE VISCOUS FLUID IN LIT

As an illustration of the stochastic dynamics (7) and
(8), we consider an example of ﬂuctuating hydrodynam-
ics. The results of the previous Section are illustrated
with the case of a viscous Newtonian ﬂuid within LIT. As
usual the physical conserved densities are chosen as inde-
pendent variables to describe the thermodynamic state of
the ﬂuid. Mass density is denoted by ρ, momentum den-
sity by u, and internal energy density by ε. The balance
equations of mass, momentum and energy are written as

Knowing the temperature T = T (ρ, ε) and pressure
p = (ρ, ε), Eqs. (18-22) form a closed set of time evo-
lution equations. The irreversible contributions to the
dynamics are those involving the stress tensor ←→τ and the
heat ﬂux q appearing in Eqs. (19) y (20); the remain-
ing terms are the reversible contributions to the dynam-
ics. The dissipative coeﬃcients may depend on position.
Though the matrix of the reversible part of the dynamics
is not necessary for the study of ﬂuctuations we include
a brief summary to give the complete GENERIC’s equa-
tion. The total energy needs to be expressed as a function
of the set of variables of the system. This set is denoted
by the vector x = (ρ, u, ε). The vector δE/δx results in a
vector with ﬁve entries constituted by functional deriva-
tives of the energy with respect to x. The total energy
is obtained by integrating the addition of the kinetic en-
ergy and internal energy densities over the volume of the
system

The matrix L may be constructed in two ways. Both

on variational techniques. To determine the dissipation

IV. THE MAXWELL FLUID

In this Section we deal with a viscoelastic ﬂuid and
study the ﬂuctuating properties of this kind of ﬂuids.
One way to study viscoelastic ﬂuids from a thermody-
namic point of view is by assuming that viscosity and
elasticity can be considered separately and that the net
eﬀect is additive. Under this assumption one arrives to
one of the simplest models for viscoelasticity, namely, the
Maxwell model. A complete derivation of the Maxwell
model in the macroscopic level may be seen for example
in [13]. One then may tackle the problem of the ﬂuctu-
ations by inserting the Maxwell model in diﬀerent ther-
modynamic frameworks. We concentrate here on three of
them. On the one hand, LIT in which the state variables
of the system are the usual conserved densities of mass,
momentum and energy. In this formalism the entropy is
considered a function of the conserved densities solely as
mentioned in the previous section. On the other hand, we
consider extended theories. Diﬀerent ways of extending
the state variables space in order to deal with viscoelas-
tic ﬂuids exist giving rise to diﬀerent levels of descrip-
tion. A macroscopic level of extended thermodynamics
is obtained when one extends the variable space with the

5

dissipative ﬂuxes of the system, the heat ﬂux and the
stress tensor in this case. We get one more microscopic
level when the same space is extended with structural
variables giving an explicit treatment to some internal
degrees freedom of the constituents of the ﬂuid. In this
level of description one must assure that the dynamic
equations of the more microscopic state variables repro-
duce the Maxwell equation for the stress tensor. In both
of these extended versions of irreversible thermodynam-
ics the entropy is considered a functional of the enlarged
variables space and this introduces a rather controver-
sial issue in the problem. Thus the system under study
is a viscoelastic ﬂuid modelled as a Maxwell ﬂuid when
the relaxation times of the fast properties of the system
(dissipative ﬂuxes, structural variables) are of the order
of the observation time. One would expect that diﬀerent
thermodynamic frameworks lead to the same physical de-
scription of the system. Surprisingly, the results diverge.
We discuss, in some detail (the ﬁnal comments in Section
V), how to discern the validity of these diverse results by
considering the light dispersion properties of the ﬂuid as
obtained from the diﬀerent thermodynamic frameworks
investigated.
We ﬁrst examine the LIT case. This problem must be
treated in Fourier space so we ﬁrstly write the GENERIC
equation in that space. Consider then the next notation
for the time Fourier transform

We note that the two last entries of the vector δE/δx
vanish since the total energy does not depend on the
traceless stress tensor and its trace. Therefore, the aug-
mented matrix M , Eq. (53), trivially satisﬁes the degen-
eracy condition on the gradient of the energy. Eq. (17)
does not lead to the right result for the FDR. See for
example [14], where stochastic process theory was used
to obtain the FDR for the stress tensor of a viscoelastic
ﬂuid modelled as a Maxwell ﬂuid. One may also prove
that the quadratic form of the entropy, Eq. (50) does not
satisfy the degeneracy condition, Eq. (2) with L given in
[4] for the viscous ﬂuid, making this description thermo-
dynamically non-consistent.
We now describe the viscoelastic ﬂuid within the ex-
tended version given in the original GENERIC’s papers
[4]. The variable space is enlarged with the conformation
tensor c given by

c(r) =

QQψ(r, Q)d3Q

(54)

1
ηp Z

where ψ(r, Q) is the conﬁgurational distribution func-
tion, Q is interpreted as a dumbbell conﬁguration vector,
and ηp is the polymer concentration considered here as

constant [4]. By considering that the complex character
of the viscoelastic ﬂuid has only entropic consequences
the total energy of the ﬂuid is written as follows

E =

In this way the form of matrix M , together with the
matrix L (which is very similar to Eq. (54) of [4]) repro-
duces the Maxwell equation for the time evolution of the
osmotic pressure tensor

where D/Dt is the material derivative. However this
form of M is not suitable to be applied to obtain the

where we have changed c

However we make the reader note the fact that this last
form of M leads to a FDR which is in discrepancy with
that expected for the osmotic component of the stress
tensor in the case of a viscoelastic ﬂuid [8],[14]. Never-
theless it must be mentioned that the obtained FDR is of
the δ-correlated type. This fact will be used in our ﬁnal
discussion.

V. DISCUSSION

GENERIC [4] is a formalism which describes the dy-
namics of complex ﬂuids in terms of two generators, the
total energy and the entropy of the system. The thermo-
dynamic consistency of the time evolution equations of
the variable space of the system is assured through the
degeneracy conditions, Eqs.(2) and (3), on the matri-
ces containing the conservative and dissipative dynamics
of the system. We remind the reader that the physical

meaning of the two mentioned conditions is the second
and ﬁrst laws of thermodynamics respectively. The ther-
modynamic consistency of any constitutive model is then
assured if the two conditions are satisﬁed by the con-
stituents of the GENERIC form of the dynamics equa-
tions of the system. We also remark the key role played
by entropy in determining the explicit expressions for the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations in the ﬂuctuating hydro-
dynamics obtained from the GENERIC formulation of
the dynamics.
We have used the ﬂuctuating formulation of GENERIC
to ﬁnd the FDR for a Maxwell ﬂuid in each one of the
three thermodynamic frameworks considered. On the
one hand in Section IV we have already given the rea-
sons why the EIT version with the variable space en-
larged with the dissipative ﬂuxes does not lead to valid
results. We remind the reader that the expression for
the entropy which leads to the dynamic equations for the
Maxwell ﬂuid does not satisfy the degeneracy condition
Eq. (2). In their papers Grmela and ¨Ottinger also noted
that the quadratic form of the entropy for the Maxwell
ﬂuid does not satisfy the condition (2). Speciﬁcally, if

one would assumes the quadratic form for the polymeric
entropy

then the gradient of entropy (S = Seq + Sp) would not
be in the null space of the Poisson operator. Thus, the
quadratic form of entropy is not a suitable one from the
point of view of its thermodynamic consistency.
We now concentrate on LIT and EIT version enlarged
with the conformation tensor given in Section IV. In or-
der to discern which of these results is valid we resort to
a previous work by V´azquez and L´opez de Haro [8]. In
that paper the equilibrium Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum
for the Maxwell ﬂuid was computed. This was done by
using a procedure by Mountain and by ﬂuctuating hy-
drodynamics based on two types of FDR. The ﬁrst of
them was of the δ-correlated type and the second one of
the exponentially correlated type which is the one pre-
scribed by Landau and Lifshitz for the case where a dis-
persive dissipation coeﬃcient is present. In the ﬁrst case
the Maxwell ﬂuid was described in the EIT framework
and in the second one the ﬂuid was described within
LIT. Mountain and ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics calcula-
tions rendered the same result only if the Maxwell ﬂuid
was described within LIT and the corresponding expo-
nentially correlated FDR was used. From this fact one
should conclude that a δ-correlated FDR does not lead
to the correct description of the Rayleigh-Brillouin spec-
trum. This is the case of the FDR in the extended version
of the viscoelastic ﬂuid GENERIC theory. At this point

9

we might conclude a number of facts in spite the situ-
ation is rather unsatisfactory. Firstly, we remark that
the GENERIC scheme allows an eﬀective deﬁnition of
the entropy of the system by respecting two fundamen-
tal physical principles, namely, the ﬁrst and second laws
of thermodynamics. The EIT extended with the dissi-
pative ﬂuxes leading to the quadratic form for entropy
is disqualiﬁed by its thermodynamic inconsistency. The
EIT extended with the conformation tensor will not ren-
der the expected Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum since the
Maxwell ﬂuid’s FDR within the formalism takes the form
of a δ-correlated FDR. Secondly, LIT is consistent from
two points of view. On the one hand, it satisﬁes the
prescribed degeneration conditions of GENERIC and on
the other, it describes in the correct way the ﬂuctuating
properties of the Maxwell ﬂuid leading to the expected
Rayleigh-Brillouin spectrum. Thirdly, thus one is forced
to conclude that the extended versions of ﬂuctuating irre-
versible thermodynamics should be revised. We end this
paper with the following conclusion. LIT is a proper ther-
modynamic framework to deal with even situations out
from equilibrium for which the extended theories have
claimed to require a set of variables in addition to the
usual set of conserved densities of LIT to characterize
the thermodynamic state.

A ﬂow of electrically conducting ﬂuid in the presence of a steady magnetic ﬁeld has
a tendency to become quasi two-dimensional, i.e. uniform in the direction of the mag-
netic ﬁeld, except in thin so-called Hartmann boundary layers. The condition for this
tendency is that of a strong magnetic ﬁeld, corresponding to large values of the dimen-
sionless Hartmann number (Ha >> 1). This is analogous to the case of low Ekman
number rotating ﬂows, with Ekman layers replacing Hartmann layers. This has been at
the origin of the homogeneous model for ﬂows in a rotating frame of reference, with
its rich structure: geostrophic contours and shear layers of Stewartson [Ste57, Ste66],
Munk [Mun50] and Stommel [Sto48]. In magnetohydrodynamics, the characteristic sur-
faces introduced by Kulikovskii [Kul68] play a role similar to the role of the geostrophic
contours. However, a general theory for quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics
is lacking. In this paper, a model is proposed which provides a general framework for
quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ﬂows. Not only can this model account for
otherwise disconnected past results, but it is also used to predict a new type of shear
layer, of typical thickness Ha−1/4. Two practical cases are then considered: the classical
problem of a fringing transverse magnetic ﬁeld across a circular pipe ﬂow, treated by
Holroyd and Walker [HW78], and the problem of a rectangular cross-section duct ﬂow in
a slowly varying transverse magnetic ﬁeld. For the ﬁrst problem, the existence of thick
shear layers of dimensionless thickness of order of magnitude Ha−1/4 explains why the
ﬂow expected at large Hartmann number was not observed in experiments. The second
problem exempliﬁes a situation where an analytical solution had been obtained in the
past [WL72] for the so-called “M-shape” velocity proﬁle, which is here understood as an
aspect of general quasi two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics.

1. Introduction

The relative inﬂuence of Lorentz forces versus viscous forces is measured by the dimen-
sionless Hartmann number Ha. At large Hartmann number, the ﬂow can be analyzed in
terms of an inviscid core ﬂow and viscous shear layers. This is very similar to the case
of low Ekman number ﬂows in a rotating frame of reference, for which two-dimensional
models are commonly used. The tendency of ﬂows of electrically conducting ﬂuids under
a DC magnetic ﬁeld to become two-dimensional has been known since the work of Hart-
mann and Lazarus [HL37a, HL37b]. A number of analytical [She53, CL61, Hun65] and
experimental [Mur53, Bra67] studies have conﬁrmed this trend in the laminar regime and
even in the next stage of so-called two-dimensional turbulence [Leh55, Kol72]. It was then
natural to take advantage of the well-known structure of the Hartmann layers to build

2

a model for the two-dimensional ﬂow. This was done by Sommeria and Moreau [SM82],
in terms of the core velocity and pressure. There have been also other two-dimensional
models using the electrical potential and pressure as main variables [MB94]. However
these models have all in common that the ﬂow is supposed to be contained between
two parallel planes with a uniform transverse magnetic ﬁeld. This constitutes a very
particular case as the subsequent developments show.

The work of Kulikovskii [Kul68] brought more generality since he considered electrically
insulating cavities of arbitrary shapes in arbitrary non-uniform magnetic ﬁelds. He shows
that there is still a kind of two-dimensionality as the variation of physical quantities like
pressure or electric potential along the magnetic lines can be obtained from the equations
of the core of the ﬂow. In addition, he shows that the quantity
, integral on a
magnetic line of the inverse of the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, plays a crucial role. Surfaces
made of magnetic lines with the same value for this integral are called characteristic
surfaces: Kulikovskii shows that the electric current and velocity have a tendency to
lie on these characteristic surfaces at large Hartmann number. These surfaces can be
considered as surfaces of least resistance to the ﬂow. A ﬂow can be forced to cross them
but this will cost more in terms of pressure gradient required than in the case of a ﬂow
. In a second paper [Kul73], Kulikovskii applies his asymptotic structure to
along them
†
particular conﬁgurations, showing the powerful predictions that can be made using the
concept of characteristic surfaces.

Later, the ideas of Kulikovskii have been applied by Holroyd and Walker [HW78] in the
case of a fringing transverse magnetic ﬁeld to a circular duct. The transverse magnetic
ﬁeld is uniform on both sides of a step change. The authors follow Kulikovskii and assume
that in the non-uniform region, the ﬂow follows strictly the characteristic surfaces and
that on each side it would then come back towards a fully-developed regime on a much
larger length scale Ha1/2, as shown from scaling analysis
. They then re-derive a two-
‡
dimensional model with uniform magnetic ﬁeld but non-uniform depth of the cavity
in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, in terms of pressure and electric potential. This
model is then solved using expansions in eigenfunctions on both sides, where pressure
and potential are matched in the central non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld region. In doing so,
they obtain the large Hartmann number asymptotic limit of the duct ﬂow with fringing
magnetic ﬁeld. Unfortunately, experiments performed under a large Hartmann number
by Holroyd [Hol79], Ha = 523 based on the radius of the pipe, showed that the observed
ﬂow was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the predicted one: it is modiﬁed in the same way
as expected but much less spectacularly. The reason for this discrepancy could not be
explained satisfactorily by invoking possible viscous eﬀects in the core or inertial eﬀects
since the Hartmann and interaction numbers were both large enough to discard such
eﬀects.

In a second attempt, Hua and Walker [HW89] derive two-dimensional equations not
only for variable depth but also for a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. The assumption of
so-called parallel magnetic lines is made, whereby the magnetic ﬁeld is supposed to be
pointing nearly in the same direction (z), although its intensity depends on the other
two directions (x and y). This model could be solved numerically without the need to
match the pressure and potential in the non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld region. The results
were consistent with experimental observations at comparable values of the Hartmann

†

For the same velocity, the ratio of pressure gradient required to drive a ﬂow across charac-
teristic surfaces is of the order of a factor Hartmann times the pressure gradient necessary to
drive a ﬂow along these surfaces.

This scaling appears for the ﬁrst time in [WL74].

number. Moreover, the numerical solution could be obtained for higher values of the
Hartmann number up to 7000. The authors remark that, even at this large value of
Hartmann number, the computed ﬂow is far from the asymptotic prediction of Holroyd
and Walker. As they expect the asymptotic regime to be reached when the square root
of the Hartmann number is large compared to unity they conclude rather unconvincingly
that √7000
84 is not large enough compared to unity to approach the asymptotic
regime.

≃

A closely related problem is that of a cylindrical duct with expansion in a uniform
transverse magnetic ﬁeld [WL74]. The topology of the characteristic surfaces is identical
to that of the duct of constant diameter with varying transverse magnetic ﬁeld. This
study is purely analytical, based on matching solutions on both sides of the region of
varying diameter.

Another important case where the characteristic surfaces play a crucial role is that of
the so-called entrance problem for rectangular duct ﬂows. When the ﬂow enters a region
of varying transverse magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬂow appears to concentrate along the sides of
the duct parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, forming a so-called M-shape velocity proﬁle. This
was reported from experimental observations in a range of papers [SSS70, BS66, Hol79,
Hol80]. For this conﬁguration again, Walker and co-workers played a major role in the
analysis of the ﬂow [WLH72, WL72, SW99].

Throughout this paper, the question of the relevance of a two-dimensional MHD model
will be addressed. It is hoped that the reader will be convinced that two-dimensional
equations of the type of those presented in [HW78, HW89] do represent MHD ﬂows
correctly, but that their scaling analysis has not received enough attention. Such analysis
provides a global understanding of MHD ﬂows. In particular, it will be shown how some
known results can be rederived (e.g. the M-shape proﬁle) and how an open question
arising in the case of a fringing transverse magnetic ﬁeld to a circular duct can be clariﬁed.
Also, the comparison with the case of rotating ﬂows will be made. As the two-dimensional
analysis is more advanced and better understood for rotating ﬂows, this comparison will
hopefully give support to the proposed MHD analysis. In addition, strong magnetic ﬁelds
are becoming widely available for research and industrial purposes, and understanding
the asymptotic limit of large Hartmann number ﬂows is becoming increasingly useful
in metallurgy or other processes involving liquid metals, like liquid metal cooling or
spallation neutron sources.

2. Three-dimensional asymptotics

In this section the diﬀerent types of three-dimensional boundary layers appearing in
MHD ﬂows or ﬂows in rotating systems of reference are reviewed brieﬂy. These well-known
features are recalled here for future comparison in section 3 with typical two-dimensional
structures and to stress the analogy between MHD and rotating ﬂows: the theory of
rotating ﬂows is more advanced than that of MHD ﬂows and the main point of this
paper is to show that the diversity of scaling laws found in the homogeneous model of
rotating ﬂows also exists for MHD ﬂows.

2.1. MHD three-dimensional asymptotics
The dimensionless vector position x, magnetic ﬁeld B, velocity ﬁeld u, electric current
density j, pressure ﬁeld p and electric potential ﬁeld φ are derived from their corre-
sponding dimensional quantities using the scales H, B0, ν/H, νσB0/H, ρν2/H 2 and
νB0 respectively, where H is a length-scale of the conﬁguration, B0 a typical value of
the applied magnetic ﬁeld, ρ the density of the ﬂuid, ν its kinematic viscosity and σ

4

its electrical conductivity. The magnetic ﬁeld is imposed externally and the magnetic
Reynolds number is assumed to be small so that the dimensionless magnetic ﬁeld B is
divergence-free and curl-free according to Maxwell’s equations. Moreover, inertia is also
neglected so that the dimensionless expressions of Navier-Stokes equation and Ohm’s law
take the following form:

In addition, the velocity ﬁeld u and electric current density j must be divergence-free
and on the boundary of the cavity enclosing the ﬂuid, the velocity must be zero as well
as the component of the electric current density parallel to the normal vector, since only
electrically insulated cavities are considered in this paper. One could consider a ﬁeld
of volume forces in the Navier-Stokes equation, like buoyancy forces in the Boussinesq
approximation, without aﬀecting the analysis of the structure of the ﬂow, provided this
force ﬁeld does not vary on a short length-scale. In the set of equations (2.1) and (2.2),
the Hartmann number Ha =

σ/ρνB0H is the single dimensionless parameter.

Asymptotic analysis refers to the limit of inﬁnite Hartmann number Ha. Since Hart-
mann, it has been known that the ﬂow can be divided into so-called core regions of ﬁnite
size and layers of small thickness. A simple way to put these structures in evidence is to
perform a local analysis of the governing equations (2.1), (2.2), so that one can consider
that the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform. Let us denote z the local coordinate aligned with
the magnetic ﬁeld and x, y other coordinates such that (x, y, z) is a direct orthonormal
j using the curl
system of reference. Taking twice the curl of (2.1) and substituting
of (2.2) leads to the following equation for the velocity ﬁeld:

2.1.1. Core regions

When the Hartmann number tends towards inﬁnity, the bi-Laplacian term cannot
compete in ﬁnite-size regions and one gets a region where the second derivative of the
velocity vanishes. In the absence of a strong electric current along the magnetic lines, it
can be shown that a two-dimensional velocity ﬁeld develops in these regions of ﬁnite ex-
tent. Even in the general case of a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld, a kind of two-dimensional
state exists, since the variations of velocity along the magnetic lines are readily obtained
from the governing equations.

2.1.2. Hartmann layers

Where the magnetic ﬁeld is not parallel to the wall, a Hartmann boundary layer
develops. Obviously, the direction of maximum variation is the normal direction to the

Viscous terms represented by the bi-Laplacian term in (2.3) can also play a role in
thin regions (boundary or free-shear layers) containing the magnetic ﬁeld direction. In

analysis shows that if these layers stretch along a distance of order unity along the

magnetic ﬁeld lines, their thickness must be of order Ha

Interestingly, another result can be derived from equation (2.5) in the case when the
cavity is of inﬁnite length in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. This gives a limit to the
size of the core region where the ﬂow is two-dimensional. There can be variations along
the magnetic lines on a large length-scale: if the typical cavity length scale perpendicular
to the magnetic lines is of order 1, both terms in (2.5) can balance provided the length-
scale along the magnetic lines is of order Hal. This situation arises typically when an
object of size of order unity is placed in an inﬁnite region: its eﬀect on a ﬂow around it
stretches along the magnetic lines as far as a distance of order Ha.

In the case of parallel layers and when the magnetic ﬁeld is non uniform, the local
analysis is not rigorous as one has to consider variations of the velocity on a length-
scale of order unity or more along magnetic lines. Equation (2.5) is therefore not correct.
However the scaling analysis remains valid: in a paper by Todd [Tod68], the rigorous
analysis of parallel layers developing along curved magnetic lines is performed and it is
shown that these layers are still lying on magnetic lines and are still of typical thickness
Ha−1/2.

2.1.4. Roberts layers

Roberts layers develop as a curved wall approaches a point where it becomes tangent
to the magnetic lines. The Hartmann layer solution presents a singularity as its thickness
diverges. The divergence is resolved by a so-called Roberts layer [Rob67]. If the curvature
is of order unity at the point of contact, a small region elongated in the magnetic ﬁeld
direction must satisfy the geometric constraint that its thickness across magnetic lines
scales as the square of its length along these lines. By scaling analysis of equation (2.5)
along
the only possibility is a thickness of order Ha

Now, instead of applying a steady magnetic ﬁeld B, it is supposed that the reference
system considered is rotating with the rate Ω along the z axis. A Coriolis force replaces
the Lorentz force in the momentum equation. The same dimensionless variables are used
for distance, velocity and pressure as in section 2.1. The governing equation can then be

Under the form (2.7) or (2.8), one can extract the possible structures for the velocity
ﬁeld using scaling analysis (see [Gre68] for a classical treatment). When a boundary layer
develops on a wall that does not contain the direction of rotation, a layer of dimensionless
thickness E1/2 develops: this is an Ekman layer and corresponds to the Hartmann layer
in MHD. It can also be seen that shear layers containing the direction of rotation can
develop. If the dimensionless length of the cavity in the direction of the rotation is of
order one, these layers must have a thickness of order E1/3: they are the strict equivalent
to the MHD parallel layers. When an object of dimensionless size one is held in place
in an inﬁnite domain, then its ‘wake’ extends a distance E−1 in the direction of the
rotation. Finally, similar regions to Roberts layers develop at the point of a curved
wall where it becomes tangent to the direction of rotation: these regions have a typical
length-scale of order E1/5 and E2/5 in the direction and perpendicular to the direction of

rotation respectively, if the curvature is of order unity. They correspond to a singularity
of diverging Ekman layers.

At this point, it can be seen that there is a close correspondence between the possible
structures in MHD and in rotating ﬂows according to the three-dimensional equations
(see Fig. 1 for a pictorial summary). However, it is not clear how one can possibly extract
the typical E1/4 main component of Stewartson’s layers from the scaling of the diﬀerential
operator 4 E−2 ∂2/∂z2 + (
2)3 appearing in equation (2.8). This becomes obvious when
two-dimensional equations are derived.

3. Two-dimensional models

A cavity of dimensionless length-scale unity in the direction of the imposed magnetic
ﬁeld or rotation is considered. As we have seen above in section 2, the largest three-
dimensional structures in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld or rotation
direction are of order Ha−1/2 or E1/3. Hence, if only larger perpendicular scales are
considered, the ﬂow consists simply of a two-dimensional core bounded by Hartmann or
Ekman layers. This is at the origin of the two-dimensional models.

3.1. MHD two-dimensional model

In most cases, MHD core ﬂows are two-dimensional, except when the forcing and bound-
ary conditions are such that an odd velocity proﬁle is generated along a magnetic ﬁeld
line (a linear variation in the core). In this case, the MHD braking is very strong: this
is the case referred to as ‘singular symmetry’ in [AGM96]. The other symmetry called
‘regular symmetry’ corresponds to an even velocity proﬁle (which is nearly uniform in
the core) along magnetic lines, and the MHD braking is Ha times weaker. Hence, the
general case bears resemblance with the ‘regular symmetry’ and corresponds indeed to
the idea of a two-dimensional ﬂow.

In the following analysis a cavity of general shape and a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld
are considered. Following most authors, the approximation of straight magnetic lines
is made here. In this approximation, the curvature of the magnetic lines is ignored,
the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld is taken as constant on each magnetic line but can
vary from one line to another. This is clearly an approximation intended to simplify
the analytical calculations, but it has been shown to be safe in the few studies where
this approximation was not made [Kul68, Tod68, AGM96]. This approximation does not
aﬀect the qualitative features of the ﬂows, although the imposed magnetic ﬁelds are not
physical since they are rotational.

As shown in Fig. 2, the geometry of the electrically insulated cavity consists of the
l, deﬁned
space situated between two surfaces, an upper surface
in a orthonormal coordinate system (x, y, z) by the two functions zu(x, y) and zl(x, y)
respectively. The z axis is chosen to coincide with the magnetic ﬁeld direction, in the
straight magnetic lines approximation. Its intensity depends on x and y, B = Bz(x, y)ez.
The functions zu, zl and Bz are dimensionless functions of the dimensionless coordinates
x and y, where the arbitrary scales H and B0 for length and magnetic ﬁeld intensity
deﬁned in section 2 continue to be used.

It is assumed that, in the core of the ﬂow, the velocity and electric current density
components perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld are independent of z. Using for instance
the value of these ﬁelds on a reference plane z = 0, one can deﬁne the two-dimensional
ﬁelds:

These governing equations are not suﬃcient to describe the MHD two-dimensional ﬂows.
First, one needs to take into account the global conservation of mass and of electric
charge. Second, one needs to take into account the contribution due to the Hartmann
layers in these conservation relationships.

−

The mass and charge conservation laws will be expressed in terms of global two-
dimensional mass and electric charge ﬂux densities Q and I, taking into account the
core and Hartmann layers contributions. The core contribution is obtained by multi-
plying the two-dimensional vector ﬁelds u0 and j0 by the length of the magnetic line
within the cavity zu
zl. The Hartmann contribution to the mass ﬂux is neglected as
this corresponds simply to a deﬁcit, as measured by the displacement thickness of the
Hartmann boundary layer. It introduces an error of order Ha−1, comparable to the ap-
proximations already made when assuming a two-dimensional core ﬂow. On the contrary,
the Hartmann layer contribution to the electric charge ﬂux is fundamental in MHD. It
is proportional to the core velocity adjacent to the Hartmann layer and in the direction
perpendicular to both this core velocity and the wall normal vector. The core velocity
adjacent to the Hartmann layer uc must be tangent to the wall and the integral of the
electric current over the Hartmann layer thickness IHa depends on the wall normal unit
vector n and uc (see [HS71]):

Both equations have almost a symmetrical structure. The curl of Navier-Stokes (3.14)
has a diﬀusion term for ψ on the left-hand side: it is related to the two-dimensional
vorticity of the ﬂow. The equation has a term of the form
h on the right-
hand side, with K = Bz/d. This fundamental term corresponds to the ﬂow of total
electric current crossing the characteristic surfaces. Finally, the last bi-Laplacian term
on ψ represents the eﬀect of viscosity in the two-dimensional ﬂow. This last term will
be shown to be negligible in most cases, and then equation (3.14) expresses that when
the electrical current goes across characteristic surfaces, this creates vorticity. Equation
(3.15) is similar, except that there is no equivalent to the last term of (3.14). It says
that when the ﬂow goes across characteristic surfaces, this creates a region of curl for the
electric current.

It is important to stress that the characteristic function K = Bz/d appears naturally
in these two-dimensional equations, as could be expected from previous analyses [Kul68,
AGM96]. The derivation and results presented above are close to those presented in
[Alb01]. This analysis is also very close to the analysis by Holroyd and Walker [HW78] and
Hua and Walker [HW89], where the main variables are the pressure and electric potential
instead of the streamfunctions ψ and h considered here. Also, they have neglected from
the beginning the viscous friction in the two-dimensional ﬂow. Although the analysis
above about the signiﬁcance of the terms is not carried out in papers [HW78, HW89], it
can be checked after rearranging diﬀerent terms that equations (17) and (18) in [HW89]
display the same structure as (3.14) and (3.15) of this paper, with the characteristic
function Bz/d playing an important role.

Equations (3.14) and (3.15) are going to be solved rigorously in sections 4 and 5.

The motivation for these diﬀerent treatments is that the Hartmann currents are nearly

†

curl-free while their divergence can be signiﬁcant.

Nevertheless, it is important to perform a scaling analysis of these equations to identify
the possible structures that can be expected in two-dimensional ﬂows. For the purpose of
the scaling analysis, the depth d and magnetic ﬁeld Bz can be considered to be uniform
and unity in all terms except for the two terms involving the gradient of K, since variation
of K = Bz/d is crucial. Moreover, in the spirit of a local analysis, a change of coordinates
is introduced, in which (x, y) is replaced by orthonormal intrinsic coordinates (r, s),
where r varies in the direction perpendicular to the characteristic surfaces, while s varies
along the characteristic surfaces. The symbol G is chosen to denote the magnitude of
the gradient of K: G =
. With these simplifying assumptions and notations,
equations (3.14) and (3.15) take the form:

(Bz/d)

Taking the Laplacian of (3.16) and substituting h using (3.17) provides the fundamental

(3.18)

Under this form, it is convenient to perform a scaling analysis of the two-dimensional
MHD ﬂows. First of all, in the absence of thin layers, the term with the largest power of
Ha is dominant. Consequently the second variations of ψ along the characteristic surfaces
must be zero. In fact, very often the ﬁrst variation of ψ will be zero along theses surfaces,
in order to minimize Ohmic dissipation (see equation (3.17)). This corresponds to the
‘core regions’ of two-dimensional ﬂows. Diﬀerent type of layers can appear, depending
on whether they develop in a direction parallel to characteristic surfaces or not. If they
develop along a wall not parallel to the characteristic surfaces, then equation (3.18)
becomes:

Ha

∂4ψ
∂n4 = Ha2 G2 cos2θ

∂2ψ
∂n2 +

∂6ψ
∂n6 ,

(3.19)

where n is the normal direction to the wall and θ is the angle between the normal to
the wall and the direction of characteristic surfaces. The thinnest structure that can
emerge from equation (3.19) is obtained when the last term (viscous core friction) is
balanced with the ﬁrst term (Hartmann layer friction). This leads to a typical thickness
of Ha−1/2 and must immediately be discarded as this scale corresponds to the scale of
the three-dimensional parallel layers. Indeed, the three-dimensional analysis in section
2.1 shows that for a length scale of order Ha−1/2 or less in the direction perpendicular to
the magnetic ﬁeld, the variations of velocity in the core of the ﬂow are of order unity in
the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld: hence the two-dimensional model ceases to be valid.
This means that the core friction will always be negligible compared to Hartmann layer
friction at larger scales. The other possibility is to balance Hartmann friction with the
topographic term: this leads to a layer of typical thickness Ha−1/2G−1cos−1θ. Again, if
G and cosθ are of order unity, this two-dimensional layer is not physical as it is replaced
by a Ha−1/2 three-dimensional parallel layer. However, if G cosθ is very small compared
to unity, this thickness Ha−1/2G−1cos−1θ is larger than the parallel layers and consti-
tutes a valid two-dimensional layer. This type of layer has been analyzed by Walker and
Ludford [WL74] who started from the three-dimensional equations. These layers will be
examined in section 5 from the easier point of view of the two-dimensional equations.
They are similar to Stommel layers [Sto48] in rotating ﬂows, as the main balance involves

12

Thierry Alboussi`ere

topographic eﬀects and friction in Ekman layers. However, as will be seen in the next
section, the Stommel solution does not apply, as the core viscous friction turns out to be
larger than the Ekman friction in rotating ﬂows. Hence, Stommel layers are replaced by
thicker Munk layers [Mun50].

If one considers now a layer developing along a characteristic surface, equation (3.18)

can be written:

Ha

∂4ψ

∂r4 = Ha2 G2 ∂2ψ
∂s2 +

∂6ψ
∂r6 ,

(3.20)

Again, it can be seen that the last core friction term will always be negligible on scales
larger than Ha−1/2 and can thus be ignored in this two-dimensional analysis.

The scaling analysis depends on the scale along the characteristic surface. If this scale
is of order unity (∂/∂s
1), then the balance between the Hartmann friction term and
the topographic term leads to a layer of typical thickness Ha−1/4G−1/2 which is much
thicker than parallel layers even if G is of order unity. This type of layer will be discussed
in section 4.

∼

Finally, if the cavity is inﬁnite in the direction of the characteristic surfaces and of
size unity in the perpendicular direction, equation (3.20) can provide the typical long
1,
length-scale of development of structures along characteristic surfaces. If ∂/∂r
then the balance between Hartmann friction and topographic eﬀects leads to a scale
Ha1/2G. Walker and co-workers [WL74] had found that a distance of order Ha1/2 was
the length-scale necessary from the position where the magnetic ﬁeld was varying to
reach a fully-developed ﬂow in a pipe with transverse magnetic ﬁeld.

∼

There can be other possibilities like the case when a wall would become tangent to the
characteristic surfaces: similarly to Roberts layers, they would correspond to a singularity
in the Ha−1/2G−1 layer. For a curvature of order unity, scaling analysis of (3.20) when
the length-scale perpendicular to the wall scales as the square of the length-scale along
the characteristic surfaces, one gets a region of size Ha−1/3G−2/3 by Ha−1/6G−1/3. The
structures discussed above are believed to be the most typical ones and are illustrated in
Fig. 4.

As discussed above, the core viscous term

ψ in equation (3.16) is always negli-
gible when the two-dimensional equations are valid. Without this term, equation (3.16)
may be multiplied by Ha−3/2, then successively added to and subtracted from equation
(3.17) providing the following equations:

Those familiar with Shercliﬀ variables will notice that ψ/Ha1/2
h play here a corre-
sponding role. The privileged direction is that of characteristic surfaces instead of the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld for Shercliﬀ variables. This may help to accept the typical
length-scales derived above. This also indicates that the magnitude of the electric current
(h) is of order Ha−1/2 that of the velocity (ψ) in general.

3.2. The homogeneous model of rotating ﬂows
The corresponding two-dimensional model in the case of rotation is called the the homo-
geneous model. Its derivation can be found in many textbooks (e.g. Greenspan [Gre68])
and is sketched here in order to emphasize the similarity with the MHD model. At the
upper and lower surfaces, the role of the Ekman layer is now to produce a cross-ﬂow with
respect to the core ﬂow direction. The integral of this cross ﬂow scales as E1/2 times
the core velocity. For this term and for the purpose of this approximate derivation, the
angles between the direction of rotation and the wall normals are neglected. The total

Again, one can use the streamfunction ψ, deﬁned in (3.11) and substitute it for u0 in

under the assumption that d is of order unity. Although the order of derivation of the
terms and the powers of Ekman number are diﬀerent from those of Hartmann number
in the MHD case, there is a strong analogy with the MHD equation (3.18). The term on
the left-hand side represents the contribution of the Ekman (resp. Hartmann) layer, the
ﬁrst term on the right-hand side corresponds to the eﬀect of topography while the last
term is related to shear forces within the two-dimensional bulk ﬂow.

In terms of boundary-layer structures, equation (3.26) can be used to estimate the
thickness of possible boundary layers arising in rotating ﬂows. For a cavity of constant
depth, there can be an equilibrium between the ﬁrst and last term in (3.26) on a typ-
ical length-scale E1/4. This is the thickness of shear boundary layers between regions
of diﬀerent core velocity [Ste57]. Along western boundaries, the equilibrium between
the second and third terms brings a length-scale E1/3/β, corresponding to Munk layers
[Mun50, CW77, Wal75]. The equations are not symmetrical between East and West,
owing to the term β∂ψ/∂s in equation (3.26), and no boundary layer can develop on
eastern boundaries. The development length of a ﬂow along geostrophic contours after a
disturbance can be estimated as E−1/2 [Wal74].

4. Circular duct with fringing magnetic ﬁeld

A long electrically insulating circular duct is submitted to a transverse magnetic ﬁeld
(Fig. 5). The axis of the pipe is taken to be the x-direction, while the direction of
the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is taken to be the z direction. All dimensions are made
dimensionless using the diameter of the pipe. From x =
2 the magnetic
ﬁeld intensity is assumed to be uniform. Its value B0 is used as our scale for magnetic
, the dimensionless
ﬁeld, hence its dimensionless value is unity, while from x = 2 to x =
magnetic ﬁeld is uniform with an intensity twice as large. Between x =
2 and x = 2,
the dimensionless magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to have the form

which makes Bz continuous, as well as its ﬁrst and second derivatives, from x =

nents of the magnetic ﬁeld are assumed to be zero, although this ﬁeld does not satisfy
the condition of a curl-free magnetic ﬁeld strictly speaking.

The characteristic surfaces contain the z direction and are best made visible in the
(x,y) plane where they appear as lines. On Fig. 6, some characteristic surfaces are drawn:
they correspond to the case of a circular cylinder and to the distribution deﬁned by the
magnetic ﬁeld (4.1). However, the x and y coordinates are stretched diﬀerently. The
ﬁgure is drawn for the particular case of a duct of length 8, but this is irrelevant since
the characteristic surface are independent of x when x <
2 or x > 2. In fact, the
length of the cavity used for numerical calculations will be adapted to each value of the
Hartmann number (see section 4.1) so that it is always longer than the development
length of the ﬂow.

−

The traditional β-plane approximation corresponds to the linearized variation of latitude,

but this is equivalent to a change in depth, as far as the two-dimensional model is concerned.

This problem has been initially investigated by Holroyd and Walker [HW78] and later
by Hua and Walker [HW89]. In the next section 4.1 a two-dimensional numerical calcu-
lation of the ﬂow is performed using the two-dimensional model described in section 3.1.
This is somewhat similar to the work done by Hua and Walker [HW89], but higher values
of the Hartmann number are investigated here. In section 4.2, an asymptotic model used
by Holroyd and Walker is re-expressed in terms of the streamfunctions ψ and h instead
of pressure and electrical potential, and is then solved with a higher accuracy (in eﬀect
with more terms in a series of Chebyshev polynomials). In this model, it is assumed that
the non-uniform region is short enough so that the ﬂow follows the characteristic surfaces
exactly on its length-scale. It will be shown that the numerical two-dimensional model
and this asymptotic model are in perfect agreement. They both lead to layers of thickness
Ha−1/4 and it will be shown that the two-dimensional numerical results approach the
asymptotic results when Ha−1/4 is small compared to one.

4.1. Numerical two-dimensional results

The two-dimensional equations (3.14) and (3.15) are solved in this section, except for the
two-dimensional viscous term. This is the last term is equation (3.14) and it has been
shown in section 3.1 that the boundary or free layers arising from it are always as thin
as parallel layers, Ha−1/2, hence cannot be modelled correctly by the two-dimensional
model. Consequently, this term is removed from the equation and the condition of no-slip
on solid boundaries is dropped accordingly. These equations are re-written here, in the

The symmetry of the problem with respect to the axis y = 0 is exploited and the domain
L, where L is taken
of integration is only half of the initial domain: y
large enough so that the ﬂow is established in the x direction at these two ends. The
development length scales as Ha1/2 and this is taken to be the length of the integration
domain, L = 0.5Ha1/2. The results show that the ﬂow is independent of x well before
the ends.

A problem with this domain is that its length is large for large Hartmann numbers
and it becomes diﬃcult to build a mesh with a reasonable number of nodes which
can cope with the short and large length-scales involved. To overcome that diﬃculty
a change in x coordinate is made, which maps the long physical domain onto a ﬁc-
titious domain of length 2. The change in x-coordinate used here is of the form x =
2.5 sinh
, where xf is a ﬁctitious x coordinate (see Fig. 7). This
type of stretching creates a distortion that is more and more pronounced towards the
ends. The following boundary conditions are applied: on y = 0, ψ = 0 and h = 0; on
y = 0.5, ψ = 1 and h = 0; on xf =

1, ∂ψ/∂xf = 0 and ∂h/∂x = 0.

Two types of two-dimensional plots will be shown in this section, none of them involving
the artiﬁcial xf coordinate: one type is a general view of a large part of the domain where
the xHa−1/2 will be used while the other type is a limited view of the physical domain,
between x =

2 and x = 2, where coordinate x will be used.

The equations are solved using FreeFem+ [PHB+], a free-licence software developed
at INRIA. This is a two-dimensional ﬁnite element solver, coupled to an anisotropic
unstructured mesh generator that can automatically reﬁne the mesh where solutions
have large gradients. Triangular, ﬁrst order elements are used. Typically, after a couple
of mesh adaptations, the mesh looks like the one displayed on Fig. 7, although the meshes
used for the calculations contain many more vertices (up to 50, 000).

It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the large scale structure of the ﬂow and electric cur-
rent circulation becomes independent of the value of the Hartmann number, at large
Hartmann number, i.e. more than 106 or so. Between Ha = 104 and Ha = 106, some
diﬀerences in position of the iso-ψ lines may be observed and also of the iso-h lines. It
is also conﬁrmed from these results that the development length of the ﬂow upstream

and downstream, i.e. along the characteristic surfaces is of order Ha1/2. However, the
plots in Fig. 8 do not provide a clear information on the structure of the ﬂow around the
region of varying magnetic ﬁeld. This is due to the fact that the axial coordinate is scaled
with a factor Ha1/2 in order to give a global view of the ﬂow, hence the central region,
2 is squeezed enormously in the x direction. The following Fig. 9 shows the
−
same results as Fig. 8 when only the central part of the duct is singled out. It can also be
seen that the ﬂow becomes independent of the Hartmann number, when it is larger than
106. It can also be seen that, on this length-scale of order unity, the velocity and electric
current streamlines become closer and closer to the characteristic surfaces (compare with
ﬁgure 4) at large Hartmann number.

It is also interesting to look at the velocity proﬁles of the x-component of the velocity
ﬁeld across the duct. On Fig. 10, the velocity proﬁle is shown between y = 0 and y = 0.5
at the axial positions x =

2 and x = 2 respectively.

One can see that the velocity proﬁle presents a singularity at inﬁnite Hartmann num-
ber. This singularity is situated on the characteristic surface which splits in the region

shown at x = 2, and at yc = 0.5 cos(π/6) at x =

to the y position where the depth of the cylinder in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
is half the diameter of the duct. On Fig. 11, the velocity proﬁles are plotted again, in
logarithmic coordinates, to put in evidence the singularity arising at large Hartmann
number. On the left (x =

ﬁle behaves asymptotically like y−1/2 when Ha increases. On x =

Having established the nature of the singularity developing along this particular char-
acteristic surface which splits as a result of the change of magnetic ﬁeld, one can also
examine how this singularity is smoothed out at high but ﬁnite Hartmann number. As
predicted in section 3.1 there is in fact a free shear layer of thickness Ha−1/4. This is
because the change in magnetic ﬁeld occurs on a typical length scale unity, so when the
velocity proﬁle is examined at a distance of order unity from the change in magnetic
ﬁeld, a layer of thickness Ha−1/4 is expected. This can be seen on Fig. 10 and 11 as the
singularity is smoothed on a shorter and shorter length scale, δ, as the Hartmann num-
ber is increased. One can actually extract quantitatively the ‘smoothing’ thickness out
of these velocity proﬁles. If we assume that the velocity ux is at its maximum umax on
a length-scale δ, then the following integrals of the velocity proﬁle can be approximated
as:

as the contribution around the maximum velocity dominates the integrals. It then follows
from (4.11) that the following value for δ is an objective measure of the thickness of the
layer which can be computed from the proﬁles:

a change occurs on a length-scale unity. Here the magnetic ﬁeld changes on a length
scale unity and the layer between the stagnant and moving ﬂuids is indeed of thickness
Ha−1/4. These ﬁndings bring an answer to the discussion started in the conclusion of
the paper by Holroyd and Walker [HW78]. In their conclusion, about the ‘nature of the
velocity proﬁle near the moving ﬂuid/stagnant ﬂuid boundary in the non-uniform region’,
the two authors express diﬀerent views: ‘J.S.W believes the velocity gradients to be large
(Ha−1/2) might separate
yet
the moving and stagnant ﬂuid’. The answer proposed here is intermediate, with a layer
of thickness Ha−1/4. In addition, it is observed that the asymptotic velocity proﬁle itself
diverges near yc, not only its gradient.

If one observes now the velocity proﬁle on the right-hand side of the change in magnetic
ﬁeld, one can also measure the size of the free-shear layer at y = 0, lying on the dividing
characteristic surface. Using the same expression (4.12), the thickness of this layer is
plotted on Fig. 12 (right). It can be seen that, at high Hartmann number, the thickness
decreases as Ha−1/6. This new exponent arises because the characteristic function K
shows an extremum at y = 0. Indeed, the power law Ha−1/4 was derived under the
assumption that K has a ﬁnite gradient G. Here, G is not constant at the scale of the
layer, but is a linear function of y, G = cz, where c is a constant. When substituting this
expression for G in equation (3.20), it is possible to carry on a similar scaling analysis as
in 3.1 to ﬁnd out that a shear layer of thickness Ha−1/6 should develop near y = 0 for
the axial position x = 2.

4.2. The model of Holroyd and Walker revisited

The method of eigenfunction expansion used by Holroyd and Walker [HW78] (directly
adapted itself from a paper by Walker and Ludford [WL74]) has been followed with two
changes. First, the problem is solved here using the streamfunctions ψ and h, rather the
the pressure and electric potential p and φ, and secondly, as many as 1000 eigenvectors
have been used while Holroyd and Walker could only compute 60 at the time of their
publication. This increase in computer power is necessary to observe the results found in
the previous section with FreeFem. In this method, the magnetic ﬁeld is modelled as a
pure step function and the velocity proﬁles are calculated at a distance x = 2 upstream

The results of this modelling are very similar to those obtained by ﬁnite element
analysis (Fig. 10 and 11). This can be seen as a conﬁrmation that the approach of
Holroyd and Walker was correct. The results are not identical though for two reasons.
First, at Ha = 1012 and to a lesser extend at Ha = 1011, one can see numerical oscillations
on the right of Fig. 14, showing that 1000 eigenmodes is not suﬃcient. Secondly, the peak

values in shear layers are not identical because x =
signiﬁcance in both models. They are the ends of the gradient region of magnetic ﬁeld
in the ﬁnite element modelling while they are exact positions with respect to a sharp
change in magnetic ﬁeld intensity in the method of matched expansions.

5. The entry problem in rectangular ducts

The so-called entry problem is another typically relevant issue regarding the two-
dimensional MHD ﬂow structure. This phenomenon concerns the changes in a duct ﬂow
when the intensity of an imposed transverse magnetic ﬁeld varies along the direction of
the ﬂow, for instance when a duct ﬂow enters (or leaves) a magnet, hence the term ‘entry
problem’. In electrically insulating rectangular ducts, it is observed that the ﬂow remains
quasi two-dimensional but concentrates near the two parallel walls to the magnetic ﬁeld
while becoming very weak in the middle of the duct: because of the no-slip condition at
the wall, this has been described as an M-shape velocity proﬁle when plotted from one
parallel wall to the other. An entirely equivalent problem is that of a ﬂow in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld but with a variable cross-section area along the duct. Indeed, only changes
in the value of the characteristic function Bz/d are relevant. Here, we choose to consider
the case of a uniform depth d = 1 and a variable magnetic ﬁeld intensity Bz as a function
of x, the longitudinal coordinate along the duct axis. As before z is the coordinate in
the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and y is the other coordinate in the plane of the
cross-section.

This problem will be treated using equations (3.14) and (3.15), and our choice leads

to simpliﬁed governing equations:

Then, following our analysis in section cr, the last term of equation (5.1) – of viscous
origin – will be neglected as it leads to thin parallel layers, too thin for the condition
of two-dimensional ﬂow to apply. Assuming that its role will be simply to ensure the
no-slip condition, this term is removed while the no-slip condition is dropped. The set of
equations becomes:

These equations are solved in section 5.2, for the case of a duct ﬂow with a ramp of
transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Before, in section 5.1, a local analytical solution for equations
(5.3) and (5.4) is derived corresponding to boundary layers analogous to Stommel layers
for rotating ﬂows. Finally, in section 5.3, an attempt is made to calculate the ﬂow in the
duct cross-section in a region of axially varying Bz: it is compared to and gives support
to the two-dimensional results.

5.1. Analytical local solution

One considers here a region near a side wall, where the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld Bz
is denoted G. In the Laplacian terms, the normal derivative along y is assumed to be
dominant compared to the axial x derivative. Equations (5.3) and (5.4) can be written:

explaining that the ﬂow is conﬁned near the lateral walls in a boundary layer of typical
thickness Ha−1/2G−1, when the scale for magnetic ﬁeld strength is chosen locally (Bz =
1). As long as the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld G is very small compared to one, the two-
dimensional structure of the layer is guaranteed and its velocity and electric current
density must be exponential.

5.2. Numerical two-dimensional results

A duct of uniform dimensionless depth unity, width equal to 2, and length 8 is considered.
The upstream and downstream region occupy each one fourth of the length of the duct
and have a uniform transverse magnetic ﬁeld, of intensity 1
2G and 1 + 2G respectively,
while the middle part is submitted to a uniform gradient G, Bz = 1 + Gx. On the lateral
1, the electrically insulating condition can be written h = 0 and the condition
walls, y =
of impermeable walls is written ψ = 0 on the lower wall at y =
.
†
At the ends of our duct, we apply the condition that h and ψ have no normal gradient.
This is consistent with the fact the ﬂow is nearly fully established at the ends.

1 and ψ = 1 at y = 1

The streamlines of the computed solution are shown on Fig. 15 for Ha = 105 and three
values of the gradient of magnetic ﬁeld applied, G = 0.05, G = 0.1 and G = 0.2. It can
be seen that the side layers become thicker as G decreases. In the real three-dimensional
case, it is expected that a parallel layer will exist, as a sublayer within this thicker side
layer. The exponential velocity distribution (5.7) has been compared with the calculated
distribution with FreeFem: the agreement is excellent.

5.3. Local solution in a cross-section

As we have seen in section 5.1, the solution of the duct ﬂow with a gradient of magnetic
ﬁeld is local: it is suﬃcient to know the local value of the magnetic ﬁeld Bz and the local
value of the gradient G to determine completely the boundary layer solution, providing Bz
and G do not vary signiﬁcantly on an axial length-scale comparable to the layer thickness.
As a consequence, it is expected that the three-dimensional ﬂow can be computed locally
in a cross section, within some simplifying assumptions.

Let us assume that the ﬂow will be mainly streamwise, and that its streamwise gradient
is small compared to its gradient in the cross-section. Navier-stokes equation can be
written in the streamwise direction:

This set of equations is solved for the same geometry as considered in section (5.2). The
cross-section has dimension 1 along the magnetic ﬁeld direction and 2 in the transverse
direction. Because of the symmetries of the conﬁguration, we solve this problem in a
quarter of the cross-section.

Finally, we need to specify boundary conditions for ux, φ and ∂p/∂x. The conditions
on ux and φ are obvious, with ux vanishing on the walls, and ∂φ/∂n = 0 as electrically
insulating boundaries are considered. Only approximate boundary conditions can be
found for ∂p/∂x; the assumption that this variable is going to be nearly independent of
z is made. This assumption is true within the core, it is also quite true within Hartmann
layers as they are so thin that pressure cannot change signiﬁcantly across them, and we
also assume that three-dimensional parallel layers (Ha−1/2) are thin enough so that they
cannot cause large z-dependence of ∂p/∂x. Then, integrating equation (5.21) across the
whole cross-section tells us that, along parallel walls, the normal derivative of ∂p/∂x is
proportional to the total volume ﬂow rate though the duct, Q:

while this derivative vanishes on Hartmann layer walls. An arbitrary value Q = 2 will be
used in the calculations so that the mean velocity is unity.

The distribution of axial velocity, electric potential and axial pressure gradient was
calculated with FreeFem++, an improved version of FreeFem+ where it is possible to
used triangular second order ﬁnite elements. This proved necessary as Hartmann layers
were resolved for Hartmann number up to 105. In this cross-section modelling, Hartmann
layers have to be very well resolved as the electric current ﬂowing through them is a key
ingredient in the establishment of Ha−1/2G−1 layers.

Some results are shown in Fig. 17, for a ﬁxed gradient G = 0.2, and increasing Hart-
mann numbers, from 10 to 105. As expected, shear layers of thickness Ha−1/2G−1 develop
and parallel layers of thickness Ha−1/2 are sublayers: their role is indeed to bring the
velocity to zero at the wall. The velocity proﬁle at z = 0 is compared with the analytical

The agreement is very good, the small departure being due to the ﬂow deﬁcit in parallel
layers at large Hartmann number and to the deﬁcit in Hartmann layers at smaller Hart-
mann numbers. This shows that our local problem in a cross-section (equations (5.19),
(5.20) and (5.21)) is a good representation of MHD ﬂows for entry problems. It is also a
direct conﬁrmation that the results of two-dimensional modelling can be conﬁrmed from
a model where Hartmann layers are eﬀectively calculated.

6. Concluding remarks

The structure of MHD ﬂows under large Hartmann numbers has been investigated
for an arbitrary geometry of the container and magnetic ﬁeld distribution. A set of two
equations governing the two-dimensional mass ﬂux streamfunction ψ and electric charge
ﬂux streamfunction h has been used, however it would be equivalent to consider other
variables such as pressure p and electric potential φ as in [HW78]. The reason why mass
and electric ﬂuxes are preferred is that this approach shows clearly which properties of
Hartmann and Ekman layer play a key role in the two-dimensional equations (see section
3). In the case of rotating ﬂows, the key property of Ekman layers is to carry a mass ﬂux
in the direction perpendicular to the core velocity. In the case of MHD ﬂows, the key
property of Hartmann layers is to carry an electric current in the direction perpendicular
to the core velocity.

The originality of the present work consists largely in the scaling analysis of these MHD
two-dimensional equations. It has been shown that shear layers of thickness Ha−1/4 can
develop. In addition, the analogy between rotating ﬂows and MHD ﬂows has been further
developed, so that for instance it is now clear that the analogue of Stommel layers are
those analyzed by Walker and Ludford [WL72] of thickness of order Ha−1/2G−1.

It may be that some of the results presented in this paper, especially those concerning
layers of thickness Ha−1/4, will never realistically apply. In industrial MHD situations,
one may envisage Hartmann numbers up to 105, with 10 Tesla and 10 cm length-scale for
a liquid metal. However, even in this case, it may be interesting to know what the ﬂow
structure would be at higher Hartmann numbers, as a tendency towards this structure will
already exist at lower Hartmann numbers. In the astrophysical and geophysical context,
it is easy to ﬁnd higher estimates of Hartmann numbers. For instance, in the liquid
108 depending on whether this is based
Earth core, one can reach Ha
5 10−3) estimate for the magnetic ﬁeld
on a poloidal (B
intensity (see [CBNM02]). Nevertheless, rotating eﬀects, inertial eﬀects and transport of
magnetic ﬁeld are so important that the Hartmann number is not the key dimensionless
parameter.

A number of possible extensions of this work can be envisaged. First, in this paper, the
use of the straight magnetic lines approximation has been made and a more accurate two-
dimensional model could be obtained by taking into account of the true magnetic ﬁeld
distribution. Although the results would be changed quantitatively, it is not expected
that the ﬂow structure would be altered signiﬁcantly. Secondly, the present analysis can
be extended to analyse free-surface ﬂows. The position of the free surface then becomes

an additional unknown and the nature of Hartmann layers changes : they become much
less active in the sense that the electric current ﬂowing along them is drastically reduced
compared to a wall-bounded Hartmann layer. Shear layers of a new type are expected
as the balance in our equation (3.18) will be changed. A third possible extension would
be to consider the combined eﬀect of rotation and magnetic ﬁeld. This is typical of
astrophysical or planetary dynamics. When rotation and magnetic ﬁeld have an identical
direction, there is certainly a predominantly two-dimensional ﬂow. In the general case of
diﬀerent orientations, it is far from obvious that such a two-dimensional dynamics will
develop, unless one eﬀect (rotation or magnetic ﬁeld) is dominant compared to the other
one.

The analogy with rotating ﬂows has been used as an example to follow in the MHD
case. However, if one takes the opposite view and wonder what should be the analogous
of Ha−1/4 layers, one can go back to equation (3.26) for the homogeneous model. If one
considers a change on a length-scale unity along a geostrophic contour, one may wonder
what the thickness δ of the shear layer along that contour should be. In Oceans, as β
is small, the answer is that it should be of order E1/4β−1/2 and that it is the result
of the competition between topographic eﬀects and Ekman pumping eﬀects. This layer
is thicker than the E1/4 Stewartson layer, which corresponds to the balance between
bulk viscous eﬀects and Ekman pumping. Are there shear layers, lying along geostrophic
contours, of thickness of order E1/4β−1/2?

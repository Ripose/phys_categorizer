Abstract

A relativistic Navier-Stokes equation is constructed as the equation of
motion of a gauge-invariant bosonic lagrangian. It is shown that the quantum-
electrodynamic-like lagrangian is suitable for this purpose with a particular
−c2
. The equation of
form of gauge ﬁeld, Aµ =
motion coincides with the classical Navier-Stokes equation at non-relativistic
limit |~v| ≪ c.

The ﬂuid dynamics is described by the well known Navier-Stokes (NS) equation.
The equation is derived from either the Newton’s second law or mass conservation
law. However, in the relativistic ﬂuid dynamics such as turbulent cosmology, quark-
gluon-plasma and so on the equation should be generalized properly since neither
the classical continuity equation nor the mass conservation are always valid. On the
other hand, straightforward relativistic generalizations of the NS equations result
in rather incomplete theories [1, 2]. As argued in [3], these theories are non-causal,
unstable and without a well posed initial value formulation. Another non-trivial
approaches have succeeded thereafter in producing a class of causal dissipative ﬂuid
theories [4]. However, those achievements are at the expense of increasing signiﬁ-
cantly the number of dynamical ﬁelds to describe the ﬂuid, but which have never
been directly observed in real ﬂuids. Moreover, so far all approaches have always
assumed that the classical continuity equation of ﬂuid is always valid [5], although
this prejudice can not actually be guaranteed in relativistic case.

In our previous works, we have proposed an alternative approach to constructing
the classical NS equation from ﬁrst principle using the lagrangian method instead
of starting from the classical continuity equation. The NS equation is derived as
the equation of motion (EOM) of relativistic and gauge-invariant bosonic lagrangian
through the Euler-Lagrange equation. It has been shown that motivated by simi-
larities between the Maxwell and NS equations [6], the classical NS equation can be
reproduced directly from such lagrangian with a particular form of gauge ﬁeld Aµ
[7]. However, the formulation does not obey a consistent transition from relativistic
to non-relativistic dynamics.

In this paper, we follow the same approach and extend it with keeping Lorentz
invariances consistently in all stages. We introduce the same relativistic gauge-
invariant lagrangian and then derive the EOM which is still Lorentz invariant. The
classical NS equation is further obtained at its non-relativistic limit respectively.

Let us consider a general non-Abelian gauge transformation. Following the same
procedure as done in [6], the gauge-invariant lagrangian for a bosonic ﬁeld Φ is
written as,

where,

l = (∂µΦ)† (∂µΦ) + V (Φ) + lA ,

As argued and shown in [6], one can obtain the Maxwell-like equation from the
NS equation by replacing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds with the Lamb vector and
vorticity, i.e. ~E → ~l ≡ ~ω × ~v and ~B → ~ω ≡ ~▽ × ~v. This result gives a clue that one
can further construct the NS lagrangian similar to the quantum-electrodynamic-like
lagrangian represented by lA above. Actually this claim has been proven by taking
φa, ~Aa
a speciﬁc form of gauge ﬁeld, Aa
with ~v is ﬂuid
(cid:16)
velocity and V is any potentials induced by conservative forces [7]. However, it is
clear that this choice breaks the Lorentz invariance explicitely. On the other hand,
this choice suggests that in the ﬂuid dynamics the scalar potential should be the
total energy which consists of its kinetic energy and external potential in density or
mass unit, while the vector potential describes the dynamics in term of its velocity.
Hereafter let us concern lA in Eq. (2) as the NS lagrangian, i.e. lNS = lA.

Having the NS lagrangian at hand, we can now proceed further. Using the
µ and Eq. (2), we obtain the following EOM,

If Aµ is considered as a “ﬂuid ﬁeld” representing a ﬂuid bunch for each a, then
we have a system of multi ﬂuid bunches governed by a single EOM. A non-trivial
relation is obtained for µ 6= ν which should lead to the NS equation as shown below.
We are now ready to derive the EOM relevant for relativistic ﬂuid dynamics
(6). Concerning the clue suggested by previous result in [7] and the
using Eq.
straightforward relativistic generalizations in [1], it is convinceable to deﬁne the
gauge ﬁeld Aa

with the scalar and vector potentials as below,

where Vrel denotes the external relativistic potential. We also retain the velocity of
light c to keep track the non-relativistic limit later on. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (7)
reﬂects the relativistic version of kinetic energy in mass unit.

Substituting Eqs. (7) and (8) into Eq. (6), we obtain the so-called relativistic

and some additional forces, that is the “current force” ~˜J and ~v × ø relevant for
rotational ﬂuid (ø 6= 0). This result justiﬁes our choice for the potentials as written

We should remark few points here. First, the potential contained in the scalar
potential is induced by the external conservative forces work only on the ﬂuid ﬁeld
Aµ. In contrary the potentials in the lagrangian represent the interactions among
the ﬁelds. For example, the potential V (Φ) in Eq. (1) would contain self-interaction
µAaµ in Eq. (2) induces an inter-
of the “medium ﬁeld” Φ. Also the potential J a
action between the ﬂuid ﬁeld and its medium. Secondly, this enables us to incor-
porate the ﬂuid system under for instance gravitational force without dealing with
un-established gravitational lagrangian. Lastly, in the classical ﬂuid dynamics the
4-vector current Jµ = (ρ, ρ~v) represents the macroscopic distributions of density
(charge) and 3-vector current. On the other hand, in the present approach Jµ is
rather diﬀerent since it contains dynamics of the distribution function itself as ex-
pressed in Eq. (3). This is analogous to the current in the Maxwell equation and in
the quantum-electrodynamic which is the result of fermion-pair interaction. In con-
sequency of this result, the ﬂuid current is induced by the interaction of ﬂuid ﬁeld
and its medium. Hence in the free lagrangian case or in the single and homogeneous
ﬂuid system without medium ﬁeld, i.e. Jµ = 0, we are still able to investigate the
ﬂuid dynamics. This point is completely diﬀerent with the classical approach where
the ﬂuid dynamics is always governed by its current. This supports the scenario
that we must not start from the existence of continuity equation of ﬂuid current as
mentioned before.

Finally, we summarize the results as follow. An alternative approach to con-
structing the relativistic NS equation using the lagrangian method has been ex-
(2) is well
plained. The quantum-electrodynamic-like lagrangian written in Eq.
suited for this purpose. We have shown that it can be accomplished by imposing
the relativistic kinetic energy in the scalar potential as written in Eq. (7). The rela-
tivistic NS equation also coincides with the classical NS equation at non-relativistic
limit. Using the NS lagrangian proposed here, one can further consider the inter-
action between ﬂuid and another medium in a consistent manner. For example, we
can deploy the lagrangian in Eq. (1) with V (Φ) = − 1
4!(Φ†Φ)2 to describe
the interaction of ﬂuid in a solitonic medium. Since the lagrangian leads to the
EOM in term of Φ which obeys the non-linear Klein-Gordon equation with solitonic
solutions.

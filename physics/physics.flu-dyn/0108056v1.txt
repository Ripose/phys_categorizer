Eigenfrequencies of a system containing an arbitrary number of bubbles levitated in a liquid is
discussed. Using a linear coupled-oscillator model, it is shown theoretically that when the system
contains N bubbles of diﬀerent sizes, each bubble has 2N −1 (or less) eigenfrequencies which make the
phase diﬀerence between an external sound and a bubble’s pulsation be π/2. Furthermore, we give
a discussion regarding a discrepancy appearing between the present result for the eigenfrequencies
and existing ones for the resonance frequencies in a 2-bubble case, and show that the eigenfrequency,
deﬁned as above, and the resonance frequency have a diﬀerent physical meaning when N ≥ 2, while
they are consistent for N = 1.

Multibubble dynamics in an acoustic ﬁeld has been
studied in a variety of ﬁelds [1–16], and the mutual radia-
tive interaction of bubbles is known to vary their acoustic
properties [1–7,10,11,15]. Shima [1] derived a theoretical
formula for estimating the resonance frequencies of two
mutually interacting gas bubbles levitated in an invis-
cid liquid, and showed that a bubble interacting with a
neighboring bubble has two resonance frequencies which
reveal upward or downward shift as the bubbles approach
each other. Zabolotskaya [2] showed theoretically that
the variations in the resonance frequencies may cause the
changes of phase diﬀerence between bubbles, and may,
in turn, sometime give rise to the reversal of the sign
of the secondary Bjerknes force, which is an interaction
force acting between pulsating bubbles [12]. In Ref. [3,4]
Doinikov and Zavtrak gave results, being almost equiva-
lent to those due to Zabolotskaya, by employing a math-
ematical model in which the multiple scattering between
bubbles is described using a Legendre expansion func-
tion. These results are regarded as those explaining the
“bubble grape”, which is a stable structure formed by
bubbles in an acoustic ﬁeld [4]. Feuillade [5], using a
self-consistent model, showed that when two bubbles are
pulsating in antiphase and the radiation damping is dom-
inant rather than the thermal or viscous one, the bub-
bles may show the superresonant response [6,7] because
of the reduction in the eﬀective damping. Ye and Al-
varez [8,9], using a self-consistent model, has carried out
numerical experiments of acoustic wave propagation in
a liquid containing randomly distributed identical bub-
bles, and showed that the localization of acoustic waves
can take place in a range of frequency. It was considered
that the multiple scattering of sound due to the bubbles
has a strong inﬂuence on this phenomenon. Mettin et
al. [10] and Doinikov [11] examined some inﬂuences of
the interaction of two bubbles in a strong acoustic ﬁeld
on the radiation forces (the secondary [12] and primary

[13,17] Bjerknes forces) acting on the bubbles; these stud-
ies are related to multibubble sonoluminescence [18,19].

The aim of this paper is to give a preliminary but sig-
niﬁcant discussions regarding the eigenfrequencies of a
system containing an arbitrary number of bubbles having
diﬀerent radii, by employing a simple theoretical model.
In this present study, the eigenfrequencies of a bubble
in the system is deﬁned as the frequencies of an external
sound for which the phase diﬀerence between the sound
and the bubble’s pulsation becomes π/2 [15]. This deﬁ-
nition is based on the well-known phenomenon of a sin-
gle bubble case that the phase diﬀerence between an ex-
ternal sound and the bubble pulsation becomes π/2 at
its resonance frequency (more correctly, at its natural
frequency) [16,20]. Main purpose of this paper can be
divided into two parts: (1) Examine how many eigen-
frequencies a bubble in the system has. As has been
studied, it can be considered that the phase shifts of the
bubble pulsations due to the radiation coupling give rise
to a large variety of phenomena that cannot be predicted
by a model for single bubble (see, e.g., [1–11]). However,
there exist only a few studies on the eigenfrequencies de-
ﬁned as mentioned above. Almost all of previous works
(e.g., [1–5]) are on the resonance frequencies. Very re-
cently, Ida [15], using a coupled oscillator model, showed
theoretically that a bubble interacting with a neighboring
bubble has three eigenfrequencies. In this present paper,
by extending Ida’s approach, we derive the number of the
eigenfrequencies of a bubble interacting with an arbitrary
number of bubbles. (2) Clarify a diﬀerence between the
eigenfrequency and the resonance frequency. As hinted
already, the eigenfrequency and the resonance frequency
have diﬀerent physical meanings, when the number of
bubbles, N , is larger than 1. As brieﬂy reviewed above,
Shima and Zabolotskaya predicted the existence of two
resonance frequencies per bubbles when N = 2. This
number of the resonance frequencies is not equal to that

Let us analyze the matrix equation. The solution of

of the eigenfrequencies given by Ida.
In this present
paper, we show that in general, the numbers of those
frequencies are diﬀerent. This result shows that when
N ≥ 2, the reversal of the phase of the bubble pulsa-
tion (e.g., from in-phase to out-of-phase with an external
sound) may occur not only at the resonance but also at
other frequencies, unlike in the case of N = 1.

At ﬁrst, we derive a system of linear diﬀerential equa-
tions that describes the pulsation of coupled bubbles and
is almost equivalent to those used in Refs. [1,2,5,8,9,15].
Let us assume that N bubbles are levitated in a viscous
liquid and the equilibrium radius of each bubble is Ri0
(i = 1, 2, · · · , N ). When the amplitude of the external
sound is weak, the bubble pulsation can be described by
a linear second-order diﬀerential equation [21,22,16] of

where it is assumed that the sphericity of the bubbles is
kept and the time-dependent bubble radii Ri(t) can be
represented by Ri(t) = Ri0 + ei(t) (|ei| ≪ Ri0), and ωi0
is the resonance (angular) frequency, δi is the damping
factor, pd i is the driving pressure acting on bubble i, ρ is
the density of the surrounding liquid, and the over dots
denote the derivation with respect to time. When more
than one bubbles exist, the driving pressure pd i is given
by the sum of the pressures of the external sound, pex,
and the scattered sound waves due to other bubbles, ps ij,
as

This kind of system of diﬀerential equations is called a

plex amplitudes. Those assumptions reduce Eq. (3) to

As is well known, M−1 can be written in a form of

where |M| and C are the determinant and the cofactor
matrix, respectively, of M. From the deﬁnitions of the
determinant and the cofactor of a matrix, one knows that

deg (|M(ω)|) = 2N,
deg (C(ω)) = 2(N − 1).

Here we should note that deg (mij (ω)) = 2. Substitution
of Eq. (8) into Eq. (7) yields

As deﬁned previously, the eigenfrequencies of bubble i is
derived by an equation of

A =

Re(Ai) = 0.

|M| = a + i b,

where a, b, ci and di are real values and gi is an element

Using this equation and assuming that |M| 6= 0, i.e., no
case exists where both a = 0 and b = 0 are true (this as-
sumption is physically valid because this guarantees the
absence of a singular solution), Eq. (11) is reduced to

aci + bdi = 0.

(15)

Now we examine how many roots this equation has. From
Eqs. (9) and (10) and deﬁnitions (12) and (13), we know
that

deg(aci + bdi) = 2N + 2(N − 1) = 4N − 2.

|M| = 0

(19)

in terms of this paper. This condition gives rise to the
well-known singularity in the bubble pulsation at the
resonance [23,17]. This formula is reduced to the well-
known one for a single-bubble case, ω2 − ω2
10 = 0, and to
Eq. (18) for a double-bubble case. On the other hand, in
this present study, the eigenfrequencies of bubble i in the
case of δi = 0 are derived by the following independent
equations:

Re(Ai) = Ai =

= 0

(20)

|M|

Furthermore, using deﬁnition (6), we can prove that
Eq. (15) contains only terms of even orders with respect
to ω as follows: The real parts of mij is second order
and the imaginary one is ﬁrst order with respect to ω;
thus, only terms of even orders remain in the real part
of Ai, because an even-order component given by the
imaginary parts of mij, e.g., i ωδ1 × i ωδ2 = −δ1δ2ω2,
becomes a real value and an odd-order component, e.g.,
i ωδ1 × i ωδ2 × i ωδ3 = −i δ1δ2δ3ω3, becomes an imaginary
value. As a result, Eq. (15) can be represented as

and

Equation (21) means that the phase of bubble i is re-
versed at ω satisfying this equation. Equations (20) and
(21), respectively, may be reduced to

gi = 0 and

|M| = 0

Those equations predict that a bubble has 2N − 1 (or
less) eigenfrequencies. (Note that only a positive root is
physical.) When N = 2, for example, 2N − 1 = 3; this
result is in agreement with that given by Ida [15].

We perform here a comparative study between the
present theory and readymade ones in order to clarify a
diﬀerence between the eigenfrequency and the resonance
frequency. Shima [1] and Zabolotskaya [2] derived the
same formula for estimating the resonance frequencies in
the case of N = 2, expressed as

(X − ω2

10)(X − ω2

X 2 = 0.

In their mathematical models, the sphericity of bubbles
and incompressibility of surrounding liquid were assumed
as well as in the present one, but the damping factor was
neglected. This formula predicts two resonance frequen-
cies; apparently, this result seems to contradict the result
given by Ida, which predicts three eigenfrequencies. Now
we discuss the origin of this discrepancy.

Generally, when no damping factor exists (δi = 0,
Im(mij ) = 0), the resonance frequencies are determined
by

gi |M| = 0.

(22)

Furthermore, using deﬁnitions of Eqs. (12) and (13),
Eq. (22) can be reduced to

aci = 0.

This equation is in agreement with Eq. (15) when b = 0
and di = 0 (those conditions are naturally satisﬁed be-
cause of Im(mij) = 0). The degree of Eq. (19) with
respect to X is N as discussed already, while that of
Eq. (22) is (N − 1) + N = 2N − 1. When N > 1,
those two degrees are not equal to one another. This
result reveals that (1) the “resonance frequency” and the
“eigenfrequency” have diﬀerent physical meaning, (2) the
number of the eigenfrequencies is, in general, larger than
that of the resonance frequency and (3) the conditions to
which the phase reversal of bubble pulsation takes place
exist besides those for the resonance. Those conclusions
are obtained for the ﬁrst time.

Next, we discuss the case of Dij ≈ ∞ and δi ≈ 0, i.e.,
the non-diagonal elements of M and the imaginary parts
of its diagonal elements have quite small values. Those
settings result in

This equation shows that for Dij → ∞, among 2N − 1
eigenfrequencies of bubble i, only one converges to ωi0,
and two of remaining ones converge to ωj0 (j 6= i). This
result is consistent with that for N = 2, given in Ref. [15].
Lastly, we brieﬂy discuss a special case. Here we as-
sume that all bubbles are identical (R10 = R20 = · · · =
RN 0, δ1 = δ2 = · · · = δN ) and, furthermore, the dis-
tances between all pairs of bubble are uniform. (The lat-
ter assumption may be realizable up to N = 4.) When
N = 3, this setting corresponds to the “mode A” dis-
cussed in Sec. III of Ref. [5]. With those assumptions,
the elements of matrix |M| become

m11 = m22 = · · · = mN N = R10[(ω2 − ω2

.

Only one eigenfrequency is given by this formula, al-
though 2N − 1 ones are predicted in general. This result
points out that such an excessive idealization prevents
accurate understandings of multibubble dynamics in an
acoustic ﬁeld.

In summary, we have studied the eigenfrequencies of a
system containing an arbitrary number of bubbles hav-
ing diﬀerent sizes by employing a linear coupled-oscillator
model. In this present study, when the phase diﬀerence
between an external sound and a bubble’s pulsation be-
comes π/2, the frequency of the external sound was called

the eigenfrequency. The present theory predicts that a
bubble in the system has 2N − 1 eigenfrequencies, while
it has N resonance frequencies; namely, the wall-known
theory for a one-bubble case that the phase reversal of a
bubble’s pulsation takes place around its resonance fre-
quency is not absolutely true in a two- or more-bubble
case. This result is important especially for subjects in
which the phase change of bubbles acts an important role,
such as those studied in Refs. [2–4,10,11]. We expect
that more detailed mathematical discussions regarding
the matrix equation will supply still richer understand-
ings on physics of multibubble dynamics in an acoustic
ﬁeld and acoustic wave propagation in bubbly liquid.

Dynamic Point-Formation in Dielectric Fluids

(Dated: August 13, 2013)

We use boundary-integral methods to compute the time-dependent deformation of a drop of
dielectric ﬂuid immersed in another dielectric ﬂuid in a uniform electric ﬁeld E. Steady state theory
predicts, when the permittivity ratio, β, is large enough, a conical interface can exist at two cone
angles, with θ<(β) stable and θ>(β) unstable. Our numerical evidence instead shows a dynamical
process which produces a cone-formation and a transient ﬁnite-time singularity, when E and β are
above their critical values. Based on a scaling analysis of the electric stress and the ﬂuid motion,
we are able to apply approximate boundary conditions to compute the evolution of the tip region.
We ﬁnd in our non-equilibrium case where the electric stress is substantially larger than the surface
tension, the ratio of the electric stress to the surface tension in the newly-grown cone region can
converge to a β dependent value, αc(β) > 1, while the cone angle converges to θ<(β). This new
dynamical solution is self-similar.

The formation of conical ends on ﬂuid-ﬂuid inter-
faces in strong electric/magnetic ﬁelds has been seen
in various electrospraying and ferroﬂuid experiments
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Building on the work of Taylor [2], Li
et al. and Ramos & Castellanos studied the electrostat-
ics of an inﬁnite cone with semi-vertical angle θ0 formed
between two dielectric ﬂuids with permittivity ratio β.
In spherical coordinates, the electric stress σe ∼ r2(ν−1).
In an equilibrium cone, this stress must be balanced by
the surface tension, so that ν must be 1/2. According to
their analysis [7, 8], there are two such solutions of θ0,
θ<(β) and θ>(β), which will occur for β > βc = 17.59.
The former is said to be stable, the latter unstable [7].

In contrast, this letter describes a dynamical ﬁxed
point in which a cone is formed transiently. At the ﬁxed
point, the cone angle is θ<(β) so that surface stress and
electric stress have the same scaling in the cone, with the
ratio of the two being constant, but diﬀerent from unity.
The electric stress is the larger of the two, so that the
total surface stress always acts to elongate the pointed
region.

We compute the time-dependent deformation of a di-
electric drop (ﬂuid 1) freely suspended in another dielec-
tric ﬂuid (ﬂuid 2) in a uniform electric ﬁeld. Both ﬂuids
are incompressible and have the same viscosity η. There

is surface tension with coeﬃcient γ between the two ﬂu-
ids. The drop is axially symmetric and has round tips,
with its shape represented by the radius function h(z) in
cylindrical coordinates (r, z). r∗ denotes the radius of
curvature at the tip. An electric ﬁeld with strength E
is applied in the z direction (Fig. 1). Suppose the ini-
tial radius of the drop is a. Respectively we use a, γ/η,

Following Sherwood [9], we study a situation in which
Reynolds number is small so that the ﬂuid ﬂows via
Stokes equation and the charge distributions are deter-
mined by electrostatics. The surface charge density ρ can
be expressed in the form of a boundary integral equation

the surface charge density ρ, the normal and tangential
component of the electric ﬁeld can be calculated to ob-
tain the jump in the electric stress across the interface.

points in proportion to the local curvature, and use a
cubic spline to interpolate the interface between mesh
points, a quartic polynomial to interpolate the surface
charge density. The derived linear algebraic equations
are solved by LU decomposition. A fourth-order Runge-
Kutta scheme is applied to update the interface position.
There exists a critical electric ﬁeld Ec(β) for β > βc.
When E < Ec, the drop can reach equilibrium with
round tips. We start our simulation from a sphere and
apply a suﬃciently small electric ﬁeld. If the maximum
velocity on the interface decreases to a value below 10−4
following an exponential decay, we consider that the drop
will reach equilibrium. After equilibrium is reached by a
numerical extrapolation, the ﬁeld is increased by a small
amount. Through increasing the electric ﬁeld step by
step we ﬁnd the critical electric ﬁeld.

When E > Ec, a ﬁnite time singularity develops. From
now on, we use β = 18.5 as our example, which has E2
c =
0.4085 ± 0.0003. For instance, when we choose the initial
shape to be the equilibrium shape at E2 = 0.400 < E2
c

2

and suddenly apply E2 = 0.410 > E2
c , the drop forms
conical-like ends. The velocity at the tip dramatically
increases as a critical time is approached (Fig. 2). Here
we can at most obtain about twelve decades of data in
one calculation, due to the increasing number of mesh
points required and roundoﬀ error.

Figure 3 shows how the shape and stresses evolve as
the ﬁnite time singularity develops. The slope plot sug-
gests we can partition the interface into three regions, the
tip region, the conical-like region and the macroscopic re-
gion. The conical-like region is the intermediate region
with a small variation in the slope. Figure 3(A) shows
as r∗ decreases, the macroscopic region and the estab-
lished part of the cone region almost remain intact, while
part of the interface which used to be in the tip region
now grows conical-like. This shows that in the course of
r∗ → 0, only the tip region changes in time, while the es-
tablished part of the cone region nearly remains indepen-
dent of time. A careful examination of Fig. 3(A) shows
the conical-like region is not exactly a cone, because the
slope of the newly-grown cone changes as r∗ decreases.
As we shall see in more detail later, this slope approaches
the value set by θ<. Figure 3(B) shows the ratio of the
electric stress to the surface tension is larger than one
in the tip region and the conical-like region. The stress
ratio also does not change in the part of interface whose
shape remains as the conical-like region expands. Hence
the numerical evidence says that the shape of each part
of the almost conical region and the stress ratio within
that part remain frozen as the tip gets smaller. How-
ever, as r∗ changes the slope and the stress ratio of the
newly-grown part change too. So Figure 2 and 3 may
show an approach to a ﬁxed point, but they do not show
a ﬁxed behavior themselves. Because there is a slow and
not-quite uniform convergence to a ﬁxed point, it is hard
to estimate the critical time, tc, from our raw data. For
this reason, we shall henceforth plot our results against
tip radius, r∗ instead of trying to use tc − t.

A scaling study, sometimes called an order of magni-
tude analysis, enables us to estimate the sizes of diﬀerent
contributions, it indicates how the diﬀerent regions aﬀect
one another.

These estimates show that except for a uniform advec-
tion, the stresses in the tip region determines the ﬂow
within that region and the subsequent shape of the tip.
Speciﬁcally, the deformation of the tip region is domi-
nantly caused by the local stress jump. The axial strain
rate deﬁned as ∂uz(x)/∂x measures how fast the inter-
face deforms due to the axial velocity. Using (2), we can
express the contribution to ∂uz(x)/∂x from the three re-
gions. Respectively the tip region, the conical region and
the macroscopic region have length scales r∗, h(z) and
1 (r∗ ≪ h(z) ≪ 1). The electric stresses in the three

regions have an order of magnitude

with 0 < ν < 1. A similar result applies to the surface
tension σs, but with ν = 1/2. An argument like that of
Lister and Stone shows that the forces in the intermedi-
ate and macroscopic region simply advect the tip region
without signiﬁcant contribution to the strain rate [11].

A followup study [12] will describe in more detail how
the scaling analysis of the electric stress works. For the
present purposes, it suﬃces to say that the shape in the
tip region mostly determines the electric stress within
that region, except for a coeﬃcient which only depends
on the shape in the other regions and the applied electric
ﬁeld.
If we change the shape in the other regions, the
electric stress in the entire tip region will be changed by a
factor which is independent of the shape in the tip region.
Changing the applied electric ﬁeld will have the same
eﬀect. So after we reshape the rest part of the interface,
we can restore the electric stress in the tip region by
applying a diﬀerent electric ﬁeld of certain strength.

The scaling study permits us to construct approximate
boundary conditions which then permits the accurate de-
termination of the subsequent behavior of the tip. Basi-
cally whenever we are about to run out of mesh points,
we cut oﬀ the part of interface far away from the tip and
replace it by a new shape proﬁle which takes fewer mesh
points. Then we restore the electric stress in the entire
tip region, which we can accomplish by adjusting the ap-
plied electric ﬁeld to restore the electric stress at the tip
to its value prior to the truncation. The tip regions of
the prescribed new drop and the original drop will subse-
quently evolve in the same way, because the deformation
of the tip region is primarily driven by the local stress
jump. We deﬁne the rescaled axial distance ξ and radius
function H(ξ) as

ξ = (z − ztip)/r

∗

,

H(ξ) = h(z)/r

∗

.

(4)

We at least keep the part of interface with ξ ≤ 104 and
typically match a spherical band to the center region,
requiring the slope to be continuous at the truncation
points. The center of the spherical band, which locates
on the z axis, coincides with the center of the prescribed
new drop. The error will be smaller if the truncation
point is farther away from the tip. The “truncate and
prescribe” idea was invented by Zhang and Lister [13].

Using the same initial condition as in Fig. 2, we calcu-
late the evolution of the tip region for eighty decades of r∗
with approximate boundary conditions. We truncate the
drop for twenty-four times, starting at r∗ = 10−8. Figure
4 shows that the approximate boundary condition pro-
duces the same result as the exact boundary condition
without truncation at 10−12 ≤ r∗ ≤ 10−8. The point

iting values as r∗ → 0. Just below we shall show those
limits are the same for diﬀerent initial conditions.

′

Further simulations show there exists a ﬁxed point be-
havior: the stress ratio of the newly-grown cone con-
verges to a ﬁxed value larger than unity. At β = 18.5,
α(ξ = 100) will converge to 1.130 as r∗ → 0, if it is
close to 1 when the drop starts to develop conical ends,
regardless of the initial shapes. For example in Fig.
5, simulation (ii) in solid lines and simulation (iii) in
dashed lines have diﬀerent initial conditions. The dot-
ted lines and dashed lines can all be excellently ﬁtted by
c + b(r∗)p. As r∗ → 0, the two simulations give the same
limits H
(ξ = 100)c = 0.4726, α(ξ = 100)c = 1.130 and
(dr∗/dt)c = −0.0198. As you may notice, we have ob-
tained the same limits in the simulation in Fig. 4. The
ﬁtted values of the power are very close to each other in
all the simulations, and we get p = 0.013 ± 0.001.
In
simulation (i), we purposely choose a particular initial
condition to let α(ξ = 100) equal to α(ξ = 100)c at an
early stage in the cone formation. We see that α(ξ = 100)
stably stays at α(ξ = 100)c for many decades of r∗ with
(ξ = 100) and dr∗/dt equal to the limits obtained
H
from the curve ﬁtting. We have concrete numerical ev-
idence that α(ξ = 100)c = 1.130 is a stable ﬁxed point
at β = 18.5. This ﬁxed point is ﬁnally approached in a
power law of r∗. And simulation (i) gives the solution at
this ﬁxed point.

′

At this ﬁxed point, the tip region is self-similar and the
intermediate region is a cone with the cone angle θ<(β).
The ﬁrst twelve decades of data calculated with the exact
boundary condition in simulation (i) reveal the solution

4

at this ﬁxed point. We ﬁnd the following properties: (a)
The shape proﬁles of the tip region are self-similar af-
ter we rescale them by r∗, for example H(ξ) at ξ = 10
is a constant for small r∗ [Fig. 6(A)]. (b) The ever ex-
panding intermediate region has a constant slope equal
to T an θ<(β) [Fig. 6(B)]. (c) The velocity at the tip in-
creases logarithmically [Fig. 6(C)]. (d) The stress ratio in
the intermediate region is a constant substantially larger
than one, which we call it αc [Fig. 6(D)]. The values
of αc and α(ξ = 100)c are very close to each other. (e)
dr∗/dt is a constant [Fig. 5(C)], which indicates that r∗
scales like tc − t. This self-similar solution has some qual-
itative similarity with a scaling solution found by Lister
and Stone [11].

We ﬁnd similar ﬁxed points at other values of β >
βc such as 19.0. To summarize, our numerical evidence
shows a cone with the smaller cone angle θ<(β) can be
formed transiently in a non-equilibrium case where the
electric stress is not balanced by the surface tension. The
angle is approached as the stress ratio in the newly-grown
cone region converges to a ﬁxed value αc(β) > 1. The
dynamical solution at this ﬁxed point is self-similar.

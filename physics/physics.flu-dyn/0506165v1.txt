New Stabilization of the Burnett Equations when
Entropy Change to Kn0 Vanishes

Abstract

We assume that to zero order in the Knudsen number the deviation
of the entropy from a background value vansishes. We then show that
adding a super-Burnett term we obtain a stable state of rest. The resulting
equations have the same form as the Burnett equations but with the value
of some coeﬃcients changed. In particular the result applies to nonlinear
acoustics.

We consider a slightly rareﬁed gas. To ﬁrst order in the Knudsen number,
Kn, the Navier-Stokes equations are valid. Burnett [1] derived the corresponding
equations to second order in Kn. Bobylev [2] showed that the state of rest is
unstable for the Burnett equations, see also Uribe et al. [3]. In this contribution
we make the assumption that the deviation of entropy from a background value
is of the order of KnMa, where Ma, is the Mach number. This is the case for
nonlinear acoustics, where Ma ∼ Kn. We show that with an error Kn3 the
Burnett equations in this case can be replace by equations which are linearly
stable.

In the one-dimensional case, the Burnett expressions for the xx component
of the pressure tensor P and the heat current q are, see Chapman & Cowling
[4] (the dots indicate nonlinear Burnett terms)

f = 2mκ/3kBµ is the Eucken number.
In the calculations we use the value
f = 5/2. This is the lowest approximation in terms of Sonine polynomial
expansion for any interatomic potential and is experimentally found to be a
good approximation, see [4].

Now we assume that the entropy change is of 0(KnMa). We then have

(γ = cp/cv). Linearizing and using dimensionless units we ﬁnd

(γ − 1)ρxxx − Txxx = 0(KnMa).

Hence, to within terms 0(Kn) we have for any value α which is 0(1)

ω2ρxxx + (ω2 − ω3)Txxx = [ω2 + α(γ − 1)]ρxxx +

(ω2 − ω3 − α)Txxx + 0(KnMa).

Thus, we can change the values of ω2, ω3 to ˘ω2 och ˘ω3 in the linear part of the
Burnett contribution.

˘ω2 = ω2 + α(γ − 1),
˘ω3 = ω3 + αγ.

Let us now choose α so that the coeﬃcient of ρxxx vanishes, or ˘ω2 = 0, This

gives for a monatomic gas

As a consequence, the ρxxx term disappears. The sign of the Txxx term changes.

For solutions proportional to exp[ikx + Λt] we ﬁnd

Clearly, there is one mode that is nonpropagating and damped and there are two
propagating, damped modes. One entropy mode and two sound wave modes.
It is really not necessary to have ˇω2 = 0, but just to have ˇω2 − ˇω3 > 0.

Let us write down the resulting equations, ﬁrst in the one-dimensional case.

We neglect the nonlinear Burnett terms.

Here, the coeﬃcients of the Burnett terms can be taken at the background
value, but the variations of µ, κ in the Navier-Stokes terms have to be taken
inte account.

We now give the phase velocity. Note that the phase velocity is constant plus
a term to order Kn2. Hence the deviation from straight lines for the Navier-
Stokes equations is not physically relevant but that the deviation for the Burnett
equations (and our equations) is. Note that the diﬀerence between the Burnett
equations and our equations is for larger k than those shown in Fig. 2.

In earlier contributions by Jin and Slemrod, [5] and by the present author
[6],see also [8] and [7] the Burnett equations were regularized to a set of 13 ﬁrst
order equations generally valid.

The present regularization applies when the deviations of entropy is 0(KnMa)
but gives equations which can more easily be applied for small Knudsen num-
bers. The condition on the entropy applies for nonlinear sound propagation.
The same assumption that Ma ∼ Kn is called the weakly nonlinear case in Sone

[9], where stationarity is assumed, but here sound waves are included as well.

Recently, the present author has also obtained another set of regularized
equations [10], which like the Burnett equations and the equations in this work
are equations for ρ, v, T . They are, however generally valid, with no limitation
on entropy or Mach number. They are ﬁrst order in time and third order in
space, but also contain mixed derivatives ﬁrst order in time and up to second
order in space.

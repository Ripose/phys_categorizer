Abstract. We derive a new shell model of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
in which the energy transfers are not necessary local. Like the original MHD equations,
the model conserves the total energy, magnetic helicity, cross-helicity and volume in
phase space (Liouville’s theorem) apart from the eﬀects of external forcing, viscous
dissipation and magnetic diﬀusion.
In the absence of magnetic ﬁeld the model
exhibits a statistically stationary kinetic energy solution with a Kolmogorov spectrum.
The dynamo action from a seed magnetic ﬁeld by the turbulent ﬂow and the non
linear interactions are studied for a wide range of magnetic Prandtl numbers in both
kinematic and dynamic cases. The non locality of the energy transfers are clearly
identiﬁed.

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

2

1. Introduction

Pioneering shell models of hydrodynamic turbulence were developed in the seventies
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], aiming at reproducing the main turbulence features, as intermittency,
with a low order model of equations.
Such shell models were also called wave
packet representation [6] for the Fourier space is logarithmically divided into shells
of logarithmic width λ such that each wave packet (or shell) kn is deﬁned by k0λn−1 <
k ≤ k0λn. Those models are local in the sense that each shell interacts with only
the ﬁrst neighbours like the DN model (named after Desnyansky and Novikov [4]),
or the two ﬁrst neighbours like the GOY model (named after Gledzer, Ohkitani and
Yamada [3, 7]). The latter has been intensively studied (for a review, see [8, 9, 10, 11]
and references therein) and subjected to improvements leading to the so-called Sabra
model [12, 13, 14] or extensions using the wavelet decomposition [15]. The GOY and
subsequently Sabra models have been used in diﬀerent contexts like convection [16],
rotation [17] or intermittency [18, 19]. It has been shown [20] that the DN model is
a spectral reduction of the GOY model, showing in some sense the consistency of one
model against the other.

To our knowledge only one non-local shell model of turbulence has been developed
so far, by Zimin and Hussain [21], projecting the Navier-Stokes equations onto a wavelet
basis, and reducing the number of variables from statistical assumptions. In such non-
local model each shell may interact with any other shell. Since then, the original model
has been improved by Zimin in order to include left- or right-handed polarity of the
solenoidal basis functions as in the complex helical wave decomposition, and used by
Melander and Fabijonas [22, 23, 24].

The extension of shell models to MHD turbulence has been done including
either ﬁrst neighbours interactions [25, 26, 27, 28] or two ﬁrst neighbours interactions
[29, 30, 31, 32, 33] eventually including Hall eﬀect [34, 35]. However there is a number
of situations in MHD turbulence in which assuming the locality of energy transfers may
become somewhat spurious even if the turbulence is considered as isotropic [33]. This
is true for example when a large scale external magnetic ﬁeld is imposed leading to
Alfven waves [36, 37, 38]. This problem has been tackled using a MHD shell model
implementing non local interactions with the externally imposed magnetic ﬁeld scale
[28]. However it has been shown recently using an other method [39] that the other
non local interactions are also important and may rule out the predicted Iroshnikov-
Kraichnan k−3/2 spectrum. Non local interactions are also at the heart of the dynamo
problem i.e. when the magnetic ﬁeld is produced by the turbulent motion instead of
being externally applied. For example at large value of the magnetic Prandtl number,
the magnetic spectrum is observed to peak at scales much smaller than the viscous scale
[40, 41, 42] showing a direct evidence of the importance of non local energy transfers. In
presence of helicity, two possible mechanisms may generate a large scale magnetic ﬁeld
as observed in planets and stars: either a local inverse cascade [43] or a non local direct
transfer from small to large scales as predicted by the mean-ﬁeld theory [44]. Which

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

mechanism prevails is still not clear. Recently, the importance of non-local interactions
has been shown in both hydrodynamic [45] and MHD [46, 47, 48] turbulence. For recent
reviews on MHD turbulence and the dynamo problem, see e.g. [49, 50]

In the present paper our aim is to introduce a new non local shell model of
turbulence which can be used either in its hydrodynamic or MHD form. As we
are interested by MHD applications, we shall introduce the MHD model only, the
hydrodynamic one being easily deduced from the former, setting the magnetic ﬁeld
to zero. Our model can be understood as a non local version of the Sabra model. This
involves similar rules for complex conjugations and imposes the value of shell spacing
equal to the golden number. Our ﬁrst attempt to derive a non local shell model of MHD
turbulence was based on the Zimin model [21]. However we realized that this model was
unable to describe the non local interaction between a large scale velocity and two small
neighboring scales of the magnetic ﬁeld. We believe that the one which is described here
is more relevant to actual isotropic MHD turbulence.

2. General concept

2.1. The model

(1)

(3)

The model is deﬁned by the following set of equations

˙Un = ikn [Qn(U, U, a) + Qn(B, B, −a)] − νk2
˙Bn = ikn [Qn(U, B, b) + Qn(B, U, −b)] − ηk2

represents the non linear transfer rates. The parameters ν and η are respectively the
kinematic viscosity and the magnetic diﬀusivity, Fn is the forcing of turbulence, and
kn = λn with λ2 = λ + 1 [12]. For N = 1 in (3), we recognize the local Sabra model.
The additional non local interactions for N ≥ 2 correspond to all other possible triad
interactions except the ones involving two identical scales. Expressions for the kinetic
energy EU and helicity HU , magnetic energy EB and helicity HB, and cross helicity HC
are given by

EU =

In the case of pure hydrodynamic turbulence (without magnetic ﬁeld), the coeﬃcients
m are derived from the kinetic energy and helicity conservations ( ˙EU = ˙HU = 0),
ai
leading again to the same expression as (7). The coeﬃcients Tm are free parameters
depending on m only, that we choose of the form Tm = kα
m−1/λ(λ + 1). The coeﬃcient
1/λ(λ + 1) is chosen such that the terms for m = 1 in Qn correspond to the local Sabra
model. The local Sabra model corresponds to α = −∞.

2.2. All possible interactions

In our shell model we see from (3) that only a discrete number of triads are allowed.
For example, Qn does not contain any term involving interactions between the modes
n + m and n + m + 2. The reason why there is only a discrete number of allowed triads
comes from the fact that the shells are logarithmically spaced and that the geometrical
factor λ satisﬁes

To identify all the allowed triads in a shell model, let us consider three vectors (k1, k2, k3)
satisfying

λ2 ≥ λ + 1.

k1 + k2 + k3 = 0.

Assuming that k1 and k2 belong to shell n and p, we have
k0λp−1 < |k2| ≤ k0λp.

k0λn−1 < |k1| ≤ k0λn,

From (9), this implies

k0|λn−1 − λp−1| ≤ |k3| ≤ k0(λn + λp).

Now using the inequalities (8) and (11) we can show that k3 belongs to shell q which
depends on p in the following way:

p ≤ n − 3 ⇒ n − 1 ≤ q ≤ n + 1
p = n − 2 ⇒ n − 2 ≤ q ≤ n + 1
q ≤ n + 1
p = n − 1 ⇒
q ≤ n + 2.
⇒
p = n

q ≤ n + 2
p = n + 1 ⇒
n ≤ q ≤ n + 3
p = n + 2 ⇒
p ≥ n + 3 ⇒ p − 1 ≤ q ≤ p + 1

(12)

This is illustrated in Figure 1 in the plane (p, q) where the grey (resp. white) squares
indicate allowed (resp. not allowed) triads (n, p, q). The demonstration of (12) is given
in Appendix Appendix A. In Figure 1, the terms corresponding to the original Sabra
local model are denoted by “L”, the additional non local terms by “N” and the terms of
Zimin’s model by “Z”. In every case the possible shells (p, q) are symmetric with respect
to the diagonal in the (p, q) plane .

and q. The white squares correspond to a null probability.

2.3. Evaluation of α

There is one free parameter left, α, which corresponds to the non locality strength. It is
not an easy task (if possible at all) to ﬁgure out what α should be in the general case.
However we tried to estimate it in the case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (without
magnetic ﬁeld). For that, we take two random vectors k1 from shell n, and k2 uniformly
distributed in whole space, and we calculate the probability that k3 = −(k1 + k2) and
k2 belong respectively to shells p and q. It is the simplest estimate of the probability
that the three modes k1, k2 and k3 interact together. A high (resp. low) value of this
probability is given in Figure 1 by the dark (resp.
light) colour of the grey squares.
In this representation a white square correspond to a null probability. The probability
spectra along the p and q directions are found to scale as k−7/2 for the ”L” and ”N” terms
and k−5/2 for the ”Z” terms (which is consistent with the Zimin’s model [21]). In order
to have terms Tmc2
m , we have to take α = −7/2. We
note that this derivation of α does not imply the terms Tmc1
m (and neither the diagonal
terms of Figure 1). The latters are determined a posteriori from the conservation laws
(not included in the probability diagram of Figure 1).
In section 3.1.1 we shall ﬁnd that the value α = −5/2 is the most appropriate to describe
accurately the large scale slope of the kinetic energy spectrum. However, in the rest of
the paper we shall vary the value of α in order to investigate the role of α in the non
local interactions.

2.4. Energy transfers

To study the non local interactions, we introduce the transfer rate TXY (q, n) from X-
energy lying in shell q to Y -energy lying in shell n. It can operate only within triads,
implying an additional energy Z lying in all other shells p diﬀerent from q and n.
Denoting T (Xq|Zp|Yn) the transfer rate from Xq to Yn and which involves Zp as a

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

mediator, the transfer rate from Xq to Yn can then be written as

TXY (q, n) =

T (Xq|Zp|Yn).

(13)

From our model (3) we see that for each couple (Xq, Yn), only a discrete number of Zp
can act as mediators. The possible triads are represented schematically in Figure 2.
Therefore TXY (q, n) takes the following form

with repeated subscripts (q = p, p = n or q = n) are forbidden in our model.

TXY (q, n) =

.

(14)

Now, we have to deﬁne T (Xq|Zp|Yn) for any Xq, Zp and Yn. For that, we can re-write
the model (1) (2) in the following generic form

˙Yn =

X
p,q

iknMn(Xq, Zp) + · · ·

where Mn(Xq, Zp) is a symmetric bilinear form (given in Appendix Appendix B)
representing the quadratic terms. The dots represent the dissipation and forcing terms
appropriate to Yn.

Now let us denote by S(Xq, Zp|Yn) the rate of energy within the triads (Xq, Zp, Yn)

which is transferred from the couple (Xq, Zp) to Yn. It is naturally deﬁned by

S(Xq, Zp|Yn) = ℜ {iknY ∗

n Mn(Xq, Zp)} .

As Mn is symmetric, we have

S(Xq, Zp|Yn) = S(Zp, Xq|Yn).

In addition,and with the help of (7), we can show that for any triad (Xq, Zp, Yn) the
following relation is satisﬁed

S(Xq, Zp|Yn) + S(Zp, Yn|Xq) + S(Yn, Xq|Zp) = 0,

meaning that the energy is conserved within each triad.

Then we look for T (Xq|Zp|Yn) as a linear combination of S(Xq, Zp|Yn), S(Yn, Xq|Zp)
and S(Zp, Yn|Xq). As in real MHD turbulence, T (Xq|Zp|Yn) must satisfy the following

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

conditions

T (Xq|Zp|Yn) = − T (Yn|Zp|Xq)
S(Xq, Zp|Yn) = T (Xq|Zp|Yn) + T (Zp|Xq|Yn).

The ﬁrst condition (19) means that the transfer rate from Xq to Yn and from Yn to Xq
with the same mediator Zp are of equal intensity but opposite signs. We note that this
implies

TXY (q, n) = −TY X(n, q).

The second condition (20) means that in any triad (Xq, Zp, Yn) the transfer rate from
(Xq, Zp) to Yn is equal to the sum of the transfer rates from Xq to Yn via Zp and from
Zp to Yn via Xq. Then combining (17),(18), (19) and (20) we end up with the following
expression for T

Furthermore we can show that the following energy balances at scale n are satisﬁed

T (Xq|Zp|Yn) =

[S(Xq, Zp|Yn) − S(Yn, Zp|Xq)]

(31)

In order to investigate the importance of non local versus local interactions, we
deﬁne the local part of the ﬂuxes given by (27) in which only the local energy transfer
rates TXY (n ± 2|n ± 1|n), TXY (n ± 1|n ∓ 1|n) and TXY (n ± 1|n ± 2|n) are involved. These
ﬂuxes correspond to those of the MHD version of the original (local) Sabra model, taking
N = 1 in (3). The non local parts of the ﬂuxes are deﬁned as the total ﬂuxes minus
their local parts.

2.6. Hydrodynamic forcing

The hydrodynamic forcing is generally applied at scale nf and nf +1 with nf = 4. It
is of the form Fn = An expiφn(t) where φn(t) ∈ [0, 2π] is constant during time intervals
tc, the constant value changing randomly from one time interval to the next one. In
this way we obtain a statistically constant injection rate equal to ǫ = A2
ntc. We chose
tc = 10−2 for it is smaller than the turn-over time at the injection scale and larger than
the viscous characteristic time.

it reaches some statistically stationary state.

For some arbitrary initial conditions on Un of small

intensity we let the
hydrodynamic evolve until
Then
introducing at a given time some small intensity of Bn we solve the full problem until a
statistically stationary MHD state is reached. The time of integration needed to obtain
good statistics depends on ν and η but is typically of several hundreds of time unit (of
the largest scale n = 0). We deﬁne the magnetic Prandtl number as the ratio Pm = ν/η.
To study the free decaying turbulence, after having reached a statistically stationary

state, the forcing is set to zero.

3. Results

3.1. Energy spectra

3.1.1. Free decaying turbulence In this section we study free decaying turbulence
without and with magnetic ﬁeld. The results are presented in Figure 3 for ν = 10−6,
diﬀerent values of α and Pm. The kinetic (magnetic) spectra are plotted with grey (red)
dots at diﬀerent times. The initial conditions are such that the cross-helicity is close
to zero at any scale. Trying the same simulation but with an initial condition with a
cross-helicity equal to 1 leads to inertial ranges poorly deﬁned. The time sample at
which the spectra are plotted is t = 1, 2, 10, 100, 200. The dots corresponding to t = 200
are the darkest and the smallest.

We observe that changing α does not change the slope of the inertial range for both
kinetic and magnetic spectra. This slope compares well with the Kolmogorov slope
(k−5/3 in spectral space) which is represented by the straight line with negative
k−2/3

slope in each plot. In the other hand, changing α changes drastically the slope at large
scale. The kinetic and magnetic energy slopes are indicated by the two straight lines
with positive slopes in each plot.

In table 3.1.1 these slopes are indicated for both spectra and for the diﬀerent values
n (k6 in

of α that are considered. From hydrodynamic turbulence theory, a slope in k5

is α = −5/2. The slope for the local Sabra model, corresponding here to α = −∞,
n (k9 in spectral space) much larger than the one predicted by the
leads to a slope in k10
theory. This is a ﬁrst drastic diﬀerence between the local and non local models which
emphasizes the importance of including the non local interactions.

We note that there is always a diﬀerence of 2 between the magnetic and kinetic
slopes, leading to a magnetic spectrum slope in k7
n (k8 in spectral space) for α = −5/2.
Though α = −5/2 seems to be the most appropriate for hydrodynamic and MHD
turbulence, in the rest of the paper we shall investigate other values of α as well, in
order to investigate the role of α in non local transfers.

3.1.2. Forced turbulence
In forced turbulence we consider shells larger than 0 (kn ≥ 1).
We could also have considered a cut-oﬀ at any other arbitrary negative shells. However,
in order to reach a stationary state it is important to have a cut oﬀ scale above which the
system is not solved (like some integral scale or the scale of the box in an experiment).
Considering negative shells without limit would imply energy to ﬁll all shells on a time
scale of the order k−1

n and without reaching a stationary state.

In Figure 4 both kinetic and magnetic energy spectra are plotted for three values
of Pm and both kinematic and saturated dynamo regimes. In each plot, the curves cor-
respond to diﬀerent values of α. In the kinematic regime (top plots) the Lorentz forces
corresponding to the term Qn(B, B, −a) are small and can be neglected in the energy
balance. Then the magnetic energy grows exponentially at any scale. In Figure 4 the
magnetic spectra are normalized by the maximum value of EB(n).
In the saturated
regime (bottom plots), the Lorentz forces act back onto the ﬂow, leading to statistically
stationary kinetic and magnetic energies.

In both kinematic and dynamic regimes and for Pm ≤ 1 (left and middle plots of
Figure 4), the eﬀect of α is not really signiﬁcant. The kinetic spectra (black curves) are
almost not sensitive to non local interactions showing that hydrodynamic interactions

are mostly local as predicted by the Kolmogorov cascade. Besides the kinetic spectra
always scale as k−2/3
(k−5/3 in the spectral space) in the inertial range. We see some
non local eﬀects onto the magnetic spectra (colour curves) which spread towards large
scales or even small scales for Pm = 10−3. However, the scale for which the spectrum is
maximum does not change and is roughly equal to kη ≈ kνP 3/4
m as again predicted by
Kolmogorov arguments (see e.g. [33]).

In the other hand, the non local eﬀect are much more signiﬁcant for Pm > 1 (plots
on the right), mainly for the magnetic spectra at scales smaller than the viscous scales
(kn ≥ kν) and for α > −1.
In the kinematic regime the maximum of the magnetic
energy spectrum occurs at scales smaller than kνP 3/4
m when α > −1. In the dynamic
regime some magnetic bottle neck appears. To understand why it is so, let us ﬁrst recall
that the ﬂow scale which produces magnetic ﬁeld in the most eﬃcient way is the one
for which the shear is the largest [33].
In the inertial range the ﬂow shear scales as
knun ∝ k2/3
n , and it is then maximum for kn ≈ kν. Therefore the non local interactions
relevant for the magnetic spectrum extension towards smaller scales are mostly those
involving Uν. The non local terms involving Uν and generating magnetic energy EB(n)
with n ≫ ν involves also Bn±1. The corresponding non local term in (2) are in the
n−ν−1U ∗
form kn(Tn−νb2
. Therefore we
understand that for α + 1 > 0 the non local eﬀect may be strong at small scales.

Figure 4. Spectra of kinetic (black curves) and magnetic (colour curves) energy
for three values of Pm (from left to right Pm = 10−3; 1; 105) and several values of
α (indicated by the labels). The spectra on top (resp. bottom) correspond to the
kinematic (resp. dynamic) regime.

3.2. Energy ﬂuxes

In this section we set α = −5/2 and ν = 10−8 and consider the dynamo saturated
regime for three values of Pm = 10−3, 1 and 104. The kinetic and magnetic spectra

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

are plotted in the top row of ﬁgure 5. Both spectra have inertial ranges of Kolmogorov
types, scaling in k−2/3
(scaling in k−5/3 in the spectral space). For Pm = 10−3 we identify
clearly that the magnetic dissipation scale is much smaller than the viscous dissipation
scale. However the distinction between them is not so clear for Pm = 104.

The total and non local part of the ﬂuxes are plotted in middle and bottom rows of
ﬁgure 5. The non local part of ΠU U (n) is found to be always much smaller than ΠU U (n),
implying that the energy transfers are mainly local. In the other hand, the importance
of the non local part of ΠBU (n) versus the local one depends on Pm.

In ﬁgure 6 the ratio ΠN onLocal

BU (n) is plotted for the three values of Pm.
For Pm = 10−3 this ratio is about 20 %. For Pm = 1 and for scales smaller than the
viscous scale kν ≈ 106, this ratio increases up to 50%. Finally, for Pm = 104 there is
a discontinuity at kν, the ratio being then equal to -100% at smaller scales. These are
ﬁrst evidences of non local interactions.

3.3. Energy transfers

The four energy transfers are plotted in Appendix Appendix C in ﬁgures C1, C2 and
C3 for respectively Pm = 10−3, 1 and 105. In each ﬁgure the column from left to right
corresponds to α = −∞, −5/2, −3/2, −1 and −1/2. The row from second to bottom
corresponds to the transfer TU U (q, n), TBU (q, n), TU B(q, n) and TBB(q, n). The trans-
fers are plotted versus log10 q, for three values of n which are indicated by the dashed
vertical lines on the spectra plots on top row and by the red, green or blue dots. The
transfers being time-dependent we plot their time-average with error bars corresponding
to the standard deviation of the mean. This gives some estimation of the robustness
of the results. Some quantities are much more noisy than the others and then less re-
liable. The local transfers seem to be always dominant whatever the values of Pm or
α. However there are also some evidence of non local transfers which are discussed below.

In ﬁgure 7 some typical results are presented for the three values of Pm = 10−3, 1
and 105 (from left to right column), each row from top to bottom corresponding to the
transfers TU U (q, n), TBU (q, n), TU B(q, n) and TBB(q, n) for one given value of n denoted
by the black dot. The curves correspond to α = −∞ (green), −5/2 (magenta), −3/2
(blue) and −1 (red).

• For Pm = 10−3, |TU U | ≫ |TBU |, implying that the dominant energy transfer which

feeds the kinetic energy is a local direct cascade of kinetic energy.

• For Pm = 1 and Pm = 105, |TU U | ≪ |TBU | implying that the kinetic energy is
mainly obtained from magnetic ﬁeld. This transfer TBU is found to be mainly local.

• For Pm = 10−3 we ﬁnd that TBU is mainly local and always negative. It means
that energy is transferred locally from Un to Bn (which is consistent with the curve
TU B just below). In addition, we see that the curve of TBU extends towards larger
and larger scales when α goes to zero. Though it is small (up to 20%), it is a

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

14

clear evidence of non local transfer from small scale kinetic to large scale magnetic
energy. We interpret it as an alpha-eﬀect in the sense of mean ﬁeld theory.

• The curves of TU B for Pm = 105 show also clear evidence of non local transfers. In
this case, Bn is fed by scales of U much larger than n. There is also some local
transfer back from Bn to Un shown by the curves of TBU .

• For Pm = 10−3 and though much smaller than TU B, there is clear evidence of non

local direct cascade of magnetic energy as shown by TBB.

• Finally, for Pm = 1 and Pm = 105, TBB shows evidence of some kind of non local

inverse cascade though much smaller than TU B.

In ﬁgures D1, D2 and D3 of Appendix Appendix D we give some qualitative illustration
of the previous interpretation of the results.

4. Discussion

leading to α = −7/2. However,

The main originality of the shell model presented in (2)(3) is that it takes into account
all possible non local interactions between diﬀerent shells. In essence it is a non local
MHD version of the Sabra model. Deriving the model we ﬁnd that there is one free
parameter that we call α (and which is diﬀerent from the alpha-eﬀect of the mean-ﬁeld
dynamo theory). In some sense this parameter controls the strength of non locality of
the model. An estimation of α has been done on the basis of simple probabilistic
in free
arguments of possible triad interactions,
decaying hydrodynamic turbulence, we ﬁnd numerically that the value α = −5/2
gives the right slope of the kinetic spectrum at large scales (k4 as predicted by the
turbulence theory in spectral space). Therefore α = −5/2 seems the most appropriate
value for hydrodynamic turbulence. In comparison we note that the local Sabra model
(corresponding here to α = −∞) leads to a slope about k9.
In the other hand, in MHD turbulence it is not obvious that α has to be the same
as in hydrodynamic turbulence. Actually, it is even not obvious that α should not
depend from the scale n, which is not possible in our model. Therefore we investigated
several values of α ranging several values from −∞ to zero. Several values of Pm have
been investigated depending if it is lower than, equal to or larger than 1. In order to
characterize the non local energy transfers from Xq to Yn within any possible triad,
the quantities TXY (q, n) have been derived an plotted versus q for a few values of n.
Though most of them are local, several energy transfers have been found to be partially
non local, depending on Pm.

Appendix A. Possible triads in logarithmic shell models

For a given shell n, we ﬁrst take beneﬁt from the fact that the triads (n, p, q) and (n, q, p)
are identical and then the representation in the plane (p, q) is symmetric with respect

A non local shell model of turbulent dynamo

to the diagonal. We then limit our demonstration to half of (12):

• Assuming p ≤ n − 1, we have λn + λp ≤ λn + λn−1. Then from (8) and (11) we

have |k3| ≤ k0λn+1, implying q ≤ n + 1.

• For p = n, we have λn + λp = 2λn. From (8) we have 2 ≤ λ2. Therefore from (11)

we have |k3| ≤ k0λn+2 and then q ≤ n + 2.

• From (8) we have λp+1 − λp ≥ λp−1. For p ≥ n + 1 we then have λp+1 − λp ≥ λn,

implying from (11) that |k3| ≤ k0λp+1 and then q ≤ p + 1.

• Assuming that p ≤ n − 3, from (11) we have |k3| ≥ k0|λn−1 − λn−4|. Then (8)
implies λn−1 ≥ λn−2 + λn−3 > λn−2 + λn−4. Then we have |k3| > k0λn−2 ≥ λn−1
and then q ≥ n − 1.

• For p = n − 2, from (11) we have |k3| ≥ k0|λn−1 − λn−3|. From (8) we have

λn−1 − λn−3 ≥ λn−2, implying |k3| ≥ λn−2 and then q ≥ n − 2.

Figure D1. Illustration of the energy transfers for Pm ≪ 1 for local (top) and non
local (bottom) model. The thickness of the arrow gives some qualitative estimate of
the strength of the transfer.

Figure D2. Same as ﬁgure D1 but for Pm = 1.

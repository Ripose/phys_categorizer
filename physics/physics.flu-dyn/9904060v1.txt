The Energetic Implications of Using Deforming
Reference Descriptions to Simulate the Motion of
Incompressible, Newtonian Fluids

Abstract

In this work the issue of whether key energetic properties (nonlinear, exponential–
type dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of
time dependent loading) are automatically inherited by deforming reference descrip-
tions is resolved. These properties are intrinsic to real ﬂows and the conventional
Navier–Stokes equations. A completely general reference description of an incom-
pressible, Newtonian ﬂuid, which reconciles the diﬀerences between opposing schools
of thought in the literature is derived for the purposes of this investigation.

The work subsequently focusses on establishing a class of time discretisations which
inherit these self–same energetic properties, irrespective of the time increment em-
ployed. The ﬁndings of this analysis have profound consequences for the use of
certain classes of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes in the context of deforming references.
It is signiﬁcant that many algorithms presently in use do not automatically inherit
the fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics. An “updated” approach as a
means of avoiding ever burgeoning deformation gradients and a still further simpli-
ﬁed implementation are further topics explored.

1 Introduction

Descriptions of ﬂuid motion are conventionally based on the principles of conservation of
mass and linear momentum. One might hope that all such descriptions would accordingly
exhibit key energetic properties (nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence

of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading) consistant
with the principle of energy conservation. These properties are intrinsic to real ﬂows and
the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations.

A completely general reference description of an incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid, which
reconciles the diﬀerences between the so–called arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (A.L.E.)
formulation of Hughes, Liu and Zimmerman [4] (deformation gradients absent) and
that of Soulaimani, Fortin, Dhatt and Ouellet [9] (deformation gradients present,
but use is problematic), is derived for the purposes of this investigation. The implications
of the resulting description are investigated in the context of energy conservation in a
similar, but broader, approach to that taken by others (eg. Simo and Armero [8]) for
the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations.

The work subsequently focusses on establishing a class of time discretisations which
inherit these self–same energetic properties irrespective of the time increment employed.
The ﬁndings of this analysis have profound consequences for the use of certain classes
of diﬀerence schemes in the context of deforming references. It is signiﬁcant that many
algorithms presently in use do not automatically inherit the fundamental qualitative
features of the dynamics. An “updated” approach as a means of avoiding ever burgeoning
deformation gradients which arise from the accumulated step–wise deformation of meshes
and a still further simpliﬁed implementation are further topics explored.

The main conclusions of this work are based on a new inequality and a number of lemmas.
These lemmas are mainly concerned with the new convective term. The new inequality is
used in place of where the Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality might otherwise have limited the
analysis. This analysis is extended in that non–zero boundaries, so–called free boundaries
and time–dependent loads are considered.

2 A Completely General Reference

The implementation of most numerical time integration schemes would be problematic
were a conventional Eulerian1 description of ﬂuid motion to be used in instances involving
deforming domains. The reason is that most numerical time integration schemes require
successive function evaluation at ﬁxed spatial locations. On the other hand meshes
rapidly snarl when purely Lagrangian2 descriptions are used.

Eulerian and Lagrangian references are just two, speciﬁc examples of an unlimited number
of conﬁgurations over which to deﬁne ﬁelds used to describe the dynamics of deforming
continua. They are both special cases of a more general reference description, a de-
scription in which the referential conﬁguration is deformed at will. A deforming ﬁnite
element mesh would be a good example of just such a deforming reference in practice.
The transformation to the completely general reference involves coordinates where used
as spatial variables only and the resultant description is therefore inertial in the same

way as Lagrangian descriptions are.

2.1 Notation

Consider a material body which occupies a domain Ω at time t. The material domain,
Ω0, is that corresponding to time t = t0 (the reference time, t0, is conventionally, but
not always, zero). A third conﬁguration, ˜Ω, which is chosen arbitrarily is also deﬁned for
the purposes of this work. The three domains are related in the sense that points in one
domain may be obtained as one–to–one invertible maps from points in another.

2.2 Some General Results for Functions Deﬁned on the Three

Domains

Three important results are necessary for the derivation of the completely general refer-
ence description and these are presented below.

The Material Derivative in Terms of a Completely General Reference

The material derivative of any vector ﬁeld ˜v in terms of a completely general, reference
is

where ˜vref is the velocity of the reference deformation, and ˜F is the deformation gradient
given by

This result (taken from Hughes, Liu and Zimmerman [4]) is obtained by recalling that
the material derivative (total derivative) is the derivative with respect to time in the
material conﬁguration. Thus

A more practical expression is needed for

(the velocity as perceived in the distorting

reference). This can be obtained by considering

λk(x0, t) = λ∗

k(˜λ(x0, t), t)

(see Figure 1 on page 3)

Substituting this expression into equation (2), the desired, suitably practicable result is
obtained.

An Element of Area in Terms of a Distorting Reference

The second important result can be recalled from general continuum mechanics. Consider
an element of area, size dA, with an outward unit normal n. Then

ndA = ˜F −t ˜N ˜Jd ˜A

(3)
where d ˜A and ˜N denote the respective analogous size and outward unit normal of this
element of area in the referential conﬁguration (capital “n” so as to remain consistent
with the notation, since ˜Ni
= ni in this case) and ˜J = det ˜F . This result is demonstrated
in most popular textbooks on continuum mechanics (eg. Lai, Rubin and Krempl [6]).

This result is demonstrated in most popular textbooks on continuum mechanics (eg. Lai,
Rubin and Krempl [6]).

2.3 Derivation of the Completely General Equation

One way in which to derive a completely general reference description of an incompress-
ible, Newtonian ﬂuid is to start with the balance laws in global (integral) form, and
to make the necessary substitutions in these integrals. The desired numerical imple-
mentation (similar to the conventional Navier–Stokes one which has been thoroughly
investigated and found to be stable) is then obtained.

Conservation of Mass

Let Ω(t) be an arbitrary sub–volume of material. The principle of conservation of mass
states that

where ρ is density, b is the body force per unit mass, σ is the stress, n the outward unit

is obtained, where ˜q and ˜w are respectively the arbitrary pressure and velocity of the

2.4 Reconciling the Diﬀerent Schools of Thought

The equations (7) and (8) are the completely general reference description of an incom-
pressible, Newtonian ﬂuid. They reduce to the so–called A.L.E. equations of Hughes,
Liu and Zimmerman [4] for an instant in which spatial and referential conﬁgurations
coincide. These simpliﬁed equations should, however, not be implemented where the im-
plementation requires evaluation about more than one point within each time step (see
Section 5 for a further, in–depth explanation). Under such circumstances the equations
of Hughes et al. are an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (A.L.E.) description in the
very true sense (this is not surprising considering the equations have their origins in the
arbitrarily, either Lagrangian or Eulerian programmes of Hirt, Amsden and Cook [3]).
This fact is further borne out in observing that key energetic properties, consistant with
the principle of energy conservation, are not automatically inherited by the equations of
Hughes et. al. in the context of more general references.

The momentum equations of Soulaimani, Fortin, Dhatt and Ouellet [9] are ﬂawed
as a result of the mistaken belief that ˜σ ˜F −1 ˜J is the Piola–Kirchoﬀ stress tensor of the
ﬁrst kind (pg. 268 of Soulaimani et al.). Yet another problem is illustrated by
rewriting the conventional incompressibility condition using the chain rule. The new
incompressibility condition which arises is most certainly

∂˜vi
∂ ˜xj

∂ ˜xj
∂xi

= 0

and not

∂˜vi
∂ ˜xj

∂ ˜xi
∂xj

= 0.

ˆJ omitted in the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of the
Further errors arising (eg.
momentum equation, equation (10) on pg. 268 of Soulaimani et al.) make the use of
these equations problematic.

3 The Energetic Implications of a Deforming Refer-

ence

The eﬀect of quantities parameterising reference deformation on key energetic properties
– nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stabil-
ity under conditions of time dependent loading – is investigated in this section. These

is essentially what is being investigated, with a view to establishing a set of conditions
under which the discrete approximation can reasonably be expected to inherit these self–
same energetic properties.

One might anticipate key energetic properties to be manifest only in instances involving
a ﬁxed contributing mass of material, whether its boundaries be dynamic, or not. An
analysis of this nature only makes sense in the context of a constant volume of ﬂuid
which, for simplicity, will have material limits.

Inequalities of the Poincar´e-Friedrichs type are a key feature of any stability analysis of
this nature. Gradient containing L2 terms need to be re–expressed in terms of energy.
In the case of a “no slip” (v = 0) condition on the entire boundary the situation is
straightforward, in that it is possible to use the standard Poincare-Friedrichs inequality:
there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that

∈

The use of the classical Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality is otherwise identiﬁed as a ma-
jor limitation, even in the conventional Navier–Stokes related analyses. The Poincar´e–
Friedrichs inequality is only applicable in very limited instances where the value for the
entire boundary is stipulated to be identically zero. For boundary conditions of a more
general nature, such as those encountered in this study, in which parts of the boundary
may be either a free surface or subject to traction conditions, a more suitable inequality
is required (notice that subtracting a boundary velocity and analising the resulting equa-
tion is not feasible as the equations are nonlinear). The Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality
does, furthermore, not hold on subdomains of the domain in question and the constant
is not optimal.

Further investigation (communication [7]) reveals a similar result, the so-called Poincar´e–
Morrey inequality, holds providing the function attains a value of zero somewhere on the
boundary. The Poincar´e-Morrey inequality states that a constant C2 > 0 exists such that

v

The proof of the Poincar´e-Morrey inequality is, however, similar to that of one of Korn’s
inequalities (see, for example, Kikuchi and Oden [5]). In particluar, it is non–constructive,
by contradiction and the constant cannot therefore be determined as part of the proof.
Viewed in this light the forthcoming inequality amounts to a speciﬁcation of the hypo-
thetical constant in the Poincar´e–Morrey inequality for domains of a particular geometry.
The particular types of geometry considered are those that arise in problems involving
the motion of rigid bodies such as pebbles on the sea bed; thus a free surface is present,
and the domain may be multiply connected.

4 The Energetic Implications of the Time Discreti-

sation

This section is concerned with establishing a class of time discretisations which inherit
the self–same energetic properties (nonlinear dissipation in the absence of forcing and
long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading) as the analytic problem,
irrespective of the time increment employed. In this section a generalised, Euler diﬀerence
time–stepping scheme for the completely general reference equation is formulated and
the energetic implications investigated in a similar vein as the analytic equations in the
previous section.

This stability analysis is inspired by the approach of others to schemes for the conventional
Navier–Stokes equations. The desirability of the attributes identiﬁed as key energetic
properties is recognised and they have been used as a benchmark in the analysis of
various of the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes schemes by a host of authors. Related
work on the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations can be found in a variety of
references, for example Temam [11] and Simo and Armero [8].

The analyses presented here are extended, not only in the sense that they deal with the
completely general reference equation, but also in that non–zero boundaries, so–called
free boundaries and time–dependent loads are able to be taken into account (the former
two as a consequence of the new inequality on page 10). The ﬁndings of this work have
profound consequences for the implementation of the deforming reference equations. It
is signiﬁcant that many algorithms used for long–term simulation do not automatically
inherit the fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.

It will presently become clear that it makes sense to perform the analyses for the time–
discrete equation in the context of divergence free rates of reference deformation only.
This is since relevant energy terms are not readilly recovered from the time-discrete
equations for deforming references in general. This investigation is accordingly restricted
to a subclass of reference deformations in which “reference volume” is conserved. This
is for reasons of expedience alone and the subclass of deformations is thought to be
representative.

Remark: Recall that in the investigation of the analytic problem, a term arising from the
manipulation of the acceleration containing term (the term containing the rate of change
of the Jacobian) cancelled with the convective energy. It is therefore not surprising that
assumptions pertaining to the acceleration containing term (in particular to the rate of
change of the Jacobian) in the discrete problem will, once made, also be necessary for
the corresponding discrete convective energy term to vanish (reﬀering to the div vref = 0
condition of Lemma 5). This is a good prognosis for the energetic behaviour of the
discrete problem in circumstances of reference deformations excluded by Assumption 1.

This concludes the preliminaries required for the analysis of the time–discrete equation.

4.1 Nonlinear Dissipation in the Absence of Forcing

The following analysis establishes a class of time–stepping schemes which exhibit nonlin-
ear dissipation in the absence of forcing regardless of the time increment employed.

Theorem 3 (Nonlinear Dissipation in the Absence of Forcing) Suppose that
the description is pure Lagrangian at any free boundaries and that the deformation rate
of the reference is divergence free. A suﬃcient condition for the kinetic energy associated

of the generalised time stepping–scheme (15) is to replace the arbitrary vector, w, with
˜vn+α. By further substituting (16) into (15) and eliminating the pressure containing term
in a similar manner to that in Theorem 1, an expression involving the diﬀerence in kinetic
energy over the duration of a single time step is obtained.

introduced by way of the reference.

5 An “Updated” Approach and a Simpliﬁed Imple-

mentation

Ever burgeoning deformation gradients accumulate for a straight forward implementa-
tion of the equations. Using an “updated” approach is one way of coping with this
otherwise rather daunting prospect. An “updated” approach is the result of a little,
well–worthwhile lateral thinking. An “updated” approach amounts to choosing a new
referential conﬁguration during each time step.

In the case of time stepping schemes based about a single instant (eg. the generalised
class of Euler diﬀerence schemes investigated in Section 4) a considerably simpliﬁed im-
plementation can further be achieved by a particularly appropriate choice of conﬁgura-
tions. Making the choice of a referential conﬁguration which coincides with the spatial
conﬁguration at the instant about which the time stepping scheme is based allows the
deformation gradient to be omitted altogether (the deformation gradient is identity under
such circumstances). For such implementations (those which require evaluation about a

These equations are not valid for any, arbitrary choice of reference or if the implemen-
tation requires the equation to be evaluated at more than one point within each time
step (eg. a Runge–Kutta or ﬁnite–element–in–time scheme). It is important to remember
that in a discrete context the reference conﬁguration is ﬁxed for the duration of the entire
time increment. Although the referential conﬁguration is hypothetical and can be chosen
arbitrarily for each time step, once chosen it is static for the duration of the entire time
step. Once the coincidence of conﬁgurations is ordained at a given instant, ˜F is deﬁned
by the deformation, both before and after, and must be consistant.

There would seem to be no reason why one would wish to deﬁne the deformation about
a conﬁguration other than that at the instant about which the implementation is based
(assuming the implementation used is indeed based about a single point eg. a ﬁnite
diﬀerence) thereby involving deformation gradients. Resolving the resulting diﬃculties
associated with the deformation gradients by means of a perturbation seems unnecessarily
complicated in the light of the above reasoning.

6 Conclusions

The correct equations, which describe the motion of an incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid
and which are valid for a completely general range of reference deformations, are equations
(7) and (8). For implementations requiring the equations to be evaluated about a single
instant within each time step only (eg. ﬁnite diﬀerences), the deformation gradients may
be assumed identity i.e. the equations of Hughes, Liu and Zimmerman [4] (equations
(22) and (23)) will suﬃce.

In this work it is shown (as was hoped) that nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the
absence of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading
are properties automatically inherited by deforming reference descriptions. The single
provisor is that such descriptions become fully Lagrangian at any moving boundaries.
These properties are intrinsic to real ﬂows and the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes
equations.

Relevant energy terms are not readily recovered from the time–discrete equations for
deforming references in general. Only for divergence free rates of reference deformation
which become fully Lagrangian at free boundaries could it consequently be guaranteed
that energy would not be artiﬁcially introduced to the algorithmic ﬂow by way of the
reference. The divergence free assumption was made for reasons of expedience alone and
the limitations of the time–discrete analysis are consequently not expected to detract from
the use of the method in any way. This is especially so when it is considered that, a term

arising from the manipulation of the acceleration containing term (the term containing the
rate of change of the Jacobian) cancelled with the convective energy in the investigation
of the analytic problem and that assumptions pertaining to the acceleration containing
term (in particular to the rate of change of the Jacobian) in the discrete problem were,
once made, also necessary for the corresponding discrete convective energy term to vanish
(reﬀering to the div vref = 0 condition of Lemma 5). If one were to be overly cautious on
this basis one would be faced with the additional challenge of enforcing a fully Lagrangian
description for nodes situated on any free boundaries, while deforming elements would
be required to deform at a rate which is divergence free. Such a totally divergence
free description may, however, not be possible. An alternative strategy would be to use
a fully Lagrangian description. Both the purely Lagrangian and purely Eulerian ﬂuid
descriptions have divergence free rates of distortion.

There are inherent problems with using certain classes of time–stepping schemes and
the use of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes more implicit than central diﬀerence is consequently
advocated. Such diﬀerences exhibit the key energetic properties (nonlinear, exponential–
type dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time
dependent loading) irrespective of the time increment employed. A backward diﬀerence
is the obvious choice. Calculations at time t + α∆t would require an intermediate mesh
and associated quantities for instances in which α

= 1 (since α > 1

2).

The author recommends a strategy in which a predominantly Eulerian description is
used, where possible, for the bulk of the problem (from an eﬃciency point of view) and
the completely general reference description for the remainder is appropriate. Purely
Eulerian descriptions have the advantage of a “one oﬀ” ﬁnite element construction and
involve none of the hazards of a badly distorted reference.

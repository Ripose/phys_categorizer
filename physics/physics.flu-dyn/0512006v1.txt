Bifurcations of solitary waves propagating along the interface between two ideal
ﬂuids are considered. The study is based on a Hamiltonian approach. It concen-
trates on values of the density ratio close to a critical one, where the supercritical
bifurcation changes to the subcritical one. As the solitary wave velocity approaches
the minimum phase velocity of linear interfacial waves (the bifurcation point), the
solitary wave solutions transform into envelope solitons. In order to describe their
behavior and bifurcations, a generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation describing
the behavior of solitons and their bifurcations is derived. In comparison with the
classical NLS equation this equation takes into account three additional nonlinear
terms: the so-called Lifshitz term responsible for pulse steepening, a nonlocal term
analogous to that ﬁrst found by Dysthe for gravity waves and the six-wave interac-
tion term. We study both analytically and numerically two solitary wave families
of this equation for values of the density ratio ρ that are both above and below the
critical density ratio ρcr. For ρ > ρcr, the soliton solution can be found explicitly
at the bifurcation point. The maximum amplitude of such a soliton is proportional
ρcr, and at large distances the soliton amplitude decays algebraically. A
to √ρ
stability analysis shows that solitons below the critical ratio are stable in the Lya-
punov sense in the wide range of soliton parameters. Above the critical density ratio
solitons are shown to be unstable with respect to ﬁnite perturbations.

I. INTRODUCTION

V )1/2. The width of the solitary wave increases proportionally to (Vcr −

The main goal of this paper is to study bifurcations for one-dimensional internal solitary waves
propagating along the interface between two ideal ﬂuids with diﬀerent densities ρ1 and ρ2. The
lighter ﬂuid with density ρ2 lies above the heavier ﬂuid with density ρ1: ρ = ρ2/ρ1 < 1. These
bifurcations occur if the solitary wave velocity V coincides with the minimum phase velocity Vcr
of linear internal waves. If the upper density ρ2 is small enough compared to the lower density ρ1,
then a bifurcation similar to that for pure gravity-capillary waves occurs [1–4]. In this case solitary
waves undergo a supercritical bifurcation at the critical velocity: their form approaches the form of
the envelope solitons for the focusing one-dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (1D NLSE)
[5,6]. The soliton amplitude behaves universally near the critical velocity V = Vcr: it vanishes like
(Vcr −
As the density ratio ρ increases, the character of the nonlinear interactions changes. The four-
8√5)/11 [7], that is when
wave coupling coeﬃcient decreases and vanishes at ρ = ρcr = (21

0.283. Such a value may not be obtained easily in a two-ﬂuid conﬁguration. However, it
may be relevant in a three-layer (or more) conﬁguration [8], or in nonlinear optics, where similar
singularities can occur. Above the critical ratio, solitary waves undergo a subcritical bifurcation:
at the critical velocity, their amplitude jumps from zero for ρ below ρcr, up to ﬁnite values when
ρ is above the critical density ratio. In order to describe such type of bifurcation, it is necessary
to keep the next order terms beyond the classical 1D NLSE. When the density ratio varies in a
neighborhood of the critical density ratio, it is possible to use, as in the derivation of the classical
NLSE, perturbation theory assuming that the interacting wave amplitudes are small. At leading
order, one needs to keep three kinds of terms. The ﬁrst one, coming from the four-wave interaction,

takes into account the so-called Lifshitz invariant [9]. This term is local relative to the amplitude
of the soliton and its ﬁrst spatial derivative and, as was shown in [10], appears from the expansion
of four-wave interaction element under the assumption about its analytical dependence. However,
for deep-water internal waves, as we show in this paper, there exists also a nonlocal term which
has the same order of magnitude as the ﬁrst one [11]. Its structure is similar to the Dysthe term
ﬁrst found for water (gravity) waves [12] (see also [13]). In the case of water waves, this term is
responsible for the interaction of a narrow wave packet (in k-space) with mean ﬂow, induced by
the packet. The third term takes into account six-wave interactions. In order to ﬁnd the six-wave
coupling coeﬃcient, one needs to calculate all possible renormalizations due to three-, four- and
ﬁve-wave interactions and therefore this partial problem requires a lot of cumbersome calculations.
For these calculations we use the Hamiltonian formalism (see the review [14], as well as the papers
[15,10]), which appears to be the most adequate method for this subject. In [7], a diﬀerent method
was used: the problem was reformulated as a spatial dynamical system and only the reversibility
was exploited. It is necessary to underline also that the use of the Hamiltonian approach to study
solitary waves gives an appropriate framework for the temporal behavior of the dynamics of solitary
waves, e.g. their stability. Through this formalism, it is easy to perform diﬀerent kinds of averaging
and perturbations. Second, it is crucial that by applying the Hamiltonian technique the averaging
equations of motion retain their original Hamiltonian form. In particular, this is of great help for
the investigation of soliton stability (see, for instance, [10]).

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

Consider the interface z = η(x, t) between two ideal incompressible ﬂuids with respective densities

ρ1 and ρ2, in the presence of gravity (with the acceleration g acting down the vertical z

the region
< z < η(x, t).
Flows of both ﬂuids are considered to be potential and two-dimensional. The ﬂuid velocities are
given by

where ψ1,2 = φ1,2|z=η. The given Hamiltonian form generalizes Zakharov’s canonical form for free-
surface hydrodynamics [20]. A Hamiltonian formulation of the problem of a free interface between
two ideal ﬂuids, under rigid lid boundary conditions for the upper ﬂuid, was also given by Benjamin
& Bridges [21]. Craig & Groves [22] give a similar expression, by using the Dirichlet-Neumann
operators for both the upper and lower ﬂuid domains (see also [23]).

The Hamiltonian can be expanded in series with respect to powers of the canonical variables. In
this case the steepness of the interface plays the role of a small parameter of expansion. Due to the
conservation of the total mass for each ﬂuid this expansion begins with the quadratic term.

It is more convenient to work in Fourier space. Let us introduce the normal variables ak by means

of the following formulas:

means that the leading term of the series in Eq. (II.15) corresponds to the ﬁrst harmonic, and all
other harmonics are small with respect to the parameter λ. This is the condition under which the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation is derived (see, for example, [15,24,25]). In this case, at leading
order in λ, we obtain the stationary NLSE (compare with [15,10,26])

The tilde denotes renormalization of the vertex T due to the interaction with the zeroth and second

soliton solution is a stationary point of the (averaged) Hamiltonian for ﬁxed N .

¿From Eq. (II.17) one can see that the localized solution is possible if the coupling coeﬃcient µ
is negative (focusing nonlinearity). We recall that in our case ω′′ > 0. In this case Eq. (II.17) can
be rewritten in dimensionless variables as follows:

Its soliton solution ψs is given by

Hence it follows that while approaching the critical velocity the soliton amplitude vanishes like
1/2. The latter means that our
λ = (1
approximation improves when approaching the critical velocity: the wave becomes more monochro-
matic and nonlinearity weaker. This approximation becomes exact at the critical velocity.

As we show in the next section such a situation occurs for all interfacial solitary waves when
8√5)/11 (see for example [7]). While
the density ratio is less than the critical value ρcr = (21
increasing ρ the four-wave coupling coeﬃcient µ remains negative up to the critical ratio, where it
vanishes. For ρ > ρcr the coeﬃcient µ becomes positive, so that the nonlinear interaction in (II.17)
changes its character, from focusing to defocusing.
In this case, in order to have solitary wave
solutions, one needs to keep next order terms beyond the classical nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(II.17), which should provide existence of localized solutions in the form of solitary waves. Such
solutions were computed numerically using the full water-wave equations by Laget & Dias [27].
Bridges et al. [28] computed ﬁnite-amplitude travelling waves near the transition from focusing to
defocusing. The simplest weakly nonlinear extension retains the terms due to six-wave interactions.
Such interactions should be of the focusing type in order to compensate for the defocusing four-
wave interaction. From this consideration it becomes clear that the soliton amplitude undergoes

6

a jump at the point V = Vcr.
It is easy to estimate that such a jump will be proportional to
√µ. In order to obtain convergence of the Hamiltonian series expansion, the jump must be small.
In other words, such an expansion will be valid if the deviation of ρ from its critical value ρcr is
small enough. The appearance of the jump at the critical velocity means that the soliton undergoes
subcritical bifurcation. Such type of bifurcation is analogous to phase transition of ﬁrst order.
If the corresponding jump is small then we have the analogue of the ﬁrst-order phase transition
close to the second-order phase transition. For phase transitions such a situation occurs in a small
neighborhood of the so-called tri-critical point.

Now we will give the general structure of the Hamiltonian expansion corresponding to interfacial
waves near the critical density ratio assuming the following two dimensionless parameters are small:

λ =

and θ = 1

ρ/ρcr.

As mentioned before, there are in this case three main contributions to nonlinear terms (which,
for instance, can balance dispersion, thus providing the existence of stationary solitary waves).
Two contributions come from the expansion of the four-wave interaction Hamiltonian. Because a
stationary localized solution is assumed to be an envelope soliton, i.e. its spectrum remains narrow

T1234 in order to ﬁnd

T0 and its

“derivatives” β and γ.

The usual way to calculate matrix elements consists in expanding the Hamiltonian in series with
respect to powers of the canonical variables Ψ and η. Then one substitutes in each term H (n,m)
of the Hamiltonian the variables Ψ and η expressed in terms of the normal amplitudes ak and a∗k
with the help of the formulas (II.6), and ﬁnally one symmetrizes each term H (n,m) against all aki

This relation can be taken as the deﬁnition of the Green operator G . According to this deﬁnition
this operator is self-adjoint as it should be. Of course, this fact can be veriﬁed also by direct

Note that the Hamiltonian H (3) for the interfacial case was ﬁrst calculated in the paper [18]. For
surface waves (ρ = 0 or A = 1) the expression for H (4) in the form (III.17) was presented in the
papers [20], [29].

After these calculations we can ﬁnd the needed matrix elements. First, let us consider the

However, for solitons near the bifurcation velocity V = Vcr when the density ratio is close to
Indeed we only

need to know the coupling coeﬃcients µ, β, γ and C in (II.24) and (II.25). A straightforward and
classical way to ﬁnd them is to use the diagram technique [30] based on the renormalization of
matrix elements. We will use this approach partially, only to calculate the constant µ. The three
other coeﬃcients (β, γ and C) can be found by using the procedure of averaging with respect to
high frequencies. In the present case, it is the carrying frequency ω0 of the main harmonic. The
amplitudes of all the other harmonics are assumed to be small in order to apply the perturbation
technique based on the Hamiltonian expansion.

34 is suﬃcient.

First we compute the coeﬃcient µ. As is well known (see [15] for example), if three-wave in-
teractions are not resonant, they can be excluded by canonical transformations that result in the
renormalization of the high-order matrix elements. In particular, for 2
2 interacting waves, such
a renormalization yields

Thus, in the four-wave interaction vertex, there are three contributions: the ﬁrst one comes from

stems from the renormalization (IV.1) due to three-wave interactions. The latter written for k1 =

cr is equal to 5/16. This gives for the critical

in agreement with the paper [7]. For ρ < ρcr, the four-wave coupling coeﬃcient is negative, and
the corresponding nonlinearity is of the focusing type. In this case, solitary waves near the critical
velocity Vcr are described by the stationary NLSE (II.17) and undergo a supercritical bifurcation
at V = Vcr [7]. For ρ > ρcr the coupling coeﬃcient changes sign and the bifurcation becomes
subcritical. To ﬁnd the soliton shape in this case we need to calculate three more coeﬃcients: β, γ
and C. The ﬁrst two coeﬃcients are deﬁned from the expansion of

34 near ki = k0.

To ﬁnd the coeﬃcient γ we shall use the averaging procedure. There are two contributions to γ.
The ﬁrst one comes from the Hamiltonian (III.17). Hence one can see that nonlocality arises from

In the previous section, we computed the coeﬃcients that are needed to analyze solitary wave
solutions and their bifurcations near the critical density ratio. As pointed out in Section II, soli-
tary wave solutions represent stationary points of the Hamiltonian for ﬁxed momentum P . When
the critical velocity is approached, the solitons are transformed into envelope solitons. The enve-
lope solitons, like the original ones, also represent stationary points but of the mean Hamiltonian,

It is important to note that all terms in (V.1) are small compared with ω0N . However, in the
soliton solution both dispersion and nonlinearity occur at a level comparable with λ2ω0N , where
λ2 = (Vcr −
1 . It follows, for instance, from the variational problem (V.2) or from the
V )/Vcr ≪
equation (V.3) for the soliton shape.

Equation (V.3) is a pseudo-diﬀerential equation. Besides diﬀerentiation it contains the integral
operator
k that introduces some complexity in its analysis. The equation (V.3) can be simpliﬁed
by introducing the amplitude r and the phase ϕ of ψ. Substituting ψ = reiϕ into Eq. (V.3) and
separating real and imaginary parts give the following equation for the phase:

to this equation (see below). This property can also be observed with γ = 0 (i.e.
in the absence

related to the critical stationary NLS equation. When γ = 0 this equation is nothing else than the
quintic NLS equation which, as is well-known (see, for instance, [32] or the review [33]), belongs
to the class of critical NLS equations. However, this property persists in the presence of nonlocal
nonlinearity. It follows, for instance, if one considers the behavior of the number of waves N on the
parameter λ2 for the soliton solution. Indeed, the change

reduces Eq. (V.16) to a form not containing λ:

Consequently, the number of waves for soliton solutions is independent on λ:

As λ

λ2r in equation (V.7) comes from the last two
independently on µ, the main balance of the term
last terms in its left-hand side. The latter means that we have convergence of two soliton branches
corresponding to diﬀerent signs of µ as λ

.

It is easy to show also that the Hamiltonian evaluated on the soliton solution of (V.16) is equal
to zero. However, for solitons with µ > 0, the Hamiltonian takes positive values, while for µ < 0
(focusing case) the Hamiltonian of solitons happens to be negative. This is a simple consequence
of the variational problem (V.2).

Solitons of both equations (V.7) and (V.16) with diﬀerent values of λ were found numerically
for both signs of µ as well as for µ = 0. In order to ﬁnd them, we used the method suggested by
V.I. Petviashvili [34]. The idea of the Petviashvili method is based on the solution of diﬀusive type
equations with the introduction of a new time τ . Stationary solutions of this extended equation
coincide with the soliton solution of the original equation that we are looking for. In the present
case we developed the following algorithm.

VI. STABILITY OF SOLITONS

In this section we study the stability of the solitons that we analyzed in the previous section. In
order to do that, we use the method based on Lyapunov’s theorem. Applying this theorem to the
present Hamiltonian system means the following: a soliton considered as a stationary point of the
Hamiltonian H for a ﬁxed number of waves N is stable if it realizes a minimum (or maximum) of
the Hamiltonian. If a stationary point represents a saddle point then the corresponding soliton is
expected to be unstable. The latter is only an indication that solitons are unstable. For instance,
the classical counterexample is the Hamiltonian H = p2
q2
2/2 for a system with
1/2
two degrees of freedom where the saddle point p = q = 0 is stable.

1/2 + q2

where rs is the solitary wave solution. Hence, it is seen that for negative µ the function H (a) is
bounded from below and its minimum, H s < 0, corresponds to the soliton. On the contrary, for
µ > 0, this function has a maximum equal to H s > 0, which is unbounded from below as a
0.
Moreover, in the latter case, it is possible to see that the stationary point corresponding to the soliton
solution is a saddle point. It follows immediately if, in addition to the scaling transformation, one

For µ < 0, however, this transformation shows that the soliton solution remains the minimum
point. We reach the same conclusion if we apply the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion [35] to the
soliton solutions. The criterion states that, if

physical interpretation. The quantity
If by adding one particle (i.e.
increasing N ) this level shifts towards the continuous spectrum,
then obviously such bound state will be unstable. As we saw in the previous section the derivative
∂Ns/∂λ2 is negative for µ > 0 and becomes positive when µ < 0 . We would like to emphasize that
the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion was derived for the classical NLS equation and, strictly speaking,
cannot be applied to our system. Thus, we have again indications that support stability of the lower
soliton branch and, respectively, instability for the upper branch. Note that this stability indication
is consistent with that for the cubic NLS solitons (V.8) which, as is well-known, are stable (see, e.g.
[33]).

Now we show that the lower soliton branch (µ < 0) is stable: solitons from this branch indeed

The ﬁnal step in proving the Hamiltonian boundedness is based on the estimate for the integral

Substitution of this inequality into the estimate (VI.3) results in the desired bound for H:

(cid:18)
It turns out that the numerical value of N3 = 1.3224 is almost the same as the critical number
Ncr = 1.3225, deﬁned by solitons with µ = 0. Thus, solitons from the lower branch which satisfy
the criterion (VI.4) are stable not only with respect to small perturbations but also against ﬁnite
ones. Concerning the solitons from the upper branch, they are all unstable with respect to ﬁnite
disturbances.

In summary, we would like to emphasize once more the diﬀerence between N3 and Ncr although
the derivative ∂Ns/∂λ2 is positive for the whole lower soliton branch and according to the Vakhitov-
Kolokolov criterion this branch is expected to be stable. Up to now it is an open question but we
think that it is so and N3 and Ncr should coincide.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

−

Thus, we have analyzed the behavior of solitons near the critical density ratio ρ = ρcr. Above
ρcr.
ρcr solitons undergo a subcritical bifurcation with the amplitude jump proportional to √ρ
Therefore our theory based on the Hamiltonian expansion works when this jump is small, i.e. in a
small vicinity of ρ = ρcr. In order to describe solitons a generalized NLS equation is derived based
on the Hamiltonian average over fast oscillations with the carrying frequency corresponding to the
critical soliton velocity V = Vcr. The generalized NLS equation contains three kinds of nonlinear
terms. The ﬁrst one is nothing else than the nonlinear frequency shift taking into account six-wave
nonlinear interactions. This is the local term. Another nonlinearity is responsible for steepening
the envelope solitons (this is the so-called Lifshitz term [9]). And ﬁnally we have found the nonlocal
contribution familiar to that calculated by Dysthe for gravity waves. This Dysthe term is focusing as
well as the six-wave nonlinear interaction term. Within the generalized NLS equation we analyzed
the stability of solitons. In particular, we have found a region of wave intensity, N
N3, where
solitons are stable. Their stability is based on the boundedness of the Hamiltonian from below.
For solitons above ρcr we have shown their possible instability, at least, instability with respect to
ﬁnite perturbations. An interesting problem is the nonlinear stage of this instability, whether it
can lead to the collapse of solitons. The latter question is important not only from the point of
view of interfacial waves but also because there exists some similarity between the generalized NLS
equation derived in this paper and those describing the behavior of short optical pulses in ﬁbers
from the femtosecond range of pulse durations.

APPENDIX A: SIX-WAVE COUPLING COEFFICIENT

As pointed out in Section III, the calculation of the nonlinear coupling coeﬃcients β, γ and of
the six-wave coeﬃcient C can be performed independently for each coeﬃcient. Therefore for the
coeﬃcient C this problem reduces to the calculation of the nonlinear frequency shift for the main
ω(k0) when the ﬁrst contribution to the nonlinear frequency shift
harmonic with k = k0 and ω0 ≡
2 is equal to zero. Second, in such a case, it is enough to consider its limit of
proportional to

a monochromatic wave, instead of a quasi-monochromatic wave. This means that one needs to
develop the perturbation theory assuming that

where the leading order corresponds to the main harmonic n = 1 and amplitudes of all other
(combined) harmonics are supposed to be small in comparison with the ﬁrst harmonic amplitude.

After this remark we introduce the small parameter ǫ so that

C1 = ǫψ(T ),

where T = ǫ4t is a slow time and ψ(T ) is the envelope of the main harmonic. Hence it is easy to
see that all needed combined harmonics Cn become functions of the slow time T and take in their
expansion powers of the parameter ǫ:

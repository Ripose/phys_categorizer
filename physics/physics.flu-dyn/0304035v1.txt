(Received 07 March 2003)

We present a model describing evolution of the small-scale Navier-Stokes turbulence due
to its stochastic distortions by much larger turbulent scales. This study is motivated by
numerical ﬁndings (Laval et al. (2001)) that such interactions of separated scales play
important role in turbulence intermittency. We introduce description of turbulence in
terms of the moments of the k-space quantities using a method previously developed
for the kinematic dynamo problem (Nazarenko et al. (2003)). Working with the k-space
moments allows to introduce new useful measures of intermittency such as the mean po-
larization and the spectral ﬂatness. Our study of the 2D turbulence shows that the energy
cascade is scale invariant and Gaussian whereas the enstrophy cascade is intermittent.
In 3D, we show that the statistics of turbulence wavepackets deviates from gaussianity
toward dominance of the plane polarizations. Such turbulence is formed by ellipsoids in
the k-space centered at its origin and having one large, one neutral and one small axes
with the velocity ﬁeld pointing parallel to the smallest axis.

1. Introduction

Finding a good turbulence model is a long standing problem. To be useful in appli-
cations, the model has to be suﬃciently simple and yet capable of capturing the basic
physical processes such as the energy cascade and the intermittent bursts. The cascades
appear to be a more robust property reasonably well described by classical turbulence
closures such as the direct interaction approximation (DIA) (Kraichnan (1961)) and its
derivatives (e.g. EDQNM Orszag (1966)). The turbulence intermittency appears to be
a more subtle process which depends on the detailed features of the dynamical ﬂuid
structures. Of particular importance is the question whether the intermittent bursts are
caused by ﬁnite-time vorticity “blow-ups” (believed to become real singularities in the
limit of zero viscosity) or a “slower” exponential vortex stretching by a large-scale strain
collectively produced by the surrounding vortex tubes. Note that the ﬁrst process is lo-
cal in the scale space, - it is usually viewed as two or more vortex tubes of similar and
implosively decreasing radius. On the other hand, the second process involves interaction
of signiﬁcantly separated scales, - a thin vortex tube and a large-scale strain. Recent nu-
merical simulations (Laval et al. (2001)) indicate that it is the nonlocal scale interactions
that are responsible for the deviations of the structure functions from their Kolmogorov

self-similar value whereas the net eﬀect of the local interactions is to reduce these devi-
ations. These conclusions lead to a model of turbulence in which a model closure (e.g.
DIA) is used for the local interactions whereas the nonlocal interactions are described by
a wavepacket (WKB) formalism which exploits the scale separation. The later describes a
linear process of distortion of small-scale turbulence by a strain produced by large scales.
Such a linear distortion is a familiar process in engineering applications, for example,
when a turbulent ﬂuid ﬂows through a pipe with a sudden change in diameter. It is
described by the rapid distortion theory (RDT) introduced by Batchelor & Proudman
(1954). The model considered in this paper is diﬀerent from the classical RDT in that
the distorting strain is stochastic and, therefore, we will call it the stochastic distortion
theory (SDT). We will study a simplest version of SDT in which the large-scale strain is
modeled by a Gaussian white (in time) noise in the spirit of the Kraichnan model used
for turbulent passive scalars (Kraichnan (1974)) and of the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model
from the turbulent dynamo theory (Kazentsev (1968); Kraichnan & Nagarajan (1967)).
Because most of studies so far have focused on the theories with local scale interactions,
we will devote our attention mainly to the description of the nonlocal interactions. The
local interactions are unimportant at small scales in 2D, but they should be taken into
account when 3D turbulence is considered. Similarly to RDT, the SDT model deals
with k-space quantities due to much greater simplicity of the pressure term in the k-
space. We will study statistical moments of the k-space quantities of all orders and
not only the second order correlators as it is customary for RDT. The higher k-space
correlators carry an information about the turbulence statistics and intermittency which
is not always available from the two-point coordinate space correlators, the structure
functions, which are popular objects in the turbulence theory. Indeed, intermittency in
some systems can be dominated by singular k-space structures which are not singular in
the x-space (e.g. periodic ﬁelds). These structures leave their signature on the scalings of
the k-space moments but not on the x-space structure functions. The system considered
in the present paper is of this type, and another example of this kind is the magnetic
turbulence in the kinematic dynamo problem (Nazarenko et al. (2003)). In fact, SDT
bears a lot of similarities to the turbulent dynamo problem and in this paper we will use
a method developed in Nazarenko et al. (2003) for its derivation. We will also see that,
like in the dynamo problem, the fourth order k-space moments allow us to introduce the
measures of the mean polarization and of the spectral ﬂatness, - the quantities of special
importance for characterization of the small-scale turbulence.

One can think of the GT as a local Fourier transform taken in a box centered at x
and having a size which is intermediate between L and l. The GT commutes with the
time and space derivatives, ∂t and
. Commutativity with ∂t is obvious. Note that the
GT commutes with

support of function f . The inverse GT is simply an integration over all wavenumbers,

Equation (2.4) provides an RDT description of turbulence generalized to the case when
both the mean strain and the turbulence are inhomogeneous. This equation has the form
of a WKB-type transport equation with characteristics given by (2.5) and (2.6). Consider

ﬂuid path) enters this equation as a given function of time. Equation (2.7) is applicable
to arbitrary slowly varying in space large-scale ﬂow. We formulate the SDT model as
equation (2.7) complemented by a prescribed statistics of the large-scale ﬂow. One can
use, for example, a numerically computed large-scale strain and use it as an input into the
equation (2.4) should later be integrated numerically. In this paper, however, we would
like to derive a reduced model via the statistical averaging which is possible by assuming
a suﬃciently simple statistics of the large-scale strain. Experiments and numerical data
indicate that Navier-Stokes turbulence is Gaussian at large scales and we will use this
property in our model. We will further assume that the strain is white in time with

(2.11)

However, any such choice will lead to (up to a time-scale constant) the same ﬁnal equa-
tions. The Gaussian white in time strain has also been used in the MHD dynamo the-
ory (Kazantsev-Kraichnan model: Kazentsev (1968), Kraichnan & Nagarajan (1967))
and in the theory of turbulent passive scalar (Kraichnan (1974); see also review of
Falkovich et al. (2001)). It is a natural starting point because of its simplicity.

Note that for realistic modeling of small-scale turbulence one has to describe a matching
to the large-scale range via a low-k forcing or a boundary condition. As we will see
later, some properties of the small-scale turbulence turn out to be independent of these
eﬀects, e.g. scalings in 2D case, whereas the 3D case is more sensitive to the boundary
conditions. Detailed modeling of the low-k forcing/boundary conditions is beyond the
scope of this paper. Below, we will simply consider forcing-free evolution of a ﬁnite-
support initial condition (decaying turbulence). We will also consider ﬁnite-ﬂux solutions
in 2D corresponding to the turbulent cascades in forced turbulence.

3. Generating Function

Let us consider the following set of 1-point correlators of Gabor velocities,

Ψn

s =

(2n−4s)
u(k)
|

u(k)2
|

2s
|

i

with n = 1, 2, 3, ... and s = 0, 1, 2, 3, .... Such correlators where shown in Nazarenko et al.
(2003) to be a fundamental set in case of homogeneous isotropic turbulence from which
one can express any of two-point correlators of the following kind

ui1 (k1)ui2 (k1)...uin (k1)uj1 (k2)uj2 (k2)...ujm (k2)
,
i
h

where i1, i2, .., in and j1, j2, .., jm take values 1, 2 or 3 indexing the components in 3D
space, and n and m are some arbitrary natural numbers. Note that homogeneity and
isotropy in SDT follow from the coordinate independence and isotropy of the strain and
it has to be understood only in a local sense, near the considered ﬂuid particle of the
large-scale ﬂow.

Now we deﬁne a generating function,

Z(λ, α, β, k) =

eλ|u(k)|2+αu(k)2+βu(k)2

where overline denotes the complex conjugation. This function allows one to obtain any
of the fundamental 1-point correlators (3.1) via diﬀerentiation with respect to λ, α and
β,

To derive an evolution equation for Z we will follow the technique developed in

Gaussian integration by parts. Then, we use whiteness of the strain ﬁeld to ﬁnd the
response function (functional derivative of ul with respect to σij ). Finally, we use the
isotropy of the strain so that the ﬁnal equation involves only k =
and no angular
coordinates of the wave vector. Leaving the derivation for the Appendix, we write here

Equation (3.9) is the main equation of SDT. The RHS of this equation describes inter-

4. 2D turbulence

Let us ﬁrst of all consider the 2D case. The large time dynamics of the small-scale
turbulence is known to be dominated in 2D by the nonlocal interactions due to generation
of intense large-scale vortices and, therefore, the SDT model (3.9) is relevant even without
including a model for the local interactions. Note that equations for the 2D turbulence
in which only nonlocal interactions are left are formally identical to the passive scalar
equations. The energy spectra of the nonlocal 2D turbulence and the passive scalars
in the Batchelor regime were studied in Nazarenko & Laval (2000) without making any
assumptions on the strain statistics. Here we will study the higher k-space correlators.

Of special interest are the cascade-type solutions realized when turbulence is forced. To

seen from the vorticity conservation along the ﬂuid paths, the energy invariance is not obvious
because there can be non-local energy exchanges between turbulence and the large-scale ﬂow.

broken scale invariance and growing deviation from Gaussianity at small scales. Such a
small-scale intermittency in the direct cascades is due to nearly singular k-structures
having the shape of strongly elongated ellipses in 2D k-space which are centered at the
origin. Each strain realization will produce just one of these (randomly oriented) ellipses
out of an initial circular (isotropic) distribution.

5. Nonlocal 3D turbulence

3D Navier-Stokes turbulence is never likely to be nonlocal and for its realistic de-
scription one should add a model of the local interactions into the RHS of equation
(3.9). However, it is still interesting to solve equation (3.9) as is in order to study the
eﬀect of pure nonlocal interactions. We will see below that such a study will reveal some
interesting physics.

The standard procedure to obtain equations for the correlators Ψn
s is to diﬀerentiate
(5.1) with respect to λ and η the required number of times and then to put λ = η = 0.
In the 3D case, all the correlators Ψn
s are independent and at each order 2n we have a
system of coupled equations rather than a single equation to solve as it was the case in
2D. However, a decoupling arises asymptotically at large times as we will see below. We
will start by considering the second and the fourth order correlators (n = 1 and 2).

Diﬀerentiating (5.1) with respect to λ and taking the result at λ = η = 0 we have

This equation is similar to the Kazantsev equation (Kazentsev (1968)) describing evolu-
tion of the magnetic energy spectrum in the kinematic dynamo theory. Similarly to the
dynamo theory, the total energy grows exponentially and therefore, unlike the 2D case,
no stationary cascade states are possible. To have a steady state, one has to add a model
of local interactions to SDT which will be done in future publications. However, we will
now study equation (5.3) to examine consequences of interactions of separated scales.

Recently, Schekochihin, Boldyrev and Kulsrud (Schekochihin et al. (2002a)) presented
the solution of the Kazantsev equation obtained by the Kontorovich-Lebedev transform
and we will use their results to solve (5.2). By substitution

corresponds to the case where all Fourier components of the magnetic ﬁeld have plane
polarization. If W
= 0 then other polarizations (circular, ecliptic) are present. This is the
case for example for Gaussian ﬁelds when W = E2/2 > 0. On the other hand, smallness

of the phase diﬀerences can be overpowered in W by large amplitudes. Therefore, a better
measure of the mean polarization would be a normalized W , e.g.,

P = W/S.

(6.6)

Deﬁned this way the mean turbulence polarization is an example of an important physical
quantity which can be obtained from the one-point Fourier correlators and is unavailable
from the coordinate space (one-point or two-point) correlators.

Equation (6.4) can be solved similarly to the energy spectrum equation (5.3), namely
by transforming it into equation (5.5) by a substitution similar to (5.4) and then using
the solution (5.6). In the inviscid regime ( p

where W0 is a constant which can be found from the initial conditions. We see that
W develops a k−7/2 scaling range which is cut oﬀ at low and high k by exponentially
propagating fronts. Within this scaling range, W decays exponentially in time.

Given W , one can ﬁnd S by using substitution S = V + W/3 which leads to a closed
equation for V which can be solved similarly to E and W . This gives for the inviscid
regime

(6.9)

As we see, in the inviscid regime the mean polarization tends to an independent of k
value which exponentially decays in time. This means that all turbulence wavepackets
eventually become plane polarized. Recall that such turbulence is very far from being
Gaussian for which the mean polarization remains ﬁnite (elliptic and circular polarized
modes are present).

In the diﬀusive regime, t

(ln q)2, we have

≫

W (k) = W0 t−1/2e−25Ωt/6 k−7/2 ln(kd/√2k)

(6.10)

and

S(k) = V0 t−1/2e47Ωt/6 k−7/2 ln(kd/√2k).
Thus, P is still give by the same formula (6.9) indicating that the mean polarization
continues to further decrease in time with the same exponential rate. Thus, by the time
the diﬀusive regime is achieved W can be essentially put equal to zero.

(6.11)

The fact that the polarization becomes plane has quite simple physical explanation.
Indeed, a vorticity wavepacket of arbitrary polarization will be strongly distorted by the
stretching which mostly occurs along the dominant eigenvector of the lagrangian defor-
mation matrix (corresponding to the greatest Lyapunov exponent). Such a stretching
make any initial “spiral” ﬂat for large time with the dominant ﬁeld component lying in
the plane passing through the stretching and the wavevector directions (and, of course,
u(k) is perpendicular to k).

Another important measure of turbulence intermittency available from the k-space
moments is the spectral ﬂatness which can be deﬁned as F = S/E2. For large time in

(6.12)

We see that the ﬂatness growths both in time and in k which indicates presence of the
small-scale intermittency. Such an intermittency can be attributed to the presence of
coherent structures in k-space.

One can also ﬁnd solution for the fourth order correlator S in the dissipative regime.

This will be done in the next section together with correlators of all higher orders.

7. Large-time behavior of higher correlators

The observation in the end of the previous section (that there is a dominant ﬁeld

component) allows us to predict that for large time

that Zλλ ≈

ηZηη satisﬁes a closed homogeneous equation. This means that if w

solutions of (3.9) (corresponding to large-time asymptotics of the general solution) such
that Zλλ = Zαβ. Assuming this equality in (3.9) and putting η = 0 we have,

This expression agrees with the results obtained in the previous sections for n = 1 and
n = 2. We see that the main eﬀect of the dissipation is the prefactor change t−1/2
→
t−3/2 and the K0(k/kd) form-factor which corresponds to a log-correction at k
1 and
kd. Similar results were obtained for the magnetic ﬁeld
an exponential cut-oﬀ at k
moments in Nazarenko et al. (2003). In that case it is the exponential cut-oﬀ that causes
the change of the exponential growth in the mean magnetic energy (Kazentsev (1968),
Kulsrud & Anderson (1992)) and in the higher x-space moments of the magnetic ﬁeld
(Chertkov et al. (1999)).

The scalings in (7.4) and (7.5) with respect to the order n contain important informa-
tion about the small-scale turbulence. In particular the exponential growth in time with

for the magnetic ﬁelds in the kinematic dynamo problem was obtained in Chertkov et al.
(1999) and Schekochihin et al. (2002b). The log-normality arises because the strain is
a multiplicative noise for the velocity ﬁeld which becomes nearly one-dimensional and
because the time integrated strain tends to become a Gaussian process. Formally, this
result can be also obtained using the random matrix theory of Furstengerg (1963) (see
also Falkovich et al. (2001)), and a more detailed physical explanation can be found in
Nazarenko et al. (2003).

The k-dependence of the Fourier correlators is also very important because it gives
an information about the dominant structures in the wavenumber space. Suppose that
initially the turbulence is isotropic and concentrated in a ball centered at the origin in
the wavenumber space. For each realization such a ball will stretch into an ellipsoid with
one large, one short and one neutral dimensions. One can visualize this ellipsoid as an
elongated ﬂat cactus leaf with thorns showing the velocity ﬁeld direction. Note that in
this picture one component of the velocity ﬁeld (transverse to the cactus leaf) is dominant
which is captured by the fact that the polarization W introduced in this paper tends to
zero at large time. Another consequence of this picture is that the wavenumber space
will be covered by the ellipsoids more sparsely at large k which implies large intermittent
ﬂuctuations of the velocity ﬁeld in the k-space. These ﬂuctuations could be quantiﬁed
by the ﬂatness F which was shown in (6.12) to grow as k3/2, a clear indication of the
small-scale intermittency.

8. Sensitivity of SDT to the strain statistics

In the previous sections, the SDT model was formulated and studied assuming that
the large-scale strain is a Gaussian white noise process. This assumption, similar to the
Kazantsev-Kraichnan dynamo model, allowed us to obtain some important analytical
solutions for the energy spectrum, the polarization, the ﬂatness and higher-order corre-
lators which capture the turbulence intermittency. In real experimental and in numerical
turbulence the strain is generally far from being a Gaussian white noise. Thus, it is inter-
esting to study sensitivity of our SDT model and its predictions to the strain statistics.
In this section, we will numerically simulate (2.7) for two diﬀerent types of strain.
First, we consider a synthetic Gaussian strain ﬁeld with a ﬁnite correlation time τ which
is algorithmically generated as

σij (t + dt) = (1

dt/τ ) σij (t) + Ω

2 dt/τ

Aij (t)

Allδij (cid:19)

where Aij is the same matrix as in (2.9) and dt is the time step. The r.m.s. of the diﬀerent
strain components in this numerical experiment ranged from 2.9 to 3.6 and the correlation
time was 0.02. Thus, the correlation time was about 16 times less than the characteristic
strain distortion time. We considered 512 strain realizations of the synthetic ﬁeld.

In the second numerical experiment, the strain matrix components were obtained from
a 5123 spectral DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds number Rλ ≃
200. The
strain time series were recorded along 512 ﬂuid paths. The r.m.s. of the diﬀerent strain
components in this case ranged from 6.6 to 9.3 and the correlation time was approximately
0.08. Thus, the correlation time in this case is of the same order as the inverse strain rate
which is natural for the real Navier-Stokes turbulence where both values are of order of
the eddy turnover time at the Kolmogorov scale.

Because of the fairly short correlation time and because of the Gaussianity, the ﬁrst
numerical experiment is closer to the Gaussian white-noise analytical model than the
second experiment where the strain is not Gaussian and has long time correlations. In a

sense, comparison of results of the ﬁrst experiment and the analytical solutions may be
considered a performance test of the numerical method. On the other hand, comparison
between the results of the ﬁrst and the second experiments allows us to establish their
sensitivity to the strain statistics.

To compute (2.7) we used a second order in time Runge-Kutta scheme with a time step
of 20 times less than the correlation time for the synthetic case. For the simulation with
strain from DNS, a time step identical to the DNS have been used (i.e. 200 times less than
the correlation time of strain) In both numerical experiments, for each strain realization
we consider a distribution of wavepackets (2048 in the synthetic case and 8192 for the
DNS) with initial k chosen randomly in a sphere of radius
2. For each wavenumber
k, the two Fourier components of the velocity u1 and u2 are chosen randomly such that
uj = βjγei2παj where αj, βj are uniform random numbers in the interval [0, 1] and
04 is a constant (function of the total number of particles). The last component

Figures 1 and 2 show the energy spectrum at several diﬀerent moments of time in the
ﬁrst and the second numerical experiment correspondingly. In both cases one can see an
excellent agreement with the theoretical -2.5 slope for time less than td which is about
4.5 and 0.7 for the ﬁrst and the second experiments respectively. At t = td, turbulence
reaches the dissipative scale and the spectrum accepts a log-corrected shape.

Figures 3 and 4 show the time growth of the total energy and the energy spectrum at
several ﬁxed wavenumbers in the ﬁrst and the second numerical experiment respectively.
One can see that the growth is approximately exponential as predicted by the theory.
It is interesting that the theory also predicts a change to a slower exponential growth

Figures 5 and 6 show the spectrum of the polarization at several ﬁxed wavenumbers in

Figures 7 and 8 show the spectrum of the ﬂatness at several ﬁxed wavenumbers in the
ﬁrst and the second numerical experiment respectively. Similarly to the white-noise pre-
dictions, the ﬂatness is growing with time. However, the theoretical 3/2 slope is observed
neither for the synthetic nor for the DNS strain case. The fact that these deviations are
observed in the same way for both the DNS strain and the synthetic strain (which is short
correlated and therefore quite close to the white noise process) might indicate a failure
of the numerical method to reproduce some features of higher correlators rather than a
true deviation due to the diﬀerences in the strain statistics. Further discrepancy arises
for the DNS strain case at very large time when the ﬂatness is observed to decrease.

9. Conclusion

In this paper we introduced a description of the small-scale Navier-Stokes turbulence
with much larger scales, the SDT model. Such nonlocal interactions dominate in 2D
turbulence at large time. In 3D, they were shown to be responsible for intermittency
in numerical experiments (Laval et al. (2001)). The SDT model assumes that the large
scales are Gaussian and short correlated in time and it describes turbulence in terms of

found steady state solutions for correlators of all orders. These solutions correspond to

forced turbulence and they describe cascades of the energy and enstrophy series of invari-
ants (two invariants at each order). The energy cascades are non-intermittent: initially
Gaussian turbulence at the forcing scale remains Gaussian and scale invariant through-
out the inertial range. On the contrary, the scale invariance and gaussianity break down
for the enstrophy cascades and a regime dominated by thin elliptical structures develops
in the k-space. In 3D, we found that the steady state does not exist in SDT and the total

energy grows in a dynamo-like fashion. To have a realistic description of the steady state
of the Navier-Stokes turbulence one have to compliment SDT with a model for the local
scale interaction which will be done in future work. However, the study of the purely
nonlocal interaction presented in this paper reveals several interesting eﬀects which are
likely to persist in some form when the local interactions are taken into account. In
particular, the nonlocal interactions are shown to lead to an interesting turbulent state

A model for rapid stochastic distortions of small-scale turbulence

in which all modes have plane polarization in the k-space. Statistics of such turbulent
ﬁelds is far from being Gaussian (in which all polarizations are present). Similar eﬀect
for the dynamo magnetic ﬁelds was found in Nazarenko et al. (2003). The k-space mo-
ments allow also to quantify the dominant coherent structures in the k-space which are
responsible for intermittency in similar way as the x-space moments capture the k-space
structures. Note that singular structures in the k-space are not necessarily singular in the
x-space (e.g. a ﬁeld periodic in some direction is a singular 1D line in the k-space). For
the Navier-Stokes turbulence, the intermittent k-space structures are found to be very
elongated ellipsoids centered at the origin. These structures leave their signatures on the
spectral ﬂatness and on the scalings of the higher k-space moments with respect to the
order n. Further, similarly to the kinematic dynamo problem the scalings indicate pres-
ence of the log-normal statistics of the small-scale velocity ﬁelds. Naturally, putting back
the local interactions into the model will weaken the tendency to form elongated ellip-
soids and plane polarized wavepackets, but some deviation from the Gaussian statistics
in the direction predicted by these tendencies should be expected in real Navier-Stokes
turbulence.

We studied numerically the SDT model (2.7) for a synthetic Gaussian strain with
a ﬁnite correlation time and for a strain ﬁeld obtained from a 5123 spectral DNS of
the Navier-Stokes equation. The results show that most predictions of the white-noise
theory, such as e.g. the energy spectrum shape, the polarization decrease and the increase
of the spectral ﬂatness, are also observed in these two cases of the strain. Thus, the SDT
equations obtained for the Gaussian white noise strain are likely to be a good model for
the nonlocal interactions in real Navier-Stokes turbulence.

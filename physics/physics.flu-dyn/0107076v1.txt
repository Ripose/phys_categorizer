We analyzed the eﬀect of viscoelasticity on the dynamics of ﬂuids in porous media by studying
the ﬂow of a Maxwell ﬂuid in a circular tube, in which the ﬂow is induced by a wave traveling on
the tube wall. The present study investigates novelties brought about into the classic peristaltic
mechanism by inclusion of non-Newtonian eﬀects that are important, for example, for hydrocarbons.
This problem has numerous applications in various branches of science, including stimulation of ﬂuid
ﬂow in porous media under the eﬀect of elastic waves. We have found that in the extreme non-
Newtonian regime there is a possibility of a ﬂuid ﬂow in the direction opposite to the propagation
of the wave traveling on the tube wall.

I. INTRODUCTION

Investigation of ﬂow dynamics of a ﬂuid in a tube having circular cross-section, induced by a wave traveling on its
wall (boundary), has many applications in various branches of science. The physical mechanism of the ﬂow induced
by the traveling wave can be well understood and is known as the so-called peristaltic transport mechanism. This
mechanism is a natural cause of motion of ﬂuids in the body of living creatures, and it frequently occurs in the organs
such as ureters, intestines and arterioles. Peristaltic pumping is also used in medical instruments such as heart-lung
machine etc.[1].

Laboratory experiments have shown that an external sonic radiation can considerably increase the ﬂow rate of a
liquid through a porous medium (Refs.[1,2] and references therein). Initially, the idea of ﬂow stimulation via waves
traveling on the ﬂow boundary, in the context of porous media, has been proposed by Ganiev and collaborators [3].
They proposed that sonic radiation generates traveling waves on the pore walls in a porous medium. These waves,
in turn, generate net ﬂow of ﬂuid via the peristaltic mechanism. Later, this problem has been studied in a number
of publications, where authors used diﬀerent simplifying assumptions in order to solve the problem (see e.g. Ref.[4]).
The most recent and general study of stimulation of ﬂuid ﬂow in porous media via peristaltic mechanism is presented
in Ref.[1], which we will use as a starting point in order to include non-Newtonian eﬀects into the peristaltic model.
It is clear that a usual peristaltic mechanism discussed, e.g., in Ref.[1] can be used to describe the behavior of a
classic Newtonian ﬂuid; however, for example, oil and other hydrocarbons exhibit signiﬁcant non-Newtonian behavior
[5]. The aim of this paper is therefore to incorporate non-Newtonian eﬀects into the classical peristaltic mechanism
[1]. Thus, the present work formulates a realistic model of the peristaltic mechanism which is applicable to the
non-Newtonian ﬂuids (e.g. hydrocarbons) and not only to the Newtonian ones (e.g. ordinary water) which have been
extensively investigated in the past [1].

It should be noted that there were similar studies in the past ([6] and references therein). However, the previous
contributions discussed peristaltic mechanism for rheological equations other than the Maxwellian one. Thus, the
present study ﬁlls this gap in the literature. In addition, this study is motivated by the recent results of del Rio,
de Haro and Whitaker [7] and Tsiklauri and Beresnev [8], who found novel eﬀects, including the enhancement of a
Maxwellian ﬂuid ﬂow in a tube that is subjected to an oscillatory pressure gradient.

We consider an axisymmetric cylindrical tube (pore) of radius R and length L. We assume that elastic wave induces

a traveling wave on the wall (boundary) of the tube with the displacement of the following form:

where a is the amplitude of the traveling wave, while λ and c are its wave-length and velocity, respectively. We note
that z-axis of the (r,φ,z) cylindrical coordinate system is directed along the axis of the tube.

W (z, t) = R + a cos(

(z − ct)),

where ρ, p and ~v are the ﬂuid density, pressure and velocity, respectively; ˜τ represents the viscous stress tensor. We
describe the viscoelastic properties of the ﬂuid using the Maxwell’s model [7], which assumes that

where µ is the viscosity coeﬃcient and tm is the relaxation time.
We further assume that the following equation of state holds

where κ is the compressibility of the ﬂuid. We also assume that the ﬂuid’s velocity has only r and z components.

We make use of ”no-slip” boundary condition at the boundary of the tube, i.e.

Eq.(4) can be re-written in the following form:

vr(W, z, t) =

Further, we apply the operator (1 + tm∂/∂t) to the momentum equation (3) and eliminate ˜τ in it using Eq.(7):

(cid:21)

The equations are made dimensionless by scaling the length by R and time by R/c. Also, we have introduced the
following dimensionless variables (and have omitted the tilde sign in the latter equations): ˜W = W/R, ˜ρ = ρ/ρ0,
˜vr = vr/c, ˜vz = vz/c, ˜p = p/(ρ0c2). Here, ρ0 is the regular (constant) density at the reference pressure p0. We have
also introduced ǫ = a/R, α = 2πR/λ, Re = ρ0cR/µ, χ = κρ0c2.

Following Ref.[1], we seek the solution of the governing equations in a form:

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

Then, doing a usual perturbative analysis using the latter expansions, we can obtain a closed set of governing

equations for the ﬁrst (ǫ) and second (ǫ2) order.

Further, following the authors of [1,8], we seek the solution of the liner problem in the form:

p = p0 + ǫp1(r, z, t) + ǫ2p2(r, z, t) + ...,

vr = ǫu1(r, z, t) + ǫ2u2(r, z, t) + ...,

vz = ǫv1(r, z, t) + ǫ2v2(r, z, t) + ...,

ρ = 1 + ǫρ1(r, z, t) + ǫ2ρ2(r, z, t) + ... .

u1(r, z, t) = U1(r)eiα(z−t) + ¯U1(r)e

−iα(z−t),

v1(r, z, t) = V1(r)eiα(z−t) + ¯V1(r)e

−iα(z−t),

2

p1(r, z, t) = P1(r)eiα(z−t) + ¯P1(r)e

−iα(z−t),

ρ1(r, z, t) = χP1(r)eiα(z−t) + χ ¯P1(r)e

−iα(z−t).

Here and in the following equations the bar denotes a complex conjugate.
On the other hand, we seek the second (ǫ2) order solution in the form:

u2(r, z, t) = U20(r) + U2(r)ei2α(z−t) + ¯U2(r)e

−i2α(z−t),

v2(r, z, t) = V20(r) + V2(r)ei2α(z−t) + ¯V2(r)e

−i2α(z−t),

p2(r, z, t) = P20(r) + P2(r)ei2α(z−t) + ¯P2(r)e

−i2α(z−t),

ρ2(r, z, t) = D20(r) + D2(r)ei2α(z−t) + ¯D2(r)e

−i2α(z−t).

The latter choice of solution is motivated by the fact that the peristaltic ﬂow is essentially a non-linear (second
order) eﬀect [1], and adding a non-oscillatory term in the ﬁrst order gives only trivial solution. Thus, we can add
non-oscillatory terms, such as U20(r), V20(r), P20(r), D20(r), which do not cancel out in the solution after the time
averaging over the period, only in the second and higher orders.

In the ﬁrst order by ǫ we obtain:

Note, that Eqs.(12)-(13) are similar to Eq.(3.11) from Ref.[1], except that γ and β are modiﬁed by substitution
Re → (1 − iαtm)Re.

Repeating the analysis similar to the one from Ref.[1], we obtain the master equation for U1(r) and ﬁnd its general

U1(r) = C1I1(νr) + C2I1(βr),

where I1 is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order 1; and C1 and C2 are complex constants deﬁned by

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In the previous section, we have shown that the inclusion of non-Newtonian eﬀects into the classical peristaltic
mechanism by using the Maxwell ﬂuid model yields the following change: Re → (1 − iαtm)Re in all of the solutions.
It is known that the viscoelastic ﬂuids described by the Maxwell model have diﬀerent ﬂow regimes depending on
the value of the parameter De = tv/tm, which is called the Deborah number [7]. In eﬀect, Deborah number is a ratio
of the characteristic time of viscous eﬀects tv = ρR2/µ to the relaxation time tm. As noted in Ref.
[7], the value
of the parameter De (which the authors of Ref.[7] actually call α) determines in which regime the system resides.
Beyond a certain critical value (Dec = 11.64), the system is dissipative, and conventional viscous eﬀects dominate.
On the other hand, for small De (De < Dec) the system exhibits viscoelastic behavior.

A numerical code has been written to calculate < Q > according to Eq.(16). In order to check the validity of our
code, we run it for the parameters similar to the ones used by other authors. For instance, for ǫ = 0.15, Re = 100.00,
α = 0.20, χ = 0, tm = 0 we obtain < Q >= 0.2708706458, which is equal (if we keep 4 digits after the decimal point)
to the result of the authors of Ref.[1] who actually obtained < Q >= 0.2709.

Further, we have made several runs of our code for diﬀerent values of the parameter tm. We note again that tm
enters the equations because we have included non-Newtonian eﬀects into our model. Eq.(16) will be identical to the
similar Eq.(4.1) from Ref.[1] if we set tm = 0 in all our equations.

The results of our calculation are presented in Fig.1, where we investigate the dependence of < Q > on the
compressibility parameter χ for the various values of tm. In order to compare our results with the ones from Ref.[1],
we have plotted < Q > for the following set of parameters: ǫ = 0.001, Re = 10000.00, α = 0.001, tm = 0 (solid line).
We note that the curve is identical to the corresponding curve in Fig.2 from Ref.[1]. This obviously corroborates the
validity of our numerical code. Further, to investigate the dependence of the ﬂow rate < Q > on tm, we perform
the calculation for a few values of tm. When tm = 1.0, we notice no noticeable change in the plot as both curves
coincide within the plotting accuracy. For tm = 100.00 (dashed curve with crosses), we notice slight deviation from the
Newtonian limiting case (solid line), which translates into shifting the maximum towards larger χ’s. For tm = 1000.00
(dash-dotted curve with asterisks), we notice further deviation from the Newtonian ﬂow, which also translates into
shifting the maximum towards larger χ’s. However, for tm = 10000.00 (dashed curve with empty squares), we note
much more drastic changes, including the absence of a maximum and rapid growth of < Q > in the considered interval
of variation of compressibility parameter χ. The observed pattern conforms to our expectation, since large tm means
small De (De < Dec) and the system exhibits strong viscoelastic behavior. Note that tm is dimensionless and scaled
by R/c.

After the above discussion it is relevant to deﬁne quantitatively the transition point where the ﬂow starts to exhibit
It is known [7] that De = tv/tm = (ρR2)/(µtm). Now, using deﬁnition of

(non-Newtonian) viscoelastic eﬀects.
Re = ρcR/µ we can deﬁne critical value of tm as

tmC =

Re
Dec (cid:19)

R
c

.

(cid:18)

(17)

In all our ﬁgures we have used Re = 10000.0. If we put the latter value of Re and the critical value of the Deborah
number 11.64 [7] into Eq.(17) we obtain tmC = 859.11 (measured in units of R/c). Therefore, the values of tm greater
than tmC (for a given Re) correspond to sub-critical (De < Dec) Deborah numbers for which viscoelastic eﬀects are
pronounced.

In Fig.2 we investigate the behavior of the ﬂow rate < Q > on the parameter α, which is the tube radius measured
in wave-lengths. Again, to check for the consistency of our numerical results with the ones from Ref.[1] and also
investigate novelties brought about by the introduction of non-Newtonian eﬀects (appearance of non-zero relaxation
time tm) into the model, we ﬁrst plot < Q > versus α for the following set of parameters: ǫ = 0.001, Re = 10000.00,
χ = 0.6, tm = 0. If we compare the solid curve in our Fig.2 with the dashed curve in Fig.3 of Ref.[1], we will note
no diﬀerence, which again corroborates the validity of our numerical code. We then set tm to various non-zero values
and investigate the changes introduced by non-Newtonian eﬀects. As in Fig.1, we notice no change for tm = 1.0. For
tm = 100.00 and tm = 1000.00, we notice that ﬂow rate somewhat changes attaining lower values as α (radius of the
tube) increases.

We treat the latter, tm = 1000.00, case separately for the reason of an appearance of a novel eﬀect of negative ﬂow
rates when the interval of variation of α is increased up to 0.05. Again, we expect that for large tm (tm > tmC =
859.11), i.e. small De (De < Dec), the system should exhibit viscoelastic behavior. We note from Fig.3 that for
α ≥ 0.035, < Q > becomes negative, i.e., we observe backﬂow. In fact, by doing parametric study we conclude that
tmC is the critical value of tm above which we observe backﬂow. By increasing tm further, tm = 10000.00, we note from
Fig.4 that in this deeply non-Newtonian regime < Q > becomes highly oscillatory, but what is unusual again is that
we observe the negative ﬂow rates for certain values of α that is the tube radius measured in wave-lengths. Obviously,
the negative < Q > means that ﬂow occurs in the direction opposite to the direction of propagation of traveling wave
on the tube wall. Oscillatory behavior (appearance of numerous of maxima in the behavior of a physical variable) in
the deeply non-Newtonian regime is not new [8]. However, the ﬂow of a ﬂuid created by the peristaltic mechanism
in the direction opposite to the direction of propagation of traveling wave is unusual and should be attributed to a
complicated, non-linear form of the response of a Maxwell ﬂuid to the stress exerted by the wave.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we investigated the dynamics of ﬂuid ﬂow in a tube with a circular cross-section, induced by a wave
traveling on its wall (boundary). This problem has numerous applications in various branches of science, including
stimulation of ﬂuid ﬂow in porous media under the eﬀect of elastic waves.

The present study investigates novelties brought about into the classic peristaltic mechanism by the inclusion of

non-Newtonian eﬀects based on the model of Maxwell ﬂuid.

We have found that in the extreme non-Newtonian regime there is a possibility of ﬂow in the direction opposite to
the propagation of the wave traveling on the tube wall. Somewhat similar eﬀect is known as the acoustic streaming [9],
in which an acoustic wave propagating in a tube induces a mean ﬂow in the direction of propagation in the acoustic

5

boundary layer, but in the opposite direction in the central part of the tube. The mean ﬂow or acoustic streaming is
caused by the presence of friction at the bounding surfaces of the tube. While ﬂuid away from the neighborhood of
a boundary vibrates irrotationally as the acoustic wave passes, ﬂuid in close proximity to the boundary must vibrate
rotationally to satisfy the no-slip condition on the tube wall. This deviation from inviscid, irrotational behavior
provides an eﬀective driving force known as the Reynolds stress. This eﬀective force, because of it is quadratic rather
than linear, has non-vanishing time-average tangential component to the tube wall that drives ﬂow in the boundary
layer. In the case considered in our paper instead of having acoustic wave propagating through the volume of the
tube, we have a wave traveling of the tube wall, besides we have further complication of considering non-Newtonian
(Maxwell) ﬂuid (recall that the discovered eﬀect is demonstrated for the case of non-Newtonian regime tm/tmC > 1.0).
Similarly, the peristaltic ﬂow itself is a second order non-linear eﬀect. Therefore, the ﬂow of a ﬂuid created by the
peristaltic mechanism in the direction opposite to the direction of propagation of traveling wave (i.e. back-ﬂow) could
be explained by a complicated, non-Newtonian, non-linear response of a Maxwell ﬂuid to the stress exerted by the
traveling wave.

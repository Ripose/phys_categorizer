Scaling of acceleration in locally isotropic turbulence

Reginald J. Hill
NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory, 325 Broadway, Boulder CO 80305, U.
S. A.
(July 25, 2013)

The variances of the ﬂuid-particle acceleration and of the pressure-gradient and viscous force
are given. The scaling parameters for these variances are velocity statistics measureable with a
single-wire anemometer. For both high and low Reynolds numbers, asymptotic scaling formulas are
given; these agree quantitatively with DNS data. Thus, the scaling can be presumed known for all
Reynolds numbers. Fluid-particle acceleration variance does not obey K41 scaling at any Reynolds
number; this is consistent with recent experimental data. The non-dimensional pressure-gradient
variance named λT /λP is shown to be obsolete.

pressure-gradient acceleration has as unobservably small eﬀect from intermittency as does D11.
In fact, pressure-
gradient statistics are strongly aﬀected by intermittency [Hill & Wilczak (1995, hereafter HW), Hill & Thoroddsen

(ﬁgures 12, 13 of VY). Since the advanced theories use only the Navier–Stokes equation, incompress-

(cid:10)
numerical limitations, or of inaccuracy of Taylor’s hypothesis (when used).

(cid:11)

Most studies of turbulent acceleration use the traditional approach of determining the Rλ dependence that
results from use of K41 scaling of acceleration statistics [e.g., VY, GR, GF, Antonia et al. (1999), La Porta et al.
(2001)]. The resultant deviation from K41 scaling, i.e. the Rλ dependence, is often called ’anomalous’. There is
no anomaly when the advanced theory is employed. Because Rλ contains urms, it is aﬀected by the large scales
where anisotropy is possible, and Rλ is therefore not a parameter of the advanced theory. However, to compare the
advanced theory with the existing body of empirical knowledge, the advanced-theory’s scales must be expressed in
terms of K41 scales, thereby producing dependence on Rλ and ε. However, K41 scaling parameters and Rλ are not
the scales within the advanced theory.

II. SCALING OF MEAN-SQUARED PRESSURE GRADIENT

For locally isotropic turbulence, HW gave the relationship between the mean-squared pressure gradient and

the fourth-order velocity structure function:

where χ is shorthand for the mean-squared pressure gradient for the case of local isotropy. In (1), D1111 (r), Dαααα (r),
and D11ββ (r) are components of Dijkl (r); α and β denote the Cartesian axes perpendicular to r, and the 1-axis is
parallel to r. Repeated Greek indices do not imply summation. The result (1) applies for all Reynolds numbers and
without approximation other than local isotropy.

Deﬁning Hχ as the ratio of the integral in (1) to its ﬁrst term, HW wrote (1) as

χ = 4Hχ

Equivalently, (2) deﬁnes Hχ. The purpose of (2) as stated in HW is that if the Reynolds number variation of
Hχ is known, then (2) enables evaluation of χ by calculating the integral in (2) using data from a single hot-wire
anemometer. Further, HW argued that Hχ is a constant at large Reynolds numbers. VY evaluated Hχ by means
of DNS data and found that it is constant at a value of about 0.65 for 80 < Rλ < 230, 230 being their maximum Rλ.

It is useful to express the integral in (2) in terms of quantities that have been measured in the past. On the

which is shown in ﬁgure 1 of VY. Neither (4) nor (3) is K41 scaling because of their Rλ dependence.

The data of Pearson & Antonia (2001) reveal how the approximation (3) is approached as Rλ increases. The
inner scale of D1111 (r) is denoted by ℓ and is deﬁned in Appendix A as the intersection of viscous- and inertial-range
asymptotic formulas for D1111 (r). Thus, ℓ is a length scale in the dissipation range.
In ﬁgures 4 and 5 of Pearson
& Antonia (2001), the scaled components of D1111 (r) increase most rapidly at r > ℓ as Rλ is increased until an
inertial range is attained. This implies that the integral in (2) will approach the asymptote (3) from below. That

has been observed, as shown in ﬁgure 1, wherein the DNS data of VY and GF are plotted with the asymptotic
formulas (3) and (4); those asymptotes are graphed to Rλ = 100 and 40, respectively. Because Hχ = 0.65 was
0.65 for 80 < Rλ < 230, it appears that Hχ remains
used in (3) to obtain ﬁgure 1, and because VY found Hχ ≃
constant at about 0.65 for Rλ > 80. There was no adjustment of (3) to cause agreement with the DNS. The
agreement is surprising because the empirical data used in Appendix A suggests at least a 15% uncertainty of the
15% error bar is shown at Rλ = 103 in ﬁgure
coeﬃcients in (3). As a reminder of this fortunate circumstance, a
/ε3/2ν−1/2 ∝ R1/2

Reynolds number; (3) is a reﬁnement of equation (59b) of HW. GR noted that equation (59b) gave a weaker
dependence on Rλ than their observed
λ dependence, found from DNS for which Rλ < 175. The reason is now
apparent from ﬁgure 1: Rλ < 175 is too low to use (3) or equation (59b) of HW. Figure 1 does not support the

IV. SCALING OF THE MEAN-SQUARED FLUID-PARTICLE ACCELERATION

For locally isotropic turbulence, the mean-squared ﬂuid-particle acceleration Aii (0) is χ + Vii (0) because the

At Rλ = 400, the term from χ is 70 times greater than the term from Vii (0), and χ increases much faster than Vii (0)
for increasing Rλ. The theory of 1948-1951 used the joint Gaussian assumption and thereby greatly underestimated
(HW, HT). That theory gives equation (3.18) of Obukhov & Yaglom (1951), which is the same as (11)

Reynolds numbers a dependence of λT /λP ∝ R

assumption. By attempting evaluation of λT /λP , Batchelor (1951) was, in eﬀect, attempting to enable determination
of χ from measurements of velocity variance and energy dissipation rate. The advanced theory replaces (λT /λP )2
with Hχ. Evaluation of Hχ allows χ to be determined from measurement of a single velocity component and the
simple formula (2). Figure 3 of GR shows λT /λP versus Rλ and reveals the following: i) the strong Rλ dependence
of λT /λP that Hχ does not have; ii) the deviation of the Rλ dependence of λT /λP from that predicted by the joint
Gaussian assumption; (this was also found by VY) and iii) Rλ < 20 is required to approach the low-Reynolds-number
asymptote. Whereas Hχ depends only on the small scales of turbulence, the dependence of λT /λP on the large scales
via urms shows that λT /λP is not relevant in the advanced theory of local isotropy, except in the limit of Rλ →
0;
for that limit HW shows that Hχ ∝ (λT /λP )2.

Pioneering technology for measuring turbulence accelerations is being developed at Cornell. La Porta et al.
(2001) report ﬂuid-particle acceleration measured in a cylindrical enclosure containing turbulent water driven by
counter-rotating blades. Here, ‘x’ and ‘y’ axes are transverse and parallel to their cylinder axis, respectively. The

/ε3/2ν−1/2 is monotonic with Rλ, unlike in
ﬁgure 4, where i = x and y ). From (11), Aii (0) /ε3/2ν−1/2 = 3
(cid:10)
ﬁgure 4 of La Porta et al. (2001). This suggests that the cause of the maxima in ﬂatness and variance have the same
cause. Their estimates of Rλ and ε both depend on the choice of a velocity component; because the turbulence is
anisotropic, the choice of another velocity component will shift their data points along both ordinate and abscissa.
This nonuniversality of their scaling is implicated by the disappearance of the maximum in the ﬂatness of ∂x1u1 as
presented by Belin et al. (1997) when Rλ is replaced by a universal Reynolds number (Hill, 2001). Belin et al.
(1997) measure near one counter-rotating blade whereas LaPorta et al. (2001) measure in the ﬂow’s center. The two
measured by
cylinders have diﬀerent aspect ratios. It is nevertheless instructive to substitute the values of F and
Belin et al. (1997) into (11), divide by 3 to obtain the variance of one component of acceleration, and compare the
result with the data of La Porta et al. (2001). This is done in ﬁgure 2, wherein the data of VY and GF are shown
to agree with the data of Belin et al. (1997). For the Belin et al. data, (11) produces a maximum similar to that of
the La Porta et al. (2001) data.

FIG. 2. Figure 2 K41 scaled mean-squared acceleration component. La Porta et al. (2001) data, x-component: asterisks;
y-component: squares; Belin et al. (1997) data in equation (11): diamonds; combined DNS data of VY and GF: triangles;
eq.(4.3) divided by 3: solid line.

As Belin et al. (1997) point out, the maximum in their data for F might be speciﬁc to the ﬂow between counter-
rotating blades. If so, the same is likely true of the data of La Porta et al. (2001) such that their data do not support
K41 scaling of acceleration, and therefore do not contradict the advanced theory. Another possibility is that the data
of LaPorta et al. (2001) at Rλ = 970 is underestimated for unknown reasons. The conclusion suggested by ﬁgure
2 and the above uncertainties in interpretation of the data is that the data supports the scaling given here and that
such important acceleration measurements must continue.

The advanced theory is devoid of statistics of the large scales.

It seems paradoxical that Rλ, which depends
on the large scales through urms, is used above to delineate asymptotic regimes. However, an alternative Reynolds
number that depends only on small scales (Hill, 2001) makes the advanced theory self-contained. Use of existing
phenomenology caused both ε and Rλ to appear in this paper. However, practical applications result. Turbulent
acceleration-induced coalescence of droplets might be key to understanding rain initiation from liquid-water clouds

The lognormal model of Kolmogorov (1962) is used here; the result is found to be insensitive to the in-
termittency model used. The inertial range formulas are: D1111 (r) = C′ε4/3rqL2µ/9, q = (4/3)
(2µ/9), and
D11 (r) = Cε2/3rpL−µ/9, p = (2/3) + (µ/9); L is the integral scale; µ = 0.25 is used (Sreenivasan & Kailasnath,
r4
1993), as is C = 2 (Sreenivasan, 1995). Viscous-range formulas are used; they are: D1111 (r) =

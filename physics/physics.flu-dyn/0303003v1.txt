Experimental Lagrangian Acceleration
Probability Density Function Measurement

Abstract

We report experimental results on the acceleration component probability distribu-
tion function at Rλ = 690 to probabilities of less than 10−7. This is an improve-
ment of more than an order of magnitude over past measurements and allows us
to conclude that the fourth moment converges and the ﬂatness is approximately
55. We compare our probability distribution to those predicted by several models
inspired by non-extensive statistical mechanics. We also look at acceleration compo-
nent probability distributions conditioned on a velocity component for conditioning
velocities as high as 3 times the standard deviation and ﬁnd them to be highly
non-Gaussian.

1 Introduction

Recent developments of new experimental techniques have allowed signiﬁcant
progress in the Lagrangian description of turbulence [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Although
this aspect has been investigated theoretically since the beginning of the
20th century, the extreme diﬃculty of recording particle trajectories in high
Reynolds number turbulence restricted experimental investigations. The avail-
ability of very high speed imaging sensors gives access to the Lagrangian accel-
eration in fully developed turbulence. It has been shown that the probability
density function (PDF) of a Lagrangian acceleration component is strongly
non-Gaussian, i.e., the PDF exhibits extremely large tails [1,3]. This has been
also observed in direct numerical simulations of fully developed turbulence [7,8]

These observations resemble features obtained in the ﬁeld of non-extensive
statistical mechanics [9,10,11,12]. This opens two promising perspectives: ﬁrst
toward a statistical theory of turbulence and second toward a dynamical mod-
eling of the motion of ﬂuid particles. The latter comes from the theoretical link
ﬁrst established by C. Beck [9] between the Tsallis entropy and a stochastic

equation for the Lagrangian acceleration. These developments led to a series of
models for the PDF of Lagrangian accelerations. The multitude of models need
to be tested by an accurate comparison with experimental data, especially in
the low probability tails of the acceleration PDF.

Here we present new experimental results that have allowed us to improve
the estimation of the acceleration PDF. First we describe the modiﬁcations
that have been implemented on the previous experiment, then we show the
acceleration PDF and compare it to the diﬀerent classes of models. Finally we
show and discuss some PDF’s of acceleration conditioned on velocity which
are improvements over results presented previously in Sawford et al. [13].

2 The experiment

The experimental set-up has been described in detail in previous publica-
tions [1,2,3]. The reader should refer to these for detailed information on the
experiment. Let us recall brieﬂy the main features. The ﬂow under consider-
ation is of the Von K´arm´an kind: the water is driven by two counter-rotating
disks, 20 cm in diameter, 33 cm apart, mounted in a cylindrical container.
The rotation frequency of the disks is regulated at 3.5 Hz for the experiment
under consideration here. The integral scale of the ﬂow has been shown to
be 7 cm and the energy dissipation rate to be 1.14 m2s−3 [1]. The transverse
and axial spatial coordinates of small tracer particles (diameter 46 µm, den-
sity ρ = 1.06g/cm3) are recorded by two silicon strip detectors. Each detector
provides a 1D recording of the particle trajectories at a sampling rate up to
70 kHz. The root-mean-square velocity is 0.43 ms−1, so that the Taylor based
Reynolds number is 690. The Kolmogorov time is τη = 0.93 ms, the sam-
pling frequency is Fs = 69.9 kHz so that τη corresponds to 65 samples. We
study here only one transverse component of the acceleration. Even though
the velocity components have been shown to be anisotropic, the acceleration
components are close to isotropic at that Reynolds number [1].

Compared to the experiment reported earlier, we are now able to record data
three time faster (in terms of global eﬃciency, i.e., including transfer rate from
the digitizer to the computer, repetition rate, etc.) because of a hardware up-
grade of the data-acquisition computers. This allowed us to obtain more data
in a reasonable time. The laser used for illumination has also been upgraded
to a frequency doubled pulsed YAG laser with mean output power as high as
35 watts, a typical pulse duration of 200 ns and a pulse repetition rate of up to
70 kHz. This pulsed laser improves the eﬃciency of the silicon strip detectors
due to the short duration of the pulses.

Another diﬀerence lies in the signal processing. As stressed in Voth et al. [1],

2

one has to low-pass ﬁlter the trajectories to ﬁlter the noise in order to have
access to the acceleration. In our previous work [1,3], the ﬁltering and diﬀer-
entiation were achieved by ﬁtting a parabola to the data, in a time window
whose duration had to be appropriately chosen. Here, this procedure has been
modiﬁed to improve the performance of the data processing algorithm. We
now use a diﬀerentiating and ﬁltering kernel k(τ ) so that the acceleration is
obtained by convolution a = k ⋆ x, where ⋆ is the convolution product and x
is the spatial coordinate of the particle. We have chosen a Gaussian kernel

g(τ ) =

1
√πw2 exp

.

!

To achieve both a low pass ﬁlter and the second order diﬀerentiation of tra-
jectories, one simply has to diﬀerentiate twice the Gaussian kernel

k(τ ) =

In practice, however, time is discrete and one has to use a ﬁnite time win-
dow, therefore the kernel is truncated. This requires a modiﬁcation of the
normalization. The following kernel was used in the data analysis (for discrete
times):

where A and B are normalization constants chosen to ensure that k ⋆ 1 = 0
and k ⋆ τ 2 = 2, i.e., the second derivative of a constant is 0 and the second
derivative of a parabola is 2. Note that, if L equals one time sample 1/Fs, one
recovers the simple 3 points discrete second derivative (independently of the
value of w). If L
1/Fs one converges to the continuous kernel g when
Fs goes to inﬁnity. The results obtained from the ﬁltering operation are found
to be in agreement with those obtained by the parabolic ﬁtting procedure.
Note that due to the truncation, the actual width of the ﬁlter is a slightly
lower that w.

3.1 Experimental estimation of the PDF

The results presented here required continuous acquisition of data for two
weeks. The data set consists of 1.7 108 points, which include the new mea-
surements and the data reported in the previous publications [1,3]. The ex-
perimental probability density function (PDF) is presented in Fig. 1 as dots.
The new data allows the estimation of the PDF to reach probabilities more
than one order of magnitude lower than the results in [1,3], i.e., less than 10−7.

proposed earlier [1,3], with slightly diﬀerent values due to improved accuracy
of the ﬁt and perhaps also a diﬀerence in the Reynolds number. The initial
values were β = 0.539, γ = 1.588, σ = 0.508 at Rλ = 970. This stretched
exponential ﬁt is shown to follow the experimental data very well.

One consequence of our better estimation of the acceleration PDF is that we
can conclude that the fourth moment converges. Fig. 3 displays the contribu-
tion to the fourth moment: a4P (a). The ﬁrst observation is that this function
increases. From our ﬁt, the decay is consistent with a stretched

3.2 Comparison with models inspired by non-extensive statistical mechanics

Among the large class of superstatistics [14], four speciﬁc examples have been
proposed to model the observed acceleration PDF. The ﬁrst one, proposed
by C. Beck [9] (and referred to as Beck-χ2 here after), is based on the χ2-
distribution. One very interesting feature of this analysis is the possibility of
making a connection between a statistical approach and a dynamical approach.
It allows us to build a stochastic equation for the Lagrangian time dynamics
of acceleration. In the same spirit, A. M. Reynolds [11] and then C. Beck [12]
proposed a second model (referred as Reynolds and Beck-Log resp.) based
on log-normal statistics. The approach of Reynolds is much more ambitious.
He tries to build a full stochastic equation that models the acceleration. This
model takes into account not only the small time scales dynamics but also
the large scales. He takes all numerical parameters from experiments or direct
numerical simulations reported in the literature. Therefore there is no free
parameters in his model, once the Reynolds number is chosen. Thus the result
of the model is not a ﬁt to the experimental data.

Another more classical approach has been proposed by T. Arimitsu and N.
Arimitsu [10] (referred as Arimitsu). They use the properties of scale invari-
ance of the Navier-Stokes equation to build a multifractal description of the
acceleration PDF.

These four models are displayed in ﬁgures 4 and 5 together with the experi-
mental data. The ﬁrst obvious observation is that the χ2-distribution model
(with q = 3/2) does not ﬁt the data. The decay of the tails displays qualita-
tively incorrect behavior. Indeed, for any value of the parameter q, the model
predicts a power-law decay which is not observed. For q close to 3/2, which
gives the best ﬁt, the fourth moment diverges which is not the case for the
experimental data. The modiﬁcation of the distribution to log-normal, intro-
duced later by C. Beck, makes the ﬁt qualitatively much better. In particular
the ﬂatness, for s2 = 3.0 takes a ﬁnite value F = 60.3. The Reynolds model

does not agree as well to the data as the other ones. One reason is that there
are no free parameters in this model. Second, we low-pass ﬁlter the acceleration
at the scale 0.17τη. This scale is small but not zero. If one takes the temporal
position signals from the Reynolds model and low-pass ﬁlter them at the same
scale then the overlapping with the experimental data is highly improved [15].
The multifractal model by Arimitsu also provides a good agreement with the
experimental results.

For all these models the departure to the experimental curve is best viewed
in Fig. 5. Most of the proposed models do not peak at the same value of
acceleration as the experimental curve. Nevertheless most of them are very
close to the experiment.

Conditional acceleration statistics are important in many second order stochas-
tic models [11,13,16,17,18]. A very large number of statistics is required to ob-

tain acceleration PDF’s conditional on large velocities since large velocities are
rare events. The new large data set allowed us to calculate distributions con-
ditional on larger velocities than those shown in Sawford et. al. [13]. Figure 6
shows PDF’s of the transverse component of acceleration conditional on the
transverse component of velocity. The conditional probability distributions are
highly non-Gaussian. They have almost the same shape as the unconditional
distribution. The conditional acceleration variance increases with increasing
velocity which seems to be due mainly to a widening of the tip of the distri-
bution as can be see in in Figure 6. For homogeneous isotropic turbulence the
conditional mean acceleration should be zero. Departures from zero reﬂect the
anisotropy of our ﬂow although DNS of homogeneous isotropic turbulence has
also shown slight departures from zero [13]. Sawford et. al. present a scaling
argument that indicates that the conditional acceleration component variance

ment with this. The dependence of acceleration distributions on the velocity
violates local homogeneity [19] which is an assumption of Kolmogorov 41 the-
ory.

4 Conclusion

Our new set of data helps to discriminate among diﬀerent classes of models.
In particular, the model based on the Tsallis entropy is shown to disagree
with the experimental observations: the acceleration PDF does not display
any power law decrease and is well ﬁtted by a stretched exponential decay.
One consequence is that the fourth moment of the acceleration component is
ﬁnite and we observe a value of the ﬂatness close to 55. The models based on
log-normal statistics proposed by Beck and Reynolds or multifractal analysis
(Arimitsu) are indeed close to our experimental observations.

We also show that the joint PDF of acceleration and velocity is not gaus-
sian. The acceleration variance conditioned on velocity is also non constant.
These results have important consequences on the structure of the stochastic
equation required to model dispersion by turbulent ﬂows.

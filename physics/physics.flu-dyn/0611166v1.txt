For certain families of ﬂuid ﬂow, a new conserved quantity – stream-helicity – has been established.
Using examples of linked and knotted streamtubes, it has been shown that stream-helicity does, in
certain cases, entertain itself with a very precise topological meaning viz., measure of the degree
of knottedness or linkage of streamtubes. As a consequence, stream-helicity emerges as a robust
topological invariant.

INTRODUCTION

II. STREAM-HELICITY

Lord Kelvin (who alongwith Helmholtz pioneered in
the subject of vortex motion) had recognised in the late
19th century that in an inviscid and barotropic ﬂuid be-
ing acted upon by irrotational body forces, any linkage or
any knottedness in the vorticity ﬁeld at any earlier time
should remain conserved at all later times. After almost
hundred years, Moreau[1] and later Moﬀatt[2] established
an invariant known as helicity which is of topological
character and encompasses Kelvin’s insight. Stark anal-
ogy between vorticity (~ω) in ordinary ﬂuid dynamics and
magnetic ﬁeld ( ~B) in magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD)
prompted Moﬀatt to give similar topological interpreta-
tions to magnetic helicity and cross-helicity (which, by
the way, measures the degree of ‘mutual’ knottedness of
two the ﬁelds: ~ω and ~B). By now, obviously, a nat-
ural bridge between topology and ﬂuids had been well
established. But what lord Kelvin had missed was the
possible existence of knotted streamtubes in the steady
Euler ﬂows, a fact very logically speculated by Moﬀatt[3].
Not much has been done on that. Here, in this paper, in-
spired by the works of Moﬀatt, we shall introduce in sec-
tion (II) a quantity, which we shall call ‘stream-helicity’
(S) in inviscid and incompressible ﬂuid being forced by
irrotational body forces. It will be shown that stream-
helicity is a conserved quantity under certain restrictions
which are not, of course, very rare in practice. In section
(III), we shall note how this conserved quantity can have
a very sound topological meaning for at least some kinds
of ﬂows and hence, how stream-helicity can be raised to
the status of a topological invariant for linked and knot-
ted streamtubes.

Let us start with the Euler equation (equation (1))
for three-dimensional, inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid being
acted upon by irrotational body forces. P used in the
equation includes the eﬀect of such forces also. Since the
ﬂuid is incompressible, i.e., the density is constant, we
are taking the density to be unity for convenience.

∂
∂t

~u + (~u.~∇)~u = −~∇P

Incompressibility yields for the velocity ﬁeld ~u:

which helps in deﬁning the vector potential ~ξ for the ve-
locity ﬁeld as follows:

~∇.~u = 0

~u = ~∇ × ~ξ

Putting relation (3) in the equation (1), we get:

(~∇ × ~ξ) + (~u.~∇)(~∇ × ~ξ) = −~∇P

∂
∂t

But we have:

[~∇ × (~u.~∇)~ξ]i = ǫijk∂j (ul∂lξk)

= ǫijk(∂j ul)(∂lξk) + ǫijkul∂j∂lξk
= ǫijk(∂j ul)(∂lξk) + [(~u.~∇)(~∇ × ~ξ)]i(5)

Using relation (5) in the equation (4) we get:

∂
∂t

(~∇ × ~ξ) + ~∇ × {(~u.~∇)~ξ} = ǫijk(∂jul)(∂lξk) − ~∇P

~ξ + (~u.~∇)~ξ = curl

−1~η

∂
∂t

where ~η is deﬁned as:

~η ≡ ǫijk(∂j ul)(∂lξk) − ~∇P

Now, let us deﬁne ‘stream-helicity’ (S) as:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(6)

(7)

(8)

S ≡

~ξ.~ud3x

ZV

where V is a volume occupied by the ﬂuid and may be
moving with the ﬂuid. Now, we wish to demonstrate
that under certain restrictions this quantity is in fact
conserved. So, we take total derivative of S w.r.t. time
to get:

D
Dt

(~ξ.~u)d3x

dS
dt
dS
dt

⇒

=

=

Z

Z

Z

~ξ.(−~∇P )d3x +

~u.(curl

−1~η)d3x (9)

where, D/Dt is the material derivative w.r.t. time and
it basically is a shorthand for ∂/∂t + ~u.~∇. Again, simple
vector algebra suggests:

(~∇ × ~ξ).(curl

−1~η) = ~∇.(~ξ × curl

−1~η) + ~η.~ξ

(10)

With relation (3) in mind, inserting relation (10) in the
equation (9), we have the following:

dS
dt

= −2

~ξ.~∇P d3x +

~∇.(~ξ × curl

−1~η)d3x

+

ξi∂l(ǫijkξk∂jul)d3x

Z

Z

Z

where, equation (2) has been used. The ﬁrst two terms
of the equation (11) can be changed to integration over
the surface which bounds the volume V in question (the
surface will obviously extend to inﬁnity if the ﬂuid is
unbounded) using Gauss divergence theorem and so if ~ξ
decays fast enough to go to zero on the bounding surface
then these two term vanish. Now, let us consider the
third term. If this term vanishes then only one may set

dS
dt

= 0

and say that stream-helicity is a conserved quantity.
Though it seems to be very restrictive, but one can see
that in the following commonly occurring cases the inte-
grand of this term trivially vanishes.

• The vector potential is one dimensional.

• The vector potential has no dependence on the di-
rection along the vector ﬁeld.
(Other conditions
given below are basically this condition’s corollary.)

• ~ξ is two dimensional but has dependence only on

the third direction.

• ~ξ is two dimensional with spatial variations only on

the plane containing it.

• ~ξ is three dimensional but depends only on any one

of the three independent directions.

So, for the families of ﬂuid ﬂow for which the vector po-
tential falls into the above set, the equation (12) holds
and stream-helicity is a conserved quantity. Also, for the
ﬂuid ﬂows for which doesn’t fall in the above set but the
integration goes to zero some reason or the other (which
has not been investigated), S will remain conserved.

III. TOPOLOGICAL MEANING OF
STREAM-HELICITY

(11)

(12)

Now, we ask the question if it is possible to give stream-
helicity a topological meaning and more importantly, can
that topological meaning turn out to be a topological in-
variant. We shall see that the answer is in aﬃrmative.
To get both of the expectations met, one (other uninves-
tigated possibilities may also be there) of the ways seems
to be the following:
Consider two circular thin streamtubes which are singly-
linked and for the two tubes the ‘strengths’ are VC1 and
VC2 respectively, where C1 and C2 denote axis-circles of
the corresponding tubes. By ‘strengths’ we mean that
VC1 = ~u.d~a1 and VC2 = ~u.d~a2. (See FIG-1). Again, we
assume that the velocity ﬁeld, we shall be dealing with,
is generated by a vector potential ~ξ which is a Beltrami
ﬁeld i.e.,

~u = ~∇ × ~ξ = α~ξ

(13)

where, α is a numerical constant. Moreover, suppose that
of the conditions gathered in the previous section for ~ξ,
at least one is applicable, say the second one that:

(~u.~∇)~ξ = ~0

(14)

whether this is possible or not may be a valid question.
One may derive ‘some’ relief from the fact that if ~ξ is anal-
ogous to ABC ﬂow (Gromeka(1881); Beltrami(1889)),
then it does satisfy such condition though unfortunately
it may not sustain a linked structure of streamtubes.
Then the streamtubes will be made up of streamlines
which are coincident with the ‘ﬂux-lines’ of ~ξ ﬁeld.
If we deﬁne the volume over which the integration is de-
ﬁned for the stream-helicty to be the volume occupied by

the linked structure only, then

S ≡

~ξ.~ud3x =

Z

~ξ.~ud3x +

Z Z Z1st Streamtube
~ξ.~ud3x

Z Z Z2nd Streamtube
~ξ.d~l1 + VC2

⇒ S = VC1

~ξ.d~l2

⇒ S = VC1

ZC1

ZC2
~u.d~σ + VC2

Z ZDC1

Z ZDC2

⇒ S = VC1 VC2 + VC1VC2
⇒ S = 2VC1VC2

~u.d~σ

(15)

where in the preceding steps we have used ~ud3x →
VC1 d~l1, VC2 d~l2 on C1 and C2 respectively; DC1 and DC2
denote the area spanned by C1 and C2 respectively. Ob-
viously, if the linking number is n and not one as in this
case, one would easily generalise the result to:

S = 2nVC1VC2

(16)

which, being dependent on the mutual linking of stream-
tubes, is a topological quantity. One may write from
equation (11) using Gauss divergence theorem in the fol-
lowing form:

dS
dt

= −2

(~ξ.ˆn)~∇P d2x +

(curl

−1~η).(ˆn × ~ξ)d2x

+

ξi∂l(ǫijkξk∂jul)d3x

Z

Z

Z

(17)

where ˆn is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface
at each point on the surface of the linked structure. The
ﬁrst term and the third terms of the equation (17) are
zero in this case by construction of the linked structure;
so is the second term but it needs a bit of manipulation
as explained below.
First of all, we use equation (6), to rewrite the integrand
of the second term of the relation (17) as

∂~ξ
∂t

"

+ (~u.~∇)~ξ
#

.(ˆn × ~ξ) = ǫijknjξk

+ (ul∂l)ξi

∂ξi
∂t

(cid:20)

(18)
(cid:21)

Now, if we consider the Frenet-Serret coordinate system:
( ~T , ~N , ~B), then in the case we are considering ~ξ/|~ξ| = ~T
and ˆn = ~N ; obviously on the surface of the speciﬁc tube
we are considering, at each point, the triad so that there
ξ2 = ξ3 = 0 and n1 = n3 = 0 and hence due to the
antisymmetry of ǫijk we have :

(curl

−1η).(ˆn × ~ξ) = 0

So, obviously we land up on the following relation:

dS
dt

= 0

Therefore, for incompressible, ideal and conservatively
forced ﬂuid ﬂow, in certain conﬁgurations, we can have a

3

topological invariant – stream-helicity – for linked struc-
tures of streamtubes.
So far so good. So, stream-helicty does seem to make
physical sense for linked two (or more) streamtubes. But
what if a single streamtube is knotted? A single knotted
streamtube must have an unavoidable twist of velocity
ﬁeld (which we hope, in this case also, may be derived
from a Beltrami velocity vector potential and is of similar
kind as has been dealt with earlier in this paper) within
the tube. How to deal with such a senario has been dis-
cussed for knotted vortex ﬁlaments by Moﬀatt[4]. We
know when an arbitrary tame knot is viewed in a stan-
dard plane of projection with ﬁnite number of crossings,
each of which is either positive or negative, it can be
changed to a unknot (and ergo, subsequently continously
deformed to a circle) by switching the crossings for a ﬁ-
nite number of times. (To remind the readers, a crossing
is deﬁned as positive or negative according as the over-
pass must be rotated counter-clockwise or clockwise to
bring it into coincidence with the underpass.) One may
note that the resulting circle may be converted back to
the original knot simple by performing the operations in
the reverse order. With this in mind, let us consider a
tubular region with the circle as axis. The cross-section
of the tube is small and over that the velocity of ﬁeld,
which we suppose is ﬁlling the tube with strength V , is
uniform; each streamline is, of course, a concentric circle
to the circle serving as the axis. Now, let us transversely
cut the tube somewhere and reconnect it back after giv-
ing it a twist through an angle 2πN (where, N is an
integer). This way we are introducing a stream-helicity
of magnitude N V 2. Then by introducing proper switch-
ing loops with similar strength, this construction may be
changed to a knot with stream-helicity:

S = [N + 2(n+ − n−)]V 2

(21)

where, n+ and n− are respectively the number of positive
and negative switches needed to create the knot whose
stream-helicty we are interested in. One may prove that
N + 2(n+ − n−) is actually the linking number of any
pair of streamlines in the knotted streamtube.
It also
is the self-linking number of the ‘framed’ knot which is
‘framed’ using Frenet-Serret coordinate system[5]. Point
to be noted is that for the kind of velocity ﬁeld we are
discussing S will remain conserved and hence emerges as
a topological invariant, for, evidently S depends on the
topology of the knotted streamtube.

IV. CONCLUSION

(19)

(20)

To summarise, a new conserved quantity – stream-
helicity – has been found (albeit, in a restricted sense) in
ﬂuid dynamics. By seeking a topological interpretation
for it in the certain conﬁgurations of linked and knotted
streamtubes, the bridge between topology and ﬂuid
dynamics has been made even stronger.
In addition,
as a byproduct, the seemingly non-physical quantity

– velocity vector potential – has given itself a sort of
physical meaning by getting involved in measuring the
degree of knottedness of streamtubes.

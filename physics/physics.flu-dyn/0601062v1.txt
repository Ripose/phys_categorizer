We use direct and stochastic numerical simulations of the magnetohydrodynamic equations to ex-
plore the inﬂuence of turbulence on the dynamo threshold. In the spirit of the Kraichnan-Kazantsev
model, we model the turbulence by a noise, with given amplitude, injection scale and correlation
time. The addition of a stochastic noise to the mean velocity signiﬁcantly alters the dynamo thresh-
old. When the noise is at small (resp.
large) scale, the dynamo threshold is decreased (resp.
increased). For a large scale noise, a ﬁnite noise correlation time reinforces this eﬀect.

The process of magnetic ﬁeld generation through the
movement of an electrically conducting medium is called
a dynamo. When this medium is a ﬂuid, the instability
results from a competition between magnetic ﬁeld ampli-
ﬁcation via stretching and folding, and damping through
magnetic diﬀusion. This is quantiﬁed by the magnetic
Reynolds number Rm, which must exceed some criti-
cal value Rmc for the instability to operate. Despite
their obvious relevance in natural objects, such as stars,
planets or galaxies, dynamos are not so easy to study
or model. Computer resources limit the numerical study
of dynamos to a range of either small Reynolds num-
bers Re (laminar dynamo), modest Rm and Re [1] or
small P m = Rm/Re using Large Eddy Simulation [2].
These diﬃculties explain the recent development of ex-
periments involving liquid metals, as a way to study the
dynamo problem at large Reynolds number. In this case,
the ﬂow has a non-zero mean component and is fully tur-
bulent. There is, in general, no exact analytical or numer-
ical predictions regarding the dynamo threshold. How-
ever, prediction for the mean ﬂow action can be obtained
in the so-called ”kinematic regime” where the magnetic
ﬁeld back reaction onto the ﬂow is neglected (see e.g.
[3]). This approximation is very useful when conduct-
ing optimization of experiments, so as to get the lowest
threshold for dynamo action based only on the mean ﬂow
RmMF
[4, 5, 6, 7]. It led to very good estimate of the
c
measured dynamo threshold in the case of experiments
in constrained geometries [8], where the instantaneous
velocity ﬁeld is very close to its time-average.

In contrast, unconstrained experiments [7, 9] are char-
acterized by large velocity ﬂuctuations, allowing the ex-
ploration of the inﬂuence of turbulence onto the mean-
ﬂow dynamo threshold. Theoretical predictions regard-
ing this inﬂuence are scarce. Small velocity ﬂuctua-
tions produce little impact on the dynamo threshold [10].
Predictions for arbitrary ﬂuctuation amplitudes can be
reached by considering the turbulent dynamo as an in-
stability (driven by the mean ﬂow) in the presence of a
multiplicative noise (turbulent ﬂuctuations) [11]. In this

context, ﬂuctuations favor or impede the magnetic ﬁeld
growth depending on their intensity or correlation time.
This observation is conﬁrmed by recent numerical simu-
lations of simple periodic ﬂows with non-zero mean ﬂow
[12, 13] showing that turbulence increases the dynamo
threshold.

In the sequel we use direct and stochastic numerical
simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equa-
tions to explore a possible explanation, linked with the
existence of non-stationarity of the largest scales. We
found that the addition of a stochastic noise to the mean
velocity could signiﬁcantly alter the dynamo threshold.
When the noise is at small scale, the dynamo threshold
is decreased, while it is increased for a large scale noise.
In the latter case, the noise correlation time plays a role,
and reinforces this eﬀect, as soon as it is larger than the
mean eddy turnover time. When interpreted within the
Kraichnan-Kazantsev model of MHD ﬂow, these results
predict that large scale (resp.
small scale) turbulence
inhibits (resp. favors) dynamo action.

a triply periodic cubic domain using a pseudo-spectral
method. The aliasing is removed by setting the solution
of the 1/3 largest modes to zero. The time marching is
done using a second-order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme. An
Adams-Bashforth scheme is used for the nonlinear terms
while the dissipative terms are integrated exactly. The
two control parameters are the Reynolds number Re =
vrmslint/ν and the magnetic Reynolds number Rm =
vrmslint/η, where vrms = (1/3)√2E = (1/3)√< u2 > is

ber Reexp = vmaxπ/ν (usually used in experiments)

up to 2563 ;
ii) LES-MHD, where the Lesieur-Chollet
model of turbulence is used for the velocity equation (1-
a), allowing to explore a case out-of-reach of DNS [12],
namely Re = 500, 5
100; iii) kinematic sim-
ulations ; iv) kinematic-stochastic (KS) simulations. In
these last two cases, only the induction equation (1-b)
is integrated with u set to a given velocity ﬁeld. In the
kinematic case, it corresponds to the stationary velocity
ﬁeld u(Re) obtained through time-average of a stable so-
lution of the Navier-Stokes equations with Taylor-Green
forcing, at ﬁxed Reynolds number. This procedure is
complicated by the presence of hydrodynamic instabili-
ties at low Reynolds number [14], which impose very long
simulation time (typically over 1000 s, i.e. 400 eddy turn
over times at Re = 46) to ensure convergence towards an
asymptotically stable solution. The average is then per-
formed over several (typically 200) eddy-turnover times.
In the KS case, the velocity ﬁeld u = u(Re) + v′(kI , τc)
is the sum of a time averaged velocity ﬁeld at a given Re
and of an external Markovian Gaussian noise, with ﬁxed
amplitude v′, correlation time τc and typical scale kI . In
both kinematic simulations, the magnetic Reynolds num-
ber Rm is computed by using the rms velocity and inte-
gral scale of u. In the deterministic case, this amounts
to use Vrms = (1/3)√< u2 > and Lint the (spatial) rms
velocity and integral scale of the time-averaged velocity
ﬁeld, therefore respecting the experimental procedure fol-
lowed in optimization of dynamo experiments [4, 5, 6, 7].
For each type of simulation, we ﬁx Re ( v′, τc and kI , if
needed), vary Rm and monitor the time behavior of the
magnetic energy < B2 > and the ﬁnite-time Lyapunov
exponent Λ = 0.5 ∂t < ln(B2) >, where the average is
taken over the spatial domain. Three types of behaviors
are typically observed [14]: i) no dynamo : the magnetic
energy decays, the Lyapunov converges towards a ﬁnite
negative value; ii) undecided state : the magnetic en-
ergy remains at a low level, with intermittent bursts of
magnetic energy [15] and oscillation of the Lyapunov, so
that no ﬁt of the Lyapunov exponent can be obtained;
iii) turbulent dynamo : the magnetic energy grows with
positive Lyapunov, and, in the DNS-MHD or LES-MHD,
reaches a nonlinear saturated regime.

From the values of the Lyapunov in the turbulent dy-

2

namo and no dynamo regime, one may derive the crit-
ical magnetic Reynolds number Rmc(Re), solution of
Λ(Re, Rmc) = 0, through a standard interpolation pro-
cedure.

A summary of our exploration of the parameter space
is provided in Fig. 1, for the non-stochastic simulations,
where the only control parameters are Rm and Re. We
did not detect any dynamo at Re = 2. Between Re = 4
and Re = 6, we observed heterocline dynamos, oscillating
between a non-dynamo and a dynamo state. The win-
dow 2 < Re < 4 has been studied in [12], where decreas-
ing critical magnetic Reynolds number has been found.
For 4 < Re < 100, we found that the critical magnetic
Reynolds number for dynamo action in a turbulent ﬂow
Rmturb
increases with the Reynolds number, in quanti-
c
tative agreement with the result obtained in the same
geometry, but with a diﬀerent forcing (at constant force
instead of constant velocity) [12]. Our LES-MHD simu-
lation conﬁrms the saturation of the dynamo threshold
at large Reynolds number already observed in constant
force simulations [12]. For the mean ﬂow, we have actu-
ally detected at least two windows of dynamo actions :
one, independent of Re, starting above RmMF
6 and
centered around Rm = 10, with real Lyapunov (station-
ary dynamo); a second, occurring at larger Rm, varying
with Re, with complex Lyapunov (oscillatory dynamo).
One sees that Rmturb
varies across these two windows
and always exceeds RmMF
. In the sequel, we show that
the increase and saturation of Rmturb
is not due to a
crossing between the two dynamo modes, but to the in-
ﬂuence of non-stationary large scales over RmMF

slightly tilted downwards, while they are lifted upwards
in the case of large scale noise (kI = 1). The inﬂuence of
the noise onto the ﬁrst dynamo bifurcation (the dynamo
threshold) can be summarized by plotting the critical
magnetic Reynolds numbers as a function of the noise
intensity (Fig. 4-a). Large scale (resp. small-scale) noise
tends to increase (resp. decrease) the dynamo thresh-
old. Furthermore, one sees that for small scale noise, the
decrease in the dynamo threshold is almost independent
of the noise correlation time τc, while for the large scale
noise, the increase is proportional to τc at small τc. At
τc & 1 sec-one third of the mean eddy-turnover time-, all
curves Rmc(δ) collapse onto the same curve. We have
further investigated this behavior to understand its ori-
gin.
Increasing δ ﬁrst increases of the ﬂow turbulent
viscosity vrmslint with respect to its mean ﬂow value
VrmsLint. This eﬀect can be corrected by considering
Rm∗
c = RmcVrmsLint/vrmslint. Second, an increase of
δ produces an increase of the ﬂuctuations of kinetic en-

ergy, quantiﬁed by δ2 = q< u2 >2
/< u2 >.
This last eﬀect is more pronounced at kI = 1 than at
kI = 16. It is ampliﬁed through increasing noise correla-
tion time. We thus re-analyzed our data by plotting Rm∗
c
as a function of δ2 (Fig. 4-b). All results tend to collapse
onto a single curve, independently of the noise injection
scale and correlation time. This curve tends to a con-
stant equal to RmMF
at low δ2. This means that the
magnetic diﬀusivity needed to achieved dynamo action
in the mean ﬂow is not aﬀected by spatial velocity ﬂuc-
tuations. This is achieved for small scale noise, or large
scale noise with small correlation time scale. In contrast,

time and characteristic scale, and need to be computed
for each stochastic simulation. It can also be computed
in the direct simulations, and is found to depend onto
the Reynolds number, increasing from a value of 1 at low
Reynolds number, until about 3 at the largest available
Reynolds number (Figure 2-a). Note that δ
1 is just
the ratio of the kinetic energy of ﬂuctuations onto the
kinetic energy of the mean ﬂow. In the sequel, the com-
parison between the KS and DNS-MHD simulations will
therefore be made using δ as the control parameter. An-
other interesting information can be obtained from the
energy spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld, as one averages over
longer and longer time scales (Figure 2-b). One sees that
during the ﬁrst period of average (typically, a few eddy
turn-over time, i.e. about 5 to 10 s), one mainly removes
the ﬂuctuations at largest scales, while the remaining av-
erage mostly removes small scales (over time scales of the
order of 50 to 100 eddy-turnover times, i.e. 300 s).

In the sequel, we explore the inﬂuence of both type
of ﬂuctuations through the KS simulations, by consider-
ing noise at large (kI = 1) and small scale (kI = 16),
with correlation time ranging from 0 to 50 s. Since the
kinematic dynamo threshold is essentially constant for
all values of the Reynolds number we explored, we ﬁrst
focus on the study of the case where the time-averaged
ﬁeld is ﬁxed as u(Re = 6) and vary the noise ampli-
tude, characteristic scale or correlation time, to explore
their inﬂuence on the dynamo threshold. An example
of our exploration of the parameter space is provided
in Figure 3, for diﬀerent kinds of noise and u(Re = 6).
Note that by using our external noise, we are able to
produce noise intensities of the order of noise intensities
106 for the
measured in experiments (δ
von Karman ﬂow), and that are out of reach of DNS.
For low correlation time or injection scale, we are actu-
ally able to follow the deformation of the two windows of
dynamo action. One sees that a noise does not destroy
them, but rather distorts them. In the case where the
noise is at small scale (kI = 16), the two windows are

the curve diverges for δ2 of the order of 0.2, meaning
that time-ﬂuctuations of the kinetic energy superseding
20 percent of the total energy annihilate the dynamo.

We now turn to detailed comparison of dynamo thresh-
olds obtained in KS simulation with DNS-MHD case. In
Fig. 5, we show that the dynamo threshold obtained at
kI = 1, for τc & 1 as a function of the noise intensity cor-
responds to the DNS-MHD dynamo threshold. Note that
the noise intensity δ saturates past a Reynolds number of
about 100 (Fig. 2-a), thereby inducing the saturation of
the critical magnetic Reynolds number at large Reynolds
number. To check that our results are not aﬀected by the
choice of u, we ran additional KS simulations with u com-
puted at Re = 25, 46 and 100. Since the computational
cost in these cases is much larger than in the case Re = 6,
we focused on the case where the noise has a correlation
time τc = 1 or 8 sec. and injection scale kI = 1 and
only computed the critical magnetic Reynolds number for
the level of noise reached by the DNS at that Reynolds
number. Figure 5 shows that the dynamo threshold co-
incides with the dynamo thresholds both of KS simula-
tions at Re = 6 and of the DNS, indicating that a large
scale noise is probably responsible from the increase of
Rmturb
with Reynolds number. A physical identiﬁcation
c
of the dynamics of the velocity ﬂuctuations playing the
role of this noise can be performed by visual inspection of
the turbulent velocity ﬁeld. One observes that the large
scale vortices generated by the Taylor-Green forcing are
not exactly stationary, but wander slightly with time. A
similar large-scale non-stationarity has been observed in
the shear layer of Von Karman ﬂows[16, 17]. This pro-
cess is approximately reproduced by a large scale noise
with suﬃciently long correlation time, and may therefore
been held responsible for the signiﬁcant increase of the
dynamo threshold.

Our work suggests that it might not be so easy to
achieve turbulent dynamos in unconstrained geometries,
with large scale non-stationarity. In the experiments, a
necessary ingredient for dynamo action could therefore
be a monitoring of the large scale, so as to keep them as
stationary as possible. In geo- and astrophysical ﬂows,
this role could be played by the Coriolis force. Our work
also indicates that a well chosen noise can be used in place
of the actual turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations to compute
the dynamo threshold, at a much lower computational
cost.
In some sense, a kinematic-stochastic simulation
can therefore be seen as a turbulent model and might be
useful in the astro- or geophysical context.

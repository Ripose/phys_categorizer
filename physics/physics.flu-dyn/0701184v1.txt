SPLITTING OF RESONANT FREQUENCIES OF
ACOUSTIC WAVES IN ROTATING
COMPRESSIBLE FLUID

It is shown that in a rotating compressible ﬂuid the resonant frequencies
(measured in a system of reference rotating together with the medium)
for the azimuthally running acoustic waves are split into two compo-
nents. The received results can be of practical signiﬁcance as a basis of
a method of measurements of angular speed of medium and for acoustics
of rotating technical devices.

As is known [1], in a compressible ﬂuid, localized between two rigid coax-
ial cylindrical walls, free oscillations of the character of both standing and
running in an azimuthal direction waves are possible. With the help of the
equations

˙~V = −~∇˜p ,

ρ0

˙˜p = −ρ0c2

0 div ~V

(1)

in the absence of axial
it is easy to show that for the standing waves,
component of oscillation speed ~V (i.
e., for Vz = 0), the acoustic pres-
sure ˜p = p − p0 looks like ˜p(r, ϕ, t) = Pm(r) cos m ϕ cos ωmnt, and for
the azimuthally running waves ˜p(r, ϕ, t) = Pm(r) cos(m ϕ − ωmnt). Here,
Pm(r) = A Jm(ωmnr/c0) + B Ym(ωmnr/c0), A and B are the constants,
r, ϕ, z are the cylindrical coordinates, Jm and Ym are the Bessel functions
[2], m n are the integers, p0, ρ0 and c0 are the equilibrium pressure, density
and sound speed. The sets of resonant frequencies ωmn for both cases are
identical and can be found from the equation

J ′
m (ωR1/c0) Y ′

m (ωR2/c0) = J ′

Let us consider the behaviour of such waves on the background of the
equilibrium state of the medium rotating with a constant angular speed ~Ω.

(gas), considered from the point of view of the system of reference S rotating
together with the ﬂuid, are described by system of equations

˙~V + (~V · ~∇)~V = − ρ−1 ~∇p + Ω2 ~r + 2 [~V × ~Ω],
˙ρ + div(ρ~V ) = 0,

˙p + ~V · ~∇p = c2( ˙ρ + ~V · ~∇ρ),

where ~V is the velocity of a medium element relative to S. Within the limits
of linear acoustics and for relatively low speeds of rotation (i. e., for small
value of M = ΩR/c), system (3), in view of a condition of equilibrium
~∇p0 = ρ0Ω2 ~r, leads (instead of (1)) to the following equations:

˙~V = −ρ−1

0 ~∇˜p + 2[~V × ~Ω],

˙˜p = −ρ0c2

0 div ~V .

System (4), (5) describes adequately the corrections of the ﬁrst order in
M, caused by the inﬂuence of the medium rotation on oscillations, if the
conditions M ≪ 1 and VA/c ∼ M 2 are satisﬁed (VA is the amplitude of the
velocity of oscillations). Thus the ratio Ω/ω for the resonant values of ω will
be of the order M, and p0, ρ0, and c0 in equations (4), (5) can be considered
constant.

This allows to use system (4), (5), for example, for the frequencies of
rotation of the order 1 – 10 r.p.s. and the radial sizes 0.2 – 0.5 m for the
sound intensity corresponding to the values VA/c < 10−5 for both gases and
liquids.

It is easy to check that, in the approximation considered, elimination of ~V
from (4), (5) leads to the same diﬀerential equation for the acoustic pressure
˜p as in the case of non-rotating medium:

At the same time, the boundary condition for ˜p(r, ϕ, t) on a rigid cylin-
drical wall of the radius R (that follows from the requirement Vr(r = R) = 0)
gets, by virtue of (4), an additional term, which have the ﬁrst order in Ω/ω:

As for the azimuthally running wave (i. e., for the harmonic of number
m = ±1, ±2, ±3. . . ) the acoustic pressure ˜p(r, ϕ, t) looks like Pm(r) cos (m ϕ−

where R1 and R2 are the radiuses of rigid coaxial cylindrical walls between
which the wave is localized.

According to equation (6), when Ω 6= 0, Pm(r) holds the form A Jm(ωr/c0)+

B Ym(ωr/c0). Substituting Pm(r) in (8), we receive, instead of (2), the con-

For a cylinder of the radius R (i. e., for R1= 0, R2 = R) the function
Pm(r) is reduced to A Jm(ω r/c0), and we can receive the approximated

As the frequencies of the running waves following and opposing a direction
of rotation are not equal, it is impossible to construct a standing wave as
some their superposition. The absence of standing waves for m Ω 6= 0 follows
directly from impossibility to satisfy boundary conditions (7) by the pressure
˜p(r, ϕ, t) of the form Pm(r) cos m ϕ cos ωt. For m Ω 6= 0, a pulse of waves
moving in an azimuthal direction with the angular speed Ωpuls
mn , which is
mn − ω−
equal to (ω+
mn)/(2m) relative to rotating medium, will occur instead
of a standing wave.

The splitting of sound frequencies in a rotating medium can be, in some

sense, considered as an acoustic analog of the Sagnac eﬀect in optics [3].

For values of parameters M = ΩR/c and VA/c, which are rather greater
than considered above, taking into account of nonlinear members in equa-
tions and corresponding correction of the received results are necessary. We
expect, however, that, at least for weak nonlinearity, the eﬀect of splitting
of frequencies will be of similar character, and that the resonant response of
medium will begin to be also revealed on the frequencies of pulses.

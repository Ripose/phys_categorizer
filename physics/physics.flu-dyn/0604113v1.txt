Comment on ”Self-Running Droplet: Emergence
of Regular Motion from Nonequilibrium Noise”

In a recent Letter [1] a spontaneous motion of an oil
droplet in the surrounding aqueous media along a glass
surface was reported. The authors suggested that the
self-locomotion is driven by a diﬀerence in wettability
(∆γsl) between the front and the rear of a droplet sus-
tained by its translational motion. Whereas we do not
question the presented experimental results, our com-
ment concerns the underlying physical mechanism of the
motion.

We have analyzed movies 2 and 3 (Ref.22 in [1]) in
details using LabView software. For every frame of the
de-fragmented movies both advanced and receding con-
tact regions of the drop’s contour (∼ 50 points) were
subtracted and approximated by polynomial functions.
The drop contour was then extrapolated to the substrate
and the contact angles and instantaneous velocities were
determined.

For repetitive motion of a droplet on a narrow horizon-
tal strip (movie 2, Fig.1a), the mean values of the advanc-
ing and receding contact angles are θa = (115.7 ± 5.4)◦,
θr = (113.5 ± 3.5)◦, respectively, and ∆θ = (2.2 ± 6.4)◦ ∼
0. The instantaneous velocity U (t), exhibits sinusoidal
behavior without any appreciable variation in ∆θ in time,
that is inconsistent with [1].

The analysis of a droplet motion inside the vertical
circle (movie 3, Fig.1b) shows a variation of ∆θ vs. the
angular position φ similar to that caused by a static in-
terplay between gravity and capillarity in presence of the

by ∆γsl between the front and the rear of the drop, one
would expect cos θa − cos θr to deviate noticeably from
the prediction of [2] (the solid line in Fig.1b).

We have successfully reproduced most of the exper-
iments of [1] with a similar system: Wt/CTAB(0.45–
1.0 mM) and benzonitrile/NaI(8.0–80 mM). We also per-
formed a similar experiment with oil lenses deposited at
the air-water interface [7]. The observed motion and
the speed (up to ∼1 cm/s) of the self-running lenses
were similar to those measured for immersed drops in
[1]. Thus, interaction with solid surface is not central for
self-locomotion.

We argue that the mechanism of propulsion is that
due to chemo-capillary eﬀect.
It has been predicted
in [3] that Marangoni convection may result in a

spontaneous motion of a reactive droplet suspended in
a viscous ﬂuid. Although the experimentally observed
velocities of chemo-capillary drift [4] are ∼ 100 times
smaller than those in [1], we anticipate that fast speeds
are attainable in certain systems [5]. We found that
transport across the w/o interface is accompanied by
the formation of microemulsion phase inside the drop.
It is well known that the surface tension, γ, between
the microemulsion phase and the co-existing water-rich
phase is ultralow, i.e., 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller
than the bare oil-water value [6]. Thus, the gradients of
γ in the vicinity of phase transition threshold could be
enormously large [5], yielding ∼cm/s speeds, while in [4]
the motion is driven by weak near-equilibrium variation
of γ with surface concentration of surfactant. We also
found that the use of non-cationic surfactant results in
a slow drift as in [4].

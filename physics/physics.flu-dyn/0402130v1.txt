When a viscous ﬂuid, like oil or syrup, streams from a small oriﬁce and falls freely under gravity,
it forms a long slender thread, which can be maintained in a stable, stationary state with lengths up
to several meters. We shall discuss the shape of such liquid threads and their surprising stability.
It turns out that the strong advection of the falling ﬂuid can almost outrun the Rayleigh-Plateau

INTRODUCTION

II. DERIVATION OF THE MODEL.

When honey or sirup is poured from an outlet, one
easily generates very long threads of ﬂowing ﬂuid of sur-
prising beauty and stability. A uniform column of ﬂuid
is unstable due to surface tension eﬀects - the famous
Rayleigh-Plateau instability [1]. Viscosity diminishes the
strength, but does not remove the instability, and thus
the observation of stable falling viscous threads of, say,
two meters is surprising. In the present paper we shall
discuss the shape and stability of such falling viscous jets
or threads. We should note from the outset that we are
conﬁning our attention to Newtonian ﬂuids (e.g. sirup or
Silicone oil).

Our starting point is the lubrication approximation
(see. e.g. [2]), which only takes into account the leading
order dependence of the velocity ﬁeld on the radial vari-
able and of which we give a short derivation in section
II. In section III we study the stationary solutions, and
in particular their asymptotic forms. The ﬁnal asymp-
totics (for large downstream distance z) is always gov-
erned solely by gravity, as in a free fall. Then we pro-
ceed with linear stability analysis (section IV-IV). After
a recapitulation of the classical Rayleigh-Plateau insta-
bility in the lubrication approximation in the absence of
gravity, we then study the full linear stability problem
of a falling thread using an Eulerian description in the
comoving frame. We consider ﬁrst the inviscid regime,
which determines the asymptotics for large times if it ex-
ist at all. We then asses the importance of viscosity and
ﬁnd that it determines the opposite asymptotics of spa-
tially growing modes at short times. Small viscosity thus
means that the ﬂow breaks up without ever reaching the
inviscid asymptotic state.

∗Electronic address: senchen@fysik.dtu.dk

To derive our model we use the lubrication approxi-
mation, and our derivation is thus very close to the one
given e.g by Eggers [2]. Since we wish to include gravity
our equations are scaled diﬀerently, however. The veloc-
ity ﬁeld is assumed to be axisymmetrical, and it is con-
venient to use cylindrical coordinates. We thus assume
that the velocity ﬁeld has the form: ~v = u~er +w~ez, where
r is the radial coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate,
measured positive downwards. We assume that the veloc-
ity ﬁeld has no azimuthal component. The Navier-Stokes

and we assume that the ﬂuid is conﬁned to a thin axi-
ally symmetric thread with a free surface at r = h(z, t).
We expand pressure and velocity ﬁelds in power series
in r, and assume that the expansion parameter r is
(asymptotically) small with respect to vertical coordi-
nate z at a given cross-section of the ﬂuid thread, i.e.

III. STATIONARY SOLUTIONS.

The shape of a stationary thread has been studied
by several authors (see [4]-[9]), but since the results are
somewhat scattered and incomplete, we have found it im-
portant describe the stationary states in some detail. For
stationary solutions the non-dimensional ﬂux: q = h2v is
constant and we end up with the following equation for
velocity ﬁeld only:

vvz = 1

(22)

It is possible to remove dependence on q by an appro-
priate rescaling, but we prefer to keep it since the total
ﬂux is the only parameter of the model that can easily
be changed in a typical experiment. The ﬂux q is by the
scaling (19) related to the physical ﬂux Q as

q = α−3βQ/π = σ−5/4g3/4Q/π.

When (22) is solved forward in z, i.e. as an ”initial

noting that the ﬁxed point (v, vz) = (0, 0) has a well-
deﬁned unstable manifold (separating solutions that di-
verge to plus or minus inﬁnity), which upon backward
integration becomes a stable manifold.
In Fig. 1 we
show typical phase space trajectories found by solving
(22) numerically by means of a fourth-order Runge-Kutta
method, starting from ”initial conditions” (v0, vz0) at
large z and integrating backwards.
It is seen that the
dependence on the particular choice of downﬂow condi-
tions is very week since any phase trajectory quickly con-
verges to the well deﬁned stable manifold. Thus, even for
a thread of moderate length the shape is uniquely deter-
mined irrespective of the precise downstream conditions,
just as we would expect.

The asymptotic behaviour of the solution as z

easily seen to be controlled by only the two ﬁrst terms in
(22), i.e.

This asymptotic solution is shown by the dot-dashed
curve in Fig. 1 (marked ”inertial”).

The behaviour of the unstable manifold near the ﬁxed
point (v, vz) = (0, 0) can be found by expanding in z.
Clearly v = Cz2 + O(z3) for the RHS of (22) to remain
ﬁnite as z
0. Inserting this expression into (22), we
see that the inertial term vvz can be neglected, since it
contributes only as z3, whereas all other terms contribute
with z0-terms, and we ﬁnd

if we instead assume that x

to assume the following behaviour of the amplitudes of

V. DISCUSSION.

∼

The stationary ﬂow of a long falling viscous thread,
z−1/4 is unstable as ex-
with the asymptotic shape h(z)
pected from the classical results for the stability of a ﬂuid
cylinder. The perturbations grow, however, very slowly,
increasing asymptotically only as exp(const t1/4), where
the constant is independant of viscosity. What is the
role of viscosity then? First, with respect to stationary
solution, viscosity deﬁnes the structure of the ﬂow near
the outlet. The crossover between viscous and inertial
ν2/3. The less viscous
solutions is found to scale like
threads are vulnerable due to spatial instability, since the
perturbations grow like exp(ν−1/2x2) along the thread.
For large viscosities, the eﬀects of spatial instability are
weak, and the inviscid asymptotics will dominate the de-
velopment of the break-up. It is interesting to note, that
the ﬁnal instability is so weak, that if the gravitational
za, with 1/7 < a < 1,
ﬁeld was growing slowly i.e. g(z)
the thread would become asymptotically stable.

Thus the highest power of t under the inner summa-

t−(3n+7)/4t−1 exp(εkt1/4). This should be com-

As for the last term in the RHS of (74), it only produces
minor corrections to the main solution even in the leading
order of magnitude. Thus we see that for

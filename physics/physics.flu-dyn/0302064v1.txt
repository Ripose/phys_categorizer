The hodograph method applicability in the problem of long-scale nonlinear dynamics
of a thin vortex ﬁlament near a ﬂat boundary

(Dated: July 24, 2013)

Hamiltonian dynamics of a thin vortex ﬁlament in ideal incompressible ﬂuid near a ﬂat ﬁxed
boundary is considered at the conditions that at any point of the curve determining shape of the
ﬁlament the angle between tangent vector and the boundary plane is small, also the distance from
a point on the curve to the plane is small in comparison with the curvature radius. The dynamics is
shown to be eﬀectively described by a nonlinear system of two (1+1)-dimensional partial diﬀerential
equations. The hodograph transformation reduces that system to a single linear diﬀerential equation
of the second order with separable variables. Simple solutions of the linear equation are investigated
at real values of spectral parameter λ when the ﬁlament projection on the boundary plane has shape
of a two-branch spiral or a smoothed angle, depending on the sign of λ.

INTRODUCTION

It is a well known fact that solutions of equations deter-
mining the motion of a homogeneous inviscid ﬂuid pos-
sess a remarkable property — the lines of the vorticity
ﬁeld are frozen-in [1, 2, 3, 4]. Mathematical reason for
this is the so called relabeling symmetry of ﬂuids that
provides necessary conditions for the Noether theorem
applicability and results in inﬁnite number of the conser-
vation laws [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . Due to this basic prop-
erty, in the framework of ideal hydrodynamics such ﬂows
are possible where during suﬃciently long time inter-
val the vorticity is concentrated in quasi-one-dimensional
structures, vortex ﬁlaments, that ﬁll a small part of entire
bulk of the ﬂuid. The motion of vortex ﬁlaments is very
interesting problem both from theoretical and practical
viewpoints and is a classical subject of hydrodynamics
(see, for instance, [3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and
references therein for various analytical and numerical
approaches to this problem). In general case analytical
study in this ﬁeld is highly complicated because of several
reasons, the main of them being non-locality and nonlin-
earity of governing equations of motion. A less signiﬁcant
trouble seems to be the necessity of some regularization
procedure for the Hamiltonian functional (the total en-
ergy) of the system in the limit of “inﬁnitely thin” vor-
tex ﬁlaments, since a logarithmic divergency takes place
in some observable physical quantities (for instance, in
the velocity of displacement of curved pieces of the ﬁla-
ment) as the thickness decreases. However, in few limit
cases the dynamics of a single vortex ﬁlament can turn
out to be eﬀectively integrable. A known and very in-
teresting example of such integrable system is a slender
non-stretched vortex ﬁlament (in the boundless three-
dimensional (3D) space ﬁlled by an ideal ﬂuid) in the so
called localized induction approximation (LIA), when in

∗Electronic address: ruban@itp.ac.ru

the energy of the ﬁlament only logarithmically large con-
tributions from interaction of adjacent pieces are taken
into account. In this approximation the Hamiltonian is
simply proportional to the length of the ﬁlament, result-
ing in conservation this quantity, thus application of the
so called Hasimoto transformation [18, 19] is appropriate
and reduces the problem to (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear
Schroedinger equation that is known to be integrable by
the inverse scattering method [20].

In present work another integrable case in vortex dy-
namics is recognized, the long-scale motion of a thin vor-
tex ﬁlament near a ﬂat ﬁxed boundary. Mathematically
the problem of a single ﬁlament in a half-space is equiv-
alent to the problem of two symmetric ﬁlaments in the
boundless space, that allows us simplify some further cal-
culations. Our immediate purpose will be to consider the
conﬁgurations of the vortex ﬁlament that satisfy the fol-
lowing conditions:

a) the angle is everywhere small between the tangent
vector on the curve determining the shape of the ﬁlament
and the boundary plane;

b) the distance from an arbitrary point of the curve
to the plane is small comparatively to the curvature ra-
dius at the given point but large in comparison with the
thickness of the ﬁlament;

c) the ﬁlament projection on the boundary plane does
not have self-intersections or closely approaching one-to-
another diﬀerent pieces.

In these conditions the system dynamics is known to
be unstable (the so called Crow instability [21]), with the
instability increment directly proportional to the wave
number of (some small) long-scale perturbation of the
ﬁlament shape. It is a well known fact that such depen-
dence of the increment is usual for a class of local (2
2)
partial diﬀerential systems that can be exactly linearized
by so called hodograph transformation [1] exchanging de-
pendent and independent variables. This observation has
served as a weighty reason to look for a natural local non-
linear approximation in description of the long-scale dy-
namics of a vortex ﬁlament near a ﬂat boundary and to

×

examine that approximation for the hodograph method
applicability. As the result, a consistent derivation of the
corresponding local approximate equations of motion has
been performed, and also the fact has been demonstrated
that the nonlinear partial diﬀerential system for two func-
tions ρ and ϑ determining the shape of the ﬁlament and
depending on the time moment t and on the Cartesian
coordinate x is reduced by hodograph transformation to
a linear equation. Moreover, it is possible to choose the
pair of new independent variables in such a manner that
in the linear partial diﬀerential equation for the func-
tion t(ρ, ϑ) the coeﬃcients will not depend on ϑ-variable.
For this purpose it is convenient to deﬁne ρ-variable as
double distance from a ﬁlament point to the boundary
plane y = 0, while ϑ-variable will be the angle between
x-direction and the tangent to the ﬁlament projection on
(x, z)-plane. Obviously, an explicit dependence of the co-
eﬃcients on ϑ will be absent due to the symmetry of the
system with respect to rotations in (x, z)-plane. There-
fore separation of the variables will be possible and most
simple solutions will have the form

tλ(ρ, ϑ) = Re

where λ is an arbitrary complex parameter, and the com-

To ﬁnd the complex function Tλ(ρ), it will be necessary
to solve some ordinary linear diﬀerential equation of the
second order with variable coeﬃcients that will be con-
sidered in appropriate section of this paper. The cor-

the projection has the shape of a two-branch spiral (see

This article is organized as follows. In section II a nec-
essary brief review is given concerning the Hamiltonian
formalism adopted to the problem of frozen-in vorticity,
since this approach is the most clear and compact way
to treat ideal ﬂows. Then approximate local equations
of motion for a vortex ﬁlament near a ﬂat boundary are
derived.
In section III we demonstrate applicability of
the hodograph method and introduce variables that are
most convenient for the particular problem. Section IV is
devoted to investigation of simple solutions obtained by
the variables separation in the governing linear equation.

bulk is closely connected with the freezing-in property of
the vortex lines [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
Mathematically this property is expressed by the special
form of the equation of motion for the divergence-free
vorticity ﬁeld Ω(r, t) = curl v(r, t),

Ωt = curl [v

Ω],

where v(r, t) is the velocity ﬁeld. Since in this article we
consider incompressible ﬂows, we may write

v = curl −1Ω = curl (

where ∆ is the 3D Laplace operator. As it is known,
the action of the inverse nonlocal operator ∆−1 on an

Our approach to investigation of the vortex ﬁlament
motion is based on representation of the ideal homoge-
neous ﬂuid ﬂows in terms of the frozen-in vortex lines, as
described, for instance, in [10, 11, 12, 13]. The special
form (3) of the equation of motion allows us express the
vorticity ﬁeld Ω(r, t) in a self-consistent manner through
the shape of the vortex lines (the so called formalism of
vortex lines),

Below we choose D(R) = (0, Y, 0).

Since we are going to deal with a very thin vortex ﬁl-
ament, we will neglect the ν-dependence of the shapes
of individual vortex lines constituting the ﬁlament. By
doing this step we exclude from further consideration all
eﬀects related to ﬁnite variable cross-section and longi-
tudinal ﬂows inside the ﬁlament. Thus, we consider an
“inﬁnitely narrow” vortex string with a shape R(ξ, t) and

system, but in the case of a ﬁnite a it is not valid on dis-
tances of order a from the singular vortex string. Thus,
the meaning of vorticity in regularized models is not so
simple, but nevertheless, relation (6) remains valid in any
case. Relatively small parameter a in regularized models
serves to imitate a ﬁnite width of vortex ﬁlament in the
usual (non-regularized) hydrodynamics. The energy of
the string turns out to be logarithmically large,

our case we consider two symmetric vortex ﬁlaments in

varies weakly on a length of order Y . For such conﬁgu-

This local Hamiltonian is able to provide qualitatively
correct dynamics of the ﬁlament down to longitudinal
scales of order Y where perturbations become stable and
where non-locality comes to play. Unfortunately, we do
not have a simple method to treat the Hamiltonian (13)
analytically, that is why we will consider only very large

square root, we sacriﬁce correct behaviour of perturba-
tions with wave-lengths of order Y , but instead we obtain
exactly solvable system, as it will be shown below.

≡

Let us say a few words about geometrical meaning of
the second term in r.h.s. of the expression (14). Since
we study the very long-scale limit, locally the ﬂow under
consideration looks almost like a two-dimensional ﬂow
with a small vortex at the distance Y from the straight
boundary, and the expression (Γ/4π) log(2Y /a) is just
the energy of such 2D ﬂow per unit length in the third
(longitudinal) direction, while the multiplier √1 + Z ′2 dx
gives the arc-length element in the longitudinal direction.
Now for simplicity we take new time and length scales
to satisfy a = 1 and Γ/2π = 1. After that we introduce
new quantities ρ(x, t) = 2Y (x, t) and µ(x, t) = ∂xZ(x, t),
and also the function H(ρ, µ),

H(ρ, µ) = F (ρ)

1 + µ2,

(15)

where

p

F (ρ) = log ρ.

(16)

The corresponding equations of motion then can be writ-
ten in the following remarkable general form:

More explicitly, the last two equations are

µ = ∂xZ,
∂tρ + ∂xHµ(ρ, µ) = 0,
∂tZ + Hρ(ρ, µ) = 0.

These equations have a simple geometrical treatment.
Indeed, Eq.(21) means if we consider the dynamics of
the ﬁlament projection on (x, z)-plane, then we see an
element of the projection moving in the normal to the
projection tangent direction with the velocity depend-
ing only on ρ and equal to F ′(ρ). Simultaneously, in
y-direction the element of the ﬁlament moves with the
velocity proportional to the (x, z)-projection curvature
multiplied by the function F (ρ), as Eq.(20) shows.

It is interesting to note that an analogous considera-
tion can give us also long-scale Hamiltonian equations of

4

(28)

motion for a thin vortex ﬁlament in a slab of an ideal
ﬂuid between two parallel ﬁxed boundaries at y =
d/2
and y = +d/2. One has just to deﬁne the ρ-variable by
the formula ρ = (π/d)y and make in Eq.(15) substitution

χ(ρ, ϑ) =

(27)

where ϑ is the angle in (x, z)-plane between x-direction
and the tangent to the corresponding projection of the
vortex ﬁlament. As the result, the relations (23) and (24)
will be rewritten in the form

III. HODOGRAPH METHOD

It is known that any nonlinear system of the form (17)-
(19) can be locally reduced to a linear equation if we
take ρ and µ as new independent variables (this is the so
called hodograph method; see, for instance, [1] where a
particular case is discussed, the 1D gas dynamics, with
H(ρ, µ) = ρµ2/2 + ε(ρ), where ρ, µ, ε(ρ) are the gas
density, gas velocity, and the internal energy density re-
spectively). Indeed, as from equations (17) and (19) we
see the relation

dZ = µ dx

Hρ dt,

−

it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary function
χ(ρ, µ),

χ = Z

xµ + tHρ

(23)

in order to obtain

dχ =

−

From the above expression we easily derive

t =

χρ
Hρρ

,

x = Hρµ

χρ
Hρρ −

χµ.

(24)

After that we rewrite Eq.(18) in the form

∂(ρ, x)
∂(t, x) −

Hµρ

∂(ρ, t)
∂(t, x) −

Hµµ

∂(µ, t)
∂(t, x)

= 0

and multiply it by the Jacobian ∂(t, x)/∂(ρ, µ),

∂(ρ, µ) −

Hµρ

∂(ρ, t)
∂(ρ, µ) −

Hµµ

∂(µ, t)
∂(ρ, µ)

= 0.

Thus, now we have

xµ = Hµρtµ −

Hµµtρ.

(25)

Substitution of the relations (24) into this equation and
subsequent simpliﬁcation give us the linear partial dif-
ferential equation of the second order for the function
χ(ρ, µ),

uρ(ρ, ϑ)/F ′′(ρ),

−

F (ρ)tρρ + 2F ′(ρ)tρ −

F ′′(ρ)tϑϑ = 0.

(32)

Once some particular solution of Eq.(31) is known,
then further procedure consists in the following two steps:
i) ﬁnd in terms of some parameter ξ the curves of con-
uρ(ρ, ϑ)/F ′′(ρ). It is
stant values of the function t =
this point where nonlinearity comes to play, since we need
to solve nonlinear equation;

−

ii) substitute the obtained expressions ρ = ρ(ξ, t) and
ϑ = ϑ(ξ, t) into Eqs.(29-30) and get complete description
of the ﬁlament motion, X = X(ξ, t), Z = Z(ξ, t), Y =
(1/2)ρ(ξ, t).

Thus, the long-scale local approximation (14) turns out
to be integrable in the sense it is reduced to the linear
equation (31). However, the function u(ρ, ϑ) is multi-
valued in the general case. Therefore statement of the
Cauchy problem becomes much more complicated. Be-
sides, the functions F (ρ) and F (ǫ)(ρ) determined by ex-
pressions (16) and (22) result in elliptic linear equations
as against the usual 1D gas dynamics where the corre-
sponding equations were hyperbolic. Generally speaking,
the ellipticity makes the Cauchy problem ill-posed in the
mathematical sense if initial data are not very smooth.
However, in this article we will not discuss these ques-
tions, instead in the following section we will present
simple particular solutions that during some time inter-
val satisfy the applicability conditions for the long-scale
approximation.

Let us ﬁrst consider real values of the spectral param-

In Ref.[13] we investigated another regularization of
the Hamiltonian functional that corresponds to F (ρ) =
ρα/α, with some small positive parameter α. That time
we did not see applicability of the hodograph method and
therefore we were able to ﬁnd only few particular solu-
tions. Now it has been clear that in this case a simple
substitution exists that reduces the problem to 2D equa-
tion ∆2f + f = 0. Thus, it becomes possible to present
a very wide class of solutions of the equation

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article an approximate exactly solvable nonlin-
ear model has been derived to describe unstable locally-
quasi-2D ideal ﬂows with a thin vortex ﬁlament near
a ﬂat boundary. The hodograph method has been ap-
plied and some particular solutions have been analyti-
cally found by variables separation in the governing lin-
ear partial diﬀerential equation for auxiliary function u.
More general solutions u(ρ, ϑ) can be obtained as linear
combinations of the terms (33) with diﬀerent λ, but only
in few cases it will be possible to resolve analytically the
uρ(ρ, ϑ)/F ′′(ρ). However, this proce-
dependence t =
−
dure can be performed numerically.

Though we derived the exactly solvable model under
several restrictive simpliﬁcations, the solutions obtained
in this work promise beneﬁt in many aspects. For in-
stance, they may serve as basic approximations in future
more advanced analytical studies that will take into ac-
count eﬀects of non-locality and/or ﬁnite variable cross-
section of the ﬁlament, as well as surface waves in the
case of free boundary.

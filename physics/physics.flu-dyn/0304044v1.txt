A phenomenological turbulence model in which the energy spectrum obeys a nonlinear diﬀusion
equation is presented. This equation respects the scaling properties of the original Navier-Stokes
equations and it has the Kolmogorov −5/3 cascade and the thermodynamic equilibrium spectra as
exact steady state solutions. The general steady state in this model contains a nonlinear mixture
of the constant-ﬂux and thermodynamic components. Such “warm cascade” solutions describe the
bottleneck phenomenon of spectrum stagnation near the dissipative scale. Self-similar solutions
describing a ﬁnite-time formation of steady cascades are analysed and found to exhibit nontrivial
scaling behaviour.

In this letter, we present a model equation for the energy spectrum of isotropic homogeneous turbulence,

where t is time, k is the absolute value of the wavenumber, ν is the kinematic viscosity coeﬃcient, f is an external
E dk. The third term on
forcing and the energy spectrum E(k, t) is normalised so that the kinetic energy density is
the RHS of this equation is obvious and describes the linear process of viscous dissipation. The ﬁrst term contains a
nontrivial model of the nonlinear processes in turbulence which rests on three basic properties[9]:

1. The total energy density

E dk is conserved by the inviscid dynamics. The characteristic time of the spectral

energy redistribution for local interaction of turbulent scales is of order of the vortex turnover time, 1/√k3E.

an interesting nonlinear combination and not just as a linear superposition because equation (1) is nonlinear. Thus,
one can refer to solution (3) with ﬁnite P and Q as a warm cascade to distinguish it from the pure Kolmogorov
solution which could be viewed as a cold cascade.

∼

Let us suppose that turbulence is produced near some scale k = k0 so that f (k) > 0 only in a ﬁnite range in the
vicinity of k0. Suppose that f (k) = 0 to the left of this range (at large scales) and in a large inertial range to the

important. Then, up-scale of the forcing there will be a pure thermodynamic solution with P = 0 and Q
there is no dissipation or forcing assumed to be present near k = 0 to absorb or generate a ﬁnite energy ﬂux. In
the inertial range down-scale of the forcing there will be a constant ﬂux cascade solution. This solution typically
takes the form of a pure Kolmogorov (cold) cascade and extends down to the dissipation range where the energy
ﬂux is absorbed. Typically, the solution only penetrates a ﬁnite distance into the dissipation range and adapts itself
until it provides suﬃcient dissipation to absorb the supplied ﬂux. In the presence of dissipation, the model does not
develop structure at arbitrarily high k as it would in the inviscid case. The qualitative features of the steady state
are independent of the detailed form chosen for the dissipation. Figure 1 shows the steady state solutions obtained
numerically for several diﬀerent choices of the dissipation.

However, if the dissipation is not suﬃciently strong, the solution can penetrate far enough into the dissipation
range to reach the maximal wave-number which necessarily exists in any numerical solution. If one imposes a zero
ﬂux condition at the right end of the computational interval, the energy ﬂux is reﬂected from the maximal wave-number
leading to greater values of E in the dissipative range. Such a cascade stagnation acts to enhance the dissipation rate
and thereby to adjust it to the energy ﬂux to be absorbed. This phenomenon is common in numerical simulations of
turbulence and is usually called the bottleneck phenomenon [3]. Figure 2 shows a numerically obtained steady state
for the dissipation function,

cold cascade solution near the dissipative scale. In our model, the bottleneck phenomenon is described by the warm
10−9 in
cascade solutions; in particular the theoretical curve in ﬁgure 2 is computed by taking P
equation (3). The relative importance of the “thermal” eﬀects with respect to the cascade grows as one moves from
larger to smaller scales; in extreme cases the spectrum can be nearly pure Kolmogorov near the forcing range and
almost purely thermodynamic near the dissipative scale.

Because of the nonlinearity, solutions for given forms of forcing and dissipation are usually hard to ﬁnd analytically
and one has to use numerics. However, a lot of insight about the qualitative behavior of the system can be gained
from considering stationary solutions (3) in an inertial range k1 < k < k2 and ﬁxing the spectrum at its boundaries,
E(k1) = E1, E(k2) = E2. This kind of the boundary conditions roughly models the forcing and the dissipation eﬀects
outside of the inertial range. This gives

imposing a constant ﬂux boundary condition across the left end of the computational interval. Owing to the ﬁnite

solution has a nonlinear front at k = k∗(t) and this front accelerates explosively, reaching k =
time which we shall denote by t∗. We can equally consider the decaying case where an initial distribution of energy,
compactly supported at large scales, is allowed to spread under the action of the nonlinearity without any external
within a ﬁnite
forcing. Provided there is suﬃcient energy in the initial condition, the right front still reaches k =

does not exhibit singular behaviour in ﬁnite time. Hence the decaying case is broadly similar to the forced case as far
as large k behaviour is concerned since the initial concentration of energy at large scales acts as an eﬀective forcing
for the right front.

It is well known (see for example [4]) that the solutions of nonlinear diﬀusion equations with compactly supported
initial data often have the property of remaining compactly supported during the time evolution. This turns out
to be the case here. The left and right nonlinear fronts actually correspond to the left and right extrema of the
support of the solution. Since these points must be determined as part of the solution, we are, in principle, required
to solve a moving boundary problem with two free boundaries. In order that the problem be well-posed, we require
an additional moving boundary condition on each interface[5]. For the problem under consideration, the appropriate

We performed numerical simulations of the forced solutions of equation (1) with compact initial data and constant

and the singular time, t∗, are most conveniently extracted from the relation

veriﬁed that the same value of b is obtained for the decaying case. Such anomalous scaling behavior whereby the
exponent of the solution in the wake of the nonlinear front is larger than the Kolmogorov value has been observed
before. Examples include MHD wave turbulence [6] and optical turbulence[7]. We expect that this anomaly is a
general property of ﬁnite capacity systems rather than a property of our model and therefore may also be present in
the Navier-Stokes equations.

IV. ORIGIN OF THE TRANSIENT SPECTRUM

For the model (1) the origin of the anomaly can be traced to the question of existence of a solution of the similarity
equation (15) which has the correct behaviour both for the wake and the tip. Written in terms of x rather than b and

Noting the similarity relations (14), we see that this condition is satisﬁed identically at the point P2.

The critical value of x occurs when the unstable manifold of P1 intersects the stable manifold of P2 thus forming
a connection between the two singular points of the original equations. This is then the only trajectory which can
satisfy the required conditions to describe both the tip and the wake. A numerical approximation to the unstable
manifold of the origin as x is varied through the critical value is shown in ﬁgure 6. The corresponding front proﬁles,
converted back into the self-similar variables are shown in ﬁgure 7.

In practice, any model should include dissipation so that this self-similar solution above will be valid only until
the front tip meets the dissipation scale. After this, the transient slope gets replaced in the inertial range by the
stationary cascade solution, with or without bottleneck depending on the dissipation, as discussed above.

In summary, we presented a simple model in which basic properties of the Navier-Stokes turbulence are built-in:
dimensionality and scaling, Kolmogorov and thermodynamic spectra. This model allows to obtain new predictions
about the “warm” cascade states which are a nonlinear mixture of the cascade and thermodynamic solutions and
which describe the bottleneck phenomenon. The model also allowed us to study the self-similar dynamics of the
ﬁnite-time formation of the steady cascade states.

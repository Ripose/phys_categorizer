Contact line motion for partially wetting ﬂuids

We study the ﬂow close to an advancing contact line in the limit of small capillary

number. To take into account wetting eﬀects, both long and short-ranged contribu-

tions to the disjoining pressure are taken into account. In front of the contact line,

there is a microscopic ﬁlm corresponding to a minimum of the interaction potential.

We compute the parameters of the contact line solution relevant to the matching to a

macroscopic problem, for example a spreading droplet. The result closely resembles

previous results obtained with a slip model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Moving contact lines are encountered in a great number of ﬂow problems, such as spread-

ing of liquid drops [1], dewetting of liquid ﬁlms [2], coating [3], and sloshing [4].

It was

discovered by Huh and Scriven [5] that the viscous dissipation in the ﬂuid wedge bordered

by a solid and a ﬂuid-gas interface is logarithmically inﬁnite if the standard hydrodynamic

equations and boundary conditions are used [6]. Thus continuum hydrodynamics does not

describe the spreading of a drop on a table. Instead, some microscopic length scale must be

introduced into the problem.

As a model problem, let us consider the spreading of a viscous drop on a ﬂat substrate.

Typical spreading speeds are so small [1] that the bulk of the drop is almost unaﬀected by

viscous shear forces. Hence the drop has the shape of a spherical cap, except in a small

region around the contact line [7].

If one extrapolates this spherical cap solution to the

contact line, it meets the solid at a well-deﬁned angle, called the “apparent” contact angle

θap. If for simplicity one assumes that the drop is thin, its radius R is related to θap by

θap = 4V /(πR3),

(1)

where V is the volume of the drop.

2

(2)

However, near the contact line the shear rate is of order U/h, where U is the contact line

speed and h the local thickness of the ﬂuid ﬁlm. Near the contact line viscous forces become

very large, and strongly bend the interface. A dimensionless measure of this viscous bending

is the capillary number Ca = ηU/γ, representing a ratio of viscous to capillary forces, with

η the viscosity and γ surface tension. As we will show below, within the approximation we
adopt here, the slope h′ of the interface as function of the distance x from the contact line

has the form [8]

h′3(x) = θ3

e + 9Ca ln(x/L),

where θe is the equilibrium contact angle and L a microscopic length scale. As illustrated

in Fig. 1, we have adopted a coordinate system in which the contact line is at rest. The
local description (2) applies for x/L ≫ 1, i.e. at a distance from the contact line where

microscopic details no longer matter.

The distinguishing feature of (2) is that the curvature vanishes for x/L → ∞. This is

a necessary condition for the local proﬁle (2) to be matchable to the spherical cap solution

that makes up the bulk of the spreading drop [9]. The details of this matching procedure

have been given in [10], the result being

ap = θ3
θ3

e + 9 ˙Rη/γ ln[R/(2e2L)],

(3)

where e = 2.718281 . . .. Together with (1), (3) is evidently a diﬀerential equation for the
radius of the spreading drop. For θap ≫ θe equations (1), (3) reproduce Tanner’s spreading
law [1] R = At1/10, neglecting logarithmic corrections in time t. To ﬁnd an explicit expression

for A, it remains to know the length L. In this paper, we are going to compute L for a

model that includes both long and short-ranged interactions in the interface potential [2].

This model has recently become popular for the numerical treatment of moving contact line

problems [11, 12].

To ﬁnd L, (2) has to be continued to the contact line, where microscopic eﬀects come

into play. Previous calculations [10] have done that for the case of ﬂuid slip over the solid

surface [13, 14], which relieves the contact line singularity. In the simplest case of a Navier

slip condition [5, 10], described by a slip length λ, the result is L = 3λ/(eθe). In [15] we have

extended this calculation to higher orders in the capillary number. However, corrections are

found to be small in a regime where the underlying lubrication description is still expected

to be valid [16]. Apart from the slip length, an angle has to be speciﬁed at the contact line,

which is often taken to be the equilibrium contact angle. This assumption implies that the

total dissipation near the contact line is dominated by viscous eﬀects, rather than dissipation

localized at the contact line [17].

Here we adopt a model that builds in the equilibrium properties in a more rational way,

by including the interface potential into the description. Both the equilibrium contact angle

[18] and the equilibrium ﬁlm thickness heq are determined by the interface potential. Within

the model, even the “dry” substrate is covered by a thin ﬁlm, corresponding to the minimum

of the interface potential. The presence of this ﬁlm thus formally eliminates the contact line

singularity, heq replacing the slip length λ as the cut-oﬀ length. Of course, we do not claim

that this is a true resolution of the contact line problem. The thickness heq is often below

the thickness of a single molecule, and even a monomolecular layer is not strictly describable

by a continuum theory.

Nevertheless, we believe that it is interesting to investigate the interplay between the

interface potential and viscous forces. This has ﬁrst been done by de Gennes, Hua, and

Levinson [19], but only taking into account the long-ranged part of the potential. As a

result, the equilibrium contact angle could only be worked in in an ad-hoc fashion, as one

needs the full potential to deﬁne it. We will see below that our results are in line with the

results obtained before [19]. The calculation in [20] is based on a simple energy balance,

rather than the systematic expansion performed here. The very recent work [21] treats both

the advancing and the receding contact line in a manner very close to ours.

Our paper is organized as follows. After introducing the model description, we recall the

case of a static contact line, relating the equilibrium contact angle to the interface potential.

We then outline how the parameter L of (2) may be found in an expansion in the capillary

number [15]. Assuming a particular form of the interface potential, we then solve the ﬁrst

order problem explicitly. Finally, we compare to other forms of the interface potential as

well as to previous work.

II. LUBRICATION DESCRIPTION

For simplicity, we perform our calculations within the framework of lubrication theory,

thus limiting ourselves to the case of small contact angles, as well as small capillary number

[22]. Experiment shows that this approximation performs reasonably well up to a capillary

number of 0.1 [16]. The lubrication equation reads [11]

3η¯ht = −

h3(γ¯hxx + Π(¯h))x
h

x
i

,

where ¯h(x, t) is the thickness of the ﬂuid ﬁlm and Π(¯h) is the disjoining pressure [18]. The
origin of (4) is a viscous shear ﬂow, driven by the gradient of the pressure p = −γ¯hxx −Π(¯h).

The ﬁrst term is the usual Laplace pressure, proportional to the curvature of the interface,
while the disjoining pressure Π(¯h) is given by Π(¯h) = ∂V /∂¯h, where V (¯h) is the eﬀective
interface potential of a ﬂat ﬁlm of thickness ¯h [2]. Thus as soon as ¯h is larger than the range
of all the interactions between particles, Π(¯h) can safely be neglected. However, when ¯h is

of the order of a few nanometers, the disjoining pressure becomes relevant.

To describe an advancing contact line (cf. Fig. 1), it is convenient to pass into a frame

of reference that moves with the contact line speed U:

giving

III. STATICS

It is instructive to look ﬁrst at the well-known static case Ca = 0. Integrating (7) once

more one obtains

P0 = −hxx − Π(h)/γ,

where P0 is the (constant) pressure in the ﬁlm (neglecting gravity). We are considering

a situation where the ﬁlm is in contact with a large reservoir (for example a drop) with

negligible pressure, hence P0 = 0. Thus in the ﬁlm we must have Π(heq) = 0 (corresponding

to a minimum of the interface potential), which deﬁnes the equilibrium ﬁlm thickness heq.

Now (8) can easily be solved by putting g(h) = hx(x), giving

Integrating (9), we obtain the standard expression [18]

for the equilibrium contact angle, which in the lubrication approximation is to be identiﬁed
with the slope of the interface: θe = tan(hx(∞)) ≈ hx(∞). By integrating to inﬁnity, we

imply that the macroscopic scale on which θe is deﬁned is much larger than heq.

To be more speciﬁc, the disjoining pressure has a long-ranged attractive and a short-

ranged repulsive part:

Π(h) =

A
6πh3

− B
hα .

The repulsive interaction keeps the ﬁlm thickness from collapsing to zero. The form of the

attractive part is rather universal [7], A being known as the Hamaker constant. The most

popular choice for the repulsive part is a power law with α = 9, which is motivated by

the form of the Lennard-Jones interaction. Recently, enormous progress has been made in

determining the constants in (11) for some systems [2]. However, the experiments are not

suﬃciently accurate to determine the value of the exponent α [23]. For some of the explicit

results to be reported below we are going to choose another value, α = 5, to be able to

perform our calculations analytically. Using the speciﬁc form of (11), one easily ﬁnds that

heq = (B/A)1/(α−3),

a logarithmic scale has been chosen, with ξ = 0 shifted somewhat to the left of the contact line

position.

To compute the proﬁle, it is useful to introduce new variables, which are scaled to the

equilibrium thickness heq of the ﬁlm:

static interface is shown in Fig.2. To the right of the contact line the slope asymptotes to

e is the rescaled capillary number. In the limit of small heq the boundaries

H(−∞) = Hf , H ′(−∞) = 0, H ′′(∞) = 0.

The ﬁrst two conditions correspond to the assumption that the liquid forms a ﬁlm of constant

thickness ahead of the contact line. We will see below that it deviates slightly from the

equilibrium thickness if the contact line is moving. The third boundary condition says that

the curvature far away form the contact line is vanishingly small compared to the typical

curvature near the contact line, which is 1/heq [15].

We are going to solve (17) in a perturbation expansion in δ, following a procedure adopted

before [15]. Of particular interest is the behavior of the solution for large ξ, which corre-
sponds to (2). Namely, for H ≫ 1 (17) assumes the universal form δ/H 2 = H ′′′, which has

the asymptotic solution [24]

H ′(ξ) = [3δ ln(ξ/ξ0)]1/3 ,

ξ ≫ 1.

This solution has vanishing curvature at inﬁnity (as required by (18)), and only contains a

single free parameter ξ0, to be determined by matching to the contact line. By comparing

(19) and (2), one ﬁnds

Lθe
heq

= ξ0e1/(3δ).

On the other hand, the full solution H(ξ) possesses a perturbation expansion in δ around

the static proﬁle H0(ξ) :

H(ξ) = H0(ξ) + δH1(ξ) + O(δ2).

For large ξ, we have H ′

0(ξ) ≈ 1, corresponding to the equilibrium contact angle. By com-

paring this to (19), we ﬁnd that ln(ξ0) has the following expansion:

− 3 ln(ξ0) =

+ c1 + O(δ).

Substituting into (19), we ﬁnd that for large ξ

To compute L, we thus take the following steps: First, we solve the full problem (17)

perturbatively to obtain H1(ξ). Then, analyzing H1 for large ξ, we obtain c1, which gives

ξ0 by virtue of (22). Combining this with (20), we ﬁnally have

where we have integrated once, resulting in a constant of integration C. From now on we

consider the special case α = 5, for which we can make use of the static solution H0(ξ) given

by (16).

The integral on the left-hand-side of (25) can be performed by exchanging the role of

dependent and independent variables using (15):

The limit of (26) for large ξ is ln(2), hence taking the same limit in (25) yields C = ln(2)
for the constant of integration. Now considering the opposite limit of ξ → −∞, and using
H0(−∞) = 1, one ﬁnds H1(−∞) = − ln(2)/4.

To solve (25), it is useful to rewrite the entire equation using H0 as the independent

variable. To avoid cumbersome expressions, we denote H0 by the symbol ζ. Thus (25) turns

b2 is determined by the terms of order ζ 0 as ζ → 1. In the limit of ζ → ∞, on the other
hand, one is approaching the bulk ﬂuid, for which we ﬁnd H (1)
1 ≈ 1, so a

1 ≈ 16ζ and H (2)

straightforward analysis of (29) yields

H1(ζ) = ζ(ln(ζ) − 2 ln(2)) + O(ln(ζ)).

(31)

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Now we are in a position to calculate the constant c1 appearing in (23). From (16) we

have ζ ≡ H0 ≈ ξ for large ξ, and thus

H ′

1(ζ) = (ln(ξ) − 2 ln(2) + 1)

(32)

10

(33)

(34)

in this limit. We conclude that H1 indeed has the asymptotic form (23) we anticipated, and

we can identify

Using (24), we now have

c1 = 3 − 6 ln(2).

L =

4heq
eθe

,

which is the central result of this paper.

The result (34) can of course be tested by comparing with a numerical solution of the full

equation (17). A linear analysis around the ﬁlm thickness H = Hf reveals an exponentially

growing solution

H(ξ) = Hf + ǫ exp(γξ),

(35)

where γ = 2 + O(δ). Any small perturbation of the constant solution H = Hf , H ′ = 0, H ′′ =
0 will thus lead to an initial growth of the form (35). As ξ → ∞, the solution generically

tends to a ﬁnite curvature [24]. Thus Hf has to be adjusted to ﬁnd the unique solution

which obeys the boundary condition (18) at inﬁnity. The asymptotics of this solution of

course has to conform with (19).

However, the approach to this solution is very slow, as revealed by the full asymptotic

expansion [25]

H ′(ξ) = [3δ ln(ξ/ξ0)]1/3

(ln(ξ/ξ0))i )

.

(36)

To be consistent with (19), the coeﬃcient b1 was chosen to vanish, since it would lead to

a redeﬁnition of ξ0. To obtain ξ0 numerically, we ﬁtted the numerical solution of (17) to

(36), using the ﬁrst ﬁve terms of the expansion. In Fig. 3 we plot the numerical result for

L over a wide range of δ-values. For reasonably small δ’s, applicable to most experimental

situations, the result is very well approximated by the present ﬁrst order calculation.

Our analytical approach has of course been limited to the case α = 5, which is non-

standard. Using the numerical procedure described above, it is a simple matter to obtain L

for arbitrary α. Fig.4 shows the result of this calculation in the limit of small δ. As to be

expected, the variation with α is not very strong. Large values of α correspond to a very

hard core.

Finally, it remains to compare our results to [19], who only took the long-ranged part of

the disjoining pressure into account. At the contact line, it was assumed that the solution

is a length scale characterizing the range of van-der-Waals forces. Thus, using (12) the result

of [19] can be converted to

which is essentially the same result as (34), but with a diﬀerent prefactor. In conclusion, for

both a slip and the present thin ﬁlm model, L is set by the respective microscopic length.

Here we describe how to determine the remaining constant of integration b2 in (29), by

shown above,

Hf = 1 − (ln(2)/4)δ + O(δ2),

and it is straightforward to see that the exponent is

γ = 2 + γ1δ + O(δ2),

γ1 = 9 ln(2)/4 − 1/8.

Thus at zeroth order in δ one ﬁnds ζ = 1 + ǫ exp(2ξ). On the other hand, the full static
proﬁle (16) gives 2(ξ − 1 + ln(2)/2) = ln(ζ − 1) + O(ζ − 1). Thus by comparing the two
proﬁles one identiﬁes ln(ǫ) = ln(2) − 2.

Expanding (35) to next order in δ leads to

H1 = − ln(2)/4 + γ1(ξ − 1 + ln(2)/2) exp[2ξ − 2 + ln(2)] =

(A.3)

− ln(2)/4 + γ1 ln(ζ − 1)(ζ − 1) + O(ζ − 1)2.

Thus in the limit of ζ → 1, (29) must have the same form as (A.3). The integrals in (29)

can be performed using Maple, and in the limit they give

H1 = − ln(2)/4 + (a + γ1 ln(ζ − 1)) (ζ − 1),

which matches (A.3) if a = 0. From this requirement we ﬁnally get

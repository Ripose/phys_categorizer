Abstract

We show that the decay of a passive scalar θ advected by a random in-
compressible ﬂow with zero correlation time in Batchelor limit can be mapped
exactly to a certain quantum-mechanical system with a ﬁnite number of de-
grees of freedom. The Schr¨odinger equation is derived and its solution is
analyzed for the case when at the beginning the scalar has Gaussian statistics
with correlation function of the form e−|x−y|2
. Any equal-time correlation
function of the scalar can be expressed via the solution to the Schr¨odinger
equation in a closed algebraic form. We ﬁnd that the scalar is intermittent
during its decay and the average of |θ|α (assuming zero mean value of θ) falls
as e−γαDt at large t, where D is a parameter of the ﬂow, γα = α(6 − α)/4 for
0 < α < 3, and γα = 9/4 for α ≥ 3, independent of α.

The problem of advection of a passive scalar (e.g., temperature or density of a pollutant)
by a random ﬂow has attracted considerable interest recently [1–5]. In many cases, the steady
state of the scalar exhibits the phenomenon of intermittency, i.e. violation of Gaussianity,
which, while being simpler than the Navier–Stokes intermittency [6], might well be the key
for the understanding of the latter.
In this paper, we consider the problem of turbulent
decay of a passive scalar, i.e. its advection without external injection, in the limit of very
large correlation length of the velocity (the Batchelor limit.) We show that the problem
can be reduced to the quantum mechanics of a system with a ﬁnite number of degrees of
freedom, which allows for the exact computation of any equal-time correlation function of
the scalar. For a particular, yet physically interesting, choice of the initial condition, the
number of relevant degrees of freedom of the eﬀective quantum theory is only three, and one
can easily ﬁnd all intermittency properties of the scalar during the decay. The method does
not rely on any phenomenological model or uncontrollable approximation.

The problem is to ﬁnd statistical properties of a scalar θ satisfying the equation [7]

(1)

(3)

∂tθ + vi∂iθ = κ∆θ

where vi is a Gaussian random ﬁeld which is white in time,

hvi(t, x)vj(t′, y)i = δ(t − t′)fij(r)

where r = |x − y|. In this paper we will consider only the case of three spatial dimensions.
For incompressible ﬂows, ∂ifij = 0. In the Batchelor limit [5,8], which corresponds to the
viscous-convective range in real turbulence at high Prandtl numbers, r is much smaller than
the correlation length of v, and

fij(r) = V δij − D(2δijr2 − rirj)

where r ≪ L ∼
V /D. L is assumed the largest length scale in the problem. At t = 0,
some distribution over conﬁgurations of θ is given as the initial condition (Eventually, we
will choose an initial condition where θ has Gaussian statistics with zero mean value, see
below.)

q

To attack the problem, we will reduce it to a certain problem of quantum mechanics,
which can then be solved. We ﬁrst note that the probability distribution functional of the
scalar, which will be denoted as Ψ[t, θ], can be expressed in term of a path integral [9]

Ψ[t, θ] =

Dπ(t, x) Dθ(t, x) Dvi(t, x) ρ[v] exp

where the Gaussian measure for the velocity ρ[v] is chosen to satisfy Eq. (2). The auxiliary
variable π enforces Eq. (1). Integrating over v, one obtains,

Ψ(t, θ) =

where θ and π are conjugate variables satisfying the usual commutation relation [θ(x), π(y)] =
iδ(x − y). The operator ordering in Eq. (5) corresponds to the physical regularization of
the path integral (4). The evolution of the distribution functional Ψ[θ] is described by the
Euclidean version of the Schr¨odinger equation, ∂tΨ = −HΨ. Note that the functional Ψ
itself, not its square, determines the probability distribution of θ. The average of, e.g., |θ|α is
deﬁned as h|θ|αi =
Dθ |θ|αΨ[θ]. In further discussion, we will use the quantum-mechanical
terminology, so the terms “probability distribution functional” and “wave function” are used
interchangeably.

R

In the Batchelor limit (3), the Hamiltonian can be simpliﬁed considerably. We will
concentrate our attention to the homogeneous case, i.e. when the system is invariant under
spatial translations. In the quantum language, this means that we restrict ourselves to the
dx π(x)∂iθ(x) [11]. With
states |Ψi having zero total momentum, Pi|Ψi = 0, where Pi =
this restriction, the Hamiltonian (5) can be rewritten into the following form,

R

H =

(4LijLij − LiiLjj − LijLji) + iκDii

(6)

D
2

where the operators Lij and Dij are deﬁned as follows,

Lij =

dx xiπ(x)∂jθ(x)

Dij =

dx π(x)∂i∂jθ(x)

Z

Z

The operator βijLij induces the linear coordinate transformation xi → xi + βijxj, while
e−iβijDij t can be understood as the operator inducing anisotropic diﬀusion βij∂i∂j during a
time interval t. Note that the Hamiltonian (6) is not Hermitian.

It is straightforward to check that Lij and Dij form a closed algebra with the commutation

relations,

[Lij, Lkl] = i(δjkLil − δliLkj)
[Lij, Dkl] = −i(δilDjk + δikDjl)
[Dij, Dkl] = 0

(7)

The fact that the algebra is closed implies that the system is actually one with a ﬁnite
number of degrees of freedom. The quantum ﬁeld theory, thus, degenerates to quantum
mechanics. Notice that Lij, as expected, form a GL(3,R) sub-algebra.
In fact, only the
SL(3,R) generators enter the Hamiltonian (6) (cf. [5].) H is invariant under the SO(3)
algebra formed by the anti-symmetric part of Lij.

In principle, the Schr¨odinger equation with H deﬁned in (6) can be solved (at least
numerically.) In this paper, we will choose a representation of the algebra (7) where H has
a relatively simple form, but the physics is non-trivial. Let us for a moment concentrate on
the states in which θ has Gaussian statistics. This corresponds to the wave functions of the
form Ψ[θ] ∼ exp(− 1
2 θ · K −1 · θ), where K(x − y) = hθ(x)θ(y)i. We will furthermore restrict

2

ourselves on functions K that have the Gaussian shape, K(x−y) ∼ exp(− 1
More strictly, we require that in Fourier components, the spectrum of θ has the form

2 bij(x−y)i(x−y)j).

where θ0 is a constant independent of aij = (bij)−1 (one can choose θ0 = 1.) Denote such
states as |aiji. The group elements act on |aiji as follows,

e−iβijLij |aiji = |e−βa(e−β)T i
e−iβijDij |aiji = |aij + 4βiji

if βii = 0

(8)

That the states |aiji transform between each other can be understood from the following
three remarks: (i) under linear coordinate transformations and anisotropic diﬀusion, the
Gaussian statistics is preserved, (ii) the Gaussian form of the correlation function K(x − y)
is also preserved, (iii) the coeﬃcient θ0, i.e. the strength of Fourier modes at low wavelengths,
does not change under the action of the group elements due to the incompressibility of the
ﬂow and the fact that diﬀusion does not aﬀects long-distance modes.

We now choose our representation to be the one acting on the subspace of the Hilbert
space that contains all linear combinations of |aiji (although the latter do not form an
orthogonal basis.) A vector in this subspace is characterized by the function ψ(aij) which
is the coeﬃcients of the expansion |Ψi =
daij ψ(aij)|aiji. In general, the scalar statistics
in |Ψi is not Gaussian. The operators Lij and Dij can be written as ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
operators with respect to aij, and the Schr¨odinger equation becomes a second-order PDE
on ψ.

R

Moreover, if the initial condition is isotropic, i.e. invariant under SO(3) rotations ǫijkLjk,
the wave function depends only on the eigenvalues of the matrix aij but not on the Eulerian
angles characterizing the orientation of the eigenvectors. The wave function is now a function
of 3 variables, ψ(u1, u2, u3), where we have denoted the eigenvalues of aij as e2ui. We re-scale
ψ so that the state |Ψi is expressed via ψ(u) as

|Ψi =

dui dU ψ(u)|a(u, U)i

Z

(9)

where a(u, U) = Udiag(e2ui)U −1, U belongs to SO(3), and the integration over U is per-
formed using the invariant measure on the SO(3) group manifold.

To derive the Schr¨odinger equation for ψ(u), it is simplest to use following technique.
Assume the wave function at the time moment t is ψ(t, u). The quantum state at time t+dt,
where dt is small, can be written as

|Ψ(t + dt)i =

where ∂i ≡ ∂/∂ui,

f1 ≡ f (u1; u2, u3) =

(e2u1 − e2u2)(e2u1 − e2u3)

,

f2 ≡ f (u2; u3, u1), f3 ≡ f (u3; u1, u2)

Eq. (11) is the Schr¨odinger equation in the chosen representation. Special caution is required
when two of ui are equal to each other, however this will not aﬀect our subsequent discussion.
To completely specify the problem, the initial condition on ψ(u) is needed. One can
take as the initial state the vector |aiji where aij = diag(1, 1, 1). This corresponds to a
scalar that has Gaussian statistics, zero mean value and the correlation function hθ(x)θ(0)i
proportional to e−x2/2 at t = 0. The correlation length of θ is taken to be of order 1. In
term of ψ, the initial condition is ψ(t = 0, u) = δ(u1)δ(u2)δ(u3).

Eq. (11) can be interpreted in an intuitive way by using a three-dimensional random

walk that has the Fokker–Planck equation coinciding with (11) [12]

where ξi are white noises that correlate as follows,

˙ui = 3Dfi + 2κe−2ui + ξi

ξ1 + ξ2 + ξ3 = 0

hξ1(t)ξ2(t′)i = hξ2(t)ξ3(t′)i = hξ3(t)ξ1(t′)i = −Dδ(t − t′)

Let us discuss the physical meaning of Eq. (13). A point (u1, u2, u3) corresponds to the
conﬁguration of θ having the spectrum h|θ(k)|2i ∼ exp(− 1
i ). In the conﬁguration
2
space, θ is approximately constant inside an ellipsoid with major axes proportional to eui.
When advected by the ﬂow, this ellipsoid is subjected to random linear transformations. If
the only transformations of the ellipsoids are those which stretch or compress the ellipsoid
in the directions of its major axes, the results would be ˙ui = ξi, where ξi are random.
Eq. (14) reﬂects the conservation of the volume of the ellipsoid during random stretching
and compressing. However, the ellipsoid may be subjected to stretching or compressing in
directions other than the major axes, as well as to shearing. These eﬀects are accounted for
by the term 3Dfi in the RHS of Eq. (13). The incompressibility is not violated, due to the
identity f1 + f2 + f3 = 0. The terms 2κe−2ui are not important unless one major axis of the
ellipsoid is as small as the diﬀusion scale. In the latter case, diﬀusion smears out the scalar
and makes it correlated on a larger distance. This is exactly the eﬀect of the 2κe−2ui terms
in the Langevin equation. Due to the sign of these terms, the volume of the ellipsoid, and
hence also u1 + u2 + u3, always grows during the random walk.

Since any correlation function can be computed for |aiji, where the scalar statistics is
Gaussian, one can ﬁnd any correlation function with respect to |Ψi if one knows the solution
to Eq. (11) (e.g., from numerical integration.) For example, the average of |θ|α (α > 0) over
the state |a(u, U)i is proportional to e−α(u1+u2+u3)/2, therefore its average with respect to
|Ψi is,

h|θ|αi = Cαhθ2(t = 0)i

where Cα = π−1/22α/2Γ( α+1

2 ). This relation is exact.

When κ is small, the exponential behavior of h|θ|αi can be found analytically. This can
be done by using the path-integral description of the random walk (13) and ﬁnding the
saddle-point trajectories that dominate |θ|α [13]. In this paper, we use a heuristic, yet more
physical, method to ﬁnd the large time behavior of h|θ|αi.

Let us assume that after letting the system (13) evolve for a while, the values of u1, u2,
and u3 become widely separated. We assume u1 < u2 < u3, and wide separation means
u2 − u1 ≫ 1, u3 − u2 ≫ 1. From Eq. (12) one sees immediately that in this regime, f1 = −1,
f2 = 0, f3 = 1.

Let us ﬁrst ignore the term proportional to diﬀusivity in Eq. (13). The velocity ˙ui
has two contributions: one from fi and another from the noise ξi. The ﬁrst contribution
implies that the mean values of ui drift with constant velocities, u1(t) = −3Dt, u2(t) = 0,
u3(t) = 3Dt, while the noises make ui ﬂuctuating around these mean values. The condition
of wide separation of u’s is satisﬁed when t ≫ D−1. The advection, in average, compresses
a ﬂuid element in one direction by a factor of e3Dt and stretches it in another direction by
the same factor. The remaining third direction is not substantially compressed or stretched.
In this regime, the diﬀusion is still not operative, and h|θ|αi remains constant.

At t = (6D)−1 ln κ−1 (≫ D−1 if κ is very small), the mean value of u1 becomes 1

2 ln κ. The
term κe−2u1 in the Langevin equation (13) cannot be ignored anymore. Physically, regions
of diﬀerent θ have been brought so close together so that diﬀusion is no longer negligible.
Let us consider the equation for u1, ˙u1 = −3D + 2κe−2u1 + ξ1, near umin = 1
2 ln κ. The ﬁrst
term in the RHS pushes u1 toward smaller values, while the second term prevents u1 from
becoming substantially smaller than umin. The variable u1, thus, ﬂuctuates around umin.
Therefore, the random walk becomes eﬀectively two-dimensional,

˙u3 = 3D + ξ3,

˙u2 = ξ2,
hξ2(t)ξ2(t′)i = hξ3(t)ξ3(t′)i = 2Dδ(t − t′)
hξ2(t)ξ3(t′)i = −Dδ(t − t′)

(15)

Additionally, it is required that u2 +u3 does not decrease with time, due to the previously
found fact that u1 + u2 + u3 can only increase (if u2 + u3 decreases, this means that u1 steps
away from the value u1 = umin.) Now there is a possibility for |θ|α to decay, since it is
proportional to e−α(u1+u2+u3)/2 but u1 + u2 + u3 is no longer a constant. Assuming that the
random walk (15) starts at u2 = u0
3, the distribution of u2 and u3 at large times
is Gaussian,

The mean value of |θ|α can be computed by taking the average of e−α(u2+u3)/2 over the distri-
du2 du3 ρ(u2, u3)e−α(u2+u3)/2
bution (16). Consider the case of 0 < α ≤ 3 ﬁrst. The integral
is dominated by the region near u2 − u0

average is proportional to e−γαDt, where γα = α(6 − α)/4.

Notice that the region where the integral is saturated has u2 decreasing with time,
2 Dt. Eventually, u2 will become as small as umin, and the term κe−2u2 in
u2 = u0
the Langevin equation becomes important. Now both u1 and u2 ﬂuctuate around umin.

However, as we will explain, the exponential decay law does not change. Indeed, when u1 and
u2 remain approximately constant, the evolution of u3 is described by the one-dimensional
random walk,

˙u3 = 3D + ξ3,

hξ3(t)ξ3(t′)i = 2Dδ(t − t′)

The distribution of u3 is now ρ(u3) ∼ exp(−(4Dt)−1(u3 − u0
2 − 3Dt)2). Taking the average
of e−αu3/2 (which is proportional to h|θ|αi since u1 and u2 are constant), one ﬁnds that the
decay law is still e−γαDt where γα = α(6 − α)/4.

For the particular case α = 2, our result can be checked against the calculations based
on the exact evolution equation for the scalar spectrum [7]. This comparison has been done,
the results indeed agree.

2Dt and u3 ∼ 3

When α > 3, the solution u2 ∼ − α

2 Dt, u3 ∼ (3 − α
2 )Dt is no longer realizable, since it has
decreasing u2 + u3. The average of |θ|α is then determined by the edge of the distribution
function, i.e. by u2 ∼ − 3
2Dt, or, after u2 reaches umin, u2 ≈ umin and
u3 ∼ const. The expectation value decays as e−9Dt/4. The reason why the decay law does
not contain α is the following: when α ≥ 3, the main contribution to |θ|α comes from the
realizations in the statistical ensemble where θ is unaﬀected by diﬀusion (i.e. the ellipsoid
in which θ is approximately constant has never been too thin during its evolution.) The
average h|θ|αi, thus, is determined by the probability of such realizations, which depends
only on characteristics of the ﬂow but not on α. This probability, as has been found, falls
as e−9Dt/4.

More careful analysis shows that the decay law e−γαt/4 that we have found is valid only
at large enough t. At intermediate t, there is a smooth transition from h|θ|αi = const to
h|θ|αi ∼ e−γαDt [13]. The full analysis does not change the long-time tail of h|θ|αi.

In conclusion, we have shown that by mapping to quantum mechanics, the problem of
turbulent decay of a randomly advected scalar in Batchelor limit can be made completely
solvable. The power of the approach described in this paper is not limited to the calculations
of h|θ|αi, analogous calculations can be done for any equal-time correlation function. For
example, the long-time tail of h|∂xθ|αi is also e−γαDt with the same γα. The results obtained
by this approach raise hope that there might exist an analytic treatment of the scalar
intermittency problem.

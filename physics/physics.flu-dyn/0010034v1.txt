Abstract

Nonlinear plane acoustic waves propagating through a ﬂuid are studied using

Burgers’ equation with ﬁnite viscosity. The evolution of a simple N-pulse with

regular and random initial amplitude and of pulses with monochromatic and noise

carrier is considered. In the latter case the initial pulses are characterized by two

length scales. The length scale of the modulation function is much greater than the

period or the length scale of the carrier. With increasing time the initial pulses are

deformed and shocks appear. The ﬁnite viscosity leads to a ﬁnite shock width, which

does not depend on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse and is fully determined by

the shock position in the zero viscosity limit. The other eﬀect of nonzero viscosity

is the shift of the shock position from the position at zero viscosity. This shift, as

well as the linear time, at which the nonlinear stage of evolution changes to the

linear stage, depends on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse. It is also shown that

the nonlinearity of the medium leads to generation of a nonzero mean ﬁeld from an

initial random ﬁeld with zero mean value. The relative ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld is

investigated both at the nonlinear and the linear stage.

1 Introduction

The propagation of ﬁnite amplitude sound waves is of fundamental interest in nonlinear

acoustics. In the simplest model of propagation in ﬂuids these waves are described by the

well-known Burgers’ equation (plane waves) [1, 2] or modiﬁcations of Burgers’ equation,

which are called generalized Burgers’ equations (cylindrical and spherical waves) [3–5].

In studies of nonlinear wave propagation an important problem is to ﬁnd the waveform

of the asymptotic wave at long time after the preparation of the initial wave or at long

distance from the source emitting the wave.

In the ﬁrst case the asymptotic wave is

called the old-age wave and is an asymptotic solution of an initial value problem of some

wave equation and in the latter case the asymptotic wave is a solution of a boundary

wave problem. The asymptotic wave is damped both by absorption and by shock wave

dissipation and the asymptotic wave is therefore, for plane waves, described by the linear

diﬀusion equation. Because the linear diﬀusion equation describes the attenuation of high

frequency waves, the asymptotic behaviour is determined by the spectrum of the waves of

low frequencies. This spectrum is the result of the distortion of the wave at the nonlinear

stage.

The decay of a wave to the old-age waveform is very diﬀerent for periodic signals

and pulse perturbations. For the periodic signal the old-age waveform is an exponen-

tially decaying harmonic wave. The pulse perturbation has continuous spectrum and the

amplitude of the pulse decays according to a power law.

For sinusoidal and N-wave initial perturbations the old-age solutions have been studied

in several papers for plane, cylindrical and spherical waves with use of both analytical

and numerical methods [6–15]. The dependence of the amplitude constant of the old-age

waveform on the parameters of the initial perturbations has been found.

The aim of the present paper is to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of complex

pulses, such as modulated or random waves. Plane waves are studied, which means that

we will use the original form of Burgers’ equation [1]. Burgers’ equation has an exact

solution, which is found by reducing it to the linear diﬀusion equation by mean of the

3

Hopf-Cole transformation [16, 17]. Because of the existence of an exact solution it is

relatively easy to ﬁnd the old-age waveform developing from simple initial perturbations

like periodic signals and N-waves in the plane wave case. However, for signals with complex

structure it is far from trivial to ﬁnd their evolution even for plane waves [18–20]. For

a regular signal with fractal structure [18, 20] an unusual sequence of stages of evolution

may appear: the nonlinear stage may succeed the linear stage. At the nonlinear stage

this wave may decrease more slowly than a periodic wave or a simple pulse.

Still more complicated behaviour is shown by a random signal. The solution of Burgers’

equation with random initial conditions is often called Burgers turbulence. Numerous

papers are devoted to investigations of this problem [22–27].

In the case of vanishing

viscosity the continuous random initial ﬁeld is transformed into a sequence of straight lines

with some slope and with random locations of the shocks separating them. Due to the

merging of the shocks the internal scale of the turbulence increases and the random wave

decreases more slowly than the periodic signal. The decay rate depends on the behaviour

of the initial energy spectrum of low frequency [21,26] and is also sensitive to the statistics

of the potential of the initial velocity ﬁeld [22, 26, 27]. The asymptotic behaviour of the

ﬁeld in the case of ﬁnite viscosity also depends strongly on the statistical properties of the

initial ﬁeld. In the case where there are large scale components in the initial spectrum the

nonlinear stage never transforms to the linear regime of evolution [21]. In the opposite

case the ﬁnal evolution depends on the tail of the initial probability distribution [23].

In the present paper we consider the evolution of complex pulses which are character-

ized by two scales: l0 - the inner scale of the carrier, L0 - the scale of the modulation,

and the condition L0 >> l0. For such signals the generation of a low-frequency com-

ponent or a non-zero mean ﬁeld takes place. The case of vanishing viscosity has been

investigated [29, 31]. It has been shown that, after multiple merging of the shocks, the

inner structure disappears and ﬁnally a ﬁnite pulse ends up with an N-wave. This N-wave

is fully described by the positions of its zero and shocks, which are determined by the
potential ψ0(x) of the initial velocity v0(x): v′0(x) = −ψ0(x).
that, for a pulse with random carrier, the ﬂuctuations of the positions of the zero and the

shocks are relatively small for l0 << L0.

In the present paper we will consider the inﬂuence of ﬁnite viscosity on the nonlinear

stage of the evolution of the pulse and investigate its old-age behaviour. The paper is

organized as follows.

In section 2, on the base of the Hopf-Cole solution, the asymptotic behaviour of the

pulse at the nonlinear and the old-age stages is analyzed in general terms without assuming

the detailed structure of the initial pulse.

In section 3 the evolution of simple N-waves with regular and random amplitude is

discussed.

Section 4 deals with pulses with monochromatic carrier and section 5 with pulses with

noise carrier. It is shown that the parameters of the asymptotic waveform depend weakly

on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse, but that the old-age behaviour is very sensitive

to the properties of the carrier.

(6)

The main goal of the present paper is the investigation of the old-age behaviour of

the localized pulses. But ﬁrst we discuss shortly the asymptotic evolution of nonlocalized
waves. Consider a group of perturbation with the bounded initial potential |ψ0(x)| < ∞
assuming that ψ0(x) is a periodic signal with a period L0 or homogeneous noise with rather

fast decreasing probability distribution of the potential ψ0. For such a perturbation in
U(x, t) (3) we separate a constant component ¯U:

U(x, t) = ¯U + ˜U (x, t) .

(7)

Inserting (7) into (3) we see that ¯U does not depend on time, since the y-integral of
G(x, y, t) is unity. Here ˜U (x, t) is a ﬁeld with zero mean value (on the period or statisti-

cally for noise). As times goes on, the viscous dissipation and oscillation (inhomogenity)
smoothing causes the amplitude (variance) of the ﬁeld ˜U (x, t) to become less. At times
when it amounts to | ˜U| ≪ ¯U the solution (2) is equal to

v(x, t) = −2ν

˜Ux(x, t)

¯U

.

(8)

As ˜U (x, t) satisﬁes the linear diﬀusion equation, then v(x, t) also at these times fulﬁls the

linear equation. This testiﬁes precisely to the fact that the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld

enters the linear stage. The accumulated nonlinear eﬀects are described in this solution

by the nonlinear integral relation between the initial velocity ﬁeld v0(x) and the ﬁelds
˜U(x, 0), ¯U (5,6), and are characterized by the value |△ψ0|/ν ∼ Re0.

6

Here △ψ0 is the characteristic change in amplitude of ψ0, and Re0 is the initial

Reynolds number.

From (8) it is easy to get the well known result, that for Re0 ≫ 1 the initial harmonic
waves asymptotically has also harmonics form, but with the amplitude not depending on

the initial amplitude [2, 3].

At large initial Reynolds number the homogeneous Gaussian ﬁeld v0(x) at the non-

linear stage transforms into series of sawtooth waves with strong nongaussian statistical

properties [21,25]. Nevertheless at very large time, when the relation (8) is valid, the dis-

tribution of the random ﬁeld v(x, t) with statistically homogeneous initial potential ψ0(x)

converges weakly to the distribution of the homogeneous Gaussian random ﬁeld with zero

mean value, and universal covariance function [23]. But the amplitude of this function

is nonlinearly related to the initial covariance function of the ﬁeld v0(x) and increases

proportionally exp(Re2

0) with increasing of initial Reynolds number Re0 [21, 23].

Let us consider the opposite situation when the initial perturbation is localized in
some region. We assume also that initial potential ψ0(x) vanishes very fast for x → ∞,
so we have

ψ0(x) = 0 ,

|x| > L
∗

,

(9)

where L
∗

can be considered as the length of initial pulse. The condition (9) is identical

to the assumption that the integral over the initial pulse is zero.

It should be stressed that if the integral over the initial pulse is △ψ0 6= 0, then the
initial perturbation transforms to the unipolar pulse with area △ψ0 asymptotically. For
Re0 = △ψ0/ν ≫ 1 the form of this pulse is close to the triangular with the width of shock
δ(t) ∼ νt/xs much smaller than the length of the pulse xs = q2|△ψ0|t. For such a pulse
δ(t)/xs ∼ Re−1
evolution prevails for all times.

0 = const and does not depend on time. Thus the nonlinear stage of the

Let us now consider the time asymptotic behaviour of initially localized pulse which

satisﬁes (9). If we rewrite (3) as

U(x, t) = 1 +

(10)

then we can see that because of (9) the integrand at right hand side of (10) is zero outside
the region |y| < L

G(x, y, t) is

. It is seen from (4) that the length scale ldif (t) of Green’s function

ldif = √2νt .

(11)

(12)

If the length scale of U0(y) is called LU , and the following condition

ldif (t) ≫ LU

is valid, then Green’s function can be considered as constant in the interval where the

integrand at the right hand side of (10) is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. Thus we obtain

from (10) using (5)

U(x, t) ≈ 1 + G(x, y∗(x, t), t)B .

(13)

Here y∗(x, t), |y∗| < L

(10) gives the essential contribution in the integral. In (13) we introduce the notation

(14)

(15)

If the initial pulse ψ0 is centered around y = 0, and the large scale of the ﬁeld v(x, t) is

much greater then L

v(x, t) =

instead of (15). For large initial Reynolds number Re0 = A/2ν, where A > 0 is the

maximum of ψ0(y), the constant B (14) may be rewritten as the product of the maximum

of the integrand and some length: Lef f

B = Lef f eA/2ν , Re0 = A/2ν ,

For large but ﬁnite Reynolds number the solution (18), completed with a solution valid

at x near xs and exhibiting the shock structure, is valid only at ﬁnite time. For ﬁnite t

(27)

Because (24) gives a solution of the linear diﬀusion equation, the condition (27) deﬁnes

the linear stage of the pulse evolution. On this stage the pulse energy is

E(t) = B2r ν

8πt3 .

(28)

Thus at the linear stage of evolution of the pulse has a universal form (26) and is

determined only by the constant B, which is deﬁned by the initial perturbation by the

relation (14). The case B = 0 can be understood by comparing the deﬁnition of B

according to the equations (14) and (5) with the formulas (30) - (33) in ref.

[19]. By

this comparison it is clearthat the case B = 0 corresponds to the absence of the Fourier

component with n = 1 in the terminology of ref. [19]. The Fourier component with n = 0
is absent here already for B 6= 0. The case B = 0 excludes the N-wave solution (19).

Below we will consider three cases of initial perturbation, assuming that the initial

potential may be written in the form

ψ0(x) = M(x)F (x) ,

(29)

where M(x) has the scale L0 ≃ L

the wellknown solution (see ref. [30]) for the N-wave. The cases of monochromatic and

noise carrier will be considered in Sections 4 and 5. In these cases we assume that the
scale l0 of the carrier F (x) satisﬁes the condition l0 ≪ L0 and then
f (x) = −F ′(x) .

(59)

For the negative A the pulse decays much faster than for A > 0. For ν → 0 at t > tM nl

the initial pulse transforms into so called S-wave [2, 31], and the energy becomes

E(t) =

25/2
3

L3
0
t2

,

(60)

which is independent of the initial amplitude |A| of the pulse. Of course the reason why
the energy of the S-wave decreases faster with t than the energy of the N-wave is that the

length of the N-wave increases with growing t in contrast to the S-wave.

At large Reynolds number |A|/2ν ≫ 1 the constant B (14) which determines the

linear stage of evolution is

B = −23/2L0

(61)

and much smaller than for positive A with the same Reynolds number. The region of

validity of linear regime is obtained from (25) and (61) as

t ≫ L2

0/ν .

(62)

Thus for the pulses with negative A the linear stage begins much earlier than for the

pulses with positive A, for which the linear time tM lin (59) increases exponentionally with

the Reynolds number Re0 = A/2ν.

Nevertheless, we can see on this simple example the main nontrivial properties of the

old-age behavior of the pulses in the case of large Reynolds number.

In the limit of vanishing viscosity (ν → 0) the energy of the pulse (21),(52) and the
shape of the pulse (19),(20),(41) do not depend on the length of L0 asymptotically for
t → ∞. They are determined only by the maximum of initial potential ψ0 (in our case
– of the area of triangular pulse of initial pulse A). Nevertheless, at the linear stage the

energy depends not only of A, but is also proportional to L2

0 (53). We can remark that

the energy of initial pulse is proportional to A2/L0.

The other property that we stress is that the amplitude B (17),(45) of the wave at

the old-age stage depends exponentially on the amplitude A of the initial pulse. For

small wave numbers k the Fourier component C(k, t) of the pulse depends linearly on
k: C(k, t) ∼ b(t)k. At the linear stage the slope b(t) of the Fourier component does not

16

depend on time: b(t) ≃ B = const. At the nonlinear stage the growing of the slope until
the very large linear time (59) leads to an exponentionally large value (in 1/ν) of b(t) at

the linear stage (cf.(45)).

3.2 The decay of an N-wave with random amplitude

Let us discuss the evolution of N-wave (33) with random initial amplitude. We assume

that the amplitude A in (31) has a gaussian probability distribution function with a zero

mean value

W (A) =

1

e−A2/2σ2

ψ .

(63)

q2πσ2

ψ

From (33) it is easy to see that mean initial ﬁeld hv0(x)i is zero, and relative ﬂuctuation
of the energy (52) at t = 0 is

δE(0) = hE2(0)i − hE(0)i2

hE(0)i2

= 2 .

(64)

In the previous section it was shown that there is strong diﬀerence between the decay
of the pulse with positive and negative amplitude A. If we introduce ¯E+(t) – the mean
energy of pulse with positive amplitude A (N-wave), and ¯E
−

(t) – the mean energy of

pulse with negative amplitude A (S-wave), then at time

t ≫ tM,nl ≃ L2

0/σψ

from (52), (60) and (63) we have

¯E+(t)/ ¯E
−

(t) ≃ (σψt/L2

0)3/2 ≃ (t/tM,nl)3/2 ≫ 1.

(65)

(66)

This fast decrease of pulses with negative A will lead to the generation of a ﬁeld with
positive mean value hv(x, t)i from an initial ﬁeld v0(x) with zero mean value hv0(x)i = 0.
At time t ≫ tM,nl (65) we can neglect the inﬂuence of the negative pulse on the mean
ﬁeld and use the expressions (19),(20) for the velocity. In diﬀerent realizations we will

have the N-wave with the same slope v′x = 1/t and random position of the shocks.

(70)

(71)

(72)

At small x < (σψt)1/2 the mean ﬁeld hv(x, t)i is half the regular ﬁeld with A ∼ σψ,
due to the fact that only in that half of realizations, in which A > 0, we have a relatively
slowly decaying N-wave. The mean ﬁeld hv(x, t)i (71) has not a clear stressed shock front

The situation radically changes on the linear stage when the ﬁeld is described by the

equation (26). At this stage we have the self-similar evolution of the ﬁeld

where ¯Vlin(y) is deﬁned as

and B is a random amplitude (45) with nonzero mean value. For the gaussian distribution

of F in (29) we have from (14)

hBi =

−∞ (cid:16)eM 2(x)Re2

0/2 − 1(cid:17) dx.

Here we introduce the eﬀective Reynolds number Re0

Re0 = hF 2(x)i1/2/2ν = σψ/2ν.

(79)

(80)

From (79) we see that mean value hBi does not depend on the ﬁne structure of the carrier
f (x) and is always positive. The positive mean value hBi is a result of generation of mean
ﬁeld at the nonlinear stage. Here we consider the case of large Reynolds number, where

we can use the asymptotic expression for B (45). The n-th moment of B will be expressed

through the probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of A (63):

hBni = (4πL2

(82)

Thus we have very fast growing of the momentum with increasing n. From (77) one can

see that at the linear stage both mean ﬁeld and variance are self-similar, and that the

relative integral ﬂuctuation δv2 does not depend on t. But in contrast to the nonlinear

stage (76), in the linear stage the relative integral ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld δv2 is extremely

large for large Reynolds number:

δv2 = hB2i − hBi2

hBi2

(83)

We have similar behaviour also for the relative ﬂuctuation of the energy δE(t) (64).

At the nonlinear stage at σψt ≫ L2

0 we have from (21), (63), (64)

δE(t) =

2√π
Γ2(5/4) − 1 ≃ 3.376 .

(84)

Thus at the nonlinear stage δE(t) does not depend on the initial scale L0 and the

variance σψ of the p.d.f. of amplitude A.

At the linear stage the ﬂuctuation of the energy is determined by the fourth and

the second moment of B, and from (82) we have also a strong enhancement of energy

ﬂuctuation (84)

δE(t) =

4 The evolution of a pulse with monochromatic car-

rier

In this section we consider the evolution of a pulse with monochromatic carrier

ψ0(x) = M(x)A cos k0x,

v0(x) ≃ M(x)a0 sin k0x.

(86)

Here A = a0/k0, and we assume that the length scale L0 of the modulation function M(x)

is much greater then the period l0 of the carrier (l0 = 2π/k0). Below we consider two

20

large parameters Re0 = A/2ν and L0/l0. For diﬀerent ratios of these parameters we have

diﬀerent regimes of wave evolution.

The pure monochromatic signal (M(x) ≡ 1) is characterized by the nonlinear time
ts,nl = 1/a0k0 (”s” stands for ”signal”) and the linear time ts,lin = 1/νk2
0 [21]. At ts,nl ≪
t ≪ ts,lin (Re0 ≫ 1) the monochromatic wave transforms into the sawtooth wave with
the slope v′x = 1/t. The shock amplitude △V = l0/2t, as well as the energy of the wave
E = l2

0/12t2, does not depend on the initial amplitude. The shockwidth

δ = 2ν/△V = 4νt/l0

(87)

increases with time, and is, at t ∼ ts,lin, of the same order as a period. For t ≫ ts,lin
we have the linear regime of evolution, where the wave form is sinusoidal again with
exponentionally decaying amplitude v(x, t) = 2νk0 exp[−νk0t2]sin k0x.

For a pulse with monochromatic carrier a large-scale component vl(x, t) is generated.

The interaction of the high frequency component with the large-scale wave vl(x, t) will

change the evolution of the carrier.

4.1 The nonlinear stage of evolution at large Reynolds number

Below we give a short summary of pulse evolution at ν → 0 based on the paper [31], and
discuss the inﬂuence of ﬁnite dissipation on the evolution of large scale and high frequency

carrier.

The nonlinear eﬀect leads to the generation of the large-scale component vl(x, t), and

at t ≫ ts,nl this component obtains the stationary form

vl(x, t) = −M′(x) A,

(88)

which is equal to the form of simple pulse v0(x) = M′(x)A with the same initial potential

ψ0(x) = M(x) A. The evolution of the large-scale component is characterized by the

nonlinear time tM,nl = L2

0/A (51), and (88) is valid for t ≤ tM,nl. At time

tint =

L0l0
A

21

(89)

the energy of large-scale and small-scale components are of the same order. At t ≫ ts,nl
the evolution of the large-scale component is equal to the evolution of a simple pulse with

ψ0(x) = M(x) A.

For M(x) = (1 − x2/2L2
0),

|x| < √2L0 the evolution of the large-scale component
is described by the expressions (41), (42), (52). At t ≫ ts,nl, in the limit ν → 0, the
evolution of the large-scale component is determined by only one parameter A = a0/k0 of

the initial perturbation.

At t ≫ ts,nl the amplitudes △V of the shocks of the small-scale components do not
depend on the initial amplitude: △V = l0/2t, but due to the interaction with large-scale
component they have nonzero velocity Vr ≃ −A M′(xr) = vl(xr) (88), where xr is the
initial position of the shock. The distance between the shocks increases with time as

l(t) = l0(1 + At/L2

0).

(90)

The collision of the shocks of small-scale components moving with constant velocity of

ﬁne structure with shocks of the large-scale structure (42) leads to decrease of the number

of shocks (see ﬁg. 3 from [31]). The last collision occurs at time t =

this time a pure N-wave remains.

At ﬁnite Reynolds number the width of the shocks of the large-scale component in-

creases with time (87). The linear spreading of small structure leads to the increase of the

distance between the shocks (90). Comparing (87) with (90) we ﬁnd that, if the initial

Reynolds number satisﬁes the condition

(91)

then the nonlinear structure of shocks will be conserved. This is because the relative

the nonlinear structure will dissipate before the nonlinear distortion of large-scale com-

ponent begins.

The evolution of the large-scale component at ﬁnite Reynolds number will be described

by the same equations as the evolution of a simple wave (47) - (49). Only the position

of the shocks xs(t) will be determined by some other equation (23), where Lef f depends

on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse. This dependence leads to the sensitivity of the

old-age behaviour on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse.

4.2 Old-age linear stage evolution of pulse with monochromatic

carrier

The ﬁnal linear stage of evolution is described by the equation (26), where the constant

B (14) is now given by

B =

+∞Z
{exp [Re0M(x)cos k0x − 1] dx}.

−∞

(94)

At large Reynolds number Re0 = A/2ν the constant B may be written in the form

B = Lef f exp[Re0] (17). In fact for the large Reynolds number the main contribution in

the integral in (94) comes from the neighborhood of points yr = l0r (l0 = 2π/k0, r =
0,±1,±2, ...). An evaluation of B by the steepest descent method then gives

From (95) we see that the prefactor Lef f in (17) strongly depends on the ratio of two

large numbers: the Reynolds number Re0 and the number L2

0/l2

0 (l0 = 2π/k0). When the

relation (91) is valid, then only the ﬁrst term r = 0 in (95) is signiﬁcant, and from (17),

(95) we have

In the case of moderate Reynolds number, when the condition (93) is valid, we have

Lef f =

l0√2πRe0

.

(96)

from (17,95)

Lef f =

L0
Re0

.

23

(97)

√2π

B = Xr

k0qRe0M(yr)

exp[Re0M(yr)].

(95)

The results above should be compared with expression (45) of B for the simple pulse

for which we have Lef f = L0q2π/Re0. One can see that the modulation leads to faster

transformation of the wave into the linear regime of evolution and consequently to decrease
of the amplitude of the wave (B ∼ Lef f exp[A/2ν]) at the old-age stage.

5 The evolution of a pulse with noise carrier

In this section we will study the evolution of a pulse with noise carrier f (x) = −F ′(x)
(30). We assume that the potential F (x) is homogeneous gaussian noise with rapidly

decreasing covariance function

Bψ(ρ) = hF (x)F (x + ρ)i = σ2

ψR(ρ) = σ2

ψ 1 −

ρ2
2l2

+ ...! .

(98)

In the limit of vanishing viscosity the continuous homogeneous ﬁeld v0(x) = f (x)

transforms into sequence of sawtooth pulses with equal slope v′x = 1/t and with random

position of shocks. Due to the collision and merging of the shocks, their number decreases

and the characteristic scale of random ﬁeld increases. This eﬀect makes all the statistical

properties of the ﬁeld self-similar and they are determined by only one scale l(t), which

can be interpreted as characteristic distance between the zeroes of v(x, t) or between the

shocks [21, 25, 26].

The evolution of the integral scale l(t) in time due to merging of the shocks ( [21], see

eq. 4.15, p. 170)

l(t) = (σψt)1/2ln−1/4  tσ2

ψ = hF 2(x)i, σ2

v = σ2

0 = hf 2(x)i.

(99)

(100)

Here l0 is the correlation length of the initial potential. Due to the merging of the shocks
the energy density of the random wave hv2(x, t)i = l2(t)/t2 ∼ t−1 decreases slower then
the energy of harmonic perturbation.

24

In case of the ﬁnite Reynolds number the thickness of the shock in the sawtooth wave

originating from a monochromatic wave is given in (87). We have the same expression
for a random wave as well, where △V is the random amplitude of the shock. For the
estimations we can assume △V ∼ l(t)/t.

The ratio between the integral scale l(t) and internal scale δ(t) is the eﬀective Reynolds

number Re(t):

Re(t) ≈

l(t)
δ(t) ≈

l(t)△V (t)

ν

∼ Re0 ln−1/2(cid:18) t

tnnl(cid:19) ,

where Re0 and tn,nl (”n” stands for ”noise”) are deﬁned as

Re0 = σψ/2ν,

tn,nl = l2

0/σψ.

(101)

(102)

Thus the eﬀective Reynolds number Re(t) logarithmically slowly decreases with time,
and the linear stage of evolution starts at very large time tn,lin ≃ tn,nl exp(Re2
0) ≫ tn,nl,
(Re(tn,lin) ∼ 1). At this time the nonlinear eﬀects become unimportant and the noise
enters into the linear mode where its damping is mainly determined by linear dissipation.

On the base of the solution (8), as it was shown in [21], the energy decays as

σ2
v(t) = (νl2

0/t3)1/2Re1/2

0 eRe2
0.

(103)

At the linear stage the distribution of the random ﬁeld converges to the distribution

of the homogeneous Gaussian ﬁeld with zero mean velocity and variance according to

(103) [23].

The evolution of the pulse with noise carrier in the limit of vanishing viscosity (ν →

transforms to an N-wave. In the case, when the scale of the carrier l0 is much smaller

then scale of modulation function L0, it was shown that the ﬂuctuation of the shock

positions is relatively small.

Below we consider the properties of the pulse with noise carrier at the nonlinear stage

for ﬁnite Reynolds number and the old-age behaviour of the pulse.

25

5.1 Nonlinear stage of evolution of pulse with noise carrier

In the case of vanishing viscosity we can introduce two characteristic times: the nonlinear

time for noise carrier evolution tn,nl = l2

0/σψ and nonlinear time for modulation evolution
tM,nl = L2
0/σψ. At t ≫ tn,nl the initial wave transforms into the sequence of sawtooth
pulses, with the integral scale lM (x, t) ≃ M 1/2(x)l0(t/tn,nl)1/2 and the energy density
¯E(x, t) = l2
v (t/tn,nl)−1 depending slowly on the coordinate [31]. At

M (x, t)/t2 ≃ M(x)σ2

this stage the nonlinearity leads to partial depression of modulation and to generation
of the mean ﬁeld vl(x, t) = hv(x, t)i = −M′(x)σψ (ln M(x)t/2πtnnl)1/2 [31]. Due to the
merging of the shocks their number decrease, and at t ≫ tM,nl the initial pulse with
noise carrier transforms into an N-wave with random positions of zero and shocks. The
position of the N-wave zero is localized in an narrow region △l ≃ L0/(ln L2
the center of the initial pulse [31]. The position of the shocks are determined by the

0)1/2 near

0/2πl2

equation (20), where A = ψm is the value of absolute maximum of the initial potential

ψ0(x) (29). It was shown that the cumulated probability QH(H) = Prob(ψm < H) has

The mean velocity hv(x, t)i, with v(x, t) given by (68) and its variance σ2

v(x, t) are

described by equations (69), (70), where now the cumulative probability QH (H) is deter-

mined by equation (104), and not by the error function in (71). It is easy to see from (74)

that both mean ﬁeld and variance have self-similar behaviour. From (69) , (70), (104) we

have (cf. (74))

¯V (y, N) = y(1 − qN (y)), ¯σ2

(107)

Contrary to the case of the simple initial pulse (75), in the case of pulse with noise
carrier the mean ﬁeld and its variance have two diﬀerent scales for N ≫ 1 (see ﬁgs. 1
and 2). The two scales in the ”b” and ”c” curves in the ﬁgures are the width of the shock

and the length of the pulse. In the ”a” curves only the length of the pulse remains. For

realization is described by the expressions (48), (49). The shifting of the shock position

xs from the zero viscosity limit xs = √2ψmt (A ≡ ψm) is given in (23). At the nonlinear

stage we can neglect this shifting. Then in each realization we have self-similar evolution

of the pulse, and the relative width of the shock δ/xs = 2ν/ψm does not depend on time.
While for N ≫ 1 (L0 ≫ l0) the maximum ψm of the initial potential is localized in the
narrow region △H/H0 ≃ (ln N) near H0 ≃ σψ(2 ln N)1/2 ( [31] formulas (107), (113)), we
can estimate the relative width of shock front as

δ

(113)

Comparing (113) with (109) we see that the inﬂuence of ﬁnite viscosity on the mean ﬁeld

is unimportant if

 ln

≃ (ln N)1/2 ≪ Re0.

(114)

In the opposite case, for extremely large ratio L0/l0, the width of the mean ﬁeld will be

determined by the viscosity.

The displacements of shock position xs (23) from the vanishing viscosity position
ef f eψm/ν/ν

xs = √2ψmt leads ﬁnally to the depressing of nonlinear eﬀects. For t ≫ tlin ∼ L2

(cf.(27)) we have the linear stage of evolution. While for the random perturbation we have

a large ﬂuctuation of tlin, the cumulative action of nonlinearity, which is proportional to

tlin, leads to strong ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld at the linear stage.

5.2 Old-age linear stage of evolution of a pulse with noise carrier

At the old-age stage, when the evolution of the pulse is described by linear solution (26) all

the properties of the wave are determined by the constant B, given in (14). The potential

ψ0(x) (29) is a random Gaussian function. The mean value of B is given by the equation
(79), and does not depend on the ﬁne structure of the carrier. For Re0 = σψ/2ν ≫ 1 we
have from (82)

hBi = L0√2π

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of relatively large Reynolds number, when the integral

(14) may be calculated using the steepest descent method, and only the contribution of

the absolute maximum is important:

B = s 4πν
|ψ′′m|

eψm/2ν.

(116)

Here ψm = ψ0(xm) is the value of absolute maximum of ψ0, and ψ′′m = ψ′′0 (xm) is the

second derivative of the potential at this point. To ﬁnd the statistical properties of B we

need to know the joint probability distribution of ψm and ψ′′m. From (98) it is easy to
ﬁnd the correlation coeﬃcient for ψm and ψ′′m: r = −l2
probability distribution function W (ψ′′m/ψm), we then obtain for the conditional mean

0. If we consider the conditional

1/l2

value hψ′′miψm and variance (cid:16)σ2

m(cid:17)ψm

:

hψ′′miψm = −ψmrσ2

(117)

While B increases exponentionally with ψm only the maximum ψm ≫ σψ gives a signiﬁcant
contribution to the average characteristics of B. Thus in (116) we can substitute hψ′′miψm
(117) instead of ψ′′m, and so we have

B = l0s 4πν

ψm

eψm/2ν.

(118)

From (104) we have for the probability distribution function of the absolute maximum

of the initial potential ψ0(x):

WH (H) =

∂QH
∂H

(H)e−N∞(H).

This function is localized near

and has a tail for H → ∞:

H0 = σψ(2 ln N)1/2

WH(H) =

(119)

(120)

(121)

For the calculation of the moments of B we can use the steepest descent method using

the tail of the probability distribution function (121):

hBni = L0 ln−1

0 (cid:18)2π

n (cid:19)n/2 1

Ren

(122)

We have the main contribution for the n-th moment (122) at the point H

∗,n ≃ nσψ/2ν =
∗,n with H0 given in (120) we see that the inequality (114) is necessary

n Re0. Comparing H

for (122) to be valid.

Comparing (122) with the relation (82) for the moment of B for a simple pulse we see
that for the small-scale noise carrier the moments n ≥ 2 depend on the integral scale l0
of the carrier.

The relative integral ﬂuctuation δv2 of the ﬁeld (76) on this stage is expressed for two

ﬁrst moments of B as

δv2 = hB2i

hBi2 − 1 ≃

l0
L0

1
2

eRe2
0,

(123)

and when the condition (114) is valid it is very large in contrast to the nonlinear stage
(112), where δv2 ≪ 1. For the noise carrier with the scale l0 ≪ L0 the relative integral
ﬂuctuation is the small factor l0/L0 times the ﬂuctuation of the simple pulse with random

Gaussian amplitude (83).

The calculation of hBi,h△B2i may be done directly on the base of the integral (14),
and for large Reynolds number we have the same equation (123). For (l0/L0) ≪ exp[−Re2
0]
we have relatively small ﬂuctuation of δv2, and with increasing of l0/L0 the probability

distribution of B approaches slowly the normal distribution (normalization). This normal-

ization is similar to the normalization of the homogeneous ﬁeld at the old-age stage [23].

But while the moment Bn increases exponentionally with n, we have weak convergence

to the normal distribution of B like in [23].

6 Discussion and conclusion

We have investigated the evolution of pulses with complex structure in nonlinear media,

described by Burgers’ equation. The investigation for vanishing viscosity was done in our

30

paper [31]. There it was shown that the asymptotic form of an arbitrary initial pulse with

zero area is an N-wave. It was also shown that the shock positions of the N-wave are

determined by only one parameter of the initial perturbation - the value of the absolute
maximum of the initial potential ψ0(x) (v0(x) = −∂ψ0(x)/∂x). It was also shown in the
paper [31] that for the noise carrier the ﬂuctuations of the shock positions are relatively

small if the carrier length scale l0 is much smaller than the modulation length scale L0.

In the present paper we have considered the evolution of pulses with complex structure

at large but ﬁnite Reynolds number. On the base of the Hopf-Cole solution it is shown

that the ﬁnite viscosity leads to a ﬁnite shock width δ, which does not depend on the

ﬁne structure of the initial pulse and is fully determined by the shock position in the zero

viscosity limit. The other eﬀect is the shift of the shock position from the zero viscosity

limit position. This shift depends on the ﬁne structure of the initial pulse, and as a

consequence the time tlin, at which the nonlinear stage of evolution changes to the linear

stage, is determined not only by the value of the maximum of the initial potential but

also by the ﬁne structure of the pulse. Because the amplitude of the pulse at the linear

old-age stage is determined by the time tlin, the old-age amplitude is also sensitive to the

inner structure of the pulse.

In this paper the evolution of a simple N-pulse with regular and random initial ampli-

tude and of pulses with monochromatic and noise carrier is considered. It is shown that

the nonlinearity of the medium leads to the generation of a non-zero mean ﬁeld from an

initial random ﬁeld with zero mean value. It is also shown that, at the nonlinear stage,

the relative ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld and its energy is of unit order for simple pulses and

small for pulses with complex inner structure (l0 << L0). However, at the old-age linear

stage this ﬂuctuation increases exponentially with increasing initial Reynolds number.

The statistical properties of the local topology of two-dimensional turbulence are investigated
using an electromagnetically forced soap ﬁlm. The local topology of the incompressible 2D ﬂow
4 (ω2 − σ2), where ω(x, y) is the local
is characterized by the Jacobian determinant Λ(x, y) = 1
vorticity and σ(x, y) is the local strain rate. For turbulent ﬂows driven by diﬀerent external force
conﬁgurations, P (Λ) is found to be a universal function when rescaled using the turbulent intensity.
A simple model that agrees with the measured functional form of P (Λ) is constructed using the
assumption that the stream function, ψ(x, y), is a Gaussian random ﬁeld.

Geometrical and topological ideas have played impor-
tant roles in our understanding of turbulent phenom-
ena. For example the energy cascades of both three-
dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) turbulence
are generally pictured as hierarchical structures of inter-
acting eddies [1]. Although topological ideas ﬁnd wide
spread use in the interpretation of data and theory, they
are not generally used to analyze data and develop the-
ory. The reason for this is because there currently exist
no measurement technique for the extraction of entire
turbulent velocity ﬁelds from a 3D ﬂuid. Since the bulk
of turbulence experiments have been performed in 3D,
this lack of enthusiasm for topological approaches is an
artifact of limited data. In 2D, however, the situation is
more tractable since particle tracking can measure entire
2D velocity ﬁelds [2]. In this article the statistical prop-
erties of the local topology of 2D velocity ﬁelds extracted
from a turbulent soap ﬁlm are investigated.

the Jacobian determinant, Λ(x, y)

The local ﬂow topology in a 2D ﬂuid can be
determined, up to a coordinate transformation, by
two numbers:
≡
∂(vx, vy)/∂(x, y), and the divergence of the ﬂow ﬁeld,
v. Since the velocity ﬁelds under consideration are es-
∇ ·
sentially incompressible, the single ﬁeld Λ(x, y) uniquely
deﬁnes the ﬂow. This quantity lends itself to a simple
geometrical interpretation.
If Λ(x, y) < 0, then in the
reference frame of the ﬂuid at point (x, y) the ﬂow struc-
ture is similar to that shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a) and
is called a saddle. On the other hand, if Λ(x, y) > 0,
the ﬂow structure resembles that in the inset of Fig. 1(b)
and is called a center. If Λ(x, y) = 0, the local ﬁeld is
in either a state of pure shear, or more complicated non-
linear shear. The quantity Λ also plays a signiﬁcant role
other than measuring the local topology of a 2D ﬂuid.
If the 2D ﬂuid has density ρ and experiences external
forces that are divergence free, then Λ is proportional to
the Laplacian of the pressure ﬁeld, ∆p = 2ρΛ. Therefore
saddles are regions of locally high pressure, while centers
are regions of locally low pressure.

One can express Λ in terms of two more familiar quan-

tities, the vorticity ω and the strain rate σ:

where ω2 =
i,j(∂ivj +
∂jvi)2/2. Hence, regions of large positive Λ correspond
to strong vorticity, whereas regions of large negative Λ
correspond to strong elongation. Note that this is not
exclusive, meaning that saddle regions could also have
a large vorticity provided the local strain is still larger.
Similarly, centers could be strongly elongated as long as
their rotation rate exceeds the strain rate.

P

This article will investigate the probability P (Λ) that
a point in turbulent ﬂow is behaving as a saddle or a
center of a given strength. This will be done in 2D us-
ing an electromagnetically forced soap ﬁlm (e-m cell) [3].
Theoretical predictions of the behavior of P (Λ) are also
developed in this article and shown to be in agreement
with most of the features observed in the measurement.
A description of the operation of the e-m cell can be
found in [3] and will not be reviewed in depth here.
Brieﬂy, the e-m cell creates a state of energetically steady
turbulence in a 50 µm thick soap ﬁlm using electromag-
netic ﬁelds. Data from the e-m cell has been shown to be
consistent with exact predictions that can be made using
the forced 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation:

Here, v is the velocity ﬁeld, p is the internal pressure
ﬁeld normalized by the ﬂuid density, and F is the elec-
tromagnetic force ﬁeld acting on the ﬂuid. The constant
0.016 cm2/s is the kinematic viscosity. The last
ν
αv, accounts for the frictional eﬀect of
term in Eq. 2,
air acting on the soap ﬁlm. This system has two di-
mensionless control parameters which can be varied by
changing either the magnitude of F or α. The ﬁrst is
the Reynolds number deﬁned as Re = vrms/kinjν and
the second is the dimensionless air-friction γ = α/k2
inj ν.
Here kinj is a typical wavenumber describing the spatial
variation of the electromagnetic force ﬁeld, called the in-

values from 0.1 to 1, corresponding to a regime of weak
to moderate damping, and Re varies from 10 to 100.

To establish that the local topology measurements
are not merely a reﬂection of the geometrical aspects
of the external forcing two diﬀerent force conﬁgurations
were used. Both force ﬁelds were unidirectional with
Fy = 0. The Fx for each ﬁeld varied in diﬀerent spa-
tial patterns which will be called linear and square. Fx
is given by Fx = F0 sin(k0y) for the linear ﬁeld, and
Fx = F0 sin(k0y/√2) sin(k0x/√2) for the square ﬁeld.
For both cases, kinj = k0 = 2π/a, with a
0.6 cm for
the linear forcing and a
0.8 cm for the square forc-
ing. Unless otherwise noted the magnitude of the force
ﬁelds, F0, varied in time with a square waveform of 3 Hz.
Finally, topological aspects of decaying turbulence were
also investigated by driving the cell and suddenly switch-
ing oﬀ the drive. It is generally believed that decaying
turbulence is very diﬀerent from forced turbulence due
to the absence of an inverse energy-cascade range [4].

The velocity ﬁeld is measured by particle tracking ve-
locimetry [3], which typically yields 5000 velocity vectors
per image. Figure 1 is a typical Λ ﬁeld calculated from
a single velocity ﬁeld driven by the linear forcing with
vrms ≃
10 cm/s. For clarity, the distribution of centers
Λ > 0, denoted as Λ+, is plotted separately from the dis-
tribution of saddles Λ < 0, denoted as Λ−. Unlike the
velocity ﬁelds, which tend to be spatially extended, the
distribution of Λ appears to be localized or spotty, more
so for centers than for saddles.

Sequences of 400-500 Λ ﬁelds were acquired for various
values of γ and Re, and for diﬀerent types of forcing (see
Table I). From these, probability distribution functions
(PDF) of Λ were computed, and the results are shown in
Fig. 2. All of the PDFs have a strikingly similar form.

FIG. 2: (a) The distribution function P (Λ) for: (a) linearly
forcing with Re ≈ 60 and γ values of 0.28 (⋄), 0.56 (⊲) and
0.97 (◦), (b) square forcing with Re ≈ 80 and γ ≈ 0.6, and
(c) decaying turbulence at two separate times, 0.5 s (⊳) and
1.0 s (∆) after the forcing is turned oﬀ. All of these data sets
are plotted together in (d) after normalizing by the respective
Λrms.

One observes that the PDF is asymmetric with a nearly
exponential decay for Λ < 0 and an initially quick, per-
haps stretched exponential, decay for small Λ > 0, even-
tually relaxing to what appears to be exponential decay
for large Λ > 0. The anomalously long tail of the PDF
for Λ+ is consistent with the visual appearance of veloc-
ity ﬁelds in that powerful vortices are more conspicuous
than saddles in the ﬂow. Finally, we note that the PDF
is non-analytic at Λ = 0.

The PDFs in Fig. 2(a)-(c) can be collapsed on a single
master curve if Λ is normalized by its RMS value, x =
Λ/Λrms. As seen in Fig. 2(d), over four decades in the
vertical scale, the quality of the data collapse is excellent.
The agreement between decaying and driven turbulence

also indicates that P (Λ) is independent of the presence
or lack of an inverse cascade. These observations lead us
to believe that the functional form of P (Λ) is universal
for 2D turbulence, though the ﬂow appears to be visually
diﬀerent.

The universal nature of P (Λ) indicates that the prob-
ability distribution can be understood from basic prin-
ciples and minimal models without requiring a detailed
model of the ﬂow. Since the experiment approximates
2D incompressible ﬂow, the velocity can be written in
terms of a stream function ψ(x, y) with vx = ∂yψ and
∂xψ. The Jacobian determinant is then Λ =

To understand the PDF in the turbulent regime, we
need a further assumption. The simplest assumption is
that the stream function is a Gaussian random ﬁeld. The
derivatives of a Gaussian ﬁeld are also Gaussian so that
∂xvx, ∂yvy, ∂yvx and ∂xvy are all Gaussian random ﬁelds
with their cumulants given by 4th order derivatives of
M (u, w). Hence it is straightforward to calculate P (Λ),
since Λ is a functional of Gaussian ﬁelds.

Hence b is the normalized correlation of the shear strain
rates in the diﬀerent directions and is the only parameter
that aﬀects the shape of P (Λ). In principle b is a free
parameter. However, if M (u, w) has elliptical symmetry,
that is M (u, w) = M (u2 + cw2) where c is a constant, b
assumes the value 1/3.

Introducing a rescaled Λ via Λ′ = Λ/ ˜Λ, the PDF can

be written in terms of an integral [5]:

where Φc is the complemetary error function. The dif-
ferent lower limits of integration, rmin, for positive and
negative Λ′ makes P (Λ) asymmetric and non-analytic at
zero. For negative Λ′, P (Λ′) is exponential while for pos-
itive Λ′, P (Λ′) has a non-exponential behavior for small
Λ′ followed by an exponential decay at large Λ′. The
asymptotic exponential decay rates k± can be obtained

for general b with k+ = 1/(1 + b) and k− = 1/(2b). Since
b < 1, k > k+ and the asymptotic decay is faster for
negative Λ′.

To test this model, b was measured directly from the
experimental ﬂow ﬁelds and found to be close to the ex-
pected value of 1/3; ranging between a low value of 0.3
for linear forcing to a high value of 0.4 for the square
forcing (see Table I). The scaled PDF determined from
Eq. 6 for b = 1/3 together with the experimental PDFs
are displayed in Fig. 4. The assumption that the stream
function is a Gaussian ﬁeld captures all the main features
of the experimental PDF. In particular, the theory repro-
duces the asymmetry between positive and negative Λ,
and the exponential form of P (Λ) for negative Λ. For

Λ > 0, the theory predicts the pronounced curvature on
the semi-log plot in agreement with the experiment. For
larger Λ the theory predicts that the PDf decays more
slowly for positive than for negative Λ in agreement with
observations. However, the experiment shows a much
more pronounced curvature in the large positive Λ tail
than the Gaussian model. This may indicate a break-
down of the Gaussian assumption in regions of large vor-
ticity.

P (Λ) is non-analytic at Λ = 0 and decays more slowly
for positive Λ or the centers. This is evidenced by the
ratio
2.5. The non-analytic nature
stems from the fact that centers and saddles are topolog-
ically distinct and cannot transform continuously from
one to the other. The experimental ﬁndings reported
here are universal, independent of turbulent intensity and
the means of turbulence generation. That this behavior
is universal may be linked to the fact that Λ is a lo-
cal quantity and therefore insensitive to the long-range
spatial correlations of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld. The
locality of Λ may also explain the success of the Gaus-
sian approximation for the stream function ψ(x, y). This
Gaussian assumption may prove useful in investigating
other features of 2D turbulence including 2D scalar tur-
bulence.

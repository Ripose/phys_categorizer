Intermittency via Self-Similarity – An Analytic Example

(Dated: January 27, 2014)

Turbulence is known to show intermittency. That is, statistical properties vary with the length
scale in a way not accounted for by statistical similarity where ratios of moments are constant.
Intermittency occurs even in the inertial range of isotropic turbulence, where physical intuition
calls for a self-similar scale dependence. Perceived as a general lack of self-similarity, inertial range
intermittency is known as anomalous scaling. Using an analytic example, we show that anomalous
scaling and self-similarity coexist within the same turbulence statistics. We also describe how the
self-similarity emerges naturally from the random variable that generates the energy spectrum, while
anomalous scaling results from a projection.

PACS numbers: 47.27.Eq, 47.52.+j, 11.80.Cr, 47.27.Gs, 05.45.Jn, 47.27.Jv, 47.27.eb, 47.27.ed

Something is wrong when ideal turbulence is anoma-
lous. Theoretically, turbulence is ideal when all simpli-
fying circumstances are present. First, the ﬂuid is in-
compressible and has constant properties–so the motion
obeys the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Sec-
ond, there are no boundaries and the turbulence is homo-
geneous and isotropic–so there is statistical independence
of location and orientation. Third, steady large scale
forcing puts the turbulence in equilibrium and makes its
properties independent of time. Finally, the Reynolds
number is high so that a wide range of scales separates
forcing at the long lengths from dissipation at the short
lengths. Inertial forces alone govern the physics in this
“inertial range.” Physical intuition dictates that the scale
dependence in the inertial range must be self-similar–in
some way.

Kolmogorov [1] (K41) proposed a similarity like that
in a Brownian motion where ratios of moments are con-
stant. Applied to the diﬀerence δv(ℓ) in a velocity com-
ponent over a distance ℓ, this so-called statistical simi-
p/2
to be independent ℓ. Sta-
larity requires
tistical similarity, however, does not agree with the evi-
dence [2]. The moment ratios are not constant. Equiva-
lently, the probability density functions (pdf’s) for δv(ℓ)
at various ℓ do not collapse to one when plotted in units
of standard deviations. Instead, one observes intermit-
tency: ﬂuctuations of many standard deviations become
increasingly more likely at smaller ℓ. Correspondingly,
the tails of the pdf ﬂare out and become thicker. Al-
ℓζp,
though the moments are power laws, e.g.,
the exponent ζp varies non-linearly with the order p. In
contrast, statistical similarity requires that ζp be linear.
The name “anomalous scaling” alludes to the histori-
cal frustrations in understanding why statistical similar-
ity fails. Frisch [2] presents an account of the history
and theories for intermittency. A recent model consis-
tent with Navier-Stokes equations is proposed by Lund-
gren [3]. Kolmogorov [4] addressed the issue with his
log-normal model (K62). Although K62 has since then
fallen out favor, it remains among the best-known inter-

δvp

i ∝

h

mittency models. To a large extent, it accounts for the
discrepancies between the K41 predictions and experi-
mental observations; see [5, p. 258].

In this letter, we show how self-similarity and anoma-
lous scaling can both exist within the same statistics.
The variables and functions one chooses to work with de-
termine whether one will observe self-similarity or only
anomalous scaling. In particular, self-similarity emerges
from considering the energy at scale ℓ. To avoid lengthy
mathematical derivations, we illustrate these ideas by an
example. The example comes from a similarity theory
we have developed for the inertial range [6]. This theory
employs two assumptions [7] to put the inertial range
pdf for Navier-Stokes turbulence within the small class
of functions generated by the inverse Mellin transform
of z−1 exp
. One of these functions has
K62 scaling exponents. It is our example for three rea-
(cid:1)
sons. First, the calculations work analytically and in
closed form independent of the theory [6]. Second, K62
is widely known and is in reasonable agreement with ob-
servations. Third, the concepts we wish to emphasize
are shared by all functions in the class: self-similarity
emerges through the energy at scale ℓ and exists together
with intermittency within the same statistics.

Our example uses Mellin transforms extensively. This
paragraph reviews the needed properties. The Mellin
transform is deﬁned as follows:

Φ(z) = M [φ(x); z]

xz−1φ(x) dx.

∞

≡ Z

By deﬁnition, the transform is useful for dealing with
moments on the positive real axis. If known, Φ(z) pro-
vides all moments–integer as well as fractional orders.
The transform also comes into play on the full axis:

1)p M [φ(

x); p + 1]

However, full range moments are deﬁned only for inte-
ger orders. Consequently, we face “Hausdorﬀ’s moment
problem,” where the integer moments do not uniquely

identify a function; see [9, p.21]. For example, many func-
tions have the same integer moments as the log-normal.
In contrast, the inverse Mellin transform is unique. The
Mellin transform is closely related to the Fourier trans-
form; see [10, p.41]. Each operational rule for the Fourier
transform has a counterpart in the Mellin transform. We
need the rule [11]:

We start by designing a function F (r, ℓ) that scales
anomalously in r, but normally in ln r. Anomalous scal-
ing requires the p’th moment of F (r, ℓ) to be a power law
Cpℓξp, where ξp depends non-linearly on p. Normal scal-
ing in ρ = ln r means that F (r, ℓ) = f ((ρ(r)
µ(ℓ))/σ(ℓ)).
That is, the scale dependence originates from changing
axis. Let
the origin µ(ℓ) and the unit σ(ℓ) on the ρ
f (ρ) = 1
. By construction, we have normal

The scaling in r is anomalous except when γ = 0.

Now we establish the connection with turbulence. Be-
cause of incompressibility, the velocity is divergence-free
and consequently has only two independent components.
Thus, two random variables describe isotropic turbu-
lence at each scale. There are several ways of choos-
ing them. One choice is longitudinal and transverse
velocity increments, i.e., δvk (ℓ) and δv⊥ (ℓ). Another
is left- and right-handed velocity components obtained
via the complex helical waves decomposition [12]. The-
oretically, we want the variables so that their squares
summed with equal weight yields the energy in scale ℓ

. Essentially, the decay of

(x, ℓ) is log-normal.
In ‘practice,’ the energy shows the way to normal
scaling. Consider a hypothetical dataset with
(x, y, ℓ)
statistics. The objective is to ﬁnd P (r, ℓ) from the data.
We can accomplish that without knowing X and Y . Re-
call that X 2 + Y 2 is the energy at scale ℓ. Assuming
ergodicity, wave-number shell k =
provides an en-
semble of energies at scale ℓ = 2π/k. Besides sum-
ming these energies to get the energy spectrum E(k),
we can also construct the pdf
≡
r < √X 2 + Y 2 < r + dr
. A simple and robust tech-
Pr
nique for that purpose is kernel density estimation; see
(cid:9)
Silverman [14] for details. When dealing with energies
one commonly uses log-log scales, so we have Figure 4a.
Interestingly, we have an asymptote with the character-
istic slope one, independent of the value of ℓ. It is es-
sential to recognize this asymptote as the signature of
a monopole in polar coordinates. That is, P (0, ℓ) > 0
0+. We make
implies
the asymptote horizontal and invariant under abscissa
scaling by considering the function
(r, ℓ)/r, but that is
precisely 2πP (r, ℓ). So we arrive at normal scaling using
only the energy at scale ℓ. Moreover, the energy implies
an azimuthal expansion (8) but does not specify the cor-
responding Cartesian variables X and Y . Our theory [6]

havior in a shell model of isotropic turbulence.
Having gathered the data to construct

(r, ℓ), it is
not much extra work to also compute the moments (i.e.,
structure functions) Sp(ℓ)
previous formulae, we have

When plotted as in Figure 4c, all lines converge on a
focal point.
It is at (0, 0) because of the way we have
normalized our example. The focus marks an infrared
virtual origin for the inertial range. The focal abscissa is
the intrinsic length scale for inertial range. The ordinate
is proportional to the dissipation as in Kolmogorov’s four-
ﬁfths law, but we do not yet know the proportionality
constant.

Our message is the juxtaposition of Figures 2 and 3.
Both ﬁgures represent the same statistics,
(x, y, ℓ), yet
in Figure 2 all curves collapse to one by normal scaling,
while in Figure 3 anomalous scaling prevents them from
doing so. Our example is analytic and exact–no modeling
or numerical issues blur the juxtaposition. Our example
shows directly that intermittency is not at odds with self-
similarity. Normal scaling on the logarithmic axis accom-
modates two independent parameters µ (ℓ) and σ (ℓ); see
Figure 2(b)-(c). In contrast, statistical similarity allows
only one and fails for that reason.

mal scaling as in Figure 2.

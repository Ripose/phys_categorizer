A shallow, vertically shaken granular bed in a quasi 2-D container is studied experimentally
yielding a wider variety of phenomena than in any previous study: (1) bouncing bed, (2) undulations,
(3) granular Leidenfrost eﬀect, (4) convection rolls, and (5) granular gas. These phenomena and the
transitions between them are characterized by dimensionless control parameters and combined in a
full experimental phase diagram.

INTRODUCTION

Vertically shaken granular matter exhibits a wealth of
ﬂuid-like phenomena such as undulations [1, 2, 3], wave
patterns [4, 5], granular Leidenfrost eﬀect [6] and convec-
tion rolls [7]. However, while in normal ﬂuids and gases
these phenomena are fully understood, this is much less
the case for their granular counterparts. In order to get a
better understanding of the underlying physics, here we
present an experimental overview of the various eﬀects
observed in a vibrated bed of glass beads, identifying the
dimensionless control parameters that govern them. The
main goal of the paper is to construct an experimental
phase diagram in which all the observed phenomena are
combined.

Our experimental setup (Fig. 1) consists of a quasi
2-D perspex container of dimensions L × D × H =
101 × 5 × 150 mm (with L the container length, D the
depth, and H the height), partially ﬁlled with glass beads
of diameter d = 1.0 mm, density ρ = 2600 kg/m3, and
coeﬃcient of normal restitution e ≈ 0.95. The setup
is mounted on a sinusoidally vibrating shaker with tun-
able frequency f and amplitude a. Most of the experi-
ments presented in this paper are performed by upsweep-
experiments in which the frequency is linearly increased
at 75 Hz/min. These experiments are recorded with a
high-speed camera capturing 2000 frames per run; ade-
quate recording times (4 to 16 seconds) are obtained by
adjusting the frame rate.

The natural dimensionless control parameters to an-
alyze the experiments are (i) the shaking parameter,
or Froude number, a2ω2/gℓ (with ω = 2πf and g =
9.81 m/s2), being the ratio of the kinetic energy inserted
into the system by the vibrating bottom and the poten-
tial energy associated with a typical displacement of the
particles ℓ, (ii) the number of bead layers F , (iii) the in-
elasticity parameter ε = (1−e2), and (iv) the aspect ratio
L/h0, where h0 denotes the bed height at rest. The pa-
rameter ε is taken to be constant in this paper, since we
ignore the velocity dependence and use the same beads
throughout. The aspect ratio varies by changing the bed
height h0 (i.e., the number of layers F ) but remains large
in all experiments, L/h0 ≫ 1. We will systematically
vary the ﬁrst two dimensionless parameters, by chang-

ameter d = 1.0 mm are vibroﬂuidized. The length of the
container is L = 101 mm; the bed height at rest (h0) is varied
in our experiments such that the aspect ratio L/h0 always
remains large. The container depth is only ﬁve particle diam-
eters, making the setup quasi two-dimensional.

ing the amplitude a, the frequency f , and the number of
layers F .

The most intriguing of the four parameters above is
the ﬁrst one, the shaking parameter, since the typical
displacement of the particles ℓ is inﬂuenced in a non-
trivial way by the vibration intensity and the number of
particle layers. For mild ﬂuidization the displacement of
the particles is determined by the amplitude of shaking
a, since the bed closely follows the motion of the bottom.
The energy ratio in this case becomes identical to the well
known dimensionless shaking acceleration:

For strong ﬂuidization the particles no longer follow the
bottom, so (instead of a) some intrinsic length scale needs
to be taken for ℓ, such as the particle diameter d. This
leads to the dimensionless shaking strength S [6]:

Γ =

aω2
g

S =

a2ω2

At intermediate ﬂuidization, we will encounter phenom-
ena in which there is a competition of length scales. In
this region the transitions are aﬀected by changing one of
the competing length scales, meaning that the choice of

the appropriate shaking parameter is not a priori clear.
This will become an issue in particular for the transi-
tion from undulations to the granular Leidenfrost eﬀect
described in Section IV.

In the following Sections, the various phenomena ob-
served in our system are discussed one by one, in the or-
der in which they appear as the ﬂuidization is increased:
bouncing bed (Section II), undulations (III), granular
Leidenfrost eﬀect (IV), convection rolls (V), and gran-
ular gas (VI). Finally, in Section VII all ﬁve phenomena
will be combined in a phase diagram of the relevant shak-
ing parameter versus the number of layers.

II. BOUNCING BED

For shaking accelerations Γ ≤ 1 (and even for Γ slightly
above 1) the granular bed behaves as a solid, co-moving
with the vibrating bottom and never detaching from it.
In order to detach, the bottom must at some point during
the cycle have a downward acceleration that overcomes
gravity (as for a single bouncing ball [8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16]) plus the friction between the bed and the
walls of the container. These walls carry a considerable
portion of the bed weight, as described by the Rayleigh-
Jansen model [17]. Once the detachment condition is
fulﬁlled, the bed bounces in a similar way as a single
particle would do: We call this a bouncing bed, see Fig. 2.
The value of Γ at which the transition from solid to
bouncing bed occurs has been determined by gradually
increasing the frequency f (for three ﬁxed shaking ampli-
tudes a = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mm). The onset value grows

bottom is indicated in each snapshot, where T is the period
of shaking (ybottom(t) = a sin(2πt/T )). The friction between
the particles and the container walls causes the downward
curvature of the bed close to the sidewalls that is visible in
the lower snapshot.

FIG. 3: (color online). The transition from solid behavior to
bouncing bed is governed by the shaking parameter Γ. The
critical value (here determined for three ﬁxed amplitudes a =
2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mm) increases roughly linearly with the number
of particle layers F .

reason for this is the larger contact area with the front-
and sidewalls causing a proportionally higher frictional

roughly linearly with the number of layers.

Figure 3 indicates that for the current transition
(which occurs at mild ﬂuidization) Γ is a good dimen-
sionless parameter, as explained in the Introduction. It
is not ideal, as exempliﬁed by the fact that the onset val-
ues do not exactly coincide for the diﬀerent amplitudes
of shaking, but for a diﬀerent choice of the shaking pa-
rameter (S) the onset values diﬀer much more.

III. UNDULATIONS

Starting from a bouncing bed and increasing the shak-
ing frequency f , three diﬀerent phenomena are observed:
(a) For F 6 3 layers the bed is vaporized and becomes a
granular gas (Section VI), (b) for 3 < F 6 6 convection
rolls form (Section V), and (c) for F > 6 layers the bed
develops undulations (also called ”arching” or ”ripples”
in the literature [1, 2, 3, 5, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]), which we will cover in this
section.

In the undulations regime, the granular bed shows
standing wave patterns similar to a vibrating string as
shown in Fig. 4. The standing waves oscillate at twice the
period of shaking, and are therefore also known as f /2-
waves [4, 5]. The container (length L) accommodates
an integer number n of half wavelengths of the granular
string:

L = n

n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

undulations in the (Γ, F )-plane, for three ﬁxed values of the
shaking amplitude (a = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mm). The critical value
of the shaking acceleration Γ decreases with growing number
of particle layers F , since the horizontal dilation of the bottom
layer (required to trigger undulations, see text) becomes more
pronounced as a result of the extra layers on top.

period of shaking.

and a = 2.0 mm, at shaking frequencies f = 29.0, 32.6, 38.2,

wavelengths ﬁtting the container length L) increases with the
shaking intensity.

FIG. 7: (color online). The onset of the successive undulation
modes n = 1, 2, .., 6 at a ﬁxed shaking amplitude a = 2.0 mm.
The mode number n increases with the shaking parameter
Γ, but occasionally the undulations give way to the granu-
lar Leidenfrost eﬀect (the hatched regions above the dashed
curve), where a dense cluster without any arches is ﬂoating
on a uniformly dilute granular layer.

besides the shaking amplitude a and the particle diame-
ter d. Unlike these previous length scales, λ is connected
to the elastic properties of the particles, which play an
important role in the undulations.

Generally the ﬁrst undulation to be formed is the n = 1
mode, and for increasing ﬂuidization the higher modes
depicted in Fig. 5 successively appear. They are triggered
by the horizontal dilatancy the bed experiences when it
collides with the vibrating bottom [3]: the string of par-
ticles along the bottom dilates and is forced to form an
arch. Using this physical picture, Sano [3] was able to
derive a theoretical form of the undulation modes, which
qualitatively agrees with the form of the experimental

ones in Fig. 5. We observe that each collision with the
bottom causes a shock wave through the bed at a roughly
constant speed of v = λf = 2 m/s. This sends com-
paction waves along the arch, starting out from the lower
parts and meeting in the center. At this point the waves
bring each other to a halt and the center falls down to
the bottom. (At the same time, the previous lower parts
are now elevated.) This occurs after one shaking period
and the collision with the bottom generates new shock
waves, repeating the series of events. It takes precisely
two periods of shaking to complete one full oscillation of
the undulation pattern.

First we focus on the transition from the bouncing bed
behavior to the undulations, i.e., on the appearance of

the n = 1 mode.
In Fig. 6 this transition is shown in
the (Γ, F )-phase diagram for three ﬁxed amplitudes of
shaking, a = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mm. We observe that the
onset value of Γ decreases with growing number of layers
F . The reason for this is that the necessary horizontal
dilation (of the lower layer) upon impact with the bottom
is more readily accomplished due to pressure from the
extra layers on top.

It is seen in Fig. 6 that the data for the three dif-
ferent shaking amplitudes coincide reasonably, except at
the threshold value of F = 6 layers. Presumably, at this
small value of F the dilation can only become suﬃcient
if the density is locally enhanced by a statistical ﬂuc-
tuation; when the experiment would be repeated many
times the agreement between the averaged data for vari-
ous a is expected to become better. For F < 6 layers no
undulations are found, since the particle density is then
deﬁnitely too small (even in the presence of ﬂuctuations)
to reach the required level of dilation.

Now we come to the higher undulation modes. Fig-
ure 7 displays the observed modes for shaking ampli-
tude a = 2.0 mm. As already observed in Fig. 5 the
mode number n increases for growing Γ. However, the
sequence of modes is seen to be interrupted somewhere
in the middle: Here the undulation pattern gives way to
the granular Leidenfrost state [6], in which a cluster of
slow particles is ﬂoating on top of a dilute layer of fast
particles. Normally, this state appears at the end of the
undulation regime (see Section IV), but when a certain
standing wave pattern is energetically unfavorable the
system chooses the Leidenfrost state instead. In Fig. 7
we see that this happens to the n = 3 undulation, which
is completely skipped from the sequence for F & 12 lay-
ers. This can be understood from the fact that the n = 3
mode has an antinode at the sidewall (i.e., a highly mo-
bile region), whereas the friction with the wall tends to
slow down the particles here. This inherent frustration
gives rise to the appearance of the granular Leidenfrost
eﬀect.

Likewise, the small Leidenfrost region for 9 ≤ F . 12
below the onset line of the n = 5 undulation may well
be the result of a frustrated n = 5 mode here. The
frustration is however not strong enough to skip the mode
as in the n = 3 case. In our experiments, we ﬁnd that
the intermediate regions of the Leidenfrost state become
smaller for larger shaking amplitude a. For a = 4.0 mm
they have disappeared altogether from the undulation
regime, as we will show in Section VII.

IV. GRANULAR LEIDENFROST EFFECT

When the shaking frequency is increased beyond a crit-
ical level, the highest undulation mode becomes unstable
and we enter the granular Leidenfrost regime [6]: Here a
dense cloud of particles is elevated and supported by a
dilute gaseous layer of fast beads underneath, see Fig. 8.
The bottom layer of the undulations is completely evap-

supported by a dilute layer of fast particles underneath. The
cluster never touches the vibrating bottom, which makes this
state distinctively diﬀerent from the bouncing bed or the un-
dulations.

FIG. 9: (color online). The transition from undulations to
the granular Leidenfrost eﬀect for increasing frequency f and
ﬁxed amplitude a = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mm: (a) In the (Γ, F )-plane,
(b) in the (S, F )-plane. Since in our experiments the Leiden-
frost state always originates from the undulation regime, the
same minimum number of layers is needed: F > 6. The crit-
ical values of Γ and S increase with F , since a higher energy
input is required to elevate a larger cluster.

orated and forms the gaseous region on which the cluster
ﬂoats. The phenomenon is analogous to the original Lei-
denfrost eﬀect in which a water droplet hovers over a hot
plate on its own vapor layer, when the temperature of the
plate exceeds a critical value [34]. The vaporized lower
part of the drop provides a cushion to hover on, and
strongly diminishes the heat contact between the plate
and the drop, enabling it to survive for a relatively long
time.

In Fig. 9 the transition from the undulations to the
granular Leidenfrost state is shown, both in the (Γ, F )
and in the (S, F )-plane. Despite the fact that we have
left the mild ﬂuidization regime behind, Γ still appears to
be the governing shaking parameter, since the data for
the diﬀerent amplitudes (a = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mm) collapse
better on a single curve in the (Γ, F ) than in the (S, F )-
plane. In fact, the critical S-values in the latter plane
show a systematic increase for growing amplitude a.

This is in contrast to the observations on the granu-
lar Leidenfrost eﬀect in a previous study of smaller as-
pect ratio [6, 35], for d = 4.0 mm glass beads in a 2-D
container, where the phase transition was shown to be
governed by the dimensionless shaking strength S.
In
that case the Leidenfrost state was reached directly from
the solid, bouncing bed regime, without the intermedi-
ate stage of undulations. Presumably this was due to the
much smaller aspect ratio L/h0, which was in the order
of 1 (against L/h0 ∼ 10 in the present Leidenfrost exper-
iments) [36]. Another important diﬀerence was that the
depth of the setup was just slightly more than one parti-
cle diameter (against 5 diameters in the present setup),
so the motion of the granular bed was much more re-
stricted; indeed, the ﬂoating cluster in Ref. [6] showed a
distinctly crystalline packing. It may be concluded, as
already remarked in the Introduction, that the Leiden-
frost eﬀect lies in the regime of intermediate ﬂuidization,
where both Γ and S are candidates to describe the be-
havior of the granular bed. The proper choice of the
shaking parameter here depends not only on the degree
of ﬂuidization, but also on the dimensions of the speciﬁc
system investigated.

V. CONVECTION ROLLS

In our experiments, granular convection rolls are
formed at high ﬂuidization from either (a) the bounc-
ing bed (for 3 < F 6 6 layers) or (b) the granular Lei-
denfrost eﬀect (for F > 6). In both cases the onset of
convection is caused by a set of particles in the cluster
that are more mobile (higher granular temperature) than
the surrounding area, creating an opening in the bed.
These particles have picked up an excess of energy from
the vibrating bottom (due to a statistical ﬂuctuation)
and collectively move upwards, very much like the onset
of Rayleigh-B´enard convection in a classical ﬂuid heated
from below [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. This upward mo-
tion of the highly mobile beads must be balanced by a

FIG. 10: Granular convection for F = 8.1 layers at f =
73.0 Hz and a = 3.0 mm (dimensionless shaking strength
S = 193), showing four counter-rotating rolls. The beads
move up in the dilute regions (high granular temperature) and
are sprayed sideways to the three dense clusters (low granular
temperature). In our system two clusters are always located
near the sidewalls, which have a relatively low granular tem-
perature due to the extra dissipation. [Enhanced online: link
to movie of granular convection.]

downward movement of neighboring particles, leading to
the formation of a convection roll.

The downward motion is most easily accomplished at
the sidewalls, due to the extra source of dissipation (i.e.,
the friction with the walls), and for this reason the ﬁrst
convection roll is always initiated near one of the two
sidewalls. Within a second, this ﬁrst roll triggers the for-
mation of rolls throughout the entire length of the con-
tainer, leading to a fully developed convection pattern as
in Fig. 10.

Granular convection has been studied extensively at
mild ﬂuidization [23, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53,
54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69],
for which the convection is principally boundary-driven.
However, the buoyancy-driven convection observed here
occurs at high ﬂuidization and this has been reported
much more rarely in the literature. We are aware of
only one numerical study by Paolotti et al. [7] and here
present the ﬁrst experimental observations. In the nu-
merical model by Paolotti et al. the container walls were
taken to be perfectly elastic, leading to convection pat-
terns in which the rolls were either moving up or down
along the sidewalls, whereas in our system (with dissipa-

amplitude a = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mm. Just as for the Leidenfrost
transition, the convection sets in at higher values of S as the
number of layers F is increased, because a higher dissipation
must be overcome for larger bed heights.

stainless steel beads at three consecutive shaking strengths:
S = 58 (a = 2.0 mm, f = 60.0 Hz), S = 130 (a = 3.0 mm,
f = 60.0 Hz), and S = 202 (a = 4.0 mm, f = 56.0 Hz).
For increasing S the convection rolls expand, hence a smaller
number of them ﬁts into the container. The steel beads be-
have qualitatively (but not quantitatively) the same as the
glass beads used in the rest of the paper.

tive walls) they always move down.

Figure 11 shows the transition to convection in the
(S, F )-plane, starting from either the bouncing bed or
the Leidenfrost state, which are taken together because
the transition dynamics is the same in both cases. This
is the ﬁrst instance that the data points (acquired for all
shaking amplitudes a = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mm) collapse
better for the shaking parameter S than for the dimen-
sionless acceleration Γ, meaning that S is the preferred
control parameter for the convection transition.

The onset values of S grow with the number of layers
F , because for large F more energy input from the vi-
brating bottom is necessary to break through the larger
dissipation in the granular bed and trigger the ﬁrst con-
vection roll. Related to this, the number of rolls in the
convection pattern decreases for growing F : Due to the
larger total dissipation, the dense clusters of each roll
grow in size. Hence the convection rolls become wider,
meaning that less rolls ﬁt into the container.

When, for a given number of layers F , the shaking
strength S is increased (either via the frequency f or the
amplitude a), the number of rolls in the convection pat-

a = 3.0 mm (Γ = 30), which has originated from a bounc-
ing bed by increasing the shaking beyond a critical level (see
Fig. 14b). With the vibration power available in our system,
granular gases are only observed for F 6 3 layers. [Enhanced

tern becomes smaller. This is illustrated in Fig. 12: The
higher energy input induces expansion of the convection
rolls, and the number of rolls decreases stepwise as S is
increased. The steps involve two rolls at a time, since the
pattern always contains an even number of rolls due to
the downward motion imposed by the sidewalls.

VI. GRANULAR GAS

In this section we brieﬂy discuss the ﬁfth and last phe-
nomenon observed in our system: A granular gas, being
a dilute cloud of particles moving randomly throughout
the container as in Fig. 13 [70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77,
78, 79]. This state is only observed for a small number of
layers (F 6 3) and always originates from the bouncing
bed regime. At these small F , the bed shows expansion
and compaction during every vibration cycle due to the
low total dissipation. At the critical value of the shak-
ing parameter, the bed expands to such an extent that it
evaporates and forms a gas.

The evaporation of the bouncing bed requires more
energy as the number of layers F increases. The transi-
tion seems to be controlled by the shaking acceleration Γ
(which also governs the transition from solid to bouncing

bed) rather than the shaking strength S. However, the
data points available are too few (F 6 3) to make this
conclusive. The measurements will be presented in the
full phase diagram of the next section.

VII. PHASE DIAGRAM

Finally, all the phenomena and associated transitions
described in the previous sections are combined in the
phase diagram of Fig. 14. Both shaking parameters (Γ
and S) are used in this diagram, each of them indicating
the respective transitions they were found to govern. The
parameter Γ is shown along the left vertical axis and
the corresponding data points (the critical Γ values) are
colored red. The parameter S is plotted along the right
vertical axis and the corresponding experimental data
are colored blue; this concerns only the +-signs at the
convection transition [80]. For comparison the Γ-axis is
kept the same in all three phase diagrams.

Figure 14 contains three separate phase diagrams for
the three ﬁxed shaking amplitudes we have used through-
out the paper: a = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mm. Most of the
phase transitions are hardly aﬀected, with the exception
of the various transitions between the undulations and
the Leidenfrost state. These transitions lie in the regime
of intermediate ﬂuidization, where the system experi-
ences a competition of length scales: the amplitude a,
the particle diameter d, and additionally the wavelength
of the undulations λ. This becomes especially clear in
the phase diagram of Fig. 14(a) for a = 2.0 mm where
the competition results in an alternation of states. By in-
creasing a in Fig. 14(b,c) it becomes the dominant length
scale and the alternation vanishes ultimately.

How does Fig. 14 compare with other phase diagrams

for shaken granular matter in the literature?

First we discuss the experimental phase diagram by
Wassgren et al. [22] for a bed of 1.28 mm glass beads at
mild ﬂuidization (Γ ≤ 10). For increasing Γ, they observe
a series of transitions from a solid bed to undulations
(”arching”) in qualitative agreement with our own exper-
iments at mild shaking. Their series of transitions is in-
terlaced however with several phenomena (Faraday heap-
ing, surface waves) that are not observed in our system.
This is presumably due to the larger depth of their con-
tainer (12.5 particle diameters, versus 5 in our container,
which means that their setup deviates considerably from
2-D) and to the fact that their bed height was typically an
order of magnitude larger than ours: The lowest aspect
ratio L/h0 in their experiments was 2, versus 10 in our
system. Hsiau and Pan [81], who conducted experiments
in a similar setup in the mild ﬂuidization regime, found
the same sequence of phenomena as Wassgren et al. [22].
Indeed, in three dimensions a much wider variety of phe-
nomena is observed than in 2-D systems [4, 5, 55, 82, 83,
84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98].
Secondly, Sunthar and Kumaran [59] construct a phase
diagram (shaking strength vs. number of layers) based on

FIG. 14: (color online). Phase diagram of the shallow gran-
ular bed at three ﬁxed values of the shaking amplitude: (a)
a = 2.0 mm, (b) a = 3.0 mm, and (c) a = 4.0 mm. The
ﬁve phenomena studied in this paper are indicated by the dif-
ferent shadings. The onset values for bouncing bed, undula-
tions, Leidenfrost eﬀect, and gas are governed by the shaking
parameter Γ (left vertical axis, red); the onset of convection
is controlled by S (right vertical axis, blue). The narrow re-
gion without shading along the horizontal F -axis (below the
bouncing bed regime) corresponds to the solid phase, in which
the bed never detaches from the vibrating bottom. [Enhanced

a better understanding of the physics of vertically shaken
granular matter.

event driven simulations in a 2-D system with an aspect
ratio L/h0 & 10, comparable to ours. At low shaking
strength, their phase diagram shows a region where the
bed is ”homogeneous”, corresponding to the solid and
bouncing bed regimes in our diagram. At higher shak-
ing strength, they ﬁnd a granular gas for F < 5 and a
region of granular convection for F > 5. The gaseous
region compares well with the gas region in Fig. 14. The
convection observed by Sunthar and Kumaran, however,
occurs at a much milder ﬂuidization than in our system.
In contrast to our convection rolls, the density of their
rolls is almost constant, indicating that the bed behaves
more like a ﬂuid than a gas.

Thirdly, Eshuis et al. [6] construct an experimental
phase diagram (supported by a theoretical model) for
a bed of 4 mm glass beads in a 2-D setup. The (S, F )-
diagram shows a bouncing solid regime for low shaking
strength and a gas region for small F . Between these two
phases, for S & 16 and F > 8, the Leidenfrost regime is
located. This is qualitatively the same as in Fig. 14,
without the regions of undulations and granular convec-
tion though. The fact that these latter phenomena were
absent is probably due to the much smaller aspect ra-
tio (L/h0 ∼ 1) and the much stronger conﬁnement to
two dimensions, since the depth of the container was just
slightly more than one particle diameter.

Finally, Paolotti et al. [7] performed a 2-D numerical
study of a granular bed with aspect ratio L/h0 ≈ 8,
focusing on the transition towards convection. Their
convection rolls show similar arches and distinct density
diﬀerences as observed in our experiments.
Starting
from strong ﬂuidization, for a given number of layers,
they observe two transitions as the shaking strength is
reduced. First a transition from a non-convective state
(presumably a granular gas) to convection, followed by a
transition towards a non-convective state again, in which
the particles remain localized near the bottom. This
latter state is not further speciﬁed, but most probably
corresponds to a bouncing bed. In the phase diagram of
Fig. 14 the same sequence is found if one follows a path
from the gas regime to the bouncing bed via convection.

In conclusion, we have constructed the experimental
phase diagram for a vertically shaken shallow granular
bed in a quasi 2-D container, identifying the dimension-
less control parameters that govern the various transi-
tions in this diagram. In the present work we have con-
centrated on Γ and S (the shaking parameters), and the
parameter F (number of particle layers). From the dis-
cussion above, it may be concluded that also the aspect
ratio is an important control parameter, determining e.g.
the set of diﬀerent phenomena that a given system is able
to exhibit.

The diagram of Fig. 14 shows the full range of phases
that granular matter can display, behaving either like a
solid, a ﬂuid, or a gas [99, 100, 101, 102, 103]. A determi-
nation of the dimensionless parameters that govern the
transitions between these phases is a crucial step towards

(Received 2 February 2008)

We derive transport equations for the propagation of water wave action in the pres-
ence of a static, spatially random surface drift. Using the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t)
to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at position x contained in waves with
wavevector k, we describe surface wave transport over static ﬂows consisting of two length
scales; one varying smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale com-
parable to the wavelength. The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface ﬂows augment
the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions of the cor-
relations of the random surface currents. These scattering terms depend parametrically
on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying drift and are shown to give
rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism. The Doppler interaction in the presence
of slowly varying drift modiﬁes the scattering processes and provides a mechanism for
coupling long wavelengths with short wavelengths. Conservation of wave action (CWA),
typically derived for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying
ﬂow. At yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an
equation for wave energy diﬀusion. The associated diﬀusion constant is also expressed
in terms of the surface ﬂow correlations. Our results provide a formal set of equations
to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity, energy, and wave scattering as a
function of the slowly varying drifts and the correlation functions of the random, highly
oscillatory surface ﬂows.

1. Introduction

Water wave dynamics are altered by interactions with spatially varying surface ﬂows.
The surface ﬂows modify the free surface boundary conditions that determine the dis-
persion for propagating water waves. The eﬀect of smoothly varying (compared to the
wavelength) currents have been analysed using ray theory (Peregrine (1976), Jonsson
(1990)) and the principle of conservation of wave action (CWA) (cf. Longuet-Higgins
& Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), White (1999), Whitham (1974) and references within).
These studies have largely focussed on long ocean gravity waves propagating over even
larger scale spatially varying drifts. Water waves can also scatter from regions of un-
derlying vorticity regions smaller than the wavelength Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994) and
Cerda & Lund (1993). Boundary conditions that vary on capillary length scales, as well
as wave interactions with structures comparable to or smaller than the wavelength can
also lead to wave scattering (Chou, Lucas & Stone (1995), Gou, Messiter & Schultz
(1993)), attenuation (Chou & Nelson (1994), Lee et al. (1993)), and Bragg reﬂections
(Chou (1998), Naciri & Mei (1988)). Nonetheless, water wave propagation over random

2

Bal & Chou

static underlying currents that vary on both large and small length scales, and their
interactions, have received relatively less attention.

In this paper, we will only consider static irrotational currents, but derive the transport
equations for surface waves in the presence of underlying ﬂows that vary on both long
and short (on the order of the wavelength) length scales. Rather than computing wave
scattering from speciﬁc static ﬂow conﬁgurations (Gerber (1993), Trulson & Mei (1993),
Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994)), we take a statistical approach by considering ensemble
averages over realisations of the static randomness. Diﬀerent statistical approaches have
been applied to wave propagation over a random depth (Elter & Molyneux (1972)), third
sound localization in superﬂuid Helium ﬁlms (Kleinert (1990)), and wave diﬀusion in the
presence of turbulent ﬂows (Howe (1973), Rayevskiy (1983), Fannjiang & Ryzhik (1999)).
In the next section we derive the linearised capillary-gravity wave equations to low-
est order in the irrotational surface ﬂow. The ﬂuid mechanical boundary conditions are
reduced to two partial diﬀerential equations that couple the surface height to velocity
potential at the free surface. We treat only the “high frequency” limit (Ryzhik, Papani-
colaou, & Keller (1996)) where wavelengths are much smaller than wave propagation dis-
tances under consideration. In Section 3, we introduce the Wigner distribution W(x, k, t)
which represents the wave energy density and allows us to treat surface currents that
vary simultaneously on two separated length scales. The dynamical equations developed
in section 2 are then written in terms of an evolution equation for W. Upon expanding
W in powers of wavelength/propagation distance, we obtain transport equations.

In Section 4, we present our main mathematical result, equation (4.1), an equation
describing the transport of surface wave action. Appendix A gives details of some of
the derivation. The transport equation includes advection by the slowly varying drift,
plus scattering terms that are functions of the correlations of the rapidly varying drift,
representing water wave scattering. Upon simultaneously treating both smoothly varying
and rapidly varying ﬂows using a two-scale expansion, we ﬁnd that scattering from rapidly
varying ﬂows depends parametrically on the smoothly varying ﬂows. In the Results and
Discussion, we discuss the regimes of validity, consider speciﬁc forms for the correlation
functions, and detail the conditions for doppler coupling. CWA is extended to include
rapidly varying drift provided that the correlations of the drift satisfy certain constraints.
We also physically motivate the reason for considering two scales for the underlying
drift. In the limit of still larger propagation distances, after multiple wave scattering,
wave propagation leaves the transport regime and becomes diﬀusive (Sheng (1995)). A
diﬀusion equation for water wave energy is also given, with an outline of its derivation
given in Appendix B.

2. Surface wave equations

Assume an underlying ﬂow V(x, z) ≡ (U1(x, z), U2(x, z), Uz(x, z)) ≡ (U(x, z), Uz(x, z)),
where the 1,2 components denote the two-dimensional in-plane directions. This static
ﬂow may be generated by external, time independent sources such as wind or inter-
nal ﬂows beneath the water surface. The surface deformation due to V(x, z) is denoted
¯η(x) where x ≡ (x, y) is the two-dimensional in-plane position vector. An additional
variation in height due to the velocity v(x, z) associated with surface waves is denoted
η(x, t). When all ﬂows are irrotational, we can deﬁne their associated velocity poten-
tials V(x, z) ≡ (∇x + ˆz∂z)Φ(x, z) and v(x, z, t) ≡ (∇x + ˆz∂z)ϕ(x, z, t). Incompressibility
requires

∆ϕ(x, z, t) + ∂2

z ϕ(x, z, t) = ∆Φ(x, z) + ∂2

z Φ(x, z) = 0,

Figure 1. The relevant scales in water wave transport. Initially, the system size, observation
point, and length scale of the slowly varying drift is O(L), with surface wave wavelength and
scale of the random surface current of O(1). Upon rescaling, the system size becomes O(1), while
the wavelength and random ﬂow variations are O(ε).

where ∆ = ∇2
(1974)) applied at z = ¯η(x) + η(x, t) ≡ ζ(x, t) is

x is the two-dimensional Laplacian. The kinematic condition (Whitham

∂tη(x, t) + U(x, ζ) · ∇xζ(x, t) = Uz(x, z = ζ) + ∂zϕ(x, z = ζ, t).

(2.2)

Upon expanding (2.2) to linear order in η and ϕ about the static free surface, the right
hand side becomes

Uz(x, ζ) + ∂zϕ(x, ζ, t) = Uz(x, ¯η) + η(x, t)∂zUz(x, ¯η) + ∂zϕ(x, ¯η, t) + O(η2).

(2.3)
At the static surface ¯η, U(x, ¯η)·∇x ¯η(x) = Uz(x, ¯η). Now assume that the underlying ﬂow
is weak enough such that Uz(x, z ≈ 0) and ¯η are both small. A rigid surface approximation
φ ∼ |∇x ¯η|2 ∼ Uz(x, 0)/|U(x, 0)| ≪ 1 (cφ
is appropriate for small Froude numbers U 2/c2
is the surface wave phase velocity) when the free surface boundary conditions can be
approximately evaluated at z = 0 (Fabrikant & Raevsky (1994)). Although we have
assumed Uz(x, z ≈ 0) = ∂zΦ(x, z ≈ 0) ≈ 0 and a vanishing static surface deformation
¯η(x) ≈ 0, ∇x · U(x, 0) = −∂zUz(x, 0) 6= 0.
Combining the above approximations with the dynamic boundary conditions (derived
from balance of normal surface stresses at z = 0 (Whitham (1974))), we have the pair of
coupled equations

where σ and g are the air-water surface tension and gravitational acceleration, respec-
tively. Although it is straightforward to expand to higher orders in ¯η(x) and η(x, t), or to
include underlying vorticity, we will limit our study to equations (2.4) in order to make
the development of the transport equations more transparent.

The typical system size, or distance of wave propagation shown in Fig. 1 is of O(L) with

Bal & Chou

4
L ≫ 1. Wavelengths however, are of O(1). To implement our high frequency (Ryzhik,
Papanicolaou, & Keller (1996)) asymptotic analyses, we rescale the system such that all
distances are measured in units of L ≡ ε−1. We eventually take the limit ε → 0 as an
approximation for small, ﬁnite ε. Surface velocities, potentials, and height displacements
are now functions of the new variables x → x/ε, z → z/ε and t → t/ε. We shall further
nondimensionalise all distances in terms of the capillary length ℓc = pσ/gρ. Time,
c, and √gℓc
velocity potentials, and velocities are dimensionalised in units of pℓc/g,pgℓ3
respectively, e.g. for water, U = 1 corresponds to a surface drift velocity of ∼ 16.3cm/s.
Since Uz(x, z ≈ 0) ≈ 0, we deﬁne the ﬂow at the surface by
U(x, z = 0) ≡ U(x) + √εδU(x/ε).

(2.5)

In these rescaled coordinates, U(x) denotes surface ﬂows varying on length scales of
O(1) much greater than a typical wavelength, while δU(x/ε) varies over lengths of O(ε)
comparable to a typical wavelength. The amplitude of the slowly varying ﬂow U(x) is
O(ε0), while that of the rapidly varying ﬂow δU(x/ε), is assumed to be of O(√ε). A more
detailed discussion of the physical motivation for considering the √ε scaling is deferred
to the Results and Discussion. After rescaling, the boundary conditions (2.4) evaluated
at z = 0 become

∂tη(x, t) + ∇x ·(cid:2)(cid:0)U(x) + √εδU(x/ε)(cid:1) η(x)(cid:3) = lim
∂tϕ(x, t) + U(x) · ∇xϕ(x, t) + √εδU(x/ε) · ∇xϕ(x, t) = ε∆η(x, t) − ε−1η(x, t).

∂zϕ(x, 0)

z→0−

(2.6)
Although drift that varies slowly along one wavelength can be treated with characteristics
and WKB theory, random ﬂows varying on the wavelength scale require a statistical
approach. Without loss of generality, we choose δU to have zero mean and an isotropic
two-point correlation function hδUi(x)δUj (x′)i ≡ Rij(|x − x′|), where (i, j) = (1, 2) and
h. . .i denotes an ensemble average over realisations of δU(x).

ibility constraint Rx η(x, t) = 0, while the q = 0 mode for ϕ gives an irrelevant constant

shift to the velocity potential. Note that ϕ in (2.7) manifestly satisﬁes (2.1). Substituting

(2.11)

where the δU(q) are correlated according to

hδUi(p)δUj(q)i = Rij (|p|)δ(p + q).

Since the correlation Rij (x) is symmetric in i ↔ j, and depends only upon the magnitude
|x|, Rij(|p − q|) is real.
In the case where δU = 0 and U(x) ≡ U0 is strictly uniform, equations (2.10) can
be simpliﬁed by assuming a e−iωt dependence for all dynamical variables. Uniform drift
yields the familiar capillary-gravity wave dispersion relation

ω(k) = p(k3 + k) tanh kh + U0 · k ≡ Ω(k) + U0 · k.

(2.12)

However, for what follows, we wish to derive transport equations for surface waves (action,
energy, intensity) in the presence of a spatially varying drift containing two length scales:
U = U(x) + √εδU(x/ε).

3. The Wigner distribution and asymptotic analyses

The intensity of the dynamical wave variables can be represented by the product of two
Green functions evaluated at positions x±εy/2. The diﬀerence in their evaluation points,
εy, resolves the waves of wavevector |k| ∼ 2π/(εy). Elter & Molyneux (1972) used this
representation to study shallow water wave propagation over a random bottom. However,
for the arbitrary depth surface wave problem, where the Green function is not simple,
and where two length scales are treated, it is convenient to use the Fourier representation
of the Wigner distribution (Wigner (1932), G´erard et al. (1997), Ryzhik, Papanicolaou,
& Keller (1996)).

Deﬁne ψ = (ψ1, ψ2) ≡ (η(x), ϕ(x, z = 0)) and the Wigner distribution:

The energy above has been expanded to an order in η(x, t) and ϕ(x, z, t) consistent with
the approximations used to derive (2.4). In arriving at the last equality in (3.3), we have
integrated by parts, used the Fourier decompositions (2.7) and imposed an impenetrable
bottom condition at z = −h. The wave energy density carried by wavevector k is (G´erard
et al. (1997))

E(k, t) =

Tr [A(k)W(k, t)] ,

(3.4)

where A11(k) = k2+1, A22(k) = k tanh kh, A12 = A21 = 0. Thus, the Wigner distribution
epitomises the local surface wave energy density.

In the presence of slowly varying drift, we identify W(x, k, t) as the local Wigner
distribution at position x representing waves of wavevector k. The time evolution of its
Fourier transform W(p, k, t), can be derived by considering time evolution of the vector
ﬁeld ψ implied by the boundary conditions (2.4):

functions of the ﬁeld p (dual to x) can be replaced by functions of a slow variation in p
and a fast oscillation ξ/ε; p → p + ξ/ε.
This amounts to the Fourier equivalent of a two-scale expansion in which x is replaced
by x and y = x/ε (Ryzhik, Papanicolaou, & Keller (1996)). The two new independent
wavevectors p and ξ are both of O(1). Expanding the Wigner distribution in powers of

√ε and using p → p + ξ/ε,

W(p, k, t) → W0(p, ξ, k, t) + √εW1/2(p, ξ, k, t) + εW1(p, ξ, k, t) + O(ε3/2),

(3.8)

(3.13)

Right[left] multiplying (3.11) (using (3.13)) by the eigenvectors of the adjoint prob-

lem, cτ (k−)(cid:2)c†
τ (k+)(cid:3), we ﬁnd that a+− = a−+ = 0, and a−−(x, k, t) ≡ a−(x, k, t) =
a++(x,−k, t) ≡ a+(x,−k, t). Furthermore, a+, a− 6= 0 only if ξ = 0. Thus W0 has the
form

(3.14)
From the deﬁnition of W0, we see that the (1,1) component of W0 is the local envelop
of the ensemble averaged wave intensity |η(x, k, t)|2 ≃ a+(x, k, t)α(k). Similarly, from the
energy (Eq. (3.4)), we see immediately that the local ensemble averaged energy density

W0(p, ξ, k, t) = W0(p, k, t)δ(ξ).

hE(x, k, t)i = A11(k)α(k)ha(x, k, t)i + A22(k)ha(x, k, t)i

(3.15)

= Ω(k)ha(x, k, t)i.

Bal & Chou

Therefore, since the starting dynamical equations are linear, we can identify ha(x, k, t)i as
the ensemble averaged local wave action associated with waves of wavevector k (Henyey
et al. (1988)). The wave action ha(x, k, t)i, rather than the energy density hE(x, k, t)i
is the conserved quantity (Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), Whitham
(1974)).

The physical origin of γ arises from causality, but can also be explicitly derived from
considerations of an inﬁnitesimally small viscous dissipation (Chou, Lucas & Stone
(1995)). Although we have assumed γ → 0, for our model to be valid, the viscosity
need only be small enough such that surface waves are not attenuated before they have
a chance to multiply scatter and enter the transport or diﬀusion regimes under consid-
eration. This constraint can be quantiﬁed by noting that in the frequency domain, wave
dissipation is given by γ = 2νk2 (Landau (1985)) where ν is the kinematic viscosity and

is the group velocity. The corresponding decay length k−1
than the relevant wave propagation distance. Therefore, we require

d ∼ cg(k)/(νk2) must be greater

cg(k) ≡ |∇kΩ(k)|

(3.16)

ε2cg(k/ε)

νk2 ≫ (1, ε−1)

(3.17)

for (transport, diﬀusion) theories to be valid. The inequality (3.17) gives an upper bound
for the viscosity

νk2 ≪ (εcg(k/ε), ε2cg(k/ε))

(3.18)

which is most easily satisﬁed in the shallow water wave regime for transport. Otherwise
we must at least require ν < o(√ε). The upper bounds for ν (and hence γ) given above
provide one criterion for the validity of transport theory.

justiﬁed in the scalar case (Spohn (1977), Erd¨os & Yau (1998)).

4. The surface wave transport equation

The main mathematical result of this paper, an evolution equation for the ensemble
averaged wave action a(x, k, t) follows from equation (3.22) above (cf. Appendix A) and
reads,

˙a(x, k, t) + ∇kω(x, k) · ∇xa(x, k, t) − ∇xω(x, k) · ∇ka(x, k, t)

where

= −Σ(k)a(x, k, t) +Zq

σ(q, k)a(x, q, t),

ω(x, k) = p(k3 + k) tanh kh + U(x) · k ≡ Ω(k) + U(x) · k.

The left hand side in (4.1) corresponds to wave action propagation in the absence of
random ﬂuctuations. It is equivalent to the equations obtained by the ray theory, or
a WKB expansion (see section 5.1). The two terms on the right hand side of (4.1)
represent refraction, or “scattering” of wave action out of and into waves with wavevector

k respectively. In deriving (4.1) we have inverse Fourier transformed back to the slow ﬁeld
point variable x, and used the relation (α(k)− f (k)α−1(k))k ≡ ∇kΩ(k). To obtain (4.1),
we assumed Rij (q)qi = Rij(q)qj = 0, which would always be valid for divergence-free
ﬂows in two dimensions. Although the perturbation δU is not divergence-free in general,
∇·δU(x, z = 0) = −∂zδUz(x, 0) 6= 0, using symmetry considerations, we will show in
section 5.2 that Rij (q)qi = Rij(q)qj = 0.

Explicitly, the scattering rates are

(4.4)

Physically, Σ(k) is a decay rate arising from scattering of action out of wavevector k.
The kernel σ(q, k) represents scattering of action from wavevector q into action with
wavevector k. Note that the slowly varying drift U(x) enters parametrically in the scat-
tering via ω(x, k) in the δ−function supports. The arguments ω(x, k) in the δ−functions
mean that we can consider the transport of waves of each ﬁxed frequency ω0 ≡ ω(x, k)
independently.
The typical distance travelled by a wave before it is signiﬁcantly redirected is deﬁned

by the mean free path

ℓmfp =

cg(k)
Σ(k) ∼ O(1).

(4.5)

The mean free path described here carries a diﬀerent interpretation from that considered
in weakly nonlinear, or multiple scattering theories (Zakharov, L’vov & Falkovich (1992))
where one treats a low density of scatterers. Rather than strong, rare scatterings over
every distance ℓmfp ∼ O(1), we have considered constant, but weak interaction with
an extended, random ﬂow ﬁeld. Although here, each scattering is O(ε) and weak, over
a distance of O(1), approximately ε−1 interactions arise, ultimately producing ℓmfp ∼
O(1).

5. Results and Discussion

We have derived transport equations for water wave propagation interacting with
static, random surface ﬂows containing two explicit length scales. We have further as-
sumed that the amplitude of δU scales as εβ with β = 1/2: The random ﬂows are
correspondingly weakened as the high frequency limit is taken. Since scattering strength
is proportional to the power spectrum of the random ﬂows and is quadratic in δU, the
mean free path can be estimated heuristically by ℓmfp ∼ cg(k)/Σ(k)ε1−2β. For β > 1/2,
the scattering is too weak and the mean free path diverges. In this limit, waves are nearly
freely propagating and can be described by the slowly varying ﬂows alone, or WKB the-
ory. If β < 1/2, ℓmfp → 0 and the scattering becomes so frequent that over a propagation
distance of O(1), the large number of scatterings lead to diﬀusive (cf. Section 5.4) be-

Water wave transport

11

haviour (Sheng (1995)). Therefore, only random ﬂows that have the scaling β = 1/2
contribute to the wave transport regime.

We also note that β > 0 precludes any wave localisation phenomena. In a two-
dimensional random environment, the localisation length over which wave diﬀusion is
inhibited is approximately (Sheng (1995))

ℓloc ∼ ℓmfp exp(cid:16)ε−1kℓmfp(cid:17) ∼ ε1−2β exp(cid:0)ε−2β(cid:1) .

(5.1)

As long as the random potential is scaled weaker (β > 0), ℓloc → ∞, and strong lo-
calisation will not take hold. In the following subsections, we systematically discuss the
salient features of water wave transport contained in Eq. (4.1) and derive wave diﬀusion
for propagation distances & O(1).

5.1. Slowly varying drift: U(x) 6= 0, δU = 0

First consider the case where surface ﬂows vary only on scales much larger than the
longest wavelength 2π/k considered, i.e., δU = 0. The left-hand side in (4.1) represents
wave action transport over slowly varying drift and may describe short wavelength modes
propagating over ﬂows generated by underlying long ocean waves.

We ﬁrst demonstrate that the nonscattering terms of the transport equation (4.1) is
equivalent to the results obtained by ray theory (WKB expansion) and conservation of
wave action (CWA) (Longuet-Higgins & Stewart (1961), Mei (1979), Peregrine (1976),
White (1999), Whitham (1974)). Assume the WKB expansion (Keller (1958), Bender &
Orszag (1978))

ηε = Aη(x, t)eiS(x,t)/ε

and

ϕε = Aϕ(x, t)eiS(x,t)/ε,

(5.2)

with smoothly varying Aη and Aϕ. Upon using the above ansatz in (3.1) and setting
ε → 0, we have a(x, k, t) = |A|2(x, t)δ(k − ∇xS(x, t)) where |A|2 = 2α(k)|Aϕ|2 =
2α−1(k)|Aη|2. Substitution of this expression for a(x, k, t) into (4.1), we obtain the fol-
lowing possible equations for S(x, t) and |A|2(x, t)

∂tS + ω(x,∇xS) = 0,
∂t|A|2(x, t) + ∇x ·(cid:16)|A|2∇kω(x,∇xS)(cid:17) = 0.

(5.3)

(5.4)

The ﬁrst equation is the eikonal equation, while the second equation is the wave action
amplitude equation. Recalling that |Aη|2 = α(k)|A|2/2, we obtain the following transport
equation for the height amplitude:

∂t(cid:16) |Aη|2
α(∇xS)(cid:17) + ∇x ·(cid:16) |Aη|2

α(∇xS)∇kω(x,∇xS)(cid:17) = 0.

(5.5)

Equation (5.5) is the same as Eq. (8) of White (1999), except that his ¯Ω is replaced here
with α due to our inclusion of surface tension.

Wave action conservation can be understood by noting that

d
dt

a(X(t), K(t), t) = 0,

(5.6)

where the characteristics (X(t), K(t)) satisfy the Hamilton equations

dX(t)

= ∇kω(X(t), K(t)),

and

dK(t)

= −∇xω(X(t), K(t)).

(5.7)

The solutions to the ordinary diﬀerential equations (5.7) are the characteristic curves
used to solve (5.3) and (5.4) (Courant & Hilbert (1962)).

5.2. Correlation functions and conservation laws

We now consider the case where δU 6= 0. The scattering rates deﬁned by (4.3) depend
upon the precise form of the random ﬂow correlation Rij. There are actually six additional
terms in (4.3) in the calculation of σ and Σ, which vanish because

for i = 1, 2.

(5.8)

We prove relation (5.8) provided that δUz(k, kz) and δUz(k,−kz) have the same proba-
bility distribution. Thus,

hδUi(p, pz)δUz(k, kz)i = hδUi(p, pz)δUz(k,−kz)i

(5.9)

This symmetry condition is reasonable, and is compatible with the divergence-free con-
dition for δU in three dimensions. We show that Hypothesis (5.9) implies (5.8) by ﬁrst

using incompressibility P2

where the last equality follows from (5.9). Thus, (5.8) is veriﬁed, and (4.3) derived.

The form Rij (|q|)qi = Rij (|q|)qj = 0, requires the correlation function to be transverse:
(5.10)

qiqj

Rij(|q|) = R(q)(cid:20)δij −

q2 (cid:21) ,

where R(q) is a scalar function of q. The correlation kernels in the scattering integrals
can now be written as

qiRij (|τ q − k|)kj = R(|τ q − k|)(cid:20)q · k −

q · (τ q − k)k · (τ q − k)

|τ q − k|2

(cid:21)

= τ

R(|τ q − k|)
|τ q − k|2 q2k2 sin2 θ

(5.11)

where θ denotes the angle between q and k. The scattering must also satisfy the support
of the δ-functions; for U(x) = 0 only |q| = |k| satisfy the the δ−function constraints. In
the presence of slowly varying drift, the evolution of a(x,|k| 6= |q|) can “doppler” couple
to a(x, q, t).

It is straightforward to show from the explicit expressions (4.3) that

Σ(k) = Zq

σ(k, q).

(5.12)

This relation indicates that the scattering operator on the right hand side of (4.1) is
conservative: Integrating (4.1) over the whole phase space yields

a(x, k, t) = 0.

k that lie in this band can couple a(x, k, t) to a(x, q, t) via wave scattering.

d

Equation (5.13) is the generalization of CWA to include scattering of action from rapidly
varying random ﬂows δU(x/ε). Although a(x, k, t) is conserved, the total water wave
energy E(x, k, t) = Ω(k)a(x, k, t) will not be conserved. For example, if U (x) is small
enough such that the δ−function in the σ(q, k) integral is triggered only when τ = +1,
d
dtE =
k · U(x) a(x, k, t) 6= 0. (5.14)
This nonconservation results from the energy that must be supplied in order to sustain
the stationary underlying ﬂow. For small U (x), the quantity ω(x, k)a(x, k, t) is conserved.
In that case, the evolution of ω(x, k)a(x, k, t) obeys an equation identical to (4.1). When
there is doppler coupling with τ = −1, an additional term arises and ω(x, k)a(x, k, t) is
no longer conserved under scattering.

5.3. Doppler coupled scattering

In addition to the correlation functions, the wave action scattering terms involving Σ(k)
and integrals over σ(q, k) depend also on the support of the δ−function. Consider action
contained in water waves of ﬁxed wavevector k. When U(x) = 0, only τ = +1 terms
contribute to the the integration over q as long as |q| = |k|. In this case, we can deﬁne
the angle q · k = k2 cos θ and reduce the cross-sections to single angular integrals over
(5.15)

τ = +1.

θ

,

In this case (U(x) = 0), assuming R(|q|) is monotonically decreasing, the most important
contribution to the scattering occurs when q and k are collinear.
When U(x) 6= 0, and τ = +1, the sets of q which satisfy Ω(q) + U(x) · q = Ω(k) +
U(x) · k ≡ ω0 trace out closed ellipse-like curves and are shown in the contour plots
of ω(q) in Figure 2(a). The parameters used are U(x) · k1 = −0.5k1 and h = ∞ (the
−k1,−q1 directions are deﬁned by the direction of U(x)).
Each grayscale corresponds to a curve deﬁned by ﬁxed ω(k) = ω0. All wavevectors q
in each contour contribute to the integration in the expressions for Σ(k) and ω(q, k).
Thus, slowly varying drift can induce an indirect doppler coupling between waves with

qiRij (|q − k|)qj = R(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:12)2k sin

Bal & Chou

diﬀerent wavenumbers, with the most drastic coupling occurring at the two far ends of
a particular oval curve. For example, in Figure 2(b), the dark band denotes q such that
ω(q) = ω0 when 0.625 < ω0 < 0.6625. The wavevectors q ≈ (−0.3, 0) and q ≈ (0.8, 0)
are two of many that contribute to the scattering terms. Therefore, the evolution of
a(x, k ≈ (−0.3, 0), t) also depends on a(x, q ≈ (0.8, 0), t) via the second term on the
right side of (4.1).
Provided U(x) is suﬃciently large, the τ = −1 terms can also contribute to scatter-
ing. The dissipative scattering rate Σ(k)a(x, k, t) will change quantitatively since addi-
tional q’s will contribute to Σ(k). However, this decay process depends only on k and
is not coupled to a(x,|q| 6= |k|, t). Wavevectors q that satisfy the δ−function in the
σ(q, k)a(x, q, t) term will, as when τ = +1, lead to indirect doppler coupling. This oc-
curs when ω(q) = −ω0 and, as we shall see, allows doppler coupling of waves with more
widely varying wavelengths than compared to the τ = +1 case. Observe that if τ = −1
terms arise, the drift frame energy a(x, k, t)ω(x, k) is no longer conserved. Figure 3(a)
plots ω(q1, q2 = 0) for U (x) = 1 < √2, U (x) = √2, and U (x) = 1.6 > √2. Since ω0
and ω(q) are identical functions, −ω0 can take on values below the upper dotted line
(ω0 . 0.22 for U = 1.6). Therefore, coupling for τ = −1 and q2 = 0 occurs for values of
−ω0 between the dotted lines. Note that depending upon the value of ω0, coupling can
occur at two or four diﬀerent points q = (q1, 0). Figure 3(b) shows a contour plot of |ω(q)|
as a function of (q1, q2). A level set lying between the dotted lines in (a) will slice out two
bands; one band corresponds to all values of k that couple to q lying in the associated
second band. The two bands determined by the interval 0.414 < −ω0 < 0.468 are shown
in Fig. 3(c). For any k lying in the inner band of Fig. 3(c), all q lying in the outer band
will contribute to doppler coupling for τ = −1, and vice versa. As −ω0 is increased, the
inner(outer) band decreases(increases) in size, with the central band vanishing when −ω0
approaches the upper dotted line in (a) where the τ = −1 coupling evaporates. If −ω0
is decreased, the two bands merge, then disappear as −ω0 reaches the lower limit. Fig.
3(d) is an expanded view of the two bands for small 0.0756 < −ω0 < 0.1368. Note that
a small island of q or k appears for very small wavevectors. The water wave scattering
represented by σ(q, k) can therefore couple very long wavelength modes with very short
wavelength modes (the two larger bands to the right in Fig. 3(d)). However, the strength
of this coupling is still determined by the magnitude of qiRij (|q − k|)kj , which may be
small for |q − k| large.

The depth dependence of doppler coupling will be relevant when hq, hk . 1 where q
and k are the magnitudes of the wavevectors of two doppler-coupled waves. For τ = +1,
ﬁnite depth reduces the ellipticity of the coupling bands, resulting in weaker doppler
eﬀects. Since the water wave phase velocity decreases with h, a ﬁnite depth will also
reduce the critical U (x) required for τ = −1 doppler coupling. For small U (x), it is clear
that the δ−functions associated with the τ = −1 terms in σ(q, k) are ﬁrst triggered when
the q and k are antiparallel, U · k = −k|U|, U · q = +q|U|.
Figure 4(a) shows the phase velocity for various depths h. In order for τ = −1 to
contribute to scattering, U > cφ(k; h). For U ≈ 1.6, this condition holds in the h = ∞ case
for 0.5 . k . 2 (the dashed region of cφ(k,∞)). Recall that our starting equations (2.4)
are valid only in the small Froude number limit. However, for water waves propagating
over inﬁnite depth, τ = −1 coupling requires U > Umin = mink{cφ(k)}, with cφ(kmin) ≃
22cm/s. Therefore, in such “supersonic” cases, where τ = −1 is relevant, our treatment
is accurate only at wavevectors k∗ such that U ≪ cφ(k∗; h), e.g., the thick solid portion
of cφ(k;∞). For U & Umin, the τ = −1 term can couple wavevectors q ≈ 0 ≪ kmin
with k ≈ 2 − 3 ≫ kmin. The rich τ = −1 doppler coupling displayed in Figures 3 is

particular to water waves with a dispersion relation ω(q) that behaves as q3/2, U · q, or
q1/2 depending on the wavelength. Doppler coupling in water wave propagation is very
diﬀerent from that arising in acoustic wave propagation in an incompressible, randomly
ﬂowing ﬂuid (Howe (1973), Fannjiang & Ryzhik (1999), Vedantham & Hunter (1997))
where ω(q) = cs|q|. An additional doppler coupling analogous to the τ = −1 coupling
for water waves arises only for supersonic random ﬂows when U (x) > cs, independent of
q. In such instances, compressibility eﬀects must also be considered.

Figure 4(b) plots the minimum drift velocity Umin(h) where τ = −1 doppler coupling
ﬁrst occurs at any wavevector. The wavevector at which coupling ﬁrst occurs is also
√h and very long
shown by the dashed curve. For shallow water, h ≪ √3, Umin(h) ∝
wavelengths couple ﬁrst (small k(Umin)). For depths h > √3 (∼ 3cm for water), the
minimum drift required quickly increases to U ∗(∞) = √2, while the initial coupling
occurs at increasing wavevectors until at inﬁnite depth, where the ﬁrst wavevector to
doppler couple approaches k → 1 (in water, this corresponds to wavelengths of ∼ 6.3cm).
The conditions for τ = −1 doppler coupling outlined in Figures 2 and 3 apply to both

corresponding to a constant value of ω(k) = ω0, traces out a noncircular curve. There is
doppler coupling between wavenumbers q 6= k as long as U 6= 0.

5.4. Surface wave diﬀusion

We now consider the radiative transfer equation (4.1) over propagation distances long
compared to the mean free path ℓmfp. Imposing an additional rescaling and measuring all
distances in terms of the mean free path, we introduce another scaling ǫ−1, proportional
to the number of mean free paths travelled. Since β = 1/2, transport of wave action
prevails when O(ε) < |x| ∼ O(1), while diﬀusion holds when O(ǫ−1) ∼ |x| < ℓloc.
Since waves of each frequency satisfy (4.1) independently, we consider the diﬀusion of
waves of constant frequency ω0. To derive the diﬀusion equation, we assume for simplicity
that U is constant and small such that ω0 + ω(x, q) 6= 0 (the τ = −1 terms are never
triggered by the δ−functions). Expanding all quantities in the transport equation (4.1)
in powers of ǫ, we ﬁnd

˙a0 + ¯U · ∇xa0 − ∇x · D · ∇xa0 = 0.

(5.16)

The derivation of this equation is given in Appendix B. The diﬀusion tensor D is given
in (B 12) and is a function of the power spectrum Rij. The eﬀective drift ¯U is given by
(B 7):

¯U = Rk ∇kω(k)δ(k · U + Ω(k) − ω0)

Rk δ(k · U + Ω(k) − ω0)

.

(5.17)

Up to a change of basis, we can assume that U = U e1, where U > 0. Then the set of
points k · U + Ω(k) − ω0 = 0 is symmetric with respect to the x1−axis and ¯U is parallel
to U. Also notice that the total energy given in (3.15) is asymptotically conserved in the

Water wave transport

diﬀusive regime. Indeed, the total energy variations are given by (5.14). Assuming that
all water waves have frequency ω0, we have in the diﬀusive regime

we deduce that

which conserves the total energy E.
Now consider the simpliﬁed case U ≡ 0, h = ∞ and Ω∞(k) = √k3 + k. Since U =

6. Summary and Conclusions

In this paper, we have used the Wigner distribution to derive the transport equations
for water wave propagation over a spatially random drift composed of a slowly varying
part U(x), and a rapidly varying part √εδU(x/ε). The slowly varying part determines
the characteristics on which the waves propagate. We recover the standard result obtained
from WKB theory: conservation of wave action. Provided Rij(q)qj = 0, we extend CWA
to include wave scattering from correlations Rij of the rapidly varying random ﬂow.
Evolution equations for the nonconserved wave intensity and energy density can be read-
ily obtained from (4.1). Moreover, conservation of drift frame energy a(x, k, t)ω(x, k)
requires small U < Umin and absence of τ = −1 contributions to scattering.
Explicit expressions for the scattering rates Σ(k) and σ(q, k) are given in Eqs. (4.3).
For ﬁxed ω(k), we ﬁnd the set of q such that the δ−functions in (4.3) are supported.
This set of q indicates the wavevectors of the background surface ﬂow that can me-
diate doppler coupling of the water waves. Although widely varying wavenumbers can
doppler couple, supported by the δ−function constraints, particularly for τ = −1, the
correlation Rij(|q−k|) also decreases for large |q−k|. For long times, multiple weak scat-
tering nonetheless exchanges action among disparate wavenumbers within the transport

regime. Our collective results, including water wave action diﬀusion, provide a model for
describing linear ocean wave propagation over random ﬂows of diﬀerent length scales.
The scattering terms in (4.1) also provide a means to correlate sea surface wave spectra
to statistics Rij of ﬁner scale random ﬂows.

Although many situations arise where the underlying ﬂow is rotational (White (1999)),
the irrotational approximation used simpliﬁes the treatment and allows a relatively simple
derivation of the transport and diﬀusive regimes of water wave propagation. The recent
extension by White (1999) of CWA to include rotational ﬂows also suggests that an
explicit consideration of velocity and pressure can be used to generalise the present
study to include rotational random ﬂows. Other feasible extensions include the analysis
of a time varying random ﬂow, as well as separating the underlying ﬂows into static and
wave dynamic components.

Appendix A. Derivation of the transport equation

Some of the steps in the derivation of (4.1) are outlined here. By taking the time

terms yields the integral equation (3.7).

0. Due to the nonlocal nature of the third term on the right of (3.19), we must ﬁrst inverse
Fourier transform the slow wavevector variable back to x.

To extract the O(ε0) terms from (3.7) we need to expand L to order ε0, the L1 term.

Similarly, the terms W(p − q, ξ, k ± εq/2) must be expanded:

W(p − q, ξ, k ± εq/2) = W(p − q, ξ, k) ±

q · ∇kW(p − q, ξ, k) + O(ε2).

The εq·∇kW(p− q, ξ, k) terms combine with the −ε−1U(q) · k− + ε−1U(q) · k+ terms
from the third and fourth terms in (3.7) to give the third term on the right of Eq. (3.22).
The δU-dependent, order ε0 terms (the sixth, seventh, and eighth terms on the right side
of (3.22)) come from collecting

from the last two terms in (3.7). The ensemble averaged time evolution of the Wigner
amplitude aσ(x, k) can be succinctly written in the form:

˙a+(x, k, t) − ∇xω(x, k) · ∇ka+(x, k, t) + ∇kω(x, k) · ∇xa+(x, k, t)

= Σ+,µ(k)aµ(x, k, t) +Zq

σ+,µ(q, k)aµ(x, k, t).

(A 6)
Using the form for W0 found from (3.11) in (3.19) to ﬁnd W1/2, we substitute into
(3.22) to ﬁnd (4.1), the transport equation for one of the diagonal intensities of the Wigner
distribution. We have explicitly used eigenbasis orthonormality b†
τ (k)· cτ ′ (k) = δτ,τ ′ and
the fact that a−(x, k, t) = a+(x,−k, t).

Appendix B. Derivation of the diﬀusion equation

The derivation of diﬀusion of water wave action is outlined below and follows the
established mathematical treatment of Larsen & Keller (1974) and Dautray & Lions
(1993). For simplicity we assume that the ﬂow U is constant and small enough so that
for a considered range of frequencies, the relation ω(q) + ω(k) = 0 is never satisﬁed
for any k and q 6= 0. The diﬀusion approximation is valid after long times and large
distances of propagation X(see Fig. 1) such that the wave has multiply scattered and its
dynamics are determined by a random walk. We therefore rescale time and space as

˜t =

t
ǫ2 ,

˜x =

x
ǫ

.

(B 1)

The small parameter ǫ in this further rescaling represents the transport mean free path
ℓmfp and not the wavelength as in the initial rescaling used to derive the transport
equation. We drop the tilde symbol for convenience and rewrite the transport equation
in the new variables:

˙aǫ(x, k, t)+

1
ǫ ∇kω(k)·∇xaǫ(x.k, t) =

1

ǫ2 Zq Q(q, k)(aǫ(x, q, t)−aǫ(x, k, t))δ(ω(q)−ω(k)),

(B 2)
with obvious notation for Q(q, k). Since the frequency is ﬁxed, the equation is posed
for k satisfying ω(k) = ω0. The transport equation assumes the form (B 2) because the
scattering operator is conservative. Since U 6= 0, wave action is transported by the ﬂow,
and diﬀusion takes place on top of advection. Therefore, we introduce the main drift ¯U,

20

Bal & Chou

which will be computed explicitly later, and deﬁne the drift-free unknown ˜aǫ(x, k, t) as

˜aǫ(x, k, t) = aǫ(x +

¯U
ǫ

t, k, t).

(B 3)

It is easy to check that ˜aǫ satisﬁes the same transport equation as aǫ where the drift
term ∇kω has been replaced by ∇kω − ¯U.

We now derive the limit of ˜aǫ as ǫ → 0. Consider the classical asymptotic expansion
(B 4)

˜aǫ = ˜a0 + ǫ˜a1 + ǫ2˜a2 + . . . .

Upon substitution into (B 2) and equating like powers of ǫ, we obtain at order ǫ−2, for
ﬁxed frequency ω0,

Zq Q(q, k)(˜a0(x, q, t) − ˜a0(x, k, t))δ(ω(q) − ω0) = 0.

(B 5)

It follows from the Krein-Rutman theory (Dautray & Lions (1993)) that ˜a0 is independent
of q. At order ǫ−1, we obtain

(∇kω(k) − ¯U) · ∇x˜a0 = Zq Q(q, k)(˜a1(x, q, t) − ˜a1(x, k, t))δ(ω(q) − ω0).

(B 6)

The compatibility condition for this equation to admit a solution requires both sides to
vanish upon integration over δ(ω(k) − ω0)dk. Therefore, ¯U satisﬁes

¯U =

1

Vω0 Zk ∇kω(k)δ(ω(k) − ω0),

where

Vω0 = Zk

δ(ω(k) − ω0).

(B 7)

Once the constraint is satisﬁed, we deduce from Krein-Rutman theory the existence of a
vector-valued mean zero corrector χ solving

(∇kω(k) − ¯U) = Zq Q(q, k)(χ(q) − χ(k))δ(ω(q) − ω0) ≡ Lχ.

(B 8)

There is no general analytic expression for χ, which must in practice be solved numer-
ically. This is typical of problems where the domain of integration in q does not have
enough symmetries (cf. Allaire & Bal (1999), Bal (1999)). We now have

It remains to consider O(ǫ0) in the asymptotic expansion. This yields

˜a1(x, k, t) = χ(k) · ∇x˜a0(x, t).

˙˜a0 + (∇kω(k) − ¯U) · ∇x˜a1 = L(˜a2).

(B 9)

(B 10)

The compatibility condition, obtained by integrating both sides over k, yields the wave
action diﬀusion equation

where the diﬀusion tensor is given by

˙˜a0 − ∇x · D · ∇x˜a0 = 0,

D = −

1

Vω0 Zk

(∇kω(k) − ¯U)χT (k) = −

1

Vω0 Zk L(χ)χT (k).

(B 11)

(B 12)

The second form shows that D is positive deﬁnite since L is a nonpositive operator. The
formal asymptotic expansion can be justiﬁed rigorously using the techniques in Dautray
& Lions (1993). As ǫ → 0, we obtain that the error between ˜aǫ and ˜a0 is at most of
order ǫ. Therefore, we have that aǫ converges to a0 satisfying the following drift-diﬀusion
equation

˙a0 +

¯U
ǫ · ∇xa0 − ∇x · D · ∇xa0 = 0,

(B 13)

with suitable initial conditions. Equation (B 13) is the coordinate-scaled version of (5.16).

Abstract

Superstatistics is a ‘statistics of a statistics’ relevant for driven
nonequilibrium systems with ﬂuctuating intensive parameters. It con-
tains Tsallis statistics as a special case. We show that probability
density functions of velocity diﬀerences and accelerations measured in
Eulerian and Lagrangian turbulence experiments are well reproduced
by simple superstatistics models. We compare ﬁts obtained for log-
normal superstatistics and χ2-superstatistics (= Tsallis statistics).

1 Introduction

There is currently considerable interest in more general versions of statistical
mechanics, known under the name nonextensive statistical mechanics [1, 2, 3].
In the mean time, it has become clear that Tsallis’ original approach [1] can
generalized in various ways, and that these techniques are often relevant for
the eﬀective description of nonequilibrium systems with strong ﬂuctuations
of an intensive parameter, where ordinary statistical mechanics has little
to say [4, 5, 6]. A particular class of more general statistics relevant for
nonequilibrium systems, containing Tsallis statistics as a special case, has
been termed ’superstatistics’ [6, 7, 8]. A superstatistics arises out of the
superposition of two statistics, namely one described by ordinary Boltzmann
factors e−βE and another one given by the probability distribution of β. This
means the inverse temperature parameter β is assumed not to be constant but
to be ﬂuctuating on a relatively large time scale or spatial scale. Naturally,
this kind of approach is physically relevant for driven nonequilibrium systems
with ﬂuctuations, rather than for equilibrium systems.

Depending on the probability distribution of β, there are inﬁnitely many
superstatistics. It has been shown that Tsallis statistics is a particular super-
statistics obtained under the assumption that β is χ2-distributed [5]. Var-
ious other examples of superstatistics have been studied [6], among them
superstatistics of log-normal type. A main result of [6] was that for small
E all superstatistics behave in a universal way, i.e. they generate probabil-
ity distributions close to Tsallis distributions. But for large E the various
superstatistics can have quite diﬀerent properties.

In this paper we work out the application of this very new concept of
statistical mechanics to fully developed turbulence. By comparison with var-
ious data from Eulerian and Lagrangian turbulence experiments, as well as
data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equa-
tion, we will provide evidence that superstatistics of log-normal type quite
well describes measured probability densities in hydrodynamic turbulence.
This superstatistics can be dynamically realized by considering a class of
stochastic diﬀerential equations previously introduced in [5], but now with a
log-normal rather than χ2-distribution of the damping parameter. In general,
if the velocity diﬀerence is not too large, most superstatistics models yield
probability densities that are similar to Tsallis statistics. Signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences only occur for the tails of the distribution, i.e. for very rare events. For
the extreme tails, superstatistics based on log-normal distributions seems to

1

provide better ﬁts than superstatistics based on χ2-distributions (i.e. ordi-
nary Tsallis statistics). On the other hand, if the velocity diﬀerence is not
too large (say less than about 30 standard deviations), then Tsallis statistics
is quite a good approximation, with the advantage that an explicit formula
for the densities can be given. For ‘early’ work emphasizing the relevance of
Tsallis statistics in 3d-turbulence, see e.g. [9, 10, 11].

We will analyse data sets from three diﬀerent experiments/simulations.
The experimental measurements were done by Swinney et al. (Eulerian tur-
bulence) and Bodenschatz et al. (Lagrangian turbulence). The direct nu-
merical simulation (DNS) data were obtained by Gotoh et al. We are very
grateful to all three groups for providing us with their data.

2 Superstatistics and its dynamical realiza-

tions

2.1 The basic concept

Let us give a short introduction to the ‘superstatistics’ concept [6]. The
idea is actually applicable to many systems, not only to turbulent systems.
Consider a driven nonequilibrium systems with spatio-temporal ﬂuctuations
of an intensive parameter β. This can e.g. be the inverse temperature, or a
chemical potential, or a function of the ﬂuctuating energy dissipation in the
ﬂow (for the turbulence application). Locally, i.e. in cells where β is approx-
imately constant, the system is described by ordinary statistical mechanics,
i.e. ordinary Boltzmann factors e−βE, where E is an eﬀective energy in each
cell. To describe the system in the long-term run, one has to do a spatio-
temporal average over the ﬂuctuating β. One obtains a superposition of two
statistics (that of β and that of e−βE), hence the name ‘superstatistics’. One
may deﬁne an eﬀective Boltzmann factor B(E) given by

B(E) =

f (β)e−βE,

where f (β) is the probability distribution of β. For type-A superstatistics,
one normalizes this eﬀective Boltzmann factor, obtaining the stationary prob-
ability distribution

where Z(β) is the normalization constant of e−βE for a given β. Both ap-
proaches can be easily mapped into each other, by deﬁning a new probability
density ˜f (β)
f (β)/Z(β). It is obvious that Type-B superstatistics with f
is equivalent to type-A superstatistics with ˜f.

A simple dynamical realization of a superstatistics can be constructed by
considering stochastic diﬀerential equations with spatio-temporally ﬂuctuat-
ing parameters [5]. Consider the Langevin equation

˙u = γF (u) + σL(t),

where L(t) is Gaussian white noise, γ > 0 is a friction constant, σ describes
∂
∂u V (u) is a drift force. If γ and
the strength of the noise, and F (u) =
σ are constant then the stationary probability density of u is proportional
to e−βV (u), where β := γ
σ2 can be identiﬁed with the inverse temperature
of ordinary statistical mechanics. Most generally, however, we may let the
parameters γ and σ ﬂuctuate so that β = γ
σ2 has probability density f (β).
These ﬂuctuations are assumed to be on a long time scale so that the system

superstatistics considered. The above formulation corresponds to type-B
superstatistics.

2.2 Application to turbulent systems

In the turbulence application, the mathematics is the same as outlined above,
just the physical meaning of the variables u, β, E etc. is slightly diﬀerent from
that of an ordinary Brownian particle. First of all, u stands for a local veloc-
ity diﬀerence in the turbulent ﬂow. On a very small time scale, this velocity
diﬀerence is essentially the acceleration. It is really the velocity diﬀerence,
not the velocity itself that we want to understand. Velocity diﬀerences in tur-
bulence have been the subject of intensive investigations since the early work
of Kolmogorov. The velocity itself is known to be approximately Gaussian,
so we don’t need any sophisticated model to understand this.

The basic idea is that turbulent velocity diﬀerences locally relax with
a certain damping constant γ and are at the same time driven by rapidly
ﬂuctuating chaotic force diﬀerences. As a local momentum balance, we thus
end up with eq. (5), where we model the chaotic force diﬀerences by Gaussian
white noise. As has been shown in [12, 13], this approximation by Gaussian
white noise can be made rigorous if the chaotic force diﬀerences act on a
relatively small time scale as compared to γ−1 and if they have strong mixing
properties.

Next, one knows that in turbulent ﬂows the energy dissipation ǫ ﬂuctuates
in space and time. In our simple model, the dissipation process is described
by the damping constant γ. It is thus most naturally to assume that the
parameter β deﬁned as β := γ/σ2 is a simple function of the ﬂuctuating
energy dissipation in the ﬂow. For a while, there is local relaxation (energy
dissipation) with a certain value of β = γ/σ2, then this parameter changes
to a new value, and so on.

So unlike an ordinary Brownian particle, in the turbulence application u
is not velocity but velocity diﬀerence, moreover β is not inverse temperature
but a function of the ﬂuctuating energy dissipation in the ﬂow. Finally,
the correct interpretation of E is that of an eﬀective potential generating
the relaxation dynamics of u, so for example E = V (u) = 1
2u2 generates
a linear relaxation dynamics, whereas other functions V (u) generate more
complicated relaxation processes.

All one has to decide now is what the probability density of the parameter

4

β should be. It is known since the early papers by Kolmogorov in 1962 that
it is reasonable to assume that the probability density of energy dissipation
is approximately log-normal in a turbulent ﬂow. Hence, if β is a simple
power-law function of ǫ, this implies a lognormally distributed β. We thus
end up in a most natural way with log-normal superstatistics. If β is a more
complicated function of ǫ, we end up with other superstatistics.

The aim of our simple superstatistics models is neither to solve the tur-
bulence problem nor to fully reproduce the spatio-temporal dynamics of the
Navier-Stokes equation, but to have a very simple model that grasps some of
the most important statistical properties of turbulence and at the same time
is analytically tractable.

Formulas of this type were shown to very well ﬁt densities of velocity diﬀer-
ences u measured in a Taylor-Couette experiment [14]. Empirically one ob-
serves that the relation α = 2
q is satisﬁed by the experimentally measured
densities in this experiment. Using this relation, only one ﬁtting parameter
q remains, which is a function of the scale r on which the velocity diﬀerences
are measured and of the Reynolds number. Excellent ﬁts were obtained for
all spatial scales and all accessible Reynolds numbers. The slight asymmetry
of the measured distributions can be understood as well [11, 12, 14].

is the theoretical prediction for the stationary distribution of velocity diﬀer-
ences in the turbulent ﬂow if log-normal superstatistics is the correct model.
The integral cannot be evaluated in closed form, but the equation is easily
numerically integrated, and can be compared with experimentally measured
densities p(u). The distribution p(u) has variance 1 for the choice µ = √w,
hence only one parameter s2 remains if one compares with experimental data
sets that have variance 1.

The moments for the log-normal superstatistics distribution (15) can be
easily evaluated. All moments exist. The moments of a Gaussian distribution

Measuring the ﬂatness F2 of some experimental data thus provides a very

statistics.

In some recent work [16, 17], log-normal superstatistics and the gener-
alized Langevin dynamics (5) is related to a generalized Sawford model for
Lagrangian accelerations [18, 19]. This yields a power-law relation between
ǫ and β. The relevance of distributions of similar form as in eq. (15) has also
been emphasized in early work of Castaing et al. [20].

2.5 Other superstatistics

In principle, all kinds of distributions f (β) can be considered, leading to dif-
ferent superstatistics models. Which distribution f (β) is the most suitable
one, depends on the physical problem under consideration. As mentioned
above, for turbulent ﬂows there are some arguments that f (β) should be
approximately log-normal. The log-normal distribution is probably still an
approximation, it is not the last word, so presumably there are again some
deviations from this and the ultimate superstatistics model that is the most
relevant one to describe high-Reynolds number 3-dimensional turbulence is
simply not known yet. Nevertheless, for any superstatistics one can deﬁne
generalized entropies and (at least in principle) proceed to a generalized sta-
tistical mechanics description, following the ideas of [7]. A turbulent ﬂow,
by construction, is then a complex system of generalized statistical mechan-
ics that maximizes the above generalized entropies subject to suitable con-
straints.

An interesting point is that all superstatistics reduce to Tsallis statistics
for small eﬀective energies E: For small E they all have the same quadratic
ﬁrst-order correction to the ordinary Boltzmann factor. This can be easily
seen as follows. For any distribution f (β) with average β0 :=

σ2 :=

We see that for small E all superstatistics have a quadratic correction term
to the ordinary Boltzmann factor, and the coeﬃcient is the same as for
Tsallis statistics (= χ2-superstatistics) if the distribution f (β) is chosen with
the same variance σ2. In practice, one observes this ’universality’ even for

8

moderately large E: Many superstatistics are observed to yield pretty similar
results p(E) for moderately large E (see next section). Usually one observes
signiﬁcant diﬀerences only for very large values of E.

3 Comparison with experiments

3.1 Swinney’s data on Taylor-Couette ﬂow

Figs. 1 and 2 shows an experimentally measured p(u) of velocity diﬀerences
u at scale r = 92.5η in a Taylor-Couette ﬂow [14]. η denotes the Kolmogorov
length scale. The data have been rescaled to variance 1. The Taylor scale
Reynolds number is Rλ = 262. Apparently, there is excellent agreement
between the measured density and log-normal superstatistics as given by
eq. (15). The ﬁtting parameter for this example is s2 = 0.28. Note that s2
is the only ﬁtting parameter. The scale- and Reynolds number dependence
of s2 can be easily extracted from the measured ﬂatness of the distributions,
using eq. (23).

Fig. 3 shows that essentially the same curve as for log-normal super-
statistics can be also obtained if one uses Tsallis statistics, i.e. eq. (13) with
q. Indeed, the two theoretical curves can hardly be
q = 1.11 and α = 2
< 8. Signiﬁcant

diﬀerences only arise for much larger
. So both types of superstatistics are

compatible with the experimental data.

|

One theoretical advantage of log-normal superstatistics is that it does
not require a nonlinear force F (u), i.e. an α diﬀerent from 1, to ﬁt the data
perfectly. A linear forcing is completely suﬃcient in that case. The only
ﬁtting parameter that we use for the log-normal superstatistics is s2, since
the parameter µ is ﬁxed as µ = e

to give variance 1.

2 s2

Swinney et al. have also measured the probability distribution of the shear
stress S at the outer and inner cylinder in their Taylor-Couette experiment
[15]. This distribution is well approximated by a log-normal distribution,
at least for large values of S (see Fig. 4). The square of the shear stress is
essentially the energy dissipation ǫ in the ﬂow, and if

is some simple power-law function of ǫ then the measurements of the nearly
log-normal shear stress distribution indicate that the superstatistics param-
eter β should be approximately log-normally distributed as well. There are

(27)

·

indeed some theoretical arguments that suggest a power-law relation of type
(27), e.g. with κ =
3/2, see [17] for details. Hence Swinney’s measure-
ments are an indirect experimental hint towards the physical relevance of
log-normal superstatistics.

−

3.2 Bodenschatz’s data on Lagrangian accelerations

≈

Accelerations a of Lagrangian test particles in turbulent ﬂows are in practice
measured as velocity diﬀerences u on a small time scale τ of the order τη, the
Kolmogorov time. Hence a
u/τ . Fig. 5 shows the most recent measure-
ments of histograms of accelerations of Lagrangian test particles as obtained
in the experiment of Bodenschatz et al. [21, 22, 23]. The Reynolds number is
Rλ = 690. The measured distributions are reasonably well approximated by
Tsallis distributions of type (13) for moderately large accelerations (see e.g.
[24] for a comparison with α = 1 and Fig. 5 for a comparison with α = 0.5).
But for extremely large accelerations the data seem to systematically fall
below curves corresponding to Tsallis statistics, at least if the exponent α of
the potential V is kept in the physically reasonable range 1
1. As
shown in Fig. 5 as well, log-normal superstatistics provides a better ﬁt of
the tails, with s2 = 3.0 and using just a linear damping force, i.e. α = 1.
Since Bodenschatz’s data reach rather large accelerations a (in units of the
standard deviation), the measured tails of the distributions allow for a sensi-
tive distinction between various superstatistics. The main diﬀerence between
χ2-superstatistics and log-normal superstatistics is the fact that p(a) decays
with a power law for the former ones, whereas it decays with a more compli-
cated logarithmic law for the latter ones. For alternative ﬁtting approaches,
see [25].

2 ≤

≤

α

One remark is at order. The acceleration is actually experimentally de-
termined as a parabolic ﬁt of the measured position of the test particle on a
ﬁnite time scale τ of the order of τη , or as a velocity diﬀerence on the same
time scale. While in the early paper of the Bodenschatz group [21] no depen-
dence of the data on τ was mentioned, in the later paper [22] a signiﬁcant
dependence of the ﬂatness of the distributions on τ was described (Fig. 28
in [22]). The ﬂatness of the distribution is signiﬁcantly linked to the tails,
larger ﬂatness certainly means tails that lie higher. So the shape of all mea-
sured distributions actually depends on the seemingly arbitrary parameter τ .
What the asymptotics is for τ
0 depends on extrapolation assumptions.
In addition, the tails

will presumably still change shape with increasing Reynolds number. We are
theoretically interested in the inﬁnite Reynolds number case, which could
still be very diﬀerent from the ﬁnite-Reynolds number case. The inﬁnite
Reynolds number case could still be correctly described by Tsallis statistics.
And ﬁnally, does a ﬁnite-size test particle in the experimental ﬂow really fol-
low completely the extremely strong forces in the ﬂow, which are supposed
to accelerate it to accelerations of up to 2000 g? No astronaut would survive
this! So it may well be that the measured extreme tails of p(a) contain some
systematic negative corrections, simply because the particle cannot follow
those extreme forces. Summa summarum, one should be very cautious when
drawing over-ambitious conclusions that are solely based on ﬁts of extreme
tail data. The tails describe acceleration events that are a million times more
unlikely than events near the maximum of the distribution.

3.3 Gotoh’s DNS data

Fig. 6 shows Gotoh’s results on the pressure distribution as obtained by direct
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation at Rλ = 380 [26]. A direct
numerical simulation is also a kind of experiment, just that it is done on a
computer. One usually assumes that in reasonably good approximation the
pressure statistics coincides with the acceleration statistics of a Lagrangian
test particle. Gotoh’s histograms reach accelerations up to 150 (in units
of the standard deviation), a much larger statistics than can be presently
reached in Bodenschatz’s experiment. Hence the tails of these distributions
can very sensitively be used to distinguish various superstatistics models.

Fig. 6 shows that log-normal superstatistics with s2 = 3.0 and linear
forcing again yields a good ﬁt of the tails, keeping in mind that one compares
data that vary over 12 orders of magnitude.

Near the maximum of the distributions, the ﬁt quality of log-normal su-
perstatistics is not very good: p(0) is too big as compared to the DNS data.
But this defect can be easily cured by introducing an upper cutoﬀ in β. That
is to say, in eq. (15) we only integrate up to a certain βmax and re-normalize
afterwards. Log-normal superstatistics with an upper cutoﬀ of βmax ≈
32
yields quite a perfect ﬁt in the vicinity of the maximum (Fig. 7). The tails
are not inﬂuenced by this cutoﬀ. The above truncation may eﬀectively repre-
sent ﬁnite size or ﬁnite Reynolds number eﬀects, which are certainly present
in any numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation.

As Fig. 8 shows, Tsallis statistics with q = 1.476 and α = 0.832 also

11

yields a very good ﬁt of the data in the vicinity of the maximum (the rela-
tion between q and α is q = 1 + 2α/(3α + 1), the theoretical prediction of
the model considered in [5] with n = 3 spatial dimensions). But for very
large accelerations Tsallis statistics implies power-law tails, which are not
supported by the ﬁnite-Reynolds number DNS data.

Of course the following general question arises: How much can we believe
in the extreme tails of a DNS simulation? It should be clear that every DNS
is a brute force ﬁnite lattice size approximation of the Navier-Stokes equa-
tion. Naturally there are ﬁnite-lattice size eﬀects, also ﬁnite lattice constant
eﬀects, and moreover ﬁnite Reynolds number eﬀects, which may heavily in-
ﬂuence the extreme tails. Moreover, do the extreme events of 150 standard
deviations, corresponding to accelerations of almost 10000 g, really describe
plausible physics? Can a true physical test particle really follow such a force?
10−8
Bodenschatz’s experiment, tracking single test particles, leads to p(a)
for the most rare acceleration events. The detector for these measurements
was running for about a month to collect the data. Gotoh’s DNS data reach
10−12 for the rarest acceleration events. This statistics is larger by a
p(a)
factor 104. Hence Bodenschatz, in a laboratory experiment similar to the one
he did so far, would need to wait 104 months
1000 years to observe one of
the extreme acceleration events described by Gotoh’s numerical simulation.
I guess most physicists are not willing to wait that long.

4 Conclusion

By analyzing three diﬀerent data sets obtained by Swinney, Bodenschatz,
Gotoh, respectively, we have shown that measured and simulated densities
in Eulerian and Lagrangian turbulence experiments are well described by
simple superstatistics models. Log-normal superstatistics diﬀers from χ2-
superstatistics, i.e. ordinary Tsallis statistics, but for moderately large veloc-
ity diﬀerences log-normal superstatistics can be quite close to Tsallis statis-
tics, as shown e.g. in Fig. 3. The fact that this is so is not surprising but
simply a consequence of the ‘universality’ property discussed in section 2.5.
For small eﬀective energies E (i.e. small u or a in the turbulence application)
any superstatistics is close to Tsallis statistics. In practice we see that this is
often also the case for moderately large velocity diﬀerences and accelerations.
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences only arise for very large velocity diﬀerences (and large
accelerations), where Tsallis statistics predicts a power law decay of proba-

12

bility density functions, whereas log-normal superstatistics yields tails that
decay in a more complicated way. It is indeed the tails contain the informa-
tion on the most appropriate superstatistics for turbulent ﬂows. A precise
estimate of the error bars of the tails of experimentally measured or simu-
lated distributions is clearly needed, taking into account not only statistical
errors but all systematic errors as well. Moreover, one would wish for precise
data on how the shape of the tails depends on the time scale on which the
accelerations are measured, and how the tails change with Reynolds number.
Finally, it would be interesting to have precise data on correlation functions
of accelerations, since these yield more information than the densities alone.

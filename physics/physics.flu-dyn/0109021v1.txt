Abstract

The self-gravitating instability of a compressible-inviscid ﬂuid cylinder im-
mersed into a self-gravitating tenuous medium of negligible motion is developed.
The stability criterion is derived based on the linear perturbation technique. Some
previous reported works are recovered. The eﬀect of diﬀerent factors on the ﬂuid
cylinder instability is discussed. The compressibility has a tendency for a sta-
bilizing the model in particular as the sound speed a is very large in the stable
domains 1.0233928
but comparatively small in the unstable domains
0 < x < 1.0233928 where x = kR0 is the dimensionless longitudinal wavenumber
with k is the axial wavenumber and R0 is the radius of the cylinder. In the absence
of the compressibility factor the unstable domain is found to be 0 < x < 1.0678.

1. Introduction

The instability of a self-gravitating incompressible ﬂuid cylinder has been in-
vestigated for ﬁrst time by Chandrasekher and Fermi [1]. They have utilized
the method of presenting the solinoidal vectors in terms of poloidal and toriodal
quantities which is valid only for axisymmetric perturbations. Chandrasekher [2]
derived the stability criterion of such model for axisymmetric and non axisym-
metric modes by using the normal mode analysis technique. Several extensions
for such studies have been carried out upon considering the eﬀect of diﬀerent
factors on the self-gravitating force [3, 4].

The purpose of the present work is to discuss the stability of a self-gravitating
compressible ﬂuid cylinder by utilizing the normal mode analysis. However, such
technique is diﬀerent from that used previously by Chandrasekher [2] and Radwan
[3], because the velocity ﬁeld in a compressible ﬂuid is no longer solinoidal, i.e,

u

= 0.

2. Basic equations

We consider a selfgravitating ﬂuid cylinder of radius R0 embedded into a self
gravitating tenuous medium of negligible motion. The ﬂuid is assumed to be
non-viscous and compressible. The model is acted upon by the self-gravitating
and pressure gradient forces. We shall use the cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z)
with the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the cylinder.

The basic equations appropriate for the present problem are the equations of
motion, continuity equation, equation of state and the equations satisfying the
self-gravitating potentials interior and exterior the ﬂuid cylinder. These equations
could be written in the form

medium exterior the ﬂuid cylinder, γ is the ratio of the speciﬁc heats and G is the
gravitational constant. Here the superscript e denotes the exterior of the ﬂuid
cylinder. In the equilibrium state we have

By integrating equations (6) and (7) with respect to r and determining the con-
stants of integration. The latter may be determined upon applying the boundary
condition that the self-gravitating potential and its derivative must be continuous
across the boundary surface at r = R0 . Consequently, the non-singular solutions
of equations (6) and (7) are given by

where C0 is an arbitrary constant. In the present initial state, equation (1) yields

By integrating equation (10) and determining the integration constant (note that
p

state is given by

studies for diﬀerent models acted upon capillary or/and electromagnetic forces,
[2], where it is found that p

ear perturbation technique concerning stability theory, every perturbed quantity
Q1(r, ϕ, z, t) could be expressed as e(σt+i(kz+mϕ)) times an amplitude function of
r. Consequently, the self-gravitating equations (18) and (19) are solved. Upon

The relation (29) has been derived for ﬁrst time by Chandrasekhar and Fermi
[1]. Indeed they have used a technique which is totally diﬀerent from that used
here. Such a technique is based on presenting the solinoidal vectors in terms of
poloidal and toroidal quantities.

As the compressibility factor inﬂuence is very small, the eﬀect of the self-
gravitating force on the instability of the ﬂuid cylinder may be determined upon
discussing the relation (27) and (28).

By the aid of the numerical data of the modiﬁed Bessel functions [5], it is

found for all m

Therefore, the ﬂuid cylinder is gravitationally stable for all purely non-axisymmetric
perturbations. In the axisymmetric perturbation mode m = 0 it is found that

where the equality corresponds to the marginal stability state.

Now, as we have seen in the foregoing discussion the self-gravitating incom-
pressible ﬂuid cylinder is unstable only in the axisymmetric mode m = 0. There-
fore, in discussing the general relation (26) for determining the inﬂuence of the
compressibility, we focus our stability discussions for in the axisymmetric pertur-
bation mode m = 0. For m = 0, the relation (26) reduces to

where the dimensionless compressible wavenumber y is still given by (27). The
relation (36) has been calculated in the computer and the eﬀect of diﬀerent factors
are identiﬁed. See ﬁgure (1) and table (1). The analytical results are veriﬁed and
it is found that the compressibility destabilizing the model for diﬀerent values of
a in particular as the sound speed a is very large. It is worthwhile to mention here
s < 5.0 (with s = a/R0) we found
also that for all values of s in the range 0.1
that the model is unstable in the domain 0 < x < 1.0233928. While it is stable
in the neighboring domains 1.0233928
where the equality corresponds

to the marginal stable state. However, with increasing s values the areas under
the unstable curves are increasing. Corresponding to s = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and

and 0.66. This means that the compressibility has a tendency of destabilizing
the model. On contrary as s = 0 we have the selfgravitating unstable domain
is 0 < x < 1.0678. This shows that all the unstable domain is the presence
of compressibility are less than that in the absence of the compressibility. This
means that the compressibility has a tendency of stabilizing the model.

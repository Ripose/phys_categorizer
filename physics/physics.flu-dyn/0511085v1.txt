We study the distributions of channel openings, local ﬂuxes, and velocities in a two-dimensional
random medium of non-overlapping disks. We present theoretical arguments supported by numeri-
cal data of high precision and ﬁnd scaling laws as function of the porosity. For the channel openings
we observe a crossover to a highly correlated regime at small porosities. The distribution of veloc-
ities through these channels scales with the square of the porosity. The ﬂuxes turn out to be the
convolution of velocity and channel width corrected by a geometrical factor. Furthermore, while
the distribution of velocities follows a Gaussian, the ﬂuxes are distributed according to a stretched
exponential with exponent 1/2. Finally, our scaling analysis allows to express the tortuosity and
pore shape factors from the Kozeny-Carman equation as direct average properties from microscopic
quantities related to the geometry as well as the ﬂow through the disordered porous medium.

Fluid ﬂow through a porous medium is of importance
in many practical situations ranging from oil recovery to
chemical reactors and has been studied experimentally
and theoretically for a long time [1, 2]. Due to disorder,
porous media display many interesting properties that
are however diﬃcult to handle even numerically. One
important feature is the presence of heterogeneities in
the ﬂux intensities due the varying channel widths. They
are crucial to understand stagnation, ﬁltering, dispersion
and tracer diﬀusion. These are subjects of much practical
interest in medicine, chemical engineering and geology
and on which a vast literature is available [3].

Many stochastic models for disordered porous media
have been proposed and used to describe the above men-
tioned eﬀects. One of the most successful is the so-called
q-model for force distributions in random packings [4] in
which a scalar ﬂuid is transfered downwards from layer
to layer. Although the distribution of local ﬂux intensi-
ties should be the basis for any quantitative evolution of
these stochastic models, detailed studies of them at the
pore level are still lacking.

The traditional approach for the investigation of single-
phase ﬂuid ﬂow at low Reynolds number in disordered
porous media is to characterize the system in terms of
Darcy’s law [1, 3], which assumes that a macroscopic
index, the permeability K, relates the average ﬂuid ve-
locity V through the pores with the pressure drop ∆P
measured across the system,

V =

where L is the length of the sample in the ﬂow direction
and µ is the viscosity of the ﬂuid. In fact, the permeabil-
ity reﬂects the complex interplay between porous struc-
ture and ﬂuid ﬂow, where local aspects of the pore space

morphology and the relevant mechanisms of momentum
transfer should be adequately considered.
In previous
studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], computational simulations
based on detailed models of pore geometry and ﬂuid ﬂow
have been used to predict permeability coeﬃcients as well
as to validate semi-empirical correlations obtained from
real porous materials.

In this paper we present numerical calculations for a
ﬂuid ﬂowing through a two-dimensional channel of width
Ly and length Lx ﬁlled with randomly positioned circu-
lar obstacles. For instance, this type of model has been
frequently used to study ﬂow through ﬁbrous ﬁlters [12].
Here the ﬂuid ﬂows in the x-direction at low but non-
zero Reynolds number and in the y-direction we impose
periodic boundary conditions. We consider a particular
type of random sequential adsorption (RSA) model [13]
in two dimensions to describe the geometry of the porous
medium. As shown in Fig. 1, disks of diameter D are
placed randomly by ﬁrst choosing from a homogeneous
distribution between D/2 and Lx
D/2) the
random x-(y-)coordinates of their center. If the disk al-
located at this position is separated by a distance smaller
than D/10 or overlaps with an already existing disk, this
attempt of placing a disk is rejected and a new attempt is
made. Each successful placing constitutes a decrease in
the porosity (void fraction) ǫ by πD2/4LxLy. One can
associate this ﬁlling procedure to a temporal evolution
and identify a successful placing of a disk as one time
step. By stopping this procedure when a certain value
of ǫ is achieved, we can produce in this way systems of
well controlled porosity. We study in particular conﬁgu-
rations with ǫ = 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.

First we analyze the geometry of our random conﬁg-
urations making a Voronoi construction of the point set
given by the centers of the disks [14, 15]. We deﬁne two
disks to be neighbors of each other if they are connected
by a bond of the Voronoi tessellation. These bonds con-
stitute therefore the openings or pore channels through
which a ﬂuid can ﬂow when it is pushed through our

a low Reynolds number and periodic boundary conditions ap-
plied in the y-direction. The ﬂuid is pushed from left to right.
The colors ranging from blue (dark) to red (light) correspond
to low and high velocity magnitudes, respectively. The close-
up shows a typical pore opening of length l across which the
ﬂuid ﬂows with a line average velocity ~v. The local ﬂux at
the pore opening is given by q = vl cos θ, where θ is the angle
between ~v and the vector normal to the line connecting the

We measure the channel widths l as the length of these
bonds minus the diameter D and plot in Fig. 2 the (nor-
malized) distributions of the normalized channel widths
l∗ = l/D for the four diﬀerent porosities. Clearly one no-
tices two distinct regimes: (i) for large widths l∗ the dis-
tribution decays seemingly exponentially with l∗, and (ii)
for small l∗ it has a strong dependence on the porosity, in-
creasing dramatically at the origin with decreasing poros-
ity. A closer investigation shows that in Fig. 2 the large
l∗ tail decays like a Gaussian for large porosities while
it is a simple exponential when the porosity is around
or below 0.7. The crossover between the two regimes is
visible as a peak which shifts between ǫ = 0.9 and 0.8
and then stays for smaller porosities at about l∗ = 1,
i.e., l = D. These distribution functions can be quali-
tatively understood in the following way. For very large
porosities, i.e., very dilute systems, the distance between
the particles is essentially uncorrelated due to excluded
volume and is therefore Gaussian distributed around a

The ﬂuid mechanics in the porous space is based on the
assumption that a Newtonian and incompressible ﬂuid
ﬂows under steady-state conditions. The Navier-Stokes

slip boundary conditions are applied along the entire
solid-ﬂuid interface, whereas a uniform velocity proﬁle,
ux(0, y) = V and uy(0, y) = 0, is imposed at the in-
let of the channel. For simplicity, we restrict our study
to the case where the Reynolds number, deﬁned here as
ρV Ly/µ, is suﬃciently low (Re < 1) to ensure a

grid of up to hundred thousand points adapted to the
geometry of the porous medium.

Simulations have been performed by averaging over 10
diﬀerent pore space realizations generated for each value
of porosity. The contour plot in Fig. 1 of the local ve-
locity magnitude for a typical realization of the porous
medium with porosity ǫ = 0.7 clearly reveals that the
transport of momentum through the complex geometry
generates preferential channels [11]. Once the numerical
solution for the velocity and pressure ﬁelds in each cell
of the numerical grid is obtained, we compute the ﬂuid
velocity magnitudes v associated to each channel. This
value is the magnitude of the line average velocity vector
~v calculated as the average over the local velocity vectors
~u along the corresponding channel width l.

In Fig. 3 we show the data collapse of all distribu-
tions of normalized velocity magnitudes P (v∗), where
v∗ = v/V , obtained by rescaling the variable v∗ with the
corresponding value of ǫ−2. It is also interesting to note
that these rescaled distributions follow a typical Gaus-
sian behavior except for very small v∗ǫ2, as indicated by
the solid line in Fig. 3.
In the inset of Fig. 3 we also
show that the average interstitial velocity indeed scales

tions P (v∗) in the main plot of Fig. 3. Plotting for each

considered values of ǫ results in a rather unexpected least

We now analyse the distribution of ﬂuxes throughout
the porous medium. Each local ﬂux q crossing its corre-
sponding pore opening l is given by q = vl cos θ, where θ

section of the channel (see Fig. 1). In Fig. 4 we show that

form,

ple form of Eq. (5) is quite unexpected considering the
rather complex dependence of P (l) on ǫ. Moreover, all
ﬂux distributions P (φ) collapse on top of each other when
ǫ2. This col-
rescaled by the corresponding value of
lapse for distinct porous media results from the fact that
mass conservation is imposed at the microscopic level of
the geometrical model adopted here, which is microscop-
ically disordered, but at a larger scale is macroscopically
homogeneous [3]. As also shown in Fig. 4, it is possible
to reconstruct the distribution of ﬂuxes using a convolu-
tion of the distribution of velocities v and the distribution
of oriented channel widths, namely lcosθ. Indeed, if we

Finally, the inset of Fig. 4 shows that the permeability

tion of channel widths in a porous medium made by a

D, the distribution of ﬂuxes
hibits a crossover at l
through these channels shows an astonishingly simple be-
havior, namely a square-root stretched exponential dis-
tribution that scales in a simple way with the porosity.
The velocity magnitudes follow a Gaussian distribution
truncated at small velocities which scales with the square
of the porosity. The distribution of ﬂuxes can be recon-
structed as a convolution of the velocity with the channel
widths distributions corrected by the velocity orientation
factor cos θ. We propose simple scaling laws for the local
ﬂuxes that deepen the understanding of the intrinsic con-
nection between geometrical and ﬂow properties of the
random porous medium. Furthermore, we show that our
results can be macroscopically described in terms of the
Kozeny-Carman relation. Future tasks consist in gener-
alizing these studies to higher Reynolds numbers, three
dimensional model of porous media and other types of
disorder. Other important challenges are to investigate
transient ﬂow and tracer dynamics.

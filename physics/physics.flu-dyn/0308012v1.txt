Nonstandard picture of turbulence

The nonstandard picture of a turbulent ﬁeld is presented in this article. By the concepts of
nonstandard mathematics the picture describes the hierarchical structure of turbulence and shows
the mechanism of the ﬂuctuation appearing in a turbulent ﬁeld. The uncertainty of measurement
is pointed out. And the fundamental equations of turbulence are given too. It is natural in this
picture that a reasonable closure method can be obtained and seems to be precise.

1 Some Concepts of Nonstandard Analysis

On the basis of mathematic logic A.Robinson [1] proved in the sixties

of the last century that a real number system R can be expanded into the

hyperreal number system R∗. Besides all real numbers (so-called standard

numbers) R∗ contains also hyperreal numbers (i.e., nonstandard numbers).

The inﬁnitesimal ε and inﬁnite L are elementary nonstandard numbers. There

are other nonstandard numbers, for example, ξ ± ε, ξε, ξL, ξ ± L, εε, LL, etc.

(ξ any real number).

It is known that real numbers correspond one by one to the points on

a real line, but there are no such points on the real line which correspond

to nonstandard numbers.

In other words nonstandard numbers can not be

indicated by use of the points on a real line. The concept of monad needs to

be presented to indicate the nonstandard numbers. For each real number ξ

there exists a monad that is composed of the numbers inﬁnitely close to ξ and

ξ belongs also to the monad. In fact, there exist inﬁnite monads containing the

real number ξ. The size of all these monads is inﬁnitesimal ε. The numbers in

this monad except ξ are all nonstandard numbers with ξ being standard part

of them.

So any point on a real line is expanded into a monad. The real number

represented by the point is the standard part of the nonstandard numbers

contained in the monad. And a real line formed by the points indicating only

real numbers is expanded into a hyperreal line composed of monads. The set of

the standard parts of all these monads composes the original real line. Every

monad on a hyperreal line is also called a point (standard point). Clearly every

such standard point is not the absolute point having the length of absolute zero,

but it is the monad having inﬁnitesimal length ε.

Every monad must contain and only contains one real number. If a monad

contains the real number ξ, we call the monad as monad of ξ.

The physical world is in a hierarchical structure. This hierarchical struc-

ture can be described by use of the concepts of nonstandard mathematics. For

example, there are three levels:

level α (having inﬁnitesimal ε, inﬁnite ε−1),

level β (inﬁnitesimal ε3, inﬁnite ε) and level γ (inﬁnitesimal ε−1, inﬁnite ε−3).

Any monad on a hyperreal line in level α is also a whole hyperreal line in level

β, yet the whole hyperreal line in level α is only a monad of the hyperreal axis

in higher level γ. From the point of view of hierarchical structure the mean-

ings of inﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal are not ﬁxed. It is understandable in physics.

Physicists, in fact, can even determine how large inﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal are

2

in a speciﬁc physical problem, and often take a certain number as inﬁnite (in-

ﬁnitesimal). In physics any number (not absolute zero) is taken sometimes as

inﬁnite, inﬁnitesimal or ﬁnite. What actually happens should be in accordance

with speciﬁc conditions.

The coordinate systems in two levels will be set up for the convenience

of description. Let space coordinates be (x1, x2, x3), time t in level α and

space (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3), time t′ in level β, the range of values of (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) be

[0, L1), [0, L2), [0, L3) and [0, T ) respectively. Here L1, L2, L3 and T are the

inﬁnites of space and time respectively, in level α. For any time-space point

(~x, t) in level α the monad of this point is expressed by (~x, t) and the dimensions

of which are (ε1, ε2, ε3, εt). Here ε1, ε2, ε3, εt are inﬁnitesimals of space and time,

respectively, in level α. Moreover assume that:

ε1L1 = 1,

ε2L2 = 1,

ε3L3 = 1,

εtT = 1

(1)

However the distance between any two points in the space

∆l =

(∆x1)2 + (∆x2)2 + (∆x3)3

in level α, and

is:

∆l′ =

(∆x′

1)2 + (∆x′

2)2 + (∆x′

3)2

in level β. The actual length (i.e., observed from the angle of level α) of ∆l′

(∆x′

1ε2

1)2 + (∆x′

2ε2

2)2 + (∆x′

3ε2

3)2

(2)

q

If ε1 = ε2 = ε3 = ε the actual length of ∆l′ is:

Similarly the actual value (observed from level t) of ∆t′ is:

(3)

(4)

And the lengths of the whole space and time axes in level β (observed from

level α) are:

L1ε2

1 = ε1, L2ε2

2 = ε2, L3ε2

3 = ε3,

T ε2

t = εt

(5)

They are just the dimensions of a monad in level α.

Now the limit of tending to zero (∆xi → 0) in level α is not the process of

tending to absolute zero but to inﬁnitesmal ε. Here ∆xi can not go into the

inner of the monad of (0). In the inner of the monad of (0) in level α there

exists not ∆xi but, instead, ∆x′

i. In other words, the process of tending to

zero does not mean tending to absolute zero but to the dimension of a monad

in the same level. The standard part of any number ω is denoted by Stω. To

show clearly the meanings of ∆xi → 0 and ∆t → 0 mentioned above we do

not use the notation ∆xi → 0 and ∆t → 0 but,instead,

St∆xi → 0,

St∆t → 0

In other words, the deﬁnitions of (∆xi → εi) and (∆t → εt) are, respectively,

(St∆xi → 0) and (St∆t → 0). Similarly the limit of tending to inﬁnite does

not mean tending to absolute inﬁnite but to the nonstandard number L, i.e.,

lim
∆x1→∞

∆x1 = L1,

lim
∆x2→∞

∆x2 = L2,

lim
∆x3→∞

∆x3 = L3,

lim
∆t→∞

∆t = T

(8)

Moreover, in the standard case a function is expressed by f (x1, x2, x3, t)

which represents the function value at the standard point (x1, x2, x3, t). How-

ever, in the nonstandard analysis a point (x1, x2, x3, t) is a monad within which

there are still inﬁnite nonstandard points (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′). Then a function should

be expressed by f (x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) which is the function value at the

nonstandard point (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) contained in the monad (x1, x2, x3, t). Still

we give in form the deﬁnitions of partial derivatives:

(10)

Deﬁnition (9) has the same, not merely the form, meaning as ordinary deriva-

tive in the standard analysis, but (10) is only a formal deﬁnition not having the

ordinary meaning of derivative in the standard case. The diﬀerence of [f (xi +

∆xi) − f (xi)] in (10) is the abbreviation of [f (xi + ∆xi, xj, xk, t, x′

k, t′) −
k, t′)], the increment of the function value between two

monads of (xi + ∆xi) and (xi). The distance between the points

and

is inﬁnite from the angle of level β. If one insists on the concept of ordinary

derivative in the standard case, ∂f

and ∂f

∂t in(10) have no sense.

2 Nonstandard Model Of Turbulence

On the basis of the above-mentioned concepts of the nonstandard analysis

the nonstandard description of a turbulent ﬁeld can be presented as follows.

Assumption 1: Global turbulent ﬁeld is composed of standard points,

and every standard point is yet a monad. Each monad possesses

the internal structure within it, namely a monad is also composed of

inﬁnite nonstandard points (so called interior points of the monad).

It is well known that a space is formed from the points. In ﬂuid mechanics

ﬂuid mechanists take always the ﬂuid element (ﬂuid particle) as point.

In

fact, a ﬂuid particle has the volume not to be absolute zero but to be a micro

volume taken as inﬁnitesimal from macroscopic viewpoint and inﬁnite from

microscope. People generally think of the ﬂuid particle wholly as uniform.

Namely the ﬂuid particle is taken to be equal to a point in reality. Now, in the

case of turbulence the motion of ﬂuid varies very fast so that a ﬂuid particle can

not be uniform as a whole and becomes a monad. From now on the meanings

of a ﬂuid particle, a monad on a whole and a standard point are identical with

6

each other and so are the meanings of a ﬂuid particle in the lower level, an

interior point of a monad and a nonstandard point in this paper.

Since the point of the global turbulent ﬁeld becomes a monad with internal

structure in it, the motion features of diﬀerent interior points of the monad are

diﬀerent. So it is not too much to say that there is a ﬂow or ﬂow ﬁeld in the

inner of the monad. Hence a ﬂuid particle (monad) is made up of nonstandard

points. The volume of these nonstandard points is also not absolute zero,

and these nonstandard points, in fact, are the ﬂuid particles in the lower level.

Now the particles in the lower level are thought to be uniform. They are points

(nonstandard points) actually. Moreover a lot of ﬂuid molecules are included

still in the ﬂuid particle of the lower level.

Therefore two kinds of ﬂow ﬁelds exist in turbulence. The one is the global

turbulent ﬁeld and the other is the ﬂow ﬁeld in a monad ( so called monad

ﬁeld). They are ﬂow ﬁelds in two diﬀerent levels. Now the global turbulent

ﬁeld is not composed of the points in which there are no structures, but of

monad ﬁelds. According to the knowledge of ﬂuid mechanics a reasonable

assumption about the ﬂow states of monad ﬁelds can be given. Clearly the

ﬂow in a monad ﬁeld is laminar because the dimensions of the monad are very

small (being inﬁnitesimal in principle).

Assumption 2: The ﬂows in monad ﬁelds are laminar.

Then the motion-equations of the ﬂows in monad ﬁelds can be written as

follows (for incompressible ﬂuid, unsteadiness and three dimensions):

∂Ui
(ε2∂x′)i

= 0

7

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

∂Ui
t ∂t′ +
ε2

∂UiUj
(ε2∂x′)j

=

1
ρ

∂σij
(ε2∂x′)j

Here Ui is velocity component in i-direction, ρ density of ﬂuid, σij stress ten-

sor and σij = σji. The independent variables of these functions in (11)-(12)

are all (x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′). εt, ε1, ε2, ε3 are inﬁnitesimals (i.e., the lin-

ear dimensions of a monad) of time t, space x1, x2 and x3, respectively. Let

εt = ε1 = ε2 = ε3 = ε here and later, then the governing equations becomes:

∂Ui
∂x′
i

= 0

∂Ui
∂t′ +

∂UiUj
∂x′
j

=

1
ρ

∂σij
∂x′
j

The governing equations (11)-(12) show the internal structure of a monad.

For an actual turbulence the possible linear dimensions of ﬂow ﬁelds in

two levels could be estimated roughly as follows:

Global turbulent ﬁeld:

inﬁnite

L = ε−1 ∼ 101.5cm

Monad ﬁeld:

inﬁnite

ε ∼ 10−1.5 − 10−2cm

inﬁnitesimal

ε ∼ 10−1.5 − 10−2cm

(linear dimension of a monad)

inﬁnitesimal

ε3 ∼ 10−4.5 − 10−5cm

(linear dimension of the particle of lower level)

According to this estimation one space monad of the turbulent ﬁeld con-

tains 109 − 1010 more or less nonstandard points (the particles in the lower

level). If the ﬂuid is gas, there are 105 − 106 more or less gas molecules in one

nonstandard point of a monad ﬁeld. This number of gas molecules is enough

8

for stable mean values in the statistical average.

Assumption 3: Turbulent ﬁeld is continuous.

Here the meanings of continuity are: ﬁrst the global turbulent ﬁeld is

composed continuously of standard points (i.e., monad ﬁelds), secondly the

ﬂows in the monad ﬁelds are continuous, and thirdly the physical quantities

on the interface between two inﬁnitely close monads are continuous too. The

mathematic expression of the third is

lim
St∆x→0

U(x + ∆x, 0) = lim
x′→L

U(x, x′),

lim
St∆t→0

U(t + ∆t, 0) = lim
t′→T

U(t, t′)

(15)

There is an even more important meaning of the continuity. That will be

stated in Assumption 6.

3 Uncertainty Of Measurement

To make a physical measurement some time-space point (x1, x2, x3, t) has

to be assigned ﬁrst at which the measurement is carried out. The results of

the measurement are taken as the measuring data of this point (x1, x2, x3, t).

According to the standpoint of nonstandard analysis the point (x1, x2, x3, t)

is not an absolute point but a monad in which there are inﬁnite nonstandard

points. Generally the motion features of diﬀerent nonstandard points are dif-

ferent. So the meaning of saying “measuring at point (x1, x2, x3, t)” becomes

ambiguous. Obviously if there are ﬁelds in two diﬀerent levels in the system

being studied, there must exist the new meaning of a measurement at any

point of the ﬁeld in higher level.

Assumption 4: When a measurement at any point (monad) (x1, x2, x3, t)

in a physical ﬁeld is taken, the operation of the measurement will

9

act randomly on one interior point (nonstandard point) of the point

(x1, x2, x3, t).

This assumption states clearly that one measuring operation at some stan-

dard point (monad) in a ﬁeld will always take place at an interior point of such

a monad. But the measurer can not determine which interior point is acted on

by the measuring operation. What actually happens is randomly. The mea-

surer knows only the standard point (monad) in which the interior point acted

on by one measurement operation is contained. It is surprising that when a

measurement is carried out there is no way to determine the exact position of

the measured object. That is the uncertainty of measurement. At ﬁrst sight it

seems that the uncertainty of measurement should stem from the rough mea-

suring skill and that the environmental conditions of the measurement are not

exactly controllable etc.. After further thinking, it is comprehended that the

uncertainty rises essentially from the limited ability and means of the descrip-

tion of the physical world in a hierarchical structures. Apparently, in their

quest of the laws of the universe people need not (and can not in fact) describe

all motion states of every molecule and electron in the universe. Conversely,

even though an exact and perfect description of the motion states of every

molecule and electron in the universe is given the laws of the motion of the

whole universe are still not understood. It is clearly that because the physi-

cal world has a hierarchical structure, therefore any description and measure-

ment of physical phenomena should be related with the hierarchical structure.

Thus, in the problems in which the eﬀect of the hierarchical structure can

not be ignored the uncertainty of measurement occurs. The measurement and

10

observation of turbulence can be taken for examples of this case.

An operation of measurement will act randomly on various interior points

in a monad. By what probability does the measuring operation act on each

interior point of a monad? In turbulence it is thought that one operation

of measurement will take place in equiprobability at each interior point of a

monad.

Assumption 5: When a measurement at any point (monad) of a tur-

bulent ﬁeld is made the operation of the measurement will act in

equiprobability on various interior points of the monad. This as-

sumption is called the equiprobability assumption.

So there are two kinds of averages. The one is that one measurement is

just taking average over a large number of molecules contained in some interior

point of a monad, while the other average over the motions of all interior points

in a monad has to be taken in order to get the mean values of the physical

quantities over the standard point(monad) of the turbulent ﬁeld. According to

the equiprobability assumption the second average formula can be given. Let

U(~x, t, ~x′, t′) represent some physical quantity at an interior point (~x′, t′) of the

monad (~x, t) and

U (~x, t) express the average of U(~x, t, ~x′, t′) over all interior

points of the monad. Then it follows that

e

U (~x, t) =

(16)

(~x′, t′) ≡ (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′), and T, L are inﬁnites of time and space respectively.

Let T = L1 = L2 = L3 = L here and later. Obviously

U is a function of only

e

11

the standard point (~x, t).

If the monad ﬁelds of a global ﬂow ﬁeld are uniform, there is no diﬀerence

between saying “one measurement acting on the interior point of a monad”

and “one measurement acting on the point (standard point)”. Then the global

ﬁeld is laminar. The essential feature of turbulence is exactly that its particle

(standard point) has internal structure, i.e., internal ﬂow ﬁeld (monad ﬁeld)

within it. That could be taken as the deﬁnition of turbulence.

Because of the uncertainty of measurement one measurement at the point

(~x, t) will act randomly on any interior point of (~x, t), therefore, the results

of many measurements carried out at the same point(monad) under constant

environmental conditions will indicate randomly the motion states of various

interior points of the monad. Surely ﬂuctuation of data of the measurements

must appear provided that there are obvious diﬀerent states among various in-

terior points of the monad. This is the mechanism of the ﬂuctuation appearing

in a turbulent ﬁeld.

Thus a turbulent ﬁeld is composed of monads having interior structure

(monad ﬁeld) within them. The ﬂows in the monad ﬁelds are laminar ﬂows

controlled by the governing equations of (13)-(14). Still continuity of a turbu-

lent ﬁeld exists. Therefore turbulences are also regular ﬂows. The appearance

of the ﬂuctuation of a turbulent ﬂow stems from the uncertainty of measure-

ment and observation carried out in the turbulent ﬁeld.

To keep the concepts mentioned above in mind the order of magnitude

of the ﬂuctuation in a turbulent ﬁeld can be estimated roughly. Let ∆x′ be

ﬁnite length in the coordinate system of a monad, U ∼ 0(1) any physical

quantity and its ﬂuctuation u = U(x′ + ∆x′) − U(x′) ∼ ∂U

∂x′ ∆x′. At the interior

12

point (x′) the actual rate of change (i.e., observed from the angle of the global

ﬁeld level) of the function U is

∂U
ε2∂x′ .

In one case ∂U

no obvious ﬂuctuation occurs. In another case ∂U

∂x′ ∼ 0(ε2), u ∼ 0(ε2),
ε2∂x′ ∼ 0( 1
ε2 )

∂x′ ∼ 0(1), and ∂U

showing that there is excess rate of shear strain in the ﬁeld. This will lead to

instability in the ﬂow ﬁeld. So the case should be excluded. Then in the third

case ∂U

∂x′ ∼ 0(ε) only, and ∂U

ε2∂x′ ∼ 0( 1

ε ) with ﬂuctuation u ∼ 0(ε). So there is

notable ﬂuctuation in order of magnitude u ∼ 0(ε) in turbulence provided that

there exists an interior point (or set of interior points) in a monad at which

∂U
∂x′ ∼ 0(ε).

4 Conservation Equations

In ﬂuid mechanics generally a small volume ∆x1∆x2∆x3 is taken and the

ﬂux of conservative physical quantity through the boundary planes of the vol-

ume is computed. Then let ∆x1 → 0, ∆x2 → 0, ∆x3 → 0, the small volume

will tend to the point (x1, x2, x3). Thus the conservation equations at the

point (x1, x2, x3) are obtained. The boundary planes of the small volume are

absolute planes having no thickness. However in the nonstandard case a small

volume is still taken. By Use of the same method as in the standard case but

let St∆x1 → 0, St∆x2 → 0, St∆x3 → 0, the small volume ∆x1∆x2∆x3 will

tend to the monad of (x1, x2, x3). Now the boundary planes of the small vol-

ume are not absolute planes but very thin layers with thickness of ε (the linear

dimension of the monad). Also the conservation equations at this monad are

obtained. Surely the equations are ones of mean quantities over the monad in

which inﬁnite interior points are contained.

Now these conservation equations are given in the following.

13

Let “ ∼ ” express the average operation over (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′), “ ∼i ” over x′
i,

“ − ” over t′, etc., in a monad.

5 Fundamental Equations of Turbulent Flows

Before derivation of the fundamental equations of turbulent ﬂows it is

necessary to present the assumption of close property between two monads

when they are inﬁnitely close to each other and analyze the mutual relation of

the two monads in motion characteristics.

Assumption 6: Physical function deﬁned on the interior points of the

monads of a turbulent ﬁeld is very close between two monads in both

the value and structure of the function when these two monads are

inﬁnitely close to each other.

Consider that any physical quantity U ∼ 0(1), its ﬂuctuation u. The

mathematical expressions of this assumption are as follows:

17

(a) δu ∼ 0(ε2),

(b) δ

∼ 0(ε3)

[U(xi+∆xi, x′

i)−U(xi, x′

i)],

δtU = lim

St∆t→0

[U(t+∆t, t′)−U(t, t′)]

(20)

And the monads of

j, x′

k, t′)

(xi, xj, xk, t, x′

i, x′

j, x′

k, t′)

are taken as two inﬁnitely close monads. Still instantaneous quantities U and

P are decomposed into the mean parts and ﬂuctuant parts, such as

U =

U + u, P =

P + p,

u = 0,

p = 0

(21)

Where ∂U
ε2∂x′
i

is the rate of change or ﬁgure slope of the function U at the

e

nonstandard point x′

i, and ∂U
∂xi

is the mean value of

∂U
ε2∂x′
i

over x′

i (see(24)).

Clearly the condition (b) shows that the ﬁgure shape of the function U has

very little diﬀerence between two inﬁnitely close monads.

Assumption 6 could be called “Continuous Assumption”. It is well known

that physical quantities with a few exceptions vary usually continuously with

time and space. In the case of the standard analysis a function is deﬁned on

the standard points. It is characterized only by its value. The continuity of

a physical quantity requires only that the function representing the physical

quantity is continuous in mathematics. Otherwise in the nonstandard case a

18

point becomes a monad and a function is deﬁned on the interior points of the

monad. There exists a function-structure on the whole monad. So the function

is characterized by not only its value but also its structure on the monad. The

continuity of a physical quantity will mean that the variation of the physical

function deﬁned on the interior points of a monad in both its value and shape

of the function ﬁgure with monads is continuous. Thus there is very little

diﬀerence between two inﬁnitely close monads in both value and structure

of the physical function.

In other words, Assumption 6 is the nonstandard

expansion of the physical function continuity in the standard analysis case.

Moreover, on the other hand, Assumption 6 is reasonable and natural too,

because the environmental conditions imposed on two inﬁnitely close monads

are very close to each other.

In the mean equations (17)-(18) no especial mean-methods are assigned.

Now let us adopt the mean-method of (16) i.e.,

Equations (27)(28),(31)(32) and (33)(34) are the governing equations about

mean, instantaneous and ﬂuctuant quantities respectively. They can be called

as the fundamental equations of turbulent ﬂows.

It is found easily that these equations have the same form as that in the

going theory of turbulent ﬂows. But there are essentially diﬀerences between

the two. These diﬀerences are:

1.Diﬀerent methods to get them.

In the existing theory of turbulence

the mean equations are obtained by use of the average of the instantaneous

equations (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations). Then the mean equations are

subtracted from the instantaneous equations to get the ﬂuctuation equations.

But in this paper the mean equations will ﬁrst be given in view of the physical

conservation laws, and then by virtue of the close property assumption the

instantaneous and ﬂuctuant equations are obtained respectively.

2. The physical quantities in the equations of the existing theory, for ex-

ample velocity, pressure etc., are all functions of the standard point (~x, t),

but those in the nonstandard case are all functions of the point (~x, t, ~x′, t′),

actually functions of the nonstandard point (~x′, t′) with (~x, t) showing which

monad contains it. It is reasonable that the physical quantities are taken as

the functions of the standard point (~x, t) in laminar ﬂow, but not in turbu-

lent ﬂows, because a standard point becomes a monad in which there is an

interior structure (i.e., the monad ﬂow ﬁeld) in the case of turbulence.

In

fact there is no deﬁnition of instantaneous and ﬂuctuant quantities of a whole

22

monad, but there is the deﬁnition of instantaneous and ﬂuctuant quantities of

the interior points of the monad. So the Navier-Stokes equations in existing

meanings cease to exist in principle. Therefore, though (31)-(32) are formally

the same as the Navier-Stokes equations, they are diﬀerent. The fundamental

equations obtained in this work are governing equations about the physical

quantities deﬁned at those interior points of various monads which have the

same nonstandard coordinates (~x′, t′), but the fundamental equations in the

going turbulent theory are governing equations about the physical quantities

deﬁned at the standard points of the global ﬂow ﬁeld. There is a conceptual

diﬀerence between them.

3. The average in the existing theory means usually the ensemble average,

but the distribution function can not be given. So the closure problem contin-

ues to exist. Otherwise, it is deﬁnite in the nonstandard model to take average

over all interior points of a monad by use of the equiprobability assumption.

4.

It should be pointed out that the function values at some standard

points are given for the initial and boundary conditions of the fundamental

equations in the existing theory, but the function values only at some non-

standard points can be taken as the initial and boundary conditions of the

fundamental equations in the nonstandard case. Because a turbulent ﬁeld al-

ways starts and develops from walls or laminar ﬂows and evolves from laminar

ﬂows or static ﬂuids, the function values on walls or laminar ﬂows can be taken

as the boundary conditions and the conditions of static ﬂuids or laminar ﬂows

can be taken as the initial conditions. No slip condition is still kept. Thus the

initial and boundary conditions of the fundamental equations obtained from

the nonstandard analysis can be given in principle.

g

turbulence as composed of monad ﬁelds and by use of the close property be-

tween two inﬁnitely close monads we can give one reasonable closure method

as follows.

ui ∼ 0(ε), it follows that

By Assumption 6 δui ∼ 0(ε2) and the order of magnitude of ﬂuctuation

δ(uiuj) = uiδuj + ujδui ∼ 0(ε3)

uiuj ∼ 0(ε3)

So it is obtained that

Surely if ui = 0, p = 0, i.e., no ﬂuctuations occur, the equations (27)(28)

and (31)(32) are reduced to ordinary Navier-Stokes equations and the ﬁeld

becomes a laminar ﬁeld.

7 Some Remarks on the Numerical Calculations

To take the ∂U

∂t for example, by the deﬁnition of ∂U

∂t in this paper, it follows

that

∂U
∂t

= lim

St∆t→0

U(x1, x2, x3, t + ∆t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) − U(x1, x2, x3, t, x′
∆t

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′)

(40)

For the numerical computation the “St∆t → 0” is approximated to a ﬁnite

time increment(very small but ﬁnite) ∆t. The nature of this discretization is

that the inﬁnitesimal ε is taken as the small increment ∆t in approximation.

Surely U(x1, x2, x3, t + ∆t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) and U(x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) are the

values of the physical quantity U at the interior point (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) of two

diﬀerent monads in time, monad of (t + ∆t) and monad of (t),respectively.

Though the fundamental equations work for any interior point (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′)

of every monad, it is better that let x′

1 = x′

2 = x′

3 = t′ = 0 because the point

25

(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0) locates on the boundary of the time-space of a turbulent

ﬁeld when (x1, x2, x3, t) is the boundary monad of the ﬁeld.

Moreover U(x1, x2, x3, t + ∆t, 0, 0, 0, 0) and U(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0) are all

hyperreal numbers. In the numerical calculations their standard parts will be

taken.

Therefore after the discretization ∂U

∂t becomes:

StU(x1, x2, x3, t + ∆t, 0, 0, 0, 0) − StU(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0)
∆t

For simplicity it can also be written as

U(x1, x2, x3, t + ∆t, 0, 0, 0, 0) − U(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0)
∆t

(41)

provided it is kept in mind that the U in (41) represent the standard parts of

them.

quantities.

There are similar discussions for the space partial derivertives of physical

After the U(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0) and u(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0), the instan-

taneous and ﬂuctuant quantities respectively, are obtained, then

U (x1, x2, x3, t) = U(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0) − u(x1, x2, x3, t, 0, 0, 0, 0)

(42)

e

That is the mean value over the point (x1, x2, x3, t), strictly speaking, over the

small volume of ∆x1∆x2∆x3∆t.

Moreover, the mean value

U obtained by the method described above is

still random oscillatory. The random oscillations of the mean values

e

U stem

from the unavoidable random disturbances in real turbulent ﬁelds.

e

If the

average of these mean values over a ﬁnite time period(or a ﬁnite space range)

26

is taken once again, the average results could be compared with the measured

average values of physical quantities over corresponding time period(or space

range).

8 Conclusion

In view of the concepts of the nonstandard analysis and the fact that

the physical world has a hierarchical structure one nonstandard picture on

turbulent ﬂows is presented in this paper. The key points of this picture are

as follows:

1. There exist two kinds of ﬁelds in diﬀerent levels. One of them is the

global turbulent ﬁeld composed of the standard points (monads), and the other

is the monad ﬁeld. And a monad on the whole is not already uniform. Now

the interior structure occurs in a monad, namely, diﬀerent interior points of

the monad possess diﬀerent characteristics of motion.

2. The ﬂows in a monad ﬁeld are laminar and governed by the ordinary

equations of laminar ﬂows.

3. If there are two kinds of ﬁelds in diﬀerent levels one operation of mea-

surement at any point (actually a monad) of the ﬁeld in a higher level will

act randomly on one interior point of the monad ﬁeld. The measurer can not

determine which interior point of the monad but only the whole monad on

which the measurement operation acts.

The position of measured object can not be determined exactly, but over a

range. Evidently there exists some uncertainty of measurement. That uncer-

tainty stems from the hierarchical structure of the physical phenomena under

description and observation.

27

4. The ﬂows in a turbulent ﬁeld are also continuous and regular. The dis-

order, irregularity and ﬂuctuation that seem intuitively to be in the turbulence

occur because of the uncertainty of measurement. Hence we can probably say

that the disorder of turbulence stems from two sources. The ﬁrst is the ﬂuctu-

ation because of the uncertainty of measurement. This kind of ﬂuctuation is

thought to be “true turbulent ﬂuctuation”. The second is the violent unsteadi-

ness and unhomogeneity of the ﬁeld. The values of

Ui and

P vary fast with

time and space. This feature of turbulence is due to the ﬂow-instability as the

f

e

Reynolds number is very high. In the case, the small random disturbances will

be ampliﬁed.

5. There are two kinds of averages. The values of the measurement acting

on one interior point of a monad will show merely the mean results over a lot of

ﬂuid molecules contained in this interior point. The second is the average over

all interior points in a monad. The average results indicate the mean values

of the physical quantities over the monad (the standard point) in the global

ﬁeld. By the equiprobability assumption the mean formula of the second can

be given in (22).

6. As the expansion of the fact that the physical functions are continuous in

the standard case the assumption of close property between two inﬁnitely close

monads shows that the variation of not only values but also interior structure

of the physical function U(~x, t, ~x′, t′) with (~x, t) (monad) is continuous too. In

other words, there exists only very little diﬀerence in characteristics between

two inﬁnitely close monads. According to this assumption and the conservation

laws the governing equations of mean, instantaneous and ﬂuctuant quantities in

turbulence (i.e., the fundamental equations) are obtained, and one reasonable

28

closure method is given too.

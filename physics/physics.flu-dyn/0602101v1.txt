Abstract

We report the results of experiments that examined the dependence of the dripping dynamics of a

leaky faucet on the oriﬁce diameter. The transition of the dripping frequency between periodic and

chaotic states was found to depend on the oriﬁce diameter. We suggest a theoretical explanation for

these transitions based on drop formation time scales. In addition, short-range anti-correlations

were measured in the chaotic region. These too showed a dependence on the faucet diameter.

Finally, a comparison was done between the experimental results with a one-dimensional model for

drop formation. Quantitative agreement was found between the simulations and the experimental

results.

INTRODUCTION

The dripping faucet is an everyday physical system that exhibits rich dynamical behavior.

In particular it shows period doubling, strange attractors, and transitions between numerous

periodic phases[1]. The leaky faucet system covers a wide range of interest, from free surface

ﬂuid singularities (drop formation)[2] to chaotic (dripping) dynamics[1, 3].

Drop formation is an ancient problem[4]. Plateau[5] was the ﬁrst to point the importance

of surface tension in generating the instability leading to drop break-up. However a full

description of drop formation was not available until the end of the last decade, where the

use of computer models simulated the formation of single drops[2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The chaotic nature of the dripping faucet was ﬁrst considered by R¨ossler[3]. His basic

prediction concerning the behavior of a leaky faucet as a chaotic system was conﬁrmed

experimentally by Shaw[1, 12]. Yet the dripping dynamics of the leaky faucet still lacks a

quantitative theoretical description. There are two complementing theoretical approaches

that describe dripping in a leaky faucet. The ﬁrst is Shaw’s mass-on-spring model[1] or

similar models[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], which give the basic characteristics of the dynamics

of a leaky faucet. However, a full quantitative description of the system can not be deduced

from such a model. The other approach is based on solving an approximate one-dimensional

form of the Navier-Stokes equations of the system[2, 6, 7, 8], or a similar one-dimensional

Langrangian based ﬂuid mechanical equations of motion[9, 10]. The use of an approximate

one-dimensional model is necessary due to the extensive consumption of computer time using

the full two-dimensional model. However, it yields a relatively good approximate solution

for drop formation[2], and also agrees qualitatively with the experimental measurements of

the dripping dynamics. Yet several problems still remain using the one-dimensional model

as will be outlined below.

The lack of a quantitative description of the dripping dynamics can be pinpointed into

several basic questions. One of the main questions is the cause for the chaotic behavior of

a leaky faucet, which is not yet clear. Shaw’s model[1] induces an unstable dripping state

via the increasing inﬂuence of the vibrations of the drop (as the ﬂow rate increases) on

the dripping dynamics during drop formation. These vibrations are due to the act of the

restoring surface tension. On the other hand the coupling between oscillations of the residue

due to recoil and drop build-up[9] is another interesting option.

2

Most of the experiments in this ﬁeld focus on measuring the time intervals between

successive drops (dripping frequency). The dripping frequency is measured as a function of

the ﬂow rate[1]. Beside the obvious choice of ﬂow rate, there are several possible control

parameters on the dripping dynamics such as the diameter and shape of the faucet oriﬁce,

the surface tension and the viscosity of the ﬂuid[19]. However the exact dependence of

the dripping dynamics on these parameters has not yet been determined. An exception is

temperature. The dependence of the dripping dynamics on temperature was measured and

quantiﬁed[21] (see below).

In the present work we focused on the dependence of the dripping dynamics on the oriﬁce

diameter. We focused on the dependence of the transition frequency between chaotic and

periodic states on the pipette diameter. Note that the size of the pending drop depends

on the oriﬁce diameter. Thus the dripping frequency and dynamics are determined also by

the size of the oriﬁce. In addition we compared our experimental results with numerical

simulations based on the one-dimensional ﬂuid-mechanical model described by Fuchikami et

II. ASPECTS OF FAUCET DYNAMICS

The main aspects of the leaky faucet system relevant to our experiments are outlined

al.[10].

below:

A. Drop Formation

Drop formation can be separated into three main stages[9]:
1. Build up time, during which the drop is formed: τf ∼ R

v0 , where R is the oriﬁce radius,

and v0 is the ﬂuid velocity.

2. Critical time (criticality), where the drop breaks-oﬀ the ﬂuid column: τn ∼ q

R3ρ
Γ ,

where ρ is the ﬂuid’s density, and Γ is the surface tension.

3. Recoil time of the residual mass after break-up: τd ∼ V

η√32πΓ, where η is the viscosity,

7
12

and V is the residual volume.

This separation is not strict - for instance, the recoil and the build-up stages overlap.

3

The dripping dynamics is inﬂuenced by many parameters. The most relevant ones from

our experimental point of view are outlined below:

The evolution of the drop’s volume prior to break-up is approximately linear with time. It

incorporates a small oscillatory term, at least up to dripping rates as high as 10 drops/sec[20].

Note that the volume grows linearly even at criticality.

Also, at the periodic state the drop volume was shown to be approximately constant at a

ﬁxed ﬂow rate[21]. At this state it was claimed that the volume of the drop increased while

increasing the ﬂow rate[21].

2. Faucet Diameter

It has been shown qualitatively that the dripping dynamics depend on the diameter d

and thickness of the oriﬁce for relatively small pipettes (d ≤ 4mm) [22]. Note that in

our experiment all the pipettes have a diameter that is less than 4.5mm. The oriﬁce wall

thickness is especially important for thin faucets in which the ratio between the oriﬁce wall

and the inner pipette radius is less than 0.2[22]. For instance, in these thin faucets satellite

drop formation was reduced considerably compared to thicker faucets[22]. However, the

exact dependence of the dripping dynamics on the oriﬁce diameter is not yet clear. In our

experiments the ratio between the oriﬁce wall and the inner pipette diameter was always

larger than 0.4, thus we expect that this factor will not inﬂuence our results. Note also that

in the following the term faucet diameter refers to the inner pipette diameter.

3. Faucet Geometry

The oriﬁce geometry has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on dripping, as shown by various

experiments[22, 23, 24, 25]. For instance, increasing the asymmetry of the oriﬁce (cut

angle) yielded a more stable dripping sequence. Increasing the faucet’s inclination softened

the transition between one chaotic state to another, from a drastic one (boundary crisis)

4

to a smoother one[25]. In our experiments all the faucets had a single straight (cut angle)

shape.

4. Temperature

Temperature changes inﬂuence the dripping dynamics, resulting in an approximate linear
4dT [ml/Ksec],

dependence between the eﬀective ﬂow rate and temperature: dQ ∼ 4 × 10−

for 288K < T < 303K[21]. Note that the measured ﬂow rate does not change due to

temperature changes, but lowering the temperature results in a shift of the characteristic

dripping patterns to higher ﬂow rates[26].

5. Periodic Perturbations

The possibility of controlling the dripping dynamics by introducing external perturbations

was examined for the leaky faucet[27, 28]. A periodic perturbation applied to the leaky faucet

changed the dripping dynamics from a stable to a chaotic state[27]. Theoretical analysis

of the mass-on-spring model combined with ﬂuid-mechanical numerical simulations showed

that a periodic perturbation induces discontinuous transitions between chaotic and periodic

dripping states[28]. However the exact dependence of the dripping dynamics on external

periodic perturbations is not yet clear, and deserves further examination.

C. Transitions between Chaotic and Periodic States

1. Theoretical Model

The transition between stable (periodic) and chaotic states can be attributed to various

mechanisms[29]. Recently there has been an attempt to explain the origin of such transi-

tions for dripping dynamics[19]. The suggested model connects between the transition from

dripping to jetting to the transition from a periodic to a chaotic state[19]. However this

model is mostly relevant to viscous ﬂuids, which is not the case in our experiments.

5

2. Transitions at High Flow Rates

A transition from a chaotic to a stable state at high dripping rates was one of the initial

observations done for the leaky faucet[30, 31, 32]. It was claimed that such a transition is a

result of an inverse Hopf bifurcation near continuous ﬂow (f ≤ 40Hz)[30, 31, 32].

D. The Reliability of One-Dimensional Simulations of Drop Formation

The comparison between theory and experiment with respect to dripping dynamics is

mostly done with the aid of one-dimensional simulations. A comparison between the more re-

alistic two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations and the approximate one-dimensional

model revealed several problems with the approximate equations[11]. Mainly, the model

can not account for the faucet thickness, which inﬂuences drop formation[11], mostly for low

viscous ﬂuids under high ﬂow rates.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

The simulation is based on a one-dimensional Lagrangian description of the ﬂuid motion.

It aims at reconstructing drop formation for a ﬂuid column stretching from an oriﬁce. The

algorithm was ﬁrst introduced by Fuchikami et al.[10]. Brieﬂy, an initial drop is decomposed

into many thin disks for which separate equations of motion are written and solved. These

equations are obtained from the Lagrangian equation under the inﬂuence of gravity, surface

tension and viscosity.

The major assumptions incorporated in the model are:

1. The ﬂuid is incompressible.

2. The drop is axisymmetric.

the vertical one.

3. The horizontal component of the ﬂuid velocity can be neglected in comparison with

4. The vertical component of the velocity depends only on the vertical coordinate.

5. There is no exchange of ﬂuid between diﬀerent discs.

6

The Lagrangian of the system is:

L = Ekin − Ug − UΓ

(1)

(2)

Where Ekin is the kinetic energy, Ug is the gravitational energy, and UΓ is the surface

tension, as deﬁned in reference no.

[10]. The resulting Lagrangian equation of motion for

the each disc is:

d
dt

∂L
∂ ˙zj

=

∂L
∂zj

+

1
2

∂ ˙Ekin
∂ ˙zj

Where zj is the coordinate of disc j, and ˙X represent the time derivative of X. By

integrating Eq. 2 we obtain the evolution of the drop in time and space. The integration

was done using the 5’th order Runge-Kutta method[33]. After integration, the width of each

disc was checked. If the width of some disc (termed the ”singular disc”) is less than a critical

value (i.e. 0.01mm), than a drop is broken oﬀ, and the simulation restarts without the discs

below the singular disc. Thus it is possible to calculate the time duration of drop formation

from the starting point until break-oﬀ at a speciﬁc ﬂow rate, and therefore to compare it

with the experimental results.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL

Our experimental setup consisted of a primary water tank, connected to a laminar tube

which was connected at its other end to a pipette through which water dripped. The laminar

tube was used to stabilize the water ﬂow. Drops falling from the pipette interrupted a laser

beam directed at a photodiode sensor. The interruption caused a signiﬁcant decrease of the

sensor’s voltage, which was continuously recorded as a function of time by a computer. The

recorded data was used to calculate the time diﬀerence between consecutive drops. The

sensor’s resolution was 100,000 scans per second. A schematic drawing of the experimental

setup is shown in ﬁgure 1. In addition we used a stroboscope with a CCD camera in order

to image drop formation in the periodic state.

7

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The time intervals between consecutive drops were measured while continuously changing

the ﬂow rate. The ﬂow rate was measured directly by ﬁlling for 30 seconds the funnel, and

then weighing it. At the same time the water level (height) in the tank was measured.

This procedure was repeated every 5 minutes for the entire experiment - until the tank was

emptied. Poiseuille’s law[34] describes the ﬂow rate through a tube under a given pressure

diﬀerence:

Q =

∆P πr2
8lη

(3)

Where Q is the ﬂow rate, r is the tube (faucet) radius through which the ﬂuid ﬂows, ∆P is

the pressure diﬀerence along the tube, and l the faucet’s length. Since Q ∝ dh

dt , and ∆P ∝ h
where h is the water level inside the tank, the ﬂow rate is expected to decrease exponentially.

Such a decay was measured. Then after an exponential ﬁt based on Poiseuille’s law was

made to the measured ﬂow rate as a function of time. The result was used to calibrate our

experiments - given an initial water level it was then possible to calculate the exact ﬂow

rate from the recorded time that has elapsed since the beginning of the experiment. Note

that the calibration was done for each faucet separately since the ﬂow rate depends on the

faucet diameter.

The resulting measurement of inter-drop time interval as a function of ﬂow rate is shown in

ﬁgure 2. Such measurements have been done for several diﬀerent faucets, each with a speciﬁc

oriﬁce diameter. The diameters d of the pipettes ranged between 0.9mm ≤ d ≤ 4.4mm.

Deﬁning ∆T as the inter-drop time diﬀerence, it is possible to distinguish between three

major regions in ﬁgure 2. First a low frequency region for which ∆T > 120msec , where

the dripping period is quasi-stable. This state is roughly stable, interrupted occasionally

by repeated structures of unstable states[23]. A chaotic region is seen for 50msec < ∆T <

120msec where there is a broad distribution of points and occasionally a periodic window

with several speciﬁc dripping frequencies. Finally, a high frequency state for ∆T < 50msec

, where a periodic state was measured for d ≥ 2.3mm pipette diameters.

A quantitative comparison between the diﬀerent dripping regions was done by calculating

the normalized average deviation from the mean time interval between consecutive drops

(SD):

8

SD(∆T ) =

2

q∆T 2 − ∆T
∆T

(4)

where ∆T and ∆T 2 are the average values of ∆T and ∆T 2 for 1000 consecutive drops.

Note that changing the number of drops over which the average is made does not change
the resulting SD. Also, over 1000 drops the maximal ﬂow rate change is 0.01 ml

sec, which is

of the same order of magnitude as the error of the measured ﬂow rate.

The results of these calculations for an experiment using a 4.4mm and a 2.3mm diameter

pipettes are shown in ﬁgure 3. For clarity we deﬁne a chaotic region as one in which

SD > 0.05.

Similar to the raw data measurements shown in ﬁgure 2, ﬁgure 3 also shows three

main distinguishable regions: a stable area for ∆T ≤ 50msec ,a chaotic area between

50msec ≤ ∆T ≤ 120msec, and another stable region for ∆T ≥ 120msec. Note that there

is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the transition frequency from a stable to a chaotic state be-

tween the diﬀerent faucet measurements. This diﬀerence also exists for the transition from

a chaotic to a periodic state at high ﬂow rates.

A. Dripping Dependence on Oriﬁce Diameter

In order to examine the dependence of the dripping dynamics on the oriﬁce diameter

we repeated the SD calculations for diﬀerent pipettes. Then we extracted the ﬂow rate

at which a transition between chaotic and periodic dripping takes place. Figure 4 shows

the dependence of the transition frequency on the pipette diameter d. As seen in ﬁgure

4 decreasing the oriﬁce diameter increases the transition frequency from a periodic to a

chaotic state. As noted above, for relatively large oriﬁces (d ≥ 2.3mm) there is a transition

into a high frequency stable state from a chaotic state. As seen in the inset of ﬁgure 4,

this transition is also diameter dependent:

increasing the oriﬁce diameter decreases the

critical dripping frequency at which the transition occurs. It should be noted that all the

experiments were repeated several times under diﬀerent temperatures for each faucet. Note

also that the overall change in temperature between diﬀerent experiments was no more

than 10K. The resulting diﬀerence in the eﬀective ﬂow rate[21] is much less than the one

measured between diﬀerent pipette experiments. Therefore this change gives a lower limit

on the error bars of the measured transition frequencies. Thus, temperature and possible

9

external periodic noise can not account for the changes in the transition frequencies, and it

is concluded that these changes are due to the diﬀerence in the faucet diameter.

B. Anti-correlation Measurements

Correlations between inter-drop time intervals have been measured for the leaky faucet

system[35]. These correlations were claimed to be non-Gaussian and long-ranged[35].

In order to quantify such correlations we deﬁne a correlation function:

C(n) =

{dtm − hdti}{dtn+m − hdti}

(5)

1

1000 X
m

where dtn is the time diﬀerence between n consecutive drops, the brackets hXi denote the

average value of X (for 1000 consecutive drops), and the sum is over m = 1000 consecutive

drops. Note that in C(n) small n(< 5)represents short-range correlations, while large n(>

10) represents long-range correlations. Also, correlations are signiﬁed by low values while

anti-correlations are emphasized by (absolute large) negative values.

We focused on calculating short-range correlations. The calculations were done for dif-

ferent faucets. A typical calculation of short-range correlations C(1) is shown in ﬁgure 5

for a 4.4mm diameter faucet. As shown in the ﬁgure, near the stable/chaotic transitions

(∆T ∼ 50msec and 110msec) there are strong correlations emphasized by the relatively low

value of the correlation function. However, in the center of the chaotic area there are short-

range anti-correlations were the correlation function gains a large (absolute) negative value.

Moreover, these short-range anti-correlations also depend on the faucet oriﬁce. As can be

clearly seen in ﬁgure 6, the dripping frequency at which C(1) is maximal increases while

decreasing the oriﬁce diameter. In order to emphasize this point we shifted the correlation

function calculations of diﬀerent faucets on a time scale t equal to t = (2.6 − d) · 8, where d

is the faucet diameter in millimeters. The result is shown in ﬁgure 7, where it can be clearly

seen that all measurements collapse into a roughly approximate single curve. However this

shifting gives only a qualitative picture since the estimated errors on the shift are large.

10

C. Dripping Imaging

Several images of drop formation were taken with the aid of a stroboscope and a CCD

camera. The resulting images, done using a 4.4mm pipette diameter at the periodic state,

showed that the volume of the drop is approximately constant at this state. In addition, the

images showed that the drop volume decreases while increasing the ﬂow rate, contrary to the

claim in the literature[21]. In order to address this question quantitatively, we measured the

average drop mass as a function of the ﬂow rate for diﬀerent experiments. The measurements

were done by ﬁlling the funnel with drops for 30 seconds during which the ﬂow rate did not

change considerably. Then the water in the funnel was weighed. At the same time using the

computer record of the photo-diode sensor, the number of drops falling from the oriﬁce was

counted. Dividing the ﬂuid mass by the number of drops yielded the average drop mass.

This procedure was repeated at a period of 5 minutes between each collection for an entire

experiment. The result of these measurements is shown in ﬁgure 8. As can be clearly seen

the average drop mass decreases while increasing the ﬂow rate.

D. Numerical Simulation Results

Numerical simulations were made for a 4.4mm diameter faucet. The resulting inter-drop

time diﬀerence for diﬀerent ﬂow rates was used to calculate both SD and anti-correlations.

The SD calculations for both simulations and measurements are shown in ﬁgure 9. The

comparison between experiment and simulation is relatively good for most dripping rates.

The comparison between short range anti-correlations drawn from simulations and mea-

surements is shown in ﬁgure 5. Again, the agreement between theory and experiment is

relatively good. Hence the approximations made in the numerical simulations have proven

to hold also for low viscous ﬂuids.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The dependence of the dripping dynamics on the oriﬁce diameter was examined. We

found that the system is driven to a chaotic state at a lower dripping frequency for larger

faucets. Such a dependence of the transition frequency on the faucet diameter can be

explained using a time-scale model for the transition between stable and chaotic states.

11

Speciﬁcally, we require that in the chaotic state the ratio between the recoil time τd and the

drop build-up time τf should be greater than 1. The transition frequency from a stable to

chaotic state is set to the dripping frequency in which both times equalize:
that the dripping frequency f is deﬁned as: f = 1

. The transition frequency dependence

= 1 . Note

τd
τf

τf +τn

on faucet diameter stems from the fact that the above ratio depends on it. The result is

shown in ﬁgure 10. The theoretical transition frequency decreases while increasing the faucet

diameter, roughly consistent with the experimental results that are also shown in the graph.

In addition, we found that the high frequency transition from a chaotic to a periodic

state is also faucet (diameter) dependent, where increasing the faucet diameter decreases the

transition frequency. Again, we suggest a theoretical explanation for such a transition. Our

hypothesis is based on the assumption that when the break-up time τn equals the drop build-

up time τf , the dripping dynamics stabilize. This is due to the fact that above this dripping

frequency the important (larger) time scale is the break-up time τn, which is constant for

a given faucet. Therefore above this time scale τn > τf the system is in a periodic state.

The results are shown in ﬁgure 10. Although in this case the agreement between theory and

experiment is only partial, it is still signiﬁcant. This is due to the fact that the tendency

of the transition frequency to decrease while increasing the faucet diameter is the same

for both experimental results and theoretical predictions. Thus our results indicate that

the transition between chaotic and periodic states is due to the interaction between drop

formation and recoil, and possibly also to the critical state.

Finally, we measured short-time anti-correlations in the dripping faucet experiment inside

the chaotic state. These too were shown to depend on the oriﬁce diameter. We stress that

these measurements strengthen the connection that has been drawn above between faucet

diameter and dripping dynamics. This is emphasized by the fact that the shape of the

(short-range) correlation curve shifts towards higher dripping frequencies while decreasing

the faucet diameter. This shift represents also a similar shift of the transition frequencies

between chaotic and periodic dripping, probed by a totally diﬀerent method.

We also compared both short-range correlations and SD calculations with numerical sim-

ulations. The comparison showed roughly good agreement between theory and experiments,

emphasizing the strength of the one-dimensional simulations in giving a partial quantitative

description of dripping dynamics.

state (high frequencies) on the oriﬁce diameter.

FIG. 5: The short-range correlation function C(m=1) calculated for a 4.4mm diameter faucet. The

solid circles represent calculations based on experimental measurements. The hollow squares rep-

resent calculations based on the numerical simulations of drop formation using the one dimensional

model.

FIG. 6: Measurements of the short-range correlation function C(m=1) for various faucets. The

measurements were shifted by a constant value (in the y-axis) for clarity. The hollow squares

represent data for 4.4mm diameter faucet, the solid squares for 2.6mm, the hollow diamonds

for 2.3mm, the solid diamonds for 2.0mm, the hollow triangles for 1.9mm, the solid triangles

for 1.4mm, and the hollow circles for 0.9mm diameter faucet. Note that no short range anti-

correlations were measured for the 0.9mm diameter faucet.

FIG. 7: Measurements of the short-range correlation function C(m=1) for various faucets. The

measurements are shifted linearly as described in the text. The symbols represent measurements

of diﬀerent faucets, as described in the caption of Fig. 8. Note that all measurements merge into

an approximate single curve.

imental results for a 4.4mm diameter faucet (solid squares) and for the one-dimensional model

(hollow circles).

FIG. 10: Comparison between measured and estimated dripping frequency transitions. The squares

refer to a transition from a chaotic to a periodic state, and the circles to a transition from a stable

to a chaotic state. The solid symbols represent theoretical estimations which are explained in the

text. The hollow symbols represent measurements. Note that a transition to a high-frequency

stable state was not measured for small diameter (d < 2.0mm) faucets. Note also that all error

bars are included inside the symbols size.

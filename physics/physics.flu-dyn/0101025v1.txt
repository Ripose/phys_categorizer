Global stability of systems related to the Navier-Stokes
equations

Abstract

A generalized Lyapunov method is outlined which
predicts global stability of a broad class of dissipa-
tive dynamical systems. The method is applied to
the complex Lorenz model and to the Navier-Stokes
equations. In both cases one ﬁnds compact domains
in phase space which contain the ω sets of all tra-
jectories, in particular the ﬁxed points, limit cycles,
and strange attractors.

1 Introduction

In the theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations, the
method of Lyapunov function in general serves to
examine the stability of a ﬁxed point and its do-
main of attraction, for an overview see e.g.
[1].
The method can be naturally extended to the case
where, instead of a ﬁxed point, one is interested in
the stability of a compact domain which has ﬁnite
measure in phase space and is invariant under the
ﬂow.

In this contribution we essentially illustrate the
power of generalized Lyapunov functions, which are
not discussed in the standard textbooks on dynam-
ical systems theory. In particular we are interested
in ﬁnding globally attractive domains for a certain
class of nonlinear models. The corresponding sys-
tems turn out to be globally stable in the sense that
no trajectory which starts within a certain domain
can leave it and the trajectories which start outside
of the domain will end in it after suﬃciently large
times. The method presented cannot give details
on the nature of the attractors contained within an
attractive domain. Furthermore, we will only par-

tially succeed to determine minimal attractive do-
mains. This, on the other hand, opens the chance
of ﬁnding attractive domains in an analytical way.
As a matter of fact, in his famous paper, Lorenz
showed [2] that (nonminimal) attractive domains
can be found in an elementary way by linear meth-
ods provided the nonlinearities of the dissipative
dynamical system are quadratic only and do not
contribute to the overall energy balance.

In the next section the method of generalized
Lyapunov functions will be introduced together
with a class of dynamical systems as proposed by
Lorenz [2], which allow for quadratic Lyapunov
functions. As a ﬁrst example, the method is ap-
plied to the real Lorenz model according to [3]. We
discuss then in the third section a more detailed ap-
plication to the ﬁve-dimensional or complex Lorenz
model [4]. As compared with recent work [5] where
the attractive domain has been successfully mini-
mized to some extent for parameter values relevant
in infra-red laser physics, further new results [7] are
presented here. In the last section the generalized
Lyapunov method serves to prove the boundedness
of the velocity ﬁeld of the incompressible Navier-
Stokes equations. This is a known result and was
shown in diﬀerent ways elsewhere, for the case of
periodic boundary conditions see e.g. section 5.3 in
[8].

2 Generalized Lyapunov func-

Let us consider an autonomous dynamical system

f : Rn → Rn

where the vector ﬁeld f is supposed to be suﬃ-
ciently smooth. Be L(x) a positively deﬁnite, suﬃ-
ciently smooth, scalar function with L(0) = 0 and
L(x) > 0 for x 6= 0. Furthermore, be G a domain
which contains the point x = 0, and ¯G its com-
plement. Then we call L a generalized Lyapunov
function, if the following properties hold for a com-
pact domain G

L(x) > 0

for

x 6= 0

L(0) = 0

for x ∈ ¯G,
gradx L(x) 6= 0 for x 6= 0,
and Lipschitz continuous.

(4)

The manifolds L(x) = C = constant are closed
hypersurfaces, which surround the point x = 0 and
foliate the phase space. To see this, one starts with
a suﬃciently small constant C which because of
L(x) > 0 is connected with an ellipsoidal surface.
Then one constructs the one-dimensional curves
normal to the surfaces L(x) = C. If λ is a suitable
curve parameter, the curves x(λ) with x : R → Rn
can be deﬁned through the property that the curve
tangents are parallel to the surface normal in every
point. We can thus consider the curves as trajecto-
ries of the following dynamical system

dxi
dλ

=

∂L(x(λ))
∂xi

,

i = 1, 2, ...n.

(5)

Since this system is autonomous and because of (4),
we obtain unique curves x(λ, x0) which do not in-
tersect or touch each other; x0 ∈ Rn is an arbitrary
initial point which can be chosen, for instance, on
an ellipsoid close to the origin. In this way we have
constructed a 1-1 map between the points of an ar-
bitrary surface L = C and the points of an ellip-
soid close to the origin x = 0. In other words, the
surfaces L = C are homeomorph to an ellipsoid sur-
rounding x = 0. Moreover, any surface with a given
constant C0 separates the phase space into an in-
ner part which contains x = 0 and an outer part
foliated by the surfaces C > C0.

At the boundary of G we have points where
dL/dt = 0. We remark that this set contains

the critical points of the system where f (x) = 0,
because dL/dt = Σifi∂L/∂xi = 0. The surface
L = C ∗ which both bounds a domain containing
the points with dL/dt = 0 and is minimal with
respect to C, is called the critical one. Now we
are ready to draw conclusions for the trajectories of
the system (1). If x0 is the initial point of a tra-
jectory with the property L(x0) = C0 > C ∗, then
because of (3) we have dL(x0)/dt < 0. Therefore
the trajectory wanders towards inner points with
smaller C until the critical surface with L(x) = C ∗
is reached. This tells that the critical surface is
attractive from the outside. Simultaneously there
can be no escape of a trajectory which starts inside
the domain bounded by the critical surface. For
illustration see Fig.1. The existence of a general-
ized Lyapunov function guarantees therefore that
the trajectories of the dynamical system asymptot-
ically are conﬁned to the domain G∗ bounded by
the critical surface. Clearly, if we ﬁnd several Lya-
punov functions with attractive domains G∗
2, ..,
then the intersection G∗ = ∩iG∗
i contains the mini-
mal attractive domain.

dL/dt = 0, which is tangent to the critical sur-
face L = C ∗ (dot-dashed). The latter conﬁnes a
domain of attraction. The solid curves refer to sur-
faces L = C with C > C ∗ and dL/dt < 0.

As a rather general example Lorenz considered

the following dynamical system, for i = 1, . . . n,

which gives rise to

Now, because the symmetric part of the matrix bij
is positively deﬁnite (all eigenvalues are positive),
dL/dt < 0 for suﬃciently large |x|. Therefore L ful-
ﬁls all conditions (2)-(4) of a generalized Lyapunov
function.

As an elementary example we consider the Lorenz

model [2]

˙x = σ(y − x);

˙y = −xz + rx − y;

˙z = xy − bz
(10)
with r, σ, b > 0. Sparrow, see Appendix C in [3],
proved the boundedness of this model with the aid
of the following function

˜L = rx2 + σy2 + σ(z − 2r)2.

(11)

After the coordinate shift x1 := x, x2 := y, x3 :=
z − 2r, we obtain

L(x) := rx2

2 + x2

which is negatively deﬁnite for suﬃciently large dis-
tances

(12) fulﬁls the conditions of a generalized Lyapunov
function with the implication that a bounded do-
main exists which attracts all trajectories.

Lorenz model

The complex Lorenz model reads in standard form
[4]

˙Y = −aY + rX − XZ

(14)

˙Z = −bZ +

(X ∗Y + XY ∗)

where X, Y and Z are complex variables and real,
respectively. Furthermore, a = 1 − ie, r = r1 + ir2
with real parameters e, r1, r2, σ, and b. In the case
of modeling a detuned laser, the constants r1, r2 are
related to the pumping rate and to the detuning, re-
spectively. Furthermore σ = κ/γ⊥ and b = γk/γ⊥
where κ, γ⊥, γk denote the relaxation constants of
the cavity, of the polarization, and of the inversion.
The variable X is proportional to the complex elec-
tric ﬁeld amplitude, Y is a linear combination of
electric ﬁeld and polarization, which are both com-
plex, while Z is related to the so-called population
inversion, for details see e.g. [9]. As is well known
[4], this model has nontrivial stationary solutions
only in the so-called laser case with the parameter
constraint e = −r2.

It is convenient to introduce real variables xi,
with i = 1, ..., 5, by X = x1 + ix2, Y = x3 + ix4
and Z = x5. The real version of (14) then reads

˙x1 = −σx1 + σx3
˙x2 = −σx2 + σx4
˙x3 = r1x1 − x3 − r2x2 − ex4 − x1x5
˙x4 = r1x2 − x4 + r2x1 + ex3 − x2x5
˙x5 = −bx5 + x1x3 + x2x4.

In [5] the following Lyapunov function was pro-

Lorenz model is bounded for all parameters, with
and without the laser condition e = −r2 [5].

For quantitative results one determines the el-
lipsoid L = C ∗ which touches the (geometrically
diﬀerent) ellipsoid dL/dt = 0 from the outside.
This amounts to a ﬁve-dimensional secular problem
which in the given case happens to be feasible ana-
lytically. The attractive domain is then minimized
with respect to the parameter D with due attention
paid to the constraint (18). Details can be found in
[5]. Numerical evaluations for physically relevant
parameters give upper bounds for the laser electric
ﬁeld which exceed the maximum values reached by
asymptotic solutions of (15) by factors of between 2
and 6. In extreme cases of transient evolution, the
solutions approach within 20% of the upper bounds
predicted by the Lyapunov method, see Fig.4 and
5 in [5].

As a remark, we have examined the more general

The determination of upper bounds of the electric
ﬁeld amplitude |X|2 is carried out in a similar way
as in [5]. The main challenge consists in the task
of simplifying rather involved analytical expressions
for diﬀerent parameter regions. In a physically rel-
evant parameter domain

(22)

with b < 2 and 2σ > b, the following upper bound
is found [7] which is minimized with respect to the
two parameters D and ξ

|X|2 ≤ 4σr1

(σ + 1)2
(σ + 1)2 + (2 − b)(2σ − b)

.

(23)

It is smaller than the upper bound |X|2 ≤ 4σr1 as
found previously in [5] with one disposable param-
eter only, namely D.

in the space domain Ω which, at least in one di-
mension, has a ﬁnite diameter so that it can be
located between two parallel planes with ﬁnite dis-
tance l. Because of div(v) = 0, the density ρ0 is
constant. We are not concerned here with weak so-
lutions, which are discussed in [6], and assume that
the solutions are suﬃciently smooth. As boundary
conditions we adopt the no-slip case with v|∂Ω = 0.
In order to obtain a dynamical system of ordi-
nary diﬀerential equations, we represent the veloc-
ity ﬁeld v in terms of an orthonormalized system
Φn ∈ D(Ω), with div(Φn) = 0, n=1,2,.., where
D(Ω) denotes the space of C∞ functions with com-
pact support in Ω. We write

As a remark, the problem of possible singularities
in the solutions of the NSE are connected with the

see [6]. The generalized Lyapunov method is related
to so-called energy methods, see e.g. [10] and [11].

Abstract

Eigenfrequencies of two spherical gas bubbles interacting in an acoustic ﬁeld are dis-
cussed theoretically. In the present study, eigenfrequency is deﬁned as the frequency
of external sound for which the phase diﬀerence between a bubble’s pulsation and
the external sound is π/2. It is shown by a linear theory that a bubble interacting
with a neighboring bubble has three (or fewer) eigenfrequencies but only two nat-
ural frequencies. This result means that the bubble has a characteristic frequency
besides the natural frequencies.

It is known that radiative interaction between gas bubbles varies their natu-
ral (or resonance) frequencies, around which the bubbles indicate resonance
response. This variation in the natural frequencies has been the subject of
many studies [1–13]. In a case where two spherical gas bubbles of diﬀerent
radii interact acoustically, a bubble has two (or one) natural frequencies (see,
e.g., [2,5,6,8]).

The aim of this Letter is to show that a gas bubble interacting with a neigh-
boring bubble has an alternative characteristic frequency; we now call this
an eigenfrequency. In the present work, an eigenfrequency is deﬁned as the
frequency of an external sound (the driving frequency) for which the phase
diﬀerence between a bubble’s pulsation and the external sound becomes π/2.
It is well known that, in a single-bubble case, the phase diﬀerence between
the bubble and an external sound becomes π/2 when the driving frequency
is equal to the bubble’s natural frequency [14]. However, it is shown in this
Letter that, in a double-bubble case, the number of eigenfrequencies diﬀers
from the number of natural frequencies. This result means that the bubbles

in the latter case have a characteristic frequency that diﬀers from the natural
frequency.

First, we derive a mathematical model to use for the present investigation.
This model describes the pulsation of two coupled bubbles. Since we are inter-
ested only in the qualitative natures of the eigenfrequencies, we use a classical
theoretical model, called a coupled-oscillator or self-consistent model [10–12],
although models with greater accuracy have been proposed [4,6,7,9].

A gas bubble immersed in a liquid pulsates when a sound wave is applied.
The sound pressure at the bubble position drives the pulsation. When other
bubbles (named “bubble 2” ∼ “bubble N”, where N is the total number of
bubbles) exist near the bubble (bubble 1), the sound waves scattered by the
other bubbles also drive the pulsation of bubble 1. Namely, the driving pressure
acting on bubble 1, pd 1, is expressed as

pd 1 = pex +

ps 1j,

(1)

N

j=2
X

where pex and ps 1j are the sound pressures of the external sound ﬁeld and the
scattered wave emitted by bubble j, respectively, at the position of bubble
1. When the wavelength of the external sound wave is much larger than the
bubbles’ radii and the distances between the bubbles, pex can be considered
spatially uniform. By assuming that the sphericity of the bubbles is thoroughly
maintained and that the liquid surrounding the bubbles is incompressible, the
scattered pressure can be estimated with (see, e.g., [15])

ps 1j ≈

(R2

where ρ is the density of the liquid, r1j is the distance between the centers of
bubble 1 and bubble j, Rj is the radius of bubble j, and the over dot denotes
the time derivative.

The radial oscillation of a spherical bubble in an incompressible viscous liquid
is described by the RPNNP equation [16]:

By assuming that the time-dependent bubble radii can be represented as R1 =

mined by the sum of viscous, radiation, and thermal damping [17]; we however
use the above setting to simplify the following discussion.)

The system of equations (6) and (7) corresponds to that derived by Shima
when σ = 0, δ1 = 0, and δ2 = 0 [2], and to that by Zabolotskaya when σ = 0
[5]. This kind of system of diﬀerential equations, called the coupled-oscillator
model or self-consistent model, has been used repeatedly to analyze acoustic
properties of coupled bubbles [2,5,8,10–13], and has been proved to be a useful
model that can provide a qualitatively accurate result despite its simple form.

Let us analyze in detail the eigenfrequencies of the linear coupled system. By
assuming that the external sound pressure at the bubble position is written
in the form of pex = −Pa sin ωt, a harmonic steady-state solution of the linear
coupled system is given as

The numerator of this equation always has a nonzero value, since M2 > 0;
this result denies the existence of a case where both A1 = 0 and B1 = 0 are
true. Also, it should be noted that F 2 + G2 appearing in the denominator of
Eq. (10) always has a nonzero value. When G = 0, F is reduced to

This has a nonzero, negative value because M2L2
and M1M2 > 0. This result means that no case exists where both F = 0 and
G = 0 are true. As a consequence, Eq. (12) is reduced to

H1F + M2G = 0.

(13)

In the following, we analyze this equation.

When the damping terms in Eq. (13) are negligible (but exist), one can easily
obtain the solution for this equation. By assuming that M1 ≈ 0 and M2 ≈ 0,
one obtains

This equation can be rewritten into two independent equations:

and

Equation (14) is the same as the theoretical formula given in Refs. [2,5] to
derive the natural frequencies of a double-bubble system; namely, the eigen-
frequencies given by this equation correspond to the natural frequencies. This

and is symmetric; namely, it exchanges subscripts 1 and 2 (or 10 and 20)
in this equation to reproduce the same equation. This means that the two
bubbles have the same two natural frequencies. One of the natural frequencies
converges to ω10 and the other to ω20 for D → ∞, and the higher natural
frequency rises and the lower one falls as D decreases [2,18].

The solution of Eq. (15) given for the ﬁrst time is

ω2
1 =

ω2
20
1 − R20/D

.

(17)

This converges to ω2
20 for D → ∞, and increases as D decreases. In contrast
to Eq. (14), Eq. (15) is asymmetric (H1 6= H2); namely, this serves to break
the symmetry of the natural frequency mentioned above. The eigenfrequency
given by Eq. (17) is not the natural frequency because it cannot be given
by the natural frequency analysis performed in Refs. [2,5]. (Even the other
models used in, e.g., [6,8] give only two natural frequencies.)

The results given above show that, when the damping eﬀect is negligible and
the radii of bubbles are not equivalent, the bubbles have three asymmetric
eigenfrequencies; one of these, for D → ∞, converges to the partial natu-
ral frequency of a corresponding bubble, while the remaining two converge
to that of a neighboring bubble. (In the following, the former eigenfrequency
is called fundamental eigenfrequency (FEF), and the latter two are called
sub-eigenfrequencies (SEFs).) One of the SEFs always increases as bubbles
approach each other. The other SEF decreases (increases) and the FEF in-
creases (decreases) when the partial natural frequency of the bubble is higher
(lower) than that of the neighboring bubble.

Figure 1 shows the eigenfrequencies for µ ≈ 0 as a function of l = D/(R10 +
R20). Other parameters are set to ρ = 1000 kg/m3, P0 = 1 atm, σ = 0.0728
N/m, and κ = 1.4. Equations (16) and (17) are used in plotting those graphs.
The radius of bubble 1 is ﬁxed to 10 µm and that of bubble 2 varies from
5 µm to 10 µm. As discussed above, three eigenfrequencies changing with
D appear in each graph, except for the case of R10 = R20, where only one
decreasing eigenfrequency appears. (When the two bubbles have the same

radii and pulsate in phase, Eq. (6) is reduced to

1 +

This equation has only one eigenfrequency [5,10] of

ω2
1 =

ω2
10
1 + R10/D

,

(18)

which converges to ω2
10 for D → ∞ and decreases with decreasing D.) It is
interesting to point out that the larger bubble, whose partial natural frequency
is lower than that of the smaller bubble, has the highest eigenfrequency among
all the bubbles.

Now we present numerical solutions of Eq. (13) to examine the inﬂuences of
viscosity on eigenfrequencies. Figures 2−4 show the results obtained by using
µ = 1.137×10−3 kg/(m s), which corresponds to the viscosity of water at room
temperature. From those ﬁgures, we can observe that, as the viscous eﬀect
grows strong, i.e., the bubbles’ radii become smaller, the SEFs vanish grad-
ually from the large-distance region (and sometimes from the small-distance
region), and only the FEF remains. In the case of R10 = 1 µm, the SEFs of
a larger bubble disappear, and, when the bubbles are of similar size to each
other, the FEF and the higher SEF of a smaller bubble vanish in the small-
distance region. In the case of R10 = 0.1 µm, it is diﬃcult to distinguish the
SEFs from the FEF since only a smooth curve, decreasing almost monoton-
ically with decreasing l, appears. (The eigenfrequency of the smaller bubble
remaining in the small-distance region may be the lower one of the SEFs.)
Those results show that the inﬂuence of the mutual interaction of the bubbles
on the eigenfrequencies depends on the viscosity of the surrounding material,
and that this interaction weakens as the viscous eﬀect strengthens, i.e., the
threshold of the distance for the appearance of the SEFs is shortened.

Lastly, we brieﬂy discuss the pulsation amplitudes of the bubbles. Figure 5
shows αj ≡ (Pa/Rj0ρ)Aj and βj ≡ (Pa/Rj0ρ)Bj for R1 = 10 µm, R2 = 8
µm, l = 3, and µ = 1.137 × 10−3 kg/(m s) as functions of ω/ω10, where we
set Pa = 0.1P0. The present setting is equivalent to that used for one of the
graphs shown in Fig. 2 except for l. In each graph shown in Fig. 5, we observe
three reversals of the sign of αj and only two resonance responses, as expected.
At the eigenfrequency that does not correspond to the natural frequency (the
highest one of bubble 1 and the second highest one of bubble 2), no resonance
response is obtained. This result conﬁrms that the characteristic frequency
given by Eq. (15) is not the natural frequency.

In summary, it was predicted in this Letter that a gas bubble interacting

7

acoustically with a neighboring bubble has three eigenfrequencies that make
the phase diﬀerence between the bubble’s pulsation and an external sound
be π/2, while readymade theories predict only two natural frequencies. This
present result shows that, in a double-bubble case, the phase reversal of a bub-
ble (e.g., from in-phase to out-of-phase with an external sound) can take place
not only at the bubble’s natural frequencies but also at some other frequency.
The present theory for eigenfrequencies may be useful for understanding the
reversal of the sign of the secondary Bjerknes force, which has so far been
interpreted using only the natural frequencies [5,19,20]. (This subject is dis-
cussed in a separate paper of ours [21].) Furthermore, the present results might
also aﬀect understandings of some related subjects such as acoustic localiza-
tion [22,23] and superresonances [10], previous investigations of which have
employed systems containing only identical bubbles. The present theory for a
double-bubble system will be veriﬁed [24] by the direct-numerical-simulation
technique proposed in Ref. [25], and will be extended to a theory for an N-
bubble system [26], where N denotes an arbitrary positive integer.

Exact solutions for equilibrium conﬁgurations of charged conducting liquid jets

A wide class of exact solutions is obtained for the problem of ﬁnding the equilibrium conﬁgura-
tions of charged jets of a conducting liquid; these conﬁgurations correspond to the ﬁnite-amplitude
azimuthal deformations of the surface of a round jet. A critical value of the linear electric charge
density is determined, for which the jet surface becomes self-intersecting, and the jet splits into two.
It exceeds the density value required for the excitation of the linear azimuthal instability of the
round jet. Hence, there exists a range of linear charge density values, where our solutions may be
stable with respect to small azimuthal perturbations.

INTRODUCTION

Cylindrical jets are known to be unstable with respect
to small surface perturbations because of the develop-
ment of the Rayleigh instability caused by capillary ef-
fects [1]. For electrically charged jets, electrostatic forces
are an additional factor that determines the system be-
havior. The Coulomb interaction of electric charges sup-
presses the large-scale axial capillary instability. On the
contrary, it can lead to the growth of nonaxisymmet-
ric modes of disturbances which are stable for the un-
charged jet (see [2, 3, 4] and references therein). In order
to understand the main laws governing the behavior of
a charged jet, it is important to deﬁne conditions when
the mutual compensation of the electrostatic and cap-
illary forces is possible, as well as the conditions when
such compensation is impossible. Therefore, the neces-
sity arises to determine the region of existence of stable
solutions for the problem of the equilibrium conﬁgura-
tions of the jet surface.

In this paper we consider possible equilibrium shapes
of a charged inﬁnite jet of a conducting liquid (an elec-
tric charge distributes itself over the liquid surface so that
the electric ﬁeld potential is constant everywhere inside
of the conductor). In doing so, we restrict our analysis
to the particular case of the azimuthal deformations of
the initially circular jet (axial deformations can be sup-
pressed by the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld). For this case,
the instability is induced by the electrostatic forces, while
the surface tension forces play a stabilizing role.

We are presently only aware of a few nontrivial solu-
tions of the classical problem in electrostatics, that is the
problem of ﬁnding the stationary conﬁgurations of the
charged surface of a conducting liquid (the ﬂat surface,
the circular cylinder surface, and the sphere belong to the
trivial solutions). We should primarily mention the so-
called Taylor cone. In Ref. [5], Taylor has demonstrated
that the surface electrostatic pressure for a cone with an-

∗Electronic address: nick@ami.uran.ru

gle 98.6◦ is inversely proportional to the distance from
its axis and, hence, can be counterbalanced by the capil-
lary pressure (the sole exception is the cone apex where
the force balance condition is violated). Recently, the
ﬁrst author of the present paper has shown [6] that for
the case of plane symmetry, the problem of the steady-
state shape of the free surface of a conducting liquid in
an external electrical ﬁeld is mathematically similar to
the problem of the progressive capillary wave solved by
Crapper [7]. The analogy provides an easy way of solv-
ing the electrostatics problem [8]. Finally, the method of
constructing exact solutions for the equilibrium conﬁg-
urations of the charged two-dimensional drops was pro-
posed in Ref. [9]. It should be noted that apart from the
transformations, this problem coincides with that of the
stationary shape of a two-dimensional air bubble in a cir-
culatory ambient ﬂow. The solutions found by Zubarev
for an arbitrary mode number n [9] were independently
given by Crowdy for n = 2 [10] and by Wegmann and
Crowdy for n = 3, 4, 5... [11] in the problem with the
bubbles. The approaches developed in Refs. [9, 10, 11]
turn out to be useful for the following analysis of possible
conﬁgurations of charged jets.

The article is made up as follows. In section II we give
the equations deﬁning the equilibrium conﬁguration of
the charged surface of a conducting liquid for the case of
plane symmetry. It is shown that conformal transforma-
tions allows us to reduce the investigation to the analysis
of a nonlinear boundary-value problem on a half-plane for
the Laplace equation. In section III, using the results of
Refs. [9, 10, 11], we obtain exact solutions for the jet con-
ﬁgurations corresponding to the azimuthal mode num-
bers n = 2, 3, 4... In section IV the equilibrium surfaces
corresponding to our solutions are investigated. We for-
mulate the conditions under which the surfaces become
self-intersecting, and the jet splits into several separate
jets. In section V we analyze the dependence of the jet
surface deformation amplitude on the control parame-
ter (linear electric charge density) for diﬀerent azimuthal
numbers. It turns out that we deal with a soft loss of sta-
bility of the round jet surface for n = 2, 3, 4 (supercritical
bifurcation) and with a hard loss of stability for n > 4
(subcritical bifurcation). Section VI contains our conclu-

It is apparent that an inﬁnitely long cylindrical jet with
a circular cross-section (i.e., a round jet) gives the trivial
solution of the problem. In what follows, we will obtain
its nontrivial solutions corresponding to the azimuthal
deformations of the round jet surface.

INITIAL EQUATIONS

Let us write the equations of electrostatics that de-
scribe a stationary proﬁle of the charged surface of the
conducting liquid jet with constant cross-section along
the direction of its motion (see Fig. 1). The distribution
of the electric ﬁeld potential ϕ in the plane of the jet
cross-section
is determined by the Laplace equa-
tion:

x, y

{

It should be solved together with the condition that the
conductor surface is equipotential,

ϕxx + ϕyy = 0.

ϕ = 0,

and also the condition that the ﬁeld of the charged con-
ductor coincides at inﬁnity with the ﬁeld of a uniformly
charged straight ﬁlament:

where Q is the linear electric charge density of the con-
ductor.

The jet will be considered to move at the constant
velocity v along the z-axis of the Cartesian coordinate
system (a ﬂuid is at rest in the system of coordinates
moving with the jet). Then the equilibrium relief of the
charged boundary of a conducting liquid is determined by
the Laplace-Young stress condition, that is the balance
condition for the electrostatic and capillary forces acting
on the surface:

related to an analysis of the proﬁle of a two-dimensional

The formulas (13) and (14) represent a family of exact
two-parametric solutions for the equilibrium shape of a
charged jet of a conducting liquid. To the best of our
knowledge, these solutions for the jet conﬁgurations have
not been considered so far.

IV. CONDITIONS OF THE JET SPLITTING

→

In the limit l

The solutions (13) and (14) obtained in the previous
section enable us to ﬁnd exact critical values of the linear
charge densities required (i) for the onset of the azimuthal
instability of the round jet and (ii) for the jet splitting.
n expressions (13) and (14) for the
equilibrium shape of a charged jet of a conducting liquid
deﬁne circles of radius 2/(n + 1), which correspond to
the unperturbed state of the jet, namely, to the round
jet. With decreasing the parameter l, the jet surface is
deformed. At certain n-dependent critical values ln of
the parameter l, the region occupied by the liquid ceases
to be simply connected, and the jet splits (see Fig. 2–4).
For 1 < l < ln the solutions are physically meaningless
so that for ﬁxed n the set of the problem solutions cor-
responds to the interval ln ≤

n.

Hence it follows that the critical values of l, i.e., the quan-
tities ln, are determined by the set of equations:

(cid:3)

It is easy to see that, dividing (17) by (16), we can elim-
inate the parameter l from these equations. As a result
we obtain the equation for ψ at the point of the curve

where we put h = tan ψ. Solving this equation of the nth
order, we can deﬁne the value of h and, consequently, of
ψ for any n. At given ψ, the sought-for critical values of
the parameter l can be determined from the relation (16),
which can be transformed into the quadratic equation
with respect to the unknown quantity ln.

For n = 3 the expression (18) transforms into the triv-
ial equation h2 = 1, from which it follows that the self-
intersection takes place at ψ = π/4. For this value of the
parameter ψ, the condition (16) reduces to solving the
equation

Its root satisfying the condition 1 < l3 < 3 is l3 = (9 +

2.52. If l = l3, the volume occupied by liquid
loses its simple connectivity and one jet splits into four
unequal parts. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 3.

For n = 4 (see Fig. 4), we obtain from (18): h2 = 5/13,

We now determine the critical values of the parameter

has the form

ψ = π/2,

For n > 2 the condition of the self-intersection of the

surface can be written as

x = 0,

dx/dψ = 0.

For the family of the solutions (13) and (14), the area S

(19)

It enables us to determine the critical values of the charge
density.

In the problem under consideration, we can deﬁne
two critical charge density values for every azimuthal
wavenumber n. The ﬁrst critical density value Qn cor-
responds to the threshold of linear instability of the jet
with round cross section. It can be calculated from the
formula (19), where we must take l = n (recall that for
l = n the expressions (13) and (14) deﬁne circles):

Qn =

π(n + 1)2α2S

1/4

.

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

The critical charge density is seen to grow monotonically
with n. Its minimum value corresponds to n = 2:

Q2 =

1/4

9πα2S
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

≈

2.31 α1/2S1/4.

If the linear charge density Q of the jet exceeds this value,
an electrohydrodynamic instability of the jet surface will
develop. At the initial stage of the process, this leads to
the elliptic deformation of the jet cross-section. The dis-
turbances corresponding to the modes with lesser spatial
scales, n > 2, can grow only at larger values of the linear
charge density.

The second critical density value ˜Qn corresponds to
the situation when the volume occupied by the jet loses
its simple connectivity and the jet splits into two or more
separate jets (see Fig. 2–4). We can ﬁnd it substituting
l = ln into (19):

˜Qn =

πα2S(l2

1)2
4n (cid:21)

The charge density takes the minimal value for n = 2,
whence it follows that the jet splitting into two approx-
imately equal parts can be considered as the most prob-
able scenario of the jet disintegration. Since l2 = 13/7,

5

the exact minimal value of the second critical density is
given by the following expression:

˜Q2 =

1800 πα2S/49
(cid:0)

1/4

≈

3.28 α1/2S1/4.

(cid:1)
Note that the critical densities Qn can be found from
the linear analysis of the stability of the round jet surface
(see, for example, Ref. [3, 12]).
In so doing it is not
necessary to know the exact solutions for the stationary
jet shape. However we must know them for determining
the conditions of the jet splitting or, what is the same,
for ﬁnding the second critical charge densities.

V. STABILITY ANALYSIS

Now consider the dependence of the jet surface defor-
mation amplitude on the linear electric charge density.
Such an analysis will allow us to draw some qualitative
conclusions concerning the stability of the solutions ob-
tained.

It is convenient to take Q2 as a unit of linear elec-
tric charge density and the radius of the unperturbed jet
R0 =
S/π as a unit of length. This implies introducing
both dimensionless charge density q and the deformation
amplitude of the jet surface r:

where Rmax = y
|ψ=0 is the maximum distance between
the jet axis and its surface. These relations give the de-
pendence of r on q for diﬀerent n in the parametric form
(l plays the role of the parameter). The relevant plots are
presented in Fig. 5. The straight line r = 0 in the ﬁgure
corresponds to the unperturbed state of the system, i.e.,
to the round jet.

One can notice that the deformation amplitude mono-
tonically increases with the charge density for n = 2, 3, 4.
This situation corresponds to the soft loss of stability
of the round jet. Indeed, it is clear that if q < Q/Qn,
then the round jet is stable with respect to small sur-
face perturbations with azimuthal wavenumbers greater
than or equal to n. Bifurcations occur when the condition
q = Q/Qn holds (supercritical bifurcation for n = 2, 3, 4).
It is seen from the ﬁgure that the side branches corre-
sponding to our exact solutions fork from the straight line
r = 0. It should be noted that the authors of Ref. [11], in
terms of the present paper, have plotted the dependence
of q2 on p that also indicates the manner in which the
solution branches bifurcate.

As the trivial solution r = 0 is unstable for q > 1, the
free energy of the system can have a minimum on these
branches only. This suggests that the surface modes with

6

stable for all permissible values of the electric charge
density, Q2 < Q < ˜Q2 (we discuss the stability with
respect to surface perturbations that do not violate the
problem symmetry). In all probability, they are unstable
for a suﬃciently large Q. The point is that Q3 < ˜Q2
and Q4 < ˜Q2, and, consequently, the functional of the
jet potential energy can have several extremums corre-
sponding to diﬀerent n at given Q. Moreover, as evident
from Fig. 2, the jet cannot be stable if the charge density
value is close to ˜Q2. An arbitrary small deformation of
the surface can lead to the rupture of the neck. Thus the
condition Q > ˜Q2 may be considered as the suﬃcient
condition for splitting the jet into two.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In the present work we have obtained the two-
parameter family of the exact solutions of the classical
problem in electrostatics, namely, the problem of ﬁnding
the equilibrium conﬁguration of a charged jet of a con-
ducting liquid. The approach applied is based on the con-
formal mapping of the region outside the jet to the half-
plane, that have restricted our consideration to the case
of the plane symmetry of the problem, when all quanti-
ties depend only on two variables x and y (see Fig. 1).
Because of this, all the solutions obtained correspond to
the azimuthal deformations of the jet surface, whereas
the deformations in the direction of the jet axis have not
been considered. At the same time, it is just the lon-
gitudinal instabilities (the varicose and sinuous modes)
that determine the behavior of a charged jet in the gen-
eral case [3]. Nevertheless, if the electrohydrodynamic
instability of the liquid cylinder is suppressed in the di-
rection of the z axis, our solutions can play a dominant
role in the jet behavior. For instance, the growth of the
axial disturbances can be stabilized by the magnetic ﬁeld
directed along the jet axis. It is known [2] that the tan-
gential magnetic ﬁeld retards the development of the sur-
face instabilities which bend the ﬁeld lines (in particular,
this phenomenon is used to conﬁne the plasma). If the
magnetic ﬁeld is suﬃciently strong, the only azimuthal
instability of the jet surface will develop. As it was dis-
cussed in the previous two sections, such instability leads
to the jet splitting.

This study was supported by the President of Rus-
sian Federation (Project No. MK-2149.20042), the Foun-
dation for Support of Russian Science, the “Dynasty”
Foundation and the International Center for Fundamen-
tal Physics in Moscow.

corresponds to the unperturbed state of the system, i.e., to
the round jet.

small azimuthal wavenumbers are excited in a soft regime
and, at least for a small overcriticality, our exact solutions
can be stable with respect to small perturbations that do
not violate the problem symmetry.

For n > 4, the surface deformation amplitude r de-
creases with increase in q in the vicinity of the branch
points (see Fig. 5). Such a dependence of the amplitude
r on the control parameter q corresponds to the subcriti-
cal bifurcation. Then the potential energy of the system,
i.e., the sum of the surface and electric ﬁeld energies, has

lows that our solutions having azimuthal mode numbers
n > 4 are unstable with respect to small changes in the
amplitude r.

Since both the ﬁrst and second critical charge densities
are minimal for the large-scale azimuthal mode n = 2, it
is the surface mode that will deﬁne the jet behavior. If
the linear charge density Q exceeds the value Q2, then
the surface of the cylindrical jet with a round cross sec-
tion becomes unstable. As the instability regime is soft,
then, for a small subcriticality, a new stable state cor-

pears, and the round jet transforms to an elliptic one.
Unfortunately, the analysis of the balance conditions for
the forces acting on the jet surface cannot provide the
answer to the question as to whether our solutions are

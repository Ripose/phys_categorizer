Abstract

A ﬂux of ideal ﬂuid coupled to perturbation is investigated by nonperturbative

methods of the quantum ﬁeld theory. Asymptotic behavior of the ﬂux coupled to

perturbation turns out to be similar to that of superﬂuids.

1 Introduction

The concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking is an important one in modern theoretical

physics. It is known in statistical physics, condensed matter, and nuclear physics, as well

as in relativistic ﬁeld theory. An example of model subject to such a phase transition is

given by an ideal ﬂuid coupled to local external perturbation, [1]. For example, one may

consider a pressure pulse localized in space of inviscid incompressible unbounded ﬂuid

which rises a ﬂuid current with a net momentum ﬂux

perturbation were discussed in [1] in details. As an example of such a behavior one

imagines an eddy risen around a point wise distinct pressure perturbation. It was shown

that the energy of hydrodynamic perturbation is conﬁned within the eddy formed around

the pulse region and demonstrates a power like decay

r−4 outside this region, [1].

In the present paper we consider the water response in the case of symmetry broken,

i.e., when

= 0. Since the symmetry breaking does not aﬀect the scaling properties of the

theory, the universal quantities for the long-range asymptotic behavior of the correlation

functions are the same as in the symmetrical phase. We demonstrate that if

= 0

P 6

the leading order of long-range water response for perturbation is not determined by

the scaling degrees of freedom, but by the anomalies risen due to an explicit symmetry

breaking. The results achieved would give a key for better understanding of various

aspects in the studies of the ocean surface. For example, one can consider the problem

of generating of circulation motions (meanders) close to ocean currents. The grown up

meanders is about to separate from the main current forming the stable closed rings

(which averaged lifetime is about 2-3 years) of hundreds of kilometers in diameter drifting

P 6

slowly along the main current (with an averaged speed of 2-10 cm/s), [3]-[4].

The leading order of correlation functions stationary spectra in the fully developed

turbulence theory of Kolmogorov [5] as well as in the statistical theory of waves based on

the Zakharov’s kinetic equations [3] can be found from pure phenomenology in principle.

However, that is not the case for the water coupled to perturbation. The matter is

of presence of redundant degrees of freedom connected to perturbation as well as to

hydrodynamic equations themselves. To get rid of these degrees of freedom we propose a

physically relevant hypothesis on the mechanism coupling water to perturbation.

In [1] we used the renormalization group (RG) technique to justify such an additional

assumption for the case of O(3)

symmetrical perturbation.

In the framework of RG

method the physical degrees of freedom are to be replaced by the scaling degrees which

−

are related to the physical degrees through the RG transformations of ﬁelds and param-

eters of the theory. Since the properties of scaling degrees of freedom are governed by a

group structure (the renormalization group) one investigates them much easier then those

of the origin problem. The results obtained from RG-analysis are considered as somewhat

statistical steady state limit of the physical system. The renormalized correlation func-

tions are distinguished from their physical analogies only by normalization conditions, so

that they can be also used for the analysis of asymptotic behavior of the physical system.

The investigation of the relevant scaling degrees of freedom which has been brought about

in [1] demonstrates that the asymptotic behavior r >> lp (lp is the perturbation scale)
of water response can be determined unambiguously if one supposes a coupling between

translation and rotation components of the velocity of ﬂuid.

The stationary spectra can have place for those scale intervals which are transparent

for currents of conserved quantities. The conserved energy current from the large-scale

region of pumping into the small-scale range of viscous dissipation allows one to adjust

A Phase Transition in ...

the well known Kolmogorov’s spectrum in the fully developed turbulence (the Five Thirds
Law). However, the inertial range of Kolmogorov lies apart from the scale spectrum of

our interest. The transparency interval related to the enstrophy current (the squared

averaged vorticity)

is exactly the scale of the problem considered, though the enstrophy

current gives us the spectrum of vorticial component of the velocity ﬁeld only,

and φ is the scalar velocity potential. However, the spectrum for φ(k) is still unknown

from these phenomenological considerations.

In language of the critical phenomena theory the spectrum (1) determines the crit-

ical dimension ∆[A] of the ﬁeld A, ∆[A] = 1. The use of critical dimension allows

to compute the spectrum of any correlation function of the ﬁeld A by simple dimen-

sional counting. For example, for the pair correlation function in Fourier representation

Further phenomenological considerations allow to determine the spectra of quantities

which can be measured in experiments, for example, for the energy as a function of

distance apart from the perturbation point, E(r), one can obtain:

tion.

In a regular way α(x) is to be determined from the equation of state

with some function f (j) calculating usually in the framework of Feynman graph expan-

sion, [6]. However, the power-like asymptotic solution for (6) can be derived readily

from phenomenology: considering

as a new dimensional parameter of the theory with

symmetry broken, one obtains the spectrum α(k) in the form

Continuing the analogy with ferromagnets, one can conclude that the ordered phase (of

broken symmetry) water response can be described by a quantity analogous to the longi-

By the way, from the critical phenomena theory point of view the main problems of the

theory in the non-symmetrical phase are to determine an explicit form for the function

f (j) in (6) and to justify the phenomenological result (7).

The plan of the paper follows: First, in the second section, for the convenience of

readers we brieﬂy reproduce the main result of [1] on model of ideal unbounded ﬂuid

coupled to perturbation concluding the section by a discussion on the explicit symmetry

breaking. The statistical properties of hydrodynamical system can be described by a

partition function of statistical mechanics with a classical euclidean action. As a result

we derive the classical action functional designed to describe the long-range asymptotic

behavior of the water coupled to perturbation. The relevant functional turns out to be

analogous to that one of the abelian Higgs model well-known in relativistic ﬁeld theory

and superconductivity.

In the next section we observe the basic properties of the theory in case of an explicit

−

U(1)

symmetry breaking and consider the physical consequences for the asymptotic be-

havior of the model. These properties are dramatically diﬀerent from those demonstrated

by the model in the symmetrical case discussed in [1]. In the latter phase scaling degrees

of freedom were completely determined by the vector velocity potential A, though in

A Phase Transition in ...

presence of comparably strong ﬂuid ﬂow the vector velocity components are conﬁned in

the ﬂux and their contributions are irrelevant for the asymptotic behavior of the system.

Looking for the stable stationary solutions, we obtain an inﬁnite countable set of such

solutions distinguished one from the other by energy gaps. In particular, a ”ground state”

solution can be interpreted as a pure laminar ﬂow (A

0).

≡

In the fourth section we consider the asymptotic for α(r) in case of the laminar ﬂow;

it is provided by a Goldstone asymptotics arising by an explicit U(1)

symmetry breaking

−

which has place in the real physical system.

To account the contributions of eddies into ﬂux for ”excited states” we construct an

instanton solution for the theory of water coupled to perturbation and ﬁnd the interval

of validity for the phenomenological result (7) in the ﬁfth section.

In the Section 6, we discuss the results obtained from the point of view of dynamical

systems theory. We conclude in the last section.

2 The Model of Ideal Unbounded Fluid Coupled to

Perturbation

In [1] it was shown that after elimination of all redundant degrees of freedom the problem

considered possesses the entire U(1)

gauge symmetry [8]. In case of j

= 0 this symmetry

turns out to be hidden by an explicit symmetry breaking term appearing in the eﬀective

−

action functional. To reveal the hidden symmetry of hydrodynamics of ideal ﬂuid we ﬁrst

suppose j = 0. Then the equation of hydrodynamics takes the form

div v(x, t) = 0,

p(x, t) =

Here v(x, t) is the velocity of ﬂuid and p(x, t) is the pressure distribution. The trivial

boundary conditions for the ﬁelds at inﬁnity are implied.

The equations (10) do not lead to a hamiltonian in the usual way, since it is not

possible to deﬁne the conjugated moments. Nevertheless, these equations can be derived

from the classical Lagrangian

The last term in (15) does not meet the entire symmetry (12), since the pressure ﬁeld as it

is included in the action functional contains somewhat redundant degrees of freedom, we

therefore can integrate it over in the partition function Z. The result of functional integra-

tion does not depend on p(x, t). This procedure is reduced to elimination of the quadratic
term proportional to (∂p)2 from (15) and the replacement of the U(1)

which relates the ﬂuctuations of velocity ﬁelds risen by the perturbative pulse in the

perturbed region Vp to those ﬂuctuations apart from Vp.

In [1] we investigated possible contributions of (16) into the action functional con-

sidering the insertions of various power like composite operators. It was shown that the

only component which is important from the RG point of view have to be U(1)-gauge

symmetrical, i.e.,

m2φ2

(17)

in the ﬁrst order, where m2 is somewhat mass parameter (the coeﬃcient of the rele-

vant RG-invariant composite operator). The use of Ward identities which express the

U(1)

gauge invariancy of the theory allows to demonstrate that all other combinations

of quadratic operators are ultra-violet (UV) ﬁnite, i.e., the relevant correlation functions

do not have UV-divergencies, and then they do not participate in scaling degrees of free-

dom.

. Due to strong nonlinearity of interaction in hydrody-

for the coupling mechanism by inclusion of the ϕ4-type interaction term into (15) with a

wave modes coupling constant g > 0. In accordance with the general critical phenomena
approach we note that the accounting of highest oscillation harmonics, i.e., ϕ6, ϕ8, and so

on cannot alter the large-distance asymptotic behavior of water response if g

= 0. Again,

since we are interested in U(1)

gauge symmetrical term the only amendments into action

functional have to be of the form,

As a resulting hypothesis we obtain the eﬀective action functional to be:

The action (18) has some redundant degrees of freedom, the gauge degrees, with

unknown dynamics. As a consequence it is not renormalizable, and it has no solutions
in the massless limit m2 = 0, [6]. To construct a renormalizable theory we introduce an

of velocity potential just carries on the ﬂuctuations of the scalar potential ﬁeld φ(x).

By the way, two solutions for diﬀerent points φ(x, t) and φ(y, t) are related through the

parallel transporter (20), where C is an integration path connecting the points x and y,

[8].

Now, the gauge degrees of freedom (correspondent to invariancy of velocity with re-

)) auxiliary gauge parameter of the theory. The

model (21) demonstrates the existence of a statistically steady state independently of the

details of velocity evolution.

In [1] the model (21) has been investigated in the symmetrical phase, m2 > 0. The

crucial distinction between symmetry implementation in the cases of positive and negative
signs for m2 lies though in the structure of the ”ground state” (i.e., the expectation value

of velocity potential).

Suppose, ﬁrst, that A = 0 in (21), then one has the standard model of a scalar

unharmonic oscillator. For m = 0 the oscillator is subject to a phase transition. At
the classical level in the symmetrical phase (m2 > 0) the oscillator model describes the

parameter of the group U(1) under certain physical conditions, then for the ﬁeld φ there

are two possible mean values (see Fig. 1.b)

(22)

net ﬂuid current from the region of initial perturbation into outside (see Fig.2) one can

treat as a result of spontaneously symmetry breaking which can be described by (21) with
m2 < 0.

If we held A = 0, the lagrangian is still invariant under the set of U(1)-transformations

with no gauge section. When j = 0, the Goldstone theorem predicts the appearance of a

massless degree of freedom corresponding to unphysical ”angular motion” for which there

is no restoring force. The physical interpretation of such a degree of freedom would be

where Re[φ(x, t)] is the real part of the complex valued ﬁeld φ. This symmetry breaking
term gives in the ﬁrst order in j a mass proportional to j1/2∂iIi (the axial current Ii is no
more conserved) to the unphysical angular degree of freedom correspondent to rotations
in the complex plain (i.e., (8) has no more divergent).

The situation is though to be changed dramatically if one includes the vorticial velocity
= 0). Due to so called Higgs mechanism the angular

component into consideration (A

degree of freedom does not produce divergences in (8) even in the zero order in j, and the

gauge ﬁeld Ai acquires a mass without spoiling the gauge invariance and renormalizability
of the theory, [8]-[9]. These ideas which are quite familiar in the weak interactions theory

and superconductivity allow an heuristic interpretation also in hydrodynamics: In the

symmetrical phase (j = 0) A plays the purely transporting role for scalar velocity potential

ﬂuctuations from one point to another in accordance with (20). When the symmetry is

broken spontaneously, A acquires the longitudinal polarization degree of freedom giving

it a mass; as a direct consequence a vector potential ﬁeld can penetrate only exponentially

into the ﬂuid ﬂow with a range proportional to the inverse of the acquired mass. Like

a superconductor expels a magnetic ﬁeld from its interior, except for a thin layer at

the surface over which the ﬁeld decreases exponentially, the ﬂuid ﬂow ousts the eddies

from its interior onto the periphery. The microscopic origin of the Higgs phenomenon

in hydrodynamics lies in screening currents of ﬂuid compensating the external velocity

rotational component (see Fig.3).

In [1] it was shown that the scaling degrees of freedom proportional to g are vanished

from the asymptotic behavior of ﬂuid involved into eddy motion. By the way, considering
j = 0 (say, on the periphery skin of a large-scale current), one can omit the term gφ4

from (21) to obtain the relevant eﬀective action functional. However, if j

= 0 (within the

current), from the heuristic point of view it is obvious that the statistical steady state
should be free of coupling to the vector potential A, and the solution for α(x) (i.e., (7))

is to be determined by a Goldstone asymptotics, [11].

In the present section we develop the heuristic ideas of the preceding one. We derive the

action functional for the theory in case of symmetry spontaneously broken and investigate

its properties.

Implementing the local transformation

to the model action functional relevant to the system of equations (10), we ﬁx the gauge

in such a way that

The behavior of (27) is in a way very diﬀerent from (21): the unphysical imaginary

The standard way to illustrate the last sentence is to demonstrate that the response of

the ﬂux for an elementary vortex immersed in is equal to zero [14]. Consider the constant

shift transformation (a purely vorticial constant velocity component)

for the gauge section Fij in the disordered theory (21). Then the partition function Z[fij]
is invariant under gauge transformations:

since it can be compensated by the appropriate change Ai →
gauge-invariant theory (21) one has

Ai + λi. Therefore, in a

furthermore, one notes that the constant fij can be removed from (21) by the transfor-
mation:

In the phase with long-range correlations (21), the change (31) is equivalent to somewhat

change of trivial boundary conditions for the equations (10) at inﬁnity. In particular, this

yields the new term into the partition function

where εA (the Lagrange multiplier) would be some function which has a natural interpre-

if the circulation Γ < Γ0, where Γ0 is some critical value correspondent to the phase
transition point, the vector potential becomes short-range correlated, and the partition

function Z should not depend on fij. Thus εA = 0 in the theory (27).

In case of the vector velocity potential A is strong enough then, because of circulation

conservation, it can be allowed in the ﬂuid ﬂow in the form of narrow ﬂux tubes. The

relation (26) in this context means that there are always an integer number n of such

vorticial tubes in the ﬂow, i.e., that each of them have a source and a sink (see Fig.4).

Varying (27) with respect to Ai and φ∗φ with the boundary condition (26) (i.e., ﬁxing
the circulation u−1 to be constant in ideal ﬂuid), one can easily estimate the energy of a
ﬂux with length lf as

This situation is analogous to that of superconductors [13]:

if electrically charged

bosons (Cooper’s bound state of an electron pair) Bose-condensed then there the electric

ﬁelds become short-range, and the magnetic ﬁelds are ousted from the interior. If ﬁnally

a magnetic ﬁeld is admitted inside a superconductor it can only come in some multiple

vortices, never spread out because of Meissner eﬀect. Following the analogy with super-

conductors, one can say that the source and the sink vortices conﬁned in the ﬂuid ﬂow

are kept together in a potential well, and the potential is being linearly proportional to

their separation.

As it well known, [9]-[10], the hidden symmetry begets the hidden renormalizability:

the divergence structure of renormalizable theory (21) is unaﬀected by spontaneous sym-

metry breaking, and the counterterms needed in (27) remain those of the symmetrical

theory (21). Consequently, the critical dimensions calculated in [1] for the quantities in

(21) are still valid formally also for (27).

has no vorticial components (i.e., the ﬂux contains no vorticial pairs, n = 0 in (25)).

Therefore, to describe the statistical properties of the system we can integrate the partition

function Z[φ, A] over A eliminating the vector ﬁeld A from the theory. The resulting

partition function will depend solely on the scalar velocity potential, Z[φ], and the relevant
action functional will be identical to those of scalar φ4

The distinguishing feature of (35) is the presence of Goldstone singularities which arise

due to an explicit U(1)

is following, [14]: the scalar velocity potentials with diﬀerent orientation in the complex

5 The Instanton Solutions for the Theory of Water

Coupled to Perturbation

In the previous sections we have considered the stationary (with no time dependence)

stable solutions of (27) which correspond to the saddle points (solutions of the hydrody-

namical equations). However, in the case discussed, j

= 0, the actual hydrodynamical

equations, posses the non-constant solutions also.

In the previous sections we have shown that there is a countable set of possible stable

stationary solutions (enumerated by an integer number n) for the system of ﬂux coupled

to perturbation distinguished one from the other by the energy gaps (33). Obviously,

the non-constant statistically steady solutions are related to a speciﬁc mechanism of gap
generation (the generation of new pairs of eddies in the ﬂux), i.e., they describe possible

transitions between constant solutions with diﬀerent Γn (26).

6
A Phase Transition in ...

Another interpretation can be used: since the source and sink eddies are conﬁned

together in the potential well in the ﬂuid ﬂux, one can consider a tunneling process of

the eddy pair into another potential well. This tunneling process can be provided by an
instanton solution [14]. The contribution of instantons into the correspondent partition

functional Z is indeed irrelevant if we are interested in relatively short periods of time

t < t0, where t0 is a ”tunnelling time”. However, for t > t0, it becomes very large.

Consider the action (35) in case of the symmetry broken spontaneously. Classical

minima of this action deﬁned from the equation:

where φ1,2 are the real and imaginary parts of the ﬁeld φ, φ = (φ1 + φ2)/√2. We use the

The problem of existence and stability of the solution of (44) with (45) were discussed in

[14]. The eﬀective asymptotical solution is given in the preceding section by the Goldstone

asymptotics. Suppose now that one has introduced a set of vortices, placed at the points

xa with circulations Γa into the ﬂux (35). The partition function of statistical mechanics
Z is then to be presented in the form (in case of α0 ≫

u2)

Z = Z0Zinst,

where Z0 is the standard partition function of the theory (35) and

(L being the size of the ﬂux pattern considered; the second term is the vortex self-

energy). One can see that in case of large ﬂuid ﬂux α0 and, consequently, strong conﬁning
property the vortices revolving alternatively are combined into pairs. Such pairs have

very small inﬂuence on the correlation functions and are irrelevant in case of large α0.
The asymptotics provided by the instanton solutions is just the same as (41).

6 Discussion from the Point of View of Dynamical

Systems Theory

The Navier-Stockes equation for an ideal ﬂuid can be replaced by the relation for the

pressure ﬁeld, and the Galilean invariance of hydrodynamical equations is manifested as

a U(1)

gauge invariance (12).

−

We shall concern with the phase space (of inﬁnite dimensionality) relevant to the

dynamical system of water coupled to perturbation and limit ourselves to a qualitative

consideration. Picturing the instant states of the system in the phase space, we obtain its

phase diagram. The stable stationary solutions discussed in [1] and in the present paper

can be interpreted as the attraction regions or ﬁxed points of trajectories of the system

in the phase space.

Consider the manifold of initial conditions correspondent to the only solution of dis-

ordered phase (

= 0). In [1] we have shown that it can be realized exceptionally as an

eddy risen around a point-wise distinct perturbation. One can imagine this manifold as

P

a torus covered by the trajectories tending to some stable cycle (see Fig.5).

If we chose a point apart from the torus as the initial condition (for example, the points

A or B on the diagram Fig. 5), the system will leave the vicinity of the torus and tends

to some region of attraction which is closed in a sense that there are no trajectories going

out of it. This behavior represents a phase transition in the language of statistical theory.

Within the attraction region the trajectory passes consequently through an inﬁnite set of
ﬁxed points distinguishing by the Γn values (12). Most of these points are hetreoclinic,
and so that they are unstable in a sense that the smallest deviation from the certain set

of initial conditions will make the system trajectory to jump to some other point. These

processes, in principle, are to be described by the instanton solutions (see Sec. 5).

This technique would provide us with information on the transition probabilities be-

tween the particular heteroclinic ﬁxed points. Such a quantity could be naturally in-

terpreted within the context of the dynamical systems theory. Let us surround each
heteroclinic ﬁxed point by a ball of radius ε and consider a ﬁxed point n0 which cor-
responds to the solution with Γn0 (see Fig. 5). Taking ε to be small enough, we can
make the volume of each ball to be ﬁnite. Denote the volume of a ball sector starting

from which the trajectory of the system drops into the ε-vicinity of the other point, ni,
as Vε(n0 →

ni). Then, one can introduce the quantity

P (n0 →

ni) =

Vε(n0 →
ni)
k,k6=0 Vε(n0 →

nk)

P

(48)

which is analogous to a transition probability deﬁned in the statistical theory.

If the

A Phase Transition in ...

16

point which we have chosen is a homoclinic attractive ﬁxed point, the probability (48)
then tends to zero. 0 < P < 1 for heteroclinic points, and P = 1 for a repelling point.

We do not know a priori whether there are some homoclinic attractive ﬁxed points in
the region of attraction (see Fig. 5) or there are only the heteroclinic points. We expect

though that in case of α

u there is a degeneracy of solutions in a sense that they are

predicted by the Goldstone asymptotics.

≫

7 Conclusion

In a conclusion one can say that the ﬂux of ideal ﬂuid coupled to local external pertur-

bation in the region r > lp demonstrates asymptotically some properties similar to those
of superﬂuids. In [1] and in the present paper we have considered the statistically steady

asymptotic solutions of the model by various nonperturbative techniques of the quan-

tum ﬁeld theory. The results on RG-analysis, Goldstone asymptotics, and instanton-type

solutions are, by the way, exact, and they demonstrate that the long-standing hydrody-

namical problem of water coupled to perturbation, in principle, can be treated as a critical

phenomenon.

The relevant physical system contains too many redundant degrees of freedom. To ﬁx

the statistically stable behavior in the system one needs to add some extra assumptions

on the character of perturbation as well as on the character of wave modes coupling. The

model describing such a behavior is subject to a phase transition managed basically by

the perturbation symmetry. Roughly speaking, the symmetry properties of the initial

perturbation deﬁne whether the vorticial or translational ﬂuid velocity components is the

most important one for the long-range asymptotic ﬂuid response.

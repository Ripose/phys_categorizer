An ideal compressible ﬂuid is considered, with the equi-
librium density being a given function of coordinates due to
the presence of some static external forces. The slow ﬂows in
such system, which don’t disturb the density, are investigated
with the help of the Hamiltonian formalism. The equations of
motion of the system are derived for an arbitrary given topol-
ogy of the vorticity ﬁeld. The general form of the Lagrangian
for frozen-in vortex lines is established. The local induction
approximation for the motion of slender vortex ﬁlaments in
several inhomogeneous systems is studied.

I. PRELIMINARY REMARKS

The hydrodynamic-type systems of equations are ex-
tensively employed for macroscopic description of phys-
ical phenomena in ordinary and superﬂuid liquids,
in
gases, in plasma, in other substances.
In solving hy-
drodynamic problems, it is admissible in many cases to
neglect all dissipative processes and use the ideal ﬂuid
approximation, at least as the ﬁrst step. With this ap-
proximation. a dynamic model describing ﬂow is conser-
vative. The Hamiltonian formalism is a convenient tool
to deal with such systems [1], [2], which makes possible
to classify in a universal way all the nonlinear processes.
A big number of works is devoted to application of the
Hamiltonian method in hydrodynamics (see, for instance,
the review [3] and references therein).

One of the most important questions, permitted for
a universal consideration in the frame of Hamiltonian
formalism, is the question about integrals of motion of
a dynamic system. Accordingly to the Noether’s the-
orem the conservation laws are closely connected with
the symmetry of the Lagrangian with respect to some
one-parametric group of transformations of the dynam-
ical variables.
It is well known that the conservation
laws for the energy, for the momentum, and for the an-
gular momentum follow from the fundamental properties
of the space and time, namely from homogeneity of the
time and from homogeneity and isotropy of the space.
Due to these properties, shifts and turns of the system
do not change its Lagrangian.

The characteristic feature of the hydrodynamic-type
systems is that they possess, besides the indicated usual
integrals of motion, an inﬁnite number of the speciﬁc in-
tegrals of motion – for instance, in isentropic ﬂows the

circulation of the canonical momentum along any frozen-
in closed contour is conserved. In usual non-relativistic
hydrodynamics, where the canonical momentum coin-
cides with velocity, the given statement is known as the
Kelvin’s theorem about conservation of the velocity cir-
culation [4].

From the viewpoint of the Lagrangian formalism, the
conservation of these quantities is due to the special sym-
metry of the equations of ideal hydrodynamics [5]- [8]. In
the Lagrangian description each ﬂuid particle is labeled
by a three-dimensional vector a. The dynamics of the
ﬂuid is determined by indicating the positions x(a, t) of
each ﬂuid particle at an arbitrary moment in time t. The
equations of motion for mapping r = x(a, t) follow from
the variational principle

δZ L{x(a, t), ˙x(a, t)}dt = 0.

The Lagrangian L of the isentropic ﬂuid admits an in-
ﬁnitely parametric symmetry group – it assumes the
same value on all mappings x(a, t) for which the Eu-
lerian characteristics of the ﬂow are the same – the den-
sity ρ(r, t) = det||∂a(r, t)/∂r|| and the velocity v(r, t) =
˙x(a(r, t), t). Such mappings diﬀer from one another only
by a relabeling of the Lagrangian labels a, which is why
the symmetry group is called the relabeling group. All
conservation laws for the vorticity are a consequence of
this symmetry of the Lagrangian with respect to rela-
beling of the labels (according the Noether’s theorem).
The most general formulation of these laws postulates
the existence of a local vector Lagrangian invariants –
the Cauchy invariant [9].

The very important characteristics of a Hamiltonian
system exists, namely the ﬁeld of the canonical momen-
tum p(r, t), which is deﬁned as follows (see for details
the paper [10])

p(r, t) ≡

δL

δ ˙x(a(r, t))

=

1

ρ (cid:18) δL{ρ, v}

δv (cid:19) .

(1)

It should be emphasized that in general case (for in-
stance, in relativistic hydrodynamics or in presence of
the magnetic ﬁeld) the canonical momentum p does not
coincide with the velocity v. The equality p = v takes
place only in the simplest models with a quadratic on v
Lagrangians like in ordinary Eulerian hydrodynamics

LE = Z (cid:18)ρ

v2

2 − ε(ρ) − ρU (r)(cid:19) d3r,

(2)

1

where ε(ρ) is the internal energy density, U (r) is the ex-
ternal force potential, for instance, the gravitational po-
tential.

On the level of Eulerian description of ﬂows, the exis-
tence of the Cauchy invariant is attested by the frozen-
ness equation for the vorticity Ω which is deﬁned as the
curl of the canonical momentum ﬁeld

Ω(r, t) = curl p(r, t).

(3)

The dynamics of Ω follows from the variational Euler-
Lagrange equation for the mapping x(a, t). This equa-
tion takes the next form, being rewritten in terms of the
density and velocity ﬁelds (see [10] for details)

(∂t + v · ∇)(cid:18) 1
ρ ·

δv(cid:19) = ∇(cid:18) δL
δL

δρ(cid:19) −

1

ρ (cid:18) δL

δvm(cid:19)∇vm,

(4)

and it completely determines the dynamics of the system,
together with the continuity equation

ρt + ∇(ρv) = 0

(5)

It is easy to check that application of the curl-operator
to the equation (4) gives

Ωt = curl[v × Ω].

The formal solution of the last equation is

Ω(r, t) =

(Ω0(a)∇a)x(a, t)

detk∂x(a, t)/∂ak(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=x−1(r,t)
= Z δ(r − x(a, t))(Ω0(a)∇a)x(a, t)d3a,

=

(6)

(7)

with the solenoidal independent on time ﬁeld Ω0(a) being
exactly the Cauchy invariant. The equation (7) displays
that the lines of the initial solenoidal ﬁeld Ω0(a) are de-
formed in the course of motion by the mapping x(a, t),
keeping all the topological characteristics unchanged [11].
This property of the vortex lines motion is called the
frozenness.

The presence of an inﬁnite number of integrals of mo-
tion inﬂuences strongly the dynamical and statical prop-
erties of the liquid systems. This is the reason why the
clariﬁcation of the structure of conservation laws, as well
as the search for such new parameterizations of the dy-
namical variables, which take into account the integrals
of motion more completely, are very important. In many
cases, when a level of dissipation is low, it is still correct
to speak about the integrals of the corresponding con-
servative problem, because the values of some of them
are conserved with a high accuracy, especially on the
initial stage of the evolution, while the system has not
proceeded to a state where the role of the dissipation
is signiﬁcant due to large gradients. Besides this, the

2

conservation laws in the physical systems, as a rule, are
associated with deﬁnite geometrical objects. The use of
these associations promotes the understanding and vivid
imagination of everything what happens.
In hydrody-
namic models, the frozen-in vortex lines are such geo-
metrical objects, so the present work is devoted to the
study of their motion in the spatially non-homogeneous
systems.

Hydrodynamical equations of motion describe, in par-
ticular, an interaction between ”soft” degrees of freedom
of the system – the vortices, and ”hard” degrees of free-
dom – the sound.
In the limit of slow ﬂows, when a
typical velocity of vortex structures motion is small in
comparison with the sound speed, the dynamic regime
is possible, in which the hard degrees of freedom corre-
sponding to deviations of the density ρ(r, t) from its equi-
librium conﬁguration ρ0(r), are excited weakly. Then,
with complete neglecting the sound, in the homogeneous
case ρ0 = const one arrives at the models of incompress-
ible ﬂuid.

For dynamics of vortices in incompressible perfect
ﬂuid, the so called formalism of vortex lines has been
developed recently [12], [13], [10], [14], which takes into
account the conservation of topology of the vorticity ﬁeld.
Application of this formalism allows everyone to deal
with the partially integrated system, where the topol-
ogy is ﬁxed by the Cauchy invariant. It should be noted
that actually this formalism is used in hydrodynamics
and the theory of super-ﬂuidity for a rather long time in
description of localized vortex structures – point vortices
on the plane (see, for instance, [15], [16], [17] and refer-
ences therein), and for inﬁnitely thin vortex ﬁlaments in
the 3D space [18], [19]. As known, one of the diﬃculties in
work with such singular objects is the problem of regular-
ization of divergences in expressions for certain physical
quantities, which is especially critical in the 3D case. In
the works [12], [13], [10], [14] the route is traced how to
take into account the most important degrees of freedom
in the analysis of these 3D structures, avoiding the in-
ﬁnities in the expressions for the physical quantities. In
the new description the frozen-in solenoidal ﬁeld is con-
sidered as the continuous distribution of the elementary
objects – vortex lines. It is important that in the incom-
pressible ﬂuid the dynamics of these objects is autonomic
and essentially transverse, i.e. the distribution of the La-
grangian particles along vortex lines doesn’t inﬂuence the
corresponding equation of motion of the lines themselves.
Such an approach has allowed also to construct a set of
integrable hydrodynamic models, diﬀerent from Eulerian
hydrodynamics, which exhibit the ﬁnite time singularity
developing from smooth initial data [14]. Such models
can help in understanding the collapse problem in ideal
hydrodynamics.

The goal of the present work is to extend the vortex
line formalism to the case when the equilibrium density
ρ0(r) is a ﬁxed non-trivial function of spatial coordinates

due to the static inﬂuence of some external forces. For
examples, it can be the gravitational force for a large
mass of an isentropic gas, both in usual and in relativis-
tic hydrodynamics, or it can be the condition of electrical
neutrality for the electron ﬂuid on the given background
of ion distribution in the model of the electron magne-
tohydrodynamics (EMHD). The theory developed here
can be also applied to the tasks about long-scale dynam-
ics of the quantized vortex ﬁlaments in the Bose-Einstein
condensate placed into a trap of a suﬃciently large size.

II. HAMILTONIAN DYNAMICS OF VORTEX

LINES

So, let the dynamics of the system is speciﬁed by some

Hamilton’s functional H{ρ, p}

H = Z (cid:16) δL

δv · v(cid:17)d3r − L,

(8)

where the velocity v is expressed through the momen-
tum p and the density ρ with the help of (1). Let’s note
that the velocity ﬁeld can be expressed through the vari-
ational derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to the
canonical momentum by the formula

v =

1

ρ (cid:18) δH

δp(cid:19) ,

(9)

which is analogous to the formula (1). The Hamiltonian
(non-canonical) equations of motion for the ﬁelds of den-
sity and momentum follow from (5) and (4). With taking
into account the equality (9) they have the form (for de-
tailed derivation see [10])

ρt + ∇(cid:18) δH

δp(cid:19) = 0,

pt = (cid:20)(cid:18) δH

δp(cid:19) ×

curl p

ρ

(cid:21) − ∇(cid:18) δH

δρ (cid:19) .

(10)

(11)

Note, that the ﬁrst equation in this system is nothing
else but the continuity equation.

In the regime under consideration, which corresponds
formally to the ”prohibition” of the sound degrees of free-
dom, the ﬂow of the ﬂuid occurs in such a way that the
density of each moving portion of ﬂuid follows the given
function ρ0(r), which doesn’t depend on time. Therefore
the equation (10) gives the condition

∇(cid:18) δH

δp(cid:19) = 0,

(12)

which means that after imposing the constrain ρ = ρ0(r)
the Hamiltonian does not depend anymore on the po-
tential component of the canonical momentum ﬁeld, it

3

depends now only on the solenoidal component, actually
on the vorticity Ω. The condition (12) implies the valid-
ity of the formula

δH
δp

= curl(cid:18) δH

δΩ(cid:19) ,

(13)

so the next equation for the vorticity dynamics follows
from (11)

Ωt = curl(cid:20)curl(cid:18) δH

δΩ(cid:19) ×

Ω

ρ0(r)(cid:21)

(14)

This equation diﬀers only by presence of the function
ρ0(r) (instead of the unity) from the equation used in
the works [13] and [14] as the start point in the tran-
sition to the vortex line representation in homogeneous
systems. Therefore all the further constructions will be
done similarly to Ref. [14]. First, let us ﬁx the topology
of the vorticity ﬁeld by means of the formula

Ω(r, t) = Z δ(r − R(a, t))(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)da =

=

(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)

detk∂R/∂ak

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=R−1(r,t)

(15)

where Ω0(a) is the Cauchy invariant, and the vector

T(a, t) = (Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)

(16)

is directed along the vorticity ﬁeld at the point r =
R(a, t).
It is necessary to stress that the information
supplied by the mapping R(a, t) is not so full as the in-
formation supplied by the purely Lagrangian mapping
x(a, t). The role of the mapping R(a, t) is exhausted by
a continuous deformation of the vortex lines of the initial
ﬁeld Ω0. This means that the Jacobian

J = detk∂R/∂ak

(17)

is not related directly to the density ρ0(r),
inasmuch
as, as against the mapping x(a, t), the new mapping
R(a, t) is deﬁned up to an arbitrary non-uniform shift
along the vortex lines. The geometrical meaning of the
representation (15) becomes more clear if instead of a
we will use the so called vortex line coordinate sys-
tem (ν1(a), ν2(a), ξ(a)), so the 2D Lagrangian coordinate
ν = (ν1, ν2) ∈ N is the label of vortex lines, which lies
in some manifold N , while the longitudinal coordinate ξ
parameterizes the vortex line. Locally, vortex line coordi-
nate system exists for arbitrary topology of the vorticity
ﬁeld, but globally – only in the case when all the lines are
closed. In the last case the equation (15) can be rewritten
in the simple form

Ω(r, t) = ZN

d2νI δ(r − R(ν, ξ, t))Rξdξ.

(18)

The geometrical meaning of this formula is evident – the
frozen-in vorticity ﬁeld is presented as the continuous dis-
tribution of vortex lines. It is also clear that the choice
of the longitudinal parameter is non-unique. This choice
is determined exclusively by convenience of use in a par-
ticular task.

The use of the formula

− H{Ω{R}},

(25)

it is possible to obtain the indicated integrals of motion
in the next form (compare with Ref. [20])

IΨ = ZN

Ψ(ν1, ν2)d2νI ρ0(R)([R1 × R2] · Rξ)dξ (26)

Ωt(r, t) = curlrZ δ(r − R(a, t))[Rt(a, t) × T(a, t)]da,

where Ψ(ν1, ν2) is an arbitrary function on the manifold
N of labels, with the only condition Ψ|∂N = 0.

(19)

which follows immediately from Eq.(15), together with
the general relationship between variational derivatives
of an arbitrary functional F{Ω}
δΩ(R)(cid:19)(cid:21) =

(cid:20)T × curl(cid:18) δF

(20)

δF

δR(a)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Ω0

allow to obtain the equation of motion for the mapping
R(a, t) by substitution of the representation (15) into the
equation (14). So the dynamics of the mapping R(a, t)
is determined by the equation

[(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a) × Rt(a)] ρ0(r) =

δH{Ω{R}}

δR(a)

. (21)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Ω0

It is non diﬃcult to check by the direct calculation that
the given equation of motion follows from the variational

principle δR LΩ0 dt = 0, where the Lagrangian is
LΩ0 = Z (cid:16) [Rt(a) × D(R(a))] · (Ω0(a)∇a)R(a)(cid:17)da

− H{Ω{R}},

(22)

with the vector function D(R) being related to the den-
sity ρ0(r) by the equality

(∇R · D(R)) = ρ0(R).

(23)

It should be stressed that conservation in time of the
ﬂuid amount inside each closed frozen-in vortex surface
is not imposed a priori as a constrain for the mapping
R(a, t). All such quantities are conserved in the dynam-
ical sense due to the symmetry of the Lagrangian (22)
with respect to the group of relabelings of the labels ν of
vortex lines

ν = ν(˜ν, t),

∂(ν1, ν2)
∂(˜ν1, ˜ν2)

= 1.

(24)

Considering all the one-parametrical sub-groups of the
given group of area-preserving transformations and ap-
plying the Noether’s theorem to the Lagrangian (22)
rewritten in terms of vortex lines

LN = ZN

III. THE LOCAL INDUCTION

APPROXIMATION

When solving a particular task, the necessity always
arises in making some simpliﬁcations. The variational
formulation for the dynamics of vortex lines allows to in-
troduce and control various approximations on the level
of the Lagrangian (25), what in practice is more conve-
nient and more simple then the control of the approxima-
tions made on the level of equations of motion. For exam-
ple we will consider now the so called local induction ap-
proximation (LIA) in dynamics of a slender non-stretched
vortex ﬁlament. In spatially homogeneous systems LIA
leads to the integrable equation of motion, which is gauge
equivalent to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation [21].

At ﬁrst, we will consider the Eulerian hydrodynamics,
where the canonical momentum and the velocity coin-
cide. Let the vorticity be concentrated in a quasi-one-
dimensional structure like vortex ﬁlament, with a typical
longitudinal scale L being much larger then the width d
of the ﬁlament. A typical scale of spatial inhomogeneity
is supposed to be of order of L or larger. In such situa-
tion the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid is concentrated in the
vicinity of the ﬁlament, with the corresponding integral
being logarithmically large on the parameter L/d. The
LIA consist in the following simpliﬁcations. First, in the
kinetic part of the Lagrangian (25), the dependence of
the shape of vortex lines on the label ν is neglected, i.e.
the ﬁlament is considered as a single curve R(ξ, t). Af-
ter integration over d2ν the constant multiplier Γ appears
now, which is the value of velocity circulation around the
ﬁlament. Second, instead of derivation of the dependence
v{ρ0, Ω} from the following system of equations

curl v = Ω,

div (ρ0(r) · v) = 0

and instead of substitution of v into the expression for the
kinetic energy and dealing with a non-local Hamiltonian
of the form

H = 1/2Z Z Gαβ (r1, r2)Ωα(r1)Ωβ(r2)dr1dr2,

it is possible to put, with the logarithmic accuracy, the
Hamiltonian of the thin vortex ﬁlament equal to the fol-
lowing expression

HA = ΓAI ρ0(R)|Rξ|dξ,

A =

Γ
4π

ln(cid:18) L

d(cid:19) = const.

(27)

of the equilibrium density inside the space region where
the density is not exponentially small, and use the ap-
proximate formula

In accordance with the simpliﬁcations made above, the
motion of the slender vortex ﬁlament in the spatially in-
homogeneous system is described approximately by the
equation

[Rξ × Rt]ρ0(R)/A = ∇ρ0(R)·|Rξ|− ∂ξ(cid:18)ρ0(R) ·

Rξ

|Rξ|(cid:19) ,

which is obtained by substitution of the Hamiltonian (27)
into the equation (21). The given equation can be solved
with respect to Rt and rewritten in terms of the geo-
metrically invariant objects t, b, κ, where t is the unit
tangent vector on the curve, b is the unit binormal vec-
tor, and κ is the curvature of the line. As the result, we
have the equation

Rt/A = [∇(ln ρ0(R)) × t] + κb,

(28)

applicability of which is not limited actually by the Eu-
lerian hydrodynamics. Let us indicate at least two more
physical models where the LIA equation (28) can be use-
ful.

The ﬁrst model is the theory of Bose-Einstein conden-
sation of a weakly non-ideal trapped gas. At zero tem-
perature this system is described approximately by the
complex order parameter Φ(r, t) (the wave function of
the condensate), with the equation of motion (the Gross-
Pitaevskii equation) taking in dimensionless variables the
form

iΦt = (cid:18)−

1
2

∆ + U (r) − µ + |Φ|2(cid:19) Φ,

(29)

where U (r) is the external potential, usually of the
quadratic form

U (r) =

ax2 + by2 + cz2

2

,

and the constant µ is the chemical potential. Let us sup-
pose a ≥ b ≥ c. It is well-known that the equation (29)
admits the hydrodynamical interpretation. The variables
ρ and p are deﬁned by the relations

ρ = |Φ|2,

ρp =

1
2i

(∇Φ · ¯Φ − Φ · ∇ ¯Φ).

The corresponding Hamiltonian is

HGP = Z (cid:20) (∇√ρ)2 + ρp2)

2

+ (U (r) − µ)ρ +

ρ2

2 (cid:21) dr.

In comparison with the ordinary Eulerian hydrodynam-
ics, there is the term depending on the density gradient
in this expression. However, with large values of the pa-
rameter µ2/a, one may neglect that term in calculation

if µ2 ≫ a, µ − U (r) > 0.

ρ0(r) ≈ µ − U (r),
As known, the equation (29) admits the solutions with
the quantized vortex ﬁlaments, the circulation around
them being equal to 2π. In these solutions, the density
diﬀers signiﬁcantly from ρ0(r) only at close distances of
order 1/√µ from the zero-line. Far away we have almost
Eulerian ﬂow. Therefore the LIA equation (28) is valid
for description of motion of quantum vortex ﬁlament in
trapped Bose-condensate of a relatively large size L ∼
pµ/a ≫ 1/√µ, with the parameter A = AGP

ln(cid:18) µ2

a (cid:19) .

AGP =

1
4

The second model is the electron magnetohydrody-
namics (EMHD), the Hamiltonian of which contains, be-
sides the kinetic energy, the energy of the magnetic ﬁeld
B created by the current of the electron ﬂuid through
the motionless non-homogeneous ion ﬂuid. In principle,
the Hamiltonian of EMHD is determined by the following
relations

rot v +

e
mc

B = Ω,

rot B =

4πe
mc

ρ0(r) · v,

HEM HD =

1

2 Z (cid:18)ρ0(r)v2 +

1
4π

B2(cid:19) dr,

where e is the electric charge of electron, m is its mass,
c is the light speed. In spatially homogeneous system we
would obtain that

Hh
EM HD =

ρ0

8π Z Z e−q|r1−r2|
|r1 − r2|

Ω(r1) · Ω(r2)dr1dr2,

where the screening parameter q is determined by the
relation

q2 =

4πρ0e2
m2c2 .

In the non-homogeneous system q is the function of co-
ordinates, with a typical value ˜q. Let us suppose the
inequality L˜q ≫ 1. It is clear that the logarithmic inte-
gral in the Hamiltonian is cut now not on the L, but on
the skin-depth λ = 1/q. Accordingly, for this case the
constant A in LIA equation (28) is given by the expres-
sion

AEM HD =

Γ
4π

ln(cid:18) mc

ed√˜ρ(cid:19) .

Let us note that in ideal EMHD the LIA works better
then in Eulerian hydrodynamics, due to the screening
eﬀect.

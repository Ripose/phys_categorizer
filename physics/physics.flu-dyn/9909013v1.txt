In previous work Majda29,30 and McLaughlin32,33 computed explicit expressions for the 2N th moments of a

passive scalar advected by a linear shear ﬂow in the form of an integral over RN . In this paper we ﬁrst compute

the asymptotics of these moments for large moment number. We are able to use this information about the large

N behavior of the moments, along with some basic facts about entire functions of ﬁnite order, to compute the

asymptotics of the tails of the probability distribution function. We ﬁnd that the probability distribution has

Gaussian tails when the energy is concentrated in the largest scales. As the initial energy is moved to smaller

and smaller scales we ﬁnd that the tails of the distribution grow longer, and the distribution moves smoothly

from Gaussian through exponential and “stretched exponential”. We also show that the derivatives of the scalar

are increasingly intermittent, in agreement with experimental observations, and relate the exponents of the scalar

derivative to the exponents of the scalar.

I. BACKGROUND

It is a well documented experimental fact that, while the statistics of the velocity ﬁeld in a turbulent

ﬂow are roughly Gaussian, the statistics of other quantities like the pressure, derivatives of velocity and

a passively advected scalar are generally far from Gaussian. [7,8,15,19,23,50] For example Castaing, et.

al. [8] observed in experiments in a Rayleigh-B´enard convection cell that for Rayleigh number Ra < 107

the distribution of temperature appeared to be roughly Gaussian, while for larger Rayleigh numbers,

Ra > 108, the temperature distribution appeared to be closer to exponential. In related work Ching [15]

studied the probability distribution functions (pdfs) for temperature diﬀerences at diﬀerent scales, again

in a Rayleigh-B´enard cell, and found that the pdfs over a wide range of scales were well approximated

by a ‘stretched exponential’ distributions of the form

1

P (T ) = e−C|T |β

.

At the smallest scales the observed value of the exponent was β ≈ .5, while at the largest scales the

observed exponent was roughly β ≈ 1.7. Kailasnath, Sreenivasan and Stolovitky [23] measured the

pdfs of velocity diﬀerences in the atmosphere for a wide range of separation scales. They found similar

distributions to the ones found by Ching, with exponents ranging from β ≈ .5 for separation distances

in the dissipative range to β ≈ 2 on the integral scale. Finally Thoroddsen and Van Atta [50] studied

thermally stratiﬁed turbulence in a wind tunnel and found the probability distributions of the density to

be roughly Gaussian, while the distributions of the density gradients were exponential.

A complete understanding of such intermittency lies at the heart of understanding ﬂuid turbulence, and

would certainly require a detailed understanding of the creation of small scale ﬂuid structures involving

both patchy regions of strong vorticity and intense gradients [17,49]. An alternative starting point is to

assume the statistics of the ﬂow are known a priori and to determine how these statistics are manifest in a

passively evolving quantity. This question of inherited statistics is signiﬁcantly easier than the derivation

of a complete theory for ﬂuid turbulence, though still retains many inherent diﬃculties such as problems

of closure.

Motivated by the Chicago experiments of the late 80’s [8], and earlier work [2,28,36,48], there has been a

tremendous eﬀort towards understand the origin of the intermittent temperature probability distribution

function in passive scalar models with prescribed (usually Gaussian) velocity statistics. For a very

complete review of the subject of turbulent diﬀusion, including a full discussion of scalar intermittency,

see the recent survey article of Majda and Kramer [31]. Most of the work on the scalar statistics has

either been directed at understanding the anomalous scaling of temperature structure functions, or at

understanding the shape of the tail of the limiting scalar pdf.

There has been a wealth of

theoretical

eﬀorts addressing this

last

issue of

the

tail

[3,5,8,10,11,14,16,18,20,34,25,24,29,30,32,37,38,43,45,46,52]. A somewhat common theme, particularly

in the pumped case, is the prediction that the scalar pdf should develop an exponential tail. For example

Kraichnan [25], Shraiman and Siggia [43] and Balkovsky and Falkovich [3] all ﬁnd exponential tails. An-

other important question is to understand the pdf of the scalar gradient. Naturally, gradient information

may be expected to amplify contributions from small scales, and a general theory relating the scalar

tail with the gradient tail, even for passively evolving quantities would be quite valuable. There has

2

been somewhat less theoretical eﬀort aimed at exploring the diﬀerence in statistics between the scalar

and the scalar gradient. Chertkov, Falkovich and Kolokolov [12], Chertkov Kolokolov and Vergassola

[13] and Balkovsky and Falkovich [3] have explored this question and have found a stretched exponential

distribution of the scalar gradient in situations for which the scalar has an exponential tail. Holzer and

Siggia [20,21], and Chen and Kraichnan [9] have observed similar phenomena numerically.

In this paper we examine the scalar and scalar gradient pdf tail in an exactly solvable model ﬁrst

studied by Majda [29] and McLaughlin and Majda [32] who were able to construct explicit moment

formulas for the moments of a passive scalar advected by a rapidly ﬂuctuating linear shear ﬂow in terms

of N -dimensional integrals. In that work, it was established that the degree of length scale separation

between the initial scalar ﬁeld and the ﬂuid ﬂow is inherent to the development of a broader than Gaussian

pdf.

Here, we explicitly calculate the tails of the pdf for this model. We begin by analyzing the expression

derived by Majda for the large time 2N th moment of the pdf for the random uniform shear model,

which is given by an integral over RN . From these normalized moments, we will construct the tail of

the associated pdf. We point out that in this calculation the convergence of the pdf for ﬁnite time to

the pdf for inﬁnite time is weak - for ﬁxed moment number the ﬁnite time moment converges to the

limiting moment. The convergence is almost certainly not uniform in the moments. For a more thorough

investigation of the uniformity of this limiting process in the context of general, bounded periodic shear

layers, see Bronski and McLaughlin [5].

The tail is calculated in two steps. First, using direct calculation and gamma function identities we are

able to reduce the N -dimensional integral to a single integral of Laplace type, from which the asymptotic

behavior of the 2N th moment follows easily. The asymptotic behavior of the moments is important for

determining the tails of the probability distribution function, as we establish below. Second, we consider

the problem of reconstructing the probability measure from the moments. Using ideas from complex

analysis, mainly some basic facts about entire functions of ﬁnite order and type, we are able to provide

rigorous estimates for the rate of decay of the tails of the measure. We ﬁnd that the tails decay like

so depending on the precise value of the parameter α (deﬁned in section II, below, which sets the degree of

scale separation between the scalar and ﬂow ﬁeld) the model admits tails which are Gaussian, exponential,

exp(−cα|T |

3+α )

or stretched exponential. We also show that in this model higher order derivatives of the scalar in the

shear direction are always more intermittent, with a very simple relationship between the exponents of

the scalar and its derivative. The distributions of derivatives in the cross-shear direction, however, display

the same tails as the scalar itself.

We remark that, while the stream-line topology for shear proﬁles is admittedly much simpler than

that in fully developed turbulence, the fact that the exact limiting tail for the decaying scalar ﬁeld may

be explicitly and rigorously constructed suggests such models to be exceptionally attractive for testing

the validity of diﬀerent perturbation schemes. It is also extremely interesting because it demonstrates

that, at least for unbounded ﬂows, a positive Lyapunov exponent (as would typically occur for a general

Batchelor ﬂow) is not necessary for intermittency. For an interesting discussion of the role of Lyapunov

exponents in producing intermittency see the work of Chertkov, Falkovich, Kolokolov and Lebedev. [14]

Here, we brieﬂy review the framework of the random shear model [29,30,32,5]. We follow Majda, and

consider the free evolution of a passive scalar ﬁeld in the presence of a rapidly ﬂuctuating shear proﬁle:

The random function, γ(t), represents multiplicative, mean zero Gaussian white noise, delta correlated

in time:

∂T

hγ(t)γ(s)i = δ(|t − s|)

where the brackets, h·i, denote the ensemble average over the statistics of γ(t). The original model

considered by Majda involved the case of a uniform shear layer, v(x) = x, which leads to the moments

considered below [29]. It a quite general fact, not special to shear proﬁles, that a closed evolution equation

for the arbitrary N-point correlator is available for the special case of rapidly ﬂuctuating Gaussian noise,

see work of Majda [30] for a path integral representation of this fact for the special case of random shear

layers. For the scalar evolving in (1), the N point correlator, deﬁned as:

where ∆2N denotes the 2N dimensional Laplacian.

We next describe the initial scalar ﬁeld. Following Majda [29], we assume that the scalar is initially a

mean zero, Gaussian random function depending only upon the variable, y:

dW (k)e2πiky|k|

α > −1

Here, ˆφ0(k) denotes a rapidly decaying (large k) cut-oﬀ function satisfying ˆφ0(k) = ˆφ(−k), ˆφ0(0) 6= 0 and

dW denotes complex Gaussian white noise with

hdW iW = 0

hdW (k)dW (η)iW = δ(k + η)dkdη

The spectral parameter, α appearing in (4) is introduced to adjust the excited length scales of the

initial scalar ﬁeld, with increasing α corresponding to initial data varying on smaller scales. We remark

that the more general case involving initial data depending upon both x and y, and data possessing both

mean and ﬂuctuating components, was analyzed McLaughlin and Majda [32].

For this case involving shear ﬂows, the evolution of this N point correlator may be immediately con-

verted to parabolic quantum mechanics through partial Fourier transformation in the y variable. For the

particular initial data presented in (4), this yields the following solution formula:

For the special case of a uniform, linear shear proﬁle, with v(x) = x, the quantum mechanics problem

in (5) is exactly solvable in any spatial dimension. Taking the ensemble average over the initial Gaussian

random measure using a standard cluster expansion, the general solution formula for hψN (x, y, t)iW

is obtained [29,32] in terms of N dimensional integrals. The normalized, long time ﬂatness factors,

and utilizing the explicit long time asymptotics available through Mehler’s formula. This leads to the

following set of normalized moments for the decaying scalar ﬁeld, T :

(6)

Observe that these normalized moments depend upon the parameter α. By varying this parameter

Majda and McLaughlin established that the degree of scale separation between the initial scalar and ﬂow

ﬁeld is important in the development of a broader than Gaussian pdf [29,32]. They demonstrated through

numerical quadrature of these integrals for low order moments that as the initial scalar ﬁeld develops

an infrared divergence (with α → −1, corresponding to the loss of scale separation between the initial

scalar ﬁeld, and the inﬁnitely correlated linear shear proﬁle) the limiting single point scalar distribution

has Gaussian moments [29]. Conversely they showed that as the length scale of the initial scalar ﬁeld

is reduced, corresponding to increasing values of α, the limiting distribution shows growing moments

indicative of a broad tailed distribution [32]. On the basis of these low order moment comparisons, these

studies suggest that within these models, the limiting pdf should be dependent upon the scale separation

between the scalar and ﬂow ﬁeld. A fundamental issue concerns whether and how this scale dependence is

manifest in the pdf tail. Below, we address precisely this issue, and rigorously establish that the intuition

put forth by Majda and McLaughlin is correct through the explicit calculation of the limiting pdf tail.

II. ASYMPTOTICS OF THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

A. Notation

Recall from the previous section that the work of Majda derived exact expressions for the moments

of a one parameter family of models indexed by the exponent α. In the remainder of the paper dµα(T )

will denote the probability measure for the passive scalar T in the Majda model with exponent α. The

ith moment of the probability measure dµα(T ) will be denoted by µα
i .

In this particular model the

distribution is symmetric and thus all odd moments vanish.

As noted by Majda cosh(|~k|) ≤

cosh(ki) which implies the normalized ﬂatness factors are strictly

larger than those of a Gaussian, implying broad tails. The simplest way to analyze this integral, and

in particular to understand the behavior for large N , is to introduce spherical coordinates. Spherical

coordinates in N dimensions can easily be constructed iteratively in terms of spherical coordinates in N −1

dimensions as follows. The coordinates in N dimensional spherical coordinates are {r, θ1, θ2, θ3 . . . θN −1}.

If {xN −1

coordinates is given by

θ1 ∈ [0, 2π]

θi>1 ∈ [0, π].

the moments are strictly larger than the moments of the Gaussian. We will use this to provide rigorous

quantitative estimates for the tails of the distribution.

C. The Hamburger moment problem

Having computed simple expressions for the moments of the pdf, as well as asymptotic expressions for

large moment number, it is natural to ask the question of whether one can do the inverse problem, and

deduce the pdf itself. The problem of determining a measure from its moments is a classical one, known

as the Hamburger moment problem [39,42,51]. This problem has a rich theory, and we mention only a

very few of the most basic results here. For an overview of the subject, see the book by Shohat and

Tamarkin [42] or the recent electronic preprint by Simon [44].

The two most important questions are, of course, existence and uniqueness. There is a necessary and

suﬃcient condition for a set of numbers {µi} to be the moments of some probability measure, namely that

the expectation of any positive polynomial be positive. This translates into the following linear algebraic

conditions on the diagonal determinants of the Hankel matrix, the matrix with i, jth entry µi+j:

These conditions appear to be quite diﬃcult to check in practice. However since the moments considered

here are, by construction, the moments of a pdf this condition must hold.

A more subtle question is the issue of uniqueness of the measure, usually called determinacy in the

literature of the moment problem. One classical suﬃcient condition for the determinacy of the moment

problem is the following condition, due to Carleman [6,42]: If the moments µn are such that the following

sum diverges

then the Hamburger moment problem is determinate. Given the asymptotic expression for the moments

given in Equation (10) it is easy to check that

and thus there is a unique measure with these moments for −1 ≤ α ≤ 1. We will see later that this

corresponds to probability distribution functions with tails that range from Gaussian through exponential.

In the case α > 1 which, as we will see later, corresponds to stretched exponential tails, the problem

probably does not have a unique solution. Indeed there are classical examples of collections of moments

with the same asymptotic behavior as the stretched exponential distribution for which the moment

problem has a whole family of solutions.

Given this we come to the question of actually calculating the measure given the moments. There

is a rather involved theory for this in the determinate case involving, among other things, orthogonal

polynomials and continued fractions [27,42], but in general this problem is extremely diﬃcult. However

we show in the next section that it is relatively straightforward to reconstruct the tails of the measure

from the moments.

D. Asymptotics of the tails of the distribution

Recall that µα

2N is the 2N th moment of some probability measure dµα(T ),

We are interested in calculating the asymptotic rate of decay of the tails of the probability measure dµα(T ).

The information about the behavior of the tails of the distribution is contained in the asymptotic behavior

of the large moments. We study the tails of the measure dµα(T ) by introducing the function

µα

2N =

T 2N dµα(T ).

where C is some as yet unspeciﬁed constant. The factor of Γ( j(3+α)

) is chosen so that the series for f α

2

has a ﬁnite but non-zero radius of convergence. This will give us the sharpest control over the tails of

dµα(T ). It is convenient to demand that the radius of convergence of the series be one. Using the root

test it is straightforward to check that the radius of convergence of the sum is given by

We note a few simple facts. First notice that the function f α(z) is a kind of generalized Laplace transform

for all z and thus F α(zT ) is an entire function of the complex variable z. Further we know that the

P

integral must converge for |z| < 1 and diverge for some |z| > 1, since the original series converged in a

circle of unit radius. We note that the entire function F α(z) satisﬁes

so the function F α(z) grows fastest along the real axis. Thus we know that the integral in Equation (14)

converges for −1 < z < 1 and diverges for z > 1, z < −1. Thus the problem of understanding the rate of

decay of the tails of the probability measure dµα(T ) has been reduced to that of determining the rate of

growth of the function F (zt). There is a well-developed theory for studying the rate of growth of entire

functions, the theory of entire functions of ﬁnite order. We recall only the basic facts here - the interested

reader is referred to the texts of Ahlfors [1] and Rubel with Colliander [40].

The radial maximal function MF (r) of an entire function F (z) is deﬁned to be the maximum of the

absolute value of F over a ball of radius r centered on the origin:

MF (r) = max
|z|=r

|F (z)|

11

The order ρ of a function F is deﬁned to be

ρ = lim sup

r→∞

log+ log+ MF (r)
log+(r)

,

where log+(x) = max(0, log(x)), if this limit exists. It is easy to see from this deﬁnition that F is of

order ρ means that F grows asymptotically like exp(A(z)|z|ρ) along the direction of maximum growth in

the complex plane, where A(z) grows more slowly than any power of z. A related notion is the type of a

function of ﬁnite order. If F is of order ρ then the type τ is deﬁned to be

τ = lim sup

r→∞

log+ MF (r)
rρ

when this limit exists. Again speaking very roughly the type τ gives the next order asymptotics: if F is

of order ρ and type τ then F grows like B(z) exp(τ |z|ρ), where B(z) is subdominant to the exponential

term. Note that by Equation (17) the function F α grows fastest along the real axis, and thus the maximal

rate of growth in the complex plane is exactly the rate of growth along the real axis.

There exist alternate characterizations of the order and type of a function in terms of the Taylor

coeﬃcients An which are very useful for our purposes. These are given as follows:

ρ = lim sup

τ = lim sup

III. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Physically the Majda model can be thought of as a model for the behavior of a passive scalar at small

scales, when the scale of the ﬂow ﬁeld is much larger than the scale of the variations of the scalar. Recall

that the random scalar is given by

T (y) =

In the limit as α approaches −1 there is an infrared divergence, so that the energy of the scalar is

concentrated at larger and larger scales. In this case

4
3+α → 2, so the normalized distribution function

becomes Gaussian, as was originally observed by Majda.

One important fact about this model which we would like to emphasize is that it predicts that higher

derivatives of the advected scalar should be increasingly intermittent, a fact which was not strongly

emphasized in previous work. Observe that due to the special nature of shear ﬂows the scalar derivative

∂T /∂y satisﬁes the same equation as the scalar T with no additional terms!. We further note that the

initial condition for the derivative of the scalar is given by

so the derivative of the scalar has a representation of the same form as the representation of the scalar

itself, but with the exponent α increased by two, and a slightly modiﬁed φ0(k). Recall that the exponent

α determines the amount of energy at the largest scales and thus the degree of intermittency, with the tails

decaying as exp(−T 4/(3+α)). Our calculation shows that increasing α increases the width of the tails of

the probability distribution function, implying that derivatives are more intermittent! These predictions

for the behavior of the tails of the scalar as compared with the scalar gradient are in extremely good

agreement with experimental and numerical results. For instance our calculation shows that if the scalar

has exponent α = −1, so that the probability distribution function of the scalar has Gaussian tails, then

the derivative of the scalar has exponent α = 1, implying that the distribution of the derivative has

exponential tails. This agrees quite well with the experiments of Van Atta and Thorddsen [50], as just

one example, who observe that in turbulent thermally stratiﬁed ﬂow that the pdf for the density has

Gaussian tails, while the pdf of the density gradient has exponential tails. Similarly if the scalar has

exponent α = 1, so that the distribution of the scalar itself is exponential, then derivative of the scalar

should have exponent 2

3 . This agrees with the calculations of Chertkov, Falkovich and Kolokolov [12],

and Balkovsky and Falkovich [3] also predict exponential tails for the scalar and stretched exponential

tails with exponent 2

3 for the scalar gradient in the Batchelor regime. This also shows reasonably good

agreement with the numerical experiments of Holzer and Siggia [20,21]. In their experiments Holzer and

Siggia ﬁnd that a scalar with exponential tails has a gradient with stretched exponential tails. For large

Peclet number the exponent of these stretched exponential tails is in the range of .661 − .563.

Of course one can eliminate α entirely, and one ﬁnds the following relationship between the distribution

of the scalar and the scalar gradient within this model.

If T is distributed according to a stretched

exponential pdf with exponent ρ, and the gradient Ty according to a stretched exponential pdf with

exponent ρ′, then ρ, ρ′ are related by

It would be extremely interesting to check if this relationship, or some generalization of it, holds in greater

generality than shear ﬂows. The above numerical and experimental evidence suggest that this might not

be an unreasonable hope.

The distribution of the x, or cross-shear, derivatives can also be calculated using the same explicit

representations derived by Majda. Calculations by the authors for deterministic initial data have shown

that derivatives in the cross-shear direction have a distribution with the same asymptotic behavior as

the scalar itself. This should be compared to and contrasted with the papers of Son [46], and Balkovsky

and Fouxon [4], which predict distributions with very broad tails (all of the higher moments diverge as

t → ∞) and which predicts the same distribution for derivatives of the scalar as for the scalar itself.

We would also like to comment on the relationship between intermittency and the Lyapunov exponents

of the underlying ﬂow ﬁeld. A number of papers have addressed the problem of intermittency in the large

Peclet number limit by attempting to relate broader than Gaussian tails to the Lyapnuov exponents of

the ﬂow ﬁeld [14]. It is worth noting that a shear ﬂow does not possess a positive Lyapunov exponent,

but as we have shown here a shear ﬂow can generate exponential and stretched exponential tails in the

passive scalar. This shows that chaotic behavior in the underlying ﬂow, while probably an important

eﬀect in realistic ﬂows, is not necessary for the generation of broad tails and intermittency.

Finally we would like to comment on the rate of approach to the limiting measure in time. The results

presented here analyze the inﬁnite time limit of the measure. As mentioned earlier the convergence to

this limiting measure is expected to be highly non-uniform. A preliminary calculation by the authors for

a special choice of the cut-oﬀ function ˆφ0(k) suggests that for large but ﬁnite times the pdf looks like the

pdf for the inﬁnite time problem in some core region, with Gaussian tails outside this core region. As

time increases the size of this core region demonstrating non-Gaussian statistics grows, and the Gaussian

tails get pushed out to inﬁnity. We believe this same picture to hold for any choice of the cut-oﬀ function

ˆφ0(k), but more work is needed to establish this fact.

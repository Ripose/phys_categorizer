We consider pressure-driven, steady state Poiseuille ﬂow in straight channels with various cross-
sectional shapes: elliptic, rectangular, triangular, and harmonic-perturbed circles. A given shape is
characterized by its perimeter P and area A which are combined into the dimensionless compactness
number C = P 2
/A, while the hydraulic resistance is characterized by the well-known dimensionless
geometrical correction factor α. We ﬁnd that α depends linearly on C, which points out C as a
single dimensionless measure characterizing ﬂow properties as well as the strength and eﬀectiveness
of surface-related phenomena central to lab-on-a-chip applications. This measure also provides a
simple way to evaluate the hydraulic resistance for the various shapes.

INTRODUCTION

The rapid development in the ﬁeld of lab-on-a-chip
systems during the past decade has put emphasis on
studies of shape-dependence in microﬂuidic channels.
Traditionally, capillary tubes would have circular cross-
sections, but today microfabricated channels have a va-
riety of shapes depending on the fabrication technique
in use. Examples are rectangular channels obtained by
hot embossing in polymer wafers, semi-circular channels
in isotropically etched surfaces, triangular channels in
KOH-etched silicon crystals, Gaussian-shaped channels
in laser-ablated polymer ﬁlms, and elliptic channels in
stretched PDMS devices, see e.g., Ref. 1.

The pressure-driven, steady-state ﬂow of a liquid
through long, straight, and rigid channels of any constant
cross-sectional shape is referred to as Hagen–Poiseuille
(or simply Poiseuille) ﬂow, and it is often characterized
by the hydraulic resistance, Rhyd = ∆p/Q, where ∆p
is the pressure drop along the channel and Q the ﬂow
rate through the channel. In Fig. 1 is shown an arbitrar-
ily shaped cross-section Ω in the xy plane for a straight
channel placed along the z axis. A natural unit for the

numerically from Eq. (3) by a ﬁnite-element method. The
velocity is zero at the boundary and maximal near the centre-
of-mass.

as well as the cross-section area. This dependence can
therefore be characterized by the dimensionless geomet-

In lab-on-a-chip applications [1, 2], where large surface-
to-volume ratios are encountered, the problem of the
bulk Poiseuille ﬂow is typically accompanied by other
surface-related physical or bio-chemical phenomena in
the ﬂuid. The list of examples includes surface chemistry,
DNA hybridization on ﬁxed targets, catalysis, interfacial
electrokinetic phenomena such as electro-osmosis, elec-
trophoresis and electro-viscous eﬀects as well as contin-
uous edge-source diﬀusion. Though the phenomena are
of very diﬀerent nature, they have at least one thing in
common; they are all to some degree surface phenomena
and their strength and eﬀectiveness depends strongly on
the surface-to-volume ratio.
It is common to quantify
this by the dimensionless compactness

thus point out a uniﬁed dimensionless measure of ﬂow
properties as well as the strength and eﬀectiveness of
surface-related phenomena central to lab-on-a-chip ap-
plications. Furthermore, our results allow for an easy

II. POISEUILLE FLOW

Due to translation invariance along the z axis the ve-
locity ﬁeld of a Newtonian ﬂuid in a straight channel is
parallel to the z axis, and takes the form v = v(x, y)ez.
Consequently, the non-linear term in the Navier–Stokes
equation drops out [4], and in steady-state, given the
(∆p/L)ez, the velocity v(x, y) is thus
pressure gradient
given by the Poisson equation,

with the velocity being subject to a no-slip condition at
the boundary ∂Ω. The relation between the pressure

rection factor α becomes

III. THE GEOMETRICAL CORRECTION
FACTOR VERSUS COMPACTNESS

Our main objective is to ﬁnd the relation between the

geometrical correction factor α and the compactness
for various families of geometries.

A. Elliptical cross section

The elliptical family of cross-sections is special in the
sense that Eq. (3) can solved analytically (see e.g. Ref. 4)
and we can get an explicit expression for the geometrical
correction factor introduced in Eq. (1). For an ellipse
centered at the origin with semi-major and minor axes a
and b it can be veriﬁed by direct insertion that

the exact results, and the dashed lines indicate Eqs. (9), (14),

are also included (◦, (cid:3), and △). Note that in the case of
triangles all classes (right, isosceles, and acute/obtuse scalene
triangles — marked by diﬀerent grayscale triangles) fall on
the same straight line.

By selecting the proper root we get γ(α) which we then
substitute into Eq. (7) such that

a numerical ﬁnite-element solution of Eq. (3) are also
included ((cid:3) points). As in the elliptical case, there is
as described by
a close-to-linear dependence of α on
Eq. (14).

C. Triangular shape

For the equilateral triangle it can be shown analytically
= 12√3, see e.g. Ref. 4. However,
that α = 20√3 and
in the general case of a triangle with side lengths a, b,
and c we are referred to numerical solutions of Eq. (3).
In Fig. 2 we show numerical results (
points), from
ﬁnite-element simulations, for scaling of right triangles,
isosceles triangles, and acute/obtuse scalene triangles (for
the deﬁnitions we refer to Ref. 6). The dashed line shows

where the slope is obtained from a numerical ﬁt and sub-
sequent use of the ﬁrst three terms in the continued frac-
tion of this value. As seen, the results for diﬀerent classes
of triangles fall onto the same straight line. Since we have

FIG. 3: (a) The geometry of the unperturbed and analyti-
cally solvable cross section, the unit circle, described by co-
ordinates (˜x, ˜y) or (ρ, θ). (b) The geometry of the perturbed
cross section described by coordinates (x, y) or (r, φ) and the
perturbation parameter ǫ. Here a = 1, k = 5 and ǫ = 0.2.

D. Harmonically perturbed circle

By use of shape perturbation theory it is possible to
extend the analytical results for Poiseuille ﬂow beyond
the few cases of regular geometries that we have treated
above. In shape perturbation theory the starting point
is an analytically solvable case, which then is deformed
slightly characterized by some small perturbation param-
eter ǫ. As illustrated in Fig. 3 the unperturbed shape is
described by parametric coordinates (˜x, ˜y) in Cartesian
form or (ρ, θ) in polar form. The coordinates of the phys-
ical problem we would like to solve are (x, y) in Cartesian
form and (r, φ) in polar form.

As a concrete example we take the harmonic pertur-

bation of the circle deﬁned by the transformation

It is desirable to formulate the perturbed Poiseuille prob-
lem using the unperturbed coordinates. To obtain ana-
lytical results it is important to make the appearance of
the perturbation parameter explicit. When performing a
perturbation calculation to order m all terms containing
ǫl with l > m are discarded, while the remaining terms

(cid:1)

containing the same power of ǫ are grouped together, and
the equations are solved power by power.

To carry out the perturbation calculation the velocity

v(x, y) is written as

v(x, y) = v

x[ρ, θ], y[ρ, θ]

= v(0)(ρ, θ) + ǫ v(1)(ρ, θ) + ǫ2 v(2)(ρ, θ) +

(cid:0)

Likewise, the Laplacian operator in Eq. (3) must be ex-
pressed in terms of ρ, θ, and ǫ. The starting point of this
transformation is the transformation of the gradients

∂r = (∂rρ) ∂ρ + (∂rθ) ∂θ,
∂φ = (∂φρ) ∂ρ + (∂φθ) ∂θ.

(20a)
(20b)

The derivatives (∂rρ), (∂rθ), (∂φρ), and (∂φθ) are ob-
tained from the inverse transformation of Eqs. (17a) and
(17b). The expansion in Eq. (19) can now be inserted
into Eq. (3) and by use of the derivatives, Eqs. (20a)
and (20b), we can carry out the perturbation scheme.
The calculation of the velocity ﬁeld to fourth order is
straightforward, but tedious. With the velocity ﬁeld at
hand we can calculate the ﬂow rate and from Eq. (4) we
get

ner whereas a concave parabolic dependence is generally
found if the boundary has a sharp corner (this can be
proved explicitly for the equilateral triangle [4]). Since
the concave drop is associated with a region of low veloc-
ity compared to the convex drop, geometries with sharp
changes in the boundary tend to have a higher hydraulic
resistance compared to smooth geometries with equiva-
lent cross-sectional area.

We believe that the explicit and simple link between

ness of various surface-related phenomena. We note that
in micro-channels the ﬂow properties and electrokinetic
phenomena may be somewhat connected and substan-
tial deviations from classical Poiseuille ﬂow have been
reported recently, see Ref. 7 and references therein. Nev-
ertheless, our observation is an important ﬁrst step with
relevance to the use of micro-ﬂuidic channels in lab-on-
a-chip applications. Furthermore, our results allow for
an easy evaluation of the hydraulic resistance for ellip-
tical, rectangular, and triangular cross-sections with the

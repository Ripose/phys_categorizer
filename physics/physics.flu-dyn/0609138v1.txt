Abstract

The seemingly simple problem of determining the drag on a body moving through

a very viscous ﬂuid has, for over 150 years, been a source of theoretical confu-

sion, mathematical paradoxes, and experimental artifacts, primarily arising from

the complex boundary layer structure of the ﬂow near the body and at inﬁnity.

We review the extensive experimental and theoretical literature on this problem,

with special emphasis on the logical relationship between diﬀerent approaches. The

survey begins with the developments of matched asymptotic expansions, and con-

cludes with a discussion of perturbative renormalization group techniques, adapted

from quantum ﬁeld theory to diﬀerential equations. The renormalization group

calculations lead to a new prediction for the drag coeﬃcient, one which can both

reproduce and surpass the results of matched asymptotics.

In 1851, shortly after writing down the eponymous Navier-Stokes equations, Sir George

Gabriel Stokes turned his attention to what modern researchers might whimsically refer to

as “the hydrogen atom” of ﬂuid mechanics: the determination of the drag on a sphere or

an inﬁnite cylinder moving at ﬁxed speed in a highly viscous ﬂuid (Stokes, 1851). Just

as the quantum theory of the hydrogen atom entailed enormous mathematical diﬃculties,

ultimately leading to the development of quantum ﬁeld theory, the problem posed by Stokes

has turned out to be much harder than anyone could reasonably have expected: it took over

100 years to obtain a justiﬁable lowest order approximate solution, and that achievement

required the invention of a new branch of applied mathematics, matched asymptotic expan-

sions. And just as the ﬁne structure of the hydrogen atom’s spectral lines eventually required

renormalization theory to resolve the problems of “inﬁnities” arising in the theory, so too,

Stokes’ problem is plagued by divergences that are, to a physicist, most naturally resolved

by renormalization group theory (Chen et al., 1996; Feynman, 1948; Gell-Mann and Low,

1954; Schwinger, 1948; Stuckelberg and Petermann, 1953; Tomonaga, 1948; Wilson, 1971a,b,

1983).

In order to appreciate the fundamental diﬃculty of such problems, and to expose the

3

similarity with familiar problems in quantum electrodynamics, we need to explain how

perturbation theory is used in ﬂuid dynamics. Every ﬂow that is governed by the Navier-

Stokes equations only (i.e.

the transport of passive scalars, such as temperature, is not

considered; there are no rotating frames of reference or other complications) is governed by

a single dimensionless parameter, known as the Reynolds number, which we designate as R.

The Reynolds number is a dimensionless number made up of a characteristic length scale L,

a characteristic velocity of the ﬂow U, and the kinematic viscosity ν ≡ η/ρ, where η is the

viscosity and ρ is the density of the ﬂuid. In the problems at hand, deﬁned precisely below,

the velocity scale is the input ﬂuid velocity at inﬁnity, u∞, and the length scale is the radius

a of the body immersed in the ﬂuid. Then the Reynolds number is given by:

R ≡

u∞a
ν

.

(1)

The Reynolds number is frequently interpreted as the ratio of the inertial to viscous terms

in the Navier-Stokes equations. For very viscous ﬂows, R → 0, and so we anticipate that

a sensible way to proceed is perturbation theory in R about the problems with inﬁnite

viscosity, i.e. R = 0. In this respect, the unwary reader might regard this as an example

very similar to quantum electrodynamics, where the small parameter is the ﬁne structure

constant. However, as we will see in detail below, there is a qualitative diﬀerence between

a ﬂow with R = 0 and a ﬂow with R → 0. The fundamental reason is that by virtue of

the circular or spherical geometry, the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the Navier-Stokes

equations is not a constant everywhere in space: it varies as a function of radial distance r

from the body, scaling as O (Rr/a). Thus, when R = 0, this term is everywhere zero; but

for any non-zero R, as r/a → ∞ the ratio of inertial to viscous forces becomes arbitrarily

large. Thus, inertial forces can not legitimately be regarded as negligible with respect to

viscous forces everywhere. In summary, the basic premise, on which perturbation theory is

built, is not valid.

Perturbation theory has to somehow express, or manifest, this fact, and it registers its

objection by generating divergent terms in its expansion. These divergences are not physical,

but are the perturbation theory’s way of indicating that the zeroth order solution—the point

about which perturbation theory proceeds—is not a correct starting point. The reader

might wonder if the precise nature of the breakdown of perturbation theory, signiﬁed by the

divergences, can be used to deduce what starting point would be a valid one. The answer is

4

yes: this procedure is known as the perturbative renormalization group (RG), and we will

devote a signiﬁcant fraction of this article to expounding this strategy. However, historically,

this was not so obvious to workers, and a diﬀerent strategy was followed, known generically

as singular perturbation theory, with particular emphasis on boundary layer theory and the

method of matched asymptotic expansions. We will devote a signiﬁcant fraction of this

article to explaining these techniques, developed by mathematicians starting in the 1950’s,

and showing their connection with renormalization group methods.

As most readers will know, renormalization (Feynman, 1948; Schwinger, 1948; Tomonaga,

1948) and renormalization group (Gell-Mann and Low, 1954; Stuckelberg and Petermann,

1953; Wilson, 1971a,b, 1983) techniques in quantum ﬁeld theories have been stunningly suc-

cessful. In the most well-controlled case, that of quantum electrodynamics, the smallness of

the ﬁne structure constant allows agreement of perturbative calculations with high-precision

measurements to 12 signiﬁcant ﬁgures (Gabrielse et al., 2006). How well do the correspond-

ing techniques work in low Reynolds ﬂuid dynamics, where one wishes to calculate and

measure the drag CD (deﬁned precisely below)? The answer is somewhat diﬀerent in this

case, because it is the functional form in R for the drag that is of interest, rather than the

drag at one particular value of R.

With the calculational techniques of matched asymptotic expansions widely regarded as

representing a systematically ﬁrm footing, the best results apply only to inﬁnitesimally small

Reynolds number. Ian Proudman, who, in a tour de force helped obtain the ﬁrst matched

asymptotics result for a sphere (Proudman and Pearson, 1957), expressed it this way: “It is

therefore particularly disappointing that the numerical ‘convergence’ of the expansion is so

poor.” (Chester and Breach, 1969) In spite of its failings, Proudman’s solution from 1959

was the ﬁrst mathematically rigorous one; all preceding theoretical eﬀorts were worse.

All solutions to this problem involve approximations which are not always rigorous or

explicitly stated. To make matters worse, this ﬁeld is rife with historical confusion, dis-

agreements over attribution, mysterious factors of two, conﬂicting terminology, non-standard

deﬁnitions, and language barriers. Even a recent article attempting to resolve this quagmire

(Lindgren, 1999) contains inaccuracies regarding publication dates and scientiﬁc priority.

This tortured history has left a wake of experiments and numerical calculations which are of

widely varying quality, although they can appear to agree when not examined closely. For

example, it turns out that the ﬁnite size of experimental systems has a dramatic eﬀect on

5

measurements and simulations, a problem not appreciated by early workers.

The renormalization group approach to this problem is somewhat more encouraging. As

we will see, it generates a non-trivial estimate for the functional form of CD(R) that can

be sensibly used at moderate values of R ∼ O (1), not just inﬁnitesimal values of R; and

for inﬁnitesimal values of R, it reproduces correctly the previously-known results for CD

obtained by matched asymptotic expansions, in particular accounting for the nature of the

mathematical singularities that must be assumed to be present for the asymptotic matching

procedure to be carried out.

This review has two main purposes. The ﬁrst purpose of the present article is to attempt

a review and synthesis of the literature, suﬃciently detailed that the subtle diﬀerences

between diﬀerent approaches are exposed, and can be evaluated by the reader. This is

especially important, because this is one of those problems so detested by students, in which

there are a myriad of ways to achieve the right answer for the wrong reasons. This article

highlights all of these.

A second purpose of this article is to review the use of renormalization group tech-

niques in the context of singular perturbation theory, as applied to low Reynolds number

ﬂows. Renormalization group techniques were originally developed in the 1950’s to extend

and improve the perturbation theory for quantum electrodynamics. During the late 1960’s

and 1970’s, renormalization group techniques famously found application in the problem

of phase transitions (Kadanoﬀ, 1966; Widom, 1965; Wilson, 1971a,b, 1983). During the

1990’s, renormalization group techniques were developed for ordinary and partial diﬀer-

ential equations, at ﬁrst for the analysis of nonequilibrium (but deterministic) problems

which exhibited anomalous scaling exponents (Chen et al., 1991; Goldenfeld et al., 1990)

and subsequently for the related problem of travelling wave selection (Chen and Goldenfeld,

1995; Chen et al., 1994a,c). The most recent signiﬁcant development of the renormalization

group—and the one that concerns us here—was the application to singular perturbation

problems (Chen et al., 1994b, 1996). The scope of (Chen et al., 1996) encompasses bound-

ary layer theory, matched asymptotic expansions, multiple scales analysis, WKB theory, and

reductive perturbation theory for spatially-extended dynamical systems. We do not review

all these developments here, but focus only on the issues arising in the highly pathological

singularities characteristic of low Reynolds number ﬂows. For a pedagogical introduction to

renormalization group techniques, we refer the reader to (Goldenfeld, 1992). We mention

6

also that the RG techniques discussed here have also been the subject of rigorous analysis

(Blomker et al., 2002; Bricmont and Kupiainen, 1995; Bricmont et al., 1994; Lan and Lin,

2004; Moise et al., 1998; Moise and Temam, 2000; Moise and Ziane, 2001; Petcu et al., 2005;

Wirosoetisno et al., 2002; Ziane, 2000) in other contexts of ﬂuid dynamics, and have

also found application in cavitation (Josserand, 1999) and cosmological ﬂuid dynamics

(Belinchon et al., 2002; Iguchi et al., 1998; Nambu, 2000, 2002; Nambu and Yamaguchi,

This review is organized as follows. We begin by reviewing all prior theoretical and

experimental results. We identify the ﬁve calculations and measurements which are ac-

curate enough, and which extend to suﬃciently small Reynolds number, to be useful for

evaluating theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we review the history of all theoretical

contributions, and clearly present the methodologies and approximations behind previous

solutions.

In doing so, we eliminate all confusion over chronology and attribution. We

conclude by comparing the best experimental results with our “state-of-the-art” RG-based

theoretical prediction. This exercise makes the shortcomings that Proudman lamented all

1999).

too clear.

These theoretical attempts are littered with “paradoxes”, revisions, ad-hoc justiﬁcations,

and failures. These problems arise because the governing equations are singular in the limit

of zero Reynolds number. This singularity results in a boundary layer at inﬁnity, a prob-

lem which was not resolved until matched asymptotics (Bender and Orzag, 1999). Recently,

techniques based on perturbative renormalization group have emerged as an alternative to

matched asymptotic and multiple scales (Chen et al., 1994b, 1996). These techniques, in

contrast to earlier methods, require neither assumptions about the structure of the pertur-

bation series nor asymptotic matching. They have been used to obtain superior approxi-

mate solutions to (for example) the Swift-Hohenberg equation, which is used as a model

of Rayleigh-Benard convection (Chen et al., 1996). However, until now these techniques

had not been applied to the low Reynolds numbers problem which gave birth to matched

asymptotics. Our work shows that RG techniques yield economical expansions and superior

solutions to these classic problems.

In this and the following section, we begin a reexamination of the historical problem of

determining the steady state solutions for the ﬂow of a uniform stream past ﬁxed bodies.

In particular, we study ﬂow past a sphere and an inﬁnite cylinder. We assume the ﬂuid to

7

be incompressible, and work in the low Reynolds number regime (R ≈ 0), with the goal of

calculating the drag force exerted on the ﬁxed body. The actual physical problem concerns

a body moving at constant velocity in an inﬁnite ﬂuid, where the ﬂuid is at rest in the

laboratory frame. In practice, it is more convenient to analyze the problem using an inertial

frame moving with the ﬁxed body, an approach which is entirely equivalent.1

This is a classic problem, with an extensive literature dating back to 1851, when Stokes

analyzed ﬂow past a sphere and a cylinder using perturbative expansions in the Reynolds

number (Stokes, 1851). He obtained a ﬁrst order approximation for the drag on a sphere,

but was unable to obtain a solution for the cylinder, a failure referred to as Stokes’ paradox.

In 1889, Whitehead found that no second order approximation could be found for ﬂow past

a sphere, a failure known as Whitehead’s paradox. These complications arise because the

Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the ﬂow, constitute a singular perturbation problem

(with respect to small Reynolds numbers).

In the early 1950s, a solution of these problems led to the development of a new branch

of applied mathematics known as matched asymptotics. However, the best current matched

asymptotic results have deﬁciencies, as can be seen from Figure 1. This plot compares

experimental measurements and theoretically predicted drag coeﬃcients as a function of

the Reynolds number. Large deviations for R ∼ 0.5 demonstrate the need for theoretical

predictions which are more robust for small but non-inﬁnitesimal Reynolds numbers.

Although in principle the matched asymptotics results can be systematically extended

by working to higher order, this is not practical. The complexity of the governing equations

prohibits further improvement. Here we show that techniques based on the renormalization

group ameliorate some of the technical diﬃculties, and result in a more accurate drag coef-

ﬁcient at small but non-inﬁnitesimal Reynolds numbers. Given the historical importance of

the techniques developed to solve these problems, we anticipate that our solutions will be

of general methodological interest.

1 Nearly all workers, beginning with Stokes (Stokes, 1851), use this approach, which Lindgren (Lindgren,

1999) refers to as the “steady” ﬂow problem.

A. Mathematical formulation of the problem

Flow past a sphere or circle is shown schematically in Figure 2. The body has a char-

acteristic length scale, which we have chosen to be the radius (a), and it is immersed in

uniform stream of ﬂuid. At large distances, the undisturbed ﬂuid moves with velocity ~u∞.

The quantities shown in Table I characterize the problem. We assume incompressible ﬂow,

so ρ = const. The continuity equation (Eqn. 2) and the time-independent Navier-Stokes

equations (Eqn. 3) govern steady-state, incompressible ﬂow.

These equations must be solved subject to two boundary conditions, given in Eqn. 4. First,

the no-slip conditions are imposed on the surface of the ﬁxed body (Eqn. 4a). Secondly, the

ﬂow must be a uniform stream far from the body (Eqn. 4b). To calculate the pressure, one

also needs to specify an appropriate boundary condition (Eqn. 4c), although as a matter

of practice this is immaterial, as only pressure diﬀerences matter when calculating the drag

coeﬃcient.

It is convenient to analyze the problem using non-dimensional quantities, which are de-

ﬁned in Table II. When using dimensionless variables, the governing equations assume the

1. Flow past a cylinder

For the problem of the inﬁnite cylinder, it is natural to use cylindrical coordinates, ~r =

(r, θ, z). We examine the problem where the uniform ﬂow is in the ˆx direction (see Figure

2). We will look for 2-d solutions, which satisfy ∂z~u = 0.

Since the problem is two dimensional, one may reduce the set of governing equations

(Eqns. 5 and 6) to a single equation involving a scalar quantity, the Lagrangian stream

function, usually denoted ψ(r, θ). It is deﬁned by Eqn. 8.2

ur =

uθ = −

This deﬁnition guarantees that equation (5) will be satisﬁed (Goldstein, 1929). Substi-

tuting the stream function into equation (7), one obtains the governing equation (Eqn.

9). Here we follow the compact notation of Proudman and Pearson (Hinch, 1991;

Proudman and Pearson, 1957).

To calculate the drag for on a cylinder, we must ﬁrst solve Equation 9 subject to the

boundary conditions given in Eqn. 10.

2. Flow past a sphere

To study ﬂow past a sphere, we use spherical coordinates: ~r = (r, θ, φ). We take the

uniform ﬂow to be in the ˆz direction. Consequently, we are interested in solutions which are

independent of φ, because there can be no circulation about the ˆz axis.

Since the problem has axial symmetry, one can use the Stokes’ stream function (or Stokes’

current function) to reduce Eqns. 5 and 6 to a single equation. The stream function is deﬁned

through the following relations:

vr =

These deﬁnitions guarantee that Eqn. 5 will be satisﬁed. Substituting Eqn. 11 into Eqn. 7,

one obtains the governing equation for ψ(r, θ) (Proudman and Pearson, 1957):

Other authors, such as Van Dyke (Van Dyke, 1975) and Hinch (Hinch, 1991), write their

stream function equations in an equivalent, albeit less compact, notation.

As in the case of the cylinder, the boundary conditions which ﬁx ~u(~r) (Eqns. 4a, 4b)

determine ψ up to an irrelevant additive constant. The transformed boundary conditions

are given by Eqn. 14.

In this paper, we obtain approximate solutions for Eqn. 9 (subject to Eqn. 10), and Eqn.

12 (subject to Eqn. 14). These solutions are then used to calculate drag coeﬃcients, which

we compare to experimental results.

3. Calculating the drag coeﬃcient

Once the Navier-Stokes equations have been solved, and the stream function is known,

calculating the drag coeﬃcient, CD, is a mechanical procedure. We follow the methodology

described by Chester and Breach (Chester and Breach, 1969). This analysis is consistent

with the work done by Kaplun (Kaplun, 1957) and Proudman (Proudman and Pearson,

1957), although these authors do not detail their calculations.

This methodology is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that employed by other workers, such as

Tomotika (Oseen, 1910; Tomotika and Aoi, 1950). Tomotika calculates CD approximately,

based on a linearized calculation of pressure. Although these approximations are consistent

with the approximations inherent in their solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, they are

inadequate for the purposes of obtaining a systematic approximation to any desired order

of accuracy.

Calculating the drag on the body begins by determining the force exerted on the body

by the moving ﬂuid. Using dimensional variables, the force per unit area is given by

(Landau and Lifschitz, 1999):

Pi = −σiknk

(15)

13

Here σik is the stress tensor, and ~n is a unit vector normal to the surface. For an incom-

pressible ﬂuid, the stress tensor takes the form (Landau and Lifschitz, 1999):

σik = −pδik + η(

∂vi
∂xk

+

∂vk
∂xi

)

(16)

η is the dynamic viscosity, related to the kinematic viscosity by η = νρ. The total force is

found by integrating Eqn. 15 over the surface of the solid body. We now use these relations

to derive explicit formula, expressed in terms of stream functions, for both the sphere and

the cylinder.

a. Cylinder In the case of the cylinder, the components of the velocity ﬁeld are given

through the deﬁnition of the Lagrangian stream function (Eqn. 8). Symmetry requires that

the net force on the cylinder must be in the same direction as the uniform stream. Because

the uniform stream is in the ˆx direction, if follows from Eqns. 15 and 16 that the force4 on

the cylinder per unit length is given by:

The drag coeﬃcient for an inﬁnite cylinder is deﬁned as CD = FNet/ρ|~u∞|2a. Note that

authors (e.g., (Lagerstrom et al., 1967; Tritton, 1959)) who deﬁne the Reynolds number

based on diameter nonetheless use the same deﬁnition of CD, which is based on the radius.

For this problem, FNet = Fˆx, as given by Eqn. 17. Introducing the dimensionless variables

deﬁned in Table II into Eqn. 17, we obtain Eqn. 18. Combining this with the deﬁnition of

CD, we obtain Eqn. 19.

To evaluate this expression, we must ﬁrst derive p(r, θ) from the stream function.

The pressure can be determined to within an irrelevant additive constant by integrat-
ing the ˆθ component of the Navier-Stokes equations (Eqn. 6) (Chester and Breach, 1969;

Landau and Lifschitz, 1999). The constant is irrelevant because, in Eqn. 19,

Given a solution for the stream function ψ, the set of dimensionless Eqns. 8, 19, and 20

uniquely determine CD for a cylinder. Because the velocity ﬁeld satisﬁes no-slip boundary

conditions, these general formula often simplify considerably.

For instance, consider the class of stream functions which meets the boundary conditions

(Eqn. 10) and can be expressed as a Fourier sine series: ψ(r, θ) =

∞
n=1 fn(r) sin nθ. Using
the boundary conditions it can be shown that, for these stream functions, Eqn. 19 reduces

b. Sphere

The procedure for calculating CD in the case of the sphere is nearly identical to that for

the cylinder. The components of the velocity ﬁeld are given through the deﬁnition of the

Stokes’ stream function (Eqn. 11). As before, symmetry requires that any net force on the

cylinder must be in the direction of the uniform stream, in this case the ˆz direction.

From Eqn. 15, the net force on the sphere is given by Eqn. 22.

For the sphere, the drag coeﬃcient is deﬁned as CD ≡ FNet/ρ|~u∞|2a2. Often the drag
coeﬃcient is given in terms of the Stokes’ Drag, DS ≡ 6πρ|~u∞|aν = 6πρ|~u∞|2a2/R. In these

terms, CD = FNet6π/DSR. If FNet = DS, CD = 6π/R, the famous result of Stokes (Stokes,

1851).

Not all authors follow Stokes’ original deﬁnition of CD. For instance, S. Goldstein

(Goldstein, 1929, 1965) and H. Liebster (Liebster, 1927; Liebster and Schiller, 1924) de-

ﬁne CD using a factor based on cross-sectional areas: C Goldstein

= CD2/π. These authors

D

also deﬁne R using the diameter of the sphere rather than the radius. S. Dennis, deﬁnes CD

similarly to Goldstein, but without the factor of two: C Dennis

= CD/π (Dennis and Walker,

D

1971).

Using the form of Eqn. 16 given in Landau (Landau and Lifschitz, 1999) and introducing

the dimensionless variables deﬁned in Table II into Eqn. 22, we obtain Eqn. 23. Combining

As with the cylinder, the pressure can be determined to within an irrelevant addi-
tive constant by integrating the ˆθ component of the Navier-Stokes equations (Eqn. 6)

Given a solution for the stream function ψ, the set of dimensionless Eqns. 11, 24, and 25

uniquely determine CD for a sphere.

As with the cylinder, the imposition of no-slip boundary conditions considerably simpli-

ﬁes these general formula. In particular, consider stream functions of the form ψ(r, θ) =

∞
n=1 fn(r)Qn(cos θ), where Qn(x) is deﬁned as in Eqn. 46. If these stream functions satisfy

the boundary conditions, the drag is given by Eqn. 26:

c. A subtle point

When applicable, Eqns. 21 and 26 are the most convenient way to calculate the drag

given a stream function. They simply require diﬀerentiation of a single angular term’s

radial coeﬃcient. However, they only apply to functions that can be expressed as a series of

harmonic functions. Moreover, for these simple formula to apply, the series expansions must

meet the boundary conditions exactly. This requirement implies that each of the functions

fi(r) independently meets the boundary conditions.

16

The goal of our work is to derive and understand approximate solutions to the Navier-

Stokes’ equations. These approximate solutions generally will not satisfy the boundary

conditions exactly. What — if any — applicability do Eqns. 21 and 26 have if the stream

function does not exactly meet the boundary conditions?

In some rare cases, the stream function of interest can be expressed in a convenient

closed form. In these cases, it is natural to calculate the drag coeﬃcient using the full set

of equations. However we will see that the solution for these problems is generally only

expressible as a series in harmonic functions. In these cases, it actually preferable to use the

simpliﬁed equations 21 and 26.

First, these equations reﬂect the essential symmetry of the problem, the symmetry im-

posed by the uniform ﬂow. Equations 21 and 26 explicitly demonstrate that, given an exact

solution, only the lowest harmonic will matter: Only terms which have the same angular

dependence as the uniform stream will contribute to the drag. By utilizing the simpliﬁed

formula for CD as opposed to the general procedure, we eﬀectively discard contributions

from higher harmonics. This is exactly what we want, since these contributions are artifacts

of our approximations, and would not be present in an exact solution.

The contributions from inaccuracies in how the lowest harmonic meets the boundary

conditions are more subtle. As long as the boundary conditions are satisﬁed to the accuracy

of the overall approximation, it does not matter whether one uses the full-blown or simpli-

ﬁed drag formula. The drag coeﬃcients will agree to within the accuracy of the original

approximation.

In general, we will use the simpliﬁed formula. This is the approach taken explicitly by

many matched asymptotics workers (Chester and Breach, 1969; Skinner, 1975), and covertly

by other workers (Proudman and Pearson, 1957; Van Dyke, 1975). It should be noted that

these workers only use the portion5 of their solutions which can exactly meet the assump-

tions of the simpliﬁed drag formula. However, as we will subsequently discuss, this is an

oversimpliﬁcation.

5 To be precise, they use only the Stokes’ expansion, rather than a uniform expansion.

II. HISTORY OF LOW R FLOW STUDIES

A. Experiments and numerical calculations

Theoretical attempts to determine the drag by solving the Navier-Stokes’ equations have

been paralleled by an equally intricate set of experiments. In the case of the sphere, ex-

periments usually measured the terminal velocity of small falling spheres in a homogeneous

ﬂuid. In the case of the cylinder, workers measured the force exerted on thin wires or ﬁbers

immersed in a uniformly ﬂowing viscous ﬂuid.

These experiments, while simple in concept, were diﬃcult undertakings. The regime

of interest necessitates some combination of small objects, slow motion, and viscous ﬂuid.

Precise measurements are not easy, and neither is insuring that the experiment actually

examines the same quantities that the theory predicts. All theoretical drag coeﬃcients

concern objects in an inﬁnite ﬂuid, which asymptotically tends to a uniform stream. Any

real drag coeﬃcient measurements must take care to avoid aﬀects due to the ﬁnite size of

the experiment. Due to the wide variety of reported results in the literature, we found it

necessary to make a complete survey, as presented in this section.

1. Measuring the drag on a sphere

As mentioned, experiments measuring the drag on a sphere at low Reynolds number were

intertwined with theoretical developments. Early experiments, which essentially conﬁrmed

Stokes’ law as a reasonable approximation, include those of Allen (Allen, 1900), Arnold

(Arnold H. D., 1911), Williams (Williams, 1915), and Wieselsberger (Wieselsberger, 1922).

The next round of experiments were done in the 1920s, motivated by the theoretical

advances begun by C. W. Oseen (Oseen, 1910). These experimentalists included Schmeidel

(Schmiedel, 1928), Liebster (Liebster, 1927; Liebster and Schiller, 1924). The results of

Allen, Liebster, and Arnold were analyzed, collated, and averaged by Castleman (Castleman,

1925), whose paper is often cited as a summary of prior experiments. The state of aﬀairs

after this work is well summarized in plots given by Goldstein (p. 16) (Goldstein, 1965), and

Perry (Perry, 1950). Figure 3 shows Goldstein’s plot, digitized and re-expressed in terms of

the conventional deﬁnitions of CD and R.

Figure 3 shows the experimental data at this point, prior to the next theoretical devel-

opment, matched asymptotics. Although the experimental data seem to paint a consistent

portrait of the function CD(R), in reality they are not good enough to distinguish between

diﬀerent theoretical predictions.

Finite geometries cause the most signiﬁcant experimental errors for these measure-ments

(Lindgren, 1999; Maxworthy, 1965; Tritton, 1988). Tritton notes that “the container di-

ameter must be more than one hundred times the sphere diameter for the error to be less

than 2 percent”, and Lindgren estimates that a ratio of 50 between the container and sphere

diameters will result in a 4% change in drag force.

In 1961, Fidleris et al.

experimentally studied the eﬀects of ﬁnite container size on

drag coeﬃcient measurements (Fidleris and Whitmore, 1961). They concluded that there

were signiﬁcant ﬁnite size eﬀects in previous experiments, but also proposed corrections

to compensate for earlier experimental limitations. Lindgren also conducted some related

experiments (Lindgren, 1999).

T. Maxworthy also realized this problem, and undertook experiments which could be

used to evaluate the more precise predictions of matched asymptotics theories. In his own

words,

From the data plotted in Goldstein or Perry, it would appear that the presently

available data is suﬃcient to accurately answer any reasonable question. How-

ever, when the data is plotted ‘correctly’; that is, the drag is non-dimensionalized

with respect to the Stokes drag, startling inaccuracies appear. It is in fact im-

possible to be sure of the drag to better than ±20% ... The diﬃculties faced

by previous investigators seemed to be mainly due to an inability to accurately

compensate for wall eﬀects (Maxworthy, 1965).

Maxworthy reﬁned the falling sphere technique to produce the best experimental mea-

surements yet — 2% error. He also proposed a new way of plotting the data, which removes

the R−1 divergence in Eqn. 24 (as R → 0). His approach makes clear the failings of earlier

measurements, as can be seen in Figure 4, where the drag measurements are normalized by

the Stokes drag, C Stokes

= 6π/R.

D

In Maxworthy’s apparatus, the container diameter is over 700 times the sphere diameter,

20

and does not contribute signiﬁcantly to experimental error, which he estimates at better

than 2 percent. Note that the data in Figure 4 are digitized from his paper, as raw data are

not available.

This problem also attracted the attention of atmospheric scientists, who realized its

signiﬁcance in cloud physics, where “cloud drops may well be approximated by rigid spheres

(Pruppacher and Le Clair, 1970).” In a series of papers (e.g., (Beard and Pruppacher, 1969;

Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970; Pruppacher and Le Clair, 1970; Pruppacher and Steinberger,

1968)), H.R. Pruppacher and others undertook numerical and experimental studies of the

drag on the sphere. They were motivated by many of the same reasons as Maxworthy,

because his experiments covered only Reynolds numbers between 0.4 and 11, and because

“Maxworthy’s experimental setup and procedure left considerable room for improvement”

(Pruppacher and Steinberger, 1968).

Their results included over 220 measurements, which they binned and averaged. They

presented their results in the form of a set of linear ﬁts. Adopting Maxworthy’s normaliza-

tion, we collate and summarize their ﬁndings in Eqn. 27.

Unfortunately, one of their later papers includes the following footnote (in our notation):

“At R < 1 the most recent values of CDR/6π − 1 (Pruppacher, 1969, unpublished) tended

to be somewhat higher than those of Pruppacher and Steinberger.” (Le Clair and Hamielec,

1970) Their subsequent papers plot these unpublished data as “experimental scatter.” As

the unpublished data are in much better agreement with both Maxworthy’s measurements

and their own numerical analysis (Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970), it makes us question the

validity of the results given in Eqn. 27.

Most of these results are not useful either because of large errors (e.g., Jenson), or because

they study ranges of Reynolds number which do not include R < 1. Many numerical studies

examine only a few (or even just a single) Reynolds numbers. For the purposes of comparing

theoretical predictions of CD at low Reynolds number, only Dennis (Dennis and Walker,

1971) and Le Clair (Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970) have useful calculations. Both of these

papers report tabulated results which are in very good agreement with both each other and

Maxworthy; at R = 0.5, the three sets of results agree to within 1% in CD, and to within

10% in the transformed variable, CDR/6π − 1. The agreement is even better for R < 0.5.

Figure 5 shows all relevant experimental and numerical results for the drag on a

sphere. Note the clear disagreement between Pruppacher’s results (Eqn.

27), and all

of the other results for R < 1 — including Le Clair and Pruppacher’s numerical results

(Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970). This can be clearly seen in the inset graph. Although

Pruppacher’s experiment results do agree very well with other data for larger values of R

(R & 20), we will disregard them for the purposes of evaluating theoretical predictions at

low Reynolds number.

It should also be noted that there is a community of researchers interested in sedimenta-

tion and settling velocities who have studied the drag on a sphere. In a contribution to this

literature, Brown reviews all of the authors discussed here, in an eﬀort to tabulate CD for

R < 5000 (Brown and Lawler, 2003). His report addresses a larger range of Reynolds num-

bers and he summarizes a number of experiments not treated here. His methodology is to

apply the Fidleris’ correction (Fidleris and Whitmore, 1961) to previous experiments where

tabulated experimental data was published.6 While this yields a reasonably well-behaved

drag coeﬃcient for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, it is not particularly useful for our

purposes, as less accurate work obfuscates the results of the most precise experiments near

R = 0. It also does not include numerical work or important results which are only available

graphically (e.g., Maxworthy (Maxworthy, 1965)).

2. Measuring the drag on a cylinder

Experiments designed to measure the drag on an inﬁnite cylinder in a uniform ﬂuid came

later than those for spheres. In addition to being a more diﬃcult experiment — theoretical

calculations assume the cylinder is inﬁnite — there were no theoretical predictions to test

before Lamb’s result in 1911 (Lamb H., 1911).

In 1914, E. F. Relf conducted the ﬁrst experiments (Relf, 1914). These looked at the

force exerted on long wires in a ﬂuid. Relf measured the drag down to a Reynolds number

of about ten.

In 1921, Wieselberger measured the drag at still lower Reynods number,

reaching R = 2.11 by looking at the deﬂection of a weight suspended on a wire in an air

stream (Wieselsberger, 1921).

These experiments, combined with others (Goldstein, 1965; Linke, 1931) at higher

Reynolds number, characterize the drag over a range of Reynolds numbers (see Goldstein,

pg. 15). However, they do not probe truly small Reynolds numbers (R ≪ 1), and are of

little use for evaluating theories which are only valid in that range. Curiously, there are

no shortage of claims otherwise, such as Lamb, who says “The formula is stated to be in

good agreement with experiment for suﬃciently small values of U∞a/ν; see Wieselsberger”

(Lamb, 1932).

In 1933, Thom measured the “pressure drag”, extending observations down to R = 1.75.

6 Brown erroneously reports Dennis’ work (Dennis and Walker, 1971) as experimental.

FIG. 6 (Color online) Tritton’s measurements of the drag on a cylinder (Tritton, 1959).

Thom also notes that this Reynolds number is still too high to compare with calculations:

“Actually, Lamb’s solution only applies to values of R less than those shown, in fact to values

much less than unity, but evidently in most cases the experimental results are converging

with them.” (Thom, 1933)

In 1946, White undertook a series of measurements, which were ﬂawed due to wall eﬀects

(White, 1946). The ﬁrst high quality experiments which measured the drag at low Reynolds

number were done by R. K. Finn (Finn, 1953). His results, available only in graphical form,

are reproduced Figure 7. While vastly superior to any previous results, there is considerable

scatter in Finn’s measurements, and they have largely been surpassed by later experiments.

Tritton, in 1959, conducted experiments which reached a Reynolds number of R = 0.2,

and also ﬁlled in some gaps in the R − CD curve (Tritton, 1959). Tritton estimates his

accuracy at ±6%, and compares his results favorably to previous work, commenting that,

“Probably the lowest R points of the other workers were stretching their techniques a little

beyond their limits.” Tritton is also the ﬁrst author to give a discussion of systematic errors.7

Tritton’s results are shown in Figure 6. All of his data are available in tabular form.

Maxworthy improved plots of the drag on a sphere (Fig. 3), by arguing that the leading

divergence must be removed to better compare experiments and predictions (Fig. 4). This

same criticism applies to plots of the drag on a cylinder. In the case of the cylinder, CD goes

as R−1 (with logarithmic corrections) as R → 0 (Eqn. 19). This means we ought to plot

CDR/4π. This function tends to zero as R → 0, so it is not necessary to plot CDR/4π − 1,

as in the case of the sphere. Figure 7 shows both Finn’s and Tritton’s data re-plotted with

the leading divergence removed.

In 1965, K. O. L. F. Jayaweera (Jayaweera and Mason, 1965) undertook drag mea-

surements of the drag on very long (but ﬁnite) cylinders. At very low Reynolds number

(R ≤ 0.135), his data are available in tabular form. At higher Reynolds number, they had

to be digitized. His data, plotted with the leading divergence removed, are also shown in

7 Tritton does caution that his measurements may be negatively biased at higher Reynolds number (R & 30).

25

Figure 7.

The agreement amongst these experiments is excellent. Henceforth, Finn’s data will not

be plotted, as it exhibits larger experimental variations, and is surpassed by the experiments

of Jayaweera and Tritton. Jayaweera’s data exhibit the least scatter, and may be slightly

better than Tritton’s. However, both experiments have comparable, large ratios of cylinder

length to width (the principle source of experimental error), and there is no a priori reason

to favor one experimental design over the other. We consider these two experiments to be

equivalent for the purposes of evaluating theoretical predictions.

As with the sphere, there are numerical calculations, including: Underwood (Underwood,

1969), Son (Son and Hanratty, 1969), Kawaguti (Kawaguti and Jain, 1966), Dennis

(Dennis and Shmshoni, 1965), Thom (Thom, 1933), Apelt (Apelt, 1961), and Allen

(Allen and Southwell, 1955). Of these, most treat only a few Reynolds numbers, none

of which are suﬃciently small. Others, such as Allen and Dennis, have had their results

subsequently questioned (Underwood, 1969). The only applicable studies are Kawaguti

(Kawaguti and Jain, 1966), and Underwood (Underwood, 1969). Kawaguti has a calcula-

tion only for R = 0.5, and is omitted. Underwood’s results are in principle important and

useful, but are only available in a coarse plot, which cannot be digitized with suﬃcient accu-

racy. Consequently, no numerical results will be used for evaluating analytical predictions.

There are many diﬀerent experimental and numerical drag coeﬃcient measurements. We

will subsequently use only the most best as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of

theoretical predictions. In the case of the sphere, the experimental measurements of Maxwor-

thy (Maxworthy, 1965) as well as the numerical calculations of Dennis (Dennis and Walker,

1971) and Le Clair (Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970) all extend to suﬃciently small R and

possess suﬃcient accuracy. For the cylinder the experiments of both Tritton (Tritton, 1959)

and Jayaweera (Jayaweera and Mason, 1965) are both excellent. Although they exhibit

small diﬀerences, we cannot judge either to be superior, and we will compare both with

theoretical results.

B. Theoretical history

Since these problems were posed by Stokes in 1851, there have been many attempts to

solve them. All of these methods involve approximations, which are not always rigorous (or

26

even explicitly stated). There is also considerable historical confusion over contributions and

attribution.8 Here we review and summarize the substantial contributions to the literature,

focusing on what approximations are used, in both deriving governing equations and in their

subsequent solution. We discuss the validity and utility of important results. Finally, we

emphasize methodological shortcomings and how they have been surmounted.

1. Stokes and paradoxes

In the ﬁrst paper on the subject, Stokes approximated R = 0 in Eqn. 6 and solved the

resulting equation (a problem equivalent to solving Eqn. 12 with R = 0) (Stokes, 1851).

After applying the boundary conditions (Eqn. 14), his solution is given in terms of a stream

function by Eqn. 28.

By substituting ψ(r, µ) into Eqns. 11, 24, and 25 (or by using Eqn. 26), we reproduce the

famous result of Stokes, given by Eqn. 29.

R

Stokes also tackled the two dimensional cylinder problem in a similar fashion, but could

not obtain a solution. The reason for his failure can be by setting R = 0 in Eqn. 9, and

attempting a direct solution. Enforcing the sin θ angular dependence results in a solution of

the form ψ(r, θ) = (C1r3 + C2r ln r + C3r + C4/r) sin θ. Here Ci are integration constants.

No choice of Ci will meet the boundary conditions Eqn. (10), as this solution cannot match

the uniform ﬂow at large r. The best one can do is to set C1 = 0, resulting in a partial

solution:

ψ(r, θ) = C

(cid:19)

Nonetheless, this solution is not a description of ﬂuid ﬂow which is valid everywhere. More-

over, due to the indeterminable constant C, Eqn. 30 cannot be used to estimate the drag

on the cylinder.

8 For an explanation of confusion over early work, see Lindgren (Lindgren, 1999). Proudman and Pearson
(Proudman and Pearson, 1957) also begin their article with an insightful, nuanced discussion, although
there are some errors (Lindgren, 1999).

TABLE III Dimensional analysis of Stokes’ problem.

A more elegant way to see that no solution may exist is through dimensional analysis

(Happel and Brenner, 1973; Landau and Lifschitz, 1999). The force per unit length may

only depend on the cylinder radius, ﬂuid viscosity, ﬂuid density, and uniform stream velocity.

These quantities are given in Table III, with M denoting a unit of mass, T a unit of time,

and L a unit of length. From these quantities, one may form two dimensionless groups

(Buckingham, 1914): Π0 = R = |~u∞|a/ν, Π1 = FNet/(ρν|~u∞|). Buckingham’s Π Theorem

(Buckingham, 1914) then tells us that:

If we make the assumption that the problem does not depend on R, as Stokes did, then we

obtain Π1 = const, whence

Π0 = F (R)

FNet ∝ ρν|~u∞|

(31)

(32)

However, Eqn. 32 does not depend on the cylinder radius, a! This is physically absurd,

and demonstrates that Stokes’ assumptions cannot yield a solution. The explanation is

that when we take the R → 0 limit in Eqn. 31, we made the incorrect assumption that

F (R) tended toward a ﬁnite, non-zero limit. This is an example of incomplete similarity, or

similarity of the second kind (in the Reynolds number) (Barenblatt, 1996). Note that the

problem of ﬂow past a sphere involves force, not force per unit length, and therefore is not

subject to the same analysis.

Stokes incorrectly took this nonexistence of a solution to mean that steady-state ﬂow past

an inﬁnite cylinder could not exist. This problem, which is known as Stokes’ paradox, has

been shown to occur with any unbounded two-dimensional ﬂow (Krakowski and Charnes,

1953). But it is a mathematical problem, not a physical one, and it has since been resolved.

28

In 1888, Whitehead, attempted to ﬁnd higher approximations for ﬂow past a sphere, ones

which would be valid for small but non-negligible Reynolds numbers (Whitehead, 1888). He

used Stokes’ solution (Eqn. 28) to approximate viscous contributions (the LHS of Eqn. 12),

aiming to iteratively obtain higher approximations for the inertial terms. In principle, this

approach can be repeated indeﬁnitely, always using a linear governing equation to obtain

higher order approximations. Unfortunately, Whitehead found that his next order solution

could not meet all of the boundary conditions (Eqn. 14), because he could not match the

uniform stream at inﬁnity (Van Dyke, 1975). These diﬃculties are analogous to the problems

encountered in Stokes’ analysis of the inﬁnite cylinder.

Whitehead’s approach is equivalent to a perturbative expansion in the Reynolds

number, an approach which is “never valid in problems of uniform streaming”

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957). This mathematical diﬃculty is common to all three-

dimensional uniform ﬂow problems, and is known as Whitehead’s paradox. Whitehead

thought this was due to discontinuities in the ﬂow ﬁeld (a “dead-water wake”), but this

is incorrect, and his “paradox” has also since been resolved (Van Dyke, 1975).

2. Oseen’s equation

a. Introduction

In 1893, Rayleigh pointed out that Stokes’ solution would be uniformly applicable if

certain inertial forces were included, and noted that the ratio of those inertial forces to the

viscous forces which Stokes considered could be used to estimate the accuracy of Stokes’

approximations (Lord Rayleigh, 1893).

Building on these ideas in 1910, C. W. Oseen proposed an ad hoc approximation to the

Navier-Stokes equations which resolved both paradoxes. His linearized equations (the Oseen

equations) attempted to deal with the fact that the equations governing Stokes’ perturbative

expansion are invalid at large |~r|, where they neglect important inertial terms. In addition

to Oseen, a number of workers, have applied his equations to a wide variety of problems,

including both the cylinder and the sphere.9

9 Lamb (Lamb, 1932) solved the Oseen equations for the cylinder approximately, as Oseen (Oseen, 1910)
did for the sphere. The cylinder equations have been solved exactly by Fax´en (Fax´en, 1927), as well as by
Tomotika and Aoi (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950), and the sphere was solved exactly by Goldstein (Goldstein,

29

Oseen’s governing equation arises independently in several diﬀerent contexts. Oseen

derived the equation in an attempt to obtain an approximate equation which describes the

ﬂow everywhere. In modern terminology, he sought a governing equation whose solution is

a uniformly valid approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Whether he succeeded is

a matter of some debate. The short answer is “Yes, but he got lucky.”

This story is further complicated by historical confusion. Oseen’s equations “are valid but

for the wrong reason” (Lindgren, 1999); Oseen originally objected to working in the inertial

frame where the solid body is at rest, and therefore undertook calculations in the rest frame of

uniform stream. This complication is overlooked largely because many subsequent workers

have only understood Oseen’s intricate three paper analysis through the lens of Lamb’s

later work (Lamb H., 1911). Lamb — in addition to writing in English — presents a clearer,

“shorter way of arriving at his [Oseen’s] results”, which he characterizes as “somewhat long

and intricate.” (Lamb H., 1911)

In 1913 Fritz Noether, using both Rayleigh’s and Oseen’s ideas, analyzed the problem

using stream functions (Noether, 1913). Noether’s paper prompted criticisms from Oseen,

who then revisited his own work. A few months later, Oseen published another paper, which

included a new result for CD (Eqn. 39) (Oseen, 1913). Burgess also explains the development

of Oseen’s equation, and presents a clear derivation of Oseen’s principal results, particularly

of Oseen’s new formula for CD (Burgess R.W., 1916).

Lindgren oﬀers a detailed discussion of these historical developments (Lindgren, 1999).

However, he incorrectly reports Noether’s publication date as 1911, rather than 1913. As

a result, he incorrectly concludes that Noether’s work was independent of Oseen’s, and

contradicts claims made in Burgess (Burgess R.W., 1916).

Although the theoretical justiﬁcation for Oseen’s approximations is tenuous, its success at

resolving the paradoxes of both Stokes and Whitehead led to widespread use. Oseen’s equa-

tion has been fruitfully substituted for the Navier-Stokes’ equations in a broad array of low

Reynolds number problems. Happel and Brenner describe its application to many problems

in the dynamics of small particles where interactions can be neglected (Happel and Brenner,

1973). Many workers have tried to explain the utility and unexpected accuracy of Oseen’s

governing equations.

1929).

30

Finally, the Oseen equation, as a partial diﬀerential equation, arises in both matched

asymptotic calculations and in our new work.

In these cases, however, its genesis and

interpretation is entirely diﬀerent, and the similarity is purely formal. Due to its ubiquity

and historical signiﬁcance, we now discuss both Oseen’s equation and its many diﬀerent

solutions in detail.

b. Why Stokes’ approximation breaks down

Oseen solved the paradoxes of Stokes and Whitehead by using Rayleigh’s insight: compare

the magnitude of inertial and viscous forces (Lord Rayleigh, 1893; Oseen, 1910). Stokes and

Whitehead had completely neglected inertial terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, working

in the regime where the Reynolds number is insigniﬁcantly small (so-called “creeping ﬂow”).

However, this assumption can only be valid near the surface of the ﬁxed body. It is never

valid everywhere.

To explain why, we follow here the spirit of Lamb’s analysis, presenting Oseen’s conclu-

sions “under a slightly diﬀerent form.” (Lamb H., 1911)

Consider ﬁrst the case of the sphere. We can estimate the magnitude of the neglected

inertial terms by using Stokes’ solution (Eqn. 28). Substituting this result into the RHS of

Eqn. 12, we see that the dominant inertial components are convective accelerations arising

from the nonlinear terms in Eqn. 12. These terms reﬂect interactions between the uniform

stream and the perturbations described by Eqn. 28. For large values of |~r|, these terms are

of O (Rr−2).

Estimating the magnitude of the relevant viscous forces is somewhat trickier.

If we

substitute Eqn. 28 into the LHS of Eqn. 12, the LHS vanishes identically. To learn anything,

we must consider the terms individually. There are two kinds of terms which arise far from

the sphere. Firstly, there are components due solely to the uniform stream. These are

of O (r−2). However, the uniform stream satisﬁes Eqn. 12 independently, without the

new contributions in Stokes’ solution. Mathematically, this means that all of the terms of

O (r−2) necessarily cancel amongst themselves.10 We are interested in the magnitude of the

remaining terms, perturbations which result from the other components of Stokes’ solution.

These viscous terms (i.e. the ∂4

θ term in Eqn. 12) are of O (r−3) as r → ∞.

10 VanDyke (Van Dyke, 1975) is misleadingly cavalier in his treatment of this issue, and we recommend
Proudman (Proudman and Pearson, 1957) or Happel (Happel and Brenner, 1973) for a more careful dis-
cussion.

31

Combining these two results, the ratio of inertial to viscous terms, in the r → ∞ limit,

is given by Eqn. 33.

inertial
viscous

= O (Rr)

(33)

This ratio is small near the body (r is small) and justiﬁes neglecting inertial terms in

that regime. However, Stokes’ implicit assumption that inertial terms are everywhere small

compared to viscous terms breaks down when Rr ∼ O (1), and the two kinds of forces are

of the same magnitude. In this regime, Stokes’ solution is not valid, and therefore cannot be

used to estimate the inertial terms (as Whitehead had done). Technically speaking, Stokes’

approximations breaks down because of a singularity at inﬁnity, an indication that this is a

singular perturbation in the Reynolds’ number. As Oseen pointed out, this is the genesis of

Whitehead’s “paradox”.

What does this analysis tell us about the utility of Stokes’ solution? Diﬀerent opinions

can be found in the literature. Happel, for instance, claims that it “is not uniformly valid”

(Happel and Brenner, 1973), while Proudman asserts “Stokes’ solution is therefore actually

a uniform approximation to the total velocity distribution.” (Proudman and Pearson, 1957)

By a uniform approximation, we mean that the approximation asymptotically approaches

the exact solution as the Reynolds’ number goes to zero (Kaplun and Lagerstrom, 1957);

see Section II.C for further discussion.

Proudman and Pearson clarify their comment by noting that although Stokes’ solution is a

uniform approximation to total velocity distribution, it does not adequately characterize the

perturbation to the uniform stream, or the derivatives of the velocity. This is a salient point,

for the calculations leading to Eqn. 33 examine components of the Navier-Stokes equations,

not the velocity ﬁeld itself. These components are forces — derivatives of velocity.

However, Proudman and Pearson oﬀer no proof that Stokes’ solution is actually a uniform

approximation, and their claim that it is “a valid approximation to many bulk properties of

the ﬂow, such as the resistance” (Proudman and Pearson, 1957) goes unsupported. In fact

any calculation of the drag necessitates utilizing derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld, so their

analysis is inconsistent.

We are forced to conclude that Stokes’ solution is not a uniformly valid approximation,

and that his celebrated result, Eqn. 29, is the fortuitous result of uncontrolled approxima-

tions. Remarkably, Stokes’ drag formula is in fact a correct zeroth order approximation, as

can be shown using either matched asymptotics or the Oseen equation! This coincidence is

32

essentially due to the fact that the drag is determined by the velocity ﬁeld and its deriva-

tives at the surface of the sphere, where r = 1, and Eqn. 33 is O (R1). The drag coeﬃcient

calculation uses Stokes’ solution in the regime where his assumptions are the most valid.

A similar analysis aﬀords insight into the origin of Stokes’ paradox in the problem of

the cylinder. Although we have seen previously that Stokes’ approach must fail for both

algebraic and dimensional considerations, examining the ratio between inertial and viscous

forces highlights the physical inconsistencies in Stokes’ assumptions.

We can use the incomplete solution given by Eqn. 30 to estimate the relative contributions

of inertial and viscous forces in Eqn. 9. More speciﬁcally, we examine the behavior of these

forces at large values of r. Substituting Eqn. 30 into the RHS of Eqn. 9, we ﬁnd that the

inertial forces are O (RC 2 log r/r2) as r → ∞.

We estimate the viscous forces as in the case of the sphere, again ignoring contributions

due solely to the uniform stream. The result is that the viscous forces are O (C log r/r3).11

Combining the two estimates, we obtain the result given in Eqn. 34.

inertial
viscous

= O (Rr)

(34)

This result demonstrates that the paradoxes of Stokes’ and Whitehead are the result of

the same failures in Stokes’ uncontrolled approximation. Far from the solid body, there is a

regime where it is incorrect to assume that the inertial terms are negligible in comparison

to viscous terms. Although these approximations happened to lead to a solution in the case

of the sphere, Stokes’ approach is invalid and technically inconsistent in both problems.

c. How Oseen Resolved the Paradoxes

Not only did Oseen identify the physical origin for the breakdowns in previous approxi-

mations, but he also discovered a solution (Oseen, 1910). As explained above, the problems

arise far from the solid body, when inertial terms are no longer negligible. However, in this

region (r ≫ 1), the ﬂow ﬁeld is nearly a uniform stream — it is almost unperturbed by the

solid body. Oseen’s inspiration was to replace the inertial terms with linearized approxi-

mations far from the body. Mathematically, the ﬂuid velocity ~u in Eqn. 6 is replaced by

the quantity ~u∞ + ~u, where ~u represents the perturbation to the uniform stream, and is

11 This result disagrees with the results of Proudman (Proudman and Pearson, 1957) and VanDyke

(Van Dyke, 1975).

33

considered to be small. Neglecting terms of O (|~u|2), the viscous forces of the Navier-Stokes’

equation — R (~u · ∇~u) — are approximated by R (~u∞ · ∇~u).

This results in Oseen’s equation:

R (~u∞ · ∇~u) = −∇p + ∇2~u

(35)

The lefthand side of this equation is negligible in the region where Stokes’ solution applies.

One way to see this is by explicitly substituting Eqn. 28 or Eqn. 30 into the LHS of Eqn.

35. The result is of O (R). This can also be done self-consistently with any of the solutions

of Eqn. 35; it can thereby be explicitly shown that the LHS can only becomes important

when r ≫ 1, and the ratios in Eqns. 33 and 34 are of O (1).

Coupled with the continuity equation (Eqn. 5), and the usual boundary conditions, the

Oseen equation determines the ﬂow ﬁeld everywhere. The beautiful thing about Oseen’s

equation is that it is linear, and consequently is solvable in a wide range of geometries. In

terms of stream functions, the Oseen equation for a sphere takes on the form given by Eqn.

36. The boundary conditions for this equation are still given by Eqn. 14.

A few historical remarks must be made. First, Oseen and Noether were motivated to

reﬁne Stokes’ work and include inertial terms because they objected to the analysis being

done in the rest frame of the solid body. While their conclusions are valid, there is nothing

wrong with solving the problem in any inertial frame. Secondly, Oseen made no use of

stream functions; the above equations summarize results from several workers, particularly

Lamb.

There are many solutions to Oseen’s equations, applying to diﬀerent geometries and

conﬁgurations, including some exact solutions. For any useful calculations, such as CD,

34

even the exact solutions need to be compromised with approximations. There have been

many years of discussion about how to properly interpret Oseen’s approximations, and

how to understand the limitations of both his approach and concomitant solutions. Before

embarking on this analysis, we summarize the important solutions to Eqns. 36 and 37.

d. A plethora of solutions

Oseen himself provided the ﬁrst solution to Eqn. 36, solving it exactly for ﬂow past a

sphere (Oseen, 1910). Eqn. 38 reproduces this result in terms of stream functions, a formula

ﬁrst given by Lamb (Lamb, 1932).

Oseen obtained this prediction for CD after the prompting of Noether, and only presented

it in a later paper (Oseen, 1913). Burgess also obtained this result (Burgess R.W., 1916).

Oseen’s work was hailed as a resolution to Whitehead’s paradox. While it did resolve the

paradoxes (e.g., he explained how to deal with inertial terms), and his solution is uniformly

valid, it does not posses suﬃcient accuracy to justify the “3/8R” term in Eqn. 39. What

Oseen really did was to rigorously derive the leading order term, proving the validity of

Stokes’ result (Eqn. 29). Remarkably, his new term is also correct! This is a coincidence

which will be carefully considered later.

This solution (Eqn. 38) is exact in the sense that it satisﬁes Eqn. 36. However, it does

not exactly meet the boundary conditions (Eqn. 14) at the surface of the sphere. It satisﬁes

those requirements only approximately, to O (R1). This can readily be seen by expanding

Eqn. 38 about r = 1:

Up to O (R) this is simply Stokes’ solution (Eqn. 28), which vanishes identically at r = 1.

(cid:1)

The new terms fail to satisfy the boundary conditions at the surface, but are higher order in

R. Thus Oseen’s solution is an exact solution to an approximate governing equation which

satisﬁes boundary conditions approximately. The implications of this confounding hierarchy

of approximations will be discussed below.

35

Lamb contributed a simpliﬁed method for both deriving and solving Oseen’s equation

(Lamb H., 1911). His formulation was fruitfully used by later workers (e.g., (Fax´en, 1927;

Goldstein, 1929; Tomotika and Aoi, 1950)), and Lamb himself used it both to reproduce

Oseen’s results and to obtain the ﬁrst result for the drag on an inﬁnite cylinder.

Lamb’s basic solution for ﬂow around an inﬁnite cylinder appears in a number of guises.

His original solution was given in terms of velocity components, and relied on expansions

of modiﬁed Bessel functions which kept only the most important terms in the series. This

truncation results in a solution (Eqn. 41) which only approximately satisﬁes the governing

equations (Eqn. 37), and is only valid near the surface.

Note that, although it only approximately satisﬁes Oseen’s governing equation, that this

result satisﬁes the boundary conditions (Eqn. 4) exactly. Lamb used his solution to derive

the ﬁrst result (Eqn. 42) for the drag on an inﬁnite cylinder, ending Stokes’ paradox. In his

own words, “ ... Stokes was led to the conclusion that steady motion is impossible. It will

appear that when the inertia terms are partially taken into account ... that a deﬁnite value

for the resistance is obtained.” (Lamb H., 1911)

As with all analysis based on the ad-hoc Oseen equation, it is diﬃcult to quantify either the

accuracy or the limitations of Lamb’s result.

Many authors formulate alternate expressions of Lamb’s solution by retaining the mod-

iﬁed Bessel functions rather than replacing them with expansions valid for small R and r.

This form is given by Eqn. 43, and is related to the incomplete form given by VanDyke (p.

In contrast to Eqn. 41, this solution is an exact solution to Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 37),

but only meets the boundary conditions to ﬁrst approximation.

In particular, it breaks

down for harmonics other than sin θ. Whether Eqn. 41 or Eqn. 43 is preferred is a matter

of some debate, and ultimately depends on the problem one is trying to solve.

Some workers prefer expressions like Eqn. 43, which are written in terms of ~u. Unlike the

solutions for the stream function, these results can be written in closed form. This motivation

is somewhat misguided, as applying the boundary conditions nonetheless requires a series

In terms of stream functions Eqn. 43 transforms into Eqn. 44 (Proudman and Pearson,

This result is most easily derived as a special case of Tomotika’s general solution (Eqn.

49) (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950), although Proudman et al. intimate that it can also be directly

derived from Lamb’s solution (Eqn. 43) (Proudman and Pearson, 1957).

Bairstow et al. were the ﬁrst to retain Bessel functions while solving Oseen’s Eqn. for

ﬂow past a cylinder (Bairstow and Cave B.M., 1923). They followed Lamb’s approach, but

endeavored to extend it to larger Reynolds’ numbers, and obtained the drag coeﬃcient given

in Eqn. 45. When expanded near R = 0, this solution reproduces Lamb’s result for CD

(Eqn. 42). It can also be obtained from Tomotika’s more general solution (Eqn. 49).

CD =

12 Note that VanDyke improperly attributes to this result to Oseen, rather than to Lamb.

37

Bairstow also made extensive comparisons between experimental measurements of CD and

theoretical predictions (Relf, 1914). He concluded, “For the moment it would appear that

the maximum use has been made of Oseen’s approximation to the equations of viscous ﬂuid

motion.”

At this point, the “paradoxes” were “resolved” but by an approximate governing equation

which had been solved approximately. This unsatisfactory state of aﬀairs was summarized

by Lamb in the last edition of his book: “ ... even if we accept the equations as adequate the

boundary-conditions have only been approximately satisﬁed.” (Lamb, 1932) His comment

was prompted largely by the work of Hilding Fax´en, who initiated the next theoretical

development, exact solutions to Oseen’s approximate governing equation (Eqn. 35) which

also exactly satisfy the boundary conditions.

Beginning with his thesis and spanning a number of papers Fax´en systematically investi-

gated the application of boundary conditions to solutions of Oseen’s equations (Fax´en, 1921,

1923). Fax´en initially studied low Reynolds number ﬂow around a sphere, and he began

by re-examining Oseen’s analysis. He derived a formula for CD which diﬀered from Oseen’s

accepted result (Eqn. 39). Fax´en realized that this was due to diﬀerences in the application

of approximate boundary conditions; within the limitations of their respective analyses, the

results actually agreed.

Fax´en next solved Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 36), but in bounded, ﬁnite spaces where the

boundary conditions could be satisﬁed exactly. He initially studied ﬂow near inﬁnite parallel

planes, but ultimately focused on ﬂow around a sphere within a cylinder of ﬁnite radius.

He aimed to calculate the drag force in a ﬁnite geometry, and then take the limit of that

solution as the radius of the cylinder tends to inﬁnity.

Unfortunately, in the low Reynolds number limit, the problem involves incomplete simi-

larity, and it is incorrect to assume that solutions will be well behaved (e.g., tend to a ﬁnite

value) as the boundary conditions are moved to inﬁnity.

The drag force which Fax´en calculated involved a number of undetermined coeﬃcients, so

he also calculated it using solutions to Stokes’s governing equations. This solution also has

unknown coeﬃcients, which he then calculated numerically. Arguing that the two solutions

ought to be the same, he matched coeﬃcients between the two results, substituted the

numerical coeﬃcients, and thereby arrived at a drag force based on the Oseen governing

equation.

38

This work is noteworthy for two reasons. First, the matching of coeﬃcients between

solutions derived from the two diﬀerent governing equations is prescient, foreshadowing the

development of matched asymptotics 30 years later. Secondly, Fax´en ultimately concluded

that Oseen’s “improvement” (Eqn. 39) on Stokes’ drag coeﬃcient (Eqn. 29) is invalid

(Fax´en, 1923). Fax´en’s analysis demonstrates that — when properly solved — Oseen’s

equation yields the same drag coeﬃcient as Stokes’, without any additional terms (Lindgren,

1999).

Studies done by Bohlin and Haberman agreed with Fax´en’s conclusions (Bohlin, 1960;

Haberman and Saure, 1958; Lindgren, 1999).

It is not surprising that his results reject

Oseen’s new term (3/8R). We previously explained that Oseen’s analysis, although it elim-

inates the “paradoxes”, does not posses suﬃcient accuracy to justify more than the lowest

order term in Eqn. 39.

However, Fax´en’s results suﬀer from problems. First, they cannot be systematically used

to obtain better approximations. Secondly, Fax´en actually solves the problem for bounded

ﬂow, with the boundary conditions prescribed by ﬁnite geometries. He uses a limiting

procedure to extend his solutions to unbounded ﬂow (with boundary conditions imposed

on the uniform stream only at inﬁnity, as in Eqn. 4). In problems like this, which involve

incomplete similarity, it is preferable to work directly in the inﬁnite domain.

Fax´en’s meticulous devotion to properly applying boundary conditions culminated in the

ﬁrst complete solution to Eqn. 37. In 1927, he published a general solution for ﬂow around an

inﬁnite cylinder which could exactly satisfy arbitrary boundary conditions (Fax´en, 1927).

Unfortunately, Fax´en’s solution contains an inﬁnite number of undetermined integration

constants, and approximations must be used to determine these constants. Although this

unfortunately destroys the “exact” nature of the solution, these approximations can be made

in a controlled, systematic fashion — an improvement over the earlier results of Lamb and

Oseen. Although Fax´en’s solution was the ﬁrst of its kind, his real insight was realizing

that approximations in the application of boundary conditions could be as important as the

approximations in the governing equations.

His formal solutions are in essence a diﬃcult extension of Lamb’s reformulation of Os-

een’s equations, and they inspired several similar solutions. In 1929, Goldstein completed

a herculean calculation to derive a general solution to Oseen’s equation for ﬂow around a

sphere (Goldstein, 1929). Like Fax´en’s result for the cylinder, Goldstein’s solution can — in

39

principle — exactly satisfy the boundary conditions. Unfortunately, it also suﬀers from the

same problems: It is impossible to determine all of the inﬁnitely many integration constants.

Goldstein’s solution is summarized by Tomotika, who also translated it into the language

of stream functions (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950). We combine elements from both papers in

quoting the solution given in Eqn. 46.

Here Kn(x) and In(x) are Bessel functions, Pm(x) are Legendre polynomials, and Cm(k) is
the coeﬃcient of xk in Pm(x). Note that the second expression for fm,n(x), written in terms

of derivatives, is computationally convenient (Goldstein, 1929).

Eqn. 46 is given with undetermined constants of integration, Bn and Xm. Methods to

determine these constants were discussed by both Tomotika (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950) and

Goldstein (Goldstein, 1929). We will present our own analysis later.

There are many diﬀerent results which have been obtained using the above general so-

lution. The exact formula for the stream function and the drag coeﬃcient depend on what

terms in the solution are retained, and how one meets the boundary conditions. In general,

retaining n angular terms in Eqn. 46 requires the retention of m = n − 1 terms in the

40

second sum. In his original paper, Goldstein retains three terms in each series, and thereby

calculates the formula for CD given in Eqn. 48.

To obtain the result in Eqn. 48, Goldstein both truncated his solution for the stream

function and then expanded the resulting CD about R = 0. Van Dyke, extended this result

to include an additional 24 terms, for purposes of studying the mathematical structure of

the series, but not because of any intrinsic physical meaning (Van Dyke, 1970). Van Dyke

does not make it clear whether he was including more harmonics in the stream function

solution or simply increasing the length of the power series given in Eqn. 48.

In addition to expressing Goldstein’s solution for the geometry of a sphere in terms of

stream functions, Tomotika derived his own exact solution to Eqn. 37 for ﬂow past a cylinder

(Tomotika and Aoi, 1950). Tomotika closely followed the spirit of Lamb (Lamb H., 1911)

and Goldstein (Goldstein, 1929), and his resulting “analysis is quite diﬀerent from Fax´en’s.”

(Tomotika and Aoi, 1950). His solution to Eqn. 37 is given in Eqn. 49 below, conveniently

expressed in terms of stream functions. Note that Tomotika’s result suﬀers from the same

problems as his predecessors: An inﬁnite number of undetermined integration constants.

(50)

As before, Bn and Xm are constants of integration which need to be determined by the

boundary conditions (Eqn. 10).

As with Goldstein’s solution for the sphere, approximations are necessary in order to

actually calculate a drag coeﬃcient. By retaining the m = 0 and n = 1 terms, Tomotika

reproduced Bairstow’s result for CD (Eqn. 45). He also numerically calculated drag coeﬃ-

cients based on retaining more terms. As with the Goldstein solution, the keeping n angular

terms requires keeping m = n − 1 terms in the second sum.

41

The solutions given in Eqns. 46 and 49 represent the culmination of eﬀorts to solve

Oseen’s equation for both the sphere and the cylinder. These general solutions are also

needed in both matched asymptotics and the new techniques presented in this section

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957).

There is a ﬁnal noteworthy solution to Eqn. 37. In 1954, Imai published a general method

method for solving the problem of ﬂow past an arbitrary cylindrical body (Imai Isao, 1954).

His elegant technique, based on analytic functions, applies to more general geometries. Imai

calculated a formula for CD, approximating the functions in his exact solution with power

series about R = 0. His result (re-expressed in our notation) is given in Eqn. 51.

Note that Imai’s result agrees with Eqn. 42 at lowest order, the only order to which Oseen’s

equation really applies. A priori, his result is neither better nor worse than any other solution

of Oseen’s equation. It is simply diﬀerent.

e. Discussion

We have presented Oseen’s governing equations for low Reynold number ﬂuid ﬂow. These

equations are a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes’ equations. We have also

presented a number of diﬀerent solutions, for both stream functions and drag coeﬃcients;

each of these solutions comes from a unique set of approximations. The approximations

which have been made can be put into the following broad categories:

• The governing equation — Oseen’s equation approximates the Navier-Stokes equa-

tions.

derivation.

• Solutions which only satisfy the Oseen’s equation approximately.

• Solutions which only satisfy the boundary conditions approximately.

• Solutions where the stream function is expanded in a power series about R = 0 after

• Approximations in the drag coeﬃcient derivation.

• Drag coeﬃcients which were expanded in a power series about R = 0 after their

42

The ﬁrst approximation is in the governing equations. Oseen’s approximation is an ad

hoc approximation which, although it can be shown to be self-consistent, requires unusual

cleverness to obtain. Because it is not derived systematically, it can be diﬃcult to understand

either its applicability or the limitations of its solutions. There have been years of discussion

and confusion about both the equation and its solutions. The short answer is this: Oseen’s

governing equation is a zeroth order uniformly valid approximation to the Navier Stokes

equation; the equation and its solutions are valid only at O (R0).

It is not easy to prove this claim rigorously (Fax´en, 1923). However, it can be easily

shown that Oseen’s equations are self-consistent with its solutions, and that the error in

the solution is of O (R1). One way to explicitly demonstrate this is by substituting a

solution of Oseen’s equation into the LHS of the Navier-Stokes equations (Eqn. 6), thereby

estimating the contribution of inertial terms for the ﬂow ﬁeld characterized by the solution.

By repeating that substitution into the LHS of Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 35), one can estimate

the contribution of inertial terms under Oseen’s approximations. Comparing the two results

gives an estimate of the inaccuracies in Oseen’s governing equations.

Concretely, for the sphere, we substitute Eqn. 38 into the RHS of Eqn. 36, and into the

RHS of Eqn. 12. The diﬀerence between the two results is of O (R1).

For the cylinder, substitute Eqn. 44 into the RHS of Eqns. 37 and 9. The diﬀerence

between the exact and approximate inertial terms is of O (Rδ), where δ is deﬁned as in Eqn.

44.

These conclusions do not depend on the choice of solution (or on the number of terms

retained in Eqn. 44). They explicitly show that the governing equation is only valid to O (R)

(or O (Rδ)). Consequently, the solutions can only be meaningful to the same order, and the

boundary conditions need only be satisﬁed to that order. With these considerations, almost

all of the solutions in the preceding section are equivalent. The only ones which are not —

such as Eqn. 41 — are those in which the solution itself has been further approximated.13

Since the formulae for determining CD (Eqns. 19 and 24) are of the form 1/R + terms

linear in stream function + nonlinear terms, a stream function which is valid to O (R) will

result in a drag coeﬃcient which is valid to O (R0). Thus, in all of the formula for CD which

13 In this case, the Bessel functions have been expanded near R = 0 and are no longer well behaved as

R → ∞.

43

have been presented so far, only the ﬁrst term is meaningful. For a sphere, this is the Stokes’

drag (Eqn. 29), and for the cylinder, Lamb’s results (Eqn. 42).

We have concluded that it is only good fortune that Oseen’s new “3/8R” term is actually

correct. This concurs with the analysis of Proudman et al., who wrote, “Strictly, Oseen’s

method gives only the leading term ... and is scarcely to be counted as superior to Stokes’s

method for the purpose of obtaining the drag.” (Proudman and Pearson, 1957) Proudman

and Pearson also note that the vast eﬀort expended ﬁnding exact solutions to Oseen’s equa-

tion is “of limited value.” Goldstein’s formula for CD, for instance, is expanded to O (R5),

well beyond the accuracy of the original governing equations. The reason for Oseen’s good

fortune is rooted in the symmetry of the problem. Chester and Van Dyke both observe that

the non-linear terms which Oseen’s calculation neglects, while needed for a correct stream

function, do not contribute to the drag because of symmetry (Chester, 1962; Van Dyke,

1975).

Lindgren argues Fax´en proved that, when the boundary conditions are met properly and

Oseen’s equations solved exactly, the resulting CD is that obtained by Stokes (Eqn. 29)

(Lindgren, 1999). Whether this argument is correct does not matter, as Oseen’s additional

term is beyond the accuracy of his governing equations.

There is another approximation which arises while computing CD in the context of Oseen’s

equation. Many workers (e.g., (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950)) compute the pressure in Eqns. 19

and 24 by integrating Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 35, rather than the Navier-Stokes equations

(Eqn. 6). In Eqns. 20 and 25, we presented a pressure calculation based on the Navier

Stokes equations. Calculating pressure using the linearized Oseen equation introduces an

additional approximation into CD. While not necessarily problematic or inconsistent, this

approximation can be diﬃcult to identify.

f. Two diﬀerent interpretations One criticism of the Oseen equation is that it may be

obtained by linearizing the Navier-Stokes equations, without regard to the magnitude of
inertial and viscous terms. By writing ~u = ~U∞ + δ~u, treating δ~u as a small perturbation, and

expanding Eqn. 6 one can formally reproduce Oseen’s equations. Clearly, the disturbance

to the uniform stream is not negligible near the surface of the solid body, and therefore

Oseen’s equations “would appear to be a poor approximation in the neighborhood of the

body where the boundary condition ~u = 0 requires that the true inertial term be small.”

(Happel and Brenner, 1973)

44

This incorrect argument, put forth as a reason to use Stokes’ solutions, overlooks the

origins of Oseen’s equations. The point of Oseen’s approximation is that inertial terms

are only signiﬁcant at large values of |r|, where R|r| is no longer negligible. Near the

surface of the solid, the approximate inertial terms which Oseen introduced are negligible in

comparison to the viscous terms, because they are multiplied by the factor R (in the LHS of

Eqn. 35). Hence the diﬀerence between Oseen’s and Stokes’ equations in the neighborhood

of the sphere will be of O (R), and is beyond the scope of either theory.

g. Better approximations

The approach of Whitehead was essentially to improve Stokes’ solution for the sphere

in an iterative fashion (Whitehead, 1888). By substituting the ﬁrst approximation into the

governing equations, he estimated the neglected terms. He then tried, and failed, to solve

the resulting governing equation. This approach fails because the Stokes’ equations are not

uniformly valid to zeroth order.

Oseen’s equations are uniformly valid, and, as Proudman remarked, “there seems little

reason to doubt that Whitehead’s iterative method, using Oseen’s equation rather than

Stokes’s equation would yield an expansion, each successive term of which would represent a

uniformly valid higher approximation to the ﬂow. In each step of the iteration, a lower-order

approximation would be used to calculate those particular inertia terms that are neglected

... the expansion generated in this way would seem to be the most economic expansion

possible.” (Proudman and Pearson, 1957)

Proudman did not follow through on this idea, instead developing a solution based on

matched asymptotics expansions (see below). In an appendix, Van Dyke relates the unpub-

lished work of C. R. Illingworth (1947) (Van Dyke, 1975). Illingworth carried through White-

head’s program, deriving a new expression (Eqn. 52) for CD, which agrees to O (R2 ln R)

with the later results of matched asymptotic calculations (Eqn. 55).

(cid:19)

Although this result has since been subsumed by matched asymptotics, it is nonetheless

remarkable, substantially improving any previous drag calculations, and rigorously justifying

Oseen’s 3/8R term.

There have also been eﬀorts (e.g., (Shanks, 1955; Van Dyke, 1970)) to “re-sum” Gold-

stein’s series expansion for CD (Eqn. 48). However, these results have little intrinsic (as

45

opposed to methodological) value, as Goldstein’s result is only valid to O (R). If applied to

more accurate approximations, such as Eqn. 52, these methods could be worthwhile. Alas,

even improved approximations lack a suﬃcient numbers of terms in the expression for CD

to make this practicable.

h. Summary

Simply put, Oseen’s equations resolved the paradoxes of Stokes and Whitehead, put

Stokes’ results on ﬁrm theoretical ground, and led to the ﬁrst solution for the drag on a

cylinder. Although the Oseen equations happen to provide a uniformly valid ﬁrst approxi-

mation, it is diﬃcult to extend this work to higher order approximations.

Figure 8 compares the “predictions” of Oseen theory to experimental and numerical

data for the drag on a sphere. Again, Oseen’s ﬁrst order theory is, strictly speaking, not

adequate to make the predictions with which it is traditionally credited. The theoretical

drag coeﬃcients are roughly valid for R . 0.2, with Goldstein’s solution (Eqn. 48) being

slightly better than Oseen’s prediction (Eqn. 39). All are clearly superior to Stokes’ formula

(Eqn. 29).

numerical results.

Figure 8 also shows the prediction of Illingworth’s second order Oseen theory (Eqn. 52).

Not surprisingly, it gives the best prediction of CD, particularly when compared to Dennis’

Figure 9 shows the important predictions of Oseen theory for the drag on an inﬁnite

cylinder. As with the sphere, the theory is only truly entitled to predict the lowest order

term. Figure 9 shows decent agreement with the data. Although more “exact” solutions

(such as Bairstow’s and Imai’s) do better than Lamb’s lowest order solution, this is purely

coincidental. Tomotika’s solutions exhibit similar characteristics to these two solutions.

3. Matched asymptotics

Eﬀorts to systematically improve Oseen’s results led to the development of matched

asymptotic expansions.14 This branch of applied mathematics was developed gradually,

with systematic work beginning with papers by Kaplun and Lagerstrom et al. (Kaplun,

1954; Lagerstrom and Cole, 1955). Kaplun subsequently used these techniques to calculate

14 This technique is also known as the method of inner and outer expansions or double asymptotic expansions.

the drag on a cylinder, obtaining an entirely new result for CD (Lagerstrom et al., 1967).

Proudman and Pearson subsequently applied matched asymptotics to both the sphere and

the cylinder, deriving a new result for the drag on a sphere (Proudman and Pearson, 1957).

“The principle of asymptotic matching is simple. The interval on which a

boundary-value problem is posed is broken into a sequence of two or more over-

lapping subintervals. Then, on each subinterval perturbation theory is used to

obtain an asymptotic approximation to the solution of the diﬀerential equation

valid on that interval. Finally, the matching is done by requiring that the asymp-

totic approximations have the same functional form on the overlap of every pair

or intervals. This gives a sequence of asymptotic approximations ... the end

result is an approximate solution to a boundary-value problem valid over the

entire interval” (Bender and Orzag, 1999).

Both of the two low Reynolds number problems are attacked in similar fashion. The

problem is divided into only two regions. The ﬁrst region is near the surface of the solid

body. In this region, inertial terms are small, the approximation of Stokes (R ≈ 0) applies,

and the problem is solved perturbatively (in R). At each order in R, the two no-slip boundary

conditions at the surface are applied. One undetermined constant remains (at each order

in R). Loosely speaking, it is determined by the boundary condition as |~r| → ∞. This

expansion is referred to as the Stokes expansion.

The second region is far from the sphere, where inertial terms are important.

In this

region, R|r| ∼ O (1), and the approximations which led to Oseen’s governing equation

apply. The Oseen problem is then solved perturbatively, and the boundary condition as

|~r| → ∞ is applied. There are two undetermined constants remaining; they are related to

the boundary conditions on the surface. This perturbative expansion is referred to as the

Oseen expansion.

48

The next part of this calculation is asymptotic matching, which determines the remaining

coeﬃcients.15

In this process, we expand the Oseen expansion for small R|~r|, and the

Stokes expansion for large |~r|. By choosing the three hitherto undetermined coeﬃcients

appropriately, these two limiting forms are made to agree order by order in R. For this

to be possible, the two asymptotic functional forms must overlap. With the coeﬃcients

determined, the two unique, locally valid perturbative approximations are complete.

If

desired, they can be combined to make a single uniformly valid approximation.

While straightforward in theory, asymptotic matching is diﬃcult in practice, particularly

for an equation like the Navier-Stokes equation. However, it is still far simpler than alter-

natives, such as iteratively solving the Oseen equations. Van Dyke’s book is an excellent

presentation of the many subtleties which arise in applying matched asymptotics to problems

in ﬂuid mechanics (Van Dyke, 1975). We now present the matched asymptotic solutions for

Eqns. 9 and 12. These solutions result in the “state of the art” drag coeﬃcients for both

the sphere and the cylinder.

a. Sphere

Although Lagerstrom and Cole initially applied matched asymptotics to the problem of

the sphere, the seminal work came in an elegant 1957 paper by Proudman and Pearson

(Lagerstrom and Cole, 1955; Proudman and Pearson, 1957). Chester and Breach extended

this paper via a diﬃcult calculation in 1969 (Chester and Breach, 1969). We summarize the

results of both papers here. These workers used a perturbative solution in the Stokes regime

of the form:

ψ(r, µ) = ψ0 + Rψ1 + R2 log Rψ2L + R2ψ2 + R3 log R + R3ψ3 + O

(53)

This rather peculiar perturbative form cannot be determined a priori. Rather, it arose in a

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

fastidious incremental fashion, calculating one term at a time. The procedure of asymptotic

matching required including terms like R2 log R in the expansion; otherwise, no matching is

possible. Note that matched asymptotics gives no explanation for the origin of these singular

The ﬁrst step to ﬁnding a perturbative solution in the Oseen region is to deﬁne the Oseen

15 At this point, there are two unknown coeﬃcients in the Oseen expansion, and one in the Stokes expansion.

ρ = Rr,

Ψ(ρ, µ) = R2ψ(r, µ)

49

Part of the reason for this transformation can be understood via the derivation of the Oseen

equation. The region where inertial eﬀects become important has been shown to be where

R|r| ∼ O (1). Intuitively, the variable ρ = Rr is a natural choice to analyze this regime,

as it will be of O (1). The precise reasons for the selection of these variables is a technique

from boundary layer theory known as a dominant balance argument. See Bender and Orzag

for a detailed explanation. This argument will also be revisited in subsequent sections

(Bender and Orzag, 1999).

The perturbative expansion in the Oseen takes the form:

Ψ(ρ, µ) = Ψ0 + RΨ1 + R2Ψ2 + R3 log RΨ3L + O

R3

(54)

Note that there is no R2 log R term in this expansion; none is required to match with the

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Stokes expansion. As with the Stokes expansion, this form cannot be determined a priori.

Proudman and Pearson completely solved for the Stokes’ expansion through O(R log R),

and partially solved for the O (R2) term. They determined the Oseen expansion through

O (R). Chester and Breach extended these results up to a partial solution for O (R3) in the

Stokes’ expansion, and to O (R3 log R) in the Oseen expansion.

The exact form of these expansions is given in Chester and Breach.16 Some aspects of

these results have been seen before: The leading order in the Stokes’ expansion (ψ0) is simply

the Stokes solution (Eqn. 28). In the Oseen expansion, Ψ0 is simply the formula for the

uniform stream expressed in Oseen variables. The second term, Ψ1, is the rotational part of

Oseen’s solution (Eqn. 38).

FIG. 10 (Color online) Drag on a sphere, experiment vs. matched asymptotic theory. Experimental

and numerical results are plotted as in Figure 8.

Here γ is Euler’s constant. This formula reproduces and extends nearly all earlier work.

Eqn. 55 shows both the original results of Proudman and Pearson and the higher order

contributions of Chester and Breach (Chester and Breach, 1969; Proudman and Pearson,

1957). The “Stokes” term is Stokes’ original result (Eqn. 29), which was rigorously justiﬁed

by Oseen. The “Oseen” term is generally credited to Oseen (Eqn. 39), although it is really

beyond the accuracy of his work, and is only justiﬁed by this calculation.17

Figure 10 compares the results of matched asymptotics (Eqn. 55) with experimental

data, numerical results, and the basic prediction of Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 39). This plot

has been the source of some confusion. Maxworthy examined his data and concluded that

CD as computed by Oseen and Goldstein (Eqn. 48) were as good as any matched asymp-

totics predictions (Maxworthy, 1965). The calculations of Dennis and Le Clair, however,

refute that claim, and demonstrate the systematic improvement that results from matched

asymptotics.

Neither is it immediately clear that the extra terms in Eqn. 55 due to Chester and

Breach are actually any improvement on the work of Proudman and Pearson. Van Dyke

notes, “This result is disappointing, because comparison with experiment suggests that the

range of applicability has scarcely been increased.” (Van Dyke, 1975), and Chester himself

remarks that “there is little point in continuing the expansion further.” At very low Reynolds

17 Illingworth’s unpublished result also justiﬁes this term.

51

number, however, the results of Dennis “indicate that the expression of Chester and Breach

gives a better approximation to the drag coeﬃcient than any other asymptotic solution until

about [R = 0.3].” (Dennis and Walker, 1971) Figure 10 shows the excellent low R agreement

between Dennis’ numerical results and Eqn. 55.

The prediction of matched asymptotics (Eqn. 55) is close to Illingworth’s second order

Oseen theory (Eqn. 52). Close examination shows that the matched asymptotics results

are slightly closer to the Dennis’ calculations in the limit of low Reynolds number. Strictly

speaking, these two theories should only be compared as r → 0, and in this regime matched

asymptotics is superior. This is not surprising, as the best matched asymptotic calculation

is a higher order approximation than that of Illingworth.

b. Cylinder

In 1957, Kaplun applied matched asymptotics to the problem of the cylinder, and

produced the ﬁrst new result for CD (Kaplun, 1957). Additional stream function

calculations (but without a drag coeﬃcient) were done by Proudman and Pearson

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957). Kaplun’s calculations were extended to higher order by

Skinner, whose work also explored the structure of the asymptotic expansions (Skinner,

1975). We summarize results from all three papers here.

Near the surface of the cylinder, the Stokes’ expansion applies, and the perturbative

solution takes the following form.

ψ(r, θ) = ψ0(r, θ, δ) + Rψ2(r, θ, δ) + R2ψ3(r, θ, δ) + O

R3

(56)

Here, δ = δ(R) is deﬁned as in Eqn. 41. What is remarkable about the structure of

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

this expansion is its dependence on δ. To be precise, each function ψn is actually another

perturbative expansion, in δ:

ψn(r, θ, δ) = δFn,1(r, θ) + δ2Fn,2(r, θ) + O

δ3

This formulation is equivalent to an asymptotic expansion in terms of log R−1, which is used

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

by Proudman and Pearson:

ψn(r, θ, log R) =

˜Fn,1(r, θ)
(log R)1 +

˜Fn,2(r, θ)
(log R)2 + O

1
(log R)3

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

This form is much less eﬃcient than that given in Eqn. 57, in the sense that more terms

in the Stokes and Oseen expansions are needed to obtain a given number of terms in CD.

For that reason, expansions in δ are used here.

(57)

(58)

52

This curious asymptotic form is necessitated by matching requirements.

It is also the

source of a number of bizarre complications. The ﬁrst implication is that all terms in

Eqn. 56 of O (R) and higher will be transcendentally smaller than any of the terms in the

expansion for ψ0. This is true asymptotically, as R → 0. The reason for this is that inertial

terms never enter into any of the governing equations for the Stokes’ expansion; they enter

only through the matching process with the Oseen expansion.

As with the sphere, the ﬁrst step to ﬁnding a perturbative solution in the Oseen region

is to transform into the relevant Oseen variables. In this case,

ρ = Rr,

Ψ(ρ, µ) = Rψ(r, µ)

The perturbative expansion which can solve the problem in the Oseen region has the same

generic form as Eqn. 56.

Ψ(ρ, θ) = Ψ0(ρ, θ, δ) + RΨ1(ρ, θ, δ) + O

R2

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

The functions Ψn(ρ, θ, δ) can also be expressed as a series in δ(R). However, the formula

cannot be written down as conveniently as it could in Eqn. 57. The ﬁrst two terms take the

forms given in Eqn. 61.

Ψ0(ρ, θ, δ) = F0,0(ρ, θ) + δF0,1(ρ, θ) + O

δ2

Ψ1(ρ, θ, δ) = δ−1F1,−1(ρ, θ) + F0,0(ρ, θ) + O (δ)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(59)

(60)

(61a)

(61b)

Kaplun and Proudman both considered only terms of O (R0) in the Stokes’ expansion. As

R → 0, this is an excellent approximation, as all higher terms are transcendentally smaller.

In this limit, the Stokes expansion takes a particularly simple form:

ψ(r, θ) = ψ1(r, θ, δ) =

Kaplun obtained terms up to and including n = 3. Proudman et al. also obtained expressions

for the Oseen expansion, albeit expressed as a series in log R−1. Skinner extended Kaplun’s

Stokes expansion to include terms up to O (δ3), O (Rδ), and O (R2δ) (Skinner, 1975). He

obtained approximate solutions for the Oseen expansion, including terms up to O (δ) and

O (R). The lowest order solutions in the Oseen expansion are related to the expression for

a uniform stream and the solution of Lamb (Eqn. 41).

53

Using his solution, Kaplun computed a new result for the drag coeﬃcient (Eqn. 63) which

agrees with Lamb’s result (Eqn. 42) at lowest order.

results, showed that terms of O (R0) do not contribute to the drag, and calculated the ﬁrst
R

transcendentally smaller contribution, which is of O (R1). His result is given in Eqn. 64.

The value of these new terms is questionable, and Skinner himself noted that they are

likely negligible in comparison to the neglected terms of O (δ4). Asymptotically this is

unequivocally true.

Figure 11 compares the predictions of matched asymptotic theory with Lamb’s result

(Eqn. 42) based on Oseen’s equation. Although both theories agree as r → 0, matched

asymptotic results seem no better than Lamb’s solution. The comparison is further compli-

cated by the scatter in the diﬀerent experiments; matched asymptotics agree more closely

with Tritton’s measurements, while Lamb’s solution agrees better with Jayaweera’s. We

draw two conclusions from Figure 11: Both theories break down for R & 0.1 and nei-

ther theory is demonstrably more accurate. Even more disappointingly, Skinner’s result is

nowhere better than Kaplun’s — it is actually worse at higher Reynolds numbers.

Part of the problem with the matched asymptotics approach arises from the need for two

expansions, in δ and R. Because inﬁnitely many orders of δ are needed before any higher

orders in R are relevant means that inﬁnitely many terms in the Oseen expansion must be

calculated before the second order term in the Stokes expansion. This is ineﬃcient, and is

the reason for Skinner’s lack of success.

A recent paper by Keller et al. solved this problem numerically (Keller and Ward, 1996).

They developed a method to sum all of the orders of δ for the ﬁrst two orders of R. Their

“beyond all orders” numerical results prove the importance of these higher order terms.

When such terms are accounted for, the resulting CD is vastly improved from Kaplun’s, and

is superior to any of the analytic solutions discussed here. Interestingly, it seems to agree

very well with the experiments of Tritton, although it is diﬃcult to tell from the plot in

their paper, which does not remove the leading order divergence.

4. Other theories

Amongst the community interested in settling velocities and sedimentation, there are

many theoretical models of the drag on a sphere. These workers specify CD as a function of

R by means of a “sphere drag correlation.” An overview of these formula is given by Brown

(Brown and Lawler, 2003). These results are generally semi-empirical, relying on a blend

of theoretical calculations and phenomenologically ﬁt parameters to predict CD over a large

range of Reynolds number. While practically useful, these results are not speciﬁc to low

Reynolds numbers, and cannot be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. They address

a diﬀerent problem, and will not be further considered here.

One other semi-empirical theory is due to Carrier (Carrier, 1953). He argued that the

inertial corrections in the Oseen equation were over-weighted, and multiplied them by a

coeﬃcient which he constrained to be between 0 and 1. Consequently, his theory is in

some sense “in between” that of Stokes and that of Oseen. He ultimately determined this

coeﬃcient empirically.

55

5. Terminology

Confusing terminology, particularly in the matched asymptotics literature, riddles the

history of these problems. We previously detailed discrepancies in the deﬁnition of CD.

In this section we explain the sometimes conﬂicting terms used in the matched asymptotics

literature, adopt a convention which eliminates confusion, and also explain how some authors

adopt diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the Reynolds’ number.

Matched asymptotics literature discusses numerous perturbative expansions, each of

which are valid in a diﬀerent regime, or “domain of validity.” Diﬀerent authors use dif-

ferent labels for these expansions. Most workers deﬁne the “inner” expansion to be the

expansion which is valid inside the boundary layer (Bender and Orzag, 1999). A boundary

layer is a region of rapid variation in the solution. The “outer” expansion is valid outside of

the boundary layer, where the solution is slowly varying (Bender and Orzag, 1999). Prob-

lems with multiple boundary layers require additional terminology. The outer expansion is

based “upon the primary reference quantities in the problem,” and the inner expansion is

usually obtained by stretching the original variables by dimensionless functions of the per-

turbation parameter (Van Dyke, 1975). The appropriate stretching, or scaling functions are

obtained through a dominant balance analysis, which can be diﬃcult. After this rescaling,

the argument of the inner expansion will be of O(1) inside the boundary layer. Accompany-

ing these inner and outer expansions are “inner variables”, “outer variables”, “inner limits”,

and “outer limits”.

The low Reynolds number ﬂow problems are complicated by the fact that some authors,

including Van Dyke, also deﬁne expansions on the basis of their physical location (Van Dyke,

1975). The “outer” limit is valid far from the solid body (|~r| is large), and the “inner” limit

is valid near the surface of the body (|~r| ≈ 1).

This is consistent with yet another deﬁnition, based on proximity to the origin of the

chosen coordinate system.

In a review paper Lagerstrom and Casten deﬁne the “inner

limit” as being “valid near the origin,” and the “outer limit” as being “valid except near

the origin.” (Lagerstrom and Casten, 1972) Part of their motivation for this new deﬁnition

was to distinguish between the domain of validity of an expansion, and the limit process by

which it is obtained.

Finally, Kaplun refers to the inner and outer limits based on their correspondence to

56

high Reynolds number ﬂow (Kaplun, 1957). He identiﬁes the Stokes’ approximation as the

“inner” limit, and Oseen’s equation as the “outer” limit.

Part of the confusion arises because of disagreements over the location of the boundary

layer. Van Dyke claims that “it is the neighborhood of the point at inﬁnity”, while Kaplun

argues that the boundary layer is near the surface. Deﬁnitions referenced to the boundary

layer disagree when there are disagreements about its location.

To eliminate this confusion, a preferable alternative notation has emerged from

the work of both Kaplun and Proudman et al.

(Kaplun and Lagerstrom, 1957;

Proudman and Pearson, 1957). We follow this notation, deﬁning the “Oseen” and “Stokes”

expansions, which were used in the previous section. The Oseen expansion is valid far from

the surface, and is expressed in stretched coordinates. The Stokes limit is valid near the

surface of the sphere, where r is small, and is expressed in the original variables.18

Matched asymptotics workers also discuss uniform approximations, intermediate expan-

sions, or composite expansions (Bender and Orzag, 1999; Lagerstrom et al., 1967; Van Dyke,

1975). The basic idea is that the Stokes and Oseen expansions can be blended together to

form a single expression which is valid everywhere. This result reduces to the two original

expansions when expanded asymptotically in the two limits. How to calculate a uniform

expansion is discused below.

There are also minor diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of the Reynolds number, R. Some

authors deﬁne R based on the diameter of the solid, while others base it on the radius. This

factor of 2 can be diﬃcult to track. We deﬁne the Reynolds number using the radius of

the ﬁxed body: R = |~u∞|a/ν. It is worth noting that Kaplun (Lagerstrom et al., 1967),

Tomotika (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950), Goldstein (Goldstein, 1965), Liebster (Liebster, 1927),

Thom (Thom, 1933) and Tritton (Tritton, 1959) all use the diameter.

C. Uniformly valid approximations

As mentioned previously, the inner and outer expansions may be combined into a single,

uniformly valid approximation, which is applicable everywhere. For a function of one vari-

able, the uniform approximation is constructed as in Eqn. 65 (Bender and Orzag, 1999).

18 Van Dyke’s book is not consistent in relating “inner” and “outer” expansions to the Stokes and Oseen

expansions.

57

yuniform(x) = youter(x) + yinner(x) − yoverlap(x)

(65)

yoverlap(x) consists of the the common “matching” terms between the inner and outer ex-

pansions.

Kaplun demonstrates that yuniform(x) → y(x) as the expansion variable R → 0, i.e. the

uniform approximation tends to the exact solution everywhere (Lagerstrom et al., 1967). To

be more precise, if the matched asymptotics solution is constructed to O (R1), then

y(x) − yuniform(x) ∼ O

R1

lim
R→0

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

As a matter of practice, calculating the uniform solution is mechanistic. First, express

the inner and outer expansions in the same coordinates; in our case, express the Oseen

expansion in Stokes variables.19 Alternatively, one can express the Stokes expansion in

Oseen variables. Next, express both solutions as a power series in the expansion parameter,

R. By construction the Stokes expansion is already in this form but the transformed Oseen

expansion is not, and must be expanded to the same power in R as the Stokes solution.

From these two power series we can identify the “overlap” function, yoverlap. This function

consists of the terms which are in common between the two expansions, and is usually

obtained by inspection. Of course, yoverlap is only valid to the same order as the original

matched asymptotics solution, and higher order terms should be discarded. The uniformly

valid approximation is then obtained using yoverlap and Eqn. 65.

1. The correct way to calculate CD

Proudman and Pearson argue that “uniformly valid approximations per se are not usually

of much physical interest ... In the present problem, for instance, it is the Stokes expansion

that gives virtually all the physically interesting information.” (Proudman and Pearson,

1957) All matched asymptotics calculations are based solely on the Stokes expansion, and

are therefore inﬂuenced by the Oseen expansion only via the boundary conditions. For

instance, the drag coeﬃcient is calculated using only the Stokes’ expansion. Other properties

19 Note that this transformation aﬀects both the radial coordinates and the stream function, and that it

diﬀers for the sphere and cylinder.

58

of the stream function, such as the size of the dead water wake directly behind the sphere

or cylinder, are also calculated using the Stokes’ expansion.

In this section we argue that this approach is incorrect, and that uniformly valid approx-

imation should be used to calculate all quantities of interest. By adopting this viewpoint,

we obtain new results for CD, and demonstrate that these drag coeﬃcients systematically

improve on previous matched asymptotics results.

Matched asymptotics workers argue that the drag coeﬃcient is calculated at the surface

of the solid (Eqns. 24, 19), where r = 1. Since the Oseen solution applies for large r, the

Stokes solution applies for small r, and the Stokes solution ought to be used to calculate

CD. In fact, by construction, any uniformly valid approximation must reduce to the Stokes

expansion in the limit as Rr → 0.

Curiously, proponents of

the Oseen equation argue

conversely (Fax´en, 1927;

Happel and Brenner, 1973). They claim that because the Oseen expansion happens to ap-

ply everywhere, it should be used to calculate all sorts of quantities of interest, includ-

ing CD.

In fact, Hapel and Brenner wrote a book essentially devoted to this premise

(Happel and Brenner, 1973).

In fairness, it must be mentioned that all of these authors

were aware of their choices, and motivated their approach pragmatically: They obtained

useful solutions to otherwise intractable problems.

In reality, both approaches converge to the exact solution for suitably small Reynolds’

numbers. However, for small but non-inﬁnitesimal R, the best estimate of derivative quan-

tities such as CD is obtained not by using the Stokes expansion, but by using a uniformly

valid approximation calculated with both the Stokes and Oseen expansions. Such a drag

coeﬃcient must agree with results derived from the Stokes expansion as Rr → 0, and it

can never be inferior. Moreover, this approach makes determination of the drag coeﬃcient’s

accuracy straightforward; it is determined solely by the accuracy of the uniform expansion,

without any need to be concerned about its domain of applicability.

We now calculate the drag coeﬃcients for both the sphere and the cylinder using uni-

formly valid approximations, using previously published inner and outer expansions. These

corrections are small but methodologically noteworthy, and are absent from the existing

literature.

a. Cylinder

Although the state-of-the-art matched asymptotics solutions are due to Kaplun, it is more

59

convenient to use stream functions (Kaplun, 1957). Skinner conveniently combines previous

work, providing a concise summary of Stokes and Oseen stream functions (Skinner, 1975).

We base our derivation of a uniformly valid approximation on the results in his paper. The

Stokes expansion is given by Eqn. 66 (Skinner, 1975).

forward. The only subtlety is the sine series in Eqn. 67. However, Eqn. 21 tells us that, for

the purposes of calculating the drag, only the coeﬃcient of sin θ matters. We calculate the

Fig. 12 compares Eqn. 70 with Kaplun’s usual result (Eqn. 63). The new drag coeﬃcient

(Eqn. 70) is a small but systematic improvement over the results of Kaplun. Because they

are asymptotically identical up to O (δ4) and O (R), they agree as R → 0. However, at

small but non-inﬁnitesimal R, our new result is superior. Comparing Figures 12 and 11, we

can also see a second surprise: The new result betters Skinner’s CD, even though they were

based on the same stream functions. If Skinner had used a uniformly valid approximation,

his result would not have misleadingly appeared inferior to Kaplun’s.

b. Sphere

As with the cylinder, calculating CD from a uniformly valid expansion yields an improved

result. However, there is a substantial diﬀerence in this case. Although matched asymptotics

calculations have been done through O (R3) in Eqn. 53 and O (R3 log R) in Eqn. 54, the

higher order terms in the Oseen expansion are impossible to express in a simple analytic

form. Asymptotic expressions exist (and have been used for matching), but these cannot

be used to construct a uniformly valid expansion. Consequently, we can only compute the

uniform expansion through O (R), and its predictions can only be meaningfully compared

to the ﬁrst two terms in Eqn. 55.

The solutions for the Stokes and Oseen expansions are given in Chester and Breach, and

are quoted here (Chester and Breach, 1969). The Stokes expansion:

This result is plotted in Figure 13. Asymptotically, it agrees with the matched asymp-

totics predictions to O (1), as it must, and reproduces the 3/8R “Oseen” term. As R

increases, however, the uniform calculation becomes superior to the ﬁrst two terms of the

matched asymptotic CD. Although it is a much higher order solution than either of the

other two results, we show the full matched asymptotics prediction for comparison.

III. THE RENORMALIZATION GROUP APPLIED TO LOW R FLOW

A. Introduction to the renormalization group

In 1961, Lagerstrom proposed the ﬁrst of a number of “model problems”, ordinary diﬀer-

ential equations which exhibited many of the same asymptotic features as the low Reynolds

number problems. They were used to study and develop the theory of matched asymptotic

expansions. The mathematical solution of these problems is closely analogous to the actual

solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.

Le Clair and Hamielec, 1970; Maxworthy, 1965).

A review of these equations, and of their matched asymptotic solutions, is given in Lager-

strom (Lagerstrom and Casten, 1972). The relevent models can be summarized by the fol-

lowing equation:

(76)

This ODE is subject to the boundary conditions u(ǫ) = 1, u(∞) = 0. In this equation,

n corresponds to the number of spatial dimensions (n = 2 for the cylinder, n = 3 for the

sphere). δ = 0 characterizes incompressible ﬂow, and δ = 1 corresponds to compressible ﬂow.

This equation is similar to the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in Oseen variables. There

are fundamental diﬀerences between the structure of the incompressible and compressible

ﬂow equations.

These model problems are posed in Hinch, albeit in terms of “Stokes” (rather than

“Oseen”) variables (Hinch, 1991). Hinch begins by examining the model describing incom-

pressible ﬂow past a sphere. He next examines incompressible ﬂow past a cylinder, which he

calls “A worse problem.” Finally, he treats compressible ﬂow past cylinder, which he dubs

63

“A terrible problem.”

These problems, which have historically been the proving ground of matched asymptotics,

were recently solved using new techniques in two papers by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 1994b,

1996). These papers solved two of these model problems using perturbative techniques

based on the renormalization group (RG). These techniques aﬀord both quantitative and

methodological advantages over traditional matched asymptotics. The RG approach derives

all of the subtle terms (e.g., R2 log R) which arise during asymptotic matching, demonstrat-

ing that origin of these terms lies in the need to correct ﬂaws inherent in the underlying

expansions. Moreover, RG does not require multiple rescalings of variables, and its results,

while asymptotically equivalent to those of matched asymptotics, apply over a much larger

range (e.g., they extend to higher R).

In particular, Chen et al. solved Hinch’s ﬁrst model, which describes incompressible ﬂow

past a sphere (n = 3, δ = 0), as well as the model for both kinds of ﬂow past a cylinder

(n = 2, δ = 0, 1) (Chen et al., 1994b, 1996).

In a notation consistent with Hinch, they

termed these models the “Stokes-Oseen caricature” and the “terrible problem.”

The dramatic success of the RG techniques in solving the model problems inspired their

application to the original low Reynold number ﬂow problems. That is our primary pur-

pose here, as the low Reynold number problems are the traditional proving ground for

new methodologies. We will show that the RG techniques perform well when applied to

these problems. RG produces results superior to the predictions of matched asymptotics.

More importantly, the RG calculations are considerably simpler than matched asymptotics,

requiring half the work.

The utility of the RG approach is most easily seen through an example, which will also

provide a framework for understanding the analysis presented in subsequent sections. Sev-

eral pedagogical examples can also be found in the references (e.g., (Chen et al., 1994b),

(Chen et al., 1996), and (Oono, 2000)). We begin here with an analysis of the most com-

plicated model problem, the “terrible problem,” which caricatures compressible ﬂow past a

cylinder.

64

1. Detailed analysis of the “terrible problem”

Although the “terrible problem,” is solved in a paper by Chen et al., we re-examine it here

in considerably more detail, as its solution is closely analogous to those of the low Reynold

number ﬂow problems. This switchback problem is exceptionally delicate20, requiring the

calculation of an inﬁnite number of terms for the leading order asymptotic matching.

There are pitfalls and ambiguities in applying RG techniques, even to the “terrible prob-

lem,” which while terrible, is considerably simpler than the real low Reynolds number prob-

lems. Understanding these subtleties in this simpler context provides essential guidance

when attacking the Navier-Stokes’ equations.

We want to solve the ODE given in Eqn. 77a, subject to the boundary conditions 77b.

This equation can be derived from Eqn. 76 by setting n = 2, δ = 1, and transforming to the

“Stokes” variables, r = x/ǫ. Unlike Eqn. 76, Eqn. 77 is obviously a singular perturbation

in ǫ, which has been removed from the boundary conditions. The last term in the equation

vanishes when ǫ = 0.

(77b)

This problem cannot be solved exactly, although numerical solution is straightforward.

Trouble arises due to the boundary layer 21 located near r = ∞. RG analysis requires that

we work in the “inner” variable for our approximation to capture the correct behavior near

the boundary layer. This requirement may also be qualitatively motivated by arguing that

one must choose coordinates to “stretch out” the boundary layer so that it can be well

characterized by our approximate solution.

To determine the appropriate change of variables, we need to analyze Eqn. (77) using a

dominant balance argument (Bender and Orzag, 1999). As it stands, the ﬁrst three terms

of Eqn. (77a) will dominate, since ǫ is small. The rescaling x = ǫr yields inner22 Eqn. (78).

20 Hinch notes, “It is unusual to ﬁnd such a diﬃcult problem ...” (Hinch, 1991).
21 A boundary layer is a region of rapid variation in the solution, y(t).
22 Here we use “inner” in the usual sense (Bender and Orzag, 1999).

The next step in the RG solution is to begin with the ansatz that the solution to Eqn.

(78) can be obtained from a perturbation expansion (Eqn. 79). We fully expect this ansatz

to fail, since we have a singular perturbation in our ODE. We therefore refer to this starting

point as the na¨ıve perturbation expansion.

u(x) = u0(x) + ǫu1(x) + ǫ2u2(x) + O(ǫ3)

a. O(ǫ0) solution

(cid:1)

The ﬁrst complication of the terrible problem arises when we attempt to solve Eqn.

80, a nonlinear ODE. Although one solution — u0(x) = A0 — is seen by inspection, an

additional integration constant is not forthcoming, and our solution to the O(ǫ0) problem

cannot satisfy both of the boundary conditions (Eqn. 78b). The resolution to this quandary

is simple: Ignore the problem and it will go away; continue constructing the na¨ıve solution

as if u0(x) = A0 were wholly satisfactory. The qualitative idea is that the O(ǫ0) solution is

the uniform ﬁeld which we have far from any disturbance source. Why is this acceptable?

The RG method is robust against shortcomings in the na¨ıve expansion. We know that

singular perturbation problems cannot be solved by a single perturbation expansion. We

therefore expect problems, such as secular behavior, to arise in our solution for the na¨ıve

expansion. RG techniques can be used to remove these ﬂaws from the perturbative solution,

turning it into a uniformly valid approximation (Chen et al., 1996).

It does not matter

whether these defects arise from an incomplete solution for u0(x), the intrinsic structure of

66

the equation, or a combination of the two. To solve the terrible problem (and later the low

Reynolds number problems), we must exploit this ﬂexibility.

For subsequent calculations, there are two ways to proceed. First, we may retain A0 as an

arbitrary constant, one which will ultimately be renormalized in the process of calculating a

uniformly valid approximation. Alternatively, we may set A0 = 1, satisfying the boundary

condition at x = ∞.23 This unconventional approach to the RG calculation eﬀectively

shifts the freedom that usually comes with the O(ǫ0) constants of integration into the O(ǫ1)

solution. This artiﬁce greatly simpliﬁes subsequent calculations, and is invaluable in treating

the Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, these two approaches are equivalent, as we now

show.

b. O(ǫ1) solution

If u0(x) = A0, Eqn. 81 simpliﬁes to Eqn. 83.

(83)

The solution is: u1(x) = B0 + B1e1(A0x), where en(x) ≡

x e−tt−ndt. Notice that the ﬁrst
term is linearly dependant on the u0(x) solution. There are many opinions regarding how to
R

∞

utilize this degree of freedom (Kunihiro, 1995; Woodruﬀ, 1995). In our approach, one is free

to choose the homogeneous solutions of u0, u1, etc. for convenience. The only constraint24 is

that the “na¨ıve” solution (Eqn. 79) must have a suﬃcient number of integration constants

to meet the boundary conditions. In this example, that means two constants of integration.

Diﬀerent choices of particular solutions will ultimately result in diﬀerent approximate

solutions to the ODE. However, all of these solutions will agree within the accuracy limita-

tions of the original approximation (in this case the na¨ıve expansion). This can be shown

explicitly. In this example, as in the low Reynolds number problems, we choose a particular

solution which simpliﬁes subsequent calculations. Setting B0 = 0 (note that this is not the

same as a redeﬁnition of the constant A0), we obtain the solution:

u(x) = A0 + ǫB1e1(A0x)

+O(ǫ2)

(84)

divergent as x→0

The second term in Eqn. 84 diverges logarithmically as x → 0. One may argue that this
{z

}

|

divergence is irrelevant, since the range of the original variable is r ∈ [1, ∞), and numerical

23 Meeting the boundary condition at x = ǫ results only in the trivial solution u0(x) = 0.
24 Of course the solution must also satisfy the governing equation.

67

solutions demonstrate that the solutions to Eqn. 77 in [1, ∞) diverge when extended to r < 1.

But the argument that the divergence in Eqn. 84 is an intrinsic part of the solution (and

therefore should not be considered problematic) is incorrect. Although the original variable,

r, is limited to r ∈ [1, ∞), the transformed variable, x = ǫr, has the range x ∈ [0, ∞). This

occurs because there are no restrictions on the lower limit of ǫ. The divergence exhibited

by the second term of Eqn. 84 must be removed via renormalization in order to turn the

ﬂawed na¨ıve solution into a uniformly valid approximation.

This divergence arises for two reasons. First, we are perturbing about an O(ǫ0) solution

which is deﬁcient; it is missing the the second integration constant (and concomitant fun-

damental solution). More fundamentally, Eqn 79 attempts to solve a singular perturbation

problem with a regular expansion, an approach which must fail. The RG technique solves
these problems by restructuring the na¨ive expansion and eliminating the ﬂaws in u0(x).

Although A0 is simply a constant of integration when ǫ = 0, it must be modiﬁed when

ǫ 6= 0. We will absorb the divergences into a modiﬁcation, or renormalization, of the constant

of integration A0. Formally, one begins by “splitting” the secular terms, replacing e1(A0x)

by e1(A0x) − e1(A0τ ) + e1(A0τ ), where τ is an arbitrary position. This results in Eqn. 85:

u(x) = A0 + ǫB1(e1(A0x) − e1(A0τ ) + e1(A0τ )) + O(ǫ2)

(85)

Since τ is arbitrary, it can be chosen such that e1(A0x) − e1(A0τ ) is non-secular (for a given

x). The divergence is now contained in the last term of Eqn. (85), and is exhibited as a

function of τ .

It is dealt with by introducing a multiplicative renormalization constant, Z1 = 1 +
∞
i=1 ai(τ )ǫi, and then renormalizing A0 as A0 = Z1A0(τ ).25 The coeﬃcients ai(τ ) can then
be chosen.26 order by order so as to eliminate the secular term in Eqn. (85) Subsituting,
P

and choosing a1 to eliminate the ﬁnal term of Eqn. 85, we obtain

u(x) = A0(τ ) + ǫB1(e1(A0(τ )x) − e1(A0(τ )τ )) + O(ǫ2)

Where a1 satisﬁes

a1(τ ) =

−B1e1(τ A0(τ )(1 +
A0(τ )

P

∞
i=1 ai(τ )ǫi))

(86)

(87)

25 A0 is the only constant which can be renormalized to remove the divergences, as B1 is proportional to

the secular terms.

26 Note that the coeﬃcients must also be independent of x.

68

Note that to obtain Eqn. 86 we needed to expand e1 about ǫ = 0. Unusually in this

equation, the renormalized constant (A0(τ )) appears in the argument of the exponential

integral; this complicates the calculation. We will later show how to avoid this problem by

restructuring our calculations.

Qualitatively, the idea underlying Eqn. 86 is that boundary conditions far away (from

x = ǫ) are unknown to our solution at x ≫ ǫ, so that A0 is undetermined at x = τ . RG

determines A0 in this regime through the renormalization constant Z1 (which depends on τ ).

Afterward there will be new constants which can be used to meet the boundary conditions.

The RG condition states that the solution u(x) cannot depend on the arbitrary position

τ . This requirement can be implemented in one of two ways. First, since ∂τ u(x) = 0, apply

∂τ to the RHS of Eqn. 86 and set the result equal to zero:

(88)

The next step in RG is to realize Eqn. 88 implies that A

0(τ ) ∼ O(ǫ).27 Retaining only

terms of O(ǫ), we obtain:

dA0(τ )
dτ

+ ǫB1

e−A0(τ )τ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

+ O(ǫ2) = 0

In principle, we simply solve Eqn. 89 for A0(τ ). Unfortunately, that is not possible,

due to the presence of A0(τ ) in the exponential. This complication also occurs in other

switchback problems, as well as in the low Reynolds number problems. Eqn. 89 can be

solved by an iterative approach: Initially set ǫ = 0, and solve for A0(τ ) = α0, a constant.

Next substitute this result into the O(ǫ) term in Eqn. 89, solving for A0(τ ) again:

A0(τ ) = α0 + ǫB1e1(α0τ )

In this solution, we have a new integration constant, α0. Having obtained this result, we

again must exploit the arbitrary nature of τ . Setting τ = x, and subsituting into Eqn. 86,

we obtain:

(Woodruﬀ, 1993).

u(x) = α0 + ǫB1e1(α0x) + O(ǫ2)

27 Woodruﬀ argues that these terms vanish because the arbitrariness of x can be used to choose x = τ

(89)

(90)

(91)

69

But this is identical to the original solution (Eqn. 83)! What have we accomplished?

This renormalized result is guaranteed to be a uniformly valid result, for ∀x. The renor-

malization procedure ensures that the logarithmic divergence in Eqn. 91 is required by the

solution, and is not an artifact of our approximations. Obtaining the same answer is a

consequence of solving Eqn. 88 iteratively. Had we been able to solve that equation exactly,

this disconcerting coincidence would have been avoided.

We obtain the ﬁnal solution to Eqn. 77a by applying the boundary conditions (Eqn.

78b) to Eqn. 91: α0 = 1, B1 = −1/(ǫe1(ǫ)). Lastly, we undo the initial change of variables

(r = x/ǫ), yielding the result given in Eqn. 92. As shown in Chen et al., this is a spectacular

approximate solution (Chen et al., 1996).

Furthermore,
−1/ ln (1/ǫ) − γ/ ln2 (1/ǫ). These logarithmic functions of ǫ are exactly those which are

required by asymptotic matching! These “unexpected” orders in ǫ make the solution of

this problem via asymptotic matching very diﬃcult. They must be deduced and introduced

order by order, so as to make matching possible. In the RG solution, they are seen to arise

naturally as a consequence of the term 1/e1(ǫ).

There are several other equivalent ways to structure this calculation. It is worthwhile to

examine these (and to demonstrate their equivalence), in order to streamline our approach

for the low Reynolds number problems.

The ﬁrst variation occurs in how we apply the RG condition. Rather than applying ∂τ

to Eqn. 86, we may also realize that the original constants of integration, A0 = Z1(τ )A0(τ ),

must be independent of τ . Hence the “alternative” RG equation:

∂A0
∂τ

=

∂(Z1(τ )A0(τ ))
∂τ

Substituting Z1 = 1 + ǫ (−B1e1(τ A0(τ )(1 +

0(τ ) ∼ O (ǫ1), Eqn. 93 simpliﬁes to Eqn. 89 (to within O (ǫ2)), and

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

′

these two methods of implementing the RG condition are equivalent.

70

In addition to this dichotomous implementation of the RG condition, there is yet another

way to structure the analysis from the outset: We set A0 = 1 in the zeroth order solution,

and rely on the robustness of the RG approach to variations in our perturbative solution.

With this u0(x) solution, there is no longer any freedom in our choice of u1(x) integration

constants — both are needed to meet boundary conditions.

In this approach, our na¨ıve

perturbative solution is:

In fact, only B0 needs

to be renormalized, as the B1 term multiplies the secular term and consequently cannot

absorb that divergence. This can be seen systematically by attempting to renormalize both

variables. With an appropriate choice of coeﬃcients, a1 = −B1(τ )e1(τ ) and b1 = 0, the ﬁnal

term in the last equation is eliminated. b1 = 0 demonstrates that B1 does not need to be

renormalized at O (ǫ1). The resulting equation is given in Eqn. 95.

u(x) = 1 + ǫ (B0(τ ) + B1(τ ) (e1(x) − e1(τ ))) + O

(95)

ǫ2

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

We did not actually need to determine a1 or b1 in order to write the above equation; it

could have been done by inspection. Determination of these quantities is useful for two rea-

sons. First, it helps us see which secular terms are being renormalized by which integration

constants. Secondly, it allows the second implementation of the RG condition which was

described above. This can sometimes simplify calculations.

Using the ﬁrst implementation (requiring ∂τ u(x) = 0), and using Eqn. 95, we obtain:

this, we solve for B0(τ ) = β1 + β2e1(τ ). Substituting this result into Eqn. 95, and setting

τ = x, we obtain the renormalized solution:

u(x) = 1 + ǫ (β1 + β2e1(x))

(97)

71

The boundary conditions in Eqn. 78b are satisﬁed if β1 = 0 and β2 = −1/(ǫe1(ǫ)). Returning

(98)

This is identical to Eqn. 92, demonstrating the equivalence of these calculations. The latter

method is preferable, as it avoids the nonlinear RG equation (Eqn. 89). We will use this

second approach for analyzing the low Reynolds number problems.

The RG analysis has shown us that the logarithmic divergences present in Eqn. 84 are

an essential component of the solution, Eqn. 98. However, we must work to O (ǫ2) in order

to see the true utility of RG and to understand all of the nuances of its application.

c. O (ǫ2) solution

We base our treatment of the O (ǫ2) on the second analysis presented above. Through

O (ǫ1), the na¨ıve solution is: u0(x) = 1, u1(x) = B0 + B1e1(x). Substituting into Eqn. 82,

we obtain the governing equation for u2(x):

As discussed previously, we are free to choose C0, C1 to simplify subsequent calculations.

The constants B0, B1 are able to meet the boundary conditions, so there is no need to retain
the O (ǫ2) constants: We choose C0 = 0, C1 = 0. In this case, the diﬀering diﬀering choices
of C0, C1 correspond to a redeﬁnition of B0, B1 plus a change of O (ǫ3), i.e. ˜B0 = B0 + ǫC0.28

The underlined terms in this expression are divergent as x → 0; the doubly underlined

28 This was not true at the previous order.

72

100. However, there is a great deal of ﬂexibility in its implementation; while most tactics

yield equivalent approximations, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in complexity. We now

explore all of the organizational possibilities in the terrible problem, an exercise which will

subsequently guide us through the low Reynolds number calculations.

The ﬁrst possibility is to treat only the most secular term at O (ǫ2). The doubly under-

lined term dominates the divergent behavior, and contains the most important information

needed for RG to construct a uniformly valid approximation. The approximation reached

by this approach is necessarily inferior to those obtained utilizing additional terms. However

it is nonetheless valid and useful, and eliminating most of the O (ǫ2) terms simpliﬁes our

6. Choose the integration constants in this result to satisfy Eqn. 78b.

(107)

This is identical to our starting point, Eqn. 100 (retaining only the most secular terms).

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

This should no longer be surprising, as we observed the same phenomena in the O (ǫ1) anal-

ysis (Eqn. 91). However, it is worth noticing that we obtained two diﬀerent results (Eqns.

104, 107) depending on how we structured our RG calculation. This apparent diﬃculty is

illusory, and the results are equivalent: Expanding Eqn. 103 for small ǫ reproduces Eqn.

107. Here, as in previous cases, we are free to structure the RG calculation for convenience.

This easiest calculation is the second approach — in which only one constant of integration

is actually renormalized — and our renormalized result is the same as our na¨ıve starting

point.

This simpliﬁed analysis (considering only the most secular terms) illustrates some of the

pitfalls which can arise in applying RG to switchback problems. However, we must ﬁnish

the O (ǫ2) analysis by considering all terms in Eqn. 100 to understand the ﬁnal nuances of

these problems. There is a new complication when we attempt to renormalize all terms of
1e−xe1(x), has the same kind of “splitting” ambiguity which

Eqn. 100: The ﬁnal term, −B2

we encountered in dealing with the doubly underlined term.

We introduce our arbitrary position variable, τ , which we want to choose so as to eliminate

the secular term in x by replacing it with a divergence in τ . In many cases, it is clear how

to deal with the secular term. For example, a linear divergence — x — can be replaced

with x − τ + τ . The ﬁnal τ will be absorbed into the renormalized constants of integration,

renormalization. However the term −B2

and the x − τ term (which is now considered non-secular), will ultimately disappear after
1e−xe1(x) is confusing. As seen above, there are two
1(x)/2 term. There are four diﬀerent ways to split e−xe1(x). It may

ways to “split” the B2

1e2

be replaced by any of the following:

1. (e−x − e−τ ) e1(x) + e−τ e1(x)

2. e−xe1(x) − e−τ e1(τ ) + e−τ e1(τ )

75

3. (e−x − e−τ ) (e1(x) − e1(τ )) + e−τ e1(x) + e−xe1(x) − e−τ e1(τ )

4. e−x (e1(x) − e1(τ )) + e−xe1(τ )

All four of these options “cure” the divergent term (i.e. the secular term will vanish when

we subsequently set τ = x), and are equal to e−xe1(x). If handled properly, any of these

options can lead to a valid renormalized solution. However, we will show that the fourth

and ﬁnal option is most natural, and results in the simplest algebra.

How do we choose? The ﬁrst consideration is subtle: The overall renormalized pertur-

bative result must satisfy the governing equation (Eqn. 80) independently for each order in

ǫ. How we renormalize the O (ǫ1) divergences (Eqn. 95) has implications for O (ǫ2) calcu-

lations. For example, in O (ǫ1) renormalization, there is an important diﬀerence between

the presence of an additional O (ǫ2) term: ǫ2e−xB2

Eqn. 95 and Eqn. 85. The former has the additional term −ǫB1(τ )e1(τ ). This term requires
1(τ )e1(τ ). Without this term the O (ǫ2)
renormalized solution will not satisfy Eqn. 82, and the renormalization procedure will yield

an incorrect solution. We were able to gloss over this before because we were considering

only the most secular term at O (ǫ2).

Inspecting the four possible splittings enumerated above, we see that only the last two

options provide the necessary ǫ2e−xB2

1(τ )e1(τ ) term, and can satisfy Eqn. 82 without con-

This is, of course, identical to our na¨ıve staring point, a happenstance we have seen several

times previously. It is worth noting that the renormalized solutions obtained using Eqns.

110 and 111 are asymptotically equivalent to Eqn. 114.

It may seem that we have needlessly digressed into the “terrible” problem. However, a

clear-cut “best” strategy has emerged from our detailed exploration. Furthermore, we have

identiﬁed — and resolved — a number of subtleties in the application of RG. Before applying

these lessons to the problem of low Reynolds number ﬂow past a cylinder, we summarize

our conclusions.

The “best” strategy is the one used to derive Eqn. 114, a result which is identical to our

na¨ıve solution (Eqn. 100). First, transform to the inner equation. Solve the O (ǫ0) equation

incompletely (obtaining just one constant of integration), which can then be set to satisfy

the boundary condition at ∞. This “trick” necessitates retention of integration constants

at O (ǫ1), but results in computational simpliﬁcations (a non-linear RG equation) which are

essential in dealing with the Navier-Stokes equations.

At O (ǫ2), the homogeneous solution are identical to those at O (ǫ1). Consequently, the

O (ǫ2) integration constants need not be retained, as we can meet the boundary conditions

with the O (ǫ1) constants. We just pick a convenient particular solution.

To apply RG to the terrible problem, we ﬁrst “split” the secular terms. There are

several ways to do this, even after requiring that the renormalized perturbation expansions

satisfy the governing equations at each order. We can again choose for simplicity, bearing in

mind that O (ǫ1) renormalization can impact O (ǫ2) calculations. It is easiest to apply the

RG condition to the renormalized perturbation expansion, rather than applying it to the

integration constants directly. In solving the resulting equation, we want solutions which

are valid ∀x. To solve the RG equation, care must be taken to satisfy several conditions

simultaneously, and it cannot be assumed that our renormalized constants have a derivative

of O (ǫ1).

Although there is quite a bit of ﬂexibility in implementing the RG technique, our results

78

are robust: Regardless of how we structure the calculation, our solutions agree to within

an accuracy limited by the original na¨ıve perturbative solution; they are asymptotically

equivalent. It is this robustness which makes RG a useful tool for the low Reynolds number

problems, where the complexity of the Navier-Stokes equations will constrain our choices.

B. Flow past a cylinder

1. Rescaling

To solve Eqn. 9 using RG techniques, we begin by transforming the problem to the Oseen

variables. As in the terrible problem, to ﬁnd a solution which is valid for all ~r, we need to

analyze Eqn. 9 using a dominant balance argument. As it stands, diﬀerent terms of Eqn.

9 will dominate in diﬀerent regimes.32 Looking for a rescaling of ψ and r which makes all

terms of the same magnitude (more precisely, of the same order in R), yields the rescaling

given in Eqn. 115 (Proudman and Pearson, 1957).

Transforming to these variables, Eqn. 9 becomes:

2. Na¨ıve perturbation analysis

The next step in obtaining the RG solution is to begin with the ansatz that the solution

can be obtained from a perturbation expansion (Eqn. 118).

The zeroth order part of Eqn. 120 is the same as Eqn. 116, and is equally hard to solve.

But RG does not need a complete solution; we just need a starting point. We will begin

with the the equation which describes a uniform stream. This is analogous to the constant

O (ǫ0) solution in the “terrible” problem.

A ﬁrst integral to the O (R0) equation can be obtained by noting that any solutions of

∇2

ρΨ0(ρ, θ) = 0 are also solutions of Eqn. 120. This is Laplace’s equation in cylindrical

coordinates, and has the usual solution (assuming the potential is single-valued):

We are only interested in solutions with the symmetry imposed by the uniform ﬂow (Eqn.

require that An = 0 for n > 1. For simplicity at higher orders, we set Cn = 0; this is not
required, but these terms will simply re-appear at O (R1). Finally set A1 = 1 to satisfy the

boundary condition at ∞ (Eqn. 117). As in the “terrible” problem, this is done for technical

convenience, but will not change our results. We are left with the potential describing the

uniform ﬂow:

This equation is formally identical to Oseen’s equation (Eqn. 37), albeit derived through a

diﬀerent argument. This is fortuitous, as its solutions are known (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950).

Unfortunately, when working with stream functions, the solution can only be expressed as

an inﬁnite sum involving combinations of modiﬁed Bessel functions, Kn, In.

The general solution can be obtained either by following Tomotika or by using variation

of parameters (Proudman and Pearson, 1957). It is comprised of two parts, the ﬁrst being

a solution of Laplace’s equation (as at O (R0)). The same considerations of symmetry and

boundary conditions limit our solution: In Eqn. 120, A0 = B0 = Cn = Dn = 0; An = 0, if

n > 1. Here, however, we retain the constants Bn, and do not ﬁx A1. This is analogous to

what was done with the homogeneous terms at O (ǫ1) in the “terrible” problem. The second

part of the general solution is analogous to a particular solution in the “terrible” problem,

and can be obtained from Tomotika’s solution (Eqn. 49). These two results are combined

in Eqn. 123, which will be the basis for our RG analysis.

We see explicitly that this equation is a linear operator (L) acting on Ψ1, and that the RHS

is zero. This is the homogeneous Oseen equation. It is only because of our judicious choice

of Ψ0 that we do not need to deal with the inhomogeneous counterpart, i.e. with a non-zero

RHS. However, the inhomogeneous Oseen equation governs Ψn at all higher orders. This

can be seen for O (R2) from Eqn. 120.

In general, the solutions to the inhomogeneous Oseen equation are found using the method

of variation of parameters. It is worth exploring these solutions, as they provide some insight

81

into the structure of Eqn. 49. We now solve Eqn. 124 for a particular kind of inhomogeneity,

one which can be written as a Fourier sine series.33 We want to solve:

It is useful to relate Eqn. 131 to Tomotika’s solution (Eqn. 49). There are four integration

constants for each angular harmonic. Two are obvious: An,Bn. The other two arise in the

ﬁrst integral (the vorticity solution), Eqn. 128. However, every vorticity integration constant

appears in each harmonic of Eqn. 131. For example, you cannot uniquely assign α1 and β1

to the sin θ harmonic of Eqn. 131. However, if one considers n terms from Eqn. 128 and n

terms from Eqn. 131, there will be 4n integration constants — four per retained harmonic

of Eqn. 131. In passing we note that matched asymptotics workers avoid this problem by

using the vorticity directly, and thereby simplify their treatment of boundary conditions.

This approach does not work in conjunction with RG.

It is mildly disconcerting to have four integration constants, as there are only three

boundary conditions for each harmonic (Eqn. 117). However, two of the constants — An

and αn — will be determined by the boundary conditions at inﬁnity. This claim is not

obvious, particularly since terms which are divergent prior to renormalization might not be

present after the renormalization procedure. We outline here an argument which can be

made rigorous. There are two kinds of divergences in Eqn. 131: Terms which are secular as

ρ → 0, and terms which diverge too quickly as ρ → ∞.35

After renormalization, we will try to need to meet the boundary conditions (Eqn. 117).

As in the case of the “terrible” problem, it will turn out that the simplest approach to

35 To be precise, terms which diverge faster than ρ as ρ → ∞ are problematic, and prevent satisfying the

boundary conditions (Eqn. 117).

83

renormalization yields a renormalized perturbation solution which is the same as the na¨ıve

series. Consider Eqn. 131. The terms which are secular as ρ → 0 will not preclude satisfying

the boundary conditions. Those which diverge too quickly as ρ → ∞, however, will conﬂict

with Eqn. 117.

These terms must be eliminated by a suitable choice of integration constants. It turns

out not to matter whether we do this before or after the renormalization procedure. For

simplicity, we will do it before renormalizing. First, the coeﬃcient of ρn must vanish for all

n > 1. This can happen, with an appropriate choice of An, if

lim
ρ→∞

I (n)

lim
ρ→∞

J (n)

(ρ) ∼ O (1)

For this requirement to be met, the coeﬃcient of In(ρ/2) in Eqn. 128 must vanish (e.g.,
αn = limρ→∞ J n

1 (ρ)). It is always possible to choose αn appropriately, because the following

condition is satisﬁed for all n:

In our problem this is true because Fn(ρ) is based on solutions to the lower order governing

equations. By construction, these are well-behaved as ρ → ∞. Therefore, for the inho-

mogeneous Oseen equation under consideration (Eqn. 126), we see that two of the four

integration constants — An, αn — are needed to satisfy the boundary conditions at inﬁnity.

More speciﬁcally, the immediate problem requires us to consider the homogeneous Oseen’s

equation (Eqn. 124), and Tomotika’s solution (Eqn. 49). For this problem, Fn(ρ) = 0, and

the coeﬃcient of In(ρ/2) in Eqn. 128 has no ρ dependence. So we simply choose αn such

that this coeﬃcient vanishes. Simplifying Eqn. 128, we then have the following solution for

the vorticity:

(135)

This result is fundamentally the same as Tomotika’s (Eqn. 49). However, his solution

is more useful, as he accomplished the integrals in Eqn. 134. What is the point of all

this work? Firstly, the approach based on the variation of parameters may be applied to

the inhomogeneous Oseen’s equation, which must be solved for orders higher than O (R1).

Secondly, we see explicitly what happens to the two sets of integration constants αn and An.
Tomotika’s solution has but two integration constants36 — Bn and βn. The other constants

have already been chosen so as to satisfy the boundary conditions at ∞. We have shown

explicitly how they must be determined, and stated without proof that this may be done

prior to renormalization. In short, we have explained why Eqn. 123 is the appropriately

general O (R1) solution for our na¨ıve perturbation analysis.

In addition to explaining why Tomotika’s solution is a suitable starting point for

RG, our analysis also connects with the O (R1) solution of Proudman and Pearson

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957). We have shown that the vorticity must be well-behaved

at ρ = ∞ if the overall solution is to satisfy the boundary conditions.

a. Secular behavior

Combining Eqns. 121, 123, we begin the following na¨ıve solution:

(cid:1)(136)
(cid:0)

Although intimidating, this is conceptually equivalent to Eqn. 85 (in the terrible problem).

The ﬁrst step in our analysis is identifying which terms are divergent. As explained above,

Eqn. 136 is speciﬁcally constructed to be of O (ρ1) as ρ → ∞. In fact, only the O (R0) and

A1 terms matter at large ρ. As ρ → 0, however, many other terms in Eqn. 136 diverge. All

of the Bn terms diverge. Most of the Φm,n(ρ) terms are also secular.

36 There is also A1, but this is a obviously a special case.

85

Rather than enumerating and sorting through the diﬀerent divergences, we simply treat

the problem abstractly. Eqn. 136 can be rewritten as:

Ψ(ρ, θ) = ρ sin(θ) + R (A1ρ sin θ + R(ρ, θ; {Bi}; {Xj}) + S(ρ, θ; {Bm}; {Xn}))

(137)

Here, S includes the terms which are secular as ρ → 0, and R includes regular terms.

5. Renormalization

Equation 137 is renormalized just like the terrible problem. We begin with the renormal-

ized perturbation expansion given in Eqn. 138. Note that we are not specifying the details

of which terms are secular, or how we are “splitting” these terms. The only term we are

explicitly considering is A1. This is a trick built on consideration of the terrible problem.

Our “best” solution (Eqn. 114) to that problem was built on the renormalization of just

one constant, B0 in Eqn. 113a. Essentially, we will repeat that procedure here, using A1 as

that constant.

Ψ(ρ, θ) = ρ sin(θ) + R

A1(τ )ρ sin θ + R(ρ, θ; {Bi(τ )}; {Xj(τ )}) +

(cid:16)

R2

(cid:0)

(cid:1) (cid:17)

We will now apply the RG condition — ∂τ Ψ(ρ, θ) = 0 — to this equation. Accomplishing

this in complete generality is diﬃcult. However, using our experience from the terrible

problem, we can see that this is not necessary. The RG condition may be satisﬁed as

follows: First, suppose that X

′

n(τ ) = O (R2)

′

∀n, B

m(τ ) = O (R2)

∀m. These equations

are satisﬁed by Xn(τ ) = χn, Bm(τ ) = βm. Substituting these results into Eqn. 138, and

applying the RG condition results in:

This is easily solved for A1(τ ).

(cid:17)

A1(τ ) =

S(τ, θ; {βm}; {χn})
ρ sin θ

+ α1

(139)

(140)

We have explicitly validated our supposition that {Xn(τ )} and {Bm(τ )} can be constants.

With this supposition, we have shown that the RG condition applied to Eqn. 138 can be

satisﬁed with an appropriate choice of A1(τ ). We have satisﬁed the RG condition through

86

clever tricks derived from our experience with the terrible problem. However, this solution

is entirely valid, and our experience with the terrible problem has shown us that more

complicated solutions are asymptotically equivalent.

Substituting Eqn. 140 into Eqn. 138, and setting τ = ρ, we obtain our renormalized

solution:

Ψ(ρ, θ) = ρ sin(θ) + R (α1ρ sin θ + R(ρ, θ; {βi}; {χj}) + S(ρ, θ; {βm}; {χn}))

(141)

By now it should not be surprising that this is the same equation as our naive pertur-

bation solution (Eqn. 137), and by extension the same solution obtained by Tomotika

(Tomotika and Aoi, 1950). As in the case of the terrible problem, however, we now know

that this is a uniformly valid approximation. We now may choose the integration constants

to satisfy the boundary conditions, and then calculate the drag coeﬃcient.

a. Truncation

Unfortunately, there are inﬁnitely many integration constants, and it is impossible to

apply the boundary conditions to our renormalized solution (or Eqn. 136). To progress

further, we must make the same sort of uncontrolled approximations made by previous

workers (Proudman and Pearson, 1957; Tomotika and Aoi, 1950).37

Our approximation consists of a careful truncation, in both m and n, of the series in Eqn.

136. There are two important points to consider. First is the sin θ symmetry of the overall

problem: terms proportional to sin θ reﬂect the symmetries exhibited by the uniform ﬂow

which are imposed on our solution via the boundary conditions at inﬁnity. The importance

of the this harmonic is further seen in Eqn. 21: Only the coeﬃcient of sin θ will be needed

for the computation of CD.

Secondly we recall that the remaining boundary conditions are imposed at the surface

of the sphere, at ρ = R in Oseen coordinates. When applying the boundary conditions,

terms which are secular as ρ → 0 will therefore be most important. Speciﬁcally, we cannot

truncate any terms which are divergent, although we are at liberty to set their coeﬃcients

equal to zero.

These considerations allow exactly one solution. First, set all Bn = 0 n > 1. Secondly,

37 Kaplun was able to avoid this diﬃculty by using the velocity ﬁeld instead of stream functions, although
his approach brings other problems: the solution cannot be expressed in closed form, and must be ap-
proximated to apply the boundary conditions (see section II.B.3).

set all Xm = 0 m > 0. We retain three coeﬃcients: A1, B1, X0, which will permit the

boundary conditions to be satisﬁed for the sin θ harmonic. What about the higher harmon-

ics? These terms are truncated in an uncontrolled approximation. However, as we will show,

the discarded terms are O (R3 log R) or higher at the surface of the sphere. They are regular

terms, and thus negligible in comparison to the secular terms retained (which are O (R−1)).

Now, suppose we follow Tomotika, and try to extend this approach, by retaining a few

more terms. The next step would be to retain the B2, X1 terms, and to try to satisfy the

boundary conditions for the sin 2θ harmonic. As before, all the higher Bn, Xm are set to

zero. Why not include the next harmonic or two?

The answer lies in the terms we discard. If we satisfy the boundary conditions at ρ = R

for the ﬁrst n harmonics, we must retain the coeﬃcients X0, ..., Xn − 1. To minimize the

amount of truncation we do, ﬁrst set Xm = 0 for ∀m > n − 1 and Bk = 0 for ∀k > n. What,

then, is the form of the terms which are discarded from our solution?

terms are negligible, as we are working to O (R1).38 When we retain higher harmonics,

everything changes. Table IV shows the magnitude of the discarded terms at ρ = R for the

ﬁrst four harmonics.

38 This argument is somewhat simplistic: The neglected terms also contribute, when meeting the boundary
conditions, to the values of the retained coeﬃcients. i.e. All non-zero Xm aﬀect X0. But these are lower
order eﬀects.

88

From Table IV, we see immediately that to retain sin 2θ harmonics, we must have an

error in our derivative boundary condition of O (R1) — the order to which we are trying

to work. If we retain higher harmonics, this situation gets worse. First we have an O (R1)

error in the stream function itself, and then we begin to have errors which are divergent in
R! For n > 4, both Ψ(n)

′(n)
discard(ρ, θ) are increasingly divergent functions of R.
Since it is in practice impossible to ﬁt the boundary conditions to Eqn. 136, we must

discard(ρ, θ) and Ψ

truncate the series expansion. We have shown that there is only one truncation consistent

with both the symmetry requirements of the problem and the demand that we satisfy the

boundary conditions to O (R1):

Ψ(ρ, θ) = ρ sin(θ) + R

(143)

This result is identical to Proudman’s O (R1) result for the Oseen stream function

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957). However, he arrives at this result by considering matching

requirements with the O (R0) Stokes expansion and by imposing sin θ symmetry on the ﬁrst

integral (Eqn. 130). Our approach arrives at the same conclusion, but without the need

for asymptotic matching or the two expansions it requires. Moreover, we did not need the

expertise and ﬁnesse which matched asymptotics workers needed to deduce the unusual form

of their expansions (e.g., the 1/ log R term in Eqn. 58). Finally, we note that Tomotika’s

numerical results support our truncation (Tomotika and Aoi, 1950).

b. Meeting boundary conditions

It is straightforward to apply the boundary conditions (Eqn. 10) to Eqn. 143. To satisfy

the condition at inﬁnity, A1 = 0. The other two requirements are met by the following

choice of coeﬃcients:

This result is plotted in Figure 14, where it is compared against the principal results of Oseen

theory, matched asymptotic theory, and experiments. When compared asymptotically, all

of these theoretical predictions agree. At small but not inﬁnitesimal Reynolds number, the

largest diﬀerence is seen between Kaplun’s second order result and the ﬁrst order predictions,

including Eqn. 147. As explained previously, current experimental data cannot determine

whether Kaplun’s second order matched asymptotics solution is actually superior.

The RG result lies among the ﬁrst order predictions. Fundamentally, the RG calculation

begins with an equation similar to Oseen’s, so this is not too surprising. Within this group

Eqn. 147 performs very well, and is only slightly bettered by Imai’s prediction (Eqn. 51).

These two results are very close over the range 0 < R < 1.

The real strength of Eqn. 147 can be seen in in Figure 15. As the Reynolds number

increases beyond R = 1, all other theories begin to behave pathologically. They diverge from

experimental measurements and behave non-physically (e.g., a negative drag coeﬃcient).

The RG prediction suﬀers from none of these problems; it is well behaved for all R. As it is

still based on a perturbative solution, it does becomes less accurate as R increases.

stream boundary condition (Eqn. 151) at ρ = ∞. We thereby obtain:

This result is also derived in matched asymptotic analysis, and is formally identical to the

of integration constants which multiply the two modiﬁed Bessel functions. We are beset by

the same considerations, which (properly speaking) must be resolved by applying boundary

conditions (Eqn. 151) to the renormalized solution. Following the same arguments given for

the cylinder, we set the coeﬃcients Bn = 0, which will later make it possible to satisfy the

boundary conditions at inﬁnity.

Completing the second integration is diﬃcult, but was accomplished by Goldstein

(Goldstein, 1929). The requisite solution is essentially the second term in Eqn. 46:

Note that we have omitted the terms AnrnQn(µ) which diverge too quickly at inﬁnity (this

Alternatively, one may simplify the series in Eqn. 157, by retaining only the n = 1 term

(setting all other An = 0). It is then possible to complete the second integration with a

As before, we neglect the AnrnQn(µ) solutions. This is essentially Oseen’s solution (Eqn.

38), expressed in the appropriate variables and with undetermined coeﬃcients.

We therefore have two solutions (Eqns. 158, 159) which can be used for Ψ1. For the

moment, we will consider both. We will later demonstrate that the former is the preferred

choice by considering boundary conditions.

5. Secular behavior

We consider our O (R1) na¨ıve solution abstractly:

Ψ(ρ, µ) = −ρ2Q1(µ) + R

A1ρ2Q1(µ) +

Bnρ−nQn(µ) + · · ·

+ O

(160)

 

∞

n=1
X

!

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

This generic form encompasses both Eqn. 159 and Eqn. 158.

It also possesses two key

similarities with both the terrible and the cylinder problems. First, there is a term at O (R1)

which is a multiple of the O (R0) solution (A1ρ2Q1(µ)). Secondly, the secular behavior in

our na¨ıve solution occurs at the same order as the integration constants which we hope to

renormalize.41 This fact is in essence related to equations like Eqn. 89, which must be solved

iteratively. We avoided that kind of RG equation by introducing the constant which could

have been associated with the O (R0) solution at O (R1). But renormalizing divergences

into integration constants at the same order limits the ability of RG to “re-sum” our na¨ıve

series. In all of these cases, the real power of RG techniques could be seen by extending our

analysis to O (R2).

Because of the similarities between Eqn. 160 and Eqn. 136, we can tackle this problem

in a manner formally the same as the cylinder. By construction, Eqn. 160 is O (ρ2) as

ρ → ∞. Hence the only terms with problematic secular behavior occurs in the limit ρ → 0.

As before, these divergences need not even be explicitly identiﬁed. We write:

Ψ(ρ, µ) = −ρ2Q1(µ) + R

A1ρ2Q1(µ) + R(ρ, µ; {Bi}; {Xj}) + S(ρ, µ; {Bm}; {Xn})

(161)

Here, S includes the terms which are secular as ρ → 0, and R includes regular terms.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

41 These secular terms are not written explicitly in Eqn. 160. They can be found in Eqns. 159 and 158.

95

6. Renormalization

renormalized solution:

Eqn. 161 is only cosmetically diﬀerent from Eqn. 137. Renormalizing the two equa-

tions can proceed in exactly the same fashion. Therefore, we may immediately write the

Ψ(ρ, µ) = −ρ2Q1(µ) + R

α1ρ2Q1(µ) + R(ρ, θ; {βi}; {χj}) + S(ρ, θ; {βm}; {χn})

(162)

This is, of course, the same solution from which we began. As in the previous two problems,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

we now know that it is a uniformly valid solution, and turn to the application of the boundary

conditions.

7. Meeting the boundary conditions

We have two possible solutions for Ψ1(ρ, µ). Considering the boundary conditions on

the surface of the sphere (Eqn. 151) will demonstrate why Eqn. 158 is preferential. Eqn.

159 can never satisfy the two requirements for all of the angular harmonics. Expanding the

exponential term, we see that although it has but one integration constant, it contributes to

all of the powers of µ. The second solution, Eqn. 158, can meet both of the boundary con-

ditions — in principle. However, as in the case of the cylinder, this is practically impossible,

and we must consider truncating our solution.

It is clear that we will need to approximate our solutions in order to apply the boundary

conditions. Our procedure is governed by the following considerations. First, we demand

that our approximate solution satisfy the boundary conditions as accurately as possible.

This requirement is necessary because our goal is to calculate the drag coeﬃcient, CD, a

calculation which is done by evaluating quantities derived from the stream function on the

surface of the sphere. Hence it is necessary that the stream function be as accurate as

possible in that regime. Secondly, we want the diﬀerence between our modiﬁed solution and

the exact solution (one which satisﬁes the governing equations) to be as small as possible.

a. Oseen’s solution

First, consider trying to satisfy these requirements starting from Eqn. 159. Although

this is the less general solution to Oseen’s equation, we consider Oseen’s solution because

of (1) its historical importance, including widespread use as a starting point for matched

asymptotics work and (2) the appealling simplicity of a closed-form solution.

96

We combine Eqns. 159 and 154 to begin from the solution: Ψ(ρ, µ) = Ψ0(ρ, µ) +

RΨ(b)

1 (ρ, µ). Since we are interested in the solution near the surface of the sphere (ρ = R),

and because there is no other way to determine the integration constants, we expand the

exponential in that vicinity. Retaining terms up to O (Rρ1) ∼ O (ρ2), we obtain:

(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:1)

The boundary conditions are satisﬁed if Bn = 0 ∀n > 1, A1 = 0, A1 = −3/2, and B1 =

−R2/2. In passing, we note that substituting these values into Eqn. 159 reproduces Oseen’s

original solution (Oseen, 1910). Continuing, we substitute these values into Eqn. 163,

obtaining:

3Rρ

This is nothing more than Stokes’ solution (Eqn. 28), albeit expressed in Oseen variables.

Ψ(ρ, µ) =

−ρ2 +

(cid:19)

Consequently, when substituted into Eqns. 11, 24, and 25 Eqn. 164 reproduces CD = 6π/R.

How accurate is our approximate solution? The diﬀerence between Eqn. 164 and Eqn.

159 is given by:

∆Ψ = −

R (1 + µ)

−2 + 2e−

2 ρ(1−µ) + ρ (1 − µ)

(165)

4

At the surface of the sphere (ρ = R), this equates to an O (R3) error in the stream function,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and an O (R2) error in the derivative. That is entirely acceptable. However, at large ρ, ∆Ψ

grows unbounded, being of O (ρ1). This is the fundamental problem with the solution given

by Eqn. 164. By beginning from Eqn. 158, we can avoid this diﬃculty.

It is at ﬁrst a little disconcerting that Oseen used his solution to obtain the next ap-

proximation to CD (Eqn. 39) (Oseen, 1913). How can our results be worse? As remarked

previously, Oseen got lucky making approximations in how he calculated the drag coeﬃ-

cient. As Proudman put it, “Strictly, Oseen’s method gives only the leading term ... and is

scarcely to be counted as superior to Stokes’ method for the purpose of obtaining the drag.”

(Proudman and Pearson, 1957)

b. Goldstein’s solution

We now apply the boundary conditions to Eqn. 158. By starting from the more general

solution to Oseen’s equation, we can remedy the diﬃculties encountered above. This analysis

will be very similar to the truncation performed on Tomotika’s solution for the cylinder

problem.

We combine Eqns. 158 and 154 to begin from the solution: Ψ(ρ, µ) = Ψ0(ρ, µ) +

RΨ(a)

1 (ρ, µ). As with the cylinder, we will approximate the full solution by truncating the

series in both m and n. Our ﬁrst consideration is again symmetry: The uniform ﬂow imposes

a sin θ, or Q1(µ) symmetry on the problem. Hence we must retain the n = 1 term in Eqn.

158. The importance of this term is clearly seen from Eqn. 26: Only the coeﬃcient of Q1(µ)

is needed to calculate the drag if the stream function satisﬁes the boundary conditions.

As in the case of the cylinder, if we retain n harmonics, we must retain m = n − 1

terms in the second sum (the sum over m) in order to meet both boundary conditions.

To minimize the error introduced by our approximations we set all other Bn, Xm equal to

zero. The remaining terms, those which would violate the boundary conditions and must

be truncated, are then given by Eqn. 166.

at the surface (the error in the boundary conditions). The error is given by Eqn. 166. First,
we calculate the magnitude of both Ψ(n)

discard(ρ, µ) and its derivative at the surface (ρ = R)

with n retained harmonics. The results are given in Table V.

From Table V, we see that to retain the Q2(µ) harmonics, we must have an error in our

derivative boundary condition of O (R1) — the order to which we are trying to work. If we

retain higher harmonics, this situation gets worse.

Since it is in practice impossible to ﬁt the boundary conditions to all harmonics, we must

truncate the series expansion. We see that there is only one truncation consistent with both

the symmetry requirements of the problem and the demand that we satisfy the boundary

conditions to O (R1):

discard(ρ, µ) get? Although, at
the surface of the sphere, Eqn. 167 is no better than Eqn. 164, it is superior for ρ 6= R. The

magnitude of the error is maximized as as ρ → ∞. It can be shown that Φm,n(x → ∞) ∼ x−2.

Therefore,

there is excellent agreement. At small but non-inﬁnitesimal Reynolds numbers, RG is nearly

identical to Oseen’s prediction (Eqn. 39), which is disappointing.

It is surprising that

Goldstein’s result is better than the RG result, as they are calculations of the same order in

R, and are a series approximation. That the matched asymptotics predictions are superior

is not surprising; Chester and Breach’s result began with a much higher order perturbative

approximation. If a higher order RG calculation were possible, RG ought to be better than

the same order matched asymptotics prediction.

As in the case of the cylinder, the real strength of Eqn. 172 can be seen as the Reynolds

number increases. Figure 17 demonstrates that all other theories diverge from experimental

measurements for R & 1. This is an unavoidable aspect of their structure and derivation —

they are only valid asymptotically. The RG prediction suﬀers from none of these problems.

Eqn. 172 is well behaved for all R, although it does become less accurate at larger Reynolds

numbers.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have devoted a substantial eﬀort to the historical problem of calculating the drag

coeﬃcient for ﬂow around a cylinder and a sphere at low Reynolds number. We report

four principal accomplishments. First, we have untangled over 150 years of diﬀuse, confus-

ing, and sometimes contradictory experimental, numerical, and theoretical results. We have

expressed all important previous work within a consistent mathematical framework, and

explained the approximations and assumptions which have gone into previous calculations.

Moreover, by plotting experimental results and theoretical predictions with the leading order

divergence removed (an idea originally due to Maxworthy), we have consistently and criti-

cally compared all available measurements. There are no other such exhaustive comparative

reviews available in the existing literature, which is piecemeal at best.

Secondly, we have extended traditional matched asymptotics calculations. We advance

101

and justify the idea that uniformly valid approximations, not the Stokes or Oseen expan-

sions42, should be used to calculate derivative quantities such as CD. By combining this

approach with previously published matched asymptotics results, we obtain new results for

the drag coeﬃcients. These results systematically improve on published drag coeﬃcients,

which relied only on the Stokes expansion. This methodology also resolved a problem in the

existing literature: the most accurate calculations for a cylinder, due to Skinner, had failed

to improve CD (Skinner, 1975). When treated via a uniformly valid approximation, our new

result based on Skinner’s solutions betters all matched asymptotics predictions.

We have also explored the structure and subtleties involved in applying renormalization

group techniques to the “terrible” problem posed by Hinch and Lagerstrom (Hinch, 1991;

Lagerstrom and Casten, 1972). This problem, previously solved by Chen et al. (Chen et al.,

1996), contains a rich and henceforth unexplored collection of hidden subtleties. We exhaus-

tively examined all possible complications which can arise while solving this problem with

the renormalization group. To treat some of these possibilities, we identiﬁed and imple-

mented a new constraint on the RG calculation; the renormalized perturbation solution

itself, not just the expansion on which it is based, must satisfy the governing equations to

the appropriate order in ǫ. While this had been done implicitly in previous calculations,

we had to deal with it explicitly (e.g., by appropriate choices of homogeneous solutions).

In the process of doing so, we obtained several new second order solutions to the “terrible”

problem, and demonstrated their equivalence.

The work with the “terrible” problem laid the foundation for our most signiﬁcant new

calculation. In close analogy with the “terrible” problem, we used the RG to derive new

results for the drag coeﬃcients for both a sphere and a cylinder (Eqns. 172 and 147,

respectively). These new results agree asymptotically with previous theoretical predictions,

but greatly surpass them at larger R. Other theories diverge pathologically, while the results

from the RG calculation remain well behaved.

We demonstrated that these new techniques could reproduce and improve upon the re-

sults of matched asymptotics — when applied to the very problem which that discipline was

created to solve! Matched asymptotics requires the use of two ingenious and intricate expan-

sions, replete with strange terms (like R log R) which must be introduced while solving the

42 “Inner” and “Outer” approximations in the usual matched asymptotics literature.

problem via a painful iterative process. RG requires only a single generic expansion, which

can always be written down a priori, even in complicated singular perturbation problems

with boundary layers. It therefore gives rise to a much more economical solution, requiring

half the work and yielding a superior result. It is hoped that demonstrating of the utility

of these techniques on this historical problem will result in increased interest and further

application of renormalization group techniques in ﬂuid mechanics.

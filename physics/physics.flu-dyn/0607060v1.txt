A NOTE ON THE REGULARITY OF INVISCID SHELL MODEL
OF TURBULENCE

PETER CONSTANTIN, BORIS LEVANT, AND EDRISS S. TITI

Abstract. In this paper we continue the analytical study of the sabra shell
model of energy turbulent cascade initiated in [11]. We prove the global exis-
tence of weak solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model, and show that these
solutions are unique for some short interval of time.
In addition, we prove
that the solutions conserve the energy, provided that the components of the
(√n log(n + 1))−1, for some positive absolute
solution satisfy
constant C, which is the analogue of the Onsager’s conjecture for the Euler’s
equations. Moreover, we give a Beal-Kato-Majda type criterion for the blow-
up of solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model and show the global regularity
of the solutions in the “two-dimensional” parameters regime.

1. Introduction

Shell models of turbulence have attracted interest as useful phenomenological
models that retain certain features of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Their
central computational advantage is the parameterization of the ﬂuctuation of a
λn+1 by very few repre-
turbulent ﬁeld in an octave of wave numbers λn <
sentative variables. This range of wave numbers is called a shell and the variables
retained are called shell variables. Like in the Fourier representation of Navier-
Stokes equations (NSE), the time evolution of the shell variables is governed by an
inﬁnite system of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations with quadratic nonlinear-
ities, with forcing applied to the large scales and viscous dissipation eﬀecting the
smaller ones. Because of the very reduced number of interactions in each octave
of wave numbers, the shell models are drastic modiﬁcation of the original NSE in
Fourier space.

The main objective of this work is to investigate the question of existence, unique-
ness and regularity of solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model of turbulence. This
model was introduced in [26] and its viscous version was studied analytically in [11].
It is worth noting that the results of this article apply equally well to the well-known
Gledzer-Okhitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model, introduced in [31]. For other shell
models see, e.g., [7], [18], [20], [31]. A recent review of the subject emphasizing the
applications of the shell models to the study of the energy-cascade mechanism in
turbulence can be found in [6].

The sabra shell model of turbulence describes the evolution of complex Fourier-
like components of a scalar velocity ﬁeld denoted by un. The associated one-
dimensional wavenumbers are denoted by kn, where the discrete index n is referred
to as the “shell index”. The equations of motion of the viscous sabra shell model

does not capture any geometry, we will consider L = k−1
as a ﬁxed typical length
scale of the model. In an analogy to the NSE ν > 0 represents a kinematic viscosity
and fn are the Fourier components of the forcing.

The choice of the non-linear term in the equation of the sabra model (1) which
contains only the local interaction between the shells, can be justiﬁed in the context
of the Kolmogorov theory of homogeneous turbulence (see [16], [20]). The theory
states that there is no interchange of energy between the modes of the velocity ﬁeld
with wavenumbers separated at least by “an order of magnitude”.

The three parameters of the model a, b and c are real. In order for the sabra
shell model to be a system of the hydrodynamic type we require that in the inviscid
(ν = 0) and unforced (fn = 0, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) case the model will have at least one
quadratic invariant. Requiring conservation of the energy

leads to the following relation between the parameters of the model, which we will

For the parameters satisfying a

Stokes turbulence. It was found (see [13]) that in that case the energy spectrum in

the traditional Kolmogorov scaling law k−5/3

The famous question of global well-posedness of the 3D Navier-Stokes and Euler
equations is a major open problem. In [11] we showed global regularity of weak
and strong solutions of (1) and smooth dependence on the initial data for the case
ν > 0. In this work we address the question of existence of regular solutions of the
inviscid (ν = 0) sabra shell model (1). First, we prove the global in time existence
of weak solutions with ﬁnite energy. Similar results for the inviscid GOY shell
model were obtained recently in ([2]). The existence of weak solutions for inviscid
hydrodynamic equations with only energy conservation is not known. The only
other analogue of the 3D Euler equations known to posses weak solutions of such
type is the inviscid surface quasi-geostrophic equation (see [9] and [33]). Next, we
show that every weak solution u(t)(u1(t), u2(t), . . . ) conserve the energy provided
that the components of the solution satisfy the decay estimate

(√n log(n + 1))−1,

for some positive absolute constant C, namely, provided it is regular enough. A
similar result for the solutions of Euler equations is known as the Onsager’s con-
jecture (see [32]) and it was proved in [10] (see also [14], [15]). We also give the
criteria for the weak solutions to remain unique in certain regularity class.

Next, we show that if the initial data is suﬃciently smooth, then the weak so-
lutions are smooth and unique for a short period of time. Similar results were
obtained in the context of other discrete models of Euler equations (see, e.g., [21],
[23], [24], [35]). The well known Beale-Kato-Majda theorem (see [5], [28]) gives a
criterion for the blow-up of the initially smooth solutions of the 3D Euler equa-
tions. In section 5 we establish a similar criterion for the inviscid sabra shell model
equations and use it to show the global regularity of the solutions of the model in
the 2D parameters regime. This picture is consistent with what is known about the
global regularity of solutions of the 2D Euler equations (see, e.g., [3], [4], [28], [29],
[36], and references therein).

Analytic and numerical study of loss of regularity of solutions of the inviscid
sabra shell model of turbulence, as well as the dissipation anomaly phenomena in
that model, is the subject of ongoing research ([12]).

2. Preliminaries and Functional Setting

We repeat here for the sake of self consistency the functional settings introduced
in section 2 of [11]. In particular, the Proposition 1 is a slightly more generalized
version of the Proposition 1 of [11].

Following the classical treatment of the NSE and Euler equations, and in order to
simplify the notation we are going to write the system (1) in the following functional

Let us consider the inviscid sabra shell model problem

+ B(u, u) = f

u(0) = uin.

One of the main properties of the sabra shell model of turbulence is the locality
of the non-linear interaction. This property allows us to prove the global existence
of weak solutions with the ﬁnite energy to the inviscid shell model in the following
sense. Similar results in the context of the GOY shell model with the stochastic
forcing were obtained recently in ([2]). In the rest of the section we give the suﬃcient
criteria for the weak solutions to conserve the energy, and investigate the question
of the uniqueness of weak solutions.

As we already mentioned in the introduction, our result for the sabra shell model
of turbulence is reminiscent of the Onsager’s conjecture for the Euler equations (see
[10], [14], [15], [32]). However, the criterion given by Theorem 2 is not sharp. It is
easy to give an example of a solution of the inviscid sabra shell model of turbulence,
which stays merely in H, but still conserves the energy. To see this, consider the
forcing f (f1, f2, . . . ), where

Then solution u(t) = (u1(t), u2(t), . . . ), where un(t) t
n , for n = 1, 3, 6, . . . , is a
weak solution of the sabra shell model, corresponding to the zero initial condition.
, however it is easy to see that
The function u(t) is only in H for every t <
it conserves the energy. Clearly, this example is pathological in a sense that all
non-linear interactions are absent due to the wide gaps between the excited modes,
however it shows that the result of Theorem 2 is not sharp. Moreover, it is not
known when the weak solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model dissipate energy.
These questions will be studied in the forthcoming work [12].

4. The short-time existence and uniqueness of strong solutions

The uniqueness of the weak solutions, whose existence was proved in Theorem 1
is not known. In this section we prove that the weak solutions of the inviscid case
sabra shell model are unique as long as they stay smooth enough, at least on the
short-time interval [0, T∗), where the time T∗ depends on the parameters of the
problem (a, b, c, k0 and λ), as well as the initial data uin and f . Let us consider the
inviscid sabra shell model problem (19) as an ordinary diﬀerential equation (ODE)
in the Hilbert space Vd, for d

short time existence and uniqueness of solutions of the equation (19).

Using the part (iii) of Theorem 4 we will be able in the section 5 to derive a
criterion for the blow-up of the solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model and to
prove the global (in time) existence of the unique, regular solutions in the particular
case of the 2-D regime of the inviscid sabra shell model.

5. A Beale-Kato-Majda type result

The Beale-Kato-Majda theorem (see [5], [28]) states, citing the original article,
“if a solution of the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations is initially smooth and loses
its regularity at some later time, then the maximum vorticity necessarily grows
without bound as the critical time approaches.” More precisely, if the initially
smooth solution of the Euler equations cannot be continued beyond the time T ∗,
and T ∗ is the ﬁrst such time, then

where ω = curlv is the vorticity and v is the velocity ﬁeld of the Euler equations.
Our goal in this section is to derive a similar criterion for the loss of regularity
of the solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model. Note that in our case, the analog
of the L∞ norm of the vorticity would be the ℓ∞ norm of the velocity “derivative”,
namely

Clearly, if this quantity becomes inﬁnite at some ﬁnite moment of time, then all
higher norms, namely
1, become unbounded at the same time. How-
ever, in the spirit of the Beale-Kato-Majda result for the Euler equations, we show
that the opposite is also true. In other words, we show that if a regular solution
u(t) of the inviscid shell model problem loses its regularity for the ﬁrst time at the
time T , then

Recall that for the range of parameters satisfying 0 < c/a < 1, corresponding to
the “two-dimensional” regime, the sabra shell model possesses two diﬀerent positive
quadratic invariants, one is associated with the energy and the second is associated
with the enstrophy in the analogy with the 2-D Euler equation (see [17])

The comprehensive numerical study of the shell model of turbulence in the 2-D
parameters regime was performed in [17] for the sabra model, and previously in
[13] for the GOY model. In particular, it showed that parameters setting deﬁned
by relation (43) corresponds to the enstrophy and energy equipartition across the
inertial range. Therefore, our rigorous result on existence of the solutions of the
inviscid shell model (37) globally in time supports these ﬁndings.

It was also found numerically, that for the parameters satisfying c

a > λ−2, the
shell models exhibit the direct enstrophy cascade in the inertial range and the
energy distribution becomes close to the Kraichnan’s dimensional prediction

(cid:10)
solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model, for parameters satisfying relation (44),
will blow-up in ﬁnite time, for some initial conditions, according to the criterion
proved in Theorem 5.

7. Cubic invariant and Hamiltonian structure

In practical numerical simulations of the sabra shell model one is limited to
consider a truncated model of N equations, setting un = 0, for n = N +1, N +2, . . . .
It was shown in [27] that such a ﬁnite system in the inviscid and unforced case
possesses a Hamiltonian structure for a speciﬁc value of the parameters. In this
section we will state, based on our results on the existence of the solutions of

A NOTE ON THE REGULARITY OF INVISCID SHELL MODEL OF TURBULENCE

the inviscid sabra shell model, that the inﬁnite system of equations also has a
Hamiltonian structure.

By rescaling the time and taking into the account the energy conservation as-

sumption (4), we will assume that

8. Conclusions

In this work we continued the analytic study of the shell models of turbulence,
initiated in [11]. We established the global existence of weak solutions and showed
that strong solutions remain regular and unique for some short period of time.
Moreover, we showed that the solutions for the “two-dimensional” range of param-
eters remain regular and unique globally in time.
In addition, we established a
Beale-Kato-Majda type criterion for the blow-up of the initially smooth solutions.
We showed that for some parameter regime the sabra shell model is an inﬁnite
dimensional Hamiltonian system. In contrast to the Euler equations, which possess
a quadratic Hamiltonian function (see, for example, [1], [30]), the Hamiltonian of
the inviscid sabra shell model is cubic.

We showed that the weak solution u(t) = (u1(t), u2(t), . . . ) conserve the energy

provided that the components of the solution satisfy

un| ≤
|

Ck−1/3
n

(√n log(n + 1))−1,

for some positive absolute constant C. A similar result for the Euler equations is
known as the Onsager’s conjecture (see [32]) and it was proved in [10] (see also [14],
[15]). The question of whether less regular solutions dissipate energy remains open.
The question of the possible loss of regularity and uniqueness for the initially
smooth solutions of the inviscid sabra shell model outside of the “two-dimensional”
range of parameters still remains open.

The dimensional argument for the viscous (ν > 0) GOY shell model, which
are also applicable to the sabra model, indicate that in the “three dimensional”
a < 0 the velocity ﬁeld scales like

we might expect the blow-up of the inviscid sabra (as well as GOY) shell model of
turbulence.

We would like to mention that the techniques, used to prove the blow-up for
other discrete models of Euler equations (see, e.g., [8], [21], [23], [24], [35]) could
not be applied directly in the case of the sabra shell model of turbulence. The study
of possible loss of regularity of the inviscid sabra shell model in diﬀerent parameters
regime is the subject of ongoing work ([12]).

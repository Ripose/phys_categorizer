Abstract

A dynamic procedure for the Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes-α (LANS-α) equations is devel-
oped where the variation in the parameter α in the direction of anisotropy is determined in a
self-consistent way from data contained in the simulation itself. In order to derive this model, the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are Helmholtz-ﬁltered at the grid and a test ﬁlter levels. A
Germano type identity is derived by comparing the ﬁltered subgrid scale stress terms with those
given in the LANS-α equations. Assuming constant α in homogenous directions of the ﬂow and
averaging in these directions, results in a nonlinear equation for the parameter α, which determines
the variation of α in the non-homogeneous directions or in time. Consequently, the parameter α
is calculated during the simulation instead of a pre-deﬁned value. The dynamic model is initially
tested in forced and decaying isotropic turbulent ﬂows where α is constant in space but it is al-
lowed to vary in time. It is observed that by using the dynamic LANS-α procedure a more accurate
simulation of the isotropic homogeneous turbulence is achieved. The energy spectra and the total
kinetic energy decay are captured more accurately as compared with the LANS-α simulations us-
ing a ﬁxed α. In order to evaluate the applicability of the dynamic LANS-α model in anisotropic
turbulence, a priori test of a turbulent channel ﬂow is performed. It is found that the parameter α
changes in the wall normal direction. Near a solid wall, the length scale α is seen to depend on the
distance from the wall with a vanishing value at the wall. On the other hand, away from the wall,
where the turbulence is more isotropic, α approaches an almost constant value. Furthermore, the
behavior of the subgrid scale stresses in the near wall region is captured accurately by the dynamic
LANS-α model. The dynamic LANS-α model has the potential to extend the applicability of the
LANS-α equations to more complicated anisotropic ﬂows.

Introduction

Turbulent ﬂows play a an important role in many areas of engineering ﬂuid mechanics as well as
atmospheric and oceanic ﬂows. Accurate simulation of a turbulent ﬂow requires that the energetics
of the large scale energy containing eddies, dissipative small scales, and inter-scale interactions to be
accounted for. In direct numerical simulations (DNS) all the involved scales are directly calculated.
DNS is believed to provide the most comprehensive representation of the governing equations of
ﬂuid ﬂows; the so-called Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Owing to the very high Reynolds numbers
encountered in most problems of interest, the disparity between the large scales and small scales,
which represents the computational size of the problem, rapidly grows with the Reynolds number.
Consequently, DNS can resolve only a small fraction of the turbulent activity for high Reynolds
number ﬂows.

While the direct numerical simulation of most engineering ﬂows seems unlikely in near future,
turbulence modeling could provide qualitative and in some cases quantitative measures for many
applications. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Equations
(RANS) are among the numerical techniques to reduce the computational intensity of turbulent
calculations. In LES, the dynamics of the large turbulence length scales are simulated accurately
and the small scales are modeled. The vast majority of contemporary LES make use of eddy-
viscosity based Subgrid-Scale (SGS) models in conjunction with the spatially-averaged (ﬁltered)
Navier-Stokes Equations. In this approach, the eﬀect of the unresolved turbulence is modeled as
an eﬀective increase in the molecular viscosity. On the other hand, RANS models are obtained by
time averaging the Navier-Stokes equations. In this case most of the unsteadiness is averaged out.
Consequently, the time mean quantities are calculated while the faster scale dynamics are modeled.
RANS simulations are often more aﬀordable than LES, however, their accuracy is somewhat limited
in many applications [24].

More recently, Holm, Marsden and their coworkers [12] introduced a Lagrangian averaging
technique for the mean motion of ideal incompressible ﬂows. Figure 1 contrasts the derivation
of LES, RANS, and the Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes-α (LANS-α) equations. Unlike the
traditional averaging or ﬁltering approach used for both RANS and LES, where the Navier-Stokes
equations are averaged or spatially ﬁltered, the Lagrangian averaging approach is based on averaging
at the level of the variational principle. In the isotropic Lagrangian Averaged Euler-α (LAE-α)
equations, ﬂuctuations smaller than a speciﬁed scale α are averaged at the level of the ﬂow maps
[3]. Mean ﬂuid dynamics are derived by applying an averaging procedure to the action principle of
the Euler equations. As shown in Figure 1, both the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations can be
derived in this manner (see Marsden & Ratiu [18] for a variational derivation of the Euler equations).
The usual Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or LES equations are then obtained through
the subsequent application of either a temporal or spatial average. The critical diﬀerence with the
Lagrangian averaging procedure is that the Lagrangian (kinetic energy minus potential energy) is
averaged prior to the application of Hamilton principle and a closure assumption is applied at this
stage. This procedure results in either the Lagrangian averaged Euler Equations (LAE-α)1 or the
Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes Equations (LANS-α), depending on whether or not a random
walk component is added in order to produce a true molecular diﬀusion term. Since the Hamilton
principle is applied after the Lagrangian averaging is performed, all the geometrical properties (e.g.
invariants) of the inviscid dynamics are retained even in the presence of the model terms which arise

In this nomenclature, α is used to denote the ﬁltering scale (i.e. the simulation faithfully represents motions on

a scale larger than α).

4from the closure assumption [12; 11; 10]. For instance, LAE equations posses a Kelvin circulation
theorem. Thus it is potentially possible to model the transfer of energy to the unresolved scales
without an incorrect attenuation of quantities such as resolved circulation. This is an important
distinction for many engineering and geophysical ﬂows where the accurate prediction of circulation
is highly desirable.

Numerical simulations by Chen et al [5] and Mohseni et al [22] showed the capability of the
LANS-α equations in simulating isotropic homogenous turbulence. However, most engineering and
geophysical ﬂows of interest are often anisotropic. For example, due to rapid damping of turbulent
ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of a wall, the application of the isotropic LANS-α equations with a
constant α is not appropriate for long term calculations. In order to capture the correct behavior
in such systems the parameter α must be spatially or/and temporally varied in the direction of
anisotropy [4], i.e. wall normal direction. There has been some attempt (with limited success) in
order to remedy this problem. A successful dynamic LANS-α model is yet to be formulated and
tested. There are at least two approaches to anisotropy in the LANS-α equations:

(i) To derive a set of anisotropic LANS-α equations. See alternative derivations in [10; 19].

(ii) Use the isotropic LANS-α equations, but with a variable α to compensate for the anisotropy.

At this point much more work must be done on the anisotropic LANS-α equations before they can
be applied to practical problems. The second approach listed above is what will be explored in this
study.

This paper is organized as follows: The isotropic LANS-α equations and some of their main
features are summarized in section 2. A dynamic LANS-α approach is proposed in section 3 where
the variation in the parameter α in the direction of anisotropy is determined in a self-consistent way
from the data contained in the simulation itself. Our approach will be developed in the same spirit as
the dynamic modeling procedure for conventional LES [8; 9; 20; 13] which has achieved widespread
use as very eﬀective means of estimating model parameters as a function of space and time as the
simulation progresses. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are Helmholtz-ﬁltered at the
grid and a test ﬁlter levels. A Germano type identity is derived by comparing the ﬁltered subgrid
scale stress terms with those given in the LANS-α equations. Considering a constant value of α and
averaging in the homogenous directions of the ﬂow results in a nonlinear equation for the parameter
α, which determines the variation of α in the non-homogeneous directions or time. This nonlinear
equation is solved by an iterative technique. Consequently, the parameter α is calculated during
the simulation instead of a ﬁxed and pre-deﬁned value.

Numerical techniques for simulating the dynamic LANS-α model in this study are described
in section 4. The performance of the dynamic LANS-α model in simulating forced and decaying

forced turbulence, the parameter α should remain constant in time and space. In decaying isotropic
turbulence, the parameter α could change in time as the integral scales of the turbulent ﬂow changes.
In order to demonstrate the applicability of the dynamic LANS-α model of this study in anisotropic
ﬂows, a priori test of turbulent channel ﬂows are also performed in section 5. Concluding results
are presented in section 6.

2 The Isotropic LANS-α Equations

The incompressible isotropic LANS-α equations for the large scale velocity u are given by (see [12]
for a derivation)

.

The subgrid scale stress τ (u) is in fact the momentum ﬂux of the large scales caused by the action
of smaller, unresolved scales. Here α is a constant length scale introduced during the averaging
process. Note that for vanishing parameter α the NS equations will be recovered.

The LANS-α equations can be represented equivalently by

The modiﬁed pressure P in these equations is determined, as usual, from the incompressibility
condition: ∇ · u = 0 and ∇ · v = 0.

One interpretation for the equations (1) is that they are obtained by averaging the Euler equa-

respect, one can show that the Lagrangian averaged Euler equations can be regarded as geodesic
equations for the H 1 metric on the volume preserving diﬀeomorphism group, as Arnold [2] did with
the L2 metric for the Euler equations. Note that in calculating the SGS stress τ (u) in equation
(3) one needs to calculate the inverse of the Helmholtz operator (1 − α2∆), which implies the need
to solve a Poisson equation. While eﬃcient numerical treatment of the Poisson equation, or its
possible elimination through rational approximation will be a focus of a future publication, we note,
in passing, that the inverse of the Helmholtz operator can be expanded in α to higher orders of the
Laplacian operator as shown in below

(1 − α2∆)

−1 = 1 + α2∆ + α4∆2 + · · · .

Consequently, solving a Poission equation for inverting the Helmholtz operator could be avoided.
It is interesting to note that the Lagrangian averaging technique preserves the Hamiltonian
structure of the governing equations in the inviscid limit while the eﬀects of small scales on the
macroscopic features of large scale are taken into account in a conservative manner. The Hamil-
tonian and Lagrangian formulations of ideal ﬂuids are both basic and useful. These formulations
are part of a more general framework of geometric mechanics, which plays a vital role in the de-
velopment of new continuum models suited for computation, as well as numerical algorithms that
preserve structure at the discrete level. In recent years the geometric approach to ﬂuid mechanics
has been quite successful. Geometrical methods provide a framework for the study of nonlinear
stability [1], variational integrators [14; 16], statistical equilibrium theory [6; 21], and many other
interesting topics in ﬂuid dynamics. The Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes-α uses ideas from
geometric mechanics and oﬀers a theoretically and computationally attractive approach to the
turbulence closure problem.

63 Derivation of a Dynamic LANS-α Model

The LANS-α equations for the large scale velocity u are given by equations (1), where τ (u) is
the subgrid stress tensor deﬁned in (3). This set of equations for α is similar to the grid ﬁltered
equation in the dynamic LES. In analogy with the dynamic LES one can obtain an equation for
the ﬁltering length scale, α, by ﬁltering the Navier-Stokes equations

with the Helmholtz related ﬁlters

The denominator in equation (16) could approach zero, where it creates a singularity. In dynamic

a similar least square approach a nonlinear equation for α could be found as

α2 = F (α) =

which does not have the singularity problem as in equation (16). This is a nonlinear equation for
α. All the quantities in equation (17) can be calculated during a LANS-α simulation. Therefore,
equation (17) provides a nonlinear equation for dynamically calculating the value of α during the
simulation.

At this point the potential values for the free parameter β are required. Writing the grid and

the grid ﬁlter scale α and the test ﬁlter scale ˜α on a schematic of the energy spectrum for a high
Reynolds number ﬂow. In order to accurately model the subgrid scale stress, both the grid ﬁlter
and the test ﬁlter scales must be located in the inertial sub-range of the energy spectrum. It should
be pointed out that the iterative calculation required in equation (17) does not require new ﬂow
ﬁeld calculations, and the iteration at each time step is carried out using the existing ﬂow ﬁeld at
the same time step. Similar to the dynamic LES model, the present dynamic LANS-α model has
a free parameter β, which is related to the characteristic length scale of the grid and test ﬁlters.

The dynamic α model given in equation (17) is designed to capture the length scale variations
in space and time. Aside from the isotropic homogenous turbulent ﬂows, it is well suited for
anisotropic ﬂows such as wall bounded turbulence or mixing ﬂow turbulence, where the turbulence
length scales could change in space or in time. In cases where there are directions of homogeneity,
such as the streamwise and spanwise direction in a channel ﬂow, one can average the parameter
α over the homogeneous directions. In a more general situation, we expect to replace the plane
average, used in the channel ﬂow, by an appropriate local spatial or time averaging scheme. For
isotropic homogenous turbulence, α is regarded as a constant in space and changes only in time.

4 Numerical Method

The dynamic procedure in this study is initially tested for forced and decaying isotropic turbulence
where the parameter α is constant over the computational domain, but can vary in time. Further-
more, a priori test of the dynamic LANS-α procedure in a turbulent channel ﬂow is investigated.
In this section the numerical technique for solving the governing equations are summarized.

Isotropic homogeneous turbulence. The computations are performed in a periodic cubic
box of side 2π. A standard parallel pesudospectral scheme with periodic boundary conditions
are employed. The spatial derivatives are calculated in the Fourier domain, while the nolinear
convective terms are computed in the physical space. A fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme is
implemented to advance the ﬂow ﬁeld in time. The two third rule is used in order to eliminate the
aliasing errors. Therefore, the upper one third of the wave modes are discarded at each stage of the
Runge-Kutta scheme. The initial velocity ﬁeld for each case was divergence free and constructed
to generate an energy spectrum of the form

E(k) ∼ k4exp[−2(k/kp)2].

The value of kp corresponds to the peak in the energy spectrum. The initial pressure ﬂuctuations
were obtained from the solution of a Possion equation.

Turbulent ﬂow in a channel. DNS data from del ´Alamo and J. Jim´enez [7] are employed for
the a priori test. The computational domain in this case, normalized based on the half channel
height, is spanned 8π in the streamwise and 4π in the spanwise directions. The spatial derivatives
are calculated by the pesudospectral method in streamwise and spanwise directions and by the
Chebychev-tau technique in the wall normal direction. Similar computational techniques have
successfully been used for the DNS of channel ﬂows by Kim et al [15] and Moser et al [23]. Grid
and test ﬁlters of Helmholtz types are applied in both streamwise and spanwise directions, while
no explicit ﬁlters are applied in the wall normal direction. α is assumed to be constant in the

9
homogenous directions, i.e. the streamwise and spanwise directions, in order to solve the nonlinear
equations (16) or (17). These equations are solved by an iterative technique. Since both the
mean ﬂow and the ﬂow perturbations vanish at the wall, singular behavior might occur in these
equations. This can be easily ﬁxed by starting the a priori test a few grid points away from the
wall. In actual simulation of the dynamic LANS-α equations, one can explicitly put α to zero below
in the immediate vicinity of a wall when the value of α drops below a threshold. The converged α
values at each point is used as an initial value for the iteration at the next grid layer.

5 Results and Discussions

Capabilities of the dynamic LANS-α model of the previous sections are examined in both isotropic
and anisotropic turbulent ﬂows. In isotropic homogeneous turbulence the parameter α is constant
in space but allowed to vary in time. Results of the dynamic model is compared with the isotropic
LANS-α simulations with a constant α and with the DNS data.

Decaying isotropic homogenous turbulence simulations. DNS of a decaying isotropic ho-
mogenous turbulence with initial Taylor Reynolds number of Reλ = 72 (corresponding to a com-
putational Reynolds number Re = 300) is performed to be used as a test case. The initial energy
spectrum is peaked at kp = 4. The isotropic LANS-α and the dynamic LANS-α simulations are
calculated for both 643 (corresponds to 483 after dealiasing) and 483 (corresponds to 323 after
dealiasing) resolutions, and direct numerical simulations are performed for 1283 (corresponds to
853 after dealiasing). The eddy turn over time for this case is found to be τ = 0.9. Figure 3 shows
the time evolution of α for β = 0.8, 0.9, 1, and 1.2. The values of α experience a sharp decrease
from its initial value during the ﬁrst eddy turn over time. However, it quickly settle down toward
a much slower varying value. Slight changes in α value after the ﬁrst eddy turn over time could be
traced back to ﬂattening of the energy spectrum as the turbulence decays.

10 The energy spectra at two diﬀerent times are shown in Figure 4, and the total kinetic energy
decay are shown in Figure 5. While a slight dependency on the value of β is observed, in general, the
energy spectrum at various times and the total kinetic energy decay are captured nicely. Mohseni
et al [22] demonstrated that in order to accurately simulate a turbulent ﬂow with the LANS-α
equations, the value of α should be somewhere, perhaps one decade lower than the peak of the
energy spectra toward the grid resolution. Careful considerations of Figures 3 and 4 reveal that the
dynamic LANS-α model of this study satisﬁes this criteria for all β values. In general, one expects
that the value of α to be in the inertial range of the energy spectra in order to correctly capture
the dynamics of the large scales. As illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, it is evident that the dynamic
LANS-α model provides a better estimate of the total kinetic energy decay and the energy spectra
over similar simulations with ﬁxed α calculations.

Forced isotropic homogenous turbulence simulations. Forced isotropic turbulence is one
of the most idealized and extensively simulated turbulent ﬂows. The numerical forcing of a tur-
bulent ﬂow is usually referred to the artiﬁcial addition of energy at the large scales in a numerical
simulation. Statistical equilibrium is signiﬁed by the balance between the input of kinetic energy
through the forcing and its output through the viscous dissipation. In this study, we adopted a
forcing method used in Chen et al [5] and Mosheni et al [22] where the wave modes in a spherical

the LANS-α equations with ﬁxed α is 643, while the DNS data is performed at a grid resolution of
1283 before dealiasing.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of α for β = 0.8 and 1.0. Similar to the decaying turbulence, a
sharp decrease in the value of α is observed over the ﬁrst eddy turn over time, where the values of
α settles down toward a constant value. This corresponds to an statistically equilibrated state. As
expected, the ﬁnal value of α is in the inertial range of the energy spectrum.

Figure 7 shows the energy spectrum at t = 5.8τ for β = 0.8 and 1.0. An inertial subrange
with ∼ k−5/3 energy spectrum is evident in the dynamic LANS-α simulations. The results of
the dynamic LANS-α simulations are compared with the DNS and the LANS-α simulations with
α = 0.2. The energy spectra of the dynamic LANS-α simulations for β = 0.8 and 1.0 show a better
agreement with the DNS data than the energy spectra for a LANS-α simulation with a constant α.

A priori test of a turbulent channel ﬂow. A priori test of the dynamic LANS-α model is
carried out in order to determine the accuracy of the model in predicting the SGS stresses and
the energy dissipation rates in a wall bounded ﬂow. The tests are performed on a DNS data of
del ´Alamo and Jim´enez [7] for a turbulent channel ﬂow. The turbulence Reynolds number, based
on the wall friction velocity, is Reτ = 550 and the computational grid is 1536 × 257 × 1536 in
the streamwise, wall normal, and spanwise directions, respectively. After dealiasing the physically
relevant part of the computational domain reduces to 1024 × 257 × 1023. The mean velocity proﬁle,
non-dimensionalized by the wall-shear velocity, is depicted in Figure 8(a), where a log layer from
y+ ≈ 80 to 220 is observed. Figure 8(b) shows the turbulence intensity proﬁles from the wall to the

middle of the channel in global coordinate which is normalized by half channel height δ. Maximum
turbulence intensities in all directions are located in the wall layer.

Figure 9 shows the variation of α with the distance from the wall in both global and wall
coordinates for β = 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2. As demonstrated in Figure 9(b), α values experience a sharp
increase in the vicinity of the wall up to y+ = 100. This region of sharp increase in the value of α
contains both the viscous sublayer and the buﬀer layer. Diminishing values of α is observed as one
approaches the wall. This is consistent with theoretical expectations that the NS equations ought
to be recovered in the laminar layer at the wall. The proﬁle of α in the vicinity of the wall shows
minimal dependency on β. Away from the wall and beyond y+ = 100, α shows little variation
across the channel. One can argue that the dynamic LANS-α equations in this case divides the
ﬂow into two distinct regions: a near wall region that includes both the viscous sublayer and the
buﬀer layer where α is a function of the distance from the wall, and a constant α region which
includes the log layer and the outer layer. In the near wall region α keeps an almost log relation
with the distance from the wall in wall units. In summary, one can argue that in wall bounded
ﬂows, the isotropic LANS-α calculations could be used with a constant α beyond y+ = 100 and
with a logarithmic relation in the near region. This projection requires further investigation in
LANS-α calculations.

Similar to the dynamic LES, one expects that the accuracy of the dynamic LANS-α model to
depend on its capability of accurately modeling the subgrid scale stresses. The modeled and the
exact SGS stresses in this ﬂow are shown in Figure 10 for the isotropic component < τ11 > and
Figure 11 for the shear stress component < τ12 >, where < · > stands for averaging in streamwise
and spanwise directions. The general trend of the SGS stresses are captured in the dynamic LANS-
α model without any ad hoc damping function. Good agreement between the modeled and the
exact SGS stresses in the near wall region are observed. The SGS stresses vanish at the wall and

dissipation < ε > are compared in Figure 12. Both the SGS stresses and the modeled dissipations
are eﬀectively insensitive to variation in β.

6 Conclusions

A dynamic LANS-α model is proposed where the variation in the parameter α in the direction
of anisotropy is determined in a self-consistent way from data contained in the simulation itself.
The model results in a nonlinear equation for α. Numerical experiments for decaying and forced
homogenous isotropic turbulence are performed using the dynamic LANS-α model. The simulation
results in both cases show an improvement over the LANS-α simulations with a ﬁxed α.

A priori test of the dynamic LANS-α model in a channel ﬂow is carried out, where good
agreement between the dynamic LANS-α predictions and the DNS data is observed. The parameter
α is found to rapidly change in the wall normal direction in the vicinity of the wall. Near the solid
wall, the length scale α shows a logarithmic dependence on the wall normal direction in wall units.
Away from the wall, and in the middle of the channel, α approaches an essentially constant value.
As a result, the turbulent ﬂow is divided into two regions: a constant α region away from the
wall and a near wall region. In the near wall region, α keeps an almost logarithmic relation with
the distance from the wall. Consequently, one can argue that in wall bounded ﬂows, the isotropic
LANS-α calculations could be used with a constant α beyond y+ = 100 and with a logarithmic
relation in the near region. These results indicates a promising application of the dynamic LANS-α
model in wall bounded turbulent ﬂow simulations.

Abstract

The interaction between large internal motion of DNA surrounded by
bio-ﬂuid is investigated. The phenomenon is modelled using the relativis-
tic Navier-Stokes lagrangian describing the bio-ﬂuid coupled to the standard
Klein-Gordon lagrangian describing the DNA. It is shown that the equation
of motion at non-relativistic limit, |~v| ≪ c, reproduces the well-known Sine-
Gordon equation. The eﬀect of the interaction in a single soliton solution is
also given and discussed.

From physical point of view, DNA is considered as a system consisting of many
interacting molecules in a particular conﬁguration of space-time. It has been shown
that under particular external conditions the molecules form a double helix [1]. The
helix has a dynamic and ﬂexible structure. The motion (transverse, longitudinal
and torsional) of DNA can be divided in two main regions : the small and large
amplitude of internal motions. The small amplitude of motion can be described by
the hamiltonian of harmonic oscillator. On the other hand, the large amplitude is
described by a non-harmonic one [2, 3].

Recently, many works have discussed and arrived at the conclusion that the
large amplitude of internal motion can be considered as a nonlinear dynamical sys-
tem where solitary conformational waves can be excited [1]. Nonlinear interaction
between molecules in DNA gives rise to a very stable excitation, the so-called soliton
[2]. Soliton is a pulse-like nonlinear wave which forms a collision with similar pulse
having static shape and speed [4].

As mentioned above, DNA is not motionless. It is in a constantly wringgling
dynamics state in a medium of bio-organic ﬂuid in the nucleus cell. However, the
motion of DNA surrounded by ﬂuid is rarely studied. Previous studies are usually
done by solving the Navier-Stokes equation and its wave equation simultaneously
using appropriate boundary conditions. On the other hand, in the Hamiltonian
formulation the viscous force is considered to be comparable with other forces arising
from Hamiltonian [5]. The solution is then obtained by expansion and performing
order-by-order calculation. In these approaches, anyway the picture of interaction
between DNA and its surrounding ﬂuid is not clear.

Now, in the present paper a new approach to investigate the interaction between
DNA and bio-ﬂuid is discussed using the lagrangian method. Rather putting it by
hand, the interaction is described in more natural way from the ﬁrst principle, i.e.
by introducing some symmetries in the lagrangian under consideration. This kind
of Navier-Stokes lagrangian has successfully been developed for both relativistic
and non-relativistics cases [6, 7, 8].
Imposing an appropriate (gauge) symmetry
to the bosonic lagrangian with boson ﬁeld Φ, one can construct a gauge invariant
lagrangian. The lagrangian induces gauge bosons Aµ as follows [8],

lNS = (∂µΦ)† (∂µΦ) + V (Φ) + lA ,

and satisﬁes the current conservation ∂µJ a

in lA are required to keep invariances of the bosonic lagrangian under local (non-
Abelian) gauge transformation U ≡ exp[−iT aθa(x)] [9], where Ta’s are generators
belong to a particular Lie group and satisfy certain commutation relation [T a, T b] =

While at non-relativistic limit, v ≪ c, it coincides to the classical Navier-Stokes

where m and λ are constants, and the dimensions are [m] = 1 and [λ] = 0 in the

equation. Using the Euler-lagrange principle, Eqs. (1), (4) and (5) yield the equation

One can further examine Eq. (7) in more detail. It might be interesting to see
the eﬀect of additional term due to the interaction with the ﬂuid represented by
non-zero U. Keeping U to be constant, i.e. no viscous eﬀect, is crucial to obtain an
analytic solution. Performing a standard mathematical procedure for the traveling
wave, i.e. Φ(x, t) = Φ(x − Ct) where C is phase velocity, the solution is,

The ﬁgure depicts the amplitude as a function of x − Ct. It is clear that the
amplitude of solitonic DNA will be damped by its interaction with surrounding
ﬂuid. In other word, the soliton with free medium (U0 = 0) propagates faster than
viscous medium. The result proves that one can explain the nonlinear wave equation
describing the large amplitude of DNA using the Navier-Stokes lagrangian from ﬁrst
principle without any ambiguities due to some phenomenological considerations as
done in conventional approaches. This approach is also easier than the conventional
ones as for instance the derivation of nonlinear wave equation through the Navier-
Stokes equation using perturbation theory.

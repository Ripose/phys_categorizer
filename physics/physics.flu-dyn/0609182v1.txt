In this paper, the eﬀects of interfacial tension between the sediment solid particle and liquid on
the settlement of sediment ﬂocs are investigated. After a discussion of mechanical and physical
chemistry, we give a settling velocity expression including such dynamical information of the ﬂoc
growth as interfacial tension and primary particle size etc.. The resulting expression indicates the
average settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs increases with increasing solid-liquid interfacial tension in
a form of power law and deceases with the primary particle size. We report on a general method for
analyzing settling behaviors of sediment ﬂocs under diﬀerent ﬂocculation conditions and verify the
rationality of the assumption of tension-induced ﬂocculation by ﬁtting typical experimental data to
the electrolyte concentration-dependent sedimentation model which can follow from the relationship
between interfacial tension and electrolyte concentration.

INTRODUCTION

The aggregation-sedimentation of

sediment ﬂocs,
which is widely involved by many areas of industry and
engineering such as mineral processing, irrigation works,
and hydraulic engineering, is a basic phenomenon in the
nature. Many fundamental researches have been devoted
to understanding of it [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Primary par-
ticles aggregate and form clusters or microﬂocs which
may continue to combine the remaining single particles
or other microﬂocs and thus become larger ﬂocs. When
the growth of ﬂocs is induced by the Brownian motion,
the diﬀusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) model
or the reaction limited cluster aggregation (RLCA) model
can well describe the process of this aggregation. How-
ever, when the ﬂocs become large enough to settle under
gravity, sedimentation alters the growth mechanism. If
the sediment concentration φ is low, the ﬂocs fall under
gravity, grow, fracturing and restructuring; the size of the
ﬂocs reach a ﬁnal value and the space-ﬁlling network con-
necting does not take place. Conversely, if φ is suﬃciently
large, the growing microﬂocs will form the space-ﬁlling
networks which spans all the cell very quickly.

The DLVO theory [7, 8], which attributes interactions
between colloidal suspensions to Van der Waals forces
and electrostatic repulsion, dynamically provides a quan-
titative description of many facts of ﬂocculation. In the
DLVO framework, colloidal suspensions tend to coagu-
late due to Van der Waals attractive forces, while elec-
trostatic repulsive forces promote stability of the sys-
tem, and the repulsive barrier may be decreased through
changing the physicochemical conditions, temperature,
ionic strength, PH, solvent quality and so on, which in-
duces the ﬂocculation of colloidal particles. Although the
DLVO theory can describe basic facts of ﬂocculation of

∗Electronic address: ydqc@eyou.com

colloids, it still can not completely elucidate the cause
of ﬂocculation phenomena. For example, the DLVO the-
ory encounter many diﬃculties in aggregation of charged
colloidal particles in aqueous media such as ﬂuid-crystal
coexistence phenomenon [9, 10, 11], and void formation
[12, 13], etc, where a long-ranged attraction is required.
In addition, the DLVO theory is also reluctant to explain
the transition from RLCA to DLCA [14], since the fact
that high electrolyte concentrations lead to a fractal di-
mension arising from DLCA model indicates that Van
der Waals force cannot act as such a role that may make
formation of the ﬂoc attributed only to pure Brownian
collisions which means the binding force between ﬂocs
should be independent of the ﬂoc itself.

To overcome discrepancies between theoretic predic-
tions and experimental observations, diﬀerent versions of
modiﬁcation to the DLVO theory, some of which have
additionally considered non-DLVO interactions resulting
from acid-base [15], steric [16], and hydrodynamic [17]
interfacial forces, have been presented. However, most
investigations into the eﬀects of the interface are con-
centrated on interactions between particles [18, 19, 20].
For a macroscopic system of sediment ﬂocs, whose sizes
can often reach 500∼1000 µm, eﬀects of interfacial ten-
sion between the solid particle and liquid on mechanical
balance of the ﬂoc are more necessary to be taken into
account, and on such a large scale the DLVO force be-
tween particles becomes negligibly small in comparison
with gravity and hydrodynamic forces acting on the ﬂoc,
so that dynamical reason for sediment ﬂocculation may
be attributed mainly to surface tension on the ﬂoc.

In this paper, we emphasize the eﬀects of the inter-
facial tension between solid particles and liquid on the
settlement of sediment ﬂocs. Few works about settling
dynamics of sediment ﬂocs are involved in the growth
mechanism of ﬂocs, and hence the aim of the paper is
to introduce such dynamical information as interfacial
tension, primary particle size (pps) etc.
in the settling
velocity expression of sediment ﬂocs. We present a gen-

eral method for investigating sedimentation of sediment
ﬂocs under diﬀerent ﬂocculation conditions and discuss
settling behaviors inﬂuenced by electrolyte concentration
in relation with typical experimental data.

II. THE SETTLING VELOCITY

We now consider a system of sediment particles of the
identical size in still water, and focus on such the situ-
ation that the sediment concentration φ is low so that
spatially networking does not happen. After a process of
aggregating, large ﬂocs fall under gravity, then average
settling velocity of the system is written as

U =

ψiv(Di),

Xi

(1)

where ψi denotes the weight of the i-th group of ﬂocs
with the same size Di , and v(Di) is (constant) settling
velocity of the ﬂoc belonging to the i-th group.
It is
necessarily emphasized that Di should be understood as
diameter of sphere of the same volume as the ﬂoc includ-
ing inside water. The isometric diameter is preferentially
considered here since some of experiments of measuring
settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs are based on weight
change determination that directly connects with the iso-
metric size.

Stokes settling velocity formula can be employed, if
the ﬂoc are not so large that eﬀects of turbulence on
it might be ignored, for expressing the size-dependent
sedimentation velocity v(Di) of the ﬂoc [21], namely

where ρAi,L represents the density of the i-th ﬂoc and

and ǫi denotes the porosity of the i-th ﬂoc. Here the
relation ρAi−ρL
= 1 − ǫi is used. Generally, Eq. (2) is
ρS −ρL
applicable for the case that the size of the settling ﬂoc
does not exceed 150 µm.

Investigations of ﬂoc structure [22, 23, 24] have shown
that the density (or porosity) of the ﬂoc may be evaluated
from the following relationship:

III. THE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE OF
SURFACE OF THE FLOC

Mechanism of growth of the ﬂoc aﬀects sedimentation
of it, hence we have to take into account eﬀects of the
mechanism of the growth on settling ﬂoc. It is pointed
out in this paper that the interfacial tension γ on the
solid-liquid interface (or the Gibbs dividing surface) be-
tween sediment solid particle and liquid plays a key role
in aggregation and sedimentation of particles or ﬂocs.
Obviously, the interfacial tension γ balances with the ad-
ditional pressure diﬀerence p between both sides of the
interface. The additional pressure diﬀerence p, which is
associated directly with stress which the ﬂoc is suﬀering,
is an important quantity determining the structure and
thus settlement of the ﬂoc. For a regular surface, p is in
inverse proportion to radius of curvature of the surface,
and then, for a ﬂoc surface with the fractal feature, what
properties does it have?

We assume, to expand the ﬂoc volume an increment
dV , the additional pressure needs to overcome the surface
work of the interface area adding dS , that is,

p =

γdS
dV

.

(8)

where dB denotes a modifying factor, Dc is the diameter
of collision, which denotes the size of the smallest sphere
that fully encompasses the ﬂoc, D0 is the diameter of the
primary particle comprising the ﬂoc, and α is a constant.
And the mass fractal dimension df can be scaled as df =
3 − α. The number N of primary particles within a ﬂoc
can be expressed in terms of the collision diameter Dc

and then from Eq. (5) we have

dS = πβsD2

0dN = (πβs/D0)d[(1−ǫ)D3]; dV =

πD2dD,
(9)
where βs is the proportion factor denoting the ratio of
solid surface contributing to external surface of the ﬂoc

1
2

to total solid surface, which is associated with the shape
of the ﬂoc. Combining Eq. (3), (8), and (9), we derive
the expression of the additional pressure diﬀerence,

p =

2γdf βsA2D
D3−df

2−df
0

.

(10)

It is clearly seen that the additional pressure of the ﬂoc
surface is inversely proportional to the size of the ﬂoc
since the fractal dimension df is generally less than 3,
and it decays following the power-law form, which is a
reﬂection of abnormal speciﬁc surface area of the ﬂoc, and
also the additional pressure may connect with electrolyte
concentration through γ according to Gibbs adsorption
law.

The reaction force of the additional pressure, acting on
the ﬂoc, provides a binding force that can stick particles
together. However, the inverse dependence on the ﬂoc
size of the binding force characterized by p implies that
not all positions on the surface of a certain ﬂoc can com-
bine the other speciﬁc ﬂoc due to the impact of external
forces such as gravity, shear force, etc. on the speciﬁc
ﬂoc. In other words, under the given mechanical condi-
tions, a ﬂoc would have a combinable region relative to
the other ﬂoc colliding with it, where both of them may
satisfy the mechanical condition of balance, as a result,
a ﬁrm agglomeration has to require many collisions of
the two ﬂocs, which indicates a sticking probability less
than 1 between ﬂocs. In particular, the sticking probabil-
ity varies as diﬀerent collision pairs since it is associated
with the ratio of the combinable region area to the total
surface area of either ﬂoc in a pair. Therefore, interfa-
cial tension-induced ﬂocculation dynamics may result in
a growth mechanism ruled by the relative sticking prob-
ability during settling.

It is worthwhile to note that the pressure p should be
understood as an average eﬀect resulting from diﬀerent
solid surfaces contributing to the external surface of the
ﬂoc, which can be seen from Eq. (8). In other words, for
diﬀerent solid surface elements on the external surface of
the ﬂoc, the pressure pi would be ﬂuctuating around the
average p deriving from Eq. (8).

IV. THE MAXIMAL SIZE OF THE FLOC

The interfacial tension-induced mechanism of ﬂoccula-
tion implies that there is a maximal diameter of the ﬂoc,
since size of the ﬂoc becoming large will abate the magni-
tude of the additional pressure of the surface, which char-
acterizes an ability of the ﬂoc’s capturing free particles
or ﬂocs. When sedimentation dominates over Brownian
motion, the ﬂoc sweeps up smaller ﬂocs underneath and
grows faster, and then, when can the ﬂoc’s size attain the
maximum?

Let us assume that the ﬂoc is a sphere, then during set-
tling, the upper hemisphere will receive few smaller ﬂocs
due to gravity, conversely the lower hemisphere can com-
bine large numbers of smaller ﬂocs. And we ﬁnd that the

3

pressure required to equilibrate a primary particle stuck
on the ﬂoc, which is exerted by the interface between the
external surface of the ﬂoc and the liquid, is minimum
when the primary particle is enveloped on the bottom of
the sphere (See Fig. 1). Assuming the actual additional
pressure, thus the actual pressure acting on the primary
particle, is averagely the same down the external surface
of the ﬂoc and is determined by the size of the ﬂoc, we
may know that the ﬂoc can not stick other ﬂocs together
any more if it is not able to adhere to the primary parti-
cle on its bottom. In other words, for the ﬂoc of certain
a size, the nearer the particle or ﬂoc approaches the bot-
tom of the main ﬂoc, the easier it is ﬁxed, hence shape
of the ﬁnal ﬂoc generally is of cobble or strip. The case
of the minimum pressure, corresponding to that of the
largest ﬂoc, is exactly what we focus on.

If enough particles are supplied to make the ﬂoc
largest, then for a primary particle attached critically
to the bottom of the ﬂoc, mechanical equilibrium gives:

p′ = −p, G = p′∆s,

(11)

where p′ is the pressure acting on the primary particle
from the interface, G is net weight of the primary particle
in water. Therefore the maximal diameter Dm of the ﬂoc
can be derived from Eq. (10) and Eq. (11):

Dm = (

πdf βsA2γ
cB∆ρg

1

)

3−df D

1−df
3−df
0

.

(12)

0 = cB∆ρgD3

Here we apply G = cB(ρS − ρL)gD3
0, where
cB is the shape factor, and ∆s = 1
0. It is clearly seen
that the maximal size Dm of the ﬂoc increases in a form
of power law as the interfacial tension γ grows, while it
drops with the size D0 of the primary particle since the
fractal dimension df is generally greater than 1 and less
than 3.

2 πD2

The expression of the maximal size Eq. (12) is a dy-
namical result which excludes some geometrical factors
such as competition between the ﬂocs in particles and
spatial distribution of particles or ﬂocs. In other words,
only if such dynamical parameters as γ, D0 etc. can sat-
isfy the critical condition of balance, the maximal size
of the ﬂoc may be uniquely determined. However, ac-
tual average size of ﬂocs in the system can not attain
the maximal size because of clustering competition, spa-
tial distribution, and suﬃciency of particles. Therefore,
the maximal size Dm is an imaginary quantity dependent
only on dynamical factors.

V. THE TENSION-DEPENDENT SETTLING
VELOCITY

In order to examine the eﬀect of the interfacial tension
on settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs, according to Eq.
(1) and Eq. (7), we write:

ing sediment system, since the pps indicates the essential
factors aﬀecting ﬂocculation such as density of sediment
ﬂoc and binding force inducing ﬂocculation etc., while
electrolyte concentration is only a reﬂection of inﬂuences
of solid adsorption action on ﬂocculation. However, ﬂoc-
culation factor expression Eq. (15) shows that F varies
inversely as ∆ρ and g. It is not surprising since smaller
∆ρg will lead to larger average size of ﬂocs when bind-
ing force is ﬁxed, yet this still needs further experimental
proof.

VI. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL
DATA

A. The salinity-dependent settling velocity

The eﬀect of electrolyte concentrations on the settling
behaviors of sediment ﬂocs may be derived from the rela-
tionship between the surface tension and electrolyte con-
centration C. The relationship between γ and C is ex-
hibited in the Gibbs adsorption equation:

Γ2,1 = −

C2
RT

dγ
dC2

,

(16)

where Γ2,1 is surface excess on the Gibbs’ dividing sur-
face, C2 is solute equilibrium concentration, R is mole gas
constant and T temperature. Therefore, if the isother-
mal adsorption property Γ2,1(C2) of the interface is given,
then the relationship between γ and C2 may be obtained
through integrating Eq.
(16). The solid-liquid inter-
face possesses more complex adsorption properties and
accordingly experimental investigations on the relation-
ship between Γ and C could be more reliable to study
the salinity-dependent settling behavior of sediment ﬂocs.
Nevertheless, many physicochemical experiments of sed-
iment and soil show that the adsorption curve of some
solid-liquid interfaces can be expressed by Langmuir ad-
sorption isotherm, namely

Γ2,1 = b

kC2
1 + kC2

,

(17)

where b is the saturation adsorptive capacity, and k is
adsorption constant.

However, for the interface between solid and liquid, we
are more interested in surface force relative to the solid
rather than relative to the bulk liquid. It is known that
the addition of salt to water will result in larger gas-liquid
surface tension. This is because attraction of the salt ion
in the bulk liquid for water molecules can draw more
water molecules inside the bulk liquid so that more work
would be needed to add a surface area, which shows that
the adsorption quantity of the dividing surface relative
In the same light, the
to the bulk liquid is negative.
adsorption of the solid to inorganic ions will also give rise
to a negative adsorption quantity of the dividing surface
relative to the bulk part between the dividing surface and

We actually provide a general method for investigating
settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs, since the dimensionless
number λ may remove the eﬀect of the dynamical factors
such as the interfacial tension and the primary particle
size, and is associated only with geometrical factors like
sediment concentration and spatial distribution of par-
ticles, provided the growth of the average size hDdf −1i
indeed dynamically results from those reasons which lead
to the the maximal size of the ﬂoc. In other words, the
reason why the average size of ﬂocs cannot reach the max-
imal could be that multi-body competition in particles
under certain conditions reduces chances of the growth
of each ﬂoc, which exactly arises from geometrical fac-
tors.

Then the average velocity of sediment ﬂocs can be ex-
pressed through replacing Dm in Eq. (13) with Eq. (12)
as follows:

We thus derive a setting velocity expression of sediment
ﬂocs including dynamical information, which shows that
the average settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs increases as
solid-liquid interfacial tension becomes large in a form of
power law, and has the decreasing relation with the pri-
mary particle size, since Vladimir Nikora et al. [26] have
proved that the fractal dimension df can aﬀect relation-
ship between velocity and size of the ﬂoc only when it is
greater than 2. In addition, because of high electrolyte
concentrations resulting in larger surface tensions, which
is correct for inorganic salt solutes from the knowledge
of physical chemistry, setting velocity would also increase
with the electrolyte concentration. We may also obtain
the expression of ﬂocculation factor F :

F = λ(

which is deﬁned as F = U/U0, where U0 denotes the
classical Stokes relationship for solid spherical particles,
namely U0 = 1

tration but the size D0 of the primary particle compris-

solid surface. Although the magnitude of the adsorption
relative respectively to two diﬀerent bulk parts, the bulk
part between the dividing surface and solid surface, and
the bulk liquid, is the same (the dividing surfaces in the
two cases are diﬀerent), the two quantities have opposite
sign with each other, and this distinction will play a key
role in determining properties of the interface tension.

Thus, combing Eq. (16) with Eq. (17) and noticing

sign of the adsorption quantity Γ2,1, we get

dγ =

bkRT
1 + kC2

dC2.

After the integration of Eq. (18), a tension-concentration
relationship can be obtained:

γ = bRT ln(1 + kC2) + γ0.

(19)

Here γ0 denotes the interface tension between solid and
pure solvent. Finally, the salinity-dependent settling ve-
locity U and ﬂocculation factor F can be expressed as

It is apparent that both settling velocity
of sediment ﬂocs and ﬂocculation factor increase with
increasing electrolyte concentration. However, real ad-
sorption of solid in the solution is quite complex, even
transitions between positive and negative adsorption of-
ten occurs for some cases. Therefore it would be more re-
liable that experimental methods determine the relation-
ship between γ and C to predict the eﬀects of electrolyte
concentration on settling velocity of sediment ﬂocs. The
γ-C form of Eq. (19) only reﬂects a simple case. In ad-
dition, average size of ﬂocs dependent on the maximal
size Dm can not be smaller than the pps D0, hence the
ﬂocculation factor F is always greater than or equal to
1, which indicates a cutoﬀ concentration Cc which guar-
antees hDi = λDm ≥ D0. The cutoﬀ concentration Cc
actually is the minimum salt concentration causing ﬂoc-
culation of particles of the D0 size in the present γ-C
form. If γ is a decreasing function of C, then Cc which
satisﬁes F = 1 should represent a minimum salt concen-
tration giving rise to maximal dispersion of ﬂocs.

In order to examine the rationality of the assumption

tation experiments of the coastal silt at the Bohai Bay
in China by Wu Deyi to the electrolyte concentration-
dependent sedimentation model Eq. (21) [27, 28]. Wu
Deyi et al. utilize the sedimentation balance to measure
the electrolyte (N a+) concentration-dependent settling
velocity in still water of silt ﬂocs after analyzing the par-

ticle size of salt-free silt sample by means of particle size
analyzer. The salt-free silt sample can be gained through
washing silt with distilled water and stirring and dispers-
ing them in distilled water. They report an empirical
formula between settling velocity and the salinity as well
as the pps as follows,

and take R = 8.31 × 107(dyne·cm·mol−1K−1), T =
293(K), γ0 = 72.92(dyne·cm−1), ∆ρ = 1.5(g·cm−3), and
g = 1000(cm·s−2). Here the unit of k is [L/mol] and B is
a dimensionless parameter. We use the least-squares ﬁt
of the model Eq. (23) to experimental data reﬂecting the
relationship between F and S to estimate values of the
parameters B, b, and k. The results are shown in Fig. 2
and Table. I.

It can be seen from the results of ﬁt that the ﬂoc-
culation factors obtained from the model Eq. (23) are
close to those from real experiments. Therefore the as-
sumption of the tension-induced ﬂocculation of sediment
particles are reasonable. The more experimental data
would attain better ﬁts, nevertheless, percentage diﬀer-
ence between F s obtained by ﬁts and experiments may
still provide a veriﬁcation of the rationality of the model
proposed. In particular, the magnitude of the ﬁtted pa-

rameter k which possesses deﬁnite physical sense accords
with our understanding of the adsorption of metal ions
on sediment particles which is generated from large num-
bers of experiments, for example, Ref [29, 30, 31, 32, 33],
In addition, the fact that values of the ﬁtted pa-
etc.
rameter b in diﬀerent measures are approximately equal
indicates that the parameter b may indeed represent such
a physical quantity as saturation adsorptive capacity.

VII. CONCLUSION

This paper proposes a theoretic model which attributes
dynamical reason of ﬂocculation of ﬂocs to the interfacial
tension between solid particles and liquid, and provides
a general method of analyzing sedimentation of sediment
ﬂocs. The resulting expression of settling velocity of sedi-
ment ﬂocs can give a good description of the relationship
between ﬂocculation factor and the electrolyte concentra-
tion without loss of physical sense of ﬁtted parameters.
In fact, actual interaction is so complex that more me-
chanical factors need to consider. For example, during
aggregation ruled by Brownian motion while interacting
ﬂocs being eﬀectively small, other forces have to be intro-
duced into balance conditions. Further study should be
aimed at direct conﬁrmation of the present model with
real experiments.

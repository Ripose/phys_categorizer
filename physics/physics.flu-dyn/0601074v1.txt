Abstract

We deﬁne center manifold as usual as an invariant manifold, tangent
to the invariant subspace of the linearization of the mapping deﬁning a
continuous dynamical system, but the center subspace that we consider
is associated with eigenvalues with small but not necessarily zero real
parts. We prove existence and smoothness of such center manifold as-
suming that certain inequalities between the center eigenvalues and the
rest of the spectrum hold. The theorem is valid for ﬁnite-dimensional
systems, as well as for inﬁnite-dimensional systems provided they sat-
isfy an additional condition. We show that the condition holds for the
Navier-Stokes equation subject to appropriate boundary conditions.

Introduction

Investigation of bifurcations in complex dynamical systems, e.g., hydrody-
namic or magnetohydrodynamic ones, can be simpliﬁed by reducing dimen-
sion of the state space. This can be done by the center manifold (CM) [8]
or Lyapunov-Schmidt [6] reductions. CM is an invariant manifold, tangent
to an invariant subspace of the linearization of the mapping deﬁning the con-
tinuous dynamical system. We will refer to the eigenvalues associated with
the invariant subspace as center eigenvalues.
In conventional deﬁnitions of
CM employed in applications (e.g., [1, 3, 14]) imaginary center eigenvalues
were assumed [4, 8, 16, 17]. Here we consider expanded CM, allowing center
eigenvalues with small but not necessarily zero real parts.

Our interest in such CM stems from the works [12, 13], where they were
applied for investigation of bifurcations in an ABC forced hydrodynamic sys-
tem. While the 6-dimensional reduced system, obtained by the conventional
CM reduction, reproduced only the ﬁrst bifurcation of the trivial steady state
[2], the 8-dimensional reduced system constructed with the use of an expanded
CM reproduced well the complex sequence of bifurcations of the original hy-
drodynamic system [12, 13].

To the best of our knowledge, the variants of deﬁnitions of CM, where
center eigenvalues with real parts unequal to one2 were allowed, were intro-
duced before only for discrete ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical systems [5, 15].
Nontrivial problems in the theory of CM are the questions of their existence
and smoothness. Theorems, guaranteeing existence and smoothness of CM for
the discrete ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical systems, where real parts of center
eigenvalues are close to one, are available [5, 15], but they cannot be gener-
alized by the standard technique [9] or other simple arguments to cover the
continuous inﬁnite-dimensional case.

Our goal is to present a strict mathematical proof of the expanded CM (for
the sake of simplicity, we will henceforth refer to them without the qualiﬁer
“expanded”) theorem, which is applicable for hydrodynamic system. First, the
theorem is proved for ﬁnite-dimensional systems. Second, we introduce a class
of inﬁnite-dimensional systems, for which the theorem remains valid. Finally,
we show that the Navier-Stokes equation belongs to this class, if it is considered
for appropriate boundary conditions and provided certain inequalities hold for
eigenvalues of the linearization of the equation near the trivial steady state.

The theory which we develop here involves modiﬁcations of the proof of
the CM theorem for ﬁnite-dimensional systems [16] (pp. 91-123), and of gen-
eralization of this theorem for inﬁnite-dimensional systems [17] (pp. 126-160).
We use a similar notation and follow the presentation of the papers. If a the-
orem or a lemma proved in these papers is applied here in its original form,
we present only its statement. Our presentation is otherwise complete.

2If a continuous system is transformed into a discrete one by time discretization [9],
eigenvalues of linearization increase by 1, and thus in discrete dynamical systems center
eigenvalues have real parts close to 1.

1. The center manifold theorem for center eigenvalues
with non-vanishing real parts. Finite-dimensional sys-
tems

1.1. The global CM theorem

We consider diﬀerential equations of the form

˙x = f (x) ≡ Ax + ˜f(x),

(1)

where x ∈ Rn, f : Rn → Rn is a C k vector ﬁeld, k ≥ 1, f (0) = 0, A =
Df (0) ∈ L(Rn) and hence ˜f (0) = 0, D ˜f(0) = 0. For each x ∈ Rn we denote
by t → ˜x(t, x) the unique solution to (1), satisfying x(0) = x; the maximal
interval of its existence is denoted by J(x). For an open Ω ⊂ Rn and x ∈ Ω
denote by JΩ(x) the maximal interval of t such that ˜x(·, x) ∈ Ω.

Let the spectrum of the operator A, σ(A) ⊂ C, be decomposed as a disjoint
union of the stable spectrum σs, the center spectrum σc and the unstable
spectrum σu, where

σs = {λ ∈ σ | Reλ < −Λ−},
σc = {λ ∈ σ | −Λ− ≤ Reλ ≤ Λ+},
σu = {λ ∈ σ | Reλ > Λ+}
and Λ± ≥ 0. Denote by Xs, Xc and Xu (the stable, the center and the unstable
subspaces) the subspaces of Rn spanned by the generalized eigenvectors of A
associated with the respective sets of eigenvalues; thus Rn = Xs ⊕ Xc ⊕ Xu.
We call Xh = Xs ⊕ Xu the hyperbolic subspace. Denote by π projections onto
corresponding subspaces:

(2)

πs : Rn → Xs,

πc : Rn → Xc,

πu : Rn → Xu

and πh = πs + πu.

Denote

β+ = min{Reλ | λ ∈ σu}
α+ = max{Reλ | λ ∈ σc}
α− = − min{Reλ | λ ∈ σc}
β− = − max{Reλ | λ ∈ σs}

(β+ = +∞ if σu = ∅, and β− = +∞ if σs = ∅). From (2), β+ > α+ ≥ 0 and
β− > α− ≥ 0.

Lemma 1. For any ǫ > 0 there exists a constant M(ǫ) such that the

following inequalities hold:

(3)

(4)

keAtπck ≤ M(ǫ)e(α++ǫ)t,
keAtπck ≤ M(ǫ)e−(α−+ǫ)t,
keAtπuk ≤ M(ǫ)e(β+−ǫ)t,
keAtπsk ≤ M(ǫ)e−(β−−ǫ)t,

∀t ≥ 0,
∀t ≤ 0,
∀t ≤ 0,
∀t ≥ 0.

The proof is identical to the proof of Lemma 1.1 in [16] and it is omitted here.

Denote by C k

b (X; Y ) the set of all bounded mappings from a Banach space

X to a Banach space Y with the norm

b (X; X) is denoted by C k

b (X).

Consider a system

(5)
where x ∈ Rn, A ∈ L(Rn) and g ∈ C k
b (Rn) for some k ≥ 1. Denote by ˜xg(t, x)
the solution to (5), satisfying x(0) = x. Since g is bounded, it is deﬁned for
all t.

˙x = Ax + g(x),

Theorem 1. There exists δ0 > 0 (depending on A ∈ L(Rn) ) such that for

each g ∈ C 1

b (Rn) with |g|1 < δ0 the following holds:

(i) Existence and invariance: the set

Mc = {x ∈ Rn | sup
t∈R

kπh ˜xg(t, x)k < ∞}

(which is called global CM) is invariant for (5). It is also a C 0-submanifold in
Rn. More precisely, there exists ψ ∈ C 0

b (Xc; Xh) such that

(6)

(7)

Mc = {xc + ψ(xc) | xc ∈ Xc};

(ii) Uniqueness: if φ ∈ C 0

b (Xc; Xh) is such that a manifold

Wφ = {xc + φ(xc) | xc ∈ Xc}

is invariant under (5), then Wφ = Mc and φ = ψ.

The proof of invariance and uniqueness of Mc is the same as in the proof
of Theorem 2.1 in [16], and we do not present it. The proof of existence of Mc
follows.

Lemma 2. Suppose g ∈ C 1

b (Rn), η+ ∈ (α+, β+) and η− ∈ (α−, β−). Then

Mc = {x ∈ Rn | max(sup

eη−tk˜xg(t, x)k) < ∞}.

(8)

Proof. The proof is based on the variation-of-constants formula

˜xg(t, x) = eA(t−t0)˜xg(t0, x) +

eA(t−τ )g(˜xg(τ, x))dτ,

(9)

which holds for all t, t0 ∈ R.

eA(t−τ )πcg(˜xg(τ, x))dτ.

It can be shown similarly that

which together with (10) and (12) yields

max(sup
t>0

e−η+tk˜xg(t, x)k, sup
t<0

eη−tk˜xg(t, x)k) < ∞.

Conversely, assume that x ∈ Rn is from the set (8). Project (9) onto Xu

to obtain

πu ˜xg(t, x) = eA(t−t0)πu ˜xg(t0, x) +

eA(t−τ )πug(˜xg(τ, x))dτ.

For a ﬁxed t ∈ R, t0 ≥ max(0, t) and ǫ ∈ (0, β+ − η+) Lemma 1 and (8) imply

= M(ǫ)Ce(β+−ǫ)te−(β+−η+−ǫ)t0.

(14)

The r.h.s. of (14) tends to zero when t0 → ∞. Consequently, in the limit
t0 → ∞ (13) takes the form

πu ˜xg(t, x) = −

eA(t−τ )πug(˜xg(τ, x))dτ,

∀t ∈ R.

(15)

Thus, for any ǫ ∈ (0, β+) and any t ∈ R

kπu ˜xg(t, x)k ≤ M(ǫ)kgk0

e(β+−ǫ)(t−τ )dτ = (β+ − ǫ)−1M(ǫ)kgk0.

Together, (16) and (18) imply (6). The proof of Lemma 2 is completed.

Deﬁnition 1. For a vector η = (η+, η−), where η+, η− ≥ 0, Yη is the Banach

Yη = {y ∈ C 0(R; Rn) | kykη = sup
t∈R

e−η(t)ky(t)k < ∞},

η(t) =

η+t
−η−t

(

if t ≥ 0,
if t < 0.

The inequality ζ ≥ η means that ζ+ ≥ η+ and ζ− ≥ η−, and ζ > η – that
if ζ ≥ η, then
ζ+ > η+ and ζ− > η−. Yη are a scale of Banach spaces:
Yη ⊂ Yζ , and the embedding is continuous

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

kykζ ≤ kykη,

∀y ∈ Yη.

In this notation, the manifold (8) can be expressed as

Mc = {x ∈ Rn | ˜xg(·, x) ∈ Yη}

= {y(0) | y ∈ Yη and y solves (5)}

(21)

for some

η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−).

The scale of Banach spaces Yη, η > 0, employed in the proof of the con-
ventional CM theorem [16], coincides with the scale (19), where η = η− = η+;
the spaces for 0 < η < β are employed, where β = min(β+, β−) (cf. (19) for
α+ = α− = 0).

As it was shown in the proof of Lemma 2, (11), (15) and (17) hold for
˜xg(t, x) on the CM. Summing up these equations we ﬁnd that x ∈ Rn belongs
to Mc if and only if ∀t ∈ R

Lemma 3. Suppose g ∈ C 1

b (Rn), η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−) and y ∈ Yη.
Then y is a solution to (5) if and only if there exists xc ∈ Xc, such that for

The proof is identical to the proof of Lemma 2.8 in [16] and it is omitted here.

Let Σ be the set of all (xc, y) ∈ Xc × Yη such that (24) holds; (21) implies

Mc = {y(0) | (xc, y) ∈ Σ} = {xc + πhy(0) | (xc, y) ∈ Σ},

(25)

since πcy(0) = xc for any (xc, y) ∈ Σ. To determine the set Σ, rewrite (24) in
the form

y = Sxc + KG(y)

(26)

where the following notation is used:

Sxc : R → Rn,

(Sxc)(t) = eAtxc ∀xc ∈ Xc;

Lemma 4. S is a bounded operator from Xc to Yη for any η+ > α+ and

Proof. Lemma 1 implies that for any η+ > α+

keAtxck ≤ M(η+ − α+)eη+tkxck,

∀t > 0,

and for any η− > α−

Hence

keAtxck ≤ M(η− − α−)e−η−tkxck,

∀t < 0.

kSxckη ≤ max(M(η+ − α+), M(η− − α−))kxck,

∀xc ∈ Xc.

Lemma 5. If g ∈ C 0

b (Rn), then G maps C 0(R; Rn) into C 0

b (R; Rn), and G

maps each Yη, η ≥ 0, into itself. If g ∈ C 1

b (Rn), then for any η > 0

kG(y1) − G(y2)kη ≤ |g|1ky1 − y2kη,

∀y1, y2 ∈ Yη.

Proof. The ﬁrst part is obvious. If g ∈ C 1

b (Rn), y1, y2 ∈ Yη, then

e−η+tkG(y1) − G(y2)k = sup

t>0

e−η+t|g|1ky1(t) − y2(t)k ≤ |g|1ky1(t) − y2(t)kη.

A similar inequality holds for negative t. Thus, by virtue of (19) and (20), the
proof is complete.

Lemma 6. For any η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−) the operator K : Yη → Yη is
bounded; there exists a continuous function γ : (α+, β+) × (α−, β−) → R such
that

kKkη ≤ γ(η),

∀η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−).

Proof. Suppose η+ ∈ (α+, β+), η− ∈ (α−, β−), y ∈ Yη and t > 0. The

Thus K ∈ L(Yη). The norm of K is bounded by the function γ(η+, η−),
deﬁned as the maximum of the sums (29) and (30); this is a continuous function
of the two arguments. The proof of Lemma 6 is complete.

Lemma 7. If η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−) and g ∈ C 1

b (Rn) is such that

κ = kKkη|g|1 < 1

then (I − K ◦ G) is a homeomorphism on Yη, whose inverse Ψ : Yη → Yη is
Lipschitzian with the Lipschitz constant κ, and

Σ = {(xc, Ψ(Sxc)) | xc ∈ Xc}.

The proof is identical to the proof of Lemma 2.12 in [16].

We ﬁnish now the proof of Theorem 1. For a γ(η) satisfying (28), denote

(31)

(32)

δ0 =

sup
η∈(α+,β+)×(α−,β−)

γ(η)−1.

b (Rn) and |g|1 < δ0, there exists η ∈ (α+, β+) × (α−, β−) such that
If g ∈ C 1
|g|1γ(η) < 1. By (28) this implies (31) and therefore (32) holds. Combining
it with (25), obtain (7) with ψ : Xc → Xh deﬁned by

ψ(xc) = πhΨ(Sxc)(0),

∀xc ∈ Xc.

(33)

Since Ψ is continuous, ψ is also continuous. Moreover, since Ψ = (I −K ◦ G)−1
by deﬁnition,

Ψ(Sxc) = Sxc + KG(Ψ(Sxc)).

From the deﬁnitions of S, G and K it follows that

ψ(xc) =

B(−τ )g(Sxc)(τ )dτ,

Thus, the bounds (23) imply

kψ(xc)k < (M(ǫ+)(β+ − ǫ+)−1 + M(ǫ−)(β− − ǫ−)−1)|g|0

∀xc ∈ Xc, ∀ǫ+ ∈ (α+, β+), ∀ǫ− ∈ (α−, β−).

Finally, note that ψ ∈ C 0
Lipschitzian and (33) holds. The Theorem is proved.

b (Rn) is globally Lipschitzian, because Ψ is globally

additional assumptions.

Theorem 2. Let the spectrum of A ∈ L(Rn) in (5) be split as σ(A) =

σu ∪ σc ∪ σs in accordance with (2), with α± and β± (see (3) ) satisfying

α+ < β+/l

and α− < β−/l

9

for some l ≥ 1. Then for each k, 1 ≤ k ≤ l, there exists δk ∈ (0, δ0] such that
if g ∈ C k
b (Rn) and |g|1 < δk, then the unique global center manifold Mc of (5)
is C k. More precisely, the mapping ψ constructed in Theorem 1 belongs to
C k

b (Xc, Xh).

Since ψ(xc) = πhΨ(Sxc)(0), it is suﬃcient to show that the mapping Ψ
constructed in Lemma 7 is C k. Then the smoothness might be established
by application of the implicit function theorem to the equation (26), if the
operator G were C k. The diﬃculty is that as a mapping from Yη into itself
G is not in general diﬀerentiable. But G ∈ C k(Yη, Yζ), if g ∈ C k
b (Rn) and
ζ > kη. The proof of Theorem 2 employs the following Lemma.

Lemma 8. Suppose g ∈ C k

b (Rn) for some k ≥ 1. Let η, ζ ∈ (α+, β+) ×

(α−, β−) be such that ζ > kη. Suppose

κ = sup

kKkξ|g|1 < 1.

ξ∈[η,ζ]

(34)

Then the mapping Ψ : Yη → Yη constructed in Lemma 7 belongs to C k(Yη, Yζ).
More precisely,

Ψ − Jη,ζ ∈ C k

b (Yη; Yζ ),

where Jη,ζ is the embedding of Yη into Yζ .

The proof of this Lemma coincides with the proof of Lemma 3.2 of [16]
(pp. 104-115) after replacement of η, ζ and ξ by η, ζ and ξ, respectively. We
do not repeat it here.

Proof of Theorem 2. For each k ≥ 1 denote

δk =

sup
η∈(α,β/k)

inf
ξ∈[η,kη]

γ(ξ)−1,

where γ is the function constructed in Lemma 6. If g ∈ C k
b (Rn) and |g|1 < δk,
then there exists η ∈ (α, β/k) such that |g|1 < inf{γ(ξ)−1 | ξ ∈ [η, kη]}.
Since γ is continuous, this implies existence of ζ ∈ (kη, β) such that |g|1 <
inf{γ(ξ)−1 | ξ ∈ [η, ζ]}. By (28) this implies (34). It follows from Lemma
8 that Ψ ∈ C k(Yη, Yζ ), all its derivatives being globally bounded. Since S :
Xc → Yη is a bounded linear operator (Lemma 4), the mapping xc → Ψ(Sxc)
is also C k(Xc, Yζ) with all its derivatives globally bounded. Hence (33) implies
that ψ ∈ C k

b (Xc; Xh). The proof is complete.

1.3. The local CM theorem

Theorems 1 and 2 hold for all functions g, bounded by certain constants.
Now let us return to the equation (1), where f does not satisfy this condition.
Theorem 3. Suppose f ∈ C k(Rn), k ≥ 1, and f (0) = 0. Split the set of
eigenvalues of A = Df (0) in agreement with (2): σ(A) = σu ∪ σc ∪ σs. Assume

α+ < β+/k and α− < β−/k

(35)

10

(α± and β± are deﬁned by (3) ). Then there exists ψ ∈ C k
b (Xc, Xh) (Xc
and Xh denote the respective center and hyperbolic subspaces) and an open
neighborhood Ω of the origin in Rn such that

(i) ψ(0) = 0 and Dψ(0) = 0;
(ii) the manifold

is locally invariant for (1), i.e.

Wψ = {xc + ψ(xc) | xc ∈ Xc}

˜x(t, x) ∈ Wψ,

∀x ∈ Wψ ∩ Ω, ∀t ∈ JΩ(x)

(iii) if x ∈ Ω and JΩ(x) = R, then x ∈ Wψ.

To prove Theorem 3, apply Theorems 1 and 2 to the system

˙x = Ax + ˜fρ(x),

˜fρ(x) = ˜f (x)χ(ρ−1x),

∀x ∈ Rn,

and χ is a smooth cut-oﬀ function χ : Rn → R with the following properties:
(i) 0 ≤ χ ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ Rn;
(ii) χ(x) = 1, if kxk ≤ 1;
(iii) χ(x) = 0, if kxk ≥ 2.
The constant ρ can be chosen small enough, so that the system (36) satisﬁes
conditions of the Theorems. Equations (1) and (36) coincide in Ω = {x ∈ Rn |
kxk ≤ ρ}.

If x ∈ Ω and JΩ(x) = R, then ˜x(·, x) = ˜xρ(·, x) is a bounded solution to
(36) and, according to (6), belongs to its global CM, thus implying x ∈ Wψ.

If the unstable spectrum is empty, the CM is attracting. The proof is the

same as in the case of a conventional CM theorem.

2. CM theorem for inﬁnite-dimensional systems

Let X, Y and Z be Banach spaces with X continuously embedded in Y ,

and Y continuously embedded in Z. Consider a diﬀerential equation

˙x = Ax + g(x),

(37)

where A ∈ L(X, Z) and g ∈ C k(X, Y ), k ≥ 1.

Deﬁnition 2. For a vector η = (η+, η−), where η± ≥ 0, and a Banach space

E, deﬁne a Banach space BCη(R, E):

BCη(R, E) = {w ∈ C 0(R; E) | kwkη = sup
t∈R

e−η(t)kw(t)kE < ∞},

(38)

where η(t) is deﬁned by (20).

11

Assume the operator A satisﬁes the following hypothesis (H):

There exists a continuous projection πc ∈ L(Z, X) onto a ﬁnite-dimensional

subspace Zc = Xc ⊂ X, such that

Aπcx = πcAx,

∀x ∈ X,

and such that for

Zh = (I − πc)(Z), Xh = (I − πc)(X),

Yh = (I − πc)(Y ),

Ac = A|Xc ∈ L(Xc), Ah = A|Xh ∈ L(Xh, Zh),

the following statements hold:

(i) there exist α+ ≥ 0 and α− ≥ 0 such that

−α− ≤ Reλ ≤ α+ ∀λ ∈ σ(Ac);

(ii) there exist β− and β+, β± > kα±, such that for any η = (η−, η+), η± ∈
[0, β±), and for any f ∈ BCη(R, Yh) the linear problem

˙xh = Ahxh + f (t),

xh ∈ BCη(R, Xh)

has a unique solution xh = Khf , where Kh ∈ L(BCη(R, Yh), BCη(R, Xh))
and

kKhkη ≤ γ(η)

for a continuous function γ : [0, β−) × [0, β+) → R+.

Lemma 8. Assume (H) and g ∈ C 0

b (X, Y ). Let ˜x : R → X be a solution
of (37), and let η = (η−, η+) ∈ (α−, β−) × (α+, β+). Then the following
statements are equivalent:
(i) ˜x ∈ BCη(R, X);
(ii) ˜x ∈ BCξ(R, X),
(iii) πh ˜x ∈ C 0
b (R, Xh).

∀ξ = (ξ−, ξ+), ξ± > α±;

The proof is identical to that of Lemma 1 in [17].

Lemma 9. Assume (H) and g ∈ C 0

b (X, Y ). Let ˜x ∈ BCη(R, X) for some
η = (η−, η+) ∈ (α−, β−) × (α+, β+). Then ˜x is a solution of (37) if and only if

˜x(t) = eActπc ˜x(0) +

eAc(t−s)πcg(˜x(s))ds + Kh(πhg(˜x))(t),

∀t ∈ R.

The Lemma is identical to Lemma 2 of [17].

Theorem 4. Assume (H). Then there exist δ0 > 0 such that for all
b (X, Y ), which are globally Lipschitz with the Lipschitz constant |g|Lip

g ∈ C 0,1
satisfying

(39)

|g|Lip < δ0,

12

there exist a unique ψ ∈ C 0,1
˜x : R → X the following statements are equivalent:
(i) ˜x is a solution of (37) and ˜x ∈ BCη(R, X) for some η = (η−, η+) ∈
(α−, β−) × (α+, β+);

b (Xc, Xh) possessing the property that for all

(ii) πh ˜x(t) = ψ(πc ˜x(t)) for all t ∈ R and πc ˜x : R → Xc is a solution of the
equation

˙xc = Acxc + πcg(xcψ(xc)).

(40)

As pointed out in [17], the proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1 in [16]
and is the same as the proof of Theorem 1 in the present paper.
The Theorem implies that, assuming (H) and g ∈ C 0,1

b (X, Y ) satisfying

(39), the problem

with η = (η−, η+) ∈ (α−, β−) ×(α+, β+) has for each xc ∈ Xc a unique solution

˙x = Ax + g(x)
πcx(0) = xc, x ∈ BCη(R, X)

(

˜x(t, xc) = ˜xc(t, xc) + ψ(˜xc(t, xc)),

where ˜xc(t, xc) is the unique solution of (40) satisfying xc(0) = xc.

As in the ﬁnite-dimensional case (Section 1), the set

Mc = {xc + ψ(xc)|xx ∈ Xc} ⊂ X

is called the global center manifold of (37).

Theorem 5. Assume (H). Then for any l ≤ k there exist δl > 0, such
b(Vρ, Y ), with Vρ = {x ∈ X|kπhxk < ρ} and ρ >

b (X, Y ) ∩ C l

that if g ∈ C 0,1
kKhk0|πhg|0,

|g|Lip < δl

(41)

the mapping ψ given by Theorem 1 belongs to the space C l

b(Xc, Xh).

Similarly to Theorem 4, the proof follows the proof of Theorem 2 for ﬁnite-
dimensional systems.

Theorem 6. Assume (H), g ∈ C k(X, Y ) for k ≥ 1, g(0) = 0 and Dg(0) = 0.
Then there exist a neighborhood Ω of the origin in X and a mapping ψ ∈
C k
b (Xc, Xh) with ψ(0) = 0 and Dψ(0) = 0 such that the following statements
hold:

(i) if ˜xc : I → Xc is a solution of (40) such that ˜x(t) = ˜xc(t) + ψ(˜xc(t)) ∈ Ω
for all t ∈ I, then ˜x : I → X is a solution of (37);

(ii) if ˜x : R → X is a solution of (37) such that ˜x(t)) ∈ Ω for all t ∈ R, then

πh ˜x(t) = ψ(πc ˜x(t)),

∀t ∈ R,

13

and πc ˜x : R → Xc is a solution of (40).

Unlike in the cases of Theorems 4 and 5, the proof is diﬀerent from the one
for ﬁnite-dimensional systems, since the cut-oﬀ function χ ∈ C k
b (X, R) used
in the proof of Theorem 3 does not always exist for a general Banach space X.
The proof for inﬁnite-dimensional systems given in [17] involves construction
of a cut-oﬀ function from the ﬁnite-dimensional Xc to R.

3. The Navier-Stokes equation

Consider the Navier-Stokes equation

∂v
∂t

= v × (∇ × v) − ∇p + ν∆v + f

subject to the incompressibility condition

∇ · v = 0,

where the force f is a smooth bounded function, deﬁned in a bounded domain
Ω ⊂ R3 with a smooth boundary ∂Ω.

We assume one of the following boundary conditions:

space-periodic:

no-slip:

v(x) = v(x + T), T ∈ R3;

v|∂Ω = 0.

Our theory is equally applicable to other commonly used boundary conditions,
e.g. stress-free and periodicity in one (the Taylor-Couette problem) or two
directions (in a layer).

Denote by F the space of functions, satisfying the boundary conditions

Let v0 be a steady solution of (42), (43) with (44) or (45). For v = v0 + w,

(44) or (45).

(42) reduces to

where

We set

∂w
∂t

= Aw + N(w),

Aw = π0(ν∆w + v0 × (∇ × w) + w × (∇ × v0)),

N(w) = π0(w × (∇ × w)).

Z = {w ∈ F ∩ (L2(Ω))3| ∇ · w = 0},

denote by π0 the orthogonal projection of (L2(Ω))3 onto Z, and deﬁne

X = Z ∩ (H2(Ω))3,

Y = Z ∩ (H1(Ω))3.

It is shown in [17] that A ∈ L(X, Z) and N ∈ C ∞(X, Y ). Since A is an
elliptic operator, for any constant C it has a ﬁnite number of eigenvalues with
Reλ > C (counting with multiplicities).

Theorem 6 is applicable to the Navier-Stokes equation, if the equation
satisﬁes the hypothesis (H). Decompose the spectrum of the operator A,
σ(A) ⊂ C, into a disjoint union of the stable spectrum σs, the center spectrum
σc and the unstable spectrum σu, where

σs = {λ ∈ σ | Reλ < −β−},

σc = {λ ∈ σ | −α− ≤ Reλ ≤ α+},

(47)

σu = {λ ∈ σ | Reλ > β+}

with β± > kα± ≥ 0. Due to the properties of the operator A stated above,
it can be easily examined for a particular bifurcation by computing several
eigenvalues with the largest real parts for the system linearized in the vicinity
of the steady state, whether for a given k such constants α± and β± can be
found that (47) can be constructed.

If the decomposition (47) can be constructed, the Navier-Stokes equation

satisﬁes the following hypothesis (Σ):
± ≥ 0 and β′
There exist α′
(i) σ(A) ∩[α′
−, α′
associated with a ﬁnite-dimensional generalized eigenspace;
(ii) ([β′

± such that

+]) × iR ⊂ ρ(A);

± > kα′

−, α′

(iii) there exist constants ω0 > 0, C > 0 and α ∈ [0, 1) such that for all ω ∈ R
with |ω| ≥ ω0 we have iω ∈ ρ(A),

k(iω − A)−1kL(Z) ≤

and k(iω − A)−1kL(X,Y ) ≤

C
|ω|

C
|ω|1−α ,

where ρ(A) is the resolvent set of A.
In [17] the hypothesis (Σ) with α′
± = 0 is employed, and it is shown that it
holds for the Navier-Stokes equation. Their proof can be easily extended for
our case (the condition (47) is required to allow for non-vanishing α′
±). A
trivial modiﬁcation of arguments of [17] proves (Σ) ⇒ (H). Thus Theorem 6
is applicable for the Navier-Stokes equation under the condition (47).

The equation (42) involves the parameter ν (and possibly others, e.g. in-
cluded into the force f). Denote by µ all parameters of the system. CM can
be made parameters dependent by the standard [8] extension of the system by
considering the parameters as variables and setting ˙µ = 0. Evidently, Theo-
rem 6 is applicable to the extended system, if it is applicable to the original
one.

Conclusion

We have proved CM theorems, including the one for inﬁnite-dimensional
systems, under less restrictive assumptions than those required by existing
theorems. Although the proof is just a modiﬁcation of the existing proofs [16,
17], the new variant of the theorem (Theorem 6) is important for applications,
providing a more powerful tool for investigation of bifurcations in dynamical
systems of inﬁnite dimensions. Its advantage was demonstrated by applying
our theorem to the ABC-forced Navier-Stokes equation [12, 13].

The demonstration that the theorem is applicable for the Navier-Stokes
equation (if additional inequalities for eigenvalues of the linearization in a
vicinity of a steady state hold) relies only on the fact that the linearization is
an elliptic operator. Thus, it can be easily extended to accommodate other
boundary conditions, the Rayleigh-B´enard convection, magnetohydrodynamic
and other systems.

Abstract

The response of inviscid incompressible unbounded ﬂuid subject to a localized

external perturbation is studied. The physically relevant hypotheses on the mode

coupling mechanisms is justiﬁed by renormalization-group method. The scaling laws

for the scalar and vector velocity potentials are derived. The spectrum of energy of

perturbed ﬂuid versus the distance apart from perturbation is computed.

1 Introduction

The excitation of wave motion in a ﬂuid by various perturbative factors is a long-standing

problem in hydrodynamics. Particularly, the wave generation on the water surface by

turbulent air ﬂow over the surface and the rising of tsunamy-like waves excited by bottom

earthquakes are of current interest of modern ocean studies. The physical mechanisms

coupling the perturbation and water must be understood in order to describe the wave

motions on the ocean surface. In spite of great success in the description of statistical

properties of water waves which have been achieved recently in the framework of so-called

Zakharov formalism (see, for example [1] and references therein) many phenomena on the

ocean surface remain unclear. The great advances in study of surface phenomena were

achieved in the modern critical phenomena theory recently [2]. They are due to employ

of quantum ﬁeld theory methods and quantum ﬁeld renormalization group method (RG)

[3] in particular which are designed to describe systems with an inﬁnite number of degrees

of freedom. The results indicate convincingly that the analogous approach would also be

of great advantage in the explanation of ocean surface phenomena. We intend to propose

the statistical description of ocean surface phenomena within the framework of modern

critical phenomena theory [4]. In the present paper we consider a simple physical model

coupling water to perturbation which can be adopted for the use of RG method. Our

aim is to outline the basic properties of such a model for what purpose we now limit

our consideration to the case of inviscid incompressible unbounded ﬂuid. The work is

concerned with the large-distance and long-time asymptotic behavior of water response

for an external localized perturbation risen by a pressure ﬁeld pulse; it is imposed that

the scale of perturbation lp is much less than the main scale of the problem r ≫ lp.
The duration τ of energy input provided by the pressure pulse determines the scale of

perturbed region

lp = cτ,

(1)

where c is a speed of perturbation spread in ﬂuid. We are interested in the statistical

properties of water response in the range r ≫ lp and t ≫ τ . The crucial importance
for the what following is that the time derivative can be eliminated from hydrodynamic

equations,

div v(x, t) = 0, ∆p(x, t) = −∂ivj(x, t)∂jvi(x, t),

(2)

where v(x, t) is the velocity of ﬂuid, p(x, t) is the ﬁeld of pressure, and ∆ is the Laplace

diﬀerential operator. We have taken in (2) the constant ﬂuid density to be ρ0 = 1.
Summation over successive indices will be implied. x Then from (2) one obtains an

expression for the pressure p(x, t) :

p(x, t) = −

dy

ZVp

∂ivj(y, t)∂jvi(y, t)
|x − y|

,

(3)

where the integration is brought about over the perturbed region Vp. It is essential that
(2) is invariant with respect to an arbitrary time-dependent velocity shift:

va(x, t) → v(x + s, t) − a(t),

p(x, t) → p(x + s, t)

(4)

where a(t) is an arbitrary function of time decreasing at t → −∞, and s(t) =

t
−∞ a(t′) dt′.
This property expresses the Galilean invariancy of hydrodynamic equations. The conti-

R

nuity equation in (2) shows that the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) can be presented as a sum of

two terms

v(x, t) = −grad φ(x, t) + rot A(x, t),

(5)

Critical Behavior...

where φ(x, t) and A(x, t) are the scalar and vector potentials consequently. The formu-

lation of hydrodynamic equations in favor of the potentials ϕ = {φ, Ai} elucidates the
invariancy of the equations with respect to the shift of the vector potential Ai,

Ai(x) 7−→ Ai(x) − ∂iΛ(x)

in which Λ(x) is an arbitrary scalar function. This invariancy expresses the gauge symme-

try of hydrodynamic equations. In the present paper we shall consider the consequences

of this invariancy for the hydrodynamic equations (2) for the inviscid unbounded in-

compressible ﬂuid. Signiﬁcant results on stationary spectra of the fully developed water

response for the perturbative pulse may be derived phenomenologically in analogy with

the fully developed turbulence theory [5] and the statistical theory of waves based on the

Zakharov’s kinetic equations [6]. This approach is related to some conserved quantities,

i.e., the wave action, energy, or momentum and to the idea of localization of pumping and

dissipation ranges in separated parts of scale spectrum. By the way, a stationary spec-

trum can have place for some scale interval which is transparent for the current of some
quantity. For example, one can point out the well-known inertial range of Kolmogorov in

the theory of fully developed turbulence which is transparent for the energy current from

the large-scale region of energy pumping to the small-scale range of viscous dissipation. In

the Kolmogorov’s inertial range the energy distribution versus wave-numbers is described

by the Five Thirds Kolmogorov’s Law. In case of the fully developed turbulence the Law

of Five Thirds describes the only possible spectrum since the three-dimensional isotropic
movements of the inviscid incompressible ﬂuid preserve the only integral quantity, i.e., the

energy. However, in the problem discussed there are variety of spectra to be realized, since

in the process of perturbation spread there are two more conserved integral quantities:

the net momentum of ﬂuid and the enstrophy. In case of an isotropic, O(3)-symmetrical,

perturbation the net momentum of ﬂuid is equal to zero, however, even in this case there

are two diﬀerent spectra which are determined by the energy W− and the enstrophy

E−currents. The velocity spectrum which is determined by the energy current from the

pumping region kp = 0 into the dissipation region kd = ∞ is the well-known spectrum of
the fully developed turbulence theory,

However, in the case considered kp > k0 ≃ 1/lp 6= 0 and kd ≫ k0, so that the relevant
inertial range lies apart from the scale spectrum k0 > k ≃ 1/r, and (7) cannot have
place in the problem considered. The enstrophy current (the squared averaged vorticity)

determines the spectrum for the vector potential ﬁeld A in the form

W 1/3k−1/3 ≃ v(k).

E 1/2k ≃ A(k)

(8)

which transparency interval is exactly the interval in question. In language of the critical
phenomena theory the spectrum (8) determines the critical dimension ∆[A] of the ﬁeld

A, ∆[A] = 1. The use of critical dimension allows to compute the spectrum of any

correlation function of the ﬁeld A by simple dimensional counting. For example, for the
pair correlation function in Fourier representation DA(k) ≡ hA(k)A(−k)i, one obtains
an asymptotics:

DA(k) ∼ k∆[DA], ∆[DA] = 2∆[A] − d,

where d is the dimension of space. For practical purposes, however, it is important to

discuss not the correlation function (9) but a one-dimensional spectrum

in which Sd ≡ 2πd/2/Γ(d/2) is the square of surface of the unit sphere in d−dimensional
space. For (10) one obtains from (9):

Furthermore, the phenomenological considerations analogous to (8) readily allows to de-

termine the spectra of some quantities which can be measured in experiments, for example,

for the energy as a function of distance from the perturbation point, E(r), we obtain

ˆDA =

Sd
2(2π)d kd−1DA(k)

ˆDA ∼ k.

Er−4 ≃ E(r).

(12)

From phenomenology, however, it is not possible to ﬁx the spectra of all quantities si-

multaneously. For example, one has nothing to say about the scalar potential spectrum

φ(k). To determine it one can add some extra assumptions on the character of coupling

mechanisms between diﬀerent modes of ﬂuid motions. Actually, the formulation of such a

hypotheses is the crucial point of the problem of coupling water to perturbations. Clearly,

these additional assumptions will suﬃciently depend on the geometry of perturbation. As

we have seen above, in some cases the perturbation pulse can rise a ﬂuid current, then

the net momentum of ﬂuid P will be nontrivial. The new quantity conserved in the scale

interval of the problem will leads to another possible spectrum. In the present paper we

discuss the case of O(3)−symmetrical perturbation; we consider the case with a current

aligned in the ﬂuid in the forthcoming paper. Even for the simplest case of P = 0 the

formulation of physically relevant hypotheses on coupling water to perturbation is a non-

trivial problem due to an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. To solve it we apply the

RG approach under the following reason: In the framework of RG method the physical

degrees of freedom are to be replaced by the scaling degrees which are related to the phys-

ical degrees through the RG transformations of ﬁelds and parameters of the theory. Since

Critical Behavior...

5

the properties of scaling degrees of freedom possess a group structure (the renormalization

group) one investigates them much easier then those of the origin problem. The results

obtained from RG-analysis are considered as somewhat statistical steady state limit of

the physical system. The renormalized correlation functions are distinguished from their

physical analogies only by normalization conditions, so that they can be also used for the

analysis of asymptotic properties of the physical system. The plan of the paper follows:

In the Section 2 we consider the direct consequences of the symmetry (6) for the hydrody-

namic equations (2). As a result we derive an eﬀective action functional which allows to

understand the water response on the local perturbation as a critical phenomenon. The

action functional presented has the most general form and then needs to be supplied by an

assumption on the coupling mechanism. To formulate the physically relevant hypotheses

we develop the RG-analysis in the Sections 3, 4, and 5 consequently. We show that in the

symmetrical case considered (P = 0) the statistical properties of water response are man-
aged by the dynamics of vector potential A. This conclusion instantly ﬁxes the spectra

of all quantities of the theory. In the Sections 6 and 7 we discuss the various composite

operators of the theory which are responsible for the amendments to critical scaling and

for the spectra of some quantities which can be measured experimentally. In particular,

in the Section 7 we compute the one-dimensional energy spectrum E(r) as a function of

distance from the point of perturbation. The results obtained for the spectra of the pair

correlation function DA and the energy E meet the phenomenological relations (11) and
(12). We believe that the obtained results would give a key for better understanding of

the origin of a numerous ocean phenomena such as Lengmuir circulations, spin-oﬀ eddies,

and so on which theoretical justiﬁcation have not given by this time.

2 The Description of Model and the Eﬀective Action

Functional

In this section we formulate a real time classical ﬁeld theory of equations (2) in the

Lagrange formalism and a model of nonlinear coupling mechanism between diﬀerent wave

modes. As a result we derive the eﬀective action functional of abelian gauge-invariant

ﬁeld theory which describes the statistical properties of long-range water response on the

external perturbation. We consider now the basic properties of the theory following from

the symmetry (6).

(i) First, the eddy component of velocity ﬁeld is expressed by a gauge invariant tensor,

F k = (rot A)k = ∂iAj − ∂jAi.

(13)

Critical Behavior...

6

(14)

(ii) Second, in accordance to the Noether’s theorem the symmetry (6) relates to a

conserved current, vorticity,

∂iJi = 0,

∂tJi = 0,

where Ji = ∂jF k − ∂kF j, (i 6= k 6= j).

(iii) Third, the classical equations (2) do not lead to a hamiltonian in the usual way:

as a direct consequence of gauge invariance, the equations (2) do not depend on time

derivative. It is therefore impossible to deﬁne the conjugated momenta, [4]. Nevertheless,

(2) are just the ﬁeld equations which can be derived from the classical lagrangian L(ϕ, p) :

L(ϕ, p) =

F2 + p∂ivj∂jvi + JiAi

(cid:21)

where we have introduced the tensor vivj ≡ (∂iφ)(∂jφ) + F iF j − ∂iφF j − ∂jφF i. The
statistical properties of mechanical system can be derived from the partition function of
statistical mechanics Z = T r(e−S) with somewhat classical dimensionless action S. In

case of an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom one can write down the partition function

in functional integral representation:

.

(17)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

Here we note that the quadratic part of the action functional (17) which is relevant to a
free theory, i.e., with no coupling between water and perturbation is not symmetrical with

respect to Galilean transformation (4) but is symmetrical with respect to the following

transformations

Ai(x) 7−→ Ai(x) − ∂iΛ(x),
φ(x) 7−→ φ(x)eiu0Λ(x),




(18)

where Λ(x) as usual is an arbitrary scalar function, and u0 is a potential coupling constant.
These transformations expresses the so-called U(1)−gauge symmetry (U(1) is the group



of multiplication by complex numbers). The last term in (17) does not meet the entire

symmetry (18) but preserves the simple gauge symmetry (6). This symmetry breaking

shows that the pressure ﬁeld as it is included in the action functional contains somewhat

redundant degrees of freedom.

Instantly close to the region of perturbation the pressure pulse rises the wave motions

with eigenmodes k > k0 ≃ 1/lp. Due to strong nonlinearity of the interaction in the
Navier-Stockes equation the eigenmodes of oscillations spread very fast from a band of

Critical Behavior...

p

over the whole spectrum, and various multipole oscillations of any type are

arisen with time. One can say that after a short period of time motions of any modes are

present in the water. Clearly, the long-distance ﬂuid behavior will depend to some extent

on the statistical properties of wave mode coupling.

Assuming an eﬀective action functional to be
(i) local in space and time, i.e., it depends only on the ﬁelds A(x) and φ(x) and their

partial derivatives (and not on products of ﬁelds and their derivatives at diﬀerent points),
(ii) invariant under space and time translations, i.e., space and time coordinates do

not appear explicitly in the action, we now suppose the simplest model for the coupling
mechanism by inclusion of the ϕ4-type interaction term into (17):

S(ϕ, p) =

dx

(∂p)2 + (∂φ)2 +

ij + p∂ivj∂jvi +

gϕ4

,

(19)

(cid:21)

with a wave modes coupling constant g. In accordance with the general critical phenomena
approach we note that the accounting of highest oscillation harmonics, i.e., ϕ6, ϕ8 and

so on cannot alter the large-distance asymptotic behavior of water response for localized

pressure pulse if g 6= 0 [7].

Since the pressure pulse is localized in the scale l < lp, and the locality postulated for
the action functional requires redundant degrees of freedom for the ﬂuctuating pressure
ﬁeld p(x, t), we therefore can integrate it over in the partition function (16). The result of

functional integration does not depend on p(x, t). Due to (3) this procedure is of perfect

clarity and is reduced technically to elimination of the quadratic term proportional to
(∂p)2 from (19) and to replacement of the pressure ﬁeld p(x, t) in the U(1)− breaking

term p∂ivj∂jvi by (3). In particular, it leads to a new term in (19) of the form

1
2 Z

dx ∂ivj(x, t)∂jvi(x, t)

dy

(20)

ZVp
which relates the ﬂuctuations of velocity ﬁelds risen by the perturbation pulse in Vp to
the ﬂuctuations apart from the perturbed region. We note that (20) preserves the entire

∂ivj(y, t)∂jvi(y, t)
|x − y|

,

U(1)−gauge symmetry (18).

Performing the integration over Vp and moving the derivatives onto the result of inte-

gration, one can rearrange (20) to the form

1
2 Z

dxKij(x)Qij(ϕ, x, t),

(21)

where Qij is a quadratic form of potentials φ and Ai, and Kij is a source kernel. To explain
the meaning of (21) we adduce some arguments from renormalization group analysis which

we are going to apply to the theory discussed in the forthcoming sections. For the future

purposes of RG analysis we need only insertions at zero momentum and we could, in

Critical Behavior...

8

principle, restrict ourselves to constant sources Kij, since the renormalized action which
we derive for the case in question is obtained by setting Kij(x) as constant, [4].

Another important feature of (21) stems from the fact that the RG transformations
generate all possible linearly independent quadratic terms in Qij, i.e., φ2(x, t), φAi(x, t),
and AiAj(x, t). However, some certain linear combinations of quadratic operators in Qij
only are relevant to scaling degrees of freedom and possess, by the way, the deﬁnite

physical meaning. We compute all such linear combinations in the Section 6. Nevertheless,

one can see before calculations that the linear combinations of quadratic operators which

are of importance for the RG analysis have to be U(1)−gauge symmetrical. There is only
one such a combination, i.e.,

m2φ2(x)

(22)

in which m2 is somewhat mass parameter (the coeﬃcient of the relevant RG-invariant

operator). The use of Ward identities which express the U(1)−gauge invariancy of the

theory allows to show that all other combinations of quadratic operators are ultra-violet

(UV) ﬁnite, i.e., the relevant correlation functions do not have UV divergences. Thus, with

no loss of generality we can omit all combinations except for (22) from the consideration.

It leads to the action functional which follows

S(ϕ) =

ij + m2φ2 +

(23)

(cid:21)

The eﬀective action functional (23) which is arranged to describe the asymptotic properties

of water response is not renormalizable, and it has no solutions in the massless limit, when
m2 = 0,[4]. Again, the reason is that it still has some redundant degrees of freedom, the

gauge degrees, with unknown dynamics.

To construct a renormalizable theory we are led to introduce an abelian gauge geo-

metrical structure. By the way,

(i) φ(x) and φ∗(x) are vectors for U(1) transformations,

(ii) the derivative ∂i is replaced by the covariant derivative ∇i:

∇i = ∂i + iu0Ai,

(24)

where u0 is the coupling constant of interaction between the scalar and rotational compo-
nents of the velocity potential ϕ (analogous to the electron charge e in electrodynamics).

(iii) It follows that the curvature tensor is iu0Fij :

iu0Fij = [∇i, ∇j] = iu0(∂iAj − ∂jAi).

(iv) Since the U(1)-gauge group is abelian (A(x, t) is a translation invariant), one can

write the parallel transporter U(C) along any continuous contour C which is an element

Critical Behavior...

of U(1). In terms of a line integral:

(28)

(29)

U(C) = exp

Ai(s) dsi

(cid:20)

IC

(cid:21)

as a consequence of vorticity conservation. Thus, the rotational component of velocity

potential just carries on the ﬂuctuations of the scalar potential ﬁeld φ(x). By the way, two
solutions for diﬀerent points φ(x, t) and φ(y, t) are related through the parallel transporter

(25), where C is an integration path connecting the points x and y, [4].

The form of the action functional (23) which meets the geometrical structure (i)-(iv)

follows

The problem of the gauge invariant theory is that the local gauge invariant action does

not provide a dynamics to the gauge degrees of freedom. We take them into account,

performing the standard procedure analogous to the Fadeev-Popov quantization [4]. Let

us write the gauge ﬁeld Ai in terms of a gauge ﬁeld Bi projection of Ai on some gauge
section, i.e., satisfying some gauge condition, and a gauge transformation:

We assume that this decomposition is unique. For Λ(x) one imposes:

Ai = Bi + ∂iΛ.

∂2Λ(x) + ∂iBi(x) = h(x),

in which h(x) is a stochastic ﬁeld for which a probability distribution is given. We do
not include a term proportional to φ(x)eiΛ(x) in the condition (28) omitting the U(1)

gauge degrees of freedom to simplify the model and to avoid the appearance of Fadeev-

Popov ghost ﬁelds. Including the equation (28) in the functional integral for the partition

function, one can see that since the result does not depend on the dynamics of Λ(x) and
on the ﬁeld h(x) either, one can integrate over h(x) with the gaussian measure:

[dρ(h)] = [dh] exp

(cid:21)

In the forthcoming sections we show that the model (30) demonstrates the existence of a

statistically steady state independently of the details of velocity evolution. The functional

Critical Behavior...

10

(30) is analogous to a U(1)−invariant action for a charged scalar ﬁeld with a |φ|4 self-
interaction (so called Abelian Higgs Model, [9]). This theory allows the multiplicative

renormalization, [10] and for some values of the parameters {m0, g0, u0} the corresponding
physical system tends to a steady state in a large-distance limit and demonstrates a

universal behavior. In language of the critical phenomena theory, there is a nontrivial

IR-stable ﬁxed point which determines the critical asymptotics of correlation functions of

the ﬁelds φ(x) and A(x). The relevant critical index for A meets the phenomenological

result (8).

We conclude this section by an explanation of physical meaning of solutions for diﬀer-
ent signatures of the mass parameter m2. In case of A = 0 in (30), one has the standard

model of a scalar unharmonic oscillator. This model is, may be, the most popular and

well-investigated action of the modern theoretical physics. For m = 0 the oscillator is
subject to a phase transition. At the classical level in the symmetrical case (m2 > 0)

the oscillator model describes the ﬂuctuations having the trivial expectation value of the
ﬁeld, hφi0 = 0 (see Fig. 1.a). If m2 < 0, the system allows two possible expectation values
m2/g (see Fig. 1.b). The latter situation is usually referred to as
for the ﬁeld hφi0 = ±
spontaneously broken symmetry.

q

The physical consequences for the model considered can be readily understood. The
signature of integral operator kernel Kij(x, t) depends on the certain physical conditions
and on the geometry of perturbation, and it is determined directly by the signature of

operator ∂ivj∂jvi. This signature does not depend neither on the certain value of velocity
nor its evolution, but it depends on the topological properties of ﬂuid ﬂow risen by the

perturbation.

The case of symmetrical perturbation, when the net momentum of ﬂuid is equal to

zero (for example, on the surface of a large scale eddy, see Fig.2. a) can be described by
the model (30) with m2 > 0. In the vicinity of saddle points, ∂ivj∂jvi < 0, i.e., when there
is a net ﬂuid current from the region of initial perturbation into outside (see Fig.2.b), and
the net ﬂuid momentum P 6= 0, one can use (30) with m2 < 0.

In the what following sections of the present paper we shall consider the case of sym-
metrical perturbation, m2 > 0, (Fig.2. a). The presence of the gauge ﬁeld A aﬀects
suﬃciently the behavior of the system due to the transporting role of the ﬁeld A. We

demonstrate below that the ordinary infrared (IR)-stable ﬁxed point of RG transforma-
tions which is responsible for self-similar behavior in the standard φ4-theory turns out to

be unstable, however, the new ﬁxed point acquires stability for the real value ǫr = 1/2 of
the parameter 2ǫ = 4 − d. We shall derive formulae for universal scaling proﬁles to the

ﬁrst order in ǫ. The proﬁles has a power-law behavior for the large distances r ≫ lp.

3 Infrared Singularities of Perturbation Theory Dia-

grams

In the present Section we develop the diagram technique relevant to the theory (30)

and discuss the large-distance (k → 0, in momentum representation) singularities of

perturbation theory diagrams.

The model (30) can be considered in the d-dimensional space x with UV-cut oﬀ Λ ≡

k0 ≃ 1/lp. Each quantity in (30) corresponds to one (momentum) canonical dimensionality
df , which is completely determined by the space dimensionality d.

In the critical phenomena theory one seeks the asymptotic for correlation functions in
the region k, m ≪ Λ for which one considers g0 ≃ u2
0 ≃ const Λ4−d with const ≤ 1. From
now on we supply all the parameters in (30) by the lower index ”0” to distinguish them

from those in renormalized action forthcoming. In order to be speciﬁc we consider the
pair correlation functions of the potentials Dφ(r) = hφ(x)φ(y)i and DA(r) = hA(x)A(y)i
in which r = |x − y|.

In momentum representation these correlation functions are found from the Dyson

considering ǫ as a small parameter of a regular expansion which has 2ǫr = 1 as an actual
value. For 0 < 2ǫ < 1 the diagrams in Fig.3, independent of p and m0, have the algebraic
UV-divergent terms ∼ Λ2−2nǫ (where n is the order of perturbation theory) corresponding
to the simple shift of m2

this is implemented by subtracting their values for p = m0 = 0 from all graphs of Fig.3.

For p ∼ m0 ≪ Λ and ǫ > 0 the dimensionless parameter of the expansion g0p−2ǫ ∼
(Λp−1)2ǫ in (32) is not small, and it is necessary to sum the series. This problem is solved

by the RG method.

In a clearer formulation this problem reduces to a determination of the asymptotic

value of the propagator Dχ = D(χp, χm0) for χ → 0 (everything is ﬁxed except for χ).
This procedure is nontrivial for ǫ > 0 due to presence in the cn,l of poles in ǫ and leads to
the equations of RG which we shall consider in the next Section.

Another problem, which is occurred in the region m0 ≪ p, is connected with sin-
gularities of the coeﬃcient cn,l in (32) for m0/p → 0 and cannot be handled by RG.
This problem originates from the ﬁniteness of the physical value of ǫ. After removing of

UV divergences from diagrams of Fig.3 there are still diagrams diverging for m → 0 for

any ǫ > 0. This problem had been discussed in the critical phenomena theory where the

method of short distance expansion (SDE) was employed, [3]-[4]. We shall apply SDE to

compute the leading amendments to critical scaling of (30) with m2 > 0 in the Section 6.

Finally, we make a note on the particular features of perturbation series Fig.3 for

the gauge invariant theory. Some diagrams in Fig.3 have ζ−dependent poles which are

unphysical, since they have been introduced to make the theory renormalizable. The

renormalization constants of the gauge invariant theory as we shall deﬁne them later on

are gauge independent, therefore we can ﬁx the value of the gauge parameter ζ in certain

calculations.

In particular, we use the Landau gauge (ζ = 0), so that the gauge ﬁeld

propagator is simply proportional to the transversal projector Pij.

4 Renormalization-Group Equations. Scaling Degrees

of Freedom

Now we discuss the renormalization procedure for the model (30) and produce the renor-

malized action functional, then we derive the RG equations for renormalized correlation

functions. Renormalizability of the theory (30) (the Abelian Higgs Model) for any value

of the gauge parameter ζ < ∞, is proven (see for example [10]), and we do not discuss it

in details. The UV-divergences (in our case the poles in ǫ in diagrams) of the model con-

sidered are removed by the multiplicative renormalization procedure. It amounts to the

following: the initial action is referred to as nonrenormalized, its parameters and coupling

constants are referred to as bare; these are considered as some functions (remaining to be

determined) of new renormalized parameters and coupling constants. The renormalized

action functional

called ”minimal subtraction scheme”); µ ≃ 1/lp is the renormalization mass parameter,

(36)

Za(g, ǫ, u, d) are the renormalization constants. Due to gauge invariance of the theory
the terms breaking the gauge symmetry are not renormalized, and they do not require

counterterms, [4]. The renormalized correlation functions WR meet the relation

W R(g, u, µ)Z Nφ

φ Z NA

A = W (g0, u0)

in which W R are UV-ﬁnite functions (they are ﬁnite in the limits ǫ → 0) for ﬁxed param-

eters a.

The RG equations are written for the functions W R which diﬀer from the initial W

only by normalization and then can be used equally validly for critical scaling analysis. To

derive these equations one notes that the requirement of eliminating singularities does not

determine the functions e0 = e0(e, ǫ),
is not ﬁxed by any physical condition. Variation of µ for ﬁxed values of bare parameters

e = {g, u, m}, uniquely because of the value of µ

e0 leads to variations of e and renormalization constants (35). Following the standard
notation, we denote by Dµ the diﬀerential operator µDµ for ﬁxed e0. Applying it on both
sides of (32) leads to the basic RG equation, [8]:

[Dµ + βg∂g + βu∂u − γmDm2] W R = 0,

(37)

where we have used Dx ≡ x∂x for any parameters of the renormalized theory; for any Zi

γi ≡ Dµ ln Zi,

βα ≡ Dµα, α ≡ {g, u, },

i ≡ {g, u, ζ, m, φ, A}.

(38)

These identities determine the β-functions of the theory considered,

and the anomalous dimensionalities γi. One calculates the renormalization constants Z1−4
from the diagrams of perturbation theory (these calculations are completely analogous to
the relevant computations in f 4-theory of the critical phenomena theory, [4]) and then,

using (38), γi− and βα-functions. By the way, all γ− and β− functions are constructed
as series in g and u, and the functions γi do not depend on ǫ. Furthermore, the relations
between renormalization constants (35) lead to analogous relations for γα:

γg = γ4 − 2γ1,

γu = −γ2.

(40)

We have computed the relevant renormalization constants up to the second order diagrams

of perturbation theory. These computations are pretty standard, so that we just bring

about the results for γi for the three dimensions,

γ1 =

g′2 + u′2,

γ2 = 6u′2,

γ3 = g′2 + 6u′2,

γ4 = 6g′2 +

Eight ﬁxed points of the RG transformation are determined by the system of equations
βα(g′∗, u′∗) = 0. A ﬁxed point is stable with respect to large-distance asymptotics if the
matrix ωij ≡ ∂iβj is a positively deﬁned matrix at the ﬁxed point. Fixed points and their
stability regions with respect to the large-distance asymptotics are collected in the Tab.

The ﬁxed point N 4 corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the scalar φ4 model

of critical phenomena, [7]. In the model discussed it is unstable due to scalar potential
coupling to the vector potential ﬁeld A. For the ”physical” value of the parameter 2ǫ =

4−d the point N 3 is the only stable ﬁxed point. The ﬁxed point N 7 would be stable close

to the four dimensions also. The large-distance asymptotic behavior of water response

in three dimensions is then governed by the ﬁxed point N 3. The inequality 0 < ǫ < 3

determines the relevant basin of attraction in space dimensionality.

In the framework of RG-approach the physical degrees of freedom are replaced by the

scaling degrees including anomalies. In particular, the scaling functions are obtained in

the form of the power series in g and u. Asymptotically, these coupling constants are

replaced by their values in ﬁxed points of RG-transformation. The critical indices in the

4 − 2ǫ expansion are obtained from the γ−functions (42) with replacement of g and u by
g∗ and u∗ also. By the way, the properties of scaling degrees of freedom (see Tab.1) yield

some qualitative conclusions on the physical properties of the model.

From the data of Tab.1 it follows that for N 3 the scaling degrees of freedom related
to the φ4−coupling vanish (g∗ = 0) in three dimensions. Thus, all diagrams proportional

to g are vanished in the symmetrical phase of (30), however, no one correlation function

becomes trivial. Considering the theory in three dimensions, one can eliminate the scalar
wave mode coupling term gφ4 from the action (30), since in case of m2 > 0 it does not

contribute to the large-distance asymptotics of water response. One can say that three

dimensional dynamics of an inviscid incompressible ﬂuid involved in eddy motion has

somewhat short of physical degrees of freedom to allow the coupling between the diﬀerent

scalar wave modes. N 7 in Tab.1 gives us an evidence that the both coupling mechanism

introduced in (30) are of equal importance in four dimensions.

Choosing the certain ﬁxed point of RG-transformation (i.e., N 3), we neglect all cou-

plings between various wave modes in beneﬁt for the certain one which is responsible

for vorticity conservation (25) in the large-distance limit. This conclusion expresses ex-

actly that additional assertion which we have needed to complete the phenomenological

description of the problem of coupling water to the O(3)−symmetrical perturbation.

5 Solution of RG-Equations. Critical Scaling and

Asymptotics for Pair Correlation Functions

In the present Section we derive the solutions of RG diﬀerential equations (37) for Dφ
and DA. The use of standard dimensional counting supplied by (35) and (42) leads to the
following expressions for the one-dimensional spectra of the theory:

Dφ(s) ≃s→0 s2−d+ηφfφ(s, g, u2, z), DA(s) ≃s→0 s2−d+ηAfA(s, g, u2, z).

(44)

The functions fφ and fA of dimensionless arguments: s = klp, z ≡ m2r1/ν, ηφ = d − 2 + γφ
= d − 2 + ǫ/3, ηA = d − 2 + γA = d − 2 + 2ǫ, and 1/ν = 2 + γm = 2 − 2ǫ meet the
RG-equations of the type (37) which allow to ﬁnd out their scaling asymptotics (s → 0).

Here we note that for ǫr = 1/2 the asymptotics (44) for DA meets the phenomenological
result (11). The spectrum for Dφ cannot be predicted from the bare dimensional counting
and is justiﬁed within the framework of developed RG method. We have pictured these

spectrum out in Fig. 4.

Being the solutions of RG-equations, the functions fφ and fA are to be the arbitrary
functions of the ﬁrst integrals of (37). The number of ﬁrst integrals is one less than the

number of arguments of f in (44), and they can be founded from the system of equations

d¯g
βg(¯g, ¯u)
supplied by some normalization conditions for ¯g and ¯u. We use the standard one,

¯g(s = 1, g, u) = g,

¯u(s = 1, g, u) = u.

At the ﬁxed point N 3 from (45) and (46) one obtains the asymptotic solutions for
fφ(s, g, u2, z) and fA(s, g, u2, m2r1/ν):

fφ(s, g, u) =

6 Short Distance Expansion. On the Possible Cor-

rections to Critical Spectra in the region mr → 0

Generally speaking, the existence of ﬁxed points of RG-transformation does not guarantee

that the critical asymptotics (44) do have place in the real system. As we have mentioned

above, there would be another IR-divergences in the scaling functions Fφ and FA which
are not handled by RG and, in principle, can modify the large-distance asymptotics close

to the region m0 ≪ k. By the way, for m0/k → 0, the critical dimensions are not suﬃcient
to derive a conclusion on the long-range asymptotic behavior. To investigate the model
(30) with m2 > 0 in the region m0 ≪ k in details we use a Short Distance Expansion
method following [8].

The short distance expansions of scaling functions Fφ and FA in (47) and (48) provides

us by an asymptotic relation of the form

F (1, mr) = 1 +

ci(r)m∆[Oi],

(49)

Xi

where ∆[Oi] are the critical dimensions of all possible statistical momenta (the arbitrary
products of ﬁelds and their derivatives averaged with respect to one point) of various

quantities of the theory (30).

In language of the modern critical phenomena theory

such statistical momenta is called as composite operators in analogy with the well-known

objects in quantum-ﬁeld physics.

It is obvious that the RG-predicted spectra (44) are still secure if for all operators

∆[Oi] > 0. The most important contributions into (49) for mr → 0 are those of the
In the framework of ǫ-expansion ∆[O] = dO + O(ǫ), where dO is the
smallest ∆[O].
canonical dimension of O, therefore, if ǫ is small, the canonical dimension dO provides the
major contribution to ∆[O]. That is why, in principle, to justify the scaling laws (44),

one can limit the checking of critical dimensions by the set of operators with minimal

canonical dimension d0. At the leading order we consider the critical dimensions of the
set of scalar quadratic operators with dO = 1: O1 = φ2(x) and O2 = A2(x).

The certain critical dimensions are assigned to some linear combinations of the opera-

tors O1 and O2 which still invariant in process of renormalization. The basis of renormal-
ized composite operators are related to that one of non-renormalized operators through
the renormalization matrix Zik such that Fi = ZikF R
k , [7]. In principle, the calculation of
matrix elements requires the analysis of diverging part of perturbation theory diagrams,

however, the use of gauge symmetry consequences facilitates computations of the elements

Zik substantially. Since O1 is a gauge invariant operator, but O2 is not, the relevant Ward
identities [4] prove the triangle structure for Zik : Z22 = 1, Z21 = 0. One can say that

Critical Behavior...

18

(50)

(51)

(52)

the non-invariant operator O2 does not contribute into scaling degrees of freedom of the
gauge invariant theory, as well as it does not admix to the gauge invariant operator O1 in
process of renormalization.

Furthermore, we need not compute diagrams to determine the element Z11. Acting by
the diﬀerential operation ∂m2 onto the partition functional of renormalized theory (which
is, obviously, ﬁnite with respect to the limit ǫ → 0), we obtain the following ﬁnite object

hZ3φ2i(x),

the ﬁniteness of (50) leads to the relation Z11 = Z −1

3 Zm = Zφ.

In principle, (50) give us enough information to compute the complete set of critical

dimensions of the considered statistical momenta. Since Zik possesses a triangle structure,
exactly the diagonal elements Zkk give the relevant anomalous correction:

Both linear combinations of O1 and O2 which have the deﬁnite scaling dimensions are
also found unambiguously:

γ11 = γφ =

γ22 = 0.

ǫ
3

,

C1 = O1, ∆[O1] = 1 + ǫ
3,
C2 = O1 + aO2, ∆[O2] = dO = 1.

The only reason that we need to compute diagrams of perturbation theory for the element
Z12 is to determine the value of a; this calculation gives a = 2 (this result is exact,i.e., it
still valid for any value of ǫ)

For ǫ > 0 the most important contribution to (49) is provided by C2: ∼ m, and as it is
obvious, this contribution does not alter the scaling laws (44). The result (52) means that

in the region mr → 0 the scaling laws (44) are still secure as the universal characteristics

of the theory.

7

Spectrum of Energy

The proposed model provides a broad spectrum of practical results which can be com-

pared with experimental data. We now compute the one-dimensional spectrum of energy

of the ﬂuid, E(r/lp), versus the dimensionless distance apart from the point of local per-
turbation. As we have shown in the Introduction, the result on this spectrum, in principle,

can be derived from phenomenology, (12). However, the question on justiﬁcation of the

phenomenological result (12) still remains, since the energy of perturbed ﬂuid has two

components,

E(r/lp) ≡

h(∂φ)2i(r/lp) +

hF 2i(r/lp),

(53)

19

which would have dramatically diﬀerent asymptotic behavior in the large-distance limit.

By the way, (53) would provide us an example of description of a conserved integral

2h(∂φ)2i(r/lp) and EA ≡ 1

quantity in terms of scaling degrees of freedom. The spectrum (53) is governed by the
statistical momenta Eφ ≡ 1
2hF 2i(r/lp) of the canonical dimen-
sion dE = d. To determine the relevant critical indices we apply the trick which we have
employed in the previous Section: Acting by the diﬀerential operations m2∂m2, g∂g, and
u∂u onto the partition functional of renormalized theory we obtain the following ﬁnite
objects at the limit ǫ → 0:

hZ3m2φ2i(r/lp),
h[g∂gZ3] m2φ2 + [g∂gZ1] (Eφ + u2φ2A2) + 1
h[u∂uZ3] m2φ2 + [u∂uZ1] Eφ + 1
+ [2Z1 − u∂uZ2] u2φ2A2i(r/lp).

Any linear combination of (54) is again ﬁnite at the limit ǫ → 0, so that by means of

simple arithmetic operations one can derive from (54) the statements on ﬁniteness for

various linear combinations of statistical momenta including Eφ and EA.

Taking into account that the scaling degrees of freedom relevant to scalar wave modes

coupling are vanished in the large-distance limit (i.e., assuming g = 0 in (54)), we obtain

from (54) the combination containing Eφ and EA:

where we have introduced X1 ≡ [u∂uZ1] and X2 ≡ 1

poles in ǫ, and consequently each term in (55) separately is divergent if ǫ → 0. The

meaning of (55) is that all the poles in ǫ are subtracted out in such a way that the linear

combination in (55) has a deﬁnite limit for ǫ → 0.

The linear form (55) has two eigenvectors,

V1 = Eφ + X −1

1 X2EA,

V2 = EA +

X −1

2 X1Eφ,

(56)

such that the poles in ǫ of V1 are subtracted out by those of X1, and the poles in ǫ of V2
are eliminated completely by those in X2. By the way, γV1 = −Dµ ln (u∂uZ1) = −ǫ/3 and
γV2 = −Dµ ln (u∂uZ2) = −2ǫ.

For the real value ǫr = 1/2 the major contribution to the energy spectrum for the
large-distance asymptotics, r/lp ≫ 1, is provided by the combination from (56) of minimal
critical dimension, i.e., V2 with

∆[V2] = d + γV2 = d − 1.

Note, that ∆[V1] = d + γV1 = d − 1/6. Furthermore, for ǫr = 1/2 X −1
2 X1 = 2, and we
have an explicit form for V1 = Eφ + EA. The last step of the computation is to perform
a Fourier transformation of the momentum asymptotics with the index (57) into the real
space {rl−1

which meets the phenomenological result presented in the Introduction.

8 Conclusion

The ﬁnal conclusion is that in contrast with either the statistical theory of waves (Za-

kharov) or the theory of fully developed turbulence (Kolmogorov) the problem of coupling

water to perturbation cannot be solved from phenomenology in principle. The matter is

that the relevant physical system contains too many redundant degrees of freedom. That

is why to ﬁx the statistically stable behavior in the system one needs to add some extra

assumptions on the character of perturbation as well as on the character of wave modes

coupling.

The problem of formulation of physically relevant hypotheses on wave modes coupling

mechanism can be successfully solved by the use of various quantum ﬁeld theory techniques

and RG method in particular. This approach allows, ﬁrst, to integrate over the redundant

physical degrees of freedom, and, second, to investigate the asymptotic properties of

physical systems by means of analysis of their scaling degrees of freedom.

As a result we have formulated the eﬀective action functional which allows to un-

derstand the water response for a local external perturbation as a critical phenomenon.

The critical system of water coupled to perturbation is subject to a ”phase transition”

depending on the certain physical properties of perturbation pulse.

The results on the asymptotic behavior derived from the RG-analysis meet those of

partial results which can be derived from phenomenology.

Generation of small-scale structures in the developed
turbulence

K.P. Zybin, V.A. Sirota, A.S. Ilyin, A.V. Gurevich

Abstract

The Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible liquid is considered in the limit of
inﬁnitely large Reynolds number. It is assumed that the ﬂow instability leads to gener-
ation of steady-state large-scale pulsations. The excitation and evolution of the small-
scale turbulence is investigated. It is shown that the developed small-scale pulsations
are intermittent. The maximal amplitude of the vorticity ﬂuctuations is reached along
the vortex ﬁlaments. Basing on the obtained solution, the pair correlation function in
the limit r → 0 is calculated. It is shown that the function obeys the Kolmogorov law
r2/3.

1 Introduction

In the turbulent ﬂow, in addition to the average velocity of the ﬂow, random velocity pulsa-
tions are excited. These pulsations could be presented as a sum of diﬀerent scales random
movements. The large-scale pulsations with scale L of the same order as the characteristic
parameters of the ﬂow play a leading role (For example, in the tube of radius R the scale is
L ∼ R/5). Large-scale pulsations have the highest amplitudes.

The small-scale pulsations with scales l << L are excited also. They have much smaller
velocity amplitudes, and they could be considered as a ﬁne structure set to the main large-
scale movement. The small-scale pulsations contain only a small part of the whole turbulent
kinetic energy (see Landau, Lifchitz [1], Monin, Yaglom [2]).

If the viscosity of the liquid ν is small enough, and the Reynolds number Ru correspond-
ingly is large, then the spectrum of the small-scale pulsations becomes very wide. This type
of turbulence is called developed. Let λ0 be the maximal scale where the viscosity is still sig-
niﬁcant; then the range of scales λ0 << l << L is called the inertial interval. The pulsations
developed inside the inertial interval in diﬀerent scales are determined by nonlinear processes
only, since the viscosity ν is negligible. Therefore, it is possible to study the inertial interval
of the turbulence in the limit ν → 0 ,

λ0 → 0 , Ru → ∞ (Frisch [3]).

In the turbulent ﬂow velocities are random. So, the correlation functions could be used

to describe them. Let us consider the isotropic turbulence. The pair correlation function

K(r) =

[v(ρ) − v(ρ + r)]2

,

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

determines the relation between the values of velocity in two near points ρ and ρ + r. Since
the turbulent pulsations are isotropic, the correlation function depends on the distance r
between the points only. The pair correlation function measured in numerous experiments
has the universal form:

The distance is restricted by the condition r << L, i.e. the experimental result (1) refers
to the inertial interval only. The Fourier-transform S(k) of the correlation function (1) has
been also investigated experimentally. These investigations give

K(r) = Cr2/3

S(k) = Cf k−5/3,

(1)

(2)

where k is the wave vector. The spectrum (2) is called the ﬁve-thirds law. The limit r → 0
corresponds to k → ∞. In the developed turbulence the ﬁve-thirds law is observed inside a
wide range of wave numbers – up to three-four orders of magnitude [2],[3].

We emphasize that the experimental measurements of the correlation function in the
small-scale region were initiated by the theoretical predictions. A.N. Kolmogorov in his
fundamental works in 1941 [4] derived the expressions (1), (2) for the velocity correlation
function in the homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. 1 The Kolmogorov’s theory is phe-
nomenological.
Its basic conception is the uniform dissipation of energy in the turbulent
liquid. There is a stationary ﬂux of energy in the Fourier space: the energy is generated
in large-scale pulsations, and ﬂows uniformly through the whole inertial interval of scales.
In this process, the ﬂux of the energy is conserved. The dissipation occurs only outside the
inertial interval, at the smallest ”dissipative” scales ≤ λ0. Relaying on this physical model,
using the relations of similarity and dimensions and the general properties of hydrodynamics
equations, the correlation function was found.

This fundamental Kolmogorov’s result was later conﬁrmed in numerous experiments. It
stimulated a huge amount of theoretical, mathematical and (in the recent time) numeri-
cal investigations. In these works the theory of turbulence was widely developed (see the
monographs [2],[3],[6] – [9] and literature therein). Recently, the methods of ﬁeld theory and
solid-state physics have been used [10],[11]. However, the attempts to obtain the expression
for the correlation function directly from the Navier-Stokes equation without any additional
assumptions have not been successful up to now (see [3] for more details).

Another approach to the problem is based on the physical ideas of the leading role of
singularity in the small-scale structures of developed turbulence [3], [13]. However, despite
signiﬁcant eﬀorts in this direction, neither the correlation function has been derived from
the Navier-Stokes equation, nor even the existence of singular solutions has been proved.

Thus, the problem of derivation of the fundamental Kolmogorov’s result directly from

hydrodynamic equations is not solved yet (see the monographs [2],[3]).

In this paper we propose a new approach to the problem. It allows to ﬁnd the structure

of the small-scale turbulence and the pair correlation function.

From the hydrodynamic equations written in the Lagrangian reference frame, we derive
the equation describing the joint probability density of vorticity ω = ∇ × v and its time

1The law (2), which is the direct consequence of (1), was written in an explicit form in the papers by

A.M. Obukhov [5].

derivative. We show that moments of the vorticity distribution grow unrestrictedly in time.
Then we ﬁnd an asymptotic solution at inﬁnitely large time. Basing on it, we obtain the
spatial distribution of the vorticity where it is large. These are vortex ﬁlaments. They give
the main contribution to the pair correlation function.

The paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2 the equations of motion of incompressible liquid are considered. Their
decomposition in the vicinity of trajectory of an arbitrary lagrangian particle is written. It
is shown that local vorticity growth is determined by anisotropic part of large-scale pulsations
of pressure.

In Section 3, supposing the randomness of large-scale pulsations of pressure, the equation
for probability density of vorticity and its time derivative is obtained. We show that even
moments of the vorticity distribution grow exponentially, the higher moments growing faster
than the lower ones. This is the manifestation of intermittency of hydrodynamic turbulence
in small scales.

In Section 4 we ﬁnd the large time asymptotic solution for the joint probability density

of vorticity and its time derivative.

In Section 5, on the ground of the obtained asymptotic solution, the spatial structures
contributing mainly to the asymptote of the probability density are investigated. We show
that these are the vortex ﬁlament structures which determine the pair correlation function
of turbulent pulsations (1) as r → 0.

In Conclusion we formulate and discuss the main results of the paper.

2 The statement of the problem

Let us consider the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible liquid. It is known that at the
scales larger than the viscous scale λ0 it takes the form of the Euler equation:

∂v
∂t

∇p
ρ

+ (v · ∇)v +

= 0 ;

∇ · v = 0

(3)

Here v is the velocity of the ﬂow, p is the pressure. The density ρ is taken unity below. The
second equation expresses the incompressibility of the liquid. The equations (3) describe
the processes on the scales inside the inertial interval (see [3]). From (3) one can ﬁnd the
relation connecting the pressure with the ﬂow velocity:

−∆p = ∇ivj · ∇jvi

To investigate the local properties of the turbulent ﬂow we pass on to a coordinate system

co-moving to some element of the liquid with coordinates ξ(t):

r′ = r − ξ(t) , v′ = v − ˙ξ;

¨ξ = −∇p

r = ξ(t)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Dot means the time derivative. After such change of variables the equations (3) take the
form

+ (v′ · ∇)v′ + ∇P = 0 ,

∇P = ∇p + ¨ξ ,

∇ · v′ = 0

(4)

∂v′
∂t

Since the reference frame is chosen to be co-moving, at the point r = ξ(t) we have

∇P (r′ = 0) = 0 ,

v′(r′ = 0) = 0

Expanding the velocity v′ and the pressure P into a Taylor series in the vicinity of the
co-moving point we have the main term:

(cid:21)

The ﬁrst term in the square brackets is symmetric, the second term is antisymmetric. Since
the equation should hold for any r′, both terms are equal to zero. Actually, multiplying the
expression in the brackets by ǫijn and taking bii = 0 into account, we ﬁnd for xi and bij:

˙bij +

(xixj − x2δij) + bikbkj + ρij = 0

˙xn = bnkxk

¨xn = −ρnkxk

Taking the time derivative of (8), we obtain ﬁnally the equations set for the three components
xi:

Let us clarify now the physical meaning of the symmetric part of velocity bik. Namely,
let us express it in terms of space distribution of the vorticity ω(r). We shall see that in
the completely isotropic ﬂow bij = 0. Hence in accordance with (8), the vorticity at the
lagrangian point does not change. In the real ﬂow there are two regions where the isotropy
may be broken: either local, on account of small-scale pulsations of pressure in the vicinity
of the point under consideration; or global, the remote areas close to the boundary of the
system, at the scales of the order R. We shall show that bij is determined just by the global
break of isotropy.

Since ∇ · v = 0, there exists a vector potential A:

v = ∇ × A , ∇ · A = 0.

4

Then

To separate the singularity accurately, let us expand A(r) and ω(r) into a series on spherical
harmonics:

∆A = −ω.

(10)

The solution of the Poisson equation (10) is:

A =

Alm(r)Ylm(θ, ϕ) ,

ω =

ωlm(r)Ylm(θ, ϕ).

(11)

The integration limits are chosen to provide the convergence of the integrals at r → 0 and
r → ∞. Note that for analytic function ωlm(r) ∝ rl as r → 0.

To evaluate bij, we need to determine the limit ∇kvi = εijn∇k∇jAn as r → 0. Only
quadratic (in the coordinates ri) part of A contributes in it. This quadratic part consists of
two terms proportional to the zeroth A00 and the second A2m spherical harmonics. Hence,
we are interested in the two harmonics only.

The zeroth harmonic A00 gives the local contribution corresponding to the antisymmetric
part of the velocity tensor: x = ω00|r=0 = − ∆A00|r=0. However, in the symmetric tensor
bij its quadratic component A00 ∝ r2 is cancelled:
it is just the fact that gives bij = 0 in
isotropic medium. So, only the second harmonic A2m remains. Since ω2m(r) ∼ r2 as r → 0,
we see that the ﬁrst integral in (11) behaves like r4, and the second one - like r2 as r → 0.
Hence, the contribution of the ”local” item is negligibly small, and the symmetric part of
the velocity tensor bij is determined by ”global”, large-scale properties of the whole ﬂow. 2
Returning to the rectangular coordinates and taking the derivative, we obtain

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

According to our analysis, the integrand has no singularity at r = 0; the integral accumulates
at the scales of the order of R, where the isotropy breaks.

The analogous argumentation shows that the pulsations of pressure ρik (see (7)) could
also be presented as a sum of local and large-scale pulsations; the local part of the tensor
is xixk − δikx2. From (9) it follows that this tensor does not aﬀect the local vorticity of the
ﬂow. Hence, the local dynamics of vorticity (9) depends on the large-scale pulsations of the
pressure ρnk only.

Thus we obtain the ﬁrst main property of the turbulent ﬂow: the local vorticity along the
streamline in homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow is determined by anisotropic part of large-scale
pulsations of the pressure.

2Note that in two-dimensional ﬂow such a division into local and large-scale components is not possible.
The zeroth cylindrical harmonic A0 diverges logarithmically, and as a result the ”local” component should
inﬂuence on the large-scale component.

3 Probability density equation

Since we interested in statistical properties of the ﬂow, let us introduce the probabilistic
description. We consider now the vorticity ω(t) as a random quantity. Its change still obeys
to (9). Instead of one equation of the second order, let us consider a system of two ﬁrst-order
equations:

˙xi = yi

˙yi = −ρijxj

Here xi ≡ ωi and yi ≡ ˙ωi. We introduce a joint probability density

f (t, x, y) =< δ(x − x(t))δ(y − y(t))) > .

Here x(t), y(t) are the solutions of (12) at the given realization of ρij and initial conditions;
the average is taken over the ensemble of all possible realizations.

The aim of the paper is to study a steady-state turbulent ﬂow in the inertial interval of

scales, i.e. at scales l and time t satisfying to the conditions

l << L,

t >> τc

Here L and τc are the characteristic space and time correlation scales of the large-scale
vortices. These large-scale vortices depend on the speciﬁc geometry of the installation and
on the boundary conditions. According to the experimental data [14], the large-scale velocity
pulsations are random and Gaussian. Thus, in the equations (9) or (12) for the local vorticity,
the matrix ρij(t) describing the large-scale ﬂuctuations of pressure could be taken Gaussian
and, because of (14), delta-correlated in time. These propositions would be discussed below.
Note that, as it follows from (9), the ”random” behavior of vorticity (or velocity) is

caused by the randomness of the large-scale ﬂow and the corresponding matrix ρik(t).

The Gaussian random process is described by a pair correlation function

Using (12) and taking time derivative of the probability density function, we obtain

Let R(x, y, ρ) be a functional of ρ. To ﬁnd the correlation function hρkpR(x, y, ρ)i we use
the standard averaging technics for delta-correlated random process (see the monograph by
Klyackin, [15]):

Combining this with (16), we obtain the Fokker-Planck equation for the function f (t, x, y):

(18)

(19)

(20)

The matrix ρij(t) is symmetric (6). Hence, in the homogeneous and isotropic medium the
general form of the matrix Dijkl is

Dijkl = Dδ(t − t′) (δikδjl + δilδjk + Γδijδkl)

The constants D and Γ depend on the large-scale ﬂow.
In addition to the isotropy and
homogeneity, it is natural to suppose statistical independence of diﬀerent components ρik.
In this case one has Γ = 0. However, the values D and Γ appear to be unimportant. The
parameter D in the equation vanishes as a result of time normalization. As we shall see
below, the resulting properties of the turbulence depend only weakly on the parameter Γ
(the positive deﬁniteness leads to a restriction Γ > −2).

Here γ = 1 + Γ, time t is normalized by D1/3. The value D−1/3 is the characteristic time of
probability density change. As it was shown above, in the completely isotropic turbulence
D = 0. Taking into account small anisotropy, we have D−1/3 >> τc. This allows to use the
delta-correlation approximation in derivation of the equation (20).
We now itemize the main properties of the equation (20):
1. All momenta of values xk and yj of the order n are connected by a system of the ﬁrst

order linear diﬀerential equations.

2. Even momenta grow exponentially. Independently of the initial conditions, the func-
tion f at large values t depends on the modules x, y and the cosine of the angle between the
vectors µ = (x, y)/xy only.

3. The higher even momenta grow faster than the lower ones.
To illustrate these statements, consider the momenta of the second and the fourth order.

Integrating the equation (20) in x and in y, we obtain for the second-order momenta:

< xixj >=< xiyj + xjyi >

< xiyj + xjyi >= 2 < yiyj >

Let us consider the invariant momenta of the second order, i.e. < x2 > , < y2 > and
< x · y >. Their evolution is determined by characteristic equation

Asymptotically as t → ∞ we obtain

λ3 − 4Γ − 16 = 0.

< x2 >∝< y2 >∝< x · y >∝ exp(Λ2t)

Here Λ2 = (16 + 4Γ)1/3.

For the other momenta (i 6= j) one has

λ3
2 = 4 + 4Γ

We see that Λ2 > λ2. Hence, at large time the invariant momenta are much larger than
the others. In other words, the probability density function at large time depends on three
variables x, y, µ = xiyi/(xy) only.

The characteristic equation for invariant momenta of the fourth order takes the form:

λ6 − (84Γ + 244)λ3 − 1280 = 0.

For example, for < x4 > one has < x4 >∝ exp(Λ4t), where

Λ4 =

h(cid:0)

(cid:1)

One can check up that for the values Γ > −0.9 holds Λ4 > 2Λ2. Hence, as t → ∞ one has
< x4 >≫< x2 >2.

The obtained relations demonstrate that the higher momenta of the vorticity module
grow exponentially in time. This property is called intermittency.
It reveals itself in the
instability of small-scale ﬂow. Physically this instability means that under the inﬂuence of
large-scale random pulsations a drop of incompressible liquid stretches out. This leads to
generation of vortex ﬁlaments. These ﬁlaments provide the basis of the small-scale turbulence
(a simple physical example demonstrating the process of ﬁlament growing is considered in
Appendix).

It will be shown later that the domain of parameters y ≫ x plays an especially important
role. In this domain the suggestion of gaussian random process is not needed. Actually, from
(12) it follows that the change of y during the correlation time is ∆y ∼ x. Hence,

∆y

if

y ≫ x

(22)

In this case the ﬂuctuations of the probability function are very small: δf ≪< f >, and one
can obtain the equation (20) using the perturbation theory. As a result, the equation has
the Fokker-Planck form.

4 Asymptotic form of the probability density function

As it was shown in the previous section, the probability density function (20) at large time
depends on three variables only: f (x, y) = f (x, y, µ), where µ = (x, y)/xy. Besides, the
equation (20) and the initial conditions to the probability function allows integrating over
three other variables.

The function f must satisfy the normalization condition

and two conditions of zero ﬂux from the boundaries x = 0 and y = 0. Let us specify the
meaning of these conditions. For that we return to the equation (20). It has the divergent
form ∂f /∂t = ∇αJα , α = 1..6. The ﬂux density Jα in a 6-dimensional space (x, y) is

We now return to (23). We search for a stationary solution as t → ∞. Choosing a new

f (x, y, µ) =

We have found the general solution. Let us now check the boundary conditions (24),
(25). The solution w2 gives F0 ∼ z−1/3 as z → 0. The correspondent
∂y dµ does not
vanish as y → 0. This contradicts to the boundary condition (24). Hence, the solution of
our problem is w1, since it satisﬁes (24).

The Kummer functions behave like M(a, b, z) ∼ ezza−b as z → ∞ if a is not negative
integer. Therefore, for the corresponding values α = 4 − 3a and for small x we have F (z) ∼
z−α/3, f x2 ∼ y−α. This means that the no-ﬂux condition on the boundary x = 0 (25) is
not satisﬁed. Hence, to satisfy both boundary conditions (24) and (25) one should take the
solution w1 with the values α that correspond to ”discrete” spectrum 5

For these values α the series M contains a ﬁnite number of terms, the leading term being

The solution (32) together with (33) and (31) gives asymptotic behavior of the function
f as t → ∞. We stress that, according to (26), (33), the full probability density function
f (x, y, µ) in the leading asymptotic term behaves like

as x → ∞. Below, we will need integrability of the function F only.

5 Spatial distribution of vorticity. Singularity of vor-

ticity and pair correlation function.

In the previous section we found an asymptotic solution for probability distribution of ω,
˙ω.
It is important that the solution has power fall as x → ∞. This means a signiﬁcant prob-
ability of large-amplitude ﬂuctuations of |ω|. This is the manifestation of intermittency in
the turbulence: in some spatial domains the value |ω| is much larger than its average. The
question is how the ﬂow in this domains should look like to provide the obtained asymptote.
For this purpose, let us deﬁne the probability density function for the module of vorticity

based on the combined probability density of ω,

˙ω (13),(20):

P (x, t) =

f (t, x, y)x2dydµ = hδ(x − |x(t)|)i

Z

On the other hand, we independently deﬁne a probability density P1(x, t) as space average
of some realization of the turbulent ﬂow:

P1(x, t) =

δ(x − X(t, r))dr.

1
V

Z

Here X(t, r) = |ω(t, r)| is the vorticity module at time t and at the point r, V is the volume
of space occupied by the ﬂow.

The ﬁrst expression for the probability density P (x, t) is the ensemble average along a
trajectory of liquid particle ξ(t), and the second expression for P1(x, t) is the space average.

Owing to ergodicity (i.e. the equality of ensemble and space averages) we obtain

P (x, t) = P1(x, t)

If the function P (x, t) is known, then it is possible to derive space distribution of the
vorticity module X(t, r) using (36) and (35). Since we are interested in possible singularities
and their surrounding, let us consider the limit t → ∞ and next x → ∞.

Suppose that the singularity is reached at some surface. Taking the point of origin on

the surface and the axis z perpendicular to it, we ﬁnd

Here dσ is the element of the surface area. The simplest example of surface where the
vorticity grows unrestrictedly large is the tangential break of ﬂow velocity. Indeed, in the
case the velocity is V0 on one side of the contact surface and −V0 on the other side. Hence,
the vorticity is concentrated on the surface.

Let us now consider the most interesting case: the maximum of X(t, r) is reached along
a vortex line. Then, choosing the cylindrical variables z, r, φ with z axis oriented along the
line, we obtain

P1(x, t) =

δ (x − X(t, r)) rdrdφdz =

In the case of point-like maximum, using spherical coordinates r, θ, φ, we would obtain

P1(x, t) =

δ (x − X(t, r)) r2dr sin θdθdφ =

(cid:11)

Here v⊥ is the velocity component perpendicular to the current line ξ(t). According to the
deﬁnition (4), the expression v⊥(r, t) − v⊥(0, t) is identically equal to ω × r in the vicinity
of the vorticity’s singularity. Hence, as r → 0 we get

Since the direction of the line is arbitrary, the turbulent pulsations change it. From the
isotropy it naturally follows that the space average over the main scale of the turbulence is
equivalent to the average over the angles. The expression (42) then transforms to

K(r⊥) ∝ ω2r2

⊥ ∝ r2/3
⊥

K(r) ∝ r2/3

(42)

(43)

So, the main expression (1), (43) follows naturally from our consideration. It means that
Kolmogorov’s correlation function (43) is determined by the system of vortex ﬁlaments. The
input of regular part of the velocity to the correlation function (∝ r2) is negligible.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we investigated the small-scale structure generation in the developed turbu-
lence. Here we summarize and discuss brieﬂy the main results.

1. Vortex structures
We considered the Navier-Stokes equation as ν → 0. We derived the equations describing
the growth of small-scale pulsations along the Lagrangian trajectory under the action of the
large-scale turbulence. We showed that the small-scale part of vorticity grew exponentially in
time. This growth led to formation of a system of ﬁlaments and surfaces where the vorticity
grew intensively. We derived the characteristic parameters of the vortex structure growth in
time.

2. Singularity
We showed that in the non-dissipative limit ν → 0 the absolute value of the vorticity ω
tended to inﬁnity along the vortex ﬁlaments as t → ∞. Notice that constructing the proba-
bility density function (20) we linearized the hydrodynamic equations near the Lagrangian
trajectory (9). We obtained the exponential growth of vorticity which may be cut either by
nonlinear corrections or by viscosity of the ﬂow. Let us discuss now the nonlinear correc-
tions. The feedback eﬀect of the small-scale pulsations could be estimated by comparison of
the energy density of small-scale pulsations with the energy of large-scale ones. The energy
density of the main pulsations on the scale L is

E0 =

ρU 2

1
2

here U is the velocity of the large-scale pulsations. From (39) we estimate the velocity of
the ﬁlament having width r0: vn ∼ U (r0/L)1/3. Taking into account the part of volume
occupied by the ﬁlaments, we obtain the relation between the energy densities:

Here Nf is the ratio of the number of ﬁlaments to the number of large-scale vortex in the
volume unit.

Thus, we see that the feedback eﬀect of small-scale pulsations on the large-scale ones
is insigniﬁcant. Hence, the singularity should be cut oﬀ by viscosity. The situation is
quite analogous to that in supersonic hydrodynamics: the singularities (strong and weak
discontinuities) in Euler ﬂow are cut oﬀ by viscosity.

3. Correlation function
We found the solution of the equation describing the vorticity distribution in the vicinity
of the vortex ﬁlaments. The solution had the form |v⊥| ∝ r1/3
⊥ in the plane perpendicular to
the vortex ﬁlament. This was the solution that determined the form of the pair correlation
function in small scales. Thus, we found the velocity correlation function (1), (43) in the
steady-state turbulent ﬂow directly from the Navier-Stokes equation in non-viscous limit
ν → 0.

4. Intermittency
According to the Kolmogorov-Richardson assumption the energy ﬂux in turbulent ﬂow
cascades from larger scales to smaller ones and dissipates at the smallest scales uniformly in
space and time. Landau pointed out that this assumption was controversial (see [3] §6.4).
Gurvich in 1960 [18], and later the other researchers discovered experimentally a very strong
time and space inhomogeneity of velocity and energy ﬂux. This property of turbulence is
called intermittency. Variety of approaches to this eﬀect was considered by many authors
(see monographs [2],[3] and citations therein).

Let us list the intermittency features that follow from the presented theory.
1) The vorticity distribution in space is very inhomogeneous. Near the vortex axis it

could possess the value many times exceeding its average.

2) Even moments of the correlation functions should grow with number of the moment.
3) The energy dissipation in the developed turbulent ﬂow is localized near the axes of
vortex ﬁlaments and the vortex surfaces. It is distributed very inhomogeneously in space
and time due to the vortex structures motion. Besides, the strong nonuniform dissipation is
the most pronounced manifestation of the intermittency [19].

Note that the ﬁlaments give the maximum degree of singularity as t → ∞ and are respon-
sible for the form of the pair correlation function. However, the surface-type singularities
may aﬀect the dissipation process, since they could occupy a signiﬁcant part of the volume
of the ﬂow.

We see that volume conserves. For example, if b > 0 then the cylinder stretches, and its
transversal radius decreases.

Combining (A.5) with (A.1) – (A.4), we obtain a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations:

˙a + a2 − ω2 = −P1

˙ω + 2aω = 0

(A.7)

˙b + b2 = −P2

16

Note that the system allows one arbitrary function of time. Actually, with account of
(A.6) we have four equations and ﬁve unknown functions: a , b , ω , P1 , P2. Without loss of
generality one can choose P2(t) as such arbitrary function. We also note that the change
of vorticity ω(t) is connected unambiguously with change of the ”cylinder length” Z(t):
ω(t) = ω0Z(t)/Z0.

Diﬀerentiating the second equation of the system (A.7) and substituting other equations,

we get

¨ω = −P2(t) ω

This equation is a particular case of (9). We assume that P2(t) is rather complicated ”ran-
dom” function and its time average is zero. Then the time intervals when P2(t) > 0 and
P2(t) < 0 are equally probable. However, at P2(t) > 0 the function ω(t) oscillates, the
oscillation amplitude changing weakly. To the contrary, at P2(t) < 0 the function ω(t)
grows exponentially. It is clear that in the average the value ω grows. Since ω and Z are
proportional, such growth means ”stretching out” the cylinder.

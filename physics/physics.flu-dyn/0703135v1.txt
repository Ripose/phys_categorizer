Optimizing the Source Distribution in Fluid Mixing

Jean-Luc Thiﬀeault∗ and G. A. Pavliotis†

Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom

A passive scalar is advected by a velocity ﬁeld, with a nonuniform spatial source that
maintains concentration inhomogeneities. For example, the scalar could be temperature with
a source consisting of hot and cold spots, such that the mean temperature is constant. Which
source distributions are best mixed by this velocity ﬁeld? This question has a straightforward
yet rich answer that is relevant to real mixing problems. We use a multiscale measure of
steady-state mixing eﬃciency and optimize it by a variational approach. We then solve
the resulting Euler–Lagrange equation for a perturbed uniform ﬂow and for simple cellular
ﬂows. The optimal source distributions have many broad features that are as expected: they
avoid stagnation points, favor regions of fast ﬂow, and their contours are aligned such that
the ﬂow blows hot spots onto cold and vice versa. However, the detailed structure varies
widely with diﬀusivity and other problem parameters. Though these are model problems,
the optimization procedure is simple enough to be adapted to more complex situations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Consider a passive scalar advected by a velocity ﬁeld, in the presence of an inhomogeneous spa-
tial source. An obvious question is, which velocity ﬁelds are best at homogenizing the concentration
ﬁeld? This is a challenging question, and here we turn it around into a less obvious one: given a
velocity ﬁeld, which source distributions are best mixed by this ﬁeld? For example, in a room with
a given airﬂow, where to best position heating units to achieve a homogeneous temperature? We
will see that answering this type of question gives considerable insight into optimal stirring ﬂows
in general.

To carry out the optimization we need to narrow the problem further. First, we ﬁx the ampli-
tude of the velocity ﬁeld, such as by specifying its total energy (in a bounded domain) or energy
density (in an unbounded domain). Second, we restrict the source and velocity ﬁelds to be time-
independent, so that the problem is steady. Finally, and most importantly, we need to specify how
we measure the eﬃciency of the stirring process. Here we use a generalization of the variance of
the concentration ﬁeld, which has long been a popular measure of mixing. The reasoning is that
a velocity ﬁeld that is eﬃcient at stirring should suppress ﬂuctuations in the concentration ﬁeld,
and the variance decreases as these ﬂuctuations become smaller.

Previous work on optimization of mixing has focused on breaking ﬂow symmetries [1–4], or
optimizing quantities associated with chaotic advection, such as Lyapunov exponents or topological
entropy [5–10]. Recent work has also involved optimizing the norm of the concentration ﬁeld [11,
12], in a manner similar to here. However, all these approaches diﬀer from our work in that they
do not involve body sources of scalar continually replenishing the variance of the concentration
ﬁeld. The optimal solution we ﬁnd are quite diﬀerent, especially in that they do not tend to lead
to creation of small spatial scales in the concentration ﬁeld, but rather magnify the importance of
eﬃcient transport of temperature from sources to sinks.

Motivated by Doering and Thiﬀeault [13] and Shaw et al. [14], we introduce a one–parameter

and diﬀusivity, but in the absence of stirring. The eﬃciency thus tells us how much better the
velocity ﬁeld is at suppressing ﬂuctuations than if we didn’t stir at all.1 The above deﬁnition
is appropriate for the steady advection–diﬀusion problem that we consider in this paper. The
relevant deﬁnition for the time-dependent problem is given in Doering and Thiﬀeault [13], and
involves taking the long-time average of the numerator and denominator in (1). As mentioned
above, for simplicity we shall restrict our study to time-independent ﬂows and sources, though
the more general formulation is not conceptually more complicated. We assume without loss of
generality that the source and initial condition, and consequently the scalar concentration, have
spatial-mean zero. For concreteness, we will often refer to θ as ‘temperature’ or ‘heat’, and speak
of ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ regions, but the considerations here apply to any passive scalar.

For p = 0, the mixing eﬃciency (1) involves the scalar variance and was introduced by Thiﬀeault
et al. [15]. Varying p preferentially weighs the smaller (p > 0) or larger (p < 0) scales, providing a
diﬀerent measure of mixing eﬃciency. This mixing eﬃciency was used by Doering and Thiﬀeault
[13] and Shaw et al. [14] in the context of statistically-steady turbulent ﬂows, and they found that
the scaling of the eﬃciency with the energy of the velocity ﬁeld depends strongly on the nature of
the source. For p =

1, the mixing eﬃciency is closely related to the mix-norm [11, 12].

In this paper we maximize (1) using a variational approach (Section II). The variation leads
to an Euler–Lagrange equation where the leading eigenvalue is the optimal eﬃciency, with the
corresponding eigenfunction giving the optimal source distribution. Some salient features of the
optimal solutions are that (i) the optimal source avoids having hot or cold spots over stagnation
points of the ﬂow; (ii) regions of high velocity are favored; and (iii) the hot and cold spots are
positioned such that the ﬂow sweeps hot onto cold and vice versa. Though most solutions have
these broad features, they diﬀer considerably in their details and often change dramatically (but
continuously) as parameters, such as the diﬀusivity or the exponent p in (1), are varied.

We illustrate the range of solutions by considering ﬁrst the simplest situation, that of a uniform
velocity ﬁeld, as discussed in Plasting and Young [16], Doering and Thiﬀeault [13], and Shaw et al.
In that case the optimization problem can be solved analytically (Section III). We then
[14].
impose a perturbation to the uniform ﬂow, leading to either a shear ﬂow or a wavy ﬂow, and solve
for the optimal source using perturbation theory. The resulting optimal sources favor regions of
high velocity in the shear ﬂow, but the wavy ﬂow leaves the optimal solution unchanged from the
uniform ﬂow, and only decreases its eﬃciency. This shows, unsurprisingly, that it is still possible
to improve the eﬃciency after optimizing the source by optimizing the velocity ﬁeld.

We then move to direct numerical solution of the optimization problem for a simple cellular
ﬂow (Section IV). The basic problem turns out to be doubly-degenerate in that there are two
independent source distributions that give the same optimal eﬃciency. This is a consequence of a
symmetry of the ﬂow, and we verify that breaking this symmetry by adding a small perturbation
to the velocity ﬁeld selects a unique optimal solution. We also use the cellular ﬂow to study
the range of behavior as the diﬀusivity and the exponent p in (1) are varied. In all these cases,
the optimal source distribution converges at extreme parameter values (large or small diﬀusivity

). For all the cases, we also compare the optimized eﬃciency to two simple reference
or p
sources, sin x and cos x. Because of the phase of the rolls, the cos x is much more eﬃcient that sin x,
and its eﬃciency is very close to optimal. This is not in itself a drawback, since it shows that our
deﬁnition of eﬃciency is fairly robust to changes in the source, a desirable feature for practical
implementation. Finally, we oﬀer some concluding remarks in Section V.

We consider the time-independent advection–diﬀusion equation

in [0, L]d with periodic boundary conditions. The (given) velocity ﬁeld u(x) is incompressible,
u = 0. Both u(x) and s(x) are assumed to be suﬃciently smooth. We assume that the source
∇ ·
and initial condition have spatial mean zero, which implies that the scalar concentration also has
mean zero. We remark that the solution T (x, t) of the evolution problem

, to the solution θ(x) of the steady problem (2), the convergence
converges, in the limit t

problem (2).

Before considering speciﬁc examples in Sections III and IV, let us demonstrate that the optimal

III. UNIFORM FLOW WITH PERTURBATION

As a ﬁrst test case for the optimization procedure of Section II, we consider a uniform ﬂow
(constant magnitude and direction in space). The uniform ﬂow illustrates a fundamental mech-
anism involved in source optimization, as mentioned in Plasting and Young [16] and Shaw et al.
[14]: the velocity ﬁeld sweeps the hot source onto the cold sink, and vice versa. More generally, we
expect that the optimal source will tend to have contours perpendicular to the ﬂow. The uniform
ﬂow maximizes the mixing eﬃciency for a one-dimensional source, at ﬁxed kinetic energy.

To capture another important feature of optimal sources, in Section III B we perturb the uniform
ﬂow to make either a shear ﬂow or a wavy ﬂow. The shear ﬂow perturbation will show that optimal
sources are localized over rapid regions of the ﬂow. The wavy ﬂow perturbation will show that
sometimes aligning the source contours perpendicular to the ﬂow is too ‘costly’, and the optimal
solution is left unchanged from the uniform ﬂow. The cost incurred is due to the weighing of the
mixing eﬃciency (1) by the purely-diﬀusive solution: a change in the source might make it more
eﬃcient, but it can also make the purely-diﬀusive solution more eﬃcient, yielding no net gain.

Note that in this section we will restrict our optimization to the variance, that is with p = 0 in

the mixing eﬃciency (1). We shall return to the eﬀect of varying p in Section IV C.

For completeness, in this short section we essentially rederive the results of Plasting and Young
[16], Doering and Thiﬀeault [13], and Shaw et al. [14] on the optimality of a uniform ﬂow. We
start with a uniform ﬂow on [0, L]2,

u1(x, y) = u1x(y) ˆex + u1y(x) ˆey ,

which are simple to analyze but yield important insight. Because the base ﬂow is in the ˆex direction,
the u1x(y)ˆex term is a shear ﬂow perturbation, and the u1y(x)ˆey term is a wavy ﬂow perturbation.
Our goal is to obtain an asymptotic expansion for the optimal source and eﬃciency. For this we
need to study perturbatively the eigenvalue problem (9), which we write as

Some observations regarding (21) are in order. First, notice that a nonzero u1x (shear ﬂow
perturbation) increases the eﬃciency, while a nonzero u1y (wavy ﬂow) decreases it. Second, the
form of u1y is irrelevant, and it does not aﬀect the ﬁrst-order optimal source distribution. Third,
in the limit of large κ (small Pe), the Pe−2 term in (21), arising from κ2∆2 in A0, invalidates the
expansion. We discuss each type of perturbation in turn.

Figure 1(a) shows the optimal source distribution for U = 1, L = 2π, κ = 0.01 (Pe = 100),
ˆu1x = 1/√2, k1 = 2, ε = 0.15, u1y = 0. This is a shear ﬂow, with contour lines shown in
the background. The contour lines are closer together at the midpoint, indicating faster ﬂow,
since the perturbation is u1x(y) = √2 cos 2y. Accordingly, the optimal source is localized at
these points of faster ﬂow. However, there is a limit to how localized it can get:
if the source
were to bunch up too much in the faster region, the purely-diﬀusive solution would be more
eﬀective (i.e., have lower variance), reducing the eﬃciency. As the perturbation gets larger, the
optimal source will bunch up more in the faster regions, since the gain becomes greater. The
eﬃciency is always greater than in the unperturbed case, suggesting that the advantage of faster
ﬂow regions outweighs the disadvantage of localizing the source. Finally, note that for large α
(large perturbation wavenumber k1), the mixing eﬃciency becomes independent of α, reﬂecting
the fact that making the a ﬁne-scale perturbation is overwhelmed by diﬀusion.

Conversely, Figure 1(b) shows the optimal source distribution for the same parameters as the
shear ﬂow above but with perturbation u1y = √2 cos 2x, u1x = 0. The streamlines in the back-
ground indicate that this is a wavy ﬂow, with no dependence on y. The optimal source distribution,
again shown in the background (here as cos x, but the phase is arbitrary), is exactly the same as
in the absence of perturbation. Intuitively, one could expect the source to be more eﬃcient if it
tilted to present its contours perpendicular to the ﬂow, giving a wavy source. This is not the case,
since the purely-diﬀusive solution would be more eﬀective for a wavy source, and thus lower the
eﬃciency since it enters the denominator in the deﬁnition (1). Localizing the source in regions of
faster ﬂow (as for the perturbation in Fig. 1) is a more important eﬀect than aligning the contours
of the source perpendicular to the ﬂow.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE CELLULAR FLOW

In Section III we derived expressions for optimal sources and mixing eﬃciencies for perturbations
of a uniform ﬂow. More general velocity ﬁelds require a numerical approach. To maximize the
eﬃciency, we again have to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem (8) for the optimal source
distribution s. For numerical implementation, it is preferable to solve the equivalent self-adjoint
eigenvalue problem

for the eigenvector r, which then yields the optimal source distribution s. The advantage of the
form (22) is that the self-adjoint structure of the operator is explicit. In practice, we expand r as a

The Abelian group G has order 8 and is characterized by G4
2 = I, G1G2 = G2G1.2 For
either δ1 or δ2 nonzero, the perturbations break the symmetry G1 of the cellular ﬂow, and we shall
look at their eﬀect in turn.

1 = G2

First we set δ1 = δ2 = 0 in (23) and solve (22) with κ = 0.01.

In this case, there are two
independent optimal source eigenfunctions with degenerate eﬃciency E = 87.34, shown in Fig. 2. In
the foreground are contour lines of the streamfunction. Any superposition of the two eigenfunctions
in Fig. 2 will give the same eﬃciency. The degeneracy is a consequence of the symmetry G1
of the cellular ﬂow:
indeed, the two eigenfunctions are related to each other (up to a sign) by
the transformation (24a). The two eigenfunctions also separately have the G2 symmetry. This
situation, where the eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue are related by a unitary
representation of the symmetry group of an operator, is familiar from quantum mechanics [17, 18].
For comparison, the eﬃciency for the same ﬂow but with the reference source s(x) = sin x
is 50.01, and with the reference source cos x is 86.61. Hence, for sin x the optimal source gives
a 74.7% improvement in the eﬃciency, but only 0.9% for cos x. It is remarkable how close cos x
comes to the optimal eﬃciency, which shows that the optimal source is rather ‘robust’, so that
small changes in its shape do not lead to huge changes in the eﬃciency. From a design standpoint,
this is highly desirable. Table I summarizes the optimal eﬃciency results for diﬀerent values of the
perturbations δ1 and δ2.

2 G is the direct product of a cyclic group of order 4 and a cyclic group of order 2.

How to interpret the optimal source distribution in Fig. 2? The lesson learned from the uniform
ﬂow of Section III is that, ideally, the source should be such that the velocity ﬁeld advects heat
from hot to cold and vice versa. This is clearly happening in Fig. 2 to some extent, since in both
eigenfunctions the hot and cold spots are situated such that the rolls easily advect heat between
hot and cold. However, this is not the whole story: the optimal source is also distributed so as
to take advantage of regions of faster ﬂow. This is readily apparent in Fig. 3, which shows the
magnitude of the velocity ﬁeld in the background, and contours of the optimal source distribution
from Fig. 2 (right). The hot and cold spots (elliptic regions) are clearly localized over the regions
of rapid ﬂow (pale background). Some of the fast regions appear to have no hot or cold spots, but
these regions are favored in the other eigenfunction, so the symmetry is respected.

Next, we resolve the degeneracy of the optimal source distribution by setting δ1 = 0.05 in (23)
while keeping δ2 = 0, giving the streamfunction shown as contour lines in the foreground of
Fig. 4(a). The rolls now have a slight asymmetry that breaks the rotational symmetry G1 of
the unperturbed cellular ﬂow. As a consequence, the normalized optimal eigenfunction is now
unique, and is shown as the shaded background in Fig. 4(a). It is very close to the degenerate
0. The eﬃciency in this case is
eigenfunction on the right in Fig. 2, and converges to is as δ1 →
almost unchanged, 87.59. Again, the cosine reference source has much higher eﬃciency (86.18, 1.6%
improvement for the optimal source) than the sine reference source (49.76, 76.0% improvement for
the optimal source).

Finally, we set δ1 = 0 and δ2 = 0.05 in (23), with the streamfunction shown as contours in the
foreground of Fig. 4(b). As for the previous perturbation, this one also breaks the G1 symmetry
and causes the optimal eigenfunction to become unique, but this time a superposition of the two
degenerate eigenfunctions in Fig. 2 is selected. The optimal eﬃciency, 90.10, is again almost
unchanged by this small perturbation.

To summarize this section, we presented three cases at ﬁxed diﬀusivity κ = 0.01. The ﬁrst was
the cellular ﬂow, for which we get doubly-degenerate optimal eigenfunctions. We then presented
two symmetry-breaking perturbations in turn, showing how these select a particular mixture of the
degenerate eigenfunctions to create a unique optimal source distribution. Since the perturbations
are small, the optimal eﬃciency in all these cases is about the same, showing an improvement of
about 75–80% over the reference source sin x, but only 1–5% over the reference source cos x. This
latter modest improvement is best seen not as a failure of the optimization procedure, but as an

advantage, since robustness is always desirable. In fact robustness can easily be gauged by looking
at the magnitude of the next largest eigenvalues, to see how far they are from the dominant one(s).
Table I also shows that the modest improvement over the cosine source is an accident, since for
many other velocity ﬁelds improvements well above 50% are seen for both sine and cosine. Two
further examples for large perturbations are shown in Figs. 4(d) and 4(c).

B. Dependence on Diﬀusivity

Now we will ﬁx δ1 = δ2 = 0 in (23) and vary the diﬀusivity, κ. For κ = 0.01, Fig. 2 shows
the two degenerate optimal source eigenfunctions, and we will follow the change in the one on the
left as κ is varied. In Fig. 5 we show the change in the optimal source as κ is increased from 0.1
to 100. The optimal source distribution appears to become independent of κ both for small κ and
large κ, but the distributions are diﬀerent. The transition between the two regimes occurs when κ
is of order unity. Though the two asymptotic sources are very diﬀerent, they respect the general
principles laid out in Section IV A: the source is arranged for eﬀective transport of hot onto cold
and vice versa, and regions of high speed are favored. In particular, note that the center of the
rolls has a nearly zero, ﬂat source distribution in all cases.

Another perhaps surprising aspect of the large κ solution in Fig. 5 is that it has complicated

to be smoothed out. But since our mixing eﬃciency (1) compares the variance to the unstirred
case, which already has very low variance, any amount of improvement will count. Hence, the
complicated source for large κ in Fig. 5 only gives a minute improvement to the eﬃciency. The
large κ optimal solution is particular in that it has some hot and cold spots localized over hyperbolic

even at the cost of straddling hyperbolic stagnation points a little.

Figure 6 shows how the mixing eﬃciency varies as a function of the diﬀusivity. The solid line is
for the optimal source, the dashed lines for the reference sources sin x and cos x. For small κ, the
eﬃciency of all sources scales as κ−1: this is the ‘classical’ scaling discussed in [13–15], where the
eﬃciency is linear in the P´eclet number. It has been rigorously proved in [13–15] that this scaling
is optimal over all possible sources and velocity ﬁelds.

For κ near unity, the optimal eﬃciency has a small dip before converging towards unity as κ−1
for large κ. In contrast, the reference eﬃciencies converges to unity as κ−2. This last scaling holds

FIG. 5: For the same ﬂow as in Fig. 2, optimal source distribution for diﬀerent values of the diﬀusivity κ,
increasing from top left to bottom right. The eigenfunction is doubly-degenerate and corresponds to the one
on the left in Fig. 2. For both small and large κ the optimal source converges to an invariant eigenfunction.
In all cases there is no source of temperature over the elliptic stagnation points, but in the large κ case there

for the uniform ﬂow of Section III when expanded in large κ, and is veriﬁed for other ﬂows and
sources as well [13–15].

In summary, the optimal source distribution becomes independent of κ for both large and small
κ, but of course for large κ the eﬃciency gain is minimal (since the L2–norm of the velocity is ﬁxed).
For small κ the eﬃciency gain is a constant multiple of the reference sources, but this multiple is
fairly small for cos x (1.01), showing that optimization is very robust but not necessarily always
worthwhile. Overall, the optimal eﬃciency scales as κ−1, with a momentary break in the scaling
that corresponds to the complicated change in topology seen in Fig. 5 for κ near unity.

C. Dependence on Exponent p

Our ﬁnal study will be to examine the behavior of the optimal eﬃciency as p is varied in (1).
In Sections IV A–IV B we used p = 0; now we ﬁx δ1 = δ2 = 0, κ = 0.01, and allow p to vary
over negative and positive values. Figure 7 shows the optimal source distributions for p varying
from
1 to 2. For both negative and positive p, the optimal source distribution converges rapidly to
invariant patterns, and the two extremes in Fig. 7 are representative of those asymptotic patterns.

the reference source solution approaches unity as κ−2.

The situation is thus entirely analogous to the case where diﬀusivity was varied (Fig. 5).

The top-left picture in Fig. 7 (negative p) shows small, localized sources and sinks. In contrast,
the bottom-right picture in Fig. 7 (positive p) shows large, regular localized sources and sinks. In
fact, what is striking about the pattern is its simplicity: it is what one might take as a guess at
an eﬃcient source distribution, with no added frills. Thus, a high power of p might be useful in
situations where a simple, eﬃcient conﬁguration is desired, such as in engineering applications.
The reason for the simplicity is that spatial variations in the source favor the diﬀusion operator
in L, and as p
these are magniﬁed. Thus, the source must remain as spatially simple as
possible while trying to maximize alignment with the velocity. As p
, spatial variations of the
source are downplayed by the norm, allowing more complexity.

FIG. 7: For the same ﬂow as in Fig. 2, optimal source distribution for diﬀerent exponents p, increasing from
top left to bottom right. The eigenfunction is doubly-degenerate and corresponds to the one on the left in
Fig. 2. For both small and large p the optimal source converges to an invariant eigenfunction. In all cases
there are no sources or sinks of temperature over the stagnation points. (See the caption to Fig. 1 for a key
to the background shading.)

2. Localization over regions of rapid ﬂow;

3. Alignment of the source contours perpendicular to the local velocity, so that hot is swept

onto cold and vice versa.

For a shear ﬂow perturbation (Section III B), the optimal source bulges out over regions of faster
ﬂow.
In contrast, a wavy ﬂow perturbation leaves the optimal source unchanged over from a
uniform ﬂow, suggesting that localization is a more important eﬀect than alignment. This also
demonstrates that the optimal solution for source optimization does not necessarily correspond to
the optimal solution for velocity optimization, given that optimal source. This is because at ﬁxed
energy the wavy ﬂow always decreases the optimal eﬃciency from that of the uniform ﬂow, for the
same source distribution.

These considerations show that the mixing eﬃciency and optimization procedure described in
this paper (Section II) behave in a natural manner. Furthermore, the procedure yields a global
maximum (Section II B), is numerically well-behaved, and is easy to implement. Indeed, a three-
dimensional application to a real system is well within the realm of feasibility.

The optimal source distribution becomes independent of the diﬀusivity κ for both large and
small κ (Section IV B), and for exponent p [see Eq. (1)] negative and large or positive and large
(Section IV C). None of the source distributions achieved in these cases resemble each other.

However, we observed that the eigenvalue spectrum of (7) is always symmetric about p = 1 (and
has a minimum there), which implies that the operators (and thus the optimal source distributions)
are related by a unitary transformation we were unable to ﬁnd in general (but see Appendix A
for a partial result). The large positive p case is particularly interesting, since it favors source
distributions that are very smooth, a desirable feature in practical applications. Another attractive
feature we observed is the robustness of the optimal solution in the cases considered (Section IV A),
but this will not necessarily hold in general.

To widen the applicability of the procedure, a few complications will have to be introduced.
First, time-dependence of the ﬂow and the source is desirable, which will make the variational more
diﬃcult to solve in principle. Second, and more importantly, there remain the much more diﬃcult
problem of optimizing the velocity ﬁeld given a source distribution. The variational problem is
easily formulated, but does not present itself in the nice generalized eigenvalue problem [Eq. (7)] we
saw here. The third and ultimate goal is a full dynamical coupling to the Navier–Stokes equation,
with buoyancy and other eﬀects included as appropriate.

Throughout the paper we spoke of ‘mixing’ because our description involves the interplay of
stirring and molecular diﬀusion. However, we highlighted the more interesting limit of small
diﬀusivity κ (large P´eclet), since this is the situation in which stirring is more pertinent. In that
case, it is clear that the pushing of hot ﬂuid onto cold regions and vice versa is better described
as ‘transport’ rather than ‘mixing’. Thus, perhaps in that limit we should speak of a ‘transport
eﬃciency’, but since our analysis applies even for very large κ we have kept the terminology, in
spite of the fact that the velocity ﬁelds presented here do not lead to creation of small scales and
thus may not ‘mix’ very well by some criteria.

APPENDIX A: SYMMETRY OF OPTIMAL MIXING EFFICIENCY ABOUT p = 1

In this appendix we will motivate the symmetry of the optimal eﬃciency curve about p = 1, as

evident in Fig. 8. We use the self-adjoint form (22): let

Bp[u] :=

A−1/2

p Ap[u]

A−1/2

where we have explicitly shown the dependence of the operators on u(x). We show below that

with P−1 = P. Since the spectrum is unchanged by the substitution u(x)

lishing (A1) proves that B2−p[u] and Bp[u] have the same spectrum, which explains the symmetry
of the eﬃciency about p = 1. The eigenfunctions are related by a parity change. Unfortunately,
Eq. (A1) is only an asymptotic result valid for large κ, and we do not know the general form of
the symmetry P for smaller κ, though numerical evidence suggests it exists.

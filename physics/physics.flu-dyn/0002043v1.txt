Abstract

This work is devoted to the study of the decay of multiscale deterministic solutions

of the unforced Burgers’ equation in the limit of vanishing viscosity.

It is well known that Burgers turbulence with a power law energy spectrum E0(k) ∼
|k|n has a self-similar regime of evolution. For n < 1 this regime is characterised by
an integral scale L(t) ∼ t2/(3+n), which increases with the time due to the multiple
mergings of the shocks, and therefore, the energy of a random wave decays more slowly
than the energy of a periodic signal.

In this paper a deterministic model of turbulence-like evolution is considered. We
construct the initial perturbation as a piecewise linear analog of the Weierstrass func-
tion. The wavenumbers of this function form a ”Weierstrass spectrum”, which ac-
cumulates at the origin in geometric progression. ”Reverse” sawtooth functions with
negative initial slope are used in this series as basic functions, while their amplitudes
are chosen by the condition that the distribution of energy over exponential intervals
of wavenumbers is the same as for the continuous spectrum in Burgers turbulence.
Combining these two ideas allows us to obtain an exact analytical solution for the

1

velocity ﬁeld. We also notice that such multiscale waves may be constructed for mul-
tidimensional Burgers’ equation.

This solution has scaling exponent h = −(1 + n)/2 and its evolution in time is self-
similar with logarithmic periodicity and with the same average law L(t) as for Burgers
turbulence. Shocklines form self-similar regular tree-like structures. This model also
describes important properties of the Burgers turbulence such as the self-preservation
of the evolution of large scale structures in the presence of small scales perturbations.

The nonlinear diﬀusion equation

(1.1)

was originally introduced by J.M.Burgers in [6] (1939) as a model for hydrodynamical tur-
bulence. Burgers’ equation (1.1) describes two fundamental eﬀects characteristic of any
turbulence [10]: the nonlinear redistribution of energy over the spectrum and the action
of viscosity in small scales. Burgers’ equation was used later to describe a large class of
physical systems in which the nonlinearity is fairly weak (quadratic) and the dispersion is
negligible compared to the linear damping [29]. The most important example of such waves
are acoustical waves with ﬁnite amplitude [24]. Another class of problems, arising, e.g., in
surface growth, also leads to Burgers’ equation [5],[8],[30]. The three dimensional form of
(1.1) has been used in cosmology to describe the formation of large scale structures of the
Universe at a nonlinear stage of gravitational instability ( see e.g. [15], [25], [13], [28] ).

In the physically important case of large Reynolds number, the action of viscosity is
signiﬁcant only in the small regions with high gradient of the velocity ﬁeld. In the limit
ν → 0, the solution of Burgers’ equation has the following form (see [18], [7], [13]):

v(x, t) =

x − y(x, t)

where y(x, t) is the coordinate of the maximum of the function

G(x, y, t) = Ψ0(y) −

, v0(x) = −

∂x

.

(1.2)

(1.3)

Strong interaction between coherent harmonics leads to the appearance of local self-
similar structures in Burgers’ equation. A periodic initial perturbation with zero mean
velocity is transformed asymptotically into a sawtooth wave with gradient ∂xv = 1/t and
with the same period l0. It is important that at this stage the amplitude a(t) = l0/t and
the energy density σ2(t) ≃ l2

0/12t2 do not depend on the initial amplitude.

2

An initial one-signed pulse with the area m > 0, localised at t = 0 in the neighbourhood
of the point x = 0, also has asymptotically a universal form: it transforms into a triangular
pulse with the gradient ∂xv = 1/t and increasing coordinate of the shock xs ≈ (2mt)1/2. Due
to the increase of the integral scale the amplitude of such a pulse a(t) = xs(t)/t ∼ m1/2t−1/2
and its energy will decrease more slowly than for a periodic signal, like t−1/2.
Continuous random initial ﬁelds are also transformed into sequences of regions with the
same gradient ∂xv = 1/t, but with random locations of the shocks separating them. Due
to the multiple merging of the shocks the statistical properties of such random ﬁelds are
also self-similar and may be characterised by the integral scale of the turbulence L(t). The
merging of the shocks leads to an increase of the integral scale L(t), and because of this the
energy

of a random wave decreases more slowly than the energy of periodic signals.

σ2(t) ∼ L2(t)/t2

(1.4)

The type of turbulence evolution is determined by the behaviour of the large scale part

of the initial energy spectrum

E0(k) =

Here
b0(k) is a function which falls oﬀ rapidly for k > k0 ∼ l0, and b0(0) = 1. For
n > 1 the law of enrgy decay strongly depends on the statistical properties of the initial
ﬁeld (see e.g. [30] and references therein). For the initial Gaussian perturbation the integral
scale L(t) ∼ t1/2 times logarithmic correction obtains and is determined by two integral
characteristics of the initial spectrum: the variances of the initial potential Ψ0 and the
velocity v0(x) [20],[9],[13],[16].

For n < 1 the structure function of the initial potential increases as a power law in space.
Then the initial potential ﬁeld is Brownian, or fractional Brownian motion, and some scaling
may be used [7],[20], [13], [26], [3],[22], [23]. In this case the turbulence is also self-similar
and the integral scale L(t) increases as

The energy of the turbulence is derived from (1.4):

L(t) = (αt)2/(3+n).

σ2(t) ∼ t−p, p =

2(n + 1)

n + 3

.

(1.7)

(1.8)

The diﬀerence between these two cases ( n < 1 and n > 1 ) is connected to the process of
parametric generation of low frequency component of the spectrum. For the case n < 1 the
newly generated low frequency components are relatively small and we have the conservation
of large scale part of the spectrum:

E(k, t) = E0(k) = α2kn, f or k << 1/L(t).

(1.9)

Thus, the laws of turbulent decay are more complex than for simple signals, which can
be attributed to multiple merging of the shocks. In [12] a model of a regular fractal signal

3

with decay lower than for single one-signed pulse was introduced. The initial signal v0(x)
was constructed as a sequence of one-signed pulses whose positions form a Cantor set with
capacity (fractal dimension) D = ln N/ ln β, where N p is the number of pulses in the scale
Lp ≃ L1Nβp−1, 0 < D < 1. Multiple merging makes the decay of the wave slower and
the general behaviour of the energy decay may be approximated by the power law with the
exponent in (1.8):

p =

,

0 < p < 1.

(1.10)

1 − D
2 − D

The evolution proves to be self-similar in successive time periods (ti, ti−1) and (ti+1, ti+2),
where ti+1/ti = β2/N. This shows log-periodical self-similarity of the ﬁeld evolution. Linear
and non-linear decay of fractal and spiral ﬁelds given by the sequences of regular pulses was
also investigated in [1]. It was shown that the power law (1.8) with the exponent given by
the formula (1.10) holds also true for homogeneous fractal pulse signal with capacity D.

Another model of a multiscale signal, which has the same general behaviour on the
external scale L(t) (1.7), and energy of the Burgers turbulence, was also discussed in [12]. It
was assumed therein that the initial signal is a discrete set of modes - the spatial harmonics

v0(x) =

∞

Xp=0

ap sin(kpx + ϕp),

(1.11)

with wavenumbers kp and amplitudes ap given in terms of a parameter ǫ by

kp = k0ǫp,

ap = a0ǫ−hp,

h = −(

n + 1

2

), a0 = αk(n+1)/2

0

.

(1.12)

Amplitudes ap and the scaling exponent h are chosen from the condition that the mean
energy of harmonics in the interval ∆p = kp − kp+1 be identical to that corresponding to the
spectral density (1.5): a2
p = E(kp)∆p. For ǫ << 1 and n > −1 the harmonics are spread
over the spatial spectrum and accumulate at the point k = 0 with decreasing amplitude.
The main approach in this model was that the energy of the wave is the sum of energies of
independent modes. The approach is nontrivial, but nevertheless leads to the same laws of
the integral scale L(t) (1.7) and the energy decay (1.8) as in the case of continuous spectrum
(1.5). Let us point out that representation of the ﬁeld given by the formula (1.11) is similar
to shell models, which were introduced as useful models addressing the problem of analogous
scaling in fully developed turbulence (see, e.g., [11], [19] and references in there).

In present paper we consider the evolution of a regular signal whose behaviour in general
is similar to the evolution of the Burgers turbulence with continuous spectrum (1.5). The
main diﬀerence,as compared to the model discussed above, is that we construct the exact
solution of Burgers’ equation using as an initial mode the ”reverse” sawtooth wave. The
frequency ratio in our model is ǫ = 1/N, where N is an integer and N ≥ 2. These perturba-
tion are similar to the well known Weierstrass and Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal functions
(see [21], [4]).

For the analysis of Burgers’ equation it is convenient to use a mechanical interpretation.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the solution of Burgers’ equation and the

4

dynamic of a gas of inelastically interacting particles [13], [14]. Let us take a one-dimensional
particle ﬂux with a contact interaction: as long as the particles do not run into each other
they move with constant velocity.
In the collision they stick together, forming a delta-
function singularity in the matter density. This leads to the appearance of gas of two
species: a hydrodynamical ﬂux of the ”light” initial particles, and a gas of ”heavy” particles
arising in the adhesion process of light particles. The evolution of the particle velocity ﬁeld
will be described by the solution of Burgers’ equation if we assume that the initial density
of the light particles is ρ0 = const, the velocity of particles is equal to the initial velocity
in (1.1), and that the collision of the particles conserve their mass and momentum. This
analogy permits construction of a very fast (linear time) algorithm of solution of Burgers’
equation [27].

In our case, for the initial reverse sawtooth wave, all the matter turns into heavy particles
at the same moment of time. Thus, after this time the evolution of the Burgers turbulence
is fully determined by the motion of heavy particles, whose positions are positions of shocks,
and masses are equal to ∆v · t, where ∆v are the amplitudes of the shocks.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the evolution and interac-
tion of “reverse” sawtooth modes. In section 3 we consider the interaction of small scale
mode with large scale structures. In Section 4 we investigate the properties of the sawtooth
Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function. In section 5 we show that deterministic model has
logarithmic periodic self-similarity. We also discuss here the multi-dimensional generaliza-
tion of this model. Section 5 presents concluding remarks.

2 Evolution and interaction of ”reverse” sawtooth modes

in Burgers’ equation

Let us introduce the pth ”reverse” saw tooth mode as

v(p)(x, 0) = apA(kpx + ϕp)

(2.1)

Here ap, kp are amplitude and wavenumber of the mode, −ϕp is its phase. The function
A(x) is 2π periodic function, given on its ﬁrst period by the following expression

A(x) = π − x,

x ∈ [0, 2π[

(2.2)

The set of ”reverse sawtooth” functions is not orthogonal, but nevertheless we will introduce
a set of modes satisfying equation (1.12), whose wavenumbers and amplitudes satisfy the
same relations as the sinusoidal modes of [12], i.e. relation (1.11). We introduce the term
”reverse sawtooth” because this signal is a sawtooth with teeth facing to the right, but the
term ”sawtooth” by itself is widely used in Burgers turbulence literature to refer to the late
stage of the evolution of the wave proﬁle a sequence of sawteeth with positive slope 1/t.

The solution of Burgers’ equation with a linear velocity proﬁle v0 = −γ(x − x+) is

well-known (see, e.g., [13]):

v(x, t) = −γ(x − x+)

1 − γt

5

(2.3)

The value γ−1 has the dimension of time, and for γ > 0, at the ﬁnite time t = γ−1 the
gradient ∂xv becames inﬁnite. For γ < 0 the gradient becomes equal to ∂xv = t−1,
independent of the value of γ at times t ≫ |γ|−1. Thus, we have from (1.12), (2.1),(2.2),
that the evolution of the pth mode is characterised by the nonlinear time

tp = γ−1

p = apkp

−1 = t0/(ǫ(n+3)/2)p,

t0 = 1/αkn+3/2

0

(2.4)

Based on solution (2.3 ) it is easy to see that for the ”ﬁrst” period (if ϕp = 0) the evolution
of the pth reverse mode at the initial stage (t < tp) may be described as

v(p)(x, t) = 

On the other hand, at time t = tp, the mode transforms into a ”direct” sawtooth wave with
slope ∂xv = 1/t , independent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode:

v(p)(x, t) = ( x/t,
(x − π

kp

)/t,

if 0 < x < π
;

(2.6)

The density of energy σ2(t) = hv2(x, t)iL, where hiL denotes averaging over the period, is
conserved before t < tp, and decreases like (kpt)−2 after t > tp.
Consider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution
of the pth mode. In the general case, the density of the gas is calculated by using the Jacobian
of the transformation from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates and may be written in the
form ( see, e.g., [13] )

Then it is obvious that at the initial stage

ρ(x, t) = ρ0(1 − t∂xv(x, t))

ρ(x, t) = ρ0

equal to the zero positions of the initial pth mode. The process of light merging particles
and the evolution of the velocity is shown in Fig.1.

6

Consider now the joint evolution of two successive modes: pth and (p + 1)th. From (2.4)

one can see that the ratio of nonlinear times of the successive modes is

tp+1
tp

= ǫ−(n+3)/2 ≡ ǫ1−h,

(2.11)

which does not depend on p and increases if the exponent n is greater than −3. The gradient
of the initial ﬁeld v(p)(x) + v(p+1)(x)
is −(γp + γp+1), so the eﬀective nonlinear time for
such a sum is

tp,ef f = tp,p+1 =

tp

,

(2.12)

1

=

γp + γp+1

1 + tp/tp+1

Because all parts of the initial perturbation have the same slope, all light particles will collide
at the same time t = tp,p+1.

The mass of heavy particles after merging are mp,i = ρ0∆i,i+1, where ∆i,i+1 is the distance
between adjacent shocks in the initial perturbation. The ratio of periods of two adjacent
modes is Lp+1/Lp = kp/kp+1 = ǫ−1. If N = ǫ−1 is an integer larger than 1, there will be
N + 1 heavy particles on the period of the larger scale mode (p + 1)th:
(N − 1) with the
mass mp = ρ0Lp (2.9), and two particles with total mass equal to mp. These two particles
only exist when the shock of the (p + 1)th mode is located in the interval between shocks of
the pth mode. For simplicity, we will consider the case where the spatial relations

kp+1ϕp+1 = kpϕp + 2πr/N,

(2.13)

between the phases of successive modes, hold. In this case the discontinuities of the (p+1)th
mode do not produce new shocks in the total perturbation v(p)(x)+v(p+1)(x). Thus, at times
t larger than t > tr,ef f , the masses of all heavy particles will be the same, as would be the
case without the large scale modes (2.9).

The positions of these heavy particles at time t = tp,ef f are

X(p,l)(tp,ef f ) = xp,l + v(p+1)(xp,l)tp,ef f ,

(2.14)

where xp,l are the zero positions of the pth mode (2.10). The velocity of this particle is equal
to v(p+1)(xp,l). Equation (2.14) is obvious if we use the trivial equality v(p)(xp,l)+v(p+1)(xp,l) =
v(p+1)(xp,l), and also note that the position of the heavy particle xp,l(tp,ef f ) is equal to the
position at the same time of all light particles with initial coordinate x = xp,l. From (2.14)
we immediately have that after time tp,ef f the positions of the particles are

X(p,l)(t) = x(p,l) + v(p+1)(xp,l)t.

(2.15)

The diﬀerence between the coordinates of the adjacent particles Xp,l(t) and Xp,l+1(t) de-
creases with time, proportionally to the gradient of v(p+1)(x):

X(p,l+1)(t) − Xp,l(t) = (xp,l+1 − xp,l) − t

∂v(p+1)(x)

∂x

(xp,l+1 − xp,l) ≡

(xp,l+1 − xp,l)(1 − t/tp+1).

(2.16)

7

These particles collide at time t = tp+1 (2.4) and the newly created heavy particles will

have masses

m(p+1) = ρ0Lp+1

and positions

π
kp+1 −
The velocity of these particles is zero.

l = 0,±1,±2, ...

(2.17)

(2.18)

Thus, at times t larger then tp+1, the evolution of the initial perturbation v0(x) = v(p)(x)+
v(p+1)(x) will be the same as the evolution of only the large scale mode v(p+1)(x). The process
of particles merging and the evolution of the velocity for the sum of two successive modes
with the periods ratio N = 2 are shown in Fig. 2.

By recurrence, it is evident that for ﬁnite number of modes v(x) = v(p)(x) + v(p+1)(x) +
... + v(M )(x) the evolution of the ﬁeld after tM will be the same as the evolution of only
the largest mode v(M )(x). The reason for this, is of course, the special relation between
the phases ϕp and the wavenumbers kp of all interacting modes: kp = k0/N p ( see equation
(1.12) ). For integer N the minimal value of any combination of these wavenumbers is
equal to the largest mode wavenumber kM = k0/N M . So the nonlinear interaction does not
produce new components at frequencies less than kM .

3 Interaction of small scale ”reverse” sawtooth mode

with large scale structures

Let us now consider the interaction of the pth mode with an inﬁnite series of larger scale
modes

(3.1)

assuming that the phases of the modes satisfy the relations ( 2.13 ) and that kr = k0ǫr, ar =
a0ǫ−hr, h = −(n + 1)/2. From (3.1) and (2.4) we have for the gradient of the initial
perturbation v0(x) = vp(x) + Wp(x)

the condition n > −3 (h < 1) being necessary for the series to converge. From (3.2), we

with the original tp determined by the equation (2.4).

),

(3.3)

Thus, after the time of collision ˜tp, heavy particles with mass mp = ρ0Lp (3.2) appear.

The coordinates of these particles will be determined by an equation similar to (2.15)

xp,l(t) = xp,l(t) + Wp(xp,l)t,

(3.4)

with the velocity of particles determined by the function Wp(x) (see 3.1), which is a sum of
all larger modes, and xp,l are the coordinates of the zeros of the pth modes. The diﬀerence
between the coordinates of adjacent particles xp,l and xp,l will then decrease with time like
(1 − t/˜tp+1), where ˜tp+1 = tp+1(1 − ǫ(n+3)/2) is the inverse of the gradient of the function
Wp(x), see (3.1) and (3.2). Thus, the time of particle collision for this generation will be
described by equation (3.3) with p = p + 1, and the new masses will be determined by the
period of the (p + 1)th mode - see equation (2.17).

The extrapolation of this particle merging process to the next generations is evident by
recurrence. The qth collision of heavy particles takes place at time ˜tp+q = tp+q(1 − ǫ n+3
2 ),
the masses of these particles at this time are determined by the period of the (p + q)th mode
mp+q = ρ0Lp+q = 2πρ0/kp+q (2.9), (2.17). In the time interval t ∈ [˜tp+q, ˜tp+q+1],

˜tp+q+1
˜tp+q

= ǫ−

(n+3)

2 = N

n+3

2 ;

(3.5)

the coordinates of particles will be determined by the equation (3.4) with p = p + q. Here
Wp+q(x) is the sum of the velocities of all larger modes with r > p + q, and xp+q,l are the
zeros of (p + q)-th mode. It is important to note that at time t > ˜tp+q the evolution of the
particles is solely determined by the modes with r ≥ p + q. It means, that at times t > ˜tp+q
the position of the particles does not depend on the presence in the initial condition of the
small scale modes with r < p + q.

Thus, two processes with diﬀerent initial velocities: ˜v0(x), the ﬁeld with small scales,

and v0(x), the ﬁeld without small scales modes:

v0(x) = Wp+q−1(x); ˜v0(x) = Wp−1(x)

(3.6)

will have the same evolution after t > ˜tp+q−1. Even if p → −∞ (when modes with very
small scales Lp ∼ ǫ−p = N p and very large amplitudes ap ∼ a0(ǫ(n+1)/2)p = a0(N (n+1)/2)−p)
are present in the initial perturbation) the multiple merging of the particles will lead to the
independence of the evolution of large scale modes with respect to the small scale modes.

This eﬀect is similar to the self–preservation of large scale structures in Burgers turbu-
lence [2],[17]. When the initial ﬁeld v0(x) is noise, the highly nonlinear structures contin-
uously interact and due to the merging of shocks, their characteristic scale L(t) constantly
increases. The presence of small scale noise perturbation vh(x) results in additional ﬂuc-
tuations in the shock coordinates ∆xk(t), and these ﬂuctuations increase in strength with
the passage of time. Thus, the ﬁnal result of the evolution of the ﬁeld is determined by the
competition of two factors, the increase in the external scale L(t) of the structures and the
increase in the strength ∆xk(t) of shock coordinates ﬂuctuations, the later being related to
the perturbation vh(x). In a turbulence, having power index n < 1 (1.5), multiple merging
of shocks leads to self-preservation of the large scale structures independently of the presence

9

of small scale components. For the model signal this eﬀect appears for arbitrary n due to
the special choice of wavenumbers and phases of interacting modes.

It was stressed in the introduction that the solution of Burgers’ equation has a one-to-one
correspondence with the dynamics of the gas of inelastically interacting particles ([13]). The
stage when all light particles collide, forming heavy particles, corresponds to the solution
of Burgers’ equation with a well-deﬁned slope ∂xv = 1/t.
In this case the proﬁle of the
ﬁeld v(x, t) is fully determined by the coordinates and amplitudes of the shocks. Their
coordinates Xs(t) are equal to the coordinates of heavy particles, their velocity

= (vs(xs − 0, t) + vs(xs + 0, t))/2
is equal to the velocity of the particles, and the amplitude of the shock

vs(t) =

dXs(t)

dt

(3.7)

(3.8)

∆vs(x) = (v(xs − 0, t) − v(xs + 0, t)) = m/t
is determined by the mass of the particle (ρ0 ≡ 1) (see, e.g., [13]).
properties of the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) of Burgers’ equation.

Thus, the investigation of the motion of heavy particles permits to fully reconstruct the

It was shown in the previous section that the evolution of the particles (shocks) is deter-
mined by the function Wp(x) (3.1). The basis functions of Wp(x) are the reverse sawtooth
periodic functions with wavenumbers kr = k0ǫr and amplitudes ar = a0ǫ−hr, h = −(n + 1)/2
satisfy relations (1.12). Wavenumbers form a geometrical progression like in the Weier-
strass function (see [4]) and accumulate at the origin k = 0. In the original Weierstrass
function, the situation was the opposite with increasing frequencies, but nevertheless the
function Wp(x) has many properties of Weierstrass function and of its generalisation – the
Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function (see [21], [4]).

We consider here a deterministic function Wp(x) with the special phase relation ϕp =
(2πk/N)p
(k = 1, 2, ..., N; N = 1/ǫ ), thus, the discontinuities in the largest modes
r > p + 1 coincide with some of the discontinuities of the smaller mode r = p + 1. The
function Wp(x) is continuous in the intervals 2π/kp+1 = 2π/(k0ǫp+1) with the same slope in
each interval. The inverse value of this slope ˜tp+1

˜tp+1 = tp+1(1 − ǫ

2 );

tp+1 = t0(ǫ

2 )p+1

(4.1)

is proportional to the nonlinear time tp+1 of the smallest mode. Of course, we need n > −3,
so that the convergence of (3.2) is assured and the inequalities tp+1 > tp hold. The amplitudes
of the modes are proportional to ǫ(n+1)/2 and for n > −1 the function Wp(x) is bounded

Thus, for ﬁnite p the energy of Wp(x) is also ﬁnite. For the case of the phase relation
introduced above, the functions Wp(x) also have scaling properties, so that for instance for
k = 0, we have

Wp(x) = ǫ−hpW0(ǫpx); Wp(ǫmx) = ǫhmWm+p(x).

(4.3)
The case −1 < n < 1 is similar to the initial conditions with generalized white noise
in Burgers turbulence. The energy of the initial signal in such turbulence is determined by
the largest cutoﬀ wavenumber, so in our model by the smallest scale p. If p → −∞ the
energy of the model signal (as the energy of white noise) will tend to inﬁnity. But from
the considerations in the previous section we have that at the ﬁnite time t all the modes
p/t2 due to the nonlinear dissipation, so that the whole
with tp < t have ﬁnite energy ∼ L2
energy of the turbulence is also ﬁnite. Thus, even in the case of ”divergent” initial conditions
(p → −∞), we will have a ”convergent” solution for any time t > 0.
The case n < −1 is similar to having fractional Brownian motion initial condition in
In this case, the series (4.2) diverges and the initial signal Wp(x) is
Burgers turbulence.
unbounded. But for Burgers turbulence ( for the process of particles motion and colli-
sions ) only relative velocity of the particles matters. So we can use the same regularisation
procedure with Wp(x). Such a procedure was done with the Weierstrass function in [21].

In our case, taking ϕp ≡ 0, we can introduce the function W ∞

p (x) = Wp(x) − Wp(0),
according to [21], which is ﬁnite in all ﬁnite spatial intervals. The other way to get a bounded
function is to use special phase relations for the modes.

5 Self-similarity properties of deterministic model in

one and two dimension

Here we summarise the properties of the evolution of the multiscale deterministic signal using
some additional information about scaling characteristics of Wp(x), and compare them with
the properties of the Burgers turbulence.

Let us consider the evolution of the multiscale signal

v0(x) = vp(x) + Wp(x).

(˜tp+1/˜tp = N

It was shown that at times t for which t > ˜tp, heavy particles with mass Mp = ρ0Lp appear
and their coordinates are determined by the relation (3.5). These particles collide at time
˜tp+1,
, N = ǫ−1), and new particles with masses mp+1 = ρ0Lp+1 = mpN
appear. Their motion will be determined by the same law (3.5) with substitution p → p + 1.
Using the scaling properties of Wp(x) (4.3) we have, that the motion of the particles in this
interval will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval [˜tp, ˜tp+1] if we rescale
the time t/˜tp ⇒ t/˜tp+1. Since the ratio tp+1/tp does not depend on p, one can speak about
the logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the motion of the particles. This means that at
arbitrary interval [˜tq, ˜tq+1] the motion of the particles will be similar to the motion of the
particles in the interval ˜tp, ˜tp+1, by the scaling factor xp/xq = ǫp−q in space, and the scaling

With each collision, the mass M(t) of the particles increases N = 1/ǫ times. The time

(5.2)

we obtain the same result as for the Burgers turbulence. In our case, m is proportional to
the period of the smallest mode at time t, and is analogous to the integral scale in Burgers
turbulence.

In the case n > −1 we can also estimate the energy decay of the model signal. For
n > −1 and ǫ ≪ 1 the main energy of the signal at time t is in the smallest mode and is
proportional to L2(t)/t2. Thus, we have here again the same law for the energy decay as for
Burgers turbulence.

The numerical simulation based on the algorithm [27] was done to illustrate the process of
particles merging and velocity ﬁeld evolution. The trajectories of the particles and proﬁle of
the ﬁeld at diﬀerent times are plotted for the initial ”white noise” signal (n = 0, h = −1/2)
in Fig.3, and for the initial ”Brownian” motion (n = −2, h = 1/2) in Fig.4. Ten modes with
the ratio of successive wavenumbers ǫ = 1/N = 1/2 were used. The plots show the initial
stage of the evolution in some relatively small region where the ﬁniteness of the number of
modes is not signiﬁcant.

In Fig. 3 one can see that for n = 0 the initial ”sawtooth” multiscale function oscillates
near v = 0 like a ”white noise” with ﬁnite variance. After the collision of light particles,
when the reverse sawtooth function transforms into a sawtooth wave with positive gradient
∂xv = 1/t, the structure of the signal is relatively simple, and even for N = 2 the main
energy remains in the mode with smallest wavenumber.

In the case n = −2 the initial proﬁle has a large deviation behaviour which is typical for
Brownian motion functions. After merging of light particles, the sawtooth proﬁle has a set
of small shocks with diﬀerent amplitudes, which is also similar to the properties of Brownian
signal in the Burgers turbulence [28].

In Figs. 3(c) and 4(c) the velocity ﬁeld at three successive merger times t∗/t∗∗ = N (n+3)/2
are plotted. These ﬁgures show the logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the evolution of
multiscale signals.

We notice now that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional
Burgers’ equation. Let us assume that the initial vector ﬁeld Vp (x) is an inﬁnite series of
”reverse” modes vr (x):

Vp (x) =

vr (x) ,

∞

Xr=p

(5.3)

In the two dimensional case, the rth ”reverse” mode may be composed of piecewise linear
functions deﬁned on a system of regular triangles of size Lr covering the plane. We consider
here the special case when the ratio of the scales of two adjacent modes is Lr+1/Lr = ǫ−1 =
N = 2. We assume also the special symmetry and phase relation between the diﬀerent
modes.
In our case one big triangle is divided into four smaller triangles with vertices

12

located at midpoints of its sides ( see Fig.5 ). We assume that inside each triangle in the rth
mode the velocity has a linear proﬁle vr (x) = −γr (x − x+), where x+ is the coordinate of
the center of the triangle. The solution of the multidimensional Burgers equation for such
initial perturbation

v (x, t) = −γ (x − x+)

1 − γt

(5.4)

is now valid inside the triangle of size Lr(t) = Lr(1− tγr) . The value γ−1
of time, and at the ﬁnite time tr = γ−1

the velocity gradient becomes inﬁnite.

r

r has the dimension

On the other hand, at time t = tr, the mode transforms into a ”direct” sawtooth wave
with the universal behaviour inside the new set of triangles and with the gradient 1/t inde-
pendent of the amplitude and wavenumber of the mode:

v (x, t) =

x − xc

t

,

(5.5)

where xc is now the center of the triangle, coinciding with the top of the initial triangular set.
Consider now the evolution of a gas of sticky particles in the case of independent evolution
of the rth mode. Then, it is obvious that at the initial stage, inside the ”collapsing” triangle
of size Lr(t) = Lr(1 − tγr) the density increases as
1

(5.6)

ρ(x, t) = ρ0

(1 − t/tp)2 ,

while ρ is zero outside ”collapsing” triangular in each cell. At time t = tr, all the light
particles in each cell collide into a single heavy particle with mass

mr = ρ0L2

r√3/4,

(5.7)

and the heavy particles’ positions are equal to the center of the initial triangle x+.

We assume also that the evolution of the rth mode is characterised by a nonlinear time

tr the same as in the one dimension case (2.4):

tr = γ−1

r = t0/(2−(n+3)/2)r.

(5.8)

Let us now consider the evolution of the vector ﬁeld Vp (x) (5.3) which is an inﬁnite
series of ”reverse” modes. The evolution of the vector ﬁeld is very similar to the evolution
of the scalar ﬁeld (3.1). For the gradient of the initial perturbation Vp (x) we have the same
relation (3.2) as in 1D. The eﬀective time of nonlinearity of the smallest pth mode in the
vector ﬁeld (5.3), in presence of all large scale modes, is determined by the equation (3.3).
Thus, after the time of collision ˜tp, heavy particles with mass mp (5.7) appear. Velocities of
these particles will be determined by the function Vp+1 (x) (5.3), which is a sum of all larger
modes, but the number of particle collisions is determined by the next p + 1 mode. At time
˜tp+1 we have a collision of four heavy particles.

The extrapolation of this particle merger process to next generations is evident by recur-
rence. The qth collision of heavy particles takes place at time ˜tp+q), (5.8) the masses of these
p+q√3/4
particles at this time are determined by the scale of the (p + q)th mode mp+q = ρ0L2

13

(5.7). Here also one can speak about the logarithmic periodic self-similarity of the motion
of the particles. This means that at arbitrary interval [˜tq, ˜tq+1] the motion of the particles
will be similar to the motion of the particles in the interval ˜tp, ˜tp+1, by the scaling factor
xp/xq = 2(q−p) in space, and the scaling function tp/tq = (2 n+3

2 )(p−q) in time.

We used computer simulation for studying two dimensional case; results of the simulation
were generated in so called VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language), which enables to
handle three dimensional ﬁgure in diﬀerent projections. Fig. 6 presents snapshots of this
modeling. On the Fig. 6(a) one can see that particles formed by small triangles move towards
the center of an embracing triangle; this center in its turn, moves towards the center of the
next bigger triangle in the hierarchy; e.t.c. Fig.6(b) gives the side-view of this process.

6 Conclusion

In conclusion, we would like to point out that the evolution of the multiscale signal with
the Weierstrass spectrum simulates properties of Burgers turbulence such as self-similarity,
conservation of large scale structures and has the same laws of the energy decay and integral
scale. The diﬀerence between the deterministic model and Burgers turbulence is that here
we have the exact solution for the evolution of multiscale signals and these properties are not
stochastic but deterministic. The evolution of the multiscale signal is exactly self-similar in
logarithmically spaced time intervals. The evolution of the large scale modes is completely
independent of the small scales modes, even if these have very large amplitudes.

These properties take place for Burgers turbulence in the stochastical sense and, more-
over, for a signal with cutoﬀ frequencies of small scales, only asymptotically. Of course, these
properties of the multiscale signal are determined by the special form of modes (reverse saw-
tooth function), the special relations between wavenumbers of modes (kr+1 = kr/N, where
N is an integer) and their phase relations.

On the other hand, these model signals do not reﬂect such properties of Burgers turbu-
lence as qualitative diﬀerence in the behaviour of the turbulence for n < 1 and n > 1 in
the power spectrum (1.9) due to the process of generation of large scale components in the
spectrum. For the deterministic model this process is not present due to the special relation
of wavenumbers.

Let as now move to the mechanical interpretation of solution of the Burgers equation.
For the initial reverse sawtooth wave, all the matter turns into heavy particles at the same
moment of time. Thus, after this time, the evolution of Burgers turbulence is fully deter-
mined by the motion of heavy particles. The trajectories of heavy particles form regular
tree-like structure on the plane (X, t), see Figs. 3 and 4. The properties of this structure
depend on the parameters of our model. The integer ǫ−1 = N is the number of trajectories
which intersect at one point and form a new branch of our structure. For ǫ−1 = N = 2 we,
thus, obtain binary tree structure. Changing of the parameter h stretches or contracts the
structure in the t direction. One can say that our structure is the plane representation of
the N−tree; the root of our tree is located at t = +∞. This tree is similar to the ﬂattened

fractal model of botanical umbrella tree (see [21]).

structure as a root, and consider the trajectories of all heavy particles, which will merge
at the moment of time T at this point (X, T ) we shall also obtain an n-tree. The whole
tree seems self-similar, because every branch plus the branches it carries is a reduced scale
version of the whole.

We also notice that such multiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional

Burgers’ equation.

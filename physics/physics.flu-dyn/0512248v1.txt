Vortex breakdown can be described as a change in vortex core structures in which a recirculation

ﬂux induces the formation of bubbles in the rotation axis. The development and control of a laminar

vortex breakdown of a ﬂow enclosed in a cylinder is studied both theoretical and experimentally.

We show that the vortex breakdown can be controlled by the introduction of a small ﬁxed rod in

the axis of the cylinder. This method is simpler than those previously proposed, since it does not

require any auxiliary device system. The experimental observations are consistent with the results

of a simple model to predict the onset of vortex breakdown.

INTRODUCTION

The development of structure changes in vortical ﬂows [1, 2, 3, 4] has been intensively investigated during the

last years [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. These structural changes are very important in several applications of Fluid

mechanics such as aerodynamics, combustion or bioreactors.

In this paper we focus on the so–called vortex breakdown (VB) which appear in vortical ﬂows when the swirl

parameter S is larger than a critical value Sc [5]. The characteristic and fundamental signature of the vortex breakdown

is the appearance of a stagnation point followed by regions of reversed axial ﬂows with a bubble structure. This is also

accompanied by a sudden change of the size core and the appearance of disturbances downstream the enlargement of

the core.

Many proposals have been given to explain the origin of the vortex breakdown. Some of the them are based

on instability mechanisms, while in other cases the proposed theories consider that hydrodynamical instabilities do

no play a signiﬁcant role. In any case, it is widely accepted that instabilities arise after the occurrence of vortex

breakdown.

The vortex breakdown has been observed not only in open ﬂows, but also in experiments performed in conﬁned

ﬂows, for example, closed cylinders[3]. It is worth noting that the characteristics of the VB in both cases are strongly

similar, suggesting the possibility that the basic mechanism of the VB is the same in both situations. While many

analytical and theoretical eﬀort has been done in the study of the VB emergence in open ﬂows, less results have been

obtained for closed ﬂows. In a way, this may be explained by the fact that in the later case, the basic ﬂow to be

studied is much more complex than those typically observed in open ducts. Experimental measurements show that

the ﬂows in open channels can be accurately described with the relatively simple q-vortex proposed by Leibovich

[5]. This contrast with the complicated three dimensional structure of the ﬂow in closed cylinders, as is shown in

numerical simulations. An analytical expression for the ﬂow in conﬁned cylinders for ﬁnite Reynolds numbers Re is

not known. On the other hand, from an experimental point of view, experiments performed in conﬁned cylinder are

very attractive because they are simpler to control. Due to the great number of practical implications of the VB, it

is natural the interest in the development of mechanisms of controlling its emergence.

Recently, diﬀerent methods of controlling VB were proposed, using techniques as co–rotation and contour–rotation

of the end-walls [12], the addition of near axis swirl on the axis cylinder [10] or at the end wall or temperature gradients

[14]. Experiments show that such methods are eﬀective to control the VB in the sense that the critical Reynolds

number may be increased or decreased. In spite of this fact, it is still of interest the search for simpler methods from

a practical point of view.

The aim of the present work is to develop a method of controlling the vortex breakdown. This paper is organized as

follows. In Sec. II we analyze a simple model to predict the onset of the vortex breakdown. We show that this model

indicated a strategy to realize this control that is in agreement with the experimental results presented in Sec. III.

The comparison between the experiments and the theoretical model is given in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V we present

a summary and the conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

In the past, it has been shown that simple theoretical vortex models of open ﬂows may predict behaviors that are

very similar to the vortex breakdown. A classical approach based on axisymmetric inviscid analysis was given by

Batchelor [16]. In this model, it is assumed that far upstream the ﬂuid moves inside a duct of radius R0 following a

Rankine vortex. This vortex has a core of radius c0 which rotates like a solid body with constant angular velocity σ

and an outer irrotational region. The whole vortex has an axial motion with velocity U0. In a cylindrical system of

coordinates (r, θ, z) the velocity ﬁeld is written as:

vr = 0,

The same relations hold downstream for the steady ﬂow, so that Eq. (4) takes the form

If we restrict ourselves to consider cylindrical solutions, it is obtained the general solution for the rotational region of

the ﬂow is

where F1 and Y1 are the Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and second kind respectively and γ = 2σ/U0 [16]. The ﬂow in

the irrotational region is given by

where U is a constant.

We assume that downstream the ﬂuid is constrained to move inside another cylindrical duct of radius R (see

Fig. 1). Thus it follows that B = 0,

in order to avoid the divergence of Ψ at r = 0. The no mass ﬂow condition at

the solid boundary is automatically satisﬁed because the ﬂow have not radial component. Therefore, the downstream

cylindrical ﬂow in the rotational part (r < c, where c is the radius of the rotational core) is given by

and S is the swirl parameter, deﬁned as S = Rγ = 2σR

determined imposing the mass conservation and the continuity of the pressure. From these conditions, we obtain the

We solved this equation for diﬀerent values of the parameters. According to the value of S, it may happen that

two branches of solutions for c may collide and disappear. In Batchelor approach [16], the disappearance of these

solutions is interpreted as the signal of VB emergence. Since Batchelor’s argument is somewhat indirect, we discuss

now an alternative way to support this interpretation. We deﬁne that Sc and SV B are the critical values of the swirl

parameter for the disappearance of cylindrical solutions and the emergence of VB respectively. As already mentioned,

the typical signature of the VB is the formation of a stagnation point, followed by regions with reversion of the axial

velocity. In the neighborhood of the stagnation point, a quasi-cylindrical description of the ﬂow is doomed to failure,

because in this place the ﬂow is strongly dependent on the axial coordinate z. Thus, in the presence of VB (S > SV B),

there is not cylindrical solution describing the ﬂow (S > Sc). On the other hand, in the absence of VB (S < SV B),

a quasi-cylindrical description is suitable and probably do exist a cylindrical solution to describe the ﬂow (S < Sc).

Then, it is reasonable to assume that the critical value SV B for the emergence of VB and the critical value Sc for

the disappearance of cylindrical solutions are very close one another, i.e. SV B ≈ Sc, and the identiﬁcation of both

may be a practical criteria for VB. From now on, this is the criteria we use to estimate the critical conditions for the

emergence of VB.

We shall employ the above model of open ﬂows to study qualitatively the ﬂow in the closed cylinder. In doing

so, we make the hypothesis that the ﬂow inside the closed cylinder can be described locally as an open ﬂow, as it is

shown in Fig. 1. The ﬂow inside the cylinder is similar to the open ﬂow near a transition between two cylindrical

ducts (regions I and II of Fig. 1), where the ﬁrst of them is a coaxial duct with an inner cylinder of radius d1. Since

the ﬂow inside the dashed boxes are similar in both cases, it is reasonably to expect that the phenomena that occur

inside each of them are analogous. We suppose that the ﬂow in region I in turn comes from a region 0 (not shown

in Fig. 1), where the ﬂow ﬁeld is given by Eq. (1). We shall denote as c0 the core size in region I. In this region, the

general expression for the ﬂow, for 0 ≤ r < c1, is given by

while for c1 ≤ r < R, is

where the constants A1 and B1 may be calculated as functions of R0, c0, d1, R, U0 and σ. The cylindrical ﬂow in

region II is given by the ﬂow (9). Thus the radius of the core c is to be determined with the Eq. (12). We solved this

equation for diﬀerent values of the relevant parameters. We found that, for some values of R0, c0 and U0, cylindrical

solutions do not exist in region II if S is above a critical value Sc (see Fig. 2), although there exist cylindrical solutions

in region I for the same values of the parameters at any value of S. According to the mentioned criterion, this means

that VB takes place inside region II (but not in region I), when the swirl parameter S is larger than a critical value

Sc. This behavior reproduces qualitatively the phenomena inside the closed cylinder.

We use our model to estimate how do the changes in the geometry of the region II aﬀect the development of VB.

The modiﬁcations that we considered were the introduction of cylinders along the duct axis, with diﬀerent diameters.

Using the formalism described above, we obtain the following equation that determines the radius of the rotational

core c in region II in presence of the inner cylinder of radius d

In ﬁgures 2 and 3 it is shown the inﬂuence of the inner cylinder on the disappearance of cylindrical solutions. The

eﬀect of a very slender inner cylinder may be to increase (Fig. 2) or decrease (Fig. 3) slightly the critical value Sc.

However, for all the situations considered, the critical value Sc increases as long as d is above a threshold. In this

case, the emergence of VB was transferred to larger values of the swirl parameter, and the VB was suppressed in the

range of S values contained between the old and new critical values of S (see Fig. 4). These results show that the

model predicts the suppressing eﬀect of the slender cylinders. In the next section, we shall contrast these theoretical

results with the experimental observations.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS

The experimental setup consists of an acrylic cylindrical container of inner radius R = 80 mm and a rotating top

disk at a variable height H rotating with angular velocity Ω (ﬁgure 5). The ﬂuid used is water dissolutions of glycerin

at 60% in mass, with ν = 1 × 10−5 m2/s. Temperature was kept constant at 200C. Reynolds number corresponding

to the rotating top wall, Re = ΩR2/ν, varies between 600 and 2600, with a 1% error. Four diﬀerent aspect ratios

H/R were used: 1, 1.5 ,2 and 2.5. The visualization system consists of a vertical sheet of light with 2 mm of thickness,

generated by two slide projectors, in order to visualizes the ﬂow line generated by ﬂuorescein that was injected through

a small hole in the bottom disk. Photographs were taken using a 5 megapixel Canon digital camera. To investigate

the eﬀect of the inner cylinders on the VB, we have used three axial ﬁxed rod of radius d = 2 mm, d = 5 mm and

d = 10 mm.

For convenient comparison with previous works [3] , we have studied ﬁrst the dynamical behavior of usual vortex

breakdown without axis rod. In Fig. 6 it can be observed the experimental results for diﬀerent aspect ratios. For

H/R = 1, the vortex breakdown does not appear. For H/R = 1.5, the vortex breakdown take place for Re = 940.

8

With further increment of Reynolds number, the recirculation bubble becomes oscillatory (Re = 1732), and for Re

= 1852, disappears. These results agree with classical work of Escudier [3]. For H/R = 2 and 2.5, ﬁrst one and

posteriorly two vortex breakdown are generated when the Reynolds number is increased. It is possible to see in ﬁgure

7 the interior detailed structure of the recirculation bubble.

We consider the situation in which it is introduced an axial ﬁxed rod of radius d. For d = 2 mm, the changes in the

ﬂow are so small in comparison with the situation without rod. However, for d = 5 mm and d = 10 mm, we observe

that the Reynolds number necessary to produce the vortex breakdown is increased. In Table I the experimental results

are summarized. In Fig. 9 it is shown the Reynolds number as a function of the aspect ratio. We note that, however,

for values of Re for which the VB develops with or without the presence of the rods, the size of the bubble and it

dynamics is aﬀected by the presence of the inner cylinder. For example, Figure 8, shows the vortex breakdown for

H/R = 2.5 and Re=2260. We can observe that without axial rod, there are two VB, but they are oscillating (Fig.

8a). For d = 5 mm, there are two VB, but now they are steady (Fig. 8b) and for d = 10 mm, only one VB appears.

In addition, the size of the bubble corresponding to the ﬁrst VB was clearly decreased with the presence of the rods.

IV. DISCUSSION

From the tables and ﬁgures it can be concluded that the usage of the inner rods allows us to control the vortex onset.

These experimental results about the eﬀect of the cylinders on the ﬁrst bubble formation are in agreement with the

prediction of the theoretical model, if we make the hypothesis the swirl parameter increases as Re increases. In this

case, the experimental observation that Rec increases with the presence of the rod is consistent with the increment

of Sc that is obtained with the model. This dependence of S on Re is suggested by the fact that both quantities

are proportional to the angular momentum of the ﬂow. However, a rigorous justiﬁcation of this relation is not

straightforward, since the swirl parameter also depends on the axial component of the velocity at the axis. Recently,

Husain et al proposed arguments that support this hypothesis [10]. In this work, the authors also considered that the

swirl number is the relevant parameter that controls the VB.

The changes of the critical Reynolds number due to the rods presence are not small but very noticeable, as follows

from table 1. The simplicity of the model do not allow the description of all the variety of phenomena that were

observed in the experiments i.e. the development of two VB. Moreover, we observe that also in the presence of two

bubbles, it is necessary larger values of the Reynolds number for the development of the second bubble in comparison

with the situation without rod. It is worth noting that our results are in agreement with those of Hussain et al [10],

in so far as that the very slender rod does not introduce signiﬁcant changes in the ﬂow (the radius ratio used was

d/R = 0.04, which is very similar to the small radius ratio value we considered, that is d/R = 0.05).

It is also interesting to compare our results with those obtained by Mullin et al [11]. These authors did not obtained

noticeable changes in the emergence of VB with the addition of a inner cylinder with ratio d/R = 0.1. However, in

our experiments we observed appreciable changes in the ﬂow, for values of the ratio d/R larger than 0.1 (d/R = 0.125

and d/R = .25).

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we presented a new method of controlling the onset of VB. It consists basically of the addition of a

small cylinder at rest in the axis of the cylindrical container. The experiments we performed show that this procedure

increases the critical Reynolds number for the emergence of VB, and consequently suppress the onset of VB in a

certain range of values of Re. This eﬀect is in agreement with the results of a simple theoretical model of VB based

on the failure of the quasi-cylindrical approximation. The model includes the hypothesis S increases with Re.

The control technique proposed here is simpler than other previously proposed in the literature, since it does not

require additional auxiliary devices. The simplicity of a method is in general an interesting feature, becoming more

feasible to be used in engineering devices. Moreover, the required modiﬁcation of the duct is relatively small. The

volume ratio (cylinder to row) is V1/V2 ∼ 4 × 10−3, while the decrease of the critical Reynolds number is about 10% .

So that the shift of the critical Reynolds number is 20 times larger that the percent modiﬁcation of the volume of the

cylinder, showing the eﬀectiveness of the method. The above results suggest two lines for future investigation. One of

them is to essay variants of the method presented here, in order to optimize it controlling eﬀect on VB development.

Secondly, to develop a more elaborate theoretical analysis, using velocity ﬁelds ﬁne adjusted to the real ones , in order

to test more accurately the criterion of quasi-cylindrical failure for the onset of VB.

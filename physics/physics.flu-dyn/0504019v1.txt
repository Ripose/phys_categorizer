The derivation of the equation of one-dimensional movement of a solitary shock
wave is given. This derivation shows, that the diﬀerential equation of movement
of a solitary plane shock wave in the channel with variable area, is exact, if simpli-
fying assumptions, made during derivation, are realized. But these assumptions
in plane geometry it is possible to realize only approximately; situation with
spherical and cylindrical shock waves is opposite.

Introduction

In 1957 Chisnell [1], being based on ideas of Chester [2], has deduced the
equation of one-dimensional movement of a solitary shock wave on substance
with polytropic equation of state. A little bit later the Whitham [3] has
oﬀered ”... simple rule”, which together with shock relations ”... determines
the motion of the shock wave”. Actually Whitham was the ﬁrst, who has
considered the equation of one-dimensional movement of a solitary shock wave
on substance with the arbitrary equation of state (see below the equation
(14)), but as the approximate equation, from which for a special case of the
polytropic equation of a state, one can derive the Chisnell equation.

2 The derivation of the equation

We shall consider one-dimensional movements of solitary shock waves. Move-
ment of a shock wave is identiﬁed with movement of its front. One-dimensional
movements of shock waves are understood as movements of spherically sym-
metric, spherically symmetric and plane shock waves. Shock waves are as-
it is not considered overtaking one shock wave by other
sumed solitary, i.e.
shock wave etc. Naturally, the solitary shock wave is an abstraction. Be-

low, during the derivation of the equation of one-dimensional movement of a
solitary plane shock wave the diﬀerential calculus will be used, how it was in-
tuitively used in Newton time. After development of the nonstandard analysis
by Robinson (see [4]) such operating with inﬁnitesimal diﬀerentials may be
regarded as quite correct.

Following Chisnell, we shall consider movement of a plane shock wave in
the channel, having in some place inﬁnitesimal jump of the sectional area dA
– see ﬁgure (cp. it with Fig. 1 in Chisnell’s article [1], this ﬁgure can be also
compared with Fig. 1, p. 193 in [5]). Let’s choose the system of coordinates

Figure 1: The shock wave, separating region 1, 2, is incident on small change
in the area of a channel from A to A + dA. The resulting transmitted shock
separates regions 4, 5. Regions 3, 4 are separated by simple Riemann wave.
The shape of the channel is shown on the top of the ﬁgure.

connected to the channel, which axis X we shall direct along the channel. We
shall assume, that walls of the channel are indeﬁnitely rigid, so it is possible
to neglect interaction of a shock wave with them, the plane front of a shock
wave is perpendicular to walls of the channel etc. (i.e.
it is supposed, that
it is possible to neglect the three-dimensional eﬀects arising at movement of
a shock wave), the substance before front of a shock wave is homogeneous

and is motionless relatively the channel (at presence of the area change last
assumption is implicitly containing in the assumption of homogeneity of sub-
stance before front of a shock wave). As it is usually accepted, by an index ”0”
we shall mark parameters of substance before front of a shock wave. As one-
dimensional movement is considered, all vectors can be identiﬁed with their
projections to axis X. Thus: u0 = 0, ρ0, p0, ε0, s0 – respectively, speed (
≡
projection of speed on axis X), density, pressure, speciﬁc (referred to a mass
unit) internal energy, speciﬁc (referred to a mass unit) entropy of substance
before front of a shock wave. As the parameter, deﬁning strength of a shock
wave, we shall take:

σ =

ρ
ρ0

.

(1)

– the ratio of density of substance behind front of a shock wave to density of
substance before front of a shock wave. It is universal, dimensionless, ﬁnite
parameter. Chisnell as the parameter, describing strength of a shock wave,
have used the ratio of pressure: z = p/p0, – that can not be used, for example,
for some equations of a state of substance, when p0 = 0. In one-dimensional
case assignment of σ (or z), with known parameters of substance before the
front of the shock wave u0 = 0, ρ0, p0 completely determines parameters of
substance behind front of a shock wave and speed of movement of shock wave
D – see theorem 5.5 in [5].

On Fig. 1 the situation is schematically represented, when the shock wave,
moving from the left to the right in positive direction of axis X (D > 0), will
pass through jump of area of the channel dA. Arising gas-dynamic break splits
into simple Riemann r-wave (according to deﬁnition in
16, [5]) moving back
from the front of the shock wave and shock wave with changed on dσ strength,
moving to the right (see
17 in [5]). For initial shock wave moving from right
to left (D < 0) instead of r-wave we should have Riemann l-wave – theorem
16.2 in [5]. Situation, represented on Fig. 1 corresponds to supersonic motion
> c, where c – speed of a sound behind
behind front of the shock wave
front of a shock wave. Following reasonings are correct without change and in
a subsonic case –

Changes of speed u and pressure p behind front of the shock wave, corre-
sponding to change of shock wave strength after passage of the area change, are
”compensated” by changes of speed dAu and pressure dAp at adiabatic ﬂowing
of substance behind front of shock wave through the jump of the sectional area
and by changes of speed and pressure in Riemann wave (for Riemann r-wave,
when D > 0, index ”+” will be used, for l-wave – index ”−”). Thus, we have

the system of the equations:

At adiabatic ﬂowing of substance behind front of the shock wave through the
jump of the sectional area dA following relations must be satisﬁed:

First of them expresses law of conservation of mass, the second is Bernoulli
equation, the last – adiabatic condition. The adiabatic condition implies equal-
ities:

Using (7) and (8), from (4)-(6) we receive system of the equations:

The system of the equations (9)-(11) completely determines changes of param-

channel.

In Riemann wave the changes of parameters of substance are in accord

with relations:

The equation (12) follows from deﬁnition of Riemann invariants and the equa-
tion (13) follows from adiabatic condition for movement in Riemann wave.

It is interesting to note, that the right part of the equation (14) is a product
of a combination of speed of substance and speed of a sound on diﬀerential of
appropriate Riemann invariant.

For the channel with arbitrary (smooth) dependence of the area of section
on coordinate x – A (x), in the assumption of plane symmetry of considered
movement, it is possible to pass from diﬀerential (14) to integrated equality:

– where Ai and σi – values A and σ at some moment of time ti.

The equation (15) can be named (integrated) equation of movement of a
solitary plane shock wave on homogeneous substance in the channel of variable
area, as at known dependence A (x) it determines speed of shock wave D as
implicit function of coordinate x and with trivial equation:

dx
dt

= D (x) ,

– allows to describe movement of a shock wave completely. The equation
(14) now, accordingly, can be named the diﬀerential equation of movement
of a plane solitary shock wave on homogeneous substance in the channel of
variable section.

The equation (14) can be trivial generalized, if substance before front of
a shock wave is not homogeneous. For this purpose, in equations(2), (3) it
is necessary to replace diﬀerentials du
dσ with the more general
expressions du and dp, because using theorem 5.5 in [5] one can write:

– instead of σ, u0, ρ0, p0, other choice of parameters is possible also. After

by Vakhrameev – see [6], [7].

to absolute zero.

Let’s look, how in case of polytropic equation of a state the equation (20) can
be derived from the equation (14). For deﬁniteness we shall consider shock
wave, moving in a positive direction of axis X (D > 0). Then we take signs

4 Comparison of diﬀerent solutions

One of the most important examples of one-dimensional movements of shock
waves is movement on homogeneous substance solitary converging spherically
symmetric shock wave. Choosing small enough solid angle with top in the
centre of symmetry of a shock wave, we can see, that it is possible to consider
movement of a shock wave inside such solid angle, as movement in the channel
rα, α = 2, r – radius of
with the variable sectional area (A = constant
front of a shock wave in spherical system of coordinates with the beginning
in the centre of symmetry of a shock wave), and all assumptions of section 2
are precisely carried out. Therefore movement of spherically symmetric shock
wave in spherical system of coordinates, which beginning coincides with the

·

centre of symmetry of a shock wave, is described by the equation (see the
equation (15)):

Similar reasonings show, that the equation (28) describes also movement of
solitary converging cylindrically symmetric shock waves (α = 1, r – radius of
front of a shock wave in cylindrical system of coordinates with the beginning
on an axis of symmetry of a shock wave). Signs in the right part of the equation
(28) are taken according to agreements in Sec. 2).

The ﬁnding of the analytical solution of the equation (28) for the concrete
equation of state of substance can be not trivial problem – see Chisnell’s
solution (21)-(22). However, with the help of asymptotic analysis of functions
of real variable (see, for example, chapter 5 in [8]) it is often easily to receive
asymptotic solution (at r
0) of the equation (28), that is also interesting
enough. Thus received asymptotic solution of the equation (28), generally
speaking, are logarithmically equivalent to the true solution – see deﬁnition 5,
1, chapters 5 in [8]. It is dictated by structure of the right part of the equation
§
(28). Analytical Chisnell solution for polytropic equations of state allows to
receive strongly equivalent solution of the equation (28) (see deﬁnition 4,
1,
chapters 5 in [8]):

It is visible, that the accordance is very good. Small distinction of values
could be tried to explain, how it tried to make Chisnell [1], that at derivation
of the equation (14) possible change d2σ of strength of shock wave, caused
by reﬂection of the simple Riemann wave, which has arisen at jump of the
sectional area of the channel dA2, from earlier arisen distortion (at jump of

To understand the true reason of discrepancy of solutions we shall return to
derivation of the equation (14). The derivation of the equation (14) is unusual.
It is not local in the sense, that changes of the values relating to various points
of space are considered. Therefore it would be possible to expect, that the
type of symmetry of task will somehow show itself. Equation (12) determining
linear connection of inﬁnitesimal changes of speed of substance and pressure in
simple Riemann wave in case of spherical (cylindrical) symmetry is incorrect.
It would be necessary to replace it with more general relation (see, for example,
[13],

2.7 of chapter 2):

α = 0, 1, 2 – correspondingly, in case of plane, cylindrical and spherical sym-
metry. Thus, the equation (14) for spherical (cylindrical) sound waves should
be considered as approximated.

5 Conclusions

Given derivation of equation of movement of a solitary shock wave in the
channel of variable area shows, why this equation may be only approximate
for cylindrical and spherical convergent waves. But such approximation has
high precision and may be used for estimations.

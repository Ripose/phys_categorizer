The random forced Navier-Stokes equation can be obtained as a variational problem of a proper

action. By virtue of incompressibility, the integration over transverse components of the ﬁelds allows

to cast the action in the form of a large deviation functional. Since the hydrodynamic operator is

nonlinear, the functional integral yielding the statistics of ﬂuctuations can be practically computed

by linearizing around a physical solution of the hydrodynamic equation. We show that this procedure

yields the dimensional scaling predicted by K41 theory at the lowest perturbative order, where the

perturbation parameter is the inverse Reynolds number. Moreover, an explicit expression of the

prefactor of the scaling law is obtained.

I. INTRODUCTION

A ﬁeld theoretic approach to the study of the random stirred Navier-Stokes equation (rsNSE) can be traced back

to the seminal paper by Martin, Siggia and Rose [1]. This was the starting point for the application of many ﬁeld-

theoretic strategies, e.g. diagramatic expansions, renormalization group methods [2] (for recent developments and

applications the reader can be addressed to [3]), instanton-based approaches (for applications of instantonic methods

in turbulence see, e.g., [4–7] and references therein) and combinations of them [8]. The many technical diﬃculties

encountered in developing these approaches avoided to gather conclusive achievements.

In this paper we show that one step forward along this ﬁeld-theoretic approach allows one to cast the action associated

with the rsNSE into the form of a large deviation functional. Recently, large-deviation theory has scored sensible

success in describing ﬂuctuations in stationary non-equilibrium regimes of various microscopic models [9]. This

approach is mainly based on the extension of the time-reversal conjugacy property introduced by Onsager and Machlup

1

[10] to stationary non-equilibrium states. In practice, thermal ﬂuctuations in irreversible stationary processes can be

traced back to a proper hydrodynamic description derived from the microscopic evolution rules. The general form of

the action functional is

I[(t1,t2)](ρ) =

where ρ(t, ~x) represents in general a vector of thermodynamic variables depending on time t and space variables ~x.

The symbol

,

denotes the integration over space variables. W is a hydrodynamic evolution operator acting on

h·

·i

ρ: it vanishes when ρ is equal to the stationary solution ¯ρ, which is assumed to be unique. The positive kernel K(ρ)

represents the stochasticity of the system at macroscopic level. According to the large deviation-theory, the entropy

S of a stationary non-equilibrium state is related to the action functional I as follows:

where the minimum is taken over all trajectories connecting ¯ρ to ˆρ.

S(ρ) = inf
ρ

I[

−∞

,0](ˆρ)

For our purposes it is enough to consider that the action functional I provides a natural measure for statistical

ﬂuctuations in non-equilibrium stationary states, so that, formally, any statistical inference can be obtained from I.

Indeed, from the very beginning we have to deal with a hydrodynamic formulation, namely the rsNSE: in the next

Section we will argue that an action functional of the form (1) can be obtained by ﬁeld-theoretic analytic calculations.

In particular, explicit integration over all longitudinal components of the velocity ﬁeld and over the associated

auxiliary ﬁelds can be performed. This allows to obtain a hydrodynamic evolution operator W which depends only

on the transverse components of the velocity ﬁeld vα

T (t, ~x) (α = 1, 2, 3). Moreover, the positive kernel K amounts to

the inverse correlation function of the stochastic source. This formulation allows to overcome some of the technical

diﬃculties characterizing standard perturbative methods and diagramatic expansions.

On the other hand, we have to face with new diﬃculties. The hydrodynamic operator appearing in the large

deviation functional is nonlinear, so that functional integration is unfeasible. One has to identify a solution ¯vα

T (t, ~x)

of the associated hydrodynamic equation and linearize the hydrodynamic operator around such a solution. Then,

functional integration can be performed explicitly on the “ﬂuctuation” ﬁeld. In order to be well deﬁned, this ap-

proximate procedure would demand the uniqueness of the solution of the nonlinear hydrodynamic equation. For this

reason we have restricted our choice to a class of space–time functions which are also solutions of the linear problem.

Among them, there is only one function which satisﬁes physically relevant boundary conditions (see Section III).

Statistical ﬂuctuations have been estimated with respect to this solution, which has also the advantage of reducing

2

the dependence of the generating functional on the pressure ﬁeld to a trivial constraint. In practice, we construct a

perturbative saddle-point approach based on a linearization procedure of the velocity ﬁeld vα

T (t, ~x) around ¯vα

T (t, ~x).

As a consequence of the nonlinear character of the original problem. the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld uα

T (t, ~x) = vα

T (t, ~x)

¯vα
T (t, ~x)

−

is found to obey a linearized hydrodynamic problem with coeﬃcients depending on space and time through ¯vα

T (t, ~x).

It is worth stressing that even the solution of the linearized problem is nontrivial and it is found to depend naturally

on a perturbative parameter

1, the inverse of the Reynolds number. We exploit this property by constructing a

−

R

further perturbation procedure to obtain an explicit expression for uα

T (t, ~x) at diﬀerent orders in

1. These points

−

R

are discussed in Section IV.

Since our main purpose here is the estimation of the structure function (see Section V) as an average over the

non-equilibrium measure induced by the action I, we have to assume that the perturbative expansion applies in a

wide range of values of

. In particular, we guess that it holds also for moderately large

, since a statistical average

R

R

of any observable cannot be valid for too large values of

, i.e.

in a regime of fully developed turbulence. We will

argue that statistical estimates can be consistently obtained for values of

which extend up to the region of stability

of the solution ¯vα

T (t, ~x). Beyond this region we have no practical way of controlling the convergence of the linearization

procedure. It is worth stressing that we obtain an analytic expression of the structure function: the so–called K41

R

R

scaling law [11] is recovered on a spatial scale, whose nontrivial dependence on

is explicitly indicated.

R

At the present stage, we are not able to say at which extent our results on the dimensional scaling are dependent

on the particular choice we did for the solution around which we studied the ﬂuctuations. Further investigations are

needed to clarify this important point, which probably require the combination of analytical and numerical techniques.

II. THE MODEL

We consider the Navier-Stokes equation for the velocity vector-ﬁeld components vα(t, ~x) describing a divergence-free

homogeneous isotropic ﬂow:

ﬂuctuations. Customarily [12], we assume f α to be a white-in-time zero-mean Gaussian random force with covariance

In principle, this is a very diﬃcult task due to the nonlinear character ot the constraint.

In the following section we show that we can identify a particular extremal solution, ¯vT , of the functional (12).

This solution is found to be independent of the stochastic source and, moreover, it satisﬁes constraint (13) for any

constant value of the pressure. Accordingly, I(vT ) can be interpreted as a large deviation functional (see eq.(1)) and

the statistical nonequilibrium measure of the rsNSE can be eﬀectively evaluated by integrating over the ﬂuctuations

around this extremal solution. It is worth observing that the entropy is related to the functional I(vT ) by the relation

[9]

S(vT ) =

I(vT ) ,

where the minimum is taken over all trajectories connecting ¯vT to vT .

In what follows we are going to show that a suitable perturbative strategy can be applied for obtaining explicit analytic

calculations of the statistical properties of the rsNSE.

III. A QUASI-STEADY SOLUTION AND ITS STABILITY

Any analytic approach aiming at the estimation of the generating functional (11) demands the identiﬁcation of an

explicit solution of the action functional (12). In practice, this amounts to solve the stationarity condition

L solution (18) approximates a linear shear ﬂow: this is well known to produce instabilities for suﬃciently

In the linear approximation one obtains an equation for δvα

T (t, ~x), which can be

solved explicitly by performing an expansion in the inverse Reynolds number

1. As shown in Appendix A, the

perturbation ﬁeld vanishes and, accordingly, (18) is stable for suﬃciently large times and Reynolds numbers and

provided the following inequality holds:

8ν2
U 2 k2 > 1 .

R

(21)

This inequality implies that for increasing values of

the band of unstable modes becomes thinner and thinner.

As a consequence, solving the stability problem by expanding the solution of the linearized dynamics (A1) in powers

of

−

R

1 is consistent with this ﬁnding. Since condition (21) has been derived by assuming

large, it is not in

R

contradiction with the Landau scenario for the origin of turbulence.

In summary, ¯vα

T (t, ~x) exhibits all the expected features of a physically relevant solution, which corresponds to

stationarity conditions for the large–deviation functional. Accordingly, it can be eﬀectively used for computing

statistical non–equilibrium ﬂuctuations of the rsNSE. In the next section we will exploit a saddle point strategy for

performing explicit calculations from the generating functional.

IV. PERTURBATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE GENERATING FUNCTIONAL

All statistical properties concerning the rsNSE are contained in the structure functions which can be obtained

by performing derivatives of the generating functional (11) with respect to the current J α. An explicit calculation

is unfeasible due to the nonlinear character of the action functional I(vT ). Since in the previous section we have

identiﬁed the solution ¯vα

T , we can tackle the problem by introducing the velocity ﬁeld uα

T = vα

¯vα
T , which represents

T −

ﬂuctuations with respect to ¯vα

T , and by applying a saddle–point strategy.

Due to the translational invariance of the functional measure, the generating functional (11) can be rewritten as

Consistently with this perturbative approach, we can also assume that, at leading order, constraint (13) is still trivially

solved by (18), i.e. the pressure P is a constant.

In this way the action functional (23) has a bilinear form in the ﬁeld uα

T , with coeﬃcients depending on ¯vα

T . In order

to perform explicit Gaussian integration of the generating functional one has ﬁrst to understand how the technical

diﬃculties inherent such a dependence can be circumvented. The ﬁrst problem that we have to face with is that, since

(18) is deﬁned only for t > 0, also (23) is deﬁned for positive times. As we discuss in Appendix B, a standard procedure

allows one to get rid of any singularity of the action integral that might emerge for t

0+. This is a consequence of

→

the stucture of the linearized hydrodynamic operator appearing in (23). The second problem concerns the possibility

of obtaining an analytic expression for the generating functional. To this aim one can exploit a perturbative expansion

of (18) in powers of the inverse Reynolds number

V. SHORT-DISTANCE BEHAVIOR OF THE SECOND ORDER STRUCTURE FUNCTION

The analytic expression obtained for the generating functional (30) allows one to obtain all the statistical information

about the ﬂuctuations around the basic solution ¯vα

T . In this section we perform the explicit calculation of the second-

order structure function of the velocity ﬁeld uα, deﬁned as

The brackets denote averages over the stochastic forcing.

By assuming isotropy and homogeneity of the velocity ﬁeld uα, expression (31) is expected to assume the typical form

of a scale invariant function

Here r =

fully developed turbulent regimes, here the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity have to be taken as a plausible

hypothesis allowing for analytic computations.

We want to point out that any exponent ζn must be independent of the basis chosen for representing the functional

. For the sake of simplicity, it is worth using (29) rather than (30) to obtain:

The main contribution of the stochastic measure p2+se−

of wavenumbers close to ¯p, where the function p2+se−

has its maximum, i.e.

Accordingly, the function 8ν

general expression of the coeﬃcients Cn(Σ) appearing in (40) has been omitted, because it has no practical interest

for explicit calculations.

It is a remarkable fact that S2 can exhibit the scaling behavior predicted by the K41 theory, which is assumed to

hold (apart from intermittency corrections) when the velocity ﬂuctuations are turbulent in the so-called inertial range

of scales. This suggests that hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations in a system at the very initial stage of instability development

already contain some properties attributed to the developed turbulence regime.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have exploited the ﬁeld-theoretic approach to reformulate the random forced Navier–Stokes problem

in terms of the evaluation of a quadratic action. This has the formal structure of a large–deviation functional,

describing thermal ﬂuctuations of irreversible stationary processes. The crucial step for obtaining such a statistical

representation is the integration over all longitudinal components of both velocity and the associated auxiliary ﬁelds.

With respect to the standard formulation which yields usual diagramatic strategies, we perform one more ﬁeld

integration. The positive deﬁnite kernel, which connects the hydrodynamic evolution operator in the action functional,

is the inverse of the forcing correlation function.

In terms of the action functional, the knowledge of the whole velocity statistics reduces to the computation of functional

integrals. However, due to the intrinsic nonlinear character of the hydrodynamic operator several technical diﬃculties

have been solved for performing analytic calculations. In particular, one has to to introduce suitable approximations.

In order to obtain an analytic expression of the generating functional we have identiﬁed a solution around which

we have linearized the hydrodynamic evolution operator. We have also introduced a velocity ﬁeld which represents

ﬂuctuations with respect to this solution. A perturbative expansion in the inverse Reynolds number ﬁnally yields the

wanted result.

In principle, from this analytic treatment one can obtain all relevant statistical information about the rsNSE by

computing any velocity multipoint structure function. In this paper we report only the explicit calculation of the

two–point second order moment of the velocity ﬁeld. As shown in the Appendices, the algebraic manipulations needed

for obtaining the ﬁnal result are far from trivial also in this simple case.

In fact, in this paper we aim at understanding whether ﬂuctuations at the early stage of their development (accord-

ingly, we dub them as pre-turbulent ﬂuctuations) already contain some important features of developed turbulence.

12

We are interested, in particular, to characterize the scale invariant properties of such ﬂuctuations. In this respect, we

ﬁnd that they are organized at diﬀerent scales in a self–similar way. Remarkably, the scaling exponent coincides with

the dimensional prediction of the Kolmogorov 1941 theory [11], valid for developed turbulence regimes. Whether or

not such exponent is a genuine reminiscence of the developed turbulence phenomenology needs further investigations.

Unfortunately, the complexity of the derivation leading to the K41 scaling law does not allow us to identify precisely

the very origin of such a dimensional prediction. We can however argue a relationship between the observed dimen-

sional scaling and the conservation laws (for momentum and energy) associated with the two eigenvalues of the matrix

appearing in the action functional (25).

Finally, it is worth observing that the dimensional scaling law emerges for a particular choice we did for the pressure

ﬁeld: ﬂuctautions have been restricted around a solution for which the pressure is constant. Unfortunately, owing to

the fact that the analytical treatment is not duable in the general case, we cannot substantiate the fact on whether

the dimensional prediction we found is not a consequance of our particular choice for the pressure ﬁelds.

At least three scenaries might be possible. Firstly, pressure ﬁeld does not aﬀect neither the leading (dimensional)

scaling law nor its prefactor. It only aﬀects the subleading scaling contributions. In this case our simpliﬁcation would

capture the relevant physics of the problem. The second possibility is that the leading scaling law does not change

but this is not for the prefactor. The last possibility is that pressure changes the (domensional) scaling law giving rise

to intermittency corrections. Unfortunately, at the present stage of our knowledge, we are not in the position to select

one scenary among the three we have pointed out. Further investigations are needed for this aim, which probably call

to deep numerical investigations of the system under consideration.

We want to conclude by outlining some open problems and perspectives. A ﬁrst question concerns the physical

relevance of the solution (18) around which we linerize the evolution operator. It represents a shear-like solution,

which is a well-known generator of instability. Moreover, its unicity and stability properties seem to indicate that this

solution can play a major role in the determination of stationary nonequilibrium ﬂuctuation statistics to be attributed

to the rsNSE. As a mathematical object, it exhibits all the wanted features that one would like to attribute to such a

solution. On the other hand, the authors have not yet a physical intuition for its relevance and aim at making some

future progress in this direction.

Another interesting point to be tackled concerns the computation of the third-order momentum of the velocity cor-

relators. In this case the predictions of our approach could be compared with the 4/5-law, which is one among the

very few exact results of turbulence theories.

13

Finally, the extension of our results to other classes of transport problems, including passive scalar advection, could

provide a better understanding of the basic mechanism at the origin of the observed scaling behaviors.

The exponential term in front of (A6) makes the perturbative solution vanish in the limit of large time t, provided

the perturbative series contained in the curly brackets does not diverge faster in such a limit. This requirement can

be translated into the following spectral condition

This inequality indicates that the instability of solution (18) may originate only from suﬃciently small values of the

wave–number k.

APPENDIX B

As shown in Section III the solution ¯vα

T of the hydrodynamic operator in the action functional (12) is deﬁned for

t > 0. Accordingly, it breaks Galilean invariance, thus giving rise to the well-known Doppler eﬀect, i.e. k0 →

k0+ 1
2

~k

~U .

·

Moreover, since in Section IV we evaluate the action functional by applying a saddle–point expansion around ¯vα
T ,

the approximated expression (23) contains a time integral that has to be restricted to t > 0 only. This amounts to

assume that the action should be identically zero for t < 0. Accordingly, one cannot exclude the possibility that a

singularity in the time integral may originate at t = 0.

In this appendix we want to show that one can easily exclude the presence of any singularity by passing to a

Fourier–transformed representation of the action functional (23): according to a standard ﬁeld-theoretic technique

15

the addition of a small immaginary part to the frequency appearing in the Fourier–transformed integral allows one to

control its regular behavior for t

0+.

→

For the sake of clarity, we present this procedure only for two of the terms appearing in (23). Actually, one can

easily realize that the procedure can be extended to all the terms: we just report the ﬁnal result, thus avoiding the

writing of lengthy formulae.

Since they are deﬁned for t > 0 and the time integral is singular in t = 0, we have that its Fourier–transformed

APPENDIX C

In this Appendix we sketch the calculation of the eigenvalues of the matrix M β

ζ (ˆp) deﬁned in (26). In fact, the

perturbative expansion of the solution (18) in powers of 1
R

induces an analogous expansion for this matrix. Formally,

one can write

M = M(0) + M(1) + ...

λa = λa

Without prejudice of generality, we can specify the geometrical structure of the ﬂow. For the sake of simplicity, we

assume that the vector ~r (i.e. the Fourier–conjugated variable of ~p) corresponds to the polar axis and that the vector

~b is orthogonal to both ~r and ~U . With this assumption the two physically relevant ﬁrst-order corrections to the

eigenvalues are

Abstract

This study proposes a novel framework based on magnitude cumulant and surrogate analyses to

reliably detect and estimate the intermittency coeﬃcient from short-length coarse-resolution tur-

bulent time series. Intermittency coeﬃcients estimated from a large number of neutrally stratiﬁed

atmospheric surface layer turbulent series from various ﬁeld campaigns are shown to remarkably

concur with well-known laboratory experimental results. In addition, a surrogate-based hypothesis

testing framework is proposed and shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the likelihood of detecting a spu-

rious non-zero intermittency coeﬃcient from non-intermittent series. The discriminatory power of

the proposed framework is promising for addressing the unresolved question of how atmospheric

stability aﬀects the intermittency properties of boundary layer turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

Existence of small-scale intermittency is an intriguing yet unsettled topic in contemporary

turbulence research. Over a number of decades, researchers had been trying to unravel inter-

mittency in turbulence measurements and at the same time formulating diverse conceptual

models to rationalize the observed intermittency.1,2 Encouragingly, ‘practical’ implications

of intermittency research outcomes are also being appreciated by the numerical turbulence

modeling community and a critical knowledge transfer is taking place as evidenced by the

recent literature.3–7

One of the most widely used statistics characterizing the intermittent nature of turbulence

is the so-called ‘intermittency exponent’ (µ).8 From observational data, µ can be estimated

directly or indirectly via several methods. The direct estimates typically involve appropriate

characterization of the second-order scaling behavior of the local rate of energy dissipation

(ε) ﬁeld. In this respect, several alternatives (e.g., second-order integral moment, two-point

correlation function, spectral density) are available in the literature.9–11 Recently, Cleve

et al.12 showed that among various direct approaches, the two-point correlation function

hε(x + r)ε(x)i of the energy dissipation ﬁeld provides the most reliable estimates of µ. In

this case, one can write

hε(x + r)ε(x)i ∼ r−µ

(1)

where r is within the inertial range. Here, the angular brackets denote spatial averaging.

The direct intermittency exponent estimation methods (based on ε) require very high-

resolution (resolving on the order of Kolmogorov scale) data series of pristine quality. Most

commonly, fast-response hot wire measurements are used for this purpose.10–14 However,

acquisition of hot wire data in a natural setting could be quite challenging. For example,

in the case of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) ﬁeld experiments, one needs to perform

meticulous hot wire calibration at short regular intervals in order to account for the ever

changing (diurnally varying) ABL ﬂow parameters.15,16

The ABL community widely uses sonic anemometers for turbulent ﬂux measurements

in ﬁelds.

In contrast to hot wires, these sensors require much lesser periodic calibration

and maintenance. Unfortunately, path lengths (∼ 10 cm) and sampling rate (∼ 20 Hz) of

conventional sonic anemometers are too coarse for direct µ estimation. In this paper, we

will explore if sonic anemometer measurements, in lieu of hot wire data, can be reliably used

2

for indirect estimation of µ.

One of the most popular indirect µ estimation methods is associated with the scaling

of sixth-order structure function.13,14,17 With certain plausible assumptions, one can show

that:17

S6(r) = h(u(x + r) − u(x))6i = h(∆u)6i ∼ r2hε(x)ε(x + r)i

(2)

Using Eqs. 1-2, one gets: h(∆u)6i ∼ r2−µ. Chambers and Antonia14 used this relatively

simple indirect approach and obtained µ ∼ 0.2 in the atmospheric surface layer. From ade-

quate statistical convergence standpoint, estimation of higher-order (speciﬁcally sixth-order

in this context) structure functions require very long time series.13 For instance, Cham-

bers and Antonia14 used several runs of 15 min duration at a hot wire sampling frequency

of ∼ 1.2 kHz (i.e., ∼ 1 million samples per series). On the other hand, 15-30 min sonic

anemometer-based ABL turbulence series would typically consist of only 20,000 to 40,000

samples. Understandably, the estimates of µ from sonic anemometer series using the tradi-

tional sixth-order structure function approach will not be very reliable. This and some other

theoretical considerations explained in the next section, motivate us to use an alternative es-

timation approach, called the magnitude cumulant analysis, recently introduced by Delour et

al.18. In this approach, only second-order magnitude cumulants (rather than data-intensive

sixth-order structure functions) are needed to estimate the intermittency coeﬃcient (µ).

The inter-related objectives of this paper are twofold:

(1) Assess the potential of the magnitude cumulant analysis in detecting and estimating

intermittency from short-length coarse-resolution (sonic anemometer-acquired) ABL

measurements; and

(2) Design a rigorous hypothesis-testing framework which would reduce the likelihood of

spurious detection of a non-zero µ from non-intermittent (monofractal) series.

The paper is structured as follows.

In Section II, we brieﬂy describe the magnitude

cumulant analysis technique. The Iterative Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT)

algorithm-based surrogate analysis, originally developed by the chaos theory community

for detection of nonlinearity in time series,19 is shown to be very robust and reliable for

intermittency hypothesis-testing. The IAAFT algorithm is presented in Section III. An

extensive collection of observational data from various ﬁeld campaigns is used in this study

3

and Section IV provides brief descriptions of these ﬁeld datasets. Comprehensive results of

intermittency estimation are presented in Section V and compared with published literature

wherever possible. Lastly, Section VI summarizes our results and discusses perspectives for

future research on the intriguing question of how atmospheric stability aﬀects intermittency

properties of boundary layer turbulence.

II. MAGNITUDE CUMULANT ANALYSIS

In the turbulence literature, the scaling exponent spectrum, ζq, is deﬁned as:

Sq(r) = h(∆u)qi ∼ rζq

(3)

where Sq(r) is the so-called q-th order structure function. As before, the angular bracket

denotes spatial averaging and r is a separation distance that varies within the inertial range.

If the scaling exponent ζq is a nonlinear function of q, then the ﬁeld is called ‘multifractal’,

otherwise it is termed ‘monofractal’.1,20 In the traditional structure function approach, esti-

mation of µ (= 2 − ζ6) requires a log-log plot of S6(r) vs r and subsequent extraction of the

slope using a least-squares linear regression ﬁt over a scaling regime (the inertial range). For

short time series, computation of S6(r) is problematic due to statistical convergence. More-

over, this problem is further compounded by the fact that even if the series is suﬃciently long

for statistical convergence of higher-order moments, the underlying nature of intermittency

might theoretically limit the range over which the equivalency of statistical and geometrical

interpretations of intermittency hold.21 As a result, even accurate estimates of higher-order

statistical moment will degenerate to a linear behavior of ζq for q larger than some qmax

prohibiting therefore an accurate estimation of intermittency using the structure function

approach (see Lashermes et al.21 for details). An alternative reliable method, ﬁrst advocated

by Delour et al.18, is to use the magnitude cumulant analysis. In this approach, the rela-

tionship between the moments of velocity increments (∆u) and the magnitude cumulants

(Cn) reads as:18,22

where

h|∆u|qi = exp(

Cn(r)

∞

Xn=1

)

C1(r) ≡ hln |∆u|i ∼ −c1 ln(r)

C2(r) ≡ h(ln |∆u|)2i − hln |∆u|i2 ∼ −c2 ln(r)

From Eqs. 3-5, it is straightforward to express the scaling exponent spectrum as:18

ζq = −

µ ≃ 9c2

Furthermore, by invoking a relationship between velocity increments (∆u) and local rate of

dissipation ﬁelds (ε) (similar to Eq. 2), one can arrive at:23

Therefore, estimation of the intermittency exponent µ would only require the computation

of second-order magnitude cumulant, i.e., the second central moment of ln|∆u| (Eq. 5b).

For large separation (r → Li, where Li is the integral length scale), it is well documented

that the probability distribution function (pdf) of velocity increments (∆u) approaches a

Gaussian distribution. For this scenario, the following results can be derived analytically:

C1(r) →

(−γ − ln(2)) = −0.64

1
2

C2(r) → π2/8 = 1.23

C3(r) → −

ζ(3) = −2.1

7
4

where γ is the Euler Gamma constant = 0.577216, and ζ(3) is Ap´ery’s constant = 1.2020569.

These asymptotic values of C1(r), C2(r), and C3(r) would be very useful to demarcate scaling

regions in the case of short-length time series.

It is noted that instead of a physical space-based magnitude cumulant analysis approach

(i.e, Eqs. 4-5), one could also use wavelet-based magnitude cumulant analysis (see Venugopal

et al.24,25 for a geophysical application). A wavelet-based approach becomes necessary for

nonstationary signals and signals with H¨older exponents (h) outside the window of [0 1].26,27

In turbulence, hhi is close to K41 value of 1/3 and to best of our knowledge always found

to be within the window of h ∈ [0 1].28,29 Thus, in the present study we decided to employ

physical space-based magnitude cumulant analysis approach.

Magnitude cumulant analysis of a synthetic fractional Brownian motion with h = 1/3

(which displays K41 like k−5/3 spectrum) is shown in Fig. 1. The dashed line in C1(r) vs.

ln(r) plot has the expected slope of 1/3. For almost the entire scaling range, both C2(r) and

5

C3(r) remain close to the theoretical Gaussian values of 1.23 and −2.1, respectively. This

signal does not show any sign of multifractality (expected) as the slope of C2(r) vs.

ln(r)

cannot be claimed to be diﬀerent from zero.

III. SURROGATE ANALYSIS

Noise is omnipresent in any measured signal and turbulence signals are no exceptions.

In addition to noise, limited amount of data (ﬁnite sample settings) in most ﬁeld mea-

surements could challenge intermittency detection and estimation even with the magnitude

cumulant analysis method (e.g., assessment of a small non-zero slope in the C2(r) vs. ln(r)

plots). In this paper, we utilize a hypothesis-testing framework, based on surrogate analysis,

in conjunction with magnitude cumulant analysis, for detecting and accurately estimating

intermittency from short-length sonic anemometer measurements.

The concept of surrogates (stochastic realizations which preserve only certain character-

istics of a process) was introduced into the chaos theory literature to provide a rigorous

statistical test for the null hypothesis that an observed time series has been generated by

a linear stochastic process (see Theiler et al.,30 Kantz and Schreiber,31 Basu and Foufoula-

Georgiou,32 and the references there in). Over the years, several varieties of surrogates

(randomly shuﬄed surrogates, Fourier phase randomized surrogates, iterative amplitude

adjusted Fourier transform - IAAFT surrogates, stochastic IAAFT surrogates, and so on)

have been proposed in the literature.33 In this paper, we will use the IAAFT algorithm pro-

posed by Schreiber and Schmitz.19 IAAFT surrogates preserve the correlation structure (thus

power spectrum owing to Wiener-Khinchin theorem) and the probability density function

of a given time series. Apart from nonlinearity detection,19,32 the IAAFT surrogates have

also been used to deﬁne a precipitation forecast quality index,34 and to generate synthetic

cloud ﬁelds.35

In the turbulence literature, surrogate analysis-based hypothesis-testing is virtually

nonexistent with an exception of the paper by Nikora et al.36 They used simple Fourier

phase randomization approach (pdf of the original turbulence series was not preserved) in

identifying the eﬀects of turbulence intermittency and spectral energy ﬂux. In comparison to

the Fourier phase randomized approach, the IAAFT algorithm used in the present study de-

signs stronger statistical test (owing to its ability to preserve the integral pdf of the original

signal) for the null hypothesis that an observed turbulence series is non-intermittent.

In Fig. 2, a sonic anemometer turbulence series and its IAAFT surrogate are shown.

By construction, they have the same pdf (bottom-right plot of Fig. 2) and virtually indis-

tinguishable autocorrelation function (bottom-left plot of Fig. 2). Basic properties of the

original turbulence series and its surrogate are provided in Table I. Ti and Li denote integral

time and length scales, respectively.

where R(τ ) is the autocorrelation function. From Fig. 2 and Table I, we can safely infer that

the IAAFT surrogate captures the integral pdf and autocorrelation function of the original

velocity series rather accurately. Later on, we will show that the IAAFT surrogates do not

7

have the ability to capture the scale-dependent pdfs of velocity increments and this forms

the basis for the proposed intermittency hypothesis-testing.

In this study, we primarily made use of an extensive atmospheric boundary layer tur-

bulence dataset (comprising of sonic anemometer measurements) collected by various re-

searchers from Johns Hopkins University, and the University of California-Davis during

Davis 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999 ﬁeld studies. Comprehensive description of these ﬁeld ex-

periments (e.g., surface cover, fetch, instrumentation, sampling frequency) can be found in

Pahlow et al.37 Brieﬂy, the collective attributes of the ﬁeld dataset explored in this study

are as follows: (i) surface cover: bare soil, and beans; (ii) sampling frequency: 18 to 21 Hz;

(iii) sampling period: 20 to 30 minutes; (iv) sensor height (z): 0.96 to 4.28 m.

The ABL ﬁeld measurements are seldom free from mesoscale disturbances, wave activities,

nonstationarities etc. The situation could be further aggravated by several kinds of sensor

errors (e.g., random spikes, amplitude resolution error, drop outs, discontinuities etc.). Thus,

stringent quality control and preprocessing of ﬁeld data is of utmost importance for any

rigorous statistical analysis. Our quality control and preprocessing strategies are described

in detail in Basu et al.38 After the quality control and preprocessing steps, we were left with

139 ‘reliable’ near-neutral (|z/L| ≤ 0.05, where z is the sensor height and L denotes the

Monin-Obukhov length) sets of runs for estimating the intermittency exponents.

We also estimated µ from a fast-response (10 kHz) hot wire ABL turbulence series utilizing

the magnitude cumulant analysis. The hot wire measurements were taken at the Surface

Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility located in the western

Utah Great Salt Lake desert under near-neutral atmospheric condition.15,16 In the following

section, we will show that the intermittency exponent and other relevant statistics derived

from this high Reynolds number (Re) hot wire measurement are surprisingly similar to

various published lower Re laboratory experimental ﬁndings, and serve as benchmarks in

the present study.

V. RESULTS

A. Analysis of Hot Wire Measurements

In this section, hot wire measurements and their surrogates are analyzed to: (a) demon-

strate the ability of the magnitude cumulant analysis to accurately estimate the intermit-

tency structure of turbulent velocity series, and (b) establish that the surrogate series, while

preserving the pdf and spectrum of the original data, destroy the intermittency structure.

In Fig. 3, the magnitude cumulants computed from the hot wire measurements of Kunkel

and Marusic16 are shown. This turbulence series is 30 min long (∼ 18 million data points)

and captures scales down to the Kolmogorov scale. The following observations can be made

from Fig. 3:

computed from the turbulence velocity signal is close to −0.36. It agrees quite

• cturb
1
well with the existing results from low Re laboratory experiments.18,22

• cturb
2

is approximately equal to 0.03. Delour et al.18 and Chevillard et al.22 reported

c2 = 0.025 ± 0.003 based on several experiments and claimed it to be ‘universal’.

From Eq. 7, we can compute the intermittency exponent µ ≃ 9 · cturb

2 ≃ 0.27.

In

the literature, researchers have reported µ ranging from 0.18 to 0.7.10,11 In the case of

atmospheric data, the ‘best’ direct estimate is 0.25±0.0510 and our indirect magnitude

cumulant analysis-based result is in agreement with it.

• From Eq. 6, we can derive: ζ turb

2 = −2 · cturb

1 − 2 · cturb

2 = 2 · 0.36 − 2 · 0.03 = 0.66. Fig. 3

(bottom-right) shows the second-order structure function. The slope of this plot gives

ζ turb
2 = 0.66. Thus, our results are self-consistent.

• In the inertial range, cturb

velocity increments are possibly log-normal.18,22

seems to be zero. This indicates that the statistics of the

has signiﬁcant practical implication. It insinuates

simple indirect method which does not require even second-order magnitude cumulant

computation would be quite useful.

• In the turbulence literature, there is a general consensus that ζ3 = 1. From our

results, we ﬁnd ζ turb

3 = −3 · cturb

1 − 9/2 · cturb

2 = 1.08 − 0.135 = 0.95, very close to the

well-accepted value.

We proceed further by comparing the pdf of the velocity and surrogate increments using

the skewness, asymmetry factor, and ﬂatness deﬁned as:

Skewness(r) =

Asymmetry(r) =

F latness(r) =

h(∆u)3i
h(∆u)2i3/2

h(∆u)3i
h|(∆u)3|i
h(∆u)4i
h(∆u)2i2

(10a)

(10b)

(10c)

From Fig. 4 (left), it is evident that the original turbulence increment series show negative

skewness (up to ∼ 0.6) for small scales in accord with the existing literature (e.g., Chevillard

et al.22). This negative skewness is believed to be related to the vortex folding and stretching

process. Mal´ecot et al.23 argued that the asymmetry factor (see Eq. 10 for deﬁnition) is

a better measure of the asymmetry of the pdf than the skewness. We found that both

of these signed odd-order moments behave quite similarly (Fig. 4, left). The origin of

spurious oscillations of these odd-order moments for large scales (ln(r/Li) > −4) is not well

understood. The ﬂatness plot (Figure 4, right) also portrays anticipated characteristics.

Flatness corresponding to the integral scale is close to 3 (hallmark of Gaussian velocity

increments) and becomes exceedingly large for smaller scales.

In contrast, the surrogate

shows Gaussian characteristics for all scales. This corroborates the fact that surrogates

cannot capture the pdfs of turbulence velocity increments.

B. Analysis of Sonic Anemometer Measurements

Magnitude cumulants and second-order structure functions computed from a sonic

anemometer series are shown in Fig. 5. The trends are very similar to Fig. 3, albeit

quite noisy. From this ﬁgure, we calculated c1 = −0.37, c2 = 0.06, and ζ2 = 0.63. We

would like to emphasize that even in this short time series scenario, we can reliably detect

intermittency with the help of IAAFT surrogate (see Fig. 5 top-right). Admittedly, the

estimation of c2 is possibly not very accurate. The estimation can be improved by using

quenched or annealed averaging strategy (discussed below).

It is quite diﬃcult to manually yet objectively select scaling ranges from a large dataset

(speciﬁcally 139 near-neutral turbulence series). So, we used an automated scaling range

of [4 · U/fs Li/2] for individual series. Here U, fs, and Li denote mean velocity, sampling

frequency, and integral length scale, respectively. From each individual turbulence series and

their surrogates, we calculated the corresponding c1 and c2 values. Subsequently, from these

139 cturb

combinations, we computed the best estimates (ensemble

mean plus/minus one standard deviation) as: hcturb

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

In this work, we have established a framework based on magnitude cumulant and surro-

gate analyses to reliably detect and estimate the intermittency coeﬃcient from short turbu-

lent time series. By virtue of this framework, ensemble scaling results extracted from a large

number of neutrally stratiﬁed atmospheric surface layer turbulent series (predominantly ac-

quired by slow response sonic anemometers) from various ﬁeld campaigns remarkably concur

with well-known published (mostly laboratory experimental) results.

The focus of the present study was on neutrally stratiﬁed atmospheric turbulence. How-

ever, it is widely known that neutral stability conditions are rarely encountered in the real

atmosphere. Most of the time, the atmospheric boundary layer is strongly modulated by

buoyancy. It is commonly assumed that the eﬀect of atmospheric stability is felt only at

the ‘buoyancy range’, which has scales considerably larger than the inertial range. Recently,

Aivalis et al.40 studied the intermittency behavior of temperature in the convective surface

layer using cold wire anemometry. They found that the classical inertial range remains in-

tact in convective surface layer and the scaling exponents approach values appropriate to

the intermittent case of isotropic turbulence. They also noticed that the scaling exponents

corresponding to the buoyancy range are highly anomalous. In contrast, Shi et al.41 found

that in the case of temperature, the inertial range scaling exponents are unambiguously

impacted by atmospheric stability. However, their results are inconclusive in the case of

velocity signals under diﬀerent stability regimes. We believe that the unresolved question

as to whether or not the inertial-range intermittency is inﬂuenced by large-scale anisotropic

forcing of atmospheric stability is of great consequence and needs further consideration.

Abundant high-quality slow response data collected under diﬀerent atmospheric regimes in

recent years (e.g., Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study - CASES9942) could be

coupled with the robust scaling analysis and estimation framework explored in this study in

This paper describes package natbib
version 7.4a from 2006/09/06.

Abstract

The natbib package is a reimplementation of the LATEX \cite command,
to work with both author–year and numerical citations. It is compatible with
the standard bibliographic style ﬁles, such as plain.bst, as well as with those
for harvard, apalike, chicago, astron, authordate, and of course natbib.
In contrast to the packages listed above, the natbib package supports not
only the various author–year bibliography styles, but also those for standard
numerical citations. In fact, it can also produce numerical citations even with
an author–year bibliographic style, something that permits easy switching
between the two citation modes. To this end, replacements for the standard
LATEX .bst ﬁles are also provided.

It is possible to deﬁne the citation style (type of brackets and punctuation
between citations) and even to associate it with the name of the bibliographic
style so that it is automatically activated. Citation styles can be deﬁned for
local .bst ﬁles by means of a conﬁguration ﬁle natbib.cfg.

It is compatible with the packages: babel, index, citeref, showkeys,
chapterbib, hyperref, koma and with the classes amsbook and amsart. It
can also emulate the sorting and compressing functions of the cite package
(with which it is otherwise incompatible).

Note that the citeref package (for adding citation page numbers in the
bibliography) must be loaded after natbib. (The hyperref package with the
option pagebackref also provides this feature, but with hyperlinks.)

The natbib package therefore acts as a single, ﬂexible interface for most

of the available bibliographic styles.

Introduction

The natbib package is an extension to LATEX to allow author–year citations along
with numerical citations. Standard LATEX permits only numerical, whereas all
extensions for author–year prior to the release of natbib in 1993 were limited
to just that. Since they normally added new commands (as does natbib too),
documents written with them could only be used with numerical citations after
extensive editing.

The natbib package has changed that; switching from author–year to numer-
ical citations is a matter of an option, with no alterations to the source text. It
has now become part of the standard LATEX installations, and is supported (de-
manded) by many journals. It is the citation package of choice by most of the
LATEX community, mainly because of its ﬂexibility and conﬁgurability.

Like all packages, it is loaded the document preamble, with possible options,

with, e.g.

\usepackage[sectionbib,square]{natbib}

The option sectionbib speciﬁes that, when used with the package chapterbib,
the bibliography will appear as a section at the end of each chapter (Section 2.14).
The square option says that references are to be enclosed in square bracket rather
than round parentheses. See Section 5 for a complete list of options.

The document text itself begins with, e.g.

\begin{document}
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}

which speciﬁes plainnat to be the bibliography style used by the BibTEX program
that generates the actual bibliography from a database. The style plainnat is
the natbib version of the standard plain (numerical only) style. See Section 2.1
for other styles, or search the installation for .bst ﬁles.

The \bibliographystyle command can be given anywhere in the document,
but it makes sense to add it at the start where it can be easily identiﬁed (and
modiﬁed).

To make a citation in the text, use

\citep{jon90} for a parenthetical citation (Jones et al., 1990),
\citet{jon90} for a textual one, as Jones et al. (1990).

Both \citep and \citet are deﬁned by natbib and are thus not standard. The
standard LATEX command \cite should be avoided, because it behaves like \citet
for author–year citations, but like \citep for numerical ones. There are many
other commands for other special eﬀects (Section 2.4).

In the above examples, jon90 is the identifying key for the reference, as found

in the BibTEX database, or in the thebibliography environment, Section 2.2:

\begin{thebibliography}{1}

\bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)]{jon90}
. . . . .

\end{thebibliography}

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

4

This environment prints the actual bibliography, and the \bibitem commands
link the entries to the citations via the key, here jon90. The key may be perfectly
arbitrary as long as it is unique. The text in square brackets contains the pieces
of citation information, the authors Jones et al. and the year 1990. Note that
these are two pieces of text that may be packaged together in several diﬀerent ways,
depending on the citation command. In fact, if numerical citations are selected,
they are (almost) ignored and only the sequence number is used as citation.

The thebibliography environment can be made by hand, but it is better and
safer to let BibTEX do it. For this, one needs the \bibliographystyle command
already mentioned, and near the end of the document:

\bibliography{mybib}
\end{document}

Here mybib is the root name of the BibTEX database ﬁle (mybib.bib) containing
the data for the references needed in the document.

The rest of this document presents all the gorey details about everything pos-

sible with natbib.

2 Using this Package

In this paper, I distinguish between the citation mode (author–year or numerical)
and citation style (the type of punctuation used for citations). The citation style
is something that is independent of the bibliography style and is not programmed
in the .bst ﬁles.

2.1 New Bibliography Styles

I provide three new .bst ﬁles to replace the standard LATEX numerical ones:

plainnat.bst

abbrvnat.bst

unsrtnat.bst

These produce reference lists in the same style as the corresponding standard
.bst ﬁle, but work with natbib. The advantage is that they can be used in both
numerical and author–year mode.

These .bst ﬁles are not meant to be exhaustive by any means. Other style ﬁles
conforming to the natbib format exist, or may be generated with my custom-bib
(also known as makebst) program.

2.2 The Syntax of the thebibliography

The information on the cited author names and year are given as part of the
\bibitem commands within the thebibliography environment. The natbib
package expects that information to be in a certain format, which is maintained
by the above bibliography styles. (It will also be able to interpret formats used
by some earlier packages, such as harvard and chicago.) If one wishes to bypass
BibTEX, one must make up the thebibliography oneself, such that it conforms
to natbib.

This syntax looks as follows:

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

5

\bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)]{jon90}...

or alternatively

\bibitem[Jones et al.(1990)Jones, Baker,

and Williams]{jon90}...

The text in square brackets contains the pieces of citation texts, the short author
list, Jones et al., the year 1990, and the optional long author list Jones, Baker
and Williams. If the long list is missing, the short list will be used instead. The
parentheses around the year are not part of the text, but merely delimit the year
from the author lists. Round parentheses must always be used, even if square
brackets are wanted for the citations. And there must be no space before or after
the year parentheses, else it will become part of the author list.

Note: if any single \bibitem entry does not conform to a syntax that natbib
understands, it switches stubbornly to numerical mode, since it otherwise has no
idea what the author and year texts could be.

2.3 Basic Citation Commands

\citet
\citep

The natbib package can be used with bibliography styles that were intended for
other, older packages, like harvard. However, the commands described in this and
the next sections are deﬁned by natbib and must be used even with those other
bibliography styles.

The natbib package has two basic citation commands, \citet and \citep
for textual and parenthetical citations, respectively. There also exist the starred
versions \citet* and \citep* that print the full author list, and not just the
abbreviated one. All of these may take one or two optional arguments to add
some text before and after the citation.

\citet{jon90}
\citet[chap.~2]{jon90}
\citep{jon90}
\citep[chap.~2]{jon90}
\citep[see][]{jon90}
\citep[see][chap.~2]{jon90} ⇒ (see Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
\citet*{jon90}
\citep*{jon90}

⇒ Jones et al. (1990)
⇒ Jones et al. (1990, chap. 2)
⇒ (Jones et al., 1990)
⇒ (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)
⇒ (see Jones et al., 1990)

⇒ Jones, Baker, and Williams (1990)
⇒ (Jones, Baker, and Williams, 1990)

The starred versions can only list the full authors if the .bst ﬁle supports this
feature; otherwise, the abbreviated list is printed.

In standard LATEX, the \cite command can only take a single optional text
for a note after the citation; here, a single optional text is a post-note, while two
are the pre- and post-notes. To have only a pre-note, it is necessary to provide an
empty post-note text, as shown above.

More complex mixtures of text and citations can be generated with the all-

purpose \citetext command in Section 2.4.

Multiple citations may be made by including more than one citation key in the
\cite command argument. If adjacent citations have the same author designation
but diﬀerent years, then the author names are not reprinted.

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

\citet{jon90,jam91} ⇒ Jones et al. (1990); James et al. (1991)
\citep{jon90,jam91} ⇒ (Jones et al., 1990; James et al. 1991)
\citep{jon90,jon91} ⇒ (Jones et al., 1990, 1991)
\citep{jon90a,jon90b} ⇒ (Jones et al., 1990a,b)

These examples are for author–year citation mode. In numerical mode, the

results are diﬀerent.

\citet{jon90}
\citet[chap.~2]{jon90}
\citep{jon90}
\citep[chap.~2]{jon90}

⇒ Jones et al. [21, chap. 2]
⇒ [21]
⇒ [21, chap. 2]
⇒ [see 21]

⇒ [21, 32]

\cite

The authors can only be listed if the .bst ﬁle supports author–year citations.
The standard .bst ﬁles, such as plain.bst are numerical only and transfer no
author–year information to LATEX. In this case, \citet prints “(author?) [21].”
In the original versions of natbib, the traditional \cite command was used
for both textual and parenthetical citations. The presence of an empty optional
text in square brackets signalled parenthetical. This syntax has been retained for
compatibility, but is no longer encouraged.

This means that \cite (without notes) is the same as \citet in author–year
mode, whereas in numerical mode, it is the same as \citep. The starred version,
as well as the one or two optional notes, may also be used.

It is possible to have multiple citations sorted into the same sequence as they
appear in the list of references, regardless of their order as arguments to the \cite
commands. The option sort is required for this feature. See Section 2.15.

Some publishers require that the ﬁrst citation of any given reference be given
with the full author list, but that all subsequent ones with the abbreviated list.
Include the option longnamesfirst to enable this for natbib. See Section 2.16.

2.4 Extended Citation Commands

\citealt
\citealp
\citetext

As an alternative form of citation, \citealt is the same as \citet but with-
out parentheses. Similarly, \citealp is \citep without parentheses. Multiple
references, notes, and the starred variants also exist.

\citealt{jon90}
\citealt*{jon90}
\citealp{jon90}
\citealp*{jon90}
\citealp{jon90,jam91} ⇒ Jones et al., 1990; James et al., 1991
\citealp[pg.~32]{jon90} ⇒ Jones et al., 1990, pg. 32
\citetext{priv.\ comm.} ⇒ (priv. comm.)

⇒ Jones et al. 1990
⇒ Jones, Baker, and Williams 1990
⇒ Jones et al., 1990
⇒ Jones, Baker, and Williams, 1990

The \citetext command allows arbitrary text to be placed in the current citation
parentheses. This may be used in combination with \citealp. For example,

\citetext{see \citealp{jon90},

or even better \citealp{jam91}}

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

7

\citeauthor
\citeyear
\citeyearpar
\citefullauthor

to produce (see Jones et al., 1990, or even better James et al., 1991).

In author–year schemes, it is sometimes desirable to be able to refer to the
authors without the year, or vice versa. This is provided with the extra commands

\citeauthor{jon90} ⇒ Jones et al.
\citeauthor*{jon90} ⇒ Jones, Baker, and Williams
\citeyear{jon90}
⇒ 1990
\citeyearpar{jon90} ⇒ (1990)

There also exists a command \citefullauthor which is equivalent to \citeauthor*.
If the full author information is missing, then \citeauthor* is the same as
\citeauthor, printing only the abbreviated list. This also applies to the starred
versions of \citet and \citep.

If the author or year information is missing (as is the case with the standard

LATEX .bst ﬁles), these commands issue a warning.
Note: these commands may also be used with numerical citations, provided an
author–year .bst ﬁle is being employed.

Note: all \cite.. commands have the same syntax, allowing multiple citations
and up to two notes (there is, however, no starred \citeyear variant). It does not
really make much sense to add notes to \citeyear and \citeauthor, especially
with multiple citations; however, this can be done, there will be no error message,
but the results are sometimes strange. For example, in numerical mode, the
notes are fully ignored, while in author–year mode, only the post-note is accepted.
Multiple citations in \citet are also not recommended (nor are they in my opinion
meaningful), but if they are used with notes, the pre-note will appear before each
year, and the post-note only after the last year. These are admittedly bugs, but
the eﬀort to remove them is not justiﬁed by the questionable usefulness of these
features.

In summary, notes are only intended for \citep but they may also be used
with \citet in author–year mode, with single citations. In any other situation,
the results are unpredictable.

2.5 Forcing Upper Cased Name

If the ﬁrst author’s name contains a von part, such as “della Robbia”, then
\citet{dRob98} produces “della Robbia (1998)”, even at the beginning of a sen-
tence. One can force the ﬁrst letter to be in upper case with the command \Citet
instead. Other upper case commands also exist.

when
then

\citet{dRob98}
\Citet{dRob98}
\Citep{dRob98}
\Citealt{dRob98}
\Citealp{dRob98}
\Citeauthor{dRob98} ⇒ Della Robbia

⇒ della Robbia (1998)
⇒ Della Robbia (1998)
⇒ (Della Robbia, 1998)
⇒ Della Robbia 1998
⇒ Della Robbia, 1998

These commands also exist in starred versions for full author names.

Note: the coding for the upper casing commands is tricky and likely buggy. It
operates on the names that are stored in the \bibitem entry, and works even if

\Citet
\Citep
\Citealt
\Citealp
\Citeauthor

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

8

old style font commands are used; however, LATEX 2ε commands will cause it to
crash. Thus

\bibitem[{\it della Robbia}(1998)]{dRob98}
\bibitem[\textit{della Robbia}(1998)]{dRob98}

is okay, but
crashes.

2.6 Citation Aliasing

\defcitealias
\citetalias
\citepalias

Sometimes one wants to refer to a reference with a special designation, rather than
by the authors, i.e. as Paper I, Paper II. Such aliases can be deﬁned and used,
textual and/or parenthetical with:

\defcitealias{jon90}{Paper~I}
\citetalias{jon90}
\citepalias{jon90}

⇒ Paper I
⇒ (Paper I)

These citation commands function much like \citet and \citep: they may take
multiple keys in the argument, may contain notes, and are marked as hyperlinks.
A warning is issued if the alias is used before it is deﬁned, or if an alias is
redeﬁned for a given citation. No warning is issued if an alias is deﬁned for a
citation key that does not exist; the warning comes when it is used!

See Section 2.7 for an alternative means of citing with a code name.

2.7 Authorless and Yearless References

What does one do about references that do not have authors? This has long
bothered me but I do have a suggestion. Standard BibTEX styles make use of a
KEY ﬁeld in the entries to be used for alphabetizing when the authors or editors
are missing. The author–year styles go even further and insert the KEY ﬁeld in
place of the authors. One can imagine giving a code designation for the work at
this point. For example,

@MANUAL{handbk98,

title = {Assembling Computers},
year = 1998,
organization = {MacroHard Inc.},
key = "MH-MAN"

}

With plain, the key text MH-MAN is used only to order the reference, but
with plainnat and other author–year styles, it is used in place of the authors.
One can then refer to it as \citeauthor{handbk98} to get MH-MAN or as
\citetext{\citeauthor{handbk98}} for (MH-MAN), a parenthetical citation.

This can be greatly simpliﬁed if the bibliography style leaves the date blank in

the \bibitem entry, as

\bibitem[MH-MAN()]{handbk98}

for then natbib suppresses the date, preceding punctuation, and the braces for
\citet. This means that \citet and \citep behave automatically like the two
examples above. The date still may appear in the text of the reference.

The natbib bibliography styles have been modiﬁed accordingly to omit the
date from the \bibitem entry when missing authors and/or editors are replaced
by key text.

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

9

Similarly, if the year is missing, it will be left blank in the \bibitem entry;

thus citing such a work will only produce the authors’ names.

Note: there are many other possibilities with this feature. One can even produce
citations like those of the alpha bibliography style, by placing the citation code
in place of the authors in the \bibitem entry and leaving the year blank. A
second code (or maybe even the authors themselves) could be placed where the
full author list normally appears, to be printed with the starred version of the
\cite commands. For example,

\bibitem[MH-MAN()MacroHard Inc.]{handbk98}

2.8 Extra Features in the plainnat Family

The special .bst ﬁles for natbib mentioned in Section 2.1 have a number of extra
ﬁelds compared to the original ﬁles:

ISBN
ISSN
URL
DOI

EID

for the ISBN number in books,
for the ISSN number in periodicals,
for the Internet address of online documents,
the Digital Object Identiﬁer now being used by many journals as a
more robust alternative to URL,
electronic ID, a substitute for page numbers for online journals that
also appear in print; also known as the sequence number within the
paper volume.

Both the DOI and URL tend to be very long, causing ugly line breaks or
sticking out into the margin. This can be avoided by loading the url package by
Donald Arseneau, which allows text to be broken at punctuation marks without a
hyphen. This package is automatically detected by natbib and appropriate com-
mands redeﬁned. URLs are printed in typewriter font, DOI in roman. Without
the url package, these numbers are never broken.

As pointed out in Section 2.7, the KEY ﬁeld is treated diﬀerently by plainnat
than in plain. Whereas the latter uses this ﬁeld only to alphabetize entries
without authors, plainnat actually inserts it in place of the author, both in the
reference text and in the citation label (\bibitem entries). Furthermore, the year
is left empty in \bibitem so that \citep prints only the “author” text, which is
now the KEY. This should be some code designation for the work.

2.9 Selecting Citation Punctuation

\bibpunct

The above examples have been printed with the default citation style. It is possible
to change this, as well as to select numerical or author–year mode, by means of
the \bibpunct command, which takes one optional and 6 mandatory arguments.
The mandatory ones are:

1. the opening bracket symbol, default = (

2. the closing bracket symbol, default = )

3. the punctuation between multiple citations, default = ;

4. the letter ‘n’ for numerical style, or ‘s’ for numerical superscript style, any
other letter for author–year, default = author–year; note, it is not necessary
to specify which author–year interface is being used, for all will be recognized;

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

10

5. the punctuation that comes between the author names and the year (paren-

thetical case only), default = ,

6. the punctuation that comes between years or numbers when common author
lists are suppressed (default = ,); if both authors and years are common, the
citation is printed as ‘1994a,b’, but if a space is wanted between the extra
letters, then include the space in the argument, as {,~}.

For numerical mode, \citet{jon90,jon91} produces ‘Jones et al. [21, 22]’
with this punctuation between the numbers. A space is automatically in-
cluded for numbers, but not for superscripts.

The optional argument is the character preceding a post-note, default is a
comma plus space. In redeﬁning this character, one must include a space if one is
wanted.

The \bibpunct command must be issued in the preamble, that is, before

\begin{document}.

Example 1, \bibpunct{[}{]}{,}{a}{}{;} changes the output of

\citep{jon90,jon91,jam92}

into [Jones et al. 1990; 1991, James et al. 1992].

Example 2, \bibpunct[; ]{(}{)}{,}{a}{}{;} changes the output of

\citep[and references therein]{jon90}

into (Jones et al. 1990; and references therein).

Usually the citation style is determined by the journal for which one is writ-
ing, and is as much a part of the bibliography style as everything else. The
natbib package allows punctuation deﬁnitions to be directly coupled to the
\bibliographystyle command that must always be present when BibTEX is
used. It is this command that selects the .bst ﬁle; by adding such a coupling
to natbib for every .bst ﬁle that one might want to use, it is not necessary to
add \bibpunct explicitly in the document itself, unless of course one wishes to
override the preset values.

Such a coupling is achieved by deﬁning a command \bibstyle@bst, where bst
stands for the name of the .bst ﬁle. For example, the American Geophysical
Union (AGU) demands in its publications that citations be made with square
brackets and separated by semi-colons. I have an agu.bst ﬁle to accomplish most
of the formatting, but such punctuations are not included in it. Instead, natbib
has the deﬁnition

\newcommand{\bibstyle@agu}{\bibpunct{[}{]}{;}{a}{,}{,~}}

These style deﬁning commands may contain more than just \bibpunct. Some
numerical citation scheme require even more changes. For example, the journal
Nature not only uses superscripted numbers for citations, it also prints the num-
bers in the list of references without the normal square brackets. To accommodate
this, natbib contains the style deﬁnition

\newcommand{\bibstyle@nature}%

{\bibpunct{}{}{,}{s}{}{\textsuperscript{,}}%

\gdef\NAT@biblabelnum##1{##1.}}

\bibstyle@xxx

\citestyle

A preprogrammed citation style is normally invoked by the command \bibliographystyle,

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

11

The redeﬁned \NAT@biblabelnum command speciﬁes how the reference numbers
are to be formatted in the list of references itself. The redeﬁnition must be made
with \gdef, not \def or \renewcommand.

The selected punctuation style and other redeﬁnitions will not be in eﬀect on
the ﬁrst LATEX run, for they are stored to the auxiliary ﬁle for the subsequent run.
The user may add more such deﬁnitions of his own, to accommodate those jour-
nals and .bst ﬁles that he has. He should put them into a ﬁle named natbib.cfg,
which is read in if it exists, adding any local conﬁgurations. Thus such conﬁgura-
tions can survive future updates of the package.

Note: any explicit call to \bibpunct has priority over the predeﬁned citation
styles.

as described above. However, it may be that one wants to apply a certain citation
style to another bibliography style. This may be done with \citestyle, given
before \begin{document}. For example, to use the plainnat bibliography style
(for the list of references) with the Nature style of citations (superscripts),

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{natbib}
. . . . .
\citestyle{nature}
\begin{document}
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
. . . . .

Note: all changes to the citation style, including punctuation, must be made
before \begin{document}, which freezes the citation style.

2.10 Priority of Style Commands

The citation style (punctuation and mode) can be selected by means of the
\bibpunct, \citestyle, and predeﬁned \bibstyle@bst commands. They can
also be selected by package options (Section 5). What happens if there are several
conﬂicting selections?

The lowest priority is assigned to the predeﬁned \bibstyle@bst commands,
since they are implicit and not obvious to the user. The package options have the
next priority. Finally, any selection by \bibpunct and/or \citestyle overrides
those of the other methods.

2.11 Other Formatting Options

\bibsection

\bibpreamble

The list of references normally appears as a \section* or \chapter*, depending
If one wants to redesign one’s own heading, say as a num-
on the main class.
bered section with \section, then \bibsection may be redeﬁned by the user
accordingly.

A preamble appearing after the \bibsection heading may be inserted before
the actual list of references by deﬁning \bibpreamble. This will appear in the
normal text font unless it contains font declarations. The \bibfont applies to the
list of references, not to this preamble.

\bibfont

The list of references is normally printed in the same font size and style as the

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

12

main body. However, it is possible to deﬁne \bibfont to be font commands that
are in eﬀect within the thebibliography environment after any preamble. For
example,

\newcommand{\bibfont}{\small}

\citenumfont

Numerical citations may be printed in a diﬀerent font. Deﬁne \citenumfont
to be a font declaration like \itshape or even a command taking arguments like
\textit.

\newcommand{\citenumfont}[1]{\textit{#1}}

The above is better than \itshape since it automatically adds italic correction.

\bibnumfmt

The format of the numerical listing in the reference list may also be changed

from the default [32] by redeﬁning \bibnumfmt, for example

\renewcommand{\bibnumfmt}[1]{\textbf{#1}:}

to achieve 32: instead.

\bibhang

\bibsep

The list of references for author–year styles uses a hanging indentation format:
the ﬁrst line of each reference is ﬂush left, the following lines are set with an
indentation from the left margin. This indentation is 1 em by default but may be
changed by redeﬁning (with \setlength) the length parameter \bibhang.

The vertical spacing between references in the list, whether author–year or
numerical, is controlled by the length \bibsep. If this is set to 0 pt, there is no
extra line spacing between references. The default spacing depends on the font
size selected in \documentclass, and is almost a full blank line. Change this by
redeﬁning \bibsep with \setlength command.

\citeindextrue
\citeindexfalse

\NAT@idxtxt

\citeindextype

2.12 Automatic Indexing of Citations

If one wishes to have the citations entered in the .idx indexing ﬁle, it is only
necessary to issue \citeindextrue at any point in the document. All following
\cite commands, of all variations, then insert the corresponding entry to that
ﬁle. With \citeindexfalse, these entries will no longer be made.

The \bibitem commands in the thebibliography environment will also
If this is not desired, then issue \citeindexfalse before

make index entries.
\bibliography or \begin{thebibliography}.

Of course, \makeindex must also be issued in the preamble to activate indexing,

as usual. Otherwise, no indexing is done at all.

Make sure that the document has been processed at least twice after the last

BibTEX run before running the makeindex program.

The form of the index entries is set by the internal \NAT@idxtxt, which can
be redeﬁned by hackers if wanted (in the natbib.cfg ﬁle please). By default, it
prints the short author list plus date in the current parenthesis style.

The natbib package can also be used with the index package of David M.

Jones. The order in which the packages are loaded is not important.

In that package, multiple index lists may be made by means of a \newindex
command. For example, it may be desirable to put all the citation indexing into
a separate list. First that list must be initiated with, e.g.,

\newindex{cite}{ctx}{cnd}{List of Citations}

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

13

and then the automatic citation indexing associated with this list with the natbib
command

\renewcommand{\citeindextype}{cite}

See the documentation for index.sty for details.

2.13 HyperTEX Compatibility
The natbib package is compatible with the hyperref package of Sebastian Rahtz
, for use with LATEX → HTML conversions, pdfTEX, pdfmark. The compatibility
is of a mutual nature: both packages contain coding that interact with that of the
other.

There is a special option nonamebreak that can be used with the hyperref
package; it keeps all the author names in a citation on one line, something that
avoids certain problems with pdfTEX. This is otherwise not recommended, since
many overfull lines result.

2.14 Multiple Bibliographies in One Document

The natbib package is compatible with the chapterbib package of Donald Arse-
neau and Niel Kempson,1 which makes it possible to have several bibliographies
in one document. The usual application is to have bibliographies in each chapter
of a book, especially if they have been written by diﬀerent authors.

The chapterbib package works in a very natural way for the author; only the
editor who puts all the chapters together into one book has to do some extra work.
The package makes use of the \include command, and each \included ﬁle has
its own bibliography. For large books, it makes very good sense to take advantage
of this feature in any case.

To review the use of \include, recall that the main ﬁle

\documentclass{...}
\includeonly{ch2}
\begin{document}
\include{ch1}
\include{ch2}
\include{ch3}

\end{document}

will process only the ﬁle ch2.tex as though the ﬁles ch1.tex and ch3.tex were
also present. That is, all counters, especially the page and section numbers, as
well as cross-referencing deﬁnitions, will function as if the whole document were
processed. The trick is that each \included ﬁle has it own .aux ﬁle containing
these deﬁnitions, and they are all read in every time, even if the corresponding
.tex ﬁle is not. The .aux ﬁles also contain the citation information for BibTEX,
something that the chapterbib package exploits.

If \usepackage{chapterbib} has been given, the keys in each \cite and
\bibitem command are associated with the current \included ﬁle and are dis-
tinguished from the identical key in a diﬀerent ﬁle. Each of these ﬁles must con-
tain its own \bibliography and \bibliographystyle commands. One processes
BibTEX on each ﬁle separately before processing it under LATEX (at least twice).

1I have used version 1.5 from 1995/10/09; cannot guarantee earlier versions.

2.14.1 Special Considerations for natbib and chapterbib

The order in which the chapterbib and natbib packages are loaded is unimpor-
tant.

The chapterbib package provides an option sectionbib that puts the bib-
liography in a \section* instead of \chapter*, something that makes sense if
there is a bibliography in each chapter. This option will not work when natbib
is also loaded; instead, add the option to natbib. (The sectionbib option can
always be given, but it only has meaning for the book and report classes, or for
classes derived from them.)

Every \included ﬁle must contain its own \bibliography command where the
bibliography is to appear. The database ﬁles listed as arguments to this command
can be diﬀerent in each ﬁle, of course. However, what is not so obvious, is that
each ﬁle must also contain a \bibliographystyle command, preferably with the
same style argument. If diﬀerent bibliography styles are speciﬁed for diﬀerent ﬁles,
then the preprogrammed citation style (punctuation and citation mode) will be
that of the ﬁrst bibliography style given. The preprogrammed citation styles can
only be changed in the preamble (see Section 2.10), something that guarantees a
uniform style for the entire document.2

2.15 Sorting and Compressing Numerical Citations

Another package by Donald Arseneau, cite.sty, reimplements the entire (nu-
merical) citation system such that one can control the punctuation and citation
format, all of which is done by natbib as well. However, it also can sort and
compress numerical citations, something that is required by some journals.

What this means is that when multiple citations are given with a single \cite
command, the normal order of the numbers is in the sequence given. This is
usually a wild list of numbers, such as [4,2,8,3]. With the cite package, this list
becomes [2–4,8].

It is impossible to make the cite and natbib packages compatible, since both
reimplement \cite from scratch. Instead, I have taken over some of the coding
from cite.sty, modifying it for natbib. This coding is activated by including
one of the options sort or sort&compress in the \usepackage command.

For author–year citations, the option sort orders the citations in a single
\citep or \citet command into the sequence in which they appear in the list of
references. This is normally alphabetical ﬁrst, year second. This should avoid
citations of the type: “James et al. (1994b,a)”. For author–year mode, the
sort&compress option is identical to sort.

2.16 Long Author List on First Citation

A feature that has often been requested by otherwise happy users of natbib is one
that is found in the harvard package as standard: with the ﬁrst citation of any
reference, the full author list is printed, and afterwards only the abbreviated list.
One can control this with \citet* for the ﬁrst citation, and \citet or \citep
thereafter. However, the automatic feature is very desired.
This can be activated with the option longnamesfirst.

2It would be relatively easy to allow changes in style anywhere in the document, but this

strikes me as bad policy. However, it is provided for with the docstrip option nopreonly.

\shortcites

Some references have so many authors that you want to suppress the automatic

long list only for them. In this case, issue

\shortcites{hkey-list i}

before the ﬁrst citations, and those included in key-list will have a short list on
their ﬁrst citation.

Full author lists can still be forced at any time with the starred variants.

3 Numerical Citations with Author–Year Styles

It is possible to produce numerical citations with any author-year .bst ﬁle, with
minimal change to the text. The commands \citet and \citep will produce
sensible results in both modes, without any special editing. Obviously, the opposite
is not possible; a .bst ﬁle intended for numerical citation can never produce
author–year citations, simply because the information is not transferred to the
auxiliary ﬁle.

3.1 Selecting Numerical Mode

By default, natbib is in author–year mode. This can be changed by

1. selecting a numerical bibliography style with predeﬁned citation style, de-

ﬁned either in the package or in the local conﬁguration ﬁle;

2. giving options numbers or super to the \usepackage command;

3. issuing \bibpunct with the 4th mandatory argument set to n or s;

4. issuing \citestyle with the name of a predeﬁned numerical bibliography

style.

The methods are listed in order of increasing priority.

The natbib package will automatically switch to numerical mode if any one of
the \bibitem entries fails to conform to the possible author–year formats. There is
no way to override this, since such an entry would cause trouble in the author–year
mode.

There are certain special ‘numerical’ styles, like that of the standard alpha.bst,

which include a non-numerical label in place of the number, in the form

\bibitem[ABC95]{able95}

As far as natbib is concerned, this label does not conform to the author–year pos-
sibilities and is therefore considered to be numerical. The citation mode switches
to numerical, and \cite{able95} prints [ABC95].

See however, the end of Section 2.7 for another possibility. The above result

can be achieved with

\bibitem[ABC95()]{able95}

4 Local Conﬁguration

It is possible to add a local conﬁguration ﬁle natbib.cfg, which is read in, if it
exists, at the end of the package. It may thus contain coding to supecede that
in the package, although its main purpose is to allow the user to add his own
\bibstyle@bst deﬁnitions to couple citation punctuation with local bibliography
styles.

5 Package Options

When a package is loaded with \usepackage, one can add options to select diﬀer-
ent features, as

\usepackage[options]{natbib}

The options available provide another means of specifying the punctuation for
citations:

round (default) for round parentheses;

square for square brackets;

curly for curly braces;

angle for angle brackets;

colon (default) to separate multiple citations with colons;

comma to use commas as separaters;

authoryear (default) for author–year citations;

numbers for numerical citations;

super for superscripted numerical citations, as in Nature;

sort orders multiple citations into the sequence in which they appear in the list

of references;

sort&compress as sort but in addition multiple numerical citations are com-

pressed if possible (as 3–6, 15);

compress to compress without sorting, so compression only occurs when the given

citations would produce an ascending sequence of numbers;

longnamesfirst makes the ﬁrst citation of any reference the equivalent of the
starred variant (full author list) and subsequent citations normal (abbrevi-
ated list);

sectionbib redeﬁnes \thebibliography to issue \section* instead of \chapter*;

valid only for classes with a \chapter command; to be used with the
chapterbib package;

nonamebreak keeps all the authors’ names in a citation on one line; causes overfull

hboxes but helps with some hyperref problems.

If any of the formatting options are selected, the predeﬁned citation styles in
the commands \bibstyle@bst will be no longer be eﬀective. If either \bibpunct
or \citestyle is given in the preamble, the above punctuation options will no
longer hold.

6 Reference Sheet

A summary of the main points on using natbib can be obtained by LATEXing the
ﬁle natnotes.tex, which is extracted from the main source ﬁle natbib.dtx with
the docstrip option notes. This is intended to act as a handy reference sheet.

This ﬁle should be extracted automatically by the supplied installation ﬁle,

natbib.ins.

7 Options with docstrip

The source .dtx ﬁle is meant to be processed with docstrip, for which a number
of options are available:

all includes all of the other interfaces;

apalike allows interpretation of minimal apalike form of \bibitem;

newapa allows \citeauthoryear to be in the optional argument of \bibitem

along with the punctuation commands of newapa.sty;

chicago is the same as newapa;

harvard includes interpretation of \harvarditem;

astron allows \astroncite to appear in the optional argument of \bibitem;

authordate adds the syntax of the \citename command.

The remaining options are:

package to produce a .sty package ﬁle with most comments removed;
209 (obsolete) to generate a LATEX 2.09 version of the package; this is no longer

supported and will likely not work properly;

notes extracts a summary of usage to be used as a reference sheet; the resulting

ﬁle is to be LATEXed;

nopreonly allows \citestyle and \bibpunct to be called anywhere in the text;
this is considered possibly useful with the chapterbib package where dif-
ferent chapters might have diﬀerent bibliography and citation styles; is only
provided in case I change my mind about this feature, but for now I refuse
to implement it;

driver to produce a driver .drv ﬁle that will print out the documentation when
LATEX’d. This ﬁle can be modiﬁed to produce various alternatives (page size,
fonts, manual only, or with annotated code). The natbib.dtx ﬁle is itself
such a driver but it should never, ever be edited by a user.

The source ﬁle natbib.dtx is itself a driver ﬁle and can be processed directly by
LATEX 2ε.

8 Other Author–Year Solutions

This section is of historical interest only.

Before natbib was published in 1993, there were several other attempts to
provide author–year citations, some of which inspired natbib. A few of these are
still maintained and used, and for that reason, natbib has attempted to include
their \bibitem syntaxes, to be compatible with those .bst ﬁles.

Most of these ‘packages’ are really LATEX 2.09 style ﬁles, so do not have features

available with the modern LATEX 2ε.

8.1 The natsci.bst Style

What gave me my ﬁrst inspiration was Stephen Gildea’s natsci.bst for use with
his agujgr.sty ﬁle. This showed me that the problem was solvable. However,
Gildea’s formats \bibitem with just the abbreviated authors and year. Thus only
parenthetical citations can be accommodated.

The name natsci stands for natural sciences, and it was this that led to the
name natbib. (This is admittedly an ugly name, but it is now established and
cannot be changed so easily.)

8.2 The apalike.bst Style
Oren Patashnik, the originator of BibTEX and the standard .bst ﬁles, has
also worked on an author–year style, called apalike.bst with a corresponding
apalike.sty to support it. Again, only the parenthetical citation is provided. Its
functionality is identical to that of the natsci ﬁles.

The form of the thebibliography entries in this system is

\bibitem[Jones et al., 1990]{jon90}...

This is the most minimal form that can be given. I name it the apalike variant,
after Patashnik’s apalike.bst and apalike.sty. However, there could be many
independent .bst ﬁles that follow this line, such as the natsci styles.

The bibliography style ﬁles belonging to this group include:

apalike, apalike2, cea, cell, jmb, phapalik, phppcf, phrmp

8.3 The newapa Style

A major improvement was achieved with newapa.bst and the accompanying
newapa.sty ﬁles by Stephen N. Spencer and Young U. Ryu. Under their sys-
tem, three separate items of information are included in the \bibitem label, to
be used as required. These are: the full author list, the abbreviated list, and the
year. This is accomplished by means of a \citeauthoryear command included
in the label, as

\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Jones, Barker,
and Williams}{Jones et al.}{1990}]{jon90}...

Actually, this only illustrates the basic structure of \citeauthoryear; the newapa
ﬁles go even further to replace some words and punctuation with commands. For

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

19

example, the word ‘and’ above is really \betweenauthors, something that must
be deﬁned in the .sty ﬁle. Of course, \citeauthoryear is also deﬁned in that
ﬁle. A number of diﬀerent \cite commands are available to print out the citation
with complete author list, with the short list, with or without the date, the textual
or parenthetical form.

Thus the \citeauthoryear entry in \bibitem is very ﬂexible, permitting the
style ﬁle to generate every citation form that one might want.
It is used by a
number of other styles, with corresponding .sty ﬁles. They all appear to have been
inspired by newapa.bst, although they lack the extra punctuation commands.

Bibliographic style ﬁles belonging to the newapa group include

newapa, chicago, chicagoa, jas99, named

Note: the last of these, named.bst, uses \citeauthoryear in a slightly diﬀerent
manner, with only two arguments: the short list and year.

8.4 The Harvard Family

The same eﬀect is achieved by a diﬀerent approach in the Harvard family of
bibliographic styles. Here a substitute for \bibitem is used, as

\harvarditem[Jones et al.]{Jones, Baker, and

Williams}{1990}{jon90}...

The accompanying interface package ﬁle is called harvard.sty and is written
It deﬁnes \harvarditem as well as
by Peter Williams and Thorsten Schnier.
the citation commands \cite, for parenthentical, and \citeasnoun, for textual
citations. The ﬁrst citation uses the long author list, following ones the shorter
list, if it has been given in the optional argument to \harvarditem.

Bibliography styles belonging to the Harvard family are

agsm, dcu, kluwer

This package has been updated for LATEX 2ε, with many additions to add ﬂex-
ibility. The result is a powerful interface that should meet most citation needs.
(It does not suppress repeated authors, though, as natbib does.)

8.5 The Astronomy Style

Apparently realizing the limitations of his apalike system, Oren Patashnik went
on to develop a ‘true’ apa bibliographic style, making use of the method already
employed by an astronomy journal. This is actually very similar to the newapa
label but with only the short list of authors:

\bibitem[\protect\astroncite{Jones et al.}{1990}]{jon90}

...

It requires the package ﬁle astron.sty or any other style that deﬁnes \astroncite
appropriately.

Bibliographic styles belonging to the astronomy group are

apa, astron, bbs, cbe, humanbio, humannat, jtb

This is as good as the \citeauthoryear command, although not as ﬂexible

since the full list of authors is missing.

NATURAL SCIENCES CITATIONS AND REFERENCES

8.6 The authordate Style

Finally, I also found some packages making use of a label command called
\citename in the form

\bibitem[\protect\citename{Jones et al., }1990]{jon90}

...

This is not a good system since the author list and date are not cleanly sepa-
rated as individual arguments, and since the punctuation is included in the label
text. It is better to keep the punctuation fully removed, as part of the deﬁnitions
in the .sty ﬁle, for complete ﬂexibility.

Bibliographic styles belonging to this group are

authordate1, authordate2, authordate3, authordate4, aaai-named

with accompanying style ﬁle authordate1-4.sty.

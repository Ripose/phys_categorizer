Abstract: Collisional eﬀects are included in the path-integral formulation
that was proposed in one of our previous paper for the collisionless Boltz-
mann gas. In calculating the number of molecules entering a six-dimensional
phase volume element due to collisions, both the colliding molecules and the
scattered molecules are allowed to have distributions; thus the calculation
is done smoothly and no singularities arise.

Introduction

In our previous works, we proposed a path-integral approach to the col-
lisionless Boltzmann gas[1][2].
It is assumed in the approach that there
are continuous and discontinuous distribution functions in realistic Boltz-
mann gases: continuous distribution functions are produced by continuous
distribution functions that exist previously and discontinuous distribution
functions are caused by boundary eﬀects. (Boundaries can block and reﬂect
molecules in such a way that distribution functions become discontinuous in
the spatial space as well as in the velocity space.) To treat these two kinds
of distribution functions at the same time, a diﬀerent type of distribution
function, called the solid-angle-average distribution function, is introduced
as

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Z f (t, r, v)dΩ,

(1)

where ∆Ω represents one of the solid angle ranges in the velocity space
deﬁned by the investigator and f (t, r, v) is the “ordinary” distribution func-
tion. By letting each of ∆Ω be adequately small, the newly employed dis-
tribution function is capable of describing gas dynamics with any desired
accuracy. Provided that collisions in a Boltzmann gas can be neglected, the
solid-angle-average distribution function is found to be

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

Ur0 r,

where, referring to Fig. 1, ∆S1 is an arbitrarily chosen virtual surface within
the eﬀective cone deﬁned by −∆Ω at the point r, ∆S2 stands for all bound-
ary surfaces within the eﬀective cone, η is the local emission rate of boundary
surface (acting like a surface-like molecular source), r0 represents the posi-
tion of dS0, Ω0 is the solid angle of the velocity but takes the direction
of (r − r0), t0 is the local time deﬁned by t0 = t − |r − r0|/v, α is the
angle between the normal of dS0 and the vector r − r0, f ct is the contin-
uous part of the distribution function existing previously, and Ur0 r is the
path-clearness step function, which is equal to 1 if the path r0r is free from
blocking otherwise it is equal to 0.

The objective of this paper is to include collisional eﬀects in the path-

integral formalism.

According to the conventional wisdom collisions can be analyzed by the
method developed by Boltzmann long ago, in which it is understood that
there is a symmetry between the ways molecules enter and leave a phase vol-
ume element. Peculiarly enough, this well-accepted understanding includes
actually hidden fallacies[3], which can brieﬂy be summarized as follows. In
terms of studying collisions in a Boltzmann gas, there are two issues that are
supposedly important. The ﬁrst one is related to how many collisions take
place within a phase volume element and during a certain time; the second
one is related to how the scattered molecules will, after collisions, spread out
over the velocity space and over the spatial space. These two issues involve
diﬀerent physics and have to be formulated diﬀerently. If the molecules leav-
ing a phase volume element is of interest, one needs to take care of only the
ﬁrst issue; whereas if the molecules entering a volume element is of inter-
est, one needs to concern oneself with both the issues aforementioned. This
imparity simply suggests that the time-reversal symmetry, though indeed
exists for a single collision between two molecules, cannot play a decisive
role in studying collective eﬀects of collision.

In the present paper we formulate the collisional eﬀects partly in an
unconventional way. In deriving how many molecules make collisions, the
standard method is employed without much discussion; but, in formulat-
ing how scattered molecules enter a six-dimensional phase volume element,
which is an absolute must for the purpose of this paper, a rather diﬀerent
and slightly sophisticated approach is introduced.

In sec. 2, general considerations concerning basic collisional process are
given. It is pointed out that only the scattering cross section in the center-of-
mass frame is well deﬁned and can be employed in our studies. Sec. 3 gives
a formula that describes how a molecule, when moving along its path, will
survive from collisions. Sec. 4 investigates how molecular collisions create
molecules that enter a speciﬁc phase volume element. In the investigation,
both the colliding molecules and the scattered molecules are allowed to have
distributions. (Otherwise, singularities will arise, as Ref. 3 reveals.) Sec. 5
includes all the collisional eﬀects in a complete path-integral formulation. In
Sec. 6, approximation methods are introduced to make the new formulation
more calculable and an application of the method is demonstrated. Sec. 7
oﬀers a brief summary.

Throughout this paper, to make our discussion as simple as possible, it
is assumed that molecules of interest are all identical, but distinguishable,
perfectly rigid spheres and they move freely when not making collisions.

2 General considerations of collision

Firstly, we recall general features of binary collisions in terms of classical
mechanics. Consider two molecules: one is called molecule 1 and the other
molecule 2. Let v1 and v2 label their respective velocities before the collision.
The center-of-mass velocity and the velocity of molecule 1 relative to the
center-of-mass are before the collision

c =

1
2

(v1 + v2) and u =

1
2

(v1 − v2).

(3)

Similarly, the center-of-mass velocity and the velocity of molecule 1 relative
to the center-of-mass are after the collision

c′ =

1
2

(v′

1 + v′

2) and u′ =

1
2

(v′

1 − v′

2).

The conservation laws of classical mechanics tell us that

c = c′

and |u| = |u′| = u.

(4)

(5)

Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the geometrical relationship of these ve-
locities. Note that, for the collision deﬁned as above the ﬁnal velocities
of the two molecules, such as u′, v′
2, cannot be completely deter-
mined unless the impact parameter of the collision is speciﬁed at the very
beginning[4].

1 and v′

At this point, mention must be made of one misconcept in that the
usual derivation of the Boltzmann equation gets involved[3]. In an attempt
to invoke the time-reversal symmetry of molecular collision, the standard
treatment in textbooks[5] deﬁnes the scattering cross section in the labora-
tory frame in such a way that

¯σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2)dv′

1dv′
2

(6)

represents the number of molecules per unit time (per unit ﬂux of type 1
molecules incident upon a type 2 molecule) emerging after scattering with
respective ﬁnal velocities between v′
2 and
2 + dv′
v′
2.

1 and between v′

1 and v′

1 + dv′

If a close look at expression (6) is taken, we may ﬁnd that the value
of ¯σ in it is ill-deﬁned. As Fig. 2b clearly shows, the molecules of type 1,
namely the ones with the velocities v′
1 after the collisions, will spread out
over a two-dimensional surface in the velocity space (forming a spherical shell

4

with diameter 2u) rather than over a three-dimensional velocity volume as
suggested by the deﬁnition. Because of this seemingly small fault, the value
of ¯σ actually depends on the size and shape of dv′
1 and cannot be treated
as a uniquely deﬁned quantity theoretically and experimentally.

Another type of scattering cross section, which is elaborated nicely in
textbooks of classical mechanics and suﬀers from no diﬃculty, is in terms of
the relative velocities u and u′, as shown in Fig. 3. It is deﬁned in such a
way that the area element

dS = σ(Ωu

′)dΩu

′

(7)

represents the number of molecules per unit time (per unit ﬂux of type
1 molecules with the relative velocity u incident upon a type 2 molecule)
emerging after scattering with the ﬁnal relative velocity u′ pointing in a
′. Note that the deﬁnition (7),
direction within the solid angle range dΩu
in which the center-of-mass velocity c or c′ becomes irrelevant, makes good
sense in the center-of-mass frame rather than in the laboratory frame.

Before ﬁnishing this section we turn to discussing how collisions can
generally aﬀect the solid-angle-average distribution function f (t, r, v, ∆Ω)
deﬁned by (1). In view of that gas dynamics of the Boltzmann gas develops
along molecular paths, as shown by (2), we believe that collisional eﬀects
should also be investigated and formulated in terms of molecular paths.
Fig. 4 illustrates that there are two types of processes. On one hand,
a molecule that would reach r with the velocity v at time t may suﬀer
from a collision and become irrelevant to the distribution function; on the
other hand, an “irrelevant” molecule may collide with another molecule
and then become relevant.
It should be stressed again that there is no
symmetry between the two types of processes. For the ﬁrst type of process,
we only need to investigate what happens to a single molecule. If a collision
takes place with it, we know that the molecule will depart from its original
path, which is suﬃcient as far as our formulation is concerned. For the
second type of process, we need to know:
(i) how many collisions take
place within the eﬀective cone; (ii) how the scattered molecules spread out
over the phase space. As stressed in the introduction, the second issue is
particularly essential because of that the distribution function is nothing
but the molecular density per unit phase volume, in other words we must
concern ourselves with the scattered molecules “around” the phase point
(r, v), rather than the scattered molecules “at” the phase point (r, v).

In the next two sections, we will formulate the two processes respectively.

5

Since the collisions are assumed to take place in terms of classical mechanics
all the calculations can be done without analytical diﬃculty.

3 The surviving probability

Consider a molecule moving along a spatial path where many other molecules
make their own motions. If P (τ ) denotes the probability that the molecule
survives a time τ without suﬀering a collision and w(τ )dτ denotes the prob-
ability that the molecule makes a collision between time τ and time τ + dτ ,
we must have a simple relation

P (τ + dτ ) − P (τ ) = −P (τ )w(τ )dτ,

which yields

1
P

dP
dτ

= −w(τ ).

(8)

(9)

Therefore, the surviving probability associated with a molecule moving from
r0 to r with the velocity v can be expressed formally by

P (r0, r; v) = exp(−Zl

w(τ )dτ ),

(10)

where l represents the path along that the molecule will move if no collision
takes place. For the Boltzmann gas under consideration, whose molecules
are assumed to be free from forces except in collisions, the path of a molecule
is nothing but the segment of straight line linking up the two points.

The surviving probability deﬁned by (10) can be evaluated by the stan-
dard approach[5]. To make this paper complete, we include the evaluation in
what follows. Suppose that the molecule encounters a molecular beam with
the velocity v1 at the path element dl. In terms of the molecular beam, the
molecule has the speed 2u = 2|u|, in which u = (v − v1)/2, and it occupies
the volume with respect to the beam

2uσ(Ωu

′ )dΩu

′dτ,

(11)

where σ(Ωu
molecular density of the colliding beam is

′) and Ωu

′ are deﬁned in (7) and illustrated by Fig. 3. The

f (τ, rl, v1)dv1,

(12)

6

where rl is the position of the path element dl. Thus, the total collision
probability can be written as

wdτ = dτ Zv1ZΩu

′

2uf (τ, rl, v1)σ(Ωu

′)dΩu

′dv1.

In terms of (13), the surviving probability (10) becomes

P (r0, r; v) = exp"−ZlZv1ZΩu

′

2uσ(Ωu

′)f (τ, rl, v1)dΩu

′ dv1dτ.# ,

(13)

(14)

where dτ is the time period during that the molecule passes the path element
dl.

The formula (14) describes how collisions make the number of molecules
along a certain path decrease. The method employed has nothing partic-
ularly new in comparison with that employed by the textbook treatment.
Before changing our subject, one thing worth mentioning. In deriving (14),
we had luck not to be concerned with how the scattered molecules spread
out over the phase space. It is readily understandable that the same luck
will not be there in the next section.

4 The creation probability

We now study the process in which collisions make molecules give contribu-
tions to the solid-angle-average distribution function f (t, r, v, ∆Ω).

It should be mentioned that in this section, unlike in the last sections,
1 represent the velocities of colliding molecules while v and v1

v′ and v′
represent the velocities of scattered molecules.

The see how the scattered molecules spread out over the six-dimensional
phase space, we consider a relatively small six-dimensional volume element
as

∆r · ∆v = ∆r · v2∆v∆Ω.

(15)

In (15) ∆r is chosen to enclose the point r in f (t, r, v, ∆Ω), ∆v to enclose the
speed v in f (t, r, v, ∆Ω); and ∆Ω is just the ﬁnite velocity solid-angle-range
∆Ω in f (t, r, v, ∆Ω). The discussion below will be focused on molecules that
really enter, after collisions, this six-dimensional volume element.

Note that in Fig. 5a each point in the spatial volume ∆r deﬁnes an
eﬀective cone, within which physical events may make impact on the distri-
bution function at the point. This means that the entire eﬀective cone, with

7

respect to the spatial volume element ∆r, must be slightly larger than the
one deﬁned solely by r, as shown by Fig. 5b. Fortunately, we will, in the
end of formulation, let

∆r → 0

(16)

and thus the actual entire eﬀective cone is only academically larger. On this
understanding, we will not distinguish between the entire eﬀective cone and
the eﬀective cone deﬁned solely by the single point r.

Look at molecular collisions taking place within the eﬀective cone shown
in Fig. 6. Note that Fig. 6a, while coming to one’s mind immediately,
is not an appropriate picture to manifest the collision process aﬀecting the
distribution function at the point r since both the colliding molecules and
scattered molecules in it have no true distributions. (Ref. 3 analyzes the
situation and brings out that such mental picture will ﬁnally lead to singu-
larities.) In Fig. 6b, the velocity distributions of all colliding molecules and
scattered molecules are explicitly illustrated. Our task here is to formulate
the relationship between the distribution functions of colliding molecules
and the scattered molecules (including their velocity distributions and spa-
tial distributions).

We divide the entire eﬀective cone into many individual regions, denoted
by (∆r0)i. It is obvious that within each of the regions collisions can gen-
erate a certain number of molecules that will ﬁnally enter the phase volume
deﬁned by (15). Let ncl
In what
immediately follows, it is assumed that the generated molecules suﬀer no
further collisions. The entire contributions of all collisions to the distribu-
tion function f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) can then be expressed by

i denote the number of such molecules.

f cl(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆r · ∆v Xi

ncl
i ,

(17)

in which i runs all the divided regions within the eﬀective cone. For later
use, we wish to rewrite (17) as

f cl(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Xi

ncl
i

v2(∆r)i(∆v)i

.

(18)

The advantage of (18) over (17) is that (∆r)i and (∆v)i in (18) may be
chosen to be diﬀerent for diﬀerent i as long as the molecular number of ncl
i
is counted up accordingly. (Of course, all velocity directions of the molecules
have to be within the solid angle range ∆Ω.)

8

Now, consider a small, much smaller than ∆Ω, solid angle range ∆Ω0
at a point r0 towards the point r, as shown in Fig. 7a (r0 is within the
eﬀective cone).
It is easy to see that if collisions take place at r0, the
scattered molecules having velocities within ∆Ω0 will spread out over the
spatial volume element

∆r ≈ |r − r0|2v∆Ω0∆t,

(19)

as shown in Fig. 7b. Accordingly, they will spread out over the velocity
volume element

∆v ≈ v2∆v∆Ω0,

(20)

as shown in Fig. 7c. Since ∆Ω0 is much smaller than ∆Ω (the latter one
is ﬁnite), a molecule having a velocity within ∆Ω0 can be regarded as one
having a velocity within ∆Ω. Thus, by letting (∆r)i in (18) be equal to
∆r of (19) and letting (∆v)i in (18) be equal to ∆v in (20), expression (18)
becomes

f cl(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Z

lim

(∆Ω0,∆v,∆t)→(0,0,0)

ρcl(r0)dr0

v3∆v|r − r0|2∆Ω0∆t

,

(21)

where the integral is over the entire eﬀective cone deﬁned by r and −∆Ω
and ρcl is the local density (per unit spatial volume) of the molecules that
are “emitted” from r0 due to collisions and ﬁnally enter the speed range ∆v
and the solid-angle range ∆Ω0 during the time ∆t.

To determine the density ρcl, we have two tasks. One is to derive the
collision rate at r0 and the other is to derive what fraction of the scattered
molecules emerge with velocities within the range ∆v∆Ω0. The ﬁrst task
can be accomplished in a well-known way while the second one cannot.

As discussed in the last section, a speciﬁc molecule with the initial ve-
locity v′ that collides with a beam of molecules with the initial velocity v′
1
occupies a volume with respect to the beam

2u∆tσ(Ωu)dΩu,

(22)

where Ωu is the solid angle of the scattered relative velocity u = (v − v1)/2.
The number of “such speciﬁc” molecules within dv′dr0 is

f (t0, r0, v′)dv′dr0.

The density of the molecules with v′

1 is characterized by

f (t0, r0, v′

1)dv′
1.

9

(23)

(24)

Therefore, the number of all collisions within the spatial volume dr0 within
the time ∆t is

dr0Z dv′Z dv′

1Z dΩuf (v′)f (v′

1)2uσ(Ωu)∆t.

(25)

We now to evaluate the probability that the molecules expressed by (25)
enter the velocity range ∆v∆Ω0. Note that the integration of dv′dv′
1 is
carried out in the laboratory frame while the integration of dΩu is in the
center-of-mass frame, which makes the evaluation quite diﬃcult. For this
reason, we make the integration conversion as

Z dv′Z dv′

1 · · · = Z dc′Z dΩu

′Z u2dukJk · · · ,

(26)

where u = u′ is understood and kJk represents the Jacobian between the
center-of-mass frame and the laboratory frame

kJk =

∂(v′, v′
1)
∂(c′, u′)

.

(27)

Equation (4) tells us that the Jacobian is equal to 8.

By making use of (25) and (26), the distribution function f cl expressed

by (21) becomes

f cl(t, r, v, ∆Ω) ≈

kJk

2uσ(Ωu)f (t0, r0, c′ − u′)f (t0, r0, c′ + u′).

In regard to expression (28), some observations are made. As mentioned
in Sec. 2, if two molecular beams with deﬁnite velocities v′ and v′
1 col-
lide with each other the scattered molecules will spread out only over a
two-dimensional spherical surface in the velocity space, which implies that
diﬃculty arises if the velocity distributions of scattered molecules are of con-
cern. Whereas, in this expression, all the colliding molecules are allowed to
have distributions, the value of u′ = u is allowed to vary and therefore the
scattered molecules explicitly spread out over the velocity space (as well as
over the spatial space). Furthermore, by using the notation

Z Z∆v∆Ω0

· · · · · · ,

10

(29)

we have ensured that only the scattered molecules of relevance are taken
into account.

In Fig. 8, which is drawn for scattered molecules in the velocity space,
we are concerned only with molecules that ﬁnally enter the range ∆v∆Ω0.
Allowing u to vary a little bit, we may let the scattered molecules ﬁll out
the velocity range. Namely, we have

Z Z∆Ω0∆v

u2dΩudu(· · ·) ≈ v2∆v∆Ω0(· · ·),

(30)

where (· · ·) represents other factors that have been treated as constants in
terms of the inﬁnitesimally small range of ∆v∆Ω0.

Inserting (30) into (28) and taking the limits ∆Ω0 → 0 and ∆v → 0, we

ﬁnally arrive at

f cl(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

v∆Ω Z−∆Ω

dr0Z dc′Z dΩu

kJk
|r − r0|2 2uσ(Ωu)f (t0, r0, c′ − u′)f (t0, r0, c′ + u′),

where t0 = t − |r − r0|/v and the integration

Z dΩu

′ · · ·

(31)

(32)

is over the entire solid angle (0 → 4π). Note that u, u′ and u in the
integrand of (31) have to be determined skillfully. First use c = c′ and
′ to determine
v = v(r − r0)/|r − r0| to determine u, then use u = |u| and Ωu
u′, as shown in Fig. 9.

We have directly formulated the contribution to the solid-angle-average
distribution function from collisions. It should be noted that the formula-
tion can be done only under the condition that the velocity solid-angle range
∆Ω is ﬁnite: if both ∆Ω and ∆Ω0 in the formulation were assumed to be
inﬁnitesimally small, the limiting processes concerning the two quantities
would not be in harmony with each other. This shows again that the intro-
duction of the solid-angle-average distribution function is a must to the gas
dynamics of Boltzmann gas.

5 Complete formulation

The complete formulation for the collisional Boltzmann gas is now in order.
In Fig. 10, we have depicted a piece of boundary and some collisions taking

11

place within the eﬀective cone. As said before, all these events can directly
contribute to the solid-angle-average distribution function.

We then use the following sum to represent the total distribution function

f (t, r, v, ∆Ω) = f(i) + f(ii) + f(iii),

(33)

where f(i), f(ii) and f(iii) represent the contributions from the existing con-
tinuous distribution function, from the piece of boundary and from the col-
lisions respectively. For simplicity, no other types of distribution functions
are assumed to exist within the eﬀective cone.

As has been illustrated in Sec. 3, a molecule that makes its motion
towards the point r may suﬀer a collision with other molecules. The involved
surviving probability P has been deﬁned by (14). By taking the probability
into account, the ﬁrst term in (2) becomes

f(i)(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆ΩZ∆S1

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)| cos α|dS0

|r − r0|2

P (r0, r, v0),

(34)

where v0 in P take the value of v and points to the direction of (r − r0).

By taking the same eﬀect into account, the second term in (2) can be

expressed by

f(ii)(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S2

η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dS0

|r − r0|2v3

P (r0, r, v0).

(35)

A rather detailed discussion on the molecular emission rate η has been
included in Ref. 1. Here, we content ourselves with pointing out that the
rate η satisﬁes the normalization condition at the surface element dS0. If no
molecular absorption and production by the surface element are assumed,
the following expression holds

Z η(t, r, v1, Ω1)dΩ1dv1 = Z v2f (t, r, v2, Ω2)| cos θ|v2

2dΩ2dv2,

(36)

in which θ is the angle between the velocity v2 and the normal of dS0, Ω1
points to an outward direction of dS0 and Ω2 points to an inward direction of
dS0. The concrete relation between η(t, r, v) and f (t, r, v) must, of course,
be ultimately determined by experimental data[6].

In obtaining (31) for the distribution function created by collisions, fur-
ther collisions were excluded. To include possible further collisions, the

12

contribution expressed by (31) needs to be modiﬁed as

f(iii)(t, r, v, ∆Ω) =

kJk

|r − r0|2 2uσ(Ωu

1

v∆Ω Z−∆Ω

dr0Z dc′Z dΩu

′

′)f (t0, r0, c′ − u′)f (t0, r0, c′ + u′)P (r0, r, v0),

(37)

where the integration of dr0 is over the entire eﬀective cone deﬁned by r
and −∆Ω, |v0| ≡ v and takes the direction of (r − r0), u′ is deﬁned by
u = |c − v0| and Ωu

′.

In these formulas, the probability P should be set to be zero at the very

beginning if there is physical blocking along the path r0r.

Equations (33)-(37) constitute a complete set of integral equations that
describe the collisional Boltzmann gas deﬁned in this paper. The formulation
proves in a theoretical way an obvious intuition that the distribution function
at a spatial point can directly be aﬀected by physical events taking place
at other, even remote, points in view of the fact that a molecule can freely
pass any distance in a certain probability. In this sense, the picture here is
more “kinetic” than that associated with the Boltzmann equation, in which
physical events have to make their inﬂuence region by region (like what
happen in a continuous medium).

Another comment is about the famous H-theorem.

If the involved
distribution function is initially nonuniform in the spatial space and non-
Maxwellian in the velocity space, the resultant distribution function given
by the formalism will approach the uniform Maxwellian. Though such ex-
plicit proof has not been achieved yet, we believe that this must be the case
by noticing a general discussion stating that as long as a statistical process
is a Markoﬃan one the H-theorem must hold true[7].

6 Approximation and application

Although the formulation oﬀered in the previous section is formally com-
plete, there still exist diﬃculties that hinder one from performing calculation
for a realistic gas. Unlike the solution for the collisionless Boltzmann gas,
given by (2), the equation system in the last section, namely (33)-(37), is an
integral-equation set. Without knowing the entire history of the distribution
function f (t), the integrals in the system cannot be evaluated accurately.

Fortunately, there are situations for which adequate approximations can
be introduced and meaningful results can be obtained. In what follows, we

13

ﬁrst deal with weakly collisional gases and then give some discussion on how
the consideration can apply to more general cases.

If the density of a Boltzmann gas is relatively low, by which we imply that
the mean free path of molecules is not too short comparing with the length
scale of the system or that the mean free time is not too short comparing
with the time scale of the phenomena of interest, we may apply the following
iterating procedure to calculate the distribution function.

Firstly, we assume that the system can be treated as a collisionless Boltz-
mann gas and the collisionless formulation can directly applied. Namely, we
have the zeroth-order solution

f [0]
(i) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S1

f [0]
(ii) =

1

v3∆ΩZ∆S2

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)| cos α|dS0

|r − r0|2
η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dS0

|r − r0|2

.

Then, we can construct the ﬁrst-order distribution function by inserting
the zeroth-order solution into all right sides of the equations (33)-(37), which
yields

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

f [1]
(i) =

1

∆Ω Z∆S1

f [1]
(ii) =

1

v3∆Ω Z∆S2

f ct(t0, r0, v, Ω0)| cos α|dS0

|r − r0|2
η(t0, r0, v, Ω0)dS0

|r − r0|2

P [0](r0, r, v0)

P [0](r0, r, v0).

and

f [1]
(iii) =

1

v∆Ω Z−∆Ω

dr0Z dc′Z dΩu

′

kJk

|r − r0|2

2uσ(Ωu)f [0](t0, r0, c′ − u′)f [0](t0, r0, c′ + u′)P [0](r0, r, v0).

In all the ﬁrst-order formulas, the surviving probability is deﬁned as

P [0](r0, r; v0) = exp"−ZlZv1ZΩu

′

2uσ(Ωu

′)f [0](τ, rl, v1)dΩu

′dv1dτ.# . (43)

In equations (42) and (43), f [0] is the total zeroth-order distribution function,
namely f [0] = f [0]

(i) + f [0]
(ii).

Along this line, we can formulate higher-order solutions for dilute gases.
If the gas of interest is rather dense, the approximation method presented

14

above may not work eﬀectively. One wishes, however, to point out that for
the regions near boundaries, where the distribution function suﬀers from
most irregularities and collisions between molecules have no enough time
to erase such irregularities, the introduced method should still make sense.
In view of this, it is expected that a hybrid method will be developed, in
which the approach here and other eﬀective approaches, such as the ordinary
ﬂuid theory, can be combined into one scheme so that more practical gases
become treatable.

To illustrate the application of our approximation scheme, we investigate
a gas leaking out of box through a small hole. For simplicity, we assume,
referring Fig. 11, that the zeroth-order solution of the leaking gas is con-
ﬁned to a “one-dimensional thin pipe” (shaded in the ﬁgure), which can be
expressed by

f [0] = ( C0 exp(cid:2)−mv2

0

x/(2κT )(cid:3)

(inside the pipe)
(outside the pipe)

(44)

and then we try to determine the collisional eﬀects of the distribution func-
tion.

Note that the distribution function expressed by (44) is kind of special so
that the formula (42) should be slightly modiﬁed. For this purpose, we write
the diﬀerential collision probability as (the subindex x of vx is suppressed)

[f (v′)∆Sdx0dv′][f (v′

1)dv′

1][2uσ(Ωu)dΩu],

(45)

where ∆S is the cross area of the pipe. By making the variable transforma-
tion, we obtain

Z ∞

0

dv′Z ∞

0

dv′

0

1 · · · = Z ∞
dc′Z ∞
= Z ∞

0

0

dc′Z +∞

−∞

du′kJk · · ·

u2du4(u2)−1 · · · .

In a way similar to that has been presented in the last section, we ﬁnally
arrive at

f [1][(∆θ)i] =

∆S

v(∆θ)i

Z−(∆θ)i

dx0

∞

Z0

dc′ 8σ(Ωu)

u|r − r0|2 f [0](c′ + u′)f [0](c′ − u′), (46)

where (∆θ)i is the polar angle range set by the investigator (the azimuthal
angle range is irrelevant in the case).

15

The formula (46) can be calculated easily with a computer. Referring to

Fig. 11b, we set

v = 1,

r⊥ = 1,

m
2κT

= 1,

let (∆θ)i be the interval

(cid:20)0.4π − 0.52 +

i
50

, 0.4π − 0.5 +

i

50(cid:21)

and notice σ(Ωu) is constant[4]. The numerical results are listed as the
following: (normalized by f [(∆θ)0])

f [(∆θ)0] = 1.00000e + 00
f [(∆θ)5] = 5.23910e − 01
f [(∆θ)10] = 2.01786e − 01
f [(∆θ)15] = 5.03200e − 02
f [(∆θ)20] = 4.76340e − 03
f [(∆θ)25] = 5.11013e − 05.

7 Summary

In this paper, we have proposed a complete mathematical scheme to deal
with the Boltzmann gas. The scheme has many new features. In addition
to those given in Ref. 1, some related to treating collisional eﬀects are the
following.

Firstly, collisional eﬀects are investigated in the full velocity-and-position
space. In particular, a six-dimensional volume element is explicitly deﬁned
and a calculation concerning molecules entering the volume element is di-
rectly performed.

Secondly, both the colliding molecules and scattered molecules are al-
lowed to have distributions. In other words, we consider the full and collec-
tive behavior of collisions, in which the time-reversal symmetry existing for
a collision of two molecules plays almost no role.

Thirdly, the treatment in this approach is consistent with the previous
approach to the collisionless Boltzmann gas in the sense that all the formulas
are given in terms of what happen along molecular paths.

Finally, the resultant formulas of this approach are, in many practical

situations, calculable by means of today’s computer.

It is believed that this approach will be developed further so that a better

understanding of complicated ﬂuid phenomena can be achieved.

Decay laws for three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence

Decay laws for three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are obtained
from high-resolution numerical simulations using up to 5123 modes. For the typical case of ﬁnite
magnetic helicity H the energy decay is found to be governed by the conservation of H and the
decay of the energy ratio Γ = EV /EM . One ﬁnds the relation (E5/2/ǫH)Γ1/2/(1 + Γ)3/2 = const,
−0.5 in
ǫ = −dE/dt. Use of the observation that Γ(t) ∝ E(t) results in the asymptotic law E ∼ t
good agreement with the numerical behavior. For the special case H = 0 the energy decreases more
rapidly E ∼ t

−1, where the transition to the ﬁnite-H behavior occurs at relatively small values.

Many plasmas, especially in astrophysics, are charac-
terized by turbulent magnetic ﬁelds, the best-known and
most readily observable example being the solar wind.
The convenient framework to describe such turbulence
is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Here one ignores the
actual complicated dissipation processes, which occur on
the smallest scales and would usually require a kinetic
treatment, assuming that the main turbulent scales are
essentially independent thereof.
Instead dissipation is
modeled by simple diﬀusion terms. If, moreover, interest
is focussed on the intrinsic turbulence dynamics, one can
also ignore the largest scales in the system, which depend
on the speciﬁc way of turbulence generation, restricting
consideration to a small open homogeneous domain of
the globally inhomogeneous turbulence.

a
Homogeneous MHD turbulence has become
paradigm in fundamental turbulence research, which has
been receiving considerable attention. It is well known
that 2D and 3D MHD turbulence have many features
in common concerning, in particular, the cascade prop-

invariants: the energy E = 1
2 R (v2 + B2)dV , the cross
helicity K = R v · BdV , and a purely magnetic quantity,
the magnetic helicity H = R A · BdV in 3D and the
mean-square magnetic potential H ψ = R ψ2dV in 2D,
which both exhibit an inverse cascade. Many theoretical
predictions do not distinguish between 2D and 3D, con-
cerning, e.g., the tendency toward velocity and magnetic
ﬁeld alignment or the spectral properties. Thus it is not
surprising, that numerical studies of MHD turbulence
have been mostly concentrated on two-dimensional sim-
ulations, where high Reynolds numbers can be reached
much more readily, see e.g., [2]– [6]. While 2D simula-
tions are now being performed with up to N 2 = 40962
modes (or, more accurately, collocation points) [6], stud-
ies of 3D MHD homogeneous turbulence have to date
been restricted to relatively low Reynolds numbers using
typically N 3 = 643 modes, e.g., [7], [8], precluding an
inertial range scaling behavior. Also in Ref. [9], where a
somewhat higher Reynolds number could be reached by

using 1803 modes, attention was focussed primarily on
the process of turbulence generation from smooth initial
conditions and the properties of the prominent spatial
structures, current and vorticity sheets.

In this Letter we present results of a numerical study
of freely decaying 3D MHD turbulence with spatial res-
olution up to 5123 modes. We discuss the decay laws of
the integral quantities, in particular the energy E and
the ratio of kinetic and magnetic energies Γ = EV /EM ,
and their dependence on the quasi-constant value of H.
The energy decay is found to follow a simple law, which
is determined by Γ(t) and H. While most previous stud-
ies have been restricted to the case of negligible magnetic
helicity H ≃ 0, we focus attention on the properties of
the turbulence for ﬁnite H, which is more typical for
naturally existing MHD turbulence occuring mostly in
rotating systems. We ﬁnd that for ﬁnite H the energy
decays signiﬁcantly more slowly than for H ≃ 0. This
behavior is primarily caused by the rapid decrease of the
energy ratio Γ, which has the same decay time as the
energy.

veniently used in 3D turbulence simulations (instead of

tions). Initial conditions are

which are characterized by random phases αk, βk and
satisfy the conditions k · Bk = k · vk = 0 as well as

E = 1 and Γ = 1. Further restrictions on Bk and vk
arise by requiring speciﬁc values of H and K, respec-
tively. The wavenumber k0, the location of the maxi-
mum of the initial energy spectrum, is chosen as k0 = 4,
which allows the inverse cascade of Hk to develop freely
during the simulation time of 10-20 eddy turnover times.
This implies a certain loss of inertial range, i.e., a reduc-
tion in Reynolds number, but the sacriﬁce is unavoid-
able in the presence of inverse cascade dynamics. Choos-
ing k0 ∼ 1 would lead to magnetic condensation in the
lowest-k state, which would aﬀect the entire turbulence
dynamics. We have used both normal diﬀusion ν = 1
and hyperdiﬀusion ν = 2. Apart from the fact that in-
ertial ranges are wider and H is much better conserved
for ν = 2 than for ν = 1, no essential diﬀerences are
found between the two cases. The generalized magnetic
Prandtl number ην /µν has been set equal to unity. Table
I lists the most important parameters of the simulation
runs.

The energy decay law is a characteristic property of
a turbulent system.
In hydrodynamic turbulence the
decay rate depends on the energy spectrum at small
k. Assuming time invariance of the Loitsianskii integral
0 dl l4hvl(x+l)vl(x)i the energy has been predicted
L = R
to follow the similarity law E ∼ t−10/7 [10]. The invari-
ance of L has, however, been questioned, see e.g., [11].
Both closure theory [12] and low-Reynolds number simu-
lations [8] yield a signiﬁcantly slower decrease, E ∼ t−1.
Experimental measurements of the energy decay law t−n
are rather diﬃcult and do not give a uniform picture, n
ranging between 1.3 [13] and 2 [14].

The invariance of the Loitsianskii integral has recently
also been postulated for MHD turbulence [4], where
LMHD is deﬁned in analogy to L in terms of the lon-
±
gitudinal correlation function hz
l (x)i of the El-
saesser ﬁelds z± = v ± B. Since z2 ∼ E, this assumption
gives LMHD ∼ L5E = const, where L is the macroscopic
scale length of the turbulence.
In addition the expres-
sion for the energy transfer dE/dt = −ǫ ∼ −z4/LB0
was used, which formally accounts for the Alfv´en eﬀect
[16], [17]. These relations give (dE/dt)B0/E11/5 = const
and hence E ∼ t−5/6, treating B0 as constant. One
may, however, argue that the Alfv´en eﬀect is only im-
portant on small scales l ≪ L, while on the scale L
of the energy-containing eddies B0 is not constant but
B0 ∼ E1/2 (except for the case that B0 is an exter-
nal ﬁeld, which would, however, make the turbulence
strongly anisotropic), hence ǫ ∼ E3/2/L, which would
give the same result n = 10/7 as predicted for hydrody-
namic turbulence. Low-resolution numerical simulations
[8] indicate n ≃ 1, which is also found in recent simula-
tions of compressible MHD turbulence [18].

For ﬁnite magnetic helicity H provides a constant dur-
ing energy decay, which for high Reynolds number is
more robust than the questionable invariance of the Loit-

sianskii integral.
It is true that in contrast to the 2D
case, where EM and H ψ are tightly coupled, such that
EM 6= 0 implies H ψ 6= 0, in 3D a state with H = 0
and ﬁnite magnetic energy is possible. But this is only
a special and not typical case, since in nature magnetic
turbulence usually occurs in rotating systems, which give
rise to ﬁnite magnetic helicity.

If the process of turbulence decay is self-similar, which
also implies that the energy ratio Γ remains constant, the
energy decay law follows from a simple argument [15].
With the scale length L = E3/2/ǫ, the dominant scale of
the energy-containing eddies, we have

since owing to the assumed self-similarity EM ∼ EV ∼
E. Inserting L gives

which has the similarity solution E ∼ t−2/3. In Fig. 1
the ratio E5/2/(ǫH) is plotted for the runs from Table I
with H 6= 0 and small initial correlation ρ0. The ﬁgure
shows that this quantity is not constant, but increases in
time. Moreover, there is a signiﬁcant scatter of the diﬀer-
ent curves. Integration yields a slower asymptotic energy
decay than predicted n ≃ 0.5 − 0.55. (The log-log repre-
sentation of E(t), often given in the literature to make a
power law behavior visible, is misleading, since the major
part of such a curve refers to the transition period of tur-
bulence generation. The solution (t − t∗)−n approaches
the power law t−n only asymptotically for t ≫ t∗, where
t∗ is not accurately known. We therefore prefer to plot
the decay law in the primary diﬀerential form.)

We can attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the
turbulence does not decay in a fully self-similar way.
Indeed the energy ratio Γ is found to decrease rapidly,
in contrast to the 2D case, where Γ decays much more
slowly, typically logarithmically [2], [3].
(The ratio of
viscous and resistive dissipation ǫµ/ǫη, however, remains
constant just as in the 2D case [3], which simply reﬂects
the basic property, that dissipation takes place in current
sheets and that these are also vorticity sheets, i.e., the
location of viscous dissipation.) Let us incorporate the
dynamic change of Γ in the theory of the energy decay.
Assuming that the most important nonlinearities arise
from the v · ∇ contributions in the MHD equations, Eq.

relation (4).

Figure 2 shows

using the
that
(E5/2/ǫH)Γ1/2/(1 + Γ)3/2 is indeed nearly constant for
t > 2, when turbulence is fully developed, and the scat-
ter in Fig. 1 is strongly reduced. Hence relation (6) is
generally valid for ﬁnite magnetic helicity. It is also in-
dependent of the magnitude of the dissipation coeﬃcients

2

and character of the dissipation (ν = 1 or 2), as long as
H is well conserved.

Also the time evolution of the energy ratio Γ exhibits
a uniform behavior which is demonstrated in Fig. 3. The
slight shift of the uppermost curve corresponding to the
smallest value of H (run 4), is due to the smaller drop
of Γ during the very ﬁrst phase of turbulence generation
t < 0.5 not included in the ﬁgure. Moreover, we ﬁnd that
Γ(t) is proportional to E(t), Γ ≃ cE/H, c = 0.1 − 0.15,
as seen in Fig. 4, where Γ/(E/H) is plotted. Inserting
this result in Eq. (6) we obtain the diﬀerential equation
for E, which in the asymptotic limit Γ ≪ 1 becomes

with the similarity solution E ∼ t−0.5. For ﬁnite Γ
the theory predicts a somewhat steeper decay ﬂatten-
ing asymptotically to t−0.5 as Γ becomes small, which
is exactly the behavior of E(t) observed in the simula-
tions. (Note, that if E(t) is plotted on the traditional
log-log scale, which overrates the transition period t ∼ 1,
a steeper decay would be suggested.) The relation Γ ∝ E
now gives also the similarity law for the kinetic energy
EV ∼ t−1.

This theory does not apply to the special case H = 0.
Here we ﬁnd indeed a diﬀerent decay law, E ∼ t−1 from
run 3, which is consistent with previous simulations at
lower Reynolds numbers [8] and with the prediction in
Ref. [4]. The transition to the slower decay for ﬁnite H
occurs at relatively small values, 0.1–0.2 of the maximum
possible value.

We have also studied the eﬀect of an initial velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld alignment ρ0 = K/E. For small ρ0 < 0.1
the alignment, after increasing initially, tends to saturate
at some small value, which is due to the fact that K is less
well conserved than H. For higher ρ0 > 0.3 (runs 9 and
10 in Table I) the alignment becomes very strong, which
as expected slows down the energy decay drastically.

In conclusion we have presented a new phenomenol-
ogy of the energy decay in 3D incompressible MHD tur-
bulence, which agrees very well with direct numerical
simulations at relatively high Reynolds numbers. We
consider in particular the case of ﬁnite magnetic he-
licity H, which is typical for naturally occuring mag-
netic turbulence. The energy decay is governed by the
conservation of H and the time evolution of the en-
ergy ratio Γ = EV /EM . We ﬁnd that the relation
(E5/2/ǫH)Γ1/2/(1 + Γ)3/2 ≃ const is satisﬁed for most
H-values and is independent of the magnitude of the dis-
sipation coeﬃcients and the order of the diﬀusion oper-
ator, provided the Reynolds number is suﬃciently high
such that H is well conserved. The kinetic energy is
found to decrease more rapidly than the magnetic one,
in contrast to the behavior in 2D, in particular we ﬁnd
Γ ∝ E. This proportionality leads to a simple energy
decay law, −dE/dt ∼ E3, or E ∼ t−0.5. We also obtain

the similarity law for the kinetic energy EV ∼ t−1. For
the special case H = 0 the energy decays more rapidly,
E ∼ t−1, which agrees with previous simulations at lower
Reynolds numbers. The transition to the ﬁnite-H behav-
ior occurs at relatively small values of H.

Results concerning the spatial scaling properties of 3D
MHD turbulence will be published in a subsequent paper.

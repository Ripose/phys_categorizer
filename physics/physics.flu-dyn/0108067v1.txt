Eigenfrequencies of two mutually interacting gas bubbles in an acoustic ﬁeld are discussed theo-
retically and numerically. It is shown by a linear theory that a bubble interacting with a neighboring
bubble has three eigenfrequencies that change with the distance between two bubbles, and the sign
and magnitude of the primary Bjerknes force acting on bubbles also change according to the change
in the eigenfrequencies.

INTRODUCTION

It is known that many bubbles levitated in a liquid
form a stable structure named “bubble grapes” when a
weak standing sound wave is applied [1–4]. In this stable
structure, bubbles or clusters of them maintain a distance
each other and tend not to collide, contrary to predictions
given by the classical theory due to Bjerknes which al-
lows either only attraction or repulsion. The distance
between bubbles or clusters in the structure is compara-
ble to their sizes. A similar phenomenon can be observed
in a strong acoustic ﬁeld [5] in which bubbles form a com-
plex ﬁlamentary structure varying slowly, whose scale is
much smaller than the wavelength of the acoustic ﬁeld.
In order to understand these phenomena, one should
know thoroughly how the mutual interaction of the bub-
bles inﬂuences their acoustic properties.
[2],
Zabolotskaya showed theoretically that the eﬀective reso-
nance frequencies of two interacting bubbles rise or fall as
bubbles approach each other and that the variation in the
resonance frequencies may sometimes causes the change
of the sign of the secondary Bjerknes force, which is an
interaction force acting between pulsating bubbles, at a
certain distance. In Ref. [3], Doinikov and Zavtrak intro-
duced a similar result by taking the multiple scattering of
sound between two bubbles into account. They explain
the origin of the change in the sign of the force as follows:
When two bubbles oscillate in phase, their surfaces move
against each other resulting in a stiﬀening of the bubbles.
This may increase the eﬀective resonance frequencies of
both bubbles and may sometimes cause the change in the
sign of the force from attractive to repulsive.

In Ref.

Inﬂuences due to mutual interaction have also been
studied in regard to sonoluminescence [6,7]. In Ref. [6],
Mettin et al. examined numerically the sign and magni-
tude of the secondary Bjerknes force acting between two
small air bubbles in a strong acoustic ﬁeld. They deter-
mined that even when the distance between two bubbles
is much larger than their equilibrium sizes the magnitude
of the force becomes much larger than that predicted by
a linear theory, and the sign of the force changes near
the dynamical Brake threshold or around the nonlinear

resonance frequency. In Ref. [7], Doinikov showed that a
neighboring bubble drastically varies the magnitude and
sign of the primary Bjerknes force, which an incident
sound wave exerts on a bubble, in a strong acoustic ﬁeld.
In this paper, following Zabolotskaya’s approach, the
inﬂuences of the mutual interaction on the eﬀective res-
onance frequencies (or eigenfrequencies) of bubbles are
theoretically examined in detail. As was pointed out and
was mentioned previously, the variations in eigenfrequen-
cies strongly aﬀect the primary and secondary Bjerknes
forces. This means that full understanding of the eigen-
frequencies surely must be of help in knowing how the
forces are changed by mutual interaction. In Sec. II A,
we show that the variation in the eigenfrequencies with
respect to the distance between two bubbles is more com-
plicated than those expected by Zabolotskaya [2] and
Doinikov and Zavtrak [3,4].
In Sec. II B, additionally,
we discuss theoretically the inﬂuence of the mutual in-
teraction on the amplitude of the bubble pulsation. In
Sec. III, we show some numerical results of the primary
Bjerknes force, acting on two interacting bubbles, by us-
ing a nonlinear model in order to verify the linear theory
for the eigenfrequencies. When the frequency of an exter-
nal sound is equivalent to an eigenfrequency of a bubble,
the force vanishes because of the phase diﬀerence of π/2
between the sound and the bubble pulsation. Namely,
by observing the points where the force vanishes, one
can know how the eigenfrequencies changed by the inter-
action.

In the present study, an external sound ﬁeld of weak
or moderate amplitude with a frequency comparable to
the partial resonance frequencies of bubbles is assumed.

I. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

A gas bubble levitated in a liquid pulsates when a
sound wave is applied. The sound pressure at the bub-
ble position drives the pulsation. When other bubbles
“bubble N ”, where N is the num-
(named “bubble 2”
ber of existing bubbles) exist near the bubble (bubble
1), the pulsation of bubble 1 is also driven by the scat-
tered sound wave due to the other bubbles. Namely, the

driving pressure acting on bubble 1, pd 1, is expressed as

where pex and ps 1j are the sound pressures of the external
sound ﬁeld and the scattered wave emitted by bubble j,
respectively, at the position of bubble 1. The pressure of
the external sound can be considered uniform when the
wavelength of the standing wave is much larger than the
radii of the bubbles and the distance between bubbles.
By assuming that those bubbles keep being spherically
symmetric and the surrounding liquid is incompressible,
the scattered pressure can be estimated with [6]

where ρ is the density of the liquid, r1j is the distance
between the centers of bubble 1 and bubble j, Rj is the
radius of bubble j, and the dot denotes the time deriva-
tive.

When the compressibility of the material surround-
ing the bubbles is completely negligible, one can use the
RPNNP equation [8]:

and

In this section, some basic properties of Eqs. (4) and
(5) are discussed by means of linear theory. By as-
suming that the bubble pulsation can be represented

A. Eigenfrequencies of the linear system of equations

Let us analyze in detail the eigenfrequencies of the lin-
ear coupled system, although a brief discussion is shown
in Ref. [2]. When only one bubble exists in an acoustic
ﬁeld and the frequency of the external sound is equiva-
lent to the resonance frequency of the bubble, the phase
diﬀerence between the bubble pulsation and the exter-
nal sound becomes π/2, as is well known. According
to this analogy, we call the frequency of an external
sound an eigenfrequency of the linear coupled system
when the phase diﬀerence between pex and e1 (or pex and
e2) becomes π/2. We assume that the external sound
pressure at the bubble position is written in a form of
pex =
Pa sin ωt. A harmonic steady-state solution of
the linear coupled system is

Equation (14) corresponds to that given in Ref. [2], and
is symmetric; namely, exchanging 1 and 2 (or 10 and 20)
on the subscripts of variables in this equation yields the
same equation. This means that two bubbles have the
same eigenfrequencies.

the case where both A1 = 0 and B1 = 0 are true.

should be noted also that F 2 + G2 appearing in the dom-

line denotes the line of ωj /ω10 = 1.

This converges to ω2
20 for an inﬁnite D and increases with
decreasing D. In contrast with Eq. (14), Eq. (15) is asym-
metric; namely this serves to break the symmetry of the
Zabolotskaya’s result mentioned above.

The present results show that, when the viscous eﬀect
of the surrounding liquid is negligible and the radii of the
bubbles are not equivalent, the bubbles have three asym-
metric eigenfrequencies; one is the “fundamental eigen-
frequency” that converges to the partial resonance fre-
quency of a corresponding bubble for an inﬁnite D, and
the remaining two are the “subeigenfrequencies” that
converge to the resonance frequency of a neighboring
bubble. One of the subeigenfrequencies always increases
as bubbles approach each other. The other subeigenfre-
quency decreases (increases) and the fundamental eigen-
frequency increases (decreases) when the partial reso-
nance frequency of the bubble is higher (lower) than that
of the neighboring bubble.

Now we discuss brieﬂy the case of identical bubbles.
When two bubbles have the same radii and pulsate in
phase, Eq. (6) is reduced to

This equation has only one eigenfrequency [2] of

≃

which converges to ω2
10 for inﬁnite D and decreases with
decreasing D. Using this example, we here carry out
quantitative comparison between the model used here
and previous ones. In Ref. [10], Kobelev and Ostrovskii
discussed the eigenfrequency of two interacting bubbles
by means of a mathematical model in which the sur-
face tension and viscosity are neglected and the poten-
tial ﬁeld forming between the bubbles is accurately de-
scribed by the method of images. The model predicts
= R20, as in Zabolot-
only two eigenfrequencies when R10
skaya’s model, and gives ω1 = √ln 2 ω10
0.832 ω10
when R10 = R20 and both bubbles make contact with
each other, i.e., D = 2R10. In Ref. [11], Zavtrak also dis-
cussed the eigenfrequency of the present case by means
of a mathematical model in which multiple scattering
between two bubbles is taken into account by the Leg-
endre polynomial expansion. In the case of D = 2R10,
0.832 ω10, which is in close
Zavtrak’s model gives ω1
≃
agreement with the result obtained by Kobelev and Os-
trovskii. However, Eq. (22) gives ω1
0.816 ω10 which is
lower by about 2 % than these values. This quantitative
discrepancy is caused from the diﬀerence of functions for
describing the scattered ﬁeld due to a bubble. The scat-
tered wave ﬁeld is assumed to be inversely proportional to
D in the model used here (See Eq. (2)), while those in the
models in Refs. [10,11] are approximated by an expansion
function. Namely, the amplitude of the scattered wave at
the position of a neighboring bubble is estimated diﬀer-
ently. The inﬂuence of this diﬀerence becomes stronger

small D. The radius of bubble 1 is ﬁxed to 10 µm and
that of bubble 2 varies from 5 µm to 15 µm. The eigen-
frequencies shown in those graphs are normalized with
the partial resonance frequency of bubble 1, ω10. As dis-
cussed above, three eigenfrequencies changing with the
distance between bubbles appear in each graph except for
the case of R10 = R20 where only one decreasing eigen-
frequency appears.
It should be noted that the larger
bubble, whose partial resonance frequency is lower than
that of the smaller bubble, has the highest eigenfrequency
among those of a pair of bubbles. This result is inconsis-
tent with the opinion represented in Refs. [3,4] in which it
is assumed that the eﬀective resonance frequency of the
smaller bubble rises faster than that of the larger bubble
when two bubbles approach each other.

×

Now we present numerical solutions of Eq. (13) for
examining the inﬂuences of viscosity on eigenfrequency.
Figures 2
4 show the results obtained by using µ =
−
10−3 kg/(m s) that corresponds to the viscos-
1.137
ity of water at room temperature. From those ﬁgures,
we can observe that, as the viscous eﬀect grows strong,
i.e., the mean radii of the two bubbles become smaller,
the subeigenfrequencies vanish gradually from the large-
distance region (and sometimes from the small-distance
region) and only the fundamental eigenfrequency re-
mains. In the case of R1 = 1 µm, the subeigenfrequencies
of a larger bubble disappear, and when the sizes of two
bubbles are close each other the fundamental eigenfre-
quency and the higher one of subeigenfrequencies of a
smaller bubble vanish in the small-distance region.

In the case of R1 = 0.1 µm, it is diﬃcult to distinguish
the subeigenfrequencies from the fundamental one since
only a smooth curve, which decreases monotonically with
decreasing l, appears in the graphs. (The eigenfrequency
of the smaller bubble remaining in the small-distance re-
gion may be the lower one of the subeigenfrequencies.)
This result means that in a high-viscosity case the ef-
fective resonance frequencies of both bubbles decrease
monotonically as l decreases.

These results show that the inﬂuence of the mutual in-
teraction on the eigenfrequencies depends on the viscos-
ity of the surrounding material and is weakened as the
viscous eﬀect becomes stronger, i.e., the threshold of the
distance for the appearance of the subeigenfrequencies is
shortened.

From the results shown in Fig. 2, we can expect that
when R1 = 10 µm, R2 = 8 µm, and ω = 1.4ω10, for
example, the signs of the primary Bjerknes force acting
on bubbles 1 and 2 change twice as the two bubbles ap-
proach each other since the curves shown in the ﬁgure for
this case close with the line ωj/ω10 = 1.4 (j = 1, 2) at
two points. We can expect also from the results shown
in Fig. 3 that when R1 = 1 µm, R2 = 0.8 µm, and
ω = 1.1ω10, the sign of the force acting on bubble 1
changes once during the approach since the curves for

Next, we brieﬂy discuss the amplitude of the bubble
pulsation. By substituting Eqs. (10) and (11) into Eq. (9)
and rearranging it, one obtains

cies of both bubbles and the viscous term is negligible,
Eq. (23) is reduced to

As D decreases, the amplitude K1 increases when ω20 >
ω, and decreases when ω20 < ω. Physically, this result
can be understood as follows: When ω20 is suﬃciently
larger than ω, the scattered wave due to bubble 2 os-
cillates in phase with the external sound. In this case,
the amplitude of the driving pressure acting on bubble
1 increases (See Eq. (6)); thus, the pulsation amplitude
of bubble 1 is increased. In contrast, when ω20 is suﬃ-
ciently smaller than ω, the scattered wave due to bubble
2 oscillates out of phase with the external sound; this
results in the decrease of the pulsation amplitude.

Now we consider the case where two bubbles have
the same radii and the frequency of the external sound
is equivalent to their partial resonance frequencies, i.e.,
R10 = R20 and ω = ω10 = ω20. This setting reduces
Eq. (23) to

This equation shows that the amplitude of the bubble
pulsation decreases with decreasing D. This result can be
explained as follows: The decrease of the eigenfrequency
represented in Eq. (22) causes the diﬀerence between the
sound frequency and the eﬀective resonance frequency;
resultantly, the amplitude of pulsation decreases. Such a
decrease in the pulsation amplitude of identical two small
near-resonance bubbles (R0 = 1.5 µm) in a viscous liquid
is shown in Ref. [12] by employing a direct-numerical-
simulation technique. The present theory may explain
the numerical result.

6

In this section, we show numerical results obtained by
using the full system of nonlinear equations [(4) and (5)]
and suﬃciently small amplitude of sound in order to ver-
ify the linear theory given in the last section. We in-
vestigate the variations in eigenfrequencies by observing
the primary Bjerknes force which is a time-averaged force
acting on a bubble when the external sound ﬁeld has a
spatial gradient. The primary Bjerknes force [13] is ex-
pressed as

Fj =

denotes the time average over a period of
where
the external sound. As was mentioned previously, the
phase diﬀerence between the external sound and the bub-
ble pulsation becomes π/2 when the sound frequency is
equivalent to the resonance frequency of a bubble.
In
this situation, furthermore, the primary Bjerknes force
vanishes as the result of the inner product by Eq. (25).
This means that we can observe the eigenfrequencies of
interacting bubbles by examining the conditions under
which the magnitude of the force becomes zero.

Here we assume that the external standing wave ﬁeld

is in a form of

pex(z, t) =

Pa(z) sin(ωt)

−
with Pa(z) = Ps sin(kz), where z is the spatial coordinate
vertical to the pressure nodes, Pa(z) is the amplitude of
the standing wave ﬁeld at z, and k is the wave number
of the standing wave ﬁeld. This assumption yields

pex(z, t) = k

where z is the unit vector in the z direction. Substitution
of Eq. (26) into Eq. (25) results in

where zj is the position of bubble j in the z coordi-
nate. The method for computing the force is the same
as what used in Refs. [6,7]. The full system of nonlin-
ear equations of (4) and (5) is solved numerically by
the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, and fj is then com-
puted with Rj given by the numerical computation. The
time average in Eq. (27) is done over a suﬃciently large
period after the transition has decayed. Here we as-
sume that the wavelength of the external sound is much
larger than the distance between the bubbles, and thus,
pex(z1, t) = pex(z2, t).

l curves for the cases of R10 = 10
µm, R10 = 1 µm and R10 = 0.1 µm, respectively. Here
the system of Eqs. (4) and (5) is used; namely, the com-
pressibility of the surrounding material is neglected. The
amplitude of the external sound at the bubble position is
assumed as Pa = 0.001P0, 0.01P0 and 0.1P0 for R10 = 10
µm, 1 µm and 0.1 µm cases, respectively. The frequency
ω of the external sound is set to 0.9ω10 and 1.4ω10 for
R10 = 10 µm, 0.95ω10 and 1.1ω10 for R10 = 1 µm, and
0.8ω10 for R10 = 0.1 µm. In those graphs, we can observe
some points where the primary Bjerknes force vanishes.
The normalized distances at the points, given theoret-
ically by solving Eq. (13) as a function of D with the
given ω, are listed in the captions of those ﬁgures. These
theoretical values are in good agreement with the numeri-
cal ones represented in those graphs. This result conﬁrms
our prediction that the sign of the primary Bjerknes force
changes at distances where one of the eigenfrequencies
becomes equivalent to the sound frequency.

eral authors [2–4]. It was shown also that the eigenfre-
quencies depend also on the viscosity of the bubbles’ sur-
rounding material, unlike the partial normal frequency.
Moreover, the present theory was veriﬁed numerically by
observing the primary Bjerknes force acting on bubbles.
These present results may be reasonable for understand-
ing the reversal of sign of the secondary Bjerknes force
[2–4,6] and the pattern formations of bubbles or clus-
ters of them in an acoustic ﬁeld [1,5]. As was pointed
out in Sec. II A, Zabolotskaya’s theory predicts that both
bubbles interacting with each other have the same eigen-
frequencies. This result may give rise to simultaneous
phase changes of the bubbles, e.g., from in-phase to out-
of-phase with the external sound, and, as a result, may
deny the reversal of the sign. The asymmetric eigen-
frequencies derived in the present paper may be able to
describe the reversal of the sign more accurately. (This
subject will be discussed in a future paper.) Further-
more, these present results will also aﬀect understandings
on some related subjects such as acoustic localization [14]
and superresonances [15], which were investigated by em-
ploying a system containing only identical bubbles.

FIG. 7. fj − l curves for R10 = 0.1 µm and diﬀerent values
of R20. The sound frequency is ω = 0.8ω10 and the sound
amplitude is 0.1P0. The theoretical values of (l1, l2) given by

In the present study, the dependency of the eigenfre-
quencies of two mutually interacting bubbles on the dis-
tance between the bubbles was theoretically determined
concretely and in detail. The dependency is more intri-
cate than those predicted or assumed previously by sev-

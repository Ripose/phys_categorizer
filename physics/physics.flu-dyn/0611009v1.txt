(Received 2 February 2008)

The recent theoretical discovery of families of travelling wave solutions in pipe ﬂow
(Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Wedin & Kerswell 2004; Hof et al. 2004) at Reynolds numbers
lower than the transitional range naturally raises the question of their relevance to the
turbulent transition process. Here a series of numerical experiments are conducted in
which we look for the spatial signature of these travelling waves in transitionary ﬂows.
Working within a periodic pipe of 5 D (diameters) length, we ﬁnd that travelling waves
with low wall shear stresses (lower branch solutions) are on a surface which separates
initial conditions which uneventfully relaminarise and those which lead to a turbulent
evolution. Evidence for recurrent travelling wave visits is found in both 5 D and 10 D
long periodic pipes but only for those travelling waves with low-to-intermediate wall
shear stress and for less than about 10% of the time in turbulent ﬂow. Given this,
it seems unlikely that the mean turbulent properties such as wall shear stress can be
predicted as an expansion over the travelling waves in which their individual properties
are appropriately weighted. Rather, further dynamical structures such as periodic orbits
need to be isolated and included in any such expansion.

1. Introduction

Wall-bounded shear ﬂows are of tremendous practical importance yet their transition
to turbulence is still poorly understood. Typically, the laminar ﬂow solution is linearly
stable (e.g. plane Couette ﬂow, pipe ﬂow) or if linearly unstable only well beyond the
regime where transition occurs (e.g. channel ﬂow). As a result, transition is an abrupt
process triggered by a perturbation of suﬃcient amplitude. Generically, this could be ex-
pected to lead to an intermediate state of reduced symmetry but in fact the ﬂow always
immediately becomes temporally and spatially complicated. A recent new direction in
rationalising this phenomenon revolves around identifying alternative solutions (beyond
the laminar state) to the governing Navier-Stokes equations. In the past few years, such
solutions in the form of steady states or travelling waves have been found in plane Couette
ﬂow (Nagata 1990; Clever & Busse 1992, 1997; Waleﬀe 1998), channel ﬂow (Itano & Toh
2001; Waleﬀe 2001, 2003), an autonomous wall ﬂow (Jimenez & Simens 2001) and most
recently pipe ﬂow (Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Wedin & Kerswell 2004). Invariably, these
solutions are saddle points in phase space. The idea is that through their stable and
unstable manifolds and interconnections between them together with the appearance of
periodic orbits, phase space becomes suﬃciently complicated to support ’turbulent’ tra-
jectories.

R. R. Kerswell and O. R. Tutty

Gathering supporting evidence for this scenario is in its infancy especially for spatially-
extended systems but progress is being made. Eckhardt and coworkers have been central
in applying such dynamical systems ideas to transition to turbulence (e.g. Schmiegel & Eckhardt
(1997); Eckhardt et al. (2002); Faisst & Eckhardt (2004); Eckhardt et al. (2007)). Their
basic approach has been to focus on the statistics of many transition events rather than
speciﬁc examples and so far have been reasonably successful in rationalising the proper-
ties of reduced numerical models with known dynamical systems structures in phase space
(see Eckhardt et al. (2007) for a nice review). Complementary work has concentrated on
establishing connections between speciﬁc ﬂow behaviour and underlying nonlinear solu-
tions present. In channel ﬂow, for example, Itano and Toh (Itano & Toh 2001) interpret
wall turbulent ‘bursting’ events with ﬂow along the unstable manifold of a travelling wave
solution. They also managed to isolate a periodic-looking solution on the basin boundary
of the turbulence by continually adjusting a trajectory such that it neither relaminarised
or became turbulent (Toh & Itano 2003) (see Skufca et al. (2006) for an equivalent cal-
culation in a model system). Jimenez et al. (Jimenez et al. 2005) studied both channel
ﬂow and plane Couette ﬂow in an eﬀort to relate near-wall turbulent events to the large
number of known nonlinear solutions. They concluded that the turbulence stayed close
to the upper branch travelling waves as far as comparing simple statistics of the ﬂow
ﬁeld such as maximum (over space) wall-normal and streamwise components were con-
cerned. Other work has focussed upon identifying isolated periodic solutions directly
from numerically-integrated turbulent trajectories using a Newton-Raphson technique.
In both the case of plane Couette ﬂow (Kawahara & Kida 2001) and highly-symmetric
forced box turbulence (van Veen et al. 2006), the authors claim to ﬁnd one periodic orbit
which seems to share the same mean properties as the turbulent attractor.

In pipe ﬂow, the only work so far aiming to establish the physical relevance of the
recently-discovered travelling waves has been experimental (Hof et al. 2004, 2005). By
analysing the ﬂow structure across turbulent pipe ﬂow (both of ‘puﬀ’ and ‘slug’ type - see
Wygnanski & Champagne (1973)), good correspondence was found, at least occasionally,
with the outer symmetrically-arranged ring of fast ‘streaks’ (streamwise velocity anoma-
lies) which is one of the dominant features of the travelling waves. The match is less clear,
however, with regards to the complementary slow streaks centred around the pipe axis as
well as with the smaller cross-stream velocities (e.g. ﬁgs 2E and 2F of Hof et al. (2004)).
The purpose of this paper is to build on this work by carrying out a detailed quantitative
study which can explore how closely the travelling waves are reproduced or ‘visited’ in
phase space and the frequency of such visits using direct numerical simulations. If it
emerges that turbulent pipe ﬂow can be understood as an eﬀectively random switching
between the neighbourhoods of these travelling waves then an appropriately weighted
expansion across the ‘active’ travelling waves visited may provide a useful predictor of
the turbulent ﬂow properties. This presumes that some version of periodic orbit theory
developed in low dimensional dynamical systems (e.g. (Cvitanovic 1988; Artuso et al.
1990a,b)) may carry over to this very high (formally inﬁnite) dimensional setting.

The structure of the paper is as follows. §2 begins by brieﬂy describing the numerical
method used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations before discussing reasonable measures
chosen to quantify if, and how well, the ﬂow approaches a travelling wave (TW) solu-
tion. There is a certain amount of arbitrariness in this choice because the TWs are fully
nonlinear solutions not obviously orthogonal under any inner product. Hence some exper-
imentation has been necessary before a ﬁnal choice on the exact ‘correlation’ functions to
evaluate made. Given also the fact that the TWs are parameterised continuously by their

Recurrence of Travelling Waves

axial wavelength (albeit over a ﬁnite range), it has been convenient to impose a strict
periodicity in the pipe to discretise the TWs which can exist in the system. As a result,
a periodic pipe of length 5D has been used for the majority of the results. Even then, 37
TWs of two-, three- and four-fold rotational symmetry about the axis can be found at a
Reynolds number of 2400. These are brieﬂy described in §3 together with their stability.
In §4, we show numerical evidence that some of the TWs are visited but not all and for
only part of the time. In §5, the statistical frequency of these visits is quantiﬁed by exam-
ining the correlation data from across a number of runs. Finally, a discussion follows in §6.

2. Formulation

2.1. Numerics

The Navier–Stokes equation and solenoidal condition for the ﬂow of an incompressible,
Newtonian ﬂuid along a circular, straight pipe under the action of an imposed pressure
gradient are

∂tu + u.∇u +

∇p = ν∇

2u,

∇.u = 0,

(2.1)

1
ρ

where ν is the kinematic viscosity, p the pressure and ρ the constant density. Non-
dimensionalising the system using U the mean axial speed and the pipe radius D/2 where
D is the diameter gives rise to the Reynolds number Re := U D/ν. A constant mass ﬂow
ﬂow rate - or equivalently Re - is maintained along the pipe at all times. A numerical
solution for the primitive variables (velocity and pressure) was developed in cylindrical
coordinates (s, θ, z) using ﬁnite diﬀerences in the radial direction (s) and Fourier modes
for z and θ. The time stepping was performed using the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme
of Nikitin (2006).

Hereafter a quoted numerical resolution of (N, M, K) corresponds to N + 1 equally-
spaced radial points (i.e. a grid step of 1/N where 0 ≤ s ≤ 1) and Fourier expansions in
θ and z of wavenumbers −M/2, ..., M/2 and (−K/2, ..., K/2)π/L respectively where L
diameters is the nominal length over which periodicity is imposed. As discussed below,
the main choice of pipe length was L = 5: for this geometry a coarse grid was (25,32,30),
an intermediate grid (50,48,40) and a ﬁne grid (50,60,60): equivalent grids in longer pipes
were used (e.g. a ﬁne 10D-grid was (50,60,120)).

In addition to checks of speciﬁc components of the code using analytic test solutions,
a series of calculations was performed using as initial conditions a TW solution plus a
perturbation in the form of the leading (unstable) eigenfunction. Good agreement was
obtained for the growth of the disturbance and that predicted from the eigenvalue. Im-
portantly, the code was also cross-validated with another time-stepping code based on
velocity potentials (Willis & Kerswell 2006).

Commonly in studies of this type the grid is stretched in the radial direction as the
highest resolution is required near the wall. However, here there was little diﬀerence be-
tween the results obtained with uniform and non-uniform grids. This is not surprising
given the nature of the ﬂow at the Reynolds number considered in this study, as can be
seen in Figure 3 below.

2.2. Travelling Waves

The TWs so far identiﬁed (Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Wedin & Kerswell 2004) are arranged
into symmetry classes of m-fold rotational symmetry about the axis and then continu-
ously parametrised by their axial wavenumber across a ﬁnite range. TWs of 1-fold through
to 6-fold symmetry have been found (Kerswell 2005) but only 2-, 3- and 4-fold TWs are
currently known to exist below Re = 2485. Within each symmetry class, the TWs ap-
pear through saddle node bifurcations so that close to the saddle node point there is a
well-deﬁned upper and lower branch solution for a given wavenumber. For higher Re,
the solution surfaces typically kink and fold back on themselves so that multiple pairs of
branches can coexist at the same wavenumber (e.g. ﬁgure 10 of Wedin & Kerswell (2004)).

Imposing a pipe periodicity immediately reduces the continuum of TWs present down
to a discrete number which can ﬁt into the pipe. This is a crucial simpliﬁcation which
means the matching procedure adopted below can monitor all the TWs available to the
ﬂow. The main choice of a 5D long pipe was a compromise between the need to keep the
number of TWs to a manageable size (helped by a shorter pipe) and the need to have a
dynamical system which could support turbulent behaviour at a value of Re where the
TWs are fully resolvable (helped by a longer pipe). This pipe length has also been studied
before (Eggels et al. 1994; Faisst & Eckhardt 2004) and sustained turbulence predicted
for Re > 2250 (Faisst & Eckhardt 2004). This short length, of course, precludes captur-
ing turbulent spatiotemporal features such as ‘puﬀs’ (Wygnanski & Champagne 1973)
which typically extend over 20D but does allow an examination of ‘temporal’ turbulence
which, when triggered, ﬁlls the whole pipe.

Figures 1 and 2 show the result of tracing out all the 2-,3- and 4-fold solution branches
in the friction factor-axial wavelength plane at Re = 2400 where the friction factor
(Schlichting 1968) is deﬁned as

Λ := −

(2.2)

with dp/dz being the mean pressure gradient. The curves are similar but less contorted
at Re = 2000 (Kerswell 2005) and Re = 2200 (not shown). The vertical dotted lines
drawn at axial wavenumbers α = 0.625n where n = 1, 2, ...5 indicate the TWs which ﬁt
in the pipe which is actually taken to be π/0.625 = 5.0265 diameters long. The m-fold
symmetry class, the letter label and wavenumber are used to identify the TWs in what
follows. For example, the TW with wavenumber 1.25 and lowest friction factor in ﬁgure 1
is the 3b 1.25 TW. For this pipe geometry and Re, there are 37 TWs (6 2-fold, 22 3-fold
and 9 4-fold rotationally symmetric TWs) which can be numerically resolved and used
to match against the ﬂow.

2.3. Matching

As fully nonlinear solutions, the TWs do not possess any simple orthogonality with
respect to an inner product. Therefore establishing when a directly numerically simulated
ﬂow, uDN S, approaches a chosen TW velocity ﬁeld, uT W , is not a straightforward case
of projection. Given this, a number of ad-hoc ‘correlation’ functions were developed and
tested to measure how close the ﬂow comes momentarily to a TW. The basic approach was
to construct an integral based on the velocity ﬁelds uDN S and uT W over one wavelength
2π/α of the TW near the middle of the pipe. The correlation functions found most useful

is the (usual) inner product.

The second measure Iuv is necessary as the TW streamwise (streak) velocities are
typically an order of magnitude larger than the cross-stream velocities and hence their
matching contribution tends to dominate Itot, to the extent that there is little diﬀerence
between Itot and Iw (the equivalent of Iuv but using the streamwise velocity component
only), even though the mean ﬂow has been subtracted. A correlation using the full ve-
locity ﬁelds vDN S and vT W is not a sensible measure as it is dominated by the mean
streamwise ﬂow to the extent that all correlations involving the axial velocity would be
large.

Recurrence of Travelling Waves

By design, Itot and Iuv can only take values in the interval [−1, 1] with a value 1
indicating a perfect match. The phase optimisation over θ0 and z0 (carried out by sys-
tematically evaluating all the options over the [0, 2π) × [−π/α, π/α) grid) in practice
ensured that the correlations were never very negative typically lying in the interval
[−0.2, 0.2]. Experience indicated that there is evidence for a TW visit if Itot and Iuv
reach values of 0.5 and above (although more on this below).

A number of other measures were tried. An inner product using the streamwise vortic-
ity, which provides a single measure of the cross stream ﬂow, was found to shadow Iuv,
although at a lower level. The symmetry assumed for the TW’s (see 2.7 below) ensures
that the cross stream velocity is zero along the axis of the pipe. This would not be ex-
pected to occur over an extended length of the pipe in fully turbulent ﬂow. Hence an inner
product over a subset of the domain excluding the central portion could be suitable. This
was investigated, and it was found that restricting the domain to 1
2 ≤ s ≤ 1 produced
somewhat higher higher correlations, particularly for Iuv, but, again, a similar pattern of
behaviour. Hence, these other measures could be used to produce essentially the same re-
sults by adjusting the level of correlation that would be regarded as giving a good match.

The matching was performed by maximising the value of Iuv over all possible values
of θ0 and z0. Itot was then calculated for the same orientation. Itot is not suitable as
the primary measure as it is so heavily dominated by the streamwise component that
the cross-stream structure of the ﬂow would, in eﬀect, be discounted when choosing the
“best” match.

Some of the TW’s are highly correlated (values greater then 0.95 have been observed),
so that, at a speciﬁc time, using these measures, there can be a good match of the ﬂow
to more than one TW. In cases such as this, the value of the mean wall shear stress and
the perturbation kinetic energy can be used to select the most appropriate match.

2.4. Travelling Wave Stability
An obvious way to start the DN S runs is to use a TW together with some small pertur-
bation as an initial condition. If this perturbation is unstructured, for example, by relying
on numerical discretization errors, the ﬂow takes a long time to exit the neighbourhood
of the TW and wastes cpu time. A better strategy is to ﬁnd the unstable eigendirections
of the TW and to use the most unstable eigenfunction with a small amplitude as the
perturbation. Four ‘lower’ branch TWs - 2b 1.25, 3a 2.5,3h 2.5 and 4b 3.125 - and four
‘upper’ branch TWs - 2a 1.25, 3b 3.125, 3j 2.5 and 4c 3.125 - were selected as starting
TWs. The distinction between upper or lower branch solutions can be ambiguous when
the solution surface is as convoluted as in ﬁgure 1. Here we consider that TWs with high
friction factors are upper branch solutions and those with low friction factor are lower
branch solutions. The 8 choices made represent extreme and therefore unambiguous ex-
amples under this categorisation.

The stability properties of the 8 chosen TWs are listed in Table 1. The travelling waves

all possess the shift-&-reﬂect symmetry S

S : (s, θ, z) → (s, −θ, z + π/α),

S : (u, v, w, p) → (u, −v, w, p).

(2.7)

so permitted linear disturbances can either be partitioned into those symmetric or an-
tisymmetric with respect to S. When checked the TWs were invariably stable to an-

tisymmetric disturbances so Table 1 concentrates exclusively on the situation in the
S-symmetric subspace. The number of unstable directions is strikingly small given the
large degrees of freedom involved (e.g. O(15, 000)) and the size of the growth rates -
O(0.1 U/D) indicate inertial instabilities. Figure 3 shows the structure of the most un-
stable eigenfunctions for the lower branch TWs 2b 1.25 and 3a 2.5. The 3a 2.5 TW gives
a particularly clear example of how an unstable eigenfunction is concentrated in the re-
gions of maximum shear in the TW streak velocity.

3. Results

A series of runs were performed by taking as initial conditions each of the selected 8
upper and lower TWs perturbed by a small amount of their most unstable eigenfunc-
tion. Since this perturbation can be added or subtracted, 16 runs were in fact done.
This protocol highlighted a fundamental diﬀerence between the upper and lower branch
TWs. For all the lower branch TWs tested, starting the run in one sense along the TW’s
most unstable manifold invariably led to an uneventful gradual relaminarisation, whereas
starting in the other sense always produced a turbulent evolution. Both signs of pertur-
bation, in contrast, produced a turbulent trajectory for the upper branch TWs. This
implies that the 4 lower branch TWs (and by implication other lower branch TWs) and
their stable manifolds are part of a boundary dividing regions of phase space which lead
to the two diﬀerent types of behaviour. Their unstable manifolds are then either directed
towards the laminar or turbulent states normal to this bounding surface. The terminol-
ogy ‘basin of attraction’ and ’separatrix’ has purposely been avoided here as the second
initial observation when doing these runs at Re = 2400 with a 5D pipe is that the turbu-
lence is only transitory. In other words, the laminar state is still the global attractor at
Re = 2400 in a 5D periodic pipe although the ﬂow can experience a long but ultimately
ﬁnite turbulent episode. Not surprisingly, the length of these turbulent transients seems
to depend sensitively on the exact numerical resolution used. This is particularly true

axial velocity is set to the largest absolute contour level (the shading outside the pipe indicates
0: contours levels range from

0.417U to 0.266U in 8 steps).

with regards to the azimuthal and axial resolution - reducing this too far can produce
what looks to be sustained turbulence (e.g. turbulence remains transient when reducing
the resolution from the working resolution (50, 60, 60) to (25, 30, 30) or (50, 24, 24) but
looks to be sustained at (50, 16, 16) over a time greater than 3, 000D/U : the resolution
of Faisst & Eckhardt (2004) which predicts sustained turbulence at Re = 2250 is some-
where in between these last two choices). The issue of exactly when (or indeed if!) pipe
ﬂow turbulence becomes sustained is an area of much current interest at the moment
(Peixinho & Mullin 2006; Hof et al. 2006; Willis & Kerswell 2006).

for the ﬂow evolution together with all 37 of the TWs present. Strictly when comparing
with values for a TW, the kinetic energy and mean wall shear should be calculated for
the section of the pipe containing the best match. However, for a pipe of this length,
ﬂow structures tend to persist over the full length of the pipe, particularly in the near
wall region containing the streaks. The wall shear stress depends only on the streamwise
velocity, which also provides the dominant component of the kinetic energy perturbation.
As a result, there is usually little diﬀerence in these quantities for the full pipe and a
section corresponding to one of the travelling waves. Larger diﬀerences were observed in
longer pipes.

For one sign of the eigenfunction perturbation, the ﬂow tamely relaminarises while for
the other it executes a long turbulent transient. During this latter evolution, there is
evidence of close visits to at least 5 TWs. The ﬁrst (labelled ’1’ in ﬁgure 4) is to 4f 3.125
and occurs during the early stages as the ﬂow trajectory moves away from 4b 3.125: see
ﬁgure 5. This quality of the match is extremely high suggesting that there may be a het-
eroclinic connection between the two TWs. The fact that even at t = 0 there is already
a considerable correlation with 4f 3.125 indicates that 4b 3.125 is structurally similar to
4f 3.125, an observation which is also true for some other groupings of TWs within the
same rotational symmetry class. Figure 5 also shows the correlation signal for 4c 3.125
which has a very close visit after 120 D/U (labelled ’4’). Taken together, the correlation
functions for the other 4-fold TWs indicate that the ﬂow retains its 4-fold symmetry
until about 130 D/U (this was veriﬁed by examining the transient solution), whereupon
it switches to a predominantly 3-fold symmetry. Figure 6 shows this switch-over well via
the correlation function Itot for 3a 3.125. This TW is the best candidate for a close visit
(labelled ‘5’ at t ∼ 250 D/U ) over all the 3-fold symmetric TWs. Figure 7 shows how
the contribution to the correlation functions vary over the matching wavelength at point
‘5’. The total correlation Itot is uniformly high but Iuv is low indicating that there is
probably a good match in the streak structure but not in the cross-stream velocities.
This is conﬁrmed in ﬁgure 8 where there is clear evidence of 3 equally-spaced fast streaks
around the outside of the pipe like 3a 3.125 which are fairly streamwise independent.
Surprisingly, there is little similarity between the inner slow streak structures. The axial
vorticity is a convenient but particularly discriminating way of probing the cross-stream
velocity ﬁelds as it involves taking derivatives. Given the low value of Iuv, the poor
comparison is expected however there is evidence that the DNS ﬂow and the TW have
roughly the same wavelength of variation.

During the dominantly 4-fold symmetric phase, there is also evidence for visits to
2b 0.625 and 2a 1.25 (labelled ’2’ and ’3’) shown in ﬁgure 9. A further way to charac-
terise the extent of all these visits is to compare the kinetic energy and wall shear stress
of the ﬂow across the length of the pipe used for matching with the values associated
with the TW. This data is collected together in ﬁgure 4. The relative closeness of these
points to the corresponding values for the TW (e.g. ‘5’ and 3a 3.125) is further support-

ing evidence of a visit.

Runs started at upper branch TWs with either sign of unstable eigenfunction lead to
turbulent-looking trajectories. Figure 10 shows one of these runs starting with 3b 3.125.
Just as in the case of 4b 3.125, the initial rotational symmetry of the ﬂow lingers for a
substantial time. During this phase, there is clear evidence of close visits to 3b 2.5, 3c 2.5
and 3j 2.5 (see ﬁgure 11). The ﬁrst visit is particularly signiﬁcant as the structural over-
lap between the initial TW (3b 3.125) and the visited TW (3b 2.5) is low: by point ‘1’,
both Itot and Iuv for 3b 2.5 have risen from ≈ 0.4 to near 0.8 in just over 50 D/U .
Figure 12, which compares the initial condition, the DNS ﬂow at point ‘1’ and the TW
3b 2.5, conﬁrms that the ﬂow makes a signiﬁcant adjustment to match with the new TW.

After a time of about 125 D/U - see Figure 13 - the ﬂow switches to being more 2-fold
symmetric. The ﬂow then successively visits 2a 1.25 and 2b 1.875 before relaminarising

and the TW 2a 1.25 because the correlation functions Itot and Iuv are simultaneously
large within the comparison wavelength: see Figure 14 at z ≈ 1.5. The velocity plots -
see Figure 15 - are very similar even up to the same vortex in the top left quadrant of
the cross-sectional snapshots.

In Figure 10 point 5 is ﬂagged as a match to TW 2b 1.875 as this TW has the largest
correlation to the ﬂow at this point, with Itot = 0.63 and Iuv = 0.61. However, this is
not the only TW that satisﬁes the criterion for a good match. Speciﬁcally, TW 2a 1.25
has Itot = 0.58 and Iuv = 0.49. Also, 2a 1.25 is closer to point 5 than 2b 1.875 in Figure
10. That both of these TW’s show a high correlation with the ﬂow is not surprising as
the TW’s also show a high correlation (matching 2b 1.875 to 2a 1.25 gives Itot = 0.53

and Iuv = 0.62). Figure 16 shows a comparison between the ﬂow at point 5 and the two
travelling waves. In general, Figure 16 suggests that there is better agreement between
TW 2a 1.25 and the ﬂow than 2b 1.875, despite the fact that it has a lower correlation
as measured by Itot and Iuv. That this can occur is not unexpected since Itot and Iuv
are measures of shape and not amplitude. Figure 16 and the position of the TW’s on
10 suggests there is a better agreement in amplitude between 2a 1.25 and the ﬂow than
with 2b 1.875.

No signiﬁcant correlations were found with any 4-fold TWs as the correlation func-
tions Itot ≤ 0.3 and Iuv ≤ 0.45 throughout the evolution. This was a persistent ﬁnding
in all the other runs where a 2-fold or 3-fold symmetric TW was used to initiate the
ﬂow. Even when the ﬂow was started by a 4-fold symmetric TW, correlations with other
4-fold symmetric TWs would only be signiﬁcant in the initial phase of the ﬂow evolution

where the seeding symmetry is still present. In contrast, certain 2-fold and 3-fold TWs
were consistently visited regardless of how the ﬂow was initiated. The fact that the 4-
fold symmetric TWs have a higher wall-shear-stress-to-kinetic-energy ratio than the ﬂow
seems to adopt is indicated by ﬁgures 4 and 10 and equivalent plots for other starting
TWs (not shown). The ﬂow never seems to visit the part of phase space where the 4-fold
TWs are unless speciﬁcally inserted whereas some of the 2-fold and 3-fold symmetric
TWs are in the active part of phase space populated by turbulent trajectories.

Information about which TWs are visited in each of the 12 turbulent runs is sum-
marised in Tables 2 and 3. The criterion used to indicate a visit is Itot > λ and
Itot + Iuv > 2λ with λ = 0.5 and λ = 0.6 for a closer visit. There is a strong corre-
lation between the rotational symmetry of the starting TW and the waves subsequently
visited even when the initial transient - deﬁned as the period when Itot for the initial
TW decreases (typically of O(30 D/U ) in duration) - is not considered. For instance, runs
1,2,5 and 10 - see Table 2 - show no evidence of visits to TWs with diﬀerent rotational
symmetry. However, across this suite of runs, all the TWs are visited at least once except
for the 3 TWs 3a 1.25, 3b 1.25 and 3c 1.25. Table 3 shows the more discerning results
of only considering times when the ﬂow leaves the rotational symmetry class of the ini-
tial TW. Examples of when this occurs have already been discussed in run 4 (at about
130 D/U : see Figure 6) and in run 7 (at about 125 D/U ; See Figure 13). This makes it
particularly clear that the 4-fold rotationally symmetric TWs are never visited except
when the run is speciﬁcally started near one of these TWs (runs 4, 11 and 12) whereas
2-fold and 3-fold symmetric TWs are visited regardless of the starting symmetry (e.g.
runs 3, 6, 7, 9).

3.1. Frequency of Visits
Given the evidence above that the TWs are visited, the next question is how frequently.
To answer this, ‘visit’ statistics were compiled across a number of diﬀerent runs which

exhibited turbulent episodes. Ideally, these should be composed from one very long - e.g.
O(10, 000 D/U ) - turbulent run but, as discussed already, none could be generated at
this Re where the TWs are available. As a result, two strategies at quantifying the TW
visit frequency were undertaken. The ﬁrst involved piecing together all the turbulent
episodes produced during the suite of 5D runs described above. The second was to gen-
erate longer turbulent data sets in a double-length 10D pipe; for relatively short pipes,
the length of pipe appears to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the time turbulence is sustained
for, as can be seen from Table 4. These latter runs were almost exclusively initiated by
randomly-selected velocity ﬁelds taken from a long turbulent coarse-grid run: see Table
4. The coarse grid is too underresolved to reproduce the TWs accurately and hence cal-
culate correlation functions directly but was perfectly adequate to initiate turbulence in

ﬁner grid runs.

For the 5D runs started at a TW, it was necessary to decide when the ﬂow had left
the neighbourhood of the TW and had started to behave in a turbulent fashion. Two
diﬀerent criteria were adopted for this. In the ﬁrst (data set A), the start of the turbulent
phase was taken as the time at which the correlation with the starting TW had reached
a minimum. This turned out to be more stringent a criterion (i.e. produced a later time)
than requiring that the ﬂow trajectory merely enter the part of the KE−τ plane occupied
by the turbulent state. In the second (data set B), the start of the turbulent phase was
taken as when the ﬂow broke out of the initial rotational symmetry class of the starting
TW (e.g. for run 4 this occurs at about 130 D/U : see Figure 6). In both cases the end of
the turbulent phase was well estimated by when the ﬂow trajectory left this ‘turbulent’
KE − τ area. The subsequent relaminarisation phase was easily identiﬁed with both the
perturbation kinetic energy and wall stress decaying monotonically down to their lami-
nar values (e.g. see ﬁgures 4 and 10). These strategies produced a correlation data sets
lasting 4, 154 D/U (A) and 2, 363 D/U (B). For each, a joint probability density function
was then computed for Itot and Iuv corresponding to the TW with largest Itot at a given

time: see ﬁgures 17 and 18. There is a clear positive correlation between Itot and Iuv
and signiﬁcant evidence for recurrent TW visits. Comparing the two pdfs, there are a
lot of close visits during the interval after the initial transient but before the rotational
symmetry class of the ﬂow changes. This is presumably the result of the ﬂow percolating
out of the speciﬁc TW region in which it is initially inserted. As a result, the pdf from
data set A is likely to overestimate the visit frequency.

Using the criterion that a visit occurs if Itot > λ & Itot + Iuv > 2λ, the percentage
visit time is plotted against the quality of the visit λ in Figure 19. To assess how close
a visit needs to be - i.e. what λ is required - to be able to predict the instantaneous
wall shear stress, Figures 20 and 21 plot the instantaneous DNS wall stress (over the
matching wavelength) against the wall shear stress associated with the visited TW for

three diﬀerent values of λ. The choice of seeking maximal Itot to identify the closest
TW was taken to facilitate the comparison as this should provide the best match be-
tween the DNS streak structure at the pipe wall with that of the TW. Even with this,
the correlation results for set A indicate that only λ ≥ 0.7 level visits are really good
enough to start making predictions of the wall shear stress from the visited TW. Since
there are no λ = 0.7 visits in set B, λ = 0.6 is used to indicate closer visits and better
stress correlation is evident at this level compared to the λ = 0.5 results. Since the ab-
scissa is discretized over the 37 τT W values, each vertical strip of data in these ﬁgures
indicates that that TW has been visited. Interestingly, Figure 20 shows a visit bias to
TWs with larger wall stress (≤ −6 ∗ 2ρU 2/Re) whereas Figure 21 is oppositely skewed
(≥ −6 ∗ 2ρU 2/Re) to lower wall stress TWs. A possible explanation for this is set A is
dominated in a 2-to-1 ratio with runs started by upper branch TWs compared to lower

branch TWs. In the initial adjustment phase where the ﬂow trajectory gradually leaves
the vicinity of the initial TW, the ﬂow visits other TWs and these are more likely to
be upper rather than lower branch solutions in the neighbourhood of an initial upper
branch solution. The reason lower branch TWs feature more in set B may be because the
turbulent episodes considered were not long enough to desensitise the visit statistics from
the ﬁnal relaminarisation process where the ﬂow preferentially passes by lower branch
TWs. This could indicate that eﬀorts to remove this phase from the data but may not
have been wholly successful.

Further runs were carried out in a 2π/0.625 D (≈ 10 D) pipe in the search for more
sustained turbulent data. Extending the spatial domain by a factor of 2 allows a whole
new set of TW wavelengths to ﬁt into the pipe, roughly doubling the number of allowed
TWs. The correlation calculations were not extended to encompass this enlarged set
for two reasons. Firstly the new TWs are interspersed within the 5D set which already
sample the available solutions well. Therefore the new TWs should have structures very
similar to the existing TW set. Secondly, the increase in the numerical overhead: cur-
rently calculating the correlation functions takes around 50% of the cpu time. However
to compensate for this omission, the visit frequencies based on half the admissible TWs
could justiﬁably be doubled. Initial conditions were randomly selected from an apparently
sustained coarse turbulent run and used in intermediate- and ﬁne-grid runs: see Table 4.
The statistics across the accumulated 5, 865 D/U long intermediate grid turbulent data
were similar to those across the accumulated 4, 780 D/U long ﬁne grid turbulent data so
the sets were merged to give a one large data set over 10, 000 D/U in duration. The joint
pdf of (Itot, Iuv) shown in Figure 24 resembles that from 5D data set B as does the wall
stress comparison during visits shown in Figure 25. Again, the most visited TWs look
to be those with lower wall stresses and essentially the same subset of TWs are visited
closely - 2a 1.25, 2b 1.875 and 3b 2.5 in 5D data compared to 2a 1.25, 2b 1.875, 3b 2.5
and 3c 3.125 in the 10D data. Figures 22 and 23 show an example of a visit to 2a 1.25

2a 1.25 (right). The top row shows the velocity ﬁelds for the TW’s at the streamwise position of
maximum correlation, the middle row the DNS ﬂow, and the bottom row the wall shear stress
at the same position. The shading represents the axial velocity perturbation from laminar ﬂow
with contours from -0.55 (dark) to 0.5 (light) (right column), -0.4 to 0.2 (top left), and -0.7
to 0.65 (middle left), with a step of 0.15. The arrows indicate the cross stream velocity, scaled
on magnitude (maximum 0.162 U ). For the wall shear stress, the top lines show the azimuthal
stress (in units of 2ρU 2/Re), and the bottom lines axial stress (minus the laminar value of
4).
The regular lines with 2-fold symmetry are for the TW’s and the more irregular lines are from
the DNS solution.

TWs were visited in the 10D runs reinforcing the observation made in the 5D work that
these TWs are not in the same part of phase space as that populated by a turbulent ﬂow.

Figure 19 brings together the results of the frequency analysis by comparing the visit
percentage as a function of visit quality (λ) for the three data sets. Doubling the 10D
frequency data (as only half the possible TWs are considered) brings the observed visit
frequency more into line with the results from the 5D data set B at λ = 0.5. Taken
together, they suggest that TWs are visited for approximately 10% of the time in tur-
bulent pipe ﬂow. Using Itot > λ as the criterion for a visit would increase the frequency
of visits, by, in eﬀect, ignoring the cross-stream component of the ﬂow and considering
the streamwise (streak) structure only.

Figure 26 shows the perturbation kinetic energy and the mean wall shear stress for a
10D pipe for one of the intermediate and ﬁne grid runs started from coarse grid turbulent
data. This shows that the turbulent ﬂow in this pipe is concentrated in a small patch of
the KE − τ space, with both grids occupying the same region of the space. The other
intermediate and ﬁne grid turbulent runs are also concentrated in this region. Coarse grid
turbulent runs occupy a somewhat diﬀerent region of the KE − τ space with lower values

of both variables. Both the intermediate and ﬁne grid have the same radial resolution
(N = 50). A test run was performed with the same grid in θ and z as the intermediate
grid but an increased resolution in s (N = 75). Again, the ﬂow occupied the same region
in the KE − τ space.

Figure 27 shows power spectra of the surplus kinetic energy and the wall shear stress
for turbulent ﬂow in a 10D pipe. The spectra were generated by taking the data for the
four longest ﬁne grid runs that were started from coarse grid turbulent data, with a sam-
ple time of 782.1 D/U . A Hanning window was applied, with the windowed data scaled
so that the variance matches that of the original data, and the spectra were generated by
averaging over the four samples. Interestingly, the spectra show a peak, corresponding
to a period of approximately 98 D/U which suggests a periodic orbit embedded in the
turbulent dynamics †. This is currently under investigation.

The intermediate grid data produced spectra consistent with those for the ﬁne grid, while

†

the coarse grid also produced a peak, but at a higher frequency.

Figure 19. The percentage of time a turbulent ﬂow ’visits’ a TW based on the criterion Itot > λ
and Itot +Iuv > 2λ as a function of λ. Statistics gathered from the 5D runs started at a TW with
a) only the initial transient subtracted (dashed red line) and b) considering only times where
the ﬂow has left the initial symmetry class of the TW (solid red line with dots on), together
with turbulent data compiled from various runs at 10D (blue solid line with crosses on).

4. Discussion

At this point it is worth cataloguing the achievements of this investigation.

(a) Using the travelling waves already known as starting points, all travelling wave
solutions (TWs) of varying wavelengths and azimuthal symmetries which exist at Re =
2400 have been traced out (Figures 1 and 2). They naturally partition into 3 distinct
classes of particular rotational symmetry about the axis - 2-fold, 3-fold and 4-fold sym-
metric TWs - and 37 in total ﬁt into a π/0.625 ( ≈ 5) D periodic pipe.

(b) The linear stability of four ‘lower branch’ TWs (TWs with some of the lowest wall
stresses of the 37) and four ‘upper branch’ solutions (TWs with the some of the highest
wall stresses of the 37) has been carried out. All are inertially unstable and therefore
saddles in phase space with growth rates typically of the size O(0.1 U/D) and all have
very low dimensional unstable manifolds.

(c) All the lower branch solutions considered appear to sit on a surface which separates
initial conditions which uneventfully relaminarise and those which lead to a turbulent-
looking evolution. In contrast, initial conditions near all the upper branch solutions tested

Figure 20. A plot of the wall shear stress τDNS versus the wall shear stress τT W of the TW
being visited (τDNS is measured across the matching wavelength of the TW) for the 5D data
set A runs. The visit criterion is Itot > λ & Itot + Iuv > 2λ, where λ = 0.5 (red dots) indicate
approximate visits, λ = 0.7 (blue circles) close visits and λ = 0.9 (black squares) very close visits.
The thick (black) diagonal dashed line indicates a perfect match τDNS = τT W . The horizontal
(blue) dashed line is the mean wall shear stress across the whole pipe, the dotted lines indicate
one standard deviation either side of this mean and the limits of the vertical axis have been
set to the maximum (-12.8) and minimum (-5.2) wall shear stress values (in units of 2ρU 2/Re).

invariably become turbulent.

(d) Turbulence in a 5D periodic pipe at Re = 2400 may be long-lived but ultimately
appears only transient. Turbulence also seems transient in a 10D pipe at Re = 2400 but
the transients have, on average, a longer life. The mean lifetime of a turbulent episode
is sensitive to the numerical resolution used, with turbulence appearing to last longer, if
not sustained, in underresolved calculations.

(e) A number of diﬀerent correlation functions were experimented with to measure
how ‘close’ a given velocity ﬁeld is to a TW. Two, Itot and Iuv, were chosen and a visit
criterion - Itot > λ and Itot + Iuv > 2λ - developed based on a ‘quality of visit’ param-
eter λ. After examining the velocity matches at various diﬀerent levels of λ, a value of
0.5 was taken as indicating a ‘visit’ with values of 0.6 and higher indicating a ‘close’ visit.

Figure 21. A plot of the wall shear stress τDNS versus the wall shear stress τT W of the TW
being visited (τDNS is measured across the matching wavelength of the TW) for the 5D data
set B runs. The visit criterion is Itot > λ & Itot + Iuv > 2λ, where λ = 0.5 (red dots) indicate
approximate visits, λ = 0.6 (blue circles) close visits. There are no very close (λ = 0.9) visits.
The thick (black) diagonal dashed line indicates a perfect match τDNS = τT W . The horizontal
(blue) dashed line is the mean wall shear stress across the whole pipe, the dotted lines indicate
one standard deviation either side of this mean and the limits of the vertical axis have been
set to the maximum (-9.6) and minimum (-5.3) wall shear stress values (in units of 2ρU 2/Re).
Each vertical strip of points represents one TW. For λ = 0.5, the TWs visited are 2a 1.25,
2b 1.875, 3b 2.5, 3a 3.125 and 3c 3.125. The TWs closely visited (λ = 0.6) are 2a 1.25, 2b 1.875
and 3b 2.5.

(f) Turbulent data in both 5D and 10D pipes indicate that some 2-fold and 3-fold
symmetric TWs are recurrently visited while others are not. In particular, no evidence
was found for visits to 4-fold symmetric TWs. The visited TWs correspond to low-to-
intermediate wall stress solutions which are embedded in the same part of phase space
as the turbulent dynamics. Other TWs are clearly in very diﬀerent phase space locations
and hence are never visited except if the ﬂow is speciﬁcally inserted there initially (e.g.
all the 4-fold TWs).

(g) Based on the correlation functions, Itot and Iuv, used and the visiting criterion
adopted (λ = 0.5), numerical evidence suggests that travelling waves are only visited for
about 10% of the time in turbulent pipe ﬂow.

The last ﬁnding answers the original motivating question for this study. The fact that
a turbulent ﬂow is apparently visiting a TW only 10% of the time implies that it is

of limited use to view turbulence as the random switching between the neighbourhoods
of TWs. From the perspective of, say, predicting the average turbulent wall stress, an
appropriately weighted sum of all the relevant TW wall stresses seems unlikely to work
given that so much time is spent away from the TWs in phase space. The fact that even
during a visit, the match between the ﬂows wall stress and that of the TW can be poor
is further cause for pessimism. The way out of this conclusion, of course, is that other
phase space objects such as periodic orbits - perhaps glimpsed in ﬁgure 27 - need to be
included in any such expansion. The results presented here indicate just how important
these missing objects are given the low visit times for the TWs and the next challenge
to isolate them seems clear.

Table 4. This Table lists the various runs used to produce the ‘visit’ statistics. The 5D data
comes from initiating the code with a disturbed TW and two ‘turbulent’ duration times are
listed. The ﬁrst is measured from when the ﬂow leaves the initial symmetry class of the TW
(used for data set B) whereas the second, larger ﬁgure (in parentheses) is based on when the
correlation function for the starting TW stops decreasing which is a much weaker condition
that occurs earlier (used for data set A). The 10D runs are almost exclusively started using
randomly selected velocity ﬁelds from a long turbulent run generated using a coarse (25,32,60)
grid (a strategy labelled as ‘T’ in the Table). Note that some of the 10D runs were still turbulent
when this data was gathered, whereas all the 5D runs had relaminarised.

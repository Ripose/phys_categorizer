We consider the release from a point source of relatively heavy ﬂuid into a porous sat-
urated medium above an impermeable slope. We consider the case where the volume of
the resulting gravity current increases with time like tα and show that for α < 3, at short
t(α+1)/4, while at long times
times the current spreads axisymmetrically, with radius r
it spreads predominantly downslope. In particular, for long times the downslope position
of the current scales like t while the current extends a distance tα/3 across the slope. For
α > 3, this situation is reversed with spreading occurring predominantly downslope for
short times. The governing equations admit similarity solutions whose scaling behaviour
we determine, with the full similarity form being evaluated by numerical computations
of the governing partial diﬀerential equation. We ﬁnd that the results of these analyses
are in good quantitative agreement with a series of laboratory experiments. Finally, we
brieﬂy discuss the implications of our work for the sequestration of carbon dioxide in
aquifers with a sloping, impermeable cap.

1. Introduction

Horizontal diﬀerences in density between two ﬂuids lead to the propagation of so-called
gravity currents. These currents are of interest in a number of industrial as well as natural
applications and so obtaining an understanding of the way in which they propagate is a
subject that has motivated a considerable amount of current research (Huppert 2006).

In previous publications, our understanding of axisymmetric viscous gravity currents
on an impermeable boundary (Huppert 1982) has been generalised to take account of
the eﬀects of a slope (Lister 1992) as well as the propagation of a current in a porous
medium (Huppert & Woods 1995; Lyle et al. 2005). Here, we consider the propagation
of a gravity current from a point source in a porous medium at an impermeable sloping
boundary. Of particular interest is the evolution of the current away from the axisym-
metric similarity solution found by Lyle et al. (2005).

We begin by deriving the evolution equations for the shape of a current whose volume
varies in time like qtα. A scaling analysis of these governing equations reveals the extent
of the current as a function of time up to a multiplicative constant. The full form of the
similarity solutions that give rise to these scalings can only be determined by numerical
means, however, and to do so we modify the numerical code of Lister (1992). For some
particular values of α, it is possible to make analytical progress; these cases are considered
separately and provide a useful check of the numerical scheme. We then compare the
results of the numerical calculations to a series of experiments and ﬁnd good quantitative
agreement between the two. Finally, in the last section, we discuss the implications of our

results in geological settings, with particular emphasis on the implications of our work
for the sequestration of carbon dioxide.

2. Formulation

2.1. Governing equations
We consider a gravity current consisting of ﬂuid material of density ρ + ∆ρ in a deep
porous medium saturated with ﬂuid of density ρ, which is bounded by an impermeable
barrier at an angle θ to the horizontal (see ﬁg. 1 for a sketch of the setup). That the
saturated porous medium is deep in comparison with the vertical extent of the current
allows us to neglect the motion of the surrounding ﬂuid, simplifying the problem consid-
erably. We use the natural Cartesian co-ordinate system centred on the mass source and
aligned with the slope of the impermeable boundary. The depth, h(x, y, t), of the gravity
current is then determined by continuity combined with Darcy’s law (see Bear 1988, for
example) and the assumption that the pressure in the current is hydrostatic, i.e.

the right hand side representing the gravity–driven spreading of the current and its
advection downslope, respectively.

It is common to close the system by requiring that the volume of the current depend
on time like qtα for some constant α
0 (Huppert 1982; Lister 1992; Huppert & Woods
1995). This constraint leads to solutions of self-similar form (as we shall see again in this
case) but also covers the natural cases of a ﬁxed volume release (α = 0) and a constant
ﬂux release (α = 1). To impose this volume constraint, (2.3) must be solved along with

2.2. Scalings

To aid our physical understanding of the spreading of the gravity current, we begin by
considering the scaling behaviour of the spreading in the limits of short and long times.
This is done by considering the possible dominant balances between the terms in (2.7)
and eliminating those that are not self-consistent. For α < 3, this analysis reveals that

≪

That we observe axisymmetric spreading if α > 3 and T

1 is surprising, but is
a consequence of the fact that the downslope ﬂux in a porous medium gravity current
is only weakly dependent on the local height and so can be swamped by the spreading
terms in (2.7). In the viscous case, this is not possible because the downslope ﬂux is
able to remove the incoming ﬂux much more eﬃciently and penalises the accumulation
of material at a particular point more.

≫

2.3. Numerics
The axisymmetric spreading of a gravity current in a porous medium above an horizontal
plane was considered by Lyle et al. (2005). In particular, they determined the coeﬃcients
in the scalings (2.9) by ﬁnding a solution dependent on one similarity variable in this
case. To determine the prefactors in the non-axisymmetric scaling relations (2.10), it
is necessary to resort to numerical solutions of (2.7) and (2.8). The numerical code
we used was adapted from that used by Lister (1992) for a viscous gravity current on
an inclined plane, with minor alterations to make it applicable to a gravity current
in a porous medium. This code is an implementation of a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme on
a rectangular grid with time-stepping performed using an alternating-direction-implicit
method. Equation (2.7) was written in ﬂux-conservative form allowing the diﬀusive and
advective terms to be represented by the Il’in scheme (Clauser & Kiesner 1987). More
details of the numerical scheme may be found in Lister (1992).

3. Special values of α

In this section, we consider separately particular values of α that are of special interest.
In some of these cases, it is possible to make progress analytically providing useful checks
on the numerical scheme discussed in
2.3, but they also shed light on situations of
practical interest.

§

3.1. Constant volume
As already noted, the diﬀerential equation in (2.7) may be simpliﬁed by moving into a
frame translating at unit speed downslope. However, for general values of α, this cor-
responds to a point source that is moving uphill in the new frame, complicating the

state shape that is found at long times in these rescaled variables. The similarity solution for the

For very long times T ≫ 1, we expect that a constant ﬂux current (corresponding to

It is interesting to note that the similarity solution (3.4) is precisely that given by Huppert & Woods

(1995) for the shape of a two-dimensional current of constant volume spreading in a
porous medium above an horizontal boundary. This correspondence arises because in the
steady state case considered here, ﬂuid moves downslope at a constant velocity — inde-
pendently of its cross-slope position and the current height — so that X is a proxy for
time. A material slice in the y–z plane thus remains planar as it is advected downslope
and so spreads laterally in exactly the same way that a ﬁxed volume release does in
two-dimensions.

3.3. α = 3

When α = 3, the non-dimensionalisation leading to (2.7) breaks down because there is no
longer a characteristic time-scale t∗ of the motion. Instead, an additional natural velocity
scale, q1/3, enters the problem. We thus deﬁne a new set of dimensionless variables
˜T = t/˜t∗, ˜H = h/˜h∗, ˜X = x/˜x∗ and ˜Y = y/˜y∗ where ˜t∗ is an arbitrary timescale and

The system (3.8) and (3.9) was solved by timestepping the problem in (3.6) and (3.7)
using a minor modiﬁcation of the code described in
2.3. This was found to be a conve-
nient method of solution and also demonstrates that time-dependent solutions converge
on the time-independent solution. The results of this calculation are shown in ﬁg. 3 for
a number of diﬀerent values of δ.

§

The importance of the case α = 3 as a transition between qualitatively diﬀerent ﬂow
regimes is reminiscent of earlier work on gravity currents. For an axisymmetric gravity
current, Huppert (1982) found that viscous forces dominate inertia at long times for α < 3
(being insigniﬁcant at short times) with the situation reversed for α > 3. Acton et al.
(2001) found that a viscous gravity current propagating over a permeable medium spreads

4. Experimental results

We conducted experiments in which a saline solution (dyed red) was injected at con-
stant ﬂux (α = 1) into the base of a porous medium saturated with fresh water. The
details of the experimental setup are as described by Lyle et al. (2005) although the
perspex tank was tilted (so that the gravity current was propagating on a slope). Addi-
tionally, the saline solution was injected at the edge of the tank, away from the corner
because the inherent symmetry is diﬀerent here to that of the axisymmetric case. Video
footage of the motion was captured using a CCD camera and measurements of the front
distance down slope xn as well as the maximum lateral extent of the current ymax were
made using the image analysis software ImageJ
. The details of the six diﬀerent values of

scales t∗, x∗ and h∗. The latter estimates are based on the measurements of φ = 0.37
and k = 6.8

The experimental results plotted in ﬁg. 5 shows that the experimental results are in
good agreement with the theoretical results produced by solving (2.7). In particular,
the scalings predicted in (2.10) are borne out by these results although the associated

that found by Lyle et al. (2005). Two possible mechanisms may account for this discrep-
ancy: mechanical dispersion of the intruding saline solution (see Brady & Koch 1988, for
example) and the fact that the pore Reynolds number in our experiments is typically
O(5). Such a value of the pore Reynolds number suggests that we may be approaching
the regime where Darcy’s law begins to break down, which is around Re = 10 (Bear
1988). Neither of these mechanisms, however, seem to account for the observation that
the downslope extent of the current, Xn is systematically below that predicted, while
the cross-slope spreading observed is more than that predicted.

5. Geological relevance

Our experimental and numerical analyses have shown that shortly after the initia-
tion of a constant ﬂux gravity current (α = 1) it begins to spread axisymmetrically in
the manner described by Lyle et al. (2005). However, at times much longer than the
characteristic time t∗ given in (2.5), the current loses its axisymmetry and propagates
predominantly downslope. Since it propagates at constant velocity in this regime, the

current propagates much further and faster in this case than would be the case if it
remained axisymmetric. This is potentially problematic in a range of practical applica-
tions, such as the sequestration of carbon dioxide in which super-critical carbon dioxide
is pumped into aquifers. Since the density of the liquid carbon dioxide lies in the range
−3 (Chadwick et al. 2005), it remains buoyant with respect to the ambient
500
water and so will rise up any inclined boundaries.

±
The time-scale, t∗, over which asymmetric spreading develops is of interest to those
wishing to predict the course of the released current. While it is diﬃcult to evaluate t∗
in a precise manner because of the uncertainties in the properties of the surrounding
rock, we can perform some estimates on the basis of the available data from the Sleipner
ﬁeld (Bickle et al. 2005; Chadwick et al. 2005). In this Norwegian ﬁeld, around 109 kg of
liquid CO2 is currently pumped into the local sandstone each year. Presumably due to
geological complications, this single input ﬂux is observed later to separate into around
ten independent currents propagating within diﬀerent horizons of the permeable layer,
each of which has a volume ﬂux lying in the region 0.002 . q . 0.03 m3s−1. Combined

(Dated: July 20, 2004)

The most elementary structures of turbulence, i.e., vortex tubes, are studied using velocity data
obtained in a laboratory experiment for boundary layers with Reynolds numbers Reλ = 295–1255.
We conduct conditional averaging for enhancements of a small-scale velocity increment and obtain
the typical velocity proﬁle for vortex tubes. Their radii are of the order of the Kolmogorov length.
Their circulation velocities are of the order of the root-mean-square velocity ﬂuctuation. We also
obtain the distribution of the interval between successive enhancements of the velocity increment as
the measure of the spatial distribution of vortex tubes. They tend to cluster together below about
the integral length and more signiﬁcantly below about the Taylor microscale. These properties are
independent of the Reynolds number and are hence expected to be universal.

INTRODUCTION

Turbulence contains vortex tubes as the most elemen-
tary structures [1, 2, 3, 4]. Regions of strong vorticity are
organized into tubes. The energy dissipation is signiﬁ-
cant around them. They occupy a small fraction of the
volume and are embedded in the background ﬂow that
is random and of large scales. Their existence has been
established at microscale Reynolds numbers Reλ <
2000,
∼
by seeding turbulent liquid with gas bubbles and thereby
visualizing regions of low pressure that is associated with
strong vorticity [5, 6, 7, 8].

ble visualization does not provide suﬃcient information
[13]. We accordingly use velocity ﬁelds of laboratory tur-
bulence at high Reynolds numbers to study some of the
tube parameters. The velocity ﬁeld is intermittent at
small scales. A small-scale velocity variation is enhanced
at the positions of vortex tubes [6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
There are several possible conﬁgurations for laboratory
experiments. Although the most popular conﬁguration
is isotropic grid turbulence, its Reynolds number is not
high [18]. We instead use rough-wall boundary-layer tur-

bulence. The highest Reynolds number achieved in our
experiment is Reλ = 1255, which exceeds those in almost
all the previous studies for vortex tubes in the velocity
ﬁeld [14].

Using a probe suspended in the ﬂow, we obtained a
one-dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld. We measured
not only the velocity component in the mean-ﬂow direc-
tion but also the component that is perpendicular to the
mean-ﬂow direction. The latter component is suited to
detecting circulation ﬂows such as those associated with
vortex tubes [15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

The experiment is described in Sec. II. We present
a model for vortex tubes in Sec. III. From the experi-
mental data, the typical velocity proﬁle for vortex tubes
is extracted and its radius and circulation velocity are
obtained in Sec. IV. The spatial distribution of vortex
tubes is obtained in Sec. V. The dependences of these
tube parameters on the Reynolds number are studied in
Sec. VI. We conclude with remarks in Sec. VII.

II. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was done in a wind tunnel of the Me-
teorological Research Institute. We use the coordinates
x, y, and z in the streamwise, spanwise, and ﬂoor-normal
directions. The corresponding wind velocities are u, v,
and w. The origin x = y = z = 0 is taken on the tun-
nel ﬂoor at the entrance to the test section. Its size was
δx = 18 m, δy = 3 m, and δz = 2 m. Over the entire
ﬂoor of the test section, we placed blocks as roughness
elements. Their size was δx = 6 cm, δy = 21 cm, and
δz = 11 cm. The spacing of the adjacent blocks was
δx = δy = 0.5 m. We set the incoming-wind velocity to
be Ui = 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 m s−1.

The streamwise and spanwise velocities were simulta-
neously measured using a hot-wire anemometer. The
anemometer was composed of a crossed-wire probe and
a constant temperature system. The wires were made of
platinum-coated tungsten, 5 µm in diameter, 1.25 mm in
eﬀective length, 1 mm in separation, 280◦C in tempera-

The calibration was done before and after each of the
measurements. We did not measure the ﬂoor-normal ve-
locity, which suﬀers from mean shear and hence is less
suited to studying vortex tubes than the spanwise veloc-
ity.

The measurement positions were at x = 12.5 m, where
the boundary layer was well developed. The 99% thick-
ness, i.e., the height at which the mean streamwise ve-
locity U is 99% of its maximum value ˆU , was 0.8 m. The

ˆz is the height for the velocity ˆU [20]. The 99% thick-
ness and displacement thickness were independent of the
incoming-wind velocity. Thus, among all the measure-
ments, the overall ﬂow structure was the same. The rea-
son is that the Reynolds number for the entire boundary
layer was high enough.

The energy spectra of the spanwise velocity are shown
in Fig. 1. We have used Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis
to convert temporal variations into spatial variations in
the streamwise direction. Throughout the energy spec-
tra, the signal-to-noise ratio is high.

The experimental conditions and ﬂow characteristics
are summarized in Table I. The microscale Reynolds
number Reλ ranges from 295 to 1255. We have ob-
tained the smallest-scale statistics from the spanwise-
velocity gradient ∂xv instead of the usual streamwise-
velocity gradient ∂xu, by assuming the smallest-scale

nent measured by a crossed-wire probe is contaminated
with the w component that is perpendicular to the plane
of the two wires of the probe [22, 23]. The v component
is free from such a contamination. For the smallest-scale
isotropy, we have no direct evidence. The smallest-scale
isotropy still serves as a meaningful assumption, even if
it was not achieved, because our present results are then
comparable with those obtained in isotropic turbulence.

III. MODEL FOR VORTEX TUBES

The representative model for vortex tubes is the Burg-
ers vortex, an axisymmetric steady circulation in a strain
ﬁeld. In cylindrical coordinates, the circulation and the
strain ﬁeld are written, respectively, as

Here ν is the kinematic viscosity. The circulation is max-
imal at R = R0 = 2.24(ν/a)1/2. Thus R0 is regarded as
the tube radius.

Suppose that the axis of the vortex tube penetrates the
(x, y) plane at the point (0, ∆). The x and y axes are,
respectively, in the streamwise and spanwise directions.
If the direction of the tube axis is (θ, ϕ) in spherical coor-
dinates, the streamwise (u) and spanwise (v) components

of the circulation ﬂow uΘ along the x axis are

and the tube is not heavily inclined (θ

our interest. The velocity proﬁles of vortex tubes with

Since there are large-scale velocity ﬂuctuations, a vor-

IV. VELOCITY PROFILE OF VORTEX TUBES

The typical proﬁles for vortex tubes in the streamwise
(u) and spanwise (v) velocities are extracted by averaging
signals centered at the position where the absolute value
of the spanwise-velocity increment
is en-
hanced above a certain threshold [16, 17, 18]. We set the
scale δx to be the sampling interval U/fs. The threshold
is set to be the highest percentile for the absolute values
of the velocity increments. Thus 1% of them are used for
the averaging. When the velocity increment is negative,
we invert the sign of the v signal before the averaging.
The results are shown in Fig. 2.

The threshold value for the enhancement of the veloc-
ity increment has been determined with a compromise.
If the threshold is higher, the statistical uncertainty is
more signiﬁcant. If the threshold is lower, the contami-
nation with the background ﬂow is more signiﬁcant. We
nevertheless expect that our following results are qual-
itatively independent of the threshold if the fraction of
the velocity increments used for the averaging is <
1%.

into the symmetric and antisymmetric components and
have shown only the antisymmetric components. The
contamination with the w component leads to a sym-
metric positive excursion in the u proﬁle [23, 25]. Such
an excursion was seen in our previous study [18, 26]. The
u proﬁle averaged for vortex tubes is antisymmetric (see
Sec. III).

To ensure the statistical signiﬁcance, we have reduced

the sample size by a factor of 2 and redone the conditional
averaging. The velocity proﬁles do not diﬀer from those
in Fig. 2 by more than a line thickness.

For reference, we show the v proﬁle (2b) of a Burgers
vortex with ∆ = 0 and θ = 0 in Fig. 2 (dotted lines).
The radius R0 and the maximum circulation velocity V0
have been determined so as to ﬁt the observed proﬁle
at around their peaks. There our conditional averaging
prefers vortex tubes with ∆
0 because such
tubes have the strongest signals. Since the Kolmogorov
length η is smaller than the probe size in the streamwise
direction l, we have assumed that the measured velocity
vm(x) is the true velocity vt(x) averaged over the probe

The observed v proﬁle is close to the proﬁle of a Burg-
ers vortex [11, 18, 19]. We thus conﬁrm the existence of
vortex tubes and their responsibility for small-scale in-
termittency at high microscale Reynolds numbers. The
observed v proﬁle has more pronounced tails than the
proﬁle of a Burgers vortex. There should be contribu-
tion from vortex tubes that are heavily inclined to the
streamwise direction with θ

The u± proﬁles are dominated by the circulation ﬂow
uΘ of vortex tubes passing the probe at some distances
∆ > 0 [Eq. (2a)] or with some incident angles φ > 0
[14]. If the radial inﬂow uR of the strain ﬁeld were pre-
dominant, we would observe u(x)
ax/2 [Eq. (4a)].
This is not the case. The u− proﬁle only has a somewhat
larger amplitude than the u+ proﬁle. Unlike a Burgers
vortex, an actual vortex tube is not always oriented to
the stretching direction [9, 10, 18, 19, 27].

V. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF VORTEX
TUBES

The spatial distribution of vortex tubes on the one-
dimensional cut of a turbulent ﬂow is studied using the
probability density P0 of the interval δx′ between suc-
cessive enhancements of the spanwise-velocity increment.
The enhancement is deﬁned with the same threshold as
in Sec. IV. We show the probability density distribution
in Fig. 4, where the interval is normalized by the Taylor
microscale λ in order to cover both the small and large
intervals. The statistical signiﬁcance is less than that of
the velocity proﬁles in Fig. 2, but it is still suﬃcient for
our analysis [28].

For intervals δx′ >
∼

5λ, we successfully model the prob-
ability density with a sum of two exponential functions
(dotted curves):

P0(δx′) = c0 exp

δx′
δx0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)−

+ c1 exp

δx′
δx1 (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)−

(6)

with δx0 < δx1. The second term implies that the proba-
bility density distribution has an exponential tail that ap-
pears linear on the semi-logarithmic plot (dotted straight
lines). This is characteristic of the Poisson process of ran-
dom and independent events [29]. Thus the large-scale
distribution of vortex tubes is random and independent.
The ﬁrst term implies that, with decreasing the interval,
the probability density becomes enhanced over that for

bution is normalized by the amplitude of its exponential tail
(dotted straight lines), and it is shifted vertically by a factor
10. The interval is normalized by the Taylor microscale λ.

the exponential distribution [6, 8, 16, 18]. Since the en-
hancement is signiﬁcant below about the spanwise inte-
gral length Lv, this is attributable to clustering of vortex
tubes below about the energy-containing scale. It was ac-
tually demonstrated in direct numerical simulations that
strong vortex tubes lie on borders of energy-containing
eddies [10]. The clustering scale δx0 is a few times the
Taylor microscale λ (Table I).

With decreasing the interval δx′ below about the scale
δx0, the probability density becomes enhanced over our
model (6). The clustering of vortex tubes becomes sig-
niﬁcant. In Table I, we show the probability density at
δx′ = λ, which has been normalized by the amplitude
of the exponential tail. The probability density at the
smaller intervals is not so useful because a very strong

the velocity increment.

VI. DEPENDENCE ON REYNOLDS NUMBER

Thus far we have obtained the parameters of vortex
tubes, i.e., the radius R0, the maximum circulation ve-
locity V0, and the interval distribution P0. Their de-
pendences on the microscale Reynolds number Reλ are
studied here. To extend the Reλ range, we also use veloc-
ity data from our previous experiment of grid turbulence
at Reλ = 105–329 [18]. These data are reanalyzed in the
same manner as for our present data. The results are
summarized in Fig. 5, where quantities are normalized
by their values at Reλ = 430.

The tube radius R0 scales with the Kolmogorov length
η over the entire range of the Reynolds number
η as R0 ∝
[Fig. 5(a)]. This is the most signiﬁcant scaling law among
those studied here.

The circulation velocity V0 scales with the root-mean-
1/2 at

square velocity ﬂuctuation
Reλ >
∼

Reλ <
400, the scaling is achieved at high Reynolds num-
∼
bers. Although the velocity ﬂuctuation is a quantity for
large scales, vortex tubes could be formed via shear insta-
bilities on borders of energy-containing eddies [6, 7, 10],
where a velocity variation over a small scale such as the
tube radius could be comparable to the velocity ﬂuctu-
ation. The circulation velocity also scales with the Kol-
mogorov velocity uK as V0 ∝
uK [Fig. 5(c)]. However, at
Reλ >
400, this scaling is less signiﬁcant than the scaling
∼
with the velocity ﬂuctuation.

The scaling laws for the radius R0 and the circulation
velocity V0 lead to the scaling law for the Reynolds num-
ber Re0 = R0V0/ν that characterizes the circulations of
vortex tubes:

Re0 ∝ Re1/2
Re0 = constant

λ

if R0 ∝ η

if R0 ∝ η

and V0 ∝ hv2i1/2,
and V0 ∝ uK .

(7a)
(7b)

These relations are from the deﬁnitions of the Reynolds
number Reλ, the Kolmogorov length η, and the Kol-
mogorov velocity uK as in Table I. The present result
favors the former scaling [Fig. 5(d)] rather than the lat-
ter [Fig. 5(e)] at least for Reλ >
400. With an increase
∼
of the Reynolds number Reλ, vortex tubes have higher
Reynolds numbers Re0 and are accordingly more unsta-
ble [10]. They would nevertheless survive long enough
to be observable as distinct entities that are responsible
for small-scale intermittency. Turbulence is known to be
more intermittent at a higher Reynolds number Reλ [2].
For general vortex tubes, we do not necessarily expect
λ . Weak
the scaling laws V0 ∝ h
vortex tubes are not considered here because our veloc-
ity proﬁles were obtained for enhancements of a velocity
increment. Actually in direct numerical simulations, the
scaling law V0 ∝
uK was obtained when vortex tubes
were identiﬁed as local minima of the pressure [4]. The
1/2 was obtained when vortex tubes
scaling law V0 ∝ h
i
were identiﬁed as enhancements of the vorticity above a
threshold [10].

The probability density P0 at the interval δx′ = λ ap-
pears to increase as the Reynolds number increases up
400 [Fig. 5(f)]. Above the Reynolds number
to Reλ ≃
400, the probability density is constant. The clus-
Reλ ≃
tering of vortex tubes appears to become signiﬁcant and
then attain an asymptotic state. There is a discontinuity
between grid turbulence at Reλ <
300 and boundary-
layer turbulence at Reλ >
∼
300. The spatial distribu-
∼
tion of vortex tubes is aﬀected by large-scale structures
of turbulence, i.e., energy-containing eddies. For large
intervals δx′
λ, the probability density distributions
collapse to single curves according to the experimental
conﬁgurations as shown in Fig. 6.

have used the velocity data to study vortex tubes, the
most elementary structures of turbulence.

We have extracted the typical v proﬁle for vortex tubes

(Fig. 2). The proﬁle is close to the velocity proﬁle of a
Burgers vortex. The radius R0 is several of the Kol-
mogorov length η. The maximum circulation velocity V0
is about a half of the root-mean-square velocity ﬂuctua-
1/2. We have also studied the probability density

distribution of the interval between vortex tubes (Fig. 4).
The probability density is enhanced below about the inte-
gral length and more signiﬁcantly below about the Taylor
microscale, reﬂecting clustering of vortex tubes.

For the ﬁrst time at high Reynolds numbers, we have

λ . The small-scale spatial distri-
∝
bution of vortex tubes is the same (Fig. 5). Since these
properties do not necessarily exist at Reλ <
400, they
are achieved asymptotically at Reλ >
∼
400. They are ex-
∼
pected to be universal among vortex tubes in turbulence
at high Reynolds numbers. To conﬁrm this expectation,
experiments at the higher Reynolds numbers are desir-
able. Those at similar Reynolds numbers but under dif-
ferent experimental conﬁgurations are also desirable.

The vortex tubes have been identiﬁed using enhance-
ments of a velocity increment above a threshold. Thus
our results are biased against weak tubes. The develop-
ment of a method to identify vortex tubes with various
strengths is desirable [19]. We nevertheless believe that
our results are useful because strong vortex tubes play an
important role in small-scale intermittency. Their role in
energy dissipation is also expected to be important.

[12] Exceptionally high Reynolds numbers up to Reλ = 429
were achieved in the direct numerical simulation of Y.
Kaneda, T. Ishihara, M. Yokokama, K. Itakura, and A.
Uno, Phys. Fluids 15, L21 (2003). The higher Reynolds
numbers were achieved by decreasing the maximum wave
number from the standard value 2/η to a nonstandard
value 1/η. However, such lowered-resolution simulations
are not suited to studying vortex tubes.

[13] Vortex tubes with radii that are comparable to the Kol-
mogorov length η do not produce suﬃciently low pressure
to be observable in bubble visualization, which is thereby
biased toward vortex tubes with the larger radii [8].

that characteristics of vortex tubes signiﬁcantly change
across Reλ ≃ 700. Although their results at Reλ <
∼ 700
are consistent with ours, no signiﬁcant change of the tube
characteristics across Reλ ≃ 700 has been found in our

[20] The 99% thickness and displacement thickness are usu-
ally deﬁned not with the maximum value ˆU of the mean
streamwise velocity but with the incoming-wind velocity
Ui. However, since our wind tunnel was not capable of
adjusting its ceiling to set the streamwise pressure gra-
dient to be zero, the mean streamwise velocities at large
heights were greater than the incoming-wind velocity. We
thereby used the maximum value of the mean streamwise
velocity obtained at ˆz = 0.90 m.

[23] The two wires individually respond to all the u, v, and
w components. Since the measured u component corre-
sponds to the average of the responses of the two wires, it
is contaminated with the w component. The contamina-
tion is measured as an increase of the streamwise velocity.
Since the measured v component corresponds to the dif-
ference of the responses, it is free from the w component.
[24] Despite the diﬀerence in the Reynolds number Reλ, the
probability density distributions of the velocity incre-
ment in Fig. 3 are nearly the same. This is because the
energy-containing scale, which is comparable to the inte-
gral length L, and the scale δx of the velocity increment
are nearly the same. The scale range for the energy cas-
cade is nearly the same.

[26] The observed positive excursion is partially attributable
to ﬂuctuation of the velocity U +u at which a vortex tube
passes the probe. Under Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis,
the velocity increment over the given small scale is more
enhanced for a faster-moving tube, which is more likely
to be incorporated in our conditional averaging [18].

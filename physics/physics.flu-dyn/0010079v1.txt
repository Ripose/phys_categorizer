Abstract

Hagen Kleinert’s early interest in particle physics quantum ﬁeld theory served him well for
his subsequent researches on statistical physics and collective phenomena. Therefore, on the
occasion of a signiﬁcant birthday, I oﬀer him this essay, in which particle physics concepts
are blended into a ﬁeld theory for macroscopic phenomena: Fluid mechanics is enhanced by
anticommuting Grassmann variables to describe vorticity, while an additional interaction for
the Grassmann variables leads to supersymmetric ﬂuid mechanics.

1 Pr´ecis of Fluid Mechanics (With No Vorticity)

Let me begin with a pr´ecis of ﬂuid mechanical equations [1]. An isentropic ﬂuid is described
by a matter density ﬁeld ρ and a velocity ﬁeld v, which satisfy a continuity equation involving
the current j = ρv:

and a force equation involving the pressure P :

˙ρ + ∇ · (ρv) = 0

˙v + v · ∇v = −

1
ρ

∇P .

(1)

(2)

(Over-dot denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to time.) For isentropic ﬁelds, the pressure P
is a function only of the density, and the right side of (2) may also be written as −∇V ′(ρ),
where V ′(ρ) is the enthalpy, P (ρ) = ρV ′(ρ) − V (ρ), and pρV ′′(ρ) = pP ′(ρ) is the sound

speed (prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to argument).

R. Jackiw

Equations (1) and (2) can be obtained by bracketing the dynamical variables ρ and v with

the Hamiltonian H(ρ, v)

H(ρ, v) = Z dr(cid:0) 1

2 ρv2 + V (ρ)(cid:1)

˙ρ = {H, ρ}
˙v = {H, v}

(3)

(4a)

(4b)

provided the nonvanishing brackets of the fundamental variables (ρ, v) are taken to be [2]

{vi(r), ρ(r′)} = ∂iδ(r − r′)
{vi(r), vj (r′)} = −

ωij(r)
ρ(r)

δ(r − r′) .

(5a)

(5b)

(The ﬁelds in the brackets are at equal times, hence the time argument is suppressed.) Here
ωij is the vorticity, deﬁned as the curl of vi:

ωij = ∂ivj − ∂jvi .

(6)

One naturally asks whether there is a canonical 1-form that leads to the symplectic struc-
ture (5); that is, one seeks a Lagrangian whose canonical variables can be used to derive (5)
from canonical brackets. When the velocity is irrotational, the vorticity vanishes, v can be
written as the gradient of a velocity potential θ, v = ∇θ, and (5) is satisﬁed by postulating
that

{θ(r), ρ(r′)} = δ(r − r′)

(7)

that is, the velocity potential is conjugate to the density, so that the Lagrangian can be taken
as

where H is given by (3) with v = ∇θ.

L(cid:12)(cid:12)irrotational = Z dr θ ˙ρ − H(cid:12)(cid:12)v=∇θ

(8)

2 Extending the Formalism to Include Vorticity

The traditional method of including vorticity in a Lagrangian formalism [3] involves writing
the velocity in a more elaborate potential representation, the so-called Clebsch parameteriza-
tion [4],

v = ∇θ + α∇β

(9)

Description of Vorticity by Grassmann Variables and an Extension to Supersymmetry

3

which supports nonvanishing vorticity

The Lagrangian

ωij = ∂iα ∂jβ − ∂jα ∂iβ .

L = −Z dr ρ( ˙θ + α ˙β) − H(cid:12)(cid:12)v=∇θ+α∇β

(10)

(11)

identiﬁes canonical pairs to be {θ, ρ} (as in the irrotational case) and also {β, αρ}. It then
follows that the algebra (5) is satisﬁed, provided v is given by (9). The quantities (α, β) are
called the “Gauss potentials”.

The situation here is similar to the electromagnetic force law: The Lorentz equation can
be presented in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths, but a Lagrangian for the
motion requires describing the ﬁelds in terms of potentials.

3 Some Further Observations on the

Clebsch Decomposition of the Vector Field v

In three dimensions, (9) involves the same number of functions on the left and right sides of
the equality: three. The total number of dynamical variables (ρ, v) is even – four – so an
appropriate phase space can be constructed from the four potentials (ρ, θ, α, β). Nevertheless
the Gauss potentials are not uniquely determined by v. The following is the reason why
a canonical formulation of (5) requires using the Clebsch decomposition (9). Although the
algebra (5) is consistent in that the Jacobi identity is satisﬁed, it is degenerate in that the
kinematic helicity h

h ≡ 1

2 Z d3r v · (∇ × v) = 1

2 Z d3r v · ω

(12)

(ωi = 1
2 εijkωjk) has vanishing bracket with ρ and v. (Note that h is just the Abelian Chern-
Simons term of v [5].) Consequently, a canonical formulation requires eliminating the kernel
of the algebra, that is, neutralizing h. This is achieved by the Clebsch decomposition: v =
∇θ + α∇β, ω = ∇α × ∇β, v · ω = ∇θ · (∇α × ∇β) = ∇ · (θ∇α × ∇β). Thus in the
Clebsch parameterization the helicity is given by a surface integral h = 1
2 R dS ·θ(∇α × ∇β)
– it possesses no bulk contribution, and the obstruction to a canonical realization of (5) is
removed [6].

In two spatial dimensions, the Clebsch parameterization is redundant, involving three func-
tions to express the two velocity components. Moreover, the kernel of (5) in two dimensions
comprises an inﬁnite number of quantities

kn = Z d2r ρ(cid:16) ω
ρ(cid:17)n

(13)

4

R. Jackiw

for which the Clebsch parameterization oﬀers no simpliﬁcation. (Here ω is the two-dimensional
vorticity ωij = εijω.) Nevertheless, a canonical formulation in two dimensions also uses Clebsch
variables to obtain an even-dimensional phase space.

4 Kinematical Grassmann Variables for Vorticity

Rather than using the Gauss potentials (α, β) of the Clebsch parameterization (9) in the de-
scription of vorticity (10), we propose an alternative that makes use of Grassmann variables [7].
We write

v = ∇θ − 1

2 ψa∇ψa

(14)

where ψa is a multicomponent, real Grassmann spinor ψ∗
of components depends on spatial dimensionality.) Evidently the nonvanishing vorticity is

a = ψa, (ψaψb)∗ = ψ∗

aψ∗

b . (The number

Moreover, the canonical 1-form in the Lagrangian that replaces (11) reads

ωij = −∂iψa ∂jψa .

L = −Z dr ρ( ˙θ − 1

2 ψa ˙ψa) − H(cid:12)(cid:12)v=∇θ− 1

2 ψ∇ψ

(15)

(16)

The Hamiltonian retains its (bosonic) form (3), but the Grassmann variables are hidden in the
formula for the velocity. From the canonical 1-form, we deduce that (θ, ρ) remain a conjugate
pair [see (7)] and that the canonically independent Grassmann variables are √ρ ψ. Thus we
postulate, in addition to the Poisson bracket (7) satisﬁed by (θ, ρ), a Poisson antibracket for
the Grassmann variables

{ψa(r), ψb(r′)} = −

δab
ρ(r)

δ(r − r′)

and this, together with (7), has the further consequence that the following brackets hold:

1

{θ(r), ψ(r′)} = −
{v(r), ψ(r′)} = −

2ρ(r)
∇ψ(r)

ρ(r)

δ(r − r′)
δ(r − r′) .

(17)

(18)

(19)

The algebra (5) follows.

One may state that it is natural to describe vorticity by Grassmann variables: vortex
motion is associated with spin, and the Grassmann description of spin within classical physics
is well known.
In the model as developed thus far the Grassmann variables have no role
beyond the kinematical one of parameterizing vorticity (15) and providing the correct bracket
structure. They do not contribute to the equations of motion for ρ and v, (1) and (2) [even
though they are hidden in the formula (14) for v]. Moreover, they satisfy a free equation:
from (16) it follows that

˙ψ + v · ∇ψ = 0 .

5 Dynamical Grassmann Variables for

Supersymmetry

Thus far the Grassmann variables’ only role has been to parameterize the velocity/vorticity
(14), (15) and to provide canonical variables for the symplectic structure (5). The equations
for the ﬂuid (1), (2) are not polluted by them and they do not appear in the Hamiltonian,
beyond their hidden contribution to v. Thus the equation for the Grassmann ﬁelds is free (20).
But now we enquire whether we can add a Grassmann term to the Hamiltonian so that

the Grassmann variables enter the dynamics and the entire model enjoys supersymmetry.

We have succeeded for a speciﬁc form of the potential V (ρ):

and for the speciﬁc dimensionalities of space-time: (2+1) and (1+1). The reason for these
speciﬁcities will be explained in the next Section.

V (ρ) =

λ
ρ

(21)

The potential (21), with λ > 0, leads to negative pressure
P (ρ) = ρV ′(ρ) − V (ρ) = −2λ/ρ

and sound speed

(hence λ > 0). This model is called the “Chaplygin gas”.

s = pP ′(ρ) = √2λ/ρ

(22)

(23)

Chaplygin introduced his equation of state as a mathematical approximation to the physi-
cally relevant adiabatic expressions V (ρ) ∝ ρn with n > 0 [8]. (Constants are arranged so that
the Chaplygin formula is tangent at one point to the adiabatic proﬁle.) Also it was realized
that certain deformable solids can be described by the Chaplygin equation of state [9]. These
days negative pressure is recognized as a possible physical eﬀect: exchange forces in atoms
give rise to negative pressure; stripe states in the quantum Hall eﬀect may be a consequence
of negative pressure; the recently discovered cosmological constant may be exerting negative
pressure on the cosmos, thereby accelerating expansion.

5.1 Planar model

In (2+1) dimensions the Grassmann variables possess 2-components and two real 2 × 2 Dirac
“α”-matrices act on them: α1 = σ1, α2 = σ3. The supersymmetric Hamiltonian is

H = Z d2rn 1
where it is understood that v = ∇θ − 1
form (1), the force equation acquires a contribution from the Grassmann variables

(26)

These equations of motion, together with (1), ensure that the following supercharges are time
independent:

Q = Z d2r(cid:8)ρv · (αψ) + √2λψ(cid:9)
˜Q = Z d2r ρψ .

They generate the following transformations:

˜δψ = −η
˜δv = 0

where η is a two-component constant Grassmann spinor. The antibrackets of the supercharges
produce other conserved quantities:

{Qa, Qb} = −2δabH
{ ˜Qa, ˜Qb} = −δabN
{ ˜Qa, Qb} = αab · P + √2λδabΩ .

(29a)

(29b)

(29c)

Here N is the conserved number R d2r ρ, P is the conserved momentum R d2r ρv, and Ω is a
center given by the volume of space R d2r.
5.2 Lineal model

In (1+1) dimensions the Chaplygin gas equation can be written in compact form in terms of
the Riemann coordinates

Both eqs. (1) and (2) are equivalent to

√2λ/ρ .

(31)

It is known that this system is completely integrable [11]. One hint for this is the existence of
an inﬁnite number of constants of motion:

I n

are time-independent by virtue of (31).

The supersymmetric Hamiltonian makes use of a real, 1-component Grassmann ﬁeld ψ [12]:

(33)

H = Z dx(cid:16) 1

The velocity is given by v = ∂
∂x ψ and the equations of motion for the bosonic variables
retain the same form as the absence of ψ, that is, (1), (2) continue to hold. The Grassmann
ﬁeld satisﬁes

˙ψ + R−

∂
∂x

ψ = 0

(34)

and a general solution follows immediately with the help of (31): ψ is an arbitrary function
of R+.

ψ = Ψ(R+)

(35)

Thus the system remains completely integrable.

The supersymmetry charges and transformation laws are obvious dimensional reductions

of (27)–(28):

Q = Z dx ρR+ψ
˜Q = Z dx ρψ

∂
∂x

(ρψ)

δρ = −η
δψ = −ηψψ′ − ηR+
δv = −η(ψv)′ + ηR+ψ′

˜δρ = 0
˜δψ = −η
˜δv = 0 .

The algebra of these is

{Q, Q} = −2H
{ ˜Q, ˜Q} = −N
{ ˜Q, Q} = P + √2λΩ .

(36a)

(36b)

In view of (35), we see that evaluating the supercharges Q and ˜Q on the solution gives

expressions of the same form as the bosonic conserved charges (33).

Indeed, we recognize that two charges in (36) are the ﬁrst two in an inﬁnite tower of con-
served supercharges, which generalizes the inﬁnite number of bosonic conserved quantities (32):

Qn = Z dx ρRn

6 The Origins of Our Models

We have succeeded in supersymmetrizing a speciﬁc model – the Chaplygin gas – in speciﬁc
dimensionalities – the 2-dimensional plane and the 1-dimensional line – leading to nonrelativis-
tic, supersymmetric ﬂuid mechanics in (2+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional space-time. The reason
for these speciﬁcities is that both models descend from Nambu-Goto models for extended sys-
tems in a target space of one dimension higher than the world volume of the extended object.
Speciﬁcally, a membrane in three spatial dimensions and a string in two spatial dimensions,
when gauge-ﬁxed in a light-cone gauge, can be shown to devolve to a bosonic Chaplygin gas
in two and one spatial dimensions, respectively [13]. The ﬂuid velocity potential arises from
the single dynamical variable in the gauge-ﬁxed Nambu-Goto theory, namely, the transverse
direction variable for the membrane in space and the string on a plane. Although purely
bosonic Chaplygin gas models in other dimensions can devolve from appropriate Nambu-Goto
models for extended objects, for the supersymmetric case we need a superextended object, and
these exist only in speciﬁc dimensionalities. In our case it is the light-cone parameterized su-
permembrane in (3+1)-dimensional space-time [14] and the superstring in (2+1)-dimensional
space-time [15] that give rise to our planar and lineal supersymmetric ﬂuid models.

One naturally wonders whether an arbitrary bosonic potential V (ρ) has a supersymmetric
partner in arbitrary dimensions, and this problem is under further investigation. One promising
approach is to consider parameterizations of extended objects other than the light-cone one.
It is known that in the purely bosonic case, other parameterizations of the Nambu-Goto
actions lead to other ﬂuid mechanical models, and this should carry over to a supersymmetric
generalization.

Incidentally, the existence of Nambu-Goto antecedents of the ﬂuid models that we have
discussed allows one to understand some of their remarkable properties: complete integrability
in the lineal case; existence of further symmetries (which we have not discussed here) and
relation to other models (which devolve from the same extended system, but are parameterized
diﬀerently from the light-cone method) [16].

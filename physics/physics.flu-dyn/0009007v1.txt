A new mechanism of the collapse in hydrodynamics is
suggested, due to breaking of continuously distributed vor-
tex lines. Collapse results in formation of the point singu-
larities of the vorticity ﬁeld |Ω|. At the collapse point, the
value of the vorticity blows up as (t0 − t)−1 where t0 is a
collapse time. The spatial structure of the collapsing distri-
bution approaches a pancake form: contraction occurs by the
law l1 ∼ (t0− t)3/2 along the ”soft” direction, the characteris-
tic scales vanish like l2 ∼ (t0 − t)1/2 along two other (”hard”)
directions. This scenario of the collapse is shown to take place
in the integrable three-dimensional hydrodynamics with the

Hamiltonian H = R |Ω|dr. Most numerical studies of col-

lapse in the Euler equation are in a good agreement with the
proposed theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

Collapse in hydrodynamics of an ideal incompressible ﬂuid,
as a process of singularity formation in a ﬁnite time, is one
of the central problems in the theory of developed hydrody-
namic turbulence. The classical examples of such type spec-
tra are the Phillips spectrum for water-wind waves [2] and the
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum for acoustic turbulence [3].
In the ﬁrst case white caps – wages of water surface – play a
role of singularities, and in the second case these are density
breaks (or shocks).

The question about collapse in hydrodynamics is an old
problem. For example, in 1981 P.Saﬀman [4] considered col-
lapse as one of the most important problems in hydrodynam-
ics (see also papers [6] and references therein), probably al-
ready L.Richardson and A.N.Kolmogorov understood an im-
portance of this problem.
In spite of so long a history of
the question, there is no deep understanding of the nature
of a collapse in hydrodynamics, even though there are many
numerical simulations testifying to the collapse existence col-
lected by now. As far as theory is concerned, essential results
are absent, and, moreover, there is no common agreement
about collapse as a subject for incompressible hydrodynamics
(see, e.g., Sec. 7.8 of the book of U.Frisch [5] and references
therein). In the theory, the only appreciable exclusion is the
work of V.E.Zakharov, 1988 [7] (more detailed publication has
appeared in 1999 [8]), where the consistent theory of collapse
for two anti-parallel vortex ﬁlaments of small thickness was
developed in quasi-two-dimensional approximation, when a
ﬂow is almost two-dimensional with a slow dependence with
respect to the third coordinate (see also the paper [9]). A
signiﬁcant progress in studying hydrodynamic collapse has
been achieved in numerical simulations of the Euler equation.
Many numerical experiments testify that the value of the vor-
ticity |Ω| becomes inﬁnite in isolated points in a ﬁnite time.
As follows from the papers of Kerr [10], Grauer, Marliani

and Germashewsky [11], Pelz [12], Boratav and Pelz [13], |Ω|
grows at the collapse point like (t0−t)−1, where t0 is a collapse
time. According to [10], [13], a spatial scale of the collaps-
ing distribution contracts as (t0 − t)1/2. In the recent paper
by Kerr [17], an anisotropy of the collapsing region has been
reported. The data processing gave two scales, one of them
being contracted as the root l1 ∼ (t0 − t)1/2, and another one
as l2 ∼ t0 − t. It should be noted that the initial ﬂow either
possessed a deﬁnite symmetry or it was close to a symmetric
ﬂow in most numerical simulations. As a result, several sin-
gularities arose simultaneously. For example, the evolution of
two anti-parallel vortex tubes was studied in [10]. The col-
lapse here is caused by the Crow instability [14] leading at the
nonlinear stage to the vortex reconnection. Symmetry of the
ﬂow makes the collapse to happen in two symmetric points.
In the present paper, we suggest a new mechanism of the
singularity formation connected with breaking of continuously
distributed vortex lines. This mechanism is not related to any
symmetry of the initial vorticity. The collapse itself is possible
in one separate point. Probably, just this type of collapse has
been observed in the recent numerical experiment [15].

The mechanism suggested can be naturally incorporated
into the classical catastrophe theory [16]. From this point
of view, collapse can be considered as caustic formation for a
solenoidal ﬁeld. It is not so easy to understand, how a collapse
arises in the Eulerian description. First, this is connected with
a hidden symmetry of the Euler equation, i.e., the relabeling
symmetry (for more details see the reviews [18], [19]). This
symmetry generates the conservation law for the Lagrangian
invariant – the so-called Cauchy invariant, which is expressed
through the velocity curl and the Jacoby matrix of a map-
ping from the Eulerian variables to the Lagrangian ones, and
by this reason this invariant occurs very nonlocal in terms of
the velocity ﬁeld. On the one hand, the Cauchy invariant is
known as invariant which characterizes the property of frozen-
ness of vortex lines into a ﬂuid. On the other hand, all known
conservation laws for vorticity, such as the Kelvin’s and Er-
tel’s theorems, conservation of the topological Hopf invariant,
being a measure of the ﬂow knottiness, are a simple conse-
quence of the Cauchy invariant constancy. The frozenness of
vortex lines means that ﬂuid particles are pasted to a given
vortex line and never leave it. A destruction of frozenness
is possible only due to viscosity, i.e., beyond ideal hydrody-
namics. Therefore, as a next natural step in the vortex mo-
tion description, a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description has
been introduced, where the main object is a vortex line [20],
[21]. Each vortex line in this description is labeled by a two-
dimensional Lagrangian marker, while the third coordinate
serves as a parameter determining the curve. This represen-
tation, which we called as the vortex line representation, is a
key-point in the description of hydrodynamic collapse which
can be considered as a process of a caustic formation for the
solenoidal vorticity ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows:

in Sec.II we introduce

1

the vortex line representation and explain its meaning.
In
Sec.III we consider the 3D integrable hydrodynamic model
introduced in our previous paper [20]. The Hamiltonian of
this model is unusual, it is expressed through the absolute
value of the vorticity |Ω|

H = Z |Ω|dr.

(1.1)

The given model can be integrated by means of combina-
tion of the vortex line representation and the inverse scat-
tering transform. By applying the vortex line representa-
tion, the Hamiltonian is decomposed into a sum of Hamiltoni-
ans of non-interacting vortex lines. Dynamics of each vortex
line is described by the integrable one-dimensional Landau-
Lifshitz equation for a Heisenberg ferromagnet or by its gauge-
equivalent - the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Thus, the
integrable hydrodynamics represents a hydrodynamics of free
vortex lines. As for hydrodynamics of free particles – hy-
drodynamics of dust with a null pressure (see, e.g. [22]), for
the 3D integrable hydrodynamics typical singularities are also
caustics. For hydrodynamics of dust, density turns into inﬁn-
ity at caustics. Unlike the dust density, being a scalar charac-
teristics, vorticity is a vector solinoidal ﬁeld. Therefore, the
latter imposes some restrictions on a spatial structure near
singularity. As it is shown in Sec.IV, the singularity struc-
ture, being very anisotropic, turns into a pancake form. The
spatial collapsing distribution at t → t0 leads to quasi-two-
dimensional. Along the ”soft” direction a more rapid com-
pression takes place as l1 ∼ (t0 − t)3/2, and along two other–
”hard” – directions l2 ∼ (t0 − t)1/2. At the collapse time,
the vorticity vector lies in the pancake plane and its value
|Ω| blows up like (t0 − t)−1. This behavior corresponds to
the general situation. The degenerated case is considered in
Sect. V, where we consider collapse for topologically nontriv-
ial axi-symmetric distribution of vorticity in the form of the
so-called Hopf mapping when any two vortex lines are linked
once with each other. In this case two eigen-values of the Ja-
cobi matrix vanish simultaneously in the collapse point. As
its sequence, vorticity occurs to have more strong singularity:
|Ω| ∼ (t0 − t)−2. And we conclude in Sec. VI with discussion
of numerical experiments on collapse observation in the Euler
equation and their correspondence to the proposed theory.

II. VORTEX LINES REPRESENTATION OF

HYDRODYNAMICS

Let us consider the equations of the hydrodynamic type

∂Ω
∂t

= curlhcurl

δH
δΩ × Ωi ,

(2.1)

where H{Ω} is the Hamiltonian of a system, Ω(r, t) =
curl p(r, t) is the generalized vorticity, p is the canonical mo-
mentum. The vector ﬁeld

v = curl(δH/δΩ)

(2.2)

is nothing else but the ﬂuid velocity. By the deﬁnition
div v = 0, i.e., we deal with an incompressible ﬂuid. If the

Hamiltonian coincides with the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid

H = Z p2

2

dr = Z Z Ω(r1) · Ω(r2)
8π|r1 − r2|

dr1dr2

then the expression (2.2) yields the usual relation Ω = curl v
between velocity v and vorticity Ω, while Eq.(2.1) transforms
into the Euler equation for vorticity

∂Ω
∂t

= curl[v × Ω],

div v = 0.

The important property of the equation (2.1) is the frozenness
of vorticity into the substance, i.e. all Lagrangian ﬂuid par-
ticles at t > 0 remain at their own vortex line. After that, it
is natural to introduce a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian descrip-
tion when each vortex line is labeled by its own Lagrangian
marker ν, which lies in a ﬁxed two-dimensional manifold N ,
while a parameter s along the line has a meaning of an Eu-
lerian variable. In such vortex line representation vorticity is
expressed as follows [20]

Ω(r, t) = ZN

Ω0(ν)d2νZ δ(r − R(s, ν, t))

∂R
∂s

ds.

(2.3)

Here, the closed curve r = R(s, ν, t) corresponds to each vor-
tex line ν, so that Rs is its tangent vector. The quantity
Ω0(ν), with Rs being its tangent vector. The ﬁxed function
Ω0(ν) is the strength of vortex loop. However, without loss of
generality, this function can be put equal to the unity. This
can be achieved by both an appropriate re-deﬁnition of labels
ν and changing the vortex orientation to the opposite one for
those lines from the manifold N , for which Ω0(ν) < 0. There-
fore, in the next section we will omit the multiplier Ω0(ν) in
front of d2ν in the corresponding formulae.

The generalization of Eq.

(2.3) to the case of arbitrary

topology of the vortex lines is served by the formula:

Ω(r, t) = Z δ(r − R(a, t))(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)d3a,

(2.4)

where Ω0(a) is the Cauchy invariant, characterizing the
frozenness property. The diva Ω0(a) = 0 condition guar-
antees automatically incompressibility for the ﬁeld Ω(r, t):
div Ω(r) = 0. In the expression (2.4), the vector

b = (Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)

is a tangent vector to the vortex line at the point

r = R(a, t).

(2.5)

In the representation (2.3), an arc-length of line of the initial
ﬁeld Ω0(a) can serve as the parameter s.

After integrating (2.4) over a-variables, the vector Ω(r, t)
is expressed through the Jacobian J of the mapping (2.5)
J = det||∂R/∂a|| and the Cauchy invariant Ω0(a):

Ω(R) =

1
J

(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a).

(2.6)

It is important to emphasize, that in this expression the Ja-
cobian is not to be equal to the unity: J 6= 1. Nevertheless, it
does not contradict to the incompressibility condition for the
ﬂuid.

2

As it was shown in [20,21], the equations of motion for
vortex lines can be obtained directly from the equation of
frozenness (2.1)

model was introduced in our previous paper [20]. The Hamil-
tonian of this model is expressed through the absolute value
of Ω(r, t)

[{(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)} × {Rt(a, t) − v(R(a, t), t)}] = 0. (2.7)
This equation describes the transverse dynamics of vortex
line: obviously any motion along a curve leaves the curve un-
changed. In particular, this helps to understand why there are
no restrictions imposed on the value of the Jacobian J. Let
us recall that in a purely Lagrangian description of an incom-
pressible ﬂuid Jacobian is equal to the unity identically. But
accordingly to the equation (2.7), the motion of Lagrangian
particles along vortex lines is excluded from the mapping (2.5)
for the mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description. It is exactly
the reason why the Jacobian is not necessarily equal to unity
now. This point is principal and will be instrumental below
in explaining how collapse is possible in the hydrodynamic
systems (2.1).

As it was shown in [20,21], Eq.(2.7) can be written in the

Hamiltonian form

[{(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)} × Rt(a)] =

δH{Ω{R}}

δR(a)

.

(2.8)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Ω0

This equation describes a motion of vortex lines in systems
with an arbitrary Hamiltonian that depends on R through
the Ω(r, t) only.

It is useful also to keep in mind that the expressions for
such important characteristics of the system as its momentum

P = R p dr and angular momentum M = R [r × p]dr, being

transformed by integration by parts to a form, where, instead
of p, the vorticity Ω is employed, and being then rewritten in
terms of vortex lines, have the form

P ∼

1

2 Z [r × Ω]dr = ZN

d2ν

1

2 Z [R × Rs]ds

(2.9)

M ∼

1

3 Z [r × [r × Ω]]dr = ZN

d2ν

1

3 Z [R × [R × Rs]]ds

(2.10)

The ∼-sign in these relations means that equalities take place
up to integrals over surface with inﬁnitely large radius. Hence
one can see that the momentum and the angular momentum
are composed of momenta and angular momenta of each vor-
tex line, the momentum of a closed line being equal to the
oriented area of a surface tightened on the vortex loop.

It is easily to verify that uniform shift R0 of R does not
change the momentum, while the angular momentum is sub-
jected to the well known transformation
M → M′ = [R0 × P] + M.

(2.11)

III. INTEGRABLE HYDRODYNAMICS

In this and two next sections, we will show how and why
collapse is possible in 3D integrable hydrodynamics. This

H = Z |Ω(r)|dr,

(3.1)

and the equation of motion coincides with the frozenness
equation (2.1) with velocity

v = curl ~τ

where ~τ = (Ω/Ω) is the unit tangent vector along the vortex
line. Assuming all the lines closed, choosing the labeling by
such a way so that Ω0(ν) = 1, and substituting the represen-
tation (2.3) into (3.1), it is easy to see that the Hamiltonian
is decomposed as a sum of Hamiltonians for the vortex lines
1:

H{R} = Z d2νZ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂R

∂s (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ds.

(3.2)

Here, the integral over s is the length of the vortex line with
the index ν. The equation of motion for the vector R(ν, s),
in accordance with the Eq. (2.8), is local in these variables –
it doesn’t contain an interaction with other vortices:

[Rs × Rt] = [~τ × [~τ × ~τs]].

(3.3)

By this reason, not only the total energy, momentum, and
angular momentum are conserved, but also the corresponding
geometrical invariants for each vortex loop: its length

H(ν) = Z |Rs(ν)|ds,

the oriented area spanned on the vortex loop which coincides
with its momentumits momentum

P(ν) =

1

2 Z [R(ν) × Rs(ν)]ds,

and its angular momentum

M(ν) =

1

3 Z [R(ν) × [R(ν) × Rs(ν)]]ds.

It is important to pay attention to the following fact: The
equation (3.3) is invariant with respect to changes s → ˜s(s, t).
Therefore, it can be solved for Rt up to a shift along the vortex
line – the transformation leaves the vorticity Ω unchanged.
This means that to ﬁnd the vorticity Ω it is enough to have
one solution of the equation

|Rs|Rt = [~τ × ~τs] + βRs

(3.4)

which follows from Eq.(3.3) for some choice β. This leads
to an equation for ~τ as a function of the ﬁlament length l

1It is worth to notice that this property is common
for all systems with the Hamiltonians of the type H =
R F (τ, (τ∇)τ, (τ∇)2τ, . . .)|Ω|dr. To explain the idea of col-
lapse of vortex lines, we have chosen the simplest example
(3.1), which has a physical meaning.

(dl = |Rs|ds) and time t (by choosing a new value β = 0),
which reduces to the integrable one-dimensional (1D) Landau-
Lifshits equation for a Heisenberg ferromagnet

A constant value of the velocity V in this expression implies
constancy of the curvature κ, i.e. the vortex line must be a
ring of radius r = 1/κ and

∂~τ
∂t

= (cid:20)~τ ×

∂2~τ

∂l2 (cid:21) .

(3.5)

This equation, in its turn, is gauge equivalent to the 1D non-
linear Shr¨odinger equation [23]

iψt + ψll + (1/2)|ψ|2ψ = 0

(3.6)

and, for instance, can be reduced to the NLSE by means of
the Hasimoto transformation [24]

ψ(l, t) = κ(l, t) · exp(cid:20)iZ l

χ(˜l, t)d˜l(cid:21) ,

where κ(l, t) is a curvature and χ(l, t) the line torsion.

The system under consideration has direct relation to hy-
drodynamics. As it is known [25], [26], the local induction
approximation for a thin vortex ﬁlament, under assumption
of smallness of the ﬁlament width to the characteristic longi-
tudinal scale, leads to the Hamiltonian (3.2), but only for a
single separate line. The essence of this approximation is in in
replacing the logarithmic interaction law by a delta-functional
one. When the widths of the ﬁlaments are small comparable
with distances between them, in the same approximation, the
Hamiltonian of vortex lines transforms into the sum of the
Hamiltonians of independent vortex loops, yielding in a ”con-
tinuous” limit the Hamiltonian (3.1).

By such a way, we have the model of 3D integrable hydro-
dynamics of free vortex ﬁlaments. In this model, each vortex
is a nonlinear object with its own internal dynamics. As we
will see later, already in the framework of this model, a singu-
larity formation is possible. Singularities appear in this model
as a result of intersection of vortex lines that is analogous to
the phenomenon of wave breaking in gas-dynamics.

A. Stationary vortices

Let us consider now the simplest solution of Eq.(3.3), i.e.,
a stationary propagation of a closed vortex line: Rt = V ≡
const. In this case the velocity V is determined from solution
of the equation

V = 1/r.

(3.11)

The direction of the ring motion is perpendicular to its plane.
It is interesting to note that the exact answer to the velocity of
a thin (with width d ≪ r) vortex ring in ideal hydrodynamics
( [27]) coincides with Eq.(3.10) up to the logarithmic accu-
racy that just diﬀers the considering model from the Euler
equation.

Stationary solutions (3.10) in the form of rings are remark-
able within this model, because they are stable, moreover,
they are stable in the Lyapunov’ sense. Remind, that momen-
tum P of a closed vortex line is its oriented surface spanned
on the loop:

P = Sn,

where S is the surface value, n its normal. Inasmuch as the
Hamiltonian of a vortex loop coincides with its length, a max-
imum of the momentum, or, that is the same as a maximum
of surface S is obviously attained, for ﬁxed length, at the per-
fect circle. Just this proves stability of the vortex ring solution
(3.10) in the Lyapunov sense.

IV. COLLAPSE

The solution (3.10), (3.11) enables us to construct the sim-

plest mappings R = R(ν, s, t).

Let all vortex lines be circle-shaped and oriented in the
same direction, for instance, along z-axis. We will see fur-
ther that collapse in our model is a purely local phenomenon.
Therefore, it is suﬃcient to consider some vortex tube (which
can be imagined as a torus) to ﬁnd a mapping. Let vortex
rings be distributed continuously inside the tube. We label
each vortex line by the two-dimensional parameter ν, which
values coincide with coordinate of some cross section of the
tube at t = 0. We will use the ring arc-length as longitudinal
parameter s (ds = rdφ, where φ is the polar angle around
z-axis). Then, with the help of (3.10), the desired mapping
can be written as follows

R = R0(ν) + r(ν)cos φ ex + r(ν)sin φ ey + V (ν)t ez.

(4.1)

(3.7)

In this formula ex,y,z are unit vectors along the corresponding
axes.

[Rs × V] = [~τ × [~τ × ~τs]].

It is easily to check that this equation follows from the vari-
ational principle

δ(H(ν) − V · P(ν)) = 0,

(3.8)

i.e., any solution of (3.7) represents a stationary point of the
Hamiltonian for a ﬁxed momentum P(ν). The equation (3.7)
can be simply integrated, being rewritten in terms of the bi-
normal b and the curvature κ of the line as follows

that gives

[τ × V] = κ[τ × b],

V = κb.

(3.9)

(3.10)

4

It can be easily veriﬁed for this mapping that the Jacobian

is a linear function of time

J =

∂(X, Y, Z)
∂(ν1, ν2, s))

= J0(ν, s) + A(ν, s)t.

(4.2)

Here A(ν, s) is a coeﬃcient linearly dependent on the veloc-
ity derivatives with respect to ν and J0 the initial value of
Jacobian.

Dependence J (4.2) on time means that for every ﬁxed pair
ν and s there exists such a moment of time t = ˜t(ν, s) ( t > 0,
or t < 0), when Jacobian is equal to zero: J(ν, s, t) = 0.
Denote as t0 the minimal value of t = ˜t(ν, s) at t > 0. And
let this minimum be attained at some point a = a0 (here we

denote a point (ν1, ν2, s) as a). It is evident that at t = t0

(cid:0)∂˜t/∂a(cid:1) |a=a0 = 0 or

∇aJ(a, t)|a=a0

since

∇aJ(a, t)|a=a0

+

∂J(a, t)

∂t

= 0,

(4.3)

= 0.

∂˜t

∂a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=a0

It is clear also that at t = t0 the tensor of second derivatives
of J against a,

2γij =

,

∂2J

∂ai∂aj

will be positive deﬁnite at the point a = a0. Hence, it is easy
to deﬁne a behavior of the Jacobian in a small vicinity of
a = a0. Expansion of J near this point (in a typical situation)
at t → t0 is as follows

J(a, t) = α(t0 − t) + γij∆ai∆aj + ...,

(4.4)

where

α = −

∂J(a, t)

∂t

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=t0,a=a0

> 0, ∆a = a − a0.

Those are the leading contributions to the Jacobian expansion
2.

Geometrically, the above expansion corresponds to a suﬃ-
ciently simple picture. The (hyper-) surface J = J(a, t) de-
forms with time in such a manner, that its minimum reaches
the (hyper-) plane J = 0 at t = t0, where two surfaces touch
each other. Obviously, for smooth mappings in a typical case,
this touching takes place in one separate point. In a degener-
ated situation, touching is possible in a few points simultane-
ously, or even at a curve. A case, when two eigenvalues of the
Jacoby matrix ˆJ tend to zero simultaneously at the collapse
point, will be regarded also as degenerated (such an exam-
ple will be considered in the next section). In that case one
should keep the next terms in the Jacobian expansion along
the corresponding directions. We would like to repeat that
all these cases can not be considered as typical ones.

In accordance with Eq. (2.6), the equality J = 0 at the
singular point means the formation of a singularity for the
vorticity at the moment t = t0:

Ω(r, t) =

Ω0(ν)Rs

α(t0 − t) + γij∆ai∆aj

.

(4.5)

It is important, that the numerator in this fraction – the
tangent vector of a vortex line – does not vanish at the point
a0 due to its geometrical meaning. Therefore, the vorticity at
the singular point blows up as (t0−t)−1, and the characteristic
size of the collapsing distribution in a-coordinates decreases
as √t0 − t.

The above type of collapse arises as a result of vortex line
breaking when one vortex overtakes another. For ﬂows of the

2 For instance, the term containing mixed time-space deriva-
tives, in the general case, is a small correction to the ﬁrst term
in (4.4).

general type (without symmetries) a singularity must arise at
the ﬁrst time always in one separate point.

As we will see further, for the given type of collapse, the
dependence (4.5) for Ω(r, t), derived for the particular initial
distribution, is actually the general answer, which can be ap-
plied not only to the integrable hydrodynamics but also to
the whole family (2.1) of hydrodynamic systems, of course,
under the condition that they admit such (quasi-) inertial
regime of collapse. What necessary conditions should satisfy
the Hamiltonian of some particular system, in order to ex-
hibit such regime? Now the answer to this question has been
unknown that provides a wide ﬁeld for future investigations,
both theoretical and numerical.

A. Non-stationary vortices

Let us consider now the integrable hydrodynamics in a
more general case when closed vortex lines are not circles.
In this situation, it is possible to map each vortex contour to
some vortex ring. It is then natural to introduce the (mean)
direction n, as well as the mean area S = πr2
0, with the help
of the expression for momentum of vortex line, P = nS. The
position R0 of the ring center changes linearly in time. A cor-
responding mean velocity of the motion of closed line must be
directed along the momentum, in order to satisfy the conser-
vation law for angular momentum. The mean velocity value
V0, generally speaking, is a function of those fundamental in-
tegrals of motion, which are independent on the origin choice
– the Hamiltonian (i.e. the length L), the momentum, and
the projection on the vector n of the angular momentum. It is
clear also that increasing the contour sizes in λ times should
result in decreasing the velocity in λ times, so that

V0 =

(4.6)

Explicit dependence of the U (ξ, η)-function has been unknown
now. Its ﬁrst argument can be considered as a measure of a
”crumpleness” of the vortex line and changes in the limits
0 ≤ ξ ≤ 1, and the second argument determines a measure of
a spirality of the line. In a more or less reasonable approxima-
tion, which doesn’t lead to excessive errors, one can suppose
that U (ξ, η) ∼ U (1, 0) = 1.
R(ν, s, t) can be represented as the sum:

After introducing the mean characteristics, the mapping

The separation of the mean and oscillatory motions, intro-
duced by means of (4.7), (4.8), (4.6) for each vortex contour,

shows that the mapping R = R(ν, s, t) at each ﬁxed value
a = (ν, s) is a linear function of time with nonlinear oscil-
lations, which are described by the Landau-Lifshits equation
(3.5) or its gauge equivalent (3.6). The linear mean depen-
dence reﬂects the fact that the model under consideration is
a model of free vortices. The collapse thus arises as a result
of a running of one vortex into another. Due to a continuous
distribution of vortex lines, their ”density” increases inﬁnitely
in some point.

A similar situation takes place in the model for large scale
structure formation in the Universe studied by V.I.Arnold,
Ya.B.Zeldovich and S.F.Shandarin [22]. In the basement of
this model, the suggestion lies about initial dust-like distribu-
tion of masses, when their behavior can be described by the
zero-pressure hydrodynamic equations

ρt + div ρv = 0,

dv
dt

= vt + (v∇)v = 0.

(4.9)

(4.10)

The integration of this system in the Lagrangian variables
gives that i) all ﬂuid particles being free move with a constant
velocity

r = a + v(a)t,

(4.11)

is assumed to be non-degenerate: all its eigenvalues are posi-
tive, and the matrix itself can be diagonalized. Hence it fol-
lows immediately that compression along all principal axises

in a-space will have the same law: la ∼ √t0 − t. Therefore,

near the singular point, vorticity Ω will have the self-similar
asymptotics

Ω(r, t) =

,

(4.13)

Ω0(ν)Rs

(t0 − t)(α + γijηiηj )

where η = ∆a/√t0 − t are self-similar variables in a-space.

However, the equation (4.13) does not mean, that compres-
sion in r-space will be the same.

When the Jacobian takes zero value, one of the eigenvalues
of the Jacobi matrix becomes equal to zero. This eigenvalue
(denote it as λ1 ), as it easily to see, coincides with the Jaco-
bian (4.4) at a small vicinity of the collapse point up to the
almost constant multiplier λ2 · λ3.
Represent now the Jacoby matrix ˆJ as a decomposition over
eigenvectors of direct ( ˆJ|ψ(n) >= λn|ψ(n) >) and conjugated
(< ˜ψ(n)| ˆJ = λn < ˜ψ(n)|) spectral problems

Jik ≡

∂xk
∂ai

(4.14)

and ii) the density ρ is expressed through the initial value and
the Jacobian of the mapping (4.11) as follows

Here two sets of eigenvectors of direct and conjugated prob-
lems are mutually orthogonal

ρ(r, t) =

ρ0(a)

J

.

(4.12)

< ˜ψ(n)|ψ(m) >= δnm.

In the framework of this model, appearance of large scale
structures is connected with the breaking phenomenon re-
sulting in density singularities, due to the Jacobian vanishing
for the mapping (4.11).
In a typical situation, these struc-
tures have a pancake shape and can be considered as pcurlo-
galaxies. The formula, analogous to the Eq.
(4.12), takes
place, as we have seen above, for the vorticity Ω – see the
Eq. (2.6). However, there is a diﬀerence from Eq. (4.12),
connected with the vector nature of the Ω ﬁeld.

In the given task we will be interested in a geometric struc-
ture of a the singularity at t → t0, but t < t0, i.e., in some
sense, at the initial stage of collapse, but not at the developed
stage, which has the meaning for astrophysics applications,
but remains rather unclear for the incompressible hydrody-
namics, when viscosity is necessary to be taken into account
at small scales.

In a small vicinity of the collapse point eigenvalues λ2,3 can
be considered as constants, while

λ1 ≡

J

λ2λ3

= (λ2λ3)−1[α(t0 − t) + γij aiaj].

Here, for simplicity, we have placed the origin at the point
a = a0. As for the eigenvectors, they also can be considered
constant.

Let us decompose the vectors x and ∇a in Eq.

(4.14)
through the corresponding bases, denoting their appropriate
projections as Xn and An:

Xn =< x|ψ(n) >,

∂

∂An

=< ˜ψ(n)|∇a > .

In this case the vector a is written in terms of An as follows

aα = Xn

α | ˜ψ(n)|2An.
ψ(n)

B. Structure of the singularity

As a result, Eq. (4.14) can be rewritten in the form

Let us consider in more details the structure of the col-
lapsing region in a typical situation. First, it is clear from
the above discussion that the vorticity distribution near sin-
gularity will be given by the former expression (4.5). Second,
the main features of the singularity will be determined by
the Jacobian, that is the denominator of (4.5). Numerator
(Ω0(a)∇a)R ( tangent vector to the lines) can be taken at
the point a = a0, t = t0 and considered as a constant.
(4.5) the Jacobian expansion contains
positive deﬁnite symmetric matrix γij of its second deriva-
tives taken at the point a = a0, t = t0. At t < t0, this matrix

According to Eq.

∂X1
∂A1

= τ + ΓmnAmAn,

∂X2
∂A2

= λ2,

∂X3
∂A3

= λ3.

(4.15)

(4.16)

Here, the matrix

Γmn = γαβ(λ2λ3)−1ψ(n)

α ψ(m)

β

| ˜ψ(n)|2| ˜ψ(m)|2,

and parameter τ = α(t0 − t)(λ2λ3)−1 is assumed to be small.
It follows from here immediately that size reduction along the
second (X2) and the third (X3) directions is the same as in

6

the auxiliary a-space, i.e., ∼ √τ , but along the ”soft” direc-

tion X1 behaves like τ 3/2. Respectively, in terms of new self-
similar variables ξ1 = X1/τ 3/2, ξ2 = X2/τ 1/2, ξ3 = X3/τ 1/2,
integration of the system gives for ξ2 and ξ3 a linear depen-
dence on η , while for ξ1 it a cubic dependence

ξ1 = (1 + Γij ηiηj )η1 +

Γ11η3

1, i, j = 2, 3 (4.17)

ξ2 = λ2η2, ξ3 = λ3η3. (4.18)

Together with (4.13), the relations (4.17) and (4.18) deter-
mine implicit dependence Ω(r, t). The presence of two diﬀer-
ent self-similarities shows, that the spatial vorticity distribu-
tion becomes strongly ﬂattened in the ﬁrst direction, taking
a pancake form as t → t0.
The direction of the ﬁeld Ω can be found from the incom-
pressibility condition div Ω = 0. It is easy to see that in the
leading order (as t → t0) the gradient of J is determined by
the soft direction e1:

∇J ≈ τ −3/2 ∂J

∂ξ1

e1.

Contributions from two other directions are small in the pa-
rameter τ .

Hence, it follows that vector lines of the ﬁeld Ω lie in the
pancake plane that is in agreement with transversality of mo-
tion of vortex lines (compare with Eq.(2.7)).

V. EXAMPLE OF COLLAPSE IN THE

DEGENERATED CASE

In the previous section we have considered collapse for a
non-degenerated situation, when the only one eigenvalue of
the Jacoby matrix tends to zero at the touching point. Now
we shall consider an example of collapse, when two eigenval-
ues of the Jacoby matrix vanish simultaneously at the col-
lapse point. We will examine an initial vorticity distribution
with the nontrivial topology of vortex lines with linking num-
ber N = 1. This special distribution is the so-called Hopf
mapping. There are several ways how to construct the cor-
responding ﬁeld Ω. We will keep here the approach of the
paper [28].

Following to that work, let us represent the ﬁeld Ω through

the n-ﬁeld (n2 = 1)

Ωα(r) =

1
32

ǫαβγ(n · [∂βn × ∂γ n]),

(5.1)

where the n-ﬁeld is supposed to be a smooth function of coor-
dinates tending to the constant value e at the inﬁnity r → ∞.
It is easy to check that in accordance with Eq.(5.1) each
point n = n0 on the unit sphere S 2 deﬁnes a closed vortex
line . Indeed, parameterization of the unit vector n through
the spherical angles θ and ϕ allows to write down the ﬁeld Ω
as follows

Ω =

1
16

[∇ϕ × ∇ cos θ]),

(5.2)

so that the variables ϕ and cos θ play the role of the Clebsch
variables. Thus, each vortex line coincides in this case with
the intersection of two surfaces ϕ = const and cos θ = const,

i.e. a closed vortex line is the pcurlotype in R3 of a point
on the sphere S 2. By the deﬁnition, the Hopf degree N of
mapping R3 → S 2 is called an integer number of linkages
between arbitrary two vortex lines – pcurlotypes of two points
on the unit sphere. The Hopf mapping (with N = 1) is given
by the next relation:

(n · σ) = U (e · σ)U †, U =

1 + i(a · σ)
1 − i(a · σ)

,

(5.3)

where σ are the Pauli matrices.

Expressing the vector n from here and substituting the

result into Eq.(5.1), one can get (see [29])

Ω0(a) =

e(1 − a2) + 2a(e · a) + 2[e × a]

(1 + a2)3

.

(5.4)

As it was shown in [29], all the ﬂux lines of this ﬁeld are
circles, and each line is linked once with another line. By this
reason, the singularity formation is inevitable.

It is worth to note that the ﬁeld (5.4) has no singular points
in the whole space and its absolute value depends only on the
absolute value |a|. The unit vector ~τ is deﬁned everywhere:

~τ (a) =

e(1 − a2) + 2a(e · a) + 2[e × a]

(1 + a2)

.

(5.5)

The velocity of each ring is connected with the binormal b(ν)
and the radius r(ν) by the relation

V(ν) = b(ν)/r(ν).

The radii r(ν) of rings and their orientations b(ν) are integrals
of motion. Only positions of centers of rings can change, and
this motion occurs with a constant velocity for each ring.

In the given problem, instead of the variables ν and s, it
is convenient to use directly the variables a, in which the
mapping R(a, t) is written as

R(a, t) = a + tV(a),

(5.6)

where the velocity V(a) is expressed through the unit tangent
vector ~τ by means of the relation

V(a) = [~τ (a) × (~τ (a)∇a)~τ (a)].

Hence one can ﬁnd the expression for the Jacobian

(5.7)

(5.8)

J(a, t) = det(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ˆI + t(cid:18) ∂V(a)
∂a (cid:19)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

.

It should be noted that the velocity of each ring is constant
along the vortex line. Therefore the determinant of the matrix
∂V(a)/∂a, which is the coeﬃcient in front of t3 in the previous
expression, is equal to zero identically. As a result, J has a
quadratic dependence on time t only:

J = 1 + tc1(a) + t2c2(a).

Singularity formation corresponds to the case J → 0 at some
point. The collapse moment of time t0 will be determined by
the coeﬃcients c1 and c2 so that t0 will be a minimal positive
root of the equation

minaJ(a, t0) ≡ Jmin(t0) = 0.

7

Calculations by means of Eq-s (5.5), (5.7) and (5.8) lead to
the following expressions:

V(a) =

J(a, t) =

−2
(1 + a2)2 (cid:0)[e × a](1 − a2) + 2a(e · a) − 2ea2(cid:1) , (5.9)
(1 + a2)3 − 8ta3(1 + a2) + 4t2(1 + a2

1 − a2
2)

3 − a2

,

(1 + a2)3

where a3 is the projection of the vector a to the axis e.

Analyzing the latter expression one can show that at t < 1
a minimum of the Jacobian is attained on the symmetry axis,
i.e., at a1 = 0, a2 = 0. In this case

(5.10)

J|axis =

(1 − a2

3)2 + 4(t − a3)2
(1 + a2

3)2

,

(5.11)

hence it becomes clear that the singularity takes place at t0 =
1, a3 = 1, and the Jacobian tends to zero with the quadratic
asymptotics. Thus, in this example

|Ω|max ∼ (t0 − t)−2.

It can be easily veriﬁed also that the Jacoby matrix has two
zero eigenvalues at the touching point which eigenvectors lie
in the plane orthogonal to e.
In the collapse vicinity the
ﬁeld Ω is directed along the vector e. Compression along this
direction is linear in time l3 ∼ (t0−t), but in the perpendicular
plane it is more fast, with the law l1,2 ∼ (t0−t)3/2. As a result,
the singularity structure occurs strongly stretched along the
anisotropy axis.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Considering the hydrodynamic model with the Hamilto-

nian H = R |Ω|dr, we have arrived at the conclusion that

each vortex line in the given system moves independently of
other lines. Just this property makes possible to form singu-
larity in a ﬁnite time for the generalized vorticity Ω(r, t) from
smooth initial data. A typical singularity of this kind looks
like an inﬁnite condensation of the vortex lines near some
point. Thus, the collapse in the integrable hydrodynamics
has purely inertial origin. If one will assume that this type of
collapse is possible also in the Euler hydrodynamics, then the
asymptotics of the vorticity near the singularity point (the
point of vortex ”overturning”) will be given by Eq-s (4.5) or
(4.13) in a non-degenerated situation. That is already clear
from the general consideration. Namely, the curl of the veloc-
ity will blow up as (t0 − t)−1 . Exactly this dependence for
vorticity near a singular point has been observed in practically
all numerical simulations of the Euler equation, including the
above cited: [6], [10,17], [11], [13], [12].

However, not all the simulations are regarded to numerical
integration of the Euler equations for continuous distributions
of vorticity. The ﬁrst numerical experiments [6] relate to in-
vestigation of collapse for two anti-parallel vortex ﬁlaments
which, as it was shown by Crow [14], are linearly unstable
with respect to transverse perturbations ( about the develop-
ment of this direction see also [12]). The theory of collapse for

two thin vortex ﬁlaments, as the nonlinear stage of the Crow
instability, was developed by V.E.Zakharov [7], [8] (see also
[9]). The conclusions of this theory are in a good agreement
with the numerical experiments up to the distances compara-
ble with a core size of ﬁlaments. This theory predicts decreas-

ing distance between vortex ﬁlaments as √t0 − t. For smaller

distances the cores of vortices loose their round shape. They
become ﬂat, and the process of attraction between vortices
becomes more slow [30], [31]. The same tendency was ob-
served also in the numerical experiments of Kerr [10], the
most advanced (in our opinion) for the problem of recon-
nection, and where, unlike [6], collapse of two anti-parallel
vortices was simulated with continuously distributed vortic-
ity. Besides a natural contraction of the minimal distance be-
tween the distributed vortices, these simulations have shown,
for the ﬁrst time, the formation of two singularities in two
symmetric points. While approaching a collapse moment in
time, the explosive growth of the maximal value of vorticity
was observed with the law (t0 − t)−1. According to the recent
publications of Kerr [17], the analysis of numerical data gave
two distinguished scales, one scale being contracted as the
square root: l1 ∼ (t0 − t)1/2, and another as the ﬁrst power
of time: l2 ∼ t0 − t.
In the work of Grauer, Marliani and Germaschewsky [11],
the successfull attempt was undertaken to observe collapse
for the initial condition not possessing a low symmetry. The
initial vorticity was concentrated in the vicinity of a cylinder,
and was modulated over the angle in such a way so that the
simplest symmetries were absent.
In the present time this
experiment has the best spatio-temporal resolution. In this
simulation appearance of a separate collapsing region was ob-
served with the vorticity growth at the center as (t0 − t)−1.
Thus, the results of the numerical simulations for ideal hy-
drodynamics go along with the concept of collapse as a process
of caustic formation for the solenoidal ﬁeld. There is an agree-
ment for behavior of the vorticity maximum. Concerning the
spatial structure of the collapsing domain, we can make only
a qualitative agreement. The results of the papers [30], [31]
(where some contraction of the vortex core was observed at
the initial stage of reconnection neglecting viscosity) and also
the results of Kerr seem to support our theory. We would
like to pay attention to the numerical results of the paper [33]
where for short-time dynamics for the initial conditions in the
form of the Taylor-Green vortex and for random initial con-
ditions it was observed formation of thin vortex layers with
high vorticity that also support our predictions.

All these results allow one to say that the scenario pre-

sented here looks like very plausible.

We would like to repeat once more, that if such scenario
takes place then behavior of the vorticity near of singular
point is deﬁned by Eq-s (4.5) or (4.13). The structure of this
domain should be highly anisotropic: in one of two directions
perpendicular to the vorticity, there is more rapid contraction
(∼ τ 3/2) than with respect to other directions (∼ τ 1/2). The
spatial distribution becomes close to the two-dimensional one
familiar to a tangential discontinuity. The velocity of ﬂow in
this region can be approximated with a good accuracy by the
linear dependence

i.e. the ﬂow looks like a shear ﬂow. The given type of col-

v⊥ ∼ ΩmaxX1,

8

lapse, according to the classiﬁcation of [32], belongs to a weak
collapse: the energy captured into singularity (with account
of the viscosity ν) tends to zero as ν → 0. It is interesting to
note that the dissipation rate ∼ R Ω2dr from the collapsing
region also vanishes when ν → 0.
One should note once more that unlike the model of free
vortices considered here, in the Euler hydrodynamics vortex
lines interact pairly in accordance with the Hamiltonian

HEuler =

1

8π Z Z Rs(ν, s) · Rξ(µ, ξ)
|R(ν, s) − R(µ, ξ)|

d2νds d2µdξ.

(5.12)

From the viewpoint of investigation of the collapse problem it
is very important that the interaction function (i.e. the Green
function for the Laplace operator) has the singularity for equal
arguments R(ν, s) → R(µ, ξ). If this singularity would be ab-
sent, i.e. if the interaction function would be completely reg-
ular, then any initial vortex line distribution equivalent in the
sense of iso-vorticity to a smooth ﬁeld Ω0(a) , even very singu-
lar distribution, would produce a suﬃciently smooth velocity
ﬁeld v(r).
In a smooth velocity ﬁeld, an initial singularity
of the generalized vorticity could not disappear in subsequent
moment of time, it could be only transported and deformated
by the ﬂuid ﬂow. As far as the equations of motion for an in-
viscid substance are time-reversible, it follows from this, that
the formation of singularity from a smooth initial data also
would not possible. So, the existence and possible types of
collapse of vortex lines, in the systems with the quadratic on
Ω Hamiltonians, depend on the asymptotics of the interaction
function G(r1, r2) at r1 → r2. So, for a better understanding
of the collapse problem in hydrodynamics, it is reasonable to
investigate such systems, for which the interaction function
has the asymptotics G ∼ |r1 − r2|−q , and the exponent q is
not necessary equal to the unity.
What is the inﬂuence of viscosity on the structure of col-
lapsing region? How does the given type of collapse have
eﬀect on turbulent spectra? That are only few of the most
important questions, which need investigation. It would be
interesting to verify numerically our hypothesis about possi-
bility of (quasi-)inertial collapse in ideal hydrodynamics, both
in Eulerian variables and in the vortex line representation.

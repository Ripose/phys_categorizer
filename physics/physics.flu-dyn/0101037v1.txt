Abstract

We present numerical simulation of 2D turbulent ﬂow using a new
model for the subgrid scales which are computed using a dynamic equa-
tion linking the subgrid scales with the resolved velocity. This equation
is not postulated, but derived from the constitutive equations under
the assumption that the non-linear interactions of subgrid scales be-
tween themselves are equivalent to a turbulent viscosity. This results
in a linear stochastic equation for the subgrid scales, which can be
numerically solved by a decomposition of the subgrid scales into local-
ized wave-packets. These wave-packets are transported by the resolved
scale velocity and have wavenumbers and amplitude which evolve ac-
cording to the resolved strain and the stochastic forcing. The perfor-
mances of our model are compared with Direct Numerical Simulations
of decaying and forced turbulence. For a same resolution, numerical
simulations using our model allow for a signiﬁcant reduction of the
computational time (of the order of 100 in the case we consider), and
allow the achievement of signiﬁcantly larger Reynolds number than the
direct method.

Introduction

The dynamics of high Reynolds number turbulent ﬂow couples a large range
of scales from the characteristic size of the domain to the dissipative scales.
This range is usually too large to be fully resolved by Direct Numerical
Simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations (DNS). This is the case for many
applications like in aeronautics, geophysics or astrophysics where the typical
Reynolds numbers are of the order of 106 to 1012. The largest Reynolds
numbers which can be achieved by DNS are of the order of 104 to 105 [1,
2]. The diﬃculty of direct simulation of turbulent ﬂows at high Reynolds
number arises because of two scaling laws: ﬁrst, the memory requirement to
be able to deal with all the scale of motions growths like Re9/4, where Re is
the Reynolds number; second, the time stepping to be used to advance the
equations has to be computed using the smallest resolved scale. As a result,
computational time usually growths like Re3. Despite of the growth of the
computer power [3], the direct simulation of all realistic problems will not
be conceivable before a long time.

Part of these diﬃculties could be circumvented if one could ﬁnd an ef-
ﬁcient approximate scheme to model the small scales of the turbulent ﬂow,
which usually monopolize 90 per cent of the computations and, for most
applications, do not need to be known with the same precision as the large
scales. From an algorithmic point of view, several methods have been pro-
posed to try to describe the small turbulent scales with less degree of freedom
than in a DNS like for example, sparse Fourier transform [4], rareﬁed modes
[5], wavelets [6], self-adaptative grid mesh [7, 8]. From a theoretical point
of view, the eﬀort has been put on the model of the action of the small
scales onto the larger scales of motion, or onto the small scales themselves,
to be able to deal with simpler and cheaper systems to compute. In the ex-
treme case of large eddy simulations (LES) or random averaged numerical
simulations (RANS), the eﬀect of the small scales at large scales is directly
modeled as a function of the resolved or mean scales of motions, resulting
in both memory and computational gain. This is often done at the price of
introduction of arbitrary parameters, which require calibration and which
lower the predictive power of the simulation. Also, some models are not
theoretically satisfying, since they break for example the basic symmetries
of the original equations [9].

In this paper, we continue a study initiated in [10] and develop a new
dynamic model for the turbulent subgrid quantities which is directly de-
rived from the constitutive equations of motions. This model respects all

2

the basic symmetries of the original equations, as well as their conservation
properties. The main assumption underlying the model is that the smaller
turbulent scales are much less energetic than the resolved scales, and so,
that their main interactions are with the resolved ﬂow. It then appears rea-
sonable to try to model these main interactions with as few approximations
as possible, while more freedom is allowed regarding their mutual interac-
tions. In the model we consider, the interactions between the resolved and
subgrid scales are taken into account without any approximation, while the
mutual interactions between subgrid scales are replaced by a turbulent vis-
cosity. In 2D geometry, where energy condensation at large scale guarantees
that the dynamics of the small scales is mainly non-local in scales this tur-
bulent viscosity is so small that it can be set to zero in some simple cases
[11]. This allows a parameter free model of the subgrid scales, which will
be described in the ﬁrst part of this paper. In situations where dynamic
processes at small scales, like vortex stretching, are important to regulate
any small-scale instability, or even in 2D when ”large” and ”small” scales
are not well enough separated, the turbulent viscosity cannot be set to zero
[12]. This option introduces a free parameter into the model, but, since it
appears at a sub-dominant level, we may expect that its choice is not so
critical to the success of the model.

After parameterization of the non-linear interactions between the sub-
grid scales, their resulting equation of motion becomes linear. This essential
feature has two advantages: ﬁrst, it enables, in certain simple ﬂow geome-
tries, analytical solutions for the subgrid-scale dynamics as a function of the
resolved quantities, thereby closing the equations of motions at the resolved-
scale level. This property was used to obtain analytical solution for mean
proﬁles in channel ﬂows [13, 14, 15] or for the Planetary Surface Layer
[16, 17]. Second advantage of the linear description is that it allows for
more eﬃcient algorithms of integrations, using Lagrangian methods where
the time stepping is done via a criterion based on the resolved scales. This
allows numerical computations with a larger time step than DNS, and thus,
at a lower computational cost.

An essential part of our model is the averaged Reynolds stresses de-
scribing the feedback of the subgrid scales onto the resolved component. In
[10], we considered the scale separation parameter to be much less than the
nonlinearity of the small scales and derived a feedback term in which the
quadratic in the small-scale amplitude terms gave the main contribution into
the Reynolds stress. Then, the model that consisted of two coupled “ﬂu-
ids” (the resolved and the subgrid one) was used to solve several problems

3

with ([18]) and without scale separation ([10]), the later being the typical
problems such as the forced turbulence, the vortex merger and a turbulence
decay.
It was noticed that in the problems without a natural scale sepa-
ration, such a model described very well the small-scale dynamics whereas
improvements in modeling of the large scales (which is the main aim of the
LES) was much more modest. The situation was clariﬁed in [11] where
direct numerical evaluations of the diﬀerent contributions to the Reynolds
stress were made. It was shown that in the problems without the scale sep-
aration the dominant contribution to the Reynolds stress comes from the
linear rather than quadratic in the small-scale amplitude term.

In the present contribution, we focus on advancing the numerical ap-
proach introduced in [10] by introducing a better model for the turbulent
Reynolds stress based on the results of the a priori tests performed in [11].
Also, a more eﬃcient procedure is used in this paper to generate the subgrid
vorticity and velocity ﬁelds. Our goal here is to test our model both as a
numerical method for an improved DNS, in the sense that we can compute
the whole range of scales at a lower computational cost, and as pseudo LES
method, in the sense that we compute only the larger scales, at an even
lower computational cost. For the sake of simplicity, we shall consider here
only the two-dimensional case, where both the hypothesis of the turbulent
model [11] and its consequences [18, 10] have been studied in detail. The
generalization to the 3D case is the subject of an ongoing research.

2 The turbulence model

2.1 Scale decomposition

We consider a two-dimensional incompressible inviscid ﬂow obeying the
equations:

∂tω + div(uω) = ν∆ω,
div u

= 0,

(

where u is the velocity and ν is the viscosity. In 2D geometry, the vorticity
has only one non-zero component that we denote by ω. The resolved- and
the subgrid-scale part of the velocity and the vorticity ﬁelds are deﬁned via
a ﬁltering procedure:

U(x, t) = u(x, t) =

G(x

x′

)u(x′

, t)dx′

(5)

(7)

Ω(x, t) = ω(x, t) =

G(x

x′

)ω(x′

, t)dx′

−

Z
Here, G is a ﬁlter, such that the resolved scales contain the main part of the
total energy. In Section III.C, we shall propose a special shape of G obeying
this condition, and which is well adapted to our numerical method.

Each ﬁeld is then decomposed as follows

u(x, t) = U(x, t) + u′
′
ω(x, t) = Ω(x, t) + ω

(x, t),
(x, t),

where the primes denote subgrid-scale quantities. Inserting this decompo-
sition into the Navier-Stokes equations and separating the resolved and the
subgrid-scale parts, we get a set of coupled equations:

∂tΩ + div (UΩ) + div (u′Ω)

+ div (Uω′) + div (u′ω′) = ν∆Ω,

.

The second up to the sixth terms of the l.h.s. of (7) are the contributions
due to non-local interactions between the resolved and the subgrid scales.
The last two terms in the l.h.s. of (7) are the contributions due to non-
linear (local in scale space) interactions among the subgrid scales. In the
favorable case where most of the energy is at the resolved scales, these last
two terms can be expected to negligible with respect to, e.g., the second
up to the fourth terms of the l.h.s. of (7).
Indeed, in a recent detailed
numerical analysis of the system (6) and (7), Laval et al [11] showed that for
a very steep ﬁlter (when the ﬁlter G is a cut-oﬀ in the spectral space), the
small-scale dynamics (and thus the large-scale dynamics) is independent of
the local interactions: when the later are neglected, the small-scale velocity
and vorticity ﬁeld are not signiﬁcantly changed, in both forced and decaying
turbulence, even after several eddy turn-over times [11]. The analysis has
also shown that in 2D turbulence, the leading order contribution at both
large and small-scale comes from the correlations involving the large-scale

5

velocity ﬁeld, i.e. UΩ and Uω′. The next leading order contribution comes
from the correlations between small-scale velocity and vorticity u′ω′, while
the correlation between small-scale velocity and large-scale vorticity u′Ω
gives the lowest contribution.

2.2 A priori numerical estimates

In the present case, the ﬁlter G is smoother, and subgrid scales include both
large and small scales. It is thus important to conduct additional numerical
evaluation of the various terms of (6) and (7) using a smooth ﬁlter, to
check the validity of the non-locality assumption for the subgrid scales. We
performed an apriori test with the ﬁlter which will be used in our model.
The choice of the ﬁlter will be discussed in section D. The test was done
using a vorticity ﬁeld from a DNS on a 10242 grid. The Figures 1 and 2
give the distribution of each non-linear terms involved in the resolved scales
and the subﬁlter-scales equations. The result of the ﬁltering process one the
initial ﬁeld is shown ﬁg. 3. Even with a smooth ﬁlter, the non-linear term
involving only subgrid scales are still small compared to the higher order
term.

2.3 The model

Keeping only the leading order contributions, the coupled equations (6) and
(7) become:

∂tΩ + div UΩ + div Uω′ = ν∆Ω,

∂tω

) = F + νt∆ω

F (x, t) =

Here, νt is a turbulent viscosity, which will be introduced to damp the small-
scale noise arising in our numerical scheme and F is a force which describes
the subgrid-scale generation via the enstrophy cascade (energy cascade in
3D).

3.1 Numerical strategy and performances

The resolved-scale equation has the form of an Euler equation with an ad-
ditional forcing coming from the interaction with the subgrid-scale motions.
One is therefore led to standard strategies to solve this equation, depending
on the type of the ﬂow (spectral methods for ﬂows in simple periodic geom-
etry, or ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite elements for more complicated geometries).
Here, we shall consider the periodic case, thereby using a spectral code for
solving the resolved-scale equation. This code is described in [19].

The situation is markedly diﬀerent at the subgrid level, where the ba-
sic equation is linear in the subgrid motions, with an inhomogeneous part

provided by the subgrid scale generation via the enstrophy cascade. This lin-
earity suggests a solution strategy based on projection of the subgrid scales
onto appropriate modes. Since the subgrid scales are usually very inhomo-
geneous (e.g., vorticity ﬁlaments), it seems logical to use a decomposition of
the subgrid-scale velocity ﬁeld into localized modes, thereby optimizing the
memory requirements to store the subgrid-scale ﬁelds. A popular local mode
decomposition uses wavelets (see e.g. [20]). Wavelets are however sometimes
diﬃcult to implement, and are not very handy to use in analytical compu-
tations. Here, we choose to use a Gabor decomposition, which provides a
localized description while allowing theoretical manipulations similar to that
obtained with Fourier modes. The linearity of the subgrid motions also pro-
vides room for a further computational time reduction via semi-Lagrangian
methods of integration, using a time step related to the resolved scale. The

numerical expected performances of our model, integrated using the semi-
Lagrangian, Gabor method, at a given resolution and total integration time,
is given in Table 1, and compared with both standard spectral methods
based on FFT, and a LES approach based on FFT. Computational time for
several particular examples is given in table 2 which shows an obvious gain
in speed for our method with respect to the DNS. If we now compare with
a classical LES, our method is somewhat slower because it is necessary to
keep a suﬃcient number of localized modes for accurate description of the
Reynolds stresses. However, a substantial gain in accuracy is achieved in
comparison with traditional LES because of the better description of the
nonlocal interaction of scales.

3.2 Description of the algorithm

Our algorithm of resolution of the turbulent model is based on ﬁve steps:

1 Compute the force F (9) using the resolved and subgrid ﬁelds at time

Step 1 and 5 involve standard procedures linked with our resolved scale
code (in the present case a Fourier spectral code with an Adams-Bashforth
time stepping where a full desaliasing was introduced by keeping only the
ﬁrst 2/3 smaller wavenumbers in each direction, see [19]). Step 2, 3 and 4
involve new original procedures, based on interesting properties of the Gabor
transform. For the sake of clarity , we present here only main results, leaving
detailed computations in appendices.

3.3 The continuous Gabor transform

The Gabor transform (GT) is deﬁned as

ˆu′(x, k, t) =

∗

f (ǫ

(x

)) eik·(x−x′) u′

(x′

) dx′

,

(10)

Z

−
where f is a rapidly decreasing function at inﬁnity. Note that 1/ǫ∗ has
a meaning of the scale separation length.
It has to be chosen to lie in
between of the integral scale and the Kolmogorov scale, the later being far
in the subgrid range in many applications. For LES purposes, 1/ǫ∗ has to
be close to (but not less than) the minimal resolved scale (grid scale dh in
our case). Thus, to derive our model we need to assume the subﬁlter-scale
wavenumber k to be greater than ǫ∗ and use ǫ∗/k as a small parameter.
Technically, however, is convinient to keep k ﬁxed and perform expansions
in small ǫ∗.

In the special case where f = √G, where G is the ﬁlter (see eq. (3)), we

have the following simple reconstruction formulae:

3.4 The discretized optimum Gabor transform

The continuous Gabor transform is not suitable for numerical implemen-
tation. Moreover, because it involves both position and wavenumbers, it
theoretically describes a given ﬁeld via a much larger mode numbers than
in traditional spectral methods (typically N 2D versus N D in D dimensions).
However, as discussed previously, inhomogeneous ﬁelds may be represented
with a high precision by a much smaller set of Gabor modes than the theo-
retical number, a number even potentially smaller than N D (see e.g. [21]).
The algorithm we devised uses N D Gabor modes and, therefore, there is a
room for further code optimization.

3.4.1 The discretization

The discretization of the subgrid ﬁeld in the Gabor space is done via a
Particle In Cell (PIC) method. This method is traditionally used in plasma
physics, but was used previously in hydrodynamics by Nazarenko et al [22] to
study the interaction of sound wave-packets with turbulence. Details about
In this method, the Gabor modes
the method can also be found in [10].
of the subgrid-scale vorticity ﬁeld are replaced with discrete wave-packets
(particles). For example, the vorticity ﬁeld ˆω′(x, k, t) is discretized with Np
wave-packets α in the Gabor space:

ˆω′(x, k, t) =

ˆσα(t) Sx(x

xα(t)) Sk(k

kα(t)).

(16)

−

−

Np

Xα=1

12

In (16), α labels the wave-packet. Note that our representation allows several
wave-packets with diﬀerent wavenumbers to be located at the same position
x, like in the Gabor transform. Here Sx and Sk are some interpolating
functions (particle “size”). Since the computation of non-linear terms in the
resolved-scale equation involves a second order spatial derivative, we are led
to choose a linear interpolation in the x direction.
In the k direction, a
zero particle “thickness” turns out to be suﬃcient for our purpose. We thus
adopt the following representation,

Sx(x) = S(x)S(y),
Sk(k) = δ(p)δ(q),

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

where x = (x, y), k = (p, q), δ is the Dirac function and the function S(η)
is deﬁned by:

S(η) =

)/dh if

otherwise,

(

Here, dh is a length scale governing the accuracy of the discretization. Its
choice will be discussed later on.

The PIC algorithm of reconstruction of the continuous ﬁelds from the
discretized coeﬃcients provides a natural ﬁlter G and the function f to be
used in the Gabor transform through (see appendix D):

3.4.3 Optimum discrete Gabor transform
For a given ﬁeld ω′(x, t), associated with a grid of size 2π/N , our ”optimum”
discrete Gabor transform only retains one wavenumber per position (i.e. N 2
Gabor modes, for a N 2 initial discrete ﬁeld). This wavenumber, and the
amplitude of the corresponding Gabor mode are chosen as follows: we use
the exact relation between the ﬁeld and its N 2 wave-packet components

An easy way to satisfy (26) exactly is to create one wave-packet at each grid
point, so that Np = N 2. Applying equation (26) at each grid point xi we
then obtain:

1. Since the vorticity ω′

(x, t) is real, each wave-packet at position xα and with
wavenumber kα will have a partner wave-packet with same amplitude, at the same lo-
cation and with an opposite wavenumber −kα.

inary part of the amplitude of the wave-packet, which is still a free parame-
ter at this stage. We then select the phase of the GT by requiring that the
imaginary part of the wave packet equals its real part. Other choices could
have been made, but this one turns out to simplify the computations. The
characteristics of each wave-packets αi can ﬁnally be summarized as:

This procedure creates N 2 wave-packets, from any vorticity ﬁeld on a grid
of size 2π/N and can be used to initialize the subgrid scale vorticity ﬁeld
from any given initial condition or to GT the force F by transforming it into
an equivalent vorticity ﬁeld ω′

f (x, t) = F (x, t)/dt.

3.5 The Lagrangian scheme

A Lagrangian interpretation of the subgrid scale equation (15) shows that
its time integration is equivalent to the evolution of each wave-packet in
the (x,k) space. Each wave-packet carries a complex amount of Gabor
vorticity (σα) and is advected at the resolved-scale velocity U(x), while its
wavenumber and amplitude evolve according to the local resolved strain.
For the trajectory of the wave-packet and its amplitude we have

˙xα = U(xα(t)),

By these equations, the wave-packets evolve continuously in the physical
space in between the grid points associated with the ﬁnite, resolved-scale
resolution. To ﬁnd the resolved-scale quantities at the position of each par-
ticle (i.e. possibly in between grid mesh points), an interpolation procedure
is used via the functions Sx and Sk associated with the PIC method.

3.6

Initial conditions

All the simulations used the same initial random vorticity ﬁeld with all the
energy concentrated at very large scales ( the initial energy spectrum is
given by E(k) = ke−(k−ko)2
with ko = 1). In practise, the noise associated
with the PIC method is a function of the number of wave-packets used for
computation. If the initial condition is such that the initial grid on which
the vorticity is deﬁned is too coarse (M too small), one can use a two step
procedure to reach a reasonable number of wave-packets:
in a ﬁrst stage
of the simulation, we create at each time step M 2 wave-packets with the
vorticity ω′
f (x, t) = F (x, t)/dt created by the forcing F . During this stage,
the wave-packets which were created at earlier times are moved into the
phase space using the ray equations (31,32), but their amplitude is kept
constant. This procedure is used until the total number of wave-packet
reaches a desired number. From this point on, the wave-packet creation is
shut down, and the wave-packets are evolved according to (31,32,33).

3.7 Noise reduction and eﬀective turbulent viscosity

For inviscid simulations (when the turbulent viscosity is taken equal to 0),
the numerical procedure develops a noise at very subgrid scales, which is
a function both of the integration time and the total number of particles.
We have found that an eﬃcient way to reduce this subgrid-scale noise could
be achieved by periodically recreating a new set of Np wave-packets via
ﬁrst a rebuilding of the vorticity ﬁeld in the physical space, on a grid of
Np using (11), followed by a re-creation of wave-packets using (30).

unchanged, and therefore does not aﬀect directly the resolved scale.

turbulent viscosity, which cannot be estimated a priori but which adjusts
itself to the noise level.

3.8 Test of the accuracy of the method

To test the accuracy of our numerical method, we have performed a priori
tests using data from a DNS at high resolution. The total vorticity ﬁeld was
divided into a subgrid-and a resolved-scale ﬁeld using the same ﬁlter than in
our model. The subgrid-scale ﬁeld is further discretized into wave-packets
according to eq. (30). A comparison was then made between the various
components of the stresses in the DNS, and in our discretization scheme.
The result of is shown ﬁg. 4, which shows the square modulus of each of
the three Reynolds stress components with respect to their wavenumbers.
The accuracy of the discretized reconstruction of each terms is remarkable
for the large scales. At very small scales (k > 42), the discretization tends
to produce a noise in the components of the Reynolds stress involving the
subgrid-scale velocity. In our case, we do not consider these terms so that
we do not have to bother about this noise.
In situations where one, or
two of these troublesome terms are considered, the noise can be removed
via a ﬁltering at small scale.
In spectral simulations, this truncature is
provided naturally via the procedure to remove aliasing, which ﬁlters out
modes larger than 2kmax/3 where kmax is the maximum wavenumber of the
resolved-scale ﬁeld. The inset of ﬁgure 4 shows the comparison between the
total real Reynolds stresses versus the total modeled Reynolds stress after
desaliasing. The agreement is nearly perfect.

4 Numerical results

Our method can be used to perform two kind of simulations, depending on
whether one is interested in the small-scale behavior or not. In the ﬁrst case,
one needs to model the subgrid scales with a large number of wave-packets,
so as to be able to reconstruct the small-scale ﬁeld with a good accuracy.
Typically, one needs about Np = N 2 wave-packets to be able to reconstruct
faithfully details at scale 2π/N and to produce a result which may be com-
pared with a Direct Numerical Simulation at resolution N 2.
In the case
when only large scales matter, one needs to keep the smallest number of
wave-packet necessary to compute accurately the Reynolds stresses at the
wavenumber cut-oﬀ. Since the resolved- scale ﬁeld at the cut-oﬀ kc = M/2
produces (by non-linear beating) information up to scale 2π/M , we used
a minimum of Np = M 2 wave-packets in our ”Large Eddy Simulations”.
Finally, note that our method allows nearly inviscid computations, since it
does not require the existence of a viscosity at large scale and since it uses a
minimal ”eﬀective viscosity” which starts acting only at scales 2π/M . Very
large Reynolds number can then be achieved via an adequate number of
wave-packets.

We present results illustrating these points in two classical situations, -
decaying and forced turbulence. In each case, the performance of our model
are discussed and compared with results from the DNS and other popular
subgrid-scale parameterizations used in 2D turbulence.

4.1 Decaying turbulence

For the decaying case, the initial condition was chosen so that the energy
is concentrated at very large scales. The reference DNS was performed at a
resolution N 2 = 10242 with a viscosity ν = 1.8 10−4, leading to a Reynolds
104. The simulation was stopped after approximatively 50
number Re
turnover times, by which time the initial condition has evolved into a robust
dipole structure. The separation between resolved and subgrid scale used
for our model is taken at kc = 21, corresponding to a computation over a
grid 642.

∼

Let us ﬁrst compare the DNS to our model using a large number of
wave-packets (Np = 5122). We ran two diﬀerent simulations: one in which
the viscosity at resolved scale was set to ν = 1.8 10−4, like in the DNS
(”viscous” simulation); another one in which ν was set to zero at resolved
scale (”inviscid” simulation). The total simulation time of each simulation

19

is about 1h30 on a Sun workstation, roughly 150 times less than the DNS.
The total vorticity ﬁeld after 50 turn over times, reconstructed by adding
the contribution from the resolved and subgrid scales, is shown in Fig. 5
and compared with the vorticity ﬁeld of the DNS. A global comparison for
small and large scales can also be done via energy spectra. This is done in
Fig. 6.

Figure 5: Total vorticity ﬁeld of decaying turbulence after 50 turnover times
as computed by DNS on a 10242 grid with viscosity ν = 1.8 10−4 (left)
compared with the same ﬁeld computed by the model M0 described in table
2 (right).

Clearly, the two pictures display good overall similarities at large scales,
and marked diﬀerences at smaller scales. The largest structures are very sim-
ilar and they are well localized even after 50 turnover times. The spectra in
the two simulations overlap. The viscous simulation gives large-scale struc-
tures which are in closer agreement with the (viscous) DNS (see Table 2).
Together, these results conﬁrm that at large scale, the dynamically impor-
tant coupling term between resolved and subgrid scale is the term div(U ω′),
in agreement with the dynamical analysis of Laval et al [11], performed us-
ing a cut-oﬀ ﬁlter. At smaller scales, our model seems to produce thinner
ﬁlaments and smaller structures. This eﬀect is clearly visible on the spectra
of the two simulations: in the DNS, the k−3 inertial law starts to level oﬀ
towards k = 60 (due to viscous eﬀects), while in our model, the power law
extends over a wider range of scales, up to approximately k = 100. To check
whether this diﬀerence comes from our subgrid scale scheme, we performed
a direct comparison of the smallest scales of the simulation k > 21. Fig.

20

Figure 6: The energy spectra obtained by the same simulation as in ﬁg. 2
compared with the spectra obtained by some other methods including our
model with parameters M0 from the table 2.

7 shows such a comparison at some earlier time (after about 15 turnover
times), when the small scales have not yet been washed out by viscosity. At
this time, diﬀerences are negligible, proving that our model also captures
the dominant coupling mechanism at subgrid scales. This ﬁnding is also
in agreement with the dynamical analysis of Laval et al [11]. The further
diﬀerences arising over longer time scales can therefore be due to two eﬀects:
one is the error accumulation due to sub-dominant neglected terms in our
model (like the terms involving coupling of the resolved vorticity Ω with
the subgrid velocity u′); the second is viscous eﬀects. We believe that the
ﬁrst possibility is ruled out by the dynamical analysis of Laval et al [11],
in which numerical simulations of our model equations were performed us-

ing the same viscosity than in the direct numerical simulations 2. In that
case, the diﬀerences at small scales appear to be negligible. We therefore
interpret the diﬀerences between the two models as a viscous eﬀect, and,
actually, as an indication of the lower eﬀective viscosity in our model. This
would explain both the later bending of the spectra, and the ﬁner structure
of the ﬁlaments.

The second series of comparison were performed using the minimum
number of wave-packet, equal in the present case to Np = 1282.
In such
a case, the number of wave-packets does not allow accurate reconstruction
for the scales less than 2π/128. The simulation is however much faster, and
takes only 8 minutes of computational time. The total large-scale vorticity
ﬁeld after 50 turn over times is compared with the corresponding large-scale
vorticity ﬁeld of the DNS in Fig. 8. The agreement is still very good and
to quantify this agreement, we computed the correlation coeﬃcient between
the two simulations, deﬁned by:

C1,2 =

1<i,j<64 ω1(i, j)ω2(i, j)

1<i,j<64 ω1(i, j)2

where ω1(i, j) and ω2(i, j) are the large-scale vorticity ﬁeld. This corre-
lation coeﬃcient was computed at two diﬀerent times, corresponding to 15

and 50 turnover time, and reported in table 2. At earlier time, our three
models (viscous or not) are all characterized by a very good correlation co-
eﬃcient (about 99 percent). At later time, a slight diﬀerence appear. In
fact, the best correlations are achieved by the viscous model, and the model
with the least number of subgrid-scale modes. This is not surprising, since
our noise removing procedure produces an eﬀective viscosity which is larger
as the number of subgrid-scale modes decreases. The high resolution model
M1 is then the less viscous model of all three, and therefore, can be expected
to produces the largest diﬀerence with respect to the viscous DNS.

Two other popular 2D turbulent model were also tested along the same
line. In the ﬁrst one (HDNS), the viscous term ν∆Ω of the Navier-Stokes
equation is replaced by a ”hyper-viscous” term νp∆pΩ. In our simulations,
we took p = 8 and νp = 10−18. The second model is the Anticipated Poten-
tial Vorticity Model (APVM) developed by Sadourny and Basdevant [23].
Both models are very cheap, taking only about 2 minutes of computational
time. They are also less accurate, as can be seen from both the Fig. 8,
and the table. In the HDNS 642, the correlation coeﬃcient is only about 50
percent in the end of the simulation. For the APVM, it is higher (about 75
percent), but still lower than our ”minimal model”. The energy spectra of
the 4 simulations can also be compared. This is done in Fig. 6. Our model
develops an energy spectrum very close to the APVM one, and slightly less
steep than the DNS at scales close to the cut-oﬀ. This is because at this
scale, viscous eﬀects start being felt and tend to bend the spectrum. The
HDNS spectrum is much steeper near the cut-oﬀ than both the reference
DNS and the two other models.

4.2 Forced turbulence

Similar simulations were performed in the case of forced turbulence. In such
a case, our model was ran with M 2 = 642 resolved-scale Fourier modes, and
Np = 5122 subgrid-scale Gabor modes, and no additional viscosity. Run
were also performed using a HDNS or the APVM model over 642 Fourier
modes. The initial condition is a vorticity ﬁeld with an energy spectrum
concentrated at the forced wavenumber (k=15) and with a small amount
of total energy. The simulation was forced by keeping constant the energy
of the mode k=(15,0). In this situation, the vorticity ﬁeld is progressively
built via the stochastic forcing, which is itself strongly dependent on the
exact structure of the vorticity ﬁeld (since it must aim at keeping one mode
constant). Due to the developing spectral cascades, the scale interactions

23

become less nonlocal and we may then expect sub-dominant terms to play
an enhanced role (with respect to the decaying case). Indeed, we have ob-
served that the vorticity ﬁelds in the DNS and in the model do not exactly
correspond: both simulations display similar small scale intense vortices,
but they are not located at the same places. This eﬀect can also be seen
more clearly in the spectra. They are shown in ﬁg. 9. Due to the chaoticity,
they all diﬀer at the mode k = 1 which is the most sensitive to the exact
position of each individual vortex. At smaller scales, marked diﬀerences ap-
pear between the models. Clearly, the HDNS gives the worst result, with a
large deﬁcit of energy over all scales. This is because in this case, the forcing
scale is very close to the scale at which the dissipation takes place, and most
of the energy is dissipated before the inverse cascade to larger scales can
occur. The two other models, which do not introduce an explicit dissipa-
tion at the cut-oﬀ scale, perform much better. The APVM model tends to
overestimate the rate of energy at the largest scale and to underestimate
it in the inertial range. Our model slightly underestimates the amount of
energy at the largest scale, but gives results very close to the DNS in the
inertial range of scale. At scales smaller than the cut-oﬀ, both the DNS
and our model produce an energy spectra steeper than the k−3 law. At the
largest wavenumber, the beginning of the viscous range is clearly visible in
the DNS but not in our model. This is again an indication of the large
Reynolds number achieved by our model. As for computational times, the
performances are similar to the decaying case.

5 Discussion

We developed a new dynamic model of subgrid-scale turbulence based on a
simple hypothesis about the subgrid-scale evolution. This approach is diﬀer-
ent from traditional turbulent models since our model provides expressions
of the turbulent Reynolds sub-grid stresses via estimates of the sub-grid
velocities rather than velocities correlations. The subgrid-scale dynamic is
given by a linear equation, describing the advection of subgrid-scale wave-
packets with the mean ﬂow. This feature allows a reduction of the time
step used in the simulation, via the use of a pseudo-Lagrangian method.
We thereby achieved a reduction of the computational time by a factor
150 in the typical cases we considered. Our method can also be used for
Large Eddy Simulation strategies, in which only the large scales are com-
puted. This allows a large memory savings, and an additional reduction of
the computational time (typically a factor 10 in the case we considered).
The resulting simulation is more costly than a traditional LES simulation,
based on Fast Fourier Transform algorithms (like hyperviscosity or vorticity
dissipative schemes). It could however become more competitive for more
complicated geometries, where ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes become more ap-
propriate than FFT. This would make LES models based on hyperviscous
schemes much more costly, while our method would proportionally keep at
the same computational performance.

In the present paper, only 2D turbulence has been considered. As is well
known, 2D turbulence is very special, because there is no vortex stretch-
ing. One may therefore wonder whether our model could be applied to
3D ﬂows. To answer this question, Laval and Dubrulle [12] have recently
performed a numerical analysis of the hypotheses pertaining our turbulent
model. The main hypothesis is that the subgrid dynamics can be very well
approximated by an equation in which non-local terms are retained, while
local terms (non-linear in the subgrid velocities) are replaced by a turbulent
viscosity. The numerical analysis, performed via a numerical simulation of
the coupled resolved and approximate subgrid equations indeed showed that
such hypothesis is valid, insofar as both the energy spectra, the structures
and the statistical properties of such a model were very close to that of
a DNS. Even so this analysis can only be performed at a rather moderate
Reynolds number (80 to 200, based on the Taylor scale), we ﬁnd this analysis
encouraging.

Using the analytical deﬁnition of these terms with respect the the subgrid

D Choice of the ﬁlter

The choice of the interpolating function Sx(x) (eq. 17) dictates the shape
of the ﬁlter and, therefore, of the unknown function f (x) in the deﬁnition
of the Gabor Transform. The proof proceeds via the quantity ω′2(x, t), by
equating the formula of the ﬁlter discretized on a regular grid with a cell

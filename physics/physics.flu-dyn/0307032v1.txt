We report the observation of two types of Sommerfeld precursors (or forerunners) on the surface
of a layer of mercury. When the ﬂuid depth increases, we observe a transition between these
two precursor surface waves in good agreement with the predictions of asymptotic analysis. At
depths thin enough compared to the capillary length, high frequency precursors propagate ahead
of the “main signal” and their period and amplitude, measured at a ﬁxed point, increase in time.
For larger depths, low frequency “precursors” follow the main signal with decreasing period and
amplitude. These behaviors are understood in the framework of the analysis ﬁrst introduced for
linear transient electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium by Sommerfeld and Brillouin [1].

PACS numbers: 47.35.+i,11.55.Fv,68.03.Cd, 92.10.Hm

One feature of linear wave propagation in a dispersive
medium is the existence of precursors (or forerunners).
This terminology traces back to the fact that they gen-
erally arrive sooner than the “main” signal. This tran-
sient response is due to the propagation of the fastest
high frequency components of the initial spectrum. Al-
though predicted as early as 1914 by Sommerfeld and
Brillouin [1], experimental observations of forerunners
are very few and only qualitative, mainly dealing with
electromagnetic (e.m.) waves in dielectric medium in
the microwave [2] or optical [3] frequency range. Such
Sommerfeld forerunners have also been predicted in vari-
ous dispersive media such biological [4] or viscoelastic [5]
ones, and have been recently shown to be linked to the
non violation of Einstein causality during superluminal
light pulse propagation in the region of anomalous disper-
sion [6]. However, for waves in ﬂuids, the observation of
forerunners is still lacking despite some eﬀort performed
with acoustic waves in superﬂuid 3He [7] or with pressure
waves in ﬂuid-ﬁlled collapsible tubes [8]. We report here
the ﬁrst observation of two types of Sommerfeld forerun-
ners, which can coexist or not, on a thin layer of mercury.
The non-monotonous dispersion relation of waves on the
surface of a ﬂuid lead to a rich variety of such transient
wave phenomena.
In the shortwavelength limit, when
capillary eﬀects are dominant (the analogue to “anoma-
lous” dispersion [9] for e.m. waves), only the fast high fre-
quency components of the initial excitation are observed
arriving before the main pulse, the so-called Sommerfeld
precursor for e.m. waves. This transient is characterized
by small amplitude and rapid oscillations (with respect
to the main signal). For longer wavelengths, when grav-
ity is no longer negligible (“normal” dispersion), a slower
low frequency precursor is also observed (no analogue
exists for e.m. waves). The forerunners are found in
good agreement with the predictions of asymptotic anal-
ysis based on the “stationary phase method”. We note

Typeset by REVTEX

that this study also allows us to connect the forerunner
concept of electromagnetic waves to the well-known hy-
drodynamic transient surface wave phenomena [10], and
their applications to submarine eruptions [11].

The experimental setup consists of a 1.5 m long hor-
izontal PMMA channel, 7 cm wide, ﬁlled with mercury
up to a height, h, where: 2 . h . 14 mm. h is mea-
sured to a precision of
0.02 mm by means of a depth
gauge using a micrometric linear positioner. The proper-
ties of the ﬂuid are, density, ρ = 13.5 103 kg/m3, dynamic
viscosity, η = 1.5 10−3 Ns/m2 [12], and surface tension
γ = 0.4 N/m [13]. Surface waves are generated by an im-
pulsional excitation provided by the horizontal motion of
a rectangular plunging PTFE wavemaker driven by an
electromagnetic vibration exciter. They are generated
10 mm inward from one end of the channel and the local
displacement of the ﬂuid in response to this excitation is
measured simultaneously by a nonintrusive inductive sen-
sor and by an optical technique [13]. The inductive sen-
sors, 3 mm in diameter, are suspended perpendicularly
to the ﬂuid surface at rest. The linear sensing range of
the sensors allows distance measurements from the sensor
head to the ﬂuid surface up to 2.5 mm with a 5 V/mm
sensitivity. An optical determination of the local slope of
the surface is also performed. Using a position sensitive
detector, we have recorded the deﬂection of a laser beam
by the surface wave; the computation of the surface el-
evation from the optical signal is in excellent agreement
with the direct inductive measurement of the shape of the
wave [see inset of Fig. 3(b-c)]. Both sensors are mounted
on a horizontal linear positioner at a distance x from the
wavemaker, 0 < x < 1.2 m. The optical and inductive
methods are complementary as the spatial resolution and
the sensitivity of the optical technique are higher, but the
inductive technique provides a direct measurement of the
surface displacement and does not require signal process-
ing. Both techniques are not limited by their response

time in the frequency range of surface waves. The choice
of mercury has been motivated by the possible use of the
inductive measurement technique and also because of its
low kinematic viscosity which is an order of magnitude
smaller than that of water, thus strongly reducing wave
dissipation. Photographs of the free-surface of mercury
are made by means of a camera mounted above the center
of the channel. A typical pattern is displayed in Fig. 1
showing the high frequency Sommerfeld precursors, SH ,
ahead of the main signal followed by low frequency ones
SL.

To understand this behavior, one can introduce the
dispersion relation for surface waves, neglecting dissipa-
tion,

Equation (2) shows that a minimum of the group velocity

exists only when 0
to a critical depth, hc. Figure 2 shows a qualitative sketch
of the wave group velocity as a function of k, for Bo above
and below 1/3. As explained hereafter, the existence of
this minimum has a strong inﬂuence on the dispersion of
an initial disturbance.

x/t] leads to solutions with wave number ks. For
h > hc (Bo < 1/3): at small t, high frequency Sommerfeld
precursors, SH, are predicted ahead of the “main signal” with
a period which increases with time (ksH decreases). When t
is large enough (x/t < √gh) SH switches to a low frequency
Sommerfeld precursor, SL, with a decreasing period (ksL in-
creases). A Brillouin precursor corresponds to a constant pe-
riod (kmin). The typical signal amplitude vs time is sketched
on the right. The case h < hc (Bo > 1/3), where only the
fast SH solution exists, is displayed in the inset.

the other components oscillate too rapidly in order to
(cid:12)
contribute. One can apply graphically this stationary
phase method to the dispersion relation of Eq. (1), as
shown in Fig. 2. At a ﬁxed point of observation x, the
main contribution to the surface deformation ζ(x, t) at
any time t results from the points on the group velocity
curve equal to x/t (see Fig. 2). For h > hc (Bo < 1/3),
three types of precursor are predicted: the fastest signal
is the high frequency Sommerfeld precursor, SH , (from
the capillary branch) ahead of the “main signal” (arriving
√gh); then, the low frequency
at t0 with velocity x/t0
Sommerfeld precursor, SL (from the gravity branch), and
ﬁnally, at tB, the so-called Brillouin precursor (minimum
of the vg(k) curve, i.e. φ′′ = 0) as deﬁned in the frame-
work of e.m. waves. For h < hc (Bo > 1/3), only the
fast SH solution exists (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2 also shows that
SH has an increasing period as time goes on (contrary to
SL), whereas the Brillouin precursor has a constant pe-

≡

riod. This rich variety of such transient waves comes
from the non-monotonous dispersion relation of Eq. (1).
Finally, returning to the general case, one can have ac-
cess to the disturbance proﬁle ζ(x, t) which is given by
the above Fourier Integral. A Taylor serie expansion of
φ(k) in the neighborhood of ks leads to [14, 15]

Thus, the shape of the precursor notably depends on
the Fourier transform of the initial disturbance, ˆζo(ks),
whereas the temporal evolution of the precursor period
depends only of the dispersion relation through φ(ks).
Therefore, the measured period can be easily compared
with the theoretical prediction, whereas the prediction of
the experimental proﬁle requires the precise knowledge of
the initial conditions. Note that, at the minimum of the
group velocity where the Brillouin precursor is predicted,
Eq. (4) is no longer valid, and the correct asymptotic be-
havior is found by keeping higher orders in the Taylor
series for φ(k) [14, 15].

We have performed an experimental study of precur-

≤
(lc = 1.74 mm), the critical case Bo = 1/3 corresponds
3 mm. A horizontal impulsion is imposed to
to hc
initiate the surface wave. In response to this initial dis-
turbance, the free-surface proﬁle is recorded at a ﬁxed
distance from the wave generator, and displayed in Fig.
3(a) for h < hc (Bo > 1/3) in Fig. 3(b) for h > hc (Bo
< 1/3). Figure 3(a) shows the high frequency Sommer-
feld precursor which propagates at least two times faster
than the main signal (t/t0 & 0.5), with an increasing
period (deﬁned as the time between two successive ex-
trema) as graphically predicted in the inset of Fig. 2.
For a deep enough ﬂuid (Bo < 1/3) this fast precursor
coexists, as shown in Fig. 3(b), with low frequency Som-
merfeld precursor which appears behind the main signal,
with a decreasing period as graphically predicted in Fig.
2. Moreover, the amplitude of the fast precursor, SH ,
is much smaller than SL (see vertical scales in Fig. 3(a-
b)). This can be understood by assuming an initial nor-
malized hump of section s, ζ0(x) = s2/(s2 + x2), whose
e−ks. e−ks being maximum
Fourier transform is ˆζ0(k)
∼
for k = 0, the precursor SL with the larger spatial scale
has the larger amplitude. For the same depth of ﬂuid as
in Fig. 3(b), Fig. 3(c) shows the proﬁle of waves after 0.6
m of propagation. The fastest precursor has disappeared,
and only the contribution due to the gravity branch, i.e.
SL, is observed. This is linked to the arguments given
above, and also to viscous dissipation. The inset of Fig.
3(b-c) shows good agreement between optical and induc-
tive measurements, except near the front wave where the
small and fast SH forerunners are not resolved by the

inductive method (see inset of Fig. 3(b)).

Finally, the period of each forerunner is measured all

The periods are displayed in Fig. 4 as a function of t0/t

to 0.02
1/3, the SH precursor period increases as the waves
Bo
propagate. For 0
Bo < 1/3, both SH and SL precur-
sors are observed, and the period of SL decreases with
time. We can map Fig. 4 on Fig. 2 with a 90o rotation
and (x/t)/√gh can then roughly be viewed as the group
velocity curve of the stationary mode ks as a function of
1/ks. Therefore, Fig. 4 shows that SH precursor veloci-
x/t > √gh), whereas SL
ties are supersonic (vg(ksH )
precursor is subsonic (vg(ksL ) < √gh). For each h, all
the data recorded at diﬀerent x, lie on a single curve pre-
dicted by Eq. (1), which is the parametric plot of 2π/ω(k)
as a function of vg(k)
dω/dk for various values of k.
Note that a Brillouin forerunner is never observed in our
experiments, and SH disappear for large h (absence of
∗
and
-marks on Fig. 4). Note also the absence of SH for
(x/t)/√gh < 1. Although they are predicted from Fig.
2, they are much smaller than SL, and thus cannot be
observed when they travel at the same velocity.

In conclusion, we have reported the observation of
Sommerfeld forerunners in the shallow water limit of sur-
face waves and found that their period is in good agree-
ment with theoretical predictions. An extension of this
work, much easier to study in the context of hydrodynam-
ics than in the one of electromagnetism, is to understand
how the dynamics of precursors are changed when the

4

main signal amplitude is increased such that nonlinear
eﬀects become important.

Abstract

Experiments on generation of 1, 2, 4, and 6 sonoluminescent bubbles in water

with an external ultrasound source in an acoustic sphere resonator with glass walls

have been carried out. Theoretical examination has shown that the observed exci-

tation frequencies could be described with a good accuracy taking into account that

the velocities and pressures of the contacting media on the external and internal

resonator surfaces are equal. The necessity of accounting for oscillations with non–

zero self–values of angular momentum operator has been shown when describing the

features of localization of several bubbles. To explain a strangely small distance be-

tween the bubbles in the case of two–bubble sonoluminescence the following possible

explanations have been proposed: a) mechanism of space splitting of a mode with a

singular angular momentum and b) mechanism of secondary excitation when one of

the bubbles is trapped into the acoustic trap created by high–frequency vibrations

arising simultaneously when the other bubble sonoluminescence occurs.

Introduction

The phenomenon of sonoluminescence – light emission by gas–vapor bubbles

under the inﬂuence of acoustic cavitation – was observed in 1930 during exam-

ination of chemical reactions initiated by ultrasound. The great interest in this

problem was aroused from the early ’90s due to discovery of the eﬀect of single bub-

ble sonoluminescence in the ﬁeld of a standing sound wave [1]. The most part of the

experimental and theoretical works on this subject are dealing with its diﬀerent as-

pects (see, for example, the reviews [2–4]). Less studied remain the processes where

several sonoluminescent bubbles are involved, particularly, their space localization

inside the acoustic resonator is insuﬃciently studied. To describe standing waves

in a glass sphere resonator, it is proposed in [2] to consider the velocity potential

value on the glass–air boundary equal to zero and the transition from liquid to glass

was neglected. The analysis of our experiments has shown, however, that within

this approximation it is impossible to explain the observed resonance frequencies

of the small number (one to six) of sonoluminescent bubbles. In addition, in our

experiments when several sonoluminescent bubbles were excited, they formed rather

stable space structures, which cannot be easily described with spherical symmetric

velocity potentials corresponding to zero orbital momentum (described in [2]). This

work describes the experiments on generation of several sonoluminescent bubbles in

a sphere resonator as well as theoretical analysis of the results obtained.

2 Experiments

Present experiments were aimed at studying special features of SBSL in acous-

tical resonators made of glass with conﬁgurations slightly diﬀerent from spherical.

2.1 Resonators

Resonator #1. Spherical chemical retort with a long narrow neck. The maximum

size of the retort was 64.5 mm, minimum one 63.0 mm; wall thickness 1.0 mm. The

neck: length 105.0 mm, external diameter 7.5 mm, internal diameter 4.5 mm.

Resonator #2. Spherical chemical retort with a spherical bottom and wider neck.

Diameter of the retort 63.0 mm, thickness of the wall 1.5 mm, diameter of the neck

Resonator #3. Thin wall retort with ellipsoid–of–revolution form, and a short neck.

Maximum and minimum retort cross sections: 62.0 and 59.0 mm. Neck: diameter

20 mm, length 30 mm.

11 mm, length 5 mm.

During the experiments Resonators #1 and #2 were supported by their necks

with the help of laboratory three–ﬁngered clamp stand. Resonator #3 was placed

into a type of a string–bag made of strong sewing suspended on a stand.

2.2 Electroacoustic transducers.

To induce the vibrations three types of hollow cylinder transducers were used.

Transducer #1. Diameters: 30/26 mm, height: 16 mm.

Transducer #2. Diameters: 18.5/16.0 mm, height: 22 mm.

Transducer #3. Diameters: 18.5/16.0 mm, height: 10 mm.

As a sensor of acoustical vibrations a self–made piezoelectric cells were used.

Resonator #1 was equipped with one activator located within the equatorial plane,

Resonator #2 was equipped with two activators located symmetrical within the

equatorial plane. Resonator #3 was equipped with one activator located at the

bottom of the retort.

2.3 Electronics

Activators were connected to the transformer output of low frequency 100 W am-

pliﬁer with 60 kHz band pass and 150 V maximum voltage. The ampliﬁer was fed

by low–frequency generator G3–110. The scheme contains also series LC circuit: L

– variable inductance of a coil with a ferrite core, C – capacitance of activator; the

circuit being tuned to one of the fundamental frequencies of a resonator.

2.4 Seeding of cavitation centers

Seeding of cavitation centers was carried out by dropping a special nail–headed rod

onto a surface of water in the base of resonator necks, or by injection of air bubbles

into the water by a microsyringe in the case of Resonator #3.

2.5 Results

In the case of Resonator #1 a satellite bubble was observed, i. e. a second lumi-

nescent bubble. Brightness of this second bubble was much less then that of the

main bubble. Satellite oscillated a little. Both bubbles located along the axis of

the neck of the retort above (the main bubble), and below (the satellite) the center

of the retort. The frequency was f = 27048 kHz, the quality factor of the system

Q = 1000.

frequency.

In Resonator #2 there were four luminescent bubbles in the vertexes of an imagi-

nary quadrant. Plane of the quadrant changed a position a little depending on the

In Resonator #3, a stable luminescence took place concurrently for six bubbles,

alternately fading and arising again in diﬀerent positions. The frequency was

f = 53840 kHz (the second harmonic), the quality factor Q = 234.

where c and c′ are sound velocity in water and in glass, respectively, and α is a phase

zero (we neglect wave radiation into environment) gives

where a+ ≡ a + d is an external radius of the ﬂask and d is the wall thickness. From

here we have

n = 0, 1, 2, ...

Further we will assume that n = 1 (it appeared that this very n value agrees with

the experiment), which corresponds to the solution

We will describe wave reﬂection on the water–glass boundary accounting for the

sides of the boundary [6]. The last condition gives

The requirement of medium continuity on the surface r = a is reduced to the equality

where c/c ′ ≃ 0.25 ÷ 0.3 and ρ/ρ ′ ≃ 0.4 are the ratios of sound velocities and

material densities of water and glass. First solution (5) with a minimum value

of wave number k corresponds to ka ≃ 3.685, which, for example, for a = 3.15

corresponds to the glass thickness d ≃ 2.6 mm, which is rather close to a real one.

Acoustic oscillation frequency is connected with the wave vector k by the relation

f = ck/2π, which also gives a value close to the observed f ≃ 27 KHz.

According to the existing theory which is in a good agreement with the ex-

periment, cavitation bubbles are located, depending on their size, either in nodes,

or in points of local maximum of pressure amplitude in standing acoustic wave

(anti–nodes). Thus, small–size bubbles (smaller than a certain resonance value) are

located in nodes, while big ones – in points of maximum [7]. Experiments with

several sonoluminescent bubbles have shown that in this sense they are “big” since

they are located in anti–nodes [2].

Equation (5) allows one to identify the experimentally observed bubble trapping

at a center of water–ﬁlled glass ﬂasks with outer radiuses a+, equal to 3.15 and

3.20 cm, at excitation frequencies 27 and 26.5 KHz, respectively, as their trapping

by the acoustic traps corresponding to the solutions (5) with minimum values of

wave number k i.e., with a ﬁrst harmonics of the resonator self–oscillations). At

the same time, the bubble observed at the frequency of 53.82 KHz at the center

of the water–ﬁlled glass ﬂask at a+ = 3.025 ± 0.075 cm, can be corresponded with

the second harmonics. Single sonoluminescent bubbles corresponding to third and

higher harmonics have not been studied in these experiments.

Excitation of two, four, and six

Since at acoustic wave excitation under real conditions the spherical symmetry

condition is violated surface excitations in the ﬂask should be described with the

following function:

rs(θ, ϕ, t) = R(t) +

alm(t)Ylm(θ, ϕ),

Xl,m

where Ylm are spherical functions accounting for the dependence of surface defor-

mations on θ and ϕ angular coordinates. Then the wave equation for the potential

potential form corresponds to l = 1. Similarly the velocity potentials, corresponding

to the higher angular momentums, are interpreted.

The points of pressure extremals location showing bubble position in the res-

onator, are described with a system of equations

(10)

The velocity potential ψ at a preset excitation frequency fkl is, generally speaking,

a superposition of functions (8) with diﬀerent values of m projections of angular

momentum, m = −l, ..., +l. In the case of frequency degeneration (within the ∆f

width determined by the system q–factor by l parameter , it is necessary as well

to take into account the superpositions of the states with diﬀerent values of orbital

The obtained angular coordinates correspond to the experimentally observed at the

frequency f ≃ 49.5 KHz four–bubble conﬁguration located in the ﬂask with the

radius a+ = 3.2 at the vertexes of an imaginary square.

If for the approximate estimate of probable distances from the bubbles to the

center of the ﬂask according to [2], we take soft conditions at the external boundary

p|r=a+ = −ρ

|r=a+ = 0,

where ψ is the velocity potential of acoustic oscillations in liquid, then, accounting

for the explicit expression for Rk1, we obtain the equation

tg ka+ = ka+,

the solutions of which are

ka+ ≃

4.4934,

7.7253,

10.9041

etc.

Taking into account that k = 2πf /c ≃ 2.075 cm−1, we ﬁnd that only the ﬁrst

of these solutions corresponds to the experimentally observed excitation frequency.

Probable positions of the bubbles ri, are determined from the condition

which leads to the equation

tg kri =

It can be seen that the ﬁrst of the solutions

kri ≃

7.7253

etc. ,

of this equation with the account of k value gives

r1 ≃ 2.2 cm,

which is somewhat greater than the experimentally observed value rexp ≃ 1.5 cm.

This shows that the speculations of the previous section, accounting not only for the

external boundary conditions but for the water–glass interface conditions as well,

should be true for the case of various sonoluminescent bubbles (for each of the radial

functions Rkl).

It would be natural to take as a potential a combination of states corresponding

to l = 2 for the six–bubble conﬁguration observed at a frequency of f ≃ 53.8 KHz

located in the ﬂask at the same plane approximately one centimeter from the glass

wall. In this case the solution of system (11) for angular coordinates gives

for Y2,±2. On the assumption that not all of the bubble traps were ﬁlled up

(though no special measures had been undertaken for this purpose), among the

solutions obtained one could ﬁnd the sets similar to the experimentally observed

conﬁguration. It is especially interesting to analyze a two-bubble conﬁguration lo-

cated along the vertical line near the center of the ﬂask (with a radius a+ = 3.15

cm) at f ≃ 26.9603 KHz, frequency where one of the bubbles was emitting light

more intensely than the other. The distance between them is unexpectedly small

(only few millimeters), which is diﬃcult to explain with the use of equation (11) for
a radical part of the potential2. One of the possible explanations of this fact is that
2Small distances of bubbles from the center of the ﬂask correspond to large values of the wave

number. In this case, however, k = 1.13 cm−1.

10

in this case one of the bubbles was trapped by an acoustic trap created by the high–

frequency pulsations of the other arising simultaneously with its sonoluminescence.

It is well known that the wave length of these high–frequency oscillations is approx-

imately 20 times smaller than the standing wave length exciting sonoluminescence

[2], and in our case is within the millimeter range. If the ﬂask had the shape of a

spheroid with a small distance between the focuses and if one of the bubbles was

located at one of the focuses, then the emitted by it high–frequency waves should

be accumulated at the other focus [11] thus creating an acoustic trap capable of

supporting sonoluminescence of another bubble. The other possible explanation of

these results is connected with formula (9), which shows that the solutions corre-

sponding to l = 1, and the conﬁguration of two bubbles, located at a ﬁnite though

small distance between each other, are close. The transition of the common solution

with l = 1 into the conﬁguration of two bubbles oscillating in anti–phase is possible

on the assumption of a certain instability connected with excitation of vertical oscil-

lations due either to the fact that the ﬂask has a neck, or to periodic deformations

of the surface of the ﬂask by the attached piezoelectric transducer . At present this

problem remains open.

5 Conclusion

This paper describes an experimental setup permitting to study the processes of

single– or several–bubble sonoluminescence in a sphere resonator. Though seemingly

simple, an experiment of this kind is not a trivial task and it requires a number of

conditions (such as ﬁne tuning of the excitation frequency, requirements to the

resonator Q–factor, temperature, and pressure in cavitating liquid, etc.). At the

same time it is very important to study these processes if regarded that at present no

generally accepted theory exists explaining the nature of the observed light emission

[2, 4], and also because recently the chances appeared to attain extremely high

temperature and pressures in these processes [2, 9, 10]. Therefore, it is clear that the

precise description of the conditions under which stable laboratory reproducibility

of these phenomena is possible is of much importance.

11

The analysis performed in this paper has shown that when calculating resonant

excitation frequencies, at which one could expect sonoluminescent bubble arising,

boundary conditions should be accounted for not only at the external but at the

internal side of the resonator wall as well.

In the case of several bubbles excita-

tion, radial oscillation modes with diﬀerent from zero orbital momentum should be

accounted for. Further, to check the correctness of the proposed description one

should have the precise measurements of bubble position in the resonator with the

account of optical distortions due to light passing through the water–ﬁlled glass

ﬂask. It seems important as well to study the reason of the anomalous approach of

two sonoluminescent bubbles.

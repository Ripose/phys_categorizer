Cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries solitons on a ferroﬂuid surface

Dirk Rannacher∗ and Andreas Engel
Universit¨at Oldenburg, Institut f¨ur Theoretische Physik, 26111 Oldenburg, Germany
(Dated: February 17, 2014)

Linear and non-linear surface waves on a ferroﬂuid cylinder surrounding a current-carrying wire
are investigated. Suppressing the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of the ﬂuid column by the magnetic
ﬁeld of a suﬃciently large current in the wire axis-symmetric surface deformations are shown to
propagate without dispersion in the long wavelength limit. Using multiple scale perturbation theory
the weakly non-linear regime may be described by a Korteweg-de Vries equation with coeﬃcients
depending on the magnetic ﬁeld strength. For diﬀerent values for the current in the wire hence
diﬀerent solutions such as hump or hole solitons may be generated. The possibility to observe these
structures in experiments is also elucidated.

INTRODUCTION

Solitons are among the most interesting structures in
nature. Being conﬁgurations of continuous ﬁelds they
retain their localized shape even after interactions and
collisions. Observed originally long ago as stable moving
humps in shallow water channels [1] they have been es-
tablished since then in various physical systems including
optical waveguides, crystal lattices, Josephson junctions,
plasmas and spiral galaxies (for an introduction see [2]).
Long lasting eﬀorts to theoretically describe their intrigu-
ing properties have culminated in the development of the
inverse scattering technique [3] which is among the most
powerful methods to obtain exact solutions of nonlinear
partial diﬀerential equations [4].

Particularly popular examples for solitons in hydrody-
namic systems are the solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries
equation (KdV)

∂tu(x, t) + 6u(x, t)∂xu(x, t) + ∂3

xu(x, t) = 0 ,

(1)

with x standing for a space coordinate and t denoting
time. With u representing the surface elevation of a liq-
uid in a shallow duct this equation can be derived per-
turbatively from the Euler equation for the motion of an
incompressible and inviscid ﬂuid [5, 6]. The one soliton
solution of (1) is given by

which for all values of c > 0 describes a hump of in-
variable shape moving to the right with velocity c. The
amplitude of the hump is given by c/2 whereas L = 2/√c
is a measure of its width.

A decisive prerequisite to derive (1) is that to linear
order in the ﬁeld u the system under consideration admits
travelling waves u

where c0 denotes the phase velocity. Intuitively the in-
variant shape of the soliton solution may then be under-
stood as the consequence of a delicate balance between
nonlinearity and dispersion at higher orders of both u
and k [2].

In the present paper we investigate cylindrical soli-
tons of KdV-type on the surface of a ferroﬂuid in the
magnetic ﬁeld of a current-conducting wire. Ferroﬂu-
ids are stable suspensions of ferromagnetic nano-particles
in Newtonian liquids and behave superparamagnetically
in external magnetic ﬁelds [15].
In the standard setup
of a horizontal layer of ferroﬂuid subject to a homoge-
neous magnetic ﬁeld an additional term proportional to
k2 shows up in the dispersion relation (3) [10] which in-
hibits the derivation of a KdV equation in this geome-
try. On the other hand, for a ferroﬂuid cylinder in the
magnetic ﬁeld of a current-carrying wire surrounded by a
non-magnetic liquid of equal density the magnetic force
may replace gravity and allows for dispersion free surface
waves in the long wavelength limit. This in turn paves
the way to derive a KdV equation for axis-symmetric
surface deformations on the ferroﬂuid cylinder [11, 12].

Due to surface tension a long ﬂuid cylinder is unsta-
ble to surface modulations resulting eventually in discon-
nected drops (Rayleigh-Plateau instability). Before em-
barking on he study of travelling waves on the ﬂuid sur-
face therefore means have to be found to suppress this
instability. Fortunately, this can also be accomplished
with the help of the magnetic ﬁeld [15].

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we col-
lect the basic equations and boundary conditions. Sec-
tion 3 is devoted to a linear stability analysis of a cylin-
der of ferroﬂuid in the magnetic ﬁeld of a current-carrying
wire. Here we demonstrate the possibility to suppress the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability and establish the dispersion
relation (3) for axissymmetric surface waves. In section
4 we derive the KdV equation by multiple scale pertur-
bation theory with details of the calculation relegated
to two appendices. Section 5 provides the explicit form
of the one and two soliton solution of the system and
also discusses the accessibility of these solutions in ex-
periments. Finally, section 6 contains some conclusions.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

The magnetic ﬁeld has to obey the magnetostatic

Maxwell equations [15]

We consider a cylindrical column of ferroﬂuid sur-
rounding a straight, thin, long, current-carrying wire un-
der zero gravity. The ferroﬂuid is modelled as an in-
compressible, inviscid liquid of density ρ and constant
magnetic susceptibility χ. We use cylindrical coordi-
nates (r, θ, z), with the z-axis pointing along the wire
(see Fig.1). The magnetic ﬁeld is given by

eθ ,

H =

J
2πr
where J denotes the current through the wire. Due to the
ﬁeld a magnetization M = χH builds up in the ferroﬂuid.
The corresponding magnetic force, Fm = µ0(M

tracts the ferroﬂuid radially inward. The equilibrium

the radius denoted by R. Deviations from this shape
are parametrized by a function ζ(z, θ, t) according to
r = R + ζ(z, θ, t).

In this section we study the linear stability of the
cylindrical interface given by ζ
0 , Ψ1 =
Ψ2 = θ. To this end we introduce small perturbations
ζ(θ, z, t), φ(r, θ, z, t), ψ1(r, θ, z, t), and ψ2(r, θ, z, t) of the
surface proﬁle, velocity potential and magnetic potentials
respectively and linearize the basic equations and their
boundary conditions in these perturbations. From the
translational invariance along the z-axis and eqs.(9) and
(13) together with the boundary conditions (14) and (18)
it follows that these perturbations are of the form

ζ(θ, z, t) = Cn exp(inθ + ikz + pt)

φ(r, θ, z, t) = DnIn(kr) exp(inθ + ikz + pt)
ψ1(r, θ, z, t) = AnIn(kr) exp(inθ + ikz + pt)
ψ2(r, θ, z, t) = BnKn(kr) exp(inθ + ikz + pt) .

Here k denotes the wave number in z-direction, n
characterizes the azimuthal modulations, and p is the

their dependence on k and p suppressed) and In(k) and
Kn(k) denote modiﬁed Bessel functions of order n [16].
Using the linearization of (19) we may express An and

The reference state of a cylindrical column becomes un-
stable if combinations of k, n and Bo exist for which pn
is positive.

(cid:1)

For Bo = 0 we ﬁnd back the well-known Rayleigh-
Plateau instability accomplished by radially symmetric
modes with n = 0. Modes with higher values of n are
not able to destabilize the ﬂuid cylinder.

Since one has for all k

we infer from (30) that p2
n(k) is a monotonically decreas-
ing function of the magnetic Bond number Bo. The mag-
netic ﬁeld hence always stabilizes the cylindrical surface.
Consequently it may change the qualitative behaviour of
the system only due to its inﬂuence on the n = 0 modes.

tion of the region around k = 0. For Bo > 1 one has p2 < 0
for all k and no instability occurs.

(32) we see that the Rayleigh-Plateau instability for a fer-
roﬂuid column will be suppressed by a suﬃciently strong

magnetic ﬁeld fulﬁlling Bo > 1 [13]. Using typical pa-
rameter values as χ = 1.2, σ = 0.03 J/m2 and a ﬂuid
radius of R = 1 cm the system remains stable if the cur-
rent exceeds the threshold Jc

In this section we show that it is indeed possible to
derive a KdV equation for the surface deﬂection ζ(z, t)
[11] by using a multiple scale perturbation theory similar
to the case of rectangular geometry. To this end we ﬁrst
observe that for an axis symmetric free surface the mag-
netic ﬁeld problem decouples from the hydrodynamics
and we have the exact result

Ψ1 = θ .

(41)

Ψ1 = (0, 1/r, 0) and therefore
This in turn implies

Ψ1 = 0. Using moreover the explicit expression for
n in terms of ζ(z, t) resulting from (17) we get from (22)

In the previous section we have seen that the system
under consideration admits to linear order in the sur-
face deﬂection ζ cylindrical, axis symmetric surface waves
with no dispersion in the long wavelength limit k
0.
From the experience with plane surface waves on shal-
low water [6] it is hence tempting to investigate whether
at higher orders in k and ζ nonlinear waves may be ob-
tained for which the eﬀects of nonlinearity and dispersion
exactly balance each other. This could then give rise to

To get a suitable expansion for the velocity potential Φ we
note that from the Laplace equation (9) and the bound-
ary condition (14) one may derive the following represen-

where c
1 is a free constant having the same sign as
c2. For Bo < 9 we have hence c < 0 and the soliton
has a slightly smaller velocity than the linear waves. If
Bo < 3/2 also c1 < 0 and therefore the amplitude of
the soliton is positive, i.e. we have a hump soliton as
shown in Fig. 3a. For 3/2 < Bo < 9 on the other hand
c1 > 0 and consequently (61) describes a depression or
hole soliton as depicted in Fig. 3b. Finally, for Bo > 9
we have c2 > 0, hence c > 0, and also c1 > 0. The soliton
amplitude is therefore positive again and its velocity is
now slightly larger than that of the corresponding linear
waves.

To get some impression of the accessibility of the solu-
tion in experiments the results for the following param-
eter sets may be helpful. For a ferroﬂuid with χ = 1.2,
ρ = 1.12 g/cm3 and σ = 0.03 J/m2 forming a cylinder
of radius R = 1 cm a current I = 100 A corresponds to
Bo
1.27. A soliton with amplitude A = 2 mm has
then a velocity of U = 1.8 cm/s and the width of the
hump is about L = 20 cm. This soliton will hence be
diﬃcult to observe in an experiment. For a current of
I = 294 A corresponding to Bo
11 the extension re-
duces for the same amplitude to L =1.6 cm with the
velocity increasing to U = 2.2 cm/s. A hole-soliton with
amplitude A =
2 mm, velocity U = 8.4 cm/s, and width
L = 2.1 cm can be realized with a current of I = 235 A
corresponding to Bo
7. The latter two solitons are
shown schematically in Fig. 3. Both should be easily
observable experimentally.

A two soliton solution may be derived using, e.g., Hi-
rotha’s method [14]. Depending on the value of the mag-
netic bond number one may combine either two hump
or two hole solitons. The case of two hump solitons is

A snapshot of the solution is displayed in Fig. 4, its
time evolution is characterized by Fig. 5. The main fea-
ture is the passing of the slower soliton by the faster one.
After the interaction process the two solitons reemerge
undisturbed which is the deﬁning property of a soliton
solution.

VI. CONCLUSION

In the present paper we have investigated nonlinear
waves on the cylindrical surface of a ferroﬂuid surround-
ing a current-carrying wire under zero gravity. We have
shown that for a suﬃciently large current a Korteweg-
de Vries equation for axissymmetric surface distortion
can be derived. Accordingly the system under considera-

tion is well suited to experimentally investigate cylindri-
cal solitons of KdV type.

In order to observe these solitons ﬁrst of all the ubiq-
uitous Rayleigh-Plateau instability has to be suppressed.
This can be accomplished by the magnetic ﬁeld if the
current exceeds a critical value which for experimentally
relevant parameters is of about 100 A.

We have shown that non axis-symmetric perturbations

deformations of the rings. As we have shown in the
present paper the somewhat unrealistic properties of the
elastic rings can be mimicked by a cylindrical magnetic
ﬁeld if the ﬂuid to be conﬁned is a ferroﬂuid.

same as in Fig. 4

of the surface always disperse whereas axis-symmetric
ones propagate almost dispersion-free if the wavelength
is very large. Using the fact that for axis-symmetric
surface deﬂections the magnetic ﬁeld problem decouples
completely from the hydrodynamic part a Korteweg-de
Vries equation can be derived. The parameters in this
equation depend on the magnetic ﬁeld strength which
gives rise to qualitatively diﬀerent soliton solutions like
hump and hole solutions for diﬀerent values of the cur-
rent in the wire. The one and two soliton solutions were
discussed in detail and conditions for their experimental
realization were given.

It should be noted that our theoretical analysis is per-
turbative and therefore approximate as is typical for the
treatment of solitons in hydrodynamic systems. More-
over, for reasons of simplicity we have not taken into
account the inﬂuence of the surrounding non-magnetic
liquid necessary to ensure zero gravity. Additionally vis-
cosity was neglected throughout the analysis since the
Korteweg-de Vries equation results from the Euler equa-
tion describing inviscid ﬂuids.
In experiments one will
hence always see a damping of the soliton solutions with
time due to dissipation by viscous shear ﬂow. It is an
attractive idea to counter-balance these viscous losses
by appropriately chosen time dependent magnetic ﬁelds,
however we were not able to ﬁnd a suitable geometry for
this idea to become operative. In any case a theoretical
analysis aiming at this goal has to go beyond the quasi-
static version of ferro-hydrodynamics employed in the
present analysis and has to include magneto-dissipative
couplings, see e.g. [17].

We ﬁnally note that our system is an experimentally
accessible realization of the introductory example for a
soliton given in chapter 1.4 of the book by Lamb [18].
There an incompressible ﬂuid inside a cylinder made of
independent elastic rings is considered. The rings are
supposed to deform axis-symmetrically in reaction to
the ﬂuid pressure, however although conﬁning the liquid
tightly they must be uncoupled in order not to sustain
elastic waves by themselves. Gravity is neglected alto-
gether. Using the conservation of mass and momentum
of the ﬂuid and linear elasticity for the rings it is then
possible to derive a KdV equation for axis-symmetric

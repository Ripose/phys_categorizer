It is generally agreed that the Hilbert–Chapman–Enskog expansion of the kinetic
equations in mean ﬂight times is asymptotic rather than convergent. It is therefore
inadvisable to use lower order results to simplify the current approximation as is done
in the traditional Chapman–Enskog procedure, since that is an iterative method.
By avoiding such recycling of lower order results, one obtains macroscopic equations
that are asymptotically equivalent to the ones obtained in the Chapman–Enskog
approach but that contain undiscarded higher order terms that make a signiﬁcant
impact on the results for such problems as ultrasound propagation. In this paper, it
is shown that these results turn out well with relatively little complication when the
expansions are carried to second order in the mean free time, for the example of the
relaxation or BGK model of kinetic theory.

INTRODUCTION

Derivations of the dynamical equations for a continuum under the inﬂuence of internal
friction were ﬁrst produced in the nineteenth century by phenomenological arguments in
the works of Navier, Poisson and Stokes. These “Navier–Stokes” equations contained co-
eﬃcients of viscosity and heat conduction whose evaluation was not provided by the early
phenomenology. It was not until Maxwell’s treatment of the problem through elementary
kinetic theory that the dependences of these coeﬃcients on the thermodynamical state vari-
ables began to be understood. When the need for a kinetic theoretical underpinning of
the theory of the dissipative properties of ﬂuids had become clearer, Hilbert [1] developed
approximate solutions of Boltzmann’s basic kinetic equation in terms of an expansion in the
mean ﬂight time of the particles constituting the ﬂuid. Finally, in the hands of Chapman
and of Enskog, the derivation of the equations of ﬂuid dynamics from the basic kinetic the-
ory of gases took on the form that was most widely used throughout the last century. This
theory, in the formal version that Enskog developed, was summarized authoritatively in the
book of Chapman and Cowling [2], as well as by a number of later books [3–6].

Though it was satisfying that the same equations came from phenomenology as from
kinetic theory, there was also bad news: when the mean ﬂight time is long, the descriptions
of sound propagation and of shock wave structure from the Navier–Stokes equations are
not very good when compared to experiment [3]. This is one of the reasons that other
approaches to the derivation of ﬂuid dynamical theory have been sought over the years. The
ﬁrst approach was naturally to extend the Hilbert development to higher order. This was
achieved by Burnett [7], who went to second and third order in the expansions. However the
form of Burnett’s equations that are conventionally employed are those that result when the
Euler equations have been introduced into them by Chapman and Cowling [2] as Agarwal
et al. [8] have discussed. This may be the reason for the disappointing result that little
or no improvement was found (and with often unphysical consequences) when the reduced
Burnett equations were used for situations when the mean ﬂight time was not extremely
small. The reason that going to higher order does not lead to any real improvement in
the results obtained with the Chapman–Enskog approach is probably that, as Grad [9] and
Uhlenbeck and Ford [3] have pointed out, the Hilbert expansion is asymptotic rather than
convergent. Since the Chapman–Enskog procedure is a sort of iteration process, it would
seem to be inappropriate for a series that is not convergent. That is, in the Chapman–Enskog
procedure, one uses results from the previous order to simplify the results in the current
order and this has the eﬀect of restricting the domain of validity of the approximation at
any order.

To circumvent this limitation of the Chapman–Enskog procedure, an alternate approach
was suggested in which the recycling of lower order results was avoided [10–13].
In the
case of the relaxation model of kinetic theory [14, 15] this extension of the procedures was
straightforward to apply and the results were encouraging. (The alternate approach was also
carried out to ﬁrst order for a Fokker–Planck type collision operator in Ref. [16].) Not only
was an improved description of the structures of shock waves over that from the Navier–
Stokes equations obtained, but also the phase speed of sound waves that emerged was in
good agreement with experiment for all ratios of mean ﬂight times to wave periods, unlike
the Navier–Stokes results. Though the results for damping of sound waves did not turn
out as well, they were not bad for mean ﬂight times below the sound period and they were
better than the Navier–Stokes results. At present though, it is unclear whether a continuum
theory can do much better than this result for damping. Perhaps a microscopic theory is
required to do better, as Stubbe [17] and Sukhorukov and Stubbe [18, 19] suggest. Here we
further probe the continuum theory by going to higher order using the new approach.

II. BASICS

We consider a gas of N identical particles of mass m whose individual positions and
velocities are denoted by x and v. The distribution of the paricles in the phase space with
coordinates xi and vj (i, j = 1, 2, 3) is represented by a swarm of representative points whose
local density f (x, v, t) is deﬁned such that the probable number of particles in the volume
element dx dv is f (x, v, t) dx dv.

The ﬂuid dynamical variables are deﬁned in terms of moments of f . The density and

ﬂuid velocity are

ρ :=

mf dv

and

u :=

mv f dv

(1)

Z

ρ Z

and, with the peculiar velocity c := v

u, we may deﬁne the temperature

−

T :=

3R ρ Z

c2f d3v .

We seek equations for these quantities. Interest has been focused on them because, as van
Kampen [20] has stressed, these are the macroscopic “slow variables” that emerge from
Boltzmann’s theory.

The particles satisfy Hamiltonian dynamics and so the phase ﬂuid ﬂows incompressibly

and satisﬁes an equation of the form

Df = α

βf

−

where

D := ∂t + vi∂i + aj∂vj
and summation over repeated symbols is understood throughout this work. The quantity a
is the imposed external force per unit mass.

(4)

On the left of (3), we have the rate of change of f resulting from the streaming of the
representative points through phase space. On the right, we see the eﬀects of the interactions
of the particles with those in their surroundings. Particles with velocity equal to v have
their velocities changed to some other values at a rate βf per unit volume while particles
with other velocites are given the velocity v at the rate α. In strict equilibrium, f has the
value f0, which does not depend on x or t. Then the left side of (3) vanishes and we ﬁnd
that

f0 = α/β.

(5)

This expression recalls the Kirchhoﬀ–Planck law of radiation theory and hints that radiative
transfer theory is one source of inspiration for the relaxation model [21].

According to the description we adopt of the way the particles interact with each other,
we may ﬁnd f0 either as a consequence of the vanishing of the interaction term or we may
need to prescribe it. In either case, the choice of greatest interest is the Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution

f0(x, v, t) =

(2πRT )3/2 exp
where n := ρ/m. In the case where the ﬂuid variables are allowed to depend on space and
time, the use of the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for f0 deﬁnes a local thermodynamic
equilbirium. When we introduce (5)–(6) into the kinetic equation, with the understanding
that f0 represents only a local equilibrium, we get the relaxation model

where τ := 1/β. We may then study the case of nonequilibrium, with f and f0 diﬀering,
by using the kinetic equation to follow the evolution of f . Alternatively, we may seek the
coarser description of ﬂuid dynamics in terms of the moments of the kinetic equation.

Given the deﬁnitions of the ﬂuid variables and the expression of f0 in terms of them,
we obtain consistency between the two by imposing the matching conditions [22, pp. 362
and 369],

with µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and i = 1, 2, 3. This ensures that the state variables in f0 are the same
ones that are given by the moments of f . Since we shall assume here that τ does not depend
explicitly on v, though it may depend on the state variables, the matching conditions are
equivalent to the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.

If we now multiply the kinetic equation by ψµ and integrate over velocity space, we obtain

that its trace is 3p where

To obtain determinate expressions for P and Q, we seek an approximation for f . In what
follows we describe a procedure for obtaining and using one. We begin with a standard
expansion of f in terms of τ :

f = f0 + f1 τ + f2 τ 2 + . . . .

tions written as P(i) and Q(i) which lead to

P = P(0) + P(1) + . . .

and

Q = Q(0) + Q(1) + . . . .

(20)

At the lowest order, in which f0 is the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, we ﬁnd that

P(0) = p I and Q(0) = 0, and so we have (10) and

Without the O (τ ) terms, these are the Euler equations.

At the next order, we obtain the ﬂuid equations found earlier [10, 11]; these reduce to
the standard Navier–Stokes equations when τ becomes strictly inﬁnitesimal. As these ﬁrst-
order developments are central to the current work we present them next (Section III). This
provides us with an opportunity to describe how the Navier–Stokes equations emerge and to
indicate how the Lorentz force enters the theory when electromagnetic eﬀects are considered.
Then we proceed to carry the development on to the next order (Section IV) and to show the
predictions of the second order theory for the propagation of free sound waves (Section V).

C. The Prandtl Number

The relaxation model is prone to some ambiguity coming from the the lack of speciﬁcity
in the details of the interactions of particles. In particular, the model leaves open the way τ
depends on v. This is really a matter that is related to the nature of the atomic interactions
and does not seem to have a signiﬁcant qualitative inﬂuence on the macroscopic results.

However, the Prandtl number, σ, given by the relaxation model is diﬀerent from that pre-
dicted by the Boltzmann model which is restricted to two-body interactions. (The Prandtl
number is the ratio of the viscosity times Cp to the thermal conductivity.) Experiments in
noble gases give values for σ close to 2/3, the value predicted by the Boltzmann equation
for a gas of hard spheres; by contrast, the value of unity is found with the relaxation model.
In calculating macroscopic quantities with the relaxation model, notably the stress tensor
and energy ﬂux, it is sometimes considered desirable to adjust the value of σ in the results
to be 2/3. Since there is more than one way to do this, a systematic procedure seems called
for, particularly in situations where the Lorentz force comes into play, where the ambiguity
is worse.

Woods [23] has given a prescription for introducing the desired value of the Prandtl
number that seems to work well, though it is more of a rule of thumb than a fully justiﬁed
procedure. It has the advantage of providing a deﬁnite prescription that can be carried into
higher order and it leads to agreement with results from the Boltzmann equation for all of
the numerical coeﬃcients that appear in the higher moments obtained from the Chapman–
Enskog procedure in second order in τ . Since this modiﬁcation of the results can be retracted
by setting σ = 1, it is harmless and we shall introduce it.

In Woods’ approach one introduces the Prandtl number into the formulae for approxi-
mating f rather than into the ﬁnal ﬂuid equations. The motivation for Woods’ procedure
is that the times of relaxation for momentum and energy are a little diﬀerent [24] so that
he has suggested the use of diﬀerent relaxation times depending on whether a term from f
enters the pressure tensor or the heat ﬂux. Terms with even powers in c contribute to the
pressure tensor and are assigned a relaxation time τ ; terms with odd powers in c contribute
to the heat ﬂux and are assigned a relaxation time τ /σ where σ is the Prandtl number.
Therefore, rewrite (36) as

(37)

This way of adjusting the Prandtl number diﬀers from that in the ﬁrst-order derivation
of Refs. [10, 11] and, for σ = 2/3, it leads to agreement of our second-order theory with
Burnett’s results [7] from the Boltzmann equation if we discard terms of order τ 3 (see the
appendix).

If the acceleration a is not a function of v, Eq. (37) is cubic in ci, so ˆf1 is a polynomial in c.
If a is a polynomial in v, then we can still write ˆf1 as a polynomial in c, possibly of higher
order than cubic. An interesting instance of this arises when a includes the Lorentz force
on charged particles. The only term in (37) that involves a is Ψ. That term vanishes for
the standard Chapman–Enskog expansion without the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld H.
When E and H are included, Ψ is nonzero and can depend on velocity through a [Eq. (33)].
Let

a(x, v, t) =

[E(x, t) + v

H(x, t)]

×

e

be the acceleration due to the Lorenz force, where e is the electron charge in MKS units.
By rewriting a as

H(x, t) .

we split the acceleration into a part that is independent of c and a part linear in c. As we
H will not contribute. Hence, electric

which is independent of v.

D. Matching Conditions

Although the relaxation model is often regarded as linear, in much the same way that the
analogous equation of radiative transfer is, it has to be recognized that f0 depends on the
moments of the full f and so cannot be considered as given a priori . Treating the problem
as formally linear is possible because the feedback on the ﬂuid variables from alterations in
f are forced to be consistent with the basic equations by the matching conditions (8). In
the present work, they guarantee the conservation of the collisional invariants ψµ.

If we insert the solution (37) for f1 into (8) we ﬁnd that the density matching condition

is satisﬁed to this order. The momentum matching condition is that

mv f1 d3v =

But P(0) = p I so that P
p I = O (τ ). Hence, the momentum matching condition is satisﬁed
to the order of the current approximation, which is all that can be asked in an asymptotic
development.

Similarly, the energy matching condition is that

On recalling that Q(0) = 0, we see that Σ is O (τ ). We thus conclude that all the matching
conditions are satisﬁed to the required order.

E. Pressure Tensor and Heat Flux

As mentioned in Section III, if the acceleration a does not depend on v (except possibly
for a magnetic term) and τ does not depend on v, then we can write ˆf1 as a third degree
polynomial in the components of v . Finding the contributions of the ﬁrst-order terms in f
to the pressure tensor and heat ﬂux is then just a matter of inserting the solution (37) for ˆf1
(times τ ) into (13) and carrying out the resulting integrals, as indicated by (20). We ﬁnd

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

where we have written Cp for 5R/2. The Prandtl number is σ = µ Cp/η.

The ﬁrst terms in each of the expressions (44) are those that appear in Navier–Stokes
equations. The second terms (proportional to Σ and Ψ) are the terms that are retained when
the additional approximations introduced in the usual Chapman–Enskog procedure are not
made. That is, if we had used the zeroth order results (the Euler equations) to eliminate the
time derivatives contained in Σ and Ψ, we would have obtained the Navier–Stokes equations,
as in the Chapman–Enskog method, though generally speaking this extra (and unnecessary)
step is normally taken earlier in the development in the standard approach. Our suggestion
is that if one wants to simplify the expressions for P(1) and Q(1) by eliminating the time
derivatives, it is more accurate to use the current approximation for the equations of motion
rather than a lower order one.
If this elimination is done iteratively, it shows that our
expressions for the higher moments contain terms of all orders in τ . However, we have left
the time derivatives as they appear in Σ and Ψ [Eqs. (32) and (33)], and we shall simply work
with the full system self-consistently when we illustrate a physical problem in Section V. We
note in passing that the Prandtl number appears here in diﬀerent terms in the stress tensor
and energy ﬂux than in Refs. [10, 11] as a result of our having used Woods’ prescription
(Section (III C)).

The stress tensor and energy ﬂux at this stage are written as

P = P(0) + P(1) + O

τ 2

and

Q = Q(0) + Q(1) + O

τ 2

(46)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where P(0) = p I and Q(0) = 0. Since the terms by which P(1) and Q(1) diﬀer from the
corresponding Navier–Stokes expressions are O (τ 2), the diﬀerences are within the allowed
error estimates for both treatments. By the same token, we ﬁnd directly from the deﬁnition
of P that its trace is 3p while the trace of our expression for it diﬀers from 3p by terms of
order τ 2. This is also compatible with the asymptotics to this order. As we shall see, in the
next order, the trace of our approximation to P diﬀers from 3p only by terms of order τ 3.

A suggestive way look at these results is to observe that we may write

Solving for ˆf2 is now a matter of collecting the terms of (55), (54) and (64). We then follow
the same prescription as in Section III and assign a relaxation time τ to the terms in ˆf2 even
in c, and τ /σ to the odd terms, to account for the diﬀerent relaxation rates of momentum
and energy.

Once this is done, one may verify, in an analogous manner to the procedure of Sec-
tion III D, that the matching conditions are satisﬁed by f2 to the order of the approximation.
This is a lengthy, but straightforward computation that we omit here.

A circle on top of a bar means that the entire term under the bar should be symmetrized
and rendered traceless as implied by the notation of (18).

As we show in an appendix, if we expand the second-order pressure-tensor (65) and heat
ﬂux (66) we recover the same terms as the Burnett equation, as long as the second-order
contributions from P(1) and Q(1) are also included. This is necessary because both P(1)
and P(2) contain terms of all orders in τ (as do Q(1) and Q(2)). The coeﬃcients of the terms
agree with the conventional Burnett result for the Boltzmann collision operator if σ = 2/3,
which is a justiﬁcation for the Prandtl number ﬁx discussed in Section III C. To illustrate the
nature of the new form for the pressure tensor and heat ﬂux, we treat the case of ultrasonic
sound waves in the next section.

V. ULTRASONIC WAVES

It is known experimentally [25] that, when the frequency of a sound wave becomes compa-
rable with the collision frequency of particles, both the Navier–Stokes and Burnett equations
give poor accounts of the dispersion relations. In Refs. [10, 13, 26] the present theory was
found to give very good agreement with the data for phase velocities, in ﬁrst order, so that
it is not possible to do better with higher-order terms to within experimental error. As we
shall see, in the case with the Prandtl-number ﬁx, the higher-order terms do not make the
already excellent predictions worse at moderate relaxation times τ . This is not the case
with the Burnett equations, which are known to have a narrower domain of validity than

the Navier–Stokes equations [9]. When there is no ﬁx in ﬁrst order, our higher order terms
lead to an improvement.

We start by expanding the macroscopic variables about an equilibrium rest state (u0 ≡

0),

ρ = ρ0(1 + φ), T = T0(1 + θ),

p = p0(1 + ̟) ,

and, ﬁnd from the equation of state that (14), ̟ = φ + θ. The linearized equations of

Taking the density and temperature perturbations φ and θ proportional to exp(i(kx
ωt))
we obtain a relation between k and ω, assuming neither of φ and θ vanishes identically. The
number ε = ωτ0 is dimensionless and can be regarded as the Knudsen number, the ratio of
the relaxation time (τ0) to the macroscopic time (1/ω). The approximation involved in a
Chapman–Enskog-type expansion get worse as ωτ0 becomes large.

−

To compare to experimental results, we plot the inverse phase speed k/ω as a function
of 1/ωτ0. Figure 1 shows the real part, and Fig. 2 the imaginary part (damping). The phase
speed is in units of the adiabatic sound speed, (γp0/ρ0)1/2, where γ = 5/3.

VI. DISCUSSION

According to Grad [9] and Uhlenbeck [3], the Hilbert expansion of f in terms of mean
ﬂight times is asymptotic and not convergent. For this reason, we have avoided using an
iterative procedure like those of Chapman and of Enskog. In their ways of deriving the ﬂuid
equations [2], it is the practice to use lower-order approximations to simplify the current
approximation. In particular, the Chapman–Enskog approach uses the Euler equations to
simplify the calculation of the ﬂuid equations at ﬁrst order, and the Navier–Stokes equations
at second order. Here, we do not recycle lower-order results in this way and so we obtain
equations at a given order of accuracy N that diﬀer from the Chapman–Enskog results
by terms O
In other words, our results agree asymptotically with those of the
Chapman–Enskog procedure but, when we apply the two theories at the edges of their
validities, we see diﬀerences in their quantitative predictions.

τ N +1

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

.

The eﬀect of this diﬀerence in approach is seen starkly when we take the trace of the

stress tensor, P. By deﬁnition, the trace of the pressure tensor is

×
P = 3p

(80)

while the trace of our Nth approximation to the stress tensor, PN , has a trace of 3p +
O(τ N +1). It appears to be a common misconception that it is required to make the extra
O(τ N +1) terms vanish whenever possible and a that theory that retains some form of them is
somehow deﬁcient. However, we are perfectly at liberty to retain terms O(τ N +1) in a theory
that is intended to be good to O(τ N ). Indeed, we suggest that, in the present instance, it is
even desirable to retain the extra terms in P.

In the theory described here, as in the ﬁrst-order version, we have PN = p I + τ N +1A

where the tensor A has a nonzero trace. Our approximation at order N is

P = p I + Aτ N + O(τ N +1)

(81)

15

(82)

and, if we now take the trace on both sides of this equation, we obtain

×
A + O(τ ) = 0 .

Iterative procedures like Chapman–Enskog theory force A to vanish and, on that account,
(82) cannot be satisﬁed unless τ is truly inﬁnitesimal. But, in our approach, (82) is not an
embarrassment since it points a way to increase the domain of validity of our approximation
by making a suitable choice of A. As we have observed, the expansion procedure oﬀers a
natural choice for A and the problem is then to test its accuracy.

As in most physics problems, we prefer to let the choice among the theories be made by the
experiments, which do favor our approach over the standard Chapman–Enskog treatment.
Indeed, with the Prandtl number adjustment, our results from the relaxation model seem to
be preferred to those from the Boltzmann equation in the Chapman–Enskog approach. We
shall return to the discussion of our approach to the Boltzmann equation in another place.
Here, we have remained in the relatively simple case of the relaxation model whose results
seem as good as those with the Boltzmann model once the Prandtl number is adjusted (see
also the discussion of the so-called BGK–Burnett equations in [8]). It may even be that for
rareﬁed gases, the relaxation model is preferable in dealing with the , problem [15].

In the study of ultrasound, the propagation speed we predict agrees well with the experi-
mental ﬁndings at all Knudsen numbers. However, our results for the damping of ultrasound
are good (as judged by experiment) only for Knudsen number up to order unity. Since our
second-order results are an improvement over the ﬁrst order ones, we may hope for im-
provement as higher orders are achieved. But in practice, going to higher order than second
would seem to be prohibitively complicated, even if the calculations could be performed.
The problem is then what ought to be the approach to the damping of sound waves in the
limit of very long mean ﬂight times of particles.

One clue is that for moderate Knudsen numbers we have some negative damping for
a small range of ﬂight times. This is reminiscent of the instability reported by Jin and
Slemrod [27, 28] for the Burnett equations. They cure this problem with a regularization
procedure that involves manipulation of high order terms, as Rosenau has also done [29].
(Such procedures have also proved eﬀective in certain problems of photon transport.) Similar
procedures may be used to ameliorate our approach and we shall return to that possibility
elsewhere. For the present, we are concerned with the discussion of the basic expansion
procedures. In that connection, we may mention a ﬁnal issue.

Stubbe [17] has argued that the dynamics of rareﬁed gases cannot be well treated macro-
scopically and a that microscopic approach is needed as in the case of plasma physics where
no macroscopic approach has produced Landau damping [19, 30]. On the other hand, it
may be that a suitable resummation of the results of lower orders would resolve the issue. In
any case, it appears that the study of the damping of ultrasound waves is going to involve
serious complications.

These are not the second-order pressure and heat ﬂux of the Burnett equation. To recover
the Burnett result, we need to expand to ﬁrst order in τ the Σ and Ψ terms appearing in
the ﬁrst order pressure tensor and heat ﬂux (44).

First we do this for Ψ, which enters the heat ﬂux in (34). On inserting (44) in (34) we

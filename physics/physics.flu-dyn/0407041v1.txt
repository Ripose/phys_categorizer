It is shown that dynamics of the interface between ideal ﬂuid and light viscous ﬂuid is exactly inte-
grable in the approximation of small surface slopes for two-dimensional ﬂow. Stokes ﬂow of viscous
ﬂuid provides a relation between normal velocity and pressure at interface. Surface elevation and
velocity potential of ideal ﬂuid are determined from two complex Burgers equations corresponding
to analytical continuation of velocity potential at the interface into upper and lower complex half
planes, respectively. The interface loses its smoothness if complex singularities (poles) reach the
interface.

Dynamics of an interface between two incompressible
ﬂuids is an important fundamental problem which has
numerous applications ranging from interaction between
see and atmosphere to ﬂow through porous media and
superﬂuids. If one neglects gravity and surface tension,
that problem can be eﬀectively solved in some partic-
ular cases in two dimensions with the use of complex
variables. Integrable cases include Stokes ﬂow of viscous
ﬂuid with free surface [1], dynamics of free surface of ideal
ﬂuid with inﬁnite depth [2] and ﬁnite depth [3], dynam-
ics of an interface between two ideal ﬂuids [4], ideal ﬂuid
pushed through viscous ﬂuid in a narrow gap between
two parallel plates (Hele-Shaw ﬂow) [5, 6, 7].

Here a new integrable case is found which corresponds
to two-dimensional motion of the interface between heavy
ideal ﬂuid and light viscous ﬂuid in absence of gravity
and capillary forces. The interface position is given by
z = η(x, t), where the ﬁrst, heavier ﬂuid (indicated by
index 1) with the density ρ1 occupies the region
<
z < η(x, t) and the second, lighter ﬂuid (index 2) with
the density ρ2 occupies the region η(x, t) < z <

−∞

Suppose that the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid 2, ν2,
is very large so that ﬂuid’s 2 ﬂow has small Reynolds
numbers and, neglecting inertial eﬀect in the Navier-
Stokes Eq., one arrives to the Stokes ﬂow Eq. [8]:

which ensure that the ﬂuid 2 responds very fast to per-
turbations of the interface as inertia of the ﬂuid 2 is very
small compare with ﬂuid’s 1 inertia while time dependent
perturbations of the ﬂuid 2 decay very fast due to large
viscosity ν2. According to Eq. (1), the response of the

ﬂuid 2 to motion of the interface is static. For any given
normal velocity of the interface, vn, Eq. (1) allows to
determine the pressure p2|z=η at the interface. In other
words, the ﬂuid 2 adiabatically follows the slow motion
of the heavy ﬂuid 1 and Reynolds number of the ﬂuid 2
remains small at all time.

tion (3) and the Laplace Eq. for the velocity ponetial φ
completely deﬁnes the potential motion of the ﬂuid 1.

corresponds to ρ2 = 0, then K is conserved, dK

It is easy to derive a wide class of initial conditions
for which solution (7), (8) exists globally and the inter-
face remains smooth at all times. E.g. one can take
u(+) = a0eik0x
0t, k0 = Re(k0) > 0 or any sum of
imaginary exponent which ensure that there is no zeros
at Im(x) = 0. However, it we suppose that there is a
random force pumping of energy into system (or random
initial condition) then one can expect that some trajecto-
ries with nonzero measure would have poles which reach
real axis in a ﬁnite time.

In conclusion, one can mention possible physical ap-
plications. Eqs. (7), (8) describe a free surface dynamics

diﬀerent from given in this Letter because both ﬂuids oc-
cupy the same volume but resulting Eqs. are exactly the
same as (7), (8). For classical ﬂuids viscosity is nonzero
but ν1 can be neglected and the ﬂuid 1 can be considered
as ideal ﬂuid provided the ratio of dynamic viscosities of
1. E.g. that ratio is
two ﬂuids is large, ν2ρ2/(ν1ρ1)

sities is

The persistence of viscous eﬀects in the overlap region,
and the mean velocity in turbulent pipe and
channel ﬂows

Abstract

We expand on our previous argument (Sreenivasan 1987) that important elements of the dynamics of
wall-bounded ﬂows reside at the wall-normal position yp corresponding to the peak of the Reynolds
shear stress. Specializing to pipe and channel ﬂows, we show that the mean momentum balance in
the neighborhood of yp is distinct in character from those in the classical inner and outer layers. We
revisit empirical data to conﬁrm that yp = O((hν/U∗)1/2) and show that, in a neighborhood of order
1/2
R
around yp, only the viscous eﬀects balance pressure-gradient terms. Here, R∗ = hU∗/ν, h is
∗
the pipe radius or channel half-width, ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid and U∗ is the friction
velocity. This observation provides a mechanism by which viscous eﬀects play an important role in
regions traditionally thought to be inviscid or inertial; in particular, it throws doubt on the validity of
the classical matching principle. Even so, it is shown that the classical semi-logarithmic behavior for
the mean velocity distribution can be a valid approximation. It is argued that the recently advanced
power-law proﬁles possess a rich underlying structure, and could be good approximations to the data
over an extended region (but they too are unlikely to be exact).

Introduction

≡

Essentially all the important notions in wall-bounded ﬂows are cast in terms of two length
scales:
the inner or viscous scale ν/U∗, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid
and U∗ is the friction velocity (
τw/ρ, τw and ρ being the wall shear stress and ﬂuid
density, respectively), and the outer scale h, where h is the pipe radius, channel half-width
or boundary layer thickness. The ratio of the two scales is the Reynolds number R∗ = hU∗/ν.
, one may expect that
Since the appropriate asymptotics correspond to the limit R∗
the problem has elements of singular perturbation. We shall use the standard notation that
U + = U/U∗ and y+ = yU∗/ν, y being the normal distance from the wall. It is traditionally
thought that the viscous eﬀects are important up to a y+ of about 30 and that, within this
region, the outer length scale h is unimportant. In the bulk of the ﬂow excluding this viscous
region, it is thought that ν is unimportant and the characteristic length is h. This view has
been quite successful in organizing various experimental data (see, e.g., Sreenivasan 1989,

→ ∞

p

Dussauge et al. 1996), though it has been recognized for some time (e.g., Rao et al. 1971)
that the interaction between the two scales is the key to the ﬂow structure.

In an earlier paper (Sreenivasan 1987), we noted that a proper understanding of the
boundary layer structure requires greater emphasis on wall-normal position where the Reynolds
shear stress peaks. This peak position scales as the geometric mean of the inner and outer
length scales. It is well known (e.g., Drazin & Reid 1981) that, in linear and early stages of
nonlinear instability in boundary layers and channel ﬂows, the position of the peak Reynolds
shear stress coincides with the critical layer. This observation was inverted in Sreenivasan
(1987) to suggest that the position of the peak Reynolds shear stress, yp, in turbulent wall
ﬂows plays something of the same role as that of the critical layer in unstable wall ﬂows. It
was pointed out that, just as for critical layer in unstable wall ﬂows, the mean velocity at
yp is approximately a constant fraction of the freestream or centerline velocity, the fraction
being about 0.65. Other analogies between the critical layer in the unstable state and the
‘critical layer’ in the turbulent state were also cited.

The critical layer in unstable boundary layers is the seat of perturbation vorticity which
undergoes ampliﬁcation when the Reynolds number exceeds a certain threshold. The next
stages of the perturbation development involve the onset of three dimensionalities and,
eventually, of turbulence itself.
If the turbulent vorticity in the boundary layer can be
caricaturized as a vortex sheet, it was thought by analogy that its seat would be yp. By
interaction with image vorticity (invoked to mimic the presence of the wall), this hypothetical
vortex sheet located at yp gets lumped ﬁrst into two-dimensional rolls and, eventually, into
horse-shoe shaped vortices. These latter structures are comparable in several respects to
those found from visualization studies of the boundary layer (e.g., Head & Bandyopadhyay
1981). It was further argued, albeit with less certainty, that the same picture can explain
aspects of the structure in the wall region, for example the (noisy) spanwise periodicity of
streaks (Kline et al. 1967). For quantitative details and comparisons with data, one should
consult Sreenivasan (1987).

Whatever the detailed objections to the physical content of the model and however
preliminary the attempt, it appeared that a self-contained picture of the boundary layer
could be developed on that basis. Unlike in the predecessor paper (Sreenivasan 1987) which
focused on the large-scale structural elements of the boundary layer, we shall examine here
the mean velocity distribution to reiterate, in quite a diﬀerent way, the importance of the
‘critical layer’. This seems to be an especially timely goal because of the renewed interest and
recent controversy surrounding the mean velocity distribution in pipe ﬂows (e.g., Barenblatt
& Chorin 1996, Zagarola & Smits 1997).

In the classical picture, one assumes the existence of a common region of validity of the
, and puts

outer and inner solutions of ∂U +(R∗, y+)/∂y+ in the limit R∗
forth asymptotic arguments to obtain

U +(R∗, y+) = (1/κ) ln y+ + B,

where κ and B are empirical constants presumed to be independent of R∗. This is the
celebrated log-law, which occupies a central place in the turbulence literature (e.g., Coles &

2

≈

Hirst 1969, Monin & Yaglom 1971, Tennekes & Lumley 1972). It is generally thought that
30 and y+
y+
0.15R∗ are the lower and upper limits of the logarithmic proﬁle and the
K´arm´an constant κ
5.5 (see, for example, Coles & Hirst 1969). There is
still some uncertainty about these constants: recent high-Reynolds-number measurements
in pipe ﬂows (Zagarola 1996) yield κ = 0.44 and B = 6.1.

There exist alternative formulations for the overlap region (Long & Chen 1981, Baren-
blatt 1993, Barenblatt & Chorin 1996, George et al. 1996, George & Castillo 1996). Here,
we shall restrict attention to Barenblatt’s formulation. Its primary contention is that the
limit of small-viscosity (or high Reynolds number) is singular—as is common in second-
order phase transitions in condensed matter (Domb & Green 1976) and also, perhaps, in
Kolmogorov turbulence (Monin & Yaglom 1975)—and so the viscous eﬀects never disappear
in the overlap region. This imperils the classical matching argument and the orthodox view
that the log-law is exact in the inﬁnite Reynolds number limit. Speciﬁcally, note that di-
mensional considerations allow us to write the velocity distribution in an intermediate layer
in the form

y+(∂U +/∂y+) = ψ(y+, R∗),

where ψ is an unknown function of its arguments. In the classical picture, ψ is thought to
asymptote to a constant, say 1/κ, as the arguments of ψ, namely R∗ and y+, assume large
values. Integration then yields the log-law. On the other hand, suppose that

y+(∂U +/∂y+) = (1/κ)(y+)α,

α being some positive constant. This leads to a power-law for the mean velocity distribution.
In particular, Barenblatt (1993) and Barenblatt & Chorin (1996) predict the asymptotic
nature of U + in two regions of the ﬂow—the classical overlap region (say B1) and a region
further out towards the center (say B2). In the power-law paradigm, B1 + B2 together form
the overlap region. The speciﬁc predictions are the following: (a) In B1, U + is tangent to
the classical logarithmic proﬁle to which it remains close but from which it always remains
distinct. (b) In B2, the power law can be approximated properly by a logarithmic function
similar to the classical log-law but with a slope that is approximately √e times that of the
classical value. It may be thought that this latter prediction does not contradict the classical
log-law because the domains of the two logarithmic regions are disjoint. However, because
B2 would be a part of the outer region in the classical picture, one may consider that a
conﬂict does exist here as well.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of the mean velocity distribution
brieﬂy, emphasizing along the way two signiﬁcant qualitative issues: (a) The viscous eﬀects
are important in a region of pipe and channel ﬂows that is traditionally thought to be
inviscid and that, in fact, the balance there is between viscous and pressure gradient eﬀects.
Following Long & Chen (1981), we might call this ‘critical’ region a mesolayer (although we
do not necessarily subscribe to all the implications of that work). The existence of such a
mesolayer gives a new twist to the dynamics of the boundary layer, but the degree to which

(2)

(3)

3

the classical picture needs modiﬁcation is not yet clear (see section 4). (b) The importance
of viscosity in the mesolayer oﬀers a key to the regeneration mechanism of the boundary
layer. The discussion here will be necessarily brief, and more details will be published
elsewhere (Sahay & Sreenivasan 1996).

2 The background

2.1 The wall-normal position of the peak of the Reynolds shear stress

≡ −h

Central to the present arguments is the manner in which the Reynolds or turbulent shear
, is distributed in the ﬂow; here u and v are velocity ﬂuctuations in the
stress, τ
i
streamwise coordinate x and the wall-normal coordinate y, respectively, and
denotes a
suitable average. Its behavior in pipe and channel ﬂows is shown qualitatively in Fig. 1. The
∗ increases from its zero value at the wall, apparently like y3 for small
quantity τ +
y, and rapidly reaches about half the maximum value at a y+ of about 12. It continues to
increase further to reach a maximum value at yp. The maximum value equals τw in the limit
, but falls short of τw at any ﬁnite R∗, by an amount, say, ∆(R∗). The Reynolds
R∗
stress τ decreases beyond yp, and reaches zero in the freestream of the boundary layer, and
on the centerline of the pipe or channel.

where λ = 1.87 and 2, respectively. Although the two prefactors are somewhat diﬀerent,
they agree on the principal result that the peak of the Reynolds shear stress occurs at a y+
. We revisit this issue here. Figure 2a shows plots of τ + vs y+/R1/2
that increases as R1/2
for a range of Reynolds numbers. The R1/2
p appears to be a good leading
order approximation. There is some correction to this scaling at the lowest R∗, which we
shall examine subsequently. For the present, we have ignored the low R∗ data in estimating
λ. On the basis of Fig. 2a, we take R∗
500 as an operational deﬁnition of the low Reynolds
number. Figure 2b is an expanded plot near the peak of τ +. An accurate determination
of y+
p for large R∗ is diﬃcult because the peak is rather ﬂat (and becomes more so with
increasing R∗) and because there is much scatter in the data. Mindful of these uncertainties
we estimate that λ = 1.8

The point to emphasize is that, for all but the very low R∗, y+

) lies well
y+
within the classical logarithmic region (30
0.15R∗). We shall now discuss its role in
determining the distribution of the mean velocity in boundary layer ﬂows. The discussion is
specialized for analytical convenience to plane channel ﬂow and axisymmetric pipe ﬂow. The
simplicity to be gained is that all the terms in the mean momentum equation are independent
of the streamwise direction.

(5)

where P is the mean pressure and U is the mean velocity depending only on y. The Reynolds
shear stress term appears in the equation as an unknown. We now make the obvious point
that, at the position at which the turbulent shear stress τ is a maximum, i.e., at yp, the
pressure gradient terms are balanced only by viscous terms; the Reynolds stress terms are
entirely absent because the quantity that appears in the momentum equation is the Reynolds
shear stress gradient, not the Reynolds shear stress itself. We have already seen that yp
resides in the part of the boundary layer traditionally thought to be independent of viscosity,
or purely inertial. This means that, within a region in pipes and channels that has been
thought to be inertial, there exists a neighborhood within which only viscous terms are capable
of balancing the pressure gradient terms nearly entirely.

How large is this neighborhood? To answer this question, we plot in Fig. 3 the ratio
of the Reynolds shear stress gradient term to the viscous term in the vicinity of y+
p . Using
experimental data for the purpose would have generated much scatter, so our estimates are

the numerical diﬀerentiation of the measured velocity proﬁle using Eq. (6) of section 3. Zagarola’s
data for higher Reynolds numbers could not be used because the mean velocity data have not been
measured close enough to the wall.

It appears natural that we should use Eq. (6) to understand the mean velocity distribution
by approximating τ + in the form of a double expansion around y+
p and about the supremum
value of unity (attained in the inﬁnite Reynolds number limit). We have accordingly per-
formed a local analysis (local in y+), in the limit R∗
, of Eq. (6) in regions I and II and
III shown in the typical τ + proﬁle of Fig. 1. The regions are deﬁned as domains of validity

I is the classical viscous region, and III can be thought to be the classical outer region.
Viscous terms are signiﬁcant in both I and II, but the classical buﬀer region, in which these
terms are small in relative magnitude, is interposed between the two regions. This makes
the two regions distinct. Here we shall focus on II nearly entirely. The analysis of regions I
and III in the same spirit yields some signiﬁcantly new results (Sahay & Sreenivasan 1996)
which will be summarized only as needed.

3.2 The logarithmic ‘law’

An exact logarithmic proﬁle would obtain if, in a nonzero neighborhood of ξ = 0, the ﬁrst
term in Eq. (10) is dominant in the limit R∗
p ). The second term is of
the order of the ﬁrst term and thus can be neglected only if it is identically zero, which
requires the exact equality of a and 2λ. This assessment requires a numerical estimate of
the constant a, which we examine in Fig. 4.

, y+ = O(y+

→ ∞

Here again it is diﬃcult to determine the coeﬃcient accurately owing to ﬁnite-Reynolds-
number corrections. Ideally, one would consider data in intervals like [R∗,
) for increasing
R∗ and look for convergence of the least-square estimates of the coeﬃcient a. The inset in
Fig. 4 shows our attempt at implementing this algorithm within the constraints of ﬁnite
maximum R∗ and small number of data points. Least-square estimates of a are obtained
using n data points at the largest available Reynolds numbers. We have taken into account
only the data for R∗
500. We do not consider smaller than ﬁve points (i.e., we stop at
n = 5) since the ﬁt for a smaller value of n will lead to unacceptable statistical uncertainties.
The resulting estimate for a is 3.1

0.1 (see inset).

The uncertainty in the numerical estimates of a and λ allow for the possibility that

2λ
that empirical estimates will not settle the issue of exact equality of the two numbers. An
added ignorance factor is the lack of knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the functions
fn(R∗). For the logarithmic law to exist, the fn (derivatives of τ + at yp) must be o(∆).

In spite of the ambiguity regarding the existence of an exact logarithm law in region II, it

times larger than the universal log-law.

It is of interest to examine the local structure of Eq. (12) near y+

done by substituting (12) in the mean momentum equation (6) and solving for y+ = y+

4 Conclusions

The primary qualitative point of this work is that there exists a mechanism for viscous
eﬀects to spread to the classical overlap region. The existence of such a mechanism will in
principle prevent classical matching, so that the leading order ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ expansions
are technically insuﬃcient to construct a uniformly valid approximation of the mean velocity
proﬁle.

What, then, can be said about the classical log-law? First, it must be noted that the
velocity change across the ‘mesolayer’ is not of the order unity, unlike in most boundary
layer problems, which may make its importance potentially less signiﬁcant. Second, just as
is done here for region II, we have analyzed regions I and III in some detail, making use
of the well-known forms of the Reynolds shear stress distributions in those regions. (For
example, in region III, one has a linear distribution of the Reynolds shear stress, with some
well-understood ﬁnite Reynolds number corrections.) It is then possible to patch together
the results from all three regions. A summary of this work is as follows. In region I, beyond
about y+
30, dU +/dy+ lies close to that implied by the classical logarithmic law. In region
II, we have already seen that the log-law can be a good approximation (and even exact in
a small neighborhood of y+
In region III, dU +/dy+ lies close to the classical value for
y+ smaller than 0.15R∗. It is therefore reasonable that one can smoothly match the three
regions and obtain a logarithmic variation of velocity between y+
0.15R∗,
regardless of whether it is exact.

What can be said of power-laws, in particular the Barenblatt proﬁle? In our present
view, a self-consistent way of understanding the origin of this proﬁle is to use Eq. (6) and
the appropriate expansions for ∆ and yp in B1 (and the appropriate version of ya in region
B2). We believe that the rich structure of power-law proﬁles makes them ﬁt the data well.
However, a close analysis of region III (Sahay & Sreenivasan 1996) reveals that asymptoti-
cally the velocity proﬁle cannot be exactly logarithmic in B2. The most signiﬁcant point in
favor of power laws is that they account, in some fashion, for viscous eﬀects to pervade in
the classical overlap region.

The importance of viscous eﬀects in a region traditionally thought to be inviscid has
other obvious analogies. The principal analogy is the Kolmogorov spectral cascade. Just
as viscous eﬀects are centered around the peak position of the Reynolds shear stress in
the present problem, one may imagine the viscous eﬀects in Kolmogorov turbulence may
be centered around the position of maximum energy transfer in wave number space. This
provides a natural mechanism for viscous eﬀects to encroach the inertial region of the spectral
space. Details are currently being worked out.

We have so far not speculated on the physical origin of the viscous eﬀects in the neigh-
borhood of yp. Two possible scenarios present themselves. It may well be that the bursting

13

of wall-layer streaks (which undoubtedly extend beyond the sublayer) carry viscous eﬀects
with them as they penetrate up to y+ = O(R1/2
). Alternatively, the viscous cores of the
coherent vortices in the ‘critical layer’ region are such that their eﬀects do not vanish at
any Reynolds number (Barenblatt 1993). Whatever the mechanism, it appears (Sreenivasan
1987) that the ‘critical layer’ or the mesolayer plays an important role in the dynamics of
wall ﬂows that cannot be subsumed in the classical picture.

Abstract

We show the possibility of quasiperiodic waves at the onset of thermal convection in a thin

horizontal layer of slowly rotating zero-Prandtl number Boussinesq ﬂuid conﬁned between stress-

free conducting boundaries. Two independent frequencies emerge due to an interaction between

a stationary instability and a self-tuned wavy instability in presence of coriolis force, if Taylor

number is raised above a critical value. Constructing a dynamical system for the hydrodynamical

problem, the competition between the interacting instabilities is analyzed. The forward bifurcation

from the conductive state is self-tuned.

conditions, in the limit of large thermal diﬀusitivity κ has been considered subtle for a long

time because the linearly unstable two-dimensional (2D) rolls become exact nonlinear so-

lution. The nonlinearity v

θ due to the advection of temperature ﬂuctuation θ by the

· ∇
velocity ﬁeld v might be negligible [1]. The nonlinearity v

v, due to the self interaction

· ∇

of velocity ﬁeld, does not contribute to saturation for straight (2D) rolls. This led to the

speculation that the zero P limit might involve a singular limit problem similar to the one

with inﬁnite Reynold number in incompressible ﬂuid dynamics. However, the recent three-

dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulation (DNS) of zero-Prandtl number Boussinesq

equations by Thual [11] showed the saturation instead of indeﬁnite growth of the solution

even with stress-free boundary conditions. He also compared the results of zero P equations

with that of the full Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations in the asymptotic limit of vanishing

P, and found complete agreement in two cases. The saturation of growing 2D rolls at the

onset of convection occurs by generation of self-tuned 3D waves, the mechanism of which

was explained in a simple model [12]. The results of this model, in its validity range, agreed

well with that of DNS just above the convective instability. The new nonlocal instability at

the onset occurs purely due to nonlinear eﬀects, while linear equations predict the stationary

instability [13].

We present, in this article, a dynamical system constructed for thermal convection in zero

Prandtl number Boussinesq ﬂuid, conﬁned between stress-free conducting ﬂat boundaries,

and subjected to a slow rotation about the vertical axis. We then investigate numerically

the system to study the eﬀect of coriolis force on the onset of convection. We show that

the convection sets in as quasiperiodic waves at the onset of convective instability for Tay-

lor number T above a critical value Tc, although the principle of exchange of stability is

valid according to the linear theory [13] for these Taylor numbers. The generation of two

independent frequencies is the result of an interaction between a stationary instability and

a self-tuned wavy perturbations in presence of coriolis force. This an example of a new

self-tuned forward bifurcation. For the values of Taylor number below Tc, the convection

sets in as self-tuned wavy instability as is the case in absence of rotation. However, the

model shows a possibility transition from one wavy instability to another through a narrow

2

window of period-doubling instability.

We consider a thin layer of a Boussinesq ﬂuid of inﬁnite horizontal extension subjected to

a uniform adverse temperature gradient β across the ﬂuid layer, and a rigid body rotation

with an angular velocity Ω about the vertical axis. The ﬂuid is assumed to have uniform

values of the kinematic viscosity ν and the thermal difusitivity κ. The basic state is the

conductive state with no ﬂuid motion in the rotating frame of reference. The convective ﬂow,

in the limit of zero-Prandtl number, is then described by the following system of dimesionless

The unit vector ˆe3 is directed vertically upward. We impose periodic boundary conditions

in horizontal plane. This introduces two fundamental wave numbers k along x-axis and q

along y-axis. The stress-free boundary conditions imply ∂zv1 = ∂zv2 = v3 = 0 at z = 0, 1.

Thermally conducting horizontal boundaries mean θ = 0 at z = 0, 1.

The hydrodynamical equations (1-3) are the same as those derived by Chandrasekhar [13].

We have nondimesionlized them and considered the case of zero P . We have also elemi-

nited the pressure term from Navier-Stokes equations by taking curl twice and using the

incompressibility condition (

v = 0). The conclusions derived from the linearized version

of the equations remain unchanged even in the present case. Following the arguments of

Chandrasekhar [13], one arrives at the conclusion that the principle of exchange of stabil-

ity is valid even in the limit discussed here. The critical value of Rayleigh number now

The 2D rolls are not exact solutions of nonlinear hydrodynamic system with rotation as is

the case in zero-Prandtl number convection in absence of rotation. Nevertheless, the grow-

ing 2D rolls are not saturated just above the onset of convective instability. The saturation

occurs only because of nonlinear interaction of 2D rolls with 3D wavy perturbations. To

understand the nonlinear behavior close to the convective instability, we construct a consis-

tent minimal-mode model using Galerkin technique [14]. We expand the vertical velocity v3

and the vertical vorticity ω3 in Fourier series compatible with the stress-free boundary con-

ditions and conducting thermal boundary conditions. As the DNS, in absence of rotation,

showed standing patterns [12] instead of traveling patterns, we expect similar behavior at

least for small rotation rates. Therefore, we expand the ﬁelds with real Fourier coeﬃcients.

This lead to the following expansion for the vertical velocity and the vertical vorticity in a

minimum-mode model.

v3(x, y, z, t) = W101(t) cos kcx sin πz

+ W111(t) cos kcx cos qy sin πz

+ W¯1¯11(t) sin kcx sin qy sin πz

+ ζ012(t) cos qy cos 2πz + ζ200(t) cos 2kcx

+ ζ210(t) cos 2kcx cos qy

+ ζ¯2¯10(t) sin 2kcx sin qy + . . .

The mode selection is quite systematic. As rotation couples the vertical velocity and the

vertical vorticity linearly, we have selected the mode ζ101. The mode ζ010 is essential to sat-

urate zero Prandtl number convection via wavy instability. All other modes appear through

the nonlinear interaction of these vorticity modes with the critical velocity mode W101. As

the vorticity ﬁeld is very crucial for saturation in the limit of vanishing Prandtl number, all

4

relevant second harmonics are retained for vertical vorticity. All relevant harmonics of the

vertical velocity ﬁeld, consistent with the selection of the vertical vorticity, are also retained.

Other higher order modes may be required as Rayleigh number is raised further. As we

are interested to capture essential nonlinear interaction between competing instabilities just

above the onset of convection, these modes are essential. The solenoidal character of the

velocity and the vorticity ﬁelds yield horizontal components of the velocity and the vorticity

ﬁelds. The thermal ﬂuctuation θ is captured from Eq. 3. Projecting the hydrodynamic

equations (1 - 3) on above modes, we arrive at a twelve-dimensional dynamical system [15].

We now investigate the solutions of the dynamical system by performing numerical in-

tegration of the model using standard fourth order Runge-Kutta as well as Bulirsh-Stoer

schemes. By choosing a value for T , we set kc(T ). We then choose a value for q. We have

tried with diﬀerent values of the wavenumber q of the perturbations and got qualitatively

similar results except when the ratio q/kc is close to unity. We present here all the results

for the case q/kc(T ) = 0.4. Initial values for all the twelve modes are chosen randomly, and

integration is done for a ﬁxed value of Rayleigh number R. We then repeat the process

by increasing the value of R in small steps. We have also tried various initial conditions.

The results of all the numerical integrations remain the same for the same values of all the

relevant parameters. In absence of rotation (T = 0), only six modes are excited. This model

then reproduces the results of the model [12] of zero P convection without rotation.

In

presence of rotation all twelve modes are excited as it should in a consistent model.

Figure 1 gives the stability boundaries of various possible solutions, in the parameter

space R

T , computed from the model dynamical system. The lowest line in Fig. 1 shows

−

linear dependence [13] of Rc, the critical Rayleigh number, on Taylor number T for the onset

of stationary convection in zero Prandtl number Boussinesq ﬂuid. The onset of overstability

for the case of vanishing P for the Taylor numbers considered here is much above, and is

not shown in the ﬁgure.

As Rayleigh number is raised above its critical value Rc(T ) for various values of Taylor

number below T = 6.0, conduction state becomes unstable via stationary bifurcation. How-

ever, 2D rolls with broken mirror symmetry [16] does not saturate until wavy perturbations

interact with them. This saturates the growing rolls at ﬁnite amplitude even at the onset.

The wavy perturbations are automatically generated when the amplitude of the 2D roll

mode becomes large enough. The self-tuned waves consume the energy of 2D rolls and stop

5

the unbounded growth of latter. This is precisely what happens when there is no rotation

and 2D rolls have mirror symmetry.

As Rayleigh number is increased slowly, the solution changes from one wavy solution to

another through a thin regime showing period doubling solutions (see the middle row of Fig.

2). The ﬁrst wavy solution SW 1 has 2D mode W101 with non-zero mean as in the absence

of rotation in zero P convection [12], while the second wavy solution SW 2 has 2D mode

with zero mean. As Rayleigh number is increased, the exchange of energy from 2D modes to

waves increases. The larger amplitude variation of vorticity modes is at the cost of energy

of 2D rolls. This is well known feature in the case of oscillatory instability.

As T is raised further, the rotation facilitates easily the exchange of more energy from the

2D roll mode W1010 to the vertical vorticity mode ζ101 through linear coupling. We observe

an interesting behavior for T > 6 (see Fig. 1). The conduction state becomes unstable via

stationary instability [13] but the ﬁnal state just above onset is quasiperiodic waves [17].

Figure 3 shows the variation of various modes with time. The amplitudes of all the modes

begin modulating at the same frequency. However, the ratio of the frequency of wavy motion

and that of amplitude modulation not an integer. The Fourier transform of these modes

shows two independent frequencies. The frequency of amplitude modulation is much smaller

compared to that for wavy motion. The sharp decrease of the amplitudes of higher order

modes conﬁrms the fast convergence of the expansion. The model, therefore, represents

accurately the scenario close to the instability onset. Figure 4 shows the projections of

phase space trajectories in various planes. It clearly describes the quasiperiodicity of the

convective ﬂow. The trajectories are conﬁned in twelve dimensional torous in the phase

space. The quasiperiodic behavior originates due to the nonlinear interaction among the 2D

velocity mode W101, the 2D vorticity mode ζ101 excited by rotation, and the wavy vorticity

mode ζ010. Figure 5 reveals some interesting details of the time dependence of of convective

patterns. The complex textures of the quasiperiodic patterns are shown over a period of

wavy motion, which is much faster than the amplitude modulation. The halves of a period

of wavy motion are quite asymmetric. The textures of the pattern at diﬀerent times are

never the same due to quasiperiodicity.

We have presented in this work a simple dynamical system, which describes the phe-

nomenon of thermal convection in rotating Boussinesq ﬂuid of zero Prandtl number very

close to the onset. For Taylor number above a critical value Tc, quasiperiodic waves are

observed at the instability onset. For very values of Taylor number below Tc, the coriolis

force causes one wavy instability to another through period doubling instability. We have

shown that convection might be possible as quasiperiodic waves, even if the principle of

exchange of stability is valid according to linearized hydrodynamical system. The saturation

to quasi-periodic convectie state is self-tuned purely due to the nonlinear eﬀects. This is an

example of new self-tuned bifurcation scenario from the conduction state to unsteady con-

vective state. The model presented would also be useful to study an interesting possibility

of transition from a state of rest to quasi-periodic chaos [18] at the primary instability.

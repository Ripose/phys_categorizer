(Received 2 February 2008)

We study the coalescence of two drops of an ideal ﬂuid driven by surface tension. The

velocity of approach is taken to be zero and the dynamical eﬀect of the outer ﬂuid

(usually air) is neglected. Our approximation is expected to be valid on scales larger than

ℓν = ρν2/σ, which is 10nm for water. Using a high-precision boundary integral method,

we show that the walls of the thin retracting sheet of air between the drops reconnect in

ﬁnite time to form a toroidal enclosure. After the initial reconnection, retraction starts

again, leading to a rapid sequence of enclosures. Averaging over the discrete events, we

ﬁnd the minimum radius of the liquid bridge connecting the two drops to scale like

t1/2.

1. Introduction

Drop coalescence arises in many diﬀerent contexts, and is crucial to our understanding

of free surface ﬂows (Eggers 1997). Examples are printing applications (Chaudhary &

Maxworthy 1980; Wallace 2001), drop impact on a ﬂuid surface (Oguz & Prosperetti

1990), and the coarsening of drop clouds and dispersions (MacPhee et al. 2002; Jury

2

L. Duchemin, J. Eggers and C. Josserand

et al. 1999; Verdier 2000). After the two surfaces have merged on a microscopic scale,

surface tension drives an extremely rapid motion, usually impossible to resolve in either

experiment (Bradley & Stow 1978; Menchaca-Rocha et al. 2001) or simulation (Lafaurie

et al. 1994). Thus theory is needed to investigate a possible dependence on initial condi-

tions, development of small-scale structures during merging, and to estimate the typical

time required for merging.

A large body of work exists on this problem in the case that viscosity is dominant

and the motion is described by Stokes’ equation. In the absence of an outer phase this is

known as the “viscous sintering problem” (Frenkel 1945; Hopper 1993; Martinez-Herrera

& Derby 1995), the inclusion of an outer phase is important for many problems governing

the coarsening of dispersion (Nikolayev et al. 1996; Verdier 2000). For the two-dimensional

problem (i.e. for the merging of cylinders) exact solutions exist (Hopper 1990; Richardson

1992; Crowdy 2002, To appear), which were shown (Eggers et al. 1999) to be asymp-

totically equivalent to their three-dimensional counterparts. The presence of an outer

ﬂuid leads to the formation of a toroidal bubble during merging (Eggers et al. 1999),

signiﬁcantly modifying the dynamics.

Fig. 1 shows two equal drops of radius R being connected by a liquid bridge of radius

rb, which is rapidly being pulled up by surface tension. The local Reynolds number of

this ﬂow can be estimated as Re = σrb/(ρν2), where σ is the surface tension, ρ the

density, and ν the kinematic viscosity. Thus, regardless of the value of the viscosity, the

Reynolds number is always small in the initial phases of the merging, which is equivalent

ℓν, where ℓν = ν2ρ/σ is the viscous length scale. However, ℓν is

to demanding that rb ≪
often very small (140 ˚A for water, and 4 ˚A for mercury (Eggers 1997)), so rb ≫
a large part of the evolution, and inviscid theory can be applied. Thus for a wide range

ℓν for

of practical problems the almost inviscid regime, which is the topic of this letter, is the

most relevant. Typically, the viscous regime will serve as an inner layer that deﬁnes the

initial condition for the inviscid problem we are interested in. In general, we do not have

to worry about the initial process of reconnection (Amarouchene et al. 2001), which for

clean ﬂuids is expected to take place over a microscopically small area.

In the case of a head-on collision of two drops with relative velocity V , considered

in (Oguz & Prosperetti 1989), a purely geometrical consideration predicts rb ≈
for two overlapping circles. The corresponding speed of merging is of the same order

√V Rt

as the surface-tension-driven merging to be described below, so V has thus to be taken

into account. However, we will restrict ourselves here to the case where the velocity

of approach is vanishingly small, a condition that is easily realizable experimentally

(Menchaca-Rocha et al. 2001). We also do not treat the dynamical eﬀect of an outer ﬂuid

like air, which might become important as the lubrication layer between the approaching

drops becomes very thin (Eggers et al. 1999; Yiantsos & Davis 1991). However, this

approximation is consistent with the assumption of a small velocity of approach.

2. Initial conditions and scaling laws

We consider two identical drops of radius R touching at a point where a thin liquid

bridge of size rb connects the two drops initially (cf. ﬁgure 1). The general problem of

drops of diﬀerent radii only changes a prefactor in the gap width between the drops

(Eggers 1998). For the inviscid dynamics considered here, all parameters of the problem

can be scaled out by writing the time and space coordinates in units of

ρR3/σ and R,

respectively. Assuming that the vorticity generated by the initial viscous motion can be

neglected, and using incompressibility, the velocity potential ϕ obeys

∆ϕ = 0.

The boundary condition on the free surface amounts to a balance between surface tension

and Bernoulli pressures (Oguz & Prosperetti 1989):

We have to solve (2.1),(2.2) with the initial condition shown in ﬁgure 1, assuming that

the bridge radius rb is initially very small (typically 10−5 in our numerical simulations).

Away from the point of contact at z = 0, but for h

(2.3)

and since ∂w/∂r

Assuming that the proﬁle in region (2.3) matches onto the bridge on the scale r

dimensional, equivalent to the merging of two ﬂuid cylinders. Thus a model problem

1 and the problem becomes eﬀectively two-

(Oguz & Prosperetti 1989; Eggers 1998) for the initial motion of the meniscus is that of

the two dimensional, straight slot shown in the inset of ﬁgure 1. The eventual widening

of the gap can be neglected on the scale of the gap width w.

The results of our computations for the full three-dimensional problem, to be explained

in more detail below, are shown in ﬁgure 2. As the meniscus retracts, the rapid ﬂuid ﬂow

past the sides of the gap creates an under-pressure as described by Bernoulli’s equation

(2.2), which in turn causes the end to expand into a bubble. As the bubble increases

in size, capillary waves are excited in its wake, with amplitude roughly proportional to

the bubble radius. Thus after the amplitude of the capillary wave has grown to the half

width of the slot w/2, its two sides touch and reconnect at a time τc. Since the width is

the only length scale in the problem, it follows that the total length rc the meniscus has

retracted up to the point of reconnection is proportional to w, while the time τc required

scales like w3/2. We thus have

rc = r0w,

τc = τ0w3/2,

(2.4)

where r0, τ0 are constants to be determined numerically. Below we ﬁnd in fact r0 =

10, τ0 = 7.6.

After the two sides of the gap have reconnected, this new initial condition looks very

similar to the original one, except for a non-trivial velocity ﬁeld that remains. But since

At a time τc = τ0 w3/2 = 7.6 w3/2 the walls of the gap touch and the minimum radius zmin goes

most of the resistance to the motion before reconnection is due to the large bubble that

was left behind, this velocity can be neglected relative to the velocity to be generated at

the next stage of the motion (more detailed estimates are given below). This means that

at each step the same motion repeats itself, but with a slightly larger radius rb. At the

n-th step we can thus write, analogous to (Eggers 1998),

For very small initial rb reconnection occurs in rapid succession, with small relative

The scaling law (2.6) is the central result of the present letter. Eventually, when rb is of

the same order than the drop radius, the widening of the channel overcomes the growth

of capillary waves, and the enclosure of bubbles stops. This is when the time scale of

no more voids are entrapped for rb > 0.035, in good agreement with our theoretical

estimate. Below we present detailed numerical tests of the scaling predictions, and inves-

tigate further the crucial stage of bubble growth, from which we are able to extract the

numerical constants r0, τ0.

3. Boundary integral method

If the ﬂow can be considered potential and incompressible, the use of a boundary

integral method is advantageous, since the velocity ﬁeld can be calculated from the

interface shape. Thus one only needs to keep track of the interface, represented by a

one-dimensional curve, and grid reﬁnement can be done very eﬃciently. The majority

of these boundary integral methods require smoothing of the surface, in order to avoid

short wave length instabilities. The method brieﬂy presented here does not require any

explicit smoothing, except for a redistribution of the points around the tip at every time

step. This redistribution can act as a smoothing, but no damping of instabilities, such

as an artiﬁcial surface viscosity, has been used.

The dipole formulation used here is very close to the one described by Baker, Meiron

8

L. Duchemin, J. Eggers and C. Josserand

and Orszag (Baker et al. 1980), but it needs to be reﬁned to be able to resolve the very

disparate scales of the drops and of the highly curved region close to the meniscus. At a

given time step, we expect the velocity potential ϕ to be known, from which we calculate

the normal and the tangential velocity of the surface. This velocity is then used to advect

the surface, and to advance ϕ using Bernoulli’s equation (2.2). The tangential velocity is

calculated directly by diﬀerentiating with respect to the arclength along the interface:

(3.4)

Classical iterative solutions of (3.3),(3.4) were found to fail for very small bridge radii,

so (3.3),(3.4) were solved by matrix inversion instead. A simple trapezoidal rule was used

to convert the equations into linear systems, which was then solved by LU decomposi-

tion. In order to compute the curvature of the surface and the tangential derivatives in

(3.1),(3.2), we re-parametrized the integrals by introducing a new integration variable ζ,

which equals i at grid-point i. This avoids instabilities in the cubic spline interpolation

that would otherwise be present if two points come very close together, as it happens at

the tip.

At each time step, the Bernoulli equation and the kinematic condition were used to

advance the solution using a Crank-Nicolson scheme (Press et al. 1992). The implicit

equations were solved by iteration, which required less than 10 iterations until a relative

error of 10−5 in the velocity potential was reached. An explicit Runge-Kutta fourth order

scheme was also tested, but found to be too unstable for small values of rb.

We also redistribute grid-points at every time step according to the their distance from

the tip. Cubic splines are used to interpolate to the new points. At each time step points

are placed on the free surface with grid spacing δ; typical values are shown in ﬁgure 3.

This spacing is used up to a distance of 40 r2

b from the tip, after which it is gradually

increased in steps of 2, since much lower resolution is required far from the tip.

4. Reconnection

As we have explained above, the retraction of the meniscus is interrupted by the

reconnection of the two sides of the gap, and the distance rc by which the meniscus

recoils as well as the time τc required is given by the scaling relations (2.4). In ﬁgure 2 we

deﬁne typical quantities characterizing the retraction of the meniscus. The minimum gap

radius zmin marks the ﬁrst trough of a train of capillary waves that is generated by the

growing bubble. Note that in the corresponding simulation in (Oguz & Prosperetti 1990)

(cf. ﬁgure 4) there is little or no indication of this growth of capillary waves. We suspect

that these authors did not follow the retraction for suﬃciently long times, and that the

low resolution of their simulation introduced additional damping, which smoothed out

the capillary waves.

As seen in ﬁgure 3, the time dependence of the minimum gap radius zmin converges

towards a close to linear behavior as the resolution is increased. Extrapolation towards

zmin = 0 thus gives a reliable estimate of the time required for reconnection. Although

the walls of the gap do not interact physically, errors of our boundary integral description

grow large as two surfaces become close to each other. The reason is that the distance λ

between points varies on scale zmin close to the minimum, so the grid spacing δ always

needs to be smaller than zmin.

From the simulations we deduce the values r0 = 10 and τ0 = 7.6 for the reduced

retraction length and time already reported in section 2. Here the underlying assumption

is that the dynamics is controlled by the local gap width alone. To test this idea, we have

computed a sequence of pinch events as shown in ﬁgure 4. When zmin has gone down to

about 10 % of the local gap radius w/2, the gap is cut at about w/2 behind the minimum

and new points are introduced along the new surface. Our method of redistributing points

automatically introduced a certain smoothing, which was enough for the simulation to

continue. Obtaining a new initial condition for the velocity proﬁle proved to be much

more diﬃcult. Simply extrapolating the velocity potential ϕ before the surgery to the

new initial condition led to instabilities that could no longer be controlled numerically, so

instead we had to put the velocity ﬁeld to zero. This is justiﬁed by the fact that the gap

position very quickly re-assumes its retraction velocity after the bubble is left behind, as

we discuss in more detail below.

As illustrated in ﬁgure 4, this leads to a self-similar succession of pinch-oﬀ events. Each

simulation was started from a new value of the bridge radius rn

b . The typical gap width

at the meniscus is then w = (rn

b )2. A more quantitative test of the scalings employed

in section 2 is presented in ﬁgure 5, where we plot the bridge radius rb as a function of

time and, in the inset, rc/τc = (r0/τ0)/rn

b as function of the bridge radius at the time

of pinching. The excellent agreement with the predicted scaling behavior conﬁrms our

assumption that the local dynamics only depends on the gap width at the corresponding

radius rn
b .

We also did not follow the evolution of the bubble after it was cut oﬀ from the gap.

Since it starts from a highly non-circular shape, it is expected to perform large amplitude

oscillations. Remembering that the bubble is really a torus in three-dimensional space,

it will also be unstable with respect to the Rayleigh instability (Drazin & Reid 1982)

and break up into a sequence of smaller bubbles. Evidently, this instability breaks the

rotational symmetry and is thus well beyond the scope of the present work.

accelerated by two line forces, in greater detail. Thus if

After this initial period of acceleration, the bubble radius zmax starts to grow and the

speed of retraction vtip reaches a maximum, as seen in ﬁgure 7. This maximum must be

set by the initial width w of the gap, and thus dimensional arguments lead to

2/w.

The prefactor in (5.3) comes from balancing the inertial term v2

c /2 with the surface

tension force κ in (2.2), in analogy with the arguments of Culick and Taylor (Culick

1960; Taylor 1959) for receding soap ﬁlms. The curvature κ has been approximated by

1/w. As conﬁrmed by ﬁgure 7, the maximum of vtip is well approximated by the estimate

(5.3).

After reaching a maximum, the speed of retraction decreases steadily, as the bubble

grows and with it the added mass that has to be dragged along. The transversal bubble

expansion is due to the rapid ﬂuid motion along its sides which, according to Bernoulli’s

equation (2.2), causes an under-pressure. Conversely, at the stagnation point behind the

bubble the pressure is high and the bubble is curved inward (cf. ﬁgure 2). We do not yet

have a fully quantitative theory of the bubble expansion, since this would require a precise

knowledge of the bubble’s shape. Namely, the ﬂuid speed vm past the crest of the bubble

is determined by its curvature κc (Lamb 1993): vm = vtipκczmax, in analogy to the ﬂow

past an ellipsoidal body. To close the system of equations, we would need an expression

for κc. However, we notice from ﬁgure 6 that the temporal growth of the bubble size

≈

Eventually, when the toroidal bubble separates from the gap, the velocity vtip has

decreased to about half of vc. Therefore, the eﬀect of the dynamical pressure v2

tip/2 is

reduced considerably relative to the capillary pressure. Numerically, we ﬁnd that the

capillary force is at least 4 times bigger than the dynamical pressure, which indicates

that the velocity ﬁeld can safely be neglected at reconnection, as we are forced to do

owing to limitations of our numerical technique.

6. Discussion

We have shown that the merging of low viscosity ﬂuid droplets leads to a self-similar

sequence of void entrapments. It is interesting to note that the same power law behavior

(2.6) of rb can be formally derived from a continuous evolution if vtip is assumed to be

the Culick velocity (5.3). If the gap width w is estimated form the geometrical constraint

w

r2
b , this immediately leads to ∂trb ≈

≈

√2/rb, which can be integrated to give a power

t1/2. This is the argument given in (Eggers et al. 1999), which did not take reconnection

into account. The reason it ends up to give the correct answer (apart from the prefactor)

is that the size of the gap tip is rescaled to agree with the geometrical estimate (2.3) at

each reconnection event. Thus although the bubble actually grows to a much larger size

than r2

b , the balance implied by the above argument is actually true on average.

16

L. Duchemin, J. Eggers and C. Josserand

It might be equally tempting (Lister 2002) to apply the same reasoning to the force

balance (5.1), by approximating (at least on average) the added mass by Mtip ≈
r4
b . Integrating the corresponding equation of motion leads to rb ∝

conservation implied by (5.1). Owing to bubble growth, momentum is distributed over a

much larger volume than estimated from the simple geometrical argument. Accordingly,

in the asymptotic limit of t

1 one obtains a motion that is faster than that given by

the full calculation including reconnection.

We would ﬁnally like to point out some questions inspired by this work. Firstly, it

would be nice to develop a more complete theory of the bubble growth at the end of

the receding meniscus. Secondly, we are not yet able to fully treat the velocity ﬁeld

after reconnection. Such a treatment may lead to an increase in ﬂuctuations and perhaps

some randomness during retraction. As pointed out in (Oguz & Prosperetti 1990), a ﬁnite

velocity of approach will increase the likelihood of bubble entrapment during coalescence.

Other interesting generalizations not yet considered in the present paper are the eﬀect of

an external ﬂuid as well as viscous corrections. Clearly, a number of theoretical questions

remain open. Perhaps more importantly, detailed experimental studies are called for, for

example to verify the phenomenon of bubble entrainment predicted by our analysis.

It is our pleasure to thank St´ephane Zaleski for its constant encouragement during this

work.

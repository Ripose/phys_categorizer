Numerical and experimental studies of transitional pipe ﬂow have shown the prevalence of coherent
ﬂow structures that are dominated by downstream vortices. They attract special attention because
they contribute predominantly to the increase of the Reynolds stresses in turbulent ﬂow. In the
present study we introduce a convenient detector for these coherent states, calculate the fraction of
time the structures appear in the ﬂow, and present a Markov model for the transition between the
structures. The fraction of states that show vortical structures exceeds 24% for a Reynolds number
of about Re = 2200, and it decreases to about 20% for Re = 2500. The Markov model for the
transition between these states is in good agreement with the observed fraction of states, and in
reasonable agreement with the prediction for their persistence. It provides insight into dominant
qualitative changes of the ﬂow when increasing the Reynolds number.

INTRODUCTION

The visualization of turbulent ﬂows and boundary lay-
ers via sophisticated experimental methods like particle
imaging velocimetry has led to the identiﬁcation of a
rich variety of prominent coherent structures, such as
waves, streaks, hairpin vortices and lambda vortices[1,
2, 3, 4]. These extended coherent structures signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuence large scale momentum transport and
hence Reynolds stresses. As a consequence, they ﬁgure
prominently in turbulence research.

Studies on internal ﬂows in conﬁned geometries have
highlighted the dominant role of structures containing
pronounced downstream vortices and have led to the pro-
posal of a three-step self regenerating mechanism for tur-
bulence [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Downstream vortices
transport liquid across the mean shear gradient and cre-
ate regions of fast or slow moving ﬂuid, so-called high-
and low-speed streaks. The streaks generated by this lift-
up process become unstable to the formation of normal
vortices, and through a nonlinear interaction mechanism
the latter feed their energy back to downstream vortices.
This closed self-regeneration mechanism appears to be a
generic dynamical feature of turbulent shear ﬂows. The
process was identiﬁed in direct numerical simulations of
plane Couette ﬂow in narrow cells where transverse mod-
ulations are constrained [6, 8, 13], but it can also be
detected in time-correlation functions in fully turbulent
ﬂows [14].

In its purest form this self-regenerating cycle gives rise
to a periodic solution to the equations of motion. How-
ever, in most coherent structures the ﬂow is not strictly
periodic and always perturbed by background ﬂuctu-

ations. Examples of exact coherent states have been
given in simple models, where they correspond to peri-
odic orbits [15, 16, 17, 18], and, in the full ﬂow, through
the numerical identiﬁcation of exact coherent states in
channel ﬂows [11, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] and

cases, the coherent structures are dominated by pairs
of counter-rotating downstream vortices and associated
streaks which are regularly arranged in azimuthal direc-
tion. The ﬂow ﬁelds are invariant under discrete rota-
tions around the pipe axis.

Since all exact coherent states constructed so far are
linearly unstable it came as a surprise that they could be
directly observed in experiments [30]. In this work we fol-
low up on this experimental observation with a study of
the appearance and persistence of these structures in nu-
merical simulations of pipe ﬂow. In particular, we show
how they can be detected, how frequently they appear,
and how long they persist.

The travelling waves observed in pipe ﬂow are of par-
ticular interest because they are believed to form a back-
bone for the turbulent dynamics near the onset of tur-
bulence. Since the laminar proﬁle in these ﬂows is lin-
early stable for all Reynolds numbers [31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38] the transition cannot proceed through states
bifurcating from the laminar proﬁle. The turbulent mo-
tion which in many pipe-ﬂow experiments is observed for
Reynolds numbers beyond about 2000, must hence arise
via a nonlinear transition scenario [5, 9, 39, 40, 41, 42].
The travelling waves are then the simplest persistent non-
linear structures around which the turbulent dynamics
can form. Together with their stable and unstable man-
ifolds they can give rise to the basic building blocks of
chaotic dynamics, such as hyperbolic tangles and Smale
horseshoes. While it is unlikely that one will be able to
identify an individual travelling wave in a time series, it
is possible to identify a visit to their neighborhood, as
identiﬁed by the appearance of similar structures in the
ﬂow.

In the present paper we propose a way to detect the
visits to the neighborhoods of coherent states, and use it
to infer information about the structures underlying tur-
bulence. To distinguish diﬀerent parts of state space and
diﬀerent ﬂow topologies, we introduce projections onto
lower dimensional subspaces that capture salient features
of classes of coherent states, and study the recurrences
to these subspaces: This is weaker than identifying in-
dividual travelling waves but suﬃcient to discriminate
between various ﬂow regimes. On the technical side, the
reduction in resolution also lowers the requirements on
the length of the time traces and helps to improve the
statistical signiﬁcance.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. II we

tion used to detect and characterize the coherent struc-
tures in direct numerical simulations of pipe ﬂow close to
the threshold of turbulence. In Sect. IV we analyst the
statistics of the occurrence of coherent structures, and in
Sect. V we explore their physical properties. The paper
closes with a discussion and outlook in Sect. VI.

II. SIMULATION OF PIPE FLOW

We consider an incompressible Newtonian liquid in a
pipe of circular cross section subject to no-slip boundary
conditions at the walls. The ﬂow is forced by a uniform
pressure gradient which is adjusted to keep the ﬂux con-
stant at any instant of time [30, 43, 44]. In other words
the integrated volume ﬂux through a cross section of the
pipe is constant, and the Reynolds number

Re =

2huziR
ν

(1)

is externally controlled in order to be independent of the
ﬂow state of the liquid. Here huzi denotes the mean
downstream velocity, R is the pipe radius and ν the kine-
matic viscosity of the liquid. In our simulations the pipe
is L = 10R long, and we use periodic boundary condi-
tions in the downstream direction: physically, this corre-
sponds to a numerical representation of the interior of a
turbulent patch.

The Navier-Stokes equations are written in cylindrical
coordinates (r, ϕ, z) and solved with a pseudo-spectral
scheme. In doing so dimensionless units where lengths
are measured in units of the radius of the pipe and ve-
locities in units of twice the mean downstream velocity
(i.e., the centerline velocity of the equivalent parabolic
laminar proﬁle) are used. Time is measured in units of
R/2huzi.

All three components of the velocity ﬁeld (ur, uϕ, uz)
are decomposed into Fourier modes in azimuthal and
downstream direction. Chebyshev polynomials are used
for expansion in radial direction. The velocity ﬁeld is

FIG. 1: The coherent vortices are expected to be most promi-
nent in cross sections perpendicular to the pipe axis, as the
shaded plane in this ﬁgure. In experiments, the velocity ﬁelds
in this cross section are obtained by steroscopic particle image
velocimetry [30].

the velocity ﬁelds are represented by the values of the
ﬁelds at the corresponding Gauss-Lobatto grid points.

A 4th-5th-order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg scheme with
adaptive step-size control is used to evolve the solution
in time [47], and the action of the Navier-Stokes operator
is computed via a pseudo-spectral scheme. The transfor-
mation between spectral and physical space required by
the pseudo-spectral scheme is performed by FFT-based
routines. Constraints (incompressibility, regularity and
analyticity) as well as no-slip boundary conditions are
enforced by a Lagrangian projection mechanism [48].

The simulations presented in this work are carried out
with n Fourier modes in azimuthal and m Fourier modes
in downstream direction, where |n|
22 ≤ 1 . Conse-
quently, we consider up to 49 Fourier modes in azimuthal
and up to 45 in the downstream direction. 47 Cheby-
shev polynomials are used for the expansion in the radial
direction, adding up to 3 × 49 × 23 × 47 ≈ 1.6 × 105
components.

sponding streaks in the downstream velocity components.
The downstream vortices and streaks are most prominent
in cross sections of the pipe perpendicular to the axis. As
in the experiments [30], where stereoscopic particle im-
age velocimetry was used to extract the velocity ﬁelds,
we will focus on the velocity ﬁelds in cross sections per-
pendicular to the pipe axis (Fig. 1). For the travelling
waves it makes no diﬀerence whether we focus on one
cross section and follow the time evolution or whether we
freeze the ﬂow at one instance of time and move the cross
section along the axis. The same applies for a transient
in a ﬁxed cross section
appearance of these structures:
they will come and go, and in a frozen ﬂow they would
be present in some regions along the axis and absent in
others. In the analysis presented below we work, as in
the experiments, with the time evolution in cross sections
at a ﬁxed position in the lab frame. Typical examples of
cross sections with high- and low-speed streaks, i.e., of
regions of high and low downstream velocity, are shown
in Fig. 2. The structures are best visible when a reference
proﬁle is subtracted. In previous works [30] the laminar
proﬁle with equal mean velocity was subtracted. Here we
use the mean turbulent proﬁle. It is obtained as the av-
erage over azimuthal angle and time of the downstream
velocity at a ﬁxed radius.

A. Characterizing the symmetry of coherent states

As mentioned in the introduction the coherent trav-
elling waves identiﬁed so far have highly symmetric ar-
rangements of vortex pairs. By transporting fast liquid
from the center to the walls and slow liquid from the
wall to the center region, these pairs of vortices gener-
ate elongated regions of fast and slow moving liquid. We
therefore focus on the appearance of symmetric arrange-
ments of high- and low-speed streaks schematically in-

FIG. 3: (color online) Sketch of the regular arrangement of
high- (dark red) and low-speed (light blue) streaks in coherent
structures. When analyzed at a ﬁxed radial position close
to the wall (green dashed line at radius 0.81), all currently
known travelling-wave solutions show high-speed streaks that
are equidistantly arranged on the circumference, i.e., they
show an N -fold rotational symmetry. Typical states contain
N low speed streaks close to the center, and 2N high speed
streaks close to the wall [27]. However, also states containing
N low and N high speed streaks were found [29].

dicated in Fig. 3. The travelling waves also show that
the high-speed streaks close to the walls are fairly stable
and do not move much in the azimuthal direction over
one period. This simpliﬁes their detection amidst the
ﬂuctuations of the total velocity ﬁeld.

The rotational symmetry of the pipe entails that pat-
terns should be considered identical when they only diﬀer
by a global rotation around the pipe axis. A detector for
coherent states should take this into account and be in-
variant under global rotations. We therefore suggest to
use an azimuthal correlation of the downstream velocity
uz at a chosen radius r and axial position z,

C(φ) ≡ huz (r, ϕ, z) uz (r, ϕ + φ, z)iϕ ,

(4)

where h·iϕ denotes averaging over ϕ. By a straightfor-
ward calculation one veriﬁes that this correlation func-
tion is invariant under global rotations. Moreover, it re-
liably uncovers periodic structures in the azimuthal di-
rection.

Whenever the system approaches a coherent state
showing N high-speed streaks close to the wall, the cor-
relation function C(φ) shows N peaks separated by an
angular displacement 2π/N . In particular, the four-fold
structure of the downstream velocity ﬁeld, Fig. 2b results
in a clear four-fold structure of the correlation function,
which is shown in Fig. 4a. In addition to the autocor-
relation peak at φ = 0 the correlation function shows
peaks at φ = ± π
2 , π. Similarly, a ﬂow with a three-fold
symmetry gives rise to peaks at φ = 0, ± 2π
3 (cf. Fig. 4b).
By following C(φ) in time one can detect the lifetimes
of structures, their decay, and the subsequent emergence
of new patterns. An example is given in Fig. 5, which
shows the decay of a four-streak state and the emergence
of a six-streak state within about 1 pipe radius.

3 .

B. Automated structure detection

The correlation function C(φ) signals the proximity of
the ﬂow to a coherent state by evenly spaced peaks. Its
derivatives highlight both minima and maxima of the cor-
relation function (see Fig. 6) and emphasize ﬂow struc-
tures of comparable (azimuthal) streak gradients. Since
C(φ) is an even function in φ, its derivative is odd. It
should have an substantial overlap with the sine-function
of the appropriate periodicity. In order to automatically
detect evenly spaced maxima and in order to count their
number we therefore deﬁne the scalar measures ZN via
a scalar product of the derivative of the correlation func-
tion and sin(N φ) [54],

ZN (t) ≡ −

FIG. 5: (color online) Azimuthal correlation function plotted
as a function of downstream position in the pipe. One clearly
observes the transition form a four-streak state to a six-streak
state. The transition is quite sharp and happens within a
spatial range of a single pipe radius.

This reduction of information to a scalar quantity con-
tains one parameter, the radius r at which the correla-
tion functions are determined. For the Reynolds numbers
considered here we ﬁnd r = 0.81 to be convenient. At
this radius, which is indicated by a dashed green line in
Fig. 3, the coherent structures under investigation show
a pronounced regular arrangement of high-speed streaks.
By following time traces of ZN for diﬀerent N we can
study the prevalence of structures of certain multiplicity
and the transitions between them. Examples are given
in Fig. 6. The top frames show ∂φC(φ), the derivative
of the azimuthal correlator with respect to the angular
coordinate φ, as a function of the azimuthal coordinate φ
and the time t. The four-fold structures have eight zeros
in their derivative (from four maxima and four minima),
and the six-fold structures have twelve zeros. Parallel
nodal lines indicate the presence of these structures for
times of about ten natural time units.

The lower frames in Fig. 6 show the time evolution
of the corresponding scalar projectors ZN . The indica-
tor Z4 shows pronounced peaks when the four-fold sym-
metric patterns are observed in the correlation function
and Z6 peaks when the six-fold structures appear; con-
versely, one is small when the other one is large. One
also notes considerable ﬂuctuations due to the residual
background turbulence. In general, values of ZN smaller
than about 0.01 cannot be considered signiﬁcant indica-
tors of a structure and belong to background ﬂuctuations.
On the other hand, comparison of the top and bottom
frames in Fig. 6 suggests that a threshold ZN > 0.013
signiﬁes the presence of coherent structures with N -fold
symmetry.

Armed with this threshold, we collapse the scalar time
series ZN (t) for N = 2, . . . , 8 to a single discrete indi-

where N = 0 is assigned to cases where all ZN remain
below the threshold. The maximal value 8 is an empiri-
cal limit, in that states with eight or more vortices were
rarely realized.

IV. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE TIME
SERIES

Based on the time series ZN (t) we now explore the
statistical properties of the occurrence of coherent struc-
tures in pipe ﬂow. The aim of this statistical analysis is
twofold: we want to see how frequently structures of a
certain multiplicity are present and we want to study the
extend to which a Markov approximation can describe
the switching between states.

A. Probability distribution of coherent states

Fig. 7 shows the probabilities of detecting a coherent
state of N -fold symmetry in time series taken at diﬀerent
Reynolds numbers Re close to the transition to turbu-
lence. For Re = 2200 about 24% of all cross sections fall
into the categories N = 3, 4, 5, and 6. For Re = 2500,
the fraction decreases slightly to about 20%. This high
fraction explains the ease with which coherent structures
were picked out of experimental cross sections [30], and
underlines their signiﬁcance as building blocks of the tur-
bulence in the transition region.

With increasing Reynolds number the weight of states
with large N increases. These structures are much closer
to the walls where they give rise to steeper gradients in
radial and azimuthal direction and consequently larger
friction. As these structures have more spatial degrees of
freedom, it is less likely that they appear in perfect sym-
metry. Hence, their correlators have smaller amplitudes,
and it would be interesting in forthcoming work to probe
for the structures with a localized correlator.

B. Markov model for transitions

The typical persistence time of a pattern in Fig. 6 is
about 5 to 10 time units, and the transition between the
four-streak and six-streak state shown in Fig. 5 takes
about one time unit. When discretizing time in order to
describe the transitions between diﬀerent patterns, the
sampling time scale should therefore not be much longer
than about 5. Otherwise one misses states. On the other
hand, if the time steps are much shorter than unity, one
begins to probe the continuity of the time evolution. As
representative examples in this interval we explored the
discrete dynamics of discretized time sequences with a

time spacing of τ = 1.4 and of τ = 2.4. Since diﬀerent τ
lead to results which cannot be distinguished within our
error margins, we will in the following present data for
τ = 1.4 only.

By considering the underlying ﬂow at multiples of the

More than 10 000 independent snapshots (17 202 for
Re = 2200, and more than 15 000 snapshots at the higher
Re = 2350 and Re = 2500) were analyzed in our statis-
tics. For the lowest Reynolds number the N = 8 class is
observed only a single time, and it immediately relaxed
into the N = 0 state (cf. rightmost column of Tij). De-
spite its rare occurrence, the N = 8 state is included in
the analysis because its statistical weight increases with
Reynolds number: It reaches 0.4% at Re = 2500.

C.

Invariant distribution and life time of coherent

states

To check that the Markovian dynamics generated by
the transition matrices faithfully represents the continu-
ous dynamics, we ﬁrst calculate the invariant probability
distribution e, deﬁned as the eigenvector to the eigen-
value 1, i.e.

e = T e .

(8)

Fig. 7 shows that the eN faithfully reproduce the relative
frequencies in the original data. A comparison of the
histograms for the diﬀerent Re shows that the number
of visited coherent states and the complexity of the re-
sulting ﬂow patterns increase when the Reynolds number
increases.

Except for N = 8 the highest transfer probabilities
in each column appear along the diagonal of T . These
elements describe the persistence of ﬂow patters from
time step to time step. Therefore, the probability density
function p(N, n) to observe the pattern for n consecutive
time steps scales like

p(N, n) ∼ (TN N )n .

(9)

Fig. 8 shows data for the life time calculated from di-
rect numerical simulation of the ﬂow, together with
the prediction from the Markov model, which is shown

as straight lines in the semilogarithmic plot of
life-
times. Since long persistence times are exponentially
suppressed this comparison requires very long time se-
ries to check the prediction with reasonable statistical
accuracy. Within these limitations there is a very good
agreement between the data and the prediction.

V. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF DETECTED
STATES

The diﬀerent ﬂow patterns also aﬀect the diﬀerent ve-
locity and ﬂuctuation statistics. As examples we con-
sider the Reynolds stresses szz = huzuzi, srr = hururi
and szr = huzuri. Taking averages over φ, but not over
time, provides probability distribution function (pdf) of
temporal variations of these quantities (dashed lines in
Fig. 9 tagged as combined), as well as conditional pdfs
referring to states with a ﬁxed number of streaks (solid
lines tagged as state 3. . . state 6) and the turbulent un-
structured state (solid lines tagged as state 0). The over-
all pdf can thus be decomposed into contributions of the
previously discussed high-symmetry coherent states and
a turbulent remainder (state 0). To emphasize the role
played by the coherent states in changing the shape of the
distribution of the considered component of the Reynolds
stress the abscissa is always normalized to its overall tem-
poral average. For instance, szz is normalized by its av-
erage szz, and the resulting normalized stress is denoted
ˆszz = szz/szz. By deﬁnition the mean of the ˆszz distribu-
tion is therefore unity. However, the conditional pdfs for
speciﬁc states will in general have means diﬀerent from
one. If the mean is larger than one, the state shows —
on average — larger stress components than the tempo-
ral average value of the component. Table I lists both
the absolute and the normalized mean values of all pdfs
shown in Fig. 9.

A. PDFs at ﬁxed Re

From a physical point of view the interest of the de-
compositions of the total pdf into conditional ones for
turbulent and individual coherent states lies in the in-
sight it gives into how the coherent states contribute to
the exceptional statistics of ﬂuctuations in turbulent ﬂow.

FIG. 9: (color online) The axial velocity ﬂuctuations (top), radial velocity ﬂuctuations (middle), and radial momentum transport
(bottom) for ﬂows at Reynolds numbers Re = 2200 (left), Re = 2350 (center) and Re = 2500 (right). Diﬀerent lines refer
to the the overall time-averaged signal (dashed black, left axis), and the one averaged only over turbulent states, where no
streaks are detected (solid black, left axes). The lines in the other colors give the respective contributions of states with a
given number of streaks (right axis). The histograms are normalized with respect to their integral, i.e., the overall distribution
(dashed line) is normalized to unity, and all other distributions (given by solid lines) add up to the overall distribution. Their
norm consequently amounts to the weights shown in the histograms in Fig. 7, and the position of their maxima indicate for
which values they most strongly contribute to the overall signal.

We ﬁrst consider the decomposition of the pdfs at ﬁxed
Re, i.e., we discuss the trends in the mean of the data
shown in individual panels of Fig. 9.

On the average the detected coherent states generate
much stronger Reynolds stresses than those found for the
unstructured turbulent state 0. Consequently the coher-
ent states shift the means and the maxima of the com-
bined pdf to slightly larger values. Compared to the pdf
of state 0 (dashed black line) the coherent states add a
fat tail to the combined pdf (black solid line) on the side

of larger values of the stresses. In order to gain insight
into the mutual importance of the diﬀerent states we dis-
cuss the trends in the mean and maxima as a function of
the number of streaks N .

The normalized stress ˆszz characterizes the intensity
of streak structures in the ﬂow ﬁeld by estimating their
downstream velocity. The maxima and mean values of
its pdf decrease in the order N = 3, 4, 5 and 6. This can
be interpreted as follows: The product of typical gradi-
ents of uz with the length scale over which the gradients

disordered motion (state 0) and coherent states with N =
3 . . . 6 streaks, respectively. In addition also the corresponding
relative values ˆsij are given which are normalized with respect
to the overall temporal mean of the considered component of
the Reynolds stress. The related pdfs are shown in Fig. 9.

persist is of the order of magnitude of the typical velocity
ﬂuctuation in downstream direction. Consequently, the
azimuthal components of the gradients of uz are of the
same order of magnitude in all coherent states, and their
typical length scale decreases like N −1.

The radial component ˆsrr measures the typical ﬂuctu-
ations of the radial velocity component, i.e., it charac-
terizes the strength of the vortices. For this stress there
also is a clear trend in the position of the maxima and
mean values with N , but with the sequence reversed:
the highest value for the maximum appears for N = 6,
and it decreases towards N = 3. This ﬁnding suggests
that stronger vortices are needed to maintain the smaller
streaks in coherent states with larger N .

From a physical point of view the Reynolds stress szr is
the most interesting of the three quantities. After all, it
reﬂects the strength of the radial momentum transport.
Hence it provides direct insight in the friction factor in
the turbulent ﬂow [49], and it also immediately reﬂects
the role of the coherent states in the ﬂattening of the
laminar ﬂow proﬁle in radial direction. In view of the op-
posite scaling of the radial and axial velocity components
observed in ˆsrr and ˆszz, respectively, its N dependence
results from a most subtle balance.

teracting trends almost cancel, leaving only a very weak

B. Drift of the mean with Re

In order to explore how the components of the
Reynolds stress change with Reynolds number, and
which physical eﬀects generate the observed trends, one
observes that the mean ¯x of a combined pdf P (x) =
dx PN (x) = 1, and
dx P (x) = 1,
N eN PN (x) with
N eN = 1 is the weighted average of the means ¯xN of

In Fig. 9 the conditional pdfs eN PN (x) are plotted to-
gether with their sum P (x) for x = ˆszz, ˆsrr, and ˆszr,
respectively, and the abscissa is scaled such that ¯x = 1.
The shift in the mean of P (x) therefore arises as an av-
erage of the distance of the mean ¯xN from unity with
weights eN previously discussed in the framework of the
Markov model (cf. Fig. 7). There are two physical eﬀects
underlying the observed changes in the statistics with
Re: (1) the change of the mean of conditional pdfs of
the diﬀerent states, and (2) the change in the statistical
weights of the states. We will disentangle these contri-
butions now for the physically most interesting case of
szr.

Both visual inspection of the conditional pdf in Fig. 9
(bottom row), and the values of the normalized mean val-

10

T.M. Schneider, J. Vollmer, B. Eckhardt

ues in Table I show that there only is a slight drift of the
coherent states’ pdfs with Re. In contrast, as observed
upon discussing Fig. 7 their weights show pronounced
changes. The nontrivial evolution of their weights with
Re suggests that the coherent states contribute to the
change of the overall mean mainly by the change of their
statistical weights eN . This becomes particularly clear
when plotting the relative change ∆szr/szr of the posi-
tion of the mean when increasing Re from 2200 to 2350
and from 2350 to 2500, respectively (Fig. 10). In the ﬁrst
interval this change is dominated by the one of state 3
while state 6 hardly contributes, and in the latter interval
these two states take just the opposite roles.

We thus conclude that our statistical analysis allows us
to identify the contributions of individual coherent states
to the anomalous statistics of turbulent pipe ﬂow, and
to disentangle the changes with Re into changes of the
statistical weights of the states, and the comparatively
smaller ones due to the Re-dependence of the properties
of individual states. One can interpret these ﬁndings
as a hint that turbulent transients close to Re >
∼ 2000
are dominantly inﬂuenced by coherent states with only
few streaks. In contrast, at higher Re successively more
coherent states with larger number of streaks aﬀect the
time series.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this section we want to summarize the results from
the present simulation of pipe ﬂow and point to the parts
that could be useful in analyzing other shear ﬂows as well.
The automatic detection algorithm for coherent states,
which was ﬁrst used in [30] and was expanded on here, is
fairly robust. It can be generalized to other ﬂows as well.
The algorithm systematically searches for structures that
show a symmetric azimuthal arrangement of high-speed
streaks along the wall which is topologically very simi-
lar to the one observed in exact coherent states reported
in [27, 29, 30]. The detection is based on a Fourier-
mode decomposition of the radial velocity. Because the
detected states have the same symmetry structure also
in the other components of the velocity ﬁeld, the results
should be robust against details of the implementation of
the detector. Diﬀerent projectors constructed along the
line outlined in Sect. III should lead to identical results.
For extensions to larger Re it might, however, be valu-
able to consider extensions to asymmetric expansions of
the ﬂow ﬁeld, e.g. by using wavelet [50, 51] or Gabor
[52, 53] representations to extract basic units of coherent
structures which contain only a single pair of vortices.

In principle, one can obtain more highly resolved and
more accurate information about the statistical proper-
ties of the ﬂow by including more degrees of freedom
and subsequent extensions of the subspace of projection.
In practice, however, the reﬁnements are limited by the
available data set, because more degrees of freedom re-
quire many more data points in order to guarantee sta-

tistically reliable results.

Irrespective of the chosen detector, the present method
can be used to quantitatively analyze coherent structures
in turbulent ﬂow: the automatic projectors give infor-
mation about the probability to observe certain coherent
structures, their lifetimes, and the transitions between
these diﬀerent states. A number of observations can thus
be made:

1. Despite being unstable the coherent states carry
a considerable statistical weight of ≃ 20%. This shows
that even though the states are linearly unstable, they
inﬂuence the ﬂow for a considerable part of its evolution.
These numbers explain a posteriori why the states could
be observed in the experiments by Hof et al [30].

2. Upon increasing Re from 2200 to 2500 the combined
statistical weight of all detected coherent states decreases
only weakly. However, there is a clear shift towards states
with a larger number of streaks.

3. Due to their prevalence the coherent states sig-
niﬁcantly inﬂuence the turbulent dynamics at low Re.
This opens a route to modelling turbulence by explor-
ing dynamical interconnections between coherent states.
To this end we considered the dynamics as a random
walk between a limited number of coherent states, and
extracted the transfer probabilities between states from
the numerical time series. The predictions of the Markov
dynamics agree very well with the numerically observed
frequency of occurrence and the life time of the coherent
states.

4. The decomposition of the Reynolds stresses into
contributions arising from irregular motion and contri-
butions from coherent states with three, four, ﬁve and
six high-speeds streaks allowed us to study the contri-
bution of diﬀerent structures to the radial momentum
transport. Trends in the changes of the radial momen-
tum transport with Re could be explained in terms of
substantial changes of the individual dynamical impor-
tance (statistical weights) of the states while the proper-
ties of individual states change only slightly. Both eﬀects
could be separated based on our statistical analysis.

We conclude that the methods presented in the present
paper can be used to quantitatively analyze and describe
turbulent dynamics close to the transition to turbulence.
Obviously, they can be extended to projectors providing a
still more detailed characterization of the ﬂow and used in
other ﬂows as well. Since the approach does not make use
of speciﬁc features of our numerical setup, it should be
applicable to the analysis of numerical and experimental
data alike.

The nonlinear dynamics of charged-surface instability development was investigated
for liquid helium far above the critical point. It is found that, if the surface charge
completely screens the ﬁeld above the surface, the equations of three-dimensional (3D)
potential motion of a ﬂuid are reduced to the well-known equations describing the 3D
Laplacian growth process. The integrability of these equations in 2D geometry allows
the analytic description of the free-surface evolution up to the formation of cuspidal
singularities at the surface.

It is known [1] that the ﬂat electron-charged surface of liquid helium is unstable if the

electric ﬁeld strength above (E+) and inside (E−) the ﬂuid satisfy inequality

E+

2 + E−

2 > Ec

2 = 8π√gαρ,

2)/Ec

2−E+

where g is the free fall acceleration, α is the surface tension coeﬃcient, and ρ is the ﬂuid
density. An analysis of the critical behavior of the system suggests that, depending on the
2, the nonlinearity leads either to the saturation
dimensionless parameter S = (E−
of linear instability or, conversely, to the explosive increase in amplitude. The ﬁrst situation
may result in the formation of a stationary perturbed surface relief (hexagons [2] and many-
electron dimples [3]) in liquid helium. The use of a perturbation theory, with the surface slope
as a small parameter, allowed the detailed analytic study of such structures in the critical
region [4,5]. In the second case, the small-angle approximation fails. The cinematographic
study by V.P. Volodin, M.S. Khaikin, and V.S. Edelman [6] has demonstrated that the
development of surface instability leads to the formation of dimples and their sharpening in
a ﬁnite time. A substantial nonlinearity of this processes calls for a theoretical model that is
free from the requirement for smallness of surface perturbations and adequately describes the
formation dynamics of a singular surface proﬁle in liquid helium. This work demonstrates
that such a model can be developed if the condition E− ≫ E+ is fulﬁlled, i.e., the ﬁeld
above liquid helium is fully screened by the surface electron charge, and if the electric ﬁeld
far exceeds its critical value, i.e., E− ≫ Ec.
Let us consider the potential motion of an ideal ﬂuid (liquid helium), in a region bounded
by the free surface z = η(x, y, t). We assume that the characteristic scale λ of surface
perturbations is much smaller than the ﬂuid depth. We also assume that

so that the capillary and gravity eﬀects can be ignored. The electric-ﬁeld potential ϕ(x, y, z, t)
in the medium and the ﬂuid velocity potential Φ(x, y, z, t) satisfy Laplace equations

Let us pass to the dimensionless variables, taking λ as a length unit, E− as a unit of
electric ﬁeld strength, and λE −1
It is convenient to rewrite the
equations of motion of free surface z = η(x, y, t) in the implicit form (not containing the η
function explicitly). Let us introduce the perturbed potential ˜ϕ = ϕ + z decaying at inﬁnity.
It is then straightforward to obtain the following

Let now introduce a pair of auxiliary potentials:

z = η(x, y, t).

With these potentials, the ﬂuid surface shape can be deﬁned by relationship

φ(±)(x, y, z, t) = ( ˜ϕ ± Φ)/2.

while equations of motion (1)–(6) are reduced to the following symmetric form:

where boundary conditions (11) are obtained by combining Eqs. (7) and (8) with plus and
minus sign, respectively.

It is seen that the equations of motion are split into two systems of equations for the
potentials φ(+) and φ(−), which are implicitly related by equation for surface shape (9).
An essential point is that these equations are compatible with either φ(−) = 0 or φ(+) =
0 condition. One can readily see that the ﬁrst condition corresponds to those solutions

2

whose amplitude increases with time, while the second condition corresponds to the decaying
solutions that are of no interest to us.

Thus, an analysis of the equations of motion of a charged surface of liquid helium reveals
a solution increasing with t and corresponding to the φ(−) = 0 condition or, what is the same,
to the ϕ + z = Φ condition (the stability of this branch of solutions is proved below). The
functional relation between the potentials can be used to eliminate the velocity potential Φ
from initial Eqs. (1)–(6). In the moving system of coordinates {x′, y′, z′} = {x, y, z − t}, one
has
(13)

∇2ϕ = 0,

(14)

(15)

η′

t = ∂nϕq1 + (∇⊥η′)2,

z′ = η′(x′, y′, t).

ϕ = 0,
ϕ → −z′,

z′ = η′(x′, y′, t)
z′ → −∞,

(16)
where η′(x′, y′, t) = η − t, and ∂n denotes the normal derivative. These equations explicitly
describe the motion of a free charged surface z′ = η′(x′, y′, t). They coincide with the
equations for the so-called Laplacian growth process, i.e., the phase boundary movement
with velocity directly proportional to the normal derivative of a certain scalar ﬁeld (ϕ in
our case). Depending on the system, this may be the temperature (Stefan problem in the
quasi-stationary limit), the electrostatic potential (electrolytic deposition), the pressure (ﬂow
through a porous medium), etc.

Note that the boundary movement described by Eqs. (13)–(16) is invariably directed
inward from the surface. Let η′ be a single-valued function of variables x′ and y′ at zero time
t = 0. Then the inequality η′(x′, y′, t) ≤ η′(x′, y′, 0) holds for t > 0. In the initial notations,
(17)

η(x, y, t) ≤ η(x, y, 0) + t

for any x and y. This condition can be used to prove the stability of the ascending branch to
the small perturbations of potential φ(−). Clearly, the boundary motion at small φ(−) values
is entirely controlled by the potential φ(+) [one should set φ(−) = 0 in Eq. (9)] and, hence,
obeys Eqs. (13)–(16). The evolution of the φ(−) potential is described by Eqs. (10)–(12),
with the following simple boundary condition in the linear approximation:

Let the potential distribution at zero time t = 0 be determined by the expression

φ(−)
t = −φ(−)

z

,

z = η(x, y, t).

φ(−)|t=0 = φ0(x, y, z),

where φ0 is a harmonic function at z ≤ η(x, y, 0) decaying at z → −∞. It is then straight-
forward to show that the time dynamics of the φ(−) potential is given by

This implies that the singularities of the φ(−) function will drift in the z direction, so that
they will occur only in the z > η(x, y, 0) + t region. Taking into account inequality (17),

φ(−) = φ0(x, y, z − t).

3

one ﬁnds that the singularities always move away from the boundary z = η(x, y, t) of liquid
helium. Consequently, the perturbation φ(−) will relax to zero, as we wished to prove.

Let us now turn to the analysis of the dynamics of surface instability development in
liquid helium. In the 2D case (all quantities are taken to be independent of the y variable),
system of Eqs. (13)–(16) is reduced to the well-known Laplacian growth equation (see, e.g.,
[7] and references therein):

Im(f ∗

t fw) = 1,

ϕ = 0.

In this expression, f = x′ + iz′ is a complex function analytical in the lower half-plane of
the complex variable w = ψ − iϕ and satisfying condition f → w at w → ψ − i∞. Note
that the ψ function is a harmonic conjugate to ϕ, while the condition ψ = const deﬁnes the
electric ﬁeld lines in a medium. The Laplacian growth equation is integrable in the sense
that it allows for the inﬁnite number of partial solutions:

f (w) = w − it − i

N

Xn=1

an ln (w − wn(t)) + i  N
Xn=1

an! ln (w − ˜w(t)) ,

where an are complex constants and Im(wn) > 0. The last term is added in order that
the condition η → 0 be fulﬁlled at |x| → ∞. One can put Im( ˜w) ≫ Im(wn); in this case,
the inﬂuence of this term on the surface evolution can be ignored. The functions wn(t) are
deﬁned by the following set of transcendental equations [7]:

wn + it + i

N

Xm=1

a∗
m ln (wn − w∗

m) = Cn,

where Cn are arbitrary complex constants.

Let us consider the simplest (N = 1) solution to the Laplacian growth equation:

f (w) = w − it + i ln(w − ir(t)),

r(t) − ln r(t) = 1 + tc − t,

(18)

where tc is a real constant and the real function r(t) ≥ 1. The shape of a solitary perturbation
corresponding to Eqs. (18) is given parametrically by expressions

z(ψ, t) = lnqψ2 + r2(t),

x(ψ, t) = ψ − arctan (ψ/r(t)) .

(19)

This solution exists only during a ﬁnite time period and culminates in the formation, at time
t = tc, of a singularity in the form of a ﬁrst-kind cusp at the ﬂuid surface. Indeed, setting
r = r(tc) = 1 in Eq. (19), one obtains

2z = |3x|2/3

in the leading order near the singular point (see also [8]). Note that the electric ﬁeld turns
to inﬁnity at the cusp:

The surface velocity also becomes inﬁnite in a ﬁnite time:

∂nϕ ∼ x−1

ψ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ψ=0 ∼ 1/√tc − t.
ηt = zt|ψ=0 ∼ 1/√tc − t.

4

It is worth noting that the singular solution in the leading order is also true when the ﬁeld
above the surface is screened incompletely. The point is that the requirement that the ﬁeld
above the surface be small compared to the ﬁeld in ﬂuid is naturally satisﬁed in the vicinity
of the singularity.

Let now discuss the inﬂuence of the capillary eﬀects. One can readily estimate the surface

and electrostatic pressures near the surface:

αR−1 ∼ αρ1/2E −1

− (tc − t)−1,

(∂nϕ)2 ∼ λρ1/2E− (tc − t)−1.

Insofar as we assumed that λ ≫ αE −2
− , the capillary forces cannot compete with the elec-
trostatic ones, so that there is no need to take into account the surface forces at the stage
of cusp formation.

In summary, we succeeded in ﬁnding a broad class of exact solutions to the equations
of motion of a charged surface of liquid helium.
It is remarkable that the solutions ob-
tained are not constrained by the condition for the smallness of surface perturbations: the
model suggested describes the free-surface instability development up to the formation of
the singularities (cusps) similar to those observed in the experiment [6].

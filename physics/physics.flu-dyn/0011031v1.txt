In the limit of low viscosity, we show that the amplitude of the modes of oscillation of a rotating ﬂuid,
namely inertial modes, concentrate along an attractor formed by a periodic orbit of characteristics of
the underlying hyperbolic Poincar´e equation. The dynamics of characteristics is used to elaborate
a scenario for the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenmodes and eigenspectrum in the physically
relevant r´egime of very low viscosities which are out of reach numerically. This problem oﬀers a
canonical ill-posed Cauchy problem which has applications in other ﬁelds.

Rotating ﬂuids encompass all ﬂuids whose motions are
dominated by the Coriolis force. These ﬂows play an
important role in astrophysics or geophysics where the
large size of the bodies makes the Coriolis force a promi-
nent force. Some engineering problems like the stability
of artiﬁcial satellites also require the study of rotating
ﬂuids because of their liquid-ﬁlled tanks [1]. This latter
problem is related to the existence of waves speciﬁc to
rotating ﬂuids, namely inertial waves, which easily res-
onate. These waves play also an important part in the
oscillation properties of large bodies like the atmosphere,
the oceans, the liquid core of the Earth [2], rapidly rotat-
ing stars [3] or neutron stars [4]. As such, they have been
considered since the work of Poincar´e on the stability of
ﬁgures of equilibrium of rotating masses [5]. Pressure
perturbations of inertial modes for inviscid ﬂuids obey
the Poincar´e equation (PE) (christened by Cartan [6])
(2Ω/ω)−2∂2P/∂z2 = 0 where Ω~ez is
which reads ∆P
the angular velocity of the ﬂuid and ω is the frequency
of the oscillation. Since ω < 2Ω [7], the PE is hyper-
bolic (energy propagates along characteristics) and since
its solutions must meet boundary conditions, the prob-
lem is ill-posed mathematically. Although some smooth
solutions exist (for instance for a ﬂuid contained in a
full sphere or a cylinder), one should expect singular so-
lutions in the general case. These latter solutions have
been made explicit only recently thanks to numerical sim-
ulations which include viscosity to regularize the singu-
larities and let this parameter be very small as in real
systems [8,9].

In this letter we wish to present a scenario, based on
analytical and numerical results, for the asymptotic be-
haviour of inertial modes at small viscosities. We use the
case of a spherical shell as a container, which is relevant
for astrophysical or geophysical problems, but it will be
clear that this case is general. We will only sketch the
main results, more details can be found in [9]. While
the ﬂuid mechanical problem is of much interest by it-
self, it opens new perspectives in the theory of Partial

Diﬀerential Equations (PDE) and also oﬀers a toy model
for some (very involved) problems of General Relativity
which we shall present brieﬂy.

The model we use is a spherical shell whose inner radius
is ηR and outer radius R (η < 1). The ﬂuid is assumed
incompressible with a kinematic viscosity ν. We write
the linearized equations of motion for small amplitude
perturbations for the velocity ~u in a frame corotating
with the ﬂuid; momentum and mass conservation imply:

use boundary layer theory and singular perturbations to
solve (1). However, this is feasible only when regular so-
lutions exist for E = 0; this is the case when the container
is a full sphere [7] but not when the container is a spheri-
cal shell. Indeed, numerical solutions of the eigenvalue
problem issued from (1), where solutions of the form

yield eigenmodes of the kind shown in Fig. 1.
In this
ﬁgure we see that the amplitude of the mode is all con-
centrated along a periodic orbit of characteristics of the
PE; we found this property to be quite general, after ex-
tensive numerical exploration of least-damped modes of
(1) [8,9], and will now explain its origin and consequences
on the asymptotic spectrum of inertial modes. For this
purpose we will use axisymmetric modes since the az-
imuthal dependence of solutions can always be separated
out because of the axial symmetry of the problem.

For understanding the concentration of kinetic energy
along a periodic orbit of characteristics, it is necessary
to consider in some details the dynamics of these lines.
Characteristics of PE are, in a meridional plane, straight
lines making the angle arcsin ω with the rotation axis.
A numerical calculation of their trajectories shows that

they generally converge towards a periodic orbit which
we call, after [10], an attractor. The periodic orbit of
Fig. 1 is one example of such an attractor.

the opposite of the one described by the KAM theorem in
Hamiltonian systems: when the full sphere is perturbed
by the introduction of an inner sphere, all ergodic orbits
are instantaneously destroyed while the longer periodic
orbits survive the smaller the denominator q is.

shell of an inertial mode in a viscous ﬂuid. For this numerical

solution, E = 10
shev polynomials have been used (the numerical method is
described in [8]). The mode is axisymmetric and symmetric
with respect to equator. η = 0.35 like in the Earth’s core. ω is
the frequency of this mode and τ its damping rate. Stress-free
boundary conditions are used. The convergence of character-
istics towards the attractor is also shown (white lines).

tics are attracted or repelled. Its computation as a func-
tion of frequency shows that attractors (Λ < 0) are ubiq-
uitous in frequency space (see Fig. 2). Their existence
shows that the dynamical system described by the char-
acteristics is not hamiltonian; the “dissipation” is purely
geometrical and is due to the fact that, unlike billiards,
the reﬂection on boundaries is not specular but conserves
the angle with the rotation axis. In fact, the dynamics
of rays is a one-to-one one-dimensional map (from the
outer boundary to itself), piecewise smooth, but with a
ﬁnite number (twelve) of discontinuities. This kind of
map has not been studied in the literature of dynami-
cal systems, perhaps because it does not produce chaos
because of its invertibility. Iterations of such a map gen-
erate ﬁxed points which either correspond to attractors
or to some neutral periodic orbits. Indeed, if η = 0 (i.e.
the sphere is full), all orbits such that ω = sin(pπ/2q)
IN2, are neutral and periodic while those
with (p, q)
such that ω = sin(rπ), r being irrational, are neutral
ergodic (quasiperiodic). When η is non-zero only a ﬁ-
nite number of such neutral periodic orbits subsist; for
instance, if η = 0.35 which is the aspect ratio of the
Earth’s liquid core, q = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the only possibili-
ties. Interestingly, we face here a situation which is just

Apart from these isolated frequencies which become
rarer and rarer as η increases, generic trajectories are in
the basin of attraction of attractors. We were able to
show [9] that the number of attractors at a given fre-
quency is ﬁnite. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the typical
case where an attractor exists in a frequency band [ω1, ω2]

The existence of attractors for characteristics implies
that solutions of the inviscid problem (i.e. of PE) are
singular. This property can be made explicit in the sim-
pliﬁed case of a 2D problem.
Indeed, in this case the
PE may be written ∂2P/∂u+∂u− = 0 using characteris-
tics coordinates; solutions may be constructed explicitly
from an arbitrary function but, as shown in [11], regular
eigenmodes exist only when neutral periodic orbits exist
and eigenvalues are inﬁnitely degenerate. When attrac-
tors are present, the scale of variations of the pressure
vanishes on the attractors while its amplitude remains
constant. As velocity depends on the pressure gradient,
it diverges on the attractor; this divergence is like the
inverse of the distance to the attractor which makes the
velocity ﬁeld not square integrable. This result seems to
be valid also in 3D [9].

We therefore understand why solutions of (1) look like
Fig. 1: the inviscid part of the operator focuses energy of

2

the modes thanks to the action of the mapping made by
characteristics while viscosity opposes to this action via
diﬀusion. The resulting picture of Fig. 1 therefore comes
from a balance between inviscid terms and viscous ones;
let us make this more quantitative.

line is ω −ωi as a function of E, while the dotted line is for the
damping rate τ . The solid line represents the ‘theoretical’ law
E1/2. ωi = 0.403112887 is a root of Λ(ω) = 0 when η = 0.35.

For this purpose we ﬁrst observe that the patterns
drawn by the kinetic energy of the mode in Fig. 1 is in
fact a shear layer whose width scale with Eσ and σ
1/4.
Such a scaling is observed numerically and seems generic
[8,9];
it implies that the damping rate of such modes
scales like E1/2 as clearly shown in Fig. 3. Now we may
consider a wave packet travelling around an attractor in
a slightly viscous ﬂuid. The above mentioned balance,
when applied to both the width and the amplitude of
the packet, leads to a relation between the LE and the
E1−3σ with σ < 1/3 for an
Ekman number such as Λ
∼
eigenmode of the viscous problem. We see that the con-
straint σ < 1/3 is met by actual shear layers. It therefore
turns out that frequencies of eigenmodes of the viscous
problem are such that Λ
0 which means
that they will gather around the roots of the equation
Λ(ω) = 0.

The above result shows the importance of the scal-
ing veriﬁed by shear layers. A boundary layer analysis
reveals that these shear layers are in fact nested layers
which consist of an inner σ = 1/3-layer surrounded by a
thicker layer. The inner 1/3-layer can be fully explicited.
Using coordinates along the shear layers (x) and perpen-
dicular to it (y), we ﬁnd that the ϕ-component of the
velocity veriﬁes ∂3uϕ

only admissible value to ensure a coherent evolution of

In addition, we noticed earlier that for a ﬁnite number
of ω such that ω = sin(pπ/2q) all orbits of characteristics
are periodic; this implies that in the vicinity of these fre-
quencies very long attractors with very small average LE
accumulate as shown by Fig. 4; therefore, these frequen-
cies will be accumulation points of the asymptotic spec-
trum. Moreover, around these frequencies eigenmodes
are weakly damped. On the contrary, modes whose fre-
quency is in the frequency band of short attractors (like
the one of Fig. 1) are more strongly damped. It there-
fore turns out that the LE curve in Fig. 2 will strongly
constrain the distribution of least-damped modes in the
complex plane at ﬁnite viscosities: such modes will avoid
the large frequency bands of short-period attractors and
concentrate around frequencies where Λ(ω) = 0 espe-
cially those with ω = sin(pπ/2q).

This general evolution of the spectrum is well illus-
trated in Fig. 5. Here, the least-damped eigenvalues have
been computed for E = 10−8. We clearly see frequency
bands of attractors avoided by weakly damped eigenval-
ues but see the gathering of these eigenvalues around
sin(π/4) and, but less conspicuously, around sin(π/6).

point in the asymptotic spectrum. Note the lengthening of
the attractors as π/6 is approached. Here η = 0.35.

To complete the picture, we need now mentioning that
a few regular modes survive among all these singulari-
ties; such modes are purely toroidal modes or r-modes
[13] which are non-axisymmetric. They avoid the con-

Relativity and the problem of “closed timelike curves”
(CTC), that is the problem of the existence of physical
systems which permit travels backward in time. Such
systems like wormholes have been studied by various au-
thors [17]; they set many problems among which that of
causality. Such a problem is also at the origin of the ill-
posedness of the Poincar´e problem and we showed that
it leads to many kinds of singularities.

We therefore see that inertial oscillations of a ﬂuid in-
side a container oﬀers a paradigm which may guide our
intuition for problems in other ﬁelds of physics which are
also ill-posed Cauchy problems.

Ending this letter, it is worth emphasizing the role
of the geometrical approach allowed by the dynamics of
characteristics, for describing the asymptotic properties
of inertial modes; in the domain of very low Ekman num-
bers (10−10
10−20), typical of astrophysical or geo-
physical ﬂuids, these modes are out of reach numerically.
The foregoing presentation shows that inertial modes
display a very rich dynamical behavior which comes from
the ill-posedness of the underlying inviscid problem. Here
we discussed the case of the spherical shell, but our re-
sults are general and can be extended to any container;
this is important since natural containers are usually not
perfect geometrical objects. Hence, fortunately, a curve
like Fig. 2 is structurally stable (see our discussion rela-
tive to the core of the Earth in [2]).

We note that the relevance of attractors has also been
shown experimentally in stratiﬁed ﬂuids [14]. Some con-
ﬁgurations of conducting ﬂuids bathed by a magnetic
ﬁeld, obeying the PE, will also display attractors [15].
These properties are in fact very general and extend to
mixed-type PDE as illustrated by the case of gravito-
inertial modes [16]. We think that similar results should
hold for systems which are solutions of PDE of hyper-
bolic or mixed type meeting boundary conditions. As an
example, our results may have applications in General

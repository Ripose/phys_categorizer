Abstract

We discuss the statistical properties of a single vortex line in a perfect ﬂuid. The
partition function is calculated up to the end in the thin vortex approximation.
It
turns out that corresponding theory is renormalizable, and the renormalization law
for the core size of the vortex is found. The direction of renormalization group ﬂow
makes the thin vortex approximation to be valid for the interest cases and this result
does not depend on the choice of infrared regularization. The expressions for some
gauge-invariant correlators are obtained to demonstrate the developed formalism at
work.

1 Introduction.

Is it relevant to say that the phenomenon of turbulence is possible in a perfect ﬂuid? How
much is important for the turbulence to be realized that real liquid has viscosity? We do
not have the answers based on the theoretical analysis yet.

One of the intrinsic properties of a perfect ﬂuid is the existance of an inﬁnite number of
integrals of motion providing the lines of vorticity to be frozen in a liquid (see for example
[1], [2] and references therein). The ”freezing” means the possibility to mark every vortex
line in such a way that these lines are deforming with time, but the labeling remains always
the same.

Taking a volume element of a liquid, ﬁlled by vortex lines densely and attempting to
move one of its parts with respect to another, one can feel the resistance to this motion
because of the quasi-Coulomb interaction between vortices. That is the turbulent viscosity.
It seems to be that the fundamental viscosity is not important provided there is a lot of
vortices in the volume element and they are packaged densely — the main contribution to
turbulent viscosity is due to the interaction between vortices. Small fundamental viscosity
should result in the violation of ”freezing” condition: the conservation of integrals freezing
lines of vorticity will be destroyed with time. But if the time of mixing is much less than the
time on which these integrals of motion are changing essentially, then the liquid is eﬀectively
ideal [3].

Nevertheless, the other eﬀect depending strongly on the value of fundamental viscosity
becomes important in this case. That is the formation of ﬁnite - time singularities in the
solutions of equations of motion for smooth initial conditions. The formation of such sin-
gularities really may take place for the Euler equation (see for example [4]). As for the
Navier-Stokes equation, the situation is not clear yet. We shall not take into consideration
the question about ﬁnite-time singularities in the present work.

The following program seems to be natural when the theoretical analysis of the situation
is absent. First, we have develop the theory of the statistical hydrodynamics in the case of
a perfect ﬂuid and to calculate the measurable quantities such as simple correlators. Then,
we should compare the theoretical predictions and experimental results. From this point of
view the problem of statistical dynamics of a single vortex line in a perfect ﬂuid seems to
be relevant. Two ways to its solution are known: the approach developed in Refs. [5] - [9]
consists in postulating Gibbs-like statistics for a vortex, and the other approach is realised
in the Ref. [3], where the probability of a closed vortex line carrying the vorticity Ω to be
within a small tube surrounding some contour γ is calculated.

It was too hard to advance further than obtaining the results of qualitative nature [8]
within the framework of the ﬁrst approach. Eﬀectively the diﬃculties are due to the necessity
to calculate the generating functional for nonlocal quantum ﬁeld theory. In the present work
we have calculated the generating functional completely in the thin vortex approximation.
It has been found that corresponding eﬀective theory is renormalizable, and the direction of

renormalization group ﬂow makes the thin vortex approximation to be valid. The expressions
for correlators connecting both approaches for the solution of the problem have also been
obtained.

The Hamiltonian of a single vortex in perfect ﬂuid has the following form

H = m0

here ξ is a parameter along the vortex line, components of ~R (ξ) are coordinates of the vortex
in the space, and m0 is some constant with dimension of energy per unit length.

Keeping in mind the problem of statistical dynamics of a vortex and following the Refs.

[5] - [9], we can write the partition function

Z =

D∗ ~R exp (

βH)

−

Z

Here the ”star” in the measure of functional integral means that it is necessary to take
into account an invariance of the Hamiltonian (1) with respect to the gauge transformation
˜ξ = f (ξ), where f is an arbitrary function. The theory deﬁned by the Hamiltonian (1) is
strongly nonlocal, and the functional integral (2) is essentially non-Gaussian, so it can be
hardly calculated up to the end. It turns out that it is possible to drastically simplify the

following. Let us imagine that the ”temperature” in the system 1/β is small enough for the
vortex to be deviated slightly from its equilibrium state. Then the main contribution to the
ξ1, and the energy of the vortex
integral on ξ2 from (1) is given by the region, where ξ2 ∼
appears to be proportional to its length with the logarithmic accuracy:

Here l is the core size of the vortex, Λ is a typical size of the system in the case of an open
vortex line or the length of a vortex provided that it is closed.

It is convenient for us to expand the scope of applicability of the local induction approx-
imation changing the initial theory as follows (see the Ref. [4], but there is the opposite sign
of α):

H = m0

(the dimension of m0 varies correspondingly). This approximation is relevant because all the
energy of a vortex is concentrated in its core now, and the less the thickness of a core, the
better it works. Actually it is possible for such modiﬁed theory to permit strong ﬂuctuations,
if a vortex is thin enough. The dynamics of l also becomes unimportant in this case — the

waves moving along the vortex and seeking to smooth a non-uniformity in the distribution
of the thickness of the vortex line, have a speed, which is proportional to 1/l.

The answer for the partition function can be received from the lattice representation [10]

of the theory without direct calculation of the functional integral. We have on the lattice

where m = m0β
α , cL/a is the number of paths with length L on the lattice with the unit
cell of characteristic size a, the constant c depends on the concrete form of the lattice, the
summation is performed over all conﬁgurations of the vortex line with length L.

As it is easy to see, this theory is remormalizable: the equation of a renormalization
group is the independence condition of the partition function from the parameters of the
lattice

Generally speaking, m can depend on the length of a vortex, as it takes place in (3), and
it should be the absence of its renormalization. Thus, the physical (observed) thickness of
the vortex lph depends on the ultraviolet cut-oﬀ in the following way:

The calculation of the partition function (2) performed without engaging the lattice

and the value a has the same sense, as for the lattice representation. As it is easy to see, the
renormalization law for the thickness of a vortex (it can be found from the requirement of a
ﬁniteness of µ) is similar to (7).

3 Gauge-invariant correlators.

Here it will be shown how this formalism is connected with approach developed in [3]. Let
us calculate the probability for a vortex line to pass through a prescribed set of points
( ~R1, . . . , ~RN ). The physical meaning of this quantity is very close to the meaning of prob-
abilistic measure introduced in [3] — the probability for a vortex line to be within some
volume element V . This probability F is also important because of its universality: various
physical quantities can be expressed in terms of F . We have [10]

4 Summary.

We have discussed some statistical properties of a single vortex line under the proposal that
its probabilistic measure is Gibbs-like ([5] - [9]). The partition function is calculated up
to the end in the thin vortex approximation. It turned out that the corresponding theory
is renormalizable. The remormalization law for the core size of a vortex line has been
calculated, and the expressions for some gauge-invariant correlators have been obtained to
show the thin vortex approximation at work.

What is the meaning of these results? First, it is easy to see from the representation of
renormalization law (7) that if the local induction approximation works well for the physical
thickness lph, then it works even better for the ”naked” thickness l from the Hamiltonian (4).
The following condition should be satisﬁed for our calculation of the number of conﬁgurations
in (5) to be correct:

α log c
m0βa ≤
Then, it is possible to make more strong statement: the local induction approximation works
practically always for the ”naked” thickness of the vortex l, even when its using is not relevant
for the physical thickness lph. In fact, all the interest cases of vortex structures should lay
in the scope of applicability of this representation.

Second, the direction of renormalization group ﬂow does not depend on the type of
infrared regularization. The only thing we need to know is that there is the ”core” of our
vortex — a transverse (with respect to the vortex line) scale where the energy of the vortex is
localized, then the thin vortex approximation can be used to calculate the partition function
and correlators.

Thus, these results have the remarkable properties of universality.

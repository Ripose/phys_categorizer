Abstract

The inﬂuence of small additive noise on structure formation near a forwards and near an inverted

bifurcation as described by a cubic and quintic Ginzburg Landau amplitude equation, respectively,

is studied numerically for group velocities in the vicinity of the convective-absolute instability

where the deterministic front dynamics would empty the system.

INTRODUCTION

2

The formation of macroscopic structures [1] in systems that are driven out of thermal

equilibrium by an externally imposed generalized stress are usually investigated by deter-

ministic ﬁeld equations. However, under speciﬁc circumstances the inﬂuence of external

deterministic or stochastic perturbations and of internal thermal noise on the pattern for-

mation process should be taken into account to achieve a more realistic and quantitative

description of experiments. One prominent example are the so-called noise sustained struc-

tures [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] in the convectively unstable parameter regime

[15, 16] in, e.g., the Taylor-Couette [3, 4, 7, 8, 9], the Rayleigh-B´enard [5, 6, 12] system,

or nonlinear optics [13]. Further examples are certain open-ﬂow instabilities , e.g., in wakes

and jets that are reviewed in [16].

The noise sustained structures [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] arise when an

externally imposed through-ﬂow or an internally generated group velocity v is large enough

to ”blow” the pattern out of the system according to the deterministic ﬁeld equations. In

this driving regime one observes in experiments [3, 4, 6, 12, 13] structures that are sustained

by sources that generate perturbations in the band of modes that are ampliﬁed according

to the supercritical deterministic growth dynamics in downstream direction suﬃciently far

away from the inlet.

The criterion [15, 16] at which v the pattern is blown out of the system under determin-

istic laws which gave the threshold for the appearance of the noise sustained, supercritically

bifurcating patterns in the above described experiments is a linear one. It was nonlinearly

extended by Chomaz [17] to the question of the propagation direction of nonlinear determin-

istic fronts in inﬁnite systems that connect the unstructured state to the ﬁnite-amplitude

structured one.

Here we study and compare the noise sensitivity of pattern forming systems in which the

above described fronts are linear or nonlinear ones. To that end we investigate the cubic

Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation (GLE) for a supercritical forwards bifurcation and the

quintic GLE for a subcritical inverted bifurcation, respectively, in one spatial dimension.

We solve the GLE with additive stochastic forcing numerically. Our systems are ﬁnite but

suﬃciently long to allow the establishment of a statistically stationary large-amplitude bulk

part – provided the latter is possible with the boundary condition of vanishing amplitude

at the ends. We focus our attention to parameters in the vicinity of the convective-absolute

threshold at which the fronts of the deterministic GLE cease to propagate. And we investi-

gate in particular the statistical dynamics of phase and amplitude ﬂuctuations in the front

region.

A. Unforced homogeneous solution

We are interested in the eﬀect of small additive noise on the spatio-temporal structure

formation in large but ﬁnite or semiinﬁnite systems. Nevertheless it is useful to brieﬂy recall

ﬁrst the properties of the most simple solutions of the unforced GLE in an inﬁnite system.

This shows what one might expect to see in the bulk of a very large system far away from

the boundaries — ignoring for the moment questions related to boundary induced pattern

selection processes.

The GLE (2.1) shows for σ=0 a continuous family of traveling wave (TW) solutions

with constant wave number q, frequency Ω =

qv, and modulus R given by

This TW solution family bifurcates at the marginal stability curve, µ = q2, of the A=0

solution out of the latter while the former becomes unstable there. The critical values are

µc = qc = Ωc=0. The bifurcation is nonhysteretic and forwards in the cubic case

and hysteretic, backwards in the quintic case

B. Convective-absolute instability

The noise susceptibility of the pattern formation process described by the GLE (2.1)

changes signiﬁcantly [2, 16] when crossing the parameter combination of µ, v shown in Fig. 1

for the so called convective-absolute instability [15]. This combination

is marked by the front solution of the deterministic GLE with σ = 0 undergoing a reversal

of the front propagating direction in an inﬁnite system. Consider a front that connects

the basic state A = 0 being realized at x

to a homogeneous solution with A

= 0

→ −∞

at x

. For parameter values below (above) the respective curves in Fig. 1 this front

→ ∞

moves to the right (left). Thus the basic state A = 0 (the homogeneous solution A

= 0)

expands to the right (left). The region below (above) the respective curves in Fig. 1 where

the basic state A = 0 (the homogeneous state A

= 0) invades the whole system is called the

convectively (absolutely) unstable region of the A = 0 solution [2, 16]. Thus, the boundary

(2.10) is also called the convective-absolute instability boundary.

For the cubic GLE the boundary µc

a = v2/4 results from a linear analysis [2]. For the

−

backwards bifurcating solution arising in the quintic GLE the respective front that reverts

its propagation direction is a nonlinear one [20]. Note that in the latter case the convective-

absolute instability boundary [17] connects for v

The boundary condition A(x = 0, t) = 0 that we apply in our simulations stops any

front propagating to the left and it changes, i.e., it deforms the front proﬁle when the

front is suﬃciently close to the boundary at x = 0. This can be seen in Fig. 2 for the

example of the deterministic quintic GLE. There the lines show the modulus proﬁle R and

the spatial growth rate κ = R′/R versus x together with κ versus R obtained numerically for

several parameter values above the convective-absolute instability boundary. To facilitate

comparison of diﬀerent cases we introduce the reduced horizontal ”distance”

at A = 0 the situation is more complicated [14]: Not only does the establishment of the

ﬁnal front connecting the inlet condition A = 0 with a statistically stationary saturated

bulk with

to generate with the boundary condition A(x = 0) = 0 a noise sustained ﬁnite-amplitude

structure with

calculations.

A rough estimate for an equivalent noise strength for the cubic GLE would be to demand

that the reduced noise ”temperature” σ2/V (RN ) is in both cases the same. This would

require for the cubic GLE at a common µ of, say, 0.05 that σ is by about a factor of 13

smaller than for the quintic GLE.

However, basing the comparison on the requirement that σ2/V (RN ) is the same for the

cubic and quintic case one has to keep in mind that the curvatures of V around the states

A = 0 and A = RN which are connected by the fronts remain diﬀerent – cf. Fig. 3. Since

these curvatures around A = 0 (A = RN ) measure the growth (decay) rates of ﬂuctuations

around the respective states it is useful to compare their ratios via a kind of Ginzburg

23 Gquintic. This largely explains the stronger noise sensitivity of the cubic GLE for

for the cubic GLE.

The cubic GLE with additional (but very small) complex coeﬃcients has previously been

investigated, e.g., for noise strengths of about σ = 1.9

10−

6 in our units of eqs. (2.1-2.5).

The corresponding noise ”temperature” σ2/V (RN ) is about 10−

8 for a typical value of, say,

·

µ = 0.035 [3]. This noise was found to ﬁt the experimental results on the noise sustained

traveling Taylor vortices under statistically stationary fronts in the convectively unstable

regime of open Taylor-Couette systems with axial through-ﬂow [3].

D. Numerical methods

Equation (2.1) was solved numerically with a forward-time, centered-space method [21]

subject to the boundary conditions

A(x = 0, t) = 0 = A(x = L, t)

(2.14)

on the complex amplitude. System sizes L were chosen to be suﬃciently large to allow for

the establishment of a saturated bulk amplitude. Typically, a spatial step dx = 0.4 was used

with a time step of dt = 0.072. Calculations were performed for sequences of the paramater v

at several values of the control parameter µ. Most of them were done at µ = 0.05. The noise

source η was realized by Gaussian distributed random numbers of unit variance that were

divided by √dtdx to ensure independence of the correlation functions of the discretization.

A test of diﬀerent pseudo random number generators, namely, L’Ecuyer’s method with Bays-
Durham shuﬄe [21], ran3 [21], and the R250 shift-register random number generator [22]

gave similar results.

After the simulations were started, a suﬃciently long time depending on the parameters,

e.g., on the closeness to the convective-absolute threshold had to be waited until the system

relaxed into a statistically stationary state with time independent averages. Thereafter

time averages were evaluated over several consecutive time intervals and ﬁnally averaged.

Within the forward-time integration method A(x, t) remains uncorrelated with η(x′, t) at

the same time, < f (η)g(A) > = < f (η) >< g(A) >, so that, e.g., < Aη > = 0 as well as

< qη > = 0. But < Ωη >

= 0. Here the frequency Ω (wave number q) is deﬁned as a

(2.1) is described in this section.

A. Growth length ℓ

In Fig. 4 we show how the growth length ℓ of the downstream pattern occurring in the

forced cubic GLE varies with noise strength σ. Here ℓ is deﬁned by the distance from x = 0

at which the root-mean square

|

half its bulk value. In the absence of noise ℓ diverges at the convective-absolute threshold

p

v = vc

a since there the deterministic pattern is blown out of the system.

−

For ﬁnite σ the solution with ﬁnite A is noise-sustained in the convectively unstable regime

∆ > 0 [2]. In this regime ℓ is far from the convective-absolute threshold well described by

the relation ℓ

(1 + √2∆) ln σ following from a quasilinear analysis of the cubic GLE [11]

∼ −

presented here in an appendix. However in the vicinity of the threshold ∆ = 0 the growth

length ℓ obtained from the nonlinear GLE shows a characteristic crossover to the behavior

at ∆ < 0.

The noise inﬂuences also in this absolutely unstable regime, ∆ < 0, the ﬁnite amplitude

solution at least close to threshold: The curves ℓ(∆, σ) in Fig. 4(a) break away from the

dotted ℓ(∆, σ = 0) reference growth length curve at negative ∆ values that decrease with

increasing σ, i.e., further and further away from the convective-absolute threshold. The

associated inﬂection points can be most easily identiﬁed by the maxima in ∂ℓ(∆, σ)/∂∆

shown in Fig. 4(b). These peak positions of ∂ℓ/∂∆ vary with σ as shown in the inset of

Fig. 4(b). So the growth length shows for the cubic GLE a deﬁnite noise sensitivity also in

the absolutely unstable regime.

This sensitivity is signiﬁcantly smaller in the quintic GLE. This can be seen by comparing

the behavior of the growth length with the ﬂuctuations of the modulus R =

, of the

|

frequency, and of the wave-number (cf, Sec. III B). To that end we show in Figs. 5 and 6 ℓ

and ∂ℓ/∂∆ together with the inverse of the standard deviations of the modulus

of the frequency sΩ (3.9), and of the wave-number sq (3.9) at µ=0.05 as functions of ∆

for the cubic and quintic GLE, respectively. The noise strengths σ = 2.5

10−

5 and 10−

3,

·

respectively, used for these ﬁgures are roughly equivalent based on the criterion described in

Sec. II C. However, the potential minima in the cubic case are broader than in the quintic

case – cf. Fig. 3 – and therefore the modulus ﬂuctuations in the former are larger than those

in the latter one. This can be seen by comparing the reduced inverse √< R2 >/sR in the

absolutely unstable regime, ∆ < 0, of Figs. 5(c) and 6(c).

The peak position of ∂ℓ/∂∆ coincides with the drop-oﬀ in the inverse standard deviations

1/s. For the cubic GLE (Fig. 5) it occurs at ∆=-0.049, thus being shifted signiﬁcantly into

the absolutely unstable regime while that of the quintic GLE (Fig. 6) remains at ∆=0.

As an aside we mention that for the quintic GLE at a subcritical growth parameter of,

say, µ=-0.05 the behavior of the growth length ℓ and of ∂ℓ/∂∆ is for ∆ < 0 similar to the

one shown in Fig. 6(d) for µ=0.05. For µ < 0, ∆ > 0 we did not ﬁnd a noise sustained

large-amplitude solution.

B. Frequency and wave-number correlations

Previous investigations of the forced cubic GLE in the bulk part of the solution at far

downstream locations x

ℓ showed for diﬀerent but small noise strengths that frequency

≫

ﬂuctuations are in the absolutely unstable regime much smaller than in the convectively

unstable regime [3]. In order to study this question of the noise sensitivity in both regimes we

have investigated in more detail the frequency and wave-number ﬂuctuations at x = ℓ/2, ℓ,

and 2ℓ. The results are shown in Fig. 5 for the cubic GLE and in Fig. 6 for the quintic GLE.

Before we discuss them we ﬁrst present some basic properties of the phase ﬂuctuations as

described by the forced GLE (2.1).

ℓ/2, ℓ, and 2ℓ. For the parameters shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 the mean frequency < Ω >

as well as the mean wave number < q > are negligible. Plotting the inverse of sΩ, sq,

and sR allows to visualize the small ﬂuctuations in the absolutely unstable regime better

than in a direct plot of, say, s2

Ω have been presented previously for the
small noise strengths occurring in Taylor-Couette experiments [3]. On the lower level of

Ω. Such plots for s2

resolution inherent in this data presentation these results show similar behavior as ours.

However, plotting 1/sΩ instead allows to identify more clearly the crossover behavior from

the parameter regime with small ﬂuctuations to the one with large ones.

The ∆-variations of 1/sΩ, 1/sq, 1/sR, and of ∂ℓ/∂∆ indicate that this transition is shifted

to negative ∆, i.e. into the absolutely unstable regime. A similar result for the transition

between deterministic and noise sustained standing wave solutions of complex coupled cubic

GLE’s was deduced from the behavior of the second moments of the frequency and wave-

number power spectra of the ﬂuctuating amplitudes [10]: With decreasing µ the correlation

length deﬁned via the time average of the second moment of the Fourier spectrum of A(k, t)

begins to decrease towards values characteristic for noise-sustained structures in the con-

vectively unstable regime clearly before µc

a is reached when noise is present. Similarly the

−

width of the frequency power spectrum starts to increase with decreasing µ already above

the convective-absolute threshold µc

a [10].

−

However, the variation of 1/sΩ with ∆ shows for the cubic case in Fig. 5 a broader

crossover interval between large frequency ﬂuctuations in the convectively unstable regime

at ∆ > 0 and small frequency ﬂuctuations in the absolutely unstable regime at ∆ < 0 than

the curves 1/sq and 1/sR for wave-number and modulus ﬂuctuations. The ∆-value at which

1/sq and 1/sR drop down towards zero agrees quite well with the peak location of ∂ℓ/∂∆.

The latter moves with increasing noise strength further into the absolutely unstable regime

November 23, 2013

12

as shown, e.g., for the cubic GLE in the inset of Fig. 4(b).

The variations of s(∆) with ∆ at diﬀerent downstream locations x = ℓ/2, ℓ, and 2ℓ are

similar to each other: with ∆ becoming more negative, i.e., further and further into the

absolutely unstable regime the ﬂuctuations sΩ and sq become constant at levels that depend

on the measuring location – the closer to the inlet where R becomes smaller the larger are
the ﬂuctuations. This behavior is reﬂecting the relation sΩ ∼
directly from Eq. (3.5).

The downstream reduction of the variance sΩ of the frequency ﬂuctuations with increasing

distance from the inlet and with increasing amplitude along the front is shown in Fig. 7 for

the quintic GLE. There we compare the behavior of sΩ together with the front proﬁles of

in the absolutely and in the convectively unstable regime close to the threshold

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied numerically the inﬂuence of small additive noise on pattern formation

near a forwards and near an inverted bifurcation as described by a cubic and quintic GLE,

respectively, when a ﬁnite group velocity v can blow the ﬁnite-amplitude part out of the

system, i.e., in the vicinity of the so-called convective-absolute instability at ∆ = v/vc

curvatures of the deterministic GLE potentials around the states A = 0 and A = RN : the

resulting growth enhancement of ﬂuctuations near A = 0 is larger in the cubic than in the

quintic case and in addition the damping of ﬂuctuations near A = RN is smaller in the cubic

than in the quintic case.

In the cubic case the transition between the regimes of small and large ﬂuctuations of am-

plitude, frequency, and wave number is shifted to a negative ∆ into the absolutely unstable

regime. Simultaneously the pattern growth length ℓ(∆) has there a characteristic inﬂection

point that shows up as a peak in ∂ℓ/∂∆.

In the quintic case all this occurs at the un-

shifted convective-absolute threshold ∆ = 0. Common to both cases is that the ﬂuctuations

decrease along the front in both regimes with growing pattern amplitude

For negative subcritical amplitude growth rates, µ < 0, we did not ﬁnd noise-sustained,

large-amplitude, backwards bifurcating patterns when ∆ is positive: the nonlinear deter-

ministic front dynamics of the quintic GLE blows any large-amplitude part downstream

away from the inlet where A = 0 and eventually any ﬁnite system is ﬁlled only with small-

amplitude ﬂuctuations of A around the stable ﬁxed point A = 0 of the unforced system.

APPENDIX

Here we estimate the noise dependence of the downstream growth length ℓ of the nonlinear

structure in the convectively unstable regime of the cubic GLE where this structure is noise

sustained. To that end we approximate ℓ by the length where the mean squared amplitude

Clin(x) =

Alin(x)

of the linear GLE has grown from the inlet value A(x = 0) = 0 to,

say, one half of the nonlinearly saturated bulk value

µ/2. So we solve the equation

Clin(x = ℓ) =

for ℓ. Actually the linear solution may not hold there anymore. But as it will become

obvious below the result is roughly independent of the coeﬃcient chosen in Eq. (A.1) so also

smaller numbers than 1

2 could be chosen here for a characteristic growth length.

We evaluate the equal-time correlation Clin(x) via the frequency integral of the spectrum

Clin(x, ω) of the time-displaced autocorrelation function of ﬂuctuations of Alin at the same

downstream position x. For large downstream distances x from the inlet this spectrum is

given by [11]

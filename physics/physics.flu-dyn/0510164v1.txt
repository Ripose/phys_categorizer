We investigate the formation of acoustic horizons for an inviscid ﬂuid moving in a pipe in the case
of stationary and axi-symmetric ﬂow. We show that, diﬀerently from what is generally believed, the
acoustic horizon forms in correspondence of either a local minimum or maximum of the ﬂux tube
cross-section. Similarly, the external potential is required to have either a maximum or a minimum
at the horizon, so that the external force has to vanish there. Choosing a power-law equation of
state for the ﬂuid, P ∝ ρn, we solve the equations of the ﬂuid dynamics and show that the two
possibilities are realized respectively for n > −1 and n < −1. These results are extended also to the
case of spherically symmetric ﬂow.

Sonic horizons can be generated by the motion of a classical ﬂuid [1]. The simplest case is represented by a ﬂuid
with space-dependent velocity ﬂowing trough a tube with variable section (Laval nozzle) [2]. If the ﬂuid ﬂows in the
direction where the tube becomes narrower, the ﬂuid velocity v will increase downstream. Eventually, a point will
be reached where v is equal to the local speed of sound c and v > c beyond this point. An acoustic perturbation
generated in the supersonic region cannot reach the upstream subsonic region. We have generated a sonic horizon,
the acoustic analogue of a spacetime horizon. The downstream subsonic region behaves, as long as only acoustic
disturbances are concerned, as the acoustic analogue of a black hole, a dumb hole.

Starting from the original proposal of Unruh [1], acoustic (and other condensed matter analogues) black holes have
been used to describe various kinematical aspects of general relativity such as event and cosmological horizons, ﬁeld
theory in curved spacetime, Hawking radiation etc. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Recently,
the ﬂuid/gravity analogy as been extended also at a dynamical level. It has been used to gain information about
Einstein’s equations governing the dynamics of a spherically symmetric gravitational black hole [20, 21]. The lack of
direct experimental tests has always been an obstacle for the research on black holes. Investigations on “artiﬁcial”
black holes could represent a useful bridge to make black holes experimentally more accessible.

Although conceptually very simple, the realization of acoustic horizons requires ﬁne-tuning of the external potential
acting on the ﬂuid, of the tube proﬁle and of the initial ﬂuid velocity [6, 7, 22]. In the case of the Laval nozzle, it is
widely believed that the horizon must form exactly at the narrowest part of the nozzle [6, 7, 19, 23]. However, it is
not easy to ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the formation of the horizon. In the general case, the equations
governing the dynamics of the ﬂuid are very diﬃcult to solve.

In this paper we investigate the formation of acoustic horizons in the case of a inviscid ﬂuid with stationary, axially
or spherically symmetric ﬂow. When considering axi-symmetric ﬂuid motion we will discuss separately the case of
a ﬂux tube of varying section and the presence of external forces. We show that, diﬀerently from what is generally
believed, the acoustic horizon forms in correspondence of either a local minimum or maximum of the ﬂux tube cross-
section. Similarly, the external potential is required to have either a maximum or a minimum at the horizon, so
ρn, we solve
that the external force has to vanish there. Choosing a power-law equation of state for the ﬂuid, P
the equations of the dynamics and show that the two possibilities are realized respectively for n >
1.

Moreover, we will determine the range in the initial conditions for which the horizon eﬀectively forms.

Axi-symmetric ﬂow

Let us ﬁrst consider axially symmetric, stationary, inviscid ﬂuid motion, which is constrained on a pipe. Indicating
with x the coordinate along the symmetry axis, the ﬂuid is described by its velocity v(x), density ρ(x) and pressure
P (x). The ﬂux tube is characterized by its cross-section A(x) and we will assume that external forces, characterized
by the potential ψ(x)), act on the ﬂuid. Because of the symmetries of the problem all the parameters are functions
of the coordinate x only. The equations governing the dynamics of the ﬂuid are the continuity and Euler equations

where M = v/c is the Mach number. The nozzle equation (2) can be used to discuss the conditions for the formation
of sonic horizons, i.e of a surface with M = 1 separating a subsonic (M < 1) from a supersonic (M > 1) region.
Assuming that v, v′(x) = dv/dx, A are everywhere ﬁnite and nonvanishing, one can easily see from Eq. (2) that,
the if a horizon forms, this necessarily happens in correspondence of a local extremum of the tube cross-section A.
Conversely, if the cross-section A(x) has a local extremum at a point xh necessarily a sonic horizon must form at this
point. Depending on the sign of v′(x) we have two diﬀerent situations.

(i) The ﬂuid velocity grows monotonically passing from the subsonic to the supersonic region. In this case the
cross-section A has a local minimum at the horizon. This corresponds to the usual situation. The ﬂux tube has the
shape of the Laval nozzle, a converging pipe where the ﬂuid is accelerated, followed by a throat and by a diverging pipe
where the ﬂuid continues to accelerate. The corresponding ﬂow situation and qualitative behavior of the parameters
are shown in Fig. (1).

(ii) The ﬂuid velocity decreases monotonically passing from the subsonic to the supersonic region. In this case the
cross-section A has a local maximum at the sonic horizon. This ﬂow situation is very unusual and until now has not
be considered in the literature. The ﬂux tube has the form of a diverging pipe where the ﬂuid is decelerated followed

and qualitative behavior of the parameters are shown in Fig. (2).

Notice that if the tube cross-section is given as a function of the ﬂuid velocity, we can write the nozzle equation in

the equivalent form

This equation relates the appearance of an horizon directly with the existence of local extrema of A(v) without the
need of further conditions on the behavior of the space derivatives of v. We will make use this equation when discussing
the formation of horizons in a ﬂuid with spherically symmetric ﬂow.

Until now our discussion has been focused on the nozzle equation (2). The previous results are the whole information
we can extract from this equation. There are two main points on which Eqs. (2) give no information. First, they do
not say to us which of the two possibilities (i), (ii) is actually realized. Second, our results are based on the rather
strong assumption v′(x)
, 0. In general its validity depends on both the dynamics and the initial conditions [17].
In order to answer to the previous questions one has to choose an equation of state for the ﬂuid and to solve Eqs. (1).
To be more concrete we will consider a ﬂuid with a power-law equation of state,

under consideration explicit solution of Eqs. (1),(4) cannot be found. However, one can ﬁnd solutions in implicit
form, writing ρ, c, A as a function of the ﬂuid velocity v. The solution of Eqs. (1) for a ﬂuid with equation of state
given by Eq. (4) and n

d2A/dv2 is everywhere nonzero excluding the possibility of a ﬂex point. To infer about the behavior of A(x), once
the behavior of A(v) is known, we need just to use the trivial identities dA/dx = (dA/dv)(dv/dx), d2A/dx2 =
(d2A/dv2)(dv/dx)2 + (dA/dv)(d2v/dx2). When dv/dx is ﬁnite and nonvanishing, local maxima (minima) of A(v)
correspond to local maxima (minima) of A(x). We have therefore shown that in the case of a ﬂuid with a power-law
equation of state (4), the acoustic horizon forms in correspondence of a minimum (maximum) of the cross-section

FIG. 3: Qualitative behavior of the parameters for a ﬂux tube of constant section and varying external potential. The ﬁgure
on the left (right) corresponds to case I, (II), respectively. The black, grey and dashed lines represent the external potential ψ,
the ﬂuid velocity v and the speed of sound c, respectively. The vertical axis indicates the position of the horizon. c and v are
normalized to their horizon values.

The main diﬀerence between Eq. (2) and (7) is the change of sign in the right hand side. This means that, diﬀerently
to what happens for v′(x) and A′(x) in the nozzle Eq. (2), v′(x) and ψ′(x) have the same (opposite) sign in the
subsonic (supersonic) region.

Again, assuming that v and v′(x) are everywhere ﬁnite and nonvanishing, one can easily show using Eq. (7) that
the horizon must form in correspondence of local extrema of the external potential ψ. This gives a a null (external)
force condition at the horizon location. Depending on the sign of v′(x) we have two diﬀerent situations. (I) The ﬂuid
velocity grows monotonically passing from the subsonic to the supersonic region. In this case the external potential ψ
has a local maximum at the horizon. (II) The ﬂuid velocity decreases monotonically passing from the subsonic to the
supersonic region. Now the external potential has a local minimum at the sonic horizon. The qualitative behavior of
the parameters for both cases (I) and (II) is depicted in Fig. (3).

Also in the case under consideration we can solve the ﬂuid-dynamical equations for a ﬂuid with equation of state

given by Eq. (4). We have for n

where α, β are integration constants. Solving the equation c(v) = v one easily ﬁnds the ﬂuid velocity on the horizon,

of the horizon does not imply limitations on the range of variation of v. Using the previous equations one can now

In solving Eqs. (1) in the two cases of constant and non constant cross-section, we have not considered n = 1 in the
equation of state (4). Solutions (5) and (8) become singular for n = 1 and this case has to be considered separately.
For n = 1 the solutions for a ﬂux tube with variable cross-section read

In both cases we have for the ﬂuid velocity at the horizon vh = a. A straightforward calculation shows that, as
expected, the horizon forms for a minimum of the tube cross-section and for a maximum of the external potential.

As we have already noted one main physical requirement for the formation of an acoustic horizon is that v′(x)
remain ﬁnite and non vanishing throughout the ﬂux tube. In general to keep v′(x)
one needs a ﬁne-tuning of
the initial conditions. For instance, if v is too large at the entrance of the Laval nozzle the ﬂow will become supersonic
at a point upstream from the throat so that v′(x)

under consideration [21]. The constraint (11) represent a constraint on the geometrical form of the ﬂux tube, which
forces the cross-section to have a local extremum exactly at the position of the horizon. The constraint (11) also
implies that v′(x) is ﬁnite and nonvanishing at the horizon. This can be demonstrated using the trivial identity
dv/dx = (dv/dY )(dY /dX)(dX/dr)(dr/dx) and showing that each factor in the product is individually ﬁnite and
nonvanishing at the horizon. The third factor is proportional to the Hawking temperature of the horizon, the fourth
is the ﬂuid density [20, 21], therefore both must be
. The ﬁrst and the second can be shown to be ﬁnite and
non-vanishing at the horizon by using the explicit solution of the constrained ﬂuid dynamics derived in Ref. [21].

Spherically symmetric ﬂow

Let us now consider the inviscid, isentropic, spherically symmetric ﬂow of a ﬂuid with equation of state given by
(4). For simplicity we will set to zero the external forces acting on the ﬂuid. Using spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), the
continuity and Euler equations yield,

d(r2vρ)

= 0,

+ a2ρn−2 dρ

= 0.

These equations can be easily generalized to the case when a pointlike source is located at the origin of the spherical
coordinate system. Whereas the Euler equation remains unchanged the continuity equation gets a contribution
proportional to δ(r). In this more general case for r > 0 the dynamics of the system is still described by Eqs (12).

The formation of sonic horizons for the spherically symmetric ﬂow can be easily discussed noticing that Eqs. (12)
are formally identical to those describing an axi-symmetric ﬂow along a tube with cross-section A(r) = 4πr2. Because
the section increases monotonically, in view of the previous derived results we should conclude that an horizon cannot
form. However, these results rely on the assumption that v′(r) = dv/dr is everywhere ﬁnite. Relaxing this assumption
could allow for the formation of an acoustic horizon even though A(r) does not have local extrema. Divergence of v′(r)
implies that the ﬂuid has inﬁnite acceleration. The discussion has therefore no direct physical relevance. However,
considering this more general situation sheds light on the physical mechanism on which horizon formation is based.
Setting β = r2vρ, Eqs. (12) are solved by Eqs. (5) with A(r) = 4πr2. The condition for horizon formation is also
given by Eq. (6). Using Eqs. (5) and the continuity equation in (12) one gets A(v) = 4π β
v2)]1/(n−1). One
can easily show that for n >
1) A(v) has a minimum (maximum) in correspondence of v = vh, with vh
given by Eq. (6). It is immediately evident from the equation dA/dv = (dA/dr)(dr/dv) that in this case local extrema
of the function A(v) are not related with local extrema of A(r) but with the divergence of dv/dr. The function A(v)
contains more information about the formation of acoustic horizons then the function A(x) (or A(r)). The vanishing
of dA/dv is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of a point where v = c, .

Transition from the Couette-Taylor system to the plane Couette system

Fachbereich Physik, Philipps Universit¨at Marburg, D-35032 Marburg, Germany

Holger Faisst and Bruno Eckhardt

We discuss the ﬂow between concentric rotating cylinders in the limit of large radii where the
system approaches plane Couette ﬂow. We discuss how in this limit the linear instability that leads
to the formation of Taylor vortices is lost and how the character of the transition approaches that of
planar shear ﬂows. In particular, a parameter regime is identiﬁed where fractal distributions of life
times and spatiotemporal intermittency occur. Experiments in this regime should allow to study
the characteristics of shear ﬂow turbulence in a closed ﬂow geometry.

The transition to turbulence for a ﬂuid between con-
centric rotating cylinders has attracted much experimen-
tal and theoretical attention. Ever since Taylor’s success
[1] in predicting and observing the instabilities for the
formation of vortices the system has become one of the
paradigmatic examples for the transition to turbulence
and a large number of bifurcations have been analyzed
in considerable detail [2–5]. The limiting case of large
radii and ﬁxed gap width where the eﬀects due to cur-
vature become less important and where the system ap-
proaches plane Couette ﬂow between parallel walls has
received much less attention. In this limit the character
of the ﬂow changes: plane Couette ﬂow is linearly stable
and the mechanisms that drive the transition to turbu-
lence are still unclear. The question we address here is
to what extend the Couette-Taylor system can be used
to gain insight into the dynamics of plane Couette ﬂow.
This problem is of both experimental and theoretical
interest. As mentioned, the experimental situation for
Couette-Taylor ﬂow is much better, there being numer-
ous facilities and detailed studies of patterns, boundary
eﬀects and critical parameters [4–6]. The moving bound-
aries in plane Couette ﬂow reduce the experimental ac-
cessibility and the possibilities of applying controlled per-
turbations. On the theoretical side it is an intriguing
question how the change in stability behaviour from the
Couette Taylor system to the plane Couette system oc-
curs. Studies by Nagata [7] show that some states from
the rotating plane Couette system survive the limiting
process and appear in ﬁnite amplitude saddle node bifur-
cations in the plane Couette system (see also the investi-
gation of this state by Busse and Clever [8]). Unless the
transition from linear instability dominated behaviour in
Couette-Taylor ﬂow to the shear ﬂow type transition in
plane Couette ﬂow is singularly connected to the absence
of any curvature it can be expected to happen at a ﬁnite
radius ratio near which interesting dynamical behaviour
should occur.

We should mention that there are other useful embed-
dings of plane Couette. Busse and Clever [8] start from a
layer of ﬂuid heated from below with cross ﬂow and pro-
ceed to study the stability and parameter dependence of
the states. And Cherhabili and Ehrenstein [9] start from
plane Poisseuille ﬂow and ﬁnd localized solutions, albeit

at Reynolds numbers higher than the ones studied here.
Our aim here is to follow some of the instabilities in the
Couette-Taylor system to the limit of the plane Couette
system and to identify the parameters where the change
in behaviour occurs. In particular, we study the transi-
tion from laminar Couette ﬂow to Taylor vortices and the
instability of vortices to the formation of wavy vortices.
Note that the asymptotic situation of plane Couette ﬂow
can be characterized by a single parameter, a Reynolds
number based on the velocity diﬀerence, whereas Couette
Taylor ﬂow has at least two parameters, the Reynolds
numbers based on the velocities of the cylinders. This
extra degree of freedom provides an additional parame-
ter that can be used to modify the ﬂow without changing
the basic features.

In cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, z) the equations of mo-
tion for the velocity components (ur, uφ, uz) can be writ-
ten as

∂tur +(cid:16)u · ˜∇(cid:17) ur − ν ˜∆ur + ˜∇p =
ν(cid:18) 1

and where ei are the unit basis vectors [10]

The terms in eqs. (1)-(4) are arranged so that all the
ones on the right hand side vanish when the system ap-
proaches the plane Couette system, i.e.
in the limit of

1

large radii but ﬁnite velocities at the cylinders. The re-
maining ones become the equations of motion for plane
Couette ﬂow in cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) if the iden-
tiﬁcation x = r and y = φr is made. However, there are
other ways of taking the limit of a small gap that lead
to diﬀerent limiting systems. For instance, the case of
almost corotating cylinders with high mean rotation rate
gives rise to plane Couette ﬂow with an additional Corio-
lis term (‘rotating plane Couette ﬂow’ [7]). Another limit
corresponds to the case of counterrotating cylinders with
diverging rotation rates [11]. In our numerical work we
use the full equations, without any reduction in terms.
This allows us to extend Nagata’s work from the rotating
plane Couette ﬂow to the full Couette-Taylor system.

The velocities at the inner and outer cylinder (distin-
guished by indices i and o, respectively) are prescribed
and deﬁne the boundary conditions

uφ(r = Rx) = ΩxRx ,
ur(r = Rx) = uz(r = Rx) = 0,

x = i, o .

(7)
(8)

For the choice of dimensionless quantities we appeal
to the plane Couette ﬂow limit. There the relevant
quantities are the velocity diﬀerence between the walls,
∆U = RiΩi − RoΩo, and the gap width d = Ro − Ri.
Without loss of generality we can always assume Ωi ≥ 0.
The Reynolds number for plane Couette ﬂow is based on
half the velocity diﬀerence and half the gap width,

Re =

∆U d

4ν

.

(9)

For the Couette Taylor system there are two Reynolds
numbers based on the gap width and the rotation rates
of the inner and outer cylinders,

Rex = RxΩxd/ν ,

(10)

where the index x can stands for i or o, the inner and
outer cylinders. The plane Couette ﬂow Reynolds num-
ber thus is Re = (Rei − Reo)/4. The ratio of these
Reynolds numbers will be called

˜µ = Reo/Rei ,

(11)

(the tilde is used to distinguish it from µ = Ωo/Ωi, a
frequently deﬁned quantity not used here).

η = Ri/Ro

(12)

denotes that ratio of radii.

Experiments and numerical simulations show that
plane Couette ﬂow undergoes a subcritical transition to
turbulence around ReP CF ≈ 320 [12–14]. The Couette-
Taylor system shows a ﬁrst linear instability to the for-
mation of vortices (Taylor-vortex ﬂow, TVF) at Reynolds
numbers that depend on the rotation rates and the curva-
ture of the cylinders. In order to see shear ﬂow dominated
dynamics the critical Reynolds number for the linear in-
stability has to be above ReP CF . The formation of TVF

occurs at Reynolds numbers that can be parametrized in
the form

Re = A(˜µ)(1 − η)−1/2 + B(˜µ)

(13)

for η <
∼ 1 [15]. This number is larger than the tran-
sitional Reynolds number for plane Couette ﬂow if η is
suﬃciently close to one. The minimal radius ratio η320
where the linear instability occurs for Re > 320 strongly
depends on the ratio of the Reynolds numbers of inner
and outer cylinder. A few examples for minimal radius
ratios η320 are summarized in Table I.

Very important for the transition to turbulence in lin-
early stable systems are nonlinear processes that could
give rise to some ﬁnite amplitude states, perhaps station-
ary or periodic, around which the turbulent state could
form. One candidate that could serve as a nucleus for tur-
bulence in plane Couette ﬂow is the stationary state ﬁrst
calculated by Nagata [7]. He observed that the wavy vor-
tices that form in a secondary instability from the TVF in
the rotating plane Couette system can be followed to the
limit of the plane Couette ﬂow where they become part
of a saddle node bifurcation at ﬁnite Reynolds numbers.
This state was also identiﬁed and studied in a diﬀerent
limiting process by Busse and Clever [8]. They found
that the critical axial and azimuthal wavelengths for this
state are

λz = π and λφ = 2π .

(14)

This is roughly twice the critical wave lengths that would
be expected for Taylor vortices.

We developed a numerical code for the solution of the
full Navier-Stokes equation using Fourier modes in ax-
ial and azimuthal direction and Legendre collocation in
the radial direction. The pressure terms were treated
by a Lagrange method. The period in z and φ was de-
termined by the fundamental wave lengths (14) of wavy
vortex ﬂow.

The continuation of the wavy vortex ﬂow from the
Couette-Taylor system to the plane Couette system is
shown in Fig. 1 for the case of the outer cylinder at rest
(˜µ = 0) and for counterrotating cylinders with ˜µ = −1.
For small η the wavy vortex develops from a secondary
bifurcation of TVF, but for suﬃciently large η the wavy
vortex state is created ﬁrst in a saddle node bifurcation.
The critical Reynolds number for the formation of Tay-
lor vortices diverges as η approaches one, but the one
for the formation of wavy vortices approaches a ﬁnite
value. Thus the gap in Reynolds numbers between the
two transitions widens and the region where plane Cou-
ette ﬂow like behaviour can be expected increases with
η approaching one. The radius ratios ηc and Reynolds
numbers Rec of the codimension two point where the in-
stabilities for TVF and wavy vortex ﬂow cross are listed
in Table I. The ratio of radii ηc where the linear insta-
bility of Couette ﬂow and of the Taylor vortex ﬂow cross
is a non-monotonic function of the ratio ˜µ of rotation

2

speed. Both the critical Reynolds numbers for the linear
instability of the Couette proﬁle and for the formation of
wavy vortices increase with decreasing ˜µ, but at diﬀerent
rates and with diﬀerent dependencies of η. As a conse-
quence there seems to be a local minimum near about
0.93 for ˜µ close to −1.

For the parameter value considered here the curvature
of the cylinder walls is geometrically small (see Fig. 2).
On the length of one unit cell in φ-direction the rela-
tive displacement in radial direction from a planar wall
is about π(1 − η), i.e. only 3% for η = 0.99.

The critical Reynolds number for the formation of
wavy vortex ﬂow (WVF) seems to converge to the same
value for both ratios ˜µ shown in Fig. 1. The critical
Reynolds number as well as the rotation speed of the
wavy vortices for several diﬀerent ratios ˜µ are collected
in Fig. 3. The rotation speed is deﬁned as the angu-
lar phase velocity ω of WVF times the mean radius
R = (Ri + Ro)/2 minus the mean azimuthal velocity
v = (ωiRi + ωoRo)/2. For all ratios between the speed
of inner and outer cylinder the critical Reynolds number
for the formation of the wavy vortex state converges to a
value of about 125 and the speed of rotation goes to zero.
The limiting state that is approached is the stationary
Nagata-Busse-Clever state. The velocity ﬁeld of a wavy
vortex solution at η = 0.993, ˜µ = −1 and Re = 124 is
shown in Fig. 4; it diﬀers little from the corresponding
plane Couette state obtained by Busse and Clever [8],
both in appearance and in critical Reynolds number.

In the region above the wavy vortex instability but
below the linear instability the dynamics of perturba-
tions shows the fractal life time pictures familiar from
plane Couette ﬂow [16]. Fig. 5 shows an example at a
radius ratio of η = 0.993 and a Reynolds number ratio
of ˜µ = −1. The initial state was prepared by rescal-
ing a WVF ﬁeld obtained at very low radius ratio and
Reynolds number.
It is interesting to note that even
with this initial condition, which is at least topologi-
cally close to the Nagata-Busse-Clever state, it is not
possible to realize a turbulent signal in its neighborhood:
the state quickly leaves this region in phase space. One
might have hoped that in spite of the linear instability
of the Nagata-Busse-Clever state other states created out
of secondary bifurcations could have supported some tur-
bulent dynamics in its neighborhood, but the numerical
experiments do not support this. The gap between the
Reynolds number where the WVF state is formed and the
one where typical initial conditions become turbulent is
about the same as in plane Couette ﬂow: the WVF states
forms around Re = 125 and the transition to turbulence,
based on the requirement that half of all perturbations
induce a long living turbulent state, occurs near a value
of Retrans = 310, very much as in plane Couette ﬂow
[14].

In summary, we have identiﬁed parameter ranges in
the Couette-Taylor system where some of the character-
istics of the plane Couette system can be found. These
parameter ranges include radius ratios that can be real-

3

ized experimentally. Investigations in this regime should
be rewarding as they open up the possibility to study the
properties of the transition in a closed geometry and to
switch continuously between supercritical and subcritical
transition to turbulence. The observation of a codimen-
sion two point where the linear instability to TVF and
the secondary instability to wavy vortex ﬂow cross should
provide a starting point for further modelling of the tran-
sition in terms of amplitude equations.

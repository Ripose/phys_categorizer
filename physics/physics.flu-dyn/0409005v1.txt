The global entropy generation rate in the zero-mean oscillatory ﬂow of a Maxwell

ﬂuid in a pipe is analyzed with the aim at determining its behavior at resonant ﬂow

conditions. This quantity is calculated explicitly using the analytic expression for

the velocity ﬁeld and assuming isothermal conditions. The global entropy genera-

tion rate shows well-deﬁned peaks at the resonant frequencies where the ﬂow displays

maximum velocities. It was found that resonant frequencies can be considered opti-

mal in the sense that they maximize the power transmitted to the pulsating ﬂow at

the expense of maximum dissipation.

INTRODUCTION

There are several interesting phenomena where the existence of an oscillatory ﬂow leads to

the improvement of a transport process [1]. For instance, the axial dispersion of contaminants

within laminar oscillatory ﬂows in capillary tubes is considerably larger than that obtained

by pure molecular diﬀusion in the absence of ﬂow [2, 3]. Likewise, Kurzweg [4, 5] found

that in a zero-mean oscillatory ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid in a duct, the eﬀective thermal

diﬀusivity reaches a maximum for a given oscillation frequency. This leads to an enhanced

longitudinal heat transfer which involves no net convective mass transfer. In turn, it has

been found [6, 7, 8] that the dynamic permeability of a viscoelastic ﬂuid ﬂowing in a tube

can be substantially enhanced at speciﬁc resonant oscillation frequencies. Under certain

conditions, an enhanced ﬂow rate can be achieved. These phenomena may ﬁnd important

applications in areas of technological interest such as nuclear reactors, combustion processes

and oil recovery [9, 10], as well as for the understanding of physiological ﬂows such as those

present in respiratory and circulatory systems [11, 12].

In this paper, we are interested in the relation between the irreversible behavior of an

oscillating ﬂow and the optimal characteristics of the enhanced transport. In recent years,

a variety of systems have been analyzed and optimized using the Entropy Generation Min-

imization (EGM) method [13, 14, 15, 16]. This method has become a useful tool for evalu-

ating the intrinsic irreversibilities associated with a given process or device. By determining

the conditions under which the entropy generation rate is minimized, the operating con-

ditions can be optimized by reducing the dissipation to a minimum consistent with the

physical constraints imposed on the system.

In ﬂuid ﬂow systems, friction is one of the

main mechanisms responsible for entropy generation, therefore, we must invest useful work

to push the ﬂuid through the pipe against the irreversible viscous dissipation. In this work,

the entropy generation rate is used to evaluate the intrinsic irreversibilities associated with

an oscillatory viscoelastic ﬂow. Some interesting applications of thermodynamic optimiza-

tion have been proposed by Bejan in the context of pulsating ﬂows [11, 12]. In particular,

he has shown that in the respiratory system, the minimization of the mechanical power

requirements by the thorax muscles during the inhaling and exhaling cycle corresponds to

the longest inhaling and exhaling strokes possible, while in ejaculation, the maximization of

the mechanical power transmitted to the ejected seminal ﬂuid explains the existence of an

optimal bursting time interval. It has to be pointed out that these works consider only the

viscous dissipative behavior of ﬂuids. However, most of biological ﬂuids present a viscoelas-

tic nature and improved calculations must also reﬂect their elastic behavior. In fact, del

R´ıo et al. [7] speculated that the human heart beats at the optimum pumping frequency to

produce a maximum ﬂow through arteries and veins according to the viscoelastic properties

of the blood. Recently, this resonant behavior was experimentally observed in a study of

the dynamic response of a Maxwellian ﬂuid [17], where the enhancement at the frequencies

predicted by the theory was proved. In turn, Tsiklauri and Beresnev [18, 19] included the

eﬀect of longitudinally oscillating tube walls and obtained the analogue enhanced behavior.

All these results have motivated to explore the consequences of the enhancement of the dy-

namic response of an oscillating viscoelastic ﬂuid under diﬀerent conditions [20, 21, 22]. At

this point, the question whether this optimum pumping behavior is also optimum or eﬃcient

from a thermodynamical point of view can be formulated. This problem can be addressed

through the analysis of the entropy generation rate [13, 14].

In this paper, we have fo-

cused our attention in the analysis of the relationship between maximum permeability (and,

therefore, maximum velocity) of a zero-mean oscillatory ﬂow of a viscoelastic ﬂuid in a rigid

cylindrical tube and the entropy generation rate that characterizes the process. From the

analytic expression for the velocity ﬁeld, shear stresses are determined and the local and

global entropy generation rate as a function of the oscillation frequency are calculated. In

this work, irreversibilities due to heat ﬂow phenomena are not considered.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

We consider the ﬂow of a Maxwell ﬂuid in a rigid cylindrical tube of radius a under

an oscillatory pressure gradient applied in the longitudinal x-direction. This problem was

solved analytically by del R´ıo et al. [7] in the linear regime, and the corresponding velocity

ﬁeld V (r, t) reads

All physical properties of the ﬂuid are considered constant. In order to obtain analytical

results, in this work we chose a harmonic pressure gradient given by the real part of the
expression Pxe−iωt, where Px is the constant amplitude of the pressure gradient and ω is the

angular frequency. With this assumption, the dimensionless expression for the velocity ﬁeld

A. Entropy Generation Rate

We now proceed to calculate the entropy generation rate. Since the ﬂuid is assumed to

be a simple substance, mass diﬀusion phenomena are disregarded. In addition, we consider

that the main source of entropy generation is given by frictional eﬀects. However, it is

assumed that the rise in temperature in the ﬂuid and walls due to this dissipative eﬀect is

negligible so that temperature remains approximately constant and irreversibilities due to

heat transfer are not taken into account. Under these approximations, the dimensionless
˙S∗, that characterizes the irreversible behavior of the system,

local entropy generation rate,

is given by

˙S∗(r∗, t∗) =

1
T ∗ (cid:18)

∂V ∗

,

o η/Toa2
where ˙S∗ and the dimensionless temperature of the ﬂuid, T ∗, are normalized by V 2
and To, respectively, To being the mean dimensional ﬂuid temperature. Notice that V ∗ and
˙S∗ always are in phase, the temporal variation being cos(t∗) and cos2(t∗), respectively. In
order to obtain the entropy generation rate per unit length in the axial direction, < S∗ >,
S∗ is integrated over the tube cross-section. Thus, < ˙S∗ > is only a function of t∗, ω∗ and

α. The corresponding averaged velocity over the tube cross-section is

< V ∗ >=

V ∗(r∗, t∗)r∗dr∗.

where A is the cross-section area. We can now use equations (3) and (4) to characterize the

resonant behavior of the system.

III. RESULTS

In Fig. 1, the amplitudes of the averaged velocity and the global entropy generation rate

are shown as a function of the dimensionless frequency for a Deborah number α = 0.01. For

comparison purposes, we have used the same value of α as in the paper by del R´ıo, et al.

[7]. It corresponds to a ﬂuid with a relaxation time of the order of seconds, a mass density

and viscosity of the same order of water, and a tube radius of the order of centimeters.

With this value, viscoelastic behavior is well established.

In fact, physical properties of

cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate solution (CPyCl/NaSal, 60/100) [23, 24] give

an α value close to 0.01. For simplicity, in all calculations presented here, the dimensionless

5

temperature was taken as T ∗ = 1. Notice that the maximum values of < ˙S∗ > are found at
the resonant frequencies where < V ∗ > is also maximum. This has important implications

in terms of the useful work that is invested to move the ﬂuid through the pipe: maximum

velocity is obtained at the expense of maximum dissipation. On the other hand, from the

relationship between work W and velocity v, namely, dW/dt = P Av, it is clear that for a

given pressure P and cross-sectional area A, maximum ﬂuid velocity leads also to maximum

power. Therefore, it follows that resonant frequencies can be considered optimal in the sense

that they maximize the power transmitted to the ﬂuid through the pulsating ﬂow.

An interpretation of this result in terms of Darcy’s law can also be given. The phenomeno-

logical law for a frequency-dependent mean ﬂux (or average velocity) can be expressed as
J =< V∗ >=

P , where K(ω∗) is the dynamic permeability [7]. Therefore, ex-

K(ω∗)

−

pressing the global entropy generation rate as the product of ﬂuxes and generalized forces

[25], we get

< ˙S∗ >=

K(ω∗)
T
where in order to satisfy the condition < ˙S∗ >
0, the dynamic permeability must be a
positive deﬁnite quantity. From Eq. (5), it is then clear that maximum values of < ˙S∗ >
will be obtained at those frequencies at which the K(ω∗) is maximized. But from Darcy’s

law these are precisely the frequencies that lead to maximum mean ﬂux or average velocity.

It is also interesting to observe in Fig. 1 that while maximum values of < V ∗ > decrease
as higher resonant frequencies are reached, maximum values of < ˙S∗ > remain almost

constant. This is more clearly shown in Fig. 2 where maxima and minima of the global

entropy generation rate are presented as a function of the frequency. This result indicates the

importance of the ﬁrst resonant frequency where the higher mean velocity is obtained. The

irreversibilities associated to the production of the ﬁrst peak velocity are approximately the

same as those involved in the production of the remaining peaks although maximum velocity

values decrease the higher the frequency. A drastic rise in the minima is observed from zero

frequency to the ﬁrst minimum, but from that value the remaining local minima stay almost

constant and, in fact, they reach a limit value as ω∗

. It is important to emphasize

→ ∞

the fact that the lowest minimum of the global entropy generation rate corresponds to a

stationary state, i.e., to the zero frequency. This result is in agreement with Prigonine’s

theorem, which states a minimum entropy generation for stationary states provided that the

Onsanger coeﬃcients are constant [25].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

7

In this paper, we have used the global entropy generation rate to analyze a zero-mean

oscillatory ﬂow of a Maxwell ﬂuid at resonant conditions.

It was found that the global

entropy generation rate is maximized at the same frequencies at which the ﬂow displays

a resonant behavior. Under these conditions the average velocities are maximum and the

power transmitted to the ﬂuid through the pulsating ﬂow is also maximum. Therefore, it

is from the maximization of power that pumping at resonant frequencies can be considered

optimal. However, from a thermodynamic point of view, maximum average velocities are

reached through the maximization of ﬂow irreversibilities. Given the viscoelastic nature of

most biological ﬂuids, this may help to the understanding of some pulsating physiological

processes [7, 11, 12].

It was observed that global entropy generation rate remains the same at diﬀerent resonant

frequencies although the maximum values of velocity decrease at higher frequencies. On the
other hand, the existence of a lowest minimum value of < ˙S∗ > is in agreement with

Prigonine’s theorem of minimum entropy production for stationary states.

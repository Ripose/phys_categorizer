Abstract

The inverse structure functions of exit distances have been introduced as a novel diagnostic of

turbulence which emphasizes the more laminar regions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Using Taylor’s frozen ﬁeld

hypothesis, we investigate the statistical properties of the exit distances of empirical 3D fully de-

veloped turbulence. We ﬁnd that the probability density functions of exit distances at diﬀerent

velocity thresholds can be approximated by stretched exponentials with exponents varying with

the velocity thresholds below a critical threshold. We show that the inverse structure functions

exhibit clear extended self-similarity (ESS). The ESS exponents ξ(p, 2) for small p (p < 3.5) are

well captured by the prediction of ξ(p, 2) = p/2 obtained by assuming a universal distribution of

the exit distances, while the observed deviations for large p’s characterize the dependence of these

distributions on the velocity thresholds. By applying a box-counting multifractal analysis of the

natural measure constructed on the time series of exit distances, we demonstrate the existence of a

genuine multifractality, endowed in addition with negative dimensions. Performing the same anal-

ysis of reshuﬄed time series with otherwise identical statistical properties for which multifractality

is absent, we show that multifractality can be traced back to non-trivial dependence in the time

series of exit times, suggesting a non-trivial organization of weakly-turbulent regions.

INTRODUCTION

In isotropic turbulence, structure functions are among the favorite statistical indica-

tors of intermittency. The (longitudinal) structure function of order p is deﬁned by

Sp(r) ≡ hδvk(r)pi. The K41 theory [5] obtains that Sp(r) = Cpǫp/3rp/3, where ǫ is the average

energy dissipation rate of the ﬂuid element of size r and Cp is a constant independent of

Reynolds number. The K62 theory [6] extends K41 by assuming a log-normal distribution

of ǫ, which was questioned by Mandelbrot [7]. The anomalous scaling properties was uncov-

ered experimentally [8] implying the non-Gaussianity of the probability distribution of the

velocity increments.

The velocity structure functions consider the moments of velocity increments over space.

However, when one turns to the scalar statistics in passive scalar advection, one often con-

siders averages of the advection time versus the distance [9, 10]. An alternative quantity

was introduced, denoted the distance structure functions [1] or inverse structure functions

[3, 11]:

Tp(δv) ≡ hrp(δv)i,

where δv are a set of pre-chosen thresholds of velocity increments and r(δv) is the exit

distance deﬁned as the minimal distance for the velocity diﬀerence to exceed δv

r(δv) = inf {r : |vi±r − vi| > δv} ,

given a record of velocity vi. In the literature, alternative deﬁnitions are adopted as well,

such as |vi+r − vi| > δv or vi+r − vi > δv.

To ensure that the exit distance is deﬁned, the threshold δv should be less than δvmax =

(vmax − vmin)/2, where vmax and vmin are respectively the maximum and minimum of the

record. On the other hand, there is a minimal velocity increment δvmin = min(|vi+1 − vi|)

for a given record such that for any δv ≤ δvmin we have r = 1. Therefore, we consider the

range (δvmin, δvmax). For any δv in this range, by construction, we will obtain ﬁnite r values

from the velocity record.

The statistical properties studied for synthetic data of 24630 situations from the GOY

shell model of turbulence exhibit perfect scaling dependence of the inverse structure functions

on the velocity threshold [1]. A completely diﬀerent result was obtained in [11] where an

experimental signal was analyzed and no clear scaling was found in the exit distance structure

functions. For smoother stochastic ﬂuctuations associated with a spectrum with exponent

3 ≤ β < 5, such as two-dimensional turbulence, the inverse structure functions exhibit

bifractality [3]. While the large δv’s at ﬁxed r of the velocity structure functions emphasize

the most intermittent region in turbulence, the large r’s at ﬁxed δv probe the laminar regions.

Hence, the inverse structure functions provide probes of the intermediate dissipation range

(IDR) [11] introduced in [12]. It is clear that the extreme events in the distribution of r

provide the prevailing contributions to the inverse structure functions for large exponents,

which should thus be investigated carefully.

To our knowledge, inverse structure functions (or equivalently the statistics of exit dis-

tances) have not been used to characterize experimental three-dimensional turbulence data.

Here, we describe in detail the probability distribution of exit distances r and ﬁnd that the

stretched exponential distribution is a good approximation for all r’s. Then, we analyze

the convergence of the inverse structure functions and investigate their multiscaling prop-

erties. We construct a measure based on the exit distance at each level δv and unveil the

multifractal nature of the measure.

II. STANDARD PRELIMINARY TESTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA

Very good quality high-Reynolds turbulence data have been collected at the S1 ONERA

wind tunnel by the Grenoble group from LEGI [8]. We use the longitudinal velocity data

obtained from this group. The size of the velocity time series we analyzed is N ≈ 1.73 × 107.

The mean velocity of the ﬂow is approximately hvi = 20m/s (compressive eﬀects are

thus negligible). The root-mean-square velocity ﬂuctuations is vrms = 1.7m/s, leading to a

turbulence intensity equal to I = vrms/hvi = 0.0826. This is suﬃciently small to allow for
the use of Taylor’s frozen ﬂow hypothesis. The integral scale is approximately 4m but is

diﬃcult to estimate precisely as the turbulent ﬂow is neither isotropic nor homogeneous at

these large scales.

The Kolmogorov microscale η is given by [13] η =

= 0.195mm, where
ν = 1.5 × 10−5m2s−1 is the kinematic viscosity of air. ∂v/∂t is evaluated by its discrete
approximation with a time step increment ∂t = 3.5466 × 10−5s corresponding to the spatial
resolution δr = 0.72mm divided by hvi.

1/4

The Taylor scale is given by [13] λ = hvivrms

h(∂v/∂t)2 i1/2 = 16.6mm. The Taylor scale is thus about

4

85 times the Kolmogorov scale. The Taylor-scale Reynolds number is Reλ = vrmsλ

ν = 2000.
This number is actually not constant along the whole data set and ﬂuctuates by about 20%.

We have checked that the standard scaling laws previously reported in the literature are

recovered with this time series. In particular, we have veriﬁed the validity of the power-

law scaling E(k) ∼ k−β with an exponent β very close to 5

3 over a range more than two
decades, similar to Fig. 5.4 of [14] provided by Gagne and Marchand on a similar data set

from the same experimental group. Similarly, we have checked carefully the determination

of the inertial range by combining the scaling ranges of several velocity structure functions

(see Fig. 8.6 of [14, Fig. 8.6]). Conservatively, we are led to a well-deﬁned inertial range

60 ≤ r/η ≤ 2000.

III. SCALING PROPERTIES OF INVERSE STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS

A. The probability distributions of exit distances

We have obtained the exit times for 26 δv values: 0.01, 0.0178, 0.0316, 0.0562, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,

0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.33, and 2.7144 m/s.

Fig. 1 shows the probability density functions (pdf’s) P (r) as a function of r/σ for diﬀerent

velocity thresholds δv = 0.5m/s ((cid:3)), δv = 1m/s (∗), δv = 1.5m/s (⊳) and δv = 2m/s (⋆),

where σ2 = hr2i is a function of δv. It is natural to normalize the exit distances by their

standard deviation σ(δv) for a given δv and obtain the pdf of these normalized exit distances

x = r/σ as

Φ(x) = σP (xσ) .

(3)

The inset of Fig. 1 plots the corresponding Φ(x) for the four δv values. One can observe

an approximate collapse for 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 10 but with increasing deviations for large x’s. This

is due to the fact that the pdf’s P (r) for large δv in the semi-logarithmic plot exhibit ap-

proximate linear behaviors over a broad range of the normalized exit distances (exponential

distribution), while small δv’s have their pdf’s with fatter tail (stretched exponential dis-

tribution). Thus, the pdf’s of exit distances are not entirely described by the single scale

σ(δv) but are in addition slowly varying in this structure as a function of δv. We propose

to parameterize the shape of the pdf’s as

Φ(x) = A exp[−(x/x0)m] ,

for x & 1

where the exponent m is a function of δv. This is quite diﬀerent from the inverse statistics

extracted from the time series of ﬁnancial returns, for which the distributions of exit times

have power law tails [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Actually, stretched exponential distribution is

ubiquitous in natural and social sciences, exhibiting “fat tails” (slower decaying than expo-

nential) with characteristic scales x0 [20], while power law distributions have fat tails and

• For δv . 1.5, the exponent m increases approximately linearly with δv as m ≈ 0.20 ×

• For δv & 1.5, m is approximately constant with a value compatible with m = 1

corresponding to pure exponential distributions.

B. Convergence of xpΦ(x)

A preliminary condition for analyzing the inverse structure functions is the accuracy of

the moments of exit distances. One necessary condition for Tp deﬁned by (1) to converge

is that the integrand rpP (r) or xpΦ(x) converges to zero at large r, which requires the

closure of the integrand [21]. We have investigated xpΦ(x) for diﬀerent powers p and values

δv ∈ [0.01, 2.7144] to determine how noisy is the range of r’s that contribute primarily to

Tp(δv). Fixing p, xpΦ(x) is more noisy for larger δv. For instance, x6Φ(x) clearly converges

for δv = 0.5m/s, but not for δv = 2.0 m/s. We ﬁnd that Tp(δv) with p up to 5 can be

evaluated with good statistical conﬁdence. For p = 6, a reasonably good evaluation of

T6(δv) is obtained for small δv. The integrands for q ≥ 8 seem divergent and the evaluation
of the corresponding Tp(δv) are less sound statistically. The typical dependence of xpΦ(x)

as a function of x are shown in Fig. 3 for δv = 1.5 m/s and p = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

We now oﬀer an estimate of the data size needed to estimate reliable inverse structure

functions Tp for diﬀerent orders p. Let us assume that x has a stretched exponential distri-
bution (3) for x greater than some x0. Thus, the integrand of Tp is I(x) = Axp e−(x/x0)m,

where is a normalizing constant. We estimate that a reliable estimation of Tp requires a

good convergence of the integrant up to a value several times the value xc for which the

integrand achieves its maximum (we use a factor κ ≈ 2 − 3 according to Fig. 3). For the

form of the stretched exponential distribution (4), we have xc = x0(p/m)1/m. On the other

hand, the largest typical value xmax observed in a sample of size N is determined by the

standard condition

where the integration can be performed analytically in terms of a Whittaker M function.

When Φ(x) is exponential, expression (5) leads to the simple equation

We now write that Tp(δv) is reasonably well-estimated if the range of x extends at least

κ times beyond xc. This amounts to the condition xmax = κxc, where κ is approximately

independent of δv. It follows that the minimum sample size necessary to calculate Tp(δv)

for an exponential distribution of x’s (m = 1) is given by

N = (m/A)emxmax .

N(p) = (m/A)eκp .

(6)

(7)

For κ ≃ 2 as suggested from the left-middle panels of Fig. 3, with A ≈ 1/x0 with x0 ≈ 0.7

(see Fig. 2), we ﬁnd N(p = 8) ≈ 6 · 106 and N(p = 9) ≈ 5 · 107. Thus, our data set with

N ≈ 1.7 × 107 data points should allow us to get a reasonable estimate of the 8th order

structure function but higher-orders become unreliable.

C. Extended self-similarity of inverse structure functions

To investigate the scaling properties of the inverse structure functions, we deﬁne a set of

relative exponents using the framework of extended self-similarity (ESS) [22]:

Tp(δv) ∝ [Tp0(δv)]ξ(p,p0),

(8)

8

where p0 is a reference order.

In the case of velocity structure functions, p0 = 3 is a

quite natural choice based on the exact Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfth law. There is no similar

reference for the scaling properties of the inverse structure functions and we choose somewhat

arbitrarily p0 = 2. In general, ESS provides a wider scaling range for the extraction of scaling

exponents. We will see in this subsection that Eq. (8) holds for our experimental data of

turbulence with a high accuracy.

Figure 4 presents log-log plots of Tp(δv) vs T2(δv) for p = 1, 2, · · · , 10 with δv ∈

[0.01, 2.7144]. The straight lines hold for 0.2 ≤ δv ≤ 2.7144 and over at least four or-

ders of magnitudes in T2(δv), showing the existence of extended self-similarity in the inverse

structure functions. The scaling range for small p’s seems to be broader than for large p’s.

of inverse structure functions for the threshold δv ranging from 0.2m/s to 2.7144m/s.

The ESS scaling exponents ξ(p, 2) are shown in Fig. 5. The error bars on ξ(p, 2) cor-

responds to ± one standard deviation. There is an indication that ξ(p, 2) has a nonlinear

dependence as a function of p, with a downward curvature making the curve depart from

the linear dependence ξ(p, 2) = p/2 observes for small p’s.

The monoscaling behavior

ξ(p, 2) = p/2

(9)

is predicted from the assumption that the pdf Φ(x) of the normalized exit distances, and
0 rpPδv(r)dr =

given by (4), is independent of δv. By deﬁnition, we have Tp(δv) = hrpiδv =

If Φδv(x) is universal and independent of δv, then the last term in (10) is a number inde-

pendent of δv (and thus of T2(δv)) and the mono-scaling ξ(p, 2) = p/2 follows. Thus, the

prediction (9) holds for those velocity thresholds δv satisfying the condition that the pdf

of exit distance is universal (independent of δv). This is the analog of the K41 prediction

on the standard structure functions. In our present case, there are deviations of the pdf’s

of exit distances from the exponential law at small δv, that we have proposed to be quan-

tiﬁed under the form of stretched exponentials (4) with exponents m(δv) being a function

of δv as shown in Fig. 2. These deviations from exact self-similarity are weaker than for

the direct statistics and are revealed more clearly for the higher orders. We can therefore

attribute the deviation of the empirical ξ(p, 2) from the self-similarity (9) at high orders to

the non-universality of Φδv(x) which depends on the velocity levels δv.

IV. MULTIFRACTALITY OF THE TIME SERIES OF EXIT DISTANCES AT

DIFFERENT δv

To investigate further the multifractal nature of the exit distance series {r(t) : t =

1, · · · , N = 3 × 11 × 219 ≈ 1.7 × 107} for a given δv, we construct a probability measure µ

through its integral function M(t)

where M(t) = 0 for 0 < t < 1 and

µ (]t1, t2]) = M(t2) − M(t1) ,

M(t) =

r(i)

[t]

Xi=1

for 1 ≤ t ≤ N.

The box-counting method allows us to test for a possible multifractality of the measure

µ. The sizes s of the covering boxes are chosen such that the number of boxes of each size

is an integer: n = N/s ∈ N . We construct the partition function Zq as

Zq(s) ,

[µ (](i − 1)s, is])]q .

and expect it to scale as [23, 24]

which deﬁnes the exponent τ (q). For τ (q), a hierarchy of generalized dimensions Dq [25, 26,

27] can be calculated according to

D0 is the fractal dimension of the support of the measure. For our measure (11), we have

D0 = 1. The local singularity exponent α of the measure µ and its spectrum f (α) are related

to τ (q) through a Legendre transformation [24]

four orders of magnitude. Figure 6 plots the partition function Zq(s) for δv = 1.5m/s as a

function of the box size s for six diﬀerent values of q in log-log coordinates. The solid lines

are the least-square ﬁts with power laws for each q. The correlation coeﬃcients of the linear

regressions (in log-log) are all larger than 0.997, demonstrating the existence of a very good

scaling.

(in log-log coordinates) corresponding to power laws.

The scaling exponents τ (q) are given by the slopes of the linear ﬁts of ln[Zq(s)] as a

function of ln s for diﬀerent values of δv. Figure 7 plots τ (q) as a function of q for ﬁve

diﬀerent velocity levels δv. The inset shows the fractal spectra f (α) obtained by the Legendre

transformation of τ (q) deﬁned by (16b). We observe that τ (q)’s are concave and nonlinear, a

diagnostic of multifractality. The maximal and minimal strength of the set of singularities,

αmax and αmin, can be approximated asymptotically by limq→∞ Dq = limq→∞ τ (q)/q and

limq→−∞ Dq = limq→−∞ τ (q)/q, respectively. It can be clearly observed that the steepness of

the curve τ (q) for negative q increases with δv. Consequently, the maximal singularity αmax

increases with δv, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7 where the value of α at the right endpoint

increases with δv.

Since µ is conservative, τ (1) = 0 and τ (0) = −1 for all δv. For a given q < −1, the

function τ (q) decreases with δv. For a given q > 1, there is a critical value δvc such that

dτ (q)/dδv < 0 when δv < δvc and dτ (q)/dδv > 0 when δv > δvc. We ﬁnd that δvc can be

approximated by a linear function

δvc = −0.058q + 0.783 ,

(17)

associated with a correlation coeﬃcient of the linear regression equal to 0.963. In addition,

one can also see that αmin decreases with δv for δv < δvc and increases with δv for δv > δvc.

For q = −1, we ﬁnd for instance that δvc ≈ 1.2m/s.

We have performed exactly the same multifractal analysis as done above on synthetic

time series generated from a stretched exponential distribution and on reshuﬄed data of the

real exit distances. Both tests give linear scaling exponents τ (q) = q −1 in a narrower scaling

range 64 ≤ s ≤ 131072, which is the earmark of monofractality. These tests strengthen the

presence of multifractality extracted from the real exit distance data.

In general, multifractality in time series can be attributed to either a hierarchy of changing

broad probability density functions for the values of the time series at diﬀerent scales and/or

diﬀerent long-range temporal correlations of the small and large ﬂuctuations [28]. Our

comparison, with reshuﬄed data and sequences with the same pdf’s but no correlation

which exhibit trivial monofractality, suggests that multifractality in the set of exit distances

may be attributed at least in part to the existence non-trivial dependence in the time series

of exit distances.

An important feature of the multifractal spectrum f (α) in the inset of Fig. 7 is the ex-

13

istence of negative (or latent) dimensions, that is, f (α) < 0 [29, 30, 31, 32]. The source

of negative dimensions could be twofold. Firstly, the turbulent ﬂow is a stochastic pro-

cess, which introduces intrinsic randomness in the multifractal measure µ. We note that

negative dimensions also appear in continuous multifractals [33, 34, 35]. Secondly, nega-

tive dimensions may be interpreted geometrically by considering cuts of higher dimensional

multifractals [29, 30, 31]. This intuition proposed by Mandelbrot has been proved math-

ematically in the multifractal slice theorem [36, 37, 38].

In the present case, the frozen

ﬁeld hypothesis is applied and we deal with one-dimensional cut of the three dimensional

turbulence velocity ﬁeld.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Based on Taylor’s frozen ﬁeld hypothesis, the statistical properties of the exit distances of

3D turbulence have been investigated. The probability density functions of exit distances at

diﬀerent velocity thresholds have been shown to be well approximated by stretched exponen-

tials. The inverse structure functions was shown to exhibit very clear extended self-similarity

(ESS). The ESS exponents ξ(p, 2) for small p < 3.5 are well described by the monofractal

prediction ξ(p, 2) = p/2 obtained by assuming a universal exponential distribution of the

exit distance. The multifractality is thus related to the dependence of the pdf’s of the

normalized exit distances on the velocity thresholds δv. We have demonstrated that the

sequences of exit distances for each velocity threshold δv exhibit a clear multifractality with

negative dimensions. The scaling ranges over which multifractality holds cover more than

four order of magnitude in the exit distance variable. The comparison, with reshuﬄed data

and sequences with the same pdf’s but no correlation which exhibit trivial monofractality,

suggests strongly that our report of multifractality is not artifactual.

Our report of multifractality in the time series of exit distance, which tends to emphasize

the least turbulent/most laminar regions, suggests a much richer organization of the weakly

turbulent and close to laminar regions than believed until recently.

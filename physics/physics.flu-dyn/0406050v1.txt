In this Letter we investigate the rupture instability of thin liquid ﬁlms by means of a bifurcation
analysis in the vicinity of the short-scale instability threshold. The rupture time estimate obtained
in closed form as a function of the relevant dimensionless groups is in striking agreement with
the results of the numerical simulations of the original nonlinear evolution equations. This suggests
that the weakly nonlinear theory captures the adequate physics of the instability. When antagonistic
(attractive/repulsive) molecular forces are considered, nonlinear saturation of the instability becomes
possible. We show that the stability boundaries are determined by the van der Waals potential alone.

It is well known that a liquid ﬁlm on a planar solid sur-
face may become unstable due to long-range molecular
forces. The forces originating from van der Waals attrac-
tions [1] accelerate thinning in regions of ﬁlm depression
leading to ﬁlm rupture and “spinodal dewetting” [2]. On
the other hand, electrical double layers on the solid sur-
face may give rise to intermolecular repulsions stabilizing
thin ﬁlms against rupture [3].

In recent years, much eﬀort has been put into theo-
retical modelling the dewetting phenomena [4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 11, 14, 15]. A nonlinear theory of the ﬁlm evolu-
tion based on the long-wave nature of the response was
ﬁrst posed in Ref. 4. This approach, which has already
been considered for diﬀerent situations [5], yields nonlin-
ear partial diﬀerential equations that describes the evolu-
tion of the interface shape, surfactant concentration, etc.
Linear stability analysis is routinely applied to predict
the onset of the instability and the characteristic wave-
length, but the rupture time estimate obtained from the
linear theory turns out to be rather poor:
it underesti-
mates the rupture time due to highly nonlinear nature
of response. The most common and straightforward ap-
proach is to solve the evolution equations numerically [6],
[7] [11], [13, 14, 15, 16]. The obvious disadvantage of the
numerical simulation is that for a complex problem that
involves many parameters, full parametric study of the
rupture is quite elaborate.

A bifurcation technique was ﬁrst applied in [8] to ar-
rive at the nonlinear estimate for the rupture time in the

strated that nonlinear terms owing to van der Waals
attractions contribute to rapid acceleration of the rup-
ture beyond the linear regime. Analysis of the nonlinear
evolution of small disturbances leads to a dynamic Lan-
dau equation for the perturbation amplitude. The closed
form solution of the amplitude equation provides a time
for “blowup” of the initial small-amplitude disturbance
that was proposed to be a good estimate of the nonlinear

rupture time. The approach has never been given enough
attention perhaps because the analysis involves rather te-
dious algebra and can only be done “by hand” for some
simple cases. It has been demonstrated in [9] that the
derivation of the amplitude equation can be automatized
by using a previously developed symbolic algorithm for
bifurcation analysis [10]. Although the closed form non-
linear estimate of the rupture time of the thin ﬁlm in
presence of insoluble surfactant was derived in [9], the
lack of parametric study of the problem by simulations
didn’t allow a proper comparison of the two approaches.
Recently, an extensive numerical study of the thin ﬁlm
rupture driven by van der Waals attractive forces in the
presence of insoluble surfactant and hydrodynamic slip
was reported in [11]. We have developed a generalized
theory of thin ﬁlm rupture for an arbitrary intermolecu-
lar potential; further, we compare the rupture time esti-
mate from our theory with the results of simulations by
[11] for the purely attractive potential and come up with
some predictions for the competing (attractive/repulsive)
potential.

We consider a model describing the evolution of a thin
liquid ﬁlm a solid substrate subject to a van der Waals
force in the presence of a slip and insoluble surfactant.
The dimensionless ﬁlm thickness h and surfactant con-
centration Γ are governed by a system of coupled evo-
lution equations derived in the long-wave approximation

ber, β is a Navier slip coeﬃcient, C is a surface tension
parameter and ϕ = (∂∆G/∂h) is the van der Waals po-
tential (all dimensionless). For nonslipping ﬁlms (β = 0)
equations (1-2) are equivalent to those in [7].

The linear stability analysis of the uniform station-
ary state u0 = {h0, Γ0} results in a critical value of
the wavenumber corresponding to a stationary bifurca-
tion point kc = (−ϕ′(h0)/C)1/2. Following a standard
procedure we choose C as a bifurcation parameter.
In
a bounded domain, 0 < x < L, the basic solution
u0 changes stability (becomes spinodally unstable) with
k = kc and when C < Cc = −ϕ′(h0)L2/4π2, where Cc
correspond to a steady bifurcation point.

To investigate the nonlinear problem in the vicinity of
the bifurcation point we expand the bifurcation param-
eter as C = Cc + ǫ2C2 + ..., where ǫ is a small critical-
ity, introduce a slow time scale suggested by the linear
theory, τ = ǫ2t, and seek the solution in power series
of ǫ as u = u0 + ǫu1 + .... Substitution of this expan-
sion into the system (1-2) to the ﬁrst order in ǫ yields
u1 =
U, where U = {1, 0} is a solu-
tion of the linearized zero-eigenvalue problem. The com-
plex amplitude A satisﬁes the dynamic Landau equation
which is determined to O(ǫ3) of the perturbation theory:

The closed form solution of the amplitude equation (3)
can be easily obtained given the initial value of the am-
plitude A0 = A(0). The ”blowup” time, corresponding
to the inﬁnite growth of the amplitude A and providing
a nonlinear estimate of the rupture time (in the original
time scale), in the vicinity of the bifurcation point, as
C2 → 0 is determined solely by the cubic coeﬃcient

trup ≈ (2A2

where A0 is now O(ǫ). An important observation is that
despite the complicated nature of the original evolution
equations, the structure of the cubic coeﬃcient κ in (4)
is very simple: terms in brackets contain only deriva-
tives of the intermolecular potential ϕ and a factor δ/Cc
incorporates the dependence on the rest of parameters.
Since δ > 0, it is readily seen from (4) that for purely at-
tractive potential κ is always positive and the rupture is

inevitable. For the most commonly encountered attrac-
tive potential φ = A/hc, with c = 3, 4 (unretarded and
retarded case, respectively) we calculate the rupture time
from (5) and compare to the results of numerical simula-
tions of the original evolution equations (1-2) reported in
[11]. A = A∗/6πρν2hc−2
is the scaled Hamaker constant
with h∗ being the mean ﬁlm thickness (here and there-
after dimensional quantities are marked with ∗). Typical
evolution of the ﬁlm thickness in numerical simulations
shows an accelerated thinning of the ﬁlm in the depressed
region due to the initial disturbance at some unstable
wavelength λ > 2π/kc with and subsequent ﬁlm rupture.
This behavior suggests that the acceleration of the ﬁlm
rupture is due to a nonlinear self-coupling of the pertur-
bation beyond the linear regime and therefore the cubic
nonlinearity in the amplitude equation (3) should provide
an accurate description of the nonlinear rupture. Since
(5) is formally valid in the close vicinity of the instabil-
ity threshold, it is considered as a nonlinear approxima-
tion for the rupture time, trup, far from the instability
threshold (as in [11]) with one adjustable parameter, A0.
Figures 1–3 show the comparison between the theory
with A0 = 0.106 and the simulations [11].
It is read-
ily seen that there is an excellent quantitative agreement
with the numerical estimate of trup as a function of dif-
ferent dimensionless parameters. An obvious advantage
of the present analysis is that the closed form expression
for the nonlinear rupture time as a function of diﬀerent
parameters of the problem is available in a closed form
expression for a general van der Waals potential.

When the antagonistic attractive/repusive intermolec-
ular interactions are present, nonlinear saturation of the
rupture instability is possible as κ may change sign (su-
percritical bifurcation). Let us consider the general rep-
resentation of the antagonistic van der Waals potential

pulsive retarded van der Waals force) the ﬁlm is stable
For the exponents (3, 9) (short-
if 0.51 < γ1 < 0.73.
range Born repulsion) the stability window is shifted
to lower values of γ1 and the ﬁlm is stable whenever
0.066 < γ1 < 0.30. For instance, using the values of
the Hamaker constants measured for a polystyrene ﬁlm
on oxidized Si wafers with A∗ = 2.2 × 10−20 J and
B∗ = 5.04 × 10−75 J m6 [13] the nonlinear analysis pre-
dicts a stable ﬁlm thickness of h0 ≈ 2 nm (γ1 = 0.068)

while the linear theory results in 1.56 nm and the equi-
librium thickness determined from the minimum of ∆G
is only 1.3 nm [13]. For thicker ﬁlms γ1 is rapidly de-
creasing as h−6
0 , e.g. γ1 ≈ 0.00125 for h0 = 3.9 nm.
Although, a qualitative diﬀerence in the morphology of
dewetting in [13] was observed for thicker ﬁlms (3.9 nm
vs. 4.9 nm) we speculate that the qualitative change is
due to approach to the nonlinear stability boundary as
h∗ approaches the thickness of 2 nm.

When the interplay between algebraic and exponential
potentials is considered (γ1 = 0), the nonlinear stabil-
ity diagram can be deﬁned in terms of γ2 and H as in
Fig. 4. The dashed lines correspond to the boundary
of linear stability, while the regions of nonlinear stability
corresponding to κ < 0 are shown in gray (iii and iv).
Note that, if the long-range attraction is combined with
the shorter-range repulsion (A > 0, Sp > 0), the spin-
odally unstable region is under the dashed curve (region
ii in Fig. 4), and nonlinear saturation occurs for H & 4.5
and small values of γ2 (region iv). In the opposite case
(A < 0, Sp < 0) the spinodally unstable region lies above
the dashed curve (region i) and stabilization occurs for
thinner ﬁlms, H . 4, and moderate values of γ2 (re-
gion iii). For instance, for aqueous ﬁlms on Si substrates
with c = 3, A∗ = −1.41 × 10−20 J and lp∗ = 0.6 nm
[15] we plot γ2 vs. H in Fig. 4 (color curves) for dif-
ferent values of Sp∗ varying from −0.61 mJ/m2 (blue) to
−8.5 mJ/m2(red) due to increasing hydrophobicity of the
substrate [15]. It is evident from Fig. 4 that the emer-
gence of stationary nonruptured ultrathin ﬁlms is pos-
sible on non-hydrophilic substrates as the color curves
cross region (iii), while on hydrophilic substrates (the
blue curve) the ﬁlm of any thickness is stable, in accord
with [15].

More interesting behavior is anticipated for competing
short-range algebraic and exponential potentials. In this
case γ1, γ2 6= 0 and as they both vary with h0 we chose
to depict the stability diagram in terms of dimensional
quantities, Sp∗ and h∗ as in Fig. 5. It is evident that
stabilization is possible for a wide range of ﬁlm thick-
nesses, h∗. When the magnitude of the exponential re-
pulsion is small, the steady nonruptured state is only
possible for ultrathin ﬁlms; for moderate values of Sp∗
the band of stable solutions widens. For instance, when
Sp∗ = 1.1 mJ/m2, with parameters corresponding to the
red curve in Fig. 5, nonlinear theory predicts that the
ﬁlm is stable below a thickness of ∼ 4 nm, whereas linear
stability provides a value of ∼ 2.2 nm.

Finally, we consider van der Waals interactions of the
polystyrene ﬁlms with SiO coating on Si substrate (in
dimensional form) ϕ∗ = A∗Si−A∗SiO
with
A∗Si = −1.3 × 10−19 J, A∗SiO = 2.2 × 10−20 J and B∗ =
5.04 × 10−75 J m6 [16]. In this case the stability diagram
can be depicted in terms of the ﬁlm thickness, h∗, and
the SiO coating thickness, d∗ (not shown). Again, there

is a narrow stability window for ultrathin ﬁlms up to
∼ 2 nm while its width is insensitive to the variation in
SiO coating thickness. The stabilization for thicker ﬁlms
does not materialize similar to the previously discussed
case of exponents (3, 9) without coating.

In conclusion, we have developed a nonlinear theory
for the rupture of a thin liquid ﬁlm subject to a general
van der Waals potential. The comparison between the
prediction of the weakly nonlinear analysis and the nu-
merical results is provided for the ﬁrst time; it is demon-
strated that there is an excellent quantitative agreement
between the nonlinear rupture time estimate from our
theory and the numerical estimate. When an antagonis-
tic potential is considered, the saturation of the rupture
instability beyond linear regime is possible, while the sta-
bility boundary is determined solely by the intermolec-
ular potential. The results concerning the existence of
steady nonruptured states should be accessible via nu-
merical simulations.

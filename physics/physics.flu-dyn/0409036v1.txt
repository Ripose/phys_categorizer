(Dated: May 23, 2011)

The three-dimensional velocity ﬁeld of a propeller driven liquid metal ﬂow is reconstructed by
a contactless inductive ﬂow tomography (CIFT). The underlying theory is presented within the
framework of an integral equation system that governs the magnetic ﬁeld distribution in a moving
electrically conducting ﬂuid. For small magnetic Reynolds numbers this integral equation system
can be cast into a linear inverse problem for the determination of the velocity ﬁeld from externally
measured magnetic ﬁelds. A robust reconstruction of the large scale velocity ﬁeld is already achieved
by applying the external magnetic ﬁeld alternately in two orthogonal directions and measuring
the corresponding sets of induced magnetic ﬁelds. Kelvin’s theorem is exploited to regularize the
resulting velocity ﬁeld by using the kinetic energy of the ﬂow as a regularizing functional. The results
of the new technique are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with ultrasonic measurements.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Flow measurement in metallic and semiconducting
melts is a notorious problem in a number of technolo-
gies, reaching from iron casting to silicon crystal growth.
Obviously, the usual optical methods of ﬂow measure-
ment are inappropriate for those opaque ﬂuids. Ultra-
sonic techniques have problems, too, when applied to
very hot or chemically aggressive melts. A completely
contactless ﬂow measurement technique would be highly
desirable, even if it were only to provide a rough picture
of the ﬂow.

Fortunately, metallic and semiconducting melts are
characterized by a high electrical conductivity. Hence,
when exposed to an external magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬂowing
melt gives rise to electrical currents that lead to a defor-
mation of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld deforma-
tion is measurable outside the ﬂuid volume, and it can
be used to reconstruct the velocity ﬁeld, quite in paral-
lel with the well-known magnetoencephalography, where
neuronal activity in the brain is inferred from magnetic
ﬁeld measurements [1]. The goal of this paper is to report
on a ﬁrst experimental demonstration of such a contact-
less inductive ﬂow tomography (CIFT).

strongly motivated by the wish to reconstruct the sodium
ﬂow in the Riga dynamo experiment by an appropriate
contactless method.

Suppose the ﬂuid to ﬂow with the stationary velocity
v, and to be exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld B, which we
leave unspeciﬁed for the moment. Then, according to
Ohms law in moving conductors the current

j = σ(v × B − ∇ϕ)

(1)

is induced, with ϕ denoting the electric potential. This
current gives rise to the induced magnetic ﬁeld

The ratio of the induced ﬁeld to the applied ﬁeld is
determined by the so-called magnetic Reynolds number,
deﬁned as Rm = µσvl, with µ denoting the magnetic
permeability of the melt, σ its electrical conductivity, v
a typical velocity, and l a typical length scale of the ﬂow.
In industrial applications, Rm is in the order of 0.01...1.
Only for a few large scale sodium ﬂows, as they appear
in fast breeder reactors, but also in the recent hydromag-
netic dynamo experiments [2], Rm reaches values in the
order of 10...100 (of course, in some cosmic dynamos Rm
can be even much larger). Actually, the present work was

Equation (3) follows from taking the divergence of Eq.
(1) and utilizing ∇ · j = 0. Then, Green’s theorem can
be applied to the solution of the arising Poisson equation
∆ϕ = ∇ · (v × B), with demanding that the current is
purely tangential at the boundary [3]. Note that Eq. (3)
is the basic formula for the vast area of electric inductive
ﬂow measurement [4] which is, however, not the subject
of the present work.

In general, the magnetic ﬁeld B on the right hand sides
of Eqs. (1-3) is the sum of an externally applied mag-
netic ﬁeld B0 and the very induced magnetic ﬁeld b.

Hence Eqs. (2,3) represent an integral equation system
which actually can be used to solve dynamo problems in
arbitrary bounded domains [5]. It it also suitable for a
systematic investigation of the non-linear induction ef-
fects as they appear already in the sub-critical regime of
laboratory dynamos [6].

In the following, however, all considerations will be
restricted to problems with small Rm for which B can
be replaced by B0. Then, we get a linear relation between
the desired velocity ﬁeld and the induced magnetic ﬁeld
which is supposed to be measured. But how to cope with
the remaining Eq. (3) for the electric potential?

The answer to this question can be adopted from mag-
netoencephalography [1]. Assume, for a given B0, all
measured magnetic ﬁeld data be collected into an NB di-
mensional vector with the entries b(B0)
, and the desired
velocity components at the NV discretization points by a
vector with the entries vn. The solution of the boundary
integral equation may require a ﬁne discretization of the
boundary, with NP degrees of freedom ϕ(B0)
. Eqs. (2,3)

where the matrices R(B0) and T(B0) depend on the ap-
plied ﬁeld B0, whereas the matrices S and U depend only
on geometric factors.

As is well known from magnetoencephalography, the
inversion of Eq. (5) is a bit tricky due to the singularity of
the matrix (I− U). This singularity mirrors the fact that
the electric potential is deﬁned only up to an additive
constant. We can remove this ambiguity by replacing (I−
U) by a generally well conditioned matrix (I − U)def l :=
(I − U) − N −1eeT , where e is a vector with all N entries
equal to one and eT is its transposed. By applying this
so-called deﬂation method [1] one ends up with

i.e., with a linear relation between the desired velocity

Despite the far-reaching similarity, there is one essen-
tial diﬀerence of our method compared to magnetoen-
cephalography. While in the latter one has to deter-
mine a single neuronal current distribution, in our case
we can produce quite diﬀerent current distributions from
the same ﬂow ﬁeld simply by applying various external
magnetic ﬁelds subsequently. For each applied magnetic

and 0.73 m/s for the downward pumping.

ﬁeld we can measure the corresponding induced ﬁelds,
and utilize all of them to reconstruct the ﬂow.

Concerning the uniqueness question for this sort of in-
version, here we give only a shortened answer, referring
for more details to the previous papers [7, 8]. For spher-
ical geometry, and the two applied magnetic ﬁelds point-
ing in orthogonal directions, the problem can be solved
with some rigour. Suppose we have measured the two

3

corresponding sets of induced magnetic ﬁelds on a sphere
outside the ﬂuid volume, and have expanded them into
spherical harmonics. The desired (solenoidal) velocity
ﬁeld can be represented by two scalars for its poloidal
and toroidal parts. These two scalars can also be ex-
panded into spherical harmonics, but with the expansion
coeﬃcient still being functions of the radius. In [8] it had
been shown (at least in some low degrees of the spheri-
cal harmonics expansion) that what can be derived from
the two magnetic ﬁeld expansion coeﬃcients are some ra-
dial moments of the expansion coeﬃcients for the velocity
ﬁeld. A further concretization of the radial dependence
of the velocity expansion coeﬃcients can only be achieved
by regularization techniques. If we demand, in a slight
overinterpretation of Kelvin’s theorem, the ﬂow to pos-
sess minimal kinetic energy, we obtain a unique solution
for the radial dependence, too.

Without any rigorous proof at hand, we assume that
this result can be generalized to aspherical geometry: the
large main structure of the large scale ﬂow is well infer-
able, with a depth ambiguity of the velocity that can only
be resolved by regularization techniques. Imposing two
orthogonal magnetic ﬁelds represents a certain minimum
conﬁguration for such a ﬂow tomography. For a single
magnetic ﬁeld of one direction there are, of course, ﬂow
components which would be hidden from outside. How-
ever, all those components are detectable for an external
magnetic ﬁeld orthogonal to the previous one.

For our experimental application we employ the so-
called Tikhonov regularization [9], minimizing the total
functional

very small as it is a measure for the divergence the ve-

squared residual deviation of the observed ﬁelds and min-
imizing the kinetic energy of the estimated velocity ﬁeld.
The normal equations, that follow from the minimization
of the functional (7), are solved by Cholesky decomposi-
tion.

III. EXPERIMENT

In the experiment (Fig. 1) we use 4.4 liters of the eutec-
tic alloy Ga67In20.5Sn12.5 that is liquid at room temper-
atures. The ﬂow is produced by a motor driven propeller
with a diameter of 6 cm inside a cylindrical polypropylene
vessel with 18.0 cm diameter. The height of the liquid
metal is 17.2 cm, yielding an aspect ratio close to 1.

The position of the propeller is approximately at one
third of the total hight, measured from the top. Eight
guiding blades above the propeller are intended to re-
move the swirl of the ﬂow for the case that the propeller
pumps upward. Contrary to that, the downward pump-
ing produces, in addition to the main poloidal motion,
a considerable toroidal motion. The rotation rate of the
propeller can reach up to 2000 rpm, which amounts to a
mean velocity of approximately 1 m/s, corresponding to
a magnetic Reynolds number of approximately 0.4.

Two pairs of Helmholtz coils are fed by currents of 22.5
Ampere and 32.5 Ampere, respectively, to produce alter-
nately an axial and a transversal ﬁeld of 4 mT, which
both are rather homogeneous throughout the vessel. Ei-
ther ﬁeld is applied for a period of 3 seconds, during
which a trapezoidal signal form is used. The measure-
ments are carried out for 0.5 seconds, 1 second after the
plateau value of the trapezoidal current has been reached.
Hence, we get an online monitoring with a time resolu-
tion of 6 seconds.

Projections onto the chord

FIG. 7: Sketch of the ultrasonic measurement set-up for the
azimuthal velocity component. The obtained velocity along
the chord is a position dependent mixture of radial and az-
imuthal components. In the middle of the chord, one gets the
pure azimuthal component. (a) Typical situation for down-
ward pumping with dominant azimuthal velocity (at the axial
position 70 mm from the bottom). The projection of the ve-
locity onto the chord has a maximum in the middle of the
chord. (b) Typical situation for upward pumping with dom-
inant radial velocity. The projection of the velocity goes to
zero in the middle of the chord.

The induced magnetic ﬁelds are measured by 49 Hall
sensors, 8 of them grouped together on each of 6 cir-
cuit boards which are located on diﬀerent heights (Fig.
1). One additional sensor is located in the center below
the vessel. The key problem of the method is the re-
liable determination of comparably small induced mag-
netic ﬁelds on the background of much higher imposed
magnetic ﬁelds. An accurate control of the external mag-
netic ﬁeld is essential to meet this goal. In our conﬁgura-
tion the current drift in the Helmholtz coils can be con-
trolled with an accuracy of better than 0.1 per cent. This
is suﬃcient since the measured induced ﬁelds are approx-
imately 1 per cent of the applied ﬁeld. The temperature
drift of the sensitivity can be overcome by enforcing the
applied current in the Hall sensors to be constant. The
temperature drift of the oﬀset problem is circumvented
by changing the sign of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Fig-
ure 2 shows that by these means a stable measurement
of the small induced ﬁeld can be realized, even over a

ventions in UDV measurements). Compare also Fig. 7 for

period of one hour.

For upward and downward pumping, Figs. 3 and 4
show the induced magnetic ﬁelds measured at the 49 po-
sitions, and the inferred velocity ﬁeld at 52 discretization
points. In Fig. 3c we see clearly the upward ﬂow in the
center of the vessel and the downward ﬂow at the rim,
but nearly no rotation of the ﬂow in Fig. 3d. In Fig. 4c
we can identify the downward ﬂow in the center and the
upward ﬂow at the rim, and in Fig. 4d a clear rotation
of the ﬂow. Evidently, the method is able to identify the

5

poloidal rolls and the absence or presence of the swirl.

For both ﬂow directions, Fig. 5 illustrates the applica-
tion of Tikhonov’s L-curves [9]. This curve, which results
from scaling the parameter σpen in Eq. (11) from lower to
higher values, shows the dependence of the mean squared
residual of the measured data on the kinetic energy of the
ﬂow. For low values (left end of Fig. 5) only little kinetic
energy is allowed, leading to a velocity ﬁeld that ﬁts the
measured magnetic ﬁeld data only poorly. For high val-
ues (right end of Fig.5) the data are ﬁtted very well but
with an unphysical high kinetic energy. At the points of
strongest bending (the ”knee”), the resulting velocities
(Figs. 3 and 4) are physically most reasonable [9].

IV. VALIDATION

In order to validate the CIFT method, we have per-
formed independent velocity measurements based on ul-
trasonic Doppler velocimetry (UDV). For that purpose
we have used the DOP2000 ultrasonic velocimeter man-
ufactured by Signal-Processing SA (Lausanne, Switzer-
land), which had already demonstrated its capabilities
for velocity measurements in liquid metals [10, 11]. As
ultrasonic transducers we have used 2 MHz probes.

Because of its comparably large magnetic Reynolds
number (Rm ≈ 0.2), the propeller driven ﬂow in the
cylinder has also a large hydrodynamic Reynolds num-
ber (Re ≈ 2 × 105). Necessarily, the ﬂow is highly turbu-
lent. Strong ﬂuctuations are observed both by the CIFT
method as well as by UDV.

For a sensible comparison of both methods, some time
averaging is advised. In the following we will focus on two
UDV measurements that were both taken at a propeller
rotation rate of 1200 rpm, and which represent a time
average over half a minute.

The ﬁrst measurement concerns the axial velocity
along the central vertical axis of the cylinder. This axial
component is easily measured by an ultrasonic transducer
ﬂash mounted to the bottom of the cylinder. Figure 6
shows the results of the UDV measurement (up to the
propeller position), together with the results of the CIFT
measurement. For both upward and downward pump-
ing we see a reasonable correspondence of both measure-
ments. Notably, CIFT exhibits the diﬀerent axial de-
pendencies that are typical for upward and downward
pumping and which are conﬁrmed by the UDV data.

The second measurement, which concerns the az-
imuthal velocity component, deserves some explanation.
Figure 7 shows the UDV measurement set-up. The axial
position is at 70 mm from the bottom. What is actu-
ally measured by UDV is the projection of the velocity
onto the ultrasound beam along the chord. Therefore,
the measured signal is in general a mixture of the radial
and azimuthal velocity components. Only in the middle
of the chord we get a signal that originates purely from
the azimuthal velocity. In Figs. 7 (a) and (b) we illus-

trate the measured data that are shown in Fig. 8.

the case of downward pumping the velocity is dominated
by the rotation whereas for upward pumping it is domi-
nated by the radial part. In the middle of the chord we
infer a mean azimuthal velocity of 0.58 m/s for downward
pumping and -0.05 m/s for upward pumping.

Do these UDV values agree with those obtained by
CIFT? In Fig. 9 we show the axial dependence of the
azimuthal velocity at a radial position r=30 mm, as ob-
tained by CIFT during a measurement time of 6 sec-
onds. We give here the individual values at six diﬀerent
azimuthal positions (small crosses and squares). Inter-
estingly, though the system is in general axisymmetric,
non-axisymmetric ﬂuctuations are still visible. The av-
erages (large crosses and squares) over the six azimuthal
positions show, at an axial position of z=70 mm, a good
agreement with the data from UDV measurement.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

To summarize, we have put into practice a ﬁrst version
of contactless inductive ﬂow tomography, using two or-
thogonal imposed magnetic ﬁelds. The comparison with
UDV measurements shows that the method provides ro-
bust results on the main structure and the amplitude
of the velocity ﬁeld. A particular power of CIFT con-
sists in a transient resolution of the full three-dimensional
ﬂow structure in steps of several seconds. Hence, slowly

changing ﬂow ﬁelds in various processes can be followed
in time. Due to its weakness the externally applied mag-
netic ﬁeld does not inﬂuence the ﬂow to be measured.
However, CIFT is also possible in cases where stronger
magnetic ﬁelds are already present for the purpose of ﬂow
control, as, e.g., the electromagnetic brake in steel cast-
ing or the DC-ﬁeld components in silicon crystal growth.
Obviously, the future of the method lays with applying
AC ﬁelds with diﬀerent frequencies in order to improve
the depth resolution of the velocity ﬁeld. For problems
with higher Rm, including dynamos, the inverse prob-
lem becomes non-linear, and more sophisticated inversion
methods must be applied to infer the velocity structure
from magnetic ﬁeld data. Although interesting results
have been obtained by employing Evolutionary Strate-
gies to inverse spectral dynamo problems [12], and ﬁrst
tests of such inversion schemes for the data from the Riga
dynamo experiment have shown promising results, the
general inverse dynamo topic is extremely complicated
and goes essentially beyond the scope of the present pa-
per.

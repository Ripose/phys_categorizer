Abstract

Sonoluminescence is a phenomenon involving the transduction of sound into light.
The detailed mechanism as well as the energy-focusing potentials are not yet fully
explored and understood. So far only optical photons are observed, while emissions
in the ultra-violet range are only inferred. By doping the ﬂuorescent dye quinine
into water with dilute sulphuric acid, the high energy photons can be converted
into the optical photons with slower decay constants. These sonoluminescence and
ﬂuorescent emissions were observed in coincidence, and the emitted energy of the
two modes can be diﬀerentiated by their respective timing proﬁles. Plans for using
this technique as a diagnostic tool to quantitatively study ultra-violet and other
high energy emissions in sonoluminescence are discussed.

Keywords : Sonoluminescence, Ultrasonics, Fluorescence.

1 Introduction

Sonoluminescence (SL) are ﬂashes of light emissions due to collapsing ultrasound-
driven bubbles. Stable Single-Bubble Sonoluminescence (SBSL)[1, 2] was discovered
in 1989 and have been under active studies. The detailed physics responsible for SL
emissions as well the potentials and limitations for achieving very high temperatures
are not fully explored and understood.

The detectable emissions from SBSL are so far restricted to the optical range
(200 nm to 700 nm), the only window in the electromagnetic spectrum where water
becomes transparent. In addition, the typical sensitive range for photo-multipliers
(PMTs) commonly used in SL detection is >300 nm and peaks at ∼400 nm. Spectral
analysis[3] suggested a temperature of 25000 K if the spectrum would follow that for
black-body radiations. However, since only the tail of the black-body spectrum is
measure-able, there are substantial uncertainties in the temperature derivation. The
same data in Ref. [3] was interpreted by other author to indicate a temperature of
40000 K[2]. In this case, the dominant energy fraction of the SBSL emissions should
be in the ultra-violet (UV) range (<300 nm), such that most energy from SBSL
would be absorbed in the water and remains undetected. Still, the black-body model
does not give the complete description since it fails to explain the lack of dependence
of the pulse width to wavelength[2, 4]. In addition, there are recent controversial
claims of tritium and neutron emissions from SL on deuterated-acetone [5] which,
if conﬁrmed, would indicate that the nuclear reaction temperatures of the order of
107 K can be achieved. In addition, existence of plasma at the inner core of the
collapsing bubbles in SBSL with sulphuric acid was recently demonstrated [6], from
which the derived temperature was 8000−15000 K.

It is therefore important to devise methods to experimentally probe the UV and
other high energy emissions and to quantitatively measure the photon energy emit-
ted. Measurements of the ratio between UV to optical photon energy can provide a
probe to the temperature of the light emitting region.

This article describes the ﬁrst step in our research eﬀorts to address this question.
The key ingredient is to dope the water with a ﬂuorescent materials such that the
energy of the UV emissions is converted (or “wavelength-shifted”) to ﬂuorescent
light (FL) in the optical range which can then traverse the water to be detected
by PMTs. Observations of such FL emissions in SBSL were implicit in a previous
study[7] where the emphasis were on the eﬀect of active solutes to bubble dynamics
and, in particular, the emission spectra.
It was shown, averaging over a larger
number of events, that the spectra emitted by SBSL in water doped with pyranine

2

is shifted to peak at green (520 nm). The focus on this work is to study the timing
proﬁles of the light emissions which can be done in an event-by-event basis.

2 Experimental Set-Up

Most commonly used ﬂuorescent dye with large light yields are not readily soluble
in water or inorganic solvent. They are typically dissolved in organic solvent like
xylene or pseudo-cumene to function as liquid scintillators for the detection of high
energy radiations. The ﬂuorescent dye quinine (chemical formula: C20H24N2O2) was
selected for our investigations since it readily dissolves in water mixed with dilute
acid. The absorption and emission spectra of quinine are depicted in Figure 1, where
the transparent range of water through 5 cm of water is also overlaid. Quinine in
an acidic media is used as standards of ﬂuorescent yield determinations.
In our
measurements, 1 g of quinine was dissolved in water mixed with 0.5 M(mole per
liter) of dilute (that is, about 0.9%) sulphuric acid. It has been checked that this
small admixture of sulphuric acid to water does not change observably the light
yields and pulse shapes in SBSL, relative to those from pure water. Accordingly,
we use “water” to denote 0.5 M dilute sulphuric acid for simplicity reasons in this
article.

The schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is displayed in Figure 2. The
standard SL conﬁgurations, gas manifold and water processing procedures[1] were
adopted. The resonator was a spherical ﬂask 6.4 cm in diameter, driven by two piezo-
electric (PZT) oscillators at the resonance frequency of about 25.5 kHz through a
function generator and power ampliﬁer. A third PZT attached to the ﬂask func-
tioned as microphone monitoring the shock waves generated during bubble collapse.

Pure water was ﬁrst degassed in a beaker inside a vacuum chamber, and a con-
trolled gas composition was introduced while the beaker was stirred so that the
water was in equilibrium with the gas content, where 10% air was used in this
measurement. Sulphuric acid was added to the prepared water and quinine was
subsequently dissolved into it. The liquid was placed in the resonator ﬂask in a
light-tight refrigerator box with temperature control between 0oC and 20oC. The
seed of the bubble was generated by a NiCr heating wire.

The light emission were detected by PMTs located directly outside the ﬂask.
The rise time of the PMT is about 2 ns, while the bialkaline photo-cathode has a
maximal quantum eﬃciency at blue (420 nm). Images from a CCD camera provided
independent visual checks. Output from the function generator, ampliﬁer, micro-

3

phone and the PMT were all monitored with oscilloscope to ensure stability and
that the proper phase relations were maintained. Besides these standard set-up, a
cosmic-ray telescope (CRT) consisting of two 7X6X3 cm3 plastic scintillator panels
read out by PMTs were installed on top and bottom of the resonator ﬂask. Events
triggered by the CRT were used to study the characteristics of FL emissions.

The PMT pulse signal were recorded via a digital oscilloscope at 2.5 GHz sam-
pling rate. An event-by-event data acquisition was performed, at a rate of about
5 Hz. The data were transferred from the oscilloscope via a GPIB-USB interface to
a PC using the commercial LabView data acquisition software package. The total
light yield is proportional to the integrated sum of the PMT signals.

3 Observations of Fluorescence Emissions

Light emissions from SBSL in water and in quinine-doped water were measured. The
PMT signal proﬁles of individual events were measured. The pulse shapes reported
in this Section are from the averaging over 1000 events.

The measured pulse shape for prompt SL emissions in water (ΦSL) is shown
in Figure 3a. The SL emissions are expected to be extremely fast at the 100 ps
range[4, 8], such that the measured shape of ΦSL in the ns scale reﬂects the response
time of the PMT.

The pulse shape that corresponds to pure FL emissions (ΦFL) is also displayed
in Figure 3a.
It was obtained when the oscilloscope was triggered by the CRT
while quinine-doped water was placed in the ﬂask. Cosmic-ray events give rise
to FL emissions in quinine-doped water, due to (a) ionization and excitation of
the water molecules which transfer the energy to the quinine molecules leading to
decays by ﬂuorescence, and (b) absorption of the Cherenkov light by the quinine.
The measured pulse shape is therefore dominated by the FL process. The decay
time for ΦFL is slower than that for ΦSL, which is determined by the energy transfer
and ﬂuorescent processes in the quinine-doped water.

The observed pulse shape for SBSL emissions in quinine-doped water (ΦTot), is
shown in Figure 3b. The pulse consists of a fast component due to SL emissions,
together with a slow component from the secondary FL due to absorption of the
UV and high energy primary emissions. That is, one can express the proﬁle by:

where (α, β) represent the relative light yields between the optical SL and FL emis-

ΦTot = α · ΦSL + β · ΦFL ,

sions. It was adopted that ΦSL and ΦFL were normalized by the same amplitude,
from which the ratio of their integrated area was ΦSL : ΦFL = 1 : 3, as shown in
Figure 3a. At the reference conditions of 10% air in water and a temperature of
3oC, the ratio of β : α = 0.25 was derived by pulse shape analysis. The relative
contributions between the two components were therefore (α·ΦSL) : (β ·ΦFL) = 4 : 3,
as illustrated in Figure 3b.

4 Research Plans

We have devised and demonstrated a method to convert the UV photons to observ-
able optical signals which can be deconvoluted from the primary SL emissions. This
technique allows quantitative studies on the emissions of high-energy radiations in
Single-Bubble as well as Multi-Bubble Sonoluminescence which may shed lights on
its underlying physics mechanism.

After proper calibrations, the measured (α, β) values can be translated to a ratio
of energy output between UV and optical photons. This can be used to test and
diﬀerentiate black-body and other theoretical models in SBSL[2, 9]. In the case of
black-body spectra, the temperature at the light-emitting surface can be obtained,
and this can be compared to that derived from the measurement of the optical
spectra[3].

Systematic studies can be done with varying ambient conditions like temper-
ature, gas and liquid compositions, and the acoustic pressure, to investigate the
dependence of the α : β ratio. In particular, in the quest of identifying appropriate
operating parameters which may favor higher temperature emissions in SL, a direct
probe of the high energy radiations will be extremely essential.

Towards these ends, research eﬀorts are pursued to devise the calibration schemes
and to improve on the experimental hardware. In particular, a 2 GHz 4-channel
Sampling Analog Digital Convertor running on VME-bus and Linus Operating Sys-
tem will be installed to replace the oscilloscope readout. This will make eﬃcient
event-by-event data taking with massive data ﬂow possible. Large data samples will
allow the studies of the distributions of (α, β), from which one can investigate if
anomalous events may occur with small but ﬁnite probabilities.

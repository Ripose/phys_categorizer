Abstract

Diﬀerent mechanisms believed to be responsible for the generation of bursts
in hydrodynamical systems are reviewed and a new mechanism capable of
generating regular or irregular bursts of large dynamic range near threshold
is described. The new mechanism is present in the interaction between os-
cillatory modes of odd and even parity in systems of large but ﬁnite aspect
ratio, and provides an explanation for the bursting behavior observed in
binary ﬂuid convection. Additional applications of the new mechanism are
proposed.

Introduction

Bursts of activity, be they regular or irregular, are a common oc-
currence in physical and biological systems. In recent years several
models of bursting behavior in hydrodynamical systems have been
described using ideas from dynamical systems theory. In this arti-
cle we review these and then describe a new mechanism (Moehlis &
Knobloch [1, 2], Knobloch & Moehlis [3]) which provides an explana-
tion for the bursting behavior observed in experiments on convection
in 3He/4He mixtures by Sullivan & Ahlers [4]. This mechanism ope-
rates naturally in systems with broken D4 symmetry undergoing a

Hopf bifurcation from a trivial state. This symmetry, the symmetry
group of a square, may be present because of the geometry of the
system under consideration (for example, the shape of the container)
but also appears in large aspect ratio systems with reﬂection sym-
metry (Landsberg & Knobloch [5]). In either case bursting arises as
a result of the nonlinear interaction between two nearly degenerate
modes with diﬀerent symmetries.

This article is an expanded version of Knobloch & Moehlis [6].

2 Mechanisms producing bursting

As detailed further below, bursts come in many diﬀerent forms, dis-
tinguished by their dynamic range (i.e., the range of amplitudes dur-
ing each burst), duration, and recurrence properties. Particularly
important for the purposes of the present article is the question of
whether the observed bursts occur close to the threshold of a primary
instability or whether they are found far from threshold. In the for-
mer case a dynamical systems approach is likely to be successful: in
this regime the spatial structure usually resembles the eigenfunctions
of the linear problem and it is likely that only a small number of
degrees of freedom participate in the burst. Such bursts take place
fundamentally in the time domain with their spatial manifestation
of secondary importance, in contrast to pulses which are structures
localized in both time and space; the latter are not considered here.
Since the equations governing the evolution of primary instabilities
are often highly symmetric (see Crawford & Knobloch [7]) global bi-
furcations are likely to occur and these serve as potential candidates
for bursting mechanisms. In contrast, bursts found far from threshold
usually involve many degrees of freedom but even here some progress
is sometimes possible.

2.1 Bursts in the wall region of a turbulent boundary

layer

The presence of coherent structures in a turbulent boundary layer is
well established (see, e.g., Robinson [8] and the collection of articles

edited by Panton [9]). The space-time evolution of these structures
is often characterized by intermittent bursting events involving low
speed streamwise “streaks” of ﬂuid. Speciﬁcally, let x1, x2, and x3 be
the streamwise, wall normal, and spanwise directions with associated
velocity components U + u1, u2, and u3, respectively; here U (x2) is
the mean ﬂow. In a “burst” the streak breaks up and low speed ﬂuid
moves upward away from the wall (u1 < 0, u2 > 0); this is followed
by a “sweep” in which fast ﬂuid moves downward towards the wall
(u1 > 0, u2 < 0). After the burst/sweep cycle the streak reforms,
often with a lateral spanwise shift.

A low-dimensional model of the burst/sweep cycle was developed
by Aubry et al. [10]; further details and later references may be found
in Holmes et al. [11, 12]. To construct such a model the authors used
a Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition of the data to identify an energet-
ically dominant empirical set of eigenfunctions, hereafter “modes”.
The original study of Aubry et al. [10] used experimental data for
pipe ﬂow with Re ∼ 6750, while later studies used data for chan-
nel ﬂow from direct numerical simulation with Re ∼ 3000 − 4000
and large eddy simulations with Re ∼ 13800 (Holmes et al. [12]).
The model was constructed by projecting the Navier-Stokes equation
onto this basis and consists of a set of coupled ODEs for the ampli-
tudes of these modes. The ﬁxed points of these equations are to be
associated with the presence of coherent structures. There are two
types, related by half-wavelength spanwise translation.

Numerical integration of the model reveals that these ﬁxed points
are typically unstable and that they are connected by a heteroclinic
cycle. In such a cycle the trajectory alternately visits the vicinities
of the two unstable ﬁxed points. In the model of Aubry et al.
[10]
this heteroclinic cycle is found to be structurally stable, i.e., it per-
sists over a range of parameter values. This is a consequence of the
O(2) symmetry of the equations inherited from periodic boundary
conditions in the spanwise direction. Moreover, for the parameter
values of interest this cycle is attracting, i.e., it attracts all nearby
trajectories. Since the transition from one ﬁxed point to the other
corresponds to a spanwise translation by half a wavelength, the re-

current excursions along such a heteroclinic cycle can be identiﬁed
with the burst/sweep cycle described above. However, since this cy-
cle is attracting, the time between successive bursts will increase as
time progresses. This is not observed and Aubry et al. [10] appeal
to the presence of a random pressure term modeling the eﬀect of the
outer ﬂuid layer to kick the trajectory from the heteroclinic cycle. In
the language of Busse [13] such a pressure term results in a statisti-
cal
limit cycle, with the bursting events occurring randomly in time
but with a well-deﬁned mean rate. The resulting temporal distribu-
tion of the burst events is characterized by a strong exponential tail,
matching experimental observations.

Attracting structurally stable heteroclinic cycles occur in a num-
ber of problems of this type, i.e., mode interaction problems with
O(2) symmetry (Armbruster et al. [14], Proctor & Jones [15], Mel-
bourne et al. [16], Steindl & Troger [17], Krupa [18], Hirschberg &
Knobloch [19]).

2.2 Bursts in shear ﬂows undergoing subcritical tran-

sition to turbulence

Experimental studies of plane Couette ﬂow and Poiseuille (pipe) ﬂow
have shown that at high enough values of the Reynolds number Re the
basic laminar ﬂow becomes turbulent. However, these laminar ﬂows
are linearly stable at all Re (see, e.g., Drazin & Reid [20]). Con-
sequently, the transition to turbulence in these systems must arise
from ﬁnite (i.e., not inﬁnitesimal) perturbations to the basic ﬂow;
such transitions are called subcritical since the turbulent state exists
for values of Re for which the laminar state is stable. Much recent
work (reviewed in Baggett & Trefethen [21]) has emphasized the im-
portance of the fact that the linear operators L governing the evolu-
tion of perturbations of these ﬂows are non-normal, i.e., L†L 6= LL†,
where L† is the adjoint of L. Linear systems with a non-normal L
can exhibit transient growth even though the laminar state is linearly
stable; if the growth is large enough, nonlinearities in the system may
then trigger a transition to turbulence. Analysis of low-dimensional
models supported by numerical simulations suggests that the mini-

mum perturbation amplitude ǫ that results in turbulence scales as
ǫ = O(Reα) for some α < −1 (Baggett & Trefethen [21]). Thus, ǫ
decreases rapidly with increasing Re, and the experimentally deter-
mined Re for transition should be that value at which ǫ is roughly
equal to perturbations due to noise or imperfections in the system.

The turbulence excited by ﬁnite amplitude perturbations in shear
ﬂows often takes the form of turbulent spots which can move, grow,
split, and merge (see, e.g., Daviaud et al. [22]). Turbulent spots can
also burst intermittently. For example, Bottin et al. [23] observed
intermittent turbulent bursts in plane Couette ﬂow for Re ≈ 325;
these bursts were triggered by a spanwise wire through the center of
the channel, and could be localized in space by introducing a bead
into the central plane. We focus here on this burst-like behavior, also
found in low-dimensional models of the subcritical transition to tur-
bulence. The important issue in such models is the attractor to which
the ﬂow settles after an appropriate ﬁnite perturbation to the basic
laminar ﬂow. This will depend crucially on nonlinear terms in the
equations, a point emphasized, for example, by Waleﬀe [24, 25, 26, 27]
and Dauchot & Manneville [28]. If this attractor is a ﬁxed point, the
system settles into a steady state in which bursts do not occur. On
the other hand, if this attractor is a limit cycle it may be appro-
priate to interpret the resulting behavior as burst-like. This is the
case in the model studied in Waleﬀe [24] in which the amplitudes of
streamwise streaks, streamwise rolls, and the streak instability can
periodically undergo short-lived explosive growths at the expense of
the mean shear. Waleﬀe [24, 25] refers to this as a self-sustaining
process. Since the laminar state is linearly stable, such limit cycles
cannot bifurcate oﬀ the laminar state.
Instead, as pointed out in
Waleﬀe [25, 26], they may be born in a Hopf bifurcation (from a
ﬁxed point other than that corresponding to the laminar state) or
a homoclinic bifurcation in which a trajectory homoclinic to a ﬁxed
point forms at some value of Re such that for smaller (larger) values
of Re a limit cycle exists (does not exist), or vice versa. Near such
a homoclinic bifurcation, bursts are expected because the trajectory
spends a long time near the ﬁxed point, bursting away and return-

ing in a periodic or chaotic fashion, depending on the eigenvalues of
the ﬁxed point. Other generic codimension one bifurcations leading
to the appearance or disappearance of limit cycles are saddle-node
bifurcations of limit cycles and saddle-nodes in which a pair of ﬁxed
points appears on the limit cycle (Guckenheimer et al. [29]). Limit
cycles could also come in from or go oﬀ to inﬁnity. In other models
chaotic attractors have been found (see, e.g., Gebhardt & Grossman
[30] and Baggett et al. [31]) and these may also give rise to burst-like
behavior.

The relation of the bursts described in this section (which occur
for moderate values of Re, e.g., Re ≈ 325) to those which occur in
the turbulent boundary layer (which occur for high values of Re) is
not completely clear. However, the similarities in the phenomenology
have led Waleﬀe [27] to propose that the self-sustaining process will
continue to have importance in the near-wall region of high Re ﬂows.

2.3 Heteroclinic connections to inﬁnity

Another mechanism involving heteroclinic connections, distinct from
that discussed in section 2.1, has been investigated by Newell et
al. [32, 33] as a possible model for spatio-temporal intermittency
in turbulent ﬂow. The authors suggest that such systems may be
viewed as nearly Hamiltonian except during periods of localized in-
tense dissipation. A related “punctuated Hamiltonian” approach to
the evolution of two-dimensional turbulence has met with consider-
able success (Carnevale et al. [34] and Weiss & McWilliams [35]).
For their description Newell et al. divide the instantaneous states of
the ﬂow into two categories, a turbulent soup (TS) characterized by
weak coherence, and a singular (S) state characterized by strong co-
herence, and suppose that the TS and S states are generalized saddles
in an appropriate phase space. Furthermore, they suppose that in the
Hamiltonian limit the unstable manifold of TS (S) intersects transver-
sally the stable manifold of S (TS). If the constant energy surfaces are
noncompact (i.e., unbounded), the evolution of the Hamiltonian sys-
tem may take the system into regions of phase space with very high
(“inﬁnite”) velocities and small scales. These regions are identiﬁed

with the S states and high dissipation. In such a scenario the strong
dissipation events are therefore identiﬁed with excursions along hete-
roclinic connections to inﬁnity. Perturbations to the system (such as
the addition of dissipative processes) may prevent the trajectory from
actually reaching inﬁnity, but this underlying unperturbed structure
implies that large excursions are still possible.

Newell et al. apply these ideas to the two-dimensional nonlin-
ear Schr¨odinger equation (NLSE) with perturbations in the form of
special driving and dissipative terms which act at large and small
scales, respectively. Here S consists of “ﬁlament” solutions to the un-
perturbed NLSE which become singular in ﬁnite time and represent
coherent structures which may occur at any position in the ﬂow ﬁeld.
When the solution is near S a large portion of the energy is in small
scales; for the perturbed equations the dissipative term then becomes
important so that the ﬁlament solution is approached but collapses
before it is reached. This leads to a spatially and temporally random
occurrence of localized burst-like events for the perturbed equation.
The rate of attraction at S is determined by the faster than expo-
nential rate at which the ﬁlament becomes singular, while the rate
of repulsion at S is governed by the dissipative process and hence is
unrelated to the rate of attraction.

This bursting mechanism shares characteristics with that de-
scribed in Kaplan et al. [36] in which solutions of a single complex
Ginzburg-Landau equation with periodic boundary conditions un-
dergo faster than exponential bursting due to a destabilizing non-
linearity and collapse due to strong nonlinear dispersion (see also
Bretherton & Spiegel [37]). A study of a generalization of Burger’s
equation modeling nonlocality eﬀects suggests the presence of burst-
like events through a similar scenario (Makarenko et al. [38]).

2.4 Bursts in the Kolmogorov ﬂow

The Kolmogorov ﬂow u = (k sin ky, 0) is an exact solution of the
two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with unidi-
rectional forcing f at wavenumber k: f = (νk3 sin ky, 0). With in-
creasing Reynolds number Re ≡ ν−1 this ﬂow becomes unstable,

and direct numerical simulation with 2π-periodic boundary condi-
tions shows that for moderately high Reynolds numbers and k > 1
the resulting ﬂow is characterized by intermittent bursting (She [39],
[44, 45, 46]).
Nicolaenko & She [40, 41, 42, 43], Armbruster et al.
A burst occurs when the system evolves from a coherent vortex-like
modulated traveling wave (MW) to a spatially disordered state fol-
lowing transfer of energy from large to small scales. The system then
relaxes to the vicinity of another symmetry-related MW state, and
the process continues with bursts occurring irregularly but with a
well-deﬁned mean period.

The details of what actually happens appear to depend on the
value of k because k determines the symmetry of the nonlinear equa-
tion describing the evolution of the perturbation streamfunction φ
about the Kolmogorov ﬂow. Although there is no compelling reason
for it, all simulations of this equation have been performed with 2π-
periodic boundary conditions in both directions. With these boun-
dary conditions this equation has a symmetry which is the semi-
direct product of the dihedral group D2k (generated by the actions
(x, y, φ) → (−x, −y, φ) and (x, y, φ) → (−x, y + π/k, −φ)) and the
group SO(2) (representing the symmetry under translations x →
x+const). In the simplest case, k = 1, this symmetry group is iso-
morphic to the direct product of the group O(2) of rotations and
reﬂections of a circle and the group Z2 representing reﬂections in the
y-direction. Unfortunately, when k = 1 the Kolmogorov ﬂow with
2π-periodic boundary conditions is not unstable for any value of Re
(Meshalkin & Sinai [47], Green [48], Marchioro [49]), and one is forced
to consider k > 1. Armbruster et al. [46] analyzed carefully the k = 2
case and showed that while a heteroclinic cycle between the MW
states does form, it is not structurally stable; the bursts are therefore
not produced by a mechanism of the type described in section 2.1. It
is possible, however, that the onset of bursting is associated with a
symmetry-increasing bifurcation at Re ≡ Res (see, e.g., Rucklidge &
Matthews [50]). This would explain why the system stays in a single
MW state for Re just below Res but visits the vicinity of diﬀerent
but symmetry-related MW states for Re just above Res. However,

despite much work a detailed understanding of the bursts in this sys-
tem remains elusive.

An alternative approach is to consider periodic domains with
diﬀerent periodicities in the two directions. In particular, if we con-
sider the domain {−π < x ≤ π, −π/k < y ≤ π/k} with k > 1 the
symmetry group remains O(2)×Z2 but suﬃciently long perturbations
now grow. The unstable modes are either even or odd under the re-
ﬂection (x, y) → (−x, −y) with respect to a suitable origin. Mode
interaction between these two steady modes can result in a sequence
of transitions summarized in ﬁgure 1 (Hirschberg & Knobloch [19]):
the Kolmogorov ﬂow loses stability to an even mode (Z), followed by
a steady state bifurcation to a mixed parity state (MMπ/2). Since
each of these states is deﬁned to within a translation in x modulo 2π,
we say that it forms a circle of states. The MMπ/2 state then loses
stability in a further steady state bifurcation to a traveling wave
(TW) which in turn loses stability at a Hopf bifurcation to a MW.
The MW two-torus terminates in a collision with the two circles of
pure parity states, forming an attracting structurally stable hetero-
clinic cycle connecting them and their quarter-wavelength translates
(Hirschberg & Knobloch [19]). In this regime the behavior would re-
semble that found in the numerical simulations, with higher modes
Indeed this sequence of
kicking the system away from this cycle.
transitions echoes the results obtained by She [39] and Nicolaenko &
She [40, 41, 42, 43] for k = 8. While it is likely that the k = 1 sce-
nario is relevant to these calculations because of the tendency towards
an inverse cascade in these two-dimensional systems, we emphasize
that, as mentioned above, a careful analysis of the k = 2 case by
Armbruster et al. [46] shows that while a heteroclinic cycle of the
required type does indeed form, it is not structurally stable. The
case k = 4 has also been studied (Platt et al. [51]) and a similar
sequence of transitions found. Undoubtedly simulations on the do-
main {−π < x ≤ π, −π/k < y ≤ π/k} would shed new light on the
problem, cf. Posch & Hoover [52].

The group O(2)×Z2 also arises in convection in rotating straight
channels (Knobloch [53]) and in natural convection in a vertical slot

(Xin et al. [54]). In both of these cases the linear eigenfunctions are
either even or odd with respect to a rotation by π and the systems ex-
hibit similar transitions. Related behavior has recently been observed
in three-dimensional magnetoconvection with periodic boundary con-
ditions on a square lattice. Unlike the Kolmogorov ﬂow the evolution
equation describing a steady state secondary instability of a square
pattern is isotropic in the horizontal. Numerical simulations (Ruck-
lidge et al. [55]) show intermittent breakdown of a square pattern
followed by its restoration modulo translation.

2.5 Bursts in the Taylor-Couette system

The Taylor-Couette system consists of concentric cylinders enclos-
ing a ﬂuid-ﬁlled annulus (see, e.g., Tagg [56]). The cylinders can be
rotated independently. In the counterrotating regime the ﬁrst state
consists of spiral vortices of either odd or even parity with respect to
midheight. Slightly above onset the ﬂow resembles interpenetrating

spiral (IPS) ﬂow which may be intermittently interrupted by bursts
of turbulence which ﬁll the entire ﬂow ﬁeld (Hamill [57], Coughlin et
al. [58, 59]). With periodic boundary conditions in the axial direction
numerical simulations by Coughlin et al. [58, 59] show that the IPS
ﬂow is temporally chaotic and consists of coexisting modes with diﬀer-
ent axial and azimuthal wavenumbers. This ﬂow is conﬁned primarily
to the vicinity of the inner cylinder where the axisymmetric base ﬂow
is subject to an inviscid Rayleigh instability. Coughlin et al. [58, 59]
conclude that the onset of turbulence is correlated with a secondary
instability of one of the coexisting modes of the IPS ﬂow, namely the
basic spiral vortex ﬂow with azimuthal wavenumber m = 4. Indeed,
when this mode is taken as the initial ﬂow for parameters chosen such
that the full IPS ﬂow undergoes bursts, a secondary Hopf bifurcation
from this state with the same azimuthal wavenumber but four times
the axial wavelength is identiﬁed. The secondary instability grows
in amplitude and ultimately provides a ﬁnite amplitude perturbation
to the inviscidly stable ﬂow near the outer cylinder, triggering a tur-
bulent burst throughout the whole apparatus. During a burst small
scales are generated throughout the apparatus leading to a rapid col-
lapse of the turbulence and restoration of the IPS ﬂow; the bursting
process then repeats roughly periodically in time (see ﬁgure 2).

As discussed in section 3.1, in a ﬁnite Taylor-Couette apparatus
there is a natural mechanism for generating bursts close to onset.
This mechanism operates in the regime ǫ ∼ Γ−2, where ǫ measures
the fractional distance above threshold for the primary instability
and Γ is the aspect ratio of the annulus (Landsberg & Knobloch [5],
Renardy [60]). For larger ǫ the inﬂuence of the boundaries no longer
extends throughout the apparatus and is conﬁned to boundary layers
near the top and bottom. In this regime the dynamics in the bulk
may be described by imposing periodic boundary conditions with pe-
riod that is a multiple of the wavelength of the primary instability.
The success of the simulation of the observed turbulent bursts using
such periodic boundary conditions (Coughlin et al. [58, 59]) suggests
that these bursts occur too far above threshold to be explained by
the mechanism described in section 3.1 below. This suggestion is sup-

penetrating spiral state (top), just before a burst (middle), and in

ported by ﬁgure 3 which compares the location of the regime where
this mechanism may be expected to operate with ǫb, the experimen-
tal value of ǫ for the onset of bursts, as a function of Γ. The latter
is obtained using the approximation ǫb ≈ (Rb − RIP S)/RIP S, where
RIP S and Rb are the inner cylinder Reynolds numbers for the onset
of IPS ﬂow and bursts, and

RIP S = (3837 ± 374)Γ−1 + 680 ± 14

Figure 3: The solid line shows the inner cylinder reduced Reynolds
number ǫb for the onset of bursts obtained from data in Hamill [57].
The dashed line shows the estimate ǫ = Γ−2 near and below which the
asymptotic bursting mechanism described in section 3.1 is expected
to apply. The bursts found at Γ = 17.9 and Γ = 26 (Hamill [57],
[59]) apparently fall outside the range of validity of
Coughlin et al.
the theory of section 3.1.

(Hamill [57]). This is a good approximation for strongly counterrotat-
ing cylinders because the IPS ﬂow sets in for inner cylinder Reynolds
number only about 1% above the primary onset to spiral vortices
(Hamill [57]). The ﬁgure suggests that the observed bursts may fall
within the range of validity of this theory for Γ only slightly smaller
than those used in the experiments (Γ = 17.9, 26); for such bursts
the presence of endwalls should become signiﬁcant.

2.6 Intermittency

The term intermittency refers to occasional, non-periodic switching
between diﬀerent types of behavior; such transitions may be viewed
as bursts. In this section we describe diﬀerent types of intermittency,
dividing them into three classes.

2.6.1 Low-dimensional intermittency

It is often the case that ﬂuid dynamical systems may be modelled
by low-dimensional Poincar´e maps. Fixed points of such maps corre-
spond to limit cycles of an appropriate dynamical system; when these

lose stability intermittency may result. Without loss of generality we
assume that for λ < λp the system is in a “laminar” state correspond-
ing to a stable ﬁxed point of the map, and the onset of intermittency
occurs at λ = λp. For λ > λp the state of the system will resemble
the stable laminar state which existed for λ < λp for some time but
will intermittently undergo “bursts” away from this state, followed
by “reinjections” to the vicinity of the laminar state. The three types
of intermittency identiﬁed by Pomeau & Manneville [61] correspond
to three diﬀerent ways in which the laminar state ceases to exist or
loses stability at λ = λp: Type I intermittency results when a sta-
ble and unstable limit cycle annihilate in a saddle-node bifurcation,
Type II results when the limit cycle loses stability in a subcritical
Hopf bifurcation, while in Type III the limit cycle loses stability in
an inverse period-doubling bifurcation. Type I and Type III intermit-
tency have been observed, for example, in Rayleigh-B´enard convec-
tion (see Berg´e et al. [62] and Dubois et al. [63], respectively), while
Type II intermittency has been observed in a hot wire experiment
(Ringuet et al. [64]). A diﬀerent type of intermittency, called Type
X, was observed by Price & Mullin [65] in a variant of the Taylor-
Couette system; this is similar to Type I intermittency but involves
a hysteretic transition due to the nature of the reinjection. Another
type of intermittency, called Type V, was introduced in Bauer et al.
[66] and He et al.
[67]; this is similar in spirit to Type I intermit-
tency but involves one-dimensional maps which are nondiﬀerentiable
or discontinuous. These diﬀerent types of intermittency have distinct
properties, such as the scaling behavior of the average time between
bursts with λ − λp.

2.6.2 Crisis-induced intermittency

A crisis is a sudden change in a strange attractor as a parameter is
varied (Grebogi et al.
[68, 69, 70]). There are three types of crises,
and without loss of generality we assume that the crisis occurs as λ is
increased through λc. In a boundary crisis, at λ = λc the strange at-
tractor collides with a coexisting unstable periodic orbit which lies on
the boundary of the basin of attraction of the strange attractor. This

leads to the destruction of the strange attractor, but chaotic tran-
sients will still exist. Intermittency is not associated with this crisis.
In an interior crisis the strange attractor collides with a coexisting
unstable periodic orbit at λ = λc, but here this leads to a widening
rather than the destruction of the strange attractor. For λ slightly
larger than λc the trajectory stays near the region of phase space
occupied by the strange attractor before the crisis for long times, but
intermittently bursts into a new region. In an attractor merging crisis
two strange attractors with basins of attraction separated by a basin
boundary are present when λ < λc. At λc the two strange attrac-
tors simultaneously touch the basin boundary and “merge” to form
a larger strange attractor for λ > λc. Such a crisis is often associated
with a symmetry-increasing bifurcation (Chossat & Golubitsky [71]).
For λ > λc there is a single strange attractor on which the trajec-
tory intermittently switches between states resembling the distinct
strange attractors which existed for λ < λc.

2.6.3

Intermittency involving an invariant manifold

A manifold in phase space is invariant if every initial condition on the
manifold generates an orbit that remains on the manifold. Invariant
manifolds often exist due to symmetries, but this is not necessary.
There are several mechanisms for intermittency involving strange at-
tractors on an invariant manifold.

First, suppose that as a bifurcation parameter λ is increased
through λp, the strange attractor on the invariant manifold loses
stability transverse to the manifold; this is called a blowout bifur-
cation (Ott & Sommerer [72]). Suppose that the dynamics within
the invariant subspace do not depend on λ. Such a system thus has
[73]), and λ is called a nor-
a skew-product structure (Platt et al.
mal parameter (Ashwin et al.
If the blowout bifurcation is
[74]).
“supercritical” (Ott & Sommerer [72]) then for λ just above λp a
trajectory will spend a long time near the invariant manifold, inter-
mittently bursting away from it, only to return due to the presence
of a reinjection mechanism. This scenario is known as on-oﬀ inter-
mittency, where the “oﬀ” (“on”) state corresponds to the system

being near (away from) the invariant manifold (see, e.g., Platt et al.
[73], Venkataramani et al. [75]). Recently it has been shown that in
appropriate circumstances a blowout bifurcation can lead to a struc-
turally stable (possibly attracting) heteroclinic cycle between chaotic
invariant sets (Ashwin & Rucklidge [76]).

For systems which lack a skew-product structure and thus are
governed by non-normal parameters, in-out intermittency is possible
(Ashwin et al. [74], Covas et al. [77]). Here the attraction and repul-
sion to the invariant subspace are controlled by diﬀerent dynamics.
This occurs when the attractor for dynamics restricted to the in-
variant subspace is smaller than the intersection of the attractor for
the full dynamics with the invariant subspace, and may be viewed
as a generalization of on-oﬀ intermittency in which the attraction to
and repulsion from the invariant subspace are controlled by the same
dynamics.

Another mechanism for bursting occurs when the strange attrac-
tor on the invariant manifold attracts typical orbits near the surface
but is unstable in the sense that there are unstable periodic orbits
embedded within the chaotic set which are transversely repelling. If
the trajectory comes near such an unstable periodic orbit, there will
be a burst away from the invariant surface. Such bursts may occur
intermittently if noise is present or small changes (called “mismatch”)
are made to the dynamical system that destroy the invariant surface.
The instability of the ﬁrst of these orbits is known as a bubbling tran-
sition (see, e.g., Ashwin et al. [78], Venkataramani et al. [79, 80]).

2.7 Bursts in neural systems

In neural systems, bursting refers to the switching of an observable
such as a voltage or chemical concentration between an active state
characterized by rapid (spike) oscillations and a rest state. Models
of such bursting typically involve singularly perturbed vector ﬁelds
in which system variables are classiﬁed as being “fast” or “slow”
depending on whether or not they change signiﬁcantly over the du-
ration of a single spike. The slow variables may then be thought of
as slowly varying parameters for the equations describing the fast

variables (Rinzel [81, 82], Bertram et al. [83], Wang & Rinzel [84],
Guckenheimer et al. [29]). As the slow variables evolve, the state of
the system in the fast variables may change from a stable periodic
orbit (corresponding to the active state) to a stable ﬁxed point (cor-
responding to the rest state) and vice versa; such transitions are often
associated with a region of bistability for the periodic orbit and the
ﬁxed point, but need not be. Mechanisms by which such transitions
can occur repeatedly have been classiﬁed (Rinzel [81, 82], Bertram et
al. [83], Wang & Rinzel [84]). Behavior of the time interval between
successive spikes near a transition from the active to the rest state is
discussed by Guckenheimer et al. [29]; in this paper the presence of a
subcritical Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation is also identiﬁed as a possible
mechanism for the transition from an active to a rest state.

3 A new mechanism for bursting

3.1 Description of the mechanism

We now describe a bursting mechanism which involves the interaction
between oscillatory modes in systems with approximate D4 symmetry,
where D4 is the symmetry group of the square. This mechanism can
lead to bursts of large dynamic range very close to the instability
onset (Moehlis & Knobloch [1, 2], Knobloch & Moehlis [3]) and is
expected to be relevant in many diﬀerent systems with approximate
D4 symmetry. This symmetry may be present for obvious or subtle
reasons, as the following discussion demonstrates.

Consider binary ﬂuid convection in a system of large but ﬁnite
aspect ratio. If the separation ratio is suﬃciently negative the sys-
tem is overstable, i.e., the primary instability is via a Hopf bifurca-
tion. This is the case for the 3He/4He mixture used by Sullivan &
Ahlers [4] in their experiment carried out in a rectangular container
D ≡ {x, y, z| − 1
2 } with
Γ = 34, Γy = 6.9. In this experiment Sullivan & Ahlers observed that
immediately above threshold (ǫ ≡ (Ra − Rac)/Rac = 3 × 10−4) con-
vective heat transport may take place in a sequence of irregular bursts
of large dynamic range despite constant heat input (see ﬁgure 4). In

range of the bursts, measured by the range of (N − 1)/ǫ where N
is the Nusselt number, decreases with increasing ǫ while the burst
frequency increases. After Sullivan & Ahlers [4]. Courtesy G. Ahlers.

this system the presence of sidewalls destroys translation symmetry
in the x direction which would be present if the system were un-
bounded, but with identical boundary conditions at the sidewalls the
system retains a reﬂection symmetry about x = 0; the primary modes
are thus either even or odd with respect to this reﬂection (Dangel-
mayr & Knobloch [85]). Numerical simulations of the appropriate
partial diﬀerential equations suggest that the bursts observed in the
experiments involve the interaction between the ﬁrst odd and even
modes of the system (Jacqmin & Heminger [86]; see also Batiste et
al. [87] as described in section 3.2). Thus, to describe the dynamical
behavior near threshold we suppose that the perturbation from the
conduction state takes the form

Ψ(x, y, z, t) = ǫ

1
2 Re {z+(t)f+(x, y, z) + z−(t)f−(x, y, z)} + O(ǫ), (1)

where ǫ ≪ 1, f±(−x, y, z) = ±f±(x, y, z).

Following Landsberg & Knobloch [5] we now derive amplitude
equations describing the evolution of z+ and z− using symmetry ar-
guments. To do this, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the topic of bifurcations
in systems with symmetry (see, e.g., Golubitsky et al. [88] and Craw-
ford & Knobloch [7]). Suppose that

where v ∈ Rn and λ ∈ Rm represent dependent variables and system
parameters, respectively. Let γ ∈ G describe a linear group action
on the dependent variables. We say that if

˙v = f (v, λ),

f (γv, λ) = γf (v, λ)

(2)

(3)

for all γ ∈ G then (2) is equivariant with respect to the group G.
This is equivalent to the statement that if v(t) is a solution to (2)
then so is γv(t). For example, if a system is equivariant under left-
right reﬂections and a right-moving wave exists as a solution, then a
reﬂection-related left-moving wave will also exist as a solution. For
the amplitudes z+ and z− the requirement that a reﬂected state (ob-
tained by letting x → −x in (1)) also be a state of the system gives
the requirement that the amplitude equations be equivariant with
respect to the group action

κ1 : (z+, z−) → (z+, −z−).

(4)

Moreover, as argued by Landsberg & Knobloch [5], the equations
for the formally inﬁnite system cannot distinguish between the two
modes, i.e., in this limit the amplitude equations must also be equiv-
ariant with respect to the group action

κ2 : (z+, z−) → (z−, z+)

(5)

which we call an interchange symmetry. These two operations gen-
erate together the symmetry group D4. For a container with large
but ﬁnite length, this symmetry will be weakly broken; in particular,

the even and odd modes typically become unstable at slightly dif-
ferent Rayleigh numbers and with slightly diﬀerent frequencies (see
section 3.2). The resulting equations are thus close to those for a 1:1
resonance, but with a special structure dictated by the proximity to
D4 symmetry. Finally, we may put the equations for z+ and z− into
normal form by performing a series of near-identity nonlinear trans-
formations of the dependent variables so as to simplify the equations
as much as possible (see, e.g., Guckenheimer & Holmes [89]). The
normal form equations have the additional symmetry (Elphick et al.
[90])

ˆσ : (z+, z−) → eiσ(z+, z−),

σ ∈ [0, 2π),

(6)

which may be interpreted as a phase shift symmetry. Truncating the
resulting equations at third order we obtain

˙z+ = [λ + ∆λ + i(ω + ∆ω)]z+ + A(|z+|2 + |z−|2)z+

+B|z+|2z+ + C ¯z+z2
−

˙z− = [λ − ∆λ + i(ω − ∆ω)]z− + A(|z+|2 + |z−|2)z−

+B|z−|2z− + C ¯z−z2
+.

(7)

(8)

Here ∆ω measures the diﬀerence in frequency between the two modes
at onset, and ∆λ measures the diﬀerence in their linear growth rates.
Under appropriate nondegeneracy conditions (which we assume here)
we may neglect all interchange symmetry-breaking contributions to
the nonlinear terms. In the following we consider the regime in which
λ, ∆λ, and ∆ω are all of the same order; in the large aspect ratio
binary ﬂuid convection context this will occur when these quantities
are all O(Γ−2) (see section 3.2). We will see that when ∆λ and/or
∆ω are nonzero, (7,8) have bursting solutions. Thus, the bursting
mechanism may be viewed as an interaction between spontaneous
symmetry breaking (in which the trivial conduction state loses sta-
bility to a convecting state with less symmetry) and forced symmetry
breaking (in which the presence of sidewalls make ∆λ and/or ∆ω
nonzero, thereby breaking the D4 symmetry). The introduction of
small symmetry-breaking terms is also responsible for the possibility

of complex dynamics in other systems that would otherwise behave
in a regular manner (Dangelmayr & Knobloch [91, 85], Lauterbach
& Roberts [92], Knobloch [93], Hirschberg & Knobloch [94]).

To identify the bursts we introduce the change of variables

= cos θ(BI − CI cos 2φ) − CR sin 2φ + 2∆ω ρ,

(10)

(11)

where A = AR + iAI , etc. There is also a decoupled equation
for ψ(t) so that ﬁxed points and periodic solutions of equations (9-
11) correspond, respectively, to periodic solutions and two-tori in
equations (7,8).

In the following we measure the amplitude of the disturbance by
r ≡ |z+|2 + |z−|2 = ρ−1; thus ρ = 0 corresponds to inﬁnite amplitude
states. Equations (9-11) show that the restriction to the invariant
subspace Σ ≡ {ρ = 0} is equivalent to taking ∆λ = ∆ω = 0 in
(10,11). The resulting D4-symmetric problem has three generic types
of ﬁxed points (Swift [95]):

• u solutions with cos θ = 0, cos 2φ = 1
• v solutions with cos θ = 0, cos 2φ = −1
• w solutions with sin θ = 0.

In the binary ﬂuid context the u, v and w solutions represent mixed
parity traveling wave states localized near one of the container walls,
mixed parity chevron (or counterpropagating) states, and pure even

where γ = 0.15 + 0.025i, L = 80 and − L
2 . Depending on
the coeﬃcients A, B and C the subspace Σ may contain additional
ﬁxed points and/or limit cycles (Swift [95]). In our scenario, a burst
occurs for λ > 0 when a trajectory follows the stable manifold of
a ﬁxed point (or a limit cycle) P1 ∈ Σ that is unstable within Σ.
The instability within Σ then kicks the trajectory towards another
ﬁxed point (or limit cycle) P2 ∈ Σ. If this point has an unstable ρ
eigenvalue the trajectory escapes from Σ towards a ﬁnite amplitude
(ρ > 0) state, forming a burst. If ∆λ and/or ∆ω 6= 0 this state may
itself be unstable to perturbations of type P1 and the process then

repeats. This bursting behavior is thus associated with a codimension
one heteroclinic cycle between the inﬁnite amplitude solutions P1 and
P2 (Moehlis & Knobloch [2], Knobloch & Moehlis [3]). Examples of
such cycles are shown in ﬁgure 6. Since in such cycles the trajectory
reaches inﬁnity in ﬁnite time the heteroclinic cycle actually describes
bursts of ﬁnite duration (Moehlis & Knobloch [2]).

For such a heteroclinic cycle to form it is required that at least
one of the branches in the D4-symmetric system be subcritical (P1)
and one supercritical (P2). Based on the 3He/4He experiments, we
focus on parameter values for which the u solutions are subcritical
and the v, w solutions supercritical when ∆λ = ∆ω = 0 (Moehlis &
Knobloch [1]). When ∆λ and/or ∆ω 6= 0, two types of oscillations in
(θ, φ) are possible:

• rotations (see ﬁgure 7)
• librations (see ﬁgure 8).

For λ > 0 these give rise, under appropriate conditions, to sequences
of large amplitude bursts arising from repeated excursions towards
the inﬁnite amplitude (ρ = 0) u solutions. Irregular bursts are also
readily generated: ﬁgure 9 shows bursts arising from chaotic rota-
tions. Figure 10 provides a partial summary of the diﬀerent solutions
of (9-11) and their stability properties; much of the complexity re-
vealed in these ﬁgures is due to the Shil’nikov-like properties of the
heteroclinic cycle (Moehlis & Knobloch [2], Knobloch & Moehlis [3]).
We now focus on the physical manifestation of the bursts.
In
ﬁgure 11 we show the solutions of ﬁgures 7 and 8 in the form of space-
time plots using the approximate eigenfunctions (12). The bursts in
ﬁgure 11(a) are generated as a result of successive visits to diﬀerent
(but symmetry-related) inﬁnite amplitude u solutions, cf. ﬁgure 7; in
ﬁgure 11(b) the generating trajectory makes repeated visits to the
same inﬁnite amplitude u solution, cf. ﬁgure 8. The former state
is typical of the blinking state identiﬁed in binary ﬂuid and doubly
diﬀusive convection in rectangular containers (Kolodner et al. [96],
Steinberg et al. [97], Predtechensky et al. [98]). It is likely that the
irregular bursts reported in Sullivan & Ahlers [4] are due to such a
state. The latter is a new state which we call a winking state; winking

states may be stable but often coexist with stable chevron-like states
which are more likely to be observed in experiments in which the
Rayleigh number is ramped upwards (cf. ﬁgure 10). For other values
of ∆λ and ∆ω it is also possible to ﬁnd stable chaotic winking states
and states which are neither purely blinking nor purely winking (see
ﬁgure 12).

The bursts described above are the result of oscillations in ampli-
tude between two modes of opposite parity and “frozen” spatial struc-
ture. Consequently the above burst mechanism applies in systems in
which bursts occur very close to threshold. This occurs not only in
the convection experiments already mentioned but also in the math-
ematically identical (counterrotating) Taylor-Couette system where
counterpropagating spiral vortices play the same role as traveling
waves in convection (Andereck et al. [99], Pierce & Knobloch [100]).
In slender systems, such as the convection system described above or
a long Taylor-Couette apparatus, a large aspect ratio Γ is required for
the presence of the approximate D4 symmetry. If the size of the D4
symmetry-breaking terms ∆λ, ∆ω is increased too much the bursts
fade away and are replaced by smaller amplitude, higher frequency
states (see ﬁgure 13). Indeed, if ∆ω ≫ ∆λ, averaging eliminates the
C terms responsible for the bursts (Landsberg & Knobloch [5]). From

these considerations, we conclude that bursts will not be present if Γ
is too small or ǫ too large. However, the mechanism is quite robust
and even for ∆ω ≫ ∆λ it may still be possible to choose λ values so
that bursts of large dynamic range occur (Moehlis & Knobloch [2]).
It is possible that the burst amplitude can become large enough
for secondary instabilities not captured by the Ansatz (1) to be trig-
gered. Such instabilities could occur on very diﬀerent scales and
result in turbulent rather than just large amplitude bursts. However,
it should be emphasized that the physical amplitude of the bursts

In particular, as shown in Moehlis & Knobloch [2], the mechanism is
robust with respect to the addition of small ﬁfth order terms. How-
ever, the eﬀects of including D4-symmetry-breaking terms in the cu-
bic terms in (7,8) have not been analyzed; these terms can dominate
the symmetry-breaking terms retained in the linear terms when ρ is
small.

3.2 Applicability to binary mixtures

In view of the motivation for studying systems with approximate
D4 symmetry described above, it is of interest to examine carefully
the properties of the linear stability problem for binary ﬂuid con-
vection in ﬁnite containers.
In the Boussinesq approximation this
system is described by the nondimensionalized equations (Clune &
Knobloch [101])

∂tu + (u · ∇)u = −∇P + σR[θ(1 + S) − Sη]ˆz + σ∇2u, (13)
∂tθ + (u · ∇)θ = w + ∇2θ,
(14)
∂tη + (u · ∇)η = τ ∇2η + ∇2θ,

(15)

together with the incompressibility condition

∇ · u = 0.

(16)

Here u ≡ (u, w) is the velocity ﬁeld in (x, z) coordinates, P , θ and C
denote the departures of the pressure, temperature and concentration
ﬁelds from their conduction proﬁles, and η ≡ θ − C. These equations
are to be solved in the rectangular domain D ≡ {x, z| − 1
2 Γ ≤ x ≤
2 Γ, − 1
1

2 ≤ z ≤ 1

2 }.

The system is speciﬁed by four dimensionless parameters in ad-
dition to the aspect ratio Γ: the separation ratio S, the Prandtl and
Lewis numbers σ, τ , and the Rayleigh number R. The boundary con-
ditions appropriate to the experiments are no-slip everywhere, with
the temperature ﬁxed at the top and bottom and no sideways heat
ﬂux. The ﬁnal set of boundary conditions is provided by the require-
ment that there is no mass ﬂux through any of the boundaries. The

u = n · ∇η = 0 on ∂D,

θ = 0 at z = ±1/2,

∂xθ = 0 at x = ±Γ.

Here ∂D denotes the boundary of D.

Figure 15 shows the results of solving the linear problem describ-
ing the stability properties of the conduction state u = θ = η = 0
for parameter values used by Sullivan & Ahlers [4] in their 3He/4He
experiment: σ = 0.6, τ = 0.03, Γ = 34.0. The ﬁgure shows the neu-
tral stability curves and corresponding frequencies for the ﬁrst four
modes in the range 33.0 ≤ Γ ≤ 35.0 for S = −0.001 and S = −0.021.
Observe that when |S| is suﬃciently small the ﬁrst two families of
neutral curves are separated by a gap that is much larger than the
amplitude of the “braids” within each family (ﬁgure 15(a)). This
is typical of what happens in Rayleigh-B´enard convection with non-
Neumann boundary conditions (Hirschberg & Knobloch [102]) and
makes it easy to justify projecting the ﬂuid equations onto the ﬁrst
two modes that become unstable. However, the situation is not so
simple. This is because in the case of overstability this behavior does
not persist for all Γ or all values of |S|. For larger values of these
parameters the results take instead the form shown in ﬁgures 15(c,d)
which show the linear stability results for S = −0.021 and the same
range of values of Γ as ﬁgures 15(a,b). The modes from the diﬀerent

families now cross and the ﬁrst unstable mode belongs to successively
higher and higher families when extrapolated to small |S| (Batiste et
al. [87]). Figure 15(c) shows the crossing of two even modes involving
a nonresonant double Hopf bifurcation (ﬁgure 15(d)). As discussed
in detail in Batiste et al. [87] the transition between these two types
of behavior is mediated by a resonant 1:1 mode crossing at a some-
what smaller value of |S|. The experimental value of the separation
ratio from Sullivan & Ahlers [4], S = −0.021, therefore corresponds
to the “crossing” case and the projection of the equations onto two
modes cannot be rigorously justiﬁed except in the neighborhood of
mode crossing points.

We denote the growth rates and frequencies of the modes z±
by λ± and ω±. For large aspect ratios, the mode frequencies must
go like ω± ∼ ω∞ + c1±Γ−1 + c2±Γ−2 + · · ·. The fact that the fre-
quency curves in ﬁgure 15(d) are essentially parallel “straight lines”
implies that c1+ ≈ c1−. Therefore, ∆ω ≡ (ω+ − ω−)/2 = O(Γ−2)
for large Γ (Batiste et al. [87]). Moreover, as argued in Landsberg &
Knobloch [5], the parabolic minimum of the neutral stability curve
leads to the expectation that ∆λ = O(Γ−2). Thus, in the range
λ = O(Γ−2), λ, ∆λ, and ∆ω are all of the same order as Γ → ∞,
as required for the applicability of equations (7, 8). Of course, close
enough to the mode crossing point ∆λ ≪ ∆ω, and in this region
averaging methods can be used to eliminate the (¯z+z2
+) terms
from the mode interaction equations (Landsberg & Knobloch [5]).
However, for typical values of ∆λ it appears likely that the system is
correctly described by equations (7, 8), as hypothesized in Landsberg
& Knobloch [5] and Moehlis & Knobloch [1].

−, ¯z−z2

The ﬁrst odd and even temperature eigenfunctions for S = −0.021
are shown in ﬁgure 16 in the form of a space-time diagram, with time
increasing upward. As in the approximate expression (12) the eigen-
function consists of waves propagating outwards from the center of
the container. The eigenfunction amplitude has a local minimum at
the center and increases outwards, peaking near the sidewalls. This
type of eigenfunction was anticipated by Cross [103] and is charac-
teristic of eigenfunctions in systems with positive group velocity (al-

even mode temperature

odd mode temperature

σ = 0.6, τ = 0.03, Γ = 34.0 and S = −0.021 in the form of a

though, strictly speaking, in a ﬁnite system one cannot deﬁne a group
velocity since the allowed wave number is quantized by the sidewalls
as well as being nonuniform). However, for the present purposes the
most important observation is that for aspect ratios as large as this,
the odd and even eigenfunctions are essentially indistinguishable, as
hypothesized by Landsberg & Knobloch [5].

3.3 Other systems with approximate D4 symmetry

There are a number of other systems of interest where an approximate
D4 symmetry arises in a natural way and the bursting mechanism
described in section 3.1 may be relevant. These include overstable
convection in small aspect ratio containers with nearly square cross-
section (Armbruster [104, 105]) and more generally any partial diﬀer-
ential equation on a nearly square domain describing the evolution of
an oscillatory instability, cf. Ashwin & Mei [106]. Other systems in
which our bursting mechanism might be detected are electrohydro-
dynamic convection in liquid crystals (Silber et al. [107]; T. Peacock,
private communication), lasers (Feng et al. [108]), spring-supported
ﬂuid-conveying tubes (Steindl & Troger [109]), and dynamo theories
of magnetic ﬁeld generation in the Sun (Knobloch & Landsberg [110],
Knobloch et al. [111]).

Perhaps more interesting is the possibility that large scale spa-
tial modulation due to distant walls may produce bursting in a fully
nonlinear state with D4 symmetry undergoing a symmetry-breaking
Hopf bifurcation. As an example we envisage a steady pattern of fully
nonlinear two-dimensional rolls. With periodic boundary conditions
with period four times the basic roll period, the roll pattern has D4
symmetry since the pattern is preserved under spatial translations
If such a pattern undergoes a sec-
by 1/4 period and a reﬂection.
ondary Hopf bifurcation with a spatial Floquet multiplier exp iπ/2,
the Hopf bifurcation breaks D4 symmetry. If the invariance of the
basic pattern under translations by 1/4 period is only approximate
(this would be the case if the roll amplitude varied on a slow spatial
scale), the D4 symmetry itself would be weakly broken and the new
mechanism described above could operate.

Also of interest is the Faraday system in a nearly square con-
tainer. In this system gravity-capillary waves are excited on the sur-
face of a viscous ﬂuid by vertical vibration of the container, usually as
a result of a subharmonic resonance. Simonelli & Gollub [112] stud-
ied the eﬀect of changing the shape of the container from a square to
a slightly rectangular container, focusing on the (3, 2), (2, 3) interac-
tion in this system. These modes are degenerate in a square container
and only pure and mixed modes were found in this case. In a slightly
rectangular container the degeneracy between these modes is broken,
however, and in this case a region of quasiperiodic and chaotic be-
havior was present near onset. When these oscillations ﬁrst appear
they take the form of relaxation oscillations in which the surface of
the ﬂuid remains ﬂat for a long time before a “large wave grows,
reaches a maximum, and decays, all in a time short compared with
the period”. The duration of the spikes is practically independent of
the forcing amplitude, while the interspike period appears to diverge
as the forcing amplitude decreases. The spikes themselves possess
the characteristic asymmetry seen in ﬁgures 7 and 8. This behavior
occurs when the forcing frequency lies below the resonance frequency
of the square container, i.e., precisely when D4-symmetric problem
has a subcritical branch. Irregular bursts are also found, depending
on parameters, but these are distinct from the chaotic states found
by Nagata [113] far from threshold and present even in a square con-
tainer.

4 Discussion

In this article we have seen that there are many diﬀerent mechanisms
responsible for bursting in hydrodynamical systems. The table below
summarizes the diﬀerent mechanisms described in terms of properties
that are most relevant to hydrodynamics. Thus no single mechanism
can be expected to provide a universal explanation for all observa-
tions. The bursts found experimentally in Taylor-Couette ﬂow (cf.
section 2.5) and large aspect ratio binary ﬂuid convection (cf. sec-
tion 3.1) occur very close to the threshold of a primary instability and

thus have the greatest potential for a successful dynamical systems
interpretation of the type emphasized here. We have seen, however,
that even for fully developed turbulent boundary layers at very large
Reynolds numbers a dynamical systems approach can be proﬁtable
(cf. section 2.1).

Although nearly all of the mechanisms we have described rely
on the presence of global bifurcations, there are important diﬀer-
ences among them. For example, the bursts in the wall region of a
turbulent boundary layer described in section 2.1 are due to a (struc-
turally stable) heteroclinic cycle connecting ﬁxed points with ﬁnite
amplitude; such a cycle leads to bursts with a limited dynamic range.
In contrast, in the mechanism of section 3.1 the dynamic range is un-
limited. Moreover, the role of the ﬁxed points is diﬀerent: in the for-
mer the bursts are associated with the excursions between the ﬁxed
points while in the latter the bursts are associated with the ﬁxed
points. Because of the asymptotic stability of the cycle the time be-
tween successive bursts in the turbulent boundary layer will increase
without bound unless the stochastic pressure term is included; such
a stochastic term is not required in the mechanism of section 3.1.
In particular, in this mechanism the duration of the bursts remains
ﬁnite despite the fact that they are associated with a heteroclinic
connection. This is because of the faster than exponential escape
to “inﬁnity” that is typical of this mechanism. This is so also for
the mechanism described in section 2.3. Both of these mechanisms
involve global connections to inﬁnity and hence are capable of de-
scribing bursts of arbitrarily large dynamic range. The models of the
subcritical transition to turbulence and various types of intermittency
also produce bursts of ﬁnite duration but rely on global reinjection
which produces bursts of bounded amplitude.

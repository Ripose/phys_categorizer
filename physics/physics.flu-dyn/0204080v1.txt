Towards a suﬃcient criterion for collapse in 3D Euler
equations

Abstract

A suﬃcient integral criterion for a blow-up solution of the Hopf equations (the
Euler equations with zero pressure) is found. This criterion shows that a certain
positive integral quantity blows up in a ﬁnite time under speciﬁc initial conditions.
Blow-up of this quantity means that solution of the Hopf equation in 3D can not
be continued in the Sobolev space H 2(R3) for inﬁnite time.

1 Introduction

In 1984 Beale, Kato and Maida [1] showed that suﬃcient and necessary condition for a
smooth solution to the 3D Euler equations for ideal incompressible ﬂuids on the time
interval [0, t0] is the ﬁniteness of the integral,

supr|ω| dt < ∞.

(1)

Here ω is the vorticity, connected with the velocity ﬁeld v by the standard relation:

t0

Z0

ω = curl v.

If the integral (1) is divergent, then the vorticity blows up (or collapses) in a ﬁnite time.
Proof of this criterion is based on the local existence theorem [2]. According to this
theorem a smooth solution to the 3D incompressible Euler equations exists if the initial
conditions v(0) belong to the Sobolev space H q(R3) for q ≥ 3 and the solution itself is
from the class,

v ∈ C([0, t0]; H q) ∩ C 1([0, t0]; H q−1),

where the norm of H q is deﬁned as follows,

kvkH q(R3) =

with α being a multi-index. In accordance with [1], the violation of this property leads
to divergence of the integral (1) and to collapse for vorticity.

However, in order to use the criterion (1), eﬀectively one needs to have an explicit
solution to the Euler equation, that is practically very diﬃcult or impossible. Therefore,
the main task is to ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions which guarantee blow-up of the vorticity.

The ﬁrst step in this direction would be to construct such criteria for models more simple
than the incompressible Euler equations which is one of the main aims of this paper.

We consider the simplest variant – the Euler equations for a compressible ﬂuid without

pressure (the hydrodynamics of dust) which are sometimes called the Hopf equations:

∂ρ
∂t

∂v
∂t

+ div ρv = 0,

+ (v · ∇)v = 0.

These equations can be successfully solved by means of the Lagrangian description. In
terms of Lagrangian variables the equation (4) describes the motion of free ﬂuid particles.
For this reason breaking is possible in this model: it happens when trajectories of ﬂuid
particles intersect.
In terms of the mapping, describing the change of variables from
the Eulerian description to the Lagrangian one, the process of breaking corresponds to a
vanishing Jacobian, J, of the mapping. This process can be considered as a collapse in
this system: the density ρ as well as the velocity gradient become inﬁnite at a ﬁnite time
in the points where the Jacobian vanishes. By virtue of this the breaking is sometimes
called gradient catastrophe.

In this paper we construct suﬃcient integral criteria for breaking within the model
(3),(4) and verify what the functional conditions of the theorem [1] correspond to those
for the given system. Our main conjecture is the following: breaking in the 3D case within
the system yields a violation of Sobolev space already for q = 2 instead of q ≥ 3 in the
theorem [1].

To complete the introduction we would like to note that the model (3), (4) has a lot
of astrophysical applications. According to the pioneering idea of Ya.B. Zeldovich [3],
the formation of proto-galaxies due to breaking of stellar dust can be described by the
system (3), (4) (see also the review [4]). It should be noticed also that recently [5, 6] the
mechanism of breaking was used to explain collapse in incompressible ﬂuids when, instead
of the breaking of ﬂuid particles, the breaking of vortex lines can happen which results in
a blow-up of vorticity. Therefore we believe that the results presented in this paper can
also be useful from the point of view of collapse in incompressible ﬂuids.

2 One-dimensional analysis

We begin with a one-dimensional calculations where Eq. (4) has the form

Consider the integrals

with integer n, where integration is assumed to be from −∞ to +∞.

It is easy to show that the evolution of these integrals is deﬁned by the relations:

vt + vvx = 0 .

which can be obtained by means of (5) and integration by parts.

The relations for n = 2, 3 read:

These diﬀerential relations allow one to ﬁnd a closed diﬀerential inequality for the
v2
x dx. Applying the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky inequality to (7) gives the

integral I2 =
estimation

R

Substituting,

into (9) we arrive at the closed diﬀerential inequality for I2:

This inequality is solved by means of change of variables

with unknown exponent α. We will deﬁne the exponent by requiring the absence in (10)
of the terms ∼ X α−2X 2
t . Hence α = −1 and the inequality becomes,

Using a mechanical interpretation of X as the coordinate of a particle and taking into
account that the particle acceleration is negative, we can immediately conclude that the
particle can reach origin X = 0 in a ﬁnite time if the initial particle velocity Xt(0) is
negative. For I2 this means a blow-up:

Hence, by elementary calculation, we can estimate the collapse time t0:

After multiplying (11) by Xt (< 0) and integrating the result over time, we arrive at the
estimation from above for I2 :

Thus, the blow-up of I2 takes place if the initial velocity Xt(0) is negative which is
equivalent to the initial condition,

If the initial distribution of v0(x) is symmetric with respect to x, then I3(0) ≡ 0. However,
as follows from (7), I3 becomes negative already at t = +0 that results in a blow-up of
the integral I2.

To complete this section, let us compare the estimate (12) with the exact time depen-

dence of I2(t) near the breaking point.

In order to deﬁne this dependence, we diﬀerentiate (5) with respect to x that results

in the equation,

where a is the initial coordinate of the ﬂuid particle at t = 0, v0(a) is the initial velocity,
the prime denotes a derivative. The denominator in (14), 1 + va(a)t, represents the
Jacobian J of the mapping,

The Jacobian tends to zero for the ﬁrst time at t = t0, deﬁned by

Near the singular point, a = a0, corresponding to the minimum, (15) J can be approxi-
mated by the expression,

J ≈ α(t0 − t) + γ(a − a0)2.

Here

As a result, vx takes a singularity as τ = t0 − t → 0:

α =

3 Multi-dimensional breaking

In this section we generalize the above analysis to multi-dimensions.

In the multi-dimensional case, instead of vx it is convenient to introduce the matrix

U with matrix elements

Our aim is now to ﬁnd the inequality corresponding to (9). Consider two scalar charac-
teristics of the matrix U: its trace, tr U ≡ div v and determinant, det U. From (18) we
derive the following equations for these two quantities:

Now we introduce the positive deﬁnite integral,

which, in the 1D case, coincides with I2. Due to (20), we have

This equation generalizes the equation (7) to the multi-dimensional case. The second
derivative of I will be given by the expression,

Now, we shall estimate the integral on the r.h.s. of this equation. We shall assume that
all eigenvalues of the matrix U are real. Such an assumption means that the matrix U is
close to its symmetric part, S = 1/2(U + U T ), the so-called stress tensor (here T denotes
In this case the antisymmetric part of the matrix U, the vorticity tensor,
transpose).
Ω = 1/2(U −U T ) 2, is small compared to S. In particular, if Ω = 0 the matrix U coincides
with S, representing the Hessian of the velocity potential Φ: Uij = Sij = ∂2Φ/∂xi∂xj.

Substitution (24) and (25) into (23) gives the desired diﬀerential inequality,

Its solution is sought in power form as before: I = xα. Excluding terms proportional to

t we ﬁnd that α = −D and

For X this results in the same inequality as (10): Xtt < 0. The criterion for attaining the
origin X = 0 will be also analogous:

For arbitrary D, instead of (11), the following estimation appears for I:

4 Comparison with exact solution

In order to compare the estimation (28) with the exact dependence of I we have to solve
equation (18). This solution is

Here a is the initial coordinates of a ﬂuid particle and U0(a) is the initial value of the matrix
U. By introducing the projectors P (k) of the matrix U0(a) (P (k)2 = P (k) corresponding to

each of the eigenvalues λ0k(a)), this expression can be rewritten in the form of a spectral
expansion:

The projector P (k), being a matrix function of a, is expressed through the eigenvectors
for the direct (U0(a)ψ = λ0ψ) and conjugated (φU0(a) = φλ0) spectral problems for the
matrix U0(a):

where the vectors ψ(n) and φ(m) with diﬀerent n and m are mutually orthogonal:

Hence, the determinant of the matrix U is deﬁned by the product,

the condition [4, 7]:

is a positive deﬁnite matrix.

The remarkable formula (32) demonstrates that i) the matrix U tends to the degenerate
one as t → t0 and ii) both parts of the matrix U in this limit, i.e. the stress tensor S and
the vorticity tensor Ω, become simultaneously inﬁnite (compare with [8]). It is interesting
to note that at near singular time the ratio between both parts is ﬁxed and governs by
two relations following from the deﬁnition of the projector P :

PS = P 2

S + P 2

A, PA = PSPA + PAPS

where PS and PA are respectively symmetric (”potential”) and antisymmetric (vortical)
parts of the projector P . In particular, the second relation provides the collapsing solution
for the equation for vorticity

It is also
which has the same form for both compressible and incompressible cases.
interesting to note that in the sense of the criterion (1), the collapsing solution (32)
represents the marginal solution.

The asymptotic solution (32), far from the collapsing point should be matched with a
”regular” solution. The corresponding matching scale can be estimated as l0 ≈ γ2/3. This
scale l0 alone can be taken as the size of the collapsing region for (32). This remark now
allows one to calculate the contribution from the breaking area to the integral I.

Substituting (29) into I and using a change of variables, from r to a, one can get the

expression for this contribution,

The integral is taken over the spherical volume V with coordinate center at a = a0 and
size ∼ l0. Introducing a self-similar variable ξ = aτ −1/2, one can see that the contribution
depends signiﬁcantly on the dimension D. At D = 1 this integral behaves like τ −1/2 in
full correspondence with (17). In this case, the integral over ξ is convergent at large ξ
and is not sensitive to the cut-oﬀ size l0. In the two-dimensional geometry, however, the
integral (33) has a power dependence on τ , but a logarithmic dependence on l0 arising
from integration on ξ:

that satisﬁes the inequality (28).

In the three-dimensional case, the integral (33) diverges at large scales as the ﬁrst

power of ξ, becomes proportional to the size of collapsing area l0 as τ → 0:

I ∼ log

l0
τ 1/2

I ∼ l0.

This result for D = 3 formally contradicts to the blow-up suﬃcient condition found above.
This contradiction indicates only that in the three-dimensional case the blow-up of the
integral I has no universal behavior near the singular time which should be expected
following to the universal asymptotics (32).

5 Concluding remarks

Thus, the initial condition,

dI
dt

(0) > 0,

represents a suﬃcient integral criterion for the collapse if the vorticity matrix U is small
(det U)2dr
in comparison to the stress tensor. Under this condition, the integral I =
becomes inﬁnite in a ﬁnite time.

In turn, divergence of I means that a solution can not be continued in the correspond-
ing functional space. In the 1D case this is the Sobolev space H 1(R). For D = 2, from
the inequality,

R

I ≤

|U|4d2r (|U|2 ≡ U 2

ik),

Z

together with the embedding Sobolev inequality,

1/4

|U|4d2r

 Z

≤ CkUkH 1(R2)

it follows that kUkH 1(R2) → ∞ as I → ∞. In terms of the velocity, this means that the
solution is not continued in the Sobolev space H 2(R2).

In the 3D case it is possible to write the following set of inequalities,

I 1/6 ≤

|U|6d3r

≤ CkUkH 1(R3),

1/6

(cid:19)
where the second inequality represents the partial case of the Sobolev embedding inequal-
ity [10].

(cid:18)Z

Hence, one can see that I → ∞ is equivalent to the divergence of the norm (2) for the
Sobolev space H 2(R3). Thus, the requirements for strong solutions in the hydrodynamic
model (3), (4) are diﬀerent from those for the 3D Euler equation for incompressible ﬂuids.
At the moment it is hard to say whether the results presented in this paper contradict
to the theorem [2] (see also [9]) or not. In any case, it is a very interesting question. It
should be added that collapse in incompressible ﬂuids might happen through breaking
of vortex lines (there are some arguments both analytical and numerical [5, 6] in a favor
of such point of view). In this case the corresponding norms would also blow up for the
same Sobolev space H 2(R3).

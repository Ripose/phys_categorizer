Pinning and depinning of drops on an inclined heterogeneous substrate is studied as a function

of the inclination and heterogeneity amplitude. Two types of heterogeneity are considered: a

hydrophobic defect that blocks the droplet in front, and a hydrophilic one that holds it at the

back. Two diﬀerent types of depinning leading to sliding motion are identiﬁed, and the resulting

stick-slip motion is studied numerically.

It is well known that liquid drops on an ideally smooth substrate move in response

to external gradients. For example, a drop on an inclined substrate slides downslope in

response to the gradient of potential energy [1, 2]. Likewise a droplet in a temperature

gradient will move towards higher temperatures as a result of Marangoni forces caused by

surface tension gradients [3]. Alternatively, a wettability gradient induced by a chemical

grading of the substrate also causes droplet motion. In order to minimize its energy the

droplet will move towards the most wettable region [4, 5]. Although on ideally smooth

substrates droplets will move even for arbitrarily small gradients, this is not the case for

the ’real’ substrates used in experiments. There the onset of contact line motion is strongly

inﬂuenced by chemical or physical heterogeneities of the substrate and a ﬁnite driving force

is necessary to overcome the pinning inﬂuence of the heterogeneities [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

On the smaller, atomic scale surface heterogeneities can trap droplets even on very smooth

surfaces.

Indeed, heterogeneities occurring on a micro- or mesoscale are known to aﬀect

the macroscopic movement of droplets and are responsible, for instance, for the observed

hysteresis between advancing and receding contact angles [13, 14, 15].

The simplest example of depinning is described by the Adler equation [16]

˙θ = µ − sin θ,

(1)

where θ represents the position of the droplet, and µ > 0 represents the applied force. When

µ < 1 this equation has a pair of ﬁxed points, one of which is stable and the other unstable.

At µ = 1 these ﬁxed points annihilate in a saddle-node bifurcation, but unlike the standard

saddle-node bifurcation this bifurcation produces periodic motion for µ > 1. This result is
simplest to understand if we write Eq. (1) as ˙θ = −dV /dθ, V ≡ −µθ − cos θ. Evidently,

Eq. (1) represents an overdamped particle in a cosinusoidal potential that is progressively

tilted as µ increases. A ’particle’ in a stable equilibrium at a local minimum of this potential

’spills out’ once the tilt becomes large enough that its position no longer corresponds to a

minimum. This occurs precisely at µ = 1. The periodic motion present for µ > 1 corresponds

to the particle sliding down the resulting ’washboard’ potential. The period of this motion
diverges as (µ − 1)−1/2 [17]. The resulting bifurcation is sometimes called a Saddle-Node

Inﬁnite PERiod bifurcation or ’sniper’ for short.

In this paper we explore the process of pinning and depinning of driven droplets on a

heterogeneous substrate. For simplicity we consider the case of gravitational forcing on

an inclined substrate with a heterogeneous disjoining potential with a well-deﬁned spatial

period such as might arise from spatially varying wetting properties resulting from chem-

ical heterogeneity. This formulation avoids complications arising from changes in surface

elevation of the substrate (surface roughness) while retaining the essence of the pinning phe-

nomenon. In addition we focus on nanoscale droplets for which we can solve the governing

equation for both the droplet proﬁle and the precursor ﬁlm, without involving the matched

asymptotic expansions required for larger droplets. We avoid energy methods since these

do not permit us to study time-dependent phenomena.

A two-dimensional liquid droplet on an inhomogeneous solid substrate subject to a hor-

izontal force µ (Fig.1) is described by an evolution equation for the ﬁlm thickness proﬁle

h(x, t) derived from the Navier-Stokes equation using the long-wave approximation [18]:

∂t h = −∂x (cid:26)

h3
3η

[∂x (γ∂xxh + Π(h, x)) + µ]

.

(cid:27)

(2)

Here γ is the surface tension, η is the dynamic viscosity, while Π(h, x) is the disjoining

pressure that accounts for the wetting properties of the heterogeneous substrate [19]. We
0/h3 + (Sp(x)/l) exp[(d0 − h)/l] [20, 21], where Sa and Sp are the
use the form Π(h, x) = 2Sad2

apolar and polar components of the total spreading coeﬃcient S = Sa + Sp, d0 = 0.158 nm

is the Born repulsion length and l is a correlation length [20], and choose Sa > 0 and

Sp < 0, thereby combining a stabilizing long-range van der Waals liquid-solid interaction

with a destabilizing short-range polar interaction. The latter contains the inﬂuence of surface

coating and wettability defects, and crucially inﬂuences the static contact angle [20]. When

µ = 0 the resulting model describes static droplets with a ﬁnite mesoscopic equilibrium

contact angle sitting on an ultrathin precursor ﬁlm. However, any qualitatively similar

disjoining pressure yields like results, as shown for dewetting in [21] and for chemically

driven running droplets in [22].

We nondimensionalize Eq. (2) using the scales 3ηγ/κ2l for time, l for the ﬁlm thickness

and
the dimensionless quantities b = (2Sad2

lγ/κ for the lateral coordinate, where κ = (|Sp|/l) exp(d0/l). In addition we deﬁne
0/|Sp|l2) exp(−d0/l) and α = (γl/κ3)1/2(µ/ρ). Thus

p

for gravitational forcing α measures the inclination of the substrate, and we refer to it as

the inclination. The loading of the system (relevant for gravitational forcing) is measured
by the mean ﬁlm height ¯h ≡ L−1

Figures 2(a,b) show sample steady state proﬁles for two cases: (a) a hydrophilic defect,

h3 − [1 + ǫξ(x)] e−h,

ξ(x) = {2 cn[2K(k)x/L, k]}2 − ∆,

(3)

(4)

where K(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind and ∆ is such that the average

of ξ(x) over a spatial period vanishes. We use the logarithmic measure s ≡ − log(1 − k)

to quantify the steepness of the heterogeneity proﬁles (Fig. 2(a,b)). These correspond to

hydrophilic (ǫ < 0) or hydrophobic (ǫ > 0) defects. In (a) the droplet is held at the back by a

hydrophilic defect and develops a prominent shoulder as α increases just prior to depinning.

In contrast in (b) the hydrophobic defect blocks the droplet and its proﬁle steepens with

increasing α. The proﬁles at depinning are shaded. Figures 2(c,d) show the advancing and

receding mesoscopic contact angles, measured at the inﬂection points of the drop proﬁle, as

a function of α. For a droplet pinned at the back (Fig. 2(c)) the advancing [receding] angle

decreases [increases] for small but increasing inclination α. However, once the droplet starts

developing a shoulder at the back the receding angle decreases again until depinning occurs.

The situation diﬀers for a droplet pinned at the front (Fig. 2(d)). In this case both angles

increase with α but drop just prior to depinning (Fig. 2).

The depinning process corresponds to the loss of stability of the pinned drop. The

stability calculation [23] reveals two mechanisms that lead to depinning. The ﬁrst is via

a sniper bifurcation (i.e., a steady state bifurcation) and prevails for hydrophobic defects

with small wettability contrast [23] and for hydrophilic defects. Figure 3(a) shows a typical

bifurcation diagram for the latter case as a function of increasing α. The ﬁgure shows the
L2 norm of δh ≡ h(x) − ¯h for pinned drops and its time-average after depinning. Although

there are two saddle-node bifurcations in the diagram time integration (open circles) shows

that the upper part of the branch of pinned drops is stable until the rightmost saddle-node

bifurcation. Thereafter the solutions are time-dependent but periodic (open triangles). The
inset shows that near the saddle-node the period diverges like (α − αc)−1/2 and hence that

in this case depinning corresponds to a sniper bifurcation. Figures 3(b,c) show space-time

plots of the resulting motion for (b) α & αc, and (c) α = 0.04. In (b) the drop spends a

long time in a nearly stationary state while slowly spreading downstream, before it abruptly

breaks oﬀ and moves towards the next defect. In contrast in (c) the drop ﬂows more or

less at constant speed downslope, although the location of the defect remains visible in the

space-time plot.

Figure 4(a) shows the location of the two saddle-nodes in the (ǫ, α) plane. In the case

of a hydrophilic defect (ǫ < 0) the saddle-nodes are always present; the one at larger α
corresponds to the depinning bifurcation. For ﬁxed ¯h and large L the critical α decreases as

1/L (not shown), as expected on the basis of simple loading ideas. However, the ﬁgure also

shows that something else happens for suﬃciently hydrophobic defects. Here the saddle-

nodes annihilate at ǫ ≈ 0.6, and depinning now occurs via a Hopf bifurcation (dashed line).

The resulting bifurcation diagram (Fig. 5(a)) shows that the range of stable pinned proﬁles

overlaps with the range of periodic states generated by the instability. Thus in this case

the branch of periodic solutions loses stability at a saddle-node bifurcation as α decreases,

and the system settles into a steady pinned state in a hysteretic transition. Figures 5(b,c)

show space-time plots of the periodic state near this transition and further away. Here the

depinning is as abrupt as in Fig. 3(b) but without the slow downstream leakage seen in the

latter ﬁgure. The resulting dynamics strongly resemble stick-slip motion. However, further

away from the transition the depinned states in both cases look quite alike: in both cases

the droplet travels at almost constant speed, only slightly modulated by the heterogeneity.

The advancing and receding angles at depinning (shaded proﬁles in Fig. 2) shown in

Fig. 4(b) provide a measure of the contact angle hysteresis observed macroscopically. In the

case of a hydrophobic defect at the front (ǫ > 0) both angles increase nearly linearly with

defect strength, and continue to do so even for oscillatory depinning (ǫ & 0.6); the small

hook visible in the ﬁgure near this transition indicates that the Hopf bifurcation sets in

prior to the disappearance of the saddle-node bifurcations. The behavior is more intricate

when the pinning is by a hydrophilic defect at the back (ǫ < 0). In this case the role of the

two angles is reversed, and both decrease nearly linearly with slopes identical to those in

the ǫ > 0 case. For ǫ < −0.2, however, the receding angle reverses tendency and starts to

increase again, while the advancing angle continues to decrease. This change in behavior is a

consequence of the stretching of the drop with increasing inclination just prior to depinning:

for ǫ . −0.2 gravity drags the main body of liquid downstream (to the right) but the spot

of higher wettability traps part of it upstream. For ﬁxed α the latter eﬀect becomes more

pronounced as |ǫ| increases, cf. Fig. 4(b).

We have examined two types of pinning: pinning by a hydrophilic defect at the back of the

droplet, and pinning by a hydrophobic defect in front of it, and identiﬁed two mechanisms

whereby pinning takes place. In the case of a suﬃciently large hydrophilic defect the droplet

stretches markedly just prior to depinning as the substrate inclination increases; the inclined

droplet loses stability at a saddle-node bifurcation, resulting in periodic motion as the droplet

slides over a periodic array of hydrophilic defects. We have referred to this type of bifurcation

as the ’sniper’. The periodic motion that results is slow when the droplet is stretching, and

fast once the droplet breaks away from a defect and spills onto the next one. The situation

is richer for hydrophobic defects that pin the droplet by blocking it. In this case in addition

to the steady state sniper bifurcation a new depinning mechanism was observed: the droplet

loses stability to an oscillatory mode prior to depinning. A mode of this type cannot be

identiﬁed by standard energy arguments. In the example shown this bifurcation is hysteretic.

The two depinning scenarios are distinguished primarily by the average speed of the droplet
near the depinning transition. In the sniper scenario this speed vanishes as (α − αc)1/2; in

the latter it is ﬁnite. At larger values of α both scenarios lead to broadly similar dynamics:

more-or-less uniform sliding motion modulated by passage over defects. It is noteworthy

that no Hopf bifurcation occurs when the wettability proﬁle is sinusoidal [23].

Many depinning phenomena in physics may be understood using the sniper scenario. Usu-

ally this is so in systems with a continuous symmetry such as invariance under translations.

In the absence of a heterogeneity spatially periodic structures may undergo a spontaneous

parity-breaking bifurcation that breaks the left-right symmetry of the pattern and produces

a drift. The direction of the drift is then determined by the associated tilt of the structure

[24]. In this case the drift speed of the structure vanishes as the square root of the distance

from the parity-breaking bifurcation. However, in the presence of spatial heterogeneities the

situation changes dramatically because near the bifurcation even small amplitude hetero-

geneities suﬃce to pin the tilted structure. A detailed study of this regime [25] shows that

while some depinning events are indeed analogous to the behavior described by the Adler

equation, a quite diﬀerent depinning mechanism is present as well. Here the tilted state

ﬁrst undergoes a Hopf bifurcation that produces back-and-forth rocking motion of the tilted

structure, but no net translation. As a parameter increases the amplitude of this oscillation

increases leading to a global bifurcation involving an unstable ﬁxed point and its translate

by one period. This bifurcation generates oscillations with a nonzero mean drift, and this

net drift increases with further increase in the parameter. The present system diﬀers in the

absence of left-right symmetry, but a global bifurcation that changes the topology of the

limit cycle produced in the Hopf bifurcation from a libration to a rotation must still take

place. Such a bifurcation can occur if the Hopf bifurcation is in fact supercritical. Consis-

tency with the Fig. 5(a) requires that the branch of periodic states must go through a pair

of saddle-node bifurcations to produce stable states of the type shown in Fig. 5(b).

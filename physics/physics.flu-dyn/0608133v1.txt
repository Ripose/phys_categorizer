Abstract

The system of hydrodynamic-type equations is derived from Alexeev’s general-
ized Boltzmann kinetic equation by two-side distribution function for a stratiﬁed
gas in gravity ﬁeld. It is applied to a problem of ultrasound propagation and at-
tenuation. The linearized version of the obtained system is studied and compared
with the Navier-Stokes one at arbitrary Knudsen numbers. The problem of a gen-
eration by a moving plane in a rareﬁed gas is explored and used as a test while
compared with experiment. It is good agreement between predicted propagation
speed, attenuation factor and experimental results for a wide range of Knudsen
numbers

Introduction

Fluid mechanics equations in its’ most popular form (Euler, Navier-Stokes, Fourier-
Kirchhoﬀ,Burnett, etc) appear in methods based on Boltzmann kinetic equation by means
of expansion in Knudsen number(Kn). The ﬁrst important version of such theory was
made by Hilbert.
It implies analiticity in Kn of both distribution function as well as
momenta functions. Further development of the theory by Chapman-Enskog and Grad
[1] weaken analiticity condition of the momenta on Kn. It allowed to deride NS, Burnett
equations for the Chapman-Enskog method and 13 momenta Grad equations widely used
in ﬂuid dynamics description. Failures in deep Knudsen regime penetration recovered
by direct attempts with many-moment theories lead to more deep understanding of the

1

problem [2, 3, 4]. The Knudsen independent expansion of the basic (Boltzmann) equa-
tion was used, namely one of Gross-Jackson, starting from the celebrating BGK model.
The uniﬁcation of Chapman-Enskog and Gross-Jackson approaches[5] exploits an idea of
nonsingular perturbation method in its Frechet expansion form [6].

One of important veriﬁcation of ﬂuid dynamics system relates to the problem of sound
propagation. Its simplest version considers the plane harmonic wave with the correspon-
dent dispersion relation. Such case obtained by linearization of the basic system repro-
duces the known experiments of [7] rather well.
It incorporated in a direct scheme of
kinetic approach [8]. The ﬂuid mechanics systems, based on BGK [9] model of collision
integral, obtained recently in [5] and [10], give good results for velocity of sound in Kn
0.1 ÷ 10 but fail in attenuation description [11].

Developing the method based on Gross-Jackson collision integral for a non-isotropic
ﬂuid for a problem, which speciﬁes [12] a direction in it we use an idea of von Karman
to divide the phase speed with respect of particle velocity direction along/against the
direction axis [13]. Such situation takes place if a gas is stratiﬁed in gravity ﬁeld, that
yields appearance of interne gravity waves branch with the obvious necessity to account
wide range of Kn [14].

Struchtrup [15] regularizes 13-moment Grad equations doing the same thing as a
test. His linearization results in a dispersion relation, which acoustic branch gives an
attenuation coeﬃcient that also does not ﬁt experiments.

Our article is devoted to this problem; we tried to improve the results on a way of
next Gross-Jackson model [16], the tendency was good but the changes were not enough.
Considering an alternative possibility to compensate the discrepancy in relaxation timees-
timation, we adress to the Alexeev generalization of Boltzmann equation [17].

Alexeev-Boltzmann equation looks like:

where D

J B is the collision Boltzmann integral.

We apply our method for the generalized Boltzmann equation of Alexeev and such
”joint” theory gives a better agreement with the experimental data [7] for attenuation at
arbitrary Knudsen number.

equilibrium and at the small diﬀerence between the functional ’up’ and ’down’ parameters
produces the Navier-Stokes equations. The theory is also valid at big Kn(free molecular
regime)[18].

We restrict ourselves by the case of one-dimensional disturbances ~U = (0, 0, U), using

a set of linearly independent momenta functions:

If we now multiply the kinetic equation with the model integral of collisions in BGK

The system (7) of the equations according to the derivation scheme is valid at all Kn.
To close the description it is enough to plug the two-side distribution function into (6),
that yields for n±, U ±, T ± as function of ρ, U, T, Pzz, qz, ¯qz. We base here on an expansion
in small Mach numbers M = max|

Substitute JI into (7) gives modiﬁcation of ﬂuid dynamics equations at arbitrary

Knudsen numbers.

Let us report the results of investigation of quasi-plane waves parameters as a function
of Kn. For this purpose we proceed in a standart way:linearizing the system (7) that
impose the dispersion relation as a link between frequency and complex wave number.

In the model of hard spheres in the continual limit τ can be connected with the

dynamical viscosity η [2]

τ and ν are linked :

with the results by other authors. The Navier-Stokes prediction is qualitatively wrong
at big Knudsen number. Our results for phase speed give the good consistency with
the experiments at all Knudsen numbers. However, our results for the attenuation of
ultrasound are good (as we can see in experiment) for the number r up to order unity
and in the free molecular regime. Taking into account disadvantages of model integral of
collisions it is planed to consider kinetic equation with full integral of collisions. It will
permit to describe processes in transition regime.

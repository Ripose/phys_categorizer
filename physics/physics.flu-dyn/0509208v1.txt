Abstract. – The response of turbulent ﬂow to time-modulated forcing is studied by direct
numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. The large-scale forcing is modulated via
periodic energy input variations at frequency ω. The response is maximal for frequencies in
the range of the inverse of the large eddy turnover time, conﬁrming the mean-ﬁeld predictions
of von der Heydt, Grossmann and Lohse (Phys. Rev. E 67, 046308 (2003)). In accordance
with the theory the response maximum shows only a small dependence on the Reynolds number
and is also quite insensitive to the particular ﬂow-quantity that is monitored, e.g., kinetic energy,
dissipation-rate, or Taylor-Reynolds number. At suﬃciently high frequencies the amplitude
of the kinetic energy response decreases as 1/ω. For frequencies beyond the range of maximal
response, a signiﬁcant change in phase-shift relative to the time-modulated forcing is observed.

Introduction. – Recently, response maxima in time modulated turbulence have been
predicted within a mean ﬁeld theory of turbulence [1]. Subsequently, such response maxima
were found [2] in numerical simulations of simpliﬁed dynamical turbulence models such as
the GOY model [3–5] or the reduced wave vector approximation (REWA) [6–9]. However,
these response maxima computed in [2] were not pronounced at all, due to the approximate
treatment of the small scales in either of these approaches. Indications of response maxima
resulting from time-modulated forcing have subsequently also been seen in experiment [10].
The experimental observations were done by introducing a time-dependent swirl to ﬂuid in a
closed container and monitoring the energy-dissipation-rate. The selected set-up did not allow
to identify possible ﬂow-structuring under resonance conditions, nor to conclusively distinguish
such resonance phenomena from ﬂow-organization associated with the size of the container.

The purpose of this paper is to complement these theoretical, numerical, and experimental
observations by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence, subject to time-modulated
large-scale forcing. In a turbulent ﬂow whose large-scale forcing is periodically modulated in
time, all typical ﬂow-properties develop a complex time-dependence. However, averaging such
turbulent time-dependence, conditioned on the phase of the periodic modulation, yields a clear
and much simpler periodic pattern [2]. The dependence of the conditionally averaged response
on the frequency of the modulation may be quantiﬁed by monitoring changes in ﬂow-properties
such as total energy, dissipation-rate, or Taylor-Reynolds number. In case of a fast modulation
with a frequency ω ≫ ωL, where ωL is the inverse large eddy turnover time, only a modest
eﬀect on the ﬂow is expected, or none at all. Likewise, if ω ≪ ωL the modulation is quasi-
stationary and the ﬂow may be expected to closely resemble the corresponding unmodulated
case. In between these extremes a more pronounced response may develop, which is the subject
of this investigation.

The DNS approach allows to investigate in detail the response of turbulent ﬂow-properties
to periodic modulation of the forcing.
In particular, we present an extensive parameter-
study involving a large range of modulation frequencies for two diﬀerent Reynolds numbers,
and establish response maxima in a variety of ﬂow-properties. The response is found to be
signiﬁcantly increased at modulation frequencies on the order of the inverse of the eddy-
turnover time. Near resonance, the ‘activity’ of the turbulent ﬂow is found to be considerably
higher than in the unmodulated case. At high frequencies ω the amplitude of the modulation-
speciﬁc response of the kinetic energy is found to uniformly decrease to zero as ω−1. This type
of external control of turbulence may oﬀer new opportunities with relevance to technological
applications.

The organization of this paper is as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the computational ﬂow-
model in more detail. Subsequently, an overview of the ensemble averaging procedure and data
extraction is given. Then the main result, the response of various ﬂow properties to time-
modulated forcing, is presented. The paper ends with a summary and conclusions.

First, we recall that traditional agitation of the large-scale structures in a turbulent ﬂow
may be achieved by introducing a forcing term restricted to wave vectors with |k| ≤ kF , i.e.,
identifying a forcing-range through the upper-limit kF . Speciﬁcally, we force the turbulence
similarly as in [7, 11],

where εw is the constant energy injection rate and NF = NF (kF ) is the total number of forced
modes. For convenience, the wave vectors are grouped in spherical shells with the n-th shell
containing all modes such that (n − 1/2) < |k| ≤ (n + 1/2). We applied large-scale forcing
either in the ﬁrst shell at n = 1 (i.e., kF = 3/2 which implies NF = 18, the case considered

in [2]) or in the ﬁrst two shells (i.e., kF = 5/2 which implies NF = 80). The second step in

The lengths and time scales of the numerical simulation are chosen by picking L = 1 for
the box-size in physical space and εw = 0.15 for the energy injection rate. The Reynolds
number is then determined by the dimensionless viscosity ν. Choosing ν−1 = 1060.7 and
ν−1 = 4242.6 result in respective approximate Taylor-Reynolds numbers Rλ ∼= 50 and
Rλ ∼= 100. We use these two cases as references denoted by R50 and R100. The spatial
resolution needed may be estimated by requiring kmaxη > 1 [12] with η the Kolmogorov dissi-
pation scale and kmax the highest wavenumber included in the spatial discretization. For R50
case a resolution of at least N 3 = 643 computational points is required while for R100 a higher
resolution of 1923 points is necessary. The latter poses a strong computational challenge in
view of the extensive ensemble averaging and large number of modulation frequencies. How-
ever, it was found that many large scale quantities, such as the total energy, do not depend too
sensitively on resolution. As an example, a resolution of 643 points corresponds to kmaxη ≈ 0.4
for the R100 case. Still, this resolution is quite adequate for studying the response of total
energy. This was veriﬁed by repeating the analysis at a selection of modulation frequencies
with resolutions 1283 and 1923. The predictions of quantities that rely more on small scales,
such as the dissipation-rate, contain a higher numerical uncertainty for R100 case and 643 com-
putational points, but still allow a clear interpretation of the main turbulence response. This
was separately assessed using the higher resolution data at selected characteristic frequencies.
The direct numerical simulation for the unmodulated case starts from an initial condition
that was generated on the basis of the Pao spectrum [13]. We adopt exactly the same initial
conditions as in [14] which allow a separate validation of the simulations. Explicit second
order compact-storage Runge-Kutta time-stepping [15] with fully de-aliased pseudo-spectral
discretization is used. The unmodulated turbulent ﬂows provide the point of reference for
investigating the eﬀect of modulated forcing, to which we turn next.

Averaging procedure and simulation setting. – In order to analyze the response to a time-
modulated forcing, the precise extraction of the amplitude and phase of the conditionally
averaged variations is a key issue. Two steps can be distinguished, i.e., the computation
of the conditionally averaged signal itself and the subsequent determination of amplitude and
phase characteristics of this signal, see Figure 1. These steps are discussed and illustrated
next.

We adopt ensemble averaging to determine the conditionally averaged signal S(ω, t), where
S(ω, t) is the total energy E(ω, t), the Taylor-Reynolds number Rλ(ω, t) or the energy dis-
sipation rate ε(ω, t). Ensemble averaging requires a suﬃciently large sample of statistically
independent signals {Sj(ω, t)} to be generated. The computational approach is summarized
in Figure 1(a) and involves two main steps. Firstly, we compute the unmodulated ﬂow and
store Nr realizations of the turbulent solution corresponding to t > 10. The latter condition
allows transients related to the initial condition to become negligible. The time-separation
between these snapshots is larger than two eddy-turnover times. Subsequently, each of these

by their respective means T F = εw, QE(ω), and Qε(ω) obtained from simulations at the modulation
frequency ω = 0.8π (b).

Nr realizations was taken as the initial condition for a simulation with time-modulated forc-
ing at a particular frequency ω. This provides Nr sample signals which need to be averaged
to obtain the conditionally averaged signal S(ω, t). Repeating this procedure for a range
of frequencies yields the total response characteristics. Given the conditionally averaged re-
sponse signal S(ω, t), there are various ways in which amplitude and phase information can
be extracted. In [10] the signal S(ω, t) was ﬁrst averaged over time to yield S(ω). Subse-
quently, the normalized variation deﬁned as Q(a)
S (ω, t) = S(ω, t)/S(ω) was studied using the
Fourier-transform (F ) in which time t is transformed into frequency f . Correspondingly, the
Q(a)
can be obtained which assumes

a maximum value AS(ω) = max{|
S (ω, f )|}|f =fA(ω), as denoted in Figure 1(b) for forcing
AF (ω), total energy AE(ω), and energy-dissipation-rate Aε(ω). The maximum AS(ω) as the
amplitude at dominant frequency can be used to quantify the response as function of the
modulation frequency ω. This approach is accurate if Fourier-transform is applied to an inte-
ger number of modulation periods. The method used in [2] is based on a ﬁtting procedure in
which it is assumed that S(ω, t) ≈ S + AS sin
. The dependence of the parameters

At modest ensemble-size Nr it is beneﬁcial to explicitly incorporate variations in the un-
modulated reference signal to improve the data-evaluation. This motivates an alternative
method in which we determine Nr sample signals {Sj(ω, t)} corresponding to the modulated
case, as well as Nr unmodulated signals {sj(t)} that start from the same set of initial condi-
tions. This allows to generate diﬀerent ‘normalized’ signals such as Q(b)
j sj
or Q(c)
j Sj/sj/Nr. These normalized signals provide estimates that compensate to
some degree for the relatively small number of samples or for an unknown mean component

but have the drawback that they cannot be applied in the context of a physical experiment.
Additionally, we divided these signals by its means (time-averages) and removed the con-
stant component corresponding to the zero-frequency response. Application of the Fourier-
S = F
, provides direct access to
transform,
amplitude and phase information. Each of these methods identiﬁed above yields the same
(cid:1)
general impression of response maxima in time-modulated turbulence. Diﬀerences arise only
on a more detailed level of the processed data but these do not obscure the interpretation
of the main features of the response. Therefore we only present results extracted from the
(c)
normalized signal QS/QS ≡ Q(c)
S in what follows, unless explicitly stated otherwise. The
simulations were performed in the frequency range π/5 ≤ ω ≤ 80π with time-modulated
forcing at an amplitude AF = 1/5. Referring to Figure 1, for each of the Nr unmodulated
initial conditions, nT = 4 periods of the modulated forcing were simulated, i.e., each sample
signal was computed for nT T time-units with modulation-period T = 2π/ω. Since an explicit
time-stepping method was adopted, the cases at low ω add particularly to the total computa-
tional cost. The number of realizations required in the ensemble was investigated separately.
Results for several modulation frequencies were compared at Nr = 10, 30 and 50; it was found
that 30 independent samples provide adequate statistical convergence for our purposes. We
stored Nt = 40 points per modulation period and present results obtained by evaluating the
last two recorded periods, i.e., 2T ≤ t ≤ 4T . Comparison with results obtained by evaluating
data on 0 ≤ t ≤ 4T yielded only minor diﬀerences. Finally, the phase ΦS(ω) between the
forcing and the response can be computed from the Fourier-transformed data as well. At the

Modulated turbulence. – In Figure 2(a) the conditionally averaged signal QE(ω, t)/QE(ω)
based on total energy is shown at a number of modulation frequencies. The conditionally
averaged response has a clear oscillatory behavior. The Fourier-transform of the data from
Figure 2(a) is shown in Figure 2(b) and displays a dominant maximum corresponding to
the forcing frequency fA = ω/(2π). This observation conﬁrms that the least-squares ﬁtting
procedure adopted in [2] is justiﬁed.

the R50 case (labeled ⋄). The inset in (a) shows the phase-shift ΦE(ω) between the energy response
and the forcing modulation.

We now focus on the amplitude of the total energy response as function of the modula-
tion frequency ω. The amplitude AE(ω) computed as maximum of the Fourier-transformed
normalized signal for each modulation frequency is shown in Figure 3(a). The maximum
response appears at ωmax ≈ 1.5, in accordance with the expectation [1, 2] that it should be
close to the inverse large eddy turnover time. In addition, the location of the maximum is
not very sensitive to Rλ, reﬂecting that the response maximum is mainly associated with
the large-scale features in the ﬂow. At high modulation frequencies ω > ωmax the decay of
AE is proportional to ω−1, which becomes particularly visible in the compensated response
ωAE(ω), Figure 3(b). At very low modulation frequencies ω < ωmax a plateau in AE(ω) must
of course develop [1,2], as the turbulence then completely follows the forcing. Our simulations
do not achieve small enough ω to observe a pronounced plateau.

The maximum of ωAE(ω) is about 35% higher as compared to the value at high ω. This is
as expected lower than predicted by the mean-ﬁeld theory described in [1] as the ﬂuctuations
slightly smear out the mean-ﬁeld maximum, but it is much more pronounced compared to
results based on the GOY or REWA simulations [2]. The reason is that, although the ap-
pearance of the response maxima is a large-scale eﬀect, the correct resolution of the small-
scales is important for a proper quantitative representation of the eﬀect, because the small
scale resolution aﬀects the energy ﬂux downscale. We also calculated the response curves for
the Taylor-Reynolds number; the results are quite similar.

Φε(ω) between the energy-dissipation response and the forcing modulation.

energy response is shown in Figure 3(a) as inset. We observe a strong variation in this
phase-diﬀerence for modulation frequencies near the most responsive modulation frequency.
It appears that the maximum response as shown in Figure 3 occurs at a modulation frequency
where also the variation in the phase-diﬀerence is largest. A strong phase shift was found
similarly in windtunnel experiments in which a time-modulation is introduced via a periodic
cycling of an upstream active grid. In these experiments the maximum response was found to
shift to higher frequencies in case the characteristic length-scales of the forcing were reduced.
Can such a dependence on the type of forcing also be observed in our numerical sim-
ulations? To ﬁnd out we force a higher wavenumber band of modes (kF ≤ 5/2) instead
of restricting us entirely to low wavenumber forcing. The result is seen in Figure 3(b) indi-
cated by diamonds. Indeed, for this type of forcing the response maximum is less pronounced.
Further quantitative connections with physical experiments are currently being investigated.
The energy-dissipation-rate in the system is a quantity that is accessible to direct physical
experimentation.
In Figure 4 we show the energy-dissipation-rate amplitude Aε(ω). We
notice that at high modulation frequency ω the amplitude approaches zero, consistent with the
expectation that the modulation of the forcing is not eﬀective in this range. More importantly,
the energy-dissipation-rate amplitude displays a strong response maximum at the level of 85%
T
compared to the amplitude of modulation. The total mean energy-dissipation T −1
0 ε(ω, t)dt
for each modulation frequency ω is almost constant.
It diﬀers from the energy input rate
R
εw = 0.15 at the level of 1% for most of the frequencies, reaching the maximum diﬀerence of
5% for the lowest simulated frequency, conﬁrming good numerical convergence.

Summary and Conclusions. – The direct numerical simulation of the response of tur-
bulence to time-modulated forcing conﬁrms the existence of a response maximum. The sim-
ulation ﬁndings are in general agreement with predictions based on a mean-ﬁeld theory [1].
The mean-ﬁeld theory predicts the decrease of the response amplitude proportional to ω−1 as
the modulation frequency is suﬃciently large which was observed in the simulations as well.
The response maxima in the total energy and the Taylor-Reynolds number occur at the forcing

8

EUROPHYSICS LETTERS

frequencies of the order of the inverse large eddy turnover time scale. The phase-diﬀerence be-
tween the modulation of the forcing and the conditionally averaged response displays a strong
dependence on the modulation frequency as well. The modulation frequency at which the
response maximum arises depends only weakly on the Reynolds number but shows a depen-
dence on the scales included in the forcing as well as on the ﬂow-property that is considered.
In general, if the particular quantity of interest shows a stronger dependence on the smaller
scales in a turbulent ﬂow, then the response maximum arises at a somewhat higher frequency.
These ﬁndings may be independently assessed in physical experiments, e.g., conducted in wind
tunnels combined with the use of active grids cycled in a periodic sequence [16].

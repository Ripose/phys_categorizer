The inertial-range properties of quasi-stationary hydrodynamic turbulence under solid-body rota-
tion are studied via high-resolution direct numerical simulations. For strong rotation the nonlinear
energy cascade exhibits depletion and a pronounced anisotropy with the energy ﬂux proceeding
mainly perpendicularly to the rotation axis. This corresponds to a transition towards a quasi-two-
dimensional ﬂow similar to a linear Taylor-Proudman state.
In contrast to the energy spectrum
along the rotation axis which does not scale self-similarly, the perpendicular spectrum displays an
inertial range with k−2
⊥ -behavior. A new phenomenology gives a rationale for the observations. The
scaling exponents ζp of structure functions up to order p = 8 measured perpendicular to the rotation
axis indicate reduced intermittency with increasing rotation rate. The proposed phenomenology is
consistent with the inferred asymptotic non-intermittent behavior ζp = p/2.

The inherent properties of turbulence in a rotating reference frame are important for, e.g., the dynamics of atmo-
sphere and oceans, liquid planetary cores, and engineering problems. The nonlinear spectral transfer of energy by the
direct turbulent cascade and the associated energy spectrum are particularly interesting due to their direct connection
to the dynamical processes governing rotating turbulence. Most of the available experimental data [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] yields
no conclusive information on the expected self-similar scaling of the energy spectrum in the inertial range of scales
and its dependence on the rotation frequency Ω. Although recent experiments [6, 7, 8] have shed some light on these
issues, the scaling of two-point statistics in rotating turbulence remains a controversial topic.

Direct numerical simulations [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and large-eddy simulations, see e.g. [17, 18, 19], have been
carried out only at low and moderate Reynolds numbers precluding clear scaling observations. Nevertheless, most
of the cited works agree in that the nonlinear spectral transfer of energy to smaller scales diminishes with growing
Ω, accompanied by a transition of the ﬂow towards a quasi-two-dimensional state perpendicular to the ﬁxed rotation
axis, Ω. The transition manifests itself in an increasing ratio of integral length scales parallel and perpendicular to
Ω = Ωˆe3, deﬁned as Li,j =

This Letter presents high-resolution direct numerical simulations of incompressible rotating homogeneous turbulence
driven at largest scales and proposes a phenomenology of the energy cascade which suggests a physical explanation for
the observed attenuation of nonlinear spectral transfer under the inﬂuence of rotation. In addition, the model gives
a rationale for the observed trend towards two-dimensionality in rapidly rotating turbulence which is corroborated
by the simulations. The scaling of two-point structure functions perpendicular to Ω indicates a decreasing level of
intermittency with growing Ω.

Incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence under solid-body rotation is usually described by the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions including the Coriolis force [20] given here in dimensionless form with the vorticity, ω = ∇ × v, and the
non-dimensional kinematic viscosity µ and rotation frequency Ω = |Ω|,

∂tω = ∇ × (v × ω + 2v × Ω) + µ∆ω ,
∇ · v = 0 .

Equations (1) and (2) are numerically integrated using an explicit trapezoidal leapfrog scheme [21] with the diﬀusive
term included by an integrating factor, see e.g.
[22], while the remaining right-hand-side of Eq. (1) is determined
pseudospectrally. The simulation volume extends 2π in each dimension with triply periodic boundary conditions and
a resolution of 5123 collocation points. Aliasing errors are treated by spherical mode truncation [23]. Quasi-stationary
turbulence is generated by a forcing which freezes all modes in a sphere of radius kf = 2.

The initial state of the forced simulations is taken from non-rotating turbulence which has been freely decaying
for about one large-eddy-turnover time, the period needed to reach the maximum of dissipation when starting with
a smooth velocity ﬁeld. This initial velocity ﬁeld is characterized by an energy spectrum Ek ∼ exp(−k2/k2
0), k0 = 4,
and random phases. Subsequently all Fourier modes with k ≤ 2 are frozen. These modes sustain a gentle driving of
V dV v2/2,
the ﬂow by nonlinear interaction with the ﬂuctuating part of the system. As soon as total energy, E =

The dimensionless kinematic viscosity µ is 4 × 10−4 in both cases. The characteristic length L0 and velocity V0,
necessary for the calculation of macroscopic Rossby number, Ro = V0/(2ΩL0), and Reynolds number, Re = L0V0/µ,
can only be determined a posteriori in homogeneous turbulence. Both quantities are estimated on dimensional grounds
using E, ε, and Ω as L0 ∼ E/(Ωε)1/2 and V0 ∼ E1/2. Hence the Rossby and Reynolds number given in this paper are
deﬁned as Ro =
E3/(Ωε)/µ, respectively. Note that another common estimate of the Rossby
number is Ro∗ = 4Ro2.

After the sudden onset of rotation, E displays a sharp drop of about 20% (case I) and 13% (case II) with a
subsequent remount that levels oﬀ near the previous state. The dissipation rate ε follows the general dynamics of
energy, but does not increase again with ε ≃ 0.05 in both simulations. The observations can be understood by the
rotation-induced depletion of the spectral energy transfer which causes a transient until forcing and cascade have
reached a new equilibrium. The observed behavior does not diﬀer qualitatively if the rotation is ramped up (as has
been checked by test computations).

The following 15 (I) and 10 (II) large-eddy turnover times of statistically stationary rotating turbulence are charac-
terized by Ro ≃ 5.3 × 10−2, Re ≃ 4000 (I) and Ro ≃ 1.3 × 10−2, Re ≃ 2340 (II). Perpendicular one-dimensional energy
dk′|vk|2/2 with k⊥ ⊥ Ω, kk k Ω, and k′ perpendicular to k⊥ and kk, are shown in Fig. 1. The
spectra, Ek⊥ =
spectrum of system I displays a scaling range for 4 . k⊥ . 20 while in simulation II the dissipation region is starting
at smaller k (see below). In addition, the spectrum of simulation II exhibits a bump around kf where the forcing
region descends into the freely evolving range of scales. This eﬀect which is caused by the simple forcing scheme does
not seem to signiﬁcantly perturb the ﬂow beyond k ≈ 5. It is therefore tolerable at the chosen numerical resolution.
Although the inertial range in simulation II is shorter than in simulation I the perpendicular one-dimensional
energy spectra in both cases exhibit scaling, Ek⊥ ∼ k−2
⊥ , in agreement with direct numerical simulations at moderate
Reynolds-number [12] and [13](for k > kf ), and shell-model calculations [24]. A formal analysis of the energy ﬂux in
helical mode decomposition [25] leads to the same result as well as dimensional analysis of the energy ﬂux terms which
occur in quasi-normal closure theories [26, 27] when assuming τ∗ ∼ τΩ ∼ Ω−1 for the relaxation timescale of nonlinear
interactions, τ∗. The observed spectra are also in accord with one of several isotropic scalings proposed in weak
turbulence theory [28, 29]. However, this approach is only valid in the asymptotic limit τ∗ ≫ τΩ implying k ≪ kΩ
(see below) which requires very strong rotation or an extremely broad inertial range and therefore is beyond scope of
the simulations considered here. In [13] k−3-scaling is found at small wavenumbers in turbulence with medium-scale
forcing. The observation is explained dimensionally by the missing explicit ε-dependence of the spectrum at large
scales (also cf. [30] using a method based on reduced sets of nonlinear interactions). Recent experimental results [8]
suggest an energy scaling exponent ≈ −2.5 for case II with the micro Rossby number of Roω = hω2
3i1/2/(2Ω) ≃ 0.08 and
an exponent of ≈ −1.7 for case I with Roω ≃ 0.7. This disagreement is probably due to the diﬀerent way of turbulence
generation. While in the simulations there is a continuous large-scale forcing, turbulence in the experiment is exited
initially and then subject to decay under rotation. In addition the experimental Rossby numbers are signiﬁcantly
larger than in our computations. The conﬁguration is, therefore, not directly comparable to the simulations described
here. This is also true for the experiment reported in [6] although the same scaling ∼ k−2 is observed there (however
in an inverse energy cascade).
It should be noted that the kk-dependence of the perpendicular energy spectrum
(not shown) in our simulations conﬁrms the expected concentration of energy around the plane kk = 0 [31, 32].
Furthermore, the perpendicular energy spectra at speciﬁc ﬁxed kk do not show clear spectral scaling. This is only
seen in the sum Ek⊥ .

ogously. Note that the Coriolis force has no direct eﬀect on the kinetic energy since it is oriented perpendicularly to
v. It does, however, modify the nonlinear interactions leading to depletion and anisotropy of the energy cascade, cf.
also [31, 32], which is apparent when regarding Fig. 2. All normalized transfer functions for Ω = 0, 5, and 50 are
negative throughout indicating a direct energy cascade towards small-scales. They show a damping of the energy ﬂux
at all scales with increasing Ω. The cascade depletion is much stronger in Tkk than in Tk⊥. Consequently, the cascade
becomes highly anisotropic in the case of strong rotation which naturally leads to a dynamical two-dimensionalization
of the ﬂow. The transition towards 2D also manifests itself in the increasing ratio of parallel to perpendicular integral
length scales with growing Ω where strong rotation, Ω = 50, yields Li,3 up to a factor 2.5 larger than Li,1 and Li,2 for
i = 1, 2, 3. This trend is also seen in visualizations of the velocity ﬁeld (not shown). The perpendicular longitudinal
and lateral correlation lengths exhibit moderate systematic diﬀerences due to the forcing scheme which is not fully
isotropic. This, however, does not cloud the main trend of two-dimensionalization in planes perpendicular to Ω.

turbulence which is set out in the following. While inertial waves present in rotating turbulence are undoubtedly
an important dynamical process, the proposed picture of the energy cascade is based on the presumed energetic
dominance of convective motions.

The wavenumber range strongly inﬂuenced by rotation lies above the scale at which the advection nonlinearity
in Eq. (1) is roughly equal to the Coriolis force, v2
ℓ /ℓ ∼ Ωvℓ where vℓ denotes an isotropically estimated velocity
ﬂuctuation at scale ℓ ∼ k−1. Since non-rotating hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits Kolmogorov inertial-range scaling
[33], vℓ ∼ (εℓ)1/3, one obtains the well-known rotation wavenumber [25, 34], kΩ = (Ω3/ε)1/2, below which the energy
cascade is modiﬁed by the Coriolis force acting in planes perpendicular to Ω.

The nonlinear energy transfer in those planes can be estimated dimensionally as ε ∼ v2

ξ /τtr with the characteristic
velocity ﬂuctuation vξ in the axis-perpendicular plane at scale ξ ∼ k−1
⊥ . Due to the lack of an inertial range in the
direction parallel to Ω, a consequence of the quasi-2D-state, the approximation E(ℓ) ∼ v2
ξ suﬃces for the following
scaling predictions. In isotropic non-rotating hydrodynamic turbulence ﬂuid particles which belong to a turbulent
structure at scale ξ ∼ ℓ follow trajectories of length ξ for a turnover time, τtr ∼ τNL ∼ ξ/vξ, in the course of the
energy cascade. When neglecting all nonlinearities ﬂuid particles in rotating ﬂows are displaced from the no-rotation
trajectories in axis-perpendicular directions due to the Coriolis force and follow circular orbits of radius r ∼ vξτΩ
which close after τΩ ∼ Ω−1. The nonlinear terms in Eq. (1) which dominate turbulence dynamics cause a strong
deformation of the circular orbits. The deformed circles which we regard as abstract entities whose shapes can be left
unspeciﬁed will be referred to as ‘arcs’. Typically these do not close in themselves after τΩ but lead to an eﬀective
axis-perpendicular displacement ∼ r of the ﬂuid particles. It is easy to verify that in the rotation dominated range
of scales, k < kΩ, the displacement r is always smaller then ξ, requiring the ﬂuid particles to perform ξ/r ‘arc steps’
to cover the distance ξ and to complete the cascade trajectory. In fact though, the direction in which a ﬂuid particle
is deﬂected by an arc movement is quasi-stochastic. Consequently, analogous to a random walk process (ξ/r)2 arc
steps are necessary to cover the distance ξ. Therefore, the nonlinear transfer time in the axis perpendicular direction
is given by

This result has also been obtained by formal analysis of the nonlinear energy ﬂux [25] and in weak-turbulence theory
[28]. We note in passing that the rotation-modiﬁed transfer time τtr is larger than τNL with τN L ∼ τtr at kΩ. From
the previous it is clear that for k ≪ kΩ the turbulent energy cascade is highly anisotropic and progresses mainly in the
direction perpendicular to the rotation axis in accord with the dynamic Taylor-Proudman theorem, see e.g. [16, 27].
The deﬁnition of τΩ used in this paper diﬀers from the one known from weak turbulence theory which involves the
ratio k⊥/kk (see, e.g., [28]). However, both deﬁnitions approach each other when k⊥/kk for the turbulent ﬂuctuations
does not depart strongly from unity as is the case here.

With relation (3) the dimensional estimate of the nonlinear energy ﬂux is obtained as ε ∼ v4

ε = const. throughout the inertial range yields a scaling law for the velocity ﬂuctuations perpendicular to Ω,

with increasing Ω, there exists a critical rotation frequency for which the rotation-dominated regime has its largest

kΩ ≃ 50, kΩ
d ≃ 79, kd ≃ 167, R ≃ 0.05 which explains the
shorter inertial range of Ek⊥ in case II. The Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumber kd ∼ (ε/µ3)1/4 roughly identiﬁes

At the given spatial resolution scaling exponents of the axis-perpendicular longitudinal velocity structure functions,
h|[v(r) − v(r + ξ)] · ξ/ξ|pi ∼ ξζp can be determined for both systems up to order 8. However, the small inertial range
for Ω = 50 necessitates use of the extended self-similarity property (ESS) [35]. The relative exponents ζp/ζ2 obtained
via ESS approximately coincide with the ζp since relation (4) (in the non-intermittent limit) and the numerical
result Ek⊥ ∼ k−2
suggest ζ2 ≈ 1. The results shown in Fig. 3 are a sign of a gradual transition from
the intermittent non-rotating case (represented by the She-L´evˆeque formula [36], ζp = p/9 + 1 − (1/3)p/3) towards
a strongly rotating ﬂow with weak intermittency. The observed reduction of intermittency is in accord with the

expected transition from strong ﬂuid turbulence to weak inertial wave turbulence (see, e.g., [37]). The observations
coincide with experimental ﬁndings given in [7] although in this experiment the ﬂow is driven at small scales and in
contrast to our simulations exhibits an inverse cascade of energy.

In summary, high-resolution direct numerical simulations of incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence driven at
largest scales under moderate and strong rotation corroborate a proposed phenomenology of rotating turbulence
which gives a simple rationale for the overall weakening of the energy cascade and the trend towards two-dimensional
dynamics in rotating turbulent ﬂows. Higher-order structure function scalings show a transition towards a non-
intermittent state perpendicular to the rotation axis as known from 2D turbulence.

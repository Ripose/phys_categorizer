Abstract

The inﬂuence of an axial through-ﬂow on the spatiotemporal growth behavior of diﬀerent vortex

structures in the Taylor-Couette system with radius ratio η = 0.5 is determined. The Navier

Stokes equations (NSE) linearized around the basic Couette-Poiseuille ﬂow are solved numerically

with a shooting method in a wide range of through-ﬂow strengths Re and diﬀerent rates of co-

and counterrotating cylinders for toroidally closed vortices with azimuthal wave number m = 0

and for spiral vortex ﬂow with m =

1. For each of these three diﬀerent vortex varieties we

±

have investigated (i) axially extended vortex structures, (ii) axially localized vortex pulses, and

(iii) vortex fronts. The complex dispersion relations of the linearized NSE for vortex modes with

the three diﬀerent m are evaluated for real axial wave numbers for (i) and over the plane of

complex axial wave numbers for (ii, iii). We have also determined the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude

equation (GLE) approximation in order to analyze its predictions for the vortex stuctures (ii,

iii). Critical bifurcation thresholds for extended vortex structures are evaluated. The boundaries

between absolute and convective instability of the basic state for vortex pulses are determined with

a saddle-point analysis of the dispersion relations. Fit parameters for power-law expansions of

the boundaries up to Re4 are listed in two tables. Finally, the linearly selected front behavior of

growing vortex structures is investigated using saddle-point analyses of the dispersion relations of

NSE and GLE. For the two front intensity proﬁles (increasing in positive or negative axial direction)

we have determined front velocities, axial growth rates, and the wave numbers and frequencies of

the unfolding vortex patterns with azimuthal wave numbers m = 0,

1, respectively.

INTRODUCTION

2

The Taylor-Couette system [1] of ﬂuid ﬂow in the annulus between concentric cylinders

with the inner and the outer one rotating with diﬀerent velocities is one of the simplest

examples of a driven nonlinear dissipative system that shows spontaneous pattern formation

out of an unstructured basic state that is stable at small driving [5]. This basic ﬂow state

is stationary and axially and azimuthally homogeneous and shows only a radial variation

across the annular gap.

It consists of a superposition of circular Couette ﬂow (CCF) in

azimuthal direction and of an annular Poiseuille ﬂow (APF) in axial direction if as in our

case an axial through-ﬂow is imposed. Axially periodic vortex ﬂow solutions bifurcate [6, 7]

out of this homogeneous basic ﬂow when the rotation rate of the inner cylinder is suﬃciently

high. These primary bifurcation thresholds to periodic vortex stuctures have been the aim

of many linear stability analyses of the basic ﬂow state [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

For the radius ratio η = 0.5 and the parameter ranges of rotation rates and through-ﬂow

investigated here in this work three spatiotemporally diﬀering primary vortex structures are

relevant: Rotationally symmetric, toroidally closed vortices with azimuthal wave number

m = 0 that move in downstream direction with the APF — for shortness we call this ﬂow

state Taylor vortex ﬂow (TVF) although the presence of an axial through-ﬂow modiﬁes the

genuine stationary TVF stucture. And, furthermore, spiral vortex ﬂow (SPI) consisting of

either left spiral vortices (L-SPI) with m = 1 or right spiral vortices (R-SPI) with m =

1.

−

L-SPI and R-SPI are axial mirror images of each other in the absence of axial through-

ﬂow with the latter breaking the mirror symmetry of the former. While rotating azimuthally

into the same direction as the inner cylinder L-SPI propagate axially opposite to R-SPI.

This spiral dynamics is largely induced by the advective properties of the basic ﬂow state.

Furthermore, without through-ﬂow the symmetry degenerate bifurcation treshold for these

two symmetry degenerate SPI solutions is simultaneously also the bifurcation threshold for

a vortex ﬂow solution called ribbons [6]. This solution consists right at threshold of a linear

superposition of L-SPI and R-SPI with equal amplitude and it becomes further away from

threshold a genuine nonlinear vortex ﬂow solution. However, here we are dealing only with

linear vortex ﬂow ﬁelds that may be superimposed with arbitrary amplitudes as well as

wave numbers and that are evolving separately from each other according to the linear ﬁeld

equations. Thus we do not need to discuss ribbons separately from our general investigation

February 21, 2014

of linear vortex modes with general axial and azimuthal wave numbers.

In this work we quantitatively determine the inﬂuence of an axial through-ﬂow on the

spatiotemporal growth properties of linear perturbations of the basic ﬂow state with az-

imuthal wave numbers m = 0 and m =

1, i.e., of toroidally closed vortices and of spiral

±

vortices, repectively. In each case we investigate (i) axially extended structures, (ii) pulses

of axially localized wave packets of vortices, and (iii) vortex fronts.

In Sec. II we describe the system, we brieﬂy review the linearized Navier-Stokes equations

(NSE) for the eigenvalue problem describing vortex perturbations, and we give details of our

numerical procedure to solve the eigenvalue problem. In Sec. III we discuss the spatiotempo-

ral structure, symmetry properties, and bifurcation thresholds for onset of axially extended

vortex perturbations of the form ei(kz+mϕ) with real axial wave number k and diﬀerent az-

imuthal wave numbers m in the absence and presence of an axial through-ﬂow. In Sec. IV

we consider axially localized wave packets consisting of superpositions of vortex eigenmodes

of the linear NSE. Here we determine among others the boundary between convective and

absolute instability of the basic ﬂow against growth of vortices with a particular m by a

saddle point analysis of the linear complex dispersion relation of the NSE over the plane of

complex axial wave numbers. In addition we also determine the Ginzburg-Landau ampli-

tude equation (GLE) approximation for the dispersion relation for the sake of comparison.

In Sec. V we evaluate the spatiotemporal properties of linearly selected vortex fronts using

a saddlepoint analysis of the dispersion relation. Also here we compare with GLE results.

The ﬁnal section contains a summary.

II. SYSTEM

Here we describe the system and we provide deﬁnitions and equations. Then we brieﬂy

review the linearized equations for the eigenvalue problem describing vortex perturbations

of the basic ﬂow state. Finally we give details of our numerical procedure to solve the

eigenvalue problem.

C. Linear eigenvalue problem of vortex perturbations

Let ψ = (u, v, w, p) abbreviate the deviation ﬁelds from the basic ﬂow state (2.8). Then

the general solution of the NSE linearized in the deviation ﬁelds can be written as a super-

position of modes of the form

ψ(r, ϕ, z, t) = φ(r)ei(kz+mϕ)eσt

(2.16)

with axial wave number k = 2π/λ and integer azimuthal wave number m. The complex

amplitude functions

φ(r) = [U(r), V (r), W (r), P (r)]

(2.17)

depend on the mode indices k, m and the radial coordinate r. The characteristic exponent

σ(k, m) is in general complex. It is decomposed here as follows

D. Numerical procedures

We have solved the eigenvalue equations (2.28) numerically with a standard shooting

method subject to the six boundary conditions,

U = V = W = 0

at

r1 = η/(1

η) and r2 = 1/(1

η) ,

(2.32)

−

−

which make the eigenvalue spectrum discrete. To integrate from r1 to r2 we used a fourth-

order Runge-Kutta formula [15] with two step widths ( ∆r = 1/200 and 1/400, respectively)

for a Richardson extrapolation. A Newton-Raphson method [16] was then used to ﬁnd the

roots of the complex determinant of the 3

3 matrix which ensures the vanishing of U, V, W

×

at the outer cylinder. We therefore vary in the Newton-Raphson procedure only two of the

parameters (σ, η, R1, R2, Re, m, k) [8] that enter into (2.28) while keeping the others ﬁxed. In

this way we determine on the one hand the marginal threshold values of R1 and ω with γ = 0

for which the basic state is marginally stable against the growth of an extended perturbation

with given m and real axial wave number k at speciﬁed parameters η, R2, Re. On the other

hand we calculate for given m, η, R1, R2, Re the complex eigenvalue σ over the complex wave

number plane – including as special case also the real k-axis. In each case we are interested

only in the vortex modes with the largest growth rates for which the associated amplitude

functions φ(r) display the least radial variation with the fewest number of nodes.

We present here results for the radius ratio η = 0.5 in a range of outer Reynolds numbers

III. AXIALLY EXTENDED VORTEX STRUCTURES

Here we discuss the spatiotemporal structure, symmetry properties, and bifurcation

thresholds for onset of axially extended vortex perturbations with real axial wave num-

ber k and diﬀerent azimuthal wave numbers m in the absence and presence of an axial

through-ﬂow.

February 21, 2014

A. Spatiotemporal structure

9

(3.1)

−

(3.2)

Structure and dynamics of the vortex modes (2.16) are dominated by the fact that their

phases are constant on any cylindrical surface, r = const, along lines given by the equation

z0 =

ϕ +

m
k

−

ω(k, m)
k

t .

Here the constant phase coming from the amplitude φ(r) is suppressed. Thus, on the ϕ

z

plane of such an ’unrolled’ cylindrical surface these lines of constant phase are straight.

1. Taylor vortex like patterns — m=0

For rotationally symmetric Taylor vortex like perturbations the line pattern of constant

phases, kz0 = n2π, is parallel to eϕ. The m=0 pattern is stationary for Re = 0. Only for

ﬁnite through-ﬂow it propagates axially with phase velocity

wphase =

ω
k

that is proportional to Re. The main reason for this is that the azimuthal ﬂow of the basic

CCF state is precisely parallel to the vortex lines of constant phase while the APF ﬂow

being perpendicular to them can advect them. The latter happens in our axially periodic

system that does not exert any phase pinning at the axial boundaries as soon as Re > 0.

2. Spiral patterns — m

= 0

The vortex modes (2.16) with axial wave number m

= 0 have spiral structure. When

m/k is positive (negative) the lines of constant phase z0(ϕ, t) (3.1) wind in a left spiral L-SPI

(right spiral R-SPI) around the cylindrical surface r = const with negative (positive) slope

m/k. The lines of constant phase and with it the whole spiral stucture rotates in

∂ϕz0 =

−

ϕ rigidly with angular velocity

˙ϕSP I =

ω
m

.

(3.3)

In the absence of an externally imposed through-ﬂow, Re=0, this rotation proceeds for L-

SPI and R-SPI alike into the same direction as the rotation of the inner cylinder. The reason

is that the spiral perturbations are advected by the inner part of the azimuthal CCF which

6
6
February 21, 2014

10

is relevant for the centrifugal instability leading to vortex generation. A model explaining

this eﬀect is presented in [17].

There are two immediate consequences of this advective origin of the spiral dynamics

induced by the inner cylinder’s rotation: (i) With the latter being by deﬁnition positive –

in this work the inner cylinder is taken to rotate in positive ϕ-direction – also ω(k, m)/m is

positive for Re=0. Hence, say, an m = 1 (m =

1) spiral has positive (negative) frequency

−

for Re=0. (ii) Then a L-SPI (R-SPI) being deﬁned by m/k > 0 (m/k < 0) propagates for

Re=0 upwards (downwards) with positive (negative) axial phase velocity

wphase =

=

˙ϕSP I

(3.4)

that is directly related to its positive angular velocity ˙ϕSP I.

An externally applied axial through-ﬂow changes the axial phase velocities and frequencies

of the m = 0 and m

= 0 vortex modes roughly proportional to Re, i.e.,

wphase(k, m, Re)

wphase(k, m, Re = 0)

Re .

(3.5)

−

∝

Simultaneously the rotation rates, ˙ϕSP I = wphasek/m, of the spirals are changed accordingly.

Thus, in each case the vortex frequencies are largely determined by the basic state’s advective

properties, i.e., by the combination of azimuthal advection by vCCF and axial advection by

wAP F .

Here we consider symmetry properties of axially extended vortex perturbations of the

form (2.16) with real wave number k. Symmetry relations between diﬀerent vortex fronts

Thus one infers, for example, that the growth rate (frequency) of the characteristic expo-

and that the spatiotemporal structure including the amplitude functions of a L-spiral per-

turbation (k/m > 0) at Re > 0 is the same as that of a R-spiral (k/m < 0) at Re < 0.

Note, however, that any ﬁnite through-ﬂow breaks the axial mirror symmetry between L-

and R-spirals at Re = 0 so that, among others,

γR(

Re) = γL(Re)

= γR(Re) = γL(

when Re

= 0. But the symmetry relations are such that it suﬃces to investigate, say,

positive k combined together with either (i) m > 0 only for positive and negative Re or,

equivalently, (ii) m positive and negative for Re > 0 only in order to get the complete linear

information on both spiral vortex types.

patterns with the respective critical wave numbers, kc(R2), as functions of R2 in the absence

of through-ﬂow.

The vertical lines in Fig. 1 mark the two outer Reynolds numbers R2 = 0 and R2 =

125 for which we show in Fig. 2 as representative examples how the critical thresholds

−
evolve with through-ﬂow Reynolds number Re. The above discussed symmetry relation

γR(

Re) = γL(Re) between the growth rates of R- and L-spirals implies the corresponding

relation between the respective bifurcation thresholds (full and dashed lines in Fig. 2). In

the remainder of this paper we therefore restrict ourselves without loss of information to

−

positive Re.

For small Re > 0 the axial ﬂow stabilizes the basic state against growth of TVF (m = 0)

and R-SPI (m =

1) perturbations. On the other hand, the bifurcation threshold for L-

−

decreases at small Re and increases only at larger Re. The upwards shift of the m = 0

threshold with increasing Re is stronger than the one for m = 1. Thus, eventually the latter

comes to lie below the former and consequently the growth of L-spirals propagating into the

same direction as the through-ﬂow is favored for suﬃciently large Re even when R2 = 0.

Dotted lines in Fig. 3 show the reduced critical threshold curves ǫc(Re) (2.4) as functions

of Re for the two representative outer Reynolds numbers R2 = 0 and R2 =

125. The other

lines in Fig. 3 are discussed in Sec. IV. Our numerical results for ǫc(Re) that were obtained

in steps of δRe = 1 were ﬁtted in the range Re =

IV. LOCALIZED VORTEX PERTURBATIONS

So far we have considered axially extended vortex perturbations of the form ψ(r, ϕ, z, t) =

φ(r)ei(kz+mϕ) which are single eigenmodes of the operator

(2.30). For supercritical control

L

parameters, R1 > R1c(m), a ﬁnite band of axial wave numbers can grow and with it also

axially localized wave packets consisting of superpositions of vortex modes.

A. Vortex packets

Let us consider ﬁrst an inﬁnitesimal initial perturbation with azimuthal wave number m

that is axially localized, i.e., a wave packet that consists of a superposition of vortex modes

of diﬀerent k but common m – an initial perturbation containing diﬀerent m-modes would

be just a sum of the above described vortex packets that would evolve independently of each

other as long as the linear description is valid.

After fast transients have decayed a pulse like perturbation survives with axial wave

numbers within the unstable band centered around the wave number of maximal growth

kmax(m)

kc(m). Since the above described wave packet contains vortex modes that can

≃

13

(4.1)

grow the pulse will grow as well. Simultaneously the pulse center travels axially for small ǫ

vg =

∂ω(k)
∂k (cid:12)
kc
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Hence when at a bifurcation threshold the frequency is nonzero with a ﬁnite group velocity

then the supercritical spatiotemporal growth behavior of an axially localized vortex pertur-

bation diﬀers signiﬁcantly from an axially extended vortex mode. The growth of the latter

is axially uniform which is not the case for the former.

Furthermore, one has to distinguish between two diﬀerent supercritical regimes for the

former: (i) In the so-called convectively unstable parameter regime of the basic state the

vortex packet moves with the velocity vg faster away than it grows – while growing in

the frame comoving with vg the pulse moves out of the system so that the basic state is

restored [18, 19]. In other words, the two fronts that join the pulse intensity envelope to

the structureless state propagate both in the direction in which the packet center moves.

(ii) In the so called absolutely unstable parameter regime the growth rate of the packet is

so large that one front propagates in the laboratory frame opposite to the center motion.

Thus, the packet expands not only into the direction of the pulse motion but also opposite

to it [18] so that eventually the initial perturbation can ﬁll the entire system. But the linear

growth analysis of the vortex ﬁelds does not determine in what nonlinear ﬁnal stable state

the system will end nor what possible intermediate nonlinear transient behavior might occur.

However, this analysis has an important implication for experiments with through-ﬂow:

Developed vortex structures can be seen in ﬁnite systems with vortex suppressing inlet

conditions only in the absolutely unstable regime which is typically realized at larger R1 >

R1c (cf. Fig. 3) if one leaves aside noise-sustained patterns [20, 21] in the convectively

unstable regime. In this latter regime the vortex front that connects to the zero amplitude

inlet condition moves downstream (we assume that the fronts of our forwards bifurcating

vortex structures are linearly selected thus excluding the buildup of nonlinear fronts that

might revert their propagation direction). In the absolutely unstable regime, on the other

hand, an upstream motion of this front is stopped by the inlet condition at a characteristic

downstream growth length from the inlet. This growth length of the downstream evolving

vortex structure diverges [22, 23] when approaching the boundary between convective and

absolute instability from the latter regime.

February 21, 2014

It is remarkable that based on the experimental observations of Takeuchi and Jankowski

[9] such a behavior was discussed already in 1979 [cf. ﬁgures 4 and 5(a) and their discussion

in Sec. 6 of ref. [9]], albeit without invoking the concept of absolute and convective instability

[18] which was introduced to a broader ﬂuid dynamics community only a few years later

[19].

B. Boundary between convective and absolute instability: saddle point analysis

The boundary between convective and absolute instability of the basic ﬂow against growth

of vortices with a particular azimuthal wave number m is marked by those parameter combi-

nations for which one of the fronts of the linear packet of m-vortices reverts its propagation

direction in the laboratory frame: In the convectively unstable parameter regime this front

propagates in the same direction as the center of the packet, in the absolutely unstable

regime it moves opposite to it, and right on the boundary between the two regimes the front

is stationary in the laboratory frame.

This parameter combination can be determined by a saddle point analysis of the linear

complex dispersion relation σ(Q) over the plane of complex wave numbers [5, 19]

C. Numerical procedures

In order to determine the boundary between convective and absolute instability via the

solution of eqs. (4.4, 4.5) one has to evaluate the dispersion relation σ(Q) for complex Q

[21, 24]. To that end we solved the eigenvalue problem (2.28) of the full ﬁeld equations for

complex Q (cf., Sec. IV C 2). In addition and for comparison we used for σ(Q) the Ginzburg-

Landau amplitude equation approximation which only requires knowledge of σ(k) along the

real k-axis.

2. Dispersion relation σ(Q) of the NSE for complex Q

D. Results

In Fig. 4 we show the Re-variation of the real and imaginary parts of the relevant saddle-

−

Case (a) is representative for a situation where the GLE approximation reasonably well

reproduces the correct result – at least for small Re – and starts to deviate signiﬁcantly
only for larger Re. On the other hand, in case (b) the GLE approximation to k∗ displays
a smooth variation with Re that reﬂects the smooth variation of the saddle Q∗
GLE (4.14)
of σGLE(Q) (4.13) while the real part k∗ of the saddle location of the correct dispersion

relation undergoes a dramatic change around Re

0.8. The reason is that the surfaces

≃
σ(Q) over the Q-plane for the two largest eigenvalues intersect and change

of γ(Q) =

ℜ

their order along the γ axis. Thus, the saddle that is relevant for the c

a transition and

−

that has the largest γ value switches from one eigenvalue surface to another. Similarly the

eigenvalue surface might have another saddle and their ordering in γ changes. In contrast

to that the GLE approximation produces only a single eigenvalue tracing out the smooth

surface σGLE(Q) (4.13).

To give an impression of such an intersection of the correct dispersion surfaces we show

in Fig. 5 their real parts over the complex Q

plane at Re = 5, µ = µc−a. Full lines

−

in Fig. 6 show diﬀerent constant-k sections through them in the intersection range. At

Re = 5, µ = µc−a the saddle has moved already away from the intersection region. The
saddle coordinates (Q∗

While the saddle locations Q∗

GLE of the GLE approximation σGLE(Q) (4.13) can diﬀer
substantially from the saddle Q∗ of the correct dispersion relation the diﬀerence in the

boundaries between convective and absolute instability is typically much less pronounced

– cf, e.g., the dashed and full curves for ǫc−a in Fig. 3. There the GLE results (dashed

lines) agree in each case quite well with the correct boundaries (full lines) up to, say Re =

5. However, as a consequence of the typical increase of the reduced boundary µc−a with

increasing Re the quality of the GLE results for µc−a generally deteriorates. After all the

GLE is strictly valid only for µ

0. Fig. 7 shows an example (m = 1, R2 =

125) where

−

the GLE prediction for the boundary shows even a qualitative diﬀerent variation with Re

for, say, Re > 15. We have observed similar behavior – partly at larger Re – also for other

combinations of m, R2.

Tables II and III contain the coeﬃcients for ﬁtting our results for ǫc−a(m = 0, R2, Re)

and ǫc−a(m = 1, R2, Re) in the same way as described in Sec. III C. Also here the boundary

curves for R-SPI (m =

1) are obtained according to Sec. III B from those for L-SPI (m = 1)

V. FRONTS AND PULSES

The vortex fronts that we are investigating here and that appear also as constituents of

vortex pulses are perturbations of the basic state where the ﬁelds (locally) have the form

ei(k∗z−ω∗t)eK ∗(z−v∗t)eimϕ

ψ

∼

(5.1)

in the laboratory frame. This form describes long-time spatiotemporal properties of uniquely
selected linear fronts [5]. Axial front velocity v∗, axial growth rate K ∗ of the front envelope,
wave number k∗ of the vortex pattern under the front, and its frequency ω∗ are determined by

the saddle behavior of the linear complex dispersion relation σ(Q, m) = γ(Q, m)

of the ﬁeld equations over the plane of complex axial wave numbers Q = k

iω(Q, m)

−
iK. Since

−

superpositions of vortex perturbations with diﬀerent m evolve independently from each other

within the linear description as mentioned already in Sec. IV A we consider here only fronts

of vortex perturbations that have a common azimuthal wave number m and we do not always

display the latter explicitly.

The saddle condition is [5]

A. Notation

The front envelope of (5.1) varies axially with eK ∗z. If K ∗ > 0, then the perturbation

grows at z =
out of the basic state. We call such a front to be of type + and identify the
associated front properties by a subscript +. On the other hand, for K ∗ < 0 we have a front

−∞

of type

−
subscripts

±

with an intensity envelope that joins at z =

identify the axial variations of the front envelopes. A pulse-like perturbation

of the basic state would consist suﬃently away from its center of a + front for z

and

→ −∞

of a

front for z

. Correspondingly the eqs. (5.4) have two diﬀerent solutions: one

of them describes a

front and the other one a + front. A schematic plot of the diﬀerent

→ ∞

−

envelope types can be seen in Fig. 8.

We identify the vortex pattern that is unfolded under a front either by its azimuthal wave

number m or by the superscripts T, L, R. Here T refers to a TVF-like pattern of vortices

with m = 0, L denotes L-spiral vortices with m = 1, and R identiﬁes R-spiral vortices with

m =

1. Hence m or equivalently the superscripts identify the spatiotemporal structure of

the vortex pattern growing under the front. In this work we restrict ourselves to these three

vortex varieties. Since they appear under the above described two front envelopes there are

−

−

six diﬀerent fronts that we have investigated here.

B. Results

In Fig. 9 the results of our investigations are shown for fronts with azimuthal wave

numbers m = 0, 1, and -1 for axial through-ﬂow Reynolds numbers Re =0, 10, and 20.

In each case the outer cylinder is at rest, R2 = 0. The front properties are presented as

(cf. Sec. V B 2). We therefore continue the discussion of our results in the following two

sections V B 1 and V B 2.

They reasonably well describe the small-µ behavior of the correct front properties (full

Note that for TVF fronts with m = 0, Re = 0 the GLE predicts ω∗ = 0 whereas the correct
µ2 that is beyond the

dispersion in Fig. 9(a) seems to show for small µ a variation of ω∗

range of applicability of the GLE. Thus, under the linear part of a moving TVF front there
should be a non zero phase propagation in the laboratory frame with phase velocity ω∗/k∗.

The analogous behavior was found also for convection rolls in the Rayleigh-B´enard system

[27].

At the boundary between convective and absolute instability, µ = µc−a, the velocity v∗

and the temporal growth rate γ∗

+ of the + front vanish in the laboratory frame while v∗

positive there (and given by 2 vg within the GLE approximation). Note that according to

Fig. 3 and tables II and III µc−a is zero for m = 0, Re = 0 and very small for m =

In ref. [10] it was remarked that the phase velocity of spiral patterns in axial ﬂow through

a system of radius ratio η = 0.95 [28] deviates from the critical one, ωc/kc, of axially extended

vortex perturbations. While we have done only calculations for η = 0.5 our results of Fig. 9

and of the small-µ GLE approximation (5.5 - 5.9) shed some light on the existence of such

deviations. Since the experimental vortex structures grow in downstream direction under

intensity fronts one strictly speaking would have to compare with the phase velocity under

such fronts that connect in the absolutely unstable regime to the fully developed downstream

vortex pattern. Such a nonlinear analysis has been done for m = 0 patterns [23] but not for
spirals. However, already the phase velocities ω∗

+ under our linear + fronts that grow in
downstream direction diﬀer from the corresponding critical phase velocities ωc/kc of axially

+/k∗

extended patterns — cf. Fig. 9 and eqs. (5.5 - 5.9).

2. Symmetries

The front properties shown in Fig. 9 are largely inﬂuenced by the symmetry properties

of the system without through-ﬂow although a ﬁnite Re changes them.

Invariance of the ﬁeld equations under z

z for Re = 0 implies that stationary

perturbations with ωc = 0 (TVF) under a + front are mirror images of those under a

Now consider L and R perturbations. Here the invariance of the ﬁeld equations under

z for Re = 0 implies ﬁrst of all that a spatially extended L-SPI with uniform amplitude

is the mirror image of a spatially extended R-SPI. Furthermore, a L-SPI under a + front

with positive K is symmetry degenerate with a R-SPI under a

front with negative K.

Similarly a R-SPI under a + type front is the mirror image of a L-SPI under a

front. This

implies for Re = 0 the symmetry relations

They can be seen to be realized in Fig. 9(b) and Fig. 9(c).

VI. SUMMARY

We have determined the inﬂuence of an axial through-ﬂow on the spatiotemporal growth

behavior of structurally diﬀerent vortex perturbations of the basic Couette-Poiseuille ﬂow

February 21, 2014

23

in the Taylor-Couette system with radius ratio η = 0.5. To that end we have solved the

linearized NSE numerically with a shooting method for vortex perturbations with azmuthal

wave numbers m = 0 (TVF), m = 1 (L-SPI), and m =

1 (R-SPI) in a wide range of the

−

parameters Re, R1, and R2. Here symmetry properties allowed us to restrict ourselves to

positive through-ﬂow Reynolds numbers Re. For each of the three diﬀerent vortex varieties

we have investigated (i) axially extended vortex structures with homogeneous amplitudes,

(ii) axially localized vortex pulses consisting of a linear superposition of axially extended

vortex modes with diﬀerent real axial wave numbers k, and (iii) vortex fronts.

Central to our analysis is the determination of the complex dispersion relations σ(Q) of

the linearized NSE for vortex modes with the three diﬀerent m. We have evaluated σ over

the plane of complex wave numbers Q = k

iK for patterns (ii, iii) and along the real

−
k-axis for pattern (i). We have also determined the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation

approximation σGLE(Q) in order to analyze its predictions for the vortex stuctures (ii, iii) in

comparison with the correct NSE dispersion relation σ(Q). In each case symmetry relations

are elucidated.

First we have evaluated the critical bifurcation thresholds R1c(Re, R2, m) for axially ex-

tended vortex structures. Then using a saddle-point analysis of σ(Q) we have determined

the boundaries R1c−a(Re, R2, m) between absolute and convective instability of the basic

state at which one of the fronts of the expanding vortex pulses reverts its propagation direc-

tion in the laboratory frame. Here we have elucidated also in some detail how the diﬀerent

saddle topologies of σ(Q) and of σGLE(Q) explain some of the shortcomings of the latter.
Fit parameters for power-law expansions of the reduced boundaries ǫc, ǫc−a, and ǫGLE

c−a up to

Re4 are listed in two tables.

Finally we have determined the linearly selected front behavior of growing vortex patterns

with m = 0,

1 for R2 = 0 under two diﬀerent types of front intensity envelopes: type +

±

shows growth in positive z-direction while type

locates growth in negative z-direction.

The combination of the three diﬀerent dynamics of the constituent vortex modes (m =

) leads to six diﬀerent fronts

wave number k∗, and frequency ω∗ as determined via a saddle point analysis of the respective

−

dispersion relations diﬀer in general from each other in the presence of a through-ﬂow.

Abstract

In this paper we discuss a theoretical model for the interfacial profiles of progressive
non-linear waves which result from introducing a triangular obstacle, of finite height,
attached to the bottom below the flow of a stratified, ideal, two layer fluid, bounded
from above by a rigid boundary. The derived equations are solved by using a nonlinear
perturbation method. The dependence of the interfacial profile on the triangular
obstacle size, as well as its dependence on some flow parameters, such as the ratios of
depths and densities of the two fluids, have been studied.

Introduction

The determination of flow patterns over obstacles is a problem of a great interest, that
attracted many scientists over the past decades. Lamb [6] was the first to give the essential
features of the flow of an ideal fluid in an open channel in the presence of an obstruction
in the channel. In 1955, Long [7] and then later on McIntyre [8] in 1972, considered the
case of a steady and uniform stratification over obstacles of finite height, while Mei and
LeMehaute [9] in 1966 studied the case of long waves in shallow water over an uneven
bottom. The effect of the irregularities of the bottom, on gravity waves, has been studied
by Kakutani [4] in 1971 via a reductive perturbation method. Recently, Kevorkian and
Yu [5], in 1989, studied the behaviour of shallow water waves excited by a small amplitude
bottom disturbance in the presence of a uniform incoming flow. In this paper we study
a theoretical model for the interfacial profiles of progressive non-linear waves result from
introducing a triangular obstacle, attached to the bottom below the flow of a stratified,
ideal, two layer fluid, bounded from above by a rigid boundary. Our primary motivation

for the present investigation is calculate the shape of the interfacial waves, and to discuss
the influence of both geometrical and flow parameters on the profiles. In section 2, we
extended the mathematical technique applied by Helal & Molines [3], 1981, in determining
the nonlinear free-surface and interfacial waves in a tank with flat horizontal bottom.
Nonlinear perturbation technique is used, leading, in sections 3 and 4, to expression for
interfacial wave, was derived in the form of expansions in powers of ε2, where ε is a small
parameter that provides a measure of weakness of dispersion. Boutros, et al [1], in 1991,
applied the same technique to study the internal waves over a ramp.

Finally, in section 5 we have discussed the effect of the density ratio, R, the thickness

ratio, H, and the triangle height, L.

2 Formulation of the problem

Two-dimensional irrotational motion of a stably stratified two-layer fluid with a rigid
upper boundary and a bottom surface in the form of a triangle with two inclination angles
α and β. A cartesian coordinate system is defined with the origin at the bottom surface.
We assume that the motion is two-dimensional, and the fluid is inviscid, incompressible,
and that the flow field due to the wave motion remains irrotational and consequently we
can introduce velocity potentials of upper and lower layers are denoted by Φ∗(i), i = 1, 2,
respectively. Moreover, let H ∗
i , ρ(i); i = 1, 2 denote the thickness and densities of the upper
and lower fluids, respectively, τ ∗ is the time, Y ∗ = W ∗(X ∗) is the bed of the channel and
Y ∗ = f ∗(X ∗, τ ∗) is the interfacial disturbance from uniform condition. The component of
gravity, vertically downwards, is g. The equations of motion are thus the Euler equations
together with the continuity equation. All variables are non-dimensionalized by using the
characteristic length H ∗

2 )−1/2, and accordingly

Moreover, assuming that the fluids are in the undisturbed uniform state up/down stream
at infinity, we impose the following boundary conditions with respect to X ∗

∗(i)
X∗ = U

Φ

(i = 1, 2)

as X

∗ → ±∞.

An essential step which makes our problem easier in handling is to define an appropriate
stretching of the horizontal coordinate while leaving the vertical coordinate unchanged due
to the fact that the horizontal dimensions are much greater than the vertical dimensions,
thus we define

x = εX,

y = Y,

t = ετ,

where ε is a small parameter. Thus the basic equations for this system can be written as

ε2Φ(1)

xx + Φ(1)

yy = 0,

f < y < 1 + H, −∞ < x < ∞,

ε2Φ(2)

xx + Φ(2)

yy = 0,

Thus the problem is now reduced to solving equations (14) and (15) for B(i) and C (i) and
next equations (20), (21) and (24) for D(i) and E(i), where i = 1, 2.

4 Case of progressive wave

It must be remarked that our procedure is valid as long as a ≫ ε2, otherwise a two-
parameter analysis has to be carried out. Moreover, we shall invoke the smallness of a

B(i) = B(i)

5 Presentation of results and discussion

The number of terms which has been obtained seems to be a good measure for the purpose
of illustrating the effect of the parameters the density ratio, R, the thickness ratio, H,
and the obstacle height, L. The error, difference between the fourth and second order
approximations, in the interfacial profile for the two approximations is of order 10−6. Thus
we limit our calculations up to the second-order approximation, as well as we considered
the following values for the description of the triangular obstacle: xm = 13 and xe = 30.
We studied the effect of the density ratio, R, on the wave profiles at the interfacial
surface. Three values of R have been considered, namely R = 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 for fixed
values of H, L, and t. It is clear that as R decreases, there is a kind of violent oscillations in
the obstacle region. This phenomena vanishes gradually as “R” increases. An important
remark must be mentioned is that, for the interfacial wave in the downstream region, the
period of oscillation is much longer for the case when the two fluids are of very nearly
equal density than that of significant different densities. This is due to the fact that the
presence of the upper fluid has the effect of decreasing the velocity of propagation of the
wave which consequently causes the decrease of the potential energy of a given deformation
of the interface as well as the increase of the inertia. This result comes in good agreement
with Lamb [6], who gave a marvelous natural example for such a phenomena, occurring
near the mouths of some of the Norwegian fiord, when there is a layer of fresh water over
salt water.

The interfacial wave profiles, f (x, t), has been studied for different values of the thick-
ness ratio, H, namely H = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 while the other parameters R, L, and t are
fixed. It is clear that as H increases, there is an increase in the amplitude of the wave
along the obstacle interval, as well as an increase in the wave length.

We study the effect of changing the triangle height, L. Three values of L have been
considered, namely L = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 for fixed values of R, H, and t. For the
interfacial wave, as L increases a kind of violent disturbance in the wave profile appears,
starting by a sudden increase in the profile, ending by a steep decrease at the beginning
of the downstream interval. The behaviour of that solution can be interpreted, following
Kakutani [4], as follows: a given smooth waveform will propagate along the characteristic
curves, gradually steepen its shape due to nonlinear interactions, and then the dispersive
term will begin to play its role to balance this steeping.

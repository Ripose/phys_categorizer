On the nature of intermittency in weakly
dissipative systems

Abstract

We propose a new perspective on the intermittency in weakly dissipative
systems. It is focused on the elementary (burst-like) event separating states with
diﬀerent properties. This event is seen as a real-space-time manifestation of an
instanton connecting in an extended space-time states with distinct topology of
the idealized version of the system.

I.

Introduction

The intermittency is in general associated with particular statistical prop-
erties of a ﬂuctuating quantity like the ﬁelds describing the turbulent ﬂuid or
In certain regimes the nonlinear dynamics generates cuasi-coherent
plasma.
structures like vortices and the high correlations of these formations induce
a non Gaussian statistics. The random generation and destruction of cuasi-
coherent vortices is one of the sources of intermittency in ﬂuid and plasma. The
slow algebraic decay of the spectrum at high wavenumbers is also considered a
manifestation of the intermittency. In this case the random events consisting
of rapid energy exchanges at small spatial scales should be attributed to vortex
merging or island coalescence, processes which generates quasi-singular layers at
reconnection. For other dynamical systems, the intermittency is manifested as a
random sequence of bursts, i.e. time localised, strong increase of the amplitude
of the ﬁeld. These events separate states where the system preserves stationary
properties, like are the regular ﬂows or the turbulence with stationary statisti-
cal properties. During such an event, which is very short in time, the ﬁeld is
highly irregular, producing in general a reorganization of the ﬂow. To simplify
the terminology we will say that the intermittent events separate states with
stationary properties (SWSP) of the system.

We note that the statistical perspective on the intermittency is mainly obser-
vational or attempts to characterize the statistical properties (spectrum, scaling
lows of the correlations) on the basis of the general properties of the dynamical
equations, like symmetry and conservation.

As an alternative to the statistical approach we propose in this paper a gen-
eral model for the intermittency, regarded as a dynamical process leading to fast
and signiﬁcant changes in the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. We take as the essential char-
acteristic of the intermittency the events consisting of passages between states
with stationary properties of the system. In many cases it can be recognized,
for ideal systems, a SWSP as a family of conﬁgurations with the same topology.
Consider for example a number of vortices moving in an ideal ﬂuid. Because
the ﬂuid is ideal it is not possible to go from one topological conﬁguration (for
exemple n vortices) to a diﬀerent one (n′
= n vortices) since the passage re-
quires breaking and reconnection of the ﬂow lines which in turn depends on
the presence of resistivity (in general, of dissipation). In real space-time these
transitions are not allowed and the ideal system is constrained to evolve inside
a family of topologically equivalent states, what we have deﬁned as a regime
of SWSP. But even for the ideal system, if the space-time is adequately ex-
tended it may be possible, under certain conditions, that the transitions can be
realized. The passage taking place in an extended space-time between conﬁg-
urations with distinct topological content will be called instanton, in analogy
with the instantons connecting states of degenerate vacua in ﬁeld theory.

Compared to the ideal case, the evolution of the weakly dissipative system
consists of motions which are homotopically equivalent and, from time to time,
transitions between distinct conﬁgurations, the transitions being only allowed

2

due to the presence of the dissipation. The essential idea of the model we propose
is that these dissipative transitions are not arbitrary: these transitions evolve in
a way which is the manifestation in real space-time of the instantons connecting
topologically distinct conﬁgurations in the extended space-time. These transi-
tions in real space-time are only possible if it exists for the particular system a
topological structure in which are embedded both the initial and the ﬁnal real
space conﬁgurations.

II.

Intermittency and singularities in the plane of complex
time

Many numerical studies have been done for systems exhibiting intermittency
in the form of burst-like events. It has been found that there is a connection
between the positions of these events on the time axis and the positions of the
singularities of the solution in the complex time plane. This has ﬁrst been
shown by Frisch and Morf1 in a study of a nonlinear diﬀerential equation for
the variable (velocity) v in the presence of damping γ and random drive f (t):

The numerical results show that the singularity is located above the burst event
and that the amplitude is larger when the singularity is closer to the real time
axis. The connection has been investigated using the Fourier representation of
the solution.

This study presented a certain ressemblence with the problem of integrabil-
ity of second-order ordinary diﬀerential equation, which has been formulated by
Painlev´e in the form of a precise criterion: a second order diﬀerential equation
is integrable if the only movable singularities of the solution, in the complex
plane of the variable (e.g. time), are poles. The analogy between the intermit-
tency/singularity and integrability/singularity problems has inspired a consider-
able eﬀort of characterizing by numerical methods the nature and the position
in the complex plane of the singularities, eventually leading to the extension
of the Painlev´e criterion to larger classes of equations. Part of these studies
have been devoted to understanding chaos (via Melnikov integral) as opposed
to the integrability. More connected with the problem of intermittency are the
numerical studies of the following system23:

dissipation (i.e. contact with a thermal bath). But in an extension of the
space-time (here simply : imaginary time) there are instantons (or topological
solitons) connecting the two states.
In this particular case we can precisely
identify them, since the equation describes a ϕ4 theory and the solution is (u is

singularities and the intermittent bursts.

III. The conjecture

We formulate once more the basic idea56: the burst-like intermittency is a
real-space/time manifestation of an instanton transition between topologically
distinct conﬁgurations generalizing states with stationary properties (SWSP).
The projection on real-space/time is only allowed in the presence of dissipation.
This is nothing but a conjecture and we have to gather solid arguments to
support it. However this idea already suggests a series of steps to be taken in
examining the model of an intermittent system.

1. First, we have to ﬁnd an ideal version of the system, e.g. by supressing
the dissipation part. Actually this is often invoked in the examination of
the onset of chaos in systems weakly perturbed around integrability.

2. Then the ideal model which is closest to the real one must be examined for
identifying the distinct topological classes to which the solutions belong.

3. Next we have to extend the system: not only the space-time must be ex-
tended (to larger dimensionality and/or complex variables) but the equa-
tion of the model must be embedded into a larger system (e.g. the simple
pendulum equation is reduced from a self-dual Yang-Mills model).

4. In this extended theory one should look for instantons connecting conﬁg-
urations of distinct topological classes. The existence of these solutions is
the exclusive condition for the possibility of real space/time intermittency.

4

5. One should be able to ﬁnd also the nature of singularities of these in-
stantons, whose signature could still be identiﬁable after returning to the
original real-space/time system. This will help to localize the bursts by
their relation with the extended space/time singularities.

The extension of the theory and of the space-time means the inclusion of
the theory into a much larger context. For the ideal system it is necessary to
represent its SWSP as states with nontrivial topological content. The instantons
are transitions from one topological (SWSP) state to another.

In general one should expect that in arbitrary extension of the theory in-
stantons do not exist, due to topological constraints. The instanton must be a
solution of the extended system having as initial condition a conﬁguration with
a particular topology and as target a conﬁguration with a diﬀerent topology.
Most frequently, the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations are sections of ﬁbre bundles,
as is the case for the O (n) model. Connecting two conﬁgurations ﬁrst requires
to embed both homotopy classes to which belong the two sections into one single
object.

Of particular importance is to correctly infer the extended theory whose
equation must reduce to the original ones when we return to the real space-
time. There is however a series of deep connections that have been revealed in
recent years between classical integrable or topological diﬀerential equations and
the Self-Dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) ﬁeld theory. Reducing equations from SDYM
has been done for many well known diﬀerential equations, as will be discussed
bellow. On the other hand there are precise situations where the construction
of instantons as geometric-algebraic objects can be done systematically, using
twistor theory. While these instruments are very useful in investigating the
conjecture, they do not automatically lead to successful determination of the
extended theory.

IV. Arguments supporting the conjecture

The requirement to enlarge the theoretical framework of the ideal version of
the system to a more complex theory can be formulated conversely: the ideal
system should result by reduction from a more general theory where instantons
can be found connecting the states of distinct topology. There is a large number
of ideal systems with exceptional integrability properties, which can be derived
by reduction from the Self-Dual Yang-Mills theory. For eaxample the inte-
grable hierarchies8 (KdV, Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation, sine-Gordon, etc.),
the Painlev´e transcendents,9 etc. The self duality equations have solutions with
nontrivial topology inherited from the structure of ﬁbre bundle deﬁned by the
base space and the group of automorphism of the typical ﬁbre, most frequently
(for principal ﬁbre bundles) the algebra of symmetry group. Self duality (equal-
ity of the curvature two form with its Hodge dual) provides nonzero Chern class.
It is in this framework that the ﬁrst examples of instantons (in particular the ’t
Hooft-Polyakov instanton) have been found. We shall see bellow that one can

5

construct instantons as Riemann surfaces, at least for simple topology of the
SWSP conﬁgurations.

V. An example

The simplest example of topological nontrivial state is represented by a
closed line on a torus surface.
It is speciﬁed by two integer numbers (m, n)
which means that m turns must be made in the toroidal direction and respec-
tively n in the poloidal direction for the line to close in itself. Any homotopic
deformation preserves (m, n). A line with a diﬀerent pair (m′, n′) cannot be
deformed into the ﬁrst one, i.e. the homotopy classes are labeled by the two
integers. There are homotopic deformations which makes that a line from one
family becomes close on a ﬁnite space region to a deformed line belonging to
other family. Then the presence of dissipation can allow for reconnection, which
produces a transition of the line from one family to another. This occurs in real
space-time. According to the conjecture, this transition is the manifestation in
real space-time of the existence of a solution connecting in extended space-time
solutions belonging to the two families. We have to look for this super solution.
To examine this example we simplify taking m = 1. Any solution represents
a section in a ﬁbred space whose base space is the circle (the axis of the torus)
and the space of internal symmetry (the ﬁbre) is also a circle (a phase variable,
represented by an arrow from the current point on basis to a point of a circle,
here the poloidal section). A conﬁguration (helical line) is a map

S1

S1

→
charaterized by an integer number n representing the degree of the map. This
means how many times a circle covers a circle, or, how many times the internal-
space phase variable θ varies between 0 and 2π for a single turn along the circle
representing the base space.

We will look for conﬁgurations allowing a transition between a line with (for

example) n = 1 to another line with n = 2.

First the model is extended to one where the homotopical deformations are
given by the time dynamics, a much more complex problem, where the simple
lines represent the instantaneous positions of the masses of a chain of pendulæ.
This is the sineGordon equation.

A. Extending the sine-Gordon equation to a larger sys-

tem

When we start from an ideal system (like Korteweg-deVries, sine-Gordon,
Nonlinear Schrodinger, Painlev´e transcendents, etc.) and try to look at it as a
reduced form of a larger and more complex system, it systematically appears
the Self-Dual Yang-Mills system.

It has been proved that all the equations mentioned above are reduced forms

of the SDYM equations. The derivation consists of several steps:

the ﬁbre bundle structure, where the basis is the space-time and the ﬁbre is

of the curvature two-form with its Hodge dual.

imposing the invariance to a group of symmetries. The generators of the
algebra of the symmetry group are constructed using the normal form of
the matrix that combines the basis vector ﬁelds in the projective coordi-
nates.

the connection one-form is contracted with these generators and particular
expressions are obtained. Requiring self-duality generates the nonlinear
equations

The abstract procedure can be expressed in the language of twistors.
After ﬁnding that the idealized form of the initial system can be seen as
a reduced form of the SDYM system, we can look for a suﬃciently general
framework for the SDYM : larger dimensionality, larger symmetry group, etc.
The aim is to reach the form of the theory where the solution connecting the
two topological structures is available. In this idea, the extension of the SDYM
system to the Hitchin system will prove to be essential for identiﬁng the passage
between the two S1
S1 states characterized by diﬀerent topological degrees
n as the Riemann surface representing interaction of two strings.

B. String theory realisation of the instanton as a Riemann

surface

Looking for systematic methods to construct instantons connecting conﬁgu-
rations with diﬀerent topologies, we must start with the cases where the initial
and ﬁnal states have the simplest nontrivial homology. These are essentially the
classes of states of a system representing the mapping ϕ

S1 ϕ
→
whose ﬁrst homotopy group is π1
S1
= Z. Such a system is the sine-Gordon
equation. The states are classiﬁed by the integer n and we ask how to connect,
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
for example, a state n with a state n′
= n. We can ﬁnd a suggestive algebraic-
geometric construction in the Matrix theory.

S1

In general terms the Matrix theory is the non-perturbative description of the
M -theory which, in turn, is the 11-dimensional theory of the strong coupling
limit of type IIA strings. The string theory can be obtained from the M -theory
by compactiﬁcation on a circle and identifying the string coupling constant with
the radius of this circle. By compactiﬁcation it results a supersymmetric Yang-
Mills theory (SYM) which describes non-perturbatively the type IIA strings.
The duality of these theories (strings and SYM) is underlined by the relation be-

√α′gSY M

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

tween their coupling constants gs =
and means that examining
the strong coupling limit of SYM we get the weakly interacting, i.e. perturba-
tive, limit of the string theory. In Ref.11 it is shown that the deep infrared limit
(equivalent to strong coupling in SYM) is a theory describing strings propa-
gating freely. The supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory oﬀers two models equally
interesting for their topological properties. In the absence of interaction (a phase
with completely broken U (N ) symmetry), the strings are multiply wound along
the compact dimension of the cylindrical base space. When a weak interaction is
allowed we have separation and connection of strings. At this point a Riemann
surface is introduced and this is the construction we want to examine. However,
in order to reach that point we have to say few words about the matrix theory.
Everything that follows can be found in the papers related to the M -theory, in
particular in Refs.,11,1213 , which we strongly recommend to be read for more
detailed explanation of this framework.

The starting point is the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 10 dimensions.
This is dimensionally reduced to two spatial dimensions yielding a SYM theory
with gauge group U (N ) deﬁned on the 1 + 1 dimensional Minkowski space, with
the action

For small gs the strings are weakly coupled. At the limit gs = 0 there is no
interaction and all matrices commute. In this case the matrices X’s and the
fermionic ﬁelds Θ can be written

X I = U xI U †

Θ = U θU †

where xI and θ are diagonal matrices and the matrix U is unitary.

1. Multiply wound strings

It is possible to ﬁnd ﬁeld conﬁgurations corresponding to strings multiply
wound around the compact direction σ. To make them more explicit we have
to take the matrix U of the form

which means

U (σ + 2π) = U (σ) g

x (σ + 2π) = gx (σ) g†

where g is an element of the Weyl group of the group U (N ). One can see
that the variation around the compact coordinate σ yields an interchange of
the eigenvalues which form cycles of diﬀerent lengths. Considering a cycle
of length n, it implies n eigenvalues x1 (σ, τ ), x2 (σ, τ ), ..., xn (σ, τ ) with the
cyclying property

xi (σ + 2π, τ ) = xi+1 (σ, τ ) et xn+1 = x1

In the infrared limit there are sectors corresponding to diﬀerent ways to

divide the total number of eigenvalues in cyclic groups

where Nn is the number of cycles of length (i.e. number of eigenvalues in the
cycle) n. For these sectors the original non-abelian symmetry is broken to the
discrete symmetric group SN , which has two consequences: (1) it permutes the
diﬀerent cycles of the same length n; and (2) it performs cyclic permutations
inside every cycle.

N =

nNn

Xn

9

The string interaction appears when two eigenvalues, as functions of (σ, τ ),
come close and are interchanged. In the point (σ, τ ) where they are touching
a group U (2) (a subgroup of the original gauge symmetry U (N ) which was
completely broken) is restored.

In conclusion the strings do not interact in the infrared limit, where the
gauge symmetry is completely broken down to the maximal torus U (1)r where
r is the rank of the gauge group.

2. String interaction

As we have said, leaving the infrared limit and allowing a weak interaction
it appears in the SYM theory that certain non-abelian subgroups are restored
in some region of the spae-time. This corresponds to the fact that, around a
particular point (σ, τ ) two eigenvalues of X become equal

xI = xJ

restoring a U (2) symmetry out of two U (1). This means that for a nonzero gs
it occurs a transition between states characterized by the transposition of these
two eigenvalues. This is an elementary process of separation or of connection of
two strings.

Let us start from the state where there are only free strings. This means
that the ﬁelds X I are diagonal having on the diagonal groups of eigenvalues
forming cycles of various lengths. The ﬁelds are

Aµ = 0

X (σ, τ ) = diag (x1 (σ, τ ) , ..., xn (σ, τ ))

with the cycling condition

xi (σ + 2π, τ ) = xi+1 (σ, τ )

The matrix X veriﬁes the “free” equation ∂µ∂µX = 0.
When we turn around the interaction point (σ, τ ) the eigenvalues are inter-

changed and the ﬁelds are gauge-transformed

X = U (σ, τ ) diag (x1 (σ, τ ) , ..., xn (σ, τ )) U † (σ, τ )

Aµ = igU † (∂µU ) , Aτ = 0

The ﬁelds now verify the non-abelian equations

We conclude that the presence of cycles, i.e. multiply wound strings is connected
to the existence of a non-nul pure gauge ﬁeld Aµ. On the basis cylinder we can

no cycles, i.e. all eigenvalues of X are distinct (cycles have length 1) then X
consists of a N distinct sheets covering of the complex z plane. When multiply
wound strings exists there are branching points of diﬀerent order placed in the
origin. The order of the branching is the length of the cycle and the length
of the string. The interactions arise when the branching points are diﬀerent
from the origin.

In simpliﬁed terms this is a generalized form of the ϕ4 theory or of the
model of a particle in a two well potential. Both models can be embedded into
this large framework and their equations can be derived by reduction from the
equations obtained from the action S. The states corresponding in the simple
models to mapping the circle onto the circle a ﬁxed n number of times can be
regarded as a cross section of the full ﬁeld X (σ, τ ) at the gs = 0 limit, although
the content of X can be vastly richer.

It has been proved above that to the solution X of the equations of motion
with weak interaction corresponds a Riemann surface. This allows to identify
the insanton with this surface and to identify the two topological conﬁgurations
of diﬀerent n ’s with multiply wound strings in the incomming and respectively
in the outgoing state of the string interaction.

C. Transitions between regimes

The example of the kink connecting in imaginary time the equilibrium po-
sitions of a classical particle in the two-well potential can be generalized. The
minima of the two-well potential is replaced, in general cases, by states with
stationary properties corresponding, for the idealized system, to families with
deﬁnite topological content. To the instanton connecting the two particle po-
sitions it corresponds in general a solution connecting these distinct families of
states.

u (x, t) = uω

lim
x→∞

u (x, t) = uω + 2π

where uω = 4 arctan (exp x). We can see this example as a particular form of
the general structure discussed above.

D. Other possible examples

Solitons as homoclinic curves and intermittency of the Nonlinear
schrodinger Equation. The intermittency in the case of weakly dissipative,
driven, Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation has been examined numerically.10 It
has been found that there are jumps between two kinds of solitonic solutions on
a periodic domain. This has been explained by the analogy between the soliton
and the homoclinic curve of the simple system like the pendulum, separating
two distinct types of behaviour: ﬁnite oscillations and free rotation.

Transitions have been identiﬁed between states of complex dynamics, for
systems like sine-Gordon. In some cases, fast changes of the systems between

13

states of diﬀerent symmetry patterns have been observed in experiments with
burning gas in porous media, oscillations in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions,
etc. Under the same perspective should be examined the models of the free-
force type, in particular the ABC ﬂow. They are known to exhibit intermittency
and also are known to have a self-dual structure.

VI. Discussion

There are many possible extensions and developments arising from this idea,
some of them being interesting challanges. For example, if this idea is proved
correct and a systematic technical procedure will be available, one of the most
important application will be the description of the reconnection of vortices in
ﬂuids and plasmas (and similar, of the magnetic structures in weakly resistive
plasmas). The approach proposed here naturally explains why the mere presence
of the resistivity is required in such systems and why its magnitude is less
important: most of the time the ﬂuid performs homotopic deformations and
from time to time rapid reconnection events changes the topological degree.
The amount of energy implied in this event is not signiﬁcant while the simple
presence of the resistivity is required if we want reconnections to be possible.

A challanging problem which is closely related to our model is the general-
ization of the Painlev´e criterion. It is clear that the singularities of an instanton
deﬁned in a much larger theory than the original system cannot be simply re-
duced to singularities in the complex plane and can possibly appear as singular-
ities of Riemann surfaces or as vanishing cycles. A precise connection between
the intagrability of a model and the singularity structure of the instanton would
represent a generalization of the Painlev´e theory.

Abstract

We introduce a three independent functions variational formalism
for stationary and non-stationary barotropic ﬂows. This is less than the
four variables which appear in the standard equations of ﬂuid dynamics
which are the velocity ﬁeld ~v and the density ρ. It will be shown how
in terms of our new variable the Euler and continuity equations can be
integrated in the stationary case.

Introduction

Variational principles for non-magnetic barotropic ﬂuid dynamics an Eu-
lerian variational principle are well known.
Initial attempts to formulate
Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics in terms of a variational principle, were described
by Herivel [1], Serrin [2], Lin [3]. However, the variational principles devel-
oped by the above authors were very cumbersome containing quite a few
”Lagrange multipliers” and ”potentials”. The range of the total number
of independent functions in the above formulations ranges from eleven to
seven which exceeds by many the four functions appearing in the Eulerian
and continuity equations of a barotropic ﬂow. And therefore did not have

any practical use or applications. Seliger & Whitham [4] have developed a
variational formalism which can be shown to depend on only four variables
for barotropic ﬂow. Lynden-Bell & Katz [5] have described a variational
principle in terms of two functions the load λ (to be described below) and
density ρ. However, their formalism contains an implicit deﬁnition for the
velocity ~v such that one is required to solve a partial diﬀerential equation in
order to obtain both ~v in terms of ρ and λ as well as its variations. Much
the same criticism holds for their general variational for non-barotropic ﬂows
[6]. In this paper we overcome this limitation by paying the price of adding
an additional single function. Our formalism will allow arbitrary variations
and the deﬁnition of ~v will be explicit. Furthermore, we will show that for
stationary ﬂows using somewhat diﬀerent three variational variables the Eu-
ler and continuity equations may be reduced to a single non-linear algebraic
equation for the density and thus can be integrated.

We anticipate applications for this study both for stability analysis of
known ﬂuid dynamics conﬁgurations and for designing eﬃcient numerical
schemes for integrating the equations of ﬂuid dynamics [7, 8, 9, 10].

The plan of this paper is as follows: We will review the basic equations of
Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics and give a somewhat diﬀerent derivation of Seliger
& Whitham’s variational principle. Then we will describe the three function
variational principle for non-stationary ﬂuid dynamics. Finally we will give
a diﬀerent variational principle for stationary ﬂuid dynamics and we will
show how in terms the new variational variables the stationary equations
of ﬂuid dynamics that is the stationary Euler and continuity equations can
be reduced to a solution of a single non-linear algebraic equation for the
density.

2 Variational principle of non-stationary ﬂuid dy-

namics

Barotropic Eulerian ﬂuids can be described in terms of four functions the
velocity ~v and density ρ. Those functions need to satisfy the continuity and
Euler equations:

”frozen” within the Eulerian ﬂow1.

A very simple variational principle for non-stationary ﬂuid dynamics
was described by Seliger & Whitham [4] and is brought here mainly for
completeness using a slightly diﬀerent derivation than the one appearing in
the original paper. This will serve as a starting point for the next section in
which we will show how the variational principle can be simpliﬁed further.

multipliers which were inserted in such a way that the variational principle
will yield the following equations:

Provided ρ is not null those are just the continuity equation (1) and the
conditions that β is comoving. Let us take an arbitrary variational derivative
of the above action with respect to ~v, this will result in:

2.1 Euler’s equations

We shall now show that a velocity ﬁeld given by equation (8), such that the
functions α, β, ν satisfy the corresponding equations (6,10,13) must satisfy

This proves that the Euler equations can be derived from the action given
in equation (5) and hence all the equations of ﬂuid dynamics can be derived
from the above action without restricting the variations in any way. Taking
the curl of equation (17) will lead to equation (3).

2.2 Simpliﬁed action

The reader of this paper might argue that the authors have introduced
unnecessary complications to the theory of ﬂuid dynamics by adding three
more functions α, β, ν to the standard set ~v, ρ. In the following we will show
that this is not so and the action given in equation (5) in a form suitable
for a pedagogic presentation can indeed be simpliﬁed. It is easy to show
that the Lagrangian density appearing in equation (5) can be written in the
form:

The only term containing ~v is
L~v, it can easily be seen that this term will
lead, after we nullify the variational derivative, to equation (8) but will oth-
erwise have no contribution to other variational derivatives. Notice that the
term
boundary contains only complete partial derivatives and thus can not
contribute to the equations although it can change the boundary conditions.
Hence we see that equations (6), equation (10) and equation (13) can be de-
in which ˆ~v replaces ~v in the relevant
rived using the Lagrangian density ˆ
L
equations. Furthermore, after integrating the four equations (6,10,13) we
can insert the potentials α, β, ν into equation (8) to obtain the physical ve-
locity ~v. Hence, the general barotropic ﬂuid dynamics problem is changed
such that instead of solving the four equations (1,2) we need to solve an
alternative set which can be derived from the Lagrangian density ˆ

2.3 The inverse problem

In the previous subsection we have shown that given a set of functions
α, β, ν satisfying the set of equations described in the previous subsections,
one can insert those functions into equation (8) and equation (14) to obtain
the physical velocity ~v and vorticity ~ω. In this subsection we will address
the inverse problem that is, suppose we are given the quantities ~v and ρ how
can one calculate the potentials α, β, ν? The treatment in this section will
follow closely (with minor changes) the discussion given by Lynden-Bell &
Katz [5] and is given here for completeness.

Consider a thin tube surrounding a vortex line as described in ﬁgure 1,
the vorticity ﬂux contained within the tube which is equal to the circulation
around the tube is:

Figure 1: A thin tube surrounding a vortex line

in which dl is a length element along the tube. Since the vortex lines move
with the ﬂow by virtue of equation (3) both the quantities ∆Φ and ∆M are
conserved and since the tube is thin we may deﬁne the conserved load:

in which the above integral is performed along the ﬁeld line. Obviously the
parts of the line which go out of the ﬂow to regions in which ρ = 0 has a null
contribution to the integral. Since λ is conserved is satisﬁes the equation:

By construction surfaces of constant load move with the ﬂow and contain
vortex lines. Hence the gradient to such surfaces must be orthogonal to the
ﬁeld line:

Now consider an arbitrary comoving point on the vortex line and donate
it by i, and consider an additional comoving point on the vortex line and
donate it by r. The integral:

is also a conserved quantity which we may denote following Lynden-Bell &
Katz [5] as the generalized metage. µ(i) is an arbitrary number which can
be chosen diﬀerently for each vortex line. By construction:

Also it is easy to see that by diﬀerentiating along the vortex line we obtain:

At this point we have two comoving coordinates of ﬂow, namely λ, µ obvi-
ously in a three dimensional ﬂow we also have a third coordinate. However,
before deﬁning the third coordinate we will ﬁnd it useful to work not directly
with λ but with a function of λ. Now consider the vortical ﬂux Φ(λ) within
a surface of constant load as described in ﬁgure 2 (the ﬁgure was given by
Lynden-Bell & Katz [5]). The ﬂux is a conserved quantity and depends only
on the load λ of the surrounding surface. Now we deﬁne the quantity:

Hence we have shown how α, β can be constructed for a known ~v, ρ. Notice
however, that β is deﬁned in a non unique way since one can redeﬁne β for
β +f (α) in which
example by performing the following transformation: β
f (α) is an arbitrary function. The comoving coordinates α, β serve as labels
of the vortex lines. Moreover the vortical ﬂux can be calculated as:

2.4 Stationary ﬂuid dynamics

Stationary ﬂows are a unique phenomena of Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics which
has no counter part in Lagrangian ﬂuid dynamics. The stationary ﬂow is
deﬁned by the fact that the physical ﬁelds ~v, ρ do not depend on the temporal
coordinate. This however does not imply that the stationary potentials
α, β, ν are all functions of spatial coordinates alone. Moreover, it can be
shown that choosing the potentials in such a way will lead to erroneous
results in the sense that the stationary equations of motion can not be
derived from the Lagrangian density ˆ
given in equation (19). However,
L
this problem can be amended easily as follows. Let us choose α, ν to depend
on the spatial coordinates alone. Let us choose β such that:

β = ¯β

in which ¯β is a function of the spatial coordinates. The Lagrangian density

3 A simpler variational principle of non-stationary

ﬂuid dynamics

Lynden-Bell & Katz [5] have shown that an Eulerian variational principle
for non-stationary ﬂuid dynamics can be given in terms of two functions the

(39)

density ρ and the non-magnetic load λ deﬁned in equation (22). However,
their velocity was given an implicit deﬁnition in terms of a partial diﬀeren-
tial equation and its variations was constrained to satisfy this equation. In
this section we will propose a three function variational principle in which
the variations of the functions are not constrained in any way, part of our
derivation will overlap the formalism of Lynden-Bell & Katz. The three vari-
ables will include the density ρ, the non-magnetic load λ and an additional
function to be deﬁned in the next subsection. This variational principle is
simpler than the Seliger & Whitham variational principle [4] which is given
in terms of four functions and is more convenient than the Lynden-Bell &
Katz [5] variational principle since the variations are not constrained.

3.1 Velocity representation

[ν]λ is the discontinuity of ν across a cut which is introduced on the λ
surface. Hence in order that circulation C(λ) on the load surfaces (and
hence everywhere) will not vanish ν must be multiple-valued. Following
Lamb [15, page 180, article 132, equation 1] we write ν in the form:

in terms of ¯ν the velocity is given as:

ν = C(λ)¯ν,

And the explicit dependence of the velocity ﬁeld ~v on the circulation along

Hence for ρ
= 0 both λ and θ are comoving. Comparing equation (8) to
equation (42) we see that α is analogue to θ and β is analogue to λ and
all those variables are comoving. Furthermore, the ν function in equation
(42) satisﬁes the same equation as the ν appearing in equation (8) which is
equation (57). It follows immediately without the need for any additional
calculations that ~v given in equation (42) satisﬁes Euler’s equations (2), the
proof for this is given in subsection 2.1 in which one should replace α with
θ and β with λ. Thus all the equations of ﬂuid dynamics can be derived
from the action (50) without restricting the variations in any way. The
reader should notice an important diﬀerence between the current and pre-
vious formalism. In the current formalism θ is a dependent variable deﬁned
by equation (44), while in the previous formalism the analogue quantity α
was an independent variational variable. Thus equation (63) should be con-
sidered as some what complicated second-order partial diﬀerential equation
(in the temporal coordinate t) for λ which should be solved simultaneously
with equation (57) and equation (1).

Notice that the term
thus can not contribute to the equations although it can change the bound-
ary conditions. Hence we see that equation (1), equation (57) and equation
(63) can be derived using the Lagrangian density ˆ
in which ~v is given in
L
terms of equation (45) in the relevant equations. Furthermore, after inte-
grating those three equations we can insert the potentials λ, ν into equation
(45) to obtain the physical velocity ~v. Hence, the general barotropic ﬂuid
dynamics problem is altered such that instead of solving the four equations
(1,2) we need to solve an alternative set of three equations which can be de-
rived from the Lagrangian density ˆ
. Notice that the speciﬁc choice of the
L
labelling of the λ surfaces is not important in the above Lagrangian density
> Λ(λ), without changing the Lagrangian functional
one can replace: λ
form. This means that only the shape of the λ surface is important not
their labelling. In group theoretic language this implies that the Lagrangian
is invariant under an inﬁnite symmetry group and hence should posses an
inﬁnite number of constants of motion. In terms of the Lamb type function
¯ν deﬁned in equation (48), the Lagrangian density given in equation (50)

3.4 Stationary ﬂuid dynamics

For stationary ﬂows we assume that both the density ρ and the load λ are
time independent. Hence the velocity ﬁeld given in equation (45) can be
written as:

thus the stationary ﬂow is parallel to the load surfaces. From the above
equation we see that in the stationary case ν can be written in the form:

in which f (λ, t) is an arbitrary function and ν0 is independent of the tem-
poral coordinate. Hence we can rewrite the velocity ~v as:

Inserting equation (67) and equation (68) into equation (57) will yield:

the arbitrary g(λ) function can be absorbed into ν0 and thus we rewrite
equation (67) in the form:

ν = ν0 −

ρ, λ and ν0. Admittedly those equations do not have a particularly simple
form, we will obtain a somewhat better set of equations in the next section.

4 Simpliﬁed variational principle for stationary ﬂuid

dynamics

In the previous sections we have shown that ﬂuid dynamics can be described
in terms of four ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations and in term of an action
principle from which those equations can be derived. An alternative deriva-
tion in terms of three diﬀerential equations one of which (equation (63)) is
second order has been introduced as well. Those formalisms were shown to
apply to both stationary and non-stationary ﬂuid dynamics. In the following
a diﬀerent three functions formalism for stationary ﬂuid dynamics is intro-
duced. In the suggested representation, the Euler and continuity equations
can be integrated leaving only an algebraic equation to solve.

Consider equation (13), for a stationary ﬂow it takes the form:

Hence ~v can take the form:

tion equation equation (1):

in which G′ = G

in equation (25) up to an arbitrary constant which can very between vortex
lines. Since the lines are labelled by their α′, ¯β′ values it follows that we
can add an arbitrary function of α′, ¯β′ to µ without eﬀecting its properties.

to derive the right hand equation we have used both equation (27) and
equation (14). Hence µ, α are both comoving and stationary. As for ¯β it
satisﬁes equation (38).

By vector multiplying ~v and ~ω and using equations (94,14) we obtain:

~v

(96)

this means that both ~v and ~ω lie on α surfaces and provide a vector basis
for this two dimensional surface.

4.1 The action principle

In the previous subsection we have shown that if the velocity ﬁeld ~v is given
by equation (94) than equation (1) is satisﬁed automatically for stationary
ﬂows. To complete the set of equations we will show how the Euler equations
(2) can be derived from the Lagrangian:

If one chooses an α and µ functions such that the above nonlinear equation
has a positive (or zero) solution for Π at every point in space than one
obtains a solution of both the Euler and continuity equations in which ~v is
given by equation (94) and ρ = +√Π. One should notice, however, that
α and µ are not arbitrary functions. α is a function of the load deﬁned in
equation (22) and thus according to equation (24) must satisfy the equation:

(117)

that is both the velocity and vorticity ﬁelds must lie on the alpha surfaces.
While for the velocity ~v this is assured by equation (94) this is not assured
for the vorticity. Furthermore, µ is not an arbitrary function it is a metage
function an thus must satisfy equation (27). Moreover, obtaining a solution
does not imply that the obtained solution is stable. Having said that we
notice that the technique requires only the solution of the algebraic equation
(116) and does involve solving any diﬀerential equations.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have reviewed Eulerian variational principles for non-
stationary barotropic ﬂuid dynamics and introduced a simpler three inde-
pendent functions variational formalisms for stationary and non-stationary
barotropic ﬂows. This is less than the four variables which appear in the
standard equations of ﬂuid dynamics which are the velocity ﬁeld ~v and the
density ρ. We have shown how in terms of our new variables the stationary
Euler and continuity equations can be integrated, such that the station-
ary Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics problem is reduced to a non-linear algebraic
equation for the density.

The problem of stability analysis and the description of numerical schemes
using the described variational principles exceed the scope of this paper. We
suspect that for achieving this we will need to add additional constants of
motion constraints to the action as was done by [16, 17] see also [18], hope-
fully this will be discussed in a future paper.

Abstract

We show theoretically that thermomechanical eﬀects in dye-doped nematic liquid crystals when

illuminated by laser beams, can become important and lead to molecular reorientation at intensities

substantially lower than that needed for optical Fr´eedericksz transition. We propose a 1D model

that assumes homogenous intensity distribution in the plane of the layer and is capable to describe

such a thermally induced threshold lowering. We consider a particular geometry, with a linearly

polarized light incident perpendicularly on a layer of homeotropically aligned dye-doped nematics.

INTRODUCTION

Optically induced temperature changes in liquid crystals are at the origin of interesting

nonlinear behaviors [1]. Indeed, due to the light absorption, thermal eﬀects can change the

physical properties of the liquid crystal, which in turn aﬀects the light propagation in the

medium. Among the examples of thermal eﬀects, we can distinguish between a direct change

of the refractive indices, often referred to as thermal indexing, and the variation with the

temperature of other physical parameters, such as the elastic constants, which may inﬂuence

the light propagation as well. In the latter case, thermal eﬀects might be responsible for

director reorientation, and are thus referred to as thermomechanical eﬀects.

Previously,

light-induced thermomechanical eﬀects have been largely investigated in

cholesteric liquid crystals, where these eﬀects were originally related with the absence of

the right-left symmetry [2]. Then it became clear that such eﬀects might also exist in sys-

tems which possesses this symmetry, such as the nematic liquid crystals (NLC). As was

shown in [3, 4], thermomechanical eﬀects do give a contribution to the director, heat and

Navier-Stokes equations. These thermomechanical terms are given by nonlinear combina-

tions with respect to temperature, director and velocity gradients and represent nonlinear

cross couplings between them. The ﬁrst question which arose is to suggest an experiment

for measuring the magnitude of thermomechanical coeﬃcients. Indeed, it is hardly possible

to ﬁnd a setup which leads to the contribution of one of the coeﬃcients only. Since for

uniformly aligned nematics no thermomechanical eﬀects are expected, the hybrid-oriented

nematics were used in the experiments [5, 6]. There, the hydrodynamic ﬂow appeared as

a result of the applied temperature gradient, which allowed to ﬁnd the magnitude for the

thermomechanical coeﬃcients. Laser induced thermomechanical eﬀects in dye-doped ne-

matics have been envisaged in preliminary experiments [7]. However, it was not possible

to derive a deﬁnitive conclusion due to the main diﬃculty of separating thermomechanical

contributions from the light-induced molecular torque. Another problem when performing

these experiments is that of avoiding to approach the nematic-isotropic transition, where

an enhancement of the nonlinear optical response of dye-doped nematics could take place

because of other eﬀects, such as the weakening of the anchoring [8].

Here, we study theoretically the thermomechanical eﬀects which occur in uniformly

aligned dye-doped nematic liquid crystals. This happens when the sample is illuminated

2

by a laser beam with a wavelength in the absorption band of the dye, which causes a sig-

niﬁcant heating of the liquid crystal layer. Note that the absorbtion is negligible for pure

nematics, so that thermomechanical eﬀects are signiﬁcant only for dye-doped nematics. In-

deed, in the presence of dye-doping thermal heating leads to an additional torque which acts

onto the director together with the light-induced torque. This additional torque will help

either to destabilize or stabilize the initial orientation which is determined by the ratio of the

thermomechanical coeﬃcients. We show that the additional torque might be strong enough

to induce the molecular reorientation well before the onset of the light-induced molecular

reorientation, the so called optical Fr´eedericksz transition (OFT) for pure liquid crystals

[9] and Janossy eﬀect for dye-doped liquid crystals [10, 11]. We account for the possible

decrease of the reorientation threshold by a 1D model that assumes homogenous intensity

distribution in the plane of the layer (the plane wave approximation) and includes the light

absorption into the hydrodynamic equations for the nematics.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

In dye-doped nematics, contrary to the pure ones, the OFT lowering might happen not

only because of the well known Janossy eﬀect [10, 11] but also because thermomechanical

eﬀects may add a signiﬁcant contribution.

Indeed, as a consequence of light absorption,

light propagation in dye-doped nematics causes signiﬁcant heating of the LC. When the

intensity of a beam is suﬃciently large and temperature gradient becomes nonzero, an

additional force acting on the director and additional terms in the stress tensor in Navier-

Stokes equation for the velocity appear due to thermomechanical eﬀect [3, 4]. The equation

for the velocity is coupled with the director equation, so any dynamical process that leads

to director reorientation will also induce ﬂow even in the absence of pressure gradients. It

should be noted that the terms which describe the thermomechanical eﬀects appear not only

in the director but also in Navier-Stokes equations. Thus, neglecting the velocity equations

and considering only the director equation may lead to misleading results, even though this

simpliﬁcation has been done for many studies in the context of light induced instabilities.

In our case, we considered the full problem with the velocity equations coupled to the

director reorientation equation. However, in order to calculate the shift of the OFT thresh-

old due to the thermomechanical eﬀect we employed another frequently used simpliﬁcation,

namely that all variables depend only on one coordinate, which is transversal to the plane

of the nematic layer (1D assumption). We thus considered a linearly-polarized plane wave

incident perpendicularly on a layer of a dye-doped nematic of thickness L that is sand-

wiched between two substrates of thickness d (see Fig. 1). The cell has initially homeotropic

alignment (with strong homeotropic anchoring at the boundaries) and is placed in a ther-

mostage with a temperature T0 on both sides. The light is polarized along the x-direction

and propagates along the positive z-axis.

A. Heat equation

For simplicity we also assumed that i) the attenuation of the light inside the nematic

is small [i.e. I(z)

I0, where I0 is the incident intensity]; ii) the transversal heat ﬂow

≃

occurring in the (x, y) plane is neglected, i.e. the temperature proﬁle depends only on z,

T = T (z). Since we deal with the plane-wave approximation the following 1D steady-state

heat conductivity equations in the nematic and substrates can be written (note that an

absorption takes place only inside the nematic):

where κ|| is the parallel component of the heat conductivity tensor of the nematic, κs is the

heat conductivity of the substrates and α⊥ is the absorption coeﬃcient for the ordinary light.

We then write the boundary conditions given by continuity conditions of the temperature

4

and the heat ﬂow at the substrate-nematic interfaces (z = 0 and z = L):

Ts1|z=0 = TN |z=0, κs∂zTs1|z=0 = κ||∂zTN |z=0
TN |z=L = Ts2|z=L, κ||∂zTN |z=L = κs∂zTs2|z=L.
In this simplest model the temperature proﬁle is linear inside the substrates and has a

(2)

(3)

parabolic form inside the nematic which is symmetric with respect to the center of the

layer z = L/2. The maximal temperature is at the center of the layer and the maximal

temperature diﬀerence inside the nematic is ∆Tmax = α⊥I0L2/(8κ||). The temperature

gradient inside the nematic can be written as

where ρ = I0/IF is the incident intensity normalized to the threshold intensity of the OFT

and c is the velocity of light in the vacuum.

It should be noted that the obtained solution (4) for the temperature proﬁle inside the

nematics is much simpler than in reality. The more complicated solution for Gaussian

incident beams has been derived in [13] from 2D heat equation which includes transversal

dependence. It turned out that for large Gaussian beams i.e. when the spot size w is much

larger than the thickness of the layer L, w

L, the maximum temperature rise, ∆Tmax,

≫
becomes proportional to the spot size. Such a behavior is not predicted by the 1D model and

is owing to the transversal heat ﬂow occurring in the plane of the layer. Nevertheless, the

realization of the plane wave approximation in the experiment is diﬃcult but not impossible

task. One of the way to proceed is to enlarge the Gaussian beam to a size which is much

larger than the medium working area (which is much stronger condition then w

L), so

≫

that the intensity can be considered uniform in the central part. Another possibility is that

of using the so-called ﬂat-top beams [14]. Both techniques are quite easily accessible and

allow to attain the threshold for OFT. Preliminary experiments are running at present in

our laboratory and will be reported elsewhere.

six Leslie coeﬃcients αi[15] and the thermomechanical tensor T T M

Then, the incompressibility condition (ρm is constant)

v = 0 and the no-slip boundary
|z=0,L = 0 immediately ensure that the z component of the velocity vanishes
v = (vx(z, t), vy(z, t), 0), so v is parallel to the plane of the layer. Moreover, all convective

derivatives v

vanish. The Navier-Stokes equation has been simpliﬁed then due to the

fact that the director relaxation time

and, thus, the inertial terms in the Eq. (6) can be neglected. Taking into account that the

light is polarized in the x-direction, we need an equation for the x component only. The

tensor with the thermomechanical coeﬃcient a10. (Note that a10 in [4] is related to the ξi

change of the director relative to the ﬂuid.

In Eq. (11) gT M is the contribution of the

thermomechanical eﬀect to the force acting on the director [3].

In Fig. 2 the results of numerical solution of Eq. (20) [or alternatively the eigenvalue

problem (17)] are shown for three diﬀerent cases when i) δ2 = δ1; ii) δ2 = 0; iii) δ2 =

(δ2 = 0 corresponds to the thermomechanical single-constant approximation.) One can see

from this ﬁgure that ρc might be indeed several times lower than that for the OFT. This

fact is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3 where the contour lines for the surface ρc(δ1, δ2) are

plotted. One is now forced to conclude that the thermomechanical eﬀect leads indeed to the

substantial change of the critical intensity.

E. Thermomechanical eﬀect due to temperature diﬀerence at the boundaries

We have assumed so far that the temperature on both the bounding plates is the same.

As a next step, we have analyzed the inﬂuence of the nonzero temperature diﬀerence ∆T

maintained at the boundaries to the instability threshold. To obtain this eﬀect in pure form

we assumed that the thermomechanical eﬀect is due to ∆T only and the absorption inside

nematic is neglected. For this simple situation the temperature gradient inside nematic is

constant. Following the similar procedure described in previous section when linearizing

basic equations around the homeotropic state [see Eq. (17)], the following ODE for nx has

and the other quantities have the same meaning as before. After substituting σ = 0 in

Eq. (21) the following simple formula for the critical intensity was found

As is seen ρc is always higher than the threshold for OFT and depends quadratically on

∆T . This eﬀect is, however, small because the thermomechanical coeﬃcient enters quadrat-

ically to the expression for ρc as well. (The order of magnitude of d3 is 10−2 ◦C −1 for the

parameters used in calculations.)

III. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have shown theoretically that thermomechanical eﬀects might be at the

origin of signiﬁcant lowering of the OFT threshold expected for dye-doped nematic liquid

crystals. To explain this, we have developed a simple model, assuming that all physical

quantities depend only on the coordinate across the layer. We linearize both the director

and Navier-Stokes equations around the basic state, to assess the change of the primary

instability due to thermomechanical eﬀects. The temperature gradient across the layer,

which is induced by light itself due to absorption of the dye dopants, was calculated from

the 1D heat equation. Using a typical value for the thermomechanical coeﬃcients, we have

found that the eﬀect of OFT’s lowering might be explained by thermomechanical eﬀects. We

have also analyzed a situation when the thermomechanical eﬀects are due to the temperature

diﬀerence maintained at the boundaries. It turned out that in this case they always lead to

an increase of the OFT threshold.

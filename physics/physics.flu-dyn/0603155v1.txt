Interaction of particles of dust with vortex convective ﬂows is under theoretical consideration. It
is assumed that the volume fraction of solid phase is small, variations of density due to nonuniform
distribution of particles and those caused by temperature nonisothermality of medium are compara-
ble. Equations for the description of thermal buoyancy convection of a dusty medium are developed
in the framework of the generalized Boussinesq approximation taking into account ﬁnite velocity
of particle sedimentation. The capture of a cloud of dust particles by a vortex convective ﬂow is
considered, general criterion for the formation of such a cloud is obtained. The peculiarities of a
steady state in the form of a dust cloud and backward inﬂuence of the solid phase on the carrier
ﬂow are studied in detail for a vertical layer heated from the sidewalls. It is shown that in the case,
when this backward inﬂuence is essential, a hysteresis behavior is possible. The stability analysis of
the steady state is performed. It turns out that there is a narrow range of governing parameters, in
which such a steady state is stable.

INTRODUCTION

Disperse systems, such as clouds of small particles sus-
pended in liquid or gas are widespread in natural environ-
ment as well as in various ﬁelds of human activity. Due
to admixture, such systems demonstrate intriguing phys-
ical eﬀects, which cannot occur in homogeneous media.
Understanding of the mechanisms governing the behav-
ior of particles in ﬂuid ﬂows is of crucial importance both
for fundamental studies and practical applications.

Advection of particles in ﬂuid ﬂows is currently in-
vestigated in several disciplines.
In chemistry (see, for
example, Refs. 1,2), this problem is essential in lower-
ing fuel consumption during combustion of liquid fuels.
In biology, recent developments have put forth a num-
ber of fascinating problems concerning transport of mi-
croorganisms in aqueous medium.3,4,5 A typical example
are algae, transported by ocean ﬂows. These algae con-
tribute essentially to the absorption of CO2 in oceans,
which is closely related to the problem of climate change.
In rapidly developing microﬂuidics, advection of particles
has been the focus of close attention due to a need of ﬁnd-
ing eﬀective mechanisms of particle mixing.6 In ﬂuid me-
chanics light-scattering particles of dust are widely used
for visualization of ﬂows. Besides, it is also important to
know how particles inﬂuence the ﬂow. Investigation of a
spread of ﬁne-dispersed impurities in the atmosphere and
oceans is tightly related to the problem of environmental
protection. These numerous applications have motivated
the unﬂagging interest in the fundamental problems of
particle advection in ﬂuids.

The behavior of a small single particle in isothermal
ﬂuid ﬂows has been the subject of a great deal of study
(see, for example, the monograph7 and the reviews8,9).
In particular, the equation of motion for a small single
particle in a nonuniform unsteady ﬂow was discussed by
Maxey and Riley.10 However, the fact that this equation
takes into account the integral Basset force essentially
complicates its solution. Therefore in most cases the
problem has been solved in terms of asymptotic theo-
retical models. Stommel11 studied sedimentation of par-
ticles in a cellular ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of weak inertia ap-
proximation. To our knowledge this was the ﬁrst paper
that developed a simple description of capture of small
solid particles by a ﬂuid ﬂow. It was shown, that when
the ascending ﬂow is rather intensive, some particles are
involved in a vortex motion and remain suspended. Re-
cently, capture of particles has been observed in a cel-
lular convective ﬂow.12 Qualitatively similar behavior is
shown by granular media in the ascending air ﬂow un-
der gravity: at a certain velocity of air ﬂow the granular
matter is liquidized.13 The problem of sedimentation of
small heavy particles has been generalized for the case
of a random ﬂow (see Ref. 14 and references therein).
However, a backward eﬀect of the particles on a ﬂuid
ﬂow was not considered. A number of theoretical and
experimental studies are devoted to the problem of par-
ticle accumulation in ﬂuid ﬂows – the eﬀect, which is
essential due to a diﬀerence in the inertial properties of
the phases when gravity is insigniﬁcant.15,16,17,18 The sit-
uation, when both gravity and inertia contribute to the
particle dynamics, has been studied in papers.19,20,21 The
authors of papers22,23,24,25,26,27 have investigated the in-
ﬂuence of the Basset history force on the particle motion.

Another problem that has been intensively studied
for many years is the stability of laminar isothermal
ﬂows carrying small solid particles. First papers28,29,30

were devoted to the stability of the particulate Poiseuille
ﬂow. This problem has been generalized in the series of
papers.31,32 The stability of the Couette ﬂow was consid-
ered in Ref. 33. A general result of these investigations
is that stability of a dusty ﬂow qualitatively depends on
the size of particles: relatively small particles destabilize
the ﬂow, whereas the particles of a larger size make the
ﬂow more stable. The relaxation time of small particles
is short, therefore such particles move actually with the
velocity of the ﬂuid. The presence of particles results in
renormalization of the media density. A larger eﬃcient
density is equivalent to a higher ﬂuid velocity, which leads
to destabilization. On the contrary, the relaxation time
of large particles is long. Such particles are too inert to
respond to rapid velocity variations of the carrying ﬂuid
and hence, large particles damp the ﬂuid velocity pertur-
bations.

The collective behavior of particles in laminar non-
isothermal ﬂows is much less studied. Moreover, the
problem of interaction of the particles with convective
ﬂows is not completely understood yet. The exceptions
are the works, concerning the inﬂuence of settling parti-
cles on the stability of convective ﬂows.34,35,36

It is known, that particles of dust are widely used for
visualization of ﬂows in the experiments on thermal buoy-
ancy convection. It is conventionally assumed that, if the
mass concentration of particles is small, their backward
inﬂuence on the convective ﬂow is negligible. However,
this is not always true. The point is that buoyancy con-
vective ﬂow itself is caused by small variations of density
related to nonisothermality of a medium. If density vari-
ations due to nonuniformity of the particle distribution
are of the same order of magnitude as those due to non-
isothermality, one should no longer ignore the inﬂuence
of particles on the ﬂow. For small particle concentration
this eﬀect is intuitively believed to be pronounced if the
density of particles and the density of the carrier ﬂuid
diﬀer enough. A typical example is solid particles sus-
pended in a gaseous medium. However, we argue below
that the eﬀect is essential in more general case, when the
densities of phases are diﬀerent, but of the same order
(for example, in liquids laden with small solid particles).
Under gravity such particles tend to settle on the bottom
of a container. Two mechanisms hinder particles from
settling down: the Brownian motion of particles leading
to their diﬀusion in a carrier ﬂuid and the entrapment of
particles by vortex ﬂuid ﬂows. The ﬁrst mechanism op-
erates also in a quiescent medium and leads to the Boltz-
mann distribution of particles over a height. However,
for particle sizes commonly used for ﬂow visualization,
an eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient is so small that in the
equilibrium state the particles are practically absent in
most part of the volume. The second mechanism, which
operates only if the maximal velocity of ascending ﬂows
exceeds the sedimentation velocity, is much more eﬃ-
cient. Investigation of the capture eﬀect and a backward
inﬂuence of the particles on a ﬂow is important not only
for visualization problems but also for more fundamental

2

aspects of environmental problems.

The mechanism of particle capture discussed above is
related to nonuniformity of the particle distribution over
the volume. Even if the initial distribution of particles
is uniform, this nonuniformity arises by itself due to the
particle sedimentation in the regions, where the ﬂow is
either descending or has small vertical velocities. If the
vertical dimension of the container is large, the particle
distribution in the most part of the container is nearly
uniform for a long time. However, even in this case the
particles can inﬂuence the ﬂow, because their velocity dif-
fers from the velocity of the ﬂuid due to sedimentation.
Thus, the particles can transfer the perturbations of tem-
perature and vorticity and aﬀect stability of a convective
ﬂow.34,35

In the present paper, we study the capture of dust par-
ticles by convective ﬂows. Particularly, a backward eﬀect
of particles on the ﬂuid ﬂow is investigated in details. In
Sec. II, an appropriate theoretical model is developed as a
generalization of the Boussinesq approximation to a con-
vective ﬂow in a dusty medium. In Sec. III, the obtained
equations are used to make a general interpretation of the
problem and to prove that the entrapped particles form
a cloud of dust. Section IV is devoted to consideration
of a dusty medium in an inﬁnite vertical layer. The exis-
tence of a steady state solution with particle distribution
in the form a dust cloud is proved, and the stability of
this state is investigated.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL OF THERMAL
BUOYANCY CONVECTION IN A DUSTY
MEDIUM

A. Governing equations and basic assumptions

Consider the behavior of small solid particles, sus-
pended in a nonisothermal ﬂuid (liquid or gas) under
gravity. On one hand, all particles are assumed to
be monodisperse spheres of a radius rp, which is large
enough to neglect particle diﬀusion. On the other hand,
this size is supposed to be much smaller than the char-
acteristic length scale L of the ﬂow. On a scale much
greater than rp the particles are regarded as a continu-
ous medium with the volume fraction ϕ = 4/3πr3
pn (the
ϕ), where
volume fraction of the ﬂuid phase µ = 1
n is the the number of particles per unit volume of the
medium. Since the actual volume concentration n is pro-
portional to ϕ and diﬀers from the latter by a constant
factor, in the following for the sake of simplicity ϕ will
be called concentration.

We suppose that the volume concentration of parti-
cles is small, so we can neglect interparticle interactions
and interactions between the particles and walls of a con-
It is also assumed that the carrier phase is in-
tainer.
compressible and the solid particles can neither deform
nor combine into agglomerates. Moreover, the density
of a solid phase is considered to be constant. The latter

assumption implies that we neglect thermal expansion of
the solid phase, which is perfectly valid in the dilute limit.
After averaging over space the equations for mass, mo-
mentum and energy balance of both phases are written
as follows:7,8,37

istic particle size to the ﬂow length scale rp/L, where κ
is the thermal conductivity of ﬂuid. We make a note of
the distinction between the two Lagrangian derivatives

In the approximation of undisturbed ﬂow these terms
coincide with the Archemedian force. Generally, the par-
ticle during its motion, disturbs the ﬂow, the eﬀect being
taken into account by the next three terms in (4): the
Stokes viscous drag, the Basset history force, caused by
unsteadiness of a viscous boundary layer around a parti-
cle, and the added mass force, allowing for the inertia of
the surrounding ﬂuid.

We do not consider the eﬀects that can be initiated by
rotation of particles. Particularly, the Magnus force is
not taken into account in (4). This assumption holds only
in the case when the particle response time 2r2
pδ/(9ν)
is much less than the characteristic hydrodynamic time
scale L2/ν. Therefore the Stokes number, corresponding
to a ratio of these time scales, is assumed to be small:

However, we assume the parameter δ to be ﬁnite and do
not restrict our theory to the limiting case of dusty media
(δ

into account Einstein’s correction term to the viscosity
of ﬂuid due to solid admixture, which is inessential in the
dilute limit.

The equation of state used here is typical for ther-
mal buoyancy convection. We consider weak convection,
when the variations of density due to nonisothermality
of a ﬂuid are small. Assuming that the ﬂuid density is
a function of only temperature ρ = ρ(T ), we expand it
into a Taylor series near its reference value ρ0 at the
temperature value T0 and restrict ourselves to a linear
approximation

B. Single-ﬂuid approximation

Let us consider a ﬂuid laden with small solid particles
and prove that the initial two-phase theoretical model
(1)-(4) can be simpliﬁed. We assume that the mass con-
centration of particles δϕ is comparable with the relative
variations of the ﬂuid density due to nonisothermality.
Bearing in mind that the particle concentration ϕ, the
nonisothermality βθ, and the relative size of particles
rp/L are small we retain only the leading terms in the
momentum equations (2). As a result we conclude that
in the basic state the pressure distribution is hydrostatic,
and obtain a relation between the velocities of phases:

imation we can state that at large values of the Galilei
number and small density inhomogeneities the density
of the medium will be constant everywhere except for
the buoyancy force, where these small density variations
are multiplied by Ga. So, we introduce the thermal
Grashof number Gr = βθGa and its concentration analog
Gc = (δ
1)ϕ0Ga, where ϕ0 is the characteristic value
of the particle concentration.

−

From the energy balance equation (3b) we obtain in the
leading order: Tp = T . We restrict our consideration to
this approximation. This implies that for small particles
the time to equilibrate the phase temperature is much less
than the viscous hydrodynamic time scale. The energy
equation for the ﬂuid phase is then obtained from Eqs.
(3).

Taking into account the mass balance equations for
ﬂuid and particles (1) we arrive at a complete set of
equations describing thermal buoyancy convection in a

The set of equations (8)-(11) is reminiscent of equa-
tions for thermosolutal convection. However, there are
two essential diﬀerences: ﬁrst, we have neglected the dif-
fusion of particles, second, we have taken into account
the ﬁnite sedimentation velocity. The developed model is
quite general and can be applied to dusty media, aerosols,
liquids laden with small solid particles, and biological
species in aqueous media.

III. CAPTURE OF DUST PARTICLES.
GENERAL CONSIDERATION

Consider the behavior of a dusty medium in a closed
cavity of an arbitrary shape heated from the sidewalls. It
is assumed that at the initial time the dust is uniformly
distributed all over the volume and at a later time no new
particles enter the cavity but the existing particles may
settle to the bottom. We also assume that the particles

4

that have settled on the bottom are not carried back into
the ﬂow, but stick to the bottom. The question arises as
to whether all particles should eventually settle on the
bottom or there may occur a situation when some parti-
cles will be entrapped by the ﬂow and stay in a suspended
state for inﬁnitely long time.

Obviously, in the absence of heating (Gr = 0) and
any initial perturbations, all particles will eventually sink
down on the bottom for a time of order 1/S, which corre-
sponds to the following solution of the equations (8)-(11):

u = 0,
T = 0,

ϕ =

0,
1,

z > Z(t)
z < Z(t)

where Z(t) = const
S t. So, initial distribution of par-
ticles ensures sedimentation without distortion of the in-
terface between a pure ﬂuid and suspension.

−

In order to simplify further argumentation, we will
measure z from the lowest point of the cavity. It can be
understood through insight that inducing of initial per-
turbations of concentration and velocity does not change
the situation: ﬁnally all perturbations will be damped
and all the particles will settle on the bottom. To demon-
strate this let us consider the evolution of the total energy
of the system E:

Since at all time moments t > 0 the value ϕ diﬀers from

n < 0 (i.e. at the bottom of a cavity), the right-hand
side of (13) is always nonpositive. Moreover it can be

FIG. 1: Streamlines of the particle ﬂow in the absence (a)
and in the case (b) of particle capture.

The total amount of the dust in the cavity decreases un-
til ϕ turns to zero everywhere near the boundaries. It
does not mean, however, that the bulk of the ﬂuid will
be completely free of particles.
If in some part of the
cavity the velocity of the ascending ﬂuid ua exceeds the
sedimentation velocity S, we can expect the capture of
the particles. The condition

ua > S

(15)

is the necessary condition for capture but it is not a suﬃ-
cient one. Indeed, we can easily imagine the ﬂow pattern
with the streamlines of particles shown in Fig. 1(a): de-
spite the existence of regions with ascending motion of
particles, all streamlines end at the lower boundary.

On the other hand, we can specify a suﬃcient condi-
tion for capture, which is probably not necessary. Let
us assume that there is the line, at which the horizon-
If on
tal component of the the ﬂuid velocity vanishes.
this line there is a point where ua = S then such a point
is a singular point for the vector ﬁeld up. Furthermore,
owing to (11) we have

div up = 0,

and therefore the vector ﬁeld up is free of sources or sinks.
In this case only two types of structurally stable ﬁxed
points are possible: center or saddle. In the case of the
center point, there are closed orbits, i.e. some particles
are entrapped by a vortex and stay inside for inﬁnitely
long time. The existence of the saddle point together
with the boundary conditions for up necessary implies
the existence of the closed separatrix loop and the center
point, as it is schematically presented in Fig. 1(b). The
separatrix loop forms the boundary of the captured cloud
of particles.

To demonstrate how formation of a cloud of dust oc-
curs, we have numerically integrated Eqs. (8)-(11) for a
partial case of the square cavity, heated from the right
side. The quiescent state with uniform distribution of
particles was chosen as the initial one. The values of gov-
erning parameters correspond to the single-vortex ﬂow,
satisfying the condition (15). This complementary exam-
ple is in agreement with the results of general considera-
tion. During evolution (see Fig. 2), a part of particles is

5

gradually leaving the ﬂow, whereas other particles stay
suspended. As a result of this transient process, the sys-
tem evolves to the steady state with a distribution of
particles in the form of a cloud.

The theory above describes the case of no particle in-
ertia.
In general, the trajectory of a captured particle
is no longer a closed orbit. Due to inertia the center
ﬁxed point [see Fig. 1(b)] transforms to a focus, which
is unstable for heavy particles.9 In the vicinity of the fo-
cus, captured particles of dust are repelled by this ﬁxed
point and move along spirals. Nonetheless, for small par-
ticles this eﬀect is weak. The addition to the velocity
of particle due to purely inertial drift uin
is given16,17

Recall, that we have also neglected the diﬀusion of the
particles, which means that our consideration concerns
the time scales less than the diﬀusion time scale td. How-
ever, this restriction is practically of no signiﬁcance. In-
deed, according to the Einstein formula, the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient of the spherical particles D = kT /(6πηrp) (here
T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann con-
stant). As before, for the ﬁne particles of dust in air at

responsible for formation of a cloud of dust and its back-
ward inﬂuence on the ﬂow hydrodynamics can be ob-
tained from a model problem. Let a dusty medium ﬁll

initial distribution of particles is uniform and look for a
steady state solution, in which the velocity has only ver-
tical component u0 and all ﬁelds except for the pressure
are independent of the vertical coordinate z. Then, the

In the case of the inﬁnite layer we should also specify

According to (17), (18), the temperature distribution
does not depend on the ﬂuid and particle motions and

Let us analyze velocity proﬁles of the ﬂuid and solid
phase. We start the discussion with the simplest case
Gc = 0, when the particles do not inﬂuence the ﬂuid
motion. In this case, the velocity proﬁle of the ﬂuid is
exactly the same as in the well-known problem on a con-
vective ﬂow of pure ﬂuid in a vertical layer heated from

As evident from Eq. (23) and the second condition in
(19), the parameter S is not independent; the width of the
cloud is determined by the ratio Gr0 = Gr/S, moreover,
the cloud exists only if Gr0 > 9√3. With the growth of
Gr0 the width of the cloud monotonically increases and
(see Fig. 3).
tends to 1 as Gr0 → ∞
At nonzero values of Gc the particles exercise an in-
ﬂuence on the ﬂuid ﬂow, and the dependence of the
characteristics of the cloud on the parameters becomes
more complex.
In this case the basic state is gov-
erned by Gr0 and a renormalized concentration parame-
ter Gc0 = Gc/S. In the presence of a particle cloud the

ﬂow region splits into three zones: 1)
x1 < x < x2, 3) x2 < x < 1.

As in the case discussed above, we assume that ϕ0 = 0
in the zones 1 and 3 and ϕ0 = 1 in the zone 2.

The cloud is absent if the velocity of ﬂuid is lower than
the velocity of sedimentation all over the volume. As in
the case of Gc0 = 0, this means that the cloud can exist
only at Gr0 > 9√3.

Let us discuss the dependence of the width of the par-
ticle cloud on the concentration parameter Gc0. At a
relatively low Gr0 the width of the cloud d monotoni-
cally decreases with the growth of Gc0 (see Fig. 4, line

1). This is related to the fact that the major part of the
cloud is located in the ascending ﬂow, hence, the larger
Gc0, the higher eﬀective density of the medium in this
place. The higher density leads to a decrease of the buoy-
ancy force and therefore to lowering of the ﬂow velocity.
The latter, in its turn, results in a decrease of the width
of the dust cloud, in which the particles can remain in
the suspended state.

At higher values of Gr0 the dependence of d on Gc0 be-
comes more complex. Generally, in this case the growth
of Gc also results in the decrease of the cloud width, but
now in some range of Gc0 the dependence d(Gc0) is no
longer unique (see Fig. 4, line 2). At low Gc0 the growth
of Gc0 only slightly inﬂuences the width of the cloud,
but starting from some threshold value of Gc0, the drag
force of the wide cloud becomes so strong that the ﬂow
is unable to keep it further. As a result, the width of
a cloud decreases by a jump.
If now, starting from a
large value of Gc0, we decrease it, ﬁrst, the cloud width
varies insigniﬁcantly, but then at some critical value of
concentration parameter the width of a cloud makes a
jump to nearly the highest possible value for a given Gr0.
Thus, the decrease of the cloud width with the change of
particle concentration demonstrates a well pronounced
hysteresis.

In Fig. 5 the proﬁles of the ﬂuid velocity at Gr0 = 500,
Gc0 = 600 are plotted for upper (line 1) and lower (line
2) branches of possible steady states. It is seen, that for
the upper branch the velocity proﬁle only slightly diﬀers
from the usual cubic proﬁle (21), but for the lower branch
the ﬂow in the domain occupied by the cloud is strongly
suppressed, the total intensity of the ﬂow is also low.

In Fig. 6 we plot a diagram deﬁning a range of hys-
teresis existence on the plane (Gc0, Gr0). The solid lines
divide the plane into two parts: larger and smaller ones.
Any point of the larger part corresponds to only one so-
lution (one root of a cloud width d at ﬁxed Gc0, Gr0),
whereas in the smaller one, the hysteresis zone, there are
three solutions (see Fig. 4). The solid lines, at which
there exist two solutions, correspond to folds; the point

d(Gc0) in Fig. 4, is structurally unstable.

B. 3.2. Linear stability analysis

1. Formulation of stability problem

Let us investigate the stability of the basic steady state.
We restrict our consideration to a ﬁxed value of the
Prandtl number Pr = 1, which corresponds to a typi-
cal case of particles, suspended in gaseous medium.

In order to formulate the stability problem, the govern-
ing equations (8)-(11) should be supplemented by neces-
sary conditions at the rigid boundaries of the layer and
continuity conditions at the borders of the dust cloud.
At the rigid walls of the layer we impose the no slip con-
dition for ﬂuid velocity, and the condition of constant
temperature:

x =

1 : u = 0, T =

±

1.

±

(28)

The borders of the dust cloud, which are the surfaces of
discontinuity for particle concentration, must satisfy the
conditions of stress balance, the continuity of velocity,
temperature, and energy ﬂux. These conditions are the
direct consequence of conservation laws for momentum,
energy, and mass. Assuming that the borders of a dust
cloud are deformable, the conditions at the interfaces are

x = x1,2 + ζ1,2 :

concentration surfaces from the ﬂat undisturbed shapes,
and square brackets are used to denote the jump of a

velocity of a particle at this point. Hence, for surface de-

disturbed ﬁelds u0 +v, p0 +q, T0 +ϑ, ϕ0 +φ into Eqs. (8)-
(11). Neglecting squared and higher order terms with re-
spect to perturbations, we obtain the equations for per-

v = 0, ϑ = 0.

Let us also assume the smallness of ζ1, ζ2. Then, the
equations (31)-(33), boundary conditions (34) and con-
ditions at deformable interfaces (29) reduced to those for
undisturbed interfaces admit a transformation, which is
analogous to the Squire transformation39 and discussed
below. Such a transformation allows us to reduce the full
three-dimensional problem to a problem in two dimen-
sions. We denote the x and z components of the velocity
v by u and w, respectively and analyze the stability of the
basic steady state with respect to the two-dimensional
perturbations in the form of transversal rolls. Thus, the
solution can be written as normal modes

The boundary value problem (36)-(42) is a spectral
amplitude problem. The conditions of nontrivial solution
deﬁne perturbation growth rate as a function of the pa-
rameters Gr, Pr, Gc, S and k. The solution with λr = 0
determines the neutral behavior and separates the re-
gions of unstable modes with λr > 0 from those of stable
modes with λr < 0.

In the particular case of Gc = 0, the particles have no
inﬂuence on the ﬂuid motion, and the boundary value
problem (36)-(42) reduces to the stability analysis38 of a
ﬂow with the odd velocity proﬁle (21). For Pr = 1, the in-
stability appears above the critical value Grmin = 496.3,
which is reached at kmin = 1.404, and corresponds to
the monotonic (i.e. to the solution with zero imaginary
part of the growth rate λi = 0) “hydrodynamic” pertur-
bations.

In the case of Gc

= 0, the problem admits analyt-
ical solution in the limit of short wavelength behavior
for a small, but ﬁnite width of the dust cloud.
In the
general case, the boundary value problem (36)-(42) was
treated numerically by the standard shooting and diﬀer-
ential sweep methods, which gave very close agreement
of the results.

2. Thin dust cloud, short wavelength limit

In the case of a thin cloud, the parameter d is small,
and the problem can be simpliﬁed. The nonlinear al-
gebraic equations (26), (27), deﬁning the width of the
cloud d and the coordinate of its center xc, can be solved
explicitly with the accuracy O

In the limit of vanishing cloud width, when d
obtain the lower threshold for the existence of a dust
cloud Gr = 9√3S, which is in agreement with the the
value obtained above for an arbitrary value of d.
It is
clearly seen from (25) that in this case the velocity proﬁle
coincides with (21). A thin cloud is located in the vicinity
of the point at which the ﬂuid velocity is maximal.

The short wavelength limit means that the wave num-

This particular case can be examined in the context of
the auxiliary problem, in which the layers of pure ﬂuid
are semi-inﬁnite and the dust cloud is in between these
layers and has the ﬁnite width 2d.
It is convenient to
treat the problem using the multi-scales technique.40 Let
us introduce the “fast” coordinate ξ = (x

The boundary value problem (44)-(50) is the inner one
with respect to the initial problem (36)-(42), which in its
turn should be referred to as an outer one. Generally,
the solutions of inner problem is matched to the outer
one. However, this should not necessary be done in the
present case since the solution of the inner problem (44)-
(50) proves to be vanishing at ξ =

The solution of the boundary value problem (44)-(50)
is quite cumbersome and is not adduced here. Actually,
the expressions for complex growth rates are of primary
interest.
In the zero order we obtain the trivial solu-
tion λ(0) = 0 and in higher orders we ﬁnd the nonzero
corrections to λ(0), corresponding (with accuracy up to
the small terms of higher order) to two diﬀerent types of
deformation of the dust cloud borders ˆζ1 =

One solution corresponds to deformation of the cloud
borders in the “phase,” when ˆζ1 = ˆζ2. This solution
is stable since the real part of the growth rate is nega-
tive. In the other solution, allowing for deformation of
the cloud borders in the “anti-phase,” when ˆζ1 =
ˆζ2,
the real part of the growth rate is positive, and hence
this solution is unstable. In both solutions the imaginary
part of the growth rate is nonzero suggesting that the
behavior of the system is oscillatory.

−

Note, that the obtained result is true for any nontrivial
values the parameters Gc and S. Thus, we conclude that
the dust cloud of a small, but ﬁnite width is unstable
with respect to short wavelength perturbations.

3. Dust cloud of an arbitrary width

Let us proceed to the discussion of general numerical
results, obtained for a cloud of arbitrary width d, and
consider the case S = 1.

The neutral curves for a ﬁxed value of the concentra-
tion parameter Gc = 100 are presented in Fig. 7. The
instability regions are above the curve 1 (between the
curve 1 and the line k = 0) and under the curve 2 (be-
tween the curves 2 and 3). Curve 3 is a straight line at
which Gr = 9√3S. This line deﬁnes the area of existence
of a dust cloud and corresponds to a dust cloud of zero
width. The cloud exists in the domain that is above this

line. As can be seen, there is a narrow range of values of
Gr, where the system is stable. The results (51), valid for
a thin cloud in the short wavelength limit, are in agree-
ment with those obtained from numerical solution to the
general boundary value problem (36)-(42). However, it is
obvious from Fig. 7, that the short wavelength instability
is not “the most dangerous”: although in some range of
governing parameters the ﬂow is stable with respect to
short waves, but yet for all possible values of the cloud
width d there exist unstable two-dimensional perturba-
tions in the form of transversal rolls with ﬁnite values of
k. It is interesting to note, that the steady state in the
case of a thin cloud is unstable with respect to perturba-
tions with any wave number k larger than some critical
value.

The global minimum of the curve 1 and the global
0 in Fig. 7 are char-
maximum of the curve 2 over k
acterized by the critical values of the Grashof number:
Grmin, Grmax, which are reached at the values of the
wave number kmin, kmax respectively. Let us discuss
the dependence of these critical parameters on the con-
centration parameter Gc. Figure 8 gives the stability
diagram on the plane (Gc, Gr). The stability region is
under the line 1 and above the line 2. Note, that the
curves 1 and 2 refer to the upper and the lower branches
of the dependence d (Gc), respectively (see Fig. 4). This
becomes important for distinguishing between stability
regions for the upper and lower branches in the hystere-
sis zone (Fig. 6), bounded by lines 4 and 5: the stability
region of the upper branch is deﬁned by the curve 1, for
the lower branch it is deﬁned by the curve 2. As before,
the line 3 is a line determining the region of a cloud of
vanishing width, at which Gr = 9√3S.

It should be noticed that the section of the straight line
Gc = 0, at 9√3 < Gr < 496.3 also refers to a stability
region. A piece of this line, corresponding to the values
Gr < 9√3 is stable as well, however, the basic steady
0
state in this case is completely free of particles, i.e. a dust

cloud is absent.

The variation of kmin, kmax with the concentration
parameter Gc is shown in Fig. 9. The imaginary parts
of growth rates corresponding to these solutions are
nonzero, which means that this “concentration” mode
is oscillatory. The hydrodynamic perturbations are not
the most dangerous for our particular value of sedimenta-
tion parameter S, their stability bound lies much higher
than the lines 1 and 2. Of special note is the dependence
kmin(Gc) at relatively small values of the concentration
parameter Gc. It is seen, that for not very large values of
Gc the wave number kmin is rather small, i.e. the system
demonstrates a nearly long wavelength behavior.

With the increase of the sedimentation parameter S the
region of hysteresis wedge shifts to the region of larger
values of Gr and Gc. Fig. 10 presents the stability dia-
gram for the case S = 5. The stability curves 1 and 2 do
not undergo any qualitative changes. However, in con-

trast to the case S = 1, the concentration mode is in com-
petition with the hydrodynamic mode: there appears the
range of values of Gc, at which the hydrodynamic per-
turbations (line 6) become the most dangerous for the
upper branch of the dependence d(Gc). With increase of
S this range grows, reducing the total stability region. In
the hysteresis zone line 6 sticks to the line 5: the upper
branch becomes unstable here. In comparison with the
case Gc = 0, the hydrodynamic mode is no longer mono-
tonic. Indeed, the monotonic character of hydrodynamic
perturbations is speciﬁed38 by the symmetry of the ve-
locity proﬁle u0. In our case, as it follows from (25), the
symmetry of u0 is broken at any value Gc

= 0.

4. Arbitrary three-dimensional perturbations

It was mentioned before,

that after linearization
Eqs. (31)-(33), boundary conditions (34) and the con-
ditions at the borders of the dust cloud (29) admit
a transformation, which is analogous to the Squire
transformation.39 Under
such a transformation the
Prandtl number Pr does not change, whereas the param-
eters Gr, Gc, and S transform according to the following
rule:

dimensional perturbations are the most dangerous.

Let us introduce the parameter, describing deviation
of arbitrary three-dimensional perturbations from the
two-dimensional perturbations in the form of transverse
rolls (35), namely the angle between the wave vector
k = (0, ky, kz), which generally lies in the plane y-z, and
the z-axis. If we denote the cosine of this angle by α,
then it follows from (52)

The greatest distinction of arbitrary three-dimensional
perturbations from transversal rolls (35) corresponds to
the limiting case of longitudinal rolls, when α = 0 (kz =
0, k
= 0). The perturbations of this kind are often called
the “helical” perturbations, since the trajectory of a ﬂuid
element in such a ﬂow looks like a helix. The motion
of a ﬂuid particle can be considered as a sum of two
diﬀerent forms of motion: ﬁrst, the particle moves circle-
wise inside the longitudinal roll, second, it is carried along
the roll with the velocity u0 + u.

Thus, at given α the diagram of stability with respect
to arbitrary three-dimensional perturbations can be ob-
tained from that of two-dimensional perturbations (35)
by rescaling Gr and Gc by a factor of 1/α. It is important
to note, that the parameter S is also transformed.

The linear stability analysis, performed with respect to
two-dimensional perturbations (35) for S from 1 up to 5,
allows us to investigate the inﬂuence of three-dimensional
perturbations with α in the range from 0.2 up to 1 for
S = 5. It turns out, that in this range the most dangerous
are the perturbations in the form of transversal rolls.

Further,

it can be explicitly shown, that the limit-
ing case of the longitudinal rolls (helical perturbations),
when α = 0 (kz = 0, k
= 0), does not cause instability.
Indeed, as it follows from Eqs. (31)-(34) and linearized
form of conditions (29), (30), this particular case is de-
scribed by the following boundary value problem (the
equations are the same for each of three zones):

ﬂuid, it cannot give birth to instability: the growth rate
is proved to be real and negatively deﬁned; the perturba-
tions monotonically decrease with time, and, therefore,
one should look for a mode with ˆv = 0. Hence, with
account of incompressibility relation (55), the boundary
conditions (58) for ˆu and continuity of this ﬁeld at the
points x1 and x2 we obtain ˆu = 0.

Since ˆu = 0, equation (57) corresponds to diﬀusion of ˆϑ
in motionless ﬂuid, and therefore, from analogous consid-
eration we conclude that perturbations decrease. Hence,
the mode with ˆϑ = 0 is to be found. As it follows from
the condition (59) for ˆζ1 and ˆζ2, the solution with λ
= 0
is possible only if ˆζ1 = 0 and ˆζ2 = 0. Consequently, ˆw
and its derivative are continuous at the points x1, x2, and
the problem for ˆw coincides with the problem for ˆϑ with
−1. Thus, for any values of govern-
the rescaled time t Pr
ing parameters the basic state is proved to be stable with
respect to perturbations in the form of longitudinal rolls.

The interaction of the vortex buoyancy convective ﬂow
laden with particles of dust has been investigated in the
case when the volume concentration of the solid phase is
small. Under these conditions the particles are partially
carried away by the ﬂow, but due to sedimentation their
velocity diﬀers from the velocity of a ﬂuid. At suﬃciently
intensive thermal convection some portion of the particles
can be captured by the ﬂow, which eventually results in
formation of a cloud of dust.

If mass concentration of the particles is rather small,
the particles do not inﬂuence the ﬂow and the study of
the formation of a dust cloud is reduced to a kinematic
problem. The size of the dust cloud captured by the con-
vective vortex monotonically increases with the growth of
the thermal Grashof number from some threshold value
Gr∗. At the values Gr < Gr∗, the formation of a steady
cloud is impossible: sooner or later all the particles set-
tle on the bottom of a cavity. This critical value of the
Grashof number is determined by the cavity shape and
thermal boundary conditions and is also proportional to

6

the sedimentation parameter S. The calculations for the
case of an inﬁnite vertical layer heated from the sidewalls
give Gr∗ = 9√3S.

With the increase of mass concentration of the parti-
cles their inﬂuence on the ﬂow becomes signiﬁcant. This
happens when relative variations of mass concentration
are comparable with the Boussinesq nonisothermality pa-
rameter βθ. Generally, the growth of mass concentration
results in the decrease of ﬂow intensity. Energy of the
ﬂow is partly consumed on the particle motion against
the gravity and on the motion of particles together with
the descending ﬂow. This energy is not returned to the
ﬂow completely because of the dissipative loss. The cal-
culations show that the interaction of the particles with
the convective ﬂow can lead to the hysteresis phenomena.
Diﬀerent ﬂow patterns can arise at the same values of the
governing parameters: the modes, in which a compara-
tively small dust cloud strongly suppresses the ascending
ﬂow and the modes developing at comparatively large
cloud when the density inhomogeneities are low and the
suppression eﬀect is insigniﬁcant.

The linear stability of the basic steady state in the form
of a dust cloud in an inﬁnite layer, heated from sidewalls,
has been investigated. It is shown, that in a relatively
narrow range of the values of governing parameters this
state is stable. Based on the results of the stability anal-
ysis, we can infer that in the typical case of a closed

13

cavity the steady state with a relatively large dust cloud
is most likely to have a larger range of stability. In the
case of an inﬁnite layer such a steady state is broken by
long wavelength perturbations. Obviously, such pertur-
bations cannot arise in a closed container of a ﬁnite size.
The performed investigation demonstrates that the de-
scribed eﬀects of two-way interaction of ﬂuid and parti-
cles can exist in natural environment or be realized ex-
perimentally. The values of the sedimentation parameter
S of order 1, used in the linear stability analysis, corre-
spond, for example, to the case of rather ﬁne particles
10−4 cm, suspended under gravity
of dust with rp
in a gaseous medium ﬁlling a laboratory-scale container
105). The
L
developed theory is quite general and can be applied to
describe similar eﬀects not only in dusty media, but also
in aerosols, liquids laden with small solid particles, and
biological species in aqueous media.

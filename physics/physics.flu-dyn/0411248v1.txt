Abstract

The problem of wave disturbance propagation in rareﬁed gas in gravity ﬁeld is
explored. The system of hydrodynamic-type equations for a stratiﬁed gas in gravity
ﬁeld is derived from BGK equation by method of piecewise continuous partition
function. The obtained system of the equations generalizes the Navier-Stokes at
arbitrary density (Knudsen numbers). The veriﬁcation of the model is made for a
limiting case of a homogeneous medium. Results are in the good agreement with
experiment and former theories at arbitrary Knudsen numbers.

Introduction

≪

There is a signiﬁcant number of problems of gas dynamics at which it is necessary to use
the mathematical apparatus beyond the limits of traditional hydrodynamics of Navier -
Stokes. The hydrodynamics is valid under the condition for the Knudsen number Kn =
l /L
1, where l is a mean free path, and L is a characteristic scale of inhomogeneity
of a problem under consideration. The ﬁrst work, in which wave perturbations of a gas
were investigated from the point of view of more general kinetic approach, perhaps, is the
paper of Wang of Chang and Uhlenbeck [1]. Most consistently these ideas are formulated
in the work of Foch and Ford [2]. Such general theory could be based on some kinetic
approach, i.e. Boltzman equation.

Numerous researches on a sound propagation in a homogeneous gas at arbitrary Knud-
sen numbers were made [4] - [12]. The investigations have shown, that at arbitrary Knud-
sen numbers the behaviour of a wave diﬀers considerably from ones predicted on a basis
of hydrodynamical equations of Navier - Stokes. These researches have revealed two es-
sential features: ﬁrst, propagating perturbations keep wave properties at larger values of
Kn, than it could be assumed on the basis of a hydrodynamical description. Secondly, at
Kn
1 such concepts as a wave vector and frequency of a wave become ill-determined.
≥
The case, when Knudsen number Kn is non-uniform in space or in time is more
diﬃcult for investigation and hence need more simpliﬁcations in kinetic equations or their
model analogues. A constructions of such approaches for analytical solutions based on
kinetic equation Bhatnagar – Gross – Krook (BGK) of Gross-Jackson [3] in a case of
exponentially stratiﬁed gas were considered at [28, 29]

In this paper we would develop and generalize the method of a piecewise continuous
partition functions [28, 29] to take into account the complete set of nonlinearities (?). We
consider the example of wave perturbations theory for a gas stratiﬁed in gravity ﬁeld so
that the Knudsen number exponentially depends on the (vertical) coordinate.

average thermal speed of movement of particles of gas, ν = ν0 exp(
z/H) is the eﬀective
frequency of collisions between particles of gas at height z. It is supposed, that density
of gas n, its average speed ~U = (ux, uy, uz) and temperature T are functions of time and
coordinates.

Following the idea of the method of piecewise continuous distribution functions let’s
search for the solution f of the equations (2) as combinations of two locally equilibrium
distribution functions, each of which gives the contribution in its own area of velocities
space:

here n±, U ±, T ± are parameters of locally equilibrium distributions functions. Geometry
of break, that is the area, in which various functions operate, is determined by geometry
of a problem.

Thus, a set of the parameters determining a state of the perturbed gas is increased
twice. The increase of the number of parameters of distribution function (2) results in
that the distribution function generally diﬀers from a local-equilibrium one and describes
deviations from hydrodynamical regime. In the range of small Knudsen numbers l << L
we have n+ = n−, U + = U −, T + = T − and distribution function (2) tends to local-
equilibrium one, reproducing exactly the hydrodynamics of Navier-Stokes. In the range
of big Knudsen numbers the formula (2) gives solutions of collisionless problems. Similar
ideas have resulted successfully in a series of problems. For example, in papers [18] - [20] a
method of piecewise continuous partition function was demonstrated for the description of
ﬂat and cylindrical (neutral and plasma) Kuette ﬂows [18] - [20]. Thus for a ﬂat problem
the surface of break in the velocity space was determined by a natural condition Vz = 0,
and in a cylindrical case Vr = 0, where Vz and Vr are, accordingly, vertical and radial
components of velocity of particles. Similar problem was solved by perturbations caused
by pulse movement of plane [20, 21]. Solving a problem of of a shock wave structure [20,
22, 23] the solution was represented as a combination of two locally equilibrium functions,
one of which determines the solution before front of a wave, and another - after. In the

2

problem of condensation/evaporation of drops of a given size [24, 25] a surface break was
determined by so-called ”cone of inﬂuence”, thus all particles were divided into two types:
ﬂying ”from a drop” and ﬂying ”not from a drop”.

The similar approach was developed for a description of a nonlinear sound in stratiﬁed

gas [26, 29].

The idea of a method of two-fold distribution functions given by (2) is realized as
follows. Let’s multiply equation BGK (1) on a set of linearly independent functions. In
the one-dimensional case ~U = (0, 0, Uz) the following set is used:

Here ρ is density, ρUz is speciﬁc momentum, e is internal energy per unit mass of the
gas, Pzz = P + πzz is the diagonal component of the strain tensor (P is pressure, πzz

parameter having meaning of a heat ﬂow.

The obtained system (6) of the equations according to the derivation scheme is valid at
all frequencies of collisions and within the limits of high frequencies should transform to
the hydrodynamic equations. It is a system of hydrodynamical type and generalizes the
classical equations of a viscous ﬂuid on any density, down to a free-molecule ﬂow. However,
the system (6) is not closed yet. It is necessary to add equations of state P = P (ρ, T )
and e = e(ρ, T ). Except for that it is necessary to present values of two integrals J1 and
J2 as functions of thermodynamic parameters of the system (6).

that do not coincide with the Prandtl number of ideal gas (Prid = 2/3). The wrong
Prandtl number is the main disadvantage of BGK model, that, however, can be removed
by changing to the more exact models of collision integral, for example, of Gross-Jackson

Lacks of the BGK model used in this article is that it gives correct value of viscosity
factor, but wrong value of coeﬃcient of heat conductivity. To the superior models of the
Gross - Jackson [3] this lack can be eliminated by transition.

At the solution of Boltzman equation the method of the Gross - Jackson revealed
sudden disappearance of discrete modes at some values rc ([6], [7], [9]), and with increase
of number of the moments rc decreased.

For example, Buckner and Ferziger in the paper [7] have shown, that for r > 1 the
solution is determined mainly by the discrete sound mode and the dispersion relation
may be used in calculating the sound parameters. For r < 1, the continuous modes are
important. The solution remains ”wavelike”, but it is no longer a classical plane wave. In
fact, the sound parameters are depend on the position of the receiver.

Below rc the solution is represented as superposition of a continuous spectrum of
eigen functions, therefore the classical understanding of a sound should be changed. The
concept of a dispersion relation is not applicable more.

6 Conclusion

The attenuation of sound at big Knudsen numbers is not ”damping”(due to intermolecular
collisions), but rather ”phase mixing”(due to molekules which left the oscillator at diﬀerent

10

phases arriving at the receiver at the same time)

The attenuation factor at big Knudsen numbers Kn > 1 is modelled by the account of
eﬀects of a relaxation in integral of collisions. The model of the Gross - Jackson at given
N limits an opportunity of the account external times of a relaxation (fast attenuation)
as essentially bases on a condition:

λi = λN +1,

i > N + 1

Supreme times of a relaxation are assumed identical. It means, that the inclusion of
N + 1 is necessary, that would allow to move in

the supreme eigen functions χi,
≥
the range of higher Knudsen numbers.

i

In piecewise continuous partition function method the number of waves is twice more,

but restrictions on attenuation factor remain.

Abstract

The interaction of a small vortex ring with the free surface of a perfect ﬂuid
is considered. In the frame of the point ring approximation the asymptotic
expression for the Fourier-components of radiated surface waves is obtained in
the case when the vortex ring comes from inﬁnity and has both horizontal and
vertical components of the velocity. The non-conservative corrections to the
equations of motion of the ring, due to Cherenkov radiation, are derived.

1 Introduction

The study of interaction between vortex structures in a ﬂuid and the free surface is
important both from practical and theoretical points of view. In general, a detailed
investigation of this problem is very hard. Even the theories of potential surface
waves and the dynamics of vortices in an inﬁnite space taken separately still have
a lot of unsolved fundamental problems on their own. Only the consideration of
signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed models can help us to understand the processes which take
place in the combined system.

In many cases it is possible to neglect the compressibility of the ﬂuid as well as
the energy dissipation. Therefore the model of ideal homogeneous incompressible
ﬂuid is very useful for hydrodynamics. Because of the conservative nature of this
model the application of the well developed apparatus of Hamiltonian dynamics be-
comes possible [1] [2]. An example of eﬀective use of the Hamiltonian formalism in
hydrodynamics is the introduction of canonical variables for investigations of poten-
tial ﬂows of perfect ﬂuids with a free boundary. V.E.Zakharov showed at the end
of the sixties [3] that the surface shape z = η(x, y, t) and the value of the velocity
potential ψ(x, y, t) on the surface can be considered as generalized coordinate and
momentum, respectively.

It is important to note that a variational formulation of Hamiltonian dynamics in
many cases allows to obtain good ﬁnite-dimensional approximations which reﬂect the
main features of the behavior of the original system. There are several possibilities
for a parameterization of non-potential ﬂows of perfect ﬂuid by some variables with
dynamics determined by a variational principle. All of them are based on the con-
servation of the topological characteristics of vortex lines in ideal ﬂuid ﬂows which
follows from the freezing-in of the vorticity ﬁeld Ω(r, t) = curl v(r, t). In particular,
this is the representation of the vorticity by Clebsch canonical variables λ and µ [4]
[2]

Ω(r, t) = [∇λ × ∇µ]

However, the Clebsch representation can only describe ﬂows with a trivial topology
(see, e.g., [5]). It cannot describe ﬂows with linked vortex lines. Besides, the variables
λ and µ are not suitable for the study of localized vortex structures like vortex
ﬁlaments. In such cases it is more convenient to use the parameterization of vorticity
in terms of vortex lines and consider the motion of these lines [6],[7], even if the global
deﬁnition of canonically conjugated variables is impossible due to topological reasons.
This approach is used in the present article to describe the interaction of deep (or
small) vortex rings of almost ideal shape in the perfect ﬂuid with the free surface. In
the case under consideration the main interaction of the vortex rings with the surface
can be described as the dipole-dipole interaction between ”point” vortex rings and
their ”images”. Moving rings interact with the surface waves, leading to radiation
due to the Cherenkov eﬀect. Deep rings disturb the surface weakly, so the inﬂuence
of the surface can be taken into account as some small corrections in the equations
of motion for the parameters of the rings.

In Sec.2 we discuss brieﬂy general properties of vortex line dynamics, which fol-
low from the freezing-in of the vorticity ﬁeld.
In Sec.3 possible simpliﬁcations of
the model are made and the point ring approximation is introduced. In Sec.4 the
interaction of the ring with its image is considered. In Sec.5 we calculate the Fourier-
components of Cherenkov surface waves radiated by a moving vortex ring and deter-
mine the non-conservative corrections caused by the interaction with the surface for
the vortex ring equations of motion.

2 Vortex lines motion in perfect ﬂuid

It is a well known fact that the freezing-in of the vorticity lines follows from the Euler
equation for ideal ﬂuid motion

Ωt = curl [v × Ω],

v = curl−1 Ω

Vortex lines are transported by the ﬂow [1],[4],[8]. They do not appear or disappear,
neither they intersect one another in the process of motion. This property of perfect
ﬂuid ﬂows is general for all Hamiltonian systems of the hydrodynamic type. For
simplicity, let us consider temporally the incompressible ﬂuid without free surface in
inﬁnite space. The dynamics of the system is speciﬁed by a basic Lagrangian L[v],
which is a functional of the solenoidal velocity ﬁeld. The relations between the ve-
locity v, the generalized vorticity Ω, the basic Lagrangian L[v] and the Hamiltonian

H[Ω] are the following [9]1

Ω = curl  δL
δv!
H[Ω] =  Z v · δL

⇒

v = v[Ω]

δv! d3r − L[v]!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=v[Ω]
δΩ!
v = curl  δH

and the equation of motion for the generalized vorticity is

Ωt = curl [curl (δH/δΩ) × Ω]

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

This equation corresponds to the transport of frozen-in vortex lines by the velocity
ﬁeld. In this process all topological invariants [10] of the vorticity ﬁeld are conserved.
The conservation of the topology can be expressed by the following relation [7]

Ω(r, t) = Z δ(r − R(a, t))(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)da =

(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)

detk∂R/∂ak

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=a(r,t)

where the mapping R(a, t) describes the deformation of lines of some initial solenoidal
ﬁeld Ω0(r). Here a(r, t) is the inverse mapping with respect to R(a, t). The direction
of the vector b

coincides with the direction of the vorticity ﬁeld at the point R(a, t). The equation
of motion for the mapping R(a, t) can be obtained with the help of the relation

b(a, t) = (Ω0(a)∇a)R(a, t)

(6)

Ωt(r, t) = curlrZ δ(r − R(a, t))[Rt(a, t) × b(a, t)]da,

1 For the ordinary ideal hydrodynamics in inﬁnite space the basic Lagrangian is

LEuler[v] =Z v2

dr

⇒

Ω = curl v

The Hamiltonian in this case coincides with the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid and in terms of the
vorticity ﬁeld it reads

HEuler[Ω] = −1/2Z Ω∆−1Ω dr =

1

8π ZZ Ω(r1) · Ω(r2)
|r1 − r2|

dr1dr2

where ∆−1 is the inverse Laplace operator.

Another example is the basic Lagrangian of Electron Magneto-hydrodynamics which takes into
account the magnetic ﬁeld created by the current of electron ﬂuid through the motionless ion ﬂuid.

⇒

Ω = curl(1 − ∆−1)v

8π ZZ e−|r1−r2|

Ω(r1) · Ω(r2)dr1dr2

The second example shows that the relation between the velocity and the vorticity can be more

complex than in usual hydrodynamics.

which immediately follows from Eq.(5). The substitution of Eq.(7) into the equation
of motion (4) gives [11]

curlr  b(a, t) × [Rt(a, t) − v(R, t)]

detk∂R/∂ak

! = 0

One can solve this equation by eliminating the curlr operator. Using the general
relationship between variational derivatives of some functional F [Ω]

"b × curl  δF

δΩ(R)!# =

δF

δR(a)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Ω0

it is possible to represent the equation of motion for R(a, t) as follows

(9)

[(Ω0(a)∇a)R(a) × Rt(a)] =

δH[Ω[R]]
δR(a)

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Ω0

It is not diﬃcult to check now that the dynamics of the vorticity ﬁeld with topological
properties deﬁned by Ω0 in the inﬁnite space is equivalent to the requirement of an

extremum of the action (δS = δR LΩ0dt = 0) where the Lagrangian is [7]
3 Z (cid:16) [Rt(a) × R(a)] · (Ω0(a)∇a)R(a)(cid:17)da − H[Ω[R]].

LΩ0 =

1

(10)

In the simplest case, when all vortex lines are closed it is possible to choose new
curvilinear coordinates ν1, ν2, ξ in a-space such that Eq.(5) can be written in a simple
form

Ω(r, t) = ZN

d2νI δ(r − R(ν, ξ, t))Rξdξ.

(11)

Here ν is the label of a line lying on a ﬁxed two-dimensional manifold N , and ξ
is some parameter along the line. It is clear that there is a gauge freedom in the
deﬁnition of ν and ξ. This freedom is connected with the possibility of changing the
longitudinal parameter ξ = ξ( ˜ξ, ν, t) and also with the relabeling of ν

ν = ν(˜ν, t),

∂(ν1, ν2)
∂(˜ν1, ˜ν2)

= 1.

(12)

Now we again consider the ordinary perfect ﬂuid with a free surface. To describe
the ﬂow entirely it is suﬃcient to specify the vorticity ﬁeld Ω(r, t) and the motion of
the free surface. Thus, we can use the shape R(ν, ξ, t) of the vortex lines as a new
dynamic object instead of Ω(r, t). It is important to note that in the presence of the
free surface the equations of motion for R(ν, ξ, t) follow from a variational principle
as in the case of inﬁnite space. It has been shown [12] that the Lagrangian for a
perfect ﬂuid, with vortices in its bulk and with a free surface, can be written in the
form

L =

1

3 ZN

d2νI ([Rt × R] · Rξ)dξ +Z Ψηtdr⊥ − H[R, Ψ, η].

(13)

The functions Ψ(r⊥, t) and η(r⊥, t) are the surface degrees of freedom for the system.
Ψ is the boundary value of total velocity potential, which includes the part from vor-
tices inside the ﬂuid, and η is the deviation of the surface from the horizontal plane.

This formulation supposes that vortex lines do not intersect the surface anywhere.
In the present paper only this case is considered.

expressed in terms of [R, Ψ, η].

The Hamiltonian H in Eq.(13) is nothing else than the total energy of the system
Variation with respect to R(ν, ξ, t) of the action deﬁned by the Lagrangian (13)

gives the equation of motion for vortex lines in the form

[Rξ × Rt] =

δH[Ω[R], Ψ, η]

δR

.

(14)

This equation determines only the transversal component of Rt which coincides with
the transversal component of the actual solenoidal velocity ﬁeld. The possibility of
solving Eq.(14) with respect to the time derivative Rt is closely connected with the
special gauge invariant nature of the H[R] dependence which results in

δH
δR · Rξ ≡ 0 .

The tangential component of Rt with respect to vorticity direction can be taken
arbitrary. This property is in accordance with the longitudinal gauge freedom. The
vorticity dynamics does not depend on the choice of the tangential component.

Generally speaking, only the local introduction of canonical variables for curve
dynamics is possible. For instance, a piece of the curve can be parameterized by one
of the three of Cartesian coordinates

R = (X(z, t), Y (z, t), z)

In this case the functions X(z, t) and Y (z, t) are canonically conjugated variables.
Another example is the parameterization in cylindrical coordinates, where variables
Z(θ, t) and (1/2)R2(θ, t) are canonically conjugated.

Curves with complicated topological properties need a general gauge free descrip-

tion by means of a parameter ξ.

It should be mentioned for clarity that the conservation of all vortex tube volumes,
reﬂecting the incompressibility of the ﬂuid, is not the constraint in this formalism. It
is a consequence of the symmetry of the Lagrangian (13) with respect to the relabel-
ing (12) ν → ˜ν [9]. Volume conservation follows from that symmetry in accordance
with Noether’s theorem. To prove this statement, we should consider such subset of
relabelings which forms a one-parameter group of transformations of the dynamical
variables. For small values of the group parameter, τ , the transformations are de-
termined by a function of two variables T (ν1, ν2) (with zero value on the boundary
∂N ) so that
R(ν1, ν2, ξ) → Rτ

IT = ZN

d2νI T (ν1, ν2)([R1 × R2] · Rξ)dξ = ZN

T (ν1, ν2)V(ν1, ν2, t)d2ν

(16)

where V(ν1, ν2, t)d2ν is the volume of an inﬁnitely thin vortex tube with cross-section
d2ν. It is obvious that actually the function V doesn’t depend on time t because the
function T (ν1, ν2) is arbitrary 2.

3 Point ring approximation

In general case an analysis of the dynamics deﬁned by the Lagrangian (13) is too
much complicated. We do not even have the exact expression for the Hamiltonian
H[R, Ψ, η] because it needs the explicit knowledge of the solution of the Laplace
equation with a boundary value assigned on a non-ﬂat surface. Another reason is
the very high nonlinearity of the problem.

In this paper we consider some limits where it is possible to simplify the system
signiﬁcantly. Namely, we will suppose that the vorticity is concentrated in several
very thin vortex rings of almost ideal shape. For a solitary ring the perfect shape is
stable for a wide range of vorticity distributions through the cross-section. This shape
provides an extremum of the energy for given values of the volumes of vortex tubes
and for a ﬁxed momentum of the ring. As already mentioned, volume conservation
follows from Noether’s theorem. Therefore some of these quantities (those of which
are produced by the subset of commuting transformations) can be considered as
canonical momenta. Corresponding cyclical coordinates describe the relabeling (12)
of the line markers, which doesn’t change the vorticity ﬁeld. Actually these degrees
of freedom take into account a rotation around the central line of the tube. This
line represents the mean shape of the ring and we are interested in how it behaves in
time. For our analysis we don’t need the explicit values of cyclical coordinates, but
only the conserved volumes as parameters in the Lagrangian.

A possible situation is when a typical time of the interaction with the surface and
with other rings is much larger then the largest period of oscillations corresponding
to deviations of the ring shape from perfect one. Under this condition, excitations
of all (non-cyclical) internal degrees of freedom are small during all the time, and a
variational anzats completely disregarding them reﬂects the behavior of the system
adequately. The circulations

Γn = ZNn

d2ν

of the velocity for each ring don’t depend on time. A perfect ring is described by the
coordinate Rn of the center and by the vector Pn = ΓnSn, where Sn is an oriented
area of the ring. We use in this work the Cartesian system of coordinates (x, y, z),
so that the vertical coordinate is z, and the unperturbed surface is at z = 0. The

2 If vortex lines are not closed but form a family of enclosed tori then the relabeling freedom is
less rich. In that case one can obtain by the similar way the conservation laws for volumes inside
closed vortex surfaces. Noether’s theorem gives integrals of motion which depend on an arbitrary
function of one variable S(ζ), where ζ is the label of the tori.

corresponding components of the vectors Rn and Pn are

Rn = (Xn, Yn, Zn),

Pn = (Pxn, Pyn, Pzn)

It is easy to verify that the vectors Pn are canonically conjugated momenta for the
coordinates Rn. To verify that we can parameterize the shape of each vortex line in
the following manner

R(ξ, t) =

M

Xm=−M

rm(t)eimξ,

r−m = ¯rm

(17)

Here rm(t) are complex vectors. Substituting this into the ﬁrst term of the La-
grangian (13) gives

1

3 I ([Rt × R]Rξ)dξ = 2πi˙r0([r−1 × r1] + 2[r−2 × r2] + . . .)+

+

d{...}
dt

+ 2πi˙r−1[r−1 × r2] − 2πi˙r1[r1 × r−2] + . . .

(18)

If we neglect the internal degrees of freedom which describe deviations of the ring
from the ideal shape

(r−1)2 = (r1)2 = 0,

r2 = r−2 = 0,

. . .

then the previous statement about canonically conjugated variables becomes obvious:

Rn = r0n,

Pn = 2πΓn · i[r−1n × r1n]

(19)

Such an approximation is valid only in the limit when sizes of rings are small in
comparison with the distances to the surface and the distances between diﬀerent
rings

s Pn
Γn ≪ |Zn|,|Rn − Rl|,

l 6= n.

(20)

These conditions are necessary for ensuring that the excitations of all internal degrees
of freedom are small. Obviously, this is not true when a ring approaches the surface.
In that case one should take into account also the internal degrees of freedom for the
vortex lines.

The inequalities (20) also imply that vortex rings in the limit under consideration
are similar to point magnet dipoles. This analogy is useful for calculation of the
Hamiltonian for interacting rings. In the main approximation we may restrict the
analysis by taking into account the dipole-dipole interaction only.

It should be mentioned that in some papers (see e.g. [14] and references in that
book) the discrete variables identical to Rn and Pn are derived in a diﬀerent way
and referred as the vortex magnetization variables.

In the expression for the Hamiltonian, several simpliﬁcations can be made. Let
us recall that for each moment of time it is possible to decompose the velocity ﬁeld
into two components

v = V0 + ∇φ.

7

(21)

Here the ﬁeld V0 satisﬁes the following conditions

(∇ · V0) = 0,

curlV0 = Ω,

(n · V0)|z=η = 0.

The boundary value of the surface wave potential φ(r) is ψ(r⊥). In accordance with
these conditions the kinetic energy is decomposed into two parts and the Hamiltonian
of the ﬂuid takes the form

H =

1

2 Zz<η

V2

0d3r +

1

2 Z ψ(∇φ · dS) +

g

2 Z η2dr⊥

(22)

The last term in this expression is the potential energy of the ﬂuid in the gravitational
ﬁeld. If all vortex rings are far away from the surface then its deviation from the
horizontal plane is small

|∇η| ≪ 1,

|η| ≪ |Zn|

(23)

Therefore in the main approximation the energy of dipoles interaction with the sur-
face can be described with the help of so called ”images”. The images are vortex
rings with parameters

Γn,

R∗
n = (Xn, Yn,−Zn),

P∗
n = (Pxn, Pyn,−Pzn)

(24)

The kinetic energy for the system of point rings and their images is the sum of the
self-energies of rings and the dipole-dipole interaction between them. The expres-
sion for the kinetic energy of small amplitude surface waves employs the operator
ˆk which multiplies Fourier-components of a function by the absolute value k of a
two-dimensional wave vector k. So the real Hamiltonian H is approximately equal
to the simpliﬁed Hamiltonian ˜H

(26)

where the small constant An is proportional to the conserved volume of the vortex
tube forming the ring. This expression can easily be derived if we take into account
that the main contribution to the energy is from the vicinity of the tube where
the velocity ﬁeld is approximately the same as near a straight vortex tube. The
logarithmic integral should then be taken between the limits from the thickness of
the tube to the radius of the ring.

Therefore the term V 2

Hamiltonian expansion.

4 Interaction of the vortex ring with its image

It is shown in the
Now let us for simplicity consider the case of a single ring.
next section, that for a suﬃciently deep ring the interaction with its image is much
stronger than the interaction with the surface waves. So it is interesting to examine
the motion of the ring neglecting the surface deviation.
In this case we have the
integrable Hamiltonian for the system with two degrees of freedom

(29)

so it is useful to consider the level lines of the energy function in the left (Z, Pz)-
half-plane taking Px as the parameter (see the Figure).

One can distinguish three regions of qualitatively diﬀerent behavior of the ring
in that part of this half-plane where our approximation is valid (see Eq.(20)). In
the upper region the phase trajectories come from inﬁnitely large negative Z where
they have a ﬁnite positive value of Pz. In the process of motion Pz increases. This
behavior corresponds to the case when the ring approaches the surface. Due to
the symmetry of the Hamiltonian (29) there is a symmetric lower region, where the
vortex ring moves away from the surface. And there is the middle region, where Pz
changes the sign from negative to positive at a ﬁnite value of Z. This is the region
of the ﬁnite motion.

In all three cases the track of the vortex ring bends toward the surface, i.e. the

ring is ”attracted” by the surface.

5 Cherenkov interaction of a vortex ring with sur-

face waves

When the ring is not very far from the surface and not very slow, the interaction
with the surface waves becomes signiﬁcant. Let us consider the eﬀect of Cherenkov
radiation of surface waves by a vortex ring which moves from the inﬁnity to the
surface. This case is the most deﬁnite from the viewpoint of initial conditions choice.
We suppose that the deviation of the free surface from the horizontal plane z = 0 is
zero at t → −∞, and we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of ﬁelds η and
ψ at large negative t. In this situation we can neglect the interaction of the ring
with its image in comparison with the self-energy and concentrate our attention on
interaction with surface waves only.

The ring moves in the (x, z)-plane with an almost constant velocity. In the main

approximation the position R of the vortex ring is given by the relations

R ≈ Ct,

for ψk(t) and ηk(t). Introducing the deﬁnition

of the ring parameters from these expressions. It is convenient to write down these

where Cx and Cz can be understood as explicit functions of P deﬁned by the de-
pendence C(P) = ∂E /∂P. More exact deﬁnition of Cx and Cz as ˙X and ˙Z is not
necessary.
To analyze the above integrals let us ﬁrst perform there the integration over the
angle ϕ in k-space.
It is convenient to use the theory of contour integrals in the
complex plane of variable w = cos ϕ. The contour γ of integration in our case goes
clockwise just around the cut which is from −1 to +1. We deﬁne the sign of the
square root R(w) = √1 − w2 so that its values are positive on the top side of the
cut and negative on the bottom side. After introducing the quantities

where the sign of the complex square root should be taken in accordance with the
previous choice. It can easily be seen that the integrals I2 and J1 have resonance
structure at a ≪ 1 and |b| < 1. This is the Cherenkov eﬀect itself. Now the

and Q = 2g|Z|/C 2
x is a dimensionless quantity 3. The Cherenkov eﬀect is most clear
when the motion of the ring is almost horizontal. In this case a → +0, and it is

Here the square root is the usual positive deﬁned real function. We see that only
resonant wave-numbers contribute to the functions F2 and G1, while F1 and G2 are
determined also by small values of ξ which correspond to the large scale surface
deviation co-moving with the ring. So the eﬀect of the Cherenkov radiation on the
vortex ring motion is the most distinct in the equations for ˙Z and ˙Px. Especially
it is important for Px because the radiation of surface waves is the only reason for
change of this quantity in the frame of our approximation.

The typical values of Q are large in practical situations. In this limit asymptotic

values of the integrals above are

It follows from these expressions that the interaction with the surface waves is small
in comparison with the interaction between ring and its image, if Q ≫ 1. The
corresponding small factors are 1/Q for X and Pz, and Q2+1/2 exp(−Q) for Z. As
against the ﬂat boundary, now Px is not conserved. It decreases exponentially slowly
and this is the main eﬀect of Cherenkov radiation.

We see also that the interaction with waves turns the vector P towards the surface

which results in a more fast boundary approach by the ring track.

6 Conclusions and acknowledgments

In this paper we have derived the simpliﬁed Lagrangian for the description of the
motion of deep vortex rings under free surface of perfect ﬂuid. We have analyzed the
integrable dynamics corresponding to the pure interaction of the single point vortex
ring with its image. It was found that there are three types of qualitatively diﬀerent
behaviour of the ring. The interaction of the ring with the surface has an attractive
character in all three regimes. The Fourier-components of radiated Cherenkov waves
were calculated for the case when the vortex ring comes from inﬁnity and has both
horizontal and vertical components of the velocity. The non-conservative corrections

14

to the equations of motion of the ring, due to Cherenkov radiation, were derived.
Due to these corrections the track of the ring bends towards the surface faster then
in the case of ﬂat surface. For simplicity, all calculations in Sec.5 were performed for
a single ring. The generalization for the case of many rings is straightforward.

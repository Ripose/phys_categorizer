Equilibrium Conﬁgurations of the Charged Surface of a

Conducting Liquid at a Finite Interelectrode Distance

The problem of determining equilibrium conﬁgurations of the free surface of a

conducting liquid is considered with allowance for a ﬁnite interelectrode distance.

The analogy is established between this electrostatic problem and that of ﬁnding the

proﬁle of a progressive capillary wave on the free surface of a liquid layer of a ﬁnite

depth, which was solved by Kinnersley. This analogy allowed exact solutions to be

obtained for the geometry of liquid electrodes, which expand the existing notions

about the possible stationary states of the system.

As is known, ﬂat surface of a conducting liquid exposed to a suﬃciently strong electric ﬁeld

becomes unstable [1]. This instability is induced by the Coulomb forces, whereas capillary

forces play a stabilizing role. In order to understand the main laws governing the behavior

of such systems, it is necessary to establish both the conditions under which the mutual

compensation of these forces is possible and the conditions where this is basically impossible.

This, in turn, makes necessary an analysis of the possible equilibrium conﬁgurations of the

charged surface of liquid electrodes.

Previously [2, 3], exact solutions were obtained for the equilibrium conﬁguration of the

surf ace of a conducting liquid in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld. In application to analysis

of the possible conﬁgurations of liquid electrodes, this situation corresponds to the formal

limit of inﬁnite interelectrode distances. The analysis in [2, 3] was based on the established

analogy with the problem of description of progressive capillary waves on the free surface

of a deep ideal liquid, which was solved by Crapper in 1957. The form of equations for

the two-dimensional potential of the electric ﬁeld and the hydrodynamic current function in

these problems coincide to within the notation.

This paper will demonstrate that, by expanding the aforementioned analogy to the case of

a ﬁnite distance between electrodes (and for capillary waves, to the case of a liquid layer of a

ﬁnite depth), it is possible to construct exact solutions of the classical electrostatic problem

for the case of ﬁnite geometry. The corresponding solutions for progressive capillary waves

were found in l976 by Kinnersley [4]; in 1999, these solutions were obtained using a more

rational method by Crowdy [5].

Now we will write a set of equations determining the equilibrium shape of the free surface

of a conducting liquid for a given interelectrode distance d and a potential diﬀerence U.

Let the vector of the electric ﬁeld strength to be directed along the y axis of a Cartesian

coordinate system. In the unperturbed state, the liquid boundary is a ﬂat horizontal surface

y =

d, and the position of the upper (ﬂat solid) electrode corresponds to y = 0. Restricting

−

the consideration to the case of planar symmetry, we can describe the shape of a perturbed

surface of the liquid electrode by the function η(x). For incompressible liquids, the periodic

which has to be solved together with the boundary conditions

The equilibrium relief of the liquid boundary is determined by the condition of balance of

the forces acting upon this surface:

where the ﬁrst term in the left-hand part describes the electrostatic pressure and the second

term, the surface pressure (α is the coeﬃcient of surface tension and p has a meaning of the

diﬀerence between the external and internal pressures).

Comparing the above equations to those [4] determining the shape of a capillary wave

in the system of coordinates moving at a phase velocity c with this wave, we establish that

these equations coincide to within the substitution

FIG. 1: One period of a stationary proﬁle of the free surface of a conducting liquid for k = 0.2

and u = 1.8. The curves show equipotential surfaces ϕ = 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5.

Here Ψ is a current function harmonically conjugated with the velocity potential and ρ is the

liquid density. Using the known symmetric solutions of these equations (which correspond

to case Ib in the notation of Kinnersley [4]), we obtain the following explicit parametric

expressions describing the electric ﬁeld strength distribution in the interelectrode gap:

acquires the value u =

equilibrium surface in the parametric form (ψ plays the role of a parameter).

It should be noted that the equilibrium conﬁgurations of a charged liquid were previously

studied only in a weakly nonlinear limit, whereby the wavelength was much greater than the

amplitude of the surface deformation (see, e.g. [6, 7, 8] and references therein). Using Eqs.

(1) and (2), it is possible to analyze (without allowance for the gravity ﬁeld) the possible

substantially nonlinear surface conﬁgurations for which the wavelengths and amplitudes are

comparable (see ﬁgure 1). Important distinction of such an analysis from that of Kinnersley

is the basically diﬀerent parametrization of solutions. In the hydrodynamic problem, the

main control parameter was the phase velocity; in our case, an analog of this velocity has

mo physical meaning. In the electrostatic problem, the control parameters are the potential

diﬀerence U and the interelectrode distance d. The latter quantity does not explicitly enter

into the expressions for solutions of Eqs. (1) and (2) and can be calculated using the formula

Excluding the moduli k, k′ and the pressure diﬀerence p from relations (3)-(5), we obtain

the dependence of the stationary wave amplitude A on the wavelength λ and the system

parameters (the potential diﬀerence U and the interelectrode distance d). Analysis of this

dependence, which is beyond the framework of this short communication, will allow us to

study qualitatively the obtained solutions with respect to their stability and to formulate

criteria for the growth of perturbations on the charged surface of liquid electrodes.

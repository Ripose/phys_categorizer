(February 2, 2008)

A statistical method for calculating equilibrium solutions of the shallow water equations, a model of
essentially 2-d ﬂuid ﬂow with a free surface, is described. The model contains a competing acoustic
turbulent direct energy cascade, and a 2-d turbulent inverse energy cascade. It is shown, nonetheless
that, just as in the corresponding theory of the inviscid Euler equation, the inﬁnite number of
conserved quantities constrain the ﬂow suﬃciently to produce nontrivial large-scale vortex structures
which are solutions to a set of explicitly derived coupled nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations.

The evolution of a ﬂuid from a strongly random initial
condition is generally characterized by one or more tur-
bulent cascades of energy to larger and/or smaller scales.
Whether energy ﬂows to smaller scales via a direct cas-
cade, or to larger scales via an inverse cascade, is deter-
mined by a combination of conservation laws and phase
space considerations. Generally, if only energy is con-
served [1] (as for 3-d Navier-Stokes turbulence [2]), its
ﬂow in phase space will be globally unconstrained and
will spread out to arbitrarily high wavenumbers, even-
tually draining all energy out of any large-scale macro-
scopic ﬂows initially present. Perhaps the most famil-
iar example of this is the thermodynamic equilibration
of a container of gas to a macroscopically featureless ﬁ-
nal state in which all energy eventually ends up as heat,
i.e., microscopic molecular motion. If, however, one or
more additional conservation laws are present (as for 2-d
Navier-Stokes turbulence [2], or for deep water surface
gravity wave turbulence [3]) their multiple enforcement
will generally not permit both conserved quantities to es-
cape to small scales, and macroscopic structure, whose
proﬁle will be initial condition and boundary condition
dependent, will survive. An example is the equilibration
to a rigidly rotating ﬁnal state of a gas in a cylindrical
container with frictionless walls. The additional conser-
vation of angular momentum along the axis of the cylin-
der precludes a featureless ﬁnal state.

A long-standing problem has been the characteriza-
tion of ﬁnal states of systems with an inﬁnite number of
conservation laws [4]. Diﬀerent values of the conserved
quantities should then produce an inﬁnite dimensional
space of ﬁnal states [5]. The example of the equilibrat-
ing gas motivates one to postulate that the macroscopic
ﬁnal state, be it featureless or not, should be thermody-
namic in character, i.e., it should be an equilibrium state
computable from the appropriate Hamiltonian using the
formalism of statistical mechanics. In [6] this approach
was used to produce a full characterization of the equi-
librium states of the 2-d incompressible Euler equation
(the inviscid limit of the 2-d Navier-Stokes equation) [7],
where the conserved quantities are the standard integrals

of all powers of the vorticity. The equilibria were found
to be characterized by a macroscopic steady state vor-
ticity distribution ω0(r) obeying an explicit “mean ﬁeld”
partial diﬀerential equation whose input parameters were
determined by the values of the conserved quantities.

The 2-d Euler equation is the simplest of these systems
in the sense that the incompressibility constraint ∇·v = 0
reduces the dynamics to that of the single scalar vorticity
ﬁeld ω = ∇ × v ≡ ∂xvy − ∂yvx, and the conservation laws
then provide an inﬁnite sequence of global constraints on
its evolution. In this work we study a more complicated
system of equations, the shallow water equations, an ex-
tension of the 2-d Euler equation that includes a free
surface with height ﬁeld h(r) coupled to gravity g. The
horizontal velocity v now becomes compressible (with 3-
d incompressibility enforced via vz = −z∇ · v) but is
assumed to be independent of the vertical coordinate z.
The eﬀective 2-d dynamical equations are:

Dv
Dt

≡ ∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −g∇h

∂th + ∇ · (hv) = 0,

(1)

(2)

The ﬁrst equation expresses the fact that the ﬂuid ac-
celerates in response to gradients in the surface height,
and the second enforces mass conservation, i.e., the full
3-d incompressibility. The Euler equation is recovered
formally when g → ∞ since height ﬂuctuations are then
suppressed. It is straightforward to verify that the ratio
Ω ≡ ω/h is convectively conserved, DΩ/Dt ≡ 0, imply-
ing conservation of all integrals of the form

Cf = Z d2rh(r)f [Ω(r)]

(3)

for any function f (s). These may be fully characterized
by the function g(σ), −∞ < σ < ∞, obtained from (3)
with f (s) = δ(σ − s), and g(σ)dσ therefore represents
the 3-d volume on which σ ≤ Ω ≤ σ + dσ. For general

f one then recovers Cf = R dσf (σ)g(σ). Note that if

ω ≡ 0 initially, then it must remain zero for all time.
Initial conditions of this type then generate (nonlinear,
in general) wave motions only [9].

1

The extension of the equilibrium theory to the shallow
water equations is a signiﬁcant advance because in addi-
tion to the usual vortical motions they contain acoustic
wave motions [8]. The latter are known [10] to have a
direct cascade of wave energy to small scales. One then
has the very interesting situation in which there are two
competing energy cascades, and the question arises as to
which one “wins.” In particular, is it possible that the
macroscopic vortex structures can “radiate” wave energy
and disappear entirely? We will show that under reason-
able physical assumptions a ﬁnite fraction of the energy
remains in large scale vortex structures, and we will de-
rive exact mean ﬁeld equations for the equilibrium struc-
ture.

The statistical formalism proceeds in a sequence of well
deﬁned steps. First, the Hamiltonian corresponding to
(1) and (2) is

H =

1

2 Z d2r(hv2 + gh2),

(4)

though the Poisson bracket yielding (1) and (2) from (4)
is noncanonical [4]. Second, the partition function is de-
ﬁned as an integral over the phase space of ﬁelds h, v with
an appropriate statistical measure. This so-called invari-
ant measure is most easily computed if the dynamics can
be expressed in terms of a set of variables, canonical vari-
ables being an example, for which a Liouville theorem is
satisﬁed. In this case invariant measures are any function
of the conserved integrals, with diﬀerent choices corre-
sponding to diﬀerent ensembles. In the Euler case [6] the
ﬁeld ω itself satisﬁes a Liouville theorem.
In the shal-
low water case no obvious combination of h, v or their
derivatives meet this requirement.

To circumvent this problem we transform to a La-
grangian description, in terms of interacting inﬁnitessi-
mal parcels of ﬂuid of equal 3-d volume, for which canon-
ical variables are easy to construct. Thus, let a be a 2-d
labeling of the system, and let r(a, t) be the position of
the parcel of ﬂuid such that, e.g., r(a, 0) = a. Since
all parcels have equal mass, the conjugate momentum is
p(a, t) = ˙r(a, t) = v(r(a, t), t). The height ﬁeld is simply
the Jacobian of the transformation between r and a:

h0/h(r(a)) = det(∂r/∂a) = ∂a1 r2 − ∂a2 r1,

(5)

where h0 is the overall mean height. The Hamiltonian
(4) now takes the form

H =

h0

2 Z d2a[p(a)2 + gh(a)],

(6)

while,

ω(a) ≡ ∇ × v = h(∂a2 r1∂a1p1 − ∂a1r1∂a2 p1

+ ∂a2 r2∂a1p2 − ∂a1r2∂a2 p2)

q(a) ≡ ∇ · v = h(∂a2r2∂a1 p1 − ∂a1 r2∂a2 p1

+ ∂a2 r1∂a1p2 − ∂a1r1∂a2 p2).

(7)

It is easily veriﬁed that the Lagrangian forms of (1)
and (2) follow from the Hamiltonian equations of motion
˙r(a) = δH/δp(a) and ˙p(a) = −δH/δr(a). The Liou-
ville theorem, which is a statement of incompressibility
of ﬂows in phase space,

Xα Z d2a[δ ˙rα(a)/δrα(a) + δ ˙pα(a)/δpα(a)]
= Z d2a[δ2H/δrα(a)δpα(a) − δ2H/δpα(a)δrα(a)] = 0,

(8)

statistical measure is ρ(H, {g(σ)})Qa d2r(a)d2p(a).

then follows immediately and implies that the correct
In
the grand canonical ensemble, which we shall adopt, the
function ρ is given by ρ = e−βK, where β = 1/T is a
hydrodynamic “temperature” and

K = H −Z dσµ(σ)g(σ)
= H −Z d2rh(r)µ[ω(r)/h(r)]
= H − h0Z d2aµ[ω(a)/h(a)]

(9)

in which µ(σ) is a chemical potential that couples to each
level ω(r)/h(r) = σ. The partition function is now de-
ﬁned by

Z[β, {µ(σ)}] =

1

N ! Ya

Z d2r(a)Z d2p(a)e−βK,

(10)

where N → ∞ is the number of ﬂuid parcels and N ! is
the usual classical delabeling factor. The thermodynamic
averages of the conserved quantities are now obtained
in the usual fashion as derivatives with respect to the
chemical potentials, hg(σ)i = T δ ln(Z)/δµ(σ).

One would now like to transform the integration in
(10) back to physical Eulerian variables. The key ob-
servation is that, from (7), Ω ≡ ω/h and Q ≡ q/h are
linear in p. Therefore, one may formally invert this re-

lationship to obtain Qa d2p(a) = Qa dQ(a)dΩ(a)J[h],

where, due to the particle relabeling symmetry (both
∇ · v and ∇ × v depend only on r and are then clearly
invariant under any permutation of the labels a), the Ja-
cobian J is a functional of the height ﬁeld h(a) alone.
The exact form of J will turn out to be unimportant.

Similarly, (1/N !)QaR d2r(a) = QaR dh(a)I[h], where

I[h] is another Jacobian. The 1/N ! factor precisely re-
moves the relabeling symmetry that, in particular, leaves
the height ﬁeld invariant. Finally, we replace the la-
bel a by the actual position r, in which the equal vol-
ume restriction on each ﬂuid parcel implies that the in-
ﬁnitesimal area of each parcel must be determined by
dV = h(r)d2r = constant. Thus:

1

N ! Ya Z d2r(a)Z d2p(a)

= Yr

Z dh(r)J [h]Z dΩ(r)Z dQ(r),

(11)

2

in which J [h] = I[h]J[h], and the mesh over which the
label r runs is nonuniform and changes with each real-
ization of the height ﬁeld h.

The statistical operator K must also be expressed in
terms of Q, Ω, h. Only for the kinetic energy T =

R d2rhv2 does this require some nontrivial manipula-

tions. Let the current j ≡ hv be decomposed in the
form j = ∇ × ψ − ∇φ. One obtains then

hQ (cid:19) = (cid:18) ∇ × 1
(cid:18) hΩ

∇ · 1

h ∇× −∇ × 1
h ∇× −∇ · 1

h ∇

h ∇ (cid:19)(cid:18) ψ

φ (cid:19) .

(12)

The 2 × 2 matrix operator, which we shall denote Lh,
appearing on the right hand side of (12) is self adjoint
and positive deﬁnite, and therefore possesses an inverse,
i.e., a 2 × 2 matrix Green function Gh(r, r′) satisfying
LhGh(r, r′) = 11δ(r − r′). An explicit form for Gh will not
be needed. The kinetic energy is then T = 1

R d2rh(ψΩ + φQ), i.e.,
T = Z d2rh(r)Z d2r′h(r′)(cid:18) Ω(r)

2 R d2rj · v =
Q(r) (cid:19) Gh(r, r′)(cid:18) Ω(r′)
Q(r′) (cid:19)

and the complete statistical operator is

K = T +Z d2rh(r)(cid:26) 1

2

gh(r) − µ[Ω(r)](cid:27)

(13)

(14)

The appearance of the factors h(r) and h(r′) is crucial
here because, as discussed above, dV = h(r)d2r and
dV ′ = h(r′)d2r′ are both uniform for each given statisti-
cal mesh.

We ﬁnally come to the evaluation of the partition func-
tion itself. This is accomplished with the use of the
Kac-Hubbard-Stratanovich (KHS) transformation, which
in discrete form reads for any positive deﬁnite matrix A,

where yi and ζi may be vectors, and the normalization

is N = pdet(2πA). This identity follows by completing

the square on the right hand side and performing the re-
maining Gaussian integral. We apply it to the discretized
version of (10) and (11) with ﬁnite dV , and the identiﬁca-
tions Aij = −β−1G(ri, ri) [11], yi = βdV [Ω(xi), Φi(xi)]
and we introduce the notation ζi = [Ψ(xi), Φ(xi)]. The
continuum limit dV → 0 will be taken at the end. The
partition function is now

(17)

in which [Lh]ij is an appropriate discretization of the
diﬀerential operator Lh. Notice that the inverse of Gh has
led to the reappearance of the local diﬀerential operator
Lh.

At the expense, then of introducing the new ﬁelds Ψ,
Φ we have succeeded in producing a purely local action
in which the integration over Ωi, Qi can be performed in-
dependently for each i (for given ﬁxed ﬁeld h). However,
we now arrive at a problem whose physical origin, as we
shall see, lies precisely in the direct cascade of wave en-
ergy. Thus, the chemical potential function µ(σ) controls
convergence of the Laplace transform-type integral

e

dΩie− ¯β[ΩiΨi−µ(Ωi)],

(18)

where ¯β ≡ βdV corresponds to a rescaled hydrodynamic
temperature ¯T = T dV which is assumed to remain ﬁnite
as dV → 0—the object of this choice is to obtain the cor-
rect control parameter for nontrivial hydrodynamic equi-
libria in the continuum limit that, as we shall see, yields
a nontrivial balance between energy and entropy contri-
butions to the ﬁnal free energy [6]. However, there is
no corresponding chemical potential controlling Qi and
the corresponding integral does not converge. Recall-
ing that Q = (1/h)∇ · v, unboundedness of Q reﬂects
unboundedness of small-scale gradients in the compres-
sional part of v and in h [12]. Thus, taken literally, the
direct cascade of wave energy leads to arbitrarily small
scale ﬂuctuations of the ﬂuid surface that remain of ﬁxed
amplitude, i.e., a kind of foam of ﬁxed thickness. Physi-
cally, of course, such small scale motions are rapidly dissi-
pated by processes that violate the approximations used
to derive the shallow water equations, e.g., by some com-
bination of viscosity and wave breaking [13]. This leads
to the following physically motivated assumption: dissi-
pative processes that suppress wave motions lead to the

interpretation R dQi exp( ¯βQiΦi) → δ( ¯βΦi), i.e., to the

vanishing of Φi.

With Φi ≡ 0, only the (1, 1) component of Lh con-
tributes, and in the continuum limit dV → 0 the parti-
tion function becomes

Z = Yr

(19)

(20)

The key observation now is that β = ¯β/dV → ∞ in the
continuum limit. Thus, mean ﬁeld theory becomes ex-
act and equilibrium solutions are given by extrema of F .

3

This is why the integration over the ﬁeld h(r), with its
unknown Jacobian, is ultimately irrelevant. The under-
lying assumption is only that the Jacobian is smooth, or
at least less singular than e−βF , in the neighborhood of
the extremum in the continuum limit.

The extremum conditions δF /δΨ(x) = 0 = δF /δh(x)

yield then the mean ﬁeld equations

∇ ·(cid:20) 1

∇Ψ(cid:21) = h(r)W ′[Ψ(r)]
h(r)
[∇Ψ(r)]2
2h(r)2 = W [Ψ(r)] − gh(r),

(21)

(22)

By adding a source term R d2rh(r)τ (r)Ω(r) to K, which

serves only to replace Ψ by Ψ−τ inside W , one may com-
pute the equilibrium average hΩ(r)i = [δF /δτ (r)]τ ≡0 =
−h−1∇ · (h−1∇Ψ). It follows then that hji = ∇ × Ψ, so
that Ψ is the stream function associated with the equi-
librium current. Equation (21) is in fact equivalent to
Ω = −W ′(Ψ), which guarantees that this is a true equi-
librium solution satisfying ˙Ω = 0, and equation (22) is
equivalent to Bernoulli’s theorem since it can be rewrit-
ten as (1/2)v2 + gh = W (Ψ).

As a simple example,

in the case where Ω = σ0
over half the 3-d volume of the ﬂuid and Ω = 0 on
the other half, the chemical potential takes the form
e ¯βµ(σ) = e ¯βµ0 δ(σ) + e ¯βµ1 δ(σ − σ0), and therefore by (18)
e ¯βW (s) = e ¯βµ0 + e ¯β(µ1−σ0s). Extensive numerical solu-
tions for the Euler equilibria exist for this “two-level”
system as a function of β and µ1 − µ0. [6,7].
In pre-
liminary numerical work, we ﬁnd that the shallow water
equilibria generated by (22) have very similar structure
(with, for example, vorticity moving from the walls to-
ward the center of the system as β decreases from positive
to negative values), while the height ﬁeld basically co-
varies with the vorticity in order to maintain hydrostatic
balance. Details of this work will be presented elsewhere.
The techniques presented in this paper can be used to
generate equilibrium equations for a number of other sys-
tems with an inﬁnite number of conserved integrals [4].
The key insight presented here is that whenever such a
system contains simultaneous direct and inverse energy
cascades, the long time dynamics becomes very singular
and additional physically motivated assumptions must
be made in order to derive sensible equilibria. Our as-
sumption, that dissipation acts to suppress the forward
cascading degrees of freedom with negligible eﬀect on the
macroscopic state, presumably depends on the smooth-
ness of the initial condition. Comparisons with detailed
numerical simulations will be required to evaluate such
eﬀects.

Note added: After completion of this work we be-
came aware of an e-print [14] where equations equivalent
to (22) are derived from a phenomenological maximum
entropy theory. No statistical mechanical derivation is
given, nor is the interaction between wave and vortical
motions and the eﬀects of waves on equilibration dis-
cussed.

[1] Real ﬂuids are always viscous, but models of turbulence
generally concern themselves with the “inertial range”
where loss of energy due to viscous damping is small com-
pared to that due to the cascade process, and an energy
conserving model is appropriate.

Rep. 123, 1 (1985).

[5] Study of these states is partly motivated by the con-
straints they place on simulations of turbulent ﬂow, e.g.,
the degree to which they properly preserve the conserva-
tion laws.

[7] The statistical approach relies on the assumption of er-
godicity of the dynamics. This assumption has been ex-
plored numerically with mixed results: depending upon
the initial condition, the dynamics may get stuck in
metastable equilibria. See, e.g., Pei-Long Chen Ph. D
Thesis, Caltech (1996); D. Z. Jinn and D. H. E. Dubin,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 4434 (1998).

[8] The linearized versions of these equations, ∂tv = −g∇η,
where η = h − h0 with h0 the mean surface height, and
∂tη + h0∇ · v = 0, have longitudinal traveling wave solu-
tions η = η0ei(k·r−c|k|t), v = η0(c/h0)ˆkei(k·r−c|k|t), with
speed c = √gh0. These waves become coupled through
the nonlinear terms as the amplitude η0 increases.

tions ∂tφ = g(h − h0) + 1

[9] If ω ≡ 0 then v = −∇φ leads to the pair of scalar equa-
2|∇φ|2, ∂th = ∇ · (h∇φ).
[10] See, e.g., A. Balk, Phys. Lett. A 187, 302 (1994).
[11] Note that β < 0 is required for positive deﬁniteness of A,
i.e., hydrodynamic equilibria often correspond to negative
temperature states. This is explained in detail in [6]. If
β > 0 one uses the the KHS transformation with ζi → iζi.
[12] Divergences in these gradients may in fact occur in ﬁnite
time since the shallow water equations are believed to
produce shock wave solutions. Appropriate continuation
of the equations nevertheless allows the conservation of
ω/h to be maintained even the presence of shocks (D. D.
Holm, private communication).

[13] Dissipation processes also act on the vortex structures,
but the conservation laws guarantee that microscopic
ﬂuctuations in Ω, unlike Q, remain ﬁnite and hence will
be dissipated much less strongly.

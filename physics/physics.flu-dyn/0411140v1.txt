The dynamics of the development of instability of the free surface of liquid helium,

which is charged by electrons localized above it, is studied. It is shown that, if the

charge completely screens the electric ﬁeld above the surface and its magnitude is

much larger then the instability threshold, the asymptotic behavior of the system can

be described by the well-known 3D Laplacian growth equations. The integrability

of these equations in 2D geometry makes it possible to described the evolution of

the surface up to the formation of singularities, viz., cuspidal point at which the

electric ﬁeld strength, the velocity of the liquid, and the curvature of its surface

assume inﬁnitely large values. The exact solutions obtained for the problem of the

electrocapillary wave proﬁle at the boundary of liquid helium indicate the tendency

to a charge in the surface topology as a result of formation of charged bubbles.

INTRODUCTION

2

It is well known [1, 2] that the liquid helium surface may be charged to high values of

the surface density of a negative electric charge. This is due to the fact that, on the one

hand, electrons are attracted to the surface by weak electrostatic image forces and, on the

other hand, the liquid helium boundary is a potential barrier for electrons, which prevents

their penetration in the bulk. An important feature of liquid helium as a dielectric with a

low polarizability is the relative weakness of the image forces, as a result of which the mean

distance between localized electrons and the surface is much larger than the atomic spacing.

Consequently, the electrons are not bound to individual atoms of the substance and form a

two-dimensional conducting system.

The ability of electrons to move freely over the surface of liquid helium ensures the

equipotential nature of this surface over characteristic hydrodynamic times and scales. A

charged surface of a conducting liquid also possesses this property, the only diﬀerence being

that the electric ﬁeld cannot penetrate into a conducting medium, while liquid helium is

not subjected to such a limitation. This enabled Gor’kov and Chernikova [3, 4] to extend

a number of classical results from the theory of instability of a liquid metal surface in

an external electric ﬁeld [5, 6, 7] to the case of the charged boundary of liquid helium

(the geometry of the system is shown schematically in Fig.1). For example, a natural

generalization of the dispersion relation for linear waves on the surface of a conducting

liquid is the following dispersion relation for liquid helium:

ω2 = gk +

k3

α
ρ

E2 + E′2
4πρ

−

k2,

(1)

where ω is the frequency, k is the wave number, g is the acceleration due to gravity, α is the
surface tension, ρ is the density of the medium, and E′ and E are the electric ﬁeld strengths

above the liquid and in the bulk of it, respectively (E = 0 for a conducting medium). It

follows hence that for

E′2 + E2 < Ec

2 = 8π√gαρ

the inequality ω2 > 0 holds for any k and, hence, small perturbations of the surface do not
build up with time. In the case when the sum of the squares of the ﬁelds E′2 + E2, which
2, a region

plays the role of an extrinsic controlling parameter, exceeds the critical value Ec

of wave numbers k for which ω2 < 0 is formed. This corresponds to an aperiodic instability

3

of the liquid boundary.

The buildup of perturbations of the surface inevitably transforms the system to a state

in which its evolution is determined by nonlinear processes. The nature of their eﬀect

can be estimated most easily in the vicinity of the instability threshold, i.e., for a small
supercriticality ε = (E2 + E′2

2, when only perturbations with wave numbers

2)/Ec

Ec

−

close to k0 =

gρ/α increase and we can pass to envelopes in the equations of motion.

For example, Gor’kov and Chernikova [8] proved that, in the case of 2D symmetry of the

p

problem, the complex amplitude A(x, t) of perturbation of the surface obeys the nonlinear

Klein-Gordon equation

(cid:1)

where S = (E2

E′2)/Ec

2 is the dimensionless parameter characterizing the surface charge

−

density.

It can be seen from Eq. (2) that, depending on the value of parameter S, the

nonlinearity either saturates the instability, or, conversely, facilitates a burst of the pertur-

bation amplitude. A similar conclusion can also be drawn in the general (3D) case with a

correction taking into account the fact that the nonlinearity in the ﬁrst nonvanishing order

plays a destabilizing role due to the interaction of three waves forming the hexagonal struc-

ture. As in 2D case, cubic nonlinearities produce a stabilizing eﬀect for small values of S
[9, 10]. Consequently, for a low surface charge density (when the values of E and E′ are

close), a steady-state relief of the liquid helium boundary may be formed. In this case, the

standard perturbation theory in the small parameter, viz., the characteristic slope of the

surface, can be used for studying the structures being generated (see [11] and the literature

cited therein).

The processes occurring in the supercritcal region of electric ﬁelds and for relatively

large electron surface charge screening the ﬁeld above the liquid surface to a considerable

extent have not been investigated in detail theoretically. This is due to the fact that,

in these cases, the development of instability violates the small-angle approximation. For

example, the analysis of the behavior of the charged boundary of liquid helium by high-speed
microphotography carried out by Vololdin et al. [12] proved that the dimples appearing on

the surface are sharpened over a ﬁnite time (the bubbles which are subsequently formed at

the tips carry the charge from the helium surface to the positive plate of the capacitor).

In view of the considerable nonlinearity of such processes, their description requires the

4

construction of solutions to the fundamental equations of the electrohydrodynamics of liquid

helium.

In the present work, it will be shown that, when the condition E

E′, which corresponds

≫

to complete screening of the ﬁeld above the liquid by the surface electron charge, is satisﬁed

along with the condition that the electric ﬁeld strength considerably exceeds the critical

value, E

Ec, the equations of motion of liquid helium have an inﬁnitely large number of

≫

exact analytic solutions. Their analysis has facilitated a considerable advance in the analysis

of unsolved problems in the electrohydrodynamics of liquids with a free surface, which are

associated with the formation of singularities (cusps) and with considerable changes in the

surface geometry (formation of bubbles).

In Section 2, the equations of a vortex-free ﬂow of liquid helium with a free surface

charge are considered. In the limit of a strong electric ﬁeld, when the eﬀect of the force

of gravity and capillary forces can be neglected, the approach to an analysis of the liquid

helium dynamics proposed in our earlier work [13] is developed. This approach is based on

the separation of two branches corresponding to solutions increasing and decreasing with

time in the equations of motion. In Section 3, it is shown that the asymptotic behavior of

the system is given by the well-known equations describing the Laplacian growth in the 3D

geometry (the motion equipotential boundary with the velocity determined by the normal

derivative of the harmonic potential). Section 4 is devoted to an analysis of the dynamics of

the formation of cuspidal dimples on the helium surface in 2D geometry, when the Laplacian

growth equations have an unlimited number of exact nontrivial solutions. The propagation

of nonlinear surface waves in the short-wave region in which the surface pressure must be

taken into account along with the electrostatic pressure is considered in Section 5.

It is

shown that the problem of the proﬁle of a progressive electrocapillary wave at the liquid

helium boundary has exact analytic solutions similar to the Crapper solutions for capillary

waves [14]. These solution are used for obtaining a nonlinear dispersion relation for surface

waves of an arbitrary amplitude, whose analysis led to a number of conclusions concerning

the stability of the charged surface of liquid helium to ﬁnite-amplitude perturbations and

the domain of the existence of wave solutions to the electrohydrodynamic equations.

In

Section 6, the simplest axisymmetric solutions of the equations of motion, describing the

pulling of the surface into the bulk of the liquid at a constant rate, are analyzed.

II.

INITIAL EQUATIONS: THE LIMIT OF A STRONG FIELD

Let us consider the potential motion of an ideal dielectric liquid (liquid helium) with a

free surface charged by electrons in an electric ﬁeld. We assume that, in the unperturbed

state, the boundary of the liquid is a ﬂat horizontal surface z = 0 and the ﬁeld vector is

directed along the z axis of our system of coordinates (Fig. 1). We introduce a function

η(x, y, t) specifying the deviation of the boundary from the plane. Then, the shape of the

perturbed surface of liquid helium is described by the equation z = η(x, y, t). The velocity

potential Φ for an incompressible liquid satisﬁed the Laplace equation

where ϕ is the electric potential in the liquid (we assume that the charge completely screens

the ﬁeld above the helium surface). The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the time-

dependent Bernoulli equation (4) is responsible for electrostatic pressure, the second is re-

sponsible for capillary pressure, and the third takes into account the eﬀect of the ﬁeld of

gravity. We assume that the characteristic spatial of surface perturbations is smaller than

the size of the region occupied by the liquid. In this case, we can write

Φ

i.e., the motion of the liquid attenuates at inﬁnity. The time evolution of the free surface is

determined by the kinematic relation (the condition that the liquid does not ﬂow through

its boundary):

It should be noted that, in zero electric ﬁeld (E = 0 and, hence,

ϕ = 0) the above equations

coincide with the equation of motion for a thick layer of liquid in the ﬁeld gravity.

Let the electric ﬁeld strength exceed considerably its critical value (E

Ec), and let the

following relation hold for the characteristic wavelength λ of surface waves: αE−2

≪
E2/(gρ). It follows from the dispersion relation (1) that, in an analysis of small-amplitude

≪

λ

≫

surface perturbation, we can disregard the eﬀect of both the capillary forces and the force of

gravity. In Secton 4, we will prove that this statement also holds for ﬁnite-amplitude surface

perturbations. This means that we can omit the last two terms on the right-hand side of

the boundary condition (4) and take into account the electrostatic pressure alone.

Now we pass to the dimensionless notation, assuming that the unit of length is equal to
λ, the unit of electric ﬁeld strength is E, and the unit of time is λE−1(4πρ)1/2. In this case,

the equations of motion (3)–(9) assume the form

i.e., the boundary conditions can be speciﬁed separately for the sum and the diﬀerence of

(cid:12)

while the shape of the liquid helium boundary is determined from the relation

Thus, the equations of motion can be split into two systems of equations for potentials
φ(+) and φ(−), the relation between which is given by the implicit equation for the shape

of the surface (19). It is important that these equations are compatible with the condition

φ(−) = 0 or with the condition φ(+) = 0. In the next section, we will show that the former

condition corresponds to the solutions of the problem whose amplitude increases with time,

while the latter (which is of no interest to us), to damped solutions.

The possibility of separating equations into individual branches is due to the symmetries

of the electrohydrodynamic equations, which can be easily seen when the Hamilton formalism

is used. Indeed, the equations of motion (10)–(15) for a liquid with a free surface possess a
|z=η being canonically conjugate

Hamilton structure, the function η(x, y, t) and ψ(x, y, t) = Φ

quantities [15],

It should be recalled that the harmonic potentials Φ and ˜ϕ attenuate for z

and

→ −∞

their values on the surface are deﬁned by the functions ψ and η, respectively. Consequently,

if ψ = η, then Φ = ˜ϕ, and the kinetic energy functional K coincides, expect for the sing,

with the potential energy functional P . This allows us to write the Hamilton equations of

motion using the functional K alone:

It can be seen that, if we set ψ = η in these equations, they will coincide. This means that
the condition ψ = η or (which is the same) the condition φ(−) = 0 is compatible with the

equations of motion for liquid helium. Similarly, we can prove that the Hamilton equations

−

coincide for ψ =

η, which corresponds to the condition φ(+) = 0. It should also be noted

that the equations describing the evolution of the system on the branches φ(+) = 0 and
φ(−) = 0 coincide except for the substitution t

t, which is associated with the time

reversibility in the Hamilton equations of motion.

In this case, the conditions φ(±) = 0

single out the solutions of the problem for which H is equal to zero.

systems can be found by substituting potentials in the form φ(±)

ω(±) =

±

(the same result follows directly from the dispersion relation (1) considered in the strong

ﬁeld limit). It can be seen that, for one branch, small periodic perturbations of the surface
increase exponentially with the characteristic times k−1, while, for the other branch, these
perturbations attenuate. In this case, for large periods of time, we can assume that φ(−) = 0

and consider only equations for potential φ(+). Let us prove that this statement is also valid

in the general case, when the evolution of the surface is described by nonlinear equations

(16)–(19).

We assume that, in the nonlinear equations of motion (16)–(19),

φ(+) = ϕ + z,

φ(−) = 0,

which, in accordance with the results of linear analysis, isolates the solutions increasing with

time. Passing to the moving fame of reference

the liquid. These equations deﬁne explicitly the motion of the free charged surface of liquid
helium z′ = η′(x, y, t). They coincide with the equations describing the so-called Laplacian

growth, viz., the motion of the phase boundary with a velocity directly proportional to

the normal derivative of a certain harmonic scalar ﬁeld (ϕ in our case). Depending on the

9

(22)

(23)

10

(24)

chosen frame of reference, this ﬁeld may have the meaning of temperature (Stefan’s problem

in the quasi-stationary limit), electrostatic potential (electrolytic deposition), or pressure

(ﬂow through a porous medium).

Let us prove that the solutions of Eqs. (10)–(15) corresponding to system (20)–(23) are
stable to small perturbations of potential φ(−). It should be noted that the motion of the

liquid boundary described by Eqs. (20)–(23) is always directed inwardly; this is associated
with the principle of the extremum for harmonic functions. Let function η′ at the initial

instant t = 0 be a single-valued function of variables x and y. In this case, for t > 0, the

following inequality holds: η′(x, y, t)

η′(x, y, 0). In the original notation, we have

≤

η(x, y, t)

η(x, y, 0) + t

≤

for any x and y. This inequality remains valid for small perturbations of φ(−) also, when
the eﬀect of potential φ(−) in relation (19) can be disregarded as compared to the eﬀect of

potential φ(+), and the motion of the boundary is described by the same Eqs. (20)–(23).

As regards the evolution of potential φ(−), it is described, for small

φ(−)

, by Eqs. (16)–

(18), where it is suﬃcient to consider the condition (17) at the boundary in the linear

approximation:

φ(−)

−

z = η(x, y, t).

Let us suppose that, at the initial instant t = 0, the potential distribution is described by

the following expression:

|t=0 = φ0(x, y, z),
where φ0 is a certain function which is harmonic for z

φ(−)

η(x, y, 0) and attenuating for
. In this case, the temporal dynamics of potential φ(−) is described by the expression

≤

z

→ −∞

φ(−) = φ0(x, y, z

t).

−

It can be seen from this expression that the singularities of the function φ(−) are displaced

in the direction of the z axis and can exist only in the region

z > η(x, y, 0) + t.

(25)

A comparison of this inequality with (24) shows that the singularities of potential φ(−) do

not approach the liquid helium boundary z = η(x, y, t) and, hence, the value of the potential

11

at the surface does not increase with time. It should be noted that, otherwise, the solutions
obtained by us for φ(−) would be inapplicable.

In view of incompressibility of the liquid, the level of its surface (the value of function η

averaged over the spatial variables) is not displaced. On the other hand, the boundary of

the region deﬁned by inequality (25) and averaged over x and y, in which singularities of the

function φ(−) occurs, moves upwards at a constant velocity. This means that the singularity
moves away from the surface of liquid helium and the perturbation of φ(−) relaxes to zero.

Thus, we have proved that, as t

, we have

ϕ(x, y, z, t) + z

Φ(x, y, z, t),

→

and Eqs. (20)–(23) describe the asymptotic behavior of liquid helium with a charged surface

in a strong electric ﬁeld.

IV. SOLUTIONS OF 2D EQUATIONS OF MOTION

In the previous section, we proved that the analysis of the 3D potential motion of liquid

helium in a strong electric ﬁeld can be reduced to analysis of Eqs. (20)–(23) describing the

three-dimensional Laplacian growth. The exact solvability of these equations in the 2D

geometry will allow us to eﬀectively study the dynamics of the development of instability of

the charged surface of a liquid, including the formation of singularities in it.

We assume that, in the system of equations (20)–(23), all quantities are independent of

variable y (variable y′). We introduce the function w = v
Z = x + iz′, which is analytic for z′

iϕ of the complex argument
η′(x, t) (this is the co-called complex potential of the

−

≤

ﬁeld correct to a constant factor). Here, v is a function harmonically conjugate to ϕ and

such that the condition v = const deﬁnes the electric ﬁeld lines in the medium. Clearly,

It is convenient for the subsequent analysis to pass to a system of coordinates in which

the role of the independent variable is played by quantity w and the role of the unknown

function is played by function Z which is analytic in the lower half-plane of the complex

variable w (i.e., for ϕ > 0). It follows from condition (23) that the following condition holds

at inﬁnity:

We can also obtain the condition for Z at the boundary ϕ = 0 of the half-plane. The proﬁle

of the liquid helium surface can be speciﬁed by the parametric relations

z′ = z′(v, t) = η′(x(v, t), t),

x = x(v, t).

Using these relations, we can easily express the normal velocity of the surface and the electric
ﬁeld strength appearing in formulas (21) in terms of the functions z′(v, t) and x(v, t):

or, which is the same,

(27)

Thus, we arrive at the problem of determining the function Z, which is analytic in the

lower half-plane of the complex variable w and satisﬁes conditions (26) and (27). The

nonlinear condition (27) is the so-called Laplacian growth equation which is widely used

for describing the 2D motion of the boundary between two liquids with noticeably diﬀerent

viscosities [16, 17], the evolution of the free surface of a liquid in the ﬁeld of gravity [18, 19],

and so on. The Laplacian growth equation is integrable in the sense that it has an inﬁnitely

large number of particular solutions of the form [20]

Here, an are complex constants, and the functions of time wn satisfy the condition Im(wn) >

condition (26) and, hence, the condition of localization of the perturbation of the surface in

a certain region: η

Im(wn); in this case, the eﬀect

of this term on the evolution of the surface is negligibly small.

Substituting expression (28) into Eq. (27) and decomposing the obtained expression into

Let us suppose that a1 = +1 and we are dealing with a solitary perturbation of the

surface, which is directed ”upwards”. It can be seen from Eq. (30) that for large values

equation (see Fig. 2). It can easily be proved that similar solutions are possible in the 3D

case also. It can be seen from Eqs. (20)–(23) describing the three-dimensional Laplacian

growth that, if the surface initially contains a region in which the ﬁeld strength ∂nϕ is small

(e.g., in the vicinity of the apex of a 3D ﬁngerlike perturbation of the surface), its velocity in

the coordinates

x, y, z′

{

}

is also small. In the laboratory reference frame, this corresponds

to a jet ﬂowing at a constant velocity in the direction of the z axis.

Let us now consider a solitary perturbation of the surface, which is directed ”downwards”

(a1 =

1, q(t)

−

1). This solution exists only during a ﬁnite period of time, leading to the

formation of a singularity on the liquid surface, viz., cuspidal point of the ﬁrst kind (Fig. 3),

at instant t = tc. Indeed, expanding z and x into power series in v and τ taking into account

the fact that the function q(t) in the vicinity of the tc satisﬁes the relation

we obtain the following expressions in the main order:

x = v3/3 + v√2τ .

It can be seen that, at instant τ = 0 (i.e., for t = tc), the shape of the surface in the vicinity

of a singularity point is deﬁned by the relation 2z =

tendency [12, 24] to the emergence of dimples on the surface, which become sharpened over a

ﬁnite time. From the mathematical point of view, the emergence of singularity on the liquid

surface is associated with vanishing of the Jacobian of the transformation

It is important to note that the singular solution of the problem described by expressions

(31) is also valid in the case when the ﬁeld above the surface is not screened completely; i.e.,

the condition E′

≪

E does not hold. As a matter of fact, in the vicinity of a singularity,

the condition of the smallness of the ﬁeld above the surface as compared to the ﬁeld in the

bulk of the liquid naturally holds. In addition, the condition λ

E2/(gρ) is not necessary.

≪

This is due to the fact that the amplitude of surface perturbations remains ﬁnite, and the

eﬀect of the gravity forces is always negligibly small in the vicinity of the cusp.

Let us now consider the capillary eﬀects. The surface and the electrostatic pressure in

the vicinity of a singularity can be estimated easily:

αE−2 is satisﬁed, the capillary forces are small as compared

that, when the condition λ

to electrostatic forces and, hence, can be disregarded at the stage of formation of cusps.

This is the only necessary condition of the applicability of the Laplacian growth equation

and its solutions (31) in the vicinity of singularities.

V. ELECTROCAPILLARY WAVES

Let us consider the case when the characteristic length of the surface waves is comparable

with the value of αE−2 and the capillary eﬀects must be taken into consideration. We

assume that condition E

Ec is satisﬁed; in this case, the eﬀect of the force of gravity can

≫

be neglected. The dispersion relation (1) for electrocapillary waves at the charged boundary
of liquid helium for E′ = 0 in the dimensionless notation introduced in Secton 2 assumes

the form

ω2(k) = k3

k2,

−

where the value of λ = 4παE−2 is taken for unit length.

It can be seen from Eq. (32)

that ω2 < 0 for k < 1 and, hence, aperiodic electrohydrodynamic instability of the liquid

surface develops.

If, however, the condition k > 1 holds, the frequency ω is real-valued,

which corresponds to the propagation of linear dispersive waves.

The approach to the study of the evolution of a charged liquid surface based on the anal-

ysis of relation (32) is obviously applicable only in the case of small-amplitude perturbations
k−1. For ﬁnite-amplitude waves, the nonlinear eﬀect may consist in

of the boundary: A

≪

the dependence of the dispersion relation on A (see, for example, [25]):

ω = ω(k, A).

The amplitude dependence of frequency is usually sought in the form of a power series in A

(Stokes expansion), which limits the analysis to the weak-nonlinearity limit. Let us prove

that, for electrocapillary waves, an exact solution to the nonlinear dispersion relation can

be found.

The equations describing a progressive wave (whose proﬁle does not change in the refer-

ence frame attached to the wave) can be obtained from the electrohydrodynamic equations

(3)–(9) with the help of the following substitutions:

ϕ = ϕ(x′, z),

Φ = Φ′(x′, z) + Cx′,

η = η(x′),

where x′ = x

These equations can be simpliﬁed by introducing the function of current Ψ(x′, z), which is
harmonically conjugate to potential Φ′:

This function satisﬁes the Laplace equation

with the boundary conditions

which follow from relations (36) and (38). It can easily be seen that Eqs. (40)–(42) coincide

with the Eqs. (34), (37) and (39) for the electric potential. Consequently, the following

functional relation exists:

Ψ = Cϕ.

Equations (34), (37), (39) and (43) coincide except for constant factors with the equations

describing the shape of a progressive capillary wave [14] and an equilibrium conﬁguration of

the charged surface of the liquid metal [26]. These equations have exact periodic solutions

for which the boundary of the liquid is deﬁned by the parametric expressions

It can be seen that, in the limit of inﬁnitely small amplitudes (A

transformed into the linear dispersion relation (32). Let us consider the consequences of this

nonlinearity. It can be seen from relation (47) that, for a ﬁxed wave number k

It follows from conditions (48) that, for 1

(45) deﬁne the solution of the problem on the steady-state proﬁle of the charged surface of

the liquid helium. For k > γk1, the amplitude has the maximum value for electrocapillary

waves propagating at the velocity C =

(the curve describing this dependence is presented in Fig. 4). If the amplitude exceeds this

p

value, expressions (44) and (45) describe a self-intersecting surface, which cannot be realized

from the physical considerations, or ω2 < 0, which corresponds to incorrectly formulated

problem in the context wave propagation. This leads to the assumption that the condition

A(k) > Amax(k) is the criterion of hard excitation of electrohydrodynamic instability of

a plane charged suface of liquid helium, which generalizes the simplest linear instability

criterion k < 1 to the case of ﬁnite-amplitude perturbation.

It should be noted that peak of the function Amax(k) corresponds to k = γ. The shape

of the liquid surface corresponding to this value of the wave number is depicted in Fig. 5.

It can be seen that the liquid acquires cavities. Such solutions reﬂect the tendency to

the formation of charged bubbles (referred to as bubblons in the experimental work [12])

on cuspidal dimples of the liquid helium boundary. The main mechanism of departure of

electrons from the surface is associated with the generation of such bubbles.

VI. AXISYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS

Let us consider the evolution of the charged surface of liquid helium in an important case

of the axial symmetry of the problem. The equations of motion (20)–(23) corresponding

At essentially nonlinear stages of the formation of a dimple on the surface of a liquid, we

can assume that the electric ﬁeld in the region of a large curvature of the surface is much

In this case, the dynamics of the boundary

stronger than the external ﬁeld,

t is completely determined by the intrinsic ﬁeld rapidly attenuating with increasing

distance, which allows us to use the condition

→ −∞

| →

instead of the condition

higher than the velocity of the origin in the laboratory reference frame (i.e.,

ηt| ≫

1). In

this case, we can substitute η for η′ and z for z′. This gives

In relation (50), we have used the following conditions at the boundary of the liquid:

The conditions of the applicability of this approximation will be considered at the end of

this section.

A particular solution of Eqs. (49)–(52) can be obtain by using a substitution similar to

that used in [27] for constructing the axisymmetric solutions of the Stefan problem:

19

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

20

(55)

(56)

(57)

where the constant V has the meaning of the inward-directed velocity of the liquid surface.

It can easily be seen that the equipotential surfaces corresponding to Eqs. (53) and (54)

form a family of confocal paraboloids of revolution:

r2 = 2u(z + V t) + u2

with the focus at the point r = 0 and z =

V t.

−

Substituting expressions (53) and (54) into Eq. (49), we arrive at the following ordinary

diﬀerential equation:

ufuu + fu = 0.

It follows from Eqs. (50) and (51) that the boundary conditions to this equation have the

form

fu(u0) = V /2,

f (u0) = 0.

Here, u0 is the value of parameter u at the surface of the liquid. Henceforth, we will use the

quantity K = 1/u0 which, in accordance with Eq. (55), deﬁnes the curvature of the liquid

surface at the symmetry axis. Solving Eqs. (56) and (57), we obtain

f (u) = V ln(Ku)/(2K),

(58)

which, together with Eqs. (53) and (54), describes the time evolution of the electric potential.

It should be noted that condition (52) is naturally satisﬁed. The shape of the surface for

the given exact solution of the equations of motion (49)–(52) is deﬁned by the relation

η(r, t) = Kr2/2

V t

−

−

(2K)−1,

(59)

which corresponds to needle-shaped dimple pulled into the bulk of the liquid velocity V .

Such a geometry of the surface perturbation can be regarded as the simplest (paraboloidal)

approximation of the shape of the liquid boundary at essentially nonlinear stages of the

development of instability of the charged boundary of the liquid.

It should be recalled that the applicability of approximation (49)–(52) of the initial system

(20)–(23) is limited by the conditions

1 and

ϕ

1. Since ηt =

V in solutions

ηt| ≫

|

|∇

| ≫

−

(59) for any r and t, the ﬁrst condition is reduced to the inequality V

1 (in the dimensional

≫

notation, V

E√4πρ). As regards the second condition, we can ﬁnd the characteristic size

≫

D of the region in which the electric ﬁeld created by a charged paraboloidal surface exceeds

the external ﬁeld. It follows from relations (53), (54) and (58) that the ﬁeld distribution in

the liquid is described by the relation

21

ϕ

=

|∇

|

V
K√2Ru

.

Here, R =

attains it maximum value equal to V at the point r = 0 and z =

r2 + (z + V t)2 is the distance to the focus of the paraboloid; i.e., the ﬁeld
(2K)−1. Since

V t

p

the ﬁeld strength generally decreases in proportion to R−1 with increasing distance from

−

−

the focus, the scale of D can be estimated as D

V /K. It should be noted that such a

∼

conclusion makes sense only if the value of D is much larger than the radius of the curvature

K −1 of the surface perturbation. This requirement again leads us to the inequality V

1.

≫

Thus, we have obtained partial axisymmetric solutions to the equations of motion of

liquid helium with a charged surface, which describe the evolution of a localized perturbation

of the surface with a considerable curvature, and have determined the conditions of their

applicability. However, the obtained solutions should not be regarded as general-position

solutions.

In all probability, solutions of the burst type, for which the surface becomes

indeﬁnitely cuspidate over a ﬁnite time interval, will dominate as in the 2D case.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In the absence of a surface charge, the equations of electrohydrodynamics of liquid helium

considered by us are transformed into the well-known equations of a vortex-free ﬂow of

an incompressible liquid with a free boundary. These equations are extremely diﬃcult to

analyze, and the methods for the solution have not been developed at present. In this work,

we succeeded in proving that the inclusion of the electrostatic pressure does not complicate

the analysis of these equations. On the contrary, the emergence of an additional term in

the dynamic boundary condition introduces a certain symmetry into the equations so that

they become compatible with the conditions ϕ + z =

Φ. The emerging functional relation

±

between the potentials of velocity and of electric ﬁeld makes it possible to reduce by half the

number of equations required for describing the motion of the surface and, in the long run,

to ﬁnd a wide class of exact solutions of the equations of motion of liquid helium with the

boundary charged by electrons. It is important that the solutions obtained by us are not

limited by the condition of smallness of surface perturbations; they describe the evolution

22

of the liquid boudary up to the formation of cuspidal points in it.

The dynamics of the formation of singularities in the case when the characteristic scale

λ of surface perturbations is comparable with the value of αE−2 and the capillary eﬀects

must be taken into consideration has not been considered by us here. In 2D geometry, such

an analysis can be carried out using the methods of investigations of 2D potential ﬂows

with a free boundary, which was proposed in [28, 29] and is based on conformal mapping

of the region occupied by the liquid to a half-plane. In terms of the present work, such a

transformation corresponds to the use of the ﬁeld potential ϕ and its harmonically conjugate

function v as independent variables. In the case of the axial symmetry of the problem (such

a geometry reﬂects the experimentally observed phenomena [12, 24] most correctly), the for-

mation of singularities can be described by self-similar solutions of the electrohydrodynamic

equations, which are analogous to those considered in the recent publication [30] devoted to

the formation of conic tips on the surface of a liquid metal in an external electric ﬁeld. In

accordance with the self-similar scenario of the development of instability, conical dimples
with an angle of 98.6◦ appear on the surface over a ﬁnite time. A detailed analysis of these

processes calls for further investigations.

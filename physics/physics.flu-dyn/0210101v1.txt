It is common to relate the dynamic contact angle θd to the relative speed between the
substrate and the contact line; theory suggests θ3
U . In fact, available physical models
show that the dynamic angle involves speed logarithmically and in a model dependent
manner. Experimental data consistent with this interpretation is cited.

1. Introduction

One area of ﬂuid mechanics that has been the subject of a large admixture of analysis,
experiment and speculation is the subject of the moving contact line. A typical situation,
common in many coating processes, refers to the contact line at the intersection of solid,
liquid and gas regions, where the three-phase line moves relative to a solid substrate. A
basic research question in this subject stems from the violation of the no-slip condition in
the immediate neighborhood of the three-phase line of contact (e.g. Huh & Scriven 1971,
for reviews see Dussan V. (1979), de Gennes (1985), and Kistler (1993)). As a result,
within the usual continuum analysis, the stress diverges as the contact line is approached
and the energy per unit length of the moving contact line is unbounded. This result may
be viewed as an embarrassment of continuum modeling, but, in fact, it does indicate the
need for a small cut-oﬀ length scale in macroscopic theories, as well as some more input
from the physics at smaller length scales to properly interpret the meaning of any such
cut-oﬀ scale.

Perhaps the most basic feature of this problem is the aim to relate the local dynamic
contact angle θd(x), which is the arc tangent of the slope of the interface at a distance
x from the contact line, to the local speed U with which the contact line moves over
the substrate. For the case of a perfectly wetting ﬂuid (vanishing equilibrium contact
angle θeq = 0) and small θd, one ﬁnds θ3
U , which is known as Tanner’s law. The-
d ∝
oretical justiﬁcation for this result has been given (e.g. de Gennes 1985) and various
generalizations have been oﬀered. In dimensionless form, the speed is reported in terms
of the capillary number
= U η/γ, which measures the relative importance of viscous to
surface tension forces, where η is the ﬂuid viscosity and γ the interfacial tension. In fact,
the functional form for the contact angle-speed relation is commonly written for small
angles as θ3
ln(x/ℓmicro), where ℓmicro is generally taken as a molecular length
(e.g. Leger & Joanny 1992). Typically the capillary number varies over many orders of

important for interpreting experimental data, and so it is reasonable to interrogate more
closely the functional dependence on speed.

In this communication we wish to comment on one aspect of the moving contact line
problem that has, perhaps surprisingly, been largely neglected and/or unappreciated. In
particular, we note that detailed models for the perfectly wetting situation actually yield
a dynamic contact angle versus speed relation

where β depends on the physical model introduced in the neighborhood of the contact
line. We do not believe that it is necessarily appropriate to simply suppress the addi-
tional dependence on speed (i.e.
) by replacing the argument of the logarithm by either
ℓmacro/ℓmicro, where these two lengths scales are taken as constants, or x/ℓmicro. Because
, not including this additional factor of capillary number when
of the large variation in
using (1.1) to interpret dynamical experiments may lead to signiﬁcant discrepancies be-
tween theory and experiment. Here we outline the basic idea behind (1.1) and present
experimental evidence that supports the above interpretation.

C

Another point that has received insuﬃcient attention is the range of validity of equation
(1.1). Near the contact line, (1.1) breaks down where x is of the same order as ℓmicro. This
restriction is evident as the general structure comes from a balance of viscous and surface
tension forces alone. Not surprisingly, we estimate below that the microscopic scale is
between several Angstroms and tens of Angstroms, depending on the microscopic forces
assumed to be acting near the contact line.

Towards large scales, x is commonly taken to be a static scale such as the capillary
length or the size of a spreading drop (de Gennes 1985). Nevertheless, it should be noted
that the ﬂow near a moving contact line often resembles a coating ﬂow, similar to the
classical problem studied by Landau and Levich (e.g. Levich 1962). This leads to the
appearance of another, dynamical length scale, that can become much smaller than the
capillary length as the capillary number is small, which is typically the case. Thus a
meaningful comparison between (1.1) and a macroscopic measurement of the dynamical
contact angle might require a spatial resolution signiﬁcantly below 1/10 or even 1/100
of the capillary length.

In the next section we will introduce two diﬀerent models commonly used to treat
moving contact line problems such as a spreading drop or a tape plunging into a pool of
ﬂuid. Then, in the third section we show that the lubrication equations corresponding
to both models have similarity solutions for the interfacial shape that ﬁx the functional
dependence on the capillary number. The fourth section discusses the dynamical problem
that equation (1.1) has to be matched to on an appropriate outer length scale. In the ﬁfth
section we explain measurable consequences of the two models for the dynamic contact
angle, and discuss an experiment that helps to distinguish between them. We close with
a summary and possible directions of future work.

2. The model

The usual dynamic balance for the steady ﬂow “far” from the contact line involves
capillary and viscous stresses. As the contact line is approached, the capillary-viscous ﬂow
leads to a stress singularity. A number of diﬀerent physical eﬀects have been suggested
to relieve the singularity, and these either account for the fact that on very small length
scales van der Waals forces act to maintain a ﬁnite thickness liquid layer on the solid
substrate, or that at very high shear rates the boundary conditions and the transport

coeﬃcients of the ﬂuid are likely to be altered. Which model is appropriate might depend
on the physical system at hand, or be a combination of the above. In Table 1 we provide a
short overview of proposed physical models for ﬂow in the neighborhood of a contact line;
see also McKinley & Ovryn (1998). Most recently, there has been a considerable eﬀort
to base the understanding of the contact line physics on a microscopic, particle-based
description, see for example Koplik et al (1989), Ruijter et al. (1999), and Abraham et
al. (2002). The so-called “diﬀuse interface model” (see e.g. Seppecher (1996), Chen et
al. (2000), and Pomeau (2002)) represents an intermediate approach, which models the
liquid-gas interface as a Cahn-Hilliard ﬂuid. This allows for example the extraction of
eﬀective interface equations (Pismen & Pomeau (2000)) diﬀerent from those proposed by
de Gennes’s (1985).

Below we restrict our attention to two diﬀerent models which have proved particularly
popular. The results are suﬃcient to highlight the measurable diﬀerences between diﬀer-
ent physical mechanisms. In model I, due to de Gennes and coworkers (e.g. Hervet & de
Gennes 1982, de Gennes 1985), van der Waals forces are taken into account, so very close
to the contact line there is a balance between surface tension and van der Waals stresses
alone. In model II, proposed for example by Huh and Mason (1977) and Hocking (1977),
the ﬂuid is allowed to slip across the solid surface over a small slip length.

For simplicity, we only consider the case of perfectly wetting ﬂuids, i.e. of zero equilib-
rium contact angle. Consistent with the local balances, the interface near the contact line
remains nearly ﬂat and we can use lubrication theory to describe the ﬂuid motion. This
approach amounts to a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of the mathematical treatment relative
to the full two-dimensional ﬂow problem (Cox 1986), but agrees with the full calculation
when the dynamic contact angle is small. There are numerous indications that the small-
angle theory in fact remains valid for slopes of order unity. For example, θ3
d/9 in equation
(1.1) diﬀers by only 2% from the full expression (Cox 1986), derived without the beneﬁt
of lubrication theory, up to a slope of 1. Also, Fermigier & Jenﬀer (1991) reported that
small-angle theory holds experimentally up to an angle of 100◦.

To be able to describe an experiment like a ﬂat plate plunging with velocity U into
a reservoir of ﬂuid (see Figure 1), it is necessary to include other terms beyond the
lubrication terms close to the contact line. Namely, we keep the full curvature term and
include gravity. By doing this, the model is able to describe the crossover to a purely
static, horizontal surface far away from the dynamical region. A basic unit of length is
γ
gρ , which dictates the scale of the interface curvature far
the capillary length ℓc =
away from the contact line. In the van der Waals model I, which accounts for pressure
variations owing to capillary, van der Waals, and gravitational forces, the equation for

replaced by a cylinder which can be tilted at diﬀerent angles α. We also schematically indicate

measures the strength of van der Waals forces relative to interfacial forces and is typically
very small (on the order of Angstroms).

Another distinct approach for the ﬂow near the contact line is to introduce slip at
the boundary, consistent with allowing the contact line to move parallel to the wall at a
ﬁnite speed; the slip is a function of the shear rate. The simplest such law, introduced by
Navier in the same paper that also enunciated the Navier-Stokes equation (Navier 1823),

version of (2.3), in which λ is itself a non-linear function of the shear rate, has been
proposed in Thompson & Troian (1997). A standard calculation (appendix 1), leads to

3. Scaling solutions near the contact line

We now focus on the immediate neighborhood of the contact line, which we assume
h′′
to be at x = 0. Owing to the ﬂatness of the interface we can assume that κ
and gravitational inﬂuences can be neglected, but dynamical (viscous) eﬀects have to be
included. In the case of model I, equation (2.1) reduces to

The boundary condition at the contact line incorporates the wetting behavior of the
ﬂuid. The basic assumption is that there is a microscopic length scale on which static
forces dominate over dynamical ones, and a static proﬁle can be assumed microscopically
close to the contact line.

In model I, following Hervet & de Gennes (1984), we are going to match φ1(x) to
a “maximal” ﬁlm solution, corresponding to very strong wetting, whose thickness only
goes to zero at (minus) inﬁnity. However this maximal solution very closely approximates
parabolic solutions of (3.1) that go to zero at some ﬁnite contact line position (Hervet &

and defer further details to appendix 2. Using (3.8) as an initial condition with adjustable
parameter ǫ, we integrate (3.3) towards ξ1
. The parameter ǫ is ﬁxed to select the
solution with vanishing curvature at inﬁnity. Figure 2 compares this solution with the
asymptotic form (3.7). We plot the rescaled slope φ′
1 from the solution of (3.3) as the full
curve and equation (3.7) with b1 = 1.44 as the dashed curve. This numerical value for b1

of ξ necessary for integration until a true asymptotic value is reached.

Model II, on the other hand, can be extended down to φ2(0) = 0, since the stress
singularity was successfully removed. A vanishing equilibrium contact angle θeq = 0 can
thus be implemented by taking the boundary condition φ2(0) = φ′
2(0) = 0 at the contact
line and integrating (3.4) towards ξ2
. The corresponding value of b2 for the case of
the Navier slip law was given in Hocking (1992). Thus the two constants, which establish

4. Crossover to Landau-Levich-type behavior

We now estimate the range of validity of the solution (3.7) as one moves farther away
from the contact line. These ideas have close analogy to the classical analysis of Landau
and Levich of a dynamical lubrication ﬁlm (Levich 1962). Evidently, the contact line
physics plays no role far away from the contact line, so the relevant lubrication equation
is

The crossover to scaling of the form of equation (4.3) is demonstrated in Figure 2, by
showing a full solution of equation (2.1), rescaled according to (3.2). Results are given
for two (small) values of the capillary number diﬀering by a factor of ten. Again, the
free parameter in the maximal ﬁlm solution (3.8) is used to shoot for the ﬂat interface
corresponding to the surface of the ﬂuid-ﬁlled container. For small values of ξ1, the
1/3
solution corresponds to the lubrication form given before, while on a scale x/ℓc ≈ C
the transition to the Landau-Levich region is observed. In rescaled coordinates ξ1 the
location of this crossover should thus be proportional to
itself, as is clearly seen from

problems in comparing asymptotic solutions with experimental data. To interpret the
measured dynamical contact angle equation (3.7) is no longer suﬃcient, but the full
solution of the similarity equation (3.3) has to be considered.

5. Comparison with experiment

It is common practice in the literature (e.g. de Gennes 1985, Cox 1986) to consider the
derivative of the proﬁle h(x), evaluate it at some macroscopic distance from the contact
line x = ℓmacro, and to interpret the slope of the interface in terms of the so-called
“dynamical contact angle”, tan θd(x) = dh/dx. This approach is the common one taken
in experiments as well. Thus, using the solution (3.7) in the similarity forms (3.2) and
(3.5) for models I and II, respectively, and neglecting lower-order terms, we obtain

θ3
dyn(x) = 9

C

ln(ℓmacro/L1,2),

(5.1)

where L1,2 are microscopic lengths appropriate for each model. There are two fundamen-
tal issues with this approach: First, depending on the experimental system it is not clear
what is the best choice for ℓmacro. Second, what is usually taken as a ﬁxed microscopic
length L1,2 is actually strongly dependent on the capillary number. Namely, the two
models give

L1 = a

−2/3/b1,

and

L2 = λ

−1/3/b2.

as established in (3.2) and (3.5), respectively.

C

In particular, the

dependence that appears in the microscopic length is diﬀerent in
the two models. It is also clear that it is impossible to interpret L1,2 directly in terms
of some ﬁxed microscopic length near the contact line, but rather it is a dynamical
quantity. To our knowledge, this fact has never been appreciated in either theoretical or
-
experimental work. This observation appears to be signiﬁcant, since by comparing the
C
dependence it potentially allows one to distinguish between diﬀerent microscopic models
from a macroscopic measurement. Chen and Wada (1989) imaged the proﬁle near the
contact line of a spreading droplet and so provided the ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmation
of (5.1). However, owing to the small range of capillary numbers studied, it is diﬃcult
to distinguish between the two lengths L1,2 deﬁned in (5.2). Below we will therefore
concentrate on another experiment (Marsh, Garoﬀ & Dussan 1993), which allowed
to
be varied over more than two orders of magnitude.

C

C

It is also interesting to note that the logarithmic dependence on capillary number was
only obtained in the fully nonlinear treatment outlined above. In the classical studies of
the ﬂow in the neighborhood of the dynamic contact angle, for example in Cox (1986),
a matched asymptotic analysis is used which further assumes a form involving integer
and does not recognize that the scale of the inner region can itself involve
powers of

. However the form of the asymptotics (5.1), implying a logarithmic dependence on
C
C
in the full solution, clearly shows that the proﬁle cannot be expanded in integer powers
of C. As a result, the classical analyses are not able to identify the sort of dependencies
given by (5.2). Although these dependencies are only logarithmic, as mentioned above,
the capillary number often varies through many orders of magnitude in experiments, so
the logarithm in (5.1) can in general not be approximated by a constant, as is most often
done (e.g. King 2001).

In a recent experiment, the eﬀect of large variations of

on the contact line was
investigated very carefully by Marsh et al. (1993), who measured the dynamic contact
angles on a cylinder plunging at an angle into a liquid bath. These authors essentially
used the form (5.1) to ﬁt the whole shape of the interface close to the contact line, and

included static contributions to account for the eﬀects of surface tension and gravity
away from the contact line. (Note that instead of the third power on the left hand side,
x3/9
they actually used a more complicated function g(x), but which becomes g(x)
for small arguments. This limit is relevant for the small angle case we are studying here.)
This approach leaves out dynamical eﬀects of the kind predicted by Landau and Levich
(Levich 1962), which are important on an intermediate scale between the microscopic
ones and the capillary length, and should be taken into account in a more reﬁned theory.
Marsh et al. (1993) treat the static contact angle θeq (called θact by the authors) as a free,
and possibly
-dependent, parameter, to be determined from experiment. The authors
conclude that for their system θeq = 0, which is the case treated here.

C

From the ﬁt of (5.1) to their data, Marsh et al. (1993) extract a length L, which
is found to depend signiﬁcantly on capillary number, as suggested by (5.2)! They also
report L to be independent of the tilt angle α within experimental error, which further
emphasizes that the response is dominated by local features. In Figure 3 we present a
plot of the measured length as function of capillary number, and compare it with the
slopes suggested by the van der Waals model I and the Navier slip model II, respectively.
Although it is diﬃcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions owing to the large scatter in the data,
2/3 seems to be favored. Using the two diﬀerent ﬁts plotted in Figure 3, we are also
able to determine the cut-oﬀ lengths a and λ, assuming that the corresponding physical

However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no reason why a single cutoﬀ
mechanism should necessarily dominate in the experiment, which would lead to still other
exponents. Additional mechanisms for relieving the contact line singularity are listed in
Table 1; which is the dominant mechanism could also depend on capillary number and,
in particular, on the type of solid substrate or ﬂuid involved.

6. Conclusions

d ∝ C

We have considered ﬂow local to a moving contact line using a lubrication approach.
Our basic message has been to indicate that the appearance of logarithmic corrections
in capillary number to the usual “Tanner’s law”, θ3
, are a general feature of the
mechanical response. The interpretation of the results is that the “microscopic” length
scale that is involved when supplying a small-scale cut-oﬀ to relieve the well-known
stress singularity in the moving contact line problem is a dynamical (speed dependent)
quantity. Experimental data consistent with this interpretation is cited, and microscopic
parameters that come from the comparison with diﬀerent theories agree with physical
considerations.

Since important applications of contact line theories apply to angles up to 180◦, it
would be very useful to extend the lubrication theory considered here to a full two-
dimensional treatment of the ﬂow in the corner region. We suspect that large parts of
the calculation in Cox (1986), which erroneously assumes a regular expansion in
, could
be adapted to a proper similarity description. This means that the dynamical contact
, x/L1,2), where L1,2 is one of the dynamical length
angle has the scaling form θd = f (
C
scales deﬁned by (5.2), with corresponding forms for the velocity ﬁeld as well. Such a
theory might be able to explain more recent experiments (Chen, Ram´e & Garoﬀ 1995) on
moving contact lines performed at higher capillary numbers, yielding dynamical contact
angles of up to 155◦.

C

Furthermore, the velocity of the contact line relative to the substrate is in general
not perpendicular to the contact line, as highlighted in recent experiments of droplets
running down an inclined plane (Podgorski, Flesselles & Limat 2001). In this case the
ﬂow is truly three-dimensional, and it may no longer be suﬃcient to simply project the
velocity onto the normal to the contact line (Blake & Ruschak 1979). Such a three-
dimensional description would be necessary to complete our understanding of corner
singularities that form at the back of running drops (Stone et al. 2002), and may apply
to a range of other contact line phenomena as well.

hydrostatic pressure variations into the pressure p, the velocity parallel to the plate can
be represented as a second-order polynomial

u = a0 + a1y + y2 p′

∂u/∂y vanish, giving a1 =

Since the contact line is stationary, the mass ﬂux through the ﬁlm is zero everywhere,

where A is Hamaker’s constant. Substituting (7.3) into (7.2) and assuming λ = 0 gives
(2.1), while A = 0 at ﬁnite λ leads to (2.4).

8. Appendix 2: expansion for the maximal ﬁlm

Here we give some more details on the solution of (3.1) for the “maximal ﬁlm” of

Hervet and de Gennes (1984). The general form of the ﬁlm proﬁle is

where we denote the similarity variable by ξ. This expansion has no free parameters, as
the values of the coeﬃcients ai are obtained directly from substituting (8.1) into (3.1).
We ﬁnd

a0 =

However, there is a one-parameter family of solutions of (3.1) that decay for ξ

This solution is found by linearizing around the base solution (8.1), i.e. φ(ξ) = φ0(ξ) +

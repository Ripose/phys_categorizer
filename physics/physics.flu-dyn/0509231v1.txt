Abstract

The occurrence of swarms of small bubbles in a variety of industrial systems enhances their

performance. However, the eﬀects that size polydispersity may produce on the stability of kinematic

waves, the gain factor, mean bubble velocity, kinematic and dynamic wave velocities is, to our

knowledge, not yet well established. We found that size polydispersity enhances the stability of a

bubble column by a factor of about 23% as a function of frequency and for a particular type of

bubble column. In this way our model predicts eﬀects that might be veriﬁed experimentally but

this, however, remain to be assessed. Our results reinforce the point of view advocated in this

work in the sense that a description of a bubble column based on the concept of randomness of a

bubble cloud and average properties of the ﬂuid motion, may be a useful approach that has not

been exploited in engineering systems.

INTRODUCTION

The theoretical description of multiphase ﬂows is essentially based on analyzing the re-

ponse of a cloud of dispersed particles of diﬀerent size ranges in a ﬂuid. These particles

constitute dynamic phases and hence a multiphase ﬂow. A widely used multiphase system

is a bubble column which is a reactor where a discontinuous gas phase in the form of bubbles,

moves relative to a continuous phase. Bubble columns have a wide range of applications in

chemical industries, biotechnology or in nuclear reactors [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. The transient

behavior is important at the start-up of these systems and its analysis is essential in order

to characterize the dynamic performance of the columns. Among the phenomena that occur

in these systems void wave propagation mechanisms are of great importance since many

transient and steady states are controlled by the propagation of these waves and, in this

sense among others, the dynamic characterization of multiphase ﬂows is essential for the

prevention of instabilities.

The (in)stability of bubbly ﬂows which are characterized by almost uniformly sized bub-

bles, is usually described in terms of the propagation properties of void fraction and pressure

disturbances caused by natural or imposed ﬂuctuations of the rate of air supply [6], [7], [8].

Bubble size, rise velocity, size distribution and liquid and bubble velocity proﬁle have a direct

bearing on the performance of bubble columns. However, most of the time the dispersion

devices deliver a dispersed phase with a given size distribution. The importance of the size

distributions is only scarcely evaluated, most of the time by direct empirical trials and its

inﬂuence on the global behavior has still to be studied. Actually, to our knowledge and from

the theoretical point of view, it has not been yet well established whether the stability of the

motion of a swarm of bubbles is diﬀerent for monodispersed or polydispersed bubble ﬂows.

The main objective of this work is to investigate the eﬀects that size polydispersity might

produce on the stability of a bubble column. We shall introduce the eﬀect of polidispersity

through the drag force in the hydrodynamic equations, using a method based on statistical

concepts and on a point-force approximation [9]. As we shall see below, the corrections on

the drag force factor, C P

D(a), due to polydispersity depend only on the ﬁrst three moments
of a given particle size distribution and they also have an eﬀect on several properties of

kinematic waves. In particular, we found that size polydispersity enhances the stability of

void waves by a factor which varies between 4.5 − 23% as a function of frequency and for

3

a particular type of bubble column. In this way our model predicts eﬀects that might be

veriﬁed experimentally but this, however, remain to be assessed.

To this end the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy review a hydro-

dynamical model for bubbly ﬂuids introduced by Biesheuvel and Gorissen [10]. Next, in

Section 3 we consider a dispersion of spherical air bubbles of diﬀerent radi in water and we

calculate the eﬀect of size polidispersity on the gain factor, mean bubble velocity, kinematic

wave velocities as a function of void fraction, for diﬀerent wave frequencies.

II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION OF A BUBBLE DISPERSION

In this section we summarize the main ideas and steps behind the hydrodynamical model

for bubbly ﬂuids introduced in Ref. [10]. The equations of motion for a swarm of bubbles in

a bubble column have been derived in the literature by using standard methods of kinetic

theory to average over an ensamble or realizations of the ﬂow [11], [12].

In Ref.

[10] a

dispersion of equally sized air bubbles in a water column where the bubbles are small enough

to remain spherical through the whole system, is considered. They assumed that the air can

be taken as an incompressible ﬂuid where no mass transfer is allowed between the bubbles

and the water, which is assumed to be an incompressible Newtonian liquid. The conservation

equation for the mean number density of the gas bubbles, n, and the conservation equation

for the mean bubble momentum, ρGv (Kelvin impulse), were obtained for this system [13],

IL is the ﬂuid impulse, TL (x, t) and TG (x, t) are the ﬂuid stresses; FD is the drag force
exerted by the ﬂuid on the bubble and g stands for the gravity ﬁeld; ρL, ρG denote, respec-

tively, the mass densities of water and air. µL stands for the liquid’s viscosity. In order to

describe the ﬂow parameters of the bubble swarm, Eqs. (1) and (2) should be expressed

in terms of the volume fraction of bubbles (or void fraction) ε and their velocity ﬁeld v.

Following Ref. [10] we assume that the uniform ﬂow of bubbles is along the axial direction
of the column with a mean axial rise velocity v0(ε), Therefore, ε(z, t) ≡ 4

3πa3n(z, t).

The eﬀect of hydrodynamic interactions between the bubbles on the mean frictional force

may be represented by introducing a function f0(ε) into v0(ε) in the form v0(ε) = f −1

0 (ε)v∞,

[10]. The magnitude of the terminal velocity, v∞, of a single bubble of radius a in a stagnant
liquid is given by [16] v∞ ≡ C −1
D (ρL − ρG)g, where CD ≡ 9µL/a2 is the drag force factor and
experiments suggest that [14], f0(ε) = (1 − ε)−2. The mean ﬂuid impulse is modelled by

nIL = n

πa3ρL

m0(ε)v0(ε),

2
3

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(3)

where m0(ε) takes into account the eﬀect of the hydrodynamic interactions. According to

Ref.

[15] an expression for m0(ε) that renders reliable results up to large values of ε is

m0(ε) = (1 + 2ε)/(1 − ε).

Since in a nonuniform bubbly ﬂow the stress T = TG+ TL play the role of an eﬀective
pressure, they also assume that the kinetic contribution, pe(ε), is proportional to the eﬀective
density of the bubbles, ε−1ρef (ǫ) ≡ ρG + 1
ﬂuctuations ∆v2 ≡ H(ε)v2

2 ρLm0(ε), and to the mean square of their velocity
v2
0(ε), [16]. Here εcp stands for the limit of
(cid:17)
closest packaging of a set of spheres and is close to the value 0.62. Thus, pe(ε) = ρef ∆v2 .

0(ε) = ε
εcp

(cid:16)

Furthermore, if the non-uniformity is the main cause of an additional transfer of bubble

momentum and ﬂuid impulse associated with stress, Biesheuvel and Gorissen [10] postulate
that such a contribution to the stress should be given by the force µe(ε) ∂
∂z v. Therefore,
taking into account both contributions to the stress, T = −pe(ε) + µe(ε) ∂v
∂z , where v is the
one dimensional nonuniform ﬂow velocity and µe(ε) = aρef (ε)v0(ε)H 1/2(ε) is an eﬀective

viscosity.

On the other hand, the mean frictional force is enhanced by an eﬀective diﬀusive ﬂux

of bubbles due to their ﬂuctuating motion. This eﬀect is similar to an steady drag force

acting upon each one of the bubbles and proportional to the mean number density gradient.
Therefore, using (2) this force is represented by nFD = CDεf0(ε)[v + µe(ε)

∂ε
∂z ]. Substitution
(1) and (2) leads to the following closed set of one-

of the above expressions into Eqs.

These equations may be rewritten in a laboratory reference frame by considering the

UL are the mean bubble and ﬂuid axial velocity in the laboratory reference frame. Note that

due to the incompressibility of both, liquid and gas, U is only a function of time. Therefore

III. POLYDISPERSED DISPERSION

The method developed by Tam [9] uses the concept of randomness of the bubble cloud

and derives equations describing the average properties of the ﬂuid motion. These averages

are taken over a statistical ensemble of particle conﬁgurations. A slow viscous ﬂow past a

large collection of spheres of a given size distribution is considered to derive a particle drag

formula free from empirical assumptions. The result essentially replaces the disturbance

produced by a sphere in low Reynolds number ﬂow, by that of a point force located at the

centre of the sphere. The correction drag force factor is given by

in the polydispersed case v0(ε) should be replaced by vP

Since the terminal velocity of a bubble depends on CD, it is reasonable to assume that
0 ≡ λ−1v0. Substitution of this
asumption into Eqs. (6) - (8), carrying out the linearization procedure described in the last

section and using the explicit expressions of β ≡ {UG0, c0, c±, τε}, one can show that these
quantities scale as βp ≡ {λ−1UG0, λ−1c0, λ−1c±, λ−1τε}.

If these polydispersed quantities

are substituted into Eq. (12), one obtains an expression for the polydispersed gain factor

IV. RESULTS

To compare the monodisperesed and polydispersed results on the gain factor, mean bubble

velocity, kinematic wave velocities as a function of void fraction, we used the the following

parameter values for an air-water bubble column, ∆z = 20 cm, VT = 1280 cm3, ρG = 1.2046
× 10−3 gr/cm3, ρL = 0.998 gr/cm3, µL = 1.002 × 10−2poise, εcp = 0.62. In Fig. 1 we
plot Gf and Gp

f vs. ε for diﬀerent frequencies ω and for a log-normal distribution n(a) with

average and dispersion a = 0.04 cm, σ = 0.5, respectively.

Note that for values 0.185 6 ε 6 0.301 the attenuation rate drops signiﬁcantly for For

instance,the per cent diﬀerence deﬁned by Γ ≡

Gf − Gp

/Gf . For the range both cases. For

instance, for a frequency of 2Hz this diﬀerence ranges from 0.1 − 4.98 per cent, whereas for
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
a frequency of 3Hz it varies in the interval 0.1 − 22.78 per cent. This means that stability is

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

larger in about 23 per cent for the latter case, a change that is signiﬁcant in bubble reactors

[17].

The quantities β ≡ {UG0, c0, c±, τε} and βp ≡ {λ−1UG0, λ−1c0, λ−1c±} are plotted as
functions of ε in Fig. 2. The curve for c0 is always between that for c+p and c−p. According
to the Whitham stability criterion [19], when c0 < c− the uniform ﬂow is unstable. This

occurs for both distributions, however, for the monodispersed case it occurs for ε > 0.353,

whereas for the polydispersed case the system is stable up to a larger value of the void

fraction, e.g. ε > 0.36.

V. DISCUSSION

Summarizing, in this work we have analyzed the eﬀects of size polydispersity in several

features of the void fraction waves and their stability properties. We found that the presence

of a size distribution reinforces the stability of the waves, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

Furthermore, the per cent diﬀerence may be quantiﬁed by estimating Γ ≡ |β − βp| /β, Γ

amounts to a maximum percentual diﬀerence of 4.9%.

It is convenient to emphasize once again, that the hydrodynamic model used in this

work [10] is idealized in many aspects. For instance, compressibility and hydrodynamic

interactions between bubbles and with the boundaries, have not been taken into account.

However, given the complexity of these eﬀects and of the system itself, the simple dimensional

model proposed by Biesheuvel and Gorissen seems to be a good ﬁrst step in modeling the

complex behavior of a bubble column.

It also ilustrates how some of the methodology

and concepts of kinetic theory and statistical mechanics may be used to deal with complex

phenomena in engineering systems.

We should also mention that in this work we have assumed an initial polydisperse size

distribution and the coalescence of bubbles has not been considered [20]. however, this

9

remains to be assessed. Some other important eﬀects remain to be considered as well,

like the bubble-bubble interaction mechanisms.Nevertheless the approach followed here by

including the inﬂuence of the distribution through the drag eﬀects, considering a mean ﬁeld

approach,is an attempt to set a ﬁrst framework for the bubble size distribution incorporation

to further studies. Our results reinforce this point of view in the sense that a description of a

bubble column based on the concept of randomness of a bubble cloud and average properties

of the ﬂuid motion, may be a useful approach that has not been exploited in engineering

systems.

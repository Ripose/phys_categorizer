Equations of radial motion of a gas bubble in a compressible viscous liquid have been modiﬁed
to account for compressibility at the bubble boundary. It has been done by deriving a new bubble
boundary equation. This equation has a new term due to liquid compressibility. The inﬂuence of this
term in the bubble dynamics has been numerically investigated using isothermal-adiabatic model
for the gas bubble evolution. The results clearly indicate that at the end of the collapse the new
term has very signiﬁcant role and its consideration dramatically changes the bubble characteristics.
The eﬀect of this term is more prominent for the more intense collapses, so that its consideration
scales up the maximum values of gas pressure and gas temperature. We have also reasoned that
the new bubble behavior will be established even when the eﬀects of mass (water vapor) exchange,
chemical reactions, and gas dynamics inside the bubble are taken into account in the model.

INTRODUCTION

Pl, to the gas pressure inside the bubble as:

The problem of non-linear radial oscillations of a gas
bubble in a liquid, when it experiences a high amplitude
spherical sound ﬁeld, is an old challenging problem. Sev-
eral complications are present in the problem arising from
the eﬀects of heat conduction, mass diﬀusion, compress-
ibility, chemical reactions, surface tension and viscosity.
Many authors have reported diﬀerent aspects of the mat-
ter. However, a rather complete description has not been
presented yet.

The radial dynamics of a bubble in an incompress-
ible liquid is described by the well-known incompressible
Rayleigh-Plesset equation [1, 2]. The extension of this
equation to include acoustic radiation of the bubble to
the liquid has been studied by many authors; for example
Herring [3], Trilling [4], Gilmore [5], Keller and Kolodner
[6], Flynn [7], Lastman and Wentzell [8], L¨ofstedt et al.
[9], and Nigmatulin et al.
[10]. On the other hand, ef-
fects of heat conduction and mass diﬀusion in the bubble
motion have been presented in the works of Hickling [11],
Fujikawa and Akumatsu [12], and Yasui [13].

The modiﬁed form of Rayleigh-Plesset equation to in-
clude acoustic radiation of the bubble can be written as

where, Pg, µ, and σ are the gas pressure at the bubble in-
terface, liquid ﬁrst viscosity, and surface tension, respec-
tively. It must be mentioned that the diﬀerence of Eq’ns.
(1) and (2) with the other forms of the existing bubble
dynamics equations arises from the terms proportional
to ˙R/C. Prosperetti and Lezzi [16] showed that there
is a one-parameter family of equations which describes
the bubble motion in ﬁrst order approximation. Indeed,
diﬀerent forms of the existing Rayleigh-Plesset equations
belong to this single parameter family of equations, cor-
responding to diﬀerent values of the parameter.

Although Eq’n. (1) has been basically derived from the
Euler equation in which the liquid viscosity eﬀects have
been neglected, but these eﬀects are not important in the
usual applications of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.
It
can be shown [17] that these eﬀects are remarkable when
µ >
∼ ρCR0, where R0 is the ambient radius. Therefore,
for the micron size and larger bubbles their elimination
is thoroughly justiﬁed.

On the other hand, in the derivation of Eq’n. (2), it is
assumed that the liquid and the gas motions at the bub-
ble interface are incompressible. Indeed, only damping
feature of liquid viscosity appears in Eq’n. (2). Although
this equation has been widely used in the old and recent
works [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
but the applicability of it to the whole motion of the
bubble needs to be clariﬁed (especially at the end of the
collapse, where the bubble motion is signiﬁcantly com-
pressible).
It seems that the comparison of the order
of the eliminated terms, using this approximation, with
the remaining terms of Eq’n. (2) reasonably determines
validity of the approximation.

On the contrary to the already mentioned investiga-
tions, Keller and Miksis in their work [18] took into con-

sideration the liquid compressibility eﬀects in the normal
stress tensor at the bubble boundary. However, due to
their special approximations, they ﬁnally introduced an
equation which was not really diﬀerent from Eq’ns. (1)
and (2), regardless of some extra terms proportional to
˙R/C.

In this paper, Eq’n.

(2) has been modiﬁed by con-
sideration of all eﬀects of viscosity and compressibility
at the bubble interface for both the liquid and the gas.
The modiﬁed equation has new terms resulted from the
eﬀects of two coeﬃcients of viscosity of the liquid and
the gas. The inﬂuence of this modiﬁcation on the time
evolution of the bubble properties has been numerically
investigated.

II. COMPRESSIBLE BUBBLE BOUNDARY
CONDITION EQUATION

To derive the compressible bubble boundary condition
equation, we assume that the motions of the bubble inter-
face and surrounding liquid are always spherically sym-
metric. The continuity equation and the radial compo-
nent of the stress tensor can be written as:

where ρ, u, p, and ∆ are density, velocity, pressure, and
divergence of the velocity, respectively. Also, λ is second
coeﬃcient of viscosity. Inserting ∂u/∂r from Eq’n. (3),
into Eq’n. (4) yields:

and the gas. Also, µ and λ in Eq’n. (8) and in the follow-
ing equations denote the ﬁrst and the second coeﬃcients
of liquid viscosity. Substituting divergence of velocity for
the liquid and the gas from Eq’n (6) into Eq’n. (8) yields:

ison of Eq’ns (2) and (9) indicates the existence of three
new terms in Eq’n.
(9) due to the liquid and the gas
compressibility and viscosity. Note that Eq’ns (1) and
(9) are the modiﬁcation of the Rayleigh-Plesset equa-
tion that accounts for viscosity of a compressible liq-
uid. While, all previous equations have accounted for
viscosity of an incompressible liquid and compressibility,
separately. The new equations are two non-linear cou-
pled equations which cannot be merged into one equa-
tion unlike the all previous Rayleigh-Plesset equations.
Here, we concentrate on the eﬀects of the new term
arising from the liquid compressibility. Therefore, the
gas viscosity eﬀects are neglected as in previous works
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
for the sake of simplicity. Under this circumstance, Eq’n.

λ∗ = λ/ρR0C, and µ∗ = µ/ρR0C. These dimension-
less numbers are basically inverse of Weber Number and
inverse of Reynolds Number. Equations (12) and (13)
state that the inﬂuence of the surface tension and the
liquid viscosity in the bubble dynamics are characterized
by Weber Number and Reynolds Number of the problem.

[14, 15]. The driving pressure in its dimensionless form
was P ∗

angular frequency and is deﬁned as ωR0/C. To have
a well-posed problem, the value of the gas pressure at
the bubble interface, P ∗
It can be
determined, in the most complete approach, from the so-
lution of conservation equations for the bubble interior
(12) and (13) simultaneously. The
along with Eq’ns.
bubble content also undergoes chemical reactions at the
end of collapse.
In addition, mass exchange and heat
transfer between the bubble and surrounding liquid af-
fect the bubble interior. During ten years ago, several
diﬀerent approaches have been presented to describe the
real state of the gas and its evolution considering the
above-mentioned complexities. These approaches which
at ﬁrst were inviscid and without consideration of chem-
ical reactions, heat transfer, and mass exchange [19, 20]
became gradually more complex by including dissipating
eﬀects of radiative transfer [21], heat transfer, and vis-
cous gas dynamics [22, 23]. Recent gas dynamic model of
Storey and Szeri [24] accounts for all eﬀects of chemical
reactions and water vapor evaporation and condensation.
During the bubble motion spatial inhomogeneities in-
side the bubble are not remarkably revealed unless at
the end of the collapse. Therefore, uniformity assump-
tion for the bubble interior seems to be useful and provide
many features of the bubble motion [14, 15]. By this as-
sumption, gas pressure inside the bubble is obtained by
assuming polytropic evolution for the gas bubble:

ary condition in one period of the applied pressure ﬁeld.

where Van der Waals equation of state has been used
and a∗ is the dimensionless Van der Waals hard core ra-
dius; a∗ = a/R0. The bubble evolution is assumed to be
isothermal (γ = 1.0) for the radii larger than R0, when
the bubble moves relatively slowly. While, adiabatic as-
sumption (γ = Γ, Γ is the radio of the speciﬁc heats of the
bubble interior) is applied for the smaller radii, when the
bubble experiences rapid changes [14]. Hilgenfeldt et al.
[25] extended this model by considering γ to be a func-
tion of Peclet number of the bubble which changes by
variations of bubble radius and velocity. They showed
that many features of SBSL can be explained by their
model. However, in practice there is very small diﬀer-
ence (less than 5%) between Hilgenfeldt et al.’s model
and istheraml-adiabatic model [26, 27]. Although, these
two models can not illustrate production of the discon-
tinuities and shock waves at the end of the collapse, but
they are really useful for our purpose to investigate the
importance of new viscous term during the collapse. It
must be mentioned that these models have been used by
several recent works about sonoluminescence [35]. We
have used istheraml-adiabatic model in this paper. Also,
we have argued about extension of the results for the
more complicated models in the DISCUSSION section.

Under these circumstances, time variations of the bub-
ble properties have been numerically calculated for two
cases: (a) compressible boundary condition (Eq’n. 13)
and (b) incompressible boundary condition (Eq’n. 2).
We used Runge-Kutta method for the numerical analy-

culation were set for an air bubble in water at room
temperature, T0 = 293.0 oK, and atmosphere pres-

σ = 0.0728 Kgs−2, and Γ = 1.4. The second coeﬃ-
cient of viscosity of water was set to be λ = 2.23 µ. It
was derived from the value of bulk viscosity of water at
room temperature which is [30] µb = λ + (2µ/3) = 2.9µ.
Also, the angular frequency of the deriving pressure was
ω = 2π × 26.5 KHz.

IV. RESULTS

[32], and Vazquez et al.

The results of our calculations have been illustrated in
Figs. (1-5) for Pa = 1.6 atm and R0 = 2.0 µm. Similar
values for the parameters space are in the results of recent
experimental works of Ketterling and Apfel [31], Simon
et al.
[33]. Figure (1) shows
the variations of the bubble radius and the gas tempera-
ture in one period of the applied pressure ﬁeld according
to compressible boundary condition. The bubble mo-
tion has incompressible characteristics during a period,
except for an inﬁnitesimal time interval at the end of col-
lapse. Basically, the new viscous term of Eq’n. (13) has
been arisen from the compressibility of the liquid mo-
tion. Therefore, it is expected that its eﬀects not to be

revealed, until the bubble motion becomes signiﬁcantly
compressible. Results of our calculations clearly conﬁrm
this point. Except for the end of collapse, the diﬀer-
ences between the bubble characteristics resulting from
the compressible boundary condition and those of the
incompressible boundary condition are less than 1.0%.
This result thoroughly justiﬁes the elimination of the new
viscous term of Eq’n. (13) for all times, but not for the
end of collapse. Indeed, for the drawing scale of Fig. (1),
the curves obtained for the bubble properties of the two
boundary conditions completely coincide. However, the
maximum bubble temperature in Fig. 1(b) has a consid-
erable increase relative to that of the incompressible case.
This discrepancy instigated us for further concentration
on the bubble properties around the minimum radius.

In Figs. (2-4) we have presented the evolution of bub-
ble characteristics according to compressible boundary
condition (a), and incompressible boundary condition
(b), around the minimum radius time. The time inter-
val of these ﬁgures is nearly 37.7 psec. Since, the bubble
experiences its maximum compression at the end of the
collapse, the eﬀects of the new viscous term of Eq’n. (13)
are more manifest in this time interval.

Figure (2) shows the bubble radius evolution for the
two boundary condition equations. It illustrates a distin-
guishable diﬀerence between the bubble radius according
to compressible case and that of incompressible case. Af-
ter the bubble reaches to its minimum radius, a number
of small bouncing oscillations appear in the graph of the

new equations which are not occurred in that of the old
equations. The time interval between two successive ones
of these oscillations is nearly 2.5 psec. Details of our cal-
culations show that the times of minimum radius for the
two cases are the same. While, the minimum radius for
the new Eq’n. (13) has 2.3% decrease relative to that of
the old Eq’n. (2).

Figure (3) represents the time variations of gas temper-
ature near the minimum radius time. It evidently rep-
resents that introducing the new viscous term in Eq’n.
(13) strongly aﬀects the evolution of gas temperature at
the end of the collapse. After the minimum radius time,
the incompressible equation illustrates smooth behavior
for the bubble temperature. While, remarkable sharp
peaks appear on the temperature evolution according to
the compressible boundary condition. Also, as the bub-
ble goes away from the minimum radius, the peaks are
widen as they are weakened. Note that the value of max-
imum temperature has increased prominently (nearly 3.7
times) for the new equations relative to that of the old
ones.

Comparison of the gas pressure evolution for the two
boundary conditions is shown in Fig. (4). The similar
behavior as in Fig. (3) is observed in this ﬁgure for the
diﬀerence between the new and the old boundary condi-
tion equations. Note that the gas pressure is much more
sensitive to the presence of the new viscous term than
the gas temperature.
In fact, the presence of the new
term scales up the maximum pressure up to two orders

of magnitude.

In Fig. (5), the time variations of three pressure terms
in Eq’n. (13) have been illustrated near the minimum ra-
dius. These terms are due to the eﬀects of surface tension
and viscosity, i.e. Pσ = 2σ∗/R∗, Pµ = 4µ∗ ˙R∗/R∗, and
Pλµ = (λ∗ + 2µ∗)(dP ∗
l /dt∗). This ﬁgure clearly shows
that at the end of collapse, the collective eﬀects of the
viscous terms are by far greater than the surface tension
term. Moreover, the new viscous term, Pλµ, is the dom-
inant term of this time interval. The order of maximum
values of the three pressure terms are completely diﬀer-
ent. The most is for Pλµ (up to 103) and the least is
for Pσ (less than 10−2). These results emphasize on this
point that the elimination of Pλµ is not reasonable when
the bubble evolves near the minimum radius.

are for constant driving pressure amplitude Pa = 1.7 atm.
Other constants and parameters were set as Fig.1

Figures (6) and (7) illustrate the strong dependence
of the diﬀerence between the two boundary conditions
on the driving pressure and the ambient radius. Fig-
ure (6) is for the case that ambient radius is constant
(R0 = 1.5 µm), while the amplitude of the driving pres-
sure is increased from Pa = 1.4 atm to 1.8 atm. On
the other hand, ﬁgure (7) shows the states of aﬀair for
the case of constant amplitude of the driving pressure,
(Pa = 1.7 atm), with varying R0 from 1.0 µm to 5.0 µm.
The diﬀerent values of R0 can be experimentally adapted
to a speciﬁc value of Pa, by adjusting the concentration
of the dissolved gas in the liquid [14].

The dependence of the maximum pressure and max-
imum temperature of the bubble with respect to Pa is
represented in Fig. (6). There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between these bubble properties resulted from the new
boundary condition with those of the old one. The dif-
ferences are more considerable for the higher driving pres-
sures. Moreover, the diﬀerences are more remarkable for
the maximum pressure than the maximum temperature.
Note that for Pa = 1.8 atm, the maximum temperature
of the new equations is about 20 times greater than that
of the old ones. While, the increase of the maximum
pressure in this case is about 30000 times. These re-
sults indicate that the compressibility eﬀects should be

much higher than what is considered in the incompress-
ible boundary equation.

The eﬀects of the variation of R0 on the aforemen-
tioned bubble properties are illustrated in Fig. (7). Sim-
ilar impressive diﬀerences between the new and the old
boundary equations as in Fig.
(6) are also present in
this ﬁgure. The diﬀerences are more signiﬁcant for the
smaller ambient radii.

Time grid resolution study of the problem shows that
values of the bubble properties at the end of collapse are
sensitive to the step size value. But the sensitivity is re-
laxed as the resolution is reduced enough. Figure (8),
presents the state of aﬀair for the value of maximum gas
pressure according to the compressible boundary condi-
tion for Pa = 1.8 atm and R0 = 1.5 µm.
It shows a
diminishing step size dependence bellow 10−17 sec.

It must be mentioned that, although the results of last
ﬁgures were acquired by assumption that Γ = 1.4 (the
bubble content was assumed to be a diatomic gas), how-
ever appearance of the new bubble behavior is indepen-
dent of selected value of Γ (and gas content). Figure (9)
shows evolution of the bubble temperature for two dif-
ferent states; Γ = 1.67 (monoatomic gas) and Γ = 1.33
(polyatomic gas). Comparison of Figs. (3) and (9) shows
that the new bubble behavior will be established even

7

argue about the inﬂuences of each one of these corrections
on the new bubble behavior:

(i) Gas dynamics: Considerations of gas dynamics eﬀects
inside the bubble have been presented by several diﬀerent
approaches [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. These approaches shows
that overall bubble temperature and pressure at the col-
lapse in gas dynamics models are at least no less than
those of the isothermal-adiabatic model. In fact, in the
gas dynamics models the bubble experiences more com-
pression. Therefore, the pressure upon the liquid will be
greater in the gas dynamic models. This means that the
eﬀects of new viscous term even can be more remarkable
in the gas dynamics models.

(ii) Chemical reactions: The temperature of the bubble
at the end of the collapse is so high (higher than 10000 K)
to destroy the chemical bonds of N2 and O2 molecules of
the air bubble. Chemical reactions between water vapor
and oxygen and nitrogen atoms produce mainly very sol-
uble substances in water (HN, NH3, and HNO3) which
are completely absorbed in the water. Therefore, a sono-
luminescence air bubble contains mainly inert gas. This
idea which was initially presented by Lohse et al. [34] is
known as dissociation hypothesis (DH) and has been con-
ﬁrmed very well by the experimental reports [35]. Sim-
ulation of chemical reactions at the collapse in a gas dy-
namics model has been recently presented by Storey and
Szeri [24]. The results of this work show that a consid-
erable decrease appears in the bubble peak temperature
due to consideration of chemical reactions. Since most
of the reactions at the collapse are endothermic, their
inﬂuences can be considered as addition of some extra
degrees of freedom [15]. This means that the bubble ac-
tually evolves near the minimum radius by an eﬀective
exponent, Γeff, which is less than the monoatomic expo-
nent (Γ = 1.4). However, according to our results in last
section, appearance of the new behaviors is independent
of the values of Γ. Therefore, the new bubble behav-
iors should be established even when chemical reactions
eﬀects are introduced in the model.

(ii) Water vapor : Evaporation and condensation of the
water vapor between the bubble and the liquid occur dur-
ing the expansion and compression of the bubble. Recent
simulations of this matter [13, 24, 36] show that a large
amount of water vapor evaporates into the bubble during
the expansion. Indeed, at maximum radius about 90%
of the bubble content is water vapor. During the col-
lapse, the water vapor molecules condense to the liquid
so that near the minimum radius only a small fraction of
a sonoluminescence bubble is water vapor and the remain
is inert gas [13, 24, 36]. Presence of these water vapor
molecules inside the bubble decreases the maximum tem-
perature due to increase of the bubble’s total degrees of
freedom. This eﬀect can be considered as a more decrease
of the eﬀective exponent [15]. Therefore, similar to our
argument in the last part, the eﬀects of water vapor can
not also quench the strong eﬀects of compressibility con-
sideration of this paper.

gas pressure according to the compressible equation for Pa =
1.8 atm and R0 = 1.5 µm.

FIG. 9: Dependence of the gas temperature evolution near the
minimum radius to the value of Γ, according to compressible
(thick) and incompressible boundary conditions (thin). The
dashed and solid curves are related to Γ = 1.33 and Γ = 1.67,
respectively. Time interval of this ﬁgure is 50 psec around the
minimum radius time (tmin). Other constant and parameters
are the same as Fig. 1. Note that tmin for Γ = 1.33 is nearly
one picosecond less than that of Γ = 1.67.

when the gas content changes. Of course, as Figs. (3)
and (9) indicates conﬁguration and the number of new
peaks depend on the value of Γ. For smaller Γ, the num-
ber of peaks is more. While, the values of peak temper-
atures are greater for higher Γ, due to decrease of the
number of gas content degrees of freedom.

V. DISCUSSION

Although, isothermal-adiabatic model used in this pa-
per does not account for eﬀects of gas dynamics, chemical
reactions and water vapor exchange, but consideration of
these eﬀects can not cover the importance of new bubble
behavior at the end of the collapse. In the following, we

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The modiﬁcation of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation to
account for viscosity of a compressible liquid was done by
deriving a new equation for the bubble boundary. This
equation includes a new term, which has been resulted
from simultaneous eﬀects of viscosity and compressibil-
ity of the liquid. The new term is the prominent term at
the end of the collapse, where the bubble is highly com-
pressed. This new term exhibits its role by intensifying
the strength of the collapse up to scaling up the max-
imum gas temperature and the maximum gas pressure.
Also, the more intense the collapse is, the more signiﬁcant
is the role of the new term. Also, the new eﬀects are so
strong that can not be completely quenched by the dissi-
pating eﬀects of water vapor and chemical reactions. The
results of this work evidently indicate that, the neglect of
the new term at the end of the collapse in the previously

derived equations is not reasonable. Especially, it is more
remarkable for high amplitudes single bubble sonolumi-
nescecne. It is expected that the new theoretical results
of this paper can be conﬁrmed by the experiment, if res-
olution of the bubble motion measuring at the end of an
enough intense collapse be less than 0.1 nsec. Of course,
a stable high amplitude sonoluminescence bubble can be
produced if concentration of dissolved gas in the liquid
be suﬃciently small [32].

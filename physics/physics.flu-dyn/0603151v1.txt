The averaged dynamics of various two-phase systems in a high-frequency vibration ﬁeld is studied
theoretically. The continuum approach is applied to describe such systems as solid particle suspen-
sions, emulsions, bubbly ﬂuids, when the volume concentration of the disperse phase is small and
gravity is insigniﬁcant. The dynamics of the disperse system is considered by means of the method
of averaging, when the fast pulsation and slow averaged motion can be treated separately. Two
averaged models for both nondeformable and deformable particles, when the compressibility of the
disperse phase becomes important, are obtained. A criterion when the compressibility of bubbles
cannot be neglected is ﬁgured out. For both cases the developed models are applied to study the
averaged dynamics of the disperse media in an inﬁnite plane layer under the action of transversal
vibration.

INTRODUCTION

Oscillatory processes can be found in a sheer uncount-
able number of situations in nature at various time and
length scales: from subatomic to astronomic scales. Vi-
bration is a mechanical oscillatory process with an am-
plitude small compared to the characteristic length scale
of the system. Often, as in our study, it is assumed that
the inherent time scale of the system is much larger than
the period of the oscillation. Vibration mechanics has
been studied for a long time, general concepts of this
nonlinear phenomenon have been put into practice.
It
is widely used in industry for transportation and separa-
tion of granular matter such as powders and grains, to
enhance mixing and reaction rates of diﬀerent species.
In medicine, ultrasound is applied for diagnostics and
healing.
In microﬂuidics and biotechnology it serves
as a means to manipulate physical (colloidal particles,
ﬁne-dispersed powders, liquid drops in microemulsions)
and biological objects (cells, microorganisms, and micro-
molecules) suspended in liquids. Quite a broad spectrum
of applications have motivated a great interest in the fun-
damental problems of vibration dynamics. The present
work is aimed at studying the dynamics of two-phase me-
dia in a high-frequency vibration ﬁeld.

There has been much eﬀort to understand the impact
of vibration action on the behavior of systems of diﬀer-
ent nature. Particularly, it has been understood that
vibration can substantially inﬂuence the dynamic and
rheologic properties of systems. An outstanding exam-
ple is the Kapitza pendulum with a periodically mov-

ing point of support,1 where the upper vertical state
of the pendulum becomes stable. Other known eﬀects
are a metal ball that lifts in ambient sand medium
under vibration,2 granular matter that liquidizes3 or
demonstrates the formation of oscillons4 in a vibration
ﬁeld. As typical hydrodynamic examples we mention
excitation of a steady relief at the oscillating interface
pure liquid–particle suspension,5,6 and thermal vibration
convection,7 where the action of vibration on the nonuni-
form ﬂuid results in generation of a slow macroscopic
motion even in the absence of gravity.

The behavior of a single solid inclusion in ﬂuid environ-
ment under vibration has attracted much attention since
long time ago. As far back as 1831, Faraday used par-
ticles to visualize standing acoustic waves and observed
the eﬀect of particle localization in the acoustic ﬁeld.8
The dynamics of a solid particle suspended in a verti-
cally oscillating ﬂuid was studied in Ref. 9. It was shown
that vibration results in an average force, which can be
used to aﬀect particle dynamics. Granat10 considered
theoretically a motion of a solid sphere in a periodically
oscillating ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid. For the ﬂuid with the
density higher than that of the sphere, the latter oscil-
lates with a smaller amplitude and a lag in phase. Con-
versely, in a relatively less dense ﬂuid the oscillation of
the sphere occurs with a larger amplitude with respect
to the ﬂow and leads in phase. In an experimental study
by Chelomey,11 the behavior of solid bodies in a verti-
cally vibrated vessel with a ﬂuid was investigated. It was
observed that under vibration action, bodies with higher
than ambient density could rise to the surface, whereas
light bodies could sink. Theoretically, the averaged be-
havior of a solid sphere suspended in oscillated ﬂuid near
a wall was discussed in Ref. 12 and has been recently
generalized.13,14 It has been demonstrated that in addi-
tion to the gravity and Archemedian forces there appears

an averaged force that attracts the body to the wall due
to vibration. This vibration force can lead to ascent of
heavy or settling down of light bodies, as was observed
experimentally.11

The dynamics of a single compressible bubble in vibra-
tion ﬁelds has been studied by many authors. The ﬁrst
analysis of the bubble dynamics was made by Rayleigh15
(see also Ref. 12). A nonlinear equation that relates
the radius of a bubble to the pressure in the liquid at
large distance from the bubble, known as the Rayleigh-
Plesset or Rayleigh-Lamb equation, was obtained and
the eigenfrequencies of the small oscillations were deter-
mined. Since then, many important aspects of nonlin-
ear bubble dynamics and cavitation has been studied,
e.g., natural and forced oscillations, parametric insta-
bility, which causes the oscillation of the bubble shape
against a background of spherical pulsation, the inﬂuence
of heat exchange between bubbles and ambient ﬂuid and
nonideality of the gas ﬁlling the bubble, the behavior of
bubbles in nonuniform ﬂows (see reviews in Refs. 16,17).
In the context of the time-averaged dynamics of a bub-
ble an important problem is obtaining the force exerted
on the bubble due to vibration. The behavior of a single
bubble in a standing acoustic wave is determined by “the
primary Bjerknes force” after Bjerknes,18 who proposed
its qualitative explanation. The eﬀect is quite general:
the bubbles migrate to the nodes of the pressure wave at
high frequencies ω > ω0 and to antinodes at low frequen-
cies ω < ω0, where ω0 is the frequency of natural oscilla-
tion of the bubble. The average force on a particle, called
the force of radiation pressure, was obtained by Yosioka
and Kawasima.19 The considered setup comprised a liq-
uid drop in another liquid in a standing acoustic wave,
where both liquids were assumed to be compressible. A
generalization for the case of an arbitrary nonuniform
oscillating ﬂow has been provided by Alekseev.20 These
results can be applied to analyze both limiting cases –
the primary Bjerknes eﬀect for deformable bubbles and
the behavior of a solid particle in nonuniform pulsating
ﬂows.

Generalization of the description of a separate particle
suspended in a ﬂuid to the case of a disperse medium (en-
semble of many particles) requires space averaging. The
precise description of all the disperse particles becomes
redundant and unfeasible. There are basically three pos-
sibilities to obtain a reasonable model: (i) statistical ap-
proach, concerned with averaging over the ensemble of
particles; for solid particles and bubbles such a proce-
dure is carried out in Refs. 21,22,23; (ii) derivation of
a kinetic equation (see, e.g., Refs. 24,25,26); (iii) contin-
uum models, where after the space-averaging the disperse
particles are treated as a separate continuum.27,28 In our
study, we apply the last approach.

Although, wave propagation in disperse media is well
understood, the problem of the time-averaged dynam-
ics for such systems has received relatively little atten-
tion and remains rather unexplored. Most of studies
deal with acoustic vibration, when the compressibility

2

of carrier ﬂuid is of crucial importance; the feedback of
particles on the ﬂow is conventionally neglected. For in-
stance, Ganiev and Lapchinsky29 studied averaged col-
lective behavior of bubbles and solid particles suspended
in ﬂuids in acoustic ﬁelds. The analog of the primary
Bjerknes eﬀect was observed and simple explanation was
In the present study, we concentrate on the

averaged eﬀects in various disperse media under the ac-
tion of high frequency, but subacoustic vibration ﬁeld,
i.e., when the ﬂuid is incompressible. We also take into
account the feedback of particles on the carrier ﬂuid and
demonstrate that this is an important factor, which can
lead to nontrivial eﬀects.

The paper is outlined as follows. In Sec. II the the-
oretical model is developed for a suspension of nonde-
formable particles. The equations describing the pulsa-
tion and averaged dynamics are obtained. On the basis
of this model the stability of a quasi-equilibrium state in
a plane layer is analyzed in Sec. III. Section IV addresses
the vibrational dynamics of bubbly ﬂuids. An averaged
model accounting for the compressibility of bubbles is ob-
tained. Particularly, it is shown that in the limit of weak
compressibility this model reduces to the model for non-
deformable particles, obtained in Sec. II. In Sec. V, the
developed model is applied to investigate the dynamics
of a bubbly ﬂuid in a plane layer under vibration action.
The results are summarized in Sec. VI.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL OF A
NONDEFORMABLE PARTICLE SUSPENSION
IN A VIBRATION FIELD

A. Governing equations and basic assumptions

≪

Consider the behavior of an isothermal ﬂuid (liquid or
gas) laden with disperse particles (solid particles, small
droplets of another liquid or bubbles) under the action
of high frequency vibration. We assume that all the
particles are monodisperse spheres of a radius rd and
the amplitude of vibration a is small compared to this
rd (for viscous pulsation a milder restriction
size: a
is enough to be held, see Sec. II B). The frequency of
vibration ω is assumed to be so high that the size of a
viscous boundary layer ℓ =
ν/ω (ν is the kinematic
viscosity of the ﬂuid) near the walls of a container with
the suspension is small with respect to the characteristic
scale L of a ﬂow. On the other hand, the scale L is con-
sidered to be small compared to the acoustic wave length
λa = 2πva/ω (va is the acoustic sound), which leads to a
twofold inequality ν/L2
ω

va/L.

p

We start with a two-ﬂuid model valid for dilute sus-
pensions, when one can neglect interparticle interactions
and interactions between the particles and walls of a
container. We assume that the size rd is large enough
to neglect diﬀusion of particles, but small with respect
to L. On a scale much greater than rd the particles
are regarded as a continuum with the volume fraction

≪

ϕ = 4/3πr3
dn (the volume fraction of the ﬂuid phase is
1
ϕ), where n is the number of particles per unit volume
of the medium. It is also supposed that the particles can
neither deform nor combine into agglomerates; the car-
rier and the disperse phases have constant densities ρ and
ρd (hereafter, the subscript “d” stands for the disperse
phase). Since ϕ diﬀers from n by a constant factor, in
the following ϕ is called concentration. After averaging
over space the equations for mass and momentum of the
phases read:28

Here, the relative velocity of phases W = Ud
U and
the ratio of viscosities of phases κ = µd/µ are introduced.
The ﬁrst term in (3) is a force due to pressure gradient,
the next forces are the Stokes (Hadamard-Rybczynski)
drag,12 and three unsteady forces: the Basset history
force, the added mass force, allowing for the inertia of
the surrounding ﬂuid, and a second memory force that
is essential for non-solid particles.31 We do not consider
the eﬀects that can be initiated by rotation of particles,
therefore the Magnus force is not taken into account.

The relative contribution of the Stokes drag FS, the
Basset FB, and the added mass FM forces to the inter-
phase force (3) is governed by an “unsteadiness parame-
ter” K = rd/√νt∗:

FB
FS ∼

FM

where t∗ is the timescale of the variation of the relative
velocity of phases. Note, that the pressure gradient term
and the added mass force in (3) are of the same order.
The same argument can be applied to the memory forces,
except for the limiting cases of an inviscid bubble (κ = 0)
and a solid particle (κ
1), when, either the Basset term
≫
or the second memory force vanish, respectively.

For quasi-steady ﬂows (K

with ﬁnite K, the result (3) holds provided that the par-
ticle Reynolds number Red is small and gradients of the
velocity U are not too large:30

In the case of substantially unsteady ﬂows (K

force (3) has inviscid nature and the validity criterion
does not depend on the viscosity. The restrictions (4)
should be replaced with the conditions

rd ≪

which arise from linearization requirements. Note, that
in this limit, Red is not necessarily small and for ﬁnite
and large Red the forces depending on viscosity in ex-
pression (3) have to be modiﬁed.32 However, for the ﬂow
with K
1, these terms (irrespective of the modiﬁca-
tion) are small compared to the leading pressure gradient
and added mass forces and therefore can be neglected.

≫

The governing equations are formulated in an iner-
tial reference frame; the inﬂuence of vibration should be
taken into account through boundary conditions.

B. Pulsation velocities

The presence of two considerably diﬀerent time scales,
namely, the characteristic oscillation time 1/ω and the
dissipative time scale L2/ν, makes reasonable to use the
multiscale technique:34 the “fast” and the “slow” aver-
aged motions are treated separately. So, the operator of
time diﬀerentiation is replaced by a sum of two operators
∂/∂t
ω ∂/∂τ + ∂/∂t, where τ = ωt is the fast time; the
actual ﬁelds of the velocities, the pressure, and the con-
centration are represented by sums of the averaged (over
the fast time τ ) and the fast, or pulsation, components,
respectively: U = u + V, Ud = ud + Vd, P = p + q,
ϕ = c + φ.

→

∼

Let us substitute this ansatz into the governing equa-
tions and obtain the pulsation parts of the momentum
Eqs.
(2). We retain only the leading terms and take
into account a smallness of the concentration pulsation,
φ
(a/L)c, which follows from Eq. (1b). The dimension-
less variables are introduced using the following units:
1/ω and L2/ν for the fast and the averaged time, aω
and ν/L for the pulsation and the averaged velocities
of the phases, ρaω2L and ρν2/L2 for the pulsation and
the averaged pressure, respectively. It is assumed that
the space derivatives can be evaluated with the scale L,
which means that the small scale dynamics in boundary
layers near solid walls and turbulent pulsations are not
considered. As a result, we arrive at the equations for
the fast dynamics:

component of the memory force Fm is denoted by fm. For
the case of pulsation motion, the unsteadyness parameter
K = rd/ℓ has the meaning of the ratio of the particle
radius to the size of a viscous boundary layer around it.
The restrictions for the amplitude of vibration a are
imposed by the inequalities (4), (5), and the necessity of
linearization of the pulsation problem (6)-(8). For the

and carrier ﬂuid.

≫

Now restrict our theory to the case of a closed non-
deformable cavity, ﬁlled entirely with the two-phase
medium. Equations (11) should be supplemented with
the boundary conditions. The smallness of the vibration
amplitude allows us to prescribe the boundary conditions
at the average position. Because of incompressibility of
the medium, the normal component of the velocity v has
to coincide with that of the boundary velocity ξ at every
point of the boundary Γ:

n

Γ = n

·

ξ,

(15)

where n is the unit normal to the average position of the
boundary.

Assume that the system is subjected to translational,
linearly polarized vibration. In this case the boundary
velocity of the cavity is a constant vector: ξ = j (j is the
unit vector aligned along the vibration axis).

Since the particle concentration is small, the solution
to the pulsation problem (11), (15) is sought as a series
in c: v = v0 + v1 + . . . with v1
c (and analogously for
ˆV, ˆVd). Then, to the leading order we obtain

∼

v0 = ˆV0 = j,

(16)

i.e., the pulsation ﬁeld is constant in the entire cavity:
uniform ﬂuid moves together with the cavity as a solid.
Hence, to this approximation, the vibration does not in-
ﬂuence the system, therefore it is necessary to obtain a
nonuniform correction to the pulsation ﬁeld.

Taking into account Eqs. (11), (15) and the result (16),

to the next order we arrive at a problem

where S1 is a coeﬃcient in a corresponding expansion of
(12): S = 1+S1 c+O(c2). It becomes clear from Eq. (17),
that a nonuniformity of the pulsation ﬁeld v1 is caused
by interaction of vibration with inhomogenieties in the
particle concentration. We make a note, that an explicit
solution for the ﬁeld v1 is not needed while obtaining
the averaged equations of motion: only the vorticity and
divergency of v1 are further used.

C. Averaged equations. Single-ﬂuid approximation

We now turn to averaging of the governing equations.
Let us write out the averaged parts of Eqs. (1), (2) and
retain only the leading terms. Note, that averaged dy-
namics can be described in terms of a single-ﬂuid model.
Contrastingly to the pulsation motion, relative contri-
butions of the Stokes drag, the memory forces, and the
added mass force to the averaged dynamics are deﬁned
by a small parameter rd/L; the unsteady forces turn out
to be small compared with the Stokes force and there-
fore can be neglected. Because the diﬀerence in the av-
d/L2,
eraged velocities of the phases ud
we neglect it everywhere, except for the interphase force.
In the latter, this diﬀerence must be retained: despite
its smallness, it is multiplied by a vibration parameter
˜Rv = a2ω2L2/ν2, which can be large, and a correspond-
ing contribution in the averaged equations is generally
ﬁnite. As a result, we obtain the following equation of
motion

Here, ε is the averaged shear rate tensor; overlines are
used to denote averaging over time. The accepted ap-
proximation means, that the particles are “frozen” in the
averaged carrier ﬂow.

It is important to note, that the nonuniformity of the
pulsation ﬁeld can be caused not only by the considered
mechanism, when vibration interacts with nonuniformity
of the medium due to admixture. Another reason for a
nonuniformity in the pulsation ﬁeld is interaction of vi-
bration with the vorticity of the averaged ﬂow. A contri-
bution to the averaged equations due to the second mech-
anism is deﬁned by the vector of pulsation transport (see
discussion in Ref. 7). However, for the linearly polarized
vibration, the case under consideration, this vector van-
ishes. A quite similar situation takes place in thermal
vibrational convection.7 The only diﬀerence is that there
the nonuniformity of density is caused by nonisothermal-
ity of ﬂuid, but not due to the presence of a disperse
phase.

eration.

glect the nonuniformities of the density everywhere ex-
cept for the the vibration force, where the small con-
centration is multiplied by the vibration parameter ˜Rv,
which is generally large. Such a transformation corre-
sponds to a limiting transition, when ˜Rv

but their product ˜Rvc∗ is ﬁnite (here c∗ is the reference
value of the particle concentration).

Averaging of the mass balance equations is straight-

where Π is the renormalized pressure, the concentration
is normalized by c∗, and the vibration parameter is rede-
ﬁned Rv = a2ω2L2Bc∗/ν2.

The vibration force, appeared as a result of averag-
ing of the equations,
is caused by interaction of the
monochromatic linearly polarized vibration with the in-
homogeneity of medium due to a nonuniform distribu-
tion of particles; for the uniform distribution of particles
it vanishes. The force is directed along the vibration
axis and takes on maximal values in the domains of the
ﬂow where the gradient of particle concentration coin-
cides with the direction of the vibration axis. For the
initial state with a nonuniform distribution of particles
and the vanishing averaged velocity the action of the vi-
bration force can result in generation of averaged motion.
It is important to make a note of the generic character
of the vibration force. The dependence on the parame-
ters δ, κ, K, i.e., on the the nature of the particles, is
gathered in the parameter B. This allows us to make
two conclusions. First, since B > 0 for all values of these
parameters, the direction of the force is determined only
by the concentration ﬁeld and an orientation of the vi-
bration axis. Second, for diﬀerent media only the inten-
sity of response towards vibration action changes. How-
ever, such a quantitative distinction is worth discussing
for comparison with experiments, therefore properties of
the function B = B(δ, κ, K) are discussed in Appendix.
The set of averaged Eqs. (22), (23) must be supple-
mented with boundary conditions for the velocity. For
the considered case of vibration action, the Schlichting
mechanism35 of surface generation of averaged ﬂow is
absent, therefore on a rigid surface Γ one should use the
conventional no-slip boundary condition

sidered bulk mechanism, which is governed by the pa-
rameter Rv, the Schlichting mechanism can give a ﬁnite
contribution to generation of averaged motion only if the
leading part of the pulsation velocity is nonuniform. In
our case, this requirement is not satisﬁed: according to
(16), the leading part of the pulsation velocity is uni-
form, a nonuniformity occurs only as a small correction
to the uniform term. Hence, the Schlichting generation of
averaged ﬂow is negligible compared to the contribution
of the bulk mechanism. Rather similar situation takes
place in thermal vibration convection: for the same kind
of vibration action on weakly nonuniform ﬂuid, when the
density nonuniformity is caused by nonisothermality of
ﬂuid, the Schlichting mechanism does not contribute to
generation of average ﬂow.

III. STABILITY OF A QUASI-EQUILIBRIUM IN
VIBRATION FIELD

A. Basic quasi-equilibrium state

Let a suspension ﬁll an inﬁnite plane layer

1 < z < 1
(of a dimensional width 2h) in weightlessness. Consider
the inﬂuence of the transversal linearly polarized vibra-
tion on the stability of a quasi-equilibrium. A quasi-
equilibrium is thought of as a state in which the aver-
aged velocity vanishes in the entire volume of the system,
whereas the pulsation velocity is diﬀerent from zero.

−

This problem is described by Eqs. (22), (23) with j =
(0, 0, 1) and boundary conditions (24). By setting u = 0
in the equations, we obtain the conditions deﬁning the
quasi-equilibrium state

a condition

Rvc0(x, y, z) = Π0(z) + f (x, y).

(25)

Here f (x, y) is an arbitrary function of longitudinal coor-
dinates. Thus, there is a set of possible quasi-equilibrium
distributions of particles that is deﬁned by a sum of a
function of only transversal coordinate and a function of
longitudinal coordinates.

As a quasi-equilibrium concentration we choose a lin-

ear function of the transversal coordinate

(26)

and investigate its stability. Although gravity is unim-
portant in the framework of our theory, in a quiescent
ﬂuid (in the absence of vibration) it ultimately leads to
stratiﬁcation of particles. For this reason, the choice of
the initial distribution of particles in the form (26) is
rather natural for a narrow layer. Further, as a reference
value for the particle concentration we use βh, therefore
Rv = a2ω2h3Bβ/ν2.

B. Statement of linear stability problem

To investigate the stability of the quasi-equilibrium
state we introduce perturbations of the velocity u, the
pressure q, and the concentration φ , and substitute
the disturbed ﬁelds u, Π0 + q, c0 + φ into the prob-
lem (22)-(24). We linearize the equations near the quasi-
equilibrium and obtain a set of equations and boundary
conditions for small perturbations

Since the quasi-equilibrium state is uniform and
isotropic in a plane of the layer, we can restrict our stabil-
ity analysis to the case of the two-dimensional perturba-
tions in the form of rolls. Assuming all the perturbations
iky), where λ = λr + iλi
to be proportional to exp(λt

ber, we rewrite the problem for one variable. Eliminating
the pressure from the equation of motion and taking into
account the continuity equation, we obtain for the ampli-
tude ˆφ of the concentration perturbation (the perturba-
tions of the concentration and the transversal component
of the velocity diﬀer only by a constant factor):

where a diﬀerential operator D2 = d2/dz2

= 0. In the opposite case, λ = 0, there exist obvious
λ
solutions ˆφ = const for k
= 0 and ˆφ = ˆφ(z) for kRv = 0;
the perturbations of the velocity vanish for both these
cases. The existence of these neutrally stable solutions is
easy to explain: although the mentioned perturbations
deform the concentration ﬁeld (26), it still belongs to the
set of quasi-equilibrium solutions (25).

The boundary value problem (27), (28) is a spectral
amplitude problem, the condition of nontrivial solution
deﬁnes the growth rate λ as a function of parameters
Rv, k.
In the absence of vibration (Rv = 0), besides
the discussed solutions for λ = 0, the problem admits
an explicit solution,36 eigenvalues of which belong to a
spectrum of real negative values: all the perturbations
decay and the system is stable. Further we are interested
in the nontrivial case of Rv
= 0. In this case the problem
(27), (28) is no longer self-adjoint, therefore the spectrum
of growth rates can be complex.

Because the parameter β is not of the ﬁxed sign, the vi-
bration parameter can take on both positive and negative
values. However, the problem is invariant with respect to
the mutual change of sign of the transversal coordinate
and the vibration parameter. Such a symmetry is caused
by the absence of gravity, which allows us to restrict our
analysis to the case Rv > 0.

lyzed by the Galerkin method with a basis given by the
eigenfunctions36 of the problem (27), (28) at Rv = 0,
λ
= 0. Next, the behavior of the mode with the largest
λr was speciﬁed by the standard shooting method.37 It
was found that in all the range of the parameters k and
Rv > 0 there exists a growth rate with the positive real
part λr > 0: the system turns out to be unstable for any
intensity of vibration action. The real part of the growth
rate as a function of the wave number (the branch with
the maximal λr) is plotted in Fig. 1 for diﬀerent values
of vibration parameter Rv. For any value of the vibra-
tion parameter Rv the real part of the growth rate λr
has a maximum at some value k∗ of the wave number.
This critical value k∗ deﬁnes the perturbation with the
fastest growth rate, which dependence on the vibration
parameter is given in Fig. 2. At small values of Rv the
curve is outgoing from a point with a ﬁnite value of k∗.

generation of the averaged ﬂuid motion, which, in its
turn, deforms the initial distribution of particles.

IV. AVERAGED DYNAMICS OF A BUBBLY
FLUID

A. Basic equations

So far, the disperse phase was assumed to be nonde-
formable. However, the description of a bubbly ﬂuid in
vibration ﬁeld requires a closer look. The presence of the
disperse phase that is able to change its volume under
the action of an external periodic ﬁeld, can drastically
inﬂuence the pulsation and the averaged dynamics of the

system. Next, the case of a monodisperse bubbly ﬂuid
is studied and the criterion when compressibility of the
disperse phase cannot be neglected is provided. Assum-
ing the concentration ϕ of bubbles to be small, we formu-
late the equations for the momentum of the liquid carrier
phase and the bubbles (2) together with (3), where for
our particular consideration κ = 0. An essential modi-
ﬁcation that has to be taken into account here concerns
an additional contribution to the interphase force28

of a bubble (ℓ
Indeed, in the frames of the accepted approximation the
leading contribution to the pulsation motion is made by
the inertia forces [the ﬁrst and the fourth terms in (3)],
whereas for the averaged motion the Stokes force and
Fc are dominant. We suppose the density of the gaseous
phase to be much smaller than the density of the ﬂuid and
neglect the left-hand side in Eq. (2b), i.e., the force on the
bubbles vanishes. The equations deﬁning the kinematics

the pulsation (depending on the fast time τ ) and the
averaged parts. The notation and units for the pulsation
and averaged components of the velocities, the pressure,
and the concentration are the same as used before, in
Sec. II. Hereafter, b is the pulsation velocity of radial
motion.

B. Pulsation motion

Consider vibration of a cavity entirely ﬁlled with a bub-
bly ﬂuid. The principal assumptions introduced in Sec. II
are kept the same: the carrier phase is incompressible,
the frequency of vibration is high, but subacoustic, the
size of bubbles and the vibration amplitude are small.
On the other hand, we impose stronger restrictions for
the amplitude a and the frequency ω of vibration:

R2, ω

(39)

where χ and χd are the thermal diﬀusivities of the phases.
The second inequality implies that dissipation is unim-
portant for the pulsation motion, therefore the pressure
oscillation of gas obeys an adiabatic law.

Let us now formulate the equations for the pulsation
motion. The units for the pulsation velocity and the pres-
sure are kept the same as earlier (see Sec. II B), as a unit
for the velocity of the radial motion we choose aωL/R.
The equation for the pulsation of the concentration φ
splits oﬀ and can be treated separately. For this ﬁeld we

As it follows from Eq. (40), the pulsation of the concen-
tration is small compared to the averaged ﬁeld c. Note,
that the second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (40)
is, generally, much smaller than the ﬁrst one. However,
under certain conditions it becomes non-negligible (see
Sec. IV D).

It is convenient to write down the equations for the
remaining pulsation ﬁelds in terms of amplitudes. As-
suming that all the ﬁelds are proportional to exp iτ , we
obtain

Here, Ω is the ratio of the eigenfrequency of the volume
oscillation of a bubble to the frequency of vibration ω,

the parameter γ is the adiabatic exponent, and Pg is the
averaged pressure inside a bubble. Note the known rela-
tion between the velocities of the phases in a vibration
ﬁeld:39 the amplitude of oscillation of a bubble in an in-
viscid ﬂuid is three times as much as the that of the ﬂuid.
Equation (42) contains a product of two asymptotic
parameters: large l2 and small c. Depending on the rela-
tion between these parameters, diﬀerent solutions to the
pulsation problem are possible. Let us introduce a renor-
malized concentration Φ(r) = l2c (r). Assuming that this
ﬁeld is ﬁnite,40 we obtain a Helmholtz equation for a
potential ψ of the ﬂuid velocity and the impermeability

Equation (44) has a form of the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation, in which the role of the scattering potential is
played by the averaged concentration ﬁeld Φ(r) – the
waves are scattered on the nonuniformities of the bubble
distribution. The impermeability condition (45) should

be imposed on the volume-weighted velocity (1

small term 2c ˆV. Note that as the frequency Ω gets closer
to a resonant value Ω = 1, the susceptibility of the system
to vibration action gets much higher. At the point of
the resonance, the performed analysis is no longer valid,
because even weak dissipation becomes important and
cannot be neglected.

ρ(aωl)2, are assumed to be much smaller than the
averaged pressure Pg inside a bubble. This assumption
ensures that the averaged radius of the bubbles keeps
constant and equals R. The absolute value of the aver-
aged pressure becomes insigniﬁcant, only its gradient is
of importance.

(54)

The right-hand side of Eq. (54) vanishes, because the

by a quarter-period. For the same reason, there is no
any nontrivial contribution to the averaged mass balance

equation, which transforms to the incompressibility con-
dition for the ﬂuid

div u = 0.

(55)

Equations (52)-(55) together with Eqs. (44), (45) deﬁn-
ing the pulsation potential ψ, represent a set of equations
for the averaged dynamics of a bubbly ﬂuid.

In perfect analogy with the case of nondeformable par-
ticles, the averaged motion induced in a boundary layer
is negligibly small; the principal eﬀect is caused by the
considered mechanism of bulk generation. Thus, at rigid
boundaries the conventional no-slip boundary condition
for the averaged ﬂuid velocity should be imposed. Ac-
cording to (52), the velocity of the bubbles at the bound-
aries does not turn to zero. Thus, the boundary condi-
tions for the concentration of bubbles must be prescribed
at the inﬂow boundaries, i.e., where n
ud > 0 (n is the
outward normal to a boundary).

·

Note that the intensity of the averaged ﬂow of the bub-
bly ﬂuid is signiﬁcantly (by a factor of l2 or c−1) higher
than for the medium with nondeformable particles (see
Sec. II). Contrastingly to the case of nondeformable par-
ticles, the latter circumstance enables us to consider the
vibration parameter ˜Rv to be ﬁnite for bubbly ﬂuids.
However, for low vibration frequencies, Ω
1, this for-
malism is no longer valid. To obtain any nontrivial ef-
fects, it becomes necessary to consider the vibration pa-
rameter ˜Rv as asymptotically large, when the vibration
mechanisms studied in Sec. II become important and can-
not be neglected any more. This situation is of special
consideration and is studied in the next section.

D. Low frequency approximation. Transition to a
suspension of nondeformable particles

≫

The case of the low (with respect to the frequency of
natural oscillation of a bubble) vibration frequency, when
Ω
1, should be treated separately. In this particular
situation, it is convenient to choose the value aωl/Ω2 as
a unit for the velocity of the radial motion, the units for
the other quantities are kept the same. As a result, the
pulsation equations read

can be neglected only provided that the dimensionless
frequency of the radial oscillation of a bubble is large
compared to l.

V. EVOLUTION OF A BUBBLY FLUID IN A
LAYER

A. Statement of the problem

A rather good understanding of vibration action on the
dynamics of a bubbly ﬂuid can be obtained from a one-

−

dimensional consideration. Let us apply Eqs. (52)-(55)
to study the vibration dynamics of this medium in an
1 < z < 1, conﬁned by solid walls,
inﬁnite plane layer
the vibration axis is transversal to the boundaries. The
quiescent state with the uniform distribution of bubbles
is chosen as the initial one. Symmetry of the equations,
boundary conditions, and the initial state enables us to
treat the problem in a half of the layer, where the func-
tions Φ and ψ are even and odd, respectively. The ﬂuid
velocity vanishes due to the incompressibility condition
(55) and the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls.
The concentration and the potential of the pulsation ve-
locity are deﬁned by the following boundary value prob-
lem:

where the prime is used to denote a derivative with re-
spect to z.

It is obvious, that the variation of the absolute value of
Q results only in changing of the time scale, and without
loss of generality, we set further Q =
1 (the upper sign
corresponds to Ω > 1, and the lower one – otherwise).
We can also renormalize the initial concentration in such
a way that Φ(z, t = 0) = 1; this leads only to rescaling of
the frequency Ω.

±

We can easily make sure that there exists no any quasi-
steady state, when the ﬂuid and the bubbles are quiescent
on average. Indeed, for the quasi-steady state it imme-
diately follows from Eqs. (65)

(Φ0ψ0ψ

(67)

i.e., Φ0 = const/(ψ0ψ′

stands for indication of the quasi-steady state solution.

On the other hand, Eq. (64) then transforms to

Initial stage of evolution

(71)

First, consider the case Ω > 1, when the vibration
frequency is lower than that of the natural oscillation of
a bubble. We introduce

and note that this expression for the wave number α is
in agreement with the known disperse relation for waves
in a bubbly medium (see, for example, Ref. 40,41).

The solution to Eq. (69) with the impermeability con-

dition at the boundaries is as follows

α2 =

The resonant frequencies correspond to the divergency of
(71) and are deﬁned by the expression

n = 1 +

π2(2n + 1)2 , n = 0, 1, . . . .

(72)

Note, that at these frequencies it is necessary to account
for dissipation in the pulsation equations.

Taking into account the result (71), we obtain the av-
eraged velocity of the bubbles and the correction to the
concentration

We see that the most rapid decrease of the concen-
tration of bubbles occurs in the vicinities of the points
zn = πn/α, n
Z – the bubbles tend to leave the
nodes of the pulsation pressure; and vice versa, the
concentration grows in the antinodes of the pressure.
This phenomenon is referred to as the primary Bjerknes
eﬀect.17,18 However, we stress, that in our case, the bub-
bles are not just advected by the external nonuniform
pulsation ﬁeld (as in the conventional Bjerknes eﬀect).
The presence of the bubbles causes this nonuniformity.

Let us proceed to the opposite range of frequencies,
Ω < 1. In this case, the frequency of external action is
beyond the passband for the bubbly ﬂuid, i.e., the waves
decay deep into the layer:

ψ =

sinh αz

Further, for the perturbation of the concentration we ﬁnd

(74)

We now turn to investigation of the initial stage of
evolution, when an analytical solution can be obtained.
We assume, that Φ = 1 + Φ1(z, t), where

Thus, the bubbles migrate away from the boundaries
of the layer to its center. As it could be expected, at a
frequency larger than the resonant frequency of a bubble,
the bubbles accumulate in the node of the pressure, at
the center of the layer.

C. Finite time evolution. Numerical results

At ﬁnite times the set of equations (52)-(55), describ-
ing one-dimensional dynamics of a bubbly ﬂuid in the
layer, was studied numerically. The equation for transfer
of the bubbles was integrated by means of the method of
characteristics. The equation for the characteristics has
an obvious form

At the characteristics the following relation is fulﬁlled

The ﬁelds of the concentration Φ and potential ψ are
deﬁned in the nodes of the uniformly spaced grid; we
used up to 2000 grid nodes. In the case when ud(1) <
0, there appears a front of the concentration z = zf (t)
such that Φ
= 0 only in the domain with z < zf . For
this particular situation, the grid nodes were interposed
only in the domain occupied by the bubbly ﬂuid, i.e., for
z < zf (t); in the opposite part of the layer, the equations
admit an obvious solution: Φ = 0, ψ = ψ0 + z. At
the point z = zf the functions ψ, ψ′ are continuous, so
that the value of the constant ψ0 is insigniﬁcant. In the
opposite case, ud(1) > 0, a part of bubbles settles on the

Results of the numerical simulation are presented in

In the case of Ω1 < Ω < Ω0, the bubbles accumulate in
a certain domain inside the layer. The concentration of
the bubbles rises abruptly near the point zs and reaches
inﬁnite values for a ﬁnite time t = t0 – there develops
a peaking regime. The maximal concentration grows as
t0)−1, i.e., a bubble screen develops. The potential
(t
itself remains ﬁnite, while its second derivative tends to
inﬁnity near the point zs. This scenario is demonstrated
for Ω2 = 1.25 in Fig. 5. The averaged concentration of
the bubbles decreases with time. As the eigenfrequency
Ω gets closer to 1, the number of bubble screens increases.
In the case Ω < 1, the bubbles accumulate in the center
of the layer – a node of the pulsation pressure. Evolu-
tion of the maximal concentration, the coordinate zs of a
front, i.e., the interface bubbly ﬂuid–pure ﬂuid, and the
proﬁles of the concentration are depicted in Fig. 6. As
was mentioned above, the bubbles located near the front
(74)], consequently
possess the maximal velocities [cf.
the concentration grows very fast at the front and does
not practically vary in the stagnant core in the center of
the layer.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The averaged dynamics of various two-phase systems
in a high-frequency vibration ﬁeld has been theoretically
studied. The continuum approach was applied to de-
scribe such systems as solid particle suspensions, emul-
sions, bubbly ﬂuids, when the volume concentration of
the disperse phase is small and gravity is insigniﬁcant.
The dynamics of a monodisperse system was considered
by means of the averaging method, when the fast pulsa-
tion and slow averaged motion can be treated separately.
The vibration dynamics of suspensions of both nonde-
formable and deformable particles, when the compress-
ibility of the disperse phase becomes important, has been
investigated.

An averaged model for nondeformable particles has
been obtained. It is shown, that accounting for the Stokes
drag and unsteady forces such as the Basset history term,
the second memory force and the added mass force in the
pulsation motion, is of crucial importance for correct de-
scription of the averaged dynamics. The averaged equa-
tions have been obtained and simpliﬁed in the framework
of the single-ﬂuid approximation. It is proved that the
particles can be treated as frozen into the averaged ﬂuid
ﬂow. As a result the averaged dynamics of a suspension
is described by the equations of momentum and mass
conservation for the carrier ﬂuid and a transfer equation
for the concentration of particles. The action of vibra-
tion results in the appearance of a vibration force in the
equation of the ﬂuid motion. This force is nonvanishing

13

only for the nonuniform distribution of particles, its di-
rection coincides with the vibration axis. We note, that
the developed model is expected to be worth applying to
clarify recent experiments on blood ﬂow resistance under
vibration action.42

The developed model has been applied to study the
behavior of a two-phase medium in an inﬁnite plane
layer subjected to transversal vibrations.
It is demon-
strated that there is a set of possible nonuniform quasi-
equilibrium distributions of particles, when the averaged
ﬂow vanishes but the pulsation velocities do not. The
stability of a linear distribution of particles has been in-
vestigated. Analytical and numerical analysis manifests
that the quasi-equilibrium state is unstable for any in-
tensities of vibration. A nonuniformity of particle dis-
tributions causes the vibration force that generates the
averaged motion in ﬂuid. Because of this ﬂow, the ini-
tial distribution of particles is deformed and the state
becomes unstable.

As a system with deformable particles, the case of bub-
bly ﬂuids in vibration ﬁeld has been analyzed separately.
An averaged model accounting for the compressibility of
the bubbles has been developed. The pulsations were as-
sumed to be inviscid, and a set of averaged equations has
been obtained in the single-ﬂuid approximation. The av-
eraged velocity of bubbles diﬀers from the ﬂuid velocity,
this diﬀerence is caused by vibration and proportional to
its intensity. It is shown that in contrast to the case of
nondeformable particles, the impact of vibration on the
system with deformable particles is signiﬁcantly stronger.
Even for uniform distribution of particles the vibration
force is nonzero.

In the opposite limit, Ω

An intermediate case of

low vibration frequencies,
when the ratio Ω of eigenfrequency of radial bubble oscil-
lations to the the frequency of vibration is high, has been
considered. A criterion when the compressibility of bub-
L/R,
bles can be neglected has been ﬁgured out: Ω
where L is the length scale of the ﬂow and R is the time-
averaged radius of the bubble. In this case the interme-
diate model reduces to the model of for nondeformable
particles.
L/R, the inter-
mediate model transforms to the discussed model where
compressibility of bubbles becomes of crucial importance.
The dynamics of bubbly ﬂuid in an inﬁnite plane layer
under the action of transversal vibration has been ana-
lyzed. The quiescent state with the uniform distribution
of bubbles is chosen as the initial one. It turns out that
for Ω > 1.489 the bubbles migrate to the boundaries of
the layer; for 1 < Ω < 1.489 the bubble screens appear;
for Ω < 1 bubbles accumulate in the center of the layer.
We have demonstrated that the behavior of bubbly ﬂuid
is analogous to the primary Bjerknes eﬀect:
for Ω > 1
the bubbles leave the nodes and accumulate in the antin-
odes of the pressure wave, while for Ω < 1 the bubbles
migrate to the nodes. However, in our case, the bubbles
are not only advected by the external nonuniform ﬁeld,
as in the conventional Bjerknes eﬀect, but also cause this
nonuniformity.

To demonstrate the dependence in more general situ-
ations, we tabulate (21) as a function of K for diﬀerent
values of δ and κ. Typical results are presented in Fig. 7.
As it can be shown, the function B(K) is positive for
all K; it is either monotonic or has a maximum. In the
limits of K
1 the results are independent
of κ and agree with the expressions (A.1) and (A.2), re-
spectively. As it can be expected, the eﬀect of diﬀerent
values of κ occurs at intermediate values of K.

Here we analyze relation (21) as a function of the pa-

the limiting vibration regimes of viscous (K

inviscid (K
pendence in the whole range of values of K and outline
features for some typical media.

(A.1)

Note, in this limit, it is not enough to take into account
only the Stokes force, which would result in vanishing
B and therefore in no vibration force. Physically, this
means that the particles get “frozen” not only in the av-
eraged ﬂow, but in the pulsation ﬂuid ﬂow as well, and
therefore no averaged eﬀects are possible. To account for
any nontrivial dynamics one has to retain small (with re-
spect to the Stokes drag) terms due to memory forces,
which ensures relative pulsation motion of phases. An-
other interesting point is that this result does not depend
on κ.

In the opposite limit of inviscid pulsation, K

1, the
leading contribution to B is made by the added mass
force. The result is sensitive solely to the relative density

Figure 7(a) represents the case of bubbly ﬂuids (δ

The curves go out from the point B = 0 at K = 0, start
to grow at small K as K 3/(9√2) [see relation (A.1)], and
monotonically approach the value B∞ = 1, as follows
from (A.2). For δ

curve in Fig. 7(b) is plotted for a suspension “sand in

ative densities δ the dependence B(K) does not change
qualitatively. In the limiting case of heavy particles sus-
pended in a gaseous medium (solid particle suspension in

air, aerosol), δ
shifts to lower values of K; the asymptotic behavior reads

We report on parametric ampliﬁcation of the dynamic radiation force produced by a bichromatic
acoustic beam in a ﬂuid as the diﬀerence frequency is increased. We develop a theory for dynamic
radiation force taking into account the nonlinearity the ﬂuid. An experiment was designed to
measure this force on an acrylic sphere of 3.2 mm diameter immersed in a ﬂuid. Results yielded
a force of up to 4 N in water and 22 N in alcohol. They are in good agreement with the proposed
theory, and cannot be explained by previous theories.

Acoustic radiation force of compressional waves is a
phenomenon that has been investigated for over a cen-
tury [1]. This force results from variations in energy and
momentum of the wave as it is scattered, attenuated,
or distorted by nonlinear eﬀects. It is similar to optical
radiation pressure exerted by electromagnetic waves on
responsive particles [2]. This force can be either static or
dynamic with respect to its time dependency. The static
force is time-averaged and produced by monochromatic
waves [3]. Here, we consider dynamic radiation force as
an oscillatory steady-state force generated by a bichro-
matic acoustic beam [4].

The prime application of dynamic radiation force was,
to the authors’ knowledge, devised in 1928 by Sivian [5]
to measure acoustic power on a suspended disk. In 1953,
Macnamara et al. [6] developed a method based on this
force to measure absorption in liquids. After these pi-
oneer applications, dynamic radiation force has passed
unnoticed until late 1970’s. In recent years its use has
increased. It has been applied, for instance, to measure
ultrasound power of transducers [7], induce oscillation in
bubbles [8] and liquid drops [9], and excite modes in cap-
illary bridges [10]. Furthermore, dynamic radiation force
is the underlying principle of some elastography imaging
techniques such as shear wave elasticity imaging [11] and
vibro-acoustography [4]. For material evaluation, it has
been used in measuring viscoelasticity [12] and determin-
ing porosity [13].

Despite early applications, dynamic radiation force has
only recently been investigated in theoretical grounds.
Mitri et al. [14] have calculated the radiation force due
to a bichromatic plane wave on an elastic cylinder. He
also studied the force produced by a bichromatic standing
plane wave [15]. Silva et al. [16] obtained the radiation
force of a bichromatic plane wave on an elastic sphere.
This study was conﬁrmed in an experiment realized by
Chen et al. [17]. So far, these theories have not taken into
account the inﬂuence of the ﬂuid nonlinearity thoroughly.
By nonlinearity of the ﬂuid we mean the parameter asso-
ciated to the thermodynamic nonlinear relation between

pressure and density. The validity of these previous re-
sults is limited to the case where the diﬀerence between
the fundamental wave frequencies is very narrow. Eﬀects
of ﬂuid nonlinearity in static radiation force produced by
a low-amplitude acoustic beam in lossless ﬂuids is not
relevant at all [18]. Up to this point, a question arises:
how does dynamic radiation force depend on ﬂuid non-
linearity?

In this letter we undertake this issue. Our analysis
unfolds that dynamic radiation force is chieﬂy caused by
acoustic parametric ampliﬁcation [19]. This phenomenon
has a counterpart with parametric ampliﬁcation of elec-
tromagnetic waves propagating in nonlinear dielectric
media [20]. We calculate the dynamic radiation force
exerted on a rigid sphere by solving the corresponding
scattering problem in the quasilinear approximation. An
experimental setup using a laser vibrometer is designed
to measure the dynamic radiation force pushing out an
acrylic sphere immersed in a ﬂuid (ethyl alcohol or de-
gassed water). Experimental data are in good agreement
with the theory presented here. They conﬁrm an am-
pliﬁcation of dynamic radiation force of up to 30 dB in
water and 40 dB in alcohol. This cannot be explained by
previous theoretical works.

Consider a homogeneous isotropic ﬂuid with adiabatic
speed of sound c0, in which thermal conductivity and vis-
cosity are neglected. The ﬂuid is considered to be irrota-
tional with inﬁnite extent and characterized by the fol-
lowing acoustic ﬁelds: pressure p, density ρ, and particle
velocity v = −∇φ. The function φ is the velocity poten-
tial and ∇ is the gradient operator. These ﬁelds are func-
tion of the position vector r and the time t. At rest, these
quantities assume constant values p = p0, ρ = ρ0, and
v = 0. The acoustic ﬁelds are governed by the dynamic
equations of lossless ﬂuids. They are nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations. By using the regular perturbation
technique, one can expand velocity particle in terms of
the Mach number ε ≪ 1 as φ = εφ(1) + ε2φ(2) + O(ε3).
An analysis of the radiation force problem has to be done
in at least the second-order.

The excess pressure in the ﬂuid can be written as p −

p0 = p(1) + p(2) + O(ε3), where [21]

are the linear and the second-order pressure ﬁelds, re-
spectively. The ﬁrst two terms in the right-hand side of
Eq. (2) depend only on φ(1). They correspond to the
Lagrangian density of the wave. As we shall see the po-
tential φ(1) does not depend on the ﬂuid nonlinearity,
while φ(2) does. Thus, Eq. (2) can be separated as a sum
of two pressures that we call here as the Lagrangian and
the nonlinear pressures.

Let S0 be the surface of the object target at rest. One
can show that the instantaneous force on the object up
to second-order in pressure is given by [22]

where S(t) is the moving object surface, n is the out-
ward normal unit-vector on the integration surface. As-
suming that the sphere is under inﬂuence of a bichro-
matic acoustic beam with fundamental angular frequen-
cies ω1 and ω2, the dynamic radiation force is produced
by the contribution of stresses at the diﬀerence frequency
ω21 = ω2 − ω1.

It is useful to consider the Fourier transform of a func-
tion g(t) denoted by F [g]. The dynamic radiation force
on the object is given by the Fourier component of Eq. (3)
at ω21, i.e., f21 = ˆf21e−iω21t, where i is the imaginary
unit. The complex amplitude of the dynamic radiation
force is given by [16]

is the nonlinear Fox-Wallace parameter [24].

The bichromatic plane-wave beam is formed by the
harmonic excitation v = εc0(sin ω1t+sin ω2t)ez at z = 0,
where ez is the unit vector in the z direction. For the
perturbation terms of the velocity potential, one has the
boundary conditions ∂φ(1)/∂z = −c0(sin ω1t + sin ω2t)
and ∂φ(2)/∂z = 0 at z = 0. The solution of Eq. (6) is

where k21 = ω21/c0. We emphasize that to obtain the
radiation force exerted on any target, one has to solve
the associate scattering problem for both potentials φ(1)
and φ(2)
21 .

In what follows we calculate the dynamic radiation
force on a rigid sphere of radius a and density ρ1. The
radiation force given in Eq. (4) has contributions from
the Lagrangian, the linear and the nonlinear pressures,
and the Reynolds’ stress tensor. We shall concentrate on
the contribution of the nonlinear pressure.

The linear pressure pushes out the sphere which un-
dergoes into oscillations with frequencies ω1 and ω2 along
the z axis. One can show the contribution of the linear
pressure to the dynamic radiation force is proportional
to (ωmZm)−1, where Zm is the total impedance of the
oscillating rigid sphere at each fundamental frequency.
This impedance is given by [17]

where xm = kma is sphere size factor. Observe that
(ωmZm)−1 = 0. We use frequencies above 2.2 MHz
lim
ωm→∞
in the experiments to measure the dynamic radiation
force on an acrylic sphere of 3.2 mm diameter.
In this
case, the magnitude of (ωmZm)−1 is as small as 10−6.
Thus, this contribution can be neglected.

The sphere is placed at a distance z0 from the acous-
tic source. We assume that k21z0 ≫ 1 and a ≪ z0.
Let E0 = ε2ρ0c2
0/2 be the energy density at the acous-
tic source. The nonlinear pressure component at ω21
is p21 = ε2ρ0∂φ(2)
21 /∂t. From Eq. (9), the amplitude of
the nonlinear pressure in spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ),
is given in terms of partial spherical waves as

where A = −iE0γk21z0eik21z0 , the functions jn and hn
are the nth-order spherical Bessel and ﬁrst-type Hankel
functions, respectively. The functions Pn are the Legen-
dre polynomials.

The scattering coeﬃcients bn are given by [25] bn =

sult of Ref. [16], substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (4), and
neglecting the direct contribution of the linear pressure,
one obtains the dynamic radiation force as

The symbol ∗ is complex conjugate. The last term in
the right-hand side of Eq. (13) represents the parametric
ampliﬁcation of the radiation force with respect to the
nonlinear parameter γ and the frequency diﬀerence ω21.
Such ampliﬁcation can be neglected only when ω1 ≃ ω2.
In any other situation, the parametric ampliﬁcation over-
comes the contribution of the term in the brackets of
Eq. (13). So far, this ampliﬁcation has not been taken
into account in the theory of dynamic radiation force (see
Refs. [14, 15, 16]).

In Fig. (1), we plotted the magnitude of ˆY21 as a
function of the size factors x1 and x2 with the ratio
z0/a = 125. The ﬂuid under consideration is water and
the sphere has density of ρ1 = 1400 kg/m3 (acrylic). For
x21 = 0 we have the static radiation force on the sphere.
Notice that the ampliﬁcation saturates as we move far
from the line x2 = x1.

We measure the dynamic radiation force exerted on
an acrylic sphere of diameter 3.2 mm. Acrylic is a
lightweight material and consequently has low impedance
to oscillate in ﬂuids. The sphere was suspended by a bi-
ﬁlar human hair in degassed water or ethyl alcohol form-
ing a pendulum [17]. An in-house ﬂat transducer with
22 mm diameter was used to insonify the sphere. The
sphere was placed in the beam axis 20 cm away from
the transducer. We used a suppressed-carrier amplitude-
modulated signal to drive the transducer. The carrier
frequency was 2.25 MHz and the modulation frequency
was swept from 0.8 to 220 kHz. The transducer band-
width is large enough to keep the ultrasound intensity

tion on the acrylic sphere in water as a function of the size

constant for practical purposes as the modulation fre-
quency is tuned within the speciﬁed range.

The vibration of the sphere was detected by a laser vi-
brometer (Polytec GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany), which
is aligned with the beam axis of the transducer. The laser
measures the velocity magnitude of the sphere vibration
at the frequency diﬀerence ω21. The force on the sphere
is equal to this velocity times the total impedance of the
sphere given in Eq. (10). The sphere has a = 1.6 mm
and ρ1 = 1400 kg/m3. The parameters for water are
ρ0 = 1000 kg/m3, c0 = 1500 m/s, and γ = 6; while for
alcohol ρ0 = 785 kg/m3, c0 = 1100 m/s, and γ = 11.

The experimental data are exhibited in Fig. 2. The

veloped here. Theoretical predictions without paramet-

ric ampliﬁcation (Lagrangian pressure) are shown by the
dash-dotted and the dotted lines. Observe that the
Lagrangian pressure does not present signiﬁcant vari-
ation with the diﬀerence frequency. Because the en-
ergy density is not known from the experiment, we ad-
justed these curves using E0 = 4.32 J/m3 for alcohol and
E0 = 1.83 J/m3 for water. The measured magnitude of
the radiation force on the sphere at 220 kHz is 4 N for
water and 22 N for alcohol. The theory and experimen-
tal data are in good agreement. The experimental results
are lower in magnitude than the theoretical predictions.
Diﬀraction of the incident beam that reduce the energy
upon the target was not taken into account. Moreover,
elasticity of the acrylic sphere changes the scattering co-
eﬃcients bn. This may explain the discrepancy between
the theory and experimental results.

In summary, this paper presented a comprehensive the-
ory for dynamic radiation force of acoustic waves taking
into account ﬂuid nonlinearity. An experiment was de-
signed to validate this theory. The force ampliﬁcation
reaches 30 dB in water 40 dB in alcohol. The scattering
problem involved in the calculation of dynamic radia-
tion force must be solved through the boundary-value
problem deﬁned by Eqs. (6) and (7). For practical appli-
cations, these equations might be solved numerically. In
conclusion, we believe the parametric ampliﬁcation of ra-
diation force may open up new applications in elasticity
and nonlinear imaging of biological tissue, and trapping

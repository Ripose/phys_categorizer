Abstract

We apply lattice Boltzmann methods to study the relaxation of the velocity
proﬁle in binary ﬂuids under shear during spinodal decomposition. In simple
ﬂuids, when a shear ﬂow is applied on the boundaries of the system, the time
required to obtain a triangular proﬁle is inversely proportional to the viscosity
and proportional to the square of the size of the system. We ﬁnd that the
same behaviour also occurs for binary mixtures, for any component ratio in
the mixture and independently from the time when shear ﬂow is switched on
during phase separation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, the dynamical behaviour of complex ﬂuid and binary mixtures under the action
of applied ﬂows has been investigated in many theoretical and experimental works [1]. In
phase separating binary mixtures the morphology and the growth properties of the domains
of the two components are greatly aﬀected by the presence of a ﬂow [2]. This ﬂow is generally
imposed from the boundaries onto the system and takes some time to reach its steady value.
If this time is comparable with other typical time-scales in the system, transient eﬀects have
to be carefully considered. For example, in the case of an oscillating shear ﬂow, the ratio
between the period of the applied ﬂow and the relaxation time of a triangular steady shear
proﬁle is relevant for the eﬀectiveness of the ﬂow on the bulk of the system. In spinodal
decomposition, if that ratio is small, the growth remains mainly isotropic and elongated
domains can be observed only in the boundary layers [3].

The estimation of relaxation times of applied ﬂows is generally based on analogies with
simple ﬂuids. However, a careful checking of the laws valid for simple ﬂuids in cases when
mesoscopic structures are present in the system - e.g. interfaces between domains in spinodal
decomposition, cannot be found in literature. In this paper we evaluate numerically the re-
laxational properties of a triangular shear ﬂow applied on phase separating binary mixtures.
At a certain time during phase separation the top and the bottom boundaries of our system
start to move with velocities w and
w respectively and after a while a triangular proﬁle
will appear. We study the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld in terms of the viscosity and of the
size of the system and ﬁnd that the results for a simple ﬂuid also hold in the case of binary
mixtures with interfaces inside.

We simulate the binary mixture system by applying lattice Boltzmann methods which
allow to mimic the behaviour of a system described by Navier-Stokes and convection-diﬀusion
equations. The lattice Boltzmann algorithm is based on a collision step and a propagation
step occurring on time ∆t. Only a ﬁnite sets of local velocities are allowed. In particular we
use a scheme based on a free-energy approach which has the advantage that the equilibrium
thermodynamics of the system is “a priori” known. The role of the simulation time step ∆t
will be also considered. With fast relaxing velocity proﬁles, the usual choice ∆t = 1 is not
appropriate for obtaining smoothly relaxing proﬁles and smaller ∆t have to be considered.
In the next section we brieﬂy describe the methods used in the simulations; section III

contains our results and section IV some conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a two-dimensional binary ﬂuid with components A and B of number den-
sity ρA and ρB, respectively. Such a system can be modeled by the following free energy
functional,

F =

ρB is the local density diﬀerence and
where ρ = ρA+ρB is the local total density and ϕ = ρA−
the order parameter of the system; the term in ρ gives rise to a positive background pressure

and does not aﬀect the phase behavior. The terms in ϕ correspond to the usual Ginzburg-
Landau free energy typically used in studies of phase separation [4]. The polynomial terms
are related to the bulk properties of the ﬂuid. The gradient term is related to the interfacial
properties. The parameter b is always positive, while the sign of a distinguishes between
a disordered (a > 0) and a segregated mixture (a < 0) where the two pure phases with
ϕ =
a/b coexist. In this paper we will consider quenches into the coexistence region
with a < 0 and b =
1.
The initial state in simulations will be random conﬁgurations corresponding to the high
temperature disordered phase.

The thermodynamic properties of the ﬂuid follow directly from the free energy (1). The

chemical potential diﬀerence between the two ﬂuids is given by

The pressure is a tensor Pαβ since interfaces in the ﬂuids can exert non-isotropic forces [6].

Our simulations are based on the lattice Boltzmann scheme developed by Orlandini et
al [8]. and Swift et al. [9] . In this scheme the equilibrium properties of the system can
be controlled by introducing a free energy which enters properly into the lattice Boltzmann
model. The scheme used in this paper is based on the D2Q9 lattice: A square lattice is used
in which each site is connected with nearest and next-nearest neighbors. The horizontal and
vertical links have length ∆x, the diagonal links √2∆x, where ∆x is the space step. Two sets
of distribution functions fi(r, t) and gi(r, t) are deﬁned on each lattice site r at each time t.
Each of them is associated with a velocity vector ei. Deﬁned ∆t as the simulation time step,
the quantities ei∆t are constrained to be lattice vectors so that
c for i = 1,
= √2c for i = 5, 6, 7, 8. Two functions f0(r, t) and g0(r, t), corresponding
2, 3, 4 and
to the distribution components that do not propagate (e0 = 0), are also taken into account.
The distribution functions evolve during the time step ∆t according to a single relaxation
time Boltzmann equation [10,11]:

where Pαβ is the pressure tensor, ∆µ is the chemical potential diﬀerence between the two
ﬂuids and Γ is a coeﬃcient related to the mobility of the ﬂuid. We stress that we are con-
sidering a mixture with two ﬂuids having the same mechanical properties and, in particular,
the same viscosity. The second constraint in Eq. (9) expresses the fact that the two ﬂuids
have the same velocity.

A suitable choice of the coeﬃcients in the expansions (7) is shown in Ref. [3]. Such
a lattice Boltzmann scheme simulates at second order in ∆t the continuity, the quasi-
incompressible Navier-Stokes and the convection-diﬀusion equations with the kinematic vis-
cosity ν and the macroscopic mobility Θ given by [12–14]

The shear ﬂow can be imposed by introducing boundary walls on the top and bottom
rows of lattice sites. The velocities of the upper and lower walls are along the horizontal
direction and their values are w and
1)/2 and γ is
the shear rate imposed on the system. The bounce-back rule [15,16] is adopted for the
distribution functions normal to the boundary walls. In order to preserve correctly mass
conservation, a further constraint, related to the distribution functions at the previous time
step (t

∆t), is used. Details of the scheme are given in Ref. [17].

III. RESULTS

We numerically check the relaxation behaviors of the horizontal velocity proﬁle for sym-
metric and asymmetric binary ﬂuids. We consider two cases: (i) switch on the shear from
the beginning of the phase separation and (ii) switch on the shear during the phase sepa-
rating process and after the interfaces between the two ﬂuids have formed. We denote the
time at which the shear is switched on as ton. We focus on the eﬀects of viscosity, so we
vary τ in the simulations. The other parameters, if not diﬀerently stated, are ﬁxed at the

Figure 1 shows the relaxation of the horizontal velocity proﬁle for a symmetric binary
ﬂuid with τ = 2, L = 64, ton = 5000. The four lines correspond to t = 5020, t = 5040,
t = 5060, t = 5120. From this ﬁgure we can see how the shear ﬂow comes into the bulk of the
system. When t > 5120 the velocity proﬁle shows an almost linear behavior with y. Before
switching on the shear the domains grow isotropically. After ton anisotropic behavior come
into the bulk of the system with time. Figure 2 shows the conﬁguration at the time t = 5120.
Domains separated by well formed interfaces can be observed to incline to the ﬂow direction
with time. For the case ton = 0 we observed the same behavior for the velocity proﬁle, while
the interfaces have not reached their equilibrium shape. That means the existence of the
interfaces does not inﬂuence the shear eﬀects coming into the system. For the asymmetric
case, we studied the binary ﬂuid with the ratio 80 : 20. After switching on the shear the
velocity proﬁle shows the same behavior.

To understand better the time evolution of the velocity proﬁle of binary mixtures, we
take the simple ﬂuid as a reference. We consider the Newtonian viscous ﬂow between two
inﬁnite plates with a distance of L. We use y to denote the coordinate in the vertical
direction and y = 0 in the middle of the system. The velocities of the upper and the lower
plates are w and
w, respectively . The shear rate imposed on the system is γ. The motion

When t is large enough, the modes with n

simulations. So we can deﬁne a relaxation time for the velocity proﬁle in the following way,

It is interesting to see if or not such a deﬁnition also works for binary ﬂuids. To numerically
check the relation between TR and ν (or τ ) or L, we calculate TR in the following way,

In order to calculate TR, we use a time t at which the velocity proﬁle has been almost linear,
so that terms with n

2 in Eq.(13) can be neglected.

Figure 3 shows the simulation results for TR as a function of ν, where L = 128, ∆t = 0.2,
the vertical axis is for 1/TR and the horizontal axis is for ν so that we expect a linear
behavior. The dotted line with points correspond to the simulation results and the solid line
corresponds to the expected value from the deﬁnition (14). The simulation results conﬁrm
the existence of the exponential behavior in the relaxation process of the velocity proﬁle and
the validity of the deﬁnition of TR.

Figure 4 shows TR as a function of L, where the vertical axis is for TR and the horizontal
axis is for L2 . The dotted lines with symbols are simulation results for the cases of ν = 4.17,
ν = 5.83 and ν = 7.5. The solid lines are the expected values from the deﬁnition (14). The
four points in each case correspond to L = 64, 128, 256, and 512. The simulation step in
this ﬁgure is ∆t = 0.2. We ﬁnd the expected linear behavior between TR and L2.

There is a bending tendency in the simulation results for 1/TR in Fig.3, so that the
simulation results deviate from the expected values. If we continue the simulation up to
a much higher viscosity region, we will ﬁnd a more pronounced bending behavior. We
emphasize that this is an artiﬁcial phenomenon, which can be mainly attributed to the
ﬁnite size of the simulation step ∆t. If the viscosity is larger the velocity proﬁle relaxes more
quickly and we should use a smaller time step ∆t for the simulation. When the viscosity
is very high and ∆t is not small enough we can not observe smooth velocity proﬁles in the
simulation. To conﬁrm this numerical analysis we show two simulation results in Fig.5,
where the deﬁnition value of 1/TR is also shown to guide the eyes. Compared with the case
of ∆t = 0.2, when we use ∆t = 0.1 the linear behavior region is almost doubled.

Finally, it is interesting to compare the relaxation behaviors of binary and simple ﬂuids.
Fig.6 shows the simulation results of the velocity proﬁles for the case with L = 256, τ = 2
(ν = 2.5), t
ton = 600. The solid line corresponds to Eq. (13) with n = 1. From this ﬁgure
the following remarks are evident: (i) the relaxation process of the binary mixtures follows
the same behavior as that of simple ﬂuids; (ii)for binary mixtures the relaxation behavior
of the velocity proﬁle is independent of the component ratio and the time when shear is
switched on, which means that the forming of the interfaces does not evidently inﬂuence the
shear eﬀects coming into the system.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we study the relaxation behavior of the velocity proﬁle of binary mixtures
under steady shear with lattice Boltzmann methods. Following the simple Newtonian vis-
cous ﬂow, we deﬁne a relaxation time of the velocity proﬁle TR whose value is inversely
proportional to the viscosity and proportional to the square of the size of the system. The
simulation results show that the shear eﬀects come into the system in the same way for
binary mixtures and simple ﬂuids, which conﬁrm the validity of the deﬁnition of TR in this
and previous studies [3]. For binary mixtures, the shear behavior is independent of the

6

component ratio and the time at which the shear is switched on. The presence of inter-
faces between the two ﬂuids has negligible inﬂuence on the relaxation process of the velocity
proﬁle.

INTRODUCTION

Over the years, our research into turbulence at Edin-
burgh has concentrated on the application of renormaliza-
tion methods to the prediction of the energy spectrum of
isotropic turbulence. General discussions of this work will
be found elsewhere (McComb 1990, 1995), while accounts
of speciﬁc progress have been given previously in this con-
ference series (McComb & Shanmugasundaram 1983, Mc-
Comb, Filipiak, Roberts & Watt, 1991).

From a practical point of view, the most promising de-
velopment in this area is undoubtedly Renormalization
Group or RG. If we work in the Fourier representation,
in principle, this involves the progressive averaging out of
high-wavenumber modes in bands, with rescaling at each
step, until a ﬁxed point is reached. The result is, in eﬀect,
a ‘subgrid model’ for large-eddy simulation.

RG has enjoyed its successes in other areas of statistical
physics. However, its application to turbulence faces sev-
eral technical diﬃculties, which have to be circumvented by
uncontrolled approximations. Indeed, in view of the deter-
ministic nature of the Navier-Stokes equations, it is clear
that the operation of averaging out the high-wavenumber
modes while keeping the low-wavenumber modes constant,
cannot be done rigorously and in itself can only be an ap-
proximation.

With points like this in mind, we have recently adopted
direct numerical simulation as a tool for probing the basic
feasibility of using RG techniques to reduce the number of
degrees of freedom requiring to be numerically simulated.
In this paper, we present some of the ﬁrst results of this
approach. We begin by discussing the RG approach in
detail.

RENORMALIZATION GROUP THEORY

Basic Equations

Working in Fourier-wavevector (k) space and restricting
our attention to turbulent velocity ﬁelds which are homo-
geneous, isotropic and stationary, we may write the pair-
correlation of velocities as

) is the spectral density and the projector
where Q(k, t − t
−2 arises due to the incompressibility
Dαβ(k) = δαβ+kαkβk
condition. Thus, the energy spectrum E(k) = 4πk2Q(k)
with Q(k) = Q(k, 0) and the maximum cut-oﬀ wave-
number, k0, is deﬁned via the dissipation integral

where ε is the dissipation rate, ν0 is the kinematic viscosity,
and k0 is of the same order of magnitude as the Kolmogorov
dissipation wave-number.

Renormalization Group Theory

Taking our goal to be the calculation of the energy spec-
trum E(k), our intermediate objective is to ﬁnd an analyt-
ical method of reducing the number of degrees of freedom
(or Fourier modes), in order to make the numerical solu-
tion of the equations of motion a practical proposition. Let
us consider how this might be done by using RG.

α (k, t) for 0 < k < k1 and uα(k, t) = u+

First, we divide up the velocity ﬁeld at k = k1 as
uα(k, t) = u−
α (k, t)
for k1 < k < k0, where k1 = (1 − η)k0 and the bandwidth
parameter η satisﬁes the condition 0 < η < 1. Work-
ing with the standard form of the solenoidal Navier-Stokes
equation in k-space, we may write the evolution of the low-
k velocity ﬁeld for 0 < k < k1 as

same signiﬁcance as for uα(k, t), and the symmetrized
−1[kβDαγ (k) +
inertial transfer operator Mαβγ (k) = (2i)
kγ Dαβ(k)].

In principle, the RG approach involves two stages: (i)
Eliminate the high-k modes, u+, which appear in equation
(3) for 0 < k < k1, by solving for the mean eﬀect of the
high-k ﬁeld. This results in an increment to the viscosity,
i.e. ν0 → ν1 = ν0 + δν0. (ii) Rescale the basic variables, so
that the Navier-Stokes equation for 0 < k < k1 looks like
the original Navier-Stokes equation for 0 < k < k0.

Although this procedure is appealingly simple and has
a clear physical interpretation, it has not proved easy to
put into practice in the turbulence problem. A typical
approach is to eliminate all the high-k eﬀects in equation
(3), by substituting the solution of equation (4), directly
into the u+ modes in the u−
equation. However, prob-
lems are then encountered because of the mode coupling
between u−
and u+. Even if one succeeds in carrying out
the ﬁrst part, the further problem of averaging out the
high-k modes arises immediately, because u−
and u+ are
not statistically independent. This problem was avoided
by Foster, Nelson and Stephen (1977; hereafter referred to
as FNS) in their pioneering study of stirred ﬂuid motion, as
they restricted their attention to stirring forces which were
multivariate normal and excluded the eﬀects of the turbu-
lence cascade. However, it has been shown that the use of
a ‘ﬁltered’ average by FNS to eliminate the u−
equation is
really an uncontrolled approximation (Eyink, 1994).

Iterative-Averaging RG with Results

Here, we follow the method of iterative averaging, which
is based upon the derivation of a recurrence relation and,
in principle, eliminating ﬁnite blocks of modes (i.e. high-k
modes) while maintaining the form invariance of the dy-
namical equation. Apart from the work of FNS, elimina-
tion procedures can be performed by ‘conditional’ averag-
ing, ﬁrst introduced by McComb (1982). Further details
about the conditional average have been given elsewhere
(McComb, Robert and Watt, 1992). The basic ansatz of a
conditional average is that a small uncertainty (Φ
, say)
at the cutoﬀ wavenumber will generate chaotic behaviour
−
for the high-k modes. Although the introduction of Φ
has been accepted, mainly due to the chaotic nature of the
Navier-Stokes equations, it might be interesting to see how
‘rapidly’ chaotic behaviour develops from the given small

−

Φ− by numerical simulation. This aspect is one of our cur-
rent tasks and the results will be reported in due course.

The current result of the iterative-averaging calculation
for the Navier-Stokes equations after ﬁrst eliminating the
high-k eﬀects is

Here, we consider space dimension d = 3. This result can
be extended to further shells, and we have shown elsewhere
(McComb and Watt, 1992) that a ﬁxed point is reached
under numerical iteration of the recursion relations (see
also Figure 1). In Figure 2, we show a calculation of the
Kolmogorov constant α = 1.60 ± 0.01 independent of the
bandwidth of modes being eliminated for bandwidths in
the range 0.25 ≤ η ≤ 0.45, in agreement with experiment.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

Two programmes of numerical simulation are being car-
ried out — one at the University of Edinburgh in the
United Kingdom, the other at the Swiss Federal Insti-
tute of Technology, Lausanne. A large number of runs
have already been carried out at Lausanne, and this paper
presents some of the results obtained so far.

The simulations themselves are very similar, while the
computer systems on which they are run diﬀer greatly. At
Edinburgh, work is carried out on a parallel machine, the
Cray T3D, while in Lausanne a parallel-vector machine,
the NEC SX-4, is used.

The simulations discussed in this paper were carried out
at a resolution of 2563, requiring approximately 14 seconds
of SX-4 time per time-step on a single processor.

The general method of such simulations has been well
established. We follow the work of Orszag for the con-
struction of initial velocity ﬁelds (1969) and in the use
of a pseudospectral method (1971). The time integration
scheme is a second-order Runge-Kutta method and partial
dealiasing is achieved by way of a random-shifting method
(see, for example, Rogallo, 1981).

Statistics

While our simulations are entirely conventional, we do
not rely solely on the usual practice (as justiﬁed by
isotropy) of averaging over shells in wavenumber space
in order to obtain statistical quantities, but also generate
many realizations in order to increase our sample size.

The main characteristics of the simulation are reported
in Table 1, where ∆t is the time step, T is the integration
time, νo is the molecular viscosity, kf is deﬁned in (8), k0
is the ultraviolet cut-oﬀ, ε is the mean dissipation rate, Rλ
is the Reynolds number based on the Taylor microscale, L
is the integral scale, λ is the Taylor microscale, τE is the
turnover time and s3 and s4 are respectively the skewness
and ﬂatness of the velocity derivative.

The equations have been integrated for more than 60
turnover times and about 200 box-realizations of each com-
ponent of the velocity ﬁeld have been stored in a database.
Since these box-realizations are separated by ≈ τE/4 they
can be considered statistically independent for the middle-
range-scales and the small-scales.

RESULTS

We wish to assess the freedom to carry out conditional
averages of the type required by RG. In principle we may
do this by extracting, from an ensemble of realizations of
the velocity ﬁeld

X = {X (n)

α (k, t) | α = 1, 2, 3; t ∈ [0, T ];
0 ≤ |k| ≤ k0; n = 1, ..., N },

(10)

two disjoint subensembles Y and Z chosen such that, for a
prescribed ζ > 0,

|Y (m)(k, t) − Z (m)(k, t)|2
2h|Y (m)(k, t)|2i

≤ ζ

for all 0 ≤ |k| ≤ kc ; m = 1, ..., M ; t ∈ [0, T ],

(11)

ζ = 0.5 and α = 1. (b) A selected set of realizations showing

for each realization Y (m) ∈ Y and Z (m) ∈ Z. We may
then deﬁne the relative energy of the error

r(|k|) =

h(u(k, t) − w(k, t))2i
2hu(k, t)2i

,

(12)

where u(k, t) ∈ Y and w(k, t) ∈ Z. (It is important to note
that the averages in the deﬁnition (12) are, in this context,
subensemble averages deﬁned on Y and Z and not ensem-
ble averages on X .)
In equation (12) and subsequently,
we assume that the ﬁelds are statistically stationary and
isotropic, therefore r depends only on |k|. Since the two
ﬁelds are very close when 0 ≤ |k| ≤ kc, r(|k|) will be much
smaller than 1 in this interval, indicating that the ﬁelds
are almost completely correlated. If the error between the
ﬁelds grows in such a way that they become decorrelated,
we will have r(|k|) → 1 as |k| ≥ kc increases.

In practice, our 200 box-realizations are not suﬃcient
for the above analysis and we shall describe how we have
extracted, using a partial sampling technique, enough real-
izations to compute the relative energy of the error deﬁned
by (12).

In order to this, we have performed the following partial

Fourier transform of one component of the velocity ﬁeld

uα(x, y, k) =

uα(x, y, z)eikz dk,

(13)

1
2π Z

then we have selected, for each box-realization, a set of
realizations, say uα(xi, yi, k), where the spacing δx =
|xi+1 − xi| = |yi+1 − yi| is chosen such that the realiza-
tions are (approximately) independent for the range of k
we consider (if we consider only the scales such that k ≥ kb,
then δx = 2π/kb). The union of all these realizations ob-
tained for each of the box-realizations will constitute our
ensemble X . The subensemble Y is formed by choosing an
arbitrary subensemble of X . To select the subensemble Z,
we impose the condition

|Y (m)(k) − Z(m)(k)|2
2h|Y (m)(k, t)|2i
for all kb ≤ k ≤ kc ; m = 1, ..., M.

≤ ζ

(14)

Note that the time dependence does not appear in the
equations since all the box-realizations used to form the
ensemble X are taken in the statistically steady regime.
Figure 3(a) shows the relative energy error

r(k) =

h(u(k) − w(k))2i
2hu(k)2i

,

(15)

where u ∈ Y and w ∈ Z for kb = 10, kc = 15, ζ = 0.5
and α = 1. The number of realizations M is 2533. Though
the number of realizations is not large enough to have a
smooth converged solution, one can see that the relaxation
to a chaotic regime is indeed very fast. Figure 3(b) shows
a selected set of realizations for which one can observe that
the constraint imposed for 10 ≤ k ≤ 15 does not prevent
strong ﬂuctuations for k ≥ 15. The convergence of r(k) is
diﬃcult to improve, due to the restriction on the number
of realizations available for a given constraint.

Another natural way in which the small-scale proper-
ties of a conditional subensemble may be investigated is
by studying the probability density functions (pdfs) of ve-
locity increments.
In physical-space, we can use homo-
geneity in the three dimensions and have suﬃciently large
subensembles to compute high-order statistics and pdfs.
The velocity increments are deﬁned by the following rela-
tion

δu(x, h) = u(x + h) − u(x),

(16)
where h is a displacement vector and x the position. Since
the ﬁelds are statistically isotropic, we can restrict our-
selves to the study of the longitudinal velocity increment
δvL(h) which is the projection of δu(h) on the direction
of the vector h and the lateral velocity increment δvT (h)
which is the projection of δu(h) on a direction perpendic-
ular to h. For the purpose of this paper, we have only
studied the longitudinal velocity increment δvL(h). We
have selected two scales, h1 = λ/1.26 and h2 = λ/5.01 (λ
is the Taylor micro-scale, therefore h1 is a typical scale in
the inertial subrange and h2 is in the dissipation subrange).
The selection of the subensembles is performed using con-
ditions of the type a < δvL(h1) < b. The pdfs of δvL(h2)
for the unconditional ensemble and for the subensembles
are then compared. Figure 4 gives the normalized pdf (σ
is the standard deviation of δvL(h)) of the unconditional
ensemble for h = h1 and h = h2. We observe the clas-
sical result that the tails of the pdfs are growing as the
scale is decreased which is the signature of growing inter-
mittency. The pdf also shows a negative skewness which
is a direct consequence of the nonlinear dynamics of the
Navier-Stokes equations. Figure 5, shows the pdfs of the
unconditional ensemble and of a subensemble deﬁned by
the constraint −1 < δvL(h1) < 0. The pdfs are almost
superimposed, showing that the ﬂow at scale h2 is unaf-
fected by the condition imposed at scale h1. Figure 6 is
a case for which the subensemble is much smaller due to
a more restrictive condition, 1 < δvL(h1) < 4. However,
the general behavior of the pdf supports the view that the
chaotic dynamics of the Navier-Stokes equations tends to
restore the original distribution. Note that the skewness is
incorrectly predicted and seems to be correlated with the
sign of δvL(h1). Figure 7 presents a case with a very strong
condition, −7 < δvL(h1) < −2. Though the number of re-
alizations is small, we observe that the top of the pdf is
quite accurately reproduced.

CONCLUSION

These results, although preliminary in nature, oﬀer cru-
cial support to the hypothesis that a conditional average
may be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom
required for the numerical simulation of turbulence. Work
is continuing to make a more stringent assessment of the
validity of such averages for turbulence and this includes

The non-linear bubble dynamics equations in a compressible liquid have been modiﬁed considering
the eﬀects of compressibility of both the liquid and the gas at the bubble interface. A new bubble
boundary equation has been derived, which includes a new term resulted from the liquid bulk
viscosity eﬀects. The inﬂuence of this term has been numerically investigated considering the eﬀects
of water vapor and chemical reactions on the bubble evolution. The results clearly indicate that
the new term has an important damping role at the collapse, so that its consideration decreases the
amplitude of the bubble rebounds after the collapse. This damping feature is more remarkable for
higher deriving pressures.

When a small isolated gas bubble, immersed in a liq-
uid, experiences a high amplitude spherical sound ﬁeld,
it grows and contracts non-linearly. Description of the
dynamics of such non-linear motion is an old challeng-
ing problem. The radial dynamics of the bubble in an
incompressible liquid is described by the well-known in-
compressible Rayleigh-Plesset equation [1, 2]. The exten-
sion of this equation to the bubble motion in a compress-
ible liquid has been studied by many previous authors
[3, 4]. The most complete existing description was pre-
sented by Prosperetti and Lezzi [5]. They used a singular-
perturbation method of the bubble-wall Mach number
and derived a one-parameter family of equations describ-
ing the bubble motion in the ﬁrst order approximation of
compressibility. This family of equations are written as:

where, R, C, P0, Pa, and ρ are bubble radius, liquid
sound speed, ambient pressure, driving pressure, and
density of the liquid, respectively. Also, η is an arbi-
trary parameter. Equation (1) must be supplemented by
a boundary condition equation at the bubble interface to
relate the liquid pressure, Pl, to the gas pressure inside
the bubble. Like all previous authors, Prosperetti and
Lezzi [5] used the following incompressible equation for
this purpose:

where, Pg, µ, and σ are gas pressure at the bubble in-
terface, liquid viscosity coeﬃcient, and surface tension,

respectively. Most of the previously obtained equations
belong to this single parameter family of equations, corre-
sponding to diﬀerent values of η. Moreover, η = 0 yields
results in closest agreement with the numerical simula-
tion of full partial diﬀerential equations [5].

In all previous works [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], an important ap-
proximation has been used in the derivation of the bub-
ble dynamics equations. That is the incompressibility
assumption of the liquid motion at the bubble interface,
which has been used in the derivation of Eq’n. (2). Note
that, all of the eﬀects of the liquid compressibility in all
previous papers have been resulted from the liquid mo-
tion around the bubble, but not from the bubble bound-
ary condition equation. In fact, all previous authors, on
one hand took into account the compressibility of the
liquid motion around the bubble, but on the other hand
neglected its consideration at the bubble interface.

In this paper, we have modiﬁed the bubble dynamics
equations considering the eﬀects of the liquid compress-
ibility at the bubble interface. We have derived a new
bubble boundary equation instead of Eq’n.
(2). The
new equation has new terms resulted from the eﬀects of
bulk viscosity of the liquid and the gas.

To derive the compressible bubble boundary equation,
the continuity equation and the radial component of the
stress tensor under the spherical symmetric condition can
be written as:

where, ρ, u, p, and ∆ are density, velocity, pressure, and

bulk viscosity coeﬃcient and is deﬁned by µb = λ+ 2µ/3,

Equation (9) represents the bubble boundary equation
containing all eﬀects of the compressibility and the vis-
cosity of both the liquid and the gas. Comparison of
Eq’ns. (2) and (9) indicates the existence of three new
terms in Eq’n. (9) due to the liquid and the gas com-
pressibility and viscosity eﬀects. Here, we concentrate
on the eﬀects of the new term arising from the liquid
compressibility. Therefore, we neglect the gas viscosity
because of its smallness relative to the liquid viscosity as
in previous works [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Under this circumstance,
Eq’n. (9) becomes:

It should be mentioned that, although the eﬀects of com-
pressibility consideration in Eq’n.
(1) are in the ﬁrst
order approximation, but these eﬀects have been intro-
duced completely in Eq’n. (10).

To close the mathematical analysis, the gas pressure
evolution at the bubble interface, Pg, must be speciﬁed.
In the most complete approach, it can be determined
from the simultaneous solution of the conservation equa-
tions for the bubble interior and the bubble radius equa-
tions [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Also, heat conduction and mass
exchange between the bubble and the surrounding liquid
aﬀect the bubble evolution. In addition, chemical reac-
tions occurring in the high temperature conditions at the
end of the collapse, change the bubble content [13, 14].
All these complexities have been considered in a complete
gas dynamics model by Storey and Szeri [15].

On the other hand, strong spatial inhomogeneities in-
side the bubble are not remarkably revealed, unless at
the end of an intense collapse [10, 11]. Therefore, the
uniformity assumption for the bubble interior seems to
be useful and provides many features of the bubble mo-
tion [16, 17]. Using this assumption, recently, Lohse and
his coworkers presented an ODE model [18, 19, 20], in
which all eﬀects of heat transfer at the bubble interface,
phase change of water vapor, chemical reactions, and dif-
fusion of reaction products have been considered. This
model accurately describes various experimental phase
diagrams [19] and provides a good agreement with the
complete direct numerical simulation of Storey and Szeri
[15, 18].

Here, for describing the bubble interior evolution, we
have used the Lohse’s group model (the same as what
has been presented in Ref. [20]). We do not repeat this
model here and for more details we refer to Refs. [19, 20].
The calculations were carried out under the framework of
Eq’n (1), (η = 0), for both the new compressible (Eq’n.
10) and the old incompressible (Eq’n. 2) boundary con-
ditions. We describe an argon bubble in water at room
temperature, T0 = 293.0 K, and atmosphere pressure,
P0 = 1.0 atm, under the conditions of Single Bubble
Sonoluminescence [16, 17]. The driving pressure was
Pa(t) = Pa sin (ωt), where ω = 2π × 26.5 kHz. The con-
stants and the parameters were set accordingly [21]; ρ =
998.0 kg/m3, C = 1483.0 m/s, µ = 1.01 × 10−3 kg/ms,
σ = 0.0707 kgs−2. The bulk viscosity of water at room
temperature was set to be µb = 4.1 × 10−3 kg/ms [22].
The constants and parameters of the gas evolution model
were set the same as what has been presented in Ref. [20].
Figures (1) and (2) illustrate the variations of the
bubble characteristics (radius, total number of particle
species, and temperature), for the two boundary condi-
tion cases. It is observed that the addition of the new vis-
cous term in Eq’n. (10) considerably changes the bubble
evolution after the collapse. The bubble motion is re-
markably compressible during the collapse. Therefore,
the new viscous term, which has been arisen from the
liquid compressibility, is important in this time interval.
This term exhibits a damping role and its consideration
reduces the amplitude of the bubble rebounds. Also, the
period of the rebounds decreases with the addition of

temperature, mole fraction of H2O and reaction prod-
ucts, and minimum radius), for the two boundary condi-
tion cases. The ambient radius was ﬁxed (R0 = 5.0 µm).
Figure 3(a) shows that the peak temperature in the both
cases grows as the driving pressure is increased. How-
ever, the rate of increase of the peak temperature for the
new case is considerably smaller than that of the old one.
This causes that the diﬀerence between the two cases be-
comes remarkable for the higher driving pressures (about
50% for Pa = 1.5 atm).

The bubble temperature at the end of the collapse is
high enough to destroy the chemical bonds of water va-
por molecules inside the bubble. The products of the dis-
sociation of water vapor molecules are mainly H2, OH,
H, O, and O2. The chemical reactions between the par-
ticle species existing inside the bubble aﬀect the bub-
ble content at the collapse and its peak temperature
[13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Here, we have considered
the eﬀects of the reactions No. 1-8 of Refs. [14, 19]. The
dependence of the mole fraction of H2O plus reactions
products, which is deﬁned as (Ntot − NAr)/Ntot, to the
driving pressure for the two boundary condition cases has
been illustrated in Fig. 3(b). It shows that the mole frac-
tion of H2O plus reactions products is similar for the two
cases in low amplitudes. The diﬀerence appears for the
higher deriving pressures. It is seen that, for the higher
deriving pressures, the eﬀect of H2O and reactions prod-
ucts is more important in the new case relative to the old
one.

Figure 3(c) shows the variations of the minimum ra-
dius as a function of Pa, for the two cases. The trend
of variations is similar for the two cases. But, the min-
imum radius for the new equation is more than that of
the old equation because of the reduction of the collapse
intensity.

A major deﬁciency of the old bubble dynamics equa-
tions is that for strongly driven bubbles, such as sonolu-
minescence bubbles, large amplitude rebounds are pro-
duced after the collapse, so that they often last until the
next acoustic cycle of the periodic driving pressure. This

pressible cases. (b) Details of the bubble rebounds after the

the new term. Details of our calculations show that the
minimum radius for the new case is about 10% greater
than that of the old one. The diﬀerence between the two
cases also appears on the variations of the total number
of particle species (Ar and H2O plus reactions products)
after the collapse (Fig. 1c). Note that, the diﬀerence
gradually disappears as the bubble rebounds weaken.

In Fig. (2), details of the gas temperature evolution
around the minimum radius have been demonstrated.
Damping feature of the new term is clearly observed by
a considerable decrease of the peak temperature (about
50%) and an increase of the temperature pulse width, at
the collapse time. Also, the time of the peak temperature
about 5 ns changes with the addition of the new term.

Figure (3) represents the eﬀects of variations of Pa on
the bubble characteristics at the end of the collapse (peak

is in contrast with the experimental results, which show
rapidly damped rebounds [23]. By introducing a damp-
ing term arisen from the gas compressibility, Moss et. al
[23] provided a typical solution for this problem. The
eﬀects of the suggested term by Moss et. al is very simi-
lar to the damping eﬀects of the new term in this paper,
(compare Fig. 1(b) with Figs. (3) and (4) of Ref. [23]).
It seems that the damping feature of the bulk viscosity
is a better way for solving the mentioned problem. The
reason is that Eq’n. (10) has been derived directly from
the basic equations of ﬂuid mechanics, on the contrary
to Eq’n.
[23], which was derived by an
approximate method.

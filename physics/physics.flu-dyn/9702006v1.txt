We show that any generic non-adiabatic slow ﬂow of ideal compressible ﬂuid develops a signiﬁcant
vorticity. As an example, an initially irrotational conductive cooling ﬂow (CF) is considered. A
perturbation theory for the vorticity generation is developed that employs, as a zero order solution,
a novel two-dimensional similarity solution. Full gasdynamic simulations of this CF demonstrate
the vorticity generation and support the theory. The relevance of this problem to the experiments
with the “hot channels” is discussed.

The most general mechanism of the vorticity produc-
tion in non-adiabatic ﬂows of ideal compressible ﬂuids
relies on the misalignment of pressure and density gradi-
ents [1]. Recent experiments with supersonic ﬂows [2,3]
have clearly demonstrated the eﬃciency of this mecha-
nism (which is called baroclinic). The baroclinic mecha-
nism can also operate in slow gas ﬂows, and its speciﬁc
manifestations in meteorology [1] and combustion [4] are
known. The main objective of this Letter is to show that
the vorticity production represents a generic and signiﬁ-
cant property of any slow non-adiabatic gas ﬂow.

For concreteness, we will consider the conductive cool-
ing ﬂows (CFs) and refer to the “hot channels” produced
in the air by lasers or electric discharges [5,6]. After
pressure equilibration these channels develop a signiﬁ-
cant vorticity and small scale turbulence and cool much
faster than they would because of molecular thermal con-
duction. Picone and Boris [7] interpreted these results in
terms of the baroclinic vorticity production during the
rapid channel expansion (that is, on the acoustic time
scale) [8]. Schlieren photographs of the hot channels [5,6]
clearly show that the most signiﬁcant vorticity dynamics
occurs on a much longer time scale. According to Picone
and Boris, ”after pressure equilibration... vorticity is no
longer generated, however, signiﬁcant residual vorticity
exists” [7]. We wish to present an alternative scenario
which assumes that a signiﬁcant vorticity is created on
the long, heat-conduction time scale. The underlying
physics is the following. After a few acoustic times, fol-
lowing the rapid energy release, the gas pressure becomes
very close to the (constant) ambient pressure, while the
vorticity generated earlier is presumably damped out. As
the temperature inside the channel is still very high, a
low-Mach-number conductive CF develops that cools the
channel by ﬁlling it with the cold gas from the periphery.
Slow conductive CFs were studied previously in the con-
text of a “point-like” energy release, like a high-altitude
explosion in the atmosphere [9] or “ﬁreball” produced by
a laser spark in front of condensed matter [10]. We will
show that, unless the energy release geometry is fully
symmetrical, small pressure gradients, intrinsic in the
CF, result in a signiﬁcant vorticity production.

The simplest conductive CF of a perfect gas is de-

scribed by the standard gasdynamic equations [11]:

where d/dt = ∂/∂t + v · ∇ is the total derivative. The
distance is measured in the units of a characteristic spa-
tial scale of the problem r0 (see later), while the time
is measured in the units of the heat conduction time
τ0 = γ(γ − 1)−1Rgρ0r2
. Furthermore, the gas
density ρ and temperature T are scaled by their (pre-
sumably constant) values ”at inﬁnity” ρ0 and T0, the
velocity v is scaled by r0/τ0, and the pressure p = ρT is
scaled by (Rg/µ)ρ0T0. The non-dimensional parameter
ǫ = r0/csτ0 (where c2
s = RgT0/µ) represents the char-
acteristic Mach number of the ﬂow. Finally, Rg, γ and
µ are the gas constant, adiabatic index and molar mass,
respectively, while the heat conductivity is assumed to
be a power-like function of the temperature: κT ν in the
scaled units, κ = const. (For the molecular air ν = 1/2.)
We start with a perturbation theory that describes the
initial stage of the vorticity production. Then we report
on numerical simulations with the full equations (1)-(3)
that show the vorticity generation in the same CF and
support the theory.

In the low Mach number regime, ǫ2 ≪ 1, the tem-
perature and density contrasts can still be large, but
pressure non-uniformities are already small: p(r, t) =
1 + ǫ2 δp(r, t). Then, neglecting the small δp terms in Eq.
(3) and equation of state, we obtain ∇ · (v − T ν∇T ) = 0
and ρT = 1, respectively. It follows that v = vp + vs,
where vp = −ρ−ν−2∇ρ is the irrotational component of
the ﬂuid velocity, and vs is the solenoidal component:
∇ · vs = 0. Substitution of v into Eq. (1) yields a non-
linear transport equation:

1

where r and φ are the polar coordinates in the plane xy,
and A and k are constants. In the case of a cylindrically-
symmetric [f (φ) = 1] explosion along the z-axis, this
proﬁle with k = 2/(γ − 1) represents the r → 0 den-
sity asymptotics that sets in at the end of the expansion
stage [14,15]. The function f (φ) describes asymmetry.
In analogy to Ref. [9], we extend this initial condition
to the whole CF region. This idealization is justiﬁed (see
Refs. [10,9] and gasdynamic simulations below) as long as
the density (temperature) contrast in the system remains
much larger than unity.

The initial condition yields β = (νk + k + 2)−1. Using
Eq. (9), one arrives at a nonlinear elliptic equation for
the shape function R(ξ, η):

(we got rid of the constant A by choosing r0 = A1/k). We
assume for simplicity that the initial density proﬁle [and,
hence, R(ξ, η)] is symmetric with respect to each of the
Cartesian axes and solve Eq. (10) in the ﬁrst quadrant
with the no-ﬂux boundary conditions at the ξ- and η-
axes. In addition, we must require that R(ξ → ∞, η →
∞) = ˆrkf ( ˆφ), where ˆr and ˆφ are the polar coordinates
in the plane ξ, η. Fig. 1 shows R(ξ, η) found numerically
in a ﬁnite square for f ( ˆφ) = 1 + a cos 2 ˆφ. We took the
usual values γ = 1.4 and ν = 0.5 for the molecular air,
and chose a = 0.6. (In this case β = 2/19, while the gas
density at the channel axis grows in time like t10/19.)

An important additional equation follows from Eq. (2):

∇ρ).

(5)

where ~ω = ∇ × v ≡ ∇ × vs is the vorticity. Eq. (5) is
equivalent to the well-known vorticity equation [1], as its
right-hand-side can be rewritten as ∇ρ × ∇δp/ρ2. Note
that Eq. (5) does not include ǫ, therefore, the vorticity
production rate is, in general, of order unity.

In this Letter we address the vorticity production in
an initially curl-free ﬂow. Accordingly, we assume that
vs ≪ vp and, in the zero order, neglect the second term in
the left side of Eq. (4). The resulting nonlinear diﬀusion
equation,

∂ρ
∂t

= ∇ · (ρ

−ν−1∇ρ),

(6)

describes such a curl-free CF completely [9,10]. Now we
consider a ﬁrst-order version of Eq.
(5), rewritten in
terms of the vector ﬁeld a(r, t) = ∂vs/∂t:

∇ × a +

+ (vp · ∇)vp

(cid:21)

with ρ and vp given by the curl-free solution [12]. Again,
Eq. (7) shows that for a generic CF the vorticity produc-
tion rate is of order unity. Therefore, the solenoidal part
of the velocity ﬁeld ﬁnally becomes comparable to its ir-
rotational part (at which stage this perturbation scheme
breaks down).

Let us concentrate on a two-dimensional (2d) ﬂow in
the xy-plane with no z-dependence, where one can pro-
duce the ﬁrst two “classes of asymmetries” of the hot
channels [7]: (i) oﬀ-center laser beam propagation and
(ii) non-circular cross section of the beam. Introduce a
modiﬁed stream function ψ(x, y, t), so that ax = −∂ψ/∂y
and ay = ∂ψ/∂x. Eq. (7) becomes a scalar equation for
ψ:

∇ · (ρ∇ψ) =

(cid:19)

(cid:21)

where ez is the unit vector in the z-direction.

One should, however, deal ﬁrst with Eq. (6) and ﬁnd
the zero-order solutions ρ(x, y, t) and vp(x, y, t) enter-
ing Eq. (8). Remarkably, Eq. (6) has a family of 2d-
similarity solutions of the second kind:

where ξ = x/tβ, η = y/tβ, and β is an arbitrary real pa-
rameter [13]. Selection of parameter β requires the use
of initial or boundary conditions. We shall adopt the fol-
lowing initial density proﬁle: ρ(x, y, t = 0) = A−1rkf (φ),

Now we return to Eq. (8). A similarity solution for
ρ implies a similarity solution for ψ, that is ψ(x, y, t) =
t−αΨ(ξ, η), where α = 2(νk + k + 1)/(νk + k + 2). For

the shape function Ψ(ξ, η) one obtains a linear elliptic
equation ∇ · (R∇Ψ) = (W × ∇R) · ez, where

V = −R−ν−2∇R, and the ∇-operator now involves dif-
ferentiation with respect to ξ and η. This equation should
be solved in the ﬁrst quadrant with the Dirichlet bound-
ary condition. We solved it numerically using the shape
function R found earlier (in this case α = 34/19 ≈ 1.79).
The result is shown in Fig.
2. Now we can evalu-
ate the vorticity ~ω = ω(x, y, t) ez, using the relation
(∂ω/∂t)x,y = ∇2ψ. Following Picone and Boris [7], we
calculate the vorticity ﬂux Ω through the ﬁrst quadrant
as a function of time. The growth rate of this quantity,
dΩ/dt, is equal to

Now we report on the 2d-numerical simulations with
Eqs.
(1)-(3). We employed an extended version of
the code VULCAN [16] that uses ﬂexible moving grids
and can operate in any combination of Eulerian and
Lagrangian modes.
In the rezoning stage we used the
scheme of Van Leer [17] that preserves second order ac-
curacy. The code could work in an implicit mode, thus
eliminating the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy restriction on
the time step. The initial conditions were

ρ(r, φ, t = 0) ≡ ρin =

δ + rk(1 + a cos 2φ)
1 + rk(1 + a cos 2φ)

,

(14)

−ν−2
for the density, v(r, φ, t = 0) = −ρ
in ∇ρin for the ve-
locity, and unity for the pressure. For δ ≪ 1, the ini-
tial density proﬁle has an extended part described by
rk(1 + a cos 2φ) (which yields the 2d-similarity solution).
On the other hand, ρin is non-zero at r = 0 and ap-
proaches unity at r → ∞ as it should. In most of simula-
tions we took δ = 10−2, a = 0.6 and ǫ in the range of 10−6
to 10−5. Simulations show that the density history at the
channel axis is described very well by the similarity scal-
ing 1.99 (t+4.2×10−5)10/19 until the late stage, when the
density contrast is reduced. However, the velocity ﬁeld
(that was curl-free in the beginning, Fig. 3a) develops
a noticeable vorticity which spatial structure is similar
to that shown in Fig. 2. Finally, a distinctive vortex,
advected towards the origin by the overdense gas inﬂow,
appears (Fig. 3b). Since the problem is symmetric with
respect to each of the axes, the corresponding ”full” ﬂow
develops four symmetric vortices. Fig. 4 shows the time
history of the vorticity ﬂux through the ﬁrst quadrant,
Ω, as found from the simulations. It is seen that the vor-
ticity reaches a signiﬁcant value. One can also see that
the perturbation theory [Eq.
(13)] underestimates the
saturated vorticity ﬂux. This is understandable, as the
perturbation scheme fails at large times.
Interestingly,
the agreement improves for a smaller value of t0.

In summary, we claim that any generic non-adiabatic
gas ﬂow develops a signiﬁcant vorticity. For the low-
Mach-number conductive CF that we have considered in
detail, the further vorticity dynamics (instability?) is ap-
parently sensitive to geometry (like in the Picone-Boris
scenario). We did not observe turbulence or other signiﬁ-
cant modiﬁcation of the bulk transport properties in this
(still highly symmetric) 2d-ﬂow. Correspondingly, the
“hot channel” riddle requires further investigation. One
can expect turbulence to show up in a less symmetric 3d
situation, when perturbations along the channel axis are
introduced.

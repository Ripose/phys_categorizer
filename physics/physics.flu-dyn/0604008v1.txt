We consider ﬁnite–amplitude Kelvin waves on an inviscid vortex assuming that the vortex core
has inﬁnitesimal thickness. By numerically solving the governing Biot–Savart equation of motion,
we study how the frequency of the Kelvin waves and the velocity of the perturbed ring depend on
the Kelvin wave amplitude. In particular, we show that, if the amplitude of the Kelvin waves is
suﬃciently large, the perturbed vortex ring moves backwards. We call this new structure the crab
vortex.

INTRODUCTION

Vortex rings are among the most important and most
studied objects of ﬂuid mechanics [1, 2] It has been known
since the times of Lord Kelvin [3] that a vortex ring is
subject to wavy distortions (sinusoidal displacements of
the vortex core) called Kelvin waves [4].
In the case
of viscous vortex rings, the stability of these waves is a
problem with subtle aspects [5] which are still the focus
of intense mathematical scrutiny[6]. Our concern is the
simpler case in which the ﬂuid is inviscid and the vortex
core has inﬁnitesimal thickness. This case refers to the
idealized context of classical Euler ﬂuids, but is realistic
for superﬂuids, which have zero viscosity and microscopic
vortex core thickness.

Vortex rings have indeed been central to superﬂuidity
[7] since the pioneering experiments on the nucleation of
quantized vorticity by moving ions [8], the early inves-
tigations into rotons as ghosts of vanished vortex rings
[9] and the nature of the superﬂuid transition [10]. The
current interest in superﬂuid vortex rings extends to the
physics of cold atomic gases [11] and the discovery of new
nonlinear solutions [12] of the Gross–Pitaevskii’s nonlin-
ear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) for a Bose–Einstein
condensate. Vortex rings are also important in the study
of superﬂuid turbulence [13]. For example, they have
been used as tools to study the Kelvin wave cascade [14]
which is responsible for the dissipation of turbulent ki-
netic energy near absolute zero, and to investigate the
eﬀects of vortex reconnections [15], which are the key fea-
ture of turbulence; they are also used as simple models
of the vortex loops which make up the turbulence [16].

Kelvin waves play a role in all examples listed above.
The dispersion relation of Kelvin waves of inﬁnitesimal
amplitude A on a circular vortex ring of given radius, R,
circulation, κ, and vortex core radius, a, is [17]

tions of order n. The above dispersion relation is also
valid for waves on a straight vortex [18]. The properties
of small–amplitude Kelvin waves have been already inves-
tigated [19], but little is know of what happens at large
wave amplitude. The stability problem becomes non–
linear, hence more diﬃcult, and a numerical approach is
necessary.

Recently, an astonishing prediction was made by Kik-
nadze and Mamaladze [20] that, at suﬃciently large am-
plitude, the perturbed vortex ring moves backwards. Un-
fortunately the prediction arises from numerical analysis
based on the Local Induction Approximation (LIA) to
the exact equation of motion, which is the Biot–Savart
Law (BSL). The advantage of the LIA over the BSL
is that it is analytically simpler and computationally
cheaper. If N is the number of discretisation points along
a vortex ﬁlament, the cost of the computation grows as
N under the LIA, whereas under the BSL it grows as
N 2. The use of the LIA was pioneered by Schwarz [21]
in his numerical studies of homogeneous isotropic turbu-
lence. His results obtained using the LIA compared rea-
sonably well with results obtained using the BSL, because
long–range eﬀects tend to cancel out in the isotropy vor-
tex conﬁgurations which he considered. In less isotropic
cases however, for example in rotating turbulence [22],
the LIA may not be a good approximation. In particu-
lar, the LIA yields wrong predictions about the stability
and motion of vortex knots [23], structures which are geo-
metrically similar to (although topological diﬀerent from)
the perturbed vortex rings considered by Kiknadze and
Mamaladze [20].

Our ﬁrst aim is thus to use the exact BSL to investigate
the claim of Kiknadze and Mamaladze that perturbed
vortex ring can move backwards [20]. Our second aim is
carry out a more detailed examination of the eﬀects of
large–amplitude Kelvin waves on the motion of a vortex
ring.

Our approach is based on the vortex ﬁlament model
of Schwarz [21] which is appropriate to superﬂuid helium

due to the smallness of the vortex core radius, a, com-
pared to the radius of the vortex ring, R. Essentially, a
vortex is treated as a topological line defect, that is to
say a curve in three-dimensional space. In the absence of
dissipation (zero temperature), the vortex at the point r
moves with velocity dr/dt = vL where vL is equal to the
local superﬂuid velocity vs that is given by the follow-
ing Biot–Savart line integral calculated along the entire
vortex conﬁguration:

vs(r, t) =

κ
4π

(s − r) × ds
|s − r|3

.

(2)

I
Here s denotes a variable location along the vortex ﬁla-
ment. To implement the BSL, the vortex conﬁguration
is discretised into a large number of segments. The tech-
nique to handle the singularity that one meets when one
tries to evaluate the integral at those discrete points that
are used to describe the vortex line can be avoided by
splitting the integral into local and nonlocal parts [21].
The velocity of a point s on the vortex is thus

where ξ is the arc length, the vectors s′ = ds/dξ, s′′ =
d2s/dξ2 are respectively local tangent and local normal
to the vortex at the point s. The quantities l− and l+
are the lengths of the line segments connected to the
discretisation point s and the prime above the integral
symbol means that the line integration now extends only
along the remaining vortex segments. One should note
that we use hollow core vortex, which results that the
scaling factor in front of a in Eq. (3) is exp(1/2) rather
than exp(1/4) which is for solid rotating core and appears
in paper by Schwarz [21]. The exact value of the core size
is not important here. What matters is that it is orders
of magnitudes smaller than the radius of the ring or the
amplitude of the waves, so that we can use the concept
of vortex ﬁlament.

The Local Induction Approximation (LIA) is obtained
by neglecting the nonlocal part and is typically written
in the form:

vL = βs′

× s′′

,

(4)

where β = κ ln(chRi/a)/4π, hRi is some average curva-
ture and c is of order unit; the last two parameters are
adjusted to obtain better agreement with full non-local
calculations. By choosing c = 8 exp(−1/2) and hRi to
be the local radius of curvature one obtains fairly good
results and additionally a limit that gives a correctly the
velocity for the perfect ring.

The calculation of the kinetic energy, E, of the vor-
tex would not be accurate if carried out on a three–
dimensional mesh around the vortex due to rapid changes
of the velocity ﬁeld near the vortex core. Fortunately in

2

our case the vortex ﬁlament forms a closed loop and the
velocity ﬁeld goes to zero at inﬁnity (the calculation is
performed in an inﬁnite box), hence it is appropriate [24]
to use Saﬀman’s formula [2]

E = κρs

vs · s × ds,

(5)

I

where the line integration is performed along the vortex
ﬁlament and ρs is the superﬂuid density.

The initial condition consists of a vortex ring of radius
R with superimposed N Kelvin waves of amplitude A
(that is, the wavelength of the perturbation is 2πR/N ).
Using cylindrical coordinates r, φ, and z, the Cartesian
coordinates of the initial vortex ring are thus

x = R cos(φ) + A cos(N φ) cos(φ)
y = R sin(φ) + A cos(N φ) sin(φ)
z = −A sin(N φ).

(6)

In the absence of Kelvin waves (A = 0) the circular
vortex ring moves in the positive z direction with self–
induced translational speed[25]

vring =

[ln (8R/a) − 1/2]

(7)

κ
4πR

We have tested that, in the case of a circular ring, our
numerical method agrees fairly well with this result.
All results presented here are obtained using ring radius
R = 0.1cm and values of a and κ which refer to 4He
(κ = ~/m4 = 9.97 × 10−4cm2/s, where m4 is the mass
of one atom, and a = 1.0 × 10−8cm. The dependence of
the results on a is small, since a appears only in the slow
varying logarithmic term in Eq. (3).

The numerical method to evolve the perturbed vortex
ring under the BSL is based on a fourth–order Runge–
Kutta scheme. The spatial discretisation is typically
∆ξ/R = 0.02 and the time step ∆t = 0.5 × 10−3s. The
time step is well below the one that for a given space res-
olution provides stable motion of a circular vortex ring
without ﬂuctuations and resolves the oscillations of the
Kelvin waves. Numerical calculations are also performed
using the LIA to compare against the exact BSL.

We are unable to perform a precise stability analysis
of large–amplitude Kelvin waves under the Biot–Savart
Law or a stability analysis of the Runge-Kutta scheme
when applied to the Biot–Savart motion - both problems
are practically impossible. We ﬁnd that for very large
times (larger then reported in the following section) the
perturbed vortex ring always breaks up at some point
(that is, ﬁrst deforms and later possibly attempts to re-
connect with itself). We do not know whether this fate
indicates an instability of the vortex for large–amplitude
Kelvin waves or a numerical instability. What matters is
that the lifetime of the perturbed vortex and the spatial
range that it travels are much larger than the timescale
of the Kelvin oscillations and the size of the ring itself,
because it implies that the results which we describe are
physically signiﬁcant and observable in a real system.

amplitude A taken during the motion of the vortex. In the left
panel (a) the amplitude of the Kelvin waves is small, A/R =
0.05, but the perturbed vortex ring (red color) already moves
slower than the unperturbed vortex (blue color). In the center
panel (b) the Kelvin waves have large amplitude, A/R = 0.35,
and the perturbed vortex ring moves backwards (negative z
direction) on average. The top right panel (c) shows the top

vortex is shown with dashed line (green). The lower right
panel (d) gives the averaged location of the ring as a function
of time. From top to bottom the curves correspond to A/R

III. RESULTS

The ﬁrst result of our numerical simulations is that
Kiknadze and Mamaladze’s prediction [20] obtained us-
ing the LIA is indeed correct. Integration of the motion
using the exact BSL shows that, provided the amplitude
of the Kelvin waves is large enough, the vortex ring moves
(on the average) backwards. This result is illustrated in
Figs. 1 and 2: the former shows snapshots of the ring at
diﬀerent times as it travels, the latter gives the average
translational velocity of the ring along the z direction as
a function of the amplitude A of the Kelvin waves. It
is apparent that the translational velocity decreases with
increasing amplitude of the Kelvin waves and can even
become negative.

At some critical value of the amplitude A the trans-
lational velocity is zero and the perturbed vortex ring
hovers like a stationary helicopter. In the case of N = 10
Kelvin waves this happens when A/R = 0.17 approxi-
mately. For N = 6 and N = 20 the critical value is
respectively A/R = 0.32 and A/R = 0.085. This depen-
dence of the critical amplitude on N is in approximate
agreement with the LIA prediction [20].

The backward velocity of the perturbed vortex ring
depends nonlinearly on the amplitude A of the Kelvin
waves. At large enough amplitude A this velocity will
slow down. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 2. The Kelvin

FIG. 2: Average translational velocity of the vortex ring as
a function of the initial oscillation amplitude A/R. Velocity
is scaled by the velocity of the unperturbed ring, vring. The
dash-dotted line corresponds to N = 20, solid line to N = 10,
and the dashed line to N = 6 in Eq. 7. Critical amplitudes,
above which the velocities become negative, are A/R = 0.085,
0.17, and 0.32, respectively.

waves, that can be imagined to behave like small vortex
rings, tend to turn backwards, or more precisely, on the
direction opposite to the motion of the unperturbed vor-
tex ring. The larger the amplitude the larger fraction
of the ring velocity is oriented downwards. This is com-
pensated by the decrease in velocity of the single ring,
which is inversely proportional to the amplitude, result-
ing an optimum value at some amplitude. For N = 20
the optimum amplitude A ≈ 0.25R resulting a downward
velocity that is already slightly higher than the velocity
upwards of the unperturbed ring.
The dispersion relation of

large–amplitude Kelvin
waves can be obtained by tracking the motion of the vor-
tex on the y = 0 plane for example. If the amplitude A of
the Kelvin wave is small, the vortex draws a circle at ap-
proximately the same angular frequency that is obtained
analytically for small–amplitude Kelvin waves and given
by Eq. (1). In the long wave length limit (k → 0) this
relation becomes

where γ = 0.5772 . . . is Euler’s constant and the negative
sign only indicates that the Kelvin waves rotate oppo-
site to the circulation. Again the above equation diﬀers
slightly (−γ in stead of 1/4 − γ) from the form given by
Schwarz [21], but this is again only due to the deﬁnition
of the core type.

We ﬁnd that if we increase the amplitude of the Kelvin
waves on the ring then the angular frequency decreases,
a result which we also veriﬁed in the case of a straight
vortex. Some example curves drawn by the vortex on
the y = 0 plane are shown in Fig. 3. The average an-
gular frequency is plotted in Fig. 4, which shows also

comparison.

It is important to notice that, under the LIA used by
Kiknadze and Mamaladze [20] the vortex length remains
constant [21], whereas the quantity which is conserved
under the exact BSL is the energy. Length and energy
are proportional to each other only if the vortex ﬁlament
is straight, which is not the case in our problem.
In-
deed, further investigation reveals that the vortex motion
contains two characteristic frequencies. The ﬁrst is the
Kelvin frequency and the second is the frequency that is
related to the oscillations of the vortex length and illus-
trated in Fig. 5. If the ratio of the two periods is rational
one observes a fully periodic motion (in addition to trans-
lational motion along the z axis). At some values of the
amplitudes which we calculated, this condition is almost
satisﬁed. At higher values of amplitude one observes that
the average radius of the vortex ring oscillates, as shown
in Fig. 1. These variations in the total length were ob-
served but not discussed in a recent calculation of the
motion of vortex rings using the NLSE model [26].

The accuracy of our numerical method is tested by
calculating the energy of the vortex ring. At zero tem-
perature, without any dissipation, the energy (and the
momentum) should remain constant. This condition can

small oscillations in energy but we have checked that by
increasing the space resolution we can reduce them at

of the numerical resolution.

IV. CONCLUSION

It is well known that a circular vortex ring has a trans-
lational velocity which arises from its own curvature (the
smaller the radius R of the ring, the faster the ring trav-
els). Using the exact Biot–Savart Law, we have analysed
the motion of a vortex ring perturbed by Kelvin waves of
ﬁnite amplitude. We have found that the translational
velocity of the perturbed ring decreases with increasing
amplitude; at some critical amplitude the velocity be-
comes zero, that is, the vortex ring hovers like a heli-
copter. A further increase of the amplitude changes the
sign of the translational velocity, that is, the vortex ring
moves backward. This is why we name the new vortex
structure the crab vortex. Our ﬁnding conﬁrms prelimi-
nary results obtained by Kiknadze and Mamaladze using
the Local Induction Approximation [20].

This remarkable eﬀect is due to the tilt of the plane of
the Kelvin waves which induce motion in the ”wrong” di-
rection. The magnitude of the tilt oscillates what results

is a wobbly translational motion in the backward direc-
tion. We have also found that the frequency of the Kelvin
wave decreases with increasing amplitude and that the
total length of the perturbed vortex ring oscillates with
time. This oscillation in vortex length is related to the
ocillation of the tilt angle.

Time of ﬂight measurements of

large, electrically
charged, perturbed vortex rings in 4He could easily de-
tect the crab vortex eﬀect. Another context in which
the eﬀect can be studied is Bose–Einstein condensation
in ultra–cold atomic gases, which allow simple visualisa-
tion of individual vortex structures. For these systems,
however, it would be necessary to assess the eﬀect of the
non–homogeneity of the superﬂuid.

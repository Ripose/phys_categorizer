We study the dynamo threshold of a helical ﬂow made of a mean (stationary)

plus a ﬂuctuating part. Two ﬂow geometries are studied, either (i) solid body or

(ii) smooth. Two well-known resonant dynamo conditions, elaborated for stationary

helical ﬂows in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, are tested against lower

magnetic Reynolds numbers and for ﬂuctuating ﬂows (zero mean). For a ﬂow made

of a mean plus a ﬂuctuating part the dynamo threshold depends on the frequency

and the strength of the ﬂuctuation. The resonant dynamo conditions applied on the

ﬂuctuating (resp. mean) part seems to be a good diagnostic to predict the existence

of a dynamo threshold when the ﬂuctuation level is high (resp. low).

INTRODUCTION

2

In the context of recent dynamo experiments [1, 2, 3], an important question is to identify

the relevant physical parameters which control the dynamo threshold and eventually min-

imize it. In addition to the parameters usually considered, like the geometry of the mean

ﬂow [4, 5] or the magnetic boundary conditions [6, 7], the turbulent ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow

seem to have an important inﬂuence on the dynamo threshold [8, 9, 10, 11]. Some recent

experimental results [12, 13] suggest that the large spatial scales of these ﬂuctuations could

play a decisive role.

In this paper we consider a ﬂow of large spatial scale, ﬂuctuating periodically in time,

such that its geometry at some given time is helical. Such helical ﬂows have been identiﬁed

to produce dynamo action [14, 15]. Their eﬃciency has been studied in the context of fast

dynamo theory [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] and they have led to the realization of several dynamo

experiments [3, 22, 23, 24].

The dynamo mechanism of a helical dynamo is of stretch-diﬀuse type. The radial com-

ponent Br of the magnetic ﬁeld is stretched to produce a helical ﬁeld (0, Bθ, Bz), where

(r, θ, z) are the cylindrical coordinates. The magnetic diﬀusion of the azimuthal component

Bθ produces some radial component Br due to the cylindrical geometry of the problem [17].

In this paper we shall consider two cases, depending on the type of ﬂow shear necessary for

In case (i) the helical ﬂow is solid body for r < 1 and at rest for r > 1 (the same

conductivity is assumed in both domains). The ﬂow shear is then inﬁnite and localized at

the discontinuity surface r = 1. Gilbert [17] has shown that this dynamo is fast (positive

growth rate in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds number) and thus very eﬃcient to

generate a helical magnetic ﬁeld of same pitch as the ﬂow. In case (ii) the helical ﬂow is

continuous, and equal to zero for r ≥ 1. The ﬂow shear is then ﬁnite at any point. Gilbert

[17] has shown that such a smooth helical ﬂow is a slow dynamo and that the dynamo action

is localized at a resonant layer r = r0 such that 0 < r0 < 1. Contrary to case (i), having a

conducting external medium is here not necessary.

In both cases some resonant conditions leading to dynamo action have been derived

[16, 17, 18, 20, 21]. Such resonant conditions can be achieved by choosing an appropriate

geometry of the helical ﬂow, like changing its geometrical pitch. They have been derived

for a stationary ﬂow U(r, θ, z) and can be generalized to a time-dependent ﬂow of the form

(cid:101)U(r, θ, z) · f (t) where f (t) is a periodic function of time. Now taking a ﬂow composed of a

mean part U plus a ﬂuctuating part (cid:101)U · f (t), we expect the dynamo threshold to depend on

the geometry of each part of the ﬂow accordingly to the resonant condition of each of them

and to the ratio of the intensities | (cid:101)U|/|U|. However we shall see that in some cases even a

small intensity of the ﬂuctuating part may have a drastic inﬂuence. The results also depend

on the frequency of f (t).

The Ponomarenko dynamo (case(i)) ﬂuctuating periodically in time and with a ﬂuctua-

tion of inﬁnitesimal magnitude had already been the object of a perturbative approach [25].

Here we consider a ﬂuctuation of arbitrary magnitude. Comparing our results for a small

ﬂuctuation magnitude with those obtained with the perturbative approach, we found signif-

icant diﬀerences. Then we realized that there was an error in the computation of the results

published in [25](though the perturbative development in itself is correct).

In Appendix

VI E we give a corrigendum of these results.

II. MODEL

We consider a dimensionless ﬂow deﬁned in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) by

U = (0, rΩ(r, t), V (r, t)) · h(r) with h(r) =

corresponding to a helical ﬂow in a cylindrical cavity which is inﬁnite in the z-direction, the

external medium being at rest. Each component, azimuthal and vertical, of the dimensionless

velocity is deﬁned as the sum of a stationary part and of a ﬂuctuating part

(2)

where Rm and Γ (resp. (cid:101)Rm and (cid:101)Γ) are the magnetic Reynolds number and a characteristic

pitch of the stationary (resp. ﬂuctuating) part of the ﬂow. In what follows we consider a

ﬂuctuation periodic in time, in the form f (t) = cos(ωf t). Depending on the radial proﬁles

of the functions ξ and ζ we determine two cases (i) solid body and (ii) smooth ﬂow

ξ = ζ = 1

(ii)

ξ = 1 − r, ζ = 1 − r2.

We note here that the magnetic Reynolds numbers are deﬁned with the maximum angular

velocity (either mean or ﬂuctuating part) and the radius of the moving cylinder. Thinking

of an experiment, it would not be suﬃcient to minimize the magnitude of the azimuthal

ﬂow. In particular if Γ is large (considering a steady ﬂow for simplicity), one would have

to spend too many megawatts in forcing the z-velocity. Therefore the reader interested in

linking our results to experiments should bear in mind that our magnetic Reynolds number

is not totally adequate for it. A better deﬁnition of the magnetic Reynolds number could

be for example ˆRm = Rm

(cid:113)

2
1 + Γ

. For a stationary ﬂow of type (i), the minimum dynamo

threshold ˆRm is obtained for Γ = 1.3.

5

Both cases (i) and (ii) diﬀer in the conductivity of the external medium r > 1. In case

(i) the magnetic generation being in a cylindrical layer in the neighbourhood of r = 1, a

conducting external medium is necessary for dynamo action. For simplicity we choose the

same conductivity as the inner ﬂuid. In the other hand, in case (ii) the magnetic generation

being within the ﬂuid, a conducting external medium is not necessary for dynamo action,

thus we choose an isolating external medium. Though the choice of the conductivity of the

external medium is far from being insigniﬁcant for a dynamo experiment [3, 4, 6, 7], we

expect that it does not change the overall meaning of the results given below.

We deﬁne the magnitude ratio of the ﬂuctuation to the mean ﬂow by ρ = (cid:101)Rm/Rm. For

ρ = 0 there is no ﬂuctuation and the dynamo threshold is given by Rm. In the other hand

for ρ (cid:29) 1 the ﬂuctuation dominates and the relevant quantity to determine the threshold

is (cid:101)Rm = ρRm. The perturbative approach of Normand [25] correspond to ρ (cid:28) 1.

The magnetic ﬁeld must satisfy the induction equation

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (U × B) + ∇2B.

(5)

where the dimensionless time t is given in units of the magnetic diﬀusion time, implying

that the ﬂow frequency ωf is also a dimensionless quantity. As the velocity does not depend

on θ nor z, each magnetic mode in θ and z is independent from the others. Therefore we

can look for a solution in the form

B(r, t) = exp i(mθ + kz)b(r, t)

(6)

where m and k are the azimuthal and vertical wave numbers of the ﬁeld. The solenoidality

At the interface r = 1, both B and the z-component of the electric ﬁeld E = ∇ × B − U × B

are continuous. The continuity of Br and Bθ imply that of b±. The continuity of B and (7)

imply the continuity of b(cid:48)

implies the continuity of Db± at r = 1.

In summary, we calculate for both cases (i) and (ii) the growth rate

γ = γ(m, k, Γ, (cid:101)Γ, Rm, (cid:101)Rm, ωf )

(12)

of the kinematic dynamo problem and look for the dynamo threshold (either Rm or (cid:101)Rm)

such that the real part (cid:60)γ of γ is zero. In our numerical simulations we shall take m = 1

for it leads to the lowest dynamo threshold.

In case (i) we set

For mathematical convenience, we take (cid:101)µ = 0 . Then the non stationary part of the velocity

does not occur in (14) any more. It occurs only in the expression of the boundary conditions

(11) that can be written in the form

(Rm + (cid:101)Rmf (t))(b+ + b−)r=1 = 0.

Taking (cid:101)µ = 0 corresponds to a pitch of the magnetic ﬁeld equal to the pitch of the

ﬂuctuating part of the ﬂow −m/k = (cid:101)Γ. In the other hand it is not necessarily equal to

the pitch of the mean ﬂow (except if Γ = (cid:101)Γ). In addition we shall consider two situations

depending on whether the mean ﬂow is zero (Rm = 0) or not. The method used to solve

the equations (14) and (15) is given in Appendix VI A.

At this stage we can make two remarks. First, according to boundary layer theory results

[16, 17] and for a stationary ﬂow, in the limit of large Rm the magnetic ﬁeld which has the

highest growth rate satisﬁes µ ≈ 0. This resonant condition means that the pitch of the

magnetic ﬁeld is roughly equal to the pitch of the ﬂow. We shall see in section III A that

this stays true even at the dynamo threshold. Though the case of a ﬂuctuating ﬂow of type

(cid:101)U·f (t) may be more complex with possibly skin eﬀect, the resonant condition is presumably

analogous, writing (cid:101)µ ≈ 0. This means that setting (cid:101)µ = 0 implies that if the ﬂuctuations

8

are suﬃciently large (ρ (cid:29) 1), dynamo action is always possible. This is indeed what will

be found in our results. In other words, setting (cid:101)µ = 0, we cannot tackle the situation of a

stationary dynamo ﬂow to which a ﬂuctuation acting against the dynamo would be added.

This aspect will be studied with the smooth ﬂow (ii).

Our second remark is about the eﬀect of a phase lag between the azimuthal and vertical

components of the ﬂow ﬂuctuation. Though we did not study the eﬀect of an arbitrary

phase lag we can predict the eﬀect of an out-of-phase lag. This would correspond to take a

negative value of (cid:101)Γ. Solving numerically the equations (14) and (15) for the stationary ﬂow

and m = 1, we ﬁnd that dynamo action is possible only if kΓ < 0. For the ﬂuctuating ﬂow

with zero mean, m = 1 and (cid:101)µ = 0 necessarily implies that k(cid:101)Γ = −1. Let us now consider a

ﬂow containing both a stationary and a ﬂuctuating part. Setting (cid:101)Γ < 0 necessarily implies

that k > 0. Then for Γ > 0, the stationary ﬂow is not a dynamo. Therefore in that case we

expect the dynamo threshold to decrease for increasing ρ. For Γ < 0, together with (cid:101)Γ < 0

and k > 0, it is equivalent to take (cid:101)Γ > 0 and Γ > 0 for k < 0 and it is then covered by our

subsequent results.

B. Case (ii): Smooth ﬂow

For the case (ii) we can directly apply the resonant condition made up for a stationary

ﬂow [17, 18], to the case of a ﬂuctuating ﬂow. For given m and k, the magnetic ﬁeld is

generated in a resonant layer r = r0 where the magnetic ﬁeld lines are aligned with the

shear and thus minimize the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀusion. This surface is determined by the

following relation [17, 18]

mΩ(cid:48)(r0) + kV (cid:48)(r0) = 0.

(16)

9

(17)

The resonant condition is satisﬁed if the resonant surface is embedded within the ﬂuid

0 < r0 < 1.

As Ω and V depend on time, this condition may only be satisﬁed at discrete times. This

implies successive periods of growth and damping, the dynamo threshold corresponding

to a zero mean growth rate. We can also deﬁne two distinct resonant surfaces r0 and (cid:101)r0

corresponding to the mean and ﬂuctuating part of the ﬂow,

(cid:48)
mΩ

(r0) + kV

(r0) = 0,

(cid:48)

m(cid:101)Ω(cid:48)((cid:101)r0(t), t) + k (cid:101)V (cid:48)((cid:101)r0(t), t) = 0

(18)

with appropriate deﬁnition of Ω, V , (cid:101)Ω and (cid:101)V . In addition, if (cid:101)Ω and (cid:101)V have the same time

dependency, as in (2), then (cid:101)r0 becomes time independent. Then we can predict two diﬀerent

behaviours of the dynamo threshold versus the ﬂuctuation rate ρ = (cid:101)Rm/Rm. If 0 < r0 < 1

and (cid:101)r0 > 1 then the dynamo threshold will increase with ρ. In this case the ﬂuctuation is

harmful to dynamo action. In the other hand if 0 < (cid:101)r0 < 1 then the dynamo threshold will

decrease with ρ.

From the deﬁnitions (18) and for a ﬂow deﬁned by (1), (2) and (4) we have

r0 = −(m/k)/(2Γ)

and

(cid:101)r0 = −(m/k)/(2(cid:101)Γ).

(19)

For m = 1 and k < 0, taking (cid:101)Γ < 0 implies (cid:101)r0 < 0 and then the impossibility of dynamo

action for the ﬂuctuating part of the ﬂow. Therefore, we expect that the addition of a

ﬂuctuating ﬂow with an out-of-phase lag between its vertical and azimuthal components

will necessarily be harmful to dynamo action. This will be conﬁrmed numerically in section

III C.

To solve (8), (10) and (11), we used a Galerkin approximation method in which the

trial and weighting functions are chosen in such a way that the resolution of the induction

equation is reduced to the conducting domain r ≤ 1 [5]. The method of resolution is given

in Appendix VI D. For the time resolution we used a Runge-Kutta scheme of order 4.

III. RESULTS

A. Stationary ﬂow ( (cid:101)Rm = 0)

We solve

(cid:60)γ(m = 1, k, Γ, 0, Rm, 0, 0) = 0

(20)

with k = (µ − 1)/Γ for case (i) and k = −1/(2r0Γ) for case (ii). In ﬁgure 1 the threshold Rm

and the ﬁeld frequency (cid:61)(γ) are plotted versus µ (resp. r0) for case (i) (resp. (ii)), and for

diﬀerent values of Γ. Though we do not know how these curves asymptote, and though the

range of µ (resp. r0) for which dynamo action occurs changes with Γ, it is likely that the

resonant condition |µ| < 1 (resp. 0 < r0 < 1) is fulﬁlled for the range of Γ corresponding

to a dynamo experiment (Γ ≈ 1). In case (i) the dispersion relation (32) in Appendix VI A

becomes F0 = 0.

We solve

(cid:60)γ(m = 1, k, 0, (cid:101)Γ, 0, (cid:101)Rm, ωf ) = 0.

(21)

In ﬁgure 2 the threshold (cid:101)Rm is plotted versus ωf for both cases (i) and (ii). In both cases we

take (cid:101)µ = 0 corresponding to k = −1/(cid:101)Γ. For the case (ii) it implies from (19) that (cid:101)r0 = 1/2,

meaning that the resonant surface is embedded in the ﬂuid and then favourable to dynamo

action. In each case (i) (cid:101)Γ = 1; 1.78 and (ii) (cid:101)Γ = 1; 2, we observe two regimes, one at low

To understand the existence of these two regimes, we pay attention to the time evolution of

the magnetic ﬁeld for diﬀerent frequencies ωf . In ﬁgure 3, the time evolution of b− (real and

1. Low frequency regime

For low frequencies (ωf = 1), we observe two time scales : periodic phases of growth

and decrease of the ﬁeld, with a time scale equal to the period of the ﬂow as expected by

Floquet’s theory. In addition the ﬁeld has an eigen-frequency much higher than ωf . In fact

the slow phases of growth and decrease seem to occur every half period of the ﬂow. This

can be understood from the following remarks.

First of all the growth (or decrease) of the ﬁeld does not depend on the sign of the ﬂow.

Indeed, from (8), we show that if b±(m, k) is a solution for (Ω, V ), then its complex conjugate

b±∗(m, k) is a solution for (−Ω, −V ). Therefore we have b±(t + T /2) = b±∗(t) where

2π/ωf .

-2002001-1001001-50501-505012-4040123414

T = 2π/ωf is the period of the ﬂow. Now from Floquet’s theory (see Appendix VI A),

we may write b(r, t) in the form b(r, τ ) exp(γt), with b(r, τ ) 2π-periodic in τ = ωf t. This

implies that changing (Ω, V ) in (−Ω, −V ) changes the sign of (cid:61)(γ). This is consistent with

the fact that for given m and k, the direction of propagation of B changes with the direction

of the ﬂow. Therefore changing the sign of the ﬂow changes the sign of propagation of the

ﬁeld but does not change the magnetic energy, neither the dynamo threshold (cid:101)Rm which are

then identical from one half-period of the ﬂow to another. This means that the dynamo

threshold does not change if we consider f (t) = | cos(ωf t)| instead of cos(ωf t). It is then

suﬃcient to concentrate on one half-period of the ﬂow like for example [ π
2ωf

, 3π
2ωf

] (modulo

The second remark uses the fact that the ﬂow geometry that we consider does not change in

time (only the ﬂow magnitude changes). For such a geometry we can calculate the dynamo

threshold Rm corresponding to the stationary case. Then coming back to the ﬂuctuating

ﬂow, we understand that (cid:101)Rm|f (t)| > Rm (resp. (cid:101)Rm|f (t)| < Rm) corresponds to a growing

(resp. decreasing) phase of the ﬁeld. Assuming that the dynamo threshold (cid:101)Rm is given by

the time average < . > of the ﬂow magnitude leads to the following estimation for (cid:101)Rm

(cid:101)Rm ≈

as < | cos(ωf t)| >= 2/π. For the three cases (a), (b) and (c) in ﬁgure 2 we give in table

III B 1 the ratio 2 (cid:101)Rm/πRm which is found to be always close to unity. In this interpretation

of the results the frequency ωf does not appear, provided that it is suﬃciently weak in order

that the successive phases of growth and decrease have suﬃcient time to occur. This can

explain why for low frequencies in ﬁgure 2 the dynamo threshold (cid:101)Rm does not depend on

π).

Finally the frequencies ω of the stationary case for Γ = (cid:101)Γ are also reported in table III B 1.

For a geometry identical to case (c), we ﬁnd, in the stationary case, ω = 33 which indeed

corresponds to the eigen-frequency of the ﬁeld occurring in ﬁgure 3 for ωf = 1. The previous

remarks assume that the ﬂow frequency is suﬃciently small compared to the eigen-frequency

of the ﬁeld, in order to have successive phases of growth and decrease of the ﬁeld. We can

check that the values of ω given in table III B 1 are indeed reasonable estimations of the

transition frequencies between the low and high frequency regimes in ﬁgure 2.

2. High frequency regime

In case (ii) and for high frequencies (ﬁgure 3, ωf = 100), the signal is made of harmonics

without growing nor decreasing phases. We note that the eigen-frequency of the real and

imaginary parts of b− are diﬀerent, the one being twice the other.

In case (i), relying on the resolution of equations (14) and (15) given in Appendix VI A, we

can show that (cid:101)Rm ∝ ω3/4

f

. We also ﬁnd that some double frequency as found in ﬁgure 3 for

the case (ii) can emerge from an approximate 3 × 3 matrix system. As these developments

necessitate the notations introduced in Appendix VI A, they are postponed in Appendix

VI B.

3. Further comments about the ability for ﬂuctuating ﬂows to sustain dynamo action

We found and explained how a ﬂuctuating ﬂow (zero mean) can act as a dynamo. We

also understood why the dynamo threshold for a ﬂuctuating ﬂow is higher than that for

a stationary ﬂow with the same geometry. It is because the time-average of the velocity

norm of the ﬂuctuating ﬂow is on the mean lower than that of the stationary ﬂow. This can

be compensated with other deﬁnitions of the magnetic Reynolds number. Our deﬁnition is

based on maxt |Ω(r, t)|. An other deﬁnition based on < |Ω(r, t)| >t would exactly compensate

the diﬀerence.

Recently a controversy appeared about the diﬃculty for a ﬂuctuating ﬂow (zero mean) to

sustain dynamo action at low Pm [26], whereas a mean ﬂow (non-zero time average) exhibits

a ﬁnite threshold at low Pm [10, 27] (the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm, being deﬁned as

the ratio of the viscosity to the diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid). This issue is important not only

for dynamo experiments but also for natural objects like the Earth’s inner-core or the solar

convective zone in which the electro-conducting ﬂuid is characterized by a low Pm. Though

we did not study this problem, our results suggest that the dynamo threshold should not

be much diﬀerent between ﬂuctuating and mean ﬂows, provided an appropriate deﬁnition

of the magnetic Reynolds number is taken. In that case why does it seem so diﬃcult to

sustain dynamo action at low Pm for a ﬂuctuating ﬂow [26] whereas it seems much easier

for a mean ﬂow [10, 27] ?

In the simulations with a mean ﬂow [10, 27], two dynamo regimes have been found,

the one with a threshold much lower than the other. In the lowest threshold regime, the

magnetic ﬁeld is generated at some inﬁnite scale in two directions [27]. There is then an

inﬁnite scale separation between the magnetic and the velocity ﬁeld, and the dynamo action

17

is probably of mean-ﬁeld type and might be understood in terms of α-eﬀect, β-eﬀect, etc.

In that case, removing the periodic boundary conditions would cancel the scale separation

and imply the loss of the dynamo action. In the highest threshold regime, the magnetic

ﬁeld is generated at a scale similar to the ﬂow scale, the periodic boundary conditions are

forgotten and the dynamo action can not be understood in terms of an α-eﬀect anymore.

In order to compare the mean ﬂow results [27] with those for a ﬂuctuating ﬂow [26] we have

to consider only the highest threshold regime in [27], the lowest one relying on mean-ﬁeld

dynamo processes due to the periodic boundary conditions and which are absent in the

ﬂuctuating ﬂow calculations [26].

Now when comparing the threshold of the highest threshold regime for a mean ﬂow with

the threshold obtained for a ﬂuctuating ﬂow and with appropriate deﬁnitions of Rm, a strong

diﬀerence remains at low Pm [28]. A speculation made by Schekochihin et al. [29] is that

the highest threshold regime obtained for the mean ﬂow at low Pm [27] would correspond in

fact to the large Pm results for the ﬂuctuating ﬂow in [28]. Their arguments rely on the fact

that the mean ﬂow in [27] is peaked at large scale and so spatially smooth for the generated

magnetic ﬁeld. It would then belongs to the same class as the large-Pm ﬂuctuation dynamo.

Both dynamo thresholds are found to be similar indeed, and thus the discrepancy vanishes.

Though the helical ﬂow that we consider here is noticeably diﬀerent (no chaotic trajec-

tories) it may have some consistency with the simulations at large Pm mentioned above and

at least supports the speculation by Schekochihin et al. [29].

C. Periodic ﬂow with non zero mean

We are now interested in the case where both (cid:101)Rm (cid:54)= 0 and Rm (cid:54)= 0. The ﬂow is then the

sum of a non zero mean part and a ﬂuctuating part. We have considered two approaches

depending on which part of the ﬂow geometry is ﬁxed, either the mean or the ﬂuctuating

18

part.

solve the equation

1. Γ = 1

Here we ﬁx Γ = 1, m = 1 and k = −1 and vary (cid:101)Γ, ρ and ωf for the case (ii). Then we

(cid:60)γ(m = 1, k = −1, Γ = 1, (cid:101)Γ = 1/2(cid:101)r0, Rm, (cid:101)Rm = ρRm, ωf ) = 0

(23)

to plot Rm as a function of ρ in ﬁgure 4 for values of (cid:101)r0 and ωf . From (19) we have r0 = 1/2

which corresponds to a mean ﬂow geometry with a dynamo threshold about 100. The curves

are plotted for several values of (cid:101)Γ leading to values of (cid:101)r0 not necessarily between 0 and 1.

We consider two ﬂuctuation frequencies ωf = 1 and ωf = 50. We ﬁnd that the dynamo

threshold Rm increases asymptotically with ρ unless the resonant condition 0 < (cid:101)r0 < 1 is

satisﬁed, here the curves (a), (b) and (e). For these three curves we checked that in the

limit of large ρ, Rm = O(ρ−1). For (cid:101)r0 = 1/4 (curve (e)) and for ρ ≈ 1 we do not know if a

dynamo threshold exists.

2. (cid:101)Γ = 1

Here we ﬁx (cid:101)Γ = 1, m = 1 and k = −1 and vary Γ, ρ and ωf . We then solve the equation

(cid:60)γ(m = 1, k = −1, Γ, (cid:101)Γ, Rm, (cid:101)Rm = ρRm, ωf ) = 0

(24)

with Γ = 1 − µ in case (i) and Γ = 1/2r0 in case (ii). In ﬁgure 5, Rm is plotted versus ρ

for values of µ (resp. r0) in case (i) (resp. (ii)) and ωf . Taking (cid:101)Γ = 1, m = 1 and k = −1

implies (cid:101)µ = 0 in case (i) and (cid:101)r0 = 0.5 in case (ii). In both cases (i) and (ii) the ﬂuctuating

part of the ﬂow satisﬁes the resonant condition for which dynamo action is possible. This

implies that Rm should scale as O(ρ−1) provided that ρ is suﬃciently large. In each case

we consider two ﬂow frequencies, ωf = 1 and ωf = 10 for case (i), ωf = 1 and ωf = 50

for case (ii). The curves are plotted for diﬀerent values of Γ corresponding to |µ| < 1 for

case (i) and 0 < r0 < 1 for case (ii). For large ρ we checked that Rm = O(ρ−1). The main

diﬀerences between the curves is that Rm versus ρ may decrease monotonically or not. In

particular in case (i) for µ = 0.4, Rm decreases by 40% when ρ goes from 0 to 1 showing

that even a small ﬂuctuation can strongly decrease the dynamo threshold. In most of the

curves there is a bump for ρ around unity showing a strong increase of the threshold before

the ﬁnal decrease at larger ρ.

to plot Rm versus ρ in ﬁgure 6 for various frequencies ωf . Taking Γ = (cid:101)Γ = 1, m = 1 and

k = −1 implies r0 = (cid:101)r0 = 0.5 For ρ larger than 1, Rm decreases as O(ρ−1) as mentioned

earlier. For ρ smaller than unity, Rm decreases versus ρ monotonically only if ωf is large

enough. In fact the transition value of ωf above which Rm decreases monotonically is exactly

the ﬁeld frequency ω (here ω = 33) corresponding to ρ = 0 . This shows that a ﬂuctuation

of small intensity (ρ ≤ 1) helps the dynamo action only if its frequency is suﬃciently high.

This is shown in Appendix VI C for the case (i). Though, the frequency above which a small

ﬂuctuation intensity helps the dynamo may be much larger than ω. For example in case

(i) for µ = 0.4 and (cid:101)µ = 0 represented in ﬁgure 5, we have ω = 0.51. For ωf = 1 small

ﬂuctuation helps, for ωf = 10 they do not help, and for higher frequencies they help again.

22

In this paper we studied the modiﬁcation of the dynamo threshold of a stationary helical

ﬂow by the addition of a large scale helical ﬂuctuation. We extended a previous asymptotic

study [25] to the case of a ﬂuctuation of arbitrary intensity (controlled by the parameter

ρ). We knew from previous studies [17, 18] that the dynamo eﬃciency of a helical ﬂow is

characterized by some resonant condition at large Rm. First we veriﬁed numerically that

such resonant condition holds at lower Rm corresponding to the dynamo threshold, for both

a stationary and a ﬂuctuating (no mean) helical ﬂow. Then for a helical ﬂow made of a mean

part plus a ﬂuctuating part we showed that, in the asymptotic cases ρ (cid:28) 1 (dominating

mean) and ρ (cid:29) 1 (dominating ﬂuctuation), it is naturally the resonant condition of the

mean (for the ﬁrst case) or the ﬂuctuating (for the second case) part of the ﬂow which

governs the dynamo eﬃciency and then the dynamo threshold. In between, for ρ of order

unity and if the resonant condition of each ﬂow part (mean and ﬂuctuating) is satisﬁed, the

threshold ﬁrst increases with ρ before reaching an asymptotic behaviour in O(ρ−1). However

there is no systematic behaviour as depicted in ﬁgure 5 (i) for ωf = 1 and µ = 0.4, in which

a threshold decrease of 40% is obtained between ρ = 0 and ρ = 1. If the ﬂuctuation part

of the ﬂow does not satisfy the resonant condition, then the dynamo threshold increases

drastically with ρ.

Contrary to the case of a cellular ﬂow [11], there is no systematic eﬀect of the phase lag

between the diﬀerent components of the helical ﬂow. For the helical ﬂow geometry it may

imply an increase or a decrease of the dynamo threshold, depending how it changes the

resonant condition mentioned above.

There is some similarity between our results and those obtained for a noisy (instead of

23

periodic) ﬂuctuation [8].

In particular in [8] it was found that increasing the noise level

the threshold ﬁrst increases due to geometrical eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld lines and then

decreases at larger noise. This could explain why at ρ ≈ 1 we generally obtain a maximum

of the dynamo threshold.

Finally these results show that the optimization of a dynamo experiment depends not only

on the mean part of the ﬂow but also on its non stationary large scale part. If the ﬂuctuation

is not optimized then the threshold may increase drastically with (even small) ρ, ruling out

any hope of producing dynamo action.

In addition, even if the ﬂuctuation is optimized

(resonant condition satisﬁed by the ﬂuctuation), our results suggest that there is generally

some increase of the dynamo threshold with ρ when ρ ≤ 1. If the geometry of the ﬂuctuation

is identical to that of the mean part of the ﬂow, there can be some slight decrease of the

threshold at high frequencies but this decrease is rather small. When ρ > 1 the dynamo

threshold decreases as O(ρ−1) which at ﬁrst sight seems interesting. However we have to

keep in mind that as soon as ρ > 1 the driving power spent to maintain the ﬂuctuation

is larger than that to maintain the mean ﬂow. Then the relevant dynamo threshold is not

Rm any more, but (cid:101)Rm = ρRm instead. In addition monitoring large scale ﬂuctuations in an

experiment may not always be possible, especially if they occur from ﬂow destabilisation.

In that case it is better to try cancelling them as was done in the VKS experiment in which

an azimuthal belt has been added [30].

VI. APPENDIX

A. Resolution of equations (14) and (15) for the case (i): solid body ﬂow

As f (t) is time-periodic of period 2π/ωf , we look for b(r, t) in the form b(r, τ ) exp(γt)

with b(r, τ ) being 2π-periodic in τ = ωf t. Thus we look for the functions b±(r, τ ) in the

form

with

B. High frequency regime for the periodic ﬂow (i) with zero mean

Following the notation of section VI A, and considering a periodic ﬂow (i) with zero mean,

we have µ = 0. From (30) this implies that qn = sn. Using the identity

In addition, from the approximate 3 × 3 matrix system, the double-frequency 2ωf emerges

C. High frequency regime and small modulation amplitude for the periodic ﬂow (i)

with non zero mean

For small amplitude modulation ρ << 1 the system (31) is truncated so as to keep the

ﬁrst Fourier modes n = 0 and n = ±1. The dispersion relation :

F0(Rm, ω) to ﬁrst order in δR and δω given that F0(R0, ω0) = 0 and with the constants

recovering results similar to those obtained in [25] using a diﬀerent approach.

We have in mind that for some values of ωf resonance can occur. An oscillating system

forced at a resonant frequency is prone to instability and a large negative threshold shift

is expected. However, inspection of (46) reveals no clear relation between the sign of R2

and the forcing frequency which appears in the quantities X and Y . We only know that

f1g2 − f2g1 < 0, since near the critical point (δR = Rm − R0) the denominator in (46) is

proportional to the growth rate of the dynamo driven by a steady ﬂow. When ρ = 0, we

shall consider Eq. (41) for an imposed δR and complex values of δω = ω1 + iσ1 where ω1 is

the frequency shift and (cid:60)(γ) = −σ1 is the growth rate, given by

σ1 = δR

f1g2 − f2g1

2

(47)

Above the dynamo threshold, (δR > 0) the ﬁeld is ampliﬁed ((cid:60)(γ) > 0) thus σ1 < 0 and

f1g2 − f2g1 < 0.

In the high frequency limit (ωf >> ω0) expressions for X and Y can be derived explicitly

using the asymptotic behaviour of the Bessel functions for large arguments. For µ = 0 with

28

q±1 = s±1 ≈ (ωf ±ω0)1/2(1±i)/

one gets

When µ = 0, we have also f1 = 1/2 and f2 = 0, leading to the expression for R2 :

For the wave numbers m = −k = 1, numerical calculations of g1 and g2 which only depend

on the critical parameters R0 and ω0 give g1/g2 = 1.626, and thus R2 < 0 when ωf → ∞.

When µ = 0, there are several reasons to consider the particular value of the forcing : ωf =

2ω0. One of them is that for Hill or Mathieu equations it is a resonant frequency. Moreover, in

the present problem it leads to simpliﬁed calculations. In particular the asymptotic behavior

of βn/Fn can still be used for n = +1 since ωf + ω0 is large, while the approximation is no

longer valid for n = −1. Nevertheless, the mode n = −1 is remarkable since it corresponds

to s−1 = s∗

0 from which it follows that β−1 = β∗

0 and F−1 = −iR0β∗

0. Finally one gets the

exact result : β−1/F−1 = i/R0, which leads to

For the values R0 = 20.82 and ω0 = 4.35 corresponding to Fig. 8 (f) one gets X = −1.5×10−2

and Y = 3.3 × 10−2. The threshold shift is

R2 ≈

(51)

showing that the sign of R2 changes when ωf decreases from inﬁnity to 2ω0. This result

is in qualitative agreement with the exact results reported in Fig. 8 (f) where R2 = 0 for

ωf = 8.3 (cid:39) 2ω0. When the forcing frequency is exactly twice the eigen-frequency ω0 we

had rather expected a large negative value of R2 on the basis it is a resonant condition

for ordinary diﬀerential system under temporal modulation. In Fig. 8 (f) the maximum

negative value of R2 occurs for ωf (cid:39) 4ω0 which cannot be explained by simple arguments.

For µ (cid:54)= 0, we have not been able to ﬁnd resonant conditions like : nωf + mω0 = 0

(n, m integers) between ωf and ω0 such that ωf would be associated to a special behavior

of the threshold shift. Contrary to the Hill equation, the induction equation is a partial

diﬀerential equation with the consequence that the spatial and temporal properties of the

dynamo are not independant. The wave numbers k and m are linked to the frequencies ω0

and ωf through q±n and s±n which appears as arguments of Bessel functions having rules of

composition less trivial than trigonometric functions. Exhibiting resonant conditions implies

to ﬁnd relationship between q±n, s±n and q0, s0 for speciﬁc values of ωf . We have shown

above for µ = 0 that a relation of complex conjugaison exists for n = −1 when ωf = 2ω0

but we have not yet found how to generalize to other values of µ and have left this part for

a future work.

we replace the expression of b± given by (53) into the induction equation (8), in order to

E. Corrigendum of Normand (2003) results [25]

For very small values of the ﬂuctuation rate ρ and for an inﬁnite shear (case (i)), a

comparison can be made between the results obtained for (cid:101)µ = 0 by the method based on

Floquet theory (see Appendix VI A) and those obtained by a perturbative approach [25]

which consists in expanding Rm and the frequency (cid:61)(p) in powers of ρ according to

(cid:61)(p) = ω0 + ρω1 + ρ2ω2 + ....

Rm = R0 + ρR1 + ρ2R2 + ....

(62)

(63)

where R0 and ω0 are respectively the critical values of the Reynolds number and the fre-

quency in the case of a stationary ﬂow. At the leading order it appears that : ω1 = R1 = 0.

At the next order, the expressions of R2 and ω2 are given in [25], however their numerical

values are not correct due to an error in their computation.

After correction, the new values of R2 and ω2 are given in Figure 7 for the set of parameters

considered in [25]: m = 1, k = −0.56 and Γ = 1 (µ = 0.44). The diﬀerent curves correspond

to values of (cid:101)Γ which are not necessarily the same than those taken in [25]. For |(cid:101)µ| suﬃciently

small (curves e and f), R2 changes its sign twice versus the forcing frequency. We ﬁnd that

R2 is negative for low and high frequencies implying a dynamo threshold smaller than the

one for the stationary ﬂow. At intermediate frequencies R2 is positive with a maximum

value, implying a dynamo threshold larger than the one for the stationary ﬂow. For larger

values of |(cid:101)µ| (curves a, b, c and d) R2 is positive for all forcing frequencies with a maximum

value at a low frequency which increases with |(cid:101)µ|. This implies that for |(cid:101)µ| suﬃciently large

the dynamo threshold is larger than the one obtained for the stationary ﬂow as was already

mentioned in section III A. For (cid:101)Γ = 1.78 we have (cid:101)µ = 0. In this case, we have checked that

the values of R2 and ω2 are in good agreement with the values of Rm and ω obtained by the

method of Appendix VI A, provided ρ ≤ 0.1.

For completeness we have also calculated the values of R2 and ω2 for m = 1, k = −1 and

Γ = 1, (µ = 0) as considered in the body of the paper. The results are plotted in Figure

8. Qualitatively the results are in good agreement with those of Figure 7. For (cid:101)µ = 0 again,

we have checked that the values of R2 and ω2 are in good agreement with the values of Rm

and ω obtained by the method of Appendix VI A, provided ρ ≤ 0.1. For higher values of

the modulation amplitude ρ the relative diﬀerence between the results obtained by the two

methods can reach 10% on R2 for ρ = 0.4.

Finally it must be noticed that our parameters (cid:101)Γ and ωf are strictly equivalent to respec-

tively ε1 and σ in [25].

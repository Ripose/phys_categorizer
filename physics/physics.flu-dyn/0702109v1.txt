Inverse cascades and α-eﬀect at low magnetic Prandtl number

P.D. Mininni

(Dated: August 13, 2013)

Dynamo action in a fully helical Beltrami (ABC) ﬂow is studied using both direct numerical
simulations and subgrid modeling. Suﬃcient scale separation is given in order to allow for large-
scale magnetic energy build-up. Growth of magnetic energy obtains down to a magnetic Prandtl
number PM = RM /RV close to 0.005, where RV and RM are the kinetic and magnetic Reynolds
numbers. The critical magnetic Reynolds number for dynamo action Rc
M seems to saturate at values
close to 20. Detailed studies of the dependence of the amplitude of the saturated magnetic energy
with PM are presented. In order to decrease PM , numerical experiments are conducted with either
RV or RM kept constant. In the former case, the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy saturates to
a value slightly below unity as PM decreases. Examination of energy spectra and structures in real
space both reveal that quenching of the velocity by the large-scale magnetic ﬁeld takes place, with
an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity and a force-free ﬁeld at large scale in the saturated regime.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years the increase in computing power, as well
as the development of subgrid models for magnetohydro-
dynamic (MHD) turbulence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has allowed the
study of a numerically almost unexplored territory: the
regime of low magnetic Prandtl number (PM = RM /RV ,
where RV and RM are respectively the kinetic and mag-
netic Reynolds numbers). This MHD regime is of partic-
ular importance since several astrophysical [6] and geo-
physical [7, 8] problems are characterized by PM < 1, as
for example in the liquid core of planets such as Earth,
or in the convection zone of solar-type stars. Also, liquid
metals (e.g., mercury, sodium, or gallium) used in the
laboratory in attempting to generate dynamo magnetic
ﬁelds are in this regime [9, 10, 11, 12].

In recent publications [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], driven turbu-
lent MHD dynamos were studied numerically, within the
framework of rectangular periodic boundary conditions.
As PM is lowered at ﬁxed viscosity the magnetoﬂuid be-
comes more resistive than it is viscous, and it was found
that magnetic ﬁelds were harder to excite by the dynamo
process because of the increased turbulence in the ﬂuid.
The principal result was in obtaining the dependence
of the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rc
M with the
magnetic Prandtl number. These studies were done for
several settings, ranging from coherent helical [17] and
non-helical [14, 16] forcing, as well as for random forc-
ing [13, 15]. While for coherent forcing an asymptotic
regime was found at small values of PM , the behavior of
Rc
M for random forcing is still unclear (see also [18, 19]
for theoretical arguments based on the Kazantsev model
[20]).

For coherent forcing such as the Taylor-Green vortex
(that corresponds to several laboratory experiments us-
ing two counter-rotating disks), the value of Rc
M was ob-
served to increase by a factor larger than six before the
asymptotic regime for small values of PM was reached
[14]. Although the precise value of Rc
M in experiments is

expected to be modiﬁed by the presence of boundaries,
it is of interest to study what properties of the forcing
can modify and decrease its value. It is well known from
theory [21], two-point closure models [22], and direct nu-
merical simulations (DNS) at PM = 1 [23, 24, 25] that
the presence of net helicity in the ﬂow helps the dynamo
and decreases the value of Rc

M .
In [17] dynamos with a helical forcing function were
studied using the Roberts ﬂow, but mechanical energy
= √2, which left little
was injected at a wavenumber
room in the spectrum for any back-transfer of magnetic
helicity as expected in the helical case [22, 26, 27]; indeed,
k
= 1 is the only possibility since the computations are

done in a box of length 2π corresponding to a k = 1
gravest mode. In this work, in contrast, we study the ef-
fect of a fully helical Arn’old-Childress-Beltrami (ABC)
forcing [28] with energy injected at a slightly smaller scale
(note that the ABC forcing is related to the Roberts forc-
ing, since it can be deﬁned as a superposition of three
Roberts ﬂows). As a result of the intermediate scale forc-
ing, some α-eﬀect or inverse cascade of magnetic helicity
can a priori develop and a magnetic ﬁeld at large scales
can grow.

ABC ﬂows and helical dynamos were explored in many
diﬀerent contexts in the literature (see e.g.
[29] for a
study close to PM = 1, and [30, 31] for studies in the
context of fast dynamo action). The main aim of the
present work is to study the impact of helical ﬂows at
intermediate scales in the development of magnetic ﬁelds
through dynamo action at PM < 1. In this context, it is
worth noting that some simulations of ABC dynamos in
the low magnetic Prandtl number regime were discussed
in Refs.
[25, 32], although no systematic exploration of
the space of parameters was attempted. Also, Ref. [33]
presented some preliminary results for the kinematic dy-

of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst attempt to systemati-
cally study the saturation values of the ﬁelds for helical
ﬂows at PM < 1 in numerical simulations.

The external forcing function f in Eq. (1) injects both
kinetic energy and kinetic helicity. For f we use the ABC

with A = 0.9, B = 1, C = 1.1 [32], and kF = 3. The
ABC ﬂow is an eigenfunction of the curl with eigenvalue
kF , and as a result if used as an initial condition it is
an exact solution of the Euler equations. In the hydro-
dynamic simulations, for large enough ν (small RV ) the
laminar solution is stable. As ν is decreased the lami-
nar ﬂow becomes unstable and develops turbulence (see
[35] for a study of the early bifurcations at intermediate
Reynolds numbers).

To properly resolve the turbulent ﬂow, the maximum
wavenumber in the code kmax = N/3 (N is the lin-
ear resolution and the standard 2/3-rule for dealiasing
is used) has to be smaller than the mechanic dissipation
wavenumber kν = (ǫ/ν3)1/4 (ǫ
U 3/L is the energy
injection rate). As a result, as ν decreases and RV in-
creases, the linear resolution N has to be increased. At
some point the use of DNS to solve Eqs.
(1) and (2)
turns to be too expensive from the computational point
of view and some kind of model for unresolved scales is
needed.

In the next section, we describe the computations and
the results for both the kinematic dynamo regime [where
j
B is negligible in Eq. (1)], and for full MHD (where
the Lorentz force modiﬁes the ﬂow). The ﬁrst step is to
establish what are the thresholds in RM at which dynamo
behavior sets in as RV is raised and PM is decreased
(Section III A). The procedure to do this is the following
(see e.g., Ref.
[14]). First a hydrodynamic simulation
at a given value of RV is done. Then, a small and ran-
dom (non-helical) magnetic ﬁeld is introduced, and sev-
eral simulations are done changing only the value of RM .
At a given RM , the magnetic energy can either decay
or grow exponentially.
In each simulation, the growth
rate σ is then deﬁned as σ = d ln(EM )/dt. The critical
magnetic Reynolds number Rc
M for the onset of dynamo
action corresponds to σ = 0, and in practice is obtained
from a linear interpolation between the two points with
respectively positive and negative σ closest to zero. The
growth rate σ is typically expressed in units of the recip-
rocal of the large-scale eddy turnover time T = L/U .

scale available in the box. In this regime, we will study
the maximum value attained by the magnetic energy as
a function of PM (Section III C), as well as the amount
of magnetic energy at scales larger than the forcing scale
(Section III D). Finally, Section 4 is the conclusion.

III. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS

In order to obtain a systematic study of dynamo action

for ABC forcing and PM ≤
tions was conducted. Table I shows the parameters used

in the simulations. Note that when a range is invoked in
the values of RM , it indicates several runs were done with
the same value of RV but changing the value of RM to
span the range (typically three to ﬁve runs). The set of
runs 6 and 6a have the same parameters (ν, η, and r.m.s
velocity), but while set 6 comprises DNS at resolutions
of 2563 grid points, in set 6a the spatial resolution is 643
and the LAMHD equations were used in order to further
the testing of the model. Similar considerations apply to
run 9 and set 9b.

A. Threshold for dynamo action

Figure 1 summarizes the results of the study of the de-
pendence of the threshold Rc
M as PM is decreased. For
values of RM above the curve, dynamo action takes place
and initially small magnetic ﬁelds are ampliﬁed. Below
the curve, Ohmic dissipation is too large to sustain a
dynamo. Noteworthy is the qualitative similarity of the
curve between the ABC ﬂow and previous results using
diﬀerent mechanical forcings [14, 16, 17]. Namely, an
increase in Rc
M is observed as turbulence develops, and
then an asymptotic regime is found in which the value
of Rc
M is independent of PM . Note that LAMHD simu-
lations were used to extend the study for values of PM
smaller than what can be studied using DNS. Simula-
tions at the same value of PM were carried with the two
methods to validate the results from the subgrid model
(sets 6 and 6a). This procedure was used before in Ref.
[14]. As in the previous study, the LAMHD equations
slightly overestimate the value of Rc

M .

Besides the similarities in the shape of the curves for
diﬀerent forcing functions, two quantitative diﬀerences
are striking: (i) only a mild rise in Rc
M is observed here
as PM is decreased (a factor 2, while a factor larger than
6 obtains for the Taylor-Green vortex [14]); and (ii) the

FIG. 5: Time history of (minus) the magnetic helicity for runs
in set 5 (constant RV ≈ 450). The magnetic Reynolds number
in each run is RM ≈ 22 (dashed line), RM ≈ 45 (dash-dotted
line), RM ≈ 180 (dotted line), and RM ≈ 450 (solid line).

asymptotic value of Rc
M for small values of PM is ten
times smaller than for other ﬂows studied [14, 17]. A
similar result was obtained using mean ﬁeld theory and
shell models in Ref.
[34], and the quantitative diﬀer-
ences observed were associated with the relative ease to
excite large-scale helical dynamos compared with non-
helical and small-scale dynamos.

Note that the curve in Fig. 1 was constructed using the
sets 1 to 7 and 9b of Table 1. Several runs at constant RV
but varying RM are required to deﬁne Rc

σ closest to 0± provides a single point on the curves in
Fig. 1. Note that Figure 2 also gives bounds for the
uncertainties in the determination of the threshold Rc
M
(see e.g. Ref. [14]): errors in Fig. 1 can be deﬁned as the
distance between the value of Rc
M and the value of RM in
the simulation with σ closest to 0. Note also the asymp-
totic approach to a growth rate of order unity for large
values of the magnetic Reynolds number, as for example
in the runs in set 5.

B. Time evolution

A comparison of the time evolution of the magnetic
energy in two dynamo runs with the same mechanic and
10−2)
magnetic Prandtl number (RM ≈
is shown in Fig. 3. One of the runs is a DNS from set
6, while the other is a LAMHD simulation from set 6a.
Two diﬀerent stages can be identiﬁed at ﬁrst sight in
these runs. The kinematic regime at early times, with an
exponential ampliﬁcation of the magnetic energy (used
to deﬁne the growth rates and thresholds in Figs. 1 and
2), and the nonlinear saturated regime at late times. As
expected from the results discussed in the previous sub-
section, the LAMHD equations at a coarser grid (643)
are able to capture the kinematic dynamo regime. While
in the DNS with a resolution of 2563 the growth rate is
0.20. But the
σ
LAMHD simulation also captures properly the nonlin-
ear saturation (albeit the saturated level is reached a bit
earlier) and the amplitudes of the magnetic energy in the
steady state are comparable (see insert in Fig. 3). Small
diﬀerences observed in the time evolution are likely due
to diﬀerences in the initial random magnetic seed.
In
the following, we shall use both DNS and LAMHD sim-
ulations to study the nonlinear saturated regime at low
PM .

In helical ﬂows, as magnetic energy saturates, a large
scale magnetic ﬁeld develops (i.e., at scales larger than
the forcing scale) due to the helical α-eﬀect [21, 22, 25,
26, 27, 39]. It is of interest to know what happens with
the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld as the value of PM
is decreased. An example is shown in Figure 4, which
gives the magnetic energy as a function of time for runs
in set 5. Only the value of RM (and therefore of PM )
450 in all runs and
is changed between the runs (RV ≈
PM varying from 1 to 0.03). For large values of RM
(but not necessarily for values of PM close to unity), the
growth rate σ is independent of RM and of order one as
noted in Section III A. Furthermore, as PM is decreased,
both σ and the saturation value of the magnetic energy
decrease. However, for the lowest value of PM , the mag-
netic Reynolds number is quite low and in that context
computations at a higher value of RV and with the same
sets of PM are of value to see what fraction of the present
result is a threshold eﬀect at low RM .

as a function of time for the same simulations than in Fig.
4. The external forcing injects positive kinetic helicity in
the ﬂow. In the kinematic regime, the α eﬀect is propor-
tional to minus the kinetic helicity [26, 27]. From mean
ﬁeld theory, the magnetic ﬁeld in the large scales should
grow with magnetic helicity of the same sign than the α
eﬀect (negative), as indeed observed (see Refs.
[25, 40]
for helical dynamo simulations at PM = 1). In the simu-
lations, magnetic helicity grows exponentially during the
kinematic regime. In runs with small RM , the saturated
state is reached shortly after the saturation of the expo-
nential phase. But as RM is increased, it is now clear
that an intermediate stage develops in which magnetic

energy and helicity keep growing slowly. As a result, sat-
uration takes place in longer times, and the time to reach
the ﬁnal steady state depends on the large scale magnetic
4π2/η). The dependence of the satu-
diﬀusion time (Tη ≈
ration time with RM can be observed in Fig. 5. It is also
worth mentioning that even in the runs with PM < 1,
the saturation of magnetic helicity can be well described
tsat)], where
by the formula HM (t)
−
k0 = 1 is the gravest mode, and tsat is the saturation
time of the small scale magnetic ﬁeld [25]. This indicates
that the slow saturation of the dynamo is dominated by
the evolution of the magnetic helicity in the largest scale
in the system.

From Figs. 4 and 5 it seems apparent that small values
of PM have a negative impact on the amplitude of the
magnetic ﬁeld generated by the dynamo. However, dif-
ferent results are obtained when the space of parameters
is explored keeping RM constant and increasing RV , as
another way to decrease PM . Figure 6 shows the results
in this case for the time evolution of the magnetic en-
ergy. As RV is increased from small values, a drop in the
growth rate σ and in the saturation value of the mag-
netic energy is observed. But then an asymptotic regime
is reached, in which both σ and the saturation value seem
to be roughly independent of RV and PM . As a result,
we conclude that the behavior observed in Figs. 4 and 5
is the result of critical slowing down: if the space of pa-
rameters is explored at constant RV , as PM is decreased
RM gets closer to Rc
M until no dynamo action is possible.
0.05
On the other hand, all the simulations with PM ≤
shown in Fig. 5 have RM /Rc
M approximately constant
(see Fig. 1) and critical slowing down is not observed.
However, we note that the value of RM for these runs is
still modest.

FIG. 9: (Color online) Kinetic energy spectrum at t = 0 [thick
(blue) lines], and magnetic energy spectrum (thin lines) at
diﬀerent times:
t = 11 (solid line), t = 29 (dashed line),
t = 47 (dash-dotted line), t = 95 (dash-triple dotted line),
t = 120 (long dashed line). The spectra are for a run in set 6
with RM ≈ 41. The last time is in the saturation regime (see
Fig. 6).

C. Saturation values

The amplitude of the magnetic energy (normalized by
the kinetic energy), after the nonlinear saturation takes
place, as a function of the magnetic Prandtl number is
shown in Fig. 7. This ﬁgure summarizes the results dis-
cussed in Figs. 4 and 6. As the value of PM is decreased,
if RV is kept constant and RM (and thus PM ) decreases,
the saturation of the dynamo takes place for lower values
of the magnetic energy. This is to be expected since as we
decrease PM we also decrease RM and at some point Rc
M
is reached. It is not clear whether such a strong depen-
dence would be observed if the constant RV runs were
performed at substantially higher values of RV as found
in astronomical bodies and in the laboratory; however,
such runs would be quite demanding from a numerical
standpoint unless one resorts to LES (Large Eddy Sim-
ulations) techniques, few of which have been developed
in MHD (see e.g., [1, 2, 3]). For values of RM smaller
than Rc
M , no dynamo action is expected and the ratio
EM /EV should indeed go to zero. On the other hand,
in the simulations with constant RV , the ratio EM /EV
seems to saturate for P . 0.25 and reach an approxi-
mately constant value close to
0.5. This indicates that
small scale turbulent ﬂuctuations in the velocity ﬁeld are
strongly quenched by the large scale magnetic ﬁeld, as
will be also shown later in the spectral evolution of the en-
ergies. The ratio EM /EV in helical large-scale dynamos
is also expected to be dependent on the scale separation
between the forcing wavenumber (here ﬁxed to kF = 3)

and the largest wavenumber in the system (here k = 1).
As the scale separation increases and there is more space
for an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity, we expect the
ratio EM /EV in the PM < 1 regime to also increase.

D. Spectral evolution

In Refs.

[16, 17] it was shown using diﬀerent forc-
ing functions that even at low PM the magnetic energy
spectrum in the kinematic regime of the dynamo peaks
at small scales. In these simulations, the critical mag-
netic Reynolds number Rc
M was of the order of a few
hundreds, and as a result small scales were excited. For
ABC forcing, Rc
M is of the order of a few tens and close
to the threshold small scales are damped fast. Only
large-scale dynamo action is observed and thus, even at
early times, the magnetic energy spectrum peaks at large
400, a
scales. However, if RM is increased above RM ≈
magnetic energy spectrum that peaks at scales smaller
than the forcing scale (as in Refs. [16, 17]) is recovered.
We focus here on large-scale dynamo action, and as a
result will discuss the spectral evolution in simulations

FIG. 11: (Color online) Kinetic [thick (blue) line] and mag-
netic energy spectra (thin line) at t = 150 in the simulation in
set 9 with RM ≈ 41 (PM = 0.0125) in the saturated regime.
The thick dashed line shows the total energy spectrum and
the thin vertical dotted line the wavenumber at which the α
ﬁltering sets in. Note the compatibility of the spectra with a

with RM of a few tens.

Figure 9 shows the evolution of the magnetic energy
spectrum at diﬀerent times for a run in set 6 with
41. As in previous studies, in the kinematic regime
RM ≈
all the Fourier shells grow with the same rate. Then,
magnetic saturation is reached and the mode at k = 1
keeps growing until it eventually saturates itself. Figure
10 shows the kinetic and magnetic energy spectra at late
times (t = 210) after nonlinear saturation in the simula-
41 (PM = 0.05). At k = 1 the
tion in set 6 with RM ≈
system is dominated by magnetic energy, but at smaller
scales the magnetic energy spectrum drops fast. The ki-
netic energy spectrum peaks at the forcing band (k = 3)
and then drops with a slope compatible with k−3. This
drop is due to the action of the Lorentz force that re-
moves mechanical energy from the k = 3 shell to sustain
the magnetic ﬁeld at k = 1 [41, 42].

A slope close to a k−3 power law in the kinetic energy
spectrum in the saturated regime at small scales is ob-
served in several of the simulations with PM < 1. Simu-
lations with small PM and larger values of RV were done
using both the LAMHD equations and high-resolution
DNS on grids of 5123 and 10243 points (see Table I). In
these simulations, a power law close to k−5/3 is observed
before the kinetic energy spectrum drops to a steeper
slope. As an example, Fig. 11 shows the kinetic and
magnetic energy spectra in a simulation from set 9 us-
ing the LAMHD model, with RM ≈
41 (PM = 0.0125).
Slopes corresponding to k−5/3, k−3, and k−5 are indi-
cated as a reference in Fig. 11. A k−5 power law in

run as in Figs. 9 and 10 (run with RM ≈
6). At all times, scales larger than the forcing scale have
negative magnetic helicity, while scales of the order of,
or smaller than the forcing scale have positive magnetic
helicity. This is consistent with an inverse cascade of neg-
ative magnetic helicity at wavenumbers smaller than kF ,
and with a direct transfer of positive magnetic helicity
at wavenumbers larger than kF , as analyzed in [45] using
transfer functions. The relative helicity in the k = 1 shell
grows with time until reaching saturation. Note that at
late times, HM (k = 1)/EM (k = 1)
1, indicating that
the large scale magnetic ﬁeld is nearly force-free.

≈ −

Figure 13 also shows the spectrum of HV (k)
−
k2HM (k), proportional to (minus) the non-linear α-eﬀect
[22]. Three times are shown for the same run than in
41). At early times
Figs. 9, 10, and 12 (set 6, RM ≈
k2HM (k)
(t = 11 and t = 29) the spectrum of HV (k)
is close to the spectrum of the kinetic helicity. However,
as the large scale magnetic ﬁeld grows (t = 120 is shown
in the ﬁgure) the current helicity k2HM (k) quenches ki-
netic helicity ﬂuctuations and the total spectrum drops
at scales smaller than kF .

−

As a result, at late times the magnetic energy is mostly
in the modes with wavenumber k = 1, which corresponds
to the largest available scale in the system. In addition,
the large scale magnetic ﬁeld is force-free (maximum rel-
ative helicity with HM (k) = EM (k) at k = 1. Figure 14
shows slices of the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds at early
and late times. The growth of a large scale magnetic
ﬁeld and the quenching of turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations
in the saturated regime can be easily identiﬁed.

The situation resembles other inverse cascade situa-
tions that have been studied numerically, in which the
fundamental k = 1 mode dominates the dynamics at long
times and its growth is only limited by its own dissipa-
tion rate [25, 39, 40, 46]. In helical dynamo simulations
at PM = 1 this behavior has also been observed, although
it was speculated that for PM < 1 the inverse cascade of
magnetic helicity and the generation of large scale ﬁelds
should be quenched [25]. In fact, the generation of mag-
netic energy at scales larger than the forcing scale is not
quenched as PM is decreased. This is illustrated in Fig.
15, which shows the ratio of the magnetic energy in the
k = 1 shell to the total kinetic energy in the saturated
state as a function of PM . Curves both at constant RV
and constant RM are given. For constant RM and small
PM the magnetic energy in the large scales seems to be
independent of PM and RV . The overall shape of the
curves is similar to the curves in Fig. 7, indicating that
at late times the evolution of the total magnetic energy
is dominated by the magnetic ﬁeld in the large scales.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown in this paper that the phenomenon
of inverse cascade of magnetic helicity, and the ensuing
growth of large-scale magnetic energy together with a

the magnetic energy spectrum (following a k−3 range)
was observed in experiments of dynamo action with con-
strained helical ﬂows at low RM [43]; in addition, a k−3
power law for the kinetic energy spectrum is consistent
with the observed magnetic energy spectrum [44]. Note
that these power laws are only discussed here in order
to be able to compare with the experimental data, but
higher Reynolds numbers and thus more resolution will
be needed in order to ascertain the spectral dependency
of the ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld in the diﬀerent inertial
ranges of low PM simulations.

licity k−1HM (k)/EM (k) at diﬀerent times for the same

lations up to the nonlinear saturation. The quenching
of the velocity in the small scales, already observed in
laboratory experiments, is also present. The augmenta-
tion of the critical magnetic Reynolds number as RV in-
creases is less than in the non-helical case [13, 14, 15], and
even smaller than what was found for helical ﬂows when
the large-scale dynamo is not permitted, as e.g. for the
Roberts ﬂow at k
1 [17]. The reason for this diﬀerence
is that in the present study we allowed for enough scale
separation between the forcing scale and the largest scale
for helical large-scale dynamo action to develop. The re-
sults are in agreement with studies using mean-ﬁeld the-
ory and shell models to study both large- and small-scale
dynamo action [34]. Large-scale helical dynamo action
in the PM < 1 regime requires much smaller magnetic
Reynolds numbers to work than small-scale dynamos.

≈

The challenge remains, numerically, to be able to reach
values of the magnetic Prandtl number comparable to
those found in geophysics and astrophysics and in the
10−5. However, it is unlikely that
laboratory, i.e. PM ≈
the dynamo instability found here down to PM = 0.005
would disappear as PM is lowered further. An open ques-
tion, of importance from the experimental point of view
when dealing with turbulent liquid metals, is whether the
critical magnetic Reynolds number Rc
M will stabilize, for

force-free magnetic ﬁeld at large times, is present at low
magnetic Prandtl number, down to PM = 0.005 in kine-
matic regime studies and down to PM = 0.01 in simu-

a given ﬂow, at a value intermediate between what it is at
PM = 1 and the peak of the curve (see Fig. 1), or whether
for large-scale helical dynamo action and extremely low
values of PM , it will go back down to the value it has at
PM = 1. The data up to this day suggests the former,
but on the other hand the study made in the context of
two-point closures of turbulence [44] suggests the latter.
This also means that reliable models of turbulent ﬂows
in MHD must be developed in order that we can explore
in a more systematic way the parameter space character-
istic of the ﬂows of interest, as for the geo-dynamo or the
solar dynamo.

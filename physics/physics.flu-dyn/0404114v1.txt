The dimensionless kinetic energy dissipation rate Cε is estimated from numerical simulations of
statistically stationary isotropic box turbulence that is slightly compressible. The Taylor microscale
Reynolds number (Reλ) range is 20 . Reλ . 220 and the statistical stationarity is achieved with
a random phase forcing method. The strong Reλ dependence of Cε abates when Reλ ≈ 100 after
which Cε slowly approaches ≈ 0.5, a value slightly diﬀerent to previously reported simulations but
in good agreement with experimental results. If Cε is estimated at a speciﬁc time step from the time
series of the quantities involved it is necessary to account for the time lag between energy injection
and energy dissipation. Also, the resulting value can diﬀer from the ensemble averaged value by up
to ±30%. This may explain the spread in results from previously published estimates of Cε.

INTRODUCTION

The notion that the mean turbulent kinetic energy dis-
sipation rate ε is ﬁnite and independent of viscosity ν was
originally proposed by G. I. Taylor[1]. Its importance is
so recognized now that it is commonly referred to as the
“zeroth law” of turbulence. Its existence was assumed by
von K´arm´an and Howarth, Loitsianskii and also, signiﬁ-
cantly, Kolmogorov[2] in establishing his celebrated simi-
larity hypotheses for the structure of the inertial range of
turbulence. Kolmogorov assumed the small scale struc-
ture of turbulence to be locally isotropic in space and
locally stationary in time - which implies the equality
of turbulent kinetic energy injection at the large scales
with the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation at
the small scales[3]. Although this view should be strictly
applied only to steady turbulence, the mechanism of the
dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy can be considered

the most fundamental aspect of turbulence not only from
a theoretical viewpoint but also from a turbulence model-
ing viewpoint. Indeed, the mechanism that sets the level
of turbulent dissipation in ﬂows that are unsteady is a
diﬃcult, if not intractable, aspect of turbulence model-
ing.

The rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is de-
termined by the rate of energy passed from the large-scale
eddies to the next smaller scale eddies via a forward cas-
cade until the energy is eventually dissipated by viscosity.
Thus, Cε deﬁned as,

Cε = εL/u′3

,

(1)

(here, ε is the mean energy dissipation rate per unit
mass, L and u′ are characteristic large length and ve-
locity scales respectively) should be independent of the
Reynolds number and of order unity. An increase in
Reynolds number should only result in an increase in the
typical wave number where dissipation takes place[4]. In
the past few years there have been a number of numerical
(see Ref. [5] and references therein) and experimental (see
Refs. [6, 7, 8] for recent results) eﬀorts to determine the
value of Cε and its dependence on the Reynolds number.
Perhaps the most convincing of these are the numerical
attempts since there is no re-course to one-dimensional

surrogacy as there is for experiments. Notwithstanding
this fact, there is good agreement, both numerically and
experimentally, with the long held view that Cε is ∼ O(1)
when the Reynolds number is suﬃciently high. The col-
lection of isotropic simulation results for Cε shown in Ref.
[5] indicates that “high enough” Reynolds number ap-
pears to be Reλ ∼ O(100). Here, Reλ(= u′2[15/νε]1/2) is
the Taylor microscale Reynolds number. At higher Reλ,
slow Reλ dependencies for Cε, such as that proposed by
Lohse[9], cannot be ruled out. Measuring such Reλ de-
pendencies, either numerically or experimentally, will be
close to impossible.

One unresolved issue is that raised by Sreenivasan[10].
After assembling all the then known experimental de-
caying grid turbulence data[11] and numerical data for
both decaying and stationary isotropic turbulence he con-
cludes that “the asymptotic value (of Cε) might depend
on the nature of large-scale forcing, or, perhaps, on the
structure of the large scale.” He also demonstrates[12]
in homogeneously sheared ﬂows that the large structure
does inﬂuence Cε. However, it might be argued that these
results were obtained at low Reynolds numbers and the
issue of a universal asymptotic value for Cε could still
be considered open. Alternatively it could be argued
that homogeneous shear ﬂows and the like are strictly un-
steady turbulent ﬂows and the zeroth law, in its simplest
guise, should not be expected to apply to such ﬂows. The
possibility of some characteristics of large-scale turbu-
lence being universal should not be ruled out. The recent
observation that input power ﬂuctuations, when properly
re-scaled, appear universal[13] may be construed to sug-
gest the possibility of universality for Cε. The aim of the
present work is to estimate Cε from direct numerical sim-
ulations (DNS) of statistically stationary isotropic turbu-
lence and compare with previously reported DNS results
(summarized in Fig. 3 of Ref. [5]) and experiments car-
ried out in regions of low (dU/dy ≈ dU/dy|max/2) or zero
mean shear. The present DNS scheme diﬀers from meth-
ods already reported in that a high-order ﬁnite diﬀerence
method is used. To our knowledge, these are the ﬁrst ﬁ-
nite diﬀerence results for Cε. Hence, it is worthwhile to
test if diﬀerent numerics and forcing at the large scales
result in vastly diﬀerent values for Cε to those already
reported.

3 δij ∇ · u is the traceless rate
of strain tensor. In the numerical simulations the system
is forced (stirred) using random transversal waves given
by

f (x, t) = f0e cos [ik(t) · x + iφ(t)] ,

(5)

where k(t) is a wave number with magnitude between 1
and 2, while φ(t) is a phase between −π and π. Both
φ(t) and k(t) are chosen randomly at each time step giv-
ing a forcing that is delta-correlated in time. The ran-
dom unit vector e is perpendicular to k and the forcing
amplitude f0 is chosen such that the root mean square
Mach number for all runs is between 0.13 and 0.15 which
is not too dissimilar to that found in the wind-tunnel
experiments to be discussed in the next section. For
these weakly compressible simulations, the energies of
solenoidal and potential components of the ﬂow have a
ratio Epot/Esol ≈ 10−4–10−2 for most scales; only to-
wards the Nyquist frequency (henceforth kmax) does the
ratio increase to about 0.1. It is thus reasonable to as-
sume that compressibility is irrelevant for the results pre-
sented here whilst at the same time the present results
can be considered more comparable and relevant to ex-
perimental wind tunnel ﬂows than the perfectly incom-
pressible simulations published so far. The code has been
validated in previous turbulence studies and the reader
is referred to Refs.[14, 15, 16] and the code web-site[17]
for more information.

The simulations are carried out in periodic boxes with
resolutions in the range of 323 − 5123 grid points. The
box size is Lx = Ly = Lz = 2π, which discretizes the
wave numbers in units of 1. The viscosity ν is chosen
such that the maximum resolved wave number kmax is
always greater than 1.5/η, where η = (ν3/ε)1/4 is the
Kolmogorov length scale.

ies, the total kinetic energy E is deﬁned as,

III. RESULTS

A. Numerical results

In this section results for the higher order ﬁnite dif-
ference numerical simulations are presented. The simu-
lations began with N = 323 and each subsequent larger
box size began with a velocity ﬁeld interpolated from the
previous box size. Figures 1(a)-(d) show example time se-
ries from Run E (N = 2563) for the ﬂuctuating velocity
u, the ﬂuctuating integral length scale L, the ﬂuctuat-
ing kinetic energy dissipation rate ε and the ﬂuctuating
Reynolds number Reλ respectively. Initially, the turbu-
lence takes a short amount of time to reach a statistically
stationary state - a consequence of stabilizing the new
run from the previously converged run. The ﬂuctuating
quantities shown in Figures 1(a)-(d) are not unlike those

easily be mistaken for a hot-wire trace of a turbulent
ﬂow. This is in stark contrast to some pseudo-spectral
methods that use negative viscosity to maintain a con-
stant energy level. For example, it is worth comparing
Figs. 1(b)-(d) with those shown in Ref.
[18] [i.e. their
Figs. (2)-(7)]. The pseudo spectral results show that the
same quantities only ﬂuctuate with a comparatively long
period.

Given that the statistics are ﬂuctuating, although they
are statistically stationary, it is tempting to plot the in-
stantaneous Cε as a function of Reλ. Figure 2 shows Cε
calculated in such a way. The Reλ dependent trends are
obviously not as expected. However, it is worth noting
the apparent range for Cε when Reλ & 50 is ≈ 0.3 − 0.7
which is the range of previously published DNS results.
This may explain the scatter in previously published DNS
results if Cε is calculated from a subjective choice of ε, L
and u′ at a single time step e.g. as in Ref. [5]. The reason
for the incorrect Reλ dependence for Cε can be gleaned
from Figs. 1(a) and (b). Figure 1(a) shows that an in-
tense burst in turbulent kinetic energy u2 (an example
is noted by the arrow) can be observed some maximum
time lag τmax later in the turbulent kinetic energy dissi-
pation rate [Figure 1(b), again noted by an arrow]. More
about the signiﬁcance of τmax will be discussed later in

With this done for all runs it is possible to shift the
time series of ε(t) for each run by its respective τmax
and correctly calculate the instantaneous magnitude of
Cε. Figure 5 shows the newly calculated Reλ dependence
of Cε using the correct time lag τmax for each of the
runs. A number of comments can be made. Firstly, the
dimensionless dissipation rate Cε appears to asymptote
when Reλ & 100. The asymptotic magnitude Cε ≈ 0.5 is
in good agreement with the consensus DNS results pub-
lished so far i.e. Cε ≈ 0.4 to 0.5. (see Ref.
[5] and ref-
erences therein). Having said this and given the present
demonstration that it is incorrect to estimate Cε from
a single time snap shot it would be interesting to recal-
culate previously published results based on subjective
choices of the quantities involved for estimating Cε by
using the entire time series. Lastly, the present results
verify the use of a high-order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme and
also prove that the zeroth law applies to slightly com-
pressible turbulence.

Having estimated τmax and assuming it approximates
the average time τ for the energy to cascade from the
large energetic scales to the small dissipative scales it is
worth comparing the present results with a simple cas-
cade model such as that discussed by Lumley[4]. Using a
forward cascade model, whereby the spectrum is divided
logarithmically into eddies which have the same width in
wave number space as their center wave number, the to-
tal time taken for energy to cross the spectrum, assuming
that all energy is passed directly to the next wave num-

As noted by Lumley, little attention should be paid to
the numerical values of the coeﬃcients, though attention
should be paid to the exponent for Reλ. For small val-
ues of τ +, e.g. τ + < 1, the large scale energy is directly
aﬀected by viscosity and has little chance of transferring
energy in a classical cascade manner, whilst for large val-
ues of τ +, e.g. τ + > 1, the large scales have the time
for grinding down energy unaﬀected by viscosity. The
asymptotic assumption of Eq. (10) is 2 eddy turnovers.
Figure 6(a) shows the Reλ dependence of τ + compared
with Eq. (10). The present results are much lower than
the prediction of Eq. (10) and this is probably indicative
of the fact that the energy cascade is not a simple full
transfer of energy between neighboring wave numbers, for
low Reλ at least. It is more likely that, whilst most of the
energy is passed to neighboring wave numbers, a dimin-
ishing amount of the energy is passed to all higher wave
numbers. What is noticeable from the present results is
that τ + ≈ 1 will not occur until Reλ ≈ 300 which is an
Reλ at which the Reλ dependence of Cε will become, ei-
ther numerically or experimentally, unmeasurable. There
is no reason not to expect that at high enough Reλ full en-
ergy transfer may occur between neighboring wave num-

Reλ ∽ O(103) will τ + ≈ 2.

B. Experimental results revisited

Results for the present experiment, originally pub-
lished in Ref. [6], are updated here with more data within
the range 170 . Reλ . 1210. Detailed experimental con-
ditions can be found in Refs. [6, 8] and need not be re-
peated here. The main group of measurements are from a
geometry called a Norman grid which generates a decay-
ing wake ﬂow. The geometry is composed of a perforated

The ﬂow cannot be classed as freely decaying as the ex-
tent of the wind tunnel cross section (1.8 × 2.7 m2) is
approximately 7 × 11 L2. For all the ﬂows presented in
Ref. [6], signals of the ﬂuctuating longitudinal velocity u
are acquired, for the most part, on the mean shear proﬁle
centerline. For the Norman grid, some data is also ob-
tained slightly oﬀ the center-line at a transverse distance
of one mesh height where dU/dy ≈ dU/dy|max/2.

i.e. Lp = 1/k1,p[4, 19]. As well the Norman grid
data, the recent cryogenic decaying grid turbulence of
White[7] measured using the particle image velocimetry
(PIV) technique are included.

All data are acquired using the constant temperature
anemometry (CTA) hot-wire technique with a single-
wire probe made of 1.27µm diameter Wollaston (Pt-10%
Rh) wire. The instantaneous bridge voltage is buck-and-
gained and the ampliﬁed signals are low-pass ﬁltered flp
with the sampling frequency fs always at least twice
flp. The resulting signal is recorded with 12-bit reso-
lution. Time lags τ and frequencies f are converted to
streamwise distance (≡ τ U ) and one-dimensional longi-
(≡ 2πf /U ) respectively using
tudinal wave number k1
Taylor’s hypothesis. The mean dissipation rate ε is es-
timated assuming isotropy of the velocity derivatives i.e.
ε ≡ εiso = 15νh(∂u/∂x)2i. We estimate h(∂u/∂x)2i from
the average value of E1D(k1) [the 1-dimensional energy
∞
spectrum of u such that u2 =
0 E1D(k1)dk1 and from
ﬁnite diﬀerences h(∂u/∂x)2i = hui+1 − uii2/(U fs)2].
R

No corrections for the decrease in wire resolution asso-
ciated with an increase in Reλ are made since all meth-
ods known to us rely on an assumed distribution for
the three-dimensional energy spectrum. For most of the
data, the worst wire resolution is ≈ 2η where η is the
dissipative length scale ≡ ν3/4ε−1/4
. The present in-
vestigation is limited to one-dimensional measurements
and suitable surrogates for Eq. (1). Although caution
should be exercised when higher-order moments of a
one-dimensional surrogate are substituted for the three-
dimensional equivalent, the use of the mean quantity εiso
for ε should not be too problematic here. The charac-
teristic length-scale of the large-scale motions L is Lp
and is estimated from the wave number k1,p at which

Figure 7 shows Cε for the present data and that of
Ref. [7]. For all of the data, a value of Cε ≈ 0.5 appears to
be the average value. It should be noted that estimates of
Cε from the cryogenic decaying grid data are based on the
transverse equivalents of the quantities that constitute
Eq. (1). The majority of the scatter for the cryogenic
data is due to the uncertainty of L which is extremely
diﬃcult to estimate from PIV data. Figure 7 conﬁrms
that Cε, albeit a one-dimensional surrogate, measured in
a number of diﬀerent ﬂows is independent of Reλ. It could
be argued that the rate of approach to an asymptotic
value depends on the ﬂow e.g. proximity to initial and
boundary conditions. The asymptotic value Cε ≈ 0.5
is in excellent agreement with the present DNS results.
These experimental results are encouraging considering
that wind-tunnel turbulence is always relatively young

turbulence and the statistical stationarity is achieved
with a random phase forcing applied at low wave num-
bers. The main result of the numerical simulations is the
demonstration that Cε should only be estimated with
ensemble averaged quantities from the entire time series
for which the statistics are stationary.
If Cε is to be
estimated at each time snap shot it is necessary to cor-
rectly account for the time lag that occurs from the large
scale energy injection to the ﬁne scale energy dissipation.
Even after correctly correlating the energy injection with
the energy dissipation, the instantaneous value of Cε can
vary quite considerably (e.g. ±30%) over the extent of the
simulation. Such a variation may account for the scatter
in magnitude of Cε in previously published results. Both
the present numerical and experimental results suggest
that the asymptotic value for Cε is ≈ 0.5. In light of this,
the previously held view that the asymptotic value of
Cε may be dependent on the large scale energy injection
could be suspect. Lastly, the results presented are strictly
applicable only to isotropic turbulence that is stationary
in time. However, it would be interesting to estimate Cε
for simulations of turbulence unsteady in space and/or
time e.g. anisotropic turbulence or anisotropic homoge-
neous turbulence with a mean shear because there is lit-
tle known for these ﬂows about how the turbulent kinetic
energy is dissipated.

IV. FINAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS

Acknowledgments

The present work has revisited the zeroth law of tur-
bulence for both numerical simulations of statistically
stationary isotropic turbulence and experiments. The
numerical simulations are slightly compressible isotropic

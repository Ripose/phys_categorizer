We implement the level set method for numerial simulation of the motion of a suspended partile

onveted by the (cid:29)uid (cid:29)ow in a mirohannel. The method automatially ope with the interations

between the partile and the hannel walls. We apply the method in a study of partiles moving in

a hannel with obstales of di(cid:27)erent shapes. The generality of the method also makes it appliable

for simulations of motion of partiles under in(cid:29)uene of external fores.

The rate of hange of the momentum of the (cid:29)uid is

been developed to analyze biologial samples. Many of

these systems rely on handling of partiles and ells om-

ing them. Examples of suh mirosystems are bumper-

arrays or DEP-systems [1, 2, 3, 4℄

It is a ma jor hallenge in theoretial miro(cid:29)uidis to

study the dynamis of partiles of (cid:28)nite size when they

are onveted by a (cid:29)uid (cid:29)ow. Espeially problemati is

The level set method [5℄ is well suited to ope with

these problems. By introduing a hypersurfae φ(r, t),

where σ is the stress tensor modelled by

the partile interfae is represented as the zero level set

φ(r, t) = 0. The ma jor advantage of the method is that

this zero level set an be alulated impliitly instead of

We onsider miro(cid:29)uidi systems. Hene the hara-

In the seond equality we have used Gauss' theorem as

veloities are muh smaller than the propagation of pres-

sure (the speed of sound). We an therefore onsider the

(cid:29)uids to be inompressible and the ontinuity ondition

well as the Young(cid:21)Laplae law relating the pressure drop

holds true for the veloity (cid:28)eld u of the (cid:29)uid.

Consider a domain Ω onsisting of two subdomains Ω1
and Ω2 with surfaes ∂Ω1 and ∂Ω2 , respetively. The

To failitate numerial omputation it is desirable to

rewrite the last integral in Eq. (5) as a volume integral

like the rest of the terms. This an be ahieved by intro-

duing a level set funtion φ(r, t) as we will show in the

Following Ref. [6℄ we introdue a level set funtion

φ(r, t) with the properties

φ(r, t) > 0,
φ(r, t) = 0,
φ(r, t) < 0,

r ∈ Ω1 ,
r ∈ Γ,
r ∈ Ω2 .

This funtion uniquely de(cid:28)nes the interfae as Γ(t) =
{r|φ(r, t) = 0} and permits us to distinguish eah sub-
domain by the sign of φ. We also introdue a transverse
level set funtion ψ(r, t) suh that

whih is the level set formulation of the Navier(cid:21)Stokes

equation.

In order to have the system ompletely desribed by

dynamial equations we (cid:28)nally need an equation desrib-

ing the evolution of the zero level set. We only need to

onsider the movement of the zero level set beause this

they enter impliitly through the stress tensor σ and the

FIG. 1: For the test study we use the geometry and mesh

interfae throughout the alulations. This requires that

shown in the (cid:28)gure. The general shape of the obstale is as

the gradient of the level set funtion is onstant within

a region around the interfae |φ| < ǫ. This is not au-

tomatially ful(cid:28)lled. The time evolution of any level set

φ(r, t) = C is given by the level set Eq. (16). This means

that the height of the level set funtion will remain on-

stant, but it does not ensure that the gradient does not

hange. Thus in order to keep a (cid:28)xed interfae thik-

ness we need to reinitialize the level set funtion without

hanging the zero level set.

In priniple we an use any funtion that ful(cid:28)lls

Eq. (6), sine only the zero level set has a physial in-

terpretation. But requiring the interfae thikness to be

(cid:28)xed onstrains the gradient of φ to be (cid:28)xed in a region
around the interfae. A hoie of φ(r, t) that ful(cid:28)lls these

requirements is the signed distane funtion, where the

distane is the shortest distane d(r) from a point to the

interfae

d(r) = ± min(|r − rΓ|),

rΓ being the points on the interfae. The plus sign applies
if r ∈ Ω1 and the minus sign if r ∈ Ω2 . The length of the

gradient for this partiular hoie of level set funtion is

shown in the lower inset on the right. The radius a of the

rounded orner was hanged from one simulation to the next.

The aspet size of the obstale is l. The height of the hannel
is H = (20/3)l and the width of the hannel is W = (13/3)l.

The upper inset on the right shows the general idea of the

test study: The partiles start in the initial position x0 and
the (cid:28)nal position xﬁnal is reorded.

The reinitialization equation is already on a form suit-

able for implementation in Femlab. Simply letting F

equal the right hand side of the equation and setting

da = 1 and Γ = 0 with Uψ = ψ does the trik.

To avoid mass loss during the reinitialisation proedure

we have put a onstraint on the solution: the volume of

the partile must be onstant at all time. This is done

in Femlab via the (cid:28)eld fem.equ.onstr where we on-

strain the di(cid:27)erene between the integrals of the smeared

(32)

out Heaviside funtion Hǫ(ψ) at time τ and the smeared
out Heaviside funtion Hǫ(φ) at time t = 0 to be zero.

The integrals are omputed by using the integration ou-

pling variables in Femlab.

|∇φ| = 1.

V. MODEL SYSTEM AND SETUP

We have implemented two di(cid:27)erent reinitilization pro-

edures. One simple reinitialization proedure where we

realulate the level set funtion at every time step and

one using the reinitialization equation suggested by Suss-

η2 of the partile was 100 times larger than the visosity

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the level set method is easily im-

plementable in Femlab and that it is a suitable method

for oping with the interation fores between partiles

From whih follows

and hard walls automatially. Partiles an be modelled

as very visous liquid drops and the shape preservation

an be taken are of trough an appropriate reinitializa-

We have used a simple shape preserving reinitializa-

tion method. Further work is needed in order to on-

and thus

vet partiles of an arbitrary (cid:28)xed shape. One promising

reinitialisation sheme is the partile level set method

suggested by Enright et al. [10℄.

This means that ψ is well de(cid:28)ned in a small region around

orthogonal and that |∇ψ| 6= 0. The orthogonality an be

The level set method might prove useful when simu-

lating miro(cid:29)uidi systems for partile handling. In this

paper we have only onsidered the fores exerted on the

partiles by the onveting (cid:29)uid and thereby indiretly

suh as DEP fores or magneti fores ould be taken into

aount making the method appliable for simulations of

many lab-on-a-hip systems fabriated today.

We demonstrate how to onstrut the transverse level

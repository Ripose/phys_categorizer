Using high Reynolds number experimental data, we search for most dissipative, most
intense structures. These structures possess a scaling predicted by log-Poisson model for the
eαa, has
dissipation ﬁeld εr. The probability distribution function for the exponents α, εr ∼
been constructed, and compared with Poisson distribution. These new experimental data
suggest that the most intense structures have co-dimension less than 2. The log-Poisson
statistics is compared with log-binomial which follows from the random β-model.

Self-similar properties of turbulence, suggested by Kol-
mogorov [1], have been intensively studied for a long
time. The theory predicted simple scaling for the lon-
rζp ,
gitudinal velocity increments,
where ζp = p/3. It became clear, however, that there are
corrections to this scaling, ζp = p/3 + τ (p/3), due to in-
termittency. A theory, incorporating the intermittency,
the reﬁned similarity hypothesis [2], links the statistic of
these corrections with the statistic of the dissipation ﬁeld
εr, the energy dissipation averaged over a ball of size r.
rτ (p). Many models have been proposed
Namely,
to explain intermittency. It was originally suggested that
the statistics of εr is log-normal [2]. More recently, She
and L´evˆeque [3] (hereafter SL, see also [4], [5], and re-
cent study [6]) have proposed log-Poisson statistics for
the dissipation ﬁeld, the theory resulting in a remarkable
agreement with the experimentally found ζp in [7], [8].
These experimental exponents are obtained in Extended
Self-Similarity approach, which is useful because of ex-
tended scaling range. In the following, we will also use
these experimental exponents to compare with SL theory
with slightly modiﬁed parameters.

Consider the Poisson distribution (see, e.g., [9]):

P (α, ξ) = e−ξξα/α!, α = 0, 1, 2, ..., εr = eαa+b,

SL is recovered from (2) if C = 2, γ = 2/3, so that a =
ln (2/3), C being the co-dimension of most dissipative
structures, and γ is deﬁned by the dissipation rate, i.e.,
inverse time-scale, 1/tr ∼
The meaning of C becomes even more clear directly
from (1): the most intense ﬂuctuations correspond to
α = 0 (as a < 0), so that the probability P (α = 0) =

ﬁtting of the experimental data (solid thick line) has been
extended to reach unity (solid line), where it is supposed to
match with SL scaling. The distances are given in terms of
Kolmogorov micro-scale η.

We used 10 million points of atmospheric data from
Yale University, with an estimated Taylor microscale
Reynolds number 9540 (courtesy of Sreenivasan). The
data are treated in spirit of Taylor hypothesis, that is,
the time series is treated as one-dimensional cut of the
process. We denote ω = ∂xu, u is longitudinal velocity

and maxima of εr can be measured. Figure 1 shows a
remarkable scaling for this quantity for 4.5 decades. The
deviation from SL is small, and we recall that SL suggest
that there is no anomalous scaling for tr. This small
deviation in Fig. 1 can be interpreted

stead of making use of inverse Legendre transform of the
spectrum (2), we provide direct measurements of the ex-
ponents α.

Figure 2 shows two typical PDF’s for two distances. It
is clearly seen that the SL theory is well conﬁrmed: the
experimental PDF’s are quite close to the correspond-
ing Poisson distributions. The deviation is observed only
at large α, i.e., (exponentially) small εr, for which the
theory does not claim to account for. The latter

as anomalous persistence of the eddies, which is indeed
observed [10], see also discussion in [11]. The value of
γ is 0.61
0.01, only slightly smaller than 2/3. Note
that maxima are not always predictable; e.g., for log-
normal distribution, the maximum could be anything.
Another point: the measurements of maxima is mean-
ingful because the coarse-grain averaging (4) is already
present.
In order to compare with a “regular” ran-
dom process we generated a Gaussian process ωg with
correlation function coinciding with experimental, i.e.,
. Then, the “dissipa-

responding calculation for the maxima are reported in
Fig. 1. If any scaling can be extracted from the Gaus-
sian process, it would be at large asymptotic distances,
and the scaling is trivial, γ = 0, meaning no singularity.
Another testing of the theory is presented by direct
measurements of the exponents α in (3). We may con-
struct a PDF for α-distribution, measuring ln εr, and tak-

Although the experimental γ is not that diﬀerent from
2/3, the value of the other parameter C is quite sensi-
tive to that diﬀerence. In order to ﬁnd C we substitute
γ from our measurements into (2), and use computer
routines to ﬁnd a best ﬁt for these data with free pa-
rameter C and the exponents ζ(ESS)

Note that if we substitute in (2) the value of γ from the
experiment, and put C = 2, then, for the obtained expo-
nents, ζ(C=2)
= 0.050,
much too high. Figure 3 shows τ (p/3) from experiment,
and for diﬀerent theories.
It can be seen that all the
curves collapse into one, corresponding to the experi-
ment, except that one with γ from our measurements,
and C = 2. This illustrates that the data are indeed sen-
sitive to the measured γ, that is to its (small) diﬀerence
from 2/3. The codimension C = 1.67 corresponds to
H0 = 1.33. This value of H0 > 1 seems to be consistent
with the distinction between persistent vortical ﬁlaments
and the dissipative structures associated with regions of
strong strain [13]. That means that the most dissipative
structures consist not only of ﬁlaments, but in part of
sheets, or ﬁlaments convoluted into complex structures,
covering more than 1 dimension.

dimension in 3D simulations directly. Another reason for

These statements about the dimensions of the most
intense structures can be also formulated for log-binomial
distribution, and, it is known that the Poisson process is
a limit of the binomial distribution for “rare events”. In
particular, the Poisson distribution can be obtained from
the random β-model [12] by a suitable limiting process

The log-binomial distribution generally cannot be re-
duced to the log-Poisson PDF: in particular, even if x
is small, and Γ = 1/21/D, then, τ (p)
0, and
thus the intermittency is negligible . Then, at ﬁrst
sight, the log-binomial distribution is not suitable for
our purpose. Indeed, according to the central limit the-
orem, the binomial distribution is asymptotically nor-
mal at n
1, and the log-normal distribution has un-
surmountable shortcomings [20], [21]. Nevertheless, the
spectrum (6) does not even look like log-normal (for
which τ (p) =
1)) and rather behaves like log-
Poisson for p

mal distribution if formed, do not contribute substan-
tially. In contrast, only the ﬁrst few terms of this sum
(responsible for ”rare” and very intense events) really
contribute. Thus, eﬀectively, the distribution works like
a Poisson distribution. To see this explicitly, consider
a probability distribution (n

If we take the random β model “for real”, that is, con-

binomial, as in (11), then we are dealing with (6) with
γβ given from our measurements (so that β2 is deﬁned
according to (7)). And the second parameter, the co-
dimension Cβ from (8), can be found from the best ﬁt
with the experimental data [7], [8] - using computer rou-
tines analogous to those we used for the Poisson distribu-

conclude that the estimated Hausdorﬀ co-dimension of
the most intense structures is less than 2.

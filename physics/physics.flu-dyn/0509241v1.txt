We develop a ﬂux-conservative formalism for a Newtonian multi-ﬂuid system, including dissipation
and entrainment (i.e. allowing the momentum of one ﬂuid to be a linear combination of the velocities
of all ﬂuids). Maximum use is made of mass, energy, and linear and angular momentum conservation
to specify the equations of motion. Also used extensively are insights gleaned from a convective
variational action principle, key being the distinction between each velocity and its canonically
conjugate momentum (which is modiﬁed because of entrainment). Dissipation is incorporated
to second order in the “thermodynamic forces” via the approach pioneered by Onsager, which
makes it transparent how to guarantee the law of increase of entropy. An immediate goal of
the investigation is to understand better the number, and form, of independent dissipation terms
required for a consistent set of equations of motion in the multi-ﬂuid context. A signiﬁcant, but
seemingly innocuous detail, is that one must be careful to isolate “forces” that can be written as total
gradients, otherwise errors can be made in relating the net internal force to the net externally applied
force. Our long-range aim is to provide a formalism that can be used to model dynamical multi-
ﬂuid systems both perturbatively and via fully nonlinear 3D numerical evolutions. To elucidate the
formalism we consider the standard model for a heat-conducting, superﬂuid neutron star, which is
believed to be dominated by superﬂuid neutrons, superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate,
ultra-relativistic gas of normal ﬂuid electrons. We determine that in this case there are, in principle,
19 dissipation coeﬃcients in the ﬁnal set of equations. A ﬁnal reduction of the system is made by
neglecting heat conduction. This leads to an extension of the standard two-ﬂuid model for neutron
star cores, which has been used in a number of previous applications, and illustrates how mutual
friction is represented in our formalism.

INTRODUCTION

The chemistry community has great experience in dealing with multi-ﬂuid systems. Perhaps indicative of the
cultural divide between research areas is the development of a multi-ﬂuid literature for superﬂuid neutron stars which
largely ignores the chemistry successes. Of particular note is the Onsager formulation of dissipative, multi-ﬂuid
systems [1]. On the other hand, action-based derivations of the equations of motion for multi-ﬂuid systems [2–5]
In this work, we attempt to span the divide by
have, as far as we can tell, not crossed over in the other direction.
utilizing fully mass, energy, and linear and angular momentum conservation, the Onsager formulation, and action-
based constructs to build a general dissipative model for multi-ﬂuid systems. We facilitate our use of the conservation
laws by borrowing from the engineering community the idea of “control” volumes. Even though we restrict the
discussion to the Newtonian regime, we do not hesitate to use ideas that have been developed for general relativity.
In fact, the analysis is often much simpliﬁed if the true covariant nature of the physics is retained.

Although much of our analysis is general, and can be used in any multi-constituent ﬂuid context—for example,
superﬂuid Helium and bubbly liquid/gas mixtures (see [6] for a general review of two-phase ﬂow, and a series of
papers by Geurst [7–9] for interesting discussions), our immediate goal is to produce a formalism that can be applied
to Newtonian superﬂuid neutron stars, in order to model their detailed dynamics. The importance of this target
is enhanced by the fact that the ﬁrst generation of large-scale, ground-based, gravitational-wave detectors are now
operating near their design sensitivity [10]. Mature neutron stars can radiate gravitationally in a number of ways,

many of which depend crucially on dissipation in the superﬂuid interior. An obvious example is the potentially strong
damping of gravitational-wave driven mode-instabilities (eg. of the so-called r-modes) due to either superﬂuid mutual
friction [11, 12] or a viscous boundary layer at the neutron star core-crust interface [13, 14]. Other astrophysical
contexts requiring a detailed model for superﬂuid dissipation include the pulsar glitches [15], the standard model for
which is based on the transfer of angular momentum between components rotating relative to each other, and possible
neutron star free precession [16], the damping of which depends crucially on the interior viscosity.

In the standard superﬂuid neutron star model, the neutrons in the inner crust and the outer core are believed to be
superﬂuid, and the protons in the outer core are thought to be superconducting. Because of overall charge neutrality,
the neutrons and protons will coexist with a normal, but highly degenerate ﬂuid of electrons (and possibly muons in
the more dense regions). At the core temperature expected in a mature neutron star (likely four orders of magnitude
below the relevant Fermi temperatures), the superﬂuid and superconducting nature, respectively, of the neutrons and
protons implies that they function as dynamically independent, interpenetrating ﬂuids. The conventional wisdom is
that viscous damping of the oscillations of these objects is a result of electron-electron scattering. However, this begs
the following question: how is it that damping of the electron motion on the one hand leads to damping, on the other
hand, of the superﬂuid neutrons, which make up the bulk of the matter in the star? Despite these kinds of problems
having been studied for decades [17, 18], the answer is not at all obvious from the extant literature (although we
have recently clariﬁed some aspects in [19, 20]).
Indeed, the conventional wisdom seems to have been guided by the
classic discussion of Cutler and Lindblom [21], who noted that “neutron star matter becomes more viscous in the
superﬂuid state than it was in the normal state.” However, while they included the eﬀect of superﬂuidity in their
determination of the viscosity coeﬃcients, they did not consider the eﬀect on the actual ﬂuid dynamics. Obviously
aware of this fact, they remark that “The superﬂuidity of neutron star matter, will, of course, have drastic eﬀects both
on the dissipation coeﬃcients and on the dynamics of this material.” The implications of the ﬁrst statement on the
possibility of detectable gravitational radiation from neutron stars are potentially far-ranging, leading most directly
to the conclusion that gravitational-wave driven instabilities are ineﬀective in mature neutron stars [11], provided, of
course, that superﬂuid dynamics can be ignored. However, subsequent work on the role of superﬂuidity in neutron
stars reveals that the eﬀects on the dynamics can be signiﬁcant, and sometimes unanticipated (see [22–25] for recent
discussions).

To date, most studies of superﬂuid neutron stars have drawn upon Landau’s original two-ﬂuid model for He4
In the case of neutron stars, both neutrons and protons are expected to form Cooper pairs, which then form
[26].
condensates which at the ﬂuid level can be described by the standard equations. The main distinction in the neutron
star case is that the two ﬂuids no longer represent the superﬂuid and normal parts of a single particle species. Instead,
the two degrees of freedom describe the neutrons and a conglomerate of all charged components which are expected
to be electromagnetically coupled on a short timescale. Following the traditional route, Mendell [18, 27] extended
the non-dissipative zero-temperature equations to account for the main dissipation mechanisms. The result is a set
of equations which include the mutual friction coupling due to electrons scattering oﬀ of rotational vortices in the
condensates (see also [20]). These equations were later used to study the damping of unstable modes of oscillation in
a spinning neutron star. The conclusion drawn from this work is that mutual friction is a key dissipation mechanism
which may, in fact, suppress rotational instabilities entirely [12, 28].

As the work of Mendell shows, the mathematical description of the problem becomes considerably more complicated
once the so-called entrainment eﬀect [29], which accounts for the fact that the ﬂow of one ﬂuid may impart momentum
in the other ﬂuid, is included. This complexity is partly due to a common confusion concerning Landau’s description
of superﬂuid hydrodynamics. At the heart of the problem lies a failure to distinguish clearly between transport
velocities and momenta. This distinction is made clear in recent variational formulations of the problem [2–5], work
which draws heavily on the fully covariant relativistic description of Carter and collaborators [30–36], and which
incorporates entrainment in a natural way. This leads to a mathematical description which is in many ways less
complex than the standard one.

Our present analysis diﬀers somewhat from the recent variational derivations [2–5] by emphasizing the conservations
laws for mass, linear and angular momentum, and energy. We ﬁnd this approach appealing because it stays close
to our physical intuition.
Furthermore, we believe that our discussion may serve as a useful “introduction” to
the more technically involved work described in [2–5]. Of course, we rely heavily on the variational methods for
rigorous mathematical support of our results in the non-dissipative case. Until very recently there had been no
serious discussion of the dissipative problem within the variational framework. The discussion by Carter and Chamel
[3–5] provided a useful ﬁrst step by translating (and extending somewhat) the covariant relativistic model devised by
Carter [30] and Carter and Khalatnikov [37], yet the discussion remains somewhat abstract. A key aim of the present
discussion is to make contact with applications and prepare the ground for building realistic models of astrophysical
superﬂuids.

The present work has two main aims. First of all, we want to consider the multi-ﬂuid dissipation problem in
“complete” generality. In doing this we rely on the key conservation laws and ask what the most general form for the

3

dissipation and interaction forces may be. The dissipative terms are then constrained by ensuring that the second law
of thermodynamics is satisﬁed. To make progress in this direction we make use of Onsager’s celebrated symmetry
principle [1]. Our derivation follows the guidelines set out in work on superﬂuid He4 (see [38] and [39] for nice
descriptions) and is basically an extension of the general analysis championed, for instance, by Landau and Lifshitz
[26] for one-ﬂuid systems. We extend previous work in two important ways: we include the entrainment eﬀect in
a (hopefully) clear way, and we also allow for the presence of mutual interaction terms which have traditionally not
been considered (eg. in [3–5]). The latter turns out to be crucial if we want to be able to represent the mutual friction
forces which arise due to the presence of vortices. Up to this point, i.e. in Secs. II and III, the discussion is general
and should be relevant for any multi-ﬂuid system. Our second objective is met in Sec. IV, where we specify the
equations to the conditions that should prevail in the outer core of a mature neutron star. We consider a mixture of
superﬂuid neutrons, superconducting protons, normal electrons and entropy. This model is instructive in a number
of ways. We show how the dynamical degrees of freedom are reduced in a natural way if we assume that the electrons
and protons are coupled electromagnetically. (It should be noted that we do not account for detailed electromagnetic
eﬀects in this analysis [40].) We also deduce that this system in general requires the speciﬁcation of no less than
19 distinct dissipation coeﬃcients. This discussion is followed, and the paper concluded, by a ﬁnal reduction to the
dissipative extension of the standard two-ﬂuid model which has been used in recent work on neutron star dynamics.
This model, which is obtained by neglecting heat conduction, provides the simplest system that should be considered
in “realistic” applications. We discuss the interpretation of the various dissipative terms, some of which appear to
be new.
In particular, we show how the standard form for the mutual friction force [20] is represented within our
formalism.

II. CONSERVATION LAWS FOR MULTI-FLUID SYSTEMS

Any general ﬂuid formalism must respect the three laws concerning

Conservation of Linear and Angular Momentum

Conservation of Mass

Conservation of Energy

•

•

•

Although entropy is not conserved in general, the law of increase of entropy is also a vital property of any ﬂuid.
In
imposing these conservation laws for a multi-ﬂuid system, we consider some “control volume” V with boundary ∂V ,
letting ηi denote the unit normal form to ∂V . The control volume is to be contrasted with the notion of a ﬂuid
element, which is a region of the ﬂuid small enough to be considered “inﬁnitesimal” with respect to the whole ﬂuid
and yet contain enough particles that a (local) thermodynamic treatment is warranted.

We consider a general multi-ﬂuid system, the dynamical description of which is based on determining the space and
time dependence of each particle number density nx and the corresponding particle number density current ni
x. These
are natural variables to use in describing the system.
It is assumed that the diﬀerent ﬂuids are interpenetrating,
i.e. the diﬀerent constituents do not have to be separated by interfaces. We let x, y, z be particle constituent indices
that range over the whole set of ﬂuids in the system. Repeated constituent indices will not satisfy a summation
convention, but vector indices i, j, k do satisfy such a convention (as usual). Ostensibly, all formulas will be written
in a general coordinate basis, with gij = gji representing the (ﬂat-space) metric, except for certain integrals written
below, where a Cartesian basis is implicit (since tensor components are being integrated). The metric is used to raise
and lower indices, e.g. for a vector vi = gijvj and vi = gijvj, where the inverse metric gij satisﬁes gjkgki = δj
i and δj
i
is the Kronecker-delta tensor. When integrating over volumes, the measure is given by dV = √gd3x where g is the
i that is compatible
determinant of the metric. Finally, all spatial derivatives are given by the covariant derivative
with the metric (i.e.

igjk = 0).

Let mx denote the “particle” mass of the xth-constituent, so that ρx = mxnx is the mass density of that same

Worth noting at this point is that we will consider the entropy to be a ﬂuid, the main distinction being that its mass
is zero.
Its “number” density is simply the entropy per unit volume, and it is assumed to satisfy a creation rule like
Eq. (6).

B. Conservation of Linear Momentum

Let px

given by

i represent the (local) linear momentum per ﬂuid element (which will later be understood to be canonically
x) of the xth-constituent. The total (local) linear momentum of the ﬂuid pi will then obviously be

Likewise let πi denote the total linear momentum density, so that

The total (global) linear momentum Pi of the ﬂuid contained in the control volume will be given by

Finally, let T j
i represent the ith-component of the total linear momentum that ﬂows (per unit time and unit area)
in a direction perpendicular to the jth-direction, and let fi be the net external force density acting on the control
volume. Overall conservation of linear momentum in V is then given by

Here we could have added a term that corresponds to the net internal forces. However, the weak law of action and
reaction implies that this contribution is zero [41]. There are also the well-known diﬃculties for action and reaction
when charged particles are present (cf. [41]).

The individual ﬂuid components will not satisfy exactly the same conservation law, since momentum and energy
can be exchanged between them. However, it is worthwhile to assume that the xth-constituent satisﬁes an equation
of the form

noting that this is still completely general, as nothing has been proposed about either T xj
i . That being said,
one should not be too surprised by such a choice, since it represents the limiting form familiar from single-ﬂuid studies.

D. Conservation of Angular Momentum

In order to get an appropriate deﬁnition of the total angular momentum Li in the control volume, let us ﬁrst
reconsider the total linear momentum Pi in the context of Newton’s Second Law. We need to determine those
internal and external contributions that act within the ﬂuid to change Pi, so as to properly deﬁne the net torque.

Referring back to Eq. (10), we can use Pi in Newton’s Second Law to determine the net “force” Fi acting on the

control volume:

which is the desired result. Of course, Eq. (21) implies that the total angular momentum contained within the
control volume is conserved when the net torque vanishes. We can use this to our advantage now, by showing that
conservation results only if the symmetry Tij = Tji holds.

When a system is completely isolated, and the control volume is such that it completely contains the system and
has a boundary taken well outside the system, we should ﬁnd that Li is conserved, i.e. constant in time, if in addition
the net force fi acting is zero. Eq. (21) can be rewritten as

The ﬁrst term on the right vanishes because the net force fi is zero. The last term vanishes because we have taken
the boundary of the control volume well outside the system. Hence, if angular momentum is to be conserved, the
middle term must also vanish, which implies Tij = Tji.

Because of the inherent linearity in our deﬁnitions when summing over the constituent indices, we immediately see

that an appropriate deﬁnition for the control volume force F x

Minimizing the action associated with
in the usual way will necessarily lead to the conservative Euler-Lagrange
equations. To incorporate dissipation, we use Lagrange’s generalized approach (which is championed by Carter, see
for example [30]), which is to obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations in the usual way, but instead of equating them
to zero we put them equal to an appropriate sum of generalized forces that may include dissipation. The net eﬀect
is that the Lagrangian serves to deﬁne the momenta, whose identiﬁcation is perhaps the most crucial element of the
multi-ﬂuid construction that fully incorporates entrainment.

We will now establish that Ψ enters the total momentum conservation equation as a generalized pressure. To do this

Widely discussed in the general relativity literature (for instance, Ref. [42]), is the fact that the stress-energy-
momentum tensor can be obtained from a variation of the Lagrangian with respect to the metric.
It is natural
that metric variations are associated with stresses, since stress leads to deformations and the metric is what gives

with respect to gij (see [2] for a rigorous
derivation). Our variation is to be understood as a displacement, in a small amount of time, of each ﬂuid element
within a ﬁxed control volume, keeping the individual particle numbers and their associated velocities ﬁxed.

This is manifestly Galilean invariant and locally isotropic.
It is worth pointing out that this is not the most general
form for the energy that we can allow. For example, it would be straightforward to include an explicit dependence
on the vorticity, eg. in terms of the “vorticity” vector W i
xs (deﬁned below by Eq. (60)) we could allow the energy to
depend on W 2
xs. This would be analogous to the superﬂuid Helium model discussed by Bekarevich and
Khalatnikov [43] where the circulation around a vortex contributes to the energy budget, and would lead to terms
that could be interpreted as the “vortex tension”. Although one can think of other such possibilities we prefer to
work with Eq. (36) here. Once the complete framework has been developed for this case, it should be relatively easy
to extend it to include more general cases.

At this point it is important to note that, since the pressure Ψ is not generally separable there is in general no way to
write T j

which is examined in more detail in Appendix B. Basically, it is more natural to work with the individual chemical
potentials. Then the ﬁnal equations retain the natural symmetry between diﬀerent chemical constituents.

III. THE ONSAGER FORMULATION FOR DISSIPATIVE MULTI-FLUIDS

Because we have many independent ﬂuids, the number of potential dissipation coeﬃcients can be quite large.
However, Onsager [1] demonstrated long ago that microscopic reversibility implies certain equalities among “oﬀ-
diagonal” pieces of the entropy creation rate.
Since this argument plays a key role in our analysis it is worth
outlining the main ideas. A more detailed, pedagogical, description can be found in [44].

We begin by noting that the entropy, here represented by the number density ns = s, is maximal for a system
in equilibrium. This means that any perturbation away from the equilibrium must be represented by quadratic
deviations. Speciﬁcally, in the “thermal frame” associated with the entropy velocity vi
s, the conservation law Eq. (6)
implies

Comparing this to the anticipated expansion, see Jaynes [45] for an elegant exposition of this, near an equilibrium

we can identify [46]

where the N individual Xa are known as “thermodynamic forces” and the J a as “ﬂuxes.” The thermodynamic forces
represent a measure of the departure from global equilibrium in the system, with the ﬂuxes arising in response. The
Onsager symmetry principle simply states that Lab = Lba.

Let us now see how we can apply this idea to our formalism. Our entropy creation rate is obtained from Eq. (47),

by solving for Γs. Noting that the chemical potentials µx, which are obtained from

The tensorial aspects of the “L” and “ ˜L” coeﬃcients are handled by assuming that they can only be constructed
from combinations of the thermodynamic forces, µx, wi
xs, and the background geometry terms, i.e. the
xs and
metric gij and the volume form ǫijk = √g[ijk], where [ijk] is completely antisymmetric with [123] = 1. Moreover,
in keeping with the spirit of the Onsager expansion and due to the fact that we are supposedly close to equilibrium,
we consider only those terms that lead to quadratic combinations of the thermodynamic forces in Γs. With these
restrictions it is clear one would not expect coupling between forces with diﬀerent tensorial nature. We readily ﬁnd
that ˜Lxy
i = 0 and that we can rule out the use of wi
xs in any of the coeﬃcients. The most general
coeﬃcients within our assumptions that can be written are

Clearly, each coeﬃcient inherits for its spatial indices the symmetries of either gij or ǫijk. There has also been a

Here we should emphasize that the proper deﬁnition of vorticity, for which one recovers the Kelvin-Helmholtz con-
servation theorem, is in terms of the momentum [2, 20]. In the absence of entrainment the quantity we use and the
conserved vorticity are identical; but when entrainment is present, the diﬀerence is crucial.
In terms of the analysis
presented here, our introduction of the “vorticity” is purely a matter of convenience, as it helps in separating purely
symmetric (in the spatial indices) from antisymmetric objects.

It is easy to show, given the explicit transformations in [2] that the chemical potentials are Galilean invariant. Since
all other terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (65) depend only on velocity diﬀerences we see that the entire expression
is invariant. This is, of course, as it should be. After all, the diﬀerence between reversible (T Γs = 0) and irreversible
(T Γs > 0) processes cannot depend on the observer.

There are several diﬀerent strategies to adopt in demonstrating the positive-deﬁnite nature of Γs. Common to all
is the simple notion of producing terms that look like V T M V , where M is a d
d symmetric matrix, and V is a
d-dimensional vector. At that point basic theorems from linear algebra (cf. [47]) can be employed that will yield the
constraints under which the matrix coeﬃcients lead to positive-deﬁnite quantities. In our case, the most natural way
to gather together terms is to introduce two new vectors (in this linear algebra sense):

IV. THE NEUTRON, PROTON, ELECTRON AND ENTROPY SYSTEM

A. The problem of neutron star dissipation

At zero temperature, the outer core of a neutron star consists of three interpenetrating ﬂuids: superﬂuid neutrons,
superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate gas of normal ﬂuid electrons. Because of electromagnetic coupling
the charged components lock together on a timescale that is much shorter than, eg., the timescale of stellar rotation
or oscillation. Hence, the problem usually reduces to a two-ﬂuid system. At a ﬁnite temperature, the situation is
considerably more complex. Most obviously, we need to account also for the entropy. Provided that the system is
far below the various superﬂuid transition temperatures, the entropy is associated with the electrons. However, there
will also be contributions from excitations of the neutron and proton condensates. Accounting for these requires
more thought. Based on the studies of the analogous problem for superﬂuid Helium there would seem to be (at least)
two possible strategies. The diﬀerence between them is nicely described by Geurst [9].

In the ﬁrst approach, championed by Carter and his collaborators (see for example [2]), each superﬂuid component
In our formalism this would amount to associating

an entropy component to both the neutrons and the protons.
It is then not diﬃcult to show that the “normal ﬂuid
density” associated with the the xth-constituent is directly proportional to the entrainment coeﬃcient αxs (cf. [2]). In
principle, both the neutrons and the protons will thus contribute to the normal ﬂuid. This eﬀect becomes particularly
important near the superﬂuid transition temperatures. Far below the transition temperature, the temperature is
essentially zero and one would expect both αns and αps to be eﬀectively zero. Anyway, in order to account for a
“normal” part of each superﬂuid we need to begin with a four-ﬂuid system. Otherwise there would be no explicit
distinction between the entrainment coeﬃcients, eg. between those that couple the ﬂuids to the entropy, and those
(i.e. αnp, αne, and αpe) that couple the species of particles to each other. As the electrons are not superconducting,
we can assume that vi

s which means that we can set αes = 0.

e = vi

The second possibility is perhaps closer to the orthodox approach to superﬂuids [9, 26], in which one introduces an
ad hoc separation of the mass density into a “superﬂuid” density and a “normal” ﬂuid density.
In our framework,
this would involve dividing each density nx into a piece associated with the condensate and a piece corresponding
to the quasiparticle excitations. This philosophy was used in the recent calculation of entrainment parameters by
Gusakov and Haensel [48].

At the end of the day, the separation of a ﬂuid constituent into two pieces is purely formal. One could not
conceivably separate the superﬂuid condensate from the excitations in a real physical system. The mathematical
formalism that we have developed should be ﬂexible enough to allow us to represent both approaches to the ﬁnite
temperature problem. As we will discuss elsewhere, the main issue concerns the interpretation of the various variables
(especially the entrainment coeﬃcients).

It should also be noted that, despite neutron stars being self-gravitating bodies, we will not couple gravity to our
In the Newtonian context this is easily done by introducing an external force [2]. We do not

model at this point.
include this force here as our main focus is on the ﬂuid aspects of the problem.

Let us proceed by assuming that there are four independent densities, eg. the number densities for the neutrons,
protons, and electrons, as well as the entropy density. These are denoted (nn, np, ne, s). A priori, the system will
consist of four independent velocities, eg. the neutron, proton, electron and entropy velocities which are denoted
(vi
s). The entropy ﬂuid is massless. We consider the four-ﬂuid system ﬁrst, in order to identify all the
entrainment coeﬃcients, before reducing to the case where all “normal” ﬂuids ﬂow together. We believe that this
strategy is more natural than one which imposes the existence of only two distinct transport velocities from the
beginning.

This expression shows that the problem is extremely rich. Our system has in general 19 independent dissipation
coeﬃcients. This can be compared to the general case for superﬂuid Helium which, according to Putterman [39],
requires 13 independent coeﬃcients.

In principle, it is now a straightforward matter to determine the constraints on the dissipation coeﬃcients, since
each deﬁning matrix is symmetric and real, and thus linear-algebra theorems can be employed to determine when
each contribution is positive deﬁnite, speciﬁcally, if all the eigenvalues of the deﬁning matrix are positive then the
quadratic form will be positive deﬁnite. For example, it is not diﬃcult to show that if both ηnn and ηcc are negative
then there are no values for the coeﬃcients that will lead to a positive-deﬁnite form. On the other hand, if ηnn
0
and ηcc

0, then the quadratic form is positive if and only if

≥

≥

ηnnηcc > (ηnc)2 .

A similar analysis for the second and third matrices would be tractable analytically, since the characteristic equations
for the eigenvalues will be third and fourth order, respectively. However, it is not clear that working out the detailed
conditions would add any further insight at the present time. After all, many of the coeﬃcients in our general
expression are new, and it may be more productive to begin by seeing if we can interpret their physical meaning.

B. Final reduction: The two-ﬂuid equations

In order to connect with previous work on superﬂuid neutron stars we conclude our discussion by making one
further reduction. We will neglect heat conduction and let the entropy ﬂow with the charged ﬂuid components. This
simply means that we take vi
c in all equations in the previous section. This implies that we only have two
independent velocities in the problem, and hence only need two equations of motion. Given this, it is natural to
combine the momenta of the entropy and the charged components and consider

It is instructive to consider the above equations of motion in the context of what we already know about dissipative
ﬂuids.
In particular, we would like to understand which of our many coeﬃcients can be considered as known, and
which represent potentially new aspects of the problem. To carry out this exercise, let us begin on familiar territory
and consider the total dissipation part. From our deﬁnitions, we have

Not surprisingly, the interior coupling terms are not as straightforward to explain. This is quite obvious since we
have tried to write down a more or less general expression for the permissible terms in a multi-ﬂuid context where
previous studies have been limited. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the bulk of the extant work was
carried out in the “orthodox” framework [26]. To interpret the result, we consider the combination

orthogonally to the relative ﬂow [20]. The two terms involving Θnc and Θnc
ij are simply analogues of the standard
bulk- and shear-viscosities, although here it is the expansion and shear of the relative ﬂow which is important. The
coeﬃcient τ nn accounts for eﬀects due to the ﬂuids being driven out of chemical equilibrium by the ﬂow.
In recent
work Carter and collaborators have refered to this type of interaction as “transfusion”. The ﬁnal term in Eq. (108),

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have described a general formalism which can be used to model dissipative multi-ﬂuid systems. Our discussion
was based on the key conservation laws for mass, energy and linear and angular momentum, together with recent
progress in deriving the equations of motion for the non-dissipative problem from a variational principle [2–5], and
the classic Onsager symmetry principle which provides a strategy for including dissipative terms in such a way that
the second law of thermodynamics is satisﬁed. Following this approach, we derived a set of multi-ﬂuid equations
which has a number of advantages over the “standard” formalism used to model, in particular, superﬂuid He4. The
most important diﬀerence is that we have made due distinction between velocities and momenta, which means that
the entrainment eﬀect is accounted for in a natural way.

As an application of the general formalism, we considered two models for a neutron star core. The ﬁrst model
accounts for three distinct ﬂuids, the superﬂuid neutrons, a conglomerate of charged particles (protons and electrons)
and the entropy. We have shown that this model, in principle, requires 19 distinct dissipation coeﬃcients to be
determined. Detailed microscopic analysis is needed to understand the relevance of the majority of these coeﬃcients.
We also discussed how the normal ﬂuid fraction of neutrons that should be present at ﬁnite temperatures can be
associated with the entrainment parameter αns which encodes how the equation of state depends on the relative
motion between the neutrons and the entropy. Our second model is obtained by neglecting heat conductivity. This
couples the entropy to the charged ﬂuid and reduces the number of independent degrees of freedom to two. We
discussed the form of the various dissipative terms in this two-ﬂuid model, and interpreted their physical meaning.
We also showed how the mutual friction, which is mediated by the superﬂuid vortices, can be accounted for within
our model.

One can envisage a number of interesting applications of the framework that we have developed in this paper.
In
the case of neutron stars, the possibilities range from the viscous damping of neutron star oscillations due to electron-
electron scattering [19] to intricate issues concerning the eﬀect of entrainment on the mutual friction force [20]. Since
our model allows for much more complicated multi-ﬂuid dynamics than has so far been considered in the literature, one
would have to be somewhat suspicious about any statements about the damping of superﬂuid neutron star oscillations
which were made without consideration of the various degrees of freedom.
It would certainly be interesting to revisit
the problem of oscillation modes driven unstable by gravitational radiation [11] and investigate the role of the true
multi-ﬂuid degrees of freedom. Our hope is this work will inspire a signiﬁcant improvement of our understanding
of superﬂuid neutron star dynamics, and perhaps generate input from other communities (eg. chemistry) that have
much experience with multi-ﬂuid systems.

Finally, it is worth emphasising that our formalism is quite general, and one would expect it to be useful also
in other problem areas. Applying it to other multi-phase ﬂow problems, as discussed in for example [6–8], seems
relatively straightforward. There are also more exotic possibilities. In particular, we believe that our formalism could
be quite relevant for problems involving ﬂuid analogues of various curved spacetimes, such as black holes and big-bang
cosmologies, that can be potentially observable in laboratory systems (see [51] for a discussion of “sonic” horizons in
superﬂuids, and [52] for a recent review). For this kind of application, it would be particularly important to establish
whether the “spacetime” eﬀects are likely to be rendered experimentally undetectable by various forms of dissipation.

Here we will motivate why the conservative part of the total stress tensor Cj

i can be obtained from a variation of
the action with respect to the metric. The analysis is by no means rigorous, but it does lead to the result that has
been obtained rigorously in Ref. [2]. Our aim is to give the reader not familiar with all aspects of action-based ﬁeld
theory some basic physical intuition, using simple energy conservation arguments.

Let us consider a displacement δξi, in a small amount of time δt = t2

t1 of a closed, isolated system such that the
individual constituent particle numbers as well as their corresponding velocities are kept ﬁxed. We will also suppose
that each constituent undergoes the same displacement so that their respective velocities can be written

.

Because the system is closed and isolated, the total energy will be conserved. From Eqs. (15) and (28) the change in
total energy can be written

where the last term represents the diﬀerence in the integral before (at time t1) and after (at time t2) the displacement
is put in place.
If we now impose that the total energy does not change δU = 0, and that the velocities remain ﬁxed,
i.e. ∂vi

x/∂t = 0, then upon insertion of Eq. (13) we ﬁnd

where the second equality follows because the displacement is the same for each constituent, we have used Eq. (14),
and we have kept only terms linear in δξi. Since the system is isolated, the net force fi = 0. Finally, after integrating
by parts, we can write

The last term will vanish if we impose suitable boundary conditions on the control volume (or assume that the
boundary is well outside the ﬂuids).

We now need to establish that the deformation of the system set up by the displacement δξi induces a change in
the metric, which in fact will deﬁne the δ variation in Eq. (116). Consider an active coordinate transformation where
the metric is pushed (at time t2) to the new points xi = xi + δξi. Denoting the transformed metric as gij, then
ordinary tensor analysis implies

Next we deﬁne

Thus in Eq. (116) we can rewrite the displacement on the right-hand side in terms of δgij .

Next we must determine how to vary the fundamental variables nx and ni

x under the displacement. Recall that we

are assuming that the number of xth-constituent particles Nx remains ﬁxed. This implies

where matrix theory (cf. [47]) can be used to show

Thus, using also Eq. (119), we know how the displacement changes nx. Furthermore, we also know how the particle
number density currents ni

we have

x, but the velocities remain ﬁxed, and so δni

x change since ni

x = nxvi

x = vi

The small variation indicated on the left-hand side of Eq. (116) is the diﬀerence between the integral before the
displacement and the integral after the displacement. But as the integral is a function only of nx, ni
x, and gij, and
the variations δnx and δni
x induced by the displacement are equivalent to a variation of the metric, we see that the
δ on the left-hand side of Eq. (116) can be equally understood as a variation of the metric. Thus, Eq. (116) can be
reduced to

Finally, using the less-general internal energy given in Eq. (36) we ﬁnd

which is Eq. (38) in the main body of the paper.

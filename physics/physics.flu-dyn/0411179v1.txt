Abstract

We consider joint probability distributions for the class of coupled Langevin equations introduced

by Fogedby [H.C. Fogedby, Phys. Rev. E 50, 1657 (1994)]. We generalize well-known results for

the single time probability distributions to the case of N-time joint probability distributions. It is

shown that these probability distribution functions can be obtained by an integral transform from

distributions of a Markovian process. The integral kernel obeys a partial diﬀerential equation with

fractional time derivatives reﬂecting the non-Markovian character of the process.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the connections between ”continuous time random walk” (CTRW), which

originated in the work of Montroll and Weiss [1] generalizing the idea of Brownian random

walks, and fractional Fokker-Planck equations have been established. For a review we refer

the reader to [2]. The solutions of these equations exhibit both super- and subdiﬀusive be-

haviour and are thus appropriate models for a large variety of transport processes in complex

systems [4]. Recently, a connection between the velocity increment statistics of a Lagrangian

tracer particle in fully developed turbulent ﬂows and a type of CTRW has been introduced

[5]. Here, a closure assumption on a hierarchy of joint velocity-position pdf’s derived from a

statistical formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation leads to a generalization of Oboukhov’s

random walk model [6] in terms of a continous time random walk. It allows for a successful

parametrization of the single time probability distributions of velocity increments. How-

ever, there are diﬀerent suggestions for the stochastic process of Lagrangian particles in

turbulence, which are able to provide reasonable approximations for the single time velocity

increment statistics. This example evidences that one has to introduce further quantities in

order to distinguish between diﬀerent stochastic models.

For non-Markovian processes, the natural extension is the consideration of N-times joint

probability distributions. It seems that for the class of CTRWs only single time probability

distributions have been investigated so far. In that case fractional diﬀusion equations of the

form

∂
∂t

f (x, t) = 0D1−α

can be derived. Here x denotes the random variable, L is a Fokker-Planck operator (for dif-
fusion processes L = ∂2

is the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀerential operator

∂x2 ) and 0D1−α

(c.f. appendix A). The properties of this equation with regard to physical applications have

been extensively discussed in the recent reviews [2], [3]. In [7] Fogedby introduced a class

of coupled Langevin equations, where he also considered a case which leads to an operator
L including fractional derivatives with respect to the variable x, L = ∂β

∂xβ . A similar case
[8], who made an extension to several dimensions

has been studied by Meerschaert et al.

introducing a multidimensional generalization of fractional diﬀusion, so-called operator L´evy

motion. This allows for a description of anomalous diﬀusion with direction dependent Hurst

indices Hi deﬁned by the relation < (xi(t) − xi(t = 0))2 >≈ t2Hi. In [9] limit theorems of a

2

class of continuous time random walks with inﬁnite mean waiting times have been investi-

gated. It is shown that the limit process obeys a fractional Cauchy problem. The emphasis

again is put on single time distributions.

The purpose of the present paper is to investigate multiple time probability distribution

functions for the class of coupled Langevin equations introduced by Fogedby [7], which

have been considered to be a representation of a continuous time random walk.

The paper is outlined as follows.

In the next section we present the coupled Langevin

equations considered by Fogedby [7] consisting of a usual Langevin process X(s) in a

coordinate s and a L´evy process representing a stochastic relation t(s). One is interested
in the process X(t) = X(s−1(t)). Fogedby [7] investigated the case where the processes

X(s) and t(s) are statistically independent and showed how fractional diﬀusion equations

of the form (1) arise. Interesting results for the case where the processes are statistically

dependent have been considered by Becker-Kern et al. [10] leading to generalizations of the

fractional diﬀusion equations (1). However, both publications are devoted to single time

probability distributions.

In section II we present a central formula, which relates the N-times probability distri-

butions of X(t) to the pdf’s of X(s) via an integral transform, which is determined by the

process t(s). In section III properties of the involved L´evy-stable process t(s) are considered

leading to expressions for the pdf of the inverse process s(t). In section V we specify the

moments for the case of a simple diﬀusion process.

II. A CLASS OF NON-MARKOVIAN PROCESSES

Starting point of our discussion is the set of coupled Langevin equations [7] for the motion

of a Brownian particle in an external force ﬁeld F in d=1 dimensions (an extension to higher

dimensions d > 1 is straightforward):

In this framework the random walk is parametrized in terms of the continuous path vari-

.

able s, which may be considered eg. as arc length along the trajectory. X(s) and t(s) denote

the position and time in physical space. The random variables η(s) and τ (s) are responsible

for the stochastic character of the process. We are only considering the case of uncoupled

jump lengths and waiting times such that η and τ are statistically independent (coupled

CTRWs have been considered in [10]). The arc lenght is related to physical time t by the
inverse function s = t−1(t) = s(t). Thus, we have to assume τ (s) > 0. We are interested in

the process X(s(t)), i.e. the behaviour of the variable X as a function of physical time t.

For the characterization of the process we introduce the two-times probability density func-

tions (pdf) for the processes (2), (3):

f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) = < δ(x2 − X(s2))δ(x1 − X(s1)) >

,

p(t2, s2; t1, s1) = < δ(t2 − t(s2))δ(t1 − t(s1)) >

,

f (x2, t2; x1, t1) = < δ(x2 − X(s(t2)))δ(x1 − X(s(t1))) >

.

(4)

(5)

(6)

Here the brackets < .. > denote a suitable average over stochastic realizations. For the

sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to n = 2. The generalization to multiple times is

obvious. Both probability functions are determined by the statistics of the independent

random variables η and τ .

A. The process X(s)

We consider the case where η(s) is the standard Langevin force, i.e. η is a Wiener

process. In turn (2) becomes Markovian and f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) can be determined by solving

the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for the conditional probability distribution

P (x2, s2 | x1, s1):

∂
∂s

P (x2, s2 | x1, s1) =

F (x) +

∂
∂x

−

 

∂2
∂x2 !

= LF P (x)P (x2, s2 | x1, s1)

.

(7)

The diﬀusion constant is set to 1 in the following. Due to the Markovian property of the

process X(s) the joint pdf is obtained by multiplication with the single time pdf according

to

f1(x2, s2; x1, s1) = P (x2, s2 | x1, s1)f (x1, s1)

.

(8)

For a general treatment of the FPE we refer the reader to the monographs of Risken [11]

and Gardiner [12].

B. The process t(s)

The stochastic process t(s) is determined by the properties of τ (s). The corresponding

pdf’s are denoted by p(t, s), p(t2, s2; t1, s1). Furthermore, we shall consider τ (s) to be a

(one-sided) L´evy-stable process of order α [7], [17] with 0 < α < 1. As a result, the process

t(s) is Markovian. L´evy-stable processes of this kind induce the property of a diverging

characteristic waiting time < t(s) > . Consequently the stochastic process in physical time

t, given by the coupling of the Langevin equations (2) and (3) reveals subdiﬀusive behaviour.

The speciﬁc form of p(t2, s2; t1, s1) will be given below.

For a deeper discussion we refer to the review articles [2], [3], [4] where the general relation

between subdiﬀusive behaviour and diverging waiting times has been treated in detail.

C. The process X(t) = X(s(t))

We are interested in the properties of the variable X with respect to the physical time t.

Therefore, we have to consider the inverse of the stochastic process t = t(s):

s = t−1(t) = s(t)

.

(9)

The stochastic process X(s(t)) then is described by the joint probability distribution

f (x2, t2; x1, t1) =< δ(x2 − X(s2))δ(s2 − s(t2))δ(x1 − X(s1))δ(s1 − s(t1)) >

.

(10)

The N-point distributions are determined in a similar way.

Introducing the probability

distribution h for the inverse process s(t),

h(s, t) = < δ(s − s(t)) >

,

h(s2, t2; s1, t1) = < δ(s2 − s(t2))δ(s1 − s(t1)) >

,

(11)

we can calculate the pdf of the process X(t) = X(s(t)) as a function of the physical time

by eliminating the path variables si:

f (x2, t2; x1, t1) =

ds1

ds2 h(s2, t2; s1, t1)f1(x2, s2; x1, s1)

.

(12)

∞

0

This relationship is due to the fact that the processes X(s) and t(s) are statistically in-

dependent.

In that case, the expectation values in (10) factorize. Equation (12) can be

generalized to N times. In fact, one may turn over to a path integral representation:

f (x(t)) =

Ds(t)h(s(t))f1(x(s(t)))

.

(13)

Z

However, we do not investigate this path integral further.

The probability distribution h can be determined with the help of the cumulative

distribution function of s(t).

Since the process t(s) has the property (for s > 0)

s2 > s1 → t(s2) > t(s1), one has the relationship

Θ(s − s(t)) = 1 − Θ(t − t(s))

.

(14)

Here, we have introduced the Heaviside step function: Θ(x) = 1 for x > 0 and Θ(x) = 0

for x < 0, Θ(x = 0) = 1/2. The validity of eq.(14) becomes evident from an inspection of

ﬁg. 1: The function Θ(s − s(t)) equals one in the region above the curve t = t(s), whereas

Θ(t − t(s) equals one in the region below the curve t = t(s). On the curve Θ(s − s(t)) =

1/2 = Θ(t − t(s)).

An immediate consequence is the following connection among the cumulative distribution

functions of the processes t(s) and s(t):

< Θ(s − s(t)) > = 1− < Θ(t − t(s)) >

,

< Θ(s2 − s(t2))Θ(s1 − s(t1) > = < (1 − Θ(t2 − t(s2)))(1 − Θ(t1 − t(s1))) >

= 1− < Θ(t2 − t(s2)) > − < Θ(t1 − t(s1)) >

+ < Θ(t2 − t(s2))Θ(t1 − t(s1) >

.

(15)

Simple diﬀerentiation of eq.(15) yields the probability density function h of the process s(t):

h(s, t) = −

< Θ(t − t(s)) >

,

∂
∂s
∂
∂s1

∂
∂s2

h(s2, t2; s1, t1) =

< Θ(t2 − t(s2))Θ(t1 − t(s1)) >

.

(16)

Furthermore, since for t = 0 we have the correspondence s = 0, the usual boundary condi-

tions hold:

h(s, 0) = δ(s)

,

6

h(s2, t2; s1, 0) = h(s2, t2)δ(s1)

,

h(s2, t2 → t1; s1, t1) = δ(s2 − s1)h(s1, t1)

,

(17)

and can be veriﬁed from eq.(16).

III. DETERMINATION OF THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS p(s, t):

L´EVY-STABLE PROCESSES

In the following we shall consider the joint multiple times pdf of the L´evy-stable process

(3) of order α. Simple integration of (3) yields

t(si) =

where we assume τ (s) > 0. Additionally, we consider the characteristic function for ω = iλ.

It will become clear below that working with Laplace transforms is more convenient for

manipulating the pdf’s of process (3) in the present context.

A. One-sided L´evy-stable processes: Single time

At this point we have to introduce speciﬁc properties of the L´evy-stable process. L´evy

distributions Lα,β(x) are deﬁned by two parameters [13], [16]: α characterizes the asymptotic

behaviour of the stable distribution for large x and hence the critical order of diverging

moments. β characterizes the asymmetry. In the present case τ > 0 and the distribution is

maximally asymmetric p(t < 0, s) = 0. This leads to β = 1. In the following we denote the

L´evy distribution Lα,β(x) for β = 1 by Lα(x).

teristic function, which we write in the form:

Let us motivate the consideration of L´evy statistics. To this end we consider the charac-

Z(λ, s) = < e

(20)

where α is a certain parameter. The choice Z(λ, s) = ˜Z(λαs) leads to a scale invariant pdf
p(t, s) = 1/s1/αP ( t

s1/α ) [8].

7

As a result, the characteristic function takes the form

Z(λ, s) = e−λαs

,

where we assume 0 < α < 1.

The probability distribution then becomes

p(t, s) =

1
s1/α Lα(

t
s1/α )

,

(21)

(22)

where Lα(t) denotes the one sided L´evy stable distribution whose Laplace transform is
L{Lα(t)} = e−λα.

B. Multiple times

The joint pdf of the Levy process t(s) has been introduced in eq.(5). Starting with this

deﬁnition the derivation of the explicit expression for the pdf is straightforward and clearly

reveals the Markovian character of this process. The characteristic function is given as

Laplace transform of eq.(5):

(23)

For further evaluating this expression we have to distinguish between the cases s2 > s1 and

s1 > s2. With a given ordering of s2, s1 we can rearrange the integrals and write Z as a sum

of two contributions:

Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) =

Θ(s2 − s1) < e

+ Θ(s1 − s2) < e

Here the expectation values factorize due to statistical independence of the increments τ

+ Θ(s1 − s2)e−s2(λ1+λ2)α

.

(25)

This is the characteristic function of the Levy process for multiple times. The appearance

of the exponents (λ1 + λ2)α is characteristic in this context and carries over to the pdf of

8

the inverse process. We obtain the pdf p(s2, t2; s1, t1) after performing the inverse Laplace

transform of eq.(25). The result is

p(t2, s2; t1, s1) =

Θ(s2 − s1)

This expression explicitly exhibits the Markovian nature of the process. The conditional pdf

p(t2, s2|t1, s1) for s2 > s1 is just:

p(t2, s2|t1, s1) =

1
(s2 − s1)1/α Lα

t2 − t1
(s2 − s1)1/α !

 

.

We remind the reader that Lα(x) = 0 for negative values of x. The expression for the joint

pdf for multiple points is obvious.

. (26)

(27)

IV. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION h(s, t)

The pdf’s h(s, t), h(s2, t2; s1, t1) of the inverse process s = s(t) can be obtained from

the pdf’s of the process t = t(s) with the help of relationship eq.(16). We shall consider

the single- and multiple-time cases separately. Again, due to the simple form of the Levy

distributions in Laplace space, we perform most of the calculations with Laplace transforms.

A. Single time

to t, the relation eq.(16) reads:

Using the notation ˜h(s, λ) = L{h(s, t)} for the Laplace transform of h(s, t) with respect

˜h(s, λ) = −

The derivative with respect to s is easily performed with eq.(21) and leads to the solution

˜h(s, λ):

˜h(s, λ) = λα−1e−sλα

.

(29)

This expression has already been derived in [7] — however without giving a ‘simple physical

argument’. Here the derivation is clearly based on eq.(14) which relates the L´evy-stable

9

process and its inverse.

The inverse Laplace transform of eq.(29) is known and has been calculated in [15]:

Γ(1 + nα)

.

Here we have obtained the pdf of s(t) for single times. Therefore, a complete characteri-

zation of the inverse process is given in this case.

However in order to derive an evolution equation for the pdf of the process X(s(t)) we

require an equation which determines h(s, t).

From eq.(29) it is evident that ˜h(s, λ) obeys the diﬀerential equation

with the initial condition ˜h(0, λ) = λα−1 for s = 0. Hence, Laplace inversion yields a

fractional evolution equation for h(s, t):

(31)

(32)

(33)

B. Multiple times

The statistical characterization of the process s(t) for multiple times has been investigated

from a mathematical point of view in the work of Bingham [18] already in 1971. He derived

the following relationships for the moments < s(tN )...s(t1) >:

∂N
∂t1...∂tN

< s(tN )...s(t1) > =

1

Γ(α)N [t1(t2 − t1)...(tN − tN −1)]α−1

(34)

This equation can be obtained from the previous relation (16), which inferes the following

relationship between the probability densities p(t, s) and h(s, t):

∂sN ...∂s1

In the following we shall derive explicit expressions for these moments and show

that instead of (34) fractional equations can be used for their determination. Based

on eq.(16) and eq.(25) the derivation of an expression for the Laplace transform
˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) := L{h(s2, t2; s1, t1)} is obtained in a way analogous to the single-time case.

We start by considering eq.(16) in Laplace-space:

˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) =

(36)

Using eq.(25) we can perform the derivatives of Z(λ2, s2; λ1, s1) with respect to s1, s2:

˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) =

δ(s2 − s1)

. (37)

As a result we have obtained the Laplace transform of the joint pdf h(s2, t2; s1, t1). Unfor-

tunately, a closed form of the inverse Laplace transform could not be calculated. The given
solution ˜h can be readily used however to derive meaningful expressions which characterize

the inverse process s(t).

1. Moments of the inverse process

In order to obtain further information about the process s(t) for multiple times we cal-

culate the moments of the pdf. Let us ﬁrst demonstrate how this can be achieved for the

simple case < s(t1)s(t2) >. This moment is deﬁned from the pdf h(s2, t2; s1, t1) as:

< s(t1)s(t2) > =

Using this fractional diﬀerential operator, we are in the position to write down a simple

recursion relation for arbitrary moments of h({si, ti}). The second moment eq.(39) reads:

The third moment is obtained via fractional integration of the sum of second order moments.

to n times of the sum of all permutations of n − 1 order moments.

This equation can also be derived directly from ˜h(s, λ). Thus one can obtain a complete

characterization of the process s(t) based on eq.(37) or eq.(36) respectively. Below, we shall

show how to obtain these results on the basis of an evolution equation for the multipoint

pdf h(s1, t1; ...; sN , tN ).

From eq.(16) one can derive the general form of the pdf h of the inverse process s(t). The

two times pdf reads (here we assume the case s2 > s1 for simplicity)

h(s2, t2; s1, t1) =

dt′

2 p(t′

2 − t′

1, s2 − s1) p(t′

1, s1)

1 h(s2 − s1, t2 − t′

1) p(t′

.

(51)

We deﬁne

H(s2 − s1, t2 − t1; s1 − s0, t1 − t0) = −

dt′

1 h(s2 − s1, t2 − t′

1) p(t′

1 − t0, s1 − s0). (52)

The form of the three times pdf is obtained in the same way and reads for s3 > s2 > s1:

h(s3, t3; s2, t2; s1, t1) =

dt′

2 h(s3 − s2, t3 − t′

with a straightforward extension to the general case.

With the help of eq.(52) this expression can be represented according to

The integrals cannot simply be evaluated and the relations are formal. However, they show

the underlying mathematical structure of the statistical description of the inverse process

s(t).

3. Fractional evolution equation

In analogy to the single time case, where we have speciﬁed a fractional diﬀerential equa-

tion for h(s, t), we now establish an evolution equation for h(s2, t2; s1, t1).

From eq.(37) it is evident that the following equation holds:

∂
∂s1

 

+

∂
∂s2 !

˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1) = −(λ1 + λ2)α˜h(s2, λ2; s1, λ1)

(56)

14

with initial conditions

˜h(0, λ2; 0, λ1) =

˜h(s2, λ2; 0, λ1) =

˜h(0, λ2; s1, λ1) =

(57)

A common way to solve ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equations is the method of charac-

teristics. Applying this method to eq.(56) with the given initial condition for each case ,

one obtains the correct expressions eq.(37). Therefore eq.(56) determines the pdf in Laplace

space.

Consequently, upon performing the inverse Laplace transform, we derive that h(s2, t2; s1, t1)

obeys the fractional evolution equation

Again we want to emphasize that this single evolution equation with the proper initial con-

dition suﬃciently assets the pdf for multiple times.

The above equation may also be used to calculate the moments < s(tN )...s(t1) >, which al-

ready have been speciﬁed above. The fractional evolution equation (59) inferes the following

relationship among the moments < s(tN )...s(t1) >:

< s(tN )...s(t1) > =

{< s(tN −1)...s(t1) > +P ermut}

Similarly, we may calculate the moment < x(t2)2x(t1)2 >:

< x(s2)2x(s1)2 > = s2s1 + 2Θ(s2 − s1)s2

< x(t2)2x(t1)2 > = < s(t2)s(t1) > +2Θ(t2 − t1) < s(t1)2 > +2Θ(t1 − t2) < s(t2)2 > . (67)

For the evaluation of < x(s2)2mx(s1)2n > we may use the properties of the moments of

Gaussian processes which read for n > m:

< x(s2)2mx(s1)2n > = Asm

(68)

The coeﬃcients A, B, C can be evaluated by an application of Wick’s theorem for Gaussian

The corresponding expression for the process X(t) becomes accordingly:

< x(t2)2mx(t1)2n > = A < s(t2)ms(t1)n > +BΘ(t2 − t1) < s(t1)n−ms(t2)m >
+BΘ(t1 − t2) < s(t2)n−ms(t1)m >

.

(69)

The calculation of the expectation values < s(t2)2ms(t1)2n > has been discussed above.

VI. CONCLUSION

Up to now the discussion of continuous time random walks and the corresponding

fractional kinetic equations has been focused on single time probability distributions

only. On the basis of this pdf scaling behaviour of moments have been compared with

experiments. However, more information has to be used in order to assign a deﬁnite

stochastic process to a non-Markovian process. To this end we have considered multiple

times pdf for a certain class of stochastic processes.

Our approach is based on the framework of coupled Langevin equations (2),(3) devised

by Fogedby as a realization of a continuous time random walk. Here, the solution for the

N-times pdf’s are given as an integral transform of the pdf’s of an accompanying Markovian

process. We have shown that the non-Markovian character of this process can be traced

back to the properties of the inverse L´evy-stable process.

The next step would be to compare these theoretical predictions with the behaviour of

physical systems which reveal subdiﬀusive behaviour. To our knowledge multiple time

statistics of such systems have not yet been investigated experimentally. This would be of

considerable interest. We may expect that in some cases the consideration of multiple time

statistics may lead to a more precise characterization of the underlying stochastic process.

It is well-known, that for the single time case a fractional diﬀusion equation can be

derived, which determines the pdf f (x, t),

f (x, t) =

We would like to mention that a similar equation can be derived for the multiple times

pdf f (x2, t2; x1, t1). This will be discussed in a future publication. The present article is a

starting point for the investigation of multiple times pdf’s of the coupled Langevin equations

as a solution of

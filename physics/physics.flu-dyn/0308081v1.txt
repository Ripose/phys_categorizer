This work is devoted to the theoretical study of the stability of two superposed horizontal liquid
layers bounded by two solid planes and subjected to a horizontal temperature gradient. The liquids
are supposed to be immiscible with a nondeformable interface. The forces acting on the system
are buoyancy and interfacial tension. Four diﬀerent ﬂow patterns and temperature proﬁles are
found for the basic state. A linear perturbative analysis with respect to two and three dimensional
perturbations reveals the existence of three kind of patterns. Depending on the relative height of
both liquids several situations are predicted: either wave propagation from cold to the hot regions,
or waves propagating in the opposite direction or still stationary longitudinal rolls. The behavior
of three diﬀerent pairs of liquids which have been used in experiments on bilayers under vertical
gradient by other authors have been examined. The instability mechanisms are discussed and a
qualitative interpretation of the diﬀerent behaviors exhibited by the system is provided. In some
conﬁgurations it is possible to ﬁnd a codimension-two point created by the interaction of two Hopf
modes with diﬀerent frequencies and wavenumbers. These results suggest to consider two liquid
layers as an interesting prototype for the study of propagation and interaction of waves in the
context of the B´enard-Marangoni problem.

INTRODUCTION

There has been recently an increasing interest in the study of buoyant-thermocapillary ﬂows induced by horizontal
thermal gradients [1]. Such situations occur in oceanographic currents due to non homogeneous heating, and their
interplay with the atmosphere gives rise to complex meteorological phenomena. They are also important in crystal
growth. The ﬂoating zone process generates thermocapillary convective cells in the region of crystallization which
require better understanding and control.

When a horizontal temperature gradient is acting on a horizontal liquid layer enclosed between two horizontal walls
the problem is much more complicated than in the the more classical case of vertical heating. First, the reference state
is no longer at rest, giving rise to a general ﬂow and a non-linear vertical temperature proﬁle. A non trivial problem
will therefore consist in determining the basic reference temperature and velocity ﬁelds. Another peculiarity is that
the threshold of instability depends on the Prandtl number P r. The problem of thermocapillary instabilities induced
by a lateral heating was ﬁrst studied by Smith and Davis [2]. They predicted the presence of hydrothermal waves and
stationary rolls. More details are provided in a subsequent work by Smith [3], who showed the existence of two diﬀerent
mechanisms of instability depending on P r. At low P r, the energy necessary to sustain the disturbances comes from
the horizontal applied temperature ﬁeld and the hydrothermal waves propagate in a direction perpendicular to the
horizontal temperature gradient. At high P r, the energy is extracted from the vertical temperature ﬁeld by vertical
convection and it gives rise to hydrothermal waves propagating parallel to the temperature gradient. At intermediate
P r, the mechanism is a combination of the previous eﬀects and leads to waves forming an angle with the streamwise
direction. Parmentier et al.
[4] studied the coupling of buoyant and thermocapillary driven instabilities, in the
case of systems with lower and upper insulating bounding surfaces within a 3D linear formulation. Their numerical
results display the three kinds of behavior described above. For thermally conducting surfaces, Gershuni et al.
[5]
ﬁnd stationary rolls for P r > 1. Other theoretical works have mainly focused on comparison with experiments.
Mercier and Normand [6] performed a linear analysis to explain the experimental results by Daviaud and Vince
[7] for a silicon oil with P r = 10. They notice that the transition between traveling waves and stationary rolls
observed when the liquid depth is increased depend on the heat transfer between the liquid and its environment. In

their discussion about absolute, global and convective instabilities Priede and Gerbeth [8] show that the threshold of
absolute instability ﬁts better the experimental data of 1 cSt silicon oil (P r = 13.9) [9] than the value predicted from
convective instability. A non-linear analysis of stability for purely thermocapillary convection has been carried out by
Smith [10], who determines the range of existence of the two oblique traveling waves predicted by the linear theory.
More recently, new results have been reported [11] on hydrothermal waves in diﬀerent geometries, measuring their
frequency, wavenumber and angle of propagation.

In the previous theoretical works it is assumed that the liquid is surmounted by a gas phase above that remains
passive (one-layer approximation). In some cases [6, 8] the eﬀect of the adjacent gas is modelled by a Biot number,
a phenomenological parameter that characterizes the heat transfer between liquid and gas. The Biot number was
originally deﬁned for steady conditions; however when convection takes place, the dynamics of thermal and mechanical
perturbations in the gas may have a strong inﬂuence on the convection inside the liquid. In such a case, the introduction
of a Biot number becomes questionable and the one-layer approximation should be revised. In the general case, a full
two-layer hydrodynamical description is required. Furthermore well controlled experiments involve always two ﬂuid
layers [14]. Such systems are typical of many practical situations as Earth’s mantle convection or encapsulated crystal
growth.

In the past, most theoretical [12] and experimental studies [13]-[16] about Rayleigh-B´enard convection in two
immiscible liquids have been devoted to vertical heating. Only few contributions are found dealing with a horizontal
temperature gradient. To our knowledge the ﬁrst work on the subject is by Villers and Platten [17]; they measured the
velocity proﬁles in each layer as a function of the height in a system formed by water and heptanol. They also developed
a simple theoretical model to calculate the horizontal velocity proﬁle as a function of the ratio of viscosities, expansion
coeﬃcients and thicknesses of both layers. Later on, Doi and Koster [18] studied theoretically the thermocapillary
convection under microgravity conditions in two immiscible liquid layers with a free upper surface, in 2-D geometries.
They determine under which conditions the lower layer remains at rest. Moreover they carry out numerical simulations
in a box of aspect ratio 4 in order to analyze the eﬀect of the vertical walls. Numerical simulations in cavities of
diﬀerent aspect ratios for coupled thermocapillary and buoyancy-driven convection were performed by Liu et al.[19],
and an asymptotic solution for the velocity in the limit of inﬁnite aspect ratio has also been derived [20].

The objective of the present work is to study coupled thermocapillary and buoyancy convection in a two-layer system
of inﬁnite horizontal extension subject to lateral heating and to ﬁnd out the regimes occurring in this conﬁguration.
A linear approach to the problem is carried out, showing the kind of oscillatory and stationary behaviors that occur
in this system.

The paper is organized as follows: In section II, the general equations governing the problem are established. Section
III is devoted to the derivation of the temperature and velocity proﬁles of the basic ﬂow, the explicit expressions are
reported in the Appendix. In section IV is carried out a linear stability analysis of the basic state towards bidimensional
and three dimensional perturbations. Conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

We consider a system of two horizontal superimposed immiscible liquid layers of thickness h(i), densities ρ(i),
kinematic viscosities ν(i), coeﬃcients of volume expansion α(i), thermal conductivities λ(i) and thermal diﬀusivities
κ(i), superscript i = 1, 2 refers to the lower and upper ﬂuid respectively. The system is inﬁnite in the horizontal
extension and is limited in the vertical direction by two horizontal rigid and thermally conductive walls (see Fig.
1). The interface between both liquids is assumed to be horizontal and nondeformable. The origin of the Cartesian
reference system is ﬁxed at the interface.

The system is heated, with a constant temperature gradient β imposed along the horizontal direction, which
produces a conducting temperature proﬁle given by T = T− + βx, where T− is the temperature of the cold side.
The Boussinesq approximation is taken for granted in both layers. The system is subject to the gravity ﬁeld and its
density is given by the state equation ρ(i) = ρ(i)
0 [1 − α(i)(T − T−)]. The interfacial tension which acts at the interface
admits a temperature variation approximated by the linear equation of state σ = σ0 − γ(T − T−) where γ = − ∂σ
∂T is
a positive constant (at least for the pairs of liquids considered in this work).

The governing equations expressing the balance of mass, momentum and energy in the Boussinesq approximation

are given by

+ (u(i) · ∇)u(i) = −

− g[1 − α(T (i) − T−)]ˆz + ν(i)∇2u(i),

∇ · u(i) = 0,

wherein u(i)(u(i), v(i), w(i)) is the velocity ﬁeld, p(i) the pressure, g the acceleration of the gravity, and ˆz the unit
vector in the vertical direction. The boundary conditions at the rigid and thermally conductive bottom and upper
walls are

z = −h(1) → u(1) = 0;
z = h(2) → u(2) = 0;

T (1) = Tw (Tw = T− + βx),
T (2) = Tw (Tw = T− + βx).

Furthermore, one must include the conditions of continuity of the temperature, heat ﬂow and velocity at the interface
(the normal velocity component is zero because the interface is supposed to be nondeformable)

III. THE BASIC STATE

When a horizontal gradient is imposed, a stationary basic ﬂow sets in each liquid [2] with a horizontal velocity
component depending on the vertical coordinate u(i) = (u(i)
0 (z), 0, 0). On the other hand, the basic temperature
proﬁle is the superposition of the imposed horizontal gradient and the vertical proﬁle τ (i)(z) generated by the ﬂuid
motion: T (i) = T− + x + τ (i)(z) (in nondimensional form). To calculate u(i)

0 (z) and τ (i)(z) we replace

u(i) = (u(i)

0 (z), 0, 0) ,

T (i) − T− = x + τ (i)(z),

in (4) and (5) and eliminating the pressure one obtains the following equations governing the behavior of the velocity
and temperature ﬁelds in both liquids:

τ (i), whose expressions in terms of z are found in the Appendix.

0 and

As shown by Eqs.

(14-17) the basic velocity and temperature proﬁles are the sum of a thermocapillary term
proportional to the Marangoni number M a and a buoyancy term proportional to the Rayleigh number Ra. The
velocity proﬁle is a second order polynomial in z in the interfacial term and of third order in the buoyancy. Whereas
the temperature proﬁle is fourth order in the interfacial term and ﬁfth in the buoyancy.

The velocity and temperature proﬁles depend on the ratios of the various transport coeﬃcients and depths. For a
given experimental set-up the heating does not aﬀect the shape of the basic velocity and temperature proﬁles since
the temperature gradient appears as a constant factor in u(i)
0 and τ (i) through the Rayleigh and Marangoni numbers.
Each velocity proﬁle has a root located at its corresponding rigid wall (as imposed by the boundary conditions
(6a-6b)). There is also a second root inside each layer due to the return ﬂow condition. In absence of gravity, this
root is located at z = −1/3 in the lower layer and at z = a/3 in the upper ﬂuid, i.e. one third of the depth counted
from the interface, and the ﬂow consists of one convective cell in each layer. When gravity is taken into account the
position of these roots depend on the properties of the ﬂuids and a third root can be present, allowing for a second
convective cell in each layer. The temperature proﬁles have also a root located at the bounding horizontal walls. In
presence of gravity it is possible to ﬁnd until ﬁve roots in each layer.

A. Velocity and temperature proﬁles

The ﬂow is driven by interfacial tension gradients, and by density diﬀerences when the gravity is acting. As usually,
it is assumed that the surface tension decreases with temperature (γ > 0), so that a horizontal temperature gradient
gives rise to tangential forces that drive the ﬂuid from hot to cold regions. Therefore, with only thermocapillary
eﬀects present, a general circulation around the interface is established that will drag the ﬂuid from the hot to the
cold side. In a ﬁnite container, by continuity, the ﬂuid in the upper layer raises near the cold side and falls down

5

near the hot one; on the contrary, in the lower layer it falls along the cold side and raises up at the hot one. One
would therefore observe two counter-rotating cells. Buoyancy forces also drive the ﬂuid from hot (lower density) to
cold regions (higher density). Since the ﬂuid raises along the hot side and falls at the colder one, in both cells, the
buoyancy will favor the formation of two co-rotating cells. In coupled thermocapillary-buoyancy convection, buoyancy
and interfacial forces are acting in the same direction in the lower layer, just like in one-liquid systems with γ > 0.
However they act in opposite directions in the upper layer, where the forces are competing (see Fig. 2). Thus the
liquid 2 exhibits a scenario similar to that of a one-liquid system with γ < 0 . (This occurs in some ceramics and
liquid alloys, like Ag P b, [21]. )

In Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) are displayed the basic velocity and temperature proﬁles. Along the horizontal axis is
reported the total depth (hT ) of the two superposed ﬂuids while the vertical axis gives the percentage of depth of
the lower liquid with respect to the total depth, i.e. the fractional bottom depth ˆh1 (ˆh1 = 100/(1 + h(2)/h(1))). The
curves refer to a conﬁguration formed by perﬂuorinated HT-70 (lower ﬂuid) and 5 cSt silicon oil (upper ﬂuid), this
pair of ﬂuids has been used in a recent experiment with vertical heating by Juel et al. [15]. (The physical properties of
these liquids are listed in Tab. I.) In both ﬁgures, four diﬀerent regions denoted (I) to (IV) are distinguished. Let us
pay attention to Fig. 3(a). The region (I) extends to all hT and covers principally high values of ˆh1. The basic state
consists of a clockwise convective cell in liquid 2, and a counterclockwise cell in liquid 1; in this region the direction
of the general circulation is governed by the interfacial forces. In region (II), the competition between buoyancy and
interfacial forces gives birth to two sublayers in liquid 2. The motion in the sublayer close to the interface is dominated
by the interfacial forces, but near the top wall it is the buoyancy that contributes to create a second sublayer. In
regions (I) and (II), the general ﬂow structure in liquid 1 is not changed by the motion of the upper liquid. However
for high hT and small ˆh1 the motion in layer 1 is driven by the upper liquid. This is the case of regions (III) and
(IV), where the direction of circulation close to the interface changes its sign. This is so because the buoyancy force
acting on liquid 2 is so strong that it does not only drive the motion in the upper layer but it also modiﬁes the ﬂow
direction near the interface. In (III) two convection cells are found in liquid 1, but the one close to the lower surface
is no longer driven by liquid 2. In region (IV) one observes the opposite scenario to (I), i.e. two convection cells but
with the liquid ﬂowing from the cold to the hot side near the interface. (The behavior of the lower liquid is analogous
to that of a single liquid with γ < 0 [21].) Contrary to the zero gravity problem [18] states with one of the two layers
at rest are not found in the present problem.

Let us now examine the temperature ﬁeld in the basic state (Fig. 3(b)). The four regions do not coincide with
these of the velocity ﬁeld but they are related. Region (I) covers more than half the surface of Fig. 3(b). Liquid 2
is unstably stratiﬁed (temperature increases with depth), in liquid 1 one ﬁnds a lower layer close to the wall which
is unstably stratiﬁed, and above it one distinguishes a stably stratiﬁed sublayer (temperature decreases with depth).
Region (II) is the only closed area: the lower liquid 1 is stably stratiﬁed whereas the upper liquid 2 is characterized
by two stable stratiﬁed sublayers adjacent to the wall and the interface, in the middle there is an unstable stratiﬁed
region, giving raise to a S-shaped proﬁle. Region (III) shows the most complicated temperature proﬁle:
liquid 2
exhibits two unstably stratiﬁed sublayers at the boundaries and a stable sublayer in the intermediate region, liquid 1
consists in three sublayers, the intermediate being stably stratiﬁed while the two others are unstably stratiﬁed. Zone
(IV) covers the low ˆh1 and almost all hT values, the global proﬁle is similar to that of region (I), with the interface
located at smaller ˆh1 so that liquid 1 is unstably stratiﬁed.

As soon as a horizontal temperature diﬀerence ∆T is applied, convective cells typical of the basic state set in,
but a further increase of ∆T may destabilize this basic ﬂow. To analyze the stability of the reference state with

We are faced with an eigenvalue problem which is solved by means of a tau spectral method, by approximating the
eigenfunctions with Chebyshev polynomials of order 16. The marginal curves are found by searching the set of values
kx, ky, M a for which the rate of temporal growth is zero.

V. RESULTS OF THE LINEAR ANALYSIS

Three mechanisms are able to destabilize the system under study. Basic temperature proﬁles in Fig. 3(b) present
unstably stratiﬁed zones (temperature increases with depth) and other zones which are stably stratiﬁed (temperature
decreases with depth), in the unstably stratiﬁed regions the Rayleigh-B´enard instability may arise. A second mecha-
nism is the usual B´enard-Marangoni instability when the interface is colder than the adjacent ﬂuid. Finally, a third
destabilizing mechanism arises even when the core of the layers is colder than the interface, provided the velocity ﬂow
is strong enough to overcome the stabilizing vertical temperature ﬁeld [3].

Owing to the great number of parameters involved in a two-layer conﬁguration, the results will be discussed in
the case of selected pairs of liquids used in experiments. The calculations have been made for the pair 5 cSt silicon
oil (upper liquid) and perﬂuorinated HT-70 (lower liquid), but later on we also consider the combinations: water
(upper ﬂuid) with perﬂuorinated hydrocarbon Fc-75 (lower liquid), and n-hexane (upper liquid) with acetonitrile
(lower liquid). The parameter values of these ﬂuids are gathered in Tab. I. Deformability is generally quantiﬁed by
means of the so-called crispation number, deﬁned as Cr = ρ(1)ν(1)κ(1)
. As shown in Tab. I the values of Cr are very
small for the pairs of liquids examined in the present work. Then the hypothesis of nondeformability of the interface is
reasonable as it has been shown en earlier publications [22, 23]. Moreover, we will not pay attention to the particular
ˆh1 values close to 0% or 100% because in these cases thin ﬁlm motions (outside the scope of the present analysis)
would appear.

A. Stationary longitudinal rolls

7

First, we consider 2-D perturbations characterized by kx = 0 and ω = 0 (longitudinal stationary rolls). Our analysis
extends for two layer systems that of Gershuni et al. [5], who considered a one-single ﬂuid layer bounded by horizontal
rigid-free and perfectly thermal conductive surfaces, and Mercier and Normand [6], who considered the heat transfer
at the free surface by means of a Biot number.

Fig. 4 displays the critical Marangoni and the critical spanwise wavenumber versus the fractional bottom depth
for several values of the total depth hT (3, 6 and 9 mm). For total depths of 3 and 6 mm, one observes three
stationary branches, while for hT = 9 mm an additional branch is clearly seen for low ˆh1. Fig. 4(a) shows that
the critical Marangoni number decreases with hT . This is due to the destabilizing eﬀect of the increase of depth in
Rayleigh-B´enard instability. All the curves exhibit the most stable zone for ˆh1 ≈ 60%. The jump from one branch to
another is better appreciated by the discontinuities in ky in Fig. 4(b). The spanwise wavenumber ky for hT = 3 mm
and hT = 6 mm increases with ˆh1 in the ﬁrst branch, however it decreases in the second one together with that of
hT = 9 mm, the dependence with ˆh1 in third branch is more involved for the three depths. In the branch jump the
marginal Marangoni curve is bimodal [6], switching the absolute minimum between two wavenumbers. This modal
change gives rise to diﬀerent states in the two-layer system.

In Fig. 5 are represented the isotherms and the velocity ﬁelds in the plane z − y as observed at the critical threshold.
At small fractional bottom depths ( ˆh1 = 14% in Fig. 5(a)) strong temperature gradients are found in the bulk of
liquid 1, whereas in liquid 2 they are concentrated near the interface z = 0, where they are less important. A similar
behavior is exhibited by the velocity ﬁelds. For large fractional bottom depths ( ˆh1 = 80% in Fig. 5(b)) located at
other branch the temperature gradients are concentrated in liquid 1 near the interface and do not penetrate into the
bulk of the lower liquid, the velocity ﬁeld is the largest in the lower liquid and is felt of roughly the same depth than
the temperature gradients. Other stationary branches exhibit diﬀerent kind of behaviors.

B. Three dimensional perturbations

However, one cannot exclude the possibility that the most unstable disturbances are three dimensional. If follows
that a minimization process with respect to kx and ky is required to ﬁnd the critical parameters. A typical stability
surface is shown in Fig. 6. In presence of lateral heating the reﬂection symmetry in the direction x is broken. Hence
the marginal surface is only symmetrical under the changes ky → −ky. The marginal surface is, in general, more
complicated because several intermingled branches arise. The position of the minimum is given by the kx and ky
components of the critical wavenumber, which in the case of oscillatory instability also determine the direction of
propagation ϕ of the waves. Recalling that the positive x axis is directed from the cold to hot side according to
Eq. (7) the hydrothermal waves will propagate from cold to hot for ϕ ∈ [0o, 90o], in contrast for ϕ ∈ [90o, 180o] the
direction of propagation is the opposite. Note that the symmetry (y → −y) of the linear problem makes that the
waves with wavenumber (kx, ±ky) become unstable simultaneously. From now on, we will restrict to ϕ ∈ [0o, 180o]
without lost of generality.

In Fig. 7(a) are represented the critical Marangoni number, frequency, angle and modulus of the wavenumber for
the system HT-70 (lower liquid) and 5 cSt silicon oil (upper liquid) with hT = 9 mm. The critical Marangoni curve
exhibits a local maximum M 1 and a local minimum at ˆh1 = 31%. The Marangoni number reaches its maximum value
in M 2, which is a crossing point between two branches.

Beyond M 2, the behavior of the critical Marangoni is the same as in a one-layer system ﬁlled by the lower ﬂuid.

In such a case the critical Marangoni also decreases and the spanwise wavenumber increases with the depth [5].

The position of M 2 depends on the physical properties of both ﬂuids. To study the eﬀect of the transport coeﬃcients,
i.e. viscosity ν and thermal diﬀusivity κ on the position of M 2 we have considered an ideal system formed by two
layers of 5 cSt silicon oil which diﬀer only by their values of ν and κ. In Tab. II are given the positions of M 2 for
diﬀerent values of the transport coeﬃcients. By increasing the thermal diﬀusivity and viscosity of the lower liquid,
the position of M 2 is shifted towards higher values of ˆh1; on the contrary if ν and κ are increased in the upper liquid
the shift is towards lower values of ˆh1. The location of M 2 depends also on the geometry of the system: an increase
of hT produces a shift towards a greater ˆh1, however for high hT values the shift becomes saturated, as shown by the
Marangoni curves of Figs. 7 and 8.

Examination of the vertical proﬁle of temperature of the basic state allow us to determine the positions of the local
maximum M 1 at 21% and of the local minimum at about 31%. Fig. 3(b) displays the vertical proﬁle of temperature;
it is seen that, for hT = 9 mm, starting from the region (I) and decreasing ˆh1 up to 31% the unstable vertical proﬁle
of the upper ﬂuid splits in two smaller unstable sublayers and a third one in the middle which is stable. The shape
of the temperature proﬁle remains unchanged in liquid 1.

8

In the conﬁguration represented by region (III), there is a greater extension of the stable regions than in (I), thus
the scenario in (III) consists in an increase of M a due to the progressive stabilization of the upper layer when ˆh1
decreases. The border between regions (I) and (III) gives the position of the local minimum of Fig. 7(a). However
when region (IV) is attained the stratiﬁcation in liquid 1 becomes unstable and the whole system is more and more
unstable, with a decrease of M a. This ﬁnds its roots in the two driving forces (thermocapillary and buoyancy), which
are both destabilizing and cooperatives for the perturbations undergone by the lower liquid. As a consequence, the
border between regions (III) and (IV) of Fig. 3(b) gives the position of M 1. Inside (IV) the decrease of M a when ˆh1
is lowered reﬂects the greater importance of the destabilizing eﬀect of the interfacial tension. The position of M 1 is
predicted by the vertical temperature proﬁle of the basic state and it will not be inﬂuenced by the Prandtl number.
One distinguishes three main regions A, B, C in the curves of Figs. 7 and 8 giving the critical parameters as a

function of the relative depth of the liquids.

The ﬁrst region A extends from the lowest value of ˆh1 until M 2. The critical Marangoni increases with the drop
of the depth of the upper liquid because of the decrease of the buoyancy eﬀects in it, indicating that the upper liquid
dominates the dynamics in A. The pattern in this region consists of hydrothermal waves with zero or small angles
of propagation. They propagate from cold to hot regions with an angle parallel to the gradient of temperature for
hT = 6, 9 mm, deviating to greater angles when the thermocapillary eﬀects are relatively more important, as for
hT = 3 mm. Concerning the oscillatory modes, the angle of propagation is similar to single liquids with a high P r [3].
As seen in Fig. 7(d), region A is characterized by an increase of |k| with ˆh1, with a small dependence of |k| on hT .
At hT = 9 mm, where the buoyancy eﬀects are more important, one ﬁnds a range of depth ratios 6% < ˆh1 < 16%
where the critical modes take the form of stationary rolls. At the borders of this window, there is a codimension-two
(cod-2) point formed by the interaction between a Hopf mode and a stationary mode of diﬀerent wavenumbers. Such
cod-2 points were also found in two-liquid layers heated from below [24].

Region B is characterized by a strong jump of the frequency at M 2 for hT = 6, 9 mm, and weakly shifted by ∆ˆh1 = 4
for hT = 3 mm. For hT = 6, 9 mm, M 2 is characterized by a pair of Hopf modes with ﬁnite and diﬀerent wavenumbers
and frequencies which are simultaneously critical. At this point of cod-2 the conﬁguration is the most stable with
the greatest M a. The diﬀerence between the wavenumbers of the two Hopf modes is due to the occurrence of a large
spanwise component for hT = 9 mm, while for hT = 6 mm there exists only a jump in the streamwise component.
To our knowledge this kind of interaction between two oscillatory modes has not yet received attention in B´enard–
Marangoni problems. For hT = 3 mm, the presence of a small stationary branch near M 2 prevents the existence of
this kind of interaction, and the cod-2 point is generated by a stationary mode and a Hopf mode. Concerning the
hydrothermal waves, the corresponding angles of propagation are greater than the angles of propagation in region A.
The direction of propagation of the hydrothermal waves in this region is reversed, propagating from the hot to the
cold side. The width of region B decreases with hT , from ∆ˆh1 = 18% for hT = 9 mm to ∆ˆh1 = 14% for hT = 3 mm.
The modulus of the wavenumber varies in a more complicated way than in the region A, and is more sensitive to the
total depth. In region B, the strong competition between the two layers is responsible for the oscillatory convection.

region B

region C

The transition from the second region B to the third region C is smooth with a monotonous decrease of the frequency
of the oscillatory branch. The third region is characterized by stationary longitudinal rolls and extends up to the
highest ˆh1. It spreads towards lower ˆh1 when the total depth is increased. The dynamics of this region is dominated
by the lower layer. The qualitative behavior of the modulus k of the wavenumber is practically unaﬀected by the
overall depth.

In Fig. 9(a) are shown the critical parameters for the bilayer formed by perﬂuorinated hydrocarbon Fc-75 (lower
liquid) and water (upper ﬂuid), whereas in Fig. 9(b) are reproduced the results for the couple acetonitrile (lower
liquid) and n-hexane (upper liquid). Both setups have been experimentally studied in the case of a vertical heating
[13, 14, 15]. The instability thresholds are evaluated for a total depth of 6 mm in both conﬁgurations. The critical
Marangoni curves exhibit maxima at M 1 and M 2 as discussed above. In the case Fc-75/water, hydrothermal waves

9

which propagate from cold to hot in the region located between M 1 and M 2 are found, for the other values of the
fractional bottom depth stationary longitudinal rolls are forecast. The system acetonitrile/n-hexane presents the same
three regions as exhibited by the pair 5 cSt silicon oil/HT-70 with a cod-2 point created by two oscillatory modes
with diﬀerent frequency and wavenumbers. The general features discussed earlier in this section remain valid for all
the cases which have been examined.

Tuning the relative depths of both layers, according to our theoretical study it would be possible to obtain in the
same experimental conﬁguration with a ﬁxed pair of liquids all the patterns observed in diﬀerent single layer systems:
from longitudinal stationary rolls to hydrothermal waves with directions of propagation ranging from small angles of
propagation (as in one-liquid systems with high P r) to high angles (as in one-liquid systems with small P r).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the onset of convection in systems constituted by horizontal liquid layers subjected to a lateral
heating. The system is bounded by two rigid and thermally conductive horizontal walls and the interface is supposed
to be nondeformable. The acting forces are the interfacial tension and the gravity. They are cooperative in the lower
layer and competitive in the upper one. The number of parameters is greatly enhanced with respect to the case of
one-layer problems. We have considered three diﬀerent combinations of liquids, namely bilayers of perﬂuorinate HT-70
and 5 cSt silicon oil, perﬂuorinate Fc-75 and water, and acetonitrile and n-hexane; these ﬂuids have been considered
because they have already been the subject of experiments involving a vertical heating [15]. It is our hope that the
results of the present paper will motivate researchers to repeat these experiments with a lateral heating.

As soon as a horizontal temperature gradient is applied, a global circulation takes place in each layer. The tem-
perature and velocity ﬁelds of the basic state have been derived and discussed. For a given experimental setup and a
ﬁxed heating, the two control parameters are the total depth and the depth ratio between the liquids. In a diagram
representing the depth ratio versus the total depth, four regions for the temperature and velocity proﬁles have been
distinguished. The main information drawn from this diagram can be summarized as follows. The interaction between
interfacial tension and buoyancy can give rise to: 1) a counter-rotating cell in each layer, 2) two counter-rotating cells
in the upper liquid and one cell in the lower one, in both cases one observes a ﬂow from hot to cold near the interface ;
3) to two counter-rotating cells in the lower liquid and a cell in the upper one, 4) a counter-rotating cell in each liquid,
but with the ﬂow being dragged near the interface from cold to hot in the last two cases. We have also determined
the diﬀerent temperature proﬁles that result from the interplay between thermal diﬀusivity and ﬂuid motion.

The linearized evolution equations for the perturbations of the basic state have been established and the ensuing
eigenvalue problem has been solved. Bidimensional and three dimensional perturbations have been respectively
considered. A physical interpretation of the diﬀerent regions found has been proposed. The interest of the present
analysis with respect a one-layer system is that it exhibits a great variety of behaviors depending on the nature of the
liquids the total depth and relative depth between the layers. Among the most interesting results can be mentioned
the occurrence of a cod-2 point arising as a consequence of the interaction between two Hopf modes with diﬀerent
frequency and wavenumber. Furthermore, three diﬀerent patterns are predicted: 1) hydrothermal waves propagating
from cold to hot side with a small angle, which is typical of lateral heating in one-liquid systems with high P r, 2)
hydrothermal waves propagating from hot to cold, and 3) longitudinal stationary rolls.

The variety of results conﬁrms that the problem of lateral heating in two-layer systems is a promising and interesting
area of research, both from the theoretical and experimental points of view. It would be specially interesting to study
the system close to M 2 when we have interplay between two oscillatory modes.

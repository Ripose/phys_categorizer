Abstract

In the present study, we use a ﬁfth-order ordinary differential equation, a generalization of the Blasius

equation derived from the Leray-α model of turbulence, to examine rough-wall turbulent velocity proﬁles.

This equation, combined with a weaker formulation of the von K´arm´an log law modiﬁed to include the

effects of surface roughness, provides a family of turbulent velocity proﬁles with only one free parameter, a

momentum thickness based Reynolds number. The family of velocity proﬁles are in good agreement with

experimental data. Additionally, we derive a theoretical correlation of the skin-friction coefﬁcient across

a range of Reynolds numbers, and for various values of the roughness function, ∆u/uτ . Predictions of

maximal skin-friction values and critical Reynolds numbers are also made based on the roughness function.

INTRODUCTION

Wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows continue to be signiﬁcant in both the natural environment and

in engineering applications. As such, the turbulence community has persistently endeavored to

describe the ﬂuid dynamics in such ﬂows [14]. In particular, the determination of skin-friction

(or wall shear stress) has been of interest to many researchers.

For smooth-wall turbulent boundary layers, both direct and indirect techniques have been

developed to determine skin-friction. These include the use of the momentum integral equation,

correlations based on pressure measurements at the surface, and ﬁtting mean velocity proﬁles

based on a defect or power law [2].

However, in the rough-wall case [10, 11], direct measurement of skin-friction is often difﬁcult.

Indirect methods have included using friction velocity, uτ , to estimate skin-friction. The modiﬁed

Clauser method, for instance, has been used to approximate uτ by ﬁtting a logarithmic velocity

proﬁle to experimental data. However, as discussed by Acharya and Escudier [1], this technique

is subject to large uncertainties because the degrees of freedom are increased from one (cf ) for a

smooth surface to three (cf , ǫ, ∆u/uτ ), where cf is the skin-friction coefﬁcient, ǫ is the error in

origin, and ∆u/uτ is the roughness function. Alternative indirect techniques include determining

uτ using a velocity defect law, or power law formulations. Other correlations such as Bergstrom

et al.’s skin-friction correlation with the ratio of the displacement and boundary-layer thicknesses

have also been suggested [2].

In this study, we derive a skin-friction correlation for rough-wall turbulent boundary layers

from the Leray-α turbulence model introduced by Cheskidov, Holm, Olson, and Titi in [4] and

proposed as a closure approximation of the Reynolds equations.

Reducing the Leray-α model to a generalization of the Blasius equation and using a shifted

von K´arm´an log law [8, 9, 12], we obtain a family of turbulent velocity proﬁles determined by

only one parameter, a momentum thickness based Reynolds number. This results in a prediction

of skin-friction coefﬁcients for rough-wall turbulent boundary layers across a range of Reynolds

numbers. Additionally, we study the inﬂuence of the roughness function ∆u/uτ on the maximal

value of skin-friction and a critical Reynolds number for which a velocity proﬁle can be turbulent.

A. Boundary-layer approximation of the Leray-α model of ﬂuid turbulence

Proposed as a closure scheme for the Reynolds equations [4], the Leray-α model is written as

(1)

where u is the averaged physical velocity of the ﬂow, p is the averaged pressure, f is a force, and

ν > 0 is the viscosity. The ﬁlter length scale α, represents the averaged size of the Lagrangian

ﬂuctuations (see [3]), and is considered as a parameter of the ﬂow. More speciﬁcally, we assume

that α changes along the streamlines in the boundary layer, and is proportional to the thickness

of the boundary layer (see [5]).

Inspired by the Navier-Stokes-α model, this model compared successfully with experimen-

tal data from turbulent channel, pipe, and boundary-layer ﬂows for a wide range of Reynolds

numbers. Moreover, in [4] an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the global attractor was

obtained, which appeared to be much less than one would expect 3D turbulence model to have.

This suggests that the Leray-α model has great potential to become a good sub-grid large eddy

simulation model of turbulence, which is also supported by studying the energy spectrum both
analytically and computationally. It was shown that in addition to the usual κ−5/3 Kolmogorov

power law, the energy spectrum has a steeper power law for wave numbers larger that 1/α.

In approximating a turbulent boundary layer with the Leray-α model in the case of a zero-

pressure gradient, consider a two-dimensional ﬂow across a ﬂat surface. Let x be the coordinate
along the surface, y the coordinate normal to the surface, and u = (u, v) the velocity of the ﬂow.

Assuming that α is a function of x only, normalizing variables, and neglecting terms that are

small near the boundary (see [6]), we arrive at a Prandtl-like boundary-layer approximation of

B. A Blasius-like Solution for Flat-Plate Flow

The ﬁfth-order ordinary differential equation (3) is a generalization of the celebrated Blasius

equation. A dimensionless parameter β in the equation represents the ratio of the average size of

turbulent ﬂuctuations to the boundary-layer thickness.

This equation describes horizontal velocity proﬁles

II. VELOCITY PROFILES

From the derivation of (3) it follows that the averaged velocity proﬁles (u, v) for a ﬁxed

horizontal coordinate are modeled by the following:

where y again is the vertical coordinate, ue is the horizontal velocity of the external ﬂow, h is

a solution to (3), l is a local length scale, a parameter of the ﬂow that has to be determined,

Rl = uel/ν, and le is the external length scale le = ν/ue.

with the von K´arm´an log law:

For smooth surfaces, the mean velocity proﬁle for the inner region is commonly approximated

where the von K´arm´an constant, κ

0.4, and B

5, are empirically determined constants.

≈
In the rough-wall case, the effects of uniform roughness are conﬁned to the inner region, and

≈

are accounted for by modifying the semi-logarithmic part of the mean velocity proﬁle. More

speciﬁcally, Clauser [8, 9] showed that the semi-logarithmic region is displaced downward by

an amount ∆u/uτ . This amount of downward shift is commonly referred to as the roughness

wall, and indicates the additional wall shear stress due to the roughness. Accounting for the

where ε is the shift at the origin for the rough wall, y is measured from the top of the roughness

element, and ∆B = ∆u/uτ . The values of ε and ∆B are determined by matching experimental

velocity proﬁles with (10).

In studying turbulent velocity proﬁles, we subject proﬁles to three conditions of a weaker

formulation of the von K´arm´an log law. These conditions are:

(i) A turbulent velocity proﬁle u+

t (y+) has 3 inﬂection points in logarithmic coordinates.

(ii) The middle inﬂection point of u+

t (y+) lies on the line

u+ =

ln y+ + B

(iii) The line (11) is tangent to u+

t (y+) at the middle inﬂection point.

We will see that these conditions reduce (9) to a one-parameter family of velocity proﬁles.

It was

numerically determined that for approximately 350 < Rθ < 3000, equation (15) has a unique

solution cf = f (Rθ). Therefore, for turbulent velocity proﬁles the skin-friction coefﬁcient is a

function of the Reynolds number based on momentum thickness. This one-parameter family of

rough-wall turbulent velocity proﬁles was compared with experimental data of Osaka et al. [13],

for d-type roughness with Rθ = 700, 790, 1230, 2000. Figure 1 and 2 compare the particular

cases of Rθ = 700 and 1230, respectively.

V. THEORETICAL SKIN-FRICTION LAWS FOR ROUGH-WALL TURBULENT BOUNDARY

LAYERS

The unique solution to equation (15) leads to a skin-friction law cf = f (Rθ), which is shown

in Fig. 3 for several different values of roughness function, ∆B = ∆u/uτ . At the critical points

where Rθ is at a minimum and cf is at a maximal value, the second and third inﬂection points
of the velocity proﬁles collide, and the proﬁles will then only have one inﬂection point for Rθ ≤
Rcrit
, for which a velocity

proﬁle can still be turbulent. Additionally, cmax

is the largest value of skin-friction coefﬁcient

that a turbulent velocity proﬁle is predicted to reach.

As demonstrated in Figure 3, higher values of roughness function will allow velocity proﬁles

to remain turbulent at lower Reynolds numbers, but furthermore will result in higher values of
cmax
f

. Figure 4 shows how roughness function is predicted to inﬂuence the value of maximum

skin-friction coefﬁcient.

Finally, it is remarkable that the minimum value of Reynolds number for which a velocity

proﬁle can be turbulent, Rcrit

, exhibits a linear dependency on the roughness function (see Figure

5). More precisely, we found the following correlation:

VI. CONCLUSION

Based on the Leray-α model of ﬂuid turbulence, a generalized Blasius equation was formu-

lated to describe streamwise velocity proﬁles in turbulent boundary layers with zero pressure

gradients. Solutions of this ﬁfth-order differential equation yielded a two-parameter family of

velocity proﬁles. Turbulent velocity proﬁles were then further isolated by subjecting the proﬁles

to three conditions of a weak formulation of the von K´arm´an log law, more speciﬁcally the im-
portant condition of having the middle inﬂection point of u+
t (y+) lie on the line (11). This lent to

a one-parameter family of turbulent velocity proﬁles, with the free parameter being a Reynolds

number based on momentum thickness. The family of velocity proﬁles were also in good agree-

ment with experimental data of Osaka [13].

Theoretical skin-friction laws were developed for several different roughness functions, and it

was shown that the greater the ∆B (i.e., ∆u/uτ ), the longer a velocity proﬁle could remain turbu-

lent in the low Reynolds number region, and furthermore the higher the skin-friction coefﬁcient

peaks.

The effect that the roughness function has on the maximal skin-friction coefﬁcient and critical

Reynolds number are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The roughness function and critical

Reynolds number appeared to have a linear relationship.

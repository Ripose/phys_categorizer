We found the energetic stability criteria of non-equilibrium gase plain ﬂows.

Abstract

The second (volume) viscosity coeﬃcient ζ can be negative in nonequilibrium me-
dia. Medium with the negative second viscosity is acoustically unstable. The nonlinear
structures in the acoustically active gases is strongly diﬀerent from that in the equilib-
rium media. In present paper we investigate some problems, connected with the second
viscosity inﬂuence on ﬂow characteristics.

Let us consider the thin body (lx/ly ≫

Using equation (1) we obtain the coeﬃcients of resistance Cx and lifting force Cy. In
the limit case of homogeneous nonequilibrium particles distribution the expressions for
these coeﬃcients is reduced to form:

second viscosity.

The result, presented above, is only correct for laminated streams. In the nonequi-
librium media the bounds of laminar region is changed. The traditional neglect of the
second viscosity in subsonics is not correct if ζ
η, where η, is the shear viscosity
coeﬃcient. For example, in CO2, N2O - gases the relation ζ/η > 103, as T > 300K.
([Emanuel 1990]). Therefore, the second viscosity is essential for the sound propagation
and the supersonic ﬂows.

At ζ = 0, condition (2) is similar to one from the ([Landau et al. 1988]). At ζ > 0,
the instability threshold increases comparatively with the ([Landau et al. 1988]). Other-
wise at ζ < 0, but

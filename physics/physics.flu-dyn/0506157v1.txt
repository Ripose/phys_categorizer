Lattice Boltzmann Method with regularized non-equilibrium distribution functions

(Dated: April 24, 2005)

A new lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is introduced, based on a regularization of the pre-collision
distribution functions in terms of the local density, velocity, and momentum ﬂux tensor. The model
dramatically improves the precision and numerical stability for the simulation of ﬂuid ﬂows by LB
methods. This claim is supported by simulation results of some 2D and 3D ﬂows.

PACS numbers: 47.11.+j, 05.20.Dd

The lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is a recent tech-
nique for the simulation and modeling of ﬂuid ﬂows [1–
5]. During the past ﬁfteen years it has been successfully
applied to many challenging problems in hydrodynamics
as well as reaction-diﬀusion processes and wave propa-
gation phenomena [6]. A particular shortcoming of this
technique are numerical instabilities, that may develop
at high Reynolds numbers. Several improvements to the
method have been proposed, which however either induce
a substantial complication of the original algorithm, or
require a cumbersome ﬁne-tuning of adjustable parame-
ters [7, 8]. The present paper introduces a new method
which ﬁts quite naturally into the framework of classi-
cal LB models and oﬀers both increased accuracy and
stability at very low cost.

The LB approach considers a mesoscopic description
of the ﬂuid on a regular lattice of spacing δr in d-
dimensions. The central quantities of the LB approach
are distribution functions fi(~r, t), which denote the den-
sity of particles entering a lattice site ~r at discrete time t
with velocity ~vi. The ~vi are vectors connecting any lattice
site ~r with its z neighbors ~r + δt~vi, δt being the time step
and z the lattice coordination number. A vector ~v0 = 0
corresponding to a rest population f0 is also introduced.
The LB dynamics are expressed as

fi(~r + δt~vi, t + δt) = fi(~r, t) + Ωi(f (~r, t)),

(1)

where i, here and in subsequent formulas, runs from 0 to
z. The dynamics can be split conceptually into a collision
step by deﬁning f out
i = fi + Ωi(f ), and a propagation
step: fi(~r + δt~vi, t + δt) = f out
(~r, t). During the collision
i
step, the advected particle streams fi are summed up
with the collision terms Ωi, which are given functions of
the fi’s. They describe how ﬂuid particles colliding at site
~r change their velocities to vi. Then, at the propagation
step, the ﬂuid particles are streamed to the neighboring
site ~r + δt ~vi.

As in any standard kinetic theory, the macroscopic
quantities are obtained by taking the ﬁrst velocity mo-
ments of the distribution functions:

ρ =

(2)

where ρ, ~u, and Π are the ﬂuid density, momentum, and
momentum ﬂux tensor respectively (Note that the ac-
tual momentum ﬂux tensor in LB models has an extra
lattice contribution, which adds on to Π.). Here and in
what follows, Greek indices label the components of two-
dimensional (2D) resp. three-dimensional (3D) physical
space, whereas Latin indices refer to the z+1-dimensional
space of the distribution functions. Vectors situated in
the former space are characterized by an arrow on top
of the letter, and in the latter space, simply by omitting
the index.

The collision term Ω is chosen in such a manner that
mass and momentum are conserved exactly (without dis-
cretization error), so as to closely reﬂect the physical laws
at the base of hydrodynamics. Its most common imple-
mentation, the BGK model, expresses a single-time relax-
ation to a given local equilibrium function f eq, depend-
ing only on the conserved quantities ρ and ~u calculated
from (2):

Ωi = −ω (fi − f eq

i (ρ, ~u)) ,

(3)

where 0 < ω < 2 is the relaxation parameter, directly
related to the dynamic ﬂuid viscosity ν.

The expression for f eq comes from a low Mach num-
ber truncated Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and is ad-
justed to obtain the correct momentum ﬂux tensor:

this index. The tensors Qiαβ are deﬁned to be Qiαβ =

sδαβ, and the ti’s, as well as cs, are coeﬃcients
speciﬁc to the lattice topology.

The connection between the LB method and the cor-
responding hydrodynamics is obtained through a Tay-
lor expansion, up to second order in δt, of the ﬁ-
nite diﬀerences in the left hand side of Eq. (1), and a

Using expressions (4) and (8) together with the lattice
contribution to the momentum ﬂux (see for instance [3]),
it can be shown that ~u obeys the Navier-Stokes equation
with the viscosity given by

to the following steps:

However,

in actual numerical simulations, the pro-
posed theoretical description of the LB dynamics is not
fully obeyed because δt and δr are not arbitrarily small,
and also because higher order derivatives are neglected
in the approximation (7). As a result, the numerical
behavior departs from its hydrodynamic limits and nu-
merical instabilities may appear if some quantities vary
too sharply over time and space.

i − f (1)

The inaccuracy of the ﬁrst-order terms f (1) becomes
apparent, e.g., upon the observation that, according to
Eq. (7), f (1) is symmetric with respect to spatial reﬂec-
tions: the diﬀerence f (1)
vanishes along directions
j
i, j for which vi = −vj. In practice, this relation is not
necessarily obeyed by the non-equilibrium parts of the
distribution functions. On Fig. 1, ∆ij = f neq
is
plotted, for a given couple {i, j}, on ground of some nu-
merical data of the Kovasznay ﬂow described below. It
appears to take nonnegligible values at the scale of non-
equilibrium terms (up to 30%).

i − f neq

To reduce the discrepancy between f neq and f (1), we
propose a regularization procedure whose goal is to force
the numerical scheme to comply as much as possible with
the theoretical framework exposed above. For this pur-
pose we recompute f neq prior to the collision step so as
to enforce f neq = f (1). The key of our regularization
procedure is the observation that Eqs. (7) and (8) can be
combined to give

In order to better understand the way the steps de-
scribed in Eq. (11) act on the distribution functions, it
is illuminating to study the dynamics in the (z + 1)-
dimensional space of the velocity moments. These mo-
ments [a few of them are shown in Eq. (2)] are associ-
ated in kinetic theory with so-called modes of the colli-
sion operator and can be related to transport phenom-
ena during the collision process. In general, the moment
space is related to the space of the distribution functions
through an invertible linear mapping whose matrix M
is explicited, e.g., in [7]. The regularized dynamics pre-
sented in Eqs. (11, 12) can be reformulated as

2D and under the assumption of ﬂuid incompressibil-
ity T r(Π) = 0, the matrix A is found to be diagonal:
A = diag(λ0, λ1, · · · , λz), where λi1 = λi2 = 1 for the

Qiαβcjαcjβ .

components of the momentum ﬂux tensor[17] and λi = 0
for the other moments.
In the general (compressible)
case, additional oﬀ-diagonal contributions appear in the
energy and square-energy moments. This interpretation
of the dynamics shows that, except for compressibility
eﬀects, the regularized dynamics directly kills all modes
but the ones associated to the momentum ﬂux tensor.

It is interesting to compare the regularized method
with so-called multi-relaxation-time (MRT) models, [7,
9], which propose the following general formulation of
the LB dynamics: f out = f (~r, t) − M −1S(F − F eq),
where F = M f is the moment space representation
of the distribution functions, S is a diagonal matrix
S = diag(s0, s1, · · · , sz) containing z + 1 individual relax-
ation parameters si, and F eq, the equilibrium distribu-
tion in moment space, depends on a set of adjustable pa-
rameters. By ﬁxing those adjustable parameters through
the relation F eq = M f eq and the relaxation parameters
through si = ω for all non-conservative momenta, the
usual BGK dynamics are recovered. It has however been
argued [7], that the stability of the BGK scheme is en-
hanced by an appropriate choice of the various relaxation
parameters.

In the case F eq = M f eq, the MRT model takes the
following form: f out = f (~r, t)−M −1SM (f −f eq), which,
in analogy with Eq. (13), can be reformulated as

f out = f eq + (1 − M

−1SM )f neq.

(14)

Here, the identity term 1 is due to the advected dis-
tribution functions, which are not touched upon by the
MRT correction to the BGK model. Eqs. (13, 14) make
the main diﬀerence between our regularized model and
the MRT approach apparent: while in the MRT ap-
proach [Eq. (14)] non-physical modes are relaxed to a
local equilibrium inside the collision term, in the regu-
larized model [Eq. (13)] these modes are more radically
eliminated in both the advected particles and the colli-
sion term. Therefore, when increasing the stability in the
simulation of a Navier-Stokes ﬂuid ﬂow is the only issue,
our method is comparatively simpler from a theoretical
viewpoint, and eﬃcient to implement.

We now turn to numerical veriﬁcations of the regular-
ized model on two 2D ﬂows using a D2Q9 lattice, and one
3D ﬂow using a D3Q19 lattice [1–3]. The ﬁrst test con-
cerns the simulation of a Kovasznay ﬂow, which approx-
imates the stationary 2D ﬂow behind a regular grid. An
analytical solution for this ﬂow, proposed in [10], takes
the following form:

ux = u∞(1 − exp(λx/L) · cos(2πy/L)) and (15)

scale of the problem. The simulations are performed in
the wake of the grid, in the intervals x ∈ [L/2, 2L] and
y ∈ [−L/2, 3L/2], with Re = 10, u∞ = 0.01 v, and with a
varying grid resolution N = L/δr. Keeping the velocity
constant in terms of the lattice unit v amounts to ﬁxing
the Mach number M a = u/cs at a value suﬃciently small
to mimic an incompressible ﬂow. Given that the ﬂow is
periodic in y-direction, the upper and the lower bound-
ary of the simulation can be chosen periodic, whereas the
Kovasznay solution [Eq. (15)] is imposed through Dirich-
let boundary conditions on the left and right boundary.
After the simulation has stabilized, the numerical result
is compared with the solution [Eq. (15)] through an L2
norm on each grid point, and then averaged over space.
The result is shown in Fig. 2, on two commonly used
implementations of the boundary conditions (bc); bc (1)
[11] and bc (2) [12]. The accuracy of the simulation with
respect to the grid resolution is of order 2 to 2.5 when the
BGK model is used, whereas the regularized model is al-
most third-order accurate. On the BGK simulations with
bc (1), data points for small grids are missing because nu-
merical instabilities make them impossible, whereas the
regularized model has no such stability deﬁciencies.

The second test case implements a ﬂow in a 2D square
cavity whose top-wall moves with a uniform velocity.
Both standard BGK and the regularized model are ﬁrst
compared with the reference solution of Ghia e.a. [13],
on a lattice size of N × N with N = 129, at Re = 100
and a top-wall velocity u0 = 0.02 v. A boundary condi-
tion described in [14] is used. The reference solution [13]
proposes a set of accurate numerical values for some x-
and some y-components of the velocity on chosen space
points. An L1 norm error with respect to these reference
points is averaged over all available points and normal-
ized with respect to u0. For the BGK model, this yields

an error of ǫ = 3.71·10−3, and for the regularized method,
of ǫ = 2.40 · 10−3. Thus, both methods solve the prob-
lem with satisfying accuracy. The regularized model is
however found to be substantially more stable. To make
this statement more quantitative, a series of simulations
is run, on which the velocity (and thus the Mach num-
ber) is kept constant at u0 = 0.02v. For several chosen
grid sizes N , the maximal Reynolds number Remax at
which the simulation remains stable (i.e. delivers ﬁnite
numerical values) is determined. Figure 3 shows that,
although both methods exhibit a linear relationship be-
tween Remax and N , the observed increase rate is 7.7
times higher for the regularized method than for BGK.
Finally, the capacity of the regularized model to rep-
resent 3D ﬂows has been explored in a preliminary study
on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a homoge-
neous and isotropic turbulent ﬂow. The system pos-
sesses periodic boundaries and is driven by an external
force that excites two wavenumbers in the limit of large
wavelengths [15, 16].
It is known that the energy in-
jected in such a system is mainly dissipated at the small-
est scales, whose size is estimated by the so-called Kol-
mogorov length lk. If these scales are not resolved with
suﬃcient accuracy in the simulation, the system accumu-
lates the energy and develops numerical instabilities. Our
numerical simulations show that indeed, when the Kol-
mogorov length is of the order of magnitude of a lattice
site, lk = 0.5 δr, with an average velocity ¯u = 0.04 v, both
BGK and the renormalized model exhibit a numerically
stable ﬂow. Furthermore, their statistical properties are

4

numerically veriﬁed to ﬁt the predictions of the theory
of ﬂuid turbulence. However, at a smaller Kolmogorov
length (and thus higher Re) lk = 0.06 δr, BGK is numeri-
cally unstable, whereas numerical stability is still ensured
by the renormalized model. This observation suggests
that the physics of the small scales are represented more
accurately by the renormalized model than by BGK.

In this paper, a novel numerical scheme has been pre-
sented for the simulation of ﬂuid ﬂows by the LB method.
It has been compared with the traditional BGK method
and shown to be substantially more precise on a prob-
lem with mathematically well deﬁned boundaries, dra-
matically more stable on a problem with high pressure
gradients on a critical point, and more robust against
an excessive energy input in a turbulent ﬂow. Given its
conceptual simplicity, we highly recommend its use as
an alternative model for the simulation of complex ﬂuid
ﬂows. We thankfully acknowledge the support by the

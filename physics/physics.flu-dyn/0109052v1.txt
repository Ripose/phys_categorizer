The proposed universality of small scale turbulence is in-
vestigated for a set of measurements in a cryogenic free jet
with a variation of the Reynolds number (Re) from 8500 to
106 (max Rλ
1200). The traditional analysis of the statis-
tics of velocity increments by means of structure functions
or probability density functions is replaced by a new method
which is based on the theory of stochastic Markovian pro-
cesses. It gives access to a more complete characterization by
means of joint probabilities of ﬁnding velocity increments at
several scales. Based on this more precise method our results
call in question the concept of universality.

turbulence – ﬂuid dynamics 47.27; Fokker–Planck equation –
stat. physics 05.10G

The complex behaviour of turbulent ﬂuid motion has
been the subject of numerous investigations over the last
60 years and still the problem is not solved [1]. Especially
the unexpected frequent occurences of high values for
velocity ﬂuctuations on small scales, known as small scale
intermittency, remain a challenging subject for further
investigations.

Following an idea by Richardson [2] and the theories
by Kolmogorov and Oboukhov [3,4], turbulence is usu-
ally assumed to be universal in the sense that for scales
r within the inertial range η
L the statistics of
the velocity ﬁeld is independent of the large scale bound-
ary conditions, the mechanism of energy dissipation and
the Reynolds number (Re). Here, L denotes the integral
length scale and η the dissipation length.

Besides its physical impacts, the assumed universality
of the turbulent cascade has gained considerable impor-
tance for models and numerical methods such as large
eddy simulations (LES), cf. [5]. Finding experimental
evidence for the validity of the assumed universality is
therefore of utmost importance.

The turbulent cascade is usually investigated by means
of the velocity diﬀerence on a certain length scale r, the
so-called longitudinal velocity increment u(r)

the statistics of u(r) is characterized by its moments
Sn
, the so-called structure functions. For
scales r within the inertial range, the structure func-
tions are commonly approximated by power laws in r:
Sn
rζn . More pronounced scaling behaviour is
found for the so-called extended selfsimilarity method [6].
Experimental investigations carried out in several ﬂow
conﬁgurations at a large variety of Reynolds numbers
yield strong evidence that the scaling exponents ζn in
fact show universal behaviour, independent of the exper-
imental setup [7]. A diﬀerent result, however, was found
for the probability density functions (pdf) p(u, r). Re-
cent studies using the theoretical framework of inﬁnitely
divisible multiplicative cascades show that the relevant
parameters describing intermittency strongly depend on
the Reynolds number [8].

From the point of view of statistics, a characterization
of the scale dependent disorder of turbulence by means
of structure functions or pdfs p(u, r) is incomplete. The-
oretical studies [9] point out that a complete statistical
characterization of the turbulent cascade has to take into
account the joint statistical properties of several incre-
ments on diﬀerent length scales. An experimental study
concerned with the statistical properties of small scale
turbulence and its possible universalities therefore re-
quires an analyzing tool which is not based on any as-
sumption on the underlying physical process and which
is capable of describing the multiscale statistics of veloc-
ity increments. Such a tool is given by the mathematical
framework of Markov processes. Recently, it has been
shown that this tool allows to derive the stochastic dif-
ferential equations governing the evolution of the velocity
increment u in the scale parameter r from experimental
data [10,11].

In this letter we present, ﬁrstly, our new method to
analyse experimental data, secondly, results for diﬀerent
Re-numbers, thirdly, experimental ﬁndings which ques-
tion the proposed universality.

The stochastic process governing the scale dependence
of the velocity increment is Markovian, if the conditional
pdf p(u1, r1|
u2, r2; ...; uN , rN ) fulﬁlls the relation [12,13]:
p(u1, r1|

scales ri and diﬀerences of scales ∆r = ri+1 −

mean free path of molecules undergoing a Brownian mo-
tion.

As a consequence of (2), the joint pdf of N increments

Equation (3) indicates the importance of the Markovian
property for the analysis of the turbulent cascade: The
entire information about the stochastic process, i.e. any
N –point or, to be more precise, any N –scale distribution
of the velocity increment, is encoded in the conditional
r0).
pdf p(u, r
Furthermore, it is well known that for Markovian pro-
cesses the evolution of p(u, r

the Kramers–Moyal–expansion [12]. For turbulent data

By multiplication with p(u0, r0) and integration with re-
spect to u0, it can be shown that the single scale pdf
p(u, r) obeys the same equation.

(cid:17)

Another important feature of the Markov analysis is
the fact that the coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2) (drift and
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, respectively) can be extracted from
experimental data in a parameter free way by their math-
ematical deﬁnition, see [12,13]:

The conditional moments M (k)(u, r, ∆r) can easily be
calculated from experimental data. Approximating the
limit ∆r
0 in equation (5) by linear extrapolation then
yields estimates for the D(k)(u, r).

As a next point, we focus on the analysis of experi-
mental data measured in a cryogenic axisymmetric he-
lium gas jet at Reynolds numbers ranging from 8500 to
107 samples of the lo-
757000. Each data set contains 1.6
cal velocity measured in the center of the jet in a vertical
distance of 40D from the nozzle using a selfmade hotwire
anemometer (D = 2mm is the diameter of the nozzle).

Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen turbulence was used to con-
vert time lags into spatial displacements. Following the
convention chosen in [11], the velocity increments for each
data set are given in units of σL = √2σ, where σ is the
standard deviation of the velocity ﬂuctuations of the re-
spective data set.

In order to check consistency of the data with com-
monly accepted features of fully developed turbulence, we
calculated the dependence of the Taylor–scale Reynolds
number Rλ on the nozzle-based Reynolds number. Fig-
ure 1 shows that Rλ scales like the square root of Re,
in accordance with theoretical considerations and earlier
experimental results. Further details on the experimental
setup can be found in [15].

the determination see [11]) as a function of the nozzle-based
Reynolds number Re. Dotted line: Rλ = 1.35√Re.

The condition (2) for the Markov property was checked
using the method proposed in ref. [11]. For all the data
sets, the Markovian property was found to be valid for
ri larger
scales ri and diﬀerences of scales ∆r = ri+1 −
than the elementary step size lmar, which turned out to
be of the order of magnitude of the Taylor microscale λ
for all Re–numbers investigated.

Having determined the Markov length lmar, the coeﬃ-
cients D(1)(u, r) and D(2)(u, r) can be estimated from the
measured conditional moments M (1) and M (2) according
to equation (5). The extrapolation towards ∆r = 0 was
performed ﬁtting linear functions to the measured M (k)
in the intervall lmar ≤

Figure 2 shows the resulting estimates for the coeﬃ-
cients D(1) and D(2) for the data set at Rλ = 1180 as a
function of the velocity increment at several scales r. The
coeﬃcients exhibit linear and quadratic dependencies on
the velocity increment, respectively:

Equation (7) is found to describe the dependence of the
D(k) on u for all scales r as well as for all Reynolds num-
bers investigated. By ﬁtting the coeﬃcients D(k) accord-
ing to (7), it is thus possible to determine the scale de-
pendence of the coeﬃcients γ, α, δ and β.

eq. (10)), the coeﬃcient β exhibits a strong dependence on the
Reynolds number with a clear tendency towards the limiting
value β∞(r) given by equ. (13) (full line).

These results allow for a statement on the limiting case
of inﬁnite Reynolds numbers, Re
. According to eq.
(9) the coeﬃcients α and δ tend to zero [17]. γ(r) does
not depend on Re. Thus drift- and diﬀusion coeﬃcient

Based on this limiting result we discuss next implications
for the structure functions Sn

tion of the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation (4) for
p(u, r) with un from left and successively integrating with
respect to u, the equation

According to Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfth law, cf. [1], the
u(r), is proportional to

third order structure function, S3

r. Thus, for n = 3, the left side of eq. (12) is equal to
1/3 and β∞(r) is given by:

(13)

For increasing Reynolds numbers, the experimental re-
sults for β(r) in fact show a tendency towards the lim-
iting value β∞ as given by eq. (13) (see ﬁg. 4), but it
is also clearly observed that the convergence is slow and
that even the highest accessible Reynolds numbers are
still far from this limiting case.

To summarize, the mathematical framework of Markov
processes can succesfully be applied to characterize
the stochastic behaviour of turbulence with increasing
Reynolds number. Moreover, the description obtained by
our method is complete in the sense that the entire infor-
mation about the stochastic process, i.e. the information
about any N –scale pdf p(u1, r1; u2, r2; ...; uN , rN ), is en-
coded in the two coeﬃcients D(1)(u, r) and D(2)(u, r),
for which we ﬁnd rather simple dependencies on their
arguments u, r and the Reynolds number.

The Re–dependence of the coeﬃcients, especially of
D(2), yields strong experimental evidence for a signiﬁ-
cant change of the stochastic process as the Reynolds
number increases. This ﬁnding clearly contradicts the
concept of a universal turbulent cascade and might also
be of importance in large eddy simulations where the in-
ﬂuence of the subgrid stress on the large scale dynamics
of a turbulent ﬂow is modeled under the assumption of
universality.

It is easily veriﬁed that, according to eq. (12), the in-
crease of β(r) with Re excludes the simple scaling laws
proposed by Kolmogorov in 1941 [3] even for Re
.
→ ∞
Furthermore, the universal functional dependence of γ(r)
on r (eq. (10)) does not support the recently proposed
1/3 [10,18]. The obvious depen-
constant value of γ
dence of the coeﬃcients γ and β on r also contradicts
the assumption that the structure functions exhibit scal-
ing behaviour for all orders n, as can be derived from eq.
(12).

≈

With the limiting values for the coeﬃcients D(k) as
given by eq.
(11), the stochastic process for inﬁnite
Reynolds numbers corresponds to an inﬁnitely divisible
multiplicativ cascade [19] as proposed in ref. [20]. How-
ever, from the slow convergence of the measured coeﬃ-
cient β(r) towards its limiting value β∞(r), it is obvious
that turbulent data measured in typical laboratory ex-
periments are still far from that special case. It therefore
seems questionable to us whether models on turbulence
established under the assumption of inﬁnite Reynolds
numbers can be tested in real-life experimental situations
at all.

Marangoni instabilities in binary mixtures are di(cid:27)erent from those in pure liquids. In ontrast

to a large amount of experimental work on Marangoni onvetion in pure liquids, suh experiments

in binary mixtures are not available in the literature, to our knowledge. Using binary mixtures

of sodium hloride/water, we have systematially investigated the pattern formation for a set of

substrate temperatures and solute onentrations in an open system. The (cid:29)ow patterns evolve

with time, driven by surfae-tension (cid:29)utuations due to evaporation and the Soret e(cid:27)et, while

the air-liquid interfae does not deform. A shadowgraph method is used to follow the pattern

formation in time. The patterns are mainly omposed of polygons and rolls. The mean pattern

size (cid:28)rst dereases slightly, and then gradually inreases during the evolution. Evaporation a(cid:27)ets

the pattern formation mainly at the early stage and the loal evaporation rate tends to beome

spatially uniform at the (cid:28)lm surfae. The Soret e(cid:27)et beomes important at the later stage and

a(cid:27)ets the mixture for a large mean solute onentration where the Soret number is signi(cid:28)antly

above zero. The strength of onvetion inreases with the initial solute onentration and the

substrate temperature. Our (cid:28)ndings di(cid:27)er from the theoretial preditions in whih evaporation is

INTRODUCTION

When a horizontal pure-liquid thin (cid:28)lm is sandwihed between a warm solid at the

bottom and a ool gas at the top, heat transfer an be used to drive (cid:29)uid (cid:29)ows. At the

liquid-gas interfae, the surfae tension is a funtion of the interfaial temperature, and usu-

ally dereases with temperature. A small temperature perturbation along the (cid:28)lm surfae

may reate surfae-tension inhomogeneities whih in turn trigger (cid:29)uid instabilities. Flows

observed in suh (cid:28)lms are known as Bénard-Marangoni onvetion or surfae-tension-driven

onvetion. Several reent theoretial and experimental studies are relevant here[1, 2, 3, 4℄.

Di(cid:27)ering from thin (cid:28)lms of pure liquids, the instabilities in binary-mixture (cid:28)lms our

beause the surfae tension is a funtion of both temperature and solute onentration

[5, 6, 7, 8, 9℄. Given a vertial temperature gradient aross the (cid:28)lm, the onentration

gradient may then be imposed by an independent soure or generated spontaneously by

the Soret e(cid:27)et [10℄.

If the thermal Marangoni and solutal Marangoni e(cid:27)ets enhane

eah other, a long-wavelength monotoni instability is possible, while if they ompete

with eah other, an osillatory instability may our instead [5, 6, 7, 8, 9℄.

In the past

deade, theoretial work has led to preditions for the linear and nonlinear stages of

instabilities in thin (cid:28)lms of binary mixtures [5, 6, 7, 8, 9℄. By ontrast, experiments with

surfae-tension-driven instabilities in binary mixtures are not available in the literature,

to our knowledge. The lak of suh experiments has motivated us to investigate pattern

formation for binary mixtures in thin (cid:28)lms.

II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS AND PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM

The governing equations of the system, inluding the Soret e(cid:27)et are: [7, 9℄

∇ · ~v = 0,

∂t~v + (~v · ∇)~v = −ρ−1∇p + ν∇2~v − ~g,

∂tT + (~v · ∇)T = κ∇2T,

∂tc + (~v · ∇)c = D(∇2c + α∇2T ).

Here t is time, ~v , p, ρ, ν and ~g denote the (cid:29)uid veloity (cid:28)eld, pressure, density, kinemati

visosity, and gravitational aeleration, respetively, T and κ represent the temperature

and thermal di(cid:27)usivity of the (cid:29)uid, respetively, c is the onentration of the solute, D is

mass di(cid:27)usivity of the solute, and α is the Soret oe(cid:30)ient.

In Eq. (3), the heat (cid:29)ux indued by the onentration gradient, known as the Dufour

e(cid:27)et, is usually very weak in liquids, and thus negleted. At the solid-liquid interfae, z = 0,

~v satis(cid:28)es the no-slip, no-penetration ondition ~v = 0, the temperature is (cid:28)xed T = Tw , and

the mass (cid:29)ux vanishes, cz + αTz = 0. Here, the wafer temperature Tw is onstant. At a

nondeformable liquid-air interfae, z = h(t), the boundary onditions are given by [11℄. The

heat and mass (cid:29)ux balanes as well as those for the normal and tangential stresses read,

respetively,

kT Tz + q(T − Ta) + jL = 0,

−ρD(cz + αTz) + jc = 0,

Here, kT is the thermal ondutivity of the liquid, ~u is the two-dimensional pro jetion of ~v

ooling, Ta is the onstant room temperature, j is the evaporative mass (cid:29)ux, µ is the liquid

visosity, ρv is the vapor density, and L is the latent heat of evaporation. Also, we have

assumed that the surfae tension σ is a linear funtion of temperature T and onentration

c; hene, σ(T, c) = σ0 − σT (T − T0) + σc(c − c0). Here, σ0 is the referene surfae tension at

Ref. [12℄.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM

Before arrying out an experiment, the (cid:28)rst important issue to be resolved is the seletion

of a resonably non-volatile working liquid, i.e. a binary liquid. We explored a wide range

of andidate materials. We (cid:28)rst tried a mixture of ethanol/water and then abandoned it

due to the fast evaporation of ethanol. We also tested di(cid:27)erent ombinations of silione

oils with notieable di(cid:27)erenes in surfae tension between them to avoid non-misibility.

Only a few silione oils satisfying the requirements of non-volatility and misibility are

ommerially available and are a(cid:27)ordable. However, for all the possible pairs of oils, either

one or both are highly volatile at room temperature or they are highly visous at low

temperature and volatile when heated. The volatilities are typially muh larger than that

of pure water. As a onsequene, we did not hoose binary mixtures of silione oils for our

experiments. After muh trial and error, we hose solutions of sodium hloride (NaCl) with

pure water as the working binary mixtures. There is an additional advantage in hoosing

the mixture of NaCl/water as a working liquid beause its many physiohemial properties

are available in the literature, inluding surfae tension as a funtion of both onentration

and temperature [13℄, and the variation of the Soret oe(cid:30)ient with temperature and

onentration[12℄ among others. The evaporation of water is signi(cid:28)antly weaker than

that of other strongly volatile liquids, so that there is a reasonably long time to take

measurements before the (cid:28)lm dries out ompletely. Finally, the onvetive patterns are

readily visible a short time after a thin (cid:28)lm is drawn.

Figure 1 presents a sketh of the experimental setup of the system. The (cid:28)lm was prepared

on top of a silion wafer with a irular Plexiglas ring (about 7 cm in diameter) as the lateral

boundary. The wafer was bonded to an Aluminum disk attahed to a thin opper plate. A

opper tubing oil was soldered to the bottom of the latter. The two ends of the oil were

onneted to a water bath (Neslab RTE-221) using thermally insulated plasti tubing. The

4

temperature of the plate was held onstant by water irulation. To further redue the heat

loss, the whole opper plate was overed by thermally insulating foam materials, leaving

only a irular hole to hold the Aluminum disk. The (cid:28)lm was diretly exposed to the room

air whose temperature is approximately onstant during the ourse of an experiment. The

(cid:29)utuation in the room air is ±0.5 oC , equivalent to ∼ 0.5 × B oC ≈ 3 mK of the (cid:28)lm

temperature stability. The temperature (cid:29)utuation of the wafer was a(cid:27)eted by several

soures. The (cid:28)rst soure is the thermal (cid:29)utuation of the Neslab water bath whih does not

exeed 10 mK . The seond soure is the temperature (cid:29)utuation at the liquid-air interfae.

To further redue the thermal (cid:29)utuation at the silion wafer, a bridge-ontrolled heating

method was applied[14℄. The wafer temperature was measured by a thermistor embedded

underneath whih was measured with an AC bridge. An o(cid:27)set of the bridge balane point

drove an integro-di(cid:27)erential feedbak iruit whih, in turn, drove a heater attahed to the

inlet of the tubing that arried the ooling water. In suh a way, the thermal (cid:29)utuation

of the wafer was further redued. Depending on the mean temperature of the (cid:28)lm, the

long-time thermal (cid:29)utuations of the wafer temperature are less than 30 mK at the mean
temperature of the (cid:28)lm Tf ≡ Tw − 1
2 △ T ≈ 30 oC and less than 15 mK at Tf ≈ 25 oC . The
mean temperature drop aross the (cid:28)lm △T is typially less than 1 oC .

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 2 shows a set of typial shadowgraph (cid:29)ow patterns observed in thin (cid:28)lms of

NaCl/water mixtures with an initial NaCl onentration of 4 M/l. In this (cid:28)gure, bright and

dark shades represent downward and upward (cid:29)ows, respetively. In omparison with the

standard Marangoni onvetion in pure liquids (MCP), these patterns are very irregular

and evolve with time. Following the (cid:28)lm deposition, an irregular pattern emerges, as seen

in Fig. 2(a). This is a transient proess with patterns gradually dereasing in size (Fig.

2(b)). Eventually small-sale patterns over the entire system, as shown in Fig. 2(). The

ma jority of the patterns are roll-like strutures, although there are also loalized dots, whih

are rarely observed in MCP. These small-sale patterns persist for a period of time before

any qualitative hanges appear. Then, the harateristi sale of the pattern beomes larger

and the patterns onsist primarily of polygons, as shown in Fig. 2(d-f ). If the onentration

5

of NaCl exeeds the maximal solubility (≈ 8 M/l), salt begins to rystallize out of the

solution; small islands of salt appear as blak dots, as in Fig. 2(g-i). An interesting aspet

of the system evolution onerns the (cid:28)lm thikness.

Interferometri measurements show

that exept at the menisus boundary, the (cid:28)lm thikness remains horizontally uniform

during the evolution preeding the formation of salt rystals when deformation of the (cid:28)lm

interfae beomes signi(cid:28)ant.

To quantify the time variation of the pattern size, we apply fast Fourier transforms (FFT)

to the original shadowgraph images after the removal of the bakground intensity variation.

The images in the Fourier spae were averaged over phase angles. From the FFT spetrum,

we alulate both the mean wavenumber and its standard deviation. The results are then

onverted to a real spae pattern size, s(t), as presented in Fig. 3(a). We normalize this

harateristi pattern size by its instantaneous (cid:28)lm thikness, whih we refer to hereafter

as the normalized pattern size.

Immediately after the (cid:28)lm is initialized, the normalized

pattern size is approximately 0.8, i.e. the average pattern size is slightly below the value

of the (cid:28)lm thikness. For some time thereafter, the patterns are rolls, as seen in Fig.

2(). The normalized pattern size also retains its initial value for a onsiderable time, and

then gradually inreases. Due to evaporation, the (cid:28)lm thikness dereases monotonially.

Beause the Marangoni number is proportional to the (cid:28)lm thikness, it too ontinuously

dereases. Finally, the average normalized pattern size reahes s/h ≃ 3.0. At this point,

the orresponding pattern onsists mainly of non-equilateral polygons. The irregular shape

of these polygons leads to large errors in determining the pattern size, Fig. 3. This feature

is di(cid:27)erent from the lassial MCP where patterns are regular polygons [1, 15℄. This

di(cid:27)erene may be aused by one or a ombination of several soures. First, there is the fat

that the surfae onditions in the MCP are usually preisely ontrolled, as ompared to the

present open system, for whih a preise ontrol of the air layer above the (cid:28)lm surfae is

muh more di(cid:30)ult. Alternatively, we note that the Marangoni number is ever hanging,

and it is impossible to tune the value of the Marangoni number exatly at the threshold value.

Towards the later stages of the pattern evolution, a notieable di(cid:27)erene in the pattern

ours as relatively linear rolls give way to polygonal patterns. At that point, the Marangoni

number is 539 ± 29, whih is quite big ompared with the threshold values derived in

6

non-evaporative (cid:28)lms [5, 6℄, and the (cid:28)lm thikness was about 0.9 mm. We also arried

out an experiment with an initial (cid:28)lm thikness of 0.87 mm, whih is lose to the value

mentioned above. At this initial (cid:28)lm thikness, the onvetion starts from polygons and the

pattern intensity deays with time until the onvetion pattern vanishes. The magnitude of

the pattern intensity, I(t), as a funtion of time is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3(a). I(t) is

alulated from the average intensity of the image after the removal of the bakground. A

large Marangoni number was also observed in an experiment using pure liquid (cid:28)lms with

strong evaporation [16℄. However, no patterns were observed in pure water (cid:28)lms in our

system. This suggests the solutal e(cid:27)ets (thermal solutal and Soret e(cid:27)et) are important.

This also leads us to the onjeture that a onsiderable part of the temperature drop

aross the (cid:28)lm may atually our spatially uniformly at the (cid:28)lm surfae. This is beause

evaporation an reate a large temperature drop aross the (cid:28)lm due to the latent heat loss.

The rest of the temperature drop aross the (cid:28)lm is responsible for the (cid:29)uid instabilities

at the (cid:28)lm surfae.

Indeed, we estimate that as muh as 95% of the temperature drop

aross the (cid:29)uid may our at the surfae. Note that Fig. 3 does not show the data points

where the rystallization of NaCl (blak dots) takes plae at the (cid:28)lm surfae, as seen in

Fig. 2(g-i). The existene of the solid phase hanges the (cid:29)ow pattern dramatially. Solid

NaCl an grow and merge with a deformable (cid:29)uid interfae. The physis of this stage has

not yet been well understood and is outside the sope of this work.

Figure 3(b) shows the time evolution of the normalized pattern size at a di(cid:27)erent

temperature, Tf = 25 oC . While the qualitative features are similar to Fig. 3(a), there are

still some quantitative di(cid:27)erenes. The normalized pattern size at the early stage is around

1.0 whih is larger than 0.8 at Tf = 30 oC . In the beginning of eah run (see e.g. irles and

diamonds), the normalized pattern size usually dereases for the initial 10 ∼ 20 min. This

feature exists in some of the other runs in (cid:28)gure (a) or (b), exept it is more visible here.

We note that typially, after the (cid:28)lm is deposited, patterns generally appear at a slightly

bigger size; they then gradually derease in size by developing smaller sale onvetion

polygons or rolls suh as those in Fig. 2(a-).

Figure 3 does not present the normalized pattern-size variation for (cid:28)lms with low

onentrations where the onvetion (cid:29)ows are weaker and onvetion deays rapidly. For

7

instane, in Fig. 4(a) the patterns are readily seen at time t = 2.1 min; they are very

weak if not ompletely gone in (b) at t = 47.5 min after the (cid:28)lm is deposited. Similar

observations were seen for initial onentrations c0 ≤ 0.8 M/l. The deay of the pattern is

an indiation that the loal evaporation (cid:29)ux has a tendeny to beome spatially uniform

with time.

It is reasonable to believe that the evaporation rate, and hene this e(cid:27)et,

should be independent of onentration. For higher onentrations, however, the patterns

persist and the intensity tends to be more uniform during the evolution. One possibility is

that this di(cid:27)erene is related to the Soret oe(cid:30)ient, as determined, for instane, from data

for NaCl/water mixtures by Gaeta et al.[12℄ At T = 30 oC , the Soret oe(cid:30)ient is α ≃ 0 at
c = 0.2 M/l and linearly inreases as log(c) to α = 1.5 × 10−3/0C at c = 2 M/l. We estimate

the orresponding Soret number to be χ = 0.04 for c = 2 M/l and χ = 0.10 for c = 4 M/l.

The harateristi time for mass di(cid:27)usion, about 40 min for a 2 mm thik (cid:28)lm, is roughly

the same as in Fig 4. This suggests that the Soret e(cid:27)et beomes important at the later

stage of onvetion.

In Fig. 4(b), the value χ ≈ 0.002 is too small to drive onvetion

after the pattern reated by evaporation begins fading away. Thus, in order for the Soret

e(cid:27)et to play a role, a su(cid:30)iently large onentration leading to a higher Soret di(cid:27)usion

is neessary sine the solutal Marangoni e(cid:27)et is diretly proportional to the Soret number χ.

In our experiments we have measured the instantaneous thikness of the (cid:28)lm over

extended periods of time. Using the time history we then evaluate the evaporation rate as a

funtion of time. We (cid:28)nd that this quantity is nearly onstant at a given (cid:28)lm temperature

Tf and a room temperature Ta . Considering that the mean onentration inreases with

time, the linear plot for h(t), as seen in the Fig. 5(a), implies a very weak onentration

dependene on the evaporation rate. The slope of h(t) vs.

t inreases for a larger (cid:28)lm

temperature Tf or a smaller room temperature Ta . The linear derease of the (cid:28)lm thikness

due to evaporation seems to be robust and almost independent of the NaCl onentration.

As a omparison, the measurements of the (cid:28)lm thikness for evaporating pure-water (cid:28)lms

are also presented in Fig. 5(a). The slope of h(t) for a water (cid:28)lm is also a onstant, in-

diating that this linear behavior is indeed independent of the omposition of the liquid (cid:28)lm.

This result is di(cid:27)erent from the analytial solution obtained by Burelbah et al. [17℄ and

8

Oron et al.[11℄ for the base state of an evaporating (cid:28)lm of a uniform thikness

h(t) = h0[q(K + 1)2 − 2Et − K],

(12)

where h0 is the initial (cid:28)lm thikness, K is a onstant interfaial resistane to phase hange

and E is the evaporation onstant. If Et ≪ 1, h(t) would be nearly linear. However, as

Et grows, h(t) would start to bend downwards, espeially at small h(t). This trend is not

seen in the present data. We have experimentally ruled out the possibility that onvetive

air motion above the (cid:28)lm might be responsible, sine the theory assumes that the air layer

is at rest. In partiular, experimental measurements of the evaporation rate for a (cid:28)lm at

a temperature lower than the room air are also presented in the inset of Fig. 5(a) shown

by the triangle-left symbols; they too show a linear variation. We believe that the reason

for the disrepany between theory and experiment is aused by the large fration of the

temperature di(cid:27)erene that ours at the liquid-air interfae. Beause this temperature

di(cid:27)erene remains nearly onstant, the evaporation rate also remains onstant. Hene, the

boundary ondition used in reent theoretial work di(cid:27)ers from that whih applies for these

experiments.

Keeping other onditions the same, the magnitude of the onvetion, as determined

based on the average intensity of the shadowgraph images reorded over the (cid:28)rst 15 minutes

after the (cid:28)lm was initialized, depends on the initial onentration c0 of NaCl and the (cid:28)lm's

mean temperature. At low onentrations, c0 ≤ 0.1 M/l, there are no visible onvetion

patterns even for a 2.2 mm thik (cid:28)lm. This implies that buoyany is irrelevant in our

system if we assume that the thermal expansion of the (cid:29)uid is not signi(cid:28)antly a(cid:27)eted

by adding NaCl to the pure water. When the onentration c0 is higher than 0.2 M/l,

the patterns gradually appear. This observation suggests that thermal Marangoni alone

annot drive the (cid:29)uid instability and that the (cid:29)uid motion is driven by the ombination of

thermal Marangoni and solutal Marangoni e(cid:27)ets. The magnitude inreases monotonially

with onentration for c0 ≥ 0.2 M/l. At a (cid:28)xed (cid:28)lm temperature of 30 oC , the Soret

oe(cid:30)ient is negative in the onentration range 0.042 M/l ≤ c0 ≤ 0.13 M/l[12℄. How-

ever, in suh a range, the onentration is too low to observe any realisti motions in the (cid:28)lm.

V. SUMMARY

To summarize, we have experimentally studied transient Marangoni onvetion in thin

binary-mixture liquid (cid:28)lms using solutions of NaCl/water in an open system. In the pres-

ene of evaporation, the patterns, onsisting of rolls and polygons, evolve with time. The

length sale of the pattern inreases with time until the onvetion eases. The Marangoni

numbers near onset are muh larger than the values predited in theories developed for

non-volatile binary liquids. Evaporation is important to the pattern formation at the early

stage, while the Soret e(cid:27)et is essential at the later stage. For higher onentrations of

NaCl, the onvetion beomes stronger. Within the temperature range 25 oC ≤ Tf ≤ 30 oC

explored in the experiment, onvetion patterns were observed in the NaCl onentration

range 0.2 M/l ≤ c0 ≤ 5 M/l. Understanding the rih pattern forming dynamis learly

requires new theoretial work.

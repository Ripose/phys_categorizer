Abstract

The nolinear hydrodynamic equations of the surface of a liquid drop are

shown to be directly connected to Korteweg de Vries (KdV, MKdV) systems,

giving traveling solutions that are cnoidal waves. They generate multiscale

patterns ranging from small harmonic oscillations (linearized model), to non-

linear oscillations, up through solitary waves. These non-axis-symmetric lo-

calized shapes are also described by a KdV Hamiltonian system. Recently

such “rotons” were observed experimentally when the shape oscillations of a

droplet became nonlinear. The results apply to drop-like systems from cluster

formation to stellar models, including hyperdeformed nuclei and ﬁssion.

A fundamental understanding of non-linear oscillations of a liquid drop (NLD), which

reveals new phenomena and ﬂows more complicated than linear theory suggests, is needed in

diverse areas of science and technology. Besides their direct use in rheological and surfactant

theory [1–7], such models apply to cluster physics [8], super- and hyper-deformed nuclei [1],

nuclear break-up and ﬁssion [2,3,8], thin ﬁlms [9], radar [4] and even stellar masses and

supernova [1,10]. Theoretical approaches are usually based on numerical calculations within

diﬀerent NLD models, [2–4] and explain/predict axis-symmetric, non-linear oscillations that

are in very good agreement with experiment [1,5–7]. However, there are experimental results

which show non-axis-symmetric modes; for example, traveling rotational shapes [5,6] that

can lead to ﬁssion, cluster emission, or fusion [5–7].

In this letter the existence of analytic solutions of NLD models that give rise to traveling

solutions which are solitary waves is proven. Higher order non-linear terms in the devi-

ation of the shape from a sphere produce surface oscillations that are cnoidal waves [11].

By increasing the amplitude of these oscillations, the non-linear contribution grows and

the drop’s surface, under special conditions (non-zero angular momentum), can transform

from a cnodial wave form into a solitary wave. This same evolution can occur if there is

a non-linear coupling between the normal modes. Thus this approach leads to a unifying

dynamical picture of such modes; speciﬁcally, the cnoidal solution simulates harmonic os-

cillations developing into anharmonic ones, and under special circumstances these cnoidal

wave forms develop into solitary waves. Of course, in the linear limit the theory reproduces

the normal modes of oscillation of a surface.

Two approaches are used: Euler equations [2,3], and Hamiltonian equations, which de-

scribe the total energy of the system [2]. We investigate ﬁnite amplitude waves, for which

the relative amplitude is smaller than the angular half-width. These excitations are also

“long” waves, important in the cases of externally driven systems, where the excited wave-

length depends by the driving frequency. The ﬁrst original observations of travelling waves

on liquid drops are described in [5]. Similar travelling or running waves are also discussed or

quoted in [2,6]. These results suggest that higher amplitude non-linear oscillations can lead

2

to a traveling wave that originates on the drop’s surface and developes towards the interior.

This is shown to be related in a simply way to special solitary wave solutions, called “rotons”

in the present analysis. Recent experiments and numerical tests [8,12] suggest the existence

of stable traveling waves for a non-linear dynamics in a circular geometry, re-enforcing the

theory.

A new NLD model for describing an ideal, incompressible ﬂuid drop exercising irrota-

tional ﬂow with surface tension, is employed in the analysis. Series expansion in terms of

spherical harmonics are replaced by localized, nonlinear shapes shown to be analytic solu-

tions of the system. The ﬂow is potential and therefore governed by Laplace’s equation for

the potential ﬂow, △Φ = 0, while the dynamics is described by Euler’s equation,

ρ(∂t~v + (~v · ∇)~v) = −∇P + ~f,

(1)

where P is pressure. If the density of the external force ﬁeld is also potential, ~f = −∇Ψ
where Ψ is proportional to the potential (gravitational, electrostatic, etc.), then Eq. (1)

reduces to Bernoulli’s scalar equation. The boundary conditions (BC) on the external free

˙θ +
surface of the drop, Σ1, and on the inner surface Σ2, [2,3,11], are ˙r|Σ1 = (rt + rθ
˙φ)|Σ1 and ˙r|Σ2 = 0, respectively. Φr = ˙r is the radial velocity, Φθ = r2 ˙θ, Φφ = r2 sin θ ˙φ
rφ
are the tangential velocities. The second BC occurs only in the case of ﬂuid shells or

bubbles. A convenient geometry places the origin at the center-of-mass of the distributon

r(θ, φ, t) = R0[1 + g(θ)η(φ − V t)] and introduces for the dimensionless shape function gη a
variable denoted ξ. Here R0 is the radius of the undeformed spherical drop and V is the

tangential velocity of the traveling solution ξ moving in the φ direction and having a constant

transversal proﬁle g in the θ direction. The linearized form of the ﬁrst BC,

˙r|Σ1 = rt|Σ1,
allows only radial vibrations and no tangential motion of the ﬂuid on Σ1, [2,3,11]. The second

BC restricts the radial ﬂow to a spherical layer of depth h(θ) by requiring Φr|r=R0−h = 0.
This condition stratiﬁes the ﬂow in the surface layer, R0 − h ≤ r ≤ R0(1 + ξ), and the
liquid bulk r ≤ R0 − h. In what follows the ﬂow in the bulk will be considered negligible
compared to the ﬂow in the surface layer. This condition does not restrict the generality of

3

the argument because h can always be taken to be R0. Nonetheless, keeping h < R0 opens

possibilities for the investigation of more complex ﬂuids, e.g. superﬂuids, ﬂow over a rigid

core, multilayer systems [2,7] or multiphases, etc. Instead of an expansion of Φ in term of

spherical harmonics, consider the following form

∞

Φ =

(r/R0 − 1)nfn(θ, φ, t).

Xn=0

(2)

The convergence of the series is controlled by the value of the small quantity ǫ = max| r−R0
R0 |,
[11]. The condition max|h/R0| ≃ ǫ is also assumed to hold in the following development.
Laplace’s equation introduces a system of recursion relations for the functions fn, f2 =

−f1 −△Ωf0/2, etc., where △Ω is the (θ, φ) part of the Laplacean. Hence the set of unknown
fn’s reduces to f0 and f1. The second BC, plus the condition ξφ = −V ξt, for traveling waves,
yields to second order in ǫ,

f0,φ = V R3

0 sin2 θξ(1 + 2ξ)/h + O3(ξ),

(3)

i.e., a connection between the ﬂow potential and the shape, which is typical of nonlinear

systems. Eq.(3) together with the relations f1 ≃ R2
the BC and recursion, characterize the ﬂow as a function of the surface geometry. The

balance of the dynamic and capillary pressure across the surface Σ1 follows by expanding

up to third order in ξ the square root of the surface energy of the drop [2,3,11],

(4)

and by equating its ﬁrst variation with the local mean curvature of Σ1 under the restriction

of the volume conservation. The surface pressure, in third order, reads

P|Σ1 =

(5)

where σ is the surface pressure coeﬃcient and the terms ξφ,θ, ξφ,φ and ξθ,θ are neglected

because the relative amplitude of the deformation ǫ is smaller than the angular half-width

L, ξ = ξφφ ≃ ǫ2/L2 ≪ 1, as most of the experiments [6,7,9,12] concerning traveling surface
patterns show. Eq.(5) plus the BC yield, to second order in ǫ,

The linearized version of Eq. (6) together with the linearized BC, Φr|Σ1 = R0ξt, yield a
limiting case of the model, namely, the normal modes of oscillation of a liquid drop with

spherical harmonic solutions [2,3]. Diﬀerentiation of Eq. (6) with respect to φ together with

Eqs.(3,5) yields the dynamical equation for the evolution of the shape function η(φ − V t):

In the case of a two-dimensional liquid drop, the coeﬃcients in Eq. (8) are all constant.

Eq. (7) has traveling wave solutions in the φ direction if Cg/(B − AV ) and D/(B − AV )
do not depend on θ. These two conditions introduce two diﬀerential equations for g(θ)

and h(θ) which can be solved with the boundary conditions g = h = 0 for θ = 0, π. For

example, h1 = R0 sin2 θ and g1 = P 2

2 (θ) is a particular solution which is valid for h ≪ R0. It
represents a soliton with a quadrupole transvere proﬁle, being in good agreement with [2,6].

The next higher order term in Eq. (6), −3ξ2ξθctgθ, introduces a η2ηφ nonlinear term into
the dynamics and transforms the KdV equation into the modiﬁed KdV equation [11]. The

traveling wave solutions of Eq. (7) are then described by the Jacobi elliptic function [11]

η = α3 + (α2 − α3)sn2(cid:18)s C(α3 − α2)

12D

(φ − V t); m(cid:19),

(9)

where the αi are the constants of integration introduced through Eq. (7) and are related

through the velocity V = C(α1 + α2 + α3)/3A + B/A and m2 = α3−α2
α3−α1

. m ∈ [0, 1] is the
free parameter of the elliptic sn function. This result for Eq. (9) is known as a cnoidal wave

5

solution with angular period T = K[m]qC(α3 − α1)/3D where K(m) is the Jacobi elliptic
integral. If α2 → α1 → 0, then m → 1, T → ∞ and a one-parameter (η0) family of traveling
pulses (solitons or anti-solitons) is obtained,

ηsol = η0sech2[(φ − V t)/L],

(10)

with velocity V = η0C/3A + B/A and angular half-width L = q12D/Cη0. Taking for the

coeﬃcients A to D the values given in Eq.(8) for θ = π/2 (the equatorial cross section)

and h1, g1 from above, one can calculate numerical values of the parameters of any roton

excitation function of η0 only.

The soliton, among other wave patterns, has a special shape-kinematic dependence η0 ≃
V ≃ 1/L; a higher soliton is narrower and travels faster. This relation can be used to
experimentally distinguish solitons from other modes or turbulence. When a layer thins

(h → 0) the coeﬃcient C in eq.(8) approaches zero on average, producing a break in the
traveling wave solution (L becomes singular) because of the change of sign under the square

root, eq.(9). Such wave turbulence from capillary waves on thin shells was ﬁrst observed

in [9]. For the water shells described there, eq.(8) gives h(µm) ≤ 20ν/k, that is h=15-
25µm at V =2.1-2.5ms−1 for the onset of wave turbulence, in good agreement with the

abrupt transition experimentaly noticed. The cnoidal solutions provide the nonlinear wave

interaction and the transition from competing linear wave modes (C ≤ 0) to turbulence
(C ≃ 0). In the KdV eq.(7), the nonlinear interaction balances or even dominates the linear
damping and the cnoidal (roton) mode occurs as a bend mode (h small and coherent traveling

proﬁle) in agreement with [9]. The condition for the existence of a positive amplitude soliton

is gCD ≥ 0 which, for g ≤ 0, limits the velocity from below to the value V ≥ hω2/R0 where
ω2 is the Lamb frequency for the λ = 2 linear mode [2,3]. This inequality can be related

to the “independent running wave” described in [6], which lies close to the λ = 2 mode.

Moreover, since the angular group velocity of the (λ, µ) normal mode, Vλ,µ = ωλ/µ, has

practically the same value for λ = 2 (µ = 0,±1, tesseral harmonics) and for λ = µ, any
λ (sectorial harmonics) this inequality seems to be essential for any combination of rank 2

6

tesseral or sectorial harmonics, in good agreement with the conclusions in [2]. The periodic

limit of the cnoidal wave is reached for m ≃ 0, that is, α2 − α3 ≃ 0, and the shape is
characterized by harmonic oscillations (sn → sin in Eq. (9)) which realize the quadrupole
mode of a linear theory Y µ

2 limit [2,3] or the oscillations of tesseral harmonics [2], Fig. 1.

The NLD model introduced in this paper yields a smooth transition from linear oscilla-

tions to solitary traveling solutions (“rotons”) as a function of the parameters αi; namely,

a transition from periodic to non-periodic shape oscillations. In between these limits the

surface is described by nonlinear cnoidal waves. In Fig.1 the transition from a periodic limit

to a solitary wave is shown, in comparison with the corresponding normal modes which can

initiate such cnoidal nonlinear behavior. This situation is similar to the transformation of

the ﬂow ﬁeld from periodic modes at small amplitude to traveling waves at larger amplitude

[2,6]. The solution goes into a ﬁnal form if the volume conservation restriction is enforced:

RΣ(1 + g(θ)η(φ, t))3dΩ = 4π and requires η(φ, t) to be periodic. The periodicity condition,
nK[(α3 − α2)/(α3 − α1)] = π√α3 − α1 for any positive integer n, is only fulﬁlled for a ﬁnite

number of n values, and hence a ﬁnite number of coresponding cnoidal modes. In the roton

limit the periodicity condition becomes a quasi-periodic one because the amplitude decays

rapidly. This approach could be extended to describe elastic modes of surface as well as

their nonlinear coupling to capillary waves. The double-periodic structure of the elliptic

solutions [11] could describe the new family of normal wave modes predicted in [4].

The development up to this point was based on Euler’s equation. The same result

will now be shown to emerge from a Hamiltonian analysis of the NLD system. Recently,

Natarajan and Brown [2] showed that the NLD is a Lagrangian system with the volume con-

servation condition being a Lagrange multiplier. In the third order deviation from spherical,

the NLD becomes a KdV inﬁnite-dimensional Hamiltonian system described by a nonlin-

ear Hamiltonian function H = R 2π

0 Hdφ. In the linear approximation, the NLD is a linear
wave Hamiltonian system [2,3]. If terms depending on θ are absorbed into deﬁnite integrals

(becoming parameters) the total energy is a function of η only. Taking the kinetic energy

from [2,3], Φ from Eq. (2) and using the BC, the dependence of the kinetic energy on the

7

tangential velocity along θ direction, Φθ, becomes negligible and the kinetic energy can be

expressed as a T [η] functional. For traveling wave solutions ∂t = −V ∂φ, to third order in ǫ,
after a tedious but feasible calculus, the total energy is:

(12)

Since for the function η(φ − V t) the LHS of Eq.(12) is zero, the integrand in the RHS gives
the KdV equation. Hence, the energy of the NLD model, in the third order, is interpreted as

a Hamiltonian of the KdV equation [7,11]. This is in full agreement with the result ﬁnalized

by Eq. (7) for an appropriate choice of the parameters and the Cauchy conditions for g, h.

The dependence of E(α1, α2)|V ol=constant, Eq.(11), shows an energy minimum in which the
solitary waves are stable, [12].

The nonlinear coupling of modes in the cnoidal solution could explain the occurence of

many resonances for the l = 2 mode of rotating liquid drops, at a given (higher) angular

velocity, [13]. The rotating quadrupole shape is close to the soliton limit of the cnoidal wave.

On one hand, the existence of many resonances is a consequence of by the multi-valley proﬁle

of the eﬀective potential energy for the KdV, (MKdV) equation: η2

x = aη + bη2 + cη3 + (dη4),

[11]. The frequency shift predicted by Busse in [13] can be reproduced in the present theory

by choosing the solution h1 = R0sinθ/2. It results the same additional pressure drop in the

form of V 2ρR2

0sin2θ/2 like in [13], and hence a similar result. For a roton emerged from a l =

2 mode, by calculating the half-width (L2) and amplitude (ηmax,2) which ﬁtt the quadrupole

8

shape it results a law for the frequency shift: ∆ω2/ω2 = (1 ± 4L2(α3 − α2)/3R0)−1V /ω2,
showing a good agreement with the observations of Annamalai et al in [13], i.e. many

resonances and nonlinear dependence of the shift on Ω = V . The special damping of the

l = 2 mode for rotating drops could also be a consequence of the existence of the cnoidal

solution. An increasing in the velocity V produces a modiﬁcation of the balance of the

coeﬃcients C/D which is equivalent with an increasing in dispersion.

The model introduced in this article proves that traveling analytic solutions exist as

cnoidal waves on the surface of a liquid drop. These traveling deformations (“rotons”) can

range from small oscillations (normal modes), to cnoidal oscillations, and on out to solitary

waves. The same approach can be applied to bubbles as well, except that the boundary

condition on Σ2 is replaced by a far-ﬁeld condition [2,3] (recently important in the context

of single bubble sonoluminiscence). Nonlinear phenomena can not be fully investigated with

normal linear tools, e.g. spherical harmonics. Using analytic non-linear solutions sacriﬁces

the linearity of the space but replaces it with multiscale dynamical behavior, typical for non-

linear systems (solitons, wavelets, compactons [12]). They can be applied to phenomena like

cluster formation in nuclei, fragmentation or cold ﬁssion, the dynamics of the pellet surface

in inertial fusion, stellar models, and so forth.

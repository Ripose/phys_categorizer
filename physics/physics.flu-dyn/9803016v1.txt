We consider the design criteria of a chemical mixing device based on a chaotic ﬂow, with an
emphasis on the steady-state devices. The merit of a reactor, deﬁned as the Q-factor, is related to
the physical dimension of the device and the molecular diﬀusivity of the reactants through the local
Lyapunov exponents of the ﬂow. The local Lyapunov exponent can be calculated for any given ﬂow
ﬁeld and it can also be measured in experimental situations. Easy-to-compute formulae are provided
to estimate the Q-factor given either the exact spatial dependence of the local Lyapunov exponent
or its probability distribution function. The requirements for optimization are made precise in the
context of local Lyapunov exponents.

I. INTRODUCTION

A major concern in chemical engineering is to react two or more species to form a new chemical product [1]. To
increase production, one could boost the reaction rate by a catalyst which is an optimization on a microscopic level.
One could also carry the reactants by a ﬂow and maximize the diﬀusive eﬀect that brings the chemicals together
to react. Traditionally the ﬂow is designed to be turbulent to achieve higher mixing eﬀect. Started in the 1980s,
non-turbulent but chaotic ﬂows, are advocated to achieve the same eﬀect with signiﬁcantly less energy consumption in
driving the ﬂow [2,3]. Much work has been done in this area [4–7], but some of the fundamental issues on optimizing
the design still require a clariﬁcation. This paper intends to report some progresses along this line. The emphasis
on the local Lyapunov exponent of the ﬂow and its role in quantitatively determining the physics of both advective
‘mixing’ and diﬀusive transport, is an unique aspect of this investigation.

The typical reaction is a three species event, chemical A reacts with chemical B to form chemical C,

The quantities of interest are the concentrations or number densities of each species, CA, CB, and CC . The concen-
tration of the end product is not independent and can be expressed in terms of the history of CA and CB. If the
chemicals are carried by a ﬂow, the mathematical model for the mixing-reaction process is the advection-diﬀusion-
reaction equation. Written out explicitly for each species, they are

We will assume that the original carrier ﬂow is suﬃciently energetic that the back-reaction of the reaction process on
the background ﬂow is negligible. This assumption decouples the third governing equation, for example, the Navier-
Stokes equation for the ﬂow ﬁeld, from the two coupled advection-diﬀusion-reaction equations (1,2). The principles
for the design optimization, are then found by solving the advection-diﬀusion-reaction equations and identifying the
ﬂow features that crucially aﬀect the production rate and quality.

There are generally two classes of reactors, which we will call a closed ﬂow system and an open ﬂow system. A
canonical closed ﬂow system is a stirred tank [10]. Mathematically it corresponds to an initial value problem, with
simple boundary conditions. The degree of mixing is measured over time. A canonical open ﬂow system is a tubular
device such as an automobile catalytic converter. Raw exhaust gas constantly ﬂows in, the poisonous elements are
removed by chemical reactions, and the treated gas is discharged to the tail pipe. The system is expected to function
in steady state. Mathematically it is a time-independent boundary value problem. The integral form of equations
(3,4) makes the global balance transparent. For an engineering device operating in steady state,

Mathematically that is to say that the reaction is fast so once φ is found, the problem is solved by setting
= f.
Physically it says that two diﬀerent reactants react so fast that they can not coexist at the same point anywhere in
= f (x) = M ax(CA, CB). For
the device. Hence at least one of reactant densities has to vanish locally and
engineering design purposes, the equivalent statement is that the reaction is suﬃciently fast so that the eﬃciency of
the reactor is determined by the eﬃciency of mixing. This is precisely the motivation for embedding the reactants
into a turbulent ﬂow and more recently a chaotic one. We note that the use of a catalyst is intended to boost the
microscopic reaction rate κ.

As expected, the inequality in equation (5) is equivalent to the statement that the Damk¨ohler number is much
greater than the Peclet number. The Peclet number P e is the ratio between the characteristic diﬀusion time L2/D
and the advective time scale L/U. The Damk¨ohler number Da is the ratio between the characteristic diﬀusion time
an average over space. A reaction is fast if the typical reaction
and the typical reaction time 1/κ
time is much shorter than the advective time scale, i.e. Da/P e
1. Although in a closed ﬂow system like a stirred
tank the ratio Da/P e might be less than one, it has to be greater, and usually much greater, than one in a working
steady-state device. This is a trivial statement of the fact that the advective time scale L/U in a steady-state device
is simply the duration for the reactants to stay in the reactor before discharge. It has to be longer than the reaction
time. Otherwise even a perfectly mixed reactants at the inlet will not form much product at the time of discharge.
1 is not diﬃcult to accommodate. For example it can

always be satisﬁed in a tubular device by simply increasing the longitudinal length L. Indeed, the minimum design
constraint of a steady-state chemical reactor is to have the longitudinal Damk¨ohler number greater, or much greater,
than the longitudinal Peclet number. Here longitudinal refers to the streamwise direction.

The ﬂow design is driven by the rate of σ

the relaxation time scale is l2/D. If there is no convection, l is of reactor size and the relaxation time scale l2/D is

Towards a better reactor, the carrier ﬂow must be designed to drive gradients in ϕ or φ, which is an ideal task for
a chaotic ﬂow. In addition, to achieve better quality of the end product, it is desired that the gradients are driven
‘uniformly.’ In the case of a chaotic ﬂow, the size of the KAM islands should be minimized, which is an obvious
direction for optimization. There is another, more subtle, issue concerning the non-uniformity of the chaoticity and
the existence of a barrier to diﬀusion even within the chaotic region. This subtlety can not be resolved by the standard
Poincare section technigue, but it can be made mathematically precise in terms of the ﬁnite time or local Lyapunov
exponents of a ﬂow. The goal of this paper will be to explain how to understand the merit of a reactor by the ﬁnite
time or local Lyapunov exponent of the carrier ﬂow.

Our approach based on the local Lyapunov exponents should be contrasted with the past heavy reliance on the
Poincare section as a diagnostic to measure the extent of mixing, an approach that is prone to misinterpretation and
does not provide any rate information [5]. The limitation of the Poincare section technique was explicitly noted by
Swanson and Ottino in [11], and prominently restated by Bryden and Brenner in [5]. Muzzio and Liu presented a
numerical demonstration in a two dimensional mixing-reaction problem [6]. The local Lyapunov exponent analysis,
in our view, complements the Poincare section by providing the exact rate information and removes the ambiguities
associated with the Poincare plots.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II gives an introduction on how the ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent enters the description of a chaotic ﬂow and the passive scalar transport. Section III brieﬂy describes the
time-dependent solution to the advection-diﬀusion equation, the more detailed analysis can be found in [8] for the
two dimensional case and [9] for the three dimensional case. The main body of the paper, which includes sections
IV V VI VII VIII, deals with the practically attractive steady-state reactors. The main mathematical formulation
has utilized cylindrical geometry and quasi-two-dimensional ﬂows for clarity and convenience, although the most
important concepts and results can be readily generalized. Section IX highlights the main points of the paper.

II. FINITE TIME LYAPUNOV EXPONENT AND A CHAOTIC FLOW

A chaotic ﬂow is characterized by the exponential variations of neighboring streamlines. For example, the separation

between neighboring ﬂuid trajectories of a divergence-free, time-periodic two dimensional ﬂow obeys

otherwise it is said to be integrable. We note that the laminar to turbulent transition is marked by the emergence
of many scales for the velocity ﬁeld. The integrable to non-integrable transition concerns the behavior of the ﬂuid
trajectories, not the spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld. This is why the stochasticity of a chaotic ﬂow is also called
Lagrangian turbulence (Lagrangian trajectories), in analog with the usual Kolmogorov-type Eulerian turbulence
(Eulerian ﬂow ﬁeld). As far as the theory of advection-diﬀusion equation concerns, a qualitative change in the
solution of the equation occurs at the integrable-nonintegrable transition. This should be contrasted with the standard
treatment that presumes a turbulent background ﬂow.

What we mean by a qualitative change in the solution of the advection-diﬀusion equation can be made precise by
the rate at which the gradients of passive scalar ﬁeld grow before the diﬀusive relaxation dominates the solution. In an
integrable ﬂow,
φ increases exponentially
in time. The exponential rate is given by the ﬁnite time or local Lyapunov exponent λ(ξ, t), which depends on both
position and time. That is to say, the value of λ depends on where the ﬁducial trajectory initially starts and how
long one is tracing the ﬁducial trajectory. The time and especially the spatial dependence of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent deﬁne the essential characteristics of the passive scalar transport.

φ grows linearly in time. If the Lagrangian trajectories become chaotic,

∇

∇

The eﬀects of advection and diﬀusion can be most clearly seen in Lagrangian coordinates. The Lagrangian coor-
dinates are deﬁned by a one-to-one mapping between the initial position and the current position of a ﬂuid element,
which is found by integrating

dx(ξ, t)/dt = v(x, t)

with the initial condition x(ξ, t = 0) = ξ. The description of a physical phenomena is independent of the choice of
the coordinate system. Both x and ξ can provide the necessary coordinate system, the ﬁrst is the usual Eulerian
coordinates while the second one is the well-known Lagrangian coordinates. Unlike the usual Eulerian coordinates,
the Lagrangian coordinates have a non-trivial metric tensor. In fact it has both a space and a time dependence. If
the metric tensor of the Eulerian frame is the unit matrix, the metric tensor of the Lagrangian coordinates is deﬁned
as

∂x/∂ξi

∂x/∂ξj and gij

gij ≡

·

ξi

ξj.

≡ ∇

· ∇

The metric tensor, by its deﬁnition, is entirely determined by the ﬂow ﬁeld. Even for a perfectly smooth steady ﬂow
ﬁeld, the metric tensor tends to become singular as t becomes large. If the ﬂow is integrable, the metric tensor diverges
at most quadratically in time [9]. For a chaotic ﬂow, the metric tensor blows up exponentially in some subspaces. As
long as the ﬂow ﬁeld is well-behaved, the metric tensor is well behaved and does not possess any ﬁnite time singularity.
Since the Lagrangian coordinates are attached to the ﬂuid elements, the solution to the ideal advection equation
is equivalent to integrating the trajectory x(ξ, t) and setting φ(x(ξ, t), t) = φ(ξ, t = 0). If the spatial gradient of φ is
written in Lagrangian coordinates,

condition,
important characteristics can be immediately explained once the covariant representation of the metric tensor, gij, is
identiﬁed as the Oseledec matrix [12]. Since gij is a positive, deﬁnite symmetric matrix, it can be diagonalized with
real eigenvectors and positive eigenvalues,

The metric tensor that enters the last calculation is its contravariant form gij, which is the exact matrix inverse of
gij, hence gij = exp(

2λt)ˆeˆe + exp(2λt)ˆsˆs.

What immediately can be seen is that under ideal advection, the passive scalar gradient would blow up exponentially
in time without bound since
∇0φ(ξ) is time-independent. This reﬂects the singular nature of the diﬀusion term as
a perturbation to the ideal advection equation. The existence of a diﬀusion term, no matter how small D is, would
eventually remove any gradient in φ. Since the metric tensor has an exponential factor, the diﬀusion responsible for
the relaxation of
∇0φ(ξ, t) must have a super-exponential dependence in order to overcome the exponential factor in
the metric tensor. The second note is that the diﬀusion is essentially one dimensional since the exponential growing
term in the metric tensor is only in the one dimensional subspace deﬁned by ˆs.

III. TIME-DEPENDENT SOLUTION TO THE ADVECTION-DIFFUSION EQUATION

In this section we give an example for a bounded ﬂow, i.e. a closed system. The open ﬂow conﬁguration, the main
focus of this paper, is treated afterwards. A closed system corresponds to an initial value problem. The equation to
solve is the advection-diﬀusion equation,

We have restricted the discussion to a two dimensional ﬂow. The three dimensional case is treated in [9].

The exponential anisotropy of the tensor diﬀusivity along diﬀerent directions implies that the diﬀusive relaxation

is determined by a one dimensional diﬀusion equation,

The usefulness of above formulation rests on the fact that ˆs converges exponentially to a time asymptotic limit ˆs∞(ξ).
A time-independent vector ﬁeld ˆs∞(ξ) allows the usual construction of a coordinate system that makes the calculation
well-deﬁned. Parameterizing distance along the ˆs line by a scalar ﬁeld β, one has

The exponential convergence rate of ˆs to ˆs∞ implies that the calculation based on the time-asymptotic spatial
coordinates is exponentially accurate.

The solution to the one dimensional diﬀusion equation is determined by two quantities. One is the fundamental
λL2/D,
time scale of the problem, the local Lyapunov time of the ﬂow 1/λ. The other is the dimensionless number Ω
which is the ratio between the characteristic diﬀusion time scale L2/D and the Lyapunov time of the ﬂow. If Ω
1
which is generally true due to the smallness of the molecular diﬀusivity, the scalar ﬁeld undergoes a pure advection
(ln 2Ω)/2λ. The ideal advection increases the gradients of the passive scalar ﬁeld (in Eulerian frame)
until time ta ≡
by a factor of Ω. There is a rapid diﬀusive relaxation [super-exponential in ∂ϕ(ξ, t)/∂β] which removes the gradients
ϕ(x, t) during a short interval of a few Lyapunov time after ta.
A clariﬁcation should be made on the deﬁnition of the Lyapunov time for passive scalar transport studies. To our
knowledge, in the literature (for a review, see [4]), the Lyapunov time of a ﬂow is uniformly associated with the stretch
rate, i.e. the largest positive Lyapunov exponent of the ﬂow. This is a misconception and the reason can be easily seen
λ, i.e.
by examining equations (7,9,10, 11,12). The correct statement is that the most negative Lyapunov exponent

the convergence rate, deﬁnes the Lyapunov time 1/λ for the passive scalar transport. In the case of a two dimensional
time-dependent divergence-free ﬂow which happens to be the starting point of much of the existing literature, the
positive Lyapunov exponent has the same magnitude as the negative one due to the constraint of area-preserving, so
this distinction is not mathematically important despite its physical signiﬁcance. However, in the more general case
of a three dimensional ﬂow or compressible ﬂows, a correct understanding of this subtlety is necessary both physically
and mathematically.

If the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent does not vary in space, then one has the ideal situation that the diﬀusive
relaxation uniformly removes the gradients. Unfortunately the only ﬂow that is known to have this property is purely
hyperbolic. An example is the Arnold’s cat map. Generic ﬂows are non-hyperbolic and the ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent has a peculiar spatial dependence. Roughly speaking, λ(ξ, t) varies smoothly along the ˆs lines, which is
required for equations (12,13) to be well-posed. The variation of λ(ξ, t) across the ˆs lines is pathological: the gradient
of λ(ξ, t) in directions other than ˆs∞ has an exponential dependence in time. The smoothness of λ along the ˆs lines
permits the existence of a class of diﬀusion barrier in a chaotic region. The pathology of λ across the ˆs∞ direction
gives rise to the fractal-like transport in both space and time.

A crude estimate of the mixing process can be based on the probability distribution function of the ﬁnite time
Lyapunov exponent. If the distribution function is an δ function centered at λ∞. The relaxation of (
φ)2 follows a
simple route. The gradient grows by a factor of Ω and is then removed during a Lyapunov time centered on time
(ln 2Ω)/2λ. Equivalently the global mixing index σ(t) stays the same until time ta, after which it exponentially
ta ≡
decays to zero within a few Lyapunov time. If the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent has a broadened distribution like
that shown in [8], the time evolution of the global mixing index can be found by convoluting the ideal mixing curve
with the λ distribution function. For a ﬂow having noticeable amount of remnant integrable region, there is usually
a signiﬁcant bump at the left end of the distribution function. Since the distribution function is sampled over the
entire space, there are actually two types of trajectories which could contribute to this bump. The ﬁrst is simply the
integrable trajectory lying on the KAM surfaces. The second one forms the so-called stochastic layer, a sticky region
surrounding the remnant KAM islands. The bump in the distribution function is responsible for the long tail of the
σ relaxation curve. The experimental observation of a spread in σ relaxation is determined by the λ proﬁle.

∇

Although the features of the global solution is roughly given by the mean Lyapunov time, the Ω number associated
with the local Lyapunov time dictates the local details of the solution. For example, since diﬀusion occurs only along
an ˆs line, the place with a peculiarly small ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent would pose as a practical diﬀusion barrier.
A more precise description is based on the theory of ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent [8,13]. The ﬁnite time Lyapunov
exponent exponentially converges to a form of three parts:

(14)

(15)

(16)

The two convergence functions have entirely diﬀerent properties. The function ˜λ is a smooth function of space and it
is related to the geometry of the ˆs line by

∇0 ·
The function f (ξ, t) reﬂects the pathology in the spatial variation of the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent. First it does
not vary along the ˆs direction,

ˆs∞(ξ)

· ∇0˜λ +

ˆs∞ = 0.

Secondly it develops an exponentially growing gradients in the direction across the ˆs∞, for example,

Of course, the time dependence of f (ξ, t) has to be bounded by √t so limt→∞ λ = λ∞.

Although equation (15) states that the ﬁnite time Lyapunov exponent achieves an extreme when

ˆs∞ vanishes,
numerical calculations show that λ reaches its local minimum where the ˆs line makes sharp bend. The sharp drop
in the magnitude of λ implies that these sharp bends of an ˆs line are practical diﬀusion barriers. We note that an ˆs
line belongs to a chaotic region, and they persist even if the ﬂow is far from integrable. Equivalently speaking, even
if the ﬂow is driven globally chaotic without discernible KAM islands, there are still regions with retarded mixing.
Since the production of new chemical C depends on the ﬁnal diﬀusive relaxation of A and B, these diﬀusion barriers
directly aﬀects the quality of a reactor.

IV. STEADY STATE MIXER

An eﬃcient engineering device employs an open ﬂow operating at steady state. The simplest geometry for such a
device is a pipe [7,14,15] so we will consider the cylindrical geometry. The ﬂow ﬁeld is assumed to be divergence-free
and quasi-two-dimensional,

v(x, y, z) = ˆz

ψ(x, y, z) + vz(x, y)ˆz.

× ∇

The absence of a z dependence in vz(x, y) implies that the ﬂow ﬁeld is divergence-free in the transverse plane,
ψ(x, y, z). If the mixer is operated at steady state (∂φ/∂t = 0), the governing

The optimization of a mixing device or a reactor is primarily looking for a balance between the production rate
FA, reactor length L, and the desired Q-factor. Implicitly through the Q-factor there is also an energy consumption
penalty (power P ) for driving a ﬂow ﬁeld v(x). These correspond to four design constraints: 1] geometrical constraint,
i.e. the physical size limit for the device; 2] production rate constraint; 3] production quality constraint; 4] energy
constraint. The ﬁrst three are kinematic constraints since they are uniquely determined by the ﬂow ﬁeld [Except
that in a reactor, there is a minimal length constraint due to the ﬁnite reaction time, i.e. the system size has to be
greater than vz/κ
. This point was made earlier in the introduction]. The last one is a dynamical constraint and
i
it requires solving the Navier-Stokes equation to relate the driving term to the ﬂow ﬁeld.

This paper addresses the kinematic constraints. The dynamical constraint for the ﬂow ﬁeld is more case-dependent.
Nevertheless, a general statement can be made that it is usually less energy consuming to produce a smooth, non-
turbulent, but chaotic ﬂow, than a turbulent one. In the case of a tubular device, this is reﬂected by a small increase
in the pressure drop over the tube, or equivalently the pumping power, to induce a chaotic ﬂow with satisfactory
mixing properties [16].

The physical meaning of the kinematic constraints will become clear once the solution to equation (18) is found.
The most important property of the ﬂow ﬁeld in determining the kinematic constraint is the so-called local Lyapunov

parameterize a ﬂuid trajectory. The only constraint for z to be a good scalar for parameterization is that vz nowhere
vanishes. This is naturally satisﬁed in our choice of a quasi-two-dimensional ﬂow ﬁeld, ∂vz/∂z = 0. Any point
satisfying vz(x0, y0) = 0 would imply that vz vanishes along a straight line from (x0, y0, z = 0) to (x0, y0, z = L),
which strictly prohibits transport. Hence vz would be made nonzero in a working device. This is easily achievable by
an inﬁnitesimal longitudinal perturbation.

The singular nature of the solution to the equation (19) can be seen by a coordinate transformation. The ﬂuid

trajectory is now parameterized by z and given by

For an arbitrary initial position (x0, y0) at z = 0 plane, a trajectory of the ﬂuid element can be traced to (x, y) at
z-plane. The functional relationship between x(x0, y0, z) and y(x0, y0, z) is found by integrating equation (22) with
initial position (x0, y0) from z = 0 to z.

Hence two initial points separating along the ˆe direction would diverge exponentially going downstream, but they
would converge exponentially going downstream if their initial separation is along the ˆs direction. Conventionally ˆe
is called the unstable direction and ˆs is the stable direction. The function η(x0, y0, z) which depends on the initial
position of the trajectory (x0, y0) and the longitudinal ending point z, is a local Lyapunov exponent measuring the
exponential separation rate. The inverse of η(x0, y0, z) deﬁnes a local Lyapunov scale, i.e. the longitudinal distance
over which the separation of neighboring trajectories varies by one e-fold. This is also the longitudinal distance over
which the gradient of a passive scalar ﬁeld increases by one e-fold in the absence of diﬀusion.

The reduction in σ(z) can be calculated using a simpler form in the usual case R2vzη/D

ˆs(x0, y0, z) can be replaced by its z-asymptotic limit ˆs∞(x0, y0) with an exponentially small correction. Combining

The solution of this one dimensional equation diﬀers from that of the full equation by an exponentially small term in

1 and the initial gradient has a scale comparable to R.

The solution to equations (27,28) has remarkable properties for a chaotic ﬂow (η > 0.) Since the longitudinal
distance plays the role of time in a steady state system, the usual characteristic diﬀusion time R2/D gives rise to an
equivalent characteristic longitudinal length for diﬀusion R2vz/D. The ratio of this characteristic longitudinal length

length. There is little mixing and hence reaction in a region within a critical length

from the intake of the device. In fact, there is only one e-fold drop in σ(z)/σ(0) over the entire longitudinal length

thus a reator of longitudinal length Lc + N/η has a Q-factor of

(33)

The above formula implies that it takes less than N = 3 additional Lyapunov lengths to achieve a Q-factor of 108.
For a reactor with a length of Lc + 3/η, less than one part of ten thousands input reactants fails to react at the
moment of discharge. It must be emphasized that Lc is a modest number even if the reactants are extremely diﬃcult
to mix, which is usually the case due to the smallness of D. For example, even if Ω = 1010, Lc is about 12 Lyapunov
length 1/η. A reactor of Q-factor 1010 requires a total longitudinal length of 15 Lyapunov lengths. In giving out these
numbers, we have assumed that the chemicals undergo a diﬀusion-limited reaction. Even if the reaction rate is so
slow that Lc is less than a typical reaction length vz/κ

VI. LOCAL LYAPUNOV EXPONENT AND THE Q-FACTOR

The local Lyapunov exponent, or equivalently the local Lyapunov length, has a profound role in determining the
quality of a reactor. In retrospect, the design of a quality reactor can be considered as an optimization of the local
Lyapunov exponents. The simplest way to understand the eﬀect of a spatially varying Lyapunov exponent on mixing
is through its probability distribution function P (η, z = L) for a steady state reactor.
If η is a global constant,
P (η, z = L) would, of course, be a delta function. Nonhyperbolicity prevents this for a generic ﬂow. Instead there is
a large spread in the distribution function. The mixing index, or the Q-factor, can be approximated by convoluting
the distribution function with equation (31). For a device of longitudinal length L operating with reactants of
characteristic diﬀusion time scale R2/D, there is a critical Lyapunov exponent ηc(z = L) given by the solution to
equation

Lc is a monotonically decreasing function in η if η > ηT , but a monotonically increasing function if η < ηT . The
longer the characteristic diﬀusion time R2/D, the less likely that the second critical scale ηT (z = L) plays a role. In
other words, unless R2/D is small enough to render the chaotic mixer unnecessary, one does not need to worry about
the subtleties associated with ηT .

In the language of hamiltonian mechanics, the integrable region or the KAM surfaces, are absolute barriers to
advective transport because no trajectories could cross them, at least for systems with no Arnold diﬀusion. It is also
an eﬀective barrier for diﬀusive transport in the advection-diﬀusion theory. This is explained by the time dependence
of the largest eigenvalue of the metric tensor. It was shown [9] that the largest eigenvalue of the metric tensor in an
integrable region grows at most quadratically in time, with the prefactor given by the shear rate of the surface [9],
i.e. the derivative of the rotational transform normal to a KAM surface. Contrasted with the exponential growth in a
chaotic region, the eﬀective diﬀusivity in (x0, y0) coordinates, Dgij, is small and hence the diﬀusive relaxation occurs
on a much longer time scale.

The simplest design optimization is to reduce the size of the remnant integrable regions. Once resonant perturbations
are present, global stochasticity can be achieved by increasing the perturbation strength. This is remarkable since it
separates the global stochasticity for the trajectories from the spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld. A turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld is
usually associated with a broad spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld. A laminar, but chaotic, ﬂow has well-behaved velocity
ﬁeld, which is reﬂected by a few isolated spectral peaks. The optimization involves the adjustment of the relative
strength of the peaks. The reduction of the integrable regions can then be realized under the constraint of maintaining
the laminar nature of the ﬂow.

The signature of a signiﬁcant amount of integrable region in the local Lyapunov exponent is a large bump at the
near-zero end of the distribution function. The local Lyapunov exponent is also well-deﬁned using the metric tensor
in an integrable region, even though the asymptotic Lyapunov exponent vanishes. This is trivially explained by the
fact that a quadratic function can always be approximated by an exponential function locally.

VII. GEOMETRICAL CONSTRAINT ON A PRACTICAL DIFFUSION BARRIER

p

Even if the integrable regions are so small that they are all invisible to naked eyes, or in the extreme, of size smaller
DL/vz, the local Lyapunov exponent still has a ﬁnite spread in the distribution function. What makes the
than
matter worse is that the distribution function tends to preserve an asymmetry biased towards the small η end. This
statement is based on equations (14,15,16) and the numerical observation that η always takes a local minimum, rather
than a local maximum, where the ˆs line makes a sharp bend. Since the local Lyapunov exponent varies little where
the ˆs line is straight, but makes a sharp dip when the ˆs makes a sharp bend, there is an overall bias towards small η
in the distribution function, even if only the chaotic trajectories are included in the distribution function calculation.
Surprisingly the presence of a small local Lyapunov exponent does not always lead to a practical diﬀusion barrier.
To be a practical diﬀusion barrier, not only a small eﬀective diﬀusivity is required, but also the size of the structure.
Roughly speaking, the diﬀusivity D sets the minimal size of a practical diﬀusion barrier, although the integrability of
the trajectories also plays an important role. In an integrable region, the ˆs lines closes on itself forming closed KAM
curves. The shear-induced fast diﬀusion is conﬁned within the KAM surfaces so the radial diﬀusivity is just D. The
minimal size requirement of a practical barrier is given by

w =

DL/vz.

(36)

p
It is the mean spread of an initial δ-distribution at the center of an integrable island at the time of discharge.

In a chaotic region, diﬀusion occurs only along the ˆs direction, but the ˆs lines can not close on themselves. A single
ˆs line indeed ﬁlls an entire ergodic component densely. The previous estimate for the integrable case, equation (36),
usually is too small. The minimal size for the diﬀusion barrier is comparable to

The cut-oﬀ size for a practical diﬀusion barrier brings a natural limit on the ﬁnest grid size in a numerical calculation.
It also opens the possibility for a paradoxical statement that a smaller η in the distribution function might not imply
poorer mixing because the geometrical constraint, equations (36,37). Consequently equation (35) might not be a
proper estimate for a globally chaotic ﬂow.

An appropriate formula for estimating the Q-factor is based on the exact spatial dependence of the local Lyapunov

exponent, η(x0, y0, L). The formula is based on the integral

case that Ω
DL/vz can be tiny compared with the transversal scale of the device R. Equation (39) is the
proper formula for calculating the Q-factor in a highly chaotic ﬂow. It should also yield a better estimate for the
near-integrable cases, but might not be necessary. In principle, if the ﬂow ﬁeld v(x, y, z) is known, one would calculate
η(x0, y0, L) and use equation (39) for Q. The main usage of a probability distribution function based formula like
equation (35) is in experimental situations where an exact measurement of η(x0, y0, L) is inaccessible. P (η, z = L)
can be easily approximated by a limited amount of measurements. For those who could aﬀord the time and resources,
all quantities can be found to exponential accuracy by solving equations (27,28) for a given velocity ﬁeld v(x, y, z).

p

In retrospect, a fully chaotic reactor can be further optimized by balancing the value of the local Lyapunov exponent
and the sharpness of the ˆs-bend. The basic idea is to either straight out the ˆs line or make the bends suﬃciently
sharp that equation (37) is violated.

VIII. A SPECIFIC NUMERICAL EXAMPLE

Since the goal of this paper is to demonstrate the basic principles rather than working with a speciﬁc device, the
illustrative example will be chosen as simple as possible and computationally as eﬃcient as possible. Nevertheless,
there are a few features that we do intend to include to make it practically relevant. First we want the example
ﬂow to have a bounded chaotic region since it is supposed to be conﬁned by a pipe. The ﬂow is also expected to be
stochastic along the axis. Divergence-free is another useful feature to be consistent with earlier analysis.

The simplest chaotic ﬂow of the form equation (17) has vz a constant and ψ a periodic function of z. The standard
treatment of this class of ﬂow is to construct a mapping by sampling at the period of ψ along z axis. The mapping
thus generated preserves both the topology of the Lagrangian trajectories, the functional form of the local Lyapunov
exponents (except z takes discrete values), and the geometry of the ˆs lines. Mapping is enormously more eﬃcient
than the ﬂow in computations. Hence our example will employ a mapping directly, but with the understanding that
it was reduced from a constant-vz and z-periodic-ψ smooth three dimensional ﬂow.

It should be noted right away that in a practical application, an analytic form of the ﬂow ﬁeld is unlikely available,
let alone an exact reduction to a mapping. However, this simpliﬁcation is just for the convenience of illustration, the
lack of it does not prevent a practical calculation.

There are three equations mapping (xn, yn, zn) to (xn+1, yn+1, zn+1). One of them is simply

with ∆z the period of ψ. To insure area conservation, the example mapping that relates (xn, yn) to (xn+1, yn+1) is
deﬁned by a generating function, which has one free parameter k,

Here k signiﬁes the perturbation. The map is given by

Γ−
Figure 1 plots the intercepts of trajectories on the (x0, y0) plane. The topology of this intercepts tells the integrability
of the trajectories going downstream. Since the ﬂow ﬁeld is periodic in z, the cross sections at z = N ∆z would have the
same topology as that of (x0, y0) plane. Because of this, an eﬃcient way to understand the topology is by projecting
the intercepts of a long trajectory with cross sections at z = N ∆z, N = 0, 1, 2,
, on the (x0, y0) plane. Since
we already have the proper mapping, this becomes simply plotting the trajectories of the two dimensional mapping
(xn, yn)
(xn+1, yn+1). This is exactly how ﬁgure 1 is generated. Obviously our example map has a bounded chaotic
region and it is stochastic near the axis.

The most important feature we wish to demonstrate here is the geometry of the ˆs lines and the spatial variation
of the local Lyapunov exponent. The ˆs(x0, y0) line sits on the z = 0 cross section. The statement that diﬀusive
relaxation only occurs along the ˆs lines in (x0, y0) coordinates is equivalent to say that, initial chemical reactants
located along an ˆs line will come close together and react to form new product CC . The sharp bends of the ˆs line
give rise to a peculiarly small local Lyapunov exponent which hinders diﬀusive relaxation. This relationship between
the local Lyapunov exponent and the ˆs-bends is shown in Figure 2. Wherever the curvature of the ˆs goes up sharply,
there is a signiﬁcant dip in the local Lyapunov exponent.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered the design criteria of a chemical reactor device based on a chaotic ﬂow. Particular attention
has been paid to a steady state reactor, where the Lyapunov length provides the fundamental spatial scale for the
problem. The advantages of a chaotic ﬂow for a steady-state reactor can be summarized into two scaling relations: 1]
the minimum longitudinal length of a reactor, Lc, has a logarithmic dependence on the diﬀusivity D, equation (32);
2] the quality of the reactor, the so-called Q-factor, has a super-exponential dependence on each additional Lyapunov
length beyond Lc, equation (33).

The Lyapunov length 1/η, as deﬁned through equations (22, 24), is a local Lyapunov length since it depends on
the initial position (x0, y0) and the longitudinal displacement z of the test ﬂuid point. The local Lyapunov length are
deﬁned everywhere in the (x0, y0) plane, independent of whether the trajectory is chaotic or integrable. If the global
ﬂow ﬁeld is known, the Q-factor of the reactor can be calculated via equation (39). In the experimental situation
that the global ﬂow ﬁeld is not available, one can approximate the probability distribution function of the local
Lyapunov exponent (length) by repeated measurements over time. The Q-factor can then be estimated by equation
(35). Although the derivation is presented with the assumption that ﬂow ﬁeld obeys equation (17), these formulae are
expected to be useful under more general conditions, such as a weak z-dependence of vz and a weak time dependence
of v. The fast reaction scenario, equation (5), which brought mathematical simplicity to the discussion, can also be
relaxed. A naive way to approach this is assuming that there is no reaction till length Lc + N/η, after which the
reaction is suddenly turned on. If the fast reaction condition is satisﬁed, near-perfectly mixed chemicals A and B
immediately react to form C. Otherwise there is a delay to achieve the same Q-factor. The additional length for the
reactor is the reaction length, the product of the reaction time 1/κ

and the longitudinal ﬂow velocity vz.

For a closed ﬂow reactor such as a stirred tank, the results obtained for the steady-state device can be straight-
forwardly translated by identifying the longitudinal length z as time t. The time scales replace the spatial scales as
the quantities of concern. For example, the Lyapunov length 1/η is replaced by the Lyapunov time 1/λ and the
crtical length Lc is replaced by a critical advection time ta. One diﬀerence is that in a steady-state tubular device,
the streamwise distance can always be used to reduce the problem to a two dimensional one, equation (22), but the
time-dependent closed ﬂow reactor usually has to deal with a truely three dimensional ﬂow, in addition to a possible
time dependence. Fortunately, aside from some additional subtleties, the main physical charatersitics of the transport
of a passive scalar in a three dimensional ﬂow is the same as the two dimensional case [9].

FIG. 2. The local Lyapunov exponent at z = N ∆z with N = 5 (∆z is the spatial period of the ﬂow ﬁeld in z direction) and
the curvature κ of the ˆs line are plotted along an ˆs line shown in ﬁgure 1. The local Lyapunov exponent makes a sharp dip
wherever the ˆs line makes a sharp turn. The missing dips at extremely large curvature are due to ﬁnite machine precision and
integration stepsizes.

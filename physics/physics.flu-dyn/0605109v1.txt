Thin ﬁlm dynamics on a vertically rotating
disk partially immersed in a liquid bath

The axisymmetric ﬂow of a thin liquid ﬁlm is considered for the problem
of a vertically rotating disk that is partially immersed in a liquid bath.
A model for the fully three-dimensional free-boundary problem of the ro-
tating disk, that drags a thin ﬁlm out of the bath is set up. From this,
a dimension-reduced extended lubrication approximation that includes the
meniscus region is derived. This problem constitutes a generalization of
the classic drag-out and drag-in problem to the case of axisymmetric ﬂow.
The resulting nonlinear fourth-order partial diﬀerential equation for the ﬁlm
proﬁle is solved numerically using a ﬁnite element scheme. For a range of
parameters steady states are found and compared to asymptotic solutions.
Patterns of the ﬁlm proﬁle, as a function of immersion depth and angular
velocity are discussed.

Abstract

1 Introduction

The problem of rotating thin ﬁlm ﬂows has been investigated extensively,
both theoretically and experimentally, due to the many technological appli-
cations. Starting with the work by Emslie et al. [4], various aspects of this
type of surface tension driven ﬂow, inﬂuencing the shape and stability of the
ﬁlm, have been studied. These include for example non-Newtonian eﬀects
[5], evaporation [13] and Coriolis force [11]. As with those studies most of
them dealt with a conﬁguration where the ﬂuid layer is moving on a hori-
zontally rotating disk. Making use of the large scale separation between the
small thickness of the ﬁlm and the length scale of the evolving patterns, thin
ﬁlm models where used to derive dimension-reduced models of the underlying
three-dimensional free boundary problems.

For the situation of a disk that is partially immersed in a bath of liquid and
rotating about the horizontal axis, thereby dragging out a thin ﬁlm onto the
disk (see ﬁgure 1), there are far fewer studies even though this conﬁguration
is typical for many applications. For example, for oil disk skimmers, which
is used as an eﬀective device for oil recovery and as an alternative to toxic
chemical dispersants, used after an oﬀshore oil spill. Another application is
the ﬂuid dynamical aspects in connection with the synthesis of Polyethylen-
terephthalat(PET) in polycondensation reactors. These typically consist of
a horizontal cylinder that is partially ﬁlled with polymer melt and contains
disks rotating about the horizontal axis of the cylinder, thus picking up and
spreading the melt in form of a thin ﬁlm over a large area of the disks.

These type of problems always involve a meniscus region, that connects
the thin ﬁlm to the liquid bath and a spacially oscillating region shortly
before the ﬁlm is dragged into the bath again. In these two regions the scale
separation is not large anymore and hence the lubrication approximation is
not valid there. Nevertheless, the meniscus does play the crucial role of ﬁxing
the height of the dragged out ﬁlm and therefore both, the meniscus region
and similarly the drag-in region that connecting the thin ﬁlm to the liquid
bath must be accounted for in a dimension-reduced model, which we will
derive in this paper. The classic and far simpler setting of the free boundary
problems for falling and rising thin ﬁlm ﬂows on vertical as well as inclined
planes has been investigated as early as in the work by Landau and Levich
[9]. Their work lead to the prediction of the height and shape of the thin ﬁlm
emerging out of the meniscus. The results were improved by Wilson [16] and
for the case of a Marangoni-driven rising ﬁlm by [15] and M¨unch [10], using

systematic asymptotic analysis in the limit of small capillary numbers. Such
asymptotic analyses can be applied to more complex situations such as the
problem we consider here for the vertically rotating disk.

Previous studies for this problem was performed by Christodoulo et al.
[1]. The employed the analysis of the meniscus region by Wilson [16] for the
problem of ﬂow control for rotating oil disk skimmers. Their study did not
extend further into the thin ﬁlm region on the remainder of the disk. How-
ever, for many applications it is important to answer questions for example
on the maximum surface area of the ﬁlm proﬁle or the optimum volume of
liquid that is dragged out and spread on the disk, for which the predictions
resulting from the simple drag-out study will not be suﬃcient. Up to now
no complete model for the vertically rotating disk, including its numerical
solution has appeared. This will be the topic of this paper.

In section 2 we set up the corresponding three-dimensional free bound-
ary problem. A fully three-dimensional analysis of such ﬂows represents a
very time consuming task, analytically and numerically. To be able to per-
form systematic parameter studies we therefore exploit the large separation
of scales to obtain a dimension-reduced lubrication model. This model will
then be extended to match to the ﬂow ﬁeld in the meniscus region. For
the resulting model we develop in section 3 a weak formulation and a corre-
sponding ﬁnite element discretization for the full dynamical problem. Since
we want to address here issues of maximum surface area of the ﬁlm proﬁle or
the optimum volume of liquid that is dragged out, we are intersted mainly in
the long-time behavior. This will be the focus of the following sections. In
section 4 we solve and discuss for a range of parameters the emerging steady
state solutions. Their shapes near the meniscus region are then compared
to the asymptotic solution of the corresponding drag-out problem. Away
from the liquid bath the ﬁlm proﬁle is compared to asymptotic solutions, by
using the methods of characteristics. For both regions excellent agreement
is found. Finally, we discuss the novel patterns for the ﬁlm proﬁle as the
immersion depth, or the angular velocity is varied.

2.1 Governing Equations

We consider the isothermal ﬂow of an incompressible, viscous liquid on a
vertical disk rotating in the vertical plane and partially immersed in the
liquid. We assume that the disk of radius R rotates with the angular velocity
Ω about a horizontal axis, which has distance a to the bath, see ﬁgure 1.

To formulate the problem, we introduce cylindrical polar coordinates
(r, θ, z) in the laboratory frame of reference. We let the liquid velocity vector
have components (u, v, w) and let ω denote the angular velocity vector with
components (0, 0, Ω). The momentum balance equations can be expressed as

2.2 Lubrication approximation

The solution of the above three-dimensional free boundary problem repre-
sents, analytically and numerically a time consuming task for making accu-
rate parameter studies. The key idea that we make use of here in order to
obtain a mathematically and numerically tractable problem, is the exploita-
tion of the scale separation in most parts of this ﬂow problem.
We begin by introducing dimensionsless variables and set

θ = ¯θ,

r = L¯r,
u = U ¯u, v = U ¯v, w = W ¯w,
t = T ¯t.
p = P ¯p,

z = H ¯z,

The characteristic velocity U is set by the velocity of the rotating disk. For
given radius R of the disk we let

U = RΩ.

(2.16)

We determine the scale for the characteristic height H by balancing the
dominant viscous term with gravitational term in the u-momentum equation,
which yields

Furthermore, we require that the pressure must also balance the dominant
viscous term, so that

and that surface tension is important, so that from the normal stress bound-
ary condition we ﬁnd

We assume that the liquid ﬁlm is very thin and that the velocity in the

direction normal to the disk is much smaller than along the disk. We let

2.3 Region near the liquid bath

The scalings introduced so far are appropriate for the thin ﬁlm region away
from the liquid bath. This yields a leading order theory that retains the
terms that are dominant for the ﬁlm proﬁle on the disk, where slopes are
small. Towards the liquid bath the ﬁlm proﬁle becomes (in fact inﬁnitely)
steep and a lubrication scaling is no longer appropriate. Rather, the proﬁle is
governed by the balance of gravity and surface tension forces, in fact, much
as in a static meniscus. Hence, the appropriate length scales for all spatial
coordinates is the capillary length scale lcap =

σ/(ρg).

p

9

This length scale can be easily expressed in terms of the lubrication length
scales H and L times an appropriate power of ε, so that the new meniscus
length scales (denoted by tildes) become

˜H = ε−3/2H,

˜L = ε−1/2L.

(2.29)

The parallel velocity scale is unchanged and equal to U = RΩ, while the
normal is now U instead of εU. The time scale

is again a result of the kinematic condition. The pressure scale is determined
by surface tension, and we ﬁnd

Hence, all variables can be transformed to meniscus scalings simply by rescal-
ing with powers of ε, according to

r = ε−1/2˜r,
u = ˜u,
t = ε−1/2˜t,

z = ε−3/2˜z,
v = ˜v,
p = ε−1/2 ˜p.

h = ε−3/2˜h,
w = ε−1 ˜w,

Inserting these scalings into (2.23a)–(2.28), yields the rescaled equations:

We now retain all terms that appear to leading order either in the lu-
brication or the meniscus scalings. Note that, in the meniscus scalings, the
velocity ﬁeld decouples to leading order from the pressure ﬁeld that deter-
mines the surface proﬁle. Hence the dominant terms that govern h in these
scalings consists of the pressure and gravity terms, and of surface tension,
based on the full nonlinear expression for curvature. All these terms already
appear also in the lubrication scaling, except for the nonlinear curvature.
Hence our approximate model retains essentially the terms from a leading

For the immersing boundary condition, where the thin ﬁlm connects to the

4 Steady states

4.1 The half-immersed disk

We ﬁrst discuss the case for the half-immersed disk at some length and com-
pare our numerical results to asymptotic solutions near the liquid bath and
in the thin ﬁlm region of the disk before we consider diﬀerent immersion
depths.

4.1.1 Numerical results

We consider now a disk rotating about the horizontal axis with a constant
angular speed Ω and being half-immersed in the liquid bath. The triangu-
lation of the computational domain is performed in cylindrical coordinates
r, θ. The ﬁnite element mesh, used here, consists of 9533 triangular elements
and 19522 nodes. The mesh is reﬁned on the boundary Γpool to resolve the
meniscus region. The steady state for equations (3.1, 3.2) is obtained via
time integration with an adaptive time step. As the stopping criterion for
< 10−13
the Newton iterations a general threshold for the residuum
is applied.

Without loss of generality we choose the following values for the parame-
ters throughout the paper: µ = 1 Pa s, ρ = 1000 kg/m3, σ = 72.7e
3 N/m,
2 m, g = 9.81 m/s2. For the initial state we choose a partially
R = 2.723e
constant proﬁle on the top of the disk and a partially parabolic one towards
the liquid bath, as shown in the Figure 2. For the given U = 7.917e
4 m/s
and R we ﬁnd the angular velocity Ω = U/R = 0.02908s−1 = 0.277 r.p.m,
where the last equality is obtained by multiplying with 60/2π. For these
values the capillary number is small Ca = 0.01089, the length scales are
˜H = ˜L = lcap = (σ/ρg)1/2 = 2.723e
3 and the dimension-
less radius of the disk is 10. The resulting steady state is shown on the top
of ﬁgure 2. It shows the an increase of thickness as the radius and hence the
angular velocity increases, as expected. With increasing θ gravity causes the

creasing θ and reenters the bath with a typical capillary ridge. If we increase
Ω, while keeping the other dimensional parameters and disk radius ﬁxed,
neither the length scales nor the dimensionless radius of the disk change, but
U, the capillary number and ˆΩ do. As examples we let

Ω = 2.0

Figure 3 illustrates the steady states for rotation velocities Ω = 0.277, 1.0,

from top to bottom, respectively. In all cases the height of the
ﬁlm in the ﬁgures is multiplied by the factor of 10 to contrast more clearly
the structure of the ﬁlm patterns.

One observes for all values of Ω of the steady solutions a region of liquid
drag-out with a meniscus proﬁle and a drag-in region with a capillary wave
on the opposite side of the axis. Such an oscillation of the height is typically
found for the reverse Landau-Levich problem when a liquid thin ﬁlm is
dragged into a liquid bath, see for example [2, 7, 14, 17]. It can be seen more
clearly when comparing the cross sections of the liquid proﬁles at constant
In ﬁgure 4 we compare for the radius r = 9 the cross section for
radii.
Ω = 0.277, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 r.p.m. (Note, that here as further below, values such
as for r without an explicit dimensions are in fact dimensionless). The ﬁgure
also shows that the the average liquid height increases when Ω increases.

These results are qualitatively in accordance with the problem for the
drag-out and drag-in cases. We will further investigate the quantitative com-
parison.

4.1.2 Comparison with the drag-out problem

Asymptotic estimate of the ﬁlm thickness We now derive an asymp-
totic approximation of the ﬁlm thickness using a one dimensional approxi-
mation based on the results of Landau, Levich [9] and Wilson [16] for the
planar-symmetric case.

For our comparisons we focus on the case where the disk is half immersed,
i.e. a = 0. Then, if we only retain the axial components in the stationary
dy we obtain the
form of (2.41), and after substituting rθ

h∞ = 0.94581 (r ˆΩ)2/3.

that there is excellent quantitative agreement in the vicinity of the meniscus
region as it enters the thin ﬁlm region.

4.1.3 Comparison with the hyperbolic regime

Further out into the disk region the height proﬁle will deviate from the height
obtained for the drag-out problem. There the variation of the height along
the directions parallel to the disk is very small, which is clearly seen in our
numerical simulations, so that surface tension will play a negligible role.

obtain characteristics. This is shown in ﬁgure 7 for Ω = 0.277 as an example.
The results are similar for the other angular velocities. As can be seen, the
comparison of the characteristics that start from the meniscus region shows
good agreement with the contour lines found from the FEM computation.
Note, that the contour lines that start at the boundary of the rotating disk
strongly depend on the conditions there.

Interestingly, one can get a good idea on the ﬁlm proﬁle as a function of

4.2 Film patterns for slightly immersed disks

When the disk is half-immersed (immersion height a = 0) the ﬁlm thickness
above the drag-out region will be renewed with every rotation and can be

0.0130, 0.0182, 0.0234, 0.0286, 0.0338, 0.0390, respectively. Note, the corre-

described by the classic drag-out problem. Furthermore, the ﬁlm proﬁle is
slightly deformed by the eﬀects of gravity before being drawn into the liquid
bath accompanied by a typical oscillation in the thicknes of the ﬁlm. The
simple pattern emerging from this conﬁguration changes when the immersion
height is a is increased.

So in the ﬁnal part of the paper we are interested in the new patterns

that emerge when changing the two parameters a and Ω.

In the following ﬁgures 8 we ﬁrst show the eﬀect of varying the immersion
depth from a = 0.2 to a = 0.8, leaving all other parameters as in the case
of the half-immersed disk with Ω = 1.0. We observe an emerging almost
symmetrical circular region where the ﬁlm height has a minimum. This
radius of the circular region increases with the immersion depth a. In fact,
the radius quite closely corresponds to the distance from the minimum of the
drag-in capillary wave to the vertical height of the rotation axis (a = 0, see
ﬁgure 1). By adjusting a one can therfore achieve thin and fairly constant
ﬁlm proﬁles.

When the angular velocity is increased, not only does the ﬂuid volume
on the disk increase but the circular region is shifted towards the left, where
the ﬁlm is dragged out. This is demonstrated in ﬁgure 9 for the case of
the immersion height a = 0.8. To see this eﬀect more clearly we compare

5 Conclusions

In this work we have derived a dimension-reduced generalized lubrication
model for the problem of the fully three-dimensional free-boundary problem
for the vertically rotating disk, dragging out a thin ﬁlm from a liquid bath.
The resulting two-dimensional nonlinear degenerate fourth-order boundary
value problem was solved numerically using a ﬁnite element scheme. For the
steady state solutions we performed an asymptotic analysis near the meniscus
region and a careful comparison with cross sections of the numerical solutions
along constant radii gave good agreement. Away from the liquid bath we
could show good agreement of our numerical solution with analytic solutions
of the corresponding hyperbolic problem.

For slightly immersed disks we observed patterns for the ﬁlm proﬁle on the
disk, which we studied as a function of the immersion depth and the angular
velocity. Interestingly, the dependence of surface area of the ﬁlm proﬁle and
of the volume ﬂuid dragged out is not trivial. Of course we only touched upon
the rich structure of possible patterns and outlined some general tendencies.
More detailed systematic study is subject of current research.
It is now
possible to ﬁnd optimum conﬁgurations that will be of importance for various

25

technological and industrial applications. For example, in PET-reactors the
ﬂuid mechanical problem is coupled to chemical reactions taking place mainly
on the ﬁlm surface, so that here it is important to obtain thin ﬁlms with high
surface area.

Assembling the global equation system The contributions of the ele-
ment coeﬃcient matrices and vectors (5.3)-(5.16) are added by the common
global node for the assembling of the global nonlinear equation system similar
to [6]. The global equation system can be written in the form

where U is constructed from the vectors hn+1 and pn+1 in all grid nodes.

R(U) = F,

(5.17)

Time stepping The time stepping algorithm is customarily implemented
with a Newton-Raphson equilibrium iteration loop. In the each time step
the following nonlinear problem must be solved

G(U) := R(U)

F = 0.

(5.18)

The linearized equation can be written on the basis of the Taylor expansion

G(Ui+1) = G(Ui) +

Ui+1.

At each step of Newton’s method, some direct or iterative method must
be used to solve the large linear algebra problem produced by the two-

Here, we ﬁnd it convenient to use the non-symmetric multi-frontal method
for large sparse linear systems from the packet UMFPACK [3].

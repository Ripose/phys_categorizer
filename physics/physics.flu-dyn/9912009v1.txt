A ﬂuid jet with a ﬁnite angular velocity is subject to centripetal forces in addition to surface
tension forces. At ﬁxed angular momentum, centripetal forces become large when the radius of the
jet goes to zero. We study the possible importance of this observation for the pinching of a jet within
a slender jet model. A linear stability analysis shows the model to break down at low viscosities.
Numerical simulations indicate that angular momentum is expelled from the pinch region so fast
that it becomes asymptotically irrelevant in the limit of the neck radius going to zero.

A ﬂuid jet emanating from a nozzle will become unstable and break up due to surface tension. Some 30 years ago,
a series of papers [1–4] investigated the modiﬁcations Rayleigh’s classical analysis would undergo if the jet performed
a solid-body rotation. Such a rotation is easily imparted by spinning the nozzle at the appropriate frequency. The
somewhat surprising result of the linear analysis is that the rotation always destabilizes the jet, a wavenumber k being
unstable if

Here γ is the surface tension, ρ the density, Ω the angular frequency, and r0 the unperturbed jet radius. Note that Ω
appears in the denominator, so no rotation corresponds to L → ∞, for which the stability boundary 0 < kr0 < 1 found
by Plateau is recovered. The theoretical growth rates were found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment [4]
and growth of disturbances for kr0 larger than 1 was conﬁrmed.

Recently it was pointed out by Nagel [5] that rotation might have an even more dramatic eﬀect for the highly
nonlinear motion near the point where the neck radius goes to zero. Assume for the sake of the argument that a
cylinder of ﬂuid of length w pinches uniformly, i.e. it retains its cylindrical shape. Then the total angular momentum
is

and the volume V = πr2
sponding to the outward centripetal force is found to be pc = ρr2

0Ω2/2, and thus

0w is constrained to remain constant as r0 goes to zero. The total interface pressure corre-

As r0 goes to zero, this outward pressure will dominate the surface tension pressure γ/r0, raising the possibility that
rotation is a singular perturbation for pinching: an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum, caused by a
symmetry breaking, could modify the breaking of a jet.

However, a jet does not pinch uniformly, but rather in a highly localized fashion [6]. If the above argument is applied
to pinching, it must correspond to a rapidly spinning thread of ﬂuid surrounded by almost stationary ﬂuid. Frictional
forces represented by the viscosity of the ﬂuid will lead to a diﬀusive transport of angular momentum out of the pinch
region, thus reducing its eﬀect. Determining which eﬀect dominates requires a fully nonlinear calculation, including
eﬀects of surface tension, viscosity, inertia, and centripetal forces. In the spirit of earlier work for Ω = 0 [7,8] we
will derive a one dimensional model, which only takes into account the leading order dependence of the velocity ﬁeld
on the radial variable. This will be done in the next section, together with a comparison of the linear growth rates
between the model and the full Navier-Stokes calculation. In the third section we analyze the nonlinear behavior.
First we investigate possible scaling solutions of the model equations, then we compare with numerical simulations.
In the ﬁnal section, we present some tentative conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

In our derivation of the slender jet model we closely follow [7]. The Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible

ﬂuid of viscosity ν read in cylindrical coordinates:

∂tvr + vr∂rvr + vz∂zvr − v

φ/r = −∂rp/ρ + ν(∂

),

with the incompressibility condition

∂rvr + ∂zvz + vr/r = 0.

Here we have assumed that the velocity ﬁeld does not depend on the angle φ. Exploiting incompressibility, vz and vr
can be expanded in a power series in r:

vz(z, r) = v0(z) + v2(z)r2 + . . .

Here and in the following a prime refers to diﬀerentiation with respect to z.

The crucial trick to make an expansion in r work in the presence of rotation is to rewrite vφ(z, r) in terms of the

angular momentum per unit length ℓ(z) of the corresponding solid body rotation:

Here h(z) is the local thread radius, hence no overturning of the proﬁle is allowed. Just as without rotation, the
equation of motion for h(z, t) follows from mass conservation based on the leading order expression for vz:

Finally, the pressure is expanded according to

Plugging this into the equation of motion for vr, to leading order in r one ﬁnds the balance

while the leading balance for the vz-equation remains

Equations (9)-(11) contain the unknown functions p0, v2, and b which need to be determined from the boundary

conditions. The normal stress balance nσn = γκ gives

where κ is the sum of the principal curvatures. As in the case without rotation, the tangential stress balance nσt = 0

The most obvious way to test this model is to compare with the known results for the stability of the full Navier-

where ¯k = kr0 and ¯ω = ω(ρr3
(γr0)1/2/(ρ1/2ν), based on a balance of capillary and viscous forces. Note that this convention diﬀers from that
of [4]. Putting ¯ω = 0 one reproduces the exact stability boundaries (1). However one can see that the inviscid limit
Re → ∞ is a very singular one, in disagreement with the full solution. Namely, for this limit one ﬁnds the three
branches

¯ω3 = Re

.

Thus ¯ω3 is the only unstable mode in the range 1 − L−1 < ¯k2 < 1 + L−1, but goes to zero when the viscosity becomes
small. The reason for this behavior, which is not found in the solution of the full equations, lies in the appearance of
a very thin boundary layer for small viscosities [3]. Namely, Rayleigh’s stability criterion for a rotating ﬂuid implies
that the interior of the ﬂuid is stabilized. This forces any disturbance to be conﬁned to a boundary layer of thickness

near the surface of the jet, and δ becomes very small for ¯k ≈ 1. But this additional length scale is not captured by
our slender jet expansion. Only for high viscosities is the boundary layer smoothed out suﬃciently, and from (14) one
ﬁnds the dispersion relation

which is consistent with the full theory in the limit of small ¯k.

III. NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR

Our main interest lies of course in the behavior close to pinch-oﬀ. Close to the singularity, one expects the motion
to become independent of initial conditions, so it is natural to write the equations of motion in units of the material

parameters of the ﬂuid alone. In addition to the known [9] units of length and time, ℓν = ν2ρ/γ and tν = ν3ρ2/γ2,
one ﬁnds an angular momentum scale ℓ0 = ν5ρ2/γ2. Note that this scale is only about 1.9 · 10−14 g cm/s for water,
corresponding to a frequency of 2 · 10−11s−1 for a 1 mm jet, so even the smallest amount of rotation will be potentially
relevant. Rewriting the equations of motion (12) in units of ℓν, tν , and ℓ0, one can eﬀectively put ρ = ν = γ = 1,
leading to a universal form of the equations, independent of the type of ﬂuid.

In addition, one can look for similarity solutions [11] of the form

h(z, t) = t
v(z, t) = t

(17)

where t′ = t0 − t and z′ = z − z0 are the temporal and spatial distances from the singularity where h goes to zero.
We have assumed that everything has been written in units of the natural scales ℓν, tν, and ℓ0. By plugging (17) into
the equations of motion, and looking for solutions that balance the t′-dependence, one ﬁnds a unique set of values for
the exponents:

α1 = 1, α2 = −1/2, α3 = 5/2,

β = 1/2.

In addition, one obtains a set of three ordinary diﬀerential equations for the similarity functions φ, ψ, and χ. So far
we have not been able to ﬁnd consistent solutions to these equations, which match onto a solution which is static on
the time scale t′ of the singular motion. This is a necessary requirement since the ﬂuid will not be able to follow the
singular motion as one moves away from the pinch point.

This negative result is consistent with simulations of the equations for a variety of initial conditions. To avoid
spurious boundary eﬀects, we considered a solution of (12) with periodic boundary conditions in the interval [−1, 1]
and an additional symmetry around the origin. This ensures that the total angular momentum is conserved exactly.
We took the ﬂuid to be initially at rest and the surface to be

with r0 = 0.1. The angular momentum was distributed uniformly with the initial value ℓinit, corresponding to

hinit(z) = r0(1 + 0.3 cos(2πx)),

Figures 1 and 2 show a numerical simulation of (12) with Re = 4.5 and L = 0.25 using a numerical code very
similar to the one described in [12]. Written in units of the intrinsic angular momentum scale, ℓinit/ℓ0 = 6 · 103, so
ℓ is potentially relevant. The thread pinches on either side of the minimum, pushing ﬂuid into the center. As seen
in the proﬁles of ℓ, the angular momentum is expelled very rapidly from the regions where h goes to zero and also
concentrates in the center. This is conﬁrmed by a plot of the minimum of ℓ versus the minimum of h. On the basis of
5/2
the similarity solution (17), a power law ℓmin ∝ h
min is to be expected. Instead, Fig. 3 shows that ℓmin decays more
rapidly, making angular momentum asymptotically irrelevant. Indeed, a comparison of the similarity function φ as
found from the present simulation shows perfect agreement with the scaling theory in the absence of rotation [11]. The
behavior of ℓmin should in principal be derivable from the linear equation for ℓ with known time-dependent functions
h(z, t) and v(z, t). Unfortunately, ℓmin does not seem to follow a simple scaling law except below h = 3 · 10−4, where
the power is close to 3.13. It is not clear how to extract this power analytically.

One might think that by increasing the angular momentum the system would cross over to a diﬀerent behavior. To
test this, the initial angular momentum was doubled to give L = 0.0625. At L = 0.5 centripetal and surface tension
forces are balanced, so decreasing L signiﬁcantly below this value will cause rotation to be important initially. Indeed,
instead of pinching down immediately, the ﬂuid is ﬁrst pulled into a narrow disc, while the radius of the surrounding
ﬂuid remains constant, cf. Fig. 4. Eventually this outward motion stops, as surface tension and centripetal forces
reach an equilibrium. Only then does the ﬂuid pinch down at the edge of the disc. The behavior close to the pinch
point is however exactly the same as for smaller angular momentum. As a word of caution, one must add that our
model is certainly not valid at the edges of the disk, where slopes become very large. In fact, the very sharp gradients
encountered in this region may be due to the fact that the ﬂuid really wants to develop plumes. As is observed for low
viscosity [12], the viscous terms prevent the interface from overturning, but at the cost of producing unrealistically
sharp gradients.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The present investigation is only a ﬁrst step towards the understanding of the role of rotation in droplet pinching.
A major challenge lies in ﬁnding a description valid at low viscosities. This can perhaps be done by incorporating the
boundary layer structure near the surface into the slender jet approximation. The relevance of this lies in the fact
that angular momentum is potentially more important at low viscosities, when there is less frictional transport out
of the pinch region. In fact it can be shown that the inviscid version of (12) does not describe breakup at all, since
centripetal forces will always dominate asymptotically. This result is of course only of limited use since the model
equations are deﬁnitely ﬂawed in that regime.

In addition, there remains the possibility that a region in parameter space exists where angular momentum modiﬁes
breakup even at ﬁnite viscosities. We cannot make a deﬁnite statement since the additional variable makes it hard
to scan parameter space completely. Finally, spinning jets have not received much attention in terms of experiments
probing the non-linear regime. The discs found at high spinning rates (cf. Fig. 4) are a tantalizing new feature, and
to our knowledge have not been found experimentally. The lowest value of L reported in [4] is 0.43, which is even
larger than the value of Fig. 1. However, 0.0625 would easily be reachable by increasing the jet radius.

Abstract

The so-called ’direct’ approach to separation of variables in linear PDEs is applied to the hy-

drodynamic stability problem. Calculations are made for the complete linear stability equations

in cylindrical coordinates. Several classes of the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations

describing spatially developing and unsteady ﬂows, for which the linear stability problems can be

rigorously reduced to eigenvalue problems of ordinary diﬀerential equations, are deﬁned. Those ex-

actly solvable nonparallel and unsteady ﬂow stability problems can be used for testing approximate

approaches and the methods based on direct numerical simulations of the (linearized) Navier-Stokes

equations. The exact solutions of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations determined

as the basic states, for which the linear stability problem is exactly separable, may be themselves

of interest from theoretical and engineering points of view.

INTRODUCTION

The classical linear stability theory of viscous incompressible ﬂows is concerned with

the development in space and time of inﬁnitesimal perturbations around a given basic ﬂow.

Then small disturbances are resolved into normal modes which, for a steady-state basic ﬂow,

depend on time exponentially with a complex exponent λ. For parallel shear basic ﬂows,

further separation of variables in the governing stability equations leads to a set of ordinary

diﬀerential equations which, with taking recourse to Squire’s theorem and considering only

2-D disturbances, reduces to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. When this equation is solved

with proper boundary conditions, the problem of linear stability of parallel ﬂows is reduced

to a 2-point boundary (eigen) value problem.

For nonparallel basic ﬂows, when the equations for disturbance ﬂow are dependent not

only on the normal coordinate, the corresponding operator does not separate unless certain

terms are ignored. The approximation, that neglects the nonparallel terms and relates the

stability characteristics to those of the equivalent parallel ﬂow. has been extensively used

for the boundary layer type ﬂows to retain the great advantage of reducing the disturbance

equations to ordinary diﬀerential equations (see, e.g., Reed and Saric, 1996). A number

of weakly nonparallel theories, which seek to account for the aﬀects of the ﬂow divergence

through equations that include higher-order terms than those in the Orr-Sommerfeld equa-

tion, have been developed (see reviews in Reed and Saric, 1996; Herbert 1997; Saric et al.

2003).

It is worth mentioning, in this context, the works on stability of conical ﬂows by Shtern

and Hussain (1998), Shtern and Drazin (2000) where an exact transformation, reducing the

stability problem to an ordinary diﬀerential equation despite the non-parallelism of the basic

ﬂow, is found. However, the advantage of such a transformation in the analysis is limited

to the particular class of steady perturbation modes.

In Shtern and Hussain (2003), the

approach of Shtern and Hussain (1998) has been applied to the time-oscillatory disturbances

by using a far-ﬁeld approximation in the equations for the disturbances.

Several methods have been designed for numerical solution of the nonparallel ﬂow stability

problems. In the context of boundary-layer type ﬂows, the most successful eﬀort to-date

is the parabolic-stability-equation (PSE) approach, introduced and recently reviewed by

Herbert (1997). However, the PSE based numerical studies are not able to accommodate

2

the upstream propagation of disturbances. The ’global’ linear stability analysis (see review

by Theoﬁlis 2003) was developed for analyzing stability of the two-dimensional ﬂows. The

nonparallel stability eﬀects have been also investigated on the basis of direct numerical

simulations of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations (e.g., Davies and Carpentier 2003) or

the complete Navier-Stokes equations (e.g., Fazel and Konzelmann 1990). Such numerical

simulations are not equivalent to a stability analysis, and, in fact, have more in common with

physical experiments than stability theory. The numerical methods suﬀer from the problem

of boundary conditions on the ’open’, inﬂow and outﬂow, boundaries which (especially

outﬂow boundary conditions) can lead to spiritus eﬀects, even when carefully implemented.

If the basic ﬂow is non-steady, this brings about great diﬃculties in theoretical studies

of the instability since the method of normal modes in its traditional form, with the modes

depending on time as exp(λt), is not applicable at all. (Some success has been achieved in

studying stability of the time-periodic basic states when Floquet theory can be applied -

see Drazin and Reid 1981.) If an unsteady ﬂow is non-parallel, it should further complicate

matters. As a matter of fact, there are no examples of the linear stability problem for

viscous incompressible ﬂows developing both in space and time which is exactly solvable via

separation of variables.

Recently, the so-called direct approach to separation of variables in linear PDEs has been

developed by a proper formalizing the features of the notion of separation of variables (see,

e.g., Zhdanov and Zhalij 1999a, 1999b). In this approach, a form of the ’ans¨atz’ for a solution

with separated variables in a new coordinate system as well as a form of reduced ODEs, that

should be obtained as a result of the variable separation, are postulated from the beginning.

The method has been successfully applied to several equations of mathematical physics (see,

e.g., Zhalij, 1999; Zhdanov and Zhalij, 1999a, 1999b; Zhalij, 2002).

In the present paper, we apply this approach to the linear stability equations which govern

the disturbance behavior in viscous incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows. The calculations are made

for the linear stability equations written in cylindrical coordinates. The new coordinate

systems and the forms of basic ﬂows, which permit the postulated form of separation of

variables in the equations for disturbances, are determined as the result of application of

the method. Then the basic ﬂows are speciﬁed by the requirement that they exactly satisfy

the Navier-Stokes equations.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give a description of the method,

3

as applied to the problem of linear stability of a three-dimensional unsteady basic ﬂow

with respect to the three-dimensional unsteady perturbations, and present the results. An

example of application of the method to the linear stability equations with a restriction

to the two-dimensional perturbations is also presented. In Section III, we discuss the ﬂuid

dynamics interpretation of some basic ﬂows, deﬁned in Section II as the exact solutions of

the Navier-Stokes equations possessing exactly solvable stability problems, and formulate

the corresponding two-point boundary value problems of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

Concluding remarks on the results obtained are furnished in Section IV.

II. APPLICATION OF THE DIRECT METHOD TO SEPARATION OF VARI-

ABLES IN THE STABILITY EQUATIONS

A. Procedure

We formulate the linear stability problem based on the Navier-Stokes equations written

in cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z). As usual in stability analysis, we split the velocity and

pressure ﬁelds (ˆvr, ˆvϕ, ˆvz, ˆp) into two problems: the basic ﬂow problem (Vr, Vϕ, Vz, P ) and a

perturbation one (vr, vϕ, vz, p),

ˆvr = Vr + vr,

ˆvϕ = Vϕ + vϕ,

ˆvz = Vz + vz,

ˆp = P + p

(1)

Introducing (1) into the Navier-Stokes equation written in terms of the variables (ˆvr, ˆvϕ, ˆvz, ˆp)

and neglecting all terms that involve the square of the perturbation amplitude while imposing

the requirement that the basic ﬂow variables (Vr, Vϕ, Vz, P ) themselves satisfy the Navier-

Stokes equations, one arrives at the following set of linear stability equations in cylindrical

coordinates:

Let us introduce a new coordinate system t, ξ = ξ(t, r), γ = γ(t, ϕ), η = η(t, z).

We will say that the system (2) is separable in the non-stationary cylindrical coordinate

system ξ, γ, η if the separation ans¨atz,

vr = T (t) exp(aη + mγ + sS(t))f (ξ),

vϕ = T (t) exp(aη + mγ + sS(t))g(ξ),

(3)

vz = T (t) exp(aη + mγ + sS(t))h(ξ),

p = T1(t) exp(aη + mγ + sS(t))π(ξ)

reduces the system of PDEs (2) to a system of three second-order and one ﬁrst order ordinary

diﬀerential equations for four functions f (ξ), g(ξ), h(ξ), π(ξ) of the following form

h′′(ξ) = U11g′(ξ) + U12h′(ξ) + U13π′(ξ) + U14f (ξ) + U15g(ξ) + U16h(ξ) + U17π(ξ),

f ′′(ξ) = U21g′(ξ) + U22h′(ξ) + U23π′(ξ) + U24f (ξ) + U25g(ξ) + U26h(ξ) + U27π(ξ), (4)

g′′(ξ) = U31g′(ξ) + U32h′(ξ) + U33π′(ξ) + U34f (ξ) + U35g(ξ) + U36h(ξ) + U37π(ξ),

f ′(ξ) = U41f (ξ) + U42g(ξ) + U43h(ξ) + U44π(ξ).

Here Uij are second order polynomials with respect to spectral parameters a, s, m with

coeﬃcients, which are some smooth functions on ξ.

Note, that equations (3)-(4) form the input data of the method. We can change these

conditions and thereby modify the deﬁnition of separation of variables. For instance, we

can change the order of the reduced equations (4) or the number of essential parameters

a, s, m. So, our claim of obtaining the complete description of basic ﬂows and non-stationary

coordinate systems providing separation of variables in (2) makes sense only within the

framework of the given deﬁnition. If one uses a more general deﬁnition, it might be possible

to construct new coordinate systems and basic ﬂows providing separability of the system

(2).

The principal steps of the procedure of variable separation in the system (2) are as follows.

5

1. We insert the ans¨atz (3) into equation (2) and express the derivatives f ′′(ξ), g′′(ξ),

h′′(ξ), f ′(ξ), in terms of functions g′(ξ), h′(ξ), π′(ξ), f (ξ), g(ξ), h(ξ), π(ξ) using equa-

tions (4).

2. We regard g′(ξ), h′(ξ), π′(ξ), f (ξ), g(ξ), h(ξ), π(ξ) as the new independent variables.

As the functions ξ(t, r), γ(t, ϕ), η(t, z), T (t), T1(t), S(t), basic ﬂows Vr, Vϕ, Vz and coeﬃ-

cients of the polynomials Uij (which are some smooth functions on ξ) are independent

on these variables, we can demand that the obtained equality is transformed into

identity under arbitrary g′(ξ), h′(ξ), π′(ξ), f (ξ), g(ξ), h(ξ), π(ξ). In other words, we

should split the equality with respect to these variables. After splitting we get an

overdetermined system of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations for unknown func-

tions ξ(t, r), γ(t, ϕ), η(t, z), T (t), T1(t), S(t), basic ﬂows Vr, Vϕ, Vz and coeﬃcients of the

polynomials Uij.

3. After solving the above system we get an exhaustive description of coordinate systems

providing separability of equations (2) according to our deﬁnition.

Thus, the problem of variable separation in equation (2) reduces to integrating the overde-

termined system of PDEs for unknown functions ξ(t, r), γ(t, ϕ), η(t, z), T (t), T1(t), S(t), basic

ﬂows Vr, Vϕ, Vz and coeﬃcients of the polynomials Uij. This have been done with the aid of

Mathematica package.

B. Results

We will consider the stability problems with separated variables for the basic ﬂows spec-

iﬁed by the requirement that they exactly satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations.

2. Two-dimensional perturbations

The stability properties of a given ﬂow may be tested by considering perturbations of

speciﬁc structures. For example, the problem may be restricted to the two-dimensional

perturbations even though an analog of the Squire theorem cannot be proved (see, e.g.,

Griﬀond and Casalis 2001, Joslin 1996), or the perturbation ﬂow ﬁeld may be taken to

have the same general form as the basic state (Duck and Dry 2001). Although the stability

analysis restricted to perturbations of speciﬁc forms is not complete, it enables one to show

that the ﬂow is susceptible to a special kind of instability. To demonstrate that a speciﬁcation

of the disturbance ﬁeld may lead to new possibilities we consider the results of application of

the direct method to the linear stability equations with a restriction to the two-dimensional

perturbations with vz = 0 and vr and vφ not dependent on z.

The separability analysis leads to the perturbations of the form

vr = T (t) exp

mϕ + s

III. SPECIFIC FLOW STABILITY PROBLEMS

In this section, we will discuss the ﬂuid dynamics interpretation of some basic ﬂows, de-

ﬁned above as the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for which the correspond-

ing stability problems are exactly separable, and will formulate the corresponding two-point

boundary value problems.

We will consider particular cases of the class of the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes

equations in cylindrical coordinates identiﬁed in Section IIB1 as Class I. It is possible to

enrich the solution deﬁned by the formulas (6) - (10) using the invariance of the solution

This system can be reduced to a system of two third-order equations for two functions (f (ζ)

and g(ζ), for example).

The above formulas (14)-(23) remain valid if we introduce the nondimensional variables,

with the time scale 1/

and the correspondingly deﬁned velocity scale. In the dimensionless

b
|

|

equations (we will retain the same notation for the nondimensional variables), the parameter

b takes one of the two values: b = 1 or b =

1, and ν is replaced by 1/Re where Re is the

Reynolds number.

Note that the solution (14) - (15) for b = 1 undergos the ﬁnite-time ’breakdown’ (see, e.g.,

Duck and Dry 2001, Hall et al. 1992) and the ’normal mode’ forms (21)-(22) are naturally

adjusted to the description of the disturbed ﬂow as the breakdown time t = 1 is approached.

Next we will consider several two-point boundary value problems corresponding diﬀerent

speciﬁcations of the basic ﬂow (14)-(19).

(i) Axially symmetrical stagnation-point type flows. These are the simplest basic

ﬂows, that are obtained from (14)-(15) by setting

F (ζ) = 0, M(ζ) = 0, c(t) = 0, k = 0.

FIG. 1: Unsteady axially symmetric stagnation point ﬂows: b = 1 (left), b =

1 (right)

In the case of b = 1, the solution describes impingement of two axially opposite stagnation

point ﬂows with velocities growing with time, and, in the case of b =

1, the solution

describes the ﬂow where ﬂuid ﬂowing radially from inﬁnity approaches the axis and spreads

along it, with the ﬂow velocity decreasing with time as (1 + t)−1 (Fig. 1). In both cases, the

boundary conditions to equations (23) are set at the axis ζ = 0 and at ζ =

, as follows

f (0) = 0, g(0) = 0, h′(0) = 0;

f (

r = R, where V = dR/dt = 1

If the cylinder surface is impermeable, then using the boundary condition Vr = V at

V0, where V0 is a constant deﬁning

k = 3/4. In the case of porous cylinder. we have k = 3/4

a magnitude of the suction (V0 > 0) or injection (V0 < 0) velocity as Vs = V0(1 + t)−1/2

Since the domain is inﬁnite in radial direction, it should be set c3 = 0 in the expression
(20) for F ′(ζ) not to have an unbounded behavior for F (ζ) at inﬁnity. (The incomplete

and

a behavior of F (ζ) itself for speciﬁc values of k = 2nν, with n being a positive integer, when

closed-form solutions of equation (16) for F (ζ) can be found.) Then the ﬂow at inﬁnity

represents a combination of a stagnation point ﬂow and a uniform stream, and the two

constants in the expression for F (ζ) are determined from the boundary condition Vz = U at

r = R (F (1) = 0) and the condition for the uniform part of the ﬂow velocity at inﬁnity be

of the form U∞/√1 + t where U∞ is a constant.

For not swirling ﬂows (a swirl can be also added with the swirl velocity deﬁned by (14) and

(19)) we have the following to be introduced into the equations for perturbations (21)-(23):

one, b =

stretches according to the law U = Kz where K = 1

1, the radius of the cylinder changes with time as R = √1 + t and the surface
2 (1 + t)−1. The diﬀerence is in that the
ﬂuid is now inside the cylinder and there is an injection of ﬂuid through the porous pipe

surface, which may be either normal to the surface or oblique, with the blowing velocity

varying with time as Vb = V0(1 + t)−1/2, where V0 is a constant.

The conditions Vr = 0 at r = 0 requires k = 0 and using the condition ∂Vz/∂r = 0 at

r = 0 in (20) yields

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Several classes of the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations describing spatially

developing and unsteady ﬂows, for which the linear stability problems can be rigorously

reduced to eigenvalue problems of ordinary diﬀerential equations, have been deﬁned. Those

exactly solvable nonparallel and unsteady ﬂow stability problems can provide a necessary

foundation for a number approximate approaches used in the stability analysis so far. The

results can be also used for testing the methods based on direct numerical simulations

of the (linearized) Navier-Stokes equations. Note that the basic ﬂows considered in the

paper belong to the category of the so-called ’open’ ﬂows (see, e.g., Huerre and Monkewitz

1990), for which the numerical instability simulations can be quite challenging because of

the problem of boundary conditions on the inﬂow and outﬂow boundaries.

It is worth remarking that the general forms of the basic ﬂows, which have been obtained

from the only requirement of separability of the corresponding stability problem, are reacher

1

17

than those remaining after speciﬁcation to the exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equa-

tions. Thus, using the approach accepted in many stability studies, where the form of the

basic ﬂow is chosen quite freely to approximate the physical situation of interest, we could

considerably enrich the list of relevant ﬂows. However, our purpose was to provide exam-

ples of a completely rigorous analysis that reduced the stability problem to an eigenvalue

problem of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

In addition, note that we have not yet exhausted the ”direct approach” to separation of

variables in the hydrodynamic stability equations. Changing the input data of the method

given by equations (3)-(4) may lead to new results. We considered here only the most natural

generalization of the normal modes of the steady-state parallel ﬂow analysis, which allows

periodicity of perturbations in two new variables, and the order of the reduced equations

was taken the same as that obtained in the parallel ﬂow stability problem.

If one uses

other input data, it might be possible to construct new coordinate systems and basic ﬂows

providing separability of the system (2).

We will also remark on the practical importance of speciﬁc basic ﬂows that have been

deﬁned in the course of our analysis (some of them are discussed in the previous section).

Those ﬂows, mainly, are either ones over the stretching surfaces or the ﬂows within porous

channels possessing moving walls. The description of the ﬂow near a stretching surface has

many important applications in manufacturing processes in industry. A literature on the

subject (see, e.g., the book by Pop and Ingham 2001) shows considerable research activities

in this area. Solutions for physical situations, close to those considered in our Section III,

can be found, for example, in Burde (1995a, 1995b), Youssef (1997), Nahapatra and Gupta

(2003), Nazar et al. (2004).

Laminar, incompressible and time-dependent ﬂows that develop within a channel possess-

ing permeable, moving walls have received considerable attention in the past due to their

relevance in a number of engineering applications. Instances of direct application of such

ﬂows include the modeling of sweat cooling or heating, isotope separation, ﬁltration, pa-

per manufacturing, irrigation, and the grain regression during solid propellant combustion.

From a diﬀerent perspective, the sequences of expansions and contractions completed by

channel walls enable a researcher to mimic more realistically peristaltic motion caused by

pulsating walls and involving ﬂuid absorbtion and ﬁltration processes. For the cases, similar

to those considered in the present paper, which pertain to a pipe that exhibits either injec-

18

tion or suction across porous boundaries while undergoing uniform expansion or contraction

see, e.g., Uchida and Aoki (1977), Goto and Uchida (1990), Majdalani and Zhou (2003),

Dauenhauer and Majdalani (2003).

Thus, the exact solutions of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations deter-

mined in this paper as the basic states, for which the linear stability problem is exactly

separable, may be themselves of interest from both theoretical and engineering points of

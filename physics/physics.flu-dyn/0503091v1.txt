(Dated: October 28, 2013)

We study the homogeneous and the spatially periodic instabilities in a nematic liquid crystal layer

subjected to steady plane Couette or Poiseuille ﬂow. The initial director orientation is perpendicular

to the ﬂow plane. Weak anchoring at the conﬁning plates and the inﬂuence of the external electric

and/or magnetic ﬁeld are taken into account. Approximate expressions for the critical shear rate

are presented and compared with semi-analytical solutions in case of Couette ﬂow and numerical

solutions of the full set of nematodynamic equations for Poiseuille ﬂow. In particular the dependence

of the type of instability and the threshold on the azimuthal and the polar anchoring strength and

external ﬁelds is analysed.

In this paper we study the combined action of steady

ﬂow (Couette and Poiseuille) and external ﬁelds (electric

and magnetic) on the orientational instabilities of the ne-

matics with initial orientation perpendicular to the ﬂow

plane. We focus on ﬂow-aligning nematics. The external

electric ﬁeld is applied across the nematic layer and the

external magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicular to the

The values of the integrals h. . . i appearing in the expres-

sion (46) are given in Appendix C.

In the case of strong anchoring an approximate analyti-

cal expression for a2

c(qc) was obtained by Manneville
[14] using test functions that satisfy free-slip boundary

c = a2

conditions. The formula (46) is more accurate because

we chose for v1z Chandrasekhar functions that satisfy the

boundary conditions (19).

For calculations we used material parameters for

MBBA. The accuracy of (46) is better than 1% for Cou-

ette ﬂow and better than 3% for Poiseuille ﬂow. Note,

that Eq. (42) for the homogeneous instability is more

accurate than (46) for q = 0 because (46) was obtained

by solving four equations (10) by approximating all vari-

ables, whereas (42) was obtained by solving the reduced

equations (24) by approximating only two variables.

V. DISCUSSION

For the calculations we used parameters for MBBA
at 25 ◦C [15]. Calculations were made for the range of

anchoring strengths βa = 0 ÷ 1 and βp = 0 ÷ 1.

We found that without and with an additional electric

ﬁeld the critical shear rate a2

c for the “even” type ho-
mogeneous instability (EH) is systematically lower than

the threshold for other types of instability (Fig. 2a–c).

Note, that in the presence of the ﬁeld the symmetry with

respect to the exchange βa ↔ βp is broken.

In Fig. 2 contour plots for the critical value a2

c vs.
anchoring strengths βa and βp for diﬀerent values of the
electric ﬁeld are shown. The diﬀerences between a2

c ob-
tained from the exact, semi-analytical solution (35) and

from the one-mode approximation (42) are indistinguish-

able in the ﬁgure.

creases with increasing magnetic ﬁeld and decreases with

decreasing anchoring strengths. With increasing mag-

less sensitive to the surface anchoring. Leslie has pointed

out (using an approximate analytical approach) that for

strong anchoring a transition from a homogeneous state

without transverse ﬂow (EH) to one with such ﬂow (OH)

as the magnetic ﬁeld is increased is not possible in MBBA

because of the appearance of the ER type instability [12].

This is consistent with our results. We ﬁnd that the EH–

OH transition in MBBA is possible only in the region of

weak anchoring (Figs. 3a–c).

suspect that the discrepancy is due to deviations from the

strong anchoring limit and the diﬀerence in the material

The one-mode approximations (42) and (46) not give the

transition to EH for strong anchoring. Here we should

note that in that region the diﬀerence between the EH

and the OR instability thresholds is only about 5%. By

varying material parameters [increase α2 by 10% or de-

crease α3 by 20% or α5 by 25% or K33 by 35%] it is

possible to change the type of instability in that region.

Application of an electric ﬁeld leads for εa < 0 (εa > 0)

to expansion (contraction) of the EH region [Figs. 5b and

5c]. At E0/EF = 1 and εa < 0 rolls vanish completely

and the EH instability occurs in the whole area investi-

gated. For εa > 0 the instability of OH type appears in

the region of large βp. In this case, increasing the electric
ﬁeld from Eweak

to EF cause an expansion of the OH re-

HOMOGENEOUS INSTABILITY

Eq. (46) with q = 0 gives 130]. The experimental value is

92 [16]. Thus, theoretical calculations and experimental

results are in good agreement. Note, that in the exper-

iments [16] actually not steady but oscillatory ﬂow with
very low frequency was used (f = 5 · 10−3 Hz).

In summary, the orientational instabilities for both

steady Couette (semi-analytical for homogeneous insta-

bility and numerical for rolls) and Poiseuille ﬂow (numer-

ical) were analysed rigorously taking into account weak

anchoring and the inﬂuence of external ﬁelds. Easy-to-

use expressions for the threshold of all possible types of

instabilities were obtained and compared with the rigor-

ous calculations. In particular the region in parameter

space where the diﬀerent types of instabilities occurred

were determined.

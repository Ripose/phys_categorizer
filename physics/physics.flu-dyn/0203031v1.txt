Markovian models of turbulence can be derived from the renormalized statistical closure equa-
tions of the direct-interaction approximation (DIA). Various simpliﬁcations are often introduced,
including an assumption that the two-time correlation function is proportional to the renormalized
inﬁnitesimal propagator (Green’s function), i.e. the decorrelation rate for ﬂuctuations is equal to the
decay rate for perturbations. While this is a rigorous result of the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem
for thermal equilibrium, it does not necessarily apply to all types of turbulence. Building on previous
work on realizable Markovian closures, we explore a way to allow the decorrelation and decay rates
to diﬀer (which in some cases aﬀords a more accurate treatment of eﬀects such as non-white noise),
while retaining the computational advantages of a Markovian approximation. Some Markovian
approximations diﬀer only in the initial transient phase, but the multiple-rate Markovian closure
(MRMC) presented here could modify the steady-state spectra as well. Markovian models can be
used directly in studying turbulence in a wide range of physical problems (including zonal ﬂows,
of recent interest in plasma physics), or they may be a useful starting point for deriving subgrid
turbulence models for computer simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Our derivation builds on and closely follows the work
by Bowman, Krommes, and Ottaviani1 (we will fre-
quently refer to this paper as BKO), on realizable
Markovian closures derived from Kraichnan’s direct-
interaction-approximation (the DIA). The DIA is based
on a renormalized perturbation theory and gives an
integro-diﬀerential set of equations to determine the two-
time correlation function. The DIA involves time inte-
grals over the past history of the system, which can be
computationally expensive. Markovian approximations
give a simpler set of diﬀerential equations that involve
only information from the present time. They approx-
imate two-time information in the correlation function
and in the renormalized Green’s function by a decorrela-
tion rate parameter. The structure of the equations we
derive here is similar to the realizable Markovian closure
(RMC) of BKO,1 but with extensions such as replacing a
single decorrelation rate parameter with several diﬀerent
nonlinear rate parameters, to allow for a more accurate
model of eﬀects such as non-white noise.
(As will be
discussed more below, the RMC does include more non-
white-noise eﬀects than one might think at ﬁrst.)

The basic issue studied in the present paper can be
illustrated by a simple Langevin equation (which will be
discussed in more detail in the next section):

where η is the decay rate and f is a random forcing or stir-

white noise, then the decorrelation rate for ψ is given by
η, so that in a statistical steady state the two-time corre-
lation function

compared to the 1/η time scale, then the solution to the
Langevin equation is just ψ(t)
f (t)/η, and the decorre-
lation rate for ψ is instead given by the decorrelation rate
for f . Note that the Green’s function (the response to a

perturbation at time t′) is still exp(
Markovian closures employed some variant of an ansatz,
based on the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem, that the
two-time correlation function and the Green’s function
were proportional to each other. This is a rigorous re-
sult for a system in thermal equilibrium, but may not
necessarily apply to a turbulent system. The purpose of
the present paper is to explore an extended Markovian
closure, which we will call the Multiple-Rate Markovian
Closure (MRMC), that allows the decorrelation rate of
ψ to diﬀer from the decay rate η.

In practice, the corrections due to non-white-noise ef-
fects may be quantitatively modest, as the decorrelation
rate for the turbulent noise f that is driving ψ at a par-
ticular wave number k is often comparable to or greater
than the nonlinear damping rate η at that k. This is
because the turbulent noise driving mode k arises from

the nonlinear beating of other modes p and q such that

has to be comparable to

larger decorrelation rates, since the decay rate η is usu-
ally an increasing function of
. Furthermore, there
|
are some oﬀsetting eﬀects due to the time-history inte-
grals in the DIA’s generalized Langevin equation that
might further reduce the diﬀerence between the decay
rate and the decorrelation rate.
Indeed, past compar-
isons of the RMC with the full DIA or with the full non-
linear dynamics have generally found fairly good agree-
ment in many cases,1–4 including two-ﬁeld Hasegawa–
Wakatani drift-wave turbulence5,6 and galactic dynamo
MHD turbulence.7 Some of the results in this paper help
to give a deeper insight into why this agreement is of-
ten fairly good, despite the arguments of the previous
paragraph, i.e., why the ﬂuctuation–dissipation ansatz
is often a reasonable approximation even out of ther-
mal equilibrium. But there may be some regimes where
the diﬀerences are important and the improvements sug-
gested here would be welcome. These might include in-
clude plasma cases where the wave dynamics can make
η vary strongly with the direction of k in some cases
(with strong Landau damping in some directions and
strong instabilities in other directions, for example), or
non-steady-state cases involving zonal ﬂows exhibiting
predator-prey dynamics.
Markovian closures

the test-ﬁeld model
such as
(TFM) or Orszag’s eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian
(EDQNM) closure have been extensively used to study
turbulence in incompressible ﬂuids and plasmas. The
introduction of BKO1 provides useful discussions of the
background of the DIA and Markovian closures, and we
will add just a few remarks here (there are also many
reviews on these topics, such as Refs. 3,8–12). The RMC
developed in BKO1 is similar to the EDQNM, but has
features that ensure realizability even in the presence of
the linear wave phenomena exhibited by plasmas (e.g.
drift waves) and rotating planetary ﬂows (e.g. Rossby
waves). “Realizability” is a property of a statistical clo-
sure approximation that ensures that, even though it is
only an approximate solution of the original equations,
it is an exact solution to some other underlying stochas-
tic equation, such as a Langevin equation. The absence
of realizability can cause serious physical and numerical
problems, such as the prediction of negative or even di-
vergent energies. The RMC reduces to the DIA-based
version of the EDQNM in a statistical steady state, so
in some cases the issue of realizability is only important
in the transient phase as a steady state is approached or
in freely decaying turbulence. Realizability may also be
important in certain cases of recent interest among fusion
researchers where oscillations may occur between various
parts of the spectrum (such as predator–prey type oscil-
lations between drift waves and zonal ﬂows13,14) where a
simple statistical steady state might not exist, or where
one is interested in the transient dynamics. Unlike some
Markovian models that diﬀer only in the transient dy-

2

namics, the Multiple-Rate Markovian Closure presented
here could also alter the steady-state spectrum.

Our results apply to a Markovian approximation of
the DIA for a generic one-ﬁeld system with a quadratic
nonlinearity. They are immediately applicable to some
simple drift-wave plasma turbulence problems, Rossby-
wave problems, or two-dimensional hydrodynamics. Fu-
ture work could extend this approach to multiple ﬁelds,
similar to the covariant multiﬁeld RMC of BKO1 or their
later realizable test-ﬁeld model.2 Multiple ﬁeld equations
can get computationally diﬃcult (with the compute time
scaling as n6, where n is the number of ﬁelds), though
two-ﬁeld studies have been done6 and disparate scale
approximations15 or other approximations16 might make
them more tractable.
In addition to their direct use
in studying turbulence in a wide range of systems, the
Markovian closures discussed here might also be use-
ful in deriving subgrid turbulence models for computer
simulations.17,18

While our formulation is general and potentially ap-
plicable to a wide range of nonlinear problems involving
Markovian approximations, we were motivated by some
recent problems of interest in plasma physics and fusion
energy research, such as zonal ﬂows.19–22 Initial analytic
work elucidating the essentials of nonlinear zonal ﬂow
generation used weak-turbulence approximations23,24 or
secondary-instability analysis.25 Recent interesting work
by Krommes and Kim15 uses a Markovian statistical the-
ory to extend the study of zonal ﬂows to the strong tur-
bulence regime. An important question is why the strong
generation of zonal ﬂows seen near marginal stability is
not as important in stronger instability regimes (i.e., why
is the Dimits nonlinear shift ﬁnite?).26–28 A strong tur-
bulence theory is needed to study this. An alternative
approach,27,28 which has been fruitful in providing the
main answers to the ﬁnite Dimits shift question, is to
analyze the secondary and tertiary instabilities involved
in the generation and breakup of zonal ﬂows. That work
suggests that a complete strong-turbulence Markovian
model of this problem would also need multi-ﬁeld and
geometrical eﬀects (involving at least the potential and
temperature ﬁelds, along with certain neoclassical eﬀects
in toroidal magnetic ﬁeld geometry).

Based on the reasoning immediately following Eq. (1)
above, one might think that the assumption that the two-
time correlation function and the Green’s function are
proportional to each other is rigorous only in the limit
of white noise (which has an inﬁnite decorrelation rate).
The Realizable Markovian Closure has been shown to
correspond exactly to a simple Langevin equation (where
the eﬀects of the turbulence appear in nonlinear damping
and nonlinear noise terms), for which this might appear
to be the implication. However, the mapping from statis-
tically averaged equations (such as Markovian closures)
back to a stochastic equation for which it is the solution,
is not necessarily unique. In particular, the full DIA cor-
responds to a generalized Langevin equation (Eq. (40)
below), in which the damping term ηψ(t) in the sim-

ple Langevin equation is replaced by a time-history in-
tegral operator. As we will ﬁnd, it is then possible for
the two-time correlation function and the Green’s func-
tion to be proportional to each other even when the noise
has a ﬁnite correlation time. This allows the ﬂuctuation–
dissipation theorem (which is rigorous in thermal equi-
librium) to be satisﬁed without requiring the noise to be
white (since the noise is not necessarily white in thermal
equilibrium). Thus the ﬂuctuation–dissipation ansatz of
BKO is a less restrictive assumption than one might have
at ﬁrst thought. [It should be noted that previous Marko-
vian models account implicitly for at least some non-
white-noise eﬀects. For example, in the calculation of
the triad interaction time θkpq = 1/(ηk + ηp + ηq) for
three-wave interactions, ﬁnite values of the assumed noise
decorrelation rate ηp + ηq are used.]

Nevertheless, there is still no reason in a general sit-
uation that the two-time correlation function and the
Green’s function be constrained to be proportional to
each other. As described elsewhere, there may be regimes
where the resulting diﬀerences between the decorrelation
rate and the decay rate are signiﬁcant.

The outline of this paper is as follows.

Sec. (II)
presents some of the essential ideas of this paper for a
very simple Langevin equation, and includes a section
motivating the choice of the limit operator introduced by
BKO1 to ensure realizability. Sec. (III) presents a more
detailed calculation of the non-white Markovian model
for a simple Langevin equation, including the eﬀects of
complex damping rates (to represent the wave frequency)
and the issue of Galilean invariance. The model is com-
pared with exact results in the steady-state limit, and
then an extension to time-dependent Langevin statistics
is presented (along with, in Appendix A, an alternative
proof of realizability for this case). Sec. (IV) presents the
notation of the full many-mode nonlinear equations we
will solve and summarizes the direct interaction approxi-
mation (DIA), which is our starting point. Sec. (V) sum-
marizes how the non-white Markovian approach is de-
rived for the steady-state limit (with further details given
in Appendix B), while Sec. (VI) presents the full non-
white Markovian approximation for the time-dependent
DIA. Sec. (VII) discusses some important properties of
these equations, including the limits of thermal equilib-
rium and inertial range scaling, and some diﬃculties due
to the lack of random Galilean invariance in the DIA and
described in Appendix C. The conclusions include some
suggestions for future research.

II. SIMPLE EXAMPLES BASED ON THE
LANGEVIN EQUATION

Here we expand upon the analogy given in Sec. (I) us-
ing a simple Langevin equation, which provides a useful
paradigm for understanding the essential ideas consid-
ered in this paper. Since realizable Markovian closure

3

approximations to the DIA can be shown to correspond
exactly to an underlying set of coupled Langevin equa-
tions, the analogy is quite relevant. In this section we
will consider heuristic arguments based on some simple
scalings; later sections will be more rigorous.
Consider the simple Langevin equation

sistency with the form of the equations used later for a
generic quadratically nonlinear equation.] The statistics
of the noise are given by a speciﬁed two-time correla-

limit, Cf (t, t′) = 2Dδ(t
t′), and the power spectrum of
−
the Fourier-transform of f (t) is independent of frequency,
and is thus called a “white” spectrum.] The Langevin
equation is used to model many kinds of systems exhibit-
ing random-walk or Brownian motion features. Here we
can think of ψ as the complex amplitude of one compo-
nent of the turbulence with a speciﬁed Fourier wave num-
ber k. Note that η may be complex (representing both
damping and wave-like motions) and represents both lin-
ear and nonlinear (renormalized) damping or frequency
shifts due to interactions with other modes. The random
forcing f ∗ represents nonlinear driving by other modes
beating together to drive this mode.

the decorrelation rate for ψ is just η. This is equivalent
to the assumption in a broad class of Markovian models
that the decorrelation rate for ψ is the same as the decay
rate of the response function.

However, consider the opposite of the white-noise limit,
where f varies slowly in time compared to the 1/η time
scale. Then the solution of Eq. (2) is approximately
ψ(t) = f ∗(t)/η, and the decorrelation rate for ψ will
be the same as the decorrelation rate for f ∗.
In this

limit, the assumption in many Markovian models that
the decorrelation rate is η is not valid.

Denote the decorrelation rate for f ∗ as η∗

f , and the
decorrelation rate for ψ as ηC . Then one might guess
that a simple Pad´e-type formula that roughly interpo-
η and the op-
lates between the white-noise limit ηf ≫

In fact, we will discover in the next section that more
detailed calculations give similar results in the limit of
real η and ηf , though the formulas are more complicated
in the presence of wave behavior with complex η and ηf .
We note that in many cases of interest, the noise decor-
relation rate ηf turns out to be of comparable magnitude
to η (for example, if the dominant interactions involve
modes of comparable scale). In this case, while the white-
noise approximation is not rigorously valid, the correc-
tions to the decorrelation rate considered in this paper
might turn out to be quantitatively modest,
50%. Fur-
thermore, in the case of the full DIA and its correspond-
ing generalized Langevin equation, we will ﬁnd additional
corrections that can, in some cases, oﬀset the eﬀects in
Eq. (4) and cause ηC to be closer to η.

Before going on to the more detailed results in the next
section, we consider the meaning of an operator intro-
duced in the BKO1 derivations in order to preserve real-
izability in the time-dependent case, where η(t) varies in
time and may be negative (transiently), representing an
instability. [In order for a meaningful long-time steady-
state limit to exist, the net η (which is the sum of lin-
ear and nonlinear terms) must eventually go positive to
provide a sink for the noise term. But it is important
to preserve realizability during the transient times when
η may be negative.] Based on arguments about symme-
try and the steady-state ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem,
they initially proposed a time-dependent ansatz of the
form

C(t, t′) = C1/2(t)C1/2(t′) exp

(for t > t′), where C(t)
= C(t, t) is the equal-time
covariance. Later in their derivation, they state that
in order to ensure realizability, η(¯t) in this expression
(η(¯t)), where the operator
had to be replaced with
(η) = Re ηH(Re η) + i Im η prevents the real part of

the eﬀective η in Eq. (5) from going negative.

Physically this makes sense for the following reasons.
Consider Eq. (2) with white noise f (thus ignoring the
non-white-noise eﬀects). Then in a normal statisti-
cal steady state where η(t) is constant and Re η > 0,
Eq. (5) properly reproduces the usual result C(t, t′) =
C0 exp(
). However, if Re η < 0 (which it might
|
do at least transiently in the full turbulent system con-
sidered later), then Eq. (2) can’t reach a steady state,

Thus C(t, t′) = C1/2(t)C1/2(t′) exp(

agreement with and providing an additional intuitive ar-
gument for BKO’s modiﬁed form of Eq. (5), including
the
(η) operator. [There may be an initial phase where
the noise term f in Eq. (2) dominates and causes C(t)
to grow linearly in time, C(t) =
= 2Dt. But
eventually the unstable ηψ term will become large enough
to dominate and lead to exponential growth of ψ.]

The model we will introduce below replaces η in Eq. (5)
with a separate parameter ηC , and develops a formula to
relate ηC to other parameters in the problem such as
η and ηf . In the white-noise limit, the formula for ηC
automatically reproduces the eﬀects of the
limiting
operator, as will be described in the next section and
in Appendix (A). But numerical investigation of non-
white noise with wave dynamics (Im η

limiting operator is still
needed to ensure realizability. This will be explained at
the end of Sec. (III C).

We considered naming the method described in this
paper the Non-White Markovian Closure since, for the
simple Langevin equation considered here and in the next
section, the decorrelation rate and the decay rate are
equal only in the white-noise limit, and this approach al-
lows these rates to diﬀer.
[Alternatively, to emphasize
the ﬂexibility of this method one might have called it the
Colored-Noise Markovian Closure since instead of being
restricted to white-noise (a uniform spectrum) we can al-
low a noise spectrum of width δω
Re ηf peaked near
an arbitrary frequency ω
Im ηf . In other words, this
closure can model spectra with a range of possible col-
ors.] However, as we will discuss further, while a simple
Langevin equation is sometimes used to demonstrate re-
alizability of Markovian approximations, the DIA is actu-
ally based on a generalized Langevin equation involving
a non-local time-history integral (compare Eq. (2) with
Eq. (40)). Because non-white ﬂuctuations enter not only
by making the noise term non-white but also by aﬀecting
this time-history integral, it is possible for the decay-rate
and the decorrelation rate to be equal even in some cases
where the noise is not white (as indeed is the case in ther-
mal equilibrium where the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theo-
rem must hold but the noise is not necessarily white). We
thus favor the name Multiple-Rate Markovian Closure
(MRMC), to emphasize that the method developed here
is a generalization of the previous Realizable Markovian
Closure (RMC) to allow for multiple rates (i.e., separate
decay and decorrelation rates).

III. DETAILED DEMONSTRATION OF THE
MULTIPLE-RATE MARKOVIAN METHOD
WITH THE LANGEVIN EQUATION

In this section, we demonstrate the Multiple-Rate
Markovian approach starting with a simple Langevin

5

equation. The steps in the derivation are quite similar
to the steps that will be taken in the following sections
for the case of the more complete DIA for more compli-
cated nonlinear problems, and thus help build insight and
familiarity. In this section, we will be introducing vari-
ous approximations that may seem unnecessary for the
simple Langevin problem, which can be solved exactly
in many cases (for simple forms of the noise correlation
function). But these are the same approximations that
will be used later in deriving Markovian approximations
to the DIA, and so it is useful to be able to test their
accuracy in the Langevin case.

Our starting point is the Langevin Eq. (2), but we
allow η(t) to be a function of time, so that the solution
to Eq. (3) for the response function is

R(t, t′) = exp

(instead of the solution given immediately after Eq. (3),

In principle it is possible to calculate directly two-time
statistics like C(t, t′) =

practice it is often convenient to consider instead the dif-

is the analog of the DIA equations for the two-time corre-
lation function (compare with Eq. (39a) and Eqs. (41)),
but with an integral only over the noise and no nonlinear
modiﬁcation of the damping term.

We deﬁne the equal-time correlation function C(t) in
terms of the two-time correlation function C(t, t′) as

Eq. (2). Then it can be written as

In the case of ﬂuid or plasma turbulence where ψ rep-

resents the amplitude of a Fourier mode
and f ∗ represents the amplitude of two modes with wave

but Eq. (17) fails this test. This problem and its solu-
tion is described in the review paper by Krommes,29 who
shows it is related to other diﬀerences in various previous
Markovian closures. The problem can be traced to the
deﬁnition of Eq. (15), which doesn’t satisfy the invari-
ance for general forms of C(t, t′). For example, we could
have multiplied the integrand in Eq. (15) by an arbitrary

This corresponds to ﬁtting Cmod(t, t′) to C(t, t′) by re-
quiring that both eﬀectively have the same projection
onto the function Cmod(t, t′). [As Krommes29 points out,
using the invariant deﬁnition Eq. (19) instead of Eq. (15)
is a non-trivial point needed to ensure realizability and
avoid spurious nonphysical solutions in some cases.]

If we consider the limit where η, ηf , and thus ηC are all
real, this simpliﬁes to the form

ηC =

ηηf
η + ηf + ηC

.

(22)

This is similar to (but more accurate than) the rough in-
terpolation formula Eq. (4) suggested in the introduction.
This kind of recursive deﬁnition, with ηC appearing on
both sides, is a common feature of the steady-state limit
of theories based on the renormalized DIA equations, and
can be solved in practice by iteration, or by considering
the time-dependent versions of the theories. In Eq. (22)
with real coeﬃcients, one can easily solve this equation
for ηC , but the solution is much more diﬃcult in the case
of complex coeﬃcients in Eq. (21). The resulting calcula-
tion is laborious, so we used the symbolic algebra pack-
age Maple30 to solve for ηC with complex coeﬃcients.
Looking at the real and imaginary parts of Eq. (21) sep-
arately eventually leads to a quadratic equation and a lin-
ear equation to determine the real and imaginary parts
of ηC . Unfortunately it takes 16 lines of code to write
down the resulting closed-form solution (though perhaps
there are common subexpressions that would simplify it).
(Maple worksheets that show this calculation and check
other main results in this paper are available online.31)
This is tedious for humans but easy to evaluate in For-
tran, C, or other computer language. On the other hand,
this is only helpful for the simple Langevin problem any-
way since direct solution is not really practical for the
full nonlinear problem considered by the DIA, where the
noise term of the Langevin equation is replaced by a sum

7

over many modes. In many cases of interest, the noise
decorrelation rate ηf turns out to be comparable in mag-
nitude to η, so iteration of Eq. (21) usually converges
quickly.
(However, there are limits where convergence
is slow, such as some strongly non-resonant cases where
Re η is very close to Re ηf and both are very small com-
pared to Im(ηf + η).) The other option is to consider
the time-dependent problem, the topic of the subsection
after next, which eﬀectively performs an iteration in time
as a steady state is approached.

pared to resonant interactions in realistic many-mode

ier to model with disparate values of Re ηf and Re η, as
shown in Fig. (6) and Fig. (2), because interference eﬀects
are less important. To do better for the non-resonant case
Re η would probably require a more elab-
with Re ηf ∼
orate two-exponential model than Eq. (14), to allow for
the constructive and destructive interference eﬀects rep-
resented in Fig. (5). Of course, for the simple Langevin
case of this section, such a model could exactly repro-
duce Eq. (13), although for more complicated cases it
would again become a model to be ﬁt to the true C(t, t′)
dynamics. (Another approach, which might improve the

The results are shown in Figs. (1-6) for a variety

(Re(ηf )/ Re(η)) can matter. Thus we choose a frame

is reﬂected in the value of the noise frequency Im ηf .

Eq. (24) and Eq. (26) can be used to determine the
equal-time covariance C(t), but how can we determine
the decorrelation rate ηC from the two-time correlation
function C(t, t′)? [In the full nonlinear equations used
for the DIA, ψ for one mode appears in noise terms for
other modes, and so we would like to know the decorre-
lation rate as well as the amplitude C(t).] Even in the
steady-state limit of the previous section, we found that
the full two-time correlation function C(t, t′) had a more
complicated form than a simple exponential, and so we
ﬁt a simpler model Cmod(t, t′) to it in order to determine
an eﬀective decorrelation rate ηC .

We follow a similar procedure here. We again use
BKO’s form for a realizable time-dependent two-time cor-
relation function to provide a model of C(t, t′),

This is the time-dependent analog of Eq. (19). Rather

In a normal long-time statistical steady state, where η,

then one can show that the second and third terms on the

Consider the behavior of these equations in an unstable
case, with Re η =

coeﬃcients η, ηf and Cf are all constant in time, with
Re(ηf ) > 0. Then one can show that C(t) eventually

in Eq. (27).
it is
straightforward to show that realizability is ensured for
all time, not just in the long-time limit (see also Ap-
pendix (A)). These results might suggest that the
op-
erator in Eq. (33) is not needed, if its argument always
has a positive real part anyway. However, by numeri-
cally integrating Eqs. (24), (26), and (32-34), we have
found cases where this is not true and the

such as η = 1 and ηf = 0.25 + 16i.] Eqs. (24, 26) are an

C(t) for Langevin dynamics, which ensures that C(t) is
always positive. But according to Theorem 2 of BKO1
(and Appendix A of the present paper), Re ηC ≥

IV. FORMULATION OF THE FULL NONLINEAR
PROBLEM AND STATISTICAL CLOSURES

In this section we provide background on the general
form of the nonlinear problem we are considering and
on the general theory of statistical closures. In partic-
ular we will write down Kraichnan’s direct-interaction
approximation, which is the starting point of our calcula-
tion. This section borrows heavily from the BKO paper1
(including some of their wording), but is provided for
completeness to deﬁne our starting point.

A. The fundamental nonlinear stochastic process

Consider a quadratically nonlinear equation, written

in Fourier space, for some variable ψk:

Here the time-independent coeﬃcients of linear “damp-
ing” νk and mode-coupling Mkpq may be complex. Given
random initial conditions, we seek ensemble-averaged
(or, if the system is ergodic, time-averaged) moments of
ψk(t), taking for simplicity the mean value of ψk to be
zero.

Many important nonlinear problems can be repre-
sented in this form with a simple quadratic nonlinearity.
For example, the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equa-
tion for neutral ﬂuid turbulence can be written in this
form, where ψ represents the stream function such that
p2)/k2.
the velocity v = ˆz
Other examples include Charney’s barotropic vorticity
equation for planetary ﬂuid ﬂow, and a class of two-
dimensional plasma drift wave turbulence problems (such
as the Hasegawa–Mima equation or the Terry–Horton
equation). Some three-dimensional one-ﬁeld plasma tur-
bulence problems can also be written in this form since

the dominant ~E
~B nonlinearity acts only in two dimen-
sions perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The three-
dimensional Navier–Stokes equations and general multi-
ﬁeld plasma turbulence equations can also be written in
the form of Eq. (35) if ψk is considered as a vector and
νk and Mkpq become matrices or tensors. In fact, BKO1
consider covariant multiple-ﬁeld formulations of the DIA
and Markovian closures. Here we will focus on the one-
ﬁeld case, where ψk is a scalar amplitude for mode k.

For each k in Eq. (35), the summation on the right-
hand-side involves a sum over all possible p and q that
satisfy the three-wave interaction k + p + q = 0 (this is
sometimes expressed as k = p + q, but the reality condi-
tions ψ−k = ψ∗
k has been used to rearrange it). Without
any loss of generality one may assume the symmetry

Mkpq = Mkqp.

(36)

Another important symmetry possessed by many such
systems is

[See Refs. 32 and 33 for the relation between this sym-
metry and the Manley-Rowe relations for wave actions.]
Equation (37) is easily shown to imply that the nonlin-
ear terms of Eq. (35) conserve the ensemble-averaged
.

total generalized energy E
[The
2
nonlinear terms also conserve the generalized energy in
each individual realization, although we will be focus-
ing on ensemble-averaged quantities, where
denotes
ensemble-averaging.] For some problems, Eq. (37) may
be satisﬁed by more than one choice of σk; this implies
the existence of more than one nonlinear invariant. For
example, in the case of two-dimensional hydrodynamics,
Eq. (37) is satisﬁed for both σk = k2 and σk = k4, which
correspond to the conservation of energy and enstrophy,
respectively.

approximation

useful to write the equal-time covariance equation in the
form

The starting point of our derivation will be the equa-
tions of Kraichnan’s direct-interaction approximation

below as Eqs. (39-41).

The original nonlinearity in Eq. (35) gives rise to two

The nonlinear damping and noise in Eqs. (39) are deter-
mined on the basis of fully nonlinear statistics.

These renormalized forms can be obtained from the for-

While there are inﬁnitely many ways of obtaining a renor-
malized expression, Kraichnan34 has shown that most of
the resulting closed systems of equations lead to phys-
ically unacceptable solutions. For example, they might
predict the physically impossible situation of a negative
value for Ck(t, t) (i.e., a negative energy)! Such behavior
cannot occur in the DIA or other realizable closures.

The DIA also conserves all of the same generalized en-

given initial conditions at the time t = t0 (unless other-

the symmetries (36) and (37) ensure that Eq. (42a)
conserves all quadratic nonlinear invariants of the form
E
k σkCk(t) in the dissipationless case where
Re νk = 0. The Markovian closures that BKO1 devel-
oped, and that we extend here, preserve the structure of
Eqs. (42) and so have all of the same quadratic nonlinear
conservation properties as the original equations.
[One
can show that Fk is always real, so the Re operation on
Fk in Eq. (42a) is redundant.]

(N 3

The DIA equations (39) and (41) provide a closed set
of equations, but are fairly complicated because they in-
volve convolutions over two-time functions. Their general
(N 2

numerical solution requires
O
operations in steady state. As described in BKO1 and
Krommes,3 a Markovian approximation seeks to simplify
this complexity by parameterizing the two-time functions
in terms of a single decorrelation rate. Our approach here
is essentially to generalize this to allow several rate pa-
rameters to be used, to allow the decorrelation rate for
Ck(t, t′) to diﬀer from the decay rate for Rk(t, t′).

V. RESPONSE FUNCTIONS IN A STATISTICAL
STEADY STATE

Markovian models provide approximations that can
simplify the integrals in Eqs. (39). For insight, we will
ﬁrst investigate the long-time limit where a statistical
steady-state should be reached, so that the two-time cor-
relation function C(t, t′) and response function R(t, t′)
t′. In a statisti-
can depend only on the time diﬀerence t
cal steady state, all of the Markovian models in BKO1 use
a simple exponential behavior for Ck(t, t′) and Rk(t, t′).
Here we will assume the model forms

Clearly this is not strictly consistent with the simple ex-
ponential form for Rk assumed in Eq. (43) and used to
evaluate the integrals in Eq. (39b). We will instead ﬁt the
model Eq. (43) to Eq. (47), in the same way that we did
in the Langevin case for Eq. (19). Requiring that both
Eq. (43) and the full Eq. (47) give the same weighted
average over time (where R∗
mod,k is used as the weight to
ensure invariance to frequency shifts) gives

Note that this has a similar form to the steady-state de-
cay rate in the DIA-based EDQNM, such as in Eq. (39b)
of BKO1 (but with their η∗

q replaced by η∗

Cq).

One can go through a similar calculation of Ck(t, t′),
and calculate its weighted time average to determine the
decorrelation rate ηCk. We will not do so now, as one
can instead just take the steady-state limit of the results
in the next section. Eq. (50) can also be obtained from
the steady-state limit of the results in the next section,
and so provides a useful cross-check.

We note that there is some ﬂexibility in the choice of
mod,k(t, t′) as the
weighting in Eq. (48). We could use C∗
weight instead of R∗
mod,k(t, t′). Either choice preserves
Galilean invariance. Using this alternate weight, Eq. (48)
becomes

and the resulting expression for ηk is like Eq. (50) but
with η∗
k on the right-hand side of Eq. (50) replaced by
η∗
Ck, which would automatically agree with the steady-
state ¯ηk to be deﬁned in Eq. (71). But it turns out that
the main steady-state results of Sec. (VII) hold with ei-
ther choice of weights, and it seems more symmetric and
makes more sense as a standard ﬁtting procedure to use
R∗
mod,k as the weight for integrating Rk in Eq. (48). This
raises the question of whether to use C∗
mod,k as
the weight function for time averages of Ck(t, t′), as we
will do in the next section. We can resolve this ambiguity
by going back to the steady-state Langevin problem of
Sec. (III A). If one tries to use R∗(t, t′) as the weight in
Eq. (19), so that it becomes

then one can go through the same steps used to derive
Eq. (22) and ﬁnd that in the limit of real coeﬃcients
it gives ηC = ηηf /(2η + ηf ).
In the red-noise limit
η, this gives ηC = ηf /2, which is a factor of 2
ηf ≪
oﬀ from the correct result (ηC = ηf ) for the red noise
mod,k(t, t′) as the weight for
limit. Thus, we will use C∗
taking time-averages of Ck(t, t′) and use R∗
mod,k(t, t′) for
time-averaging Rk(t, t′). The weighting choices might be
reconsidered in a multi-ﬁeld generalization of a Marko-
vian closure, where the requirement of covariance may
impose constraints on the choice of the weight functions,
but it seems that the symmetric choices made here are
most likely to generalize well.

This is very similar to the Bowman–Krommes–Otta-
viani Realizable Markovian Closure (RMC) (as given by
Eqs. (66a–e) of BKO1), but with the replacement of the
single decay/decorrelation rate of the RMC with three
diﬀerent rates in these equations.
[Other Markovian
models, such as the EDQNM closure, also use a single
decorrelation rate parameter.] If in Eq. (55d) we replace
ηk = ¯ηk, ηCp =
(¯ηq), then these
(¯ηp), and ηCq =
P
equations become identical to the RMC.

P

To summarize the three diﬀerent rates used here:

•

¯ηk is the nonlinear energy damping rate for the
wave energy equation for the equal-time covariance
Ck(t) in Eq. (55a), and is deﬁned in Eq. (55b);

•

ηk is the decay rate for the inﬁnitesimal response
function Rk(t, t′) in Eq. (54), and is deﬁned in
Eq. (61);

and ηCk is the decorrelation rate for Ck(t, t′) in
Eq. (53), and is deﬁned in Eq. (69).

•

To determine ηk(t) and ηCk(t), we follow a similar
procedure as we did for the time-dependent Langevin
equation in Sec. (III C). Deﬁne Ak(t) as the following
weighted time-average of Rk

where Eq. (55a) could be used to eliminate ∂Ck(t)/∂t. As
in Eq. (33) for the case of the time-dependent Langevin

go negative (as it does in two-dimensional hydrodynam-
ics because of the inverse cascade, or in some plasma
problems where the zonal ﬂows may become nonlinearly
unstable27,15,23). This is similar to BKO’s treatment.1

The complete set of equations that constitutes the
Multiple-Rate Markovian Closure (MRMC) are Eqs. (55)
for the equal-time covariance Ck(t) and related quan-
tities, Eqs. (57,60,61) for quantities related to the re-
sponse function, and Eqs. (63,67-69) for quantities re-
lated to the two-time correlation function. The MRMC
extends the RMC to make less restrictive assumptions
and include additional eﬀects, but at the expense of a
few new parameters.
In addition to replacing the sin-
gle decay/decorrelation rate of the RMC with 3 diﬀerent
rates, ηk, ¯ηk, and ηCk, it also replaces the single triad
interaction time of the RMC with 4 diﬀerent triad inter-
action times, Θkpq, Θ1,kpq, Θ2,kpq, and Θ3,kpq. Each
of these triad interaction times has a diﬀerent weighting
of response functions and two-time correlation functions.

Thus the decorrelation rate ηCk equals the response func-
tion decay rate ηk plus the two correction terms in brack-
ets. For the simple steady-state non-wave case with real

15

and positive η’s, the second correction term will cause
ηCk to decrease (as expected for non-white noise), while
the ﬁrst term will usually have an oﬀsetting opposite sign
and cause ηCk to increase. The origin of these two terms
can be traced back to the DIA Eq. (39a). The second
correction term corresponds to the usual eﬀects of non-
k(t, ¯t) in
white noise (related to the integral involving
Eq. (39a)), but the ﬁrst correction term in Eq. (72) is
related to the time-history integral involving the renor-
malized propagator Σk(t, ¯t) in Eq. (39a). Thus non-white
ﬂuctuations in other modes Cq(t, ¯t) not only change the
noise term for the k mode, but also change the eﬀec-
tive damping from the time-history integral, broaden-
ing the width of Σk(t, ¯t) in time (if the ﬂuctuations Cq
were treated as white noise, then Eq. (41a) would give
Σk(t, ¯t)

¯t)).

An important property to demonstrate is that in ther-
mal equilibrium it is possible for these two terms to can-
cel exactly. Then the decorrelation rate and response
function decay rate are equivalent, ηCk = ηk, and the
ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem is satisﬁed. To demon-
strate that this is true, we assume the result (ηCk = ηk)
to simplify some of the equations and then show that this
is a self-consistent assumption. (Note also that if ηCk =
ηk, then ¯ηk = ηk also.) Splitting the ﬁrst summation in
brackets in Eq. (72) into two equal parts and interchang-
ing the p and q labels for one of these parts (i.e., using
an identity of the form ΣGkpq = ΣGkpq/2 + ΣGkqp/2),
the terms in brackets in Eq. (72) can be written as

In thermal equilibrium, the spectrum Ck is given by
equipartition among modes of a generalized energy-like
conserved quantity. Consider an equipartition spectrum
k , the σ(i)
of the form Ck = 1/λk, where λk =
are the coeﬃcients in Eq. (37) (related to the quadratic
invariants), and α(i) are determined by the initial con-
ditions.
Substituting Ck = 1/λk, Cp = 1/λp, and
Cq = 1/λq into Eq. (73), and using Eqs. (36-37), one
can show that Eq. (73) indeed vanishes, so that Eq. (72)
simpliﬁes to ηCk = ηk. The proof that Ck = 1/λk is a
solution of the steady-state Eq. (71) proceeds in a simi-
lar way, interchanging the p and q labels for half of the
summation on the left-hand side of Eq. (71), and not-
ing that Re νk = 0 in an isolated thermal system, etc.
Rigorously, this only shows that the equipartition spec-
trum Ck = 1/λk is an equilibrium solution. This paper
doesn’t demonstrate that it is a stable equilibrium or
that mixing dynamics will necessarily relax to this state.
For a discussion of the Gibbs-type H theorem that leads
to this result, see Appendix H of Ref. 35 and Refs. 36
and 37. It is signiﬁcant to note that the thermal equilib-
rium result holds even if the number of modes is small,
and it does not assume that the noise spectrum is white.

This is unlike a simple Langevin equation of the form
of Eq. (2) (which has a local damping term in contrast
to the time-history integral of Eq. (40)), where the two-
time correlation function and the inﬁnitesimal response
function are proportional only if the noise is white.

We next estimate the importance of the correction
terms in the decorrelation rate for an inertial range of
a turbulent steady state, such as in two-dimensional hy-
drodynamics. Typically most of the energy is at long
wavelengths (Cq is peaked at suﬃciently low q), so that
the dominant contributions to the sums in Eq. (72) come

(ηCk + ηk) (since ηk and ηCk are typ-

ically increasing functions of k). Similar approximations

give (¯ηk

steady-state relation Fk = Re ¯ηkCk from Eq. (71) and
the disparate scale approximations to rewrite the second
sum in Eq. (72) in terms of ¯ηk, and allowing ﬁnite dissi-
pation but ignoring wave dynamics (so that νk and the
various η coeﬃcients are real), one can show that Eq. (72)
simpliﬁes in this disparate scale limit to

This gives a cubic equation for ηCk. For νk = 0 the roots

is that ηCk = ηk will be the usual case in a steady-
state inertial range.
(This appears reasonable, but it
might require numerical simulations to test it more deﬁni-
tively.) The other roots are probably unstable equilibria,
so that any perturbation away from it would eventually
approach the stable root, or may only be relevant in tran-
sient inverse-cascade cases where Re ηk < 0 (Re ηCk
0
being required to satisfy realizability).

≥

Thus the two correction terms in Eq. (72) again exactly
cancel each other (assuming the root choice made above),
leading to ηCk = ηk and the result that non-white-noise
corrections are asymptotically unimportant in a wide in-
ertial range (k large compared to the long-wavelength
energy-containing wave number scale k0). However, this
may be an artifact of the problem that the underlying
DIA, on which the MRMC is based, does not satisfy ran-
dom Galilean invariance. As is well known38,39,8,9,40,
the reason the DIA predicts a slightly diﬀerent spec-

The underlying reason for this failure of the DIA is
that the nonlinear damping and noise terms (the left- and
right-hand sides of Eq. (71)) are dominated by contribu-
tions from the energy at long wavelengths. A random-
Galilean invariant theory should depend only on the
shear of longer wavelength modes (as ηk does in Orszag’s
phenomenological EQDNM) and the most energetically
signiﬁcant interactions should occur among comparable
q
scales (
). Then the disparate scale ap-
|
|
proximations that led to Eq. (74) would no longer be
valid. In such a case, it would seem unlikely that the two
terms in Eq. (72) would still exactly cancel, and there
would probably be some diﬀerence between the decorre-
lation rate ηCk and the decay rate ηk. It would therefore
be interesting to try to apply the techniques developed
here (for allowing multiple rates) to other starting equa-
tions that respect random Galilean invariance, such as
the Lagrangian-history DIA, test-ﬁeld model, or renor-
malization group methods.

k

A regime where the correction terms might not can-
cel each other, and the diﬀerences between ηCk and ηk
might be signiﬁcant, even with the DIA’s overemphasis
of long-wavelength contributions to the eddy turnover
rate, is in ITG/drift-wave plasma turbulence, where the
spectrum can often be anisotropic and have strong wave
eﬀects. That is, νk can be complex, with unstable modes
in some directions and damped modes in others, so that
νk and Ck vary strongly with the direction of k. Some
plasma cases have a reduced range of relevant nonlin-
early interacting scales, and the simpliﬁcations of dis-
parate scales in an inertial range used to derive Eq. (74)
are not appropriate. The corrections might also be im-
portant in non-steady-state transient cases (such as zonal
ﬂows with predator–prey dynamics) or in other regimes
where interactions between comparable scales dominate.
Evaluating the diﬀerence between the decorrelation rate
ηCk and the decay rate ηk in more general cases such as
these probably requires a numerical treatment.

Finally, it is useful to demonstrate that the Multiple-
Rate Markovian Closure approximation preserves realiz-
ability, which turns out to require one additional con-
straint. The MRMC equations (55) have the underlying
Langevin equation

of BKO1 (and as can be inferred from considering the
statistics of f (t) = g(t)h(t), where g and h are sta-
tistically independent), a product of realizable correla-
tion functions is also a realizable correlation function.
Cmod,p(t, t′) and Cmod,q(t, t′) are individually realizable
because Re ηCk > 0 for all k. So in order to guarantee
realizability of Cf (t, ¯t), we need to impose the additional
condition that Re ηk

physically reasonable. The parameter ηk measures the

phase) is transferred out of mode k into other modes,
so it would seem reasonable that ¯ηk

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have demonstrated a method for ex-
tending Markovian approximations of the DIA, to allow
the decorrelation rate for ﬂuctuations to diﬀer from the
decay rate for the inﬁnitesimal response function (the
renormalized Green’s function or nonlinear propagator).
This can give a more accurate treatment of various ef-
fects such as non-white-noise forcing terms. In practice,
the corrections to the decorrelation rate are modest, at
least in isotropic non-wave cases, since the decorrelation
rate of the noise is usually comparable to, if not much
larger than, the decay rate for the response function.
For example, if ηf = η in the simple Langevin example
of Eq. (22), then the decorrelation rate is
60% lower
than its white-noise value. Furthermore, the Multiple-
Rate Markovian Closure Eq. (72) for the full DIA con-
tains an oﬀsetting term that can increase ηCk, so the net
result is less clear. This is because the DIA is related
to a generalized Langevin equation Eq. (40), where non-
white ﬂuctuations modify not only the noise term (which
tends to reduce the decorrelation rate) but also modify
the renormalized propagator in the time-history integral
(which tends to increase the decorrelation rate).

≈

We have demonstrated that these two terms in fact ex-
actly cancel each other as they should in thermal equilib-
rium where the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem applies.
We have also found another case, that of a wide inertial
range with no waves, where it is possible for these two

17

corrections to oﬀset each other exactly, so that the decor-
relation rate and the decay rates become equal. How-
ever, this may be an artifact of the loss of Galilean in-
variance in the Eulerian DIA, where modes in the iner-
tial range nonlinearly interact predominantly with long
wavelength modes. Thus it would be interesting to try
to apply the techniques developed in this paper to other
renormalized statistical theories, in which the dominant
nonlinear interactions in an inertial range are between
comparable scales instead of disparate scales and which
k−5/3 inertial-
properly reproduce Kolmogorov’s E(k)
range energy spectrum instead of the Eulerian DIA’s
k−3/2. Single-rate Markovian approximations
E(k)
have been applied in the past to other renormalized sta-
tistical theories10 and white-noise assumptions have also
been employed in renormalization group calculations of
turbulence.10 An interesting question is whether there is
some way to generalize such calculations to allow for mul-
tiple rates and non-white noise as considered here. An-
other question is whether multiple-rate extensions might
modify subgrid turbulence models.
[Such corrections
would probably be important only at short scales near
the transition from resolved to unresolved scales.]

∝

∝

Even in the context of an Eulerian DIA-based theory,
there may be some regimes where the multiple-rate cor-
rections in this paper may be important and warrant
further investigation. These might include cases where
non-steady-state dynamics are important (i.e., predator–
prey oscillations between diﬀerent parts of the spectrum,
such as between drift waves and zonal ﬂows), or where
interactions between comparable
scales are more im-
portant, such as might occur in anisotropic plasma tur-
bulence with wave dynamics and with instability growth
rates or Landau damping rates that vary strongly with
the magnitude and direction of the wavenumber. One
could test whether these corrections are important or
negligible in various regimes by looking at 3-mode cou-
pling cases,1,2 or by numerically comparing with the DIA
or direct numerical simulations.

The complete set of equations that constitutes the
Multiple-Rate Markovian Closure (MRMC) are summa-
rized in the ﬁnal paragraph of Sec. (VI). The MRMC ex-
tends the Realizable Markovian Closure (RMC) of BKO1
to allow various nonlinear rates and interaction times to
diﬀer. The single decay/decorrelation rate of the RMC is
replaced with 3 diﬀerent rates, ηk (the response function
decay rate), ηCk (the decorrelation rate for the two-time
correlation function), and ¯ηk (the energy damping rate).
The triad interaction time of the RMC is replaced with 4
diﬀerent triad interaction times with various weightings
of decorrelation and decay rates. While this increases the
complexity of the equations somewhat, the main compu-
tational advantages of a local-in-time Markovian closure
relative to the non-local-in-time DIA are retained.

APPENDIX A: REALIZABILITY OF A
PARTICULAR TWO-POINT CORRELATION
FUNCTION

In theorem 2 of their Appendix B, Bowman, Krommes,
and Ottaviani1 show one way to prove that a two-point
correlation function of the form of Eq. (27) is “realiz-
able” (if Re ηC (t) > 0 is satisﬁed almost everywhere).
Realizability means that this two-point correlation func-
tion is the exact solution to some underlying stochastic
problem, such as a Langevin equation. In the absence of
realizability, non-physical diﬃculties can sometimes de-
velop, such as the predicted energy C(t) = C(t, t) going
negative or diverging. Here we present an alternate proof
that Eq. (27) is realizable.

Consider the standard Langevin equation with time-
dependent coeﬃcients, but in the white-noise limit
t′). Then Eq. (9) simpliﬁes

Eq. (8), becomes just ∂C(t, t′)/∂t + η(t)C(t, t′) = 0 for
t > t′, with the boundary condition C(t′, t′) = C(t′).
Taking the time derivative of Eq. (27) gives

APPENDIX B: FITTING MODELS TO THE
TWO-TIME CORRELATION FUNCTION

Conceptually the process of ﬁtting an exponential
model of decorrelation to the actual two-time correla-
tion function seems straightforward. But as described
in Sec. (III A) and Sec. (V), there are various choices
one could make in the weights used to ﬁt the models.
Galilean invariance imposes some constraints, but does
not completely constrain the problem. In this appendix
we further describe some options and our choices.

Consider the following measure of the error between
the actual two-time correlation function and a model cor-
relation function:

We will assume Cmod(t,′ t) is of the form of Eq. (27). The
equal time correlation function C(t) = C(t, t) is already
speciﬁed, so our task is to choose ηC (t) in Eq. (27) in such
a way as to minimize the squared error S. We want to
stay in a Markovian framework, where ηC (t) depends on

parameters only from the present time. We assume that
ηC (t′) for times t′ < t has already been chosen optimally.
But we can choose ηC (t) at the present time so that the
extrapolation of S(t) into the future is minimized. That
is, we want to minimize ∂S/∂t, which, after using Eq. (8)
for ∂C(t, t′)/∂t and Eq. (27) to evaluate ∂Cmod(t, t′)/∂t,
is

[Note that when evaluating derivatives of Eq. (B2) with
respect to ηCr and ηCi, it is only the explicit appear-
ance of ηC (t) in Eq. (B2) that is important. The pa-
rameter ηC (t) also appears implicitly via the deﬁnition
of Cmod(t, t′), but there it has an impact on the integral
deﬁning ∂S/∂t only through a set of measure zero, and
so can be neglected as long as ηC (t) is bounded.]

In the steady-state limit, Eq. (B3) is equivalent to
Eq. (19). For a time-dependent case, consider Eq. (B3)
as providing a constraint of the form Amod(t) = A(t).
Assuming that this has already been satisﬁed for earlier
times, we want it to remain satisﬁed for future times,
i.e., we need to require that ∂Amod/∂t = ∂A/∂t. This
is precisely what we are doing when we set Eq. (29) and
Eq. (30) to be equal, and it leads to a formula for ηC (t)
at the present time that minimizes the errors as time
advances.

The same procedures as described here are used in ﬁt-
ting a model response function Rmod(t, t′) of the form of
Eq. (54) to the actual response function, leading to the

As mentioned at the end of Sec. (V), R∗

However, Eq. (B4) seems to make more sense as a least-

have made.

It is perhaps not surprising that optimizing a constant
ηC to minimize the global error S0 gives a somewhat dif-
ferent result than optimizing ηC (t) to minimize the local
error ∂S/∂t. In order for the time-dependent ﬁtting pro-
cedures to reproduce this steady-state result, one could
modify Eq. (B1) by multiplying the integrand by a fac-
t′). Working through the derivation, one ﬁnds

by including an extra weighting of (t
priate places, Eq. (28), Eq. (48), Eq. (56), and Eq. (62),
and working through the derivations to see the modiﬁed
results. While such modiﬁcations could lead to an im-
proved model, and would be interesting for future work,
one should realize that the dynamics are complicated and
no choice of weights is perfect. For example, what one
really wants is a best ﬁt model for the triad interaction
times which are weighted by interactions between three
modes as given in Eq. (42d), not necessarily best ﬁts for
the decorrelation rates of just individual modes. Proba-
bly a higher priority for future work is to use a starting
set of equations that satisfy random Galilean invariance,
so that interactions with large scales are not overempha-
sized as they are in the Eulerian DIA.

The turbulence could be forced with a linear instabil-

Alternatively, one could adopt instead of Eq. (C4) the
stronger condition of statistical stationarity, Rk(t, t′) =

then readily seen to follow directly from Eq. (C3).
In
either case we have only shown that Eq. (C6) is a neces-
sary condition for self-similar solutions of the form (C1)
to exist.
In order that these solutions actually satisfy
Eq. (C3), it is also necessary at the very least that the
wavenumber integral in Eq. (C3) converges.

−

C

Unfortunately, the scaling expressed in Eq. (C6) of-
ten leads to a divergence of the q integral in Eq. (C3),
preventing self-similar solutions from existing. Typically,
the mode-coupling coeﬃcients Mk,−k−q,q asymptotically
approach a constant as q goes to zero while k is held ﬁxed.
Upon performing the p integration in Eq. (C3), we then
q (t, ¯t) for
see that the q integrand will scale like qd−1C∗
small q. If Cq asymptotically scales as qn, then the inte-
grand will scale like qd−1+n. But Eq. (C7b) implies that
2(m + s)/3. Normally m + s > 0 (see
d
Table I); in these cases there would be a divergence of
the q integral in Eq. (C3) if self-similar solutions really
were to exist.38,9

This divergence indicates that the dominant contribu-
tions to the eddy-turnover time come from the energy
spectrum at large scales, where self-similarity no longer
holds. (For this reason, the DIA is not invariant to ran-
dom Galilean transformations.) The actual value of the
scaling ℓ that appears in the DIA response must be cal-
culated by taking into account that Cq does not actually
behave as qn for small q. The DIA equations apply to the
case of zero mean ﬂow, where the energy spectrum goes to
zero at small wavenumbers. This means that the integra-
tion in Eq. (C3) must be eﬀectively cut oﬀ at some ﬁxed
large scale wavenumber k0. The introduction of this cut-
oﬀ wavenumber removes the divergence in the integral,
but it also changes the above scaling argument. Since the
dominant contribution to Eq. (C3) still comes from small
q, we need to identify the scaling of the mode-coupling

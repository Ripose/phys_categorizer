We present a simple viscous theory of free-surface ﬂows in boundary layers, which can accommodate
regions of separated ﬂow. In particular this yields the structure of stationary hydraulic jumps, both
in their circular and linear versions, as well as structures moving with a constant speed. Finally we
show how the fundamental hydraulic concepts of subcritical and supercritical ﬂow, originating from
inviscid theory, emerge at intermediate length scales in our model.

Despite the classical nature of the subject, the ﬂow
of a viscous ﬂuid with a free surface presents many un-
solved theoretical problems, even under laminar condi-
tions. To a large extent this is due to the lack of approx-
imate methods for describing ﬂows containing separated
regions, i.e. regions in which the ﬂow is reversed with re-
spect to the mean ﬂow. Hydraulic jumps are examples of
such ﬂows. They are large, sudden deformations in the
free surface of stationary ﬂows [1] and no theory exists for
their structure — save the full Navier-Stokes equations
combined with the free-surface boundary conditions, for
which even numerical solution poses large problems. In
this Letter we present a method for determining some
of these ﬂows, which includes viscosity and variations of
the velocity proﬁle. Stationary states are obtained as
trajectories in a simple two-dimensional phase space.

An inviscid theory of hydraulic jumps, which is still
the standard hydraulic approach to the subject, is due
to Lord Rayleigh in 1914 [2,3]. He regarded hydraulic
jumps as discontinuities (shocks) which can occur in the
shallow water equations [4]. Across a jump the ﬂow de-
celerates from a rapid supercritical ﬂow, in which distur-
bances propagate only down stream, to a subcritical ﬂow,
in which they propagate in both directions.

The circular hydraulic jump is easy to study experi-
mentally and to maintain in a laminar state. Here a jet
of ﬂuid falls vertically onto a horizontal surface (Fig. 1).
The ﬂuid spreads in an axisymmetric way, and a hy-
draulic jump is formed at some rj . The value of rj cannot
be found by the standard theory, and it depends strongly
on viscosity ν [5]. Further, experiments show clearly that
a separation bubble, or a recirculating region, forms on the
bottom in conjunction with the jump [5–8].

Separation per se has been studied more intensely in
boundary layers close to solid bodies, e.g. airfoils, im-
mersed in a high Reynolds number ﬂow. This line of
research descends from Prandtl’s seminal work [9] in
which he introduced the boundary layer approximation
— a radical simpliﬁcation of the Navier-Stokes equations.
Prandtl’s equations are valid in a thin layer near solid

(no-slip) surfaces, where the ﬂuid motion is predomi-
nantly along the surface. But in general, they become
singular at separation points [10], where the assumption
of forward ﬂow breaks down. The boundary layer equa-
tions can be further simpliﬁed by using an averaging tech-
nique of von Karman and Pohlhausen [9], in which the
tangential velocity proﬁle is approximated as a low or-
der polynomium. This model is useful up to a separation
point, but solutions beyond the point tend to diverge and
are discarded. Such troubles can be cured by taking into
account the feed-back eﬀect from the boundary layer on
the external ﬂow. The “inverse method” [11] makes it
possible to calculate ﬂows with separation bubbles, and
analytical results have been obtained for the structure of
separation points at large Reynolds numbers [12].

It is natural to employ the boundary layer approxi-
mation to describe hydraulic jumps since the ﬂuid moves
nearly parallel to the bottom surface. To avoid the singu-
larities near a jump encountered in earlier work [6,5] we
use the Karman-Pohlhausen method. The standard hy-
drostatic approximation then provides the link between
pressure and layer thickness analogous to the feedback
mechanism in the inverse method used above [13].

For a stationary, radially symmetric ﬂow with a free

surface the boundary layer equations take the form

uur + wuz = −gh′ + νuzz

ur + u/r + wz = 0

(1)

(2)

where u(r, z) and w(r, z) are the radial (r) and ver-
tical (z) velocity components, h(r) is the height, and
we assume hydrostatic pressure. Surface tension has
been neglected, since it does not appear to be deci-
sive in determining the structure of the ﬂow, although
it is necessary for the stability of the ﬂows as dis-
cussed below. The boundary conditions are no-slip on
the bottom: u(r, 0) = w(r, 0) = 0, no stress on the
top: uz(r, h) = 0 (strictly valid only for small defor-
mations |h′|) and the kinematic boundary condition at

1

the top: w(r, h) = u(r, h)h′, which ensures the mass con-

servation: 2πr R
0 udz =const.= Q = 2πq. By rescal-
ing the horizontal and vertical lengths and velocities by
L = (q5ν−3g−1)1/8, H = (qνg−1)1/4, and V = (qνg3)1/8,
respectively, all parameters are eliminated from (1,2) [5].
We average these equations over z, but in contrast
to earlier approaches [6,5] we shall not assume a self-
similar velocity proﬁle.
Instead the velocity proﬁle is
parametrized as

u(r, z) = v(r) (cid:0)a1(r)η + a2(r)η2 + a3(r)η3

(cid:1)

Implementing the boundary con-
where η = z/h(r).
ditions reduces the parameters to just one: λ(r),
i.e.
a1 = λ + 3, a2 = −(5λ + 3)/2 and a3 = 4λ/3. Thus
the proﬁle is parabolic when λ = 0 and separation oc-
curs for λ = −3. With these assumptions the averaged
momentum equation (1) takes the form [13]

v(F2(λ)v)′ = −h′ − (λ + 3)v/h2

(4)

h

0 u2dz)/(hv2) = 6/5 − λ/15 + λ2/105
where F2(λ) = (R
and rhv = 1. To determine λ, one more equation
is needed, and this is (as in the standard Karman-
Pohlhausen approach [9]) taken to be (1) evaluated on
the bottom (z = 0), which gives

h′ = −(5λ + 3)v/h2.

(5)

When v = 1/(rh) is inserted into (4,5) we obtain a
non-autonomous ﬂow for the two-dimensional vector ﬁeld
(h, λ). The ﬂow has singularities only on the lines h = 0
and λ = 7/2. It is thus possible to obtain both separation
and parabolic proﬁles without crossing singularities.

We solve the system with two boundary conditions.
Since the velocity proﬁles are not measured, we impose
two surface points h1(r1) and h2(r2), read from a recent
measurement of Ellegaard et al. [8]. Iterative adjustment
of λ at one end converges to a solution which passes
through the two chosen points. Figure 2(a) shows com-
parison of the calculated height h(r) and the measure-
ments, for two diﬀerent h2 values. The surface proﬁles
near rj show fair agreements, considering the simplicity
of the model, but rj is oﬀ by around 15%. Figure 2(b)
shows the calculated λ(r). A separation zone (λ < −3)
occurs just behind the jump and its size increases as h2
is raised, just as observed. The streamlines and velocity
proﬁles are determined from λ, and this leads to a graph-
ical representation of the ﬂow as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The model captures the experimental feature that h(r)
inside the jump is little aﬀected by the change in h2.
The curves in Fig. 2(a) apparently follow a single curve
inside the jump, from which trajectories diverge when r
is increased. Backward integration from r2 automatically
settles down to this value of λ, which helps us since the
entrance velocity proﬁle need not be speciﬁed. Further
details of the phase space structure can be found in [13].

Another quantity measured in [8] is the surface velocity
U (r) = u(r, h(r)). Comparison is made in Fig. 3, which
shows quantitative agreement, although rj again comes
out smaller. There is no free parameter other than h1,2,
taken from the experiments.

One can apply these methods to time-dependent ﬂows.
Since the time-dependent circular jumps typically in-
volve breaking of the radial symmetry [8], we take, as
an example, the two-dimensional (Cartesian) ﬂow down
an inclined plane. There exists a large body of liter-
ature [14–17] on such ﬂows to which we shall be able
to compare. We non-dimensionalize in terms of the
parabolic laminar solution [17] with a constant height
h0, mean velocity v0, and ﬂux q0 related by q0 = h0v0 =
gh3
0 sin α/(3ν), where α is the bottom slope. The Reynold
number is R = v0h0/ν = q0/ν while the Froude number
is F = v2
0/(gh0 cos α) = R tan α/3. We obtain [13]

ht + (hv)x = 0

where x is the scaled downward distance along the plane.
We ﬁrst study stationary solutions to the equations.
Then, hv = 1 from (6), and (7,8) form an autonomous
two-dimensional system for (λ, h), that can be easily
studied on a phase portrait. (This is the Cartesian ver-
sion of (4,5).) There is a unique ﬁxed point h = 1 and
λ = 0, and thus one cannot ﬁnd stationary states con-
necting two diﬀerent states with constant (h, λ). (This
can, however, be done for traveling waves; see below.) On
the other hand an interesting solution [18] is represented
by the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point emerging from
h = 0 as shown in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst part of the trajectory
has hx nearly constant [19], i.e. h ≈ A(x − x0)/R and
λ ≈ −3/5 until it suddenly jumps up to the ﬁxed point
values. Inserting into (6,7), we get A = 2.4/F2(−3/5) ≈
1.93. We believe this represents ﬂows that are observed
behind sluice gates though we treat the ﬂow as laminar
[20]. The conventional hydraulic theory predicts [3] that
a jump occurs behind a gate when the bottom slope is
“mild” (i.e. α being less than a critical slope). Corre-
spondingly, the jump structure in Fig. 4 disappears as
R tan α = 3F is increased beyond A [13].

It is also possible to ﬁnd a traveling wave solution [16]
which connects two parabolic laminar solutions of height
h1 at x = −∞ and h2 at x = ∞ [21]. These two limits
thus carry diﬀerent ﬂuxes, such that the ﬂux is conserved
in the moving frame only. By choosing the characteristic
height appropriately, we may set h1h2 = 1 without loss
of generality. Then we deﬁne the moving frame by ξ =

2

x − ct, and look for a stationary solutions in ξ, which by
(6) must satisfy c = h2
1 + h1h2 + h2
2(> 3). There are two
ﬁxed points h = h1,2, both with λ = 0, and a heteroclinic
solution from h1 to h2(< h1) as ξ increases can be found
[13] iﬀ R tan α < 60h3
1 + 33). Such river-
bore like solutions are calculated and shown in Fig. 5 for
a ﬁxed h1 and α and varying R. Note that the velocity
proﬁle always remains near parabolic as λ departs only
slightly from zero, and that the width of the “shock” is
much larger than the thickness of the layer, unlike the
steady jump (Fig. 4).

Finally, we study the dispersion of small disturbances
in the time-dependent system. The spectrum of the
uniform state (h = v = 1, λ = 0) allows the dis-
tinction between super- and subcritical ﬂows, which is
fundamental to hydraulics but not obvious for viscous
ﬂows. Surface tension is necessary for the stability calcu-
lations. An additional term (+RW hxxx/3) thus appears
on the right hand sides of (7,8), where W = σ/(ρh0v2
0) =
0 sin2 α) is the Weber number.

Assuming that all disturbances vary like exp(ikx−iωt),
we obtain [13] two dispersion branches.
In the k → 0
limit they behave as ω+(k) ∼ 3k + ik2(5R/4 − cot α) +
O(k3) and ω−(k) ∼ −14k/25−12i/5R+O(k3). Thus, the
ω− branch moves backwards, and the ﬂow is, irrespective
of the Froude number, “subcritical”. From the imaginary
parts, both branches are stable for a small R, but the ω+
branch becomes unstable for R tan α > 4/5. This is in
qualitative agreement with other models, notably those
coming from perturbation expansions [15,16,22] and from
averaging [17]. The so-called “Shkadov model” [17] is
identical to our system (6,7) with a rigid parabolic proﬁle,
i.e. λ ≡ 0, and omitting (8).

For very large k the model shows unphysical behavior,
as one branch becomes unstable. A priori we have no
reason to expect our model to be well deﬁned at length
scales much smaller than the normalized height, since
our starting point is the boundary layer approximation.
High-frequency oscillations are expected not to penetrate
far into the ﬂuid, but our assumption of the hydrostatic
pressure still connects λ and h rigidly. We can remedy
this by modifying (8), such that λ depends on a spatial
average of h and hx over an interval of the order of a
fraction of h [23].
In this way, the limit k → ∞ now
corresponds to the Shkadov model [17] and is stable.

For intermediate k, the dispersion behavior is very in-
teresting. When R tan α > 20/11 ≈ 1.82, the group ve-
locity of both branches will have positive real parts, and
the ﬂow is “supercritical”. In terms of the Froude num-
ber, this inequality becomes F > 20/33 which is similar
to the classical criterion of F > 1 even though our the-
ory includes viscosity. For large R tan α, the subcritical
range of k is so small that this supercritical behavior
dominates. In Fig. 6, we show dispersion curves (the real
parts of ω±) for R = 25, α = 5 [deg], and W = 0.01. The
slope of the ω+ branch is always positive. On the other

hand, the slope of the ω− branch changes its sign. The
subcritical small-k region is small, and such long-wave
disturbances become hard to create. Note that the crite-
rion R tan α = 3F < A ≈ 1.93 for the existence of a sta-
tionary jump (Fig. 4) is almost equivalent to the demand
that the ﬁnal state h = 1 be subcritical (R tan α < 1.82).
On the other hand, the linearly increasing part before the
jump in Fig. 4 is expected to be supercritical, but the dis-
persion around the solution is hard to obtain due to its
ﬁnite extent and the non-uniform character. In contrast,
for the moving jumps in Fig. 5, super- or sub-criticality
must be determined with respect to the jump. It can be
shown [13] that the ﬂow is supercritical in front of the
jump and subcritical behind, as expected.

To conclude, we have presented a simple model of free-
surface ﬂows which can describe separation and the struc-
ture of the circular and linear hydraulic jumps.

[18] A similar ﬂow has been found in numerical solution of the

[19] This conforms with E. J. Watson, J. Fluid Mech., 20,

[20] It is presumably possible to replace the loss term in (6-8)

to model turbulent ﬂows, as e.g. in [4].

[21] It is also possible to study homoclinic orbits [16,17], but

there surface tension appears crucial.

[22] The model used in [16] has only one branch of dispersion
relation and thus no distinction between supercritical and
subcritical ﬂow.

Anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inertial
range scalings in turbulent convection

This paper provides a detailed study of turbulent statistics and scale-by-scale bud-
gets in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection. It aims at testing the applicability of
Kolmogorov (1941) and Bolgiano (1959) theories in the case of turbulent convection and
at improving the understanding of the underlying inertial range scalings, for which a
general agreement is still lacking. Particular emphasis is laid on anisotropic and inho-
mogeneous eﬀects, which are often observed in turbulent convection between two diﬀer-
entially heated plates. For this purpose, the SO(3) decomposition of structure functions
(Arad, L’vov & Procaccia 1999b) and a method of description of inhomogeneities pro-
posed by Danaila et al. (2001) are used to derive inhomogeneous and anisotropic gener-
alizations of Kolmogorov and Yaglom equations applying to Rayleigh-B´enard convection,
which can be extended easily to other types of anisotropic and/or inhomogeneous ﬂows.
The various contributions to these equations are computed in and oﬀ the central plane
of a convection cell using data produced by a Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulent
Boussinesq convection at Ra = 106 and P r = 1 with aspect ratio A = 5. The analy-
sis of the isotropic part of the Kolmogorov equation demonstrates that the shape of the
third-order velocity structure function is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by buoyancy forcing and
large-scale inhomogeneities, while the isotropic part of the mixed third-order structure
function
appearing in Yaglom equation exhibits a clear scaling exponent 1 in a
small range of scales. The magnitudes of the various low ℓ degree anisotropic components
of the equations are also estimated and are shown to be comparable to their isotropic
counterparts at moderate to large scales. The analysis of anisotropies notably reveals that
computing reduced structure functions (structure functions computed at ﬁxed depth for
correlation vectors r lying in speciﬁc planes only) in order to reveal scaling exponents
predicted by isotropic theories is misleading in the case of fully three-dimensional turbu-
lence in the bulk of a convection cell, since such quantities involve linear combinations
of diﬀerent ℓ components which are not negligible in the ﬂow. This observation also in-
dicates that using single points measurements together with the Taylor hypothesis in
the particular direction of a mean ﬂow to test the predictions of asymptotic dimensional
isotropic theories of turbulence or to calculate intermittency corrections to these theories
may lead to signiﬁcant biases for mildly anisotropic three-dimensional ﬂows. A qualitative
analysis is ﬁnally used to show that the inﬂuence of buoyancy forcing at scales smaller
than the Bolgiano scale is likely to remain important up to Ra = 109, thus preventing
Kolmogorov scalings from showing up in convective ﬂows at lower Rayleigh numbers.

1. Introduction

F. Rincon

The quest for inertial range scaling laws in turbulent convection has been very active
in recent years (e. g. Chill´a et al. (1993); Benzi et al. (1994); Calzavarini et al. (2002);
Verzicco & Camussi (2003); Ching et al. (2004)). Their determination is expected to give
some important insight into the thermal and mechanical processes at work in the ﬂow.
To this end, turbulent thermal convection is investigated in convection cells heated from
below using laboratory and numerical experiments, within the framework of the Boussi-
nesq approximation. Such a ﬂow exhibits two essential properties: it is both strongly
anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Anisotropy comes from gravity, while inhomogeneity re-
sults from the presence of top and bottom horizontal boundaries in convection cells. As
a consequence, inertial range scalings of convective turbulence, when they can ever be
observed, depend strongly on the vertical coordinate.

Accordingly, asymptotic theories of turbulence constructed under the assumptions of
homogeneity and isotropy may be partially irrelevant to understand the observed prop-
erties of turbulent convection. Neglecting intermittency eﬀects, the classical picture re-
garding scaling laws in this ﬂow is that Bolgiano-Obukhov turbulence (Bolgiano (1959);
Obukhov (1959), hereafter BO59 theory) should be present on correlation lengths r larger
than the so-called Bolgiano length. A dimensional estimate of this length (Chill´a et al.
1993) is given by

where d is the depth of the convective layer, N u is the Nusselt number, Ra is the Rayleigh
number and P r is the Prandtl number. Instead, homogeneous and isotropic Kolmogorov
turbulence (Kolmogorov (1941), hereafter K41 theory) should be observed for r < LB.
In the Bolgiano-Obukhov subrange, a dominant balance between buoyancy forcing (for
an unstably stratiﬁed layer) and the third-order structure function occurs, which modi-
ﬁes the turbulent energy cascade substantially in comparison to K41: while longitudinal
r1/3 are predicted asymptotically in the inertial
velocity increment scalings
r3/5 in the BO59 regime. As far as tempera-
range for K41, they should follow
i ∼
r1/3 results from K41 (passive scalar scalings),
ture increments are concerned,
r1/5 is expected from dimensional arguments in BO59 theory. These
while
diﬀerent regimes should in principle be detected through the measurements of structure
functions or spectra when turbulence is suﬃciently developed. However, clear evidences
of K41 or BO59 scalings are still lacking in both numerical and experimental convec-
tion, even at very high Rayleigh numbers. Mixed scalings, which are not compatible with
dimensional analysis, have sometimes been detected (e. g. K41 scalings for the veloc-
ity and BO59 scalings for temperature in the same wave number range, see for instance
Verzicco & Camussi (2003)). BO59 scalings have been reported in the bulk of experimen-
tal convection cells (Benzi et al. 1994; Ching et al. 2004), and in a numerical experiment
(Calzavarini, Toschi & Tripiccione 2002), close to the horizontal walls of the convection
cell. Direct scaling laws could not be observed for reduced structure functions (structure
functions computed at ﬁxed depth for correlation vectors r lying in horizontal planes
only) in the latter study, so that the derivation of scaling exponents by Calzavarini et al.
(2002) relies on Extended Self Similarity (ESS, see Benzi et al. (1993)). Results obtained
for various anisotropic ﬂows, such as the channel ﬂow (Arad et al. 1999a), demonstrate
that it is sometimes possible to observe scaling laws by plotting structure functions di-
rectly, even at modest Reynolds numbers, provided that the complete computation and
SO(3) decomposition of structure functions are performed: in the work of Arad et al.
(1999a), the diﬀerence between reduced structure functions and the isotropic (angular

mean) component of the complete structure functions is striking. This spherical harmon-
ics decomposition of structure functions has also been computed by Biferale et al. (2003)
for homogeneous Rayleigh-B´enard convection (HRB) in a regime where LB is compa-
rable to the box size, thus preventing any possibility of BO59 scalings. The anisotropic
scaling exponents reported for HRB are anomalous, which means that they do not match
dimensional analysis predictions either. The understanding of inertial range scalings in
convective turbulence and their very existence even at high Rayleigh numbers therefore
remains a puzzling problem that still deserves important eﬀorts.

This paper aims at presenting a complete description of turbulent statistics in Boussi-
nesq convection at Ra = 106 and P r = 1 in order to test explicitly the assumptions of
both K41 and BO59 theories in such a ﬂow and to try to clarify some of the previously
mentioned problems regarding the occurrence of inertial range scaling laws in convective
turbulence. The study shows that inhomogeneity, anisotropy and the presence of buoy-
ancy forcing at all scales all contribute to the absence of scaling laws, and points out
that very high Rayleigh numbers should be reached in order to be able to observe the
deﬁnite signature of spectral scalings in turbulent convection. The presentation of the
results is as follows. The SO(3) decomposition of statistical averages is ﬁrst used in
2
to derive generalized Kolmogorov and Yaglom equations including inhomogeneous and
anisotropic terms, which describe respectively the production, transport and dissipation
of velocity and temperature ﬂuctuations. A detailed numerical study of these equations
is then proposed using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. The DNS and data pro-

which leads to the well-known K41 scaling law in the inertial range of turbulence. To ob-
tain it, one also has to assume that the forcing mechanism of turbulence is important on
large scales only. There are however numerous ﬂows, such as Rayleigh-B´enard convection,
where some of these assumptions possibly break down. A detailed study of scale-by-scale
energy budgets in turbulent convection is therefore required to test explicitly the ac-
curacy of these assumptions. Indeed, the velocity budget will diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
equation (2.1) if one or several of these hypothesis are violated. The objective of this sec-
tion is to provide a derivation of generalized forms of Kolmogorov and Yaglom equations
including anisotropic and inhomogeneous eﬀects, in order to be able to perform com-
parisons with equation (2.1) and with the homogeneous and isotropic version of Yaglom
equation, for a given convective ﬂow. A procedure inspired by Monin & Yaglom (1975),
Lindborg (1996), Hill (1997), Antonia et al. (1997) and Hill (2002), is adopted here.
The method has already been applied to channel ﬂow turbulence (Danaila et al. 2001),
heated decaying turbulence (Danaila et al. 1999) and shear turbulence (Casciola et al.
2003), which, as Rayleigh-B´enard convection, are anisotropic (and sometimes inhomo-
geneous) ﬂows. Inhomogeneity is investigated in a similar fashion as in the paper by

4

F. Rincon

Danaila et al. (2001). The procedure is supplemented by a spherical harmonics decom-
position of structure functions (Arad et al. 1999b) which serves to quantify anisotropic
eﬀects. It should be noted that a study of structure function scalings in turbulent con-
vection is available (Yakhot 1992) and that it has been used by several authors (e. g.
Benzi, Toschi & Tripiccione (1998)) to predict scaling behaviour in numerical experi-
ments. However, this work assumes isotropy and homogeneity, which, as will be shown
later in the paper, are not appropriate for this ﬂow.

2.1. Derivation of the inhomogeneous Kolmogorov and Yaglom equations

Summation over repeated indices is assumed throughout the derivation. A Boussinesq
ﬂuid of constant density ρ, kinematic viscosity ν and thermal diﬀusivity κ is used. Gravity
is denoted by g =
gez, where z is the vertical coordinate. The Boussinesq equations
(Chandrasekhar 1961) for the velocity ﬁeld u, pressure ﬁeld p and temperature ﬁeld T
(separated into a mean part

As the Rayleigh-B´enard ﬂow is homogeneous in the horizontal directions, the X depen-
dence is restricted to Z, so that only ∂Z derivatives have to be considered. It is important
to outline that ∂Z is not the same operator as ∂z, since r is to be kept constant when the
former is applied, while z′ must be kept constant in the latter case. Assuming statistical
stationarity, equations (2.10)-(2.11) become

In the preceding equations, the √4π factor comes from the normalization with respect
to Y 0
0 . Equation (2.1) follows directly from integration of equation (2.15) by imposing
ℓ = m = 0 (isotropy) and suppressing the
terms (homogeneity). As noted by
several authors (e. g. Antonia et al. (1997)), there is a striking analogy between the
generalized Kolmogorov equation (2.15) which deals with the turbulent transport of
kinetic energy (∆ui)2 and equation (2.16), which involves the turbulent transport of
entropy ﬂuctuations, which are proportional to (∆θ)2 for a Boussinesq ﬂuid (L’vov 1991).
This analogy is perfect when temperature is a passive scalar, while for non-neutrally
stratiﬁed ﬂows, extra terms representing the coupling between temperature and velocity
ﬁelds appear.

Finally, it is worth recalling that

m stands for the projection of the scalar cor-

is closed in terms of correlation functions all belonging to the same (ℓ, m) order. This
is not the case because, as explained in detail by Biferale et al. (2003), gravity breaks
the spherical symmetry of the equations of motion, leading to a coupling between the ℓ
1), ℓ and (ℓ + 1) harmonic components
component of Kolmogorov equation and the (ℓ
of the cross correlator between temperature and velocity. Therefore, projecting

only provides a convenient way to analyse the net eﬀect of gravity on the cor-
responding ℓ component of the third-order structure function and does not mean that
foliation of the Rayleigh-B´enard equations with respect to ℓ (that is the question of the
very existence of distinct inertial scaling exponents for diﬀerent ℓ components of cor-
relators) is satisﬁed. Foliation remains an open question for both Rayleigh-B´enard and
Navier-Stokes equations (Biferale & Procaccia 2005).

2.3. Symmetries of the Boussinesq equations

Statistical averages in equations (2.15)-(2.16) obey some symmetry properties which will
be listed here before a detailed analysis is carried out. First, there is an azimuthal sym-
metry which is due to isotropy in horizontal planes, so that only the m = 0 components
need to be considered here. The other important symmetry is the top-down symmetry
of the Boussinesq equations. For z = 1/2, the following rules can be derived:

(a)

0 vanishes for odd ℓ,

(b) the even ℓ components of statistical averages containing odd powers of uz, like for
ℓ
0, vanish, while their Z-derivatives are nonzero,
(cid:11)

uz(∆ui)2
(cid:10)

(c) the Z-derivatives of the odd ℓ components of the same statistical averages vanish.

Consequently, only even ℓ have to be considered at the center of the cell. Except for the
azimuthal symmetry, the previous rules can not be applied to z
= 1/2, where the complete
ℓ spectrum has to be computed. An important consequence of the previous observations
is that inhomogeneous eﬀects should be present at the center of the convection cell, and

6

that the isotropic component should be aﬀected by these eﬀects. This also occurs for
the channel ﬂow, which obeys the same top-down symmetry (Danaila et al. 2001) as
Boussinesq convection.

The various terms in equations (2.15)-(2.16) have to be computed in order to shed some
Θ
light on the dominant contributions to the third-order structure functions
i
and to test quantitatively the assumptions of both BO59 and K41 theories for this ﬂow.
To this end, one can choose to resort to either laboratory or numerical experiments. As
will be discussed shortly, the main drawback of numerics is that only moderate Rayleigh
numbers can be achieved in comparison to laboratory experiments. However, many inter-
esting beneﬁts can be gained from using numerical simulations to study the properties of
equations (2.15)-(2.16). The most important ones are that complete two-points averages
can be computed easily without invoking the Taylor hypothesis and assuming isotropy,
and that every quantity such as p can be easily obtained from the simulation at various
locations. This motivated the choice of using numerics in the present study. A description
of the DNS and numerical procedures used in order to perform this numerical analysis
is now presented.

3.1. Code setup
To investigate equations (2.15)-(2.16), the Boussinesq equations (2.2)-(2.3) for velocity
and temperature are solved for Ra = 106, P r = 1 and an aspect ratio A = 5 with a DNS
code initiated by Califano (1996), designed for anisotropic ﬂows. It makes use of a sixth-
order compact ﬁnite diﬀerences scheme (Lele 1992) in the vertical z direction and of a
spectral scheme with 2/3 dealiasing in the horizontal ones. Time-stepping is implemented
via a third-order, fully explicit Runge-Kutta scheme (Demuren, Wilson & Carpenter
2001). A projection method is used to ensure that the velocity ﬁeld remains divergence-
free. This method involves a Poisson solver to compute the pressure ﬁeld. For the chosen
aspect ratio, 256 points are used in each horizontal direction and 128 points in the ver-
tical. A smaller mesh size is required in the vertical to resolve the thermal boundary
layers accurately. Fixed temperature and stress-free boundary conditions are imposed on
both plates, while periodic boundary conditions are used in the horizontal directions.
Note that these boundary conditions oﬀer a higher supercriticality (for a given Rayleigh
number) than rigid boundaries, so that this simulation at Ra = 106 is in all likelihood
located at the lower end (with respect to Ra) of the soft turbulence regime range of
convection (Heslot, Castaing & Libchaber 1987).

Distances are normalized with respect to d: z = 0 corresponds to the bottom plate and
z = 1 to the top one. The simulation starts from small random temperature perturba-
tions of the initial linear temperature proﬁle and lasts for approximately ﬁfty turnover
times of the ﬂuid, where one turnover time, deﬁned here as twice the time it would take
for a ﬂuid element with velocity equal to the r.m.s. vertical velocity in the central plane
to travel from one boundary to the other, corresponds to the time interval required before
two snapshots can be considered independent. After a short linear growth phase, an ener-
getically steady turbulent state is reached in approximately one turnover time. It should
be noted that plume clustering (Cattaneo et al. 2001; Hartlep et al. 2003; Parodi et al.
2004; Rincon et al. 2005) is observed in moderate and large aspect ratio simulations,
which can be identiﬁed with the mean wind observed in small aspect ratio convection
cells, as shown recently by van Reeuwijk et al. (2005). The slow evolution of the integral
scale towards large scales that results from this eﬀect does not aﬀect the results pre-

sented here, which concern structures on scales smaller than the layer depth, for which
an energetically steady state is reached quickly. In the statistically steady state, the Nus-
selt number computed from the data of the simulation is N u
14. The Bolgiano scale,
following equation (1.1), is LB = 0.11 (with respect to d), but as will be shown later, this
value does not correspond to the eﬀective Bolgiano scale at the center of the convection
cell. The Kolmogorov dissipation scale, η = 0.016, is adequately resolved with the chosen
mesh sizes. At the center of the convection cell, the Reynolds number based on the r.m.s.

3.2. Averaging procedure and statistical convergence

×

Statistical averages are computed for given horizontal planes z by measuring each re-
quired quantity once every turnover time and at every four points in each horizontal
direction. This procedure has notably been used by Arad et al. (1999a) for the channel
ﬂow and makes uses of homogeneity in both horizontal directions. At this stage, one
may wonder why only a moderately turbulent simulation with Ra = 106 is presented
here, whereas Verzicco & Camussi (2003) managed to simulate convective ﬂows up to
1011. It is worth emphasizing that the present work aims at computing various
Ra = 2
two-point statistical averages, and that such computations require a very long integration
of the equations and a large number of independent realisations of the ﬂow to be collected
in order to get a good convergence, especially for structure functions of odd order and
large ℓ components. This very large data and computing time requirement is the main
reason why all numerical studies that deal with the computation of statistical quantities
such as structure functions have to make an important compromise between resolution
and integration time and are therefore currently limited to moderate Rayleigh/Reynolds
numbers. For instance, Arad et al. (1999a) used 160 independent snapshots of their ﬂow
at Reλ = 70 to compute structure functions, while Casciola et al. (2003) simulated shear
ﬂow turbulence at Reλ = 45 during 5900 shearing times in order to perform their statis-
tical analysis. Calzavarini et al. (2002) and Biferale et al. (2003) stored respectively 400
and 270 independent conﬁgurations of aspect ratio one convective turbulence at Rayleigh
numbers of order 107. Such parameter values all lead to turbulent regimes comparable
to that of this simulation (in the case of Casciola et al. (2003), the largest value for r
is 55η, to be compared with 30η here). In the present study, convergence for all statis-
tical quantities at correlation lengths smaller than 0.5 starts to be satisfactory (up to
a few percents) after approximately ten turnover times, which is only possible because
one time snapshot of a simulation with aspect ratio A = 5 can be considered ideally as
25 independent snapshots of an aspect ratio one simulation for scales smaller than 0.5.
Therefore, convergence is in fact only obtained by collecting more than 200 independent
“aspect ratio one” snapshots, as in the previously mentioned studies. In comparison, the
high-resolution simulations by Verzicco & Camussi (2003) with aspect ratio A = 1/2 last
for at most 220 free-fall turnover times, which correspond to only 16 turnover times as
. This is far from suﬃcient to obtain convergence for all statistical quanti-

†
ties of interest and, unfortunately, performing such simulations for much longer times is
currently prohibitive from the computing time point of view.

† Snapshots separated by one free-fall turnover time in their study can not be considered
independent. The free-fall turnover time in their simulation is approximately 14 times smaller
than the turnover time based on the r.m.s. vertical velocity, since the latter is approximately
0.07 times the free-fall velocity (see their ﬁgure 14).

3.3. SO(3) decomposition

The spherical harmonics decomposition is computed in the following way: statistical
averages are computed for various correlation length vectors r making diﬀerent angles θ
with the vertical direction, located on a Gauss-Legendre grid containing 15 points. This
computation is performed for 20 diﬀerent values of the azimuthal angle ϕ. A Fourier
transform on ϕ and a Legendre transform on θ follow, which lead to the amplitudes of
the various (ℓ, m) components at a given r. The procedure is repeated at various distances
r to obtain the ﬁnal results. Interpolation between grid points is the only trick that one
has to resort to in order to compute anisotropic structure functions. It does not aﬀect the
results signiﬁcantly except for very small correlation lengths comparable to the mesh size.
The ∂Z and ∂2
Z derivatives in the inhomogeneous terms are calculated by diﬀerentiating
results obtained at diﬀerent z with fourth-order ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes.

4. Results

This section provides an exhaustive presentation of results obtained by computing the
various terms in equations (2.15)-(2.16) from DNS data. A preliminary analysis is ﬁrst
carried out in order to outline inhomogeneous eﬀects in the Rayleigh-B´enard system.

4.1. Inhomogeneity in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection

Figure 1 represents snapshots of temperature perturbations in the midlayer and close to
the surface in the statistically stationary state of the simulation. Obviously, temperature
maps at diﬀerent altitudes look very diﬀerent: while large scale temperature perturbations
dominate the convective pattern inside the cell, smaller scale structures separated by
dark lanes become prominent in the thermal boundary layer close to the surface. The
presence of these dark lanes also leads to a clear increase of small-scale power in the
temperature spectra computed close the plates (Rincon et al. 2005). This depth-variation
of the properties of convective turbulence has been known for a long time. It is even
more striking in non-Boussinesq compressible convection, where the top-down symmetry
is lost (e. g. Toomre et al. (1990); Cattaneo et al. (1991)). Inhomogeneity in the system
is further illustrated in ﬁgure 2, which shows horizontal velocity spectra computed at

z = 0.25 (
Due to the top-down symmetry of Boussinesq convection, only spectra in the lower half of the
layer are presented. BO59 and K41 slopes have been overplotted to illustrate the diﬃculty to
identify a deﬁnite spectral slope. Wave numbers have been normalized with respect to 2π/(dA),

where Ωk stands for the wave vectors angles in the horizontal spectral plane, and the
hat denotes horizontal Fourier transforms. Measuring deﬁnite slopes on these spectra
proves all the more diﬃcult than their shape depend quite strongly on the depth at
which the computation is carried out. As will be demonstrated in the next paragraphs,
there are various reasons for this absence of scaling laws. Note ﬁnally that the previously
mentioned small-scale structures that appear on temperature maps close to the surface
are essentially temperature perturbations, which explains why they do not show up in
the corresponding velocity spectra at intermediate wave numbers.

4.2. Isotropic component of equations (2.15)-(2.16)

a slope 4√4π/3
r term is the dominant contribution to the third-order
structure function at moderate to large scales, but forcing by buoyancy is also important
in the same range, as seen on the left plot. As shown by Calzavarini et al. (2002), the
estimate of the Bolgiano length (1.1) is rather crude and the eﬀective Bolgiano length
(corresponding to the crossover between the buoyancy term and
r) at the center
of the convection cell which can be extrapolated from ﬁgure 3 is more likely closer to 1
60) than to 0.1 (r/η = 6). The aspect ratio and set of boundary conditions have
(r/η
a direct inﬂuence on the prefactors of the various relations leading to equation (1.1) and
thus aﬀect the value of the eﬀective Bolgiano length. Another simulation (not presented
here) with aspect ratio 1 and all other parameters remaining constant notably reveals that
LB tends to get smaller in the central plane for convection cells with smaller aspect ratio.
This eﬀect may be related to the presence of a mean wind (plume clustering): as shown
by Rincon et al. (2005), the scale of the mean wind corresponds to the scale at which
a maximum power is injected through buoyancy. In an aspect ratio 1 simulation, these

14

structures have to concentrate in a cube of aspect ratio 1, while they are allowed to spread
over larger horizontal scales at larger aspect ratio. Buoyancy forcing may consequently
be more important at smaller scales in small aspect ratio convection, thus reducing the
eﬀective Bolgiano length. Note ﬁnally that equation (1.1) does not take into account the
fact that the Bolgiano length derived by Bolgiano and Obukhov depends on z-dependent
dissipation rates and is therefore z-dependent as well. Using this exact expression, as
done notably by Calzavarini et al. (2002), does not lead to order of magnitude changes
for LB in the bulk of the convection cell in comparison to the estimation provided by
equation (1.1) for the present simulation. In fact, both expressions rely on dimensional
analysis and must therefore be understood as estimations up to order one prefactors.

Using the eﬀective value LB ≃

so that there should in principle be some room for K41 scalings to occur for η < r < LB.
However, the buoyancy term always remains of the same order of magnitude as the
r term. Also, these two terms have opposite sign, which leads to a signiﬁcant

The most important consequence of having several important contributions to the
third-order structure function is that it does not exhibit any scaling behaviour. To illus-

logarithmic slope. It proves impossible to identify an inertial range on this plot, but note
0
as a veriﬁcation that the local slope of
0 tends to 3 at very small scales, as expected
from classical arguments. It is often claimed that the absence of scaling behaviour in
various ﬂows is due to the smallness of the Reynolds number, because in that case the
viscous term in equation (2.1) can not be neglected a most scales. This is only partly
true for this convective ﬂow, since the viscous term appears to be far smaller than the
r term for r > 0.15 (r/η > 10). Strictly speaking, the smallness of the Reynolds
−
number is mainly responsible for the absence of a very large scale separation between
LB and η here, which leads to the previously mentioned compensation eﬀect. As will
be discussed in
5, deﬁnite scalings in the range η < r < LB may only be observed for
very large Rayleigh numbers. In any case, in a homogeneous ﬂow forced on large scales
only, for which no compensation by a forcing mechanism exist, scalings should in prin-
ciple be observed, at least in a restricted subrange. There is however a supplementary
eﬀect which may prevent scaling laws from showing up even in this favourable situation,
namely anisotropy. In that case, the occurrence of scalings may depend on the way data
is analysed. This point will be further investigated later on in the paper.

Comparing convective turbulence to other types of ﬂows such as channel ﬂows and
shear ﬂows shows that many features of turbulence are shared by all these ﬂows, even
though their forcing mechanisms are completely diﬀerent. For instance, the right plot of
ﬁgure 3 can easily be compared to the ﬁgure 5 of Danaila et al. (2001). These authors
studied the eﬀect of inhomogeneity on third-order structure functions for the channel
ﬂow by assuming isotropy, which is however not completely satisﬁed in the ﬂow. The

budgets of the two ﬂows are very similar. Buoyancy appears to play almost the same role
in Rayleigh-B´enard convection as shear forcing in a shear ﬂow. The same conclusions re-
garding the determination of structure functions exponents can be drawn for both ﬂows,
since the forcing remains important at all scales in both cases.

(cid:16)
neglects advection of the mean temperature proﬁle term in comparison to the

Inhomogeneity is seen to give a signiﬁcant contribution to the third-order structure func-

0, as can be seen on the same plot, is also proportional to r on large scales

4.2.2. Analysis oﬀ the central plane

The main problem with the SO(3) decomposition of structure functions is that the
analysis must be restricted to rather small scales r in regions close to the boundaries
of the system (for wall-type boundary conditions). In such regions, the computation of
reduced structure functions with r lying in planes parallel to the boundaries remains the
only available tool (see Calzavarini et al. (2002) for an application to Rayleigh-B´enard
convection). Remembering that the symmetry properties listed in
2 disappear oﬀ the
central plane, it is however interesting to push the SO(3) analysis as far as possible from

this region in order to observe trends of the z-dependence of inhomogeneous eﬀects. A
brief description of turbulent statistics at z = 1/4 is given to this end. At this altitude, the
maximum r for which turbulent statistics can be computed is only 15η, so that care must
be taken in the interpretation of the results. For such a restricted range of correlation
lengths, it is clear that at most a beginning of inertial range can be expected and that
probing inhomogeneous eﬀects proves diﬃcult, since these eﬀects should be dominant on
scales comparable to the integral scale of the ﬂow only.

As can be seen on ﬁgure 9 and ﬁgure 10, the behaviour of the various terms in equa-
tions (4.2)-(4.3) for r < 15η and z = 1/4 is not very diﬀerent from the case z = 1/2
at ﬁrst sight. There is however a slight diﬀerence concerning inhomogeneous eﬀects in
the velocity equation, which may be due to the closeness of the bottom wall: ﬁgure 11
reveals that normal pressure diﬀusion, which was small at small scales for z = 1/2, gives
a signiﬁcant contribution at the same scales for z = 1/4. This term is notably seen to

4.3. Anisotropic sectors

In the preceding paragraphs, two important assumptions of the K41 theory have been
tested in the case of turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection. The homogeneity hypothe-
sis has been shown to be violated for r/η > 20. The assumption of large-scale forcing
has been shown to be very crude, since buoyancy forcing remains important at all non-
dissipative scales of the simulation, even though the eﬀective Bolgiano length is com-
parable to the depth of the convective layer. It has thus been argued that the absence
of scaling behaviour in turbulent convection at Ra = 106 was mostly related to these

Anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inertial range scalings in turbulent convection

21

eﬀects, and that in the ideal situation of a homogeneous ﬂow at Reλ = 30 forced on large
scales only, inertial range scalings should be observed. There is however a possible supple-
mentary cause for the apparent lack of inertial range scalings in turbulent ﬂows, namely
anisotropy. This has been demonstrated by Arad et al. (1999a) for the channel ﬂow and
will be demonstrated in this paragraph for Rayleigh-B´enard convection. An important
remark is that in mildly turbulent numerical simulations, anisotropy may be caused by
diﬀerent eﬀects. It may be due to physical eﬀects such as spherical symmetry breaking
by gravity or the presence of horizontal plates in the system, as outlined in the intro-
duction, but may also be related to the fact that simulations are done in cartesian boxes
that break the rotational symmetry too. This phenomenon has been notably pointed out
by Biferale, Gualtieri & Toschi (2000), who have shown that the projections of structure
functions on anisotropic sectors were non-vanishing for a DNS of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence performed in a cartesian domain. These various eﬀects are diﬃcult to disen-
tangle. In order to quantify the exact contribution of spurious numerical anisotropy, it
would be necessary to perform statistical analyses at much higher resolutions which, as
mentioned in the section about numerics, is unfortunately not feasible currently. In every
numerical study of anisotropic eﬀects in turbulence, one should therefore keep in mind
that spurious eﬀects are present and consider the results with some caution.

The analysis is restricted to the central plane z = 1/2. The largest sectorial order ℓ
considered in this paragraph is 6, for statistical convergence reasons. The scale-by-scale
budgets for the anisotropic sectors read

These budgets involve extra terms related to anisotropy in comparison to equations (4.2)-

complete third-order structure functions result from a linear combination (with weights
given by the spherical harmonics functions) of these various signiﬁcant contributions,
which may follow distinct scaling laws if foliation occurs, it is expected that genuine

inertial range scalings predicted by isotropic theories should be diﬃcult to observe for
reduced structure functions, which correspond to the complete structure functions taken
at a polar angle θ = π/2 only and therefore involve the contribution of all even spherical

slopes of the same objects. The shape and local logarithmic slopes of the reduced structure
functions diﬀer substantially from those of the ℓ = 0 components, which shows that
anisotropic components (especially ℓ = 2, as can be seen on both plots of ﬁgure 17)
have a marked inﬂuence on the local scaling exponents of reduced structure functions. In
the case of
, one ﬁnds for instance that the local exponent of the reduced structure
function for r/η = 20 is approximately 0.8, while the ℓ = 0 component exponent is 1
at the same correlation length, as shown earlier in the paper and on the right plot of
ﬁgure 18. A similar analysis stands for
(left plot of ﬁgure 18). Such diﬀerences can
Uri
h
not be ignored, since they are larger than typical intermittency corrections to inertial
range scalings and than diﬀerences between concurrent theories of turbulence. Inertial
range scaling exponents obtained via an analysis of reduced structure functions should
therefore be regarded with caution, at least when the ﬂow is fully three-dimensional. For
the same reasons, computations of structure functions in laboratory experiments, which
rely on single points measurements and on the Taylor hypothesis along a speciﬁc direction
(that of the mean wind in Rayleigh-B´enard convection) will not necessarily lead to correct
measurements of scaling exponents predicted by isotropic theories or to reliable values of
intermittency corrections, because such exponents only apply to the isotropic component
of the structure functions. Note however that the previous conclusions do not mean that
measuring structure functions along a speciﬁc direction does not make physical sense.
For instance, using reduced structure functions may prove useful to analyse scalings in
two-dimensional ﬂows, layered ﬂows or in strongly anisotropic ﬂows such as boundary
layers, where scalings in the directions perpendicular to the shear can be observed. Also,
in regions where the SO(3) decomposition can not be performed, as is the case close to
walls, the only currently available methods of analysis are the computation of reduced
structure functions and single points measurements coupled to the Taylor hypothesis.

The present analysis ﬁnally proves useful to test theoretical arguments on anisotropic
turbulence and the phenomenon of foliation: according to modern theories of anisotropy
(Arad et al. 1999b; Biferale & Procaccia 2005), each ℓ component of structure functions
may follow a distinct inertial range scaling law with a scaling exponent increasing with ℓ.
Although it proves diﬃcult to identify scaling ranges (and therefore scaling exponents)
= 0 sectors of the third-order structure functions in this simulation, the increase
on the ℓ
of scaling exponents with ℓ seems to be qualitatively well veriﬁed, at least it is consistent
with the fact that the ℓ = 2 contribution is more important for large r than for small r
in comparison to the ℓ = 0 component. This may be viewed as an argument in favour of
a small-scale return to isotropy. Note however that deﬁnite conclusions can not be drawn
here because the ℓ = 2 component still remains signiﬁcant for small r (ﬁgure 17). This
may be a ﬁnite resolution eﬀect related to the use of cartesian grids and boxes that do
not have rotational symmetry.

5. Summary and discussion

New results on inertial range scaling laws, scale-by-scale budgets and correlation func-
tions in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection at moderate Rayleigh and Reynolds num-
bers have been reported in this paper. A derivation of generalized Kolmogorov and Ya-
glom equations (2.15)-(2.16), which notably makes use of the SO(3) decomposition of
statistical averages, has ﬁrst been presented. The formalism provides a convenient way of
disentangling inhomogeneous and anisotropic eﬀects in convective turbulence, but it can
also be used to study other anisotropic and/or inhomogeneous numerically simulated or
experimental ﬂows. For this purpose, the buoyancy forcing term in the velocity equation
should be replaced by any appropriate anisotropic forcing mechanism.

The analysis of scale-by-scale budgets in a convection DNS at Ra = 106 has led to the
following conclusions. First of all, a compensation eﬀect between the classical
r
term of the generalized Kolmogorov equation on one hand, inhomogeneous terms, viscous
terms and buoyancy forcing on the other hand, has been demonstrated in the isotropic

4/3

ε
h

−

i

sector of the velocity equation. Among these three terms, buoyancy is the most impor-
tant one. This compensation eﬀect prevents any clear scaling law from showing up at
Reλ = 30 in the case of the third-order velocity structure function. Also, equation (1.1)
has been shown to underestimate signiﬁcantly the eﬀective value of the Bolgiano length,
at least for convective ﬂows in moderate aspect ratio containers. The analysis of the
0
mixed temperature structure function
0 has revealed a scaling behaviour compat-
ΘRi
ible with both K41 and BO59 theories in the central plane, in spite of the presence of
inhomogeneous eﬀects on large scales. Meanwhile, neglecting the term related to advec-
tion of the mean temperature proﬁle, which is required in the BO59 theory, has been
shown to be justiﬁed. Scale-by-scale budgets computed oﬀ the central plane have led to
similar conclusions. An interesting inhomogeneous eﬀect at z = 1/4 is the signiﬁcant
contribution of pressure diﬀusion normal to the bottom wall.

h

A spherical harmonics spectrum of structure functions has ﬁnally revealed that the low
ℓ degree contributions to the third-order structure functions are not small in comparison
to their isotropic counterparts at moderate to large scales. It has particularly been shown
that using reduced structure functions at ﬁxed polar angle in the bulk of a convection cell
in order to reveal scaling behaviour predicted by isotropic theories is misleading, since
these structure functions involve linear combinations of various ℓ components which
scale diﬀerently with respect to r. This argument also indicates that using single points
measurements in the bulk of three-dimensional ﬂows together with the Taylor hypothesis
in the particular direction of a mean ﬂow to test the predictions of asymptotic dimensional
isotropic theories of turbulence or to calculate intermittency corrections to these theories
may lead to signiﬁcant biases. It has however been outlined that using reduced structure
functions may still be appropriate when the direction along which these functions are
computed has a special importance, as is the case for instance in layered ﬂows or boundary
layers. Also, it has been pointed out that spurious anisotropies related to the use of
cartesian domains in simulations of mildly turbulent ﬂows, which are diﬃcult to quantify,
certainly interfere with the genuine anisotropic eﬀects due to gravity. Thus, the respective
amplitudes of the various ℓ components of structure functions at moderate Reynolds
number has to be considered with some caution. Independently of the problem of the
origin of anisotropies, these results conﬁrm the analysis of Arad et al. (1999a) for the
channel ﬂow: disentangling anisotropic eﬀects can not be avoided if one wants to study
the scaling behaviour of anisotropic systems correctly. Besides, even though the study of
the r-dependence of diﬀerent ℓ components in equations (2.15)-(2.16) seems to indicate
qualitatively small-scale return to isotropy in the case of Rayleigh-B´enard convection,
it can not be ruled out that anisotropic eﬀects persist at small scales, even at very
high Reynolds numbers. Small-scale anisotropies (called “ramp-cliﬀ structures”) have for
instance been reported in studies of turbulent mixing of passive scalars (Mestayer et al.
(1976); Antonia & Van Atta (1978), see also Warhaft (2000)).

An important issue is to which extent the present results can be used to infer scaling
behaviour at very high Rayleigh and Reynolds numbers. The still important contribution
of buoyancy forcing to the scale-by-scale budget at scales smaller than LB naturally
raises the question of how many scale decades are required in a turbulent convective
ﬂow in order to be able to identify deﬁnite scalings. In the soft turbulence regime, where
Raγ with 1/4 < γ < 1/3 (Grossmann & Lohse 2000), the Bolgiano length should

not depend signiﬁcantly on Ra. For instance, following equation (1.1), LB ∼
is obtained for γ = 2/7 (Procaccia & Zeitak 1989). In the hard regime where it has

should remain constant (with respect to both Ra and P r in that case, while the P r
dependence in the hard turbulence regime depends on whether P r > 1 or P r < 1),

On the contrary, the ratio between the dissipation scale and the eﬀective Bolgiano scale

for r close to LB, but as the buoyancy term should scale like r9/5 above LB according
to BO59, the actual local scaling exponent close to LB may not be very diﬀerent from
this 5/3 value. The important point here is that this exponent be larger than 1 (which is
the exponent of the
r term). According to these scalings, non-dissipative scales

as small as 3

ten times smaller than the

r term, one should then look for a regime where

to exceed several times 109 to obtain a ﬂow with η < 10−3LB. Even in this situation,
deﬁnite scalings are expected only in the subrange 10η < r < 0.1LB, that is over one
decade. The main problem is that two scale separations r
η must
simultaneously be satisﬁed, which can only occur at very high Rayleigh number. This is
an important argument to understand why inertial range scalings have been diﬃcult to
identify in experimental or numerical turbulent convection studies.

For the preceding reasons, it is probable that various results on scaling exponents ob-
tained in the range 106 < Ra < 109 (e. g. Calzavarini et al. (2002), who have computed
local scaling exponents from reduced structure functions) are biased simultaneously by
anisotropic eﬀects and signiﬁcant buoyancy forcing at r < LB. The lack of complete K41

Verzicco & Camussi (2003) may also be a hint that inertial range scalings in anisotropic
ﬂows such as Rayleigh-B´enard convection can not be understood easily using isotropic
theories. If inhomogeneity and isotropy were to play an important role in the scaling
behaviour of very high Rayleigh number convective turbulence, the present results could
serve as guidelines to study them in detail. More generally, the SO(3) decomposition of
structure functions appears to be a very powerful (and necessary) tool to study various
anisotropic ﬂows. It should be particularly helpful to use it when possible in research
domains such as astrophysics or atmospheric sciences, where anisotropic turbulence is
ubiquitous. Such an investigation for strongly stratiﬁed non-Boussinesq turbulent con-
vection, which is relevant to the Sun and other stars, is currently underway.

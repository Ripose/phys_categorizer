(Received 27 January 2014)

The stability of the incompressible boundary layer in the axial ﬂow past a cylinder has
not been studied a great deal. The laminar ﬂow is shown here to be always stable at
high transverse curvatures to linear as well as secondary disturbances. At low levels of
curvature, the ﬁrst instability is delayed, but several non-axisymmetric modes are simul-
taneously unstable, which could lead to a diﬀerent breakdown to turbulence. This predic-
tion, as well as the envisaged downstream relaminarisation of turbulent ﬂow especially on
relatively thin bodies, lend themselves to experimental and numerical veriﬁcation. The
ﬂow is shown to be inviscidly stable at any curvature.

1. Introduction

At low to moderate freestream disturbance levels, the ﬁrst step in the process of tran-
sition to turbulence in a boundary layer is that at some streamwise location, the laminar
ﬂow becomes unstable to linear disturbances. While this instability and the events that
follow have been investigated in great detail for two-dimensional boundary layers during
the past century, a surprisingly small amount of work has been done on its axisymmet-
ric counterpart, the incompressible boundary layer in the ﬂow past a cylinder. Practical
applications on the other hand are numerous. For example, the axial extent of turbulent
ﬂow would determine the signature that submarines leave behind themselves, apart from
the drag. The transition to turbulence over the bodies of large ﬁsh too would be par-
tially controlled by transverse curvature. The instability is expected to be of a diﬀerent
character from that in two-dimensional boundary layers, since Squire’s (1933) theorem,
stating that the ﬁrst instabilities are two-dimensional, is not applicable in this case. The
eﬀect of transverse curvature on the linear and secondary modes of instability is thus the
focus of this paper. We present results only for the ﬂow past a cylinder, but the equations
derived here and the solution method can be used for arbitrary axisymmetric bodies. We
note in contrast that longitudinal curvature, and the resulting G¨ortler (1940) vortices on
concave walls, have been well studied (see e.g. Benmalek & Saric 1994; Itoh 1996).

Rao (1967, 1974) was the ﬁrst to our knowledge to study the stability of incompress-
ible ﬂow past a cylinder. In his work, the equations were not solved directly and the
stability estimates had severe limitations. More recently, Tutty et al. (2002) studied the
linear stability problem and showed that non-axisymmetric modes are less stable than
axisymmetric ones. The critical Reynolds number was found to be 1060 for the n = 1
mode and 12439 for n = 0.

Supersonic and hypersonic ﬂow past axisymmetric bodies, on the other hand, are rela-
tively well-studied. Duck (1990) studied the inviscid stability of boundary layer ﬂow past

2

a circular cylinder at Mach numbers of 2.8 and 3.8. The existence of two distinct unstable
axisymmetric modes was shown. The ﬁrst mode disappears rapidly when the transverse
curvature term is introduced, while the second mode shows a reduction in ampliﬁcation
rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric helical mode is shown by Malik & Spall (1991)
to be destabilized by transverse curvature at ﬁnite Reynolds numbers at a Mach number
of 5. They also show that body divergence has a stabilising inﬂuence for all disturbances.
Most other studies deal with high speed ﬂow over cones. In the linear stability study of
supersonic ﬂow past sharp cones of Mack (1987), the eﬀect of curvature was neglected.
Chen et al. (1989) included the eﬀect of transverse curvature and found that the tran-
sition Reynolds number on a sharp cone at a Mach number of 3.5 is less than that for
a ﬂat plate boundary layer. Stetson et al. (1991) demonstrated qualitative diﬀerences
in the stability of hypersonic planar and conical boundary layers. In transonic ﬂow at
low Reynolds number, Macaraeg & Daudpota (1992) found that the axisymmetric ﬁrst
mode is stabilised as curvature is increased. Seddougui & Bassom (1997) showed that
transverse curvature has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the stability of hypersonic ﬂow past cones
when the attached shock is taken into account. Recent work on the same ﬂow ( Stephen
2006) shows that nonlinear eﬀects become stronger with increase in curvature. Ming et al.
(2006) investigated the spatial evolution of two-dimensional disturbances in supersonic
sharp cone boundary layers using direct numerical simulations. The results agree well
with linear stability theory. In summary, the eﬀect of transverse curvature on supersonic
and hypersonic boundary layers is to stabilize some modes and destabilize others. The
eﬀect depends on the Mach number, the Reynolds number, the sharpness of the cone,
etc.

A survey of the literature thus shows that the linear stability of incompressible axisym-
metric boundary layers needs to be studied. To our knowledge the secondary instability of
axisymmetric boundary layers has not been studied before. In this paper, we show that
the overall eﬀect of transverse curvature on incompressible boundary layers is to sta-
bilise both linear and secondary disturbances. Remarkably no instability is found at any
Reynolds number at higher curvatures, i.e., when the boundary layer thickness becomes
comparable to the body radius.

2. Mean ﬂow

Before performing stability calculations we need to obtain the unperturbed laminar
ﬂow by solving the incompressible steady boundary layer equation for the axial compo-
nent of velocity:

Here the x coordinate is along the surface of the body and r is normal to the body
surface and measured from the body axis. The respective velocity components in these
co-ordinates are U and V . The length and velocity scales which have been used for non-
dimensionalisation are the body radius, r0, and the freestream velocity, U∞, respectively,

The solution is obtained by a 3-level implicit ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme on a uniform grid.
At the leading edge, two levels of initial data are provided, and downstream marching
is commenced. The discretised equation is second order accurate in ∆x and ∆r, and is
unconditionally stable in the von Neumann sense. A fairly ﬁne grid in the r direction is
necessary to capture the velocity and its derivatives accurately. With a grid size of 10−3
in the x and r directions the results are accurate upto 7 decimal places.

Velocity proﬁles at a Reynolds number of 10000 are seen in ﬁgure 2(a) to be in good
agreement with the results of Tutty et al. (2002). The dimensionless boundary layer
thickness δ (≡ r0.99 − 1, where Ur0.99 = 0.99) is plotted in ﬁgure 2(b). When scaled by the
local boundary layer thickness, there is not much of a diﬀerence visible in the proﬁles, as
seen in ﬁgure 3(a) where the Reynolds number is 4000. Here the coordinate r∗ is measured
from the body surface. A marked diﬀerence near the wall is however evident in the second

stability behaviour. Speciﬁcally, an increasingly negative second derivative is indicative
of a fuller, and therefore stabler, proﬁle downstream.

¿From the plot of d2U/dr2 it is clear that the boundary layer is not similar, which
means that there are two parameters in the problem, namely, the Reynolds number and
the surface curvature S0 deﬁned below. Deﬁning a parameter

where the subscript d denotes a dimensional quantity, we may convert the partial diﬀer-

Here g′ = 2U , and the explicit dependence on x is contained in Sx. It is evident that

3. Linear stability analysis

Based on present wisdom, and our own experience in boundary layer ﬂows, we make
the assumption that non-parallel eﬀects are small. Flow quantities are decomposed into
their mean and a ﬂuctuating part, e.g.

~vtot = U (r)~x + ~v(x, r, ρ, t)

(3.1)

where ~v = u~x + v~r + w~ρ, ρ being the azimuthal coordinate. It is most convenient to
represent disturbance velocities in terms of generalized stream-functions (Rao 1967) ψ

3.1. Inviscid stability characteristics

It is instructive to ﬁrst study what happens under inviscid conditions. For two-dimensional
ﬂow, the existence of a point of inﬂexion in the velocity proﬁle is a necessary condition
[Rayleigh (1880)] for inviscid instability. The axisymmetric analog of this criterion has
been derived for various situations e.g., Duck (1990) obtained the generalised criterion
for axisymmetric disturbances on axisymmetric compressible boundary layers.

In brief, in the inviscid limit we may eliminate all variables except v in the momentum

and continuity equations for the linear perturbations, to get

From a procedure similar to that for two-dimensional ﬂows, a necessary condition for
instability, that the quantity I ≡ U ′′ − [(α2r2 − n2)/r/(α2r2 + n2)]U ′, has to change sign
somewhere in the domain, is obtained. Letting r → ∞, we recover the two-dimensional
Rayleigh criterion.

Unlike in two-dimensional ﬂows, the quantity I depends on the streamwise and az-
imuthal wavenumbers, but in order to check for instability it is suﬃcient to evaluate the
limiting cases I1 and I2 respectively for α/n → 0 and n/α → 0. Using equations 2.1 and
2.6, I1 and I2 can be written as

At the wall and at the freestream, g and g′′ are equal to zero, so I2 is zero too. In
between, I2 is always negative since both g and g′′ are positive. I1 is negative everywhere
as well, i.e. I never changes sign. In ﬁgure 4 these quantities are plotted for a sample
case. We conclude that the incompressible axisymmetric laminar boundary layer on a
circular cylinder is inviscidly stable at any curvature.

In two-dimensional boundary-layers, the inﬂexion point criterion has provided a general
guideline for viscous ﬂows as well, since a ﬂow with a fuller velocity proﬁle typically
remains stable up to a much higher Reynolds number. We may therefore expect from
ﬁgure 4 that an axisymmetric boundary layer will be stabler than a two-dimensional one.
Also as the curvature increases (not shown) the tendency to stabilise will be higher. Note
that a change of sign in I may happen on converging bodies. We do not consider that
case here, but mention that the axisymmetric analog of Fjφrtoft’s theorem,

where Us is the velocity at the inﬂection point, being a stricter criterion than the Rayleigh
could then be used. The above may easily be obtained by again a procedure similar to
two-dimensional boundary layers [Fjortoft (1950)]. A future investigation on converging
axisymmetric bodies could tell us whether and when the inviscid mode becomes domi-
nant.

r = 1 to r = L + 1 and to cluster a larger number of grid points close to the wall, by a
suitable choice of γ. We ensure that L is at least 5 times the boundary layer thickness,
so that the far-ﬁeld boundary conditions are applicable. Eigenvalues obtained using 81
and 161 grid points are identical up to the sixth decimal place.

We compare our critical values with those of Tutty et al. (2002) in table 1, and ﬁnd
them to be in reasonable agreement. The helical mode (n = 1) is destabilised ﬁrst at a
Reynolds number of 1013, and x = 581. The axisymmetric (n = 0) mode is unstable only

wavenumbers are plotted in ﬁgure 5. The surface curvature S0 is shown on the upper

large curvatures, i.e., at some point downstream. This observation is consistent with our
expectations from the inviscid analysis. The same behaviour is repeated at all values of the
azimuthal wavenumber n. In other words, we expect that all neutral stability boundaries
must form closed loops, which our calculations bear out. For example, neutral stability
boundaries of the axisymmetric (n = 0), the helical (n = 1) and the n = 2 modes are
shown in ﬁgures 6 to 8 respectively. Though we have performed computations over a

for clarity and the qualitative behaviour is apparent. As the Reynolds number increases,
the ﬂow becomes unstable more upstream, and the loops close further downstream. The
range of unstable wavenumbers also increases with the Reynolds number. The closing tail
of the neutral loops becomes thinner at higher curvatures and the instability is restricted
to small wavenumbers.

For higher azimuthal wavenumbers, the region of instability is much further upstream
and restricted to a small range of curvature, and shown in ﬁgure 9 for n = 3 and n = 4.
It is only the helical (n = 1) mode which is unstable over a signiﬁcant axial extent
of the cylinder. Even this mode is never unstable for curvatures above S0 = 1, as may
be seen in ﬁgure 10. At curvature levels below this, as well as at low Reynolds numbers,
the helical mode is expected to decide dynamics. In compressible axisymmetric boundary
layers, Duck & Hall (1990) showed that there is a critical radius of the body, above which
the ﬂow is found to be stable. However in our incompressible analysis, the ﬂow is unstable
below certain radius. The qualitative diﬀerence is due to the compressibility eﬀects.

Figure 10. Critical Reynolds number as a function of curvature for the mode n = 1.

The energy budget of axisymmetric disturbance (n = 0) is shown in ﬁgure 11a at
a streamwise location x = 60. The Reynolds number is 20,000 and α = 0.125. The
production shows a maximum near the critical layer, where U ≈ cr and the dissipation
is maximum near the wall. There is a local minimum of the dissipation near the critical
layer, which becomes less pronounced downstream. In ﬁgure 11b the production and
dissipation rates are plotted for the mode n = 1. The ﬂow conditions are the same as in
the previous case. The behaviour is similar to the axisymmetric mode. The energy balance
of mode n = 2 is plotted in ﬁgure 12a. The ﬂow conditions are same as the previous cases.
The production is maximum near the critical layer. At streamwise location x = 60 the
dissipation is maximum near the wall. The behaviour of the mode n = 3 is similar to the
n = 2 mode, as shown in ﬁgures 12b.

Since the production layers overlap, we again hazard a guess that many modes can

interact to give earlier non-linearity than in a two-dimensional boundary layer.

In ﬁgure 13a, the location of critical layer (ycr) along streamwise distance is plotted.

The location of the critical line U = cr is shown by the dashed line.

The production of disturbance kinetic energy is expected to be maximum near the critical
layer. It is seen that the critical layer is moving towards the wall. It implies that the
production of disturbance is conﬁned to a region close to wall. This argument is more
clear from the phase diﬀerence of streamwise (u) and normal velocity(v). The production
rate is maximum when u and v are in phase and is zero when they are out of phase (i.e
φ = (2n − 1)π/2). The phase diﬀerence is shown in ﬁgure 13b for a Reynolds number of
20,000. At a small streamwise location the production layer is spread over large region
across boundary layer. At a large streamwise distance, the the production layer is conﬁned
to a small region.

4. Secondary instabilities

A laminar ﬂow containing linear disturbances of a signiﬁcant amplitude is unstable to
secondary modes. The Λ-structures seen in Klebanoﬀ et al. (1962) and Kachanov (1994),
considered to be the precursors of turbulent spots, are a signature of these modes. As a
thumb rule, non-linearity in boundary layers becomes detectable when the amplitude of
the linear (primary) disturbance is 1% of the mean ﬂow.

The approach we follow is standard, as in Herbert (1988). The periodic basic ﬂow now

Equations 4.4 to 4.6 reduce to the secondary instability equations of a ﬂat plate bound-
ary layer by letting S = 0, m+S → β, m−S → −β and nS = 0. The system is solved as
before. Disturbance growth rates for a zero pressure gradient boundary layer agree well
with those of Herbert (1988).

4.1. Results
The main ﬁnding is that for high levels of curvature the ﬂow is stable to secondary
modes as well, but secondary modes can extend the curvature range over which distur-
bance growth is possible. As in the case of a two-dimensional boundary layer subhar-
monic modes are dominant here too. The most unstable secondary modes are of opposite
obliqueness, with azimuthal wavenumber m+ = 2n and m− = −n.

The growth rate of secondary instability at a Reynolds number of 1000 and n = 1
is presented in ﬁgure 14a. The amplitude Ap of the primary wave is taken to be 2% of
U∞, but the answers do not depend qualitatively on this choice. The ﬂow is seen to be
unstable to secondary modes under conditions where all primary disturbances decay. For
comparison the growth rate of the least stable primary disturbance (α = 0.125 and n = 1)
is shown as a dotted line. The streamwise extent of the instability increases as the wave
number decreases. The maximum growth occurs when α = 0.30, and k+ = k− = 0.15. As
discussed earlier m+ = 2 and m− = −1 in this case. The behaviour at a higher Reynolds
number, as seen in ﬁgure 14b, is as expected.

The least stable secondary modes for other values of the azimuthal wavenumber n are
shown in ﬁgure 15. It is clear that in the range of Reynolds numbers of interest, these
modes are not expected to dominate. The axisymmetric mode is not shown, but does not
aﬀord any surprise either.

5. Conclusions

The boundary layer in the ﬂow past a cylinder is stable at high curvatures to linear and
secondary disturbances. This indicates that a turbulent axisymmetric boundary layer,
especially over a thin body, would have a tendency to relaminarise downstream. Our
studies indicate that experimental and numerical studies of this problem will uncover
new physics. The ﬂow is inviscidly stable at any curvature.

Squire’s theorem does not apply, so at low levels of curvature several non-axisymmetric
modes are simultaneously unstable, unlike in a two-dimensional boundary layer . The
production layers of the disturbance kinetic energy of these modes have a signiﬁcant
overlap, which gives rise to the possibility of earlier development of nonlinearities. Thus,
while transverse curvature increases the Reynolds number of the ﬁrst instability, it can
contribute once instability sets in to a quicker and diﬀerent route to turbulence. Future
experimental and numerical studies to check this prediction are called for.

The dominant linear mode is the helical (n = 1), which is both unstable at the lowest
Reynolds number, as well as over the greatest axial extent of the cylinder. Even this mode
is never unstable for curvatures above S0 = 1. Transverse curvature thus has an overall
stabilising eﬀect, acting via the mean ﬂow and directly through the stability equations.
Secondary disturbances are unstable at larger curvatures than linear modes. However
there is again a maximum curvature (S0 ≈ 2 for Ap = 0.02) above which all disturbances

decay. The most unstable secondary modes are always those whose azimuthal wavenum-
bers are related to that of the primary mode by m+ = 2n and m− = −n. For a helical
primary mode this means that one of the secondary perturbations is helical as well, but
of opposite sense, while the other has the same sense but two waves straddling the body.
As in two-dimensional boundary layers the subharmonic (in terms of axial wavenumber)
modes are least stable.

A motion of point vortices with periodic boundary conditions is studied by using Weier-

strass zeta functions. Scattering and recoupling of a vortex pair by a third vortex becomes

remarkable when the vortex density is large. Clustering of vortices is examined by a proba-

bility distribution of velocity circulation of circles in the two-dimensional ﬂow.

KEYWORDS: point vortex, two-dimensional turbulence, Mathematica

A statistical approach to a problem of assemblies of point vortices (PVs) goes back to

Onsager (1949). A state of negative temperature is considered to be related to clustering

of vortices rotating in the same direction and the inverse energy cascade predicted in the

two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (2D NS) turbulence. In many numerical simulations, PVs are

bounded in a circular wall, since a velocity ﬁeld due to a PV can be computed by including

a single mirror image. Although the axisymmetry with respect to the origin is conserved, the

spatial homogeneity is not guaranteed in such a circular system. There has been a numeri-

cal diﬃculty in a simulation of vortices in a box that there emerges an inﬁnite sequence of
mirror images. Stremler and Aref (1999)1 applied a passive particle method and showed the

complicated motions of three PVs in a periodic parallelogram. Our objective is to study such

turbulent motions of many PVs in a periodic box using Weierstrass elliptic functions and

Mathematica.

Let us start by representing the 2D NS equation in terms of a complex position z = x + iy,

velocity q = u

iv, pressure p and the kinematic viscosity ν as

qt + qq¯z + ¯qqz =

2pz + 4νqz ¯z.

Here, ¯q denotes the complex conjugate of q and we use the relations ∂x = ∂z + ∂¯z, ∂y =

According to Tkachenko,2, 3 the velocity ﬁeld due to a single PV at the origin with periodic

boundary conditions (BCs) is equivalent to that due to PVs on the lattice zmn = 2mω1 +2nω2,

where the complex numbers ω1, ω2 are the half periods of the lattice and m, n are arbitrary

integers. The ratio of two periods τ = ω1/ω2 can be restricted in the region

We concentrate on the case of square periodic BCs, which is usually adapted for numerical

studies of the two-dimensional turbulence by a choice of τ = i. However, we can deal with

an arbitrary periodic parallelogram by considering various values of τ satisfying the condition

The velocity ﬁeld due to a PV of strength κ = 2π is given by the Weierstrass zeta function

ζ(z; ω1, ω2) along with a rigid rotation term as follows:

Since the vortex lattice undergoes rigid rotation with angular velocity Ω given by

the second term in Eq.(7) is necessary in order to cancel the rotation on the boundary. The

vortex density n = 1/[4Im(¯ω1ω2)], the angular velocity Ω and the vortex strength κ are related

If the length of the side of the square is unit, then ω1 = 1/2, ω2 = i/2, Ω = π and the vortex

strength κ becomes 2π.

The equation for the streamline ψ = const., where ψ is the streamfunction, is equivalent

to dx/ψy =

dy/ψx. Using the relations u = ψy and v =

ψx, ψ is expressed as

The sigma and zeta funcions of Weierstrass are related as

From the above expression, the Hamiltonian, which is a total kinetic energy minus self induced

kinetic energy of vortices, can be interpreted as a sum of kinetic energy due to an interaction

between pairs of vortices.

If Mathematica is used, we can compute the Weierstrass zeta function as we use the sinu-

soidal function in a Fortran code. The system (7,14) is solved numerically by the NDSolve of

Mathematica 5.2 installed in the PC having an AMD Athlon 64x2 3800 CPU, 2GB memory

and Windows XP OS. The computation is realistic since the CPU time in such a PC environ-

ment is order of two days for 100 PVs and 10 eddy turnover times and the relative precision

of the conserved quantities is tolerable, as described below.

If PVs lie in an unbounded domain, the system has four integrals,4 the Hamiltonian

has no circular symmetry, A is no more constant, but H, Ix, and Iy remains to be conserved.

Since there are three conserved quantities, the system of three vortices is integrable, while the

four vortices show chaotic motions.

Another example is a numerical simulation of a vortex sheet. PVs of the same strength

(18)

· · ·

The simulation is done with N = 100 and ǫ = 0.02. If ǫ is ﬁxed and N is increased, pairing

of two adjacent vortices becomes more conspicuous than the winding of the sheet due to the

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Figure 3 shows contours of ψ and the location at t = 0.001 and

0.002. The contour plot is comparable with those obtained in the two-dimensional Navier-

Stokes simulation, although the plot of PVs reminds us the possibility of the singularity of

the vortex sheet.

and t = 0.1.

Finally we show a numerical result of a simulation of 100 PVs (N1 = N2 = 50) which are
initially located randomly. The relative precision of H is conﬁrmed to be less than 10−6 up to

the ﬁnal time t = 0.1. Figure 4 shows the distributions of PVs and the contours of ψ at t = 0

A remarkable feature in this turbulent situation is that there are several pairs of a positive

and negative vortex moving linearly at a velocity κ/4hπ, where 2h is a distance of two vortices.

Since the pair is surrounded by a number of other isolated vortices, however, the moving

direction is bent by a third vortex when they pass each other. Moreover, if the collision is

nearly head-on, a vortex of the pair with the opposite sign of the third target vortex replaces

its partner by the latter and then continues to move linearly again. An exact analysis of such

scattering of three vortices in an unbounded domain was already given in Appendix of Aref
(1979)5 using elliptic integrals.

Examples of scattering and recoupling of three vortices in a periodic box are given by

an initial location (z1, z2, z3) = (L + iL, (L + d + h)i, (L + d

h)i) with L = 1/2. A pair of

vortex 2 and 3 is approaching vortex 1 initially. Figure 5 shows their trajectories in the cases

h = 0.02 and d =

tf = 0.1 for d = 0.16, tf = 0.05 for d = 0.32 and tf = 0.06 for d =
0.01. Recoupling is
observed for d = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16. Corresponding to Figure 11 in Aref (1979),5

the dependence of a π-normalized scattering angle δφ/π measured by the moving direction of

z3(t = 0.04) for h = 0.02 in a periodic box is shown in Figure 6. The recoupling of vortices in

an unbounded plane with L

On the other hand, the present simulation in a periodic box with h = 0.02 shows a shift of

In a GIF animation made by the numerical simulation of N1 = N2 = 50 PVs, successive

scattering and recoupling, similar to chaos in the billiard system, are clearly observed. An

existence of such vortex pairs may play a crucial role of stirring assemblies of vortices. Itera-

tions of scattering is revealed in Figure 7, showing a trajectories of a positive vortex having

the shortest distance to a negative vortex. A longer distance between dots located on lines
denotes A larger velocity. The time step is 10−4 and 103 points are plotted in Fig. 7. The

linear movement of a vortex pair may be closely related to the ﬁlamentation of a vortex patch

observed in the numerical simulation of the 2D NS turbulence.

Since an average distance of randomly located PVs is l

In order to examine clustering of PVs, the probability distribution function (PDF) of
velocity circulation is investigated, which is studied in Umeki (1993)6 in three-dimensional
turbulence motivated by Professor Migdal’s work.7 If PVs of strength 2π are randomly dis-

tributed in a square of unit length, which is the case of the initial condition, the velocity

circulation along a circles of radius r (0 < r < 1/2) is 2mπ(1

an integer, m1 (m2) is a number of PVs of positive (negative) strength, and the term r2 is

However, if clustering of PVs occurs, the conﬁguration of PVs will deviate from Eq. (21) and

the probability becomes larger for nonzero m. Since clustering is considered to form a larger

eddy, the deviation will be remarkable at a large r, which is contrary to the normal cascade
in three-dimensional turbulence.6

Figure 8 shows the PDF of velocity circulation 2mπ(1

πr2) along a circle of radius

r = 1/3 by counting a number m = m1

m2 for a random distribution given by Eq. (21), the

exponential distribution, and the numerical data of the initial and ﬁnal states t = 0 and 0.1.

In summary, a method to simulate motions of point vortices with periodic boundary

conditions using Mathematica is described. Numerical examples of quasi-periodic, chaotic and

turbulent motions of PVs with N from 3 to 100 are shown and clustering of PVs are examined

by the PDF of velocity circulation in the two-dimensional ﬂow.

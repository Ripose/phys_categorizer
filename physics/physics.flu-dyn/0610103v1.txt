Abstract

We investigate the dynamics of relaxation, by surface tension, of a family of curved interfaces between an inviscid and
viscous ﬂuids in a Hele-Shaw cell. At t = 0 the interface is assumed to be of the form |y| = A x
, where A > 0, m ≥ 0,
and x > 0. The case of 0 < m < 1 corresponds to a smooth shape, m > 1 corresponds to a cusp, whereas m = 1
corresponds to a wedge. The inviscid ﬂuid tip retreats in the process of relaxation, forming a lobe which size grows
with time. Combining analytical and numerical methods we ﬁnd that, for any m, the relaxation dynamics exhibit
self-similar behavior. For m 6= 1 this behavior arises as an intermediate asymptotics: at late times for 0 ≤ m < 1,
and at early times for m > 1. In both cases the retreat distance and the lobe size exhibit power law behaviors in
time with diﬀerent dynamic exponents, uniquely determined by the value of m. In the special case of m = 1 (the
wedge) the similarity is exact and holds for the whole interface at all times t > 0, while the two dynamic exponents
merge to become 1/3. Surprisingly, when m 6= 1, the interface shape, rescaled to the local maximum elevation of the
interface, turns out to be universal (that is, independent of m) in the similarity region. Even more remarkably, the
same rescaled interface shape emerges in the case of m = 1 in the limit of zero wedge angle.

1. Introduction

Consider a curved interface between a low-
viscosity ﬂuid (for example, water) and a high-
viscosity ﬂuid (for example, oil) in a large horizon-
tal Hele-Shaw cell. If the system is unforced, the
interface undergoes relaxation by surface tension,
ultimately approaching either a straight line, or
a circle (or breaking into several domains which
then become circles). This free boundary problem
is hard to solve, as the governing equations (see be-
low) are non-local. This is especially true when the
interface initially has a complex shape, as observed
in numerous experiments when the viscous ﬂuid is
displaced by the inviscid ﬂuid in radial geometry,
see Ref. [1] and references therein. The initial shape

complexity is caused here by the viscous ﬁnger-
ing instability that develops during the preceding
forced stage of the ﬂow [2,3]. The (strongly) forced
Hele-Shaw ﬂow is a standard paradigm in ﬂuid
dynamics and nonlinear dynamics [4,5,6,7]. The
(small) surface tension there is usually invoked in
order to regularize the otherwise singular dynamics
on small scales. We are interested in this paper in
an unforced ﬂow, where surface tension is the only
driving mechanism. Here is the formulation of the
unforced Hele-Shaw (UHS) ﬂow model that we will
be dealing with throughout this paper. Let one
ﬂuid have negligible viscosity, so that the pressure
in it is uniform. The velocity of the viscous ﬂuid is
v (r, t) = −(H 2/12µ) ∇p (r, t), where p is the pres-
sure, µ is the dynamic viscosity, and H is the plate
spacing [2,3,4,5]. Therefore, the interface speed is

vn = −(H 2/12µ) ∂np ,

where index n denotes the components of the vec-
tors normal to the interface and directed from the
inviscid ﬂuid to the viscous ﬂuid, and ∂np is evalu-
ated at the corresponding point of the interface γ.
The viscous ﬂuid is incompressible. Therefore, its
pressure is a harmonic function:

∇2p = 0 .

p |γ = (π/4) σK ,

The Gibbs-Thomson relation yields a boundary con-
dition at the interface:

where σ is surface tension, and K is the local cur-
vature of the interface, positive when the inviscid
region is convex outwards. Finally, as the ﬂow is un-
forced, we demand

∇p = 0 at r → ∞ .

Equations (1)-(4) deﬁne the UHS problem (see Refs.
[8,9,10] and references therein for a more detailed
discussion). The UHS model gives an instructive ex-
ample of non-local area-preserving curve-shortening
dynamics.

The UHS ﬂow (1)-(4) is not integrable. Moreover,
until recently even no particular analytic solutions
to this class of ﬂows had been found, except for the
simple solutions provided by a linear stability anal-
ysis of a single, slightly deformed ﬂat or circular in-
terface [11]. Recently, some analytic solutions have
been obtained for two special initial interface shapes.
In the ﬁrst of them, the inviscid ﬂuid domain at t =
0 has the form of a half-inﬁnite stripe [12]. As time
progresses, the tip of the stripe retreats and develops
a lobe. At long times, the growing lobe approaches a
self-similar shape, whereas the lobe size and retreat
distance follow a power law in time with diﬀerent
dynamic exponents: 1/5 and 3/5, respectively.

In the second case the assumed form of the invis-
cid ﬂuid was a wedge [13]. As this initial condition,
and Eqs. (1)-(4), do not introduce any length scale
into the problem, the solution is self-similar at all
times, with a single dynamic exponent 1/3 [13]. The
scale-invariant interface shape in this case is given
by the solution of an unusual inverse problem of po-
tential theory. Gat et al. [13] solved this problem
perturbatively for an almost ﬂat wedge, and numer-
ically for several values of the wedge angle.

The results of Refs. [12,13] suggest that the values
of dynamic exponents, and other attributes of the

2

self-similar asymptotics, are determined by the ini-
tial shape of the retreating edge of the inviscid ﬂuid
domain, while the two solutions obtained in Refs.
[12,13] are particular members of a broader family
of solutions. The results of the present paper con-
ﬁrm this scenario. We consider here a more general,
power-law shape |y| = A xm, where A > 0, m ≥ 0,
and x > 0, and show that, for any m ≥ 0, the re-
laxation dynamics exhibit self-similar intermediate
asymptotics: a late-time asymptotics for 0 ≤ m < 1
and an early-time asymptotics for m > 1. The re-
treat distance and the lobe size show, for any m,
a power law behavior in time with exponents and
pre-factors uniquely determined by m. The case of
m = 1, investigated in Ref. [13], is special: here the
self-similarity is exact and occurs for all times t >
0, while the two dynamic exponents merge and be-
come equal to 1/3. Surprisingly, at m 6= 1 the in-
terface shape, rescaled to the local maximum eleva-
tion of the interface, turns out to be universal (that
is, independent of m) in the similarity region. Even
more remarkably, the same rescaled interface shape
emerges in the case of m = 1 in the limit of zero
wedge angle.

Here is a layout of the rest of the paper. In Section
II we generalize to an arbitrary m ≥ 0 the approach,
suggested by Vilenkin et al. [12] for a half-inﬁnite
stripe (m = 0). We present there a simple asymp-
totic scaling analysis that predicts (i) the dynamic
exponents of the self-similar part of the ﬂow, (ii) the
exponent of the power-law tail of the scale-invariant
shape function of the interface, and (iii) the validity
range of the scaling behavior at 0 ≤ m < 1 and m >
1. In Section III we report the results of a numerical
solution of (1)-(4) for the cases of m = 1/4, 1/2 and
5/4, compare them with our theoretical predictions
and report the universality of the rescaled interface
shape. In addition, we present in Section III our new
numerical results for small-angle wedges. A brief dis-
cussion and summary are presented in Section IV.

2. Interface dynamics: theoretical
predictions

Let at t = 0 the interface shape be |y| = A xm,
where A > 0, m ≥ 0, and x > 0. The case of 0 <
m < 1 corresponds to smooth shapes, m > 1 cor-
responds to a cusp, see Fig. 1, while m = 1 cor-
responds to a wedge. The parameter A has the di-
mension of length1−m. This implies that the case of
m = 1, investigated by Gat et al. [13], is special,

as the parameter A does not introduce any length
scale there. We assume in this Section that m 6= 1
and measure the distance in units of ∆ ≡ A1/(1−m),
the time in units of τ = 48µ∆3/(πσH 2), and the
pressure in units of p0 = πσ/(4∆). In the rescaled
variables the interface shape is |y| = xm, while Eqs.
(1) and (3) are parameter-free:

vn = −∂np

and

p |γ = K .

Because of the ﬁnite surface tension, the pres-
sure gradient in the viscous ﬂuid is largest at the
tip, so the tip will retreat along the x-axis and de-
velop a lobe which size will grow with time. Let us
assume (and then test numerically) that the evolv-
ing interface can be fully characterized by two time-
dependent length scales: the curvature radius, R(t),
and the retreat distance, L(t), of the tip. In the lead-
ing order this assumption implies a similarity ansatz,
in the moving frame x1 = x − L(t), for the interface
elevation y = h(x, t) in the lobe region and region II
(see below):

In the scaling regime, the dynamic length scales L(t)
and R(t) exhibit a power law behavior:

L(t) = a tα and R(t) = b tβ ,

(8)

where the exponents α and β and coeﬃcients a and
b are m-dependent. The objectives of this work is
to determine analytically α, β the exponent of the
power-law tail of the scale-invariant shape function
of the interface Φ [x1/R(t)], and the validity range
of the scaling behavior at 0 ≤ m < 1 and m > 1.
These analytic ﬁndings will be veriﬁed and comple-
mented by our numerical solutions which, in addi-
tion, provide the whole scale-invariant shape func-
tion Φ [x1/R(t)] and the coeﬃcients a and b of the
power laws of R(t) and L(t) for four diﬀerent values
of m, in Sec. III.

A simple asymptotic scaling analysis for m 6= 1
is possible because of the following property of the
initial shape of the inviscid ﬂuid region: it has a ﬂat
region at either very large distances x ≫ 1 (for 0 ≤
m < 1), or very small distances x ≪ 1 (for m > 1).
We will see that, as a result, the scaling regime will
hold at t ≫ 1 for 0 ≤ m < 1 and at t ≪ 1 for
m > 1. The calculations are very similar to those
of Ref. [12], where the particular case of m = 0
was considered. Introduce for a moment the system
of polar coordinates r and φ with the origin at the
moving tip of the interface, as shown in Fig. 1a. In
view of the Gibbs-Thomson condition (6), p must
vanish, in the leading order, at the ﬂat region, that
is at φ → 0 and φ → 2π. This corresponds either to
the region 1 ≪ R(t) ≪ r for 0 ≤ m < 1, or to the
region R(t) ≪ r ≪ 1 for m > 1. Furthermore, in
view of the same Eq. (6), p = K ∼ 1/R(t) in the lobe
region (for deﬁniteness, at φ = ±π/2). Therefore,
the leading term of the far-ﬁeld multipole expansion
of p [14] can be written as

p(r, φ, t) = Cm [R(t) r]

−1/2 sin(φ/2),

(9)

where Cm = O(1). Having demanded the boundary
condition (6) in Eq. (9), we stretched the validity
region of Eq. (9), r ≫ R(t), toward r ∼ R(t), but
this can only aﬀect the value of constant Cm that
our theory cannot give anyway. Now we can employ
Eqs. (5) and (9) and estimate the normal component
of the interface speed in the far ﬁeld region. For the
upper interface of the far ﬁeld region

At this point we return to the Cartesian coordinates

x1 for 0 ≤ m < 1 or R(t) ≪ x1 ≪ 1 for m > 1, the
quantity ∂h(x1, t)/∂t is given by Eq. (10), and we
obtain

As we will check a posteriori, L(t) is always much
greater than R(t) in the scaling regime. How can we
simplify the calculation of the intergal in Eq. (11)?
The far ﬁeld region x1 ≫ R(t) can be divided into
two sub-regions: x1 ≫ L(t) (region I) and R(t) ≪
x1 ≪ L(t) (region II, or neck). In region I we can, in
the leading order, take x3/2
out of the integral and
arrive at

where we have assumed that R(t) is a power of t,
and disregarded the coeﬃcient Cm = O(1).

In region II at ﬁxed x, the main contribution to
the integral in Eq. (11) comes from times close to
t, so that x1(t)/ ˙L(t) ≪ t − t′ ≪ t . Indeed, we can
expand x1(t′) = x1(t) + ˙L(t)(t − t′) + . . . and, in
the leading order, neglect higher order terms. The
eﬀective time interval for the integration is (t−δt′, t),
where δt′ ∼ x1(t)/ ˙L(t). Furthermore, R1/2(t′) can
be evaluated at t′ = t, as its variation on the time
interval (t − δt′, t) is negligible. Then, extending the
lower limit of the integral to −∞ and calculating the
remaining elementary integral, we obtain

h(x1, t) − xm ∼

Cm
R1/2(t) ˙L(t)x1/2

where the factor Cm = O(1) is in excess of accuracy
and can be disregarded. Now we can estimate the
contributions of regions I and II to the area gain δA
in the far ﬁeld region. In region I (correspondingly,
II) the main contribution to the integral over x1
comes from the lower (correspondingly, upper) limit
of integration. Therefore, we integrate Eq. (12) over
x1 from, say, 2L(t) to inﬁnity, and Eq. (13) from
R(t) to 2L(t). The results are:

in region I ,

and

δAII (t) ∼

L1/2(t)

in region II .

As, by assumption, L(t) is a power law, δAI is com-
parable to δAII . As we will check shortly, the con-
tribution to the area of the lobe region itself, δAR ∼
R2(t), is negligible compared to δAI and δAII as
long as we are in the scaling regime (t ≫ 1 for 0 ≤
m < 1 or t ≪ 1 for m > 1).

Now we employ the exact integral of motion of the
system: the area conservation of each of the ﬂuids.
The area loss because of the retreat [which is equal
to L(t)m+1/(m + 1) ∼ L(t)m+1] must be equal, in
the leading order, to the area gain in the far ﬁeld
region. This follows

L(t)m+1 ∼ δAI (t) ∼ δAII (t) ,

which yields a relation between the two dynamic
length scales R(t) and L(t). Another relation be-
tween these two quantities follows from Eq. (9). We
obtain Vl ∼ −∂p/∂r [r ∼ R(t), φ ≃ π] ∼ R−2(t),
and demand

˙L(t) ∼ R

−2(t) .

These two relations immediately yield the dynamic
exponents α and β:

α =

3
4m + 5

and

β =

2m + 1
4m + 5

.

(16)

Once the scaling relations for L(t) and R(t) are
found, we can calculate [up to m-dependent numer-
ical pre-factors O(1)], additional quantities. For ex-
ample, the interface elevation in region I becomes

h(x, t) − xm ∼ t

3(2m+3)
2(4m+5) x

−3/2 ,

see Eq. (12). In region II, see Eq. (13), we obtain

(13)

h(x, t) − xm ∼ t

3(2m+1)
2(4m+5) x

−1/2 .

Importantly, region II belongs to the similarity re-
gion, as was ﬁrst observed in Ref. [12] in the case of
m = 0. In this region Φ(ξ) ∼ ξ−1/2: a universal (m-
independent) power law of the similarity variable
ξ = x1/R(t). The presence of the decreasing asymp-
tote Φ(ξ) ∼ ξ−1/2 implies that, for any m 6= 1, the
shape function Φ(ξ) must have a local maximum.

Once we obtained the solution, we can check it for
self-consistency with all the assumptions we made.
First, it can be easily checked that, in the scaling
regime t ≫ 1 (for 0 ≤ m < 1) or t ≪ 1 (for
m > 1) we have L(t) ≫ R(t), as we assumed. Now,
the lobe area δAR ∼ R2(t) grows with time as ∼
t2(2m+1)/(4m+5). This value is indeed much less than
δAI (t) ∼ δAII (t) ∼ t3(m+1)/(4m+5) in the scaling
regime. Furthermore, the time-dependent interface
elevation in the lobe region R(t) ∼ L(t)(2m+1)/3 is

much larger, in the scaling regime, than the initial
interface elevation at the moving tip, which is L(t)m.
This strong inequality serves as a necessary condi-
tion for the assumed similarity asymptotics (7) as a
leading order description.

3. Numerical solution

In order to test the predicted dynamic exponents
α and β and verify the presence of the self-similar
regime, we solved the problem numerically for three
diﬀerent values of parameter m. In addition, we re-
turned to the case of m = 1, previously considered
in Ref. [13], and solved it numerically for small val-
ues of the wedge angle.

3.1. Numerical method

Our numerical algorithm [16] employs a variant of
the boundary integral method for an exterior Dirich-
let problem formulated for a singly connected do-
main, and explicit tracking of the contour nodes.
The harmonic potential is represented as a potential
produced by a dipole distribution with an a priori
unknown density D on the contour. The dipole den-
sity D is found numerically from an integral equa-
tion which is a modiﬁcation of the well-known jump
relation of the potential theory [17]. Computing an-
other integral of this (already found) dipole density,
one obtains the harmonic conjugate function, whose
derivative along the contour yields, by virtue of the
Cauchy theorem, the normal velocity of the inter-
face.

We used a piecewise constant function for a dis-
crete approximation of D and a piecewise linear
function for discretizing the interface. The integral
entering the integral equation is represented as a
sum of D multiplied by a kernel which is integrated
analytically between two neighboring nodes. This
approximation was previously suggested for the in-
ner problem [15]. We found that it is also eﬃcient
in the outer problem in the following cases: (i) for
a long and slender domain, (ii) in the vicinity of
the cusp at m > 1, and (iii) for a wedge (m = 1)
with a small angle. The numerical approximation
is described in detail in Ref. [16]. The method re-
quires an inhomogeneous grid with a small spacing
in regions of high curvature of the contour, and we
used a grid with spacing exponentially growing with
the distance from the interface’s tip. The number of
grid nodes was reduced as the interface’s perimeter

5

decreased, and the curvature radius of the tip in-
creased.

The shape of the numerical interface at t = 0 is de-
termined by the following parameters: the exponent
m, the domain size Λ > 0, and the cutoﬀ parameter
ε > 0 that was used for m ≥ 1, see below. One quar-
ter of the interface is represented as a graph h(x) =
(x + Λ)m, where −Λ + ε ≤ x ≤ 0. The second quar-
ter is obtained by reﬂecting this graph with respect
to the x-axis. Then, by reﬂecting the two branches
with respect to the y-axis, we obtained the closed
interface we worked with. In this manner we could
exploit the four-fold symmetry of the domains and
achieve a four-fold reduction in the number of al-
gebraic equations, approximating the integral equa-
tion. For m < 1, the tip is smooth, and we took ε =
0. For m > 1 there is a cusp at x = −Λ that our nu-
merical method can not handle. A similar diﬃculty
arises for m = 1 if the wedge angle is very small. A
positive ε allows one to employ the method, if the
node spacing in the cutoﬀ region is less than εm.

We measured the retreat distance of the tip L(t)
and the interface shape at diﬀerent rimes for three
values of m: m = 1/4, 1/2 and 5/4, and also for
three diﬀerent wedge angles for m = 1. In the pro-
cess of relaxation, each of these domains ultimately
becomes a perfect circle. Therefore, to observe the
self-similar asymptotics we performed the measure-
ments at times much shorter than the characteristic
time of relaxation toward a circle. In addition, to
minimize the inﬂuence of other tips, we performed
the measurements suﬃciently close to a chosen tip
(at distances much smaller than the distance be-
tween the chosen tip and the neighboring tip). These
two limitations are especially relevant at m < 1,
where theory predicts self-similarity at suﬃciently
long times. On the contrary, at m > 1 we performed
the measurements at very short times. Here the main
limitation comes from the presence of the cutoﬀ,
which necessitates a suﬃciently long “waiting time”
so that the inﬂuence of the cutoﬀ on the solution
can be neglected.

For m = 1/4 we took Λ = 2 × 104 and the mini-
mum node spacing δS = 1/2. The spacing increased
exponentially with the distance from the tip, and
the initial number of nodes was 2 × 103 (here and
in the following – per quarter of the interface). For
m = 1/2 we chose Λ = 105, δS = 1 and the initial
number of nodes 103. The set of numerical param-
eters for m = 5/4 was Λ = 10−3, δS = 10−8, ε =
(2 × 10−8)4/5 = 6.93 × 10−7, and the initial number
of nodes 1200.

For m = 1 and the wedge angles θ = 10◦ and 5◦
we used Λ = 1, δS = 10−5, and the initial number
of nodes 103. The cutoﬀ parameter ε was chosen to
be ε = 3δS cot θ ≈ 0.017 for θ = 10◦, and 0.034 for
θ = 5◦. For θ = 2o we took Λ = 3 · 10−3, δS = 10−6,
the initial number of nodes 2 · 103, and the cutoﬀ
parameter ε ≈ 2.8 · 10−5.

In all cases the time step was chosen to be 10−3
times the maximum of the ratio of the interface cur-
vature radius and the interface speed at the same
node. This choice of numerical parameters was dic-
tated by the fact that, at 0 < m < 1, we were in-
terested in a long-time behavior, whereas at m > 1
we needed to focus on very earlier times, in order to
observe the predicted self-similarity and scalings.

3.2. Numerical results

Figure 2 shows snapshots of a part of the sys-
tem for m = 1/4 at times t = 0, 2.7 × 105 and
1.2×106. One can see a lobe developing and growing
with time. Shown in Fig. 3a is the retreat distance
L(t) versus time. A power law ﬁt yields exponent
0.50 which coincides with the predicted theoretical
value 1/2, see Eq. (16). It is more convenient numer-
ically to measure the local maximum height of the
interface hmax(t), rather than the curvature radius
at the tip R(t). Because of the self-similarity, the
quantities hmax(t) and R(t) are expected to exhibit
the same power law dependence (of course, with dif-
ferent pre-factors). Fig. 3b shows hmax versus time
in the case of m = 1/4. It is seen that this depen-
dence approaches a power law. The ﬁtted exponent

The numerical results for m = 1/2 are presented
in Figures 5, 6 and 7. Here too power laws for L(t)
and R(t) are observed, and the ﬁtted exponents 0.44
and 0.28 are in good agreement with theoretical val-
ues 3/7 ≃ 0.43 and 2/7 ≃ 0.29, respectively. The
shape function again shows self-similarity, with a
rapid (in time) convergence in the lobe region, and
a much slower convergence in the neck.

The numerical results for m = 5/4 are shown in
Figures 8, 9 and 10. Here the self-similar regime is
observed at very short times. The observed expo-
nents of the power laws (0.29 for α and 0.35 for β
are in good agreement with theoretical values α =
0.3 and β = 0.35. The shape function shows self-
similarity in the lobe region, and a rapid deterio-
ration of self-similarity in the neck as the time in-
creases.

Our numerical results for the dynamic exponents
α and β at diﬀerent m are summarized in Fig. 11.
It can be seen that they follow theoretical curves
predicted by Eq. (16). The numerically found coef-
ﬁcients a and b of the power laws are presented in
Fig. 12.

Figure 13 depicts, on a single plot, a set of rescaled
shape functions for four diﬀerent values of m. Three
of them: for m = 1/4, 1/2 and 5/4, were computed
in the present work, they are the same as shown in
Figures 4, 7 and 10, respectively. The shape func-
tion for m = 0 is taken from Ref. [12]. Remarkably,
all the shape functions coincide in the lobe region.
That is, although the retreat distance and the local
maximum elevation of the interface depend on m,
the rescaled interface shape is independent of m, as

m 6= 1. Unfortunately, it is hard to prove this con-
jecture numerically. We observed that, at m < 1,

when m is close to 1. As a result, one should go to
prohibitively long times (and prohibitively large nu-
merical domain sizes) in order to reach the “pure”
similarity regime in the neck. In its turn, at m >
1 corrections to the self-similar solution grow very
fast with time when m is close to 1, so one has to
go to prohibitively small times in order to observe
the “pure” self-similarity in the neck. This is hard to

Is there any connection between the universal
scaled shape shown in Fig. 13 and the rescaled
interface shapes of the wedge (m = 1) which de-
pend on the wedge angle? To address this question,
we simulated the relaxation dynamics of several
wedges with small angles. Figure 14 shows self-
similar shape functions for three diﬀerent values of
the wedge angle: 10◦, 5◦ and 2◦. Shown on the same
graph is the shape function for m = 0. Remarkably,
all the shape functions coincide in the lobe region.

hibit self-similar intermediate asymptotics: a late-
time asymptotics for 0 ≤ m < 1 and an early-time
asymptotics for m > 1. Our theoretical predictions
for the dynamic exponents of the retreat distance
and the local maximum elevation of the interface
versus time, at diﬀerent m, are in excellent agree-
ment with numerical simulations. We have found
that, for m 6= 1, the rescaled interface shape is uni-
versal, that is, it does not depend on m in the sim-
ilarity region. Remarkably, the same rescaled inter-
face shape also emerges in the case of m = 1 (where
the self-similarity is exact and holds for the whole in-
terface at all times t > 0), in the limit of zero wedge
angle.

Future work should provide a more complete the-
ory that would explain the surprising ﬁndings pre-
sented here. We hope that this work (see also Refs.
[12,13]) will facilitate experimental and further the-
oretical eﬀorts aimed at a better understanding of
the “simple” unforced Hele-Shaw ﬂow.

of m: m = 0 (the black solid line), 1/4 (the red dashed line),
1/2 (the blue dotted line) and 5/4 (the green symbols).

Furthermore, the numerics strongly suggests that,
as the wedge angle tends to zero, the shape func-
tion approaches that for m = 0 everywhere. That
is, the observed universal shape function for m 6= 1
coincides with the shape function obtained in the
zero-angle limit for m = 1.

4. Summary

We have investigated the dynamics of relaxation,
by surface tension, of a family of curved interfaces,
dividing an inviscid and viscous ﬂuids in a Hele-
Shaw cell, and characterizable by a single exponent
m. A stripe m = 0, a wedge m = 1 and a generic
cusp m = 2 that appears after a pinch-oﬀ event, rep-
resent particular cases of these more general shapes.
Combining simple analytic arguments with a ro-
bust numerical method, we have found that, for any
m 6= 1, the relaxation dynamics of the interfaces ex-

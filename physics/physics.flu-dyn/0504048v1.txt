A ﬂuid droplet may exhibit self-propelled motion by modifying the wetting properties of the
substrate. We propose a novel model for droplet propagation upon a terraced landscape of ordered
layers formed as a result of surface freezing driven by the contact angle dependence on the terrace
thickness. Simultaneous melting or freezing of the terrace edge results in a joint droplet-terrace
motion. The model is tested numerically and compared to experimental observations on long-chain
alkane system in the vicinity of the surface melting point.

Motion of mesoscopic liquid droplets is a challenging
problem both in view of numerous technological applica-
tion in surface treatment, microﬂuidics, etc., and fun-
damental questions arising on the borderline between
macroscopic and molecular physics. Diﬀerent scenarios
of droplet motion are determined by liquid-substrate in-
teractions, and may incorporate surface phase transitions
and chemical reactions, as well as more subtle modiﬁca-
tion of physical properties in interfacial regions. One
can distinguish between three classes of behavior: pas-
sive, interacting, and active. A passive droplet gains
mobility due to imposed forces, e.g.
temperature gra-
dients [1] or substrate heterogeneity [2]. Motion of in-
teracting droplets is mediated by ﬂuxes through a thin
precursor layer [3, 4]. Finally, active droplets may pro-
pel themselves by modifying the substrate either through
surfactant deposition at the three-phase contact line [5]
or through chemical reaction proceeding directly on the
substrate at the foot of the droplet [6, 7].

A new type of self-propelled motion discovered recently
in experiments with long-chain alkanes [8] is associated
with surface phase transitions creating a terraced immo-
bilized layer between the ﬂuid and substrate, as shown
schematically in Fig. 1. The system includes (a) a dis-
ordered bulk liquid alkane droplet; (b) one or more or-
dered (smectic A) alkane layers formed as a result of sur-
face freezing; (c) a molecularly thin disordered precursor
layer. The thickness ratio l/d ≫ 1 of the smectic and
precursor layers is determined by the aspect ratio of the
alkane molecule. The plateau height is H = N l, where
N ≥ 1 is an integer. A similar situation may arise in
layered adsorption, leading to the formation of ordered
immobilized molecular layers also in the case of the as-
pect ratio l/d ∼ O(1).

Due to a diﬀerence in molecular interaction strengths
between the bulk ﬂuid and the smectic and the sub-
strate, the contact angle of the bulk droplet depends on
the number of smectic layers, and therefore the droplet
is expected to move when placed on a terrace as in

FIG. 1: A scheme of a droplet on a terraced smectic layer.
l and d denote, respectively, the molecular dimensions along
and across the long molecular axis; H is the terrace height, h
is the bulk droplet height, and θ± are the contact angles on
the upper and lower plateaus.

Fig. 1. Moreover, as temperature is varied, the terrace
surface freezing process may proceed in two ways, de-
pending on whether it is limited by material supply or
removal of latent heat. The ﬁrst mechanism involves slow
spreading, with the smectic layer growing sidewise, be-
ing augmented by ﬂuid molecules migrating from the bulk
droplet through the precursor [9]. The second mechanism
is fast, and involves terrace growth synchronous with the
droplet motion [8]. Melting, being unconstrained by ma-
terial supply, proceeds by the second mechanism in re-
verse. In this Letter, we suggest a model of self propelled
droplet motion accompanied by surface freezing or melt-
ing on terraced landscape.

We adopt the lubrication approximation, which ac-
counts for diﬀerent scalings in the vertical and the hor-
izontal directions [10]. The approximation is applicable
in a liquid ﬁlm with a large aspect ratio, when the in-
terface is weakly inclined and curved. The scaling is
consistent if one assumes ∂z ∼ O(1), ∇ ∼ O(ǫ) ≪ 1,
∂t ∼ O(ǫ2), where ∇ is the two-dimensional gradient in
the horizontal plane. This scaling also implies a small
contact angle, θ ∼ O(1) and results in a diﬀerent or-
der of magnitude of the vertical and horizontal veloci-
ties, vz ∼ O(ǫ2), vx ∼ vy ∼ O(ǫ). As a consequence,

the pressure or, more generally, a driving potential W is
constant to O(ǫ2) across the layer in z direction. The
governing equation for the droplet height h following the
mass conservation condition reads:

∂th = −∇ · j ,

j = −η−1k(h)∇W , W = σǫ2∇2h − Π ,
(1)
where j is the mass ﬂux, η is the dynamic viscosity, and
k(h) is the mobility coeﬃcient, σ is surface tension, and
Π is the disjoining potential due to interaction with the
solid support (including both substrate and smectic lay-
ers).

Computation of Π is the key component of the model.
We assume that all interactions are of the van der Waals
type with the hard core potential V (r) = ∞ at r < d,
V (r) = −Ajr−6 at r > d, and diﬀer by interaction con-
stants Aj only. Since the motion is, on the one hand,
caused by the diﬀerence in contact angles on the two
sides and, on the other side, is driven by excess free en-
ergy of either freezing or melting, the diﬀerence between
the liquid-terrace (At) and liquid-substrate (As) interac-
tion constants should change sign when the temperature
passes the surface melting point. Equilibrium contact an-
gles can be expressed through the interaction constants
by integrating Eq. (1) for an inﬁnite bulk ﬂuid in equi-
librium as explained below.

For a ﬂuid on top of a ﬂat homogeneous plateau, z > H
(see Fig. 1), the free energy per unit area can be written,
in a local density functional approximation [11], as

Here n(z), nt, ns are the ﬂuid, terrace, substrate par-
ticle densities and f (n) is free energy per particle of a
homogeneous ﬂuid. The ﬁrst term in the integrand is
the free energy per particle in the homogeneous ﬂuid;
the second term compensates lost ﬂuid-ﬂuid interactions
in the domain z < H which are included in f (n); the
third term accounts for the inhomogeneous part of ﬂuid-
ﬂuid interactions; the last two terms represent the ﬂuid-
terrace and ﬂuid-substrate interactions. All interactions
are described by the same hard core interaction poten-
tial diﬀering only by interaction strength, A (ﬂuid-ﬂuid),
At = αtA (ﬂuid-terrace) and As = αsA (ﬂuid-substrate).
The interaction kernel Q(ζ) lumping intermolecular in-
teraction between the layers z = constant [11] is ex-
pressed then as Q(ζ) = 1

Since the precursor layer is of molecular thickness,
the chemical potential shift is computed diﬀerently in
the bulk and precursor regions; this is unlike other self-

2

propelled active drop models [7] where a macroscopic pre-
cursor layer was presumed. In the bulk region z > H + d
the chemical potential shift µ(h) − µ0 from the equilib-
rium value in the bulk ﬂuid, µ = µ0, depends on the
ﬂuid thickness h and coincides with the disjoining po-
tential, Π(h) = ∂hγ [12]. Neglecting the vapor density,
as well as density variation in a molecularly-thin inter-
facial layer, we can apply the sharp interface approxi-
mation [13], assuming the ﬂuid density to be constant,
n = n0 at H + d < z < h, where n0 is the equilibrium
ﬂuid particle density at µ = µ0, n = 0 at z > h. Deﬁning
γ(h) by Eq. (2) with the upper integration limit over z
replaced by h and the homogeneous part excluded, we

The precursor ﬁlm is assumed to be of a constant
molecular thickness d, but the liquid density is allowed
to vary there, and is determined by minimizing the grand
ensemble thermodynamic potential F = γ − µ
n dz.
The disjoining potential is identiﬁed here with the shift of
chemical potential per unit volume Π (n) = n[µ(n) − µ0]
relative to the equilibrium value µ0 as a function of the
local value of n (shifted from its bulk equilibrium value
under the action of the terrace and substrate). It is de-
termined by the Euler–Lagrange equation derived from
the integrand of (2) for z = H + d:

The mobility coeﬃcient, k(h), is also computed sepa-
rately in the bulk and precursor regions and matched at
the precursor thickness. In the bulk region, Stokes ﬂow
with a kinematic slip condition [14] is assumed, while
in the precursor domain the mass transport is presumed
to be purely diﬀusional. This yields the mobility coeﬃ-
cient [14]

The motion of a droplet placed on terraced landscape
as in Fig. 1 can be attributed to a diﬀerence in equilib-
rium contact angles at the upper (H +) and lower (H −)
terraces. The rescaled angles can be calculated for χ < 0,
|χ| ≪ 1 by integrating the static equation W = 0 [11],
which reduces to σǫ2hxx = Π. In the limit h → ∞ we

where h0 ≈ H ± + d. The direction of the droplet motion
is determined solely by the eﬀective terrace–substrate in-
teraction, i.e. by the sign of χα: the droplet either as-
cends for χα > 0 or descends for χα < 0 until equi-
librium is reached. The equilibrium condition θ+ = θ−
is satisﬁed either by H + = H − or χα = 0. The for-
mal small parameter of the lubrication approximation
can be deﬁned by setting θ = 1 for χα = 0, which yields
|χ|An2/(σd2). Since σ ∼ n2A/d2, a good estimate
ǫ ∼
is ǫ ∼
p

A decrement of contact angles should be preserved to
maintain droplet propagation. This is possible when the
terrace edge is also allowed to move. The terrace motion
due to surface freezing or melting was observed in the
experiment [8] when ambient temperature T was varied
in the vicinity of the surface freezing point Tm. When
the terrace is at the foot of a liquid droplet, the melting
or freezing rate is limited by the heat ﬂux q required to
supply or remove the latent heat L, so that Lρv = q ≈
K(T − Tm)/h, where K is thermal conductivity and ρ
is density (assumed to be equal for both liquid and the
frozen terrace layer). The approximate expression for
the heat ﬂux (directed almost normally to the substrate
or terrace) corresponds to the lubrication approximation.
The form of this relation deﬁning the edge position x is

Synchronous droplet-terrace motion under melting
conditions is shown in Fig. 2. This joint propagation
can be explained in terms of terminal velocity of the ter-
race. While the terrace is below the droplet, the droplet
velocity is determined by the diﬀerence in contact angle
values, according to (6). On the other hand, the terrace
velocity (for a ﬁxed ∆) depends solely on the thickness
of the liquid layer above the terrace edge. At the start,
the droplet moves to the left, while the terrace remains
almost stationary because of slow transport through a
thick layer, as shown Fig. 2(a-b). As the ﬂuid height
above the edge decreases, the terrace gains speed [see
Fig. 2(b-c)], until it reaches an “equilibrium” position,
such that the point at the droplet interface just above

in the inset of Fig. 3. As the terrace passes the maximum
hc − H + decreases to
droplet’s height, the critical value
unity (i.e. the precursor thickness). The droplet velocity
at the same time drops to zero, while the terrace velocity
(dashed line) jumps abruptly. Similar behavior has been
also observed experimentally [9].

We have proposed a model for self-propelled droplets
on top of a terraced landscape driven by surface freezing
or melting. The numerical estimates show the charac-
teristic terrace edge velocity v ∼ O(102) [µm/sec] close
to the experimental data [8] at temperature variations
around the surface melting temperature |T − Tm| ∼
O(10−3)[0K] and hc ∼ O(d) ∼ 0.1[nm].

hc moves with the same
the edge where the thickness is

hc. The stable position should lie near the
trailing edge; then, if the terrace moves faster than the
droplet, the liquid layer thickness above it increases and
hc re-
the terrace decelerates. As a result, the value
mains constant, as seen in Fig. 2(c-d)] and more precisely
in inset of Fig. 2(d). This dynamic feedback allows the
droplet and the terrace to synchronize their motion. We
found that synchronous propagation velocity only weakly
depends on the number N and layers thickness H + = N l.

In the freezing case, the droplet volume decreases, since
the total mass of the system is conserved and the ﬂuid is
solidiﬁed. The droplet and the terrace may still jointly
propagate as long as the droplet height is relatively large
compared to the precursor thickness, as shown in Fig 3(a-
c). In a such motion the droplet and the terrace preserve
the equilibrium height
hc [see Fig. 3(b-c)]. As the
droplet volume decreases below the equilibrium height
hc, the terrace propagates faster than the droplet and
b
runs out to its leading edge [see Fig. 3(d-e)]. Following
this, the motion stops, since further terrace propagation
is limited by slow material supply through the precursor,
and the droplet is left in an equilibrium state on the top
of a ﬂat smectic layer [8]. This behavior is also presented

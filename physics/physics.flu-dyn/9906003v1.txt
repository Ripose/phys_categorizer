Scaling properties of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence

The scaling properties of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence are obtained from
direct numerical simulations of decaying turbulence using 5123 modes. The results indicate that the
turbulence does not follow the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology. The spectrum is consistent
with k
In the case of hyperresistivity the structure functions exhibit a clear scaling range
yielding absolute values of the scaling exponents ζp, in particular ζ3 ≃ 1, consistent with a recent
analytical result. The scaling exponents agree with a modiﬁed She-Leveque model ζp = p/9 + 1 −
(1/3)p/3, corresponding to Kolmogorov scaling but sheet-like geometry of the dissipative structures.

Magnetic turbulence is the natural state of a plasma
in motion, especially in astrophysical systems. The con-
venient framework to describe such turbulence is magne-
tohydrodynamics (MHD). For high magnetic Reynolds
number Rm = vl0/η, where v is a typical turbulent ve-
locity, l0 the integral scale and η the magnetic diﬀusivity,
there is a broad range of scales l between l0, and the dis-
sipative scale length ld, l0 ≫ l ≫ ld, called the inertial
range which exhibits characteristic self-similarity or scal-
ing properties.

The concept of inertial-range scaling was introduced
by Kolmogorov [1] for hydrodynamic turbulence, which
is called the Kolmogorov (K41) phenomenology. As-
suming homogeneity and isotropy of the turbulence as
well as locality of the turbulent cascade process, he ob-
tains ǫ ∼ (δvl)2/τl = (δvl)3/l yielding the scaling law
δvl ∼ ǫ1/3l1/3. Here ǫ is the energy dissipation rate and,
to be speciﬁc, δvl = [v(x + l) − v(x)] · l/l is the longi-
tudinal velocity increment. A direct consequence is the
Kolmogorov energy spectrum Ek ∼ ǫ2/3k−5/3.

For MHD turbulence the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK)
phenomenology [2], [3] takes into account the Alfv´en ef-
fect, the coupling of small-scale velocity and magnetic
ﬂuctuations by the integral-scale ﬁeld B0. Hence the
natural variables are the Els¨asser ﬁelds z± = v ± B,
which describe Alfv´en waves.
In the IK phenomenol-
ogy the spectral transfer is reduced by the factor τA/τl,
ǫ ∼ (τA/τl)(δzl)2/τl, where τA = l/vA, vA = Alfv´en ve-
locity in the ﬁeld B0, δzl ∼ δvl ∼ δBl ∼ (ǫvA)1/4l1/4, and
the IK energy spectrum becomes Ek ∼ (ǫvA)1/2k−3/2.
This spectrum can also be written in the form Ek ∼
ǫ2/3k−5/3(kl0)1/6 with the integral scale l0 deﬁned by
l0 = v3
A/ǫ, which illustrates the nonlocal character of
the energy cascade in MHD turbulence.

It is, however, well known that these qualitative scaling
relations for δvl or δzl are not exactly valid in a statisti-
cal sense because of intermittency, which implies that the
distribution of turbulent scales is not strictly self-similar.
A quantitative measure is provided by the scaling expo-
nents ζp of the structure functions, the moments of the

ﬁeld increments. For hydrodynamic turbulence She and
Leveque [4] proposed a model leading to the expression
ζSL
p = p/9 + 2[1 − (2/3)p/3], which ﬁts the experimental
results surprisingly well, reproducing in particular the
exact result ζ3 = 1. This model has been modiﬁed for
MHD incorporating the IK eﬀect [5], [6], which yields
p = p/8 + 1 − (1/2)p/4, in particular ζIK
ζIK

4 = 1.

The IK phenomenology has been supported by direct
numerical simulations of 2D MHD turbulence at moder-
ate Reynolds numbers [7]. However, recent developments
in MHD turbulence theory cast some doubt on the gen-
eral validity of the IK scaling. 2D simulations at con-
siderably higher Reynolds numbers reveal an anomalous
scaling behavior [8], [9], indicating that the results of Ref.
[7] are not asymptotic. There have also been theoretical
arguments in favor of a Kolmogorov scaling, e.g., [10],
[11]. Even more convincingly, exact relations have been
derived for moments of certain triple products of δzl [12],
which are shown to be proportional to l, i.e., ζ3 = 1, anal-
ogous to the well-known 4/5-relation in hydrodynamic
turbulence, thus excluding the IK result ζ4 = 1. Scaling
exponents for MHD turbulence have also been derived
from observations in the solar wind [13]. Here agreement
with the IK exponents has been claimed [5], but in this
comparison the observational results were normalized as-
suming ζ4 = 1. Actually the error bars seem to be too
large to reach a deﬁnite conclusion.

To clarify the issue of scaling in 3D MHD turbulence
direct numerical simulations are desirable with higher
Reynolds numbers than studied previously, for instance
in [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. In this Letter we present a nu-
merical study of freely decaying turbulence with spatial
resolution of 5123 modes. The scaling properties are ana-
lyzed by considering the time-averages of the normalized
spectra and structure functions. We solve the incom-
pressible MHD equations

∂tB − ∇ × (v × B) = ην(−1)ν−1∇2ν B,

∂tw − ∇ × (v × w) − ∇ × (j × B) = µν (−1)ν−1∇2νw,

w = ∇ × v,

j = ∇ × B, ∇ · v = ∇ · B = 0,

by applying a pseudo-spectral method with spherical
mode truncation as conveniently used in 3D turbulence
simulations (instead of full dealiasing by the 2/3 rule
used in most 2D simulations). The generalized magnetic
Prandtl number ην/µν has been set equal to unity. Initial
conditions are

which are characterized by random phases αk, βk and
satisfy the conditions k·Bk = k·vk = 0, E = EV +EM =
1 and EV /EM = 1. Further restrictions on Bk arise
by requiring a speciﬁc value of the magnetic helicity
d3x A · B. We believe that ﬁnite magnetic helicity
H =
is more typical than H ≃ 0, since MHD turbulence usu-
ally occurs in rotating systems. The wavenumber k0, the
location of the maximum of the initial energy spectrum,
is chosen k0 = 4, which allows the inverse cascade of Hk
to develop freely during the simulation time of 10 time
units (about 7 eddy turnover times, deﬁning the eddy
turnover time as the time required to reach the maxi-
mum dissipation from the smooth initial state). Though
this choice implies a certain loss of inertial range, the
sacriﬁce is unavoidable in the presence of inverse cascade
dynamics, since assuming k0 ∼ 1 would lead to magnetic
condensation in the lowest-k state, which would also af-
fect the dynamics of higher-k modes. Both normal dif-
fusion ν = 1 and hyperdiﬀusion ν = 2 have been used,
ν = 1 to discuss the spectral properties and ν = 2 to de-
termine the scaling of the structure functions. All runs
presented in this Letter have ﬁnite H, H/Hmax ≃ 0.6,
and negligible alignment. Table I lists the important
parameters of the simulation runs, where the magnetic
Taylor Reynolds number is Rmλ = Rm1/2. Since Rmλ
is not stricly constant during turbulence decay but in-
creases slowly Rmλ ∼ t1/8, we give the values taken at a
speciﬁc time t = 4.

We ﬁrst discuss the spectral properties considering the
angle-averaged energy spectrum Ek. Figure 1 shows the
scatter plot of the normalized spectrum (the normaliza-
tion is discussed below), compensated by k3/2, taken
from run 3 over the period t = 4 − 10 of fully developed
turbulence. The spectrum exhibits a clear scaling range
of almost one decade with a spectral law, which is deﬁ-
nitely steeper than the IK spectrum k−3/2, close to (in
fact slightly steeper than) k−5/3 indicated by the dashed
line. In order to form the time average in a system of
decaying turbulence, the spectrum must be normalized
to eliminate the time variation of the macroscopic quan-
tities. In hydrodynamic turbulence the only such quan-
tity is ǫ, which leads to the universal form of the Kol-
k = klK, where

lK = (η3/ǫ)1/4 is the Kolmogorov length. However, when
normalized in this way the MHD energy spectrum is
found to change during turbulence decay and even more
strongly so when comparing runs of diﬀerent Rmλ. For
ﬁnite magnetic helicity the spectrum may also depend on
H, which introduces a second macroscopic length scale
l1 = H/v2
A in addition to l0, i.e, the spectrum may con-
tain some function of l0/l1. To determine this function
we propose the following argument. Since the Alfv´en
eﬀect is clearly present in the simulations, kinetic and
magnetic energy spectrum being nearly equal at small
scales, while on the other hand the scaling Ek ∼ k−5/3
is observed, we modify the nonlinear transfer in the IK
ansatz by a factor (l/l1)δ,

and determine δ by requiring the observed scaling δzl ∼
l1/3, which gives δ = −1/3 and hence

Ek ∼ ǫ2/3(l0/l1)1/6k−5/3.

Also the dissipation scale length is slightly changed. Bal-
ancing nonlinear transfer and dissipation gives

tions (5), (6) are not valid for H ≃ 0, where we expect
the pure Kolmogorov normalization to be valid.

A more complete picture of the inertial-range distri-
bution of turbulent structures is provided by the scaling
exponents ζp of the structure functions, where the second
order exponent ζ2 is related to the inertial-range spec-
tral law ∼ k−(1+ζ2). To be deﬁnite we consider the mo-
ments of the absolute value of the longitudinal increments

For normal diﬀusion ν = 1 no scaling range is visi-
ble. (Note that the structure function S2 corresponds to
the one-dimensional spectrum Ekx , which has a shorter
inertial range than the angle-averaged spectrum shown
in Fig. 1.) For ν = 2, however, there is a scaling
l < 200, as seen in Fig. 3, where the time-
range 30 <

quasi-constant parts determine the scaling coeﬃcients,
the dashed horizontal lines indicating the most probable
values ζ+
4 ≃ 1.15. These results are consistent
with the spectral law derived from Fig. 1 and are close
to the analytical prediction ζ3 = 1. It is true that the
analytical theory refers to third-order moments diﬀerent
from h|δz|pi discussed here, but the scaling coeﬃcients
should not depend thereof (the scaling range, however,
does). One might object that the use of hyperdiﬀusion
aﬀects the inertial-range scaling, if the scaling range is
not very broad. In fact, the energy spectrum law tends
to be polluted by the bottleneck eﬀect, which is particu-
larly pronounced for hyperdiﬀusion (see e.g., [19]). Thus
the energy spectrum in run 4 (not shown) is eﬀectively
ﬂatter than k−5/3 expected from the value of ζ2. How-
ever, there is, to our knowledge, no argument for a similar
eﬀect in the structure functions.

Assuming the exact result ζ3 = 1 allows to obtain
rather accurate values of ζp by using the property of ESS
(extended self-similarity) [20] plotting Sp as function of
S3. (It should be noted that ESS usually results in almost
perfect scaling behavior, but the scaling coeﬃcients thus
derived vary in time, hence time averaging is required.)
The results are shown in Fig. 4, which gives the ESS
results of ζ+
p for run 4 (diamonds) and the ESS values
ξ+
p /ζ+
3p = ζ+
3 from [21] for 2D MHD turbulence (trian-
gles). (In 2D MHD the absolute values of ζp are found
in [9] to decrease with Rm, while the relative values ξ3p
appear to be independent of Rm.) The results indicate
that in 3D MHD turbulence is less intermittent than 2D,
but it is more intermittent than hydrodynamic turbu-
lence, the continuous curve, which gives the She-Leveque
result ζSL
p . As shown by Politano and Pouquet [6], the
She-Leveque concept contains eﬀectively three parame-
ters: g related to the scaling δzl ∼ l1/g, x related to
the energy transfer time at the smallest, the dissipative
scales tl ∼ lx, and C, the codimension of the dissipative
structures,

Our results for the 3D MHD case suggest Kolmogorov
scaling g = 3, x = 2/3, while diﬀerent from hydrody-
namic turbulence the dissipative structures are sheet-like,
hence the codimension is C = 1,

This is the dashed curve in Fig. 4, which ﬁts the numer-
ical values very well.

In conclusion we have studied the spatial scaling prop-
erties of 3D MHD turbulence using direct numerical sim-
ulations with resolution of 5123 modes. The results indi-
cate that the turbulence does not follow the Iroshnikov-
Kraichnan (IK) phenomenology. The energy spectrum
is consistent with a k−5/3 law. For hyperresistivity the

structure functions exhibit a clear scaling range yielding
absolute values of the scaling exponents ζp, in particu-
lar ζ3 ≃ 1, consistent with recent analytical predictions.
The scaling exponents agree well with a modiﬁed She-
Leveque model ζMHD
= p/9 + 1 − (1/3)p/3, correspond-
ing to Kolmogorov scaling, but sheet-like geometry of
the dissipative structures. The results are also consistent
with observations of turbulence in the solar wind, which
typically show a k−1.7 spectrum.

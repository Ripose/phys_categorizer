Abstract

The evolution of a small-amplitude localized vortex disturbance in an unbounded
shear ﬂow with the linear velocity proﬁle is investigated. Based on the exact solution of
the initial problem for basic ﬂow with a linear velocity proﬁle, a revision is made of the
theoretical approach (suggested by Levinski (1991) and subsequently further developed
in a series of other publications) in which the vortex evolution is described in terms
of Fluid Impulse of the vortex “core”. Although the theoretical predictions obtained
on the basis of this approach were excellently conﬁrmed in subsequent experimental
studies, its inconsistency is demonstrated in this study.

According to the solution obtained, the localized vortex increases slowly (as power-
law with the time) and attains an almost “horizontal” orientation, unlike the previous
theory (Levinski, 1991) that predicts the more rapid growth and vortex orientation
◦
to the ﬂow direction. On the other hand, just the rapid increase
at the angle of 45
◦
and the angle of 45
to the outer ﬂow direction are characteristic for hairpin vortices
observed in turbulent boundary layers or artiﬁcially synthesized vortices in laminar
boundary layers.

Thus the issue of adequate theoretical interpretation of the evolution of localized

vortices is again on the agenda.

DNS and laboratory experiments show that the spatial distribution of straining stagnation points
in homogeneous isotropic 3D turbulence has a fractal structure with dimension Ds = 2. In Kinematic
Simulations the time exponent γ in Richardson’s law and the fractal dimension Ds are related by
γ = 6/Ds. The Richardson constant is found to be an increasing function of the number of straining
stagnation points in agreement with pair duﬀusion occuring in bursts when pairs meet such points
in the ﬂow.

also separate exponentially [1] leading to exponentially
fast stirring and a high potential for mixing. In turbulent
ﬂows, however, pairs of ﬂuid elements separate on average
algebraically [2, 3, 4]. Turbulent ﬂows have a very wide
range of excited length- and time-scales and are therefore
fundamentally diﬀerent from both low-dimensional dy-
namical systems and chaotic advection ﬂows. Attempts
have been made to model the relative diﬀusion of ﬂuid
element pairs in terms of Langevin type equations based
on the assumption that relative Lagrangian accelerations
are Markovian in time [5, 6]. These models can repro-
duce the right algebraic time growth of separation statis-
tics of ﬂuid elements in turbulent ﬂows; but they fail to
explain the very large values taken by the ﬂatness fac-
tor of Lagrangian relative velocities in Direct Numerical
Simulations of isotropic turbulence [6, 7, 8]. In fact these
models based on Markovian acceleration statistics under-
estimate this ﬂatness factor by as much as one order of
magnitude.

The algebraic growth of Lagrangian separation statis-
tics can also be accurately reproduced by Kinematic Sim-
ulations [9, 10, 11]. These are models of turbulent diﬀu-
sion based on kinematically simulated turbulent velocity
ﬁelds which are non-Markovian (not delta-correlated in
time), incompressible and consistent with up to second
order statistics of the turbulence such as energy spec-
tra. Kinematic Simulations are interesting in particular
because they do reproduce the very high ﬂatness fac-
tors of Lagrangian relative velocities [8]. The mecha-
nism by which ﬂuid element pairs separate in Kinematic
Simulations (KS) might therefore be comparable to the
one in turbulent ﬂows and is clearly diﬀerent from the
Wiener process which causes ﬂuid element pairs to sepa-
rate in Lagrangian models of relative diﬀusion based on
Langevin type equations. But what is this mechanism
and why can it give rise to the algebraic growth of rela-

tive separations?

Richardson’s law of turbulent relative diﬀusion states
that the mean square distance between two ﬂuid elements
∆2 is proportional to the third power of time t, i.e.

∆2 (t) ≈ GL2

where γ = 3, G is a universal dimensionless constant and
L and u′ are the integral length-scale and the rms ve-
locity of the turbulence respectively. Richardson’s law
is expected to be valid in homogeneous isotropic turbu-
lence and for times t such that ∆2 is within the inertial
range of scales, i.e. η2 ≪ ∆2 ≪ L2, where η is the Kol-
mogorov microscale. Fluid element pairs follow close tra-
jectories for long stretches of time and separate violently
when they meet straining ﬂow regions around stagnation
[8]
points (straining stagnation points) [9, 11, 12, 13].
noted that the very high ﬂatness factors of Lagrangian
relative velocities are consistent with this conjecture.

[11] found evidence of a fractal spatial distribution of
straining ﬂow regions in KS homogeneous isotropic tur-
bulent velocity ﬁelds. In this paper we quantify their ob-
servation by showing that the number of straining stag-
nation points per unit volume in KS, Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments of homo-
geneous isotropic turbulence is given by

exponent Ds can be interpreted as a fractal dimension.
Both (1) and (2) hold for L/η ≫ 1.

We now describe the DNS and the grid turbulence mea-
surements used to establish (2) with Ds=2. We have used
DNS data of non-decaying homogeneous isotropic incom-
pressible turbulence generated by a standard pseudo-
spectral code with grid resolution of about 2η and have
computed the number of stagnation points in instanta-
neous velocity ﬁelds u = u(x) = (u(x), v(x), w(x)) for a
variety of Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers Reλ rang-
ing from 34 to 130. In this paper we focus our interest on

FIG. 1: Imaginary versus real part of the complex eigenvalues
of the gradient of velocity matrix with positive imaginary part

few complex eigenvalues with small (absolute) real part can be

with DNS for similar values of L/η.

the straining ﬂow regions around stagnation points of u.
A stagnation point does indeed correspond to a straining
ﬂow region when the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient
matrix at this point are all non-zero (see Ottino 1989);
these are regions where the ﬂow is always straining and
may or may not be rotating as well.

We use the Newton-Raphson method (tested against
the amoeba method in various planar ﬂows) to ﬁnd all
stagnation points [14]. This is an iterative method and
requires starting points, which have been taken all over
the DNS ﬁeld at points separated by a distance smaller
than η. Irrespective of Reynolds number, the vast major-
ity of stagnation points have turned out to be in straining
regions. Figure 1 is a scatter plot of the complex eigen-
values of the gradient of velocity matrix. Notice that
the probability to ﬁnd eigenvalues with imaginary part
much larger than the real part is very low. The only case
where stagnation points can be non-straining is when two
eigenvalues are pure imaginary and the third eigenvalue
is zero. Hence the number of stagnation points is there-
fore eﬀectively the same as that of straining stagnation
points, and this number per unit volume is ns. For ev-
ery Reynolds number, we calculate ns, L and η and we
plot ns as a function of L/η (see ﬁgure 2). The relation
between these two quantities appears to be well ﬁtted by
(2) with Ds = 2.

Experimental support for (2) with Ds = 2 has been ob-
tained from grid generated turbulence in the laboratory.
The turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic far enough
from the grid and from the wind tunnel walls. Measure-
ments of the streamwise air velocity u were taken with a
hot wire at the centre of the working section of a wind

tunnel at a distance of 50 mesh sizes behind the grid. We
collected thirty runs of data for thirty diﬀerent values of
Reλ ranging from 68 to 130. The sampling frequency was
30 kHz, enough to resolve the dissipation range except at
the highest values of Reλ but always enough, however, to
resolve the Taylor microscale in all our runs. Each data
set contains more than 100 integral scales. The turbu-
lence intensity was always smaller than 5% thus allow-
ing the use of the Taylor hypothesis for the conversion
of temporal data into spatial data. It is possible, from
these wind tunnel data, to calculate the number of zero-
crossings of u per unit length which leaves us with the
problem of relating this number to the number of stagna-
tion points per unit volume in homogeneous and isotropic
turbulence. Each component of u has an instantaneous
zero-crossing surface in the three-dimensional space of
the ﬂow. These three instantaneous surfaces may have
a fractal dimension larger than or equal to 2. Because
of isotropy, these three fractal dimensions must be the
same and we denote them by D. Stagnation points of u
are intersections of the three zero-crossing surfaces. The
rule of the thumb for estimating the fractal dimension of
intersections of surfaces is that the codimension is equal
to the sum of the codimensions of the intersecting sur-
faces [15]. The codimension of each zero-crossing surface
is D − 2 because surfaces are two-dimensional and the
codimension of the set of their intersections is Ds − 0 be-
cause points are zero-dimensional. Hence, Ds = 3(D−2).
We are assuming our DNS observation that the vast ma-
jority of stagnation points lie in straining regions to be
also true in grid generated turbulence which is why we
use the notation Ds for the fractal dimension of the stag-
nation points of u.

By virtue of the Taylor hypothesis, the zero-crossings

of our one-dimensional u data can be viewed as a set
of point intersections through the zero-crossing surface
u(x) = 0. From our one-dimensional data the codimen-
sion D − 2 can be measured from one data set with a
speciﬁc Reynolds number by applying a box-counting al-
gorithm to the zero-crossings. This method was used by
Sreenivasan and his colleagues (see [16] and references
therein) who found that the fractal codimension D − 2
is indeed well-deﬁned and equal to 2/3. Another way to
measure D − 2 is to count the number of zero-crossings
in diﬀerent data sets corresponding to diﬀerent Reynolds
numbers and relate the zero-crossing numbers per unit
length to L/η. However, because we do not resolve η in
some of our runs, we apply a low-pass ﬁlter of wavenum-
ber 2π/lc in order to remove the poorly resolved dissipa-
tion range and the high-frequency electronic noise of our
measuring device. The ﬁlter wavenumber is in fact equal
to 2π/η for the smallest Reynolds numbers and turns out
to be closer to the Taylor microscale wavenumber in most
cases. This is the method we have applied here and we
have found that the zero-crossing number per unit length
is proportional to (L/lc)2/3 which implies D − 2 = 2/3.
From Ds = 3(D − 2) we deduce Ds = 2 in support of our
DNS ﬁndings.

To explore the relation between the turbulent diﬀusion
of ﬂuid element pairs and the fractal structure of strain-
ing stagnation points in the ﬂow, i.e. between (1) and (2),
we need to ﬁnd ways to modify the spatial distribution
of straining stagnation points and monitor the changes
in turbulent pair diﬀusion brought about by such modi-
ﬁcations. Such a study cannot be carried out with cur-
rent DNS and laboratory experiments of homogeneous
isotropic incompressible turbulence because the spatial
distribution of straining stagnation points is determined
by the Navier-Stokes dynamics and cannot be tampered
with. KS, however, oﬀers the ﬂexibility to chose the en-
ergy spectrum at will and thereby modify, as we show
below, the fractal structure of the set of straining stag-
nation points. An additional advantage of KS is that the
Lagrangian pair diﬀusion statistics it produces compare
well with DNS results when the energy spectrum chosen
is that of the DNS turbulence [8]. KS also succesfully
generates [12] all the pair diﬀusion results of the labora-
tory experiment of [13].

KS uses turbulent-like velocity ﬁelds of the form

u =

An ∧ ˆkn cos(kn · x + ωnt) +

Nk

Xn=1

Bn ∧ ˆkn sin(kn · x + ωnt)

(3)

where Nk (typically of order 100) is the number of modes,
ˆkn is a random unit vector (kn = kn ˆkn), and the di-
rections and orientations of An and Bn are chosen ran-
domly under the constraint that they be normal to ˆkn
and uncorrelated with the directions and orientations of
all other wave modes. Note that the velocity ﬁeld (3) is

3

(4)

incompressible by construction, and also statistically sta-
tionary, homogeneous and isotropic as shown by [9] and
[11]. The amplitudes An and Bn of the vectors An and
Bn are determined by A2

otherwise; u′ is the rms velocity of the KS turbulent-
like ﬂow; ∆kn = (kn+1 − kn−1)/2 for 2 ≤ n ≤ Nk − 1,
∆k1 = (k2 − k1)/2 and ∆kNk = (kNk − kNk−1)/2. The
distribution of wavenumbers is geometric (see Flohr &
Vassilicos 2000), speciﬁcally kn = k1an−1 with a constant
a determined by L/η = aNk−1. The frequencies ωn in (3)
are proportional to the eddy-turnover frequency of mode
n, i.e. ωn = 0.5

nE(kn).

p

We have varied the power p of the energy spectrum in
the range 1 < p < 3 without changing u′. For a given
value of p, we calculate the number of stagnation points
by the Newton-Raphson method for diﬀerent values of
L/η.
It turns out, as in the case of DNS turbulence,
that the vast majority of stagnation points are straining
stagnation points irrespective of the values of p and L/η
(see ﬁgure 1). We also ﬁnd that, when p = 5/3, ns is
proportional to (L/η)Ds with Ds = 2 (see ﬁgure 2), in
agreement with our DNS and wind tunnel results. The
relation (2) is found to hold for all values of p between
1 and 3 in instantaneous realisations of our KS ﬁeld and
in fact DS decreases towards 0 as p increases towards
3. Varying p in KS is therefore a good way to tamper
with the fractal structure of the set of straining stagna-
tion points in the turbulent-like ﬂow and study what the
eﬀects of this tampering are on turbulent pair-diﬀusion.
We have calculated the time-dependence of the mean
square distance between pairs of ﬂuid elements in KS
turbulent-like ﬂows for diﬀerent values of p between 1
and 2 and have found that (1) is valid in the inertial
range with

γ = 6/Ds

(5)

(see ﬁgure 3), and that the Richardson constant G is an
increasing function of Ds. For values of p between 2 and
3 we do not ﬁnd evidence of a well-deﬁned power law
(1) and of course nothing like (5). The reason, which
we believe lies behind this pair-diﬀusion behaviour, is
that for p between 2 and 3 the power spectrum k2E(k)
of the strain rate ﬁeld is concentrated at the smaller
wavenumbers when p > 2 but increases with wavenum-
ber when p < 2. The energy spectrum of a homogeneous
and isotropic gaussian velocity ﬁeld such as (3) for large
enough Nk is related to the fractal dimension of zero-
crossing surfaces by Orey’s relation p + 2(D − 2) = 3 (see
[17]) which implies p + 2Ds/3 = 3. [11] have shown that,
as a consequence of pair-diﬀusion locality, γ = 4/(3 − p).
Hence, (5) is eﬀectively a consequence of velocity ﬁeld
gaussianity and pair-diﬀusion locality.

same value of Ds but Cs decreases with V (see ﬁgure
2). By releasing ﬂuid element pairs in the velocity ﬁeld
u + V we can study modiﬁcations to the Richardson law
(1) caused by the mean ﬂow velocity V. The eﬀects on
(1) parallel those on (2): the exponent γ remains well-
deﬁned in the same range of times and is independent of
V but the Richardson constant G decreases with increas-
ing V (ﬁgure 4). The addition of a constant mean ﬂow
velocity leaves the scaling exponents γ and Ds of the
Richardson law and of the fractal straining stagnation
point structure intact, but reduces the overall number of
straining stagnation points per unit volume and also the
overall extent of turbulent pair diﬀusion. In view of this
conclusion and also of relation (5) there is clearly a corre-
lation between Richardson pair diﬀusion and the fractal
spatial distribution of straining stagnation points in the
turbulent-like ﬂow. Such a correlation hints at a certain
persistence in time of the streamline structure of the ﬂow
which causes pairs to separate when they meet straining
stagnation points. This is consistent with our results that
G is an increasing function of Ds and of 1/V , i.e. an in-
creasing function of the number of straining stagnation
points in both cases.

Another way to modify the straining ﬂow structure of
the KS turbulence is by adding a constant (time and
space independent) velocity vector V to the KS veloc-
ity ﬁeld (3). The KS velocity ﬁeld deﬁned in (3) is a
mean-zero velocity ﬁeld and the addition of V amounts
to a superposition of a constant mean ﬂow. The aim
is to look for stagnation points of u + V and monitor
the changes in the straining stagnation point structure
caused by changes in V = |V| whilst keeping p constant.
Our ﬁrst observation is that (1) remains valid with the

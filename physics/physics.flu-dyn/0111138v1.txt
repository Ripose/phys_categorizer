Investigation of the eigenfrequencies of two interacting gas bubbles using the
direct-numerical-simulation technique

The recent theory regarding the eigenfrequencies of two mutually interacting gas bubbles in an
acoustic ﬁeld is veriﬁed numerically. The theory given by Ida [e-Print physics/0111133; (submitted)]
predicts the existence of three eigenfrequencies per bubble, which make the phase diﬀerence between
a bubble’s pulsation and an external sound be π/2, while readymade theories predict only two
natural frequencies. The direct-numerical-simulation technique, in which the compressible Navier-
Stokes equation is selected as the governing equation, is employed for numerical experiments. We
investigate the eigenfrequencies by observing the direction of the secondary Bjerknes force acting
between pulsating bubbles, which changes as the driving frequency varies. The numerical results
show that the theoretical prediction is valid at least in a qualitative sense.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The secondary Bjerknes force is an interaction force
acting between pulsating gas bubbles in an acoustic ﬁeld
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. While the classical theory originated by
Bjerknes [1, 2, 3] predicts only attraction or repulsion,
recent studies show that the force sometimes reverses
its own direction as the distance between the bubbles
changes [4, 5]. The ﬁrst theoretical study on this subject
was performed by Zabolotskaya [4]. Employing a linear
coupled-oscillator model, she showed that the radiative
interaction between the bubbles could cause this reversal.
In the middle of the 1990s, Doinikov and Zavtrak arrived
at the same conclusion by employing a linear theoreti-
cal model in which the multiple scattering between the
bubbles is more rigorously taken into account [5].

In both the theoretical studies mentioned above, it
is assumed that the reversal is due to the change in
the natural (or resonance) frequencies of bubbles caused
by the radiative interaction between the bubbles. How-
ever, their interpretations on how the natural frequencies
change diﬀer from each other. The theoretical formula
for the natural frequencies, used by Zabolotskaya, shows
that higher and lower natural frequencies (converging to
the partial natural frequencies of smaller and larger bub-
bles, respectively, when the distance between the bubbles
is inﬁnite) reveal upward and downward shifts, respec-
tively, as the bubbles come closer to one another. On
contrast, Doinikov and Zavtrak assumed intuitively that
both natural frequencies rise. Although this assumption
can explain the reversal occurring not only when both
bubbles are larger than the resonance size but also when
one bubble is larger than and the other is smaller than
than the resonance size [5], it is in opposition to the the-
oretical interpretation by Zabolotskaya.

Recently, Ida proposed an alternative theoretical in-
terpretation of this phenomenon [6], also using a linear
model. He clamed that this phenomenon cannot be ex-
plained by using only the natural frequencies, and that it

is important to deﬁne the eigenfrequencies which make
the phase diﬀerence between a bubble’s pulsation and an
external sound be π/2. It was pointed out theoretically
that the number of the natural frequencies and that of
the eigenfrequencies are not in agreement in a multibub-
ble case [7, 8], while they are, as is well known, con-
sistent in a single-bubble case. This theory can explain
the reversal in both cases mentioned above, and does not
contradict the theory for the natural frequencies used
by Zabolotskaya. (In a double-bubble case, Ida’s theory
predicts three eigenfrequencies per bubble, two of which
correspond to the natural frequencies [7].)

The aim of this paper is to verify the theory for the
eigenfrequencies by direct numerical simulation (DNS).
In Ref. [9], Ida and Yamakoshi proposed a DNS tech-
nique for multibubble dynamics in an acoustic ﬁled, in
which the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a
surface-tension term are selected as the governing equa-
tion and are solved by semi-Lagrangian [10] and ﬁnite dif-
ference methods [9, 11]. This technique allows us to com-
pute the dynamics (pulsation and translational motion)
of deformable bubbles in a viscous liquid. (It seems that
the solver for sound propagation, proposed in Ref. [9],
may violate the conservation of mass greatly in a certain
case [12]; we therefore employ a previous one [13] in this
paper.) Using this DNS technique, we perform numer-
ical experiments involving two interacting gas bubbles
in order to investigate the recent theories by observing
the pulsation amplitudes of bubbles and the direction of
their translational motion. In Sec. II, the theories for the
eigenfrequencies and secondary Bjerknes force are brieﬂy
reviewed, and in Sec. III, their numerical results and a
discussion are provided.

ural frequencies given by Eq. (1); it is hard to distinguish the
higher one of bubble 1 and the lower one of bubble 2 from the
eigenfrequencies since these frequencies overlap.

of bubbles 1 and 2, respectively, R10 and R20 are their
equilibrium radii, ω is the driving (angular) frequency,
and D is the distance between the centers of the bub-
bles. In their model used for deriving this equation, the
sphericity of bubbles and the incompressibility of the sur-
rounding liquid are assumed and the damping factors
are neglected. This equation predicts the existence of
two natural frequencies per bubble. The higher and the
lower natural frequencies reveal upward and downward
shifts, respectively, as the distance between the bubbles
decreases.

and predicts that, regardless of the distance D, a bubble
has three eigenfrequencies and, among those three fre-
quencies, two correspond to those predicted by Eq. (1)
(the terms in the second (· · ·) correspond to those on
the left hand side of Eq. (1)). Namely, two of the eigen-
frequencies correspond to the natural frequencies, while
that remaining has a diﬀerent characteristic.

Figure 1 shows the eigenfrequencies, ω1 and ω2, for
R10 = 5 µm and R20 = 9 µm as functions of D/(R10 +
R20), given by Eq. (2). The partial natural frequencies

FIG. 2: Sign of the secondary Bjerknes force as a function

Since thermal conduction is not taken into account in the
DNS technique [9], the damping factors are determined
by the sum of the viscous and radiative ones as [3]

where µ (= 1.137 × 10−3 kg/(m s)) and c (= 1500 m/s)
are the viscosity and the sound speed, respectively, of the
surrounding liquid. As discussed in Ref. [7], the highest
and second highest eigenfrequencies of the larger bubble
tend to vanish when the damping eﬀect is suﬃciently
strong; in the present case, those disappear completely.
The second highest and lowest eigenfrequencies of the
smaller bubble cross and vanish at a certain distance,
and only one eigenfrequency remains in the large-distance
region.

crete expressions for φ1 and φ2 are shown in Ref. [7].)
The reversal of the sign of this force takes place only
when the sign of E changes because K1 > 0 and K2 > 0
always [6, 7]. Figure 2 shows E as a function of the driv-
ing frequency. The physical parameters are the same as
those used for Fig. 1, except for the distance ﬁxed to
D = 20 µm. In this ﬁgure, we can observe reversals at
ω/ω10 ≈ 1.06 and ω/ω10 ≈ 0.72; respective reversals are

due to the highest and the second highest eigenfrequen-
cies of the smaller bubble. The lowest eigenfrequency of
the smaller bubble does not cause the reversal since the
eigenfrequency of the larger bubble is almost equivalent
to it and simultaneous phase reversal of both bubbles oc-
curs; namely, a large phase diﬀerence between the bub-
bles does not appear in the frequency region around the
lowest eigenfrequency.

ondary Bjerknes force. The bubbles’ radii and the initial
distance between their mass centers are set by using the
same values as those used for Fig. 2 [R10 = 5 µm, R20 = 9
µm, and D(time = 0) = 20 µm]. The content inside the
bubbles is assumed to be an ideal gas with a speciﬁc heat
ratio of 1.33, equilibrium density of 1.23 kg/m3, and vis-
cosity of 1.78 × 10−5 kg/(m s). The surrounding liquid
is water whose equation of state is determined by the
Tait equation with an equilibrium density and pressure
of 1000 kg/m3 and 1 atm, respectively. The viscosity of
water and the surface-tension coeﬃcient are set to the
same values as those used in Sec. II. The axisymmetric
coordinate (r×z) is selected for the computational space,
and the mass centers of the bubbles are located on the
central axis of the coordinate. The widths of the com-
putational grids [∆r and ∆z] are set as constant, being
∆r = ∆z = 0.25 µm, and the numbers of grids in the
r and z coordinates are 100 and 320, respectively. The
sound pressure, applied as the boundary condition to the
pressure, is assumed to be in a form of Pex = Pa sin ωt,
where its amplitude Pa is set to be suﬃciently low [ﬁxed
to 0.3 atm] and the driving frequency is selected from
the frequency range around the bubbles’ partial natural
frequencies.

In Fig. 3, the bubbles’ (mean) radii and positions as
functions of time are displayed. From this ﬁgure, we
know that the smaller bubble has two resonance frequen-
cies, one of which is at ω ≈ ω10/0.9 and the other is at
ω ≈ ω10/2.2. The former resonance frequency is higher
than the partial natural frequency of the smaller bub-
ble, and the latter is lower than that of the larger bub-
ble (≈ ω10/1.8). These respective resonances may be
due to the highest and the lowest eigenfrequencies of the
smaller bubble, which correspond to the natural frequen-
cies. The ﬁgure shows that the larger bubble has only
one resonance frequency being at ω ≈ ω10/2.2. Those re-
sults are, at least in a qualitative sense, consistent with
the theoretical result displayed in Fig. 1.

The sign of the interaction force changes twice in the

frequency region used. In the region between ω = ω10/0.8
and ω = ω10/0.9, being near the higher resonance fre-
quency of the smaller bubble discussed above, the attrac-
tive force turns into repulsion as the driving frequency
decreases, and, at ω ≈ ω10/1.2, the repulsive force turns
into attraction. (Also see Fig. 4 which shows D in the
cases where the deviation in D is small.) The former re-
versal is, obviously, due to the highest eigenfrequency of
the smaller bubble. The question arises as to the cause
of the latter one.

The latter reversal reveals that a kind of character-
istic frequency should exist in the frequency region be-
tween the partial natural frequencies of the bubbles. It
is evident that this characteristic frequency is not the
resonance frequency of the larger bubble, which is much
lower as discussed already. This result is in opposition to
the assumption described by Doinikov and Zavtrak [5].
This characteristic frequency may be the second high-
est eigenfrequency of the smaller bubble as predicted by
Ida [7]. (In Refs. [7, 8], it is proved that eigenfrequen-
cies other than the natural frequencies do not cause the
resonance response. This theoretical prediction is thor-
oughly reproduced in the present numerical results show-
ing that the smaller bubble does not indicate a resonance
response in this frequency region.) In order to conﬁrm
that this characteristic frequency is not that of larger
bubble, we display in Fig. 5 the R2–time and Pex–time
curves for around ω = ω10/1.2 in piles. This ﬁgure clearly
shows that the pulsation phase of the larger bubble does
not reverse in this frequency region; the bubble main-
tains its out-of-phase pulsation with the external sound

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have veriﬁed the recent theoretical
results regarding the eigenfrequencies of two interacting

5

gas bubbles and the secondary Bjerknes force [6, 7]. The
present numerical results given by the DNS technique
support the theoretical results, at least in a qualitative
sense. The use of models with higher accuracy [5, 15,
16, 17] rather than the classical coupled-oscillator model
[4, 7, 14] used for the theory may allow us to acquire
more quantitatively accurate results.

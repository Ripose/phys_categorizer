We investigate the stabilization mechanisms of the invasion front in two-dimensional drainage
displacement in porous media by using a network simulator. We focus on the process when the front
stabilizes due the viscous forces in the liquids. Especially, we study the variation of the capillary
pressure along the front. We ﬁnd that the capillary pressure diﬀerence between two diﬀerent points
along the front vary linearly as function of height separation in the direction of the displacement.
Our result is inconsistent with earlier predictions for viscous stabilization when using percolation
theory. Instead the behavior of the capillary pressure diﬀerence is found to be similar to what is
known when gravity stabilizes the front. We also discuss the ﬂuctuations in the capillary pressures
between two diﬀerent points along the front as function of injection rate. Our results are based on a
network simulator modeling two phase drainage displacement on a two-dimensional lattice of tubes.
We also compare some of our data with experimental work.

I. INTRODUCTION

Immiscible displacement of one ﬂuid by another ﬂuid in
porous media has important applications in a wide range
of diﬀerent technologies. Most often mentioned is hy-
drology and and oil recovery. From a theoretical point of
view, the displacement process is very complex and hard
to describe in detail. Especially, much attention has been
paid to the rich variety of displacement structures that
is observed. The displacement structures are found to
depend strongly on the ﬂuid properties like viscosity, in-
terfacial tension, ﬂuid ﬂow rate, and wettability [1,2,3,4].
In drainage displacement the primary process is the
displacement of a wetting ﬂuid by a nonwetting ﬂuid
in porous media. Consider a two-dimensional horizon-
tal displacement of a less viscous ﬂuid by a more viscous
ﬂuid. At high injection rates the front that develops be-
tween the invading and defending ﬂuid, is known to sta-
bilize [3]. In contrast, at extremely low injection rate the
invading ﬂuid generates a growing cluster similar to the
cluster formed by invasion percolation [5,6,7,8]. The dis-
placement is now controlled solely by the capillary pres-
sure Pc, that is the pressure diﬀerence between the two
ﬂuids across a meniscus.

In this paper we address the question of how the in-
vasion front stabilizes when no gravity forces are present
(horizontal displacement).
In particular, we will study
the temporal evolution of the ﬂuid pressures during the
displacement. To do this, we have developed a network
model that properly simulates the dynamics of capillary
pressure variations along the front as well as the viscous
pressure buildup in the ﬂuids. We report that for a wide
range of injection rates and diﬀerent ﬂuid viscosities the
capillary pressure Pc along the front, varies linearly in the
direction of the displacement. This is a surprisingly sim-

ple result and not expected due to the fractal behavior
of the front structure and the non homogeneous viscous
force ﬁeld (see below).

The eﬀect of gravity on the front when the ﬂu-
ids have diﬀerent densities has been thoroughly dis-
cussed [9,10,11,12]. It is found that gravity may stabilize
the front in slow drainage. Gravity causes a hydrostatic
pressure gradient in the ﬂuids.
If a heavy nonwetting
ﬂuid is below and displacing vertically upwards a light
wetting ﬂuid, this gradient will stabilize the front. The
strength of the hydrostatic pressure gradient is often ex-
pressed by the bond number, Bo = ∆ρga2/γ, which is
the ratio of gravity and capillary forces. Here ∆ρ de-
notes the density diﬀerence between the ﬂuids, g is the
acceleration due to gravity, a is the typical pore size, and
γ is the ﬂuid interface tension. The displacement process
has been linked to invasion percolation (IP) with a sta-
bilizing gradient [10,11,13]. In IP each site is assigned an
invasion probability f . By applying a gradient in the f ’s
proportional to −Bo the front of the invasion cluster will
stabilize. Its saturated front width ws, has been shown
to scale as

ws ∝ B−ν/(1+ν)
o

,

(1)

where ν is the correlation length exponent from percola-
tion theory (ν = 4/3 in two dimensions).

The understanding of the stabilization process when
viscous forces replace the gravity forces is more open.
In the literature the mechanisms have been related to
IP in a similar manner as the case with gravity [10,14].
However, the scenario is more complicated. Gravity is
a uniform force acting on the whole system, while the
viscous force is local and ﬂuctuates due to permeabil-
ity variations and ﬂuid trapping in the porous medium.
Percolation concepts have been applied to the displace-

ment by separating the displacement structure into two
parts. One consisting of the frontal region, and the other
consisting of the static structure behind. The frontal
region of extent ws, is assumed to behave as the perco-
lating cluster in percolation theory. Consequently, it is
assigned the permeability k ∝ w−t/ν
, where t is the con-
ductivity exponent from percolation theory. By applying
Darcy’s law and assuming that the stabilized front reach
a traveling-wave state according to Buckley-Leverett dis-
placement [15], the scaling of the front width is found to
behave as [10]

Here β is the order parameter exponent from percolation
theory, and Ca denotes the capillary number.
In the
following Ca ≡ Qµ/Σγ, where Q is the injection rate, Σ
is the cross section of the inlet, and µ is deﬁned as the
maximum viscosity of the two ﬂuids. Physically, Ca is
the ratio of viscous to capillary forces.

Wilkinson [10] was the ﬁrst to propose scaling rela-
tion (2) for three dimensional displacement. However,
we test it here in two dimensions.
In Appendix A we
present a simple method to deduce Eq. (2) by applying
percolation concepts on the frontal region.

Xu et al. [14] went further than Wilkinson and used the
percolation approach to deduce a scaling relation for the
viscous pressure drop across the front. They proposed
that the nonwetting pressure drop ∆Pnw across the front
should scale as

∆Pnw ∝ ∆ht/ν+de−1−β/ν ,

(3)

over a distance ∆h in the direction of the displacement
(see Fig. 1). Furthermore, they argued that the corre-
sponding pressure drop in the wetting phase ∆Pw, must

2

be linearly dependent on ∆h since the displaced phase
is compact. In Eq. (3) ∆h is assumed to be suﬃciently
large for scaling to be acceptable and less or equal to the
front width ws. Moreover, de is the Euclidean dimension
of the space embedded by the front. In our case de = 2.
In this paper we have calculated the capillary pressure
variations of the pore menisci along the front in drainage
simulations. Especially, we have studied the capillary
pressure diﬀerence in the direction of the displacement,
denoted by ∆Pck. Roughly, ∆Pck over a height ∆h, is
given by ∆Pck ≃ ∆Pnw − ∆Pw (Fig. 1). Let us assume
that the wetting portion to ∆Pck is small compared to
the nonwetting part. This is particularly true at low
injection rates and high viscosity contrast between the
nonwetting and wetting phase. Then from Eq. (3) we
approximate ∆Pnw ∼ ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ where κ = t/ν + d −
1−β/ν. This is indeed exactly the same result we deduce
in Appendix A in two dimensions (d = 2). By inserting
the value of the exponents in two dimensions, t = 1.30,
β = 5/36 ≃ 0.14, and ν = 4/3 ≃ 1.33, we get κ = 1.9.
Our simulation results clearly indicate that κ = 1.0 ± 0.1
which is inconstant with the scaling proposed by Xu et
al. [14].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we de-
In
scribe the network model used in the simulations.
Sec. III we present and discuss the simulations results
and in Sec. IV we compare our results with some exper-
imental data. The conclusions are drawn in Sec. V. At
the end we have put Appendix A where we deduce the
scaling relation (2).

II. NETWORK MODEL

The network model has been presented else-
where [16,17] and therefore only its main features will
be given here.

In the simulations we have constructed the porous
medium in two diﬀerent ways. In the ﬁrst way the porous
medium is represented by a square lattice of tubes ori-
ented at 45◦. The tubes are cylindrical with length
d. Each tube is assigned an average radius r which
is chosen at random in the interval [λ1d, λ2d], where
0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 ≤ 1. The randomness of the radii repre-
sents the disorder in the system.
In the following this
system will be referred to as the constant tube length
lattice.

In the second way the porous medium is constructed
upon a square lattice inclined 45◦ where the distance be-
tween each intersection in the lattice is of unit length.
Around each intersection we draw a circle of radius λ.
To avoid overlapping circles the given λ must be in the
interval 0 ≤ λ < 1/2. A node is placed at random inside
each of the circles and the nodes inside the nearest neigh-
bor circles are connected by cylindrical tubes. Thus, as
for the constant tube length lattice, four tubes meet at
each node. We let dij denote the length of the tube be-

tween the ith and jth node, and the corresponding radius
rij is deﬁned as rij = dij /2α. Here α is the aspect ratio
In the simu-
between the tube length and the radius.
lations α = 1.25, hence, the tubes are 25% longer than
they are wide. In this lattice the position of the nodes
represent the disorder in the system, and therefore we
will refer to it as the random node lattice.

While every pair of nearest neighbor nodes are sepa-
rated an equal distance in the constant tube length lat-
tice, the distance between two nearest neighbor nodes
vary in the random node lattice. Especially, the short-
est length scale, that is the minimum distance between
two neighboring nodes, is less in the random node lat-
tice. Consequently, we are able to generate more narrow
fronts at higher injection rates at the random node lat-
tice, than what is possible with the constant tube length
lattice. Therefore the random node lattice is preferred at
high injection rates where a ﬂat front is generated.

In both lattices the tubes represent the volume of both
pores and throats. There is no volume assigned to the
nodes. The liquids ﬂow from the bottom to the top of
the lattice, and we implement periodic boundary condi-
tions in the horizontal direction. The pressure diﬀerence
between the bottom row and the top row deﬁnes the pres-
sure across the lattice. Initially, the system is ﬁlled with
a wetting ﬂuid with viscosity µw. The injected ﬂuid is
nonwetting and has viscosity µnw ≥ µw. The viscosity
ratio M , is deﬁned as M ≡ µnw/µw.

The capillary pressure pc between the nonwetting and

wetting ﬂuid in a tube is given by Young-Laplace law

pc = γ

1
R1

(cid:18)

+

1
R2 (cid:19)

,

(4)

where R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature of
the interface (a meniscus) and γ is the interfacial tension.
In a cylindrical tube of radius r where R1 = R2, Eq. (4)
reduces to pc = (2γ/r) cos θ. Here θ denotes the wetting
angle between the nonwetting and wetting phases, and
in drainage θ is in the interval (0, π/2).

In the network model we treat the tubes as if they were
hourglass shaped with eﬀective radii following a smooth
function. Hence, we let the capillary pressure become a
function of the meniscus position in the tube and assume
the Young-Laplace law (4) takes the form

pc =

[1 − cos(2π x

d )] .

(5)

2γ
r

Here 0 ≤ x ≤ d is the position of the meniscus in the tube
where d is the tube length. We assume perfect wetting,
i.e. θ = 0.

By letting pc vary according to (5), we include the
eﬀect of burst dynamics into the model [16]. This is
particularly seen at low injection rates where the inva-
sion of nonwetting ﬂuid takes place in bursts accompa-
nied by sudden negative jumps in the pressure (Haines
jumps) [18,19]. The detailed modelling of the capillary

pressure costs computation time. However, it seems nec-
essary in order to properly simulate the pressure behavior
along the front.

The volume ﬂux qij through a tube from the ith to
the jth node is found from the Washburn equation for
capillary ﬂow [20]

qij = −

(∆pij − pc) .

(6)

σijkij
µij

1
d

Here kij is the permeability of the tube (r2
ij /8) and σij
is the cross section (πr2
ij ) of the tube. µij is the eﬀective
viscosity given by the sum of the volume fractions of each
ﬂuid inside the tube multiplied by their respective viscosi-
ties. The pressure drop across the tube is ∆pij = pj − pi,
where pi and pj is the nodal pressures at node i and j
respectively. The capillary pressure pc is the sum of the
capillary pressures of the menisci (given by Eq. (5)) in-
side the tube. A tube partially ﬁlled with both liquids,
is allowed to contain either one or two menisci. For a
tube without menisci pc = 0, and Eq. (6) reduces to that
describing Hagen-Poiseuille ﬂow with µij = µ1 or µ2.

No volume assigned to the nodes, giving conservation

of volume ﬂux at each node

qij = 0 .

Xj

(7)

The summation on j runs over the nearest neighbor nodes
to the ith node while i runs over all nodes that do not
belong to the top or bottom rows, that is, the internal
nodes.

Eqs. (6) and (7) constitute a set of linear equations
which are to be solved for the nodal pressures pj, with
the constraint that the pressures at the nodes belonging
to the upper and lower rows are kept ﬁxed. The set
of equations is solved by using the Conjugate Gradient
method [21].

We want to solve the pj’s for an applied constant in-
jection rate Q giving a time dependent pressure ∆P
across the lattice. To do this, we use a relation be-
tween the nodal pressures pj and ∆P which goes as
∆pij = Γij ∆P + Πij [16,17]. Here Γij is a dimension-
less quantity depending on the mobilities (kij /µij) of
the tubes and Πij is a function of the capillary pres-
sures of the menisci inside the tubes.
If no menisci in
the network are present Πij is zero. ∆P is calculated
by inserting the desired ﬂux into the functional relation
∆P = AQ + B [16,17]. Here A and B is found by in-
serting the calculated ﬂuxes Q′ and Q′′ corresponding to
the solution of Eq. (7) for two diﬀerent pressures ∆P ′
and ∆P ′′ applied across the lattice. According to [17] A
should be read as the total resistance of the system and
B is the pressure drop due to the capillary pressure of
the menisci.

Summarized, the procedure for each time step ∆t is:
(1) Solving Eqs. (6) and (7) twice for two diﬀerent
pressures ∆P ′ and ∆P ′′, applied across the lattice. This
gives us two sets of the nodal pressures pij.

3

(2) Calculate the corresponding ﬂuxes Q′ and Q′′, from

the solutions in step (1) and ﬁnd A and B.

(3) Use ∆P = AQ + B to ﬁnd the pressure ∆P across

the lattice by inserting the given injection rate Q.

(4) Calculate the nodal pressures pij due to this ∆P
by using ∆pij = Γij∆P + Πij . Note that Γij and Πij is
already known from the two solutions from step (1).

(5) The local ﬂow rate qij in each tube is computed by
using Eq. (6) and the nodal pressures pij from step (4).
(6) Calculate a time step ∆t, such every meniscus is
allowed to travel at most a maximum step length ∆xmax,
during every time step.

(7) The menisci are updated according to the found qij
and ∆t. The total time lapse is recorded before the whole
procedure is repeated for the new ﬂuid conﬁguration.

Numerical simulations show that ∆xmax must be of or-
der 0.1 to calculate the variation in the capillary pressure
when a meniscus travel through a tube.
In all simula-
tions presented here ∆xmax = 0.1, resulting in at least
ten time steps to invade one tube with nonwetting ﬂuid.
This causes the computation time to increase dramati-
cally.

Menisci that are moved out of a tube during a time step
are spread into neighbor tubes. For details about how
the menisci is moved into neighbor tubes see Refs. [16]
and [17].

We have run drainage displacement simulations at dif-
ferent injection rates to study the dependency of the front
structure on the capillary pressure variations along the
front. Due to the huge computational eﬀort, the simu-
lations have been limited to lattices of size 25 × 35 and
40×60 nodes. We have also run displacement simulations
that were initiated on clusters which were generated by
an invasion percolation algorithm. In this way, we were
able to study the capillary pressure variations along the
invasion front on lattices of size 200 × 300 nodes.

In each simulation the front between the nonwetting
invading ﬂuid and the defending wetting ﬂuid was de-
tected by running a Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm [22] on
the lattice. The typical displacement structures obtained
at diﬀerent capillary numbers on the lattices of 40 × 60
nodes, is shown in Fig. 2. The front is deﬁned as the
set of tubes that contain a front meniscus between the
nonwetting and wetting phase. At low Ca we approach
the limit of capillary ﬁngering where the invading ﬂuid
creates a rough front with trapped cluster on all sizes be-
tween the maximum front width and the tube length. At
high Ca the front stabilize and a typical compact pattern
with a ﬂat front generates.

The variation of the capillary pressure ∆Pc, between
pairs of menisci along the front was calculated. ∆Pc
was found both in the direction of the displacement de-
noted by ∆Pck, and in the orthogonal direction given as

ulations at breakthrough. The simulations were done on
the lattice of 40 × 60 nodes and M = 1. The structure of
the simulation at Ca = 3.2×10−5 shows a wide front with
trapped clusters on many length scales. The simulations at
Ca = 1.6×10−3 shows a compact pattern with a narrow front
and corresponding small trapped clusters. The black nonwet-
ting ﬂuid displaces the gray wetting ﬂuid from below.

left boundary of the lattice. Assume that hm > hn, then

The capillary pressure diﬀerence in the orthogonal di-

is held constant. Thus, in the above notation ∆Pc⊥ =

mn(0, ∆l = const.)|i.

For each simulation we also recorded the front width w.
The front width was deﬁned as the standard deviation of
the distances between all the front tubes and the average
position of the front.

The simulations were performed with parameters as
close as possible to experiments performed in [23]. In the
lattice of constant tube lengths we assigned the length d,
of all tubes equal to 1 mm and the radii r of the tubes
were randomly chosen in the interval 0.05d ≤ r ≤ d. In
the lattices with random nodes we chose the positions of
the nodes such that the length of the tubes were inside
the interval 0.2 ≤ d ≤ 1.8 mm. This gave us the radii
of the tubes, deﬁned by r = d/2α, where α = 1.25. For
both types of lattices the interfacial tension was set to
γ = 30 dyn/cm, and the ﬂuid viscosities were 0.010 P,
0.50 P or 10 P.

A. Viscosity ratio, M = 100

We have performed two series of simulations with vis-
cosity ratio M = 100, going from low to high injection
rate. In the ﬁrst series we used the constant tube length
lattice, and in the second series the simulations were done
on the random node lattice. In both series the lattice size
was 25 × 35 nodes. In Tables I and II we have listed the
injection rates and capillary numbers used in the simula-
tions done on the constant tube length lattice (Table I)
and the random node lattice (Table II). Also shown are
the recorded saturated front width and the number of
diﬀerent runs we did at each injection rate.

The capillary pressure diﬀerence in the direction of
the displacement, ∆Pck, and in the orthogonal direction,
∆Pc⊥, was recored for all simulations. The result for
∆Pck of the series performed on the constant tube length
lattice, is shown in Figs. 3 and 4.

FIG. 3. ∆Pck as function of ∆h in the direction of dis-
placement for various Ca and M = 100. At each Ca, ∆Pck is
the average of 30 diﬀerent runs and the error bars denote the
standard error of the mean.

In the logarithmic plot in Fig. 4 we have ﬁtted the
results to a straight line for Ca = 3.7×10−4 and Ca =
1.1×10−2. Assuming a power law behavior, we ﬁnd that
at Ca = 3.7×10−4, ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ where κ = 1.0. The ex-
ponent κ seems to decrease systematically with increas-
ing injection rate, and at Ca = 1.1×10−2 our best es-
timate is κ = 0.8. Similar results was found from the
simulations performed on the random node lattice. The
data points corresponding to ∆h ≤ 1 tube length is omit-
ted in the calculations of the exponent in Fig. 4. At short
distances we expect uncertainties in the result because of
the ﬁnite length of the tubes in the lattice.

In Fig. 3 we observe that ∆Pck increases more rapidly
as function of ∆h at high injection rates compared to
the results at low injection rates. At extremely low in-
jection rate we expect ∆Pck in Fig. 3 to approach zero
and become independent of ∆h. In this limit the cap-
illary pressure of the menisci along the front are equal
(capillary equilibrium). As seen from Fig. 3, we have not
performed simulations with that low injection rate. In-
stead the lowest capillary number in Fig. 3 corresponds
to the injection rate where no clear stabilization of the
front was found due to the ﬁnite size of the system.

At higher injection rates the viscous gradient stabilizes
the front. The gradient results the capillary pressure
of the menisci closest to the inlet to exceed the capil-
lary pressure of the menisci lying in the uppermost part.
Thus, the menisci closest to the inlet will easier pene-
trate a narrow tube compared to menisci further down
the stream. This will eventually stabilize the front. The
viscous pressure gradient will increase with increasing in-
jection rate, resulting in a more narrow front width. This
is seen in Tables I and II where ws was found to decrease
with increasing Ca.

In Fig. 5 we have plotted the average position hxi,
inside the tubes as function of

of the front menisci

Ca = 1.0×10−2 where the viscous pressure gradient is
strong, the menisci behind in the front is placed closer to
the middle of the tube compared to the menisci ahead.
Consequently, the capillary pressure of the menisci be-
hind is larger than the capillary pressure of the menisci
ahead and therefore tubes behind will more easily be in-
vaded. Remember that the tubes are hourglass shaped
and that the most narrow part of the tube is at x = 0.5
(see Eq. (5)). At low injection rate (Ca = 1.0×10−4)
we approach the regime of capillary equilibrium giving
almost no diﬀerence in hxi as function of h − hmin.

In Fig. 3 the value of ∆Pck at ∆h = ws, de-
noted as ∆Pck(ws), tend to increase with increasing
Ca. In gravitational stabilization ∆Pck(ws) ∝ wsBo ∼
1/(1+ν) [11]. Note that ws ∝ ξ is the correlation length

low to eliminate the viscous forces. Thus, the system
exhibits capillary equilibrium along the front and the in-
vasion of nonwetting ﬂuid occurs in a series of bursts [24].
The time step of a burst is very short compared to the
slow injection rate. Therefore, the volume of wetting ﬂuid
that is displaced when nonwetting ﬂuid enters a new pore
in a burst, must be compensated by a retraction of the
front in neighboring tubes. The front menisci will quickly
readjust back to larger radii and the capillary pressure
will decrease in a jump (Haines jumps) [18].

In viscous stabilization at high injection rate, the sys-
tem will not be in capillary equilibrium at all. Eventu-
ally, the injection rate will be high enough to prevent
the menisci to readjust in the close vicinity of a burst.
Consequently, new pores will be invaded simultaneously
everywhere along the front.

This is demonstrated in Fig. 7, where we have plotted
the capillary pressure diﬀerence in the orthogonal direc-
tion, ∆Pc⊥, for the simulations performed on the random
node lattice. ∆Pc⊥ is the absolute capillary pressure dif-
ference between menisci at same height above the inlet
but separated a horizontal distance ∆l. We interpret it
as the horizontal correlations in the capillary pressure
between menisci at same height. Recall that ∆Pc⊥ con-
tains terms like |pm
c and
pn
c denote the capillary pressure of two front menisci m
p
and n (see beginning of Sec. III). From Fig. 7 we see that
at low Ca the capillary pressure of two menisci at same
height and a distance ∆l <
∼ 7 apart, are correlated to
each other because ∆Pc⊥ depends on ∆l. Above ∆l = 7,
∆Pc⊥ approaches a constant, meaning that the capillary
pressures of the menisci do no longer interfere. At high
Ca = 1.0×10−2, we observe that the correlations are very
short. Already for ∆l > 1, ∆Pc⊥ becomes a constant and

the capillary pressures of the menisci are uncorrelated.
Thus, if we consider a narrow and a wide tube at same
height, the viscous forces are strong enough to push the
nonwetting ﬂuid through both the narrow and the wide
tube simultaneously. As a result nonwetting ﬂuid will
invade everywhere along the front. We will later refer to
this as dispersive growth of the front. In Fig. 7 only the
results of the simulations performed on the random node
lattice is shown. However, similar behavior was observed
when the constant tube length lattice was applied.

B. Viscosity ratio, M = 1

We have run a series of simulations with equal viscosi-
ties, M = 1, on the random node lattice of size 40 × 60
nodes. The diﬀerent injection rates, capillary numbers,
the measured saturated front width and the number of
runs at each injection rate, are listed in table Table III.

standard error of the mean.

M = 100, ∆Pck is expected to approach a constant when
Ca goes to zero. In Fig. 9 we have plotted the logarithm
of ∆Pck(ws) versus the logarithm of Ca. From Figs. 8
and 9 we note that already for Ca >
∼ 1×10−4, ∆Pck(ws)
reaches a plateau or even decreases and we can not see
any power law behavior. This is quite diﬀerent from what
we observed in Fig. 6 for M = 100.

To explain the diﬀerent behavior of ∆Pck(ws) when
M = 100 and M = 1, we ﬁrst look at the capillary
pressure gradient across the front and second we compare
that to ∆Pc⊥.

In Fig. 10 we have plotted the average capillary pres-
sure hPci, in the frontal region as function of the height h
relative to the bottom height of the front, hmin. hPci was
calculated by taking the average of the capillary pres-
sures of the front menisci at same height above the inlet.
In Fig. 10 the result of two diﬀerent simulations at al-
most same Ca, are shown. One corresponding to the
random node lattice of 25 × 35 nodes with M = 100 and
Ca = 1.0×10−3, and the other given by the random node
lattice of 40 × 60 nodes with M = 1 and Ca = 1.6×10−3.
If we consider the middle part of the front between the
two vertical dashed lines in Fig. 10, we observe that the
capillary pressure drop across the front, −wsdhPci/dh,
is higher for M = 100 than for M = 1, even though
the capillary numbers are almost equal. In both simula-
tions in Fig. 10, a typical narrow front with a compact
displacement structure developed. Thus, when the non-
wetting and wetting ﬂuid have equal viscosities (M = 1)
the pressure drop in the compact structure becomes al-
most equal to the pressure drop in the wetting phase.
When M = 100 however, the pressure drop in the com-
pact structure is much larger than in the wetting phase,
due to the higher viscosity of the nonwetting ﬂuid. The
capillary pressure drop across the front is given by the
diﬀerence in pressure drops between the nonwetting and

wetting phase (see for instance Fig. 1). Consequently,
−wsdhPci/dh for a given Ca must be lower when M = 1
than when M = 100, as the results in Fig. 10 shows.

Let us now study the behavior of ∆Pc⊥ when M = 1.
Physically, ∆Pc⊥ is the amplitude of the capillary pres-
sure ﬂuctuations due to the diﬀerent positions of the
menisci in the tubes at the same vertical height above
the inlet. Simulations show, that for the same Ca we
obtain almost identical results for ∆Pc⊥ when M = 100
and M = 1. Especially, the plateau where the capillary
pressures are uncorrelated has the same value. To illus-
trate this we have plotted the plateau of ∆Pc⊥ versus Ca
in a logarithmic plot in Fig. 11. The data corresponds to
the simulations performed on the random node lattices of
25 × 35 nodes and M = 100 (Table II), and the random
node lattice of 40 × 60 nodes with M = 1 (Table III). As
a guidance to the eye we have drawn a straight line in
Fig. 11, to indicate that there might be a power law be-
havior between the plateau of ∆Pc⊥ and Ca. The slope
of the line is 0.2.

From the above discussion we draw the following con-
clusion. Consider two rows of front tubes, separated a
vertical distance equal to the front width ws. When
M = 1 the capillary pressure drop between the rows is
small due to the equal ﬂuid viscosities (Fig. 10). How-
ever, the amplitudes of the capillary ﬂuctuations, ∆Pc⊥,
are the same as when M = 100 (Fig. 11). Thus, when
M = 1 the relative small capillary pressure drop between
the rows is annihilated by the capillary pressure ﬂuctua-
tions. This destroys the power law behavior of ∆Pck(ws)
in Fig. 9. When M = 100, the capillary ﬂuctuations are
too small to annihilate the larger capillary pressure drop
there, giving the increasing function ∆Pck(ws) in Fig. 6.
If we divide the capillary pressure drop, calculated in
Fig. 10, with the plateau of ∆Pc⊥, we ﬁnd that the ratio

is a factor three lower for M = 1 than for M = 100 at
Ca ≃ 1.0×10−3.

In Fig. 12 we have plotted the logarithm of ∆Pck versus
the logarithm of ∆h at Ca = 3.2×10−5 and 7.8×10−4.
For large front widths at Ca = 3.2×10−5, we estimate
κ = 1.0 ± 0.1 if we assume a scaling behavior like
∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ. At smaller distances we observe a cross
over to a slightly lower exponent, κ = 0.8 ± 0.1. For
Ca = 7.8×10−4 our best estimate is κ = 0.7 ± 0.1. In
this simulation the front width is too narrow to reach the
scaling regime where κ = 1.0. Due to the ﬁnite length of
the tubes we expect the scaling relation to change when
∆h approaches the length of the tubes. This might also
explain the systematic change in the exponent that we
found in Fig. 3. From Figs. 3 and 8 we conclude that for
suﬃcient wide fronts, ∆Pck ∝ ∆h1.0±0.1.

C. Invasion percolation cluster

In order to increase the size of the lattices we gener-
ated invasion percolation (IP) clusters with a stabilizing
gradient. The IP clusters were then loaded into our net-
work model, and the displacement process was initiated
on this structure. Using this method, we were able to
perform displacements in a short period of time on IP
clusters generated on lattices of size 200 × 300. The re-
sult of these simulations are based on the assumption
that the generated IP structures are statistically equal
to the structures that would have been obtained in a
corresponding complete displacement process.

The IP algorithm was performed on the bonds in a
square lattice with the bonds oriented at 45◦. Hence, the
bonds correspond to the tubes in our original network
model. Each bond were assign a random number fij in

the interval [0, 1] where ij denote the bond between the
ith and the jth node in the lattice. A stabilizing gradient
G, was applied on the lattice giving an occupation thresh-
old tij of every bond, tij = fij + Ghij [10,11]. Here hij
denotes the height of bond ij above the bottom row. The
occupation of bonds started at the bottom row, and new
bonds were occupied until the invasion cluster reached
the top row. There was periodic boundary conditions in
the horizontal direction. The next bond to be occupied
was deﬁned as the bond with the lowest threshold value t,
from the set of empty bonds along the invasion front. The
invasion front was found by running a Hoshen-Kopelman
algorithm on the lattice.

We ran four IP simulations with G = 0.05 and diﬀer-
ent sets of random numbers f . When the invasion front
became well developed with cluster of all sizes between
the size of the bonds and the front width, the structures
were loaded into our network model. Fig. 13 shows one
of the IP structures that was generated.

When the IP structures were loaded into our network
model, the radii rij of the tubes in the lattice were
mapped to the random numbers fij of the bonds like
rij = [λ1 + (λ2 − λ1)(1 − fij )]d. Thus, rij ∈ [λ1d, λ2d]
where as earlier, the tube length d = 1 mm, λ1 = 0.05 and
λ2 = 1.0. Note that the radii of the tubes are mapped
to 1 − fij because in the IP algorithm the next bond to
be invaded is the one with the lowest threshold value,
opposite to the network model, where the widest tubes
will be invaded ﬁrst.

In the network model the invasion of nonwetting ﬂuid
is controlled by the threshold capillary pressures pt of the
tubes. According to Eq. (5) pt = 4γ/r in the middle of
the tubes where x = d/2. In the IP model the distribu-
tion of the random numbers f , is ﬂat. Thus, when the
radii r of the tubes in the network model are mapped to
2 distribution of capillary pres-
the f ’s we obtain a 1/pt
sure thresholds. However, since there is a one to one
correspondence in the mapping from the set of f ’s to
the set of pt’s, we can assume that the IP structures are
statistically equal to similar structures that would have
been generated in a full displacement simulation. The as-

sumption provides that the displacement simulations is
performed with an appropriate injection rate Q, accord-
ing to G that was used to generate the IP structures.

After the network model was initiated by the IP struc-
tures, we ran displacement simulations on the structures
a limited number of time steps and recorded ∆Pck. The
number of time steps were chosen such that the front
menisci got suﬃcient time to adjust according to the vis-
cous pressure set up by the injection rate. For all four
structures we chose M = 100 and Q = 0.2 ml/min giv-
ing Ca = 1.8×10−4. This capillary number might be too
high compared to the front widths and capillary numbers
listed in Tables I and II. The reason why we choose a high
Ca is to minimize computation time. Simulations show
that fewer time steps and hence less CPU time are needed
to adjust the front menisci when a higher injection rate is
applied instead of a low one. Moreover, the simulations
also show that as long as the number of time steps are
chosen suﬃciently large to allow the front menisci to ad-
just, the exponent κ in ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ, is not sensitive on
the injection rate. In the present simulations the number
of time steps was 400.

The result of the simulations performed on the IP
structures is shown in Fig. 14 where we have plotted
log10(∆Pck) versus log10(∆h). As for the previous re-
sults we ﬁnd κ = 1.0 ± 0.1. The slope of the straight line
in Fig. 14 is 1.0. We have also done displacement simu-
lations on IP structures with M = 1. The result of these
simulations are similar to those we observe in Fig. 14.

IV. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

Frette et al. [23] performed two phase drainage dis-
placement experiments in a two-dimensional porous
medium with viscosity matched ﬂuids. They reported
on the stabilization of the front and measured the satu-
rated front width ws as function of capillary number. In
all our simulations except those performed on the IP clus-
ter, we calculated ws (see Tables I, II and III) According
to [10,14] ws should scales with Ca as in Eq. (2).

In Fig. 15 we have plotted ws versus Ca in a logarithmic
plot. The plot shows the experimental data of Frette
et al. and the results of our simulations on the lattice
of 40 × 60 nodes. Both in the experiments and in the
simulations viscosity matched ﬂuids where used (M = 1).
In [23], their best estimate of the exponent α when
assuming the power law behavior ws ∝ C−α
a , was α =
0.6 ± 0.2. From our simulations on the lattice of 40 ×
60 nodes we ﬁnd α = 0.3 ± 0.1, which deviates from
the result in [23], but is in agreement with simulations
reported in [14]. For our simulations performed on the
lattices of 25 × 35 nodes we also get α = 0.3 ± 0.1. A
somewhat diﬀerent process, but very interesting result,
is given by Shaw in [25]. He measured the width of the
drying front in a quasi two-dimensional porous system
0.48±0.1. Here vf is the average
and found that ws ∝ vf
front velocity. Quite recently, this has been compared to
theory in [26].

The result of Wilkinson [10] in Eq. (2) gives in two
dimension α = 0.38, which lies within the uncertainties
of our simulation results. However, we note that Fig. 15
shows a crossover in the scaling of the front width at
Ca ≃ 1.0×10−5. When Ca is above this value, ws of
both experiments and simulations seems to scale with Ca

11

to the power 0.3. Below the crossover, α = 0.6, is more
consistent with the experimental results. We will propose
to explain the crossover by the following arguments. In
the previous sections we found that ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ. The
proportionality factor in this relation has not been dis-
cussed so far, but it is reasonable that it is proportional
the injection rate Q. The injection rate sets the strength
of the viscous pressure gradient resulting in the capillary
pressure diﬀerence ∆Pck. Thus, we obtain

∆Pck ∝ Ca∆hκ ,

(8)

where our simulations show that κ = 1.0 ± 0.1.

When gravity stabilizes the front the analog to Eq. (8)
is ∆Pck ∝ Bo∆h. Thus, our simulation results indicate
that ∆Pck varies linearly with ∆h for both viscous and
gravitational stabilization. Therefore, we suggest that
when gravity is replaced by viscous forces we may simply
substitute Bo with Ca.

a

a

In fact, Eq. (8) must lead to the conclusion that there is
no diﬀerence between the evolution of the front in gravi-
tational and viscous stabilization. In both cases the pres-
sure gradient in the nonwetting ﬂuid is constant across
the width of the front. Therefore let us apply the same
percolation concepts on the viscous process that was used
in the gravitational case. At suﬃciently low injection
rate where the displacement is close to capillary equi-
librium, the percolation theory gives ∆Pck ∝ f − fc ∝
ξ−1/ν [13,10,11]. Here f is the occupation probability of
the bonds, fc is the percolation threshold of the lattice,
and ξ is the correlation length (ξ ∝ ws). By inserting
Eq. (8) for ∆Pck in the above relation, yields the power
law ws ∝ C−ν/(1+ν)
. The exponent in this relation is
exactly the same as the well known exponent in Eq. (1)
for the gravity case. In two dimensions ν = 4/3, giving
ws ∝ C−0.57
, which is close to the experimental result of
Frette et al. for low Ca in Fig. 15. We believe that the
crossover at higher Ca is due to the dispersive growth
of the front. At high injection rate the nonwetting ﬂuid
invades everywhere along the front and the displacement
is far from capillary equilibrium. Consequently, the per-
colation method where always the bond with the high-
est occupation probability is the next to be invaded, is
no longer a proper model for the displacement process.
The ﬂuctuations in the positions of the menisci inside
the tubes may occasionally cause a more narrow tube to
be invaded before a wider one. Therefore we expect an-
other scaling of ws at high Ca >
∼ 1.0×10−4 as observed
in Fig. 15. At lower Ca ≃ 1.0×10−5 the width of the
front in our simulations becomes bounded by the lattice
size and further reduction in Ca does not give rise to a
wider front. Hence, with our simulations we are not able
−0.57 regime. Note however, that
to observe the ws ∝ Ca
the power law ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ, where κ = 1.0 is found to
be valid for both low and high capillary numbers.

V. CONCLUSION

We have reported on the stabilization process of the
front width in drainage displacement going from low to
high injection rates. The stabilization process was stud-
ied by using a network simulator that properly simu-
lates the viscous and capillary pressure buildup in the
ﬂuids. We have found that the capillary pressure dif-
ference ∆Pck, along the front varies linearly with the
distance ∆h, in the direction of the displacement. We
conclude from simulations that ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ where our
best estimate is κ = 1.0 ± 0.1. This is not consis-
tent with the theory proposed in [14], where they found
κ = 1 + t/ν − β/ν ≈ 1.9 in two dimensions.

In addition to ∆Pck we have calculated the capillary
pressure ﬂuctuations along the front in the direction par-
allel to the inlet, ∆Pc⊥. Qualitatively, we have shown
that ∆Pc⊥ is a good indicator on whether the capillary
pressures of the menisci along the front are all equal (cap-
illary equilibrium) or ﬂuctuating due to the viscous force
ﬁeld. When the capillary ﬂuctuations are strong we do
not expect invasion percolation to be a proper model for
the displacement process.

We have also studied the scaling of the saturated front
width ws, as function of the capillary number Ca. As a
consequence of the result ∆Pck ∝ ∆h1.0, we have shown
−ν/(1+ν). This
that ws must scale with Ca as ws ∝ Ca
is similar to what is known in gravitational stabilization
−ν/(1+ν). We have also observed that
where ws ∝ Bo
experimental result of Frette et al. [23] is in better agree-
ment with the scaling exponent ν/(1 + ν) ≈ 0.57 than
the exponent in Eq. (2).

In Eqs. (2) and (3) t is a dynamic exponent depend-
ing on the conductivity of the lattice and with that also
on the local current distribution [22]. The exponents β
and ν, however, depend on the geometry of the structure
only. Thus, the arguments in Refs. [10,14] that lead to
Eqs. (2) and (3), combine dynamic and geometric expo-
nents. We believe that such mixing of dynamic and geo-
metric exponents, should be done with precaution for the
following reasons. Experience with the random resistor
network at the percolation threshold [27,28], shows that
other dynamic exponents may be related in an extremely
complex way. Attempts to derive them by simple argu-
ments that combine dynamic and geometric exponents,
fail. This is due to the multi-fractal structure of the cur-
rent distribution. Presumably, this is also the case here,
and for that reason the mixing of dynamic and geometric
exponents fails to describe our simulation results.

Below we show how to deduce scaling relation (2) and
ﬁnd the exponent κ in the power law ∆Pck ∝ ∆hκ. The
calculations are carried out in two dimension, however
the extension to 3 dimensions is straight forward.

Let us consider a piece of the nonwetting phase of size
∆h in the frontal region (see Fig. 1). We assume that
∆Pck vary as

∆Pck ∝ v∆hκ ,

(A1)

where v is the average ﬂuid velocity in the pores. More-
over, we assume that the front has reached a steady state
and that the structure of the front is similar to the front
of the invasion cluster obtained in invasion percolation.
This assumption provides that ∆h is suﬃciently large for
the percolation concept to apply but less than the front
width ws.

The average nonwetting pore ﬂuid velocity v, in the

the region of size ∆h, is given by Darcy’s law

A conjecture for turbulent ﬂow

(Dated: July 24, 2013)

In this paper, basing on a generalized Newtonian dynamics (GND) approach which has been pro-
posed elsewhere we present a conjecture for turbulent ﬂow. We ﬁrstly utilize the GND to reasonably
unify the two phenomenological methods recently proposed of the water movement in unsaturated
soils. Then in the same way a modiﬁed Euler equation (MEE) is yielded. Under a zero-order ap-
proximation, a simple split solution of the MEE can be obtained that shows ﬂow ﬂuids would have
a velocity ﬁeld with the power-law scaling feature (power-law ﬂuid) for the case of high Reynolds
number.

Turbulent ﬂow is one of the most bewildering phe-
nomena in nature. Ever since a hundred years, people
have initiated many theories to explain it. These the-
ories give diﬀerent phenomenological descriptions, and
some of them are in good agreement with experimental
data and provide some very useful clues for our under-
standing of true essence of turbulent ﬂow. However, up
to now, we can not employ a uniﬁed framework to de-
scribe turbulent ﬂow yet, not to mention explaining it.
we even can not give a good deﬁnition of turbulence so
that we can quantitatively determine whether turbulent
ﬂow has appeared in a ﬂuid.

In this paper, we would present a conjecture for tur-
bulent ﬂow with the generalized Newtonian dynamics
(GND) in order to better describe turbulence.

The GND describes the fractal world by means of a
fractional dimensional kinetic velocity (or mass). In the
anomalous displacement variation model (ADVM), its
one-dimensional basic dynamics equation in terms of the
Newtonian kinematics equation form can be written as
follows:

m¨x = α(

Fi)|x|1−q + κ

(1)

( ˙x)2
x

.

i
X

Here m is mass of a particle, Fi is the i-th external force
acting on the particle, q is a velocity fractal index (vﬁ)
and ˙x denotes dx/dt. The right-hand side of the gener-
alized Newtonian dynamics equation (1) can be under-
stood as the eﬀective forces acting on the particle in the
Euclidean space of the fractal environment, and the two
constants, α and κ, which are given by α = m/(qmq)
and κ = m(1 − q) respectively, are the eﬀective force
coeﬃcients. Here mq is an eﬀective mass of the parti-
cle in the fractal environment, which has a dimension of
[kg · m1−q]. The generalized Newtonian dynamics Eq.
(1) can be reduced to the Newtonian kinematics equa-
i Fi when q = 1 namely the fractal velocity
tion m¨x =
± d|x|q

dt becomes the ordinary velocity dx
dt .

It is seen that the term κ ( ˙x)

x in Eq. (1) is an additional
force which can be eliminated only when the fractal en-
vironment around the particle disappears, namely q = 1.
We call the term κ ( ˙x)
x the fractal force (FF). The FF ap-
pears in the complex fractal environment, its additional
property is similar to that of Coriolis force in a rotational
inertial system, but the origin or the practicable situation
of it is still unknown for us.

The cascade process in turbulence shows turbulent ﬂow
is a type of the fractal phenomenon. Particularly scaling
law discovered by Kolmogorov [1] and the characteristic
of the 1
f power spectrum of turbulence signal [2] can also
evidently exhibit that. Here we would assume all kinds
of turbulent ﬂow as well as process from laminar ﬂow
or convection to turbulence can be described on basis of
the fractal geometry. The fractal geometry, whose detail
contents can be reviewed in Ref.
[3], was initialized by
Mandelbrot.

Accordingly, we want to introduce the GND into tur-
bulence. We have a deﬁnition of fractal velocity ac-
cording to the anomalous displacement variation model
(ADVM):

vq =

= ±

dx′
dt

d|x|q
dt

= q|x|q−1 dx
dt

(2)

where q is the velocity fractal index (vﬁ). We assume a
particle needs a n∆t time length to “jump” a (n∆x)q dis-
placement length, then the instantaneous motion state of
the particle can be expressed by Eq. (2). Here ∆x and ∆t
is a ﬁxed displacement length and time interval respec-
tively, and n is a natural number representing the n-th
step of the particle. Because the instantaneous velocity
of the particle can be written as

vn = lim
∆t→0

(n∆x)q − [(n − 1)∆x]q
∆t

(3)

= lim
∆t→0

(n∆x)q − [(n − 1)∆x]q
∆x

∆x
∆t

;

(4)

we let ∆x=∆|x(t)|, n∆x=|x(t)|, and both ∆|x(t)| and
∆t be an arbitrary small increment; allowing for the di-
rectivity of velocity, Eq. (4) thus can be rewritten with

where Q denotes the volume ﬂow rate per unit area, k
is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, ψ is the hydraulic
pressure head and θ is the soil water content; and the
customary Richards’ equation

∂θ

(7)

can be arrived at by combining Eq. (6) and the mass
∂x = 0 with D(θ) = k(θ) dψ
∂t + ∂Q
conservation equation ∂θ
dθ .
Here D(θ) is the soil water diﬀusivity.

It is necessary to emphasize that movement of liquid
water in soils is not a diﬀusion phenomenon [4]. Con-
versely, it is a kind of macroscopic ﬂow motion which is
based on Navier-Stokes law. Phillip derived the conclu-
sion that Buckingham-Darcy law follows from the Navier-
Stokes equation with (~u·∇)~u ≃ 0: vk∇2~u = ∇φ where vk
is dynamical viscosity and φ is total potential [5]. Here
no concept of probability appears.

However, deviations from Eq. (7) [6] cause further as-
sumptions that the diﬀusivity has a dependence on dis-
tance given by |x|−βD(θ) [7] or the diﬀusivity is a time-
dependent quantity given by t2m−1D(θ) [8]. Here m is a
positive constant. We now want to unify the above two
assumptions and do not need to introduce other models
for microscopic anomalous transport.

In the GND framework, the reduced Navier-Stokes
k∇2~us = ∇φ where ~us is fractal

equation is rewritten as v′
velocity. Then the Richards’ equation is generalized as

and

(8)

(9)

respectively. Here s is the vﬁ and Ds(θ) is a fractal soil
water diﬀusivity.

Eq.

(8) and Eq.

(9) are similar to the generalized
Richards’ equations proposed in [9] and [10], respectively,
which have been shown to be valid for some experiment
data. But we can unify the two kinds of assumption
in one framework, and it seems more reasonable be-
cause previous frameworks of anomalous diﬀusion are not
appropriated for describing essentially macroscopic ﬂow
movements.

FIG. 1: Schematic representation of the anomalous displace-
ment variation model (ADVM) and the anomalous time vari-
ation model (ATVM) of anomalous motion. In the ADVM,
the particle takes the n∆t time length to anomalously move
(generally jump) the (n∆x)q displacement length along the x-
axis. In the ATVM, the particle needs the (n∆t)q time length
to anomalously walk (generally run and wait) the n∆x dis-
placement length along the x-axis.

x = ±|x| as Eq. (2) where x′ = ±|x|q which represents
the particle’s displacement in the complex environment
(which is somewhat diﬀerent from real physical displace-
ment). Similarly, we have another form of deﬁnition of
fractal velocity according to the anomalous time varia-
tion model (ATVM):

v′
q =

dx
dt′ =

dx
dtq =

1
q

t1−q dx
dt

(5)

In Fig. 1, we give a schematic description of the two
models.

But, in fact, Eq. (2) and Eq. (5) are only diﬀerent
descriptions of the same physical fact. For example, the
fact that a particle walks the (n∆x)q displacement length
within the n∆t time interval can also be stated in another
word that the particle needs (n∆t)p time interval to walk
n∆x displacement length (p 6= q). In addition, λ1−qx′
and t are real physical variables in Eq. (2) while x is only
a scaling variable, where λ denotes a characteristic length
and mλ1−q = mq; similarly x and τ 1−qt′ in Eq. (5) are
real physical variables while t is only a scaling variable,
where τ is a characteristic time and mτ 2q−2 = m′
q. Note
that x−space is changed to xq−space when a particle
is moving with time, namely ordinary scaling matching
structure of time and space is modiﬁed, but any force
(except those related to velocity) is invariant from the
ordinary environment to the fractal space.

With the help of the GND approach, we can easily
unify the two phenomenological methods recently pro-
posed of the water percolation in unsaturated soils. In
the unsaturated soil-water transport, the water ﬂux for
the horizontal one-dimensional column case follows the
Buckingham-Darcy law:

For the turbulence problem, we can obtain a modiﬁed
Euler equation (MEE) from the GNKE Eq. (1) according
to the principle of the GND:

ρ is density of a ﬂuid; −αdV ∇qp is an eﬀective pressure
acting on certain a volume element dV from surrounding
ﬂuid bodies and ~Fq is considered as an eﬀective complex
force ﬁeld acting on a volume element dV of the ﬂuid
where dFi (i = x, y, z) is a real physical force (other than
pressure) acting on a volume element dV . We notice that
~af has the same dimension as another nonlinear term
(~v · ∇)~v.

We call ∇q the fractional gradient operator, and also
we notice that ρβ ~af is exactly the fractal force on a unit
volume of ﬂuid. In addition, the coeﬃcient α with the
dimension [mq−1] can be seen as λq−1. Here λ is a char-
acteristic length of the ﬂuid. We see the MEE (10) will
will recover the ordinary Euler equation:

Here d ~F is force (other than pressure) acting on the vol-
ume element dV .

The MEE reﬂects the situation of a ﬂuid with fractal
feature, since it is derived directly from a fractal velocity
which describes the fractal state of a system. We think
the ordinary Euler equation can not play a role in de-
termining the fractal state of the ﬂuid, for the nonlinear
term (~v · ∇)~v is only a kinematic factor rather than a
dynamical factor like the term (1 − q)~af in the MEE. In
other words, when the ﬂuid becomes in a fractal state,
the ﬂuid would be acted on by a special fractal force
which appears only in the fractal situation, and the frac-
tal force can also be seen as an external energy input;
at the same time, ordinary forces will also be deformed,
but these changes can not follow naturally from the or-
dinary Euler equation. Of course, the process from a

state of a ﬂow in the fractal environment. Here a and b are
both taken 1.

laminar ﬂow or a convection current to turbulent ﬂow is
controlled by real physical parameters such as velocity of
the ﬂuid or temperature diﬀerence, these parameters of-
ten can be combined into a dimensionless number such as
the Reynolds number Re. Particularly there is a critical
Reynolds number Rec. When the Reynolds number of a
ﬂuid is above Rec, turbulence happens. That can make
us guess that the vﬁ q is a function of these dimensionless
numbers and critical dimensionless numbers such as Re
and Rec such that the fact that turbulence emerges when
Re > Rec is equal to the situation of the MEE for q > 1
(or q < 1).

The viscous term of a ﬂuid can be directly added in ~Fq
in Eq. (10), but here we would take a look at solutions
of the MEE in a range of high Reynolds number.

We study the MEE for the case of the two-dimensional
incompressible and constant ﬂow, and we consider ~Fq =
0; then Eq. (10) becomes

ties. Eq. (19) thus is simpliﬁed as a ﬁrst-order partial

whose general solution can be easily arrived at:

ψ = Φ(u) = Φ(a2|x|q−1 + b2|y|q−1) .

(21)

Here Φ is any continuous and diﬀerentiable function of
u.

For simplicity, we choose ψ as follows:

bvx − avy = (b − a)(a2|x|q−1 + b2|y|q−1) ,

(22)

such that

vx = vy = a2|x|q−1 + b2|y|q−1 .

(23)

Evidently, the velocity ﬁeld vx or vy is a parabolic dish
for diﬀerent values of q.

Therefore, under such an approximation, we obtain a
simple solution of the MEE for a two-dimensional incom-
pressible and constant ﬂow in the high Reynolds number
limit:

vi,j = ¯v2

i |xi|q−1 + ¯v2

j |xj |q−1

(24)

where vi,j denotes vi or vj .

We graph velocity ﬁeld vx given by Eq. (23) for dif-
ferent values of q in Fig. 2. Here a and b are both taken
1. It is clearly seen that manifold is broken when q < 1
and the ﬂuid velocity vx becomes inﬁnity at the position
x = 0 or y = 0. We can imagine that the ﬂuid body
could be broken up into four closed packets in each di-
mension if proper boundary conditions about (x, y, vi,j )
are given. Thus we can call the solution Eq. (23) for the
case of q < 1 a split solution for the MEE. The situation
for 1 < q < 2 is somewhat diﬀerent where four convexes
of the ﬂuid are not broken. When q > 2, velocity ﬁeld of
the ﬂuid becomes an concave parabolic dish. For q = 2
the velocity ﬁeld comprises four planes and for q = 1 a
laminar ﬂow case is recovered.

The solution reﬂects motion state of a ﬂow in the frac-
tal environment which is embodied in the MEE by both
a fractal force which can be understood as an external
nonlinear energy input and a fractional gradient opera-
tor ∇q which is similar to the Riesz fractional derivative
operator [9][10]. It is important that the fractional gradi-
ent operator will simultaneously be reduced to the ordi-
nary gradient operator when the fractal force disappears.
However, whether the MEE can describe turbulent ﬂow
or not is still an open problem.

Summarizing, the fact that the GND framework can
reasonably unify the two phenomenological methods re-
cently proposed of anomalous transport of water in un-
saturated soils and other satisfactory results of the GND
elsewhere make us conjecture that the GND constitutes
a dynamical basis of the problem of turbulence, thus a
modiﬁed Euler equation (MEE) is yielded. Under a zero-
order approximation, a simple split solution of the MEE
can be obtained, and we see that turbulent ﬂow would
have a velocity ﬁeld with the power-law scaling feature
for the case of high Reynolds number.

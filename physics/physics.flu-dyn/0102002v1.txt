Abstract: An algorithm for generating a class of closed form
solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations is suggested, with exam-
ples. Of particular interest are those exact solutions that exhibit
intermittency, tertiary Hopf bifurcations, ﬂow reversal, and hys-
teresis.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Navier-Stokes equations are notoriously diﬃcult to solve. However, from
the viewpoint of diﬀerential topology, the Navier-Stokes equations may be
viewed as a statement of cohomology: the diﬀerence between two non-exact
1-forms is exact. Abstractly, the idea is similar to the cohomology statement
of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.

Q − W = dU

For the Navier-Stokes case, deﬁne the two inexact 1-forms in terms of the
dissipative forces

(1)

(2)

WD = fD • dr =ρ{ν∇2V} • dr

and in terms of the advective forces of virtual work

WV = fV • dr =ρ{∂V/∂t + grad(V • V/2) − V × curlV} • dr

(3)

1

Then the abstract statement of cohomology, formulated as WV −WD = −dP ,
when divided by the common function, ρ, is precisely equivalent to an exterior
diﬀerential system whose coeﬃcients are the partial diﬀerential equations
deﬁned as the Navier-Stokes equations,

{∂V/∂t + grad(V • V/2) − V × curlV} − {ν∇2V} = −grad P/ρ

(4)

The cohomological constraint on the velocity ﬁeld, V, is such that the kine-
matically deﬁned vector, f,

f = fV − fD

(5)

is a vector ﬁeld that satisﬁes the Frobenius integrability theorem [1]. That
is,

f• curl f = 0 even though v• curl v 6=0.

(6)

The meaning of the Frobenius criteria is that the vector f has a representa-
tion in terms of only two independent functions of {x, y, z, t}. The Navier-
Stokes equations makes this statement obvious. One of these functions has
a gradient, gradP, in the direction of the tangent vector to f, and the other
function, ρ, is a renormalization, or better, a reparametrization factor for the
dynamical system represented by f.

These observations suggest that there must exist certain constraint rela-
tionships on the functional forms that make up the components of any solu-
tion vector ﬁeld, V, (which usually does not satisfy the Frobenius condition
in general) such that the covariant kinematic vector, f, is decomposable in
terms of at most two functions. If such a constraint equation can be found in
terms of the component functions that represent V, then its solutions may be
easier to deduce than the direct solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. For
example, the constraint relation may involve only 1 partial diﬀerential equa-
tion rather than 3. In fact such a single constraint relation can be found by
imposing a type of symmetry condition on the system, a symmetry condition
that expresses the existence of a two dimensional (functional) representation
for the vector ﬁeld, f. In this article attention will be focused on the two
spatial variables, r and z, such that the solution examples will have a certain

2

degree of cylindrical symmetry. As these solutions involve dissipative terms
with a kinematic viscosity coeﬃcient, ν, they are not necessarily equilibrium
solutions of an isolated thermodynamic system.

Closed form solutions are few in number [3], but it appears that many of
the known steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations fall into the
following class of systems: Consider a variety {x, y, z, t} with r2 = x2 + y2.
Consider three arbitrary functions, Θ(r, z) and Φ(r, z, t), and Λ(r, z) which
are deﬁned in terms of two independent variables spatial variables, (r, z), and
time. Deﬁne the ﬂow ﬁeld, V in cylindrical coordinates as,

V = Λ(r, z)uz + Θ(r, z)ur + Φ(r, z, t)uφ/r,

(7)

where uφ is a unit vector in the azimuthal direction. Note that this vec-
tor ﬁeld does not necessarily satisfy the Frobenius theorem. Note that for
simplicity, the only time dependence permitted is in the azimuthal direction.
Substitution of this format for V into the equation for f will yield a vector

equation of the form

f = α(r, z)uz + β(r, z)ur + γ(r, z, t)uφ/r.

(8)

The Pfaﬃan form W = f ◦ dr will become an expression in two variables
if the azimuthal factor γ(r, z, t) is constrained to the value zero.
In other
words, a single constraint on the functions, Θ(r, z) and Φ(r, z, t), and Λ(r, z),
deﬁned by the equation γ(r, z, t) = 0, can be used to reduce the Pfaﬃan form
to the expression

α(r, z)dz + β(r, z)dr = −dP/ρ(r, z)

(9)

The left hand side represents a Pfaﬃan form in two variables, and therefore
always admits an integrating factor. It is this idea that is used to ﬁnd new
solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. First a solution to constraint equa-
tion is determined. Then the Cartan 1-form of total work is computed. The
1-form is either exact, or can be made exact by an appropriate integrating
factor. If the 1-form is exact then the Pressure is obtained by integration.
It the 1-form is not exact a suitable integrating factor is found, and that
integrating factor represents a variable ﬂuid density, ρ. For a given choice of
integrating factor, the Pressure is again obtained by integration.

3

It is also useful to consider a rotating frame of reference deﬁned by the

equation

Ω = ωuz.

(10)

It is the choice of rotational axis that deﬁnes the cylindrical symmetry. For
such rotating systems the same technique will insure that the ﬂow ﬁeld, V,
is a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame of reference,

∂V/∂t + grad(V ◦ V/2) − V × curlV
= −gradP/ρ + ν∇2V − 2Ω × V − Ω × (Ω × r)

(11)
(12)

By direct substitution, into the Navier-Stokes equation above, of the pre-
sumed format for the velocity ﬁeld V yields an expression for γ(r, z) in terms
of the three functions Θ(r, z) and Φ(r, z), and Λ(r, z) :

γ(r, z) = {∂Φ/∂t + Λ(r, z)∂Φ/∂z + Θ(r, z)(∂Φ/∂r − 2ωr)

−ν{∂2Φ/∂z2 + ∂2Φ/∂r2 − (∂Φ/∂r)/r}.

(13)
(14)

Similar evaluations of the standard formulas of vector calculus in terms of the
assumed functional forms for the velocity ﬁeld lead to the useful expressions:

divV = ∂Θ/∂r + Θ/r + ∂Λ/∂z

(15)

curl V = {∂Φ/∂r uz − ∂Φ/∂z ur}/r + {∂Θ/∂z − ∂Λ/∂r} uφ

curl curl V = {−∂2Λ/∂r2 + ∂2Θ/∂z∂r} uz +
{−∂2Θ/∂z2 + ∂2Λ/∂z∂r} ur +
{−∂2Φ/∂z2 − ∂2Φ/∂r2 + (∂Φ/∂r/r)} uφ/r

(16)

V × curl V = Θ{∂Θ/∂z − ∂Λ/∂r} uz +
Λ{∂Λ/∂r − ∂Θ/∂z} ur +
{(1/r2) grad (Φ2/2) − {Λ∂Φ/∂z + Θ∂Φ/∂r} uφ/r

(17)

4

grad(V • V)/2 = {Θ∂Θ/∂z + Λ∂Λ/∂z + Φ(∂Φ/∂z)/r2}uz +

(18)

{Θ∂Θ/∂r + Λ∂Λ/∂r + Φ(∂Φ/∂r)/r2 − Φ2/r3}ur

grad(divV) = {∂2Θ/∂z∂r + (∂Θ/∂z)/r + ∂2Λ/∂z2}uz +

(19)

{∂Θ2/∂r2 + ∂2Λ/∂r∂z + (∂Θ/∂r)/r − Θ/r2}ur

It is remarkable that many solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations then
can be found by using the following algorithm: Choose a functional form
Φ(r, z) of interest and then deduce functions Λ(r, z) and Θ(r, z) to satisfy
the azimuthal constraint,

γ(r, z, t) = 0.

(20)

The ﬂow ﬁeld V so obtained is therefore a candidate solution to the
compressible, viscous, three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations for a system
with a density distribution, ρ and a pressure, P . The components of ﬂow ﬁeld
so determined then permit the evaluation of the coeﬃcients of the Pfaﬃan
form

W = α(r, z)dz + β(r, z)dr

(21)

If the expression is not a perfect diﬀerential, then use the standard methods
of ordinary diﬀerential equations to ﬁnd an integrating factor, ρ(r, z). The
integrating factor represents the density distribution of the resulting Navier-
Stokes solution. The Pressure follows by integration.

This method is demonstrated in the next section for the known viscous
vortex examples reported in Lugt. In addition, several new closed form exact
solutions are generated by the technique. Among these closed form solutions
are exact solutions to the Navier Stokes equations (in a rotating frame of
reference) that exhibit the bifurcation classiﬁcations for N = 3 as given by
Langford [2].
In particular, exact, non-truncated solutions are given that
represent the trans-critical Hopf bifurcation, the saddle-node Hopf bifurca-
tion, and the hysteresis Hopf bifurcation. It has been long suspect that many

5

phenomena in hydrodynamics exhibit Hopf bifurcation; now these exact so-
lutions to the Navier-Stokes equation formally justify this position, and are
especially interesting for the understanding of slightly perturbed Poiseuille
ﬂow and the onset of turbulence in a pipe.

2 EXAMPLES

In the following examples, the vector ﬁeld speciﬁed has been used to compute
the various terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. The algebra has been
simpliﬁed by use of a symbolic computation program written in the Maple
syntax. For each example, the two vector components that make up the work
one form have been evaluated and are displayed with the solution. For the
divergence free cases, the pressure function also has been computed. First,
known solutions are exhibited, and are shown to be derived from the above
technique. Then a few new solutions are exhibited.

2.1 Old solutions

2.1.1 Example 1. The Rankine Vortex

Φ(r, z) = a + (b + ω)r2, Θ = 0, Λ = 1

fV = {−(a + br2)2/r3}ur + {0}uφ/r + {0}uz

fD = {0}ur + {0}uφ/r + {0}uz

This ﬂow is a solution independent of the kinematic viscosity coeﬃcient
(the velocity ﬁeld is harmonic, as fD = 0) and therefore could be construed
as an equilibrium solution. This solution, for a and b equal to piecewise
constants, will generate the Rankine vortex.

As the ﬂow is isochoric (divV = 0), the steady pressure can be determined

by quadrature, and is given by the expression,

P = 1/2(b2r4 + 4abr2ln(r) − a2)/r2

(25)

6

(22)

(23)

(24)

2.1.2 Example 2. Diﬀusion Balancing Advection.

Φ(r, z) = a + br2+m/ν , Θ(r, z) = m/r, Λ = 1, ω = 0

(26)

fV = {−m2 − (a + br(2ν+m)/ν)2/r3}ur +

(27)

{br(2ν+m)/νm(2ν + m)/νr2}uφ/r + {0}uz

fD = {0}ur + {br(2ν+m)/ν m(2ν + m)/νr2}uφ/r + {0}uz

(28)

In this case the Laplacian of the vector ﬁeld is not zero, but the dissipative
parts exactly cancel the advective parts in the coeﬃcient of the azimuthal
ﬁeld, thereby satisfying the constraint condition. As the functions depend
only on r, the integrability (gradient) condition is satisﬁed, and these solu-
tions obey the Navier-Stokes equations for a system of constant density. The
Pressure function may be computed as

P = (−νb(4a(m + ν) + bmr(2ν+m)/ν))r(2ν+m)/ν) −
(m(ν + m)(a2 + m2))/(2m(ν + m)r2)

(29)

The solutions are cataloged in Lugt. As these solutions explicitly involve
the kinematic viscosity, ν, they cannot be equilibrium solutions to isolated
systems. Instead they represent steady state solutions, far from equilibrium.
A special case exists for m/ν = −2.

2.1.3 Example 3. Burger’s Solution, but with Helicity and Zero

Divergence.

Φ(r, z) = k(1 − e−ar2/2ν), Θ(r, z) = −ar, Λ = U + 2az, ω = 0

(30)

fV = {−(ke(−ar2/2ν) + r2a − k)(ke(−ar2/2ν) − r2a − k)/r3}ur +

{kra2/ν e(−1/2ar2/ν)}uφ/r +
{2(U + 2az)a}uz

7

fD = {0}ur + {−kra2/ν e(−1/2ar2/ν)}uφ/r + {0}uz

(31)

This solution corresponds to a modiﬁcation of Burger’s solution and ex-
hibits a 3-dimensional ﬂow (in 2-variables) in which the diﬀusion is balanced
by convection to give azimuthal cancellation. The Burgers solutions has
been modiﬁed to exhibit zero divergence. This ﬂow in a non-rotating frame
of reference exhibits a helicity.

Helicity = (U + 2az)(ka/ν)e(−1/2ar2/ν)

(32)

2.2 New Solutions

2.2.1 Example 4. A Beltrami Type Solution

Φ(r, z) = r2 cos(z/a), Θ(r, z) = r sin(z/a), Λ(r, z) = 2a cos(z/a), ω = 0
(33)

fV = {−r}ur + {0}uφ/r + {−4a cos(z/a)sin(z/a)}uz

(34)

fD = ν/a2[{−r sin(z/a)}ur + {−rcos(z/a)}uφ/r + {−2a cos(z/a)}uz]

(35)

This solution is a Beltrami-like solution, has zero divergence, and can
be made time harmonic by multiplying the velocity ﬁeld by any function of
t. The ﬂow exhibits Eckman pumping and has a superﬁcial resemblance
to a hurricane. The time independent steady ﬂow is a strictly Beltrami
(curl v = a v)with the vorticity proportional to the velocity ﬁeld.
In all
cases the helicity is given by the expression,

Helicity := (r2 + 4a2 cos(z/a)2)/a.

(36)

The kinetic energy is a/2 times the helicity, which is a times the enstrophy.
The Pressure generated from the Navier Stokes equation is given by the
expression

P = 1/2(r2 + (r2(ν/a2) − 4ν)sin(z/a) + 4a2 sin(z/a)2)

(37)

8

2.2.2 Example 5. A Saddle Node Hopf Solution

Φ(r, z) = ωr2, Θ(r, z) = r(a + bz), Λ(r, z) = U − dr2 + Bz2

(38)

The components of the advective force and dissipative force are given by

the expressions,

fV = {r(a + bz)2 + (U − dr2 + Bz2)rb}ur +

(39)

{0}uφ/r +
{−2r2(a + bz)d + 2(U − dr2 + Bz2)Bz}uz

and

fD = {0}ur + {0}uφ/r + ν{−4d + 2B]}uz

(40)

The divergence of the velocity ﬁeld is given by the expression:

(41)

(42)

div V := 2{a + (b + B)z}

The helicity of the ﬂow depends upon the rotation, ω,

Helicity : ω(+r2b + 2U − 2bz2)

but remarkably changes for ﬁnite values of r and z, depending on mean ﬂow
speed, U.

Note that when b = 0, B = 0, a = 0, the solution is equivalent to the
standard incompressible Poiseuille solution for ﬂow down a pipe. The vector
velocity ﬁeld is not harmonic, but vector Laplacian of the velocity ﬁeld is a
constant.

Without these constraints, it is remarkable that the ordinary diﬀerential
equations that represent the components of the velocity ﬁeld are in one to one
correspondence with the saddle node - Hopf bifurcation of Langford. That
is, the ODE,s representing the Langford format for the SN-Hopf are given
by the expressions:

9

dz/dt = Λ(r, z) = U − dr2 + Bz2
dr/dt = Θ(r, z) = r(a + bz)
dθ/dt = ω

(43)

.This ﬁrst order system which exhibits tertiary bifurcation is associated
with an exact solution of the Navier Stokes partial diﬀerential system in a ro-
tating frame of reference. In principle, the method also relaxes the constraint
on incompressibility, and allows a density distribution, or integrating factor,
to be computed for an exact solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes equa-
tions which can be put into correspondence with saddle node-Hopf bifurcation
process.

This example exhibits isochoric (divV = 0) ﬂow for B + b = 0, a = 0. The
steady isochoric pressure is then determined by quadrature, and is given by
the expression,

P = b(dr4/2 − (r2 − 2z2)U − bz4)/2 − ν(4d − 2b)z

(44)

where the constant U can be interpreted as the mean ﬂow down the pipe. Part
of the pressure is due to geometry, and part is due to the kinematic viscosity.
Note that the pressure is independent from the viscosity coeﬃcient when the
velocity ﬁeld is harmonic; e.g. when (2d − b) = 0. As the vector Laplacian of
the velocity ﬁeld determines the dissipation in the system, intuition would
say that the harmonic solution is some form of a limit set for the otherwise
viscous ﬂow.

2.2.3

Example 6. A Transcritical Hopf Bifurcation

Φ(r, z) = ωr2, Θ(r, z) = r(A − a + cz), Λ(r, z) = br2 + Az + Bz2

(45)

fV = {r(A − a + cz)2 + (br2 + Az + Bz2)rc}ur +

(46)

{0}uφ/r +
{2r2(A − a + cz)b + (br2 + Az + Bz2)(A + 2Bz)}uz

10

fD = {0}ur + {0}uφ/r + ν{4b + 2B}uz

(47)

This example exhibits isochoric (divV = 0) ﬂow for a = 3A/2 and B = −c.
The steady isochoric pressure is then determined by quadrature, and is given
by the expression,

P = −1/4cbr4 − 1/8A2r2 + 1/2A2z2 − Az3c + 1/2c2z4 − ν(4b − 2c)z. (48)

Again it is apparent that the pressure splits into a viscous and a non-viscous
component, and when the ﬂow is harmonic (2b − c = 0), the pressure is
independent from viscosity, and there is no dissipation in the ﬂow.

The transcritical Hopf bifurcation is represented by the Langford system

dz/dt = Λ(r, z) = br2 + Az + Bz2
dr/dt = Θ(r, z) = r(A − a + cz)
dθ/dt = ω

(49)

2.2.4

Example 7. A Hysteritic Hopf Bifurcation

Φ(r, z) = ωr2, Θ(r, z) = r(a + bz), Λ(r, z) = U − dr2 + Az + Bz3 (50)

fV = {r(a + bz)2 + (U − dr2 + Az + Az3)rb}ur +

(51)

{0}uφ/r +
{−2r2(a + bz)d + (U − dr2 + Az + Az3)(A + 3Az2)}uz

fD = {0}ur + {0}uφ/r + ν{−4d + 6Az}uz

(52)

This system has the remarkable property that the vector Laplacian changes
sign at a position z = 2d/3A down stream. There is no global way of making
this solution isochoric, for the divergence is equal to

11

divV = (A + 2a) + 2bz + 3Az2.

(53)

The hysteretic Hopf bifurcation exhibits what has been called intermit-

tency. The Langford system is

dz/dt = Λ(r, z) = U − dr2 + Az + Bz3
dr/dt = Θ(r, z) = r(a + bz)
dθ/dt = ω

(54)

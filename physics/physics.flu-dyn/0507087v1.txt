Abstract

In a ﬁrst paper we proposed a continuum model for the dynamics of systems of self
propelling particles with kinematic constraints on the velocities. The model aims to
be analogous to a discrete algorithm used in works by T. Vicsek et al. In this paper
we prove that the only types of the stationary planar solutions in the model are
either of translational or axial symmetry of the ﬂow. Within the proposed model
we diﬀerentiate between ﬁnite and inﬁnite ﬂocking behavior by the ﬁniteness of the
kinetic energy functional.

Key words: Self-propelling particles; ﬁnite-ﬂocking behavior; vortex.

1 Introduction

The dynamics of systems of particles subjected to nonpotential interactions
remains poorly understood. The absence of a Hamiltonian for such systems,
which generally are far from equilibrium, hampers applying the machinery of
statistical mechanics based on the Liouville equation. Many attempts have

been made to investigate these systems using discrete algorithms to model
this behavior. In nature there are many examples of such systems [1]. Since
the discrete algorithms are hard to describe analytically it is natural also to
consider continuum models of a hydrodynamic type. In standard hydrodynam-
ics the relation between microscopic kinetics (Boltzmann-type equations) and
Navier-Stokes equations is a standard topic of research [2]. For the systems
of interest the construction of corresponding kinetic equations based on the
speciﬁc dynamic rules and their connection with the hydrodynamics equations
seems to be unknown so far and is worth studying. One can expect that the
continuous description of the collective behavior like swarming and ﬂocking
leads to quite unusual hydrodynamics.

In our ﬁrst paper [3] we proposed a hydrodynamic model which can be con-
sidered to be the continuum analogue of the discrete dynamic automaton
proposed by Vicsek et al. [4] for a system of self propelling particles. It uses
the continuity equation

∂n(r, t)
∂t

+ div (n(r, t) v(r, t)) = 0 ,

which implies that the total number of particles

is constant. The kinetic energy of a co-moving volume

is also conserved

T = 0 .
(4)
Using Eq. (1) and Eq. (4) it can be shown that a ﬁeld ω exists such that the
Eulerian velocity, v(r, t), satisﬁes:

N =

This equation can be considered as the continuous analogue of the conservative
dynamic rule used by Vicsek et al. [4].

We proposed the following “minimal“ model for the ﬁeld of the angular velocity
ω (r, t) which is linear in spatial gradients of the ﬁelds n(r, t) or v(r, t):

K1 (r

They sample the density and the velocity around r in order to determine
ω (r, t). In the ﬁrst paper we concentrated on K1. The detailed derivation
of the above equations from the discrete models based on the automaton
proposed by Vicsek et al. [4,5] will be the subject of a future paper.

Note that the models based on Eqs. (1)-(6) allow solutions of uniform motion
in the form of a solitary packet:

n(r, t) = n0(r

v0 t)

−

(7)

with v0 independent of position and time. The contribution to ω due to K1
is zero for an arbitrary density distribution n0. The contribution due to K2
is zero for density distributions n0 which only depend on the position in the
v0 direction. In this second case it follows from the continuity equation that
n0 should be everywhere constant. The density distribution n0 should be cho-
sen such that the number of particles, and, correspondingly, the total kinetic
energy are ﬁnite. The solutions of such type also were found analytically in
[6] and observed in simulations [7]. Note that such solutions exist not only in
nonlocal case like in [6] but also for the local model which we consider below.

Within the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory on small deviation of density and
velocity ﬁelds the solitary solution given by Eq. (7) shows neutral stability;
i.e. the perturbations grows linearly for small t.

We restrict our discussion to the simple case of averaging kernels, which are
δ-functions:

Kj (r

r′) = sj δ(r

r′) ,

where

j = 1 or 2.

(8)

We will call this the local hydrodynamic model (LHM). In the ﬁrst paper,
where we only considered K1, we scaled K1 by dividing by
and the den-
sity n by multiplying with
s1
. This made it then possible to restrict the
discussion to s1 is plus or minus one. The disadvantage of this scaling pro-
cedure is that it changes the dimensionality of Kj and n. For two kernels it
becomes impractical. We note that sj is given by:

For the local model Eq.(6) reduces to:

Note that the second term on the right-hand-side of Eq. (11) corresponds to
the rotor chemotaxis force when the number density is proportional to the
attractant density introduced in [5].

In the following section we will show that the only stationary solutions for
LHM with ω ﬁeld given by Eq. (10) are either the solutions of uniform motion
(see Eq. (7)) or the radially symmetric planar solution which will be considered
in detail in the following section.

In the second section we investigate the properties of the stationary radially
symmetric solutions of the local hydrodynamic model for some special cases.
Conclusions are given in the last section.

2 Possible types of stationary states for the local hydrodynamical

model

The equations of motion to be solved are Eqs. (1) and (11). In order to ﬁnd
a class of 2D stationary solutions we consider this problem in a generalized
curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system (u, v), which can be obtained from
the Cartesian one (x, y) by some conformal transformation of the following
form:

u + iv = F (z) ,

(12)

where F (z) is an arbitrary analytical function of z = x + iy. In a curvilinear
orthogonal coordinate system the fundamental tensor has a diagonal form,
gik = giiδik, where the indices i, j are either u or v. The square of linear
element in conformal coordinates is

Now let us consider the case of ”coordinate ﬂows”, when the ﬂow is directed
along one of the families of coordinate lines u, v for example along u-coordinate
lines and is given by v = (0, vv(u, v), 0), the density distribution is n = n(u, v).
The case of a velocity ﬁeld v = vueu is equivalent (just interchange u and v).
From Eq. (23) we have:

Note that as it follows from Eq. (29)

For the integrand in Eq.(27) this implies that

vv(u, v) = vv(u).

I(u, v) = I(u).

Therefore from Eqs. (33) and (35) we can conclude that the function D(u, v),
which determines the coordinate system, depends only on one variable, D =
D (u).

In the case of conformal coordinates, deﬁned by the metrics in Eq. (13), the
Gaussian curvature of the surface is given by [9]:

For a planar ﬂows the condition K = 0 leads to the following

Using the expression for the Laplacian in the conformal representation (see
Eqs. (18)) and taking into account a fact that D = D(u) one ﬁnds for (37):

K =

∆ ln D = 0.

D = exp [c1u + c2] ,

where c1,2 are arbitrary constants. The case c1 = 0 determines a Cartesian
coordinate system, which related to a linear class of stationary ﬂow. The case
c1
= 0 determines a polar coordinate system [8], which corresponds to an
axially symmetric (or vortical) type of ﬂow.

Finally the velocity ﬁeld for the LHM, with s1

vv(u) = C exp

Thus it is proved that for the case s1
those either with planar or axial symmetry of the ﬂow.

The case s1 = 0 (the LM2) is speciﬁc because as it follows from Eqs. (23) and
(24) the velocity ﬁeld vv(u) is arbitrary while the density takes the form:

n =

−

ln D + n0 .

(40)

The statement about the symmetry of the stationary solutions for such a model
is the same as that proved above for the case s1
= 0. Note that the parameter
λ = s2/s1 can be considered as the weight factor of the rotor chemotaxis
contribution.

3 The properties of radially symmetric stationary solutions

In this section we investigate the stationary radially symmetrical solutions
for diﬀerent cases of the local hydrodynamical models. In our ﬁrst paper we
considered the s2 = 0 case, which we called the local model one (LM1). Other
models correspond to cases s1 = 0 and s1 = s2 = s which we will call the

7

6

LM2 and the LM12 respectively. We consider the ﬁnite and inﬁnite ﬂocking
stationary states for these models. It is natural to diﬀerentiate between these
two cases by the ﬁniteness of two integrals of motion - the total number of
particles Eq. (2) and the kinetic energy Eq. (4). The inﬁnite ﬂocking is asso-
ciated with N inﬁnite but ﬁnite T , while ﬁnite ﬂocking naturally corresponds
to both N and T ﬁnite. Note that in the ﬁnite ﬂocking behavior one may
consider two cases with respect to the compactness of the n(r). Compactness
means that the density has some upper cut-oﬀ beyond which it can be put
zero.

3.1 The properties of the stationary solutions of LM1

In our previous paper [3] we considered the stationary solutions in LM1 and
obtained the for velocity ﬁeld proﬁle

Here r is the radial coordinate and ϕ is the angular one, r0 is some radius,
which for vortex-like solutions plays the role of lower cut-oﬀ radius of the
vortex and determines its core.

For vortex-like solutions the constant C1 in Eq.(41) is determined by the
circulation of the core

·

The spatial character of the solution given in Eq.(41) strongly depends on the
sign of the parameter s1. The ﬁniteness of integrals of motion Eq. (2) and
Eq. (3) is guaranteed by either the fast enough decrease of the density n(r)
or its compactness (n(r) as a function has ﬁnite support).
at r

Let us consider the ﬁnite ﬂocking behavior (FFB), which is characterized by
r−α , where α > 2
both N and T ﬁnite. If at r
the total number of particles N is ﬁnite. Then at such a behavior of n(r) the
total kinetic energy is ﬁnite only if s1 < 0.

In a case s1 > 0 the condition of ﬁniteness for the kinetic energy and the total
number of particles is fulﬁlled only if n(r) has ﬁnite support. As an example

The third case which is expedient to consider is s1 = s2 = s. In that case,
according to Eq. (10), the ﬁeld ω is coupled to the number density ﬂux j = n v:

so that Eq. (11) for the velocity is

The properties of ﬁnite and inﬁnite ﬂocking behavior for this model are the

4 Conclusions

In this paper we consider the properties of the stationary 2D solutions of
the LHM proposed in [3]. We established that the only possible stationary
solutions in the model are those with translational or axial symmetry. The
cases of ﬁnite and inﬁnite ﬂocking behavior are considered for diﬀerent speciﬁc
types of the LHM. It is shown that the case s1 = 0 (LM2) is speciﬁc in a sense
that there is only one density distribution, for which many velocity proﬁles
can be realized. In general case (s1
= 0) one is free to choose axially symmetric
density distribution which the velocity proﬁle depends on (Eqs. (31) and (39)).
Note that in this respect the general case is similar to the LM1 considered
earlier.

Introduction

Impulse formations of Euler (and Navier-Stokes) equations were considered by Kuzmin [1] and
Osledets [2]. Diﬀerent impulse formulations are produced by various possible gauge transformations
(Russo and Smereka [3]). In the Kuzmin-Osledets gauge, the impulse variable q has an interesting
geometrical meaning: it describes the evolution of material surfaces; its direction is orthogonal to
the material surface element, and its length is proportional to the area of the surface element. The
extension of the Kuzmin-Osledets formulation to the compressible barotropic case was considered
in a brief way by Tur and Yanovsky [4]. In this paper, further details of this aspect are addressed
- this includes exact results and physical interpretations.

3 General Results

Theorem: q, as deﬁned in (6), satisﬁes the Kelvin-Helmholtz circulation theorem

where C is a closed material curve in the ﬂuid.

Proof: We have for a compressible barotropic ﬂuid,

q · dl = 0

v · dl = 0

which, on using (6), leads to

Proof: (15) follows immediately from equations (10) and (12).
(15) was given by Tur and Yanovsky [4], but the physical interpretation was not recognized

which we develop in the following.

to (Batchelor [5]) -

If l is a vector ﬁeld associated with an inﬁnitesimal line element of the ﬂuid, l evolves according

+ (v · ▽)]l = (l · ▽)v

which is identical to the potential vorticity equation (12). Therefore, the potential vortex lines
evolve as ﬂuid line elements.

On the other hand, if S is a vector ﬁeld associated with an oriented material surface element of

the ﬂuid, S evolves according to (Batchelor [5])-

[

∂
∂t

T
+ (v · ▽)](ρS) = −(▽v)

(ρS)

which is identical to the equation of evolution of q, namely, equation (10). Therefore, the ﬁeld lines
of q evolve as ﬂuid surface elements.
Thus, the Lagrange invariant

which may be called the potential helicity is simply physically equivalent to the mass conservation
of the ﬂuid element.2

On the other hand, the Lagrange invariant (18) also implies

q · l = const

(19)

which may be seen to be a suﬃcient condition for the validity of the circulation conservation for q
represented by (13).

Thus, the conservation laws of mass and momentum (and hence kinematics and dynamics)
undergo a certain merger at the Lagrangian level signifying some symmetry restoration taking
place there!

4 An Exact Solution

Consider the velocity ﬁeld in (r, θ, z) coordinates -

where V is a constant and

The vorticity associated with (20) is

Using (20), the mass conservation equation (1) leads to

from which

on application to (24), leads to

In this paper, Kuzmin-Osledets formulations of compressible Euler equations for the barotropic case
are considered. The kinematics and dynamics aspects apparently undergo a certain uniﬁcation at
the Lagrangian level. These symmetries break as one moves up to the Eulerian level. The Kuzmin-
Osledets formulation in the compressible case admits an exact solution that describes a density
wave on a steady irrotational ﬂow with corresponding q growing monotonically with t.

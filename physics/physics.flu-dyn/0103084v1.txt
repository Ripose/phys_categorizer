Abstract

We have developed a new experimental technique to measure the Lagrangian velocity of tracer

particles in a turbulent ﬂow. We observe that the Lagrangian velocity spectrum has an inertial

scaling range EL(ω) ∼ ω−2, in agreement with a Kolmogorov picture. Single particle velocity

increments display an intermittency that is as pronounced as that in the Eulerian framework. We

note that in the Lagrangian case, this intermittency can be described as a stochastic additive

process.

Lagrangian characteristics of ﬂuid motion are of fundamental importance in the under-

standing of transport and mixing. It is a natural approach for reacting ﬂows or pollutant

contamination problems to analyze the motion of individual ﬂuid particles. Another char-

acteristic of mixing ﬂows is their high degree of turbulence. For practical reasons, most of

the experimental work concerning high Reynolds number ﬂows has been obtained in the

Eulerian framework. Lagrangian measurements are challenging because they involve the

tracking of particle trajectories: enough time resolution, both at small and large scales, is

required to describe the turbulent ﬂuctuations. With this in mind, we have developed a new

experimental method, based on sonar techniques to obtain a measurement of single particle

velocities for times up to the ﬂow large scale turnover time [1]. Our aim in this Letter is

to compare the statistical properties of the Lagrangian velocity ﬂuctuations to well known

characteristics in the Eulerian domain, which we ﬁrst brieﬂy recall.

Eulerian velocity measurements are usually obtained as the evolution in time of the ve-

locity ﬁeld sampled at a ﬁxed point. In this framework one is interested in velocity proﬁles

in space which are derived using the Taylor hypothesis. While some issues regarding the

inﬂuence of isotropy and homogeneity are still debated [3, 4, 5], the following statistical prop-

erties of the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld are generally accepted: (i) the spectrum has an inertial
range EE(k) ∼ k−5/3, as predicted by Kolmogorov’s original K41 mean ﬁeld approach, (ii)

the probability density function (PDF) of the velocity increments ∆ur(x) = u(x + r) − u(x)

have functional forms that evolve from Gaussian at integral scales to strongly non-Gaussian

with wide tails near the dissipative scale (a phenomenon referred to as ‘intermittency’) , (iii)

this evolution can be described as being the result of a multiplicative cascade as originally

proposed by Kolmogorov and Obukhov (K62 model) and much developed since [2].

We show here that the Lagrangian velocity ﬂuctuations have similar properties, and that

the intermittency in that frame can be interpreted in terms of an additive process.

Experimentally, Lagrangian measurement have been quite scarce. Recent data have been

obtained by optical detection of particles tracks, using either Particle Tracking Velocime-

try [6] or high speed detectors [7, 8]. In the ﬁrst case the results concentrate on the particle

trajectories while in the second case a high time resolution has been used to analyze the

statistics of particle acceleration. We propose a complementary technique that gives a di-

rect access to the Lagrangian velocity across the inertial range of time scales. It is based on

the principle of a continuous sonar. A small (2mm×2mm) emitter continuously insoniﬁes

2

the ﬂow with a pure sine wave, at frequency f0 = 2.5 MHz (in water). The moving parti-

cle backscatters the ultrasound towards an array of receiving transducers, with a Doppler

frequency shift related to the velocity of the particle:

2π∆f = q.v .

(1)

The scattering wavevector q is equal to the diﬀerence between the incident and scattered

directions. A numerical demodulation of the time evolution of the Doppler shift gives the

component of the particle velocity along the scattering wavevector q. It is performed using

a high resolution parametric method which relies on an Approximated Maximum Likelihood

scheme coupled with a generalized Kalman ﬁlter [1]. The study reported here is made with

a single array of transducers so that only one Lagrangian velocity component is measured.

The turbulent ﬂow is produced in the gap between counter-rotating discs [9, 10]. This

setup has the advantage to generate a strong turbulence in a compact region of space, with

no mean advection. In this way, particles can be tracked during times comparable to the

large eddy turnover time. Smooth discs of radius R = 9.5 cm are used to set water into

motion inside a cylindrical vessel of height H = 18 cm. In the measurement reported here,

the power input is ǫ ∼ 13 W/kg. The integral Reynolds number is Re = R2Ω/ν = 1.75 105,
where Ω = 1/T is the rotation frequency of the discs (17.5 Hz), and ν = 10−6 m2/s is

the kinematic viscosity of water. The turbulent Reynolds number is computed using the

measured rms amplitude of velocity ﬂuctuations (urms = 0.32 m/s) and an estimate of

the Taylor microscale (λ =

15νu2

rms/ǫ = 350 µm); we obtain Rλ = 110. This value is

q
consistent with earlier studies in the same geometry [11].

The ﬂow is seeded with a small number of neutrally buoyant (density 1.06) polystyrene

spheres with diameter d = 500 µm . It is expected that the particles follow the ﬂuid motion

up to characteristic times of the order of the turbulence eddy turnover time, at a scale
corresponding to their diameter, i.e. τmin ∼ d/ud ∼ ǫ−1/3d2/3, using standard Kolmogorov

phenomenology. For beads of diameter 500 µm, one estimates τmin ∼ 3 ms. This value is

within the resolution of the demodulation algorithm, so that both the time and space scales

of the measurement cover the inertial range of the turbulent motion.

One of the ﬁrst quantity of interest is the Lagrangian velocity auto-correlation function:

ρL
v (τ ) =

hv(t)v(t + τ )it
hv2i

.

(2)

We observe – Fig.1a – that it has a slow decrease which can be modeled by an exponential
function ρv(τ ) ∝ e−τ /TL, in the range t/T ∈ [0.1, 2]. The characteristic decorrelation time TL

is of the order of the integral time scale (the ﬁt in Fig.1a yields TL = 54 ms while T = 57 ms).

This observation is in agreement with numerical simulations [12, 13].

the solid line is a power law ω−2 behavior.

The corresponding Lagrangian velocity power spectrum EL(ω) is plotted in Fig.1b. One
observes a range of frequencies consistent with a power law scaling EL(ω) ∝ ω−2. This is in

agreement with a Kolmogorov K41 picture in which the spectral density at a frequency ω is a

dimensional function of ω and ǫ: EL(ω) ∝ ǫ ω−2. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that

it is directly observed experimentally although it has been reported in DNS by Yeung [14].

We note that the ‘inertial range’ of scales extends for the entire range of frequencies where

the velocity of the particle is expected to correctly reproduce the Lagrangian velocity of ﬂuid

elements: at high frequency, the observed cut-oﬀ may be due to particle inertia, whereas at

low frequency the measurement is limited to the longest time that particles remain in the

detection zone (about 4T ).

We now consider the Lagrangian velocity increments ∆vτ = v(t+τ )−v(t). We emphasize

spectrum gives the variance of h∆v2

that these are time increments, and not space increments as in the Eulerian studies. The
τ i; the scaling region EL(ω) ∝ ω−2 is equivalent to
τ i ∝ τ . As usual for ﬂows with Rλ less than about 500, the range of scale motion is

with the increment’s width; the inset in Fig.2 shows h∆v2

increment’s width: they are almost Gaussian at integral time scales and exhibit wide tails

h∆v4

at small scales. One measure of that evolution is given by the ﬂatness factor F (τ ) =
τ i2; in our case F varies from 16 at smallest time lag to 3.5 for τ ∼ T . In this
respect, the intermittency is as developed in the Lagrangian frame as it is in the Eulerian

τ i/h∆v2

one [15].

More generally, one can choose to describe the PDFs evolution by the behavior of their

moments (or ‘structure functions’). A consequence of the change of shape of the PDFs

with scale is that their moments, as the ﬂatness factor above, vary with scale. One way to

compensate for the lack of a true inertial range is to use one structure function as a reference

and to study the evolution of the others relative to that reference (ESS ansatz [16]). In the

spirit of numerous studies in the Eulerian frame, we use the second order structure function

as a reference; indeed, the dimensional Kolmogorov-like argument yields:

h∆v2

τ i = C L ǫ τ .

(3)

This expression shows that the second order structure function is not aﬀected by spatial or

temporal inhomogeneities of the dissipation ǫ. It is the analogue of the third order structure

function in the Eulerian domain. In that respect, C L is expected to be a universal constant,

although there is no known equivalent of the K´arm´an-Howarth relationship in Lagrangian

coordinates.

The relative scaling of the structure functions is evidenced in Fig.4, where they are

plotted up to order 4 (higher orders would require more statistics to converge than currently

available). We observe that they follow a relative scaling law, i.e.

The scaling domain extends from τ /T ∼ 0.02 to τ /T ∼ 1.3, a wider range than the scaling

domain detected in the spectrum (hence the name ‘Extended Self Similar’ range) . The

relative exponents are ξL

4 = 1.64. These Lagrangian exponents follow a
sequence close to, but slightly more intermittent than the corresponding Eulerian quantity.

In the Eulerian context, the ESS property has been regarded as the sign of inﬁnite

divisibility for the multiplicative cascade underlying the ﬂuctuations of dissipation [18]. We

propose that in the Lagrangian framework, the intermittency of the increments result from

an additive process. Indeed, the increment at time lag τ can be written as:

∆vτ (t) =

t+τ

a(t′)dt′

,

t
Z

(5)

where a(t) is the Lagrangian acceleration. It is known that its auto-correlation time is quite

small, of the order of τη [7, 8, 12, 13]. Thus one could view the velocity increment at time

lag τ ≫ τη as resulting from a sum of uncorrelated contributions. In this case the PDF at

time lag τ would results from successive convolutions of the PDF at a time interval equal

to a few units of τη. The validity of this assumption can be checked by computing the

This aﬃne behavior is indeed observed in Fig.5 for the second and fourth cumulants. We

note that when the cumulants of the absolute values are computed, the range of linearity is

extended to the entire range where ESS is veriﬁed. The additive process is not a completely

uncorrelated one because the number of convolution steps n(τ ) is not a simple linear function

of τ ; its shape is given by C L

2 – equal to the second order structure function, shown in Fig.2.

In conclusion, we have observed experimentally that there is much resemblance between

the Eulerian velocity and the Lagrangian velocity.

In both case the power spectra obey

scaling laws that are given by Kolmogorov similarity arguments. Also, the velocity incre-

ments are intermittent, but one consequence of our observations is that the intermittency

of the Lagrangian (1-point) velocity increments can be described by an additive process.

This raises several questions which may deserve further investigations:

(i) the additive

process results from the statistical properties of the Lagrangian acceleration. Could some

of its statistical characteristics be directly derived from the Navier-Stokes equation? What

are the relative contributions of the pressure and viscous terms? (ii) what is the behavior

of this additive process in the limit of inﬁnite Reynolds numbers?

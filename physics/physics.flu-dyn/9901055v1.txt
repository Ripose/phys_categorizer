Vortex shedding in a model of superﬂow

The present article represents part of the PhD. dissertation by C. Josserand1. We discuss

the nucleation of quantized vortices in the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (NLS) for a ﬂow

around a disk in two spatial dimensions. It appears that the vortices are nucleated when

the ﬂow becomes locally (at the edge of the disk) supersonic. A detailed study of the phase

equation for the complex ﬁeld ψ gives an Euler–Tricomi type equation for the stationary

solutions below threshold. This equation is closely related to the one known in shock wave

dynamics for gas. Then using solvability condition, we extract a time–dependent scenario

for the evolution of the amplitude of the solution, which we, ﬁnally, relate to a known

family solution of NLS which gives rise to a vortex nucleation. We also give a ﬁrst order

correction at the Landau velocity of nucleation, taking into account the geometry of the

ﬂow.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of superﬂuids at zero temperature can be modelled by the Gross-Pitaevskiˇı

equation [2]. This is a partial diﬀerential equation for a complex valued scalar ﬁeld ψ(x, t)

with dependence on the position in space, x and on time t. At zero temperature, there is

no formal damping term in the equation; it is reversible in time (after complex conjugation)

and has even a Lagrangian structure. Although many of properties are well–known and have

been studied quite extensively, we shall ﬁrst review some of them. This Gross-Pitaevskiˇı

equation can be seen as a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation, and so shares many properties

of the linear Schr¨odinger equation. With periodic boundary conditions, it has an uniform

ground state minimizing the energy, the corresponding solution ψ(x, t) depends periodically

on time through a simple exponential factor. As the Gross-Pitaevskiˇı equation is Galilean

invariant, it is easy to construct a solution representing an uniform ﬂow by boosting the

rest state to a speciﬁed speed. With the same model, it is also possible to look at more

complicated situations, as ﬂows around obstacles. Two of the authors [3,4] have studied over

the last years a 2D ﬂow around a circular disk (among others), that is the solution of the

Gross–Pitaevskiˇı equation with a given uniform and constant ﬂow speed and mass density at

2

inﬁnity, with a boundary condition on the surface of the disk. One striking observation has

been that beyond a certain critical speed, the ﬂow around the disk becomes time dependent,

because vortices are emitted from the disk surface as shown on ﬁgure (1).

In Ref. [3] it was shown that the release of vortices from the boundary of the disk is

a consequence of a transition from a locally subsonic to supersonic ﬂow. In ordinary ﬂuid

mechanics, this would lead to the formation of a shock wave inside the so–called supersonic

bubble. Nothing resembling this is possible in the Gross–Pitaevskiˇı equation, because of the

lack of built–in irreversibility, something that is necessary to balance nonlinearities inside

the shock wave. As argued in Ref. [3], in the present model, the formation of shock waves

is replaced –albeit in a rather loose sense– by the nucleation of vortices with a quantized

circulation. In fact, these vortices are topological defects solutions of the Gross–Pitaevskiˇı

equation. In two space dimensions they are points where the complex ﬁeld ψ(x, t) vanishes,

making a

2π phase jump when one turns around the defect. These vortices are emitted

when the local velocity becomes larger than the critical velocity making the ﬂow locally

±

supersonic1.

The present work is devoted to study this transition. This is a rather intricate question,

as anyone who looked at the paragraph

118,

§

on ﬂuid mechanics [6] knows well: one has to solve locally the Euler–Tricomi equation for

the velocity potential, that can be done in terms of the Airy function. In the present case

there is a further complication with respect to Landau’s analysis, which comes from the

boundary conditions imposed on the disk, see

126 of Ref. [6]. Let us outline the principles
§

of our analysis; we are dealing with a problem, with two small parameters: the ratio of

the microscopic intrinsic length to the disk radius, and the relative shift of the velocity

1 The present problem has been studied in the one dimension case by Hakim [5] who has shown

that the release of vortices is replaced by a periodic nucleation of one dimensional solitons.

near the pole of the disk to the critical value, a parameter called ǫ.2 Far from the disk

boundary, in terms of the microscopic distance, the usual hydrodynamic assumption holds:

the quantum pressure term can be neglected, and one obtains an unique, nonlinear equation

for the velocity potential3. This equation can be solved by expansion, by assuming that at

the dominant order the surface of the disk is ﬂat. In this limit, the hydrodynamic boundary

conditions are satisﬁed with an uniform tangent velocity ﬁeld. Corrections have to be added

to this velocity ﬁeld in order to take into account the curvature of the disk boundary. The

ﬁrst correction is trivial, and only the second one is crucial for the analysis.

The second order corrections (for the velocity potential) is the solution of the Euler–

Tricomi equation, with speciﬁc boundary condition. It happens that the small parameter

ǫ enters into this Euler–Tricomi equation plus the boundary conditions problem in such a

way that it can be factored out by rescalings. Moreover, for ǫ negative, that is for velocities

slightly less than the critical speed, the velocity potential at this approximation is multi-

valued, but only in its extension inside the disk, which is a non–physical part of the ﬂow.

At ǫ =0 there is a transition, and the boundary of the region where the velocity potential

becomes multivalued enters the physical space, so that the solution of Euler–Tricomi equa-

tion cannot be considered as physically acceptable in this range of parameters. In ordinary

viscous ﬂuids, this multivaluedness would signal the formation of a shock wave. As said

before, no such a thing exists in the present model of superﬂuid. Accordingly, the shock

wave is replaced by a vortex, that is by adding to the ﬂow ﬁeld in the slightly supersonic

region the ﬂow ﬁeld coming from a localized vortex close to the boundary. Taking in account

all the nonlinear terms and the time dependent dynamics on the phase equation, we show

that this lack of stationarity appears as the result of a saddle–node bifurcation, as suggested

2ǫ is also proportional to the diﬀerence between the actual Mach number and its critical value.

3In this hydrodynamical limit, the microscopic length scale does not appear, and there is only

one small parameter, ǫ.

4

by two of us some ago [4]. We argue also that the critical velocity behaves as

transonic region, being ξ0 the healing length of NLS and R the radius of the disk; this is

because the quantum pressure stabilizes the ﬂow above the transonic transition for such a

range of velocity. We claim that this saddle–node bifurcation, giving rise to time–dependent

dynamic corresponds to vortex emission; for that, it remains to match this outer velocity

potential, solution of the Euler–Tricomi equation with an inner solution, close to the disk

ξ0
R above the

q

boundary with a vortex.

As one might expect from this rather lengthy introduction, it is a rather uneasy job to

put together all this picture, particularly because it depends on properties of solutions the

Euler–Tricomi equation that are not obvious.

In section II, we shall present the general

problem in its explicit form, that is the form of the equations as well as the boundary

conditions and the relevant facts about the hydrodynamic limit. We ﬁnally (section III)

obtain a nonlinear equation for an additional phase which can be decomposed as the usual

Euler–Tricomi equation plus nonlinear terms that will be treated as perturbations. In section

IV, we study some properties of the Euler–Tricomi equation, particularly we point out the

multivaluedness solutions of such an equation.

In section V, we solve the Euler–Tricomi

equation (including the quantum pressure term) using a Fourier transform along the x

axis

−

ﬁrst and ﬁnding the solution in term of the Airy function. This gives a ﬁrst correction to

the critical velocity coming from the interplay between supersonic ﬂow and regularisation

due to the quantum pressure. Then, in section VI, we are able to compute solvability

conditions around this critical value of ǫ that lead to time dependent amplitude equation.

These amplitude equations describe a saddle–node bifurcation. In conclusion, in section VII,

we try to match this phase approach, which formally cannot describe vortices in NLS, with

the release of vortices observed in simulation using the full nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.

is among other properties conservative and Hamiltonian. The ground state in a periodic

Writing ψ = ρ1/2eiφ, we obtain two “real” hydrodynamical ﬁelds, ρ and φ representing

negligible for large scale ﬂows, that is for ﬂows with a space scale much larger than the

intrinsic microscopic length, ξ0. When this quantum pressure is neglected, the equation

for φ is the equivalent of Bernoulli’s equation for a compressible ﬂuid, with an equation of

state for the pressure (p): p = 1

2ρ2. For a stationary ﬂow, ∂tφ is a constant, deﬁned by

the conditions at inﬁnity. Therefore, the mass density ρ can be computed everywhere as a

function of v, the modulus of the velocity from this Bernoulli equation.

¿From equations (2) and (3), we obtain the equations for the stationary ﬂow around a

disk (of radius R, much bigger than any intrinsic length scale ξ0) with a velocity at inﬁnity

Rewriting the equation (4) in the frame reference deﬁned by the pole of the disk as the

∂v(ρ(v)v)∂xxφ + ρ(v)∂yyφ = 0,

(8)

where x is the local coordinate tangent to the main ﬂow, and y the orthogonal one. At

low velocities this second order partial diﬀerential equation is elliptic. It is also possible to

show, via an hodograph transformation, that the maximum local speed for a ﬂow around

an obstacle, occurs on the boundary of the obstacle. This is in some sense a nonlinear (but

still elliptic) generalization of the min–max theorem by Riemann and Liouville. Equation

(2) becomes hyperbolic beyond a critical velocity. This happens when ∂v(ρ(v)v) vanishes4,

that is when the mass current takes its largest possible value for some condition at inﬁnite.

. When v

increases the property of ellipticity of equation (2)

is broken ﬁrst at the pole of the disk, leading to the nucleation of two vortices, one at each

pole. As time goes on these vortices are convected downstream by the mean ﬂow. These

vortices, once released, induce as well a counterﬂow because of the circulation condition

and this counterﬂow reduces the velocity on the surface of the disk. This brings back

the local velocity at the pole of the disk below the critical speed, and restores there the

ellipticity of the equation for the velocity potential. But the vortex is pulled farther and

farther downstream, and the counter streaming eﬀect diminishes, till the velocity at the pole

reaches eventually the critical value, the conditions at inﬁnity being kept constant; then new

vortices are emitted, etc. This describes a more or less periodic release of vortices from the

obstacle [3]. We shall study in this article the process of nucleation, namely the way in

which a vortex is emitted from the boundary when the local velocity changes slowly from

value of the speed with the present equation of state (relation between pressure and density).

the longwave asymptotics (distances larger than ξ0).

Suppose that the local velocity at the pole of the disk, v0, is close from vc; taking this point

number is exactly one at y = ǫ R

M . In this equation we have neglected the nonlinear term

∂xϕ∂xxϕ besides y∂xxϕ in (12); on the other hand the border of the obstacle has been taken

at y = 0. (The curvature of the obstacle brings a correction to the boundary condition for

the dominant order solution, that transforms itself to an extra term in the partial diﬀerential

equation for the perturbation with a ﬂat boundary ϕ.) This assumption is consistent to the

satisﬁes equation (12) with the (13) boundary conditions.

At this point, one can iterate the linear Euler–Tricomi equation by the same procedure,

that is by considering how φ0 modiﬁes the true boundary condition and then we compute

the next term φ1, and so on. It is then possible to ﬁnd a polynomial expansion satisfying the

full boundary condition. However, the convergence of this expansion is not obvious. This is

not an objection in principle because we are looking only local solutions, however we have

in mind an outer asymptotics which will mtach with a vortex kind solution (see section VII.

IV. SPECIAL SOLUTIONS OF THE EULER–TRICOMI EQUATION

Let us ﬁrst make an “aparte” by looking at some special solutions of equation (12)

that might give some idea of what arises when crossing the critical velocity, that is at the

transonic transition.

This multivaluation of the real roots of the cubic equation (15) means that it is not

possible, generally, to follow continuously a root of (15) along a closed path around the

origin (see ﬁgure (2)). More precisely, such solution will admit a discontinuity in the region

inside the semi–cubic. Unless one can regularize the discontinuity which arise along the

region multivalued (in the same sense that we have to regularize the over turning of waves

dynamics, solutions of nonlinear and non dispersive wave equations), there is no hope of

having a stationary solution of our problem except if the discontinuity gap is 2π. In this

case (jump of 2π of the phase), we will see that even if both the quantum pressure and the

10

limited transonic region have a tendency to restore the smoothness of the solution, there is

a critical velocity above which there is no more possibility of having stationary solutions.

The way we will treat the equation will hide the multivalued property that we pointed out

because we will look on regular stationary solutions (which exist as well as no discontinuity

appears), so that the discontinuities will be solved via the general time dependent nonlinear

problem.

A general solution arises whenever one consider a continuous superposition in the neutral

translation mode of the above solution (15):

equivalent after a change of variable to the integral expresion in

118 of [6]. This general
§

expression is valid only for y > ǫ R

M (as well as the roots of the polynomial (15)) where such

a change of variable remains well deﬁned.

Before ﬁnish this section, let us mention, that another family of solution appears when

one takes the Fourier transform of the x variable. Then one has that

φν(x, y) = Φ(y)eiνx,

with Φ(y) is the Airy function, the detailed analysis of this kind ok solution is elaborated

below in a more general way.

V. REGULARIZATION OF THE SHOCK SOLUTIONS OF THE

EULER–TRICOMI EQUATION BY THE QUANTUM PRESSURE.

As soon as the solutions of the Euler–Tricomi equation appears to be sharper and sharper

that the quantum pressure term in the Bernoulli equation (3) is no longuer negligible because

it involves higher order derivatives. From the full Bernoulli equation one gets the value of ρ

by an implicit relation (we shall consider here also the role of non stationary dependence of

phase and density in order to capture the full short wavelength dynamics):

We have kept in this equation only the most important term of each contribution. The

quantum pressure term, ξ2

0∂x4ϕ should be multiplied by a number that we have taken to one

by simplicity.

The way this equation (16) is written is dictated by our method of resolution: the left

hand side will be in fact treated as the main equation, linear and homogeneous, while the

right hand side corresponding to perturbations which will be incorporated terms by terms.

As said before the boundary conditions are taken homogeneous:

∂yϕ = 0

at

y = 0.

Let us study the regularisation of the solution above the threshold, ﬁrst by adding the

quantum pressure then by considering cross terms involving ϕ and φ0; at these points the

analysis remains linear so that we will just be able to look to homogeneous solutions of our

problem, without solving for the amplitude; ﬁnally we will focus on the global nonlinear

problem which allows to calculate amplitude equations and leads to the study of the time–

dependent evolution.

First we look at the left hand side of equation (16), taking the right hand side as zero.

The boundary conditions are ∂yϕ = 0 at y = 0, so that one can expand the solution as

a linear superposition of functions. The equation can be solved as the Euler–Tricomi one,

using the Airy function.

VI. AMPLITUDE EQUATION FOR THE SADDLE–NODE BIFURCATION

of (16) for ǫ

velocities. As we have conducted our calculations, starting from stationary solution for low

velocity and then adding the nonlinear dynamics step by step, this second branch for high

velocity is irrelevant in our problem. As shown on ﬁgure (4), for ǫ < ǫt there are two roots of

the stationary equation, roots that greather for ǫ = ǫt, whereas there is no more roots for ǫ

greater than ǫt, giving rise to a saddle–node bifurcation. The linear stability analysis of the

stationary solutions Z

one branch is stable (Z

as in ordinary saddle–node bifurcations. However, because of to the oscillatory term iωzt,

when approaching the bifurcation, both solutions are stable. This happens in the range of

The resulting phase diagram of the bifurcation has been plotted on ﬁgure (5). We argue

that this saddle-node bifurcation gives a consistant scenario of the vortex nucleation seen

in ﬁgure (1). They appear as a consequence of the disappearence of stationnary solutions

on the phase dynamic approch. The vortex diminishes the local velocity so that the ﬂow

comes back to a description valid for ǫ < ǫt and when the vortex is far enough, because of

the advection due to the mean velocity, ǫ pass again through the transition and we got a

periodic vortex-nucleation process. The saddle–node bifurcation appears in our case to be

richer because close to the transition both stationnary solutions are stable. This result is in

a good agreement with numerical solution by Huepe and Brachet [8].

VII. BREAKDOWN OF THE PHASE DESCRIPTION, THE APPEARANCE OF

VORTEX MOTION, CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER MISCELLANEOUS

We have in the former section reviewed the phase description, that explains the dis-

appearence of any stationary solution for the ﬂow problem. This is the ﬁrst step toward

the nucleation of a vortex. Brieﬂy, one can retain that this periodic behavior appears as

a saddle–node bifurcation where two branches of stationnary solutions collapse giving rise

for larger velocities to non stationnary solution at all. The numerous critical parameters

we have mentionned might be simpliﬁed if one see that as R

ξ0, we have ǫt ∼

ǫ′c ∼

ǫc.

≫

This allows to claim that the critical velocity for vortex nucleation vv reads at ﬁrst order

correction of the critical speed:

where vc is the Landau critical velocity.

Finally, it remains to match the vortex nucleation as a process being part of the same

evolution of the dynamical saddle–node bifurcation. For simplicity we will consider the

amplitude equation (20) where we have dropped the ﬁrst order time derivative, a term much

smaller than the other ones as one approaches the time when nucleation occurs (see the

scaling below):

¨Z(t) = Z 2(t) + µ

where µ is related to ǫ

A kind of Euler–Tricomi equation, interesting by itself. One note that, if the rate of acceleration

at inﬁnity ˙ǫ is larger than M v0/R, the nucleation process is caused by a dynamical instability not

by a sonic transition as is described in this article.

18

It typically gives the two stationnary solutions W =

1 for large T and it can be solved

±

in terms of Weierstrass function for large T [9]. Equation (21) is known for giving ﬁnite–

time singularities which shows that the slowly varying approximation of the phase dynamics

breaks at some point.

In addition, one can notice that Z is related to the velocity of

the ﬂuid in the moving frame (of velocity v0). Then, one expect to relate the amplitude

Z to a order parameter which parametrizes a continuous family of solutions of the full

nonlinear Sch¨odinger equation (1). Jones and Roberts [10] found the kind of solution that

we are interested, in two and three spatial dimensions, consisting in axisymmetric solitary

structures. The solution proposed is

φ =

(22)

m being a constant and U the free parameter characterizing the whole family of solutions.

Whenever the parameter (a velocity) U of these solutions is close to the unity (the sound

speed) one identiﬁes the relative speed U

1 (via a change of variable) with the true order

parameter α&β of the saddle–node bifurcation.

−

On the other hand as U goes to zero one matches the solution (22) with a pair of moving

vortices, one with negative topological charge located in (x = 0, y = a) while the other is an

image one inside the disk (x = 0, y

One relates very easily the distance a in (23) with the speed U in (22) by U = 1

So in the dynamical context a satisfy formally the same equation than the quantity z of

(21) or α of (19), when the time dependant solution evolves (after crossing the saddle–node

bifurcation), a vortex appears as α increases, the second vortex of the pair being formally

inside the disk in other to preserve the boundary condition.

Finally, it is of a general interest to note that the shallow water equations have exactly

the same shape that the set (2,3) in the case of potential ﬂuid motion (see [6]). In fact the

shallow water equations are

∂th =

(hv);

−∇ ·

∂tv + v

· ∇

After imposing a vortexless ﬂow: rot v = 0, i.e. v =

φ, and neglecting the quantum

∇

pressure term in (3), one identiﬁes the height of ﬂuid h with the superﬂuid density ρ, and

the potential ﬂuid velocity with the phase of the condensate wave function. It is possible to

get a short scale term in the shallow water equations by adding a capillary term, therefore

it exist a complete analogy with the analysis developed in extenso in this article. Perhaps a

transonic transition with the predicted scenario is observable in mercury where the kinematic

viscosity is very low. However, the ﬁnal state will be diﬀerent because the deep signiﬁcance

of the phase of the wave function ψ does not extend the existence of quantized circulation

vortices for the case of surface waves, where as it is well known the circulation takes any

value.

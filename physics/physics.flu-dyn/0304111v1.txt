Abstract

The inﬂuence of the small scale “cellular” structure of premixed ﬂames on their evolution at

larger scales is investigated. A procedure of the space-time averaging of the ﬂow variables over

ﬂame cells is introduced. It is proved that to the leading order in the ﬂame front thickness, the form

of dynamical equations for the averaged gas velocity and pressure, as well as of jump conditions for

these quantities at the ﬂame front, is the same as in the case of a zero-thickness ﬂame propagating in

an ideal ﬂuid at constant velocity with respect to the fuel, equal to the adiabatic velocity of a plane

ﬂame times a factor describing increase of the ﬂame front length due to the local front wrinkling.

As an application, the large scale evolution of a ﬂame in the gravitational ﬁeld is investigated.

A weakly nonlinear non-stationary equation for the averaged ﬂame front position is derived. It

is found that the leading nonlinear gravitational eﬀects stabilize the ﬂame propagating in the

direction of the ﬁeld. The resulting stationary ﬂame conﬁgurations are determined analytically.

INTRODUCTION

Propagation of plane ﬂames in gaseous mixtures is well known to be unstable. An eﬃcient

way of investigating this instability is to consider the ﬂame front as a surface of disconti-

nuity, expanding all quantities of interest in powers of Lf /λ, where Lf is the ﬂame front

thickness, and λ characteristic length scale of a ﬂame perturbation. The leading term of the

perturbation growth rate expansion has the form

σ = c0

Uf
λ

where Uf denotes an adiabatic velocity of a plane ﬂame front with respect to the fuel, and

c0 = c0(θ) a function of the gas expansion coeﬃcient θ deﬁned as the ratio of the fuel density

(ρu) and the density of burnt matter (ρb), θ = ρu/ρb > 1. According to Refs. [1, 2], c0(θ)

has positive values for all θ, implying an unconditional instability of zero-thickness ﬂames,

the Landau-Darrieus (LD) instability. In the next order in Lf/λ, account of the transport

processes inside the ﬂame front modiﬁes Eq. (1) to

σ = c0

(cid:18)

,

(cid:19)

where c1 depends on θ as well as on the ratio of the heat and mass diﬀusivities (the Lewis

number) [3, 4, 5]. The product c1Lf ≡ λc, the so-called cut-oﬀ wavelength, is the short

wavelength limit of unstable perturbations. By the order of magnitude, λc represents also

the characteristic length of the so-called cellular structure of the ﬂame front, which is formed

eventually as a result of the nonlinear ﬂame stabilization. For many ﬂames of practical

interest, c1 = 15 − 20. It is the fact that Lf is relatively small in comparison with λc which

underlies the above point of view on ﬂame dynamics.

Consider an arbitrary initially smooth front conﬁguration. As a result of the rapid growth

of the unstable ﬂame perturbations with wavelengths ∼ λc, the ﬂame front becomes corru-

gated within the time interval

(3)

Dynamics of the short wavelength modes are mainly determined by the transport processes

inside the ﬂame front, and are aﬀected only slightly by the large scale ﬂow. One can say

that the small scale cellular structure of the ﬂame front develops on the “background” of its

smooth large scale conﬁguration (see Fig. 1). It follows all developments of the background,

Eq. (3) playing the role of the characteristic time of cell adaptation to the large scale front

evolution.

In practice, it is the large scale evolution of the ﬂame front, rather than its exact local

structure, which is often of the main concern. In this respect, an important question arises

about the reverse inﬂuence of the ﬂame cellular structure on the front evolution at scales

much larger than λc. More precisely, one can state the problem as follows. Imagine that we

have smeared the small scale rapid variations of all relevant quantities by averaging them

over many ﬂame cells. Then the question is what equations governing dynamics of the

averages are.

In connection with the above statement of the problem it should be noted that the exact

cellular structure of ﬂames is actually unknown. This is because the process of cell formation

is essentially nonlinear, in the sense that it cannot be treated perturbatively in principle,

which is the main reason of lack of its theoretical description. Only in the case θ → 1,

which is practically irrelevant, can this structure be determined analytically [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

The question of principle, therefore, is to what extent the large scale dynamics of averages

depend on the exact local ﬂame structure in the regime of fully developed LD-instability.

The main purpose of the present paper is to show that to the leading order in the ratio of

3

λc to the characteristic length of the problem (L0), dynamics of the averaged quantities are

actually independent of particularities of the local ﬂame structure. The latter determines

essentially only one parameter characterizing the large scale evolution – the eﬀective normal

velocity of the ﬂame front.

Perhaps, it is worth to explain the essence of the problem in a little bit more detail. The

above point of view on the ﬂame propagation is based on the possibility to separate the

local cellular dynamics from the large scale evolution of the background. This possibility is

underlined by the following common property of the transport processes. From the mathe-

matical point of view, all these processes are of higher diﬀerential order than those governing

dynamics of an ideal ﬂuid. Therefore, their relative role increases at smaller scales. In partic-

ular, in the limit Lf → 0, cell formation is completely determined by the transport processes

inside the ﬂame front. On the contrary, the role of these processes at scales L ≫ Lf is

relatively small. It should be fully realized, however, that this reasoning is inherently linear.

It tacitly assumes that if every quantity of interest, say A, is represented as a sum of its

averaged value hAi ≡ A0 and the small scale ﬂuctuation A1, then the dynamics of A0’s can

be determined solely in terms of A0’s themselves. Because of the high nonlinearity of basic

equations governing the ﬂame propagation, this assumption is far from being self-evident.

For instance, averaging of a cubic combination of A’s gives rise to a term hA2

1iA0 comparable
0, since the small and large scale parts of the ﬂow variables are generally of the same

with A3

order of magnitude. Clearly, equations for A0’s involving such terms would not be of great

value, since the local ﬂame dynamics, and therefore, the coeﬃcients hA2

1i, are unknown. The
main result of the present work is the proof that such terms actually do not arise in the

leading order with respect to λc/L0. One can say that the governing equations for the quan-

tities A0 and A1 decouple from each other. The proof consists of two parts corresponding to

decoupling of the ﬂow equations in the bulk, and decoupling of the jump conditions at the

ﬂame front, given in Secs. II B and II C, respectively. As an application of this result, the

problem of nonlinear front stabilization in a gravitational ﬁeld will be considered in Sec. III.

The results obtained are discussed in Sec. IV.

II. THE DECOUPLING THEOREM

A. The averaging procedure

Let us begin with the precise formulation of the averaging procedure. Denote L0 the

characteristic length of the problem in question. For instance, L0 can be the tube width, in

the case of a ﬂame propagating in a tube, or be related to an external ﬁeld acting on the

system. In practice, this length largely exceeds the ﬂame cell size,

Assuming this, let us choose a length L satisfying

Analogously, denoting the characteristic time interval by T0, and noting that

we can choose T ∼ L/Uf such that

L0 ≫ λc .

λc ≪ L ≪ L0 .

T0 ∼

L0
Uf

,

λc

≪ T ≪ T0 .

Given a function A(x, t), we deﬁne its space-time average over {x, t : x ∈ (x0, x0 + ∆x),

∆xi = L, t ∈ (t0, t0 + T )}

hAi =

dt

d3x A(x, t) ≡ A0(x0, t0) .

(4)

By the deﬁnition, hAi varies noticeably over space distances k∆x0k ∼ L0, and time intervals

∆t0 ∼ T0. The function A thus turns out to be decomposed into two parts corresponding to

the two scales, L0 and λc :

A = A0 + A1,

hA1i = 0.

As was mentioned in the Introduction, ﬂame dynamics can be analyzed in the framework of

the power expansion with respect to the small ratio Lf/L0 ≡ ε (or equivalently, with respect

to λc/L0, since λc = O(Lf)). Thus, we write A0 and A1 as follows

A0 = A(0)

0 + εA(1)

0 + · · · , A1 = A(0)

1 + εA(1)

1 + · · · ,

zero order approximation with respect to ε are described by the quantities A(0)
purpose below will be to investigate coupling between A(0)
eﬀective equations governing dynamics of A(0)

1 , A(1)
0 . Accordingly, all quantities will be measured
in units relevant to the large scale dynamics. Namely, space coordinates x and time t are

1 , etc., and to obtain

0 . Our main

assumed to be normalized on L0 and L0/Uf, respectively. Furthermore, Uf will be taken as
the unit of gas velocity v, while ρuU 2

f as the unit of gas pressure p . For future reference, let

us write down their expansions explicitly

v = v0 + v1 ,

Let us now proceed to the examination of ﬂame dynamics in terms of v(0,1)

0,1 , p(0,1)
0,1 .

The main result concerning the large scale ﬂame dynamics which will be proved below

can be expressed in the form of the following

Decoupling theorem: The large scale dynamics of a ﬂame are unaﬀected by its local cellular
structure up to a rescaling. More precisely, the form of dynamical equations for v(0)

0 , p(0)

0 , as

well as of jump conditions for these quantities at the ﬂame front, is the same as in the case

of zero-thickness ﬂame propagating in an ideal ﬂuid at constant speed U Uf with respect to

the fuel, the number U > 1 describing the ﬂame front length increase due to the local front

The proof consists of two parts corresponding to decoupling of the ﬂow equations in the

bulk, and decoupling of the jump conditions at the ﬂame front, presented in Secs. II B and

wrinkling.

B. Decoupling of dynamical equations

For deﬁniteness, we will assume in what follows that external ﬁeld acting on the system

is the gravitational ﬁeld, denoting its strength by g. Accordingly, L0 will be identiﬁed with

the characteristic length associated with this ﬁeld:1

Then the dimensionless velocity and pressure ﬁelds obey the following equations in the bulk

Equation (18) involves both slowly and rapidly varying terms. The slowly varying part of this

which proves the ﬁrst part of the decoupling theorem. It is worth of mentioning that the

large scale ﬂow dynamics in the bulk turn out to be ideal at zeroth order in ε.

In connection with Eqs. (15), (16) the following circumstance should be emphasized.

These equations describe bulk dynamics of the small scale parts of the ﬂow variables at

zeroth order in Lf/L0, i.e., when the inﬂuence of the large scale ﬂows on the ﬂame cellular

structure is completely neglected. This might seem to be in contradiction with the structure
of Eq. (16), because it involves v(0)

satisfying Eq. (16) in a given space-time region {x, t : x ∈ (x0, x0 + ∆x), ∆xi = L,

explicitly. However, the functions v(0)

C. Decoupling of jump conditions

The proof of decoupling of the jump conditions is more complicated, since this is the place

where the transport processes inside the ﬂame front come into play. These conditions express

the conservation of energy and momentum across the ﬂame front. For freely propagating

ﬂames, and within the accuracy of the ﬁrst order in the small front thickness, they were

derived in the most general form in Ref. [5]. To take into account the inﬂuence of gravity, it

is suﬃcient to note that the bulk equations (14) can be rendered formally free by substituting

p = ˜p + ̺(Gx). However, gravity reappears through the jump conditions at the ﬂame front.

On the other hand, the inﬂuence of gravity on gas dynamics inside the ﬂame front is small in

comparison with the transport eﬀects; their relative value is known to be given by the inverse
Froude number F r−1 = Lf kgk/U 2

f = ε. To the leading order in ε, therefore, contribution of
the gravitational ﬁeld to the jump conditions is the same as in the case of a zero-thickness

ﬂame.

For simplicity, we will consider two-dimensional (2D) case, assuming also that the Lewis

number is equal to unity. No assumption is made concerning the incoming ﬂow, except that
its characteristic length ˜L ≥ L0. Let the ﬂame front position be described by an equation

z = f (x, t), where the Cartesian coordinates (x, z) are scaled on L0, and chosen so that

z-axis is parallel to G. The x- and z-components of the ﬂow velocity will be denoted by w

and u, v = (w, u). We also introduce the unit vector τ tangential to the ﬂame front, and n

orthogonal to it (pointing to the burnt matter). In components,

At this point, it is worth to make the following comment on the meaning of the above

asymptotic relations. Equations (23)–(26) were derived in Ref. [5] under assumption that

the terms in the right hand sides of these equations, proportional to ε, are small, which

is only true if the gas ﬂow is characterized by a length scale much larger than the ﬂame

front thickness. However, the rapidly developing LD-instability makes any smooth ﬂame

conﬁguration highly corrugated within the time interval of the order (3). As a result, the

ε-terms turn out to be of the order Lf/λc = O(1). Similarly, account of the ε2-corrections
in the above equations would give rise to terms of the order L2

c = O(1) etc., questioning
thereby validity of the small ε-expansion. However, it was mentioned in the Introduction

f /λ2

that in practice, the cut-oﬀ wavelength λc is noticeably larger than the ﬂame front thickness

Lf. Thus, in the regime of fully developed LD-instability, the right hand sides of Eqs. (23)–

(26) are to be considered the leading order terms of the asymptotic expansion in powers

of Lf/λc = 1/c1 , rather than Lf/L0 = ε. On the contrary, ε is the true parameter of the

power expansions (6), (7), which determines the relative order of successive terms in these

In order to extract from Eqs. (23)–(25) jump conditions for the quantities v(0)

0 , p(0)

0 , we

need to introduce an auxiliary operation of averaging along the front. Let a quantity A be

deﬁned on the ﬂame front, i.e., for {x, z, t : z = f (x, t)}. Given a point x0, choose ∆x =

∆x(x0) such that the front length L(t) between the points (x0, f (x0, t)) and (x0, f (x0+∆x, t))

expansions.

satisﬁes

λc ≪ L(t) ≪ L0, L(t) = O(L)

for all t ∈ (t0, t0 +T ). This is always possible since L(t) is of the order of distance between the

two points. Then the average value of A over {x, z, t : x ∈ (x0, x0 + ∆x), t ∈ (t0, t0 + T ), z =

Using the operation introduced, the quantities τ , n deﬁned on the front, as well as the

ﬂame front position itself, can be decomposed into two parts corresponding to the scales L0

and λc, in a way analogous to Eqs. (5)–(7):

τ = τ0 + τ1 ,

f = f0 + f1 ,

be inserted into Eqs. (23)–(25), with the subsequent averaging of the latter along the ﬂame

front.

Let us begin with the jump of the normal component of the gas velocity.

In view of

Eq. (13), one can introduce the stream function ψ = ψ(x, z, t) according to

Using the operation of the bulk averaging (4), the function ψ can be decomposed as

ﬂame front length due to its small scale wrinkling.

Let us turn to the examination of the remaining jump conditions. Because of the ε-terms

in the right hand sides of Eqs. (24), (25), which involve highly nonlinear combinations of the

ﬂow variables and the function f (x, t), there seems to be a very little hope that the large

scale parts of the ﬂow variables eventually decouple from their small scale parts describing

ﬂame cellular structure. Nevertheless, they do, as will be shown presently.

As we have seen, in zero order approximation with respect to ε, the quantities k1, α1, π1,

and U entering these equations are independent of the coordinate x0 and the time instant

t0. These constants can in principle be calculated provided that the exact small scale ﬂame

structure is known. However, as it follows from the above equations, this information is

actually unnecessary, because dynamics of the large scale ﬁelds are independent of the

speciﬁc values of these constants. Indeed, since the gas pressure enters dynamical equation

only through its gradient, it is determined up to a constant. Therefore, the constants k1, α1,

π1, are irrelevant. Unlike these, however, the constant U has a direct physical meaning. As is

seen from Eq. (54), U plays the role of the eﬀective dimensionless velocity of the curved ﬂame

propagation. According to our choice of units, the gas velocity is scaled on the adiabatic

velocity of a plane ﬂame front Uf which is also used to deﬁne the units of pressure, time,

and length [see the deﬁnition (12) of L0]. In analyzing the large scale ﬂame dynamics, it is

more natural to choose U · Uf, rather than Uf, as the velocity unit. Then U disappears from

the jump conditions at the ﬂame front, as well as from the ﬂow equations (17), (21) in the

bulk, which thus take the form of the equations governing propagation of a zero-thickness

ﬂame in an ideal ﬂuid at constant speed UUf with respect to the fuel, f being the ﬂame
front position, while ~n and ~t the normal and tangential unit vectors to f, respectively. The

decoupling theorem is proved.

III. NONLINEAR FLAME STABILIZATION IN GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

The proved theorem considerably widens the scope of issues in ﬂame dynamics accessible

for analytical investigation. One of the most important consequences of the decoupling

theorem is that unlike the local cellular dynamics, the large scale ﬂame dynamics can be

investigated in the framework of perturbation expansion with respect to the ﬂame front

slope, provided that the external ﬁeld exerts a stabilizing inﬂuence on the ﬂame. This fact

will be illustrated below in the case of a ﬂame propagating in an initially quiescent ﬂuid in

the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld. As is well known (see, e.g., Ref. [11]), in this case

gravity plays the stabilizing role at the linear stage of development of the LD-instability.

Our aim will be to determine the role of the nonlinear eﬀects, and to explore the possibility

of a full stabilization of the curved ﬂame front by the gravitational ﬁeld.

We will follow the general method of deriving weakly nonlinear equations for the ﬂame

front position, developed in Ref. [12]. It consists in bringing the system of hydrodynamic

equations together with the jump conditions at the ﬂame front to the so-called transverse

representation in which dependence of all ﬂow variables on the coordinate in the direction

of ﬂame propagation (z) is rendered purely parametric, and then reducing this system to

a single equation for the front position. The calculation in the presence of gravity is very

similar to that in the case of a freely propagating ﬂame. Therefore, derivation of the equation

will be only sketched below, referring the reader to the work [12] for more detail.

As was mentioned in the end of the preceding section, it is natural to take UUf as the

velocity unit, redeﬁning accordingly the units of length, time, and pressure to

respectively. For simplicity, designation of the ﬂow variables as well as space coordinates

Since the fuel is assumed initially quiescent, the ﬂow is potential upstream, and the general

solution of Eqs. (55), (56) can be readily written down. In the reference frame of an initially

The LD-operator ˆΦ is related to ˆH by ˆΦ = − ˆH · ∂/∂x . Equation (59) is nothing but the

Bernoulli equation written in the transverse form.

Because of the vorticity produced by the curved ﬂame front, the ﬂow of products of

combustion is not potential. Nevertheless, the following transverse relation between the

ﬂow variables downstream can be obtained from Eqs. (55), (56) at the second order of

nonlinearity

from which it follows that at the linear stage of development of the LD-instability, the

gravitational ﬁeld plays the stabilizing role in the case of ﬂame propagation in the direction
of ~G (G = +1), and destabilizing in the opposite case (G = −1). To determine the role of

the nonlinear terms, let us assume that there exists a stationary regime of ﬂame propagation.

It is not diﬃcult to see that the nonlinear term proportional to G exerts a stabilizing inﬂuence

on the ﬂame if G = +1. Indeed, if we take

f(x, t) ∼ eσt sin(kx),

(64)

Eq. (62) can be roughly considered as a “dispersion relation” for the increment σ. As we

see, the nonlinear term decreases σ if G = +1, and vice versa. Therefore, Eq. (63) can

only have solutions if G = +1, and the question of whether the ﬂame can be stabilized

by the gravitational ﬁeld reduces to the question of existence of nontrivial solutions to this

equation.7

7 The last term in the non-stationary equation (62) is also proportional to G. Unlike the other two, it has
a destabilizing eﬀect on the ﬂame front in the case G = +1. Indeed, using the deﬁnition of the Hilbert
operator (60), and substituting expression (64) into this term, one ﬁnds

This term, however, is irrelevant to the issue of existence of stationary conﬁgurations, since it contains ˙f.
Whether the gravitational ﬁeld has an overall stabilizing eﬀect, or not, depends on solvability of the
stationary equation (63).

Equation (63) is a nonlinear integro-diﬀerential equation with respect to φ = f′. To solve
this equation, we ﬁrst transform it as follows. Let us rewrite the nonlinear term ˆΦ(f′)2

f′′ = −

ˆΦf + O(f′2).

In connection with the transformation performed, it is worth to emphasize validity of the

weak nonlinearity expansion when applied to the investigation of the large scale ﬂame

dynamics. As was shown in detail in Refs. [9, 10], this expansion turns out to be self-

contradictory in the case of a freely propagating stationary ﬂame treated in the framework

of the thin front model. This fact can be seen directly from Eq. (63) with G = 0, in which
case this equation reduces to the equality of two quantities of apparently diﬀerent orders – f′′
and ˆΦ(f′)2 .8 Only if θ → 1 does the weak nonlinearity expansion of stationary ﬂames make
sense, since then f′ = O(θ − 1), f′′ = O((θ − 1)2), so both terms in Eq. (63) are O((θ − 1)3)
quantities. On the contrary, in the presence of the gravitational ﬁeld, f′ can be treated as
the ﬁrst order quantity when (θ − 1) is not small, because θf′′ and G ˆΦf are of the ﬁrst order

8 Perhaps, it is worth to stress once more that despite similarity of Eq. (62) with G = 0 to that obtained in
Ref. [12], its meaning is completely diﬀerent. In the notation of Sec. II C, the latter equation determines
the function f (0)

1 , while Eq. (62) – the function f (0)
0 .

in this case, and nothing prevents their sum from being formally a second order quantity. In
fact, (θ − 1) must be ﬁnite in the latter case, since the second order term (θ − 1)G ˆΦf would

be the only second order term in Eq. (63) otherwise. As we will see below, solutions to this

equation turn out to be unbounded for θ → 1.

Turning back to Eq. (65), let us show ﬁrst of all that its solutions, if any, are non-periodic.
Notice that if f(x) is a periodic function, then [ ˆH(f − ¯f)](x), where ¯f is the mean value of f,
is also periodic with the same period [substraction of ¯f is necessary, because ˆH is undeﬁned

on constants, see Eq. (60)]. Let us integrate Eq. (65) over period. The ﬁrst two terms in

this equation give rise to zero:

Of course, the absence of periodic solutions could be inferred already from Eq. (63). It is

seen that such solutions are forbidden by the positive deﬁnite nonlinear term proportional

which is consistent with the assumed positivity of Im x1 if G = +1. It is not diﬃcult to

show that the same is true in the general case of arbitrary number of poles. Consider the

imaginary part of Eq. (67) corresponding to the pole uppermost in the complex plane, and

take into account that β > γ. The fact that the system (67) is inconsistent for G = −1 does

not mean, of course, that the nonlinear stabilization is impossible in this case. Investigation

of such a possibility requires account of higher order corrections.

Equation (65) is derived in the scope of the power expansion with respect to the ﬂame

front slope φ. In the case of the two-pole solution, |φ| takes its maximal value

at the points xm = x0 ± Im x1. We see that the developed weak nonlinearity expansion is

valid if θ is not too close to unity. For realistic values of the expansion coeﬃcient (θ = 5−10)

The pole conﬂuence is in fact a common property of the solutions (66). To see this, let us

The question of which conﬁguration is realized in the given conditions requires carrying

out the stability analysis of various pole solutions, and can be solved, of course, only on

the basis of the general non-stationary Eq. (62). According to the deﬁnition of f, such an

analysis is to be performed with respect to perturbations with wavelengths λ ∼ L0.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The large scale ﬂame dynamics are independent of its local cellular structure in zero

order approximation with respect to the ﬂame front thickness. This is the main result of

the work, proved in Sec. II. The local ﬂame corrugation only aﬀects the value of the normal

velocity Uf changing it to UUf , where U > 1 describes increase of the front length due to its

wrinkling. In the scope of the thin front model, Uf plays the role of an external parameter

specifying the characteristic velocity of the problem under consideration. Thus, the overall

eﬀect of the local ﬂame structure on its large scale evolution amounts to a renormalization

of this parameter. For ﬂames of practical importance, the U-factor is about 1.3 − 1.5. In

fact, it is UUf, rather than Uf, which is more convenient to measure experimentally, since the

measurement of Uf requires special facilities to suppress development of the LD-instability,

such as those used in Ref. [13].

The decoupling theorem allows one to avoid the diﬃcult issues arising in investigating

ﬂame dynamics at length scales of the order λc, and to go directly to scales characterizing

the problem in question. This is particularly important in numerical simulations of the

ﬂame dynamics. The computational grid should be chosen so as to well resolve the ﬂame

cellular structure, which leaves a little space for investigation of larger scales because of the

limitations of computational facilities.

The decoupling theorem also opens the way for analytical investigation of the large scale

ﬂame dynamics. As an example, the nonlinear development of the LD-instability in the

presence of the gravitational ﬁeld was considered in Sec. III, where a weakly nonlinear non-

stationary equation for the ﬂame front position was obtained [Eq. (62)]. This equation

admits stationary solutions in the case of ﬂame propagation in the direction of the ﬁeld,

which means that the gravitational ﬁeld has a stabilizing overall eﬀect in this case. The

resulting stationary ﬂame conﬁguration turns out to be essentially non-periodic, and repre-

sents a symmetrical “hump” in the direction of the ﬂame propagation, with slowly decreasing

logarithmic “tails.” A complete investigation of the non-stationary equation will be given

elsewhere.

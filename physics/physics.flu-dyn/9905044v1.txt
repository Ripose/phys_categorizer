Abstract

The Eulerian system of dynamic equations for the ideal (nondissipative)
ﬂuid is closed but incomplete. The complete system of dynamic equations
arises after appending Lin constraints which describe motion of ﬂuid particles
in a given velocity ﬁeld. The complete system of dynamic equations fo the
ideal ﬂuid can be integrated. Description in terms of hydrodynamic potentials
(DTHP) arises as a result of this integration. The integrated system contains
indeﬁnite functions of three arguments, which can be expressed via initial and
boundary conditions. The remaining initial and boundary conditions for the
integrated system can be made universal (i.e. the same for all ﬂuid ﬂows),
and the resulting system of equations contains full information about the
ﬂuid ﬂow including initial and boundary conditions for the ﬂuid ﬂow. Some
hydrodynamic potentials appear to be frozen into the ﬂuid, and the Kelvin’s
theorem on the velocity circulation can be formulated in a contour-free form.
Description in terms of the wave function (DTWF) appears to be a kind of
DTHP. Calculation of slightly rotational ﬂows can be carried out on the basis
of DTHP, or DTWF. Such a description of a rotational ﬂow appears to be
eﬀective.

The system of hydrodynamic equations (1.1)–(1.3) is a closed system of diﬀer-
ential equations which has an unique solution inside some space-time region Ω, pro-
vided dependent dynamic variables ρ and v =
, S are given as functions
of three arguments on the space-time boundary Γ of the region Ω. Being closed, the
system (1.1)–(1.3) describes nevertheless only momentum-energetic characteristics
of the ﬂuid. Motion of the ﬂuid particles along trajectories is described by so called
Lin (1963) constraints

will be referred to as particle labeling (curvilinear Lagrangian coordinates). If the
equations (1.4) are solved and ξ is determined as a function of (t, x), the ﬁnite
relations

{

(1.4)

(1.5)

ξ(t, x) = ξin = const

describe implicitly a ﬂuid particle trajectory and a motion along it.

The system of eight equations (1.1) –(1.4) forms a complete system of dynamic
equations describing a ﬂuid, whereas the system of ﬁve equations (1.1)–(1.3) forms
a curtailed system of dynamic equations. The last system is closed, but to be a
complete system, it must be supplemented by the kinematic equations

dx
dt

= v(t, x),

x = x(t, ξ)

(1.6)

where v(t, x) is a solution of the system (1.1)-(1.3). Three equations (1.6) are
equivalent to (1.4), because any solution ξ = ξ(t, x) of (1.4) is a set of three integrals
of equations (1.6).

There is a lack of understanding of the fact that the Euler system (1.1)–(1.3) is a
curtailed one and that the equations (1.4) describe a motion of ﬂuid particles. Even
Lin (1963) who introduced equations (1.4) considered them ”as the condition for the
conservation of the identity of particles”, but not as kinematic equations describing
a motion of ﬂuid particles in a given velocity ﬁeld. Betherton (1970) investigated the
Lin constraints and showed a connection between them and the Kelvin’s theorem on
the velocity circulation. But the very important statement that the Lin constraints
(1.4) are a kind of kinematic equations (1.6) was not mentioned directly. In general,
we failed to ﬁnd in literature any reference to equations (1.4) as necessary kinematic
equations, although this fact seems to be evident. Apparently, it is connected with
the common belief that the Lin constraints (1.4) are useless, if one is interested only
in the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂow.

We should like to show a necessity of these equations in a very simple example,
modelling a situation in the hydrodynamics in a grotesque form. Let us consider a
particle moving in uniform gravitational ﬁeld g =const. Dynamic equations have
the form

˙v = g,

˙x = v,

g = const

(1.7)

2

where x and v are functions of t describing respectively position and velocity of
the particle. First three equations (1.7) constitute a closed subsystem [analog of
the Euler system (1.1)–(1.3)] of the full system of six equations. Equations of the
subsystem can be solved independently of the remaining equations. But it does
not mean that this closed subsystem may be considered as a system of dynamic
equations describing a particle, even if we are interested only in momentum-energetic
properties of the particle. Such important characteristic of the particle as the energy
integral v2/2
gx = const cannot be derived on the base of only ﬁrst three equations
(1.7). This integral is a sum of integrals

These integrals are analogs of integrals of the complete system (1.1)-(1.4) [see below
(1.11)]. This example shows that a closed system of equations and a complete system
of dynamic equations is not the same. The Lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamic
equation includes equations (1.4) in the form (1.6) automatically. Lagrangian for-
mulation is equivalent to the Eulerian formulation (1.1)–(1.3), provided equations
(1.4) are appended to it.

Equations (1.1), (1.3) can be integrated on the basis of (1.4) in the form

If ﬁve dependent variables ϕ, ξ, η satisfy the system of equations (1.4), (1.12), (1.13),
the ﬁve dynamic variables S, ρ, v (1.9)–(1.11) satisfy dynamic equations (1.1)–(1.3).
Indeﬁnite functions gα(ξ) can be determined from initial and boundary conditions
in such a way that the initial and boundary conditions for variables ϕ, ξ, η were
universal in the sense that they do not depend on the ﬂuid ﬂow.

According to (1.10), (1.11) the physical quantities ρ, v are obtained as a result of
diﬀerentiation of the variables ϕ, ξ, S, and the variables ϕ, ξ, η can be regarded as
hydrodynamic potentials. These potentials appear in the Hamilton ﬂuid dynamics

3

(Salmon, 1988) as dependent variables. The hydrodynamic potentials arise by a
natural way. They associate with the name of Clebsch (1857, 1859) who introduced
these quantities for the incompressible ﬂuid. Such quantities as gα(ξ) also appear in
the Hamilton ﬂuid mechanics (Salmon,1988), but they appear as dependent variables
(Lagrage invariants) satisfying dynamic equations of the type (1.4). They also are
regarded as hydrodynamic potentials. Note that in the Hamilton ﬂuid mechanics
the quantities gα are considered simply as dependent variables, but not as indeﬁnite
functions of ξ, arising as a result of integration, although corresponding dynamic
equations for gα can be integrated easily.

It should distinguish between the integration and a change of variables which
does not contain arbitrary functions explicitly. For instance, let us substitute gα(ξ),
α = 1, 2, 3 by new dependent variables Aα, α = 1, 2, 3, imposing on them constraints

The eighth order system (1.4), (1.12)–(1.15) arises instead of the ﬁfth order
system (1.4), (1.11)–(1.13). This system is not an integrated one, because it has
the higher order and contains only two arbitrary functions (1.9), (1.10). Diﬀerent
modiﬁcations of such kind systems were derived (Salmon, 1988). They cannot be
considered as integrated systems. Of course, one can easily integrate equtions (1.14)
on the basis of (1.4), and return to (1.11). But until this is not made and the
number of dynamic variables is not decreased, the system cannot be considered as
integrated.

The integration of the complete system (1.1)-(1.4) and some corollaries of this
integration correlates with the Hamilton properties of the ideal ﬂuid [Harivel, (1955);
Eckart, (1960); Seliger and Whithem, (1967), Salmon, (1988); Zakharov and Kuznetsov
(1997)]. It is connected with the fact that the curtailed system (1.1)-(1.3) is not a
Hamiltonian system in itself, whereas the complete system (1.1)-(1.4) is a Hamil-
tonian one that can be easily seen in the example (1.7). Constructing Hamiltonian
mechanics of the ideal ﬂuid, one uses (implicitly or explicitly) the Lin constraints
(or part of them). It is this expansion of the curtailed system (but not Hamiltonian
properties) that is important for integration and derivation of other useful results.
To show this, the Hamiltonian technique and Hamiltonian properties of the ideal
ﬂuid will not be used at all.

Note that the curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3) has the same order as the integrated
system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13), but it takes into account neither initial conditions,
nor kinematic equations (1.6). The fact that the ideal ﬂuid considered as a dynamic
system admits both the curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3) and the integrated system (1.4),
(1.12), (1.13) is connected closely with the group of the relabeling transformation

The relabeling group is a symmetry group of the ﬂuid considered as a dynamic
system. This circumstance admits to integrate the complete system (1.1)–(1.4). Any
special particle labeling is unessential from physical viewpoint. It is a reason why
several equations (1.1)–(1.3) of the complete system form a closed system describing
conservation laws. The relabeling group is used in hydrodynamics comparatively
recently Eckart (1938, 1960), Calkin (1963), Bretherton (1970), Friedman and Schutz
(1978), Salmon (1982), Zacharov and Kuznetsov (1997) and others.

The integrated system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13) looks more complicated, than the
curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3). It is quite natural, because the integrated system is a
complete system which contains ﬁve indeﬁnite functions ρ0, S0, gα describing initial
and boundary conditions.

There is a common belief that the curtailed Eulerian system (1.1)–(1.3) is suﬃ-
cient for calculating ﬂuid ﬂows, and a use of the complete system (1.1)–(1.4) is not
necessary in most of cases. In general, there is a puzzling question of such a kind.
If both the Euler system (1.1)-(1.3) and the integrated system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13)
have the same order and the same number of dependent variables, why should one
consider the integrated system (1.4), (1.12), (1.3) which looks more complicated,
than the Euler system? The answer is as follows. Although the Lin constraints de-
scribe mainly a motion of ﬂuid particles in the given velocity ﬁeld, nevertheless the
integrated system contains additional information which is necessary for a calcula-
tion of rotational ﬂuid ﬂows. This additional information concerns ﬂuid properties
described by the Kelvin’s theorem on the velocity circulation. This theorem is an
attribute of the complete system (1.1)-(1.4), because it refers to the contour con-
nected rigidly with the ﬂuid particles moving according to dynamic equations (1.6),
or (1.4). In general, the Kelvin’s theorem cannot be formulated only in terms of
the velocity ﬁeld. On the other hand, it is clear that the ﬂuid properties (vorticity
frozen into ﬂuid) described by the Kelvin’s theorem are very important for calculat-
ing rotational ﬂows, whereas for irrotational ﬂows the constraints imposed by the
Kelvin’s theorem degenerate into identities which are fulﬁlled automatically.

The conventional theory of ﬂuid ﬂows is based mainly on the Euler system (1.1)-
(1.3) which does not take into account constrains of the Kelvin’s theorem. Theory
of irrotational ﬂows has been developed well enough, whereas that of rotational
ﬂows has been developed much slightly. Apparently, it is connected with the fact
that the Euler system (1.1)-(1.3) does not contain enough information on the ﬂuid
properties, and proper calculations of rotational ﬂows are impossible in the scope
of the curtailed Euler system (1.1)-(1.3). Especially it concerns strongly rotational
(turbulent) ﬂows.
It will be shown in this paper that slightly rotational ﬂows of
incompressible ﬂuid can be calculated on the basis of the integrated system (1.4),
(1.12), (1.13) (DTHP or DTWF), where integrals (1.11) are taken into account.

The integrals (1.11) can be interpreted as a contour-free form of the Kelvin’s

where εαβγ is the Levi-Chivita pseudotensor, and a summation is produced (1-3)
over repeated Greek indices. dS and dSξ are inﬁnitesimal area of contours
and

theorem. The scalar ωdS conserves and does not depend on time, although ω and dS
individually depend on time. For any irrotational ﬂow the relation (1.20) degenerates
into identity, and Kelvin’s theorem may be ignored.

Note that Ω(ξ) may be regarded as a ”frozen vorticity”, because it depends on
time t only via ξ, and Ω = ω, provided ξ = x. Ω(ξ) is a scalar in the x-space, and
it is a vector in the ξ-space of labels ξ.

For derivation of integrated system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13) one uses a speciﬁc mathe-
matical technique based on Jacobian properties. This technique permits to integrate
dynamic equations without a use of a change of variables. In general, all results can
be obtained, carrying out a proper change of variables in the action functional by
means of the Lagrange multipliers. Such changes of dependent variables are pro-
duced in the Hamilton ﬂuid dynamics (see, for instance, Salmon, 1988). Dynamic
equations of the type of (1.3) appear as a result of such changes of variables. These
equations can be integrated easily on the basis of equations (1.4). Unfortunately,
such changes of variables lead to diﬀerent sets of dependent variables whose physi-
cal meaning is unclear. In other words, using Lagrange multipliers, for a change of
variables, one obscures logical connection between diﬀerent variables. It is rather

6

diﬃcult to understand that, integrating some equations of the type of (1.3), one
integrates in reality the equations (1.2). To simplify the logical connection between
diﬀerent dependent variables and to clear their physical meaning, we prefer to inte-
grate dynamic equations directly by means of ”Jacobian technique” (sec. 2). Use
of Jacobians in hydrodynamics has had a long history, dating back to the time of
Clebsch (1857, 1859).
It was the use of Jacobians that allowed to introduce the
Clebsch potentials and integrate hydrodynamic equations.

The Jacobian technique was used by many authors (Herivel (1955), Eckart(1960),
Berdichevski (1983), Salmon (1988), Zacharov and Kuznetsov (1997) and many
others). We use space-time symmetric version of the Jacobian technique which
appears to be simple and eﬀective. It seems that the progress in the integration of
hydrodynamic equations is connected mainly with the developed Jacobian technique.

The last equality follows from the ﬁrst identity (2.7) taken for s = 0, l = 1, 2, . . . n
Interpretation of the line (2.14) tangent to the ﬂux is diﬀerent for diﬀerent cases.
If x =
contains only spatial coordinates, the line (2.14) is a line in the
usual space. It is regarded as a stream line, and ξ can be interpreted as quantities
which are constant along the stream line (i.e. as a generalized stream function).
If x0 is the time coordinate, the equation (2.14) describes a line in the space-time.
This line (known as a world line of a ﬂuid particle) determines a motion of the ﬂuid
particle. Variables ξ =
which are constant along the world line are
diﬀerent, generally, for diﬀerent particles. If ξα, α = 1, 2, . . . n are independent, they
may be used for the ﬂuid particle labeling.

ξ1, ξ2, . . . ξn}

{

Thus, although interpretation of the relation (2.9) considered as a change of
dependent variables j by ξ may be diﬀerent, from the mathematical viewpoint this
transformation means a replacement of the continuity equation by some equations
for the labeling (or generalized stream function) ξ. Diﬀerence of the interpretation
is of no importance in this context.

As an example of application of the Jacobian technique, let us show that (1.10)
satisﬁes (1.1) in virtue of (1.4). Let us multiply (1.4) by (1.10) and introduce new

continuity equation (2.10) identically. Thus, (1.1) is satisﬁed by (1.10) in virtue of
(1.4).

3 Variational principle

In general, equivalency of the system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13) and the system (1.1)–(1.4)
can be veriﬁed by a direct substitution of variables ρ, S, v, deﬁned by the relations
(1.9)–(1.11), into the equations (1.1)–(1.3). Using equations (1.4), (1.12), (1.13),
one obtains identities after subsequent calculations. But such computations do not
display a connection between the integration and the invariancy with respect to the
relabeling group (1.16). Besides a meaning of new variables ϕ, η is not clear. We
shall use for our investigations a variational principle. Note that for a long time
a derivation of a variational principle for hydrodynamic equaitons (1.1)–(1.3) was
existing as a self-dependent problem (Davydov, 1949; Herivel, 1955; Eckart, 1960;
Lin, 1963; Seliger and Whithem, 1967; Bretherton, 1970; Salmon, 1988). Existence
of this problem was connected with a lack of understanding that the system of
hydrodynamic equations (1.1)–(1.3) is a curtailed system, and the full system of
dynamic equations (1.1)–(1.4) includes equations (1.4) describing a motion of the
ﬂuid particles in the given velocity ﬁeld. The variational principle can generate only
the complete system of dynamic variables (but not its closed subsystem). Without
understanding this one tried to form the Lagrangian for the system (1.1)–(1.3) as a
sum of some quantities taken with Lagrange multipliers. lhs of dynamic equations
(1.1)–(1.3) and some other constraints were taken as such quantities.

Now this problem has been solved (see review by Salmon, 1988) on the basis
of the Eulerian version of the variational principle for the Lagrangian description,
where equations (1.4) appear automatically and cannot be ignored. In our version of
the variational principle we follow Salmon (1988) with some modiﬁcations which un-
derline a curtailed character of hydrodynamic equations (1.1)–(1.3), because the un-
derstanding of the curtailed character of the system (1.1)–(1.3) removes the problem
of derivation of the variational principle for the hydrodynamic equations (1.1)–(1.3).
We consider the ideal ﬂuid as a conservative dynamic system whose dynamic
equations can be derived from the variational principle. This dynamic system is
a continuous set of many identical particles moving in some self-consistent (and
external) potential force ﬁeld. The action functional has the form

ρ0(ξ) is some non-negative weight function, and V is a potential of a self-consistent
force ﬁeld which depends on ξ, x and derivatives of x with respect to ξ. m =const
is some mass of the ﬂuid particle. The form of the potential V will be ﬁxed later.
Now it is important only that V does not depend on the time derivatives of x.

Variation of the action with respect to x generates six ﬁrst order dynamic equa-
tions for six dependent variables x, v = dx/dt, considered as functions of t and of
independent curvilinear Lagrangian coordinates ξ. It is a Lagrangian representation
of hydrodynamic equations.

We prefer to work with Eulerian representation, when Lagrangian coordinates
(particle labeling) ξ =

and Eulerian coordinates x =

independent variables. Here ξ0 is a temporal Lagrangian coordinate which evolves
along the particle trajectory in an arbitrary way. Now the ξ0 is a ﬁctive variable,
but after integration of equations the ξ0 stops to be ﬁctive and turns to the variable
ϕ, appearing in the integrated system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13).

quence of the integration of dynamic equations. The integrated system contains ﬁve
ﬁrst order equations for dependent variables ξ0, ξ, η. The dependent variable S is
substituted by arbitrary indeﬁnite function S0(ξ).

To obtain the dynamic equations, it is convenient to introduce new dependent
variables ji, deﬁned by (2.16). Let us introduce the new variables ji by means of
designations (2.16) taken with the Lagrange multipliers pi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then the

It is useful to keep in mind that four designations (2.16), introducing variables ρ,
j = ρv via variables ξ, are equivalent to three Lin constraints (1.4) together with the
designation (3.4), as it was shown in the end of sec.2. Addition of relations (2.16) to
the action (3.13) as side constraints is equivalent to the addition of relations (1.4),
(3.4) considered as side constraints.

For obtaining dynamic equations the variables ρ, j, ξ, p, η, S are to be varied. Let
us eliminate the variables pi from the action (3.14). Dynamic equations arising as a

Then the equations (3.23) and (3.21) can be integrated in the form of (1.9)

one obtains the equation (1.12) and, hence, the system of dynamic equations (1.4),
(1.12), (1.13), where designations (1.9)–(1.11) are used.

The curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3) can be obtained from equations (3.21)–(3.26)

the last equation is equivalent to (1.2).

Thus, diﬀerentiating equations (3.25), (3.26) and eliminating the variables ϕ, ξ,
η, one obtains the curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3), whereas the system (1.4), (1.12),
(1.13) follows from the system (3.21)–(3.26) directly (i.e. without diﬀerentiating).
It means that the system (1.4), (1.12), (1.13) is an integrated system, whereas the
curtailed system (1.1)–(1.3) is not, although formally they have the same order.

The action of the form (3.20), or close to this form was obtained by some authors
(Seliger and Whithem, 1967; Salmon, 1988), but the quantities gα, α = 1, 2, 3 are
always considered as additional dependent variables (but not as indeﬁnite functions
of ξ which can be expressed via initial conditions). The action was not considered
as a functional of ﬁxed indeﬁnite functions gα(ξ).

The variable η was introduced, for the action be invariant with respect to the
transformations of the whole relabeling group (1.16). To understand what the η
means from the mathematical viewpoint, let us return to the action (3.9), where
the internal energy E has the form (3.10). Adding new variables j by means of
designations (2.16), one obtains instead of (3.14)

E[ρ, j, ξ, p] =

α = 1, 2, 3

where linear operators ˆ
Lα are deﬁned by (3.15). Equations (3.34) are linear non-
uniform equations for the variables p. A solution of (3.34) is a sum of the general
solution (3.19) of the uniform equations (3.15) and of a particular solution the non-
uniform equations (3.34). This particular solution depends on the form of the func-
ηjk∂kS with
tion S0 and cannot be found in a general form. Adding an extraterm
η satisfying (3.24) to (3.13), a reduction of non-uniform equations (3.34) to uniform
equations (3.15) appears to be possible. Thus, the extravariable η is responsible for
the particular solution of (3.34).

−

From the viewpoint of the action (3.33) a dependence of the internal energy
E on the entropy means simply a dependence of E on the labels ξ via a function
S(ξ). If such a dependence cannot be expressed through one function (for instance

15

E = E[ρ, S1(ξ), S2(ξ)]) the ideal ﬂuid is described by two entropies S1 and S2 and
by two temperatures T1 = ∂E/∂S1, T2 = ∂E/∂S2. Such a situation may appear
for a conducting ﬂuid in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, where there are two temperatures
– longitudinal and transversal.

Thus ﬁve equations (1.4), (1.12), (1.13) with S, ρ and v, deﬁned respectively by
(1.9), (1.10) and (1.11), constitute the ﬁfth order system for ﬁve dependent variables
ξ =
, η. Equations (1.1), (1.3),(1.4), (1.12),(1.13) constitute the seventh order
system for seven variables ρ, ξ, ϕ, η, S.

4 Initial and Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions describing vessel walls can be taken into account by means of
a proper choice of the internal energy E(x, ρ, S) which can include the energy of the
ﬂuid in an external potential U.

E = E0(ρ, S) + U(t, x),

Let us show that indeﬁnite functions g, S0, ρ0 can be expressed via initial and
boundary conditions (4.3)–(4.7). The initial conditions for the system (3.21)–(3.26)
have the form

ξα(0, x) = ξα

in(x),

α = 1, 2, 3

ρ(0, x) = ρin(x),

S(0, x) = S0[ξin(x)],

(4.9)-(4.11) take place at x

(4.12)

It is clear that ﬁve functions g, ϕin, ηin cannot be determined unambiguously from
three relations (4.12).

There are at least two diﬀerent approaches to determination of functions ξin(x)

and g(ξ).

(1) One ﬁxes the functions ξα

in(x) in some conventional way, sets

ϕin(x) = 0,

ηin(x) = 0,

x

∈ I

(4.13)

and determines functions g from three relations (4.12).

(2) Functions g are ﬁxed in some conventional way, and remaining functions are

determined from relations (4.12)

The ﬁrst way. Let the condition (4.9) be given in the form

ξα(0, x) = ξα

in(x) = xα,

α = 1, 2, 3,

x

.

∈ I

(4.14)

In other words, at t = 0 the labels ξ coincide with the Eulerian coordinates to within
a constant factor. The relations (4.12) take the form

gβ[ξin(x)] = vβ

in(x),

α = 1, 2, 3;

x

,

∈ I

(4.15)

which are resolved in the form

gα(ξ) = vα

in(ξ),

α = 1, 2, 3,

ξ3 > 0,

(4.16)

Thus, the functions g are expressed through initial conditions (4.3).

The boundary conditions for the system of equations (3.21)-(3.26) have the form

(4.24)

Substituting relations (4.21) into (4.22), (4.23), one obtains three equations for
determination of functions g(ξ). Resolving this system of equations with respect to
g, one obtains

gα(ξ) = vα
b (

ξ3/c, ξ1, ξ2),

α = 1, 2;

ξ3 < 0

−
g3(ξ) = c−1Kb(

−

ξ3/c, ξ1, ξ2),

ξ3 < 0

(4.25)

Thus, g(ξ) is determined by (4.16) for ξ3 > 0 and by (4.25) for ξ3 < 0. In other
words, the boundary conditions and the initial conditions determine the vector ﬁeld
g(ξ) in diﬀerent regions of the argument ξ. All information about the velocities at the
initial moment and on the boundary has been transferred into dynamic equations.
The ﬁeld g(ξ) can describe both initial and boundary conditions.

The second way. Let us choose the functions g in a simple form. Let for instance,

g1(ξ) = ξ2,

g2(ξ) = 0,

g3(ξ) = 0

Let us set

Then the expression (1.11) takes the form

variables ρ, χ, λ, µ, η, S do not contain indeﬁnite functions and have an unambiguous
form.

If the ﬂuid is described in terms of Clebsch potentials, the dynamic equations
contain neither arbitrary functions, nor information about the initial conditions.
It should be interpreted in the sense that the description (4.28)-(4.29) in terms of
the Clebsch potentials is a result of a change of variables in dynamic equations
(1.1)-(1.3), whereas the description (3.21)-(3.26) is a result of integration of the
dynamic equations (1.1)-(1.4). In other words, the description (4.28)-(4.29) in terms
of Clebsch potentials relates to the description (3.21)-(3.26) in the same way, as a
particular solution of a system of diﬀerential equations relates to a general solution
of the same system.

Let us note that there are many other ways for determination of indeﬁnite func-
tions g(ξ). For instance, for slightly rotational ﬂows the functions g(ξ) may be
chosen as small corrections to the basic irrotational ﬂow described by the potential
ϕ.

5 Description in Lagrangian coordinates

To show that the system (1.4), (1.9)-(1.13) is indeed the integrated system of hy-
drodynamic equations, let us rewrite it in Lagrangian coordinates, when ﬁve vari-
ables x =

The system of ﬁve equations (5.10)-(5.12) is a system for ﬁve dependent variables
x, ϕ, η, considered as functions of four independent variables t, ξ. Five indeﬁnite
functions g, ρ0, S0 of ξ are determined from initial and boundary conditions.
In
particular, if there is no inﬂow of the ﬂuid and the initial values for x, ϕ, η are given
in the form

In the Lagrangian description the initial conditions (5.14) for the position of a par-
ticle labeled by ξ look quite reasonable. From physical point of view a necessity
of initial conditions for the particle position does not raise doubts. The system of
hydrodynamic equations (5.10)-(5.12) in the Lagrangian form looks as partly inte-
grated system. Indeed, the system (1.1)-(1.4) written in the independent Lagrangian
coordinates ξ for six dependent variables x = x(t, ξ), v = v(t, ξ) has the form

where Xα,β and ρ are functions of ξ, xα and xα,β
∂xα/∂ξβ which are deﬁned
by relations (5.1), (5.2), (5.13). The six order system (5.17) contains only two
indeﬁnite functions ρ0(ξ) and S0(ξ) describing initial values of density and entropy.
Initial values of velocity v(0, ξ) and position x(0, ξ) are given by initial conditions

≡

x(0, ξ) = ξ,

v(0, ξ) = vin(ξ)

(5.18)

The relation (5.7) is an integral of (5.17). It satisﬁes the equations (5.17) for any
functions g in virtue of equations (5.10)-(5.12), although this circumstance is not
evident directly.

Note that the curtailed system (1.1)-(1.3) cannot be written in the Lagrangian
form directly, because it does not contain any reference to Lagrangian coordinates
ξ. To introduce ξ, it is necessary to append equations (1.4). Then ﬁfth order system
(1.1)-(1.3) turns to the complete eight order system (1.1)-(1.4). Equations (1.1) and
(1.3) can be integrated on the basis of (1.4) in the form (1.9), (1.10). The remaining
equations (1.2), (1.4) constitute the sixth order system which can be written in the
Lagrangian form (5.17).

6 Incompressible ﬂuid

In the special case of the incompressible ﬂuid, it should set ρ = ρ0 =const in the
action (3.20) and introduce new variable

v = j/ρ0,

ρ0 = const

(6.1)

It is easy to verify that η = η(ξ), S = S0(ξ), and the last term of (3.20) can be
incorporated in the term jkgα(ξ)∂kξα. Thus, the action for the incompressible ﬂuid
looks as follows

In the case of a irrotational ﬂow, when v =

The relation (6.14) is valid for any ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid, but it is not an
integral. It is a deﬁnition. From point of view of the description in terms of hy-
drodynamic potentials ϕ, ξ, the relation (6.14) is a deﬁnition of the pressure p in
terms of dependent variables ϕ, ξ and the relation (6.3). From the viewpoint of the
curtailed system (6.8) the relation (6.14) is a deﬁnition of the function ϕ in terms
of variables v, p. Nevertheless, this deﬁnition is useful for a description of a slightly
rotational ﬂow, when the velocity v can be represented in the form

v =

7 Slightly Rotational Flow of Incompressible Fluid

It seems to be reasonable to consider a slightly rotational ﬂow as a small correction to
an eatablished irrotational ﬂow which can be eﬀectively calculated for a ﬂow around
diﬀerent bodies. Let u be a set of dependent variables, and dependent variables u0
describe an irrotational ﬂow. Let us represent a slightly rotational ﬂow in the form

u = u0 + εu1 + O(ε2),

1

ε

≪

(7.1)

where ε is a small formal parameter which is set to be equal to 1 after calculation.
It means that the quantities u1 are considered as small with respect to u0, u1/u0 =
O(ε)
1. Substituting (7.1) into dynamic equations and neglecting higher order
terms, one obtains linear equations for u1. Use of dependent variables v, p, satisfying
equations (6.8), leads to the following ﬁrst order approximation equations.

Both equations (7.2) and (7.3) are diﬃcult for a solution. Use of dynamic equations
(6.3), (6.6) and (6.7) for hydrodynamic potentials appears to be more eﬀective,
because for a ﬁxed velocity v =
ϕ0 equations (1.4) for ξ are equivalent to the
system of ordinary equations (1.6) which can be solved simply enough. Indeed, let
ϕ0 of the basic established irrotational ﬂow be known, and the
the velocity v =

relations

of (7.6) into equation (1.4) with v =
ϕ0. X can be interpreted as a ”distorted”
Cartesian coordinate in the direction along the basic ﬂow at inﬁnity. The distortion
of the coordinate X is chosen in such a way that the ﬂow were uniform.

8 Wave Function and Kinematic Spin of a Flow

There exists a special complex form of hydrodynamic potentials. In this form the
dynamic equation for the irrotational component of the ﬂow is very close to a linear
equation.

Idea of the transformation of hydrodynamic potentials is very simple. Let there
be an irrotational ﬂow v = b
φ of a compressible ﬂuid whose internal energy de-
pends only on ρ. Here b is a constant of dimensionality [b] = [L2T −1] which is

Equations (8.1) are imaginary and real components of (8.3). The second term in

lhs of (8.3) is linear. It corresponds to the convective term (v
contains the second order spatial derivative.
It is a price which is paid for the
linearity. As a result of the transformation (8.2) the nonlinearity is transmitted from
the kinematic term to the dynamic one. The kinematic nonlinearity is stronger,
than the dynamic nonlinearity, because the kinematic non-linearity is connected
directly with velocities, whereas the dynamic nonlinearity is coupled directly only
with forces and with accelerations. Thus, a displacement of the nonlinearity from
kinematic terms to dynamic ones weakens the nonlinearity (Rylov, 1989).

∇

The complex variable Ψ is used in quantum mechanics, where it is known as
the wave function. The fact that the Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function
describes a irrotational ﬂow of some ideal ﬂuid is well known (Madelung, 1926). For
such a ﬂuid the internal energy depends on ρ and
ρ. This internal energy has such
a form (E = b2(
ρ)2/2ρ2, b =
¯h/m) that rhs of (8.3) vanishes, and the equation
(8.3) becomes linear.

In the case of incompressible ﬂuid rhs of (8.3) becomes indeﬁnite due to additional

where the pressure p is considered as some function of time and position. The
situation is the same as in the case of equations (6.8), where the value of the pressure
p is determined only after the ﬂow is calculated.

The equation (8.4) looks as a linear equation. But in reality it is nonlinear
because of the nonlinear constraint (8.5).
In the case of a rotational ﬂow some
additional nonlinear terms appear. However if the ﬂow is slightly rotational, there

(8.5) could be considered as corrections to the irrotational ﬂow described by linear
dynamic equation.

n is such a natural number that equations (8.7) admit a solution. Here b is some
constant of dimensionality [b] = [L2T −1] which is introduced to make the quantities
wα and φ = ϕ/b dimensionless. The number n and the form of functions w depend on
the form of functions gα. But if wα, α = 1, 2, . . . n is a solution of (8.7), the variables
Ψα are some functions of ρ, ϕ, ξ, but not of their derivatives, although equations
(8.7), determining the transformation (8.6), contain derivatives of functions wα with
respect to ξ.

Note that the function Ψ considered as a function of independent variables

is very indeﬁnite in the sense that the same ﬂuid ﬂow may be described by diﬀerent
Ψ-functions. There are two reasons for such an indeﬁniteness. First, the functions
wα(ξ) are not determined uniquely by diﬀerential equations (8.7). Second, their
arguments ξ as functions of x are determined only to within the transformation
(1.16). Description of a ﬂuid in terms of the function Ψ is more indeﬁnite, than the

We shall refer to the quantity s deﬁned by (8.23) as the kinematic spin (k-spin)

ﬂow is equal to 0. The kinematic spin of the rotational ﬂow s
1/2. The k-spin
s = 1/2 is possible. Is a ﬂow of higher k-spin possible? This interesting question is
yet open. It seems to be connected with the complicated problem of knottedness of
vortex lines (Moﬀat, 1969; Bretherton, 1970).

As far as the ﬁeld g(ξ) is determined by the velocity ﬁeld vin(x), at the initial
moment, when ξ = x and g(x) = vin(x), the k-spin is determined by the initial
velocity vin(x). In particular, if the initial velocity can be represented in the Clebsch
form (4.31) with ηin = 0, the k-spin of such a ﬂow is equal to 1/2.

(9.17) contains only two arbitrary functions R1, ϑ1. The fact is that that (7.23)
describes arbitrary slightly rotational ﬂow, whereas the relation (9.17) describes
1/2, the six func-
slightly rotational ﬂow of k-spin 1/2. For any ﬂow of k-spin s
tions Aα, Bα, α = 1, 2, 3 reduce to two functions (for instance, A1, B1). But the
question about maximal value of k-spin is open now. On one hand, one can prove
(see, for instance, appendix to the paper by Eckart, 1960) that any vector ﬁeld g(x)

10 Two-dimensional irrotational ﬂow

Let us consider a ﬂow around a circular cylinder of a radius a. The cylinder axis
is supposed to coincide with the axis of z. The ﬂow is directed along the axis of
x. The basic irrotational ﬂow is described by the potential ϕ0, and by the stream
function ψ which are connected with the velocity components v0 =

Ix(ξ, η) is a single-valued function of arguments ξ2 and η2 (see details in Ap-
pendix). As it follows from (10.6), (10.17), (10.18) ∂∆/∂ξ is a single-valued function
of arguments ξ2 and η2, and ∆ has the form

∆(ξ, η) = ξB(ξ2, η2)

where B is a single-valued function of arguments ξ2 and η2. Then

where C1 and C2 are single-valued functions of arguments ξ2 and η2. It follows from
(10.28) and (10.34) that Fx also vanish in the ﬁrst order approximation Fx = O(ε2).
In other words, the D’Alamberian paradox takes place also in the case of the slightly
rotational stationary ﬂow.

11 Concluding remarks

Basing on the Jacobian technique and on the invariance with respect to the relabel-
ing group, one succeeded to integrate dynamic equtions for the ideal ﬂuid. Three
indeﬁnite functions g(ξ) of three arguments arise as a result of this integration.

37

These functions can be expressed vias initial and boundary conditions, and all es-
sential information on the ﬂuid ﬂow appears to be concentrated in the integrated
system of hydrodynamic equations.

Although the integrated system and the curtailed Euler system contain the same
number of equations, they diﬀer in the relation that the integrtated system takes
into account information contained in the Lin constraints, whereas the Euler system
ignores it. This diﬀerence is of no importance for irrotational ﬂows, when the ﬂuid
properties described by the Kelvin’s theorem (and Lin constraints) are inessential,
because they are fulﬁlled automatically. But this diﬀerence is essential in the case
of irrotational ﬂows.

One should expect that in the case of a compressible ﬂuid the hydrodynamic
potentials and the wave function will describe eﬀectively an interaction between the
acoustic waves and the slight ﬂuid vorticity.

Integration of dynamic equations generates two ways of descriptions: a descrip-
tion in terms of hydrodynamic potential (DTHP) and a description in terms of wave
function (DTWF). Both DTHP and DTWF take into account Lin constraints and
appear to be eﬀective in the case of slightly rotational ﬂows. There is a hope they
will appear to be eﬀective also in the case of strongly rotational ﬂows. Maybe, an
application of DTHP and DTWF will allow to formulate the turbulence problem
in a proper way. At any rate DTHP and DTWF seem to be more eﬀective for ro-
tational ﬂows, than the conventional description in terms of velocity, because they
take into account information contained in Lin constraints (and Kelvin’s theorem).
DTHP can take into account even initial and boundary conditions.

The integration of hydrodynamic equations and appearance of the ﬁeld g ac-
tivates the relabeling group.
Invariant subsets of this group can be used for a
classiﬁcation of the ﬂuid ﬂows. The ﬁeld g appears to be a tool for introducing
such attributes of the ideal ﬂuid as the wave function and the spin. These concepts
are new for conventional hydrodynamics, although they are well known in quantum
mechanics. In some cases it may be useful in the sense that quantum mechanical
methods can be used in hydrodynamics and vice versa.

The author is indebted to Prof. V.A.Gorodtsov for fruitful discussions which

were very useful for writing this paper.

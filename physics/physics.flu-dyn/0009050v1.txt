Abstract

The formation of singularities on a free surface of a conducting ideal ﬂuid in a strong
electric ﬁeld is considered. It is found that the nonlinear equations of two-dimensional
ﬂuid motion can be solved in the small-angle approximation. This enables us to show
that for almost arbitrary initial conditions the surface curvature becomes inﬁnite in a
ﬁnite time.

Electrohydrodynamic instability of a free surface of a conducting ﬂuid in an external
electric ﬁeld [1,2] plays an essential role in a general problem of the electric strength. The
interaction of strong electric ﬁeld with induced charges at the surface of the ﬂuid (liquid
metal for applications) leads to the avalanche-like growth of surface perturbations and, as a
consequence, to the formation of regions with high energy concentration which destruction
can be accompanied by intensive emissive processes.

In this Letter we will show that the nonlinear equations of motion of a conducting ﬂuid
can be eﬀectively solved in the approximation of small perturbations of the boundary. This
allows us to study the nonlinear dynamics of the electrohydrodynamic instability and, in
particular, the most physically meaningful singular solutions.

Let us consider an irrotational motion of a conducting ideal ﬂuid with a free surface,
z = η(x, y, t), that occupies the region −∞ < z ≤ η(x, y, t), in an external uniform electric
ﬁeld E. We will assume the inﬂuence of gravitational and capillary forces to be negligibly
small, which corresponds to the condition

E 2 ≫ 8π√gαρ,

where g is the acceleration of gravity, α is the surface tension coeﬃcient, and ρ is the mass
density.

The quantities η(x, y, t) ψ(x, y, t) = Φ|z=η are canonically conjugated, so that the equations

Let us assume |∇η| ≪ 1, which corresponds to the approximation of small surface angles.
In such a case we can expand the integrand in a power series of canonical variables η and ψ.
Restricting ourselves to quadratic and cubic terms we ﬁnd after scale transformations

t → tE −1(4πρ)1/2, ψ → ψE/(4πρ)1/2, H → HE 2/(4πρ)

the following expression for the Hamiltonian,

The equations of motion, corresponding to this Hamiltonian, take the following form,

2 h(ˆkψ)2 − (∇ψ)2 + (ˆkη)2 − (∇η)2i + ˆk(ηˆkη) + ∇(η∇η),

ηt − ˆkψ = −ˆk(ηˆkψ) − ∇(η∇ψ).

Subtraction of Eqs. (2) and (1) gives in the linear approximation the relaxation equation

(ψ − η)t = −ˆk(ψ − η),

whence it follows that we can set ψ = η in the nonlinear terms of Eqs. (1) and (2), which
allows us to simplify the equations of motion. Actually, adding Eqs. (1) and (2) we obtain
an equation for a new function f = (ψ + η)/2,

which corresponds to the consideration of the growing branch of the solutions. As f = η in
the linear approximation, Eq. (3) governs the behavior of the elevation η.

First we consider the one-dimensional case when function f depends only on x (and t)

and the integral operator ˆk can be expressed in terms of the Hilbert transform ˆH,

(4)

It should be noted that if one introduces a new function ˜f = ˆHf , then Eq. (4) transforms
into the equation proposed in Ref.
[4] for the description of the nonlinear stages of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

For further consideration it is convenient to introduce a function, analytically extendable

into the upper half-plane of the complex variable x,

Then Eq. (4) takes the form

v =

1
2

(1 − i ˆH)fx.

Re (vt + ivx + 2vvx) = 0,

that is, the investigation of integro-diﬀerential equation (4) amounts to the analysis of the
partial diﬀerential equation

vt + ivx + 2vvx = 0,

(5)

which describes the wave breaking in the complex plane. Let us study this process in analogy
with [5,6], where a similar problem was considered. Eq. (5) can be solved by the standard
method of characteristics,

v = Q(x′),

x = x′ + it + 2Q(x′)t.

(6)

(7)

where the function Q is deﬁned from initial conditions. It is clear that in order to obtain an
explicit form of the solution we must resolve Eq. (7) with respect to x′. A mapping x → x′,
deﬁned by Eq. (7), will be ambiguous if ∂x/∂x′ = 0 in some point, i.e.

Solution of (8) gives a trajectory x′ = x′(t) on the complex plane x′. Then the motion of the
branch points of the function v is deﬁned by an expression

1 + 2Qx′t = 0.

(8)

x(t) = x′(t) + it + 2Q(x′(t))t.

At some moment t0 when the branch point touches the real axis, the analiticity of v(x, t)
at the upper half-plane of variable x breaks, and a singularity appears in the solution of
Eq. (4).

Let us consider the solution behavior close to the singularity. Expansion of (6) and (7)

at a small vicinity of x = x(t0) up to the leading orders gives

v = Q0 − δx′/(2t0),

δx = iδt + 2Q0δt + Q′′t0(δx′)2,

where Q0 = Q(x′(t0)), Q′′ = Qx′x′(x′(t0)), δx = x− x(t0), δx′ = x′− x′(t0), and δt = t− t0.
Eliminating δx′ from these equations, we ﬁnd that close to singularity vx can be represented
in the self-similar form (δx ∼ δt),

vx = −h16Q′′t3

0(δx − iδt − 2Q0δt)i−1/2

.

As Re(v) = η/2 in the linear approximation, we have at t = t0

ηxx ∼ |δx|−1/2,

that is the surface curvature becomes inﬁnite in a ﬁnite time. It should be mentioned that
such a behavior of the charged surface is similar to the behavior of a free surface of an ideal
ﬂuid in the absence of external forces [5,6], though the singularities are of a diﬀerent nature
(in the latter case the singularity formation is connected with inertial forces).

Let us show that the solutions corresponding to the root singularity regime are consistent
with the applicability condition of the truncated equation (3). Let Q(x′) be a rational
function with one pole in the lower half-plane,

Q(x′) = −

is

2(x′ + iA)2 ,

(9)

which corresponds to the spatially localized one-dimensional perturbation of the surface
(s > 0 and A > 0). The characteristic surface angles are thought to be small, γ ≈ s/A2 ≪ 1.
It is clear from the symmetries of (9) that the most rapid branch point touches the real
axis at x = 0. Then the critical moment t0 can be found directly from Eqs. (7) and (8).
Expansion of t0 with respect to the small parameter γ gives

Taking into account that the evolution of the surface perturbation can be described by an
approximate formula

t0 ≈ Ah1 − 3(γ/4)1/3i .

(10)

we have for the dynamics of the characteristic angles

η(x, t) =

s(A − t)
(A − t)2 + x2 ,

γ(t) ≈

s

(A − t)2 .

Then, substituting the expression for t0 (10) into this formula, we ﬁnd that at the moment
of the singularity formation with the required accuracy

γ(t0) ∼ γ 1/3,

that is, the angles remain small and the root singularities are consistent with our assumption
about small surface angles.

In conclusion, we would like to consider the more general case where the weak dependence
of all quantities from the spatial variable y is taken into account. One can ﬁnd that if the
condition |kx| ≪ |ky| holds for the characteristic wave numbers, then the evolution of the
ﬂuid surface is described by an equation

[vt + ivx + 2vvx]x = −ivyy/2,

which extends Eq. (5) to the two-dimensional case.

An interesting group of particular solutions of this equation can be found with the help

of substitution v(x, y, t) = w(z, t), where

The equation for w looks like

z = x −

wt + iwz + 2wwz = −w/(2t).

It is integrable by the method of characteristics, so that we can study the analyticity violation
similarly to the one-dimensional case. Considering a motion of branch points in the complex
plane of the variable z we ﬁnd that a singularity arises at some moment t0 < 0 at the point
y0 along the y-axis. Close to the singular point at the critical moment t = t0 we get

ηxx|δy=0 ∼ |δx|−1/2,

ηxx|δx=0 ∼ |δy|−1.

This means that in the examined quasi-two-dimensional case the second derivative of the
surface proﬁle becomes inﬁnite at a single isolated point.

Thus, the consideration of the behavior of a conducting ﬂuid surface in a strong electric
ﬁeld shows that the nonlinearity determines the tendency for the formation of singularities
of the root character, corresponding to the surface points with inﬁnite curvature. We can
assume that such weak singularities serve as the origin of the more powerful singularities
observed in the experiments [7,8].

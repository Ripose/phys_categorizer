A magnetic ﬁeld rotating on the free surface of a ferroﬂuid layer is shown to induce considerable
ﬂuid motion towards the direction the ﬁeld is rolling. The measured ﬂow velocity i) increases with
the square of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude, ii) is proportional to the thickness of the ﬂuid layer, and
iii) has a maximum at a driving frequency of about 3 kHz. The pumping speed can be estimated
with a two-dimensional ﬂow model.

Polarizable ﬂuids can show a macroscopic reaction to
external electric or magnetic ﬁelds. While for most ﬂuids
the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld is fairly weak, colloidal
suspensions of magnetic particles – so called Ferroﬂuids –
do show a strong response particularly to static magnetic
ﬁelds [1]. If these ﬁelds are time dependent, a rich variety
of phenomena occurs. The internal rotation of the mag-
netization in an externally rotating magnetic ﬁeld gives
rise to nontrivial eﬀects, as summarized in a recent spe-
cial issue [2]. A particularly interesting example is the
driving of a macroscopic ﬂow by means of an external
rotating magnetic ﬁeld [3], because it should allow for a
very ﬁne tuning both of the speed and of the direction of
the ﬂow even in microscopic channels [4].

In this paper we present a novel magnetic ﬂuid [5] in an
open ﬂow geometry especially designed for a quantitative
comparison between the measured ﬂow velocity and its
theoretical estimation. It is scetched in Fig. 1. A circular

are driven with an ac-current with a phase diﬀerence of
90o, thus producing a rotating ﬁeld on the free surface of
the ﬂuid within the duct.

The characterization of the magnetic susceptibility of
the ﬂuid in the duct is of primary importance for the
pumping of the ﬂuid, as discussed in this paper. It has
been measured as a function of frequency of the exter-
nal oscillating azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld by means of a
pick-up coil placed into the liquid. Precisely speaking,
the magnetization was determined from the diﬀerence of
the signal detected by the pick-up coil in the empty and
the ﬁlled channel, under the inﬂuence of an oscillatory
azimuthal ﬁeld. The results are presented in Fig. 2. The
measured susceptibilities of this novel cobalt based ﬂuids
are fairly large compared to the more common magnetite
based ﬂuids. In particular, the large imaginary part of
the susceptibility is essential for the pumping action de-
scribed in this paper.

tion of the oscillating magnetic ﬁelds provided by the coils.

with a magnetic ﬂuid [5] with a viscosity of η = 5.4
·
10−3 Pa s. The orientation of the two coils producing the
rotating magnetic ﬁeld is also indicated in Fig. 1: One coil
is wrapped around this circular channel and provides a
magnetic ﬁeld in azimuthal direction, and the outer coil
produces the vertical component of the ﬁeld. Both coils

quency of the external alternating magnetic ﬁeld. Here the
real and imaginary parts are denoted by squares and circles,
respectively.

The pump does work: A rotating ﬁeld produced by the
coils leads to a motion of the ﬂuid in azimuthal direction
of the channel [6]. Its velocity is on the order of mm/s
and can thus be determined by visual inspection of tracer
particles swimming on its surface. The next observation

is also a qualitative one: When changing the phase dif-
ference between the ac-ﬁelds from +90o to
90o, the ﬂow
changes its sign. The ﬂow direction is such that the vor-
ticity of the ﬂow ﬁeld is locally parallel to the rotation
vector of the magnetic ﬁeld, i. e. the ﬂuid ﬂows towards
the direction the ﬁeld is rolling.

For quantitative measurements it is necessary to use
particles which are small compared to the channel width
(dandruﬀ, diameter about 1 mm). The velocity is de-
termined by taking the time a particle needs to travel a
few centimeters. The size dependence of these measure-
ments is taken into account by using the numerically cal-
cultated – roughly parabolic – velocity proﬁles (details
are described below), and by assuming that a ﬂoating
particle represents the mean speed with respect to its
diameter. A result obtained for a ﬁxed frequency of 1
kHz is presented in Fig. 3, where the maximal ﬂow ve-
locity within the channel is shown as a function of the
amplitude G0 of the driving external magnetic ﬁeld. The
velocity increases proportional to G2
0, as demonstrated
by the solid line, a parabola. Here we follow the nomen-
clature of Ref. [7], where the external magnetic far ﬁeld
is marked by G and the local one by H.

FIG. 3: Maximal velocity measured as a function of the ﬁeld
amplitude at a ﬁxed frequency of 1 kHz.

Having demonstrated this quadratic dependence of the
velocity on the magnetic ﬁeld, a ﬁrst approach to collapse
data obtained at diﬀerent ﬁelds is to introduce a reduced
velocity by dividing with the square of the external ﬁeld.
Another important inﬂuence determining the ﬂuid veloc-
ity is the height of the channel: It turns out that the
velocity is larger in bigger channels. This leads us to re-
duce the velocity also by dividing by the height L of the
duct. In order to get a dimensionless number one also has
to scale with the viscosity of the ﬂuid. Thus we deﬁne

as a reduced ﬂow velocity. Its measured values are pre-
sented as a function of the driving frequency of the ro-
tating magnetic ﬁeld in Fig. 4, for velocities obtained in

5 mm and a 2.5 mm

a 5 mm
2.5 mm duct. Both
measurements show a maximum of this velocity in the
range of 2 – 4 kHz.

frequency. Solid circles (open squares) are obtained in the 5

solid line represents the value expected on the basis of the
measurement of the ac-susceptibility.

The pumping action can be understood as a manifes-
tation of the magnetic stress acting on the magnetized
ﬂuid, as summarized in Ref. [8]. This assumption ex-
plains all qualitative features of the observation: as long
as the magnetization is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld
(which has been measured to be the case for our ﬂuid,
within a precision of 5 % for ﬁelds up to about 1500
Am−1), the stress must be proportional to G2 as demon-
strated in Fig. 3. If the frequency approaches zero, the
magnetization and the ﬁeld are parallel to each other, the
tangential stress is zero and thus the motion of the ﬂuid
stops. For ﬁnite frequencies the velocity is proportional
to the χ
component of the susceptibility, which must in-
crease linearly (to lowest order) with the frequency. For
higher frequencies, the imaginary part of the susceptibil-
ity χ
has a maximum at about 1 kHz, which explains
that the maximal pumping velocity is observed around
that frequency.

For the quantitative numerical calculation of the ﬂuid
velocity, we neglect the curvature of the duct.
In this
case, one can assume a primary ﬂow with only an az-
imuthal x-component of the ﬂuid velocity v(y, z), where
y corresponds to the radial and z corresponds to the ver-
tical coordinate. The velocity ﬁeld must fulﬁll the equa-
tion ∂2v
∂z2 = 0. The no-slip condition for the ﬂuid
at the bottom and the side walls of the duct than reads
v(y, 0) = v(0, z) = v(L, z) = 0, where L measures both
the width and the height of the square cross section of
the duct. The magnetic stress provides the boundary

Hx and Hz and the corresponding magnetization Mx and
Mz are not constant in our case, but depend both on time
and space. In the following, we will ﬁrst discuss the time
dependence of the magnetic stress and then the spatial
variation of the azimuthal and vertical components of the
magnetic ﬁelds.

To describe the time dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld
and the magnetization of the ﬂuid, we follow the proce-
dure and nomenclature of Ref. [7]. An external rotating
magnetizing force

inhomogeniety of the ﬁeld also leads to ﬁeld components
in the radial direction, but these do not contribute to a
stress in the azimuthal direction.

While both the magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetization
are rotating, the magnetic stress turns out to be time-
independent.

The azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬁeld can be

estimated on the basis of Ampere’s law as

Hx(y) = G0

d
2(y + Ri)

,

where d is the mean diameter of the duct and Ri its in-
ner radius. While this equation is exact for a very large
winding number of the coil, it is only approximately cor-
rect for our coil consisting of 50 windings, a relatively
small number like this is necessary to allow an obser-
vation of the ﬂuid ﬂow. The diﬀerence can be checked
by calculating the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld numerically
using Biot-Savart’s law. These calculations show a tiny
x-dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld due to the ﬁnite num-
ber of windings, but this deviation from the simpliﬁed
assumption turned out to be smaller than 1% for every
position along the surface of the duct.

The vertical component of the magnetic ﬁeld is slightly
more complicated. While it would be almost perfectly
homogenous on the surface of the empty duct, the mag-
netization of the ﬂuid inside the duct gives rise to a radial

dependence of Hz, which has to be obtained numerically
for a given value of the magnetic susceptibility χ of the
ﬂuid inside the duct. To do so, we introduce the magnetic
2φm = 0
scalar potential φm with
by a relaxation method [9]. The magnetization is then
calculated as M = χH. Fig. 5 shows the result of this
numerical calculation obtained for three diﬀerent suscep-
tibilities.

As a consequence of the magnetization shown in Fig. 5,
and the radial dependence of the azimuthal component
discussed above, the magnetic stress is not constant along
the radial position on the surface. The corresponding
boundary condition Eq. (3) can nevertheless be used for
a numerical solution of the Laplace equation for the ﬂow
ﬁeld. We get for the maximum ﬂuid velocity in the mid-
dle of the upper surface

β is a factor which depends both on the susceptiblity χ
and the aspect ratio a = Ly/Lz of the rectangular chan-
nel. In principle, we do not expect a simple analytical
expression for β. To make the data examination prac-
ticable, however, we use an analytic expression which
describes this factor with a precision of better than 1 %

The χ-dependence of the paramter β is only approxi-
mately captured by the ansatz of Eq. (5). This equation
would only be correct for a homogenous magnetization
of the ﬂuid, which would be described by some demagne-
tization factor N . In the case of our square cross section,
the magnetization – and the ensuing stress at the sur-
face of the ﬂuid – is not homogenous, as demonstrated
in Fig. 5. We thus extract an eﬀective demagnetization
factor Neﬀ by ﬁtting Eq. (4) to the numerically obtained
0.656,
velocity for diﬀerent values of χ. We obtain Neﬀ ≈
which seems realistic when comparing to N = 0.5 for the
case of a circular cylinder.

From Eqs. (1,4,5) we ﬁnally get the theoretical estima-

tion for the reduced velocity

and χ

The reduced velocity obtained from Eq. (6) is presented
in Fig. 4 as a solid line, with the values of χ
taken
from the measurements presented in Fig. 2. The agree-
ment between the measured velocities and the solid line
is on a 20% level. This can partly be attributed to the
limited accuracy of the measurement procedure, which
is indicated by the error bars in Fig. 4. The systematic
deviations between the data and the theoretical curve
are believed to reﬂect the precision of the simplifying as-
sumptions going into the consideration presented above.
For example, the inﬂuence of the shape of the meniscus
of the ﬂuid adds a three-dimensional complication to the
problem, whose inﬂuence on the maximal pumping speed
is hard to estimate. Moreover, it should be noted that
magnetic ﬂuids are not perfectly stable both in their mag-
netic susceptibility and their viscosity, which might add
to the small mismatch between the expectation based on
the measurement of the susceptibility and the measured
velocity. Finally, taking into account the small ampli-
tude of the magnetic ﬁeld, any magnetoviscous eﬀects
have been neglected for the calculations.

In summary, the pump presented here works well and
has an interesting potential especially in small geometries
where a mechanical driving of the ﬂow is not possible.
More importantly, it does seem safe to conclude that the
ansatz of a magnetic stress driven motion captures the
essence of this pump on a quantitative level.

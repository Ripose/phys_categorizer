Abstract

The ﬁrst quantitative calculation of the position of the hydraulic

jump was carried out a few years ago by Bohr et.al. Since this is

the only calculation of the jump, we have analysed it from a slightly

diﬀerent point of view. Our results are similar to those of Bohr et.al.

If a vertical jet of ﬂuid impinges on a horizontal surface and spreads out

radially, then at a certain radius one observes a sudden jump in the height

of the ﬂuid[1-4].It is a familiar observation,seen in the kitchen sink everyday,

but it has been a diﬃcult system to deal with.The question that is normal

to ask is that given the volumetric ﬂow rate (or the Reynolds number of

the impinging ﬂow) can we predict the position and magnitude of the jump

which is known as the hydraulic jump.The ﬁrst attempt to provide a concrete

answer to this question was undertaken by Bohr,Dimon and Putkaradge[5]

and took place only a few years ago.

Continuity of mass ﬂux and momentum ﬂux is possible at any radius and

thus one more condition is needed to determine the radius of the jump.This

could be the energy ﬂux but that is generally diﬃcult to handle.It was shown

by Bohr et.al. that introducing viscosity does help in setting up a criterion

for ﬁnding the position of the jump. Since that was the ﬁrst attempt to set

up a quantitative calculation, we believe that it is worthwhile to look at the

problem from a simpler standpoint.

The central simpliﬁcation in the calculation, a simpliﬁcation also used by

Bohr et.al., is the assumption that the radial velocity ’u’is greater than the

vertical velocity ’w’,while the variations with respect to the vertical direction

(ie.’z’) is far more important than the radial variations .With this in mind,

the equation of continuity becomes:

The momentum ﬂow equuation(Navier Stokes equation), for the radial com-

ponent,is:

At this point, we need to make a statement about the vertical proﬁle f (η).A

This relation is very similar to that found by Bohr et.al. The diﬀerence in the

prefactor comes from the diﬀerence between the choice of the z-dependence

of the radial velocity.Bohr et.al. chose to work with a z-averaged velocity

while we have demonstrated the jump by studying the radial ﬂow velocity at

the free surface.

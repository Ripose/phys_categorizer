The probability density function of single-point velocity ﬂuctuations in turbulence is studied
systematically using Fourier coeﬃcients in the energy-containing range. In ideal turbulence where
energy-containing motions are random and independent, the Fourier coeﬃcients tend to Gaussian
and independent of each other. Velocity ﬂuctuations accordingly tend to Gaussian. However, if
energy-containing motions are intermittent or contaminated with bounded-amplitude motions such
as wavy wakes, the Fourier coeﬃcients tend to non-Gaussian and dependent of each other. Velocity
ﬂuctuations accordingly tend to non-Gaussian. These situations are found in our experiment of a
rough-wall boundary layer.

INTRODUCTION

Suppose that single-point velocity ﬂuctuations u(x) are
measured repeatedly in stationary turbulence over the
range 0 ≤ x < L. If the sampling interval is much greater
than the eddy turnover timescale, these measurements
serve as independent realizations of the turbulence. Each
of them is expanded into a Fourier series as

where 2πn/L = kn is the wave number. Batchelor [1]
assumed that the Fourier coeﬃcients an and bn are sta-
tistically independent of each other and applied the cen-
tral limit theorem to their sum. This theorem ensures
that the probability density function (PDF) of a sum of
many independent random variables tends to Gaussian,
at least within a few standard deviations around the av-
erage [2, 3]. It was concluded that velocity ﬂuctuations
tend to Gaussian, being consistent with experimental and
observational data of turbulence that were available at
that time.

However, recent measurements revealed the presence of
velocity ﬂuctuations that tend to non-Gaussian. Sreeni-
vasan and Dhruva [4] obtained long data of atmospheric
turbulence at 35 m above the ground. Their data yield
the ﬂatness factor Fu = hu4i/hu2i2 = 2.66, where the

tained Fu ≃ 2.85 in turbulent jets. For these results,
there has been no explanation.

Therefore, although single-point velocity ﬂuctuations
are fundamental in describing turbulence, the mecha-
nism that determines their PDF is uncertain. We sys-
tematically study velocity ﬂuctuations in a laboratory
rough-wall boundary layer, a representative turbulent
ﬂow with various applications, e.g., the atmosphere near
the ground. With an increase of the distance from the
wall, velocity ﬂuctuations are found to change from sub-
Gaussian (Fu < 3) to Gaussian, and to hyper-Gaussian
(Fu > 3). This behavior is discussed using PDFs of the
Fourier coeﬃcients and correlations among them.

II. CONDITION FOR GSAUSSIANITY

This section serves as a summary of conditions for ve-
locity ﬂuctuations to be approximately Gaussian. It is
assumed that the turbulence is not only stationary but
also homogeneous in the x direction. The data length
is set to be much larger than the correlation length
|hu(x + δx)u(x)i|dδx/hu2i. Then an average taken
lc =
over the realizations is equal to the corresponding aver-
age taken over the x positions.

R

Velocity ﬂuctuations of turbulence are dominated by
Fourier coeﬃcients in the energy-containing range. Since
the data length is large, there is a suﬃcient number of
Fourier coeﬃcients for the central limit theorem to be
applicable. Velocity ﬂuctuations tend to Gaussian if the
Fourier coeﬃcients are random and independent. This
is expected for ideal turbulence where energy-containing
motions are random and independent. Although tur-

bulence always contains small-scale coherent structures,
e.g., vortex tubes [6], their contribution to velocity ﬂuc-
tuations is as small as the energy ratio of the dissipation
range to the energy-containing range.

The central limit theorem is not applicable to a sum of
variables if few of them dominate over the others [2, 3].
ni + hb2
For example, if the energy spectrum En = ha2
ni
is proportional to kα
n with α < −1, Fourier coeﬃcients
at the smallest wave numbers dominate the velocity ﬂuc-
tuations. They do not necessarily tend to Gaussian [7].
Nevertheless, the energy spectrum is relatively ﬂat in the
usual energy-containing range, where the power law kα
n
is not a good approximation. We previously assumed
that the central limit theorem is not applicable to the
sum of Fourier coeﬃcients in any turbulence [8], but this
assumption was wrong.

Fourier coeﬃcients of velocity ﬂuctuations also tend
to Gaussian if turbulence is made of random and inde-
pendent motions [8, 9, 10]. The Fourier coeﬃcient an is
obtained as

regarded as random variables. Their amplitudes are the
same because the segment size L/m exceeds the wave-
length L/n. They are nearly independent because adja-
cent integrations depend on each other only at the ends.
Then an tends to Gaussian as a consequence of the cen-
tral limit theorem. This discussion is not applicable to
Fourier coeﬃcients an and bn for n ≃ 1. They are nev-
ertheless small and do not contribute to velocity ﬂuctua-
tions if the data length L is suﬃciently large, because of
the universal trend En → 0 in the limit kn = 2πn/L → 0
[1]. We are able to assume safely that all the Fourier
coeﬃcients are Gaussian.

The central limit theorem oﬀers no information about
the tails of the PDF of a sum of variables. Only when
the sum (minus its mean) has been divided by the square
root of the number of the variables, the Gaussian approx-
imation holds at the tails [2, 3]. Although statistics such
as the ﬂatness factor mainly reﬂect the core of the PDF,
the tails that are signiﬁcantly far from Gaussian could
exist and aﬀect the statistics. One example is signiﬁcant
contamination with a bounded-amplitude motion, e.g.,
u(x) ∝ sin(x), the PDF of which does not have tails. Ve-
locity ﬂuctuations tend to sub-Gaussian, e.g., Fu = 3/2
for u(x) ∝ sin(x) [7]. The Fourier coeﬃcients that corre-
spond to the bounded-amplitude motion also tend to sub-
Gaussian [11]. Another example is signiﬁcant intermit-
tency, where velocity ﬂuctuations tend to hyper-Gaussian

[12]. The Fourier coeﬃcients also tend to hyper-Gaussian
because some of the integrations
..., and
L
(m−1)L/m ... dx are enhanced over the others. Since the
Fourier coeﬃcients are linear functions of velocity ﬂuctu-
R
ations, sub- and hyper-Gaussianities of the velocity ﬂuc-
tuations yield sub- and hyper-Gaussianities of the Fourier
coeﬃcients, respectively, and vice versa. We expect that
this relation could approximately exist even in the case
of mutually dependent Fourier coeﬃcients as long as the
dependence is weak.

III. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was done in a wind tunnel of the Mete-
orological Research Institute. As shown in Fig. 1, we use
the coordinates x, y, and z in the streamwise, spanwise,
and ﬂoor-normal directions. The corresponding wind ve-
locities are u, v, and w. We take the origin x = y = z = 0
on the tunnel ﬂoor at the entrance to the test section.
The test section had the size δx = 18 m, δy = 3 m, and
δz = 2 m. A boundary layer was made by placing blocks
over the entire ﬂoor of the test section. The blocks had
the size δx = 6 cm, δy = 21 cm, and δz = 11 cm. The
spacings of the adjacent blocks were δx = 70 cm and
δy = 80 cm. We set the in-coming wind velocity to be 20
m s−1. The boundary layer was well developed at x >
∼ 10
m.

The u and v or u and w components of the wind ve-
locity were measured using a hot-wire anemometer with
an X-type probe. The wires were made of tungsten, 5
µm in diameter, 1.0 mm in eﬀective length, 1.4 mm in
separation, oriented at ±45◦ to the streamwise direction,
and operated at the temperature of 280◦C. The measure-
ment positions were at x = 10 m and z = 0.05–1.00 m.
The signal was low-pass ﬁltered with 24 dB/octave and

at x = z = 1 m are shown. The latter reﬂects the me-
chanical and electric noise, which is well below the tur-
bulence signals.

R

Throughout the boundary layer, velocity ﬂuctuations
are almost isotropic [Fig. 2(b)]. Although velocity ﬂuctu-
ations in a smooth-wall boundary layer are anisotropic,
the anisotropy is reduced over roughness [14]. The shear-
stress velocity is almost constant at z ≃ 0.14–0.40 m
[Fig. 2(c)]. Below and above this constant-stress sub-
layer, there are the roughness sublayer and the outer
sublayer, respectively, where turbulence is aﬀected by the
roughness or the outer laminar ﬂow. The logarithmic law
that corresponds to the constant stress is unclear in the
proﬁle of the mean streamwise velocity [Fig. 2(a)] be-
cause our constant-stress sublayer is relatively thin and
there is uncertainty in deﬁning the eﬀective origin for the
logarithmic law.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Figure 3(a) shows the ﬂatness factors Fu, Fv, and Fw
as a function of the height z. Figure 3(b) shows the
skewness factors Su = hu3i/hu2i3/2, Sv, and Sw. The
ﬂatness factors are close to 3 at z <
∼ 0.40 m. As the height
is increased above z ≃ 0.40 m, the ﬂatness factors begin
to increase. They have pronounced peaks at z ≃ 0.90 m.
The skewness factors are also signiﬁcant at z >
∼ 0.40 m,
except for the v component that is free from the shear
of the boundary layer. Similar results were obtained in
previous works [15, 16].

We focus on the v component, which is best suited to
our analysis. The range of ﬂatness factor is widest. The
dependence on the height z is simple. At z <
∼ 0.40 m,
the PDF is sub-Gaussian. At z >
∼ 0.40 m, the PDF is
hyper-Gaussian. Only the v component at z ≃ 0.40 m
exhibits simultaneously the Gaussian values F = 3 and
S = 0.

Figure 4(a) shows the energy spectrum En for the
v component at z = 0.05, 0.36, and 0.70 m. Fig-

where np corresponds to the wave number knp of the
En peak. These quantities were obtained by dividing the
data into segments of 215 points. We regarded them as in-
dependent realizations of turbulence, applied the Fourier
transformation individually to them, and calculated aver-
ages over them at each of the wave numbers. The energy
spectrum was obtained using the Welch window function.
Since this and other usual window functions were found
to aﬀect signiﬁcantly the ﬂatness factor or mode-mode
correlation, we were forced to obtain them by appending
the inverted sequence to each sequence of the segments.
Any method to remove eﬀects of discontinuity at the ends
of a data segment modiﬁes the data and thereby aﬀects
some of the statistics. Our present method is not an
exception but happens to have no serious eﬀect on the
statistics of our interest.

Velocity ﬂuctuations at z = 0.36 m are Gaussian
[Fv = 3.00; Fig. 3(a)]. Throughout the wave numbers,
the ﬂatness factor of the Fourier coeﬃcient is close to
Gaussian [Fig. 4(b)], and the mode-mode correlation is
absent [Fig. 4(c)]. Thus the Fourier coeﬃcients are Gaus-
sian and independent of each other. The height z = 0.36
m is near the upper edge of the constant-stress sublayer
and also near the middle of the entire boundary layer.
We consider that eddies of various sizes and strengths
pass the probe randomly and independently.

Velocity ﬂuctuations at z = 0.05 m are sub-Gaussian
[Fv = 2.51; Fig. 3(a)]. At around the peak of the energy
spectrum En, the ﬂatness factor of the Fourier coeﬃ-
cient is sub-Gaussian [Fig. 4(b)]. This sub-Gaussianity

of the Fourier coeﬃcients is associated with that of ve-
locity ﬂuctuations (Sec. II). Although the former is less
signiﬁcant than the latter, the mode-mode correlation is
negative [Fig. 4(c)]. This is also associated with the sub-
Gaussianity of velocity ﬂuctuations. Even if the Fourier
coeﬃcient at the En peak has a large amplitude, its eﬀect
to velocity ﬂuctuations tends to be weakened by small
amplitudes of the Fourier coeﬃcients at nearby wave
numbers, as compared with a noncorrelation case.

The mode-mode correlation shown in Fig. 4(c) is
merely a representative example. Similar negative cor-
relations are found for other pairs of Fourier coeﬃcients
at around the energy peak. It is possible to have more
than two Fourier coeﬃcients that are negatively corre-

lated with each other if the absolute values of the corre-
lation coeﬃcients are small.

The height z = 0.05 m is in the roughness sublayer. A
plausible explanation is that turbulence is contaminated
with bounded-amplitude motions due to wavy wakes of
the roughness. The amplitudes are required to be in a
bounded range because velocity ﬂuctuations and their
Fourier coeﬃcients are sub-Gaussian (Sec. II). The indi-
vidual motions are required to contribute to a range of
wave numbers, possibly through the presence of spatial
structures, because there are mode-mode correlations.

Velocity ﬂuctuations at z = 0.70 m are hyper-Gaussian
[Fv = 14.82; Fig. 3(a)]. Throughout the wave num-
bers, the ﬂatness factor of the Fourier coeﬃcient is hyper-
Gaussian [Fig. 4(b)]. This is associated with the hyper-
Gaussianity of velocity ﬂuctuations (Sec. II). The mode-
mode correlation is positive [Fig. 4(c)]. If the Fourier co-
eﬃcient at the En peak has a large amplitude, its eﬀect to
velocity ﬂuctuations is strengthened by large amplitudes
of the Fourier coeﬃcients at nearby wave numbers.

The height z = 0.70 m is near the outer edge of the
boundary layer, where turbulence is intermittent [12, 17].
There are only eddies that have been ejected from the
lower heights. Actually, the skewness factors of the u
and w components are negative and positive, respectively
[Fig. 3(b)]. The eddies intermittently pass the probe
and enhance velocity ﬂuctuations. They are accordingly
hyper-Gaussian. The intermittency is also responsible for
the hyper-Gaussianity of the Fourier coeﬃcients (Sec. II).
The presence of spatial structures is responsible for the
presence of mode-mode correlation. It should be noted
that, since turbulence is not space ﬁlling, this intermit-
tency is regarded as contamination of turbulence with a
laminar ﬂow.

The hyper-Gaussianity of velocity ﬂuctuations in the
outer sublayer has been known to be an intermittent phe-
nomenon for a long time, readily understood in the space
domain [12]. Their Fourier coeﬃcients in the wave num-
ber domain are not so useful but have interesting proper-
ties as in the cases of sub-Gaussian and Gaussian velocity
ﬂuctuations.

Figure 5 summarizes behaviors of the Fourier coeﬃ-
cients as a function of the height z: (a) the wave number
knp of the peak of the energy spectrum, (b) the ﬂatness
factor of the Fourier coeﬃcient Fn, and (c) the mode-
mode correlation Cnnp (n 6= np). The latter two quan-
tities are medians around knp within 2±1knp . Since sta-
tistical uncertainty is not insigniﬁcant, the shorter data
with 8 × 106 points are denoted by the smaller symbol.
With an increase of the height, the peak wave number de-
creases because energy-containing eddies become larger
[18]. The behaviors of the ﬂatness factor and mode-
mode correlation are in accordance with the behavior of
velocity ﬂuctuations. At z <
∼ 0.40 m, velocity ﬂuctua-
tions are sub-Gaussian. The Fourier coeﬃcients are sub-
Gaussian and exhibit negative mode-mode correlations.
At z >
∼ 0.40 m, velocity ﬂuctuations are hyper-Gaussian.

The PDF of single-point velocity ﬂuctuations in tur-
bulence is not universal but reﬂects energy-containing
motions. We studied velocity ﬂuctuations using their
Fourier coeﬃcients in the energy-containing range.
In
ideal turbulence where energy-containing motions are
random and independent, the Fourier coeﬃcients tend to
Gaussian and independent of each other. Velocity ﬂuctu-
ations tend to Gaussian. This is the case at around the
middle of a rough-wall boundary layer, where eddies of

various sizes and strengths pass the probe randomly and
independently. However, if turbulence is contaminated
with bounded-amplitude motions such as wavy wakes,
the Fourier coeﬃcients tend to sub-Gaussian and their
amplitudes are correlated negatively. Velocity ﬂuctua-
tions tend to sub-Gaussian. This is the case in the lower
part of a rough-wall boundary layer, where contamina-
tion with wavy wakes of the roughness is signiﬁcant. If
turbulence is intermittent or contaminated with a lami-
nar ﬂow, the Fourier coeﬃcients tend to hyper-Gaussian
and their amplitudes are correlated positively. Velocity
ﬂuctuations tend to hyper-Gaussian. This is the case in
the upper part of a rough-wall boundary layer, where
turbulence is not space ﬁlling and eddies intermittently
pass the probe.

We previously studied velocity ﬂuctuations in grid tur-
bulence [8]. At small distances from the grid, turbulence
is developing. There are bounded-amplitude motions due
to wavy wakes of the grid. The PDF of velocity ﬂuctua-
tions tends to sub-Gaussian. At intermediate distances,
turbulence is fully developed. The PDF tends to Gaus-
sian. At large distances, turbulence is decaying. There
remain only strong eddies. They intermittently pass the
probe. The PDF tends to hyper-Gaussian. These results
for grid turbulence are consistent with our present results
for boundary-layer turbulence.

Sreenivasan and Dhruva [4] obtained Fu = 2.66 in the
atmospheric boundary layer. The exact observational

6

condition is unknown to us, but the ﬂow at the measure-
ment position z = 35 m could be aﬀected by wavy wakes
of the ground roughness. The observed sub-Gaussianity
could be attributable to possibly bounded amplitudes of
these wakes.

Velocity ﬂuctuations tend to sub-Gaussian in direct
numerical simulations of homogeneous, isotropic, station-
ary turbulence [19, 20, 21]. Since the simulations were
done under forcing over narrow ranges of the smallest
wave numbers, the energy spectra are steep and close
to the power law kα
n with α < −1. The observed sub-
Gaussianity could be attributable to the forced motions
that dominate the velocity ﬂuctuations [7, 21] (see also
Sec. II). Thus these numerical results are not inconsistent
with our experimental results where the energy spectrum
is relatively ﬂat in the energy-containing range [Fig. 4(a)].
It is of interest to study such numerical data in the same
manner as in the present work.

ness are deﬁned not with the maximum value ˆU of the
mean streamwise velocity but with the velocity of the
in-coming ﬂow. However, since our wind tunnel was not
capable of adjusting its ceiling to set the pressure gra-
dient to be zero, the mean streamwise velocities at the
highest positions were greater than the in-coming veloc-
ity. We thereby used the maximum value of the mean
streamwise velocity obtained at z = 0.90 m.

the exact peak wave number, which is unnaturally large
possibly due to statistical uncertainties. We instead used
the wave number that corresponds to the second greatest
value of the energy spectrum. This wave number is 60%–
80% of the peak wave number.

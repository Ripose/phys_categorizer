When a capillary is inserted into a liquid, the liquid will rapidly ﬂow into it. This phenomenon,
well studied and understood on the macroscale, is investigated by Molecular Dynamics simulations
for coarse-grained models of nanotubes. Both a simple Lennard-Jones ﬂuid and a model for a
polymer melt are considered.
In both cases after a transient period (of a few nanoseconds) the
meniscus rises according to a √time-law. For the polymer melt, however, we ﬁnd that the capillary
ﬂow exhibits a slip length δ, comparable in size with the nanotube radius R. We show that a
consistent description of the imbibition process in nanotubes is only possible upon modiﬁcation of
the Lucas-Washburn law which takes explicitly into account the slip length δ. We also demonstrate
that the velocity ﬁeld of the rising ﬂuid close to the interface is not a simple diﬀusive spreading.

context, also the ﬁlling of silicon dioxide nanochannels
[4] and of rolled-up InAs/GaAs tubes [5] has found
great interest. Related ﬂuid ﬁlling phenomena occur
when viscous ﬂuid fronts propagate into porous media
by spontaneous imbibition [6]. On macroscopic scales,
a basic understanding of such capillary rise processes
exists for almost a century [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. How-
ever, the applicability of the resulting concepts on the
nanoscale has been the subject of a recent controversy
[13, 14, 15].
In particular, the conditions under which
the Lucas-Washburn equation [7, 8] holds are debated.
This equation predicts a √t law for the rise of the ﬂuid
meniscus H(t) in the capillary with time t,

ter a (nanoscopically small) transient time (Zhmud et al.
t2 when the liquid
[11] suggest an initial behavior H(t)
is accelerated by the capillary forces). However, Mastic
et al. [13] ﬁnd H(t) rising slower than linear with time,
even for t
1ns, from Molecular Dynamics (MD) sim-
ulation of a simple Lennard-Jones (LJ) ﬂuid. They sug-
gest to slightly correct Eq. (1), replacing θ by a dynamic
contact angle θ(t). In contrast, a study of a model for
decane molecules in a carbon nanotube [14, 15] yielded
a simple linear behavior H(t)
t over a wide range of
times, leading to the conclusion that ﬁlling of nanotubes
by ﬂuids does not obey the Lucas-Washburn equation.
Experiments so far are inconclusive on this issue, since
the existing work [16, 17] deals only with pores that are
at least 1 µm wide. Moreover, in narrow nanotubes an
eventual slip at the hydrodynamic boundaries might af-

fect the balance of forces by reducing the viscous drag at
the tube wall.

The aim of the present letter is to help clarifying the
problem of capillary ﬁlling in narrow nanotubes. We
present simulations of a generic model, varying both the
ﬂuid-wall interaction and the nature of the ﬂuid (sim-
ple LJ particles vs. melt of short polymer chains, re-
spectively). Providing independent estimates for all the
parameters entering Eq. (1), we are able to perform a
decisive test of Eq. (1). Since a ﬂuid ﬂowing into a
capillary is a nonequilibrium process, we avoid use of
a strictly “microcanonical protocol” of our MD simula-
tions, unlike [14, 15]. Using a dissipative particle dy-
namics (DPD) thermostat [18], which does not disturb
the hydrodynamic interactions due to its Galilean invari-
ance, we maintain strict isothermal conditions, in spite of
the heat produced due to the friction of the ﬂowing ﬂuid.
In the real system, the walls of the nanoﬂuidic device
would achieve the thermostating, of course.

Model description - The snapshot picture, Fig. 1, il-
lustrates our simulation geometry. We consider a cylin-
drical nanotube of radius R = 10, whereby the cap-
illary walls are represented by atoms forming a trian-
gular lattice with lattice constant 1.0 in units of the
liquid atom diameter σ. The wall atoms may ﬂuctu-
ate around their equilibrium positions at R + σ, sub-
ject to a ﬁnitely extensible non-linear elastic (FENE) po-

(cid:3)
no penetration of liquid particles through the wall while
in the same time the wall atoms mobility corresponds to
the system temperature. In all our studies we use a cap-
illary length Hmax = 55. The right end of the capillary is
closed by a hypothetic impenetrable wall which prevents
liquid atoms escaping from the tube. At its left end the
40 reservoir for
capillary is attached to a rectangular 40
the liquid with periodic boundaries perpendicular to the
tube axis. Although the liquid particles may move freely
between the reservoir and the capillary tube, initially,
with the capillary walls being taken distinctly lyophobic,
these particles stay in the reservoir as a thick liquid ﬁlm
which sticks to the reservoir lyophilic right wall. The ﬁlm
is in equilibrium with its vapor both in the tube as well
as in the left part of the reservoir. At a time t = 0, set
to be the onset of capillary ﬁlling, we switch the lyopho-
bic wall-liquid interactions into lyophilic ones and the
ﬂuid enters the tube. Then we perform measurements
of the structural and kinetic properties of the imbibi-
tion process at equal intervals of time. As a simulation
algorithm we use the velocity-Verlet algorithm [19] and

The capillary ﬁlling is studied for two basic cases: (i)
a simple ﬂuid interacting via LJ potential with ǫ = 1.4
and σ = 1.0, and (ii) a non-Newtonian ﬂuid (a polymer
melt) consisting of short chains of length N = 10. The
non-bonded interaction is given by a LJ potential with
ǫ = 1.4 and σ = 1.0 whereas the bonded forces between
chain monomers result from a combination of FENE and
LJ potentials with ǫ = 1.0 [21]. In both cases the liquid-
wall interaction is given by a LJ potential with strength
ǫwl which is varied over a broad range so as to change the
wetting characteristics of the system. All interactions
are cut oﬀ at rcut = 2.5σ. By varying the interaction
strengths and the thermostat parameters, one can change
the dynamic properties of the test ﬂuids in a wide range.
The total number of liquid particles is 25000 while those
forming the tube are 3243.

Simulation results

- Typical data for the time evolu-
tion of the advancing front of the LJ ﬂuid penetrating
into the pore are shown in Fig. 2. Choosing a constant
time interval (∆t = 300) between subsequent proﬁles in
Fig. 2, it is already obvious that the interface position
advances into the capillary slower than linear with time!
The proﬁles ρ(z) at late times become distinctly nonzero
far ahead of the interface position (near the right wall at
z = 55 where the capillary ends), due to a ﬂuid mono-
layer attached to the wall of the capillary: this precursor
advances faster then the ﬂuid meniscus in the pore cen-
ter, but also with a √t law (see below).

Fig. 3a shows that the time evolution of the meniscus
height H(t) depends very sensitively on the strength of
the wall-ﬂuid interaction (or the contact angle θ, respec-
tively): for ǫW S = 0.6 and 0.8 only a small number of
ﬂuid particles enter the capillary (since θ > 90 for these

FIG. 4: Velocity ﬁeld around the moving meniscus for ǫwl =
1.4. Velocities are averaged within a two-dimensional grid,
always ﬁxed at z = 0 to the actual moving meniscus position
and renormalized according to the current meniscus speed.
The inset shows the LJ-ﬂuid density proﬁle in the vicinity of
the meniscus. The interface position is denoted by a yellow
line.

We have also tested whether the results are aﬀected by
possible simulation artefacts due to insuﬃcient thermo-
stating conditions. In fact, a slower capillary rise occurs
if one uses a “Langevin thermostat” (i.e., an ordinary
friction and random noise term acting on all particles),
which violates hydrodynamics [23]. A similar result ap-
plies if the wall atoms are rigid rather than mobile [22].
But even in these cases the data still follows the √t-law,
and also changing details such as the above parameters
chosen for the FENE potential of the wall atoms does
not matter. From the velocity proﬁles near the moving
meniscus Fig. (4) it is evident that care is needed for the
temperature equilibration of such non-equilibrium MD
simulations of transient phenomena. The ﬂow is laminar
behind the interface, parallel to the walls of the capillary,
with the velocity largest in the tube center and going to
zero close to the walls. Thus our simple ﬂuid exhibits
evidently stick boundary conditions. However, in the
interface the velocity ﬁeld bends over into a direction
along the interface, and occasionally particles evaporate
into the gas region. This ﬂow pattern shows that the
√t must not be confused with a simple diﬀusive
H(t)
spreading, of course!

Comparison with the Lucas-Washburn equation - For
a test of Eq. 1, it is crucial to also estimate the prefactor,
of course, to prove that the √t growth is not just a mere

in the nanosecond range), and then a behavior compat-
ible with Eq. 1 is veriﬁed. The initial deviation from
this law seen in Fig. 3 is not related to the “dynamic
contact angle” [13]: this would produce a curvature of
opposite sign in Fig. 3. However, in the marginal case
ǫW L = 1.0 a pronounced deviation from Eq. (1) occurs:
this curve could be (approximately) ﬁtted to a linear re-
lation, H(t)
t. It is possible that the results of Supple
and Quirke [14, 15] just correspond to such a marginal
case. Finally we emphasize that even the height of the
precursor foot (topmost curve in Fig. 3a) advances with
a H(t)

√t law.

To test whether the capillary rise behavior of polymers
diﬀers from that of Newtonian ﬂuids, the penetration of
a melt of short ﬂexible polymers (above model (ii)) is
shown in Fig. 3b. But apart from a general slowing down
(attributable to the higher viscosity of the polymer melt),
the behavior exhibits the same √t-law.

A consistency check of our results with Eq.(1) is per-
formed for the case of complete wetting, cos(θ) = 1,
1.4 where the data prac-
which corresponds to ǫwl ≥
tically collapse on a single curve. For the simple LJ-
ﬂuid with the tube radius R = 10 one obtains a slope
H(t)/√t = 0.76
0.02 which agrees perfectly with the
measured meniscus velocity, cf. Fig. 3a. For the polymer
melt, in contrast, Eq.(1) predicts a slope of 0.20 which is
considerably less than the observed slopes in Fig. 3b. To
clarify this discrepancy we performed MD simulations
of steady state Poiseuille ﬂow of identical melt subject
to external force g comparable to the capillary driving
force. The radial variation of axial velocity indicates a
clear slip-ﬂow behavior, cf. inset in Fig. 3b, with a slip
length of δ
2.7 which cannot be neglected when com-
pared to the tube radius R = 10. The importance of
slip-length in processes in the nanoscale range has been
emphasized earlier by Barrat and Bocquet [26]. In the
present case the existence of a slip length δ can be eas-
ily accounted for in the Lucas-Washburn result, Eq.(1), if
one notes that, according to the deﬁnition of a slip length,
the drag force under slip-ﬂow conditions in a tube of ra-
dius R and slip length δ is equal to the viscous drag force
for a no-slip ﬂow in a tube of eﬀective radius R + δ, that
is, to 4ηd(H(t)/(R + δ))2/dt. In both cases the capillary
driving force remains unchanged, 2γ cos(θ)/R. Thus one
derives a modiﬁed Lucas-Washburn relationship:

In summary, we have shown that ba-

takes into account the slip length δ. Our new result, Eq.

within the framework of the general √t law even in those
cases when slip-ﬂow cannot be neglected.

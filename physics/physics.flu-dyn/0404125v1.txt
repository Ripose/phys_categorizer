Abstract

A dynamic α model for the isotropic incompressible LANS-α equations is proposed in this investiga-
tion. To derive this model, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are Helmholtz-ﬁltered at the grid
and test ﬁlter levels. A Germano type identity is derived by comparing the ﬁltered subgrid scale stress
terms with those given in LANS-α equations. Considering a constant value of α and averaging in the
homogenous directions of the ﬂow results in a nonliner equation for the parameter α, which determine
the variation of α in the non-homogeneous directions or time. This nonlinear equation is solved by an
iterative technique. Consequently, the parameter α is calculated during the simulation instead a pre-
deﬁned value. The initial tests of this model for the isotropic homogenous forced and decaying turbulence
show that energy decay and energy spectra are predicted accurately by the dynamic LANS-α equations.
An improvement in the results with dynamic LANS-α model over the coresponding calculations with a
ﬁxed α value for isotropic homogenous turbulence has also been observed. To exhibit the application
prospecting of dynamic LANS-α model in wall bounded turbulenc simulation, a priori test of this model
for turbulent channel ﬂows is initially performed in this study. By a priori test, the parameter α is found
to change in the wall normal direction. Near the boundary, the length scale α is seen to depend on the
distance to the wall, and away from the boundary, α keeps an approximate constant value. As a result,
the turbulent ﬂow is divided into two regions: the constant α region away from the boundary and near
wall region. A correct behavior of subgrid scale stress in near wall region is seen to be captured by this
dynamic α model. Thus, the current priori tests show a promising application of this model in wall
bounded turbulent ﬂow simulation.

Introduction

Turbulent ﬂow plays a very important role in many engineering applications. Although many experimental
and theoretical studies have signaﬁcantly helped to increase our physical understanding, a comprhensive
and predictive theory of turbulent ﬂows has not yet been established. Therefore, the prediction of turbulent
ﬂow relies heavily on simulation strategies. The current widely used turbulence simulation strategies includ

Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) equation, large-eddy simulation(LES) and direct numerical simu-
lation(DNS), ranked from low to high by their computation cost and from high to low by their precissions in
capturing turbulence structure. Because LES can predict large scale of turbulence at much less computation
cost, the severe Reynolds number restriction in DNS is largely alleviated by LES. Usually the Smagrinsky
model which assumes a linear relation between subgrid scale stress and mean ﬂow strain tensors is widely
used for SGS stress modeling. However, this model is very ﬂow dependent and the Smagrinsky coeﬃcient
may vary in diﬀerent ﬂow. In order to improve large-eddy simulations for wall bounded ﬂow, Germano [1]
introduced a dynamic subgrid scale modeling strategy with Smagrinsky model. In this dynamic model the
Smagrinsky coeﬃcient is not constant any more and will vary in both space and time. The Smagrinsky
coeﬃcient is obtained by Germano identity which built a relation between subgrid scale stress at grid ﬁlter
and test ﬁlter. Where test ﬁlter possesses much larger ﬁlter width than the gird ﬁlter. This model provides
for the proper asymptotic behavior of the stresses near the wall withou ad hoc damping function. Large-eddy
simulations of transitional and turbulent channel ﬂow using this model were very encouraging.

More recently, Holm et al [2, 3] introduced a α models for the mean motion of ideal incompressible ﬂu-
ids by Lagrangian Averaged approach. Unlike the traditional averaging or ﬁltering approach used for both
RANS and LES, where the Navier-Stokes equation are averaged, the Lagrangian averaging approach is based
on averaging at the level of the variational principle from which the Navier-Stokes equations are derived.
That is, the Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes(LANS-α) equation for self-consistent mean ﬂuid dynamics
are derived by applying temporal averaging procedures to Hamilton’s principle for an ideal incompressible
ﬂuid ﬂow. The resulting mean ﬂuid motion equation are obtained by using Euler-Poincare variational frame-
work [2,3] . Therefore, these equations possess conservation laws for energy and momentum, as well as Kelvin
circulation theorem. Because the LANS-α equations are averaged over small spatial scales which are smaller
than a priori speciﬁed scale α, the behavior of the LANS-α solution approximates the behavior of NS well
to spatial scales of order α, while truncating the energy spectrum for scales smaller than α. This averaging
or ﬁltering is done without adding the viscosity, but by a nonlinear dispersion from the large scales. The
numerical simulations of LANS-α equations performed by Chen et al [4] and Mohseni et al [5] for isotropic
homogenous turbulence showed the good fetures of this α model in reproducing large scales of turbulence.
However, like Smagrinsky model in LES, the LANS-α model is also ﬂow dependent. The value of α may
vary in diﬀerent ﬂows in order to attain a proper subgrid scale stress modeling. By comparing solutions of
Camassa-Holm equations and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent channel and pipe
ﬂow, Chen et al [6–8]found that length scale α is dependent on the distance from the wall in near wall
region. While in the region away from the boundary, α keeps almost a constant value. Their work indicate
that given a proper α as function of distance from boundary, Camassa-Holm equations could provide for an
accurate solution for wall bounded turbulent ﬂow.

In this investigation, a dynamic α model is developed for isotropic incompressible turbulence. The es-
sense of our approach is similar to the dynamic LES equations using a Germano identity. The incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations are Helmholtz-ﬁltered at the grid and test ﬁlter levels. A Germano type identity is
derived by comparing the ﬁltered subgrid scale stress terms with those given in LANS-α equations. Con-
sidering a constant value of α and averaging in the homogenous directions of the ﬂow results in a nonliner
equation for the parameter α, which determine the variation of α in the non-homogeneous directions or time.
This nonlinear equation is solved by an iterative technique. Consequently, the parameter α is calculated
during the simulation instead a pre-deﬁned value. An initial test has been performed with this model for
isotropic homogenous forced and decaying turbulence simulations by Zhao and Mohseni [9]. To exhibit the
application prospecting of this dynamic LANS-α model in wall bounded turbulenc simulation, a priori test
of this model for turbulent channel ﬂows is performed in current study. In next section of this paper, we will
ﬁrst give a derivation of dynamic LANS-α model. Then a brief description of numerical method is given in
the third section. This was followed by some numerical results and discussion in the fouth section. Finally
some conclusions are made in last section.

The LANS-α equations are given by(see [3, 10] for a derivation)

+ (¯u · ∇)u − α2(∇¯u)T · ∆¯u = −∇p + µ∆u

where ¯u is deﬁnes as

¯u = (1 − α2∆)

−1u

These equations are obtained by averaging the Euler equation in Lagrangian representation over rapid

ﬂuctuations whose amplitudes are of order α. These equations can equivalently be represented by

∂¯u
∂t

+ (¯u · ∇)¯u = −∇p + µ∆¯u − ∇ · τ (¯u)

∇ · ¯u = 0

where p is the modiﬁed pressure and τ (¯u) is the subgrid scale stress tensor deﬁned as

This subgrid scale stress is in fact the momentum ﬂux of the large scales caused by the action of smaller,
unresolved scales. It is known that the subgrid scale stress can also be derived by ﬁltering approach. For
incompressible NS equation

For convinence, we call the ﬁrst ﬁlter as grid ﬁlter and the second ﬁlter as test ﬁlter. Applying above

Because ˜α =

scale than the grid ﬁlter. Figure 1 shows the relative positions of grid ﬁlter scale α and test ﬁlter scale ˜α on

the energy spectrum. In order to model the subgrid scale stress in good accuracy, both grid ﬁlter scale and
test ﬁlter scale must locate whithin the inertial sub-range of energy spectrum.

The dynamic α model given in equation (23) can be applied either in isotropic homogenous turbulence
or in wall bounded turbulence. For isotropic homogenous turbulence, the α is regarded as constant in whole
space and only changes in time. The averaging will also be taken in whole space. For wall bounded ﬂow,
the ﬂow is assumed to be homogenous in streamwise and spanwise directions, and a large velocity gradient
exists in wall normal direction. The α value can be regarded as constant at each homogenous layer in wall
normal direction and will change at diﬀerent layers. The α value at each layer will also change with time
development. So equation (23) is solved at each homogenous layer and the averaging is also performed at
this layer.

3 Numerical Method

The numerical method used for isotropic homogenous turbulence simulation in this study is based on a
standard parallel pesudospectral scheme with periodic boundary conditions. The spatial derivatives are
calculated in the Fourier domain, while the nolinear convective terms are computed in the physical space.
The ﬂow ﬁelds are advanced in time in physical space using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. To eliminate
the alias errors, the two third rule is used so that the upper one third of wave modes is discarded at each
stage of the fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. The computations are performed in a periodic cubic box of
side 2π. The initial ﬂow ﬁled was solenoidal, and the initial pressure ﬂuctuations were obtained from the
solution of incompressible Possion equation. The initial velocity ﬁeld for each case was divergence free and
constructed from an energy spectrum of the form

E(k) ∼ k4exp[−2(k/kp)2]

(26)

The value of kp corresponds to the peak in the energy spectrum.

A priori test is performed in a channel with a length of 8π in streamwise, 4π in spanwise and a unit channel
height. The DNS database in [12] has been used for a priori test. The spatial derivatives are calculated
by pesudospectral method in streamwise and spanwise directions and by Chebychev-tau technique in wall
normal direction. These methods have been used for DNS simulations of channel ﬂow in Kim et al [13]
and Moser et al [14]. A Helmholtz type grid and test ﬁlter are applied in both streamwise and spanwise
directions. No explicit ﬁlters are applied in wall normal direction. To solve nonlinear equations (21) and (23),
α is assumed to be constant in streamwise and spanwise direction. The equations are solved by iteration
method. Because at the wall, both mean ﬂow and turbulence ﬂow will be zero, the nonlinear equations (21)
and (23) may encounter the singularity problems. So in the iterations, we choose a starting location with

5

several points away from the wall surface. The α is regarded as converged when the diﬀerence of its values
at two consecutive iterations is less than 10−5. The converged α value will be used as the initial value for
the iterations at the next point.

4 Results and Discussion

In order to test the dynamic LANS-α model to determine the accuracy with which the model predicts
the SGS stress, both decaying and forced isotropic homogenous turbulence simulation with this model are
performed. The results by the dynamic model will be compared with those by ﬁxed α model and direct
numerical simulation. The LANS-α and dynamic LANS-α simulation will be performed based on a 643
grid which corresponds to 483 precission after dealiasing and direct numerical simulation will be performed
on a 1283 grid which corresponds to 853 precission after dealiasing. After that, a priori test of this model
with DNS data of channel ﬂow is performed to test the behavior of this model in predicting SGS stress for
wall bounded turbulence simulation. In current study, we used the channel ﬂow DNS data obtained by del
´Alamo et al [12]. The turbulence Reynolds number based on wall friction velocity is Reτ = 550 and the
computational grid is 1536 × 257 × 1536 in streamwise, wall normal and spanwise direction respectively.

4.1 Decaying and forced isotropic homogenous turbulence simulations

A decaying isotropic homogenous turbulence with initial Taylor Reynolds number Reλ = 72 which corre-
sponds to a computational Reynolds number Re = 300 and an initial energy spectrum peaked at kp = 4 has
been simulated. The eddy turn over time for this case is about τ = 0.9. Figure 2 shows the time development
of α value at β = 0.8 ∼ 1.2. It is observed that α values experience a sharp decreasing from a relatively large
value at the initial time at all β. After approximately one eddy turn over time, α reaches a realatively steady
state and shows slow increasing again after another 2 − 3 eddy turn over time. The fast increasing of α value
at later time is perhaps due to the lack of computation precission in reproducing energy containing scales
when the turbulence energy decays to a lower limitation so that the integral scales grow to large enough to
be comparable to the size of computational box.

energy decaying and energy spectrum are well predicted by the dynamic LANS-α model. If we look at time
development of α values in Figure 2 again refering to the energy spectrum in Figure 4, we ﬁnd that the
resolved smallest scale α always locates within the inertial sub-range of energy spectrum at all β values
when the turbulence is fully developed. According to the numerical simulations of LANS-α equations by
Chen et al [4] and Mohseni et al [5], we know that only when the smallest resolved scale α locates within or
close to the initial subrange can the α model predicts an accurate subgrid scale stress. So it is shown that
this dynamic α model can attains appropriate α values. In Figure 3 and Figure 4 it is found that at β = 0.8,
the dynamic α model attains the best prediction on the energy decaying and energy spectrum. Both large
scale and small scale energy spectrum are well predicted at both t = 2τ and t = 6τ . It can also be observed
that energy decaying and energy spectrum at β = 0.8 are much closer to corresponding DNS results than
those obtained by α = 0.15 simulation.

Forced isotropic turbulence in a periodic box can be comsidered as one of the most basic numerically
simulated turbulent ﬂows. Forced isotropic turbulence is achieved by applying isotropic forcing to low wave
numerber modes so that the turbulent cascade develops as the statistical equilibrium is reached. Statistical
equilibrium is signiﬁed by the balance between the input of kinetic energy through the forcing and its output
through the viscous dissipation. The numerical forcing of a turbulent ﬂow is usually referred to the artiﬁcial
addition of energy to the large scale velocity components in the numerical simulation. In this study, we
adopted a forcing method used in Chen et al [4] and Mosheni et al [5] where wave modes in a spherical shell
|K| = k0 of a certain width are forced in such a way that the forcing spectrum follows Kolmogorov’s −5/3
scaling law

where ˜fi and ˜ui are Fourier transform of the forcing vector fi and velocity ui. N is the number of wave
modes that are forced. δ is the energy injection rate. This is done in order to obtain as long as a range of
near inertial behavior as possible. This type of forcing ensures that the energy spectrum assumes inertial
range scaling starting from the lowest wave modes and thus an extended inertial range is artiﬁcally created.
In current run, we choose k0 = 2 and δ = 0.1. The initial Taylor Reynolds number is Reλ = 415 and initial
energy spectrum peaked at kp = 1. The eddy turn over time is about τ = 3.8.

Figure 5 shows the time development of α values at β = 0.8 and β = 1.0. It is observed that α values
experience a sharp decreasing from a large value at the initial time within one eddy turn over time and reach
a completely steady state after about 5 eddy turn over time. This means that the turbulence has already
reached an equllibrium status after 5 eddy turn over time. It can also be observed that the steady α value
has a scale in the inertial sub-range.

the ﬂow reaches an equllibrium status. The energy spectra by dynamic LANS-α model at both β = 0.8 and

4.2 A priori test of turbulent channel ﬂow

A priori test of the dynamic LANS-α model were carried out to determine the accuracy with which the
model predicts the SGS stress and dissipation. The test were performed using the DNS database of del
´Alamo et al [12] for turbulent channel ﬂow. The turbulence Reynolds number based on wall friction velocity
is Reτ = 550 and the computational grid is 1536 × 257 × 1536 in streamwise, wall normal and spanwise
direction respectively, which corresponds to an actual computation precission of 1024 × 257 × 1023 after
dealiasing. The proﬁle of mean velocity non-dimensionalized by the wall-shear velocity is shown in Figure

intensities proﬁles from wall to middle channel in a global coordinates. A maximal turbulence intensity in

By some numerical trails, we found that to attain a uniquely determined α by solving nonlinear equation
(23), β value must be in an approximate range of 0.8 ≤ β ≤ 1.2. Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the variation
of α with the distance from wall in global and wall coordinates respectively by priori test. The comparisons
of α curves are also made in these two coordinates at β = 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2. It is observed in Figure 11 that
α experiences a sharp increasing in a layer from Y + = 0.0 to Y + = 100, which includes viscous sublayer
and buﬀer layer. Where α approaches zero at the wall surface since the turbulence intensities are zero there.
While from Y + = 100 to channel middle, α keeps an approximate constant value. The variation of β has
little inﬂuence on α curves near the wall. And away from the wall, α will show small change at diﬀerent β.

At β = 1.2, α keeps much more steady value away from the wall. As a result, the turbulent channel ﬂow
is divided into two regions: a near wall region which includes viscous sublayer and buﬀer layer, where α is
a function of distance from the wall, and a constant α region which include log layer and out layer. It is
also observed that in the near wall region, α keeps an approximate log relation with the distance from the
wall in wall units. This relation can be useful in computing α value in near wall region in the wall bounded
turbulence simulations by LANS-α equations.

To demonstrate the accuracy of the dynamic LANS-α model in predicting subgrid scale stresses, the
modeled and exact SGS stresses are plotted as a function of distance from wall in Figure 12 and Figure
13 at β = 1.2. Figure 12 shows the isotropic component < τ11 > and Figure 13 shows the shear stress
component < τ12 >. Where < · > stands for averaging in streamwise and spanwise directions. It is seen
that the modeled SGS stresses show good agreement with exact SGS stresses in near wall region. The SGS

stresses attain zero value at the wall surface and channel middle plane, and reach maximal values within
the wall layer. This means that the correct behavior of SGS stresses have been captured without a ad hoc
damping function. In Figure 14, the modeling dessipation < ε > is also compared with exact dissipation.
It is observed that the modeled dissipation shows some larger magnitude than the exact one, but it still
represents the correct behavior of dissipation in near wall region. At the same time, we also found that SGS
stresses and dissipation are very insensitive to the change of β value. All these priori test results exhibit a
good feature of dynamic LANS-α model in wall bounded turbulence simulations.

5 Conclusions

A dynamic LANS-α model has been proposed based on the similar idea of Germano identity in current
investigation. A nonlinear equation was derived to attain an optimal α value dynamically for subgrid
scale stress modeling in LANS-α equation. The α value is obtained by solving this nonlinear equation
iteratively. The initial numerical tests are performed based on this dynamic LANS-α model for decaying
and forced homogenous isotropic turbulence. A priori test of this model with DNS data of channel ﬂow
is also performed to test the behavior of this model in predicting SGS stress for wall bounded turbulence
simulation. The simulation results of both decaying and forced isotropic homogenous turbulence show that
the α values experience a fast transient period from a large value at initial time to a relatively steady small
value when the energy cascade is buit up. After this transient period, α value will keep a relatively steady
time development. The energy decaying and energy spectrum with dynamic LANS-α model at an appropriate
β value show much better agreement with direct numerical simulation results than those obtained by ﬁxed
α value simulations. By a priori test with channel ﬂow DNS data, the parameter α is found to change in
the wall normal direction. Near the boundary, the length scale α is seen to depend on the distance to the
wall, and away from the boundary, α keeps an approximate constant value. As a result, the turbulent ﬂow is
divided into two regions: the constant α region away from the boundary and near wall region. In near wall
region, α keeps an approximate log relation with the distance from the wall. A correct behavior of subgrid
scale stress and dissipation in near wall region is seen to be captured by this dynamic α model. Thus, the
current priori tests show a promising application of this model in wall bounded turbulent ﬂow simulation.

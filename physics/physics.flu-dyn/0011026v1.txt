In many industrial processes, such as pouring a liquid
or coating a rotating cylinder, air bubbles are entrapped in-
side the liquid. We propose a novel mechanism for this phe-
nomenon, based on the instability of cusp singularities that
generically form on free surfaces. The air being drawn into
the narrow space inside the cusp destroys its stationary shape
when the walls of the cusp come too close. Instead, a sheet
emanates from the cusp’s tip, through which air is entrained.
Our analytical theory of this instability is conﬁrmed by ex-
perimental observation and quantitative comparison with nu-
merical simulations of the ﬂow equations.

Air bubbles are a ubiquitous presence in ﬂuid ﬂow, ap-

1

pearing when pouring a liquid into a beaker, when beat-
ing an egg, or in river streams. This aeration is often
desirable, for example to promote chemical reactions [1],
yet in many industrial processes entrainment of air bub-
bles is detrimental to the quality of the product, render-
ing the ﬂow unsteady. For example, it is the single most
important factor limiting the speed at which paints or
coatings can be applied to a solid surface [2,3]. But in
spite of its importance, no general understanding of air
entrainment exists, except for the rather special circum-
stance that the free surface conspires to enclose an air
bubble from all sides, as was recently found for a dis-
turbed water jet [4].
Instead, here we argue that the
presence of cusp singularities on the free surface results
in a generic mechanism for air entrainment.

In recent years it has emerged that free surfaces are
rather susceptible to the formation of sharp tips or cusps
[3,5–7]. This is true in particular for viscous ﬂuids, where
shear stresses are strong compared with surface tension
forces [7]. Examples are drop impact on a surface [10],
jets impinging on a pool of liquid [1], and the coating
of a pre-wetted solid cylinder [3]. Once the air enters
these narrow passages, the gas ﬂow serves to destroy the
original structure to let the air penetrate below the sur-
face. What is surprising about this novel mechanism is
that the forces the gas ﬂow exerts on the ﬂuid plays the
crucial role, even though the viscosity of the air may
be smaller by many orders of magnitude than that of
the ﬂuid. Other instabilities may occur at a three-phase
boundary, for example when the solid to be coated is dry,
a problem studied in [2,8]. In the presence of surfactant,
still another mechanism for the instability of a cusp has
been suggested by Siegel [9].

For purposes of illustration, consider the particular ex-
ample of a two-dimensional cusp that forms when a thin
stream of a viscous silicone oil is poured into a container
of the same ﬂuid. Since the falling liquid drags other
ﬂuid away from the surface, a dip is produced around
the ﬂuid stream. Increasing the ﬂow rate above a critical
value, this dip is no longer smooth, but a singular point
on the surface is approached with two vertical tangents.
A cross section of this cusped proﬁle is shown as a black
silhouette in Fig.1a, the outer wall of the free surface end-
ing in a vertical tangent at the cusp point. For clarity,
the lighting is chosen such that the free surface appears
opaque, so the falling jet is only indicated symbolically
to guide the eye, but not visible directly.

Increasing the ﬂow rate still further, there is a second
critical value where the stationary proﬁle of Fig.1a ceases
to exist and a sheet of air shoots out from the tip of the

cusp. The bottom picture shows this dynamical structure
1/60th of a second after the cusp has become unstable.
A thin air sheet now forms the wall of a transparent ﬂuid
cylinder. The details of this dynamical structure, such
as the bell-shaped opening at its lower rim, is not the
subject of this paper, but only the instability of the static
shape leading to it. The cylinder eventually grows to
about ten times the length shown, and is unstable to
the formation of bubbles at its lower end, so the liquid
pool quickly becomes contaminated by bubbles of a broad
variety of sizes.

FIG. 2. The local shape of the cusp, cut perpendicular to
the sheet of air. The variable y is the distance from the tip.

Since the air sheet near the cusp is of micron size, the
curvature with which it is wrapped around the impinging
jet is of no consequence and the cusp can be viewed as
a two-dimensional object.
In this spirit, Joseph et al.
[6] performed experiments with a two-dimensional ﬂow
produced by two counter-rotating cylinders submerged
below the surface of a very viscous liquid. If the cylinders
are placed suﬃciently close to each other, a cusp forms in
a symmetrical position between the cylinders [7]. Letting
the distance between the rollers going to zero, Jeong and
Moﬀatt found a family of exact solutions to this problem,
obeying the local scaling form

h(y) = κ−3/4H(yκ1/2),

(1)

where κ is the curvature at the tip (see Fig.2). The struc-
ture of the solution (1) is typical for ﬂows near singular-
ities [11–13], which involve very small scales. Physically
(1) means that the shape of the interface is independent
of scale, up to a rescaling of the axes. The other crucial
property of singularities is that their shape is universal,
i.e. independent of the particular type of ﬂow that gener-
ates the cusp. Thus our theory, based on the stability of
such a singular structure, will be equally general. Indeed,

2

Antonovskii [14] discovered yet another class of exact so-
lutions, but where the cusp is formed on the surface of a
circular bubble. A local analysis reveals that the scaling
function

H(ξ) = paξ(ξ + p2/a)

is identical to the one in [7] except for a diﬀerent value
of the numerical constant a, conﬁrming the expectation
that the ﬂow on small scales is universal, independent of
the particular features of the driving ﬂow.

In all solutions, the tip curvature κ grows exponen-
tially with the capillary number Ca = ηU/γ, where η
is the ﬂuid viscosity, γ the surface tension, and U is a
typical velocity scale of the external ﬂow. Thus as the
strength of the driving ﬂow increases relative to the sur-
face tension, the size of the tip may easily reach micro-
scopic dimensions [7] if the eﬀect of the air is not taken
into account. Without it, stable solutions are thus pre-
dicted to exist for all capillary numbers, in disagreement
with experiment. Moﬀatt suggested [15] that this is be-
cause all previous analyses neglect the viscosity λη of the
air being drawn into the cusp by the ﬂow u(0)
y (y) parallel
to the cusp surface. The air entering a narrow space and
having to escape again generates a so-called lubrication
pressure plub(y) inside the cusp, whose derivative with
respect to the distance y from the cusp is

lub = 3ληu(0)
p′

y (y)/h2(y)

(2)

by Reynolds’ theory [16]. Since the cusp narrows like
h(y) ∼ y3/2, the lubrication pressure pushes the walls
apart according to plub ∼ y−2, just as it would keep sep-
arated to narrowly spaced mechanical parts.
Figure 3 proves by direct numerical simulation that
this is enough to destroy the stationary solution found
for λ = 0. We use a boundary integral code [17,18], opti-
mized to resolve the cusp between two merging cylin-
ders [19], neglecting the ﬂuid inertia.
Starting from
Antonovskii’s solution with κ0 = 104, λ is increased in
steps of 2.5· 10−5, pushing the interface forward,but only
every fourth proﬁle is shown. At λ = 5.5 · 10−4, no more
stationary solution is found, but instead air enters the
ﬂuid forming a narrow sheet, as seen in Fig. 1 and ob-
served in earlier experiments [20] An important conse-
quence is that in a physically correct description which
incorporates the eﬀect of the air (or some other gas at-
mosphere), molecular dimensions are never reached, so
continuum theory remains valid throughout [21].

To describe the inﬂuence of the air analytically, note
that the extra transverse velocity ﬁeld u(λ)
x (y) generated
by the air pressure can simply be added to u(0)
x (y) as
given in [7], since Stokes’ equation is linear. Geometri-
cally, the cusp looks like a two-dimensional crack enter-
ing the ﬂuid, a problem well studied in linear elasticity
[22]. Borrowing Muskhelishvili’s result, we can now write
u(λ)
x (y) as

p(y ′)m(y ′/y)dy ′,

FIG. 3. A boundary integral simulation of a bubble in the
ﬂow proposed by Antonovskii for ǫ = 5 and Ca = 0.0992 [14].
The undisturbed bubble radius is used to non-dimensionalize
all lengths in the problem. As λ is increased, the tip is pushed
forward, but becomes narrower at a given y. The lowest pro-
ﬁle is non-stationary. The inset shows the critical value of λ
beyond which there is no more stationary solution for a given
curvature.

But our free-surface problem is of course non-linear,
since the free surface has to follow the streamlines of the
ﬂow, which are modiﬁed by u(λ)
x . Namely, the inverse
slope of the interface is

h′ = (u(0)

x + u(λ)

x )/u(0)
y ,

(4)

x and u(0)
y

are known [7] and u(λ)
x

where u(0)
is calculated
from h as outlined above. Note that while u(0)
x has to
point inward towards the cusp, u(λ)
results from the lu-
x
brication pressure and points away from the cusp. Thus,
at a given distance y from the tip, h′ becomes smaller
and the channel narrows. Owing to (2) the lubrication
pressure is increased, further increasing u(λ)
x , so this non-
linear feedback eventually destroys the cusp solution, as
seen in Fig. 3.

It is extremely useful to recast equations (2)-(4) in the
scaling variable ξ = yκ1/2, cf. (1). First, from (4) and
since u(0)
is a constant up to logarithmic corrections, u(0)
x
y
must scale like κ−3/4κ1/2 = κ−1/4. From (2) plub is esti-
mated as plub ∼ λκ, and thus u(λ)
x ∼ λκ1/2 from integrat-
ing once. The two opposing velocities become compara-
ble at some critical value of the parameter r = λκ3/4.
Thus (2)-(4) can be recast in similarity variables, leading

(3)

to an integral equation for the correction Hc(ξ) to the
unperturbed surface proﬁle H(ξ):

Hc(ξ) = −

y (ξ/κ1/2) Z ∞

u(0)
y (η/κ1/2)M (η/ξ)
[H(η) + Hc(η)]2 dη (5)
where M ′(η) = m(η). It is a simple matter to solve (5)
numerically, giving increasingly large corrections Hc(ξ)
to the proﬁle as r is raised. Since Hc is negative, the
denominator in the integrand of (5) decreases, leading
to a further increase in the absolute magnitude of the
correction, in accordance with the qualitative argument
given above. Owing to this nonlinear feedback, a solu-
tion ceases to exist above a critical value of r, which has a
weak dependence on κ due to the logarithmic dependence
of u(0)
y on its argument. Hence for the ﬂow parameters of
Fig. 3, we predict that the cusp becomes unstable when
the curvature reaches a critical value of κcr ≈ 0.45λ−4/3.
This approximation is hardly distinguishable from the re-
sult of the full solution of (5), which in the insert of Fig.
3 is seen to be in good agreement with numerical simula-
tions for various values of λ. Because of the relationship
between curvature and capillary number, this translates
into the anticipated critical value Cacr above which sta-
tionary solutions are no longer found. At low viscosities,
the capillary number never even reaches the critical value
for the formation of a cusp, so an unperturbed water jet
does not entrain air [4].

In conclusion, we have incorporated the eﬀect of an
outer ﬂuid like air into the theoretical description of a
cusp. This allows for the ﬁrst quantitative description of
air entrainment through surface singularities. A descrip-
tion of the resulting sheet of air and its stability remains
to be done. Other future challenges include the analysis
of its close three-dimensional relatives, namely jet forma-
tion out of bubble tips “tip-streaming” [23], Taylor cones
“electric jets” [24], or spouts formed by planar interfaces
“selective withdrawal” [25].

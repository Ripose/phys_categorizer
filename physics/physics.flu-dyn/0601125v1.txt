Abstract

The physical foundation of the main mathematical concepts in the nonstandard analysis

theory of turbulence are presented and discussed. The basic fact is that there does not exist

the absolute zero ﬂuid-volume. Therefore, the corresponding physical object to the absolute

point is just the uniform ﬂuid-particle. The ﬂuid-particle, in general, corresponds to the

monad. The uniform ﬂuid-particle corresponds to the uniform monad, the nonuniform

ﬂuid-particle to the nonuniform monad. There are two kinds of the diﬀerentiations, one

based on the absolute point, another based on the monad. The former is adopted in the

Navier-Stokes equations, the latter in the fundamental equations, the closed forms are the

equations (7)-(11) in this article, in the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence. The

continuity of ﬂuid is shown by virtue of the concepts of the ﬂuid-particle and ﬂuid-particle

in lower level. The character of the continuity in two cases, the standard and nonstandard

analysis, is presented in the paper. And the diﬀerence in the discretization between the

Navier-Stokes equations and the equations (7)-(11) is pointed out too.

Key words: the monad, the point, the uniform and nonuniform point, the continuity of

ﬂuid, the ﬂuid-particle, the ﬂuid-particle in lower level

PACS: 47.27.Ak

In papers [1] [2] [3], one new description of turbulence is presented and the preliminary

discussion on some important and key concepts about the description is given too. The new

1

description of turbulence is called as Nonstandard Analysis Theory of Turbulence(NATT). In

this article, we will have a discussion on the reasonability of the basic mathematical concepts

in the NATT. Some of these concepts are in being in the standard analysis, but they have new

meanings in the NATT. And the others are not in being in the standard analysis at all.

Obviously, the reasonability of these mathematical concepts originates in the physical founda-

tion of them. The mathematical logic is important, but should not be ﬁrst.In the mathematical

logic,the introduction of these concepts should only meet a demand for being not contradictory.

These mathematical concepts are: the point, the structure of point, the point-average, the

inﬁnitesimal, the monad, the new derivative,the continuity of ﬂuid, etc.. We will discuss their

physical meanings in order to show the reasonability of these mathematical concepts as follows.

1 Point and continuity of ﬂuid

A ﬂuid is composed of numerous moleculae, but could be thought of as continuous provided

that the scales of any physical process in the ﬂuid are much greater than the free path of molecule.

Then the ﬂow of the ﬂuid usually is called as a ﬂow ﬁeld, i.e., the ﬂuid in motion is modeled

as a ﬂow ﬁeld. The ﬂow ﬁeld is continuously composed of the real number points, and is called

as real number space mathematically. Yet after contemplation it is obvious that there does not

exist the “point” of real number space in a real ﬂuid. Therefore, the physical meaning of the

point of the real number space( i.e., ﬂow ﬁeld), or in other words, the physical reality from which

the concept of point is drawn, should be indicated. In fact, the logic of the process,that the real

number space( i.e., ﬂow ﬁeld) is drawn from the ﬂow ﬂuid composed of moleculae, should be as

follows.

It is well known that the motion of the moleculae contained in a very small volume will reach,

by collision with each other, the equilibrium in a very small time interval. By virtue of this fact,

the concept of the ﬂuid-particle has been presented. The ﬂuid, in fact, should be thought to

be physically composed of the ﬂuid-particles. The ﬂuid-particle is a very small volume of ﬂuid

and is real physical object. Hence, the concept of the mathematical point is drawn from the

ﬂuid-particle, i.e., the abstraction of the ﬂuid-particle is the point. After the abstraction from

2

the ﬂuid-particles, the ﬂow ﬁeld composed of the points is obtained. So the point forming ﬂow

ﬁeld is an abstracted concept and is drawn from the ﬂuid-particle, that is to say, the concept of

point is based on the ﬂuid-particle.

Obviously, it is necessary to make this abstraction for knowing the properties of ﬂow. The

mathematical derivation could hardly be put on the base of the ﬂuid-particle. Otherwise, on the

base of real number space composed of the real number points the mathematical derivation, by

which the law and properties of ﬂuid ﬂow can be obtained, is made reasonably.

The ﬂuid-particle is a very small volume of ﬂuid. However small the scale of the ﬂuid-particle

is , it is still ﬁnite from the angle of physical practice. We would like to point out some features

about the scale of the ﬂuid-particle.

The physical world is possessed of the hierarchical structure. The scales of the ﬂuid-particles

in diﬀerent levels are diﬀerent. Surely, the scale of the ﬂuid-particle in higher level should be

much greater than that in lower level. The scale of the ﬂuid-particle in the lowest level in a

physical problem should not be less than a certain scale ξ. The certain scale ξ is the lowest

scale in the scales, any one of which can form the volume which contains enough number of

moleculae for stable statistical average value of physical quantities. The ﬂuid volume, the linear

scale of which is less than the scale ξ, does not have certain average value of physical quantities.

Therefore, that ﬂuid volume could not be called as a ﬂuid-particle.

But the scale of a ﬂuid-particle in any level could not be too large to show the variation of

physical quantities with time and space.

It is important to indicate that the scales of the ﬂuid-particles in any level are all objective.

The scale of the ﬂuid-particle is not determined by people at will, but by the nature of the

speciﬁc physical problem under study. In other words, the scale of the ﬂuid-particle should be

put on the base of physics and be corresponding to the nature of the speciﬁc physical problem

under discussion. As an example, the scale of the ﬂuid-particle in atmospheric ﬂow is much

greater than that in the ﬂow around the wing of an aircraft.

In practical activities, people usually can not give how large, in the concrete, the ﬂuid-particle

is, yet we believe that the scale of the ﬂuid-particle is not set by people’s will, but is objective.

By the concept of the ﬂuid-particle, the clearer physical meaning of the continuity of a ﬂuid

3

can be given, that is: If there is a space scale of ξ, enough number of moleculae are contained

in the ﬂuid volume with linear scale ξ, so that the statistical averaging over the motion of these

moleculae can give the stable value, i.e., the ﬂuid-volume with linear scale ξ just is a ﬂuid-

particle in certain level. And, the space scales of any physical process in the ﬂuid are all greater

than the scale ξ. Further, the motion of the moleculae contained in the volume with linear

scale ξ, by collision with each other, has already reached thermodynamic equilibriums in the

time interval less than or equal to the least time scale in the various time scales of the various

physical processes in the ﬂuid. Then the ﬂuid can be thought of as continuous. In this case, the

eﬀect of ﬂuid composed of moleculae can be ignored, and the real ﬂow of ﬂuid will be modeled

after the ﬂow ﬁeld.

2 Uniform and non-uniform points

The fundamental physical idea in the NATT is that the ﬂuid-particle is wholly uniform in a

laminar ﬂow, but not uniform, i.e.,there is internal structure in the ﬂuid-particle in the case of

turbulence. By that mentioned above, though the ﬂuid-particle in the turbulence can be divided

at will into smaller and uniform ﬂuid-particles in mathematical abstract, we could not reject this

idea, because the ﬂuid-particle can not be divided at will in physical practice. The scale of the

ﬂuid-particle has the objective physical base in practice.

What is the mathematical meaning of this fundamental physical idea in the NATT?

As is stated above, a point(the absolute geometric point) should be mathematically drawn

from only the uniform ﬂuid-particle.

If the non-uniform ﬂuid-particle was, in mathematical

abstraction, thought of as an absolute geometric point too, the internal structure of the non-

uniform ﬂuid-particle can not be described. So this will go against the physical reality. Thus,

the non-uniform ﬂuid-particle should be, in mathematical abstraction, taken as the monad. The

linear scale of the monad is inﬁnitesimal ε,ε 6= 0,but ε > 0. The internal structure can be

permitted in the monad. From the nonstandard analysis, the inﬁnitesimal ε is also number, i.e.,

the nonstandard number. The real number is called as the standard number.

Even in the case of a laminar ﬂow, in fact, the monad is also the mathematical abstraction

4

of the uniform ﬂuid-particle, but is uniform, no internal structure in the monad. The monad no

having internal structure essentially is identiﬁed with the absolute point. This concept can be

shown clearly by the ﬁgure 1-2.

The wholly flow field is just a mathematically hyperreal number
space composed of the monads(i.e., standard points).

Figure 2: Mathematical-abstraction of the ﬂuid-particle in turbulence

Therefore, the physical meaning of mathematical monad is the ﬂuid-particle, i.e., the monad

is the mathematical abstraction of the ﬂuid-particle. In the case of a laminar ﬂow the ﬂuid-

particle is wholly uniform, so the monad(mathematical abstraction of the ﬂuid-particle) is also

uniform. And yet, in turbulence, the ﬂuid-particle is not wholly uniform, so the abstract monad

is non-uniform. In paper [1], the monad is also called as the standard point being diﬀerent from

the absolute point. Thus, correspondingly there are also uniform and non-uniform standard

5

points(usually called as uniform and non-uniform points for short).

In a laminar ﬂow, the

uniform standard point drawn from the uniform ﬂuid-particle is identiﬁed essentially with the

absolute point. So the physical meaning of the absolute point is also the uniform ﬂuid-particle.

The structure of the point in NATT represents just the internal structure of the standard

point, rather than the absolute point, which has no the internal structure. Obviously, the internal

structure of the standard point is the mathematical abstraction just from the internal structure

of the ﬂuid-particle. So the physical meaning of the point-structure is just the internal structure

of the ﬂuid-particle.

Finally, it should be pointed out that the ﬂuid-particle is the physical reality and has ﬁnite

scale. Because the scale of the ﬂuid-particle is very small, it is,in the mathematical abstraction,

thought of as monad, the scale of which is inﬁnitesimal, even thought of as the absolute point,

the scale of which is zero.

In paper [1], it was shown that the ﬂuid-particle, whether or not is uniform, is composed of

numerous ﬂuid-particles in lower level(Fig.3), and a ﬂuid-particle in lower level is uniform and

contains still enough number of ﬂuid moleculae for the stable statistic-average.

Figure 3: Fluid-particle composed of ﬂuid-particles in lower level

The mathematical abstract of the ﬂuid-particle in lower level is the nonstandard point(i.e.,

the internal point of a monad). Therefore, the nonstandard point(i.e., the internal point of a

monad) is uniform point.

So a turbulent ﬁeld is possessed of hierarchical structure: the global turbulent ﬁeld, composed

6

of the monads, i.e., the abstraction from the ﬂuid-particles, is in a level. And the monad ﬁeld(i.e.,

the abstraction from the ﬂow in the ﬂuid-particle), composed of the nonstandard points(the

mathematical abstraction from the ﬂuid-particles in lower level), is in another lower level.

3 Two kinds of diﬀerentiations

Having a function f (x), the derivative of which is

∂f
∂x

= lim
△x→0

f (x + △x) − f (x)
△x

(1)

Here the mathematical meaning of △x → 0 is that △x tends to the absolute zero. But, in

many cases, people can not give the clearly physical meaning of the absolute zero, for example,

the physical meaning of “a ﬂuid volume tends to the absolute zero”. In many cases, in fact,

there is not “absolute zero” in physics. The physical meaning of the statement of “a ﬂuid

volume tends to the absolute zero” is ambiguous. Therefore, the statement of that △x tends to

absolute zero(i.e., △x → 0) in mathematics does not correspond to the fact that any physical

quantity tends to absolute zero, but corresponds to, for example in the case of ﬂuid ﬂow, the

fact that physical quantity △x tends to the scale of the uniform ﬂuid-particle. In other words,

the mathematical abstraction of the fact that △x tends to the scale of the uniform ﬂuid-particle

in physics is that △x → 0. The physical meaning of △x → 0 is that △x tends to the scale of

the uniform ﬂuid-particle.

In NATT, there is other derivative:

∂f
∂x

=

f (x + ε) − f (x)
ε

(2)

Here ε is nonstandard number inﬁnitesimal. The ε is not arbitrary inﬁnitesimal, but the linear

scale of a monad. The monad is the abstraction from the ﬂuid-particle. So the inﬁnitesimal ε, the

linear scale of the monad, is logically the abstraction from the linear scale of the ﬂuid-particle,

namely, the physical meaning of the inﬁnitesimal ε is the linear scale of the ﬂuid-particle.

The deﬁnition (2) has already been presented in the nonstandard analysis. But there the

inﬁnitesimal is arbitrary, here in NATT the ε is certain inﬁnitesimal, the linear scale of a monad.

7

The deﬁnition (1), in general, denotes mathematically that the ∂f

∂x is the rate of increment

of function f at some point(absolute geometric point), i.e., the slope of tangent to the curve

of function f . But, in many cases, the absolute point does not exist in physics, let alone the

rate of increment of function at this point. In the case of ﬂuid, it can be understood that the

physical meaning, which the deﬁnition (1) corresponds to, is the increment(i.e., the increment of

the physical quantity f between two neighbour uniform ﬂuid-particles in some level) divided by

the scale of the ﬂuid-particle in the same level. Let A,B be two neighbour uniform ﬂuid-particles,

the scale of the ﬂuid-particle be L, then the physical meaning of ∂f

∂x in deﬁnition (1) is that

f (B) − f (A)
L

Therefore, from the angle of physics, the deﬁnition (1) is applicable to only the uniform

ﬂuid-particle in some level. Correspondingly, in mathematics, the deﬁnition (1) is applicable to

only the uniform point in the same level.

The right side of the deﬁnition (2), from the angle of mathematics, denotes the increment(i.e.,

the increment of function f between two corresponding internal points of two inﬁnite close

monads) divided by the linear scale of the monad. And the physical meaning of the right side

of deﬁnition (2) is the increment(i.e., the increment of physical quantity function f between two

corresponding ﬂuid-particles in lower level, which are uniform in NATT, of two neighbour ﬂuid-

particles) divided by the scale of the ﬂuid-particle. Let L be the linear scale of the ﬂuid-particle,

b,a be the two corresponding ﬂuid-particles in lower level of two neighbour ﬂuid-particles B,A,

i.e.,b,a are located at the same place in respective ﬂuid-particles(Fig.4).

So the meaning of the deﬁnition (2) is that ∂f

∂x in (2) is the abstraction from the physical

quantity f (b)−f (a)

L

. The reasonability of the mathematical abstract ∂f

∂x in (2) is based on the

real physical quantity f (b)−f (a)

L

. The deﬁnition (2) can be applicable to both the uniform and

nonuniform ﬂuid-particle in physics, or to both the uniform and nonuniform point in mathemat-

ics.

If, in ﬂuid mechanics, the conservation laws of physics(the conservation of mass, momentum

and energy) are applied to uniform and nonuniform ﬂuid-particle in some level respectively,

Here the sign “∼” denotes the average over all the nonstandard points contained in a monad.

The equations (5)(6) hold for both the uniform and nonuniform point. The equations (5)(6)

will degenerate into the Navier-Stokes equations (3)(4) in the case of the uniform point.

The diﬀerentiation (1) is based on the limit, expressed as the statement of δ − ε, and in the

frame of δ − ε. The diﬀerentiation (2) is not based on the limit, and out of the frame of δ − ε.

The statement of δ − ε shows mathematically the endless process of inﬁnite tending, and

makes the expression of the process stricter mathematically. But it, in the stating the process

of inﬁnite tending, for example inﬁnite tending to zero, does not give any room to physics, i.e.,

it shows the process of tending to the absolute zero or to the absolute nil. However, the real

physics should be: the process of inﬁnite tending to zero is just a mathematical abstraction from

the real process of gradually tending to the scale of the uniform ﬂuid-particle in some level.

The statement of δ − ε obliterates this real uniform ﬂuid-particle. In many cases, this oblit-

eration does not have an eﬀect on the results. Yet the obliteration will make some problems

sometimes. How if the ﬂuid-particle is not uniform? The structure in the ﬂuid-particle can not

be shown by the absolute point. Turbulence just is the case. Here the statement of δ − ε should

be abandoned and the diﬀerentiation (2) is adopted. The diﬀerentiation (2) is mathematically

based on the inﬁnitesimal. In the sixties of the last century, the nonstandard analysis was pre-

sented. It is proved strictly in the nonstandard analysis that there exists the inﬁnitesimal. This

gives the mathematical foundation to the new description of turbulence.

continuity

In section 1, we showed the physical meaning of the ﬂuid continuity. From the physical reality

the mathematical model of ﬂuid, i.e., continuous ﬂow ﬁeld, is obtained. In the continuous ﬂow

ﬁeld, the physical properties(i.e., the various physical quantities on all points of the ﬁeld) vary

continuously with time and space. Yet the mathematical description of the continuously varying

of the physical quantities is diﬀerent in two cases, the standard and nonstandard analysis.

In the case of standard analysis, when the function representing the physical quantity is

continuous mathematically, the physical quantity is thought of as continuous. In other words,

the physical quantity varies continuously with time and space, the function f representing the

physical quantity is, in mathematics, continuous function. The deﬁnition of continuous function

is that(Fig.5)

lim
△x→0

[f (x + △x) − f (x)] = 0

Note that the function f (x) is characterized by only the function value.

But, in nonstandard analysis, this is not the case. Here the function representing the physical

10

(real space)

Figure 5: Continuous function f (x)

quantity should be written as f (x, x′), the sign x denotes the x-monad in some hyper real number

space, x′ is the internal coordinates in the monad, i.e., x′ is the coordinates of the internal point

of the x-monad(Fig.6). The f (x, x′) expresses the value of the physical quantity at the internal

point x′ of the x-monad. Then the continuously varying, with time and space, of the physical

quantity expressed by the function f (x, x′) means that not only the value but also the structure

of the function f (x, x′) vary continuously. In other words, what is continuous function of f (x, x′)

means that not only the increment of f (x + △x, x′) − f (x, x′) tends to inﬁnitesimal, but also

the shape of the function f (x + △x, x′) tends inﬁnitely to the shape of the function f (x, x′),

when △x tends to inﬁnitesimal ε(the linear scale of a monad), i.e., the two monads(the monad

(x + △x) and the monad (x) ) are inﬁnitely close to each other(Fig.7).

the function shape should be continuous, if the physical quantity function is continuous. This

means that the continuity of the ﬂuid should be the continuity of the function shape as well as

the function value. There are two sides in the continuity of ﬂuid in the case of the nonstandard

analysis.

In the standard analysis, the physical meaning of the mathematically continuity of the func-

tion expresses the relationship between only two neighbour uniform ﬂuid-particles. When people

say that the function representing the physical quantity is continuous, the physical meaning of

the continuity is that the diﬀerence of the value of the physical quantity between two neighbour

uniform ﬂuid-particles is very small.

Similarly, in the nonstandard analysis, the mathematical concept of continuity depicts, in

physics, just the relationship between two neighbour ﬂuid-particles(both uniform and nonuni-

form). The diﬀerence of the physical quantity, its value and structure(i.e., the structure of

the physical quantity function), between the two neighbour ﬂuid-particles is very small. In the

NATT, this is called as assumption of close property between two neighbour ﬂuid-particles, in ab-

straction, between two inﬁnitely close monads. The assumption is just the continuity(physically

corresponding to the case of both uniform and nonuniform ﬂuid-particle) in the nonstandard

analysis, the expansion of the continuity(physically corresponding to the case of only uniform

12

ﬂuid-particle) in normally the standard analysis. The reasonability of this assumption should

be checked up by the reasonability of the results from the assumption.

There is discontinuity in opposition to the continuity. In order to show these concepts clearly,

the concept of the ﬂuctuation in a ﬂuid will be discussed on further as follows.

If the precision of the measurement in turbulence is very high, are the data obtained from

the measurement continuous(no ﬂuctuation)?

As is stated above, the concept of the monad is drawn from the ﬂuid-particle. Here, the

monad and ﬂuid-particle is in the space of four dimensions, time and space. What is the ﬂuid-

particle in space(three dimensions) is clear. Yet the meaning of the ﬂuid-particle in time-direction

needs to be indicated. Let the time scale of the ﬂuid-particle be δt, the time scale of the ﬂuid-

particle in lower level be τ . Surely, the scale of δt and τ are all objective, and determined by

the physical nature of the problem under discussion. The scale τ needs to meet the require-

ments of the conditions as follows: The motion of the ﬂuid moleculae contained in the space

ﬂuid-particle in lower level, by collision with each other, has already reached thermodynamic

equilibrium in the time period of τ . The time-direction scale, which is inﬁnitesimal, of the

monad in four dimensions and the time-direction scale, which is high order inﬁnitesimal, of the

monad-interior point(nonstandard point) in four dimensions are the mathematical abstraction

of δt and τ respectively.

It is known that if the measurement in a ﬂuid is carried out in the level of atom and molecule,

i.e., the measurement of the motion of atom and molecule, the results of the measurement will

show the random motion, controlled by the quantum law, of the atom and molecule. This

measurement is out of the studying at present. Now the objective of the measurement is the

mean quantity of the motion of numerous moleculae.

Assume that the motion of numerous moleculae contained in the space ﬂuid-particle in lower

level, by collision with each other, has already reached the thermodynamic equilibrium in only

the time interval greater than or equal to τ . The sampling time in the measurement is t0. If

t0 < τ , the data of the measurement can not indicate the physical properties of this ﬂuid particle

in lower level, but the average value, which is instable, of the motion properties of the moleculae

contained in the ﬂuid volume being less than the ﬂuid-particle in lower level. So the data are

13

ﬂuctuant. If t0 > τ , but ≪ δt(the time scale of the ﬂuid-particle), the data of measurement

should be continuous(not ﬂuctuation) and obey the Navier-Stokes equations. The measurement,

in fact, is carried out in the range of time scale of a ﬂuid-particle. But the usual measurement

in turbulence are not the cases.

In the turbulence measurement at present, the time-samples are taken from the numerous

time scales of the numerous ﬂuid-particles in lower level, which are contained in the various ﬂuid-

particles of four dimensions. The results for one sample are just the statistic average values of

the motion properties, which are reached equilibrium by molecule-collision with each other in the

interval τ , of the numerous moleculae contained in the space ﬂuid-particle in lower level. In other

words, in the mathematical abstract, the samples are taken from the numerous time-scales of the

numerous internal points of various monads(Fig.8). The essential character of this measurement

is that the measurer can not know which internal point of a monad is measured, but know only

which monad contains the measured internal point. So the measurer know only the range over a

monad, but can not know the strict position of the measured objective. This is the uncertainty

of turbulence measurement. Therefore, obtained data will show the ﬂuctuation provided that

the motion properties of diﬀerent internal points of a monad are obviously diﬀerent.

Figure 8: The scheme of the sampling in turbulence measurement

Though it is possible in theory that the measurements are carried out continuously on the

diﬀerent internal points of one monad, this precision can be reached by modern technology, the

14

continuous data can be obtained in the monad. And the consecutive measurement is in the next

monad. And so on and so forth, there are continuous measurements in various monads one by

one. However, the concrete operation of the measurement is borne hardly at all, because it is

nearly the process in which inﬁnite samples are taken. This process of the measurement as well

as the process of solving inﬁnite equations is not possible. Therefore, this measurement exists

only in theory and imagining, but not in reality.

Thus the practical measurement of turbulence will give, as mentioned above, the ﬂuctuant

results. This ﬂuctuation results from the measurement of the regular ﬂow(the turbulence is also

regular). Note that the ﬂuid ﬂow itself is one thing, the result from the measurement of the ﬂuid

ﬂow is another. They have relation closely with each other, but are not the same thing. The

irregular measurement results does not denote the irregularity and un-continuity of the ﬂuid ﬂow

itself, conversely, the continuity and regularity of the ﬂuid ﬂow does not exclude the possibility of

the irregular results(or called as the ﬂuctuation) from the measurement of the ﬂuid ﬂow. When

the turbulence measurement is carried out, what is met with is the fact that the irregular and

ﬂuctuant data are obtained from the measurement of regular and continuous ﬂuid ﬂow. It is

maybe said that the turbulence-ﬂuctuation, in fact, just is the ﬂuctuation of the data from the

turbulence measurement.

About the ﬂuctuation, in a word, except the random results of measurement in molecule level,

there are the ﬂuctuation results from not reaching the stable state of statistic average, i.e., from

the measurement in the range of the scale less than that of the ﬂuid-particle in the least level,

and the ﬂuctuation results especially from the uncertainty of turbulence measurement(in the

level of global ﬁeld). Only the turbulence-measurement in a monad, the mathematical concept

drawn from the ﬂuid-particle, possibly gives the continuous results.

In NATT, there is a mathematical concept of the monad-average(point-average). The phys-

ical meaning of the point-average is the average over the motion of numerous lower level ﬂuid-

particles in a ﬂuid-particle. The point-average is drawn from the average over the ﬂuid-particle.

Here the point-average is diﬀerent from the normal average in turbulence researching, and it

is not over measurement data. Surely, we easy connect the point-average in NATT with the

normal average in turbulence researching. The value of the point-average can be obtained by

15

the theoretical computation(after discretization of the controlling equations the point-average

is, in fact, the grid-average), then the average value, being comparable with the average-value

from the measurement, is easy obtained from the grid-average.

The standard and nonstandard analysis are mentioned in NATT. In a laminar ﬂow, the stan-

dard analysis is employed; in turbulence, the nonstandard analysis is employed. Either laminar

or turbulent ﬂow, in fact, either the standard or nonstandard analysis all can be employed. The

standard analysis means that there is description of one level, the nonstandard analysis means

that there is description of multi-levels. In the standard analysis, the description of a ﬂuid ﬂow

is based on the uniform ﬂuid-particle(i.e., the ﬂuid-particle in a laminar ﬂow, the ﬂuid-particle

in lower level in a turbulent ﬂow). The ﬂuid-particle as well as the ﬂuid-particle in lower level

is wholly uniform in the case of a laminar ﬂow, so the ﬂuid-particle can be thought of as ba-

sic element in a laminar ﬂow. And just the ﬂuid-particle corresponds to the physical practice.

Therefore, the standard analysis, the description of one level, is employed in a laminar ﬂow. How-

ever, in turbulence, the ﬂuid-particle is not wholly uniform and the ﬂuid-particles in lower level

contained in the ﬂuid-particle are possessed of respective diﬀerent motion properties. Obviously,

there are multi-levels in turbulence. This is why the nonstandard analysis is employed in turbu-

lence. The standard analysis, in theory, can also be employed, i.e., the description of one level

and still the Navier-Stokes equations controlling the ﬂow, in turbulence, but the ﬂuid-particle in

lower level must be the basic element. Yet the ﬂuid-particle in lower level does not correspond

to the physical practice. There does exist some unsuitability in practice. The evident example

of this unsuitability is that the diﬃculty of the very enormous amount of calculation work will

be met, as the Navier-Stokes equations are solved by numerical calculation in turbulence.

5 Discretization of the equations

Here the ε is the linear scale of a monad and is inﬁnitesimal(nonstandard number). The Ui,P

are the instantaneous velocity and pressure. The ui,p are the ﬂuctuant velocity and pressure.

They are the functions of (x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′). The

fUi,

eP are the point-averages(monad-

averages) of the instantaneous velocity and pressure. The independent variables of the

eP
fUi,

are only (x1, x2, x3, t). Note that here the ﬂuctuant quantities are diﬀerent from the normal

ﬂuctuations in a turbulent measurement. The deﬁnition of the ﬂuctuations ui,p is that ui =

Ui − fUi and p = P − eP . Obviously, the ui,p are deﬁned in a monad. Therefore, the ui,p would

be called as the ﬂuctuations in a monad, or the internal ﬂuctuations.

The diﬀerentiation (2) has been applied to ∂

∂t , ∂

∂x in these equations. So the equations can

be applied to both the uniform and nonuniform monads. What is the physical meaning of the

discretization of the equations (7)-(11)? By virtue of the fact that the inﬁnitesimal ε in the

deﬁnition (2) is the linear scale of a monad, the discretization of the equations (7)-(11) means

the coarsening of the monad. But the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations means, in the

case of turbulence, the coarsening of the uniform internal point, essentially identiﬁed with the

absolute point, of a monad. There are diﬀerent meanings between two. The monad is abstract

from the ﬂuid-particle, but the scale of grid of discretization of (7)-(11) is, in general, not equal

to the scale of ﬂuid-particle in practice. If the physical relation between the neighbour grids

is very close to the real physical relation between the neighbour ﬂuid-particles, the results of

computation will be approximately correct, and the discretization is reasonable. Conversely, if

17

the physical relation between the neighbour grids is not close to that between the neighbour

ﬂuid-particles, the correct results can not be obtained and the discretization is not reasonable.

We know by that mentioned above that the Navier-Stokes equations are based on the

limit(△x → 0,△t → 0), and the Navier-Stokes equations can be applied to only the uniform

point(i.e., the abstract from the uniform ﬂuid-particle). Yet the equations of (7)-(11) can be per-

mitted to apply to the nonuniform point(i.e., the abstract from the nonuniform ﬂuid-particle).

In turbulence, the ﬂuid-particle, the abstraction of which is the monad, is not uniform, but the

ﬂuid-particle in lower level, the abstraction of which is the nonstandard point(i.e., the internal

point of the monad), is uniform. Therefore, in turbulence, the Navier-Stokes equations can be

applied to only the internal points of a monad rather than to the monad itself. But the equations

(7)-(11) can be applied to the monad itself. When the computation of these equations is carried

out, the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations means the coarsening of the internal point

of a monad, physically corresponding to the ﬂuid-particle in lower level, and the discretization

of equations (7)-(11) means the coarsening of the monad itself, physically corresponding to the

ﬂuid-particle. Therefore, in the turbulent computation, the grid of discretization corresponds to

the ﬂuid-particle in lower level in the case of computation of the Navier-Stokes equations, but

corresponds to the ﬂuid-particle itself in the case of computation of the equations (7)-(11). In

other words, only the very ﬁne grids, which introduces the very enormous amount of calculation

work, can meet the needs for obtaining the reasonable solution of the Navier-Stokes equations,

but the coarse grids can meet the needs for the reasonable solution of the equations (7)-(11) in

the case of the turbulence computation. It does not need to be ﬁne grids, so there is not the

diﬃculty of enormous amount of calculation work in the turbulent computation of the equations

(7)-(11).

First, the mathematical concepts are drawn from the physical reality. And by virtue of the

mathematical concepts a series of the mathematical derivations and calculations are performed

in order to obtain the various results about the physical properties, for example, the controlling

equations. Then, after the discretization of the controlling equations the computation of the

discretization-equations is carried out and the various physical properties of the concrete problem

are obtained. There are two procedures, from the physical reality to the mathematical abstract

18

and from the mathematical abstract to the physical reality, the latter is a converse procedure of

the former.

6 Conclusions

In the sections above, the discussion on some important mathematical concepts and the

corresponding physical meanings to these concepts is given. What are called as the corresponding

physical meanings are the physical objects from which the mathematical concepts are drawn.

The results are, in sum, as follows.

Finally, what is stated in this paper is that the reasonability of the mathematical concepts,

especially in physics, is based just on their corresponding physical reality. Every reasonable

mathematical concept, even mathematical derivation method, must be possessed of its physical

foundation, i.e., is the abstract from the physical object(physical reality). In physics, there does

not exist the mathematical concept broken away from the physical reality. People, sometimes,

ignore carelessly this fact, and are limited to and only stay on the stage of the pure mathematics.

Because getting accustomed, for example, to the absolute point in mathematical abstraction,

some researchers usually do not pay attention to the eﬀect of the fact that there does not exist the

absolute point in physical reality on the description of physical problem such as the turbulence.

And the physical problem becomes very diﬃcult to comprehend due to this carelessness. But

after the contemplation over the physical meanings of these mathematical concepts, in other

words, over what are the real physical objects from which these mathematical concepts are

drawn, the diﬃcult problem may be suddenly enlightened.

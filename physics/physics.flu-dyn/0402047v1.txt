(Received ?? and in revised form ??)

Grease ice is an agglomeration of disc-shaped ice crystals, named frazil ice, which forms
in turbulent waters of the Polar Oceans and in rivers as well. It has been recognized
that the properties of grease ice to damp surface gravity waves could be explained in
terms of the eﬀective viscosity of the ice slurry. This paper is devoted to the study of
the dynamics of a suspension of disc-shaped particles in a gravity wave ﬁeld. For dilute
suspensions, depending on the strength and frequency of the external wave ﬂow, two
orientation regimes of the particles are predicted: a preferential orientation regime with
the particles rotating in coherent fashion with the wave ﬁeld, and a random orientation
regime in which the particles oscillate around their initial orientation while diﬀusing
under the eﬀect of Brownian motion. For both motion regimes, the eﬀective viscosity has
been derived as a function of the wave frequency, wave amplitude and aspect ratio of the
particles. Model predictions have been validated against wave attenuation data in frazil
ice layers grown in wave tanks.

1. Introduction

Grease ice is a thin slurry of disc-like platelets of ice crystals, called frazil ice, which
forms in supercooled waters of the Polar Oceans under cold and windy conditions. Frazil
discs measure approximately 0.1
100µm in thickness (Kivisild
1970). Grease ice can accumulate up to tens of centimeters and signiﬁcantly aﬀect ocean
surface roughness by attenuating short waves. This eﬀect has been widely documented by
early whalers’ observations. Furthermore, synthetic aperture radar imagery of grease ice
scenes appears dark because of the suppression of the gravity-capillary waves resonant
with the incident microwave radiation (1

10cm) (Wadhams & Holt 1991).

Laboratory measurements of wave propagation in grease ice show that wave attenu-
ation can be explained in terms of the medium eﬀective viscosity (Newyear & Martin
1997). Martin & Kauﬀman (1981) developed a viscous-plastic model to explain the ob-
served wave attenuation. They claimed that the viscous nature of grease ice could arise
from interactions among frazil crystals leading to the presence of an energy sink in the
wave dynamics. The authors did not present any estimate of grease ice eﬀective viscosity
from their data. On the other hand, wave dispersion and attenuation data of Newyear
& Martin (1997) were consistent with a constant viscosity value, comparable to that of
glycerin at 0◦C, in the range of frequencies from 6.6 to 9.5s−1 (Newyear & Martin 1999).

The viscosity was estimated using a two-layer wave propagation model, which represents
grease ice as a viscous ﬂuid superimposed on inviscid water (Keller 1998).

As a matter of fact, the concept of bulk viscosity for grease ice holds because the size
0.1cm) is much smaller than both the vertical scale of grease
1m) of the travelling wave (Newyear & Martin

∼
10cm) and the horizontal scale (

of the frazil particles (
ice (
∼
1999).

From the theoretical point of view, it is possible to have detailed information on the
behavior of a suspension of disk-like particles in the velocity ﬁeld of a gravity wave only in
the dilute limit. In this limit, the problem becomes that of the behavior of an individual
particle in a given ﬂow ﬁeld, in the absence of interactions with the other particles in
suspension. Iterative approaches such as that of the diﬀerential scheme (Bruggeman 1935)
can then be used to obtain semi-quantitative informations in the high volume fraction
regimes characteristic of grease ice.

A second simpliﬁcation is obtained disregarding inertia eﬀects at the scale of the ice
platelets. Starting from the work of Jeﬀery (1922), much work has been devoted to
the dynamics of an ellipsoidal particle under creeping ﬂow conditions. The importance of
Brownian motion for the presence of an equilibrium particle orientation distribution, and
consequently for the existence of a uniquely deﬁned bulk viscosity, was already recognized
in (Taylor 1923). It turns out that, unless the particles are so small that Brownian
diﬀusion dominates, the orientation distribution strongly resents the interaction with the
external ﬂow and this eﬀect cannot be disregarded for relatively large particles like the ice
platelets. As recognized in (Bretherton 1962), this may lead, in ﬂow regions characterized
by high strain and low vorticity, to the possibility of ﬁxed orientation regimes for the
particles.

The calculation of the bulk viscosity of a suspension of ellipsoids in a time independent
plane shear was carried on in (Leal & Hinch 1972), in the small but non-zero Brownian
motion regime. Only more recently was the orientation dynamics of an ellipsoidal particle
in a time-dependent ﬂow taken into consideration (Szeri et al. 1992).

In the present paper, we shall consider only the case of gravity waves in inﬁnitely deep
water. In this case, it is possible to pass to a reference frame in which the ﬂow is time
independent, and this eliminates the possibility of irregular orbits in orientation space,
observed in (Szeri et al. 1992) already in the case of simple periodic ﬂows.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the orientation dynamics of a
particle in a deep water gravity wave will be elucidated. In particular, the possibility of
coherent collective motions in the suspension will be examined. In Section III, the eﬀective
viscosity of a dilute ellipsoid suspension will be calculated, analyzing its dependence on
the wave frequency and amplitude. In Section IV, using a diﬀerential scheme, the results
will be extrapolated away from the dilute limit, and will be compared with available data
from wave-tank experiments. Section V will be devoted to conclusions.

2. Orientation of a disk-like particle in the velocity ﬁeld of a deep

water gravity wave

We consider a dilute suspension of rigid oblate axisymmetric ellipsoids, supposed small
enough that inertia be negligible at the particle scale. We also suppose that the particles
are free of external forces or torques and that the suspension is so dilute that the eﬀects
of mutual interaction among particles are negligible. In this dilute limit, the rheological
properties of the suspension will descend from the response of a single particle to the
time dependent wave ﬂow.

In order to represent the wave ﬂow, we introduce a reference frame with the origin

at the water surface, the x1-axis along the direction of propagation of the wave and the
x2-axis pointing vertically towards the sea-bottom. In the hypothesis of small amplitude
inviscid waves in inﬁnitely deep water, we obtain the following velocity ﬁeld:

where ˜U is a typical value for the ﬂuid velocity in the wave ﬁeld. A particle in the
velocity ﬁeld (2.1) will move with the same velocity as the ﬂuid around, provided its
inertia is suﬃciently small. For a Stokesian particle of linear size a and mass m in a ﬂuid
of kinematic viscosity ν, we can estimate the relaxation time of the particle velocity V
on that of the ﬂuid by means of the Stokes time of a spherical particle of similar size

The orientation dynamics in the presence of fore-aft symmetry, will in turn be determined
by the balance between the strain E and the vorticity Ω of the wave at the particle
position, provided the particle is suﬃciently small to allow linearization of the wave ﬁeld
on its scale. In the case of a revolution ellipsoid, with symmetry axis identiﬁed by the
versor p, the orientation dynamics will be described by the Jeﬀery equation:

We thus have a high strain regime in which, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the particles in
suspension are all aligned with the local strain and rotate in coherent fashion, and a low
strain regime in which the particles do not rotate, rather, they oscillate around their
natural orientation. As it is easy to see from Eq. (2.9), the transition from the low to
the high strain regime is characterized by the particle spending an increasing amount of

independently of its amplitude, guarantees that memory of any initial particle orientation,

This result diﬀers at subleading order O(1) from the one in (Leal & Hinch 1972). As
seen in the previous section, two orientation dynamics regimes are possible and these
aﬀect the value of the angular averages entering Eq. (3.1). We consider in detail the two
regimes below.

From the stress σ, it is possible to calculate an eﬀective viscosity µ∗ in terms of the

viscous dissipation in the suspension, exactly as it is done with spherical particles:

fashion with the wave ﬁeld. The fourth and second order tensors

3.2. Continuously rotating regime: ˆω > 1
In the laboratory frame this regime corresponds to the particle oscillating around its ini-
tial orientation, while slowly diﬀusing with respect to angle, under the eﬀect of Brownian
couples. In the rotating frame, the problem can be mapped to that of the ellipsoid in a

Eﬀective viscosity of grease ice

identical to that of a particle with aspect ratio

orientation dynamics is described by Eq. (2.7), in the presence of an isotropic Brownian
couple, is then obtained from the theory of (Leal & Hinch 1972), whose main results are
reported below.

The particle orientation is identiﬁed by the variables ˆt and c where ˆt is deﬁned by the
ﬁrst of Eq. (2.9) and gives the normalized time needed, on the Jeﬀery orbit starting from
the current values of θ and ψ, to go from ψ = 0 to the current value of ψ, while c obeys:

eﬀective viscosity grows away from the crossover at ˆω = 1, with the dip becoming more
pronounced as the aspect ratio r is sent to zero. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, in the case
of a disk-like particle with a value of the aspect ratio in the range characteristic for frazil

We remark that, using the values of A, B and C given in (Leal & Hinch 1972), would

4. Model validation

We have validated our model in the deep water approximation using the wave tank
data of (Martin & Kauﬀman 1981). In their experiment, concentrated suspensions of
grease ice with thicknesses varying from 7 to 15cm were allowed to grow in a 200cm long
tank previously ﬁlled with saline water to a depth of 41cm. The waves were generated
by means of a paddle, mounted at one end of the tank, with frequencies ranging from
10.7 to 15.7s−1 and wave amplitudes ranging from about 1.3 to 3.3cm. These frequencies
correspond to wavelengths in the range from 25 to 54cm. We selected those measurements
relevant to propagation of deep waves in grease ice layer according to the criterium
kh > π/2, where k is the open water wavenumber and h is the ice layer thickness
(Phillips 1966). Wave amplitudes were reported only for a subset of the totality, namely
for frequencies equal to 14.9 and 10.7s−1. While all the ω = 14.9s−1 data fulﬁlled the deep
wave condition for each generated wave amplitude
, only one run could be considered at
ω = 10.7s−1. The case ω = 14.9s−1 in (Martin & Kauﬀman 1981) shows two regimes of
attenuation rate with the distance and we considered both. Grease ice eﬀective viscosities
were estimated from the measured spatial attenuation rates by using a two-layer viscous
ﬂuid wave propagation model (De Carolis & Desiderio 2002). The wave propagation

ˆω < 1. The horizontal line to the right gives the asymptotic value K(ˆω → ∞).

model describes wave dispersion and attenuation of surface waves travelling in a system
of two layered viscous ﬂuids, each characterized by its own density, depth and viscosity
coeﬃcient. Because of its general formulation, its applicability extends beyond that of
previously developed two-layer viscous models, such as (Weber 1987) and (Keller 1998).
In particular, the two-layer viscous ﬂuid model was successfully exploited to estimate
grease ice eﬀective viscosities resulting from the experimental study of wave attenuation
described in (Newyear & Martin 1997).

The diﬀerential scheme, originally proposed by (Bruggeman 1935), provides an ana-
lytical method to generalize the well-known Einstein formula for the eﬀective viscosity
of dilute suspensions to ﬁnite concentrations (Brinkman 1952), (Roscoe 1952). More re-
cently, the diﬀerential scheme has been exploited to study the viscosity problems related
to randomly oriented spheroidal inclusions in viscous ﬂuids (Phan-Thien & Pham 2000).
Assuming that the suspended particles can pack together so that the maximum con-
centration value φ can be φMAX = 1, the diﬀerential scheme predicts that the eﬀective
viscosity µ∗ for the suspension with concentration φ can be expressed as:

µ∗ = µ(1

φ)−K

−

(4.1)

where K is the reduced viscosity of the dilute suspension. The reduced viscosity K can
thus be determined by inverting Eq. (4.1) in order to estimate the corresponding particles’
aspect ratio by means of Eqs. (3.2,3.4,3.10) and the data in Fig. 2. Figure 4 shows the
analysis results. The estimated reduced viscosity K is plotted vs. the non-dimensional
frequency ˆω = ω

2Aω2 [see Eqs. (2.10-2.11)].

2e = g

To be precise, the diﬀerential scheme assumes implicitly that viscosity renormalization
is the only eﬀect of the particle inclusion, which is strictly true only when the particle
orientation distribution and consequently the viscosity tensor are isotropic. From Fig. 4,
however, we see that the data fall in the range of ˆω where this assumption holds.

As shown in Fig. 4, we obtain the estimate: 1.64

5. Conclusions

We have obtained predictions on the eﬀective viscosity dependence of grease ice on the
aspect ratio and the concentration of the frazil ice particles. A key parameter appears to
be, in the dilute limit, the relative strength of the wave ﬁeld strain, which parametrizes the
wave amplitude, and the wave frequency. For high amplitude waves, collective alignment
of the particles in suspension with the wave ﬁeld is possible, with the crossover to this
regime signalled by a deep minimum in the eﬀective viscosity. This minimum is actually
lower than the eﬀective viscosity in the case of spherical particles and can be smaller,
by orders of magnitude, than the value of the eﬀective viscosity of a disk-like particle
suspension away from the crossover.

An interesting question is whether these behaviors are preserved away from the deep
water wave regime we have considered in this paper. For shallow water waves, a rotating
system in which the ﬂow becomes time-independent does not exist anymore, and irregular
behaviors of the kind described in (Szeri et al. 1992) become possible.

For realistic values of ice concentration, comparison with eﬀective viscosity values from
wave attenuation data in wave tanks (Martin & Kauﬀman 1981) shows agreement be-
tween experiments and our theoretical predictions for frazil ice aspect ratios. Nonetheless,
the observed grease ice structure deserves some consideration, as clusters of small frazil
discs, measuring as much as 0.5cm, are commonly observed in polar ocean environments.
In fact, the presence of clustering could lead to a decrease of the grease ice eﬀective

viscosity, for the same values of frazil ice volume fraction and aspect ratio. In the pres-
ence of clustering, Eq. (4.1), which does not account for particle clusters, should then be
replaced by an appropriate expression, such as e.g. the one proposed by (Starov et al.
2002):

µ∗ = µ(1

φ
φMAX

)−AK

(5.1)

where A 6 1 is an average coeﬃcient, which takes into account the cluster size distribu-
tion and φMAX represents an averaged packing density of all clusters.

Equation (5.1) assumes that the eﬀective viscosity of a concentrated distribution
is completely determined by cluster size distribution, regardless of the nature of the
physical-chemical processes underlying the cluster formation. The parameter A could be
evaluated if a detailed knowledge of the hydrodynamic interactions and applied shear
rates, which arise among interacting frazil discs, were provided. The latter subject is
beyond the purpose of this paper.

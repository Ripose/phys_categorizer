(Dated: January 16, 2007)

A reason has been given for the inverse energy cascade in the two-dimensionalised rapidly rotating
3D incompressible turbulence. For such system, literature shows a possibility of the exponent of
wavenumber in the energy spectrum’s relation to lie between -2 and -3. We argue the existence of
a more strict range of -2 to -7/3 for the exponent in the case of rapidly rotating turbulence which
is in accordance with the recent experiments. Also, a rigorous derivation for the two point third
order structure function has been provided helping one to argue that even with slow rotation one
gets, though dominated, a spectrum with the exponent -2.87, thereby hinting at the initiation of
the two-dimensionalisation eﬀect with rotation.

Rotating turbulence, which is bridging the gap be-
tween 2D, quasi-2D and 3D turbulences, shows an ex-
tremely interesting property of two-dimensionalisation of
3D turbulence. This aspect of research in turbulence is
of current interest to oceanographers, geophysicists, me-
teorologists, mathematicians, physicists and others.

In the steady non-turbulent ﬂow, for low Rossby num-
ber (Ro = U/2LØ) and high Reynolds number (Re =
U L/ν), Taylor-Proudman theorem[1] argues that rota-
tion two-dimensionalises the ﬂow. This argument is of-
ten mistakenly extended to turbulent ﬂows to explain the
rotation induced two-dimensionalisation arising therein.
The two-dimensionalisation of the 3D turbulent ﬂow in
presence of rotation has begun to be understood as a
subtle non-linear eﬀect, which is distinctly diﬀerent from
Taylor-Proudman eﬀect, due to the works of Cambon[2],
Waleﬀe[3] and others who basically showed that all one
means by the two-dimensionalisation is that the strong
angular dependence of this eﬀect leads to a draining
of the spectral energy from the parallel to the normal
wave vectors (w.r.t.
the rotation axis). Simulations
(e.g. by Smith et al.[4]) speak volumes for the two-
dimensionalisation eﬀect besides showing the initiation
of inverse cascade of energy with rapid rotation, a fact
well supported by the experiments[5, 7].

This reverse cascade of energy is an important signa-
ture of the two-dimensionalisation of turbulence due to
rapid rotation and the other signature which we shall
elaborately deal with in this letter is that the exponent
of wavenumber in the energy spectrum’s relation is dif-
ferent from the usual -5/3 for the isotropic homogeneous
3D incompressible turbulence.

Although recent experiments by Baroud et al.[5, 6]
and Morize et al.[7, 8] have shed some light on the two-
dimensionalisation eﬀect, the scaling of two-point statis-
tics and energy spectrum in rotating turbulence remains

lent ﬂuid and this does seem to be validated by some
experiments[5, 6] and numerical simulations[11, 12, 13,
14]. But some experiments[7] do not tally with this pro-
posed spectrum. They predict steeper than k−2 spectrum
and this again seem to be drawing some support from nu-
merical results[15, 16] and analytical results found using
wave turbulence theory[17, 18].

Let us ﬁrst concentrate on why at all there should be
an inverse cascade of energy. Inverse cascade of energy is
a trademark of 2D turbulence where a second conserved
quantity – enstrophy – besides energy plays the deﬁn-
ing role behind it. One might be tempted to search for
this conserved quantity in the case of rapidly rotating
3D turbulence, for, there in the limit of inﬁnite rotation
the axes of all the vortices are expected to point up to-
wards the direction of angular velocity and looking at
the every section perpendicular to the axis one might
tend to take that as if showing 2D turbulence which ob-
viously is not a correct inference because of the non-zero
value of the axial velocity that may depend on the coor-
dinates on the plane. Searching for the enstrophy con-
servation seems to be a dead end as far as explaining
the inverse cascade in rapidly rotating turbulence is con-

long known that helicity is introduced into a rotating
turbulent ﬂow[19]. Kraichnan[20] argued that both the
helicity and energy cascade in 3D turbulence would pro-
ceed from lower to higher wave numbers and went on to
remark that forward helicity cascade would pose a hin-
drance for the energy cascade, a fact validated by numer-
ical simulations[21, 22]. He also showed that in presence
of helicity two-way cascade is possible. Lets see topo-

a knotted vortex tube is capable of introducing helicity
in ﬂuid[23]. Consider a knotted vortex tube (see Fig-1)
in a turbulent ﬂow. Due to the vortex stretching phe-
nomenon in turbulence, the vortex line stretches and as
a result owing to the assumed incompressibility of the
ﬂuid the tube thins out keeping the volume inside it pre-
served and smaller scales are created; in a sense, this is

If one assumes that the wave vector k2 is losing energy
e.g. δE2 < 0, then the results (4) and (5) show that as
more helicity go to the higher wavenumber, the energy
is equally distributed among the lower and the higher
wave numbers suggesting a possibility of reverse cascade
of energy along with a forward energy cascade.

Now let us come to the point.

In the case of 3D
isotropic and homogeneous turbulence rotation can
input helicity in it when there is a mean ﬂow in the
inertial frame and this value of input helicity increases
with the increase in angular velocity. Experiments on
rotating turbulence invariably introduce helicity. As
the angular velocity is increased the helicity increases
enough to inhibit the energy cascade appreciably so that
a reverse cascade is seen. This consistently explains
the reason behind the existence of the reverse energy
cascade in a rapidly rotating turbulent ﬂow.

Lets give a twist to the tale.

In general, the energy
spectrum[19] in the inertial range will be determined by
both the helicity cascade and the energy cascade which
simply means that the energy spectrum from the dimen-

what is meant by the ﬂow of energy to the smaller scales.
But now this also means that the “scale” of the knotted
structure would in general increase i.e., the knot would
now reach out to farther regions in the ﬂuid. Evidently, if
we wanted this scale to reduce, we must let the stretched
knotted tube fold in such a way so that the scale be-
comes smaller; such a neat arrangement seems to be a
far cry in a turbulent ﬂow which is inherently chaotically
random causing the separation of two nearby particles of
ﬂuid on an average. Thus, as the degree of knottedness
measures helicity, the aforementioned argument suggests
that if one forces energy to go to smaller scales, helic-
ity would tend to go to larger scale and vice-versa. This
topological argument gives an intuitive way of compre-
hending how the forward helicity cascade can inhibit the
forward cascade of energy. The point is that in presence
of forward helicity cascade, reverse cascade of energy is
not impossible.

One can make the argument more concrete using logic
in the line suggested by Fjortoft’s theorem[24] in 2D tur-
bulence. Let the helicity spectrum be H(k) and the en-
ergy spectrum be E(k). It may be shown that

for the rapidly rotating 3D turbulent ﬂow. Direct
experiments[7] by Morize et al. have found energy spec-
trum for rapidly rotating turbulence going as k−2.2 which
is as predicted by the relation (8).

But one question still remains. All the discussion
mainly focused on turbulent ﬂows with low Ro and high
Re. What happens if the turbulent ﬂuid is not rapidly
rotated but is slowly rotated? So, now to answer this
question, lets focus on the slowly rotated isotropic ho-

which are respectively due to the ﬁrst term and the sec-
ond term in the R.H.S. of the relation (19). Obviously,
the spectrum (20) will be dominant compared to the
spectrum (21). But as the Ø is increased, the spec-
trum (21) becomes more and more prominent; thereby
two-dimensionalisation of the 3D homogeneous turbulent
ﬂuid is initiated which then carries over to high rotation
regime. It is very interesting to note that the exponent
(16 + √97)/9, equals
of k in the relation (21), i.e.
2.87 which is in between

2 (for rapidly rotating 3D turbulence as proposed by

Zhou). It hasn’t fallen into the more strict range [-7/3,-
5/3] obviously because Ø is too low and may be because
to maintain isotropy to a certain extent for the sake of
hiccup-free calculations we have chosen not to include a
term proportional to ǫijklo
k in the relation (9) which could
grab the eﬀect of helicity explicitly; thereby again show-
casing the need for the helicity to be eﬀective to give the
right exponent for the rotating turbulence.

Having explained the two signatures of the two-
dimensionalisation eﬀect, we search for another possible
signature of the eﬀect. The advection of a passive scalar
θ may serve the purpose since the Yaglom’s law[27] in
d-D incompressible turbulent ﬂuid may be written as

κ being the diﬀusivity. This law (22) distinguishes be-
tween a 2D and a 3D turbulence and hence it is worth
getting a form for it for a rotating 3D turbulence and ﬁnd
if in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis it reduces
to the form for 2D turbulence and thereby bringing in
the eﬀect of two-dimensionalisation. Since one can show
that small Ø could bring in anisotropy in the otherwise
isotropic scales[25], one would look out for the eﬀect of
small Ø on the passive scalar which follows the equation:

the velocity structure functions.
In future, it is hoped
that a modiﬁed form for the Yaglom’s law in the case
of rapidly rotating turbulent ﬂuid will be derived that
can be treated as a further signature of the eﬀect of the
two-dimensionalisation of 3D turbulence due to rotation.
To conclude, we mention that true reason behind the
so called two-dimensionalisation of turbulence has been
ﬁgured out which accounts for the energy cascade direc-
tion and the energy spectrum found in the experiments
and simulations. To settle the problem more neatly,
study of passive scalars in rotating turbulence may prove
to be of beneﬁt which of course is our future course of
action.

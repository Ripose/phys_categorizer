Abstract

A reﬁned hydro-chemical model for single-bubble sonoluminescence is presented. The processes

of water vapor evaporation and condensation, mass diﬀusion, and chemical reactions are taken into

account. Numerical simulations of Xe-, Ar- and He-ﬁlled bubbles are carried out. The results show

that the trapped water vapor in conjunction with its endothermic chemical reactions signiﬁcantly

reduces the temperature within the bubble so that the degrees of ionization are generally very low.

The chemical radicals generated from water vapor are shown to play an increasingly important role

in the light emission from Xe to He bubbles. Light spectra and pulses computed from an optically

thin model and from an essentially blackbody model are compared with recent experimental results.

It is found that the results of the blackbody model generally match better with the experiment

ones than those of the optically thin model. Suggestions on how to reconcile the conﬂict are given.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery that acoustic energy can be converted to light through an oscillating air

bubble trapped in water [1] has triggered extensive studies on single-bubble sonolumines-

cence (SBSL) (cf. reviews in [2, 3]). Under certain conditions, a stable and regular ﬂash

of blue-white light with a width of about 40-350 ps is emitted during the violent collapse

of the bubble in each acoustic cycle [4, 5, 6]. Among many candidate mechanisms of SBSL

light emission, the model that identiﬁed SBSL light emission as thermal bremsstrahlung

and recombination radiation from an optically thin bubble seemed to predict the widths,

shapes and spectra of the emitted light fairly well under certain simpliﬁed hydrodynamic

frameworks [7, 8, 9]. Similar models included those which used ﬁnite opacity to deﬁne a

variable blackbody core [10, 11], or a sheer blackbody model assuming a ﬁx-sized emission

core [12]. However, diﬀerent approximations in modelling the physical-chemical processes,

and particularly, uncertainties under the extreme conditions inside a sonoluminescing (SL)

bubble, may give diverse predictions that plague the validity of a light emission model.

Therefore, more realistic hydrodynamic-chemical modelling and more critical tests of the

light emission models under the reﬁned hydro-chemical framework are necessary.

Past studies delineated the important eﬀects of diﬀusive transport, surface tension and

compressibility of the surrounding liquid on SBSL [13, 14, 15]. Earlier studies considered the

inﬂuence of evaporation-condensation phenomena on the bubble dynamics [16, 17]. Recently,

the study of sonochemsitry was extending from lower temperature to higher temperature

situations to approach SL problems [18, 19, 20]. Sochard et al. [21] and Gong et al. [19]

coupled the bubble dynamics with the water vapor dissociations. Yasui [18] presented a

model of SBSL that accounts for evaporation-condensation process at the bubble interface

and water vapor chemical reactions. It was later stressed by Storey and Szeri [22] and others

[23, 24, 25, 26] that water vapor reduce the temperatures inside the SL bubble signiﬁcantly

by reducing the compression heating of the mixture and through primarily endothermic

chemical reactions. In some of these models, spatial uniformity of the bubble interior was

assumed and inter-molecular mass diﬀusion was not taken into account. As a consequence,

such models often underpredicted the amount of trapped water vapor during the rapid

collapse.

In the full hydro-chemical numerical study by Storey and Szeri [22], the consequences of

2

water vapor inside strongly forced argon bubbles were investigated in detail. The interaction

of nonlinearity of the volume oscillations, mass diﬀusion, and nonequilibrium phase change

at the bubble wall resulted in excess water vapor trapped in the bubble during the violent

collapse. The amount of trapped water vapor was more than that predicted by the simple

model [18]. Akhatov et al.

[27] accounted for the occurrence of supercritical conditions

of condensation and studied laser-induced cavitation bubbles. The eﬀects of water vapor

diﬀusion in diﬀerent noble gas bubbles were studied by Xu et al. [28], where shock waves

were found to occur only in Xe bubbles. More recently, Toegel et al.

[25] studied the

eﬀects of the highly compressed conditions of SL bubbles on chemical equilibrium constants.

They showed that high temperatures could be recovered due to the suppressed water vapor

dissociations.

In spite of the progress made, the direct consequence of sonochemistry on

existing popular light emission models is to be revealed.

In this paper, we present a reﬁned hydrodynamic model taking into account the chem-

ical reactions and ionizations of the noble gas and water vapor mixture. The model is an

extension of our previous ones [11, 14, 29]. As done in [11], the multispecies Navier-Stokes

(NS) equations for the gas mixture in the bubble interior are coupled with a proper form

of the Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equation for the bubble wall, including the eﬀects of liquid

compressibility and heat transfer. The new feature of the model is that the nonequilibrium

processes of evaporation and condensation, species diﬀusion, noble gas exchange between

the bubble and the surrounding liquid, and dissociations of water vapor and ionizations

of atomic species inside the bubble are all taken into account. The numerical scheme for

solving the hydrodynamic equations is modiﬁed to be a semi-implicit one which allows for

better numerical stability than original explicit scheme in [14].

Detailed formulae in Eulerian framework are given. Numerical simulations are carried out

for bubbles of He, Ar, or Xe gases. The eﬀects of sonochemistry on current light-emitting

models of SBSL [8, 11, 23] are studied in detail through comparison with a calibrated

experiment [12]. The main conclusions are: (i) the chemical reactions reduce the temperature

within the bubble to such an extent that the degrees of ionization are generally very low; (ii)

shock waves do not appear in He or Ar bubbles in the stable SBSL regime, but can occur in

Xe bubbles only at higher driving pressures; (iii) chemical radicals generated from the water

vapor contribute dominantly to the light emission of He bubbles; (iv) based on computed

photon absorption coeﬃcients, the popular optically thin thermal radiation model is less

3

able to ﬁt the experimental light spectra and pulse widths than an essentially blackbody

radiation model with an assumed dynamic blackbody core. Some suggestions on how to

reconcile the contradiction are outlined.

II. HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL

In this section, we extend our previous hydrodynamic model [11, 14] to include processes

of evaporation-condensation on the wall and chemical reactions inside the bubble. The

bubble is still assumed to be spherically symmetric and is composed of the mixture of noble

gas, water vapor and reaction products.

In addition to the NS and RP equations, the

equations for the mass concentration of the dissolved noble gas and for the temperature of

the surrounding water are also solved.

A. Gas dynamics in the bubble

1. The NS equations

The bubble is assumed to contain N-species gas mixture: a noble gas and its ions, water
vapor and its reaction products (N = 13: Ar, Ar+, Ar2+, Ar3+, H2O, OH, H, H+, O, O+,

H2, O2, e−). Chemical reactions of the water vapor and ionizations of atomic species (Ar,

H and O) are considered. The dynamics inside the bubble is described by the compressible

NS equations, which represent the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. They can

be written into a “conservative” form in the spherical coordinates:

2. Transport properties, equation of state and thermodynamic properties

The individual transport properties (viscosity µi, thermal conductivity λi, thermal diﬀu-

sion ratio kT

i and binary diﬀusion coeﬃcient Dij) are generally calculated based on Chapman-

Enskog theory [31, 32, 33]. However, the transport properties of the gas mixture, µ, λ are

5

determined by some empirical combination rules such as Wilke’s semi-empirical formula

[32]. There is also diﬃculty in describing individual µi and Dij for some reaction products

due to lack of data. We shall let unavailable µi and Dij equal to other known ones, e.g.,

µOH = µH2O, µH = µH2. Collision cross-sections of ions, electron and some radical species

that are not available in [31, 32] can be determined using NASA temperature dependent

polynomial ﬁtting [34]. Once µi is known, λi is obtained by modiﬁed Eucken model [31, 32].

The trouble lies in the determination of kT

i . In this regard, we only take into account the
thermal diﬀusion between the most ample species, i.e. between the noble gas and the water

vapor, since thermal diﬀusion is only important in slow stage other than collapse [22, 33].

The high pressure corrections [32] are applied to µi and λi similar to what Xu [28] did. The

transport properties of the mixture, µ and λ, are obtained by using Wilke’s semi-empirical

The hydrodynamics of the bubble is aﬀected by the equation of state. Here the gas

mixture is modelled by a hard-core van der Waals equation of state that has the excluded

3. Chemical kinetics

The chemical kinetics consists of the reaction mechanism and determines the net pro-

duction rate of each species. The present reaction scheme includes both chemical reactions

of water vapor and ionizations of monatomic species. For the chemical reactions of water

vapor, we use the mechanism that were described in detail in [37]. Only a subset consist-

ing of 8 forward and reverse elementary reactions is used, corresponding to the ﬁrst eight

ones used by Yasui [18]. The ﬁrst 19 reactions of [18] with additional species (HO2, H2O2)

were also tried but the results were found to be a little diﬀerent from the 8 reactions. The

collisional ionizations and recombinations are considered only for three monatomic species:

noble gas, H and O. The reasons to choose H and O atoms are that they are quite ample

in the water vapor dissociations, have lower ionization potentials, and can be treated us-

ing previous rate formulae [38]. Although H2O and OH are almost as ample as H and O,

and have lower ionization potentials too, their ionization processes are believed to be more

complicated than a single atom, thus are not accounted for in this study. The maximum

ionization level is taken as 3 for a noble gas, and 1 for H or O atom. The net production

rate due to chemical reactions of the water vapor is determined via the law of mass action:

4. Mass and heat exchange at the bubble wall

The evaporation-condensation process and diﬀusion of the noble gas into the surrounding

liquid are included. The net evaporation rate (mass per unit area and unit time) at the

bubble wall is given as follows [16, 18]

partial pressure of water vapor, and Γ is the correction factor:

In this study, the jump of temperature across the interface is assumed zero, thus Tl,int = Tv,int,

and the accommodation coeﬃcient is calculated as in [18]. Although Eq. (15) is valid only

below a critical point (for water Tcr

647 K), it is used throughout the whole acoustic cycle

for simplicity.

The mass and heat transfer boundary conditions are nonlinear. All the boundary condi-

tions for the gas dynamics have to be coupled with the motion, temperature and noble gas

concentration equations in the surrounding liquid.

B. Motion, heat and mass transport in the liquid

The liquid ﬂow outside the spherical bubble is accounted for with diﬀerent approximations

for motion and heat (or mass) transport, respectively. First, the Euler equation for the

inviscid motion can be reduced to the ordinary diﬀerential equation for the bubble radius

known as the RP equation. The RP equation is coupled with the NS equations through

stress equilibrium condition at the bubble wall. Second, when accounting for heat and mass

transfer in the liquid, we assume that the ﬂuid is incompressible. The separate treatment

reduces the complexity of solving a fully coupled hydrodynamic equations for the outer

liquid at sacriﬁce that shock waves in the liquid can not be simulated well.

Because the mass transfer at the bubble wall results in very small liquid velocity whose
eﬀect on the RP equation can be ignored, we let ul|R = ˙R. Thus we can use a form of the
RP equation [40, 41] that includes ﬁrst order terms in the Mach number M = ˙R/Clb and

allows for variable speed of sound in the water [14, 42]:

Both heat and mass transfer are taken into account although the former is found to be

coordinate transformations [43, 44] with the aid of Eq. (30). The details were given in

[14, 45].

We apply a second-order total-variational-diminishing (TVD) scheme [46] to the inviscid

ﬂux terms and central diﬀerence to the diﬀusive terms of the NS equations. The temporal

discretization diﬀers from [14] in that we now use an Adams-Bashforth explicit scheme for the

convective and spherical coordinate terms, and Crank-Nicolson implicit scheme for diﬀusive

and chemical source terms. The implicit treatment is to overcome the stiﬀness problem due

to diﬀusive transport and chemical source terms. Trapezoidal rule and central diﬀerence are

used for the water temperature and concentration equations. A predictor-corrector method

is used for the RP equation. We use 400 grid points for the NS equations and 100 points

for the water temperature and gas concentration equations.

III. OPTICAL POWER RADIATED BY THE BUBBLE

To see how existing popular light emission models of SBSL behave in the present hy-

drodynamic framework, we select the optically thin model of Hilgenfeldt et al. [8] and the

opacity-corrected blackbody model of Ho et al. [11, 29]. In the later model, the bubble was

intensionally divided into a blackbody core and an optically thin radiating/absorbing outer

shell in a way similar to what Moss et al. did [10, 23]. While the assumption of a blackbody

core might contradict with computed photon mean free path, it just serves to show how a

blackbody model works [12]. We apply the formulae of photon absorption coeﬃcients to
the gas mixture in the bubble. The overall photon absorption coeﬃcient κtot

or an optically thick one is actually used. If Rc=0, it is the optically thin model; if Rc is

large, it is the essentially blackbody model.

then radiation from further interior is completely opaque to an outside observer. If εc = 1,

as generally taken [23], then Rc will always be zero for all present cases, implying fully
optically thin. We intentionally use a much smaller εc (or equivalently, increasing ¯κtot

λ while

keeping εc = 1) so that there is always a ﬁnite blackbody radius Rc for most cases.

It is meaningful to look at the light pulses and spectra. The integration of the spectral

radiance over a suitable wavelength intervals (λUV = 200 nm

λr = 800 nm) gives the total

power emitted into the measurable part of the spectrum, and integration over one acoustic

It is well known that the ambient bubble radius R0 depends on experimentally controllable

parameters such as the driving pressure amplitude Pa, the water temperature T∞, the gas

concentration dissolved in the water c∞. A problem with past SL spectrum measurements

was they seldom gave the key parameters Pa and R0 at the same time. The theoretical studies

had to ﬁt experimental data using diﬀerent Pa and R0. The present study tries to use the

same parameters as those in previous literatures. For comparison with other calculations,

the parameters used here are Pa = 1.2 bar, T∞ = 298 K and Pa = 1.35 atm, T∞ = 300 K

for identical equilibrium radius R0 = 4.5 µm and driving frequency f = 26.5 kHz, and

Pa = 1.4 bar for R0 = 6.0 µm, f = 20.6 kHz, T∞ = 293.15 K, the dissolved gas concentration

is c∞/c0 = 0.395% (3 torr partial pressure). The former two cases, Pa = 1.2 bar and

1.35 atm correspond to computational examples in Storey [22] and Xu [28], while the third

case Pa = 1.4 bar corresponds to that in Moss [23]. For comparison with experiments [12],

R0 = 4.5 µm (He), 5.5 µm (Xe), f = 42 kHz, T∞ = 296.15 K, noble gas dissolved at 150

torr (He), 3 torr (Xe), while Pa is adjustable. Other parameters are: P∞ = 101325 Pa,
ρl∞ = 996.6 kg m−3, kl = 0.609 W m−1 K−1 and CPl = 4179 J kg−1 K−1, Dl = 2
10−9 m2/s.

The van der Waals excluded volumes are given in Table I. Initial number densities of ions

and electrons are estimated using the Saha equation [47]. The initial bubble content contains

2% molar fraction water vapor. This number seems arbitrary, but our results are based on

the second acoustic cycle when initial disturbances are presumed to be decayed.

A. Eﬀects of chemical reactions

Fig. 1 shows one forcing period of the radius of an argon bubble corresponding to cases

I to III in [22]. One can see that the diﬀerence between II and III are small, but the

diﬀerence between I and the latter two is large. The existence of water vapor increases the

maximum radius and delays the collapse. In spite of little diﬀerence between II and III in

14

R

t curves, large diﬀerence occurs for thermodynamic variables at collapse. Table II shows

−

comparison of some quantities. The maximum radius of the present calculation is smaller

than that of Story [22]. This is mainly because the acoustic forcing terms in Eq.(23) is

separate from Hb rather than absorbed in P∞ as treated in [22, 33] that magniﬁed Pa by a

factor of n/(n

1) (see Eq.(25)). Since there are much diﬀerences between the present model

−

and Storey’s, quantitative discrepancies are expectable for the extreme values. Both models

predicted temperature reduction from case I to III. However, the present result show that

temperature is slightly reduced from I to II, but heavily from II to III. The slight reduction

is due to the compensating eﬀects of increased compression ratio (Rmax/Rmin) and reduced

ratio of speciﬁc heats [22]. The larger reduction from 17000 K (case II) to 8900 K (case III)

indicates the signiﬁcant eﬀects of chemical reactions of the trapped water vapor.

The eﬀects of chemical reactions on thermodynamic variables are best reﬂected in the

distributions of temperature and chemical yields inside the bubble. Fig. 2 shows snapshots of

the spatial proﬁles of temperature around the moment of minimum bubble radius. It can be

seen that temperatures are considerably reduced in the bubble interior in the reacting case

III. Fig. 3 shows the numbers of molecules of diﬀerent species and temperature at the bubble

center as a function of time around the instant of minimum bubble radius. Note that in

the ﬁrst acoustic cycle the water vapor begins to dissociate appreciably at t =

2
−

∼ −

1 ns,

while in the beginning of the second cycle there are already some amounts of H2 and O2

gases accumulated. The chemical reactions occur in a time scale of several nanoseconds,

producing considerable amounts of H, O, OH radicals and H2 and O2 gases. It is remarked

that the prediction of chemical products is very diﬃcult as the reaction mechanisms and

phase change processes are largely unknown under extreme conditions in a SL bubble.

15

Next we compare a R0 = 6.0 µm Ar bubble driven at Pa = 1.4 bar. This case was labelled

as A1 in [23]. The present temperatures at the bubble center are 109600 K, 34700 K, and

16200 K for the three cases similar to I

III in Fig. 1, thus it is seen that both the

∼

reduced ratio of speciﬁc heats due to the presence of water vapor and the chemical reactions

contribute signiﬁcantly to the reduction of temperatures for this higher Pa case. The amount

of trapped water vapor at the moment of Rmin for case II occupies 23% molar fraction, smaller

than 33 % [22]. Fig. 4 shows several snapshots of the spatial proﬁles of thermodynamic

variables around the moment of minimum bubble radius. A main feature in Fig. 4 is that

only compression waves occur. As seen from the velocity proﬁle, a compression wave moves

outward at t4 and t5, reﬂects from the bubble wall and moves inward at t6. No shock waves

are developed. This result is diﬀerent from that of Moss et al

[23], where shock waves

were reported. Possible reason is that the formation of a shock is sensitive to diﬀerences

in equations of state, accommodation coeﬃcients, chemical reactions, and treatments of the

liquid motion and so on. Another feature in Fig. 4 is that temperature in the inner zone

of the bubble is reduced more severely than in the outer zone at t1, t2, t7 and t8 when the

compression wave is not strong. This is because considerable water vapor is trapped in the

inner zone of an Ar bubble as a result of thermal diﬀusion [28, 33] and reacts there, thus

peak temperature is not at the center, but at some place close to the bubble interface. For

a lighter-than-water-vapor gas bubble such as He bubble, less water vapor is congregated in

the central zone, and temperature peak will be located at the bubble center (will be shown

in Fig. 6 (b)). Fig. 5 shows one snapshot of the number density distributions at the moment

of minimum bubble radius. It can be seen that the amounts of products due to chemical

reactions are ten orders of magnitude larger than those due to ionizations, and the number
densities of H+ and O+ exceed that of Ar+. Therefore, the degrees of ionization is quite low,

which is in contrast to our earlier results when water vapor was not taken into account [11].

The comparative study in this subsection demonstrates that the trapped water vapor

and ensuing endothermic chemical reactions signiﬁcantly reduce the temperature, and that

the number densities of typical ions are very small. This suggests that a few percent degree

of ionization is not likely to occur in an Ar bubble. Regardless how actually the degree of

ionization will be, the chemical reactions of water vapor can produce considerable amounts

of radicals and molecular species, some of which such as H and O atoms are easier to ionize

than a noble gas such as He or Ar. This has signiﬁcant impact on SBSL mechanism as will

16

be shown in subsection C.

B. Eﬀects of noble gas types

Previous numerical studies pointed that shock formation depends sensitively on, among

other factors [14], the amount of water vapor [23, 28] and its distribution [22]. Xu et al. [28]

showed that shock waves develop in a bubble ﬁlled with 70% Xe and 30% (mole fractions)

water vapor, but no shocks occur for similarly ﬁlled Ar or He bubbles. With evaporation-

condensation process and chemical reactions taken into account, we are able to investigate

eﬀects of noble gases on the thermodynamic processes more realistically. We calculated Xe,

Ar and He bubbles using the same R0, Pa, f , and T∞ as those of Xu [28].

Fig. 6(a) and (b) show snapshots of the spatial proﬁles of thermodynamic variables around

the moment of minimum bubble radius for Xe and He bubbles. Snapshots of Ar bubble are

similar to those in Fig. 4, thus are not shown here. In Xe bubble (Fig. 6(a)), it is seen that

an inward-going compression wave at t2 evolves into a strong outward-going shock at t3. It

is found that the ﬁrst focusing of the shock happened between t2 and t3 leads to extreme
high temperatures (> 106 K), but the duration is very short (< 1 ps) and the region is

conﬁned to the center (r < 0.005 µm). On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) shows that only weak

compression waves occur in He bubble. Therefore, the present result indicates that shock

waves occur in Xe bubble, in agreement with Xu et al.’s result. Note that the temperature

peaks are often at the center in He bubble except when a wavy disturbance reﬂects from the

bubble wall at t4. This feature results mainly from the thermal diﬀusion between the noble

gas and the water vapor.

Fig. 7(a) and (b) show one snapshot of the number density distributions at the moment

of minimum bubble radius for Xe and He bubbles. There are signiﬁcant amounts of chemical

products for both bubbles, especially H, O, OH, and H2. The right ﬁgure in Fig. 7(a) shows

that atoms in Xe bubble are ionized appreciably in a very small zone (r < 10%R). However,

Fig. 7(b) shows that the amounts of ion species in He bubble are as little as the orders of
the ﬂuctuating numerical roundoﬀ errors. The number density of H+ or O+ is comparable
to that of Xe+, but far exceeds that of He+. The situation for Ar bubble is found to be in

between. The gradually increased portions of trapped water vapor (both in number density

and mass fraction) from Xe, Ar to He bubbles, indicate that the chemical products from

17

water vapor, most probably H and O, may play an increasingly important role in SBSL from

Xe to He bubbles.

C. Calculated light spectra and pulses

In this subsection, we shall compute the emitted lights by using (33) with εc = 1 for the

optically thin model and a smaller, adjustable εc for the essentially blackbody model. We

compare our calculations with Fig. 2 of a recalibrated experiment [12]: R0 = 4.5 µm (He)

and 5.5 µm (Xe), f = 42 kHz, T∞ = 296.15 K, noble gases dissolved at 150 torr (He) and 3

torr (Xe). We let driving pressure amplitude Pa and εc in (35) be ﬁtting parameters.

Fig. 8 shows comparison of the spectral radiances. It is seen that the essentially blackbody

matches well with the experimental spectrum of Xe bubble, but the optically thin model

does not so. The ﬁtting Pa = 1.28 atm of the essentially blackbody is within the stable SBSL

range, while the ﬁtting Pa = 1.55 atm of the optically thin model seems to be out of the stable

range. For the former, only a weak compression wave occurs, and the maximum temperature

is 8600 K, while for the latter, a shock wave appears and the maximum temperature can
105 K. However, it can be seen that either models are unable to ﬁt the spectrum

be 9.4

×

of He bubble. The essentially blackbody seems better than the optically thin model as the

latter deviates far from the experiment. The blackbody ﬁtting at Pa = 1.45 atm results in

a maximum temperature of 16700 K, while the optically thin ﬁtting at Pa = 2.0 atm results

in a one of 53000 K.

Fig. 9 compares the time variations of the normalized power for the “measurable”, “UV”

(300-400 nm) and “red” (590-650 nm) wavelength intervals [4]. Both light emission models

show good wave-length independence of light pulse, a key ingredient of SBSL thought by

several researchers [4, 8]. The essentially blackbody model gives a FWHM of 185 ps for Xe

bubble, and 18 ps for He bubble. On the other hand, the optically thin model gives a FWHM

of 26 ps for Xe bubble, and 13 ps for He bubble. The experimental ﬂash widths are 200 ps

(Xe) and 100 ps (He) [12]. Again, it is seen that the light pulse width of Xe bubble could

be approximately ﬁt by the blackbody model, while that of He bubble could not. Fig. 10

shows the variations of the blackbody core and bubble radius with time. One can see that

the blackbody core appears, attains maximum at the moment of minimum bubble radius,

and disappears.

18

Fig. 11(a) and (b) show the total visible light powers of the blackbody model versus

time for Xe and He bubbles. An important feature is that the chemical products contribute

dominantly to the total power for He bubble, and considerably for Xe bubble, which is

suggested by the gap between the total power and the contribution from the noble gas and

water vapor. Particularly, H and O radicals are found to be dominant for the light power of

He bubble. The numerical results seem to support previous postulation that light emission

from radicals generated from water vapor dissociation may dominate SBSL in He bubble in

water [8]. However, it must be noted that the predicted spectrum and pulse width for He

bubble by using both models do not agree well with the experimental ones.

The failure of the thermal radiation model to match with the experiment as using the

faithfully computed photon absorption coeﬃcients and the improvement as using an as-

sumed blackbody core raise contradiction. The bubble interior was found to be optically

thin based on the computed photon absorption coeﬃcient. What could be conjectured was

if there existed an unknown mechanism that would increase the photon absorption coef-

ﬁcient of the highly compressed bubble content [3, 12].

It may be possible in some way

to obtain a partially blackbody zone. One way is to have better theories to compute the

photon absorption coeﬃcients of a very dense gas mixture. Other ways resort to reducing

hydrodynamic modelling uncertainties. These uncertainties include: (i) the evaporation-

condensation process, which aﬀects the trapped amount of water vapor, (ii) the chemical

and ionization processes under high pressure and high density conditions, which aﬀects the

number densities of ions and electrons, and (iii) the surrounding liquid motion, which aﬀects

how much kinetic energy is delivered to the bubble and radiated outward. Light emission

processes from chemical products also need to be explored.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A reﬁned hydro-chemical model is presented to simulate the complex processes inside a

sonoluminescing bubble. The model takes into account of water vapor evaporation and con-

densation at the bubble wall, heat and mass transfer between the bubble and the surrounding

water, and chemical reactions of water vapor and ionizations of atomic species.

The numerical simulations of Xe, Ar and He bubbles indicate that the trapped water

vapor and its endothermic reactions reduce the temperature signiﬁcantly.

In the stable

19

SBSL range, at most compression waves can appear in He or Ar bubbles, while shock waves

can occur in Xe bubbles only for higher driving amplitudes. The lower temperature in the

bubble rarely leads to appreciable ionization, except for Xe bubble at the center during the

shock wave focusing. The chemical reactions of water vapor produce signiﬁcant amount of

radicals. These radicals become increasingly important in the light emission from Xe to He

bubbles. Particularly, H and O radicals are thought to be dominant light-emitting matters.

The most noticeable result of this study is that the optically thin thermal emission model

is unable to match with the experiment mainly due to the reduced temperatures in the

bubble. The adoption of a modiﬁed chemical equilibrium constant for a van der Waals gas

is found to raise the temperature to some extent, but not high enough to alter the above

conclusion. The introduction of an optically thick region makes the calculated light spectra

and pulse widths match better with the experimental for some cases. The present expertise

to deﬁne an optically thick region is only meant to show potential improvement of theories

in this direction. Remedies to achieve blackbody eﬀects, such as reduction of modelling un-

certainties and perhaps correction to the absorption coeﬃcient under the extreme conditions

of sonoluminescence, are worthy of further investigation.

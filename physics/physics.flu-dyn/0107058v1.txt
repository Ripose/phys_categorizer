Abstract

Weakly nonlinear hexagon convection patterns coupled to mean ﬂow are investi-
gated within the framework of coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations. The equations
are in particular relevant for non-Boussinesq Rayleigh-B´enard convection at low
Prandtl numbers. The mean ﬂow is found to (1) aﬀect only one of the two long-
wave phase modes of the hexagons and (2) suppress the mixing between the two
phase modes. As a consequence, for small Prandtl numbers the transverse and the
longitudinal phase instability occur in suﬃciently distinct parameter regimes that
they can be studied separately. Through the formation of penta-hepta defects, they
lead to diﬀerent types of transient disordered states. The results for the dynamics
of the penta-hepta defects shed light on the persistence of grain boundaries in such
disordered states.

1 Introduction

Roll patterns in Rayleigh-B´enard convection of a ﬂuid layer heated from below
have been explored extensively over the years as a paradigmatic system to
study the succession of transitions from ordered to disordered and eventually
turbulent states (for a recent review see [1]). Substantial theoretical eﬀort has
been devoted to identifying all the linear instabilities that straight roll patterns
can undergo (e.g. [2]). Depending on the wavenumber of the roll pattern,
the temperature diﬀerence across the layer (Rayleigh number), and the ﬂuid

properties (Prandtl number) a host of instabilities has been identiﬁed. The
main instabilities being the Eckhaus, zig-zag, cross-roll, oscillatory, and skew-
varicose instabilities. They limit the band of stable wavenumbers of straight
rolls (Busse balloon). It turns out that the oscillatory and the skew-varicose
instabilities depend sensitively on the Prandtl number and are relevant only
if the Prandtl number is suﬃciently small [2].

For small convection amplitudes a weakly nonlinear description in terms of a
Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation [3,4] would be expected to be suﬃcient at
least for almost straight roll patterns. However, it is found that this is true
only in the limit of large Prandtl numbers. It has been shown that slightly
curved roll patterns drive a mean ﬂow. Because of the incompressibility of
the ﬂuid it induces a non-local coupling of the rolls, which is not contained
in the Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation [5]. The strength of the mean ﬂow
increases with decreasing Prandtl number. For small Prandtl numbers the
Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation has therefore been extended to include an
equation for the vertical vorticity characterizing the mean ﬂow [5].

Experimentally, the mean ﬂow has been observed in experiments in a rela-
tively small circular container [6]. Since the usual boundary conditions re-
quire the convection rolls to be essentially perpendicular to the side-walls the
rolls become strongly curved in this geometry. The resulting mean ﬂow has
been identiﬁed as the driving force for the observed persistent creation and
annihilation of dislocations [7–9].

Arguably the most interesting state that is due to the mean ﬂow associated
with small Prandtl numbers is the spiral-defect chaos observed in large-aspect
ratio experiments on thin gas layers [10]. It is characterized by the appearance
of various types of defects in the pattern with small rotating spirals being the
ones that are visually most striking. Spiral-defect chaos does not arise from a
linear instability of the straight roll pattern and, in fact, bistability of straight
roll patterns and spiral-defect chaos has been observed experimentally [11].
The onset of spiral-defect chaos depends strongly on the Prandtl number,
indicating that mean ﬂows play an essential role in maintaining this state
[12–15].

Motivated by the strong impact of mean ﬂows on roll convection patterns we
consider in this paper the eﬀect of such ﬂows on the stability and dynamics
of hexagonal patterns. Hexagonal patterns are commonly found in spatially
extended non-equilibrium systems such as non-Boussinesq Rayleigh-B´enard
convection (e.g. [16]), Marangoni convection (e.g. [17]), Turing structures in
chemical systems [18], crystal growth (e.g. [19]), and surface waves on ver-
tically vibrated liquid or granular layers (Faraday experiment) [20,21]. Not
in all of these systems mean ﬂows of the type discussed above arise. Clearly,
they are relevant for the small Prandtl numbers in gas convection in very

2

thin layers [10]. Interestingly, the skewed-varicose instability and a (transient)
state similar to spiral-defect chaos have been observed also in vertically vi-
brated granular layers [22,23]. Since in convection at low Prandtl numbers
they are a signature of the importance of mean ﬂow, mean ﬂow may also be
relevant in vertically vibrated ﬂuids. We focus in this paper on patterns aris-
ing from a steady bifurcation, as is the case in convection. Immediately above
onset, parametrically excited standing waves like those arising in the Faraday
experiment behave in many respects like patterns that are due to a steady
bifurcation (e.g. [24]). Our results may therefore also be relevant for hexagon
patterns in suitable Faraday experiments.

In the absence of mean ﬂows the stability of hexagonal patterns has been
studied in detail in the weakly nonlinear regime. Starting from three coupled
Ginzburg-Landau-type equations for the amplitudes of the rolls that make up
the hexagonal pattern two coupled phase equations have been derived that
describe the dynamics of long-wave deformations of the hexagon patterns [25–
28]. In these theoretical analyses two types of long-wave instabilities have been
identiﬁed, a longitudinal and a transverse mode, with the longitudinal mode
being relevant only for Rayleigh numbers very close to the saddle-node bifur-
cation at which the hexagons ﬁrst appear. In a more detailed analysis also
perturbations with arbitrary wavenumber and simulations of the nonlinear
evolution ensuing from the instabilities have been included [29]. The insta-
bilities typically lead to the formation of penta-hepta defects [30,31]. Their
dynamics and interaction has also been studied in the absence of mean ﬂows
[32,33]. In the strongly nonlinear regime long-wave perturbations are still cap-
tured by phase equations [28]. Speciﬁcally for convection at large Prandtl num-
bers driven by a combination of buoyancy and surface tension the stability of
hexagons and their dynamics has been investigated in [34]. Experimentally,
the stability of hexagonal convection patterns has not been studied in detail.
A contributing factor has been that controlled changes in the wavenumber
of the pattern are considerably more diﬃcult to eﬀect than in systems like
Taylor-vortex ﬂow, where detailed agreement between experiment and theory
has been achieved (e.g. [35,36]). Recently, however, it has been possible to
use localized heating as a printing technique for convection patterns [37,38].
This will make detailed analyses of the wavenumber-dependent instabilities of
hexagon patterns experimentally accessible.

The goal of this study is to investigate the linear stability of hexagons coupled
to a two-dimensional mean ﬂow driven by modulations of the pattern and
the nonlinear evolution arising from the instabilities. An example of the ﬂow
generated by two typical patterns is shown in ﬁg.1a,b. In ﬁg.1a a periodic
hexagon pattern is sinusoidally modulated on a length scale ﬁve times the
hexagon size and ﬁg.1b shows the mean ﬂow generated by a penta-hepta defect.
The mean ﬂow is found to couple only to one of the two long-wave modes. As
a consequence, for suﬃciently small Prandtl numbers each of the two long-

wavelength) than is appropriate for the weakly nonlinear theory presented in this
paper.

wave instabilities dominates in a separate, experimentally accessible parameter
regime. Both instabilities induce the formation of defects. We study their
motion and brieﬂy touch upon its impact on disordered patterns and grain
boundaries.

The paper is organized as follows: ﬁrst we formulate the problem extending
previous work on the mean ﬂow generated by roll convection [39,40]. We then
study the stability of the hexagonal pattern with respect to long-wave pertur-
bations (sec.3) and with respect to general side-band perturbations (sec.4). In
section 5 the nonlinear evolution of the instabilities including the formation,
dynamics, and annihilation of defects is investigated. There, we also study the
transition from hexagonal to roll patterns triggered by the side-band instabil-
ities.

2 Amplitude equations

The interaction between weakly nonlinear convection rolls and the mean ﬂow
generated by them has been investigated for Rayleigh-B´enard convection with
both no-slip and stress-free boundary conditions at the top and bottom plate
[39,40]. The relevant amplitude equations were derived and used to determine
the stability of rolls with respect to side-band instabilities. Expanding the
ﬂuid velocity in terms of the complex amplitude A of the convection rolls and

For the description of hexagonal convection patterns coupled to the mean
ﬂow the treatment has to be extended to include rolls in other directions
than the x-axis. Using a coordinate transformation, it is straightforward to

the extension of eqs.(2,3) from roll to hexagonal patterns we also add non-
Boussinesq quadratic terms. For no-slip boundary conditions, the minimal set

longitudinal spatial variable in the direction of ˆni and of the transverse variable
in the direction of ˆτi can be implemented in the hexagonal case where these
directions are diﬀerent for each of the three hexagon modes. We therefore

rates like that of the zig-zag instability (e.g. [41,42]). Then higher-order terms
have to be re-introduced. For the hexagonal patterns this is, however, not the
case. Note that while there is no direct damping of transverse variations, each
of the Aj is still allowed to vary in its respective transverse direction. This
variation induces a variation in the longitudinal direction of the other two
modes, in particular through the resonant interaction term A∗
j+1, which
then induces damping.

As usual, the hexagon solution given by equation (7) with a minus sign in
front of the square root is not stable. Thus, in the following we focus on the
hexagon solution with the plus sign.

Since the mean ﬂow couples to hexagons only through a modulation in the
amplitudes, the stationary states (6-8) with constant amplitudes are also so-
lutions to equations (4,5). However, their stability is modiﬁed by the coupling
to the mean ﬂow. In the case of rolls it can lead to an oscillatory instabil-
ity (oscillatory skew-varicose instability), implying that there is no Lyapunov
functional when taking the mean ﬂow into account.

We conduct a linear stability analysis of the hexagonal pattern (7) in the
long-wave limit following the procedures in [26]. The amplitudes are perturbed

As expected from equation (25), the mean ﬂow only aﬀects the transverse
mode. It shifts the associated stability boundary of the hexagons and makes
it asymmetric in q. The sign of β determines whether the mean ﬂow desta-
bilizes the transverse mode for positive or for negative wavenumbers. For roll
convection with no-slip boundary conditions β is always negative [39] and its
dependence on the Prandtl number is shown in ﬁgure 2. We note that β

cross-over from longitudinal to transverse mode (thick dashed-dotted).

The stability boundaries for inﬁnite Prandtl number (no mean ﬂow) are re-
viewed in ﬁgure 3. Hexagons exist above the thin solid line (v = 0). The thick
solid line and the dotted line are the stability boundaries for the longitudi-
nal and transverse modes, respectively. Along the thick dashed line, rolls and
hexagons have the same value of the Lyapunov functional. Hexagons become
unstable to rolls (via the unstable mixed mode (8)) at the thin dashed line
(u = 0). Note that since we have scaled the coeﬃcient of the quadratic nonlin-
earity in (4,5) to 1, this transition occurs at µ = 4. For weak non-Boussinesq
eﬀects this corresponds to very small convection amplitudes. As discussed be-
low (see also sec.4), the decomposition into transverse and longitudinal mode
does not hold beyond the long-wave limit. It is replaced by a separation into a
‘wide-splitting’ and a ‘narrow-splitting’ mode [29]. The dashed-dotted line sep-
arates the regions in which the wide-splitting and the narrow-splitting mode
represents the mode with maximal growth rate, respectively. In view of the
eﬀect of the mean ﬂow it is worth noting that the regime in which the longi-
tudinal mode is the relevant destabilizing mode is typically extremely small
(below dashed-dotted line in ﬁg.3) and it is very diﬃcult to investigate that
instability experimentally. In fact, even in numerical simulations of (4) (with
β = 0) we found it diﬃcult to separate the dynamics of the two modes (see
also [29]). Note that due to the scaling of the quadratic coeﬃcient in (4,5) the
usually small range over which hexagons can be observed extends from µ
0
to µ

the transverse mode. The corresponding stability limits are denoted by thick
dotted, dashed and dashed-dotted lines for β = 0, β =
3.0,
respectively. The thick solid line gives the stability limit due to the longitudinal
mode, which is independent of β. For all values of β it is the relevant instability
immediately above the saddle-node bifurcation at which the hexagons ﬁrst
arise (cf. ﬁg.4c). For somewhat larger values of µ the transverse mode becomes
relevant as well. In the physically relevant case, β < 0, it is destabilized by
the mean ﬂow for positive q strongly reducing the stability balloon there.
While for large Prandtl numbers the cross-over from the longitudinal to the
transverse mode is almost imperceptible in the stability limit itself, it occurs
very suddenly when the mean ﬂow is important. This behavior has also been
found in fully nonlinear stability calculations of hexagonal convection in non-

−

11

Boussinesq convection [46]. For q < 0 the transverse mode is stabilized by the
mean ﬂow. This allows the longitudinal mode to become important again for
larger µ. In fact, for suﬃciently large β the transverse mode does not contribute
to the stability limits at low q for any value of µ (cf. dashed-dotted line for
β =
3 in ﬁg.4b). Thus, for small Prandtl numbers the mean ﬂow makes
it possible to investigate the two instabilities separately. In sec.5.1 below we
discuss the diﬀerent nonlinear behavior arising from the two instabilities.

The leading-order phase equation (24) is isotropic. Only at higher order in
the gradients this symmetry is reduced to that of the underlying hexagon
pattern. Similarly, at higher orders (i.e. for larger magnitudes of the perturba-
tion wavevector) the eigenmodes of the phase equation are not expected to be
purely transverse or longitudinal any more. In sec.4 we determine the charac-
ter of the destabilizing modes numerically for ﬁnite perturbation wavevectors,
but only for speciﬁc values of the parameters. To obtain more general results
for the inﬂuence of the mean ﬂow on the destabilizing modes we derive here
the phase equation to ﬁfth order.

If only one of the two modes is unstable the coupled phase equations can
be reduced to a single equation for the unstable mode [26]. It is obtained by
eliminating the stable mode adiabatically. Since both modes are long-wave
modes satisfying diﬀusion-like equations the elimination introduces non-local
terms in the equation for the unstable mode. To demonstrate more explic-
itly the breaking of the isotropy and the mixing of the two modes we derive
the coupled ﬁfth-order equations for both components of the phase vector ~φ.
This can be done systematically in the vicinity of the codimension-two point
(q(ct), µ(ct)) where both σl and σt are zero to cubic order (cf. (27,29)). There the
orientation of the eigenmodes depends solely on the ﬁfth-order terms. Away
from the codimension-two point it is determined by the competition between
the cubic and the ﬁfth-order terms.

To facilitate the analysis we restrict to cases of weak mean ﬂow and expand in

A brief summary of the derivation and the full nonlinear phase equations (for
β = 0) are included in the appendix. Similar to the nonlinear phase equations
derived in [26], eqs.(31,32) are non-local. Here, however, the reason for this is
the nonlocal eﬀect of the mean ﬂow: for β = 0 the equations become local.

The mixing between the transverse and the longitudinal modes can be quan-
tiﬁed by the angle ψ between the phase vector ~φ and the wave vector ~k of the

that, because δψ(1,2)

the mean ﬂow always suppresses the mixing between the two modes. Thus,
the phase perturbations are closer to the pure transverse/longitudinal modes
for small Prandtl number. This is also found for parameters away from the
codimension-two points (see ﬁg.6 below).

4 General Linear Stability Analysis

In this section we present results from solving the linear-stability equations
(14 - 19) numerically for arbitrary perturbation wavenumbers. We ﬁrst review
and discuss the results for inﬁnite Prandtl number [25,29,27]. The long-wave
analysis of sec.3 revealed two phase instabilities associated with the longi-
tudinal and the transverse phase mode, respectively. For ﬁnite perturbation
wavenumbers these two modes become mixed and the eigenmodes of the linear
stability problem are not strictly longitudinal or transverse any more. Instead
they can be characterized by the angle θ between the perturbation wavevector
of the fastest growing modes and ~n1. For the ‘wide-splitting’ modes θ = nπ/3,
whereas for the ‘narrow-splitting’ modes θ = π/6+nπ/3 with n an integer [29].
The terminology refers to the fact that the angle between the relevant most
unstable wide-splitting modes is 2π/3, whereas for the narrow-splitting modes
it is only π/3 [29]. As the perturbation wavenumber goes to 0 the narrow-
splitting mode turns into the longitudinal mode and the wide-splitting mode
into the transverse phase mode. This is illustrated in ﬁg.6, which shows the
angle ψ (eq.(33)) as a function of the angle θ between ~k and ~n1. The thin
lines refer to the case β = 0 discussed here. The deviation of the destabilizing
modes from these orientations increases with

Numerical simulations show that the nonlinear evolution of the narrow- and of
the wide-splitting modes leads to qualitatively diﬀerent transient patterns with
the wide-splitting mode inducing noticeably more grain boundaries between
hexagon patterns of diﬀerent orientation and consequently a larger number
of defects than the narrow-splitting mode [29]. However, as ﬁg.3 already sug-
gests, the range of parameters over which the longitudinal/narrow-splitting
mode dominates over the transverse/wide-splitting mode is very small and it
is very diﬃcult to separate the two modes in numerical simulations [29]. This
is illustrated further in ﬁg.7 and in ﬁg.8. Fig.7 gives the cross-over line from

growth rates of both modes are equal. Fig.8a shows the dependence of the
maximal growth rate of the dominating mode as a function of the control pa-
rameter µ for three values of the wavenumber. Fig.8b shows the dependence
of the wavenumber of the perturbation mode with maximal growth rate. As
expected for a long-wave instability, the magnitude of the wavenumber of the
0.6
fastest growing mode goes to 0 as the stability limits are reached at µ
and µ
1.2 for q = 0.35. Although the relevant perturbation wavenumber
jumps by almost a factor of 2 across the transition from the narrow-splitting
0.4 for q = 0.6), it turns out
to the wide-splitting mode (cf. the jump at µ
that in simulations this diﬀerence is very hard to identify because the growth
rates of the two modes are so similar and the narrow-splitting mode dominates
only over such a small range of µ.

The mean ﬂow introduces a number of modiﬁcations in the stability behavior.
The linear operator
becomes non-hermitian and allows complex eigenval-
ues. It turns out, however, that in our calculations complex eigenvalues appear
only near the stability boundary of the mixed mode (µ = µM M ) and beyond
the long-wave stability limit given by the longitudinal mode (cf. ﬁg.4). In nu-
merical simulations, the transient oscillations were always accompanied by the
formation of defects and an eventual transition to rolls. Possibly, the mean ﬂow
induces more relevant oscillatory instabilities in combination with nonlinear
gradient terms, which also constitute non-potential terms [47,48].

The mixing between the longitudinal and the transverse mode for ﬁnite values
of k persists in the presence of mean ﬂow. It is, however, strongly suppressed,
consistent with our analytical results for the vicinity of the codimension-two
point (cf. eq.(34)). This is illustrated in ﬁg.6, where the thick lines give the
angle ψ of the phase vector for β =
0.2. The diﬀerence between the growth
rates of the narrow- and of the wide-splitting modes is still quite small for

ﬁg.9, which shows the maximal growth rates and the associated wavenumbers
0.6 using solid and dashed lines, respectively, for
for q = +0.6 and for q =
diﬀerent coupling strengths. For larger values of µ, however, even moderate
values of the coupling enhance the diﬀerence noticeably. Thus, for βq < 0 the
wide-splitting mode becomes much more dominant. For βq > 0 the narrow-
splitting mode, which in the absence of mean ﬂow is only relevant in a very
narrow range of the control parameter near the saddle-node bifurcation, be-
comes dominant again above a critical value of µ. This reﬂects the asymmetry
of the stability boundaries induced by the mean ﬂow as shown in ﬁg.4a,b.
The critical value of µ decreases with decreasing Prandtl number, and below
0.4), the transverse mode is preempted by the
Prandtl number
longitudinal mode over the whole range of µ. This suggests again that for suf-
ﬁciently small Prandtl numbers it should be experimentally possible to study
the two instability modes separately.

5 Numerical simulation

We now present results from numerical simulations of eqs.(4,5) using a parallel
pseudo-spectral code. In sec.5.1 we compare the nonlinear evolution of the
transverse and longitudinal side-band instabilities. We then discuss the impact
of the mean ﬂow on the competition between rolls and hexagons. In sec.5.2 we
study the motion of penta-hepta defects in the presence of mean ﬂow. These
results shed some light on the persistence of grain boundaries in disordered

17

hexagons patterns.

5.1 Nonlinear Evolution of the Side-band Instabilities

Transverse vs. longitudinal modes.

Without mean ﬂow the nonlinear evolution of the two side-band instabilities of
hexagon patterns has been studied numerically in some detail by Sushchik and
Tsimring [29]. They ﬁnd that both instabilities lead to the formation of penta-
hepta defects and subsequently to disordered hexagon patterns. When only the
wide-splitting perturbations are growing the emerging patterns have many
grain boundaries separating domains of hexagons with diﬀerent orientation.
These disordered patterns persisted for a long time. When the narrow-splitting
instability is dominant only few such domains appear and a regular hexagon
pattern with a diﬀerent wavenumber is restored within a relatively short time.
Sushchik and Tsimring note that numerical simulations in the regime in which
the narrow-splitting mode is the only destabilizing mode are very diﬃcult and
only present results for parameter values for which also the wide-splitting
mode is destabilizing albeit to a lesser degree. These runs correspond to a
quench deep into the unstable regime beyond the dashed-dotted line in ﬁg.3
(q = 0.56 and µ = 0.6). The authors associate the larger number of grain
boundaries in the ﬁrst case with the large angle between the components of
the wide-splitting mode. A detailed comparison is diﬃcult since no simulations
are available in which only the narrow-splitting mode is active.

As discussed in sec.3 and sec.4, the mean ﬂow couples only to the transverse/wide-
splitting instability and for suﬃciently small Prandtl number suppresses it
completely for βq > 0. This makes it possible to compare the two instabilities
in detail under comparable conditions. Figs.10-12 show a comparison of the
evolution of the two instabilities for µ = 0.5, ν = 2, and β =
3. The system
size is L = 104 and the numerical resolution is 256
256. The wavenumbers
of the initial, slightly perturbed regular hexagon patterns are chosen care-
fully to obtain the same linear growth rates for both modes. In particular, for
0.48 (q = 0.17) only the longitudinal (transverse) mode is destabilizing
q =

(cf. ﬁg.4).

Fig.10 shows the early evolution of the instabilities in terms of the contour lines
of the real and imaginary parts of the three amplitudes Ai, i = 1, 2, 3. While
the longitudinal mode shown in the top three panels induces compressions and
dilations of the pattern, the transverse mode shears the amplitudes. Both lead
to the formation of defects. However, the defects induced by the longitudinal
mode are typically aligned along the rolls and form where the bulges are
maximal.

The temporal evolution of the number of defects is shown in ﬁg.11. For both
modes, we deﬁne t = 0 when the ﬁrst defect is formed. Both modes having
the same growth rate it is not surprising that in both cases the defect number
grows on a similar time scale. In fact, both reach roughly the same number of
defects at about the same time t
50. In both cases the subsequent ordering
of the pattern appears to occur in two stages, characterized by an initial rapid
annihilation of defect pairs and a later much slower phase. In the longitudinal

case the defect number decreases in large steps, which are associated with the
annihilation of a string of defects roughly aligned with the rolls, whereas no
such steps are visible in the transverse case. The overall decay is substantially
slower for the pattern induced by the transverse instability. This had also been
found in the absence of mean ﬂow [29].

Snapshots of the reconstructed patterns at the ﬁnal time t = 1750 are shown in
ﬁg.12. Only a quarter of the whole system is shown. While in the longitudinal
the defect density case is very low and the defects are essentially isolated
from each other, in the transverse case most of the defects are part of grain
boundaries.

To quantify the evolution of the amount of disorder in the orientation of the
hexagons we determine the orientation of the local wavevector qj relative to
the roll direction ˆnj as deﬁned by the angle αj:

In ﬁgure 13 we plot the probability distribution function (PDF) of the orien-
tation angle α1 as a function of time for the cases shown in ﬁgures 10 and 11.
Again, time t = 0 is where the ﬁrst dislocation occurs, and we have truncated
the large peaks (around α1 = 0) at early times so that more structures can be
discerned at later times. Similar PDFs are found for the other two amplitudes
as well. For the longitudinal mode the PDF is centered around α1 = 0 from
the beginning to the end, with the peak broadening around t = 0 when the
ﬁrst few defects appear. Thus, for all times there is only a single domain and
the hexagons remain essentially aligned with their initial orientation. In the
transverse case, however, the initial peak at α1 = 0 quickly decays and gives

way to two peaks of comparable size. This occurs around the time when the
maximum number of defects is reached. The bi-modal PDF indicates that the
transverse mode predominantly induces hexagons of two diﬀerent orientations,
which then co-exist for a long time.

Hexagons vs. Rolls.

In the absence of mean ﬂow, the competition between uniform hexagons
and rolls is governed by the energy diﬀerence between them. For a given q,
hexagons are more stable than rolls for µ lower than a threshold value µth(q),
at which the rolls and hexagons have the same free energy [29], while rolls are
energetically favored above µth. This boundary is indicated by the dashed line
in ﬁgure 3. Below the dashed line, outside the stability balloon, the unsta-
ble transverse and longitudinal modes grow and evolve towards a hexagon of
diﬀerent wavenumber. Above this line, rolls appear during the transients and
eventually replace the hexagon.

Due to the lack of a Lyapunov functional for eqs.(4,5), we resort to numerical
simulations to locate the boundary between hexagon and roll in the presence
0.6 for diﬀerent values of β. For

example, for β =
0.1 (Prandtl number = 10) and q = 0.6 we ﬁnd rolls as
the ﬁnal state at µ = 1.45 (ﬁgure 14(a)) while a mixed state of rolls and
hexagons is found at µ = 1.425 (ﬁgure 14(b)). Thus, the transition value in µ
0.1 is between 1.425 and 1.45. The enhanced instability
at q = 0.6 for β =
of the transverse mode for q = 0.6 leads apparently to an earlier transition to
rolls when the Prandtl number is decreased. At this point it is not clear why

In this section we study the eﬀect of the mean ﬂow on the motion of a penta-
hepta defect (PHD), which is a bound state of two dislocations in two of the
three amplitudes. For large Prandtl number, where the mean ﬂow is negligible,
there exists a semi-closed form solution for stationary penta-hepta defects for
hexagons at the band-center (q = 0) [33]. We study the general case with mean
ﬂow numerically by embedding two PHDs in the system as initial conditions
and measure their velocity as a function of β and q for ﬁxed µ = 1 and ν = 2.

j , where δ1(2)
N
is the charge of the ﬁrst (second) PHD in the
jth amplitude [33]. In our simulations N =
2 and the PHDs attract each
other. Their interaction decreases with distance and we ﬁnd that it becomes
negligible for distances larger than 300 (for β = 0 and q = 0 the interaction-
induced velocity is then below v = 0.001). Thus in the following, we place the
two PHDs at least at a distance of 300 apart in the initial conﬁguration for
the velocity measurement of individual PHD.

In the absence of mean ﬂow, each independent PHD is found to move at a
constant velocity, which vanishes at q = 0 [32,33]. In the presence of mean
ﬂow, we also ﬁnd that isolated defects move at a constant velocity. It is shown
in ﬁgure 15 as a function of β for q = 0. The range of the linear scaling with
respect to the coupling strength indicates that, for small β, the contribution
of the mean ﬂow to the PHD velocity is purely additive via the advective

deviates signiﬁcantly from the linear scaling. This is analogous to the eﬀect
of mean ﬂow on dislocations in roll pattern [50]. Also, for larger
the mean
ﬂow structure becomes distorted near the defect as shown in ﬁgure 16. The
mean ﬂow consists of two pairs of vortices, and is almost zero away from the
defect. While for β =
0.2 (left panel) the two vortex pairs are of comparable
strength, the pair on the right is much stronger than that on the left when β is
1.4 (right panel) This change occurs smoothly in β. When
decreased to β =
the Prandtl number is decreased further so that β is below

limit comes very close to the background wavenumber q = 0 of the pattern

the wavenumber of the ﬁnal state is in general not the critical wavenumber

With and without mean ﬂow, the orientation of the initial and of the ﬁnal

hexagons starting from random initial conditions the orientation of a hexagon
pattern within a given domain may rotate in a similar fashion and in the
long-time dynamics the orientation of adjacent domains may predominantly
be close to the stationarity condition for PHD’s, i.e. the projections of their
wavevectors onto a suitably chosen ˆn have the same value and that value is
close to qst. Of course, since our results are based on Ginzburg-Landau equa-
tions they only apply to grain boundaries across which the orientation changes
only by small amounts. Furthermore, in the truncation (4,5) the higher-order
ˆτi have been neglected. They are expected to mod-
transverse derivatives
ify the stationarity condition, since the defect velocity will also depend on the
ˆτi. The independence of the veloc-
transverse component of the wavevector, ~qi ·
ity on the transverse component within (4,5) is related to the isotropy of the

6 Conclusion

The importance of mean ﬂows has been noted in a wide range of pattern-
forming systems. Various diﬀerent types can be distinguished. In systems like
binary-mixture convection [51] and in surface waves on liquids with small
viscosity [52] they are driven by traveling waves. In other systems they corre-
spond to a Goldstone mode as is the case in free-slip convection (e.g. [40,53]) or
they arise from a conservation law, e.g. in systems with a deformable interface
[54,55]. Then they constitute a separate dynamical variable and satisfy an evo-
lution equation of their own. Depending on the symmetries of the system, the
additional degree of freedom can introduce a host of new phenomena (e.g. [56–
58]). In this paper we have studied the mean ﬂow that is driven in Rayleigh-
B´enard convection by deformations of the convection pattern, which becomes
relevant even close to onset for ﬂuids with low Prandtl number [5,39,40]. In
the realistic case of no-slip boundary conditions it does not constitute an addi-
tional dynamical variable. Due to the incompressibility of the ﬂuid it can only
arise in three-dimensional systems, i.e. in two-dimensionally extended pat-
terns, and introduces then a non-local interaction. Experimentally, its most
striking signatures are the skew-varicose instability and the appearance of spi-
ral defect chaos. The experimental observation of the skew-varicose instability
and of transients of spiral-defect chaos in standing waves in vertically vibrated

27

granular media [22,23] suggests that a similar mean ﬂow may also be relevant
in that system.

The focus of our weakly nonlinear analysis has been the impact of the mean
ﬂow on the stability and dynamics of hexagonal patterns. We have extended
the usual three coupled Ginzburg-Landau equations for the description of
hexagonal patterns by an equation for a vertical-vorticity mode in direct ex-
tension of previous work on roll convection at small Prandtl numbers [39,40].

In general, there are two side-band instabilities that limit the band of sta-
ble wavenumbers of hexagons. In the absence of mean ﬂow it is always the
longitudinal long-wave mode that is the relevant destabilizing mode imme-
diately above the saddle-node bifurcation at which the hexagons come ﬁrst
into existence, while the transverse long-wave mode is the relevant mode for
larger amplitudes. The Rayleigh number for the cross-over from one to the
other mode depends on the cross-coupling coeﬃcient ν, but for realistic value
it always occurs very close to the saddle-node bifurcation. The longitudinal
mode is therefore poorly accessible in the absence of mean ﬂow (e.g. [29]). We
found that in the long-wave limit only one of the two phase modes, the trans-
verse mode, couples to the mean ﬂow and consequently only its stability limit
depends on the Prandtl number. Speciﬁcally, for suﬃciently small Prandtl
2.6 for ν = 2) the transverse mode is stabilized for wavenumbers
numbers (
below the critical wavenumber to the extent that it is preempted by the longi-
tudinal mode over the whole range of Rayleigh numbers from the saddle-node
bifurcation to the transition to the mixed mode. In this regime studies of the
diﬀerence between the two modes should be accessible in experiments since
the type of instability encountered depends on whether the stability limits are
crossed at the low- or the high-q side of the stability balloon.

∼

Our simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the instabilities indicate that,
compared to the longitudinal instability, the transverse instability leads to a
considerably larger number of penta-hepta defects and to more grain bound-
aries separating patches of hexagons that are rotated with respect to each
other. While indications of this were also found in the absence of the mean
ﬂow [29], the mean ﬂow makes the distinction clear enough to make it worth
addressing experimentally. To do so, hexagon patterns with a wavenumber
away from the band center need to be initiated. Recently it has been shown
that such initial conditions can, in fact, be prepared by a suitable localized
heating of the ﬂuid [37,50]. Given the striking diﬀerence in the transients aris-
ing from the instabilities of the two modes it would be interesting to bring
these techniques to bear in this system.

Although the coupling to the mean ﬂow makes the system non-variational no
regime has been identiﬁed in which oscillatory instabilities are relevant. We
also ﬁnd that the stability limits are always determined by long-wave instabil-

28

ities and no additional instabilities at ﬁnite wavenumbers arise. Furthermore,
to the order considered, the coupling to the mean ﬂow vanishes at the band
center. This implies that the pattern is always linearly stable there.

As is the case in roll convection, the mean ﬂow also aﬀects the motion of de-
fects. For the penta-hepta defects relevant in hexagonal patterns we ﬁnd that
similar to the case of rolls the wavenumber at which the defect is stationary
is shifted to wavenumbers smaller than the critical one. For coarsening ex-
periments starting from random initial conditions one may therefore expect
that the eventual wavenumber of the ordered pattern may be reduced corre-
spondingly. Our simulation suggest that the dependence of the defect velocity
on the wave vector allows one to predict which grain boundaries have a par-
ticularly long life time. Furthermore, a persistent drift of the defects in the
grain boundary is also observed in the simulations. One may also expect that
similar to the case of dislocations in roll patterns [38] the mean ﬂow may allow
two penta-hepta defects to form stable pairs if the background wavenumber is
between the critical wavenumber and that corresponding to stationary defects.

A Derivation of the nonlinear phase equations

Here we derive the nonlinear phase equations at the codimension-two point
(q(ct), R(ct)) where both σt and σl are zero. Mainly, to obtain explicit expres-
sions for (q(ct), R(ct)) we consider weak mean ﬂow, β
1. (cf. eq.(30)). We
rescale X = δx, Y = δy, and T = δ4t. In this expansion δ and β are two inde-
pendent small parameters. Here we expand the amplitudes Aj = rjeiqˆnj·(x,y)+iφj
as

We substitute the above expansions into eqs.(4,5) and solve them at successive
orders for δ. The mean ﬂow feeds back to the equations for the phases φj via
the amplitude modulations (cf. eq.(5)). Thus, at each order we ﬁrst solve for
the amplitudes and the mean ﬂow in terms of the phases that were determined
at the previous orders, and substitute these solutions into the phase equations
to obtain the phases at the next order. At

At cubic order we recover eq.(24). In order to go on to ﬁfth order we require
that both σl and σt vanish (up to second order in β). As in section 3, the

and φy = (φ20 −

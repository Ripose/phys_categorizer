Equations relating structure functions of all orders

Reginald J. Hill

(October 14, 2013)

The hierarchy of exact equations are given that relate two-spatial-point velocity structure func-
tions of arbitrary order with other statistics. Because no assumption is used, the exact statistical
equations can apply to any ﬂow for which the Navier-Stokes equations are accurate and no mat-
ter how small the number of samples in the ensemble. The exact statistical equations can be
used to verify DNS computations and to detect their limitations because if DNS data are used
to evaluate the exact statistical equations, then the equations should balance to within numerical
precision, otherwise a computational problem is indicated. The equations allow quantiﬁcation of
the approach to local homogeneity and to local isotropy. Testing the balance of the equations
allows detection of scaling ranges for quantiﬁcation of inertial-range exponents. The second-order
equations lead to Kolmogorov’s equation. All higher-order equations contain a statistic composed
of one factor of the two-point diﬀerence of the pressure gradient multiplied by factors of velocity
diﬀerence.
Investigation of this pressure-gradient-diﬀerence statistic can reveal much about two
issues: 1) whether or not diﬀerent components of the velocity structure function of given order
have diﬀering exponents in the inertial range, and 2) the increasing deviation of those exponents
from Kolmogorov scaling as the order increases. Full disclosure of the mathematical methods is in
xxx.lanl.gov/list/physics.ﬂu-dyn/0102055.

I. INTRODUCTION

Kolmogorov’s (1941) equation and Yaglom’s equation were the ﬁrst two equations of the “dynamic theory”
of the local structure of turbulence. The name “dynamic theory” was originated by Monin & Yaglom (1975) (their
Sec. 22) to mean the derivation of equations relating structure functions by use of the Navier-Stokes equation and/or
the scalar conservation equation, and the investigation of the resulting statistical equations. Monin & Yaglom
(1975) pointed out that the dynamic theory gives important relationships among structure functions, and that these
relationships provide extensions of predictions based on dimensional analysis. Theoretical studies (Lindborg 1996;
Hill 1997a) clariﬁed the assumptions that are the basis of Kolmogorov’s equation and give equations that are valid
for anisotropic and locally homogeneous turbulence as well as for the case of local isotropy and local homogeneity.
Antonia et al. (1983) and Chambers & Antonia (1984) used experimental data to study of the balance of the classic
equations of Kolmogorov and Yaglom. There is renewed interest in examining the balance of those equations using
both experimental and DNS data and in generalizing the equations to cases of inhomogeneous, nonstationary, and
anisotropic turbulence (Lindborg 1999; Danaila et al., 1999a,b,c; Antonia et al. 2000). Whereas Kolmogorov’s
(1941) equation relates 2nd- and 3rd-order velocity structure functions, the next-order dynamic equation relates 3rd-
and 4th-order structure functions and a pressure-gradient, velocity-velocity structure function. The balance of that
next-order equation has been examined by means of experimental and DNS data; this showed the behavior of the
pressure-gradient, velocity-velocity structure function (Hill & Boratav 2001). There is now interest in dynamic-theory
equations of arbitrarily high order N (Yakhot 2001). Such equations relate velocity structure functions of order N
and N + 1 and other statistics. Those equations are given in this paper.

Using the assumptions of local homogeneity, local isotropy and the Navier-Stokes equation, Yakhot (2001)
derived the equation for the characteristic function of the probability distribution of two-point velocity diﬀerences.
He uses that equation to derive higher-order dynamic equations. Equations for arbitrarily high-order structure
functions can be obtained by repeated application of his diﬀerentiation procedure. Yakhot (2001) studies the inertial-
range, deduces a closure, and thereby determines the inertial-range scaling exponents of velocity structure functions.
Yakhot’s study is the ﬁrst to make signiﬁcant use of dynamic-theory equations to determine scaling exponents.

The purposes and theoretical method of the present paper diﬀer from those of Yakhot (2001), but one purpose
is to verify Yakhot’s equations from our distinctly diﬀerent derivation. That veriﬁcation is given in Sec. 5.
In
Sec. 2, exact statistical equations relating velocity structure functions of any order are derived from the Navier-
Stokes equation. “Exact” means that no assumptions are made other than the assumption that the Navier-Stokes
equation and incompressibility are accurate. Since the equations are exact, they apply to any ﬂow, including laminar
ﬂow and inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulent ﬂow. The exact statistical equations can be used to verify DNS

1

computations and detect their limitations. New experimental methods of Dahm and colleagues (Su & Dahm 1996)
can also be tested. For example, if DNS data are used to evaluate the exact statistical equations, then the equations
In Sec. 3, statistical
should balance to within numerical precision, otherwise a computational problem is indicated.
equations valid for locally homogeneous and anisotropic turbulence are obtained from the exact equations; those
equations can be used with DNS or experimental (Su & Dahm 1996) data to study the approach to local homogeneity
of a particular ﬂow. This can be done by quantifying the terms that are neglected when passing from exact equations
to the locally homogeneous case, and by quantifying changes in the retained terms as local homogeneity is approached
when the spatial separation vector is decreased.
In Sec. 4, statistical equations valid for locally isotropic and locally
homogeneous turbulence are obtained from those for the locally homogeneous case. The approach to local isotropy
can be studied by means analogous to the above described evaluation of local homogeneity.
Such studies might
shed light on the observed persistence of anisotropy (Pumir & Shraiman 1995; Shen & Warhaft 2000). All dynamic-
theory equations are now available to extend the above-mentioned previous studies of the balance of dynamic-theory
equations.

Incompressibility requires that the diﬀerent components of the second-order velocity structure function have
the same scaling exponent in the inertial range. The same is true for the third-order structure function. However,
at fourth and higher order there is no such requirement. There have been many studies of the possibility that the
inertial-range scaling exponents of the various structure-function components are unequal (e.g., Chen et al. 1997;
Boratav & Pelz 1997; Boratav 1997; Grossmann et al. 1997; van de Water & Herweijer 1999; Camussi & Benzi 1997;
Dhruva et al. 1997; Antonia et al. 1998; Kahaleras et al. 1996; Noullez et al. 1997; Nelkin 1999; Zhou & Antonia
2000; Kerr et al. 2001). The usefulness of applying the higher-order dynamic-theory equations to those investigations
is considered in Sec. 6.

Derivation of the equations produces substantial mathematical detail. Matrix-based algorithms are invented
such that the isotropic formulas for the divergence and Laplacian of isotropic tensors of any order can be generated
by computer. The details of this mathematics are available and are herein referred to as the Archive.1

II. EXACT TWO-POINT EQUATIONS

The Navier-Stokes equation for velocity component ui(x, t) is

∂tui(x, t) + un(x, t)∂xn ui(x, t) = −∂xip(x, t) + ν∂xn∂xn ui(x, t),

and the incompressibility condition is ∂xnun(x, t) = 0.
In (1), p(x, t) is the pressure divided by the density (density
is constant), ν is kinematic viscosity, and ∂ denotes partial diﬀerentiation with respect to its subscript variable.
Summation is implied by repeated Roman indices. Consider another point x′ such that x′ and x are independent
variables. For brevity, let ui = ui(x, t), u′
i = ui(x′, t), etc. Require that x and x′ have no relative motion. Then
uj = 0, etc., and ∂t is performed with both x and x′ ﬁxed. The change of independent variables from
∂xiu′
x and x′ to the sum and diﬀerence independent variables is:

The change of variables organizes the equations in a revealing way because of the following properties.
homogeneous turbulence, ∂Xi operating on a statistic produces zero because that derivative is the rate of change with
respect to the place where the measurement is performed. Consider a term in an equation composed of ∂Xi operating
on a statistic. For locally homogeneous turbulence, that term becomes negligible as r is decreased relative to the
integral scale. For the homogeneous and locally homogeneous cases, the statistical equations retain their dependence
on r, which is the displacement vector of two points of measurement. Subtracting (1) at x′ from (1) at x, performing
the change of variables (2), and using (3) gives

Now multiply (4) by the product vj vk · · · vl which contains N − 1 factors of velocity diﬀerence, each factor
having a distinct index. Sum the N equations as required to produce symmetry under interchange of each pair of
indices, excluding the summation index n. French braces, i.e., {◦}, denote the sum of all terms of a given type that
produce symmetry under interchange of each pair of indices. The diﬀerentiation chain rule gives

{vj vk · · · vl∂tvi} = ∂t (vjvk · · · vlvi) ,

{vj vk · · · vlUn∂Xn vi} = Un∂Xn (vjvk · · · vlvi) = ∂Xn (Unvj vk · · · vlvi) ,
{vjvk · · · vlvn∂rn vi} = vn∂rn (vjvk · · · vlvi) = ∂rn (vnvjvk · · · vlvi) .

The right-most expressions in (7) and (8) follow from the incompressibility property obtained from (3) and the fact
that ∂xiu′

A. Hierarchy of exact statistical equations

Consider the ensemble average because it commutes with temporal and spatial derivatives. The above notation
of explicit indices is burdensome. Because the tensors are symmetric, it suﬃces to show only the number of indices.
Deﬁne the following statistical tensors which are symmetric under interchange of any pair of indices, excluding the
summation index n in the deﬁnition of F[N +1]:

D[N ] ≡ hvj · · · vii , F[N +1] ≡ hUnvj · · · vii , T[N ] ≡ h{vj · · · vlPi}i , E[N ] ≡ h{vk · · · vleij}i ,

(12)

where angle brackets hi denote the ensemble average, and the subscripts N and N + 1 within square brackets denote
the number of indices. The left-hand side of each deﬁnition in (12) is in implicit-index notation for which only the
number of indices is given; the right-hand sides in (12) are in explicit-index notation. The argument list for each
tensor is understood to be (X, r, t). The ensemble average of (9) is

III. HOMOGENEOUS AND LOCALLY HOMOGENEOUS TURBULENCE

Consider homogeneous turbulence and locally homogeneous turbulence; the latter applies for small r and large
Reynolds number. The variation of the statistics with the location of measurement or of evaluation is zero for the
homogeneous case and is neglected for the locally homogeneous case. Since that location is X, the result of ∇X

that ∂tD[N ]
h{∂Xi [vjvk · · · vl (p − p′)]}i = {∂Xi hvjvk · · · vl (p − p′)i} = {0} = 0. Thus, (11) gives the alternative that

One distinction between (14) and the hierarchy equations given in equations (13) and (17) by Arad et al. (1999) is
that their t- and r-derivatives operate on only one velocity diﬀerence within their product of such diﬀerences, whereas
the derivatives in (9) and thus in (14) operate on all N of the velocity diﬀerences.

IV. ISOTROPIC AND LOCALLY ISOTROPIC TURBULENCE

Consider isotropic turbulence and locally isotropic turbulence; the latter applies for small r and large Reynolds
number. Locally isotropic ﬂows are a subset of locally homogeneous ﬂows (Monin & Yaglom Sec. 13.3, 1975) and
similarly for the relationship between isotropic and homogeneous ﬂows. Thus, the dynamical equations for locally
isotropic and isotropic turbulence are obtained from (14) such that the variable X and the terms ∇X • F[N +1] and
1
4 ∇2
XD[N ] (see 13) do not appear. The tensors D[N ], T[N ], and E[N ] in (12) obey the isotropic formula. The
Kronecker delta δij is deﬁned by δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i 6= j. Let δ[2P ] denote the product of P Kronecker
deltas having 2P distinct indices, and let W[N ] (r) denote the product of N factors ri
r each with a distinct index;
the argument r is omitted when clarity does not suﬀer. Because each tensor in (12) is symmetric under interchange
of any two indices, their isotropic formulas are particularly simple. Each formula is a sum of M + 1 terms where
M = N/2 if N is even, and M = (N − 1) /2 if N is odd. Each term is the product of a distinct scalar function with
a W[N ] and a δ[2P ]. From one term to the next a pair of indices is transferred from a W[N ] to a δ[2P ]; examples are
in the Archive. For the tensor D[N ], denote the P th scalar function by DN,P (r, t). The isotropic formula for D[N ] is

D[N ] (r, t) =

DN,P (r, t)

W[N −2P ] (r) δ[2P ]

,

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

XP =0

and the isotropic formulas for T[N ] and E[N ] have the analogous notation. Recall from Sec. 2 the meaning of the
W[N −2P ] (r) δ[2P ]
denotes the sum of all terms of the type W[N −2P ] (r) δ[2P ] that produce
notation {◦} whereby

(cid:8)

A special Cartesian coordinate system simpliﬁes the isotropic formulas. This coordinate system has the positive
1-axis parallel to the direction of r, and the 2- and 3-axes are therefore perpendicular to r. Let N1, N2, and N3 be the
number of indices of a component of D[N ] that are 1, 2, and 3, respectively; such that N = N1 + N2 + N3. Because of
symmetry, the order of indices is immaterial so that a component of D[N ] can be identiﬁed by N1, N2, and N3. Thus,
denote a component of D[N ] by D[N1,N2,N3] which is a function of r and t. Likewise,
[N1,N2,N3] is a

By applying (16-18) for all combinations of indices, one can determine which components D[N1,N2,N3] are zero
and which are nonzero, identify M + 1 linearly independent equations that determine the DN,P in terms of M + 1 of

the D[N1,N2,N3], and ﬁnd algebraic relationships between the remaining nonzero D[N1,N2,N3]. The derivations are in
the Archive; a summary follows.

A component D[N1,N2,N3] is nonzero only if both N2 and N3 are even, and therefore N1 is odd if N is odd, and
N1 is even if N is even. Thereby, (M + 1) (M + 2) /2 components are nonzero. There are 3N components of D[N ];
thus the other 3N − (M + 1) (M + 2) /2 components are zero.

There exist (M + 1) M/2 kinematic relationships among the nonzero components of D[N ]. For each of the

M + 1 cases of N1, these relationships are expressed by the proportionality

D[N1,2L,0] : D[N1,2L−2,2] : D[N1,2L−4,4] : · · · : D[N1,0,2L] =

[(2L)!0!/L!0!] : [(2L − 2)!2!/ (L − 1)!1!] : [(2L − 4)!4!/ (L − 2)!2!] : · · · : [0! (2L)!/0!L!] .

(19)

For N = 4 with L = 2, (19) gives D[0,4,0] : D[0,2,2] : D[0,0,4] = 12 : 4 : 12. In explicit-index notation this can be written
as D2222 = 3D2233 = D3333, which was discovered by Millionshtchikov (1941) and is the only previously known such
relationship. Now, all such relationships are known from (19).

There remain M + 1 linearly independent nonzero components of D[N ]. This must be so because there are
M + 1 terms in (16) and the M + 1 scalar functions DN,P therein must be related to M + 1 components. Consider
the M + 1 linearly independent equations that determine the DN,P in terms of M + 1 of the D[N1,N2,N3]. For
simplicity, the chosen components can all have N3 = 0; i.e., the choice of linearly independent components can be
D[N,0,0], D[N −2,2,0], D[N −4,4,0], · · ·, D[N −2M,2M,0]. As described above, assigning index values in (16) results in the
chosen components on the left-hand side and algebraic expressions on the right-hand side that contain the coeﬃcients
(17-18). In the Archive, those equations are expressed in matrix form and solved by matrix inversion methods. Given
experimental or DNS data or a theoretical formula for the chosen components, the solution of the algebraic equations
determines the functions DN,P in (16); then (16) completely speciﬁes the tensor D[N ].

The matrix algorithm in the Archive is an eﬃcient means of determining isotropic expressions for the terms

∇r • D[N +1] and ∇2

rD[N ] in (14). From the example for N = 2 in the Archive, (14) gives the two scalar equations

Thus, it suﬃces to give the isotropic formulas for the divergence ∇r • D[N +1] and Laplacian ∇2
rD[N ]; for N = 4 to 7,
those isotropic formulas are given in Table 1. For N = 4 and 5 there are M + 1 = 3 equations; there are M + 1 = 4
equations for both N = 6 and 7.

VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The third paragraph of the introduction summarizes part of this paper and is not repeated here.

In addition:
All of the kinematic relationships (19) between components of isotropic, symmetric structure functions of arbitrary
order have been identiﬁed, whereas previously only one was known. All of the components that are zero have been
identiﬁed (a recent experimental evaluation of some of them is given by Kurien & Sreenivasan 2000). The kinematic
relationships show that the scaling exponents of certain diﬀerent components must be equal; if the exponents are not
equal when evaluated using one’s data, then the kinematic relationships (19) provide a measure of either the error
in the exponents or the deviation from local isotropy. The dynamic equations of order N can be used to test the

6

extent of a scaling range for evaluation of scaling exponents of velocity structure functions of order N + 1 because the
time-derivative and viscous terms should be zero in an inertial range. The graphical presentations of the balance of
Kolmogorov’s equation by Antonia et al. (1983), Chambers & Antonia (1984), Danaila et al. (1999a,b), and Antonia
et al. (2000) show the extent of, or deviation from, inertial-range exponents. The higher-order equations given here
can be used in an analogous manner.

The energy dissipation rate ε plays an essential role at all r in Kolmogorov’s equation.

In our formulation ε
arises in (20-21) from the tensor components 2νE11 and 2νE22. On the other hand, for the next-order equations (22-
23) Hill (1997b) showed that the corresponding terms 2νE111 and 2νE122 are negligible in the inertial range. Yakhot
(2001) shows that the components E[N,0,0] are negligible in the inertial range for all of the higher-order equations for
which N is odd. Kolmogorov’s (1941) inertial-range scaling using ε and r as the only relevant parameters can be
used to estimate the relative magnitudes of the term ∇r • D[N +1] in (14) to the terms 2ν∇2
rD[N ] and 2νE[N ]. Doing
so, the ratio of any nonzero component of 2ν∇2
rD[N ] or 2νE[N ] to the corresponding component of ∇r • D[N +1] is
proportional to ν/r4/3ε1/3 = (r/η)
). Thus,
both terms 2ν∇2

−4/3, which asymptotically vanishes in the inertial range (η ≡

rD[N ] and 2νE[N ] are to be neglected in an inertial range if N > 2.

One concludes that all equations of order higher than Kolmogorov’s equation reduce to the isotropic formula
for ∇r • D[N +1] = −T[N ] in the inertial range. This formula shows that T[N ] is at the heart of two issues that
have received much attention: 1) whether or not diﬀerent components of the velocity structure function D[N +1] have
diﬀering exponents in the inertial range, and 2) the increasing deviation of those exponents from Kolmogorov scaling
as N increases. The physical basis for the importance of T[N ] is the importance of vortex tubes to the intermittency
phenomenon (Pullin & Saﬀman 1998) combined with the fact that the pressure-gradient force is essential to the
existence of vortex tubes; the pressure-gradient force prevents a vortex tube from cavitating despite the centrifugal
force. Pressure gradients are the sinews of vortex tubes. Direct investigation of T[N ] using DNS can reveal much
about the two issues.

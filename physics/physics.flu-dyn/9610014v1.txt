Uniqueness in Relativistic Hydrodynamics

(February 2, 2008)

The choice of the 4-velocity in the relativistic hydrodynamics proposed by Landau and Lifshitz
is demonstrated to be the only one satisfying all general principles. Especially the far more widely
adopted Eckart choice has to be abandoned.

ITP-UH-11/96

Three reasons come to mind for seeking a covariant
formulation of the hydrodynamic theory for simple ﬂu-
ids: In a fundamental vein, we want hydrodynamics as a
basic theory to be covariant; in fact, this was one of the
ﬁrst few tasks tackled after the birth of special relativity.
More practically, relativistic hydrodynamics is increas-
ingly employed in cosmology and astrophysics to study
dissipative processes, such as the relaxation of inhomo-
geneities in the early universe, or its viscosity-driven, in-
ﬂationary expansion [1]. Finally, any residual ambiguities
in the relativistic hydrodynamics are an indication of our
less-than-perfect grasp also of the Galilean version. They
require close scrutiny.

Covariant hydrodynamics can be found in most text-
books on relativity and astrophysics. Better ones give
two versions, one due to Eckart [2,3], the other by Lan-
dau and Lifshitz (LL) [4]. While Eckart pins the macro-
scopic 4-velocity uµ to the total particle current, LL set it
proportional to the total energy ﬂux. So there is no dis-
sipative particle current in the Eckart version, in direct
analogy to the non-relativistic case; while LL — at ﬁrst
sight somewhat odd — do have one, and they refrain from
a dissipative energy current instead. In the literature, the
Eckart version is much more widely employed [1,3,5], it
seems the more traditional theory. Yet, both reduce to
the familiar non-relativistic hydrodynamics for c → ∞;
besides, standard textbooks (eg. Weinberg [3]) regard
the two versions as equivalent, as being related by a sim-
ple transformation of the velocity. Clearly, one need not
worry about a mere diﬀerence in the reference frame.

This equivalence, however, is a fallacy. Let us recall
how the velocity is deﬁned in hydrodynamic theories,
consider ﬁrst the non-relativistic case. The standard
Gibbs relation, valid not only when equilibrium reigns,
takes the entropy density s as a function of ﬁve conserved
densities, energy ǫ, momentum g, and mass ̺,

T ds = dǫ − v·dg − µ d̺ .

(1)

It states unequivocally that the velocity is a thermody-
namic quantity, v ≡ −T (∂s/∂g), known if the local en-
tropy density is.
It contains only equilibrium informa-
tion. This is of course the concept of local equilibrium,
one of the few founding principles of the hydrodynamic

1

theory: It takes far less time to establish equilibrium lo-
cally than globally; the ﬁrst is a microscopic time τ (re-
ferred to as the collision time in dilute systems), the other
grows with the system dimension and is macroscopic. As
long as the frequency is small enough, ωτ ≪ 1, the Gibbs
relation holds, and all thermodynamic variables ǫ, g, ̺,
and their conjugate variables T , v, µ contain only in-
formation about the local equilibrium state. Especially,
they possess a well deﬁned parity under time reversal.
The relativistic description is hardly diﬀerent: The ve-
locity v becomes the 4-velocity, uµ ≡ −T (∂sν/∂T µν),
with sµ and T µν being the equilibrium entropy 4-vector
and energy-momentum tensor, respectively. So uµ too
contains only equilibrium information.

Now, the diﬀerence between the two 4-velocities men-
tioned above is clearly in dissipative quantities, so at
least one contains non-equilibrium information and can-
not be the correct hydrodynamic velocity. This argument
agrees with the prima facie evidence that the two ver-
sions of relativistic hydrodynamics have diﬀerent types
of diﬀerential equations. For example, the equation for
the transverse velocity is elliptic in the Eckart version,
and parabolic in that of LL. (In the so-called extended
thermodynamic theories — cf. discussion below — the
equation can be rendered hyperbolic for either choice of
the 4-velocity. Still, as these are extensions of diﬀerent
hydrodynamic theories, they remain distinctly diﬀerent.)
Having clariﬁed that both versions are inequivalent, we
obviously need to address the question: Which, if any, is
the correct theory for relativistic dissipative ﬂuids? In
seeking uniqueness in a relativistic theory — since the
c → ∞ limit proves inconclusive — it is natural to ex-
amine how uniqueness is achieved in the Galilean ver-
sion. Unfortunately, this is something of a red herring,
as the lack of a dissipative particle current in the Galilean
hydrodynamics, or j = ̺ v, is more a statement of mi-
croscopic plausibility, and maybe the bold summary of
countless experiments; it is not the result of a cogent and
general deduction. In fact, a classic paper by Dzyaloshin-
skii and Volovik [6] proposes to include the dissipative
term j − ̺ v ∼ ∇µ.

Nevertheless, a footnote by LL, in §49 of [4], states
that the mass current j should always be equal to the

momentum density g = ̺ v, and therefore cannot pos-
sess any dissipative terms. Their line of argument, re-
grettably, falls short of being ironclad: Starting from the
continuity equation and the center-of-mass motion, they
assert the validity of R dV g = R dV j, where the integra-
tion volume is that of the total system. The reader is left
wondering especially about the alleged equivalence to the
local relation g = j.

In this paper, we shall ameliorate both aspects. We
provide a clear cut proof of g = j, demonstrating the
rigorous validity of the standard form of the Galilean
hydrodynamics; and we demonstrate that only the LL
version of the relativistic hydrodynamic theory conforms
to all general principles. The proof g = j takes place in
very much the same way as deducing the symmetry of
the momentum ﬂux, or stress tensor, from local angular
momentum conservation. The relevant conserved den-
sity here is i ≡ ̺ x − g t, with x and t denoting the space
and time coordinates, respectively. While i is known to
be additive, conserved, and the direct consequence of the
invariance under Galilean boosts [7], it has not been hith-
erto included in thermodynamic and hydrodynamic con-
siderations. As will become clear soon, this is a serious
omission. Its inclusion not only establishes the form of
the mass ﬂux, but also leads to general thermodynamic
equilibrium conditions that are valid for any reference
frame. Surprisingly, these simple yet fairly fundamental
relations are new.

Relativistically, the information of g = j is automati-
cally included in the symmetry of the energy-momentum
tensor, though j is now the inertial mass current, ie. the
total energy ﬂux including the rest mass. Since the mo-
mentum density remains a thermodynamic variable, with
a negative parity under time inversion, neither the mo-
mentum density nor the inertial mass current may con-
tain any dissipative terms (in the local rest-frame). This
excludes any covariant theory that does not adopt the
LL 4-velocity.

Two pieces of information were needed in each of the
(i) The equality of the momentum den-
above cases:
sity to the (rest or inertial) mass current; (ii) the fact
that the momentum density is a thermodynamic vari-
able with a well deﬁned parity. It is ironic that while the
condensed matter people were wondering about the ﬁrst
piece, which for the relativists is a trivial consequence of
the 4-notation, the latter ignored the second, something
the former group never does. We physicists are indeed
a community divided by notations. Piercing both pieces
together, the kinship to be expected between the two ver-
sions of hydrodynamics becomes evident. For instance,
repeating the relativistic mistake in the non-relativistic
theory, ie. violating the second condition while upholding
the ﬁrst, leads to, as will become clear soon,

g = j = ̺ v − χ (∇µ + ∂tv).

(2)

This is in striking similarity to the momentum density in

the Eckart theory, the dissipative part of which has the
form τ i4 = −χ (T −1∂iT + ∂tui) [3]. Yet Eq. (2) is man-
ifestly unphysical: The total and conserved momentum
must remain R d3x ̺v, irrespective whether the system is
in equilibrium or not, or what its acceleration is.

Of the three issues plaguing the relativistic hydrody-
namics — uniqueness, causality and stability — we focus
on the ﬁrst. But we need to comment on the other two,
as they have been the starting points of worthwhile ef-
forts in the past that partially tie in with our results.
First, causality. Strictly speaking, the diﬀusion equation
implies signals with inﬁnite velocity, or horizontal “world
lines”. While unphysical generally, this defect is aggra-
vated in relativity: When viewed from a diﬀerent frame,
the world lines tilt, implying signals that go backwards
in time. To repair this, extended thermodynamic theo-
ries [5,8] were put forward which start from the hydrody-
namic theories but include additional dynamic variables.
The resultant larger set of coeﬃcients can be chosen such
that all the diﬀerential equations are hyperbolic, ensur-
ing causality. The price for this nice feature is a rather
more complicated theory, and the diﬃculty of ﬁnding a
universally valid and accepted set of additional variables
— except perhaps in dilute systems.

But we may also take a more perspective view, and
accept that the diﬀusion equation is not an exact math-
ematical statement. Rather, it is an approximative de-
scription — conﬁned to the hydrodynamic regime, with
an accuracy of the order of thermal ﬂuctuations. Tak-
ing this into account, (eg. considering only amplitudes
of the variables that are above a minimal threshold,) the
signal velocity never exceeds that of the constituent par-
ticles [9], excluding any acausal consequences.

Next, stability, ﬁrst in the ﬂuid’s rest frame: The LL
theory is stable with respect to small ﬂuctuations around
an equilibrium conﬁguration, not so the Eckart version
[10], and remarkably, nor the non-relativistic theory that
contains Eq. (2). In fact, both suﬀer from the same prob-
lem. Consider a small but spatially homogeneous veloc-
ity ﬁeld with ∇p, ∇µ = 0, the Navier-Stokes equation
reduces to ∂tg = 0, or ̺ ∂tv − χ ∂2
t v = 0, which (in ad-
dition to the usual v = const) obviously also contains
the run-away solution ∼ e(̺/χ)t. Similarly, with a mo-
mentum density that contains the acceleration ∂tui, the
Eckart choice cannot help to avoid an analogous instable
solution.

This would represent an independent argument favor-
ing the LL choice, except that — as observed by Hiscock
and Lindblom [10] — in frames moving with respect to
the ﬂuid the diﬀusion equations in the LL theory also de-
velop diverging solutions, which grow exponentially with
microscopically short characteristic times. For lack of
space, we brieﬂy summerize our reasons for believing that
this frame-dependent instability does not constitute suf-
ﬁcient ground to reject the LL choice, and promise a
detailed account in a forthcoming paper. Consider the

2

2

parabolic diﬀusion equation, ∂tϑ − α ∂2
xϑ = 0. Its char-
acteristics are the lines t = const, and only if the initial
values are prescribed on one of these, do we have a sin-
gle bound mode, δϑ eikx−αk
t, with k ∈ IR [11]. Initial
data on a non-characteristic curve, say x + β t = const,
β ∈ IR, generally produce two independent solutions. For
the simplest case of β = 0, they are δϑ1 e−i(Ωx+ωt)eΩx
for x < 0 and δϑ2 ei(Ωx−ωt)e−Ωx for x > 0, with Ω ≡
(ω/2α)1/2, ω ∈ IR. In the respective wrong region, one
solution appears unbound. Being invariant with respect
to coordinate transformations, the characteristics of the
boosted diﬀusion equation that Hiscock and Lindblom
consider are t = γ(˜t + v ˜x) = const, with t the proper
time. The solutions they examine, however, satisfy ini-
tial data on the non-characteristic ˜t = const, where ˜t
is the time in the moving frame. So the appearance of
an unbound solution for ˜t → ∞ is a mathematical conse-
quence to be expected. Nevertheless, the diverging mode,
being absent in the rest frame, must not be observable
in a moving one. And it is not, as it only exists for
negative times ˜t, and decays for ˜t → −∞ within a micro-
scopically brief period that is outside the hydrodynamic
regime.
In fact, this mode is just one of those signals
discussed above that run backwards in time in moving
(These arguments do not apply to the Eckart
frames.
instability.
It happens in the ﬂuid’s rest frame, where
any deviation from the non-relativistic hydrodynamics is
worrisome.)

The extended theories are stable for both choices of the
4-velocity if linearized; though the Eckart version turns
instable again if non-linear terms are included [12].

We conclude: Within its range of validity, the rel-
ativistic hydrodynamics is just as healthy as the non-
relativistic theory. If someone is willing to put up with a
few acausal consequences, blatant but recognizably out-
side this range, he retains the beneﬁt of a simpler theory.
If not, he may resort to the extended theory — though
it has to be one that adheres to the LL choice of the
4-velocity.

Let us now consider the hydrodynamics in greater de-
tails, starting again with the non-relativistic version. The
equations of motion for the thermodynamic variables of
Eq. (1) are,

∂ts + ∇·f = R/T ,
∂tgi + ∂kΠik = 0 ,

∂tǫ + ∇·q = 0 ,
∂t̺ + ∇·j = 0 .

We explicitly include the conserved quantity

I ≡ R d3x (̺ x − g t) = M X(t) − G t

(3)

(4)

(5)

in our consideration, where M , G, and X(t) denote the
total mass, the total momentum, and the center-of-mass
coordinate, respectively. Clearly, I/M is the initial coor-
dinate of the center of mass, so we may perhaps refer to
I as the center-of-mass inertial coordinate (comic), and
to i ≡ ̺ x − g t as the comic density.

Neither the angular momentum nor the comic re-
quires an independent equation of motion. Writing
∂t(εikm xk gm) = −∂n(εikm xk Πmn) + εikm Πmk, one
ﬁnds that the angular momentum density εikm xk gm
obeys a continuity equation only if Πik = Πki. Analo-
gously, ∂t(̺ xi − gi t) = −∂k(jk xi − Πik t) + ji − gi holds
for the comic density, a locally conserved quantity, hence
g = j. This concludes the clear cut and simple proof we
were looking for.

Next we deduce thermodynamic equilibrium condi-
tions including the conservation of the comic I. Max-
imizing the total entropy S = R d3x s subject to the con-
servation of energy, momentum, mass, angular momen-
tum, and comic, we have R d3x {δs − λ1 δǫ + Λ1 · δg +
λ2 δ̺ + Λ2 ·δ(x × g) − Λ3 ·δ(̺ x − g t)} = 0, where the
eleven coeﬃcients λ1,2 and Λ1,2,3 are constant Lagrange
parameters. Employing Eq. (1), we deduce, for arbitrary
variations δǫ, δ̺ and δg (with δx = δt = 0),

1/T = λ1, µ/T = λ2 − Λ3 ·x,
v/T = Λ1 + Λ2 × x + Λ3 t.

(6a)

(6b)

The last expression does not imply an accelerating mo-
mentum, as Dixon concluded in Ch.4 §4d of Ref. [5]. To
see this directly, consider uniform space and time trans-
lations: Setting now δx, δt = const, and requiring that
the equilibrium conditions remain unaltered, we arrive at

M Λ3 = −Λ2 × G

(6c)

and the dependent Λ3 ·G = 0. Together, the equi-
librium conditions (6) are explicitly Galilean covariant:
Introducing the chemical potential µ0 = µ + 1
2 v2 of
the local rest-frame, they can be expressed as T = ¯T ,
µ0 = ¯µ + 1
2 [Ω × (x − X)]2, v = V + Ω × (x − X),
with X = X(t) being the center-of-mass coordinate, and
¯T , ¯µ, V, Ω redeﬁned constants. Clearly, µ0 (and hence
the density ̺) only depends on the rotation velocity in
the center-of-mass frame, and not on the center-of-mass
motion. Without including the comic I (ie.
setting
Λ3 = 0 above) LL obtained, in a similar calculation [13],
v = V + Ω × x, and concluded that the equilibrium ve-
locity v of a general frame has to be a constant of time.
But this is clearly only correct in special frames, when
V k Ω.

Now Eq. (2) is derived. First we remark that the un-
usual form of the thermodynamic force ∇µ + ∂tv is a
natural consequence of Eqs. (6): This combination van-
ishes in equilibrium and may therefore serve as a le-
gitimate thermodynamic force. More technically, given
the existence of jD = j − ̺ v, both g and ǫ acquire a
dissipative part, g = gEq + jD and ǫ = ǫEq + v · jD.
Substituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into the Gibbs relation,
T ∂ts = ∂tǫEq − v · ∂tgEq − µ ∂t̺, one obtains the entropy
production R = −jD·(∇µ+∂tv)+· · ·, from which Eq. (2)
[with χ > 0, such that R > 0] results.

Turning our attention to special relativity, the relevant

hydrodynamic equations (1), (3), and (4) generalize to

T dsµ = −uν dT νµ − µ dnµ ,
∂µ(sµ + σµ) = R/T ,
∂ν (T µν + τ µν ) = 0 , ∂µ(nµ + νµ) = 0 .

Notations: Greek indices run from 1 to 4, Latin indices
only to 3; the speed of light is unity; the metric is ηµν =
diag(1, 1, 1, −1); the coordinate 4-vector is xµ = (x, t),
so ∂µ = (∇, ∂t); the 4-velocity is uµ = γ(v, 1) with
γ ≡ (1 − v2)−1/2, hence uµ uµ = −1; σµ, τ µν , and νµ
are the respective dissipative parts of the entropy 4-ﬂux,
energy-momentum tensor, and particle 4-ﬂux, they have
a diﬀerent parity under time reversal from their reactive
counterparts and vanish in equilibrium.

In the laboratory frame, in which the local ﬂuid veloc-
ity is v, the reactive, equilibrium terms are: sµ = suµ,
T µν = (e + p)uµuν + p ηµν, and nµ = nuµ, where
p = −e + T s + µ n is the pressure, e = ǫ0 + ̺ the den-
sity of total energy, n = ̺/m the particle number den-
sity, and s as before the entropy density, all taken from
a local comoving frame. The last three are related by
T ds = de − µ dn, so µ = m(∂ǫ0/∂̺) + m has a diﬀer-
ent deﬁnition than in the Galilean case, but p does not.
The relativistic version of the Gibbs relation, Eq. (7),
is obtained by multiplying the rest-frame relation with
uµ. The conservation of the 4-angular momentum is en-
sured by the symmetry of the energy-momentum tensor:
T µν = T νµ and τ µν = τ νµ. As discussed, this includes
the equality of the momentum density and the total en-
ergy ﬂux.

Now consider the explicit form of the dissipative terms
σµ, τ µν , and νµ. They are determined by the rate of en-
tropy production R, a positive Lorentz scalar. Inserting
Eqs. (8) and (9) in (7), and requiring R to be a sum of
products of thermodynamic ﬂuxes and forces, we arrive
at T σµ = −uν τ νµ − µ νµ and

R/T = −τ µν ∂(µ[uν)/T ] − νµ∂µ(µ/T ) ,

(10)

where the bracket denotes symmetrization, eg. ∂(µuν) ≡
(∂µuν + ∂νuµ)/2. Global equilibrium conditions are met
if the two forces ∂(µ[uν)/T ] and ∂µ(µ/T ) vanish.
Ir-
reversible thermodynamics generally prescribes the On-
sager ansatz, setting τ µν and νµ as linear combinations of
∂(µ[uν)/T ] and ∂µ(µ/T ) — subject to the requirements
that thermodynamic variables do not possess any dissi-
pative counterparts in the local rest-frame (lrf). The
thermodynamic variables of Eq. (7) reduce to s4 = s,
T µ4 = (g, e), and n4 = n in the lrf. So the lack of
dissipative counterparts implies σ4 = τ µ4 = ν4 = 0, of
which the covariant expressions are,

It must have been a source of confusion that g itself
vanishes in the lrf — reducing T µ4 to T 44 = e, and
seemingly leaving only τ 44 = 0. This overinterprets the
lrf. What we actually need is to examine the inﬁnites-
imal changes of the variables, dT µ4 = (dg, de), and un-
derstand that the lrf does not imply dg = 0, as we must
allow for ∂tg, ∂igk 6= 0. Non-relativistically, of course, g
being a thermodynamic variable is never disputed.

It is not incidental that the conditions (11) rule out
any time derivative in R. Violating (11), we ﬁnd from
Eq. (10): τ i4 ∼ ∂tui, τ 44 ∼ ∂tT , ν4 ∼ ∂t(µ/T ) in the
lrf.
In the equations of motion, each yields its own
run-away solution, altogether ﬁve. Eckart’s conditions,
uµ σµ = uµ uν τ µν = νµ = 0, partly violate Eqs. (11), so
it is not surprising that his “momentum of heat” τ i4 ∼
∂tui gives rise to the instable solution discussed above.

The covariant hydrodynamic theory that entails the
4-velocity as proposed by LL is the appropriate theory
to employ if the velocity diﬀerence in the system is no
longer small when compared to light velocity. However,
it does not consider charges and electric currents that are
frequently present in astrophysical systems. For this, one
needs in addition the covariant version of the dissipative
Maxwell equations [14], to be published elsewhere.

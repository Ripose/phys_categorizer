Universality and Critical Exponents in Fully Developed Turbulence

Abstract

Multi-fractal model for dissipation ﬁeld has been used to provide a detailed structure for the critical
exponent σ describing the scaling form of dissipation ǫ that appears to exhibit an interesting universality
covering radically diﬀerent hydrodynamic fully developed turbulence (FDT) systems. This result also appears
to provide a consistent framework for classiﬁcation of dissipation ﬁeld into critical, subcritical and supercritical
cases. Some FDT problems that exemplify these cases are discussed.

is believed to possess,

Small-scale structure in three-dimensional (3D)
following Kolmogorov’s [1]
incompressible FDT,
epoch-making work,
in the
large Reynolds number (R ⇒ ∞) limit, a certain
universality in its scaling properties. This universal
scaling behavior depends only on dimensionality and
symmetries of the system and is unaﬀected by the
large-scale ﬂow structure which depends on the par-
ticular external stirring mechanisms generating FDT.

This is reminiscent of the scaling behavior near
the critical point where many diverse systems show a
striking similarity in their behavior (Stanley [2] and
[3], Fisher [4]). Therefore, an enormous eﬀort has
been directed towards the investigation of critical ex-
ponents which unify diverse physical phenomena near
their critical points. Critical phenomena had a the-
oretical breakthrough in the renormalization group
(RG) (Kadanoﬀ [5] and Wilson [6]) which was the
culmination of the ideas of scaling and universality.
The RG idea was attempted for the FDT problem
(Nelkin [7], Rose and Sulem [8], Yakhot and Orszag
[9], Kraichnan [10] and Eyink and Goldenfeld [11]).
The goal is to determine the critical exponents (like
those associated with correlation length in critical lat-
tice spin systems) that are intrinsic features of the
FDT dynamics and not artifacts of the large-scale
stirring mechanisms.

Spatial intermittency is a common feature of FDT
and implies that turbulence activity at small scales
is not distributed uniformly throughout space. This
leads to a violation of an assumption in the Kol-
mogorov [1] theory that the statistical quantities
show no dependence in the inertial range L ≫ ℓ ≫ η
on the large scale L and the Kolmogorov microscale
η = (ν3/ǫ)1/4 (where the viscous eﬀects become im-

portant). Thus, if one views the Kolmogorov [1] the-
ory as a mean ﬁeld theory (Landau [12]), the spatial
intermittency aspects, as Landau [13] pointed out,
will be expected to deﬁne at least one additional uni-
versal scaling exponent. Spatial intermittency eﬀects
can be very conveniently imagined to be related to the
fractal aspects of the geometry of FDT (Mandelbrot
[14]). The mean energy dissipation ﬁeld ǫ may then
be assumed, in a ﬁrst approximation, to be concen-
trated on a homogeneous fractal (Frisch et al. [15]),
and more generally, on a multi-fractal2 (Frisch and
Parisi [18]). The latter idea has received experimen-
tal support (Meneveau and Sreenivasan [19]).

In the R ⇒ ∞ limit (which corresponds to the
critical point for FDT) inﬁnitely many length scales
become important. So, by analogy with critical phe-
nomena, one may expect many macroscopic details
(like anisotropic aspects of the large-scale ﬂow struc-
ture in a particular situation) to become irrelevant
and the critical behaviors of radically diﬀerent FDT
systems to exhibit some universality. Further, this
universality may be expected to be strongly rooted in
the self-similarity of the system at the critical point,
just as that for a ﬁnite critical ferromagnet system,
via the multi-fractal structure of the ǫ-ﬁeld (Kadanoﬀ
[20]).

One of the fundamental dynamical assumptions
underlying FDT theory is that ǫ remains ﬁnite in the
R ⇒ ∞ limit (see Meneveau and Sreenivasan [19] for
experimental support for this assumption). This im-
plies that if one identiﬁes ǫ as the order parameter,
then the critical exponent σ deﬁned by

ǫ ∼ Rσ, R ⇒ ∞

σ = 0.

2A singular measure deﬁned on a multi-fractal is represented in terms of interwoven fractal subsets corresponding to diﬀerent
measure levels having a continuous spectrum of scaling exponents. Therefore, inﬁnitely many generalized fractal dimensions
Dq are needed to give a statistical characterization of the diversity of scaling in a multi-fractal (Mandelbrot [16], [17]).

This aspect has also been validated by the multi-
fractal model for the ǫ-ﬁeld (Nelkin [21]). The pur-
pose of this letter is to report that the multi-fractal
model indeed provides a detailed structure for the
critical exponent σ that appears to exhibit an inter-
esting universality covering radically diﬀerent FDT
systems.

In the multi-fractal model for the classical 3D
FDT system, one stipulates that the ﬁne-scale regime
of FDT possesses a range of scaling exponents α ∈
I ≡ [αmin, αmax]. Each α ∈ I has the support set
S(α) ⊂ R3 of fractal dimension f (α)3 such that, as
ℓ ⇒ 0, the velocity increment has the scaling behav-
ior

δV (ℓ) ∼ ℓα.
(3)
The sets δ(α) are nested so that S(α′) ⊂ S(α), for
α′ < α.

On extrapolating this multi-fractal scaling in the
inertial range down to the Kolmogorov microscale η,
the latter is found to exhibit the scaling behavior
(Nelkin [21])

establishing the inviscid dissipation of enstrophy in
the enstrophy cascade of classical 2D FDT. Further,
(22) implies that the τ -ﬁeld (like the ǫ-ﬁeld in classical
3D FDT) is concentrated on a fractal whose dimen-
sion DQ is equal to the information entropy dimension
D1.

These results imply that classical 3D and the en-
strophy cascade of 2D FDT are indeed examples of
the critical dissipation ﬁeld which -

• is concentrated on a fractal whose dimension is
equal to the information entropy dimension D1,

• has a ﬁnite mean value in the inviscid limit.

This suggests further that we may deﬁne a subcriti-
cal/supercritical dissipation ﬁeld as one which -

• is concentrated on a fractal whose dimension
is less/greater than the information entropy di-
mension D1,

• has an inﬁnite/vanishing mean value in the in-

viscid limit;

As an example of a subcritical dissipation ﬁeld,
consider the 2D geostrophic FDT system in which
the baroclinic eﬀects are produced by the deformed
free-surface of the ocean (Shivamoggi [24]). The scal-
ing behavior of the moments of the vorticity gradient
distribution in the enstorphy cascade is given by

(31)

So, the enstrophy dissipation in the enstrophy cas-
cade for the 2D geostrophic FDT system diverges5 in
the inviscid limit in accordance with the ﬁrst of the
above stipulations for the subcritical dissipation ﬁeld.
Further, (29) implies that the enstrophy dissipation
ﬁeld is concentrated on a fractal whose dimension DQ
is less6 than the information entropy dimension D1 in
accordance with the second of the above stipulations
for the subcritical dissipation ﬁeld.

The universality of the spatial intermittency as-
pects in FDT systems, on the other hand, would im-
ply that the criticality, subcriticality or supercritical-
ity of the dissipation ﬁeld should be traceable to prop-
erties like the probability density function (PDF) in
the zero intermittency limit of the FDT system in
question.

The identity of (33) and (32) appears to conﬁrm
that both classical 3D and the enstrophy cascade of
2D FDT are examples of the critical dissipation ﬁeld.
On the other hand, the PDF of the vorticity
gradient in the zero intermittency limit for the 2D
geostrophic FDT is given by (Shivamoggi [27])

(34)

which is more non-Gaussian than (33) and is con-
sistent with the fact that 2D geostrophic FDT is an
example of a subcritical dissipation ﬁeld.

In conclusion, according to the multi-fractal
model for dissipation ﬁeld, the order parameter ǫ (or
τ ) in a variety of hydrodynamic FDT cases has a
scaling form

ǫ ∼ Rσ, R ⇒ ∞

(35a)

with the apparently universal critical exponent

5This is physically plausible because, thanks to the vortex stretching eﬀect produced by the deformed free surface, geostrophic

ﬂows, in the baroclinic limit, are more dissipative than the classical 2D ﬂows (Shivamoggi [24]).
6DQ can be shown (Grassberger and Proccacia [25]) to be monotonically decreasing with Q.

DQ being the fractal dimension of the region where
the dissipation ﬁeld is concentrated. Q ⋚ 1 corre-
sponds to supercritical, critical (of which classical 3D
and enstrophy cascade of 2D FDT are examples), and
subcritical (of which 2D geostrophic FDT is an ex-
ample) dissipation-ﬁeld cases. On ﬁrst thought, the
universality of critical exponent σ would appear to be
rather far-fetched because the various cases of FDT
are far too diverse to be characterized within a uni-
versality class. But, as Kadanoﬀ [20] speculated, by
focusing on the critical point (R ⇒ ∞) behavior, it
is apparently possible to do just that. However, an
important outstanding issue at this point is to un-
derstand why and how this universality comes into
being.

7Consideration of non-hydrodynamic FDT cases (like the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) FDT cases (Shivamoggi [28]), one
of which provides an example of a supercritical dissipation ﬁeld) conﬁrms the universality of the form of the critical exponent σ
but with a diﬀerent amplitude (which is the number in front of the factor (Q − 1) in (35b)) which appears to reﬂect the residual
eﬀect of variations in the cascade physics (like those in the MHD cases). This is totally in accord with the idea of universality
which implies that near a critical point all systems can be grouped into a relatively small number of classes (depending on
the speciﬁc dynamics) with identical critical exponents within each class (Hohenberg and Halperin [29]). These results will be
reported elsewhere.

Abstract

The states of asymptotic relaxation of 2-dimensional ﬂuids and plasma present
a high degree of regularity and obey to the sinh-Poisson equation. We ﬁnd that
embedding the classical ﬂuid description into a ﬁeld-theoretical framework, the same
equation appears as a manifestation of the self-duality.

The states generated by externally driving (stirring) an ideal ﬂuid can have very
irregular form. It is however known from experiments and numerical simulations that after
suppressing the drive the system evolves to states with high degree of order, essentially
consisting of few large vortices, with very regular geometry. These states are attained
after long time evolution and are not due to the residual dissipation. The process consists
of vortex merging, which is an essentially topological event where the weak dissipation
only allows the reconnection of the ﬁeld lines but does not produce signiﬁcant energy
loss from the ﬂuid motion. Inferring from results of numerical simulations, Montgomery
et al.
[1], [2] have proved that the scalar stream function ψ describing the motion in
two-dimensional space obeys in the far asymtotic regime (where the regular structures
are dominant) the sinh-Poisson equation

where γ and β are positive constants. The relations of ψ to the velocity and vorticity
are v = ∇ψ ×
ez is the unitary vector perpendicular

to the plane. With these variables, the Euler equations for the two dimensional ideal
incompressible ﬂuid are

We will try to develop a ﬁeld-theoretical model of the stationary asymptotic relaxed
states, i.e. we look for a model that could provide a derivation of Eq.(1). This will be done
progressively, examining models ellaborated for closely related problems and collecting the
relevant suggestions that could allow us to write a Lagrangian density.

In the study of the two-dimensional Euler ﬂuids, and in particular in explaining the
origin of Eq.(1), an important model consists of a system of N discrete vorticity ﬁlaments
perpendicular on plane, having circular transversal section of radius a and carrying the

vorticity ωi, i = 1, N. A very comprehensive account of this system is given by Kraichnan
and Montgomery [3] where the correspondence between the continuous and discrete rep-
resentations of vorticity is discussed in detail. The motion in plane of the k-th ﬁlament
of coordinates rk ≡ (r1

where the summation is over all the other ﬁlaments’ positions rn, n 6= k, and εij is
the antisymmetric tensor in two dimensions. As shown in Ref.[3] G (rk − rn) can be
approximated for a small compared to the space extension of the ﬂuid, L, a ≪ L, as the

The statistical properties of the system of discrete vortices have been examined using
the Liouville theorem and the conservation of energy and momentum . The model consists
of an equal number of positive and negative vortices with equal absolute magnitudes |ωi| =
|ω|, in contact with a thermal bath of temperature T . The possibility of the generation of
two supervortices of opposite signs arises when T is negative and suﬃciently large. When
the most probable state is attained for a stationary conﬁguration the stream function ψ
is shown to verify the sinh-Poisson equation (1). These statistical considerations remain
the reference explanation for the appearence of this equation in this context.

Highly ordered states have been obtained by numerical simulations for other systems
in two spatial dimensions: systems of ﬁlaments of electric current in 2-dimensional MHD,
guiding centre particles. The asymptotic states are found to be described by scalar func-
tions obeying Liouville equation or sinh-Poisson equation. The theoretical approach which
permitted to explain this result was based on the extremum of the entropy over a statis-
tical ensemble of states of a set of discrete objects under the constraints which express
the conservation of the invariants of motion and with a negative temperature.

In the equations of motion (3) the right hand side contains the curl of the Laplacian

The term in right hand side of (3) can be seen as a vector potential a (r, t). The “magnetic”
ﬁeld ∇ × a is a sum of Dirac δ functions at the locations of the vortices. If we take equal
strength ω for all vortices this potential appears as the “statistical potential” and has a
topological interpretation [4]. From (5) it can be rewritten

where r = (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ). The “magnetic” ﬂux through a surface limitted by a
large circle is proportional with the number of vortices. The topological nature of this
potential suggests that it can be naturally derived in a topological framework, i.e. from
a Lagrangian density of the Chern-Simons type,

L =

εµαβAνFαβ

(7)

where Fαβ = ∂αAβ − ∂βAα. In the analysis for the two-dimensional Euler equation (as
in the investigation of similar systems), the vorticity-type functions ω are expressed as
the Lapacian operator applied on a scalar function and this naturally invokes the Green
function of the Laplacian. Then this approach suggests that the intrinsically determined
motion of the ﬂuid can be projected onto two distinct parts of a new model: objects
(vortices) and interaction between them (the potential obtained from the Green function).
The fact that the interaction potential can be derived from a Chern-Simons topological
action suggests that, in order to embedd the original Euler ﬂuid system into a larger
ﬁeld theoretical context, we need (a) a “matter” part in the Lagrangian, which should
provide the free dynamics of the vortices; (b) the Chern-Simons term, to describe the
free dynamics of the ﬁeld; (c) the interaction term of the (Chern-Simons-) ﬁeld and the
matter. The main requirement to this ﬁeld-theoretical extension of the original Euler ﬂuid
model is to reproduce the discrete vortices and their equation of motion.

Jackiw and Pi [5], [6] have examined a model of N interacting particles (of charges es)

(10)

Here B = εij∂jAi. In these equations the potential appears as being generated by the
matter, i.e. by the “current” of particles. We note that the Eq.(9) connects the matter
density with the curl of the potential. This is important since in order to derive it in the
context of the quantum version of their model, Jackiw and Pi have shown that one needs
to include a nonlinear self-interaction of the wave function representing the matter ﬁeld.
The self-interaction of the scalar matter ﬁeld is of the type ϕ4. The canonical momentum

B = −ρ

Ei = εijjj

expression becomes the covariant derivative in the ﬁeld theory version. Even at this point
where we only have some hints, it is suggestive to look for possible identiﬁcations between
the ﬂuid variables and the ﬁeld theoretical variables of the model of Jackiw and Pi. The
ﬂuid variables are: the scalar potential ψ, the velocity vi = εij∂jψ and the vorticity
ω = εij∂ivj. In order to check the possibility that the ﬂuid model can be embedded into
the ﬁeld theory just described we identify

Consider the relation between the vector potential A and the density ρ, obtained from
Eq.(9)

or, writting symbolically the Green function of the Laplace operator for argument r − r′
as the inverse of the operator at the left, we have

which conﬁrms (12). It results that if we assume the identiﬁcation (11) the equation (9)
obtained form the Lagrangian is precisely the deﬁnition of the vorticity vector.

One important hint from the model of Jackiw and Pi is the idea to represent a classical
quantity as the modulus of a ﬁctitious complex scalar ﬁeld, as in Eq.(11) and derive
dynamical equations from a Lagrangian density expressed in terms of this ﬁeld. The
substitution of the dynamics expressed in terms of usual mechanical quantities by the
richer dynamics of the amplitude and phase of the complex scalar ﬁeld is an example of
embedding of one theory into a larger framework and relies on the example of quantum
mechanics.

In Ref.([7]) the sinh-Poisson equation is derived in a ﬁeld theoretical model where
In that
instead of the topological coupling two complex scalar ﬁelds are considered.
model the dynamics of the two scalar ﬁelds is independent except that the self-interaction
depends on both. Combining this suggestion with the one exposed in the previous para-
graph, we will take the density ρ (which we identify with the local value of the vorticity
ω as in Eq.(11) ) as a two-component complex ﬁeld Ψ

where the potantial A takes values in the algebra of the group SU (2). This form in-
corporates and adapt all the suggestions from the previous models: (a) the ﬁrst term is
the general non-Abelian expression of the Chern-Simons term; (b) it uses the covariant
derivatives (µ = 0, 1, 2, i = 1, 2) for the minimal coupling

DµΨ = ∂µΨ + [Aµ, Ψ]

(c) Finally, it includes a scalar self-interaction of ϕ4 type. Analogous to the case treated
by Jackiw and Pi for the U (1) gauge ﬁeld (8), in Ref.[8] it is shown that the Hamiltonian
density corresponding to the Lagrangian density (14) is

Choosing a constant diﬀerent of unity in Eq.(24) imposes a linear substitution of the
stream function : ψ → ψ′ ≡ γ + βψ and modiﬁes the factor multiplying the sinh function
in Eq.(27).

We have constructed the Lagrangian density (14) with a standard structure of matter-
gauge ﬁeld interaction and incorporating suggestions from models relevant for our objec-
tive. The aim was to reproduce the model of ﬂuid vortex ﬁlaments supposed to be a
faithfull representation of the original Euler ﬂuid dynamics. The fundamental step in the
derivation of the sinh-Poisson equation is the assumption that the energy density (18) is
minimum (which is equivalent to minimizing the action for these stationary solution) i.e.
in the condition of self-duality.

We conclude that the Euler ﬂuid equations can be embedded into a ﬁeld theoretical
framework via the discrete model of vortex ﬁlaments. This framework is able to provide
the equation obeyed by the scalar stream function at stationarity and this is precisely the
equation inferred from numerical experiments. The particularity of the ﬁeld theoretical
framework is that it shows that the asymptotic states consisting of regular vortices corre-
spond to self-dual states in ﬁeld theory. This might have deep signiﬁcance and deserves
further investigation.

One must also note that the statistical-theoretical model able to explain the sinh-
Poisson equation [11], [12], [13], [14] appears to have strong and deep connections with
the self-duality. It should be carefully considered as a possible approach in the study of
models where self-duality is known to exist, like O (n) or Self-Dual Yang-Mills theory.

Introduction

The traditional algorithm of collisional process in DSMC method, used for
calculation of velocities of molecules after collision, is based on the conser-
vation laws for linear momentum and total energy [1]. This algorithm does
not provide conservation of angular momentum with respect to some axis,
but for non-rotating ﬂow this circumstance is insigniﬁcant, since the mean
value of angular momentum of such kind of ﬂow is equal to zero.
The situation changes for axisymmetric ﬂow with rotation.
In this case
the traditional procedure leads to some internal source or sink of angular
momentum that may distort the ﬂowﬁeld.
In the paper the discussed eﬀect is recognized and investigated. The angular
momentum conservative (AMC) algorithm of collisional process is proposed.
The draft version of the paper is published in [2].

2 Problem Formulation

The investigations were made for one-dimensional axisymmetric ﬂow of
monoatomic gas in the tube with specular wall. The evolution of initially
swirling ﬂow during the time was studied. The gas in the tube with uniform
initial density n0 and temperature T0 and equilibrium distribution function
was assumed to start rotating as a solid body, the initial tangential velocity
on the wall being equal to vϕ. For given molecular model the problem con-
tains two governing parameters: the Knudsen number Kn, deﬁned by the
ratio of the mean free path l0 in the gas at t = 0 to the radius of the tube
rt

and the speed ratio

The simulations were made on uniform grid with 104 simulated molecules.
Standard NTC DSMC procedure [1] was applied.
The initial values of total mass M0, angular momentum I0 and energy E0
of the gas may be deﬁned by the relations

where N0 is the total number of simulated molecules, m - the mass of
molecule, V - the velocity vector, v - the tangential component of this
vector. By the same relations may be determined the total energy E and
total angular momentum I of the gas during the time.
For any values of Kn and Sϕ there should be no temporal dependence of E
and I. The computations show that this condition is satisﬁed only for E.
Fig.1 illustrates the dependencies of I/I0 on the time for some of considered
variants for Sϕ = 1. The time is normalized by the value of t0 = 2 π rt/vϕ,
so t/t0 represents the number of revolutions of solid body with v(rt) = vϕ.
As can be seen from Fig.1, for all of the variants the decreasing of I/I0 with
increasing of t/t0 is observed. For given Kn the eﬀect is more pronounced
for solid sphere molecules (SS) in comparison with V SS molecular model
for Maxwell molecules (M M ). The eﬀect depends on the Knudsen number:
the less Kn the more the eﬀect. But the highest sensitivity of the eﬀect
is observed to the grid size: changing the number N of cells from 50 to 25
causes the same eﬀect as the decrease of the Knudsen number approximately
by 4 times.
Due to the dependence of I(t) it is diﬃcult to obtain the steady solution
of the problem. The dissipation of rotational contribution of energy into
the heat takes place during the time. The only steady solution that may
be obtained with traditional collisional procedure is terminal one, when at
t
the gas will stop rotating, having uniform density n0 and getting
warm to the temperature

3 AMC Algorithm

The reason of temporal dependence of total angular momentum is quite
clear: the colliding molecules have diﬀerent radial coordinates r1, r2, that

2

leads to the diﬀerence in angular momentum

m1 v1 r1 + m2 v2 r2

of these molecules before and after collision (v denotes the tangential com-
ponent of velocity of the molecule). To provide the conservation of angular
momentum the algorithm of collisional process should be changed. One
possible variant of AMC algorithm is as follows.
Let us denote by u the vector containing axial and radial components of the
velocity of molecule. The post-collision velocities calculated by traditional
, while the symbol ′ will be used for
procedure will be denoted by symbol
these velocities in the proposed algorithm.

The algorithm is based on conservation law of angular momentum m v r for
tangential component of velocity instead of linear momentum m v. That is
why the post-collision tangential velocities are calculated by usual relations
[1], with the value of mi being replaced by the product mi ri. The obtained
velocities v′
2 provide precise conservation of angular momentum, but vio-
late the energy conservation. To provide energy conservation the correction
of velocities u∗
2 is needed. To do this correction the analysis of
energy defects

velocities u∗

3. If none of the above conditions is satisﬁed, the collision is considered to be
”bad” and is not performed, i. e. the molecules conserve their pre-collision
velocities.
The computations show that the relative number of collisions of types 1
and 2 is about 99% and 1%, respectively. The relative number of ”bad”
collisions never exceeds 10−4, so the eﬀect caused by the neglecting of these
collisions is small.

4 Steady Solution

The described algorithm provides precise conservation of angular momen-
tum and energy. All the curves, presented in Fig.1 transform into straight
line I/I0 = 1, if this algorithm is applied.
AMC algorithm enables to obtain the steady solution of the considered
problem. This solution proves to be the same, as the prediction of Navier-
Stokes theory and has the following features.
1. The ﬂow is isothermal

2. The gas rotates as a solid body

T = const

v = vw r/rt

3. The radial distribution of density is described by the relation

n(r) = n(0) exp (v2/2 R T )

(6)

4. The solution is completely determined by the values of M0, I0, E0 and
does not depend on the way of initial swirling.
5. The solution does not depend either on the molecular model or on the
Knudsen number.
These features of the considered ﬂow are important for clarifying the nature
of the Ranque eﬀect [3, 4].
Three unknown values vw, T, n(0) determining the radial distribution of
parameters of steady solution may be deﬁned based on the values of M0, I0
and E0 from the relations

where speed ratio Sw of the ﬂow at r = rt is deﬁned by

Sw = vw/√2 R T

The left hand sides of the relations 7 - 9 representing the total mass, angular
momentum and energy of the ﬂow may be obtained based on the relations
4 - 6 by simple integration.
The comparison between numerical and analytical radial distribution of
parameters of steady ﬂow for V SS molecules, Kn = 0.1, Sϕ = 1, N = 50
is made on Figs. 2 - 4 for density, tangential velocity and temperature,
respectively. The numerical results are shown by solid circles while solid
lines represent the results of analytical solution 7 - 9. As can be seen from
these Figures, numerical and analytical results are in excellent agreement.
For Kn = 10 the steady solution was found to be the same as for Kn = 0.1.
It should be noted that the steady ﬂow in the considered problem is charac-
terized by locally Maxwellian distribution function for any molecular models
and Kn <
AMC algorithm of collisional process may be applied for simulation of non-
rotating ﬂows too. The experience of such application to the ﬂow in gas-
dynamic window [5] shows that the results obtained with proposed and
traditional algorithms are the same within the expected statistical scatter.

To stay the eﬀect of non-conservative nature of traditional collisional proce-
dure in the real conditions, some test computations of considered ﬂow were
made by AMC algorithm for adiabatic tube wall with diﬀuse-specular scat-
tering of molecules for diﬀerent values of accommodation coeﬃcient σ. Fig.5
illustrates the dependencies of I/I0 on the time for V SS molecules, Kn =
10−4.
0.1, Sϕ = 1, N = 50 and 4 values of σ in the range σ = 2
The comparison of these dependencies with those presented in Fig.1 reveals
that the traditional collisional procedure causes the same change in angular
momentum as the diﬀuse-specular wall with the accommodation coeﬃcient

5 Conclusion

The proposed algorithm of collisional process provides precise conservation
of angular momentum and energy and may be used for direct simulation of
ﬂows with rotation.

It should be noted, however, that the improvement of the results, obtained
by this algorithm may be important only for the problems without external
source or sink of angular momentum. If solid surface with diﬀuse reﬂection
is present in the ﬂowﬁeld, the changes in angular momentum, caused by this
surface will be much greater than those, caused by non-conservative nature
of traditional algorithm of collisional process. For such kind of ﬂows there
is no need to employ AMC algorithm, especially taking into account that it
takes 10%

15% more CPU time.

Nevertheless, for some problems the application of AMC algorithm is advis-
able. An example of such kind of problem is the Ranque eﬀect [3], which
nature is determined by conservation of angular momentum of the gas ﬂow
in the vortex tube [4].

Abstract

Certain unresolved ambiguities surround pressure determinations for
incompressible ﬂows, both Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic. For
uniform-density ﬂuids with standard Newtonian viscous terms, taking the
divergence of the equation of motion leaves a Poisson equation for the
pressure to be solved. But Poisson equations require boundary condi-
tions. For the case of rectangular periodic boundary conditions, pressures
determined in this way are unambiguous. But in the presence of “no-slip”
rigid walls, the equation of motion can be used to infer both Dirichlet and
Neumann boundary conditions on the pressure P , and thus amounts to
an over-determination. This has occasionally been recognized as a prob-
lem, and numerical treatments of wall-bounded shear ﬂows usually have
built in some relatively ad hoc dynamical recipe for dealing with it, often
one which appears to “work” satisfactorily. Here we consider a class of
solenoidal velocity ﬁelds which vanish at no-slip walls, have all spatial
derivatives, but are simple enough that explicit analytical solutions for
P can be given. Satisfying the two boundary conditions separately gives
two pressures, a “Neumann pressure” and a “Dirichlet pressure” which
diﬀer non-trivially at the initial instant, even before any dynamics are
implemented. We compare the two pressures, and ﬁnd that in particu-
lar, they lead to diﬀerent volume forces near the walls. This suggests a
reconsideration of no-slip boundary conditions, in which the vanishing of
the tangential velocity at a no-slip wall is replaced by a local wall-friction
term in the equation of motion.

1 Introduction

It has long been the case that pressure determinations for incompressible ﬂows,
both Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), are known to be highly

and using ∇ · v = 0 leaves us with a Poisson equation for the pressure P , which
is said to function as an equation of state:

∇2P = −∇ · (v · ∇v −

)

(2)

Here, v = v(x, t) is the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld as a function of position and time, B is
the magnetic ﬁeld, j = c∇×B/4π is the electric current density, c is the speed of
light, ν is the kinematic viscosity, assumed spatially uniform and constant, and
P is the pressure normalized to ρ the mass density, also spatially uniform. (1)
and (2) are written for MHD. Their Navier-Stokes equivalents can be obtained
simply by dropping the terms containing B and j.

If we are to solve (2) for P , boundary conditions are required. In the im-
mediate neighborhood of a stationary “no-slip” boundary, both the terms on
the left of (1) vanish and we are left with the following equation for ∇P as a
boundary condition:

(3)

∇P = ν∇2v +

j×B
ρc

We now focus on the Navier-Stokes case, where the magnetic terms dis-
appear from (3), for simplicity. All the complications of MHD are illustrated
by this simpler case. It is apparent that (3) must apply to all components of
∇P , and that while the normal component of ∇P is enough to determine P
through Neumann boundary conditions, the tangential components of (3) at
the wall equally well determine P through Dirichlet boundary conditions. This
is a problem which some inventive procedures have been proposed to resolve,
usually by some degree of “pre-processing” or various dynamical recipes which
seem to lead to approximately no-slip velocity ﬁelds after a few time steps (e.g.
[Gresho 1991], [Roache 1982] and [Canuto et al. 1988] ). It is not our purpose
to review or critique these recipes, but rather to focus on a set of velocity ﬁelds,
related to Chandrasekhar-Reid functions [Chandrasekhar 1961], for which (2)
is explicitly soluble at a level where the Neumann or Dirichlet conditions can
be exactly implemented. In § 2, we explore the diﬀerence between the two pres-
sures so arrived at. Then in § 3, we propose a replacement for the long-standing
practice of demanding that all components of a solenoidal v vanish at material
walls, in favor of a replacement by a wall friction term for which the above
mathematical diﬃculty is no longer present. Of course, similar statements and
options will apply to all comparable incompressible MHD problems.

2 Pressure determinations

Restricting attention at present to the Navier-Stokes case, we consider two-
dimen- sional, solenoidal, velocity ﬁelds obtained from the following stream

2

function:

ψ(x, y) = Ckλ cos (kx)[cos (λy) + Akλ cosh (ky)]

(4)

The hyperbolic cosine term in (4) contributes a potential ﬂow velocity compo-
nent to v which makes it possible to demand that v obey two boundary con-
ditions: the vanishing of both components at rigid walls [Chandrasekhar 1961].
The function in (4) is even in x and y, but can obviously be converted into an
odd or mixed one by the appropriate trigonometric substitutions.

The velocity ﬁeld v = ∇ψ×ˆez has only x and y components and is periodic
in x, with an arbitrary wavenumber k. Ckλ is a normalizing constant, and the
constants λ and Akλ can systematically be found numerically to any desired
accuracy so that both components of v vanish at symmetrically placed no-slip
walls at y = a and y = −a. In fact, for given k, an inﬁnite sequence of such
pairs of λ and Akλ can be determined straightforwardly. Thus any such v,
or superposition thereof, is not only solenoidal, but has both components zero
at y = ±a, and all spatial derivatives exist. Moreover, the “source” term, or
∇ · (v · ∇v), from the right hand side of (2), is of a relatively simple nature for
such a v, since every term in it can be written as a product of exponentials of
kx, λy and ky. It is straightforward to ﬁnd an inhomogeneous solution for P ,
which then is the same for all boundary conditions for a given v of the form
stated. To this inhomogeneous part of P must be added a solution of Laplace’s
equation. This can be chosen so that the total P may satisfy either the normal
component of (3) at the walls, or the tangential component of it, but not both.
The determination involves only simple but tedious algebra.

We illustrate, in ﬁgure 1, an arrow plot of the velocity ﬁeld given by choosing
k = π/2, λ = 2.6424 and Akλ = .3499, in units of a = 1. The two pressures re-
sulting from the satisfaction of the normal and tangential components of (3) can
best be compared by comparing their respective values of ∇P , since P itself is
indeterminate up to an additive constant in both cases. In ﬁgure 2, we display, as
an arrow plot, the diﬀerence between the pressure gradients associated with the
velocity ﬁeld shown in ﬁgure 1. We have rewritten (1)-(3) in dimensionless units
for this purpose, with the kinematic viscosity being replaced by the reciprocal of
a Reynolds number, which may be deﬁned as Re = (hv2i/(k2 + λ2))1/2/ν. Here,
the angle brackets refer to the mean of v2 taken over the 2-D box, containing
one period in the x direction and from y = −a to y = a. The value of Re used to
construct ﬁgure 2 is Re = 2293, with the dimensionless version of Ckλ = 5000
in (4). The two pressures are similar but not identical.

In ﬁgure 3, a fractional measure of the diﬀerence between the “Neumann
pressure” PN and the “Dirichlet pressure” PD is exhibited as a contour plot of
the scalar ratio

There is no absolute signiﬁcance to the numerical value of this ratio. It initially

increases with Re approaching a maximum of about 2% near the wall for Re ∼
10. It is considered interesting however, that the fractional diﬀerence is nearly
x-independent where it is largest. That occurs formally because the algebra

reveals it to be dominated by a term which varies as cosh (4ky) − cos (4kx) in a
region where ky ∼

It is amusing but perhaps not signiﬁcant to superpose the velocity ﬁeld from
(4) with a parabolic plane Poiseuille ﬂow of a larger amplitude. The resulting
ﬂow ﬁeld is shown in ﬁgure 4, and it bears a striking but perhaps not signiﬁcant
similarity to the ﬂow patterns seen in two-dimensional plane Poiseuille ﬂow
[Jones & Montgomery 1994] when linear stability thresholds are approached.
The pressure gradient diﬀerence for this case will be fractionally smaller than
in ﬁgure 3, since pure parabolic plane Poiseuille ﬂow is a rare case where the
two pressures happen to agree, and it quantitatively dominates the pressures
determined from equation (2) in this example.

3 Discussion and a possible modiﬁcation

An alternative to the no-slip condition is the “Navier” boundary condition
[Lamb 1932]: the slip velocity at the wall surface is taken to be proportional to
the rate of shear at the wall. This may be expressed ∆V = Ls ˙γ where ∆V is the
slip velocity of the ﬂuid at the wall, ˙γ is the rate of shear at the wall and Ls is a

constant with the dimensions length. Molecular dynamic simulations of Newto-
nian liquids under shear [Thompson & Robbins 1990] have shown this to be the
case under some circumstances. In fact recent work [Thompson & Troian 1997]
has shown that, in cases where the shear rate is large, there is a nonlinear
relationship between Ls and ˙γ.

We note that the velocity ﬁeld shown in ﬁgure 1 does not lead to one which
obeys the Navier boundary condition, after an initial time step, where the ﬂuid
has been allowed to slip at the wall. If the velocity ﬁeld determined by (4) is
advanced in time using (1) with the “Neumann pressure”, the proportionality
between the slip velocity and the rate of shear at the wall, after the initial time
step, varies sinusoidally with x.

It is to be stressed that we are concerned here only with initial conditions,
not with circumstances under which initial slip velocities might be coaxed dy-
namically into vanishing after some time.

It is diﬃcult to see in what sense the velocity ﬁeld obtained from (4) might
be an unacceptable one from the point of view of the Navier-Stokes or MHD
descriptions. It seems to have all the properties that are thought to be rele-
vant. The family of functions of the same x-periodicity in (4) can be shown
to be orthogonal, and is a candidate for a complete set, in which any v might

be expanded, when supplemented by ﬂux-bearing functions of y alone. The
mathematical question of which if any velocity ﬁelds, which are both solenoidal
and vanish at the wall, would lead to Neumann and Dirichlet pressures that
were in agreement with each other, must remain open. Indeed, the question of
whether there are any, without some degree of “pre-processing,” must remain
open. This is an unsatisfactory situation for ﬂuid mechanics and MHD, in our
opinion, even if it is a not unfamiliar one. The search for alternatives seems
mandatory.

One alternative that may be explored is one that seemed some time ago, in
a rather diﬀerent context [Shan & Montgomery 1994a,b], to have worked well
enough for MHD. Namely, we may think of replacing the requirement of the
vanishing of the tangential velocity at a rigid wall with a wall friction term,
added to the right hand side of (1), of the form

where the coeﬃcient 1/τ (x) vanishes in the interior of the ﬂuid and rises sharply

to rise should be smaller than the characteristic thickness of any boundary
layer that it might be intended to resolve, but seems otherwise not particularly
restrictive. Such a term provides a mechanism for momentum loss to the wall
and constrains the tangential velocity to small values, but does not force it to
zero. The Dirichlet boundary condition disappears in favor of a relation that
permits the time evolution of the tangential components of v, while demanding
that P be determined solely by the Neumann condition (the normal component
of (3) only).
In a previous MHD application [Shan & Montgomery 1994a,b]
dealing with rotating MHD ﬂuids, the scheme seemed to perform acceptably
well, but was not intensively tested or benchmarked sharply against any of the
better understood Navier-Stokes ﬂows. This comparison seems worthy of future
attention.

The work of one of us (D.C.M.) was supported by hospitality in the Fluid
Dynamics Laboratory at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Nether-
lands. A preliminary account of this work was presented orally at a meeting of
the American Physical Society [Kress & Montgomery 1999].

The linearized Navier-Stokes equations for a system of superposed immiscible compressible ideal
ﬂuids are analyzed. The results of the analysis reconcile the stabilizing and destabilizing eﬀects of
compressibility reported in the literature. It is shown that the growth rate n obtained for an inviscid,
compressible ﬂow in an inﬁnite domain is bounded by the growth rates obtained for the corresponding
incompressible ﬂows with uniform and exponentially varying density. As the equilibrium pressure at
the interface p∞ increases (less compressible ﬂow), n increases towards the uniform density result,
while as the ratio of speciﬁc heats γ increases (less compressible ﬂuid), n decreases towards the
exponentially varying density incompressible ﬂow result. This remains valid in the presence of
surface tension or for viscous ﬂuids and the validity of the results is also discussed for ﬁnite size
domains. The critical wavenumber imposed by the presence of surface tension is unaﬀected by
compressibility. However, the results show that the surface tension modiﬁes the sensitivity of the
growth rate to a diﬀerential change in γ for the lower and upper ﬂuids. For the viscous case, the
linearized equations are solved numerically for diﬀerent values of p∞ and γ. It is found that the
largest diﬀerences compared with the incompressible cases are obtained at small Atwood numbers.
The most unstable mode for the compressible case is also bounded by the most unstable modes
corresponding to the two limiting incompressible cases.

INTRODUCTION

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which occurs due to the gravitational instability of a heavy ﬂuid overlying a lighter
ﬂuid,1,2 is of fundamental importance in a multitude of applications ranging from the turbulent mixing in Inertial
Conﬁnement Fusion3,4 to astrophysical phenomena.5,6 Small perturbations of the interface between the two ﬂuids
grow to large amplitudes. At early times, for small enough initial perturbations, the ﬂow can be described by the
linearized equations and the amplitude grows exponentially. Later, the interface evolves into bubbles of lighter ﬂuid
and spikes of heavier ﬂuid penetrating the opposed ﬂuid. If the initial interface is randomly perturbed then bubbles
and spikes of diﬀerent sizes are generated. Mathematically, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is an ill-posed problem
and the dependence on initial conditions is still an interesting question.7

The theory for the linear stage for incompressible ﬂuids agrees well with the experiments.2,8 In the absence of
surface tension and viscosity, the growth rate increases indeﬁnitely with the wavenumber. This trend is changed
by the presence of viscosity, in which case the growth rate has a peak value and decreases towards zero for large
wavenumbers. On the other hand, the presence of surface tension stabilizes perturbations with the wavenumber
larger than a critical value.

The role of compressibility on the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability between inviscid ﬂuids has been
studied by several authors,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 however its eﬀect compared with the incompressible case is still under
debate. The earlier studies of the linear stage dealing with ideal ﬂuids9,10 introduced simplifying assumptions and
are strictly valid only when γ = 1. Bernstein and Book12 and Turner16 removed these assumptions and studied the
eﬀects of compressibility as a function of γ. They found that these eﬀects are more important at small wavenumbers
and the rate of growth increases as γ decreases. They concluded that compressibility has a destabilizing eﬀect. The
same conclusion is obtained for a multilayer system by Yang and Zhang14 by comparing the compressible growth
rate with that corresponding to an incompressible system obtained as γ → ∞. The increase in the growth rate as γ
decreases can also be explained using the energy principle, as a special case of the comparison theorem in the calculus
of variations.18

On the other hand, Sharp7 ﬁnds a stabilizing eﬀect of compressibility. Moreover, numerical results for late time
growth seem to indicate that α (the constant of proportionality in the quadratic law for the rate of growth) increases
with the speed of sound,17 so that compressibility would have a stabilizing eﬀect. Baker11 found both stabilizing
and destabilizing eﬀects of compressibility in the linear regime, however his results were based on previously derived

formulas using diﬀerent assumptions than ideal gas. The role of compressibility on the instability growth is thus not
yet settled. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge no study of the eﬀects of compressibility in the linear regime
for viscous ﬂuids has been performed. Additionally, there is no systematic study of the eﬀects of surface tension and
ﬁnite size domain in the compressible case.

In this paper we resolve the apparent contradiction between the stabilizing and destabilizing character of com-
pressibility for ideal ﬂuids. We show that compressibility can be characterized by two parameters, γ and the speed of
sound, with opposing inﬂuence on the instability growth. Moreover, as γ or the speed of sound (varied by changing the
equilibrium pressure p∞ at the interface while keeping the interface equilibrium density constant) increase to ∞, the
limiting incompressible ﬂows (and the bases of comparison) are diﬀerent. The compressible growth rate is bounded by
the growth rates obtained for these two incompressible ﬂows which have exponentially varying and constant density,
respectively.

A physical explanation for the decrease in the growth rate as p∞ decreases can be formulated based on the inﬂuence
of p∞ on the local Atwood number. As the interface develops, the heavier ﬂuid reaches regions of larger and larger
densities of the lighter ﬂuid while the lighter ﬂuid reaches regions of smaller densities of the heavier ﬂuid. The local
Atwood number in these regions away from the initial position of the interface depends on p∞, since the equilibrium
density proﬁle depends on p∞. Using the equilibrium density provided below, it can be shown that the local Atwood
number is lower for the points on the interface above the initial position, while it is higher below, compared to a
system at higher p∞ (less compressible). However, the decrease in p∞ leads to a larger change in the local Atwood
number above the initial position of the interface. The overall eﬀect would be a decrease in the average Atwood
number, thus oﬀering an intuitive argument for the decrease of the growth rate with decreasing p∞. Nevertheless this
argument might break for small domain sizes and the validity of the results for ﬁnite size domains is discussed. The
inﬂuence of surface tension and viscosity on the growth rate are also considered.

II. LINEARIZED EQUATIONS

The case of two superposed compressible ideal ﬂuids separated by an interface at x1 = 0 is considered. The ﬂuids
are subject to a constant gravitational acceleration g = (−g, 0, 0). For each ﬂuid, the motion is governed by the
continuity, momentum transport, and energy transport equations

A. “0”-order equations

The two ﬂuids are assumed initially at rest and the primary variables are written as small perturbations around

the equilibrium (“0”) state, with u ≡ 0. Then the governing equations reduce to

Moreover, the “0”th-order variables are assumed to be in steady state, so that ∂p0
∂t = 0 and T0 and p0 are continuous
across the interface. For inﬁnite domain or ﬁnite size domain in x1 direction with adiabatic walls, the energy equation
yields T0 = constant. Consequently, the equilibrium state is given by

where p∞ is the unperturbed pressure at the interface (x1 = 0) and m = 1, 2 denotes the material 1 or 2, with material
2 chosen to be above material 1.

The interface between the two ﬂuids is perturbed with an x2 and x3 dependent perturbation. The location of the
∂t = u1. Moreover, a surface tension is added at the

interface is described by the function xs(x1, x2, x3, t), with ∂xs

By examining equations 11-15 it should be noted that in the absence of heat diﬀusion, the limit of incompressible
ﬂow (∆ = 0) can be obtained either by letting γ → ∞ (as considered by the previous authors) or by letting p∞ → ∞
(note that since the equilibrium density at the interface should not be aﬀected by the change in pressure, the equation
of state implies T0 → ∞ in this case). In the latter case the equilibrium density becomes ρ0 = constant, while in

the former the exponential variation is still allowed. Therefore the incompressible limit (and the base of comparison
for the rate of growth) is diﬀerent in the two cases. In the next sections γ and p∞ are considered as independent
parameters, both aﬀecting the compressibility of the ﬂow. The inviscid, inﬁnite domain and no surface tension case
will be examined ﬁrst. Then the inﬂuence of ﬁnite size domain, surface tension and viscosity on the results obtained
will be investigated. The non-zero heat diﬀusivity case was also considered, but the results were very close to the
non-diﬀusive case and are not presented here.

In general, the linearized equations do not admit analytical solutions. However, it is possible to obtain an analytical
solution in the absence of viscosity and heat diﬀusion. Following the usual approach (e.g. Ref.2), we seek solutions
whose dependence on x2, x3, and time have the form

where k2, k3 and n are constants. For solutions having this dependence, equations 11-15 with µ = 0, λ = 0, become

In the dispersion formula for the compressible case (equation 26) the decrease in p∞ is equivalent to an increase in
M at γ constant. Thus, for the compressible case, M represents a measure of the compressibility eﬀects on the rate of
growth. On the other hand, M is proportional to the ratio between the wavelength of the initial perturbation and the
density exponential change length scale. For small values of M , this lengthscale is much larger than the wavelength
of the initial perturbation, and the rate of growth approaches the incompressible, constant density result.

Fig. 1 shows that n2 decreases as p∞ decreases. It should be noted that the same eﬀects of decreasing p∞ on the
nondimensional growth rate can be obtained either by increasing g or decreasing k, with all other parameters kept
constant. In other words, compressibility eﬀects are more important at larger values of g and lower wavenumbers,
which is supported by the numerical solutions of the dispersion relation presented in Fig. 1.

which is the same as that obtained from formula 30 for large M by Bernstein and Book12 and Turner.16 In general,
for ﬁnite values of M it can be shown12,16 that increasing the ratio of speciﬁc heats leads to a decrease in the rate
of growth, also supported by Fig. 1. However, the rate of growth has diﬀerent sensitivities to the change of γ1 and
γ2. Thus, as Fig. 1 shows, the change in the ratio of speciﬁc heats of the lower ﬂuid leads to a larger change of n.
Therefore, the rate of growth is more sensitive to the change in compressibility of the lower ﬂuid. However, as Fig. 1
indicates, these results are also sensitive to the value of the Atwood number. For large values of the Atwood number
the results obtained for the compressible cases show little sensitivity to changes in the ratios of speciﬁc heats and the
rate of growth obtained for the compressible case is close to the incompressible variable density result. Nevertheless,
at small Atwood numbers and for large M , the values of γ1 and γ2 become important in determining the rate of
growth. In addition, the relative diﬀerence between the growth rates obtained for the two limiting incompressible
ﬂows increases as the Atwood number decreases, so that compressibility eﬀects are larger at small Atwood numbers.

A.

Inﬂuence of Finite Size Domain

For the case in which the domain is bounded by rigid boundaries located at x = −l1 and x = l2, the growth
rates obtained for constant density incompressible ﬂow and incompressible ﬂow with exponentially varying density
are given by equations 28 and 29, respectively. Figure 2(a) presents the growth rate as a function of the nondimen-
sional parameter M for diﬀerent domain sizes. For domain sizes not very small compared to the wavelength of the
perturbation, the nondimensional growth rate is still bounded by n′
i and the rate of growth decreases as the
domain size decreases. However, similar to the incompressible case, the decrease in n is less signiﬁcant when L1 is
decreased. Therefore, for L1 < L2 the growth rate varies more when p∞ is changed, so it is more sensitive to the
change in compressibility.

i and n′′

For the extreme case when L2 << 1 (domain size small compared to the wavelength of the initial perturbation)
and γ1 ≈ 1 it is possible, as Fig. 2(b) shows, that the compressible growth rate becomes larger than the constant
density incompressible growth rate for M smaller than a critical value. Numerical solutions of the dispersion relation
26 for a large range of parameters indicate that the curve n2 can intersect only once the line n2 = n′2
i . Therefore, an
analytical condition for the existence of the overshoot can be found by letting M → 0 (in which case the dispersion
relation simpliﬁes considerably) and imposing n2 > n′2

i . After some algebra one obtains

where Φm = Lm coth2 Lm − coth Lm − Lm varies from 0 to −1 as Lm increases from 0 to ∞. Consistent with the
numerical results, condition 34 can be fulﬁlled only for small values of the domain size of the upper ﬂuid and ratio of
speciﬁc heats close to 1 for the lower ﬂuid.

B.

Inﬂuence of Surface Tension

The presence of surface tension tends to inhibit the growth of the instability. Moreover, for the incompressible case
there is a critical wavenumber kc = [(ρ2 −ρ1)g/T ]1/2,2 so that the arrangement is stable for k > kc. By imposing n = 0
in the dispersion relation 26 it can be seen that the critical wavenumber remains the same as in the incompressible
case. However, for Ts 6= 0, the wavenumber appears as an explicit parameter in the dispersion relation 26 so the
variations of p∞ and k are no longer equivalent. Nevertheless, at each k, the nondimensional compressible rate of
growth obtained for inﬁnite domain is still bounded by n′2
i , as Fig. 3 shows. However, the lower limit is
approached diﬀerently as γ1 or γ2 increase to ∞. Thus, the variation in the compressibility of the lower ﬂuid is more
important at lower wavenumbers, while the variation in the compressibility of the upper ﬂuid is more important at
higher wavenumbers.

IV. EFFECT OF VISCOSITY

Consider the case of two viscous ﬂuids, bounded by two rigid surfaces at x = −l1 and x = l2. Following the previous
procedure, the linearized equations can be reduced to a single fourth order ordinary diﬀerential equation in u1 of the
form

A4D4u1 + A3D3u1 + A2D2u1 + A1Du1 + A0u1 = 0,

(35)

where the coeﬃcients Ai are given in the Appendix for the compressible case and the two incompressible limiting cases.
However, only for the uniform density incompressible case this equation has constant coeﬃcients and an easily derived
analytical solution. The boundary conditions for equation 35 are ui = 0 at x = −l1 and x = l2, ui and tangential
viscous stresses continuous at the interface, and a jump condition found from the integration of the governing equation
over the interface. For the compressible case, the condition that tangential velocities vanish at the rigid boundary
can be written as ∆ − Du1 = 0 at x = −l1 and x = l2, while the continuity of u2 and u3 at the interface leads to the
continuity of ∆ − Du1. The divergence of the velocity ﬂuctuations is given by

∆ = B3D3u1 + B2D2u1 + B1Du1 + B0u1,

with the coeﬃcients Bi given in the Appendix. The continuity of the tangential viscous stress over the interface can
be written as

δ(µ[D∆ − D2u1 − k2u1]) = 0.

An expression for D∆ in terms of the derivatives of u1 is provided in the Appendix. The jump condition at the
interface can be found by eliminating p, u2, and u3 from the momentum equation and integrating the resulting
equation over an inﬁnitesimal element of x1 which includes the interface

(38)

For ∆ = 0 condition 38 reduces to the condition derived for the incompressible case in Ref.2 In the Appendix an
expression for D2∆ is provided. Since u1 can be found only to a multiplying constant, the boundary conditions are
supplemented with the speciﬁcation of u1 or one of its derivatives at one point inside the domain. Then equation 35
together with the boundary conditions described above form a closed set of equations from which u1 on each side of
the interface and the rate of growth n can be determined. For all cases considered l1 and l2 are large compared to

8

the wavelength of the initial perturbation so the conﬁguration is close to the inﬁnite domain case. Equation 35 was
integrated on each side of the domain using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme. In order to determine n and u1 from
the matching conditions at the interface, a multidimensional secant method (Broyden’s method) was employed.

Figure 4 presents numerical solutions of the viscous linearized equations for diﬀerent Atwood numbers. Consistent
with the previous results, the compressible rate of growth is bounded by the incompressible rates of growth obtained
for uniform density and exponentially varying density cases. Moreover, its behavior is similar to the well known
incompressible constant density result. It has a peak at some critical wavenumber and decreases towards zero as the
wavenumber becomes large. However, the location of the peak is diﬀerent compared to the incompressible case, with
the highest diﬀerence at small Atwood numbers. Here we should note a qualitative diﬀerence between the results
obtained for the constant density incompressible case and those obtained for the compressible and variable density
incompressible cases. At small Atwood numbers, the critical wavenumber decreases with Atwood number for the
constant density incompressible case, while it increases for the other two cases. Moreover, as shown in the previous
sections, the largest diﬀerences in the inviscid rate of growth compared to the constant density incompressible case
are obtained at small wavenumbers and small Atwood numbers. It is expected then that, for the viscous case at small
Atwood numbers, the relative diﬀerence between the rate of growth obtained for the compressible and incompressible
cases considered will be largest, also conﬁrmed by Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). Although this diﬀerence should become very
small as M approaches zero, Fig. 4(b) shows that, for small Atwood numbers, it persists at smaller values of M .

V. CONCLUSIONS

The eﬀects of compressibility on the growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor instability between two immiscible ideal ﬂuids
are examined in the linear regime. The results distinguish between the stabilizing and destabilizing character of
compressibility. For inﬁnite domains, the growth rate n obtained for the compressible case is bounded by the growth
rates obtained for the corresponding incompressible ﬂows with constant and exponentially varying density, and this
result is not aﬀected by the presence of surface tension or viscosity. For ideal gases with zero heat diﬀusivity, the
limiting incompressible ﬂow (deﬁned by ∂ui/∂xi = 0) can be attained either by increasing the ratio of speciﬁc heats,
γ, or the speed of sound (varied by changing the equilibrium pressure at the interface at constant equilibrium density
at the interface). The equilibrium density distribution for the limiting incompressible ﬂow is diﬀerent in the two cases.
Moreover, the two parameters have opposing inﬂuence on the rate of growth. As the speed of sound is increased, the
rate of growth increases towards the value obtained for the corresponding constant density incompressible ﬂow, while
as γ increases, n decreases towards the value obtained for the corresponding incompressible ﬂow with exponentially
varying density. The presence of heat diﬀusion was also considered, but the results were very close to those obtained
for the nondiﬀusive case and were not presented here.

The equilibrium density for a compressible ﬂow varies exponentially with x1 and depends on p∞. Therefore, the
local Atwood number changes as the interface moves away from the original position. Compared to a ﬂow with a
higher value of p∞ (less compressible), the local Atwood number decreases for the points on the interface situated
above the initial position, while it increases for the points on the interface situated below the initial position. However,
the change in the local Atwood number is larger above the initial position of the interface, so that the overall eﬀect
would be a decrease of the average local Atwood number. This oﬀers an intuitive argument for the decrease of the
growth rate as p∞ decreases. Moreover, this argument suggests that the bubble velocity decreases, while the spike
velocity increases for more compressible ﬂows. On the other hand, as γ decreases the ﬂuids are more compressible,
however the equilibrium density and pressure do not change. Therefore, as the heavier ﬂuid moves towards regions
of higher pressures, its volume decreases and the volume change is larger for more compressible ﬂuids, so that the
spike velocity decreases. Similarly, for more compressible ﬂuids the bubble velocity increases. If the two ﬂuids have
diﬀerent values for γ, it is shown that the growth rate is more sensitive to the change in the ratio of the speciﬁc heats
of the lower ﬂuid. However, at large Atwood numbers the rate of growth is little inﬂuenced by the values of γ1 and
γ2 and p∞ becomes the main compressibility parameter. In addition, it is shown that compressibility eﬀects are more
important at small Atwood numbers.

For domains bounded by rigid surfaces, the compressible growth rate is still bounded by the two incompressible
growth rates described above, except for the extreme case when the domain size of the upper ﬂuid is small compared
to the wavelength of the initial perturbation and γ ≈ 1 for the lower ﬂuid. In this case, the compressible growth
rate can become larger than the growth rate obtained for the corresponding constant density incompressible ﬂow for
values of the compressibility parameter M = g(ρ1+ρ2)
smaller than a critical value. An analytical condition for the
existence of this overshoot is provided. In general, the results show that the compressible growth rate varies more
when the rigid boundary of the lower ﬂuid is closer to the interface than the rigid boundary of the upper ﬂuid, so
that it is more sensitive to the change in compressibility.

kp∞

The presence of surface tension tends to inhibit the growth rate of the instability and for the incompressible case

9

there is a critical wavenumber above which the conﬁguration becomes stable.
It is shown that the value of this
critical wavenumber is not aﬀected by compressibility. For wavenumbers below this critical value the general result
presented above remains valid. However, the presence of surface tension modiﬁes the sensitivity of the growth rate to
a diﬀerential change in the value of γ for the two ﬂuids. At smaller wavenumbers, the change in γ for the lower ﬂuid
is more important for the variation of n, while the opposite holds true at higher wavenumbers.

Numerical solutions of the linearized equations show that for viscous compressible ﬂuids, the growth rate behaves
in a manner analogous to the incompressible growth rate. It has a most unstable wavenumber and decreases towards
zero at larger wavenumbers. Moreover, both the growth rate and the most unstable mode are bounded by the
values obtained for the corresponding constant and variable density incompressible ﬂows. For the constant density
incompressible ﬂow it is known that the most unstable mode moves to small wavenumbers as the Atwood number is
decreased. The inviscid results presented in this paper show that the eﬀects of compressibility are more important
at small wavenumbers and small Atwood numbers. Consistent with these results, it is found that for viscous ﬂuids
compressibility becomes more important at small Atwood numbers. For small enough Atwood numbers, the diﬀerence
between the compressible and incompressible growth rates will remain sizable at larger values of the equilibrium
pressure.

An interesting question raised by the results presented in this paper is if they remain valid in the nonlinear regime for
single and/or multimode initial perturbation. Our preliminary numerical results seem to indicate a similar inﬂuence
of p∞ and γ on the growth rate (and on the spike and bubble velocities) to that found in the linear regime. Moreover,
even for large values of the equilibrium pressure so that the early time results are close to the incompressible ﬂow
results, the late time spike and bubble velocities become diﬀerent than in the incompressible case. Another interesting
question is about the range of the amplitudes of the perturbation for which the growth rate agrees with the linear
theory prediction. Again, our preliminary numerical results seem to indicate that the range of validity of the linear
assumption remains approximately the same as in the incompressible case. These results will be published elsewhere.
This study was concerned with the eﬀects of compressibility on the instability growth between immiscible ﬂuids
with uniform equilibrium temperature. It does not cover many of the conﬁgurations of practical interest, for example
the presence of an equilibrium temperature gradient, a more general equation of state or diﬀuse interfaces, which
might be important in certain applications.3,19 However this study oﬀers a systematic approach for examining the
eﬀects of compressibility which could represent a starting point for analyzing diﬀerent or more complex conﬁgurations.

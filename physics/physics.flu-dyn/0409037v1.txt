Abstract

Although the critical Reynolds number for linear instability of the laminar ﬂow in a straight pipe
is inﬁnite, we show that it is ﬁnite for a divergent pipe, and approaches inﬁnity as the inverse of the
divergence angle. The velocity proﬁle at the threshold of inviscid stability is obtained. A non-parallel
analysis yields linear instability at surprisingly low Reynolds numbers, of about 150 for a divergence
of 3 degrees, which would suggest a role for such instabilities in the transition to turbulence. A
multigrid Poisson equation solver is employed for the basic ﬂow, and an extended eigenvalue method
for the partial diﬀerential equations describing the stability.

Introduction

The laminar ﬂow through a straight pipe is linearly stable for any Reynolds number [(18), (7), (15)], but,
as ﬁrst demonstrated by (17), transition to turbulence usually occurs at a Reynolds number Re, based
on the pipe diameter and mean velocity, of around 2000. By reducing the external disturbances, it is
possible to maintain laminar ﬂow up to Re = 300, 000 (Sreenivasan, private communication) when the
pipe is smooth and the ﬂow at the inlet very quiet, but keeping the ﬂow laminar becomes very diﬃcult
at high Reynolds numbers, since the ﬂow is increasingly sensitive to external disturbances. Although a
few questions remain about the complete route to turbulence in a straight pipe, it is clear now that the
spectrum of linear (stable) modes has a signiﬁcant role to play via transient algebraic growth [(16; 19)]
of disturbances.

Our purpose in this paper is to examine the possible role of small local divergences in the transition
process, exploiting the fact that linear stability is described by a singular perturbation problem, and a
small deceleration/acceleration could therefore have a large eﬀect. While a large amount of work has been
done on the ﬂow in suddenly expanding goemetries, there is no work that we know of on the stability
of slowly diverging pipe ﬂows. Sudden expansions have attracted attention because of the recirculation
zone so generated, its length as a function of the Reynolds number [(5; 10)], the oscillations of the
recirculating bubble and its eﬀect on the ﬂow [(21)], etc., but our focus is diﬀerent, as will become
immediately apparent. A slow divergence in the case of a two-dimensional channel was studied a long
time ago by (8) and (9), who analysed the Jeﬀery-Hamel ﬂow generated by a wedge-shaped channel,
and showed by linear parallel stability analysis (the Orr-Sommerfeld equation) that the critical Reynolds
number decreases by a large amount even for a small divergence angle. The divergent pipe is more
interesting for several reasons: the critical Reynolds number is inﬁnite for an angle of divergence of zero,
the Reynolds number is a decreasing function of the streamwise (axial) coordinate x, which gives scope
for relaminarisation of turbulent ﬂow, and the ﬂow non-parallelism is larger for a given divergence. In
the present work, we employ a two-pronged approach. For the mean ﬂow, we derive an axisymmetric
Jeﬀery-Hamel equation (AJH), which is valid at small divergence angles. At larger angles of divergence
(1o or greater) we solve the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes directly in the geometry shown in ﬁgure 1, with
a divergent portion of ﬁnite extent. At small angles of divergence and high Reynolds numbers (above

1

1000), a parallel ﬂow stability analysis is conducted on the AJH proﬁle, while at lower Reynolds numbers,
the partial diﬀerential equations for non-parallel stability are solved as an extended eigenvalue problem.

Our main results may be summarised as follows. At low levels of divergence, linear stability in determined
by a parameter S(x), deﬁned as the product of Re and the slope a of the wall. The ﬂow is unstable to the
swirl mode for S > 10, so the critical Reynolds number approaches inﬁnity inversely as the divergence
angle goes to zero. At divergences greater then 1o, non-parallel eﬀects are found to be quite large, and a
full analysis shows that the ﬂow in a geometry containing a 3o divergence is linearly unstable to the swirl
mode at Reynolds numbers as low as 150. The growth of disturbances depends on the distance from the
centreline, also one ﬂow quantity can grow while others decay.

The following two sections describe the basic ﬂow computations and the stability analysis respectively.

2 The basic ﬂow

2.1 Axisymmetric Jeﬀery-Hamel equation

We begin by noting that unlike in a divergent two-dimensional channel, no similarity ﬂow is possible in a
divergent pipe. At very low angles of divergence, however, it is possible to derive a one-parameter family
of velocity proﬁles, where the parameter

varies slowly in x. We consider a pipe whose radius R is slowly changing with x, such that the slope of
the wall, given by

S ≡ aRe

a ≡

dR(xd)
dxd

is small. The subscript d stands for a dimensional quantity. The axial and radial velocities, Ud and Vd
respectively, may be written in terms of a generalised streamfunction Ψd as

Ud =

rd

∂Ψd

Vd = −

where r is the radial coordinate. The momentum equations are non-dimensionalised using the local radius
R(xd) and the centreline velocity Uc(xd) as scales, e.g., Ψd = UcR2Ψ. In particular, the axial coordinate
is scaled using

(4)
dxd = Rdx.
The Reynolds number is assumed to be high and the divergence small enough, so that all terms of O(Re−2)
or O(a−2) and higher are negligible. Upon eliminating the pressure from the momentum equations, and
neglecting higher order terms, we obtain

2.2 Numerical solution

The geometry studied here is as shown in the schematic in ﬁgure 1, with a straight pipe at the entry,
followed by an axisymmetric divergent portion, which in turn is followed by a long straight exit portion.
The length and velocity scales, redeﬁned for convenience in this subsection alone, respectively are the
radius Ri and the centerline velocity Ui at the inlet. In the case presented here, the divergent portion
starts at x = 9.4 and ends at x = 91 with a 3o angle of divergence. The total length of the domain is
L = 120. The axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for steady, incompressible, Newtonian ﬂow in the
streamfunction vorticity formulation, in non-dimensional form, are given by

∇

Ω,

(7)

Ω = −∇2Ψ,
(8)
where Rei ≡ UiRi/ν, Ω(x, r) is the azimuthal vorticity, ~U is the velocity vector, and t is time. The
boundary conditions at the centerline are Ψ = Ω = V = ∂U/∂r = 0. No-slip and impermeable boundary
conditions are imposed at the wall. The functional forms of the streamfunction at the centerline, and
the vorticity at the wall, are described by employing ﬁctitious points outside the domain. At the inlet, a
parabolic velocity proﬁle is prescribed, while at the outlet the Neumann boundary conditions: ∂Ψ/∂x = 0,
and ∂Ω/∂x = 0 are imposed. The reason for using a long exit section, and the consequent increase in
computational eﬀort, is due to the requirement that the Neumann condition be valid at the exit.

A transformation of coordinates, given by ζ = x, r = rd/R(x), is adopted. We begin with a guess
solution, where the velocity proﬁle is parabolic at every axial location, and march in psuedo-time until a
steady-state solution is obtained. The vorticity distribution at each new time step is calculated from (7),
adopting a ﬁrst-order accurate forward diﬀerencing in time and second-order accurate central diﬀerencing
in space, on a 34X258 grid. The vorticity distribution thus computed is used to solve the Poisson equation
(8) to obtain the streamfunction everywhere. A Jacobi iterative scheme is used. The elliptic nature of
this equation renders this step the most time-consuming, and the adoption of an acceleration method
necessary, even though the ﬂow is laminar and axisymmetric. A six level full-multigrid technique (FMG)
[(11; 12)] with a simple V-cycle algorithm is used for this purpose. The basic principle is to rapidly
reduce error components of diﬀerent (long) wavelenghts by coarse-graining. (The Jacobi method on its
own can act only locally during a given iteration, and is therefore only eﬃcient in reducing the component
of error of the shortest wavelength.) The convergence rate obtained by an FMG is compared to that
without any acceleration method in ﬁgure 2(a), the usual increase in convergence displayed by such
algorithms is observed. The velocity components are then calculated from the streamfunction, and the
procedure is repeated until the vorticity residual
reduces to a value
(cid:16)
below a prescribed limit, = 10−10 in the present case (ﬁgure 2b). Here i and j are the axial and radial
coordinates of the grid points respectively, I and J are the number of grid points in the axial and radial
directions respectively, N stands for the present, and (N − 1) for the previous, time-step. The axial and
radial velocity proﬁles for Re = 150 at diﬀerent downstream locations are compared with those from the
AJH proﬁles in ﬁgure 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. It is seen that the AJF proﬁle at x = 22.9 underpredicts
the eﬀect of divergence but at x = 46.4 overpredicts this eﬀect. At Reynolds numbers below 50 and
angles of divergence below 1o, however, we ﬁnd that the AJH gives a fairly good approximation of the
actual proﬁle (not shown).

dentally, at higher divergence, regions of separation are obtained to very good accuracy by the present
method, but are not the subject of discussion here. To the contrary, our interest is in ﬁnding the smallest
divergence at which ﬂow behaviour is completely diﬀerent from that in a straight pipe.

3 Non-parallel stability analysis

We now revert to the use of the local radius R(x) and the local centerline velocity Uc(x) at a given x as
scales. Each ﬂow quantity is expressed as the sum of a steady mean and a time-dependent perturbation,
such as

u = U (x, r) + ˆu(x, r, θ, t).

(9)

Since the ﬂow under consideration varies signiﬁcantly in the axial direction, a normal mode form may
be used only in time and in the azimuthal coordinate θ. In the axial coordinate, the perturbation may
be expressed as a rapidly varying wave-like part scaled by a relatively slowly varying function [see e.g.
(2; 14)], such as

[ˆu, ˆv, ˆw, ˆp] = Real

[u(x, r), v(x, r), w(x, r), p(x, r)] exp

where ˆu, ˆv and ˆw are the axial, radial and the azimuthal velocity perturbations respectively, ˆp is the
pressure perturbation, α(x) is a local axial wavenumber, n is the number of waves in the azimuthal
direction, and β is the disturbance frequency. The equations are linearised in the standard manner, and

terms of higher order [O(a2), O(Re−2), O(Re−1a)] are neglected. The result is a set of partial diﬀerential
equations for the perturbation velocities and pressure, each of ﬁrst order in x and up to second order in
r, which amounts to a seventh order system in r. These may be expressed in the form

Here U ′

c = dUc/dx.

In equation (11), we conﬁrm that if we set a, U ′
c and ∂φ/∂x to zero, we get the parallel stability equations
of (13) and (15). The boundary conditions emerge from requiring that all quantities vary continuously
with r at the centerline [(1)], and obey no-slip at the wall:

u = v = w = p = 0,
v + ıw = 0,

u = p = 0,

at r = 0, for n 6= 1,
at r = 0, for n = 1,

u = v = w = 0,

at r = 1.

Note that for n = 1, we have only six boundary conditions for a seventh order system. We therefore
generate an extra boundary condition by diﬀerentiating the continuity equation with respect to r, and
using the fact that u(x, 0) = 0, to get

This problem may be solved as an eigenvaule problem of larger size [Balachandar & Govindarajan,
preprint, 2004] as described below. The streamwise derivative in equation (11) couples neighboring axial
locations in the ﬂow-ﬁeld to one another. Consider two streamwise locations 1 and 2 separated by an
incremental distance, i.e., x2 = x1 + ∆x. We may write

Since the dimensional freqency βd remains constant, β1 and β2 are related as follows

(Higher-order approximations to the streamwise derivative could be considered instead of (16) and the
resulting eigensystem would be of correspondingly large size.) Equation (18) is solved by a spectral
collocation method [(4)]. The eigenvalue β1 is obtained as a complex quantity, the complex streamwise
wavenumber is iterated until β1 assumes the desired real value (= βdR/Uc) at a given x1. The axial
variation of the wavenumber, dα/dx, and the initial guess for α1 are obtained by solving the homogeneous
part of the equation (11). In subsequent iterations, dα/dx is maintained constant, since the correction due
to the inhomogeneous terms on this quantity is of higher order. It is to be noted that the apportionment
in (10) between the x-dependences of α and the eigenfunction is arbitrary. There are many ways of
performing this apportionment, [(2)], and so long as the rapid (wavelike) change is included in αr, there
is no diﬀerence in the prediction of the growth of any physical quantity. We have checked that this is the
case for the present ﬂow as well. Choosing dα/dx from the homogeneous part of the equation is one way
of including the rapid change into α(x), leaving a relatively slow change in u(x).

We consider downstream growth of disturbances followed at a constant value of the non-dimensional
radius r. The amplitude of a given disturbance a particular streamwise location is given by

We see that a disturbance may amplify at one r and decay at another. Secondly, one component of the
velocity could be amplifying while the others are decaying.

4 Results and discussion

The slowest decaying mode in a straight pipe is the swirl mode (of azimuthal wave number n = 1) [(3; 6)].
In the diverging pipe, we ﬁnd that this mode again is always the most unstable, all results presented
here are for n = 1. We emphasise that a non-parallel stability analysis is necessary: with a parallel ﬂow
assumption, there is no instability until a Reynolds number of about 1000.

We ﬁrst compare our eigenspectrum for the ﬂow through a straight pipe with that of (20). Every
eigenvalue matches up to the 10th decimal place. Next we study the eﬀect of very small divergence on the
stability behaviour by conducting a parallel ﬂow stability analysis (neglecting non-parallel terms in the
stability equation) on the AJH proﬁles. For these parameters, the results have been checked to be the
same as those from a full non-parallel analysis. Figure 4(a) shows the critical Reynolds number for linear
instability as a function of the angle of divergence. At small (but non-zero) divergence angle, we ﬁnd a
ﬁnite Reynolds number for linear instability. It can be seen that a power-law relationship is obeyed, with
the critical Reynolds number varying as the inverse of the divergence angle. The reason for an inverse
relationship may be elicited from the expectation that an inviscid mechanism would be operational at
very high Reynolds numbers, and from the fact that the AJH velocity proﬁles (6) are described by a one
parameter family. Our results show that there is a limiting velocity proﬁle corresponding to S = 10, and
ﬂows where S is greater than 10 are linearly unstable.

To understand this behaviour better, we write down the equation for inviscid stability (the axisymmetric
Rayleigh equation), by neglecting terms containing Re−1 and a in (11), setting n = 1, and eliminating
w, p and u in turn to get

As r → ∞, the above equation, as it should, reduces to the two-dimensional Rayleigh equation. In two-
dimensional ﬂow, Rayleigh showed that a necessary condition for instability is that U ′′ goes through a zero
somewhere in the ﬂow [(20)]. Several improvements on this criterion have been made for two-dimensional
ﬂow, but there is no proof, as far as we know, of a corresponding necessary condition for pipe ﬂow. We
may however follow a heuristic approach, and noting that the quantity I ≡ U ′′ −(α2r2 −1)/r/(1+α2r2)U ′
corresponds to the U ′′ of two-dimensional ﬂow, we proceed to check under what conditions this quantity
changes sign within the ﬂow. Figure 4(b) shows the variation of I with the radial coordinate, I undergoes
a sign change if S > 2. A value of α = 1.26, corresponding to critical instability, has been used.

We now examine the behaviour at higher levels of divergence. For the geometry shown in the ﬁgure 1,
results from a full non-parallel spatial stability analysis are presented for Re = 150 based on the radius and
centerline velocity at the inlet. The growth rate, as mentioned before, depends on how far the monitoring
location is from the centerline, and what is the quantity being monitored. An examination of equation
(20) shows that the second and third terms on the right hand side determine the r-dependence, while
the second term comes from the ﬂow quantity under consideration. Typical plots of the eigenfunctions

u, v and w, and their axial variations, are shown in ﬁgures 5(a) and (b) respectively. For the particular
disturbance frequency and axial location corresponding to this ﬁgure, it is seen that v always decreases
with x, so the second term in (20) has a stabilising eﬀect on v. Closer to the centerline, the growth rate
of u is higher than that of w, while at intermediate r the reverse is true. These trends are demonstrated
in the ampliﬁcation of ˆud, ˆvd and ˆwd, as shown in ﬁgures 6, 7 and 8.

The Reynolds number is a decreasing function of the axial distance, beyond x ∼ 50 we ﬁnd no disturbance
that has a positive growth rate. At higher Reynolds numbers, there is scope for turbulent ﬂow in
the initial portion of the divergent section, and relaminarisation downstream. These aspects are being

explored experimentally by Sood et al. and will be reported separately. The sensitivity to small levels of
divergence may have implications for small scale ﬂows.

In summary, the critical Reynolds number for linear instability is ﬁnite, and can be surprisingly low, with
signiﬁcant disturbance growth rates, even for small angles of divergence, a full non-parallel analysis is
essential. The consequent likelihood of a diﬀerent route to turbulence from that in a straight pipe needs
to be explored. As the divergence angle goes to zero, the critical Reynolds number approaches inﬁnity
inversely as the divergence angle, the mechanism here is inviscid.

Grateful thanks are due to Ajay Sood and Narayanan Menon for useful discussions. We thank the Defence
R&D Organisation, Government of India for ﬁnancial support.

Hydraulic jumps created by gravity are seen every day in the kitchen sink. We show that at small
scales a circular hydraulic jump can be created in the absence of gravity, by surface tension. The
theory is motivated by our experimental ﬁnding of a height discontinuity in spreading submicron
molten metal droplets created by pulsed-laser ablation. By careful control of initial conditions, we
show that this leads to solid femtolitre cups of gold, silver, copper, niobium and tin.

It has long been observed that water ﬂowing hori-
zontally can display a discontinuity in height [1, 2, 3].
This is the hydraulic jump, seen for example when wa-
ter from a faucet impinges on the kitchen sink and
spreads outwards. Gravity is a key ingredient in these
well-understood large-scale hydraulic jumps, as discussed
brieﬂy below.
In this Letter we show, remarkably,
that the shallow water equations support solutions for
a gravity-free hydraulic jump. The driver here is sur-
face tension at the liquid-air (or liquid-vacuum) inter-
face, and jumps may be expected to occur when relevant
length scales are submicron. Our theoretical study was
prompted by careful experiments showing that molten
metal droplets impinging on a solid substrate display
such a jump, solidifying into cup-shaped containers of
femtolitre capacity. The droplets are created by laser-
ablation of a solid metal target. Femtocups made of
diﬀerent metals on various substrates are formed under
carefully maintained conditions of laser energy and sub-
strate temperature. Outside this narrow range of pa-
rameters we ﬁnd what one would normally expect: the
droplets solidify into lump-shaped structures on the sub-
strate. The ability to make, and subsequently leach out,
femtocups at will has potential applications ranging from
nanoscale synthetic chemistry to single cell biology.

Before describing the experiments and the femtocups,
we discuss what causes a gravity-free hydraulic jump.
Consider a steady axisymmetric jet of ﬂuid of radius a
impinging on a solid plate placed normal to the ﬂow.
The density of the surrounding medium is assumed to
be negligible. The ﬂuid then spreads radially outwards
within a relatively thin ﬁlm. The dynamics within the
ﬁlm is described by the axisymmetric shallow-water equa-
tion [4, 5, 6]

where r and z are the radial coordinate and the coor-
dinate perpendicular to the solid wall respectively, with
origin on the solid surface at the centre of the imping-
ing jet. The respective velocity components are u and
w. The total height h of the ﬂuid above the surface is

a function of r, and a prime thus denotes a derivative
with respect to r. The parameters in the problem are
the acceleration due to gravity, g, the surface tension co-
eﬃcient, σ for the liquid-air or liquid vacuum interface,
and the density ρ and the kinematic viscosity ν of the
impinging ﬂuid. For incompressible axisymmetric ﬂow
the equation of continuity, in diﬀerential and in global
form, reads

where Q = πa2uj is the steady inlet volumetric ﬂow rate.
A characteristic inlet jet velocity uj is thus deﬁned. It is
reasonable to assume [3] a parabolic shape in z for the
radial velocity

u(r, z) = ζ(r)(z2 − 2h(r)z)

(3)

satisfying the no-slip condition at the wall (z = 0) and
the zero shear stress condition at the free surface (z = h).
The analysis does not hinge on this assumption; any
reasonable proﬁle shape will give qualitatively the same
results. Using Eq.
(2) and the kinematic condition
w =Dh/Dt = uh′ at z = h, the momentum equation (1)
integrated over z from 0 to h reduces after some algebra
to

where all lengths are scaled by a, and the O(1) positive
constant b = 2/5 for a parabolic proﬁle. The left-hand
side of (4) represents inertia, and the three terms on the
right hand side appear due to viscosity, gravity and sur-
face tension respectively. The relative importance of the
inertial term to each of these is quantiﬁed respectively
by the Reynolds number R ≡ uja/ν R, the Froude num-
ber F ≡ u2
j a/σ.
In large-scale ﬂows surface tension has been shown [5]
only to make a small correction to the location of the
jump, so the last term is unimportant. This is to be ex-
pected, since F in the kitchen sink is of order unity, while

j /(ga), and the Weber number W ≡ ρu2

W ∼ 10 − 100. In contrast, consider uj ∼ 10 m/s and
a ∼ 10−7m, so F ∼ 108 and W ∼ 10−2. Here surface
tension determines whether and where a jump will oc-
cur, whereas it is the gravity term that may be dropped
entirely from the equation.

In general, a jump occurs if the pressure gradient be-
comes increasingly adverse as the ﬂow proceeds down-
stream, and attains a magnitude large enough to counter
the relevant inertial eﬀects. The adverse pressure gra-
dient may be created by gravity, or surface tension, or
both. With gravity alone, Eq. (4) reduces to

h′ =

2r/R − bh/r
b − h3r2/F

.

It is seen that if F is ﬁnite and h3r2 is an increasing
function of r, the denominator will go to zero at some r,
i.e., a jump will occur in the framework of the shallow-
water equations [1, 2, 4, 5]. However, its precise location
may not coincide with this estimate [4], and in a given
experiment the radial extent available may be too small,
or the inertia too low, for a jump to occur. Decreasing
gravity has been shown to shift the jump location down-
stream [10], consistent with Eq. (5). Now considering
surface tension alone, a crude prediction of the existence
of a jump may be made by assuming the height upstream
to be slowly varying in r, i.e., h′ << 1, and thus setting
h′′ = h′′′ = 0. We may then rewrite Eq. (4) as

h′ ≃ 2r/R − bh/r
b − h3/W

.

(6)

A jump is now possible if h is an increasing function of r,
which is a more stringent requirement than in the case of
gravity. Note that the second term in the denominator
appears due to radial spreading, i.e., surface tension alone
cannot give rise to a one-dimensional jump like a tidal
bore.

We now solve Eq. (4) as an initial value problem be-
ginning at some location ri and marching downstream. A
fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is used. An initial
radius ri somewhat larger than a is chosen, where it is as-
sumed that a parabolic proﬁle has been attained. The ini-
tial conditions in h and its derivatives are not known ex-
actly for this complicated problem, and numerical studies
are being done to understand the ﬂow in this vicinity. We
have, however, repeated the computations with a variety
of initial height proﬁles, and a range 1.2 < ri < 5 and
0.1 < h < 1, and the results do not change qualitatively.
Typical solutions are shown in ﬁgure 1. At a particu-
lar radial location r = rj, there is a singularity in the
height of the ﬂuid layer. Note that as we approach rj the
shallow water equations are no longer valid, even approx-
imately, so the present analysis cannot tell us anything
about the actual shape close to or after the jump. The
dependence of the jump location on the inlet jet veloc-
ity uj is not monotonic, as seen from ﬁgure 2a. Here
the Reynolds number R is varied by changing uj, with
other quantities as in ﬁgure 1, so the Weber number in-
creases as R2, from 3 × 10−9 to 90. For very low R or

as observed in the experiment described below. (b) Contour

very high W , jumps are unlikely to form within the avail-
able radius, i.e., inertia and surface tension must be in
the right balance. The Reynolds and Weber numbers are
now varied independent of each other (ﬁgure 2b). In the
region shown in red rj > 60 so jumps are not predicted.
(A higher cut-oﬀ does not change answers qualitatively.)
Blue color indicates rj ∼ ri, this region merits numeri-
cal investigation. Gravity-free hydraulic jumps may be
expected in the region shown by intermediate color, seen
as a relatively narrow linear patch when R < 100. Here
the jump location depends only on the ratio W/R. For
a given W , jumps exist for over an order of magnitude
variation in R. At R > 100, undular jumps are seen,
which are being investigated further.

We turn now to our experiments, which show a height
discontinuity in spreading drops of molten metal. Since
the experimental ﬂow is transient in nature, a detailed
comparison with the theoretical results is not possible,
but the jump radius is in the right range. At larger
scales hydraulic jumps are known to occur even when
the incoming ﬂow is in droplets rather than jets [11].

energy Ep on a rotating metal disc in a vacuum cham-
ber (10−7 torr) and the resultant plume received at a
distance of 4 cm on a clean vertical substrate held at
a temperature Ts, for a duration of 20 min [7]. The
resulting metallic structures on the substrate are stud-
ied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDAX). Over most of the range of Ep and Ts, we ex-
pect, and obtain, ill-shaped blobs of solidiﬁed metals, see
ﬁgure 3. However, for a small range of these parameters,
there is a strong preference to form cup-like structures
of outer diameters ∼ 300nm to 10µm, with side walls
∼ 100nm high, and capacity ∼ 1 fL (ﬁg. 4). The jump
diameter is usually about half the total diameter. Height
proﬁles associated with atomic force micrographs (ﬁgure
4b) as well as EDAX spectra (not shown) [7] conﬁrm that
the central region is raised from the substrate and con-
tains metal. Interestingly, pulsed-laser ablation has been
used extensively to produce a variety of structures [8],
but femtocups have not been reported before, although
we notice stray instances of similar structures in other
studies [9].

This surprising femtocup structure is consistent with
the proposed dynamics: of a droplet spreading out thinly
initially and then undergoing a height discontinuity. We
obtain femtocups of gold, silver, copper, tin and nio-
bium of repeatable statistics on glass, silicon and graphite

(HOPG), see examples in ﬁgure 5a and b, and later in
ﬁgure 7. The solid surface being vertical and the length
scales small mean that the eﬀect of gravity is negligible.
Inertia on the other hand is considerable, since velocities
are high. We do not have a direct estimate of uj, but we
may estimate it from earlier measurements in many sim-
ilar experiments [12] to range between 1m/s to 100 m/s.
Also, the range of R and W over which a surface-tension
driven hydraulic jump occurs translates to a particular
range of Ep, since laser ﬂuence determines scales and
speeds in the incoming jet, compare ﬁgures 4a and 5c.
While the substrate is hotter than the metal’s melting
point Tm, the cup may form initially but cannot solidify
and liquid ﬂows back into the cup, so the ﬁnal object
is as seen in the inset of ﬁgure 5d. With Ts far below
Tm the tendency to form cups is much reduced (ﬁgure
5d, probably because solidiﬁcation is too rapid for ﬂow
to be completed. Optimal conditions are thus Ep (∼ 100
mJ/pulse for silver) and Ts close to but below Tm. Out-
side the correct range, blobs form rather than cups.

That the jump is directly related to droplet dynamics
is conﬁrmed by varying the substrate orientation with
respect to the incoming jet (see schematic in Fig. 6). As
θ, the inclination of the substrate away from the normal,
is increased, the structures become increasingly elliptical,
especially beyond 40◦, in accordance with the azimuthal
variation of R and W .

Since the experiment includes additional complexity in
the form of solidiﬁcation, we estimate relative time-scales
of jump formation tj and solidiﬁcation of a droplet tc. For
the experimental values of substrate thickness, tc ranges
from ∼ 3 × 10−4s on silicon to ∼ 10−2s on glass (taking
into consideration conduction, radiation and latent heat),
while tj ∼ rj/uj ∼ 10−6s or less. Contact-line freez-
ing can give rise to an increase in height in the vicinity,
typically amounting to a small percentage of the height

4

at the contact line [13]. We do notice a dependence on
the substrate of the size distribution of femtocups (ﬁg-
ure 7) and also some visual diﬀerences in the shape of
the femtocup. Our ongoing numerical study, including a
non-uniform temperature proﬁle and its eﬀects, is there-
fore aimed at a better representation of the experiments.
Also being addressed are the experimental ﬁnding of ra-
dial striations in the femtocups under certain conditions,
and the theoretical ﬁnding of undular hydraulic jumps
(similar to [14] in other conditions) when R is greater
than about 25/W (ﬁgure 8).

In summary, for the ﬁrst time, a hydraulic jump solely
driven by surface tension is shown to occur. Experimen-
tally we show evidence for such jumps in submicron high
inertia droplets of molten metals spreading radially out-
wards on a substrate. The detailed shape in the vicinity
of the jump and the transient problem including the so-
lidiﬁcation process is being studied numerically.

the height at the rim is several-fold larger than that in
the central region. In spite of this, and the disparity in
time scales, we cannot rule out a role for local freezing

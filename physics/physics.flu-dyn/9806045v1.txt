Abstract

The classical Helmholtz problem is applied for modelling and numerical investi-
gation of inviscid cusp-ended separated ﬂow around circular cylinder. Two coordi-
nate systems are used: polar for initial calculations and parabolic as topologically
most suited for inﬁnite stagnation zone. Scaling by the shape of the unknown free
line renders the problem to computational domain with ﬁxed boundaries. Diﬀerence
schemes and algorithm for Laplace equation and for Bernoulli integral are devised.
A separated ﬂow with drag coeﬃcient Cx = 0 like the so called “critical” ﬂow
is obtained. The pressure distribution on the surface of cylinder and the detach-
ment point compares quantitatively very well with the predictions of the hodograph
method.

1. Introduction

In 1868 Helmholtz [11] introduces the notion of a ﬂow consisting of a potential and
stagnant zones matching at priori unknown free boundaries which are tangential discon-
tinuities and where the balance of normal stresses (the pressure) holds. Kirchhoﬀ [13]
came up with the ﬁrst solution for the ideal ﬂow around ﬂat plate when the detachment
points were known in advance. Later on in the turning of our century, Levi-Civita [14],
Villat [19] etc. developed further the hodograph method and demonstrated its application
to ﬂows around curved bodies. Satisfying an additional condition for smooth separation
(called now Brillouin-Villat condition [1, 19, 20]) Brodetsky [2] obtained by the hodo-
graph method approximate solution for the circular cylinder with a parabolic expanding
at inﬁnity shape of the stagnation zone.

In the years 40 of the present century with the computer advent it was already possible
to calculate such class of ﬂows direct at the physical plane. The ﬁrst calculations [12, 17]
gave interesting results. Along with the Brodetsky ﬂow a radically diﬀerent Helmholtz
ﬂow takes place with decreasing stagnation zone which forms at inﬁnity cusp [3]. Because
of the limitation of computers the shape of the zone was not conclusive. It appears that
the method of hodograph can also be applied to obtain such a ﬂow (see, e.g., [10]) but

1

only for the case of circular cylinder. We also found such cusp-ended stagnation zones
[5, 6, 7] by means of diﬀerence scheme and conﬁrmed by integral-method calculations
[18]. A new interesting solution for the shape of the wake behind the circular cylinder
was obtained after further modifying of the diﬀerence scheme. Preliminary results of this
study are represented in [8]. The features of the algorithm and our further investigation
will be discussed here.

2. Posing the Problem

Consider the steady inviscid ﬂow past a circle – the cross section of an inﬁnitely long
circular cylinder. The direction of the ﬂow coincides with the line θ = 0, π of the polar
coordinates and the leading stagnation point of the ﬂow is situated in the point θ = π.
Taking into account the symmetry with respect to the line θ = 0, π we consider the ﬂow
only in upper half plane.

2.1. Coordinate Systems

The gist of our approach is to make use of two diﬀerent coordinate systems: the polar
one (turning out to be ineﬀective for the case of inﬁnite stagnation zones extending far
away from the rear end of body) and the parabolic one the latter being topologically
more suited for solving Laplace equation outside inﬁnitely long stagnation zones. We
initiate the calculations in polar coordinates switching to parabolic coordinates after the
stagnation zone has fairly well developed and has become long enough.

In terms of the two coordinate systems (cylindrical and parabolic) Laplace equation

for the stream function ψ reads:

1
r

1
r2

(rψr)r +

ψθθ = 0 ,

or

1

σ2 + τ 2 (ψσσ + ψτ τ ) = 0 .

The undisturbed uniform ﬂow at inﬁnity is given by

ψ|r

→∞

≈ rU

sin θ ,

or

∞

ψ|σ

, τ

→∞

→∞

≈ στ U

.

∞

On the combined surface “body+stagnation zone” hold two conditions. The ﬁrst

condition secures that the said boundary is a stream line (say of number “zero”)

ψ(R(θ), θ) = 0, θ ∈ [0, π]

or ψ(S(τ ), τ ) = 0, τ ∈ (0, ∞) ,

(2.3)

where R(θ), S(τ ) are the shape functions of the total boundary in polar or parabolic
coordinates, respectively. Here and henceforth we use the notation Γ1 for the portion of
boundary representing the cylinder and Γ2 – for the free streamline (Fig.1).

Let θ∗ and τ ∗ be the magnitudes of the independent coordinates for which the de-
tachment of ﬂow occurs. As far as we consider only the case when the stagnation zone
is situated behind the body then the portion of Γ2 which describes the free line of the
ﬂow is deﬁned as 0 ≤ θ ≤ θ∗ or τ ≥ τ ∗, respectively. On Γ2 the shape function R(θ)
is unknown and it is to be implicitly identiﬁed from Bernoulli integral with the pressure
equal to a constant (say, pc) which is the second condition holding on the free boundary.

(2.1)

(2.2)

For the two coordinate systems one gets the following equations for shape functions R(θ)
or S(τ ):

#σ=S(τ )

(2.4)

where q is a dimensionless pressure.

At the symmetry line θ = 0, π additional conditions are added

∂ψ
∂θ

∂ψ
∂τ

= 0 , θ = 0, π

or

= 0 , τ = 0 .

(2.5)

and thus (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4) and (2.5) complete b.v.p. for stream–function ψ.

2.2. Scaled Variables

The above stated boundary value problem is very inconvenient for numerical treatment
mainly because of two reasons. The ﬁrst is that the boundary lines are not coordinate lines.
The second is that the shape function of the stagnation zone must be implicitly identiﬁed
from the additional boundary condition (2.4). Following [9] we scale the independent
variable (θ or τ ) by the shape function R(θ) or S(τ ):

η = rR−

1(θ) ,

η = σ − S(τ ).

Such a manipulation renders the original physical domain under consideration into a
region with ﬁxed boundaries, the latter being coordinate lines. In addition the Bernoulli
integral becomes an explicit equation for the shape function of the free boundary. Scaling
the independent variable proved very eﬃcient in numerical treatment of inviscid or viscous
ﬂows with free boundaries (for details see, e.g., [6]).

We treat the two coordinate systems in an uniform way denoting ξ ≡ θ or ξ ≡ τ
depending on the particular case under consideration. In terms of the new coordinates
(η, ξ), the stream function is a compound function ˜ψ(η, θ) ≡ ψ(r(η, ξ), ξ) or ˜ψ(η, τ ) ≡
ψ(σ(η, ξ), ξ) but in what follows we drop the “tilde” without fear of confusion. The
Laplace equation takes then the form

where

(aψη)η + (bψξ)ξ − (cψξ)η − (cψη)ξ = 0

Thus we deﬁne a well posed boundary value problem for ψ provided that functions
R(θ) and S(τ ) are known. On the other hand in the portion Γ2 of the boundary (where
these functions are unknown) they can be evaluated from the Bernoulli integral (2.4)
which now becomes an explicit equation for the shape function

3. Forces Exerted on the Body

The presence of a stagnation zone breaks the symmetry of the integral for the normal
stresses and hence D’Alembert paradox ceases to exist, i.e. the force exerted from the
ﬂow upon the body is no more equal to zero. Denote by n the outward normal vector to
the contour Γ. Then the force acting upon the contour is given by

4. Diﬀerence Scheme and Algorithm

4.1. Splitting scheme for Laplace equation

For the purposes of the numerical solution, the transformed domain must be reduced
to ﬁnite one after appropriately choosing the “actual inﬁnities”.
In the case of polar
coordinates the domain is inﬁnite with respect to coordinate η only and it fully enough
to select suﬃciently large number η
]
∞
(Fig.2a). In the case of parabolic coordinates an actual inﬁnity is to be speciﬁed also
for the τ -coordinate, namely τ

In both directions we employ non-uniform mesh. The ﬁrst and the last η-

lines are displaced (staggered) from the respective domain boundaries on a half of the
adjacent value of the spacing. Thus on two-point stencils second-order approximation for
the boundary conditions is achieved (see [6]. The non-uniformity of the mesh enables us
to improve the accuracy near the body and to reduce the number of points at inﬁnity.

and to consider the rectangle: [0 ≤ θ ≤ π; 1 ≤ η ≤ η

and to consider the rectangle: [0 ≤ τ ≤ τ

; 0 ≤ η ≤ η

In θ-direction the mesh is not staggered but it is once again non-uniform being very
in the vicinity of θ = 0 which is
dense in the vicinity of the rear stagnation point, i.e.
of crucial importance when acknowledging the inﬁnity in cylindrical coordinates.
It is
desirable to have the “actual inﬁnity” in cylindrical coordinates as larger as possible in
order to prepare the ground for switching to the parabolic coordinates. The connection
between the τ -mesh and θ-mesh is derived on the basis of the connections between the
two coordinate systems, namely

τ j =

R(θj) cos θj + R(θj) ,

if 0 ≤ θj ≤ π ;

Sj =

2R(θj) − τ 2
j ,

q

(4.1)

and these relations can be transformed when necessary to calculate Sj, τ j from Rj, θj or
vice versa.

Due to the topological diﬀerences between the polar and parabolic coordinate systems
after the transition to parabolic coordinates it is necessary to generate a new τ -mesh.
The new mesh has to be sparse at large distances behind the body where the gradients of
the ﬂow are small. To this end the knots τ j are obtained from (4.1) making use of spline
interpolation. The new τ -mesh is uniform on the rigid body and is changing behind the
body according to the quadratic rule





τ j = (j − 1)h ,
τ j = exp (j − [ N

, h = 3

(4.2)

where [ N

3 ] is the last point of the rigid body

We solve the boundary value problem iteratively by means of the method of splitting
of operator. Upon introducing ﬁctitious time we render the equation to parabolic type
and then employ the so-called scheme of stabilising correction [21]. On the ﬁrst half-time
step we have the following diﬀerential equations (∆t is the time increment)

ψ

1

(4.3)

for i = 2, · · · , M, j = 2, . . . , N with respective boundary conditions [6]

The second half-time step consists in solving the following diﬀerential equations

= Λ1(aΛ1ψn+1)ij − Λ1(aΛ1ψn)ij

(4.4)

for i = 2, . . . , M, j = 2, . . . , N with respective boundary conditions [6].

Thus the b.v.p. for the stream function is reduced to consequative systems with sparse
(tridiagonal) matrices (for detail see e.g.,[6]. The main advantage of the economical
schemes of the splitting type is that on each half-time step we solve one-dimensional
problems with sparse (tridiagonal) matrices. This can be done by means of the Thomas
algorithm [15]. However, the system for streamfunction ψ(η, ξ) cannot be solved by
plane Thomas algorithm since the condition for numerical stability of the elimination
is not satisﬁed for all points of domain. For this reason a modiﬁcation of the Thomas
algorithm (in fact Gaussian elimination with pivoting for three-diagonal systems) called
“non-monotonous progonka” (see [16], [4]) is employed for its solution.

To calculate afterwards the forces acting upon the body we use the simple formulas for
numerical integration based on the trapezoidal rule, which are consistent with the overall
second-order approximation of the scheme.

4.2. Diﬀerence Approximation for the Free Boundary

The equations (2.7) can be resolved for the derivatives R′(θ) or S′(τ ) when the radicals

exist, i.e. following conditions are satisﬁed:

> 1 , T (θ) =

+ R(θ) sin θ

where connection between functions T is determined simply by the formula

(4.5)

T (θ) =

(4.6)

2

The above inequalities are trivially satisﬁed in the vicinity of the leading-end stagnation
point inasmuch as that for θ → π (or τ → 0) one has T → 0 and hence R2
T 2 → ∞ or
S2+τ 2
T 2 → ∞. In the present work we use the dynamic condition (2.4) in polar coordinates
only, so that we present here just the relevant scheme in polar coordinates without going
into the details for parabolic coordinates.
Suppose that the set functions ψα

j , Sα
j are known from the previous global
iteration, say of number α.1 We check the satisfaction of (4.5) beginning from the point
θ = 0 and continue with increasing θ . Let j∗ + 1 be the last point where (4.5) is satisﬁed
and, respectively j∗ – the ﬁrst one where it is not (polar coordinates). The position θ∗ of
the detachment point is captured by means of a linear interpolation

Thus the mere condition for existence of the square root of the Bernoulli integral deﬁnes at
each iteration stage α the new approximation for the position of the detachment point so
that it ’slides’ during the iterations alongside the rigid body. This manner of determining

In the end a relaxation is used for the shape-function of the free boundary at each

global iteration according to the formula:

Rα+1 = ω ˆRj + (1 − ω)Rα

where ω is called relaxation parameter.

4.3. The general Consequence of the Algorithm

Each global iteration contains two stages. On the ﬁrst stage, the diﬀerence problem for
Laplace equation is solved iteratively either in polar or in parabolic coordinates (depending
on the development of the stagnation zone). The internal iterations (time steps with
respect to the ﬁctitious time in the splitting procedure) are conducted until convergence
6. Thus the new
is achieved in the sense that the uniform norm is lesser than ε2 = 10−
iteration for stream function ψα+1

is obtained.

ij

The polar coordinates appear to be instrumental only on the ﬁrst several (7-10) global
iterations. When the rearmost cusp point of the stagnation zone reaches 30–50 diameters
of cylinder (calibers), the current-iteration values of the sought functions are transformed
to parabolic coordinates and hence the calculations for the stream function continue solely
in terms of parabolic coordinates.

The second stage of a global iteration consists in solving the diﬀerence problem for
the free surface in polar coordinates. The transition to and from parabolic coordinates is
done according to (4.1) and (4.6). Note that there is one-to-one correspondence between
the points in polar and parabolic coordinates and hence between the respective values of
the scalar set functions ψ and R.

The criterion for convergence of the global iterations is deﬁned by the convergence of
the shape function as being the most sensitive part of the algorithm, namely the global
iterations are terminated when

5. Results and Discussion

The numerical correctness of scheme (4.3), (4.4) is veriﬁed through exhaustive numer-
ical experiments and through comparison with the known exact solution for the inviscid
non-separated ﬂow past a circular cylinder

(4.9)

(5.1)

where ψ is the stream function, U
– the velocity of the main ﬂow and r and θ - the
polar coordinates of a point of the ﬂow. We used diﬀerent meshes with sizes M × N :
41 × 68, 41 × 136, 161 × 158, 101 × 201, 101 × 136, etc. Respectively, the actual inﬁnity

numerical solution on the time increment ∆t is also investigated and it is shown that the
approximation of the stationary part of the equations (4.3) and (4.4) does not depend
on ∆t, i.e. the scheme has the property called by Yanenko [21] full approximation. The
relative diﬀerences for ψ when ∆t is in the interval [0.001,2] do not exceed 0.5%. The
numerical experiments show that the optimal values for ∆t is in interval [0.5,1]. For this
reason the rest of the calculations in the present work are performed with ∆t = 0.5. The
comparison of the solution (5.1) to the present numerical results is quantitatively very
good. The deviations for the diﬀerent meshes are in order of approximation O(h2 + g2)
and do not exceed 3%. For example in case of mesh 161 × 156 the relative error is about
0.9%.

The adequate choice of the “actual inﬁnities” η

and the spacings hi, gj have a
profound impact on the accuracy of the diﬀerence schemes (4.3) and (4.4). For a given
“actual inﬁnity” the improvement in the accuracy can be achieved through increasing the
number of mesh points (decreasing the size of spacing). This makes the use of uniform
mesh ineﬀective because in the far-ﬁeld region the gradients of the ﬂow are small and the
high resolution is not necessary. That was the reason to employ the non-uniform meshes.
The “optimal” value for the relaxation parameter turned out to be ω = 0.01. Smaller
values increased intolerable the computational time while ω > 0.1 could not ensure the
convergence of the global iterations. Respectively η
= 10 is the optimal value for the
lateral “actual inﬁnity”

In order to compare calculated results with the prescription of the Levi-Civita method
= 124.2o (in respect to leading stagnation
in case of so called ’critical’ separation angle θ
point of the cylinder) it is necessary to summarize that method and deduce corresponding
relations. Following [1] the physical plane z is mapped on the unit halfcircle t so, that free
boundary transforms into the diameter and rigid boundary - into the halfcircumference

In Figs.3-a,b are presented the obtained shapes of the stagnation zone behind the
cylinder and in the near wake for resolutions 41 × 68, 81 × 136 and 101 × 201 and dif-
ferent values of relaxation parameter: ω = 0.01; 0.001. Obviously there is an excellent
comparison between diﬀerent numerical realizations. On the same ﬁgure is added the
shape of the Chaplygin–Kolscher ﬂow. The latter we calculate by means of parametrical
equations (5.3), (5.4) using the usual trapezoidal rule. The symbols stand for the results
taken from the charts of the paper [17]. It is worth noting the perfect coincidence of the
computed by us separation angle with both this one, computed in [17] and the ’critical’
one, prescribed by the hodograph (Levi–Civita’s) method. Nevertheless the diﬀerence
between our solution and this in [17] is sizable due to the inconclusive character of the
latter. The logarithmic scale is used in Fig.3-b in order to expand the diﬀerences be-
tween the diﬀerent diﬀerence solutions making them visible in the graph. The shapes
of the free boundary obtained on the three grids with diﬀerent resolution are compared
among themselves very well up to 200 calibers . It is clearly seen up to 70 calibers the
shapes are practically indistinguishable and up to 160–170 calibers the relative diﬀerence
does not exceed 1–3% respectively. This supports the claim that indeed a solution to the
Helmholtz problem has been found numerically by means of the developed in the present
work diﬀerence scheme. At the Fig.3-b it is seen the quantitative diﬀerence between our
numerical solution of cusp-ended type and this one prescribed by the hodograph method.
Indeed there is excellent agreement concerning the positions of detachment point and
pressure distribution but the hodograph method postulates the asymptotic behaviour of
the free line also. On the contrary we do not set any condition at inﬁnity. In a sense our
free boundary has an implicit numerical “closure” of cusp-ended type.

The calculated dimensionless pressure q is shown in Fig.4. Here is seen again an
excellent comparison among the diﬀerent mesh resolutions. In the stagnation zone it is
4, which is in very good agreement with the assumption that the unknown
in order of 10−
boundary is deﬁned by the condition q = 0. The amplitude of the minimum of q is
smaller than 3 the latter being the value for ideal ﬂow without separation. This means
that the stagnation zone inﬂuences on the ﬂow upstream. On the same ﬁgure is presented
the pressure, calculated by means of (5.6) which corresponds to the separation angle
= 124.2o. Apparently obtained here pressure approximates very well this curve. It

the above assumption we made the following numerical experiment: in formula (3.2) for

6. Concluding Remarks

An algorithm for numerical solving the classical Helmholtz problem behind a circular
cylinder is developed. Scaled coordinates are employed rendering the computational do-
main into a region with ﬁxed boundaries and transforming the Bernoulli integral into an
explicit equation for the shape function. The crucial feature of the method developed here
is that the detachment point is not prescribed in advance. Rather it is deﬁned iteratively.
Diﬀerence scheme using coordinate splitting is devised. Exhaustive set of numerical ex-
periments is run and the optimal values of scheme parameters are deﬁned. Results are
veriﬁed on grids with diﬀerent resolutions. The drag coeﬃcient of the calculated separated
ﬂow vanishes like cusp-ended inﬁnite ﬂow obtained by means of the hodograph method.

We discuss some general aspects of acoustic black holes. We begin by describing the associated
formalism with which acoustic black holes are established, then we show how to model arbitrary
geometries by using a de Laval nozzle. It is argued that even though the Hawking temperature of
these black holes is too low to be detected, acoustic black holes have interesting classical properties,
some of which are outlined here, that should be explored.

INTRODUCTION

Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in
physics. The fact that they are pure objects, in the sense
that they are made from spacetime itself, explains why
they have taken such a special place in general relativity.
There is a powerful and elegant mathematical machinery
to describe them [1, 2], and their classical and quantum
properties are well understood within the general relativ-
ity framework. In this setting, the properties of isolated
black holes have been thoroughly investigated. The much
more complex processes that take part in the surround-
ings of astrophysical black holes, the interaction of black
holes with matter (accretion disks, magnetic ﬁelds, etc)
[3] or even with other black holes (for example, the prob-
lem of the head-on collision of two black holes is now
solved [4]) are more or less well understood as well. On
the semi-classical side, Hawking [5] showed that when
quantum eﬀects are taken into account, black holes are
not really black: they slowly evaporate by emitting an al-
most thermal radiation. Hawking’s prediction has been
theoretically conﬁrmed time and again in very diﬀerent
ways. The discovery of Hawking radiation uncovered a
number of fundamental questions: among them the in-
formation puzzle, the issue of the black hole ﬁnal state,
and so on. Some of these issues can be tackled only in a
more fundamental theory, because classical general rela-
tivity is not the ultimate theory of gravity since it does
not embody the principles of quantum mechanics. A con-
sistent theory of quantum gravity requires a modiﬁcation
of classical general relativity, and in the two alternative
theories more in fashion nowadays, string theory and loop
quantum gravity, black holes still occupy a special posi-
tion. String theory’s charm, for instance, derives in part
from a couple of remarkable breakthroughs in connection
with black hole physics, namely the entropy calculation

∗Electronic address: vcardoso@wugrav.wustl.edu

by a counting of micro states, and the computation of
greybody factors [6, 7, 8, 9].

The progress in understanding black holes has been
immense, over these last forty years since their concept
was born, and they now play a central role in modern
physics. Despite this, the lack of experimental tests has
always been a drawback, for general relativists, and for
people studying black holes in particular. An important
step to make black holes more accessible (from an ex-
perimental point of view) was given in 1981 by Unruh
[10], who came up with the notion of analogue black
holes. While not carrying information about Einstein’s
equations, the analogue black holes devised by Unruh do
have a very important feature that deﬁnes black holes:
the existence of an event horizon. The basic idea be-
hind these analogue acoustic black holes is very simple:
consider a ﬂuid moving with a space-dependent velocity,
for example water ﬂowing throw a variable-section tube.
Suppose the water ﬂows in the direction where the tube
gets narrower. Then the ﬂuid velocity increases down-
stream, and there will be a point where the ﬂuid velocity
exceeds the local sound velocity, in a certain frame. At
this point, in that frame, we get the equivalent of an
apparent horizon for sound waves. In fact, no (sonic) in-
formation generated downstream of this point can ever
reach upstream (for the velocity of any perturbation is
always directed downstream, as a simple velocity addi-
tion shows). This is the acoustic analogue of a black
hole, or a dumb hole. These objects share more prop-
erties with true, gravitational black holes, besides the
existence of horizons: they display geodesics, wave ef-
fects in their vicinity and, as we shall see they also emit
Hawking radiation. Nevertheless they are not true black
holes, because the acoustic metric satisﬁes the equations
of ﬂuid dynamics and not Einstein’s equations. One usu-
ally expresses this by saying that they are analogs of
general relativity, because they provide an eﬀective met-
ric and so generate the basic kinematical background in
which general relativity resides. They are not models
for general relativity, because the metric is not dynam-

ically dependent on something like Einstein’s equations
[11, 12]. Following on Unruh’s dumb hole proposal many
diﬀerent kinds of analogue black holes have been devised,
based on condensed matter physics, slow light etcetera
[11, 12, 13]. Analogue black holes have been the sub-
ject of intense study because of the Hawking radiation
they emit. In fact, it is now clear that the appearance
of Hawking radiation does not depend on the dynamics
of the Einstein equations, but only on their kinematical
structure, and more speciﬁcally on the existence of an ap-
parent horizon [12, 14]. The experimental veriﬁcation of
the Hawking eﬀect is not easy though. Unfortunately as-
trophysical black holes, having a Hawking temperature
much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic mi-
crowave background, accrete matter more eﬃciently than
they evaporate. However, since Hawking radiation cru-
cially depends on the existence of an apparent horizon,
the analogues just described do emit Hawking radiation,
and this was and still is the primary reason to study
them. At present the Hawking temperatures associated
to these analogues are too low to be detectable, but the
situation is likely to change in the near future (see for
instance [15]).

The importance of classical properties of analogue
black holes have been somewhat underestimated. First,
even though building (Hawking) very hot analogue black
holes may be extremely diﬃcult, building them any
acoustic black hole is not. Thus we can easily have an
acoustic black hole in almost any lab. What good are
these black holes for?

(i) They have an horizon. Hawking radiation is not the
only interesting thing going on when an event horizon
shows up! In particular, I would say that the “only in-
going waves at the horizon” boundary condition would be
interesting to see experimentally, with all its associated
phenomena, some of which are mentioned below.

(ii) Geodesics. This is a particularly interesting appli-
cation. As will be shown one can easily mimic several
geometries simply by varying the cross section of a de
Laval nozzle. Thus we can observe the geodesics in dif-
ferent spacetimes easily.

(iii) Measuring absorption cross-sections. This would
also be an interesting application of analogue black holes,
to measure absorption cross-sections, glory eﬀects, etc,
and compare them with theoretical predictions [16].

(iv) Superradiance. This phenomenon, involving rotat-
ing black holes [17], was in the basis for the discovery of
Hawking radiation [18]. To our knowledge this eﬀect was
never experimentally veriﬁed (not including Cherenkov
radiation in this category [19]), but it should not be very
hard to reproduce in the lab using acoustic black holes
[20, 21, 22].

(v) Quasinormal modes. The resonance modes of black
holes, called quasinormal modes (QNMs) are a very im-
portant concept in any discussion involving gravitational
radiation by black holes, the approach to equilibrium and
black hole detection [23, 24]. The QNMs of black holes
use the in-going waves at the horizon boundary condi-

2

tion, and they usually have quite an interesting spectra
of frequencies [25]. The QNMs of some analogue black
holes have already been computed [20, 21, 26].

(vi) Late-time tails. Black holes have no hair, and it
is lost at late times as a power-law falloﬀ [27]. Late-time
tails can also be studied using black hole analogues [20].
(vii) Analog black branes. It should be rather easy to
implement other analogue black objects, such as black
branes and strings, which could deepen our understand-
ing about these geometries.

(viii) Interaction of black holes with electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds. On a more speculative vein, it is even pos-
sible in principle to simulate in the lab the interaction
of astrophysical black holes with matter and with elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. It is even possible that one might be
able to study eﬀects such as the Blandford-Zjanek pro-
cess [3, 28]. This would be a tremendous motivation to
use and explore analogue black holes. Some steps along
this direction, although not directly connected to ana-
logue black holes, were given in [29].

These are just classical aspects of black holes, but even
these must be mastered before embarking on experimen-
tal Hawking radiation detection. Not only must one con-
trol what happens in the experimental situation, but the
understanding of classical phenomena may bring clues on
how to favor the probabilities to detect Hawking radia-
tion. It is also worth stressing that some purely classical
phenomena shed light on quantum aspects of (analogue
and general-relativistic) black hole physics. For exam-
ple, positive and negative norm mixing at the horizon
leads to non-trivial Bogoliubov coeﬃcients in the calcu-
lations of Hawking radiation [30]; superradiant instabili-
ties of the Kerr metric are related to the quantum process
of Schwinger pair production [31, 32, 33, 34]; and more
speculatively (classical) highly damped black hole oscil-
lations could be related to area quantization [35] (this
possibility was discarded in [20] because of the failure
to satisfy the laws of black hole mechanics [36], but the
situation may change [37]).

Most of what has been said applies equally well to other
types of analogue black holes (see for instance [12, 38]),
but for simplicity we shall here deal only with acoustic
black holes. Some aspects of acoustic black holes will be
explored: we’ll explain how to generate a large class of
acoustic black holes by using a de Laval nozzle with a
variable cross section proﬁle. We will see how to make a
simple black brane and study its stability properties. We
will then explain why in certain situation the analogue
branes are unstable [39]. We will make a small review
of what has been done so far concerning classical aspects
of wave propagation in acoustic black holes, taking the
(2 + 1)-dimensional rotating black hole as a case study.

II. EFFECTIVE ACOUSTIC GEOMETRY

This section will be as self contained as possible, be-
cause we want to make explicit the assumptions that go

with the usual derivation of the acoustic metric. How-
ever, this derivation can be found in the monograph by
Matt Visser [11]. Let us start with the equations of ﬂuid
dynamics, and try to arrange them in such a way that an
eﬀective metric stands out naturally. The fundamental
equations of ﬂuid dynamics [40, 41, 42] are the equation
of continuity

where F are for the moment all the external forces act-
ing on the ﬂuid. Hereafter we shall make the follow-
ing assumptions: (i) the external forces are all gradient-
derived, or F =
Φ. Thus we are neglecting vis-
cosity terms in Navier-Stokes equation. (ii) the ﬂuid is
locally irrotational, and introduce the velocity potential
ψ, v =
ψ; and (iii) the ﬂuid is barotropic, i.e., the
density ρ is a function of pressure p only. In this case,
we can deﬁne

To study sound waves, we follow the usual procedure
and linearize the continuity and Euler’s equations around
some background ﬂow, by setting ρ = ρ0 + ǫρ1 , p = p0 +
ǫp1 , ψ = ψ0 + ǫψ1, and discarding all terms of order ǫ2
or higher. The external potential Φ is taken as constant.
The continuity equation yields

Neither of the background quantities is assumed constant
through the ﬂow, and so they are in general dependent
on the coordinates along the ﬂow. Here we have used
the deﬁnition of the local sound speed c−2 = ∂ρ
∂p . We
can see that the propagation of sound waves in a ﬂuid is
equivalent to the propagation of a scalar ﬁeld in a generic
curved spacetime described by (15), or in covariant form
by

This means that all properties of wave propagation in
curved space hold also for the propagation of sound
waves. The power of this eﬀective geometry should be
clear: ﬁrst, by changing the background ﬂow, we change
the eﬀective acoustic metric. Second, since this geome-
try clearly has an apparent horizon at the point where
v0 = c, and since the existence of an apparent horizon
implies Hawking radiation, then there should be Hawk-
ing radiation in this geometry, which takes the form of
phonons [10]. The Hawking temperature can be com-
puted to yield [11]:

kTH =

where v⊥ is the component of the ﬂuid velocity normal

This is, for all practical purposes a number too low to
be detected, and it is even more so if one notices that
one has to deal with the ambient noise. Despite the fact
that one cannot observe Hawking radiation, one can still
measure classical aspects of black holes. So we now turn
to this, but ﬁrst we explain how we can mimic several
geometries by using a de Laval nozzle.

FIG. 1: A sketch of a de Laval nozzle, used to make a smooth
transition from subsonic to supersonic ﬂow. The velocity of
the ﬂuid v(x) equals the local velocity of sound c(x) at the
throat of the nozzle, x = xT . The cross-section at this point
is denoted by AT .

III. SHAPING THE NOZZLE

A. The de Laval nozzle

A de Laval nozzle is a device which can be used to
accelerate a ﬂuid up to supersonic velocities. They were
ﬁrst used in steam turbines, but they ﬁnd many applica-
tions in rocket engines, nozzles in supersonic wind tun-
nels, etc. It consists of a converging pipe, where the ﬂuid
is accelerated, followed by a throat which is the narrow-
est part of the tube and where the ﬂow undergoes a sonic
transition, and ﬁnally a diverging pipe where the ﬂuid
continues to accelerate. It is sketched in Fig. 1.

Consider now a steady, isentropic ﬂow through the noz-
zle, which has a varying cross-section A(x), where x is
the arc length along a streamline. Logarithmic diﬀeren-
tiation of the continuity equation

So narrowing the pipe will make the gas ﬂow faster,
which is what we expect from common experience.
In
fact, for very small v, equation (23) can be written as
dv/v =
dA/A and thus vA is a constant, a well known
result for incompressible ﬂuids. The situation is opposite
for v > c, when dv/dx and dA/dx have the same sign.
This means that a region of increasing cross- section will
accelerate the ﬂow. The nozzle equation (23) shows that
the transonic ﬂow through the nozzle must reach v = c
at the throat where dA/dx = 0. This is a necessary con-
dition, but not a suﬃcient one. Whether the actual ﬂow
will be transonic depends of course on the lower bound-
ary condition, i.e., the velocity v0 at the entrance of the
nozzle. For a given proﬁle A(x) of the nozzle v0 has to
have exactly the right value: if v0 is too small the ﬂow
will remain subsonic everywhere. If v0 is too large the
velocity will reach v = c upstream from the throat, at
x < xT , where dA/dx < 0 and so dv/dx
at that
point. The ﬂow will stagnate which results in a shock
between the ﬂow and the low velocity region. So in this
case there is no smooth transonic ﬂow.

→ −∞

I shall from now on assume that the boundary con-
ditions are such that there is a smooth transition from
sub to supersonic ﬂow, at the throat located at x = xT .
Given a nozzle proﬁle A(x) and an equation of state, then
Eq.
(23) together with (16) describes completely, for
x < xT , an acoustic black hole (I note that the equation
of state p = p(ρ) will allow, from Eq. (20), to have c as
a function of v). Conversely, given an equation of state,
a whole family of acoustic black holes can be obtained,
by simply varying A(x). For example, for a perfect gas,
we have [40] c2 = c2
1)/2v2, where c0 is the speed
of sound at the location corresponding to v = 0, and γ
is the ration of speciﬁc heats. Now that we have c as
function of v, Eq. (23) allows one to specify the velocity
proﬁle and therefore the full metric (16) as a function of
A(x).

B. Acoustic black holes by diﬀerent nozzle
conﬁgurations

Let us now suppose that the dependence of c on x is
small, i.e., let us assume that ∂c/∂x is not very large
(as happens for example for perfect gases), and therefore
that c
const. With the assumption of constant sound
velocity, equation (23) can be solved yielding

Let us choose the following generic form for A:

According to this diﬀerential equation, when the ﬂow is
subsonic (v < c), dv/dx and dA/dx have opposite signs.

A(x) =

e[A(xT )f (x)]

(26)

For this to be a consistent solution we must have

Equation (25) is then trivially solved by

f (xT ) =

(28)

(29)

So we conclude that in order to mimic some metric, we
have to be able to simulate the correct background ﬂow,
as indicated by Eq. (16). Now, to mimic the background
velocity, one only has to build a de Laval nozzle according
to (29), and we have our problem solved.

IV. CLASSICAL WAVE PHENOMENA NEAR
ACOUSTIC BLACK HOLES

Some classical aspects of wave propagation in acoustic
black holes have been explored in [20, 21]. Here I will
summarize some of their results and also comment on
absorption cross-sections, focusing always on the (2 + 1)-
dimensional rotating acoustic black hole [11], which I now
describe.

A simple rotating acoustic black hole geometry was
presented in [11] modeling a “draining bathtub”, ideal-
ized as a (2+1)-dimensional ﬂow with a sink at the origin.
I will show that a simple generalization of this geometry
can mimic a black brane, and I will show why, despite
recent claims [39], it is not unstable.

∼

1/r.

Consider a ﬂuid having (background) density ρ. As-
sume the ﬂuid to be locally irrotational (vorticity free),
barotropic and inviscid. From the equation of continu-
ity, the radial component of the ﬂuid velocity satisﬁes
ρvr
Irrotationality implies that the tangential
component of the velocity satisﬁes vθ
1/r. By con-
servation of angular momentum we have ρvθ
1/r, so
that the background density of the ﬂuid ρ is constant. In
turn, this means that the background pressure p and the
speed of sound c are constants. The acoustic metric de-
scribing the propagation of sound waves in this “draining
bathtub” ﬂuid ﬂow is [11]:

In the non-rotating limit B = 0 the metric (30) reduces
to a standard Painlev´e-Gullstrand-Lemaˆitre type metric
[44]. The acoustic event horizon is located at rH = A/c,
and the ergosphere forms at rES = (A2 + B2)1/2/c.

Some physical properties of our “draining bathtub”
metric are more apparent if we cast the metric in a Kerr-
like form performing the following coordinate transfor-
mation (where again we correct some typos in [59]):

Notice an important diﬀerence between this acoustic
metric and the Kerr metric:
in the (t, t) component of
the metric (33) the parameters A and B appear as a sum
of squares. This means that, at least in principle, there
is no upper bound for the rotational parameter B in the
acoustic black hole metric, contrary to what happens in
the Kerr geometry.

A. QNMs

Black holes, like so many other objects, have character-
istic oscillation or ringing modes, which are called quasi-
normal modes (QNMs) [23, 24, 25], the associated fre-
quencies being termed QN frequencies, or ωQN . The QN
frequencies of the (2 + 1)-rotating acoustic black hole,
described by the metric (33) were recently computed in
[20, 20], and so were the QNMs of the canonical acous-
tic black hole. The numerical results, consistent with a
WKB analysis, are shown in Figs. 2-5.

(i) m > 0: In Fig. 2-3 we show results pertaining to
perturbations having positive m, i.e., co-rotating waves.
In Fig. 2 we show the real part of the QN frequencies
for m = 1 modes as a function of the black hole rotation.
Higher m modes follow a similar pattern. One can see
from this plot that for low black hole rotation parameter
B the diﬀerent overtones are clearly distinguished, but
that as the rotation increases they tend to cluster and
behave very similarly. For very large rotation B, all the
overtones behave in the same manner, and in this high
rotation regime the real part of the QN frequency scales
linearly with the rotation. Indeed we ﬁnd that the slope
is also proportional to m so that

FIG. 2: The real part of the QN frequency as a function of
the rotation parameter B/A, for several overtones of a m = 1

the several lowest overtones “coalesce” in the high rotation
regime, all growing linearly with B/A.

rotation parameter B/A, for several overtones of a m = −1

critical rotation at which the mode crosses the axis, i.e., there
is a critical rotation B/A at which the real part of the QN
frequency is zero. Higher overtones cross the axis at a slower
rotation. We have not been able to follow the mode beyond
this point.

FIG. 3: The imaginary part of the QN frequency as a function
of the rotation parameter B/A, for several overtones of a m =
1 mode. It is clear from this plot that the imaginary part of
the QN frequencies of m > 0 modes is very insensitive to the
rotation of the black hole.

We notice that this behavior was already present in the
WKB investigation in [20]. In Fig. 3 we show the imag-
inary part of the QN frequencies as a function of the
rotation parameter, for m = 1. Diﬀerent overtones have
diﬀerent imaginary parts. Note also that for high B the
real part of the modes coalesce whereas the imaginary
part does not. The magnitude of Im[ωQN ] increases with
B, which was observed also in the WKB approach [20].
Thus, as the rotation increases the perturbation dies oﬀ
quicker. This also means that the black hole is stable
against m > 0 perturbations, because the imaginary part
is always negative.

perturbations having negative m, i.e., counter-rotating

the real part of the QN frequency is zero). Nevertheless, an
judging by the modes we did manage to follow, namely the
fundamental mode, it seems that Im[ωQN ] never crosses the

waves. The behavior of the QN frequencies for m < 0
is drastically diﬀerent from the m > 0 perturbations. In
Fig. 4 we plot the dependence of Re[ωQN ] as a function
of the rotation of the black hole B. As B increases the
magnitude of the real part of the QN frequency decreases.
The oscillation frequencies for the fundamental modes,
labeled by n = 0, indeed get close to the horizontal axis as
B goes to inﬁnity. However, we haven’t been able to track

some overtone modes with negative m for very high rota-
tion since, as can be seen in Fig. 4, the real part of these
modes eventually change sign. It is extremely diﬃcult,
using the method employed here, to compute modes hav-

B. Late-time tails

The existence of late-time tails in black hole spacetimes
is well established, both analytically and numerically, in
linearized perturbations and even in a non-linear evolu-
tion, for massless or massive ﬁelds [27]. This is a prob-
lem of more than academic interest: one knows that a
black hole radiates away everything that it can, by the
so called no hair theorem (see [45] for a nice review), but
how does this hair loss proceed dynamically? A more or
less complete picture is now available. The study of a
fairly general class of initial data evolution shows that
the signal can roughly be divided in three parts: (i) the
ﬁrst part is the prompt response, at very early times, and
the form depends strongly on the initial conditions. This
is the most intuitive phase, being the obvious counter-
part of the light cone propagation. (ii) at intermediate
times the signal is dominated by an exponentially decay-
ing ringing phase, and its form depends entirely on the
black hole characteristics, through its associated quasi-
normal modes [23, 25, 46]. (iii) a late-time tail, usually
a power law falloﬀ of the ﬁeld. This power law seems to
be highly independent of the initial data, and seems to

7

persist even if there is no black hole horizon. In fact it
depends only on the asymptotic far region.

It is not generally appreciated that there is another
case in which wave propagation develops tails: wave
propagation in odd dimensional ﬂat spacetimes. In fact,
the Green’s function in a D-dimensional spacetime (see
Cardoso et al in [27] and also [47, 48]) have a completely
diﬀerent structure depending on whether D is even or
odd. For even D it still has support only on the light
cone, but for odd D the support of the Green’s function
extends to the interior of the light cone, and leads to the
appearance of tails.

Analogue black holes also exhibit late-time tails, shed-
ding their hair in a power-law falloﬀ manner. As an ele-
gant application of the wave tail formalism developed by
Ching et al [27], it was found in [20] that any perturbation
in the vicinity of the (2 + 1)-dimensional analogue black
hole described by (33) eventually decays as a power-law
falloﬀ of the form

−(2m+1) .

∼

(37)

On the other hand, this s precisely the tails that appear
in any (2 + 1)-dimensional ﬂat spacetime (see Cardoso et
al in [27]). We thus have a consistent and elegant result.

C. Superradiant ampliﬁcation of phonons

Rotating black holes can superradiate, in the sense
that in a scattering experiment the scattered wave has
a larger amplitude (the frequency is the same, this is
not a Doppler eﬀect has explained in [17] and references
therein) than the incident wave. Superradiance is a gen-
eral phenomenon in physics. Inertial motion superradi-
ance has long been known [49], and refers to the pos-
sibility that a (possibly electrically neutral) object en-
dowed with internal structure, moving uniformly through
a medium, may emit photons even when it starts oﬀ in its
ground state. Some examples of inertial motion superra-
diance include the Cherenkov eﬀect, the Landau criterion
for disappearance of superﬂuidity, and Mach shocks for
solid objects travelling through a ﬂuid (cf. [19] for a dis-
cussion). Non-inertial rotational motion also produces
superradiance. This was discovered by Zel’dovich [17],
who pointed out that a cylinder made of absorbing ma-
terial and rotating around its axis with frequency Ω can
amplify modes of scalar or electromagnetic radiation of
frequency ω, provided the condition

ω < mΩ

(38)

(where m is the azimuthal quantum number with respect
to the axis of rotation) is satisﬁed. Zel’dovich realized
that, accounting for quantum eﬀects, the rotating object
should emit spontaneously in this superradiant regime.
He then suggested that a Kerr black hole whose angular
velocity at the horizon is Ω will show both ampliﬁcation
and spontaneous emission when the condition (38) for

superradiance is satisﬁed. This suggestion was put on
ﬁrmer ground by a substantial body of work [50]. In par-
ticular, it became clear that (even at the purely classical
level) superradiance is required to satisfy Hawking’s area
theorem [51, 52].

Superradiance is essentially related to the presence of
an ergosphere, allowing the extraction of rotational en-
ergy from a black hole through a wave equivalent of the
Penrose process [53]. Under certain conditions, superra-
diance can be used to induce instabilities in Kerr black
holes [31].
Indeed, all spacetimes admitting an ergo-
sphere and no horizon are unstable due to rotational
superradiance. This was shown rigorously in [54], but
the growth rate of the instability is too slow to observe
it in an astrophysical context [55, 56]. Kerr black holes
are stable, but if enclosed by a reﬂecting mirror they can
become unstable due to superradiance [51, 57];

The possibility to observe rotational superradiance in
analogue black holes was considered by Sch¨utzhold and
Unruh [38], and more extensively by Basak and Majum-
dar [58, 59], who computed analytically the reﬂection
coeﬃcients in the low frequency limit ωA/c2
In
particular, the authors of [38] showed that the ergore-
gion instability in gravity wave analogues is related to
the existence of an “energy function” [their Eq.
(68)]
that is not positive deﬁnite inside the ergosphere. In the
context of analogues, inertial superradiance based on su-
perﬂuid 3He has been studied by Jacobson and Volovik
[60]. The explicit numerical calculation of reﬂection co-
eﬃcients for the (2 + 1)-rotating acoustic black hole was
done in [20], in the superradiant regime.

similar to what happens when one deals with massless
ﬁelds in the vicinities of rotating Kerr black holes [51].
In particular, from the close-up view in the middle pan-
els we see that, for B = 1, the maximum ampliﬁcation is
21.2 % (m = 1) and 4.7 % (m = 2).

∼

As a ﬁnal remark, and as we have anticipated, an im-
portant diﬀerence between the acoustic black hole metric
and the Kerr metric is that in the present case there is
no mathematical upper limit on the black hole’s rota-
tional velocity B. In the bottom panels we show that,
considering values of B > 1, we can indeed have larger
ampliﬁcation factors for acoustic black holes.

Summarizing: if we are clever enough to build in the
lab an acoustic black hole that spins very rapidly, rota-
tional superradiance can be particularly eﬃcient in ana-
logues. This is an important result, considering that the

indicated. The top panels show that the reﬂection coeﬃcient
decays exponentially at the critical frequency for superradi-
ance, ωSR = mB. The middle panels show a close-up view in
the superradiant regime for B < 1: at B = 1 the maximum
ampliﬁcation is 21.2 %. The bottom panels show that su-
perradiant ampliﬁcation can become much more eﬃcient for
values of the rotation parameter B > 1.

detection of rotational superradiance in the lab is by no
means an easy task, as originally predicted by Zel’dovich
[17] and conﬁrmed by recent reconsiderations of the prob-
lem [19]. Of course, in any real-world experiment the
maximum rotational parameter will be limited. At the
mathematical level, the equations describing sound prop-
agation (which are written assuming the hydrodynamic
approximation) will eventually break down. Physically,
if the angular component of the velocity vθ becomes very
large the dispersion relation for the ﬂuid will change, in-

The superradiant phenomena we have described are
purely classical in nature. However, an interesting sug-
gestion to observe quantum eﬀects in acoustic superradi-
ance was put forward in [59]. To write down our acoustic
metric we required the ﬂow to be irrotational and nonvis-
cous. As a natural choice, we could use a ﬂuid which is
well known to possess precisely these properties: super-
ﬂuid HeII. In this case the presence of vortices with quan-
tized angular momenta may lead to a quantized energy
ﬂux. The heuristic argument presented in [59] goes as fol-
lows. Let us imagine that our black hole is a vortex with
a sink at the centre. In the quantum theory of HeII the
,
wavefunction is of the form Ψ = exp
where ~rj is the position of the j-th particle of HeII. The
i
velocity at any point is given by the gradient of the phase
at that point, ~v =
φ, so that (roughly speaking) the
velocity potential can be identiﬁed with the phase of the
wavefunction. This phase will be singular at the sink
r = 0. Continuity of the phase around a circle surround-
ing the sink requires that the change of the wavefunction
satisﬁes ∆φ = 2πB. For the wavefunction to be single
valued, B (that is, the black hole’s angular velocity at the
horizon) must be the integer multiple of some minimum
value ∆B, i.e., B = n ∆B. Then the angular momentum
of the acoustic black hole would be forced to change in in-
teger multiples of ∆B. Correspondingly, the spectrum of
the reﬂection coeﬃcients may be given by equally-spaced
peaks with diﬀerent strengths. This discrete ampliﬁca-
tion could enhance chances of observing superradiance
in acoustic black holes, and rule out (or provide empir-
ical support to) some of the many competing heuristic
approaches to black hole quantization.

It is known that the Kerr geometry, or any rotating
(absorbing) body displays superradiance [17, 61]. This
means that in a scattering experiment of a wave with
frequency ω < mΩ the scattered wave will have a larger
amplitude than the incident wave, the excess energy be-
ing withdrawn from the object’s rotational energy. Here
Ω is the horizon’s angular velocity and m is an azimuthal
quantum number. Now suppose that one encloses the
rotating black hole in a spherical mirror. Any initial per-
turbation will get successively ampliﬁed near the black
hole event horizon and reﬂected back at the mirror, thus
creating an instability. This is the black hole bomb, as
devised in [51] and recently improved in [57]. This in-
stability is caused by the mirror, which is an artiﬁcial
wall, but one can devise “natural mirrors” if one consid-
ers massive ﬁelds. Imagine a wavepacket of the massive
ﬁeld in a distant circular orbit. The gravitational force
binds the ﬁeld and keeps it from escaping or radiating
away to inﬁnity. But at the event horizon some of the
ﬁeld goes down the black hole, and if the frequency of the
ﬁeld is in the superradiant region then the ﬁeld is ampli-
ﬁed. Hence the ﬁeld is ampliﬁed at the event horizon
while being bound away from inﬁnity. Yet another way
to understand this, is to think in terms of wave propaga-
tion in an eﬀective potential. If the eﬀective potential has
a well, then waves get “trapped” in the well and ampliﬁed
by superradiance, thus triggering an instability. In the
case of massive ﬁelds on a (four-dimensional) Kerr back-
ground, the eﬀective potential indeed has a well, as we
show in Figure 7. Consequently, the massive ﬁeld grows
exponentially and is unstable (see [31, 32, 33, 34, 39] for

Notice that for constant ρ , c one recovers the equations
(42), as one should. Now, it is quite easy to present an
example ﬂow which the instability is triggered: take for
instance a ﬂow for which ρ is almost constant at inﬁnity
(almost means that it asymptotes to a constant value
more rapidly than the sound velocity). Assume also that,
near inﬁnity, c = c1 + c2
r . Then, we get that near inﬁnity
the eﬀective potential behaves as

2c1c2k2
r

.

(52)

For this to have a positive derivative, one requires c2 < 0
(c1 must be positive, as it is the asymptotic value of the
sound velocity). We thus have one example of ﬂow for
which the instability is active. There are many others, of
course, and there are also instances for which the system
is stable.

E. Absorption cross-sections

The computation of absorption cross-sections may be
handled analytically in the low frequency regime, to
which I now turn. The computation of absorption cross-
sections of diﬀerent gravitational black holes has gained
a special interest some years ago, since it was shown that
string theory could reproduce these results (for some par-
ticular geometries). I refer the reader to [8] for a intro-
duction to the subject. Considering again our (2 + 1)-
dimensional rotating acoustic black hole we shall now
attempt at solving the wave equation in this geometry,
in the limit of small ω. The method we use here follows
closely the work of Starobinsky and Churilov [50] and
Unruh and others [65]. The wave equation reads [20]:

FIG. 7: A typical form for the eﬀective potential in the Kerr

the mass of the black hole M = 1, so the rotation parameter
a varies between 0 (Schwarzschild limit) and 1/2 (extremal
limit). Here we plot the eﬀective potential for the near ex-
treme situation, a ∼ 0.5 and for µ = 0.7 and ω = 0.6878.

explicit examples). With this in mind, we would expect
that black strings and branes of the form (39) for which
there is a bound state will be unstable; here the trans-
verse direction z works as an eﬀective mass for the sound
wave. To get a bound state, one necessary condition is
that the derivative of the potential is positive, at asymp-
totic large radial distances (see [39] for more details).

This is the ﬁnal expression. Since α, β are related to
the amplitude of in- and out-going waves at inﬁnity, using
(69) we can straightforwardly compute reﬂection coeﬃ-
cients, absorption cross sections, etc.

V. CONCLUSIONS

(61)

(62)

Analogue black holes have proven to be a very valuable
tool for the investigation of problems related to Hawking
radiation. It is also possible that will yield valuable in-
formation regarding classical phenomena involving black
holes. We have shown here some aspects of classical phe-
nomena involving acoustic black holes, that may prove
useful for future experimental realization of these sys-
tems.

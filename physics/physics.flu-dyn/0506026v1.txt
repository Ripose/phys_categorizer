Parametric Autoresonance in Faraday waves

Michael Assaf and Baruch Meerson
Racah Institute of Physics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel

We develop a theory of parametric excitation of weakly nonlinear standing gravity waves in a tank,
which is under vertical vibrations with a slowly time-dependent (“chirped”) vibration frequency.
We show that, by using a negative chirp, one can excite a steadily growing wave via parametric
autoresonance. The method of averaging is employed to derive the governing equations for the
primary mode. These equations are solved analytically and numerically, for typical initial conditions,
for both inviscid and weakly viscous ﬂuids.
It is shown that, when passing through resonance,
capture into resonance always occurs when the chirp rate is suﬃciently small. The critical chirp
rate, above which breakdown of autoresonance occurs, is found for diﬀerent initial conditions. The
autoresonance excitation is expected to terminate at large amplitudes, when the underlying constant-
frequency system ceases to exhibit a non-trivial stable ﬁxed point.

INTRODUCTION

There are two ways of driving a classical nonlinear os-
cillator by a small oscillating force: via either external or
parametric resonance. In both cases, the initial growth of
the amplitude of the oscillator is arrested, even without
dissipation, when nonlinear eﬀects come into play. This
is due to the fact that the natural frequency of a non-
linear oscillator is amplitude-dependent, so a mismatch
between the (invariable) driving frequency and the nat-
ural frequency appears [1].

To overcome the nonlinear mismatch and maintain
phase locking between the driving force and the oscilla-
tor, one can slowly vary the driving frequency with time
so as to achieve a persistent growth of the oscillations.
This simple and versatile method is called autoresonance:
either external, or parametric. To emphasize the diﬀer-
ence between the two, let us watch a child on a swing.
When a parent pushes the swing (once in each cycle), he
gradually increases the time interval between the pushes
as the swing amplitude grows. Here he employs external
autoresonance. On the contrary, when the child swings
himself (he achieves it by moving the position of his cen-
ter of mass up and down twice in each cycle), he gradually
increases the period of these modulations as the swing
amplitude grows. This is parametric autoresonance.

The simple model of a nonlinear oscillator, excited via
external autoresonance, has found numerous applications
in physics, see e.g. Ref.
[2] for a brief review. The ex-
ternal autoresonance scheme has been also generalized to
systems with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom,
such as nonlinear waves [3, 4, 5] and vortices [6].
In
contrast to the external autoresonance, parametric au-
toresonance has received much less attention [7]. In this
work we generalize to nonlinear waves the theory, devel-
oped in Ref.
[7] for a nonlinear oscillator. Speciﬁcally,
we show that the parametric autoresonance mechanism
can be used for driving nonlinear standing gravity waves
with a steadily growing amplitude on a free surface of a
ﬂuid.

Michael Faraday [8] was the ﬁrst to observe that, when

a tank containing a ﬂuid is periodically vibrated in the
vertical direction, a standing wave pattern forms at the
free surface of the ﬂuid when the vibration frequency is
twice the frequency of the surface vibrations. This phe-
nomenon is a classic example of parametric resonance,
because the vertical acceleration of the tank - an intrin-
sic parameter of the system - depends on time via the
periodic vibration. Lord Rayleigh [9] carried out a fur-
ther series of experiments, which supported Faraday’s ob-
servations, and also developed a linear theory for these
waves in terms of a linear Mathieu equation. Benjamin
and Ursell [10] advanced the linear theory further. Sub-
sequently, Miles [11, 12, 13], Douady [14], Milner [15],
and Decent and Craik [16] formulated a weakly nonlin-
ear theory based on amplitude expansion, while some of
these and indeed numerous other works dealt with exper-
imental studies of Faraday waves.

Being interested in parametric autoresonance, we add
a new dimension to the problem of Faraday waves and in-
vestigate weakly nonlinear standing gravity waves formed
when the vibration frequency is slowly decreased (chirped
downwards) in time. We show that the negative fre-
quency chirp causes a persistent growth of the wave am-
plitude. Like in other instances of autoresonance, the ex-
act form of the frequency chirp is unimportant once the
chirp sign is correct, and the chirp rate is not too high.
The autoresonance excitation is expected to terminate at
large amplitudes, when an underlying dynamical system,
corresponding to the case of a constant frequency, ceases
to exhibit a non-trivial stable ﬁxed point.

Here is the layout of the rest of the paper. Section II
presents a brief overview of theory of weakly nonlinear
Faraday waves with a constant driving frequency. Sec-
tions III and IV deal with theory of chirped Faraday
waves, in inviscid (Sec. III) and low-viscosity (Sec. IV)
ﬂuids. Section V presents a brief discussion of our results.

II. WEAKLY NONLINEAR FARADAY WAVES

Eqs. (3)-(6) in the following form [11, 12]:

A.

Inviscid ﬂuid

To set the stage for a theory of chirped Faraday waves,
we need to brieﬂy review the theory of weakly nonlinear
Faraday waves with a constant driving frequency. Con-
sider a quasi-two-dimensional rectangular tank with a
ﬂuid of length l, width w and depth h, so that l
w. We
assume that the elevation of the ﬂuid, caused by the wave,
depends only on the longitudinal coordinate x and time
t, so that we have a quasi-two-dimensional ﬂow in the
xz plane (z is the vertical coordinate). The unperturbed
level of the ﬂuid is at z = 0. The vertical displacement
of the vibrating tank is described by the equation

≫

ζ(t) = a0 cos(2ω t) .

(1)

We assume weak forcing, that is the vibration acceler-
ation is much less than the gravity acceleration g, and
introduce a small dimensionless parameter ε:

ω2a0

ε =

1 .

g ≪

(2)

In the limit of inviscid ﬂuid the ﬂow remains potential
once it is potential at t = 0, and the external forces
are potential [17], as is the case here. The assump-
tion of a potential ﬂow is also approximately valid in
a low-viscosity ﬂuid [10]. We also assume that the wave-
length of the standing wave is much larger than the cap-
illary length of the ﬂuid and neglect the capillary eﬀects
throughout the paper. The linear dispersion relation for
the wave is ω2
n = gkn tanh(knh), where ωn is the natural
frequency of the n-th mode, kn = 2π/λn = nπ/l is the
wave number of the n-th mode, and n = 1, 2, . . ..

The governing equations for the velocity potential
ϕ(x, z, t) and the wave proﬁle η(x, t) are [10, 17, 18, 19]:

where indices denote partial derivatives. The Laplace’s
equation (3) describes a potential ﬂow of an incompress-
ible ﬂuid. Equations (4) and (5) are the Navier-Stokes
equation and the kinematic boundary condition, respec-
tively, evaluated at the free surface. Finally, Eq. (6) is
the boundary condition for the vertical velocity compo-
nent at the bottom of the tank.

Let the vibration frequency be close to twice the nat-
ural frequency of the primary mode n = 1, i.e. ω
ω1,
so that this mode is excited via parametric resonance. In
a weakly nonlinear regime it suﬃces to account for the
excitation of only one higher order mode: the secondary
mode n = 2, which is enslaved to the primary mode [12].
Therefore, one should look for ϕ(x, z, t) and η(x, t) in

where the eigenfunctions ψn(x) = √2 cos (knx). The
higher order terms will be neglected in the following. In
1, the linear dispersion rela-
the deep-water limit knh
tion for the wave becomes ω2
gkn. For this approx-
imation to hold with an error less than 0.5%, it suﬃces
to demand that h > l.

n ≃

≫

The perturbation theory we are using employs the
smallness of ε. As will be seen later, this smallness
implies a smallness of the wave amplitude compared
with the wavelength, so that the dimensionless param-
eter κ = k1η is small. Expanding ϕ(x, z = η, t) in the
vicinity of the unperturbed surface z = 0 in a power
series in κ, and substituting it and the second of Eqs.
(7) into Eqs. (4) and (5), we obtain in the leading and
sub-leading orders of κ:

Taking into account a weak damping of the wave
amounts to adding a linear damping term 2γ ˙η1 to the left

side of Eq. (10), where γ is deﬁned in terms of the rate
of loss of mechanical energy due to dissipation, [18]. The
incorporation of only a linear damping term requires that

The speciﬁc damping mechanisms which contribute to
the value of damping rate γ are the bulk viscosity [18],
dissipation in the vicinity of the ﬁxed walls [24], dissipa-
tion at the free surface (especially if contaminated) [24]
and contact line damping [25] (see, e.g. Ref.
[25] for
a review).
In practice, one can interpret the damping
rate as a phenomenological term, and determine it from
a comparison with experiment.

on the phase plane of the system (except for trajectories
with a zero measure) converges to a stable focus, see Fig.
2. This is in contrast to the inviscid case, where start-
ing from initial conditions outside the separatrix leaves
the trajectory phase-unlocked. The ﬁxed points [B∗, φ∗]

III. CHIRPED FARADAY WAVES IN AN
INVISCID FLUID

A. Governing equations, phase portrait, criteria
and numerical examples

Now let the vibration frequency be time-dependent
(chirped): ω = ω(t). In general, the dimensionless pa-
rameter ε = ω2a0/g will also become time-dependent.
For simplicity, we shall assume that a0 also varies in time
so that ε = const [26]. Our objective is to keep a Faraday
wave close to resonance in spite of its nonlinear frequency
shift, so as to achieve a persistent growth of the wave am-
plitude. Like in other autoresonance schemes, the exact
form of the function ω(t) is unimportant if this function
satisﬁes three criteria:

1. The chirp sign coincides with the sign of the non-
linear frequency shift of the wave. For the standing
Faraday waves ω(t) should decrease for the wave
amplitude to increase.

2. The frequency chirp rate must be suﬃciently small,
so that the phase portrait of the system evolves
adiabatically:

Tnl ≪

Criteria 1 and 2 have appeared in previous works on
autoresonance [2], while criterion 3 is new. We shall see
shortly that, in the problem of parametric autoresonance,
criterion 3 is more restrictive than criterion 2.

The derivation of the equation of motion for the pri-
mary mode amplitude, for a slowly time-dependent driv-
ing frequency, goes along the same lines as in the case of
a constant driving frequency. The resulting equation is

If ε is small, and the chirp
where Φ(t) =

again use, close to the parametric resonance, the method
of averaging [7]. For concreteness, we assume in this work
a constant chirp rate µ:

plitude B as before [see Eq. (12)], we arrive at the fol-
lowing scaled equations:

we obtain:

Once B(t) and φ(t) are found, one can immediately re-
construct the standing way proﬁle η(x, t) by using the
Ansatz η1(t) = A1(t) cos [ω1t + φ1(t)] and the “enslaving
relation” (8) in the second of equations (7). Therefore,
in the rest of the paper we shall focus on Eqs. (22) which
coincide, up to notation, with those obtained by Khain
and Meerson [7], who investigated parametric autoreso-
nance in a nonlinear oscillator. Equations similar to (22)
also appear in the problem of the second-harmonic au-
toresonance in an externally driven oscillator [27].

Figure 5 shows an example of parametric autores-
onance: a persistent phase locking and a systematic
growth of I with time, with some oscillations on top of
the systematic growth. Here the scaled chirp rate m is
less than some critical value mcr for these initial condi-
tions. Figure 6 illustrates breakdown of autoresonance,
observed when m > mcr. As in other instances of au-
toresonance, a theory of parametric autoresonance ap-
peals to the constant-frequency theory. Comparing Eqs.

We found that, surprisingly, unstable quasi-ﬁxed points
of the chirped system also play an important role in
the dynamics. The unstable points are analogs of the

Hamiltonian, H(φ, u, t) = u2/2 + V (φ, t), there is a clear
separation between the potential energy and the kinetic
energy. The new Hamiltonian describes a “particle” of
a unit mass and velocity u = ˙φ, moving in a time-
dependent potential V . This picture is useful for a quali-

which separates the phase locking regime from the phase

until the scaled amplitude becomes of order unity, see

What is the signature of the special case m = mcr? At
m < mcr the phase oscillates in time. As m approaches
mcr from below, the onset of the phase oscillations is de-
layed more and more, see Fig. 10. Now, at m > mcr the
phase initially changes slowly and then rapidly escapes to
inﬁnity. As m approaches mcr from above, the point of
rapid departure of the phase is delayed more and more,
as shown in Fig. 10. This suggests that, in the spe-
cial case m = mcr the phase neither oscillates around a
trend, nor departs from it. Instead, the phase monotoni-
cally approaches π/2. Looking at the eﬀective potential,
shown in Fig. 7, one realizes that, in the special case
m = mcr, our “particle” neither oscillates in the poten-
tial well (which would correspond to phase locking), nor
escapes from the well (which would correspond to phase

B. Perturbative solutions

In this subsection we present three perturbative ana-
lytic solutions which illustrate the basic features of para-
metric autoresonance: persistent resonant growth, cap-
ture into resonance and the limiting trajectory which sep-
arates between phase locking and unlocking. In each of
the three cases, a local analysis around one of the quasi-
ﬁxed points of the system is required.

interested in the capture into resonance. In the case of
external autoresonance this phenomenon has been exten-
sively studied by Friedland [2]. In the case of parametric
autoresonance this phenomenon has not been addressed,
although equations similar to (22) were analyzed in Ref.
[27] in the context of the second-harmonic autoresonance
in an externally driven oscillator.

We start, in Eqs. (21), at a large negative time t0 < 0,

of the special trajectory with respect to small perturba-

the phase leaves the vicinities of the saddle point and
goes to the vicinity of the stable quasi-ﬁxed point), and
at m > mcr (when the phase locking terminates). For
the special trajectory, obtained for m = mcr, the coeﬃ-
cient C2 must vanish, which brings us back to Eqs. (45)

that the asymptotic behavior of the φ∗(t) at m = mcr is
independent of mcr and, therefore, on the initial condi-
tions. On the contrary, the asymptotic behavior of I∗(t)
at m = mcr does depend on mcr and, therefore, on the
initial conditions. Unfortunately, the local analysis does
not enable one to ﬁnd the value of mcr analytically.

O

Figures 13 and 14 show the behavior of the system
when m is very close to (just below) mcr. Figure 13 shows
that, after a time
(1), the phase follows the trend (45),
independently of the initial conditions (and of the value
of mcr). Figure 14 shows that, after a time of
(1), good
agreement between I(t), found numerically, and the trend
(46) holds until the time when the “particle” leaves the
vicinity of the unstable point and transfers to the vicinity
of the stable point.

Γcr = 2/√5 = 0.89 . . . here, see Eq.
(18). Figure
16 shows decaying oscillations on top of the amplitude
growth, given by the ﬁrst of Eqs. (49). Figure 17 shows
a non-oscillatory regime of the amplitude growth. Fig-

V. DISCUSSION

This paper presents a theory of weakly nonlinear
standing gravity waves, parametrically excited by weak
vertical vibrations with a down-chirped vibration fre-
quency. We have shown that autoresonance phase locking
and a steadily growing wave amplitude can be achieved
despite the nonlinear frequency shift of the wave. For
typical initial conditions we have found the critical chirp
rate, above which autoresonance breaks down. When
starting from a very small wave amplitude, and slowly
passing through resonance, phase locking always occurs.
We have obtained approximate analytical expressions for
the time-dependent wave proﬁle in diﬀerent regimes. We
have demonstrated that each of the three quasi-ﬁxed
points of the reduced dynamic equation, describing the
primary mode, plays an important role in the dynamics
of the system and/or in determining the critical chirp
rate.

Parametric autoresonance in Faraday waves is a robust
phenomenon, and its experimental observation should
not be diﬃcult. To test our theory, one should use a
quasi-two-dimensional tank with a low-viscosity liquid,
and perform measurements of the standing wave eleva-
tion as a function of time. The long-term wave amplitude
trend [see the ﬁrst of Eqs. (49)], and the critical chirp
rate (see Fig. 20), give examples of quantitative predic-
tions of the theory that can be tested in experiment. One
such experiment is presently under way [30].

The applicability of the weakly nonlinear theory pre-
sented in this work is limited to weak forcing and weak
damping. Our analysis neglected higher order terms in
ε, which include a nonlinear forcing [13], a cubic damp-
ing [13, 14, 15], a small correction to the linear detun-
ing/frequency shift, a quintic conservative term [16], etc.
These terms can be included in the theory of autores-
onance in order to achieve a better accuracy.
Impor-
tantly, once these higher-order terms are added to the
constant-frequency model [Eq. (17)], the non-trivial sta-
ble ﬁxed point will exist only up to a certain value of the
frequency detuning [13, 14, 15, 16]. Therefore, in exper-
iment, the autoresonant growth of the wave is expected
to terminate when the (time-dependent) frequency de-
tuning comes close to the maximum value, for which the
non-trivial stable ﬁxed point in the underlying constant-
frequency model still exists. The breakdown of autoreso-
nance is expected to occur at an amplitude smaller than
the wave-breaking amplitude, which is comparable to the
wavelength [31].

The case of travelling waves is diﬀerent. It was Stokes
who ﬁrst showed that, for travelling waves, the nonlinear

can be attributed to nonlinear interaction between two
travelling waves which form a standing wave.

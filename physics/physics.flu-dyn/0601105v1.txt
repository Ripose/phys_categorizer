We compute numerically the threshold for dynamo action in Taylor-Green swirling ﬂows. Kine-
matic calculations, for which the ﬂow ﬁeld is ﬁxed to its time averaged proﬁle, are compared to
dynamical runs for which both the Navier-Stokes and the induction equations are jointly solved.
The kinematic instability is found to have two branches, for all explored Reynolds numbers. The
dynamical dynamo threshold follows these branches: at low Reynolds number it lies within the low
branch while at high kinetic Reynolds number it is close to the high branch.

The magnetic ﬁeld of planets and stars is believed
to be the result of a dynamo instability originating in
the ﬂow motions inside their electrically conducting ﬂuid
core. Dynamo occurs when induction due to motion over-
comes diﬀusion [1], corresponding to a threshold in the
magnetic Reynolds number of the ﬂow (RM = U L/η,
with U and L characteristic velocity and length scales
of the ﬂow, and η the ﬂuid’s magnetic diﬀusivity). For
liquid metals (as molten iron in the Earth core, or liq-
uid sodium in laboratory experiments [2]), the kinematic
viscosity ν is several orders of magnitude lower that the
magnetic diﬀusivity η – the magnetic Prandtl number
PM = ν/η is often of the order of 10−5 or lower. As a
result, the kinetic Reynolds number of dynamo generat-
ing ﬂows tends to be very high. Indeed, the relationship
RV = U L/ν = RM /PM implies that critical values Rc
M
of the order of few tens are associated with Reynolds
numbers in excess of one million. This remark prompts
two initial questions: (i) can a dynamo instability de-
velop from a fully turbulent ﬂow?, and (ii) what is the
evolution of the instability threshold as RV grows? We
partially addressed them in a previous numerical work [3]
for a ﬂow generated by a deterministic Taylor-Green forc-
ing at large scales. Lowering the magnetic Prandtl num-
ber PM from 1 to 10−2, we established that the laminar
Rc
M value undergoes an eightfold increase as unsteadiness
and small scale motion develop, and that once turbulence
is fully established the threshold Rc
M tends to saturate
to a constant value. Dynamo action is thus preserved
for ﬂows having a well deﬁned large scale geometry, a
question still open for turbulent motion without a mean
ﬂow [4]. Numerical predictions of a dynamo threshold in
realistic natural or experimental conditions are still out
of reach; numerical simulations cannot get close to the
parameter range of planetary bodies or laboratory ex-
periments (even if one ignores the question of boundary
conditions, a DNS study at PM ∼ 10−5 would require a
resolution in excess of (105)3 grid points). Nonetheless,
the ﬂuid dynamo experiments [5] in Riga and Karlsruhe
found the onset to be remarkably close to the values pre-

dicted from numerical simulations based on the mean
ﬂow structure [6], and this despite the fact that the cor-
responding ﬂows are quite turbulent. It has led several
experimental groups seeking dynamo action in less con-
straint geometry, eventually leading to richer dynamical
regimes, to optimize the ﬂow forcing using kinematic sim-
ulations based on mean ﬂow measurements [7, 8] – with
the advantage that mean ﬂow proﬁles can be measured
in the laboratory. It is thus of interest to test the validity
of this procedure in numerical experiments.

In this Letter, we compare numerically the dynamo
behavior as simulated from the dynamical magnetohy-
drodynamics (MHD) equations to the result of kinematic
calculations in which the velocity is ﬁxed to its time aver-
aged proﬁle. In the fully dynamical problem, we integrate
pseudospectrally the MHD equations :

density is assumed. Here, v stands for the velocity ﬁeld,

with k0 = 1. For a given ﬂuid viscosity and forcing am-
plitude, we ﬁrst allow the ﬂow to settle into a statisti-
cally steady state, in a nonmagnetic phase (Eq. 1 with
B = 0). We either use Direct Numerical Simulations
(DNS) for ﬂows at PM of order one, or Large Eddy Sim-
ulation (LES) schemes with an eﬀective viscosity νeﬀ [10]
for PM lower than about 0.1. In the results reported here
(cf. Table I), the forcing ﬂow amplitude is kept equal to

1.5, and the Reynolds number is increased by lowering
the ﬂuid’s viscosity. Once the steady state is reached, a
seed magnetic ﬁeld with energy 10−20, evenly distributed
among Fourier modes, is introduced and the MHD equa-
tions are integrated for several choices of the ﬂuid’s mag-
netic diﬀusivity. For each, we compute the exponential
growth rate σB = d(ln EB)/dt. The critical Rc
M,dyn, for
which σB changes its sign, is thus obtained at constant
RV in a dynamical process for which the velocity ﬁeld is
a true Navier-Stokes ﬂow.

In the kinematic study, we ﬁrst compute the mean ﬂow
as an average in time of the velocity ﬁelds generated in
the dynamical runs:

U(r) =

dt v(r, t) ,

(4)

T Z

where T is a time scale chosen much larger than a typical
eddy turnover time at the ﬂow integral scale Ldyn: TNL =
Udyn/Ldyn (Udyn: characteristic velocity). Note that T
should exceed the magnetic diﬀusion time TM = RM TNL.
In practice, an instantaneous velocity ﬁeld is extracted
every time interval ∆T to increment the running average
of U(r). We have used ∆T ∼ TNL/100, and T > 200TNL.
To save computer time, the averaging is done during the
linear growth (or decay) phase – hence in the absence of
a Lorentz feed-back in the Navier-Stokes equation. The
induction equation (2) is then solved with v(r, t) kept
equal to U(r), in search of growing solutions B(r, t) =
B(r). We note that the mean ﬂow deﬁned in
exp
Eq. 4 is not a real ﬂow in the sense that it is no longer
a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations; for instance,
it does not have a viscosity. We chose to attribute it
the viscosity of the generating dynamical run. Then one
could compute an associated kinematic Reynolds number
Rv,kin = UkinLkin/ν, but we have chosen to represent all
Reynolds number variation as a function of RV ≡ RV,dyn

Before analyzing the dynamo behavior, we ﬁrst com-
pare characteristics of the dynamic and time-averaged
velocity ﬁelds. Their spectra are shown in Fig. 1(a), for
ﬁelds originating in the DNS calculation at RV,dyn = 670.
While the dynamical ﬂow has a typical turbulence spec-
trum, the time-averaged ﬁeld is sharply peaked at the
size of the Taylor-Green cell. As the Reynolds number
varies, the quantities for the average ﬂow remain con-
stant, while they do vary for the dynamical ﬁeld. For
instance, the ﬂow integral scale is shown in Fig. 1(b). It
is computed from the kinetic energy spectra

the turbulent ﬂow has an integral length scale clearly
conﬁned within the Taylor-Green cell. On the opposite,
the mean ﬂow has Lkin ∼ π and Ukin ∼ 3.0 at all RV ’s.

We now turn to the dynamo generation. In the fully
dynamical problem, the Rc
M,dyn(RV ) curve – Fig.2(b) –
displays an initial increase, corresponding to the devel-
opment of turbulence, followed by a plateau [3]. The
dynamo threshold is then independent of the ﬂuid’s vis-
cosity. This is understood if we recall that the dynamo
is governed by large scale motions : indeed, in TG ﬂows,
we have reported [11] that in the early stage all Fourier
modes grow at the same rate, but after a few hundred
large scale turnover times only the modes near the TG
forcing keep growing while the small scales are quenched.
Besides, it is a common observation in ﬂuid mechan-

ics [12] that the geometry of a shear ﬂow becomes in-
dependent of the Reynolds number at high RV , except
for viscous sub-layers near boundaries. One thus expects
that, for ﬂows having a well deﬁned geometry, the dy-
namo persists at all (small) magnetic Prandtl numbers,
with a ﬁnite value of Rc
M as RV → ∞. See also [13] and
references therein for a recent discussion.

M,kin, Rc2
M,kin. Beyond Rc3

For the time-averaged ﬂow, we have observed the ex-
istence of two dynamo branches in the kinematic sim-
ulation of the induction equation – a behavior already
noted for the ABC ﬂow [14]. As shown in Fig. 2(a),
the kinematic growth rate is positive in the interval
[Rc1
M,kin] ∼ [22, 51], and then again for RM,kin >
Rc3
M,kin, the growth rate seems to be a
monotonously increasing function of RM . The ﬁrst dy-
namo window is found to be essentially independent of
the kinetic Reynolds number of the dynamic ﬂow that has
generated the time-averaged ﬁeld. For the higher branch
it varies within 15% of a mean value Rc3
M,kin ∼ 158 (with
no systematic trend in the range explored in our study).
We compare in Fig. 2(b) the evolution of the critical mag-
netic Reynolds numbers. At low RV , we observe that the
dynamo threshold for the dynamical problem lies within
the low RM dynamo window for the time-averaged ﬂow.

3

For RV larger than 200 the dynamical dynamo thresh-
old lies in the immediate vicinity of the upper dynamo
branch (high Rc

M mode of the time-averaged ﬂow).

Let us now compare the structure of the resulting dy-
namo ﬁelds. The magnetic energies and corresponding
integral length scales are shown in Fig.3. For the dy-
namical dynamo, energy is distributed in a broad range
of scales. For the kinematic dynamos evolved from the
time averaged ﬂow, we observe that for the low RM mode
the energy is strongly peaked at large scales, while it is
more evenly distributed in the case of the high RM mode.
This behavior is also reﬂected in the evolution of the inte-
gral magnetic scales, shown in Fig. 3(b). The kinematic
low mode grows a dynamo essentially at scales larger than
the Taylor-Green cell (LB ∼ 1.6π) at all RV ’s. The high
mode on the other hand grows within a TG vortex. The
dynamo selected by the dynamical ﬂow switches between
these two behaviors. At low RV it grows with an inte-
gral scale larger than the TG cell and we observe that
LB,dyn ∼ LB,kin. At high RV the magnetic integral scale
is about half the size of the TG cell. The peak in the
magnetic energy spectrum at smaller scales in the dy-
namic runs, as well as the smaller integral scale, suggest
that turbulent ﬂuctuations can play a role in the dynamo.
This is in agreement with [11], where both large and small
scales were observed to cooperate in the dynamo process:
the growth of small scales allows the dynamo to quench
velocity ﬂuctuations and the magnetic ﬁeld to grow faster
at large scales.

The structure of the dynamos can be explored further
with visualizations of the isosurfaces of the magnetic en-
ergy. Fig.4(a) and (c) correspond respectively to the
low and high kinematic eigenfunctions, while Fig.4(b)
and (d) show the dynamical ﬁelds, with the magnetic

energy rescaled and averaged in time during the linear
hEM (r, t)/EM (t)iT ). Both a low
growth phase (i.e.
(RV = 76.74) and a high (RV = 670) Reynolds num-
ber are shown. One observe a very good correspondence
between the low RV dynamical mode and the kinematic
low eigenfunction; indeed, at low Reynolds number the
ﬂow is laminar with small ﬂuctuations about its mean.
In this regime the dynamo is mainly generated in the
shearing regions in between the TG cells [11, 15]. At
high RV , we compare the dynamical growing dynamo to
the structure of the high RM eigenfunction. In Fig.4(c)
we recognize the ‘twisted banana shape’ structure of the
neutral mode that underlies the α − Ω dynamo of von
K´arm´an ﬂows (recall that at high RV the TG ﬂow in
each cell is very similar to the VK swirling ﬂow) [8, 15].
For the dynamical ﬂow at high RV the TG cells are no
longer as coupled as they are at low RV , and in Fig.4(d)
one does not observe the clear pattern of the kinematic
eigenmode. This can be due to the fact that the mag-
netic energy is displayed here during its initial growth.
As seen in the spectrum– Fig.3(a) – the magnetic energy
grows at all scales; it is only in the non-linear phase that
the magnetic energy is eventually dominated by the large
scales. However, at all RV ’s the dynamo grows predomi-
nantly in the planes π/2 and 3π/2 which cut through the
center of the Taylor-Green cells.

branch as turbulence becomes fully developed), but re-
sults may diﬀer for other types of geometries or ﬂow forc-
ing [16]. However we propose that the observations made
here, particularly in the large RV limit, may have some
relevance for laboratory experiments. For instance, we
ﬁnd that once turbulence is fully developed, the dynamo
threshold is well approximated by the (high branch) kine-
matic value computed using the time averaged ﬂow. This
ﬁnding is in agreement with the observations in the Riga
and Karlsruhe experiments, where the mean ﬂow struc-
ture was optimized to favor dynamo action at low Rc
M .
In addition the threshold reaches a limit value when RV
increases, in agreement with kinematic simulations using
von K´arm´an mean ﬂows measured in the laboratory [8]:
the threshold was observed to be RV independent for
RV exceeding about 105. Hence one may expect that
kinematic predictions based on hydrodynamic measure-
ments in laboratory prototypes can be relevant for exper-
iments. This is also of interest for the numerical study
of natural dynamos where a fully resolved description
of the ﬂuid’s motion in the correct range of parameters
is out of reach [17]. There are however reasons to be
cautious. The main concern lies in the observation that
fully turbulent ﬂows in conﬁned volumes are not station-
ary. Long time dependence in the large scales velocity
ﬂuctuations have been observed [18, 19]. Also, the ef-
fect of turbulent ﬂuctuations on the threshold need fur-
ther study. While recent works have show that a large
scale incoherent noise may increase signiﬁcantly the dy-
namo threshold [20], small scale ﬂuctuations can also be
a source of dynamo action [1, 21].

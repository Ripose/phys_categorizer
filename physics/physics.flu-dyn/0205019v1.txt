Abstract

We report the experimental observation of the α-eﬀect. It consists in the generation of a current

parallel to a magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 applied to a turbulent swirling ﬂow of liquid sodium. At low

magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, we show that the magnitude of the α-eﬀect increases like R2
m

and that its sign is determined by the ﬂow helicity. It saturates and then decreases at large Rm,
primarily because of the expulsion of the applied ﬁeld ~B0 from the bulk of the ﬂow. We show how

this expulsion is aﬀected by the ﬂow geometry by varying the relative amplitudes of the azimuthal

and axial ﬂows.

It has been ﬁrst proposed by Parker that ”cyclonic eddies” in an electrically conducting
ﬂuid may generate a current parallel to an applied magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 [1]. This eﬀect, called

the “α-eﬀect”, has been understood on a more quantitative basis by Steenbeck, Krause

and R¨adler [2] and Moﬀatt [3] in the case of scale separation, i.e. when the magnetic

ﬁeld has a large scale component compared to the scale of the eddies. The α-eﬀect is a

key mechanism of most astrophysical and geophysical dynamo models [3, 4] and is also

involved in the two recent laboratory observations of self-generation of a magnetic ﬁeld by

a ﬂow of liquid sodium: the “Karlsruhe experiment” [5], which is an α2-type dynamo and

the “Riga experiment” [6] which may be understood as an αω-type dynamo [7]. These

experiments, as well as the only direct experimental study of the α-eﬀect [8], involve ﬂows

with geometrical constraints that are chosen in order to maximize the eﬃciency of the

dynamo eﬀect (respectively the α-eﬀect). Several groups are now trying to achieve self-

generation of a magnetic ﬁeld in turbulent ﬂows without, or with less geometrical constraints,

in order to study situations that are closer to astrophysical or geophysical models [9]. It is

thus of primary interest to study the α-eﬀect in such fully developed turbulent ﬂows.

We have measured the induced magnetic ﬁeld ~B generated by a turbulent von K´arm´an
swirling ﬂow of liquid sodium submitted to a transverse external magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 (see Fig.

1). The sodium ﬂow is operated in a loop that has been described elsewhere together with

the details of the experimental set-up [10]. The ﬂow is driven by rotating one of the two

disks of radius R located at position (1) or (2) in a cylindrical vessel, 40 cm in inner diameter

and 40 cm in length. In most experiments presented here, we use a disk of radius R = 150

mm, ﬁtted with 8 straight blades of height h = 10 mm driven at a rotation frequency up

to f = 30 Hz. Four baﬄes, 20 mm in height, have been mounted on the cylindrical vessel

inner wall, parallel to its axis. A turbulent swirling ﬂow with an integral Reynolds number,

Re = 2πR2f /ν, up to 3 ×106 is driven by the rotating disk. The mean ﬂow has the following

characteristics: the ﬂuid is ejected radially outward by the disk; this drives an axial ﬂow

toward the disk along its axis and a recirculation in the opposite direction along the cylinder

lateral boundary. The baﬄes inhibit the azimuthal velocity of the recirculating ﬂow and thus

prevent a global rotation of the ﬂuid. In some experiments, we have used a disk of radius

R = 190 mm, ﬁtted with 16 curved blades of height h = 40 mm, with or without the lateral

baﬄes in order to observe the eﬀect of a stronger azimuthal ﬂow.

Two Helmholtz coils generate a magnetic ﬁeld ~B0, perpendicular to the cylinder axis (see

2

Fig. 1). The three components of the ﬁeld induced by the ﬂow are measured with a 3D Hall
probe, located 180 mm away from the disk in the plane perpendicular to ~B0 and containing

the rotation axis. The probe distance from the rotation axis is adjustable (z = 42, 100, 150

mm).

The equations governing the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0+ ~B(~r, t), where ~B(~r, t) is the magnetic ﬁeld
generated by the ﬂow in the presence of the applied ﬁeld ~B0, are in the MHD approximation,

~∇ · ~B = 0,

~V × ( ~B + ~B0)(cid:17) +
where ~V (~r, t) is the velocity ﬁeld, µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum, and σ is the

ﬂuid electric conductivity.

The reaction of the magnetic ﬁeld on the ﬂow is characterized by the ratio of the Lorentz

force to the characteristic pressure forces driving the ﬂow. This is measured by the inter-

action parameter, N = B2

0/ρµ0U 2, where ρ is the ﬂuid density and U is the characteristic
velocity of the solid boundaries driving the ﬂuid motion. The maximum ﬁeld amplitude

being B0 = 12 G, N is in the range 10−5 − 10−3, thus the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on

the ﬂow is negligible in our experiments. This has been checked directly by measuring the

induced magnetic ﬁeld as a function of the applied one at a constant driving of the ﬂow. We
calculate the mean induced ﬁeld h ~Bi where h·i stands for average in time, as well as its rms
ﬂuctuations in time, ~Brms. Both vary linearly with B0, thus showing that the modiﬁcation
of the velocity ﬁeld ~V in Eq. (2) can be neglected when B0 is increased [10]. Thus, the

only relevant dimensionless parameter of our experiments is the magnetic Reynolds number,

Rm = µ0σRU = 2πµ0σR2f , which is proportional to the rotation frequency f and has been

varied up to 40 for radius of the disks R = 150 mm (respectively 55 for R = 190 mm).

The three components of the mean magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 + h ~B(~r)i, at z = 100 mm above

the rotation axis, are displayed in Fig. 2 as a function of the rotation frequency. We

observe that when the rotation of the disk is reversed, f → −f , we approximately get

(hBxi, hByi, hBzi) → (−hBxi, hByi, −hBzi). When disk (2) is rotated instead of (1) but

keeping f unchanged, we get (hBxi, hByi, hBzi) → (−hBxi, hByi, hBzi) (note that the mea-
surements of ~B are performed in the mid-plane between the two disks). Assuming that

the swirling ﬂow has not broken the symmetries of the driving conﬁguration, the above

3

transformations of the ﬁeld components can be understood using the following symmetry

transformations:

- (i) the symmetry with respect to the vertical plane perpendicular to ~B0, x0z, shows

that if the disk is rotated in the opposite way, f → −f , we get (hBxi, hByi, hBzi) →
(−hBxi, hByi, −hBzi) ( ~B is a pseudovector).

- (ii) The symmetry with respect to the vertical plane parallel to ~B0, y0z, followed by the
transformation ~B0 → − ~B0, shows that when we rotate disk (2) instead of disk (1) without

changing the sign of f , we get (hBxi, hByi, hBzi) → (−hBxi, hByi, hBzi).

The induced ﬁeld component hByi is opposed to ~B0 and increases in amplitude, thus the
total ﬁeld along ~B0 decreases as Rm is increased. This expulsion of a transverse magnetic

ﬁeld from eddies is well documented, both theoretically [11, 12] and experimentally [13].

The expulsion is stronger close to the axis of the cylinder (z = 42 mm). On the contrary,

closer to the cylinder lateral boundary (z = 150 mm), the ﬁeld increases with Rm. Thus,

the ﬁeld is expelled from the core of the swirling ﬂow and concentrates at its periphery.

The components of the ﬁeld induced perpendicular to ~B0 both increase in amplitude

from zero, reach a maximum and then saturate when Rm is increased further. As shown

in Fig. 3, these two components do not scale in the same way at small rotation frequency,

i.e. at small Rm. The amplitude of the vertical component hBzi increases linearly whereas

the axial component hBxi increases quadratically with Rm. Indeed, at the location of the

measurements, we observe hBxi ∝ hBzi2 and hByi ∝ hBzi2, roughly up to f = 10 Hz (see

Fig. 3).

Writing ~B(~r, t) = h ~B(~r)i +~b(~r, t), and similarly for ~V , we get from Eq. (2) for the mean

When the magnetic Reynolds number is small, the ﬁrst source term on the right hand side

of Eq. (3) is the dominant term and we get for each component of the mean induced ﬁeld

hBii ∝ RmB0. However, both the expulsion of a transverse ﬁeld from a rotating eddy and

the α-eﬀect, i.e. the generation of a current parallel to an applied ﬁeld by a cyclonic eddy,

cannot be described at this level and involve the nonlinear source terms of Eq. (3).

Indeed, keeping only the contribution of the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of equation

(4)

The source term being antisymmetric with respect to the vertical plane x0z, we have for the

linear response hBx(x, y = 0, z)i = 0.

The generation of Bx is the consequence of the α-eﬀect, i.e. of the generation of a

current parallel to ~B0. Indeed, at leading order in Rm, hBxi increases like R2
m and its sign
with respect to the sign of B0 is determined by the ﬂow helicity, h = ~V · (~∇ × ~V ) where

the overbar stands for the spatial average. One can easily check that hBxi changes sign

under any symmetry with respect to a plane containing the rotation axis, just as does the

pseudoscalar h.

For ﬁxed Rm, hBxi increases with the distance to the cylinder axis in the range 42 <

z < 150 mm. We can show that it should vanish for z = 0: indeed, the rotation of angle π
around the x-axis followed by the transformation ~B0 → − ~B0 which implies ~B → − ~B, gives

hBx(x, 0, z)i = −hBx(x, 0, −z)i.

When Rm is increased hBxi seems to saturate for z = 100 mm (see Fig.2). Closer to the

rotation axis (z = 42 mm), it reaches a maximum and then decreases roughly to zero when
f is increased up to 30 Hz. This is due to the expulsion of the applied magnetic ﬁeld ~B0

from the core of the swirling ﬂow. Indeed, when the baﬄes are removed from the cylindrical

vessel inner wall, global rotation of the ﬂow is no longer inhibited, and hBxi measured 100

mm away from the rotation axis, decreases to zero at large Rm (see Fig. 4 and compare

with Fig. 2 where hBxi stays ﬁnite at large Rm). Consequently, we observe that the α-

eﬀect decays when Rm is too large, or more precisely when the magnetic Reynolds number

corresponding to the azimuthal ﬂow is too large, because of the transverse ﬁeld expulsion

from the cyclonic eddy. A similar eﬀect has been recently computed by R¨adler et al.

in

the case of the Roberts ﬂow [14]. They have shown by computing terms higher than the

second order in Rm, that the α-eﬀect reaches a maximum and then tends to zero when Rm

is increased further (compare their Fig. 3 with our Fig. 4). Our measurements are the ﬁrst

experimental demonstration that for large Rm the α-eﬀect can vanish due to the geometry

of the ﬂow (i.e. when the amplitude of the azimuthal component of the swirling ﬂow is too

large compared to the axial component).

Using dimensional analysis, we can write

hBx(~r)i = B0 F (~r, Rm, Pm, N),

(5)

where Pm = µ0σν is the magnetic Prandtl number (ν is the kinematic viscosity). As said

above, for B0 small enough, F does not depend on the interaction parameter N. The only

previous experimental study of the α-eﬀect [8] considers a constrained ﬂow conﬁguration in

a range of B0 for which a dependence on N but no dependence on Rm have been found. The

dependence on N can give insights on the nonlinear saturation mechanism of a dynamo gen-

erated via the α-eﬀect. On the contrary, the dependence on Rm determines the dependence

of the linear growth rate of a dynamo generated via the α-eﬀect. The decay of the α-eﬀect

for large Rm reported here, gives a possible mechanism for a “slow dynamo”, i.e. a dynamo

with a growth rate that decreases at large Rm. Finally, the dependence on Pm, or equiva-

lently on the Reynolds number of the ﬂow, cannot be determined from our measurements. In

other words, we do not know the contribution of the turbulent ﬂuctuations to the measured
~hV i × ~hBi(cid:17)
α-eﬀect, i.e. the relative contribution of the two nonlinear source terms ~∇ × (cid:16)
and ~∇ × (cid:16)h~v × ~bi(cid:17) in equation (3). Both the velocity ﬁeld, measured in water [10], and the
magnetic ﬁeld display large ﬂuctuations (roughly 20%), but we cannot evaluate h~v × ~bi. It

would be of great interest to develop a device for simultaneous measurements of magnetic

and velocity ﬁelds, or to perform experiments with diﬀerent liquid metals in order to quan-

tify the eﬀect of Pm. Indeed, the eﬀect of Pm on the induced ﬁelds can give insights in the
problem of the dependence of an α-dynamo threshold, Rc

m, on Pm or equivalently on the

Reynolds number of the ﬂow. The behavior of Rc

m in the limit of large Reynolds number is

an open problem of kinematic dynamo theory and is of prime experimental and theoretical

interest.

Abstract

We explore a possible application of the additive generalization of the Boltzmann-
Gibbs-Shannon entropy proposed in [A. N. Gorban, I. V. Karlin, Phys. Rev. E,
67:016104 (2003)] to fully developed turbulence. The predicted probability distri-
bution functions are compared with those obtained from Tsallis’ entropy and with
experimental data. Consequences of the existence of hidden subsystems are illus-
trated.

1 Introduction

In the past years, a body of experimental data of stationary statistical distribu-
tions has been collected that are not well described by the usual Boltzmann-
Gibbs distribution (see e.g. [1] and references therein). In many cases, the
concept of Tsallis entropy [2] together with the maximum entropy principle
has been found useful to describe these data more accurately [1]. The one-
parametric family of Tsallis’ entropies is deﬁned as

Sq =

1

i

− Pi pq
q
1
−

,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where q > 0 is the so-called nonextensivity parameter. If a system consists of
two statistically independent subsystems then Tsallis’ entropy of this system
is not equal to the sum of the Tsallis’ entropies of the subsystems for q
= 1.
The additivity is recovered only in the limit q
1, where Tsallis’ entropy (1)
reduces to the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy S1,

Since Tsallis’ entropy is postulated rather than derived, this point is open to
discussion [3,4].

Very recently, two of the present authors have derived a unique trace–form
extension of the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy to ﬁnite systems
that is still additive under joining statistically independent subsystems [5],

up to adding a constant and multiplying by a constant factor. It is shown in
Ref. [5] that the maximum entropy principle applied to this extensive general-
ized entropy results in non-exponential tails of probability distributions which
are not accessible within classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy (see also
Refs. [6] and [7]). The present paper provides an application of the additive

generalized entropies (4) to experimental data on fully developed turbulence,
where non-exponential tails of probability distributions have been observed
[8,9]. We also present consequences of incomplete description or hidden sub-
systems discussed in Ref. [5]. Limitations of such an approach are discussed
in Ref. [10].

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy present the approach
of Ref. [8] based on Tsallis’ entropy and contrast it to the alternative approach
based on the additive entropies (4). In Section 3, we compare the results of
the two approaches for describing the experimental data of Refs. [8,9].

2 Maximum Entropy and Generalized Probability Densities

The maximum entropy principle under suitable constraints can be used to
derive many relevant statistical distributions in physics but also in a wide
range of other problems such as image reconstruction and time series analysis
(see e.g. A. R. Plastino in [1] and references therein). Using only conserved
quantities as constraints, the corresponding maximum entropy distributions
describe equilibrium situations while the use of non-conserved quantities as
constraints oﬀers access to time-dependent processes.

Consider a system with continuous state variable u, which is characterized by
the energy ǫ(u). Let p(u) denote the probability density of state u. Extremizing
the entropy functional S[p] subject to the constraint of ﬁxed normalization

du p(u) = 1 and ﬁxed total energy

du p(u)ǫ(u) = E, leads to

R

R

δS[p]
δp(u)

= λ0 + βǫ(u),

where δ/δp denotes the Volterra functional derivative and λ0 and β are La-
grange multipliers that satisfy the constraints of ﬁxed normalization and total
energy, respectively. Thus, β can be interpreted as a suitable inverse tem-
perature. The solution to Eq. (5) gives the relevant or maximum entropy
distribution consistent with the constraints.

In case of Tsallis’ entropy (1), the solution to Eq. (5) are the probability
distributions [11]

Before proceeding to a speciﬁc example, we brieﬂy address the problem of
incomplete description as presented in Sec. V. of Ref. [5]. Incomplete descrip-
tion in this context means, that in addition to p other components or hidden
subsystems g(p) exist, whose entropy has to be taken into account. Deﬁne the

3 Results for Fully Developed Turbulent Flows

The authors of Ref. [8] studied velocity diﬀerences of high Reynolds number
ﬂow in a Taylor-Couette apparatus. For suﬃciently small distances, the exper-
imentally observed probability distribution function of the velocity diﬀerences
clearly shows non-exponential tails.

In order to apply Eqs. (6) and (8) to this system, the expression for the energy
ǫ has to be speciﬁed appropriately. In Ref. [8], the energy ǫ(u) is assumed to
be given by

ǫ(u) =

where the skewness c and the intermittency parameter ζ are related to Tsallis’
q-parameter by c√τ γ = 0.124(q
q, respectively. Thus, only
one independent parameter q is left. Beck oﬀers in Ref. [12] some arguments
in favor of Eq. (12) for the case ζ = 1, while the extension to ζ
= 1 in Ref. [8]
is done in analogy to turbulence modeling.

For the distribution functions (8), the parameter α needs to be speciﬁed. Re-
member, that the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy is recovered for

eralized entropy (4). We suggest that the parameters q and α, describing the
deviation from the classical Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy are related by
1)ν with some exponent ν. Since the parameters q and α describe
α = (q
the non-ergodicity of the phase space dynamics, this relation might be inter-
preted in terms of excluded volume in phase space. Below, we use this simple
power law relation as a plausible mapping between the parameters of both the
theories.

Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the probability distribution functions (6) and
(8) with the energy given by (12). The values of the nonextensivity parameter
q are the same as used in Ref. [8]. For comparison with Eq. (8), exactly the
same expressions for the energy, the parameters ζ, β and c are used. We
also choose exactly the same values for q as done in Ref. [8]. Thus, the only
parameter left is the exponent ν, relating Tsallis’ nonextensivity parameter q
to α. The same value ν = 2.25 has been chosen in all cases to determine the
parameter α in Eq. (8). On a linear scale, Fig. 1 (a), the curves pq and p∗
α are
almost indistinguishable by the naked eye. On a logarithmic scale however,
diﬀerences between these curves are seen to become important for u & 4. As
mentioned above, the asymptotic behavior of p∗
α, Eq. (8), is independent of α,
while the decay of pq, Eq. (6), can be varied by varying q. Thus, it appears
the the distribution functions (6) describe the experimental data of Ref. [8]

better than Eq. (8). We like to mention, however, that we made no attempt
to improve the agreement of the distribution functions (8) with Eq. (6) by
varying the relations between the parameters ζ, β, c and q.

In Ref. [13], Beck provides a comparison of Eq. (6) to the experimental results
of La Porta et al., [9]. In the latter experiment, the acceleration of a test
particle in a fully developed turbulent ﬂow was measured. If the acceleration a
is interpreted as velocity diﬀerence on the smallest time scale of the turbulent
ﬂow (Kolmogorov time scale), the previous consideration apply also to this
experiment with the identiﬁcation u = a/qh
. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of
the experimental results [9] to the formulas (6) and (8) with q = 1.49, ζ = 0.92,
β = 4 and c = 0, which are the values of the parameters proposed in [13]. As
noted in Ref. [13], Eq. (6) with this choice of parameters provides a very good
description of the experimental results. The distribution function (8) with
the same values of parameters, however, overestimates the tails signiﬁcantly
already at u & 1. The same value ν = 2.25 as before was chosen. Fig. 2 also
shows the result of numerical solutions to Eq. (10) for t = µ = 0.5 where
all other parameters remain unchanged. Fig. 2 demonstrates that inclusion of
a single hidden subsystem decreases the tails of the probability distribution.
In the present case, this decrease leads to an improved comparison with the
. 3. By including more hidden subsystems, a
experimental data in a range
systematic improvement in the description of the experimental data is possible.

4 Conclusions

We have presented an application of the additive generalization of the Boltzmann-
Gibbs-Shannon entropy presented in Ref. [5] to experimental data in fully de-
veloped turbulence [8,9]. We found good agreement between the generalized
distributions and the experimental data when compared on a linear scale.
On a logarithmic scale, however, discrepancies in the tails of the distribution
functions are evident. In particular, the generalized distributions overpredict
the tails in comparison with experiments. Improved experimental results pre-
sented very recently in Ref. [14] seem to indicate that the tails of the probabil-
ity distribution do not obey a power law behavior. Thus, it appears that the
maximum entropy distributions obtained either from Tsallis’ or from the gen-
eralized additive entropy do not describe the tails of the distribution correctly,
at least for the experimental results of [9,14].

It should be mentioned, that we used the same values of parameters that give
very good agreement to the power-law distributions obtained from Tsallis’
entropy and made no attempt to optimize this choice for the new distribution
functions obtained from the generalized additive entropies. Rather then trying
to improve the ﬁt of the experimental data by choosing diﬀerent values of

6

the parameters, we illustrate the consequences of incomplete description. We
found that the inclusion of the entropy of a single hidden subsystem helps
to improve the comparison to the experimental data signiﬁcantly. Systematic
improvements by including more hidden subsystems is straightforward.

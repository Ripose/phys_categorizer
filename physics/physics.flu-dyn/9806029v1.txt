ABSTRACT

In this paper we consider the properties of the inter-
nal partitions of the nonlinear term, obtained when a ﬁlter
with a sharp cutoﬀ is introduced in wavenumber space. We
see what appears to be some degree of independence of the
choice of the position of the cutoﬀ wavenumber for both
instantaneous and time-integrated partitioned nonlineari-
ties. We also investigate the basic idea of an eddy-viscosity
model for subgrid terms and have found that while phase
modelling will be very poor, amplitude modelling can be
far more successful.

INTRODUCTION

As is well known, full numerical simulation of any sig-
niﬁcant turbulent ﬂow lies far beyond the scope of cur-
rent computational resources, the main problem being the
large number of degrees of freedom involved in the prob-
lem. As these degrees of freedom may be represented by,
for instance, the number of independently excited modes in
wavenumber space, the problem becomes one of eliminat-
ing modes, in some statistical sense, in order to bring the
reduced number of degrees of freedom within the capacity
of current (or even future) computers. One such way by
which we may systematically obtain such a reduction in the
number of modes is by the use of a Renormalization Group
(RG) calculation. A general account of the background to
this work has been given in the review by McComb (1995).
In this study, we are undertaking direct numerical sim-
ulations (DNS) of homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible
turbulence in a box with periodic boundary conditions, in
order to assess the underlying feasibility of using RG to
reduce the size of the computational problem. We have
already reported some results on the use of conditional av-
erages (McComb et al. 1997, Machiels 1997) as previously
formulated by McComb et al (1992) and McComb and
Watt (1992). In the present paper we concentrate on the
Hilbert space partitions of the nonlinear terms and their
ﬁltered projections in order to assess the appropriateness of
the ‘eddy viscosity’ concept. Results of this study should
have direct relevance to large eddy simulations (LES) in
general, as well as to RG.

ary turbulence,

where u(k, t) is the velocity ﬁeld in Fourier-space, ν is the
kinematic viscosity, Mαβγ(k) is given by

Mαβγ(k) = (2i)

−1 [kβDαγ (k) + kγ Dαβ(k)] ,

where

Dαβ(k) = δαβ −

kαkβ
|k|2

and f (k, t) is a forcing term used to achieve stationarity.
We may rewrite equation (1) in a highly symbolic form as

L0u = M uu + f .

The nonlinear term (M uu in our shorthand notation)
may be partitioned by introducing a cutoﬀ at k = k1

and deﬁning u
α (k, t) for
0 < k < k1 and uα(k, t) = u+
α (k, t) for k1 < k < k0. The
maximum cutoﬀ wavenumber, k0, is of the same order of
magnitude as the Kolmogorov dissipation wavenumber and
is deﬁned via the dissipation integral,

We have carried out direct numerical simulations to cal-
culate ψ- and φ-ﬁelds in order to investigate their proper-
ties.

NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

We started from an existing, well validated code for
the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence, con-
structed at the University of Edinburgh and running on the
Cray T3D administered by the Edinburgh Parallel Com-
puting Centre. In Figure 1 we have plotted a number of
the standard DNS outputs generated by our code, running
on a 2563 grid.

For the fundamentals of direct numerical simulations,
the reader is directed to the pioneering work of Orszag
(1969 and 1971). Time integration is performed by way
of a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme and partial dealias-
ing is achieved through application of a random-shifting
method (see, for example, Rogallo, 1981). At each time-
step, the nonlinear term, ψ, is calculated by a pseudospec-
tral method involving a number of fast Fourier transforms.
and ψ++ may be computed by carrying out the same
ψ
procedure having ﬁrst zeroed the u+ and u
ﬁelds respec-
−+ may be calculated simply by subtracting
tively while ψ

and ψ++ from the total nonlinear term.

with E(k, t) deﬁned as the energy spectrum. kf is chosen
to be 1.5 so that the forcing is applied to only the ﬁrst shell
of wavenumbers. With this forcing, we have observed over
many simulations that after a suﬃcient number of time
steps the velocity ﬁeld reaches a statistically stationary
form, as desired.

Computing the φ-ﬁelds

The evolution of φ and its partitions, as deﬁned in equa-
tions (13)–(16), is a costly exercise as it must be performed
in parallel with the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld. We use a
simple trapezoidal method to carry out the necessary time
integrals, but the need to calculate each of the partitions
of ψ at each time step leads to a code that is roughly three
times as computationally expensive as a straightforward
DNS.

Further problems arise out of the necessity to choose
suitable initial φ-ﬁelds with which to begin the computa-
tion. Here, we have chosen to begin by zeroing each of the
φ-ﬁelds for all values of k, in the expectation that after a
suﬃcient number of time steps the initial conditions will
have been forgotten. To this end, we run the DNS code un-
til the four φ-ﬁelds have reached a statistically stationary
state, and assume that this indicates convergence to their
true values. Further evidence may be provided by keeping
in mind the fact that our forcing is only being applied to
a single shell in wavenumber space, so that we have

u = φ for kf < k < k0.

We note that h|u|2i ≈ h|φ|2i from our evolved data but
carry out an additional test by computing the correlation
between the two ﬁelds. We deﬁne the general correlation
between two ﬁelds, a and b, by

R(a, b; k) =

haα(k)bα(−k)i
h|a(k)|2i1/2h|b(k)|2i1/2

and plot R(u, φ; k) in Figure 2 for six diﬀerent time steps.
We see that by the ﬁnal time step, the level of correlation
is excellent for k > 5 and good for k > 1. The increasing
quality of correlation with increasing k is to be expected as
a consequence of the fact that higher wavenumbers evolve
at a greater rate than lower wavenumbers — something
which is borne out by looking at the correlations computed
at earlier time steps. The deviation in the ﬁrst shell is to
be expected as this is outside the valid range of equation
(19).

Finally we note that in order to compute φ-ﬁelds for
diﬀerent cutoﬀ wavenumbers, k1, we must reperform the
entire DNS from initial conditions up to the fully evolved
state.

Experimental Details

We have computed ψ-ﬁelds for a number of diﬀerent cut-
oﬀ wavenumbers at resolutions of 643 and 2563 grid points.
The high cost of calculating the φ-ﬁelds means that for
these we have been restricted to a resolution of 643 grid
points and only two cutoﬀ wavenumbers.

Our 643 simulation achieved a microscale Reynolds num-

ber of Rλ ≈ 70 while our 2563 simulation reached Rλ ≈
190.

RESULTS

Low Reynolds Number

The results given in this section correspond to our 643
simulation. We begin by presenting results for the φ-
ﬁelds with cutoﬀ wavenumbers k1 = 16.5 and k1 = 24.5.
Throughout this work, the cutoﬀ wavenumbers are chosen
to be half-integers so that they lie between two distinct
shells. For each data set, we compute the correlation be-
tween φ and each of its partitions using equation (20) and
also a measure of their relative magnitudes, r(k), given by

r(a, b; k) =

h|b(k)|2i
h|a(k)|2i

.

Results are plotted in Figures 3 and 4, with both func-
tions plotted against k/k1. We ﬁrst note that, once scaled
in this way, the exact choice of k1 seems to have little eﬀect

behaviour observed for k/k1 < 0.5 in Figure 3 is an eﬀect
caused by the presence of the forcing term.

The general picture which seems to emerge from both
correlation and magnitude information, is that for k < k1,
partition is the dominant part of φ. For k > k1, it
the φ
−+ which is dominant while φ++ is broadly insigniﬁcant
is φ
for all values of k.

It was at this point in our work that it became appar-
ent that the computational cost involved in calculating the
φ-ﬁelds was too high and so attention was turned to the
ψ-ﬁelds which are far easier to calculate. For these, a sin-
gle velocity ﬁeld realization is enough to calculate ψ and
its partitions for any cutoﬀ wavenumber, k1. We begin by
duplicating the calculations performed on the φ-ﬁelds for
the same resolution grid, and for the same cutoﬀ wavenum-
bers. Results are shown in Figures 5 and 6 where we see a
very similar picture to that presented in Figures 3 and 4.
Taking advantage of the reduction in computational ef-
−−
; k) for a number of diﬀer-
fort, we now compute R(ψ, ψ
ent cutoﬀ wavenumbers. The results are shown in Figure 7.
We see ﬁrst of all that there is an excellent collapse of data
for all cutoﬀs considered and that there is good correlation
between ψ and ψ
below the cutoﬀ. Above the cutoﬀ,
this correlation decays rapidly away to zero. We also note
that, mathematically, ψ−−(k) = 0 for k > 2k1 so that the
occurrence of a non-zero correlation in this region points
to the existence of small numerical and aliasing errors.
This picture is reversed when we consider R(ψ, ψ

−+; k)
as shown in Figure 8. The collapse of data is not so good,
particularly in the low-wavenumber region, and we see that
as k/k1 increases, the correlation begins to tail away from
unity.

−−

A pattern is even more diﬃcult to discern when we com-
pute R(ψ, ψ++; k), shown in Figure 9. We see that overall,
ψ++ does not correlate well with ψ, although the level of
correlation increases with k/k1 as we move beyond the cut-
oﬀ.

Moderate Reynolds Number

We now extend our work by applying the ideas outlined
in previous sections to ψ-ﬁeld data from our 2563 simula-
tions. Figures 10–12 show correlations of ψ with each of its
partitions from this data. As can be easily seen, the picture
has changed very little from our 643 data, the biggest dif-
ference being that the results seem better behaved, which
is expected due to there being more data points available
for shell averaging in the region k < k1.

In the following sections, all results are generated using

the ψ-ﬁelds taken from our 2563 simulation.

Eddy-viscosities with Sharp Cutoﬀs

We begin by rewriting our Navier-Stokes equation (6) for

the low-wavenumber modes as

L0u< = ψ

−−

< + ψ(−−)

< + f<

where the subscript ‘<’ indicates that we are only con-
cerned with k < k1 and where

ψ(−−) = ψ

−+ + ψ++.

In a large eddy simulation, wavenumbers k > k1 will not
be available and so we introduce some model for ψ(−−)
which we will denote ˜ψ(−−)
is
an eddy-viscosity model, whereby

based around the idea of our wavenumber cutoﬀs intro-
duced in previous sections.

We can now compute the correlation between the ex-
act subgrid terms and the model, R(ψ(−−)
; k). Be-
cause of ˜ψ(−−)
’s relationship with u — and assuming only
that δν(k) is positive for all values of k — this is equal
to R(ψ(−−)
, −u<; k). The results are plotted in Figure
13. We see immediately that the correlation is, in general,
quite poor. We also see what appears to be a diﬀerence in
behaviour between cutoﬀs k1 ≥ 48.5 where there appears
to be some degree of universality and cutoﬀs k1 ≤ 32.5.
In general, however, we can state quite categorically that,
for the case of a sharp cutoﬀ in wavenumber space, no
eddy-viscosity model (subject to the reasonable constraint
δν(k) ≥ 0) can perfectly reproduce the missing nonlinear
terms. But, as we shall see, our conclusion will be modiﬁed
somewhat when we consider phase and amplitude informa-
tion separately.

Returning to equation (22), we can generate an energy
balance equation by multiplying through by u< and aver-
aging. Multiplying this through by 2πk2 then gives,

ing at least one high-wavenumber mode. W< is the energy
input due to the forcing. For interest’s sake, the two en-

ergy transfer functions are plotted in Figure 14. We see
that T −− has a large negative value in the ﬁrst shell (note
that the y-axis has been truncated for this graph) corre-
sponding to transfer of energy away from the energy input
(forcing). We also see that T
is piling up energy at the
cutoﬀ and that this is balanced by T (−−) which carries it
to the higher wavenumbers.

Comparing equations (25) and (26) we can easily derive a

(27)

For a large eddy simulation, this would ordinarily have to
be estimated by use of some model, as the whole point of
LES is the absence of the high-wavenumber modes neces-
sary for the calculation of T (−−)
. However, with DNS data
we can calculate this, and the results are plotted in Figure
15.

The general form of these eddy-viscosities appears to be
in good agreement with the form obtained theoretically by,
for example, Kraichnan (1976) and we know from previous
work (see, for example, Lesieur and Rogallo, 1989) and our
own LES experiments that this particular model provides
good results. We must now ask why this is, when it is in
apparent contradiction with the results presented in Figure
13.

Separating out Phase and Amplitude Eﬀects

In this section we look at what happens if we separate
our data into those contributions due to phase and those
contributions due to amplitude. For each point in our ﬁeld
given by the wavevector, k, we choose some unit vector
perpendicular to k which we call ˆn. We may then generate
a transverse component of the velocity ﬁeld,

uT = u·ˆn.

(28)

We note that uT provides us with a statistically complete
picture of our system. This is because, through continuity,
uL, the component parallel to k will be zero and due to
isotropy, the statistical properties of uT are independent
of the exact choice of ˆn.

Since we are working in Fourier space, uT will be a com-

plex scalar and so may be rewritten in the form

uT = ureiuθ ,

(29)

and similarly for our ψ-ﬁelds. We may now consider cor-
relations based solely on phase or amplitude information
(note that as we are now working with scalar ﬁelds, equa-
tion (20) must be modiﬁed by the removal of the sum over
components, α).

In Figures 16—18 we have plotted correlations corre-
sponding to Figures 10–12 but concerning ourselves only
with phase information. We see a picture which is largely
similar to that seen when considering all parts of the ψ-
ﬁelds, but note that in places — most obviously for k > k1
−+ data — the correlations are less good.
in the ψ
Moving on to Figures 19—21, where we have consid-
ered only amplitude information, we see a diﬀerent picture.
Here, while the regions of excellent correlation remain more
or less untouched, for the rest of the data we see that the
level of correlation does not drop below about 0.75 and
indeed seems to remain approximately constant at some
value between 0.75 and 0.80.

We can shed some light on the reasons for this by con-
sidering the statistical nature of the ψ-ﬁelds. In Figures 22
and 23 we plot probability distribution functions for the
amplitude and phase components respectively for each of
the ψ-ﬁelds1. We see that the possible values of the ampli-
tude components are localised and similar in shape (in fact,
−−
for the chosen value of k < k1, the PDF’s for ψr and ψ
r
are almost indistinguishable) and hence amplitude correla-
tions will be good. On the other hand, there is no preferred
phase and hence phase correlations will be very poor.

We now carry these ideas across to the analysis of general
eddy viscosity models outlined in a previous section. Recall
the deﬁnition of ˜ψ(−−)
< — we can now
compare the phase and amplitude components of these two
ﬁelds separately.

as a model for ψ(−−)

<

In Figure 24 we present the correlation obtained from
phase information only and see that the general picture
is the same as when we considered the whole ﬁelds.
In
Figure 25, however, where we consider only amplitude in-
formation, we see that there is uniformly good correlation
at a level of around 0.75.

This means that the poor correlation between the ex-
act subgrid terms and an eddy-viscosity model is due al-
most entirely to mismatching phases. However, by choos-
ing δν(k) suitably, it is possible to provide a good match
as far as amplitude is concerned.

CONCLUSION

We have seen that, for the range of cutoﬀ wavenum-
bers considered here, there is some degree of universal be-
haviour when we consider the partitions of the nonlinear
term. We see that for k < k1, the terms involving coupling
between low-wavenumber modes dominate, and this is a
useful property when considering the potential for large
eddy simulations. We have also seen that while it is not
possible to represent subgrid terms exactly using an eddy-
viscosity model, it is possible to model the amplitude of
these terms. This will lead to reasonable results when one
considers, for example, the ﬂow of energy but it is clear
that on a more fundamental level the velocity ﬁeld will
become corrupted due to phase-errors.

1We note that, strictly, these are not PDFs as our data set in
this instance is insuﬃciently large — we would expect the true
PDF of the phase components to be ﬂat, for example. What we
have instead is a measure of the distribution of that data which
we do have.

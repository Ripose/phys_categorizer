It is widely believed that at high Reynolds number (Re) all turbulent ﬂows approach a state of
“fully developed turbulence” deﬁned by a unique, Re-independent statistics of the velocity ﬂuctua-
tions. Yet direct measurements of the velocity ﬂuctuations have failed to yield clear-cut empirical
evidence of the existence of fully developed turbulence. Here we relate the friction coeﬃcient (f ) of
rough-conduit ﬂows to the statistics of the velocity ﬂuctuations. In light of experimental measure-
ments of f , our results yield unequivocal evidence of the existence of fully developed turbulence.

Turbulence is the unrest that spontaneously takes over
a streamline ﬂow when the ﬂow is made suﬃciently fast.
A conspicuous manifestation of this unrest, and one that
lends itself readily to theoretical analysis, is the advent of
ﬂuctuations in the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂow. In a classic
paper [1], Kolmog´orov made a few plausible assumptions
to show that in ﬂows of high mean velocity (or high Re)
the statistics of the velocity ﬂuctuations should become
asymptotically invariant to further increases in the mean
velocity. The universal turbulent state deﬁned by the
limiting statistics of the velocity ﬂuctuations was termed
“fully developed turbulence,” and its existence has be-
come a widely held belief. Support for this belief has been
sought in direct, hot-wire measurements of the velocity
ﬂuctuations; yet, as recent research has shown [2, 3, 4, 5],
the results remain inconclusive. In this Letter, we seek
to prove the existence of fully developed turbulence by
harnessing empirical evidence other than the direct mea-
surement of the velocity ﬂuctuations. We start with an
outline of the intricacies of the problem.

Kolmog´orov studied the statistics of the velocity ﬂuc-
tuation at the lengthscale l, ul. He used dimensional
analysis to show that the structure function (ul)2 (i.e.,
the mean value of (ul)2) must take the form [1]

(ul)2 = P [Re, l/L] (εl)2/3,

(1)

≫

where P is a dimensionless function of the dimension-
less variables Re and l/L, Re
1 is a Reynolds number
of the ﬂow, L is the largest lengthscale in the ﬂow, ε is
the mean value of the rate of energy dissipation per unit
mass, and l is conﬁned to the inertial range, L
η,
where η is the viscous (dissipation) lengthscale [6]. Given
1, it is natural to identify a

that Re
plausible asymptotic scenario for Re
0.
To that end, Kolmog´orov assumed complete similarity
with respect to Re and l/L, or limRe→∞ liml/L→0 P = p,
where p > 0 is a constant prefactor [7]. Under this as-
sumption, the leading term in the asymptotic expansion
lt = p (εl)2/3 (where the subscript “lt”
of (ul)2 is (ul)2
stands for leading term), which is independent of Re,
and may therefore be said to deﬁne a universal limiting

1—the state of fully developed turbu-
state for Re
lence [8]. Shortly after the publication of Kolmog´orov’s
paper in 1941, it was objected that the asymptotic sce-
nario proposed by Kolmog´orov, and customarily known
as K41, could not account for intermittency—a phe-
nomenon whereby the rate of energy dissipation per unit
mass ﬂuctuates around its mean value, ε [9]. To account
for intermittency, Kolmog´orov himself argued that the
similarity with respect to l/L might be incomplete, and
went on to assume the simplest type of incomplete simi-
larity with respect to l/L [7]. Under this assumption, the
lt = p (εl)2/3(l/L)α, where
leading term of (ul)2 is (ul)2
α is a constant intermittency exponent [10]. This alter-
native asymptotic scenario, known as K62, has led to a
vast body of research on intermittency [9]. Nevertheless,
in K62 (ul)2
lt remains independent of Re, as was the case
in K41, and therefore continues to deﬁne a universal lim-
In this sense, K62 represents
iting state for Re
only a minor departure from K41. More recently, a ma-
jor departure from K41 has been suggested on the basis
of new experimental results [2, 3]. These results indicate
that even at very high Re the prefactor p is not constant,
but subject to a discernible dependence on Re—a depen-
dence that is marked enough as to cast doubts on the
existence of fully developed turbulence. To analyze these
results, Barenblatt and Goldenfeld [4] argued that there
might be no similarity with respect to Re. Further, they
argued that the form of the structure function at high
Re should be invariant under a natural redeﬁnition of Re
[11], and showed that for this principle of asymptotic co-
variance to hold the structure function (and therefore p)
must depend on Re only through ln Re. Last, they wrote
p(ln Re) = p0 + p1δ + o(δ), where δ

Barenblatt and Goldenfeld computed best ﬁts of (2) to
hot-wire data from a large wind tunnel and the atmo-
sphere [2], both for p0 > 0 and p0 = 0, and concluded
that the data were “not inconsistent with either of the
two possibilities” [4]. In another attempt at deciding the
matter, Sreenivasan [5] studied a large set of hot-wire
data, and concluded that the prefactor p is “more or less
universal, essentially independent of the ﬂow as well as
the Reynolds number” [14]. Nevertheless, he noted that
the scatter in the data was large, and that to evince the
behavior of p at high Re one would have “to cover a wide
range of Reynolds numbers in a single, well-controlled
ﬂow, and use instrumentation whose resolving power and
quality remains equally good in the entire range;” unfor-
tunately, “such experiments and eﬀorts are not yet in the
horizon at present” [5]. To decide the matter, we intend
to resort to experimental data on the friction coeﬃcient
of rough conduits, f . These data (e.g., [15]) appear to
be well suited to our purpose: they contain very little
scatter and show beyond doubt that, for any ﬁxed wall
roughness, the leading term of f is independent of Re at
high Re. Further, the observed dependence of the lead-
ing term of f on the roughness is described accurately
by a well-known empirical formula. The only problem,
to which we turn presently, is how to relate f to (ul)2.

The friction coeﬃcient of a conduit of circular cross-

shear stress on the wall of the conduit, ρ the density of
the liquid ﬂowing through the conduit, and V the aver-
age velocity of the ﬂow. We seek to obtain an expression
relating f to the structure function of (2). Now (2) was
originally derived under the assumptions of isotropy and
homogeneity, but the turbulent ﬂow in a conduit is both
anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Nevertheless, recent re-
search [16] has established that (2) applies as well to ﬂows
that are neither isotropic nor homogeneous. Further, if
vl denotes the characteristic velocity of a turbulent eddy
(ul)2, where (ul)2 is
of size l, we may identify vl =
given by (2) with L = D (the diameter of the conduit,
which sets the largest lengthscale in the ﬂow) ([9], chap.
7). Thus, it follows from (2) that, regardless of the value
of p0, the smaller the eddy the lower its velocity. With
these considerations in mind, we now seek to derive an
expression for τ , the shear stress on the rough wall of the
conduit.

Let us call S the wetted surface tangent to the peaks of
the roughness elements of the wall, Fig. 1. (We assume
roughness elements of uniform size r, as in Nikuradse’s
experiments [15].) Then, for Re

eﬀected by momentum transfer across S. Above S, the

a high horizontal momentum per unit volume (
ρV ).
Below S, the velocity of the ﬂow is negligible, and the
ﬂuid carries a negligible horizontal momentum per unit
volume. Now consider an eddy that straddles the wet-
ted surface S (one half of the eddy is above S, the other
half below). This eddy transfers ﬂuid of high horizontal
momentum downwards across S, and ﬂuid of negligible
horizontal momentum upwards across S. The net rate of
momentum transfer across S is set by the velocity nor-
mal to S, which velocity is provided by the eddies that
straddle S. Therefore, if vn denotes the velocity nor-
mal to S provided by the dominant eddy that straddles
S, then the shear stress eﬀected by momentum transfer
ρ V vn. Now the size of
across S scales in the form τ
the largest eddy that straddles S scales with r, the size
of the roughness elements. This eddy provides a veloc-
(ur)2 normal to S, where (ur)2 is given by (2)

To complete our derivation, we relate ε to V and D
using the phenomenological theory, which is based on
two tenets pertaining to the steady production of tur-
bulent (kinetic) energy: (1) The production occurs at
the lengthscale of the largest eddies in the ﬂow and (2)
The rate of production is independent of the viscosity.
From these tenets and the equality of production and
dissipation, it follows that we can obtain a scaling ex-
pression for ε, the rate of dissipation of turbulent energy
per unit mass of liquid, in terms of the velocity of the
largest eddies (which

From the previous paragraph, we conclude that equa-
tion (3) together with the experimental data embodied
by Strickler’s empirical expression allows us to establish
that p0 > 0. Therefore, the leading term of the structure
function (ul)2 is independent of Re, and the universal
limiting state known as fully developed turbulence exists
at high Reynolds numbers.

The logic of our reasoning so far has been the follow-
ing. We have shown theoretically that in a rough con-
duit limRe→∞ f = 0 unless p0 > 0.
In other words,
we have shown that p0 > 0 is a necessary condition
for the friction coeﬃcient of a rough conduit to tend
to a positive constant at high Re. Then, given the un-
equivocal experimental evidence that in a rough conduit
limRe→∞ f = const > 0, we have concluded that it must
be that p0 > 0. Interestingly, p0 > 0 is not in general a

suﬃcient condition for the friction coeﬃcient of a con-
duit to tend to a positive constant at high Re: the conduit
must be rough. To elucidate this statement, we recall our
scaling expression for the shear stress, τ
ρvrV . This
expression indicates that the momentum transfer is dom-
inated by the eddies of size r—the same size as the rough-
ness elements. Now in a rough-conduit ﬂow of suﬃciently
high Re, r exceeds the viscous lengthscale, r > η. In fact,
ν3/4ε−1/4 (where ν is the kinematic viscosity)

and ε
and conclude that for any given r the condition r > η
holds at suﬃciently high Re. If Re is increased further,
η lessens and newer, smaller eddies populate the ﬂow
and become jumbled with the older eddies. Yet the mo-
mentum transfer continues to be dominated by eddies of
size r, and f remains invariant. This argument explains
the behavior of f for all rough conduits, no matter how
small the the roughness elements. If r = 0, however, the
condition r > η cannot be attained, even at extremely
high Re. Thus in a smooth conduit [21] the momentum
transfer will always be dominated by the smaller eddies
in the inertial range, whose size scales with η; since η
lessens as Re increases, the momentum transfer will be
dominated by ever smaller eddies as Re increases, and
limRe→∞ f = 0—even though p0 > 0, and the turbu-
lence will be fully developed at high Re. To verify this
conclusion mathematically, we study (3) for r
η. By

In accord with our discussion above, (4) indicates that in
a smooth conduit the friction coeﬃcient vanishes asymp-
totically at high Re, whether p0 = 0 or p0 > 0. Had we
to decide between p0 = 0 and p0 > 0 on the basis of (4)
and experimental data, the answer would not be clear-
cut, because (ln Re)−1/2 varies but very slowly at high
Re. Nevertheless, we have established previously that

From the previous paragraph, we conclude that if p0 >

In a recent monograph [22], Tsinober has drawn a dis-
tinction between “possibly universal properties of small
scale turbulence” and “quantitative universal properties
of turbulence at high Re” [14]. The former were ﬁrst envi-
sioned in the early history of turbulence physics; they are
embodied by the asymptotic scenarios of Kolmog´orov,
K41 and K62, that deﬁne the possibly universal limit-
ing state of fully developed turbulence. The latter have

6

long been known to engineers; they are manifest in a few
properties of turbulent ﬂows that become independent
of Re at high Re, including the drag of bluﬀ bodies and
the friction coeﬃcient of rough conduits, among others
[23]. Here we have established a relation between the two
[24]. In particular, we have found that the existence of
fully developed turbulence is a necessary condition for the
friction coeﬃcient of rough conduits to tend to positive
constants at high Re, as seen in experiments. In addi-
tion, we have found that the existence of fully developed
turbulence is compatible with the experimental evidence
that the friction coeﬃcient of smooth conduits tends to
zero at high Re. On the basis of our ﬁndings, fully de-
veloped turbulence may be termed a “universal property
of small scale turbulence,” without qualiﬁcation.

[11] For example, the form of the structure function should
not change if we used the Taylor microscale Reynolds
number, Reλ, in lieu of a global Re.

[12] Barenblatt and Goldenfeld also assumed a general type
of incomplete similarity with respect to l/L in which the
intermittency exponent, α, may depend on Re [7]. Then,
in keeping with the principle of asymptotic covariance,
they wrote α(ln Re) = α0 + α1/ ln Re + o(1/ ln Re), and
pointed out that the experimental data of Praskovsky
and Oncley [2] favor the case α0 = 0, which implies
that α tends to zero at high Re. Since α is of slight
concern here, we continue to represent it as a constant.
Nevertheless, in all our equations α may be substituted
by α0 + α1/ ln Re + o(1/ ln Re). Note that our conclu-
sions do not depend on the satisfaction of the principle
of asymptotic covariance; in fact, they would still hold

[13] Note that if p0 > 0 and p1 6= 0 we continue to say that
fully developed turbulence exists, even though the struc-
ture function depends on Re, and the state of fully de-
veloped turbulence can be attained only asymptotically.
This scenario has been termed “asymptotic Kolmog´orov
scaling.” Given that K41 was predicated on the asymp-
totic condition Re ≫ 1, we believe that in its original for-
mulation K41 was not meant to imply anything stronger
than asymptotic Kolmog´orov scaling. Hence, we charac-
terize K41 and K62 as “asymptotic scenarios.”

to these authors, for this very speciﬁc type of roughness

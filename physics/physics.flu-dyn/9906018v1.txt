Abstract. We study the long-time, large scale transport in a three-parameter family of
isotropic, incompressible velocity ﬁelds with power-law spectra. Scaling law for transport
is characterized by the scaling exponent q and the Hurst exponent H, as functions of the
parameters. The parameter space is divided into regimes of scaling laws of diﬀerent functional
forms of the scaling exponent and the Hurst exponent. We present the full three-dimensional
phase diagram.

The limiting process is one of three kinds: Brownian motion (H = 1/2), persistent

fractional Brownian motions (1/2 < H < 1) and regular (or smooth) motion (H = 1).

We discover that a critical wave number divides the infrared cutoﬀs into three categories,
critical, subcritical and supercritical; they give rise to diﬀerent scaling laws and phase di-
agrams. We introduce the notions of sampling drift and eddy diﬀusivity, and formulate
variational principles to estimate the eddy diﬀusivity. We show that fractional Brownian
motions result from a dominant sampling drift.

1 Introduction

The movement of a passive scalar in a turbulent ﬂow is described by the stochastic diﬀerential
equation

dx(t) = V(x(t), t, ω)dt + √2κdw(t), x(0) = 0,

where x(t) is the position of the particle at time t, κ
0 the molecular diﬀusivity, w(t)
the standard Brownian motion and V(x, t, ω) a time-stationary, space-homogeneous, incom-
pressible velocity ﬁeld. Here ω denotes an element of an ensemble of random ﬂows.

We are concerned with the long time, large scale behavior of the displacement x(t). To

this end, we study the scaling limit

xε(t) = εx(t/ε2q),

as ε

with suitable q > 0. The scaling exponent q characterizes the time scale associated with
transport on the spatial observation scale 1/ε. The equation for the rescaled displacement
(1) becomes

dxε(t) = ε1−2qV(xε(t)/ε, t/ε2q)dt + ε1−q√2κdw(t).

When molecular diﬀusion is evidently negligible, we set κ = 0 to simplify the equation

dxε(t) = ε1−2qV(xε(t)/ε, t/ε2q)dt.

The eﬀect of molecular diﬀusion is discussed where the issue arises and in the concluding
remarks.

Motivated by existing diﬀusion limit theorems for steady ﬂows with ﬁnite-range, spatial
correlations ([19],[14]), on one hand, and those for temporally mixing ﬂows with long-range,
spatial correlations ([9], [15], [31]), on the other hand, we consider turbulent transport in
a class of random ﬂows with power-law spectra parametrized by α, β, γ (see Section 2 for
details).

Roughly speaking, the velocity ﬁeld V is time-stationary, space-homogeneous and Gaus-

an infrared cutoﬀ δ = εγ > 0. Ultraviolet cutoﬀs play less prominent role than do infrared
cutoﬀs in the scaling limit.

If the infrared cutoﬀ δ > 0 is ﬁxed, independent of ǫ, then the ﬂow is mixing in time (i.e.
correlation time is uniformly bounded, independent of wave number) and, consequently, the
scaling in (1) is diﬀusive, q = 1, and the limit is a Brownian motion ([15]). In the case of the
Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum (α = 4/3, β = 1/3, see [20]), [δ, K] represents the inertial
range where K −1 is the dissipation length and δ−1 is the integral length. In general, the
infrared cutoﬀ is determined by the scale of external forcing and the size of physical domain.
By letting δ change with ǫ, as δ = εγ, γ > 0, we vary the spatial scale of observation 1/ǫ in
relation to, e.g., the size of physical domain.

If the scaling limit exists, statistically independent of the initial point, and has station-
ary increments, then the transport process is said to be homogenized, and the up-scaling,
or coarse-graining, procedure represented by (1) is called homogenization. The scaling is
diﬀusive if q = 1, superdiﬀusive if q < 1, subdiﬀusive if q > 1. Sub- and super-diﬀusions are
called anomalous diﬀusion.

The limit Z(t) may be Gaussian or non-Gaussian, Markovian or non-Markovian, even
if the velocity ﬁeld is Gaussian and Markovian. In general Z(t) has stationary increments
as does xε(t) ([39]). If Z(t) is self-similar and Gaussian then it can be characterized by a
unique Hurst exponent H in its autocovariance function

Non-Markovian limits are related to non-local homogenization ([5], [11], [43], [44]). Pre-
viously nonlocal homogenization has been shown to arise as a result of fast oscillation, rather
than of a scaling limit.

If Z(t) is not Gaussian, then there may be a hierarchy of Hurst exponents corresponding
to higher moments of the process. When the sequence of Hurst exponents diverges as the
order of moment increases, the limit is intermittent. Intermittency eﬀect may also manifest
as multiple scaling exponents. We do not consider the problem of intermittency here.

In this paper, we do not address directly the question of existence and uniqueness of the
scaling limit. Rather, we assume the existence and uniqueness of a nontrivial scaling limit,
and seek to identify the scaling exponent and the second order Hurst exponent (the Hurst
exponent, in case of a Gaussian limit).
In doing so, we point out relevant mathematical
results that exist, or can be or are yet to be proved. We try to present a simple, coherent
physical picture of the whole phase diagrams. To enhance our case, we often analyze the
problems from several diﬀerent perspectives.

The exponent q characterizes the time scale associated with transport observed on the
space scale 1/ε; the exponent H characterizes the time correlation property of successive
increments on the observation scale (and, therefore, the roughness of the limiting sample
paths). Naturally we ask if the dimensionally correct relation

holds? When (10) holds the limit process is invariant under the same scaling transformation
It turns out that relation (10) generally holds for α < 1 but fails for α > 1.
(1).
If an
additional infrared cutoﬀ is made in the case of α < 1 and if the cutoﬀ is removed faster than
some critical wave number, kc, then (10) does not hold. In these situations, the inequality

H = 1/(2q)

H < 1/(2q)

(10)

(11)

is in place of (10). The inequality (11) is due to the fact that 2H characterizes the covari-
ances, whereas 1/q characterizes the variances, of successive increments of turbulent motion
on the observation scale.

In general the exponents q, H depend on the parameters α, β and the cutoﬀ δ = εγ and
can be expressed explicitly as functions of α, β, γ. Here it may be helpful to draw analogy
to critical phenomena in statistical physics: we think of α, β, γ are order parameters and
0 as thermodynamic limit and the exponents q, H given by formulas
the scaling limit ε
of α, β, γ as phases. The phase diagram divides the space of order parameters α, β, γ into
regions associated with diﬀerent formulas for q, H. Our results are summarized in Figures
1, 2 , 3 and 4. Since there are three parameters, the full phase diagram is three dimensional.
To simplify the presentation, we choose to portray the full diagram as two two-dimensional
diagrams, one for supercritical and the other for subcritical infrared cutoﬀs.

→

Note also that the phase diagrams are diﬀerent from those in statistical mechanics in that
our phases are continuum, not discrete: except for the diﬀusive regime of α + β < 1 where
H = 1/2, q = 1, H, q change from point to point, continuously or discontinuously. But their
functional forms in relation to α, β, γ are discrete and divided by phase boundaries.

Phase diagram was ﬁrst used by Avellaneda and Majda [1], [2] to present scaling limits
of turbulent transport in anisotropic, stratiﬁed ﬂows of the form V(x, t) = (v(x2, t), 0), with
x = (x1, x2). A diﬀerent diagram for the same shear-layer ﬂows was rigorously obtained by
Zhang and Glimm [46] using a diﬀerent approach. In the current paper we consider isotropic
turbulent ﬂows and the results are diﬀerent from those for anisotropic ﬂows. Also, we do
not attempt to derive the results rigorously here. Often we refer to existing theorems to
indicate how in principle results may be proved, subject to technical modiﬁcation, and to
support the physical arguments invoked; they are not intended to be mathematical proofs.
The proofs of many of the results are very technical and will be published elsewhere.

By contrast, our main ﬁndings are: (i) the transport eﬀect of the sampling drift and
related critical wave number, which are introduced for the ﬁrst time, (ii) fractional Brownian
motion limit as a result of the critical wave numbers, (iii) the eﬀect of infrared cutoﬀs, (iv)
the formulation of cutoﬀ dependent eddy diﬀusivity and its associated variational principle
without molecular diﬀusion. The variational principle gives a useful bound for the eddy
diﬀusivity.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we deﬁne the three-parameter
family of Gaussian ﬂows, whose transport properties are discussed in subsequent sections.
In Section 3, we introduce the notions of sampling drift, critical wave numbers and eddy
diﬀusivity. We also formulate variational principles that lead to general bounds for the
cutoﬀ dependent eddy diﬀusivity in terms of a fractional vector potential of the velocity
ﬁeld. Since the transition from ultraviolet to infrared cutoﬀ in velocity occurs at α = 1, we
divide the discussion accordingly into two cases: α < 1 and α > 1. We consider the case
α < 1 in Section 4 and the case α > 1 in Section 5. We conclude with various remarks
in Section 6. In Appendix we derive a variational principle for the cutoﬀ dependent eddy
diﬀusivity, without the presence of molecular diﬀusion.

2 Random velocity ﬁeld

In this section, we describe some mathematical properties of the random velocity ﬁelds
considered in this paper.

The most important property is stationarity in time and homogeneity in space (space-time
stationarity for short), without which homogenization is unlikely to hold. It should be noted
that, when formulated in a general, abstract framework as we will do momentarily, space-time
stationarity encompasses space-time periodicity, quasi-periodicity and almost periodicity as
well as random stationarity. This abstract formulation is also handy for formulating the
variational principle for the eddy diﬀusivity (Section 3.2). Elsewhere, the paper can be
understood without referring to the abstract formulation.

The variational principle in the absence of molecular diﬀusivity also uses explicitly the
Markov property of the ﬂow and the associated generator. A key turbulent diﬀusion theorem
cited in the discussion of the diﬀusive regime (Section 4.1) was proved for certain Markovian
velocity ﬁelds. For Markovian ﬂows, the mixing property conveniently corresponds to the
spectral gap of the generator. Elsewhere, the Markov property is not used explicitly and
probably not needed.

7

Since we only use the (energy) spectral density explicitly in presenting the phase dia-
grams, it is safe to assume that the velocity ﬁelds are Gaussian. In particular, the Gaussian
property is essential in the fractional-Brownian-motion regimes (II and III). Elsewhere, the
Gaussian property is probably not important.

Let us begin with the abstract formulation of space-time stationarity, upon which we
will deﬁne the Gaussian and Markov properties. Let Ω be the space of steady, space-
homogeneous velocity ﬁelds and let P be a probability measure on Ω. Homogeneity in space
can be canonically described by the invariance of the distribution P under the group of
}x∈Rd acting on Ω. We further assume that P is ergodic with respect to
translations

are constants. The measure P dictates the correlation of the velocity ﬁeld in space, and, in
case of Gaussian velocity ﬁelds, is determined by the energy spectrum.

Alternatively, we think of Ω as the ensemble of elements ω, representing the randomness
of the velocity ﬁeld, which is distributed according to the measure P . A (prototypical)
random velocity ﬁeld is a vector-valued, random variable (i.e., a function on Ω), denoted by
V(ω). The realization or the sample of the (time independent) velocity ﬁeld, V(x, ω), is the
V(τ xω). Since the measure P is invariant under
translate of

The time dependence of the velocity ﬁeld is then introduced as a time-stationary stochas-
tic process, ω(t), on the space Ω, which preserves the measure P . In other words, P is an
invariant measure of the process ω(t). The realization of time dependent velocity ﬁeld is
then given by

V(x, t, ω) =

V(τ xω(t)), ω(0) = ω.

In this formulation, the temporal properties are conveniently separated from the spatial
properties of the velocity ﬁeld. Additional structures such as Gaussianity and Markovianity
can be added on by imposing corresponding properties on P and ω(t). The space Ω is
usually inﬁnite dimensional in suitable coordinates such as Fourier modes. This formulation
is suﬃciently general to describe periodic, quasi-periodic, almost periodic as well as random
homogeneous velocity ﬁelds (see, e.g., [10]).

We think of a Markovian velocity ﬁeld as a sample path in Ω of a Markov process ω(t).

comparable to β = 1 in the Eulerian correlation in time. For β < 1, the generator

dominates over κ∆ for low wave numbers and, if a ﬁxed ultraviolet cutoﬀ is also present, are
also comparable to κ∆ for the other wave numbers. Thus, the eﬀect of molecular diﬀusion

3 Transport properties of various wave numbers

To study motion in a ﬂow with a power-law energy spectrum over a wide range of scales, it is
convenient to decompose the energy spectrum into the the sampling drift and the ﬂuctuating
velocity ﬁeld, and to consider separately their distinctive transport properties. The relation
between the sampling drift and the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld is like that between a mean ﬂow
and the ﬂuctuation.

3.1 Sampling drift and critical wave numbers

For each realization of random velocity ﬁeld there is a nonzero sampling drift due to random
ﬂuctuation, depending on the scale of observation.

The volume-averaged ﬂow on the observation scale consists of spatially non-ﬂuctuating
ε. The the volume-averaged ﬂow
wave numbers on the observation scale, namely, all
comprises three kinds of wave numbers: supercritical, critical and subcritical wave numbers
depending on their variations in time on the observation scale. Critical and supercritical
wave numbers compose the sampling drift.

As these wave numbers are temporally as well as spatially uniform, they behave like a

we pay special attention to those wave numbers that, on their own correlation time scales,
transport particles over a distance larger than the observation scale

Note that, for (19) to deﬁne a non-empty set of low wave numbers, we need α + 2β > 1.
For α + 2β
1, the supercritical wave numbers do not contribute to the transport on the
observation scale and are negligible asymptotically. In any case, the transport eﬀect of the
insigniﬁcant supercritical wave numbers are by nature negligible.

≤

Since we do not know the scaling exponent q ahead of time, we deﬁne the critical wave
numbers to be the boundary of those signiﬁcant supercritical wave numbers. Thus, the
critical wave numbers are of the order kc = εγc, with

The equality in (23) is admissible because asymptotics is a continuum and can not be fully
resolved by power-laws. Here we restrict our attention to the power-law part of scaling
behaviors.

For transport eﬀect, besides the line α + 2β = 2, the line α = 1 is also important for
the following reasons. For α < 1, the sampling drift is dominated by the critical wave
numbers, whereas, for α
1, the sampling drift is dominated by wave numbers nearby the
infrared cutoﬀ. Moreover, in the case of α
1, the infrared cutoﬀ corresponds to the energy
containing scale and, therefore, dominates the the transport as well as the ﬂow. As a result,
scaling laws of transport for α
1 are in general (infrared) cutoﬀ dependent. The limit
processes in the case of a supercritical cutoﬀ, however, are always regular motions (H = 1,
Regime IV) as the eﬀectively constant drift dominates the transport.

It is easy to see that, the (asymptotic) equality in (24) is achieved when the combined eﬀect
of the supercritical and the critical wave numbers is considered since, for α < 1, the critical
wave numbers are much stronger than the supercritical wave numbers in magnitude. For

As we will show by the variational method in Section 3.3 that the critical wave numbers

α + 2β < 2 is less than or equal to 2 (i.e., 2β/(α + 2β

deﬁnes Regime II; the latter deﬁnes Regime III. In the case of α
1, any nonnegative γ
leads to 1 + γ
2 (the scaling is superballistic for γ > 1). In the remaining region
(Regime I: α + β < 1 or α < 0), the supercritical wave numbers are negligible since the
transport eﬀect of the ﬂuctuating wave numbers is at least diﬀusive as we will see later.
Equating the exponent with 2q, we have, from (24), the scaling exponents for Regimes II,
III (see Section 4), and, from eq. (25), the scaling exponent for Regime IV (see Section 5),
both with supercritical cutoﬀs, γ > γc.

In the regimes where the critical wave numbers have a leading eﬀect, the scaling limit is
a fractional Brownian motion (Regimes II and III). Fractional Brownian motions arise as a
result of long-range correlation of the critical wave numbers.

If the infrared cutoﬀ is subcritical, i.e., δ

kc, wave numbers of the spectrum are
either temporally or spatially ﬂuctuating. Contrary to the fractional Brownian motion limit
caused by the critical sampling drift, the limit is always a Brownian motion. But the scaling
exponent may be superdiﬀusive due to low wave numbers in the vicinity of the cutoﬀ.

≫

3.2 Subcritical wave numbers: eddy diﬀusivity

To study the eﬀect of subcritical, or ﬂuctuating, wave numbers on transport, we think of
turbulent motion as a superposition of a mean ﬂow (i.e. cε), and the ﬂuctuating ﬂow,
following a spectral discretization.

We propose that the ﬂuctuating wave numbers give rise to a ﬂuctuating motion, on top
of the mean ﬂow, on the observation scale, and this ﬂuctuating motion can be characterized
by a notion of scale dependent eddy diﬀusivity introduced below. We then formulate two
variational principles and use them to obtain general upper bounds for the (scale-dependent)
eddy diﬀusivity.

Spectral discretization is motivated by a standard result of the ergodic theory for sta-
tionary processes that a stationary process is a limit of periodic processes (see [10]). We will
use the periodic approximation in two diﬀerent ways: In the ﬁrst, we consider the periodic
approximation in the space variables only and work with a subspace of (Ω, P ), the space
(Ω(n), P (n)) of time-independent, space-periodic velocity ﬁelds with period cell [0, n]d (see
discussion below). In this approach, time randomness in the velocity ﬁeld is represented as a
Markov process on (Ω(n), P (n)). In the second approach, we work with a sequence of space-
time periodic ﬁelds with the (normalized) Lebesgue measure as the probability distribution
on the space-time period cells as stated in the following lemma.

Lemma 1 Let ω be a stationary process. Then there exists a sequence of periodic processes
ωn of period ℓn → ∞
in each variable, such that, the probability measure Pn obtained as the
distribution of τxωn where x is random and distributed uniformly on the period cell [0, ℓn]d
converges weakly to the distribution of ω as n

.

→ ∞

(See, for instance, [37] for a proof). We emphasize that spectral discretization is only a con-
venience for the formulation of the variational principles; it is neither essential nor necessary.
We now formulate the ﬁrst approach more speciﬁcally. A spectrally discretized ﬂow can be
written as a sum cε + V(ε,n) where cε is the sampling drift (see Section 3.1 and eq. (22)), and
V(ε,n) is the spatially periodic version of the ﬂuctuating velocity ﬁeld with a discrete spectrum

approximate the eddy diﬀusivity since Taylor’s work ([42]). The physical signiﬁcance of the
bound (47) is that the eddy diﬀusivity D(ε)
ij of the ﬂuctuation is bounded, as the infrared cutoﬀ
is removed, by a constant times the Eulerian Taylor-Kubo formula (48); the eddy diﬀusivity
may be much smaller than (48) due to the spatial decorrelation of velocity.

A diﬀerent upper bound for the eddy diﬀusivity the can be obtained by using the second
variational principle (36). First we note that the eddy diﬀusivity in the presence of molecular
diﬀusion would be enhanced if we freeze the time variable of the velocity ﬁeld V(ε). This

4.1 Regime I: diﬀusive limit

(55)

As we will see below that D(ε)(e) should not vanish in the limit, so the scaling is diﬀusive
q = 1 and the scaling limit should be a Brownian motion (H = 1/2). The limit D∗(e) =
limε→0 D(ε)(e), if exists, is the (scale independent) eddy diﬀusivity. Similarly, for α < 0, the
variational bound (50) implies the diﬀusive scaling limit.

The eddy diﬀusivity probably does not vanish in the limit for the following reason. From
the turbulent diﬀusion theorem for mixing ﬂows, proved in [15], we know that, for β = 0, α <
1, the scaling is diﬀusive (q = 1) and the limit is a Brownian motion. As β increases, the
velocity correlation in time increases and so should the rate of transport. But the upper
bound (55) for the eddy diﬀusivity tells us that it can not enhance transport to the extent
of changing the scaling limit as long as α + β < 1 (This scenerio has been rigorously justiﬁed
in the region α < 0, β
1 in a diﬀerent turbulent diﬀusion theorem for non-mixing ﬂows,
proved in [15].).

≤

For α < 0, the (ordinary) vector potentials for the ﬂows are time-stationary, space-
homogeneous and have ﬁnite moments. Then the diﬀusion limit theorem of [14] holds for
q = 1, H = 1/2 if κ > 0). And the
such ﬂows if molecular diﬀusion is present (i.e.
eﬀective diﬀusivity can be determined from a pair of variational principles ([19]), one of
which is (36). This is manifest in the existence of (ordinary) vector potentials when α < 0.
As shown in [19], for steady ﬂows, the existence of space-homogeneous (ordinary) vector
potentials is the sharp condition for a diﬀusive scaling limit with molecular diﬀusion. As
time dependence of velocity becomes important with β
1, the phase boundary deﬁned
by α + β = 1, β
1 points to the fact that the existence of space-homogeneous, fractional
vector potentials becomes the criterion for the diﬀusive scaling limit.

≤

≤

For α + β > 1, α

0 (thus, β > 1 and α + 2β > 2), both the sampling drift and high
wave numbers are negligible. The eﬀect of molecular diﬀusion may not be negligible since
the Laplacian in the Lagrangian generator (17) dominates over

in low wave numbers.

4.2 Regime II: space-freezing property

As we have seen from the analysis of the sampling drift and the applications of variational
bounds, for

γ > γc, α + β > 1, α + 2β < 2, α < 1,

the sampling drift dominates the transport, and, therefore,

by (24) (and the discussion afterward). Moreover, since the sampling drift is asymptotically
uniform in space, the displacement can be approximated asymptotically by

Because the energy spectrum of U does not have small wave numbers, the process Z is
probably not self-similar. Thus, the Hurst exponent is not well-deﬁned. However, the long
time asymptotics of (65) is a Brownian motion, due to the mixing property of U, so we may
associate the asymptotic Hurst exponent 1/2 to the process deﬁned by (65).

The mixing time for the sampling drift is no less than 1/ǫ2β. On this time scale the sampling

ordinary sense. Study of transport in generalized velocity ﬁelds is interesting by itself, but
we do not pursue it here. Our only purpose is to use the energy spectrum of the velocity
ﬁeld as an indicator of the self-similarity of the limit process and to show how the space and
the time dependence of the velocity ﬁeld enter the equation. The same remark applies to
the same situation in the sequel as well as (65) and will not be repeated.

When the cutoﬀ is critical, i.e. γ = 1, the critical wave numbers are still present and
dominates the transport. Therefore, the scaling exponent is given by (66).

port. Thus, we expect q = β from (56). Indeed, with that and γc = 1, we have as before the

where the velocity ﬁeld U has the energy spectrum (7) supported in

to U occurring in the case of α
1, the velocity ﬁeld U in the case of α > 1 is an ordinary

the spectral gap in U.

In terms of U, the equation of motion becomes

= εγ(1−α)−2q+1U(xε(t)/ε1−γ, t/ε2q−2βγ)dt.

(75)

Now that the infrared cutoﬀ of U is 1, the limit is expected to be a Brownian motion as
long as either space or time variable is fast. Depending on the parameters, two types of
diﬀusion limit theorems in the literature are pertinent to this limit: one is based on velocity
decorrelation in time ([34],[24], [29], [30]) and the other on velocity decorrelation in space
([14]).

Eliminating the infrared divergence by rescaling is also the approach of Avellaneda and
Majda [3], in which the case of a critical cutoﬀ γ = 1 was considered in the region β <
1/2, 0 < α < 2. Here we adopt the same idea of rescaling and generalize their results by
using new limit theorems which were not available to them.

with ηε = εq−βγ. Eq. (79) has the form of the classical diﬀusion limit theorem ([34], [6], [24])
(Moreover, the velocity ﬁeld U is smooth and satisﬁes the mixing condition of Rosenblatt
([40]) even for β > 0 since U has no small k components) Thus, the process xε(t) converges to
a Brownian motion (H = 1/2) with diﬀusion coeﬃcients given by the Eulerian Taylor-Kubo
formula (64).

However, there is one constraint to be considered: (78) must be consistent with (77), i.e.,

ηε must tend to zero with ε. This means γ < 1/(α + 2β

1), a subcritical cutoﬀ.

−

5.1.2 Regime IV: smooth motion

If the cutoﬀ is supercritical, as discussed in Section 3.1, the transport in this regime is
dominated by the sampling drift that is, in turn, dominated by the wave numbers near by
the infrared cutoﬀ. Time as well as space dependence of the velocity ﬁeld are irrelevant.
Because both space and time variables are slow in the velocity ﬁeld, nontrivial scaling limit
holds only if δα−1ǫ2q−1 = 1. Thus we have

Consistency, 0 < q < γβ, then implies that γ > 1/(α + 2β

We note that the limit (81) is independent of the initial condition xε(0), is self-similar

and has a well deﬁned Hurst exponent.

is a smooth, Gaussian process. The Hurst exponent is not strictly well-deﬁned for Z(t) due
to lack of self-similarity. On large time scales, however, (85) has a Brownian motion limit
as U is temporally mixing and, thus, an asymptotic Hurst exponent H = 1/2. This case is
similar to Regime V.

In particular, when γ = 1 = 1/(α + 2β

1) and q = β, eq. (75) is independent of ε, i.e.

xε(t) = Z(t) with

−

dZ(t) = U(Z(t), t)dt.

(86)

The Hurst exponent is not strictly well-deﬁned for Z(t) due to lack of self-similarity. But,
as the velocity ﬁeld is temporally mixing, the long-time limit of Z(t) is a Brownian motion,
by the turbulent diﬀusion theorem of [15]. So H = 1/2 is the asymptotic Hurst exponent.
Another critical cutoﬀ is γ = 1 for α + 2β > 2. The equation of motion (75) becomes

which has a nontrivial limit when q = β = 1

α/2. The limiting process Z(t) satisﬁes

dxε(t) = ε2−α−2qU(xε(t), t/ε2q−2β)dt

−
dZ(t) = U(Z(t), 0)dt

which is regular for ﬁnite times, but is not self-similar. Thus the Hurst exponent is not well
deﬁned. It is not clear whether an asymptotic Hurst exponent is well-deﬁned either, since
we do not know if, without molecular diﬀusion, motion in three dimensional, steady ﬂows
like (87) can be homogenized or not. Bounded and unbounded streamlines may co-exist in
steady ﬂows and, if so, the resulting limit would depend on initial conditions.

5.2 γ < 1: Regimes V and VI

With γ < 1, fast space variables now enter the picture. There are two regimes depending on
whether time relaxation dominates over space decorrelation.

5.2.1 Regime V: dominant time relaxation

This regime occurs when δβ/εq

eq. (75) can be rewritten as (79), except that the space variable is also fast, albeit not fast
enough to have an impact in the diﬀusive scaling. In this case, the generalized limit theorems
proved in [29],[30] are applicable and they extend the validity of the Taylor-Kubo formula to
our situation. (Like the classical diﬀusion limit theorem, the generalized limit theorems also
require the mixing condition and regularity on the velocity U, both of which are satisﬁed
here.) The limit is a Brownian motion (H = 1/2) with diﬀusion coeﬃcients given by the
Eulerian Taylor-Kubo formula (64).
Condition (88) requires that

5.2.2 Regime VI: dominant space decorrelation

velocity dependence on space now dominates over the dependence on time in the diﬀusive
scaling of eq. (75). By choosing the scaling (δα−1ε2q−1)−1 = δ/ε or, equivalently,

−

dxε(t) = η−1

)dt, with ηε = ε1−γ.

The limit of (93) should be a Brownian motion as U gives rise to a space-homoegeous vector
potential (cf. the discussion in Section 4.5).

Consistency ((91) and q > 0) requires that α + 2β > 2,

γ < 2/α.

5.2.3 Phase boundary

On the phase boundary α + 2β = 2, eq. (93) becomes

dxε(t) = η−1

ε U(xε(t)/ηε, t/η2

ε )dt

(94)

with a temporally mixing ﬂow U. Space and time correlations play comparable roles in (94).
From the turbulent diﬀusion theorem for mixing ﬂows ([15]), it follows that the solution
xε(t) has a Brownian motion limit (H = 1/2).

6 Conclusions

The supercritical and subcritical diagrams (Fig.1 and Fig.2) are divided by the line, α+β = 1,
and the line, α + 2β = 2, and/or the vertical lines α = 0, 1, 1 + 1/γ, 2/γ. First of all,
α + β < 1 or α < 0 deﬁnes a cutoﬀ independent diﬀusive regime, in which the sampling drift
is negligible. Outside of the diﬀusive regime, the line, α + β = 1, is the cross-over between
short-ranged and long-ranged velocity correlations; the latter manifests in the fact that the
sampling drift dominates the transport and subcritical wave numbers are negligible. The
line, α + 2β = 2, is the cross-over between velocity dependence on space and on time; in the
region above the line, velocity dependence on time is negligible, whereas in the region below
the line velocity dependence on space is negligible.

Fig.3 and Fig.4 are cross sections of the full three-dimensional phase diagram at γ =
const. > 1 and γ = 1, respectively. In Fig.3, the cutoﬀ is supercritical for α + 2β > 1 + 1/γ
and subcritical for α + 2β < 1 + 1/γ. In Fig.4, the cutoﬀ is subcritical for α + 2β < 2 and
critical for α + 2β

2. Cutoﬀs with γ < 1 are subcritical and, thus, covered in Fig.2.

The limit is one of the three kinds: Brownian motion (H = 1/2), persistent fractional
Brownian motion (1/2 < H < 1) or regular, or smooth, motion (H = 1). The relation
H = 1/(2q) holds for α < 1 with supercritical infrared cutoﬀ but neither for subcritical
cutoﬀs nor for α > 1 (In these situations, H < 1/(2q), instead). For the critical cutoﬀ γ = 1,

≥

28

the Hurst exponent is not well deﬁned. However, an asymptotic Hurst exponent may be
deﬁned and it is equal to 1/2. The diﬀusive regime (q = 1, H = 1/2) is most robust in that
the scaling law is independent of any infrared cutoﬀs. The fractional Brownian motion limit
of Regime II and III is not aﬀected by supercritical cutoﬀs. All other regimes are cutoﬀ
dependent.

In the case of subcritical infrared cutoﬀs, with the rescaling of the velocity ﬁeld, the dia-
gram can be understood by means of three types of diﬀusion limit theorems in the literature:
(i) one for which the spatial dependence of velocity is negligible and the eﬀective diﬀusivity
is explicitly given by the Eulerian Taylor-Kubo formula ([25],[24],[29],[30]), (ii) another for
which the temporal dependence of velocity is negligible, but molecular diﬀusion is assumed
to be present, and the eﬀective diﬀusivity is implicitly given by a pair of variational principles
([13], [14], [19]) or a Stieltjes integral formula ([4]), and (iii) the other for which space and
time dependence of velocity play comparable roles and is referred to as turbulent diﬀusion
theorems (Two such theorems are proved in [15]). As in (ii), the turbulent eddy diﬀusivity
can be written as a variational principle similar to (30). After rescaling, Type (i) limit theo-
rems apply to Regime V; Type (ii) limit theorems apply to Regime VI and part of Regime I;
Type (iii) limit theorems apply to Regime I or on the phase boundary α + 2β = 2, 0 < α < 2.
All three types of limit theorems are insensitive to the dimension. This may explain certain
similarity between the phase diagram for shear-layer ﬂows of [1] or [46] and the diagram for
isotropic ﬂows with a subcritical cutoﬀ.

Similarly, there should be three types of fractional-Brownian-motion limit theorems: one
completely determined by Eulerian time decorrelation (Regime II), another determined by
the space decorrelation (Regime III) and the other determined by the dependence of velocity
on both space and time (The phase boundary α + 2β = 2, 0 < α < 1).

In the case of supercritical infrared cutoﬀs new phenomena emerge: dominant sampling
drift, fractional Brownian motion limits, critical infrared cutoﬀ and related cutoﬀ depen-
dent eﬀects. Although these phenomena are introduced and analyzed for motion in three-
dimensional, isotropic ﬂows, they also arise in two-dimensional ﬂows or anisotropic ﬂows
such as random shear-layer ﬂows. A diﬀerence lies in the role of molecular diﬀusion which
is much more prominent for anisotropic or two-dimensional ﬂows (see discussion in the next
section). New variational principles for the cutoﬀ dependent eddy diﬀusivity are formulated
and used to obtain general bounds for the eddy diﬀusivity.

Contrary to subcritical and supercritical cutoﬀs, regimes (II’, III’ and IV’) with criti-
cal cutoﬀs produce limits that are not self-similar and do not possess a well-deﬁned Hurst
exponent.

Scaling limits of turbulent transport in ﬂows with a nonzero mean drift have diﬀerent

phase diagrams (see [26], [45], [2]) and will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

6.1 Role of molecular diﬀusion

Molecular diﬀusion has at least two roles: (i) to eliminate possible dependence of scaling limit
on the initial point, as particles may be trapped by closed or bounded streamlines, so that
the process may be homogenized; (ii) to reduce dynamic velocity correlation in time and,
thus, change the scaling law to one with larger scaling exponent q. The ﬁrst role of molecular
diﬀusion is prominent for transport in steady ﬂows; without it, localized streamlines would

29

prevent homogenization from happening (see [18]). In this connection, molecular diﬀusion
also helps blend the eﬀects of streamlines of diﬀerent scaling behaviors. In the present work,
we always assume homogenization and we focus on the second role of molecular diﬀusion.

Molecular diﬀusion is negligible in Regimes II, III, IV, where the sampling drift dominates
the transport as well as Regimes V and part of I (i.e., α + β < 1 in the limit of high Peclet
number), where velocity decorrelation in time is signiﬁcant. But its eﬀect is not so clear in
Regimes VI and the other part of Regime I (i.e., α + β
1, α < 0), where the spatially
ﬂuctuating wave numbers dominate.

≥

A

, in (17), and see that, for β

In this regard, when high wave numbers are negligible, as for α+β > 1, one can go further
by comparing the term representing molecular diﬀusion, κ∆, and the term representing the
ﬂow,
1, the eﬀect of molecular diﬀusion should not aﬀect the
scaling law. As the velocity dependence on space dominates over that on time, the scaling
law is independent of β.
In view of the discussion in Section 4.4 on eﬀect of molecular
diﬀusion, we expect the scaling law for β > 1 can be extrapolated from that for β
1 to
conclude the scaling law of Regime VI is independent of molecular diﬀusion as well as β.

≤

≤

As α on the phase boundary (α = 0) is bigger than that in the region (α + β

1, α < 0),
for given β, the scaling exponent q in the region, with the absence of molecular diﬀusion,
should not be less than that of the phase boundary, which is 1. Therefore, q = 1 in this
region even without molecular diﬀusion.

Guide to the phase diagrams

The full diagram is in the three dimensional space of α, β, γ. To simplify the presentation,
we choose to portray the full diagram as four planar diagrams: the supercritical diagram,
the subcritical diagram, the cross sections γ = const. > 1 and γ = 1. Note that Regime II’
does not show up in any of the diagrams.

The exponents α and β deﬁned in (4)-(7) characterize the space-time correlations.

The exponent γ is related to the infrared cutoﬀ δ in (6) as δ = εγ.

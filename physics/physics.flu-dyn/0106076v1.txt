Abstract

A nonlinear equation describing curved stationary ﬂames with arbitrary gas
expansion θ = ρfuel/ρburnt, subject to the Landau-Darrieus instability, is obtained
in a closed form without an assumption of weak nonlinearity. It is proved that
in the scope of the asymptotic expansion for θ
1, the new equation gives the
true solution to the problem of stationary ﬂame propagation with the accuracy
1. In particular, it reproduces the stationary version of
of the sixth order in θ
the well-known Sivashinsky equation at the second order corresponding to the
approximation of zero vorticity production. At higher orders, the new equation
describes inﬂuence of the vorticity drift behind the ﬂame front on the front
structure. Its asymptotic expansion is carried out explicitly, and the resulting
equation is solved analytically at the third order. For arbitrary values of θ, the
highly nonlinear regime of fast ﬂow burning is investigated, for which case a large
ﬂame velocity expansion of the nonlinear equation is proposed.

1 Introduction

Curved ﬂame propagation is one of the most important and diﬃcult issues in the
combustion theory. Despite considerable eﬀorts, its closed theoretical description is still
lacking. Perhaps the main reason underlying complexity of the problem is the intrinsic
instability of zero-thickness ﬂames, the Landau-Darrieus (LD) instability [1, 2]. In view
of this, evolution of the ﬂame front cannot be prescribed in advance. Instead, it should
be determined in the course of joint analysis of the ﬂow dynamics outside the ﬂame
front and the heat conduction – species diﬀusion processes inside. In general, nonlinear
interaction of diﬀerent perturbation modes under the smoothing inﬂuence of thermal
conduction leads to the formation of a steady curved ﬂame front conﬁguration with the

curvature radius of the order 10Lf , where Lf is the ﬂame front thickness. This estimate
for the curvature radius can be obtained from the linear theory of the LD-instability
[3], where it corresponds to the cutoﬀ wavelength for the front perturbations; it is also
conﬁrmed by 2D numerical experiments on the ﬂame dynamics [4, 5].

In essential, diﬃculties encountered in investigation of the nonlinear development

of the LD-instability are twofold:

1) Perturbation analysis of the nonlinearity of ﬂame dynamics with arbitrary gas

problem of formation of the stationary ﬂame conﬁgurations.

2) Finite vorticity production in the ﬂame implies that the ﬂow dynamics down-
stream, and therefore the ﬂame front dynamics itself, is essentially nonlocal. The latter
means that the non-locality of equations governing ﬂame propagation is more complex
than that encountered in the linear theory and described by the Landau-Darrieus op-
erator.

Only in the case of small gas expansion can the problem be treated both perturba-
tively and locally, since then the amplitudes of perturbations remain small compared
to their wavelengths at all stages of development of the LD-instability [6, 7, 8], and
the ﬂow is potential both up- and downstream in the lowest order in θ
1, where θ is
the ratio of the fuel density and the density of the burnt matter. In this approxima-
tion, the nonlinear evolution of the front perturbations is described by the well-known
Sivashinsky equation [8].

−

The nonlinear dynamics of ﬂames with ﬁnite gas expansion has been the subject
of a number of papers some of which are brieﬂy considered here as the characteristic
examples of dealing with the diﬃculties mentioned above.

To render the problem tractable, certain simplifying assumptions has been intro-
duced by various authors in attempt to weaken or even get rid of one of the two above
features inherent to the nonlinear ﬂame dynamics. In Ref. [9], the vorticity production
in the ﬂame is completely neglected [see the point 2) above]. The mass conservation
and the constant normal ﬂame velocity are taken as the conditions governing ﬂame
dynamics. The problem is reduced thereby to the well-known electrodynamic problem
of determining the single layer potential with constant charge distribution proportional
to the gas expansion. However, neglecting the vorticity downstream breaks the conti-
nuity of tangential velocity components as well as the constant jump of pressure across
the ﬂame. This model thus violates the basic conservation laws to be satisﬁed across
the ﬂame front. Note that the number of neglected degrees of freedom (three in the
3-dimensional case) just corresponds to the number of broken conservation laws (two
tangential velocity components and the scalar pressure).

In contrast, in Ref. [10], an attempt is made to take into account the vorticity
production in stationary ﬂames, under the assumption of weak nonlinearity [see the
point 1) above]. From the mathematical point of view, however, the assumptions of
weak nonlinearity and stationarity contradict each other. Using them simultaneously
turns out to be inconsistent except for the case of small gas expansion. Indeed, let
us consider a weakly curved ﬂame front propagating in z-direction with unit normal
velocity1 with respect to an initially uniform fuel; the transverse coordinates will be
denoted x.
It is not diﬃcult to show that in this case the ﬂow equations up- and
downstream together with the conservation laws at the ﬂame front imply the following

case one has ∂f /∂x

From the physical point of view, this means that a weakly curved ﬂame with ﬁnite gas
expansion cannot be stationary. Instead, equations (1), (2) should be considered in this
case as determining evolution of the small perturbations in time. Indeed, substituting
Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we obtain, in the linear approximation,

which is nothing but the well-known LD dispersion relation for the perturbation growth
rate, written in the coordinate space [1, 2].

In practice, the discrepancy in the orders of magnitude, expressed by Eq. (3),
shows itself as the impossibility to correctly develop perturbation expansion in powers
of the slope. For instance, the jump of the pressure ﬁeld across the ﬂame front, found
in Ref. [10], Eq. (33), turns out to be velocity-dependent already for zero thickness
ﬂames, while according to the well-known exact result [12] this jump is constant along
the ﬂame front, and is equal to 1

θ.

Finally, we mention Ref. [13], where a non-stationary equation describing the inter-
action of perturbations at the early stage of development of LD instability is obtained
at the second order of nonlinearity, under a certain model assumption concerning the
structure of downstream ﬂow. Namely, it is assumed that there exists a local rela-
tion between the pressure ﬁeld and the potential mode of the velocity downstream
(expressed by the Bernoulli equation). However, as we mentioned in 2), the ﬂow dy-
namics downstream is essentially nonlocal, in particular, the pressure ﬁeld is expressed
through the velocity ﬁeld by an integral relation, its kernel being an appropriate Green
function of the Laplace operator. From the work [13], one can see once again that
the perturbative treatment of nonlinearities is not applicable to the stationary ﬂames
with arbitrary θ : since, at the ﬁrst order, the time derivatives of the front position
are linearly related to its space derivatives through Eq. (4), stationary form of the
non-stationary Zhdanov-Trubnikov equation depends on the way this relation is used
before the time derivatives are omitted. Transition to the stationary regime in this
equation is therefore ambiguous.

−

In view of what has been said, we arrive at the conclusion that the stationary ﬂames
can only be treated consistently in the framework of the small θ
1 expansion. Thus,
the problem of describing the stationary ﬂames, and more generally, non-stationary
ﬂames in the fully developed nonlinear regime, can be formulated as the problem of
deriving an expansion of unknown exact equation, governing ﬂame dynamics, in powers
of θ

−
The purpose of the present paper is to show that in the stationary case, such an
expansion can indeed be developed beyond the second order, the order of validity of
the Sivashinsky equation. We found it convenient to employ the model assumption of
Ref. [13] in our analysis, which allows one to obtain an equation describing ﬂames with
arbitrary gas expansion in a closed form, without the assumption of weak nonlinearity.
This will be shown in Sec. 3.1 on the basis of simple geometric considerations. That the
equation obtained actually provides the true expansion of (unknown) exact equation
with the accuracy of the sixth(!) order in θ
1 is proved in Sec. 3.2. This expansion
is carried out explicitly in Sec. 4.1. The third order equation turns out to have the
functional structure analogous to the Sivashinsky equation, and therefore can be solved
analytically. This solution is found in Sec. 4.2. Finally, the model equation obtained
in Sec. 3.1 is invoked in Sec. 5 for investigation of the highly nonlinear regime of fast
ﬂow burning, where a large ﬂame velocity expansion of this equation is proposed. The
results of the present work are summarized in Sec. 6. Some mathematical results used
in the text are derived in the Appendix.

2 Flow equations and conservation laws

Let us consider a 2D ﬂame propagating in an initially uniform premixed ﬂuid. Since
our main concern is the inﬂuence of ﬁnite gas expansion on the ﬂame structure, we
will assume in what follows that the ﬂuid is an ideal gas with constant thermal con-

duction and constant speciﬁc heat. The ratio of the heat and mass diﬀusivities (the
Lewis number) is taken to be unity. For deﬁniteness, we consider ﬂame propagation
in a tube of arbitrary width with ideally slip adiabatic walls. Under the assumption
that development of the LD instability ends up with the formation of a steady ﬂame
conﬁguration, we go over to the reference frame of the stationary ﬂame. Let the Carte-
sian coordinates (x, z) be chosen so that z-axis is parallel to the tube walls, z =
−∞
being in the fresh fuel. It will be convenient to introduce the following dimensionless
variables

(η; ξ) = (x/R; z/R), (w; u) = (vx/Uf ; vz/Uf ),

Π = (P

where Uf is the velocity of a plane ﬂame front, Pf is the initial pressure in the fuel far
ahead of the ﬂame front, and R is some characteristic length of the problem (e.g., the
cut-oﬀ wavelength). The ﬂuid density will be normalized on the fuel density ρ−. As
always, we assume that the process of ﬂame propagation is nearly isobaric. Then the
velocity and pressure ﬁelds obey the following equations in the bulk

Finally, the normal velocity of the fuel at the ﬂame front is unity, which is expressed

in the form of the evolution equation

Equations (8)–(11) are written for zero thickness ﬂames. These are of primary interest,
since in the majority of cases the thickness of the ﬂame front is small compared with

but nonzero thickness is straightforward and will be done in Sec. 3.3.

In principle, the system of equations (5) – (11) completely determines stationary
ﬂame conﬁguration as well as the ﬂows upstream and downstream. To derive an
equation for the ﬂame front function f (η), one has to ﬁnd solution of the bulk equations
(5) – (7) for the fuel and combustion products with appropriate boundary conditions
on the walls, subject to the conservation laws (8) – (10) which are a kind of boundary
conditions on the ﬂame front. The requirement that the obtained solution satisﬁes
Eq. (11) then gives an equation for the function f (η) itself.

As to the ﬂow upstream, the corresponding solution is readily obtained: since the
ﬂow is potential at ξ =
(u = V, w = 0, where V is the velocity of the ﬂame in
the rest frame of reference of the fuel), it is potential for every ξ < f (η) in view of the
Helmholtz theorem [14], thus

Things become more complicated downstream. There, no relation exists for the
variables u, w, Π, which can be expressed in terms of η alone, since the ξ-dependence of
these variables is unknown because of the presence of vorticity produced by the curved
ﬂame. Nevertheless, we will assume following Ref. [13] that a potential mode vp =
(wp, up) can be extracted from the downstream velocity v = (w, u), such that the
following Bernoulli-type relation holds between vp and Π

It will be shown in the next section, the above equations for the potential mode up-

constitute the system of equations suﬃcient to derive an equation for the function f (η)
in a closed form.

3 Nonlinear equation for the ﬂame front

3.1 Derivation

It will be shown presently that the set of equations (8) – (11), (13) – (15), (20), and
(21) can be transformed into one equation for the function f (η). The fact that this
set is written in a form that does not explicitly operates with the ξ-dependence of the
ﬂow variables makes it unnecessary to follow the program outlined in the preceding
section to obtain an equation for f (η). Namely, the speciﬁc structure of the up- and

downstream ﬂows in the bulk is now irrelevant.
dependence of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds turns out to be superﬂuous. Roughly
speaking, the ξ-dependence of a function F (ξ, η) describing the shape of the ﬂame front
is known in advance, since the equation F (ξ, η) = 0 can always be brought into the
form ξ
f (η) = 0 (with f many-valued, in general). Determination of the η-dependence
alone of the functions involved is therefore suﬃcient for the purpose of description of
the ﬂame front structure.

−

3One might think that since the vorticity is of the fourth order in θ

1, the ﬂow is to be potential
up to the third order. One should remember, however, that the expression of the velocity ﬁeld through
the vorticity ﬁeld is nonlocal. Speciﬁcally, we will see in Sec. 3.2 that the vorticity produced in the
ﬂame can be expressed as the η-derivative of a certain function of the velocity, while diﬀerentiation
along the ﬂame front brings in an extra power of θ

In what follows, it will be convenient to introduce separate designations for the up-
and downstream velocity and pressure ﬁelds. Namely, they will be distinguished by the
superscripts ” + ” and ”

(15), (20), and (21), together with the conservation laws (8) – (10) and the evolution
equation (11), can be rewritten identically as follows

The fact that now the function f (η) does not enter the arguments of these variables

with respect to the space translations, and therefore, all terms containing powers of
undiﬀerentiated f should appear in invariant combinations in the ﬁnal equation for f.
On the other hand, in view of the above-mentioned translation invariance, the function
f itself does not need to be small even if the front is only weakly curved (e.g., at the
early stage of development of the LD-instability). We thus see that the f -dependence
of the ﬂow variables through their arguments must eventually cancel in some way.

Let us now turn to the derivation of the equation for the function f (η).

Now, to obtain the equation for f (η), we have to use the remaining equation (29).

where ReF and ImF denote the real and imaginary parts of the complex function F,
respectively, and we used the fact that the Hilbert operator is real (see the Appendix).
To combine Eqs. (34), (36), and (38) into one, one has to solve the latter with respect
to φ. This can be done as follows.

Noting the relations ImiF = ReF, ReiF =

Let us consider the structure of Eq. (42) more closely.

Proof: First, let us show that if X is a solution of Eq. (43), then its square X 2 also

therefore,

or

(1 + i ˆH)X 2 = 0.

of its accuracy.

3.2 Accuracy assessment

We derived Eq. (48) using only exact transformations of the equations (22) – (30).
Therefore, its accuracy is determined entirely by the accuracy of the underlying model
assumption expressed by Eq. (15), which can be estimated as follows.

As we have mentioned above, the exact equation for the stationary ﬂame front can,
in principle, be obtained from the system of equations (5) – (11), of which only the
η-component of the Euler equations, Eq. (7), is not present in the set (
) of equations
describing our model. The question of the model accuracy, therefore, is the question of
the accuracy to which Eq. (7) is satisfyed by the model solution. To answer the latter,

∗

we need an explicit expression for the vorticity produced in the ﬂame, which will be
derived presently.

It was shown in Ref. [12] that with the help of the conservation laws (8) – (10) and
the evolution equation (11), the value of the vorticity just behind the ﬂame front can be
explicitly expressed in terms of the fuel velocity. Namely, with the help of Eqs. (5.32)

Since the ﬂow is potential upstream, the left hand side of Eq. (59) is zero. We conclude
that Eq. (59), and therefore Eq. (7), is satisﬁed with the accuracy of the sixth order in
α.

It is worth to emphasize that the model equation (15) has not been used in the
derivation of Eq. (59). Therefore, the latter holds true whatever model is considered,
provided that this model respects all the conservation laws at the ﬂame front, as well as
the ﬂow equations up- and downstream. Furthermore, Eq. (15) is model-independent
up to the second order in α, since to this order the ﬂow is potential downstream.
Extended to all values of θ, Eq. (15) thus provides the simplest model satisfying the
above-mentioned requirements.

Finally, considered as an equation for the quantity (u2

−)′, Eq. (59) determines
it with the accuracy of α6. On the other hand, since the left hand side of Eq. (48) is
proportional to the same quantity, α6 is the accuracy estimate for Eq. (48) as well.

− + w2

It remains only to make the following three important remarks.
R1) The above accuracy estimate is obtained from the analysis of diﬀerential equa-
tions governing the ﬂuid dynamics. These equations should be complemented by ap-
propriate boundary conditions. As we have already mentioned, the problem of ﬂame
propagation is essentially nonlocal; this non-locality shows itself in the fact that the
boundary conditions for the burnt matter, together with the boundary conditions for
the ﬂame front itself, are invoked in the course of integration of Eq. (48). By itself, this
equation is independent of the boundary conditions, since it is obtained by the direct

13

substitution of Eq. (47) into the Euler equation (6) for the burnt matter, written in
the form (36). Thus, the fact that the consistency condition (29) can be resolved with
respect to the phase φ is crucial for the above accuracy estimate. How the boundary
conditions are actually taken into account in the course of integration of Eq. (48) will
be shown in Sec. 4.1. Closely connected to this is the remark

R2) It was mentioned in Sec. 3.1 that the value (35) of the constant C entering
Eq. (34) is ﬁxed up to the second order, since to this order the ﬂow is potential down-
stream. One might think that the ambiguity in C at higher orders spoils the above
O(α6) accuracy estimate for Eq. (48). It is not diﬃcult to see, however, that within its
accuracy, Eq. (48) is not aﬀected by this ambiguity. Indeed, since the numerator in its
right hand side is of the order α3, a third order change in C in the denominator gives
rise only to terms of the order α6, and the same is true for the left hand side. This is
what we should have expected, since as we proved above, Eq. (48) is the true equation
with the accuracy α6, and as it is it must be independent of the model particularities
in the higher-order completion of C.

R3) As we mentioned in the points R1), R2), equation (48) depends neither on the
boundary conditions, nor on the higher order completion of the constant C. However,
given the boundary conditions, C is ﬁxed upon integration of Eq. (48). The point is
that the boundary conditions for the ﬂame front together with the boundary condition
for the ﬂuid velocity downstream imply more strong restriction on the value of C than
that given by Eq. (35) to the second order in α. This is because the ﬂow structure near
the ending points of the ﬂame front at the tube walls can be completely determined
with the help of the boundary conditions. Thus, the initial choice of the constant C
is eﬀectively corrected in the course of integration of Eq. (48) by the choice of the
integration constants, appropriate to the given boundary conditions. In view of this
fact, in practice, it is more convenient to work with Eq. (47), the undiﬀerentiated
version of Eq. (48), from the very beginning, and choose the constant C from the
requirement that the amplitude Ω and phase φ take the boundary values prescribed by
the boundary conditions. We follow this way in Sec. 4 below. Yet another example of
determining the constant C is given in Sec. 5.

3.3 Account of the ﬁnite ﬂame thickness

We will show in this section how the considerations of Sec. 3.1 can be generalized to
take into account the eﬀects due to ﬁnite ﬂame thickness.

The corresponding expression for the rate of change of the phase φ, which we do not

(
∗∗
with Eq. (67) for the amplitude, one obtains an equation for the function f (η), which
generalizes Eq. (48) for the case of nonzero ﬂame thickness.

The accuracy analysis for this equation is very complicated and will not be carried
out here. It should be noted, however, that such an analysis is superﬂuous to a consid-
erable extent. Indeed, the ﬁnite ﬂame thickness is mainly taken into account in order
to provide a short wavelength cutoﬀ for the spectrum of the ﬂame front perturbations,
which insures the existence of a stationary ﬂame conﬁguration. On the other hand, to
the leading order in α, the form of the ε-corrections to the equation for f (η) is known
It will be shown in the
in advance from the linear theory of Pelce and Clavin [3].
next section that, along with the nonlinear ε-corrections, the equations obtained above
correctly reproduce their result for the cutoﬀ wavelength.

4 The small (θ

1) expansion

−

In its general form, Eq. (48) is very complicated.
It is a highly nonlinear integro-
diﬀerential equation, which can be solved only numerically. On the other hand, as we
showed in Sec. 3.2, this equation correctly approximates the exact equation for the
ﬂame front of zero thickness up to the ﬁfth order in α. We now turn to expanding
Eq. (48), generalized to the case of nonzero ﬂame thickness, up to this order. As the
result, a much simpler equation will be obtained, which generalizes the Sivashinsky
equation [8] taking into account vorticity production in the ﬂame.

4.1 Fourth order equation for the ﬂame front

We will see below that to the order being considered, Eq. (33) can be integrated
with respect to the phase, which implies that both sides of Eq. (48) are actually full
derivatives. However, it would be hasty to simply omit these derivatives: integration
of Eq. (48) requires careful account of the boundary conditions. Since this equation
is integral, it is not suﬃcient to impose only one condition to ﬁx the constants of
integration in its left and right hand sides. Boundary conditions for the burnt matter
and for the ﬂame front itself actually supply two independent conditions to be used to
ﬁx two arbitrary constants: one additive constant in the phase of the complex function
(32), and one multiplicative constant in its amplitude.

We proved in Sec. 3.2 that within the accuracy of the sixth order in α, Eq. (48) is
independent of a particular completion of the constant (35) beyond the second order.
However, diﬀerent choices of C correspond to diﬀerent values of the integration con-
stants in the phase and amplitude. It turns out that in the case of ideal tube walls,
the particular choice (35) made in Eq. (48) implies that integration of this equation
gives exactly Eq. (47) where φ0 = 0, φ0 being the value of the phase φ at the tube
walls. We will prove this statement only for zero-thickness ﬂames. As we pointed out in
Sec. 3.3, nonzero ﬂame thickness should be taken into account mainly in order to pro-
vide the short wavelength cutoﬀ for the ﬂame front perturbations. On the other hand,
ε-dependence of the constants of integration is of little interest, and will be neglected
in what follows. Let us now turn to the proof of the above statement. First of all, since
p + O(α3), the phase
the downstream ﬂow is potential up to the second order, v+ = v+
p ) = O(α3), since w+ = 0 at the walls. Furthermore, noting that
φ0 = arg(u+
n)2, where t and n are the tangential and the normal to the
u2
− + w2
tN = w− + f ′u−,
ﬂame front unit vectors, respectively, taking into account that v−

.

It follows from this formula that σ = 0 at the walls, since the boundary conditions
are assumed ideal. We conclude that the ﬂow is potential near the walls, u+ = u+
p ,
w+ = w+
p , and thus φ0 = 0. For the same reason, the amplitude Ω = θ at the walls.
Now recall that the value (35) for the constant C was obtained in Sec. 3.1 from the
boundary conditions u−
p = 0, valid up to the second order.
We see, therefore, that in the case when the boundary condition for the ﬂame front is
f ′ = 0, Eq. (35) is extended to all orders in α, and thus Eq. (47) is indeed the integral
of Eq. (48), satisfying the boundary conditions.

Let us now proceed with expanding Eq. (47) in powers of α. Since the numerator
in the right hand side of Eq. (33) is of the third order in α, it is suﬃcient to expand
the denominator up to the second order:

equation on the boundary conditions for the burnt matter is a reﬂection of the essen-
tial non-locality of the process of curved ﬂame propagation, mentioned already in the

4.2 Solution of the third order equation for the ﬂame front

The third order equation (78) is of the same functional structure as the Sivashinsky
equation (76). Therefore, it can be solved analytically using the method of pole de-
composition [15, 16]. Considering the ﬂame propagation in a tube of width b with ideal
walls (for deﬁniteness, the walls are taken to be the lines η = 0 and η = b), we look for
2b-periodic solutions of the form

poles come in conjugate pairs; P is the number of the pole pairs. Requiring the 2b-
η, one can

It is seen from Eq. (84) that for the tube width b > λ(1), the solution (82) is not unique:
diﬀerent solutions corresponding to diﬀerent numbers P of poles are possible. To ﬁnd
the physical ones, the stability analysis is required which, of course, cannot be carried
out in the framework of the stationary theory. However, as we have mentioned above,
the functional structure of Eq. (78) is very similar to that of the stationary Sivashinsky
equation (76). Under assumption that the non-stationary versions of these equations
are also similar, the stability analysis of Refs. [17]–[19] will be carried over the present
case. According to this analysis, for a given tube of suﬃciently small width, there
is only one (neutrally) stable solution. This solution corresponds to the number of

poles that provides maximal ﬂame velocity.

7Since the application of pole decomposition to Eq. (78) is quite similar to that given in Refs. [15,

16], we refer the reader to these works for more detail.

5 Large ﬂame velocity expansion

As we have seen, Eq. (48) considerably simpliﬁes in the case of small α. For suﬃciently
narrow tubes, it gives results which turn out to be in a reasonable agreement with the
experiment already at the third order in α. Let us now consider the opposite case of
very wide tubes, i.e., tubes of width large compared to the cutoﬀ wavelength. As it
will be shown presently, under a certain burning regime, Eq. (48) can be written in a
much simpler form in this case too.

Widely employed in modern jet engines is the process of the so-called fast ﬂow
1). This regime is characterized by a large stretch of the
burning (see, e.g., [7], Ch.6,

surface (in 2D case, to the front length). Indeed, equating the fuel ﬂow at ξ =

account the boundary conditions w = 0, f ′ = 0, one has

where l is the length of the ﬂame front, n the unit vector normal to the ﬂame front
(pointing to the burnt matter), and b is the tube width.

Under these circumstances, it is natural to develop an expansion of Eq. (48) in

powers of the inverse ﬂame velocity, 1/V. This can be done as follows.

Let us note, ﬁrst of all, that large value of V implies, in general, that the quantity
υ (and, therefore, the quantity ˆHυ – the η-component of the fuel velocity at the ﬂame
V at
front) is also large. Indeed, as it follows from the evolution equation (11), υ = 1
the tube wall, in view of the boundary condition f ′ = 0. Now, we make the assumption
that in the bulk, i.e., for all η except for a small region near the points η = 0, b, the
quantity υ is actually of the order O(1), rather than O(V ). Then the integral quantity
ˆHυ = O(1) + δ/b O(V ) = o(V ), since the size δ of the region where υ
V is assumed
to be small compared with the tube width b, δ

Expansion of Eq. (48) in powers of 1/V is straightforward. Below, this expansion
will be carried out only to the lowest nontrivial order. As in Sec.4, Eq. (30) for the
phase integrates at this order. Therefore, it is more convenient to work with the integral
version (47) of the equation (48) from the very beginning.

Let us ﬁrst consider the question concerning the form of the quantities Ω, φ entering
this equation. As we saw in Sec. 3.1, the value (35) of the constant C in the expression
(34) for the amplitude Ω is ﬁxed up to the second order in α. Furthermore, it was shown
in Sec. 3.2, that within the accuracy of our model, the form of Eq. (48) is independent
of a particular completion of C beyond the order α2, and that the value of C, together
with values of the arbitrary constants of integration of Eq. (48), can be deduced from
the boundary conditions. In contrast, the boundary conditions cannot be used directly

in the framework of the 1/V -expansion, since this expansion breaks down near the tube
walls. Instead, the value of the constant C as well as the constant φ0 of integration
of Eq. (33) will be determined from the requirement of self-consistency of the limiting
transition V

Note that in the case of small α, the values (88) for the constants C, φ0 coincide
with those found in Secs. 3.1, 4.1, respectively, up to the order α2. On the other
hand, expansion of Eq. (47) in powers of υ/V has the strict validity in this case, since
υ
(0, b). We conclude, therefore, that the ﬁrst
order of the large V expansion of Eq. (47) must automatically reproduce the second
order of the small α expansion of this equation, i.e., the Sivashinsky equation (76).

Since the ﬂame is highly stretched in the fast ﬂow burning regime, the slope f ′ of the
ﬂame front is large. However, it follows from Eq. (89) that the quantities υ and ˆHυ
remain of the order O(1), since f ′/N < 1. Our initial assumption is thus conﬁrmed.

formally extend this deﬁnition to include nonzero values of C by setting ˆHC = βC with some number
β which must be one and the same for all C, in order to preserve the linearity of the Hilbert operator.
Furthermore, the properties (94) and (98) are preserved only if β =
i. Since the quantities φ, Ω are
real by deﬁnition, the choice (88) is unique.

Resolving Eqs. (60), (61) with respect to u+, w+, we see that the ε-corrections to
these quantities are only of the relative order 1/V 2. Analogously, the ε-correction in
the pressure jump (62) is O(1), which implies the same O(1/V 2) relative correction in
the amplitude Ω. Thus, we conclude that Eq. (47) remains unchanged in the ﬁrst order
in 1/V, and so does, therefore, its consequence, Eq. (89). Substituting the latter into

6 Discussion and conclusions

We have shown that in the stationary case, the asymptotic expansion of the nonlinear
equation for the ﬂame front position can be pushed beyond the second order in θ
1,
at which the gas ﬂow is potential on both sides of the ﬂame front, to take into account
vorticity drift behind the ﬂame front. This expansion has been carried out explicitly;
for the case of ideal tube walls, it is given by Eqs. (78), (81) at the third and fourth
orders, respectively. Remarkably, the third order equation, which describes inﬂuence
of the vorticity on the ﬂame front structure to the lowest nontrivial order, turns out
to have the same functional structure as the Sivashinsky equation. As we showed in
Sec. 4.2, it gives results in a reasonable agreement with the numerical experiments on
the ﬂame propagation in tubes for the case of ﬂames with θ

−

3.

It should be mentioned that the nonlinear equation for the ﬂame front, derived
in Ref. [10], also gives satisfactory description of the stationary ﬂame propagation in
narrow tubes. We showed already in the Introduction that the approach of Ref. [10]
is self-contradictory. Still, one might imagine that despite an erroneous derivation, the
resulting equation is correct. However, the results of Sec. 4.1 show that in the case
θ
1, asymptotic expansion of the true nonlinear equation is quite diﬀerent from that
of the equation proposed in Ref. [10]. The latter is incorrect, therefore, already in the
case of small gas expansion.

→

From a more general point of view, the theory of ﬂame propagation in the fully
developed nonlinear regime cannot be formulated in the way the Sivashinsky equation
[8] or the Frankel equation [9] are formulated. This is because the assumption of
potentiality of the ﬂow downstream, employed in these works, renders the relations
between the ﬂow variables local, allowing thereby the formulation of equation for the
ﬂame front position in terms of this position alone. In contrast, account of the vorticity
production in the ﬂame makes the problem essentially nonlocal, since, e.g., the value
of the pressure ﬁeld on the ﬂame front is a functional of the velocity ﬁeld in the bulk,

≤

24

which implies, in particular, that the equation for the ﬂame front position must be a
functional of the boundary conditions. Indeed, as we saw in Sec. 4.1, the boundary
conditions on the tube walls are invoked in the course of derivation of the asymptotic
expansion of this equation already at the third order.

Finally, with the help of the general equation (48), highly nonlinear regimes of the
stationary ﬂame propagation can be considered. We would like to remind that this
equation respects all the conservation laws to be satisﬁed across the ﬂame front, by
construction. Thus, despite the fact that the vorticity drift behind the ﬂame front
is taken into account in this equation on the basis of the model assumption (15),
unjustiﬁed for arbitrary θ, one may hope that it gives at least qualitative description.
We showed in Sec. 5 that in the particular case of the fast ﬂow burning, equation (48)
(as well as its generalization to the case of nonzero ﬂame thickness) can be highly
simpliﬁed by expanding it in powers of the inverse ﬂame velocity. The result of this
expansion to the ﬁrst order is given by Eq. (91).

Eq. (99) is convenient in estimating the orders of magnitude of expressions involving

the operator ˆΦ. In view of Eqs. (93) and (94), one has

i.e., the Hilbert operator has unit norm, and therefore

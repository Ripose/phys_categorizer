Abstract

We consider a ferroﬂuid cylinder, that is rotating with constant rotation frequency Ω = Ωez as

a rigid body. A homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H0 = H0ex is applied perpendicular to the cylinder

axis ez. This causes a nonequilibrium situation. Therein the magnetization M and the internal

magnetic ﬁeld H are constant in time and homogeneous within the ferroﬂuid. According to the

Maxwell equations they are related to each other via H = H0 − M/2. However, H and M are

not parallel to each other and their directions diﬀer from that of the applied ﬁeld H0. We have

analyzed several diﬀerent theoretical models that provide equations for the magnetization in such

a situation. The magnetization M is determined for each model as a function of Ω and H0 in a

wide range of frequencies and ﬁelds. Comparisons are made of the diﬀerent model results and the

diﬀerences in particular of the predictions for the perpendicular components Hy = −My/2 of the

ﬁelds are analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

There are several theoretical equations for the dynamics of the magnetization M(r, t)

of a ferroﬂuid that is ﬂowing with velocity u(r, t) in an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld

H0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Here we compare their predictions for a simple special case that is

experimentally accessible. We consider a ferroﬂuid cylinder of radius R of suﬃciently large

length to be approximated as inﬁnite in a homogeneous applied ﬁeld H0 = H0ex in x-

direction. The ferroﬂuid cylinder is enforced via its walls to rotate as a rigid-body around

its long axis with constant rotation frequency Ω = Ωez being oriented perpendicular to H0.

The ﬂowﬁeld is thus u(r) = Ω ×r = Ωreϕ where eϕ is the unit vector in azimuthal direction.

In such a situation all aforementioned models allow for a spatially and temporally constant

nonequilibrium magnetization M that is rotated out of the directions of H0 and H by the

ﬂow. The Maxwell equations demand that the ﬁelds H and M within the ferroﬂuid are

related to each other via

as indicated schematically in Fig. 1 and that the magnetic ﬁeld outside the ferroﬂuid cylinder

is a superposition of the applied ﬁeld H0 and the dipolar contribution from M.

II. MAGNETIZATION EQUATIONS

The model equations that we compare here imply a relaxational dynamics either of M

towards the equilibrium magnetization

or of the ”local equilibrium” or ”eﬀective” ﬁeld

towards the internal ﬁeld H. The equilibrium magnetization Meq(H) referring to the func-

tional relation between internal ﬁeld H and magnetization in the case of Ω = 0 is a thermo-

dynamic material property of the ferroﬂuid. The eﬀective ﬁeld Hef f lies parallel to M and

can be seen as the inverse of the deﬁning requirement

M = Meq(Hef f ) .

In equilibrium, Ω = 0, one has Hef f = H and M = Meq.

variant of ref. [5]. These equations have to be solved numerically in combination with the

Maxwell equation (1.1).

As an aside we mention that the above equations can be written in the common form

M × (Ω + α3M × H0) = α1(H0 − α2M)

III. RESULTS

In order to make the comparison of the theoretical results easier we replace the equi-

librium magnetization Meq(H) by the Langevin expression Meq(H) = MsatL (3χ0H/Msat)

with the initial susceptibility χ0 = χ(H = 0). We use χ0 = 1.09 and Msat = 18149A/m for

the saturation magnetization which is appropriate for the ferroﬂuid APG 933 of ???FER-

ROTEC???. The resulting curve is shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, we replace the relaxation
time τ (H) by τB = 6 · 10−4s. For ζ ≃ 3

2Φη we use the values η = 0.5P a · s and Φ = 0.041 and

for γH we use γH = χ0/τB [6]. For the parameter ξ of ML [5] we investigate two diﬀerent

choices: Either the low-ﬁeld variant, ξ = χ0/τB, as in FK that is denoted here by ML(F).

Or the variant ξ = 1/[F (M)τB] as in S’01 that is denoted here by ML(S).

Especially the perpendicular component Hy = − 1

2 My of the magnetic ﬁeld is suited for a

comparison of the diﬀerent models with each other and with experiments. Before doing the

former we should like to draw the attention to the frequency behavior of My(H0, Ω). We

mentioned already that My vanishes for zero vorticity, Ω = 0. Furthermore, one ﬁnds that

December 28, 2012

My as well as Mx vanishes also in the limit Ω → ∞. And since one can rewrite the solution

of eq.(2.9) in the form My =

Ωτ
α1+α3M 2

M 2
H0 one sees that My(Ω) has a maximum as a function

of Ω as in Fig. 3. There we show Hy versus Ω.

FIG. 3: Comparison of the predictions of the diﬀerent theoretical models for the transverse internal

ﬁeld Hy versus rotation frequency Ω.

The diﬀerences in the results for the diﬀerent models are easily captured by comparing

their predictions for the maximum values of |Hy|, the locations of these maxima at Ωmax,
and the initial slopes d|Hy|

dΩ at Ω → 0, each as a function of applied ﬁeld H0. This is done in

Fig. 4.

The maximal values of |Hy| of Debye and S’72 are the same while their locations, Ωmax,

diﬀer. The models S’01, FK, and ML formulated in terms of the eﬀective ﬁeld also share a

common maximal value of |Hy| being larger than that of Debye and S’72 while the location,

Ωmax, diﬀer partly substantially. Hence the magnetic torque, M × H, entering into S’72,

FK, and S’01 only shifts the frequency Ωmax. It remains to be seen whether experiments

can be performed with suﬃcient accuracy to discriminate between the diﬀerent theoretical

Abstract

The relativistic extension of non-relativistic hydrodynamics suﬀers
In non-relativistic hydrodynamics where
from notorious diﬃculties.
diﬃculties also abound, it has proved a useful supplement to study
lattice models which can imitate viscous ﬂuid ﬂow. In this paper we
construct a relativistic spacetime lattice and construct a dynamics of
points, thus a relativistic cellular automaton over it, to model relativis-
tic ﬂuid ﬂow. A simple example is also explicitly studied, and some
numerical results with ﬁgures are shown in the last section.

INTRODUCTION

A causal description of matter under extreme conditions is a very diﬃcult
task. A relativistic description of heavy ion physics suﬀers strongly from
this predicament. A microscopic causal description is not available since
we do not know suﬃciently well the microscopic interactions among the
constituents under these conditions. A proper relativistic interaction must
be local and handled through ﬁelds. Usually, however, one attempts to
formulate a theory entirely in terms of the matter degrees of freedom.
At the same time it is not ensured that a more macroscopic, causal and local
description of nuclear matter alone, and in which the ﬁeld degrees of freedom
responsible for the interaction are entirely removed, exists. According to
Hilbert[1], Bogoliubov[2] and others, such a separation and elimination of
the degrees of freedom would require the coexistence of widely disparate time
scales in the evolution of the system; one associated with the ﬁeld degrees of
freedom and the other with the matter degrees of freedom. The existence of

diﬀerent time scales in the ﬁeld degrees of freedom and the matter degrees

of freedom is not at all assured in the highly relativistic region! (Such a

separation of the ﬁelds from the matter was given by van Kampen [3] for a

highly simpliﬁed, non-relativistic model and resulted in integral equations.
For matter interacting through Boson ﬁelds, see de Groot et al.[4], p.79.)
If, however, we disregard these worries, we may attempt to use the sim-

plest macroscopic causal description of the matter (with the exclusion of

the ﬁelds), namely, hydrodynamics, supported with local thermodynamical
relations, both adapted for extreme conditions, i.e., for high velocities and
large internal energies. Such forms of relativistic hydrodynamics have been
known for a very long time [5, 6].

The tool of relativistic hydrodynamics has, alas, its own diﬃculties. In per-

fect ﬂuid dynamics the mean free path in a ﬂuid is zero. The introduction

of dissipation (viscosity and heat conduction) provides for a non-zero mean

free path. At relativistic energies where transparency eﬀects become impor-

tant, the introduction of such eﬀects would appear essential. However, it is

unclear how one can separate the dissipative eﬀects from the others at rel-
ativistic energies. This separability also hinges on the existence of diﬀerent

time scales in the motion of relativistic matter alone. To uncover such a

possibility one should translate Bogoliubov’s original ideas in an invariant

manner to a relativistic description. This has not yet been done.

With dissipation, the Euler equations generalize, albeit with ambiguities,

to something much more complicated.

(A review of the basic problems

with detailed literature references can be found in ref.

[7].) Two of the

ambiguities are:

1) A result of introducing dissipation is that the energy ﬂow will no longer

be in the same direction as the matter ﬂow or the entropy ﬂow. One has

then a dilemma in choosing a rest frame: a frame with zero energy ﬂow

may have a nonzero matter ﬂow, and nonzero entropy ﬂow. This ambiguity

has led to diﬀerent choices: Eckart chose a frame in which the matter ﬂux

was zero, Landau one in which the energy ﬂux vanishes. The third natu-

ral choice, the vanishing of the entropy ﬂux, could be exploited with equal

February 2, 2008

3

justiﬁcation. Linear combinations of these ﬂuxes could also be used. The

resulting theories are not equivalent except in the limit of zero dissipation.

This makes one wonder why one should introduce a rest frame at all! How-

ever, near equilibrium the instantaneous local rest frame is needed to specify

the thermodynamical quantities which appear in the ﬂuid equations.

2) Instabilities and acausal behavior may arise as demonstrated by Hiscock

and Lindblom[8] and by Geroch and Lindblom[9, 10]. In the Eckart frame all

solutions have instabilities and are acausal. The instabilities grow exponen-
tially with a time scale on the order of 10−25 seconds. In the Landau frame
almost all solutions are unstable. A recent theory espoused by Carter[11]

has been found to have similar problems[12].

An alternative approach that attempts to include dissipation has been ad-

vanced by Israel and Stewart[14, 15, 16, 17] and is a generalization of a

nonrelativistic theory by M¨uller[18]. However, the ﬁve Euler equations are

replaced in the Israel and Stewart model by fourteen equations and the three

coeﬃcients of viscosity and the coeﬃcient of conduction in the Navier-Stokes

equation is replaced by six new coeﬃcients. Hiscock and Lindblom[19, 20]
have also analyzed Israel’s theory. In the Eckart frame instabilities still per-

sist, but in the Landau frame, solutions are stable and causal for modest

deviations from equilibrium; for large deviations from equilibrium and for

large values of internal energy, problems persist. A relativistic kinetic theory

for dilute gases has also been developed, starting with the work of Synge [21]

and developed greatly by Israel and others. (See the detailed discussion in

the book by de Groot et al.[4] and in the articles by Israel[22, 23]). However,

not all the diﬃculties and ambiguities have been successfully resolved.

A broad class of relativistic dissipative theories have been reviewed by Ge-

roch [24] who concludes that there are a vast number of competing theories

whose physical usefulness is questionable in the regimes where they agree

with each other, while their diﬀerences are important only in those regimes

in which they already break down.

Past experience on non-relativistic hydrodynamics [25, 26] suggests that

a clearer understanding of many features of the ﬂuid ﬂow may be gleaned

February 2, 2008

through the use of discrete models, lattice automata. In this note we describe

how such lattice automata can be constructed in the relativistic domain.

Since in these lattice automata the interactions are not handled through

ﬁelds, but through contact interactions, the separation of the matter degrees

of freedom from those of the ﬁeld is not needed.

2 SPACETIME LATTICES

Non-relativistic lattice automata make use of the Galilean group. The
Galilean group is the product of the Euclidean group (rotations and trans-

lations in space) and the (one dimensional) translation group along the time

axis. Since the translations along time are independent of the spatial trans-
formations, the structure of the lattice is entirely determined by the discrete
subgroups of the Euclidean group, the standard crystallographic groups of
the required spatial dimensions. The incorporation of the time translations

are unnecessary. A space-like vector connects the lattice sites in Euclidean

space, and its components transform corresponding to contravariant vectors

under the action of the discrete rotations. Because the hopping speed from

lattice point to lattice point is not restricted by any invariance requirement
there will always be a Galilean transformation which can reduce any hopping
velocity to rest.

The incorporation of the conservation laws in a non-relativistic lattice model

simply means that the hopping rules must be such that a) if a point hops

without encountering another one its velocity is unchanged; b) if two or

more points meet, the rule determining the next step must satisfy the con-

servation laws. As the time translations play no role, the updating rules of a
Newtonian automaton need to be concerned only with the crystallographic
lattice.
The situation changes if the automaton is relativistic; now a full spacetime

lattice must be used. As before, invariance requirements enter in the same

two places, but with diﬀerent consequences:
a) the spacetime lattice must now be invariant on a discrete subgroup of the

February 2, 2008

5

Poincar´e group, the invariance group of relativistic dynamics;
b) the hopping rules must incorporate the relativistic energy-momentum
conservation laws.

The Poincar´e group is formed by Lorentz transformations and spacetime
translations. It has an inﬁnite number of discrete subgroups, producing an

inﬁnite number of diﬀerent spacetime lattices, in contradistinction to the

ﬁnite number of crystallographic lattices. The microscopic dynamics will

consist of hopping on such a spacetime lattice according to certain rules.

The discrete Lorentz transformations used in constructing such a lattice will
link the space and time variables. As a consequence, not all frame velocities
are permitted but only those which can be reached by the class of Lorentz
transformations present in the discrete subgroup envisaged. Accordingly,
one can preserve only as much of full Lorentz invariance ( generated by the
continuous group) as allowed by the discretization.
If we also desire - as
we shall do - that any microscopic one-step spacetime hop velocity could be
transformed away, then only those hop velocities are permitted which are
generated through boosts produced by the allowed class of discrete Lorentz

transformations. (This condition could conceivably be relaxed, arguing that
a local “rest” frame means the vanishing of some average ﬂux, and not
a microscopic velocity. For example, the instantaneous speed of a Dirac

electron is always the speed of light, due to its Zitterbewegung, while its

average velocity can be anything less than c.)

The actual construction of the hopping rules require the construction of the

spacetime lattice in order to determine the allowed Lorentz transformations

and thereby the allowed world momenta. To do this we will study a spe-

ciﬁc example in greater detail. This simple example is too primitive to be

physically realistic, but it will exhibit explicitly the methods embodied.

An interesting previous attempt has been made without the use of the above

requirements by Hersbach[31]. There a one dimensional model was obtained

in which the particles move right or left with the velocity of light. This has

serious consequences: a) there is no rest frame for the microscopic particle

February 2, 2008

motion, b) in the collisions detailed balancing and time reversal invariance

are violated.

LATTICES

3 THE CONSTRUCTION OF SPACETIME

We have previously specifed [27] that the construction advocated here fails

in a (1+1) dimensional spacetime, but not in higher dimensions. Therefore

we will describe the general approach in (3+1) and then in (2+1) spacetime

dimensions. The actual transport model will use the latter.

An inertial frame speciﬁes a coordinate system with straight axes along
Minkowski (or M) orthogonal frame vectors e(a), a = 0, 1, 2, 3, satisfying
the conditions

where η(a, b) is given by

e(a)

e(b) = η(a, b),

Since this spacetime is ﬂat we can introduce a ﬁnite size radius vector r con-
necting a point in spacetime with the origin. This point has the coordinates
xa where

One can similarly introduce an arbitrary world vector u, expressed as a
linear combination of frame vectors, the coeﬃcients being the contravariant
components ua,

r =

xae(a).

X

u =

uae(a).

(It is useful to stress that changing frames means two things: changing
the frame vectors e(a), a = 0, 1, 2, 3, and the associated components of the
particular vectors. The components transform as contravariant components,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

February 2, 2008

(5)

while the frame vectors change as if their names,the labels (a) were covariant
indices.)
The scalar product of two world vectors u and v is immediately given
through their contravariant components as

u

v =

·

−

u0v0 + u1v1 + u2v2 + u3v3.

Our notation will be slightly inconsistent, denoting sometimes a world vector
in bold face as u, or by its components in a frame as ui, or just by u. Where
this would give rise to any ambiguity, we shall be precise.

The simplest lattices are cubic. Such a lattice can be constructed by select-
ing lattice points obtained through discrete translations of unit step-length
along the coordinate axes [27]. Then a general lattice point, indexed by the
integers (k, l, m, n), will have a radius vector r

r = ke(0) + le(1) + me(2) + ne(3).

(6)

Letting (k, l, m, n) run through all positive and negative integers, including

zero, a spacetime lattice is generated.

When will the lattice sites be unchanged under Lorentz transformations?

Consider a Lorentz transformation matrix with integer coeﬃcients. The

original quadruplet of integers (k, l, m, n, ) transforms into another quadru-

plet of integers (k

, l

, m

, n

). Thus, from the active point of view the trans-

′

′

′

′

formation shifts a lattice point into another lattice point; from the passive

point of view it relabels a ﬁxed lattice point. Thus the existence of an invari-

ant spacetime lattice depends on the existence of Lorentz transformations
speciﬁed by matrices with integer elements with respect to a particular set
of basis vectors.

Hence the new frame vectors are the vectors a, b, c, d with components
composed from the columns of the matrix. Since a Lorentz transformation

must preserve M orthonormality, the following conditions are imposed on

the matrix elements, expressed as conditions on the frame vectors:

−

b = c

c = d

d = 1

b = a

c = a

d =

c = b

d =

d = 0.

These conditions lead to Diophantine equations.

In two dimensions there are no solutions unless we use null coordinates; in

three dimensions – to which we now restrict the discussion – there are an

inﬁnity of solutions as indeed there are also in four dimensions. The one

containing the smallest positive integers is given by the matrix

L(1) = 

3 2 2



,

where the columns specify the frame vector components of the moving frame.

(Other solutions can be found in [27, 28]). The ﬁrst column corresponds

to a world velocity with components (1/√1
hence, in the example above, to a velocity √8/3 in units of the velocity of
light.

How are the time and length units to be obtained in the moving frame? In

the conventional case the marks denoting the units on the diﬀerent coordi-

nate axes are speciﬁed by the intersection of the coordinate axes with the

unit calibration - hyperboloids. The time axis intercepts the hyperboloid of

two sheets, while the two space-like axes intercept the hyperboloid of one

sheet. In the present case there is a lattice point at each of these intersec-

tions, and these lattice points are the nearest to the origin located on the

coordinate axes. Thus the conventional speciﬁcation of space and time units
is the same as taking the lattice point separation along each axis as the unit.
(One may view the construction of the spacetime lattice as seeking all those

points where the two length speciﬁcations coincide, the one through the

calibration hyperboloids, and the other through spacing equally the lattice

points on a coordinate axis, sliding them like beads.)

From L(1) we can generate three other Lorentz transformations satisfying

all conditions, Eqs. (8) and (9), by rotating the original spatial axes. This

results in four L transformations altogether; these are

4 DYNAMICAL QUANTITIES

1) Invariance in this lattice is a reduced relativistic invariance. It shall mean
invariance under transformations generated by the four discrete Lorentz

transformations constructed above, their powers and their products.

2) In this frame the components of the four possible hopping world velocities,
uA, (A = 1, 2, 3, 4; modulo 4) are given by the ﬁrst column of each of these
matrices. (Observe that capital letters refer to the name of the particular

world velocity, and not to components.)

Thus in this frame we ﬁnd the following values for the dynamical quantities
associated with a particle: energy = 3mc2, speed = (√8/3)c, magnitude
of momentum = √8mc. This is a very relativistic speed indeed; all other
solutions have even higher speeds. (We have chosen these world velocities

as fundamental, since any one of them can be reduced to rest by using one

3






of the basic Lorentz transformations.)

can be constructed.

For the present case a sort of one particle (or reduced) phase space lattice
(It is not a bona ﬁde phase space since there is no
symplectic form associated with this discrete manifold.) To each spacetime
lattice point we attach as arrows to the vertices, uA, A = 1, 2, 3, 4. Their tips
will lie on the upper sheet of unit hyperboloids hovering over each lattice

point. A microscopic dynamical state of a particle is speciﬁed by giving the

location of the lattice point (to ﬁx its spacetime position), and the tip of
′s. The evolution is now conceived by hopping from
one of the attached uA
tip to tip.

Three comments are in order. First, the previous considerations can be

extended to a four dimensional spacetime. An inﬁnity of solutions exist and

are reported elsewhere [28]. Second, more complicated spacetime lattices

can be generated that will increase isotropization in spacetime, and hence,

also in the lattice points on the space-like cuts. Third, we can increase

the isotropization in the world velocities (or world momenta) by applying

February 2, 2008

11

one or more allowed Lorentz transformations to any member of our original
uA set and interpreting the generated time-like unit vectors as additional
world velocities in the original frame (instead as the original vector in a new

frame). (These new world velocities still can be reduced to rest applying

products of our basic Lorentz transformations.) In the phase space picture

this would produce a larger set of arrows attached to each lattice point with

all tips touching each unit hyperboloid.

For these reasons the following Sections will be phrased in more general

terms and not restricted to the special case described above. However, where

appropriate we shall point out if the present model exhibits unexpected,

special or odd features.

5 MICRODYNAMICS

Lattice points can be populated by mass points having one of the four world

velocities; these mass points must jump to another lattice point at each it-

eration. The units used here make the mass and the speed of light unity;

thus, the world velocity is numerically equal to the world momentum. (No-

tice that here the variable labeling the evolution is the invariant iteration
number q, and not the time, which is one of the frame-dependent labels of
r. In the future we shall specify the location and iteration number together,

as r, q. The present simple model has the special feature that in this partic-

ular frame, each iteration advances the time by three units since the time
component of each uA is 3.)
Let the scalar quantity nA(r, q) be unity if the lattice point r is occupied
at the q’th iteration by a point with world velocity uA, and zero otherwise.
The evolution equation of the four discrete functions is given by

nA(r + uA, q + 1) = nA(r, q) + cA(r, q).

(11)

The ﬁrst term on the right describes pure streaming. The collision term,
cA(r, q), determines the state of aﬀairs at r + uA, q + 1 arising from the col-
lision at r, q. The collision must satisfy the conservation of world momenta.

February 2, 2008

12

In the present model this is enforced as follows. (For the non-relativistic
situation see ref. [29].) Only two points can collide, and only if the collision

is head on, and only if it results in a rebound with the spatial components of

the incoming world velocities turned ninety degrees (in this special frame!).
Thus, cA(r, q) is equal to the conﬁgurations producing a Gain minus the
conﬁgurations producing a Loss at r + uA, q + 1. Loss occurs when at r the
conﬁgurations with uA, uA+2 are occupied to produce a head-on collision
that will remove the point with uA. This can only happen if the conﬁg-
urations with uA+1, uA+3 are both unoccupied, to receive the points with
the turned incoming world velocities. Gain occurs when at r, q the conﬁg-
urations with uA+1, uA+3 are occupied, and uA, uA+2 are unoccupied. This
gives

It is an easy exercise to show that the two conservation laws of particle

are satisﬁed. The solution, nA(r, q), gives the most detailed microscopic

6 KINETIC THEORY

A diﬀerent description is provided by the precepts of kinetic theory using
a probabilistic approach. We can average nA in many diﬀerent ways, for
example, averaging over diﬀerent initial data, or averaging over spacetime
regions of various sorts, or assigning a priori probabilities to the occurrence
of the initial nA’s, etc. One arrives at four distribution functions fA(r, q), one
for each of the four world velocities, that specify the probability of ﬁnding
a point with world velocity uA at the lattice point r at a given iteration
number q. Thus, the distribution functions are attached to lattice points in
the discrete phase space, and consequently they are not densities in a phase
space as in the usual continuum theories.

What are the evolution equations of these functions? If (following Boltz-
mann) we neglect correlations between the diﬀerent nA’s, and average the
evolution equations of the nA’s, these equations become identical in form
with the evolution equations for the nA’s, simply replacing the latter by the
corresponding fA’s, i.e.,

fA(r + uA, q + 1) = fA(r, q) + cA(r, q).

are satisﬁed. The four coupled equations in Eq. 21 correspond to the rel-
ativistic Boltzmann equation. (There are four equations only, since in our
model there are only four world momenta, A = 1, 2, 3, 4 present instead of
a continuous range. In general there will be as many equations as there are
allowed world velocities.)
Given the starting data fA(r, 0) at the zeroth iteration, these equations
give us fA(r, q), the probability ﬁnding a particle with world velocity uA at
r, q. Observe that the starting data refer to the zeroth iteration and not to
time equal zero. The latter is a frame-dependent notion. It may happen,
however, that the averaging process itself tacitly introduces an initial frame

dependence; for example, averaging over initial data on a space-like, t =
0, plane. This often corresponds to the actual physical situation where
experiments are performed with the same setup at diﬀerent times in the
laboratory frame, and assuming that the setup is the same at each starting
time.

it does not have the physical dimensions of a density; we use it only to
distinguish it from n – which we introduce below – the size of the particle

ﬂow world vector (which does not have the physical dimensions of a density
either). Densities can naturally appear only in a continuum model or in
approximations to it.
Each ﬂow can also be written as the product of a scalar and a time-like unit
world vector. The scalar speciﬁes the strength of the ﬂow and the world

(30)

This introduces the strength of the particle ﬂow n, and its direction U i; the
strength of the entropy ﬂow ns; and its direction V i. It is important to stress
that we now have two diﬀerent and equally sensible invariant deﬁnitions of
a scalar quantity which qualify as a “particle density”, the strength n of the
particle ﬂow, and ρ, the latter being also equal to the (negative) trace of
the energy-momentum tensor. It is unclear which one is better suited as a
variable.
Other directions and strengths are speciﬁed through the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of the symmetric energy momentum tensor T ik. These are de-
ﬁned through the equations

TikAk = aηikAk.

(31)

There are three eigenvectors Ak, each with an associated eigenvalue a. Of
these, the most important is the direction W i and the strength ne, this
being the time-like eigenvector and its eigenvalue, giving rise to the energy
ﬂow world vector neW i. The two other eigenvectors are space-like with
eigenvalues giving the pressures P ′, P ′′. The two pressures are associated
with forces on surface elements with normals along the spatial projection of
the two space-like eigendirections. The quantities s and e are the invariant
entropy per particle, and the invariant energy per particle, using n as the
conversion factor between per lattice point and per particle, as is usual in
the continuum theory. In lattice models one may use with equal justice ρ as
the conversion factor, and specify another invariant entropy (per particle)
and invariant energy (per particle) as s

7 EQUILIBRIUM CONSIDERATIONS

According to this description, three time-like unit world vectors, U i, V i, W i
vie in principle to specify preferred directions. We show now that in full

February 2, 2008

16

thermal equilibrium there can only be one preferred direction, provided there
is only one set of dynamical conservation laws to be satisﬁed. In general, this
is the conservation of world momenta. (In the present model, however, one
has additional conservation laws.) Outside thermal equilibrium this need no
longer be the case, and more preferred directions may exist.
In the absence of external ﬁelds of force we expect that the stationary states
are homogeneous in spacetime, i.e., fA is independent of r. If this be so,
and if cA vanishes, evolution ceases; a stationary state is present.
If all
possible stationary states are simultaneously present, presumably thermal
equilibrium is reached. (The ﬁnal test is whether the entropy has reached
its maximum value given certain constraints. This, however, we will not
investigate here but take it for granted.)
The vanishing of cA requires the validity of the scalar relation

fAfA+2(1

(33)

From this it follows that

QA + QA+2 = QA+1 + QA+3,

where we have renamed the arguments of the log functions by Q. One
particular solution is given by

QA = α,

where α is a constant, independent of uA.
Consider now the conservation of world momentum in a pair collision,

Putting QA = β

where α is a scalar constant and βi is a constant world vector. The latter
can, of course, be written as the product of its magnitude and a unit world

Further statistical considerations are needed to determine the physical mean-

ing and values of these parameters from the given conditions, as the invariant

density ρ, (or n), and the invariant energy ne. One expects that α is pro-
portional to the chemical potential, while the world vector βi is related to
a time-like unit world vector describing the average ﬂow direction in space-

time, its magnitude being the reciprocal temperature. The details, however,

will depend on whether we deﬁne the invariant density via ρ, or via n. More-

over, at this stage it is not clear whether the ﬂux determined in this manner

can be reduced to rest through an allowed discrete Lorentz transformation,
or any combination of them. (One may observe that the fA given above
makes cA vanish even if α and βi are functions of r and q. However, in
this case the left hand side of Boltzmann’s equation need no longer vanish.

These “local equilibrium functions” are useful in studying diﬀerent possible

linearizations.)

Perhaps it is useful to stress that this derivation shows why in strict thermal
equilibrium, only one preferred direction, that of βi, can exist; thus the
spacetime directions of all ﬂuxes must coincide. This is the consequence of
the fact that in general only one vectorial conservation law can exist (the
conservation of world momentum in a pair collision). Thus its conversion

to a scalar expression requires the introduction of only one world vector.

If, however, there are additional conservation laws, this need not be the

February 2, 2008

18

case. Outside equilibrium, with irreversible processes present, new preferred

directions may arise.

An identical looking expression has been obtained in the non-relativistic

case, see [29]. There, however, the scalar product appearing is between

vectors in space, while here between world vectors. Consequently, the non-

relativistic result is not Galilean invariant (though it should be), while the

present one is Lorentz invariant.
In this simple model additional conserved quantities exist and they will
modify the equilibrium distribution. This occurs as follows. In the special

frame we ﬁnd

uA + uA+2 = 







, uA+1 + uA+3 = 

Thus, the line of collision of the incoming particles, and the lines of departure
of the rebounding ones lie in one plane, the collision plane, in which the com-
ponents of the sums of incoming and outgoing velocities vanish separately.
Multiply the ﬁrst sum with a world vector K whose time-like component
is zero but arbitrary otherwise; the second with the world vector K ′ whose
time-like component is zero but arbitrary otherwise. (Thus the world vectors
K, K ′ are space-like.) We get a new particular solution

QA = K

QA+2 = K
QA+1 = K ′

since the sum of the ﬁrst pair of Q’s is equal to the sum of the second pair

- as required - both being zero. Adding this new particular solution to the

previous ones we now obtain

fA = 1/[1 + exp(α + ((β + K)

uA))],

fA+2 = 1/[1 + exp(α + ((β + K)

·

·

As before, further considerations are needed to give physical meaning to the
K, K ′ vectors. At this stage the only condition on them is that they should
be space-like, lying in the collision plane. In the present model, therefore,

we expect that the thermalization process generates two groups of particles,

which thermalize within each group, but not the groups with each other.

However, even the word ‘thermalization’ is inappropriate. Thermalization

implies the existence of the notion of a temperature which manifests itself as

a spread in the energy distribution among the particles. Here, in the special

frame the zeroth component of all four world velocities are equal initially

and stay equal during collisions, and thus there is no spread in this frame.

Thermalization in the present model can only mean homogenization and

isotropization.
Further shortcomings of our simple model appear as well. The magnitudes
of the spatial velocities in this frame are all equal to each other, being 2√2.
Consequently, once a set of points separate from another set of points by

uniform streaming, they cannot mix again (unless walls, or periodic condi-

tions are applied), since no particle in one set is capable of catching up with

particles in the other set. This latter simpliﬁcation could be rectiﬁed.

8 NUMERICAL STUDIES

The simplicity of the model, the associated microdynamics, and the kinetic

theory can be exploited in numerical studies. Thus, one can study a variety

of problems both from the microdynamical and the kinetic point of view and

contrast the results. Moreover, in the latter we may use diﬀerent types of

averaging methods to study the similarities and diﬀerences. Here we shall

give a few examples of each. (More detailed studies are in progress, and

will be reported elsewhere). (In the ﬁgures the x position is always counted
from right to left. This allows a simple transcription of a 32 x positions

February 2, 2008

20

occupancy into a binary long word that the computer uses while iterating

particle propagation and collision.)

8.1 Frames

All ﬁgures, save the ﬁrst, depict the evolution of systems given in a preferred
frame in which the iteration number q coincides with the time component

of the radius vector of a point. By choosing another frame connected with

the ﬁrst by a Lorentz transformation, we would obtain a set of pictures
where the points present in a t′= constant plane would correspond to diﬀer-
ent iteration numbers. The fundamental world velocities in a general frame

would appear quite diﬀerent. Figure 1a shows the four fundamental world

velocities from the point of view of an observer boosted so that u3 is given

by (1, 0, 0), representing a particle at rest. In this ﬁgure we see clearly the

conservation requires that u

3. Since u
1 in this frame has
components (1, 0, 0), the last term in the sum appears to produce the small-

′

est possible deviation from lying in this plane.) Figure 1b shows how the

appearance of the evolution of the four ﬂuids, based on the four fundamental

world velocities, appear to shift with the boost.

The subsequent ﬁgures use the preferred frame. The points representing

particles start initially from the t = 0 plane, and develop according to the

equations given before. The result of each iteration therefore can be depicted

in the corresponding t = q plane. The appropriate iteration number, q, is

given next to each picture. The arrows present in the pictures indicate the

spatial directions of the four fundamental velocities.

8.2 Examples of microscopic evolution

On this level the relevant object to be investigated is nA(r, q). This describes
the actual microdynamical evolution of particles on the spacetime lattice

February 2, 2008

21

starting from nA(r, 0). Figure 2a depicts the head-on collision of two sets
of points initially separated. Each group occupies half the lattice points
96 square, chosen at random elaborate. Within each square the
world velocities are uniform, advancing the squares towards each other, but

of a 96

×

with diﬀerent edge orientations as shown at the zero’th iteration. After 40

iterations the collision of the squares is in full bloom, and after 80 iterations

one ﬁnds four separate groups, each containing only one particular world

velocity, and streaming apart accordingly. The pictures show the profound

diﬀerences in the collisions generated by the interplay of the orientation

– which regulates the arrangement of the overlap regions in the collision

– and the preferred diagonal directions present in the collision mechanism

where the incoming and outgoing directions are along the diagonals. The

turning mechanism in the collision can, however, only become eﬀective if

the outgoing diagonal connects sites not yet occupied, thus depending on

the overlap.

In edge-on collisions there is a large overlap region at the start of the colli-

sion which generates a spillout along the diagonal direction. This liberates
sites to allow the turning process in the collision to operate well, generating

increasing spillout, and so on. Finally we see the four well separated ﬁnal

regions. (We have brieﬂy discussed at the end of Section 7 why this division

into four, well separated, free streaming regions is the consequence of the

model.)

In corner-on collisions the transverse ﬂow is conﬁned because in this con-

ﬁguration the initial target area is diminished and, in addition, the new

incoming points impede the turning mechanism. Eventually the collisions

do produce points with new world velocities, and the system again breaks

up into four ﬁnal parts, each homogeneous in the world velocities. (It is

amusing to see how some of the sharp edges are preserved. This arises be-

cause during the collision of the squares these edges advance as a common

front in each step, covering up precisely the new points spilling out due to

the collision.)

Figure 2b shows the same arrangement in a four square collision. Here

February 2, 2008

22

the large degree of symmetry does not enable one to distinguish the ﬁnal

spillout regions from the others. Moreover, in the corner-on collision the

conspiracy of the symmetries in the diagonals and edges ﬁnally generate

only an exchange of world velocities in the diagonally opposite regions.

One may investigate how the occupancy in the initial conﬁgurations inﬂu-

ences these results. Figure 3a demonstrates the eﬀects of the initial occupa-

tion density on the post-collision conﬁgurations (q = 80) in the two square

collisions. The left column refers to edge-on collisions, the right column to

the corner-on collisions. In the ﬁrst row the occupation fraction in the initial

squares was 1/3, in the second row 2/3, in the third row 1.

Figure 3b is arranged in an identical fashion, showing the eﬀects of occu-

pancy in a post collision conﬁguration (q = 80) for four square collisions.

An interesting feature is the inﬂuence of the occupancy in the edge-on col-

lisions. For very small occupancy the trailing regions are small (since for

single occupancy this region must vanish). For full occupancy all edges are

sharp, no trailing region exists. Consequently, there must exist one or more

partial occupancy numbers for which the trailing region is a maximum.

8.3 Kinetic examples

There are many diﬀerent questions and problems one can investigate using

the kinetic approach. Some of these we shall mention later. Here we take

up only one special case.

Figure 4a shows the microscopic evolution of points in a rectangle, i.e., the
functions nA(r, q).
by each of the four diﬀerent world velocities, also chosen at random. Thus

Initially 1/8 of the locations are occupied at random

half the points in the initial rectangle are occupied. After ten iterations

the square increases in size, and nine regions can be distinguished in it,

according to the number of diﬀerent fundamental world velocities in it. The

central region has points with all four velocities present; such a region we

call phase III. The regions at each four corners is phase I, containing points
with only one of the four basic velocities. These pure regions are connected

February 2, 2008

23

by regions of phase II with diﬀering sizes, where the adjoining velocities

are mixed pairwise. These regions separate during the evolution and the

mixed regions progressively disappear. (Phases III and the small phase II

disappear at q = 16, while the large phase II disapears at q = 32.)
We now conceive an ensemble where each member has diﬀerent initial data
chosen randomly in the same manner. Diﬀerent averages over the ensemble

will generate diﬀerent distribution functions. From any one of them we can

construct all the relevant average quantities discussed before. Hence, in

principle, we can compare the diﬀerent quantities obtained. There are the

following quantities to be compared:
a) nA(r, q), the solution of the microscopic equations, advancing the initial
data nA(r, 0);
b) fA(r, q), the solution of the kinetic equation, advancing the initial data
obtained by averaging nA(r, 0);
c) FA(r, q), the average of nA(r, q).
The quantities nA(r, q) give the complete microscopic description. (In the
present case this is given in Figure 4a for one particular member of the en-
semble). The functions FA(r, q) give the most correct average description,
through averaging the precise microscopic description for each member of
the ensemble at the iteration q. The functions fA(r, q) give the kinetic de-
scription. Here, following Gibbs, we average over the initial data nA(r, 0)
within the ensemble, and then evolve this average via Boltzmann’s equa-

tion. (One could also use an initial average of one particular member of the

ensemble over given “small, but not too small” spacetime regions, following

Boltzmann’s ideas, and pursue the evolution of this distribution function.

This we shall not do here.)

In Figures 4b, and 4c we show the behavior of some of these statistical

averages computed in this manner. In principle, all ensemble averages still

depend on the location r, and iteration number q. To simplify our pictures

we will eventually also perform an additional averaging over sites occupied

at each iteration. To gain further insight we shall do this averaging in two

stages. First we average over the occupied sites in each phase separately.

February 2, 2008

24

These averages will be denoted by the square brackets, [
·

]. Then we average

over all the occupied sites by using the averages over the ﬂuid in this phase

and multiplying each with the fraction the phase was represented in the total

number of occupied sites. These averages will be denoted by the pointed

brackets, <

>.

·

In ﬁgure 4b there are several average quantities shown as a function of the

iteration number q. The solid curve indicates the quantity averaged over

phase III, the dashed curve an average over phase II, the dotted curve

an average over phase I. (The solid and dashed lines terminate at those

iterations where the overlap generating the phase ceases.) The last graph in

the ﬁgure shows the fractional occupancy. The dashed line shows the frac-

tional occupancy in Phase III. There are two types of Phase II regions,
large ones and small ones.(See, e.g., Figure 4a, q = 10.) The small over-
lap regions disappear after 16 iterations, the large one after 32 iterations.

Their fractional occupancy is shown by the dashed and by the dashed-dotted

curves respectively. (Since both the large and small Phase II regions con-

tribute equally to the overlap region in the [
] averages no distinction had
·
to be made between these averages, hence no dashed-dotted lines appear.)

We notice that all average quantities jump immediately, with one iteration,

to a stationary value. This arises since the initial values were so random

that the phases immediately reached thermal equilibrium; only their mixing

ratios could change during evolution.
Figure 4c shows as a function of q, the average magnitudes per occupied site
of the two diﬀerently deﬁned invariant particle numbers, < ρ >, < n >, the

entropy and energy ﬂows < ns >,< ne >, and the site-averaged pressures
in the x and y directions, < Px >, < Py >. (In this case the associated
space-like eigendirections are along the x and y directions.) All quantities

are averaged over the contributing sites, including all the diﬀerent phases

together. For these quantities, in this particular case, there are no diﬀerences

visible whether we use the f functions or the F functions, showing the good

quality of the kinetic approximation.
The situation is somewhat diﬀerent for the normalized directions of the ﬂows.

February 2, 2008

25

Instead of plotting them we shall only plot in Figure 4d the magnitudes of

the squared diﬀerences.
(These are symmetric in their arguments.) For
example, the diﬀerence between the particle ﬂow direction U i and entropy
ﬂow direction V i is deﬁned as
Vi) = 2(1+U iVi), with (U iUi =
−
V iVi =
1). This diﬀerence (averaged) is denoted by < δ(s, n) >, or <
∆(s, n) >, depending whether we evaluate it using the f , or F distribution

V i)(Ui

(U i

−

−

functions. The other diﬀerences are similarly deﬁned. The labels n, s, e in

the ﬁgures refer to the associated ﬂows.

8.4 Equation of state

Figures 4b and 4c have shown values for the pressures on planes normal

to the two spatial directions. Figures 5a, b show typical graphs used in the

construction of an equation of state associated with this model. Figure 5a

uses the distribution function f (r, q), while 5b uses the function F (r, q). The
two pressures Px, Py and the energy density ne are thus functions of r and
q. Here we see their relation at diﬀerent lattice points at the q = 5 iteration.

The values of both pressures are indicated on the vertical axis, the energy

density on the horizontal one. In each picture four clouds of points appear

associated with the regions of diﬀerent phases (velocity mixtures). The

small cloud at the origin depicts pure velocity phases, where both pressures

vanish. (On the scale of the ﬁgure this cloud is invisible.) The large cloud
has all phases present. The two regions where only two velocities mix are
disjoint, since in these regions the energy densities are the same, but Px
is zero while Py is not. These regions have a ﬁnite size due to the ﬁnite
number of initial data in the ensemble. These sizes also depend whether

we use f (r, q), or F (r, q) in the averaging, since each distribution function

gives rise to diﬀerent ﬂuctuations. As the number of initial data increases,

the diﬀerent regions reduce in size, converging towards four points, given

a density. Consequently, varying the density we ﬁnally generate four lines
giving the equation of state. (Two of these line coincide, giving Px = 0 for
both.) We thus obtain

Px = 0,

9 OUTLOOK AND FURTHER QUESTIONS

The above discussion and examples show that a relativistic lattice automa-

ton describing relativistic ﬂuid ﬂows can be constructed. One is able to
confront directly the microdynamics, i.e., the actual relativistic evolution
with the one computed from the kinetic model. This may enable us to in-

vestigate both general and particular questions. Some of these are listed

below.
a) To proceed, more realistic models and initial data are needed. We may
improve the collision mechanism in order to destroy the additional constants

of the motion, and to generate a spread in the particle energies. This will

require the use of more than four fundamental world velocities, and, possibly,

diﬀerent spacetime lattices as well.

February 2, 2008

27

b) Given this, we can evaluate in more appealing models the various quanti-

ties containing sums over A, using the three diﬀerent distribution functions
(nA, fA, FA) and compare them with each other to study the quality of the
approximations involved in using averages, and using the kinetic equation

(as we have done brieﬂy in ﬁgure 3c). This may show the validity and range

of the diﬀerent assumptions entering the kinetic theory and its linearized

approximations;

it can also exhibit the fruitfulness (or otherwise) of the

diﬀerent deﬁnitions used. For example, what time-like unit vector should

be chosen (if any) to describe the “hydrodynamical ﬂow”; whether n, or ρ

should be used as the invariant occupation number on a site, etc.
c) Of special interest are questions connected with the entropy. The mi-
croscopic entropy ﬂux is identically zero, because the logarithmic terms
identically vanish (on account of nA being either unity or zero). This van-
ishing is indeed appropriate, the entropy being a statistical notion. There

remain, however, still two statistical entropy ﬂux deﬁnitions, using either
the FA(r, q), or the fA functions! The one deﬁned through F is the actual
entropy ﬂux, the other is its kinetic approximation. How will these two dif-
ferent entropy ﬂuxes diﬀer, and how will they result in a diﬀerent entropy

production?

The entropy production itself is an important problem. We mention here

two particular classes of questions.

For the entropy deﬁned through the f functions, the Boltzmann equation

insures the existence of an H theorem (for conﬁned systems, or inﬁnite sys-
tems) on the kinetic level. There exists, however, in this case no microscopic
entropy ﬂux using the n functions, and therefore no H theorem. What will

then happen if we compare the long term solutions (large iteration num-

bers) of the microscopic equation, via an entropy deﬁned through the F
functions, (i.e., the correctly evolved, averaged n functions), with the equi-
librium solutions? Disparities should exist due to the approximate nature of

the kinetic evolution. Boltzmann himself conjectured long ago that ﬂuctua-

tions of the true entropy should arise even in equilibrium. Will the entropy

deﬁned through F verify this conjecture? We expect so.

February 2, 2008

28

All irreversible processes are linked to entropy production. To specify, how-
ever, macroscopic irreversible processes linked to this entropy production,
macroscopic irreversible ﬂuxes and its driving “forces” must be introduced.

These are eventually connected by coeﬃcients, displaying symmetry prop-
erties, the Onsager relations, exhibited by macroscopic time reversal argu-
ments [30]. In conventional relativistic hydrodynamics this step and its con-

sequences generate great diﬃculties, and contradictory results. The usual
kinetic approach, based on the solutions of the kinetic equations near equi-
librium has not resolved the diﬃculties. Another basic problem is to ﬁnd the
correct relativistic Onsager relations, which would then lead to hyperbolic
equations describing the irreversible processes.
It seems to be essential to ﬁnd an invariant small parameter. This is where
much of the previous work, imitating Chapman and Enskog in a relativistic
context, has diﬃculties. We conjecture that there exists a mean free iteration
number corresponding to the mean free time in the non-relativistic case. The
small parameter may then be the ratio of the iteration number over the mean

free iteration number, or some other quantity related to them.
d) Conservation Orbits

one such point at each iteration the successive points generate an orbit in
spacetime. (These points need not be unique; for example if fA is indepen-
dent of r, as in equilibrium, there will be an inﬁnite number of them.) With

10 SUMMARY

We have shown how one can construct spacetime lattices using the discrete

subgroups of the Poincar´e group, and deﬁne over them a dynamics that is as

relativistic as possible replacing a continuous group of transformations with

a discrete one. Then, using the simplest example we exhibit such a dynamics

with contact interactions at the lattice sites, using both a detailed micro-

dynamics and its kinetic approximation based on an associated Boltzmann

equation. Apart from some analytical results we also showed numerical ones

representing simple collisions. Finally, we have oﬀered some questions for

future work.

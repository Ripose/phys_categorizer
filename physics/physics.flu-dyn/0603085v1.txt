On the eﬀects of turbulence on a screw dynamo

(Received 12 December 2005; in ﬁnal form 7 March 2006)

In an experiment in the Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics in Perm (Russia) an non–stationary screw dynamo is intended to be
realized with a helical ﬂow of liquid sodium in a torus. The ﬂow is necessarily turbulent, that is, may be considered as a mean ﬂow and
a superimposed turbulence. In this paper the induction processes of the turbulence are investigated within the framework of mean–ﬁeld
electrodynamics. They imply of course a part which leads to an enhanced dissipation of the mean magnetic ﬁeld. As a consequence
of the helical mean ﬂow there are also helical structures in the turbulence. They lead to some kind of α–eﬀect, which might basically
support the screw dynamo. The peculiarity of this α–eﬀect explains measurements made at a smaller version of the device envisaged
for the dynamo experiment. The helical structures of the turbulence lead also to other eﬀects, which in combination with a rotational
shear are potentially capable of dynamo action. A part of them can basically support the screw dynamo. Under the conditions of the
experiment all induction eﬀects of the turbulence prove to be rather weak in comparison to that of the main ﬂow. Numerical solutions of
the mean–ﬁeld induction equation show that all the induction eﬀects of the turbulence together let the screw dynamo threshold slightly,
at most by one per cent, rise. The numerical results give also some insights into the action of the individual induction eﬀects of the
turbulence.

Keywords: Dynamo experiment, mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics

1 Introduction

A screw–like, that is, helical motion of an electrically conducting ﬂuid is capable of dynamo action. This
has been ﬁrst theoretically shown by Ponomarenko (1973). Later, in 1999, it was experimentally demon-
strated in the liquid sodium facility of the Institute for Physics in Riga (Latvia) (Gailitis et al. 2000,
2001a,b, 2002a,b, 2003, 2004). It is also the background of another liquid sodium experiment which is
under preparation in the Institute for Continuous Media Mechanics in Perm (Russia) (Denisov et al. 1999,
Frick et al. 2001, 2002) (Denisov et al. 1999, Frick et al. 2001, 2002).

In this experiment a torus-shaped vessel ﬁlled with liquid sodium is rotated about its symmetry axis
and then suddenly stopped. After the stop a ﬂow of sodium occurs inside the vessel and decays in the
course of time. Due to diverters, that is, proper arrangements of blades inside the vessel, the ﬂow becomes
helical. In this way the possibility of a dynamo of Ponomarenko type arises for a certain time interval.
The large radius of the torus is about 0.40 m and the small one about 0.12 m. Rotation rates up to 50 rps
are envisaged. Estimates show that magnetic Reynolds numbers suﬃcient for dynamo action are indeed
feasible.

The critical magnetic Reynolds number is deﬁnitely higher than 10. For liquid sodium the hydrodynamic
Reynolds number exceeds the magnetic Reynolds number by a factor of about 105. Therefore in the case
of a dynamo the ﬂuid ﬂow is necessarily turbulent, that is, may be considered as consisting of a main ﬂow
and a superimposed turbulence. The turbulence aﬀects the dynamo in two ways. Firstly it inﬂuences the
proﬁle of the main ﬂow. Secondly it leads to small–scale induction eﬀects. In particular the turbulence
will enlarge the eﬀective magnetic diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid, what raises the dynamo threshold. Likewise
other small–scale induction eﬀects will occur. As a consequence of helical features of the turbulence an
α–eﬀect or related eﬀects are possible. Basically they could also support the screw dynamo or even open
the possibility of another type of dynamo.

Karl-Heinz R¨adler & Rodion Stepanov

In this paper we want to estimate these direct inﬂuences of turbulence on the electromagnetic ﬁeld on the
basis of mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics. We will rely on a recent general calculation of the mean electromotive
force due to turbulence (R¨adler and Stepanov 2005), which was partially motivated by this experiment. In
section 2 we describe the general concept of our investigation. In section 3 we discuss possible structures
of the mean electromotive force which can be concluded from symmetry arguments, and in section 4 we
explain results of more detailed calculations. On this basis we deliver in section 5 estimates for the inﬂuence
of the turbulence on the dynamo. Finally in section 6 the main results are summarized.

2 The mean–ﬁeld concept

Let us ﬁrst recall some ideas of the mean–ﬁeld concept which are important for the following (see, e.g.,
Krause and R¨adler 1971, Moﬀatt 1978, R¨adler 2000). We start from the induction equation that governs
the behavior of the magnetic ﬁeld B in an electrically conducting ﬂuid,

∂tB − ∇ × (U × B) − η∇2B = 0 , ∇ · B = 0 .

Here U is the velocity of the ﬂuid and η its magnetic diﬀusivity, which is assumed to be constant.

The velocity U and, as a consequence, also the magnetic ﬁeld B are assumed to consist of large–scale
parts and small–scale turbulent ﬂuctuations. We deﬁne the mean magnetic and velocity ﬁelds B and U as
averages over space or time scales larger than those of the turbulence and put B = B + b analogously to
U = U + u. We assume that the Reynolds averaging rules apply. Taking the average of equation (1) we
obtain the mean-ﬁeld induction equation

∂tB − ∇ × (U × B + E) − η∇2B = 0 , ∇ · B = 0 ,

where E is an electromotive force due to the ﬂuctuations of magnetic ﬁeld and velocity,

E = u × b .

The equation for b resulting from (1) and (2) allows us to conclude that E is determined by U, u and B.
More precisely, E at a given point in space and time depends not only on U, u and B at this point but also
on their behavior in a certain neighborhood of this point. We adopt the frequently used assumption that
B varies only weakly in space and time so that E in a given point depends on B only via its components
and their ﬁrst spatial derivatives in this point. Then E can be represented in the form

Ei = aij Bj + bijk ∂Bj/∂xk ,

with tensors aij and bijk being averaged quantities determined by U and u. Here and in the following we
refer to a Cartesian co–ordinate system (x1, x2, x3) and adopt the summation convention. Relation (4) is
equivalent to

E = −α ◦ B − γ × B

−β ◦ (∇ × B) − δ × (∇ × B) − κ ◦ (∇B)(s)

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(see R¨adler 1980, 2000), where α and β are symmetric tensors of the second rank, γ and δ are vectors,
and κ is a tensor of the third rank, all depending on U and u only. (∇B)(s) is the symmetric part of the
gradient tensor of B, i.e. (∇B)(s)
2 (∂Bj/∂xk + ∂Bk/∂xj ). Notations like α ◦ B or κ ◦ (∇B)(s) are used
in the sense of (α ◦ B)i = αijBj or (κ ◦ (∇B)(s))i = κijk((∇B)(s))jk. The term with α in (5) describes the
α–eﬀect, which is in general anisotropic, that with γ a transport of mean magnetic ﬂux by the turbulence.
The terms with β and δ can be interpreted by introducing a modiﬁed magnetic diﬀusivity, again in general
anisotropic. They are usually accompanied by the κ term, which allows no simple interpretation.

3 The structure of the mean electromotive force E in the presence of a screw motion

On the eﬀects of turbulence on a screw dynamo

3

3.1 Mean motion

We consider the Ponomarenko dynamo here in its original cylindrical geometry. As observed in other
investigations this provides a reasonable approximation for the situation in a torus even for aspect ratios
as large as in the planned device (Stepanov 2000). We assume that it is primarily a helical mean ﬂow
described by the mean velocity U which generates or maintains the mean magnetic ﬁeld B. Referring to
a proper cylindrical co–ordinate system (r, ϕ, z) we put

U = (0, U ϕ(r), U z(r)) , U ϕ = Ω(r)r .

(6)

As mentioned above we will study the inﬂuence of the turbulence, that is, of the velocity ﬁeld u, on the
mean magnetic ﬁeld B in the framework of mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics.

For a more detailed discussion of the mean electromotive force E caused by the turbulence and for its
calculation we change temporarily from the frame of reference in which (6) applies to another one rotating
about the axis r = 0 and moving along it. Let us consider E in a given point at the surface r = r0.
The moving frame is then ﬁxed such that the mean velocity of the ﬂuid at the surface r = r0 is equal to
zero. The result for E found in this rotating system, considered as a vector with the usual transformation
properties, applies in the original frame of reference as well. In the moving frame the mean velocity U has,
again in the cylindrical co–ordinate system introduced above, the form

U = (0, (Ω(r) − Ω(r0))r, U z(r) − U z(r0)) .

In contrast to the original frame, in the rotating one a Coriolis force occurs, which is deﬁned by an angular
velocity Ω, given by

where ˆz means the unit vector in the z direction of the cylindrical co–ordinate system.

Ω = Ω(r0) ˆz ,

(7)

(8)

3.2 Homogeneous turbulence

Consider now E in the moving frame at a point with U = 0. Then E and so the quantities aij and bijk,
or α, γ, β, δ and κ, depend on U and u in a certain neighborhood of this point. The dependence on u
implies again a dependence on U and of course also a dependence on Ω. We restrict our attention now to
the case in which U varies only weakly in the relevant neighborhood and assume that its behavior can be
there suﬃciently precisely described by the gradient tensor ∇U, with respect to Cartesian co–ordinates
deﬁned by (∇U)ij = ∂U i/∂xj. In addition we assume until further notice that the turbulent ﬂuctuations u
deviate from a homogeneous isotropic mirror–symmetric turbulence only as a consequence of the gradient
∇U of U and the Coriolis force deﬁned by Ω. We may split ∇U into its symmetric and antisymmetric
parts. The ﬁrst one is the rate of strain tensor D, that is, Dij = 1
2 (∂U i/∂xj + ∂U j/∂xi). It describes the
deforming motion near the point considered. Due to the incompressibility of the ﬂuid we have ∇ · U = 0
and therefore Dii = 0. The second part, A, given by Aij = 1
2 (∂U i/∂xj − ∂U j/∂xi), corresponds to a rigid
body rotation of the ﬂuid near this point. We may represent it according to Aij = − 1
2 ǫijlWl by a vector
W = ∇ × U. Until further notice we do not use speciﬁcations of D and W according to (7). They will be
introduced only later.

We now utilize the symmetry properties of the basic equations governing B and U, or B, U, b and
u, from which E and so the quantities aij and bijk, or α, γ, β, δ and κ, have to be derived. They allow
two important conclusions (see also, e.g., R¨adler and Stepanov 2005). The ﬁrst reads that these quantities
cannot contain any other construction elements than the isotropic tensors δlm and ǫlmn, the vectors Ω
and W and the tensor D. The second uses the distinction between polar and axial vectors as U and B,

respectively, and between true and pseudo tensors. It reads that aij and bijk, further α and κ are pseudo
tensors, β is a true tensor, γ a polar vector, and δ an axial vector. It is then important that Ω and W
are axial vectors and D is a true tensor.

Let us consider ﬁrst αij and γi. The mentioned construction elements δlm, ǫlmn, Ω, W and D allow us

neither to built a pseudo tensor of the second rank nor a polar vector. That is, we have

αij = 0 ,

γi = 0 .

(9)

We stress that this applies independently of any assumptions concerning linearity in Ω, W and D like
those we will introduce below.

In contrast to this there are several non–zero contributions to βij, δi and κijk. For the sake of simplicity

we give here only those of them which are linear in Ω, W and D,

βij = β(0)δij + β(D)Dij ,

δi = δ(Ω)Ωi + δ(W )Wi ,

κijk =

κ(Ω)(Ωjδik + Ωkδij) +

κ(W )(Wjδik + Wkδij) + κ(D)(ǫijlDkl + ǫiklDjl) .

(10)

The coeﬃcients β(0), β(D), δ(Ω), · · · κ(D) are determined by u but do not depend on Ω, W and D. Because
of ∇ · B = 0, terms of κijk containing δjk would not contribute to E and have therefore been dropped.

As a consequence of (9) and (10) we have

E = −β(0)∇ × B − β(D)D ◦ (∇ × B)

−(δ(Ω)Ω + δ(W )W) × (∇ × B)
−(κ(Ω)Ω + κ(W )W) ◦ (∇B)(s) − κ(D) ˆκ(D) ◦ (∇B)(s) ,

(11)

where ˆκ(D) is a tensor of the third rank deﬁned by ˆκijk = ǫijlDlk + ǫiklDlj.

The β(0) and β(D) terms in (11) make that the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity deviates from the original, that
is, molecular magnetic diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid. Due to the β(D) term the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity becomes
anisotropic. The δ(Ω) and δ(W ) terms, too, can be discussed as contributions to the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity.
They lead to skew–symmetric contributions to the diﬀusivity tensor. In another context the eﬀect described
by the δ(Ω) term has been called “Ω × J–eﬀect”. It has been shown that this eﬀect in combination with
a diﬀerential rotation, here a dependence of Ω or r, is able to establish a dynamo (R¨adler 1969, Roberts
1972, Moﬀatt and Proctor 1982, R¨adler et al. 2003). The δ(W ) term describes an eﬀect analogous to the
Ω×J–eﬀect, which has been revealed only recently (Rogachevskii and Kleeorin 2003, R¨adler and Stepanov
2005). It occurs even in the absence of the Coriolis force as consequence of a shear in the mean motion. The
possibility of a dynamo due to this eﬀect is still under debate, see section 5.3. We refrain from discussing
the κ(Ω), κ(W ) and κ(D) terms here.

3.3 Inhomogeneous turbulence

Let us now relax the assumption that the original turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic. We admit an
inhomogeneity and an anisotropy due to a gradient of the turbulence intensity and introduce a vector g
in the direction of this gradient by putting ∇u2 = gu2. Then we have to add g, which is a polar vector,
to the above–mentioned construction elements of αij, γi, βij, δi and κijk. As a consequence α and γ can
well be non-zero. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the inﬂuence of g on α, β, γ, δ and κ is so
weak that they are at most of ﬁrst order in g. We have then

αij = α(Ω)

(g · Ω)δij + α(Ω)

(giΩj + gjΩi) + α(W )

(g · W)δij + α(W )

(13)

where ˆα(g, D) is a symmetric tensor deﬁned by ˆαij = (ǫilmDlj + ǫjlmDli)gm. In the following the induction
eﬀects described by the individual contributions to E are called α(Ω)–eﬀect, α(W )–eﬀect, · · · κ(D)–eﬀect or,
more summarizing, α–eﬀects, β–eﬀects, · · · κ–eﬀects.

The occurrence of an α–eﬀect as a consequence of the gradient of the turbulence intensity and the Coriolis
force, that is, of g and Ω, is known for a long time. The possibility of an α–eﬀect due to a combination
of g and W, or of g and D, has however been revealed only recently (Rogachevskii and Kleeorin 2003,
R¨adler and Stepanov 2005). Likewise the γ–eﬀect and its modiﬁcation by the Coriolis force, that is Ω,
is known for a long time, but modiﬁcations by W and D have been found only in the last–mentioned
investigations.

3.4 α–eﬀect

We still remain in the co–moving frame deﬁned above, in which U is given by (7), and consider a point
with r = r0. As a consequence of (7) both W and D take speciﬁc forms. The non–zero components of
W are Wϕ = −dU z/dr and Wz = rdΩ/dr. As can be concluded with the help of the relations in the
Appendix the only non–zero elements of D are Drϕ = Dϕr = r
2 dU z/dr. As for
Ω we refer to (8).

2 dΩ/dr and Drz = Dzr = 1

In view of the Perm dynamo experiment the simplest assumption on g is that it is a radial vector. In this
disappear. In the cylindrical

case the tensor α has a remarkable peculiarity. The terms with α(Ω)
co–ordinate system α has the form

and α(W )

where U ϕ and U z are, of course, measured in the rotating frame of reference. All diagonal elements of α
are equal to zero. Therefore a mean magnetic ﬁeld in z direction does not generate any mean electromotive
force in ϕ or z direction. The last statement remains true even if we relax the assumption on linearity with
respect to g.

In this context experiments with torus–shaped devices similar to but smaller than that prepared for
the dynamo experiment are of interest. In an experiment with water instead of sodium clearly helical

small-scale motions have been observed (Frick et al. 2002). This suggests the existence of an α–eﬀect in
the conducting ﬂuid. In the case of a complete α–eﬀect an azimuthal mean magnetic ﬁeld leads to a mean
electromotive force with a non–zero azimuthal component. However, our above result concerning α, with
the z direction interpreted as the azimuthal one, does not predict such a component. The existence of
helical motions alone is not suﬃcient for the occurrence of a complete α–eﬀect. Another experiment with
gallium instead of sodium was carried out, too (Noskov et al. 2004). It clearly conﬁrmed that there is
indeed no azimuthal electromotive force or electric current due to an azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld.

Our considerations on the structure of the electromotive force E did not provide us with relations between
the coeﬃcients α(Ω)
, · · ·, κ(D) and the parameters of the turbulent ﬂow. We rely here on recent
calculations of these coeﬃcients presented in detail in a paper by R¨adler and Stepanov (2005). They were
carried out just under the restrictions introduced above, namely that E is only weakly inﬂuenced by the
Coriolis force and the gradient of the mean velocity so that it is linear in Ω, W and D. In addition, again
in the sense of restrictions already made, it was assumed that all mean quantities determining E vary only
weakly in space and time so that it is also linear in the operator ∇ acting on quantities like u2 or B, and
contains no time derivatives of them. Finally the second–order correlation approximation was used. In this
approximation the velocity correlation tensor vij of the second rank,

vij(R, T ; r, t) = ui(R + r/2, T + t/2)uj(R − r/2, T − t/2) ,

plays a central part. The calculations have partially been carried out in the Fourier space, and the Fourier–
transformed correlation tensor ˜vij has been used, deﬁned such that

vij(R, T ; r, t) =

˜vij(R, T ; k, ω) exp(i(k · r) − ωt) d3k dω .

Z Z

The “original” turbulence, which occurs in the limit of vanishing Coriolis force and vanishing gradient of
the mean motion, is assumed to deviate from a homogeneous isotropic and mirror–symmetric one only by
a gradient of its intensity. The corresponding Fourier–transformed correlation tensor ˜vij was assumed to
have the form

˜vij(R, T ; k, ω) =

with some function W describing the kinetic energy distribution in the Fourier space. It was chosen such
that

c − t/|τc|) ,

(18)

where u2 describes the turbulence intensity in the limit of vanishing Coriolis force and mean velocity
gradient, and λc and τc are correlation length and time in this limit.

The results for the coeﬃcients α(Ω)

, · · ·, κ(D) can be represented with the help of the Prandtl
number Pm of the ﬂuid, the magnetic Reynolds number Ru of the turbulent motion and a dimensionless
parameter q,

5 The eﬀect of turbulence in the Perm dynamo device

5.1 Estimates of the turbulence eﬀects

Let us make a few estimates of the turbulence eﬀects to be expected in the Perm dynamo device on
the basis of the general form (13) of the mean electromotive force E, the relations (20) and (21), and
numerical values represented in table 1. As for the properties of the liquid sodium we put η = 0.1m2/s
and Pm = 10−5. As a typical value U of the mean velocity U we use U = 50m/s. For the velocity u of the
turbulent motion, the correlation length λc and the correlation time τc we assume u = 1m/s, λc = 0.01 m
and τc = 0.05 s. This implies Ru = 0.1 and q = 0.02. Further |g| is estimated by 1/R, where R means the
radius of the ﬂuid cylinder. Likewise |Ω|, |W| and |D| are estimated by U/R, and spatial derivatives of B
by B/R. We put R = 0.12m.

Relation (13) for E ignores any time variation of B. Since we are in the limit of small q this is justiﬁed
c/η, with the above data 10−3s.
as long as the characteristic time of this variation is large compared to λ2
The calculations described below show that this characteristic time is not smaller than 10−2 so that this
condition is satisﬁed.

Consider ﬁrst the β–eﬀects, which may be interpreted by introducing a mean–ﬁeld version of the magnetic
diﬀusivity instead of the molecular diﬀusivity η. This mean–ﬁeld version is in general a tensor, ηm ij =

(η + β(0))δij + β(D)Dij. The contribution of the β(0)–eﬀect to the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity, measured in
u. With the above data it takes a value of about 10−3. The corresponding
units of η, is β(0)/η = ˜β(0)R2
contribution of the β(D)–eﬀect is of the order of β(D)U/ηR = ˜β(D)(U R/η) (λc/R)2R2
u, with the above data
about 1.3 · 10−2.

It is natural to compare the γ–eﬀects, which describe a transport of mean magnetic ﬂux, with that of the
mean velocity U. As for the γ(0)–eﬀect we ﬁnd that |γ(0)g|/|U| is of the order of γ(0)/U R = ˜γ(0)(η/U R) R2
u,
which takes a value of about 10−5. In analogous estimates for the γ(Ω), γ(W ) and γ(D)–eﬀects the ratios
corresponding to γ(0)/U R are γ(Ω)/R2, γ(W )/R2 and γ(D)/R2, all being independent of U . The ﬁrst two
are smaller than the last one, which is about 4 · 10−4.

We may also compare the α, δ and κ–eﬀects with that of the mean velocity U. They are then characterized
by the ratios α(Ω)

We may conclude from these estimates that the inﬂuence of turbulence on the screw dynamo in the
Perm experiment should be rather small. There is hardly the possibility of another type of dynamo, which
would become possible by turbulence eﬀects.

5.2 Dynamo model

Some more detailed numerical investigations concerning the eﬀects of turbulence on the screw dynamo
have been carried out, mainly with the intention to ﬁnd out in which sense they inﬂuence its excitation
condition. Again g was considered as a radial vector such that ∇u2 = g u2.

Let us ﬁrst give equation (2) governing B inside the cylinder and the supplementing relations in a

non–dimensional form. In that sense we put

Ω = Ω0 ˜Ω , U z = U0 ˜Uz ,

u2 = u2

0χ .

(22)

Here Ω0 and U0 are constants describing typical values of Ω and U z, e.g., being their values at r = 0, and
˜Ω and ˜U z are dimensionless functions of r. Further u0 means the value of u at r = 0, and χ is again a
dimensionless function of r. In the following we measure all lengths in units of the radius R of the cylinder
and the time in units of R2/η. Then (2) can be written in the form

∂tB − ∇ × (RU ˜U × B + R2

u0 ( ˜F(B) + ξRU ˜G(B) )) − ∇2B = 0 , ∇ · B = 0

The ˆr, ˆϕ and ˆz are unit vectors in r, ϕ and z direction, and primes indicate diﬀerentiations with respect
to the dimensionless radial co–ordinate r. Note that the ˜γ(0), ˜β(0), ˜α(Ω)
, · · · ˜κ(D) depend on q, most of
them also on P m. As for the components of (∇B)(s) in the cylindrical co–ordinate system we refer to the
Appendix. Of course, equation (23) has to be completed by boundary conditions.

We will look for solutions of the above equations for B having the form

with a positive integer m, a real non–zero wavenumber k and a complex growth rate λ. Note that by
Cowling’s theorem solutions with m = 0 have to be excluded as long as Ru0 = 0.

a piston proﬁle. The outcomes of the water experiments made to simulate the ﬂow in the dynamo device
ﬁt best to ρ = 18. In view of χ, which is deﬁned by (22), we adopt a relation for the r.m.s. value u of the
turbulent velocity given by Schlichting (1964),

On this basis χ has been calculated with ν such that P m = 10−5. Proﬁles of ˜Ω and ˜Uz and of χ and χ′
for several ρ are depicted in ﬁgure 1.

in the absence of turbulence, that is, Ru0 = 0

cross–section of the cylinder is equal to zero. Therefore it is to be required that B inside the cylinder
continues as a single-valued potential ﬁeld in outer space. In the second case it is assumed that the ﬂuid
cylinder is muﬄed by a rigid electrically conducting shell, in the experimental device made of copper, and
there is free space outside this shell. Again B has to continue as a single–valued potential ﬁeld in this free
space. The thickness of the shell, measured in units of R, is denoted by d, and the ratio of the electrical
conductivity of the shell to that of the ﬂuid by s. The ﬁrst case may be considered as the special case
d = 0 of the second one. The experimental device corresponds to d = 0.15 and s = 5.

The equations (23)–(27) together with the ansatz (29) have been reduced to a system of ordinary
diﬀerential equation which, together with the boundary conditions, deﬁnes an eigenvalue problem with
the growth rate λ as eigenvalue parameter. After discretization of the equations this problem has been
solved with the QR algorithm. In the following we restrict our attention to solutions with ℜ(λ) = 0. The
corresponding values of RU are denoted as critical values.

5.3 Inﬂuences of the turbulence on the excitation threshold

Let us ﬁrst give critical values of RU for the ideal situation without turbulence, that is, Ru0 = 0. For any
given ζ and ρ they still depend on m and k. We restrict ourselves to m = 1. All solutions of the equations
considered with the same parameters but other m have higher critical values of RU . We denote the minimal
critical RU for given ζ and ρ but varying k by R∗
U and
k∗ as functions of ζ for several cases concerning d and ρ. It shows in particular that a highly conducting
shell around the ﬂuid cylinder markedly favors the screw dynamo; (see also Avalos-Zuniga et al. 2003,
Avalos-Zuniga and Plunian 2005).

U and the corresponding k by k∗. Figure 2 shows R∗

We admit now turbulence. Since in the experiment ζ will probably be close to unity we put now through-
out ζ = 1. As ﬁgure 3 demonstrates the turbulence generally enlarges the dynamo threshold. Consider
the most realistic case d = 0.15, s = 0.5 and ρ = 18. Assuming that Ru0 is of the order of 10−1 and ξ of
the order 10−2 we conclude that R∗
U grows by at most 0.5 percent. We point out, however, that all our
calculations have been done with Pm = 10−5 and q = 0.02. The data of table 1 suggest that the inﬂuence
of the turbulence will be markedly larger if larger values of q have to be assumed.

Several investigations have been made in order to ﬁnd out which speciﬁc induction eﬀects of the turbu-
lence such as α–eﬀects, γ–eﬀects etc. hamper the screw dynamo or possibly support it. In that sense only
parts of the mean electromotive force E have been taken into account. Both cases with ρ = 1 and more
realistic ones with ρ = 18 have been studied. In the latter one parts of the proﬁles of ˜Ω, ˜Uz and χ are
markedly steeper.

Let us consider ﬁrst the α–eﬀects. Note that the α(Ω)

–eﬀects are absent since g is orthogonal
to both Ω and W. The inﬂuence of the α(Ω)
and α(D)–eﬀects on the screw dynamo depends crucially
on ρ. In cases with ρ = 1 it was found that they act against the screw dynamo. Figure 4a shows results
for a more realistic case with ρ = 18, in which these eﬀects clearly support the screw dynamo.

taken into account, with ζ = 1, d = 0.15, s = 5, ρ = 18 and diﬀerent ξ (indicated by diﬀerent line styles as in ﬁgure 3)

Consider next the γ–eﬀects. In all investigated cases, both with ρ = 1 and also with higher ρ, they

hamper the screw dynamo. Figure 4b illustrates this for the above case with ρ = 18.

Proceeding now to the β–eﬀects we note ﬁrst that the β(0)–eﬀect may be interpreted in the sense of
the mean–ﬁeld magnetic diﬀusivity η + β(0) diﬀerent from the molecular diﬀusivity η. Since β(0) is always
positive it raises the threshold of the screw dynamo. The β(D)–eﬀect makes the mean-ﬁeld magnetic
diﬀusivity anisotropic. It is then described by the tensor (η + β(0)) δij + β(D)Dij. In all investigated cases,
with ρ = 1 and also with higher ρ, the β(D)–eﬀect for not too small ξ always dominates the β(0)–eﬀect
and clearly supports the screw dynamo. This implies of course that the mentioned tensor is not positive
deﬁnite; otherwise it had to act against the screw dynamo. Results for the above case with ρ = 18 are
shown in ﬁgure 5a.

Both the δ(Ω) and δ(W )–eﬀects and also the κ(Ω)–eﬀect always support the screw dynamo. The κ(W ) and
κ(D)–eﬀects and also all κ–eﬀects together act against it. This is partially reﬂected in ﬁgures 5b and 6a
applying again to the above case with ρ = 18.

We recall here that δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–eﬀects together with a suﬃciently strong rotational shear open the
possibility of a mean–ﬁeld dynamo diﬀerent from the screw dynamo, often called Ω × J dynamo (R¨adler
1969, 1980, 1986, Roberts 1972, Moﬀatt and Proctor 1982). The positive inﬂuence of the δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–
eﬀects on the screw dynamo, demonstrated by ﬁgure 6b, can possibly be interpreted in the sense of this
dynamo mechanism.

In contrast to the combination of the δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–eﬀects that of the δ(W ) and κ(W )–eﬀects, as ﬁgure 7a
shows, does not support the screw dynamo. For the W × J dynamo, which has recently been proposed
(Rogachevskii and Kleeorin 2003), the δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and κ(D)–eﬀects are important. However, it turned
out that at least the simple model in plane geometry, which was used to explain this proposal, fails to
work as a dynamo as long as δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and κ(D) are determined in the second–order correlation

approximation (R¨adler and Stepanov 2005, R¨udiger and Kitchatinov 2006). In this context it is of interest
that the combination of the δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and κ(D)–eﬀects, as ﬁgure 7b shows, does not support the
screw dynamo. This is also in so far quite remarkable as we already know that the β(D)–eﬀect supports it.
It is the κ(W ) and κ(D)–eﬀects which have a strong opposite inﬂuence.

Our results show that the total inﬂuence of the induction eﬀects of the turbulence on the threshold of
the screw dynamo, which we have estimated above, is weaker than the inﬂuences of some of the individual
eﬀects. Obviously a part of them compensates each other.

6 Summary

The electromagnetic processes in Perm dynamo experiment are inﬂuenced by turbulent motions accompa-
nying the main ﬂow. Their inﬂuence on the dynamo process has been investigated within the framework
of mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics. The critical magnetic Reynolds number R∗
U of the main ﬂow, which deﬁnes
the onset of the screw dynamo, grows with the magnetic Reynolds number Ru0 of the turbulence and
the also with the parameter q, that is, the ratio of the decay time of a magnetic ﬁeld extended over one
correlation length to the correlation time. Under the assumptions on these quantities made above, which
we consider as realistic, R∗
U changes hardly by more than 0.5 percent. If they are by any reason larger, R∗
becomes larger, too.

U

The electromagnetic eﬀects of the turbulence are analyzed in terms of α, γ, β, δ and κ–eﬀects. Despite
helical structures in the turbulence there is no complete α–eﬀect. The mean electromotive force due to this
α–eﬀect has not always a component in the direction of the mean magnetic ﬁeld. This fact explains the
measurements made at an experimental setup simulating the dynamo device in a smaller scale. Despite
this peculiarity the α–eﬀect supports the screw dynamo slightly. The γ–eﬀect acts always against the
screw dynamo. The two contributions to the β–eﬀect, the β(0) and the β(D)–eﬀect, act in opposite ways.
The β(0)–eﬀect leads to an mean-ﬁeld diﬀusivity larger than the molecular one and so raises the screw
dynamo threshold. The β(D)–eﬀect makes the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity anisotropic and strongly supports the
screw dynamo. Likewise the δ–eﬀects support the screw dynamo whereas the κ–eﬀects act against it. It
is known that the δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–eﬀects in combination with a proper, suﬃciently strong rotational shear
may work as a dynamo, sometimes called Ω × J dynamo. They also support the screw dynamo. Analogous
to the Ω × J dynamo the possibility of a W × J dynamo has been discussed in the literature, for which
the δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and κ(D)–eﬀects are important, but the question of its existence remained open so
far. Interestingly enough it was found that the combination of these eﬀects does not support the screw
dynamo.

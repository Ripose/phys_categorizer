We show that some impassioned van Gogh paintings display scaling properties similar to the
observed in turbulent ﬂuids, suggesting that these paintings reﬂect the ﬁngerprint of turbulence with
such a realism that is even consistent with the way that a mathematical model characterizes this
phenomenon. Speciﬁcally, we show that the probability distribution function (PDF) of luminance
ﬂuctuations of points (pixels) separated by a distance R is consistent with the Kolmogorov scaling
theory in turbulent ﬂuids. We also show that the most turbulent paintings of van Gogh coincide
with periods of prolonged psychotic agitation of this artist.

Everything in the last period of Vincent van Gogh paintings seems to be moving; this dynamical style served to
transmit his own feelings about a ﬁgure or a landscape. It has been speciﬁcally mentioned that the famous painting
Starry Night, vividly transmits the sense of turbulence and was compared with a picture of a distant star from the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, where eddies probably caused by dust and gas turbulence are clearly seen [1]. It
is the purpose of this paper to show that some impassioned van Gogh paintings, painted during periods of prolonged
psychotic agitation of this artist, reﬂect the ﬁngerprint of turbulence with such a realism that is even consistent with
the Kolmogorov scaling theory in turbulent ﬂuids. Speciﬁcally, we show that the probability distribution function
(PDF) of luminance ﬂuctuations (δu) of points (pixels) separated by a distance R in Starry Night, and some other van
Gogh paintings, is the same as the PDF of the velocity diﬀerences (δv) of pairs of points separated by a distance (R)
in a turbulent ﬂow as predicted by the statistical theory of Kolmogorov. This is not the ﬁrst time that this scaling
behavior is observed in a ﬁeld far diﬀerent from ﬂuid mechanics; Kolmogorov scaling was also observed in ﬂuctuations
of the foreign exchange markets time series [2].

We mainly study van Gogh’s Starry Night (June 1889), which undoubtedly transmits the feeling of turbulence.
Also, as samples of another turbulent pictures, we analyze Road with Cypress and Star (May 1890) and Wheat Field
with Crows (July 1890, just before van Gogh shot himself). By considering the analogy with the Kolmogorov scaling
theory, from our results we can conclude that Vincent van Gogh was capable of capturing the ﬁngerprint of turbulence.
Our results also reinforce the idea that scientiﬁc objectivity may help to determine the fundamental content of artistic
paintings, as was already done with Jackson Pollock’s fractal paintings [3, 4]. Along this same ideas, it also worthy
to mention that another notable ability of van Gogh was recently remarked with an experiment with bumblebees
that had never seen natural ﬂowers; insects were more attracted by van Gogh’s Sunﬂowers than by other paintings
containing ﬂowers [5]. From this observation, Chittka and Walker suggest that van Gogh’s ﬂower paintings have
captured the essence of ﬂoral features from a bee’s point of view.

The statistical model of Kolmogorov [6, 7] is a foundation for modern turbulence theory. The main idea is that at
very large Reynolds numbers, between the large scale of energy input (L) and the dissipation scale (η), at which viscous
frictions become dominant, there is a myriad of small scales where turbulence displays universal properties independent
of initial and boundary conditions. In particular, in the inertial range Kolmogorov predicts a famous scaling property
2
of the second order structure function, S2(R) = h(δv)
i is the velocity increment

i, where δv = h(v(r + R) − v(r))

between two points separated by a distance R and v is the component of the velocity in the direction of R. In his
ﬁrst 1941 paper [6] Kolmogorov postulates two hypotheses of similarity that led to the prediction that S2(R) scales
, where R = kRk and ε is the mean energy dissipation rate per unit mass. Under the same assumptions,
as (εR)
in his third 1941 turbulence paper [7] Kolmogorov found an exact expression for the third moment, h(δv)
i, which is
given by S3(R) = − 4
5 εR. Furthermore, it has been claimed that this scaling results generalizes to structure functions
i)1/2 is then scale
of any order, i.e. Sn(R) = h(δv)ni ∝ Rξn , where ξn = n/3. The PDF PR(δv)) = δv(R)/(h(δv(R))
invariant. Experimental measurements show that Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the truth in the sense that
statistical quantities depend on the length scale R as a power law. The intermittent nature of turbulence causes,
however, that the numerical values of ξn deviate progressively from n/3 when n increases, following a concave curve
below the n/3 line [8].

Starry Night, painted during his one year period in the Saint Paul de Mausole Asylum at Saint-R´emy-de-Provence,
is undoubtedly van Gogh’s most mysterious masterpiece (Fig. 1). With the scene of a spectacularly transﬁgured sky,
van Gogh immortalized his experience during a twilight state [9]. To perform the turbulence analysis of Starry Night,
we start from a digitized, 300dpi, 2750 × 3542 image obtained from The Museum of Modern Art in New York (where
the original paint lies), provided by Art Resource, Inc. We use the luminance (overall intensity) of the image since the
eye is more sensitive to luminance changes than to color changes and usually most of the information about a scene is
contained in its luminance. In a digital image, the luminance of a pixel is obtained from its RBG (red, green and blue)
components as [10] 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B. This approximate formula takes into account the fact that the human
eye is more sensitive to green, then red and lastly blue. Thus, we use the PDF of pixel luminance ﬂuctuations by
building up a matrix whose rows contain diﬀerence in luminance δu and columns contain separation between pixels R.
From this matrix, we determine the probability density of luminances PR(δu) with six pixel separations, R = 60, 240,
400, 600, 800, 1200, shown in Fig. 2. In order to rule out scaling artifacts, we have systematically recalculate the PDF
function to images with lower resolutions (with an adequate rescaling of the pixel separations R). No signiﬁcative
diﬀerences appear up to images with resolutions lower that 150 × 127 pixels, where the details of the brushwork are
lost.

By taking the analogy with Kolmogorov turbulence further, we take the large length scale as L = 2000 pixels,
which is size of the largest eddy observed in the Starry Night. The cascade mechanism can be then corroborated if
the statistical moments scale as h(δu(R))ni ∝ Rξn. In Fig. 3a, we show a log-log plot of the statistical moments with
n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (from bottom to top), which shows power-law scalings of the statistical moments with respect to the
scale R. In each case straight line indicates the least-squares ﬁt to the range of scales limited by the two dashed lines
in the plot. In Fig. 3b, the scaling exponent ξn, of the ﬁrst nine statistical moments are shown as a function of n.
Data points are ﬁtted to a straight line with slope 0.69 ± 0.0114 (with a 95% conﬁdence bounds).

In turbulence, a functional form of the PDF at diﬀerent scales has been parameterized with a Gaussian ansatz,
using a model motivated by the cascade energy [11]. By superimposing several Gaussians at diﬀerent scales, it is
inferred that the shape of the PDF goes from nearly Gaussian at large scales R to nearly exponential at small scales.
The number of superimposed Gaussians is controlled by a parameter, λ, which is the only parameter that must be
ﬁtted to the data. A large value of λ means that many scales contribute to the results, and thus the PDF develops
tails that decay much slower than a pure Gaussian correlation. Curves of data points in Fig. 2 were ﬁtted according
to this model, yielding a notably good ﬁt. Results are shown in the same ﬁgure with full lines; parameter values are
λ = 0.2, 0.15, 0.12, 0.11, 0.09, 0.0009 (from bottom to top).

Kolmogorov’s hypotheses of turbulence implies that the parameter λ2 decreases linearly with ln(R). This also
veriﬁes indirectly the power-law scaling of the statistical moments and the validity of the cascade mechanism in
Kolmogorov’s turbulence picture. Figure 3(c) shows the dependence of λ2 on R, the straight line indicates the least
squares ﬁt.

From van Gogh’s 1890 period, we analyze two paintings: Road with Cypress and Star and Wheat Field with Crows.
The former was painted just after the last and most prolonged psychotic episode of van Gogh’s life, lasting from
February to April 1890, during which the artist suﬀered terrifying hallucinations and severe agitation [9]. The later
was painted just before the artist shot himself. Fig. 4 shows the PDF of Road with Cypress and Star and Fig. 5
shows the PDF of Wheat Field with Crows. In both cases the curves show the behaviour predicted by Kolmogorov’s
turbulence theory.

For comparison purposes, in Fig. 6 we show van Gogh’s Self-portrait with pipe and bandaged ear and its PDF. In
a well known episode of his life, on 23 December 1888, Vincent van Gogh mutilated the lower portion of his left ear.
He was hospitalized at the Hˆotel-Dieu hospital in Arles and prescribed potassium bromide [9]. After some weeks,
van Gogh recovered from the psychotic state and, in a stage of absolute calm (as himself described in a letter to his
brother Theo and sister Wilhemina [12]), he painted the self-portrait with pipe. As it can be seen in Fig. 6, the PDF

of this paint departs from what is expected in Kolmogorov’s model of turbulence

In summary, our results show that Starry Night, and other impassioned van Gogh paintings, painted during periods
of prolonged psychotic agitation captured the essence of turbulence. We use Kolmogorov’s model of turbulence to
determine the degree of ”realism” contained in the turbulent clouds of Starry Night. We are also suggesting new tools
and approaches that open the possibility of quantitative objective research for art representation.

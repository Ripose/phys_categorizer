Abstract

We introduce a generalization of Obukhov’s model [A.M. Obukhov, Adv. Geophys. 6, 113

(1959)] for the description of the joint position-velocity statistics of a single ﬂuid particle in fully

developed turbulence. In the presented model the velocity is assumed to undergo a continuous

time random walk. This takes into account long time correlations. As a consequence the evolution

equation for the joint position-velocity probability distribution is a Fokker-Planck equation with

a fractional time derivative. We determine the solution of this equation in the form of an integral

transform and derive a relation for arbitrary single time moments. Analytical solutions for the

joint probability distribution and its moments are given.

INTRODUCTION

The statistics of turbulent ﬂows is described by phenomenological theories dating back

to Kolmogorov and Obukhov [1],[2],[3]. In a Lagrangian treatment the path X(t, y) and the

velocity U(t, y) of advected particles initially starting at the position y are determined by

the acceleration A(t, y) which in principle is given by the Navier-Stokes equation:

dX(t, y)
dt
dU(t, y)
dt

= U(t, y)

= A(t, y)

,

.

The central statistical quantity is the joint position-velocity probability distribution of the

particle:

f (u, x, t) = < δ(x

normal scaling behaviour (3) usually serves as a ﬁrst starting point.

Due to the fact that a successfull statistical approach based on a treatment of the Navier-

Stokes equation is still missing, one has to resort to heuristic assumptions about the statistics

of A(t, y). An early model for f (u, x, t) has been introduced by Obukhov [4], who assumed,

that the turbulent acceleration A(t, y) is a Gaussian, δ-correlated random force:

< Ai(t, y)Aj(t′, y) > = 2δijδ(t

In turn the probability distribution (2) obeys a Fokker-Planck equation:

which is consistent with the phenomenological scaling theory of Kolmogorov (K41). However

Obukhov’s model contradicts recent experimental results [5], [6]: the probability distribution

for the velocity increment is far from Gaussian and the increment behaviour can not be a

simple random walk as suggested by Obukhov. The reason is the intermittent character of

turbulent ﬂows. Nonnormal statistics for Lagrangian variables may originate from long time

correlations in the turbulent ﬁeld. During the last few years lots of eﬀorts have been put

into the formulation of more sophisticated phenomenological theories which can take into

account these facts (c.f. the review article [7]). Recently a connection between the velocity

increment statistics of a Lagrangian particle and a type of continuous time random walk has

been introduced [8] by a truncation of an inﬁnite chain of evolution equations for multiple

particle probability distributions. The following evolution equation for the single time joint

position velocity increment probability distribution has been obtained

In the case of isotropic turbulent ﬂows, the ma-

trix Qij(u2) has to be invariant with respect to rotations leading to the form given above.

Furthermore, the variables Q1 and Q2 are constant due to the fact that solutions of the

above equation are required to allow for scaling behaviour of the velocity increment u

(for constant value of α). The parameter α is taken from the interval 0 < α

equation generalizes Obukhov’s model in several respects. First, it introduces a temporal

memory. Second, the simple diﬀusion process in velocity space is changed to a diﬀusion

process with velocity dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Third, retardation eﬀects with respect

to the spatial coordinate appear. It has been shown that solutions of the resulting equation

for the velocity pdf G(u, t) =

dxf (u, x, t) yields excellent approximations to the experi-

mentally determined velocity pdf’s, provided the parameter α is allowed to vary with the

R

time increment. A complete solution to the equation (7) has not yet been obtained.

In the present paper we investigate a simpler phenomenological model by disregarding

the retardation in the spatial coordinate:

The purpose of the present paper is not to state the accurate evolution equation for

the Lagrangian position-velocity increment. This task has to be performed on the basis

of a theoretical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation, as has been started in [8], or by

sophisticated data analysis of the experimentally obtained Lagrangian path’s of particles. An

assessment of the underlying stochastic process, in our opinion, has to include the description

of multiple time distributions. Such an analysis for a class of continuous time random walks

has recently been started [9]. The purpose of the present paper is to consider an extension

of Obukhov’s model to a class of fractional diﬀusion equations, whose study quite seemingly

is interesting by its own. It is hoped that the obtained results contribute to a more detailed

understanding of Lagrangian turbulence statistics.

The paper is outlined as follows. In the next section we focus on the probability distribu-

tion for the velocity increment and review how it can be determined by methods developed

in the theory of continuous time random walks (for a recent review of the topic we refer the

reader to [10], [11]). In section III we shall show that the joint position velocity pdf can be

expressed as an integral transform

is characterized by subdiﬀusive behaviour related to temporal memory eﬀects. It is shown

Special emphasis is put onto the case of L(u,

that both velocity and position of the particle reveal anomalous diﬀusive properties. We

explicitly determine the probability distributions of velocity and spatial coordinate. For

These two equations determine hα(s, t) in the form eq.(13). The properties of the diﬀusion
∇u) enter via the pdf G1(u, t). The form of the pdf, eq. (12) has the following
interpretation. There is a usual diﬀusion process w(s) described by a Fokker-Planck operator
∇w) with respect to an intrinsic time s. Additionally, there is a prozess s = s(t) relating
physical time t and intrinsic time s with a probability distribution hα(s, t). The random

L(w,

process u(t) is given by u(t) = w(s(t)).

III. SOLUTION OF THE GENERALIZED OBUKHOV-MODEL

Motivated by the results for the fractional diﬀusion equation we look for solutions of

eq.(8) which can be expressed as an integral transform similar to eq.(12):

The structure of the pdf, eq. (15), has the following interpretation. Let us consider the case
L = ∆u. There is a stochastic process with respect to the intrinsic time s given by

dz

.

dx(t)

= u(t)

.

Furthermore, there is a process s(t) relating physical time t and intrinsic time s. The velocity

u(t), thereby, is given by u(t) = w(s(t)). If the space variable x(t) would be obtained via

x(t) = z(s(t)) the function h would not depend on x and z and would be simply given by

the function hα(s, t) of the preceding section. However, the space variable x(t) is deﬁned by

the relationship

the velocity u.

This explains the fact why h(z, x; s, t) depends on the two spatial variables x, z but not on

In the following we shall derive a fractional diﬀerential equation for h(z, x; s, t), corre-

sponding boundary conditions and obtain an explicit solution. We proceed as follows: the
∇u) only

ansatz eq.(15) is substituted into the evolution equation (8). The operator L(u,

acts on f1(u, z, s) such that eq.(16) can be applied:

In the integral on the right hand side we perform a partial integration with respect to z

This is the generalization of eq. (14).

We have to add the following remarks. First, equation (23) determines the u-independent

function h(z, x; s, t) by a relation including the velocity u. The fact that there is no u-

dependence has been crucial for arriving at the equations (23). Below, we shall show that we

actually can ﬁnd a u-independent solution. Second, we point out that the properties of the
∇u) do not show up in the determination of the function h(z, x; s, t).
The properties of this operator are included in the pdf f (u, z, s) and we have obtained the

solution in terms of an integral transform for a large class of stochastic processes.

A. Determination of h(z, x; s, t)

The solution of diﬀerential equations containing the Riemann-Liouville fractional diﬀer-

ential operator is simpliﬁed by changing to Laplace-space. This is due to the fact that the

integral in the deﬁnition eq.(9) is actually a Laplace-convolution. Throughout this discus-

Linear partial diﬀerential equations of this type can be solved by the method of charac-

teristics (see e.g. [16]). This method will be applied below.

If we choose s as parameter of the characteristics, eq.(25) can be written as

(28)

For the initial condition ˜h(z(0), x(0); 0, λ) = ˜h(z0, x0; 0, λ) we specify a sharp distribution
at x0. The dependence on λ is chosen as λα−1 to be consistent with the boundary condition
(23). If we put z0 = 0 the inital condition takes the form:

˜h(z0 = 0, x0; 0, λ) = δ(x0)λα−1 = δ(x

λα−1z)λα−1

Finally we obtain the kernel of the transformation eq.(15) as solution of the partial diﬀer-

Thus statistical quantities can be calculated in Laplace-space and then transformed to

˜h(z, x; s, λ) the solution of the generalized Obukhov-model can be completely characterized.

However, several remarks are in order. First of all, one can easily check that the solutions

Z

f1(u, z, s), and,

in turn, f (u, x, t). This proofs that the generalized Oboukhov model

actually deﬁnes a probability distribution for the case 0 < α < 1.

Second, we have to show that the above assumptions are fullﬁlled. To this end we note

that the quantity h(z, x; s, t) in fact is independent on the velocity u. Furthermore, we have

the relationship

which in real space reads

˜h(0, x; s, λ) = δ(x)˜hα(s, λ)

The case α = 1 has to lead to the ordinary Obukhov model. Evidently the integral kernel

The right hand side of this equation is the Laplace-transform of the solution eq.(12) of the

B. The joint probability distribution f (u, x, t)

In the following we derive a formal expression for the joint probability distribution
˜h(z, x; s, λ). First the Laplace-transform of f (u, x, t) is calculated using the transforma-

Formula (48) yields an interesting structure. First of all, it represents a probability dis-

tribution as a superposition of pdf’s G1(x, s) with diﬀerent variances. Such a representation

has been introduced by Castain et al. [12] in a description of the intermittent behaviour of

the Eulerian velocity increment pdf. Second, scaling behaviour < u2(t) >

related to a random walk behaviour in velocity space. However, the formula (48) shows that

such scaling behaviour may also arise for the cases [8] where the scaling indices α, δ are

related by

These solutions have been shown to yield accurate reconstructions of the velocity increment

pdf for turbulent ﬂows measured in [5] by adjusting the parameter α [8]. For the case of

turbulent ﬂows, the determination of the parameter α and especially its time dependence is

an open problem.

D. The probability distribution F (x, t)

Let us now turn to the probability distribution F (x, t) for the position x. This distribution

is obtained from the joint pdf f (u, x, t) by integration with respect to the velocity variable:

F (x, t) =

duf (u, x, t)

One observes that the limiting case α = 1 leads to pdf of the Obukhov model. Furthermore, it

is evident that the probability distribution of the spatial variable x is given by an expression

similar to the one obtained for the velocity variable in form of an integral transform:

F (x, t) =

This expression has to be compared with the one obtained for the pdf of the velocity (50).

We mention that the solution (58) can be related to a continuous time random walk

for the position increment x(t) of a Lagrangian particle. Continuous time random walks

for the description of the distance between two Lagrangian variables in connection with

Richardson’s law have been discussed by Shlesinger et al. [17].

E. Moments of the generalized Obukhov-model

Starting from eq.(40) we can derive a general relation for moments of arbitrary order of

the joint probability distribution f (u, x, t).

Single-time moments < xn

i (t)um

i (t) > are deﬁned as follows:

In the last step the integration over the δ-function has been performed. Here we recognize

that simply the moments of the ordinary Obukhov-model appear:

i f1(u, z, s) =
i (s) >. As as consequence the inverse Laplace-transform leads to a general expres-

integration of single-time moments of the inverse L´evy-stable process [9]. These calculations

can always be performed in an elementary manner.

For example, by applying eq.(65) to the second order moments for the case of L = ∆u

we obtain:

Clearly, in each case the limit α

1 of the Obukhov-model is satisﬁed. Therefore the

generalized Obukhov-model eq.(8) with L = ∆u is characterized by subdiﬀusive behaviour

of the particle velocity corresponding to the fractional diﬀusion equation (11) and mean

square displacement < x2(t) >

tα+2 of the particle position.

IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

We have introduced a non-Markovian model for the joint position-velocity probability

distribution of a random walk particle as a generalization of Obukhov’s model. Long-time

correlations of the particle velocity are taken into account by fractional time derivatives.

As in the limit case of the fractional diﬀusion equation, a solution can be found as an

integral transformation of the Markovian solution. The integral kernel has been obtained

by solving a fractional diﬀerential equation and yields a complete characterization of the

single time statistical properties. As ﬁnal results we have given analytical expressions for

the joint probability distribution and its moments. The generalized Obukhov-model may

thus serve as an appropriate model for random walk processes revealing anomalous diﬀusion

in velocity- and position-space.

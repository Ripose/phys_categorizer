Probability Densities in Strong Turbulence.

Abstract

According to modern developments in turbulence theory, the ”dissipation” scales (u.v.

cut-oﬀs) η form a random ﬁeld related to velocity increments δηu. In this work we,

using Mellin’s transform combined with the Gaussain large -scale boundary condition,

calculate probability densities (PDFs) of velocity increments P (δru, r) and the PDF of

the dissipation scales Q(η, Re), where Re is the large-scale Reynolds number. The re-

sulting expressions strongly deviate from the Log-normal PDF PL(δru, r) often quoted

in the literature. It is shown that the probability density of the small-scale velocity

ﬂuctuations includes information about the large (integral) scale dynamics which is

responsible for deviation of P (δru, r) from PL(δru, r). A framework for evaluation of

the PDFs of various turbulence characteristics involving spatial derivatives is devel-

oped. The exact relation, free of spurious Logarithms recently discussed in Frisch et

al (J. Fluid Mech. 542, 97 (2005)), for the multifractal probability density of velocity

increments, not based on the steepest descent evaluation of the integrals is obtained

and the calculated function D(h) is close to experimental data. A novel derivation

(Polyakov, 2005), of a well-known result of the multi-fractal theory [Frisch, ”Turbu-

lence. Legacy of A.N.Kolmogorov”, Cambridge University Press, 1995)) , based on the

concepts described in this paper, is also presented.

1 Introduction.

A reasonably well experimentally established anomalous (multi) scaling of the structure

functions Sn,m = (u(x + r)

v(x))n

(δru)m(δrv)m , where u and v are

respectively, is one of the properties of strong turbulence which makes it ”the last unsolved

problem of continuum mechanics”. [1]-[4]. The anomalous dimension, a property of strongly

interacting systems ﬁrst introduced to the quantum ﬁeld theory by Gribov and Migdal [5] and

Polyakov [6], is a notoriously diﬃcult from theoretical viewpoint concept and only recently,

after many years of trying, the theory of anomalous scaling of the structure functions of a

passive scalar advected by a white-in-time random velocity ﬁeld, has been developed [7]-[8].

Almost simultaneously, the theory of bi-scaling in turbulence generated by the forced Burgers

equation [9]-[10] was formulated. The attempts to explain anomalous dimensions in three

dimensional turbulence were made in Refs.[11]-[12]. It was shown that the Navier-Stokes

equations combined with a simple model for the pressure -velocity correlations , lead to

homogeneous diﬀerential equations for the structure functions and, as a result, to anomalous

scaling exponents which cannot be obtained on dimensional grounds.

During last forty-ﬁfty years, a substantial eﬀort was devoted to derivation or at least modeling

of various probability densities in turbulence. The ﬁrst attempts resulting in the Log-normal

PDF of the dissipation rate ﬂuctuations, consistent with the multi-scaling, were made by

Kolmogorov [13] and Yaglom [14], using a simple cascade model. This result was later

criticized by Orszag [15] as, in general, not realizable. Similar Log-normal PDF was obtained

for the not too large magnitudes of velocity increment δru = u(x + r)

u(x) in Ref. [11] ,

−

which was later experimentally tested by Kurien and Sreenivasan [3]. Some other attempts

based on analysis of experimental data led to various ﬁts ranging from Log-normal and Log-

Poison expressions to exponential and ”stretched exponential ” PDFs P (δru). In this paper

we, addressing this problem, will restrict ourselves by considerations based on equations of

motion.

This paper is organized in a following way. In the Section 2 we introduce the Mellin trans-

2

form for the probability density of velocity increments and deﬁne the large- scale Gaussian

boundary condition. We show that the ”normal (linear ) scaling” corresponds to the Gaussa-

ian PDF of the small-scale ﬂuctuations. The PDF accounting for small deviations from the

linear scaling is calculated and compared with traditional Log-normal expressions. In Section

3, we based on theoretical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations and numerical simulations

by Gotoh and Nakano [16], justify the boundary conditions used for the derivation of Sec 2.

The random ﬁeld of the dissipation scales η (linear dimensions of the dissipative structures) ,

derived from the expression for the dissipation anomaly, is introduced in Sec 4 and the PDF

Q(η, Re) is computed in Section 5. Discussions and conclusions are presented in Section

6. There, the exact expression for the probability density of velocity increments following

the multifractal formalism is presented and one of the results of the multi-fractal theory is

derived (Polyakov 2005) without the multifractal input. Some of the concepts and relations

presented below have been reported in the previous publications [12], [17]-[18]. Wherever

needed, we repeat them here for the sake of continuity and clarity.

2 The Mellin transform.

If the moments of velocity increments δru are given by the scaling relations Sn,0 = (δru)n =

A(n)rξn, then probability density function can be found from the Mellin transform:

P (δru, r) =

A(n)rξ(n)(δru)−

where we set the integral scale L and the dissipation rate

equal to unity. Multiplying (1)

by (δru)k and evaluating a simple integral, gives Sk,0 = A(k)rξk.

E

To make use of the relation (1) the dynamic information about both the amplitudes A(n)

and the exponents ξn is needed.

In order to obtain an expression for A(n) from a large

scale boundary condition on the PDF, we ﬁrst have to deﬁne the integral scale L. Based on

experimental data and theoretical consideration (see below), we choose L as a scale at which

the energy ﬂux toward small scales changes sign or tends to zero. This means that at the

3

small scales r < L the structure function S3(r) < 0 and at the larger scales r > L, S3 ≥
Typically, at this scale which depends upon the geometric details of the ﬂow, the odd-order

0.

moments S2n+1(L) = 0 and the even-order ones saturate: ∂rS2n,0(L) = 0. This property

of turbulence has recently been examined both numerically and experimentally [19]-[20] (a

theoretical argument will be given below). The scale L appears naturally in a simple case

of the Navier-Stokes equations on an inﬁnite domain driven by the white-in-time forcing

function with the variance:

f 2(k) = P

where

structure function S3(r) gives an oscillating expression

extremely close to the Gaussian. We would like to stress that the integral scale deﬁned

this way is not the largest scale (size) a system but rather corresponds to the top of the

inertial range where the constant energy ﬂux toward small scales sets up. The Gaussian

boundary condition at r = 1 leads to a plausible and well- tested (both experimentally and

numerically), expression A(n) = (2n

1)!! which will be used in all calculations of this paper.

−

In what follows a dynamic and numerical justiﬁcation for this result will be presented.

First we consider the case of ”normal scaling ” ξ = an. Writing (2n

(3)

which for not too large moment numbers n can perceived as ﬁrst two terms of the Taylor

expansion of ξn in the vicinity of n = 0. The formula (3) is a generic perturbative expression

for the exponents ξn independent upon the nature of the problem and the relations similar

to (3) have resulted from the recent perturbative theories of a passive scalar in a random

velocity ﬁeld. [7]-[8]. Using the Kolmogorov constraint ξ3 = 1, gives: b = (3a

1)/9. It is

−

clear that the expression (3) cannot be correct for all values of the moment order n. Indeed,

in accord with Holder’s inequality, ξn, is a concave and non-decreasing function of n or in

is a sign of intermittency and anomalous scaling.

Both PDFs (5) and (6) are normalized to two. The expression (6) , which has also been

derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations combined with a simple model for the

pressure -velocity correlation function in Ref.

[11], has been experimentally veriﬁed by

Kurien and Sreenivasan [3]. The comparison between (5) and (6) showing a surprisingly large

diﬀerence between the approximately and numerically calculated integral (5) is presented on

Fig. 2.

In addition, it follows from Figs. 1 and 2 that while P (δru, r) has a maximum

at δru = 0, in the limit δru

0, the Log-normal PDF PL, given by (6) rapidly decreases

→

to zero, meaning that it may be a reasonable approximation not too close to the origin at

δru = 0.

In the most interesting case ξ(n) = an

1+bn , the integral (1) with A(n) = (2n

evaluated both exactly and by the steepest descent method leading at the large magnitudes

of the argument u/ra to the algebraically decreasing probability density consistent with the
saturation of the exponents ξn →

3 The relations between moments. Simulations by Go-

toh and Nakano (Ref. [16].)

In this Section we would like to develop some dynamic arguments justifying the choice of

the structure functions amplitudes A2n,0 = (2n

1)!! used in the above calculations. The

−

relations for the moments of velocity diﬀerence Sn,m were derived in Refs. [11], [12] and later

in [22] using an alternative approach. In particular, the equation for the even-order moments

is:

This relation is not closed. In the vicinity of the integral scale where the odd-order moments

S2n+1(L) and derivatives of the even order moments ∂rS2n,0(L) disappear, the pressure gra-

dient terms can be neglected. Here we would like to present a possible physical explanation

of this eﬀect. If geometry of the large- scale unstable structures leading to the energy cas-

cade toward small scales is deﬁned by the condition S3(L(x, y, z)) = 0, then associating the

instability with a ﬂow separation phenomenon, gives the standard relation (see any textbook

on hydrodynamics):

p = ν

4 Dissipation anomaly. Calculation of spatial deriva-

tives

Similar result is obtained if we consider the dissipation anomaly introduced by Polyakov [9]

who was interested in turbulence generated by the random-force-driven Burgers equation.

Later Polyakov’s results have been generalized to the Navier-Stokes equations by Duchon and

Robert[24], Eyink [24] and Yakhot and Sreenivasan [18]. Interested in various characteristics

of the velocity ﬁeld, one often needs to calculate spatial derivatives deﬁned as usual:

∂xu = lim

The problem is that if the velocity ﬁeld is diﬀerentiable, then S3 = O(y3) and ∂yS3 →
This is in contradiction with the Kolmogorov relation stating ∂yS3 ∝ E
that in the ”inertial range” the velocity ﬁeld is singular. To resolve this problem, Polyakov

[9] introduced a limit-ordering procedure: 1. ν

It is interesting that the exponents µn for n < 1 are negative. This prediction is yet to

be tested experimentally. Evaluation of the high-order moments of the dissipation rate

involving the correlation functions S4n(η4n) in their respective analytic intervals requires

very high resolution of the velocity ﬁeld and is highly problematic.

Dissipation scales. According to its deﬁnition, the dissipation scale is a linear dimension

of a structure deﬁned by the local value of the Reynolds number Reη = ηδηu/ν = O(1).

This introduces a random ﬁeld. The probability density Q(η, Re, Reη) is found by ﬁxing

the displacement r = η and counting the events with ηδru/ν = Reη keeping the global

and local Reynolds numbers Re = urmsL/ν and Reη ﬁxed as parameters. Deﬁning η as

a scale at which the analytic and singular parts of velocity ﬁeld overlap, naturally leads

to the matching condition: P (δηu/ηa, η) = PD(δηu, η) where PD is the PDF of δru for the

displacement values from the ”dissipation” range r

This relation, which has been obtained by Benzi et al [27] from the multi-fractal formalism,

cannot be a consequence of the Kolmogorov (K41) theory. Indeed, unlike the expression (17)

based on the idea of the ﬂuctuating u.v. cut-oﬀ, the K41 dissipation scale ηK = const is a

number not related to δηu . Thus, since the ﬂuctuating dissipation scale is not compatible

with K41 and ”normal scaling”, this PDF is not realizable. If for consistency with K41, one

uses the constant dissipation scale, then the PDF is simply the one of δηK u which, in accord

with calculation of Sec 1, is a Gaussian.

6 Discussion and conclusions.

The theory presented in this paper is based on two principle assumptions : 1. The existence

of a length-scale L such that for r = L the odd-order moments S2n+1(L)

0. At this

≈

scale the energy ﬂux toward small scales sets up and the PDF P (δru, r = L) is close to the

Gaussian. This statement , consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations, has been tested

in both physical and numerical experiments [19]-[20]. The Gaussian PDF P (δLu, L) is not

unlike a large-scale boundary condition needed to solve the diﬀerential equations (7)-(8) for

the moments Sn,m.

2. The expression (3) for the ﬁrst two terms of the Taylor expansion

of the function ξn, consistent with the Holder inequality, is a good approximation to the

exponents of the ﬁrst 10-15 moments of velocity increments . The existence of a small

parameter in turbulence theory is highly problematic and numerical smallness of deviations

from the linear expression for not too large moment numbers n in (3) was helpful for the

theory developed above. The relations for the dissipation structures and ”dissipation” scales

η coming from the order-of-magnitude balancing of the terms in the exact equations for the

dissipation anomaly are well justiﬁed.

14

Using these assumptions we have shown that the calculated PDF of velocity diﬀerences

strongly deviates from the Log-normal distribution, ﬁrst obtained by Kolmogorov in 1962,

which even today is widely used in the literature. This diﬀerence stems from contributions

of the amplitudes A(n) to the integral (1). The amplitudes A(n) are ﬁxed by the large-scale

boundary conditions, leading to a natural conclusion: the small-scale dynamics are strongly

coupled to the large-scale phenomena. This may be a reason for a serious reexamination of

the very concept of the turbulence energy cascade which, within the framework of the present

development, seem neither possible nor needed. An accurate experimental and numerical

comparison of the measured and Log-normal PDFs of velocity increments may be extremely

important.

It has been shown [18] ( in a diﬀerent way this is also an element of the multi-fractal theory)

that the scales η form a random ﬁeld not necessarily related to the energy dissipation scales

but rather to the linear dimensions of various dissipation structures deﬁned by the local

value of the Reynolds number Reη = O(1). Some of these structures are responsible for

the energy and the second-order moment S2,0 dissipation, while others, more powerful,

for

the dynamics of the higher -order moments. Thus, the scale η must be perceived as a

dynamic cut-oﬀ separating analytic and singular components of the velocity ﬁeld. The

probability density Q(η, Re), calculated in Section 5 is an interesting and easily measurable

quantity. A note of caution is in order: to make reliable calculations or measurements of the

moments involving spatial derivatives of velocity ﬁeld, one has to have a ﬁeld resolved well

enough to exhibit at least a fraction of the analytic range of the corresponding moments of

velocity increment. For example, according to (18), the second order moment of Lagrangian

acceleration is proportional to the sixth order structure function calculated on the scale η6,

while the fourth order one is expressed through S12(η12). In the high Reynolds number ﬂows,

the measurements of the twelveth order structure function including analytic range where
S12 ∝
fourth- order moment

r12 do not exist. The situation with the moments of dissipation rate is even worse:

4 is related to S16(η16). An interesting possibility is being explored

by Schumacher [28 ] running very large (10243) numerical simulations at reasonably low
Reynolds numbers Rλ ≈

Schumacher and Sreenivasan [29] obtained Q(η, Re) very similar to one shown on Fig. 3.

The results presented here were obtained from analysis, both theoretical and numerical, of

the dynamic equations. No multi-fractal assumptions have been made. Still, it is interesting

to compare the two approaches. In its present form, the multi-fractal (MF) theory consists

of two parts [1]. The ﬁrst one based on an idea of fractal dimension, attempts to explain the

origin of anomalous scaling by assuming

No steepest descent approximation has been used in deriving this relation. If in accord with

derivation which did not involve the steepest descent evaluation of the integral does not

have a ”Log-problem”, discussed in Ref.

[30]. The experimental measurements of Cramer

function f (α) = D(h) + 2 for h = α/3 by Meneveau and Sreenivasan [31] (See also Ref.[1])

are in an extremely close agreement with this expression. The quantitative diﬀerences are:

the maximum of the calculated curve (with α = 3h) is at α = 1.15 (instead of α = 1 of Ref.
[31]) and f (α) = 0 at α1 = 0.369 and α2 = 1.92 compared with α1 ≈
Ref.[31]. The small deviations come from the diﬀerence between h = α/3 used for analysis

0.5 and α2 ≈

1.8 of

of experimental data and the theoretically obtained h = a = 0.383. This diﬀerence decreases

if the coordinates are rescaled by factor 0.383/0.333.

based on the relation (Paladin and Vulpiani [32] )

obtained by combining the MF assumption (27) and the outcome of the balance of the

advective and viscous contributions to the Navier-Stokes equations. All small-scale results

derived using the MF formalism are numerically indistinguishable from the ones obtained

both above and in the Ref. [18]. To illustrate this point, we present an alternative derivation

of the moments of velocity derivative due to Polyakov [33].

which is identical to the formula (8.76) of Frisch’s book [1] obtained using multi-fractal

theory. Comparing the relations (35) and (22) we ﬁnd that , on the accepted magnitudes of

exponents ξn, numerically they are basically identical for not too large moment numbers n.

It is also easy to see that if in the limit n

have the same asymptotics.

The only approximation involved in derivations of both relations (22) and (35), presented in

this paper, is the choice of the cut-oﬀ η = ν/u instead of η = O(ν/u). In reality, there exist

a random ﬁeld of the dissipation scales described by the probability density Q(η, Re) given

18

by (25). Thus, a more accurate calculation of both (22) and (34) must involve averaging over

the ﬂuctuating cut- oﬀ η. However, we do not expect this procedure to introduce substantial

modiﬁcations of the obtained results.

The theory presented here does not involve any multi-fractal assumptions. Still, the quanti-

tative (numerical) agreements between the two approaches hints on the possibility of some

qualitative connection. The essentially dynamic theory developed here couples the velocity

ﬂuctuations at the largest and smallest scales. One may speculate that if a typical structure

is basically a strongly convoluted sheet with two O(L) linear dimensions and O(η) the third

one, then these structures can loosely be identiﬁed with the multi-ifractal sets of the MF

theory.

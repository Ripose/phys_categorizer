Perturbation Theory for Traveling Droplets

(Dated: July 29, 2013)

Motion of chemically driven droplets is analyzed by applying a solvability condition of perturbed
hydrodynamic equations aﬀected by the adsorbate concentration. Conditions for traveling bifurca-
tion analogous to a similar transition in activator-inhibitor systems are obtained. It is shown that
interaction of droplets leads to either scattering of mobile droplets or formation of regular patterns,
respectively, at low or high adsorbate diﬀusivity. The same method is applied to droplets running
on growing terrace edges during surface freezing.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Spontaneous motion of droplets on solid substrate
driven by chemical reactions that inﬂuence wetting prop-
erties has been observed in a number of experiments
[1, 2, 3, 4]. More recently, a reversible setup allowing for
restoration of substrate properties and thereby making
permanent motion possible has been realized experimen-
tally [5, 6]. Spontaneous motion has been observed also
in processes of surface freezing and melting [7]. The cause
of chemically driven motion is deposition of a poorly wet-
table material on the substrate or, alternatively, dissolu-
tion of an adsorbed wettable layer beneath the droplet.
As a result, the droplet tends to migrate to the area with
more favorable wetting properties outside its footprint.
The direction of motion, originally chosen at random,
is sustained because the area left behind is either per-
manently left nonwettable or takes time being restored.
Chemically driven motion is of interest both in microﬂu-
idics applications and as a possible mechanism for the
formation of surface patterns.

The theoretical model of chemically driven droplet mo-
tion presented recently [8, 9] combined hydrodynamic
equations in lubrication approximation with a linear
reaction-diﬀusion equation for adsorbed species. The
model included a precursor layer that served to resolve
the contact line singularity. The model equations were
solved numerically, mapping the regimes of motion and
its dependence on various parameters of the problem.
The results showed, in particular, that droplets become
immobile when diﬀusion and substrate modiﬁcation are
suﬃciently fast. The computations were, however, re-
stricted to moderate ratios of the bulk droplet size to the
precursor layer thickness, since numerical routines are all
but impossible to implement for realistic very large ra-
tios.

In this communication, I present an analytical solu-
tion of the problem combining an integral solution of
the reaction-diﬀusion equation for a steadily propagating
droplet [10] with velocity computation using the solvabil-
ity condition of perturbed hydrodynamic equations. The
hydrodynamic problem is considered in Section II. The
approach, based on the lubrication approximation, is the
same as in the theory of creeping motion of droplets un-

der the action of externally imposed gradients. The per-
turbation approach to the problem of motion driven by
surface inhomogeneities was pioneered by Greenspan [11]
who had, however, to rely on a phenomenological relation
for the motion of the contact line. Brochard [12] de-
rived droplet translation velocity using integral balances
between various driving forces and viscous dissipation.
The latter poses a special problem in view of the notori-
ous contact line singularity, which can be resolved either
by introducing a slip length [13, 14] or by allowing for an
ultrathin precursor layer [15]. The latter approach has
been applied to derive integral conditions for a droplet
driven either by an external ﬁeld (gravity) or changes in
the precursor thickness due to droplet interactions [16].
The result, applied later also to 2D droplets driven by
a diﬀerence of advancing and receding contact angles,
turned out to give even better approximation than more
elaborate theory using a precise solution of lubrication
equations to compute the shape of the bulk droplet [17].

The integral condition for droplet motion will be de-
rived in Section II B in a more formal way as a solvability
condition of perturbation equations, using an eigenfunc-
tion of the adjoint problem introduced earlier for a 2D
problem [18]. The contact line singularity will be re-
solved, however, in a more traditional way through in-
troducing a slip length, and the solvability condition will
be re-derived for this model. Both approaches to elimi-
nating the singularity are indistinguishable on a macro-
scopic level, leading to a model-dependent logarithmic
factor [19], and therefore the result does not need to rest
on the existence of a macroscopic precursor or depend
on a precise way the hydrodynamic equations have to be
modiﬁed in the immediate vicinity of the substrate.

In Sections III and IV, I shall concentrate on the re-
versible setup of Refs. [5, 6]. The basic approach is de-
scribed in Section II, followed by the velocity computa-
tion for a single steadily propagating droplet both in fast
(Section III B) and slow (Section III C) diﬀusion limits
and in a general case (Section III D). The principal re-
sult obtained in the fast diﬀusion (slow velocity) limit is
the existence of a supercritical traveling bifurcation anal-
ogous to a similar transition in activator-inhibitor sys-
tems [20, 21]. I further investigate droplet interactions
on either side of this transition, resulting in relaxation

freezing or melting is brieﬂy considered in Section V.

be obtained from the ﬁrst-order equation obtained by ex-
panding Eq. (3) in δ. It turns out, however, that a rela-
tion between the velocity and the contact angle distortion
can be obtained without actually solving this equation;
it is suﬃcient to compute its solvability condition.

try is weak, so that the motion is slow and the change of

III. CHEMICAL SELF-PROPULSION

A. Surfactant distribution

Variation of the contact angle is caused by substrate
modiﬁcation, e.g. dissolution of the surfactant adsorbed
on the substrate in experiments of Sumino et al.
[5, 6]
(Fig. 1). We write the the adsorption-diﬀusion equation
for the surfactant coverage on the substrate in the di-
mensionless form

ct =

2c

∇

−

c + H(x).

(18)

Here H(x) equals to 1 outside and 0 inside the droplet
footprint. The surfactant coverage c is scaled by the
coverage in equilibrium with the surfactant concentra-
tion in the continuous phase, time by the inverse adsorp-
tion/desorption rate constant k (which are assumed for
D/k, where D

is the surfactant diﬀusivity on the substrate.

The solution of this equation can be expressed with the
help of an appropriate Green’s function through an in-
tegral over the droplet footprint area and subsequently
transformed into a contour integral with the help of the
Gauss theorem [10]. For a circular contour with a dimen-
k/D, the con-
sionless radius (Thiele modulus) a = R
centration on its boundary, which determines the propa-
gation speed, is computed in this way as

radial dependence of the critical value of the parameter
µd, such as seen in Fig. 3.

IV. DROPLET INTERACTIONS

A. Relaxation to a Stationary Pattern

At high diﬀusivities when droplets do not travel spon-
taneously, they still can move under the inﬂuence of mu-
tual interactions. The surfactant depletion in the far
ﬁeld of a stationary droplet (at distances far exceeding its
radius) is well approximated by the stationary solution
c and H(x), by the delta-
Eq. (18) with c replaced by
function multiplied by the droplet area:

c =

e

(35)

The circular symmetry of the surfactant distribution
around a single droplet is perturbed by the far ﬁeld of its
neighbors. The resulting repelling interaction induces,
according to Eq. (17), motion with the velocity propor-
tional to the concentration gradient at the droplet lo-
cation. If there is a number of droplets, their action is

In a conﬁned region, the potential is expected to be
minimized by a regular hexagonal pattern with spac-
ing dependent on the number density of droplets. This
is demonstrated by an example of evolution shown in
Fig. 6. The conﬁnement is eﬀected in this computation
by a centripetal external potential. One can see that evo-
lution starting from a random arrangement of droplets
evolves to regular pattern where circles mark ﬁnal posi-
tions falling on a hexagonal grid. This might be a prac-
tical way to arrange a regular dewetting pattern on a
homogeneous substrate.

the far ﬁeld. The problem remains tractable in the qua-
sistationary approximation as long as velocity induced
by interaction is much smaller than the speed of self-
propelled motion. Otherwise, the far ﬁeld becomes de-
pendent on the entire history of motion, and solving the
full non-stationary problem (18) is necessary.

Consider as an example two droplets of equal size prop-
agating along the x axis with identical speed v on an-
tiparallel trajectories shifted by the interval 2Y , as in
Fig. 8. Since a deﬂected droplet keeps moving on a per-
turbed course, the scattering action is equivalent to ac-
celeration in the direction normal to self-propelled mo-
tion. Restricting to the quasistationary approximation,
the dynamic equation for the deviation

Neglecting the change of the velocity component along

A typical trajectory obtained by integration is shown in
Fig. 8 and a more quantitative example of the change
of the scattering angle with distance is shown in Fig. 9.

Take note that, due to a faster decay of depletion ahead of
the droplet, scattering largely accumulates already after
the droplets have passed the point of closest approach.

V. SURFACE FREEZING AND MELTING

A diﬀerent mechanism of spontaneous motion has been
observed in processes of surface freezing and melting [7].
In these experiments, liquid alkane wets silicon substrate
better than a frozen smectic layer. Respectively, the equi-
librium contact angle increases with growing thickness of
smectic, and a droplet tends to slip to a lower level when
placed at a terrace edge.

For a droplet sitting on a terrace as shown in Fig. 11(a),
< ψ and
θ has distinct constant values on segments
< π. The contact angle is smaller at the lower
ψ <
terrace, which we place on the right; we take this value
e
as θ0 and denote the contact angle at the higher terrace
θ. Then the velocity deﬁned by Eq. (17) is
as θ0 +

During freezing, the change of the angular front position

droplet with a constant velocity C obeys R sin ψ dψ =
C dt. Due to the droplet motion, the net front velocity

(44)

The stationary position is ψ0 = arcsin(C/U0); U0 is the
maximum speed allowing for ths equilibrium. The con-
ﬁguration is stable at cos ψ < 0, i.e. ψ > π/2. Under this
condition, the length of the line where the contact angles
on the advancing and receding sides decreases when the
droplet slides ahead, so that the freezing front catches
up and the stationary conﬁguration is restored. An-
other equilibrium position at ψ < π/2 is unstable. This
is in agreement with the disposition seen in Fig. 11(b)
taken from the experimental freezing sequence [22]. The
droplet travels forward, while its tail is hooked to the
frozen terrace left behind. Stabilization at an obtuse an-
gle, which is possible only in 3D, makes unnecessary a
hypothetic synchronization mechanism through heat ex-
changed invoked in earlier 2D computations [23].

One could expect such an equilibrium conﬁguration
to be impossible during melting when the directions of
motion of the phase transition front and the droplet slip
given by Eq. (17) are opposite. This equation, however,
is not applicable during melting transition, since, unlike
freezing when the back part of the droplet sits on the
terrace it has created, the droplet formed as a result of
melting is attached to the high-energy side surface of the
smectic layer on the melting edge, and is carried along as
this edge propagates [7].

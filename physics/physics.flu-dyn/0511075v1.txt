ANALYTIC STUDY OF SHELL MODELS OF TURBULENCE

PETER CONSTANTIN, BORIS LEVANT, AND EDRISS S. TITI

Abstract. In this paper we study analytically the viscous sabra shell model
of energy turbulent cascade. We prove the global regularity of solutions and
show that the shell model has ﬁnitely many asymptotic degrees of freedom,
speciﬁcally: a ﬁnite dimensional global attractor and globally invariant inertial
manifolds. Moreover, we establish the existence of exponentially decaying
energy dissipation range.

Key words: Turbulence, Dynamic models, Shell models, Navier–Stokes equa-

tions.

1. Introduction

Shell models of turbulence have attracted interest as useful phenomenological
models that retain certain features of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). Their
central computational advantage is the parameterization of the ﬂuctuation of a
λn+1 by very few repre-
turbulent ﬁeld in each octave of wave numbers λn <
sentative variables. The octaves of wave numbers are called shells and the variables
retained are called shell variables. Like in the Fourier representation of NSE, the
time evolution of the shell variables is governed by an inﬁnite system of coupled
ordinary diﬀerential equations with quadratic nonlinearities, with forcing applied
to the large scales and viscous dissipation eﬀecting the smaller ones. Because of
the very reduced number of interactions in each octave of wave numbers, the shell
models are drastic modiﬁcation of the original NSE in Fourier space.

The main object of this work is the “sabra” shell model of turbulence, which was
introduced in [26]. It is worth noting that the results of this article apply equally
well to the well-known Gledzer-Okhitani-Yamada (GOY) shell model, introduced
in [31]. For other shell models see [4], [12], [13], [31]. A recent review of the subject
emphasizing the applications of the shell models to the study of the energy-cascade
mechanism in turbulence can be found in [2].

The sabra shell model of turbulence describes the evolution of complex Fourier-
like components of a scalar velocity ﬁeld denoted by un. The associated one-
dimensional wavenumbers are denoted by kn, where the discrete index n is referred
to as the “shell index”. The equations of motion of the sabra shell model of turbu-
lence have the following form

scale of the model. In an analogy to the Navier-Stokes equations ν > 0 represents
a kinematic viscosity and fn are the Fourier components of the forcing.

The three parameters of the model a, b and c are real. In order for the sabra
shell model to be a system of the hydrodynamic type we require that in the inviscid
(ν = 0) and unforced (fn = 0, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) case the model will have at least one
quadratic invariant. Requiring conservation of the energy

leads to the following relation between the parameters of the model, which we will

The well-known question of global well-posedness of the 3D Navier-Stokes equa-
tions is a major open problem. In this work we study analytically the shell model
(1). Speciﬁcally, we show global regularity of weak and strong solutions of (1)
and smooth dependence on the initial data. This is a basic step for studying the
long-time behavior of this system and for establishing the existence of a ﬁnite di-
mensional global attractor.

Our next result concerns the rate of the decay of the spectrum (i. e.
un|
) as func-

decays

tion of n. Having shown the existence of strong solutions, we prove that
|
exponentially with n for n large enough, depending on the physical parameters of
the model. However, if we assume that the forcing fn decays super-exponentially,
which is a reasonable assumption, because in most numerical simulations the forc-
ing is concentrated in only ﬁnitely many shells, then we can show more. In fact,
following the arguments presented in [21] and [20] we show that in this case the
solution of (1) belongs to a certain Gevrey class of regularity, namely
also de-
cays super-exponentially in n – an evidence of the existence of a dissipation range
associated with this system, which is an observed feature of turbulent ﬂows (see
also [11] for similar results concerning 3D turbulence).

un|
|

Classical theories of turbulence assert that the turbulent ﬂows governed by the
Navier-Stokes equations have ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom (see, e.g., [13],
[25]). Arguing in the same vein one can state that the sabra shell model with non-
zero viscosity has ﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. Such a physical statement can
be interpreted mathematically in more than one way: as ﬁnite dimensionality of the
global attractor, as existence of ﬁnitely many determining modes, and as existence
of ﬁnite dimensional inertial manifold.

Our ﬁrst results concern the long time behavior of the solutions of the system
(1). We show that the global attractor of the sabra model has a ﬁnite fractal and
Hausdorﬀ dimensions. Moreover, we show that the number of the determining
modes of the sabra shell model equations is also ﬁnite. Remarkably, our upper
bounds for the number of the determining modes and the fractal and Hausdorﬀ
dimensions of the global attractor of the sabra shell model equation coincide (see

4

P. CONSTANTIN, B. LEVANT, AND E. S. TITI

Remark 1). This is to be contrasted with the present knowledge about Navier-
Stokes equations, where the two bounds are qualitatively diﬀerent.

Finally, and again in contrast with the present knowledge for the Navier-Stokes
equations, we show that the sabra shell model equation has an inertial manifold
. Inertial manifolds are ﬁnite dimensional Lipschitz globally invariant manifolds
M
that attract all bounded sets in the phase space at an exponential rate and, in
= graph(Φ), where Φ
particular, contain the global attractor. We show that

i.e. ν, f , λ, a, b, and c. The reduction of the system (1) to the manifold
a ﬁnite dimensional system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. This is the ultimate
and best notion of system reduction that one could hope for. In other words, an
inertial manifold is an exact rule for parameterizing the large modes (inﬁnite many
of them) in terms of the low ones (ﬁnitely many of them). The concept of inertial
manifold for nonlinear evolution equations was ﬁrst introduced in [17] (see also [8],
[9], [18], [33], [35]).

3. Existence of Weak Solutions

In this section we prove the existence of weak solutions to the system (9). Our
notion of weak solutions is similar to that of the Navier-Stokes equation (see, for
example, [5], [34]).

Proof. The proof follows standard techniques for equations of Navier-Stokes type.
See, for example, ([5], [34] or [35]). We will use the Galerkin procedure to prove
the global existence and to establish the necessary a priori estimates.

mensional system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

um(x, 0) = Pmuin(x).
We observe that the nonlinear term is quadratic in um, thus by the theory of
ordinary diﬀerential equations, the system (25) possesses a unique solution for a
short interval of time. Denote by [0, Tm) the maximal interval of existence for
positive time. We will show later that in fact, Tm = T .

4. Uniqueness of Weak Solutions

Next we show that the weak solutions depend continuously on the initial data

and in particular the solutions are unique.

Theorem 3. Let u(t), v(t) be two diﬀerent solutions to the equation (9) on the time
interval [0, T ] with the corresponding initial conditions uin and vin in H. Then, for
every t

shell model equation (9) possesses even more regular solutions under an appropriate
assumptions.

Let um be the solution of the Galerkin system (25). Taking the scalar product of
the equation (25a) with Aum, and using Young and Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities

τ , for some p, q
sponding wavenumbers kn, deﬁned by relation (2). Then, if u
and τ , then the function g(x) is analytic. The concept of the Gevrey class regularity
for showing the analyticity of the solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations, was ﬁrst introduced in [20], simplifying earlier proofs. Later this tech-
nique was extended to the large class of analytic nonlinear parabolic equations in

7. Global Attractors and Their Dimensions

A

The ﬁrst mathematical concept which we use to establish the ﬁnite dimensional
long-term behavior of the viscous sabra shell model is the global attractor. The
global attractor,
, is the maximal bounded invariant subset of the space H. It
encompasses all of the possible permanent regimes of the dynamics of the shell
model. It is also a compact subset of the space H which attracts all the trajectories
of the system. Establishment of ﬁnite Hausdorﬀ and fractal dimensionality of the
global attractor implies the possible parameterization of the permanent regimes of
the dynamics in terms of a ﬁnite number of parameters. For the deﬁnition and
further discussion of the concept of the global attractor see, e.g., [14] and [35].

In analogy with Kolmogorov’s mean rate of dissipation of energy in turbulent

ﬂow we deﬁne

ǫ = ν

the ensemble average or a long-time average. Since we do not know whether such
long-time averages converge for trajectories we will replace the above deﬁnition of
ǫ by

We will also deﬁne the viscous dissipation length scale ld. According to Kol-
mogorov’s theory, it should only depend on the viscosity ν and the mean rate
of energy dissipation ǫ. Hence, pure dimensional arguments lead to the deﬁnition

which represents the largest spatial scale at which the viscosity term begins to
dominate over the nonlinear inertial term of the shell model equation. In analogy
with the conventional theory of turbulence this is also the smallest scale that one
needs to resolve in order to get the full resolution for turbulent ﬂow associated with
the shell model system.

We would like to obtain an estimate of the fractal dimension of the global attrac-
tor for the system (9) in terms of another non-dimensional quantity – the generalized
L∞([0, T ], H) and denote
Grashoﬀ number. Suppose the forcing term satisﬁes f
. Then we deﬁne the generalized Grashoﬀ number for our

The generalized Grashoﬀ number was ﬁrst introduced in the context of the study of
the ﬁnite dimensionality of long-term behavior of turbulent ﬂow in [15]. To check
that it is indeed non-dimensional we note that
([0,T ],H) has the dimension of
T 2 , were L is a length scale and T is a time scale. k1 has the dimension of 1
L
L and
the kinematic viscosity ν has the dimension of L2
T . In order to obtain an estimate
of the generalized Grashoﬀ number, which will be used in the proof of the main
result of this section, we can apply inequality get

Remark 1. The existence of the determining modes for the Navier-Stokes equations
both in two and three dimensions is known (see, e.g., [7] [14], [24] and reference
therein). However, there exists a gap between the upper bounds for the lowest
number of determining modes and the dimension of the global attractor for the
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations both for the no-slip and periodic boundary
conditions. Our upper bounds for the dimension of the global attractor and for the
number of determining modes for the sabra shell model equation coincides. Recently
it was shown in [22] that a similar result is also true for the damped-driven NSE
and the Stommel-Charney barotropic model of ocean circulation.

9. Existence of Inertial Manifolds

In this section we prove the existence of a ﬁnite-dimensional inertial manifold
(IM). The concept of inertial manifold for nonlinear evolution equations was ﬁrst
introduced in [17] (see also, e.g., [5], [8], [9], [18], [33], [35]). An inertial manifold is a
ﬁnite dimensional Lipschitz, globally invariant manifold which attracts all bounded
sets in the phase space at an exponential rate and, consequently, contains the global
attractor. In fact, one can show that the IM is smoother, in particular C1 (see, e.g.,
[10], [32], [33]). The smoothness and invariance under the reduced dynamics of the
IM implies that a ﬁnite system of ordinary diﬀerential equations is equivalent to the
original inﬁnite system. This is the ultimate and best notion of system reduction
that one could hope for. In other words, an IM is an exact rule for parameterizing
the large modes (inﬁnite many of them) in terms of the low ones (ﬁnitely many of
them).

In this section we use Theorem 3.1 of [18] to show the existence of inertial
manifolds for the system (9) and to estimate its dimension. Let us state Theorem
3.1 of [18] in the following way (see also [35], Chapter VIII, Theorem 3.1)

ρ is the radius of the absorbing ball in D(A), which existence is provided by Propo-

Then the equation (80) possesses an inertial manifold of dimension N .

In order to apply the Theorem, we need to show that the sabra model equation
satisﬁes the properties of the abstract framework of [18]. Let us rewrite our system
(9) in the form

conclude that the sabra shell model possesses an inertial manifold.

10. Conclusions

We have established the global regularity of the sabra shell model of turbu-
lence. We shown analytically that the shell model enjoys some of the commonly
observed features of real world turbulent ﬂows. Speciﬁcally, we have established
using the Gevrey regularity technique the existence of an exponentially decaying
dissipation range. Moreover, we have provided explicit upper bounds, in terms
of the given parameters of the shell model, for the number asymptotic degrees of
freedom. Namely, we presented explicit estimates for the dimension of the global
attractor and for the number of determining modes. We have also shown that the
shell model possess a ﬁnite dimensional inertial manifold. That is, there exists an
exact rule which parameterizes the small scales as a function of the large scales.
The existence of inertial manifolds is not known for the Navier-Stokes equations. It
is worth mentioning that the tools presented here can be equally applied to other
shell models.

The existence of the absorbing ball in the space V readily follows from Theorem 4.
However, the exact formula for the radius of the absorbing ball is much more
involved.

≥

We already mentioned that if we assume that the forcing f belongs to some
0, then the existence of absorbing balls for solutions of the
Gevrey class for all t
equation (9) in the norms of V and D(A) follows from the fact that in that case
all the functions belonging to the global attractor are in some Gevrey class and
hence are bounded in all weaker norms. In the current section we will show that
the strong assumption on the force f to be in the Gevrey class could be dropped.
Our proof follows [19] (see also [5], ch. 12).

Fix m

N, let Pm be the projection of H onto the ﬁrst m coordinates and

denote

Pmu = um.
Recall that the Galerkin approximating system (25) of order m for equation (9) is
an m - dimensional system of ordinary diﬀerential equations.

Theorems 2 and 3 shows in fact, that the initial-value problem (9) is well posed.
This allows us to deﬁne the semigroup S(t), i.e., the one parameter semigroup
family of operators

S(t) : uin

which are bounded for almost all t
S(t) : H
H is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the intial data. The purpose
of this section is to show that this mapping is also Fr´echet diﬀerentiable with respect
to the initial data (see, e.g., [35] (ch. VI, 8)).

First of all we wish to linearize the non-linear term. Let us ﬁx T > 0 and let
L2([0, T ], V ) be solutions of the equation (9) with the initial
[0, T ] we can write

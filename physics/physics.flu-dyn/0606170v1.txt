Two-dimensional ﬂow of foam around a circular obstacle: local

measurements of elasticity, plasticity and ﬂow

Abstract

We investigate the two-dimensional ﬂow of a liquid foam around circular obstacles by measuring

all the local ﬁelds necessary to describe this ﬂow: velocity, pressure, bubble deformations and

rearrangements. We show how our experimental setup, a quasi-2D ”liquid pool” system, is adapted

to the determination of these ﬁelds: the velocity and bubble deformations are easy to measure

from 2D movies, and the pressure can be measured by exploiting a speciﬁc feature of this system,

a 2D eﬀective compressibility. To describe accurately bubble rearrangements, we propose a new,

tensorial descriptor. All these quantities are evaluated via an averaging procedure that we justify

showing that the ﬂuctuations of the ﬁelds are essentially random. The ﬂow is extensively studied

in a reference experimental case; the velocity presents an overshoot in the wake of the obstacle, the

pressure is maximum at the leading side and minimal at the trailing side. The study of the elastic

deformations and of the velocity gradients shows that the transition between plug ﬂow and yielded

regions is smooth. Our tensorial description of T1s highlight their correlation both with the bubble

deformations and the velocity gradients. A salient feature of the ﬂow, notably on the velocity and

T1 repartition, is a marked asymmetry upstream/downstream, signature of the elastic behaviour

of the foam. We show that the results do not change qualitatively when various control parameters

(ﬂow rate, bubble area, ﬂuid fraction, bulk viscosity, obstacle size and boundary conditions) vary,

identifying a robust quasistatic regime. These results are discussed in the frame of the actual foam

rheology literature, and we argue that they constitute a severe test for existing rheological models,

since they capture both the elastic, plastic and ﬂuid behaviour of the foam.

INTRODUCTION

Liquid foams have a ubiquitous mechanical behavior: depending on the strength of an

external applied solicitation, they can exhibit both elastic, plastic or viscous response ([23,

50]). This complex behavior is used in many industrial applications ([28]), like ore ﬂotation,

oil extraction, food and cosmetic industry. Liquid foams are also of fundamental interest as

models to study complex ﬂuids, since their constitutive item, the bubble, is experimentally

easily observable, contrary to colloids or polymers. The understanding of foam rheology

has motivated active research; a series of seminal studies has ﬁrst focused on the elastic

properties of foams, such as elastic moduli or yield stress ([15, 27, 40, 46]). The plasticity

of foams originates from topological rearrangements, called T1s (Fig. 2c). This coupling

between local rearrangements of constitutive entities and a macroscopic plastic behaviour is

a general feature of many materials (emulsions, pastes, slurries), that studies have described

generically as soft glassy materials ([45]). On the other hand, the research on the viscous

and dissipative properties of foams is rather recent ([7, 14, 17, 26]).

Much eﬀort is currently devoted to integrate elastic, plastic and viscous behaviours in a

single constitutive equation ([23, 51, Marmottant et al.]). To achieve such a goal, a ﬁne and

precise knowledge of the mechanical behavior of the foam is required. This is the reason why

foams are often studied in quasi-2D geometries ([11, 48]), where foams are conﬁned so that

they are only one bubble thick (conﬁnement either between two parallel plates, between one

horizontal plate and the surface of a soap solution, or at the free surface of a soap solution).

Imaging is easy in these quasi-2D geometries, contrary to an opaque 3D foam. A classical

way to study quasi-2D foams consists in using rheometric ﬂows ([32]), like simple shear ﬂows

([13, 33]), which are easy to analyze. The study of heterogeneous ﬂows is complementary:

it is less easy to analyze and to understand, but it enlarges the number of observed eﬀects.

This is the case for example for ﬂows in constrictions ([1]), or for Stokes experiments, i.e.

ﬂows around obstacles ([8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19]).

We studied extensively Stokes experiments for foams, focusing on the eﬀect of the foam

on the obstacle: drag ([16]), lift ([18]) or torque ([19]). The variations of these quantities

with various control parameters, especially the foam ﬂow rate, illustrate the interplay be-

tween elastic, plastic and viscous behavior of the foam. To go beyond these force and torque

measurements, we revisit here some of these experiments with the complementary approach,

3

studying by local measurements the eﬀect of the presence of an obstacle on a ﬂowing foam.

We present a method developed to analyze precisely and completely this local response,

quantiﬁed by various local ﬁelds. We extract velocity and velocity gradients, bubble defor-

mations, and pressure, which describe the elastic and viscous parts of the foam response.

We also deﬁne a new tensorial descriptor of the bubble rearrangements, and present the

corresponding ﬁeld, which quantiﬁes accurately foam plastic response. The results highlight

the diﬀerences of the foam local response with respect to simple viscoplastic and viscoelastic

responses, namely a marked up/downstream asymmetry, signature of a delayed, elastic re-

sponse of the foam, and a strong plastic response wherever the bubble deformation becomes

close to a critical, yield strain. Our results thus call for a modelisation coupling elastic, plas-

tic and ﬂuid behavior, and they also constitute an extensive database to test and constrain

such models.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Experiment

We perform a Stokes experiment ([1, 10, 12, 16]), i.e. we study the ﬂow of foam around

obstacles (Fig. 1), using a foam channel fully described in [16]. Brieﬂy, a tank is ﬁlled with

a bulk solution obtained by adding 1% of commercial dish-washing liquid (Taci, Henkel)

γ = 26.1

to desionised water. Its surface tension, measured with the oscillating bubble method, is
0.2 mN m−1, and its kinematic viscosity, measured with a capillary viscosimeter,
±
0.04 mm s−2 unless explicitly stated. Nitrogen is blown in the solution through a

nozzle or a tube at a computer controlled ﬂow rate. This generates a ”liquid pool foam”

foam [48], constituted by a horizontal monolayer of monodisperse bubbles (dispersity < 3%)

of average thickness h0, conﬁned between the bulk solution and a glass top plate. This is a

quasi-2D foam ([11, 48]): despite the 3D geometry of the bubbles (Fig. 1b), it experiences

2D horizontal ﬂows, which minimizes the eﬀect of drainage. Two others quasi-2D foams

exist: the bubble raft (no conﬁnement), and the Hele-Shaw cell (conﬁnement between two

horizontal plates). Contrary to these two systems, the liquid pool foam has an eﬀective in-

plane compressibility ([16]), which enables to measure pressure easily, as recalled in Section

II C 1. The ﬂuid fraction is adjusted by the foam thickness [42]; its value is 7%. The foam

ﬂows around an obstacle placed at the middle of the channel; in the present study, we choose
the ﬂow rate between 24 and 515 ml min−1 (corresponding velocities: 0.11 to 2.5 cm s−1).

In this paper, we will study a reference case characterized by the following values of the
parameters: circular obstacle of diameter 30 mm, ﬂow rate of 176 ml min−1, bubble area
of 16.0 mm2, foam thickness of 3.5 mm, and bulk viscosity of 1.06 mm2 s−1. We will then

study the inﬂuence of each control parameter separately.

This setup has allowed us to measure forces on obstacles ([16, 18]) and pressure drops

associated to the ﬂow of foam ([17]). For the purpose of the present paper, we record for

every experiment a stack of 750 images, representing a movie of 30 seconds. From these

movies, we extract all relevant quantities describing the ﬂow of foams: velocity, pressure,

elastic stress, bubble deformations, and bubble swapping (topological rearrangements, or

T1s) using a home-made procedure, as follows.

Image analysis

1. Skeletonisation of experimental images

With the NIH Image software, we invert the grey levels of the images, then threshold

our images, to clearly separate the black network of edges from white bubbles. We have

deﬁned several zones on the image each with diﬀerent thresholds, to compensate from slight

remaining spatial variations of light intensity. We ﬁnally extract the network of the bubble

edges from the experimental images by a classical skeletonisation procedure, which reduces

the foam to a network of one-pixel thick edges (Fig. 2a).

This procedure conserves the topology between the real and the skeletonized bubbles

(Figs. 1a and 2a), which enables a proper evaluation of the bubble deformation, as ex-

plained in Section II C 3. It has two limitations: ﬁrst, it distorts the geometry and curvature

of the bubbles edges and vertices, which prevents us from evaluating precisely the elastic

stress, since this requires integration along all edges ([3]). Second, it is not adapted to the

boundaries; we therefore systematically eliminate the data near the obstacle and the channel

walls.

the obstacle.

2. Treatment of skeletonized images

For a 2D skeletonized foam, the bubbles are bounded by thin edges, which merge in

threefold vertices. Bubbles are thus easily labelized, and a vertex can be unambiguously

deﬁned as a black pixel for which, among its eight neighboring pixels, one can ﬁnd three

pixels belonging to three diﬀerent bubbles. Boundaries vertices are deﬁned as pixels on

boundaries, with two neighboring pixels belonging to two diﬀerent bubbles.

We scan an image in two steps. In a ﬁrst step, each individual bubble is labelized with

a diﬀerent number. The program records a list of bubbles, each bubble being represented

by its number b, its number of pixels Nb, and the position ~xb of its barycenter. In a second

step, vertices are identiﬁed and labelized, and the program records them in a second list,

each vertex being represented by its number, its coordinates and the label of its neighboring

bubbles. The subsequent analysis does not require the image.

To compute the ﬁelds, we mesh the image by a rectangular grid. We have checked that

there exists a mesh size for which the results do not change (Fig. 3): this validates our

choice, and is a ﬁrst indication of the continuous character of the foam (see section III A).

We have chosen to mesh the image with a rectangular grid of 26

17 (nearly) square boxes of

×

side 6 mm: such a choice enables us to capture well the variations at the macroscopic scale,

and the statistics is suﬃcient for these variations to be smooth (during the whole movie,

about 2

103 bubbles are computed per box). For simplicity, each bubble is attributed to

×

the box where its center lies even if part of it belongs to other boxes.

3. Direct measurements from skeletonized images

From the list of bubbles, we compute the network of the vectors ~r linking two centers of

bubbles in contact, which we call the center network (Fig. 2b). To be precise, each vector

~r is attributed to the two boxes (with a coeﬃcient 1/2 each) of the two bubble centers it

over 750 images and all vectors in the box. This tensorial quantity has proven to be a

good descriptor of bubble deformation:

it reproduces the size, direction and amplitude of

deformation of bubbles, in studies where it has been computed over the bubble edges network
~ℓ ([1, 9, 24]). Here, we calculate it over the center network. With such a choice, the texture

tensor deﬁnition (1) is much more general than with the bubble edges network: it applies

to 3D foams, and to wet foams such as the ones considered hereby. It is also more robust,

because the center of masses, hence the vectors ~r, is much less biased by skeletonisation than

the bubble edges. Anyway, the two possible network choices are equivalent at low bubble

In order to compute the velocity ﬁeld, we compare successive frames. In the studied range

of ﬂow rates, the displacement of a bubble between two successive frames is small compared

to its size; the displacement of the bubble centers is thus easy to calculate, and we average

all displacements on each box to get the velocity ﬁeld (Eulerian rather than Lagrangian

deformation.

point of view).

The calculation of the T1s is also based on the correlation of two successive images; a

T1 is a topological neighbor-swapping event, during which a bubble edge disappears and

a new one is created (Fig. 2c). The program tracks independently the disappearing and

appearing edges, by comparing the list of edges of two successive frames. This decoupling

of the disappearing and appearing edges is necessary for two reasons: ﬁrst, the duration of

a T1 event may be longer than the time interval between two successive frames (0.04 s);

second, the transient fourfold vertex (middle of Fig. 2c) contains a certain amount of liquid.

After skeletonisation, this is often erroneously recognized as an artiﬁcial little four-sided

bubble between the four bubbles experiencing the T1, which we have to remove by impos-

ing a lower threshold on the bubble area. Actually, a T1 covers two distinct instantaneous

events: one disappearance and one apparition of a link between two bubbles. To a disap-

pearing (appearing) edge is associated the vector of the center network ~r− (~r+) which links

the centers of the two separating (attaching) bubbles. A complete quantiﬁcation of T1s,

including not only their frequency but also their direction, must rely on these vectors, whose

9

direction is irrelevant by deﬁnition. We thus deﬁne the tensors ¯¯T± = f±

f+ (f−) is the frequency of separation (attachment) events per link ~r of the center network

([Marmottant et al.]). Preliminary studies show that these tensors are closely related to the

mechanical properties of the foam ([Marmottant et al.]). However, in this paper, we use a
more intuitive deﬁnition, based on unit vectors: ¯¯T adim

C. Computation of the ﬁelds

We present here the relevant ﬁelds describing the ﬂow of foams, and the way they are

computed from the image analysis detailed in the previous section.

1. Pressure

As already mentioned in a previous study ([16]), in a quasi-2D setup with foam conﬁned

between a top plate and a liquid pool, the depth of bubbles adjust to pressure variations.

The 3D compressibility of the bubbles is negligible here: for an ideal, isothermal gas, the

compression modulus is of order 105 Pa, which is 4 orders of magnitude higher to the

measured local variations of pressure, as shown later (Fig. 11). Hence, the volume of a given

bubble is constant; but if its pressure increases, its depth increases to maintain equilibrium

with the hydrostatic pressure of the bulk solution, hence its visible area decreases: the foam

has an eﬀective 2D compressibility in the plane of the top plate. The precise relationship

between bubble area and pressure is established in another paper ([42]), in which we show

that the relative uncertainty in pressure equals 2%. It writes:

with ρ = 103 kg m−3 the volumetric mass of the solution, g = 9.8 m s−2 the gravity

acceleration, and

the constant bubble volume. Here, P0 is the local reference pressure,

which embodies the constant pressure gradient along the channel ([17]): hence, P

the local variation of pressure due to the presence of the obstacle. The average bubble area

is easily computed in each box with the image analysis program. Since the pressure ﬁeld is

scalar, it is convenient to represent it in gray levels.

2. Velocity and velocity gradients

The image analysis program provides directly the velocity ﬁeld, which we represent as

usual with arrows. The velocity gradient is computed by ﬁnite diﬀerences; we evaluate

this gradient in the middle of the four boxes (i, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j) and (i + 1, j + 1).
We rather use the symmetric velocity gradient, the deformation rate: ¯¯D = (

3. Tensorial ﬁelds: texture, statistical elastic strain, T1

As stated in Section II B 2, we use the texture tensor as a descriptor of bubble deforma-

tions. To be more quantitative, we will use the statistical elastic strain tensor, deﬁned as

([2]):

¯¯U =

(ln ¯¯M

ln ¯¯M0),

−

(3)

where ¯¯M0 is a reference value, that we choose isotropic: ¯¯M0 = λ0

¯¯I. Here, λ0 is the average of

the eigenvalues of the texture tensors evaluated at the upstream and downstream extremities

of the observation ﬁeld (left and right on Fig. 1), where the bubbles are less perturbed by
the presence of the obstacle, and ¯¯I is the 2D identity tensor. We use the statistical elastic

strain tensor because it quantiﬁes the elastic strain in foams, extending the classical elastic

strain ([30]) to plastic ﬂows. The trace of this tensor quantiﬁes the relative variation of

area of the bubbles, which remains lower than 10% ([16]); hence, in general, this tensor will

have a positive eigenvalue and a negative one. We choose to represent such a tensor by

two orthogonal lines, as explained in Fig. 4a. The positive (negative) eigenvector represent

the direction and amplitude of traction (compression) of deformed bubbles compared to

the reference state. We also use this representation for the deformation rate which, like

the statistical elastic strain, is an almost traceless tensor, since the ﬂow remains weakly

compressible. Here, the positive (negative) eigenvector represent the direction and amplitude

of maximal elongation (compression) rate.

Finally, we represent the T1s by the two tensors ¯¯T adim

and ¯¯T adim

III. RESULTS

In this section, we present the local measurements for a foam ﬂowing around an obstacle.

We ﬁrst focus on a reference case: the ﬂow of a monodisperse foam (bubble area: 16.0 mm2,
foam thickness: 3.5 mm, bulk viscosity: 1.06 mm2 s−1, ﬂow rate: 176 ml min−1) around a

circular obstacle of diameter 30 mm. We compare averages and ﬂuctuations of a local ﬁeld

to show that the foam behaves like a continuous medium (section III A). We then present

a full study of the reference case (section III B), and separate the inﬂuence of each control

parameter (section III C).

12

A. Averages versus ﬂuctuations

Can we consider the foam as a continuous medium in our case? This is not obvious

a priori, since the steady ﬂow arises from a balance between the load experienced by the

bubbles passing around the obstacle, and the discrete relaxations occurring during T1 events

([31]): locally-deﬁned quantities like elastic stress or statistical elastic strain ﬂuctuate around

an average value. We consider here the inﬂuence of such ﬂuctuations and their correlations,

since various studies have shown their great importance, especially when T1 avalanches

occur ([13, 25]), leading to strong stress drops ([33, 39]).

To address this question, we analyse the temporal ﬂuctuations of a local quantity for our

reference case, in the same spirit as ([24]). We have chosen the statistical elastic strain tensor
¯¯U, but the analysis would be similar on other local quantities such as velocity or pressure.
More precisely, we have chosen to analyse one scalar quantity extracted from ¯¯U: the square
λ−( ¯¯U)]2. This quantity scales as
of the diﬀerence between the two eigenvalues [λ+( ¯¯U)

−

the elastic energy associated to shear strain; hence, it is expected to exhibit some huge

drops if T1 avalanches occur, since they release a lot of elastic energy. We have analysed

the ﬂuctuations in a box close to the trailing side of the obstacle (Fig. 5a, right), where

ﬂuctuations are expected to be strong; we will see later that this is also a region where T1s

are frequent. The temporal variations of the bubble deformation is reported in Fig. 5a.

Qualitatively, we do not observe a behavior dominated by T1 avalanches: such a behavior

would correspond to a succession of low increases (load) and quick drops (relaxation) of the

elastic energy. Quantitatively, we analyse the increments of the bubble deformation between

two successive images, and report the histogram of the distribution of these increments in

Fig. 6a. This histogram is well ﬁtted by a Gaussian curve, characteristic of a white noise,

and we do not observe an asymmetric distribution with a lot of small increases and a number

of large decreases, which would correspond to T1 avalanches.

However, the considered box is a small box, where only seven bubbles in average are

present at a given instant. One could thus argue that ﬂuctuations are dominated by advec-

tion, not by possible T1 avalanches occurring at larger scale. We thus analyse the ﬂuctuations

at a larger scale, choosing a box 18 times bigger, in the wake of the obstacle (Fig. 5b, right).

The relative ﬂuctuations are much smaller (Fig. 5b), and the increments are here again well

ﬁtted by a Gaussian curve (Fig. 6b).

We have performed this quantitative analysis of the ﬂuctuations only in our reference

experiment, but we observed in the other experiments analysed here that the ﬂuctuations

do not present large-scale correlations; they are similar to a random, white noise and play a

negligible role at large scales. We will thus only focus on coarse-grained average quantities,

and treat the foam as a continuous medium. The generality of such an approach is discussed

in Section IV A.

B. Study of a reference case

For each studied ﬁeld, we proceed as follows: we ﬁrst present a map of the whole ﬁeld,

and we then study the variation of the ﬁeld components along various lines: two directed

streamwise, one on the axis of the obstacle and another aside, at 2.5 cm from the axis of

symmetry of the ﬂow; and three directed spanwise: one passing through the center of the

obstacle, one upstream and the symmetric downstream one, both lines being at 2.4 cm from

the middle axis (Fig. 7).

1. Velocity

The whole velocity ﬁeld is presented in Fig. 8. Qualitatively, the ﬂow far from the

obstacle is a plug ﬂow, as already observed for foam ﬂows in narrow channels ([6]). The

obstacle imposes two symmetric stagnation points, one upstream and one downstream, and

the ﬂow is constricted, thus accelerated, on the sides of the obstacle.

To study quantitatively the velocity, we divide it by the averaged velocity v0 obtained

from the upstream and downstream extremities of the observation region, where the ﬂow is

less perturbed: v0 is therefore the velocity of the plug ﬂow. We report the two components

of (~v

~v0)/v0, which is the dimensionless velocity deviation from the plug ﬂow, in Fig.

−

9. This ﬁgure shows a striking feature: the velocity is asymmetric up/downstream. More

precisely, on the axis y = 0, the component vx shows an overshoot upstream, whereas it

decreases monotonically downstream. The asymmetry is also obvious for the comparison of

vx between the axis x =

2.4 and 2.4 cm: the perturbation from the plug ﬂow is higher

on the y = 0 axis.

2. Pressure

The whole pressure ﬁeld is presented in Fig. 10. The pressure is maximal at the leading

side of the obstacle, and is minimal at its trailing side. We can also note that the increase of

pressure upstream is very progressive, extending farther than the limits of the observation

ﬁeld. Fig. 11 displays the evolution of the pressure along the ﬁve axes of Fig. 7. We also

observe an asymmetry up/downstream; contrary to the velocity, this asymmetry is more

obvious on the side of the obstacle than on the axis y = 0: the pressure perturbation changes

pressure with the distance to the obstacle is quicker than the perturbation in velocity.

3. Statistical elastic strain

We now study the statistical elastic strain ﬁeld, deﬁned by Eq.

(3), to quantify the

bubble deformation, as explained in Section II C 3. We display this ﬁeld in Fig. 12 using the

representation explained in Fig. 4b. We note that the deformation is not negligible for the

bubbles entering the observation ﬁeld: they are slightly stretched in the spanwise direction.

The bubbles are stretched in the x direction on the sides and in the wake of the obstacle,

and in the y direction at the leading side of the obstacle and on the sides of the wake.

The statistical elastic strain ﬁeld ¯¯U is a symmetric tensor, hence it has three indepen-

dent components Uxx, Uxy and Uyy. Instead of these three components, we have chosen to

represent the combinations Uxx + Uyy, Uxx

FIG. 11: Pressure evolution (in Pa) around a circular obstacle. The pressure is obtained from the

bubble area from Eq. (2); more precisely, we report here the diﬀerence between the local pressure

and an average one corresponding to the average bubble area A0.

directions parallel and perpendicular to the ﬂow, and the Uxy component indicates the de-

viation of the deformation from the x and y directions. These combinations are plotted in

Fig. 13 along the ﬁve axis of Fig. 7. First, the trace has a weak amplitude (its absolute

value remains lower than 0.1), and its evolution is strongly anti-correlated to the pressure

(Fig. 11). The explanation of such a trend is easy: when the pressure increases, the bubble

area decreases as explained in Section II C 1. Hence, the length of the vectors ~r linking

centers of neighboring bubbles decreases, and so does Uxx + Uyy

ln r/r0 after Eq. (3).

≈

Second, we consider the parameter Uxx

Uyy. It tends towards a negative value far from the

obstacle, which conﬁrms the spanwise stretch observed on Fig. 12. This trend is observed

both upstream and downstream, hence we think that it is due to the longitudinal pressure

gradient due to the pressure drop along the channel. More interestingly, the presence of the

obstacle strongly modiﬁes the deformation of the bubbles: considering the downstream axis

(x = 2.4 cm), the bubbles are stretched streamwise in the wake, and spanwise on the sides

on the wake, the transition occurring at

= 1.5 cm. On the other hand, on the upstream

axis (x =

2.4 cm) the bubbles are stretched spanwise close to the symmetry axis of the

−

ﬂow, and streamwise on the sides, the transition occurring at

= 2 cm. Third, the Uxy

y

|

|

component on the sides of the obstacle (
|

y

|

= 2.5 cm) changes sign at two diﬀerent points

(x = 0 and 2 cm), showing that the orientation of the maximal deformation rotates of about
180◦ during the passage around the obstacle. Note also that this component is not strictly

reversed between upstream and downstream (comparison of the axis x =

2.4 and y = 2.4

4. Velocity gradients

We now turn to the velocity gradients. We ﬁrst show the map of the deformation rate

in Fig. 14. It conﬁrms that the 2D eﬀective compressibility of the ﬂow (see Section II C 1)

remains weak, because the absolute values maximal elongation and the maximal compression

are very close at any point. Furthermore, the amplitude of the deformation rate decreases

quickly with the distance to the obstacle, and seems to become negligible upstream and

downstream for a distance comparable with the obstacle diameter. To investigate whether

this amplitude really vanishes at a ﬁnite distance from the obstacle, as expected for a

Bingham plastic in the same ﬂow conditions ([37]), we consider the (scalar) dissipation

of the obstacle, but does not vanish. It is possible that it vanishes indeed farther from the

more complex than a power-law or exponential decrease, and is quicker downstream than

upstream.

The map of the vorticity is presented in Fig. 16. The vorticity exhibits signiﬁcant

variations, antisymmetric with respect to the y = 0 axis:

in the y > 0 half-channel, it is

negative on the side of the obstacle, and positive downstream (there is also a little positive

zone just before the obstacle). The asymmetry up/downstream is once more obvious, as

5. T1 quantiﬁcation

We ﬁrst investigate the validity of our measurements of T1s. As explained in Section

II B 2, the calculation of appearing and disappearing edges is decoupled; therefore, we have

to check whether the number of these two kinds of events is the same, as should be if

we record correctly the T1s. Furthermore, we have emphasized that our method may be

sensitive to artifacts. We have calculated the following quantity:

(f+ + f−)i = 7.0%,

which quantiﬁes the relative uncertainty of our method, acceptable despite the various

sources of errors.

We now represent the map of T1s in Fig. 17, which illustrates the advantages of the

tensorial representation: not only does it contain the number of T1s (proportional to the

size of the ellipses, as discussed in Section II B 2), but also their direction. The major axes of

the two kinds of ellipses are mainly orthogonal, which illustrates the fact that plastic events

release high stresses in one direction to the perpendicular direction ([38]). Quantitatively,

Fig. 17 shows that T1s are concentrated close to the obstacle, but again with a signiﬁcant

asymmetry: upstream, the T1s are more distributed and spread widely on the sides on the

obstacle, whereas downstream they are more localised in the wake. Note also that the

direction of T1s is correlated to the ones of the statistical elastic strain (Fig. 12) and of the

deformation rate (ﬁg. 14); such a correlation is probably important to understand better

the rheology of foams.

downstream, at an angular position

complex angular dependence of the T1 frequency is illustrated on Fig. 20. It shows that the
oﬀ-centered downstream maximum arises for an angle θ = 145◦, and that frequency of T1s

is almost equal for this maximum and for the one located in the wake. Fig. 20 shows also a
secondary maximum for θ = 55◦.

C.

Inﬂuence of various control parameters

In this section, we systematically study the dependence of the ﬁelds describing the ﬂow of

foams around obstacles in the same spirit as in [16]: starting from the reference experiment

extensively studied in the previous section, we vary only one control parameter, successively

the ﬂow rate (Section III C 1), the bubble area (Section III C 2), the foam thickness (Section

III C 3) and the bulk viscosity (Section III C 4). To simplify the discussion, we only study

the evolution of three scalar quantities: the velocity component vx, the pressure P and the

quantity Uxx

Uyy, along the axis of symmetry y = 0. We end this section by discussing

−

frequency of T1s. Note the attenuation of the artifacts in comparison with the Fig. 17, as well as

the marked asymmetry up/downstream. The circle indicates the position chosen for the evaluation

of Fig. 20.

1. Flow rate

the inﬂuence of the size and shape of the obstacle (Section III C 5).

At given bubble area (16.0 mm2), foam thickness (3.5 mm) and bulk viscosity (1.06 mm2
s−1), we study ﬁve diﬀerent ﬂow rates: 24, 54, 176, 293 and 515 ml min−1 (corresponding
velocities v0: 0.11, 0.26, 0.84, 1.40 and 2.45 cm s−1). To compare more easily the velocities,

we consider the dimensionless velocity vx/v0. We plot this quantity, as well as the pressure

and the component Uxx

Uyy, along the axis y = 0, in Fig. 21. Remarkably, all data points

−

collapse on the same master curve for the velocity, the pressure and the bubble deformation,

which proves that the qualitative features emphasized in Section III B do not change on the

studied range of ﬂow rate.

2. Bubble area

To study the inﬂuence of bubble area, the ﬂow rate cannot be strictly imposed, since it

is slaved to target values of the other control parameters. However, as shown in Section

III C 1, it has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the results. We study for each bubble area: 12.1,

16.0, 20.0, 25.7, 31.7 and 39.3 mm2, a ﬂow rate as close as possible to the one of the reference
case, respectively 160, 176, 166, 133, 150 and 169 ml min−1. The results are reported in

Fig. 22. They show that neither the velocity ﬁeld nor the bubble deformation depends

qualitatively on the bubble area. Only the pressure behavior in the wake changes: for big

enough bubbles, the pressure release at the trailing side observed in Fig. 11 arises farther,

and can be preceded by a compression zone close to the obstacle.

3. Foam thickness

Various theoretical ([27, 40]) and experimental ([35, 36, 41, 44]) studies have shown that

the ﬂuid fraction plays a crucial role in the foam rheology, but its inﬂuence on the local

behavior of the foam has so far not been studied in detail. In our case, the foam thickness

is a way to change the ﬂuid fraction of the foam: the thicker, the drier the foam. We study

six diﬀerent foam thicknesses: 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 mm, at ﬁxed bubble area 16.0

mm2. The corresponding ﬂuid fractions are 8.5, 7.7, 7.4, 6.7, 6.4 and 5.8% (see [42] for the

evaluation of these ﬂuid fractions). Since the cross section of the foam varies proportionally

the six thicknesses. Velocity, pressure and bubble deformation are plotted in Fig. 23. We

observe the following variations for the lowest foam thicknesses (or highest ﬂuid fractions):

the asymmetry in the velocity is weaker, there appears a compression zone in the wake close

to the obstacle (like for the biggest bubbles studied in Section III C 2), and the amplitude of

the bubble deformation decreases. Note that there is no signiﬁcant variations for the three

highest thicknesses.

4. Bulk viscosity

We investigate now the inﬂuence of bulk viscosity. From the various cases studied in [16],

we only consider the two extremes ones: a soap solution without added glycerol (viscosity:
1.06 mm2 s−1), and another one with 50% added glycerol in mass (viscosity: 9.3 mm2 s−1).
The bubble area is 20.0 mm2. The ﬂow rates are 166 and 154 ml min−1 for the low and high

viscosity cases. The results are presented on Fig. 24. They show that the bulk viscosity has

no signiﬁcant eﬀect, except in the wake close to the obstacle.

To summarize this study of the inﬂuence of the following control parameters: ﬂow rate,

bubble area, foam thickness and bulk viscosity, we emphasize that the main trends shown

in a reference case (Section III B) are robust, especially the up/downstream asymmetry.

5. Obstacle

The last control parameter that we have studied is the obstacle itself. We have shown

in previous studies that tuning the obstacle geometry allows to show a variety of behaviors:

streamlining for a symmetric airfoil proﬁle ([16]) and anti-inertial lift for a cambered one

31

([18]), and combination of drag, lift and torque for an elliptical obstacle ([19]). Here, we focus

on simpler, circular shapes, and compare the reference obstacle, the circle of diameter 30

mm, to a bigger circle, of diameter 48 mm, and a cogwheel of diameter 43.5 mm with cogs of

diameter 4 mm. The other control parameters are the same that the reference experiments:
foam thickness of 3.5 mm, bulk viscosity of 1.06 mm2 s−1 and bubble area of 16.0 mm2.

This area is suitable for bubbles to be trapped into the cogs of the cogwheel, deﬁning an

eﬀective circular obstacle constituted by the cogwheel and the trapped bubbles, of diameter

47.5 mm, comparable to the big circle. In this paragraph, we thus study the inﬂuence of the

size and of the boundary of the obstacle. These obstacles sharing the circular symmetry,

we choose to study them in polar coordinates, plotting the component vr and

vθ of the

velocity, the pressure, and the deviatoric component of the statistical elastic strain tensor

Urr

Uθθ, as functions of θ along a circle located at 1.5 cm from the obstacle boundary (Fig.

−

25).

The data for the big circle and the cogwheel are very similar, showing that the boundary

conditions have little inﬂuence on the behavior of the foam. The comparison between the

two circles show that whereas the radial component of the velocity is almost equal, the

amplitude of the orthoradial component is bigger for the bigger circle. This is actually a

consequence of the constriction between the obstacles and the channel walls: more precisely,
at the angle θ = 90◦, we have

vθ/v0 = vy/v0 = 1.83 for the circle of diameter 48 mm, and

−

vθ/v0 = 1.41 for the circle of diameter 30 mm, which is comparable to the aspect ratio

D), with h = 10 cm the channel width and D the obstacle diameter: this ratio equals

−
h/(h

−

1.92 and 1.43 for these two circles. Moreover, whereas the amplitude of variation of the

pressure is weaker for the small circle, the statistical elastic strain component Urr

Uθθ does

not change much between the three obstacles. It is negative and almost constant for angles
between 100 and 180◦ (Fig. 25), which corresponds actually to an extended region where

the yield strain is reached; the component Urr
Uθθ has a markedly diﬀerent behavior for
angles between 0 and 100◦, where it follows a monotonic, almost linear evolution, which is

−

the signature of an elastic-like transition to another yielded region, situated in the wake of

the obstacle. This is conﬁrmed by the polar dependence of the frequency of T1s (Fig. 20),
which shows a high frequency in the yielded regions for angles close to 0◦ and comprised
between 100 and 180◦, whereas the frequency of T1s is lower in between. A simple sketch of

this behavior, with a yielded region on the whole leading side of the obstacle and an elastic

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Liquid foam: localization or continuity?

Our analysis of Section III A, showing that the ﬂuctuations are like a white noise, suggests

that the foam behaves as a continuous medium. We do not measure large-scale correlations

of plastic rearrangements. This is to compare to ﬂows involving pure shear, like experiments

in Couette geometry ([13, 33, 39]). In this case, a disordered and wet foam in a Hele-Shaw

cell exhibits a strong discontinuity in the form of a localised shear band ([13]), resulting

from large-scale avalanches of T1 ([25]), but a disordered and wet bubble raft shows no such

bands ([34]). This suggests that the friction between the foam and the boundaries alters the

continuity of any quasi-2D foam. Indeed, a recent study has shown that at given ﬂow rate in

the same Couette geometry, liquid pool foams exhibit localization contrary to bubble rafts

([49]).

However, our liquid pool foam does not exhibit localisation. Actually, the ﬂow around an

obstacle is more complex than a pure shear and screens the correlations of T1s, even though

we have very ordered foams. Qualitatively, we only saw large-scale correlations with very

wet and ordered foams, where dislocations between rows of bubbles can occur on distances

of several centimeters. In the experiments presented here, it only occurs for the smallest

foam thickness.

1. Velocity

B. Discussion of the reference experiment

A salient feature of the ﬂow of foam around an obstacle is the asymmetry up/downstream

of the velocity ﬁeld. Such an asymmetry is not captured by the models of Bingham plastics

([37, 43]) or Herschel-Bulkley ﬂuids ([4]) usually invoked to simply model liquid foams. It

is an elastic eﬀect, and the velocity overshoot in the wake of the obstacle (Fig. 9) has

already been reported (and termed negative wake) for a number of other elastic ﬂuids (see

e.g.

[20, 29]). However, a more quantitative comparison to other viscoelastic ﬂuids is

diﬃcult, because of the boundary conditions: for a viscoelastic ﬂuid, there is no slip against

a solid boundary, whereas at the macroscopic scale, the foam slips against the walls and the

34

obstacle (Fig. 8). More precisely, a high velocity gradient is concentrated in the thin liquid

ﬁlm between the solid boundaries and the neighboring bubbles.

2. Pressure

We showed that the pressure in maximal at the upstream side of the obstacle, and minimal

at the downstream side (Section III B 2), and that it does not depend signiﬁcantly on the

ﬂow rate (Section III C 1). This suggests that the pressure is mainly of elastic origin, which

is also corroborated by the anti-inertial lift observed for an airfoil ([18]). More precisely,

ﬁtting the data for the pressure along the axis y = 0 (Fig. 21) by a power-law yields the
0.7)x−1.13±0.05 (expressed in Pa). The exponent is close

following dependence: P (x) = (9.5

±

to

1, which is coherent with the stress distribution is an elastic medium under a point-like

−

force ([30]).

3. Coupling between statistical elastic strain, velocity gradients and T1s

The asymmetric repartition of the T1s (Fig. 19) is a major result of this study, since the

plastic ﬂow of the foam results from the superposition of many T1s. Since T1s more likely

occur for deformed bubbles, it is interesting to compare their repartition with the map of

statistical elastic strain (Fig. 12). Such a comparison reveals that the regions of frequent T1s

indeed correspond to high deformation, but the correlation is not so simple: for instance,

upstream from the obstacle, the deformation is maximal at x = 0 (Fig. 13), whereas the T1s

occur more likely on the sides of the obstacle, not at x = 0 (Fig. 20). This occurs because

in this region, the velocity gradients acts to increase the preexistent deformation (Fig. 14).

There is thus a strong coupling between the statistical elastic strain, the velocity gradients

and the T1 repartition, which is analysed in more detail elsewhere ([Marmottant et al.]).

C.

Inﬂuence of the control parameters and comparison with force measurements

We now compare qualitatively our results to the force measurements realized in the same

conditions in [16]. To summarize, this study showed that the drag exerted by a ﬂowing foam

35

on a circular obstacle scales as:

F = F0 + cste

η0.77v0,

×

(4)

with η the bulk viscosity, and F0 a decreasing function of the bubble area. The independence

of the pressure and the bubble deformation on the ﬂow rate is in qualitative agreement with

the linear increase of the force exerted by the ﬂowing foam on the obstacle ([16]), if we

assume that the velocity-dependent contribution to the force is mainly due to the viscous

friction in the liquid ﬁlms between the obstacle and the surrounding bubbles. Moreover,

the exponent for the bulk viscosity in (4) is close to 1, which is compatible with the weak

inﬂuence of this parameter (Fig. 24). Concerning the foam thickness, Fig. 23 shows that the

up/downstream diﬀerences increases with the foam thickness, hence decreases with the ﬂuid

fraction. This is compatible with the decrease of the drag with the ﬂuid fraction reported

in [42]. The role of the bubble area is more complex: we showed in Section III C 2 that this

parameter does not inﬂuence much the bubble deformation, but that the up/downstream

diﬀerence in pressure decreases with increasing bubble area. The bubble deformation and

pressure being the two contributions to the yield drag F0 in (4), this qualitatively agrees

with the fact that F0 decreases with the bubble area. However, we do not understand yet

why the behavior of the pressure and deformation diﬀers so markedly. The last studied

control parameter, the obstacle itself, shows that the boundary conditions at the obstacle

plays no signiﬁcant role. The size of the obstacle has two inﬂuences: the bigger the circle,

the higher the velocity at its sides, due to the imposed constriction, and the higher the

amplitude of variation of the pressure. This is compatible with the measured values of the

drag coeﬃcient (ratio of drag and obstacle radius) reported in [16] for these three obstacles,

equal for the cogwheel and the big circle, and slightly lower for the small circle.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We performed a systematic local description of the ﬂow of foam around a circular obsta-

cles, quantifying the elasticity by the statistical elastic strain tensor and the pressure ﬁeld,

the plasticity by a tensorial descriptor of bubble rearrangements, and the ﬂow by the velocity

ﬁeld and its gradients. We demonstrate in Section III A that such a continuous approach is

justiﬁed and suitable in this case. The study of a reference experiment (Section III B) shows

36

a marked asymmetry up/downstream: the velocity exhibits an overshoot in the wake, and

the bubble rearrangements spread more at the leading side than in the wake of the obstacle.

This reveals the complex behavior of the foam, dictated by the coupling between elasticity

(bubble deformations), plasticity (bubble rearrangements) and ﬂow (velocity gradients).

We showed in Section III C 1 that the rescaled velocity ~v/v0, the pressure and the bubble

deformation do not depend signiﬁcantly on the ﬂow rate, in the studied range. Hence,

the yield and the dynamic contributions in foam rheology seem to be decoupled, which

justiﬁes recent approaches to model foam ﬂows (and more generally, complex ﬂuid ﬂows)

as Bingham plastics with an added elastic term independent of the shear rate ([47, 51]).

However, such scalar approaches are not suﬃcient in our context, where the complex ﬂow

around an obstacle appeals for a tensorial description. It would be interesting to perform the

same experiments at higher ﬂow rate, to determine when this decoupling between elastic and

dynamic contribution breaks down, and to investigate whether phenomena such as elastic

turbulence ([21]) could then occur in the wake of the obstacle.

The detailed results shown in Section III, combined with the associated force measure-

ments reported in [16], severely constrain the rheological models adapted to describe liquid

foams. The foam ﬂowing around an obstacle intrinsically exhibits yield stress and dissipa-

tion (yield drag on the obstacle ([12, 16])), and elastic stress (up/downstream asymmetry);

all these eﬀects can only be captured by a whole elastoviscoplatic model.

For the ﬁrst time weak turbulent theory was demonstrated for the surface gravity waves. Direct numerical
simulation of the dynamical equations shows Kolmogorov turbulent spectra as predicted by analytical analysis
[1] from kinetic equation.

PACS: 47.11.+j, 47.27.-i, 47.27.Eq, 92.10.Hm

In this Letter we study numerically the steady
Kolmogorov spectra for spatially homogeneous gravity
waves. According to the theory of weak turbulence
the main physical process here is the stationary en-
ergy ﬂow to the small scales, where the energy dissi-
pates [1, 2]. This ﬂow is described by kinetic equation
which has power-like solutions – Kolmogorov spectra.
This straightforward picture takes place experimentally
and numerically for diﬀerent physical situations. For
capillary waves it was observed on the surface of liq-
uid hydrogen [3], [4]. The numerical simulation of this
process was performed in [5]. In nonlinear ﬁber optics
these spectra were demonstrated in numerical simula-
tion [6].There are many other results [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
One of the most interesting applications of the weak
turbulence theory is the surface gravity waves. From
the pioneering article by Toba [12] to the most recent
observations [13] many experimentalists get the spectra
predicted by the weak turbulence theory. But these ex-
periments cannot be treated as a complete conﬁrmation
because the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum is isotropic,
while observed spectra are essentially anisotropic. It is
worth to say that the wave kinetic equation, which is
the keystone of this theory, was derived under several
assumptions. Namely, it was assumed, that the phases
of all interacting waves are random and are in state of
chaotic motion. The validity of this proposition is not
clear a priori. The direct numerical simulation of non-
linear dynamical equations can give us a conﬁrmation
is this assumption valid or not. But for particular case
of gravity surface waves the numerical conﬁrmation was
absent in spite of signiﬁcant eﬀorts were applied. The
only successful attempt in this direction was the sim-
ulation of freely decaying waves [14]. The reason for
that for our opinion was concerned with a choice of
numerical scheme parameters. Namely, the numerical

1)e-mail: kao@landau.ac.ru

simulation is very sensitive to the width of resonance
of four-waves interaction.
It must be wide enough to
provide resonance on the discrete grid, as it was studied
in [15] for decay of the monochromatic capillary wave.
From the other hand it has to be not too wide (due to
nonlinear frequency shift) when the weak turbulent con-
ditions fail. We have spent signiﬁcant eﬀorts to secure
the right choice of numerical parameters. As a result we
have obtained the ﬁrst evidence of the weak turbulent
Kolmogorov spectrum for energy ﬂow for surface grav-
ity waves. The numerical simulation was surprisingly
time consuming (in comparison to capillary waves tur-
bulence), but ﬁnally we clearly get spectrum for surface
elevation

Theoretical background. — Let us consider the po-
tential ﬂow of an ideal incompressible ﬂuid of inﬁnite
depth and with a free surface. We use standard nota-
tions for velocity potential φ(r, z, t), r = (x, y); v =
φ
and surface elevation η(r, t). Fluid ﬂow is irrotational
φ = 0. The total energy of the system can be repre-

where ψ = φ(r, η(r, t), t) is a velocity potential on the
surface of the ﬂuid. In order to calculate the value of
ψ we have to solve the Laplas equation in the domain
with varying surface η. This problem is diﬃcult. One
can simplify the situation, using the expansion of the
Hamiltonian in powers of ”steepness”

For gravity waves it is enough to take into account terms
up to the fourth order. Here ˆk is the linear operator

The dispersion relation (10) is of the ”non-decay type”

It means that in the limit of
small nonlinearity, the cubic terms in the Hamiltonian
can be excluded by a proper canonical transformation
a(k, t)
b(k, t) [18]. The formula of this transforma-
tion is rather bulky and well known [17, 18], so let us
omit the details here.

For numerical integration of (6) we used the func-

The complete form of matrix element Tk,k1,k2,k3 can be
found in many sources [1, 2, 17]. Function fp(k) in (17)
corresponds to wave pumping due to wind blow for ex-
ample. Usually it is located on long scales. Function
fd(k) represents the absorption of waves due to viscos-
ity and wave-breaking. None of this functions are known
to a suﬃcient degree.

mogorov spectrum, describing inverse cascade of wave
action to large scales, and Q is a ﬂux of action. In both
cases C1 and C2 are dimensionless ”Kolmogorov’s con-
stants”.

Numerical Simulation — Dynamical equations (6)
are very hard for analytical analysis. One of the main
obstacles is the ˆk-operator which is nonlocal. However,
using Fourier technique practically makes no diﬀerence
between derivative and ˆk. The numerical simulation of
the system is based upon consequent application of fast
Fourier transform algorithm. The details of this numer-
ical scheme will be published separately.

Here Rk(t) is the uniformly distributed random num-

equations (6) in the periodic domain 2π
2π (the wave-
numbers kx and ky are integers in this case). The size
of the grid was chosen 256
256 points. Gravity accel-

eration g = 1. Parameters of the damping and pumping
were the following: kp1 = 5, kp2 = 10, kd = 64. Thus
the inertial interval is about half of decade.

×

During the simulations we paid special attention
to the problems which could ”damage” the calcula-
tions. First of all, the ”bottle neck” phenomenon at the
boundary between inertial interval and dissipation re-
gion. This eﬀect is very fast, but can be eﬀectively sup-
pressed by proper choice of damping value γ2 in the case
of moderate pumping values F0. The second problem is
the accumulation of ”condensate” in low wave numbers.
This mechanism for the case of capillary waves was ex-
amined in details in [15]. This obstacle can be over-
come by simple adaptive damping scheme in the small
wave numbers. After some time system reaches the sta-
tionary state, where the equilibrium between pumping
and damping takes place. Important parameter in this
state is the ratio of nonlinear energy to the linear one
(H1 + H2)/H0.

10−4, γ1 =
For example, in the case of F0 = 2
10−3, γ2 = 400 the level of nonlinearity was equal
10−3. The Hamiltonian as a

The surface elevation correlator function appears to
be power-like in the essential part of inertial interval,
where the inﬂuence of pumping and damping was small.
The correlator is shown in Fig. 2.

One can try to estimate the exponent of the spec-
trum. It is worth to say that an alternative spectrum
was proposed earlier by Phillips [20]. That power-like
spectrum is due to wave breaking mechanism and gives
k−4. Compen-
us a surface elevation correlator as Ik ∼
sated spectra are shown in the Fig. 3. It seems to be
an evidence, that the Kolmogorov spectrum predicted
by weak turbulence theory better ﬁt the results of the
numerical experiment.

The inertial

interval was rather narrow (half a
decade). But the obtained results allow us to conclude,
that accuracy of experiment was good enough under the
time constraints of simulation (we get the steady state
after 20-30 h using available hardware, and we need sev-
2 function). The simulation on
eral days to average
larger grid (512
512, for example) can make the ac-
curacy better. But even these results give us a clear
qualitative picture.

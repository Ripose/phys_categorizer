PACS 91.25.Cw – Origins and models of the magnetic ﬁeld; dynamo theories
PACS 47.65.+a – Magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics

Abstract. - We report the ﬁrst experimental observation of reversals of a dynamo ﬁeld generated
in a laboratory experiment based on a turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium. The magnetic ﬁeld ran-
domly switches between two symmetric solutions B and −B. We observe a hierarchy of time scales
similar to the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld: the duration of the steady phases is widely distributed, but
is always much longer than the time needed to switch polarity. In addition to reversals we report
excursions. Both coincide with minima of the mechanical power driving the ﬂow. Small changes
in the ﬂow driving parameters also reveal a large variety of dynamo regimes.

Dynamo action is the instability mechanism by which
mechanical energy is partially converted into magnetic en-
ergy by the motion of an electrically conducting ﬂuid [1].
It is believed to be at the origin of the magnetic ﬁelds
of planets and most astrophysical objects. One of the
most striking features of the Earth’s dynamo, revealed by
paleomagnetic studies [2], is the observation of irregular
reversals of the polarity of its dipole ﬁeld. This behaviour
is allowed from the constitutive equations of magnetohy-
drodynamics [1] and has been observed in numerical mod-
els [3]. On the other hand, industrial dynamos routinely
generate currents and magnetic ﬁelds from mechanical mo-
tions. In these devices, pioneered by Siemens [4], the path
of the electrical currents and the geometry of the (solid)
rotors are completely prescribed. As it cannot be the
case for planets and stars, experiments aimed at studying
dynamos in the laboratory have evolved towards relax-
ing these constraints. Solid rotor experiments [5] showed
that a dynamo state could be reached with prescribed mo-
tions but currents free to self-organize. A landmark was
reached in 2000, when the experiments in Riga [6] and
Karlsruhe [7] showed that ﬂuid dynamos could be gener-
ated by organizing favourable sodium ﬂows, the electrical
currents being again free to self-organize. For these exper-
iments, the self-sustained dynamo ﬁelds had simple time
dynamics (a steady ﬁeld in Karlsruhe and an oscillatory

ﬁeld in Riga). No further dynamical evolution was ob-
served. The search for more complex dynamics, such as
exhibited by natural objects, has motivated most teams
working on the dynamo problem to design experiments
with less constrained ﬂows and a higher level of turbu-
lence [8]. The von K´arm´an sodium experiment (VKS) is
one of them. It has recently shown regimes where a sta-
tistically stationary dynamo self-generates [9]. We report
here the existence of other dynamical regimes and describe
below the occurence of irregular reversals and excursions.

Magnetic induction properties of turbulent swirling
ﬂows (VKS and others) have been widely studied ex-
perimentally [8, 10]. Dynamo action by these ﬂows has
also received strong support from numerical simula-
tions [11, 12]. The VKS experimental set-up, shown
in Figure 1, has been described in [9]. The ﬂuid is
liquid sodium, chosen for its high electrical conductivity

(σ = 107 ohm

parameter space accessible when the ﬂow is driven with
disks rotating at diﬀerent speeds. As said above, only sta-
tistically stationary dynamos are observed in the counter-
rotating case (Figure 2b). Another statistically stationary
dynamo mode is observed when the frequency of one im-
peller is increased from zero (say F1), the other being kept
ﬁxed at 22 Hz, thus Rm2 in the range 42−43 depending on
the sodium temperature (Figure 2c). Note however that
its relative ﬂuctuations are much smaller (compare Fig-
ures 2b, c), an eﬀect possibly ascribed to global rotation.
This regime undergoes secondary bifurcations when the
slower impeller frequency is increased further. In a small
parameter range, ∆Fi/Fi ≈ 20%, a variety of dynamical
regimes, oscillations, intermittent bursts (not shown), as
well as dynamos with random reversals (Figure 3) are ob-
served. We also ﬁnd pockets of parameters for which we
could not record the growth of a dynamo during 3-minute

Fig. 1: The VKS2 set-up is designed to generate a dynamo
ﬂow in an electrically conducting ﬂuid. The overall vessel is
a copper cylinder of radius 289 mm and length 604 mm. The
ﬂow itself is conﬁned within an inner copper cylinder (radius
R = 206 mm, length 524 mm, thickness 5 mm), with sodium at
rest between the inner and outer cylinders. An annulus of inner
radius 175 mm (thickness 5 mm) is ﬁxed along the inner cylin-
der in the mid-plane between the disks. The counter-rotating
iron impellers have radius 154.5 mm and are set 371 mm apart
in the inner vessel; they are ﬁtted with 8 curved blades of height
h = 41.2 mm. Their rotation frequencies are independently ad-
justable, up to 26 Hz. Magnetic measurements are made using
a temperature controlled, 3D Hall probe mounted ﬂush on the
ﬂow boundary, at the inner cylinder.

temperatures between 110◦C and 160◦C. The integral
Reynolds numbers are deﬁned as Rei = 2πKR2Fi/ν and
take values up to 5 106 where ν is the ﬂuid viscosity and
K = 0.6 is a coeﬃcient that measures the eﬃciency of the
driving impellers [12]. Corresponding magnetic Reynolds
numbers, Rmi = 2πKµ0σR2Fi, up to 49 at 120◦C are
reached – µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum.
The magnetic ﬁeld is measured with local Hall probes
inserted inside the ﬂuid.

When the impellers are operated at equal and opposite
rotation rates F , a fully turbulent dynamo is observed
when F is larger than about 17 Hz (Rm = 31) [9]. The
self-sustained magnetic ﬁeld is statistically stationary with
either polarity in this case. In the experiment, the rota-
tion rates (F1, F2) of the driving impellers can be inde-
pendently adjusted and this gives an additional degree of
freedom. Starting from a symmetric ﬂow forcing, F1 = F2,
one can progressively change the rotation frequency of one
disk and explore regimes in which the faster disk imposes
some kind of global rotation to the ﬂow, a feature common
to most natural dynamos.

We show in Figure 2 a preliminary inspection of the

Fig. 3: Magnetic ﬁeld measured inside the ﬂow vessel, by a 3-dimensional Hall probe. No external magnetic ﬁeld is applied,
other than the ambient ﬁeld, whose amplitude is about 0.2 gauss across the measurement volume.The temperature of the outer
copper cylinder is T = 123 oC. (Main): Time evolution of all three magnetic ﬁeld components. The main component (red) is
the azimuthal one. Note that all components decay to zero at a reversal. The bottom graph shows synchronous recordings of
the power driving the ﬂow. (Right): detail of the time series of the main magnetic ﬁeld and simultaneous power consumption

long runs –corresponding to over 3000 forcing time scales.
We now describe reversals of the magnetic ﬁeld. In Fig-
ure 3, we show a time series that corresponds to F1 =
16 Hz and F2 = 22 Hz. In this regime, the magnetic ﬁeld
reverses at irregular time intervals. All three components
of the dynamo ﬁeld switch polarity in perfect synchrony,
so that B changes to −B. For each polarity, the amplitude
of the magnetic ﬁeld has strong ﬂuctuations, with an rms
ﬂuctuation level of the order of 20% of the mean. This
level of ﬂuctuations is due to the very intense turbulence
of the ﬂow, as the kinetic Reynolds number exceeds 106.
Reversals occur randomly and have been followed for up
to 45 minutes, i.e. 54000 characteristic time scales of the
ﬂow forcing.

In the regime reported in Figure 3, the polarities do not
have the same probability of observation. Phases with
a positive polarity for the largest magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nent have on average longer duration (hT+i = 120 s) than
phases with the opposite polarity (hT−i = 50 s). This
asymmetry can be due to the ambient magnetic ﬁeld. Note

however that the amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld, that is
much larger than the Earth ﬁeld, is the same for both po-
larities. Standard deviations are of the same order of mag-
nitude as the mean values, although better statistics may
be needed to fully converge these estimates. The mean
duration of each reversal, τ ∼ 5 s, is longer than magne-
tohydrodynamics time scales: the ﬂow integral time scale
is of the order of the inverse of the rotation frequencies,
i.e. 0.05 s, and the ohmic diﬀusive time scale is roughly
τη ∼ 0.4 s. Concerning the dynamics of ﬁeld reversals, a
natural question is related to the connection between B
and −B in time. The equations of magnetohydrodynam-
ics are symmetric under the transformation B to −B so
that the selection of a polarity is a broken symmetry at the
dynamo bifurcation threshold. The sequences of opposite
polarities act as magnetic domains along the time axis,
with Ising-type walls in-between them: the magnetic ﬁeld
vanishes during the polarity change rather than rotating
as in a Bloch-type wall.

One important discovery in these measurements is that

reversals of magnetic ﬁeld are correlated with the global
energy budget of the ﬂow. The total power P (t) deliv-
ered by the motors driving the ﬂow ﬂuctuates in time in
a strongly asymmetric manner: the record shows short
periods when P is much smaller than its average. They
always coincide with large variations in the magnetic ﬁeld,
as shown in Figure 3. Either a reversal occurs, or the mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬁrst decays and then grows again with its direc-
tion unchanged. Similar sequences, called excursions [2],
are observed in recordings of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
The variation of power consumption during the weaken-
ing of the magnetic ﬁeld is in agreement with the power
required to sustain a steady dynamo in the VKS2 experi-
ment [9] (drops by over 20%, that is 20 kW out of 90 kW).
However, we note that in other regions of the parameter
space, diﬀerent regimes also involve changes in polarity
without noticeable modiﬁcation of power.

We have also observed that the trajectories connecting
the symmetric states B and −B are quite robust despite
the strong turbulent ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow. This is
the time evolution of reversals
displayed in Figure 4:
from down to up states can be neatly superimposed by
shifting the origin of time such that B(t = 0) = 0 for
each reversal. Despite the asymmetry due to the Earth
magnetic ﬁeld, up-down reversals can be superimposed in
a similar way on down-up ones if −B is plotted instead
of B. For each reversal the amplitude of the ﬁeld ﬁrst
decays exponentially. A decay rate of roughly 0.8 s−1 is
obtained with a log-lin plot (not shown). After changing
polarity, the ﬁeld amplitude increases linearly and then
displays an overshoot before reaching its statistically
stationary state.

to up polarity. For each of them the origin of time has been
shifted such that it corresponds to B = 0.

Further investigation of this regime will help address
from an experimental perspective persistent questions
about magnetic ﬁeld reversals. Some of these concern
the role of hydrodynamics and electromagnetic boundary

conditions – both of them can be experimentally adjusted.
Others are related to the dynamics of the magnetic re-
versals. From inspection of paleomagnetic data, it has
been proposed that reversing dynamos and non-reversing
ones are metastable states in close proximity [13].
In
geodynamo simulations (convective dynamos in rapidly
rotating spheres), the ﬂow is often laminar and reversals
have been associated to interaction between dipole and
higher order modes, with the possibility of reversal
precursor events [14]. Fields reversals have also been
observed in turbulence driven numerical α2 and αω dy-
namos based on mean-ﬁeld magnetohydrodynamics [15].
In these, the role of noise was found to be essential,
together with the proximity of steady and oscillating
states.
In many cases, the existence of several dynamo
regimes in a narrow region of parameter space has been
considered as essential. Our experiment displays this
feature: two diﬀerent stationary dynamo modes bifurcate
for F1 = F2 and respectively F1 6= F2. Their interaction
gives rise to a variety of diﬀerent dynamical regimes in
parameter space. This is a general feature for bifurcations
of multiple codimension. The most striking aspect of our
observation is that the low dimensional dynamics that
result from the interaction of a few modes of the magnetic
ﬁeld is preserved despite strong ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow
that generates the ﬁeld. On average, the largest scales of
the ﬂow change more than a thousand times during each
phase of given polarity. The large scale magnetic ﬁeld
cannot follow turbulent ﬂuctuations and display features
characteristic of
low dimensional dynamical systems.
Flows generating the magnetic ﬁelds of planets or stars
involve dimensionless parameters (Reynolds and Eckman
numbers) orders of magnitudes diﬀerent from the ones
of the present experiment and even further in the case
of numerical simulations. However, a weak coupling
between the large scale dynamics of their magnetic
ﬁeld and hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations may explain why
similar features are observed in some natural dynamos,
in numerical modeling and in this experiment.

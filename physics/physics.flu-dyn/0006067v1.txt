Radial Viscous Flow between Two Parallel Annular

1 Problem

Deduce the velocity distribution of steady ﬂow of an incompressible ﬂuid of density ρ and
viscosity η between two parallel, coaxial annular plates of inner radii r1, outer radii r2 and
separation h when pressure diﬀerence ∆P is applied between the inner and outer radii.

As an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equation appears to be diﬃcult, it suﬃces to
give an approximate solution assuming that the velocity is purely radial, v = v(r, z)ˆr, in
a cylindrical coordinate system (r, φ, z) whose z axis coincides with that of the two annuli.
Deduce a condition for validity of the approximation.

This problem arises, for example, in considerations of a rotary joint between two sections
of a pipe. Here, we ignore the extra complication of the eﬀect of the rotation of one of the
annuli on the ﬂuid ﬂow.

2 Solution

For an incompressible ﬂuid, the velocity distribution obeys the continuity equation

∇ · v = 0,

in which case the Navier-Stokes equation for steady, viscous ﬂow is

ρ(v · ∇)v = −∇P + η∇2v.

(1)

(2)

There are only three examples in which analytic solutions to this equation have been obtained
when the nonlinear term (v · ∇)v is nonvanishing [1].

We ﬁrst review the simpler case of two-dimensional ﬂow between parallel plates in sec. 2.1,
and then take up the case of radial ﬂow in sec. 2.2. We will ﬁnd an analytic solution to the
nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation (2) for radial ﬂow, but this solution cannot satisfy the the
boundary conditions,

v(z = 0) = 0 = v(z = h),

(3)

that the ﬂow velocity vanish next to the plates. However, in the linear approximation to
eq. (2) we obtain an analytic form for the radial ﬂow between two annular plates.

2.1 Two-Dimensional Flow between Parallel Plates

For guidance, we recall that an analytic solution is readily obtained for the related problem
of two-dimensional viscous ﬂow between two parallel plates. For example, suppose that the
plates are at the planes z = 0 and z = h, and that the ﬂow is in the x direction, i.e.,

1

v = v(x, z)ˆx. The equation of continuity (1) then tells us that ∂v/∂x = 0, so that the
velocity is a function of z only,

v = v(z)ˆx.

(4)

The z component of the Navier-Stokes equation (2) reduces to ∂P/∂z = 0, so that the
pressure is a function of x only. The x component of eq. (2) is

∂P (x)

∂x

= η

∂2v(z)

∂z2

.

(5)

Since the lefthand side is a function of x, and the righthand side is a function of z, equation
(5) can be satisﬁed only if both sides are constant. Supposing that the pressure decreases
with increasing x, we write

−

∂x

> 0.

Using the boundary conditions (3), we quickly ﬁnd that

v(z) =

2.2 Radial Flow between Parallel Annular Plates

Returning to the problem of radial ﬂow between two annular plates, we seek a solution
in which the velocity is purely radial, v = v(r, z)ˆr. The continuity equation (1) for this
hypothesis tells us that

so that

∂(rv)

∂r

= 0,

v =

f (z)

ˆr.

(9)

(10)

Following the example of two-dimensional ﬂow between parallel plates, we expect a parabolic
proﬁle in z as in eq. (7),

f (z) ∝ z(h − z),

(11)

which satisﬁes the boundary conditions (3).

Using the trial solution (10), the z component of the Navier-Stokes equation (2) again
tells us that the pressure must be independent of z: P = P (r). The radial component of
eq. (2) yields the nonlinear form

ηr2 d2f

dz2 + ρf 2 = r3 dP

dr

.

(12)

The hoped-for separation of this equation can only be achieved if f (z) = F is constant,
which requires the pressure proﬁle to be P (r) = A − ρF 2/2r2. The boundary conditions (3)
cannot be satisﬁed by this solution. Further, this solution exists only for the case that the
pressure is increasing with increasing radius. The ﬂuid ﬂow must be then be inward, so the
constant F must be negative. The Navier-Stokes equation is not time-reversal invariant due
to the dissipation of energy associated with the viscosity, and so reversing the velocity of a
solution does not, in general, lead to another solution.

While we have obtained an analytic solution to the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation (2),
it is not a solution to the problem of radial ﬂow between two annuli. It is hard to imagine a
physical problem involving steady, radially inward ﬂow of a long tube of ﬂuid, to which the
solution could apply.

Instead of an exact solution, we are led to seek an approximate solution in which the
nonlinear term f 2 of eq. (12) can be ignored. In this case, the diﬀerential equation takes the
separable form

d2f
dz2 =

r
η

dP
dr

= constant.

(13)

Following eq. (7) we write the solution for f that satisﬁes the boundary conditions (3) as

f (z) = 6 ¯f

z

h (cid:18)1 −

z

h(cid:19) ,

(14)

where ¯f is the average of f (z) over the interval 0 ≤ z ≤ h. The part of eq. (13) that describes
the pressure leads to the solution

P (r) =

P1 ln r2/r + P2 ln r/r1

ln r2/r1

,

where Pi = P (ri). Plugging the solutions (14) and (15) back into eq. (13), we ﬁnd that

¯f =

h2∆P

12η ln r2/r1

,

where ∆P = P1 − P2. Hence, the ﬂow velocity is

v(r, z) =

z(h − z)∆P
2ηr ln r2/r1

ˆr,

(15)

(16)

(17)

whose average with respect to z is ¯v(r) = ¯f/r. As with all solutions to the linearized
Navier-Stokes equation, the velocity is independent of the density.

For the approximate solution (17) to be valid, the term f 2 ≈ ¯f 2 must be small in eq. (12),

which requires

ρh4∆P

144η2r2

1 ln r2/r1

≪ 1.

(18)

When this condition is not satisﬁed, the solution must include velocity components in the
z direction that are signiﬁcant near the inner and outer radii, while the ﬂow pattern at
intermediate radii could be reasonably well described by eq. (17).

If one of the annuli is rotating at angular velocity ω, the radial ﬂow velocity should still

be given approximately by eq. (17) so long as ωr2 <∼ ¯v(r2) = ¯f /r2.

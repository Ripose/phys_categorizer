It is known that in a certain case, the secondary Bjerknes force, which is a radiation force acting
between pulsating bubbles, changes (e.g., from attractive to repulsive) as the bubbles approach each
other. In this letter, a theoretical discussion of this phenomenon is given. The present theory, based
on analysis of the eigenfrequencies of interacting bubbles, gives an accurate interpretation, which
diﬀers from previous ones (e.g., by Doinikov and Zavtrak [Phys. Fluids 7, 1923-1930 (1995)]), of
the phenomenon. It is shown, for example, that the ﬁrst reversal, occurring when both bubbles
are larger than the resonance size and the damping eﬀect is suﬃciently small, is due to the highest
eigenfrequency of the larger bubble.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is known that two gas bubbles pulsating in an acous-
tic ﬁeld experience an interaction force called the sec-
ondary Bjerknes force.1–4 In 1984, Zabolotskaya showed
theoretically that in a certain case, the sign of the force
may change as bubbles come closer to one another.2 She
assumed that the reversal of the sign is due to the varia-
tion in the natural frequencies of the interacting bubbles.
However, the theoretical formula derived for evaluating
the natural frequencies of two interacting bubbles cannot
explain the reversal. The formula is represented as

(ω2

10 − ω2)(ω2

20 − ω2) −

R10R20

D2 ω4 ≈ 0

(1)

where R10 and R20 are the equilibrium radii of bubbles,
ω10 and ω20 are their partial natural frequencies, ω is the
driving frequency of the external sound, and D is the dis-
tance between the centers of the bubbles. This equation
predicts the existence of two natural frequencies, and is
symmetric; namely, it exchanges 10 and 20 on the sub-
scripts of variables to reproduce the same equation. This
means that the two bubbles have the same natural fre-
quencies, and their respective pulsation phases are simul-
taneously inverted (e.g., from in-phase to out-of-phase
with the external sound) at the distance where the (ef-
fective) natural frequencies of the bubbles are equal to
the driving frequency. As a result, the bubbles pulsat-
ing in-phase with each other will sustain in-phase pul-
sation even when the distance between them becomes
suﬃciently small.

In 1995, Doinikov and Zavtrak, using a mathematical
model in which the multiple scattering of sound between
bubbles is taken into account more accurately, predicted
again the reversal of the sign.3 They also asserted that
the reversal is due to the change in the natural frequen-
cies. They assumed that the natural frequencies of both

bubbles increase as the bubbles approach each other, re-
sulting sometimes in the reversal of the sign. When, for
example, both bubbles are larger than the resonance size
and the distance between them is large enough, they pul-
sate in phase. As the bubbles approach each other, the
natural frequency of a smaller bubble may ﬁrst, at a cer-
tain distance, rise above the driving frequency, and, in
turn, the bubbles’ pulsations become antiphase; the force
then changes from attractive to repulsive. On the other
hand, when one bubble is larger and the other is smaller
than the resonance size and the distance between them
is large, they pulsate out of phase and the force is re-
pulsive. As the distance between the bubbles becomes
small, the natural frequencies of both bubbles may rise,
and when the natural frequency of a larger bubble rises
above the driving frequency, the repulsive force may turn
into attraction. Although this interpretation can explain
the reversal, it is in opposition to the prediction given by
Eq. (1), which reveals that the higher natural frequency
(converging to the partial natural frequency of a smaller
bubble for D → ∞)5,6 becomes higher and the lower one
(converging to the partial natural frequency of a larger
bubble for D → ∞) becomes smaller as the bubbles ap-
proach each other.

The aim of this letter is to give an alternative inter-
pretation of the reversal of the sign; one that may be
more accurate than the previous ones. Recently, hav-
ing reexamined Zabolotskaya’s model, in which a sys-
tem of diﬀerential equations for linear coupled oscillators
is employed, we found that a bubble interacting with a
neighboring bubble has three “eigenfrequencies”, deﬁned
as the driving frequencies for which the phase diﬀerence
between an external sound and the pulsation of the bub-
ble becomes π/2 .5,6 Among the three eigenfrequencies,
the lowest one decreases and remaining two increase as
the bubbles approach each other. Only one of them con-
verges to the partial natural frequency of the correspond-
ing bubble for D → ∞. Namely, the eigenfrequencies

1

deﬁned as above are asymmetric. Using this theory for
the eigenfrequencies, we give a novel explanation for the
reversal.

II. THEORIES

In this section, we brieﬂy review previously expounded
theories for deriving the eigenfrequencies and estimating
the magnitude of the secondary Bjerknes force. Let us
assume that the pressure of the external sound, pex, is
written in the form of pex = −Pa sin ωt, and the time-
dependent radii of bubbles 1 and 2, R1 and R2, respec-
tively, can be represented as R1 = R10+e1, R2 = R20+e2
|e2| ≪ R20, where Pa is a positive
and |e1| ≪ R10,
constant, and Rj0 and ej are the equilibrium radius
and the deviation of the radius, respectively, of bubble
j (j = 1, 2). From the linearized system for coupled
oscillators,1,5,6 we can obtain the harmonic steady-state
solution for e1 and e2, expressed as

e1 = K1 sin(ωt − φ1),
e2 = K2 sin(ωt − φ2),

where the concrete expressions for the amplitude K1 and
the phase diﬀerence φ1 are given in Refs. 5 and 6. The
eigenfrequencies of bubble j are determined so that φj
becomes π/2.5,6 The resulting formula for deriving the
eigenfrequencies is

H1F + M2G = 0

where δ1 and δ2 are determined from the damping char-
acteristic of the system (see the following section). The
above formula is for bubble 1; exchanging 1 and 2 in the
subscripts of variables in this equation yields the formula
for bubble 2.

The secondary Bjerknes force acting between the bub-

bles is expressed with1,7

F ∝ K1K2 cos(φ1 − φ2)

r2 − r1
kr2 − r1k

3 ,

where r1 and r2 are the positions of bubbles 1 and 2,
respectively, and kr2 − r1k = D. The reversal of the sign
of this force occurs only when the sign of cos(φ1 − φ2)
changes, because K1 > 0 and K2 > 0 always.5,6

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

First, we discuss the case of R10 = 3 mm and R20 = 6
mm, which corresponds to a case used in Ref. 4. We
assume that the bubbles are ﬁlled with a gas with a con-
stant speciﬁc heat ratio of 1.4, and the surrounding mate-
rial is water. For the damping coeﬃcient, we adopt that
used for radiation loss in Ref. 4 (actually, the thermal
loss should not be neglected in the frequency range used
here; we neglect it, however, in order to simplify the fol-
lowing discussion), and the value for viscous loss was that
employed in our previous paper. Thus, we reset δ1 and
δ2 in Refs. 5 and 6 as δ1 = ω2R10/c and δ2 = ω2R20/c,
where c is the speed of sound in water.

Figures 1(a) and 1(a’) show the natural frequencies of
the bubbles, ω1 and ω2, calculated by using Eq. (2). In
those ﬁgures, l denotes the normalized distance deﬁned as
l = D/(R10+R20). As mentioned previously, three eigen-
frequencies appear in the region where l is small, and only
one eigenfrequency, converging to the partial resonance
frequency of the corresponding bubble, remains when l
is suﬃciently large. The second highest eigenfrequency
of bubble 2 is almost equal to the highest one of bub-
ble 1, and the highest one of bubble 2 is, thus, higher
than that of bubble 1. Figures 1(b), 1(b’), and 1(c) show
C1 = cos(φ1), C2 = cos(φ2), and E = cos(φ1 − φ2), re-
spectively, as functions of l. Here the driving frequency
is assumed to be ω = 1.18 ω10. When l is large, both
bubbles pulsate out-of-phase with the external sound be-
cause ω > ω10 and ω > ω20; thus, both C1 and C2 are
about −1 and the force is attractive (i.e., E > 0). When
l becomes suﬃciently small, C2 ﬁrst turns positive, and
the force consequently changes from attractive to repul-
sive. This result is inconsistent with the interpretation
given in Refs. 3 and 4, both of which claim that the ﬁrst
reversal in this case is due to the rise in the natural fre-
quency of the smaller bubble.

Now let us consider the dependency of the sign of the
force on ω. Figure 2 shows E calculated by using dif-
ferent driving frequencies. For ω = 1.05 ω10, the sign of
the force changes three times. We can see from Fig. 1
that, in this case, the eigenfrequencies of bubbles 1 and
2 become equal to ω once and twice, respectively, during
the approach; this may cause the complicated behavior
of the sign. In the case of ω = 0.95 ω10 (ω < ω10 and
ω > ω20), the sign stays negative through out because
the eigenfrequencies of both bubbles never become equal
to ω. For ω = 0.6 ω10, one reversal from repulsive to at-
tractive is observed. In Refs. 3 and 4, to explain the last
case, it was assumed that the reversal occurs when the
natural frequency of the larger bubble, rising as the bub-
bles approach each other, exceeds the driving frequency.
However, the present result reveals that the reversal in
this case is due to the second highest eigenfrequency of
the smaller bubble. This result cannot be explained by
Zabolotskaya’s theory either [Eq. (1)], given that it as-
sumes that the lower natural frequency decreases.

0.95 ω10, and 0.6 ω10. The curve for ω = 1.18 ω10 is shown
again for convenience of comparison.

Next, we show results for R10 = 20 µm and R20 = 30
µm (this setting is typical of those used in Ref. 3). In this
case, we adapt the thermal loss for the damping factor,
as done in Ref. 3. For computing the polytropic exponent
and the damping coeﬃcient, we employ Devin’s formula
and use parameters the same as those used in Ref. 3. Fig-
ure 3 shows the eigenfrequencies of both bubbles. In this
setting, “subeigenfrequencies” (eigenfrequencies that do
not converge to the partial natural frequency of the cor-
responding bubble) of the larger bubble do not appear;
this may due to a relatively strong damping eﬀect.5,6 Fig-

3

ure 4 shows E as a function of l, given by using diﬀerent
driving frequencies. In contrast with the previous exam-
ple, the reversals in the cases of ω > ω10 and ω > ω20 are
due to the highest and second highest eigenfrequencies of
the smaller bubble. The reversal in the case of ω < ω10
and ω > ω20 (ω = 0.8 ω10) is, as in the previous example,
due to the second highest eigenfrequency of the smaller
bubble.

The results given above can be summarized as follows.
The ﬁrst reversal, occurring when both bubbles are larger
than resonance size, is due to the highest eigenfrequency
of the larger bubble when the damping eﬀect is suﬃ-
ciently small, and to the highest eigenfrequency of the
smaller bubble in other cases. The reversal occurring
when one bubble is larger than and the other bubble is
smaller than the resonance size is, in any case, due to
the second highest eigenfrequency of the smaller bubble.
These results are more complicated than the assumptions
given by Doinikov and Zavtrak.3,4

IV. CONCLUSION

We have discussed the inﬂuence of variations in the
eigenfrequencies of gas bubbles, which result from their
radiative interaction, on the secondary Bjerknes force

acting between pulsating bubbles. The present theory
can explain the reversal of the sign of the force in any
case, and gives results that contradict the interpretations
of the reversal given by Doinikov and Zavtrak.3,4 Our re-
sults show that the theory given in Refs. 5 and 6 for
evaluating the eigenfrequencies of interacting bubbles is
a reasonable tool for accurately understanding the mech-
anism of the reversal. In future work8, the theory will be
extended to systems consisting three or more bubbles,
such as those discussed in Refs. 9–12.

Lastly, we remark further on the results given in Ref. 4.
In that paper, the frequency of the external sound (f =
ω/2π) was assumed to be f = 63 kHz, which is 60 times
higher than the partial resonance frequency of a bubble
of R0 = 3 mm (1.094 kHz); nevertheless, the reversal was
observed. (In Ref. 3, the driving frequency is assumed to
be comparable to the partial natural frequencies of bub-
bles, and the bubble radii are several tens of microme-
ters.) The result reveals implicitly that the mathematical
model proposed in Ref. 4 predicts such a strong increase
of the natural frequencies, which cannot be explained
by the classical model for coupled oscillators used here.
Derivation of the eigenfrequencies of Doinikov and Zav-
trak’s model would be an interesting future subject.

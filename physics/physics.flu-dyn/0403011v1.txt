Abstract

Large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on two-phase immisci-

ble ﬂows show that associated with the moving contact line, there is a very

large 1/x partial-slip region where x denotes the distance from the contact

line. This power-law partial-slip region is veriﬁed in large-scale adaptive con-

tinuum simulations based on a local, continuum hydrodynamic formulation,

which has proved successful in reproducing MD results at the nanoscale. Both

MD and continuum simulations indicate the existence of a universal slip pro-

ﬁle in the Stokes-ﬂow regime, well described by vslip(x)/Vw = 1/(1 + x/als),

where vslip is the slip velocity, Vw the speed of moving wall, ls the slip length,

and a is a numerical constant. Implications for the contact-line dissipation

are discussed.

Boundary condition that speciﬁes the ﬂow of ﬂuid over a solid surface is a cornerstone

of hydrodynamics. The no-slip condition, i.e., zero relative velocity between the ﬂuid and

solid at the interface, has been the paradigm in most of the hydrodynamics literature [1].

In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, however, a small amount of relative slip between

the ﬂuid and the solid surface is generally detected at high ﬂow rate [2]. Such slip can

be accounted for by the Navier boundary condition (NBC), whereby the slip velocity is

proportional to the tangential viscous stress [2,3]. The proportionality constant between

the slip velocity vslip and the shear rate is denoted the slip length ls, usually ranging from

one to a few nanometers (from MD simulations). As the amount of slip is extremely small

in subsonic ﬂow rates, the NBC is practically indistinguishable from the no-slip condition

in most situations. In contrast, for immiscible ﬂows the MD simulations have shown near-

complete slip in the vicinity of the moving contact line (MCL), deﬁned as the intersection of

ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface with the solid wall [4–6]. An intriguing question ensues: In a mesoscopic

or macroscopic system, what is the slip proﬁle which consistently interpolates between the

near complete slip at the MCL and the no-slip boundary condition that must hold at regions

far away [7,8]? Recent evidences have shown the slip proﬁle obtained from nanoscale MD

simulations to be accountable by the generalized Navier boundary condition (GNBC), in

which the slip velocity is proportional to the total tangential stress — the sum of the

viscous stress and the uncompensated Young stress; the latter arises from the deviation of

the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface from its static conﬁguration [6]. Here we show through large-scale

MD simulations and continuum hydrodynamic calculations, that there exists a power-law

partial-slip region extending to hundreds of nanometers or even more, contrary to the usual

expectation of a nanometer-scale slip region in the vicinity of the MCL. The existence of

this large partial-slip region modiﬁes the conventional picture that signiﬁcant NBC slipping

occurs only under high ﬂow/shear rate. Instead, the power-law slip region is associated with

the universal slip proﬁle of the MCL, even at low ﬂow rates.

MD simulations have been carried out for increasingly larger systems of immiscible

Couette ﬂow (Fig. 1). Two immiscible ﬂuids were conﬁned between two parallel walls

in the xy plane, with the ﬂuid-solid boundaries deﬁned by z = 0, H. Periodic bound-

ary conditions were imposed along the x and y directions.

two [001] planes of an fcc lattice, with each wall molecule attached to a lattice site by a

harmonic spring. The mass of the wall molecule was set equal to that of the ﬂuid molecule

m. The number density of the wall was set at ρw = 1.86/σ3. The wall-ﬂuid interaction

was modeled by another LJ potential Uwf with the energy and range parameters given by

ǫwf = 1.16ǫ and σwf = 1.04σ, and δwf for specifying the wetting property of the ﬂuid, taken

to be 1 in our simulations. The Couette ﬂow was generated by moving the top and bottom

The tangential slip velocity proﬁles next to the wall, i.e., the slip proﬁles, are shown in

the inset to Fig. 2. While there is clearly a small core region, on the order of a few ls,

where the slip proﬁles display sharp decay, a much more gentle variation of the slip proﬁles

becomes apparent as the system size H increases. In order to quantify the nature of the

gentle variation, we plot in Fig. 2 the same data in the log-log scale. The dashed line has

a slope

1, indicating the 1/x behavior to be indeed realized in MD simulations. For our

−

ﬁnite-sized systems, there is always a plateau in the slip velocity in each of the single-phase

ﬂows, also observable in MD simulations with a value given by vslip

0 = 2Vwls/(H + 2ls),

which acts as an outer cutoﬀ on the 1/x proﬁle. This vslip

expression is simply derived

from the Navier-Stokes equation for uniform shear ﬂow and the NBC. From our largest MD

simulation, the vslip

1/x behavior is seen to extend to

50σ (or

25ls). Hence as

approaches 0 (no-slip), the power-law region can be very large indeed.

A large 1/x partial slip region is signiﬁcant, because the outer cutoﬀ length scale directly

determines the integrated eﬀects, such as the total steady-state dissipation. While in the

past the 1/x stress variation away from the MCL has been known [9], to our knowledge the

fact that the partial slip also exhibits the same spatial dependence has not been previously

seen [10], even though the validity of the Navier boundary condition at high shear stress has

been veriﬁed [2,3].

Since MD simulations reach size and accuracy (e.g., for Vw/

a continuum hydrodynamic formulation is necessary for realistic simulations. In particular,

continuum simulations are necessary for low ﬂow rate immiscible ﬂows, where MD simula-

tions are known to be very resource intensive. Combining the GNBC with the Cahn-Hilliard

(CH) hydrodynamic formulation of two-phase ﬂow [11,12], we have obtained a continuum

hydrodynamic model [6], suitable for the calculation of much larger immiscible ﬂows (than

MD simulations) that are accurate to the molecular scale. In the same notations of Ref. [6],

the continuum model is formulated as follows. The two coupled equations of motion are the

Navier-Stokes (NS) equation (with the addition of the capillary force density) and the CH

convection-diﬀusion equation for the composition ﬁeld φ(r) = (ρ2

ρ1)/(ρ2 + ρ1) (where ρ1

The continuum results shown in Fig. 2 were calculated on a uniform mesh, using the

same set of material parameters and M, Γ values corresponding to the same local properties

in all the ﬁve MD simulations. The overall agreement is excellent. Such agreement is possible

because the GNBC does not impose an artiﬁcial cutoﬀ on the slip region. Below we extend

the MCL simulations, through continuum hydrodynamics, to lower ﬂow rates and much

The continuum simulation for macroscopic immiscible ﬂows is a challenging task. Meth-

ods based on a ﬁxed uniform mesh would break down because it cannot aﬀord to simulate

macroscopic systems with molecular resolution near the MCL. We have employed for this

problem the adaptive method based on iterative grid redistribution [14]. The computa-

tional mesh is redistributed according to the behavior of the continuum solution so that ﬁne

molecular resolution is achieved in the interfacial region and near the MCL, while elsewhere

a much coarser mesh is used to save computational cost. The mesh distribution is controlled

by a monitor function (see [14]), and the redistribution procedure is done repeatedly as the

solution evolves to its steady state. A semi-implicit time stepping scheme is also used to

speed up the approach to steady state. For Couette ﬂow, since the interface and contact

line are conﬁned in a region that is narrow in the x direction but extended in the entire z

direction, we used a variable, adaptive grid in the x direction and kept a uniform grid in the

z direction. This relatively simpler grid structure (compared to a general two dimensional

5

variable grid) greatly simpliﬁes the space discretization as well as the matrix structure in

the implicit time discretization.

Figure 3 shows the continuum results for three large systems (H on the order of hundreds

of σ) with small Vw (

0.001

ǫ/m, well beyond the accuracy of our MD simulations). In

all three cases, the capillary force was veriﬁed to be important only in the interfacial region.

In fact it decays to zero (exponentially) within a few σ. However, the pressure gradients

and viscous forces shows a much slower variation. They are balanced outside the interfacial

region, indicating the ﬂow to be governed by the Stokes equation. This is expected, because

of vx/Vw plotted as a function of x/ls.

(The inset of Fig. 2 has already shown part of

the universality, that the core slip proﬁle is independent of the system size H.) We give a

heuristic account of the universal slip proﬁle as follows. Away from the MCL, the viscous

As the external work done in the steady state must be fully dissipated, the total dissipation

rate is equal to the rate of external work.

Slip proﬁles obtained from both MD and continuum simulations show that the 1/x

The lower limit for R can reach submicrometer or even shorter length scales. On the other

hand, there have been increasing evidences for large slip length realized in various ﬂuid-solid

interfaces [16–18]. Slip length ls as large as 1 µm has been reported [17,18]. The results

7

in this paper indicate that ﬂuid-solid interfacial dissipation is an important contribution to

the total dissipation if large slip length occurs in a small system. While asymptotic analysis

has shown that at large distances from the MCL, the ﬂow ﬁeld is not sensitive to the slip

boundary condition [19], yet the (macroscopic) asymptotic region may not be attained given

the small system size and/or the large slip length. In this regard, a continuum hydrodynamic

formulation of the contact-line motion is necessary for realistic simulations of ﬂuid dynamics

at micro- and nanoscales, as done in the present case.

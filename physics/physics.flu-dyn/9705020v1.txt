Abstract

A problem of great concern in aviation and submarine propulsion
is the control of the boundary layer and, in particular, the methods
to extend the laminar region as a means to decrease noise and fuel
consumption.
In this paper we study the ﬂow of air along an air-
foil when a layer of ionized gas and a longitudinal electric ﬁeld are
created in the boundary layer region. By deriving scaling solutions
and more accurate numerical solutions we discuss the possibility of
achieving signiﬁcant boundary layer control for realistic physical pa-
rameters. Practical design formulas and criteria are obtained. We also
discuss the perspectives for active control of the laminar-to-turbulent
transition ﬂuctuations by electromagnetic ﬁeld modulation.

1 Boundary layers and boundary layer con-

trol

Whether a ﬂow is laminar or turbulent, the eﬀects of the viscosity of the
ﬂuid are greatest in regions close to solid boundaries. The region close to

1

the boundary, in which the velocity varies from zero, relative to the surface,
up to its full value, is called the boundary layer. The concept of boundary
layer introduced by Prandtl in 1904, was a most signiﬁcant advance in ﬂuid
dynamics, in the sense that it simpliﬁed the study by separating the ﬂow in
two parts: (1) the region where velocity gradients are large enough to produce
appreciable viscous forces - the boundary layer itself - and (2) the external
region where viscous forces are negligible compared to other forces. From
the computational point of view the concept of boundary layer also plays
a signiﬁcant role because, rather than having to deal with time-consuming
general purpose ﬁnite-element codes, results of comparable precision may be
obtained by fast and relatively simple ﬁnite-diﬀerence implicit algorithms.

When a ﬂuid ﬂows past a solid body, an airfoil for example, a laminar
boundary layer develops, in general only for a very small distance near the
leading edge, followed by a transition to a turbulent boundary layer. Never-
theless, because near the solid wall velocity ﬂuctuations must die out, below
the turbulent region there always is a laminar sub-layer which in general is
very small (of the order of a micrometer). The transition from the laminar
to the turbulent region is controlled by the local Reynolds number, deﬁned
in terms of the eﬀective thickness of the boundary layer. It also depends on
the smoothness of the surface and on the external perturbations. The skin
friction drag is proportional to the gradient of the longitudinal velocity at
the solid boundary. Because of the mixing properties of the turbulent layer,
the gradient in the laminar sub-layer is much greater than the gradient at a
fully laminar layer. Therefore transition from a laminar to a turbulent layer
greatly increases the skin friction drag. Another eﬀect to be taken into ac-
count is the separation of the boundary layer, which occurs at points where
the pressure gradient along the surface reverses sign. The eddies, generated
by the resulting reverse ﬂow, disturb the ﬂow and form a wake where energy
dissipation decreases the pressure, thereby increasing the pressure drag.

Because of the very large ratio between laminar and turbulent skin fric-
tion drag, much eﬀort has been devoted to develop techniques to delay the
transition as a means of decreasing fuel consumption and noise. Care should
however be taken because, in general, a turbulent boundary layer is more
stable towards separation than a laminar boundary layer. Some of the active
control techniques that have been proposed include suction of slow-moving
ﬂuid through slots or a porous surface, use of compliant walls and wall cool-
ing (or wall heating for liquids). Injection of fast-moving ﬂuid, on the other

2

hand, is eﬀective in avoiding separation but it increases turbulence. Most of
these ideas are fairly old (see for example [1],[2]) however, in view of their
interest for the applications and to obtain a more accurate characterization
of the physical mechanisms, studies of boundary layer control using these
aerodynamic methods are still, at present, being vigorously pursued (see for
example [3] [4] [5] [6] and papers in [7])

Another class of techniques for active boundary layer control consists in
acting on the ﬂow by means of electromagnetic forces. Here diﬀerent tech-
niques should be envisaged according to whether the ﬂuid is weakly conduct-
ing (an electrolyte like seawater or an ionized gas) or a good conductor (like a
liquid metal). Proposals for boundary layer control by electromagnetic forces
are also relatively old and trace its origin at least to the papers of Gailitis
and Lielausis[8], Tsinober and Shtern[9] and Moﬀat[10] in the sixties. Inter-
est in these techniques has revived in recent years and some more accurate
calculations and experimental veriﬁcations have been carried out, mostly in
the context of electrolyte ﬂuids[11] [12].

In this paper we will be concerned with the ﬂow of air along an airfoil
when a layer of ionized gas is created on the boundary layer region. Local
ionization of the air along the airfoil is not practical from the technological
point of view, therefore we will assume that a stream of ionized air (or some
other ionized gas) is injected through a backwards facing slot placed slightly
behind the stagnation point (Fig.1). The body force that we consider to
be acting in the ionized ﬂuid is a longitudinal (along the ﬂow) electric ﬁeld
created by a series of plate electrodes transversal to the ﬂow and placed inside
the airfoil with the edges on the airfoil surface.

The emphasis of our study is on ﬁnding physically reasonable ranges of
parameters and analytic approximations that might lead to simple designing
procedures. For this purpose, before the numerical calculation of Section
3, we dedicate some time to the study of scaling solutions and analytical
approximations.

The provisional conclusions of our study are that it is possible to use
this technique to control the proﬁle of the boundary layer laminar region.
With the rates of ionization that are needed and the injection method, it
is probably unrealistic to expect that the laminar region may be extended
over all the airfoil in normal (aviation) working conditions. Therefore this
method should be used in conjunction with methods for control of turbulent
boundary layers (riblets, large-eddy breakups, additives, etc.) in the rear part

3

of the airfoil. Also the injection of the stream of ionized gas in the leading
edge may, by increasing the velocity component normal to the airfoil, create
turbulence. Therefore it seems advisable to have a compensating suction
region after the injection slot. The ionization rate will also improve if the
gas extracted through the suction region is recycled through the ionizer.

Notice also that, once the ﬂuid in the boundary layer is ionized, large
scale velocity ﬂuctuations may be detected by a few local probes. This raises
the possibility of obtaining a negative feedback eﬀect by an appropriate time-
dependent modulation of the electric ﬁeld. By controlling the growth of the
velocity ﬂuctuation in the transition region, a further extension of the laminar
region may be obtained. This is brieﬂy discussed in the last section of the
paper.

The overall conclusion is that, when used in conjunction with other tech-
niques, as explained above, the method of boundary layer control by electric
ﬁelds might be interesting from the fuel consumption point of view. This
study was carried out as a preparation for an experiment being set up in our
Mechatronics Laboratory.

2.2 Scaling solutions

We assume that the electric ﬁeld to be created by a series of plate electrodes
along the z-direction, that is transversal to the ﬂuid ﬂow. For this electrode
geometry the mean electric ﬁeld in the x-direction may be parametrized by

Ex = g(x)

l(x)
l2(x) + y2

where x and y are the adimensional coordinates deﬁned in (4). E0 = g(x)
l(x)
is the ﬁeld at y = 0, controlled by the potential diﬀerences between the
electrodes, and l(x) is of the order of the electrode spacing. For thin (laminar)
boundary layers the ﬁeld Ex may with good approximation be considered to
be independent of y throughout the boundary layer thickness, as long as the
appropriate charge density proﬁle is chosen (see below).

For the main application we are addressing, ionized air would be injected
through a slot near the leading edge of the airfoil, being then carried along
the airfoil surface by the ﬂow. The steady-state charge distribution in the
boundary layer is obtained from the continuity equation

ψ being the stream function deﬁned before. Then, for a column of ionized air
injected at a backwards facing angle through a slot placed at x0, behind the
stagnation point, each point acts as a point source of intensity proportional
to the local ﬂuid velocity. Furthermore the intensity of the eﬀective source

is depleted up the column. Taking the depletion eﬀect into account, one
obtains by integration of Eq.(20)

σ(x, y) = σ0 (1

σ0 is the injection intensity and d1 characterizes the rate of depletion. The
conclusion is that the charge density is maximum at the airfoil surface, de-
creasing to zero at a distance that depends on the ﬂuid dynamics and the
injection regime.
In numerical simulations one may easily use the fairly
accurate equation (21) for the charge density proﬁle. Here however, the
dynamically-dependent charge density proﬁle will be parametrized by the
simpler formula

Gailitis and Lielausis[8] have also obtained a theoretical solution of con-
stant thickness. However they consider a diﬀerent force ﬁeld distribution and
no dependence of the ﬂuid charge density on the boundary layer dynamics.
Therefore their boundary layer proﬁle has a very diﬀerent behavior.

Fig. 2). Fig.3 shows the eﬀective boundary layer thickness as a function of
a. The eﬀective boundary layer thickness δ∗ is deﬁned here as the value of η
at which the velocity u reaches 0.95 of its asymptotic value ue. A very fast
thinning of the boundary layer is obtained (several orders of magnitude) for
a relatively short range of the a parameter. Fig.3 shows the variation of δ∗
for small a. For large a (and small δ∗) one has the asymptotic formula

which is obtained from Eq.(31).

If the longitudinal electric ﬁeld Ex is assumed to be a constant (E0)
throughout the boundary layer thickness, with the same charge proﬁle, the
solution is even simpler, namely

with ξ = √c2 and

constant thickness boundary layer.

that the WKB expression (31) is a good approximation for physically inter-

density estimate is obtained both in the constant-ﬁeld and the variable-ﬁeld
cases, shows that it is realistic to consider the ﬁeld as approximately con-
stant throughout the laminar boundary layer thickness, as long as a variable

the solution F .

The integration now proceeds along the lines, from left to right. After a
complete pass the process is restarted using now for the calculation of the
coeﬃcients Aj, Bj, Dj and Gj the old values of F at (i + 1, j). The process
is repeated several times until the solution stabilizes.

In the second method, which is the one we actually use, the integration
process starts from an approximate solution. The scaling solutions derived
in Sect.2 are particularly useful for this purpose.

For our calculations we considered an electric ﬁeld parametrized as in

Eq.(18), namely

ω = 666.66 which corresponds to l = 10, ue = 1 and νω = 0.15.
Notice that for these parameters, as pointed out in Sect.2, the electric ﬁeld
has only a small variation throughout the boundary layer region. For the
scaling function we take ξ(x) = √x and consider β = 1. Then all results
depend only on the variable S

good check of the numerical algorithm. A clear indication of the results in
Fig.5 is that not much improvement is obtained unless one is able to obtain
ionization charge densities of the order of the reference value σr.

4 Discussion and conclusions

# In this paper we have concentrated on controlling the proﬁle of the bound-
ary layer. The proﬁle has a direct eﬀect on the laminar or turbulent nature
of the ﬂow which, in a simpliﬁed manner, we estimated by a local Reynolds
number (37) deﬁned as a function of the eﬀective thickness. Another relevant
aspect, of course, is the active control of the transition instabilities that can
be achieved by electromagnetic body forces on the charged ﬂuid.

Turbulence and transition to turbulence are three-dimensional phenom-
ena. However, for the large scale small amplitude (Tollmien-Schlichting)

The conclusion is that a space-time modulation of the electric ﬁeld, with
the appropriate phase, is equivalent to an eﬀective viscous damping eﬀect
which delays the growth of the transition region instability. For this to be
eﬀective one needs to detect the phase of the wave instabilities by electromag-
netic probes. Absolute synchronization of the feedback electric modulation
is however not so critical as in acoustic noise cancelation, because here the
objective is only to obtain an eﬀective damping eﬀect. The simpliﬁed treat-
ment of the transition instabilities is justiﬁed by the fact that it is only for
the small amplitude large scale ﬂuctuations that one may hope to be able to
detect the phase with some reasonable accuracy.

# The kinematic reference parameters deﬁned in (34) correspond to typ-
ical aviation conditions. The conclusion, both from the scaling solutions in
Sect.2 and the numerical results in Sect.3, is that, to obtain a signiﬁcant
controlling eﬀect on the boundary layer by this method, the charge den-
sity σ0 (at y = 0) should be of the order of the reference charge density
3). This charge density corresponds to about 50 times the
(σr = 15µC cm−
ion concentration a few centimeters away from the emitter of a commercial
table-top negative corona discharge air puriﬁer with a power of less than 6
watts. Therefore, it seems technically feasible to achieve a signiﬁcant bound-
ary layer control by this method. Another possibility would be to use, instead
of air, some other easier to ionize gas. This could then be partially recovered
and recycled by suction.

# As explained in the introduction and because of the perturbation in-
duced by the injection method, it seems advisable to use this method in
conjunction with suction and passive control in the rear part of the airfoil.
Even if a fully laminar boundary layer may never be completely achieved,
just remember that any small improvement becomes, in the long run, quite
signiﬁcant in terms of fuel consumption.

# The formula (38), derived from the scaling solutions, provides rough
design estimates. Better control over design parameters we hope to obtain
from the experimental work.

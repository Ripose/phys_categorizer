Spectral direct numerical simulations of incompressible MHD turbulence at a resolution of up to
10243 collocation points are presented for a statistically isotropic system as well as for a setup with
an imposed strong mean magnetic ﬁeld. The spectra of residual energy, ER

energy, Ek = EK
⊥ , Ek⊥ ∼ k−3/2
Ek ∼ k−5/3 (isotropic case) and ER
(anisotropic case, perpendicular to the
mean ﬁeld direction). A model of dynamic equilibrium between kinetic and magnetic energy, based
on the corresponding evolution equations of the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM)
closure approximation, explains the ﬁndings. The assumed interplay of turbulent dynamo and
Alfv´en eﬀect yields ER
k which is conﬁrmed by the simulations.

The nonlinear behavior of turbulent plasmas gives rise
to a variety of dynamical eﬀects such as self-organization
of magnetic conﬁnement conﬁgurations in laboratory ex-
periments [1], generation of stellar magnetic ﬁelds [2] or
structure formation in the interstellar medium [3]. The
understanding of these phenomena is incomplete as the
same is true for many inherent properties of the under-
lying turbulence.

Large-scale low-frequency plasma turbulence is treated
in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation de-
scribing the medium as a viscous and electrically resis-
tive magnetoﬂuid neglecting additional kinetic eﬀects.
Incompressiblity of the ﬂow is assumed for the sake of
simplicity.
In this setting the nature of the turbulent
energy cascade is a central and still debated issue with
diﬀerent phenomenologies being proposed [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
(cf. [9] for a review). The associated spectral dynamics
of kinetic and magnetic energy, in spite of its comparable
importance, has received less attention (as an exception
see [10]).

k | and Ek = EK

This Letter reports a spectral relation between residual

and total energy, ER

respectively, as well as the inﬂuence of an imposed mean
magnetic ﬁeld on the spectra. The proposed physical pic-
ture, which is conﬁrmed by accompanying direct numer-
ical simulations, embraces two-dimensional MHD tur-
bulence, globally isotropic three-dimensional systems as
well as turbulence permeated by a strong mean magnetic
ﬁeld.

In the following reference is made to two high-
resolution pseudospectral direct numerical simulations
of incompressible MHD turbulence which we regard as
paradigms for isotropic (I) and anisotropic (II) MHD tur-
bulence. The dimensionless MHD equations

∂tω = ∇ × [v × ω − b × (∇ × b)] + µ∆ω
∂tb = ∇ × (v × b) + η∆b

∇ · v = ∇ · b = 0 .

are solved in a 2π-periodic cube with spherical mode
truncation to reduce numerical aliasing errors [11]. The
equations include the ﬂow vorticity, ω = ∇ × v, the mag-
netic ﬁeld expressed in Alfv´en speed units, b, as well as
dimensionless viscosity, µ, and resistivity, η. In simula-
tion II forcing is applied by freezing the largest spatial
scales of velocity and magnetic ﬁeld.

Simulation I evolves globally isotropic freely decaying
turbulence represented by 10243 Fourier modes. The ini-
tial ﬁelds are smooth with random phases and ﬂuctuation
amplitudes following exp(−k2/(2k2
0)) with k0 = 4. To-
tal kinetic and magnetic energy are initially equal with
EK = EM = 0.5. The ratio EK/EM decreases in time
taking on values of 0.28 − 0.23 in the period consid-
ered (cf.
[12]). The ratio of kinetic and magnetic en-
ergy dissipation rate, εK/εM , with µ = η = 1 × 10−4
also decreases during turbulence decay from 0.7 to about
0.6, the diﬀerence in dissipation rates reﬂecting the im-
balance of the related energies. The Reynolds number
Re= (EK)E/(µεtotal) at t = 6 is about 2700 and slightly
diminishes during the run. Magnetic, H M = 1
V dVa·b,

b = ∇ × a, and cross helicity, H C = 1

negligible with H C showing a dynamically unimportant
increase from 0.03 to 0.07 during the simulation. The
run covers 9 eddy turnover times deﬁned as the time re-
quired to reach the maximum of dissipation from t = 0.
The large-scale rms magnetic ﬁeld decays from initially
0.7 to 0.3.

Case II is a 10242 × 256 forced turbulence simula-
tion with an imposed constant mean magnetic ﬁeld of
strength b0 = 5 in units of the large-scale rms magnetic
ﬁeld brms ≃ vrms ≃ 1. The forcing, which keeps the ratio
of ﬂuctuations to mean ﬁeld approximately constant, is
implemented by freezing modes with k ≤ kf = 2. The
simulation with µ = η = 9 × 10−5 has been brought into
quasi-equilibrium over 20 eddy-turnover times at a res-
olution of 5122 × 256 and spans about 5 eddy turnover
times of quasi-stationary turbulence with 10242 × 256

as the ratio EK/EM are approximately unity with a

large-scale magnetic ﬂuctuations with brms ≃ 0.4 are ob-
served. Correspondingly, εK/εM ≃ 0.95 during the sim-
ulation. The system has relaxed to H C ≃ 0.15 with a

Fourier-space-angle integrated spectra of total, mag-
netic, and kinetic energy for case I are shown in Fig. 1.
To neutralize secular changes as a consequence of turbu-
lence decay, amplitude normalization is used assuming
a Kolmogorov total energy spectrum, Ek → Ek/(εµ5),
ε = −∂tE, with wavenumbers given in inverse multi-
ples of the associated dissipation length, ℓD ∼ (µ3/ε)1/4.
The quasi-stationary normalized spectra are time aver-
aged over the period of self-similar decay, t = 6 − 8.9.
As in previous numerical work [13, 14] and also observed
in solar wind measurements [15, 16], Kolmogorov scaling
applies for the total energy in the well-developed iner-
tial range, 0.01 . k . 0.1. However, here the remark-
able growth of excess magnetic energy with decreasing
wavenumber is of interest. Qualitatively similar behavior
is observed with large scale forcing exerted on the system.
We note that no pile-up of energy is seen at the dissipa-
tive fall-oﬀ contrary to other high-resolution simulations
[14, 17]. Apart from diﬀerent numerical techniques and
physical models this diﬀerence might be due to the lim-
ited simulation period at highest resolution namely 5 [14]
and 4.3 [17] large-eddy-turnover times. Depending on ini-
tial conditions the energy spectrum at 10243-resolution
is still transient at that time.

In case II, pictured in Fig. 2, strong anisotropy is
generated due to turbulence depletion along the mean

magnetic ﬁeld, b0, (cf. also [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]). This
is visible when comparing the normalized and time-
averaged ﬁeld-perpendicular one-dimensional spectrum,
Ek⊥ =
dk1dk2E(k⊥, k1, k2) (solid line) with the ﬁeld-
parallel spectrum, deﬁned correspondingly and adum-
brated by the dash-dotted line in Fig. 2. The ﬁxed k⊥-
axis is chosen arbitrarily in the k1-k2-plane perpendicu-
lar to b0 where ﬂuctuations are nearly isotropic. For the
strong b0 chosen here, ﬁeld-parallel and -perpendicular
energy spectra do not diﬀer notably from the ones found
by considering the direction of the local magnetic ﬁeld as
done e.g. in [18, 23]. The ﬁeld-parallel dissipation length
is larger than in ﬁeld-perpendicular directions because of
the stiﬀness of magnetic ﬁeld lines. The numerical reso-
lution in the parallel direction can, therefore, be reduced.

While there is no discernible inertial range in the par-
allel spectrum, its perpendicular counterpart exhibits an
−3/2
interval with Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scaling, Ek⊥ ∼ k
⊥
(Note that due to identical energy scales in Figs.
1
and 2 the absolute diﬀerence between Kolmogorov and
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scaling is the same as in Fig.1).
This is in contradiction to the anisotropic cascade phe-
nomenology of Goldreich and Sridhar for strong turbu-
−5/3
[7] and with numerical
lence predicting Ek⊥ ∼ k
⊥
studies claiming to support the GS picture [23, 24]. How-
ever, the strength of b0 in these simulations is of the or-
der of the turbulent ﬂuctuations and consequently much
weaker than for the anisotropic system considered here.
We note that indication for ﬁeld-perpendicular IK scaling
has been obtained in earlier simulations at lower resolu-
tion using a high-order hyperviscosity and with a stronger

mean component, b0/b ∼ 3 × 102 [25]. The authors of the
aforementioned paper, however, are unsure whether they
observe a numerical artefact or physical behavior.

The strongly disparate spectral extent of ﬁeld-parallel
and -perpendicular ﬂuctuations suggests that Alfv´en
waves propagating along the mean ﬁeld do not have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the perpendicular energy spec-
trum (in the sense of Goldreich-Sridhar, cf. also [21]).
Instead, the strong b0 constrains turbulence to quasi-two-
dimensional ﬁeld-perpendicular planes as is well known
and has been shown for this particular system [18].

Another intriguing feature of system II is that EK
k ≃
EM
k with only slight dominance of EM (cf. Fig. 2) in
contrast to the growing excess of spectral magnetic en-
ergy with increasing spatial scale for case I. Since both
states are dynamically stable against externally imposed
perturbations (as has been veriﬁed numerically), they
presumably represent equilibria between two compet-
ing nonlinear processes: ﬁeld-line deformation by tur-
bulent motions on the spectrally local time scale τNL ∼
ℓ/vℓ ∼
leading to magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁca-
tion (turbulent small-scale dynamo) and energy equipar-
tition by shear Alfv´en waves with the characteristic time
τA ∼ ℓ/b0 ∼ (kb0)−1 (Alfv´en eﬀect). The conjecture
can be veriﬁed via the EDQNM closure approximation
[26] which yields evolution equations for kinetic and mag-
netic energy spectra [27] by including a phenomenological
eddy-damping term for third-order moments. The spec-
tral evolution equation for the signed[32] residual energy,
ER = EM − EK, in the case of negligible cross helicity
reads [28]:

The geometric coeﬃcients mkpq, rkpq, skpq, tkpq, a con-
sequence of the solenoidality constraints (3), are given in
[28]. The ‘△’ restricts integration to wave vectors k, p,
q which form a triangle, i.e. to a domain in the p-q plane
which is deﬁned by q = |p + k|. The time Θkpq is char-
acteristic of the eddy damping of the nonlinear energy
ﬂux involving wave numbers k, p, and q.
It is deﬁned
phenomenologically but its particular form does not play
a role in the following arguments.

Local triad interactions with k ∼ p ∼ q are dominating
the hydrodynamic turbulent energy cascade and lead to
Kolmogorov scaling of the associated spectrum (cf., for
example, [29]). In contrast, the nonlinear interaction of
Alfv´en waves includes non-local triads with, e.g., k ≪
p ∼ q. In this case a simpliﬁed version of equation (4)

It is now assumed that the right hand side of (4) can
be written as T R
Dyn [10]. This states that the resid-
ual energy is a result of a dynamic equilibrium between
turbulent dynamo and Alfv´en eﬀect. For stationary con-
ditions and in the inertial range, dimensional analysis of
(4) and (5) yields k3E2
k which can be re-
written as

k ∼ k2EMER

(6)

The relaxation time, Θ, appears as a factor on both sides
of the relation and, consequently, drops out. We note
that with τA ∼ (kb0)−1, where b0 is the mean magnetic
ﬁeld carried by the largest eddies, b0 ∼ (EM)1/2, and by
ℓ)1/2 ∼ (k3Ek)−1/2 (for system
re-deﬁning τNL ∼ ℓ/(v2
II all involved quantities are based on ﬁeld-perpendicular
ﬂuctuations) relation (6) can be obtained in the physi-
cally more instructive form

(7)

The modiﬁcation of τNL is motivated by considering that
gradients of the Alfv´en speed contribute to nonlinear
transfer as much as velocity shear (see, e.g., [30]).

For the examined setups relation (7) is consistent with
the underlying physical idea of dynamical equilibrium be-
tween Alfv´en and dynamo eﬀect. At small scales with
k ≫ k0 (for system II: k0 ≃ kf ), Alfv´enic interaction
always dominates the energy exchange since τA ≪ τNL
−1
D for system I: τA ≃ 5×10−2, τNL ≃ 0.2,
(e.g. at k = 0.3l
for system II: τA ≃ 1 × 10−2, τNL ≃ 0.1) which re-
sults in approximate spectral equipartiton of kinetic and
magnetic energy. At larger spatial scales the Alfv´en ef-
fect becomes less eﬃcient in balancing the transforma-
tion of kinetic to magnetic energy by the small-scale dy-
−1
D for system
namo with τA ≃ τNL (e.g. at k = 0.01l
−1
I: τA ≃ 0.9, τNL ≃ 0.8, at k = 3 × 10−3l
D for system
II: τA ≃ 1.2, τNL ≃ 0.9) allowing larger deviations from
equipartition.

An interesting consequence of (6) is that the diﬀer-
ence between possible spectral scaling exponents, which
is typically small and hard to measure reliably, is en-
larged by a factor of two in ER
k . Even with the limited
Reynolds numbers in today’s simulations such a magni-
ﬁed diﬀerence is clearly observable (e.g. dash-dotted lines
in Figs. 1 and 3). For system I with Kolmogorov scaling,
Ek ∼ k−5/3 (Fig. 1), relation (6) predicts ER
k ∼ k−7/3
in agreement with the simulation (Fig. 3). In the case of
Iroshnikov-Kraichnan behavior, Ek⊥ ∼ k
as realized
−2
in system II (Fig. 2), ER
⊥ is obtained. This result
is conﬁrmed by the residual energy spectrum shown in

In summary, based on the structure of the EDQNM
closure equations for incompressible MHD a model of
the nonlinear spectral interplay between kinetic and mag-
netic energy is formulated. Throughout the inertial range
a quasi-equilibrium of turbulent small-scale dynamo and
Alfv´en eﬀect leads to the relation, ER
k, linking to-
k ∼ k−7/3
tal and residual energy spectra, in particular ER
for Ek ∼ k−5/3 and ER
k ∼ k−2 for Ek ∼ k−3/2. Both
predictions are conﬁrmed by high-resolution direct nu-
merical simulations, limiting the possible validity of the
Goldreich-Sridhar phenomenology to MHD turbulence
with moderate mean magnetic ﬁelds.

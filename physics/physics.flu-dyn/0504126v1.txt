Abstract

We consider the ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid in a nano or microchannel with walls that have

patterned variations in slip length. We formulate a set of equations to describe the eﬀects on an

incompressible Newtonian ﬂow of small variations in slip, and solve these equations for slow ﬂows.

We test these equations using molecular dynamics simulations of ﬂow between two walls which

have patterned variations in wettability. Good qualitative agreement and a reasonable degree of

quantitative agreement is found between the theory and the molecular dynamics simulations. The

results of both analyses show that patterned wettability can be used to induce complex variations

in ﬂow. Finally we discuss the implications of our results for the design of microﬂuidic mixers using

slip.

INTRODUCTION

Several recent experiments [1, 2, 3, 4] report the measurement of large, shear-dependent

liquid slip at partially wetting liquid-solid surfaces. While the origin of these dramatic

violations of the no-slip boundary condition is still controversial [5], interest is beginning

to develop in how these eﬀects may be exploited in microﬂudics [6]. Microﬂudics is un-

dergoing rapid growth with applications to chemical and biochemical synthesis [7], and

high-throughput synthesis and screening [8]. These applications require the manipulation of

ﬂuids in microchannels where ﬂows are limited to very low Reynolds numbers. As a result,

mixing in microﬂuidic devices tends to be diﬀusion dominated, requiring long channels and

long retention times to achieve good mixing. As the scale of this technology continues to

diminish the eﬀects of low Reynolds numbers will become more signiﬁcant. However, the

eﬀect of slip at channel walls also increases at small length scales so it is natural to ask

whether the eﬀects of slip can be used to overcome some of the disadvantages of laminar

ﬂow [6].

To increase mixing rates it is necessary to induce transverse or circulating ﬂows in a

channel, increasing interfacial area between ﬂuids or streamlines (for a recent review see [9]).

This can be achieved by active mixers, which possess moving parts, but these can be diﬃcult

to fabricate and maintain. Passive mixers on the other hand achieve mixing by virtue of

their topology alone and have no moving parts. Suggested designs for passive mixers include

using channels with patterned topography [10, 11], or channels with patterned surface charge

in electro-osmotic ﬂows [12]. Another possibility is to use chemically patterned channel

surfaces. For example, Kuksenok and co-workers [13, 14, 15] have modeled the mixing of a

binary AB ﬂuid in channels patterned with A-like and B-like regions.

Yet another approach might be to use patterned wettability to induce variations in slip.

Slip is often characterised by a slip-length δ, which is the distance at which the ﬂuid ve-

locity at a surface (i.e. the slip velocity) vanishes if it is linearly extrapolated beyond the

surface. Measurements of slip lengths do vary widely but some groups have reported slip

lengths of several microns [1].

It is common to invoke the formation of nanobubbles at

the hydrophobic surface [16] to explain such large slip lengths. However there is still much

disagreement about the magnitude of slip that can be induced although lengths of tens to

hundreds of nanometers seem to be more typical [3, 4]. Furthermore other factors such as

2

surface roughness and surface contamination do seem inﬂuence slip length measurements

considerably [4, 16]. Lauga and Stone [17] have recently considered the eﬀect of patterned

no-slip and no-shear stress regions in pressure-driven Stokes ﬂow in a cylindrical geometry

where the no-shear stress regions model the presence of micro or nanobubbles on channel

walls. From this they derive an eﬀective macroscopic slip-length which indeed is found to

depend on shear-rate and geometry.

Here we will assume that the variations in wettability can produce variations in the slip

of the ﬂow at the channel walls. Molecular dynamics simulations of ﬂow past hydrophobic

surfaces [18, 19] certainly demonstrate a strong relationship between wettability and slip,

although the slip lengths found tend to be of the order of a few of tens molecular diameters

at most. However, as noted above, the formation of nanobubbles at hydrophobic surfaces

may well be able to induce very large slip lengths: thus large variations in wettability on a

surface might be expected to produce large variations in slip length.

We begin by studying a Newtonian ﬂow in a simple channel with a slip boundary condition

characterised by a slip-length δ that varies in space i.e. δ = δ(x). In the ﬁrst instance we are

interested in seeing the eﬀect of a variable slip length on the ﬂow, and secondly, in evaluating

the possible exploitation of such eﬀects in designing a microﬂuidic mixing device. As this is

a preliminary study, we will approach the problem analytically, using a pertubative scheme

to satisfy the slip boundary condition.

In section 4, we will use molecular dynamics simulations of the ﬂow of a Lennard-Jones

ﬂuid between two plates. The interaction between the plates and the ﬂuid will be allowed to

vary in space in order to test the predictions of the analysis in sections 2-3. We conclude with

a discussion of the implications of our ﬁndings here for the design of mixers in microchannels

using chemical patterning.

II. EQUATIONS FOR FLOWS WITH SPATIALLY VARYING SLIP

We start with the Navier-Stokes equations for a viscous incompressible ﬂuid:

∂t

ρ

 

+ u · ∇u

= −∇p + µ∇2u,

∇ · u = 0,

!

(1)

(2)

where u is the velocity ﬁeld, p the ﬂuid pressure, ρ is the ﬂuid density and µ is the ﬂuid

viscosity.

We consider a pressure driven ﬂow in a two-dimensional channel geometry corresponding

to ﬂow between two plates as illustrated in ﬁgure 1. The channel has length L and width

2w. At the channel walls we have Navier slip boundary condition [20]:

u(±w) = ∓δ

(±w)

∂u
∂y

where u is the longtunidal velocity component (x-direction). The transverse velocity com-

ponent v (y-direction) satisiﬁes v(±w) = 0 at the walls. At the channel exit and entry we

prescribe the pressure to be p0 and pL respectively giving a pressure head across the channel

of ∆p = p0 − pL.

The solution to (1-3) is

µL is the maximum ﬂuid velocity in the absence of slip.

We will now allow the slip length to vary in the x direction i.e.

Speciﬁcally, we will consider the following slip boundary condition:

If α ≪ 1 then we can apply a perturbative approach

u(±w) = ∓δ

The boundary condition immediately suggests the solution ansatz u1 = eikxf (y). Inserting

this into equation (14), we ﬁnd that

v1 = −ikeikxh(y)

where h′(y) = f (y) and h(0) = 0 since v1(0) = 0 by symmetry.

We can now eliminate p1 from (12) and (13) to obtain the following ordinary diﬀerential

equation for h(y):

We note that diﬀerential equation (17) is homogeneous, so the magnitude of h will be set

by the boundary condition (18). Further when α ≪ 1, (17) and (18) form a quasilinear

boundary value problem.

In the following section we will examine the solution to this

problem in a number of limiting cases.

III. RELEVANCE TO MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES

At this stage we will introduce some scales into the problem. As the eﬀects of boundary

slip on the ﬂow scale as δ/w (see equation 4), at widths substantially greater than the slip

length, a surface with patterned wettability will have an insigniﬁcant eﬀect on the ﬂow.

With values of the slip-length of up to several microns reported in the literature [1], we will

conﬁne ourselves to discussion of channels with widths w < 10 µm.

Obviously the wavelength of the slip variations 2π/k is bounded above by the length of

the channel L. The wavelength is bounded below by the minimum size on which the slip

5

can be patterned. While microcontact printing [21] or photolithography of hydrophilic or

hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers might be limited to wavelengths greater than several

hundred µm, in principle, it is still of interest to consider the limit as 2π/k ∼ 10 nm. This

might achieved using a combination of self-assembly by block copolymers and lithography for

example [22]. Hence it is reasonable to consider patternings that satisfy 107nm > 2π/k > 10

nm.

A. Slow ﬂows with ﬁne patterning

In the limit where U
kν

≪ 1 and U
kν

≪ k2w2 then equation (17) reduces to

d4h
dy4

− 2k2 d2h

dy2 + k4h = 0.

(19)

For instance, in the case of water which is ﬂowing at 0.01 ms−1 in a 10 µm-width channel (i.e.

1 nanoliter per second) then U/kν ≪ w2k2 ≪ 1 for 1/k ≪ 20µm. Note that equation (19)

is real (whereas the equation (17) is complex) so the variation in longitudinal ﬂow velocity

is in phase with the variations in slip length while the variations in transverse ﬂow velocity

are 90o out of phase with the variations in slip length (recall equation (16)).

The solution to (19) with boundary condition (18) to order α is given by

h (y) = U

δ
w !

 

(w − y) sinh k (w + y) − (w + y) sinh k (w − y)
sinh 2kw + 2kδ cosh 2kw − 4k(w + δ)

(20)

where we recall that v1 = −ikeikxh(y) and u1 = eikxh′(y). Figure 2 shows h(y) for kw = 10,

1 and 0.1. It is clear from (19) and ﬁgure 2 that the magnitude of kw controls the variation

away from the walls in h(y) and hence in v1 and u1. With kw ≪ 1, then the transverse

velocity induced v1 is conﬁned to very near the walls. Indeed, from ﬁgure 2 we see that to

maximize both the magnitude of h(y), and its penetration towards the centre of the channel
we should choose kw ∼ 1. Similarly, ﬁgure 3 shows h′(y) for kw = 10, 1 and 0.1.

Figure 4 shows a ﬂooded contour plot of the variations in both velocity components (u1

and v1) along a long channel (L = 20w) with kw = 1, and ﬁgure 5 shows a vector plot of the

velocity components in a shorter channel (L = πw) with kw = 1. Note that where the slip

at the channel wall is high, the ﬂow velocity increases at the channel walls, but decreases in

the center of the channel. Likewise, where the slip is low, the ﬂow velocity decreases at the

6

channel wall but increases in the center of the channel. Between the peaks and troughs in

slip, transverse ﬂow is generated away from or towards the channel walls.

We can also look at square-wave variations in slip length, utilizing the Fourier series for

a square wave of wavelength λ = 2π/k:

Since equation (19) is linear we can solve for each Fourier mode and resum to obtain the

solution for a square wave variation in δ(x). Doing so gives

f (x) =

Figure 6 shows a ﬂooded contour plot of the velocity components v1 and u1 for a square

wave variation in δ with kw = 1.

B. Slow ﬂows with larger scale patterning

Now we consider the situation where 1 ≫ U
∼ k2w2. For instance, in the case of water
kν
which is ﬂowing at 0.01 ms−1 in a 10 µm-width channel (i.e. 1 nanoliter per second) then
U/kν ∼ w2k2 ≪ 1 for 1/k ∼ 20µm. This corresponds to a slow ﬂow with spatial variations

in slip length occuring on scales greater than the channel width. Now equation (17) reduces

Note that the ﬁrst order correction in

w2k3ν is purely imaginary. Thus it introduces a phase
lag the response of the ﬂuid to the slip at the walls (moving it downstream) and increases

U

the magnitude of h(y). This is shown in ﬁgure 7 which compares the velocity u1 in the

centre of the channel for ∆δ = δ sin kx (kw = 0.1) for

value of

w2k3ν is chosen here so that the eﬀect of this term is easily visible).

IV. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS

To study the eﬀect of spatially varying wettability on ﬂow in a channel at a molecular level,

we have followed the approach of Barrat and Bocquet [18, 19]. We consider a Lennard-Jones

ﬂuid with atomic mass m conﬁned between two walls with periodic boundary conditions

applied in the plane of the walls. The walls consist of ﬁxed Lennard-Jones atoms and

interact with the ﬂuid via a modiﬁed Lennard-Jones potential of the form:

φ(rij) = 4ǫ



 



12

σ
rij !

− cf s

6

σ
rij !

 





where 0 < cf s ≤ 1 controls the degree of wettability of the walls [18]. Note that the ﬂuid

atoms also interact according to potential (30) with cf f = 1.2. Here we will consider ﬂows

where cf s = cf s(x) to model the eﬀect of chemical patterning of the channel walls.

We used a simulation cell containing 6750 ﬂuid atoms within a volume of approximately

(20σ)3. The temperature was controlled using Nos´e-Hoover thermostat [23] on the velocity

component of the ﬂuid atoms parallel to the channel walls but perpendicular to the imposed

8

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

ﬂow direction (in ﬁgure 1 this is the direction into the page). Flow can be induced by

applying a body force to the ﬂuid atoms in a direction parallel to walls giving a Poiseuille-

type ﬂow, or by dragging one of the walls past the ﬂuid which induces a Couette ﬂow. Here

we only consider the former as our intention is to make a comparison with the pressure-driven

ﬂows of the previous section.

When cf s = 1.0 everywhere the ﬂows are well-approximated by solutions to the incom-

pressible Navier-Stokes equations (1-2) with a no-slip boundary condition, although density

variations occur near the walls due to the well-known tendancy for ﬂuid atoms to layer at

a solid interface. Furthermore, when 0.5 < cf s < 1.0 but is constant everywhere, we ﬁnd

that the ﬂow is reasonably well-approximated by solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations

with a slip boundary condition (3). Our simulations are in good agreement with Barrat and

Bocquet [18, 19].

equation for cf s on the channel walls is:

We now consider the simulation of ﬂows in a channel with patterned slip length. The

cf s = 


0.9

0.5

if sin kx ≥ 0

if sin kx < 0

(31)

where kw = π (i.e. the wavelength of the pattern is 20 σ, which is the width of channel).



Note that the mean value of cf s is 0.7. Our simulations show that such a patterning does

indeed induce a variation in slip length along the channel walls. For instance, as illustrated in

ﬁgure 8 for a simulated ﬂow with peak ﬂow longitudinal ﬂow velocity U = 1.30 (ǫ/m)1/2, we

calculated an eﬀective slip length of δ = 9.1 σ by ﬁtting a parabolic proﬁle U(1+δ/w−y2/w2)

to the longitudinal velocity proﬁle in the solvophilic region (x > 0 i.e. where cf s = 0.9). In

the the solvophobic region (x < 0 cf s = 0.5) we calculated an eﬀective slip length δ = 13.0 σ.

Similarly, for a simulated ﬂow with peak ﬂow longitudinal ﬂow velocity U = 0.4 (ǫ/m)1/2,

we calculated an eﬀective slip length of δ = 3.6 σ in the solvophilic region (x > 0 i.e. where

cf s = 0.9). Likewise in the the solvophobic region (x < 0 cf s = 0.5) we calculated an

eﬀective slip length δ = 6.7 σ.

Furthermore, these variations in eﬀective slip length induce transverse ﬂows as anticipated

in the previous sections. Figure 9 shows the time-averaged transverse velocity of a ﬂow,

with peak longitudinal ﬂow velocity U = 0.4 (ǫ/m)1/2. The peak transverse velocity is

V = 0.03 (ǫ/m)1/2. Regions with light shading indicate ﬂow in the y-direction and regions

9

with dark shading indicate ﬂow in the negative y-direction. Note that the variations in

v(x, y) are 90o out of phase with the variations in cf s as predicted by our analysis in section

3. To compare the magnitude of the variations in v from the simulation to the theory of

the previous sections, we use the eﬀective slip lengths calculated above. Thus δ = 5.2 σ

and α = 0.3 in equation (8). Figure 10 compares the theoretically expected variation in v

at x = 0 across the channel for a square wave variation in slip length (see equation (23))

to the time-averaged simulated variations. It is seen from the comparison that the theory

underestimates the peak values of v by a factor of 2-3.

Figure 11 shows a faster ﬂow with peak longitudinal ﬂow velocity is U = 1.30 (ǫ/m)1/2

and peak transverse velocity is V = 0.060 (ǫ/m)1/2. Regions with light shading indicate ﬂow

in the y-direction and regions with dark shading indicate ﬂow in the negative y-direction.

Note the downstream phase lag in the variations in v(x, y) with respect to the variations in

v(x, y) in the slower ﬂow shown in ﬁgure 9. We have not made a direct comparison of this

phase lag with the predicted phase lag in equation (27) as we were unable to solve the full

equation for h (17) for fast ﬂows analytically. However, once again we ﬁnd that the theory

underestimates the peak values of v by a factor of 2.

V. DISCUSSION

The molecular dynamics simulations in section 4 demonstrate that patterned wettability

will induce patterned variations in slip length. While this is not surprising given the demon-

stratated link between wettability and slip in othe rmolecular dynamics simulations [18], it

supports the use of the boundary condition (7) in evaluating the eﬀect of patterned wetta-

bility on ﬂow. Furthermore we found a strong qualitative agreement between the molecular

dynamics simulations and the approximate analytic solutions developed in sections 2-3, al-

though the theory tended to underestimate the magnitude of the variations in ﬂow due the

patterning by a factor of 2. This underestimation may in part be due to the way the theory

was ﬁtted to the simulations (i.e. by ﬁtting eﬀective slip lengths in the diﬀerent channel

regions). However, the theory also assumes the ﬂuid is incompressible, whereas substantial

variations in ﬂuid density can occur at the walls. In particular, a reduction in the density

of the ﬂuid near the solvophobic region of the wall relative to the solvophilic region of the

wall, as observed in the MD simulations, would tend to enhance the transverse variations

10

in ﬂow. Finally, we note that in our analysis in sections 2-3 we only solved the slip bound-

ary condition to order α (the relative variation in slip length). In the molecular dynamics

simulations conducted here α was found to be 0.2-0.3.

In any case our calculations here have demonstrated that in an incompressible Newtonian

ﬂuid, changes in slip length can induce ﬂow transverse to the walls in a nano or microﬂuidic

channel. Further our calculations suggest that these transverse ﬂows are maximised if the

patterning of slip takes place on a wavelength λ ∼ w. Thus it certainly appears that

patterned slip could be used to induce mixing in the same way as patterned topography

(e.g. such as the asymmetric herringbone pattern studied in Ref [10]). Figure 12 suggests

some possible patternings that could be used for mixing. However, we note that slip also

changes the velocity proﬁle in a channel (e.g. see ﬁgure 8). These changes in proﬁle will no

doubt alter the eﬀect of dispersion on mixing in a channel.

We also note that surfaces with switchable wettability have recently been demonstrated

[24]. This switchability suggests the interesting prospect of a slip length which is time and

space dependent i.e. δ = δ(x, t). The approach outlined in section 2 can easily be adapted

to consider this situation. If we imagine a traveling wave variation in slip length δ(ωt + kx),

then in a frame comoving with this wave, the eﬀects on the ﬂow will appear similar to those

of speeding up (or slowing down) the ﬂow. Thus the response of the ﬂuid to a rapidly

changing time-dependent slip will lag these changes in slip (as the ﬂuid response does for

the fast moving ﬂow in ﬁgure 7). We will consider this problem in more detail in further

work.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have considered the ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid in a channel with spatially varying

surface properties. Using a pertubative approach we derived equations that describe ﬂow

in a channel with patterned variations in slip length. We also examined ﬂows in a channel

with varying wettability using molecular dynamics. The simulations demonstrated that the

variations in wettability induce variations in slip. Good qualitative agreement was found

between the molecular dynamics simulations and the approximate analysis of the Navier-

Stokes equations.

FIG. 8: This plot shows the time-averaged longitudinal velocity u across the channel at x = 5 σ

(where cf s = 0.9) and at x = −5 σ (where cf s = 0.5). We calculate the eﬀective slip length by

ﬁtting U (1 + δ/w − y2/w2) to the proﬁles (ﬁts are shown). In the solvophilic region (x > 0 i.e.

where cf s = 0.9) we calculated an eﬀective slip length of δ = 9.1 σ and in the the solvophobic

region (x = −0.5 cf s = 0.5) we calculated an eﬀective slip length δ = 13.0 σ.

the walls of the molecular dynamics simulation, the eﬀective slip lengths δeﬀ induced by cf s and
a corresonding contour plot showing the variations in v(x, y) = v1(x, y). The channel width is

2w = 20σ with periodic boundary conditions applied at x = ±10σ. The peak longitudinal ﬂow

velocity is U = 0.4(ǫ/m)1/2 and the peak transverse velocity is V = 0.03(ǫ/m)1/2. Regions with

light shading indicate ﬂow in the y-direction and regions with light shading indicate ﬂow in the

negative y-direction. Note that the variations in v(x, y) are 90o out of phase with the variations in

cf s.

FIG. 10: A comparison of the transverse velocity v at x = 0 across the channel from the simulation

in ﬁgure 9 and from theory. The theory has been ﬁtted to the simulation data by calculating an

eﬀective slip length δ = 6.7 σ across the solvophilic region (x > 0 i.e. where cf s = 0.9) and an

eﬀective slip length δ = 3.6 σ across the solvophobic region (x < 0 cf s = 0.5). Thus δ = 5.2 σ and

α = 0.3. It is seen from the comparison that the theory underestimates the peak values of v by a

factor of 2-3.

walls of the molecular dynamics simulation, the eﬀective slip lengths δeﬀ induced by cf s and the
corresponding variations in v(x, y) = v1(x, y) in a channel. The channel width is 2w = 20σ with

periodic boundary conditions applied at x = ±10σ. The peak ﬂow velocity is U = 1.30(ǫ/m)1/2

and the peak transverse velocity is V = 0.060(ǫ/m)1/2. Regions with light shading indicate ﬂow in

the y-direction and regions with light shading indicate ﬂow in the negative y-direction. Note the

downstream phase shift in the variations in v(x, y) with respect to the variations in cf s, especially

in comparion with ﬁgure 9.

FIG. 12: Suggested designs for mixing devices. The light regions would be coated in such a way

as to induce a large slip length (say with a superhydrophobic coating), while the dark regions

would be coated to induce a small slip length or no slip (say with a superhydrophilic coating).

More complicated patterns may enhance the mixing, provided the patterns are on a length scale

comparable to the channel width.

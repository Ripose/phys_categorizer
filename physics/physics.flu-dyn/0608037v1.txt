Abstract

We investigate a torsional pendulum containing a ferroﬂuid that is forced periodically to undergo

small-amplitude oscillations. A homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicular to the pendu-

lum axis. We give an analytical formula for the ferroﬂuid-induced “selfenergy” in the pendulum’s

dynamic response function for monodisperse as well as for polydisperse ferroﬂuids.

Real ferroﬂuids [1] contain magnetic particles of diﬀerent sizes [2]. This polydispersity

strongly inﬂuences the macroscopic magnetic properties of the ferroﬂuid. We investigate

here the eﬀect of polydispersity on the dynamic response of a ferroﬂuid pendulum.

A torsional pendulum containing a ferroﬂuid is forced periodically in a homogeneous

magnetic ﬁeld Hext = Hextex that is applied perpendicular to the pendulum axis ez (see

ﬁg. 1). Such a ferroﬂuid pendulum is used for measuring the rotational viscosity [3]. The

cylindrical ferroﬂuid container is here of suﬃciently large length to be approximated as

an inﬁnite long cylinder. We consider rigid-body rotation of the ferroﬂuid with the time

dependent angular velocity Ω = ˙ϕez as can be realized with the set-up of [3]. The ﬁelds H

and M inside the cylinder are spatially homogeneous and oscillating in time.

II. EQUATIONS

related to each other via

First, the Maxwell equations demand that the ﬁelds H and M within the ferroﬂuid are

with N = 1/2 for the inﬁnitely long cylinder. Then we have the torque balance

and f (t) is the external mechanical forcing.

Finally, we need an equation describing the magnetization dynamics. Here, we consider

the polydisperse ferroﬂuid as a mixture of ideal monodisperse paramagnetic ﬂuids. Then

the resulting magnetization is given by M =

Mj, where Mj denotes the magnetization

of the particles with diameter dj. We assume that each Mj obeys a simple Debye relaxation

following by an index 0 one has ϕ0 = Ω0 = M j0

y = 0 and M j0

some experimental parameters from [3]: ω0/2π = 32.7Hz, Γ0 = 0.178Hz, V /Θ = 20m/kg.

The cylinder is ﬁlled with the ferroﬂuid APG 933 of FERROTEC. Therefore, we used in

equation (3.13) an experimental τ = 0.6ms and the experimental Meq(H) shown in ﬁg. 2.

These monodisperse results were compared with the expression (3.12) for the polydisperse

case for the typical parameter values Mmat = 456kA/m, η = 0.5P a
s, s = 2nm, K =
44kJ/m3 and f0 = 109Hz. The contributions w(dj) that enter into the formulas (2.5) for

the susceptibilities χj are given by a lognormal distribution [2]:

Fitting the experimental Meq(H) with a sum of Langevin functions (2.5) yields Msat =

18149A/m, d0 = 7nm and σ = 1.47 (see ﬁg. 2). We used here 30 diﬀerent particle sizes

from d1 = 1nm to d30 = 30nm (see ﬁg. 3).

The calculations show the additional damping rate caused by the interaction between

ferroﬂuid and external ﬁeld. An increasing magnetic ﬁeld leads to smaller amplitudes; in

polydisperse ferroﬂuids the amplitude decreases faster [ﬁg. 4 and 5 (a)]. Furthermore,

one can see a shift of the peak position to higher frequencies ωmax, which is stronger in

polydisperse ferroﬂuids [ﬁg. 4 and 5 (b)].

In this paper we present an experimental study of the dynamic responses of a Newtonian ﬂuid
and a Maxwellian ﬂuid under an oscillating pressure gradient. We use laser Doppler anemometry in
order to determine the velocity of each ﬂuid inside a cylindrical tube. In the case of the Newtonian
ﬂuid, the dissipative nature is observed and the response obeys the Zhou and Sheng universality [2].
In the dynamic response of the Maxwellian ﬂuid an enhancement at the frequencies predicted by
the corresponding theory [10] is observed.

The concept of dynamic permeability was proposed several years ago [1], [2] and is extensively used in the study
of practical problems such as petroleum recovery [3], soil-ground water transport [4], acoustic waves in porous media
[5], wave propagation in foams [6], ﬂuid circulation in biological systems [7], etc. Nevertheless the use of the dynamic
permeability in this kind of systems is not quite correct, because in some of them, the ﬂuid does not behave as
a Newtonian ﬂuid and shows viscoelastic features. Therefore the expression obtained by Johnson et al.
[1] is not
applicable. Recently, theoretical analyses of viscoelastic ﬂuids have predicted a interesting enhancement in the
dynamic permeability of several orders of magnitude in comparison with the static permeability [8], [9], [10], [11].
This behavior is due to the resonance of the ﬂuid elastic property and is completely diﬀerent from the pure dissipative
behavior of Newtonian ﬂuids. Since many years ago the increase in the ﬂow rate of a viscoelastic ﬂuid ﬂowing in a
tube under oscillating conditions is well known [12], [13] [14], [15]. However, the experimental analysis in terms of the
frequency dependent permeability has not yet been performed. The theoretical studies have explored some interesting
consequences of the enhancement in the dynamic permeability in diﬀerent systems including viscoelastic ﬂuids [10],
[16], [17], [18], [11], [19]. The variety of systems where an oscillating pressure can be imposed to a viscoelastic ﬂuid
is wide, for instance the oil recovery problem [20], and for the dynamic analysis of ﬂuid transport in animals or,
even, human body [21]. Therefore those theoretical studies deserve an experimental veriﬁcation. All these theoretical
derivations of the dynamic permeability for viscoelastic ﬂuids have been made in terms of the averaged velocity. In
this work we perform a more detailed analysis by measuring the dynamic response at the center of a cylindrical tube.
We develop an experimental setup consisting of a ﬂuid cylinder column that is moved by a piston in an oscillatory
way. The punctual velocity [27] is measured using a laser Doppler anemometer (LDA). This experimental setup
allows us to validate the punctual model for both Newtonian and Maxwellian ﬂuids. Our results indicate that this
simple linear model can capture the diﬀerences between the dissipative (Newtonian ﬂuid) and resonant (Maxwellian
ﬂuid) behaviors.

In the following, we present the pertinent equations used to obtain a punctual expression for the Maxwellian ﬂuid

response based on the results presented in [10]. We begin with the linearized momentum equation

and the continuity equation

for an incompressible ﬂuid. In the above equations, ρ is the mass density of the ﬂuid, v is the ﬂuid velocity, p is
the pressure, and ←→τ is the viscous stress tensor. To ensure the validity of Eq. (1) it is necessary to consider low
Reynolds numbers, in our case: Re < 7x10−4. As the constitutive equation of the ﬂuid, we use the linearized Maxwell
model

where η is the dynamic viscosity and tm is the relaxation time. We need to stress that the linearized Maxwell model

, a is the cylinder radius, P and V are respectively the pressure and the velocity
where β =
in the frequency domain, ω is the angular frequency, and J0 is the cilyndrical Bessel function of zeroth order. A
more detailed derivation of these expressions can be found in [10] and [18]. From the above, the previous theoretical
analyses of the dynamic permeability of viscoelastic ﬂuids deal with an average velocity. Here we analyze the ﬂow
from a diﬀerent point of view. We deﬁne a ”punctual response” as the response of the ﬂuid to a pressure drop in a
particular place inside the tube. This is needed because LDA measures quasi-punctual particle velocities. Thus in
order to analyze the punctual dynamic response, we evaluate Eq. (4) at the center of the cylinder (r = 0)

The evaluation can be made any where, however, from the experimentally point of view it is better to measure at the
central point because it is the position with maximum velocity amplitude. We deﬁne the punctual dynamic response
based on Darcy’s generalized equation [8], as

Then substituting the velocity, given by Eq. (5), we obtain

In order to compare the last expression with experimental results, we need an expression for the pressure gradient.
In our experimental case, we have a harmonic oscillating ﬂuid column, that is moved by a piston coupled to a motor
with adjustable frequency. The pressure can be easily calculated as

which corresponds to the oscillatory movement in the z direction with z0 as the displacement amplitude. Due to
the fact that the range of frequencies which can be solved measuring the root mean square (rms) velocity is wider
than the one using the Fourier transform of the velocity data, we measure the rms-velocity. Thus, the experimental
dynamic response (k(ω)) of a ﬂuid can be calculated using the following expression

P (z, t) = zρz0ω2 sin(ωt),

.

The value of the punctual dynamic response obtained using the previous expression for each experiment can be
(7) for the corresponding ω value, due to the fact that the

compared with the theoretical prediction from Eq.
experimental velocity is harmonic.

The experimental system was designed in order to have a harmonic oscillating pressure, c.f. Eq. (8). The device
consists of a vertical cylinder ﬁlled with a ﬂuid. The oscillating movement was produced with a piston that closes
the base of the cylinder; the piston is moved by a motor of variable frequency. The instrumentation of the device
includes a laser Doppler anemometer used to meassure the punctual velocity. A scheme of the complete device is
shown in Fig. 1. The cylindrical tube used is made of transparent acrylic with an inner diameter of 5 cm and a length
of 50 cm. In its lower end, this tube is joined by a clamp, to a stainless steel piston skirt of the same inner diameter.
Within the stainless steel skirt, there is a teﬂon piston that is moved by a Siemens motor of 1Hp, regulated by a
Varispeed 606PC3 system. This allows us to vary the frequency of oscillation from 1.5 Hz to 200 Hz. The acrylic
cylinder, over the skirt, is contained in a square recipient with parallel walls of transparent acrylic, ﬁlled with glycerol
that has a similar refractive index to the one of the acrylic, in order to avoid cylindrical aberration (deformation due
to the fact that the cylinder acts as a lens). In this and other cases, when there are cylindrical conﬁgurations, these
aberrations could cause a null intersection between the LDA beams or could result in the backscattering signal not
being received by the photomultiplier.

For the velocity measurements we used a laser Doppler anemometer. The LDA is a widely known system [22].
Our LDA consists of a probe (Dantec FiberFlow 60x20), a photomultiplier, a Burst Spectrum Analyzer (Dantec
BSA 57N11), and an argon laser (Spectra Physics model 177) emitting in four wavelengths; the 488 nm line (200
mW) is the one used, and the data are processed in a PC with the Dantec FlowManager software. The measurement
volume is 0.64 mm
0.075 mm. The LDA probe was set into a positioning system (with precision of 1
µm) placed on a diﬀerent table from the rest of the setup, to prevent oscillations that could alter the experimental
data. The measurement volume is placed at the center of the acrylic cylinder and the rms-velocity is calculated from
the collected data.

was 0.8
They remain suspended for a long time, have minimal drag, and a minimal standard deviation on the velocity data
since the size of the particles is uniform. Measurements were taken approximately 5 minutes after every change of
frequency, when a non transient state was attained.

For each frequency we acquired 2,000 velocity data, with the LDA, at the cylinder axis and 40 cm above the piston,
where edge eﬀects are negligible. Experiments are made in the oscillating frequency range of 1.5 to 15 Hz, having an
uncertainty of 0.1 Hz. The calculated rms-velocity from the LDA measurements for CPyCl/NaSal and for glycerol
are shown in Fig 2. The measured Maxwellian velocity is dramatically diﬀerent from the Newtonian velocity in the
studied range. Clearly the rms-velocity increases with the frequency in both cases, but the velocity of the viscoelastic
ﬂuid shows well-deﬁned peaks. An important point to be stressed is the fact that the linear behavior of the velocity
in the glycerol case emphasizes the good quality of the mechanical piston movement. Moreover, this conﬁrms that
the movement of the piston is transmitted directly to the ﬂuid, showing a linear function of the velocity with respect
to the frequency.

The dissipative nature of the glycerol response is clearly seen in the Fig. 3, as was inferred by the pioneers in the
analysis of the dynamic permeability [1], [2]. In this plot the glycerol dynamic response is nondimensionalized with
its value at ω = 0 and we use the viscous time τ = a
to obtain a dimensionless frequency. We have plotted the
η
dimensionless glycerol punctual response and its corresponding prediction from the results of Zhou and Sheng [2],
and we have found that they are in good agreement. The glycerol experiment is a good evidence of the validity of
the predictions made by Johnson et al. [1] and Zhou and Sheng [2].

The dimensionless dynamic response of CPyCl/NaSal is shown in Fig. 4. Experimental values are plotted together
with theoretical predictions using Eq.(9). A dramatic change in the behavior of the dimensionless Maxwellian response
with respect to the dissipative Newtonian case is observed, namely resonant frequencies appear. The agreement with
Eq. (7) is manifest. The position of the peaks in Eq. (7) and in the experiments is at approximately the same
ω’s, eventhough the amplitudes diﬀer considerably. We need to emphasize that the theory is linear and neglects the
convective term as well as the possible non linearities in the viscoelastic behavior of the ﬂuid. This result is the ﬁrst

experimental evidence of the validity of the theory developed in refs.[9], [10], [18].

In this work we have developed a punctual dynamic permeability expression for a Newtonian and a viscoelastic
ﬂuid, following previous works [1], [2], [9], [10], and compared with LDA measurements made in a harmonic oscillating
pressure system. For Newtonian ﬂuid the dissipative behavior is conﬁrmed.

In the case of the Maxwellian ﬂuid, although the theoretical model is a drastic simpliﬁcation of the viscoelastic
behavior, it is capable of reproducing the resonant behavior of the dynamic response. The resonances appearing in
the viscoelastic response, as expected, are signiﬁcantly higher than the monotonic decay in the Newtonian response.
In both cases here presented, the qualitatively agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results
is evident; quantitatively there are some diﬀerences, probably due to the linear nature of the models. Clearly, our
experimental results show that the dynamic response of viscoelastic ﬂuids exceeds the static response for some speciﬁc
frequencies in fair agreement with the theory for such systems.

Finaly we want to stress that the results presented in this paper have a wide spectrum of applications, from oil
recovery [20] to the dynamical analysis of biological ﬂuids [21] [26]. In fact the present results may give a diﬀerent
physical interpretation to the aforementioned analysis.

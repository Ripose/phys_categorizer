Vortex line representation for ﬂows of ideal
and viscous ﬂuids [1]

Abstract

It is shown that the Euler hydrodynamics for vortical ﬂows of an ideal
ﬂuid coincides with the equations of motion of a charged compressible ﬂuid
moving due to a self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁeld. Transition to the La-
grangian description in a new hydrodynamics is equivalent for the original
Euler equations to the mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description - the vortex
line representation (VLR) [2]. Due to compressibility of a ”new” ﬂuid the
collapse of vortex lines can happen as the result of breaking (or overturning)
of vortex lines. It is found that the Navier-Stokes equation in the vortex line
representation can be reduced to the equation of the diﬀusive type for the
Cauchy invariant with the diﬀusion tensor given by the metric of the VLR.

1. Collapse as a process of a singularity formation in a ﬁnite time from the
initially smooth distribution plays the very important role being considered as one
of the most eﬀective mechanisms of the energy dissipation. For hydrodynamics of
incompressible ﬂuids collapse must play also a very essential role. It is well known
that appearance of singularity in gasodynamics, i.e., in compressible hydrodynam-
ics, is connected with the phenomenon of breaking that is the physical mechanism
leading to emergence of shocks. From the point of view of the classical catastrophe
theory [3] this process is nothing more than the formation of folds. It is completely
characterized by the mapping corresponding to transition from the Eulerian de-
scription to the Lagrangian one. Vanishing the Jacobian J of this mapping means
emergence of a singularity for spatial derivatives of velocity and density of a gas.
In the incompressible case breaking as intersection of trajectories of Lagrangian
particles is absent because the Jacobian of the corresponding mapping is ﬁxed, in
the simplest case equal to unity. By this reason, it would seem that there were
no any reasons for existence of such phenomenon at all. In spite of this fact, as
it was shown in [4, 5, 6], breaking, however, is possible in this case also.
It can
happen with vortex lines. Unlike the breaking in gasodynamics, the breaking of

1

vortex lines means that one vortex line reaches another vortex line. For smooth
initial conditions breaking happens ﬁrst time while touching vortex lines at a single
point. In the touching point the vorticity becomes inﬁnite. And this is possible in
spite of incompressibility of both divergence-free ﬁelds, i.e., vorticity and velocity.
To describe the breaking of vortex lines in the papers [2, 7] it was suggested the
vortex line representation – a mixed Lagrangian-Eulerian description when each
vortex line is labeled by a two-dimensional marker and another parameter deﬁnes
the vortex line itself.

This paper is devoted to development of this method to apply to both ideal
and viscous ﬂuids. We clarify the role of the Clebsch variables in the vortex line
representation: these variables can be used as Lagrangian markers of vortex lines.
However, as well known, these variables can be introduced always only locally and,
generally speaking, can not be extended for the whole space. In the general situa-
tion we demonstrate in this paper that transition to the vortex line representation is
equivalent to consideration of a new compressible hydrodynamics of a charged ﬂuid
ﬂowing under action of a self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this case the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds satisfy the Maxwell equations. The most essential property
of a new hydrodynamics is a compressibility of a new ﬂuid that for its Lagrangian
description means compressibility of the corresponding mapping and, respectively,
a possibility of a breaking. In terms of the Eulerian characteristics this results in
the breaking of vortex lines when the vorticity Ω = curl v takes inﬁnite value. In
the framework of the new hydrodynamics of a charged ﬂuid the role of density plays
the quantity inverse to J which is naturally called as a density of vortex lines. This
quantity appears from the Cauchy formula for the vorticity Ω. Evolution of the
vortex line density in time and space is deﬁned by the velocity component normal
to the vorticity. As it is shown in this paper the Cauchy formula can be obtained
from a “new” Kelvin theorem as well as from the analog of the Weber transforma-
tion. As the result, the Euler equations turn out to be resolved with respect to the
Cauchy invariants, i.e., relative to the inﬁnite number of integrals of motion. In
this case one can consider the Euler equations as the partially integrated equations.
This circumstance is very important for numerical solution of the Euler equation.
The vortex line representation can be applied not only to ideal hydrodynamics
but also to ﬂow description of viscous incompressible ﬂuids in the framework of the
Navier-Stokes equation. In the paper we obtain the equation of the diﬀusion type
describing dynamics of the Cauchy invariant in the viscous case with the “diﬀusion
tensor” determined by the VLR metric. In its form this equation coincides with
the equation derived in [8].
In this case the equations of motion of vortex lines
in its original (for ideal ﬂuids) form are understood as the equations given the
transformation to a new curvilinear system of coordinates. The obtained exact
equations for description of viscous ﬂows can be considered as the result of exact
separation of two diﬀerent temporal scales: the inertial (in fact, nonlinear) scale
and the viscous one.

incompressible ﬂuid,

∂v

+ (v∇)v = −∇p,

div v = 0,

(1)

in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases possess the inﬁnite (continu-
ous) number of integrals of motion. These are the so called Cauchy invariants. The
most simple way to derive the Cauchy invariants is one to use the Kelvin theorem
about conservation of the velocity circulation,

where the integration contour C[r(t)] moves together with a ﬂuid. If in this expres-
sion one makes a transform from the Eulerian coordinate r to the Lagrangian ones
a then Eq. (2) can be rewritten as follows:

where a new contour C[a] is already immovable. Hence, due to arbitrariness of the
contour C[a] and using the Stokes formula one can conclude that the quantity

conserves in time at each point a. This is just the Cauchy invariant. If the La-
grangian coordinates a in (3) coincide with the initial positions of ﬂuid particles the
invariant I is equal to the initial vorticity Ω0(a).

Conservation of these invariants, as it was shown ﬁrst by Salmon [10], is conse-
quence of the special (inﬁnite) symmetry - the so-called relabeling symmetry. The
Cauchy invariants characterize the frozenness of the vorticity into ﬂuid. This is a
very important property according to which ﬂuid (Lagrangian) particles can not
leave its own vortex line where they were initially. Thus, the Lagrangian particles
have one independent degree of freedom – motion along vortex line. From another
side, such a motion as it follows from the equation for the vorticity

does not change its value. From this point of view a vortex line represents the
invariant object and therefore it is natural to seek for such a transformation when
this invariance is seen from the very beginning. Such type of description - the vortex
line representation - was introduced in the papers [2, 7] by Ruban and the author
of this paper.

3. Consider the vortical ﬂow (Ω 6= 0) of an ideal ﬂuid given by the Clebsch

variables λ and µ:

Ω = [∇λ × ∇µ].

The geometrical meaning of these variables is well known: intersection of two sur-
faces λ = const and µ = const yields the vortex line.
It is known also that in
the incompressible case the Clebsch variables are Lagrangian invariants, being un-
changed along trajectories of ﬂuid particles:

∂λ
∂t

+ (v∇)λ = 0;

+ (v∇)µ = 0.

Therefore these variables can be taken as markers for vortex lines. It is easily to
establish that transition in (5) to new variables

λ = λ(x, y, z),

µ = µ(x, y, z),

s = s(x, y, z),

where s is the parameter given the vortex line, leads to the expression

where

(10)

The transform (10) inverse to (7) deﬁnes the corresponding transition to the curvi-
linear, connected with vortex lines, system of coordinates.

The equations of motion of vortex lines - the equations for R(λ, µ, s, t) – can be
obtained directly from the equation of motion for the vorticity (4). However, the
most simple way to derive them is to use the combination of the equations (6):

which is identical to (6) due to a linear independence of the vectors ∇λ and ∇µ.

Performing in (11) the transformations (7), we arrive at the equation of motion

for vortex lines [2]:

This equation has one important property: any motion along a vortex line does not
change the line itself. It is easily to check that Eq. (12) is equivalent to the equation

In accordance with the Darboux theorem, the Clebsch variables can be intro-
It is well known also that the ﬂows pa-
duced locally always but not globally.
(v · rot v)dr –
rameterized by the Clebsch variables has a zero helicity integral
the topological invariant which characterizes a degree of knottiness of vortex lines.
Therefore to introduce the vortex line representation for ﬂows with nontrivial topol-
ogy it is necessary to come back to the original equations of motion (1) and (4) for
velocity and vorticity.

4. According to the equation (4) the tangent to the vector Ω velocity component
vτ does not eﬀect (directly) on the vorticity dynamics, i.e., in (4) we can put, instead
of v, its transverse component vn.

The equation of motion for the transverse velocity vn follows directly from the
equation (1). It has the form of the equation of motion of charged particle moving
in an electromagnetic ﬁeld:

where the eﬀective electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by the expressions:

div A = −div vn,

Interesting to note that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds introduced above are ex-
pressed through the scalar ϕ and vector A potentials by the standard way:

so that two Maxwell equations

satisfy automatically. In this case the vector potential A has the gauge

which is equivalent to the condition div v = 0.

Two other Maxwell equations can be written also but they can be considered as
deﬁnition of the charge density ρ and the current j which follow from the relations
(15) and (16). The basic equation in the new hydrodynamics is the equation of
motion (14) for the normal component of the velocity which represents the equation

5

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

of motion for nonrelativistic particle with a charge and a mass equal to unity, the
light velocity in this units is equal to 1.

The equation of motion (14) is written in the Eulerian representation. To trans-
fer to its Lagrangian formulation one needs to consider the equations for ”trajecto-
ries” given by the velocity vn:

with initial conditions

Solution of the equation (18) yields the mapping

dR
dt

= vn(R, t)

R|t=0 = a.

r = R(a, t),

which deﬁnes transition from the Eulerian description to a new Lagrangian one.

The equations of motion in new variables are the Hamilton equations:

where dot means diﬀerentiation with respect to time for ﬁxed a, P = vn + A ≡ v
is the generalized momentum, and the Hamiltonian of a particle h being a function
of momentum P and coordinate R is given by the standard expression:

˙P = −

˙R =

h =

,

i.e., coincides with the Bernoulli ”invariant”.

The ﬁrst equation of the system (20) is the equation of motion (14), written in

terms of a and t, and the second equation coincides with (18).

For new hydrodynamics (14) or for its Hamilton version (20) it is possible to

formulate a ”new” Kelvin theorem (it is also the Liouville theorem):

where integration is taken along a loop moving together with the ”ﬂuid”. Hence,
analogously as it was made before while derivation of (3) we get the expression for
a new Cauchy invariant:

Its diﬀerence from the original Cauchy invariant (3) consists in that in the equation
of motion (18) instead of the velocity v stands its normal component vn. As conse-
quence, the ”new” hydrodynamics becomes compressible: div vn 6= 0. Therefore on

the Jacobian J of the mapping (19) there are imposed no restrictions. The Jacobian
J can take arbitrary values.

From the formula (22) it is easily to get the expression for the vorticity Ω in the

given point r at the instant t (compare with [2, 7]):

Ω(r, t) =

(Ω(a) · ∇a)R(a, t)
J

,

(23)

where J is the Jacobian of the mapping (19) equal to

J =

∂(x1, x2, x3)
∂(a1, a2, a3)

.

Here we took into account that the generalized momentum P coincides with the
velocity v, including the moment of time t = 0: P0(a) ≡ v0(a). Ω0(a) in this
relation is the ”new” Cauchy invariant with zero divergence: divaΩ0(a) = 0.

The representation (23) generalizes the relation (5) to an arbitrary topology of
vortex lines. The variables a in this expression can be considered locally as a set of
λ, µ and s.

As known (see, for instance, [7]), expression for the Cauchy invariant can be
obtained from the Weber transformation. This is the representation of velocity in
terms of the initial data which can be obtained by integrating the Cauchy invariant
(23).

Consider the following one-form ω = (P · dR) and calculate its time derivative.

By means of the equations of motion (20) we get:

Hence it follows that the vector function

dependent on t and a, will obey the following equation of motion:

Integration of this equation in time gives the Weber-type transformation:

uk(a, t) = uk0(a) +

∂Φ

where the potential Φ satisﬁes the nonstationary Bernoulli equation:

If Φ|t=0 = 0 then the time independent vector u0(a) coincides with the initial
velocity v0(a). By applying the operator curl to the relation (24) we arrive again
at the Cauchy invariant (22).

Thus, in the general situation the equation of motion of vortex lines has the

form (18) which is completed by the relation (23) and the equation

Ω(r, t) = rotrv(r, t)

(25)

with additional constraint divrv(r, t) = 0.

The equations of motion (18), (25) together with the relation (23) can be con-
sidered as the result of partial integration of the Euler equation (1). These new
equations are resolved with respect to the Cauchy invariants – an inﬁnite number
of integrals of motion, that is a very important issue for numerical integration (see
[5, 6]). For the partially integrated system the Cauchy invariants conserve auto-
matically that, however, for direct numerical integration of the Euler equation one
needs to test in which extent these invariants remain constant. Probably, this is one
of the main restrictions deﬁning accuracy of discrete algorithms of direct integration
of the Euler equations.

Another very important property of the vortex line representation is absence
of any restrictions on the value of the Jacobian J which do exist, for instance, for
transition from the Eulerian description to the Lagrangian one in the original Euler
equation (1) when Jacobian in the simplest situation is equal to unity. The value
1/J for the system (18), (25), (23) has a meaning of a density n of vortex lines.
This quantity as a function of r and t , according to (18, obeys the discontinuity
equation:

∂n
∂t

+ divr(nvn) = 0.

(26)

In this equation divrvn 6= 0 because only the total velocity has zero divergence.

5. Consider now the question about application of the VLR to ﬂows of viscous

ﬂuids. Write down the Navier-Stokes equation for vorticity Ω:

∂Ω
∂t

= rot[v × Ω] − ν rot rot Ω,

(27)

and perform in this equation the transform to new variables a and t by means of
changes deﬁned by the equation (18) together with the Cauchy relation (23) where
Ω0 is assumed a function of not only a but also time t: Ω0 = Ω0(a, t).

Then after substitution (23) into (27) the ﬁrst term in the right hand side is

cancelled because of (18). At the result, the equation (27) is written in the form:

1

∂Ω0
∂t

R = −ν rot rot

(cid:27)

Next, change diﬀerentiation relative to r in the r.h.s. of (28) to diﬀerentiation
against a. After simple, but cumbersome calculations the equation (28) transforms

8

into the equation for Ω0(a, t):

Formally it is a linear equation for Ω0, here ˆg is the metric tensor equal to

gαβ =

∂xi

.

The equation (29) for the Cauchy invariant formaly coincides with that ob-
tained by Zenkovich and Yakubovich for incompressible hydrodynamics [8] in which
the variables a are assumed to be Lagrangian markers of ﬂuid particles.
In the
Zenkovich-Yakubovich equation the Jacobian J is proposed to be independent on
time, in the simplest case equal to 1. Just this is a principle diﬀerence between the
Zenkovich-Yakubovich equation and the equation (29). J in (29) is a function of
time t and coordinates a.

Remarkable peculiarity of the obtained system is the exact separation of two dif-
ferent temporal scales, responsible for the inertial (in fact, nonlinear) processes and
for the viscous processes. The former ones are described by the equation (18), and
the latter by the equation of diﬀusive type (29) in which the diﬀusion ”coeﬃcient”,
proportional to viscosity ν, is deﬁned by the metric of the mapping r = R(a, t).

Abstract

A simple variational Lagrangian is proposed for the time develop-
ment of an arbitrary density matrix, employing the ”factorization” of
the density. Only the ”kinetic energy” appears in the Lagrangian.
The formalism applies to pure and mixed state cases, the Navier-
Stokes equations of hydrodynamics, transport theory, etc.
It recap-
tures the Least Dissipation Function condition of Rayleigh-Onsager
and in practical applications is ﬂexible. The variational proposal
is tested on a two level system interacting that is subject, in one in-
stance, to an interaction with a single oscillator and, in another, that
evolves in a dissipative mode.

Introduction

Several basic aspects of stochastic dynamics remain controversial. (A critical
”state of art” update in [1] shows this). This situation contrasts with most
physical theories, where the problems that arise are in the application of
consensually accepted principles. It can perhaps be argued, that the lack of
an agreed-upon variational formulation of stochastic processes is at the root
of the problem. As a remedy of this situation, this article suggests a new
variational functional which is to be minimized and whose minimum is the
true density matrix.

To be sure, in the past several principles of extrema have been proposed;
these include Gauss’s Least Constraint Principle [2, 3], the ”least dissipation

1

function” [4, 5, 6], minimum entropy production-rate for steady states [7, 8]
(see also [9] for its violation), minimal energy generation rate [10], minimal
scattering integral ([11] - [13]), least velocity error during pathway [3], the
Yasue Action for stochastic mechanics [14], a formulation involving a poten-
tial [15], and again, recently, maximum entropy production [16]. To these
may be added several variational methods applicable to classical (i.e., not
quantal) systems, such as those appropriate for general non-linear problems
[17], the ”governing principle for Dissipative Processes” [18, 19] and a gen-
eralized Hamiltonian principle [20]. Reviews of these and of other methods
can be found in [21] - [24].

The present proposal for a variational procedure is based on the follow-
ing new elements: (a) the factorization (to be discussed later in this paper)
of the density matrix as introduced by Reznik [25] and utilized recently by
Gheorghiu-Svirschevski [16], (b) a conventional Lagrangian similar to that
used in Mechanics to obtain the motion of a point particle subject to an ex-
ternal force, but in which the scalar potential is either absent or ignorable,
(c) a vector potential that can be singular, without this having disastrous
observational consequences and (d) an appropriate use of minimization pro-
cedure, with origins going back to Gibbs [2]. The method covers a broad
range of behaviors (”deterministic” and stochastic, quantal and classical,
electronic transport, discrete and continuous, markovian and otherwise) and
places in a new perspective certain aspects in currently employed theories of
stochastic dynamics. Apart from these favorable (and a priori unexpected)
features, a number of problems remain, which will have to be resolved by
future eﬀorts.

A pure state sub-case, (as opposed to a density matrix that can de-
scribe a statistical mixture of states) is the subject of a numerically worked
out example in section 4.1 and is equivalent to the (linear) time dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. For this several variational formulations are known in
the literature ([26] -[31]). The inter-relation between these was investigated
in [30], where they were shown to be frequently equivalent. For the pure
state case our density matrix variational method reduces to the McLachlan
formalism [27], in which the variation of the function is carried out with
respect to the time-derivative only (while the function is kept ﬁxed). More-
over, we give a justiﬁcation of this procedure for stochastic processes.

Another application of the variational formalism, in section 4.2, includes
a non-linear, dissipative (non-Hermitian) mechanism and exempliﬁes quan-
tum jumps.

2 The Variation

The ”factorized” form of the time dependent density matrix ρ ([25],[16])
reads in terms of the column and row vectors γ and (its hermitian conjugate)
γ+

ρ = γγ+

(1)

The above condensed notation is not trivially simple, so we give in Appendix
A a ”tutorial” on the notation. We now propose an action S(T ) (expressed
in arbitrary units) this being the integral over time t with an arbitrary time
end-point T of a Lagrangian
. It is the form of the Lagrangian that we
L
seek: we propose that it has the ”quadratic” form, as follows.

The variational equations based on the above action (these are the equations
of motions for γ and γ+) are given below in equation (7) . Tr is the trace
over all ”components” of γ explained in Appendix A. Dots above symbols
represent diﬀerentiation with time.

The variational equations are obtained in the usual way by varying the

Thus

and a similar expression for δγ+S(T ). The last term, outside the integral,
is the boundary term. It is assumed that the vectors γ are ﬁxed initially
at t = 0, but not at any time later. (This will be discussed shortly.) If the
boundary term can be made to vanish, then so will be the whole variation,
(t)
since in the absence of a scalar potential, the variations δ

δγ+
vanish. This follows, since for the postulated form of the Lagrangian these
variations contain as a factor one or the other of the expressions δ
and
δ ˙γ+ and these vanish due to the boundary variation. (In fact, δ
δ
δ
δγ+ also vanish due to the presence of the same factors, but these variations
L
do not form a suﬃciently general basis for the variation procedure, since the
vector potential A may not be a function of all components of the γ-vector.)
At this point the role of the boundary term is well worth reﬂecting
upon. It is not present in, e.g., deterministic Mechanics, where the values

of the variables are ﬁxed at both end points. However, it is well known
that the boundary term arises when the value of the variant quantity, i.e.
γ, is undetermined at a boundary. This is (physically) the case when a
random force operates on the system. Thus, we are not allowed to neglect
the boundary term.
It is now a further ”bonus” in the formalism, that
the vanishing of the boundary-term variation does not interfere with the
vanishing of the body terms-variation, (i.e., it is neither contradictory to
it nor incomplete with respect to it), but is by virtue of our choice of the
Lagrangian precisely identical with it.

In summary, we have the variational equations

and these make the action extremal (and an absolute minimum) also when
the ”vector potential”1 A is a function of γ [32].[To see this, note the remark
after equation (7) ] This has the immediate consequence that in the expan-
sion of the Lagrangian, shown in equation (2) , the following expression
needs to be minimized:

′DF ′ = ˙γ+ ˙γ

i[ ˙γ+A

·

A+ term is independent of time-derivatives and
This follows, since the A
is not varied. We further note that (by the form of the vector potential)
i times the square bracket is a real quantity. The quantity in the above
equation is essentially of the form of Onsager and Machlup’s Dissipation
Function [the negative of eq. (4-25) in [5]. One recalls that their Dissipation
Function is also minimized only with respect to the time derivatives of the
variables just as in the procedure proposed in [27] and in the present work].
To bring our ’DF’ precisely to the form of the Dissipation Function, we
need to go from our variables γ and γ+ by a constant linear transformation
1We have named our frequently used quantity A the ”vector potential”, in analogy
with the quantity that enters as a cross-term with the time derivative (”the particle
velocity”) in the Lagrangean of classical mechanics [32], or inside the square with the
canonical momentum and in distinction from the scalar potential φ, which appears in
(non-relativistic) Lagrangeans as a separate term.

(not necessarily a unitary one) to the variables α of [5]. One will then get,
instead of the diagonal form ˙γ+ ˙γ, a non-diagonal form which deﬁnes the
”generalized resistance matrix” Rij of [3, 6].
[Since the use of extensive
variables is to be preferred to intensive ones (and γ and γ+ are of the latter
type) the transformation should include the system size. Alternatively, the
action integral may be premultiplied by a size-dependent scale factor.]

Thus, the result of the variation are a set of equations:

˙γ = iA

˙γ+ =

iA+

−

(7)

(8)

When A and A+ are functions of γ and γ+, their (non-zero) derivatives
iA or ˙γ+ + iA+ as factors and these factors vanish
come in with either ˙γ
due to the above equations.

[We can illustrate this in the case of two components, for which we write

the Lagrangian in equation (1) as

(t) = f +

A1(γk, γ+

action is zero.

(9)

Since all the terms contain one of the f -factors or their time derivatives
(which are necessarily also zero) the above equation is satisﬁed for the pro-
posed variational solution. There may be other solutions, though!
If for
these not all f -s are zero (and therefore diﬀer from the proposed solution),
than the action (which consists of positive terms) is positive and larger than
that for the solution given in equation (7) .]

These are the equations of motion of the (independent) vector variables
and can be regarded as having the status of the Langevin equations, or
Hamilton’s equations for the set of conjugate variables γa and γ+
a . The
processes considered in this section comprise a purely Hamiltonian process
AH (namely, energy preserving, ”elastic”) as well as some other, dissipa-
tive mechanisms. Thus, a Markovian scattering process represented by the

5

symbol Mba (designating half the probability per unit time of a scattering
event taking the system from state a to b) can be written as (Aout, Ain) to
separate scattering out of and into a given state. We also add a stochastic,
random process arising from, e.g., an external source, as Ar. Some other
type of processes will be considered below in section 5.

When we add to these the random force, we obtain in addition

fa represent the components of the random time-dependent force with zero
mean and a ﬁnite self-correlation. (N is the number of states in the ensemble,
see appendix A)

The vector potential Ain is singular. However, singularities in vector
potentials are well known (as, e.g., in those for solenoidal or monopole ﬁelds).
To cancel these singularities we shall follow the procedure of Reznik [25]
and Gheorghiu-Svirshevski [16], who multiply γ+ into ˙γ, γ into ˙γ+, add and
obtain the (master) equations for the density matrix.

After substituting the quantities from equations (7,10,11) we obtain by

this procedure for a diagonal element (say) aa of the density matrix

potentials. For a macroscopic system these singularities cancel, when one
takes into account the phase decoherence between diﬀerent states of macro-
scopic bodies. (The subject of microscopic to macroscopic transitions does
not belong here. It was studied by various methods and has summaries in
e.g. [33, 34].)

3 Potential Fluid Dynamics

An interesting application of the preceding complex factor-density formal-
ism is for the well known potential ﬂow (namely, ﬂuid dynamics without
If a
vorticity) as presented in many hydrodynamic text books, e.g., [35].
ﬂow satisﬁes the condition of zero vorticity, i.e. the velocity ﬁeld ~v is such
that ~

~v = 0, then there exists a function φ satisfying ~v = ~
∇

In this section we answer the question: what form of the vector potential
A appearing in equation (2) will ensure, that upon variation of the action
containing these vector potentials we shall obtain precisely the well known
equations of potential ﬂow hydrodynamics. These equations are:

In these equations the physical meaning of the quantities is that ρ is the
mass density, h is the speciﬁc enthalpy, ν is the viscosity coeﬃcient and
Φ is some function representing the potential of an external force acting
on the ﬂuid. The ﬁrst of these equations is the continuity equation, while
the second is a modiﬁed Bernoulli’s equation which takes into account some
viscous eﬀects (A full viscous ﬂow is of course not a potential ﬂow and
contains vorticity) . ρ and φ play the roles of the squared-amplitude and of
the phase angle, respectively. Both are real quantities.

The ﬁnal results for the desired vector potentials and their complex con-
jugates are shown, below, in equation (23) and equation (24) . To obtain
them, we ﬁrst express the variational variables γ and γ+ that we have used
so far in terms of the physical variables (ρ, φ). The variation will now be
carried out with respect to the latter variables. The transformation is

Though all variables are now functions of the positions, and are thus con-
tinuous variables, we shall label them, as before, by the subscripts a, etc.

simply from the inverse transformation:

We can solve for the two quantities, ˙γaγ+

time derivatives. However, by equation (2) the time derivatives are just the
vector potentials. Thus we ﬁnally obtain

(13) and equation (14) . It is evident that the complex representation is a
natural way to obtain variationally equations of motion for two such dissim-
ilar quantities as amplitude and velocity. The physical extrema are certainly
global minima (although the functional may have additional minima). De-
tailed applications will be undertaken in the future including the problem
of a general viscous ﬂow.

4 Applications

4.1 A Periodically Varying Hamiltonian

We shall now apply the proposed variational procedure to yield, in one case
exactly and in another case approximately, the solution for a (hermitian)
Hamiltonian that has a periodic variation. The cases chosen are such that
analytical solutions are known exactly ([37]-[39]), so that we can compare to
them the variational solutions to be obtained here. Speciﬁcally, we consider
the time development of a doublet subject to a Schr¨odinger equation whose
Hamiltonian in a doublet representation is

H(t) = G/2

cos(ωt) sin(ωt)

sin(ωt)

Here ω is the angular frequency of an external disturbance. The eigenvalues
G
of equation (25) are G

is unity. m takes integral values between the limits and we have taken for our
trial functions M = 2, that is six terms in each component. The half integer
in the exponent is suggested by the acquisition of a Berry phase after a full
period 2π
ω . For the same reason we have taken the range of the integration
in equation (2) to be twice the period. So as to create realistic conditions
for the implementation of the variational procedure, we have chosen a ﬁnite
range for the time variable, although, as can be seen from the formulae in
equation (26) and equation (27) , for a general value of G the solution is
not time-periodic. We illustrate the procedure for two cases.

4.1.1 A periodic case

This comes about when G is such that the Rabi frequency K in equation
(27) and ω are commensurate. We have chosen G = √15ω, so that K = 2ω.

Minimizing the action with respect to the coeﬃcients subject to the
normalizing conditions turns out to be equivalent to diagonalizing a twelve-
by-twelve matrix, whose elements are the action integral computed with the
circular function shown in equation (28) . There are twelve-by-twelve matrix
elements, rather than just six-by-six, since the upper and lower states are
coupled by the oﬀ-diagonal terms in equation (25) .

We ﬁnd a pair of zero eigenvalues (actually eigenvalues of about 10−

15),

10

Figure 2: Same as in the previous ﬁgure but for the imaginary part of the
amplitudes.

whose meaning is the value of the action integral in the transformed represen-
tation; in other words, our variational solution is exact. Also, the numerical
values of the variationally obtained coeﬃcients Au
g agree with those in the
analytic solution in equation (26) . For comparison,the other eigen solutions
have ”eigenvalues” of orders 1-20.

4.1.2 A non-periodic case

With the choice of e.g., G = 3 and K = √10
2 , the analytic solution shown
in equation (26) is not periodic and an exact solution cannot be achieved
variationally while having a ﬁnite t-range in the action integral. Moreover,
a larger spread of the basic set in equation (28)
is needed. Still, so as to
estimate the eﬃcacy of the variational procedure under non-optimal condi-
tions, we used the same t-range and the same set size as in (a). The lowest
eigenvalues (= the values of the action integral) are about 0.35, compared
with others eigenvalues, which are again in the range of 1-20.

The results are also shown graphically, by comparing the variational so-
lution (full lines) with the exact, analytic solution (broken lines) in equation
(26)
for real and imaginary parts in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. The
similarities are quite good for the ﬁrst half (that comprises the period of
the Hamiltonian), but is worse in the second half and further deteriorates
later, say in the time range ( 4π
ω ). On the other hand, had we taken the

ω , 6π

11

time range of the variational procedure (the upper limit of integration T in
equation (2) ) up to 6π
ω , we would have obviously got a somewhat diﬀerent
solution, which would have improved the approximation in the latter range
and spoiled somewhat the agreement in the earlier range. In general, the
approximate solution depends on the time-range of the action. In our view,
this endows a ﬂexibility to the practical application of the method, in the
sense that, depending on which time range is of interest, better approxima-
tion can be achieved for that range. Of course, when the ”approximate”
solution is identical with the true solution in some range, it will remain so,
by analytical continuation, for all ranges.

In conclusion, one notes a successful application of the variational princi-
ple for a purely hermitian case, whose solution, though available by algebra,
is not trivial.

4.2 A Non-linear Evolution

The continuous passage of an initially prepared pure state to transitions
resembling quantum jumps was recently studied in [40], based on a form
of the Liouville-von Neumann-Lindblad (LvNL) equation. The actual form
used originated in a representation of fast level crossing in molecular sys-
tems involving two states [41]. It was noted in [40] that the factorization
formalism, called the” square root operator” method of [25], represents an
alternative way of showing how a dissipative term in the Hamiltonian can
cause decoherence. To apply our variational formalism to this case, we ﬁrst
formulate the evolution equations in the factorization scheme and solve the
resulting equations (this is done (A) below) and, secondly, we obtain an ap-
proximation to the solution by minimizing the action with respect to some
parameters appearing in the assumed γ’s (this is carried out in (B)).

4.2.1 Decoherence by the ”square root operator” method

The vector potentials consisting of a Hamiltonian and a dissipative (non-
Hermitian) part are now written for the two factors (γ1, γ2) of the density
matrix as

One notices the similarity of these expressions with the corresponding for-
mulae in [41] and [40] (where the interpretation of the terms is spelt out) and
also the divisor γ on the extreme right, characteristic of the factorization
formalism for dissipative processes, equation (10) . The trace of the density
(ρ = γγ+) stays constant during the motion and this property is maintained
unchanged also by the superlinear terms which enter with the coeﬃcient µ.
It may be noted that the equations of motions for γ1(t) and γ2(t) and of
their conjugates, given in equation (7) , lead to the master equations for the
matrix elements of the density operator. For the diagonal elements these
are of the LvNL form (when µ = 0), but not for the non-diagonal ones. This
property has already been noticed in [25].

We next solve two equations for the γ′s, subject to the pure state initial
conditions γ1 = 1, γ2 = 0 at t = 0, then form from the solutions the diagonal
matrix elements of the density matrix and ﬁnally show the results in ﬁgure
3. The quantity changed between the upper three drawings is the strength
Γ of the dissipative term. As this increases, a transition takes place from
the slow to the fast decoherence regime. We note the remarkable similarity
of the results obtained here by the factorization method to those in Figure
1 of the above articles, except that for strong dissipation their drawings
show little oscillations, unlike our third drawing from above. In this, drawn
for Γ
ω = 20, after a very steep initial slope (not visible in the ﬁgure), both
diagonal density matrix elements oscillate about the asymptotic value of 1
2 .
The majority of calculations whose results are shown in this section are
carried out for a density matrix referring to an ”assembly” consisting of one
system. This means that in Appendix A, one has N = 1 and the summation
over α in equation (34) is trivial. We have also worked the density matrices
when there is a non-trivial summation, namely when initial conditions on the

instead of having only γ1(0) = 1 (and N = 1), as before. The resultant
density tends now to an almost perfectly straight line. This is similar to the
graphs shown in both [41] and in [40] for strong dissipation and elucidates
the meaning of system-averaging in the density matrix. (In more complex
systems, one would require an averaging in the density matrix over a much
larger number of states, such that N
.) We have also worked out the
N = 4 case for the upper three graphs in ﬁgure 3. For these graphs, there
was hardly any perceptible change from those shown.

we do not delve here into the details or extensions of the results, but turn
to the variational treatment of time-development to be got from minimizing
the action.

4.2.2 Solving variationally

We note that the strongly oscillatory factor in the solution arises from the
driving term G
2 cos(ωt) and that this term was already present in the Hamil-
tonian case considered in the previous subsection, in equation (26) . (We
have, however, eliminated there the fast oscillating factor by subtracting
from the Hamiltonian the so-called dynamic-phase.) So in this subsection
we shall put G = 0, which also makes the numerical aspect of the variation
considerably simpler. We then set up pair of suitable trial γ(t)’s, containing
parameters to be varied.

In contrast to the previous subsection (which was a linear problem and
in which a large number of Fourier coeﬃcients were varied), in the present
problem only one variational parameter (v) is introduced. However, to make
progress, we must consider critical regions of the time domain, namely t = 0
. At the former, it is easy to see that in order that the singularity
and t =
due to the zero divisor γ+
2(0) in the vector potential be matched by the
time derivative of γ2(t) at t = 0, this function must take there the form of

∞

with the constant phase angle β arbitrary. Similarly, it can be shown that,
asymptotically for large t, the same solution must have the form

or some other form equivalent to this. A constant phase factor was ignored
here. The parameter v cannot be found from the equations of motion. We
seek to obtain the variationally best v, such that the condition at t = 0 is
also satisﬁed. After some elementary algebra on ﬁnds that in terms of the
variational parameter, the density factor γ2 can have the form,

The previously introduced phase β was varied independently and found to
be small. So we put β = 0. The other density factor γ1(t) was so constructed
that the exponentials inside the square root had the opposite signs to those

Minimizing the action integral for a set of parameter values for J and

the variational
solution (thin continuous curve, with v =
.78) and the solution from the
equation of motion (thick continuous curve). In the asymptotic regime of
large t, the behavior of the two curves is quite similar, though the amplitude
of oscillation is clearly smaller in the variational solution than in the exact
solution. The discrepancy appears the more serious in that a diﬀerent choice
0.98, (also shown in the ﬁgure
of the variational parameter, namely v =
by broken lines), which has an action larger than the optimized one, comes
nearer to the exact solution. However, we show in the inset that in the
extremely short time region, the optimized solution is qualitatively better
than the other choice. Because of the singular behavior of the short time
region in the vector potential, this region dominates the value of the action.
At the same time, yet another choice of the parameter v =
0.05, (shown
in the ﬁgure by dotted lines) gives a deﬁnitely poorer resemblance to the
correct curve.

In conclusion, when it comes to describe subtle quantum mechanical en-
semble properties, the factorization (or ”square root operator”) method can
be used either in its equation of motion form or variationally. In the present
case, at least, the equation of motion approach was from a numerical view-
point undoubtedly superior. So one may question the use of the variational
method. However, on the one hand not all problems may be easily solvable.
On the other hand, one should remember that the derivation of the equation
of motion in equation (7) is itself based on a variational ansatz introduced
in this paper.

5 Further Extensions

To treat non-Markovian processes, the vector potentials have to be functions
of the γ vectors at earlier times, but otherwise, no change in the formalism
is needed.

Non-negativity of the entropy-change follows from the master equations
and properties of the scattering probabilities Mba in equation (12) , as is
shown in [42].

Transport processes can be treated simply. Thus, let us consider elec-
tronic conduction in a solid due to a spatial gradient in the potential (i.e.,
an electric ﬁeld) or in the ambient temperature. The γ vectors are, nor-
mally, labeled by the reciprocal, k-vector index and are essentially small
deviations from the square root of the equilibrium, Fermi-Dirac electronic
distribution function. Following the standard treatment given in, e.g., [13],
the time derivatives of the γ vectors (that are now real and identical to γ+)
are proportional to the spatial gradients. The vector potentials represent the
scattering integral. Then either equation of motion in equation (7) is simply
the Boltzmann equation in an inhomogeneous form; namely, its left hand
side represents the source or the gradient and the right hand side contains
the desired distribution function under the integral over all wave-vectors.
The Lagrangian can be used to obtain the solution variationally. This vari-
ational formulation is, however, diﬀerent from those given in [11, 13]. (Of
course, diﬀerent variational procedures can lead to the same result.)

We have noted earlier that the postulated Lagrangian does not contain
a potential. Adding a potential to the Lagrangian might apparently change
the equations of motion. It seems to us, however, that under conditions pre-
vailing in stochastic processes, this will not happen. The reason for this can
be stated in various forms and is rooted in the circumstance (already noted
above) that in the presence of a random force one has no control over the
value of the variables, only on its rate of change. (”Free terminal endpoint”
condition of [3], p. 9.) In Appendix B we give a formal proof for the follow-
ing proposition: ”When the following conditions hold: (a) the potential is
a non-negative quadratic form in all of its variables (the γ’s), (b) the vector
potentials A are all real and positive, (c) the initial values of the γ vectors
are suitably chosen, and (d) the variation is performed under conditions of
ﬁxed initial values of γ and ˙γ, then it follows that the action obtained from
the variation of the velocities only, i.e., with the potential regarded as ignor-
able, is less than the action obtained from the variation of both the variables
and their derivatives (namely, through the usual Lagrange equations, which
are obtained under ﬁxed initial and ﬁnal boundary conditions).” The result
holds probably under a wider range of conditions, since in the proof we have
not utilized the requirement imposed on the self-correlation of the random
forces fa by the ”second” theorem of Mori [43]. (This requirement ensures,
among other things, the time-shift invariance of the random process which

18

is at the root of the Onsager-Machlup theory [5, 6]. Needless to say, that
the result obtained in Appendix A is not in conﬂict with the validity of the
Euler-Lagrange equations, since these are obtained under conditions that
the variables have ﬁxed values at the ﬁnal time.

6 Conclusion

The variational action (or Lagrangian) proposed in equation (2) for dynam-
ical processes has the advantages of being simple, general and ﬂexible. It
diﬀers from previously employed variational procedures by the factorization
ansatz in equation (1) , by the absence of a scalar potential term and the
presence of a variable ﬁnal time upper limit. The relation of the postulated
Lagrangian to some basic invariance property (like ”frame indiﬀerence” [44])
remains to be explored, account being taken of the fact that, for vector po-
tentials that are not all equal, the formalism is non-Abelian (namely, the
vector potentials cannot be transformed away by a single gauge factor)[45].

A A Tutorial on the Factorized Density Matrix

Formalism.

·

Though the factorized density matrix, written in an abstract form as ρ =
γ+, has been employed before in [25] and [16], we shall explain its formal-
γ
ism here, following Band’s introductory texts to the von Neumann matrix
method ([46],[47]). Let Ψα be a possible wave function describing the quan-
tum state of the α’th system in the ensemble (α = 1, 2...N ).
It can be
expanded in terms of a set of eigenstates un as

Ψα =

γα
n un

n
X

(33)

19

As derived in [46] and other texts, the density matrix arises from the en-
semble average over all systems in the sense that its nm component is

ρnm =

n γα+
γα
m

1
N

α
X

The γα’s are best viewed as row vectors, distinct for each α (or system)
and the γα+’s as column vectors. The γ- and γ+- derivatives in the text
n and γα+
(which implement the variation procedure) are with respect to γα
m .
The ensemble averaging, namely the summing over α and the subsequent
division by N , is not explicitly written out in the text, but is designated by
inserting a dot between γ symbols, so that the previous matrix element is
written as

ρnm = γn

γ+
m

·

It is clear that the γ’s are not vector quantities, but the traces over the
dotted products are proper scalars.

B Proof of the minimal action under one-point

boundary condition

Assumptions: In the action, equation (2) , the vector potential A is now as-
sumed to be positive (non-negative) and real. We shall further subtract from
the action (see below) a potential term, in which the potential V depends
on the variables only, not on their derivatives. This potential is supposed
to be monotonic, non-decreasing and positive in the relevant range of its
variables.

We start the proof for a single time dependent variable g which replaces

the earlier complex variable γ through

˙g = ˙g(t) =

i ˙γ

−

The reality of g for all times will be evident. The one-point (initial time)
boundary conditions ﬁx g(0) and ˙g(0), while g(t) at later times develops
according to its equation of motion. We write the action, including the
potential, in the single variable g as

The boundary conditions ﬁx the value of g(0) > 0 and of ˙g(0). We next min-
imize the above action in two ways and subsequently compare the resulting
actions. The ﬁrst is the usual Lagrange equation way in the presence of a
potential V and the quantities arising from this method will be denoted by
the superscript V . The second method pretends that there is no potential
and the corresponding quantities will take the superscript 0. It is the second
method that was used in the text.

where the prime represents the derivative with respect to the argument g.

The latter equation imposes the following initial condition for the velocities:

¨gV (t) = ˙A(t)

˙g0(t) = A(t)

˙g0(0) = A(0)
= ˙gV (0)

(38)

˙gV (t) = A(t)

where P (t) is zero at t = 0 and is for positive times non-negative, since it
is, by equation (38) , the time integral of a positive quantity. Subtracting
˙g0 shown in equation (39) from the last equation and integrating, it is clear
that gV never exceeds (algebraically) g0. Calculating the actions obtained
in the two methods and subtracting we ﬁnd:

SV (T ) =

dt[( ˙gV

A(t))2

2V (gV (t))] =

dt[P (t)2

2V (gV (t))]

In the integrand the squared term is necessarily positive (non-negative) and
so is the term containing the diﬀerence of potentials since the 0-argument
is larger than the V-argument and the potential is monotonic by supposi-
tion. Though obtained under restricted conditions, the result shows clearly

21

that the two-point boundary conditions are necessary requisites for the va-
lidity of the Lagrange-Euler equations of motion. Generalization to several
(real) variables g1, g2, ..., gN is immediate, when the potential is a positive
quadratic form in these variables, since this can be diagonalized (with posi-
tive eigenvalues) simultaneously with the kinetic energy term. However, the
initial point variables need to be chosen carefully in this case.

Finally, we have not proven that the action using equations of motion of
the text is minimal, but only that is lower than that obtained with the (for
this case, inappropriate) use of the Lagrange equations. Furthermore, it is
not evident that the solutions obtained in this Appendix satisfy conditions
required from density matrices or probabilities (e.g., normalizations).

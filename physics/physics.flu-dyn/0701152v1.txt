‡

We investigate the dynamo problem in the limit of small magnetic Prandtl number (Pm) using a
shell model of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The model is designed to satisfy conservation laws
of total energy, cross helicity and magnetic helicity in the limit of inviscid ﬂuid and null magnetic
diﬀusivity. The forcing is chosen to have a constant injection rate of energy and no injection of
kinetic helicity nor cross helicity. We ﬁnd that the value of the critical magnetic Reynolds number
(Rm) saturates in the limit of small Pm. Above the dynamo threshold we study the saturated regime
versus Rm and Pm. In the case of equipartition, we ﬁnd Kolmogorov spectra for both kinetic and
magnetic energy except for wave numbers just below the resistive scale. Finally the ratio of both
dissipation scales (viscous to resistive) evolves as Pm−3/4 for Pm < 1.

1 Introduction

Most of astrophysical bodies possess or have had in their history their own
magnetic ﬁelds. In most cases their generation rely on inductive processes
produced by the turbulent motion of the electroconducting ﬂuid within the
body [1]. An important parameter of the problem is the magnetic Prandtl
number deﬁned by Pm = ν/η where ν is the viscosity and η the magnetic
diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid. In the “magnetic” universe Pm varies from values as
6 for
large as 1014 for the interstellar medium [2] to values as small as 10−
the iron core of planets or stellar plasmas. This large spectrum of possible
Pm values implies strong diﬀerences between possible generation mechanisms.
In some sense Pm is a measure of the kinetic energy spectrum available for

generating magnetic energy. When Pm
1 the resistive scale is smaller than
the viscous scale implying that all velocity scales are available for generating
some magnetic ﬁeld. In the other hand for Pm < 1, only the velocity scales
larger than the resistive scale are available for the magnetic ﬁeld generation. In
that case, the velocity scales smaller than the resistive scale are enslaved to the
larger scales and in essence they stay passive in the generation process. Besides
this is why the large eddy simulation technique may be recommended in that
case [3]. Therefore, at ﬁrst sight one can expect that dynamo action is all
the more diﬃcult to obtain since Pm is smaller in reason of a smaller velocity
spectrum available for the magnetic generation. This is indeed what comes out
from recent numerical simulations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (see also [10] and references
therein for an alternative approach). Though, we have evidence of magnetic
ﬁeld in planets and stars, and dynamo action has also been reproduced in
6) [11,
experiments working with liquid sodium for which Pm is small (
12,13,14]. These experiments and further devices in preparation [15,16,17] are
designed in such a way that the dynamo mechanism is produced by the large
scale of the ﬂow due to an appropriate large scale forcing. The turbulence
naturally developing at smaller scales may play a role though this is still
unclear [18, 19, 3, 20, 21]. In these experiments, the choice of the forcing is
based on the hypothesis that it is the stationary part of the large scale ﬂow
which should be important for the generation mechanism. A number of ﬂow
geometries studied in the past turned out to be good candidates for such
experiments [22, 23, 24].

In the present paper we are interested in the possibility for a Kolmogorov
type turbulent ﬂow to generate dynamo action at low Pm, without need for
a large scale motion controlling the generation mechanism. We expect the
eddies having the highest shearing rate to be the more active for generating the
magnetic ﬁeld, at least during the kinematic stage of magnetic ﬁeld growth. As
2/3, these eddies correspond to the smallest
in Kolmogorov turbulence ul/l
available scale which is the viscous scale for Pm
1 [25] and the resistive scale
for Pm < 1 [9]. Eventually the magnetic ﬁeld will then spread out to larger
scales due to the nonlinear interactions. This problem is hard to solve by
direct numerical simulation for it needs high resolution in order to describe
magnetic phenomena adequately [26]. Some results have been obtained using
the EDQNM closure applied to the MHD equations [27] near the critical Rm
and for arbitrary low values of Pm. Here we want to investigate arbitrary large
values of Rm and small values of Pm. For that we use a shell model of MHD
turbulence introduced by Frick and Sokoloﬀ [28]. This model is the successor
of several other shell models for MHD turbulence [29,30,31,32,33,34,35] but it
is the only one to conserve all integrals of motions including magnetic helicity
(or kinetic helicity for the non magnetic case). It is based on the so-called
GOY hydrodynamic shell model [36,37,38,39]. In [28], Frick and Sokoloﬀ have

≥

derived a model which represents either 2D or 3D MHD turbulence, depending
on the choice of two parameters. As in real MHD turbulence the 2D model
leads to the impossibility of dynamo action [40]. This shows that in spite that
such a shell model is a drastic simpliﬁcation of the real MHD turbulence,
ignoring for example the geometrical structures of the motion and magnetic
ﬁeld, it contains enough features to make the diﬀerence between the 2D and 3D
problems (see also [41]). It also reproduces quite well the structure functions at
diﬀerent orders of real MHD turbulence. Here we consider only the 3D model
herein after referred to as FS98. This model has also been used by Lozhkin et
al. [42] to show that small scale dynamo is possible at low Pm, contrary to
the hypothesis put forward by Batchelor [43].

Giulani and Carbone [41] have shown that long runs with the FS98 model
lead inevitably towards a “dynamical alignement” stopping the nonlinear
transfer towards the smaller scales. Giulani and Carbone [41] suggested that
this problem might be overcome with an other choice of the external driving
force. This is what we have done here, adopting a forcing in such a way that it
acts on several scales and depends on time with a random phase at each forc-
ing scale (see section 2.2). Finally, we took care to have long runs well beyond
any transient state, in order to have good statistics and reliable results.

2 Shell model for MHD turbulence

2.1 Model equations

The shell model is built up by truncation of the Navier-Stokes and induction
equations. We deﬁne logarithmic shells, each shell being characterized by one
real wave number kn = k0λn and dynamical complex quantities Un and Bn
representative of the velocity and magnetic ﬂuctuations for wave vectors of
norm ranging between kn and kn+1. The parameter λ is taken equal to the
gold number (1 + √5)/2 for it optimizes the resolution [44]. The model is
described by the following set of equations (0

2.2 Forcing and initial conditions

The forcing is chosen in order to control the injection rate of kinetic energy,
cross and kinetic helicities. For that we spread the forcing on three neighbour-
ing shells nf , nf + 1 and nf + 2 with Fnf +j = fjeiφj , j = 0, 1, 2 where the fj
[0, 2π] are random phases. In
are positive real quantities and where the φj ∈
that case the forcing is δ-correlated. Alternatively we also used a forcing for
which the phases φj are constant during a certain time τc, which can be inter-
preted as a ﬁnite correlation time. In fact this does not make much diﬀerence
either on the autocorrelation functions of Un nor on the subsequent results.
Therefore it is suﬃcient to use random phases. As we are interested to inject

neither kinetic helicity nor cross-helicity, the forcing functions must satisfy

where ε is the rate of kinetic energy supplied to the system. Therefore for a
given set of random φj (j = 0, 1, 2), the fj depend on the Uj and Bj (j = 0, 1, 2)
which expressions are given in Appendix. For some arbitrary initial conditions

until it reaches some statistically stationary state. Then introducing at a given

time some arbitrary non zero values of Bj (j = 0, 1) of small intensity (
we solve the full problem until a statistically stationary MHD state is reached.
The time of integration needed to obtain good statistics depends on ν and η
but typically it is equal to several hundreds of the large scale turn-over time.

has been chosen here for a better representation of the results and is not rele-
vant of the actual time step used for the numerical calculations. The kinetic,
magnetic and total energies have reached a statistical stationary steady state
after a few hundred time steps. The ﬂuctuations of these quantities are quite
important due to the small values of ν and η. The kinetic helicity though
its average is close to zero, shows strong ﬂuctuations. In the other hand the
magnetic helicity stays very small. Finally the relative cross helicity deﬁned
HC/√EU EB oscillates around zero. The fact that this latter quantity does
by
not reach an asymptotic limit of
1 shows that there is no “dynamical aligne-
ment”. Therefore we are conﬁdent that our choice of forcing overcomes the
problem raised by Giulani and Carbone [41].

time the kinetic spectrum is not very smooth at large scales. In the early time,

5/3). Then, as Rm
a slope in k−
is much larger than the critical value of the dynamo instability, the magnetic
energy starts to grow (Fig. 3a). We expect magnetic energy to be initially
ampliﬁed by the eddies having the highest sharing rate, i.e. the smallest scale
eddies. As Pm < 1, the smallest eddies available for dynamo action correspond
to eddies at resistive scale. This is indeed what we ﬁnd, as here, the resistive
scale (deﬁned as in section 2.3) corresponds to log10 kη ∼
4.1. We note that
(ǫ/η3)1/4 (see section 4.3) with
the Kolmogorov resistive scale given by kη ∼
6, leads to a slightly higher value log10 kη ∼
η = 10−

As Rm is suﬃciently large, at subsequent times the magnetic energy reaches
the level of kinetic energy (Fig. 3c). At that time the kinetic spectrum is
not inﬂuenced yet by the nonlinear feedback of the magnetic ﬁeld and is still
2/3. Then the dynamical equilibrium between the magnetic and velocity
in k−
ﬁelds settles down (Fig. 3d). A striking feature of this equilibrium is the change
of slope (from -2/3 to
kη while
the magnetic spectrum is slightly above the kinetic spectrum. We also note
that the viscous dissipation scale has increased (the right part of the kinetic
spectrum drifting to the left). This probably comes from the fact that there

Looking at curve (a) which represents the total ﬂux Πtot(n) versus log10 k,
one can distinguish three plateaus: the ﬁrst one corresponds to scales larger

Now let us have a look at curve (c). The transfer rate ΠU <

U >(n) is responsible
for the direct cascade of kinetic energy and would be constant leading to a
Kolmogorov spectrum if the magnetic ﬁeld was null (see Fig. 1). This would
remain true for a non zero magnetic ﬁeld only if the curve (c) was staying ﬂat
with ΠU <
U >(n) = ǫν for 2 < log10 k < 5.5. In that case the curve (d) would be
ﬂat as well with ΠB<
U >(n)
compensated by a symmetric bump of ΠB<
U >(n) for 2 < log10 k < 4.5. This drop
of ΠU <
2/3. Indeed, the bump
U >(n) is consistent with a spectrum steeper than k−
of ΠB<
U >(n) corresponds to some extra energy taken from ǫ and dissipated by
Joule eﬀect. Then there is less energy to be transferred through the kinetic
energy cascade. The physical reason why this scenario happens for scales just
larger than the resistive scale, however is still unclear.

U >(n) = ǫη for k > 2. Instead, there is a drop of ΠU <

For the parameters of Fig. 5 the Kolmogorov dissipation scales are given by
kη = (ǫ/η3)1/4 = 104.5 and kη = (ǫ/ν3)1/4 = 106.75 which correspond quan-
titatively well with the beginning of the second and third plateau of Πtot(n).
This shows that the arguments leading to the Kolmogorov dissipation scales
(see next section) are not aﬀected by the change of spectra slopes observed in
Fig. 4.

Finally for completeness, we produced three movies showing the time evo-
lution of the spectra of the other quadratic quantities. In u-helicity.mpg, b-
helicity.mpg and cross-helicity.mpg, log10 HU (n), log10 HB(n) and log10 HC(n)
are plotted versus log10 k where the blue and red dots denote positive and neg-
ative signs.

4.3 Dissipation scales ratio

At the end of section 2.3 we have already explained how we identify the viscous
and resistive scales kν and kη, by comparing the turn over time to the respec-
tive dissipative times. In Fig. 6 we plot the ratio kν/kη versus Pm

3/4. To understand why, it is
diﬀerent values of Re. We ﬁnd that kν /kη ∼

4.4 Route to saturation

In this section we study the inﬂuence of Pm on the way the dynamo saturates.
For that we calculate the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy EB/EU , EB
and EU being deﬁned as in (12). In Fig. 7, EB/EU is plotted versus Rm
for three values of Pm. We note that for Rm much larger than the critical
105. Such
value, the level of saturation EB/EU may go beyond 1 for Rm
a super saturation state could be expected from the spectra of Fig. 4. At
the threshold, the slope of EB/EU versus Rm follows a turbulent scaling of
c as expected by P´etr´elis and Fauve [49].

Indeed as in this case the threshold Rmc does not vary very much with Pm, the
slopes at Rm = Rmc are similar. This is to contrast with the laminar scaling

For each value of Pm, the vertical bar around Rmc corresponds to values
of Rm for which the magnetic solution is erratic. In other words, below the
bars there is no dynamo action and above the bars there is a well deﬁne
statistically stationary magnetic solution. In between though we do not observe
intermittency as in [50,51], the dynamo is irregular, the mean magnetic energy
increasing and decreasing versus time.

Of course all these results rely on the assumption that the interactions
between the diﬀerent scales of motion and magnetic ﬁeld are local interactions,
each shell interacting with a few shells above and below. We believe that this
should not make much diﬀerence as long as Pm is small, the Kolmogorov
turbulence being governed by local interaction. In the other hand our results

can not being tested against the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan k−
prediction [52] resulting from non local interactions between the ﬂow and
some large scale magnetic ﬁeld which could result for example from dynamo
3/2 slope in FS98 is due to a lack of
action. By the way we believe that the k−
statistics as can be seen from the energy ﬂuxes which are not ﬂat and from
the corresponding small range of scales. Adding some non local interaction
with a large scale magnetic ﬁeld in a local shell model, Biskamp [34] found a
3/2 slope, though taking only one such a non local interaction is somewhat
k−
artiﬁcial. Recently Verma [53] revisited the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan theory in
which he shows that the large scale magnetic ﬁeld becomes renormalized
due to the nonlinear term, leading back to the Kolmogorov spectrum. This
emphasizes the need for a complete nonlocal shell model in which any shell
could interact with the others. This could be a good test against one theory
or the other. Such a model would be also welcome for simulations at large
Pm. Indeed at large Pm we expect the more energetic scales of the ﬂow,
corresponding to scales close to the viscous scales, to interact directly with the
smaller scales of the magnetic ﬁeld. Our local shell model can not catch such
features and this is why we did not show results at large Pm for they surely
lack physical ground. A further issue that could be addressed by a nonlocal
shell model could be to distinguish between a large scale ﬁeld generated by
a small scale velocity ﬁeld resulting from non local interactions (developed
in the mean ﬁeld formalism) and a large scale ﬁeld generated by an ”inverse
cascade” as for example in Fig. 3 or in [54], resulting from local interactions.
Concerning our local model, we believe that the results presented in Fig. 8
showing that the dynamo threshold does not depend on Pm at low values of
Pm would stay qualitatively the same if additional nonlocal interactions were
included in the model. Indeed the dynamo threshold corresponds to the growth
start of the magnetic ﬁeld which is then still not signiﬁcant. Therefore any non
local interactions (e.g. Alfven sweeping eﬀect) might not change the threshold.

Here we investigate the propagation and scattering of surface water waves by arrays of bottom-
mounted cylindrical steps. Both periodic and random arrangements of the steps are considered.
The wave transmission through the arrays is computed using the multiple scattering method based
upon a recently derived formulation. For the periodic case, the results are compared to the band
structure calculation. We demonstrate that complete band gaps can be obtained in such a system.
Furthermore, we show that the randomization of the location of the steps can signiﬁcantly reduce
the transmission of water waves. Comparison with other systems is also discussed.

Phenomena pertinent to waves in complex media have
been and continue to be a great inspiration for the de-
velopment of scientiﬁc explorations. One of the most im-
portant phenomena is frequency band structures. It pre-
vails when waves propagate through periodically struc-
tured media. Such a phenomenon was ﬁrst investigated
for electrons in solids nearly eighty years ago. The well-
known Bloch theorem has then been proposed and led
to the successful explanation of such important proper-
ties of solids as conductivity, semi-conductivity, and in-
sulating states[1]. Applying these concepts to classical
waves[2, 3] has paved an avenue to the new era of re-
search. Not only all the phenomena previously observed
or discussed only for electronic systems are successfully
transplanted to classical systems, but many more signiﬁ-
cant and novel ideas and applications, such as photonic-
crystal-made negatively-refractive devices[4], have well
gone beyond expectation, and are so far reaching that
a fruitful new ﬁeld has been established, i. e. the ﬁeld
of photonic and acoustic crystals, signiﬁed by the estab-
lishment of a comprehensive archive website[5].

Recently, the consideration of waves in periodic media
has also been deliberately extended to the propagation
of water waves over periodically structured bottoms[6,
7, 8, 9, 10]. Some of the advances have been reviewed,
for example, by McIver[11]. One of the most recent pi-
oneering experiments used water waves to illustrate the
phenomenon of Bloch waves as a result of the modulation
by periodic bottom structures[9]. This experiment made
it possible that the abstract concept be presented in an
unprecedentedly clear manner.

Motivated by the experiments[9],

in this paper we
would like to further explore the propagation of wa-
ter waves through underwater structures. The struc-
tures considered here consist of arrays of cylindrical steps
mounted on a ﬂat bottom. Although there have been
many theoretical approaches for investigating propaga-
tion of water waves over various bottom topographies,

most approaches have been limited to mildly varying bot-
tom structures or their variations[12, 13]. In this paper,
we will use the recently derived theory [14]. The main
reason lies in that the theory was successfully in explain-
ing the experimental observations[15].
In addition, it
has been shown that this approach compares favorably
with existing approximations when applied to some spe-
cial cases considered previously. We will calculate the
wave transmission and band structures for periodically
arranged arrays. Then we will show the eﬀect of posi-
tional disorders on the transmission. The results suggest
that the phenomenon of complete band gaps by anal-
ogy with the photonic crystals is also possible for water
waves. The complete band gaps refer to the frequency
regime where waves cannot propagate in any direction.

Before continuing, it is worth noting here that from
a more general perspective, propagation of water waves
over topographical bottoms has been a subject of much
research from both practical and theoretical aspects since
Lamb[16]. From the practical side, the topic is essential
to many important ocean engineering problems such as
ﬂoating bridges and devices in oﬀshore power stations[11]
A great amount of papers and monographs has been
published[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. A com-
prehensive reference on the topic can be found in two
excellent textbooks[12, 13].

A conceptual layout of the system considered here is
presented in Fig. 1. The water surface is in the x − y
plane. Governing equations for the motion of surface
water waves in such a system can be obtained by invoking
the Newton’s second law and the conservation of mass
by assuming that the water is incompressible. While the
detailed derivation has been given elsewhere [14], here we
just list the ﬁnal equations.

The displacement of the water surface is denoted by

η(~r, t). Its Fourier transformation is

η(~r, t) =

dωe−iωtηω(~r).

Substituting Eqs. (4) and (5) into Eq. (2), we get

Q ~G, ~G′( ~K, ω)Cω( ~G′, ~K) = 0,

X~G′

with
Q ~G, ~G′( ~K, ω) = [( ~G + ~K) · ( ~G′

+ ~K)]Aω( ~G − ~G′

) − δ ~G, ~G′.

The dispersion relation connecting ~K and ω, i. e. the
frequency bands, is therefore determined by the secular
equation

det

( ~G + ~K) · ( ~G′

+ ~K)]Aω( ~G − ~G′

) − δ ~G, ~G′

i ~G, ~G′ = 0.

(7)
Special care has to be taken in solving the above secular
equation, since the initial dispersion relation in Eq. (3)
is non-linear. We use an iterative procedure to ﬁnd the
zero point or the ﬁxed point for the determinant. To
gain conﬁdence with the computation, we have applied
the numerical codes to three special cases for which the
solution is relatively easy to obtain: a ﬂat bottom, steps
in shallow and deep waters. We found that the results
match well the expectations.

First we consider the case of regular arrays. Figure 2
shows the results for the band structures and the trans-
mission of water waves across the arrays of cylindrical
steps. With reference to [9], the following parameters
have been used in the computation: lattice constant d =
2.5mm, cylinder radius a = 0.875mm, depth of the wa-
ter h = 2.5mm. The heights for the steps are 2.49 and
2.40 mm for (a) and (b) respectively. When computing
the transmission, a stimulating source is placed about
one lattice constant away from the arrays whereas the
receiver is located at about half of the lattice constant
away on the other side of the arrays. To ensure the sta-
bility of the results, enough modes and number of steps
have been considered. For instance, the maximum mode
number and the maximum array size considered are 9
and 30×10 respectively. These numbers are considerably
larger than what has been computed previously.

Here it is shown that there is a complete band gap
ranging from 9.6 to 12.3 Hz for the case in (a). The
band structure calculation in(a1) is fully supported by
the independent transmission calculation by the multi-
ple scattering theory. Along the ΓX direction, the band
structure shows that there is a partial frequency gap from
about 15 to 22 Hz. That is, waves whose frequency lies
within the range cannot propagate along this direction.
This partial gap also appears in the transmission calcu-
lation shown by the solid line in (a2). However, the gap
depicted by the transmission calculation seems much nar-
rower than that obtained by the band structure calcula-
tion. We ﬁnd that this is due to the ﬁniteness of the
array. Reasons follows. Since a point source was used to
transmit waves, waves can be radiated to various direc-
tion. Although the propagation along the ΓX direction

form a rectangular array with lattice constant d.

The equation of motion for the Fourier component ηω is
derived as[14]

where ∇ = ∂x~ex + ∂y~ey, and the wavenumber k satisﬁes

ω2 = gk(~r) tanh(k(~r)h(~r)).

For a ﬁxed frequency ω, the wavenumber varies as a func-
tion of the depth h(~r).

Although Eq. (2) can be used for arbitrary topograph-
ical bottoms, in this paper we focus on the cylindrical
steps depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we assume that
all the steps are identical. When there is a stimulating
source, the transmitted waves will be scattered repeat-
edly at the steps, forming an orchestral pattern of multi-
ple scattering. Such a multiple scattering process can be
solved for any arrangement of the steps with help from
the theory devised by Twersky[26]. The wave transmis-
sion can be computed. In the computation, the transmis-
sion is normalized such that it is unity when there are no
scatterers. The details have been presented in [14].

When the steps are regularly placed to form periodic
lattices, the frequency bands will appear and can be de-
termine as follows. By Bloch’s theorem[1], the displace-
ment ﬁeld ηω can be expressed in the following form

ηω(~r) = ei ~K·~r

Cω( ~G, ~K)ei ~G·~r,

(4)

X~G

where ~G is the vector in the reciprocal lattice and ~K
the Bloch vector[1]. In this case, the wavenumber k also
varies periodically and we have the following expression

k2 =

Aω( ~G)ei ~G·~r.

For a ﬁxed ω, the coeﬃcients Aω are determined from
Eqs. (3) and (5).

This phenomenon is surprising, since in the frequency
range concerned, roughly from 28 to 35 Hz, two frequency
bands do show up in diagram (b1). A possible explana-
tion for this ambiguity may be that the two bands are
deaf. Such a deaf-band phenomenon has been recently
observed, for example, in acoustic systems[27] with a fur-
ther support from theoretical computations[28].

FIG. 3: Normalized transmission ln |T |2 versus frequency
for periodic and complete random arrays respectively. In the
random case, the transmission has been averaged over the
random conﬁgurations.

Next we consider the eﬀect of the randomization in
the locations of the steps. For brevity, we only show the
result for the complete random array. That is, the loca-
tions of the cylindrical steps are completely random on
the x − y plane. The only restraints are that no two
steps should overlap with each other, and the averaged
distance between two nearest steps is kept as the same as
in the ordered case, i. e. d = 2.5mm. The transmission
results are shown in Fig. 3. The solid and dotted lines
separately refer to the transmission results for the propa-
gation along the [10] direction in the ordered case and for
the complete random case. At low frequencies, the disor-
der eﬀect is not obvious for the given sample size. In this
regime, the scattering by the steps is week. However, the
transmission is signiﬁcantly reduced in the mid range of
frequency. This observation is in agreement with the case
of acoustic scattering by arrays of rigid cylinders located
in air[14]. For high frequencies, the reduction due to the
disorder is not as signiﬁcant. This is understandable. In
the high frequency range, for example when kh >> 1,
the eﬀect of the steps on the wave propagation tends to
diminish. This can be seen from Eq. (3) which reduces
to ω2 ≈ gk in the high frequency regime.

In summary, we have considered water wave propaga-
tion over bottom-mounted cylindrical steps. We found
that complete band gaps can appear in such a system
in analogy with that in the photonic or sonic crystals.
The results also suggest that there might be deaf-band

is prohibited in the presence of the partial gap, the radi-
ation into other directions may still have the chance to
arrive at the receiver, thus complicating the observation
of the partial gap.

We also ﬁnd that the band structures and the trans-
mission are very sensitive to the arrangement and the
height of the steps. As an example, in Fig. 2(b) we
show the results for the same lattice array as in (a) ex-
cept that we change the height of the steps from 2.49
mm to 2.40 mm. This slight change causes a dramatic
change in band structure. The complete band gap disap-
peared. There are two partial gaps located at 20 and 45
Hz respectively along the ΓX direction. Within these two
gaps, the transmission is inhibited, as evidenced by the
two leftward valleys on the solid line in (b2). Compared
to the situation in (a), the transmission data match the
band structures better for the partial gaps.

We notice that there are two inhibited transmission
valleys along the ΓM direction from the multiple scat-
tering calculation, referring to the dotted line in (b2).

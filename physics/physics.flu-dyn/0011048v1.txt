Abstract

In this paper we examine the data that was collected at Haley Station in Antarctica

on June 22, 1987. Using a test devised by Dewan [9] we interpret the ﬂow as one which

represents two-dimensional turbulence. We also construct a model to interpret the

spectrum of this data which is almost independent of the wave number for a range of

frequencies.

1 Introduction

Two dimensional turbulence has been the subject of intense theoretical research [1, 2] and

simulation experiments [3]. The reason for this interest stems from the fundamental diﬀer-

ences between 3-d isotropic and 2-d turbulence. To begin with, vortex stretching is absent

in 2-d as a direct consequence of Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore in 3-d the energy

cascade is from the large eddies to small one but this process reverses itself in 2-d and leads

to the formation of large scale coherent eddies. Another diﬀerence between two and three

dimensional turbulence exists in the inertial range of the spectrum. Kraichnan showed [4]

that in 2-d in addition to Kolmogorov inertial range there is (due to ensotrophy conservation

in zero viscosity) another scaling law in the form

E(k) = cη2/3k−3

where η is ensotrophy dissipation rate.

While many simulations [5, 6] conﬁrm these theoretical predictions the actual observation

and detection of 2-d turbulence as a natural phenomena remains (as far as we know) an open

questions.

One of the objectives of this paper is to weigh in the pros and cons for 2-d turbulence

in the Antarctic data that was obtained by the British observation post as Haley Station in

Antarctica on June 22, 1987 (for further description of this data see [7, 8]). The importance of

these measurements stem from the fact that the ﬂow ﬁeld u = (u, v, w) and the temperatures

were measured simultaneously at three diﬀerent heights viz. 5m, 16m and 32m. These

simultaneous readings enable us to apply a test devised by E. Dewan [9] for the detection of

2-d turbulence. According to this test 2-d turbulence is characterized by small values for the

coherence [20] between the time series which represent the various meteorological variables

at diﬀerent heights.

From another point of view the Antarctic data represent a stably stratiﬁed medium.

(According to mission records the temperature gradient with height can reach up to 1K/m).

Under these circumstances Bolgiano [10, 11] and others [9] speculated about the existence of

“buoyancy range turbulence” (BRT) which should lead to a ﬂattening of the spectra in parts

of the inertial range. In this paper we shall estimate the power spectrum for the data using

3

the usual Fourier transform and by the method of maximum entropy (brieﬂy the reason

for this duplicatcy is due to the existence of “discontinuities” in the data). Both of these

estimates show a spectral range in which the spectrum is almost ﬂat and thus support the

theoretical arguments that were advanced for the existence of BRT.

The plan of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we describe the method used to ﬁlter

out the mean ﬂow and waves from the data and the tests that were applied to verify that

the residuals actually represent turbulence.

In section 3 we apply the coherence test for

2-d turbulence and discuss its consequences. In section 4 we present a model for the power

spectrum of the data and its implications. We end up in section 5 with some conclusions.

2 Data Detrending

The statistical approach to turbulence splits the ﬂow variables ˜u, ˜T (where ˜T is the temper-

˜u = u + u′ + u, ˜T = T + T ′ + t

where u, T represent the mean (large scale) ﬂow, u′, T ′ represent waves and u, t “turbulent

ature) into a sum

residuals” [12]

To eﬀect such a decomposition in our data we used the Karahunan-Loeve (K-L) decom-

position algorithm (or PCA) which was used by many researchers (for a review see [13]).

Here we shall give only a brief overview of this algorithm within our context.

Let be given a time series X (of length N) of some geophysical variable. We ﬁrst deter-

mine a time delay ∆ for which the points in the series are decorrelated. Using ∆ we create

n copies of the original series

X(k), X(d + ∆), . . . , X(k + (n − 1)∆).

(To create these one uses either periodicity or choose to consider shorter time-series). Then

one computes the auto-covariance matrix R = (Rij)

Rij =

X(k + i∆)X(k + j∆).

φi = (φi

i = 0, . . . , n − 1.

The original time series T can be reconstructed then as

(2.3)

The essence of the K-L decomposition is based on the recognition that if a large spectral

gap exists after the ﬁrst m1 eigenvalues of R then one can reconstruct the mean ﬂow (or

the large component ( of the data by using only the ﬁrst m1 eigenfunctions in (2.2). A

recent reﬁnement of this procedure due to Ghil et al [13] is that the data corresponding to

eigenvalues between m1 + 1 and up to the point m2 where they start to form a “continuum”

represent waves. The location of m2 can be ascertained further by applying the tests devised

by Axford [14] and Dewan [9] (see below).

Thus the original data can be decomposed into mean ﬂow, waves and residuals (i.e. data

corresponding to eigenvalues m2 + 1, . . . , n − 1 which we wish to interpret at least partly as

turbulent residuals).

For the data under consideration we carried out this decomposition using a delay ∆ of

1024 points (approximately 51 sec.) for all the geophysical variables. In table 1 we present

the values of m1, m2 that were used in this decomposition for the ﬂow variables at diﬀerent

heights. (In all cases n = 64).

The residuals of the time series which are reconstructed as

X r(j) =

ak(j)φk

Xk=m2+1

(2.4)

contain (obviously) the measurement errors in the data. However to ascertain that they

should be interpreted primarily as representing turbulence we utilize the tests devised by

Axford [14] and Dewan [9]. According to these tests turbulence data (at the same location)

is characterized by low coherence between u, v, w and a phase close to zero or π between w

and t. (A phase close to π/2 is characteristic of waves). Figs. 1,2,3 show samples of the

coherence between the residuals of u, v, w at diﬀerent heights. They demonstrate that for

most frequencies the coherence is less than 0.1. Fig. 4 gives a scatter plot of the phase

between w and t at height 5m. This ﬁgure is less deﬁnitive as there are still quite a few

points in the wave sector

. However out of the 200 points in this plot 125 are in

the “turbulence sector”.

These tests show that to a large extent the residuals that were obtained from the K-L

decomposition represent actual turbulence.

3 Tests for 2-d turbulence

In today literature [15] a spectral slope of −3 in part of the inertial range is considered to

be a strong indicator for 2-d turbulence. However as noted already by Lily [5] “geophysical

consideration” might modify this slope. Since the spectral plots for the ﬂow under consider-

ation (for sample see ﬁgs. 8,9,10) do not exhibit this dependency (except for w at 16m in the

low frequencies) we must resort to other tests to bolster the claim that the ﬂow described

by this data corresponds to 2-d turbulence.

To this end we utilize a test devised by Dewan [9]. According to this test inviscid two

dimensional turbulence is characterized by the fact that the temporal statistical coherency

[20] between the time series representing the ﬂow variables at diﬀerent altitudes is zero. With

viscosity taken into account some vertical separation of the order of (10m for air) is needed

for the coherency to become small. (Strong coherency with values close to one indicates a

strong linear relationship between the two time series [20]).

Some typical plots for the coherency in the data is presented in ﬁgs. (5,6,7). In these

plots the coherency for w between the diﬀerent heights is plotted for diﬀerent wave numbers.

We observe that for most sampled frequencies the coherency is well below 0.1 and according

to Dewan [9] “these values constitute evidence for 2-d turbulence and against other types of

ﬂuctuations”.

4 The spectrum

Two dimensional ﬂow of incompressible and inviscid ﬂuid conserve both the energy E and

the enstrophy Ω. Fir viscous ﬂuid these quantities decay according to

−ǫ =

= −2νΩ, −ǫω =

= −ν | ∇ω |2

(4.1)

∂E
∂t

∂Ω
∂t

The energy spectrum is determined therefore by both parameters ǫ, ǫω which leads to the

deﬁnition of a length scale

From dimensional considerations one concludes then that [16] the energy spectrum in the

inertial range must have the form

where f is a function of the dimensionless variable kLω. If at one end of the inertial range only
ǫ is essential (and the eﬀect of ǫω is negligible) then f ∼= constant and the energy spectrum
obey Kolmogorov 5/3 power law. If on the other end of this range ǫ is not essential then f

must have the form

and consequently

(where C is a constant).

For stratiﬁed medium Obukov [17] introduced the temperature inhomogeneity dissipation

where ET is the temperature spectra and χ is the heat conductivity of the medium. He

further postulated that the turbulent component of T is dependent on this parameter.

For the (stratiﬁed) Antarctic medium we would like to enlarge the domain of this pos-

tulate to include the velocity components of the ﬂow. This enables us to introduce the

buoyancy (length) scale [16, 18]

where (αg) is the buoyancy parameter. The existence of this second length scale for stratiﬁed

two dimensional ﬂow lead us to replace (4.3) by

LB = (αg)−3/2ǫ5/4ǫ

−3/4
T

E(k) = f (kLω, kLB)ǫ2/3k−5/3

However since stratiﬁcation and enstrophy conservation are independent of each other we

infer that f must have the form

It follows then that the spectral dependence on k is given by

diﬀerent spectral dependencies on k.

Thus if

E(k) ∼ k−q

We conclude therefore that various combinations of r, s are possible and this will lead to

From the spectral plots for the data under consideration we see that (approximately)

turbulence” as predicted by Bolgiano [10, 11].

It is interesting to note in this context that Kriachnen [19] already observed that the

“energy spectrum of the ﬂow depends on the details of the nonlinear interaction embodied

in the equations that govern the ﬂow and can not be deduced solely from the symmetries,

invariances and dimensionality of the equations”.

Finally we would like to observe that the data under consideration contains some dis-

continuities. These can change completely the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum. To

demonstrate this assume that the data is described by

D(x) = CH(x − x0) + g(x)

(4.11)

where g(x) is a smooth function whose Fourier transform (FT) decays exponentially and

H(x) is the Heaviside function

Diﬀerentiating (4.11) we have

and the FT of (4.12) is

H(x) = 


1 x ≥ 0

0 x < 0.



D′(x) = Cδ(x − x0) + g′(x)

˜D′(k) = C + ˜g′(k)

(4.12)

(4.13)

The FT of D is obtained then by dividing (4.13) by k which shows clearly that the asymptotic
behavior of ˜D(k) is proportional to k−1.

We conclude then that a proper ﬁlter for the removal of these discontinuities from the

data is needed in order to obtain the true spectrum of the turbulent residuals. Such a ﬁltering

algorithm is given by the K − L decomposition which was described in Sec. 2.

5 Conclusion

Using the coherency test advanced by Dewan we are able to characterize the ﬂow under

consideration as one that has the characteristics of 2-d turbulence. One stumbling block for

9

this interpretation is the absence of −3 slope in part of the inertial range. To explain this we

introduced a model that takes into account the stratiﬁcation of this ﬂow. This model shows

that when buoyancy eﬀects are taken into account diﬀerent slopes of E(k) are possible. Thus

we believe that we introduced evidence for the interpretation of this spectra as one belonging

to BTR.

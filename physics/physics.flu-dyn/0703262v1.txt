A mechanism for oscillatory instability in

viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow

(Received 2 February 2008)

Interior stagnation point ﬂows of viscoelastic liquids arise in a wide variety of appli-

cations including extensional viscometry, polymer processing and microﬂuidics. Experi-

mentally, these ﬂows have long been known to exhibit instabilities, but the mechanisms

underlying them have not previously been elucidated. We computationally demonstrate

the existence of a supercritical oscillatory instability of low-Reynolds number viscoelastic

ﬂow in a two-dimensional cross-slot geometry. The ﬂuctuations are closely associated with

the “birefringent strand” of highly stretched polymer chains associated with the outﬂow

from the stagnation point at high Weissenberg number. Additionally, we describe the

mechanism of instability, which arises from the coupling of ﬂow with extensional stresses

and their steep gradients in the stagnation point region.

1. Introduction

While Newtonian ﬂows become unstable only at high Reynolds number Re, when the

inertial terms in momentum balance dominate, ﬂows of viscoelastic ﬂuids such as polymer

solutions and melts are known to have interesting instabilities and nonlinear dynamical

behaviors even at extremely low Re. These “purely elastic” instabilities arise in rheometry

of complex ﬂuids as well as in many applications (Larson 1992; Shaqfeh 1996). Recent

studies of viscoelastic ﬂows in microﬂuidic devices broaden the scope of these nonlin-

ear dynamical problems of viscoelastic ﬂows (Squires & Quake 2005). The small length

scales in microﬂuidic devices enable large shear rates, and thus high Wi (Weissenberg

number, Wi ≡ λ ˙γ, where λ is a characteristic time scale of the ﬂuid and ˙γ is a charac-

teristic shear rate of the ﬂow), at very low Re. Instabilities are not always undesirable,

especially when the accompanying ﬂow modiﬁcation is controllable and can thus be uti-

lized in the design and operation of microﬂuidic devices. Speciﬁcally, instabilities have

been found and ﬂow-controlling logic elements have been designed in a series of microﬂu-

idic geometries, e.g. ﬂow rectiﬁer with anisotropic resistance (Groisman & Quake 2004),

ﬂip-ﬂop memory (Groisman et al. 2003) and nonlinear ﬂow resistance (Groisman et al.

2003). Another prospective application of these instabilities is to enhancement of mixing

at lab-on-a-chip length scales (Groisman & Steinberg 2001), where turbulent mixing is

absent due to small length scales and an alternative is needed.

The best understood of these instabilities are those that occur in viscometric ﬂows with

curved streamlines: e.g. ﬂows in Taylor-Couette (Muller et al. 1989), Taylor-Dean (Joo & Shaqfeh

1994), cone-and-plate (Magda & Larson 1988) and parallel-plates (Groisman & Steinberg

2000; Magda & Larson 1988) ﬂow geometries. In these geometries, the primary source of

instability is the coupling of normal stresses with streamline curvature (i.e. the presence of

“hoop stresses”), leading to radial compressive forces that can drive instabilities (Shaqfeh

1996; Muller et al. 1989; Joo & Shaqfeh 1994; Magda & Larson 1988; Larson et al. 1990;

Pakdel & McKinley 1996; Graham 1998). Similar mechanisms drive instabilities in vis-

coelastic free surface ﬂows (Spiegelberg & McKinley 1996; Graham 2003).

Attention in this paper focuses on a diﬀerent class of ﬂows, whose instabilities are not

well-understood – stagnation point ﬂows, like those generated with opposed-jet (Chow et al.

Viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow instability

1988; M¨uller et al. 1988), cross-slot (Arratia et al. 2006), two-roll mill (Ng & Leal 1993)

and four-roll mill (Ng & Leal 1993; Broadbent et al. 1978) devices. Figure 1 shows a

schematic of a cross-slot geometry. A characteristic phenomenon in these stagnation

point ﬂows is the formation of a narrow region of ﬂuid with high polymer stress ex-

tending downstream from the stagnation point. This region can be observed in optical

experiments as a bright birefringent “strand” with the rest of ﬂuid dark (Harlen et al.

1990). Keller and coworkers (Chow et al. 1988; M¨uller et al. 1988) reported instabilities

in stagnation point ﬂows of semi-dilute polymer solutions generated by an axisymmetric

opposed-jet device. Speciﬁcally, for a ﬁxed polymer species and concentration, upon a

critical extension rate (or critical Wi) polymer chains become stretched by ﬂow near the

stagnation point and a sharp uniform birefringent stand forms. The width of this birefrin-

gent strand increases with increasing Wi until a stability limit is reached, beyond which

the birefringent strand becomes destabilized and changes in its morphology are observed.

At higher Wi, the ﬂow pattern and birefringent strand become time-dependent. Recent

tracer and particle-tracking experiments of stagnation point ﬂow in a micro-fabricated

cross-slot geometry by Arratia et al. (Arratia et al. 2006) show instabilities of dilute

polymer solution at low Re (< 10−2). In their experiments ﬂuid from one of the two

incoming channels is dyed and a sharp and ﬂat interface between dyed and undyed ﬂuids

is observed at low Wi. Upon an onset value of Wi, this ﬂow pattern loses its stability:

spatial symmetry is broken but the ﬂow remains steady. The interface becomes distorted

in such a way that more than half of the dyed ﬂuid goes to one of the outgoing channels

while more undyed ﬂuid travels through the other. At even higher Wi the ﬂow becomes

time-dependent and the direction of asymmetry ﬂips between two outgoing channels with

4

time. Particle-tracking images in the time-dependent ﬂow pattern indicate the existence

of vortical structures around stagnation point.

Another class of stagnation point ﬂows is associated with liquid-solid or liquid-gas

interfaces, such as ﬂows passing submerged solid obstacles, around moving bubbles or

toward a free surface. For example, McKinley et al. (McKinley et al. 1993) reported a

three-dimensional steady cellular disturbances in the wake of a cylinder submerged in

a viscoelastic ﬂuid. Around a falling sphere in viscoelastic ﬂuids, fore-and-aft symmetry

of velocity ﬁeld is broken and the velocity perturbation in the wake can be away from

the sphere, toward the sphere or a combination of the two depending on the polymer

solution (Hassager 1979; Bisgaard & Hassager 1982; Bisgaard 1983).

Remmelgas et al. (Remmelgas et al. 1999) computationally studied the stagnation

point ﬂow in a cross-slot geometry with two diﬀerent FENE (ﬁnite extensible nonlinear

elastic) dumbbell models. Using the two models, they studied the eﬀects of conﬁguration-

dependent friction coeﬃcient on polymer relaxation and the shape of the birefringent

strand. Their simulation approach was restricted to relatively low Wi (∼ O(1)) with

symmetry imposed on centerlines of all channels. Harlen (Harlen 2002) conducted sim-

ulations of a sedimenting sphere in a viscoelastic ﬂuid to explore the wake behaviors.

He explains the experimental observations of both negative (velocity perturbation away

from the sphere) and extended (velocity perturbation toward the sphere) wakes in terms

of combined eﬀects of the stretched polymer in the birefringent strand following the

stagnation point behind the sphere and the recoil outside of the strand. Neither of these

analyses directly addressed instabilities of these ﬂows.

Various approximate approaches have been taken in the past to obtain an understand-

ing of these instabilities observed in experiments. Harris and Rallison (Harris & Rallison

1993, 1994) investigated the instabilities of the birefringent strand behind a free isolated

stagnating point through a simpliﬁed approach, in which polymer molecules are modeled

Viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow instability

as linear-locked dumbbells, which are fully stretched within a thin strand lying along the

centerline. Polymer molecules contribute a normal stress proportional to the extension

rate only when they are fully stretched (i.e. in the strand), otherwise the ﬂow is treated

as Newtonian. The lubrication approximation is applied for the Newtonian region and

the eﬀects of birefringent strand are coupled into the problem through point forces along

the strand. Two instabilities are reported. At low Wi (≈ 1.2−1.7), a varicose disturbance

is linearly unstable, in which the width of birefringent strand oscillates without breaking

the symmetry of the ﬂow pattern. At higher Wi another instability is observed in which

symmetry with respect to the extension axis breaks and the birefringent strand becomes

sinuous in shape and oscillatory with time, with zero displacement at the stagnation point

and increasing magnitude of displacement downstream from it. Symmetry with respect

to the inﬂow axis is always imposed. The mechanism of these instabilities is explained:

perturbations in the shape or position of the birefringent strand aﬀect the stretching of

incoming polymer molecules such that they enhance the perturbation after they become

fully stretched and merge into the strand. This mechanism is close to the one we are

about to present later in this paper with regard to the importance of ﬂow kinematics

and the extensional stress. However, in their linear stability analysis the spatial depen-

dence of the birefringent strand in the outﬂow direction is neglected, which is important

according to our simulations. ¨Oztekin et al. ( ¨Oztekin et al. 1997) studied steady state

similarity solution for planar stagnation point ﬂow at a solid wall predicting that this

ﬂow is linearly unstable to local three-dimensional disturbances. Their results indicate

that traveling wave disturbances that have periodic structure in the neutral direction

could lead to instabilities of steady state solutions above certain critical Wi.

In this paper, we present numerical simulation results of viscoelastic stagnation point

6

ﬂow in a two-dimensional cross-slot geometry. With increasing Wi, we observe the forma-

tion and elongation of the birefringent strand across the stagnation point. At high Wi, we

ﬁnd the occurrence of an oscillatory instability. These results resemble the experimental

observations of oscillatory birefringent width by M¨uller et al. (M¨uller et al. 1988) and

the varicose instability predicted by Harris et al. (Harris & Rallison 1994). By analyzing

the perturbations in both velocity and stress ﬁelds, a novel instability mechanism based

on normal stress eﬀects and ﬂow kinematics is identiﬁed.

2. Formulation and Methods

We consider a fourfold symmetric planar cross-slot geometry, as shown in Figure 1.

Flow enters from top and bottom and leaves from left and right. For laminar Newtonian

ﬂow, two incoming streams meet at the intersection of the cross and each of them splits

evenly and goes into both outgoing channels, generating a stagnation point at the origin

near which an extensional ﬂow exists. We use round corners at the intersections of channel

walls in order to avoid enormous stress gradients at the corners, which cause numerical

diﬃculties.

Parameters in Equations (2.1) and (2.2) are deﬁned as: Re ≡ ρU l/ (ηs + ηp), Wi ≡ 2λU/l

and β ≡ ηs/ (ηs + ηp), where ρ is the ﬂuid density and for dilute polymer solution we

assume it to be the same as the solvent density; ηs is the solvent viscosity and ηp is

the polymer contribution to the shear viscosity at zero shear rate and U and l are

characteristic velocity and length scales of the ﬂow. Here l is chosen to be the half

channel width and the deﬁnition of U is based on the pressure drop applied between the

entrances and exits of the channel. Speciﬁcally, U is deﬁned to be the centerline velocity

of a Newtonian plane Poiseuille ﬂow under the same pressure drop in a straight channel

with length 20l, which is comparable to the lengths of streamlines in the present geometry.

According to this deﬁnition, the nondimensional pressure drop in our simulation is ﬁxed

at 40 and the centerline Newtonian velocity in cross-slot geometry is typically slightly

lower than 1 since the extensional ﬂow near the stagnation point has a higher resistance

than that in a straight channel. The polymer contribution to the stress tensor is denoted

τ p and is calculated with the FENE-P constitutive equations (Bird et al. 1987):

connected by a ﬁnitely-extensible-nonlinear-elastic spring). Here α ≡ hQQi is the con-

formation tensor of the dumbbells where Q is the end-to-end vector of the dumbbells and

h·i represents an ensemble average. The parameter b determines the maximum extension

of dumbbells, i.e. the upper limit of tr(α).

At the entrances and exits of the ﬂow geometry, normal ﬂow boundary conditions are

applied, i.e. t · u = 0 where t is the unit vector tangential to the boundary. Pressure is

set to be 40 at entrances and 0 at exits. No-slip boundary conditions are applied at all

other boundaries. Boundary conditions for stress are only needed at the entrances, where

the proﬁle of α is set to be the same as that for a fully developed pressure-driven ﬂow

in a straight channel with the same Wi. Other ﬁxed parameters in our simulations are:

Re = 0.1, β = 0.95 and b = 1000, which means we focus on dilute solutions of long-chain

polymers at low Reynolds number.

The discrete elastic stress splitting (DEVSS) formulation (Baaijens et al. 1997; Baaijens

1998) is applied in our simulation: i.e. a new variable Λ is introduced as the rate of strain

and a new equation is added into the equation system:

Λ = ∇u + ∇uT .

(2.5)

A numerical stabilization term γ∇ ·

is added to the right-hand-side

∇u + ∇uT − Λ
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

of the momentum balance (Equation (2.1)) and it is worthwhile to point out that this

term is only nontrivial in the discretized formulation and does not change the physical

problem. In this term, γ is an adjustable parameter and γ = 1.0 is used in our sim-

ulations. The velocity ﬁeld u is interpolated with quadratic elements while pressure p,

polymer conformation tensor α and rate of strain Λ are interpolated with linear ele-

ments. Consistent with Baaijens’s conclusion (Baaijens 1998), DEVSS greatly increases

the upper limit of Wi achievable in our simulations. Quadrilateral elements are used for

all variables. Our experience shows that quadrilateral elements have great advantages

Viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow instability

over triangular ones, yielding much better spatial smoothness in the stress ﬁeld at com-

parable degrees of freedom to be solved. Another merit of quadrilateral elements is the

capability of manual control over mesh grids. This is extremely important when certain

restrictions, such as symmetry, are required. In our simulation, ﬁner meshes are used

within and around the intersection region of the geometry and the mesh is required to

be symmetric with respect to both axes. Within a horizontal band (−0.2 < y < 0.2)

across the stagnation point, very ﬁne meshes are generated to capture the sharp stress

gradient along the birefringent strand. The streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin method

(SUPG) (Brooks & Hughes 1982) is applied in Equation (2.3) by replacing the usual

Galerkin weighting function w with w + δhu · ∇w/kuk, where h is the geometric average

of the local mesh length scales and δ is an adjustable parameter, set to δ = 0.3 in our

simulations. This formulation is implemented using the commercially available COMSOL

Multiphysics software.

3. Results and Discussions

3.1. Steady States

Steady state solutions are found for all Wi investigated (0.2 < Wi < 100) in our study.

For Wi 6 60 steady states are found by time integration and for those with larger Wi

Newton iteration (parameter continuation) is used because of possible loss of stability,

as we describe below. At low Wi the velocity ﬁeld is virtually unaﬀected by the polymer

molecules. Velocity contours at Wi = 0.2 are plotted in Figure 2(a); for clarity only part

of the channel is shown. A stagnation point is found at the center of the domain ((0, 0)) In

both incoming and outgoing channels, the ﬂow is almost the same as pressure driven ﬂow

in a straight channel. No distinct diﬀerence can be observed for the incoming and outgoing

10

directions in velocity ﬁeld. Figure 2(b) shows contours of extension rate at Wi = 0.2,

in which a region dominated by extensional ﬂow is found near stagnation point. High

extension rate is also found near the corners due to the no-slip walls. The magnitude of

polymer stretching can be measured by the trace of its conformation tensor tr(α), and is

plotted in Figure 2(c). At low Wi, the extent to which polymers are deformed is barely

noticeable, but it can be clearly seen that polymers are primarily stretched in either the

extensional ﬂow near the stagnation point and corners or the shear ﬂows near the walls.

At high Wi (Wi = 50, Figure 3), the situation is very diﬀerent. Polymers are strongly

stretched by the extensional ﬂow near the stagnation point and this stretching eﬀect by

extensional ﬂow overwhelms that of the shear ﬂow. A distinct band of highly stretched

polymers (the birefringent strand) forms (Figure 3(c)). Since the polymer relaxation time

in this case is larger than the ﬂow convection time from stagnation point to the exits, this

birefringent strand extends the whole length of the simulation domain. The resulting high

polymer stress signiﬁcantly aﬀects the velocity ﬁeld (Figure 3(a)). Regions with reduced

velocity extend much farther away in the downstream directions of the stagnation point

than in the low Wi case, especially along the x-axis, where high polymer stress dominates.

Correspondingly, a reduction in the extension rate near the stagnation point is observed,

most noticeably along the birefringent strand (Figure 3(b)).

Figures 4 and 5 show proﬁles at various values of Wi of tr(α) along the outﬂow (x-axis)

and inﬂow (y-axis) directions of this stagnation point (note the diﬀerence in scales in the

two plots). For increasing Wi the length of the region with highly stretched polymer keeps

increasing due to the increased relative relaxation time (Figure 4). In high Wi cases (Wi =

30 and Wi = 100), polymers are not fully relaxed even when they reach the exit of the

simulation domain. The cross-sectional view of tr(α) proﬁle along the y-axis (Figure 5)

shows interesting non-monotonic behaviors. Although the height of the proﬁle (tr(α)max)

Wi > 30 are not shown since they exceed the length of the simulation domain). A clear

non-monotonic trend is observed in the plot of birefringence width, where W increases

sharply at relatively low Wi and peaks around Wi = 40. After that W decreases mildly

but consistently with further higher Wi. This non-monotonic trend is consistent with

experimental observations of birefringence in opposed-jet devices (M¨uller et al. 1988).

Similarly, a non-monotonicity is also found in the change of velocity ﬁeld with Wi.

Shown in Figure 7 is the value of extension rate, averaged within a box around the

stagnation point (−0.1 < x < 0.1, −0.1 < y < 0.1), as a function of Wi. As Wi increases,

the extension rate decreases at low Wi but increases at high Wi, with a minimum found

around Wi = 40. Besides, most of experimental results are presented in terms of Deborah

number (De), deﬁned as the product of the polymer relaxation time and an estimate of the

extension rate near the stagnation point. Noticing that the average (nondimensionlized)

De = 0.3Wi can be adopted for comparison of our results with experimental ones.

Some understanding of this non-monotonicity can be gained by looking at Figure 4.

Wi

Here it can be seen that for Wi . 30, the birefringent strand is not yet “fully developed”

in the sense that the polymer stretching is not yet saturating near full extension. Thus

the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld in this regime of Wi reﬂects the signiﬁcant changes

that occur in the stress ﬁeld in this regime. At higher Wi, however, the polymer stress

ﬁeld in the strand is saturating, and thus not changing signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, at

these high Weissenberg numbers, the relaxation of stress downstream of the stagnation

point diminishes, decreasing the gradient ∂τ xx/∂x and thus decreasing the eﬀect of

viscoelasticity on the ﬂow near the stagnation point.

3.2. Periodic Orbits

We turn now to the stability of the steady states that have just been described. Rather

than attempting to compute the eigenspectra of the linearization of the problem, an

exceedingly demanding task, we examine stability by direct time integration of perturbed

steady states. The perturbations take the form of slightly asymmetric pressure proﬁles at

for one time unit, then released. As an example, Figure 8 shows a two dimensional

projection of the trajectory of the system evolution over time at Wi = 66. Here the

velocity magnitude at a point near the stagnation point ((0.5, 0)) is plotted against the

birefringent strand width W measured on the inﬂow axis. The system starts at the steady

state with W = 0.1593 and kuk(0.5,0) = 0.2687 and spirals outward with time after the

perturbation. Eventually the trajectory merges into a cycle (the outer dark cycle in

the Figure 8). This clearly identiﬁes the existence of a stable periodic orbit. Note the

anticorrelation between kuk and W , i.e. when the ﬂow speeds up near the stagnation

point, the strand thins and vice versa.

state values , normalized by the corresponding steady state values Ws.s., as a function of

Wi for all the cases where we found periodic orbits. Time integrations for Wi > 74 did

not converge due to the enormous stress gradient around the corners of the no-slip walls

from our simulations are ﬁtted with a function of the form a(Wi − b)c, with c ﬁxed

at 1/2. Very good agreement is found for our simulation data with the 1/2 power law,

characteristic of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation (Guckenheimer & Holmes 1983). The

critical Weissenberg number Wicritical is identiﬁed to be 64.99 by this ﬁtting. Also shown

in Figure 9 are periods of oscillations, where a slight decrease with increasing Wi is

found. This is interesting since it indicates that some time scale other than the polymer

relaxation time sets the period of oscillations.

Time-dependent ﬂuctuations of birefringence width are also reported in the experi-

ments done by M¨uller et al. (M¨uller et al. 1988) in opposed-jet devices. In their optical

experiments with semi-dilute aPS solutions, the width of the birefringent strand oscil-

lates rapidly between two values in a certain range of extension rate. The critical value of

extension rate for the instability in their study is close to the one where the birefringent

18

strand width W is highest, while in our simulations Wicritical (= 65) is somewhat larger

than the one (Wi ≈ 40) that gives the largest W .

3.3. Instability Mechanism

We turn now to the spatiotemporal structure of the instability and its underlying physical

mechanism. We will denote the deviations in velocity, pressure and stress with primes,

while steady state values will be denoted with a superscript “s”:

u = us + u′

,

p = ps + p

α = αs + α′

Figures 10, 11 and 12 illustrate u′

x, u′

y and α′

xx, respectively, at intervals of 1/8 period,

corresponding to the periodic orbit at a Weissenberg number close to the bifurcation

point (Wi = 66). Time starts from an arbitrarily chosen snapshot on the periodic orbit

and only a quarter of the region near the stagnation point is shown, behavior in the rest

of the domain can be inferred from the reﬂection symmetry across the axes.

At the beginning of the cycle (Figure 10(a)), u′

x is positive in the region very close

to the stagnation point while it is negative in most of the downstream region. As time

goes on, this positive deviation near the stagnation point grows into a “jet”, a region of

liquid moving downstream away from the stagnation point faster than the steady state

velocity, as shown in Figures 10(b), 10(c) and 10(d). Correspondingly, by continuity, the

inﬂow toward the stagnation point is also faster as shown in Figures 11(a)–11(d). Note

that very near the stagnation point deviations from steady state remain small. At the

beginning of the second half of the cycle (Figure 10(e)), the jet extends further down-

stream and grows to the full width of the channel. Meanwhile, in the region closer to the

stagnation point, velocity deviations drop (Figures 10(e), 11(e)) and start to change signs

Viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow instability

(Figures 10(f), 11(f)). Consequently, the growth of the jet is interrupted and a “wake”,

a region of ﬂuid moving slower than the steady state velocity, emerges downstream (Fig-

ures 10(f)– 10(h) and 11(f)– 11(h)). Similarly, as the wake grow larger, velocity deviations

near the stagnation point change signs and a new cycle starts (Figures 10(a) and 11(a)).

The velocity deviations are closely related with those of the stress ﬁeld (Figure 12).

Generally speaking, “jets” are accompanied by negative α′

xx and thus thinning of the

birefringent strand and “wakes” are associated with the birefringent thickening. The

largest deviations are found at the edges of the birefringent strand where ∂αs

xx/∂y is

largest. Note that deviations in the stress ﬁeld are always small along the centerline of

the birefringent strand because there polymer molecules are almost fully stretched and

the huge spring force is suﬃcient to resist any perturbations.

One may notice the small spatial oscillations in the stress ﬁeld deviations, characterized

by alternating high and low stress stripes, along the outﬂow direction. These oscillations,

apparently unphysical and centered around zero, also exist along the birefringence strand

in steady state solutions, though they are not easy to see from the contour in Figure 3(c)

as they are overwhelmed by high tr(α) in the birefringent strand. Unfortunately, as

proven by Renardy (Renardy 2006), spatial non-smoothness is inevitable in numerical

simulations of viscoelastic extensional ﬂow upon certain Wi due to the singularities in

stress gradients. These singularities could not be fully resolved by any ﬁnite mesh size

and this problem would always show up in numerical solutions of high Wi viscoelastic

stagnation point ﬂows. However, we do not expect these oscillations to qualitatively

aﬀect our observations for a couple of reasons. First, non-smoothness has been observed

in our simulation at Wi values much lower than the critical Wi of this instability. Second,

observable non-smoothness is always found some distance away from the stagnation point

20

in the downstream direction while the instability is dominated by the physics in the close

vicinity of the stagnation point and since FENE-P is a convective equation we do not

expect anything occurring downstream to aﬀect upstream dynamics. Last, and most

importantly, simulations with diﬀerent meshes display diﬀerent mesh size dependent

stripes, while the nature of the instability remains virtually unchanged.

Insight into the mechanism of this instability can be gained by examining the linearized

In the following analysis, terms on the right-hand-side (RHS) of Equation 3.4 are named

“RHS∗”, where “∗” is determined by the order of appearance on the RHS. Terms and

their physical meanings are summarized in Table 1. To understand the mechanism of the

instability, magnitudes of these terms at the point (0, −0.05) are plotted as a function of

time during roughly a period in the bottom view of Figure 13. Terms RHS3, RHS5, RHS8

and RHS10 are zero by symmetry and not plotted. This position is right at the edge of

the birefringent strand and as shown in Figure 12, it is also where signiﬁcant deviations

in the stress ﬁeld are observed. Time-dependent oscillations at other places, including oﬀ

the symmetry axis x = 0, have also been checked and nothing that could qualitatively

aﬀect our analysis was seen. Correspondingly, deviations in polymer conformation, inﬂow

velocity and extension rate, normalized by steady state values, are plotted in the top view

of Figure 13.

Finally, notice that among the three destabilizing terms, RHS6 is the one that leads the

phase and thus guides the instability.

Based on these observations from Figure 13, a mechanism for the instability can be

proposed, which is illustrated schematically in Figure 14. At the beginning of the cycle

(t = 0), u′

y is slightly above zero, indicating that the inﬂow speed is faster than that

in the steady state. As a consequence, RHS6 becomes negative ﬁrst, followed by RHS4

and RHS9. In particular, a faster incoming convective ﬂow brings unstretched polymer

molecules toward the stagnation point (corresponding to RHS6), as depicted in Fig-

ure 14(a). These polymer chains have less time to get stretched and when they reach the

edges of the birefringent strand (e.g. dumbbell B), they are less stretched compared with

the steady state. As a result, ﬂuid around dumbbell B has lower stress than at the steady

state, corresponding to a thinning of the birefringent strand. Meanwhile, since dumbbell

B contains smaller spring forces than its downstream neighbors A and A’, the net forces

(shaded arrows) exerted by polymer on the ﬂuid point outward, generating jets down-

stream from the stagnation point. (In other words, when the stress at the center is lower,

the net stress divergence points outward, which increases momentum in the downstream

directions.) By continuity, more ﬂuid has to be drawn toward the stagnation point and

the initial deviation in u′

y is then enhanced. However, as the ﬂow speeds up in the vicinity

of the stagnation point, the extension rate also starts to increase. This eﬀect (correspond-

ing to RHS7) tends to stretch polymer molecules more and stabilize the deviations, as

shown in Figure 13. Eventually this eﬀect will be able to overcome that of RHS6 as well

as RHS4 and RHS9 and the stress near the stagnation point starts increase after it passes

the minimum at around t = 3.5, which causes a re-thickening of the birefringent strand

as illustrated in Figure 14(b). By a similar argument as that above, dumbbell C has

higher spring forces than B and B’, the dumbbells which were passing near the center

when stress was at minimum, and the net polymer forces point inward, which starts to

suppress the jets. Inﬂow velocity decreases as the birefringent strand thickens and this

gives incoming polymer molecules more time to be stretched and further thickens the

birefringent strand. Eventually αxx will come back to the steady state value at around

t = 7.2, however, since all the deviations are not synchronized, a negative deviation is

found in uy and an identical analysis with opposite signs can be made for the second half

of the cycle.

Within this mechanism, a sharp edge of the birefringent strand, i.e. large magnitude

of ∂αxx/∂y (∼ O(104) in our simulations), is required so that a small u′

y can give a

Viscoelastic cross-slot ﬂow instability

27

suﬃciently large RHS6 to drive the instability. This is made possible by the kinemat-

ics of the ﬂow near the stagnation point, where the incoming polymer molecules are

strongly stretched within a short distance. Another similar eﬀect is that stress deriva-

tives are stretched in the outgoing direction and thus greatly weakened as ﬂuid moves

downstream; therefore the instability is dominated by physics in the vicinity of the stag-

nation point. In the earlier mechanism for the so-called “varicose instability”, given by

Harris and Rallison (Harris & Rallison 1994), the importance of extensional stress and

ﬂow kinematics, especially the role of convection of incoming molecules, was also recog-

nized. However, the picture described in their work is not the same as ours due to the

simpliﬁcations in their model. Their linear stability analysis ignores the x-dependence

of the birefringent width while in our simulations, x-dependence of the stress ﬁeld is

closely related to the changes in velocity ﬁeld. Besides, their analysis does not identify a

restoring force for the deviations and the oscillatory behavior could not be explained.

4. Conclusions

Using a DEVSS/SUPG formulation of the ﬁnite element method, we are able to simu-

late viscoelastic stagnation point ﬂow and obtain steady state and time-dependent solu-

tions at high Wi. For Wi ≫ 1, a clear birefringent strand is observed. The width of this

birefringent strand increases with increasing Wi until Wi ≈ 40 after which it declines

gradually. This also results in a non-monotonic trend in the modiﬁcation of the velocity

ﬁeld.

At around Wi = 65 the steady state solution loses stability and a periodic orbit be-

comes the attractor in phase space. Flow motion of the periodic orbit is characterized by

time-dependent ﬂuctuations, speciﬁcally, alternating positive (jet) and negative (wake)

28

deviations from the steady state velocity in the regions downstream of the stagnation

point. A mechanism is proposed which, taking account of the interaction between ve-

locity and stress ﬁelds, is able to explain the whole process of the oscillatory instability.

Extensional stresses and their gradients as well as the ﬂow kinetics near the stagnation

points is identiﬁed as important factors in the mechanism. This mechanism is diﬀerent

from that of the “hoop stress” instabilities, which occur in viscometric ﬂows with curved

streamlines, and we expect that this mechanism could be extended and explain various

instabilities occurring in viscoelastic ﬂows with stagnation points.

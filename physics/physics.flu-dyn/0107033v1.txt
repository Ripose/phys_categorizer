Abstract

The Navier-Stokes-Fourier model for a 3D thermoconducting viscous ﬂuid,

where the evolution equation for the temperature T contains a term propor-

tional to the rate of energy dissipation, is investigated analitically at the light

of the rotational invariance property. Two cases are considered: the Cou-

ette ﬂow and a ﬂow with a radial velocity between two rotating impermeable

and porous coaxial cylinders, respectively. In both cases, we show the exis-

tence of a maximum value of T , Tmax, when the diﬀerence of temperature

T1 on the surfaces of the cylinders is assigned. The role of Tmax is

∆T = T2 −
discussed in the context of diﬀerent physical situations.

In Ref. [1], a thermoconducting incompressible viscous ﬂuid system, named Navier-

Stokes-Fourier (NSF) model, is presented. In 3D, this model is governed by the equations

where u is the velocity ﬁeld, T = T (x, y, z, t) is a passive scalar identiﬁed by the ﬂuid tem-

the thermal diﬀusivity, and ∂i ≡

∂/∂xi (x1 ≡

x, x2 ≡

y, x3 ≡

z).

The r.h.s. in (3) is related to the rate of energy dissipation ε = 2νS2, where S2 = SijSij

and Sij = (1/2)(∂iuj + ∂jui) are the strain matrix elements. Among the many questions

arising in the study of the model (1)-(3), such as for instance the investigation of statistical

solutions and the onset of turbulence [3], the presence of a dissipation term in the equation for

the temperature deserves a special attention. At the best of our knowledge, in three spatial

dimensions Eqs. (1)-(3) have never been studied by exploiting an analytic procedure. In

this Letter we discuss some new thermal eﬀects described by exact solutions of the vortex

type of the NSF model. In particular, we have analyzed a steady Taylor-Couette ﬂow for

an incompressible ﬂuid entrapped between two rotating coaxial impermeable cylinders, and

a ﬂow with an additional radial component of the velocity, when the walls of the cylinders

are porous (for technical details on the experimental devices, see [4,5]). As is well-known,

the hydrodynamic problems connected with the system of two coaxial rotating cylinders has

been intensively studied from an experimental and theoretical point of view since the work of

Couette (1890) [6]. The main motivation was the discovery by Taylor of unstable ﬂow regimes

consisting in toroidal vortices (1923), which appear for high values of the Taylor number [7].

This number can be deﬁned in several forms. Following [5] we will use T a = r1Ω1d/ν, where

r1 is the radius of the inner cylinder, d the width of the gap between the two cylinders, Ω1

the rotational velocity of the inner cylinder.

In our context, we will consider low Taylor

numbers (T a

100

200), in order to preserve the geometrical symmetries of the model.

∼

÷

In the two cases of impermeable and porous cylinders, we show the existence of a value

Tmax for the temperature ﬁeld associated with the ﬂuid, when the diﬀerence of temperature

T1 on the surfaces of the cylinders is assigned for asymptotic values of time. This

∆T = T2 −
maximum appears as a consequence of a mechanism of energy dissipation in heat, due to

viscous eﬀects, and depends on the width of the gap between the cylinders, on their relative

angular velocity, and on the ﬁxed value of ∆T . Remarkably, we found that the position of

Tmax as a function of the radial coordinate r can vary continuously in the gap r1 ≤

r

≤

r2

2

between the two cylinders by varying the parameter ∆T .

In the NSF model, ρ is taken to be constant. Although this assumption could appear

as a too severe restriction on the possible modelling of realistic situations, nevertheless the

NSF model deserves to be analyzed as a guide-framework for the investigation of less ideal

systems, such as the Rayleigh and the Lorentz models, which describe incompressible ﬂuid

motions where thermal phenomena are more signiﬁcant [1].

We found that the NSF model allows Lie-point symmetries generated by inﬁnitesimal

operators giving ﬁnite group transformations and exact solutions via the corresponding re-

duced equations. (The technical machinery yielding these reductions is outlined in [8,9]).

Many of these symmetries have a nice geometric interpretation: they express the invariance

of the NSF system under rotations, translations, Galilean boosts and scale transformations.

Therefore, as one expects, their expressions do not explicitly contain the viscosity ν. Never-

theless, such symmetries hold only in the viscous case, in the sense that the corresponding

symmetries for the inviscid situation cannot be reproduced by those for ν

= 0 by setting

Here we shall limit ourselves to deal with the rotational symmetry deﬁned by the gener-

ν = 0.

A more systematic treatment of the symmetry properties of the NSF model together with

the investigation of the role of the boundary conditions will be reported in a separated paper.

The operator (4) gives rise to a reduced NSF (RNSF) system whose last equation is

can be interpreted as the radial and the azimuthal components of the (reduced) velocity U,

and U3 is the component along the z-axis.

We ﬁnd that the RNSF system admits two solutions which are, respctively, i) the circular

Couette ﬂow (in which only the azimuthal component U2 of U is diﬀerent from zero), and

ii) a ﬂow where all the three components of U are diﬀerent from zero. In this case U3 turns

out to be time dependent in such a way that U3 →
variable µ0t goes to inﬁnity (see (14)). In the original velocity components u1, u2 and u3

The reduced solution (7) is pertinent to a steady ﬂow where the ﬂuid occupies the gap

In Fig. 1 we show the behavior of the temperature ﬁeld, as being described by the

solution (9), as a function of t and r (brighter regions correspond to higher values of T ). By

exploiting the scale invariance of the NSF system we can express the physical constants in

an adimensional form [12]. Hereafter we will assume ν = 10−2, ρ = 1, η = 10−2, Cp = 1,

κ = 6

10−3. After a transient phase, only the contribution (10), due to the dissipative term

×

in (3) survives. In this situation we have a maximum of T for any t in the gap between the

two cylinders. This maximum, as shown in Fig. 2 for the asymptotic case, can continuously

vary by varying ∆T (or equivalently λ2).

An interesting physical interpretation of the vortex solution presented in Case ii) is the

following. Let us consider a device constituted by two rotating porous coaxial cylinders of

radii r1 < r2 containing in the gap a ﬂuid of kinematic viscosity ν.

Let γ = u0r1

ν be the radial Reynolds number, and u0 ≡

U1(r1) the radial velocity through

the wall of the inner cylinder [4]. We assume that the ﬂow is inward for γ < 0 and outward

7

for γ > 0. For A0 = A1 = 0, the velocity ﬁled reproduces the solution investigated in [4].

Furthermore, for γ = 0 the quantities (12) correspond to the Couette ﬂow (7). In the case of

porous cylinders, A and B are related to the geometry and the dynamics of the device, and

explicitly become: A =

[Ω1a2(1

where a = r1/r2 and b = Ω2/Ω1.

In general, i.e.

= 0, the evolution equation (5) for the temperature is very

complicated and the ﬁnding of exact solutions is a diﬃcult task. However, for A0 = A1 = 0,

we obtain

be

= 1 and γ > 0 (i.e. the radial ﬂow is considered outward) to avoid singularities.

To determine the time behavior of the coordinates (x(t), y(t), z(t)) of the ﬂuid particle, we

integrate the velocity ﬁeld u = (u1, u2, u3) to get r2 = 2Ct + r2

0, where x and y obey the pair

of equations of the time-dependent oscillator type which aﬀord the solutions x = √τ cos ψ,

y = √τ sin ψ where τ = 2Ct + r2

The term (16) is again due to the presence of the dissipation rate in (3), and represents

the asymptotic limit of the solution (15), for t

. In Fig. 4 we plot the temperature

→ ∞

ﬁeld (15) for z = 0.5. This plot is analogous to that of Fig. (1). In other words, also in this

case a maximum of T emerges after a transient phase.

The position at which Tmax is located in the gap r1 ≤

r

≤

r2 (Fig. 5) depends on the

value of γ, on the diﬀerence of temperature ∆T and quadratically on the width of the gap.

In particular, Tmax tends to migrate towards the well of the outer cylinder when the values

of γ increase and vice-versa. A similar situation occurs when ∆T changes.

In Figs. 6 and 7 we plot the thermal ﬁeld for b = Ω2

0 and b < 0, when ∆T = 0 and

To conclude, from our analysis of the temperature behavior of vortices of the NSF model

(1)-(3), notable thermal eﬀects arise as a consequence of the presence of the energy dis-

sipation term in the evolution equation (3) for the temperature ﬁeld. We hope that our

theoretical results can stimulate some experimental work addressed to a possible evidence

of such eﬀects.

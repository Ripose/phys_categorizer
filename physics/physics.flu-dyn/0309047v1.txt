Abstract

Relative dispersion in a neutrally stratiﬁed planetary boundary
layer (PBL) is investigated by means of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES).
Despite the small extension of the inertial range of scales in the simu-
lated PBL, our Lagrangian statistics turns out to be compatible with
the Richardson t3 law for the average of square particle separation.
This emerges from the application of nonstandard methods of analy-
sis through which a precise measure of the Richardson constant was
0.5 in close agreement
also possible. Its values is estimated as C2 ∼
with recent experiments and three-dimensional direct numerical sim-
ulations.

1 Introduction

One of the most striking features of a turbulent planetary boundary layer
(PBL) is the presence of a wide range of active length scales. They range
from the smallest dynamically active scales of the order of millimeters (the
so-called Kolmogorov scale), below which diﬀusive eﬀects are dominant, to
the largest scales of the order of ten kilometers. Such a large range of excited

1

scales are essentially a continuum and the distribution of energy scale-by-
scale is controlled by the famous Kolmogorov’s 1941 prediction (see Frisch,
1995 for a modern presentation).
One of the most powerful concepts which highlighted the dynamical role of
the active scales in the atmosphere was due to Richardson (1926). He intro-
duced in his pioneering work the concept of turbulent relative dispersion (see
Sawford, 2001 for a recent review) with the aim of investigating the large
variations of atmospheric turbulent diﬀusion when observed at diﬀerent spa-
tial scales.
In his work, Richardson proposed a diﬀusion equation for the probability den-
sity function, p(r, t), of pair separation. Assuming isotropy such an equation
can be cast into the form

∂p(r, t)
∂t

=

1
r2

∂
∂r (cid:20)

r2D(r)

∂p(r, t)
∂r

(cid:21)

where the scale-dependent eddy-diﬀusivity D(r) accounts for the enormous
increase in observed values of the turbulent diﬀusivity in the atmosphere.
r4/3 was obtained by Richardson (1926)
The famous scaling law D(r)
from experimental data. From the expression of D(r) as function of r and
exploiting Eq. (1) the well known non-Gaussian distribution

∝

p(r, t)

−9/2 exp

∝

is easily obtained.
This equation implies that the mean square particle separation grows as

R2(t)

r2(t)

= C2ǫt3

≡ h

i

which is the celebrated Richardson’s “t3” law for the pair dispersion. Here
C2 is the so-called Richardson constant and ǫ is the mean energy dissipation.
Despite the fact that the Richardson’s law has been proposed since a long
time, there is still a large uncertainty on the value of C2. Some authors have
10−1 in kinematic simulations (see, for
found C2 ranging from
example, Elliot and Majda, 1996; Fung and Vassilicos, 1998), although for
kinematic models an energy ﬂux ǫ can hardly be deﬁned. On the other hand,
O(1) (and even larger) follows from closure predictions (Monin
a value C2 ∼
and Yaglom, 1975). More recently, both an experimental investigation (Ott
and Mann, 2000) and accurate three-dimensional direct numerical simula-
tions (DNS) (Boﬀetta and Sokolov, 2002) give a strong support for the value

10−2 to

C2 ∼
The main limitation of the state-of-the-art three-dimensional DNS is that
the achieved Reynolds numbers are still far from those characterizing the
so-called fully developed turbulence regime, that is the realm of the Richard-
son’s (1926) theory. Moreover, initial and boundary conditions assumed in
the most advanced DNS are, however, quite idealized and do not match those
characterizing a turbulent PBL, the main concern of the present paper.
For all these reasons we have decided to focus our attention on Large-Eddy
Simulations (LES) of a neutrally stratiﬁed PBL and address the issue related
to the determination of the Richardson constant C2. The main advantage of
this strategy is that it permits to achieve very high Reynolds numbers and,
at the same time, it properly reproduces the dynamical features observed in
the PBL.
It is worth anticipating that the naive approach which should lead to the
determination of C2 by looking at the behavior of R2(t) versus the time t is
extremely sensitive to the initial pair separations and thus gives estimations
of the Richardson’s constant which appear quite questionable (see Fig. 3).
This is simply due to the fact that, in realistic situations like the one we
consider, the inertial range of scales is quite narrow and, consequently, there
is no room for a genuine t3 regime to appear (see Boﬀetta et al., 2000 for
general considerations on this important point).
This fact motivated us to apply a recently established ‘nonstandard’ analysis
technique (the so-called FSLE approach, Boﬀetta et al., 2000) to isolate a
clear Richardson regime and thus to provide a reliable and systematic (that
is independent from initial pair separations) measure for C2. This is the main
aim of our paper.

2 The LES strategy

In a LES strategy the large scale motion (that is motion associated to the
largest turbulent eddies) is explicitly solved while the smallest scales (typi-
cally in the inertial range of scales) are described in a statistical consistent
way (that is parameterized in terms of the resolved, large scale, velocity and
temperature ﬁelds). This is done by ﬁltering the governing equations for
velocity and potential temperature by means of a ﬁlter operator. Applied,
for example, to the ith-component of the velocity ﬁeld, ui, (u1 = u, u2 = v,

3

u3 = w), the ﬁlter is deﬁned by the convolution:

ui(x) =

ui(x′)G(x

x′)dx′

Z

−

where ui is the ﬁltered ﬁeld and G(x) is a three-dimensional ﬁlter function.
The ﬁeld component ui can be thus decomposed as

ui = ui + u

′′
i

and similarly for the temperature ﬁeld. In our model, the equation for the
latter ﬁeld is coupled to the Navier–Stokes equation via the Boussinesq term.
Applying the ﬁlter operator both to the Navier–Stokes equation and to the
equation for the potential temperature, and exploiting the decomposition
(5) (and the analogous for the temperature ﬁeld) in the advection terms one
obtains the corresponding ﬁltered equations:

Details on the LES model we used in our study can be found in Moeng, 1984
and in Sullivan et al., 1994. Such a model has been widely used and tested
to investigate basic research problems in the framework of boundary layer
ﬂows (see, for example, Antonelli et al., 2003 and Moeng and Sullivan, 1994
among the others).

3 The simulated PBL

In order to obtain a stationary PBL we advanced in time our LES code
for around six large-eddy turnover times, τ∗, with a spatial resolution of 1283
grid points. This time will be the starting point for the successive Lagrangian
analysis (see next section).
The relevant parameters characterizing our simulated PBL are listed in Table

In order to investigate the statistics of pair dispersion, from the time t = 6 τ∗
(corresponding to the PBL stationary state) we integrated, in parallel to the
LES, the equation for the passive tracer trajectories deﬁned by the equation

˙x(t) = u(x(t), t).

R(0) = 2∆x, ∆x being the grid mesh spacing whose value is 15.6 m. Tra-
jectories have been integrated for a time of the order of 5000 s with a time
step of around 1 s, the same used to advance in time the LES.
At the initial time, pairs are uniformly distributed on a horizontal plane
placed at the elevation zi/2. Reﬂection has been assumed both at the cap-
ping inversion (at the elevation zi) and at the bottom boundary.
For testing purposes, a second run (again started from t = 6 τ∗) with a
smaller number of pairs (5000) has been performed. No signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences in the Lagrangian statistics have been however observed. The same
conclusion has been obtained for a second test where the LES spatial resolu-
tion has been lowered to 963 grid points. For a comparison see Figs. 3 and 4.
The velocity ﬁeld necessary to integrate (14) has been obtained by a bilinear
interpolation from the eight nearest grid points on which the velocity ﬁeld
produced by the LES is deﬁned.
In this preliminary investigation, we did not use any sub-grid model describ-
ing the Lagrangian contribution arising from the motion on scales smaller
than the grid mesh spacing.

sion vs the (dimensionless) time. Full line: the initial separation is ∆x;
Dashed-line: the initial separation is 2∆x. Dotted line is relative to the t3
Richardson’s law.

4.1 Pair dispersion statistics

In Fig. 3 we show the second moment of relative dispersion R2(t) for the two
initial separations. Heavy dashed line represents the expected Richardson’s
law, which is however not compatible with our data for the largest initial
separation 2∆x. We can also notice how the R2(t) curve becomes ﬂatter for
larger separations. The same dependence has been observed by Boﬀetta and
Celani (2000) for pair dispersion in two-dimensional turbulence.

The fact that our data do not ﬁt the Richardson law, for generic initial
pair separations, is simply explained as a consequence of ﬁnite size eﬀects
Indeed, it is clear that, unless t is
(in space and in time) of our system.
large enough that all particle pairs have “forgotten” their initial conditions,
the average will be biased. This is why we observe a consistent ﬂattening of
R2(t) at small times. Such regime is a crossover from initial conditions to
the Richardson regime. From Fig. 3 we can see that the extension of such

8

crossover increases as the initial separation increases.
Unfortunately, we cannot augment the time t too much because of the re-
duced extension of our inertial range (see Fig. 2). To overcome this problem,
and thus to allow a systematic estimation of the Richardson constant which
does not depend on the choice of the initial pair separation, we use an alter-
native approach based on statistics at ﬁxed scale (Boﬀetta et al., 2000). This
is the subject of the next subsection.

4.2 Fixed-scale statistics

The characterization of transport properties in multi-scale systems, such as
models of turbulent ﬂuids, is a delicate task, especially when exponents of
scaling laws and/or universal constants are to be measured from Lagrangian
statistics. Additional diﬃculties arise in all cases where the standard asymp-
totic quantities, for example the diﬀusion coeﬃcients, cannot be computed
correctly, for limitations due essentially to the ﬁnite size of the domain and to
ﬁnite spatio-temporal resolution of the data. As we have seen in the previous
subsection for the LES trajectories, the mean square relative dispersion, seen
as a function of time, is generally aﬀected by overlap eﬀects between diﬀer-
ent regimes. We therefore use a mathematical tool known as Finite-Scale
Lyapunov Exponent, brieﬂy FSLE, a technique based on exit-time statistics
at ﬁxed scale of trajectory separation, formerly introduced in the framework
of chaotic dynamical systems theory (for a review see Boﬀetta et al., 2000,
and references therein).
A dynamical system consists, basically, of a N-dimensional state vector x,
having a set of N observables as components evolving in the so-called phase
space, and of a N-dimensional evolution operator F , related by a ﬁrst-order
ordinary diﬀerential equations system:

If F is nonlinear, the system (15) can have chaotic solutions, that is limited
predictability, for which case an inﬁnitesimally small error δx on a trajectory
x is exponentially ampliﬁed in time:

(15)

(16)

with a (mean) growth rate λ known as Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE).
The FSLE is based on the idea of characterizing the growth rate of a trajec-

˙x(t) = F [x].

tory perturbation in the whole range of scales from inﬁnitesimal to macro-
scopic sizes. In the Lagrangian description of ﬂuid motion, the vector x is
the tracer trajectory, the operator F is the velocity ﬁeld, and the error δx
is the distance between two trajectories. It is therefore straightforward to
consider the relative dispersion of Lagrangian trajectories as a problem of
ﬁnite-error predictability.

At this regard, the FSLE analysis has been applied in a number of re-
cent works as diagnostics of transport properties in geophysical systems (see,
for example, Lacorata et al., 2001; Joseph and Legras, 2002; LaCasce and
Ohlmann, 2003).

The procedure to deﬁne the FSLE is the following. Let r =

thresholds, δ1, δ2,

is the mean exit-time of r from the threshold δ = δi, in other
where
words the mean time taken for r to grow from δ to ρδ. The FSLE depends
very weakly on ρ if ρ is chosen not much larger than 1. The factor ρ cannot
be arbitrarily close to 1 because of ﬁnite-resolution problems and, on the
other hand, must be kept suﬃciently small in order to avoid contamination
eﬀects between diﬀerent scales of motion. In our simulations we have ﬁxed
ρ = √2. For inﬁnitesimal δ, the FSLE coincides with the MLE. In general,
for ﬁnite δ, the FSLE is expected to follow a power law of the type:

λ(δ)

δ−2/γ

(18)

∼
where the value of γ deﬁnes the dispersion regime at scale δ, for example:
γ = 3 refers to Richardson diﬀusion within the turbulence inertial range;
γ = 1 corresponds to standard diﬀusion, that is large-scale uncorrelated
spreading of particles. These scaling laws can be explained by dimensional
argument: if the scaling law of the relative dispersion in time is of the form
r2(t)
tγ, the inverse of time as function of space gives the corresponding
scaling (18) of the FSLE. In our case, indeed, we seek for a power law related
to Richardson diﬀusion, inside the inertial range of the LES:

∼

λ(δ) = αδ−2/3

10

(19)

where α is a constant depending on the details of the numerical experi-
ment. The corresponding mean square relative separation is expected to
follow Eq. (3). A formula can be derived, which relates the FSLE to the
Richardson’s constant (Boﬀetta and Sokoloﬀ, 2002):

where β is a numerical coeﬃcient equal to 1.75, ǫ is the energy dissipation

data. Information about the existence of the inertial range is also given by a
quantity related to the FSLE, the mean relative Lagrangian velocity at ﬁxed

dimensionally equivalent to λ(δ), and, in conditions of suﬃcient isotropy, it
represents the spectrum of the relative dispersion rate in real space. A scaling

5 Conclusions and perspectives

We have investigated the problem of relative dispersion in a neutrally strat-
iﬁed planetary boundary layer simulated by means of Large-Eddy Simula-
tions. In particular, our attention has been focused on the possible emergence
of the celebrated Richardson’s law ruling the separation in time of particle
pairs.
The diﬃculties in observing such behavior in a realistic PBL mainly rely on
the fact that it is hard to obtain a PBL with a suﬃciently extended inertial
range of scales. For this reason, standard techniques to isolate the Richard-
son’s law and the relative constant turn out to be inconclusive, the results
being strongly dependent, for instance, on the choice of the initial pair sepa-
rations. To overcome this problem, we have applied, for the ﬁrst time in the
context of boundary layer physics, a recently established technique coming
from the study of dynamical systems. As a result, a clean region of scaling
showing the occurrence of the Richardson law has been observed and an ac-
curate, systematic, measure of the Richardson constant became possible. Its
0.2), where the error bar has been determined in a very
value is C2 = (0.5
conservative way. Such estimation is compatible with the one obtained from
Fig. 3 in the case of initial pair separation equal to ∆x. The important point
is that the new strategy gives a result that, by construction, does not depend
on the initial pair separations. As already emphasized this is not the case
for the standard approach.

±

Clearly, our study is not the end of the story. The following points appear

to be worth investigating in a next future.
The ﬁrst point is related to the fact that in our simulations we did not use any
sub-grid model for the unresolved Lagrangian motions. The main expected
advantage of SGS Lagrangian parameterizations is to allow the choice of ini-
tial pair separations smaller than the grid mesh spacing, a fact that would
cause a reduction of the crossover from initial conditions to the genuine t3
law. The investigation of this important point is left for future research.
Another point is related to the investigation of the probability density func-
tion (pdf) of pair separation. In the present study, we have focused on the
sole second moment of this pdf. There are, indeed, several solutions for the
diﬀusion equation (1) all giving pdfs compatible with the t3 law. The so-
lution for the pdf essentially depends on the choice for the eddy-diﬀusivity
ﬁeld, D(r). The answer to this question concerns applicative studies related,
for example, to pollutant dispersion because of the importance of correctly

13

describing the occurrence of extreme, potentially dangerous, events.
Finally, it is also interesting to investigate whether or not the Richardson law
rules the behavior of pair separations also in buoyancy-dominated boundary
In this case, the role of buoyancy could modify the expression for
layers.
the eddy-diﬀusivity ﬁeld, D(r), thus giving rise to an essentially new regime
which is however up to now totally unexplored.

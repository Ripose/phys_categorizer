In this communication, we would like to comment on

some results in a recent Letter by Kafesaki et al. [1].

In [1], the authors stated “Up to now the extensive
studies of bubbly water (or other bubbly liquids) have
been analyzed in the framework of single scattering”.
In fact, acoustic scattering by bubbles has also been
studied in terms of multiple scattering both extensively
and intensively in the literature. This includes both
theoretical (e. g. [2–12]) and experimental works (e. g.
[13,14]). The work of Foldy [15], Lax [16], Waterman
et al. [17], and Twersky [18] serves as a solid foun-
dation to the multiple scattering of acoustic waves by
many scatterers in general. The textbook by Ishimaru
[19] presents an excellent account of various theories
about the multiple scattering. The authors further sug-
gested “Thus, acoustic waves in bubbly liquids (espe-
cially water), in addition to being very important per
se, provide an almost ideal case for examining in detail
the localization question”. We note that the research
on multiple-scattering induced acoustic localization in
random bubbly water is rich (e. g. [4,5,11,20–24]). It
has been shown [11,23,24] that acoustic waves can be
localized within a range of frequencies slightly above
the natural frequency of an air-bubble in water, and
the localization behavior is insensitive to the conﬁgu-
ration of bubble clouds [22]. When waves are localized
in bubbly water, a global coherent behavior appears.
This is a distinct feature diﬀerentiating the localization
eﬀect from residual absorption [24,26,27]. The localiza-
tion disappears when the air-bubble volume fraction is
lower than about 10−5, in agreement with an earlier
prediction [4].

To the end of their Letter, Kafesaki [1] stated “The
most signiﬁcant and novel results we obtained are
shown in the panel of Fig. 3(b)...”. The results shown
in their Fig. 3(b) are a natural extension of the re-
sults of [11]. The formulation in [11] stems from the
work of Foldy [15] and Twersky [18] and has been doc-
umented in detail in [25,28]. The approach has also
been compared favorably with others in certain situa-
tions [25,28–30], and the results agree with the physical
intuition (e. g. [31]). Though not exact, the approach is
applicable for most frequencies considered in [1]. There
will be a small inaccuracy when ωrs/c exceeds 0.45 and
signiﬁcant inaccuracy is expected when ωrs/c > 1.

Using the formulations in [11,28] for acoustic trans-
mission and using the formulation in [32] for comput-
ing the acoustic band structure, we examine the results
in Fig. 3 of [1]. It should be noted that the formula-
tion in [11] only takes into account the pulsating mode,
while the formulation in [28] incorporates all possible

vibrational modes of the bubbles. The two approaches
agree well except at higher resonance frequencies of
ωrs/c ≈ 0.48 and 0.77 [1]. Thus, in the following, the
approach in [11] will be used.

Employing the same parameters as in [1], we re-
produce partial results in Fig. 1. For comparison, we
show the result for a single random conﬁguration (a)
and as well as the ensemble averaged result (b).
It
is clear that whether making ensemble average makes
not much diﬀerence for ωrs/c0 < 0.6.
In particular,
the ensemble average basically plays no role for fre-
quencies located around the complete band gap. Com-
pared to Fig. 3 in [1], there are several diﬀerences. (1)
The complete band gap is a little wider in the present
case, but is consistent with a transmission calculation,
following [22]. To further inspect the diﬀerence, we
have also computed the band structures at the air void
fraction of 10%, yielding nearly the same answer as
in Fig. 1(a) of [1].
(2) In contrast to [1], the trans-
mission in the present computation changes sharply
at the frequencies slightly above the natural frequency
of an air-bubble in water [2], which in fact leads to
a ﬁrst order phase transition from the extended state
to the localized state [22]. Exploring the diﬀerence,
we have considered possible eﬀects of the locations
of transmitting source and receiver on the transmis-
sion, and ﬁnd that the transmission is insensitive to
the positions of the transmitter and the receiver for
frequencies between ωrs/c0 = 0.0136 and about 0.3,
indicating that the discrepancy in the transmission be-
havior between the present results and that from [1]
is not caused by a diﬀerence in the source or receiver
location. The transmission at frequencies higher than
roughly ωrs/c0 = 0.3, however, is indeed sensitive to
the location of either transmitter or receiver. (3) In
Fig. 3 of [1], the range of inhibited transmission coin-
cides with the band gap, while in our case this is not
the case. In addition, our results show that the ran-
domness tends to smear out the transmission peak near
the upper band edge, consistent with 2D cases [27]. At
ﬁrst sight, the present inconsistency between the range
of the band gap and the range of the inhibited trans-
mission seems to suggest errors in our computation.
But, in fact, the the disagreement is due to the eﬀect
of the ﬁnite sample size. To elaborate, Fig. 2 shows the
results for diﬀerent sizes of bubble clouds, where the
eﬀect of ﬁnite sample size is obvious. The range of the
transmission inhibition shall agree with the band gap
when the sample size tends inﬁnity.

When the multiple scattering is switched oﬀ, the
eﬀect of ensemble average becomes more prominent,

Figure 1 (a) Left panel. Acoustic bands in a sim-
ple cubic array of air-bubbles in water. rs is the
bubble radius, ω is the angular frequency and c0
is the water velocity in the water. Air volume
fraction is 1%. Middle panel. Reduced trans-
mission coeﬃcient through the bubble array in
ordered (solid line) or one random (dotted line)
placement. Right panel. The same as in the
middle panel, but with the multiple scattering
switched oﬀ.
(b) The same as in (a), but the
transmission in the case of random placement is
averaged over 100 random conﬁgurations.

Figure 2 The same as in Fig. 1, but for various sizes
of bubble clouds in ordered placement (a) and as
well as for one random arrangement (b).

comparing the dotted lines in the right panels in
Fig. 1(a) and (b). Again we see discrepancies with
Fig. 3 in [1]. For example, the present result for the
lattice case starts to ﬂat out at about ωrs/c0 = 0.3,
while that in [1] at about 0.4. The randomness tends
to broad the transmission peak located around the
natural frequency of the breathing mode of the air-
bubble. The two transmission peaks at ωrs/c0 = 0.48
and 0.77 shown in [1] are absent from the right panel of
Fig. 1. This is because the results in Fig. 1 did not take
into consideration higher vibrational modes. When the
higher modes are considered using [28], the overall re-
sults in the right panel of Fig. 1 will not change much,
except that two sharp transmission peaks will appear
as in Fig. 3(c) of [1].

The nonlinear dynamics of the free surface of an ideal dielectric liquid in a strong

electric ﬁeld is studied. The equation for the evolution of surface electrohydrody-

namic waves is derived in the approximation of small surface-slope angles.

It is

established that the equation can be solved for liquids with suﬃciently high val-

ues of the permittivity. This makes it possible to describe the interaction of the

counter-propagating waves.

It is well known [1] that the tangential electric ﬁeld, as opposed to the normal electric

ﬁeld, has a stabilizing eﬀect on the free surface of a dielectric liquid. The dispersion relation

for the surface waves propagating along the electric ﬁeld direction has the following form

[2, 3]:

where k is the wave number, ω is the frequency, g is the acceleration of gravity, s is the

surface tension coeﬃcient, ρ is the mass density, E is the external electric ﬁeld strength,
1)2/(ε + 1), and ε is the dielectric constant of a ﬂuid (we use the cgs electrostatic

system of units). It is seen from this relation that, if the electric ﬁeld is suﬃciently strong
(E2

will travel without dispersion, i.e., ω

k. Their propagation is described by the linear wave

equation [1]

general solution is

where η(x, t) is the elevation of the free surface, and c is the (constant) wave velosity. Its

η(x, t) = f (x + ct) + g(x

ct),

−

where f and g are arbitrary functions that play the role of the Riemann invariants (they are

constant along the corresponding characteristics). The problem of taking into account the

system nonlinearities amounts to studying the manner in which the Riemann invariants of

the linear wave equation will evolve under their inﬂuence.

For the classical problem of long waves in shallow water, the evolution of the surface is also

described (in the linear approximation) by the equation (2). As is known (see, for example,

Ref. [4]), the nonlinearity determines the tendency for the formation of singularities. Such

tendency can be suppressed by the linear dispersion inﬂuence. The asymptotic behaviour

of the (adiabatic) Riemann invariants is then described by the Korteweg–de Vries equation.

Below we will demonstrate that, when investigating the nonlinear waves on the surface of a

deep ﬂuid layer subjected to a strong tangential electric ﬁeld, we encounter the situation of a

fundamentally diﬀerent kind. The point is that, for liquids with high ε values, the Riemann

invariants of the linear wave equation, taken separately, are not distorted by nonlinearities.

3

Of course, this is not to say that the nonlinearity inﬂuence can be neglected. The nonlinearity

is responsible for the interaction of the oppositely directed waves.

Note that the inﬂuence of the nonlinearity on the waves propagating on the surface of a

ﬂuid in a tangential electric or magnetic ﬁeld (these problems are similar from the math-

ematical point of view) is usually investigated in the quasi-monochromatic approximation

(see [5, 6] and the references therein). This approach allows one to obtain immediately a

nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation for the complex amplitude of travelling waves and, in so

doing, to circumvent the diﬃculties associated with the necessity of analysing the nonlinear

integro-diﬀerential equations that result from reducing the original equations of motion to

lower dimensional equations for the surface evolution. In the present work it will be shown

that, in the strong-ﬁeld limit, such integro-diﬀerential equations can be solved and, conse-

quently, the condition of quasi-monochromaticity can be replaced by the weaker condition

(1).

Consider the potential motion of an ideal liquid of inﬁnite depth in an external tangential

electric ﬁeld (the potential ﬂow approximation holds if the characteristic wavelength λ far

exceeds the penetration depth of the vortex motion

ν/ω, where ν is the kinematic viscosity

of the ﬂuid [7]). We assume that, in the unperturbed state, the boundary of the liquid is a

p

ﬂat horizontal surface z = 0 (the z axis is normal to the surface of the liquid), and the electric

ﬁeld vector is directed along the x axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. The function

η(x, t) speciﬁes the deviation of the boundary from the plane, i.e., the liquid occupies the

region z < η(x, t).

The velosity potential for an incompressible liquid Φ satisﬁes the Laplace equation

surface is determined by the kinematic relation:

The electric potentials ϕ and ϕ′ satisfy the Laplace equations

Since the electric ﬁeld potential and normal component of the displacement vector have to

be continuous at the interface, we should add the following conditions at the boundary:

where ∂n denotes the derivative along the normal to the surface z = η. The system of

equations is closed by the condition of the electric ﬁeld uniformity at an inﬁnite distance

from the surface:

The above-written equations of motion have a Hamiltonian structure, and the functions
|z=η are canonically conjugated quantities [9, 10]:

η(x, t) and ψ(x, t) = Φ

It is convenient to introduce perturbations of the electric-ﬁeld potentials:

These nonlinear nonlocal equations describe the evolution of small-amplitude surface waves.

The function ψ was eliminated from the right-hand side of this equation with the help of
the expression ψx = ˆHηt + O(α), which follows from (10). One can see that in the linear

approximation, i.e., in the limit α

0, the equation (11) transforms into the linear wave

equation of the form (2) and, consequently, it describes the dispersionless wave propagation.

Consider the inﬂuence of nonlinearity on the waves that travel along or against the

direction of the x axis. We will seek a solution of (11) in the form

η(x, t) = ˜η(y, τ ),

where y = x

where the Hilbert transform operator acts with respect to the variable y. Unfortunately,

this nonlinear integro-diﬀerential equation cannot be solved in the general case. One can

assume that it describes the formation of singularities in a ﬁnite time. This process may

be suppressed by the inﬂuence of linear dispersion which should be taken into account for a

ﬁnite-depth ﬂuid layer.

Let us restrict our consideration to the degenerate case

when the equation (12) becomes trivial:

γ(ε)

1 = O(α),

−

˜ητ = O(α).

This means that the quadratic nonlinearities have no eﬀect on the wave propagation, i.e.,

the nonlinearity does not distort the Riemann invariants of the linear wave equation.

It can easily be seen that the condition (13) holds for dielectric liquids with suﬃciently

high values of the permittivity ε. Indeed, since γ

Let, for example, α = 0.1, i.e., the wave amplitude be an order of magnitude less than the

characteristic wavelength, and the considered small-angle approximation is quite applicable.

Then the condition (14), i.e., the condition ε

O(10), is certainly valid for such liquids as

in experiments.

Now consider the evolution of the free surface of a liquid with high permittivity within the

framework of the equation (11) describing the waves travelling in both possible directions.
Putting γ = 1 we, up to terms of order O(α2), obtain:

Thus, if the condition (14) holds true, it is possible to pass from the integro-diﬀerential

where we can set ˜F = 0 and ˜G = 0 without loss of generality. An important feature of the

described scheme for solving the equation (15) is that the leading-order solution is the sum

of the exact particular solutions (16) and (17). Otherwise, such procedure would give rise to

secular terms, i.e., the terms that grow algebraically with x or t. As a result, the conditions
of applicability of the perturbation theory would be violated for t > α−1 and

the interacting counter-propagating solitary waves preserve their initial shapes and phases.

Thus, we have described the interaction of the counter-propagating waves on the surface

of an ideal dielectric liquid in the presence of a strong tangential electrical ﬁeld. It turns out

that, even in the dispersionless case, the nonlinear evolution of the system does not result

in the formation of singularities (e.g. wave breaking) if the condition (14) is satisﬁed. As a

consequence, the interaction of nonlinear waves does not lead to the energy transfer towards

small spatial scales.

It should be noted that the results of the above investigation can be extended to the case

of a ferroﬂuid in a tangential magnetic ﬁeld. All one has to do is to replace the electric ﬁeld

E by the magnetic ﬁeld H and the permittivity ε by the magnetic permeability µ. In so

doing the condition (14) for the applicability of the solution (20) turns into the inequality

µ

O(α−1), which can be valid for some ferroﬂuids.

≥
An analogous approach can be applied to describe the wave propagation at the interface

of two liquids with diﬀerent permittivities ε1 and ε2. In the limiting case when the Atwood

number A = (ρ1

ρ2)/(ρ1 + ρ2) tends to unity (then the upper ﬂuid has no inﬂuence on the

−

boundary motion), all the above results remain valid with the only correction that ε is now

the permittivity ratio, ε = ε1/ε2.

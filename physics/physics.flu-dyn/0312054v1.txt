Our experiments and molecular dynamics simulations on a projectile penetrating a two-
dimensional granular medium reveal that the mean deceleration of the projectile is constant and
proportional to the impact velocity. Thus, the time taken for a projectile to decelerate to a stop is
independent of its impact velocity. The simulations show that the probability distribution function
of forces on grains is time-independent during a projectile’s penetration of the medium. At all times
the force distribution function decreases exponentially for large forces.

Craters on the earth and moon are similar to craters
formed in laboratory experiments at much lower energies
using projectiles and explosives [1, 2, 3]. In laboratory
experiments at large impact energies, narrow jets have
been observed to rise even higher than the initial height of
the projectile [4, 5]. Recent experiments have determined
how the morphology, depth, and width of craters formed
in granular media depend on the energy of the impact
projectile [6, 7]. These observations of the surfaces of the
craters give insight into the scaling laws as a function of
the projectile energy, but there is little known about the
dynamics of a projectile during crater formation.

We have studied the time evolution of projectile mo-
tion. Our experiments and molecular dynamics simula-
tions on a two-dimensional granular medium of high area
fraction yield the time dependence of the drag force on
projectiles. Simulations for the same initial conditions
also yield the time evolution of the forces on all of the
particles; hence, we can study the time dependence of the
force probability distribution function at diﬀerent stages
of the projectile motion.

Our observations and simulations reveal three distinct
regimes of the motion, as illustrated in Fig. 1: impact,
where the projectile ﬁrst hits the granular medium; pene-
tration, where a transient crater forms and grains in front
of the projectile are ﬂuidized; collapse, where the pro-
jectile has almost stopped and the deep transient crater
collapses, forming a static crater that remains visible on
the surface.

Methods — In the experiment, a projectile of diame-
ter D = 4.46 cm and mass 32.2 g was dropped into a
bed of small particles (cylinders) contained between two
glass plates with a separation 1.1 times the length of
the cylinders. The initial projectile heights h (h < 80
cm) correspond to impact velocities up to 400 cm/s. To
reduce crystallization, two sizes of small particles were
used: 12600 particles (84% of the total number) had di-
ameter d1 = 0.456 cm (mass m1 = 0.049 g) and 2400
particles had diameter d2 = 0.635 cm (mass m2 = 0.097

FIG. 1: Snapshots of a projectile in the three distinct regimes
of its motion in a bidisperse mixture of particles (cylinders).
Experiment: The larger cylinders of the bidisperse mixture
are colored black for visualization and are 40% larger in di-
ameter than the grey cylinders. Simulation: the shading of
each particle is proportional to the sum of the magnitudes
of all the forces acting on that particle; this renders visible
the instantaneous force chains. The projectile is 9.8 times as
large in diameter and 657 times as massive as the smallest
particles.

g). To obtain a uniform granular bed with a reproducible
area fraction before each drop of the projectile, the bed
was ﬂuidized with an air ﬂow that was slowly reduced to
zero, yielding the same bed height (65d1) and area frac-
tion (81 ± 2%) for each projectile drop. The bed width
was 225d1. The position of the projectile, y(t), deﬁned
as the distance between the bottom of the projectile and
the initial height of the bed, was determined with a high
speed camera and a center of mass particle tracking al-
gorithm [8].

We modelled the system with a soft-core molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulation that used 15, 000 disks that had
the same sizes and area fraction as the experiment. Any
two disks (one of which can be the projectile) exert the
following normal and tangential forces on one another:

~Fn = − [kδ + mrγn|~vn|θ(~vn)] ˆn
~Fs = min hmrγs|~vs|, µ| ~Fn|i ˆs,

where δ is the length of overlap [9, 10], ~vn and ~vs are
the normal and tangential components of the surface ve-
locity (ˆn and ˆs are unit vectors parallel to ~vn and ~vs),
k = 3.2 × 103 kg s−2 [11, 12, 13, 14] is proportional to
Young’s modulus, γn = 104 s−1 and γs = 8 × 103 s−1
are viscoelastic constants, µ = 0.28 is the static fric-
tion coeﬃcient, and mr is the reduced mass of the col-
liding particles. The Heaviside function θ in ~Fn models
an elastic-plastic interaction (e.g., see Fig. 8 of [15]);
the use of the Heaviside function distinguishes our force
model from previous soft core MD simulations [9, 14].
Our simple form for the tangential force is more com-
putationally eﬃcient than a more realistic form, but we
ﬁnd that the results obtained for a more realistic form for
~Fs [16] are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Simulations with
diﬀerent time steps showed that steps shorter than 1 µs
yielded the same results as 1 µs; a 1 µs time step was
used in the results presented here.

Results — The simulation results agree remarkably
well with the laboratory observations, as Fig. 2 illus-
trates. Both experiment and simulation reveal that the
time taken for a projectile to slow to a stop in the granu-
lar medium is independent of its velocity at impact. The
large deceleration of the projectile at impact (see Fig. 3)
is similar to that of a projectile incident to a liquid. How-
ever, in contrast to the behavior of a projectile in a ﬂuid
[17], in the granular medium there is a long penetra-
tion region in which the projectile’s average acceleration
is constant: y(t) is described by a parabola (Fig. 2(a)),
and vy(t) decreases linearly in time (Fig. 2(b)). Further,
the acceleration is proportional to the impact velocity,
as the inset in Fig. 2(b) illustrates: ay = αv0g, where
α = 0.0064 cm/s. Thus, the projectile slows almost to
a stop in a time t = 1/αg ≃ 0.15 s, independent of v0.
The projectile does not come to a complete stop; rather
it then moves very slowly downward over the next few
seconds as the particles in the bed make small rearrange-
ments in response to the collapse of the transient crater.
The drag force on the projectile, while constant on the
average, exhibits large ﬂuctuations, which have a f −2
spectrum (Fig. 3).

The simulation determines all of the forces on each
particle at every instance of time. Every force exerted by
a particle on the projectile during a short portion of its
travel is shown in Fig. 4. At each point in the projectile’s
trajectory only a few particles exert a signiﬁcant force on
the projectile. Each peak in the magnitude of the force

both experiment (◦) and simulation (solid lines). The two ver-
tical dashed lines give approximate boundaries between three
regions: impact, where the projectile rapidly decelerates (cf.
inset of Fig. 3); penetration, where the mean acceleration is
constant, as illustrated by a dashed line ﬁt in (a) of a parabola
to the results from experiment and simulation for each v0; and
collapse, where the projectile has almost stopped and the par-
ticles above it are collapsing to ﬁll the transient crater left by
the penetration. The ordinate for (b) for successive impact
velocities v0 < 363 cm/s are shifted by 30 cm/s for clarity.

between an individual particle and the projectile in Fig. 4
corresponds to a maximum force felt by the ﬁrst particle
in a force chain [18] that extends downward. Each force
chain consists of a string of particles in contact. The
sum of the magnitude of forces felt by each particle in this
chain is much greater than the average for the particles in
the bed, as can be seen in Fig. 1 (simulation), where dark
chains of particles extend downward from the projectile
into the particle bed.

Results for the probability distribution P (F, t) of nor-
mal contact forces between particles located in front of
the projectile in a semicircular region of radius 1.5D
centered at the bottom-most point of the projectile are
shown in Fig. 5. The distribution P (F, t) changes with
time during impact but is time invariant during pene-
tration: Fig. 5 shows the same distribution at times t2

particle in contact with the projectile during part of the pen-
etration regime (t ≈ 0.105 s in Figs. 2 and 3). Each force
grows, reaches a maximum and then decreases, representing
the creation and destruction of a force chain. Each type of
line represents a particular particle; thus, the particle that
appears at 12.344 cm is the same particle that reappears at

etration regime. The presence of an inﬂection point F ∗
in P (F, t) marks the beginning of exponential decay for
large F . The cross-over to an exponential distribution
at F ∗ increases linearly with v0, as shown in the inset
of Fig. 5. After the projectile has almost stopped, the
distribution is similar to that found in previous studies

of equilibrium force distributions [19, 20].

Discussion — Our experiments and simulations show
that the mean drag force on a projectile dropped into
a granular medium is constant during most of the pro-
jectile’s trajectory, and this drag force is proportional
to the projectile’s impact velocity.
In our experiments
Interestingly, previous ex-
inertia plays a major role.
periments with negligible inertial eﬀects, where cylinders
were pulled at a slow constant velocity through a gran-
ular bed, also yielded a drag force that was independent
of the velocity of the cylinder [21].

Since the deceleration of the projectile is proportional
to the impact velocity (see inset Fig. 2(b)), the projec-
tile penetration depth is also proportional to the impact
velocity. While our results are for a two-dimensional sys-
tem, this result has recently also been observed for pro-
jectile impact in a three-dimensional granular medium
[22].

The drag force on our projectile exhibits large ﬂuctu-
ations because at any instant the projectile is in contact
with only a few grains, and these contacts are contin-
ually formed and broken (Fig. 4). Fluctuations in the
drag force have also been observed for low velocity im-
pacts in experiments (v ≃ 0.1 cm/s) [21] and simulations
(v ≃ 2 cm/s)[9, 23, 24]. The spectrum corresponding to
the drag force time series for our projectile has a f −2
dependence, just as observed in measurements of ﬂuctu-
ations of the stress on a slowly sheared two-dimensional
granular medium [25] and in measurements of the torque
on a torsional pendulum in contact with a vibroﬂuidized
granular bed [26].

Finally, our simulations have yielded the normal con-
tact forces for all particles in the bed. The distribution
function for the forces on the particles in front of the
projectile rapidly evolves immediately after the projec-
tile makes contact with the bed, and then the distribu-
tion becomes stationary as the projectile penetrates the
bed. This stationary distribution decays exponentially
beyond an inﬂection point at F ∗. This is the ﬁrst deter-
mination of the force distribution for a granular medium
far from equilibrium, and the result is diﬀerent from the
result obtained for static beds [19, 20].

[11] As in most other MD simulations of granular media with
a soft core potential (e.g. [12, 13]), we use a value of k
that is far smaller than the physical value (106 kg s−2
for nylon) because a higher value is computationally too
expensive; the integration time must have the form δt ∝
k−1/2 for collisions to be modelled eﬀectively [14]. The
success of past [12, 13] and present MD simulations with
a small value of k indicates that the model, despite this
ﬂaw, captures much of the dissipative dynamics.

Introduction

Theoretical predictions of the continuum theory of the nematic liquid crystals (LC) were successfully

conﬁrmed in many experimental observations [1]. One of the most studied eﬀect is the inﬂuence of an

external ﬁeld on the orientational distribution of the LC director ﬁeld n(r). The physics involved in

a competition between the mechanical and ﬁeld forces that can be developed in LC media, calls for

careful analysis. Well known example is the Freedericksz eﬀect [1], observed when nematic LC cell with

initial uniform distribution of n(r) is subjected to an external magnetic ﬁeld. In many cases, the stabi-

lizing elastic forces compete with the destabilizing magnetic ﬁeld giving rise to a critical phenomenon.

However, the critical phenomena in LC can be sustained even if both the elastic and magnetic ﬁelds are

deﬁned as stabilizing. Such critical phenomena exist due to the eﬀect of surface tension which tends to

minimize the surface area by distorting the initial shape of the system.

The nematicity of LC’s, being a source for elastic properties, results in enhancement of stability

of LC jets [2], as compared to ordinary liquids. A similar stability enhancement appears in ordinary

liquid jets with isotropic magnetic permeability (see [3] and [4]) when they are subjected to an external

magnetic ﬁeld. Unlike the elasticity, the external ﬁeld has a critical value beyond which instability of the

jet is completely suppressed for all disturbance wavelengths [4]. Nematic LC’s are usually anisotropic

diamagnetics with positive anisotropy χa of the magnetic susceptibility [1]. This poses an additional

challenge with respect to the above mentioned phenomena. It is reﬂected by the extra terms in the LC

hydrodynamics due to orientational interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld H and LC director n.

The static version of capillary instability in liquid jets is known as the Plateau instability in the

liquid cylinders [2], [4]. It dates back to the classical works of J. Plateau [5] who deﬁned the problem of

ﬁnding a surface of liquid with a minimal area S given its boundary ∂Ω at ﬁxed volume. The problem

relates to the principle of minimum free energy at equilibrium. Further generalization is called for if the

excess free energy W , of the cylinder, comprises diﬀerent types of energy that reﬂect a more complex

structure of the liquid (e.g. elasticity [2] etc), as well as its capacity to interact with external ﬁelds.

The purpose of this work is to extend the theory of Plateau instability in LC cylinders [2] so as to

include the eﬀect of static magnetic ﬁelds. Here the motivation is both experimental and theoretical.

Experimentally, the question is how to set the initial orientation of director n collinear with the LC

cylinder axis. A weak magnetic ﬁeld can serve to this end. Theoretically, the framework outlined in [2]

can be extended so as to incorporate the inﬂuence of external ﬁelds on the evolution and stability of the

LC cylinder. In particular, the Plateau instability is studied with respect to the eﬀect of the magnetic

2 Free energy of LC cylinder in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld

Consider an isothermal incompressible LC cylinder in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld H0 that is applied in

free space along the cylinder axis. We assume a rigid boundary condition (BC) where the director is

tangentially anchored at the free surface of the LC cylinder. The magnetic susceptibility tensor

χ of the

LC is assumed anisotropic, symmetric, and independent of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the reference frame

b

related to the cylinder axis its diagonal terms are χk, χ⊥ while its oﬀ–diagonal term is χanznr, where
nz, nr are the axial and radial components of director n, respectively.

as r(z) = R + ζ0 cos kz, where k = 2π/Λ, Λ being the disturbance wavelength. Let the extent of

From the mathematical standpoint, the variational problem for minimization of W , supplemented with

instability can be studied assuming small perturbation in its shape. In this case the Plateau problem
becomes solvable in closed form. The ﬁelds inH(r) and exH(r), which must satisfy Maxwell equations,

Before going to further calculation of the excess free energy W by (13), let us estimate the main
contributions of the anisotropy χa to the distribution of the ﬁelds n(r, z) and inH1(r, z) in accordance

with (49) and (50).

First, as follows from Figure 2, G(kr) and G(kr) + G′(kr)

The next simpliﬁcation comes for n1

r(r, z).

Indeed, bearing in mind (50) we conclude that for the

inﬂuence of χa on n1

r(r, z) to be signiﬁcant a huge magnetic ﬁeld H0 is required

ﬁelds which are signiﬁcantly lower than H•, the behaviour of the director n(r) is dictated primarily by

competition between bulk elasticity and surface tension of the LC’s, and goverened by dimensionless

parameter κ = K/σR [2]. Recasting (46), (47) and (48) gives

n1
r(r, z) = kA2I1(kr) sin kz ,

r (r, z) = kA3K1(kr) sin kz ,

All the terms in (57), except the last one, describe the stabilization of a LC cylinder due to the existence

of isotropic susceptibility irrespective of its sign [4] and due to the elasticity of the LC phase [2]. The

inﬂuence of the last term in (57) which accounts for the anisotropy of χ can be signiﬁcant and even

dominating. The latter occurs if

as indeed is the case in classical LC materials (MBBA, PAA). Here the physical situation changes

completely. The cylinder is destabilized with the corresponding cut–oﬀ ksR

The interesting property of (59) is the fact that the cut–oﬀ ksR extends beyond the range (0

of the classical Rayleigh instability. This kind of extension cannot be obtained as a ﬁeld or elastic eﬀects

in the absence of anisotropy χa of the magnetic susceptibility.

The capillary instability of a LC cylinder in magnetic ﬁeld is considered using an energy approach.

The excess free energy, which includes terms due to surface, LC’s elasticity, and magnetic ﬁeld

is used to ﬁnd extremum conditions associated with instability. The boundary problem is solved

and then expanded in terms of the anisotropy χa of the magnetic susceptibility.

The excess magnetic free energy, which was founded to be a function of the isotropic susceptibility

(χ) squared proved to have an anisotropic part linear in χa. This indicates that the eﬀect of

anisotropy can turn dominant provided that 1

of anisotropy can be strong enough to counteract and even reverse the tendency of the ﬁeld to

| ≫

χ2

⊥. This means that the eﬀect

>

enhance stabilization by extending the cut–oﬀ ks wave number beyond the conventional range set

As the existence of magnetic anistropy is not limited to complex ﬂuids such as LC’s, the result of

this work can be considered of a more general nature.

It is quite surprising that among all above integrals there is only one (A9) which dominates over the

others in the region χ⊥ ≪

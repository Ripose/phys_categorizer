The structure of homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow is studied using data generated by Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS) and a linear analysis for both compressible and incompressible cases.
At large values of the mean shear rate, the Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) limit is approached.
Analytical solutions are found for the inviscid compressible RDT equations at long times. The
RDT equations are also solved numerically for both inviscid and viscous cases. The RDT solutions,
conﬁrmed by the DNS results, show that the even order transverse derivative moments of the dilata-
tional and solenoidal velocity ﬁelds are anisotropic, with the dilatational motions more anisotropic
than their solenoidal counterparts. The results obtained for the incompressible case are similar to
those obtained for the solenoidal motions in the compressible case. The DNS results also indicate
an increase in the anisotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments with the order of the
moment, in agreement with the RDT predictions. Although the anisotropy decreases with Reynolds
number, it is likely that for higher even order moments it will persist at large values of the Reynolds
number, in contrast with the postulate of local isotropy. The RDT solutions also predict that the
normalized odd order transverse derivative moments of the solenoidal velocity for the compressible
case and of the velocity for the incompressible case should approach a constant diﬀerent than zero
at large times. This prediction is supported by the DNS data. For higher odd order normalized mo-
ments, the RDT analysis suggests that the anisotropy may persist at large values of the Reynolds
number, in agreement with the experimental data. The ampliﬁcation of the dilatational kinetic
energy in the direction of the mean shear and the anisotropy of the dilatational dissipation tensor
found in the DNS results are also consistent with the RDT analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Most turbulent ﬂows are anisotropic at large scales. Homogeneous shear ﬂow represents one of the simplest
anisotropic ﬂows and its study can reveal important aspects of the structure and production of the turbulent ﬂuctua-
tions. The high Reynolds number experiment of Shen and Warhaft1 indicates that the higher odd order moments of
the velocity derivatives may not be consistent with the postulate of local isotropy, which requires that the normalized
odd order transverse derivative moments approach zero at large Reynolds numbers. This ﬁnding has important con-
sequences, since this postulate has been central for turbulence theories and models.2 Although DNS at high Reynolds
numbers are not feasible yet, persistent anisotropy in the skewness of velocity derivatives has been observed earlier in
the numerical results of Pumir,3 also conﬁrmed by Schumacher.4

The assumption of local isotropy also requires relations between the even order transverse derivative moments, which

should satisfy

, and similar relations for u2 and u3. There is experimental evidence that the

second order transverse derivative moments are not isotropic, especially when the mean rate of strain is signiﬁcant.5,6
Nevertheless, the anisotropy of the higher even order transverse moments of the velocity derivatives has not been
examined. In this study we point out a lack of isotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments in homogeneous
shear ﬂow for both incompressible and compressible cases with increased anisotropy for higher order moments. We
also show that the small scale dilatational motions are more anisotropic than their solenoidal counterparts, so that
the anisotropy increases for the compressible case. Moreover, the anisotropy of the even order transverse derivative
moments found in the DNS results is predicted by the RDT solutions. As the Reynolds number increases, the
anisotropy among the transverse derivative moments is expected to decrease. Since it is shown that the anisotropy
increases with the order of the moment, some anisotropy may persist for higher order moments at large values of the
Reynolds number. In addition, it is shown that the linear analysis predicts that the normalized odd order transverse

2

derivative moments of u1 should approach a constant diﬀerent than zero at large times, in agreement with the DNS
data. The RDT results suggest a persistent anisotropy of the higher odd order normalized transverse derivative
moments at large Reynolds number, in agreement with the experimental ﬁndings.1

There are numerous experimental investigations of incompressible homogeneous shear ﬂow,1,7,8,9 however, no such
study exists for the compressible case. Compressibility eﬀects in turbulent ﬂows are important in many practical
applications ranging from combustion processes, to high speed aerodynamics, and to astrophysical phenomena. Al-
though compressible turbulence has been the subject of intense research in the last 50 years, much less is known in
comparison with incompressible turbulence.10 In order to isolate the volume changes of the ﬂuid elements, the velocity
ﬁeld is usually decomposed into a solenoidal (divergence free) part and a dilatational part. For homogeneous ﬂows
this decomposition is unique up to an additive constant, which can be taken to be zero without the loss of generality.
Such decomposition in spectral space has been exploited by Rapid Distortion Theories in studies of shock-turbulence
interaction and homogeneous turbulence subject to bulk compression or uniform mean shear.11

For the RDT equations of incompressible homogeneous shear ﬂow, analytical solutions in wavenumber space are
known for the velocity ﬁeld in both viscous and inviscid cases.12 The integration of these solutions over the wavenumber
space can yield predictions for various quantities in real space. In general, only for very early and long times the
integrals can be evaluated analytically. Long time solutions for the velocity variances and shear stress are obtained
by Moﬀatt13 and Rogers.14 The early time evolution of the ﬂow is correctly captured by the RDT equations since the
non-normal ampliﬁcation mechanism is linear in time.15,16 However, due to the neglecting of the nonlinear terms and
thus the energy cascade to small scales, the RDT predictions can become eventually very diﬀerent than those of the
full nonlinear equations. Nevertheless, for the incompressible case, the RDT equations correctly capture the behavior
of various correlations coeﬃcients in the fully developed ﬂow ﬁeld.14

For the case of compressible homogeneous shear ﬂow in the RDT limit no analytical solutions are known. Simone
et al. 17 performed RDT simulations of homogeneous shear ﬂow and showed that the role of the distortion Mach
number, Md, on the time variation of the turbulent kinetic energy is consistent with that found in the DNS results.
They also identiﬁed diﬀerent time regimes in which the various contributions to the terms in the RDT equations in
spectral space change qualitatively, which might be the reason for the diﬀerence in the early and long time inﬂuence
of Md on the kinetic energy growth. However, in the absence of analytical solutions, it is diﬃcult to predict how each
wavenumber will aﬀect the result of the integration over the wavenumber space. For example, for the incompressible
case, Rogers14 shows that at long times most of the contribution to the velocity variances and shear stress comes from
a very narrow region in wavenumber space, which shrinks in time.

The DNS results for compressible homogeneous shear ﬂow of Blaisdell et al. 18 and Livescu et al. 19 reveal that the
explicit dilatational eﬀects tend to occur predominantly in the direction of the shear. Livescu and Madnia20 examined
the anisotropies of the solenoidal and dilatational motions for diﬀerent values of the Reynolds and turbulent Mach
numbers and found higher levels of anisotropy for the normal components of the dilatational dissipation tensor
compared with those of the normal components of the solenoidal dissipation tensor. By examining the energy transfer
leading to the anisotropy of the dilatational motions, Livescu et al. 19 showed that the nonlinear terms in the transport
equation for the kinetic energy components do not have a signiﬁcant contribution. This suggests that a linear
mechanism might be responsible for the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational motions in the direction of the shear.

The present study thus aims: (i) to point out a lack of isotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments
for both compressible and incompressible cases and show that this anisotropy is due to a linear mechanism, (ii)
to examine the ability of the linearized equations to predict the persistent anisotropy of the normalized odd order
transverse derivative moments found in the experimental data, and (iii) to clarify if the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational
kinetic energy and dilatational dissipation in the direction of the shear are also due to a linear mechanism. Moreover,
the diﬀerent levels of anisotropy of the small scale dilatational and solenoidal motions for the compressible case is
also discussed. Additionally, analytical solutions are presented for the RDT equations of compressible homogeneous
turbulent shear ﬂow.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the governing equations and their linearization in the RDT
limit. The numerical methodology for solving the full nonlinear and the RDT equations with the parameters for the
cases considered is presented in section III. Section IV contains an analysis of the RDT equations for compressible
homogeneous shear ﬂow. The inviscid RDT equations are solved analytically in the incompressible limit (Mt0S
0)
). For ﬁnite values of Mt0S and large times, analytical solutions are presented
and pressure release limit (Mt0S
for the Fourier modes of pressure and velocity components. In section V the analytical and numerical solutions of
the RDT equations are compared with the DNS results. It is shown that the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational kinetic
energy in the direction of the shear and the anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation
tensor are captured by the RDT equations. Also in this section, the anisotropy of the even and odd order transverse
derivative moments of the solenoidal and dilatational velocity ﬁelds for the compressible case and of the velocity ﬁeld
for the incompressible case are studied using DNS results and shown to be predicted by the RDT analysis. Summary
and conclusions are given in section VI.

The conservation equations which provide the mathematical model of the problem are the continuity, Navier-Stokes,
and energy transport equations. For a compressible homogeneous shear ﬂow (for which the mean, Favre averaged,
velocity is given by ˜u1 = Sx2 with S constant, ˜u2 = 0, and ˜u3 = 0) after Rogallo’s transformation of coordinates21

A. Linearized equations for compressible homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow

The linearized nondimensional equations of motion for density, ρ′, velocity, u′′i , and pressure, p′, ﬂuctuations in a
compressible homogeneous turbulent ﬂow are derived by Kovasznay.23 For the case of a homogeneous turbulent shear
ﬂow these equations correspond to the RDT limit, which assumes large values for the mean shear rate S. In the

with the right hand side of the equation given by viscous dissipation of the mean ﬂow.

Although in general the linearized equations form a coupled system of equations, for the inviscid case they can be
decoupled (note that in this case the mean pressure becomes constant). Thus, an equation for the dilatation can be
obtained by taking the divergence of Eq. (7)

systems are the opposite of the notations used by Rogers14. Due to the time variation of k2, Eq. (12) does not

and ˆd0 and ˆu20 are the initial values of the Fourier modes of the dilatation and velocity ﬂuctuations in x2 direction,
respectively. It can be seen that, if the initial value of the pressure mode scales with 1/Mt0 for constant (Mt0 S), then
ˆp′ depends on (Mt0S) and η only. This condition is fulﬁlled if the pressure ﬂuctuations are initialized with zero or
from a Poisson equation, which is the case with most DNS studies of homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow. Note that
to ﬁrst order the Poisson equation becomes

In this case, from the inviscid momentum equations and Eq. 10 for the dilatation it yields, after replacing t with η,
that ˆui and ˆ∆ depend only on (Mt0S). Moreover, if the initial values of the density ﬂuctuations are set to zero, S ˆρ
will also be a function of (Mt0 S), wavenumber, and η only.

As a result, for the initializations usually used in the DNS of homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow, the inviscid
linearized theory predicts the existence of only one compressibility parameter, (Mt0 S), for the properly scaled variables.
However, the addition of either the nonlinear or the viscous terms prevents the governing equations to be written
in terms of only one compressibility parameter. Therefore, for moderate values of S or Reynolds number, two
independent compressibility parameters can be deﬁned. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Simone et al. ,17 changes in
Md0 at constant Mt0 are more important to the growth of turbulent kinetic energy than changes in Mt0 at constant
Md0.

III. NUMERICAL SOLUTION PROCEDURE

A. DNS methodology

Equations (1)-(3) are solved using the Fourier pseudo-spectral method with Rogallo’s remeshing technique.21 Details
can be found in Livescu et al. 19 All simulations are performed within a box containing 2563 points. The computational
domain is twice as long in the stream-wise direction as in the cross-stream and span-wise directions so that β1 = 0.5,
β2 = 1.0 and β3 = 1.0. The initial velocity is a random solenoidal ﬁeld with unity r.m.s. and the spectrum given by
E(k) = k4/k5
0v) with k0v = 10. The initial pressure ﬂuctuations are evaluated from a Poisson equation,
the initial density ﬁeld is uniform, and the initial value of the mean pressure is calculated from the mean equation
of state. The numerical method, mesh size and initial conditions for pressure and velocity ﬁelds are the same for the
incompressible case.

Several cases, 1 to 5, are considered at diﬀerent values of the mean shear rate. For each case two simulations,
one compressible and one incompressible, are performed. Table I presents the relevant information for each of the
cases considered. The initial nondimensional shear rate is deﬁned as S∗0 = 2KS/ǫ. For the compressible cases,
the distortion Mach number Md0 is also listed. Cases 1 to 5 have the initial value of the Taylor Reynolds number
100 at the end of the simulations. Additionally, one more case (case 6) is
Reλ0 = 21 and it increases to Reλ ∼
considered with Reλ0 = 50, and all the other parameters as those of case 2. In the next sections, the compressible
simulations corresponding to cases 1 to 6 are labeled C1 to C6, and the incompressible cases are labeled I1 to I6.
All simulations were monitored to ensure that the integral scales remain small compared to the box size and the
Kolmogorov microscale is larger than the grid size. The compressible runs were also repeated with initial turbulent
Mach numbers ranging from Mt0 = 0.1 to Mt0 = 0.6 and all the results presented in the next sections remained
qualitatively unchanged.

Based on the magnitude of the shear rate, a simple scaling argument can be used to characterize the relative
importance of the nonlinear term in the momentum equations compared to the linear term arising from the presence of
1/8
the nonzero mean velocity gradient. Thus, as shown in Ref. 24, the nonlinear term is negligible when S∗1 /Reλ1 ≫
< u2
and dominates when S∗1 /Reλ1 ≪
1 >.
Figure 1 shows the time evolution of S∗1 /Reλ1 for the compressible cases considered. The results obtained for the
incompressible cases are close. The initial range of variation covers the region in which both the linear and nonlinear
terms in the momentum equations are important, with case C1, with lowest shear, for which the nonlinear eﬀects
dominate and case C5, with highest shear, for which the linear term becomes more important. After a development
time the results obtained for the cases with diﬀerent values of the mean shear rate become close, while retaining the
dependence on the initial Reynolds number. For all cases, the late time values of S∗1 /Reλ1 are in the region where
the nonlinear eﬀects dominate, based on the scaling arguments given in Ref. 24.

where j = 1, 5. The system 22-26 is transformed into spherical coordinates by setting k′1 = k′ cos α, k′2 = k′ sin α sin φ,
and k′3 = k′ sin α cos φ. Cases with (101
204) grid points for the coordinates (k′, α, φ) are considered. The
discretization is nonuniform, allowing for more grid points near the line α = φ = π/2. This is necessary, as explained
in the next section, in order to correctly capture a local peak of some of the unknowns, which gives an important
contribution to their integral over the wavenumber space. A fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme is employed for the
time advancement. The equations are also solved for the incompressible case (which is recovered by letting ˆf3 = 0).
It should be noted that the system 22-26 is independent of the initial spectra, so that it is solved only once for a
particular set of parameters. Furthermore, when integrating over the wavenumber space only the initial power spectra
are required, and not the phase information.

The linearized Eqs. (22)-(26) are solved for diﬀerent values of S∗0 ranging from 7.24 to 362. For all compressible
cases Mt0 = 0.3, so that the range in S∗0 corresponds to 2.2 < Md0 < 109. This range extends from a low shear
case in which the nonlinear eﬀects in the corresponding DNS case are important to cases with very high shear. The
initial velocity power spectrum is the same as in the DNS simulations described earlier. For the compressible case,
for each value of (Mt0 S) four types of initial conditions, labeled L1 to L4, are considered (Table II). For cases L1 and
L3 the pressure ﬂuctuations are initialized from a Poisson equation, while for cases with L2 initial conditions they
are set to zero. The initial velocity ﬁeld is solenoidal for cases L1 and L2 while χ0 = Kd0/K0 = 0.1 for cases L3
and L4, where Kd0 is the initial dilatational kinetic energy. For cases with L4 initial conditions the strong form of
the acoustic equilibrium is considered,17 so that there is an equipartition of energy between the potential and kinetic
energies of the dilatational component at each wavenumber. Therefore the initial pressure power spectrum is given
by Ep(k′) =
|t=0 < ρ0 > Ed(k′), where Ed is the initial power spectrum of the dilatational velocity.
For each case, both the inviscid and viscous equations are solved. The types of initial conditions considered are not
exhaustive for the initial conditions used in DNS of compressible turbulence (e.g. see Refs.25,26 for decaying isotropic
turbulence). However, they were chosen such that the role of a nonzero initial dilatational ﬁeld can be isolated. In
the next sections, the numerical solutions of the RDT equations are compared with the DNS results and with the
analytical predictions.

This case corresponds to values of the distortion Mach number approaching inﬁnity. After integrating Eq. (12), a
quadratic dependence on η is obtained. However, when the initial conditions (13)-(15) simpliﬁed for large (Mt0S) are
|η=0. Since the pressure mode is multiplied by the factor 1/(Mt0S) in the
applied, the solution is obtained as ˆp = ˆp
transport equations for the velocity modes, it can be dropped from these equations. Therefore the equations for the
velocity modes become:

ˆu1,η =

ˆu2,η = 0,

ˆu3,η = 0

(27)

with the solutions ˆu1 = ˆu2|η=0η + ˆu1|η=0, ˆu2 = ˆu2|η=0, and ˆu3 = ˆu3|η=0. After integrating over the wavenumber
space, it is obtained that the kinetic energy in x1 direction increases quadratically, while it remains constant in the
other two directions. This case corresponds to the “pressure-released” limit discussed by Cambon et al. 27 and Simone
et al. 17.

Therefore a signiﬁcant contribution to the integral of the pressure spectrum over the wavenumber space comes from
a narrow region near k′1 = 0 which decreases in size as η increases. Following Rogers,14 the asymptotic behavior can
be found by dividing the domain into two regions, an inner region located around ηk′1 = O(1) (which corresponds
to α = π/2) and an outer region consisting of the rest of the domain covered by 0
2π. In
α
the inner region, around α = π/2 and φ = π/2, Φp(k′)k′
2 sin α has a peak. The magnitude of the peak and the
extent in α and φ over which it occurs can be found by writing α = π/2
ǫφ and expanding the
ǫα and φ = π/2

sin and cos functions in the expression for the pressure spectrum. It yields that Φp(k′)k′
2 sin α is of order η4 for
O(1/η2) and ǫφ = O(1/η), so that the peak occurs over a region of extent O(1/η2) in α and O(1/η) in
ǫα = 1/η
φ. This indicates a linear increase for the pressure variance. The correct behavior can be obtained by combining the
results from the inner and outer regions. The result obtained remains < p′

results of the numerical integration.

(Mt0 S)2 ﬁnite

In this case the transport equation for the pressure mode (Eq. 12) remains third order, and does not have an easily
derived analytical solution. However, some limiting cases can be found. First, it should be observed that ˆp approaches
so that only ﬁnite values of k′i are of interest. Then for small values of η the equation reduces to an
zero as k′i → ∞
equation with constant coeﬃcients which can be easily solved. However, since the roots of the characteristic polynomial
are dependent on the parameter (Mt0S), the analytical computations involving the integration of the solution over
the wavenumber space are cumbersome. Nevertheless, the solution was veriﬁed numerically and it agrees reasonably
well with the full numerical solution of the RDT equations.

As η

→ ∞

, unlike in the incompressible case, the behavior of the Fourier modes in the outer region (k′1η >> 1)
is very important for the integration over the wavenumber space. It is shown above that for the incompressible case
the contribution from the inner region yields a linear increase for the pressure variance. However, as the parameter
(Mt0 S)2 decreases, the peak of the pressure mode occurring in the inner region decreases its magnitude (Fig. 2) and
the contribution from this region to the pressure variance yields a less than linear increase in time. This contribution
to the pressure variance is negligible at long times since it is shown below that the contribution from the outer region
leads to a linear increase in the pressure variance.

V. COMPARISON WITH DNS

where the constants cij depend on (Mt0 S) and the wavenumber.

Although the early time response of the ﬂow to the presence of the shear is correctly captured by the linearized
equations, the long time evolution of the ﬂow can become very diﬀerent than that obtained from the full nonlinear
equations. However, there are quantities which follow the RDT predictions even at long times. This is the case with
various correlation coeﬃcients (e.g. the Reynolds stress correlation coeﬃcient) in the incompressible case.14 For the
compressible case, the eﬀect of compressibility on the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy is correctly captured
by the linearized equations.17

It is shown below that other characteristics of the dilatational ﬁeld are captured by the linearized equations. In
particular, it is shown that the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the shear and the
anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation rate tensor are captured by the RDT equations.
Furthermore, DNS results show that the transverse even order derivative moments of the velocity ﬁeld in both
compressible and incompressible cases are anisotropic and the anisotropy increases with the order of the moment.
Thus, the anisotropy of the higher order moments may persist at large values of the Reynolds number, in contrast
with the local isotropy principle.29 Moreover, the DNS results indicate that the odd order normalized x2 derivative
moments of u1 approach a constant diﬀerent than zero at large times. These results can also be explained using the
RDT solutions.

A. Dilatational kinetic energy and dissipation anisotropy

By comparing formulas 51-53 with solutions obtained for the velocity modes, it can be seen that at long times
ˆu3s. It is obtained that most of the dilatational kinetic energy resides in the direction
ˆu1 ≈
of the mean velocity gradient, consistent with the numerical solution of the linearized Eqs. (6)-(8) (Fig. 5a). The
addition of the viscous terms decreases the dominance of K2d component compared to the other two components,

ˆu2d, and ˆu3 ≈

ˆu1s, ˆu2 ≈

11

as can be seen in Fig. 5(b). A further decrease of the relative magnitude of K2d is obtained in the fully nonlinear
case (Fig. 5c). Nevertheless, as Fig. 5(c) shows, the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the mean velocity
gradient obtained in DNS is larger than in the other two directions, in agreement with the previous studies.18,19,30
The above analysis indicates that the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational kinetic energy in the direction of the mean
shear can be explained by linear eﬀects.

Previous numerical simulations of compressible homogeneous shear ﬂow18,19,20 indicate that the dilatational dissi-
pation rate tensor behaves very diﬀerently than its solenoidal counterpart. Thus, the dilatational dissipation rate is
ampliﬁed in the direction of the mean shear. This behavior was previously attributed to the formation of shocklets
aligned preferentially in x2 direction. Livescu and Madnia20 performed simulations at diﬀerent values of the turbulent
Mach number and obtained no signiﬁcant decrease in the anisotropy of the dilatational dissipation rate tensor in low
turbulent Mach number simulations. Therefore, the ampliﬁcation of the dilatational dissipation rate in the direction
of the mean shear is not associated with the presence of shocklets. This conclusion is also obtained in Ref. 31. Figure
6 shows that ǫ22d becomes more important compared to ǫ11d and ǫ33d as Mt0S, which is proportional to the distortion
Mach number, increases. After multiplying the solutions for the dilatational velocity modes (Eqs. 51-53) by iki and
∂u2
performing the integration over the wavenumber space, it can be seen that in the RDT limit <
∂x2 > becomes
∂u3
∂x3 >. Numerical solutions of the RDT equations in both inviscid and
much larger than <
viscous cases conﬁrm this result. Therefore, the anisotropy of the normal components of the dilatational dissipation
rate tensor can be associated with a linear mechanism.

B. Higher order derivative moments

In the outer region k2 increases continuously, while it is very small in the inner region (where k′1η

k′2). Using the
solutions provided in the previous section for the solenoidal and dilatational components of the velocities, it can be
shown that after the multiplication by k2, the contribution from the outer region becomes dominant at long times.
Therefore, the x2 derivatives of the velocity components become much larger than the derivatives in the other two
directions. As a result, all the even order derivative statistics involving x2 derivatives become ampliﬁed and this eﬀect
is more pronounced for higher order statistics. Figure 7 compares moments of the transverse derivatives,
where j = 2, 3 and n = 2, 4 and 6, of the dilatational velocity in x1 direction. It can be seen that, as the distortion
E
Mach number increases and the RDT limit is approached, the moments containing x2 derivatives become much larger
than the corresponding x3 derivative statistics. Moreover, in agreement with the RDT predictions, this anisotropy is
strongly ampliﬁed for higher order moments. This again suggests that the small scale anisotropy of the dilatational
motions found in the DNS results is produced by a linear mechanism. On the other hand, the results presented show
that the higher order transverse moments are increasingly more anisotropic as the order of the moment increases.
Thus, even if the anisotropy decreases with Reynolds number, some degree of anisotropy will persist for higher order
transverse derivative moments at large values of the Reynolds number.

Although the inner region has a signiﬁcant contribution to the one-point statistics of the solenoidal velocity com-
ponents in x1 and x3 directions, this contribution becomes negligible for the statistics involving x2 derivatives. As
explained above, in the outer region ˆu1s and ˆu3s become constant at large times so that after the multiplication
with k2 they increase linearly. Therefore, the outer region yields a quadratic increase in time for < ∂u1s
∂u1s
∂x2 > and
∂x2
∂u3s
< ∂u3s
∂x2 >. The contribution from the inner region does not increase after the multiplication with k2 and the
∂x2
inner region yields a less than quadratic increase for the above quantities. Similar results are obtained for higher
order moments. Thus, similar to the dilatational velocities, in the RDT limit the even order transverse derivatives of
the solenoidal velocities in x1 and x3 directions are anisotropic and become even more anisotropic as the order of the
statistics increases. Figure 8 conﬁrms that this eﬀect is also present in the DNS results for the derivative moments of
u1s and similar results are obtained for the derivative moments of u3s.

A comparison between Figs. 7 and 8 indicates that the transverse solenoidal derivative moments are less anisotropic
than their dilatational counterparts. Again, it can be shown that this is also in agreement with the RDT predictions.
Thus, since ˆu1s becomes constant in the outer region, it yields that k2 ˆu1s ∼
derivative retains inﬂuence mostly from the inner region and

η. On the other hand ˆu1d retains inﬂuence

obtained for higher order statistics. Therefore, in the RDT limit, the even order transverse derivatives of the u1d

are more anisotropic than their solenoidal counterparts for large but ﬁnite values of η (Fig. 9). Similar results are
obtained for the velocity in x3 direction.

Using the same analysis as above, it can be shown that the odd order moments of the x2 derivatives of u1s also

have most of the contributions from the outer regions. Thus, after the multiplication with kn

ˆu1s becomes constant at large times, it yields that the moment of order n increases in time as ηn, and, therefore,

than zero at large times. As Fig. 10 shows, this prediction is in general agreement with the DNS data. The same
analysis can not be used for u3s. It was shown that in the outer region ˆu3s approaches its initial value. Therefore,
after multiplication by kn
ηk′1)n the odd order moments of the x2 derivative, would approach values proportional
to those of the initial odd order moments of the x1 derivative. However, for isotropic initial conditions, these values
are zero. This is consistent with the overall symmetry of the problem, which requires that the odd order x1 and x2
moments of the u3 velocity remain zero at all times.

For the incompressible case, complete analytical solutions are known for the velocity ﬁeld.12,14 Although most of
the contributions to the velocity variances in x1 and x3 directions come from the inner region, it is easy to show
that the statistics involving x2 derivatives have contributions mostly from the outer region, where at large times
ηk′1. Moreover, the behavior of the velocity modes in the outer region is similar to that obtained above for
k2 ≈ −
the solenoidal velocity modes. Consequently, in the RDT limit the transverse even order moments of the velocity
derivatives are anisotropic, and the anisotropy increases for higher order moments. Similar to the solenoidal moments
for the compressible case and consistent with the RDT predictions, the incompressible DNS results presented in Fig.
11 show an increase in the anisotropy for higher order transverse derivatives moments of u1. Similar results are
obtained for u3. Therefore, it is expected that for higher order moments the anisotropy will persist at large Reynolds
numbers.

In addition, similar to the solenoidal velocity for the compressible case, the RDT solutions for the incompressible
case predict that the odd order normalized x2 derivative moments of u1 and u3 should approach a constant diﬀerent
than zero at large times. The DNS results are similar to those shown in Fig. 10 for the solenoidal velocity ﬁeld in
the compressible case and support the RDT prediction. As explained above, as the Reynolds number increases the
small scales become more energetic and the ﬂow departs from the RDT limit (see also Fig. 1). For very large values
of the Reynolds number, the postulate of local isotropy requires that the odd order transverse derivative moments
should approach zero. However, since the linear eﬀects lead to a ηn increase in time for the x2 derivative moments,
for higher order moments the linear contribution may become dominant at long times even at large values of the
Reynolds number. Therefore, the higher order normalized transverse x2 derivative moments could have persistent
non-zero values at large Reynolds numbers. The present numerical simulations do not have a large enough Reynolds
number to examine this hypothesis, however the analysis presented is consistent with the experimental results of Shen
and Warhaft.1 At high Reynolds numbers, the experimental results indicate that lower odd order moments of ∂u1
∂x2
become small as the Reynolds number increases. However, this tendency is not observed for higher order moments.
As suggested by Schumacher et al. ,24 the small-scale intermittency might play a role on the observed behavior of the
higher order moments. Nevertheless, the persistent anisotropy of the higher odd order normalized derivative moments
found experimentally is in agreement with the present linear analysis.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The structure of homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow is studied using data generated by DNS and an RDT analysis
for both compressible and incompressible cases. For the compressible case, simulations with diﬀerent initial values
of the distortion Mach number, Md, and Reynolds number are considered. Incompressible simulations are performed
with the same initial pressure and velocity ﬁelds as for the compressible simulations.

Previous DNS studies18,19,20 indicate that there is an anisotropy among the dilatational kinetic energy components.
Moreover, the results of Livescu et al. 19 suggest that the energy transfer through the nonlinear terms in the transport
equations for Kid is not responsible for this behavior. In order to verify that the anisotropy of the dilatational kinetic
energy components can be explained by linear eﬀects, the linearized equations are considered. The RDT equations
are solved numerically, for both the inviscid and viscous cases, for a large range of distortion Mach numbers and
diﬀerent types of initial conditions. The RDT results are consistent with the DNS ﬁndings for the development of the
dilatational ﬁeld.

Furthermore, for large times, analytical solutions are found for the inviscid linearized equations in Fourier space.
The integration of these solutions over the wavenumber space can predict the behavior of various statistics in real

13

space. It is shown that the solutions for the pressure, dilatation and dilatational velocities Fourier modes for ﬁnite
values of k′1 oscillate in time and the amplitudes of oscillations increase. The analytical relations indicate that the
magnitude of the Fourier mode of the dilatational velocity in the direction of the mean shear becomes much larger
than in the other two directions.

It is known that for incompressible homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow in the RDT limit most of the contributions
to the velocity variances come from a narrow region in the wavenumber space situated near k′1 = 0.14 A similar trend
is found for the pressure variance. However, it is shown that the contribution from this region to the statistics of the
velocity ﬁeld involving x2 derivatives for both compressible and incompressible cases and to all the statistics of the
dilatational velocities becomes negligible at long times. For ﬁnite values of k′1, the wave number in the direction of
the mean shear increases continuously in time. Therefore, the derivatives in this direction become much larger than
in the other two directions. As a result, in the RDT limit the even order transverse derivative moments of both the
dilatational and solenoidal velocity ﬁelds for the compressible case and the even order transverse derivative moments
of the velocity ﬁeld for the incompressible case are anisotropic. Moreover, the anisotropy becomes ampliﬁed for higher
order moments. The RDT analytical solutions also predict that the small dilatational scales are more anisotropic than
their solenoidal counterparts, in agreement with the DNS results. Since the x2 derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld retain
inﬂuence mostly from the region where the wavenumber in x2 direction increases in time, it is shown that in the RDT
limit the odd order normalized x2 derivative moments of u1 for the incompressible case and u1s for the compressible
case should approach a constant diﬀerent than zero at large times. This prediction is consistent with the DNS results.
As the Reynolds number increases the small scales become more energetic and for constant mean distortion the ﬂow
departs the RDT limit. Therefore, it is expected that, consistent with the postulate of local isotropy, the anisotropy
of the small scales should decrease at large values of the Reynolds number, i.e. the odd order normalized x2 derivative
moments approach zero and the even order transverse moments become isotropic. However, it is argued that, since
in the RDT limit the odd order moments increase in time as ηn, where n is the order of the moment, for higher order
moments the linear contribution may be important even at large values of the Reynolds number. Thus, the RDT
analysis suggests a persistent anisotropy of the higher odd order normalized derivative moments. In addition, since
the anisotropy of the even order transverse derivative moments increases with the order of the moment, it is expected
that persistent anisotropy levels in the transverse higher even order derivative moments will be found at large values
of the Reynolds number. Although high Reynolds number results will not be available from DNS in the near future,
they are within the reach of experiments and these predictions can be veriﬁed using experimental data.

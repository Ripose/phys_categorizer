Abstract

We give an explanation for the onset of wind-induced ﬂutter in a ﬂag. Our theory accounts

for the various physical mechanisms at work: the ﬁnite length and the small but ﬁnite bending

stiﬀness of the ﬂag, the unsteadiness of the ﬂow, the added mass eﬀect and vortex shedding from

the trailing edge. Our analysis allows us to predict a critical speed for the onset of ﬂapping as well

as the frequency of ﬂapping. We ﬁnd that in a particular limit corresponding to a low density ﬂuid

ﬂowing over a soft high density ﬂag, the ﬂapping instability is akin to a resonance between the

mode of oscillation of a rigid pivoted airfoil in a ﬂow and a hinged-free elastic ﬁlament vibrating

in its lowest mode.

The ﬂutter of a ﬂag in a gentle breeze, or the ﬂapping of a sail in a rough wind are

commonplace and familiar observations of a rich class of problems involving the interaction

of ﬂuids and structures, of wide interest and importance in science and engineering [1].

Folklore attributes this ﬂapping instability to some combination of (i) the B´enard- von

K´arm´an vortex street that is shed from the trailing edge of the ﬂag, and (ii) the ﬂapping

instability to the now classical Kelvin-Helmholtz problem of the growth of perturbations at

an interface between two inviscid ﬂuids of inﬁnite extent moving with diﬀerent velocities [2].

However a moment’s reﬂection makes one realize that neither of these is strictly correct. The

frequency of vortex shedding from a thin ﬂag (with an audible acoustic signature) is much

higher than that of the observed ﬂapping, while the initial diﬀerential velocity proﬁle across

the interface to generate the instability, the ﬁnite ﬂexibility and length of the ﬂag make

it qualitatively diﬀerent from the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. Following the advent of high

speed ﬂight, these questions were revisited in the context of aerodynamically induced wing

ﬂutter by Theodorsen [4]. While this important advance made it possible to predict the onset

of ﬂutter for rigid plates, these analyses are not directly applicable to the case of a spatially

extended elastic system such as a ﬂapping ﬂag. Recently, experiments on an elastic ﬁlament

ﬂapping in a ﬂowing soap ﬁlm [6], and of paper sheets ﬂapping in a breeze [5] have been used

to further elucidate aspects of the phenomena such as the inherent bistability of the ﬂapping

and stationary states, and a characterization of the transition curve. In addition, numerical

solutions of the inviscid hydrodynamic (Euler) equations using an integral equation approach

[8] and of the viscous (Navier-Stokes) equations [9] have shown that it is possible to simulate

the ﬂapping instability. However, the physical mechanisms underlying the instability remain

elusive. In this paper, we aim to remedy this using the seminal ideas of Theodorsen [4].

We will start by considering the dynamics of an inextensible one-dimensional elastic

ﬁlament of length L and diameter d and made of a material of density ρs and Young’s

modulus E embedded in a two dimensional parallel ﬂow of an ambient ﬂuid with a density

ρ and kinematic viscosity ν, shown schematically in Fig. 1 1. We assume that the leading

edge of the naturally straight ﬁlament is clamped at the origin with its tangent along the

x axis, and that far from the ﬁlament, the ﬂuid velocity U = Ux. Then the transverse

1 Our analysis also carries over to the case of an elastic sheet a 3-dimensional parallel ﬂow with no variations

in the direction perpendicular to the main ﬂow.

diﬀerence across the ﬁlament due to ﬂuid ﬂow. In deriving (1) we have assumed that the slope

of the ﬁlament is small so that we can neglect the eﬀect of any geometrical nonlinearities;

these become important in determining the detailed evolution of the instability but are not

relevant in understanding the onset of ﬂutter. For the case when the leading edge of the

ﬂag is clamped and the trailing edge is free, the boundary conditions associated with (1) are

[10]:

Y (t, 0) = 0, Yx(t, 0) = 0,

Yxx(t, L) = 0, Yxxx(t, L) = 0.

To close the system (1,2) we must evaluate the ﬂuid pressure ∆P by solving the equations

of motion for the ﬂuid in the presence of the moving ﬁlament. We will assume that the ﬂow

is incompressible, inviscid and irrotational. The omission of viscous eﬀects is justiﬁed if the

ﬂow and a circulatory ﬂow associated with vortex shedding, following the pioneering work

of Theodorsen [4]. This allows us to respect Kelvin’s theorem preserving the total vorticity

of the inviscid system (which is always zero) by considering a vortex sheet in the ﬂuid and

an image sheet of opposite strength that is in the ﬁlament. Both ﬂows may be described

by a velocity potential φ which itself may be decomposed into a non-circulatory potential

φnc and a circulatory potential φγ with φ = φnc + φγ. Then φ satisﬁes the Laplace equation

n2φ = 0 characterizing the two-dimensional ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld (u, v) = (φx, φy).

∇

For small deﬂections of the ﬁlament, the transverse velocity of the ﬂuid v varies slowly

along the ﬁlament. Then we may use a classical result from airfoil theory [11] for an airfoil

moving with a velocity v = Yt + UYx to deduce the non-circulatory velocity potential along

Here we note that the ﬂuid added-mass eﬀect 3 is characterized by the term proportional

Kelvin’s theorem demands that vorticity is conserved in an inviscid ﬂow of given topology.

Thus, the circulatory ﬂow associated with vortex shedding from the trailing edge requires a

vorticity distribution in the wake of the airfoil and a (bound) vorticity distribution in the

ﬁlament with strength

airfoil to conserve the total vorticity. If a point vortex shed from the trailing edge of the

τ symmetry is also broken. These two leading terms in the pressure, which could have

been written down on grounds of symmetry, correspond to a lift force proportional to ηs, and

a frictional damping proportional to ητ . By considering the detailed physical mechanisms,

we ﬁnd that the actual form of these terms is more complicated due to the inhomogeneous

dimensionless functions f (s), n(s). Thus, understanding the ﬂapping instability reduces to

a stability analysis of the trivial solution η = 0 of the system (15,2) and the determination

of a transition curve as a function of the problem parameters µ, δ.

At the onset of the oscillatory instability, Re(σ) = 0, so that σ = iω and C[γ] is given by

(16). Then (17, 2) constitutes a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for ω, ξ given the nonlinear

ω dependence of the Theodorsen function C(q) = C(ω/2δ) in (16). We solve the resulting

system numerically with the AUTO package [13], using a continuation scheme in ω starting

with a guess for the Theodorsen function C(ω/2δ) = C(0) = 1 . As we shall see later, this

limit corresponds to the quasi-steady approximation [3]. In Fig. 2 we show the calculated

transition curve; when δ > δc(µ), Re(σ) > 0 with Im(σ)

= 0, i.e. an oscillatory instability

leading to ﬂutter arises. We see that for suﬃciently large δ the ﬁlament is always unstable,

i.e. large enough ﬂuid velocities will always destabilize the elastic ﬁlament. As µ

1, the

added mass eﬀect becomes relatively more important and it is easier for the higher modes

of the ﬁlament to be excited. In Fig. 3 we show the mode shapes when µ < 1 and µ

1; as

expected the most unstable mode for µ

1 is not the fundamental mode of the ﬁlament.

We also see that the normalized amplitude of the unstable modes is maximal at the trailing

edge; this is a consequence of the inhomogeneous functions f (s), n(s) in (15) as well as the

≫

≫

clamped leading edge and a free trailing edge.

To further understand the instability, we now turn to a simpler case using the quasi-steady

approximation [3]. This supposes that the lift forces are slaved adiabatically to those on a

stationary airfoil with the given instantaneous velocity Yt+UYx, so that C = 1. By assuming

≫

7

that the Kutta condition is satisﬁed instantaneously, we over-estimate the lift forces and thus

expect to get a threshold for stability that is slightly lower than if C

= 1. To characterize

the instability in this situation, we substitute an inhomogeneous perturbation of the form

η(s, τ ) = ξ(s)eστ into (15,2) and solve the resulting eigenvalue problem to determine the

growth rate σ = σ(δ, µ). In Fig. 2, we show the stability boundary corresponding to the

quasi-steady approximation. We note that the stability boundary when C

= 1 accounting

for vortex shedding corresponds to a higher value of the scaled ﬂuid velocity δ than that

obtained using the quasi-steady approximation C = 1, and is a consequence of the quasi-

steady approximation which over-estimates the lift forces.

eﬀects as well as regions of bistability where both the ﬂapping and stationary state are stable.

modes of oscillation: (i) that of a ﬂexible ﬁlament bending with a frequency that is depen-

dent on the wavenumber and (ii) that of a rigid ﬁlament in the presence of ﬂow-aligning

aerodynamic forces. In this limiting case, we can clearly see the physical mechanisms at

work in determining the stability or instability of the ﬁlament: small ﬁlaments are very stiﬀ

in bending, but as the ﬁlament length becomes large enough for the ﬂuid pressure to excite

a resonant bending instability the ﬁlament starts to ﬂutter. Equivalently, the instability is

observed when the bending oscillation frequency become of the order of the frequency of

oscillations of a hinged rigid plate immersed in a ﬂow. To see this quantitatively, we look

for solutions to (18,2) of the form η(s, τ ) = ξ(s)eστ and compute the associated spectrum

σ(δ). In Fig. 4, we show that for δ < δc = 10.08/√µ with µ

1, the spectrum lies on

As µ

O(1), the eﬀective damping term µδCf (s)ητ becomes important, so that the

spectrum is shifted to the left, i.e. Re(σ) < 0. In this case, although the instability is not

directly related to a resonance, the physical mechanism remains the same, i.e. a competition

between the destabilizing inﬂuence of part of the ﬂuid inertia and the stabilizing inﬂuence

of elastic bending, subject to an eﬀective damping due to ﬂuid motion. This simple picture

curve obtained from a recent study on the onset of ﬂutter in paper sheets [5]. The large error

bars in the experimental data are due to the fact that there is a region of bistability wherein

both the straight and the ﬂapping sheet are stable. Our linearized theory cannot capture this

bistability without accounting for the various possible nonlinearities in the system arising

from geometry. But even without accounting for these nonlinearities, there is a systematic

discrepancy between our theory and the data which consistently show a higher value of δ

for the onset of the instability. While there are a number of possible reasons for this, we

believe that there are two likely candidates: the role of three-dimensional eﬀects and the

eﬀect of the tension in the ﬁlament induced by the Blasius boundary layer, both of which

would tend to stabilize the sheet and thus push the onset to higher values of δ.

Nevertheless our hierarchy of models starting with the relatively simple Hamiltonian

picture to the more sophisticated quasi-steady and unsteady ones have allowed us to dissect

the physical mechanisms associated with ﬂapping in a ﬁlament with a ﬁnite length and ﬁnite

bending stiﬀness and account for the added-mass eﬀect, the unsteady lift forces and vortex

shedding. They also provide a relatively simple criteria for the onset of the instability in

terms of the scaling laws (19, 20). Work currently in progress includes a detailed comparison

with a two-dimensional numerical simulation and will be reported elsewhere [15].

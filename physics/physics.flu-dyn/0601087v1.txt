Abstract

We adapt the formalism of the statistical theory of 2D turbulence in the case where the
Casimir constraints are replaced by the speciﬁcation of a prior vorticity distribution. A new
relaxation equation is obtained for the evolution of the coarse-grained vorticity. It can be used
as a thermodynamical parametrization of forced 2D turbulence (determined by the prior), or
as a numerical algorithm to construct arbitrary nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary
solutions of the 2D Euler equation.

Two-dimensional incompressible ﬂows with high Reynolds numbers are described by the

2D Euler equations

+ u · ∇ω = 0,

ω = −∆ψ,

u = −z × ∇ψ,

where ω is the vorticity and ψ the streamfunction. The 2D Euler equations are known to
develop a complicated mixing process which ultimately leads to the emergence of a large-scale
coherent structure, typically a jet or a vortex [1]. Jovian atmosphere shows a wide diversity of
structures: Jupiter’s great red spot, white ovals, brown barges,... One question of fundamental
interest is to understand and predict the structure and the stability of these equilibrium states.
To that purpose, Miller [2] and Robert & Sommeria [3] have proposed a statistical mechanics
of the 2D Euler equation. The idea is to replace the deterministic description of the ﬂow
ω(r, t) by a probabilistic description where ρ(r, σ, t) gives the density probability of ﬁnding
the vorticity level ω = σ in r at time t. The observed (coarse-grained) vorticity ﬁeld is then
expressed as ω(r, t) =
ρσdσ. To apply the statistical theory, one must ﬁrst specify the
ωdr and the energy
constraints attached to the 2D Euler equation. The circulation Γ =
ωψdr will be called robust constraints because they can be expressed in terms of
E = 1
2
the coarse-grained ﬁeld ω (the energy of the ﬂuctuations can be neglected). These integrals
can be calculated at any time from the coarse-grained ﬁeld ω(r, t) and they are conserved
f (ω)dr, or equivalently the
by the dynamics. By contrast, the Casimir invariants If =
ﬁne-grained moments of the vorticity Γf.g.
ρσndσdr, will be called fragile
constraints because they must be expressed in terms of the ﬁne-grained vorticity. Indeed, the
R
moments of the coarse-grained vorticity Γc.g
ωndr are not conserved since ωn 6= ωn (part
R
of the coarse-grained moments goes into ﬁne-grained ﬂuctuations). Therefore, the moments
Γf.g.
n>1 must be calculated from the ﬁne-grained ﬁeld ω(r, t) or from the initial conditions, i.e.
before the vorticity has mixed. Since we often do not know the initial conditions nor the
ﬁne-grained ﬁeld, the Casimir invariants often appear as “hidden constraints” [4].

The statistical theory of Miller-Robert-Sommeria is based on two assumptions: (i) it is
assumed that we know the initial conditions (or equivalently the value of all the Casimirs)
in detail (ii) it is assumed that mixing is eﬃcient and that the evolution is ergodic so that
the system will reach at equilibrium the most probable (most mixed) state. Within these
assumptions1, the statistical equilibrium state of the 2D Euler equation is obtained by maxi-
mizing the mixing entropy

multipliers, writing the ﬁrst order variations as

In the approach of Miller-Robert-Sommeria, it is assumed that the system is strictly
described by the 2D Euler equation so that the conservation of all the Casimirs has to be
taken into account. However, in geophysical situations, the ﬂows are forced and dissipated
at small scales (due to convection in the jovian atmosphere) so that the conservation of the
Casimirs is destroyed. Ellis et al.
[7] have proposed to treat these situations by ﬁxing the
conjugate variables αn>1 instead of the fragile moments Γf.g.
n>1. If we view the vorticity levels
as species of particles, this is similar to ﬁxing the chemical potentials instead of the total
number of particles in each species. Therefore, the idea is to treat the fragile constraints
canonically, whereas the robust constraints are still treated microcanonically. This point of
view has been further developed in Chavanis [8]. The relevant thermodynamical potential
is obtained from the mixing entropy (2) by using a Legendre transform with respect to the
fragile constraints [8]:

We shall assume that this function is imposed by the small-scale forcing. Assuming ergodicity,
the statistical equilibrium state is now obtained by maximizing the relative entropy Sχ at ﬁxed
energy E and circulation Γ (no other constraints). The conservation of the Casimirs has been

Some attempts have been proposed to go beyond the assumptions of the statistical theory. For example,
Chavanis & Sommeria [5] consider a strong mixing limit in which only the ﬁrst moments of the vorticity are
relevant instead of the whole set of Casimirs. On the other hand, Chavanis & Sommeria [6] introduce the
concept of maximum entropy bubbles (or restricted equilibrium states) in order to account for situations where
the evolution of the ﬂow is not ergodic in the whole available domain but only in a subdomain.

for the normalization condition

ρdσ = 1, we get the Gibbs state

This is the product of a universal Boltzmann factor by a non-universal function χ(σ) ﬁxed

It is easy to show that F ′(Φ) = −ω2(Φ) ≤ 0, where
where ˆχ(Φ) =
ω2 = ω2 − ω2 ≥ 0 is the local centered variance of the vorticity, so that F is a decreasing
function [9]. Therefore, the statistical theory predicts that the coarse-grained vorticity ω =
f (ψ) is a stationary solution of the 2D Euler equation and that the ω − ψ relationship is
a monotonic function which is increasing at negative temperatures β < 0 and decreasing
at positive temperatures β > 0 since ω′(ψ) = −βω2. We also note that the most probable
vorticity hσi(r) of the distribution (7) is given by [10]:

hσi = [(ln χ)

−1(βψ + α),

(9)

provided (ln χ)′′(hσi) < 0. This is also a stationary solution of the 2D Euler equation which
usually diﬀers from the average value ω(r) of the distribution (7) except when χ(σ) is gaussian.
We note that the ω−ψ relationship predicted by the statistical theory can take a wide diversity
of forms (non-Boltzmannian) depending on the prior χ(σ). The coarse-grained vorticity (8)
can be viewed as a sort of superstatistics as it is expressed as a superposition of Boltzmann
factors (on the ﬁne-grained scale) weighted by a non-universal function χ(σ) [4]. Furthermore,
the coarse-grained vorticity (8) maximizes a generalized entropy (in ω-space) of the form [11]:

S[ω] = −

at ﬁxed circulation and energy (robust constraints). Writing δS − βδE − αδΓ = 0 leading
to C ′(ω) = −βψ − α and ω′(ψ) = −β/C ′′(ω), and comparing with Eq. (8), we ﬁnd that C
is a convex function (C ′′ > 0) determined by the prior χ(σ) encoding the small-scale forcing
according to the relation [4]:

The preceding relations are also valid in the approach of Miller-Robert-Sommeria except that
χ(σ) is determined a posteriori from the initial conditions by relating the Lagrange multipliers
αn>1 to the Casimir constraints Γf.g.
n>1. In this case of freely evolving ﬂows, the generalized
entropy (10) depends on the initial conditions, while in the case of forced ﬂows considered
here, it is intrinsically ﬁxed by the prior vorticity distribution.

In that context,

it is possible to propose a thermodynamical parameterization of 2D
forced turbulence in the form of a relaxation equation that conserves circulation and energy
(robust constraints) and that increases the generalized entropy (10) ﬁxed by the prior χ(σ).
This equation can be obtained from a generalized Maximum Entropy Production (MEP)

where β(t) is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing the energy constraint ˙E = 0 at any time. These
equations increase the entropy (H-theorem ˙S ≥ 0) provided that D > 0, until the equilibrium
state (8) is reached. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is not determined by the MEP but it can be
obtained from a Taylor’s type argument leading to expression (13)-b [8]. This diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient, related to the strength of the ﬂuctuations, can “freeze” the relaxation in a sub-region of
space (“bubble”) and account for incomplete relaxation and lack of ergodicity [12, 13]. The re-
laxation equation (12) belongs to the class of generalized Fokker-Planck equations introduced
in Chavanis [11]. This relaxation equation conserves only the robust constraints (circulation
and energy) and increases the generalized entropy (11) ﬁxed by the prior vorticity distribution
χ(σ). It diﬀers from the relaxation equations proposed by Robert & Sommeria [14] for freely
evolving ﬂows which conserve all the constraints of the 2D Euler equation (including all the
Casimirs) and increase the mixing entropy (2).
In Eqs. (12)-(13), the speciﬁcation of the
prior χ(σ) (determined by the small-scale forcing) replaces the speciﬁcation of the Casimirs
(determined by the initial conditions). However, in both models, the robust constraints E
and Γ are treated microcanonically (i.e. they are rigorously conserved). Furthermore, in the
two-levels case ω ∈ {σ0, σ1}, the two approaches are formally equivalent and they amount to
maximizing a generalized entropy (10) similar to the Fermi-Dirac entropy at ﬁxed circulation
and energy [13]. In the viewpoint of Miller-Robert-Sommeria, this entropy describes the free
merging of a system with two levels of vorticity σ0 and σ1 while in the other viewpoint, it
describes the evolution of a forced system where the forcing has two intense peaks described
by the prior χ(σ) = χ0δ(σ − σ0) + χ1δ(σ − σ1) [8].

The relaxation equations (12)-(13) can also be used as a numerical algorithm to construct
stable stationary solutions of the 2D Euler equation. Indeed, Ellis et al. [7] have shown that
the maximization of a functional of the form (10) at ﬁxed energy and circulation determines
a stationary solution of the 2D Euler equation of the form ω = f (ψ), where f is monotonic,
which is nonlinearly dynamically stable. Since the stationary solution of Eqs. (12)-(13) max-
imizes S at ﬁxed E and Γ (by construction), this steady solution of the relaxation equations
is also a nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solution of the 2D Euler equations (1).
Thus, by changing the convex function C(ω) in Eq. (12), we can numerically construct a
wide diversity of stable solutions of the 2D Euler equations. This is a potentially interesting
procedure because it is usually diﬃcult to solve the diﬀerential equation −∆ψ = f (ψ) directly
and be sure that the solution is (nonlinearly) dynamically stable. These nonlinearly stable
steady states can be an alternative to the statistical equilibrium state in case of incomplete
relaxation, when the system has not mixed eﬃciently (non-ergodicity) so that the statistical
prediction fails. In case of incomplete relaxation we cannot predict the equilibrium state but
we can try to reproduce it a posteriori.

Finally, we have proposed in [11] to develop a phenomenological/eﬀective statistical theory
of 2D turbulence to deal with complex situations. The idea is that some types of entropic
functional S[ω] (in ω-space) may be more appropriate than others to describe a given physical
situation. For example, the enstrophy functional turns out to be relevant in certain oceanic
situations [15] and the Fermi-Dirac type entropy in jovian ﬂows [16, 9]. Certainly, other
In addition, other
functionals of the same “class” would work as well for these systems.
classes of functionals S[ω] may be relevant in other circumstances. Therefore, as a simple
and practical procedure to describe a given system, we propose to pick a functional S[ω]
in the “class of equivalence” appropriate to that system and use it in the parameterization
(12)-(13). We can thus describe the time evolution of the system on the coarse-grained scale.
This approach is not completely predictive because we need to know in advance which type
of entropy S[ω] describes best such and such situation. In practice, it must be determined
by trying and errors (e.g. by comparing with oceanic data). But once a speciﬁc entropy
has been found for a physical situation, we can work with it for diﬀerent initial conditions
speciﬁed by the robust constraints E and Γ (the eﬀect of the Casimirs is reported in the
chosen form of entropy S[ω]). The idea is that the entropy S remains the same while E and Γ
are changed. The problem is rich and non-trivial even if S has been ﬁxed because bifurcations
can occur depending on the control parameters E, Γ. This heuristic approach can be viewed
as a simple attempt to account for the inﬂuence of the Casimirs while leaving the problem
tractable. We use the fact that the Casimirs lead to non-standard (i.e. non-Boltzmannian)
ω − ψ relationships at equilibrium which are associated with non-standard forms of entropy
S[ω] in ω-space. We propose to ﬁx the S-functional depending on the situation. We do not
try to predict its form, but rather to adjust it to the situation contemplated. This is based
on the belief that some functionals S[ω] are more relevant than others for a given system.
Whether this is the case or not remains to be established. All the ideas presented here can
be generalized to the case of quasi-geostrophic or shallow-water equations [9].

Abstract

We consider the viscous motion of a thin, axisymmetric column of
ﬂuid with a free surface. A one-dimensional equation of motion for the
velocity and the radius is derived from the Navier-Stokes equation. We
compare with recent experiments on the breakup of a liquid jet and
on the bifurcation of a drop suspended from an oriﬁce. The equations
form singularities as the ﬂuid neck is pinching oﬀ. The nature of the
singularities is investigated in detail.

1 Introduction

A problem fundamental to the study of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equa-
tions (PDE’s) is the nature of their singularities. Perhaps the most famous
(and unsolved) problem is the suspected blow-up of the derivatives of the
velocity ﬁeld in the three-dimensional Euler equation [17]. Shocks, i.e., dis-
continuities in the velocity, are the type of singularities displayed by the
one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation [24].

Still a diﬀerent type of singularity has to be expected from three-dimensional

free surface ﬂow, which we will consider here. A similar study of a two-
dimensional ﬂow has been conducted recently [7]. Surface tension will tend
to make the surface as small as possible by reducing the radius. The clas-
sical stability analysis of an inﬁnite cylinder of ﬂuid by Rayleigh [22] shows
that the radius does not decrease uniformly: Due to the constraint of mass
conservation the fastest growing mode is the one with wavelength λ
9r0,
where r0 is the radius of the cylinder. Consequently, the ﬂuid cylinder will
decay into drops of roughly that size.

≈

Once the radius becomes zero locally, i.e. the original column of ﬂuid
separates, the description in terms of a radius function breaks down. Hence
the equations must develop a singularity at that point. Although linear sta-
bility analysis gives a reasonable estimate of the size of the droplets formed,
it completely fails to predict the shape of the surface once an appreciable
deformation of the original cylinder is reached [6]. For example it does not
explain the fact that the cylinder does not break up uniformly. Rather,
regular size drops are, under most circumstances, followed by much smaller
“satellite drops”. Even higher order perturbation theory [6, 5] gives only a
qualitative prediction of the unequal drop sizes, but is not able to describe
the shape of the ﬂuid anywhere close to pinch-oﬀ. This is not very surprising,
because the characteristic time of the linear instability is close to the time
distance from the singularity, where expansions in the radius and the velocity
are bound to break down.

Therefore a complete treatment of the nonlinearities is needed. The full
Navier-Stokes equation with free boundary conditions is extremely compli-
cated, for both analytical and numerical studies. The only simulations of
axisymmetric drops we are aware of were restricted to irrotational, inviscid
ﬂow [1]. But even with this restriction simulations close to the singularity
become extremely costly, since the neck region requires high resolution. A

2

reduction of the problem to one dimension will give huge savings in computer
time, making closeups of the singularity possible.

There already exist some one-dimensional equations for axisymmetric free
surface ﬂow [15, 2]. Lee [15] only considers the inviscid case. Bogy’s equations
[2] allow for dissipation but are very complicated in structure and do not have
a clear connection with the original Navier-Stokes equation. We will therefore
derive a set of one-dimensional equations by expanding the radial variable in
a Taylor series and keeping only the lowest order terms of the Navier-Stokes
equation. Several invariances and conservation laws of the Navier-Stokes
equation are preserved. This will be the subject of the second section, along
with a linear stability analysis.

Integrating the equations near the singularity proves to be very diﬃcult,
since the problem becomes very stiﬀ due to the large range of length scales
in the problem. We develop a fully implicit centered diﬀerence method. This
scheme is then modiﬁed to treat the convection term vvz by an upwinding
technique which ensures negative deﬁniteness of the numerical dissipation.
The numerical scheme is detailed in section three.

There is a fair amount of work applying one-dimensional equations to
the breakup of jets [15, 2], liquid bridges [18] or hanging drops [9]. There
is also work in this spirit on ﬁlms lining a cylindrical tube [11]. Yet a de-
tailed comparison between experiments and one-dimensional models within
the nonlinear regime is missing. Therefore, we try to compare experimental
drop proﬁles with simulations close to the breakup point. This is found in
section four for two recent experiments.

The ﬁrst experiment [5] examines the decay of a free jet of water, the
second observes how a hanging drop detaches after it is adiabatically ﬁlled
out of an oriﬁce [21]. We also produce an example with a high viscosity
ﬂuid. Simulations and experiments agree very well, giving ample support
to the idea that droplet breakup can be well described by one-dimensional
equations.

In the next section we take a closer look at the pinch region. We discuss
a similarity theory for the nonviscous case and explain its failure. All viscous
solutions are determined by universal scaling functions close to the pinch
point. The concluding section brieﬂy discusses the approximation used in
relation to other types of approximations, its higher order versions, and the
full Navier-Stokes or Euler equations. Finally, we indicate directions of future
research.

2 The equations of motion

We start from the Navier-Stokes equation for an axisymmetric column of ﬂuid
with kinematic viscosity ν, density ρ, and surface tension γ. In cylindrical
coordinates it reads [14]

∂rp/ρ + ν(∂2

(2)

where vz is the velocity along the axis, vr the velocity in the radial direc-
tion, and p the pressure. The acceleration of gravity g points in negative
z-direction. The continuity equation reads

∂rvr + ∂zvz + vr/r = 0.

The equations (2) and (3) hold for 0
forces gives

r < h(z, t). The balance of normal

n σ n = γ(1/R1 + 1/R2),

where σ is the stress tensor, n the outward normal, and R1 and R2 are the
principal radii of curvature. The tangential force balance is

Since we are going to look at thin columns of ﬂuid relative to their elon-
gation, we expand in a Taylor series with respect to r. By symmetry we
get

to lowest order in r. In the case of (2) this gives

The set of equations (17) – (20) is going to concern us for the rest of
this paper. We reiterate that the physical velocity ﬁeld (9), (10) described
by (17), (18) has both radial and longitudinal components with a nontrivial
r-dependence. The physical pressure (11) also carries contributions from the
shear stress. This should be born in mind when we refer to v and p in (17),
(18) as “velocity” and “pressure”.

Since
is negative deﬁnite, it follows that, without external driving (bound-

tial energy for the full equations is precisely (24) , so that the exact surfaces of
static equilibrium are also equilibrium surfaces of the model: they are states
which minimize Epot [14]. Famous examples are the equilibrium shapes of
pendant drops [19]. This was the reason for keeping lower order terms in the
expression for p: in a consistent expansion by orders of r the expression for
p simply would have been

p = γ(1/h

resulting in a diﬀerent form of the potential energy. We also note that
is
not negative deﬁnite for the viscous term as cited by Cram [9]. His term νvzz
may feed energy into the ﬂuid, which we found to prevent the system from
reaching an equilibrium state.

Although of limited applicability in practice, it is instructive to repeat the
stability analysis for a ﬂuid cylinder in the case of our model. Assume a cylin-
der of radius r0 receives a sinusoidal perturbation of wavelength λ = 2π/k;
then

r(z, t) = r0[1 + ε(t)cos(kz)],
v(z, t) = ε(t)v0sin(kz).

For ν = 0, the most unstable wavelength is therefore λmax = 8.89 r0 instead
of the exact value of 9.01 r0 [4]. In the limit of very high viscosity the inﬁnite
wavelength perturbation becomes the most unstable one.

3 Numerical procedure

The numerical approximations were computed using a rather simple ﬁnite
diﬀerence scheme. The spatial mesh is highly nonuniform, graded mesh; its
reﬁnement is based on the behavior of the computed solution. The time-
integration method is an adaptive fully implicit θ-weighted scheme.

Diﬀerence analogs of the v-equation, (17), were written corresponding
to each point zi+ 1
and the diﬀerence analogs of the h-equation, (18), were
written for each zi. The time derivative term was approximated by dvi/

or dhi/
zi in terms of h at zi−1, zi, and zi+1, using centered diﬀerences for the hz
term and a second diﬀerence for hzz. (Near the bottom of a pendant drop

△

this was changed; see the remarks just after (34).) This deﬁnes p at each
time level in terms of h at that level.

In setting up the diﬀerence equations that mimic (17) and (18) the spatial
terms (everything except the time derivative terms) are evaluated using a
weighted average of the current value and the yet-to-be-computed value.
These “mid-step” values can be written as vi + θdvi and hi + θdhi. With
θ = 0.5 this gives a second order correct in time diﬀerence equation, but we
used θ slightly larger than 0.5 (typically θ = 0.55). Using θ close to one half
gives a small ﬁrst order truncation term (say 10% of the ﬁrst-order backward
diﬀerence equation). Taking θ > 0.5 gives smoother discrete solutions than
θ = 0.5.

where NV T is the numerical viscosity term that “upwinds” this nonlinear
convective term. The NV T is structured so that it is an energy dissipation
term of small size; the usual technique of simply skewing the diﬀerence equa-
tion in the direction that the ﬂuid is coming from does not assure such a
property. The NV T term that we use is a diﬀerence analog of

In solving the nonlinear diﬀerence equations we use Newton’s method.
Many of our simulations used only one Newton step per time step, starting
from an initial guess based on linear extrapolation from the previous two
time levels.
It is quite easy, and reasonably eﬃcient, to control the time
step in such a way that one step of Newton’s method reduces the error to
very close to rounding error. It is worthwhile pointing out that even if the
decision is made to only use one step of Newton’s method it is useful to code
it in general, since observing quadratic convergence of the iteration is a good
check on whether the linearization has been done correctly.

4 Comparison with experiment

The ﬁrst experiment we consider studies the breakup of a liquid jet [5]. Water
is pumped through a nozzle at high speed to form a liquid column virtually
unaﬀected by gravity. A periodic perturbation, whose amplitude and fre-
quency can be controlled, is applied to the jet as it leaves the nozzle, The
system is allowed to reach a steady state, in which the jet at a suﬃciently
large distance from the nozzle has completely broken up into droplets. Pho-
tographs of this stationary conﬁguration are taken.

We try to model the experiment as closely as possible, but since we can
only simulate up to the point of the ﬁrst singularity (due to limitations of
our current program) we cannot reach the stationary state. Instead, we ﬁx
h+ = h−
V , and over a period of 8 wavelengths
smoothly turn on a small sinusoidal perturbation to v−.

ℓ and v+ = v−

≪

r0

≡

Thus the parameters of the simulation are the length of the jet 2ℓ, its ini-
tial radius r0, the ﬂuid parameters γ/ρ and ν, the speed of the jet V , and the
amplitude Vp and frequency fp of the perturbation. We chose r0/2ℓ = 0.004,
so the size of the drops is very small compared with the jet length and the pre-
cise value of this ratio is immaterial. Vp was adjusted to make breakup times
conform with experiment. The remaining dimensionless parameters control-
ling the problem are λ/r0, ℓν/r0, and the Weber number β2 = ρr0V 2/γ.
Here λ = V /fp is the wavelength of the perturbation and ℓν the viscous
length (29) . Typical values for ﬂuid parameters can be found in Table 1.
The jet experiments were done with water.

For the jet, the linearized problem of Section 2 now takes place in a semi-
inﬁnite geometry, where surface perturbations are prohibited to the left of

11

the nozzle opening [13],[16]. However, for large Weber numbers (239 in the
present experiment) the growth of unstable modes is just the same as the
temporal growth of Section 2, translated into space via the jet velocity V .
Also, the parabolic velocity proﬁle of the nozzle opening has relaxed into a
plug proﬁle in the relevant region of the jet [5], so we are assuming a constant
proﬁle right from the opening.

We follow the simulation up to the ﬁrst singularity. The resulting proﬁle
is aligned with a picture of the experimental jet, to make the minima in
front of the drop which is about to detach coincide. In Figure 1 theoretical
and experimental proﬁles are compared for λ/r0 = 14.57. The case with
the smallest perturbation is shown [5]. Allowing for some blur of the pho-
tographs, the agreement in the shape of the drop about to form is quite nice.
Note that the breakup is taking place in a very asymmetric fashion (with
respect to the breakup point): On the right side the proﬁle is quite steep
forming a very much rounded drop; on the other side a ﬂat neck formed,
which will eventually coalesce into a smaller satellite drop.

An even more direct comparison is possible with an experiment investi-
gating a dripping tap [21]. As long as the drop is small, it will be suspended
stably from the oriﬁce. By slowly ﬁlling in more liquid, the drop goes through
a series of stable states, until eventually gravity overcomes surface tension
and the lower half of the drop falls. Subsequently, a thin neck forms and
the lower part of the drop detaches. The stability of the drop hanging in
equilibrium has been the subject of much study in itself [19]. The length
scale controlling this problem is the capillary length

ℓc = (γ/ρg)1/2.

(33)

For water, ℓc and ℓν, the viscous length, are separated by almost ﬁve orders of
magnitude, see Table 1. Hence there is a wide range of physical phenomena
to explore between the onset of the linear instability and the breakup of the
drop.

We will not repeat the stability analysis for our one-dimensional equations
here, but concentrate on the breakup. The only dimensionless parameters in
the problem are the ratios ℓc/r0 and ℓν/r0, where r0 is the radius of the oriﬁce.
They were made to coincide with the experimental values, the working ﬂuid
being water.

There are some technical problems involved in simulating the moving
boundary at the lower end of the drop. We avoid having to use a movable

12

grid by mapping the problem on the unit interval, z/ℓ = x
is the length of the drop which is calculated using

[0, 1] where ℓ

ℓ(t) =

Z

By deﬁnition, v(1, s) is the velocity of the lower boundary. Care must also
be taken to calculate the pressure at the endpoint where hz becomes inﬁnite.
For the values x
[0.9, 1] we calculate p by interpolating h(x) with an even
fourth-order polynomial. Then all the singularities in the mean curvature
cancel.

∈

Figure 2 shows a series of proﬁles taken at constant time intervals of
0ρ/γ)1/2. In the experiment, this would correspond to 6.6ms. Given the
0.4(r3
very small time scale it would be very costly to let ﬂuid drip as slowly as is
possible in experiments. To still let initial oscillations die out, the viscosity
is set to a very high value initially, and is then reduced to the value of water
well before the ﬁrst instability. Fluid is injected at the oriﬁce with speed
0.02 γ/(ρr
). To the proﬁles at constant time intervals we add a snapshot
of the drop as the width of the neck becomes 0.01 r0. We also superimpose
an experimental picture of the drop [21], taken at the point of breakup.

1/2
0

The very good agreement with simulations is especially impressive since
this was not to be expected from a simple one-dimensional approximation.
In particular in the lower half of the drop the assumption h
ℓ seems to
fail, but one must remember that this part of the drop is almost static in a
moving frame of reference. But the static limit of the equations is retained
exactly in the approximation. Note that although the linear instability of
the hanging drop is not investigated explicitly, it is also accurately described
by the model. Namely, it determines the total volume of the drop (upper
and lower half combined) and inﬂuences the point of breakoﬀ.

≪

Again, the breakoﬀ occurs very asymmetrically, as was already observed
in the jet decay. The asymmetry therefore does not come from the action of
gravity. This is also conﬁrmed by the estimate of Peregrine et al. [21], who
estimate that by the time the neck is formed, straining forces due to surface
tension outweigh the straining forces due to gravity.

We conclude this section by reporting on a simulation of a ﬂuid with
signiﬁcantly higher viscosity. With the radius of the oriﬁce being 0.06 cm,
we adjusted ℓc/r0 and ℓν/r0 to match the parameter values for glycerol at
25◦C, as given in Table 1. The viscosity of glycerol is about 1,000 times higher

13

than that of water, leading to a very diﬀerent type of dynamics. Figure 3
shows the neck being pulled into a long and thin thread. Its length is 40
times the radius of the oriﬁce at the point of rupture. Qualitatively, this is
consistent with linear stability analysis: for high viscosity, the most unstable
wavelength becomes large, see equation (32). On the other hand, the radius
r0 of the thread becomes very small, so (32) cannot account for its length
in any quantitative way. The origin is clearly dynamical. The break occurs
at the upper end of the thread in the simulation presented, but it may also
happen close to the drop under slightly diﬀerent conditions. Experiments
with high viscosity ﬂuids in the same geometry are in in progress [23].

5 Nature of Singularities

We now look closer at the point where the ﬂuid neck is pinching oﬀ. As

and higher derivatives of both h and v will probably become inﬁnite at the
point of rupture. This is the singularity or “blow up” we want to investigate
further.

Keller and Miksis [12] present a very interesting scaling theory for the sin-
gularity in the nonviscous case. There are two important diﬀerences between
our problem and theirs: Their Geometry is two-dimensional rather than
three-dimensional-axisymmetric, and they study the time after the breakup.
The idea of their study may be described as follows: Since h becomes very
small near the singularity and v large, the pinch region is separated in scale
from the boundaries. Therefore boundary conditions become irrelevant and
the ﬂow is determined by γ/ρ alone. If ∆t = ts −
t represents the time dis-
tance from the singularity, the only available length scale is the combination
(γ∆t2/ρ)

3 . Hence, introducing

the problem can be written in terms of the similarity variables z, h, and v
alone. Once the similarity equation is solved, the resulting proﬁle determines
the evolution of the interface for all times up to the singularity. Note that

We will see, however, that this similarity argument does not carry through
for the case of our equations, since the inviscid case appears to develop
singularities even before hmin →
0 ! For a consistent formulation up to
the point of breakup we therefore need to add at least a small amount of
viscosity. We are conﬁdent that the following conjecture, due to Constantin
[8], is true. It indicates that with viscosity the singularity does not occur
until hmin goes to zero.

2 . The viscous length is ℓν = 1.4

To investigate the problem further, we chose a cylinder of radius r0 = 0.01
and length 2 as an initial condition. At its ends z =
1 the radius is kept
ﬁxed and the velocity is set to zero. Given a slight initial disturbance in
the velocity ﬁeld, the cylinder collapses and forms a singularity after about
20(r3

0ρ/γ)
The proﬁle near the singularity comes out quite asymmetric, as observed
before. This is also true if one starts from initial data almost symmetric
around z = 0. Two almost linear pieces of diﬀerent slope are joined smoothly
by a round piece with a radius of curvature comparable to the minimum
radius, cf. Figure 4 . Hence both terms in the pressure in (17) are of the
same order of magnitude at the minimum, while the ﬁrst term dominates the
linear regime away from the minimum. This means the pressure is higher on
the shallow side of the minimum (right hand side in Figure 4), forcing ﬂuid
over to the steeper side (left hand side in Figure 4). As seen by comparing
with the velocities in Figure 4, the minimum is convected with the velocity
of the ﬂuid, so in the frame of reference of the minimum ﬂuid is expelled
on either side. At the same time this causes the left hand side to get even
steeper.

If there is no mechanism curbing this process, the slope will eventually
get inﬁnite. All our simulations, conducted with diﬀerent initial radii and

initial disturbances, show that for the inviscid equations exactly this happens
and hz goes to inﬁnity even before hmin goes to zero. Note that ℓν is still
less than 2 % of the minimum height in Figure 4, yet the inviscid equations
already would have blown up at the times shown. If ν is ﬁnite, on the other
hand, hz turns out to be uniformly bounded by a constant which gets larger
as ν decreases. Hence for ﬁnite, but arbitrarily small ν blow-up only occurs
for hmin →
From the conjecture mentioned earlier we conclude that viscous solutions,
up to some ﬁnite minimum radius h0, can be well approximated by ﬁnite
diﬀerences as long as the mesh is ﬁne enough. Intuitively, one expects that the
mesh size ∆z should be at least of the order of h0. We checked convergence
near the singularity by conducting a series of runs with increasingly ﬁne
resolution. To save on computational eﬀort, only the region around the
singularity is highly resolved, the grid getting coarser by factors of 2 towards
the outside. We plotted hmin and the maximum velocity vmax versus the time
diﬀerence from the singularity on logarithmic scales, see Figure 5 . Lengths
are shown in units of ℓν and times in units of the viscous time scale

tν = ν3ρ2/γ2

(37)

The plots agree up to the length scale of the coarser grid. We also monitored
the highest derivatives in the problem, i. e. pz and vzz . The dashed vertical
line indicates up to which point they seemed well resolved. As can be seen
in Figure 5, problems with resolution occur when hmin is of the order of
∆z, indicated by the horizontal line. Since the numerical viscosity NVT
as introduced in Section 3 is approximately equal to v∆z, convergence for
increasingly ﬁne grids also demonstrates that it does not introduce artiﬁcial
eﬀects. For the ﬁnest resolution the numerical viscosity was less than a tenth
of the physical viscosity in the center of the grid. From all this we feel
conﬁdent that the plot of our best-resolved run in Figure 5 gives a faithful
description of the original equations up to the point indicated.

Figure 5 indicates that vmax goes to inﬁnity as the singularity hmin →
0
is approached. All derivatives of the velocity as well as second or higher
derivatives of the height are found to blow up even faster. This means their
asymptotic value increases faster than a negative power of ∆z as we increase
the resolution. The maximum value of hz, however, approaches a constant as
hmin →
0. This is an important self-consistency property of our equations:

16

The solutions never approach a situation where the surface parametrization
is bound to break down.

There are some regions where hmin(t) is close to a power-law, but they
never extend over more than two decades in length scales. In vmax there is
even less an indication of power-law behavior. The decay of hmin is always
faster than the t

3 power-law predicted by (35), (36).

Considering also the proﬁles h(z) and v(z) directly, we conclude that (35),
ℓν . The reason may be that (hz)max
(36) is clearly not valid, even for hmin ≫
goes to inﬁnity long before hmin goes to zero, hence viscosity is important
even on scales much larger than ℓν. The nature of the singularity of our
inviscid equations probably is speciﬁc to the approximation. For example,
it could be that the full Euler equations, instead of overturning, produce
localized regions of high vorticity which our approximation cannot describe.
The system described so far is determined by the four parameters r0, ℓ,
γ/ρ, and ν . If it has a solution h(z, t) and v(z, t), the system with parameters
ar0, aℓ, (a3/b2)γ/ρ, (a2/b)ν will have the scaled solution

This is equivalent to saying that up to a rescaling of length and time
the solution is determined by two dimensionless ratios, r0/ℓ and ℓν/ℓ, say.
By the argument presented at the beginning of this section, one expects the
solution near the singularity to be independent of the dimensions of the initial
cylinder. Hence all solutions, for t

The

signs in (38) take care of the fact that the solutions may have

We tested (38) by conducting simulations with diﬀerent parameter values
and calculating hs and vs from them. Namely, we increased r0 by a factor

solution to change dramatically, yet on length and time scales comparable
with ℓν and tν or smaller (38) is obeyed beautifully. Figure 6 shows hs and

6 Discussion

The key to the success of the present investigation lies in the construction
of appropriate model equations to study the motion of thin columns of ﬂuid.
First, our expansion method allows to take viscous body forces as well as vis-
cous boundary conditions into account. This makes it distinct from methods
where the average velocity over the cross section is the dynamical variable,
such as in the equations for shallow water waves [20]. Precisely due to the
inclusion of boundary conditions, the viscous terms in our equations become
purely dissipative.

10) at the top of the drop are very well represented.

Second, we take the exact curvature term (17) into account. The impor-
tance of those higher order terms of the expansion for strong variations of h
was noticed before [11]. Figure 2, for example, beautifully demonstrates how
the model takes equilibrium shapes into account. Also, regions of high slope
(hz ≈
Apart from experimental test, though, we do not see how to give a pri-
ori estimates of the quality of approximation in the framework of our model
alone. A possibility is to study the next order in the expansion. Apart from
an equation of motion for h, we now have two equations for the expansion co-
eﬃcients of the velocity ﬁeld, v0(z, t) and v2(z, t). Those equations, although
readily written down, are considerably more complicated than (17), (18) and
require new numerical methods. Therefore, we consider it a study all of its
own which should be investigated separately.

Most importantly, our equations remain self-consistent right up to the
point of rupture hmin →
0. This means no other singularity occurs before
that point. This is supported by our simulations over a wide range of viscosi-
ties and by preliminary mathematical analysis [8]. Speciﬁcally, there is no
overturning of the proﬁle. The full equations of motion certainly would not
form singularities even in the case of overturning, but there does not seem to

18

be experimental evidence for this to occur before breakup. (This excludes ini-
tial or boundary conditions with strong transversal velocity gradients, which
“force” the ﬂow to overturn, but which are not realizable in our equations
in the ﬁrst place.) Hence we see no reason to doubt the applicability of our
model even for small viscosities such as in water.

However, the inviscid version of our equations clearly is at odds with ex-
perimental evidence, showing overturning on experimentally accessible time-
scales. This reﬂects the singular nature of the limit ν
0. We hope this
will shed some light on the nature of this limit in the Navier-Stokes equation
and its relation to the Euler equation.

→

We plan to develop a code with adaptable grid, which moves with the
position of the minimum and introduces new grid points when needed. This
code is expected to be much more eﬀective and to allow us to reach consider-
ably higher resolution. We hope this will allow us to explore the asymptotic
regime even more carefully.

Another expected beneﬁt of the new code is to be able to go beyond the
ﬁrst singularity by introducing a new grid point at the pinch. The equations
will then be integrated from there with new boundary conditions. This will
allow us to investigate a new range of phenomena, like formation of satellite
drops, recoiling, etc.

In conclusion, we have developed a one-dimensional equation for an ax-
isymmetric thread of ﬂuid. Computed proﬁles coincide nicely with experi-
ments. The inviscid equations are inconsistent, leading to singularities even
before the breakup into drops. All solutions with ν > 0 are described by the
universal scaling functions hs, vs suﬃciently close to the singularity.

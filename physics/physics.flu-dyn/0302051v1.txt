Abstract

This work examines the stability of three-dimensional disturbances in rotating boundary layer ﬂows,

where the axis of rotation is either parallel or anti-parallel to that of the vorticity of the ﬂow. Both

Blasius and asymptotic suction layers are studied. The ﬂows are non-parallel in that transverse

velocity is taken into account in all disturbance calculations, but the eﬀect of the transverse ﬂow

on the results is negligible. A Chebyshev collocation method is applied within a temporal stability

framework to compute eigenvalues and maximum transient ampliﬁcation factors. Anti-cyclonic

rotation is eigenvalue destabilizing, as is known from results of the related cases of free shear and

channel ﬂows, introducing a region of instability characterized by modes of weak or no streamwise

dependence. Disturbances that are three-dimensional are found to experience the greatest transient

ampliﬁcation under either cyclonic or anti-cyclonic rotation.

In all cases examined here these

optimal disturbances take the form of streamwise-oriented rolls. Ampliﬁcation factors are greater

for anti-cyclonic rotation but transient growth is likely to be overwhelmed by growth of unstable

modes in this case. Optimal disturbances in cyclonically rotating boundary layer ﬂow, where

no modal instability is found, develop high streamwise variability as the rotation strengthens.

Ampliﬁcation factors are diminished by very strong cyclonic rotation, but remain signiﬁcant.

INTRODUCTION

Sheared ﬂows are ubiquitous in nature and industry and more often than not, tend to

be turbulent. One approach to the puzzle of turbulence is to study the transition pro-

cess by which a laminar ﬂow becomes turbulent. Transition is a fundamental problem of

ﬂuid mechanics that remains incompletely understood in spite of over a hundred years of

study. To unravel the process of transition, it has become conventional to study inﬁnitesi-

mal disturbances. An eigenvalue problem can then be deﬁned by assuming the disturbances

have a modal character. Two-dimensional modes in parallel ﬂows are described by the

Orr-Sommerfeld (OS) equation (for three-dimensional disturbances, the OS equation is sup-

plemented by the Squire equation). Exponentially growing modal solutions imply instability

and were assumed to be a prerequisite for transition [1].

Boundary layer ﬂows exhibit such a modal instability, in the form of Tollmien-Schlichting

(TS) waves, above the critical Reynolds number Rec ≈
to minimize the inﬂuence of free stream turbulence (FST) clearly show the growth of TS

520. Experiments carefully prepared

modes above Rec. In other laboratory cases, most notably with high levels of FST, boundary

layer ﬂows are found to become turbulent at smaller Reynolds numbers, exhibiting features

during transition that do not resemble TS modes [2],[3].

It was therefore believed that

some mechanism operating in boundary layer ﬂows allowed turbulence to occur in a way

that bypassed the traditional path involving the exponential growth of modes [4]. One such

mechanism that has been proposed is transient ampliﬁcation, a growth process possible in

shear ﬂows that was ﬁrst described by Orr [5] and later elaborated on by Ellingson and

Palm [6], Landahl [7] and others [8],[9],[10], [11], [12]; some recent reviews are also available

[13],[14], [15].

Transient ampliﬁcation is a consequence on the fact that the linear operator for distur-

bances in shear ﬂow is not self adjoint (its eigenfunctions are not orthogonal); for this reason

transient growth is a generic property of shear ﬂows. Calculation of transient ampliﬁcation

factors can proceed in the form of initial boundary value problem of linear stability theory.

A problem’s linear operator is used, along with a suitable energy norm, to calculate an

ampliﬁcation factor G(t) of arbitrary inﬁnitesimal initial conditions. In eigenvalue stable

problems G

0 as t

. Still, G(t) can reach relatively large maximum values at in-

→

→ ∞

termediate times – large enough, it has been advanced, to induce eigenvalue instability or

2

nonlinear instability in the ﬂow.

Another feature of transient growth in shear ﬂows is that the greatest ampliﬁcation is

typically achieved by three-dimensional disturbances (in contrast to eigenvalue instability

where Squire’s theorem ensures that the most unstable modes are two-dimensional).

In recent years it has become increasingly clear that transiently ampliﬁed disturbances

may be a critical ingredient in the transition to turbulence of a variety of sheared ﬂows,

including boundary layers. It is noteworthy that both numerical and laboratory observa-

tions of turbulence and transition exhibit features strongly resembling the most ampliﬁed

transient disturbances (also known optimal perturbations [10]). There is not yet a complete

theory oﬀering linear and nonlinear self-sustaining processes that explain transition in terms

of transient growth. But some approximate models have been advanced ([16]) and direct

numerical simulations (DNS) have revealed the explicit connection between transiently am-

pliﬁed disturbances and universal features of turbulent transition, such as streamwise streaks

[17].

Streamwise streaks are known to result from the “lift-up” eﬀect on the mean ﬂow of

the presence of streamwise-aligned vortices. Streamwise vortices, aside from being typical

optimal perturbations in ordinary shear, are also commonly found in shear ﬂows involving

curvature (e.g., G¨ortler vortices) and in shear ﬂows subject to rotation [24],[19].

Frame rotation normal to the ﬂow plane (see Fig. 1) is important because of its presence

in many geophysical and astrophysical ﬂows, but there are also technological applications

involving rotating machinery [26]. Astrophysical examples include the solar tachocline and

accretion disk ﬂow at the disk-star boundary. Geophysical instances of vertical boundary

layers occur in oceanic ﬂows and in the circulation around solid planetary cores. Related lab-

oratory ﬂows in rotating cylinders [25] also show sidewall boundary layers under diﬀerential

driving and during spin-up and spin-down.

Free shear ﬂows subject to rotation have been studied [18],[19],[21] previously. Cyclonic

rotation and strong anti-cyclonic rotation are found to stabilize modal solutions; weak anti-

cyclonic rotation results in unstable modes in the form of streamwise vortices. Sheared ﬂows

in channels subject to rotation have also been studied [24],[23],[22] and found to exhibit

similar stability properties as free shear ﬂows.

Boundary layer ﬂows subject to rotation have been less studied, even though the boundary

layer over a ﬂat plate continues to be an essential prototypical ﬂow in the study of stability,

3

transition and turbulence. However, in one limited study [20] it was found the the Blasius

boundary layer is stabilized by cyclonic rotation and that anti-cyclonic rotation could be

destabilizing. Transient ampliﬁcation has been calculated for rotating channel ﬂows [23] but

not for rotating boundary layer ﬂows.

The main objective of this study is the calculation of the optimally ampliﬁed transient

disturbances and eigenvalue spectra of boundary layer ﬂows subject to rotation. Also, the

physical characteristics of the optimal disturbances and the eigenvalue unstable modes are

found and compared.

In this work, non-parallel eﬀects of the base ﬂow are retained by

not neglecting the transverse (cross-stream) velocity components of the ﬂows. The focus is

primarily on Blasius boundary layer ﬂow, although some attention is paid to the asymptotic

suction proﬁle; both these ﬂows have known transverse velocity components.

The standard Blasius solution is unsteady and includes the transverse ﬂow in the y di-

rection, VB(y), describing the instantaneous boundary layer expansion. Asymptotic suction

exact steady solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Uniform suction (whether present

inherently, as in AS ﬂow or imposed upon Blasius ﬂow) is known to strongly stabilize the

eigenvalue spectrum, in theory and in experiments. Inclusion of the Blasius transverse ﬂow

VB(y), on the other hand, has a very weak destabilizing eﬀect on the theoretical eigenvalue

spectrum of that problem.

To account for larger discrepancies between theory and observation, a variety of

treatments of non-parallel eﬀects have been attempted for the Blasius boundary layer

([29],[30],[31],[32], [33],[34]). But, as pointed out by Fasel & Konzelmann [35], all these non-

parallel treatments necessarily involve approximations and the discrepancies among results

are likely tied to diﬀerences among the particular approximations. Remaining disagreement

between theory and experiment are thus no longer believed to be due solely to non-parallel

eﬀects.

II. BASE FLOWS

The velocity u = (u, v, w)T is assumed to admit base ﬂow solutions of the form U =

(U(y), V (y), 0)T where U(y) alone describes an exactly parallel ﬂow in the x direction and

V (y) describes a transverse ﬂow component.

4

To examine the eﬀect of rotation on boundary layer stability, it is advantageous to begin

with well-known boundary layer solutions as base ﬂows and subject these to rotation. The

Blasius boundary layer and the asymptotic suction proﬁle are both nearly-parallel ﬂows that

are often assumed to be exactly parallel (V (y) is neglected). The x direction base ﬂow U(y)

is unaﬀected by rotation about the z-axis, although it calls for a cross-stream base pressure

gradient, dP/dy to balance the Coriolis force resulting from U(y). The transverse velocity

components of the Blasius boundary layer and the asymptotic suction layer are both weak,

but in the presence of frame rotation, V implies the need for a streamwise base x direction

pressure gradient dP/dx as well. In this work, rotation is assumed to be relatively weak;

because the transverse ﬂow is also weak, the Coriolis force resulting from V (y) is of the form

ΩV (y) and can be neglected, along with the corresponding pressure gradient dP/dx.

(NB: Applications of rotating boundary layers often involve ﬂow curvature; in this study

curvature is not assumed present. The combined eﬀects of curvature and rotation have been

studied previously for closely related channel ﬂows [27].)

A. BLASIUS BOUNDARY LAYER

The paradigmatic boundary layer ﬂow is that of the Blasius proﬁle, whose solution is

well-documented [28]. Blasius ﬂow is found from the solution of the self-similar problem

f ′′′ + f f ′′ = 0 ,

where f is the similarity streamfunction and primes denote diﬀerentiation with respect to the
U ∗/2νx, where U ∗ is the free-stream

similarity variable η = y/δ(x). The quantity δ(x) =

velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity, can be used to deﬁne the Blasius displacement

δB = δ(x) lim
η→∞

[η

f (η)] = 1.2168 δ(x) .

The Reynolds number Re = U ∗δB/ν is deﬁned based on the displacement thickness. The

similarity streamfunction f is related to the velocity U(y) and streamfunction Ψ through

Equation (1) does not have an analytic solution but is easily evaluated using straightforward

numerical schemes (The Falkner-Skan solutions built into MATLAB were used in this work).

The Blasius solution is preserved under weak rotation [20], as long as a base pressure

V (y) results in a modest shift of about 0.5% in Rec). The Blasius proﬁle U(y) is sketched

in Fig. 1; the displacement component V (y) is not shown.

B. ASYMPTOTIC SUCTION LAYER

Fluid ﬂowing parallel to a surface with uniform suction exhibits a boundary layer proﬁle

that does not vary in the downstream direction. The linear [44] and nonlinear [45],[46]

stability properties of this ﬂow have been long known [28]. With a constant downward
V ∗ ˆy imposed, the base ﬂow takes the form:

suction velocity V =

are exactly satisﬁed by Eqns.(6)-(7). This ﬂow has a lower boundary layer of thickness

and the Reynolds number based on the boundary layer thickness and ˆx velocity is Re =
U ∗δS/ν; note that V ∗/U ∗ = 1/Re. For weak suction (or large Re), the stability of this ﬂow is

sometimes examined as if it were exactly parallel, neglecting V ; in this study V is retained.

for both Blasius and asymptotic suction ﬂows. Ro > 0 therefore corresponds to oppositely

directed frame and ﬂow vorticities, or what is known in the geophysical literature as anti-

cyclonic.

δ = δB (or δS) and rotation scale Ω. The angular rotation of the frame, Ω = Ωˆz, is assumed

to be along the z direction and of constant magnitude Ω. The Rossby number is then
Ro = U ∗/2Ωδ while the Reynolds number can be given more generally as Re = U ∗δ/ν;

viscosity ν and density ρ are assumed constant.

The Navier Stokes equations (9)-(10) are perturbed away from the base ﬂow. Following

In calculating temporal stability of disturbances, α, β are assumed to be purely real while

ω is complex; a mode having Im(ω) < 0 will be temporally unstable. Instability in bound-

ary layers is ordinarily described using spatial theory since unstable modes are known to

grow as they propagate downstream. Spatial and temporal results can be simply related

using Gaster’s transformation, but only in the neighborhood of neutral stability. Transient

growth may also be approached temporally or spatially. Recent spatial analyses of boundary

layer transient growth are more valuable in making direct comparison with experiment and

for predicting transition (see [39],[40],[41],[43] or [42]). Interestingly, optimal disturbances

found using spatial theory are very similar to those found using temporal theory (see, eg.,

[10],[38],[37]).

The initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is formed, closely following the method of
Schmid and Henningson [15], by deﬁning initial conditions ˆv(t = 0) = ˆv0 and ˆζ(t = 0) = ˆζ0.
It is convenient to also deﬁne q = ˜qe−iωt where ˜q = (˜v, ˜ζ)T . Then the IBVP can be written

IV. STABILITY CALCULATIONS

In this work three-dimensional disturbances are considered from the point of view of

both transient ampliﬁcation and spectral instability for the ﬁrst time for rotating boundary

layer ﬂow. A Chebyshev collocation algorithm developed in previous work [47] was used

to evaluate the stability problem deﬁned above. Transient ampliﬁcation calculations were

implemented according to the method given by Reddy and Henningson [12] and the algo-

rithms of Schmid and Henningson [15]. To facilitate the expansion, the linear problem is

deﬁned on the interval [

1, 1] for which the Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal. The

eigenfunctions can then be written:

−

˜v(y) =

κnTn(y)

and

˜ζ(y) =

where N is the number of polynomials used, typically 150 or less in this work. Derivatives of

eigenfunctions are evaluated directly using the recurrence relations given by linear combina-

tions of lower order Chebyshev polynomials. Because of the semi-inﬁnite domain boundary

layer ﬂows have a continuous spectrum in addition to a ﬁnite discrete spectrum.

In the

calculations performed here, the semi-inﬁnite domain was approximated by a suﬃciently

large domain, a method known to be eﬀective [10]. In practice, the domain extended to

sixteen displacement thicknesses.

10

The eigenvalue problem (22) and (23), (31) or (32) is then transformed into a correspond-

ing 2N

2N matrix problem for the expansion coeﬃcients, with additional rows added to

include the boundary conditions. Since the matrix M is often singular, a QZ algorithm is

×

used.

A. MODAL STABILITY PROPERTIES: NEUTRAL CURVES

Early inviscid theory [24],[23] showed that the stability problem of rotating shear ﬂows was

analogous to that of Boussinesq convection where vorticity

(dU/dy

2Ω) played the role

−

−

of temperature gradient. The corresponding criterion required for instability was that the

vorticity be negative somewhere in the ﬂow and the most unstable modes had no streamwise

dependence, matching observations.

Blasius boundary layer – Without rotation the Blasius basic state is eigenvalue unstable

to two- and three-dimensional Tollmien-Schlichting modes. Blasius ﬂow exhibits the classi-

cal boundary-layer neutral stability curve in Re
ReC ≈
ing Squire’s Theorem, the most unstable eigenvalues are associated with two-dimensional

520 (smaller when V (y) is included) and a critical x-wavenumber αC ≈

α space, with a critical Reynolds number

0.3. Follow-

−

disturbances having β = 0. Figure 2 gives the neutral stability curves of three-dimensional

disturbances in α

β wavenumber space for Blasius ﬂow at Re = 600. The region of instabil-

−

ity visible in the upper left corner of the ﬁgure is that of the classic TS modes; in accordance

with Squire’s theorem, the most unstable modes in this region are two-dimensional and lie

along β = 0. When weak rotation is included, these TS modes are only slightly destabilized,

as seen in the slight enlargement of those neutral curves.

More importantly, another eigenvalue unstable region appears for anti-cyclonic rotation,

spanning a range of β and based at α = 0. The growth rates of these small-α modes are

an order of magnitude or more larger than the growth rates of TS disturbances at the same

Re. This instability has been previously revealed and explained [24],[23] many times before

– it is essentially inviscid and two-dimensional, having no streamwise variation (α = 0).

In experiments [24] this instability is manifest as streamwise-oriented rolls. For stronger

rotations than shown in the ﬁgure (Ro < 50), the two unstable regions merge, although as

the rotation further strengthens, the small-α instability is eventually suppressed. Figure 3

gives an overview of this rotational instability by showing the growth rate for a range of

11

Rossby numbers, including the re-stabilization that occurs at small Ro.

Suction layer – Uniform suction is known to strongly stabilize TS instability of boundary

layer ﬂows [28]; this eﬀect is very apparent in the large critical Reynolds number of the
asymptotic suction proﬁle (Rec ≈
aﬀected by rotation. The TS unstable region in α

70000). As in Blasius ﬂow, the TS instability is negligibly

β wavenumber space is also found along

−

the α axis, centered on α = 0.15 (this region is not shown in Fig. 4).

The modal stability of asymptotic suction ﬂow is aﬀected by rotation in much the same

way as is Blasius boundary layer ﬂow. Suction ﬂow under cyclonic rotation (Ro < 0)

develops no new unstable region, but for anti-cyclonic rotation, a second unstable region

develops along α = 0. Analogously to Blasius ﬂow, as the rotation becomes stronger the

range of unstable spanwise wavenumbers β ﬁrst increases and eventually shrinks as the

rotational instability is suppressed. Several values of frame rotation are used to calculate

the rotationally unstable regions in α

β wavenumber space, presented in Fig. 4. The eﬀect

−

of stronger rotation on the growth rate of this rotational instability is shown in Fig. 5, where

the similarity to Fig.3 is evident. Note that for very small Ro the disturbance equations

(22)-(23) become less valid.

B. TRANSIENT AMPLIFICATION

Transient ampliﬁcation in shear has been known since Orr [5], and is now understood to

be an eﬀect of the properties of a system’s eigenvectors, showing that study of the eigenvalues

is incomplete. When a system’s eigenvectors are not orthogonal, arbitrary initial conditions

can experience signiﬁcant transient growth. A very clear geometric explanation of this eﬀect

has been given by Schmid and Henningson [15]. Following the formulation used in that

work, let G(t) represent the maximum possible energy ampliﬁcation at time t, where G is

optimized over all possible initial conditions for each instant in time. Then deﬁne

boundary layer ﬂows are well-known: (i) ampliﬁcation factors of three-dimensional distur-

1000. Some general properties of transient growth in

bances are generally much larger than those of two-dimensional disturbances; and (ii) the

maximum growth factors grow with the Reynolds number. Rotating Blasius and suction

proﬁles maintain these properties, but also exhibit some particular features:

Blasius boundary layer – Blasius ﬂow subject to cyclonic rotation exhibits strongly

ampliﬁed disturbances of truly three-dimensional character – it is possible to identify (see
Fig.6a) a largest, or peak GMAX ∼
implying an oblique character. In contrast, when the rotation is anti-cyclonic the maximum

≈

ampliﬁcation factors are much larger, but the region of peak GM AX values in Fig.6c coincides

with the eigenvalue unstable region seen in Fig. 2. The strong eigenvalue instability is

expected to dominate any transient ampliﬁcation in this case. Peak growth factors also take

on a quasi-two-dimensional character when Ro = 0, lying along α = 0, as shown in Fig.6(b).

Similar results have been found in experiments [36] on non-rotating boundary layer ﬂows.

In subcritical ﬂow subject to anti-cyclonic rotation, there are no unstable eigenvalues but

transient growth is present. The properties of the peak GM AX values are examined in more

detail in the next section.

Suction layer – The peak GM AX values follow the same trend as those of Blasius ﬂow,

the largest GM AX values occurring for anti-cyclonic rotation. The spatial structure of the

maximum ampliﬁcation factors of suction ﬂow have a slightly diﬀerent character than those

of Blasius ﬂow: for all values of Ro, including no rotation, the most ampliﬁed disturbance

remains always three-dimensional (α is never zero). Again, however, for anti-cyclonic rota-

tion the optimal disturbances and the unstable modes both try to occupy the same region

of α

β space. It is not necessarily meaningful to examine details of the optimal transient

−

disturbance in this region of strong eigenvalue instability. While the streamwise wavenumber

of the optimal disturbance remains nearly constant, α

0.0125, its spanwise wavenumber,

β, shifts slightly from β

1.5 when Ro =

104 to β

1.75 without rotation, to β

2.5

−
when Ro = +104. As with Blasius ﬂow, when cyclonic frame rotation becomes strong, the

peak GM AX value achieved in the α

β plane is decreased, as demonstrated by Fig.7.

C. OPTIMAL DISTURBANCES

To clarify the eﬀect of rotation in the modally stable cyclonic regime, the peak GM AX

value found in the α

β neighborhood of Fig. 6 is plotted, in Fig. 8, for a range of Ro

−

values. This ﬁgure was obtained by calculating a sequence of ﬁgures like those of Fig.6

and extracting the peak GM AX value and its location in α

β space. Figure 8 shows

−

that for strong cyclonic rotation, peak GM AX values are suppressed, but not eliminated; as

expected, peak GM AX values retain their dependence on the Reynolds number. Also shown

is the streamwise wavenumber α at which the peak GM AX value is found. As the cyclonic

rotation becomes stronger, the optimal disturbance develops greater streamwise variation.

(In suction ﬂow, the peak α value changes very little and β changes only slightly, so peak

properties are shown here only for the Blasius case.)

Comparison of the peak ampliﬁcation factors GM AX for three-dimensional disturbances

and of the eigenvalue properties of the same disturbances under rotation reveals that the

modes most likely to grow, whether modal or non-modal, have a similar structure.

In

both cases, the largest growth is found for “modes” with weak or vanishing streamwise

dependence (α

0) and relatively large spanwise periodicity (β

O(1)). As is already

≈

∼

known for ordinary boundary layer ﬂows, such disturbances appear as vortices elongated

in the streamwise direction [10], [37]. These structures are often seen in the laboratory,

appearing as spanwise packed rows of rolls aligned with their axes parallel to each other and

to the direction of the ﬂow. The commonly observed streamwise streaks of boundary layer

ﬂows are a direct consequence of modiﬁcations to the downstream velocity, via the lift-up

eﬀect, by these vortices.

The weak streamwise variation of the most ampliﬁed disturbances in Blasius and suction

ﬂows implies that they will appear as oblique streamwise vortices, and subsequently as

streaks. This is veriﬁed by calculating the shape of the most ampliﬁed disturbance. An

example of the ﬂow associated with the most ampliﬁed disturbance of rotating Blasius ﬂow

is shown in Fig. 9; the perspective is looking downstream, taking advantage of the weak

streamwise variation of the disturbance.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Early work [24],[23] showed that the stability problem of rotating shear ﬂows is analogous

to that of Boussinesq convection where vorticity

(dU/dy

2Ω) plays the role of temperature

−

−

gradient, the Coriolis force acting like a buoyancy. The corresponding criterion required for

instability was that the vorticity be negative somewhere in the ﬂow, or, equivalently, that

the rotation be anti-cyclonic with respect to the vorticity of the base ﬂow. The resulting

unstable mode takes the form of roll cells aligned along the ﬂow. Roll cells aligned with the

ﬂow are also very commonly seen in some forms of shear ﬂow transition.

In this work the stability theory of rotating shear ﬂows has been extended to three-

dimensional disturbances of the Blasius and asymptotic suction boundary layer ﬂows. Eigen-

value and maximum transient growth factors were calculated and compared for the two

ﬂows. Under anti-cyclonic rotation, the large transient ampliﬁcation factors found for three

dimensional disturbances are dominated by eigenvalue unstable modes of similar character

– namely, near-zero streamwise wavenumber and large spanwise wavenumber. Anti-cyclonic

rotation increases the maximum transient growth factors in non-parallel Blasius and suction

boundary layer ﬂows. Under cyclonic rotation, transient ampliﬁcation in rotating boundary

layers persists even as the rotational instability is not present. TS modes are, of course,

still possible if Re > Rec. While stronger rotation diminishes the peak ampliﬁcation factors,

transient growth remains signiﬁcant at all Ro. In rotating boundary layer ﬂow, the optimal

disturbances also tend to greater streamwise variation as the cyclonic rotation strengthens.

No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the qualitative properties of disturbances

in rotating Blasius and rotating suction ﬂow. This result may be considered somewhat

surprising in light of the opposite senses of the non-parallel ﬂow components V (y) of these

two ﬂows. Recall that suction stabilizes the ordinary eigenvalue spectrum, while blowing

destabilizes it. In this work the inclusion of the transverse component of the base ﬂow, while

arguably good to do, has contributed little to the nature of the results here (concurrent

exactly parallel calculations were performed in all cases).

Transient ampliﬁcation factors are known to scale with the Reynolds number of the ﬂow.

It is therefore anticipated that the results presented here will be most useful in dealing

with geophysical and astrophysical ﬂows, where Reynolds numbers are extremely large. We

point out in particular the example of Keplerian ﬂow in an accretion disk, where no purely

15

hydrodynamic linear eigenvalue instability has been identiﬁed. Ioannou and Kakouris [48]

have recently performed a complete analysis of the transient ampliﬁcation of disturbances

in two-dimensional accretion disks. It is hoped that transient growth as addressed here will

prove to be useful in the understanding of instability and turbulence in such large Reynolds

number rotating ﬂows.

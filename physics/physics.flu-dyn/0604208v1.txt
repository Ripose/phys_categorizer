Particles held by springs in a linear shear ﬂow exhibit oscillatory motion

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

The dynamics of small spheres, which are held by linear springs in a low Reynolds number shear
ﬂow at neighboring locations is investigated. The ﬂow elongates the beads with the springs and
the interplay of the shear gradient with the nonlinear behavior of the hydrodynamic interaction
among the spheres causes in a large range of parameters a bifurcation to a surprising oscillatory
bead motion in their potential valleys. The parameter ranges, wherein this bifurcation is either
super- or subcritical, are determined.

Introduction.- Studies about the motion of bacteria
and ﬂagella in a ﬂuid, about the dynamics of blood
cells and other small suspended objects such as poly-
mers in simple ﬂows are currently of central interest
and count to one of the major issues of microﬂuidics
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. According to
the short spatial scales involved in these cases the ﬂuid
motion surrounding the particles can be described in the
small Reynolds numbers limit [1, 2, 3, 4], by the linear
Stokes equation [1, 4].

The hydrodynamic interaction (HI) between neighbor-
ing blood cells, swimming bacteria, diﬀerent segments of
a polymer or between neighboring polymers is of nonlin-
ear nature even in the limit of low Reynolds numbers [14].
Moreover, this nonlinear behavior may cause dynamical
eﬀects, such as the periodic motion of small sedimenting
spheres [15, 16] or the synchronization eﬀects between ro-
tating strings and between cilia [17, 18], or it may cause
a hydrodynamic coupling of particles in optical vortices
[19]. The HI may also amplify thermal ﬂuctuations of
polymers [22] to mention only a few examples.

Free single polymers show already a complex dynam-
ical behavior in shear ﬂow [7, 8] and the hydrodynamic
interaction between many polymers leads to the so-called
elastic turbulence [5, 6]. Furthermore polymers ﬁxed at
one end in a plug ﬂow are also a major issue [20, 21]
where one ﬁnds in this case signiﬁcant hydrodynamic in-
teraction eﬀects both for the static as well as dynamic
properties of the tethered polymer [21, 22, 23]. Tethered
polymers in shear ﬂow have also been studied but so far
only a single polymer ﬁxed with one end at a wall was
considered [24, 25, 26, 27]. Recently, investigations have
been started in order to analyze the behavior of several
ﬂexible polymers ﬁxed with their ends at the top of neigh-
boring pillars [28] and exposed to a linear shear ﬂow. So
the interesting question arises quite naturally: what is
the dynamics of neighboring tethered polymers in shear
ﬂow and which role plays the hydrodynamic interaction?
We mimic a situation of interacting tethered polymers
by spheres anchored by springs and neglect in a ﬁrst ap-

proach thermal ﬂuctuations. To the best of our knowl-
edge this is the ﬁrst example where an oscillatory motion
of bound particles in a simple ﬂow has its origin in the
hydrodynamic interaction.

FIG. 1: The three particle conﬁguration in shear ﬂow is
shown. The corners of the triangle in the y − z-plane mark
the minima of the harmonic potentials of the respective beads.
The ﬂow induced sphere displacements are indicated by the
dashed lines, which visualize the springs. h measures the shift
of the lower side of the triangle from the center of the shear
ﬂow, u(0) = 0.

Model.- We investigate the dynamics of three beads
which are ﬁxed in a shear ﬂow by linear springs with
a spring constant k. The locations of the minima of
the corresponding harmonic potentials, Ri (i = 1, 2, 3),
build, if not stated otherwise, an equilateral triangle of
sidelength b and height H = b/√2 with the upper cor-
ner at R1 = (0, h + H, 0) and the two lower corners at
R2,3 = (0, h,
b/2). The bead-springs are elongated by
a linear shear ﬂow

riences in a ﬂow with shear viscosity η. Each of the three
ﬁxed particles causes a perturbation of the ﬂow ﬁeld at
the location of the other beads and vice versa. This so
called hydrodynamic interaction is described for a Stokes

the linear springs change nonlinearly as a function of the
ﬂow velocity, which itself varies linearly with the height
h/a, as depicted in Fig. 2 for τ ˙γ = 2.6.

d;3 =

d;3 = y0

For h = 0 the ﬂow velocity vanishes at the positions
of bead 2 and 3 and with a ﬁnite shear gradient ˙γ only
the upper bead 1 is displaced. Bead 1 then causes a ﬂow
perturbation which shifts both beads 2 and 3 downward,
as indicated by the curve y0
d;2 in Fig. 2, and in
z0
z-direction towards larger values of z0
d;2. With
increasing values of h the ﬂow velocity becomes ﬁnite at
the location of bead 2 and 3 too and the two beads excite
also ﬂow perturbations, that point at the position of bead
1 downward in y-direction. This involves y0
d;1 to become
negative as well, remaining for small h however larger
than y0
d;3. In z-direction both disturbances compensate
each other, so that z0
d;1 = 0 is left unchanged. Since both
perturbations in y-direction are added bead 1 is stronger
elongated at intermediate values of h. According to the
stronger displacement of bead 1 in y-direction the relative
distance between the upper and the two lower beads is
reduced and therefore the ﬂow perturbations caused by
bead 1 at the positions of the other beads are enhanced,

and so are the values of
d;3|
|
This is the qualitative picture describing the trend of
the stationary displacements for intermediate values of h.
It is however very surprising that all these displacements
reach extrema and become smaller again for further in-
creasing values of h. An explanation of this behavior
may be oﬀered by inspecting the bead positions at large
values of h/a. In this case the triangle built by the bead
positions is again nearly parallel to the y
z plane and
accordingly the ﬂow perturbations caused at the neigh-
boring beads are nearly vanishing compared to their ex-
ternal force. In this limit, however, the height H of the
triangle is smaller and the distance between the beads 2
and 3 is larger than for a vanishing ﬂuid velocity. The
latter behavior is a consequence of a complex balance be-
tween the spring forces and the nonlinear forces due to
the ﬂow disturbances. Correspondingly there is hitherto
no simple qualitative picture for both, the deformed tri-
angle built by the beads and the decreasing behavior of
the elongation beyond their extrema.

Threshold of the Hopf bifurcation.- Slightly beyond the
extrema shown in Fig. 2 the stationary bead displace-
ments become unstable and one ﬁnds in numerical simu-
lations of Eqs. (2) a bifurcation to oscillatory bead mo-
tions. The threshold of this bifurcation may be deter-
mined by a linear stability analysis of the stationary elon-
d;i with respect to small perturbations δri(t). Us-
gation r0
i + δri(t), a linearization of Eqs. (2)
ing the ansatz ri = r0
leads to a set of 9 linear diﬀerential equations with con-
stant coeﬃcients

growth rate σ(h), with a ﬁnite imaginary part ω is posi-
tive within a ﬁnite range of h/a as shown in in Fig. 3 for
three diﬀerent values of the dimensionless shear rate τ ˙γ.
The whole range of a positive σ(h) in the τ ˙γ
h/a plane
is given by the shaded range in Fig. 4. The occurrence of
oscillatory bead motion is rather robust with respect to
changes of the anchor points of the linear springs which
adhere the beads. We have testet this by changing the
anchor point of bead 1 and 2 in all three spatial direc-
tions. With such modiﬁcations the three anchor points
build either no equilateral triangle or the equilateral tri-
angle is inclined and not anymore perpendicular to the
ﬂow direction. The major trends are the following ones.
Bringing anchor points closer together enhances the hy-
drodynamic interaction which favors the Hopf bifurcation
in a larger parameter range and it then takes also place
at smaller shear rates and h.

Nonlinear behavior of the bead oscillations.- A typi-
cal example for the three dimensional oscillatory motion
of the beads is given by a projection onto the x-axis
in Fig. 5a). Here the deviations re,i = (xe;i, ye;i, ze;i)
from the center of mass of the stationary solutions rcm =
r0
i /3 are displayed. Two characteristic features
can be recognized. Bead 2 and 3 oscillate with a phase
P
shift of π and bead 1 oscillates along the x-direction with
twice the frequency of the other two beads. The double
frequency of bead 1 is an eﬀect of the projection onto the
x-axis, as can be seen from the phase portrait in Fig. 5b).

Similar phase portraits can be obtained in the x
the y
z plane as well. Bead 1 performs simultaneously
periodic motions in x- and y-direction and accordingly
bead 2 and 3 are pushed away by a phase shift of π as

indicated in Fig. 5a).

Along the solid line bounding the grey shaded range in
Fig. 4a) the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical. Along the
dashed bounding line the Hopf bifurcation is subcritical
and the range of hysteresis beyond this dashed line is
indicated by the striped range. The oscillation amplitude
δr2
i of one bead is shown in Fig. 4b) as a function of h/a
at the shear rate τ ˙γ = 2.6 . It indicates the supercritical
behavior at the lower threshold and the hysteresis at the
upper threshold. Close to the threshold where the Hopf
bifurcation is supercritical the oscillations are harmonic.
Further away from this threshold and in the parameter
range with hysteresis, cf. Fig. 4a), the periodic motion
becomes rather anharmonic.

Conclusions.- We study in this work a Hopf bifurcation
of three bounded spheres in a low Reynolds number linear
shear ﬂow, which is induced by the interplay of the non-
linear behavior of hydrodynamic interaction between the
spheres and the shear gradient. To the best of our knowl-
edge it is the ﬁrst description of oscillations of bounded
and hydrodynamically interacting particles in a Stokes
ﬂow. Most of the results are obtained for three beads
anchored by linear springs at the corner of an equilateral
triangle which is perpendicularly oriented with respect
to the ﬂow direction. The phenomenon is very robust
against various variations of the anchor points.

Our ﬁndings for three beads may also guide inves-

tigations on several tethered and hydrodynamically in-
teracting polymers ﬁxed at small spheres and held by
laser tweezers or anchored at boundaries in shear ﬂow
as well as for polymers that are ﬁxed in shear ﬂow close
to boundaries at the top of pillars [28]. It is also an in-
teresting question to be addressed, whether a recently
discussed cyclic motion for grafted polymers [24, 26, 27]
is related to the Hopf bifurcation discussed here.

Since the Hopf bifurcation depends crucially on the
nonlinear nature of the hydrodynamic interaction we ex-
pect that several modiﬁcations favoring oscillatory mo-
tion: Nonlinear spring constants (which mimic for in-
stance tethered polymers), diﬀerent spring constants in
diﬀerent directions or an exposition of the three beads to
Poiseuille ﬂow with its spatially dependend shear rate.
These and other extensions are the subject of forthcom-
ing work.

Abstract

Data assimilation is used in numerical simulations of laboratory ex-
periments in a stratiﬁed, rotating ﬂuid. The experiments are performed
on the large Coriolis turntable (Grenoble, France), which achieves a high
degree of similarity with the ocean, and the simulations are performed
with a two-layer shallow water model. Since the ﬂow is measured with a
high level of precision and resolution, a detailed analysis of a forecasting
system is feasible. Such a task is much more diﬃcult to undertake at
the oceanic scale because of the paucity of observations and problems of
accuracy and data sampling. This opens the way to an experimental test
bed for operational oceanography. To illustrate this, some results on the
baroclinic instability of a two-layer vortex are presented.

1 Introduction : operational issues

An increasing interest in operational oceanography has developed in recent
years. A number of pre-operational projects have emerged at the national and
international scale, most of them coordinating their activites within the inter-
national Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE).

The heart of operational systems consists of three main components : the
observation system, the dynamical model and the data assimilation scheme.
Thanks to recent advances in satellite and in-situ observations, numerical mod-
elling, assimilation techniques and computer technology, the operational systems
have now acquired some degree of maturity. However, there are still a number
of issues that must be solved in applications, and validation tests are needed.

The ideal method for validating the overall forecasting system would be
to compare results with independent oceanic observations, i.e. observations
that are not used in the assimilation process. However, such observations are
rare because in-situ surveys are diﬃcult to undertake and extremely expensive,
particularly in the deep ocean. Another problem is that, because assimilation
is only approximate, forecast errors may be due not only to the model itself,
but also to the temporal growth of imperfections in the initial condition. It is
therefore diﬃcult to objectively identify the model errors on the one hand and
the assimilation errors on the other.

Alternatively, analytical solutions of simple ﬂows with well-deﬁned initial
and boundary conditions can be used as a reference to unravel some aspects of
the model error components. However, such analytical solutions are limited to
some extremely simpliﬁed ﬂow conﬁgurations.

In this letter, a new, experimental approach to these problems is presented.
Laboratory experiments and numerical, shallow water simulations of simple
oceanic ﬂows are performed and sequential data assimilation is used as a tool
to keep the numerical simulation close to the experimental reality. By contrast
with real-scale oceanic measurements, the experimental measurements are avail-
able with a high level of precision and resolution. The general methodology is
given in Section 2. In Section 3, the example of un unstable vortex in a two-
layer, rotating ﬂuid is presented as an illustration of the experimental test-bed.
In particular, the behaviour of the model is studied when data assimilation is
stopped. The vortex deformation and splitting as predicted by the numerical
simulation is then compared to the real ﬂow evolution.

2 The Coriolis test-bed

Laboratory experiments are of particular interest as test cases for operational
systems, ﬁlling the gap between the oversimpliﬁed analytical solutions and the
full complexity of real oceans. On the one hand, they are much more realistic
than any numerical or theoretical “reality”, provided that the experimental
facility allows good similarity with the ocean. On the other hand, data are
available with much better space and time resolution than actual scale oceanic

1

measurements. Furthermore, a great number of experiments can be performed
and compared to one other. Such comparisons are obviously impossible at the
real scale because of the ever changing ﬂow conditions in the ocean. The ﬂow
parameters can also be easily varied to perform parametric studies.

Thanks to its large size (13 meter diameter), the Coriolis turntable (Greno-
ble, France) is a unique facility which enables oceanic ﬂows to be reproduced
with a good level of similarity (see Fig.1). It is possible to come close to inertial
regimes, i.e. with limited eﬀects of viscosity and centrifugal forces. Various ex-
periments can be performed on the turntable in multi-layer stratiﬁed salt water,
such as experiments on vortices or boundary currents.

Our approach relies on numerical simulation of such laboratory experiments
using data assimilation, in a similar way to real-scale ocean forecasting systems.
A major diﬀerence with the real ocean is that the measured quantity here is the
velocity ﬁeld in several horizontal planes instead of scalar quantities measured
only at the surface or along vertical sections. The elevation of the interface
between the layers is not measured in the experiments.
It is treated as an
output of the asssimilation process (see section 3).

The velocity ﬁeld is measured in horizontal planes using CIV (Correlation
Image Velocimetry): particle tracers are illuminated by a horizontal laser sheet
and a camera is used to visualize the particle displacements from above, lead-
ing, after numerical treatment, to the horizontal velocity ﬁeld. The rms mea-
surement error in particle displacement is about 0.2 pixels, as determined by
Fincham & Delerce (2000), and the errors found in neighboring points are not
correlated. The resulting error in velocity about 3% of the maximum velocity.
In parallel with these measurements, numerical simulations are performed.
The system is modelled as a multi-layer ﬂuid with hydrostatic approximation
for which the variables are the horizontal velocity components u(x, y, i) and
v(x, y, i), and the layer thickness h(x, y, i), where x and y are the horizontal co-
ordinates and i is the layer index. The basic shallow-water equations are solved
using MICOM (Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model, Bleck & Boudra
1986) in its simplest version.

The measured velocity ﬁeld is assimilated into the simulations at each mea-
surement point using an adaptive version of the Singular Evolutive Extended
Kalman (SEEK) ﬁlter, a method adapted for oceanographic purposes on the
basis of the Kalman ﬁlter. Each data assimilation provides a new dynami-
cal state which optimally blends the model prediction and the measured data,
in accounting for their respective error. The forecast state vector Xf is re-
placed by the analysed state vector Xa = Xf + K[Yo − HXf ] ,where Yo is
the observed part of the state vector (i.e. the velocity ﬁeld in the measurement
domain), H is the observation operator and K is the Kalman gain deﬁned by
K = Pf HT [HPf HT + R]−1. Here, Pf and R are the forecast error and obser-
vation error covariance matrices respectively. The observation errors are here
supposed to be uniform, and the multi-variate correlations between the vari-
ables are described as components on Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF’s)
computed from the model statistics, providing an estimation of Pf . The reader

3 Example : Baroclinic instability of a two-layer

vortex

Among the various experiments performed on the Coriolis turntable, concern-
ing, for example, baroclinic instability and coastal currents, the study of the
baroclinic instability of a two-layer vortex is presented in the present letter be-
cause it provides a good illustration of the experimental test-bed. This ﬂow
problem is of particular interest because simple experiments are feasible as well
as numerical simulations, although it is quite a complex non-linear process (e.g.
Griﬃths and Linden 1981) and plays a crucial role in the variability of the real
ocean. The initial conditions are well deﬁned and the lateral boundaries have
no signiﬁcant inﬂuence.

A cylinder of radius R = 0.5 m is initially introduced in a two-layer ﬂuid
across the interface (see Fig. 1). A displacement η0 of the interface is produced
inside the cylinder, and at t = 0 the cylinder is rapidly removed. A radial gravity
current is then initiated, which is deviated by the Coriolis force, resulting in the
formation of a vortex in the upper layer after damping of inertial oscillations. A
vortex of opposite sign is produced in the lower layer, and the resulting vertical
shear is a source of baroclinic instability. The main control parameter in this
system is γ = R/RD, where RD is the Rossby deformation radius. The results
presented here were obtained with γ = 4. The vortex then undergoes baroclinic
instability which gives rise to splitting into two new vortices.

The experimental vortex is dynamically similar to an oceanic vortex with
a radius of the order of 100 km at mid-latitude (the radius of deformation is
typically 25 km). In the experiments, vortex instability takes place in typically
20 rotation periods of the tank, corresponding to about 30 days at mid-latitude
(taking the inverse of the Coriolis parameter as the relevant time unit). The
ratio of the vertical to the horizontal scales is distorted by a factor of 10 in the
experiments. This is not important provided that the hydrostatic approximation
is valid.

The velocity ﬁeld is measured in each layer every 11 s, which is half the
observed period of inertial oscillations. Since we are interested in the slow bal-
anced dynamics, we eliminate the residual inertial oscillations by averaging two
successive ﬁelds for data assimilation. The velocity data obtained are assimi-
lated in the numerical model at each grid point in the measurement domain (2.5
m × 2.5 m). In the numerical simulations, the system is modelled as a two-layer
ﬂuid with a standard biharmonic dissipation term and the simulation domain
is 5 m wide (i.e. twice as large as the measurement domain) in order to avoid
spurious conﬁnement by boundaries. The simulations are performed using 1002
or 2002 grid points in each layer.

A good ﬁt is then obtained between the model and the experimental data,
as shown in Fig. 2. The irregular shape of the vortex, the position of its center

4

and the presence of residual currents in its vicinity are well represented. The
elongation of the vortex and the formation of two new, smaller vortices are also
well reproduced. Data assimilation provides us with an indirect measurement
of the interface depth, also shown in Fig. 2. No signiﬁcant inertio-gravity wave
is excited in the simulation after data assimilation is performed, showing that
the interface position is well determined, without any spurious imbalance eﬀect.
The initial development of baroclinic instability is well described by the
growth of mode two (calulated using a polar Fourier decomposition of the radial
velocity ﬁeld along a circle of radius R). Excellent agreement between the model
and the observation is obtained when data assimilation is performed, as shown
in Fig. 3. The growth of this mode is considerably delayed in the model without
data assimilation, as the initial perturbation is smaller than in the experiments.
The rms distance between the forecast and measured velocity ﬁelds is plotted
in Fig. 4. After a few assimilation cycles, this distance remains of the order of
0.6 mm.s−1, close to the experimental errors (3% of the maximum velocity, i.e.
about 0.5 mm.s−1). Similar agreement is obtained in both layers.

The state vector obtained at a given time can be used as an initial condition
to test the free model. To do so, we stop the assimilation at time t = 75s and
measure the growth of the rms distance between the laboratory experiments and
the free model run with this new initial state, as shown in Fig. 4. This growth
can be due either to the ampliﬁcation of small initial errors, or to limitations of
the dynamical model. It is actually possible to show that the sensitivity to the
initial condition is not the dominant eﬀect, as observed in Fig. 5. It is clear in
this ﬁgure that the divergence of the model from the experimental reality is not
sensitive, over the short term, to small variations in the initial condition. The
model diverges from reality on a timescale of around 3000s, which is about 30
times the typical advection timescale of the ﬂow 2R/U ≃ 100s (where U ≃ 1
cm.s−1 is the order of magnitude of the velocity within the ﬂow). The model
error is therefore about 1/30 of the dominant advective term. This error is
actually small but seems to be systematic.

The results are similar when 1002 or 2002 numerical grid points are used in
each layer (see Fig. 4, 5 and 6). The eﬀect of dissipation and friction was also
investigated in various test runs. The rms distance to observations obtained in
the most representative of these test runs is plotted in Fig. 4. The results show
that the model errors persist when the numerical viscosity coeﬃcient is changed
or when an Ekman friction term is added in the momentum equation. We notice
that, in all cases, vortex splitting occurs faster than in the experimental reality
(Fig. 6).
It is therefore likely that the basic simplifying assumptions of the
hydrostatic, two-layer shallow-water formulation, rather than resolution, dissi-
pation or friction problems, are responsible for the limitations of the model. For
instance, the interface between the layers may have a ﬁnite thickness in reality,
leading to eﬀects that cannot be reproduced in the two-layer simulation. Also,
the hydrostatic approximation may slightly enhance the growth of baroclinic
instability, as shown in the theoretical study of non-hydrostatic eﬀects by Stone
(1971).

In the last stage of our testing procedure, we perform assimilation using only

5

upper layer data and check how the behavior of the lower layer is reconstructed.
The results are shown in Fig. 6. Although some local discrepancies are observed
in the bottom layer compared to the measured velocity ﬁeld, the global ﬂow ﬁeld
is well reproduced.

4 Conclusion

The results reported in the present letter illustrate the interest of an experimen-
tal test-bed for operational oceanography :

(i) Thanks to data assimilation, a complete description of the experimen-
tal ﬂow ﬁelds is obtained, including the non-measured variables. Any physical
quantity can then be calculated. Data assimilation can thus be used as a com-
plementary tool for experimental investigation and physical analysis of the ﬂow.
For instance, potential vorticity anomalies can be calculated, providing quanti-
ties which are generally impossible to measure but which are crucial to a better
understanding of the physics of the baroclinic instability.

(ii) The obtained ﬂow ﬁeld can be used as an initial condition to test the
numerical model. The divergence of the numerical model from reality is, in prin-
ciple, caused either by the sensitivity of system evolution to the initial condition,
or by the model error itself. We have checked that, in our test cases sensitivity
to weak variations in the initial condition is not the dominant eﬀect. This makes
it possible to quantify the systematic forecast errors. Thus, even weak model
errors can be detected, of the order of 1/30 of the dominant inertial term in
the present case. Such a weak model limitation would be probably much more
diﬃcult to detect in complex oceanic applications. Test runs were performed to
show that these model errors are not caused by resolution, dissipation or friction
problems. The most probable sources of error are the hydrostatic approxima-
tion or the two-layer formulation of the equations. Further work is needed to
test this hypothesis.

(iii) The accuracy of the assimilation scheme can also be analysed in detail.
The present study shows, for instance, how the assimilation scheme is able to
reconstruct the velocity ﬁeld of the lower layer from observation of the upper
layer. This is clearly of practical interest because vertical extrapolation of the
measured surface quantities is a great challenge in oceanography (see for instance
Hurlburt 1986).

Many other tests can of course be performed with the available data using
various dynamical models and/or assimilation schemes. Possible improvement
by non-hydrostatic models would be of particular interest. The study of other
processes is in progress, involving the instability of boundary currents, gravity
currents on a slope and current/topography interaction. The measurements ob-
tained from these experiments are available to other researchers on the Coriolis
web site (www.coriolis-legi.org) as a data base to test numerical models and
assimilation schemes.

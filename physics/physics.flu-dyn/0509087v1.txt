We investigate the relationship between the linear surface wave instabilities of a shallow viscous
ﬂuid layer and the shape of the periodic, parametric-forcing function (describing the vertical ac-
celeration of the ﬂuid container) that excites them. We ﬁnd numerically that the envelope of the
resonance tongues can only develop multiple minima when the forcing function has more than two
local extrema per cycle. With this insight, we construct a multi-frequency forcing that generates at
onset a non-trivial harmonic instability which is distinct from a subharmonic response to any of its
frequency components. We measure the corresponding surface patterns experimentally and verify
that small changes in the forcing cause a transition, through a bicritical point, from the predicted
harmonic short-wavelength pattern to a much larger standard subharmonic pattern. Using a for-
mulation valid in the lubrication regime (thin viscous ﬂuid layer) and a WKB method to ﬁnd its
analytic solutions [1, 2], we explore the origin of the observed relation between the forcing function
shape and the resonance tongue structure. In particular, we show that for square and triangular
forcings the envelope of these tongues has only one minimum, as in the usual sinusoidal case.

INTRODUCTION

In the Faraday system, an incompressible ﬂuid is oscil-
lated vertically in a container with a free upper surface,
generating standing surface waves which provide an ex-
cellent system for the study of pattern formation [3, 4].
Through an appropriate choice of experimental parame-
ters, many of the regular patterns that are possible in two
dimensions, such as stripes, squares and hexagons, can be
obtained. In addition, targets, spirals, superlattices and
quasipatterns lacking strict translational periodicity have
also been observed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

One of the advantages of the Faraday experiment,
when compared to other pattern-forming systems such as
convection or chemical reactions, is the great amount of
control over the energy feeding mechanism that can be
achieved by changing the periodic vertical acceleration
of the ﬂuid container. Even by forcing the system with
diﬀerent combinations of only two frequencies, several
distinct patterns can be achieved. Hexagonal and rhom-
boid patterns, together with various quasipatterns have
been obtained experimentally in [10, 11, 12] by varying
the amplitudes and the phase diﬀerence between both
components. Superlattice patterns [13, 14], triangular
patterns [15] and localized structures [16] have also been
observed using two-frequency forcings [17].

From a theoretical perspective, a combination of tools
must be used to understand and predict the pattern se-
lection. While its characteristic wavelength can be ob-
tained through a linear instability calculation, the two-
dimensional structure is determined by the nonlinear in-
teraction between modes [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. At
the linear level, the simplest cases occur when a deep
ﬂuid layer of low viscosity is oscillated with a sinusoidal
forcing proportional to cos(ωt). In these situations, the

frequency of the main (largest in amplitude) component
of the resulting surface wave oscillations will be ω/2 (re-
ferred to hereafter as the ﬁrst -or fundamental- subhar-
monic response). In other cases, two mechanisms for se-
lecting main frequency responses that are diﬀerent from
the ﬁrst subharmonic one have been identiﬁed.

The ﬁrst mechanism occurs when two or more fre-
quency components are introduced in the forcing.
In
these cases, each component will tend to excite its own
corresponding ﬁrst subharmonic mode. Their relative
amplitudes will determine which of these responses has
the lowest global forcing strength threshold, thus becom-
ing the instability that is observed at onset. The second
mechanism can only arise in the high viscosity regime. If
the ﬂuid layer is shallow enough, even a single component
forcing with low enough frequency can excite an instabil-
ity diﬀerent from the ﬁrst subharmonic one. As the vis-
cous boundary layer reaches the bottom of the ﬂuid con-
tainer, the threshold of the lowest unstable modes rises,
allowing others with higher main frequency components
(and, therefore, shorter surface wavelengths) to become
unstable at onset [25, 26].

In a numerical and experimental study, it was shown in
[27] that a transition between two patterns with diﬀerent
linearly unstable wavelengths can be obtained in various
ﬂuid regimes by changing the relative amplitudes of a
two-frequency forcing. This transition occurs through
a bicritical point, where both modes are simultaneously
linearly unstable. In spite of these results, only a limited
understanding of the eﬀects of both a multi-frequency
forcing and a high viscosity regime has been achieved.
Furthermore, little is known about the patterns expected
for more complicated forcing functions not described by
a few frequency components. This can be attributed to
the essentially inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom that
are needed to parametrize an arbitrary forcing function,

which renders a systematic exploration of the parameter
space impossible.

In this paper, we consider a diﬀerent and novel ap-
proach. Instead of exploring a large parameter space with
various forcing frequency components, we seek to iden-
tify which characteristics of the periodic forcing function
aﬀect the surface patterns and how. By performing a nu-
merical linear stability calculation in various test systems
of shallow viscous ﬂuid layers, we will ﬁrst identify a sim-
ple qualitative relation between the shape of the forcing
function and the resonance tongue structure (that de-
scribes the stability thresholds). Using this relation, we
will construct a forcing function with a non-trivial crit-
ical instability at onset, having a main frequency com-
ponent which does not correspond to the fundamental
subharmonic (or even harmonic) response to any of the
forcing terms. We will then present experimental results
showing the surface pattern generated by this instability.
Finally, in the lubrication limit of a thin viscous ﬂuid
layer, we will illustrate analytically the origin of the ob-
served relation between the forcing function and the sta-
bility thresholds. We will follow the method introduced
by Cerda and Tirapegui [1, 2] that derives a Mathieu
equation to describe this regime and uses a WKB ap-
proximation [28, 29] to solve it for single frequency forc-
ing. By extending these calculations to arbitrary forcing
functions we will develop an intuitive understanding of
the relation between the shape of the forcing function
and the structure of the resonance tongues. In particu-
lar, we will show that only forcing functions with more
than two local extrema per cycle are expected to allow
bicritical points involving non-contiguous tongues.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we re-
view the standard formulation of the Faraday wave linear
stability analysis. We introduce in Section III a family of
forcing functions parametrized by one parameter to illus-
trate numerically the relation between the shape of each
member of the family and the structure of its correspond-
ing neutral stability diagram. Section IV presents an ex-
perimental study that uses these forcing functions, dis-
playing a previously unobserved transition between two
surface patterns with very diﬀerent characteristic wave-
lengths. In Section V we show an approximate analytical
relation between the forcing and the instability response
that illuminates our approach. Finally, Section VI brieﬂy
discusses our results and presents our conclusions.

II. BACKGROUND

We study the linear stability of the free surface of an
incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid layer of depth h, density
ρ, kinematic viscosity ν and surface tension σ. The ﬂuid
is oscillated vertically with acceleration f (ωt), where ω is
the fundamental frequency of oscillation and t is the time.
We will summarize here the derivation of the equations
describing this system by following the presentation in
[30].

Therefore, Γ corresponds to the maximum acceleration

Equation (2) and boundary conditions (3) through (6)

Instead of
integrating them directly, our numerical analysis will fo-
cus on ﬁnding the stability threshold Γc(k) given by the
critical value of Γ at which the wavenumber k becomes
unstable.

III. NUMERICAL STUDY

A. Method

We are interested in ﬁnding numerically the neutral
stability curve Γc(k) for various forcing functions. With
this objective, we have extended the stability analysis

method of Kumar and Tuckerman [27, 30] to forcing func-
tions with an arbitrary number of frequency components.
In broad terms, this method consists ﬁrst in expanding
vk and ξk in a Floquet form

vk = e(µ+iφ)t

wj(z)eijωt + c.c.

Xj
ξk = e(µ+iφ)t

ζjeijωt + c.c..

Xj

(7)

(8)

Here, µ + iφ is the Floquet exponent, where we can set
the growth rate µ to 0 to obtain marginal stability curves
with harmonic (φ = 0) and subharmonic (φ = ω/2)
temporal responses. Equations (2)-(5) are then used to
rewrite (6) in the form

Anζn = Γ [f ζ]n ,

(9)

where An is an algebraic function of the system param-
eters, which does not depend on f (ωt), and [f ζ]n is the
n-th Fourier component of

f (ωt)

ζjeijωt.

Xj

(10)

By introducing the explicit form of f (ωt), equation (9)
can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem for the forcing
amplitude Γ which can then be solved through standard
numerical techniques.
In order to extend the method
to cases beyond the two-frequency forcing computed in
[27, 30], we implemented this algorithm in Mathematica
[31] and used the program’s symbolic algebra capabili-
ties to automatically compute [f ζ]n for any given f (ωt).
With this implementation, which is analogous to the one
presented in [32], we are able to obtain eﬃciently the
neutral stability curves for any desired forcing function,
regardless of its frequency content.

B. Results

We restrict our study to shallow viscous ﬂuid layers.
Since the speciﬁc value of the ﬂuid constants within this
regime does not change our qualitative results or analysis,
we will further reduce the size of the parameter space by
considering throughout the paper only one set of ﬂuid
constants. These are given by a density ρ = 0.95 g/cm3, a
surface tension σ = 20 dyn/cm and a viscosity ν = 46 cS.
Additionally, we will use in this section and in Section
IV a ﬂuid depth h = 0.3 cm and an oscillation frequency
ω = 2π (10 Hz).

By using the numerical techniques described above, we
explored the structure of the marginal stability curves
Γc(k) for many diﬀerent f (ωt) including various piece-
wise constant, piecewise linear, delta-like and multi-
frequency functions. While a precise characterization of
how the features of f (ωt) correlate to those of Γc(k) re-
mains to be achieved, one of the salient qualitative rela-
tions that we observed for all tested functions is a con-
nection between the extrema of f (ωt) and the envelope

of Γc(k) that will be described below. We will illustrate
it here for a speciﬁc family of forcing functions, which is
the same used in the experiments of Section IV.

|
|
bitrary choice which is not important for the qualitative
behavior that we will focus on here.
It was obtained
by searching for a one-parameter family of forcing func-
tions that simultaneously includes members with a sim-
ple triangular-like form (p
2) and others that can
produce non-trivial surface-wave instabilities in an ex-
perimentally accessible regime (p

≈ −

umn shows the corresponding neutral stability curves
Γc(k) which present the usual resonance tongue struc-
ture. The harmonic and subharmonic tongues indicate
regions where surface waves become unstable, oscillat-

≈

ing with a main frequency component that is an in-
tegral multiple (ω, 2ω, 3ω, . . .) or an odd half-multiple
(ω/2, 3ω/2, 5ω/2, . . .) of the fundamental
forcing fre-
quency, respectively. The tongues at higher k-values cor-
respond to instabilities with shorter surface wavelengths
and larger oscillation frequencies. As p is increased, the
forcing function changes from a simple rounded triangu-
lar shape with only two extrema per cycle to shapes with
richer structure. Correspondingly, the envelope deﬁned
by the tongue minima (sketched as a dashed line on the
ﬁgure) changes from a simple convex function with a sin-
gle minimum to a set of convex segments, each with its
own minimum.

We have observed a similar relation between the struc-
ture of the extrema of f (ωt) and the concavity of the res-
onance tongue’s envelope for all forcing functions tested
(triangular, square, multi-frequency, etc.) In particular,
every f (ωt) with only two extrema per cycle resulted in
an envelope with positive concavity for all k. This rela-
tion will be one of our main focuses in the remainder of
this paper.

It is important to point out that the changes in the
critical instabilities illustrated in Fig. 1 cannot be ex-
plained by a simple switch to a diﬀerent dominant forcing
frequency in fp(ωt) combined with the ﬁrst mechanism
described in the Introduction. Indeed, as p is increased
to 1 the lowest unstable region becomes the second har-
monic tongue (with main frequency component equal to
2ω) which does not correspond to the fundamental har-
monic or subharmonic responses (with equal or half the
frequency, respectively) to any of the three frequency
components of fp(ωt): ω, 3ω and 5ω. Furthermore, it
is apparent that the change in p cannot be characterized
as mainly reducing the stability threshold of a speciﬁc
tongue, but that it rather aﬀects the described envelope
over the entire range of k studied.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we present experimental results show-
ing that the appearance of multiple minima in the en-
velope of the resonance tongues can generate interesting
measurable eﬀects. By carefully choosing the form of the
forcing function, we ﬁnd a previously unobserved bicriti-
cal point between two surface patterns with very diﬀerent
characteristic wavelengths.

In our experiments, we use silicone oil with ρ =
0.95 g/cm3, σ = 20 dyn/cm and ν = 46 cS (Fluka Sili-
cone Oil AR 20), which are the same ﬂuid parameters
as in Section III. A 0.3 cm deep layer of this silicone oil
is contained in a cylindrical cell with a radius of 7.0 cm
and height of 4.0 cm. The cell has a PVC sidewall, a
0.8 cm thick glass bottom, and a 0.8 cm thick plexiglass
top covered with a light diﬀuser. It is mounted on the
10 cm2 linear air bearing, which is attached
ram of a 10
to a 180 kg triangular granite slab that ﬂoats on an air
table to minimize horizontal oscillations. A shaker (VTS

×

4

VG100) is suspended by springs from the air table sup-
ports. Two 50 cm long cylindrical aluminum tubes, each
with an inner and outer diameter of 0.48 cm and 0.95 cm,
respectively, connect the shaker to the ram. An ampli-
ﬁer (Crown CE2000) drives the shaker with a computer-
generated forcing function. The amplitudes and phases of
the desired Fourier components of the acceleration signal
are measured by an accelerometer (PCB Model 353B68)
and used as feedback to control the driving. The root-
mean-square diﬀerence between the measured and target
forcing functions is less than 1% while the variation in the
amplitudes of the driven components is less than 0.01%.
Since viscosity and surface tension are both sensitive to
temperature changes, the experiments are conducted in a
closed transparent box maintained at a constant temper-
0.005◦C). To visualize the waves, parallel light
ature (
is projected through the cell bottom. The curved ﬂuid
surface refracts the light, which then falls on the diﬀuser
producing a representation of the pattern. A CCD cam-
era synchronized with the forcing function acquires the
images.

±

Our speciﬁc choice of forcing function was determined
by searching for an experimentally achievable set of pa-
rameters having a linear instability at onset with a re-
sponse far from the usual subharmonic one. This objec-
tive is not easily achieved despite the fact that our numer-
ical exploration established that many forcing functions
generate resonance tongues with a multiple minima en-
velope. Indeed, for the ﬂuid parameters used in our ex-
periments, we found numerically that only at very low
values of h or ω it is possible to excite at onset a tongue
belonging to the second or higher (in order of increas-
ing k) envelope minimum. However, the range of these
two quantities is limited by our experimental apparatus.
For very shallow ﬂuid layers (h < 0.1 cm), spurious ef-
fects can aﬀect the patterns: surface waves may contact
the bottom of the container and a small tilt, variation
in the bottom proﬁle, or wetting at the wall can lead to
large changes in the relative ﬂuid depth ∆h/h. Addition-
ally, as h and ω are reduced, the critical acceleration Γc
increases. Because the maximum acceleration and am-
ω−2) of the apparatus are limited, much of
plitude (
this low ω/large Γ regime is inaccessible. By testing nu-
merically various forcing functions, we were able to con-
struct fp(ωt) with p
1, as deﬁned in (11), which has
a global minimum in the part of the envelope that does
not contain the ﬁrst subharmonic tongue (see Fig. 1d),
and which is experimentally accessible.

p = 0.9, p = 1.0 and p = 1.1. The ﬁgure shows a
very small change in the forcing function (see left panels)
producing a large jump in the critical wavenumber. For
p = 0.9 (top), the ﬁrst subharmonic tongue (with main
frequency component at ω/2) will be excited at onset.
Numerically, we compute a critical forcing ΓSH

the numerical results, Γc is within 10% and kc within 15%
of the predicted values. Given the pattern deformation
that is observed towards the image borders due to the
small aspect ratio (the size of the container is only about
twice the surface wavelength), these discrepancies are not
signiﬁcant. For p = 1.1, a pattern of small hexagons ap-
pears at Γc = 4.27, with a characteristic size of 0.9 cm,
which implies kc = 6.96. These measurements are within
4% (for Γc) and 9% (for kc) of the numerical predictions.
We have also veriﬁed in our experiments that, with re-
spect to the fundamental forcing frequency, the oscilla-
tions of the large pattern are subharmonic and those of
the small one are harmonic. Finally, at p = 1.0 (image
not shown), we observe that the system generates small
hexagons which are practically indistinguishable from the
ones at p = 1.1, with Γc = 4.0 and kc = 6.98.

For 0.92

0.95, we ﬁnd in our experiments a bi-
critical region where a complicated mixed mode surface
pattern appears. These kind of patterns can arise from
the nonlinear interactions of two or more linear instabili-
ties [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. They are usually obtained
by introducing frequency components in the forcing func-
tion with simple linear responses that interact in the hor-
izontal plane to produce new structures. In contrast, in
the current situation the changes in the tongue envelope
selects linear instabilities that are not directly connected
to the forcing components, and therefore the patterns
generated through this mechanism could potentially be
diﬀerent. Unfortunately, in our current experiment the
mixed surface patterns include complicated interactions
with the side walls due to the small size of the container.
Their proper analysis will therefore require a much larger
aspect ratio and is left for future work.

responding neutral stability curves (right) for p = 0.9 (top),
p = 1.0 (center), p = 1.1 (bottom), and the same parameters
and units as in Fig. 1. For small changes in f (ωt), the insta-
bility at onset (occurring at critical forcings indicated by the
dashed lines) switches from the ﬁrst subharmonic (SH) reso-
nance tongue to the second harmonic (H) one. Each asterisk

subharmonic and second harmonic tongues become si-
multaneously unstable at onset. The corresponding crit-
ical values are ΓSH
c = 3.87,
kH
c = 7.64, respectively. Finally, for p = 1.1 (bottom)
the second harmonic tongue becomes the instability at
onset, with ΓH
c = 7.59. We refer to it as
the second harmonic one since it oscillates with a main
frequency component at 2ω, and is therefore the second
harmonic tongue in order of growing k (the ﬁrst being
above the plotted Γ-range, between the two subharmonic
tongues displayed).
It is a non-trivial critical instabil-
ity, which cannot be easily explained by the mechanisms
described in the Introduction, because it does not corre-
spond to the ﬁrst harmonic or subharmonic responses to
any of the forcing frequency components (ω, 3ω and 5ω).
Instead, it is related to the second local minimum of the
envelope of the resonance tongues (see Fig. 1d).

Experimentally, we observe the transition between
these two linearly unstable regimes by using the same
fp(ωt) forcing function. Figure 3 shows images of the
surface patterns for p = 0.9 (left) and p = 1.1 (right).
As predicted by our numerical calculations, their char-
acteristic length scale changes dramatically, in spite of
the small variation in fp(ωt). For p = 0.9, we obtain a
pattern of large hexagons at a critical forcing Γc = 3.72g,
with a characteristic size of 3.5 cm which corresponds to
the critical wavenumber k = 1.77. When compared to

We are interested in exploring analytically the origin of
the relation observed in Section III between f (ωt) and the
envelope of Γc(k). To proceed, we will focus on systems
in the lubrication regime, where the ratio between the
2~v term of the Navier-Stokes equation is
∂t~v and the
small. This ratio is of order (l/δ)2, where l is the distance
that the ﬂuid motion penetrates the surface and δ is the
characteristic size of the boundary layer [1, 2, 33]. Since
l can be estimated by either 1/k (if kh
1) or h (if
kh
1), and δ is proportional to
ν/ω, it follows that
a system is in the lubrication regime if it consists of a
shallow enough ﬂuid layer with high enough viscosity and
a low enough oscillation frequency.

We use a simpliﬁed analytic description, introduced by
Cerda and Tirapegui in [1, 2] for ﬂuids under the lubri-
cation approximation, in which a damped Mathieu equa-
tion involving only the motion of the free ﬂuid surface is
obtained. This equation is found by ﬁrst deriving an ex-
act non-local (in time) relation for the linear evolution of
the surface, which is a formulation analogous to the one
developed in [34]. By imposing a short-memory to the
system due to its fast dissipation rate, the non-local de-
pendence is then neglected. The resulting Mathieu equa-
tion reads

Note that for some values of k and Γ it is also possible
to have E > V (x) or E < V (x) for all x, and therefore
no intersections between V (x) and E. In these situations
the matrix M cannot be computed and our current im-
plementation breaks down. However, the WKB method
is still valid and it has been shown in [1, 2] that these
cases never lead to instabilities. In our computation of
the neutral stability curves we can therefore assume that
there is at least one α and one β region per cycle.

C. Validity of the approximation.

This criterion implies that the approximation should be

to the condition required for the lubrication regime in
which we are focusing. Let us estimate δ and l for the
ﬂuid parameters used in Sections III and IV. For surface
waves oscillating at a frequency Ωk, the characteristic

size δ of the viscous boundary layer is of order
[1, 2, 33]. Since the response frequency of the dominant
surface waves is typically of the same order as the forc-

pared to the WKB approximation (bottom). The shape of

tics for p = 1. In both cases, the tongues that would become

the other hand, the distance l that the motion of the sur-
face penetrates the ﬂuid can be estimated by the smallest
value between h = 0.3 cm and 1/k. In the region of k con-
sidered (see Fig. 6), l is therefore larger than
0.1 cm.
Hence, for these parameters we have that l/δ is of order
1, which implies that the WKB method does not provide
a good approximation.

In order to be able to use a WKB analysis in our study,
we will consider in this section a shallower ﬂuid layer with
h = 0.1 cm and a lower oscillation frequency of 3.5 Hz,
while keeping all other parameters unchanged. For this
case, we have δ
h = 0.1. We
thus obtain (l/δ)4 < 10−2, which should imply a good
WKB approximation. However, this criterion alone does
not guarantee the accuracy of the resulting neutral sta-
bility curves. Indeed, for any forcing function there will
be regions of x where ω2/

the eﬀect of these regions over the full periodic Ψ(x) so-
lution cannot be easily estimated. This problem becomes
even harder if V (x) has a complicated shape because in
such cases no simple approximation can even provide the
number or size of these regions, which depend on k and
Γ. We will therefore validate our analysis by directly
comparing the WKB results to the numerical solutions
of the full Navier-Stokes linear stability problem.

tation of the WKB algorithm consists in ﬁnding the val-
ues Γc(k) for which the trace of M satisﬁes (34), where
M is obtained by multiplying the explicit expressions for
Mj given in (30). By comparing the top and bottom
panels, it is apparent that the WKB curves are almost
indistinguishable from the exact results in the p =

case, and that they provide a good approximation that
only slightly misses the shape of the instability tongues
for p = 1.

D. Analysis of the envelopes

Using the WKB approximation, we are now in a po-
sition to relate the shape of the forcing function to the
resonance tongue envelope. For any k and Γ, the stability
criterion (34) can be computed in terms of

Q(k, Γ) =

Tr(M )
2 cosh (2π¯γk/ω)

,

±

(36)

where Q(k, Γ) > 1 indicates an instability. If the forcing
function has only two extrema per cycle, there will always
be at the most one α and one β integration region, as
illustrated on Fig. 7 (top) for fp(ωt) with p =
2 (labeled
by an ‘a’, as in Figs. 1 and 6). In these cases we have
M = M1, and (36) becomes

−

Qa(k, Γ) =

cosh(αa + log 2) cos(βa)
cosh (2π¯γk/ω)

.

If we consider the function Qa(k) at constant Γ, the
cos(βa) factor will be responsible for oscillations that gen-
erate an unstable tongue at every excursion that reaches

p = −2 and a forcing strength Γ
(see Fig. 6). The regions
with Qa > 1 are unstable with harmonic (solid curve) or sub-
harmonic (dashed) responses. The dotted envelope is com-
puted by discarding the cos(βa) factor in equation (37).

Qa > 1. Figure 8 plots Qa at a ﬁxed forcing strength
Γ∗ = 18 g, indicated by the dashed horizontal line on
Fig. 6. The dotted lines trace the envelope of Qa, which
is readily obtained by discarding the cos(βa) factor from
(37). It exhibits a single maximum on the ﬁgure and for
all other values of Γ tested, implying that the envelope
of the resonance tongues must have a single minimum.

In contrast, forcing functions with multiple extrema
produce more complicated envelope structures. Figure
9 shows a plot of Q(k, Γ∗) for fp(ωt) with p = 1 (la-
beled here Qd since it corresponds to case ‘d’ in Figs. 1,
6 and 7). The oscillation amplitude presents two dis-
tinct zones of local maxima at k
7, which
are responsible for the two minima that the envelope of
the resonance tongues displays in Fig. 6. In general, it
is easy to see that any resonance tongue envelope with
multiple minima must be associated with Q(k) functions
(at ﬁxed Γ values) which have amplitude envelopes with
multiple maxima. We will now study how these compli-
cated amplitude envelopes arise by examining in detail
the analytical form of Qd.

Unfortunately, there appears to be no simple way to ex-
tract the properties of Γe(kh) without further specifying
κ1, κ2 and f (x). However, we have observed for all tested
cases that if f (x) has only two extrema per cycle, Γe(kh)
has only one minimum. While the validity of this state-
ment for all cases is a conjecture that would require a
proof which is beyond the scope of this paper, we con-
sider below two simple examples where analytic progress
can be made.

For a square forcing (where f (ωt) = 1 during half of
the period and f (ωt) =
1 during the other half), the
conjecture can be proved as follows. First, we ﬁnd the
solution of (47)

parameters, it can be evaluated numerically without loss
of generality. We obtain that it decreases monotonously
for growing y, intersecting the r = 0 axis at y∗

It has a more complicated structure than (51), which ren-
ders the use of the techniques developed for the square
forcing case impossible. In the current analysis we will
therefore content ourselves with scanning the parame-
ter space numerically to show that, for a wide range of
systems with triangular forcing, the envelope of the res-
onance tongues has only one minimum. In order to do
this, we ﬁrst note that the problem now depends on only
two nondimensional parameters: κ1 and κ2. We also note
that we can write the analytic solution of (53) and use
(48) and (50) to obtain a (very long) explicit algebraic ex-
pression for the envelope of the resonance tongues, which
we label Γtri(kh) but do not reproduce here because of its

to produce additional extrema even beyond their corre-
sponding domains. Furthermore, in various tested cases
with diﬀerent ﬂuid parameters and forcing functions we
have found no clear correlation between the changes in
the number of integration regions and the shape of the
neutral stability curves.

We now ﬁnd analytic expressions that describe the
envelope of the resonance tongues for any forcing func-
tion with only two extrema per cycle. The neutral sta-
bility criterion in these cases is equivalent to setting
Qa(k, Γ) = 1 in expression (37). By dropping the oscilla-
tory factor cos(βa) in (37) and using the high dissipation
of the lubrication regime to neglect the log 2 term (when
compared to αa which, for the parameters used in this
section, is evaluated as αa

that Γtri

ture also holds for triangular forcings.

Finally, for a sinusoidal forcing f (ωt)

cos(ωt) one
can only express Γk(χ) in terms of an integral equation
which cannot be explicitly solved. The work in [1, 2],
however, shows that Γsin
e (kh) again appears to have only
one minimum for any combination of parameters.

∝

The results presented above relate the shape of the
forcing function to that of the envelope of the resonance
tongues. In particular, they support the conjecture that
only a forcing with more than two extrema per cycle can
generate a tongue envelope that has more than one mini-
mum. A full proof of this conjecture would be of interest
not only as a mathematical result, but also as a guide for
engineering surface patterns. It would imply, for exam-
ple, that only forcing functions that have this characteris-
tic can display bicritical points involving non-contiguous
resonance tongues.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a new approach for studying the
eﬀect of the shape of the forcing function on the linear
surface wave instabilities. Through a numerical, exper-
imental and analytic investigation, we have established
a relation between the number of extrema in the forc-
ing function and the number of minima that can appear
in the envelope of the resonance tongues. This approach
does not rely on a multi-frequency description of the forc-
ing function. It therefore allows us to consider forcings
that cannot be deﬁned by the superposition of a few sinu-
soidal terms, but that can excite surface wave instabilities
in new ways that could lead to a greater control of the
surface patterns.

11

The analysis that we have carried out provides new in-
sights for understanding the eﬀects of the energy feeding
mechanism in pattern forming systems. Indeed, we use
the lubrication approximation to reduce the system to
one degree of freedom and then apply the WKB method,
which neglects the fast oscillations by integrating their
net eﬀect over the diﬀerent forcing segments. By doing
this, we achieve a description that is somehow similar to
the simple mechanical analogies (with balls, springs and
pendula) that are used in reduced dimensionality mod-
els of parametric resonance. In this context, it would be
interesting to try to relate the simpliﬁed dynamics that
the WKB calculations furnish for each wavenumber to
the forcing strength required to reach its corresponding
instability threshold. Furthermore, it may be possible
to follow a similar approach to study the eﬀects of the
forcing mechanism in other ﬂuid regimes or even in a dif-
ferent system, such as the granular Faraday experiments
where strongly non-sinusoidal forcings is the norm [35].
From an analytical perspective, various additional con-
nections between the forcing shape and the resonance
tongues could be obtained by developing the implicit re-
lations established here. We expect to be able to achieve
this by adequately choosing a reduced set of forcing func-
tions and using the right approximations. Obtaining
these additional connections could lead to a better un-
derstanding of the inverse problem, in which the forcing
function would be tailored to achieve a given instability.
From an experimental perspective, the lubrication
regime in which our analytic results are obtained has not
yet been widely explored. This is not due to any fun-
damental limitation but rather to technical diﬃculties,
mainly in achieving high enough accelerations at low fre-
quencies and having a large enough container for the sur-
face patterns to develop. However, given that we obtain
good analytical approximations in this regime, we hope
that new experiments will explore this regime. This, to-
gether with an extension of our analysis to consider non-
linear eﬀects, would allow an exploration of the patterns
that can be formed by the linear instabilities achieved
through the forcing function control.

The Numerical Solution of Nekrasov’s Equation in the
Boundary Layer near the Crest, for Waves near the
Maximum Height

by J.G. Byatt-Smith

Key Words:Integral equations, water waves.
Abstract: Nekrasov’s integral equation describing water waves of permanent
form, determines the angle φ (s) that the wave surface makes with the horizontal.
The independent variable s is a suitably scaled velocity potential, evaluated at
the free surface, with the origin corresponding to the crest of the wave. For all
waves, except for amplitudes near the maximum, φ (s) satisﬁes the inequality
φ (s)
|

It has been shown numerically and analytically, that as the wave amplitude
approaches its maximum, the maximum of
can exceed π/6 by about
1% near the crest. Numerical evidence suggested that this occurs in a small
boundary layer near the crest where

where F (t) = sn (Kt/π) and sn denotes the Jacobian elliptic function with
quarter periods K and iK ′. Equation (1.3) was ﬁrst formulated by Nekrasov [2]
to describe waves of constant periodic form moving with constant speed on the
surface of a non-viscous ﬂuid that is either of inﬁnite depth or on a horizontal
bottom, when the ﬂow is taken to be irrotational. The wave is assumed to be
symmetric about its crest and the equation is derived by conformally mapping
the the region of the ﬂow under one wavelength onto the unit disc cut along
the negative real axis. The generic point on the circumference of the disc is eis,
π < s < π, and s = 0 corresponds to the crest. As the circumference
with
is described in a clockwise direction from
π to π the horizontal coordinate
decreases by one wavelength. Then the function φµ is the angle that the wave
surface makes with the horizontal. With this choice of coordinate φµ(s) is
periodic with period 2π. For more details, see Nekrasov [2],[3] and [4] or Milne-
Thompson [5]. The wave is assumed to be symmetric about its crest. Thus
φµ (s) is an odd 2π periodic function of s with φµ (0) = 0. The solution is
unique provided the additional assumption, that the wave has only one peak
and one trough per period, is made. This is

(1.1). The boundary layer behavior of the solution of (1.3) was established
numerically by Chandler and Graham [6], who were able to obtain a solution

with a maximum value of φµ (s) ≏ 30
of oscillations about φµ = 30◦ for µ = 1018.

The numerical diﬃculty posed by the boundary layer behavior of the solu-
tions of (1.3) for large µ is over come, by Chandler and Graham [6], by using a
non uniform mesh for the discretisation of (1.3). This consists of three regions:
one to cope with the rapid variation of φµ (s) in the boundary layer, whose
thickness is of order µ−1, near the origin; a second to deal with the slower vari-
ation away from the origin and a third for the transitional layer in between.
For further references on the analytical properties of the solutions of (1.3) and
related numerical results, see Chandler and Graham [6] and McLeod [1].

The purpose of this paper is to solve (1.1) numerically and show that the
solution φ (s) oscillates about φ (s) = π/6 and obeys the formal asymptotic
result of McLeod [1] that can be written in the form

Equation (1.1) represents the solution in the boundary layer and can thus be
solved with a uniform mesh size. However (1.1) has an additional complication
compared with (1.3) in that the range of integration is inﬁnite and the decay of
the solution to its asymptotic limit is algebraic. This fact means that we require
careful consideration in order to obtain an accurate numerical representation of
the integral in (1.1).

2 The Numerical Method

Following Chandler and Graham [6] we solve the integral equation in the form
(1.1b). This formulation is better, for numerical purposes, because the integra-
tion by parts that is used to convert (1.1a) to (1.1b), removes the logarithmic
singularity, at t = s, which occurs in the kernel of (1.1a). Although the corre-
sponding kernel of (1.1b) has a pole, the singularity of the integrand is removable
since the multiple ψ (t)
Thus we write

ψ (s), has a simple zero at t = s.

We aim to set up a numerical approximation to the integral in terms of
2N , with N an
a discrete number of values φ (si), where si = ih, 0
integer, for suitable choices of h and N and a continuous set of values φ (s) for
s > 2N h. Any values of φ (s) for s < 0 required by the numerical approximation
are determined by the fact that φ (s) is an odd function of s. The numerical
representation of the integral requires two approaches. The ﬁrst is a ﬁnite
diﬀerence formulation of the integral over a predetermined ﬁnite range using
the discrete values of φ and the second is an estimation of the remainder using
an appropriate asymptotic estimate of the values of φ (s) for s > 2N h. The
that is used will be discussed
details of the asymptotic form of φ (s) as s
later.

So we choose an appropriate end point 2T where T is given by T = N h and
2T
0 K (t, s) dt using Simpson’s Rule,
we can approximate the integral I1 (s, φ) =
since the integrand is analytic. The choice of the end point 2T is some what
R
arbitrary. Eventually, see below, we will want to consider I1 (s, φ) for values
of s
T . We choose an end point mT , with m = 2 in this case, so that the
singularity of k (t, s) at t = s is far from the end point. The reason for this
is that the remainder integral, again see below, requires a diﬀerent evaluation
and it is advantageous to make sure that the singularity of k (s, t) is not close
to the range of t in the remainder integral. This will become clearer when the
evaluation of the remainder integral is discussed later.

Assuming that for large s, φ (s) is known in the form of an asymptotic ex-
pansion then truncation of this series, expansion of the integrand and a term
by term integration of the integrand will give a suitable analytical estimate

N I (s, φ) = N I1 (s, φ) + EI2 (s, φ) .

(2.3)

An alternative approach, assuming that the asymptotic form of φ (s), s > T ,
has been chosen, is to transform the inﬁnite range of the remainder integral into
a ﬁnite range, which can then be approximated numerically. For this purpose
it is more convenient to revert to the integral in the form (1.1a) so we write

0k4 (s, u) du with k4 (s, 0) = s/T. This integral can now be approximated using
Simpson’s rule with a suitably chosen step length. This approximation can be

Simpson’s rule gives an approximation which is of order h4, but this rule
requires an interval which consists of an even number of step lengths. However
the integrand contains the function ψ (t) which involves the determination of
t
0 sin φ (τ ) dτ at values t = ti = ih. To obtain a numerical approximation to this
which is the same order as Simpson’s rule for this integral we use an appropriate

modiﬁed trapisoidal rule.

We now wish to solve the approximation

φ (s) =

N I (s, φ) .

To do this we deﬁne an approximation φN (si) to the solution φ (s) at the discrete

that used to deﬁne φ (s) for s > 2N h we deﬁne the remaining discrete values of

[6] were able to prove that, when the quadrature method used to approximate
their integrals was the trapisoidal rule, convergence was guaranteed, although
for computational purposes they opted for a more accurate scheme for computa-
tional purposes. Their proof cannot be extended to the numerical approximation
used here even if the quadrature method is the trapisoidal rule because of the
inﬁnite range of integration. However we ﬁnd that, as in the cases looked at by
Chandler and Graham [6], the convergence rule is very quick.

3 The necessity of rescaling

}

We see from the deﬁnition of K (t, s) , (2.2a,b), and the fact that φ (0) is zero,
that N I (0, φ) = 0 provided the initial guess φ(0)
N (0) = 0. Then (2.7) gives
φm
N (0) = 0 for all m > 0. Thus eﬀectively we can work with the N variables
and corresponding N equations from (2.7). One of the aims
φN (si) , i = 1..N
{
is to verify the asymptotic result (1.6).
Initially we do not assume this and
report here that for a variety of sensible choices of the asymptotic form of φ (s)
we get rapid convergence to the solution of (2.8). Provided T is suﬃciently
large we can then numerically verify that (1.6) is the correct asymptotic result,
using the computed values of φ (s) for s
T . Having veriﬁed this numerically
to get the best accuracy we use (1.6) and ﬁnd that as well as providing a more
accurate numerical solution the convergence rate is also improved. The larger
T is, the less necessary it is to have a large number of terms from (1.6) and in
practice we use

Table 1 shows the comparison of the location and the values of φ (s) at successive
maximum and minimum values of φ and the comparison between this method at
that of Chandler and Graham [6]. Before discussing this comparison we use the
values of s at the successive turning points to illustrate the need for rescaling
the variable s. It will become clear that the computations done to obtain table
1 could not be achieved by the method outlined in paragraph 1. We see that
the s coordinate of each successive turning point increases by a factor of about
81, which is approximately the value of eπ/β . This is compatible with the set
of turning points obtained from (3.1). The last turning point in 0 < s < T is
1011. Typically we used h = 1/20 as a sensible choice of h
located at s = 2
compatible with having a large enough T to capture the asymptotic behavior of
1011
the solutions. However with this choice of h it is not feasible to take T = 2
1012 grid points. Typically using the scheme outlined in
as this would involve 4
paragraph 1 we chose T = 100 and this does not even get to the ﬁrst minimum
of φ (s). However we learn from this initial attempt at a numerical solution that
/π < 10−2 and varies very slowly. Thus for large
beyond s = 100, 6

4 The Numerical Results and Conclusions

All the numerical results given here are those produced by the numerical scheme
outlined in Section 2 and 3 using the rescaled problem. Table 1 shows the
comparison of the successive maxima and minima of φ (s) compared with those
computed for the full problem by Chandler and Graham [6]. The position
of these maxima and minima for the Chandler and Graham [6] computation,
has been calculated by scaling their coordinate, s, by µ compatible with the
boundary layer scaling used to derive (1.1) from (1.3). Thus s = sB−S = sCeG ×
µ. The number of decimal places given in table 1 for this numerical computation
are as accurate as the numerical calculation will allow. There are three forms
of error: the ﬁrst comes from the order of the numerical approximation to the
which gives rise to errors of order 10−8; the second is
solution which is O
due to machine accuracy which gives rise to an error of about 10−14 to 10−16;
thirdly there is the error that arises when predicting the position and size of
the maxima and minima of a function, from discrete data at given grid points,
assuming that the data is accurate. The ﬁgures quoted in table 1 do not take
into account the ﬁrst of two of these sources of error.

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

The comparison with the computations of Chandler and Graham [6] is very
good. The value at the ﬁrst maximum is the same to eight signiﬁcant ﬁgures
and the position the same to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures. The calculation of the
value at the maximum always being more accurate that its positions. The
values at the ﬁrst minimum are in similar agreement although Chandler and
Graham [6] only quote the position to four signiﬁcant ﬁgures and the value
10−3 below 30◦ so relatively the numbers do not
at the minimum is only 4
appear to be in such good agreement as the value at the ﬁrst maximum. The ﬁrst
noticeable divergence of the two computations appears at the second minimum
where the estimates of the positions diﬀer by about 4% although the values at
this minimum are in good agreement given that they are both of order 10−7
below 30◦. However the next maximum of Chandler and Graham [6] lies below
30◦ and it is apparent that at this value of s the eﬀects of the outer solution,
that is the decrease from the maximum on a slower scale, are just beginning
to show. Presumably at this value of µ the oscillations in the Chandler and
Graham [6] begin to cease at or around this value of s.

We wish to show that the solution behaves like (1.6) for large s. So for

comparison we write Θ (x) = φ (s), where x = β

A plot of the asymptotic expression (4.2) with these values of A and x0 and the
comparison with Ψ (x) is given in ﬁgure 1. The two graphs are indistinguishable
from each other over a surprisingly large range of values of x, from before the
ﬁrst zero to beyond the sixth zero. The graphs start to diverge after this point.
This is due to the fact that the exact solution of φ (s)
π/6, or equivalently
Ψ(x)/s, is so small in this range that round oﬀ error starts to become important
and eventually dominates the solution. This is more apparent in ﬁgures 2 and 3
which plot the diﬀerence between Ψ (x) and its asymptotic value. Figure 2 shows
this diﬀerence multiplied by 100 in the range of values of x where the diﬀerence
is less then one, while ﬁgure 3 shows 1000 times the diﬀerence. In both ﬁgures
we see that the diﬀerence increases rapidly after x ≏ 4. It is particularly visible
in ﬁgure 3 that this rapid rise has two diﬀerent components: a systematic rise
due to truncation error of the numerical scheme, which is of order 108 and a
random error on the scale of about 10−14, due to machine accuracy.

−

−

The last plot, ﬁgure 4, shows the diﬀerence between Ψ (x) and its asymp-
totic value multiplied by s. This clearly shows that the dominant feature is
one of a periodic function of period 1, compatible with a term proportional to
s−2 sin 2π (x

x1) that appears in (1.6).

To conclude we have presented a numerical scheme for the solution of (1.1),
written in the form (3.3) which allows a suﬃciently accurate numerical solution
over a range 0 6 s 6 1013, that we can verify the predicted asymptotic form
(1.6). The numerical calculation is limited by the two factors, truncation error
and machine accuracy. The numerical solutions can be made more accurate
by a higher order integration scheme but the range of integration is limited
because the diﬀerence between the solution and π/6 becomes the same order of
magnitude as the machine accuracy.

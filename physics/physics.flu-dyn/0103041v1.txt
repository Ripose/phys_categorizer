We investigate the eﬀects of geometrical micro-irregularities on the conversion eﬃciency of reactive
ﬂows in narrow channels of millimetric size. Three-dimensional simulations, based upon a Lattice-
Boltzmann-Lax-Wendroﬀ code, indicate that periodic micro-barriers may have an appreciable eﬀect
on the eﬀective reaction eﬃciency of the device. Once extrapolated to macroscopic scales, these
eﬀects can result in a sizeable increase of the overall reaction eﬃciency.

I. INTRODUCTION

The formulation of mathematical models and atten-
dant simulational tools for the description of complex
phenomena involving multiple scales in space and time
represents one of the outstanding frontiers of modern
applied physics/mathematics [1]. One such example of
complex multiscale phenomena is the dynamics of reac-
tive ﬂows, a subject of wide interdisciplinary concern in
theoretical and applied science, with several applications
in molecular engineering, material science, environmen-
tal and life sciences alike. The complexity of reactive ﬂow
dynamics is parametrized by three dimensionless quanti-
ties: the Reynolds number Re = U L/ν, the Damkohler
number Da = τh/τc, and the Peclet number P e = UH
D .
Here U , L and H denote the macroscopic ﬂow speed and
longitudinal/transversal lengths of the ﬂow, respectively,
ν the ﬂuid kinematic viscosity and D the pollutant molec-
ular diﬀusivity. The quantities τc and τh represent typical
timescales of chemical and hydrodynamic phenomena.

High Reynolds numbers are associated with turbu-
lence, namely loss of coherence of the ﬂow ﬁeld in both
space and time. High Damkohler numbers imply that
chemistry is much faster than hydrodynamics, so that re-
actions are always in chemical equilibrium and take place
in tiny regions (thin ﬂames, reaction pockets) of evolving
ﬂow conﬁgurations. The opposite regime (“well-stirred”
reactor) characterizes situations where the chemistry is
slow and always takes place at local mechanical equilib-
rium. Finally, high Peclet numbers imply that the trans-
ported species stick tightly to the ﬂuid carrier (in the
the tracer ﬁeld is “frozen-in” within ﬂow
limit P e
streamlines). Navigation across the three dimensional
Re
P e parameter space meets with an enormous
variety of chemico-physical behaviours, ranging from tur-
bulent combustion to hydrodynamic dispersion and oth-
ers [2]. The picture gets further complicated when ge-
ometry is taken into account, since boundary conditions
select the spatio-temporal structures sustaining the non-

linear interaction between the various ﬁelds. In this work
we shall deal with low-Reynolds, fast-reacting ﬂows with
heterogeneus catalysis. In particular we wish to gain in-
sights into the role of geometric micro-irregularities on
the eﬀective rate of absorption of tracer species (pollu-
tant hereafter) at catalytic boundaries. This is a theme
of broad interest, with applications in biology, physics,
chemistry, environmental sciences and more. It is there-
fore hoped that such kind of theoretical-computational
studies may promote a better understanding of the com-
plex phenomena behind these important applications [3].

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF REACTIVE
MICROFLOW DYNAMICS

We shall deal with an incompressible, isothermal ﬂow
with soluted species which are transported (advect and
diﬀuse) by the ﬂow and, upon reaching solid walls, they
undergo catalytic chemical reactions. The basic equa-
tions of ﬂuid motion are:

∂t(ρ~u) + div(ρ~u~u) =

∂tρ + div(ρ~u) = 0
~u)
P + div(µ

(1)

(2)

where ρ is the ﬂow density, ~u the ﬂow speed, P = ρT
the ﬂuid pressure, T the temperature and µ = ρν the
dynamic viscosity and ~u~u denotes the dyadic tensor
uaub, a, b = x, y, z.

Multispecies transport with chemical reactions is de-
scribed by a set of generalized continuity-diﬀusion equa-
tions:

∂tCs + div(Cs~us) = div[Ds∇

(Cs/ρ)] + ˙Ωs

(3)

where Cs denotes the mass density of the generic s-
th species, Ds its mass diﬀusivity and ˙Ωs is a surface-
chemical reaction term to be detailed shortly. In the fol-
lowing we indicate with the subscripts w and g the “wall”
(solid) and “gas” in contact with the wall respectively.

According to Fick’s law, the outgoing (bulk-to-wall) dif-
fusive mass ﬂux is given by:

A. Lattice Boltzmann equation

The simplest, and most popular form of lattice Boltz-
mann equation (Lattice BGK, for Bahtnagar, Gross,
Krook) [7], reads as follows:

~Jg→w =

Upon contact with solid walls, the transported species
react according to the following empirical rate equation
(the species index being removed for simplicity):

where the wall-ﬂux is taken in the simple linear form:

Γw = Kw(Cg

Cw)

−

(6)

where Kw is the wall to/from ﬂuid mass transfer rate
and Kc is the chemical reaction rate dictating species
consumption once a molecule is absorbed by the wall.
The subscripts w and g mean “wall” (solid) and “gas”
in a contact with the wall respectively. The above rate
equation serves as a dynamic boundary condition for the
species transport equations, so that each boundary cell
can be regarded as a microscopic chemical reactor sus-
tained by the mass inﬂow from the ﬂuid. In the absence
of surface chemical reactions the species concentration
in the solid wall would pile up in time, up to the point
where no outﬂow would occurr, a condition met when
Cg = Cw. Chemistry sets a time scale for this pile-up
and ﬁxes the steady-state mass exchange rate. At steady
state we obtain:

hence

Cw =

Kw
Kw + Kc

Cg

Γw =

Cg

(8)

where τw = 1/Kw and τc = 1/Kc. These expres-
sions show that ﬁnite-rate chemistry (Kc > 0) ensures
a non-zero steady wall outﬂux of pollutant. At steady
state, this mass ﬂow to the catalytic wall comes into bal-
ance with chemical reactions, thus ﬁxing a relation be-
tween the value of the wall-gradient concentration and
its normal-to-wall gradient:
|wk

where ∂⊥ means the normal to the perimeter compo-
nent of the gradient and p is the perimeter (volume/area)
of the reactive cell. This is a mixed Neumann-Dirichlet
boundary condition and identiﬁes the free-slip length of
the tracer as ls = D(τw + τc)/p.

tational invariance. Only a limited subclass of lattices
qualiﬁes. In the sequel, we shall refer to the nineteen-
speed lattice consisting of zero-speed, speed one c = 1
(nearest neighbor connection), and speed c = √2, (next-
nearest-neighbor connection). This makes a total of 19
discrete speeds, 6 neighbors, 12 nearest-neighbors and 1
rest particle (c = 0). The right hand side of (9) represents
the relaxation to a local equilibrium f e

the order of ω−1. This local equilibrium is usually taken

LBE was historically derived as the one-body kinetic
equation resulting from many-body Lattice Gas Au-
tomata, but it can mathematically obtained by standard
projection upon Hermite polynomials of the continuum
BGK equation and subsequent evaluation of the kinetic
moment by Gaussian quadrature [9]. It so happens that
the discrete speeds ~ci are nothing but the Gaussian knots,
showing that Gaussian integration achieves a sort of au-
tomatic “importance sampling” of velocity space which
allows to capture the complexities of hydrodynamic ﬂows
by means of only a handful of discrete speeds. The LBE
proves a very competitive tool for the numerical studies
of hydrodynamic ﬂows, ranging from complex ﬂows in
porous media to fully developed turbulence.

III. THE COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

The ﬂow ﬁeld is solved by a lattice Boltzmann method
[4–7] while the multispecies transport and chemical re-
actions are handled with a variant of the Lax-Wendroﬀ
method [8]. A few details are given in the following.

Since species transport equation is linear in the species
concentration, we can solve it on a simple 6-neighbors
cubic lattice. Within this approach, each species is as-
sociated with a species density Cs, which splits into six
separate contributions along the lattice links.

dimensions reads as follows (in units of ∆t = 1)):

C. Multiscale considerations

The simulation of a reactive ﬂow system is to all eﬀects
a multi-physics problem involving four distinct physical
processes:

1. Fluid Motion (F)

2. Species Transport (T)

3. Fluid-Wall interaction (W)

4. Wall Chemical Reactions (C)

Each of these processes is characterized by its own
timescale which may diﬀer considerably from process to
process depending on the local thermodynamic condi-
tions. Loosely speaking, we think of F and T as to
macroscopic phenomena, and W and C as of microscopic
ones. The relevant ﬂuid scales are the advective and
momentum-diﬀusive time, and the mass-diﬀusion time
of the species respectively:

where L, H are the length and height of the ﬂuid domain.
The relevant time scales for species dynamics are:

τA = L/U,
τν = H 2/ν,

τD = H 2/D,
τw = K −1

τc = K −1

To acknowledge the multiscale nature in time of the
problem, a subcycled time-stepper is adopted. This is
organized as follows. The code ticks with the hopping
time of the ﬂuid populations from a lattice site to its
neighbors dt = dx/c = 1. Under all circumstances dt
is much smaller than both diﬀusive and advective ﬂuid
scales in order to provide a faithful description of ﬂuid
ﬂow. Whenever dt exceeds the chemical time-scales (high
Damkohler regime), fractional time-stepping, i.e. subcy-
cling of the microscopic mechanisms, namely chemical-
wall transfer is performed. This means that the chemi-
cal and wall transfer operators are performed dt/τc,dt/τw
times respectively at each ﬂuid cycle. As it will be ap-
preciated shortly, since the ﬂow solver ticks at the sound
speed, the present microﬂow simulations proceed in very
short time steps, of the order of tens of nanoseconds. This
means that they can be in principle coupled to meso-
scopic methods, such as kinetic Monte Carlo, aﬀording
a more realistic description of the ﬂuid-wall interactions.
In particular, a Kinetic Monte Carlo update of a sin-
gle boundary cell could proceed in parallel with a cor-
responding hydrodynamic treatment of the entire pile of
ﬂuid cells on top of the wall. The ﬂip side of the medal
is that in order to draw quantitative conclusions at the
scale of the macroscopic devices a two-three decade ex-
trapolation is required. This commands a robust scaling
argument.

IV. CATALYTIC EFFICIENCY: QUALITATIVE
ANALYSIS

Ideally, we would like to synthetize a universal func-
tional dependence of the catalytic eﬃciency as a function
of the relevant dimensionless numbers and geometrical
design parameters:

η = f (Re, Da, P e; ¯g).

(20)

where ¯g represents a vector of geometric parameters char-
acterizing the boundary shape. The question is to as-
sess the sensitivity of η to ¯g and possibly ﬁnd an op-
timal solution (maximum η) within the given parame-
ter space. Mathematically, this is a complex non-linear
functional optimization problem for the geometrical pa-
rameters. We ﬁnd it convenient to start from a simple-
and yet representative-baseline geometry as an “unper-
turbed” zero order approximation, which is easily acces-
sible either analytically or numerically. Perturbations to

this baseline situation can then be parametrized as “topo-
logical excitations” on top of the geometrical “ground
state”. In the present study, the unperturbed geometry
is a straight channel of size L along the ﬂow direction and
H
H across it. Perturbations are then deﬁned as micro-
corrugations in the bottom wall of the form z = h(x, y),
0 being the smooth-wall unperturbed case. In this

work, the perturbation is taken in the form of delta-like
protrusions (barriers) h(x, y, z) =

and the integral runs over the entire absorbing surface S
The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize
Γ at a given Φin. As it is apparent from the above ex-
pressions, this means maximizing complex conﬁguration-
dependent quantities, such as the wall distribution of the
pollutant and its normal-to-wall gradient. For future pur-
poses, we ﬁnd it convenient to recast the catalytic eﬃ-
T , where T is the channell transmittance
ciency as η = 1

−

T

Φout/Φin

≡

From a microscopic viewpoint, T can be regarded as
the probability for a tracer molecule injected at the inlet
to exit the channel without being absorbed by the wall
and consequently it ﬁxes the escape rate from the chemi-
cal trap. Roughly speaking, in the limit of fast-chemistry,
this is controlled by the ratio of advection to diﬀusion
timescales. More precisely, the escape rate is high if the
cross-channel distance walked by a tracer molecule in a
transit time τA is much smaller than the channel cross-
length H/2. Mathematically: DτA ≪

H 2/4, which is:

P e

4 L/H

≫

(26)

The above inequality (in reverse) shows that in order
to achieve high conversion eﬃciencies, the longitudinal
aspect ratio L/H of the device has to scale linearly with
the Peclet number.

A. The role of micro-irregularities

We now discuss the main qualitative eﬀect of geomet-
rical roughness on the above picture from a microscopic
point of view, i.e. trying to resolve ﬂow features at the
same scale of the micro-irregularity.

In the ﬁrst place, geometric irregularities provide a po-
tential enhancement of reactivity via the sheer increase
of the surface/volume ratio. Of course, how much of this
potential is actually realized depends on the resulting
ﬂow conﬁguration.

≃

Here, the ﬂuid plays a two-faced role. First, geomet-
rical restrictions lead to local ﬂuid acceleration, hence
less time for the pollutant molecules to migrate from
the bulk to the wall before being convected away by
the mainstream ﬂow. This eﬀect, usually negligible for
macroscopic ﬂows, may become appreciable for micro-
ﬂows with h/H
0.1 (like in actual catalytic convert-
ers), h being the typical geometrical micro-scale of the
wall corrugations. Moreover, obstacles shield away part
of the active surface (wake of the obstacle) where the ﬂuid
circulates at much reduced rates (stagnation) so that less
pollutant is fed into the active surface. The size of the
shielded region is proportional to the Reynolds number
of the ﬂow. On the other hand, if by some mechanism the
ﬂow proves capable of feeding the shielded region, then
eﬃcient absorption is restored simply because the pollu-
tant is conﬁned by recirculating patterns and has almost
inﬁnite time to react without being convected away. The
ordinary mechanism to feed the wall is molecular diﬀu-
sion/dispersion, which is usually rather slow as compared
to advection. More eﬃcient is the case where the ﬂow de-
velops local micro-turbulence which may increase bulk-
to-wall diﬀusive transport via enhanced density gradients
and attendant density jumps Cg

Cw:

where w′ is the normal-to-wall microturbulent velocity

unity:

where h is the typical geometrical micro-scale. Given
this complex competition of eﬃciency-promoting and

better eﬃciency is a non-trivial task.

Replacing this ansatz into the steady-state version of the

limit, L

less signiﬁcant.

C. Corrugated channel: Analytical estimates

Having discussed tha baseline geometry, we now turn
to the case of a “perturbed” geometry. Let us begin by
considering a single barrier of height h. The reference
situation is a smooth channel at high Damkohler with
e−L/l. We seek perturbative corrections in the
η0 = 1
smallness parameter g
h/H, the coupling-strength to
geometrical perturbations. The unperturbed wall-ﬂux is

where ¯U is the average ﬂow speed

C(x, y, z)

(31)

Xy,z

Note that the proﬁle along the spanwise coordinate y
remains almost ﬂat because we stipulate that only the
top and bottom walls host catalytic reactions.

To determine the cross-ﬂow absorption length l⊥ we
impose that along all ﬂuid cells in a contact with the
wall, the diﬀusive ﬂux is exactly equal to ﬂuid-to-wall
outﬂow, namely:

where

where τ the eﬀective absorption/reaction time scale,

and Nz = H 2 is the number of cells (dx = 1 in the code)
in a cross-section x = const. of the channel. Therefore
the factor 2/Nz is the fraction of reactive cells along any
given cross-section x = const. of the channel.

The form factor Cg/C is readily obtained by the third

of Eq. (29) which yields

Combining this equation with Eq. (32) we obtain a non-
linear algebraic equation for l⊥:

The above expression shows a perturbative (quadratic)

perturbative dependence on h, so that departures from
this quadratic scaling should not come as a surprise.

of perpendicular barriers of height h a distance s apart
on the bottom wall (see Fig. 1 for a rapid sketch).

×

The single-barrier set up corresponds to the limit
s = 0. The ﬂuid ﬂow carries a passive pollutant, say
an exhaust gas ﬂow, which is absorbed at the channel
walls where it disappears due to heterogeneus catalysis.
The ﬂow is forced with a constant volumetric force which
mimics the eﬀects of a pressure gradient. The exhaust
gas is continuously injected at the inlet, x = 0, with a
ﬂat proﬁle across the channel and, upon diﬀusing across
the ﬂow, it reaches solid walls where it gets trapped and
subsequently reacts according to a ﬁrst order catalytic
reaction:

C(x, y, z) = 0,

elsewhere

ρ(x, y, z) = 1
u(x, y, z) = U0, v(x, y, z) = w(x, y, z) = 0

The pollutant is continuously injected at the inlet and
released at the open outlet, while ﬂow periodicity is im-
posed at the inlet/outlet boundaries. On the upper and
lower walls, the ﬂow speed is forced to vanish, whereas

As per the interbarrier separation, we consider the fol-
lowing values: h/H = 0.2 and s/L = 0, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and
h/H = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 for s/L = 0. For the sake of com-
parison, the case of a smooth wall (s = 0, h = 0) is also
included.

The typical simulation time-span is t = 32000 time-
steps, namely about 1.6 milliseconds in physical time,
corresponding to two mass diﬀusion times across the
channel. The physico-chemical parameters given above
are not intended to match any speciﬁc experimental con-
dition, but rather to develop a generic intuition for the
interplay of the various processes in action under the fast
chemistry assumption.

A. Single barrier: eﬀects of barrier heigth

≃

We consider a single barrier of height h placed in the
middle of the bottom wall at x = L/2, z = 0. With
the above parameters we may estimate the reference eﬃ-
ciency for the case of smooth channel ﬂow. With ¯U
0.1,
and τ = 20, we obtain l

200, hence η0

0.5.

≃

A typical two-dimensional cut of the ﬂow pattern and
pollutant spatial distribution in the section y = H/2 is
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, which refer to the case h = 8, s =
0 (h/H = 0.1, s/L = 0.0). An extended (if feeble) recir-
culation pattern is well visible past the barrier. Also, en-
hanced concentration gradients in correspondence of the
tip of the barrier is easily recognized from Fig. 3. A more
quantitative information is conveyed by Fig. 4, where the
integrated longitudinal concentration of the pollutant:

≃

C(x) =

C(x, y, z)

(49)

Xy,z

is presented for the cases h = 0, 2, 4, 8 (always with
s = 0). The main highlight is a substantial reduction
of the pollutant concentration with increasing barrier
height. This is qualitatively very plausible since the bulk
ﬂow is richer in pollutant and consequently the tip of the
barrier “eats up” more pollutant than the lower region.
In order to gain a semi-quantitative estimate of the chem-
ical eﬃciency, we measure the the pollutant longitudinal
mass ﬂow:

Φ(x) =

[Cu](x, y, z)

(50)

Xy,z

The values at x = 1 and x = L deﬁne the eﬃciency ac-
cording to Eq. (21) (to minimize ﬁnite-size eﬀects actual
measurements are taken at x = 2 and x = 70).

The corresponding results are shown in Table I, where
subscript A refers to the analytical expression (41) with
a = 1. These results are in a reasonable agreement with
the analytical estimate Eq. (41) taken at a = 1 (same
absorption as the smooth channel). However, for h = 8
the assumption a = 1 overestimates the actual eﬃciency,
indicating that the shielded region absorbs signiﬁcantly
less pollutant than in the smooth-channel scenario. In-
deed, inspection of the transversal concentration proﬁles
(Fig. 5) along the chord x = 3L/4, y = H/2 reveals a
neat depletion of the pollutant in the wake region. This
is the shielding eﬀect of the barrier.

Besides this eﬃciency-degrading eﬀect, the barrier
also promotes a potentially beneﬁcial ﬂow recirculation,
which is well visible in Figs. 6 and 7. Figure 6 shows
the time evolution of the streamwise velocity u(z) in the
mid-line x = 3L/4, y = H/2. It clearly reveals that recir-
culating backﬂow only sets in for h = 8, and also shows
that the velocity proﬁle gets very close to steady state.
A blow-up of the recirculating pattern in the near-wall
back-barrier region is shown in Fig. 7. However these
recirculation eﬀects are feeble (the intensity of the recir-
culating ﬂow is less than ten percent of the bulk ﬂow)
and depletion remains the dominant mechanism. In fact
for h = 8 the measured local Peclet number is of the or-
der 0.01
8/0.1 = 0.8, seemingly too small to promote
appreciable micro-turbulent eﬀects. In passing, it should
be noticed that raising the barrier height has an appre-
ciable impact on the bulk ﬂow as well, which displays
some twenty percent reduction due to mechanical losses
on the barrier.

·

Finally, we observe that the measured eﬃciency is
smaller than the theoretical ηc for smoth channel. This
is due to the fact that the ﬂow Φ(x = 2) is signiﬁcantly
enhanced by the imposed inlet ﬂat proﬁle C(z) = 1 at
x = 1 (as well visible in Fig. 4). Leaving aside the initial
portion of the channel, our numerical data are pretty well
ﬁtted by an exponential with absorption length l = 160,
in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical estimate
l

200 obtained by solving Eqs. (30) and (32).

B. Eﬀects of barrier separation

Next we examine the eﬀect of interbarrier separation.
To this purpose, three separations s = 10, 20, 40 sym-
metric around x0 = L/2 are been considered. A typical
two-barrier ﬂow pattern with s = 40 is shown in Fig. 8.
From this picture we see that even with the largest sepa-
ration s = 40, the second barrier is still marginally in the
wake of the ﬁrst one. As a result, we expect it to suﬀer
seriously from the aforementioned depletion eﬀected pro-
duced by the ﬁrst barrier. This expectation is indeed con-
ﬁrmed by the results reported in Table II. These results
show that, at least on the microscopic scale, the presence
of a second barrier does not seem to make any signiﬁcant
diﬀerence, regardless of its separation from the ﬁrst one.
As anticipated, the most intuitive explanation is again
shadowing: the ﬁrst barrier gets much more “food” than
the second one, which is left with much less pollutant due
to the depletion eﬀect induced by the ﬁrst one. Inspec-
tion of the longitudinal pollutant concentration (Fig. 9)
clearly shows that the ﬁrst barrier, regardless of its lo-
cation, “eats up” most of the pollutant (deﬁcit with re-
spect to the upper-lying smooth-channel curve is almost
unchanged on top of the second barrier). Of course, this
destructive interference is expected to go away for “well-
separated” barriers with s
Indeed, the ultimate
≫
goal of such investigations should be to devise geomet-
rical set-ups leading to constructive interference. This
would require much larger and longer simulations which
are beyond the scope of the present work.

w.

C. Eﬀects of barrier height on a longer timescale

Since the previous simulations only cover a fraction of
the global momentum diﬀusion time, one may wonder
how would the picture change by going to longer time
scales of the order of H 2/ν. Longer single-barrier simula-
tions, with t = 160, 000, up to 10 diﬀusion times, namely
about 15 milliseconds, provide the results exposed in Ta-
ble III.

We observe that the quantitative change is very minor,
just a small eﬃciency reduction due to a slightly higher
ﬂow speed. Indeed, the spatial distribution of the pollu-
tant does not show any signiﬁcant changes as compared
to the shorter simulations. and a similar conclusion ap-
plies to the ﬂow pattern (see Figs. 10 and 11). This is
because in a Poiseuille ﬂow, the ﬂuid gets quickly to, say,
90 percent of its total bulk speed (and even quicker to
its near-wall steady conﬁguration), while it takes much
longer to attain the remaining ten percent. Since it is
the near-wall ﬂow conﬁguration which matters mostly in
terms of a semi-quantitative estimate of the chemical eﬃ-
ciency, we may conclude that the simulation span can be
contained to within a fraction of the global momentum
equilibration time.

It is important to realize that even tiny improvements
on the microscopic scale can result in pretty sizeable cu-
mulative eﬀects on the macroscopic scale of the real de-
vices, say 10 centimeters. Assuming for a while the ef-
ﬁciency of an array of N serial micro-channels can be
estimated simply as

ηN = 1

T N ,

(51)

−
it is readily recognized that even low single-channel ef-
ﬁciencies can result in signiﬁcant eﬃciencies of macro-
scopic devices with N = 10
In
particular, single-channel transmittances as high as 90
percent can lead to appreciable macroscopic eﬃciencies,
around 60 percent, when just ten such micro-channels are
linked-up together. Such a sensitive dependence implies
that extrapolation to the macroscopic scales, even when
successfull in matching experimental data [11,12], must
be taken cautiously. In fact, the above expression (51)
represents of course a rather bold upscaling assumption.
As a partial supporting argument, we note that unless the
geometry itself is made self-aﬃne (fractal walls [10]), or
the ﬂow develops its own intrinsic scaling structure (fully
developed turbulence), the basic phenomena should re-
main controlled by a single scale l, independent of the
device size L. Since both instances can be excluded for
the present work, extrapolation to macroscopic scales is
indeed conceivable. Nonetheless, it is clear a tight sin-
ergy between computer simulation and adequate analyt-
ical scaling theories is in great demand to make sensible
predictions at the macroscopic scale.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

This work presents a very preliminary exploratory
study of the complex hydro-chemical phenomena which
control the eﬀective reactivity of catalytic devices of mil-
limetric size. Although the simulations generally conﬁrm
qualitative expectations on the overall dependence on the
major physical parameters, they also highlight the exis-
tence of non-perturbative eﬀects, such as the onset of
micro-vorticity in the wake of geometrical obstrusions,
which are hardly amenable to analytical treatment. It is
hoped that the ﬂexibility of the present computer tool, as
combined with semi-analytical theories, can be of signiﬁ-
cant help in developing semi-quantitative intuition about
the subtle and fascinating interplay between geometry,
chemistry, diﬀusion and hydrodynamics in the design of
chemical traps, catalytic converters and other related de-
vices.

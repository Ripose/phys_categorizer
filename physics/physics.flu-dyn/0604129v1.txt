Classically, large-scale forced turbulence is characterized by a transfer of energy from large to
small scales via nonlinear interactions. We have investigated the changes in this energy transfer
process in broad-band forced turbulence where an additional perturbation of ﬂow at smaller scales
is introduced. The modulation of the energy dynamics via the introduction of forcing at smaller
scales occurs not only in the forced region but also in a broad range of length-scales outside the
forced bands due to non-local triad interactions. Broad-band forcing changes the energy distribution
and energy transfer function in a characteristic manner leading to a signiﬁcant modulation of the
turbulence. We studied the changes in this transfer of energy when changing the strength and
location of the small-scale forcing support. The energy content in the larger scales was observed to
decrease, while the energy transport power for scales in between the large and small scale forcing
regions was enhanced. This was investigated further in terms of the detailed transfer function
between the triad contributions and observing the long-time statistics of the ﬂow. The energy is
transferred toward smaller scales not only by wavenumbers of similar size as in the case of large-scale
forced turbulence, but by a much wider extent of scales that can be externally controlled.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of kinetic energy plays a central role
in turbulent ﬂows. The nonlinear term in the Navier–
Stokes equations is responsible for the transfer of en-
ergy between any three wavevectors that form a triad
in spectral space [1]. Along with the viscous and forc-
ing terms this controls the production, transfer and dis-
sipation of energy in the system. The triadic interac-
tions have been studied for decaying and forced turbu-
lence by many authors (for a review see [2]). Through-
out the years various types of large-scale forcing meth-
ods [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] have been proposed to
sustain quasi-stationarity in numerical turbulence as an
idealized form of turbulent ﬂow. The aim of such nu-
merical experiments was to investigate the basic concept
of the Kolmogorov (K41) theory [12] that proposes an
inertial range in the kinetic energy spectrum and local
transfer of energy within this range. The turbulent ki-
netic energy is on average transferred locally from larger
to neighboring smaller scales.

The purpose of this paper is to numerically investi-

partment of Applied Physics, P.O. Box 513, 5300 MB Eindhoven,

gate the processes associated with the ﬂow of energy in
a turbulent ﬂow. Speciﬁcally, we consider modulated tur-
bulence in which the modiﬁcations involve the supple-
mentary forcing in a wide range of modes located in an
inertial range of the ﬂow. In the literature, mainly turbu-
lence with forcing restricted to the large scales has been
examined in detail [2]. The small scale behavior was
found to be energetically quite insensitive to the type of
forcing and at suﬃciently high Reynolds numbers a well-
developed inertial range was observed [13]. Against this
background, we extend the use of forcing methods and
investigate their application directly in the inertial range,
thereby focusing particularly on the competition between
transfer and forcing. We quantify the dominant alter-
ations due to the broad-band forcing in terms of changes
in the energy cascading processes. We pay attention to
the energy transfer function and consider changes that
arise in the contributions from ‘local’, ‘non-local’ and
‘distant’ triadic interactions. Compared to traditional
large-scale forced turbulence, we observe a strengthening
of the contributions of non-local interactions, leading to
a modiﬁcation of the inertial range spectrum.

High-resolution direct numerical simulations of tur-
bulence that measure the inﬂuence of individual terms
in the Navier–Stokes equations on the triadic interac-
tions have been reported [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. It
was found that the energetically dominant triadic inter-
actions involve sets of three modes in which the mag-
nitude of the wavevector of one of the modes diﬀers

considerably from the other two. This suggest that
statistics of smaller scales may be aﬀected by larger
scales. These dominant processes are not in contradic-
tion with the Kolmogorov theory because the energy is
mainly exchanged between the two modes of quite similar
wavevector-size [19]. Only a small net energy transfer to-
ward larger wavenumbers arises that involves a detailed
cancellation between many individual triad transfers [20].
The spectral space dynamics is characterized by a multi-
tude of separate transfer-processes among various modes.
These contributions can be collected in pairs with op-
posite sign and almost the same magnitude.
In total,
this leads to a large number of ‘near-cancellations’ and
hence only a comparably small net eﬀect remains that
constitutes the well-known ‘downward cascading’ toward
higher wavenumbers in spectral space. This was con-
ﬁrmed with the use of helical mode decomposition in [20].
The dynamics of actual turbulent ﬂows seen in nature
is usually characterized by an enormous number of inter-
acting scales, often perturbed by geometrically complex
boundaries and inﬂuenced by additional forces such as ro-
tation and buoyancy. This can lead to inhomogeneity and
anisotropy, which are not covered directly in the classical
view of the Kolmogorov energy cascade and may express
themselves in non-local interactions of various particular
scales of motion. The complexity of such systems mo-
tivated us to study in more detail forcing methods that
simultaneously perturb a prescribed range of scales [21].
Such ‘broad-band’ agitation of various scales of motion is
observed experimentally in turbulent drag reduction by
ﬁbre suspension [22, 23], ﬂows through porous media [24]
and over tree canopies [25]. In these cases the energy is
transferred abruptly to small scales when the ﬂow reaches
an obstruction. Various other types of ﬂows also exhibit
turbulent motions that coexist at diﬀerent scales [26].

To explore the possibilities of a broader application
of forcing methods in turbulence modeling and concur-
rently examine the energy dynamics in ﬂows that do not
directly follow the classical Kolmogorov −5/3 scaling we
employ numerical simulations of broad-band forced tur-
bulence. The forcing studied in this paper represents a
continual addition/removal of energy from a broad range
of scales in the system, thereby providing the possibility
of altering the characteristic −5/3 slope in the kinetic
energy spectrum as predicted by the K41 theory. Specif-
ically, as indicated in Fig. 1, we apply the forcing to two
regions. The large-scale forcing k ≤ k0 classically agi-
tates the largest scales in a ﬂow while the additional band
k1 < k ≤ k2 is located in a region of the inertial regime,
to allow a direct competition with the nonlinear transfer
term. For inertial-range scales broad-band forcing intro-
duces explicit energy injection next to the transfer-term.
We varied the spectral support and strength of the high-k
band to investigate the modulation of the turbulence that
develops. This distinguishes it from the classical forcing
of large scales only.

In this paper we compute changes in the energy dis-
tribution associated with the broad-band forcing and ob-

serve a characteristic alteration in the spectral energy
transfer compared to the classical Kolmogorov cascad-
ing. This alteration expresses itself by additional local
minima and maxima in the transfer function. It is well
known that in cases with large-scale forcing only, negative
values are found for the transfer at the smallest wavenum-
bers indicating the energy injection at these scales. The
positive values for the transfer that arise for all other
wavenumbers indicates the energy cascading process to
smaller scales. In our case of broad-band forcing in the
inertial range, additional negative regions appear in the
transfer function. These coincide with the additional lo-
cal injection of energy. Such a negative region is bordered
by nearby additional maxima in the transfer. These char-
acterize the associated increased energy transfer to scales
just larger or just smaller than the broad-band forced re-
gion.

Forcing applied to diﬀerent spatial scales simultane-
ously allows a non-local modulation of the energy distri-
bution compared to the reference Kolmogorov case. To
quantify the alterations in the energy transfer we use a
decomposition of the velocity ﬁeld closely following [16]
and investigate the magnitude of the contributions from
various spatial scales to the overall energy transfer.

The main ﬁnding of this study pertains to the role of
broad-band inertial range forcing in modifying the nat-
ural energy cascading process. This is understood ex-
plicitly in terms of changes in the detailed non-local en-
ergy transfer. In addition, we illustrate and quantify the
mechanism of enhancement of the total energy transfer
to smaller scales arising from broad-band forcing and the
depletion of the energy-content in the large scales. Agi-
tation of certain high wavenumbers can aﬀect well sepa-
rated low wavenumber components in a ﬂow. These ﬁnd-
ings may be relevant for problems that involve the control
of turbulent ﬂow in complex geometries in which vari-
ous scales of motions are simultaneously agitated, e.g.,

in compact heat-exchangers [24]. Further applications
of such broad-band forcing may be connected with the
observed modulations of transport properties in physical
space leading to an enhanced scalar dispersion rate [21].
The organization of this paper is as follows. The math-
ematical formulation of the problem is given in Sec. II
where the computational method and the energy transfer
terms are also described. The energy spectra of broad-
band forced turbulence and the modulation of the energy
transfer are investigated in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we present
a more detailed view of the energy transfer processes by
computing partitioned energy transfer function over var-
ious spatial scales. The paper closes with a summary in
Sec. V.

II. COMPUTATIONAL FLOW MODEL

An overview of the computational model is given in
this section (II A). The forcing method in the broad-band
context is described subsequently (II B). In addition, the
energy transfer between diﬀerent triads is partitioned in
a number of contributions (II C) that will be studied nu-
merically in Sec. IV. Finally, simulation details are given
(II D).

A. Equations of motion

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in spec-

tral (Fourier) representation can be written as

∂t + νk2
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

uα(k, t) = Ψα(k, t) + Fα(k, t),

(1)

where uα(k, t) is the velocity ﬁeld coeﬃcient at wavevec-
tor k (k = |k|) and time t [1]. The non-dimensional
kinematic viscosity ν is the inverse of the computational
Reynolds number (Re = 1/ν). The nonlinear term reads

we ﬁnd

Ψα(k, t) = Mαβγ

uβ(p, t)uγ(q, t),

(2)

Xp+q=k

and the forcing term Fα(k, t) is speciﬁed in section II B.
The tensor Mαβγ in (2) accounts for the pressure and
incompressibility eﬀects:

energy equation

(8)

The spectral energy density is denoted by E(k, t) =

2 u∗
α(k, t)uα(k, t). The rate of energy exchanged at
wavevector k with all other modes in the system is char-
acterized by the energy transfer function

T (k, t) = u∗

α(k, t)Ψα(k, t).

The rate of energy provided by the forcing term is

TF (k, t) = u∗

α(k, t)Fα(k, t),

and the energy dissipation rate present in (5) reads

ε(k, t) = 2νk2E(k, t).

The three terms T (k, t), TF (k, t) and ε(k, t) represent
the energy dynamics in the system that each typically
act in distinct wavenumber regions. The forcing term
TF (k, t) is non-zero in the forced modes only. In this pa-
per the collection of forced modes will always contain a
low wavenumber band corresponding to large-scale forc-
ing of the ﬂow. In addition, higher wavenumber contri-
butions will be included in TF (k, t). In contrast, the en-
ergy dissipation rate ε(k, t) is deﬁned in the entire spec-
tral space, but it is dynamically important primarily for
the high wavenumber range. Finally, the transfer term
T (k, t) is basic to the development of an energy cascade
and is a dominant contribution for wavenumbers in an
inertial range [1].

nected with its viscous dissipation and the total eﬀect of

the forced region. This keeps the whole system in a quasi-

stationary state. Normally, the forced region is restricted
to the largest scales in a ﬂow represented by the smallest
wavenumbers [5, 10]. The energy introduced in the large
scales is transferred to smaller scales and dissipated pri-
marily in very localized ﬂow-features of viscous length-
scales. By the introduction of an additional source of
energy in the inertial range we will study the perturba-
tion of the energy cascading process by the forcing. The
forcing method adopted here will be presented next.

Conventionally, the turbulent cascade develops as a sta-
tistical equilibrium is reached, characterized by the bal-
ance between the input of kinetic energy through the
forcing and its removal through viscous dissipation. In
literature ([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]), we may distinguish
several numerical approaches to forced turbulence that
all refer to the agitation of the largest scales of motion.
Here, we modify such classical forcing procedures by al-
lowing for the simultaneous agitation of a broader range
of intermediate-k modes as depicted in Fig. 1.

We study two ranges of forcing: the classical large-
scale forcing (k ≤ k0) and small-scale forcing localized in
the spectral region where the transfer of energy T (k, t)
is important (k1 < k ≤ k2). By narrowing or widening
the width of the forced bands, along with a change in
their location in spectral space we can control several as-
pects of the energy-dynamics. The strength of forcing is
controlled by the amount of energy introduced to various
regions in spectral space.

We expect the small-scale forcing band to inﬂuence
the inter-scale energy transfer process not only between
scales of similar size but at a wider spectrum of scales.
This may be understood globally as follows. The process
of energy cascading is mainly interpreted via the result-
ing local transfer of energy in spectral space [19]. How-
ever, this total energy transfer results from many non-
local contributions and these may be directly altered by
the additional small-scale forcing. Correspondingly an
inﬂuence on the overall energy cascading process may
occur over an extended wavenumber range. We quantify
this eﬀect by evaluating the nonlinear interactions among
the various modes while they are being perturbed by the
broad-band forcing.

In this paper we adopt the recently proposed fractal
forcing [27], which involves a power-law dependence of
Fα on the wavenumber:

C. Energy transfer

A detailed investigation of the energy transfer in large-
scale forced turbulence [19] shows that the dominant tri-
adic interactions occur between wavevectors of quite dif-
ferent lengths. Hence, large-scale forcing may be directly
involved in the dynamics of much smaller scales [28]. The
interactions are roughly classiﬁed as “local” when the
sizes of all wavevectors in a triad are similar, “non-local”
when the scale separation is about a factor 10-15 and
“distant” when the separation is much larger [29]. It was
shown that the transfer of energy reaches maximum val-
ues for triads with two wavevectors of similar size and
one with quite diﬀerent length [19]. Although, the inter-
actions between triads can be seen mainly as non-local,
the dominant net energy transfer is local, i.e., occurring
between similar scales [13, 30, 31]. The interactions pro-
duce forward and backward energy transfer that com-
bined result in a small net forward energy transfer be-
cause of the detailed balance between contributions that
virtually cancel each other [20]. The forward cascade in
the inertial range was found to be dominated by local
and non-local interactions, while the distant interactions
do not signiﬁcantly transfer energy [29]. All these ﬁnd-
ings concern the classical turbulence forced at the largest
scales.

Against this background, we ask what the turbulence
response will be to a broad-band perturbation of the en-
ergy transfer processes? In recent literature a somewhat

related study was reported in [32]. Decaying turbulence
that starts from an initial condition with an energeti-
cally strongly enhanced small-scale band of modes was
studied. The presence of the extra small-scale band was
found to reduce the intensity of the developing turbu-
lence by enhancing the non-local energy cascade directly
towards smaller scales. This removes the kinetic energy
more eﬃciently. The energy feeding mechanisms and en-
ergy transfer also attract much attention in transitional
and turbulent ﬂows with an active control [33]. The mod-
ulation induced by the broad-band forcing has its conse-
quences not only in the spectral space dynamics of a ﬂow
but also in its physical space transport properties [21].

To analyze the response of turbulence to the additional
broad-band perturbation in more detail we apply pre-
viously developed methods used in the examination of
energy transfer in large-scale forced turbulence [16]. Re-
ferring to Fig. 2, the energy transfer between a wavevec-
tor k = (k1, k2, k3) and all pairs of wavevectors p and
q = k − p with p, q chosen in some prescribed regions
P and Q will be investigated. Such a decomposition al-
lows measuring the contribution of separate scales to the
transfer function T (k, t). The precise speciﬁcation re-
quires a few steps that are presented next. First, we
deﬁne the truncated velocity ﬁeld as

such that p + q = k.

For a statistically isotropic, homogeneous turbulence it
is convenient to average over spherical shells in wavevec-
tor space. In addition, in view of the considerable com-
putational eﬀort involved in computing all interactions
between the very large number of scales present in the
ﬂow, we introduced a slight coarse-graining in terms of
the regions P and Q as shown in Fig. 2. Speciﬁcally,
it was found adequate to group together contributions
from four adjacent shells. Other more coarse ‘groupings’
of wavenumbers have been considered in the literature
with the aim of extracting the dominant interaction pro-
cesses at a reasonable computational eﬀort. As an exam-
ple a ‘logarithmic’ grouping was adopted in [16] combin-
ing contributions from bands with a width of 2k. In this
paper we will look at the interactions of four shells P at
distance kp (cf. Fig. 2) with four shells Q at distance kq
that contribute to the nonlinear energy transfer to shell
Sk characterized by the wavenumber k.

In terms of the transfer function TPQ(k, t) we may now
deﬁne the required spectral transfer functions. The en-
ergy transfer term (17) gives the exchange of energy by
the triad (k, p, q) where the latter two wavevectors are
speciﬁed by the sets P and Q and the triangle constraint.
Summing over all modes k in shell Sk we obtain the ex-
act exchange of energy in the k-th shell between k, kp
and kq:

Tpq(k, kp, kq, t) =

TPQ(k, t).

(20)

k∈Sk

X

We refer to Tpq as the ’three-mode’ transfer. The total
energy transfer function T (k, t) can be computed directly
from (6) or as sum of the contributions from (20):

T (k, t) =

Tp(k, kp, t),

(21)

in which the ’two-mode’ transfer Tp is given by:

Xkp

Xkq

Based on this truncated velocity ﬁeld we may compute
the energy transfer involving the wavevector k and all

Tp(k, kp, t) =

Tpq(k, kp, kq, t).

(22)

The individual transfer-terms T (k, t), Tp(k, kp, t) and
Tpq(k, kp, kq, t) give respectively more detailed character-
istics of the energy transfer. The total transfer T (k, t)
expresses the amount of energy transferred from (nega-
tive) or to (positive) shell Sk. All three transfer-terms
T , Tp and Tpq will be used to investigate the transfer of
energy in the sequel.

D. Simulation details

The numerical integration of the Navier–Stokes equa-
tions (1) is done via a four-stage, second-order, compact-
storage, Runge-Kutta method [34]. To fully remove the
aliasing error we applied a method that employs two
shifted grids and spherical truncation [35]. We con-
sider the canonical problem of forced turbulence in a cu-
bic box of side Lb with periodic boundary conditions.
Direct numerical simulations are characterized by N 3
computational points, where N is the number of grid-
points used in each direction. A detailed description
of the simulation setup and the validation of the nu-
merical procedure can be found in [21]. The compo-
nents of the wavevector k are kα = (2π/Lb)nα where
nα = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , ±(N/2 − 1), −N/2 for α = 1, 2, 3.
The numerical simulations are deﬁned further by the size
of the domain (Lb=1), the computational Reynolds num-
ber Re and the energy injection rates to the two distinct
bands (εw,1, εw,2).

We will study this homogeneous turbulent ﬂow at two
diﬀerent computational Reynolds numbers, i.e., Re =
In case of homogeneous, decay-
1061 and Re = 4243.
ing turbulence these Reynolds numbers correspond to
Rλ = 50 or 100, in terms of the initial Taylor-Reynolds
number [21]. The large-scale forcing of S1 has an energy
injection rate εw,1 = 0.15 that is used as reference case.
For all simulations the fractal dimension was kept con-
stant and equal to Df = 2.6 [27]. The smallest length-
scale that should be accurately resolved depends on the
size of the box, viscous dissipation and energy injection
rate. Usually it is required that kmaxη > 1 [5, 36, 37]
in terms of the Kolmogorov length-scale η and the max-
imal magnitude of the wavevector kmax = πN/Lb that
enters the computations. In our simulations kmaxη ' 2
indicating that the small scales are well resolved.

We consider time-averaged properties of the turbulent

ﬂow. For a function h these are deﬁned by

where T is suﬃciently large. We start the averaging
at t0 = 5 which corresponds to about 10 eddy-turnover
times for the simulated cases. The ﬁnal time was taken
equal to T = 30, so all results are averaged over approxi-
mately 50 eddy-turnover times. The accuracy of this ap-
proximation to the long-time average, measured as the

ratio of the standard deviation and the mean signal is
less than 5% for all investigated quantities.

The energy spectra presented in this paper are shell-
and time-averaged. Moreover, we focus on compensated
spectra Ec in which we use non-dimensional Kolmogorov

units: Ec(k) = h

compensation of the spectrum is not strictly required to
observe the characteristic changes in the energy distribu-
tion, but as it gives more information about the dominant
scales present in a ﬂow it will be used throughout.

III. BROAD-BAND FORCED TURBULENCE

To investigate the energy dynamics in broad-band
forced turbulence, ﬁrst the inﬂuence of variation of the
strength and location of the second forced band Km,p
on the global characteristics and spectrum of the ﬂow is
presented (III A). Then we examine in more detail the
eﬀects of these variations on the energy distribution and
transfer characteristics in the system (III B).

A. Energy distribution in forced turbulence

We ﬁrst concentrate on the application of the high-k
forcing band at diﬀerent locations in spectral space. We
apply a constant energy input rate εw,2 = 0.15 to this
band. Simultaneously, the large-scale forcing to the ﬁrst
shell S1 is εw,1 = 0.15. The computational Reynolds
number is Re = 1061. We forced the bands Kp,p+3 for
p = 5, 9, 17, 25. The parameters of these simulations with
some of the statistics are further presented in the Ap-
pendix (Runs 1 and 14 − 17 in Table I and II are con-
cerned here).

The total kinetic energy, energy dissipation rate and
Taylor-Reynolds number are shown in Fig. 3 as a function
of the location of the left-boundary p of the high-k forced
band Kp,p+3. The ﬁrst data point refers to the classical
large-scale forcing only (Run 1). Application of broad-
band forcing in the diﬀerent bands changes the charac-
teristics of the ﬂow modifying primarily the amount of
small scales. This forcing in the second band is seen to
increase the energy dissipation in the system. The Kol-
mogorov dissipation-scale and the Taylor-Reynolds num-
ber decrease, suggesting that the characteristic scale at
which dissipation plays an important role is shifted to
smaller scales. We notice that the total energy in the
system is only slightly aﬀected by the introduction of
forcing. Moving the broad-band forcing to very small
scales implies that there is no longer a strong inﬂuence
on the ﬂow because the energy injected in the small scales
appears to be also dissipated immediately.

The compensated, shell- and time-averaged, energy
spectrum for diﬀerent locations of the forced region
Kp,p+3 is shown in Fig. 4. We may observe that the

forcing causes a non-local depletion in the energy spec-
trum for the larger scales while the tail of the spectrum
is less aﬀected. The pile up in the energy spectrum near
the forcing region is characteristic of the explicit high-k
forcing and is suggestive of a ‘blocking’ or reverse cascad-
ing. If the separation between S1 and the high-k band
is reduced, then the interaction is stronger and a consid-
erable depletion of the energy levels in the largest scales
arises. This is in agreement with the large-scale forced

turbulence results, where the local and non-local interac-
tions were found to be energetically dominant while the
distant interactions were mainly responsible for transfer-
ring structural information [29].

An eﬀective modulation of turbulent quantities is pos-
sible not only by a change in the range of forced modes

but also via a change in the energy input rate. To investi-
gate this we adopted an energy injection rate εw,1 = 0.15
for the large-scale forcing in S1 and we vary the inten-
sity of forcing in the second band by changing εw,2. We
adopted the following values for εw,2: 0.07, 0.15, 0.30,
0.45, 0.60, 0.75 or 0.90 and considered forcing of four or
eight shells in K17,20 or K17,24, respectively. The param-
eters and characteristic quantities can be found in Table
I and II as Runs 2 − 7 and 8 − 13.

b

The total energy in the system is only slightly aﬀected
by the forcing-strength in the second band as shown in
Fig 5. An increased forcing strength introduces addi-
tional energy into the ﬂow at small scales that is dis-
sipated very eﬃciently. This is expressed by the linear
increase in h
εit. In Fig. 6 we present the compensated en-
ergy spectrum for various strengths of the forcing εw,2.
The energy in the forced region reaches higher values
with increasing εw,2. This may be further observed in
terms of the energy maximum Emax = maxk (Ec(k)) in
Fig. 7. Changing the strength of the broad-band forc-
ing induces a characteristic depletion in the larger scales.
This suggests that the additional forcing term enhances
the nonlinear interactions, which inﬂuence various scales
quite far away from the forced region. The energy that
is injected at the larger scales is transferred even more
eﬀectively through the cascade as εw,2 increases. This
eﬀect appears similar to the so-called spectral short-cut
observed in nature and experiments [25]. In case of such
a short-cut the energy from larger scales is diverted quite
directly to ﬁne scales largely by-passing the traditional
cascading. This mechanism was explained in the case of
ﬂow over forest-canopies in [25]. We will investigate it in
more detail in the next section.

FIG. 8: Location of the maximum energy in the forced region
for four-shell K17,20 (◦) and eight-shell K17,24 (⊲) forced turbu-
lence, measured from the compensated spectra at Re = 1061.

While the energy-maximum Emax shifts to higher val-
ues with increasing strength of the high-k forcing, the
location of the peak moves towards larger scales. This
may be seen from the value of (kη)max at which the
maximum of Ec(k) is attained (cf. Fig. 8). If we inject
the same amount of energy to K17,24 that is two times
wider than K17,20 the maximum of the response decreases
(cf. Fig. 7) while the location of the peak moves towards
smaller scales (cf. Fig. 8). These numerical experiments
are in agreement with observations for decaying turbu-
lence in which initially additional energy is assigned to
small scales [32]. The non-local energy cascade toward
the small scales was found to increase remarkably during
the initial period of decay. This is quite similar to our
observed increase of the dissipation rate arising from an
increased forcing of the high-k band.

A ﬁnal quantiﬁcation of the non-local eﬀect on the
spectrum that arises from the high-k forcing is collected
in Fig. 9. Here we displayed the normalized accumulated
energy

in the consecutive shells. As pointed out, varying the
properties of a ﬂow in a speciﬁed spectral region can
change the behavior of a ﬂow well outside this region.
In terms of SE(k) we notice that close to 90% of the en-
ergy is present in the ﬁrst 10 shells (Fig. 9) when only
the large-scale forcing is applied. Inﬂuencing the ﬂow at
smaller scales in K17,20 is seen to remove most of the en-
ergy from these larger scales while there is only a slight
impact on the dynamics of small scales. This eﬀect be-
comes more pronounced with increasing εw,2. The under-
lying changes in the energy transfer will be considered in
more detail in Sec. IV.

B. Energy transfer spectra

The transfer of energy in turbulence can be described
in spectral space as interactions of triads of wavevectors
(k, p, q) that form triangles, i.e., k = p + q. Direct
numerical simulation with large-scale forcing shows that
non-local interactions between wavevectors combine into
a local energy ﬂow [13, 30]. By applying forcing that is
located in a high-k range of spectral space we perturb the
‘natural’ cascading process. The associated changes in
the transfer of energy will be investigated in more detail
in this subsection. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the energy
transfer and energy transport power spectra.

In large-scale forced turbulence energy is injected into
the ﬁrst shell and removed by the transfer term. This
gives rise to negative values for the energy transfer in
the forced region. In the higher shells the transfer func-
tion takes on positive values which illustrates the trans-
fer of energy through the cascade toward higher k. By
invoking the broad-band forcing we inﬂuence this basic
energy cascade. This is clearly seen in the energy trans-
fer spectrum which develops distinctive regions where

T (k) = hT (k, t)it is negative.
variations in the spectral support of the forcing is shown
while Fig. 11 characterizes changes in the transfer func-
tion due to an increased forcing strength of the high-k
band. The transfer function reaches lower values between
the low- and high-k forcing regions compared to the large-
scale forced case. The reverse situation appears near the
high-k forced band where the transfer increases with an
increase of the forcing intensity. This is in agreement

S1 and K17,20 forced turbulence for diﬀerent strengths of
forcing in the second band εw,2 at Re = 1061. Large-
scale forcing (solid) with additional second band forcing at

with the energy spectra presented earlier, where we ob-
served the depletion of energy between the forced regions.
This eﬀect can be observed more directly from spectra of
energy transport power that will be presented next.

The energy transport power gives the rate at which en-
ergy is transferred from shells k′ < k to those with k′ > k:

band forced turbulence in the K17,24 band at Re = 1061.

mentary forced region k1 < k ≤ k2 is denoted with dotted
lines.

Π(k) = hΠ(k, t)it in Fig. 12 for forcing with various
strengths in the K17,24 band. In case of large-scale forc-
ing only, the transport power is positive for all k as the
energy is transferred toward smaller scales and reaches
zero for large k indicating the general property of the to-
tal transfer function
T (t) = 0. The application of high-k
forcing for k1 < k ≤ k2 changes this well-known picture.
First, we note that the values of the transport power are
all similar in the largest scales, where the ﬂow is gov-
erned by the same energy input. The transport power
for 0 < k ≤ k1 becomes larger at higher εw,2. A strik-
ing change of the behavior arises for k near and inside
the high-k forced region. The transport power spectrum
even assumes negative values for k ≈ k1.

b

The observed behavior of the transport power in
Fig. 12 is partly due to the relatively low Reynolds num-
ber that was used. At suﬃciently high Reynolds num-
bers, the dissipation scales are much more separated from
the high-k forced scales.
In this case a plateau of Π
will arise at low wavenumbers: Π(k, t) ≈ εw,1 for k low
enough [1]. This property is not observed at the compu-
tational Reynolds number considered so far.

In cases speciﬁed by Runs 18 − 19 we consider the
ﬂow at a four times higher computational Reynolds num-
ber. The overall results for the energy spectra and energy
transfer were found to be qualitatively the same as in the
lower Reynolds number cases. However, a plateau may
now be observed in Fig. 13, where we present the trans-
port power for the higher Reynolds number. In this case
the transport power does not decrease below zero in the
forced region. The second forcing band is well separated
from the dissipation region and the transport power in
this band is much larger, approaching a maximum 0.23
that is near the energy injection rate εw,2.

In this section we have looked at the eﬀect of high-k
modulation of the energy cascading process that leads
to an increased energy dissipation in small scales. This
process is supported by an increased energy transfer to
smaller scales via nonlocal triad interactions. The eﬀect
of increased energy rate by the application of broad-band
forcing is seen in the energy transfer and transport power
spectra.
In the next section we will look more closely
at the interactions of various scales of motion under the
inﬂuence of broad-band forcing by considering the two-
and three-mode transfers Tp and Tpq introduced in (22)
and (20).

The energy dynamics of turbulent ﬂow is generally dis-
cussed in terms of the transfer of kinetic energy from
larger to smaller scales through nonlinear interactions.
The statistical properties of turbulence are determined by
these interactions. In the previous section we have shown
how additional broad-band forcing of inertial range scales
can modify the classical picture of the Kolmogorov cas-

cade. To investigate the observed turbulence modulation
eﬀects in more detail we consider the underlying two- and
three-mode energy transfer terms in this section. This
will clarify to some extent the changes in the various
nonlinear interactions that give rise to the observed al-
terations in the spectra and energy transfer.

We start with the three-mode transfer that is averaged
in time Tpq(k, kp, kq) = hTpq(k, kp, kq, t)it and split this
term into its positive and negative parts:

Tpq(k, kp, kq) = T −

to characterize the overall structure of the three-mode
transfer function, even in cases in which the order of
magnitude of Tpq varies considerably. The normalized
energy transfer T pq(k, kp, kq) is plotted in Fig. 14 for
three diﬀerent wavenumbers k/(2π) = 14, 42, 82, based
on Run 19 in which Rλ ∼= 75. The three k-values that
are selected correspond to wavenumbers below the forced
region (k/(2π) = 14) or to wavenumbers that are consid-
erably larger. Such contour maps for T pq can also be
found in [19] for the case of large-scale forced turbulence.
For completeness, we also presented the results from such
large-scale forced turbulence (Run 18) comparing these
directly to the broad-band forced turbulence (Run 19).
This contour map is shown in Fig. 15 for k/(2π) = 46.

The strongest interactions are observed for modes with
wavenumbers between the largest forced scales and the
high-k forced region as can be seen in Fig. 14(a). As
in the case of large-scale forcing only we observe very
strong interactions between Fourier modes of consider-
ably diﬀerent scales. These are located in the corners
of the rectangular domains in the kp-kq plane. Distant
interactions are well separated from the origin in these
ﬁgures. Their contribution to the transfer is seen to be
very small, as also noticed earlier in the literature [19].
The change of sign in the transfer function that occurs at
kp = k and kq = k respectively on the kp-kq planes indi-
cates that in this region the energy is mainly transferred
to higher k.

The most eﬃcient transfer takes place between two
wavevectors of similar size and one of quite diﬀerent size
as seen in the corners of the rectangular area in Fig. 14.
This is in agreement with previous numerical experiments
reported by various authors [2, 16, 19]. However, com-
pared to the case of large-scale forcing only, we now ob-
serve quite extended, highly energetic interactions with
the high-k forced region. The second forced band causes
regions with high intensity of interactions to be much
wider compared to the case of large-scale forcing only.
This is visible directly in Fig. 15. The regions with posi-
tive and negative transfer are extended from the corners
to the wavenumber regions where the actual application
of forcing in the second band occurs. The energy is ex-
changed predominantly between scales that are more sep-
arated than in case of the large-scale forced ﬂow where
the dominant interactions occur only in the corners. This
is a clear indication of the stronger non-local interactions,
mentioned earlier.

manner as Tp(k, kp, kq):

For further clariﬁcation of energy transfer processes
we turn to the time-averaged two-mode energy transfer
Tp(k, kp) = hTp(k, kp)it, which gives information about
the interactions involving a sum over all kq wavenumbers
at ﬁxed k and kp. The sum involves all kq wavenumbers
that are constrained by the triadic interactions, i.e., their
length may vary between |k − p| and |k + p|. We normal-
ized the two-mode transfer function Tp(k, kp) in a similar

where T ±
p , Tmin and Tmax are deﬁned in terms of Tp
in a manner analogous to the deﬁnitions in (26), (27),
(28) and (30).
In Fig. 16 we plotted the contour map
of T p(k, kp). For larger wavenumbers this quantity was
found to look quite similar to the case of large-scale forced

13

Tp(k, kp). This is shown in Fig. 18.
In the large-scale
forced case at εw,2 = 0 the transfer is very small com-
pared to the cases in which the high-k forcing is active. In
addition, the eﬀect is very localized (solid line in Fig. 18).
The forcing in the high-k band completely changes this
behavior. The intensity of the energy transfer is directly
related to the value of εw,2. Additional extrema appear in
the two-mode transfer function. The high-k forced cases
display two pairs in which a negative minimum is com-
bined with a positive maximum, while large scale forcing
only yields one such combination. Correspondingly, the
min-max pair at high k is associated with the large scale
forcing in S1 while the min-max pair at lower k origi-
nates from the additional forcing in the second band. We
also investigated three-band forcing and observed further
peaks in the energy transfer spectra.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We performed direct numerical simulations of broad-
band forced turbulence to explore accumulated eﬀects on
the time-averaged energy transfer in isotropic homoge-
neous turbulence. Using broad-band forcing based on a
recently proposed mathematical model for a fractal stir-
rer [27] we have shown how the application of such forc-
ing modulates turbulence both qualitatively and quan-
titatively. The modulation is similar to that observed
in experiments based on ﬂows through porous media or
canopies. Speciﬁcally the perturbation of a ﬂow arising
from the contact with complex physical boundaries en-
hances the dissipation and causes an abrupt energy drain
from large to small scales. This aspect of simultaneous
perturbation of a ﬂow on a spectrum of length-scales is
retained in the cases studied here.

We found that broad-band forcing that perturbs a tur-
bulent ﬂow at smaller scales enhances non-local triad in-
teractions and alters the detailed cancellation processes
that occur in the traditional large-scale forced ﬂows. This
leads to non-local modiﬁcations in the energy transfer
spectrum and the energy distribution among scales. We
veriﬁed this by partitioning the nonlinear term in the
Navier–Stokes equations in terms of diﬀerent triad contri-
butions to the total transfer function. The energy trans-
port power is found to be enhanced in the spectral region
in between the large-scale and the high-k forced bands.
This characteristic may be inﬂuenced via the control pa-
rameters of the applied forcing, i.e., its strength and ex-
tent of agitated scales, and allows optimizing transport
processes of turbulent ﬂows.

Future study will involve the examination of the con-
sequences of forcing in the physical space context. We
will investigate the geometrical statistics of broad-band
forced turbulence looking at the interactions of strain and
vorticity and their modulation by the applied forcing.
This may help understanding which physical processes
are responsible for the observed modulations and how to
exploit this to enhance physical space mixing.

turbulence. The two-mode transfer function changes
sign from negative to positive at k = kp indicating a
downward energy ﬂow. Comparing this to the large-
scale forced turbulence we observe (i) strong inﬂuence
of forcing in the regions where it is applied (denoted
with dashed lines), (ii) extended negative energy trans-
fer region with comparatively high magnitude above the
k = kp line, (iii) ampliﬁcation of the backward energy
transfer indicated by the positive region for small k and
large kp. This region is separated from the intense nega-
tive energy transfer region by the indicated accumulation
of contour lines above the k = kp line appearing as the
curved black line.

A more quantitative overview is plotted in Fig. 17
displaying the two-mode transfer function in the range
kp/(2π) = 30, 34, . . . , 94. This clearly shows the cascad-
ing character of the energy ﬂow from larger to smaller
scales in the system. The modiﬁcation due to the high-
k forcing expresses itself by the sequence of one slightly
positive, two quite negative and one quite positive lo-
cal extrema. The intensity of the energy transfer de-
creases with increasing wavenumbers as less energy needs
to be transferred. This corresponds directly to the mag-
nitude of Tmin(k) and Tmax(k) used in the normalization
of Tp(k, kp) (31). The part in which the transfer is neg-
ative is much wider in the broad-band forced case com-
pared to the large-scale forced turbulence results.

We conclude by considering the eﬀect of varying the
forcing strength εw,2 at a characteristic wavenumber
kp/(2π) = 30 on the two-mode energy transfer function

TABLE I: Direct numerical simulation parameters using a res-
olution of N = 128 and Re = 1061 in Runs 1 − 17, and a res-
olution of N = 256 at Re = 4243 in Runs 18 − 19. The cases
with large-scale forcing only are denoted by ⋆. In this table
εw denotes the energy input-rate in the high-k band, except
Run 1 and 18 in which it corresponds to the energy input-rate
in S1. Moreover, m and p characterize the spectral support
of the high-k band Km,p.

APPENDIX

The main parameters of the simulations are collected
in Table I. The corresponding statistics of the veloc-
ity ﬁelds are summarized in Table II. The quanti-
ties compiled in Table II are the Kolmogorov dissipa-
tion wavenumber kd which is the inverse of the Kol-
mogorov length-scale η, the product kmaxη, the Tay-
k k2E(k, t))1/2, the Taylor-
lor microscale λ = (5
microscale Reynolds number Rλ = λu′/ν, the inte-
P
k k−1E(k, t), the in-
gral length-scale L = 3π/(4
tegral Reynolds number RL = Lu′/ν, the r.m.s veloc-
P

ity u′ = (2
E/3)1/2, the energy dissipation rate ε =
k 2νk2E(k, t), the eddy-turnover time τ = L/u′ and
the skewness S = 2/35 (λ/u′)3
k k2T (k, t). All these
P
quantities in Table II are time-averaged h·it as described
in Sec. II D.

We also checked that the alteration of the cascading
process caused by the high-k forcing does not inﬂuence
the isotropy of the ﬂow ﬁeld. A measure of isotropy was
suggested in [38] given by: I 2(t) = ψ1(t)/ψ2(t) where
are
ψ1(t) =

|e1(k)u(k, t)|2
(cid:10)

, ψ2(k, t) =
(cid:11)

|e2(k)u(k, t)|2

the kinetic energy along the components of two orthogo-
nal solenoidal unit vectors e1(k) = k × z(k)/|k × z(k)|,
e2(k) = k × e1(k)/|k × e1(k)| where z(k) is a randomly
oriented unit vector. The operator h·i denotes averaging
over these random unit vectors. For isotropic turbulence
one can expect to ﬁnd I = 1, i.e., ψ1 = ψ2 which was
conﬁrmed to close approximation in all simulations. De-
viations from the expected value for I were found to be
of the order of 1%.

Critical Behaviour in the Relaminarisation of Localised Turbulence in Pipe Flow

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The statistics of the relaminarisation of localised turbulence in a pipe are examined by direct
numerical simulation. As in recent experimental data (Peixinho & Mullin Phys. Rev. Lett. 96,
094501, 2006), the half life for the decaying turbulence is consistent with the scaling (Rec − Re)−1
,
indicating a boundary crisis of the localised turbulent state familiar in low-dimensional dynamical
systems. The crisis Reynolds number, is estimated as Rec = 1870, a value within 7% of the
experimental value 1750. We argue that the frequently-asked question of which Re and initial
disturbance are needed to trigger sustained turbulence in a pipe, is really two separate questions:
the ‘local phase space’ question (local to the laminar state) of what threshold disturbance at a given
Re is needed to initially trigger turbulence, followed by the ‘global phase space’ question of whether
Re exceeds Rec at which point the turbulent state becomes an attractor.

Understanding the behaviour of ﬂuid ﬂow through a
circular straight pipe remains one of the outstanding
problems of classical physics and has continued to in-
trigue the physics community for more than 160 years
[1],[2],[3],[4]. Although all evidence indicates that the
laminar parabolic ﬂow is linearly stable, the ﬂow can be-
come turbulent even at modest ﬂow rates. The exact
transition point depends not only on the ﬂow rate (mea-
sured by the Reynolds number Re = U D/ν, where U
is the axial ﬂow speed, D is the pipe diameter and ν
is the ﬂuid’s kinematic viscosity) but also sensitively on
the shape and amplitude of the disturbance(s) present
[5], [6], [7], [8]. When it occurs, transition is abrupt
with the ﬂow immediately becoming temporally and spa-
tially complex. Given that most industrial pipe ﬂows
are turbulent and hence more costly to power than if
laminar, a central issue is to understand the conditions
which trigger sustained turbulence. The problem is, how-
ever, severely complicated by the fact that the threshold
appears very sensitive to the exact form of the distur-
bance and long turbulent transients can exist close to the
threshold. Of particular interest is the low-Re situation
where the transition typically leads to a clearly localised
turbulent structure called a ‘puﬀ’ within the laminar ﬂow
[3], [9]. A puﬀ has a typical length of about 20D along
the pipe (see Fig. 1) and, despite appearing established,
can relaminarise without warning after travelling many
hundreds of pipe diameters downstream.

There have been a number of contributions to this
problem but so far no consensus on the minimum
Reynolds number, Rec, above which turbulence is sus-
tained. Experimental studies have focussed on plotting
transition-threshold curves in disturbance amplitude-Re
space for speciﬁc forms of applied perturbation. One
well-studied perturbation having six-fold rotational sym-
metry gave rise to a threshold amplitude which scaled like
Re−1 above Re = 2000 [6] but diverged at Rec ≈ 1800
[7], i.e. below this value no sustained turbulence could
be excited however hard the ﬂow was disturbed. Sub-

sequent experiments [8] studying the statistics of relam-
inarisations of puﬀs as Re is reduced have lowered this
threshold value to Rec = 1750 ± 10, close to a previous
estimate of 1760 [5] but not to others of 1876 [10] and
≈ 2000 [9]. The only complementary numerical work
performed so far has been in a short periodic pipe of 5D
length [11] where it was demonstrated that the pipe-long
turbulent state displays the transient characteristics of a
chaotic repellor until Rec = 2250 above which it becomes
a chaotic attractor. Recent experiments using a very long
pipe [12] in which the statistics on long transients are
available, however, suggests that there is no critical be-
haviour. Rather than the turbulent half life scaling like
τ ∼ (Rec − Re)−1 [8],[11], it is found to increase expo-
nentially instead. Interestingly, re-interpretation of the
5D-pipe data seems to corroborate this alternative ex-
ponential lifetime behaviour even though the pipe is too
short to capture a turbulent puﬀ.

In this Letter, we consider a much longer pipe of length
16πD (≈ 50D) in which turbulent puﬀs can be repre-
sented faithfully using direct numerical simulation [13]
and examine the statistics of how they relaminarise. We
ﬁnd an exponential distribution of lifetimes and the crit-
ical scaling law τ ∼ (Rec − Re)−1, with a constant of
proportionality and an estimate of Rec = 1870 both in
good agreement with experimental data [8]. Surprisingly,
given its long history, this represents the ﬁrst time that a
quantitative connection between theory and experiment
has been established in the pipe ﬂow problem.

solutions and the statistical properties of turbulent pipe
ﬂow [14] (as well as being cross-validated with another
code [15]). A resolution of 40 radial points was adopted
with grid points concentrated at the boundary, Fourier
modes were kept up to ±24 in θ, and to ±384 in z for a
periodic pipe of length L = 16π D. This ensured spec-
tral drop oﬀ of 6 orders of magnitude in the power of
the coeﬃcients when representing a puﬀ velocity ﬁeld at
Re = 1900: see inset in Fig. 2. The timestep was dy-
namically controlled using information from a predictor-
corrector method and was typically around 0.006 D/U .
The initial conditions for the calculations were randomly-
selected velocity snapshots taken from a long puﬀ simu-
lation performed at Re = 1900. A body forcing applied
over 10D of the pipe and for a time 10 D/U was used
to generate an ‘equilibrium’ puﬀ which remained stable
in length and form for a time period of over 2000 D/U
(see Fig. 1). At a chosen Re < 1900 a series of at least
40 and up to 60 independent simulations were performed
each initiated with a diﬀerent puﬀ snapshot to generate
a data set of relaminarisation times. The signature of
the relaminarisation was a clear and sudden transition

to exponential decay of the energy. The criterion for re-
laminarisation was taken to be such that the energy of the
axially-dependent modes was less than 5 × 10−4 ρU 2D3,
below which all solutions were well within the decaying
regime. The range of measured Rec discussed above in-
dicates sensitivity to noise. Robustness of the relaminar-
isation statistics was veriﬁed by comparing the half-lives
of data sets obtained by varying diﬀerent computational
parameters of the simulation (see Fig. 2). All modiﬁca-
tions produce half-life values within the 95% conﬁdence
interval about the default half-life prediction.

Decay probabilities for a range of Reynolds numbers
are shown in Fig. 3 over an observation window of
1000 D/U . The linear drop-oﬀ of the probability on the
log-plot strongly suggests the exponential distribution,
P (T ) ∼ exp(−T ln 2/τ ), where τ = τ (Re) is the half-life
of a puﬀ. The median of (T −t0) was used as an estimator
for τ . Inspection of the data by varying the cut-oﬀ time
t0 revealed the eﬀects of an initial transient period in
the ﬁrst few data points. This was minimised by select-
ing t0 to exclude the ﬁrst 5-10% of the data (determined
by looking for the least sensitivity in the half-life predic-
tion). The results plotted in Fig. 4 are consistent with
the relation τ = α(Rec − Re)−1 where α is 2.4 × 10−4
compared to 2.8 × 10−4 obtained in [8] and there is a
shift of 7% in Rec up to 1870 in the numerical data.
Also shown is the reinterpreted numerical data for the
5D pipe [11] and the recent half-life results from the long
pipe experiments [12] which indicate that 1/τ varies ex-
ponentially with Re rather than linearly. Although the
data from [12] is for longer times, there is suﬃcient over-

lap to suggest that the data from [8] and our results are
not consistent with being the earlier linear-looking part
of this exponential. Rather, the results indicate qualita-
tively diﬀerent behaviour [28].

The exponential probability distribution P (T ) found
here in Fig. 3 implies that puﬀ relaminarisation is a mem-
oryless process - the probability that the puﬀ will decay
in a given interval of time is proportional to the length
of the period but independent of previous events. This
feature has been found previously in turbulent relami-
narisation experiments in pipe ﬂow [8],[12],[16] as well
as in plane Couette ﬂow [17],[18] and numerical calcu-
lations using models of this together with other linearly
stable shear ﬂows [19],[20]. Faisst and Eckhardt [11] in-
terpret this result as indicating that the transient tur-
bulent state for Re < Rec represents a chaotic repellor
in phase space. Our results indicate that this conclusion
carries over to a localised turbulent puﬀ in a long pipe.
The building blocks for such a repellor are saddle points
and families of these in the form of travelling waves with
discrete rotational symmetries are now known to exist
down to Re = 1251 [21], [22], [23]. Tentative experimen-
tal evidence for their relevance to puﬀs has already been
found [24] and corroborating numerical evidence is now
emerging [15]. The entanglement of all the stable and
unstable manifolds associated with these saddles at some
higher Re presumably gives rise to suﬃciently compli-
cated phase dynamics to appear as a turbulent puﬀ in
real space. That this phase space structure is initially
‘leaky’ ultimately allowing escape (relaminarisation) is
perhaps unsurprising but what is less clear is how it sud-
denly becomes an attractor at Rec. The clean scaling of
the transient decay half life, τ ∼ (Rec − Re)−1 strongly
suggests a boundary crisis [25] while the precise value of

the critical exponent hints at a simple dynamical systems
explanation. One, of course, cannot rule out the possi-
bility that the region never becomes an attractor with
the exit probability becoming extremely small but stay-
ing ﬁnite as Re increases [12]. Or, in fact, that there
are a number of ‘leaks’ which one by one seal up giving
a half-life behaviour which varies over a number of dis-
crete time scales. Also, at some point, the eﬀect of noise
must surely become signiﬁcant over long times. However,
the fact that the numerical simulations and the experi-
mental results [8] are quantitatively consistent despite
being subject to diﬀerent types of errors/disturbances
indicates that noise is not important over timescales of
O(1000 D/U ) for the levels maintained here and in the
experiments.

The simulations conﬁrm that the puﬀ characteristics
are continuous as Re crosses Rec and that a puﬀ corre-
sponds to a part of phase space disjoint from the laminar
state (see Fig. 5 and inset). This observation naturally
divides the usual question as to how to trigger sustained
turbulence in pipe ﬂow into two separate issues. Firstly,
what disturbance at a given Re is needed to trigger tur-
bulence initially — i.e. what initial conditions will cause
the ﬂow to leave the neighbourhood of the laminar state
to reach the puﬀ region of phase space. And secondly,
what Re is needed so that, for a ﬂow already in the tur-
bulent region, the ﬂow never leaves — i.e. the puﬀ has
become an attractor. The implications of this realisa-
tion are that experimental curves in [5] and [7] showing
a threshold curve on a disturbance amplitude-Re plot
must, in fact, be two curves as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 5
shows how initially a threshold amplitude of disturbance

[27] Incompressibility was satisﬁed automatically by adopt-
ing a toroidal-poloidal potential formulation [26], further
reformulated into ﬁve simple second order equations in r.
The numerical discretization was via a non-equispaced 9-
point ﬁnite diﬀerence stencil in r and by Fourier modes in
θ and z. At the pipe wall boundary conditions coupling
the potentials were solved to numerical precision using
an inﬂuence-matrix method, and axial symmetry prop-
erties imposed by the geometry on each Fourier mode
were enforced implicitly in the ﬁnite diﬀerence weights.
[28] In [12], the ﬂow is disturbed by a jet of injected ﬂuid much
as in earlier experiments [7] where a six-jet disturbance
was used. This latter study found that results were sensi-
tive to the exact ﬂux fraction of the laminar ﬂow injected,
with a (large) value of 0.1 giving Rec = 1710±10 whereas
a (small) disturbance of 0.01 gave Rec = 1830 ± 10: [12]
quote injected ﬂux rates of ≈ 0.07.

is required to push the solution away from the laminar
state and into the turbulent region. Once here, the exit
from the metastable state is sudden and unrelated to the
entry as relaminarisation is a memoryless process.

To summarise, numerical simulations described in this
Letter have clariﬁed the existence of two independent
thresholds for sustained turbulence. Results probing the
relaminarisation threshold closely match a recent exper-
imental investigation [8]. For timescales extending these
experiments — t ≤ 1000 D/U — we conﬁrm the presence
of an exponential distribution for the probability of puﬀ
relaminarisation and corroborate critical-type behaviour
in which the puﬀ half-life diverges as (Rec−Re)−1. Good
quantitative agreement between the experimentally and
theoretically-estimated value of Rec (less than 7% diﬀer-
ence) is a rare triumph in this famous canonical problem.

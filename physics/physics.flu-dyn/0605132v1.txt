We analyze the linear stability of the edge of a thin liquid metal layer sub jet to a transverse

high-frequeny AC magneti (cid:28)eld. The layer is treated as a perfetly onduting liquid sheet that

allows us to solve the problem analytially for both a semi-in(cid:28)nite geometry with a straight edge

and a thin disk of (cid:28)nite radius. It is shown that the long-wave perturbations of a straight edge

are monotonially unstable when the wave number exeeds the ritial value kc = F0/(γl0) whih
is determined by the linear density of the eletromagneti fore F0 ating on the edge, the surfae
tension γ, and the e(cid:27)etive arlength of edge thikness l0 . The perturbations with wavelength

shorter than the ritial are stabilized by the surfae tension, whereas the growth rate of long

wave perturbations redues as

∼ k for k → 0. Thus, there is the fastest growing perturbation with
the wave number kmax = 2/3kc. When the layer is arranged vertially, long-wave perturbations

are stabilized by the gravity, and the ritial perturbation is haraterized by the apillary wave

p

number kc =
gρ/γ , where g is the aeleration due to gravity and ρ is the density of metal. In
this ase, the ritial linear density of eletromagneti fore is F0,c = 2kcl0γ that orresponds to the
πkcl0Lγ/µ0 when the magneti (cid:28)eld is generated by a straight
ritial urrent amplitude I0,c = 4
wire at the distane L diretly above the edge. By applying the general approah developed for
the semi-in(cid:28)nite sheet, we (cid:28)nd that a irular disk of radius R0 plaed in a transverse uniform
high-frequeny AC magneti (cid:28)eld with the indution amplitude B0 beomes linearly unstable with
respet to exponentially growing perturbation with the azimuthal wave number m = 2 when the
magneti Bond number exeeds Bmc = B2

INTRODUCTION

In several indution melting proesses, like the old ruible or eletromagneti levitation, liquid metal with a free

surfae is sub jet to AC magneti (cid:28)elds whih may ause onsiderable deformations of liquid metal resulting from

the eletromagneti fores due to the eddy urrents, whih are often on(cid:28)ned in a thin skin layer beneath the surfae

[1℄. It has been observed that the free surfae sometimes may beome strongly asymmetri and even irregular when

a su(cid:30)iently strong magneti (cid:28)eld is applied [9, 10, 11℄.

Most of theoretial studies of the e(cid:27)et of AC magneti (cid:28)eld on the stability liquid metal surfaes have been

onerned with (cid:29)at surfaes sub jet to tangential uniform magneti (cid:28)eld. MHale and Melher [2℄ were the (cid:28)rst to

show that the time-averaged eletromagneti fore has a destabilizing e(cid:27)et giving rise to traveling waves on the surfae

of liquid metal. Although the theoretial instability threshold is in a good agreement with experimental results, the

predited growth rates are too small ompared to the experimental observations. Note that suh small growth rates

are typial for the eletromagneti instabilities aused the urrents indued by motion of onduting media in AC

magneti (cid:28)elds [3℄. Later this simple model has been revisited by a number of authors using various approximations.

First, Garnier and Moreau [4℄ (cid:28)nd that AC magneti (cid:28)eld has only stabilizing e(cid:27)et on the surfae waves when the

the urrents indued by metal (cid:29)ow are negleted. Deepak and Evans [5℄ take into aount the motion of surfae but

not the assoiated (cid:29)ow in the liquid, although both have omparable e(cid:27)et, and onlude that AC magneti (cid:28)eld

an however give rise to unstable traveling surfae waves. Stability of a (cid:29)at metal layer suspended by means of a

uniform magneti (cid:28)eld, as in the experiment of Hull et al. [7℄, has been studied by Ramos and Castellanos [6℄ who

analyze the e(cid:27)et of the visosity on Rayleigh-Taylor type instability whih is unavoidable in this system. Fautrelle

and Sneyd [8℄ use more elaborate model taking into aount not only the time-averaged but also the osillating part of

the eletromagneti fore, that results in muh stronger parametri instabilities when the frequeny of surfae waves

is su(cid:30)iently lose to the multiple of the eletromagneti fore frequeny. Note that this simple model of (cid:29)at surfae

with tangential magneti (cid:28)eld leads only to traveling but not stationary wave instabilities whih require onsideration

of non-planar surfaes in nonuniform magneti (cid:28)elds. A stability analysis was performed by Karher and Mohring

[12℄ to desribe the experimental observations of stati surfae instabilities by Mohring et al. [11℄. However, drasti

simpli(cid:28)ations were made in the latter analysis. Firstly, the authors use the mirror image method to (cid:28)nd the magneti

(cid:28)eld distribution at the end of annular gap (cid:28)lled with liquid metal, however this method is appliable only to simple

geometries, like half-spae or a sphere [13℄. Seondly, they neglet the e(cid:27)et of surfae perturbation on the magneti

(cid:28)eld distribution, although the oupling between both onstitutes the basi mehanism of this instability.

In this work, we propose a new, simple theoretial model to desribe suh stati surfae instabilities. The model

onsists of a (cid:29)at liquid metal layer in a transverse AC magneti (cid:28)eld. The AC frequeny is assumed to be high

so that the magneti (cid:28)eld is e(cid:27)etively expelled from the layer by the skin e(cid:27)et. The layer is assumed to be thin

so that it an be regarded as a liquid perfetly onduting sheet. We start with the linear stability analysis of the

straight edge of a semi-in(cid:28)nite liquid sheet, that allows us to work out a general approah, whih is applied later

to the liquid layer in the magneti (cid:28)eld of a straight wire parallel to the edge and to thin irular liquid disk in a

uniform transverse magneti (cid:28)eld. We desribe a new pinh-type instability of the edge of liquid metal sheet with

the following mehanism. The magneti (cid:28)eld bends around the edge of perfetly onduting sheet, giving rise to the

magneti pressure on the edge whih tries to ompress the sheet laterally. In the ase of straight edge, the uniform

magneti pressure along the edge is balaned by a onstant pressure in the sheet. A wave-like perturbation of the edge

auses the magneti (cid:29)ux lines to diverge at wave rests and onvergene at troughs. This redistribution is beause

the magneti (cid:29)ux lines along the sheet are perpendiular to the eletri urrent lines whih are direted along the

edge and, thus, the magneti (cid:29)ux lines have to be perpendiular to the latter. As the result, the magneti pressure is

redued at the rests and inreased at the troughs that enhanes the perturbation.

The paper is organized as follows. In setion 2, we onsider the general model of a semi-in(cid:28)nite perfetly onduting

liquid sheet with a straight edge, and ompare with the experiment. In setion 3, the linear stability problem for

a thin disk in a transverse magneti (cid:28)eld is solved and ompared with experiment. The results are summarized in

Setion 4.

II. PERFECTLY CONDUCTING LIQUID SHEET

A. Mathematial model

Consider a thin layer of liquid metal submitted to a transverse AC magneti (cid:28)eld B. We assume that the layer is
z plane, so that the unperturbed edge of the layer oinides with
semi-in(cid:28)nite and lies in the right hand side of x
z axis, as shown in Fig. 1. Field frequeny is assumed to be high, so that the layer is e(cid:27)etively impermeable to the

−

magneti (cid:28)eld beause of the skin e(cid:27)et. In addition, the layer is assumed to be a thin sheet in a stati equilibrium

state supported by a (cid:29)at horizontal non-wetting surfae or onstrained in the gap between two parallel walls. Note

3

that this model represents a speial ase of a thin superondutor (cid:28)lm (see, e.g., [14℄). The magneti (cid:28)eld B in the
free spae around the sheet an be desribed by the salar magneti potential Ψ. Then the solenoidity onstraint

B = 0 results in

Ψ0(r, ϕ) = C0√r cos(ϕ/2),

where n is the surfae normal vetor. First, we fous on the distribution of the magneti (cid:28)eld in the viinity of the
edge, whih an onveniently be desribed in the ylindrial oordinates with the z axis oiniding with the edge and
the polar angle ϕ measured from the x axis, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The solution for unperturbed potential in the

viinity of straight edge satisfying ondition (2) is [15℄

where C0 is an unknown onstant. Aording to simple dimensional arguments determining C0 requires an external
length sale whih, however, is missing in this simple model. Thus, C0 an be determined for a strip of (cid:28)nite width,

a magneti (cid:28)eld generated by a straight wire plaed at some distane parallel to the edge or a irular disk of (cid:28)nite

size, that will be done in the following setion. But (cid:28)rst, we develop a general approah without speifying C0.

Suppose that there is a perturbation of the edge position x = x1(z, t) = ˆx(t) cos(kz) with a small, generally
time-dependent amplitude ˆx(t) and the wave number k along z axis. This perturbation gives rise to the potential

perturbation whih an be presented as

Ψ(r, ϕ, z) = Ψ0(r, ϕ) + εΨ1(r, ϕ, z) + . . . ,

where Ψ1 is a perturbation with small amplitude ε. To relate the perturbation of potential to that of the edge, we
need an additional ondition at the edge whih is derived as follows. For the surfae urrent with density J, we have
B [15℄, where µ0 is the permeability of vauum. Aording to this relation, the magneti (cid:28)eld along the
µ0J = n

×

sheet is perpendiular to the urrent. Consequently the magneti (cid:28)eld has be to perpendiular to the edge beause

the urrent is (cid:29)owing along the latter. Thus along the edge L, we obtain (τ
unit vetor tangential to the edge. This ondition in turn implies that Ψ

|L = 0, where τ is the
|L = const , where const = 0 may be hosen

|L = ∂Ψ/∂τ

·

beause the potential is de(cid:28)ned up to an additive onstant. Applying this ondition at the perturbed edge, we obtain

up the (cid:28)st order terms in perturbation amplitude

whih results in

Note that the base potential annot formally be expanded in power series diretly at the edge beause the neessary

derivative is singular there. To irumvent this, we take the expansion not exatly at the edge but de(cid:28)ne it as a limit

when the expansion point approahes the edge.

The potential perturbation whih satis(cid:28)es (2) is of the same form as the base (cid:28)eld

. Thus perturbation of the edge results just in rede(cid:28)nition of the onstant C0 whih
˜C0, whereas the distribution of potential remains the same as for the straight edge obtained above.

This is beause a smoothly perturbed edge looks straight again when examined on su(cid:30)iently small sale. The salar

magneti potential in viinity of a straight edge and its perturbation amplitude de(cid:28)ned by (6) are plotted in Fig. 2

with 1/k used as the length sale. The orresponding magneti (cid:29)ux and urrent lines along the layer in viinity of

perturbed edge are shown in Fig. 3. As seen, the magneti (cid:29)ux lines diverge at wave rests and onverge at troughs

in order to remain perpendiular to the edge, as disussed above. This redistribution of the magneti (cid:29)ux lines at the

perturbed edge is the prinipial physial mehanism behind the instability onsidered in this study.

In the perfet ondutor approximation, the eletromagneti fore due to AC magneti (cid:28)eld redues to an e(cid:27)etive

magneti pressure ating on the surfae of the layer with the time-averaged value pm =

B0
|

2 /(4µ0), where B0 is
|

the amplitude of AC magneti (cid:28)eld. Note that the part of the magneti pressure, whih osillates with double AC

frequeny, is negleted here by assuming the frequeny to be so high that inertia preludes any onsiderable reation

1/r and, thus, it beomes
of the liquid. Aording to (5), the magneti pressure inreases towards the edge as ∼
singular at r = 0. Nevertheless, the integral fore on the edge has a (cid:28)nite value. This is beause the magneti pressure
1/d0 whih integrated over the thikness results
d0 inreases as ∼
at the edge of layer of small but (cid:28)nite thikness ∼
in a (cid:28)nite value independent of d0 . The fore on the edge an be evaluated by integrating the Maxwell stress tensor
over a small ylindrial surfae S enlosing the edge, as shown in Fig. 4, that results to the (cid:28)rst order terms in

Further, we assume the sheet to be an invisid liquid, and onsider a small-amplitude potential (cid:29)ow assoiated with

the edge perturbation. Justi(cid:28)ation of this assumption, partiularly at the threshold of monotonous instability, is

disussed at the end of the setion. Then the linearized Euler equation applied to a potential veloity (cid:28)eld v =

B. Comparison with experiment

To ompare our theory with the experiment of Mohring et al. [11℄, we, similarly to [12℄, unfold the annular layer of

InGaSn (Galinstan) melt used in experiment by approximating it by a semi-in(cid:28)nite (cid:29)at perfetly onduting liquid

sheet. Magneti (cid:28)eld is approximated by that of a straight wire lying at the distane L from the edge in the plane of
the sheet. The distane L provides us with the length sale neessary to speify the onstant C0 used in our model

above. This onstant follows from the omplex potential of the magneti (cid:28)eld whih is obtained by the onformal

mapping

where ζ = x + iy, as C0 = µ0I0/(π√L). The magneti (cid:29)ux lines and isolines of the salar magneti potential
represented by real and imaginary part of this omplex potential are shown in Fig. 6(a) with L used as the length
sale. In addition, we onsider the gravity with the aeleration g = exg direted downwards along the sheet normally
to its edge. Then Eqs. (13) and (8) with C0 de(cid:28)ned above result in

As easy to see, the gravity stabilizes long-wave disturbanes, whereas short waves are stabilized by the surfae tension.

Thus, the (cid:28)rst unstable mode, de(cid:28)ned by λ(kc) = 0, appears at the apillary wave number kc =

ompare this result with the measured ritial urrents[11℄, note that the oil used in the experiment onsists of two

horizontal layers, eah of whih ontaining (cid:28)ve windings. Thus, the measured urrent has to be multiplied by ten

to obtain the total urrent amplitude. Unfortunately, the authors do not speify the oil dimensions but give only

the gap width Lexp = 17 mm between the metal surfae and the lower side of the indutor whih is not su(cid:30)ient for
omparison with our theory. Therefore we treat the distane L as a free parameter to (cid:28)t the experimental results
that yields L
45 mm (see Fig. 7). Note that the model of a semi-in(cid:28)nite layer may be not very adequate for the
given experiment with the layer extention H = 24 mm whih is omparable to the gap width L, espeially when the

III. A THIN LIQUID DISK

A. Analytial solution

Now we will apply the approah developed in the previous setion to a thin irular liquid disk of radius R0 and
(cid:28)xed thikness d0 whih is sub jeted to a uniform axial AC magneti (cid:28)eld with an indution amplitude B0, as shown
in Fig. 8. The thikness d0 is assumed to be small relative to the radius of disk d0
R0, so that the disk may be
regarded as a thin sheet. The magneti (cid:28)eld is sought in terms of the salar magneti potential Ψ governed by Eq.

B. Comparison with experiment

In the experiment, whose detailed desription may be found in [9℄, a (cid:29)at irular Gallium drop of thikness d0

6 mm and radius R0
into a 6-winding solenoidal oil supplied by AC urrent of f

≈
30 mm was plaed on a glass plate, whih was slightly onave to enter the drop, and put
13 kHz frequeny. At low urrents in the oil, the drop

≈

≈

was observed to be nearly irular, as seen in Fig. 11(a), and remained suh until the urrent exeeded some ritial

value, after whih the drop beame notieable distorted, as seen in Fig. 11(b). Further urrent inrease resulted in the

development of more orrugated drop shapes shown in Fig. 11(). Aording to the experimental observations, the

irular shape beame unstable about the magneti (cid:28)eld indution amplitude in the range 12.9 mT < B0 < 23.5 mT.
Assuming the layer to have approximately uniform urvature over the edge thikness with the radius r0
d0/2 that
13.4 mT for the ritial Bond number
orresponds to an arlength l0
Bmc = 3π, where γ = 0.718 N/m is the surfae tension of Gallium [20℄. This ritial (cid:28)eld strength is slightly higher
30
than that in Fig. 11(a) but onsiderably lower than that in Fig. 11(b). For the latter ase we have Bm ≈
1 = 8 de(cid:28)ning the range of linearly instable modes
that orresponds to the ritial wave number mc = [Bm/π]

mc. Note that the shape seen in 11(b) has m
number, though the fastest growing mode in this ase is mmax = 6. Given the simpliity of our theoretial model,

πd0/2, we (cid:28)nd B0,c = √πBmcµ0γd0/R0

these results may be regarded to agree well with the experiment. There may be several reasons whih prelude a

better agreement with the experiment. First, the drop seen in Fig. 11(b) has a signi(cid:28)ant perturbation amplitude

implying that its shape may be a(cid:27)eted by nonlinear e(cid:27)ets whih are not aounted for by this linear stability

analysis. Seond, our model of a thin perfetly onduting sheet may be too simple for the given experiment with the

relative drop thikness d0/R0

is the

eletrial ondutivity of Gallium [20℄.

Note that our theory is developed for a disk of (cid:28)xed thikness whih exludes mode m = 0 while, in the experiment,

the upper surfae of layer is free and this mode is permitted. Nevertheless, the theory is appliable also to this ase

beause small-amplitude modes with m

1 are not oupled with the mode m = 0. The only di(cid:27)erene is that the

≥

thikness of layer may vary depending on the magneti (cid:28)eld. But one the equilibrium thikness is known, our theory

an be used to predit whether the droplet will remain irular or not on the further inrease of the magneti (cid:28)eld.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed the linear stability of the edge of a thin liquid metal layer sub jet to a transverse high-frequeny

AC magneti (cid:28)eld. The metal layer was onsidered in the perfet ondutor approximation supposing the AC frequeny

to be high so that the magneti (cid:28)eld is e(cid:27)etively expelled from the layer, while the thikness of the layer was assumed

to be small relative to its lateral extension so that the the layer ould e(cid:27)etively be modeled as a thin perfetly

onduting liquid sheet. First, we onsidered a general model of semi-in(cid:28)nite sheet with a straight edge. This model,

admitting an analyti solution, allowed us to identify a new pinh-type instability of the edge with the following simple

mehanism. The magneti (cid:28)eld bending around the edge of perfetly onduting layer reates a magneti pressure on

the edge trying to ompress the layer laterally. In the basi state with straight edge, the magneti pressure, whih

is uniform along the edge, is balaned by a onstant hydrostati pressure in the layer. Perturbation of the edge in

the form of a wave auses divergene of magneti (cid:29)ux lines at the wave rests and onvergene in the troughs. This

redistribution is beause the magneti (cid:29)ux lines along the the sheet are perpendiular to the urrent lines. But sine

the latter are aligned along the edge, the magneti (cid:28)eld has be perpendiular to it. Consequently, the magneti

pressure is redued at the rests and inreased at the troughs that drives the instability. Note that in this model of

the edge. We irumvented this singularity by onsidering the sheet to have a small but nevertheless (cid:28)nite thikness

thin sheet, the indution varies with the distane r from the edge as ∼
d0. Then integration of the magneti pressure, whih sales as ∼
the long-wave perturbations are unstable when the wave number exeeds some ritial value kc = F0/(γl0) whih
is determined by the linear density of the eletromagneti fore F0 ating on the edge, the surfae tension γ, and
the e(cid:27)etive edge arlength l0 . The perturbations with wavelength shorter than the ritial are stabilized by the

1/d0 , over the thikness d0 resulted in a (cid:28)nite integral

1/√r and, thus, it formally beomes singular at

fore on the edge independent of its atual thikness. This allowed us to obtain an analytial solution showing that

0. Thus, there is the
surfae tension, whereas the growth rate of long wave perturbations redues as ∼
fastest growing perturbation with the wave number kmax = 2/3kc. When the layer is arranged vertially, long-wave

k for k

→

perturbations are stabilized by the gravity, and the ritial perturbation is haraterized by the apillary wave number

gρ/γ. In this ase, the ritial linear density of eletromagneti fore is F0,c = 2kcl0γ that orresponds to
kc =
the ritial urrent amplitude I0,c = 4
πkcl0Lγ/µ0 when the magneti (cid:28)eld is generated by a straight wire at the
distane L diretly above the edge. Next, we solved analytially the linear stability problem for a thin irular disk

p

p

plaed in a transverse uniform high-frequeny AC magneti (cid:28)eld. It was found that the irular shape of the disk

beomes unstable with respet to exponentially growing perturbation with the azimuthal wave number m = 2 at the
ritial magneti Bond number Bmc = 3π. For Bm > Bmc the wave number of the fastest growing perturbation is
mmax = [2Bm/(3π)] . These theoretial results were found in a reasonably good agreement with available experimental

data.

Abstract

Gravity currents have been studied numerically and experimentally
both in the laboratory and in the ocean. The question of appropriate
boundary conditions is still challenging for most complex ﬂows. Grav-
ity currents make no exception - appropriate, physically and mathe-
matically sound boundary conditions are yet to be found. This task is
further complicated by the technical limitations imposed by the current
oceanographic techniques.

In this paper, we make a ﬁrst step toward a better understanding
of the impact of boundary conditions on gravity currents. Speciﬁcally,
we use direct numerical simulations to investigate the eﬀect that the
popular Neumann, and less popular Dirichlet boundary conditions on
the bottom continental shelf have on the entrainment and transport of
gravity currents.

The ﬁnding is that gravity currents under these two diﬀerent bound-
ary conditions diﬀer most in the way they transport heat from the top
towards the bottom. This major diﬀerence occurs at medium temper-
ature ranges. Entrainment and transport at high temperatures also
show signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

1 Introduction

A gravity or density current is the ﬂow of one ﬂuid within another
caused by the temperature (density) diﬀerence between the ﬂuids [1].
Gravity currents ﬂowing down a sloping bottom that occur in the
oceans (e.g., those that ﬂow down the Strait of Gibraltar and the
Denmark Strait) are an important component of the thermohaline cir-
culation [2], which in turn is important in climate and weather studies.
Oceanic gravity currents have been studied in the past, both in
the laboratory and in the ocean. They have been modelled in various
ways, starting from the streamtube models, e.g., [3, 4] to more recent
non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations [5, 6, 7].

The question of appropriate boundary conditions for complex ﬂows,
such as the gravity currents we consider in this paper, is still challeng-
ing. This paper is a ﬁrst step in an eﬀort to bridge the gap between
observed gravity currents and the assumptions made in modeling them.
Using ocean observations to develop realistic boundary conditions for
gravity currents is limited by the available technological means. Thus,
the current boundary conditions used in the numerical simulation of
gravity currents are based on physical intuition and mathematical sim-
plicity and soundness.

The behavior of gravity currents under two diﬀerent types of bound-
ary conditions is studied in this paper. Speciﬁcally, the diﬀerences be-
tween gravity currents ﬂowing with Neumann (insulation) and Dirich-
let (ﬁxed-temperature) bottom boundary conditions are investigated
via direct numerical simulations. Quite possibly, other boundary con-
ditions, such as Robin, would be more appropriate. However, given
the popularity of Neumann [5, 8, 9, 10, 29] and, to a lesser extent,
Dirichlet boundary conditions in numerical studies [11], we decided to
focus ﬁrst on these two types of boundary conditions.

Bottom Neumann boundary conditions for temperature may be
assumed when the material on the continental shelf is a bad thermal-
conductor (i.e., the current ﬂows over “insulated” rock). Dirichlet
boundary conditions may be assumed when the material on the conti-
nental shelf is a good thermal-conductor, making temperature nearly
constant [12].

Dirichlet boundary conditions would be appropriate for the initial
transient development of gravity currents. For instance, it is known
that the Red Sea overﬂow shuts oﬀ in the summer [13]. Once this grav-
ity current starts again, one could expect the temperature diﬀerence
between the bottom layer and the overﬂow to have a transient impact
on the mixing near the bottom. Also, such a temperature gradient
could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the initial neutral buoyancy level, which is of
ultimate interest for large-scale ocean and climate studies. ¨Ozg¨okmen
et al. [14] found in numerical simulations that the neutral buoyancy

3

level did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from an analytical estimate, which
does not account for mixing, because the bottom layer properties were
isolated from vigorous mixing between the gravity current and the am-
bient ﬂuid, and yet determined the neutral buoyancy level. Thus, any
mechanism that can aﬀect the properties of near bottom ﬂuid is likely
to change the neutral buoyancy level, at least during the initial stages
of the development. This idea will be explored in a future study.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
mathematical model used in our numerical study. Section 3 presents
the numerical model used and the model conﬁguration and parameters.
Section 4 presents the velocity and temperature boundary and initial
conditions used in the numerical simulation. Section 5 presents the nu-
merical investigation of the eﬀect of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the bottom continental shelf on entrainment and trans-
port in gravity currents. Five diﬀerent metrics are used to this end.
Finally, Section 6 presents a summary of our ﬁndings and directions of
future research.

2 Mathematical Setting

Consider a two-dimensional gravity current ﬂowing downstream, with
x as the horizontal (downstream) direction, and z the vertical direction
(Fig. 1).

The momentum and continuity equations subject to the Boussinesq

approximation can be written as:

where (x, z) are the two spatial dimensions, t the time, (u, w) the two
velocity components, p the pressure, g = 9.81 m2s−1 the gravitational
acceleration, and νh and νv the viscosities in the horizontal and vertical
directions, here assumed to be constants. The way these viscosities
appear in the simulations is actually via their ratio, r = νv/νh.

One can argue that, at the horizontal scale being studied (10 km),
we may assume a constant horizontal viscosity, νh, since its control-
ling factors, model resolution and the speed of the gravity current (the
fastest signal in the system), do not warrant a variable horizontal vis-
cosity.

At the scale at which these experiments were conducted, which
is similar to that in ¨Ozg¨okmen and Chassignet [9], rotation is not

4

considered important either, i.e., vertical rigidity is not assumed [15].
In addition, it is also known that the vertical diﬀusion in the ocean
is small [16]. It is precisely the theory that vertical mixing between
gravity currents and the ambient ﬂuid is via eddy-induced mixing and
entrainment, not by diﬀusion, that led to the assumption that the
vertical viscosity may likewise be taken to be constant, and assumed
to be small, in fact. The ratio r = νv/νh is kept at r = 0.5 ∗ 10−3,
under the range that ¨Ozg¨okmen and Chassignet estimate the results
to be insensitive to the values of the vertical viscosity.

A linear equation of state is used

where ρ0 is the background water density, α the heat contraction co-

h is the Rayleigh number (the ratio of the
strengths of buoyancy and viscous forces), P r = νh/κh the Prandtl
number (the ratio of viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity), and r = νv/νh =
κv/κh the ratio of vertical and horizontal diﬀusivities and viscosities.
We consider 0 < r ≤ 1. This implies that the viscosity and dif-
fusivity in either direction are proportional, and both are small. This
is in line with the theory that diﬀusion plays only a small role in the
vertical mixing between gravity currents and the ambient ﬂuid, and
the mechanism is via eddy-induced mixing and entrainment.

3 Numerical setting

3.1 Numerical model

The ﬁrst consideration taken in passing from the mathematical to the
numerical model was the small amount of physical dissipation. This
calls for an accurate representation of the convective operator so that
the numerical dissipation and dispersion do not overwhelm the assumed
physical eﬀects.

Secondly, since small-scale structures are transported with minimal
physical dissipation, accurate long-time integration is required. Thus,
high-order methods in space and time are needed. The presence of
small-scale structures also implies a need for signiﬁcant spatial resolu-
tion in supercritical regions, which may be localized in space.

The numerical method implemented by Nek5000, the software used

in the simulations, is described below:

The spatial discretization of (6)–(9) is based on the spectral el-
ement method [17], a high-order weighted residual method based on
compatible velocity and pressure spaces that are free of spurious modes
Locally, the spectral element mesh is structured, with the solution,
data and geometry expressed as sums of Nth-order Lagrange polyno-
mials on tensor-products of Gauss or Gauss-Lobato quadrature points.
Globally, the mesh is an unstructured array of K deformed hexahedral
elements and can include geometrically nonconforming elements. Since
the solutions being sought are assumed to be smooth, this method is
expected to give exponential convergence with N, although it has only
C0 continuity. The convection operator exhibits minimal numerical
dissipation and dispersion, which is required in this study. The spec-
tral element method has been enhanced through the development of a
high-order ﬁlter that stabilizes the method for convection dominated
ﬂows but retains spectral accuracy [18].

The time advancement is based on second-order semi-implicit op-
erator splitting methods [19, 20]. The convective term is expressed as
a material derivative, and the resultant form is discretized via a stable
backward-diﬀerence formula.

Nek5000 uses an additive overlapping Schwarz method as a pre-
conditioner, as developed in the spectral element context by Fischer et
al. [21, 22]. This implementation features fast local solvers that exploit
the tensor-product form, and a parallel coarse-grid solver that scales
to 1000s of processors [23, 24].

3.2 Model conﬁguration and parameters

The model domain (see Fig. 1) is conﬁgured with a horizontal length
of Lx = 10 km. The depth of the water column ranges from 400 m at

6

x = 0 to H = 1000 m at x = 10 km over a constant slope. Hence the
slope angle is θ = 3.5◦, which is within the general range of oceanic
overﬂows, such as the Red Sea overﬂow entering the Tadjura Rift [5].
Numerical simulations were successfully carried out at a Prandtl

number P r = 7 and a Rayleigh number Ra = 320 × 106.

The numerical experiments were conducted on a Beowulf Linux
cluster consisting of 9 nodes with 1 Gbps ethernet connectivity. Each
node has dual Athlon 2 GHz processors with 1024 MB of memory.
The 2D simulations take approximately 72 hours (simulated to real
time ratio of ∼ 3).

4 Velocity and temperature boundary and
initial conditions

4.1 Temperature boundary conditions

Inlet
(x = 0; 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 1.0): The temperature gradient is one
of two agents driving the ﬂow, the other being the velocity boundary
conditions (see Section 4.2).

The Dirichlet (ﬁxed-temperature) boundary condition is assumed
at the inlet. This assumption is simple to work with, although its cor-
rectness ultimately depends on whether or not sea water is an excellent
thermal conductor [12]. The boundary condition

are used (see Fig. 2). Figure 2 shows the initial color-coded density
plot for temperature (red is lowest temperature, blue is highest).

Bottom (the continental shelf): This is the interface between the
gravity current and the continental shelf. The actual thermal conduc-
tivity of the continental shelf will suggest the proper boundary condi-
tion. Ockendon et al. [12] prescribe Dirichlet conditions if the boundary
(the continental shelf) is an excellent thermal conductor; Neumann if
the region outside of the gravity current (the continental shelf) is a
very bad thermal conductor; and Robin when the thermal ﬂux at the
boundary is proportional to the diﬀerence between the boundary tem-
perature and some ambient temperature. This last possibility was not
studied in this paper, but could be the topic of further study, in the

7

light of the results on incremental transport discussed later in this
paper.

Surveys of the literature have not clariﬁed the thermal conductivity
of the continental shelf. The continental shelf is in the neritic zone,
In
so it would contain a mixture of mineral and organic materials.
numerical simulations of gravity currents, the most popular choice is
Neumann boundary conditions [5, 8, 9, 10, 29]. Fewer numerical studies
employ Dirichlet boundary conditions [11]. Other boundary conditions
(such as Robin) might be more appropriate and should be investigated.
In this study, we focus on two diﬀerent sets of boundary conditions:
Neumann (∂T /∂n = 0), and Dirichlet (T = 1).

Dirichlet boundary conditions would be appropriate for the initial
transient development of gravity currents. For instance, it is known
that the Red Sea overﬂow shuts oﬀ in the summer [13]. Once this
gravity current is initiated again, one could expect the temperature
diﬀerence between the bottom layer and the overﬂow to have a tran-
sient impact on the mixing near the bottom. Also, such a temperature
gradient could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the initial neutral buoyancy level,
which is of ultimate interest for large-scale ocean and climate studies.
¨Ozg¨okmen et al. [14] found in numerical simulations that the neutral
buoyancy level did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from an analytical estimate,
which does not account for mixing, because the bottom layer proper-
ties were isolated from vigorous mixing between the gravity current
and the ambient ﬂuid, and yet determined the neutral buoyancy level.
Thus, any mechanism that can aﬀect the properties of near bottom
ﬂuid is likely to change the neutral buoyancy level, at least during the
initial stages of the development. This idea will be explored in a future
study.

For Dirichlet boundary conditions, a nondimensional temperature

of one was assumed.

Numerical experiments were conducted with shelf ﬁxed-temperature
values 0 ≤ T ≤ 1. T = 0 had the eﬀect of greatly speeding-up the grav-
ity current, and not allowing the head to form. Thus, the current could
not entrain ambient water at higher temperature values, contrary to
experimental and oceanic observations.

Outlet
(x = 10; 0 ≤ z ≤ 1): Note that the outlet is actually a
sea water to sea water interface, since the region of interest (10 km) is
only a small portion of the ocean’s breadth. The assumed boundary
condition here is insulation, i.e. ∂T /∂n = 0. (Another possible choice
is the “do-nothing” boundary conditions [25].) Since the outlet is far
away from the current for most of its journey down the continental
shelf, the choice of boundary conditions will not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly
our numerical results.

8

Top (z = 1): This is an air-sea water interface. Presently, insulation
(∂T /∂n = 0) is assumed. Since air is a bad thermal conductor, this
assumption is justiﬁed [12].

4.2 Velocity boundary conditions

Inlet
(x = 0; 0.6 ≤ z ≤ 1.0): Dirichlet velocity boundary conditions
are used at the inlet. The velocity proﬁle is given by an “S-shaped”
polynomial function. The inlet velocity proﬁle is one of the two forces
that drive the ﬂow, the other being the temperature gradient (see Sec-
tion 4.1 and Figure 3).

Bottom (the continental shelf): No-slip velocity boundary condi-
tions (u = 0, w = 0) were used on the bottom. Previous studies
on gravity currents by ¨Ozg¨okmen et al. [9, 5] assume no-slip velocity
boundary conditions on the continental shelf, which is one of the most
popular assumptions for ﬂuids ﬂowing over a solid boundary. Even in
their studies on gravity currents over complex topography [10], which
might constitute “roughness” and aﬀect the log layer, ¨Ozg¨okmen et
al. still used the no-slip assumption. One should note, however, that
the question of appropriate boundary conditions ﬂor ﬂuid ﬂows is still
an active area of research. Other (more appropriate) choices include
slip-with-friction boundary conditions [26, 27, 28]. Given the popular-
ity of Dirichlet boundary conditions in numerical studies of ﬂuid ﬂows,
however, we decided to focus on them ﬁrst.

Interestingly, H¨artel et al.

[29] performed experiments on gravity
currents at high Reynolds numbers for both slip and no-slip, and did
not observe qualitative changes in the ﬂow structure, although they
did observe quantitative Reynolds number eﬀects.

Outlet
(x = 10; 0 ≤ z ≤ 1): Free-slip velocity boundary condi-
tions (∂w/∂x = 0, ∂w/∂y = 0, ∂u/∂x = 0, ∂u/∂y = 0) were used
at the outlet. Another (more appropriate) choice is the “do-nothing”
boundary conditions [25]. Since the outlet is far away from the current
for most of its journey down the continental shelf, the choice of veloc-
ity boundary conditions will not inﬂuence signiﬁcantly our numerical
results.

Top (z = 1): Free-slip velocity boundary conditions were used, sim-
ilar to those used at the outlet.

Note that there are no boundary conditions imposed on pressure.
To handle this, Nek5000 uses an operator splitting method, which
initially uses a “guess for pressure”, corrects this guess (but veloc-
ity is now non-solenoidal), then corrects the velocity ﬁeld to impose

9

the divergence-free velocity ﬁeld. See Rempfer [30] for a discussion of
boundary conditions for pressure.

4.3 Velocity and temperature initial conditions

The initial velocity ﬁeld is plotted in Fig. 3. The model is entirely
driven by the velocity and temperature (Fig. 2) forcing functions at the
inlet boundary (x = 0), and the temperature gradient. The velocity
distribution at this boundary matches no-slip at the bottom and free-
slip at the top using fourth-order polynomials such that the depth
integrated mass ﬂux across this boundary is zero.

Other polynomials proﬁles may be assumed, but care must by taken

to ensure that

• the depth-integrated mass ﬂux across the boundary be zero;
• the assumed temperature proﬁle be consistent with the ﬂow re-

versal for the velocity boundary condition; and

• the amplitude of inﬂow velocity be time-dependent, and scaled
with the propagation of the gravity current, otherwise there will
be a recirculation at the inlet (in the case of over-estimation) or
a thinning-down of the gravity current as it ﬂows down-slope, in
the case of under-estimation.

These considerations on initial conditions were taken into account by
¨Ozg¨okmen et al. [9, 10].

5 Numerical results

Gravity currents evolving with two diﬀerent sets of boundary condi-
tions (Neumann/insulation and Dirichlet/ﬁxed temperature), are stud-
ied. Measurements were made of their entrainment, average temper-
ature, and the heat each transports from the top (warmer water) to-
wards the bottom (colder water).

Figure 4 shows the gravity current with Neumann boundary con-
ditions at 6375 seconds (real time). The head and secondary features
are very visible at this point. One can see the current entraining some
of the surrounding ﬂuid via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which is
the main mechanism for mixing in a non-rotating ﬂuid [9].

Figure 5 shows the gravity current with Dirichlet conditions, also at
6375 seconds. One can see a diﬀerence in the temperature distributions
of the two currents, and it is such diﬀerences that this study tries to
quantify.

The diﬀerences between the two currents are most notably in the
way they transport heat, and in the way they entrain ambient water.
In order to quantify the diﬀerences, ﬁve diﬀerent metrics are used

10

in Sections 5.1-5.5. These metrics allow a careful assessment of the
eﬀect of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the numerical
simulation of gravity currents.

5.1 Entrainment E(t)

This metric was earlier deﬁned by Morton et al. [31]. The equivalent
formulation of ¨Ozg¨okmen et al. [5] is used here:

E(t) =

h − ho
length

,

(10)

where h is the mean thickness of the current from a ﬁxed reference
point (which is set at 1.28 km), and ho is the mean thickness of the
tail. The length of the current is taken from the ﬁxed reference point
to the leading edge of the current. This metric gives us a sense of how
ambient water is entrained into the gravity current.

The tail thickness, ho, is calculated from the ﬂux volumes passing
through the ﬁxed reference point. The mean thickness, h, is calculated
from the total volume of the current, from the ﬁxed reference point
to the nose. The diﬀerence in volumes would be accounted for by the
ambient water entrained.

The ﬁnding here is that the Dirichlet (ﬁxed-temperature) bound-
ary condition causes greater entrainment than Neumann (insulated)
boundary condition, by about 14.21%, averaged over the entire travel
time down the slope. This is actually consistent with the weighted
temperature metrics (below), which say that the Neumann boundary
conditions yield a colder current.

The maximum diﬀerence in E(t) between the two currents occurs
after the head has began to break-down, at around 10,000 seconds
(actual time).

5.2 Velocity-weighted temperature

Similar to the passive scalar calculations of Baringer and Price [32],
the velocity-weighted temperature was calculated as

Tv(t) =

(T ∗ u · n) dz
(u · n) dz

,

R

(11)

R

where the integration is from the bottom of the current to its top
(and the current is understood as having nondimensional temperatures
0.0 ≤ T ≤ 0.8), n is the unit normal (in the x-direction), and “*”
denotes multiplication.
In this section, and in the remainder of the
paper, we use nondimensional temperatures.

The ﬁnding is that the Neumann boundary condition yields a cur-
rent that is 5.61% colder than the Dirichlet case, and the diﬀerence
increases almost linearly with time.

11

5.3 Mean Thickness-weighted Temperature

Analogous to the velocity-weighted temperature (11), the mean-thickness
weighted temperature is calculated as

Th(t) =

(T ∗ h) dx dz
h dx dz

,

R R

R R

(12)

where the limits of integration are the height (z-direction) and width
(x-direction) of the current (again, where 0.0 ≤ T ≤ 0.8), and “*”
denotes multiplication. This is another way of estimating the average
temperature for the gravity current at any given time.

Note that metric (12) uses the total volume, the same volume calcu-
lation that is used in calculating h (the mean thickness of the current).
Hence it is referred to as the mean thickness-weighted temperature.
On the other hand, the velocity-weighted temperature (11) uses the
ﬂux volumes instead of the total volume. These ﬂux volumes are what
is used in calculating ho (the thickness of the tail).

By using metric (12), we found that the Neumann boundary con-
ditions cause the current to be about 9.36% colder than the Dirichlet
case, slightly more signiﬁcant than the diﬀerence reported by met-
ric (11).

Figure 6 shows the diﬀerence in the mean thickness-weighted tem-
peratures. Just like in Section 5.2, Neumann boundary conditions al-
ways generate a colder current, and the diﬀerence between the average
temperatures increases linearly with time.

Both weighted-temperature metrics (11) and (12) give results con-

sistent with the ﬁnding for entrainment in Section 5.1.

5.4 Total heat transport

Figure 2 shows the initial temperature distribution for both currents.
The coldest (red) part is at the bottom, and the warmest (blue) part
at the top.

The total heat transport for each current was calculated as

R(t) =

(T ∗ u · n) dz

Z

(13)

at each time-step. R(t) is then normalized with the length of the
current at that time step.

The ﬁnding is that, on average, the current with Neumann bound-

ary conditions transports more than Dirichlet case, by 9.34%.

Figure 7 shows a dramatic rise in the diﬀerence in transport be-
tween the two currents at about 6840 seconds (roughly 1/3 of the way
down the domain); the head breaks down at roughly 10,000 seconds
(real time).

12

5.5 Incremental heat transport

In the same experiment, repeated calls to the ﬂux-volume calculations
are done, changing the reference temperature each time. This allows
the calculation of heat transport for diﬀerent reference temperatures.
The data in Section 5.4 came from the standard reference temper-
ature of 0.8, which means that only ﬂuid with nondimensional tem-
peratures less than or equal to 0.8 get into the calculation for R(t) in
equation (13) above.

Figure 8 shows the heat transport spectrum plotted for the cur-
rent with Neumann boundary conditions, at reference temperatures
0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1. Notice that temperature transport increases
as the reference temperatures increases. This is because the higher
the reference temperature, the greater the part of the current that it
encompasses. Indeed, the standard reference temperature of 0.8 en-
compasses all temperatures from 0.0 to 0.8. On the other hand, a
reference temperature of 0.7 encompasses only temperatures from 0.0
to 0.7. The Dirichlet boundary conditions give a similar spectrum.

The diﬀerence in thermal transport between reference temperatures
0.5 and 0.7 is calculated, and this gives an estimate of the way temper-
ature is transported from the top (warmest part) towards the bottom
(coolest part) of the current. This is equivalent to calculating R(t)
in equation (13) in the previous section, but only for nondimensional
temperatures 0.5 ≤ T ≤ 0.7.

The same calculation is repeated for the middle temperature range

(from 0.3 to 0.5) and low range (from 0.1 to 0.3).

The ﬁnding here is that, at the middle range, (from 0.3 to 0.5),
the Dirichlet case transports more by 28.63% (see Fig. 9). At the
high range (from 0.5 to 0.7), Dirichlet continues to transport more, by
11.59%, on average. However, at the low temperature range (from 0.1
to 0.3), Neumann boundary conditions now give a bigger transport,
by more than 7.37%. This suggests that there is a major diﬀerence in
the way the two currents transport at medium temperatures, and the
diﬀerence in the incremental transport increases almost linearly with
time.

6 Conclusions

Gravity currents with two types of boundary conditions on the bottom
continental shelf, Neumann (insulation) and Dirichlet (ﬁxed temper-
ature), were investigated. The major ﬁnding is that the incremental
temperature transport metric best diﬀerentiates the two currents.

It was noted that the eﬀect is most signiﬁcant at the medium
In

temperature range (0.3 - 0.5), where the diﬀerence was 28.63%.

this range, the current with Dirichlet boundary conditions transported
more heat.

The other ﬁndings (in order of greatest diﬀerences) are: The en-
trainment E(t) metric also diﬀerentiates the two currents signiﬁcantly,
showing that Dirichlet boundary conditions cause a current to entrain
by about 14.21% more. The incremental temperature transport at the
high temperature range showed that the Dirichlet case transports by
11.59% more. The mean thickness-weighted temperature showed that
Neumann boundary conditions yield a current that is by about 9.36%
colder. The transport at standard reference temperature showed that
the Neumann case transports by 9.34% more. The incremental trans-
port at the low temperature range showed that the Neumann boundary
conditions cause about 7.37% greater transport. Finally, the velocity-
weighted temperature showed that the Neumann case yields a current
that is by about 5.61% colder.

Thus, the observed temperature distribution of the gravity cur-
rent results from a complex interaction of temperature being trans-
ported from below, and ambient water being entrained from above.
The present study is just a ﬁrst step toward a better understanding
of this complex interaction. In particular, it is found that there can
be signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the entrainment and transport of gravity
currents when the most popular Neumann boundary conditions, or
the less popular Dirichlet boundary conditions are used on the bottom
continental shelf.

A better understanding of the impact of both velocity and tem-
perature boundary conditions on entrainment and transport in gravity
currents is needed.
In particular, slip-with-friction boundary condi-
tions for the velocity on the bottom continental shelf appear as a more
appropriate choice. Robin boundary conditions for the temperature
on the bottom should also be investigated. Diﬀerent outﬂow velocity
and temperature boundary conditions (such as “do-nothing”) could
also yield more physical results, essential in an accurate long time in-
tegration of the gravity current. All these issues will be investigated
in futures studies.

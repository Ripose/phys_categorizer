It was proposed before that single bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) may be caused by strong
electric ﬁelds occurring in water near the surface of collapsing gas bubbles because of the ﬂexoelectric
eﬀect involving polarization resulting from a gradient of pressure. Here we show that these ﬁelds can
indeed provoke dynamic electric breakdown in a micron-size region near the bubble and consider the
scenario of the SBSL. The scenario is: (i) at the last stage of incomplete collapse of the bubble, the
gradient of pressure in water near the bubble surface has such a value and a sign that the electric ﬁeld
arising from the ﬂexoelectric eﬀect exceeds the threshold ﬁeld of the dynamic electrical breakdown
of water and is directed to the bubble center; (ii) mobile electrons are generated because of thermal
ionization of water molecules near the bubble surface; (iii) these electrons are accelerated in ”cold”
water by the strong electric ﬁelds; (iv) these hot electrons transfer noble gas atoms dissolved in water
to high-energy excited states and optical transitions between these states produce SBSL UV ﬂashes
in the trasparency window of water; (v) the breakdown can be repeated several times and the power
and duration of the UV ﬂash are determined by the multiplicity of the breakdowns. The SBSL
spectrum is found to resemble a black-body spectrum where temperature is given by the eﬀective
temperature of the hot electrons. The pulse energy and some other characteristics of the SBSL are
found to be in agreement with the experimental data when realistic estimations are made.

I. INTRODUCTION

Sonoluminescence refers to the phenomenon of light emission during acoustic radiation of a liquid and is associated
with cavitation bubbles present in the liquid. The most controllable and promising experimental data were obtained
for single bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL): picosecond UV radiation of a single bubble pulsating in the ﬁeld of the
sound wave [1,2].

Though the case of a single pulsating bubble is, of course, much simpler than cavitation in general, it turns out that
the SBSL is a very complex phenomenon which still remains not completely understood. There is a vast literature
devoted to SBSL that was recently reviewed in Ref. [2]. Interest in this phenomenon is stimulated, on the one hand,
by the fact that in relatively simple and controllable experiments extraordinary conditions (ultra-high pressures,
temperatures, and ultra-short light ﬂashes) are realized at the ﬁnal stage of the bubble collapse; on the other hand,
it looks promising to use the SBSL to construct a source of ultraviolet ultra-short ﬂashes that is much cheaper than
lasers.

The highly involved hydrodynamics of bubble collapse has been addressed in many papers that are reviewed in Ref.
[2]. One of the most important problems to explain here is the very existence of stable pulsation of bubbles. Recently
a theory has been developed [3,4] which explains this regime in terms of the dissolved gas diﬀusion and chemical
reactions in the gas within the bubble. It has been shown that an accumulation of noble gas in the bubble takes place
during pulsation of the bubble and that in a stable situation the gas in the bubble consists, almost entirely, of noble
gas and, of course, of water vapor. These theoretical conclusions were supported by the experimental data of Ref. [5].
Another key problem in SBSL is the mechanism of the light emission. Many mechanisms have been proposed,
criticized, and reviewed to explain UV ﬂashes radiated by the collapsing bubble [2]. The most popular of the
suggested mechanisms are the adiabatic heating of the bubble gas [2,6,7], shock wave-Bremsstrahlung model [2,10–12],
and, recently proposed proton-tunneling radiation as a result of a phase transition in water at ultra-high pressure
[13]. A general feature of these mechanisms is that extraordinary conditions are needed which can only be realized,
if at all, at a very small bubble radius when the density of the bubble gas is close to the water density and both the

1

hydrodynamics of the bubble and the properties of the bubble content and the neighboring liquid are not known from
experiment but inferred from numerical simulations.

In this paper we show that the main characteristic features of SBSL can be explained even without making any
assumptions about the extraordinary conditions. We are far from saying that these extraordinary conditions are
not present in experiments. What we mean is that there is another mechanism of the SBSL which occurs in water
near the bubble surface but not in the bubble gas as has been assumed in the most popular models of SBSL [2].
Extraordinary conditions are not necessary for the operation of this mechanism even though it may well be the main
cause of UV radiation. The mechanism under consideration is based on the idea put forward in Ref. [14] that SBSL
occurs because of electric breakdown in strong electric ﬁelds arising near the bubble surface as a result of ﬂexoelectric
eﬀect, that is the eﬀect of polarization of water because of gradients of pressure [16]. Here we present a scenario
and estimations that show that within the hypothesis the main features of SBSL can be explained using relatively
moderate parameters, e.g., temperatures (5÷10)103K for the bubble gas [6], and the natural (expected) value of the
ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient of water [14].

Let us mention that Ref. [14] has left many questions to answer. The origin of the optical radiation of the bubble
remaines unexplained. The problem is that in the visible region pure water has very low levels of absorbtion and
radiation due to interband optical transition [17]. Moreover the breakdown scenario is far from being clear. The
mechanism of the breakdown in water (see, e.g., [18]) involves ”lucky electrons” whose acceleration in the electric ﬁeld
leads to development of an avalanche. At ambient temperature the concentration of free electrons in water is quite
negligible (the band gap is about 6.5 eV [17,18]) and it is impossible to ﬁnd a ”lucky electron” in a small volume near
the bubble surface, i.e.
in the region of high electric ﬁeld, during the short time of the existence of this ﬁeld. The
spectacular synchronization of the emission pulses [2,19] that in the case of breakdown appears, at least at ﬁrst sight,
to be hardly compatible with the fact that we are dealing with a probabilistic situation. In addition, the reference
to the Penning eﬀect to explain the role of the noble gases is not convincing because the ionization energy of the
metastable state is more than the band gap of water as distinct from the case of breakdown in gases where the Penning
eﬀect is pronounced.

In this paper we consider in more detail possible processes associated with the electric ﬁeld arising from the
ﬂexoelectric eﬀect near a bubble exhibiting SBSL. A common diﬃculty with theories of SBSL is that little is known
about the parameters of gas in the bubble when the bubble radius is near its minimum value. Consensus exists about
one point: it is far from being a gas, because the lowest limit of the radius is governed by the van der Waals repulsion
and the minimum volume of the bubble is close to the van der Waals hard core volume. The equations of state used
for these conditions are not reliable at present. This is a challenging and fundamental problem but it is beyond the
scope of this paper. What is now possible is to make order-of-magnitude estimations. That is why we shall ﬁrst
explain what values of relevant parameters are necessary for our scenario to be operative and then discuss whether
our assumptions about these parameters are realistic. We include the value of the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient of water
among these parameters as well. This coeﬃcient has not been measured, unfortunately, and we use its estimated
”natural” value but, from the other hand, the knowledge of its precise value would hardly be of decisive importance
because the bubble gas parameters are not known precisely.

Let us describe shortly the proposed scenario. At certain short time interval, τc ∼ 1ns, when the bubble radius is
near its minimum, the acceleration of the radius and, therefore, the pressure gradient, assume gigantic values [2] and
the sign of the pressure gradient is such as to create a strong (depolarizing) electric ﬁeld directed to the centre of the
bubble in a thin water layer, ∼ 1µm, near the bubble surface, because of the ﬂexoelctric eﬀect. What happens then is,
in eﬀect, screening of this depolarizing ﬁeld by free electrons. Indeed, during the same time interval the temperature
of the gas sharply increases up to at least several thousand K, which owing to thermal excitation of the bubble gas and
water in a thin layer near the bubble surface makes the concentration of free electrons appreciable. The free electrons
are accelerated by the strong ”ﬂexoelectric” ﬁeld up to energies suﬃcient to generate additional free electrons as a
result of the electric breakdown of water. The hot electrons also collide with noble gas atoms dissolved in water and
transfer them to higher energy excited states. Optical transitions from these states produce light radiation with a
broad spectrum whose shape is determined mainly by the energy distribution of the hot electrons. The latter has
the form of a Maxwell distribution with an eﬀective electron temperature which can be very high. This is due to the
fact that the noble gas atoms have a huge number of excited states with very high probabilities of optical transitions
between them (see, e.g., [20,21]). Since the radiation occurs in the region of very strong and inhomogeneous electric
ﬁelds the observed radiation spectrum is featureless. The characteristic time of the electric breakdown is much less
than the characteristic time for the last stage of the collapse τc, i.e. the polarization can continue to change after the
ﬁrst breakdown and the electric ﬁeld can reach the breakdown threshold value more than once. As a result, several
breakdowns can take place during the time interval τc. During each breakdown the noble gas atoms are excited. An
important speciﬁc feature of the noble gas atoms is the existence of long-living (metastable) excited states with a life
time of up to several milliseconds (see, e.g., [20,21]). Therefore, once excited the noble gas atom can remain in the
metastable state for the entire time interval τc ∼ 1ns, and, possibly, for many periods of the acoustic wave (the period

2

is about 30µs). That means that in the stationary state the longer is the pulse the more is its intensity.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.2 we discuss the ﬂexoelectric eﬀect in water in more detail than in [14]
and consider the sign of the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld, which is crucial for the proposed scenario, at diﬀerent stages of the
bubble collapse. The scenario of SBSL is presented in Sec.3 where the values of relevant parameters necessary for
realizing the scenario are estimated. In Sec.4 we discuss the energy distribution functions of hot electrons and the
breakdown conditions in strong ﬂexoelectric ﬁelds as well as the spectrum of SBSL. In Conclusions we summarize the
results of our theory, discuss their relation to the experimental data, speculate about some possible modiﬁcations of
the scenario and point out some problems to solve.

II. FLEXOELECTRIC EFFECT AND ELECTRIC FIELD NEAR THE BUBBLE

We have already mentioned that the proposed mechanism of SBSL is based on the ﬂexoelectric eﬀect, namely the
appearance of a polarization (electric ﬁeld) due to gradient of density (pressure) [14]. This eﬀect is not widely known
and it was discussed in [14] but shortly. Besides, the ﬂexoelectric coeﬁcients are still not determined experimentally
[15]. That is why we think it is worthwhile considering in more detail the appearance of electric ﬁeld due to ﬂexoelectric
eﬀect .

The ﬂexoelectric eﬀect is a particular case of a more general phenomenon: appearance of electrical polarization,
P,as a result of gradient of some scalar quantity, e.g., temperature, concentration of a component, mass density, ρ.
This eﬀect should take place in any substance [16]. As usual, the material equation can be written in several forms.
In particular, considering polarization as a function of dilatation, u = ∆ρ/ρ, and the electric ﬁeld, E, one has for an
isotropic medium

where χ is the electric susceptibility and α is one of the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcients. We shall be interested in the case of
spherical symmetry and the absence of free charges. In this case D = ε0E + P = 0. Then from Eq.1 it follows that

P=α∇u+ε0χE,

E = −

α

∇u = −

εε0

∇p ≡ f ∇p,

(2)

since u = βp, where p is the (excess) pressure, β is the compressibility.

To estimate the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcients it is convenient to consider separately two main mechanisms of polarization:
charge displacement and dipole ordering. We shall see that in both cases the coeﬃcient of proportionality between
polarization and gradient of pressure, f , has the same characteristic value.

The charge displacement polarization is realized, e.g., in ionic crystals. When a gradient of dilatation takes place
there are less and more compressed regions in each unit cell. The ions of larger radius tend to displace to the less
compressed region while ions of less radius displace into the opposite direction. Since cations and anions usually
have diﬀerent radii their displacements produce polarization. The coeﬃcient α can be estimated as follows [16].
The maximum (”atomic”) gradient of dilatation is equal to 1/d, where d is the interatomic distance.This gradient
has to produce ”atomic” polarization Pat ∼ e/d2, where e is the electron charge, when the electric ﬁeld is absent
(compensated by some charges), i.e. αion ∼ e/d . Then from Eq.2 it follows that

f ∼

αionβ

εε0

∼

eβ
dε0

(3)

where we have taken into account that ε ∼ 1 for ionic crystals.

We shall argue that the same estimation is aplicable for materials with dipole ordering. The dipole ordering
polarization in the absence of an external electric ﬁeld but under a gradient of pressure arises because of geometric
asymmetry of the molecular dipoles. For example, the geometric shape of water molecule is highly asymmetric: the
negatively charged end is much more compact than the positive one: the negative charge is concentrated in the oxygen
ion (O−−) while the positive charge is shared by two hydrogen ions (H+) located fairly far from each other. Under
a pressure gradient a water molecule tries to orient itself in such a way that the oxygen ion would be located in
the region of higher density while the hydrogens would be located in the region of lesser density. In other words, a
gradient of pressure leads to orientation of the water molecular dipoles. It is well known that polarization due to
dipole ordering is much more eﬀective than polarization due to charge displacements. This is reﬂected in the fact that
dielectric constants of dipolar materials are, normally, much larger than of non-polar materials. For the same reason
it is natural to estimate αdip ∼ εαion. Then from Eq.2 it follows that for water

(4)

where we have taken into accout that for water β ≈ 5 · 10−10 m2

N , d ∼ 10−10m.

For what follows the sign of the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcients is of importance. As it has been mentioned above the
negative tip of the water molecule, the oxygen ion, tends to be located in the region of higher pressure. This means
that the polarization vector is directed opposite to the gradient of pressure, i.e., the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient α is
negative and the coeﬃcient f is positive.

Let us mention that we rather underestimated the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient of water than overestimated. Indeed,
what we call αion is replaced, in fact, by αat deﬁning an ”atomic” ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient that is of the same order
of magnitude for all substances, i.e. it does not take into account speciﬁc features of the substance in question. It is
natural to expect that a substance consisting of molecules whose electric asymmetry (existence of a dipolar moment)
is accompanied by a pronounced geometric asymmetry (as it is for water) will exhibit a stronger ﬂexoelectric eﬀect
than that estimated above. However, while this coeﬃcient is not measured (reliable calculations seem much more
problematic than measurements) we shall assume the value given by Eq.4. On the contrary, the conclusion reached
about the sign of the coeﬃcient f , which is crucial for the mechanism discussed in this paper, seems much more
deﬁnite.

Above we have neglected the conductivity of water. This may seem questionable because the Debye radius of the
electric ﬁeld screening in water is comparable with the characteristic size of the strong ﬁeld region (∼ 1µm). However,
this neglection is justiﬁed because, as a rule, the dielectric relaxation time, τD, is much greater than τc ≃ 1ns, which is
the maximal characteristic time of the polarization change in our case. Increasing the ionic conductivity of water by
adding, for example, NaCl, one can, according to our estimations, decrease τD down to 0.1ns. In such an electrolyte
the mechanism of SBSL discussed in this paper might be less eﬀective.

III. THE SCENARIO: ESTIMATION OF THE MAIN PARAMETERS

The dynamics of bubble cavitation have been studied in many papers [2]. Here we will only discuss the short
time interval when the bubble radius R is close to its minimum value Rc (Fig.1a). Fig.1a reﬂects the most essential
features of Fig.4 of Ref. [8] and Fig.12 of Ref. [2] where experimental results were presented. Within this interval the
velocity of the bubble surface v = dR/dt reaches its maximum and reaches zero at the point R = Rc (Fig.1b) and
the acceleration a = d2R/dt2 reverses its sign and can achieve huge values (Fig.1c). During the negative acceleration
period (t ∼ t1, see Fig. 1c) the gradient of pressure ∇p = −ρa is directed from the bubble center to its periphery, thus
according to Eq.4 the ﬂexoelectric depolarizing ﬁeld has the same direction (Fig.1d). That means that free electrons
that could be generated in the gas or in water near the bubble surface cannot be accelerated. During the positive
acceleration period (t1 < t < t2, see Fig. 1e) the situation is opposite: the arising ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld is directed to
the bubble center and the generated electrons can be accelerated by the ﬁeld and produce a breakdown (Fig. 1e).
According to experimental data [8,9] for a bright SBSL the characteristic value of the acceleration is about (1011÷
1013) m/s2 during an interval, τc = t2 − t1 ∼ 1ns , so the pressure gradient ∇p = −ρa can reach (1014÷1016)N/m3.
Note that the gradient of pressure decays with distance from the bubble surface . For purpose of estimations one can
consider water as incompressible liquid where ∇p = (∇ps)R2/r2 where ∇ps is the gradient of pressure at the bubble
surface. The same estimation for the gradient of pressure can be obtained if we take into account that the pressure is
about (106÷108) N/m2 at the ﬁnal stage of the bubble collapse and the extension of the high pressure region is about
1µm [2].

It follows from Eqs.4 and 2 that for ∇p=(1014÷1016)N/m3 the value of the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld, E , can reach (107÷
109)V/m. According to Eq.4 the electric ﬁeld decays just as the gradient of pressure, i.e., the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld in water
is given by the formula E ≃ EsR2/r2 where Es is the ﬁeld at the bubble surface, i.e. the radial extension of the strong
ﬁeld region is about 1µm. The ﬁeld E can essentially exceed the threshold ﬁeld of dynamic electric breakdown of
water Eth which is about (1÷3)·108V/m [18]. It does not mean, however, that electric breakdown will occur: a ”lucky
electron” which capable of provoking an avalanche is needed. A similar situation takes place with the laser breakdown
[18]. At the same time the conduction electron concentration, n, in water at room temperature is practically zero
(n ∼ 10−90cm−3): water could be considered as a wide gap amorphous semiconductor with Eg ≃ 6.5eV [18,17,22–24].
The breakdown starts only the moment when the strong ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld is directed to the bubble center (Fig. 1f)
and conduction electrons appear because of the sharp increase of temperature near the bubble surface . The latter
takes place when the bubble radius R ≃ Rs which is close to Rc ≃(0.5÷1)µ. At this moment the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld
Ef may be much more greater than Eth so the coeﬃcient of avalanche multiplication of an electron can be practically
inﬁnite and in this case just several electrons are enough to provoke the breakdown and to screen the ﬁeld.

FIG. 1. Illustration of dynamics of the pulsating bubble and of formation of the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld and the electric breakdown
at the bubble collapse. Time dependence of the bubble radius (a), velocity (b) and acceleration (c) of the bubble surface. The
ﬂexoelectric polarization at diﬀerent moments: (d) - at the beginning of the collapse (t < t1), (e) - not very close to the turning
point, (f) - in the vicinity of the turning point (R = Rc).

Let us show that even relatively moderate temperatures near the bubble surface (which seem to be generally
acceptable for the regimes without the shock waves) are quite suﬃcient to provide a suﬃcient number of conduction
electrons to ensure the breakdown. As in Ref. [6] we assume that the gas has the temperature of 7000K. That means
that the water layer with a thickness of the thermal penetration length, δT , has a temperature of about 3000K. For
δT one has:

5

δT = (

2κ
ρc

t)1/2

(5)

where κ, the thermal conductivity of water is about 0.4 J/m s K; c, the speciﬁc heat, is about 4·103 J/m3 K; ρ, the
density, is 103kg/m3. Bearing in mind that the characteristic time for the last stage of the collapse is τc ∼1ns [2], one
ﬁnds that the thermal penetration length is δT ∼ 0.1µm. Following [17,18,24] we will consider water as an amorphous
semiconductor with a band gap Eg ≃ 6.5eV and an eﬀective density of states N ∗ ≃ 1021 for T ≃ 3000K. The
equilibrium concentration of conduction electrons in water at T ≥ 3000K is n = N ∗ exp(−Eg/2kT ) ≥ 3 · 1015cm−3.
Taking into account that the volume of the hot surface layer is approximately V ≃ 10−12 ÷ 10−13cm3 we ﬁnd that
the equilibrium number of conduction electrons in the layer is N > 300 ÷ 3000. It is important also to ﬁnd the time
needed for the equilibrium concentration of electrons to be established. The thermal ionization frequency (see, e.g.,
[25]) is

νT = (N ∗σvT ) exp(−Eg/2kT ),

(6)

where σ is the cross-section of the free carrier recombination, vT is the thermal velocity of conduction electrons in
water. Taking into account that a reasonable value of σ is about 10−15cm−2 and vT ∼ 107cm/s we ﬁnd from Eq.6
that for T > 3000K the transient time to the equilibrium τT = ν−1
T ≤ 10−8s. From that follows that during the
characteristic time for the last stage of the bubble collapse τc ∼1ns the number of conduction electrons in the layer,
N, exceeds 30 ÷ 300 electrons, which is quite enough to provoke breakdown.

Note that a similar number of free electrons can be generated by thermal ionization of the gas. Indeed, the assumed
gas temperature (7000K) is about two times larger and the ionization energy both of the water vapor and Ar, Kr,
Xe is about 12÷16eV, i.e. also about two times larger than Eg. Authors of many works (see [2] and the references
therein) state that much higher temperatures can be reached because of shock waves forming in the bubble gas during
the collapse. In principle, one can imagine a situation where high temperatures are not reached (and free electrons
are not generated) before the shock waves are formed. In this case the shock wave, when it explodes, will start the
electric breakdown.

As a result of breakdown the depolarizing ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld becomes screened. The total transmitted charge in the

process of the screening is

Qt = P S = 4πR2

sε0Es

(7)

where we have taken into account that in our case D = P + ε0E = 0, i.e., P = −ε0E. Assuming Rs ≃ 1µm and
Es = (108 ÷ 109) V/m we ﬁnd that the maximum total number of transmitted electrons is Nt = Qt/e ≃ (105 ÷ 106).
Note that for considered electric ﬁelds the time of the screening (breakdown), τs, is determined by the time it takes
for the conduction electrons to cross the region of the strong electric ﬁeld whose size is l ∼ Rs. Thus τs = l/vd
where vd is the electron drift velocity which in strong electric ﬁelds saturates at some value vd ≃ 105m/s (see Sec.4) .
Assuming l ∼ 1µm we ﬁnd τs ∼ 10ps. Note that the value of τs is less than the observed SBSL pulse width [2,26,27].
The whole period of positive acceleration, τc, (see Sec.3) is about two orders of magnitude larger than τb. Therefore,
after the breakdown is ﬁnished and the depolarization ﬁeld is screened the polarization continues to change, because
of change in acceleration. The electric ﬁeld arises once more and can exceed the breakdown threshold. As a result
a new breakdown will take place. Such a situation can be repeated several times. Eﬀectively, it manifests itself in
an increase of the pulse duration which may achieve a fraction of a nanosecond. Therefore, within our scenario the
greater is the pulse duration the greater is its energy. Analogous interrelation is observed in experiment. [2,26,27].

IV. ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF HOT ELECTRONS IN THE ELECTRIC FIELD AND SPECTRUM OF

THE SONOLUMINESCENCE

We have already mentioned that the electric ﬁelds under consideration are very strong, inhomogeneous and change
over time. However, the characteristic space and time scales of the ﬁeld change are correspondingly l ∼ 1µm and
τc ∼ 1ns and they are much more than the relaxation length λ and relaxation time τε of the hot electron energy
which are respectively about (10 ÷ 100)˚A and 10−13s. [17,18,24]. Therefore one can consider the local electron energy
distribution function using well known results for homogeneous static electric ﬁelds [28–30].

The considered electric ﬁelds are superstrong, i.e. the following condition is valid:

where ǫph is the characteristic energy of local oscillations in water which is practically equal to the energy of optical
phonons in ice, ǫph ≃ (80 ÷ 100)meV [17,18,24]. Using λ ≃ (10 ÷ 100)˚A one sees that the condition 8 is satisﬁed for

qEλ ≫ hωph ≡ εph,

(8)

6

ﬁelds E > 107V/m. The condition 8 means that in these ﬁelds an electron acquires, on average, an energy qEλ which
is much more than ǫph. Since in the process of the acceleration an electron generates many phonons the electron
energy distribution is nearly isotropic in the momentum space. Speciﬁcally, in this case the energy distribution of
hot conduction electrons is approximated with high accuracy, up to energies of electrical breakdown ǫ = Eg, by the
Maxwell function [28–30]:

f (ǫ) ∼ exp(−

From Eqs 12 and 13 as well from Eq. 8 one sees that vT /vdr = pkTe/εph = qEλ/εph >> 1. This is precisely the

condition of validity for the thermalization of the hot electrons and use of the Maxwell distribution.

Conduction electrons in water form polarons which are conventionally called hydrated electrons [22,24]. However,
in the strong electric ﬁeld the polaron states decay and the current carriers are the usual conduction electrons. For
purpose of estimation we assume that their eﬀective mass me is close to that of free electrons m0. Then from Eq.13 it
follows that vd ≃ 105m/s for ǫph ≃ 100meV. It has already been mentioned that the electric ﬁelds under consideration
are E ≃ (108 ÷ 109)V/m. It follows from Eq.14 that for such ﬁelds kTe ≃ (1 ÷ 10)eV, i.e., Te ≃ (104 ÷ 105)K for
λ ≃ (10 ÷ 100)˚A . One sees that the electron temperatures can be several orders higher than the gas temperature in
the bubble. Recall that for our scenario (see Sec.3) it suﬃcient that the gas temperature be about 7000K.

Now we will discuss the role of noble gases dissolved in water. An important feature of an noble gas atom is the
existence of metastable states. The life time of the metastable states can reach several milliseconds when the noble
gas atoms are impurities in solids (see, e.g., [20,21]). Since the nearest order in water is essentially the same as in
solids it would be natural to expect that the life-time of the metastable states for the noble gas atoms in water is not
less than 1ns . Hot electrons not only generate new conduction electrons (the breakdown avalanche) but also excite
the noble gas atoms into metastable states. Below we will estimate from the experimental data that the characteristic
value of kTe ≃ (2 ÷ 5)eV. However, a considerable number of electrons may have energies about 10eV and can excite
the noble gas atoms.

Note that the energies necessary for excitation to the metastable states, εm, for Xe, Kr, Ar, Ne, He are about
10eV and increase monotonically from Xe to He. In other words, it is much easier to excite Xe, Kr and Ar than Ne
and He. This could be the reason for the increase in SBSL intensity in the series He-Xe, which has been observed
experimentally [2,31].

As we have mentioned above, the life-time of the metastable states of noble gas atoms in water is expected to
be fairly long. Thus, once excited a noble gas atom can remain in a metastable state for the entire time interval of
positive acceleration and multiple breakdowns, τc ∼ 1ns. The major part of electrons has the energies ε < εm ,Eg;they
collide with these metastable atoms and transfer them to higher excited states. The radiation transitions between
high-energy excited states of noble gas atoms govern the SBSL spectrum.

Note that the life-time of the metastable states can exceed the period of the acoustic wave. In this case there will
be an eﬀect of accumulation of the noble gas atoms in metastable states resulting in the gradual build up of the SBSL
power during several periods of the acoustic wave.

A speciﬁc feature of a noble gas is an abundance of excited states with energies higher than those of metastable
states and with high probabilities of the radiation transitions between them. That is why the optical spectra of the
noble gas atoms contain many lines [20,21]. Because of the Stark eﬀect in the strong electric ﬁeld these lines are
split. Besides, in the active region the strong electric ﬁeld changes at least several times and the observed radiation
spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of the atoms in diﬀerent strong electric ﬁelds. In other words one can
consider the density of the atomic excited states as a constant.

The probability of a hot electron having an energy ε < Eg is given by Eq.9 and at every collision it transfers the
noble gas atom in a metastable state to a state with energy ε, the reference point of energy being the energy of the
metastable state (for our estimations we consider only one metastable state). The concentration of atoms excited
during the time of a single electric breakdown, i.e. the screening time, τs, to energies within an interval dε reads

where n∗
n is the number of the noble gas atoms in the metastable state, σex is the cross section of the impact excitation
of an atom from the metastable state to a state with energy ε. Atoms excited to states with the energy ε generally
do not go to the ground state directly but through intermediate excited states. It reasonable to assume that with a
high probability they radiate phonons with energy hν ≃ ε. So the spectral density of the SBSL radiation energy per

where kTes = (eEsλ)2/3εph and Nt is, practically, the total number of electrons participating in the breakdown. Note
that the approximative Eq.18 is not sensitive to the form of decay of the ﬁeld, it is important only that E decays
more steeply than r−1, i.e. it is not important that for ∇p we use an expression for an incompressible liquid.

The observed spectra are cut oﬀ in the shortwave region because of the absorption of water. This can be taken into
account by multiplying Eq.18 by exp(-α(hυ)L) where L is the size of the acoustic resonator (L ≃ 2.5cm [2]). Because
of the Urbach absorption tails [17,23] the radiation maximum is located considerably below than hν ≃ Eg ≃ 6.5eV .
It should be emphasized that the spectrum given by Eq.18 resembles the black-body spectrum but temperature
is given here by the eﬀective temperature Tes of hot electrons near the bubble surface. The value of Tes may
be much higher than the bubble gas temperature. Experimentally observed spectra can be ﬁtted, in the wavelength
interval (200÷700) nm, to the black-body ones with temperatures (2÷5)104K [2,33]. According to Eq.14 such electron
temperatures are reached at electric ﬁelds Es ≃ (2 ÷ 10)108 V/m for values of εph ≃ 0.1eV and λ ≃ (10 ÷ 100) ˚A
characteristic for water [18]. As follows from Eqs.4 and ∇p = −ρa such ﬁelds are realized at accelerations a ≃
(1013 ÷ 1014) m/s2. Similar accelerations are reported in [2,9].

Integrating Eq.18 multiplied by exp(-α(hυ)L) we ﬁnd an estimate of the radiation energy for a single breakdown

where hν is the characteristic photon energy which is close to the energy of the maximum of the observed spectrum,
which is about (5 ÷ 6)eV in the case of strong electric ﬁeld of our interest. Recall that in Eq.19 τs ≃ Rs/vd is the
screening (breakdown) time and Nt ≃ 4πR2
sε0Es/e is the number of transmitted electrons in the screening process
(Sec. 3) and n∗

n is the concentration of noble gas atoms in a metastable state near the bubble surface.

As we have mentioned before it was shown in [3,4] that because of dissolved gas diﬀusion and chemical reactions
an accumulation of noble gas in the bubble takes place while the bubble pulsates and in stationary conditions the

8

gas in the bubble consists almost entirely of noble gas. Therefore one can assume that the concentration of the noble
gas atoms, nn,near the bubble surface is close to its saturation value. Note that this value has to be estimated for
atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature rather than for the high pressures and temperatures existing at the
last stage of the collapse over a very short time. This is why we assume that nn ≃ (1018 − 1019) cm−3. Now we will
argue that the value of n∗
n can be only one order of magnitude less than nn. Indeed, for kTe ≃ (3 ÷ 5) eV obtained
above by ﬁtting the SBSL spectrum to the black-body spectrum, the number of electrons having an energy higher
than 10eV, Nh may be about 10−3 ÷ 10−2 of the total electron number Nt ≃ 106 i.e., Nh is about 103 ÷ 104. Such a
”superhot” electron excites a noble gas atom to the metastable state over the time τex = (σexvT nn)−1 ≃ 10−12s for
σex ≃ 10−15cm2, vT ≃ 106 m/s and nn ≃(1018 ÷ 1019) cm−3. Therefore a ”superhot” electron during its participation
in screening excites τs/τex noble gas atoms and the total number of the excited atoms is Nhτs/τex ≃ 104 ÷ 105 if one
takes into account that τs ≃ 10τex ≃ 10−11s. The total number of the noble gas atoms in the region of the strong
ﬁeld (∼1µm3) is about 106 ÷ 107, i.e. the percentage of the noble gas atoms excited to the metastable state during
a single breakdown can be about 10%. Since the life time of the metastable state is much more than τc and during
this time interval several breakdowns can take place (Sec.3), one may expect that the number of the noble gas atoms
excited to the metastable state during the interval τc is only one order of magnitude less than the total number of
n ∼ 1018 cm−3. If the life time of the metastable states exceeds the acoustic period (∼ 30µs) an
these atoms i.e. n∗
accumulation of noble gas atoms in the metastable states can also occur during several acoustic periods.

Now we can estimate the total radiation energy. We have mentioned above that the maximum value of Nt ≃ 106,
Rs ≃ 1µm, σex ≃ 10−15cm2 and vT >> vd. Taking into account that the positive acceleration period τc ∼ 1ns and
the breakdown time τs is about 0.01ns one can assume that the number of breakdowns is not less than 10. Thus one
ﬁnds from Eq.19 that the maximum photon number in the SBSL pulse can be more than 107. This value corresponds
to the maximum photon number observed experimentally [2,33,34]. Note that the radiation energy is a small part of
the total energy of the ﬂexoelectric ﬁeld (see Ref [35]).

V. CONCLUSIONS

Let us emphasize once more that within the mechanism of SBSL considered the main processes occur in water near
the bubble surface unlike the most widely discussed mechanisms of SBSL [2]. Within the framework of this mechanism
many experimental data about the SBSL can be explained quite naturally. Of course, since the parameters of the
collapsing bubble are not reliably known when the bubble radius is close to its minimum value we can present no
more than order-of-magnitude estimations.

Let us summarize the main results.
(i). The minimum duration of the SBSL ﬂash is determined by the single breakdown (screening) time, τs ≃ 10ps.
A larger time is possible because of the multiplicity of breakdowns. The maximum duration is limited by τc ∼ 1ns.
The longer is the duration the greater is the energy of the ﬂash. This is in agreement with experiments where it was
found that the pulse duration changes from 30ps to 400ps when its energy increases [2,26,27].

(ii). According to our estimations the maximum energy of the ﬂash corresponds to 107 ÷ 108 photons with energy

(5 ÷ 6)eV, which also agrees with the experiment [2,33,34].

(iii). Within our scenario the noble gas atoms play an important role. They do not reduce so much the breakdown
threshold as they govern the radiation process. Abundance of optical transitions in these atoms and inhomogeneous
broadening because of the Stark eﬀect explain the practically continuous character of the SBSL spectrum.

(iv).

In agreement with the experiment [2,33] the theoretical spectrum of the SBSL resembles the black-body
spectrum but the temperature is given here by the eﬀective temperature of the hot electrons which can be about
several eV, what corresponds to the observed apparent radiation temperature [2,33]. At the same time the gas
temperature is not directly related to the radiation temperature and can be considerably less than 1eV.

(v). The increase of inﬂuence on SBSL intensity in the noble gas series He-Xe observed in the experiment [2] is

connected with the decrease, in this series, of the energy of the lowest metastable state.

(vi). The pulse width does not depend on the spectral range of the radiated photons. This also agrees with

experiment [26].

(vii). The eﬀect of synchronization of the light pulses observed experimentally [2,19] is explained.
Note also that within our scenario of SBSL the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on SBSL is fairly weak. Their inﬂuence
becomes appreciable when they are high enough to hamper the heating of electrons [36]. This might be the reason
for the decrease of the SBSL intensity in strong magnetic ﬁelds which has been observed experimentally [37].

It seems that the considered mechanism of SBSL is especially eﬀective for water because of a lucky coincidence of

several conditions:

9

(i) the strong geometric asymmetry of the water molecule, which accompanies its electric asymmetry, provides
the needed sign of the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient. This sign is such that the electric ﬁeld has the ”correct direction”
(accelerates electron) over the same (very short) period in which electrons are generated because of the sharp increase
of the bubble gas temperature. The temporal coincidence of these two cicumstances is a possible reason of the eﬀect
of synchronization of the light pulses observed experimentally [2,19].

(ii) water is a semiconductor with a relatively narrow band gap (Eg = 6.5eV) and suﬃcienly wide conduction band,

what is necessary for the heating of the electrons in strong electric ﬁeld.

(iii) high solubility of noble gases in water what makes possible high concentrations of noble gas in water near the

bubble ﬁlled by the noble gas accumulated there in the process of the bubble pulsations.

Fulﬁllment of these conditions gives the answer to the question why water is the friendliest liquid for SBSL [2].
Some experimentally found characteristics of SBSL have not been explained in this paper, in particular the de-
pendence of the energy of the pulse upon the partial pressure of noble gases and water temperature [2]. These
dependences may be not necessarily a manifestation of the radiation processes studied in this paper but they could
be a consequence of a set of various factors. They may be determined by the hydrodynamics of the pulsating bubble,
the solubility of noble gases in water and also by the temperature dependence of the ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient of water
which still remains, unfortunately, unmeasured.

Although the main features of SBSL seem to be explainable within our scenario, these explanations are qualitative
rather than quantitative. We are still a long way from a quantitative theory at present. One of the main aims of the
paper is to stimulate some experiments that could either support or discard the proposed mechanis of SBSL.

(i) Measurements of ﬂexoelectric coeﬁcients of water.
(ii) A detailed study of radiation spectra at electric breakdown of water and ice with diﬀerent concentrations of

noble gases.

(iii) Study of inﬂuence of water conductivity on the SBSL intensity.
After performing these experiments it makes sense to develop the theory further. In particular, it will be necessary
to study in more detail the kinetics of the screening process and of the excitation of noble gas atoms while taking
into account the time variation of the distribution function of the hot electrons. This problem should be considered
together with that of the determination of the spatial distribution of excited noble gas atoms near the bubble surface.
Diﬀusion and relaxation of the excited atoms should be considered together, of course, with the processes that lead
to noble gas accumulation in the bubble [3,4].

In our estimations we assumed that ﬂexoelectric coeﬃcient of water has its ”natural” value. This was suﬃcient for
the theoretical estimations to be in agreement with the experimental data. In fact, because of the above-mentioned
strong geometric asymmetry of the water molecule, the coeﬃcient could be even larger. If this is the case some new
phenomena will take place including inﬂuence of the ﬂexoelectric eﬀect on hydrodynamics of the pulsating bubble
and X-ray radiation induced by electrons of very high energy.

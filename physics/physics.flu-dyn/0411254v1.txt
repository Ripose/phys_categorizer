Abstract

The phase “jumps” for solitons interacting on a vortex ﬁlament,
observed in experiments, have been unaccounted for since more than
twenty years. Using explicit formulas describing the interaction of two
solitons on a thin vortex ﬁlament in the Localized Induction Approx-
imation we show that an appropriate choice of the parameters of the
solitons leads to large phase shifts. This result does not depend on
the axial ﬂow along the ﬁlament.

It is well known that the equation describing the motion of a single thin
vortex ﬁlament in an ideal ﬂuid in the localized induction approximation
[1] is integrable in the sense of the soliton theory [2]) and admits soliton

that the equation itself has been derived as early as 1906 by da Rios and
then rediscovered few times, see [4]). However, the experiments carried out
some time later have shown that although some soliton-like patterns can be
observed and their qualitative behavior agrees with the theory ([5]) but there
are some discrepancies concerning quantitative details [6]. Let us mention the
ratio of the group velocity and the phase velocity, the dependence between
phase velocity, angular velocity and group velocity, and last but not least:
the very large “phase jump” during head-on collisions of two solitons [7, 8].
Then, the approximation has been improved by taking into account the
axial ﬂow (the ﬂow inside the vortex core, along the ﬁlament) [9]. The
kinematics of the vortex ﬁlament remained integrable but the equation is
now more general (it contains one additional free parameter corresponding
to the intensity and direction of the axial ﬂow) [9, 10]:

the vortex ﬁlament, ﬁnally α and β are assumed be constant (α > 0). The
case β = 0 corresponds to Localized Induction Equation of da Rios, closely
associated with the cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation and continuum
Heisenberg ferromagnt model (see [11]). The case α = 0 is associated with the
modiﬁed Korteweg-de Vries equation. Usually α, β are treated as parameters
of the theoretical model and they have to follow from experimental data.

The exact formulas for multi-soliton solutions can be obtained using dif-
ferent methods (compare [3, 9, 10, 12]. We follow the soliton surfaces ap-
proach [11, 13] as most convenient. The one-soliton solution is obtained
without diﬃculties [13, 14] but two-soliton solution looks much more com-
plicated (compare [12, 15]). An essential simpliﬁcation of the two-soliton
formula is given in [16, 17].

However, the following statement written more than 16 years ago seems
to be still accepted: “The shapes of the ‘Hasimoto soliton’ seem adequate to
ﬁt experimental data, but the ratio between group velocity and phase velocity
for the wave is a constant (2.0) in LIA, whereas the experiments show a
dependence on the ratio of wavelength to core size. Also unexplained is a

large phase advance on collision of two experimental ‘solitons’. An intriguing
attempt to go beyond LIA as originally conceived was presented by Fukumoto
& Miyazaki. Their proposal to include an arbitrary axial ﬂow (. . . ) leaves
the shapes of the solitons unchanged, changes the velocity of the propagation,
but, unfortunately, does nothing for the troublesome phase jump.” [6].

The main goal of the present paper is to show that the large phase jumps

are not longer “troublesome” and are in good agreement with the theory.

In order to describe the interaction of two solitons on a single vortex

(by the way: changing the function ω(λ) we get other equations of a large
hierarchy of integrable systems, compare [18]), λk are complex parameters,
and, ﬁnally, Qk0, Pk0, δ1, δ2, ∆ are real constants.

The constants Qk0, Pk0 are arbitrary but not very important, they just
ﬁx the initial positions of the solitons. The constants δ1, δ2, ∆ depend on λk

The two-soliton formula (2) is obtained in the framework of the soliton sur-
faces approach [16, 17]. Its form is relatively simple (especially when com-
pared with other, equivalent, formulas, see [9, 10, 14, 15]) and implies a lot
of interesting consequences. Formulas for N-soliton solution can be found
for instance in [18] (see also [9, 10, 17]).

Let us ﬁrst discuss the one-soliton solution (in the case ω(λ) =

Physical characteristics of the single soliton solution r1 can be computed
in the standard way. The amplitude of the Hasimoto vortex (i.e., its maximal
distance from the z-axis) is given simply by d1. The maximum of the wave
envelope (Q1 = 0) performs a helical movement and its z-coordinate (zmax1)
moves at a constant speed (group velocity vg

more important) the localized induction equation was successfully applied
yielding some patterns which can be observed experimentally ([20], compare
[21]).

The size of the lump soliton can be estimated by its half-width. The half-
width D1 is deﬁned as a diﬀerence between the two values of z corresponding

The shape and the velocity of the soliton do not change during the interac-
tion. The only result of the interaction is the phase shift. In fact we have
two phase shifts: the shift ∆ph
1 along e3 axis and the shift of the angular
variable P1. The ﬁrst one is much more important and can be measured in
experiments. Analogical considerations are valid in the limit Q1

Let us consider the case of the head-on collision of two solitons (this
case was observed in experiments [8]). We assume vg

on collision) and also bk > 0 (a technical assumption which can be made
without loss of the generality). We are going to compute the phase shift of
the ﬁrst soliton (indexed by 1) after the interaction with the second soliton.

To compute the phase velocity of a soliton we have to determine positions
of the individual wave peaks. Considering the projection of the soliton on the
xz-plane we have to solve (at least implicitly) the equation ∂

In the analysis of solitons on a vortex ﬁlament the phase velocity has been
always assumed to be constant suﬃciently far from the envelope maximum
(Qk
). However in experiments usually the central region of the kink
(i.e., Qk
0) can be studied with the best accuracy. Anyway, the theoretical
treatment of the phase velocity is relatively diﬃcult and have to be made with
care. Experimental results concerning the phase velocity are also “rather
crude” [7, 8].

To compare the presented theory with experimental results we recall
that the two-soliton solution is parameterized by only 4 essential param-
eters a1, b1, a2, b2 (the parameters Qk0, Pk0, related to initial data, are not
important for our analysis) and two more parameters (α, β) characterize the
physical model. In experiments one can measure more or less precisely much
more quantities: amplitudes (dk), torsions, velocities (vg
k, vph
k ), widths (Dk,
Λk), angular velocities (Ωk), phase shifts (∆ph
k and angular phase shifts) etc.
We choose dk and Dk (or Λk) as fundamental quantities. They can be
measured with reasonable accuracy. They are very convenient in theoretical
analysis beaucause from (8) we can express ck in terms of dk and Dk:

The experimental observations of the soliton interactions have shown that
“the forward advance (. . . ) is of the order of the central wavelength of the
isolated kink wave” ([8], compare Fig. 4). The analysis presented above is in
perfect agreement with this observation. For ˜∆
3 we have a very interesting
coincidence: the phase shift is equal to the halfwidth of the soliton.

≈

We stress a very important point: the formulas (12),(18) are valid for any
α, β. Therefore our conclusion does not depend on the parameters of the
physical model (provided that we conﬁne ourselves to the localized induc-
tion approximation (1), of course), actually we can take even more general
integrable equation described by an arbitrary function ω(λ).

We propose the following procedure of comparing the presented theory

sign (this sign is related to the sign of α, which in turn depends on the the
direction of the vorticity ﬁeld along the ﬁlament, we take α > 0 [8]). In any
case we can use (12) to choose right signs of ck. Then, we use (7) to compute
vg
1, vg
2. Thus we have a system of two linear algebraic equations for α and
β. The system is invariant with respect to the transformation: α

ck which means that an appropriate signs of ck yield α > 0. Finally,
having all six parameters, we may compare other quantities (e.g., rotation
rates and phase velocities of the solitons) with experiment. Some quantities
(e.g., phase shifts) need only 4 parameters to be computed (see above).

Konno and Ichikawa [10], trying to ﬁt their two-soliton solution to the ex-
perimental results of [8], explained very well amplitudes and group velocities
of both solitons, to some extent their widths, and also the angular velocity
and the phase velocity of one of the solitons (the corresponding experimental
data for the second soliton were not reported in [8]). We are able to explain
(with reasonable accuracy) the same data but also both phase shifts.

The agreement with experimental data is quite good (especially for the
ﬁrst soliton). Trying to get d2 closer to the value 0.49 we noticed an essential
decrease of ∆ph
2 or increase of Ω1. Taking d2 = 0.41 is a kind of compromise.
In this paper I revisited the Localized Induction Equation to show that, in
spite of popular views, that model explains interactions of solitons observed
in experiments including the existence of the large phase shifts. A little
bit surprising is that my result is equally true for the Localized Induction
Equation with and without axial ﬂow.

The theoretical investigation of the Localized Induction Equation, carried
out in many directions (compare [9, 10, 17, 22, 23, 24]), usually are not easy
to be used by experimentalists. I hope that the results of the present paper
enable much better analysis of existing experimental results (which seem to
be published only fragmentarily) and will prompt further experimental work
in this ﬁeld. Of special interest should be any observations of the interaction
of vortex solitons in the superﬂuid helium because such vortices are really
thin which is assumed in the localized induction approximation.

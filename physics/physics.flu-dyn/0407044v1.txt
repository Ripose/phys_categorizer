On-Shell Description of Stationary Flames∗

119899, Moscow, Russian Federation

The problem of non-perturbative description of stationary ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion
is considered. On the basis of the Thomson circulation theorem an implicit integral of the ﬂow
equations is constructed. With the help of this integral, a simple explicit expression for the vortex
mode of the burnt gas ﬂow near the ﬂame front is obtained. Furthermore, a dispersion relation
for the potential mode at the ﬂame front is written down, thus reducing the initial system of bulk
equations and jump conditions for the ﬂow variables to a set of integro-diﬀerential equations for
the ﬂame front position and the ﬂow velocity at the front. The developed approach is applied to
the case of zero-thickness ﬂames. An equation accounting the transfer processes in the ﬂame front
is also obtained. Finally, an asymptotic expansion of the derived equations is carried out in the
case θ → 1 where θ is the gas expansion coeﬃcient, and a single equation for the front position is
obtained in the ﬁrst post-Sivashinsky approximation. It is shown, in particular, how the well-known
problem of correct normalization of the front velocity is resolved in the new approach. Analytical
solutions of the new equation are found.

INTRODUCTION

The process of ﬂame propagation presents an extremely complicated mathematical problem. The governing equa-
tions include the nonlinear ﬂow equations for the fuel and the products of combustion, as well as the transport
equations governing the heat conduction and species diﬀusion inside the ﬂame front. Fortunately, in practice, an
inner ﬂame scale determined by the latter processes is large compared to the ﬂame front thickness, implying that the
ﬂame can be considered as a gasdynamic discontinuity. The initial problem is reduced thereby to a purely hydrody-
namic problem of determining the propagation of a surface of discontinuity in an incompressible ﬂuid, the laws of this
propagation given by the usual Navier-Stokes and continuity equations complemented by the jump conditions at the
surface, expressing the mass and momentum conservation across the ﬂame front. The asymptotic methods developed
in Refs. [1, 2, 3] allow one to express these conditions in the form of a power series with respect to the small ﬂame
front thickness.

Despite this considerable progress, however, a closed theoretical description of the ﬂame propagation is still lacking.
What is meant by the term “closed description” here is the description of ﬂame dynamics as dynamics of the ﬂow
variables on the ﬂame front surface. Reduction of the system of bulk equations and jump conditions, mentioned above,
to this “surface dynamics” implies solving the ﬂow equations for the fuel and the combustion products, satisfying
given boundary conditions and the jump conditions at the ﬂame front, and has only been carried out asymptotically
1, where θ is the gas expansion coeﬃcient deﬁned as the ratio of the fuel density and the density of

burnt matter [1, 4, 5, 6].

Diﬃculties encountered in trying to obtain a closed description of ﬂames are conditioned by the following two crucial

aspects:

(1) Characterized by the ﬂow velocities which are typically well below the speed of sound, deﬂagration represents
an essentially nonlocal process, in the sense that the ﬂame-induced gas ﬂows, both up- and downstream, strongly
aﬀect the ﬂame front structure itself. A seeding role in this reciprocal process is played by the Landau-Darrieus (LD)
instability of zero thickness ﬂames [7, 8]. A very important factor of non-locality of the ﬂame propagation is the
vorticity production in the ﬂame, which highly complicates the ﬂow structure downstream. In particular, the local
relation between pressure and velocity ﬁelds upstream, expressed by the Bernoulli equation, no longer holds for the
ﬂow variables downstream.

(2) Deﬂagration is a highly nonlinear process which requires an adequate non-perturba-

tive description of ﬂames with arbitrary values of the ﬂame front slope. As a result of development of the LD-instability,

corrugated. Characteristic size of the resulting ”cellular” structure is of the order of the cutoﬀ wavelength λc ∼
given by the linear theory of the LD-instability [3]; Lf is the ﬂame front thickness. The exponential growth of unstable
modes is ultimately suppressed by the nonlinear eﬀects. Since for arbitrary θ the governing equations do not contain
small parameters, it is clear that the LD-instability can only be suppressed by the nonlinear eﬀects if the latter are
not small, and therefore so is the ﬂame front slope.

The stabilizing role of the nonlinear eﬀects is best illustrated in the case of stationary ﬂame propagation. Numerical

of practical importance, however, have θ up to 10, and propagate in tubes much wider than λc. As a result of
development of the LD-instability, such ﬂames turn out to be highly curved, which leads to a noticeable increase
In connection with this, a natural question arises whether it is possible to develop a non-

perturbative approach to the ﬂame dynamics, closed in the sense mentioned above, which would be applicable to
ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion.

≤

A deeper root of this problem is the following dilemma: As was mentioned above, the ﬂame propagation is an
essentially non-local process; on the other hand, this non-locality itself is determined by the ﬂame front conﬁguration
and the structure of gas ﬂows near the front, so the question is whether an explicit bulk structure of the ﬂow
downstream is necessary in deriving an equation for the ﬂame front position. In other words, we look for an approach
that would provide a closed description of ﬂames more directly, without the need to solve the ﬂow equations explicitly.

−

The purpose of this paper is to develop such approach in the stationary case.
The paper is organized as follows. The ﬂow equations and related results needed in our investigation are displayed
in Sec. II A. A formal integral of the ﬂow equations is derived in Sec. II B on the basis of the Thomson circulation
theorem. With the help of this integral, an expression for the vortex mode of the burnt gas ﬂow near the ﬂame front
is obtained in Sec. III. To close the system of equations relating the ﬂow variables on the ﬂame front, potentiality
of the ﬂow upstream, and of the burnt gas ﬂow after extracting the vortex mode are to be expressed through the
values of the fuel velocity at the front. This is done in Sec. IV A 1 in the form of dispersion relations, using which we
obtain an equation relating the fuel velocity at the front and the front conﬁguration in Sec. IV A 2. Complemented
by the relation deﬁning the local burning rate (the evolution equation), the found equation provides description of
stationary ﬂames, which is closed in the above-mentioned sense. The developed approach is applied to the particular
case of zero-thickness ﬂames in Sec. IV B 1. Furthermore, it is shown in Sec. IV B 2 how eﬀects related to the ﬁnite
ﬂame front thickness can be taken into account in the obtained equation. Finally, the case of weak gas expansion is
considered in Sec. V, where a single equation for the ﬂame front position is obtained in the third order in (θ
1).
Analytical solutions of the latter equation are found in Sec. V B. The results obtained are discussed in Sec. VI. An
appendix contains a consistency check for the expression of the vortex mode, derived in Sec. III.

INTEGRAL REPRESENTATION OF FLOW DYNAMICS

As was mentioned in the point (1) of Introduction, an important factor of the ﬂow non-locality downstream is the
vorticity production in curved ﬂames, which highly complicates relations between the ﬂow variables. In the presence
of vorticity, pressure is expressed through the velocity ﬁeld by an integral relation, its kernel being the Green function
of the Laplace operator. It should be noted, however, that the jump condition for the pressure across the ﬂame front
only serves as the boundary condition for determining an appropriate Green function, being useless in other respects.
Thus, it is convenient to exclude pressure from our consideration from the very beginning. The basis for this is
provided by the well-known Thomson circulation theorem. Thus, we begin in Sec. II A with the standard formulation
of the problem of ﬂame propagation, and then construct a formal implicit solution of the ﬂow equations with the help
of this theorem in Sec. II B.

Let us consider a 2D stationary ﬂame propagating in an initially uniform premixed ideal ﬂuid. Let the Cartesian

As numerical experiments show, stationary ﬂames exist only in suﬃciently narrow tubes. Hence, assuming the tube

The ﬁrst two terms on the right of Eq. (9) represent the potential component of the ﬂuid velocity, while the third
corresponds to the vortex component. The aim of the subsequent calculation is to transform the latter to an integral
over the ﬂame front surface. To this end, we will decompose Σ into elementary ds as follows.

Let us take a couple of stream lines crossing the ﬂame front at points (η, f (η)) and (η + ∆η, f (η + ∆η)) (see Fig. 1).
Consider the gas elements moving between these lines, which cross the front between the time instants t = 0 and
t = ∆t. During this time interval, these elements ﬁll a space element Σ0 adjacent to the ﬂame front. For suﬃciently
small ∆η, ∆t, the volume of Σ0

adjacent to Σ0. Since the ﬂow is incompressible, Σ1 is of the same volume as Σ0. Continuing this, the space between
the two stream lines turns out to be divided into an inﬁnite sequence of Σ’s of the same volume, adjacent to each
other. Thus, summing over all ∆η, the third term in Eq. (9) can be written as

This representation of the ﬂow velocity downstream will be used in the next section to determine the structure of the
vortex mode near the ﬂame front.

III. STRUCTURE OF THE VORTEX MODE

To determine the ﬂame front dynamics, it is suﬃcient to know the ﬂow structure near the ﬂame front. As to the
ﬂow upstream, it is described by Eqs. (5), (6) for all ξ < f (η). Given the solution upstream, velocity components
of the burnt gas at the ﬂame front can be found from the jump conditions which express the mass and momentum
conservation across the front. On the other hand, these components are required to be the boundary values (for
ξ = f (η) + 0) of the velocity ﬁeld satisfying the ﬂow equations. As was shown in the preceding section, the latter can
be represented in the integral form, Eq. (12). Any velocity ﬁeld can be arbitrarily decomposed into a potential (vp
i )
and vortex (vv

i ) modes:

vi = vp

i + vv
i .

Our strategy below will be to use the integral representation to determine the near-the-front structure of the vortex
mode described by the last term in Eq. (12). As to vp
i , the condition of its potentiality, expressed in the form of a
“dispersion relation” at the ﬂame front, will eventually close the system of integro-diﬀerential equations at the front.
Equation (12) reveals the following important fact. Up to a potential, the value of the vortex mode at a given
point (η, ξ) of the ﬂow downstream is determined by only one point in the range of integration over (˜η, t), namely
that satisfying

H(˜η, t) = η , Ξ(˜η, t) = ξ .

(13)

This is, of course, a simple consequence of the Thomson theorem underlying the above derivation of Eq. (12). It can
be veriﬁed directly by calculating the rotor of the right hand side of Eq. (12): contracting this equation with εim∂m,
using εikεim = δkm, and taking into account relation

Now, let us take the observation point (ξ, η) suﬃciently close to the ﬂame front, i.e., ξ

f (η), [ξ > f (η)]. In view
of what has just been said, the vortex component for such points is determined by a contribution coming from the
integration over ˜η, t near the ﬂame front, which corresponds to small values of t. Integration over all other ˜η, t gives
rise to a potential contribution.

The small t contribution to the integral kernel K(η, ξ, ˜η) can be calculated exactly. For such t’s, one can write

It remains only to make the following comment in connection with the obtained expression for the vortex mode.
As is clear from its derivation, Eq. (26) is applicable to unbounded as well as bounded ﬂames. In the former case,
however, the improper integral on the right of this equation is undeﬁned, because integration over the inﬁnite “tails” of
the ﬂame front around the point satisfying Eq. (17) gives rise to a potential contribution which is formally divergent.

IV. CLOSED DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY FLAMES

After we have determined the near-the-front structure of the vortex component of the gas velocity downstream, we
can write down a closed system of equations governing the stationary ﬂame propagation. As was explained in the
Introduction, the term “closed” means that these equations relate only quantities deﬁned on the ﬂame front surface,
without any reference to the ﬂow dynamics in the bulk. This system consists of the jump conditions for the velocity
components at the front, and the so-called evolution equation that gives the local normal fuel velocity at the front as
a function of the front curvature. These equations (except for the evolution equation) are consequences of the mass
and momentum conservation across the ﬂame front. In Sec. IV A, we obtain a closed system in the most general
form, without specifying the form of the jump conditions, and then apply it to the case of zero thickness ﬂames in
Sec. IV B 1.

First of all, we need to ﬁnd the “on-shell” expression for the vortex component, i.e. its limiting form for ξ

f (η)+0.

For this purpose we note that in this limit, χ(εikrivk+)

In every ﬁnite order of the asymptotic expansion with respect to the ﬂame front thickness, the jumps [vi] (as well as

their values and the values of their derivatives of ﬁnite order in a given point). Two equations (29), together with
Eq. (6) and the evolution equation, vn

Given a velocity ﬁeld vp

according to

These relations imply that the combination Φ = ψ + iφ is an analytical function of the complex variable z = η + iξ,

vortex mode, we have been systematically omitting potential contributions. By the construction, these contributions
are proportional to the integral kernel of the Laplace operator [Cf. Eq. (12)], and therefore, they are generally diverge
logarithmically at inﬁnity [as, for instance, the last term in the expression (24)]. Hence, the integral over the part
Λ(cid:31)F of the boundary of Σ in Eq. (32) is formally an inﬁnite constant, while the improper integral over F is undeﬁned.

position in the limit of inﬁnite front length. In both cases, the ﬁnite constant in this equation (an integration constant

closed description of stationary ﬂames.

B. Equation (41) in lowest orders of the ε-expansion

In this section, the general results obtained in the preceding section will be applied to thin ﬂames in the ﬁrst two

orders of the asymptotic expansion with respect to the ﬂame front thickness ε = Lf /R.

For zero-thickness ﬂames, the jump conditions for the velocity components have the form

be done directly using the ﬂow equations (2),(3), see Ref. [2]. With the help of Eqs. (5.32) and (6.15) of Ref. [2], the

Equations (52) and (55) provide the closed description of stationary zero-thickness ﬂames in the most convenient

side of this equation to O(ε). This modiﬁcation will be considered in the next section.

2. Account of the transport processes in the linear approximation

An equation relating ω− with f can be obtained also in the case of ﬂames of nonzero thickness following the lines
of the above derivation of Eq. (55). For instance, in the ﬁrst order in the ﬂame front thickness ε, one has to use in the
general Eq. (41) the jump conditions and the evolution equation derived in Ref. [2]. The resulting equation turns out
to be much more complicated than Eq. (55). However, the main purpose of taking into account the inner structure
of the ﬂame front is to provide a short wavelength cutoﬀ for unstable ﬂame perturbations, which is necessary for the
very existence of stationary conﬁgurations of curved ﬂames. On the other hand, for many purposes it is suﬃcient
to consider the transport processes in the linear approximation, while full account of the nonlinear coupling of these
processes to ﬂame hydrodynamics is of minor importance in practice. Therefore, we can generalize Eq. (55) to the
case of ﬂames of nonzero thickness almost without calculation using the results of the linear theory of ﬂame front
instability. In the linear approximation, ω− = 1, hence, the left hand side of Eq. (55) reduces to

We have written ˆH instead of ˆH on the right of this equation in order to formally preserve the dispersion relation
(44). However, it should be kept in mind that by the construction, the ε-term is to be treated linearized.

Most probably, Eq. (56) can be solved in full generality only numerically. However, it admits analytical solutions

in lowest orders of the asymptotic expansion for θ

1, considered below.

the right hand side of Eq. (56)].

V. THE SMALL (θ − 1) EXPANSION

13

Although our main concern in this paper is the non-perturbative description of ﬂames with arbitrary θ, it is of
some interest to apply the above results to the case of weak gas expansion. The one reason is that this case allows
considerable simpliﬁcation of Eqs. (52), (56) which can be reduced to a single equation for the ﬂame position. The
other is that this is a good place to illustrate the role of the relation (39) in our approach. A well-known problem
of the analytical theory of nonlinear ﬂame propagation is that none of the modiﬁcations of the Sivashinsky equation
[1], derived from the ﬁrst principles so far, satisfy this obvious criterion. To avoid this problem, some authors found
it necessary to introduce suitable “counterterms” into these equations “by hands” in order to enforce fulﬁllment of
Eq. (39).

In the present formulation, this problem does not arise at all. To see this, it is suﬃcient to note that the constant
V does not appear neither in Eq. (56), nor in the evolution equation (52). Therefore, Eq. (39) is to be considered
simply as a relation that allows one to express the ﬂame velocity through the constant of integration C [Cf. discussion
in the end of Sec. IV A 1]. In lowest orders of the small (θ
1) expansion, this connection between V and C can be
followed out in detail.

−

A. The third order equation for the ﬂame front position

The form of the ε-term in Eq. (56) shows that the cutoﬀ wavelength λc ∼

1. This implies that
f ′ = O(α), and that diﬀerentiation of a ﬂow variable with respect to η increases its order by one. Furthermore, it
follows from Eq. (52) that u− = 1 + O(α2), since V = O(α2). Then Eq. (6) tells us that also w− = O(α2). To carry
out expansion of Eq. (56), we need also to ﬁnd the asymptotic action of the operator ˆH. Below we will limit ourselves
by the third order in α, i.e., the next to that of the Sivashinsky equation [1]. In this approximation, expression in the
curly brackets on the left hand side of Eq. (56) turns out to be a total derivative, so it is suﬃcient to write

be solved analytically using the method of pole decomposition [10, 11]. We look for a 2b-periodic solution of Eq. (60)
in the form

f (η) = a

ln sin

2P

Xk=1

2b

(η

The amplitude a and the complex poles ηk, k = 1, ..., 2P are to be determined substituting this anzats into Eq. (60).
Since the function f (η) is real for real η, the poles come in conjugate pairs; P is the number of the pole pairs.

Using the formulas (see Refs. [10, 11] for more detail)

3 Another way to show that C2 = 0 is to recall that no terms of the form C2f ′ appear in the linear equation for the ﬂame front position.

However, we prefer the reasoning given in the text, because it avoids referring back to the linear theory.

It is seen from Eq. (62) that the found solution (61) is not unique: there is a number of solutions corresponding to
diﬀerent numbers P of poles. To identify the physical ones, a stability analysis of the solutions is required which, of
course, cannot be carried out in the framework of the stationary theory. However, as we have mentioned above, the
functional structure of Eq. (60) is very similar to that of the stationary Sivashinsky equation. Under assumption that
the non-stationary versions of these equations are also similar, the stability analysis of Refs. [12] – [14] will be carried
over the present case. According to this analysis, for a given (suﬃciently small) b, there is only one (neutrally) stable
solution. This solution is identiﬁed as that maximizing the ﬂame velocity. In addition to that, the poles of the stable
solution are required to be vertically aligned in the complex η-plane. For such a ”coalescent” solution, a simple upper
bound on the number of poles can be obtained from Eq. (63). Namely, for k = k0 with ηk0 uppermost, one has

(The equality holds, if Im ηk0 =

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

15

(64)

(65)

The results of Sec. IV solve the problem of closed description of stationary ﬂames. The complex Eq. (41) determines
the on-shell distribution of the fuel velocity as a functional of the ﬂame front conﬁguration, while the evolution
equation plays the role of a consistency condition which gives an equation for the front position itself. We have
shown, furthermore, that in the case of zero-thickness ﬂames, the main Eq. (41) takes the form (55). This equation
is universal in that any surface of discontinuity, propagating in an ideal incompressible ﬂuid, is described by Eq. (55)
whatever internal structure of this discontinuity be. The latter shows itself in the O(ε)-corrections to this equation,
where ε is the relative thickness of discontinuity. A simple comparison with the results of Ref. [3] has shown that the
linear account of the heat conduction - species diﬀusion processes in the ﬂame front modiﬁes Eq. (55) to (56).

Next, some technical remarks are in order. It is diﬃcult to say at the moment whether Eq. (56) admits further
simpliﬁcation. What can be said, on the other hand, is that its analytical structure does not present insuperable
problems for numerical integration. Indeed, the keystone of this structure is the integral operator ˆH. But its properties
are much like those of the Hilbert operator ˆH which is well-known how to work with. From the theoretical point of
view, Eq. (56) is convenient for constructing various approximate descriptions of stationary ﬂames. In particular, it
servers as a regular basis for developing the small (θ
1) expansion which we considered in Sec. V. Application of
this equation to investigation of the opposite case of large ﬂame velocity will be published elsewhere.

−

Finally, it is worth to compare the results obtained in this paper and in Refs. [5, 6] where an equation describing
stationary ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion was derived under assumption that there exists a local relation between
the pressure ﬁeld and a potential mode of the velocity downstream, expressed by the Bernoulli-type equation.4 This
assumption was proved in Refs. [5, 6] in the framework of the asymptotic expansion with respect to (θ
1) up to
the sixth order, and as a result Eq. (40) of Ref. [6] was obtained. The third order equation (60) of the present
paper is indeed an integral of the fourth order approximation to Eq. (40) of Ref. [6]. However, comparison of the
latter equation with Eq. (55) in the large ﬂame velocity limit shows that this assumption is generally wrong. In this
connection, it is worth to recall that as we saw in Sec. II B, the use of the Thomson theorem makes investigation of
the pressure-velocity relation irrelevant to the purpose of deriving equation for the ﬂame front position.

−

4 This assumption goes back to the work [15] where it was introduced in investigating the nonlinear development of the LD-instability.

The results presented in this paper resolve the dilemma stated in the Introduction in the case of 2D stationary
ﬂames. Since in our considerations we have extensively used speciﬁcally 2D mathematical tools, the question of
principle is whether results of this paper can be carried to the 3D case, and further to the general non-stationary case.

APPENDIX A: CONSISTENCY CHECK FOR EQ. (26)

After a lengthy calculation in Sec. III, we obtained the following simple expression for the vorticity mode near the

ﬂame front

As this important formula plays the central role in our investigation, a simple consistency check will be performed
here, namely, we will verify that vv

i given by Eq. (A1) satisﬁes

Contracting Eq. (A1) with εki∂k, and using relation (35), one ﬁnds

The argument of the δ-function turns into zero when the vectors ri and vi+ are parallel. Near this point, one can
write

where φ is the angle between the two vectors. On the other hand, the line element, dl, near the same point can be
written as

as a simple geometric consideration shows, see Fig. 2.

Substituting these expressions into Eq. (A3), and taking into account relation

It should be noted in this respect that the identity Eq. (A2) is only a necessary condition imposed on the ﬁeld vv
i .
Playing the role of a “boundary condition” for the vortex mode, Eq. (A2) is satisﬁed by inﬁnitely many essentially
diﬀerent ﬁelds, i.e., ﬁelds which are not equal up to a potential. It is not diﬃcult to verify, for instance, that the
velocity ﬁeld deﬁned by

In our previous papers we proposed a continuum model for the
dynamics of the systems of self-propelling particles with conservative
kinematic constraints on the velocities. We have determined a class of
stationary solutions of this hydrodynamic model and have shown that
two types of stationary ﬂow, linear and radially symmetric (vortical)
ﬂow, are possible. In this paper we consider the stability properties of
these stationary ﬂows. We show, using a linear stability analysis, that

velocity and density perturbations. A similar analysis of the stability
of the vortical solution is found to be not conclusive.

1 Introduction

The dynamics of the systems of self-propelling particles (SPP) is of a great
interest for physicists as well as for biologists because of the complex and
fascinating phenomenon of the emergence of the ordered motion. In nature
these systems are represented by ﬂocks of birds, schools of ﬁshes, groups of
[1]-[3]. From the physical point of view many aspects of the
bacteria etc.
observed non-equilibrium phase transition from disordered to ordered motion
are to a large extent still an open problem.

The ﬁrst numerical model simulating the behavior of the SPP was pro-
posed by T. Vicsek at al.
[4]. Their model is based on a kinematic rule
imposed on the orientations of the velocities of the self-propelling particles.
At a low noise amplitude and a high density it was shown that the system
undergoes the transition from the disordered state to coherent motion. The
nature of the transition is not established yet. T. Vicsek’s investigation shows
that the occurring transition is of the second order. Several extensions of T.
Vicsek’s model have been proposed, which consider particles with varying ve-
locities, diﬀerent types of noise, and including external force ﬁelds and/or in-
terparticle attractive and repulsive forces [5]-[7]. The simulations performed
in [7] show the discontinuous nature of the transition in the T.Vicsek’s model.
Properties of T. Vicsek’s model were also investigated analytically. In [8]
the spontaneous emergence of ordered motion has been studied in terms of
so-called control laws, using graph theory. Generalizations of the control laws
were considered in [9, 10]. In [10] it was shown that the organized motion
of SPP with the control laws depending on the relative orientations of the
velocities and relative spacing, can be of two types only: parallel and circular
motion. The stability properties of these discrete updating rules (including
the T.Vicsek’s model) and the dynamics they describe were considered using
Lyapunov theory in [8, 9, 11].

In our ﬁrst paper [12] we constructed a hydrodynamic model for the
system of self-propelling particles with conservative kinematic constraints,
which can be considered as a continuum analogue of the discrete dynamic
automaton proposed by T. Vicsek et al.

Based on the conservation of the kinetic energy and the number of parti-

cles our model is represented by the following equations:

(1)

dv (r, t)
dt

= ω (r, t) × v (r, t) ,

∂n
∂t

+ ∇ · (n (r, t) v (r, t)) = 0,

where v (r, t) and n (r, t) are the velocity and the density ﬁelds respectively
and ω (r, t) is an angular velocity ﬁeld which takes into account the non-
potential character of the interactions between the particles. We modeled
this ﬁeld as follows:

ω (r, t) =

K1 (r − r′) n (r′, t) rot v (r′, t) dr′ +

Z

Z

K2 (r − r′) ∇n (r′, t) × v (r′, t) dr′,

where K1,2 (r − r′) are the averaging kernels. In particular we considered a
simple case of averaging kernels:

Ki (r − r′) = si δ (r − r′) , where

i = 1 or 2.

We call this the local hydrodynamic model (LHM). In this case Eq. (3)
reduces to

ω (r, t) = s1 n (r, t) rot v (r, t) + s2∇n (r, t) × v (r, t) ,

where

si =

Ki (r) dr.

Z

In our second article [13] we have shown that the only regimes of the station-
ary planar motion in our model are either of translational or axial symmetry.
In this respect our continuum model gives results similar with those obtained
in the discrete model of T.Vicsek [4, 5].

In this paper we investigate the stability of the obtained regimes of motion
In the next section we consider the
with respect to small perturbations.
stability of the planar stationary linear ﬂow with respect to the velocity
perturbation directed along the stationary ﬂow and perpendicular to the
ﬂow. We show that in both cases the evolution of the perturbations has

3

an oscillatory behavior, which means that they neither grow nor decay with
time. This can be interpreted as neutral stability [14] of the corresponding
stationary ﬂow. Also the external pressure term −∇p/n can be included into
Eq. (1) in order to account for potential external forces. In such a case with
s2 = 0 there exists the special case of the incompressible ﬂows, n = const,
when the equations of motion coincide with that for potential ﬂow of ideal
ﬂuids. As is known [14] such motion in 2D geometry is stable in the Lyapunov
sense.

In the third section we consider the stability of the planar stationary
radially symmetric (vortical) motion of SPP with constant velocity and the
density. We ﬁnd that in this case the linear analysis does not lead to a
conclusive answer about the stability of the solution.

2 Stability of planar stationary linear ﬂow in

the local hydrodynamic model

2.1 Stability with respect to a velocity perturbation

along the ﬂow

In this section we consider the stability properties of planar stationary linear
ﬂow for the local hydrodynamic model with s2 = 0, which we further call
local hydrodynamic model 1 (LHM1). At the end of the section we will
shortly discuss how these results extend to the local hydrodynamic models
with s1 = 0 and s1 = s2. For LHM1 the stationary linear ﬂow is given by

v0 (r) = v0 ex

and n0 (r) = n0,

(7)

where v0 and n0 are constants.
We consider velocity and the density perturbations of the following form:

v1 (r, t) = v0 A|| ei k·r eα||t ex

and

n1 (r, t) = n0 B|| ei k·r eα||t,

(8)

The velocity perturbation chosen is directed along the stationary linear ﬂow.
Here A||, B|| are constants, k = kxex + kyey is the wave vector and α|| is an
exponent, which determines the time evolution of the perturbation.

Substituting the solution v (r, t) = v0 + v1 (r, t) , n (r, t) = n0 + n1 (r, t)

4

into Eqs. (1)-(2) we obtain the linearized system of equations:

∂v1
∂t

+ (v0 · ∇) v1 = s1 n0 (rot v1) × v0,

∂n1
∂t

+ ∇ · (n0v1) + ∇ · (n1v0) = 0.

For the perturbation (8) this system reduces to

∂v1

α|| = −ikxv0

α|| = −ikxv0 (cid:0)

A|| + B||
B||

.

(cid:1)

Using Eq. (8) one may obtain the relation between α|| and the wave number.
From Eq. (11) it follows that

whereas from the linearized continuity equation (13) we have

Both the equalities are satisﬁed only in the case when A|| = 0.

Thus, in the linear stability analysis with respect to small deviations of

the velocity and density ﬁelds, we obtain the following perturbed solution

v = v0 ex, n = n0

1 + B|| eikyy eikx(x−v0t)

.

Taking the real part of the density perturbation we have

v = v0 ex, n = n0

1 + B|| cos (k · r − kxv0t)

.

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

The corresponding density ﬁeld is shown on Fig1.
This ﬂow Eq. (16) should satisfy the linearized system of the constraints
(conservation of the kinetic energy and the number of particles) which are

ditions must be fulﬁlled:

If one integrates Eq. 19 over the period of the integrand, one may can that
this condition is fulﬁlled.

The obtained perturbed ﬂow is an oscillatory ﬁeld (perturbation oscillates
with a frequency α|| as t → ∞) which means that the corresponding station-
ary solution is neither stable nor unstable within the ﬁrst order perturbation
theory.
In other words we may conclude that in our local hydrodynamic
model the stationary linear ﬂow is neutrally stable with respect to a small
density ﬁeld perturbations.

The stability analysis of the other possible hydrodynamic models with

s1 = 0 or s1 = s2 gives qualitatively similar result.

2.2 Stability with respect to a velocity perturbation

perpendicular to the ﬂow

In this section we investigate the stability properties of the stationary linear
ﬂow in the LHM1, Eq. (7), with respect to a velocity perturbation normal
to the stationary ﬂow. We consider only a velocity perturbation, which we
take in the form of a plane wave:

v1 = v0 A⊥ eik·reα⊥tey, n1 = 0,

(20)

where A⊥ is a constant, k is a wave vector and the exponent α⊥ describes
the time evolution of the perturbation.

Substituting the perturbation in the linearised equations (9)-(10) it fol-

lows that

∂v1
∂t

+ v0 (1 − s1n0)

= 0,

∂v1
∂x
∂v1
∂y

= 0 and ky = 0,

which imply that

α⊥ = ikxv0 (s1n0 − 1) .

Thus the time evolution of the perturbed velocity ﬁeld is determined by the
purely imaginary exponent in Eq. (23):

v = v0 + v1 (x, t) = v0

ex + A⊥eikx(x+V t)ey

, n = n0

(24)

where the ”phase speed” is given by

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

V = v0 (s1n0 − 1) .

Taking the real part of the velocity perturbation we obtain as ﬁnal result:

v = v0 [ex + A⊥ cos [kx (x + Vt)] ey] , n = n0.

(25)

The corresponding velocity proﬁle is shown in Fig.2.

Since the velocity perturbation was taken to be normal to the unperturbed
ﬁeld and n1 = 0, both of the constraints of the constancy of the kinetic energy
and the number of particles, Eqs. (17)-(18), are satisﬁed.

As one may see the time dependent part of the velocity perturbation is
a ﬁnite oscillatory function which means that the corresponding stationary
solution is neutrally stable.

As in the previous section the stability analysis of the other possible
hydrodynamic models with s1 = 0 or s1 = s2 gives qualitatively similar
result.

3 Stability of stationary vortical ﬂow with
constant velocity and density in the local
hydrodynamic model

As we have shown in our previous article [13] there are two classes of the
stationary ﬂows in the LHM, linear and radially symmetric or vortical ﬂow.
The stationary vortical solution of the LHM1 (s2 = 0) is given by v0 (r) =

vϕ (r) eϕ, n0 (r) = n0 (r), [12], where

vϕ (r) =

vdl = Cst.

Ir=r0

(27)

We consider small perturbations v1 (r, ϕ, t) of the velocity ﬁeld and n1 (r, ϕ, t)
of the density ﬁeld. The linearized system in the LHM1 is then given by

∂v1
∂t

+ (v1 · ∇) v0 + (v0 · ∇) v1 = s1n0 [(rot v1) × v0 + (rot v0) × v1]

+s1n1 (rot v0) × v0,

(28)

+ ∇ · (n0v1) + ∇ · (n1v0) = 0.

∂ n1
∂t
In this section we consider the stability of a particular class of station-
ary vortical ﬂow for which the density is constant and given by n0 = 1/s1.
Substitution in Eq. (26) results in a constant velocity ﬁeld v0 = vϕeϕ =
(Cst/2πr0) eϕ ≡ Ceϕ. We write the small perturbation in the general form

(29)

v1 = a (r, ϕ, t) er + b (r, ϕ, t) eϕ

and n1 = n0c1 (r, ϕ, t) .

(30)

For the projections of the velocity ﬁeld v = v0 (r) + v1 (r, ϕ, t) together with
the continuity equation for the density ﬁeld n = n0 + n1 (r, ϕ, t) we have

The velocity perturbation must be a periodic functions of the angle ϕ and
can therefore be written as:

b (r, ϕ, t) = vϕB (r) eimϕeβt,

where B (r) is a function of r, m is an integer and β is a constant factor, which
describes the time evolution of the perturbation, Eq. (30). Substituting this
into Eq. (34) one obtains

β = −i m

The solutions (39) and (40) satisfy the linearized system of constraints,

Eqs. (17) and (18), as one can see by angular integration.
Thus, we see that the time evolution of the perturbation Eq. (30) is deter-
mined by the purely imaginary exponent Eq. (38).

The velocity ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 3 for m = 1 and r = 5 m.

Together with the oscillatory contributions we now also have the contri-
bution proportional to t times an oscillating function. This does not neces-
sarily mean that the stationary vortical ﬂow is unstable. The obtained result
indicates that the linear analysis does not give a deﬁnite answer regarding
the stability of the stationary ﬂow. The linear analysis does not give the
deﬁnitive answer regarding the stability of the stationary ﬂow and further
investigation of higher order terms is required. This is beyond the scope of
the present paper.

4 Conclusions

In this paper we considered the stability properties of the planar stationary
ﬂows of the local hydrodynamic model constructed in our ﬁrst paper for
a system of self-propelling particles [12]. These ﬂows are the linear ﬂow
and the radially symmetric ﬂow. Our analysis shows for linear ﬂow, using
linear perturbation theory, that the time evolution of the imposed velocity
and density perturbations are oscillatory. It follows that the linear ﬂows are
neutrally stable. For radially symmetric (vortical) ﬂow linear perturbation
theory does not lead to a conclusive result. A deﬁnitive answer about the
nature of the stability can only be given by considering also higher order
terms in the perturbation expansion. Such an analysis is beyond the scope
of the present paper. Note that such a situation is typical for Hamiltonian
systems which are conservative by deﬁnition and therefore do not display an

11

asymptotic type of stability [14].

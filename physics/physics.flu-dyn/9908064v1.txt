Abstract

A class of A.L.E. time discretisations which inherit key energetic properties (non-
linear dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stability under conditions
of time dependent loading), irrespective of the time increment employed, is estab-
lished in this work. These properties are intrinsic to real ﬂows and the conventional
Navier–Stokes equations.

A description of an incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid, which reconciles the diﬀer-
ences between the various schools of A.L.E. thought in the literature is derived for
the purposes of this investigation. The issue of whether these equations automat-
ically inherit the afore mentioned energetic properties must ﬁrst be resolved.
In
this way natural notions of nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence
of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading are
also formulated.

The ﬁndings of this analysis have profound consequences for the use of certain
classes of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes in the context of deforming references.
It is
signiﬁcant that many algorithms presently in use do not automatically inherit the
fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.

The main conclusions are drawn on in the simulation of a driven cavity ﬂow, a
driven cavity ﬂow with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem, and a
Stokes second order wave. The improved, second order accuracy of a new scheme
for the linearised approximation of the convective term is proved for the purposes of
these simulations. A somewhat novel method to generate ﬁnite element meshes au-
tomatically about included rigid bodies, and which involves ﬁnite element mappings,
is also described.

1 Introduction

S.J. Childs

This work focusses on establishing a class of A.L.E. time discretisations which inherit key
energetic properties (nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence of forcing and
long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading) irrespective of the time
increment employed. The ﬁndings of this analysis have profound consequences for the
use of certain classes of diﬀerence schemes in the context of deforming references.
It
is signiﬁcant that many algorithms presently in use do not automatically inherit the
fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.

Descriptions of ﬂuid motion are conventionally based on the principles of conservation of
mass and linear momentum. One might hope that all such descriptions would accordingly
exhibit the afore mentioned, key energetic properties consistant with the principle of
energy conservation. These properties are intrinsic to real ﬂows and the conventional,
Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations.

A description of an incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid, which reconciles the diﬀerences be-
tween the so–called arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (A.L.E.) formulation of Hughes, Liu
and Zimmerman [6] (deformation gradients absent) and that of Soulaimani, Fortin,
Dhatt and Ouellet [15] (deformation gradients present, but use is problematic), is de-
rived for the purposes of this investigation. The implications of the resulting description
are investigated in the context of energy conservation in a similar, but broader, approach
to that taken by others (eg. Simo and Armero [14]) for the conventional, Eulerian
Navier–Stokes equations.

The main conclusions of this work rely on a new inequality and a number of lemmas, the
proofs of which are listed in an appendix at the end of the paper. The new inequality is
used in place of where the Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality might otherwise have limited the
analysis. The lemmas are mainly concerned with the new convective term. This analysis
is extended in that non–zero boundaries, so–called free boundaries and time–dependent
loads are considered.

The resulting theory is used in the simulation of a driven cavity ﬂow, a driven cavity ﬂow
with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem, and a Stokes second order wave.
A new scheme for the linearised approximation of the convective term is proposed and
the improved, second order accuracy of this scheme is proved for the purposes of these
simulations. A somewhat novel method to generate ﬁnite element meshes automatically
about included rigid bodies, and which involves ﬁnite element mappings, is also described.

2 A Completely General Reference

The implementation of most numerical time integration schemes would be problematic
were a conventional Eulerian1 description of ﬂuid motion to be used in instances involving
deforming domains. The reason is that most numerical time integration schemes require

1Eulerian or spatial descriptions are in terms of ﬁelds deﬁned over the current conﬁguration.

successive function evaluation at ﬁxed spatial locations (the exception being the ﬁnite
element with respect to time approach of Tezduyar, Behr and Liou [18]). On the
other hand meshes rapidly snarl when purely Lagrangian2 descriptions are used. It is for
these reasons that a completely general reference description is usually resorted to.

Eulerian and Lagrangian references are just two, speciﬁc examples of an unlimited number
of conﬁgurations over which to deﬁne ﬁelds used to describe the dynamics of deforming
continua. They are both special cases of a more general reference description, a descrip-
tion in which the referential conﬁguration is deformed at will and which is the focus of
this investigation. A deforming ﬁnite element mesh would be a good example of just such
a deforming reference in practice. The transformation to the completely general reference
involves coordinates where used as spatial variables only and the resultant description is
therefore inertial in the same way as Lagrangian descriptions are.

2.1 Domains, Mappings and a Notation

Consider a material body which occupies a domain Ω at time t. The material domain,
Ω0, is that corresponding to time t = t0 (the reference time, t0, is conventionally, but
not always, zero). A third conﬁguration, ˜Ω, which is chosen arbitrarily is also deﬁned for
the purposes of this work. The three domains are related in the sense that points in one
domain may be obtained as one–to–one invertible maps from points in another.

For any general function f (x, t), a function, ˜f (˜x, t)
f (λ∗(˜x, t), t), can be deﬁned in
terms of the domains and one–to–one, invertible mappings illustrated in Fig. 1. Similarly,
f0(x0, t)
f (λ(x0, t), t) can be deﬁned. This notation can be generalised for the
component–wise deﬁnition of higher order tensors. The key to understanding much of
this work lies possibly in adopting a component-wise deﬁned notation.

Three important results are necessary for the derivation of the completely general refer-
ence description and these are presented below.

This result is demonstrated in Appendix II.

The Energetic Implications . . .

An Element of Area in Terms of a Distorting Reference

The second important result can be recalled from general continuum mechanics. Consider
an element of area, size dA, with an outward unit normal n. Then

ndA = ˜F −t ˜N ˜Jd ˜A

where d ˜A and ˜N denote the respective analogous size and outward unit normal of this el-
ement of area in the referential conﬁguration and ˜J = det ˜F . This result is demonstrated
in most popular textbooks on continuum mechanics (eg. Lai, Rubin and Krempl [10]).

Remark: Notice that ˜N is the single exception to the ˜ quantities devised in this work.
˜N is the surface normal perceived in a completely general reference and the components
of n and ˜N need have nothing in common ( ˜N is not ˜n).

2.3 Derivation of the Completely General Equation

One way in which to derive a completely general reference description of an incompress-
ible, Newtonian ﬂuid is to start with the balance laws in global (integral) form, and
to make the necessary substitutions in these integrals. The desired numerical imple-
mentation (similar to the conventional Navier–Stokes one which has been thoroughly
investigated and found to be stable) is then obtained.

Conservation of Mass

Let Ω(t) be an arbitrary sub–volume of material. The principle of conservation of mass
states that

is obtained, where ˜q and ˜w are respectively the arbitrary pressure and velocity of the
variational formulation.

Notice that the usual procedure of assigning a value of zero to the arbitrary velocity,
˜w, at the boundary has not been followed. The boundary integral in the variational
momentum equation has consequently not been eliminated as is normally done. The
reasons are twofold; ﬁrstly problems for which the ensuing investigation is intended are
of a free boundary type and so the solution is not known there; secondly, a speciﬁc
function (which cannot arbitrarily be assigned a value of zero at the boundary) will be
substituted for ˜w in the forthcoming analysis.

2.4 Reconciling the Diﬀerent Schools of Thought

The equations (6) and (7) are the completely general referential description of an incom-
pressible, Newtonian ﬂuid. They reduce to the so–called A.L.E. equations of Hughes,
Liu and Zimmerman [6] for an instant in which spatial and referential conﬁgurations
coincide.

Since the approximate set of equations is broken into a sequence of discrete time steps in
the implementation, one is entitled to choose a new referential conﬁguration during each
time step, should one so desire. This is what is known as an “updated” approach; when
each time step is really a fresh implementation. In the case of time stepping schemes
based about a single instant (eg. the generalised class of Euler diﬀerence schemes to
be investigated in Section 4) a considerably simpliﬁed implementation can be achieved
by an appropriate choice of conﬁgurations. Making the choice of a referential conﬁgura-
tion which coincides with the spatial conﬁguration at the instant about which the time
stepping scheme is based allows the deformation gradient to be omitted from the approx-
imation altogether (the deformation gradient is identity under such circumstances). For
such implementations (those which require evaluation about a single point only) no error
arises from the use of the equations cited in Hughes, Liu and Zimmerman [6],

These equations are not valid for any, arbitrary choice of reference or if the implemen-
tation requires the equation to be evaluated at more than one point within each time
step (eg. a Runge–Kutta or ﬁnite–element–in–time scheme). It is important to remember
that in a discrete context the reference conﬁguration is ﬁxed for the duration of the entire
time increment. Although the referential conﬁguration is hypothetical and can be chosen
arbitrarily for each time step, once chosen it is static for the duration of the entire time
step. Once the coincidence of conﬁgurations is ordained at a given instant, ˜F is deﬁned
by the reference (mesh) deformation, both before and after, and must be consistant.

The equations of Hughes et al. are an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (A.L.E.) de-
scription in the very true sense under the circumstances of implementations requiring

evaluation about more than one point within each time step (this is not surprising con-
sidering the equations have their origins in the arbitrarily, either Lagrangian or Eulerian
programmes of Hirt, Amsden and Cook [5]). This fact is further bourne out in observ-
ing that key energetic properties, consistant with the principle of energy conservation,
are not automatically inherited by the equations of Hughes et. al. in the context of
more general references.

The momentum equations of Soulaimani, Fortin, Dhatt and Ouellet [15] are
ﬂawed as a result of the mistaken belief that ˜σ ˜F −1 ˜J is the Piola–Kirchoﬀ stress tensor
of the ﬁrst kind (pg. 268 of Soulaimani et al.). Yet another problem is illustrated
by rewriting the conventional incompressibility condition using the chain rule. The new
incompressibility condition which arises is most certainly

these equations problematic.

There would seem to be no reason why one would wish to deﬁne the deformation about
a conﬁguration other than that at the instant about which the implementation is based
(assuming the implementation used is indeed based about a single point eg. a ﬁnite
diﬀerence) thereby involving deformation gradients. Resolving the resulting diﬃculties
associated with the deformation gradients by means of a perturbation seems unnecessarily
complicated in the light of the above reasoning.

3 Natural Notions of Energy Conservation in Terms

of the Completely General Equations

The eﬀect of quantities parameterising reference deformation on key energetic properties
– nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stabil-
ity under conditions of time dependent loading – is investigated in this section. These
properties, of form

One might anticipate key energetic properties to be manifest only in instances involving a
ﬁxed contributing mass of material, whether its boundaries be dynamic, or not. An anal-
ysis of this nature only makes sense in the context of a constant volume of incompressible
ﬂuid.

Inequalities of the Poincar´e-Friedrichs type are a key feature of any stability analysis of
this nature. Gradient containing L2 terms need to be re–expressed in terms of energy.
In the case of a “no slip” (v = 0) condition on the entire boundary the situation is
straightforward, in that it is possible to use the standard Poincare-Friedrichs inequality:
there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that

The use of the classical Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality is otherwise identiﬁed as a ma-
jor limitation, even in the conventional Navier–Stokes related analyses. The Poincar´e–
Friedrichs inequality is only applicable in very limited instances where the value for the
entire boundary is stipulated to be identically zero. For boundary conditions of a more
general nature, such as those encountered in this study, in which parts of the boundary
may be either a free surface, have an imposed velocity or be subject to traction conditions,
a more suitable inequality is required. (It should, however, be noted that subtracting
a boundary velocity and analysing the resulting equation is nonetheless still a feasable
alternative, despite the fact that the equations are nonlinear. This approach requires a
more sophisticated and involved level of mathematics1.)

Some common boundary types and associated descriptions are brieﬂy summarised as
follows:

1. Fixed impermeable boundaries: The description at such boundaries is usually
Eulerian and the quantities ˜F and ˜vref consequently become identity and zero
respectively. These are typically (but not always) “no slip” boundaries, implying
that ˜v

|Γ= 0.

2. Free boundaries: Conventional use allows the spatial mesh to slide along free
boundaries while still maintaining their overall Lagrangian character. Stated more
formally,

The total volume is nonetheless still a material volume overall.

3. Imposed velocity-type boundaries: Conventional use entails descriptions which
usually become pure Eulerian at such boundaries. The total ﬂow across such bound-
aries is zero for an incompressible ﬂuid if volume is to be preserved. For boundary–
driven ﬂows one therefore usually assumes that the quantity

These are the modes of reference deformation commonly used at boundaries encountered
in practice and which will need to be accommodated if the theory is to be applicable.

The particular types of geometry considered are those that arise in problems involving
the motion of rigid bodies such as pebbles on the sea bed; thus a free surface is present,
and the domain may be multiply connected. The Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality does,
furthermore, not hold on subdomains of the domain in question and the constant is not
optimal.

Further investigation (communication [13]) reveals a similar relation, the so-called
Poincar´e–Morrey inequality, holds providing the function attains a value of zero some-
where on the boundary. The proof of the Poincar´e-Morrey inequality is, however, similar
to that of one of Korn’s inequalities (see, for example, Kikuchi and Oden [7]).
In
particluar, it is non–constructive, by contradiction and the constant cannot therefore be
determined as part of the proof. Viewed in this light the forthcoming inequality amounts
to a speciﬁcation of the hypothetical constant in the Poincar´e–Morrey inequality for
domains having a star–shaped geometry.

Inequality 1 (A New “Poincar´e” Inequality) Suppose v is continuous and dif-
ferentiable to ﬁrst order and that v attains a maximum absolute value, c, on an included,
ﬁnite neighbourhood of minimum radius Rmin about a point xorigin (as depicted in Fig.

This inequality is similar to the Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality when c = 0, but is ex-
tended to a geometrical subclass of domains which have free and partly non-zero bound-
aries.
It has a further advantage in that the constant is an order of magnitude more
optimal when used under the “no slip” Poincar´e–Friedrichs condition (under such con-
ditions the domain can always be deconstructed into a number of subdomains in which
Rmin = 1
3Rmax). The Poincar´e–Friedrichs inequality is a special case of the above inequal-
ity. The necessary lemma (below) follows naturally from Inequality 1.

3.1 Exponential Dissipation in the Absence of Forcing

The issue of whether nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence of forcing is
a property intrinsic to the deforming reference description is resolved by the following
theorem.

Theorem 1 (Exponential Dissipation in the Absence of Forcing) A suﬃcient
condition for the completely general reference description to inherit nonlinear, exponential
type energy dissipation

˜K(˜v)
in the absence of forcing is that the reference moves in a vanishing ˜n
fashion
at free boundaries and becomes pure Eulerian at boundaries of a ﬁxed, impermeable type
(the conventional use).

A nonlinear, exponential–type energy dissipation in the absence of forcing is therefore an

property is also an intrinsic property of the conventional Navier–Stokes equations.

3.2 Long–Term Stability under Conditions of Time–Dependent

Loading

The formulation of suitable load and free surface bounds is necessary before the issue
of long-term stability (L2–stability) under conditions of time–dependent loading can be
resolved. The energy transfer across boundaries at which there is an imposed velocity
is a further factor which must be taken into account under conditions of forcing. The
following lemma facilitates the formulation of load and free surface bounds.

The preceding analyses lead to natural notions of nonlinear dissipation in the absence
of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time–dependent loading for the
analytic problem. These properties are also intrinsic features of real ﬂows and the Navier–
Stokes equations.

†The additional terms ˜K˜Γimposed ˜v are given in Appendix I. They are only applicable in instances
where there is an imposed velocity at the boundary. The other two boundary terms are only applicable
at boundaries which involve tractions.

4 The Energetic Implications of the Time Discreti-

sation

This section is concerned with establishing a class of time discretisations which inherit
the self–same energetic properties (nonlinear dissipation in the absence of forcing and
long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading) as the analytic problem,
irrespective of the time increment employed. In this section a generalised, Euler diﬀerence
time–stepping scheme for the completely general reference equation is formulated and
the energetic implications are investigated in a similar manner to that carried out for the
analytic equations in the previous section.

This stability analysis is inspired by the approach of others to schemes for the conventional
Navier–Stokes equations. The desirability of the attributes identiﬁed as key energetic
properties is recognised and they have been used as a benchmark in the analysis of
various of the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes schemes by a host of authors. Related
work on the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations can be found in a variety of
references, for example Temam [17] and Simo and Armero [14].

The analyses presented here are extended, not only in the sense that they deal with
the completely general reference equation, but also in that non–zero boundaries, so–
called free boundaries and time–dependent loads are able to be taken into account (the
former two as a consequence of the new inequality). The ﬁndings of this work have
profound consequences for the implementation of the deforming reference equations. It
is signiﬁcant that many algorithms used for long–term simulation do not automatically
inherit the fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.

A Generalised Time–Stepping Scheme

by introducing an “intermediate” velocity

It will presently become apparent that relevant energy terms are not readily recovered
from the time-discrete equations for deforming references in general. It may therefore
make sense to perform the analyses for the time–discrete equation in the context of diver-
gence free rates of reference deformation only. A practically less restrictive alternative is
too labour intensive. This investigation is accordingly restricted to a subclass of reference
deformations in which “reference volume” is conserved. This is for reasons of expedience
alone and it is hoped that this subclass of deformations is thought to be representative.

Assumption 1 The assumptions ˜Jn = ˜Jn+α and ˜Jn+1 = ˜Jn+α are made so that the

Remark: Recall that in the investigation of the analytic problem, a term arising from the
manipulation of the acceleration containing term (the term containing the rate of change
of the Jacobian) cancelled with the convective energy. It is therefore not surprising that
assumptions pertaining to the acceleration containing term (in particular to the rate of
change of the Jacobian) in the discrete problem will, once made, also be necessary for
the corresponding discrete convective energy term to vanish (reﬀering to the div vref = 0
condition of Lemma 6). This is a good prognosis for the energetic behaviour of the
discrete problem in circumstances of reference deformations excluded by Assumption 1.
The full ramiﬁcations of Assumption 1 are considered in Subsection 8.2 of Appendix I.
This concludes the preliminaries required for the analysis of the time–discrete equation.

4.1 Nonlinear Dissipation in the Absence of Forcing

This second part of the time–discrete analysis establishes a class of time stepping schemes
which exhibit long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading, irrespective
of the time increment employed. The following lemma is necessary to the analysis and
is concerned with devising a bound for the energy at an intermediate point in terms of
energy values at either end of the time step.

5 Some Numerical Examples

Some numerical results for problems of the type in question are presently given. The
theory thus far developed was employed in the simulation of a driven cavity ﬂow, a
driven cavity ﬂow with various, included rigid bodies, a die–swell problem and a Stokes,
second order wave.

The approach taken when approximating free surfaces, was that they may be treated
as a material entity, that is, the material derivative of the free surface was assumed
zero. Euler’s equations and conservation of linear momentum were used to determine the
motion of the rigid body. A predictor–corrector method was used to solve the combined
sub–problems.

A backward diﬀerence scheme was used to approximate the time derivative in the ﬂuid
sub–problem (in compliance with the Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 conditions), the ﬁnite
element method was used for the spatial (referential “space”) discretisation and a Q2–P1
element pair was used as a basis. A penalty method was employed to eliminate pressure
as a variable and nonlinearity was circumvented by way of a new, second order accurate
linearisation. Linearising with a guess obtained by extrapolating through solutions from
the previous two time steps leads to second order accuracy.

The problem is essentially that of a square, two–dimensional pot whose lid is moved
across the top at a rate equal to its diameter for a Reynolds number of unity. The
boundary conditions are accordingly “no slip” on container walls and a horizontal ﬂow
of unity across the top (depicted in Fig. 3).

5.2 Example 2: “Pebble in a Pothole”

In this example rigid bodies of varying mass and moments of inertia were released from
rest in a ﬂow dictated by the same boundary conditions as the driven cavity ﬂow of the
previous example. One would expect a die bead (a small rigid body of neutral bouyancy)
to move in tandem with the ﬂuid soon after its release from rest. One might also expect
a clockwise rotation to be induced by concentrating the mass closer to the centre i.e.
lowering the moment of inertia.

The ﬁnite element mesh was automatically generated and adjusted about the included
rigid body in what is possibly a slightly novel fashion. A small region of mesh immediately
adjacent to the included rigid body was repeatedly remapped to cope with the changing
orientation, the remainder was squashed/stretched according to the translation.

To begin with, a square region of mesh centered on, and including the rigid body, is
deleted (depicted in Fig. 6). Each of four wedge–shaped regions is then demarcated (the
intersections of lines which bisect corners and edges of the square frame, with the surface
of the rigid body are located using Newton’s method) by as many points as there are
nodes in an element i.e. each wedge shaped–region is set up as a massive element.

Figure 6: The Local Distortion is Obtained by Mapping Square Chunks of Rectangular
Mesh Using Finite Element Mappings.

Chunks of uniform mesh, which have identical extremities to those of the master element,
are then mapped into the newly–demarcated, wedge–shaped regions using ﬁnite element
mappings (in exactly the same manner as points in the master element domain are,

26

S.J. Childs

in theory, mapped into individual mesh elements). Further, ﬁne adjustment of nodes
intended to delineate the surface of the rigid body is accomplished by moving them
along a line between node and centre, to the rigid body surface using Newton’s method.
The mesh outside the “box” (the box containing the 4 wedges enclosing the rigid body)
is squashed/stretched according to the requirements of the translation (the nodes are
translated by a factor inversely proportional to their distance from the box). This method
satisﬁes the requirement that ˜n
vanishes at the ﬂuid–rigid body interface (a
condition in Theorems 1, 2, 3 and 4). Mesh reﬁnement in the vicinity of the included,
(cid:17)
rigid body is an automatic by-product of this method.

umented in the literature (Kruyt, Cuvelier, Segal and Van Der Zanden [9],
Omodei [12] and Engelman and Dupret quoted in Kruyt et al.). The basic theme
to this problem is the extrusion of a ﬂuid with initial parabolic ﬂow proﬁle from the end
of a short nozzle.

Problems with wave propagation were subsequently experienced as time progressed. It
should be noted, however, that the problem was not attempted with the same seriousness
as previous examples and the mesh was poor (there being only three elements in the
vertical extent of the mesh).

6 Conclusions

The correct equations, which describe the motion of an incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuid
and which are valid for a completely general range of reference deformations, are equations
(6) and (7). For implementations requiring the equations to be evaluated about a single
instant within each time step only (eg. ﬁnite diﬀerences), the deformation gradients may
be assumed identity i.e. the equations of Hughes, Liu and Zimmerman [6] (equations
(10) and (11)) will suﬃce.

In this work it is shown (as was hoped) that nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the
absence of forcing and long–term stability under conditions of time dependent loading
are properties automatically inherited by deforming reference descriptions. The single
provisor is that the conventional boundary descriptions are used (vanishing ˜n
˜vref
type at free boundaries, purely Eulerian at boundaries across which there is an imposed
(cid:17)
velocity or where boundaries are of a ﬁxed, impermeable type). These properties are
intrinsic to real ﬂows and the conventional, Eulerian Navier–Stokes equations.

−

˜v

(cid:16)

·

Relevant energy terms are, however, not readily recovered from the time–discrete equa-
tions for deforming references in general. Only for divergence free rates of reference
deformation could it consequently be guaranteed that energy would not be artiﬁcially
introduced to the algorithmic ﬂow by way of the reference. A further casualty of the dis-
crete analysis is its failure to account for ﬂows driven by their boundaries in any obvious
way i.e. boundaries of an imposed velocity type do not enter explicitly into the bound.
Scope for the further development of this work therefore exists.

The divergence free assumption was made for reasons of expedience alone and it is hoped
that the ﬁndings of the time–discrete analysis can be extrapolated to a more general
class of mesh deformations. If one were to be overly cautious on this basis one would be
faced with the additional challenge of enforcing mesh deformations which are divergence
free. Such a totally divergence free description may, however, not be practical. Both the
purely Lagrangian and purely Eulerian ﬂuid descriptions have divergence free rates of
distortion.

What is clear is that there are inherent problems with using certain classes of time–
stepping schemes and the use of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes more implicit than central
diﬀerence is consequently advocated. The limitations of the time–discrete analysis do not
detract from this ﬁnding in any way. Such diﬀerences exhibit the key energetic properties
(nonlinear, exponential–type dissipation in the absence of forcing and long–term stability
under conditions of time dependent loading) irrespective of the time increment employed.
A backward diﬀerence is the obvious choice. Calculations at time t+α∆t would require an
intermediate mesh and associated quantities for instances in which α

The Energetic Implications . . .

The author recommends a strategy in which a predominantly Eulerian description is
used, where possible, for the bulk of the problem (from an eﬃciency point of view) and
the completely general reference description for the remainder is appropriate. Purely
Eulerian descriptions have the advantage of a “one oﬀ” ﬁnite element construction and
involve none of the hazards of a badly distorted reference.

With regard to numerical implementation and using a Q2–P1 element pair, it was found
that pressures approximated as linear on the master element still led to so–called “lock-
ing” or “chequerboard” modes. The pressures needed to be linear on the actual elements
themselves. This ﬁnding makes sense if one considers that a linear function mapped from
the master element using a Q2 mapping will no longer be P1 for non–rectangular ele-
ments (the Q2–P1 element pair was shown to satisfy the L.B.B. condition in the context
of rectangular elements).

Lastly, the linearised terms (2v
t−∆t) are
second order accurate approximations of the convective term and a remarkably practical,
simple and eﬀective method to automatically generate meshes about included rigid bodies
was devised.

Temam [17] for ﬂows driven by their boundaries, however, the intended purpose diﬀers
slightly. What is here being sought is a bound formulated in terms of known, physically
comprehensible quantities at the boundary which are independant of the solution.

Abstract

The streamwise and transverse velocities are measured simultaneously in grid turbu-

lence at Reynolds numbers 100–300. We extract typical intermittency patterns, which are

consistent with velocity proﬁles of Burgers and Lamb–Oseen vortices. The radii of these

vortex tubes are estimated to be several of the Kolmogorov length.

1 Introduction

By using direct numerical simulations [1] and bubble-visualization experiments [2], it has been estab-

lished that turbulence contains vortex tubes. Regions of intense vorticity are organized into tubes.

Their radii and lengths are, respectively, of the orders of the Kolmogorov length η and the integral

length L. Their lifetimes are several turnover times of the largest eddies. Vortex tubes occupy a small

fraction of the volume, and are embedded in a background ﬂow which is random and of large scales

(see also reviews [3, 4, 5]).

The most familiar model for the tubes is the Burgers vortex [6]. This is an axisymmetric ﬂow in

a strain ﬁeld. In cylindrical coordinates, they are written as

and

uθ ∝

2ν

ar  1 − exp −

ar2

4ν !! (a > 0),

(ur, uθ, uz) = (cid:18)−

2

ar, 0, az(cid:19) .

(2)

Here ν is the kinetic viscosity. The above equation (1) describes a rigid-body rotation for small radii,

and a circulation decaying in radius for large radii. The velocity is maximal at r = r0 = 2.24(ν/a)

1

2 .

Thus r0 is regarded as the tube radius. The same circulation pattern is expected for the Lamb–Oseen

vortex, i.e., an unstretched diﬀusing tube [7].

The eﬀect of vortex tubes on the velocity ﬁeld is of great interest. This is especially the case at

high Reynolds numbers, Reλ ≫ 100. They are achieved only in experiments, where a measurement

is made with a probe suspended in the ﬂow, and merely a one-dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld

is obtained. The velocity signal at small scales is enhanced in a fraction of the volume [8]. This

small-scale intermittency is attributable to vortex tubes. However, measurements often deal with

the velocity component in the mean-ﬂow direction alone (hereafter, the streamwise velocity u). The

transverse velocity v is more suited to detecting rotational ﬂows such as those associated with vortex

tubes [9, 10, 11].

This Letter reports simultaneous measurements of the streamwise and transverse velocities in

high-Reynolds-number ﬂows behind a grid. Grid turbulence is almost isotropic and free from external

inﬂuences such as mean shear, and is hence suited to studying universal properties of turbulence [8, 12].

With a conditional averaging technique, we extract typical intermittency patterns, which turn out to

agree with velocity proﬁles of Burgers and Lamb–Oseen vortices. Then energetic importance of the

vortex tubes is studied as a function of the scale.

2 Experiments

The experiments were done in two wind tunnels of Meteorological Research Institute. Their test

sections are of 3 × 2 × 18 and 0.8 × 0.8 × 3 m in size. Turbulence was produced by placing a grid

across the entrance to the test section. The grid consists of two layers of uniformly spaced rods, the

axes of which are perpendicular to each other. We used three grids. The separation of the axes of

their adjacent rods are M = 10, 20, and 40 cm. The cross sections of the rods are, respectively, 2

× 2, 4 × 4, and 6 × 6 cm. The mean wind was set to be U ≃ 4, 8, or 12 m s−1. We consequently

conducted 8 sets of experiments as summarized in Table 1.

The streamwise (U + u) and transverse (v) velocities were measured simultaneously with a hot-

wire anemometer. The anemometer is composed of a crossed-wire probe and a constant temperature

system. The probe was positioned on the tunnel axis at d = 2, 3, or 6 m downstream of the grid. The

hot wires are 5 µm in diameter, 1.25 mm in eﬀective length, 1.25 mm in separation, and oriented at

±45◦ to the mean-ﬂow direction. Pitch-angle calibration was done before each of the measurements.

The signal was low-pass ﬁltered at fc = 4–12 kHz with 24 dB/octave, and sampled digitally at fs =

8–24 kHz with 16-bit resolution. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency was set to be twice of the

ﬁlter cutoﬀ frequency. The entire length of the signal was as long as 2 × 107 points, since we have to

minimize statistical uncertainties.

The turbulence level, i.e., the ratio of the root-mean-square value of the streamwise ﬂuctuation

hu2i

1

2 to the mean streamwise velocity U , was always less than 10% (Table 1). This good characteristic

of grid turbulence allows us to rely on the frozen-eddy hypothesis of Taylor, ∂/∂t = −U ∂/∂x, which

converts temporal variations into spatial variations in the mean-wind direction [13].

To obtain the maximum spatial resolution, we set fc in such a way that U/fc is comparable to the

probe size, ∼ 1 mm. Since the probe is larger than the Kolmogorov length (see below), the smallest-

scale motions of the ﬂow were ﬁltered out. The present spatial resolution is nevertheless typical of

hot-wire anemometry [10, 14]. Though the RELIEF technique achieves a greater resolution [9], it is

applicable only to the transverse velocity.

The ﬂow parameters such as the integral length L, the Kolmogorov length η, the Taylor microscale

λ, and the Reynolds number Reλ are given in Table 1. The Reλ values range from 100 to 300. They

exceed those in almost all the past studies of grid turbulence [4, 8, 12]. This is because our wind

tunnels as well as our grids are large. The present data provide for the ﬁrst time an opportunity to

study vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence at high Reynolds numbers.

3 Conditional average

To examine the presence or absence of vortex tubes, we extract typical intermittency patterns in

the streamwise (u) and transverse velocities (v). The patterns are obtained by averaging the signals

centered at the position where the transverse-velocity increment δv(s) = v(x + s) − v(x) is enhanced

over its root-mean-square value by more than a factor of 3, i.e., |δv(s)| > 3hδv(s)2i

1

2 . Here the scale

s is set to be the spatial resolution U/fc. Such an event is detected 2–5 times per the integral length.

When the increment is negative, we inverse the sign of the v signal. The results for experiments 1,

3, 7, and 8 are shown in Fig. 1 (solid lines). We applied the conditional averaging also for the other

experiments and with other threshold values. Their results are consistent with those in Fig. 1.

For reference, we show velocity proﬁles of Burgers vortices (dotted lines). The transverse compo-

nent is from the circulation ﬂow (1), while the streamwise component is from the radial inﬂow − 1

2 ar

of the strain ﬁeld (2). Here it is assumed that the tube center passes through the probe position and

the tube axis is perpendicular to the streamwise and transverse directions. The tube radius r0 was

determined so as to reproduce the v pattern for each of the experiments.

Grid turbulence exhibits nearly the same v pattern as that of a Burgers vortex. Tubes are surely

ubiquitous at Reλ ≃ 100–300. Their radii are estimated to be several of the Kolmogorov length (r0 ≃

6–8η). Since these estimates are well above the s values, they should represent typical radii of vortex

tubes. Similar tube radii have been obtained from direct numerical simulations [1].

The u pattern of grid turbulence exhibits a trace of the strain ﬁeld. Thus at least some of the

vortex tubes are of Burgers type. However, the observed strain is less signiﬁcant than those of Burgers

vortices. There could exist unstretched tubes such as Lamb–Oseen vortices. In numerical turbulence

[1], vortex tubes are not always oriented to the stretching direction. Once a tube is stretched to a

high amplitude, it decouples from the original strain ﬁeld. This could be the case in grid turbulence

[12].

We applied the conditional averaging to larger values of s (not shown here). The velocity patterns

for s < L have nearly the same shapes as in Fig. 1. However, with increasing the scale s, the

corresponding tube radius r0 becomes large, while the amplitude of the u pattern becomes small as

compared with that of the v pattern. Velocity signals at large scales reﬂect tubes which are inclined to

the mean-wind direction. The inclination does not change the shape of the velocity pattern, but the

tube radius along the mean-wind direction rmw is greater than its true radius [11, 15]. In addition,

there could exist large-radius unstretched tubes which are not coupled with the strain ﬁeld.

Velocity patterns are extracted also for enhancements of the streamwise-velocity increment δu(s)

4

= u(x + s) − u(x). The results for δu(s) > +3hδu(s)2i

1

2 are shown in Fig. 2, while those for δu(s) <

−3hδu(s)2i

1

2 are shown in Fig. 3. The v pattern, which was obtained by conditioning over the sign of

the local slope, is close to a velocity proﬁle of a Burgers or Lamb–Oseen vortex. Thus an enhancement

of δu(s) is caused by a vortex tube. The u pattern is explained by the circulation ﬂow (1) crossing

the probe at some distance [15], together with the strain ﬁeld (2). The event δu(s) < −3hδu(s)2i

1

2 is

detected two times more frequently than the event δu(s) > +3hδu(s)2i

1

2 . This fact is consistent with

the u pattern in Fig. 1, which exhibits a negative slope at the tube position.

We comment on controversial results in Figs. 1–3. First, the v pattern is somewhat extended as

compared with the velocity proﬁle of a Burgers vortex, especially in experiments 7 and 8, where the

Reynolds number is high. Vortex tubes in grid turbulence might not be exactly the same as Burgers

or Lamb–Oseen vortices. There might exist additional contributions from inclined tubes. Second, the

u pattern is embedded in a one-sided excursion, u ≃ a few tenths of hu2i

1

2 > 0, which extends to x ≃

±L. This might be due to an artifact of the frozen-eddy hypothesis. The streamwise velocity has a

ﬂuctuation of the order of hu2i

1

2 over the scale L. Thus the speed at which a vortex tube crosses the

probe is higher or lower than the mean wind speed. The observed radius of the tube is accordingly

smaller or larger than its rmw value. Since the scale s is at around the typical radius of vortex tubes,

inclined tubes with rmw > s are more numerous than tubes with rmw < s. Fast-moving tubes with

rmw > s could be captured in our averaging process for the scale s and cause the observed u excursion.

We admit that these interpretations are tentative. It is important to conduct detailed analyses of data

obtained under wider ranges of conditions.

4 Flatness factor

To study energetic importance of vortex tubes as a function of the scale, we compute the ﬂatness

factor of the transverse-velocity increment δv(s) = v(x + s) − v(x):

ﬂatness factor =

hδv(s)4i
hδv(s)2i2 .

(3)

The ﬂatness factor serves as a measure of the relative importance between vortex tubes and the

background ﬂow at each of the scales. If the velocity increments follow a Gaussian distribution, the

ﬂatness factor is equal to 3. If the tail of the probability distribution of the velocity increments is

more pronounced than that of a Gaussian, the ﬂatness factor is higher than 3. The velocity-increment

distribution observed at s ≥ L, where the background ﬂow is predominant, is close to a Gaussian

[3, 5, 9]. On the other hand, the v pattern for an enhancement of δv(s) at s < L is close to a velocity

5

proﬁle of a Burgers or Lamb–Oseen vortex, i.e., a model for the vortex tubes (§3).

Fig. 4 shows the ﬂatness factor for the transverse velocity v in experiments 1, 3, 7, and 8. The

abscissa is the scale s normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. We indicate the integral length L and

the Taylor microscale λ (arrows). At large scales, the ﬂatness factor is equal to the Gaussian value of

3. This is because the velocity increments reﬂect the background ﬂow. As the scale is decreased from

the integral length, the ﬂatness factor begins to increase. This is due to a progressive contribution of

vortex tubes. The tubes aﬀect velocity increments at scales around their observed sizes, which could

be as large as their lengths (≃ L). Around the Taylor microscale, the increase becomes signiﬁcant.

Fig. 4 also shows the ﬂatness factor for the streamwise velocity u, which is less enhanced than

that for the transverse velocity v. This ﬁnding is consistent with past experimental and numerical

studies [1, 14]. From our results in Figs. 2 and 3, the streamwise ﬂatness factor is expected to reﬂect

the energetic importance of vortex tubes, as in the case of the transverse ﬂatness factor. However, the

u pattern for a vortex tube is less pronounced than the v pattern. The circulation ﬂow of a vortex

tube contributes to the streamwise velocity only if its axis passes at some distance from the probe.

Moreover, the streamwise-velocity increment suﬀers from the strain ﬁeld.

The ﬂatness factors in Fig. 4 are displayed in order of increasing the Reynolds number (from top

to bottom). There appears to exist a trend of increasing the small-scale ﬂatness. This appearance is

conﬁrmed in Fig. 5, which shows the ﬂatness factors at the ﬁxed scales s = 10η (a) and λ (b). Those

for the streamwise and transverse velocities increase in a similar manner with the Reλ value. In both

the velocity components, vortex tubes are increasingly predominant over the background ﬂow at a

higher Reynolds number. The increase of the ﬂatness factors is more signiﬁcant at the smaller scale s

= 10η, where the background ﬂow is less important. We also studied the ﬂatness factors at s ≃ L/2

(not shown here), which appear to depend on the grid size M rather than the Reλ value.

5 Conclusion

To summarize, vortex tubes are important to the intermittency pattern of the transverse velocity at

Reλ ≃ 100–300. The pattern is well approximated as a velocity proﬁle of a Burgers or Lamb–Oseen

vortex, if its radius is several of the Kolmogorov length (Fig. 1). The strain ﬁeld associated with the

tube is present in the streamwise velocity. With increasing the Reynolds number, vortex tubes become

more predominant over the background ﬂow (Figs. 4 and 5). We believe that these ﬁndings are new

and convincing, owing to long records of both the streamwise and transverse velocities in isotropic

turbulence at high Reynolds numbers. Similar experiments of grid turbulence at much higher Reynolds

6

numbers, Reλ ≫ 300, would be crucial to proceed further [4, 5].

Velocity derivatives were obtained as ∂u/∂x = (8u(x + ∆) − 8u(x − ∆) − u(x + 2∆) + u(x − 2∆))/12∆,

where ∆ is the sampling interval U/fs. The experiments 1 and 2 were made in the 0.8 × 0.8 ×

3 m tunnel, while the other experiments were made in the 3 × 2 × 18 m tunnel. To check the

isotropy, the transverse velocity was also used to compute the L, λ, and η values, via the relations

L = 2R hv(x + s)v(x)i/hv2ids and h(∂u/∂x)2i = h(∂v/∂x)2i/2. The L value derived from the v data

is smaller by a factor of 0.5–0.6 than that derived from the u data. Thus our grid turbulence is

anisotropic at largest scales. On the other hand, the λ and η values derived from the v data agree

with those derived from the u data within ≤ 1%. The exceptions are the results for experiments 1

and 2, where the discrepancy is 10–20%. This anisotropic character is consistent with the fact that

their measured ratios of hu2i

Conformal mapping of a slab of a two-dimensional ultrasonic crystal generate a closed geometrical
arrangement of ultrasonic scatterers with appealing acoustic properties. This acoustic shell is able
to conﬁne ultrasonic modes. Some of these internal resonances can be induced from an external wave
source. The mapping of a linear defect produces a wave-guide that exhibits a spatial-frequency se-
lection analogous to that characteristic of a synthetic “cochlea” . Both, experimental and theoretical
results are reported here.

It has been recently reported that a parallel-sided slab
of material with negative refractive index can work as a
perfect lens [1] and conformal transformations applied to
these slabs generate a variety of lenses [2]. Also, quite
recently, curvilinear coordinate transformations and con-
formal mappings have been applied to versatile optic
metamaterials in order to develop cloaks of invisibility
[3]. On the other hand, phononic crystals, i.e., periodic
composite materials whose structure varies on the scale
of the wavelength of the sound and exhibiting forbidden
frequency band-gaps, have also stirred a great interest
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Here, we apply a conformal transfor-
mation to a slab of a conventional two-dimensional ultra-
sonic crystal to build a continuous ﬁeld of ultrasonic scat-
terers that displays conspicuous physical results. Several
acoustic properties of this transformed struture are stud-
ied theoretically and experimentally.

The analytic function using in this letter to generate
the conformal mapping is w = exp(z), where w = u + iv,
and z = x + iy; z belonging to the original complex plane
and w to the transformed one [11]. This exponential
function transforms parallel lines of the original slab into
concentric circumferences. Since this continuous trans-
formation preserves the angles between grid lines but
not the size of the objects, the transmission spectra is
disturbed in a complex way, displaying a lot of localized
resonant modes. The similarity ratio in the transformed
arrangement is locally equal to |dw/dz|, preserving the
ﬁlling ratio of the transformed unit cell and, hence, the ef-
fective medium parameters for the long wavelength limit
[12] are also conserved. This property is characteristic of
conformal structures but is not fulﬁlled in the recently
reported circular photonic crystals [13].

By applying the exponential conformal mapping to an
adequate square periodic slab of identical circles, we gen-
erate the radial structure shown in Fig.1(a). Aluminum

and the diameter of its corresponding cylinders is 7.5 mm.
The radius of the outer circumference is 113.9 mm and the
diameter of its cylinders is 37.9 mm.

cylinders were glued to a methacrylate layer with 6 mm of
thickness. Cylinders, with a height of 5 cm, were turned
from bars of aluminum UNE 6082 (L 3453). The Young
modulus of this material is E = 6.9x1010 N/m2 and its
density is ρ = 2.7x103 Kg/m3. These cylindrical scatter-
ers were immersed in a large vessel, provided with ane-
choic walls, and ﬁlled with degasiﬁed water with a depth
of 6 cm.

To measure the acoustic transmission through this
shell of immersed cylindrical scatterers we emit with a
Langevin type piezoelectric sandwich, built by using two
PZT-5A piezoelectric rings. Te diameter of the is of
D=15.5 mm and the length, without coating, of L = 33
mm. The launched signal is always received in a PVDF
needle hydrophone DAPCO NP 10-3A90 and processed
by means of a Hewlett Packard 4194A Impedance/Gain-
Phase Analyzer. Theoretical calculations are carried out
by solving the acoustic propagation equation by means
of the Finite Element Method (FEM). We only present
experimental measurements within the two broad reso-
nance bands of the piezoelectric sandwich, ranging from
50 to 100 kHz and from 120 to 160 kHz respectively.

In Fig.1(b) we show both theoretical and experimen-
tal measurements of the outgoing transmission spectrum
through the conformally mapped structure. The trans-
mitter is now the transducer diametrically placed near
the inner circular layer of scatterers and the receiver is
the needle hydrophone located just at the output of the
structure at the end of the corresponding emission radius.
This measurement scheme is always chosen in order to
proﬁt the high directionality of the sandwich transducer,
thus overcoming the high energy damping of the system.

both the original square and its corresponding confor-

the conformal structures the exciting waves are concen-
tric circular waves launched from the inner of the cavities
and their corresponding transmission spectra are calcu-
lated by integrating the received signal along a concentric
circle enclosing the structures. The transmission spectra
of the original slabs exhibit well deﬁned forbidden fre-
quency band gaps, as expected. On the contrary, the
corresponding spectra for the transformed structures ex-
hibit a spiky structure showing many deep peaks corre-
sponding to internal resonances. The more of the lay-
ers in the circular shell the more peaks in the spectrum.
Thus, these conformal structures can be used as ultra-
sonic traps to conﬁne internal modes with a wide and
discrete range of frequencies and as ultrasonic ﬁlters ex-
hibiting very high attenuation for some frequency ranges.
The present conformal device also allows to implement
the important technique that consists of injecting inner
resonances into the cavities of the shells starting from
external point wave sources. Fig.3 (a) shows the ingoing
transmission spectra for the conformal structure. The

the spiral-like defects works as the “Negative-print” or
“mould” of a natural choclea. As an example, in Fig.4(c)
we show the theoretically FEM calculated resonance of
this choclear-like defect corresponding to a frequency of
83 kHz. As it can be seen, the theoretical prediction,
indicated with a little arrow in Fig.4(b), ﬁts with high
accuracy a remarkable peak of the experimental observa-
tion shown in the second curve in Fig.4 (c). Theoretical
and experimental concordance is observed also for the
other resonance peaks.

As conclusion, a conformal mapping of ultrasonic crys-
tals give rise to a variety of interesting acoustic transmis-
sion phenomena.

transmitter source is placed near the external boundary
of the scatterer arrangement and the integrating receiver
circular domain is located just at the center of the cavity.
We have found a rich variety of inner localized modes in-
jected from the external boundary. In Fig.3(b) we show
an example of the injection of an internal resonance in
the conformal shell.

By removing a diagonal line along the [11] direction in
the original rectangular slab, a spiral-like defect is gener-
ated in the conformally mapped structure. In Fig.4(a) we
show the guiding of the wave along these linear defects.
There are a lot of resonance frequencies to localize the
wave along these spiral choclear-like defects. In Fig.4(b)
we show the experimental measurements performed at
four diﬀerent locations along the choclear-like defect gen-
erated in the conformal structure, where the numerical
label of each curve indicates the relative location along
the defect path, from the exterior to the interior. As it
can be seen in the ﬁgure, a clear spatial- frequency se-
lection is achieved. This performance allows us to iden-
tify this wave guide with a device similar to a “synthetic
choclea”, which is able to discriminate and separate dif-
ferent frequencies by exploring the path along the defect
with diﬀerent point receptors for each resonance. So,

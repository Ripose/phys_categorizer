Abstract

The rate of energy dissipation in solutions of the body-forced 3-d incompressible Navier-Stokes

equations is rigorously estimated with a focus on its dependence on the nature of the driving force.

For square integrable body forces the high Reynolds number (low viscosity) upper bound on the

dissipation is independent of the viscosity, consistent with the existence of a conventional turbulent

energy cascade. On the other hand when the body force is not square integrable, i.e., when the

Fourier spectrum of the force decays suﬃciently slowly at high wavenumbers, there is signiﬁcant

direct driving at a broad range of spatial scales. Then the upper limit for the dissipation rate may

diverge at high Reynolds numbers, consistent with recent experimental and computational studies

of “fractal-forced” turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

A fundamental principle of modern hydrodynamic turbulence theory is that nonlinear

interactions between Fourier modes of the velocity ﬁeld can transfer energy from directly-

forced large spatial scales, through the so-called inertial range, down to a small dissipation

length scale where viscosity eﬀectively consumes kinetic energy and transforms it into heat.

This turbulent cascade process has been intensively studied experimentally, numerically, and

theoretically (at various levels of mathematical rigor) since the ﬁrst half of the twentieth

century. See, e.g., the book by Frisch [1] for an introduction and entry into the vast literature

on this subject, which is still the focus of much current research.

One profound consequence of the cascade mechanism is the so-called dissipative anomaly

wherein a ﬁnite and non-vanishing residual energy dissipation persists in the singular limit

of vanishing viscosity,

i.e., in the inﬁnite Reynolds number limit. This phenomenon is

quantitatively described as Kolmogorov scaling of the energy dissipation, namely

β ≡

ǫℓ
U 3 = O(Re0) as Re → ∞

(1)

where ǫ is the total energy dissipation rate per unit mass, ℓ is an integral (large) length scale

in the ﬂow characterizing the domain or a large scale in the forcing and ﬂow, U is a turbulent

velocity scale, and Re = Uℓ/ν is the Reynolds number with ν denoting the kinematic

viscosity. Sreenivasan has collected together relevant data illustrating Kolmogorov scaling

in experiments [2] and direct numerical simulations [3]. Moreover, given precise deﬁnitions

of all the quantities involved, this β ∼ Re0 Kolmogorov scaling has been shown to be an

upper bound for (weak) solutions of the 3-d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations driven

by suﬃciently smooth—in particular, square integrable—body forces [4, 5, 6, 7].

While the cascade picture of turbulence requires that energy be predominantly injected

in a relatively narrow range of spatial scales, some researchers have recently performed

experimental and computational studies of fractal-generated turbulence. These are ﬂows

driven by spatially broadband fractal forces with certain scaling properites that inject energy

directly at a wide range of scales—most notably at small scales that could otherwise only be

excited by the cascade. Such forcing can impose a self-similar structure on the ﬂow that is

independent of the turbulent energy cascade. If such forcing can be achieved experimentally

then one can observe, and in principle control, the balance between the energy that has been

directly injected and the energy transfered by the nonlinear mode interactions.

2

Indeed, Queiros-Conde and Vassilicos [8] performed experiments by forcing ﬂuid past a

fractal object, an obstacle that was structurally self-similar over several scales. Staicu et

al [9] experimentally measured energy spectra and structure functions in the wake of grids

of fractal dimensions 2.05, 2.17, and 2.40 in a wind tunnel, concluding that “there may be

a direct relation between the scaling properties of the fractal object and the turbulence it

creates”. This is more easily investigated in direct numerical simulations where details of

the ﬂow ﬁeld is directly observable.

Mazzi and Vassilicos [10] performed direct numerical simulations of stationary homo-

geneous and isotropic turbulence in a ﬂuid in a 3-d periodic box of size ℓ driven by a

velocity-dependent fractal body force f(x, t) with Fourier components of the form:

|k| > kF

(2)

where ˆuk are the velocity ﬁeld’s Fourier components, ˆfk = 0 whenever ˆuk = 0, and ˆu0 ≡ 0.



The scaling exponent ζ is intended to characterize the fractal properties of the stirrer or

obstacle, and the maximum wavenumber kF is to be thought of as the inverse of the spatial

size of the smallest parts of the fractal stirrer. Mazzi and Vassilicos used numerical values
for which the fractal forcing extended down to scales ∼ k−1

F on the order of the Kolmogorov
dissipation length η ≡ (ν3/ǫ)1/4. They observed that the bulk energy dissipation rate did

not exhibit Kolmogorov scaling β ∼ Re0, but rather β ∼ Re1 corresponding to ǫ ∼ U 4/ν.

Biferale et al [11, 12] performed numerical simulations of the 3-d Navier-Stokes equations

with a stochastic body force that was white-noise in time but with a power law spectrum of

spatial scales ∼ kζ. They investigated small scale turbulent ﬂuctuations and concluded that

the statistics displayed two distinct qualitative behaviors. When the spatial spectrum of

the forcing decayed suﬃciently fast, the small scale ﬂuctuations were universal in the sense

that they were independent of the details of the force spectrum. This regime corresponds

to conventional cascade dynamics. When the spatial spectrum of the forcing decayed more

slowly, however, the small scale ﬂuctuations were “force-dominated” with the cascade being

overwhelmed by the direct excitation from the driving.

Interestingly, they reported that

this transition occurs at a value ζ = − 3

2 of the scaling exponent corresponding to the
boundary between (spatially) square integrable and “rougher” forcing functions without

square summable Fourier coeﬃcients.

In this paper we derive rigorous upper bounds on the bulk energy dissipation ǫ in an

incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid driven by a variety of body forces including forces that are

not square integrable. This work generalizes the previous analysis for square integrable

body forces [4, 5, 7] to include fractal forces that drive the ﬂow directly at a broad range of

scales. In accord with the ﬁndings of Biferale et al we ﬁnd that the case of square integrable

forcing is a borderline situation: β . Re0 when the body forces are square integrable (or

smoother), but the estimates increase for rougher driving so that the dissipation coeﬃcient β

may increase asymptotically as Re → ∞. For the roughest forcing functions that make sense
k k−2|ˆfk|2 < ∞,

mathematically, i.e., forcing functions with Fourier coeﬃcients satisfying

we ﬁnd that β . Re1, the scaling observed by Mazzi et al .

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The following Section II lays out the

mathematical setting for the analysis and gives the deﬁnitions of the physically relevant

quantities of interest.

In Section III we study the case of time-independent body forces,

and the subsequent Section IV deals with velocity-dependent forces like (2). The concluding

Section V contains a brief summary and some closing remarks. For completeness and to

make the paper self-contained, we include some mathematical details in an appendix.

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND DEFINITIONS

Consider the incompressible 3-d Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic domain x ∈ [0, ℓ]3:

∂tu + (u · ∇)u + ∇p = ν∆u + f

(3)

where u(x, t) is the divergence-free velocity ﬁeld, p(x, t) is the pressure, f(x, t) is the applied

body-force, ν > 0 is the kinematic viscosity, and u|t=0 = u0(x) is the initial condition. We

will take the body force to be a speciﬁed time independent (divergence-free) function f(x)

in Section III, or given by a velocity-dependent expression like (2) in Section IV. We write

Fourier expansions as

u(x, t) =

ˆuk(t)eix·k where

ˆuk(t) =

e−ix·ku(x, t)d3x.

Without loss of generality, in every case we will take the applied body force and initial data

to have spatial mean zero so that k = |k| > 0 in all sums.

The index α can be positive or negative and the function spaces H α are nested according to
H α ⊂ H α′

for α > α′. The case α = 0 corresponds to the usual L2 norm (with the volume

normalization) and we write

kukH 0 = kukL2 = kuk

“Fractal” forces are deﬁned as those with power-law Fourier coeﬃcients, |ˆfk| = Ckζ. For
such a function to belong to the Sobelov space H α its exponent must satistfy ζ < −α − 3

i.e., the Fourier coeﬃcients must decay as |ˆfk| . k−α− 3

2 −δ for some δ > 0.

We deﬁne time averages of functions g(t) according to

Z
and for simplicity in this paper we presume that this limit exists for all quantities of interest.

The root means square velocity U of a solution u(x, t) of the Navier-Stokes equations is

When a solution u(x, t) satisﬁes the energy equality (i.e., when the energy is absolutely

(cid:10)

continuous, which holds for every regular solution), the energy dissipation rate satisﬁes

That is, the power supplied by the driving force is balanced by the viscous dissipation.

Weak solutions to these 3-d Navier-Stokes equations exist for f ∈ H −1, and then in

general the relation in (11) is only an inequality, i.e., ǫ ≤ hf · ui [13, 14, 15]. This fact does

not aﬀect our results, however, because we will just derive upper limits on ǫ. Moreover,

(6)

the assumption of the existence of the long times averages is not necessary if the limit is

replaced by lim supT →∞. With that deﬁnition the estimates we derive are fully applicable

to weak solutions.

Using the deﬁnitions above, the Reynolds number is identiﬁed Re = Uℓ/ν and the dis-

sipation coeﬃcient as β = ǫℓ/U 3.

In the scenario described here both Re (or U) and β

(or ǫ) are formally “emergent” quantities, not directly controllable but determined rather

as functions of ℓ and ν and functionals of u0 and f. These bulk averaged quantities gener-

ally depend on u0, but the relationships derived below are uniformly valid for all solutions

regardless of initial data so we will drop any further reference to them.

In practice one

assumes that the parameters of the force, e.g., its amplitude, can be tuned to achieve any

desired Reynolds number. Then β may be considered a function of Re. The overdamped

highly viscous limit is Re → 0 and the vanishing viscosity limit is explored as Re → ∞.

Some very general statements can be made for the overdamped limit. Poincare’s inequal-

ity implies that

This Reynolds number scaling is sharp: as will be seen below, for a wide variety of forces

there exists a constant c ≥ 4π2 (generally depending on the details of the forcing) such that

This scaling, β ∼ Re−1, is characteristic of large scale laminar ﬂows where the typical rate

of strain is proportional to U/ℓ and the typical stress is proportional to νU/ℓ.

For higher Reynolds numbers the lower estimate in (13) can generally not be improved.

That is, at arbitrarily high Re there are forces that can sustain the ﬂow with β ∼ Re−1.

Those ﬂows—which may be unstable—are necessarily suﬃciently laminar to exclude any

characterization as being turbulent. The upper bound on β, however, necessarily increases

above Re−1 as Re → ∞. For turbulent ﬂows with an eﬀective energy cascade the dissipation

becomes independent of ν as Re → ∞, i.e., β ∼ Re0, as evidenced by experiments and direct

numerical simulations. But for suﬃciently broadband forcing β may increase indeﬁnitely in

this limit, and the task of the next two sections is to place rigorous upper bounds on β as

6

a function of Re for ﬂows driven by fractal forces.

III. STEADY H −α BODY FORCES

In this section we generalize the approach introduced by Doering & Foias [4]—an approach

that was inspired by previous work of Foias and coworkers [16, 17, 18]—to cases where the

time independent force f(x) ∈ H −α with α ∈ [0, 1]. For α ≤ 0 the force f ∈ L2 and the

β . Re0 upper bound, corresponding to the usual energy cascade, is eﬀective [4]. We do

not consider values of α > 1, for then even weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations

are not known to exist. While the analysis in this section is not restricted to strictly fractal
forces, the results apply nevertheless to those with power-law Fourier coeﬃcients |ˆfk| ∼ kζ
where ζ = α − 3

2 − δ for any δ > 0.
Write the steady body force as

where F is the amplitude of the force, the H −α norm of f, and the “shape” function φ is a

dimensionless divergence-free ﬁeld on the unit 3-torus normalized according to

f(x) = F φ(ℓ−1x),

kφkH −α = 1.

On the other hand we can also estimate F from above independently in terms of U, ν

divergence-free function ψ(ℓ−1x) on the unit 3-torus satisfying hφ · ψi > 0. (It’s easy to

produce such ﬁelds ψ, for example as a ﬁnite Fourier mode Galerkin truncation of φ.)

ˆfk(t) = F (ℓ|k|)ζ−δ

ˆuk
|ˆuk|
(cid:18)
2] and δ > 0 and ˆfk ≡ 0 whenever ˆuk = 0. The

where F is the strength coeﬃcient, ζ ∈ [− 3

an autonomous system. We assume initial data u0(x) 6= 0, that a (statistically) steady ﬂow

is subsequently sustained, and that for t > 0 each |ˆuk(t)| = 0 only on a measure-zero set of
2 corresponds to the case where the forcing is in H −1 at

times. The scaling exponent ζ = − 1

each instant of time for all δ > 0, while ζ = − 3

2 (or less) is L2 (or smoother) forcing.

V. SUMMARY & DISCUSSION

In this paper we generalized the analysis that was previously employed for square inte-

grable (or smoother) steady forces [4] and velocity-dependent forces [7] to derive bounds on

the energy dissipation in the case of broad-band and fractally-forced ﬂow described by the

incompressible 3-d Navier-Stokes equations. When a steady body-force f(x) ∈ H −α with

α ∈ [0, 1], we showed that the dimensionless dissipation factor β(Re) is limited according to

remark that the scalings in (46) and (47) are clearly consistent with each other when it is
recognized that forces with |ˆfk| ∼ kζ−δ are in H −α when ζ = α − 3

In terms of dimensional physical quantities, we have estimated the energy dissipation rate

(per unit mass) ǫ in terms of the rms velocity U, ℓ and ν. Laminar dissipation corresponds

to ǫ ∼ νU 2/ℓ2 while the turbulent cascade is characterized by ǫ ∼ U 3/ℓ and the roughest

fractal forces may allows ǫ ∼ U 4/ν. But for a speciﬁed form of the body force it is natural

to consider ǫ and U as functions of the forcing amplitude F , ℓ and ν [19]. When the force

is speciﬁed, rather than the rms velocity, it is well known (and easy to show) that the

Stokes ﬂow driven by the given force sets an upper limit for the dissipation rate; any other

ﬂow necessarily dissipates less energy. In terms of the F , ℓ and ν, the maximal Stokes ﬂow

dissipation is ǫ ∼ F 2ℓ2/ν which may be interpreted as a laminar ﬂow bound. It is interesting

to note that in the extreme limits of H −1 forcing in (17) and ζ = − 1

2 in (32), the scaling in

this laminar upper limit is reproduced explicitly.

APPENDIX A: INEQUALITIES

For convenience, in this appendix we collect the mathematical estimates used here:

(a) Jensen’s inequality: If the real-valued function of a real variable θ(x) is convex, then

for each real-valued function g

where h·i stands for averaging. In particular, for any nonnegative function g and any

θ(hgi) ≤ hθ ◦ gi ,

hgpi ≤ hgip .

real number p ∈ [0, 1],

(b) H¨older’s inequality:

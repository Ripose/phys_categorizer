Abstract

We use the fractional integrals in order to describe dynamical processes in the fractal
media. We consider the ”fractional” continuous medium model for the fractal media
and derive the fractional generalization of the equations of balance of mass density,
momentum density, and internal energy. The fractional generalization of Navier-Stokes
and Euler equations are considered. We derive the equilibrium equation for fractal
media. The sound waves in the continuous medium model for fractional media are
considered.

1 Introduction

The pore space of real media is characterized by an extremely complex and irregular geometry
[1, 2, 3]. Because the methods of Euclidean geometry, which ordinarily deals with regular
sets, are purely suited for describing objects such as in nature, stochastic models are taken
into account [4]. Another possible way of describing a complex structure of the pore space
is to use fractal theory of sets of fractional dimensionality [5]-[8]. Although, the fractal
dimensionality does not reﬂect completely the geometric and dynamic properties of the
fractal, it nevertheless permits a number of important conclusions about the behavior of
fractal structures. For example, if it is assumed that matter with a constant density is
distributed over the fractal, then the mass of the fractal enclosed in a volume of characteristic
RD , whereas for a regular n-dimensional
dimension R satisﬁes the scaling law M(R)
Rn. Let us assume that a network of pore channels can be treated
Euclidean object M(R)
on a scale R as a stochastic fractal of dimensionality D < 3 embedded in a Euclidean space of
dimensionality n = 3. Naturally, in real objects the fractal structure cannot be observed on
all scales but only those for which Rp < R < R0, where Rp is the characteristic dimensionality
of the pore channel, and R0 is the macroscopic scale for uniformity of the investigated
structure and processes. For example, Katz and Thompson [10] presented experimental
evidence indicating that the pore spaces of a set of sandstone samples are fractals in length
extending from 10 angstrom to 100 µm.

The natural question arises: what happens to the ”laws of ﬂuid ﬂow” when the medium
through which the ﬂuid actually ﬂows is fractional? The scientiﬁc reason for our interest
in this topic is immediately obvious: the laws associated with ﬂuid ﬂow through fractional
media are only beginning to be understood [5]-[9].

In the general case, the fractal media cannot be considered as continuous media. There
are points and domains that are not ﬁlled of the medium particles. These domains are the
porous. We suggest to consider the fractal media as special (fractional) continuous media
[24]. We use the procedure of replacement of the fractal medium with fractal mass dimension
by some continuous medium that is described by fractional integrals. This procedure is a
fractional generalization of Christensen approach [11]. Suggested procedure leads to the
fractional integration and diﬀerentiation to describe fractal media. The fractional integrals
allow us to take into account the fractality of the media. In order to describe the fractal
medium by continuous medium model we must use the fractional integrals.

In many problems the real fractal structure of matter can be disregarded and the medium
can be replaced by some ”fractional” continuous mathematical model. In order to describe
the medium with non-integer mass dimension, we must use the fractional calculus. Smooth-
ing of the microscopic characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume, we transform
the initial fractal medium into ”fractional” continuous model that uses the fractional inte-
grals. The order of fractional integral is equal to the fractal mass dimension of the medium.
More consistent approach to describe the fractal media is connected with the mathemat-
ical deﬁnition the integrals on fractals. In [12], was proved that integrals on net of fractals
can be approximated by fractional integrals. In [13], we proved that fractional integrals can
be considered as integrals over the space with fractional dimension up to numerical factor.
To prove we use the well-known formulas of dimensional regularizations [14].

The fractional continuous models of fractal media can have a wide application. This
is due in part to the relatively small numbers of parameters that deﬁne a random fractal
medium of great complexity and rich structure. The fractional continuous model allows us to
describe dynamics of wide class of fractal media. Fractional integrals can be used to derive
the fractional generalization of the equations of balance for the fractal media.

In this paper, we use the fractional integrals in order to describe dynamical processes in
the fractal media. In section 2, we consider the ”fractional” continuous medium model for
the fractal medium. In section 3-5, we derive the fractional generalization of the equations
of balance of mass density, momentum density, and internal energy. In section 6, the frac-
tional generalization of Navier-Stokes and Euler equations are considered. In section 7, we
derive the equilibrium equation for fractal media. In section 8, we consider the fractional
generalization of Bernoulli integral. In section 9, the sound waves in the continuous medium
model for fractional media are considered. Finally, a short conclusion is given in section 10.

2 Fractal Media and Fractional Integrals

The cornerstone of fractals is the meaning of dimension, speciﬁcally the fractal dimension.
Fractal dimension can be best calculated by box counting method which means drawing a
box of size R and counting the mass inside. The mass fractal dimension [21, 22] can be easy
measured for fractal media.

The properties of the fractal media like mass obeys a power law relation

M(R) = kRD,

(D < 3),

(1)

where M is the mass of fractal medium, R is a box size (or a sphere radius), and D is a
mass fractal dimension. Amount of mass of a medium inside a box of size R has a power
law relation (1).

The power law relation (1) can be naturally derived by using the fractional integral.
In this section, we prove that the mass fractal dimension is connected with the order of
fractional integrals. Therefore, the fractional integrals can be used to describe fractal media
with non-integer mass dimensions.

Let us consider the region WA in three-dimensional Euclidean space E3, where A is the
midpoint of this region. The volume of the region WA is denoted by V (WA). If the region
WA is a ball with the radius RA, then the midpoint A is a center of the ball, and the volume
V (WA) = (4/3)πR3
A . The mass of the region WA in the fractal medium is denoted by
MD(WA), where D is a mass dimension of the medium.

The fractality of medium means that the mass of this medium in any region WA of
Euclidean space E3 increase more slowly that the volume of this region. For the ball region
of the fractal media, this property can be described by the power law (1), where R is the
radius of the ball WA that is much more than the mean radius Rp of the porous sphere.

Fractal media are called homogeneous fractal media if the power law (1) does not depends
on the translation and rotation of the region. The homogeneity property of the media can
be formulated in the form: For all regions WA and WB of the homogeneous fractal media
such that the volumes are equal V (WA) = V (WB), we have that the mass of these regions
are equal MD(WA) = MD(WB). Note that the wide class of the fractal media satisﬁes the
homogeneous property. In many cases, we can consider the porous media [15, 16], polymers
[17], colloid agregates [18], and aerogels [19] as homogeneous fractal media.

To describe the fractal medium, we must use the continuous medium model such that

the fractality and homogeneity properties can be realized in the form:

(1) Fractality: The mass of the ball region W of fractal medium obeys a power law relation

3 Equation of Balance of Mass Density

The fractional integrals can be used not only to calculate the mass dimensions of fractal
media. Fractional integration can be used to describe the dynamical processes in the fractal
media. Using fractional integrals, we can derive the fractional generalization of dynamical
equations [13, 23]. In this section, we derive the fractional analog of the equation of continuity
for the fractal media.

Let us consider the region W of the medium. The boundary of this region is denoted
by ∂W . Suppose the medium in the region W has the mass dimension D. In general, the
medium on the boundary ∂W has the dimension d. In the general case, the dimension d is
not equal to 2 and is not equal to (D

1).

The balance of the mass density is described by the equation

Here, and late we use the initial points in the integrals are set to zero (r0 = 0). The integral
(8) is considered for the region W which moves with the medium. The ﬁeld of the velocity
is denoted by u = u(R, t). The total time derivative of the volume integral is deﬁned by the
equation

Here, un is deﬁned by un = (u, n) = uknk, the vector u = ukek is a velocity ﬁeld, and
n = nkek is a vector of normal. The surface integral for the boundary ∂W can be represented
as a volume integral for the region W . To realize the representation, we derive the fractional
generalization of the Gauss theorem (see Appendix). As the result, we have the following

In addition to mass density ρ, the continuity equation includes the density of momentum
ρu. To obtain the equation for the density of momentum, we consider the mass force and
surface force.

Let the force f = fkek be a function of the space-time point (R, t). The force FM , that acts

vector of normal.

Let P be a momentum of the medium mass that is situated in the region W .

If the
mass dMD(W ) = ρ(R, t)dVD moves with the velocity u, than the momentum of this mass
is dP = dMD(W )u = ρudVD. The momentum P of the mass of the region W is deﬁned by

to the hydrodynamic ﬁelds ρ(R, t), u(R, t), e(R, t), include also the tensor of viscous stress
pkl(R, t) and the vector of thermal ﬂux qk(R, t).

Let us start with the deﬁnition of tensor pkl = pkl(R, t). According to Newton’s law,
the force of viscous friction is proportional to the relative velocity of motion of medium
layers (that is to the gradient of the relevant component of velocity). We further assume
that tensor pkl(R, t) is symmetrical, and characterizes the dissipation due to viscous friction.
The most general form of tensor of viscous stress, which satisﬁes the above requirements, is
determined by two constants (µ and ξ) which can be chosen so that

(cid:17)

This expression contains a second coeﬃcient of viscosity ξ, called the coeﬃcient of inter-
nal viscosity because it reﬂects the existence of internal structure of particles. In case of
structureless particles ξ = 0.

The deﬁnition of the vector of heat ﬂux qk = qk(R, t), is based on the empirical Fourier

law

qk =

where T = T (R, t) is the ﬁeld of temperature. The value of heat conductivity λ can be
found experimentally.

Now we have a closed set of Eqs. (37)-(39), (42), and (43) for ﬁelds ρ(R, t), uk(R, t),
T (R, t) - a set of fractional equations of hydrodynamics. The fractional generalization of the
equations of theory of elasticity for solids can be obtained in a similar way.

Let us consider the special cases of the set of Eqs. (37)-(39), (42), and (43).
1. Let us consider the ﬂuids that are deﬁned by

11 Conclusion

The fractional continuous models of fractal media can have a wide application. This is due
in part to the relatively small numbers of parameters that deﬁne a random fractal medium of
great complexity and rich structure. The fractional continuous model allows us to describe
dynamics for wide class fractal media.

In many problems the real fractal structure of matter can be disregarded and the medium
can be replaced by some ”fractional” continuous mathematical model. To describe the
medium with non-integer mass dimension, we must use the fractional calculus. Smoothing
of the microscopic characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume transform the
initial fractal medium into ”fractional” continuous model that uses the fractional integrals.
The order of fractional integral is equal to the fractal mass dimension of the medium.

The experimental research of the hydrodynamics of fractal media can be realized by
introducing a neutral indicator, its distribution. It allows one to obtain much information
on the motion and mixing of ﬂuid. The fractal nature of damage and porosity has been
experimentally detected over a wide range of scales.

Note that the fractional hydrodynamic equations for fractal media can be derived from

the fractional generalization of the Bogoliubov equations that are suggested in [23].

I would like to thank Prof. G.M. Zaslavsky for very useful discussions.

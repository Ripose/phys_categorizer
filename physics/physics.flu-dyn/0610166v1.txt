[Almost identical to PRL 97, 094502 (2006)] We studied spark-generated cavitation bubbles in-
side water drops produced in microgravity. High-speed visualizations disclosed unique eﬀects of the
spherical and nearly isolated liquid volume. In particular, (1) toroidally collapsing bubbles generate
two liquid jets escaping from the drop, and the ”splash jet” discloses a remarkable broadening. (2)
Shockwaves induce a strong form of secondary cavitation due to the particular shockwave conﬁne-
ment. This feature oﬀers a novel way to estimate integral shockwave energies in isolated volumes.
(3) Bubble lifetimes in drops are shorter than in extended volumes in remarkable agreement with
herein derived corrective terms for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

Introduction − Hydrodynamic cavitation is a ma-
jor source of erosion damage in many industrial sys-
tems, such as fast ship propellers, cryogenic pumps,
pipelines, and turbines [1]. Yet, controlled cavitation-
erosion proves a powerful tool for modern technolo-
gies like ultrasonic cleaning [2], eﬀective salmonella
destruction [3], and treatment for kidney stones [4].
Such erosion is associated with liquid jets and shock-
waves emitted by collapsing cavitation bubbles, but
the relative importance of these two processes remains
a topic of debate [5]. Fundamental understanding re-
quires studies of single bubbles in diﬀerent liquid ge-
ometries, since bubble dynamics strongly depends on
nearby surfaces by means of boundary conditions im-
posed on the surrounding pressure ﬁeld [1, 6]. Re-
cent investigations revealed interesting characteristics
of bubbles collapsing next to ﬂat [7] and curved [8]
rigid surfaces or ﬂat free surfaces [9, 10]. It is thus a
promising idea to study bubbles inside spherical drops
and probe their interaction with closed spherical free
surfaces. However, for centimeter-sized volumes, such
geometries are inaccessible in the presence of gravity
and require a microgravity environment, even though
gravity plays a negligible direct role for most single
bubble phenomena.

In this letter, we present the ﬁrst experimental study
of single bubble dynamics inside centimetric quasi-
spherical water drops produced in microgravity. High-
speed imaging revealed key-implications of nearly iso-
liquid volumes on bubble
lated, ﬁnite and spherical
evolution and subsequent phenomena. The results will
be presented in three steps covering (1) jet dynamics,
(2) shockwave eﬀects and (3) spherical collapse.

Experimental Setup (for a detailed description and
ﬁgures see [11]) − Microgravity was achieved in
manned parabolic ﬂights conducted by the Euro-
pean Space Agency ESA (42nd parabolic ﬂight cam-

paign). The nominal ﬂight manoeuvres oﬀer sequences
(i.e. parabolas) of 20 s of weightlessness with a residual
g-jitter of 0.02-0.05 g at typical frequencies of 1-10 Hz.
Our experiment and all calibrations were carried out
on 93 parabolas on three consecutive ﬂight days.

Each parabola was used to run one fully auto-
mated experimental cycle, consisting in the computer-
controlled growth of a centimetric water drop and the
generation of a single bubble inside the drop. The
liquid was expelled though an injector tube, specially
designed to ﬁx and stabilize the ensuing truncated
drop (Fig. 1). The bubble was generated through a
spark-discharge between two thin electrodes immersed
in the drop. A high-speed CCD-camera (Photron Ul-
tima APX, up to 120 000 frames/s) recorded the fast
bubble dynamics for a sequence of 11 ms. Three pa-
rameters were independently adjustable: (1) the initial
drop size [radius Rd,min = 8-13 mm] by changing the
expelled water volume, (2) the maximal bubble size
[radius Rb,max = 2-10 mm] by altering the discharge
energy between 8 and 1000 mJ, (3) the distance d be-
tween drop center and bubble center by precisely ad-
justing the electrodes position. We shall usually de-
scribe a particular setting in the dimensionless param-
eter space (α, ε), where α ≡ Rb,max/Rd,min (relative
bubble radius), ε ≡ d/Rd,min (eccentricity).

Jet Dynamics − As a ﬁrst result, we overview the
collapse of eccentrically placed cavitation bubbles in
the parameter range (0.2 < α < 0.6, 0.3 < ε < 0.8),
recorded at 24 000 frames/s (extracts in Fig. 1). The
nearby free surface breaks the spherical symmetry
leading to a toroidal implosion [9] with a fast micro-
jet (> 50 m/s) directed perpendicularly away from the
closest surface element (Fig. 1b). This microjet ac-
celerates the surrounding volume forming a jet that
escapes from the right surface in the ﬁgure at a re-

splash escapes in the opposite direction (Fig. 1c). This
double-jet picture is consistent with established studies
of bubbles in the vicinity of free surfaces [9, 12], and
provides the ﬁrst direct visualization of both bubble-
induced jets escaping from a steady liquid volume.

Close investigation of the splash geometry revealed
a remarkable and reproducible diameter broadening
compared to similar jets on ground-based ﬂat
free
surfaces (Fig. 2a,c).
In the latter case, the narrow-
ness is due to a very localized high-pressure peak be-
tween bubble and free surface [9]. We believe that
this pressure peak is much broader beneath spherical
free surfaces, since the distance between bubble bound-
ary and surface varies more smoothly. Such a pressure
zone broadening suggests an explanation for a broader
splash and will be subject to forthcoming simulations.
Additionally, we discovered that the typical crown sur-
rounding the splash on ﬂat surfaces (Fig. 2c) is absent
on the spherical surface (Fig. 2a). For comparison it is
enlightening to consider cylindrical free surfaces, which
are straight and circular in two orthogonal directions.
One might reason that such surfaces exhibit a hybrid
behavior between (a) and (c). Indeed, recent studies
of bubbles inside a falling water stream [13] revealed
a non-circular crown consisting of two spikes in the
straight direction of the surface, while no crown seems
present perpendicular to the ﬁgure (Fig. 2b). These
observations deﬁnitely disclose non-trivial features in
splash dynamics and crown formation and promise an
interesting avenue for future research.

Shockwave Eﬀects − Many high-speed visualizations
contain isolated frames showing a short-lived brilliant
mist (Fig. 3). This mist lasts for roughly 50 µs and
is visibly composed of sub-millimetric bubbles (here
called microbubbles). Strikingly, these mists exactly
coincide with the instants of predicted shockwave ra-
diation. Namely, the spark (or primary) shockwave is
emitted at the spark generation initiating the bubble
growth, and collapse (or secondary) shockwaves are
radiated at the bubble collapse and subsequent col-

lapses of rebound bubbles [14]. Although these shock-
waves were not directly observable with the present
setup, their exact synchronization with microbubbles
clearly discloses a causal relation. We claim that the
mist of microbubbles is a strong form of shockwave-
induced secondary cavitation [15]. In other words, mi-
crobubbles are small cavitation bubbles inside the drop
volume, arising from the excitation of nuclei (i.e. mi-
croscopic impurities and dissolved gas) at the passage
of shockwaves [16, 17]. That the microbubbles were
indeed cavities was conﬁrmed by showing that their
size/lifetime ratio matches theoretical cavity life cy-
cles.

The surprisingly high abundance of microbubbles
compared to faint traces seen in ground experiments
[15] is reasonably explained by a unique shockwave con-
ﬁnement in the case of isolated liquid volumes. The
shockwave can be reﬂected many times on the free
surface and thereby transfer its whole energy to mi-
crobubbles via multiple excitations. This full energy
transformation oﬀers a new way to estimate integral
shockwave energies. The idea consists in integrating
the energies of all microbubbles, which can be inferred
from statistical measures of their densities and maxi-
mal volumes Vmax via E = Vmax(p∞ − pV ) [18], where
p∞ is the ambient static pressure and pV is the vapor
pressure. Applying this method to ﬁve concrete sam-
ples showed that 50-70% of the initial electrical energy
(200 mJ) is contained in the mist of microbubbles as-
sociated with the spark shock. It follows that 50-70%
of the spark energy is radiated in a shockwave, and
we expect to ﬁnd the remaining 30-50% in the main
bubble; a prediction which is consistent with the mea-
sured maximal main bubble volume corresponding to a
bubble energy of 70 mJ. The actual precision was lim-
ited by the optical resolution and non-vanishing con-
tact surfaces (injector tube, electrodes), and could be
improved in forthcoming studies.

Spherical Collapse − We shall now investigate the
collapse of bubbles centered in drops (ε = 0), since
their spherical symmetry allows a direct comparison
to bubbles in inﬁnite volumes, governed by Rayleigh-

Plesset’s theory [18, 19]. Bubbles in drops were found
to collapse faster in excellent agreement with a the-
oretical extension derived in the following. Note that
gravity does not play a direct role in Rayleigh-Plesset’s
theory, nor in our extension, but its absence allowed
the realization of isolated drops with centimetric di-
ameters.

In the present approach we neglect surface ten-
sion, liquid compressibility, viscosity and mass transfer
across the bubble boundary. We further assume a uni-
form and constant temperature, and take the pressure
inside the bubble as the vapor pressure pV . The ensu-
ing simpliﬁed Rayleigh(-Plesset) equation for a spheri-
cal bubble with radius Rb(t) in an inﬁnite liquid reads

Rb(0) = Rb,max and ˙Rb(0) = 0 yields the radius Rb(t)

TRayl ≈ 0.915Rb,max
ρ/∆p [18]. To compare diﬀer-
ent bubble collapses, we present their functions Rb(t)
in normalized scales where TRayl and Rb,max equal one.
In these scales, Rb(t) can be shown to be indepen-
dent of ∆p, ρ and Rb,max. To assert the validity of
the above model for the present situation, we carried
out extensive ground-studies with millimetric bubbles
in extended water volumes. The data revealed excel-
lent agreement with the theoretical prediction (Fig. 4,
dashed line and squares), thus justifying the above as-
sumptions.

In microgravity, we studied bubbles centered in
drops with a relative radius α = 0.50 (Rb,max =
4.07 mm, Rd,min = 8.15 mm, cabin pressure p∞ =
80 000 Pa, spark energy = 200 mJ). The bubble col-
lapses were sampled at 50 000 frames/s with an optical
resolution of 70 µm. Given this high spatiotemporal
resolution, the results from 5 experimental runs were
indistinguishable and ensured reproducibility. The col-
lapse time was measured as 330±10µs and the evolving
bubble radius Rb(t) was reconstituted from the images
using a model of optical refraction by a water sphere

In order to explain this shortening, we shall now
derive an equation of motion for cavitation bubbles of
radius Rb(t) centered in spherical drops of radius Rd(t),
using the above assumptions. Incompressibility links

For the sake of physical interpretation, we derive the
equation of motion from energy conservation. The ki-
netic energy results from integrating the energy density

2 ρ ˙r2 over the whole liquid volume and the potential
energy is given by integrating the pressure work pdV
over the volume traversed by the bubble surface and
the drop surface. Using (2) and (3),

where the term in λ4 was obtained by substituting ˙Rd
using relation (2). This equation comprises the sim-
pliﬁed Rayleigh-Plesset equation (1) and three novel
corrective terms, which vanish as Rd → ∞. Up to the
factor 4πρ ˙RbR2
b the two terms in λ subtract the change
of kinetic energy associated with the volume outside
the drop (Rd(t) < r < ∞), which needs to be removed

from the inﬁnite medium of Rayleigh’s model. The re-
maining corrective term in λ4 accounts for the change
in kinetic energy due to the variation of the drop’s ra-
dius. This term becomes negligible for relative bubble
radii α ≪ 1 since λ(t) < α ∀ t. Integrating (5) with
the initial conditions Rb(0) = Rb,max and ˙Rb(0) = 0
gives the collapsing bubble radius Rb(t), which is in ex-
cellent agreement with the microgravity data (Fig. 4,
solid line). This proves that the shortened lifetime is
entirely due to the ﬁnite spherical drop volume, and
validates the derived equation of motion for bubbles
centered in spherical drops (5).

Finally, we apply the validated model to predict the
collapse times of bubbles with arbitrary relative radii
α. The energy conservation Ekin + Epot = E0 can
be solved for ˙Rb, if E0 is identiﬁed with the potential
energy at maximal bubble radius Rb,max,

pends on α through a collapse factor ξ(α) plotted in

cover the Rayleigh collapse factor ξ(0) = 0.915 [18].
ξ(α) decreases monotonically with increasing relative
bubble radius α, and tends to 0 for α → ∞. Even
though this limit could not be probed in the micro-
gravity time available, it seems non-physical for it vi-

the drop’s surface velocity ˙Rd(t) would approach the
speed of sound for a signiﬁcant fraction of the collapse
phase [use (6), (2)], thus implying a strong pressure
drop and preventing further acceleration.

Conclusion − Microgravity conditions proved essen-
tial in the study of cavitation bubbles inside centri-
metric water drops. In particular, (1) we obtained the
ﬁrst simultaneous visualizations of both cavity-induced
liquid jets, and discovered a remarkable splash broad-
ening and missing crown formation on spherical sur-
faces. (2) Reﬂected shockwaves led to a strong form of
secondary cavitation and oﬀer an original way for the
measurement of shockwave energies inside isolated vol-
umes. (3) Our Rayleigh-Plesset-like model for bubbles
in drops is in excellent agreement with speciﬁc experi-
ments and allowed a general prediction of bubble col-
lapse times in drops. Forthcoming microgravity studies
could fruitfully address the limit of large bubble radii
(α ≫ 1), or focus on direct shockwave visualizations.

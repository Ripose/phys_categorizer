On the Viscosity of Emulsions

(2 February 2008)

Combining direct computations with invariance arguments, Taylor’s constitutive equation for an
emulsion can be extrapolated to high shear rates. We show that the resulting expression is con-
sistent with the rigorous limits of small drop deformation and that it bears a strong similarity
to an a priori unrelated rheological quantity, namely the dynamic (frequency dependent) linear
shear response. More precisely, within a large parameter region the nonlinear steady–state shear
viscosity is obtained from the real part of the complex dynamic viscosity, while the ﬁrst normal
stress difference is obtained from its imaginary part. Our experiments with a droplet phase of
a binary polymer solution (alginate/caseinate) can be interpreted by an emulsion analogy. They
indicate that the predicted similarity rule generalizes to the case of moderately viscoelastic con-
stituents that obey the Cox–Merz rule.

1. Introduction

Apart from their technological importance, emulsions have served as model systems accessi-
ble to rigorous theoretical modeling. The study of emulsions consisting of droplets of a liquid
dispersed in another liquid has thus contributed substantially to our understanding of the rhe-
ology of complex ﬂuids. However, although major theoretical achievements date back to the
beginning of the 20th century, further progress turned out to be difﬁcult. The macroscopic rheo-
logical properties of emulsions are determined by the reaction of the individual drops to the ﬂow
ﬁeld, which in turn is modiﬁed by the presence of other drops. The mutual hydrodynamic in-
teractions of drops complicates substantially the mathematical description. Moreover, depending
on system parameters and ﬂow type, droplets may break under steady ﬂow conditions if a certain
critical strain rate is exceeded. Rigorous calculations of the constitutive equation have therefore
concentrated on very dilute emulsions and on conditions where drops are only weakly deformed.
Sometimes, however, it is desirable to have an approximate expression, which — though not
rigorous — can serve for practical purposes as a quantitative description in the parameter region
beyond the ideal limits. As far as the dependence of the viscoelastic properties of an emulsion
on the volume fraction f of the dispersed phase is concerned, such an approximation has been
given by Oldroyd (1953). It is not rigorous beyond ﬁrst order in f but serves well some practical
purposes even at rather high volume fractions. It seems not reasonable to look for a comparably
simple approximation for the dependence of shear viscosity h on shear rate ˙g
that covers the
whole range of parameters, where all kinds of difﬁcult break–up scenarios are known to occur.
In the next section, we propose instead a less predictive expression which contains an average
drop size R (that may change with shear rate) as a phenomenological parameter. The latter has
to be determined independently either from theory or experiment. It turns out, however, that for
a substantial range of viscosity ratios and shear rates, the expression for h (˙g ) is to a large extent
independent of morphology. For conditions, where drops do not break outside this region, we
point out a similarity relation between this expression and the frequency dependent viscoelastic

moduli G′(w ), G′′(w ), similar to the Cox–Merz rule in polymer physics. More precisely, we show
that in the limit of small drop deformation, the constitutive equation of an emulsion composed
of Newtonian constituents of equal density can be obtained from the frequency dependent linear
response to leading order in capillary number C and (reciprocal) viscosity ratio l −
1. And we
argue that the identiﬁcation is likely to represent a good approximation beyond this limit in a
larger part of the C
l parameter plane. Experimentally, this similarity relation can be tested
directly, without interference of theoretical modeling, by comparing two independent sets of rhe-
ological data. In summary, our theoretical discussion provokes two major empirical questions.
(1) If drops break: does the expression for the viscosity derived in Eq.(2.18) describe the data
with R the average drop size at a given shear rate? (2) If drops do not break below a certain char-
acteristic capillary number C∗(l ): does the proposed similarity rule hold? To what extent does it
generalize to non–Newtonian constituents? In Section 3 we address mainly the second question
by experiments with a quasi–static droplet phase of a mixture of moderately viscoelastic polymer
solutions.

2. Theory

2.1. Taylor’s constitutive equation for emulsions

A common way to characterize the rheological properties of complex ﬂuids such as emulsions,
suspensions, and polymer solutions, is by means of a constitutive equation or an equation of
state that relates the components pi j + pd
i j of the stress tensor to the rate–of–strain tensor ei j.
This relation can account for all the internal heterogeneity and the complexity and interactions of
the constituents if only the system may be represented as a homogeneous ﬂuid on macroscopic
scales. The form of possible constitutive equations is restricted by general symmetry arguments,
which provide guidelines for the construction of phenomenological expressions (Oldroyd 1950,
1958). On the other hand, for special model systems the constitutive equations may be calculated
directly at least for some restricted range of parameters. An early example for a direct computa-
tion of the constitutive equation of a complex ﬂuid is Einstein’s formula

p12/e12 of a dilute suspension (particle volume fraction f

for the shear viscosity h
1). It is
obtained by solving Stokes’ equation for an inﬁnite homogeneous ﬂuid of viscosity h c containing
a single solid sphere. For a sufﬁciently dilute suspension, the contributions of different particles
to the overall viscosity h can be added independently, giving an effect proportional to f
. In close
analogy Taylor (1932) calculated h
for a steadily sheared dilute suspension of droplets of an
incompressible liquid of viscosity h d
c in another incompressible liquid of viscosity h c. For
weakly deformed drops he obtained

which we abbreviate by h T in the following. This expression includes Einstein’s result as the
limiting case of a highly viscous droplet, l
. As in Einstein’s calculation, interactions of
the drops are neglected. The result is independent of surface tension s
, shear rate ˙g , and drop
radius R; i.e., it is a mere consequence of the presence of a certain amount f of dispersed drops,
regardless of drop size and deformation (as long as the latter is small). Moreover, the dynamic
(frequency dependent) linear response of an emulsion has been calculated by Oldroyd (1953).
His results are quoted in section 2.4 below.

also introduced by Taylor (1934). It appears as dimensionless expansion parameter in a perturba-
tion series of the drop shape under shear. To derive Taylor’s Eq.(2.2) it is sufﬁcient to represent
the drops by their spherical equilibrium shape. Aiming to improve the constitutive equation,
Schowalter, Chaffey & Brenner (1968) took into account deformations of drops to ﬁrst order
in C . The reﬁned analysis did not affect the off–diagonal elements of the constitutive equation,
i.e. Taylor’s Eq.(2.2) for the viscosity, but it gave the (unequal) normal stresses to order O(C ˙g ).
Another limit, where exact results can be obtained, is the limit of large viscosity ratios l
(Frankel & Acrivos 1970; Rallison 1980). To clarify the physical signiﬁcance of the different
limits we want to give a brief qualitative description of the behavior of a suspended drop under
shear, based on work by Oldroyd (1953) and Rallison (1980).

In a quiescent matrix ﬂuid of viscosity h c, a single weakly deformed drop relaxes exponen-
tially into its spherical equilibrium shape; i.e., deﬁning dimensionless deformation by D :=

also characterizes the macroscopic stress relaxation in an unstrained region of a dilute emulsion.
At w
1 one observes the characteristic relaxation mode in the frequency dependent moduli.
The relaxation time diverges for l /s
since it takes longer for a weak surface tension to
drive a viscous drop back to equilibrium. What happens if the matrix is steadily sheared at shear
rate ˙g ? For ˙g
1, the ﬂow induced in the drop by the external driving is weak compared to the
internal relaxation dynamics and the equilibrium state is only slightly disturbed, i.e., the drop is
only weakly deformed. Similarly, for large viscosity ratio l
, the elongation of the drop becomes
very slow compared to vorticity, and hence again very small in the steady state, even if t 1˙g
is not
small. Technically, this is due to the asymptotic proportionality to l −
1 of the shear rate within the
drop. In both limits of weak deformation, the time t 1 also controls the orientation of the major
axis of the drop with respect to the ﬂow according to

Eq.(2.4) and Eq.(2.6) both can be used to determine the surface tension s
from observations of
single drops under a microscope. In passing, we note that the classical method based on the result
obtained by Taylor (1934) for the steady–state deformation, can only be used if l
is not too large,
whereas Eq.(2.4) and Eq.(2.6) are more general.

The exact calculations mentioned so far became feasible because (and are applicable if) devi-
ations of the drop from its spherical equilibrium shape are small. On the other hand, if neither
the capillary number (or t 1˙g ) is small nor the viscosity ratio is large, i.e.,

emulsion is known in this regime, where arbitrary drop deformations and break–up may occur.
Below we will also be interested in such cases, where the conditions required for the rigorous
calculations are not fulﬁlled.

where summation over repeated indices is implied, and the ﬁrst two terms vanish for steady shear
ﬂow. Note that since D ei j is diagonal, Eq.(2.9) implies h = h T + O(C 2), and hence Eq.(2.2)
remains valid to ﬁrst order in C as we mentioned already.

Can we extrapolate the exact second order result Eq.(2.9) for the stress tensor to arbitrary C
and l by using the constraints provided by general invariance arguments? For example, since
the shear stress has to change sign if the direction of the shear strain is inverted whereas the
normal stresses do not, the shear stress and the normal stresses have to be odd/even functions of
˙g , respectively. From this observation we could have foreseen that Eq.(2.2) cannot be improved
by calculating the next order in ˙g , i.e., by considering droplet deformation to lowest order. More
important are Galilean invariance and invariance under transformations to rotating coordinate

It sets the time scale for strain relaxation in an unstressed region and was named retardation
time by Oldroyd (1953). Frankel & Acrivos (1970) realized that up to the partly unknown terms

equations of state already discussed by Oldroyd (1958). Hence, setting O(˙g C 2)

for arbitrary C . Obviously, Frankel & Acrivos (1970) have forgotten a term
ﬁxed l
for ﬁxed C . If the latter is included,
−
Eq.(2.13) is also in accord with their O(l −
analysis. Moreover, Eq.(2.13) has the proper lim-
−
iting behavior for l = 1, s
, which is an extreme case of Eq.(2.7). Since we
assume equal densities for the two phases, the two–phase ﬂuid actually reduces to a one–phase
ﬂuid in this degenerate case, and the viscosity is simply h c, independent of morphology. For
illustration, the rigorous limits of Eq.(2.13) in the C
l plane are depicted graphically in Fig. 1.
−
Following Grace (1982), a qualitative break–up curve for single drops under steady shear is also
sketched. In summary, Eq.(2.13) is correct for arbitrary l
,
and for small and large C if l = 1. Therefore, one can expect that Eq.(2.13) works reasonably
well within a large parameter range (small Reynolds number understood). This is further sup-
ported by the observation that the error made in going from Eq.(2.9) to Eq.(2.13) rather concerns
the shape of the droplet than its extension (it consists in truncating a perturbation series in shape
parametrisation). The ﬁnal result, though sensitive to the latter, is probably less sensitive to the
former. Nevertheless, one would not be surprised to see deviations from Eq.(2.13) when drops
become extremely elongated. Finally, due to changes in morphology by break–up and coales-
cence, the avarage drop size R may change. Observe, however, that for most viscosity ratios (l
not close to unity), Eq.(2.13) is practically independent of capillary number (and thus of R) when
break–up might be expected according Grace (1982) and others. As an analytic function that is
physically known to be bounded from above and from below (the latter at least by the viscosity
of a stratiﬁed two–phase ﬂuid depicted in Fig. 3), h (l ,C ) has to have vanishing slope in the

direction for large C . According to Eq.(2.13), h (l ,C ) is almost independent of C for

volume fractions derived below in Eq.(2.18) are practically independent of drop deformation
and morphology. For ﬁnite volume fractions a rough interpolation for C ∗ derived from Eq.(2.18)
is given by 2.4/(5(1 + f ) + 4l ). In a large part of parameter space we thus expect Eqs.(2.13),
(2.18) to be applicable to monotonic shear histories with R given by the average initial radius of
the droplets. For non–monotonic shear histories, there can of course be hysteresis effects in h (˙g )
that result from morphological changes for C
C ∗. These can only be avoided by substituting
for R the radius corresponding to the actual average drop size at the applied shear rate ˙g .

2.3. Finite volume fractions
A general limitation of the equations discussed so far, is the restriction to small volume frac-
tions. Above, we have implicitly assumed that second order effects from drop interactions are
small compared to second order effects from drop deformation. Any direct (coalescence) and
indirect (hydrodynamic) interactions of droplets have been neglected in the derivation. Hydro-
dynamic interactions can approximately be taken into account by various types of cell models.
Recently Palierne (1990) proposed a self–consistent method analogous to the Clausius–Mossotti
or Lorentz–sphere method of electrostatics. For the case of a disordered spatial distribution of
drops his results reduce to those already obtained by Oldroyd (1953). Oldroyd artiﬁcially divides
the volume around a droplet of viscosity h d
c into an interior “free volume” with a viscosity
h c of the bare continuous phase and an exterior part with the viscosity h of the whole emulsion
(see Fig. 2). According to this scheme, an improved version of Eq.(2.2) should be (Oldroyd 1953)

Reverting the line of reasoning pursued so far, we can conclude that to leading order in C and/or
l −
1 the weak deformation limit of the constitutive equation of emulsions is obtained from the
linear viscoelastic spectra G′(w ), G′′(w ). Further, this identiﬁcation can possibly be extended (at
least approximately) into regions of the C
l plane where the critical capillary number for drop
breakup is somewhat larger than C ∗ of Eq.(2.14). In hindsight, it is not surprising that in the
case of weakly deformed drops the frequency dependent viscosity and the steady shear viscosity
are related. Note that under steady shear, drops undergo oscillatory deformations at a frequencey
2w = ˙g
if observed from a co–rotating frame turning with vorticity at a frequency w = ˙g /2. If we
take Eq.(2.24) seriously beyond the rigorously known limit, we obtain an interesting prediction
for the ﬁrst normal stress difference. In contrast to Eq.(2.23), Eq.(2.24) implies that the ﬁrst

Finally, we remark that based on qualitative theoretical arguments, the similarity relation con-
tained in Eq.(2.22) and Eq.(2.24) has recently been proposed also for polymer melts (Renardy
1997). Usually, in polymer physics a slightly different relation is considered; namely a similarity
between h (˙g ) and
h ∗(w )
, also known as Cox–Merz rule (Cox & Merz 1958). In our case, since

(2.25)

Under the conditions mentioned at the beginning of this section, the usual Cox–Merz rule is
fulﬁlled to ﬁrst order in f
for an emulsion. Eqs.(2.22), (2.24) are interesting from the theoretical
point of view, because they suggest a similarity of two a priory rather different quantities. The
results of this section also can be of practical use, since they suggest that two different methods
may be applied to measure a quantity of interest.

2.5. Non–Newtonian constituents

Generalization of the above theoretical discussion to the case of non–Newtonian constituents is
not straightforward. Indeed, as Oldroyd (1953) already knew, his linear–response results quoted
in Eq.(2.20) and Eq.(2.21) are readily generalized to viscoelastic constituents by replacing the

viscosities h d,c in the expression for h ∗ (or G∗) by complex viscosities h ∗d,c(w ) (Palierne 1990).
As a consequence, the decompositions of h ∗ and G∗ in real and imaginary parts are no longer
those of Eqs.(2.20) and (2.21), and h
′′, G′, G′′ are given by more cumbersome expressions.
For the steady–state viscosity, on the other hand, one has to deal with a non–homogeneous vis-
cosity even within homogeneous regions of the emulsion, since the strain rate itself is non–
homogeneous and the viscosities are strain rate dependent. We do not attempt to solve this prob-
lem here, nor do we try to account for elasticity in the nonlinear case. Yet, it is an intriguing
question, whether the similarity rule Eq.(2.22) can be generalized to the case of non-Newtonian
constituents if the constituents themselves obey the Cox–Merz rule (what many polymer melts
and solutions do). If both constituents have similar phase angles q

that enters the expressions for h ∗ and G∗, transforms approximately to h d(˙g )/h c(˙g ) by applying
the Cox–Merz rule. Therefore, in this particular example, Eq.(2.18) supports the expectation
that the generalization may work at least approximately. If, on the other hand, the phase angles
of the constituents behave very differently, the answer is less obvious. This problem has been
investigated experimentally and is further discussed in Section 3.

In any case, the generalization can only work if the representation of the emulsion by a simple
shear–rate dependent viscosity ratio h d(˙g )/h c(˙g ), with ˙g
the external shear rate, is justiﬁed. In
the remainder of this section we construct an argument that allows us to estimate the effective
shear–rate dependent viscosity ratio that should replace l
in Eq.(2.18). We take into account
the deviation of the strain rate from the externally imposed ﬂow only within the drops, because
outside the drops the discrepancy is always small. Inside a drop, the strain rate can be small even
for high external shear rates if the viscosity ratio l = h d/h c is large. Since we are looking for
an effective viscosity ¯h d(˙g ) for the whole drop to replace the viscosity h d at small shear rate,
we replace the non–Newtonian drop of non–homogeneous viscosity by an effective pseudo–
Newtonian drop of homogeneous but shear–rate dependent viscosity. A possible ansatz for ¯h d is
obtained by requiring that the total energy dissipated within the drop remains constant upon this
substitution. Hence, we have

where gi j and ¯gi j denote the rate–of–strain ﬁelds in the real drop and in the corresponding model
drop of effective viscosity ¯h d, respectively. They both depend on the position within the drop,
whereas the average strain rate

that enters the right–hand side of Eq.(2.27) does not. Since the strain ﬁeld ¯gi j within a drop
of homogeneous viscosity is unique for a given system in a given ﬂow ﬁeld, ¯h d itself can be
expressed as a function ¯h d(˙g eff) of the average strain rate. Here, we approximate this functional
dependence by the strain rate dependence h d(˙g ) of the viscosity of the dispersed ﬂuid. Further,
neglecting drop deformation we calculate ˙g eff from the velocity ﬁeld within a spherical drop
(Bartok & Mason 1958) and obtain

A different prefactor (√7 in place of √2) in the expression for the effective strain rate ˙g eff was
obtained by de Bruijn (1989) using instead of the average in Eq.(2.28) the maximum norm of
¯gi j. To obtain the correction to Eq.(2.18) due to Eq.(2.29) in the case of non–Newtonian con-
stituents, the implicit equation for ¯l has to be solved for given functions h c(˙g ) and h d(˙g ). For
shear thinning constituents, Eq.(2.29) implies a tendency of Eq.(2.18) to overestimate h (˙g ) if ˙g
and l are large. In the actual case of interest, for the constituents that were used in the exper-
iments discussed in Section 3, the viscosity ratio l
(h d and h c taken at the external shear rate
˙g ) varies almost by a factor of 10. However, the corrections discussed in this Section only be-
come important for high shear rates, where the constituents are shear thinning. In this regime,
the viscosity ratio (viscosities taken at the external shear rate) only varies between 1/2 and 2,
and hence the corrections expected from Eq.(2.29) are at best marginally signiﬁcant at the level
of accuracy of both Eq.(2.29) and the present measurements. Therefore, a representation of the
drops by pseudo–Newtonian drops of homogeneous but shear–rate dependent viscosity is most
probably not a problem for the measurements presented in the following section. The question
as to a generalization of the similarity rule Eq.(2.22) to non–Newtonian constituents seems well
deﬁned.

3. Experiment

3.1. Materials and methods

The experimental investigation deals with a phase separated aqueous solution containing a polysac-
charide (alginate) and a protein (caseinate). This type of solutions are currently used in the
food industry. The methods for characterizing the individual polymers in solution are in general
known, especially when dealing with non–gelling solutions where composition and temperature
are the only relevant parameters. The polymers are water soluble. When the two biopolymers
in solution are mixed, a miscibility region appears in the low concentrations range and phase
separation at higher concentrations. The binodal and the tie lines of the phase diagram can then
be established by measuring the composition of each phase at a ﬁxed temperature. In general,
the rheological behavior of phase separated systems is difﬁcult to investigate, and a suitable pro-
cedure is not fully established. In some cases, two–phase solutions macroscopically separate by
gravity within a short period of time, but in some other cases (such as ours) they remain stable
for hours or days without appearance of any visible interface. These “emulsion type” solutions
have no added surfactant. Following approaches developed for immiscible blends, one may try
to characterize the partially separated solution as an effective emulsion if the coarsening is slow

enough. In order to establish a comparison between phase separated solutions and emulsions, it
is necessary to know

the volume fraction of the phases,
their shear–rate dependent viscosities (ﬂow curves),
their viscoelastic spectra,
the interfacial tension s between the phases,

A difﬁculty when working with phase separated solutions, as opposed to immiscible polymer
melts, arises from the fact that each phase is itself a mixture (and not a pure liquid) and there-
fore the rheology of the phase depends on its particular composition. If one wishes to minimize
the number of parameters, it is important to keep the composition of the phases constant upon
changing the volume fractions. This can be achieved by working along a tie line of the phase di-
agram. And this is precisely the procedure that we followed. The polymers were ﬁrst dissolved,
then a large quantity of the ternary mixture was prepared (350 ml) and was centrifuged. The two
phases were then collected separately. Both pure phases were found to be viscoelastic and to
exhibit shear thinning behavior, which is especially pronounced for the alginate rich phase with
h (10−
20, while the caseinate rich phase is almost Newtonian below 102
1. The viscosity of the alginate rich phase is higher than that of the caseinate rich phase for
s−
1 and lower for higher shear rates. We checked that both phases obey
shear rates below 2
the usual Cox–Merz rule in the whole range of applied shear rates.

By mixing various amounts of each phase, the volume fraction of the dispersed phase was
varied between 10 % and 30 % while the composition of each phase was kept constant. In partic-
ular, the temperature was kept constant and equal to the centrifugation temperature in order to
avoid redissolution of the constituents. To prepare the emulsion, the required quantities of each
phase were mixed in a vial and gently shaken. Then the mixture was poured on the plate of the
rheometer (AR 1000 from TA Instruments ﬁtted with a cone and plate geometry 6 cm/2◦) and
a constant shear rate was applied. The apparent viscosity for a particular shear rate was then
recorded versus time until it reached a stable value. By shearing at a ﬁxed shear rate, one may
expect to create a steady size distribution of droplets, with a shear rate dependent average size.
After each shear experiment a complete dynamic spectrum was performed. In this way, shear
1 were applied. The analysis of each spectrum ac-
rates ranging between 3
cording to Palierne (1990) allowed us to derive by curve ﬁtting the average drop radius R at the
corresponding shear rate.

3.2. Results and discussion
In this section we present our experimental observations and address the questions posed at
the end of the introduction. Before we present our own data we want to comment brieﬂy on
related data recently obtained for polymer melts by Grizzuti & Buonocore (1998). These authors
measured the shear–rate dependent viscosity of binary polymer melts and compared them to the
low volume fraction limit of Eq.(2.18), i.e. Eq.(2.13), and to (a truncated form of) results of
Choi & Schowalter (1975). They reported much better agreement with Eq.(2.13) than with the
truncated series from Choi & Schowalter (1975). Comparison with the full expressions of Choi
& Schowalter (1975) would have made the disagreement even worse (cf. Fig 3). The average
radius R that enters the equation, was determined independently for each shear rate applied.

in the interesting parameter range, where Eqs.(2.18) and Eq.(2.13) for h (˙g ) are expected to be
sensitive to drop deformation and break–up. Surprisingly, the results show that they describe the
data very well over the whole range of shear rates although one would not necessarily expect
average drop deformation to be very small. Unfortunately, drop sizes have not been reported by
the authors, so conclusions concerning the location in the C
l parameter plane and the validity
of the similarity rule Eq.(2.22) cannot be drawn. Also the question, whether Eq.(2.18) holds for
small viscosity ratios l

Our own measurements were located in about the same l

5 N/m. Using this, we obtained an average drop size R

range. As we noted in the preceding
section, only the ratio R/s enters rheological equations and knowledge of either R or s allows the
other quantity to be inferred from rheological measurements. Ding & Pacek (1999) determined
the interfacial tension of the alginate/caseinate system used in our experiments by observing
drop relaxation under a microscope and analyzing the data according to Section 2. They found
5 m from the measured
spectra G′(w ), G′′(w ) according to Palierne (1990) for the experiments reported in Fig. 5. By
the method based on Palierne (1990), we could not detect a decrease in drop size with shear
rate as expected from the phenomenological phase diagram for single Newtonian drops under
shear as established by Grace (1982) and others. Thus, the limit of high capillary numbers and
moderate viscosity ratios (the region above the break–up curve) in Fig. 1 has been accessed
experimentally. Corresponding locations have been indicated qualitatively in the ﬁgure by dashed
lines. With the drop size being constant, one can try to test the proposed similarity rule Eq.(2.22).

in the ﬁgure for each of these individual measurements. The multiple data sets for h
′ (lines)
taken each between two successive steady shear measurements, superimpose fairly well; i.e.
the spectra appear to be remarkably independent of the preceding steady shear rate. The good
′(w ) and h (˙g ) in Fig. 5 show that the data obey the proposed similarity rule
coincidence of h
Eq.(2.22) over a large range of shear rates. The agreement near ˙g
1 is a consequence
of the proximity to the trivial limit l = 1, C = ¥
. Nevertheless, the data provide strong evidence
that Eq.(2.22) is an excellent approximation for a large range of viscosity ratios and capillary
numbers. Similar results (not shown) have been obtained for other volume fractions. Comparison
with Eq.(2.18) represented by the open triangles in Fig. 5, on the other hand, is less successful at
large shear rates, although it is still not too far off for a theoretical curve without any adjustable
parameter. A discrepancy had to be expected as a consequence of the non–Newtonian character
of the constituents at large shear rates, which is deﬁnitely not taken into account in Eq.(2.18). For
the plot of Eq.(2.18) in Fig. 5 we merely substituted h d(˙g )/h c(˙g ) taken at the external shear rate
˙g
. The average drop size R was obtained from ﬁtting the viscoelastic moduli. The scatter
in the dynamic viscosity data gives rise to an uncertainty in R, which is reﬂected by the multiple
open triangles at low shear rates. It seems that the similarity rule Eq.(2.22) is more general than
Eq.(2.18), i.e., it still holds for rather viscoelastic constituents (that obey the usual Cox–Merz
rule), where the latter fails. This relation certainly deserves further investigation with different
materials and methods.

In summary, we have succeeded in establishing an analogy ﬁrst between a partially phase–
separated polymer solution and an emulsion, and further between the viscoelastic spectrum of
the system and its nonlinear shear viscosity even in the case of (moderately) non–Newtonian
constituents.

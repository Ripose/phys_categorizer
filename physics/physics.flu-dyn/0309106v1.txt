We address the problem of diﬀerences between longitudinal and transverse velocity increments in
isotropic small scale turbulence. The relationship of these two quantities is analyzed experimentally
by means of stochastic Markovian processes leading to a phenomenological Fokker- Planck equa-
tion from which a generalization of the K´arm´an equation is derived. From these results, a simple
relationship between longitudinal and transverse structure functions is found which explains the
diﬀerence in the scaling properties of these two structure functions.

Substantial details of the complex statistical behaviour
of fully developed turbulent ﬂows are still unknown,
[1, 2, 3, 4]. One important task is to under-
cf.
stand intermittency,
i.e. ﬁnding unexpected frequent

ences of velocity ﬂuctuations in diﬀerent spatial direc-
tions have attracted considerable attention as a main
issue of the problem of small scale turbulence, see for
example [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. For local
isotropic turbulence, the statistics of velocity increments
[v(x + r) − v(x)] e as a function of the length scale r is
of interest. Here, e denotes a unit vector. We denote
with u(r) the longitudinal increments (e is parallel to r)
and with v(r) transverse increments (e is orthogonal to
r) [40].

In a ﬁrst step, this statistics is commonly investigated
by means of its moments hun(r)i or hvn(r)i, the so-called
velocity structure functions. Diﬀerent theories and mod-
els try to explain the shape of the structure functions
[2]. Most of the works examine the scaling of the
cf.
n
structure function, huni ∝ rξ
l , and try to explain in-
termittency, expressed by ξn
l − n/3 the deviation from
Kolmogorov theory of 1941 [14, 15]. For the correspond-
n
ing transverse quantity we write hvni ∝ rξ
t . There is
strong evidence that there are fundamental diﬀerences
in the statistics of the longitudinal increments u(r) and
transverse increments v(r). Whereas there were some
contradictions initially, there is evidence now that the
transverse scaling shows stronger intermittency even for
high Reynolds numbers [9, 16].

A basic equation which relates both quantities is de-
rived by K´arm´an and Howarth [17]. Assuming incom-
pressibilty and isotropy, the so called ﬁrst K´arm´an equa-
tion is obtained:

hu2i = 2hu2i − 2hv2i.

more complicated with higher order, including also pres-
sure terms [13, 18].

In this paper, we focus on a diﬀerent approach to char-
acterize spatial multipoint correlations via multi-scale
statistics. Recently it has been shown that it is pos-
sible to get access to the joint probability distribution
p(u(r1), u(r2), . . . , u(rn)) via a Fokker-Planck equation,
which can be estimated directly from measured data
[19, 20, 21]. For a detailed presentation see [22]. This
method is deﬁnitely more general than the above men-
tioned analysis by structure functions, which characterize
only the simple scale statistics p(u(r)) or p(v(r)). The
Fokker-Planck method has attracted interest and was
applied to diﬀerent problems of the complexity of tur-
bulence like energy dissipation [23, 24, 25], universality
turbulence [26] and others [11, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The
Fokker-Planck equation (here written for vector quanti-
ties) reads as

p(u, r|u0, r0).

(i denotes the spatial component of u, we ﬁx i = 1
for the longitudinal and i = 2 for the transverse incre-
ments.) This representation of a stochastic process is
diﬀerent from the usual one:
instead of the time t, the
independent variable is the scale variable r. The minus
sign appears from the development of the probability dis-
tribution from large to small scales. In this sense, this
Fokker- Planck equation may be considered as an equa-
tion for the dynamics of the cascade, which describes
how the increments evolve from large to small scales un-
der the inﬂuence of deterministic (D(1)) and noisy (D(2))
forces. The whole equation is multiplied without loss
of generality by r to get power laws for the moments
(1). Both coeﬃ-

cients, the so-called drift term D(1)
(u, r) and diﬀusion
term D(2)
ij (u, r), can be estimated directly from the mea-
sured data using its mathematical deﬁnition, see Kol-
mogorov 1931 [32] and [22, 30, 33, 34]. With the notation
∆Ui(r, ∆r) := Ui(r − ∆r) − ui(r) the deﬁnitions read as:

Here we extend the analysis to a two dimensional
Markov process, relating the longitudinal and trans-
verse velocity increments to each other. The resulting
Fokker-Planck equation describes the joint probability
distribution p(u(r1), v(r1); . . . ; u(rn), v(rn)). Knowing
the Fokker-Planck equation, hierarchical equations for
any structure function hf (u, v)i =
f (u, v)p(u, v, r)dudv
can be derived by integrating Eq. (2):

which we take as a generalization of the K´arm´an equa-

Next, we describe the experiment used for the subse-
quent analysis. The data set consists of 1.25 ·108 samples
of the local velocity measured in the wake behind a cylin-
der (cross section: D=20mm) at a Reynolds’ number of
13236 and a Taylor- based Reynolds’ number of 180. The
measurement was done with a X-hotwire placed 60 cylin-
der diameters behind the cylinder. The component u
is measured along the mean ﬂow direction, the compo-
nent v transverse to the mean ﬂow is orthogonal to the
cylinder axis. We use Taylor’s hypothesis of frozen tur-
bulence to convert time lags into spatial displacements.
With the sampling frequency of 25kHz and a mean ve-
locity of 9.1 m/s, the spatial resolution doesn’t resolve
the Kolmogorov length but the Taylor length λ = 4.85
mm. The integral length is L =137 mm.

From these experimental data the drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcients are estimated according to eqs.
(3) as de-
scribed in [34], see also [35]. As an example, the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient D(2)
11 (u, v, r = L/4) is shown in Fig. 1. To use
the results in an analytical way, the drift and diﬀusion
coeﬃcient can be well approximated by the following low
dimensional polynoms, which will be veriﬁed by recon-
structed structure functions as it is shown below:

FIG. 1: Diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2)
11 (u, v, r) for r = L/4 esti-
mated from experimental data. Note that the quadratic con-
tributions are responsible for intermittency. The asymmetry
in u-direction is related to the non-vanishing skewness of the
probability distribution of longitudinal velocity increments.

In order to show that the Fokker-Planck equation with
these drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients can well characterize
the increment’s statistics, one has to verify that the evo-
lution process of u(r) and v(r) is a Markov process and
that white and Gaussian distributed noise is involved.
The Markov property can be tested directly via its def-
inition by using conditional probability densities [22] or
by looking at the correlation of the noise of the Langevin
equation [21]. For our case we have veriﬁed that the one-
dimensional processes of the longitudinal and transverse
increments are Markovian [41], thus the two- dimensional
processes should be Markovian, too [33]. As an alterna-
tive approach to verify the validity of the Fokker-Planck
equation we have solved numerically the hierarchical eq.
(4) for humi using the above mentioned coeﬃcients. To
close the equation, we have used the moment hum−2v2i
from the experimental data.
In Fig. 2 the integrated
longitudinal structure functions are given in comparison
with the structure functions directly calculated from the
data (with n =2, 4, 6 and m =0). These results we take
as the evidence that the Fokker-Planck equation charac-
terizes the data well and can be used for further inter-
pretations.

For the drift coeﬃcient, which is the deterministic part
of the cascade dynamics, the process decouples for the
diﬀerent directions. The drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcients
are symmetric with respect to v → −v. Remark, in con-
trast to the statistics of the longitudinal increments, the
transverse one is symmetric and show for example no
skewness hv3i = 0. Furthermore, quadratic terms oc-

The r-dependence of related longitudinal and trans-
verse d-coeﬃcients (du
coincides if the
abscissa are rescaled: dlong(r) ≈ dtransv( 2
3 r), see Fig.
3. The only exception is the coeﬃcient dvv
22 (r), whereas
duu
11 (r) ≈ dvv
22 (r) ≈ const.. We interpret this
phenomenon as a faster cascade for the transverse in-
crements. It can be seen from the hierarchical equation
(4) that this property goes over into structure functions
of arbitrary even order, hvn(r)i ≈ hun( 3
2 r)i. Only the
small coeﬃcients du
22 break this symmetry, be-
cause they belong to diﬀerent odd, and therefore small,
moments.
In Fig. 4, the structure functions of order
2, 4 and 6 are plotted with respect to this rescaled
length r. The structure functions are normalized by

Next, let us suppose that the structure functions scale
n
with a power law, hvn(r)i = cn
l ,
even though our measured structure functions are still
far away from showing an ideal scaling behavior [26].
With exemption of the diﬀerences between duu
11 (r) and
dvv
22 (r), we can relate the structure functions according
to the above mentioned rescaling: hvn(r)i = hun( 3

At last we discuss the use of ESS (extended self-
similarity [37] ) with respect to transverse velocity com-
ponents. In [8, 38, 39] the authors plot hvni against h|u3|i
and obtain that the transverse exponents is smaller than
the longitudinal one, ξn
l . In Fig. 5 the fourth struc-
ture functions are plotted against h|u3|i, which shows
clearly that ξ4
t < ξ4
l . If the transverse structure function
is plotted as a function of h|u3( 3
2 r)|i, this discrepancy
vanishes. Notice that these properties are due to a none
existing scaling behavior. It is evident that our rescal-
ing does not change the exponents in case of pure scaling
behavior.

To conclude the paper, we have presented experimental
evidence that the statistics of longitudinal and transverse
increments is dominated by a diﬀerence in the ”speed of
cascade” expressed by its r dependence. Rescaling the
r dependence of the transverse increments by a factor 2
3
fades the main diﬀerences away. Thus the longitudinal
and transverse structure functions up to order 6 coincide
well. A closer look at the coeﬃcients of the stochastic
process estimated from our data shows that the multi-
plicative noise term for the transverse increments dvv
22 and
the symmetry breaking terms du
22 do not follow
this rescaling. These coeﬃcients may be a source of dif-

here this eﬀect is still very small.

Finally, we could show that our ﬁndings on the rescal-
ing are consistent with the K´arm´an equation and that
longitudinal and transverse Kolmogorov constants of the
structure functions up to order four can be related con-
sistently with our results.

FIG. 5: The fourth order longitudinal (x) and transverse (+)
structure function is plotted against h|u|3i, the third moment
of the longitudinal increments’ modulus (ESS plot).
If the
abscissa of the transverse structure function is rescaled by a
factor of 2/3, both curves fall one upon the other (squares).
The diﬀerences between the exponents also vanish.

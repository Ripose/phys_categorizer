A new type of steady steep two-dimensional irrotational symmetric periodic gravity waves on
inviscid incompressible ﬂuid of inﬁnite depth is revealed. We demonstrate that these waves have
sharper crests in comparison with the Stokes waves of the same wavelength and steepness. The
speed of a ﬂuid particle at the crest of new waves is greater than their phase speed.

A proper understanding of various wave phenomena on
the ocean surface, such as modulation eﬀects and insta-
bilities of large amplitude wave trains [1], [2], formation
of solitary [3], freak [4], and breaking waves [5, 6], re-
quires knowledge of a form and dynamics of steep water
waves. For the ﬁrst time surface waves of ﬁnite ampli-
tude were considered by Stokes [7]. Stokes conjectured
that such waves must have a maximal amplitude (the
limiting wave) and suggested that a free surface of the
limiting wave near the crest forms a sharp corner with
the 120◦ internal angle (the Stokes corner ﬂow). A strict
mathematical proof of the existence of small amplitude
Stokes waves was given by Nekrasov. Toland [8] proved
that Nekrasov’s equation has a limiting solution describ-
ing a progressive periodic wave train which is such that
the ﬂow speed at the crest equals to the train phase speed,
in a reference frame where ﬂuid is motionless at inﬁnite
depth. Longuet-Higgins and Fox [9] constructed asymp-
totic expansions for waves close to the 120◦-cusped wave
(almost highest waves) and showed that the wave proﬁle
oscillates inﬁnitely as the limiting wave is approached.
Later, in [10], the crest of a steep, irrotational gravity
wave was theoretically shown to be unstable.

The purpose of the present work is to give evidence
irrotational
that a second branch of two-dimensional
symmetric periodic gravity waves of permanent form ex-
ists besides the Stokes waves of the same wavelength.
The original motivation is as follows: the Bernoulli equa-
tion is quadratic in velocity and admits two values of the
particle speed at the crest. The ﬁrst one corresponds
to the Stokes branch of symmetric waves for which the
particle speed at the crest is smaller than the wave phase
speed. The opposite inequality takes place for the second
branch which might correspond to a new type of waves.
In the second part of the Letter, we prove this numeri-
cally by using two diﬀerent methods.

Consider a symmetric two-dimensional periodic train
of waves which propagates without changing a form from
left to right along the x-axis with the constant speed c
relative to the motionless ﬂuid at inﬁnite depth. The set
of equations governing steady potential gravity waves on

∗Electronic address: lukom@iop.kiev.ua

a surface of irrotational, inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid is

Φxx + Φyy = 0, −∞ < y < η(θ);

(c − Φx)2 + Φ2

y + 2η = c2,
(c − Φx) ηx + Φy = 0,
Φx = 0, Φy = 0, y = −∞;

y = η(θ);
y = η(θ);
θ = x − ct.

where Φ(θ, y) is the velocity potential, η(θ) is the eleva-
tion of a free surface, and y is the upward vertical axis
such that y = 0 is the still water level. We have chosen
the units of time and length such that the acceleration
due to gravity and wavenumber are equal to unity.

As it follows from the Bernoulli equation (2), a solution
may be not single-valued in the vicinity of the limiting
point.
Indeed, the particle speed at the crest q(0) is
horizontal and is deﬁned as follows:

Φx (0, η(0)) = q(0) = c ±

c2 − 2η(0),

(5)

p

η(0) being the height of the crest above the still water
level. The “−” sign corresponds to the classical Stokes
branch. The value ηmax(0) = c2/2 corresponds to the
Stokes wave of limiting amplitude. In this case, the par-
ticle speed at the crest is exactly equal to the wave phase
speed: qmax(0) = c. Taking into account both signs
in expression (5), we assume that a second branch of
solutions should exist apart from the Stokes waves, at
η(0) < ηmax(0). The particle speed at the crest of a new
gravity wave must be greater than c and has to increase
from c to 2c while the wave height decreases from ηmax(0)
to 0. Moreover, the mean levels of these two ﬂows relative
to the level y = 0 of still water must also be diﬀerent:

η(i)(x)dx = η(i)

i = 1, 2.

(6)

Thus, the existence of a second branch of solutions of the
set of equations (1)-(4) does not contradict Garabedian’s
theorem [11] that gravity waves are unique if all crests
and all troughs are of the same height because the latter
was proved for a ﬂow with the same mean level.

To construct a numerical algorithm we use the method
of the truncated Fourier series and the collocation
method, in a plane of independent spatial variables.

troduce the complex function R(θ, y) such that

They were being calculated using the fast Fourier trans-
form (FFT). In addition to these equations, the connec-
tion (11) between the harmonics ηn and the wave steep-
ness A should be taken into account.

The set of equations (12), (13) was being solved
by Newton’s iterations in arbitrary precision computer
arithmetic. Since the non-linearity over ξn and ηn is of
a diﬀerent character (polynomial and exponential), the
value of M should be chosen greater than N to achieve
good convergence. A diﬀerent number of modes for the
truncation of the Fourier series (9), (10) was also used by
Zuﬁria [12] in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism.

The method of collocations. The harmonics ξn of ex-
pansion (9) can also be found in another way without
expanding elevation into the Fourier series. In this ap-
proach, Eq. (2) and explicitly integrated Eq. (8) are
to be satisﬁed in a number of collocation points θj =
jπ/N, j = 0, N , equally spaced over the half of one
wavelength from the wave crest to the trough, similar to
Rienecker and Fenton [13]. This leads to 2N + 2 alge-
braic equations for the harmonics ξn, the values of the
elevation η at the collocation points, and the wave speed
c. To make the numerical scheme better convergent, the
greater number of collocation points may be used in the
dynamical boundary condition (2): M = P N , P is an
integer.

The results of calculations and discussion. The de-
pendence c(A) of the speed of steep gravity waves on
their steepness is shown in Fig. 1. Along with the curves
obtained by the Fourier and collocation methods, we in-
cluded high accuracy calculations of the Stokes branch
by the method of an inverse plane according to the equa-
tions presented in Tanaka’s paper [14].
In the plot,
point 1 (A = 0.13875) is the maximum of wave speed,
point 2 (A = 0.14092) is the relative minimum, point
3 (A = Amax = 0.141074) corresponds to the limiting
steepness at N and M given. For greater values of N
and M , Amax & 0.14108 is obtained. Note, that less
accurate calculations by the collocation method give a
greater value of the limiting steepness which is close to
that reported by Schwartz [15].

The key result of our numerical investigation is that we
have revealed a new branch which arises from the point
of the limiting steepness in the direction of its decreas-
ing so that the loop 2-3-4 is formed. Thus, the point
of the limiting steepness seems to be the point of maxi-
mum of A, not the breaking point. It should be noted,
that ﬁrstly we obtained the new branch by the Fourier
method, and only after that we could track it by the col-
location method using the starting points generated by
the ﬁrst method. As it is shown in Fig. 2, the proﬁle of
the new solution near the crest is sharper than the proﬁle
of the Stokes wave of the same steepness. Because of this
we named it “the spike wave”. The diﬀerence between
the crests of the Stokes and spike waves becomes stronger
as wave steepness drops relative to the limiting value. In
Fig. 2 the dashed lines designate the exact local Stokes
solution (the Stokes corner ﬂow) which corresponds to
the limiting wave with a maximal value of A (point 3 in
Fig. 1). In the immediate vicinity of the crest, the proﬁles
of the almost highest Stokes and spike waves asymptoti-
cally tend to the dashed lines. This tendency is seen to
have the oscillatory character for both waves. For the
Stokes waves such oscillations were analytically obtained
earlier in [9].

The values of the wave speed c for the Stokes and spike
waves calculated by the Fourier method at diﬀerent val-
ues of wave steepness are presented in Table I. The
high accuracy values of the wave speed for the Stokes
branch obtained by using Tanaka’s procedure are also in-

cluded for comparison. One can see, that for the Stokes
branch the accuracy of the Fourier method gradually de-
creases as wave steepness increases up to the almost high-
est steepness A = 0.14108. The correspondent value of
the wave speed has only 5 digits stabilized. Note, that

Tanaka’s procedure diverges at A & 0.141062. While
moving along the new branch the accuracy becomes still
less, and much greater N are needed to stabilize a greater
number of digits. As a result, the form of the loop in

At the beginning of the paper we assumed the existence
of a new type of gravity waves for which the speed of a
particle at the crest is greater than wave speed. This
property is conﬁrmed by the calculations presented in
Table II.

Thus, the spike waves, which we found numerically
using two independent methods, present a new type of
gravity waves we looked for.
In the present work, we
interested only in the existence of new stationary solu-
tions and did not investigate their stability. Proﬁles of
the almost highest Stokes and spike waves diﬀer only in
the vicinity of the crest. This leads us to an assumption
that excitation of spike waves may possibly be connected
with the crest instabilities [10] of the Stokes almost high-
est waves. From the other side, sharpening of the crest of
a spike wave, when wave steepness decreases (see Fig. 2),
makes us look for a relation to a problem of existence
of solitary waves on deep water. At present, all existent
experimental observations of surface solitary waves on
deep water are usually interpreted by excitation of inter-
nal waves in stratiﬁed ocean [16]. However, veriﬁcation
of our assumption demands another numerical algorithm
since the ones presented above become ineﬀective. Fi-
nally, two-valued character of a solution of Eq. (1)-(4) in
the vicinity of the limiting steepness does not depend on
depth, as follows from Eq. (5). We have recently revealed
a second branch for a layer of ﬁnite depth.

Stokes branch being moved to the left.

Table I also demonstrates that besides the form near
the crest, the Stokes and spike waves of the same steep-
ness have diﬀerent mean water levels η0 relative to the
still water level [see Eq. (6)]. One can see, that at

We study the dynamics of surface waves on a semi-toroidal ring of water that is excited by vertical
vibration. We create this speciﬁc ﬂuid volume by patterning a glass plate with a hydrophobic coating,
which conﬁnes the ﬂuid to a precise geometric region. To excite the system, the supporting plate
is vibrated up and down, thus accelerating and decelerating the ﬂuid ring along its toroidal axis.
When the driving acceleration is suﬃciently high, the surface develops a standing wave, and at yet
larger accelerations, a travelling wave emerges. These diﬀerent surface waves also depend on driving
frequency.

PACS numbers: 47.54.-r, 47.20.Ma, 47.35.-i

In 1831, Faraday ﬁrst observed that surface waves on
a vibrated ﬂuid volume oscillate at half the driving fre-
quency [1]. These Faraday waves demonstrate the surface
instability caused by strong oscillatory accelerations ex-
erted on the ﬂuid volume. Benjamin & Ursell showed
that the amplitude of a surface eigenmode obeys the
It follows that the superpo-
Mathieu equation [2, 3].
sition of multiples of harmonics and subharmonics are
also solutions to the Mathieu equation. In the presence
of ﬁnite viscosity, however, the subharmonic response is
dominant [4, 5, 6].

Recent experiments have revealed that patterns of var-
ious symmetries, such as striped [7, 8], triangular [9],
square [10, 11, 12], and hexagonal [13, 14], can be ex-
cited on the free surface of a ﬂuid layer. Quasi-one di-
mensional surface waves have also been studied in both
narrow annular and channel geometries [15, 16, 17, 18].
In these experiments, the standing waves often interact
with the meniscus that forms at the bounding walls. The
contact point and length-scale of this meniscus continu-
ally change as a result of the vertical oscillations. Con-
sequently, the meniscus emits waves towards the bulk
[16]. In other experiments, to remove this meniscus ef-
fect, the contact point is pinned on a sharp edge or brim
[19, 20, 21].

A curved ﬂuid surface, such as on a hemi-spherical drop
[22, 23, 24], has been used to study surface waves in a
conﬁned geometry without bounding walls. Vibrating
the drop causes waves to form on the curved surface,
and for high external forcing, droplets are ejected. This
process, termed atomization, provides one way to create a
spray [25, 26]. The instability of the drop’s semi-spherical
surface has been utilized for spray cooling, mixing, and
humidiﬁcation.

Other curved geometries have been less studied, per-
haps due to diﬃculties in creating more complex bound-
ing geometries for a droplet. Here, we employ a hy-
drophobic/hydrophilic patterning of a surface to con-
ﬁne a water volume to a speciﬁc region. In particular,

if part of a hydrophilic substrate (low surface energy)
is covered by a hydrophobic coating (high surface en-
ergy; we use Fluorothane ME; Cytonix Corp.), water is
prevented from spreading beyond the hydrophilic region.
The boundary between the two regions acts as an edge
upon which the ﬂuid contact point is pinned.

In the experiment we report here, the hydrophilic re-
gion is a thin annulus, and water placed there forms into
a semi-toroidal volume with two pinned contact lines.
We ﬁnd that surface waves ﬁrst develop along the cen-
terline of the torus, which allows us to study quasi-one
dimensional waves on a curved surface.

The schematic of our experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 1. The annular hydrophilic region has inner radius
a1 = 2.5 cm and outer radius a2 = 3.5 cm. The patterned
glass plate is rigidly connected to a speaker, which oscil-
lates the plate vertically at a controlled driving frequency
and amplitude. A high-speed video camera is centered
above the plate along the axis of the annulus. Since the
semi-torus of water has a cross-sectional radius (r ≈ 0.5
cm) that is relatively small in comparison to the distance
between the plate and the camera, bright regions of the
water ring seen in top-viewed video frames correspond to
local extrema of the ﬂuid surface height.

We use a systematic procedure to deﬁne the onset of
surface waves. At ﬁxed driving frequencies Ω/2π be-
tween 20 Hz and 65 Hz, the amplitude of oscillation is
slowly increased until the ﬂuid surface loses stability to
azimuthally modulated standing waves. For each driv-
ing frequency, a distinct wave pattern is observed. Fig-
ures 2a and b show these standing waves for two diﬀerent
driving frequencies. At 22 Hz (a), the wave pattern has
12 nodes (that is, 12 crossings of the wave peak along
the annular mid-line). The left half of Fig. 2(a) shows a
snapshot of the surface wave, whereas the right half is
the image of two superimposed surface waves in diﬀerent
phases. In the snapshot, the cross-sectional shapes, or
onset modes, of the ﬂuid surface are shown as insets when
cutting across the I and II lines. The overlapped image

demonstrates that standing waves are formed at half the
driving frequency (22 Hz) near the onset. Increasing the
driving frequency to 36 Hz increases the number of wave
nodes to 24 (see Fig. 2b). Near the onset, as the driv-
ing frequency increases, the number of nodes increases
monotonically (and discretely, due to the geometry), as
is shown in Fig. 3.

To describe the instability of the azimuthally modu-
lated surface waves seen in Fig. 2, we use an approximate
inviscid model by considering coupled modes of surface
waves. Rather than using the exact semi-toroidal geome-
try for our calculations, we neglect the annular curvature
and use a cylindrical geometry instead. The variable r
is the radius of the cross-section in cylindrical coordinate
(see Fig. 1b). A water surface without external vibration
is given by r = r0(θ), where the dependence of r on θ is
due to balancing gravity and surface tension. While the
2σ/ρg) of water is 0.4 cm, which is of
capillary length(
the same order of cylinder radius R = 0.5 cm, we assume
for simplicity that the unperturbed surface proﬁle is close
to a semi-circle with constant radius R. Small ﬂuctua-
tions of the surface can then be expressed as R+ζ, where
ζ is a small radial displacement deviating from R.

values of Eq. (6) up to the order of a/g.

Figure 3 compares the observed patterns with theoret-

good agreement with our experimental results observed
close to the onset.

We also ﬁnd experimentally that the onset of surface
waves is hysteretic. Figure 4 shows the maximal displace-
ment A between standing wave peaks over the course
of an oscillation, as a function of dimensionless driving
acceleration hΩ2/g, where h is the amplitude of plate
oscillation. Crossing a critical amplitude from below

In this paper, we have studied the nature of surface
waves on a semi-toroidal water volume that is being os-
cillated along its axis. The ﬂuid volume is constrained to
a precise geometric area (an annulus) by the patterning of
the supporting surface into hydrophobic and hydrophilic
regions. We ﬁnd a hysteretic onset of azimuthal standing
waves, and describe the observed dispersion relation by
a simple linear model. For large forcing, we observe a
transition, again hysteretic, to travelling waves with an
increased number of nodes.

shows the sharp transition to standing wave. This bi-
furcation is subcritical, and at intermediate accelerations
(0.63 g < hΩ2 < 0.67 g) two stable states are observed.

Figure 5 shows yet another hysteretic transition in the
number of surface nodes, at a higher dimensionless accel-
eration. Bistable surface waves with diﬀerent numbers of
nodes co-exist between 1.48 g and 1.71 g. We ﬁnd that
the surface waves above this transition still oscillate at
half the driving frequency, but now have more nodes and
a ﬁnite drift speed (triangles). The inset images show the
patterns of peaks (bright) and troughs (dark) in space-
time. The arrows indicate the direction of azimuthal drift
and its speed. If the acceleration is further increased to
around 4 g, the travelling surface waves become more spa-
tially localized, and droplets are ejected.

Our masking technique can be used eﬀectively to make
complicated hydrophilic regions, and to investigate the
dynamics of ﬂuid volumes trapped within them. Figure 6
shows three separate ﬂuid volumes bound within domains
(the letter shapes A, M and L) of diﬀerent shapes at both
stable and unstable states. At ﬁxed volume to base-area
ratio of 0.16 cm3/cm2, which gives a ﬁxed height for all
shapes slightly above 0.18 cm, instability occurs at diﬀer-
ent thresholds for the diﬀerent base shapes. The shape
that with high aspect ratio (e.g.
letter “L”) appears to
have the highest threshold to instability. The top im-
age shows these volumes at rest, where the transparent
glass surface of the hydrophilic region reveals a square
grid beneath. The bottom image shows the surface wave
dynamics of these ﬂuid volumes as revealed, at least in
part, by the distortions of the underlying grid lines.

The mixing eﬃciency of a ﬂow advecting a passive scalar sustained by steady sources and

sinks is naturally deﬁned in terms of the suppression of bulk scalar variance in the presence of

stirring, relative to the variance in the absence of stirring. These variances can be weighted at

various spatial scales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and eﬃciencies. We

derive a priori estimates on these eﬃciencies from the advection–diﬀusion partial diﬀerential

equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically homogeneous and isotropic incompressible

ﬂows. The analysis produces bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies in terms of the P´eclet number,

a measure the strength of the stirring relative to molecular diﬀusion. We show by example

that the estimates are sharp for particular source, sink and ﬂow combinations. In general the

high-P´eclet number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as well as prefactors) depends

on the structure and smoothness properties of, and length scales in, the scalar source and

sink distribution. The fundamental model of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink

combination by the random sine ﬂow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation

and analysis. The large-scale mixing eﬃciency follows the upper bound scaling (within

a logarithm) at high P´eclet number but the intermediate and small-scale eﬃciencies are

qualitatively less than optimal. The P´eclet number scaling exponents of the eﬃciencies

observed in the simulations are deduced theoretically from the asymptotic solution of an

internal layer problem arising in a quasi-static model.

INTRODUCTION

Mixing processes in ﬂuids play a key role in a wide variety of engineering applications and for

natural systems such as the ocean and atmosphere. Their theoretical study has been a major focus

of research, as indicated by the large number of review articles [1–8]. At the smallest scales mixing

is achieved by molecular diﬀusion processes, but it may be facilitated greatly by stirring. The

result of stirring is usually to enhance the eﬀect of molecular diﬀusion and increase the mixing

rate [9–13]. Quantitative understanding of the fundamental features of stirring and its inﬂuence

on mixing processes is important for the eﬀective modeling, simulation and design or control of

these systems.

The “eﬃciency” of mixing means diﬀerent things in diﬀerent contexts. For example the dis-

persion of an initial distribution by an imposed ﬂow is a transient problem where the temporal

approach to the ﬁnal fully mixed state, rather than the ﬁnal state itself, is of central interest.

Consider for deﬁniteness the homogeneous advection–diﬀusion equation for a passive scalar ﬁeld

θ(x, t) stirred by a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld u(x, t),

where κ is the molecular diﬀusivity. If this equation is supplied with initial concentration θ(x, 0)

and applied in an appropriate domain without sources, sinks or scalar ﬂux at the boundaries, then

the integral of θ is conserved, so without loss of generality it may be taken to vanish from the start.

But the L2-norm

indicating an inexorable decay of the variance. Eﬃcient mixing in this transient decay problem

means faster decay of the scalar variance. The mixing eﬃciency of a particular ﬂow could be deﬁned,

for example, in terms of its ability to reduce the variance from the initial value to a prescribed

value within a speciﬁc period of time [14]. Because the right-hand side of (I.2) is proportional to

κ, it is evident that molecular processes are ultimately responsible for mixing by this criterion.

Even though the stirring ﬁeld does not appear explicitly in (I.2), the conventional intuition is that

material line stretching in the ﬂow can amplify scalar gradients thereby enhancing the molecular

mixing rate. Indeed, the velocity’s rate-of-strain matrix serves as the local growth rate of the scalar

gradient ﬁeld. These issues are of extreme interest for both theory and applications, but in this

paper we are interested in a distinct scenario where diﬀerent eﬀects are at work.

3

Mixing a scalar ﬁeld whose ﬂuctuations are constantly replenished by steady but spatially in-

homogeneous sources and sinks is a problem with a long history. Early on, Townsend [15, 16]

was concerned with the eﬀect of turbulence and molecular diﬀusion on a line-source of temper-

ature, a heated ﬁlament. The spatial localization of the source, imposed by experimental con-

straints, enhanced the role of molecular diﬀusivity. Saﬀman [17] also found that molecular diﬀusion

and turbulent diﬀusion were not simply additive and that higher-order corrections were needed.

Durbin [18] and Drummond [19] introduced stochastic particle models to turbulence modeling,

and these allowed more detailed studies of the eﬀect of the source on diﬀusion. Sawford and

Hunt [20] pointed out that small sources, such as heated ﬁlaments, lead to an explicit dependence

of the variance on molecular diﬀusivity. Many reﬁnements to these models followed, see for in-

stance [21, 22] and the review by Sawford [5]. Chertkov et al. [23–27] and Balkovsky & Fouxon [28]

treated the case of a random, statistically-steady source. Our goal in the present paper is to

make the source-dependence of the concentration variance more precise by working directly from

the advection–diﬀusion equation, without specifying the underlying turbulent statistics other than

basic stationarity and homogeneity assumptions.

When a source of scalar concentration is present, the transient kinetics are of less immediate

interest and instead the properties of the (statistical) steady state are of greater relevance. As

will be seen, this sustained steady-state dynamics highlights other features of stirring and mixing

processes. In comparing the steady-state problem to the transient problem deﬁned by Eq. (I.2),

it is important to remember that the long-time asymptotic behavior of the decaying problem is

usually irrelevant to the corresponding long-time behavior of the steady-state problem. This is

because the continuous replenishing of concentration overwhelms small-amplitude eﬀects observed

for long-time decay, such as the ‘strange eigenmode’ [29–40].

In this paper we consider the stirring and mixing of a passive scalar sustained by a steady

source-sink function s(x). Given a prescribed divergence-free velocity ﬁeld u(x, t) and a molecular

diﬀusivity κ, the scalar concentration θ(x, t) obeys the inhomogeneous advection–diﬀusion equation

Eﬀective stirring makes the scalar ﬁeld more spatially uniform, lowering the variance, and this is

the basic mixing eﬀect that we set out to study. Many investigations have been concerned with

other statistical properties of the scalar ﬁeld for this kind of model, such as details of the tails of

the probability distribution of θ [2, 6]. While these studies present fascinating mathematical and

physical issues, in terms of applications they are most likely to be of ultimate use in designing

closure approximations, i.e., models of the model, in order to accurately estimate bulk measures

of mixing like variance reduction. In this work we focus directly on the supression of the scalar

ﬂuctuations as a primary indicator of mixing.

In terms of the Fourier decomposition of the scalar ﬁeld,

eﬀectiveness of stirring on mixing at relatively small and large scales will be gauged in terms of

these norms. Eﬃcient stirring decreases the variances on all scales, although it can be expected

that any particular stirring may be more eﬀective on some scales than on others.

It is appropriate here to point out a fundamental and elementary distinction between transient

and steady-state stirring. For eﬃcient transient mixing the goal is to decrease the scalar variance

light of this observation we may anticipate that stirring strategies designed to maximize mixing

eﬃciency in the sustained source problem are likely to be diﬀerent from those employed in the

transient decay scenario.

Intensifying the stirring often increases the mixing eﬃciencies and it is important to characterize

this property in terms of the forcefulness of the ﬂow. The simplest bulk measure of the vigor of

using the domain length scale L for simplicity here.

It will become apparent that this domain

length scale may not be the most appropriate one for this purpose; determining the relevant length

scales is one of the central points of this study.

For many applications it is useful to know how ﬂuctuations at various length scales may be

suppressed as functions of κ, U , and other features of the problem such as details of the ﬂow

and source-sink structures. Toward this end it is desirable to know how the multi-scale mixing

eﬃciencies depend on the P´eclet number, and the notion of “eddy diﬀusivity” provides a conceptual

benchmark for this dependence.

A ﬂow with velocity scale U and “persistence length”, “mixing length” or “eddy size” ℓ that

characterizes the typical distance a particle travels before changing direction can disperse particles

diﬀusively on appropriate space and/or time scales. This suggests that when advection dominates

molecular diﬀusion, an eﬀective diﬀusion with coeﬃcient κeﬀ ∼
determine some gross statistical features of the scalar ﬁeld.1 If this is so, then the steady-state

The linear scaling

Pe at high P´eclet numbers, which we will refer to as the “classical”

scaling, provides a baseline reference for the multi-scale mixing eﬃciencies. Flows that generate

this classical scaling asymptotically as Pe

produce a truly eﬀective “residual” molecular-like

diﬀusion as far as the suppresion of variances at the various spatial scales is concerned, even in

the singular κ

0 limit of vanishing molecular diﬀusivity. And as this discussion suggests, if the

eﬃciency scales classically then the prefactor provides a precise prediction of the length scale with

which an eddy diﬀusivity might be meaningfully identiﬁed.

The principal purpose of this paper is to determine limits on the mixing eﬃciencies, i.e., to

derive a priori bounds on

those limits. Upper bounds on

Ep as a function of Pe, and to investigate what sort of ﬂows might realize
Ep(Pe) are of particular interest because they characterize the most
eﬃcient stirring strategies that can possibly be hoped for. If the bounds are to be useful then they

should be realizable or approachable, or at the very least indicative of the kind of behavior that is

possible—such as a scaling like

Peα at high P´eclet numbers.

Ep ∼

Upper bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies follow from lower bounds on the variances and the ﬁrst

study in this direction was apparently by Thiﬀeault, Doering, and Gibbon [42] who focused on

estimates and simulations for

E0. They adapted an approach that had been used to bound turbulent
dissipation in the Navier–Stokes equations [43, 44] for application to inhomogeneous advection–

diﬀusion equations. For the steady source model of interest here they showed that if

That result showed that very generally the classical scaling is an upper limit to the mixing

eﬃciency in this most basic sense. Moreover, the coeﬃcient in the high P´eclet number scaling
E0 . b Pe puts a limit on any reasonable value for a mixing length: ℓ . bL. It is especially notable
that this rigorous estimate of ℓ (really of the prefactor b) is uniform in the stirring ﬁeld u and

independent of any length scales it exhibits. It also is independent of κ. It emerges as a length

scale in the source-sink distribution, which is seen to play a more important role in the mixing

process than the conventional eddy diﬀusion picture anticipates. When the relevant length scale

in the sustaining source and sink is small then the variance suppression by advection is necessarily

limited by this no matter what spectrum of scales is present in the stirring process.

These observations serve as the starting point for this study. Here we carry forward the investi-

gation of stirring and variance suppression by extending the analysis to multi-scale mixing measures

while focusing on a broad but speciﬁc class of statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic

ﬂows. The restriction to this class of ﬂows—a class that includes but is not limited to homoge-

8

neous isotropic high Reynolds number turbulence—allows for the exact solution of some variational

problems for bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies. For certain sources and sinks these bounds yield

anomalous sub-classical exponents for the Pe scaling of some of the

Ep. Thus anomalous scaling is
inevitable for some source-sink distributions. In those cases it cannot be avoided by manipulating

details of the ﬂow or the spectrum of the stirring. We study the case of a monochromatic source

x) in detail. The estimates are particularly simple in this case and they are sharp:

we will exhibit a statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic stirring strategy that saturates

s(x)

sin(ks ·

∼

the upper bounds.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the relevant class of statistically

stationary, homogeneous and isotropic ﬂows in Section II, and present some speciﬁc examples.

We formulate variational problems for bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies in Section III, and derive

general estimates. In Section IV we evaluate the bounds explicitly for some particular sources and

sinks and show that classical scaling estimates may be sharp. In Section V we focus on the high-Pe

behavior of the mixing eﬃciency bounds for a variety of source-sink distributions, and show that

anomalous sub-classical scaling is sometimes unavoidable.

In Section VI we are concerned with the fundamental example of a monochromatic source

stirred by a ﬂow with a single length scale, the so-called random sine ﬂow, a type of renewing

ﬂow. Measuring the mixing eﬃciencies in direct numerical simulations, we ﬁnd that the large-

are relegated to appendices.

II. STATISTICALLY STATIONARY HOMOGENEOUS ISOTROPIC FLOWS

Our approach to estimating mixing eﬃciencies is kinematic: the stirring vector ﬁeld u(x, t)

is assumed to be given.

It could be a solution of the Navier–Stokes equations, or it could be

a stochastic process with convenient or interesting spectral properties, or it could be a regular

time-periodic ﬁeld. The mixing eﬃciency bounds obtained in this paper will apply so long as a

few generic statistical conditions are satisﬁed. Of course not every stirring ﬁeld satisfying these

conditions will saturate the bounds, but they are all limited by them.

This analysis in this paper is concerned with velocity ﬁelds that satisfy the following three

conditions:

•

The ﬁeld is divergence free,

u = 0, everywhere and at all times.

Pe = U L/κ is ﬁnite. We will also presume more regularity for the velocity whenever necessary

to carry out formal calculations. This will be apparent in the course of the applications if

the ultimate estimates depend on other norms of the ﬁeld.

The velocity ﬁeld is statistically stationary, homogeneous and isotropic. For the purposes

of this work these qualities are deﬁned by the one- and two-point equal time statistics

(presuming that these time averages exist pointwise in space)

relevant implications for the calculation of bounds on the various multi-scale mixing eﬃciencies.

We also provide explicit examples, i.e., we describe several ﬂows with these properties that will be

useful for considerations in subsequent sections.

a statistical steady state. Of course the forcing would have to be capable of producing the homoge-

neous and isotropic statistics described above, not an altogether trivial task. This approach would

be taken to study mixing properties of high-Reynolds number turbulent ﬂows.

Other ﬂows may be easier and more convenient to implement in simulations or to utilize in the

analysis of speciﬁc models. Some features of the stirring—for instance a stationary energy spectrum

consistent with developed turbulence—can be realized by specifying the modal amplitudes ˆuk(t)

One model of interest is a ﬂow involving just a single wavenumber k

a.k.a. the renewing wave ﬂow [29, 30, 42, 45]. (The term ‘renewing’ or ‘renovating’ has been used to

refer to ﬂows that are piecewise-constant in time but change randomly at regular intervals [46–48].

Zeldovich [49] introduced a similar single-mode ﬂow, but it was oscillatory rather than renewing

and thus had poor mixing properties.) In this example the velocity vector ﬁeld switches periodically

characteristic persistence τ is another parameter of this ﬂow. Of course an appropriate selection of

the directions for k and U must be made in order to realize statistical homogeneity and isotropy

by the deﬁnition used here.

III. BOUNDS ON THE MIXING EFFICIENCIES

In this section we derive bounds on the multi-scale mixing eﬃciencies

Ep for p = 0, 1,

−

1, corre-

sponding to intermediate, small, and large scales, respectively, for ﬂows that satisfy the statistical

homogeneity and isotropy conditions in (II.5) and (II.6). We ﬁrst brieﬂy address lower bounds,

but focus for the most part on upper estimates. The variational formulation and solution for up-

per bounds on intermediate and large length scales proceeds along similar lines, so we shall treat

the variance in detail and give a more brisk derivations for the large-scale mixing measure. Two

diﬀerent lower estimates on the small-scale variance, corresponding to upper bounds on the mixing

eﬃciency at small scales, are derived. One of these small-scale results depends on the spectral

distribution of energy in the stirring ﬁeld while the other depends only on the total bulk energy.

A. Lower bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies

Lower bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies follow from upper bounds on the corresponding vari-

ances. We already derived a lower bound for the small-scale mixing eﬃciency

E1 in the introduction

by considering the steady-state variance dissipation-production balance in (I.11),

The subsequent result in (I.14), valid for any incompressible ﬂow even without invoking any sta-

tistical assumptions, is precisely the statement that

1.

E1 ≥

We expect that this estimate can be sharp in the sense that there may exist a ﬂow ﬁeld with

arbitrary P´eclet number that may realize it. Certainly this is true in 2d: given the source-sink

function s(x) with unstirred scalar distribution θ0(x), just deﬁne a ﬂow ﬁeld with stream function

ψ(x)

θ0(x). The streamlines of such a ﬂow are along level sets of θ0 so the ﬂow has no eﬀect.

Indeed, for this ﬂow u

θ0 = 0 no matter what the magnitude of U is, so θ0 is the stationary

· ∇

solution of the advection–diﬀusion equation for any value of Pe. However, this perfectly “non-

mixing” ﬂow is not statistically stationary, homogeneous and isotropic, and it is not clear whether

further constraints derived from the full advection–diﬀusion equation might be implemented to

raise this lower estimate for such ﬂuctuating ﬂows. We leave that question for a future study.

We can follow the same line of reasoning to derive lower estimates on the other mixing eﬃcien-

cies, although perhaps with less satisfaction. A lower bound on

E0 requires an upper estimate on

the existence of ﬂows that might increase scalar variance. Note as well that this estimate depends

explicitly on the functional “shape” of the source-sink distribution, a feature that we will ﬁnd for

many estimates—upper and lower—on the mixing eﬃciencies.

The result can in principle be sharpened by solving the variational problem

where the maximization is performed over all ϑ(x) satisfying the (periodic) boundary conditions

E0 that is strictly
less than 1 [50]. Further details are relegated to Appendix A; this analysis does not prove that

there actually is some stirring that can increase the scalar variance for such sources, but it leaves

open the possibility. For the purposes of this study we will settle for this lower bound as far as its

P´eclet number scaling is concerned. That is,

where the positive coeﬃcient c may depend on the source-sink distribution, and we cannot rule

out that it might be less than 1.

A lower bound on the large-scale mixing eﬃciency follows from the constraint (III.1) via

Poincar´e’s and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequalities as well. It follows from (III.3) that

This analysis begins by multiplying the advection–diﬀusion equation (I.3) by a smooth, time-

independent, spatially periodic “projector function” ϕ(x) and taking the space-time average and

integrating by parts to obtain

The multiplier function ϕ(x) plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the “Reynolds

ϑ = κ∆ϑ + s as a constraint. The formulation of the

· ∇
bound as a min-max problem in (III.15) is, as we will see, convenient for its solution.

The minimization over ϑ in (III.15) is equivalent to an application of the Cauchy–Schwarz

We explicitly indicate the time average in the denominator of (III.17) remembering that ϕ is

time-independent. An important point here is that we can average the time-dependent self-adjoint

operator

LL† before carrying out the maximization over ϕ.

Maximizing (III.17) over ϕ is equivalent to minimizing its denominator. Without loss of gen-

erality, since the functional (III.17) is homogeneous in ϕ, we constrain ϕ to have unit projection

onto the source. Thus we must minimize the functional

Specializing to ﬂows satisfying the assumptions of statistical homogeneity and isotropy in (II.1)

We can improve this upper estimate by avoiding the application of the Cauchy–Schwartz in-

This upper bound depends on details of the full spectrum of the stirring velocity ﬁeld.

We will not perform the optimization over ϕ for the general problem here; the implications of

two-point statistical properties of the stirring on the P´eclet number dependence of this bound on

will be left for future investigations. There is one case, however, where the optimization can easily

be carried out that shows that the result of (III.37) may indeed be a quantitative improvement

over (III.29). That simple case is when the spectrum of the velocity ﬁeld is concentrated at k = 0,

i.e., when the velocity ﬁeld is at (almost) every moment of time a uniform “wind” in space. For
such spatially uniform statistically homogeneous and isotropic ﬂows, ˆC(0) = U 2 while all the other

Compare this to (III.24) for the upper estimate on

E0 and (III.29) and (III.37) for the upper
E1. Note that the eﬃciency depends on the enstropy in the ﬂow, i.e., the ﬂow’s
“shear” or “strain” content, directly through λ = U/Ω. Interestingly, the Ω (or λ) term allows

estimate on

P

for an increase in the bound on the mixing eﬃciency on large scales via stirring on small scales,

something that is absent in the bounds on the mixing eﬃciency at intermediate and small scales.

IV. SATURATING THE MULTI-SCALE MIXING EFFICIENCY BOUNDS

Ep derived in the previous section depend on the

the statistically homogeneous and isotropic stirring ﬁeld. In this section we show that there is at

least one combination of sources, sinks and stirring strategies that saturate the upper estimates

exactly at all P´eclet numbers. This establishes that on the highest level of generality the upper

19

bound analysis is absolutely sharp. We also show that there is at least one combination of sources,

sinks and statistically stationary homogeneous isotropic stirrings that saturate the scaling (if not

necessarily the prefactor) of the lower estimates on the eﬃciencies

Consider the simple monochromatic source function

s(x) = √2S sin(ksx1)

(IV.1)

where S is the root mean square amplitude, 2π/ks is the wavelength, and x1 is one of the d

coordinates. For this monochromatic source the lower bounds on the mixing eﬃciencies at all

scales are the same, i.e., for p =

diﬀerent for monochromatic source-sink distribution functions. But if we restrict attention to

“uniform wind” ﬂows u(x, t) that are at each instant of time spatially uniform (i.e.,

u(x, t) = 0),

then Ω = 0, λ

(monochromatic sources & uniform winds).

(IV.3)

In order to show that the upper bounds in (IV.3) are sharp, we construct a family of statistically

homogeneous and isotropic ﬂows that approach these limits. The trick is to sustain a uniform wind

in a given direction for a “long” time so that the steady state is very nearly achieved before

switching to a uniform wind in another direction. The dynamic transients between the changes in

ﬂow conﬁgurations decay at least at rate κk2

s , so when the transitions are suﬃciently infrequent the

scalar ﬁeld is almost always (nearly) in a static conﬁguration. Then we may solve the steady ﬂow

problem for the scalar ﬁeld exactly and average the variances over the wind directions to evaluate

the eﬃciencies in the limit of slow switches among the directions. This adiabatic averaging method

can be implemented for other ﬂows, too, as will be considered in Section VI.

Consider uniform winds of speed U blowing along the “diagonals”, in the 2d directions given

by unit vectors

precisely as in (IV.3).

On one hand this result is fairly intuitive: the most eﬃcient way to reduce the variance (on any

length scale) is to direct the ﬂow from source regions directly toward the closest convenient sink

regions and the likewise from sinks toward sources—if this can be accomplished eﬀectively given

the constraints of incompressibility and statistical homogeneity and isotropy. This can be done

simply for these monochromatic ﬂows on the torus, and we have discovered that such ﬂows actually

suppress the scalar variance at all scales as well as is possible for any statistically homogeneous

and isotropic ﬂow ﬁeld. (Note: this example was inspired by Plasting & Young [51] who showed

that the steady direct ﬂow across the source saturates the variance bound for single-wavenumber

sources among all ﬂows regardless of any statistical considerations.) On the other hand this type of

sweeping ﬂow is somewhat pathological in the sense that it simply transports the source onto the

sink without “stirring” and “mixing” by the usual meanings of those words. In some cases, such as

transient mixing as discussed in the introduction, the role of eﬀective stirring is to stretch material

lines and amplify gradients of the passive scalar to accelerate the action of molecular diﬀusion to

dissipate variance on small scales.

21

It is not presently clear whether the upper bounds in (III.24), (III.37) and (III.38) can be sat-

urated for more general sources and sinks. Moreover, this particular saturation result depends

explicitly on the geometry of the domain. In geophysical and astrophysical applications, for exam-

ple, it is natural to consider the domain to be the surface of a sphere. While such a domain admits

similar concepts of statistical homogeneity and isotropy for the ﬂow and “monochromaticity” for

the source-sink distribution (eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the sphere), there is no analogous

uniform sweeping ﬂow as there is on the torus. This makes it clear that the optimal stirrer is a

function of both the source shape and the domain. Formulating the optimization problem for the

best stirring ﬁeld for a given source-sink distribution remains a problem for future investigation.

We close this section by pointing out that a similar statistically homogeneous and isotropic

uniform wind can also be arranged to saturate the high-Pe scaling of the lower bounds on the

mixing eﬃciencies. For the monchromatic source (IV.1), consider uniform winds oriented along

the coordinate axes in the 2d directions

ˆej, switching only after blowing each way for a long

±

enough time for the transients to be negligible for the time averages. The wind reduces the scalar

variances below the variance in θ0 only when it blows in the

ˆe1 directions, which occurs 1/d of

the time. Averaging the scalar variance adiabatically over the wind directions yields the mixing

eﬃciencies

V. HIGH-Pe BEHAVIOR OF THE MIXING EFFICIENCY BOUNDS

(IV.9)

(IV.10)

Here we examine the high P´eclet number behavior of the upper bounds on the multi-scale mixing

eﬃciencies for statistically homogeneous and isotropic ﬂows. As a point of reference we recall that if

there is an eﬀective eddy diﬀusion associated with the ﬂow ﬁeld, so that the stirring suppresses the

scalar variances in the manner of enhanced molecular diﬀusion in the form of an equivalent (eddy)

∼

U ℓ, then the eﬃciencies would scale “classically”, as

There are three signiﬁcant features of these scaling bounds worth noting.

P

The ﬁrst point is that these upper estimates all scale classically, allowing us to identify the

largest possible values for meaningful mixing lengths that we have labeled ℓ(max)

.

p

The second remarkable fact is that the largest possible mixing lengths relevant to small and

intermediate scale ﬂuctuations do not depend on the ﬂow ﬁeld, but rather only on the source-
sink distribution. Indeed, ℓ(max)

L/2π are particular length scales in the source-sink

function that have nothing to do with the stirring ﬁeld or any length scales in the ﬂow. This is in

direct conﬂict with the notion that a mixing length should be a characteristic persistence length or

eddy size in the velocity vector ﬁeld. Rather, these mixing eﬃciencies are ultimately limited by the
structure of the sources and sinks. When ℓ(max)

ℓ(max)

sort of clever stirring designed to enhance the variance reduction at intermediate and small scales.

23

The bound on the mixing length ℓ

1 for large-scale variance reduction, however, does depend

−

on the spectrum of length scales in the ﬂow through (the Taylor microscale) λ. It is interesting
to note that the bound on ℓ(max)

1, allowing for the possibility that

is an increasing function of λ−

1

−

small-scale stirring could enhance large scale mixing. That is, this analysis does not preclude

small-scale stirring from suppressing large-scale ﬂuctuations in ways that it cannot decrease the

variance at intermediate and small scales.

We note as well that the improved upper bound on the small-scale mixing eﬃciency

E1 in
that depends on the spectrum, i.e.,

(III.37) generally produces an even smaller estimate for ℓ(max)

the magnitude and distribution, of the length scales in the ﬂow. In cases where the shortest length

scale (call it ℓs) in the source is much longer than the longest length scale (call it ℓu) in the stirring
ﬁeld, a thoughtful examination of (III.37) suggests that ℓ(max)

ℓu ≪

∼

ℓs.

The third point worth noting is that the upper estimates for all three of the

Ep scale the same,
. So far all the examples we have considered share this property, but in the next

∼
subsection we will see that this is not a general feature of the multi-scale mixing eﬃciency bounds.

B. Measure-valued source-sink distributions

If s(x) /

L2(Td) then the sum in the denominator of (V.5) diverges and the ratio deﬁning

/L) to the Pe1 scaling could vanish. This would violate the lower bound

1, so the high-Pe asymptotic analysis of the ratios of sums must be revisited. This issue

E1 ≥
arises for measure-valued sources and sinks, i.e., when the distribution involves singular objects

like δ-functions. Then “anomalous” sub-classical P´eclet number scalings for some eﬃciencies are

inevitable.

Consider the extreme cases where the Fourier coeﬃcients of s(x) obey

(V.8)

In this case, in spatial dimensions d = 2 and 3, sums in both (V.5) and (V.6) diverge so the high-

E1 and

E0 must be re-evaluted directly from (V.1) and (V.2). The

Both the numerator and the denominator diverge in the bound in (V.1) for

beyond the suppression achieved by molecular diﬀusion alone—in the presence of small-scale scalar

sources and sinks.

The scalings for the mixing eﬃciencies with a δ-function source are apparently not all realized

by a simple uniform wind as was the case for smooth monochromatic sources. We have performed

the adiabatic approximation for the bulk variance in the case of a uniform wind blowing past a

δ-function source to estimate the mixing eﬃciencies (see Appendix B). While

E1 is necessarily equal

be required to realize them. Those questions remain open, but in this section we settle the issue of

the possibility of realizing distinct scaling exponents for the mixing eﬃciencies on diﬀerent length

scales for a smooth source-sink distribution.

The random sine ﬂow, a.k.a. the renewing wave ﬂow characterized by a single length scale, is a

popular and convenient test bed for studying—both analytically and via simulation—a wide variety

of stirring and mixing phenomena [29, 30, 42, 45]. Here we consider the simplest single-scale source

stirred by a random sine ﬂow that switches between

and

s(x) = √2 S sin[2π(x + y)/L]

u(x) = ˆi√2 U sin[2πy/L + φ]

u(x) = ˆj√2 U sin[2πx/L + φ]

at time intervals of length τ /2, where the phase φ is chosen randomly and uniformly from [0, 2π)

at each switch. This is a statistically homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow, but it is not the maximally

eﬃcient ﬂow for this source-sink distribution; the optimal ﬂow is the spatially uniform ﬂow con-

structed in Section IV. We have performed high resolution direct numerical simulations of this

system in d = 2 spatial dimensions that reveal that the multi-scale mixing eﬃciencies may have

distinct scaling exponents. Additionally, for this example we are able to compute the exponents

theoretically in the context of the adiabatic averaging approximation utilized in Section IV.

These simulations establish two important facts: (1) that the mixing eﬃciencies at diﬀerent

length scales generally scale diﬀerently at high P´eclet numbers, and (2) that anomalous subclassical

scaling can easily be realized by simple and “reasonable” ﬂows.

We can evaluate the observed scaling exponents αp theoretically for this particular system by

appealing to a quasi-static adiabatic approximation introduced in Section IV for the optimally

mixing uniform ﬂow. That is, we solve the time-independent problem for the scalar distribution

under the inﬂuence of steady ﬂows of the form (VI.2) and (VI.3), compute the variances, and

average over the ﬂow conﬁgurations. The physical justiﬁcation for this approximation comes from

examining the results of the direct numerical simulations: it is observed that the relevant steady-

state conﬁguration is quickly approached in the time intervals between the switches of the stirring

ﬁeld. If we make the switches at longer and longer intervals, i.e., if we increase τ , the scalar ﬁeld is

distributed (nearly) according to the static conﬁgurations for most of the time, and the steady-state

variances dominates the time averages.3

The simplest problem in this category is when the velocity ﬁeld is oriented parallel to the

gradient of the source, so we consider the steady advection–diﬀusion equation

√2U sin kuy ∂xθ = κ(∂2

x + ∂2

y )θ + √2S sin ksx

(VI.4)

3 This approach is similar in spirit to “rapid distortion theory” in turbulence [53, 54].

30

where we allow for diﬀerent length scales in the stirring and the source with the non-dimensional

number r = ku/ks gauging the relative amount of shear in the ﬂow. This is not exactly the static

problem corresponding to the dynamic simulations where the ﬂow is always at a 45◦ angle from

the source-sink alignment, but it turns out that the scaling exponents αp are the same for that

case and for the 90◦ alignment in (VI.4). For illustrative purposes it is convenient to explain the

most elementary case (VI.4) in detail here and relegate details of the 45◦ problem to Appendix C.

The solution to (VI.4) takes the form

θ(x) = f (y) sin(ksx) + g(y) cos(ksx)

(VI.5)

where the functions f and g are periodic on y

compatible with (VI.6b) which says that f and g have opposite parity. We can thus infer boundary

conditions on the reduced domain [0, π/ku]:

g(0) = 0 = g(π/ku),

f ′(0) = 0 = f ′(π/ku).

(VI.7)

We are interested in the high-Pe behavior of the solution to (VI.4).

In Figure 3 we show a

grayscale plot of the scalar ﬁeld at several values of the P´eclet number. As is evident, internal

layers develop along the lines of maximum shear around y = nπ/ku for n = 0,

from these lines the ﬂow directly blows source regions onto sink regions and vice versa which, as

we have seen in Section IV, is the most eﬃcient stirring to reduce variance at all scales. Even

though the regions of high shear eﬀectively stretch material lines, the mixing process is apparently

frustrated by the constant replishment of the scalar variation by the steady sources and sinks and

the variance is dominated by ﬂuctuations concentrated in shear layers.

stirring at ever smaller scales does not further enhance the mixing eﬃciency on small scales. This is

apparently because the decrease in gradient variance due to stirring on small scales is compensated

by the increase in gradient variance in the internal layer.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The suppression of bulk variance of a scalar ﬁeld is a natural gauge of the eﬃciency of stirring,

and this notion allows for the examination of the eﬀect of a ﬂow on various length scales. We have

quantiﬁed the inﬂuence of stirring on weighted bulk variances in terms of nondimensional mixing

eﬃciencies

and large (p =

Ep that characterize ﬂuctuations on relatively small (p = 1), intermediate (p = 0)
1) length scales. We studied these mixing eﬃciencies for statistically stationary,

homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow ﬁelds stirring scalars sustained by a variety of steady but spatially

inhomogeneous scalar sources and sinks on periodic domains. We reach a number of conclusions:

→

Source, sink and statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow combinations exist

that realize both the upper and lower bounds’ scaling with respect to Pe—and in some cases

the prefactors as well—showing that the analysis is sharp at the most general level.

•

The small and intermediate scale mixing eﬃciencies

E0 are ultimately limited by
length scales in the source-sink distributions. That is, even if the eﬃciencies scale classically

E1 and

the inferred mixing lengths

κPe/U are limited by length scales deﬁned by the sources and

sinks rather than by the spectrum of scales in the ﬂow. On the other hand the upper bound

analysis does not prevent small scales in the ﬂow ﬁeld from enhancing suppression of the

variance at large scales, i.e.,

1, to an unlimited degree.

∼

E−

Suﬃciently “rough” scalar sources and sinks, in particular non-square-integrable distribu-

tions, necessarily produce sub-classical scaling of

E1 at high P´eclet numbers. In
such cases there is no residual suppression of variance in the vanishing diﬀusion limit for any

E0 and/or

ﬁnite mean kinetic energy statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic stirring.

The mixing eﬃciencies at various length scales need not scale the same as Pe

The analysis, simulations and modeling presented in this paper have addressed some fundamen-

tal questions regarding suppression of the long time averaged bulk scalar variance via stirring by

incompressible and statistically homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow ﬁelds, but compelling challenges

remain for future study. Among the unsolved problems open questions are:

37

•

•

•

•

Can the anomalous mixing eﬃciency bounds for measure-valued or fractal sources be achieved

by any statistically stationary homogeneous and isotropic ﬂow? This is a diﬃcult problem for

direct numerical simulations of the advection–diﬀusion equation because of the small spatial

scales that need to be resolved. An alternate simulation approach is particle tracking, by

following the evolution of many discrete particles moving with the ﬂow and diﬀusing and

approximating the continuous scalar concentration on an appropriately coarse grained level.

Can the small-ﬂow-scale enhancement of the large-scale mixing eﬃciency

1, as suggested

E−

by the upper bound in (III.43), be realized? It makes sense that stirring may be capable

of suppressing large-scale variance, even for negligible molecular diﬀusion, by transferring

scalar inhomogeneities from large length scales to small length scales via kinetic stretching

and folding mechanisms. The upper bound provides a quantitative estimate of this eﬀect

and it will be interesting to see to what extent it is an accurate estimate.

What is the mixing eﬃciency of “real” stationary homogeneous and isotropic turbulence

in two and three dimensions? The bounds derived here all apply to these ﬂows, and the

inevitable limitations on the mixing eﬃciency imposed by the source and sink structure

apply. Turbulent mixing by a ﬂuid with viscosity ν is often characterized by a Reynolds

number Re = U L/ν and a Schmidt number Sc = ν/κ. While the mixing eﬃciencies

Ep
Sc, the separate Reynolds and Schmidt number

are studied here as functions of Pe = Re

×

dependences are of interest, too. These questions can be investigated theoretically and via

direct numerical simulations in the periodic domain setting utilized here.

The uniform-wind optimal solution presented in Section IV is only appropriate for a one-

dimensional source distribution in a domain with periodic boundary conditions. It is optimal

by virtue of always having a component blowing along the source gradient, so no time and

little energy is wasted blowing along lines of constant source.

If the source has a more

complicated structure, then it is not generally possible to achieve such an eﬃcient ﬂow

while preserving incompressibility. Physical boundaries or a diﬀerent golbal topology (e.g. a

spherical domain as relevant to geophysical applications) will likewise invalidate the uniform-

wind solution. The general question is then: For a given distribution of sources and sinks

in a given domain, what is the optimal stirring strategy to achieve the greatest reduction

of bulk variance? This question has obvious relevance to engineering applications. While

we have answered it in the simplest setting of a single mode source-sink distribution on a

38

periodic domain, it is clearly a complex problem in general. It is not unlikely, however, that

intuition gained from the study of idealized models may contribute to the development of

valuable intuition for such systems.

Bounded domains with rigid walls are more appropriate for some engineering applications.

Then the scalar sources and/or sinks can be implemented by boundary conditions rather

than as body sources and sinks [55]. We can also imagine situations where ﬂuid and/or

imposed scalar ﬂuxes at boundaries contribute to the scalar variance in the bulk. How this

will aﬀect the eﬃciency scalings is an open question.

We have seen that very generally

A related problem of interest is the advection–diﬀusion of a passive scalar θ with decay rate

In applications ζ may have an interpretation as a chemical reaction rate or a radiative

relaxation rate relevant in meteorology or for other geophysical ﬂows on the sphere. A linear

amplitude damping term in the advection–diﬀusion equation introduces new features such

as competition between scalar decay and mixing to supress steady-state variances [50].

Finally, all the questions above can be posed for time dependent sources and sinks.

APPENDIX A: LOWER BOUND ON VARIANCE EFFICIENCY

One might expect the variance eﬃciency

E0 to have a lower bound of unity, implying that
stirring always decreases the variance. In order to derive a uniform (in Pe) lower estimate we can

search for the maximum variance subject to the steady-state production-dissipation constraint:

The solution of this optimization problem in Fourier space is

where µ is the Lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint

In the case of a dichromatic source with wavenumber k1 at amplitude s1 and k2 at amplitude

and a numerical evaluation of the roots reveals that the minimum value of the eﬃciency bound is

less than 1 for

ξ. Thus the variance production-dissipation balance alone does not rule out the

∀

existence of ﬂows that could increase the scalar variance.

APPENDIX B: STEADY UNIFORM WIND ON A δ-FUNCTION SOURCE

Taking the Fourier transform of the steady advection–diﬀusion equation (I.3) with a uniform

velocity ﬁeld along the xd-axis,

where kd is the dth component of the horizontal wavenumber. Now substitute ˆs(k) = const for

a δ-function source and after approximating the sums by integrals (since we are only interested in

the asymptotic behavior), we ﬁnd

d = 2 :

d = 3 :

The variances in the absence of stirring are found by calculating the integrals (B.2) with U = 0.

These anomalous scalings in Pe suggest that the uniform ﬂow is not the optimal allowed by the

bound for the δ-function source in both d = 2 and 3. This emphasizes the source-dependent nature

of the optimal stirrer.

APPENDIX C: STEADY SHEAR AT AN ANGLE

must satisfy

Given the internal layer solution we can compute the multi-scale mixing measures.

In fact, to

leading order the dependence of the eﬃciencies on the P´eclet number is the same. The diﬀerence is

in the prefactors. Figure 7 compares the scalings derived from the internal layer solution (including

prefactors) to the discrete data from the numerical solution and the numerical solution using the

random sine ﬂow.

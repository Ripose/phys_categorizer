Motivated by the numerical investigations of [1] Laval et al.
(1999), we develop a quasilinear theory of the 2D Euler equa-
tion and derive an integro-diﬀerential equation for the evo-
lution of the coarse-grained vorticity ω(r, t). This equation
respects all the invariance properties of the Euler equation
and conserves angular momentum in a circular domain and
linear impulse in a channel (as well as in an inﬁnite domain).
The explicit energy is not rigorously conserved as it is partly
transfered into ﬁne-grained ﬂuctuations but the total energy
is conserved. We prove a H-theorem for the Fermi-Dirac en-
tropy and make the connection with statistical theories of 2D
turbulence.

A fundamental diﬃculty in ﬂuid turbulence is the de-
velopement of motion at very small scales, down to the
dissipation scale, while numerical computations are lim-
ited by the scale of the numerical mesh. One cannot sim-
ply ignore the contribution of the small scales, otherwise
energy would accumulate at the grid mesh and produce
a bottle neck instability. In general, a turbulent viscos-
ity (or hyperviscosity) is introduced in order to provide a
source of dissipation and regularize the equations. How-
ever, this additional term is relatively ad hoc and breaks
the conservation laws of the Euler equation.

A small-scale parametrization of 2D turbulence can be
constructed on the basis of thermodynamical considera-
tions. Using a Maximum Entropy Production Principle
(MEPP), [2] Robert & Sommeria (1992) obtained an “op-
timal” relaxation equation for the coarse-grained vortic-
ity which respects all the conservation laws of the inviscid
dynamics. This approach was extended by [3] Chavanis
& Sommeria (1997) who derived a set of equations re-
specting in addition the invariance properties of the Eu-
ler equation. However, this thermodynamical approach is
based on the assumption that the system evolves towards
a maximum entropy state or a collection of maximum en-
tropy “bubbles” [4]. In this letter, we obtain a small-scale
parametrization of 2D turbulence starting directly from
the Euler equation. We prove a H-theorem and recover
the results of the statistical theory as an approximation
of our model.

For a two-dimensional

incompressible and inviscid

ﬂow, the Euler equation can be written:

∂ω
∂t

+ u∇ω = 0

u = −z ∧ ∇ψ

ω = −∆ψ

(1)

(2)

1

where ωz = ∇ ∧ u is the vorticity and ψ the streamfunc-
tion (z is a unit vector normal to the ﬂow). The velocity
can be expressed as an integral over the vorticity ﬁeld as

u(r, t) =

d2r′V(r′

→ r)ω(r′, t)

(3)

where

represents the velocity created in r by a vortex of unit
circulation located in r′ (r⊥ is the vector r rotated by
2 ). The term Vb(r′ → r) accounts for boundary eﬀects
+ π
(Vb = 0 in an inﬁnite domain) and can be calculated with
the method of “images”.

We assume that the initial condition consists of a patch
of uniform vorticity ω = σ0 surrounded by irrotational
ﬂow. This patch is unstable and the Euler equation
builds up a complicated ﬁlamentation at smaller and
In practice, we are only interested in
smaller scales.
the “coarse-grained” vorticity ω(r, t) deﬁned as the lo-
cal average of ω(r, t) on a cell of size ǫ2. The ﬂuctuating
vorticity ˜ω = ω − ω is simply the diﬀerence between the
exact vorticity and the smoothed-out vorticity. If we take
the local average of the Euler equation (1), we obtain a
convection-diﬀusion equation:

∂ω
∂t

+ u∇ω = −∇J

(5)

for the coarse-grained ﬁeld with a current J = ˜ω ˜u related
to the correlations of the ﬁne-grained ﬂuctuations.
In
turns, the ﬂuctuations depend on the smoothed-out ﬁeld
according to the equation:

∂ ˜ω
∂t

+ u∇˜ω = −˜u∇ω − ˜u∇˜ω + ˜u∇˜ω

(6)

obtained by substracting (1) and (5).

We shall now neglect the non linear terms which ap-
pear in the right hand side of equation (6). This “quasi-
linear approximation” is well-known in plasma physics
and in stellar dynamics for the Vlasov-Poisson system
(see, e.g, [5]) but, to our knowledge, it has never been ap-
plied to the 2D Euler system, although the equations are
relatively similar [6–8]. It is therefore interesting in itself
to develop this theory (Chavanis 1997, draft paper). In
addition, the recent numerical investigations of [1] Laval
et al.
(1999) have demonstrated that these nonlinear
terms are indeed negligible. The quasilinear theory can

therefore provide an accurate small-scale parametrization
of 2D turbulence.

We consider therefore the coupled system

we can immediately write down a formal solution of (8),
namely:

In this expression, the Greenian G refers to the ﬂuid par-
ticle r(t) and the Greenian G′ to the ﬂuid particle r′(t).
The contribution proportional to λ reﬂects some kind of
self-interaction (see equation (19)) and will be ignored in
the following. Using the properties:

˜ω(r, t) = G(t, 0)˜ω(r, 0)

−

dsG(t, t − s)˜u(r, t − s)∇ω(r, t − s)

(10)

and:

Z

Although very compact, this formal expression is in fact
extremely complicated.
Indeed, all the diﬃculty is en-
capsulated in the Greenian G(t, t − s) which supposes
that we can solve the smoothed out Lagrangien ﬂow:

dr
dt

= u(r, t)

between t and t − s.

The objective now is to substitute the formal result
(10) back into (7) and make some closure approximation
in order to obtain a self-consistant equation for ω(r, t).
If the vorticity were purely advected by the stochastic
velocity ﬁeld u (like a passive scalar), the interaction (3)
would be switched oﬀ and we would end up with a diﬀu-
sion equation for ω with a diﬀusion coeﬃcient D ∼ 1
4 τ ˜u2
where τ is the decorrelation time [7,9]. However, in the
case of the Euler equation, the velocity ﬂuctuations are
induced by the ﬂuctuations of the vorticity itself accord-
ing to:

˜u(r, t) = λ

d2r′V(r′

→ r)˜ω(r′, t)

(12)

Therefore, considering (10) and (12), we see that the vor-
ticity ﬂuctuations ˜ω(r, t) are given by an iterative pro-
cess: ˜ω(t) depends on ˜u(t − s) which itself depends on
˜ω(t − s) etc... Since |˜u|, of order ωǫ, is much smaller
than |u|, of order Lω (where L ≫ ǫ is the size of the
domain), we can solve this problem perturbatively. For
convenience, we have introduced a counting parameter
λ in (12) which will be set equal to one ultimately. To
order λ2, we obtain:

G(t1, t2) = G(t1, t3)G(t3, t2)

˜ω(r, t) = G(t, 0)˜ω(r, 0) + o(λ)

tions to obtain:

To close the system, it remains to evaluate the correlation
function ˜ω(r, t)˜ω(r′, t). We shall take [7]:
˜ω(r, t)˜ω(r′, t) = ǫ2δ(r − r′

)˜ω2(r, t)

(17)

A simple model for justifying (17) will be proposed in a
forthcoming article [10]. Now:

˜ω2 = (ω − ω)2 = ω2 − ω2

(18)

For the case that we consider, the exact vorticity ﬁeld ω
can take only two values ω = 0 and ω = σ0. This implies
that ω2 = σ0 × ω = σ0ω and therefore:
˜ω(r, t)˜ω(r′, t) = ǫ2δ(r − r′

)ω(σ0 − ω)

(19)

Substituting this expression in equation (16) and carry-
ing out the integration on r′′, we obtain:

We have written ω′
t−s ≡ ω(r′(t−s), t−s), ωt−s ≡ ω(r(t−
s), t − s), V µ(r′ → r)t ≡ V µ(r′(t) → r(t)) and V ν(r′ →
r)t−s ≡ V ν(r′(t − s) → r(t − s)) where r(t − s) is the
position at time t − s of the ﬂuid particle located in r =
r(t) at time t. It is determined by the characteristics (11)
of the smoothed-out Lagrangian ﬂow.

Equation (20) is a non Markovian integro-diﬀerential
equation: the value of ω in r at time t depends on the
value of the whole vorticity ﬁeld at earlier times. If the
decorrelation time τ is short, we can make a Markov
approximation and simplify the foregoing expression in

of course reminiscent of the Landau equation in plasma
physics. Note that even if |r′ − r| × K µν(r′ − r) diverges
like |r′ − r|−1 as r′ approaches r, the integral remains
well-behaved because the term in brackets goes to zero
simultaneously.

turbulence was stressed by [11] Chavanis (1998c) using
a point vortex model. Here, the drift is non linear in
ω so that (26) is not, strictly speaking, a Fokker-Planck
equation. This nonlinearity accounts for the constraint
ω(r, t) ≤ σ0 imposed at any time by the conservation of
the microscopic vorticity (see equation (1)).

Equation (21) respects the invariance properties of the
2D Euler equation and has the same structure as equation
(23) of [3] Chavanis & Sommeria (1997) derived on the
basis of thermodynamical arguments. In their work, the
constraints of the Euler equation were satisﬁed with the
aid of Lagrange multipliers. In this new approach, the
conservation laws follow naturally from the symmetrical
structure of equation (21) [10]. This is more satisfying
on a physical point of view. Moreover, in the thermody-
namical approach, the increase of entropy is postulated
whereas in the present situation an H-theorem for the

by taking the time derivative of (27), substituting for

which is clearly positive. It is remarkable that a quasilin-
ear theory is suﬃcient to generate a turbulent viscosity
(but also a drift) and a source of entropy. We don’t
necessarily have to advocate the non linear terms in (6)
to get these properties. Note also that the entropy as-
sociated with the (coarse-grained) Euler equation is the
Fermi-Dirac entropy (27) in agreement with the works of
[12] Miller (1990) and [13] Robert & Sommeria (1991) at
equilibrium. This conﬁrms that other proposed function-
als ( [14] Boltzmann entropy, [15] enstrophy, [16] Tsal-
lis entropy) are only approximate (see discussion in [17]
Brands et al. 1999).

A further connection with the statistical theory of 2D
turbulence can be found. Equation (21) is an integro-
diﬀerential equation whereas the equations derived from
the MEPP [2,7,3] are diﬀerential equations. The usual
way to transform an integro-diﬀerential equation into a
diﬀerential equation is to make a guess for the function
ω′ appearing in the integral. It makes sense to replace ω′
by its optimal value

In equation (30), we recover the form of the drift derived
by [11] Chavanis (1998c) in a point vortex model. The
drift coeﬃcient can be interpreted as an Einstein formula.

so as to conserve energy. Equation (32) can be in-
terpreted as a generalized Fokker-Planck equation [11].
Note that the present approach provides the value (31)
of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which was left unknown by
the variational principle. This value coincides with the
estimate of [7] Chavanis et al. (1996) and [9] Robert &
Rosier (1997) based on a passive scalar model.

In conclusion we have obtained a new equation for
the evolution of the coarse-grained vorticity in 2D tur-
bulence. This equation respects the invariance proper-
ties and conservation laws of the Euler equation. We
have proved a H-theorem for the Fermi-Dirac entropy
and made a connection with the statistical theory of 2D
turbulence. Previous relaxation equations [2,7,3] are re-
covered as an approximation of our model. The results
of this letter can be extended to an arbitrary spectrum
of vorticity levels [10] and can provide a useful small-
scale parametrization of 2D turbulence. These results
also complete the analogy between 2D turbulence and
stellar systems [5–8].

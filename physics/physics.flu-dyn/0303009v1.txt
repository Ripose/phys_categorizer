Abstract

We analyze the stability of a cylindrical Couette ﬂow under the impo-
sition of a weak axial ﬂow in case of a very short cylinder with a narrow
annulus gap.

We consider an incompressible viscous ﬂuid which is contained in the
narrow gap between two concentric short cylinders, where the inner cylin-
der rotates with constant angular velocity. The caps of the cylinders have
narrow tubes conically tapering to super narrow slits which allow for an
axial ﬂow along the surface of the inner cylinder.

The approximated solution for the Couette ﬂow for short cylinders was
found and used for the stability analysis instead of the exact but bulky
solution. The sensitivity of the Couette ﬂow to general small perturbations
and to the weak axial ﬂow was studied. We demonstrate that perturbations
coming from the axial ﬂow cause the propagation of dispersive waves in
the Taylor-Couette ﬂow.

The coexistence of a rotation and of an axial ﬂow requires to study
in addition to the energy and the angular momentum also the helicity of
the ﬂow. The approximated form for the helicity formula in case of short
cylinders was derived.

We found that the axial ﬂow stabilizes the Taylor - Couette ﬂow. The
supercritical ﬂow includes a rich variety of vortical structures including a
symmetric pair of Taylor vortices, an anomalous single vortex and quasi
periodic oscillating vortices. Pattern formation was studied at large for
rated ranges of azimuthal and axial Reynolds numbers. A region where
three branches of diﬀerent states occur was localized. Numerical simula-
tions in 3D and in axisymmetrical case of the model ﬂow are presented,
which illustrate the instabilities analyzed.

1 Introduction

Since the famous experiments of Taylor [1] in long cylinders many experimental
and theoretical investigations of the interesting phenomena of arising and evolu-
tion of Taylor vortices were done. The main part of these studies was devoted
to cases of long cylinders. It was done under the assumption that a suﬃciently
long cylinder and periodic boundary conditions will emulate the inﬁnitely long
cylindrical region well.
In addition such regions are convenient for theoretical
investigations. The experimental investigations of short cylinders started much
later and gave surprising results (see, for example, Benjamin and Mullin [2]),
which indicated that the zone and the magnitude of the inﬂuence of the caps of
the cylinders is much bigger and takes eﬀect on the type of motion in the whole
region. It was assumed that close to the caps of the cylinders the boundary layer
is directed from the outer to the inner cylinder as a result of the existence of
an Ekmans boundary layer. However, the experiments gave a more complicated
picture of the motions. There exists also an atypical layer in opposite direction,
from the inner to the outer cylinder connected withe the existence of the
i.e.
’anomalous mode’. The ﬁrst mathematical model which took the inﬂuence of
the cylinder caps into account was represented in the work of Schaeﬀer [3]. This
model is not very consistent and needs improvements. The role of the anomalous
mode was studied later numerically and experimentally in the works of Cliﬀe et
al [4], [5]. The transient features of the circular Couette ﬂow were investigated in
laboratory and numerical experiments (using the commercial program ’Nekton’
(Fluent GmbH) by Neitzel et al [6]. The results of the numerical experiments
were close to the laboratory experiments. In case of short cylinders with an as-
pect ratio Γ ∼ 1 (relation of annulus span to the annulus gap width, deﬁned in
section 2) usually only one pair of Taylor vortices arises. In general, this case is
considered to be not really interesting due to the poorness of the patterns to be
expected. But in the experiments of Aitta et al [7] a series of interesting ﬂow
patterns for short cylinders was found. A non-equilibrium tricritical points occurs
when a forward bifurcation becomes a backward bifurcation. In the Taylor - Cou-
ette problem the tricritical point can be observed for ΓT = 1.255 in the classical
case of a pure rotation of the inner cylinder without axial ﬂow as demonstrated
in [7] and later in [8]. The system of two vortices is symmetrical if the rotation
velocity does not exceed a critical velocity v1. If the velocity of the ﬂow is larger,
v > v1, then one vortex grows at the expense of the other one. In the case of
the forward bifurcation the symmetry is broken continuously and in the case of

2

the backward bifurcation - abruptly. In the phase transition language this is a
bifurcation of the second order or ﬁrst order correspondingly [9]. The continuous
transition was observed for Γ < ΓT and the abrupt one for ΓT < Γ < ΓC, where
ΓC = 1.292.

An exhaustive study of the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite length eﬀects is done for the
classical arrangement of two concentric cylinders with a very small aspect ratio
Γ ∈ [0.5, 1.6] and a relatively large annulus with a radius ratio (relation between
the radii of inner and outer cylinders, see section 2) of η = 0.667 for moderate
Reynolds numbers Re ∈ [100, 1500] in the work of Furukava, Watanabe, Toya &
Nakamura [10] in the case when the inner cylinder is rotating. The numerical
investigations were veriﬁed by experiments. The three main ﬂow patterns were
found which correspond to a normal two-cell mode, an anomalous one-cell mode
and a twin - cell mode. A steady case as well as an unsteady mode of the fully
developed ﬂow diﬀerent from wavy Taylor - Couette ﬂow were obtained.

There exists a series of experimental and theoretical works devoted to the
linear stability of the Taylor-Couette problem with implosed axial eﬀects. The
ﬁrst such analysis was done for the case of axisymmetric disturbances in a narrow
gap [11], [12]. In the work of Marques and Lopez [13] the linear stability of the
ﬂow in the annulus between two inﬁnitely long cylinders, driven by a constant
rotation and harmonic oscillation in the axial direction of the inner cylinder was
analyzed using Floquet theory. The axial eﬀects in the Taylor-Couette problem
were studied in the work [14] on two diﬀerent ﬂows. In the ﬁrst one the axial eﬀect
is introduced by an inertial axial sliding mechanism between the cylinders and
in the other one via an imposed axial pressure gradient. In all cases the annular
gap is much larger as in our case and the radius ratio is η = 0.5,
. . . , 0.8. The
stabilizing eﬀect of a periodical axial ﬂow was studied in the works [15], [16] and
[17]. In the work of Lueptow [18] the stability problem of a Taylor-Couette ﬂow
with axial and radial ﬂow was studied for a relatively large radius ratio η = 0.83
and pressure-drive axial ﬂow in the whole annulus. In all these studies it was
found that the axial ﬂow stabilized the Taylor-Couette ﬂow and enables a lot of
super critical states with a rich variety of patterns.

Nevertheless the theory of the Taylor - Couette ﬂow is by far from being
complete, so for instance the stability problem for the system of Taylor vortices
and a classical Couette ﬂow by inﬂuencing control of the cylinder caps. It is also
a little bit astonishing that the exact analytical solution for the Couette ﬂow
proﬁle with boundary conditions on cylinder caps was obtained only recently in
the work of Wendl [19]. His results expose a strong inﬂuence of the caps on the
ﬂow proﬁle. The diﬀerence between the two proﬁles with and without ﬁnite-
length eﬀects is approximately a logarithmic function of the aspect ratio Γ for a
wide range of radius ratios η. The solution is given in form of a slowly convergent
series which contains trigonometric and Bessel functions. To give a qualitative
analysis of instabilities one takes an exact solution as a base ﬂow to linearize the
Navier - Stokes equations. This type of solutions is not convenient to pursue the

3

topic further towards analytical studies of the instabilities.

In the present work we use the theory of small perturbations to study the
instability of the laminar Couette ﬂow in a short cylinder. The geometry of an
annular gap and the boundary conditions are given in the section 2. Our idea was
to get an analytical formula which is simpler than that in [19] but which gives us
an approximation of the Couette ﬂow with ﬁnite-length eﬀects which is as good
as that found in [19]. In the section 3 we describe this solution and discuss the
region of applicability of the done approximation.

The solution obtained for a short cylinder is well suitable as a base ﬂow for
a comprehensive study of instability eﬀects. This study is represented in the
section 4. The onset of the instability is predicted using the method of local
analysis, in which the equations governing the ﬂow perturbation are linearized.
For the very reason that the appearance of an instability depends not only on
the base ﬂow but also on the amplitude and the type of the ﬂow perturbation
two diﬀerent types of perturbations are studied in this section. We consider the
sensitivity of the Couette ﬂow under small perturbations corresponding to an
axial ﬂow which is the most important for industrial applications. We take the
case of a very narrow annulus η ∼ 1 which is typical for bearing or sealing systems
and in contrary to general expectation we get a rich family of ﬂow states. We
proved that the axial ﬂow stabilizes the Taylor - Couette ﬂow also in case of very
short cylinders and narrow annular gap with axial ﬂow directed as a thin layer
along the surface of the inner rotating cylinder.

The elaborate series of the numerical experiment was done with help of the
FLUENT 5.5/6.0. The detailed description of the grids used and others numerical
facilities is given in the section 6.

The change from one laminar ﬂow to another or a transition from a laminar
ﬂow to turbulence is a function of the base ﬂow considered as well as of the type of
small perturbations. We found a rich family of typical patterns on large intervals
of Reynolds numbers. The results of the numerical experiments are discussed in
the section 7.

2 The main problem

The study of the Couette - Taylor problem for the parameters deﬁned below was
stimulated by the industrial project [22]. In many technical systems the problem
of transmitting energy and momentum is solved using shafts and corresponding
bushes with or without radial sealing.
In a typical situation one is concerned
with a small Taylor-Couette annulus, narrow slits in between cylinders and with
axial and tangential oscillations or with a weak axial ﬂow along the surface of the
inner cylinder. In general, these systems are very complicated and it is necessary
to study more simple problems in order to isolate a particular mechanism and
to develop and test hypotheses governing their behavior. We separate here only

4

one of the most typical cases because of its technological importance and, from a
fundamental point of view, for its rich dynamics and try to describe all possible
ﬂow states in this case.

We consider the motion of the ﬂuid in an annulus between two cylinders as
represented in ﬁg. 1. The annulus dimensions are the gap width d, the annulus

corresponding dimensionless geometric parameters are the aspect ratio Γ = l
d and
the radius ratio η = rin
rout . We use these notations during the whole paper. For
many sealing or bearing systems Γ ∼ 1 and η ∼ 1. We ﬁxe in all our calculations
Γ = 1.02, η = 0.95356 .

We assume that the inner cylinder to turn at the constant rate ω. The outer
cylinder is at rest, the axial ﬂow has a constant velocity w0 and we suppose rinω ≫
w0. The equations of ﬂuid motion and boundary conditions will be rendered
dimensionless using d, as a unit for length. The radius of the inner cylinder will
be denoted by R = rin
in dimensionless units which will be used in all sections
d
of this paper.

The entrance way and the outgoing way for the axial ﬂow are very thin cylin-
drical slits with the gap width ˜d and the annulus span of slits denoted by ˜l. The
slits are long and narrow in comparison to the main annulus i.e. l ∼ ˜l, d ≫ ˜d.
The ends of the slits narrow conical to the lower order of scale that means the

most narrow part of the slit has the width
A more detailed picture of the slits is given in ﬁg. 7. The studied ﬂow states are
ee
very sensitive to the kind of perturbations. So we try to construct a situation
which is most adapted to technical facilities and imitate the sealing arrangements
with conical tapering slits.

d, which is very small, d ≫ ˜d ≫
ee

It is characteristically for quite all technical applications that the sealing
medium is oil with non vanishing viscosity. We will consider in our work an
incompressible viscous ﬂuid in the cylindrical annulus.

3 An approximation of the exact solution in

case of the rotating inner cylinder

The classical case of the Couette ﬂow of an incompressible viscous ﬂuid in an
annulus between two cylinders was investigated analytically in [19]. In compari-
son to the famous work of Taylor the author studied cylinders of a ﬁnite length
and got a much more complicated formula which describes the inﬂuence of the
cylinder caps on the ﬂow. As follows from experiments of Kageyama ([20]) if the
Reynolds number grows the inﬂuence of the Ekmans layer drops along the cylin-
der caps. As a result the proﬁle of the solutions diﬀers more and more from the
pure Couette solution because of the arising of secondary ﬂows in the annulus.

We will consider the ﬂow in the annular gap with the width d, the span l, and
radius of inner cylinder rin as on the ﬁg. 1 without slits. We suggest now that the
caps of the cylinders contact the inner cylinder and that there is no axial ﬂow in
the annulus. The equations of the ﬂuid motion and the boundary conditions will
be rendered dimensionless using v = rinω and P = (ν/d)2 as units for velocity
and the pressure. The scaling of the velocities and of other quantities will change
from section to section.

Due to the axial symmetry two of the components of the velocity vector

u(r, θ, z) vanish in this case and the velocity vector reads

u(r, z) = (0, V0(r, z), 0),

where V0(r, z) is the azimuthal component. The cylindrical Navier-Stokes equa-
tions can be reduced in this model to one equation,

We make an additional scaling in z−direction by Γ to reach the more convenient
situation that the both variables r and z lie in the interval [0, 1]. The considered

with βm = (2m−1)π
. Here I1 and K1 are modiﬁed Bessel functions. This solution
diﬀers from Taylor-Couette’s simple linear solution especially strong in cases of
short cylinders but remains an exact solution for long cylinders. The series in
(4) converges very slowly and it is diﬃcult to use it for the intended analytical
studies. This was the reason that we looked for simpler analytical representations
of this solution or for some good approximated solution.

We study the case of short cylinders, i.e. Γ ∼ 1, with a narrow gap, η ∼ 1,
and R ≫ 1. Under these assumptions and taking into account r ∈ [0, 1] we can

The agreement between the approximated and the exact solutions is very
good as can be seen from ﬁg. 2. The approximated solution (5) is stable for small
Reynolds numbers Re and can be used as a base state in a stability analysis.

We note an earlier attempt by Vladimirov [21] to ﬁnd an approximative solu-
tion which takes the inﬂuence of the caps into account , which, however, diﬀers
much more from the exact solution than ours.

4 Stability problem for the Taylor - Couette

ﬂow under small perturbations

4.1 Local stability study for a short cylinder

We consider the axisymmetrical stability problem of the Taylor-Couette ﬂow.
We assume that the velocity vector ˜u(r, z) which describes the ﬂuid motion in
the annular gap like on the ﬁg. 1 can be represented as a sum of two vectors
u(r, z) = (u, v, w) and v(r, z) = (0, V0, 0)

˜u(r, z) = v(r, z) + u(r, z) = (0, V0, 0) + (u, v, w),

was found with program FLUENT 5.5/6.0 in axisymmetric case for Re = 100.

where V0 describes the fundamental mode of the Couette ﬂow and u(r, z) a pertur-
bation of this mode. We assume also that the pressure ˜P can be also represented
as sum ˜P = P0 + p.

Here we use the dimensionless variables as introduced in the section 2 and
additionally we use the value d2/ν and Rω to render time and velocities dimen-
sionless too. We leave the same notations for the velocities in the dimensionless
case as above. It means that now |V0| ∼ 1 and from the conditions (7) |v| ≪ 1

The basic Taylor-Couette ﬂow is an axial inhomogeneous ﬂow in the case
of the short cylinder because of the cylinder caps inﬂuence. The inhomogeneity
leads to additional terms which make a diﬀerence between the system (8) and the
corresponding linearized Navier-Stokes equations for an inﬁnitely long cylinder.
Now we will prove that the additional terms causes the propagation of dispersive
waves in the Taylor - Couette ﬂow.

We remember that in the case of a short cylinder with very narrow gap we

have

Γ ∼ 1, η ∼ 1, R ≫ 1.

(14)

Under these assumptions we can simplify the system of equations (12) by replac-
(R+r)n (note r ∈ [0, 1]) by the constants 1
Rn , n = 1, 2. The oper-
ing the coeﬃcients
ators ∂z and ∂r can be replaced by the multiplicative operators ∂r ∼ 1/d, ∂z ∼ 1/l
or, in the dimensionless case, by

and neglected V0
system (12) only and obtain a simpliﬁed system of equations

R+r in the system (12). We collect now the leading terms of the

∂tv + δ Re ∂rV0∂zΨ − δ Re ∂zV0∂rΨ = ∆v,

where no-slip boundary conditions u|S = v|S = w|S = 0 on the inner surface S
of the annulus are adopted. In the system (17) we denoted ∆ = ∂2
zz, and
the constant δ ≡ 1

R is small, δ << 1.

The standard, straightforward way to investigate the stability problem would
consist in ﬁnding the exact solution of the eigenvalue problem corresponding to
the system of equations (17). Then the perturbations u(r, z) can be represented
as a series over the eigenfunctions. Alternatively, the system could be solved nu-
merically whereas a spatial discretization of the problem may be accomplished by
a solenoidal Galerkin scheme. In our case these procedures may be accomplished
numerically only and this is outside the scope of the present work.

Nevertheless we can give good qualitative characteristics of the ﬂow in the
annulus if we use a local stability analysis. This method was ﬁrst developed in
the analysis of an inhomogeneous complex astrophysical ﬂow [24],[25].
It give
us the possibility to establish the main physical processes of the considered ﬂuid
ﬂow system [26], [27].

The main idea of the local stability analysis method also named a method
of inﬁnitesimal perturbations can be described as follows. We suppose that the
amplitude and the gradients of the main state (the fundamental mode of the
Couette ﬂow in our case) is preserved under the perturbations. This means we
keep the values V0, ∂zV0 and ∂rV0 unaltered or assume that they are constant. For
all components of the perturbation vector u(r, z) = (u, v, w) and their derivatives
Taylor series are used which are truncated after the ﬁrst two terms. From the
physical point of view we assume that the perturbation scale is much smaller
than the typical scale of the axial inhomogeneity in the Taylor-Couette system.
This is the locality condition. As usual we represent the perturbation as a plain
wave,

Ψ ∼

Ψ exp (γt + i (krr + kzz)) , v ∼

v exp (γt + i (krr + kzz)) ,

(18)

Ψ and

v are the amplitudes of the waves. The vector of wave numbers
where
k = (kr, kz) deﬁnes the spatial direction of the plane wave propagation. The
locality condition requires that kr, kz ≫ 1. In (18), γ has the dimension of a

frequency and in the stability analysis it is called the time increment (or simply
increment). In the case of an intrinsic instability of the investigated system γ
will be positive. This means that the amplitude of the plane wave will inﬁnitely
increase with time. This is the unstable case.

The substitution of the plane wave (18) into the linearized system (17) results

As a consequence, in the system two diﬀerent regimes of motion can exist.

The motion in the annulus is strong inhomogeneous in z−direction because
of the inﬂuence of the cylinder caps. Let us now look for local increments on the
middle surface r = 0.5 on three diﬀerent lines z = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 . For z = 0.5 the
increment does not have any imaginary part and on this line the system does not
show any oscillations. In this case the real part of the increment is represented
in ﬁg. 5. On the lines z = 0.25, 0.75 the increment has an imaginary part and
the system has oscillations with frequencies which are directly proportional to
the gradient of the undisturbed state.

For ∂zV0 = 0 we have two real solutions for the increment and, consequently,

two branches of non-oscillating solutions.
The two branches of the increment given by Eq.(19) may have also an oscillating
character. For ∂zV0 6= 0 we deal with two oscillating solutions corresponding to
waves of the inertial type. If additionally kz∂rV0 − kr∂zV0 = 0 holds than these
In the intersection point

γ± = −k2 we have to do with a time decreasing solution. On the other hand the
perturbations with kz∂rV0 − kr∂zV0 ≈ 0 have the possibility to exchange energy.

4.2 Local stability of the Couette ﬂow under a small axial

perturbation ﬂow

The study of the stability problem of the Couette ﬂow was done up to now for
arbitrary small perturbations. Let’s consider the eﬀects of an axial ﬂow near the
surface of the inner cylinder. This ﬂow can be generated by the pair of Taylor

vortices or an axial ﬂow through the narrow slits in the caps of the cylinders near
the surface of the inner cylinder as shown in ﬁgure 1.

In order to simplify the study we suggest that the axial velocity w(r, z)
has a nonzero value w(R, z) on the surface of the inner cylinder. Addition-
ally we suggest that the boundary condition is homogeneous in z−direction,
i.e. w(R, z) = ζ = const holds. Here we can neglect the dependence on the
z−coordinate. The constant constituent of the axial velocity distribution can be
removed by an Galilean transformation z′ = z − ζ (1 + R) t; z′ → z. The bound-
ary condition w(R, z) = ζ 6= 0 provides in the narrow gap approximation the
linear velocity proﬁle in the r−direction

w ≈ ζ (1 − (r − R)) = ζ (1 + R) − ζr.

We will simplify this system of equations. We remind that we investigate the inﬂuence
of small perturbations and from the conditions (7) ζ ≪ V0 or ζ ≪ 1 follows immediately.
We expand the coeﬃcients in the system into a series with respect to the parameter
δ = 1/R and keep the main terms only. The approximated system for the stream
function Ψ and for the azimuthal velocity v has the structure

(21)

As in the general case in the previous point 4.1 we will study the stability problem
under small local perturbations. So the perturbation scale is much smaller than a
typical scale of the inhomogeneity in the system. This locality condition implies to the
inequalities

kr ≫ 1, kz ≫ 1.

In the same way we assume that the values V0, ∂zV0 and ∂rV0 change very slowly
in comparison to the perturbations so that they can be represented by Taylor series
truncated after the ﬁrst two terms. As usual we assume that the perturbation u(r, z) =
(u, v, w) has the form of a wave with time dependent amplitudes and with a time
dependent wave number in r−direction,

Ψ =

Ψ (t) exp (i (kr (t) r + kzz)) ,

Perturbations as studied here were considered in ﬂuid dynamics since Lord Kelvin, but
it has been realized only recently that these perturbations can play a trigger role in
the subcritical turbulence transition. These untypically properties of the ﬂow resulting
from the fact that the corresponding LNSE operator is non-self-adjoint for shear ﬂows
such as a plane Couette ﬂow [28], [29], a Poiseuille ﬂow [30], a counter-rotating Taylor-
Couette ﬂow [31], [32], a boundary layer [33], a Kepler rotation [28]. Apart from
the modes of the discrete spectrum there exist plenty of modes of the discontinuous
spectrum. The algebraic time evolution of these modes can achieve large amplitudes
which can reach hundredfold of the initial values of amplitudes. Another remarkable
property of these modes is their trait to redistribute energy and momentum between
diﬀerent types of perturbations [34], [35].

To give the qualitative description of an impact from an axial ﬂow on the stability
of the Couette ﬂow we will ﬁnd the increment for a ﬁxed instant time. Analogously to
(18) we have the representation

Ψ (t) ∼ exp (γt) ,

for the time dependent amplitudes of the wave (22).
If we virtually hold unaltered
the time-dependence of kr (t) we can consider the stability analysis local in time. The
substitution of the formula (27) into the system of equations (26) leads to an algebraic
equation for the increment. We get now two solutions of this system for the increment

For small ζ Re the dispersion curves have the same form as considered in the previous
section (without any axial ﬂow). In the intersection area kz∂rV0 − kr∂zV0 ≈ 0 we have
now

This dispersion equation is similar to the equation for the Rossby waves for inhomoge-
neous rotation of the Earth or othetrs systems. The wave number kr(t) is no longer ﬁxed

point Imγ (kr(t)) or Reγ (kr(t)) will move along the branches (similar to the branches
on the ﬁg. 3 - ﬁg. 5) with time. Chagelishvili and Chkhetiani [34] have proved that
under the inﬂuence of the shear the ﬂow frequencies of the Rossby waves and inertial
waves will be modiﬁed so that they take the same values. This circumstance leads to
the energy exchange between diﬀerent modes in the ﬂow. The same mechanism of the
energy exchange is characteristic for the system (26).

Suppose that we start the motion near the intersection point. One mode is unstable
and starts to grow while the second mode will dissipate. In the intersection point their
frequencies are very close to each other and a resonance interaction may take place. In
this case the dissipative mode loses the main part of its energy. Thus, we have found
a mechanism for the instability which may be responsible for transport and exchange
of energy and angular momentum.

If we analyze the solutions of the system (26) we notice that axial ﬂow leads to a
strong diﬀerentiation in the energy growth of the perturbations in dependence on the
axial level. This dependence is represented for two Reynolds numbers in ﬁg. 6. This
asymmetry can be the seed for the symmetry breaking in the Taylor-Couette system
in short cylinders.

We can assume that the same mechanism work also without any axial ﬂow in the
system. Consider two symmetrical counter rotating Taylor vortices in the annulus.
Then we have in the annular gap a radial distribution of the axial velocity component
which is oppositely directed in diﬀerent parts of the annular gap.
If now a small
perturbation ampliﬁed the circulation in one of the vortices for a small interval of time
then radial gradients of the axial velocity will show up in diﬀerent parts of the gap.
Therefore the degree of growth of perturbations in the continuous spectrum will be
diﬀerent in both parts of the gap and the faster growing perturbation can trigger an
irreversible process of symmetry breaking.

5 A symmetry breaking and helicity conserva-

tion law

The classical Taylor - Couette problem with pure rotation of one or both cylinders
posses Z2 and SO(3) symmetries. The implementation of an axial ﬂow immedi-
ately destroyes the Z2 mirror symmetry. The axial perturbation ﬂow ampliﬁes in-
homogeneously diﬀerent intrinsic modes in the studied states as we proved in the
previous section.
It results in a reach variety of super critical stationary and quasi
periodical states. This symmetry breaking for short cylinders can be considered as a
generation of certain helicity states.

The helicity is a topological characteristic of the ﬂow and it is the second inviscid

integral invariant for the Euler equations. The helicity is deﬁned by

H =

u · [∇ × u] dV,

(30)

Z
V

where the vector Υ ≡ ∇ × u deﬁnes the vorticity of the ﬂow. The helicity is a pseudo
scalar because of

H (−r) = −H (r) .

It is well known that the helicity is an important quantity in the study of dynamics
and stability of complicated vortex structures and ﬂows. The states with maximum of
helicity correspond to the states with minimum of energy [36], [37], [38].

In the same way as we get the evolution equation for the energy of the system

∂tE =

p · undS − ν

[∇ × u]2 dV

I
S

we obtain the following evolution equation for the helicity,

∂tH =

[∇ × u]n

[∇ × u] · [∇ × [∇ × u]] dV,

(31)

u2
2

(cid:18)

−

p
ρ (cid:19)

I
S

where n is the unit normal vector orthogonal to the boundary surface S.

For the inviscid ﬂuids the right hand side of equation (31) reduces to the ﬁrst term.
The helicity conserves if the normal component of the vorticity on the boundary surface
disappears, [∇ × u]n = 0, or if we have a potential ﬂow. Let S include a bounded
volume of an ideal ﬂuid with Υ 6= 0 and H 6= 0 then the helicity will be conserved
by the motion. For very small viscosity ν 6= 0 the helicity is no longer conserved but
it changes very slowly because of the negligibleness of the second term in (31). As a
consequence, for large Reynolds numbers we can treat the helicity as an approximately
conserved quantity.

In a classical Taylor-Couette system with mirror symmetric boundary conditions we
expect an even number of counter-rotating vortices. The growth of anomalous modes
and the phenomenon of appearing of time-dependent states can be considered as a
mirror symmetry breaking process and a generation of states with a deﬁnite sign of the

the formula to the case of short cylinders. The components of the vorticity Υ are

The axial ﬂow generates a constant stream of helicity and angular momentum through
the annulus. It is an important source of the symmetry breaking in the system.

6 Numerical facilities

Major advances in computer technologies and numerical techniques have made possible
to propose an alternative or at least a complementary approach to the classical and
analytical techniques used in laboratory experiments. Computational Fluid Dynamics
becomes part of the design process. But discontinuities or deep gradients lead to
computational diﬃculties in the classical ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, although for the
ﬁnite element methods often a suitable variational principle is not given. Therefore,
we consider the ﬁnite volume methods, which are based on the integral form over a cell
instead of the diﬀerential equation. Rather than a pointwise approximation at the grid
points, we break the domain into grid cells and approximate the total integral over
each grid cell. It is actually the cell average, which equals this integral divided by the
volume of the cell.

We consider the axial symmetric case as well as the full 3D ﬂow in the annulus.
The numerical method allows to choose a so-called segregated or a coupled solver. The
simulation process consists of (see e.g. [39])

• division of the domain into discrete control volumes (construction of the compu-

tational grid),

• integration of the governing equations (in axial-symmetric or in full 3D form) on
the individual control volumes to construct algebraic equations for the discrete
variables (velocity, pressure, temperature and other parameters),

• linearization and solution of the algebraic system to yield updated values of the

variables.

17

Both the numerical methods of the segregated and the coupled solvers employ a similar
ﬁnite volume process, but the approach used to linearize and solve the equations is
diﬀerent.

The FLUENT 5.5/6.0 [40] simulation and post-processing program was applied for
the numerical calculation of the ﬂow. The unsteady 2D axisymmetric or 3D version
of the Navier-Stokes equations is solved as described using ﬁnite volume discretization
on a structured quadrilateral grid (ﬁg. 7). The ﬁnite volume method has a ﬁrst order

2D structural grid for the annulus and the slits with 7690 quadrilateral

upwind scheme and constant relaxation factors, while the SIMPLE procedure for the
pressure-velocity coupling is applied.

The grid is generated with the help of GAMBIT program and characterized by a
large diﬀerence (100 times) between boundary edges. But it was possible to save the
grid structural and quadrilateral. The smallest inﬂow and outﬂow faces of the grid
are divided uniformly by 20 nodes, whereas the nodes in the bigger geometry of the
axial ﬂow are a more concentrated near the boundary because some vortices can arise
there if the Reynolds number is large [41]. The major volume of the annular gap is
divided 50x70 nodes, uniformly in the axial direction and linear condensing in the radial
direction.

As next, we set up a 2D axisymmetric model, using a rotating reference frame. The
time step is selected to be 1
80 of a single rotation. It helps to determine the ﬂow motion
state in the quarters of the rotation circle (θ = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2). Each time step includes
30 iterations or fewer if the solution converges with the residual of order O(10−5).

The plane of the 3D grid that corresponds to 2D axisymmetric model have to be
coarser, because of the large diameter of the inner cylinder and therefore of the large
number of cells in the projection on the (r, θ)-plane. These are only 10 nodes on the
inﬂow and outﬂow faces in the conical tapering of the slits and 25x30 in the annulus of
the slits (ﬁg. 8). It results in 1087040 hexahedral cells, that is close to the limit for a
computation and post-processing on a single processor in an acceptable time. Another,
more complicated 3D simulation would be possible using parallel computing [42]. Such
a program is used to being written with the Help of Message Passing Interface (MPI)
[43] or some other speciﬁc approaches [44]. But this is the aim of further investigations
and developments.

18

Figure 8: 3D grid with 1087040 hexahedral cells.

Some test simulations showed, that the 3D case is not sensitive enough to determine
the very small scale instabilities correctly. Although, the results of the 3D and 2D
axisymmetric simulations on the same grid are equivalent. It was veriﬁed using the
same coarser grid for the 2D case or by solution of the stationary problem without
instabilities. A ﬁner grid for the 2D axisymmetric case, by contrast, does not give more
substantial changes to the behavior of the unstable ﬂow. So, the 2D axisymmetric case
(ﬁg. 7) with 7690 quadrilateral grid cells is chosen and can be considered without loss
of accuracy for all computations in that geometry.

7 Pattern structure in the annulus under inﬂu-

ence of the axial ﬂow

In numerical experiments which simulated the ﬂow in the annular gap as in ﬁg. 1
and more detailed in ﬁg. 7 both axial symmetrical and 3D cases were studied. 3D
calculations had been done prepared for a large number of examples. But it became
apparent that no torsion or other remarkable 3D eﬀects arose in the system for Re ≤
6000. Therefor we used for further numerical investigations axisymmetrical case which
saved a lot of time and computer capacity. As a graphical representation of the results
in 3-D cases on a paper sheet does not show the interesting region in suﬃcient detail so
that we represent only one ﬁg. 9 which gives an impression, that the processes under
investigation are indeed mostly axisymmetrical.

19

Figure 9: 3D simulation of the two symmetrical stationary vortices. Only one
of the vortices is represented to avoid an overload of the left ﬁgure. The counter
lines of the velocity magnitude are given in 3D case on the left and in cross
sections on the right right by θ = 0, π/2, π, where ν = 0.1(10−3 m2
s ), w = 0.016 ,
umax = 0.060 , Re = 1256.0 , Reax = 0.1 .

In all investigations the inner cylinder rotates with the same azimuthal velocity
V0 = 2πωrin on the surface of the inner cylinder. We used this value to render other
velocities dimensionless. The weak axial ﬂow is directed on all ﬁgures from left to right.
The entrance and outgoing slits in the ends of conical tapering have the radius ratio
˜η = 0.99992.

We found that there exist four diﬀerent ﬂow states with typical patterns in depen-
dence on the relation between azimuthal and axial Reynolds numbers. The azimuthal
Reynolds number Re is deﬁned by Re = V0 d/ν and the axial Reynolds number by
Reax = wmax d/ν.

We studied a pure rotation and then switched on an axial ﬂow to investigate the
sensitivity of the ﬂow patterns to small axial perturbations. The pattern structure
is very sensitive to the appearance of an axial ﬂow. We looked for very weak axial
ﬂow with Reax ≪ Re nevertheless the pattern structure changed immediately under
the inﬂuence of the axial ﬂow. We studied the states distribution in the regions Re ∈
[0, 12000] and Reax ∈ [0, 10]. The results for the most interesting part are that for
Re ∈ [0, 2500] and Reax ∈ [0, 1] and they are represented on the schematic diagram
ﬁg. 10.

Let us consider the pure rotation case without any axial ﬂow. The most probable
state for a short cylinder with an aspect ratio Γ ∼ 1 can be described as follows. The
nearly quadratic cross section of the annulus is ﬁlled with two counter rotating stable
Taylor vortices as represented on the ﬁg. 11. We proved that this structure remains
mirror symmetric for a large region of azimuthal Reynolds numbers, Re ∈ [0, 2500].

0.

The investigated states are denoted in ﬁg.10 by boxes, (cid:3), on the horizontal axes. All
of them have quite the same structure - two stationary Taylor vortices in the annulus
up to very high azimuthal Reynolds numbers.

An enlargement of the azimuthal Reynolds numbers leads to the second state in
the annulus. For very large azimuthal Reynolds numbers Re > 4000 the intrinsic
instabilities give rise to perturbed states with a lot of small vortices. This ﬂow pattern
can be interpreted as a region with a ﬁne-grained structure overlaid with a large scale
structure - three Taylor-like vortices (see ﬁg. 12). Consider now the onset on an axial

ﬂow with relatively small velocity. The existence of the axial ﬂow can be considered
as a small perturbation of the base ﬂow with pure azimuthal velocity. In the region of
the azimuthal Reynolds numbers Re ≤ 1500 the axial ﬂow promoted one of the counter
rotating Taylor vortices in appropriate direction. As result the annulus will be ﬁlled
also for very small axial amplitudes of the axial ﬂow with one stable vortex (see ﬁg. 13).
We see the abrupt change of the patterns structure from two stable Taylor vortices to
one by switching on an axial ﬂow. This is the third pattern structure observed in this
system. It is denoted by • on the ﬁg.10.

In the region on the Reynolds numbers Reaz ∼ 1500, Reax ∼ 0, 4 there exists a

22

branch point in which three possible ﬂow states meet. For all axial Reynolds numbers
0.05 < Reax < 4 and Re < 1500 it is the ﬁrst branch for which is characterized by one
stable vortex in the annulus (ﬁg.13). For 1250 < Re < 2400 and for the small axial

Reynolds numbers 0 < Reax < 0.64 a second branch with two stable Taylor vortices
appears (ﬁg.11). For Reaz > 1500 and 0.3 < Reax < 0.9 the third branch appears with
two quasi periodically natural oscillating vortices (ﬁg.14).

This branch representes non stationary states. The energy and momentum of the
system show also typical quasi periodical oscillations. The time dependence of the
energy is given on the ﬁg. 15. The time dependence of the angular momentum is of the

23

same type. We rendered the energy dimensionless using its value for small Reynolds
numbers, Re = 251.2, Reax = 0.02 . In ﬁg. 15 we also see that maximal values for
the energy are smaller in the perturbation state as in the non perturbed ﬂow. We will

distinguish two diﬀerent types of energy in the system - the rotation or toroidal energy,
deﬁned by

named also poloidal energy. Correspondingly with Reynolds numbers the toroidal
energy is three order larger as the last one. But the intrinsic instabilities in the system
lead to steady energy exchange between diﬀerent motion types. This exchange we
demonstrate by a parametric representation in the plane of both energies in ﬁg. 16.

The ﬂow ﬁeld between diﬀerently shaped bodies of revolution were studied exper-
imentally or theoretically rarely. The experimental work devoted to the case which is
somewhat analogously to the motion in the conical slits at the caps of cylinders in our
case was done by Wimmer [45]. For a rotating cylinder in a stationary cone he proved

24

and Epol in the plane of both energies by Re = 5108 , Reax = 6, 333.

that due to the non constant gap diﬀerent types of motion can coexist in the gap. By
the growth of the Reynolds numbers the ﬁrst vortices appear at the location of the
largest gap size and are deformed, having larger axial extension. The numerical studies
in our geometry conﬁrm this statement as can be seen on the ﬁg. 12.

8 Conclusions

The convenient asymptotic representation for the exact steady solution of the Taylor-
Couette problem was found in the case of closed short cylinders Γ ∼ 1 (section 3). The
found approximated solution (5) will be an exact solution for inﬁnitely large viscosity
or for Re → 0. For ﬁnite Reynolds numbers a ﬂow in a thin layer along the caps of
the cylinder can arise. We estimated the radial and axial components of its velocity.
At ﬁrst blush in the case of the strong nonlinear motion the estimation u/V0 ∼ R−1/2,
w/V0 ∼ R−1/2 must hold. This follows from the comparison of the nonlinear terms in
the Navier-Stokes equations. But the numerical computations for the short cylinders
with R ≫ 1 and large Reynolds numbers lead to another estimation, u/V0 ∼ R−1,
w/V0 ∼ R−1, which can be obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of
very large viscosity. In ﬁg. 17 we represent the radial component of the dimensionless
velocity only. For the other component the pattern distribution is quite the same.

Figure 17: The distribution of the radial component of the dimensionless velocity
max ˜u in the Taylor-Coutte ﬂow for diﬀerent states in dependence on the Reynolds
numbers Re and Reax. Two Taylors vortices in the annulus are denoted by (cid:3),
one stable vortex by •, natural oscillation state of two vortices by ⋆.

From the estimations it follows that the azimuthal component of the velocity has
the main inﬂuence on the stability of the system. Consequently, we can use for our
qualitative stability analysis the found approximated solution.

The stability analysis done in section 4 showed that the inhomogeneity of the base
ﬂow in the radial direction as well as the axial ﬂow cause a perturbation of the Rossby
waves type. We proved that the Z2−symmetry breaking due to the axial ﬂow in the
Taylor-Couette ﬂow is in the same time the helicity symmetry breaking (section 5).
The states with non-zero helicity can accrue in the system (section 7). The energy
oscillations in the case of the unsteady pattern with natural oscillations as in ﬁg. 15
correspond to the helicity oscillations in the system.This can be seen from ﬁg. 14.

The weak axial ﬂow in an annulus between the rotating inner cylinder and the ﬁxed
outer cylinder has several important engineering applications in particular if the axial
ﬂow is directed as a thin layer along the surface of the rotating cylinder. We studied
this case and proved that the axial ﬂow stabilizes the motion and that in a system with
very narrow annulus diﬀerent super critical states are possible (section 7). We remark
that experiments in short cylinders with an aspect ratio of Γ ∼ 1 without any axial
ﬂow showed a poor variety of states [46], [47]. But for smaller aspect ratio all the states
which we described in our case can be observed. This behavior of the Taylor-Couette
system can be interpreted as follows. The inﬂuence of the weak axial ﬂow along the
surface of the inner cylinder can be considered as a change in the geometry, i.e., as
a shortening of the axial length of the cylinder. This interpretation is supported by
simple estimations.

For technical applications it is important to describe not only the velocity ﬁeld but
also the pressure distribution in the device. The pressure diﬀerences in the annulus
coming from the vortex motion can be estimated as R−1 of the pressure diﬀerence
corresponding to the axial ﬂow.

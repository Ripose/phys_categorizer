We study the eﬀect of interactions between objects ﬂoating at ﬂuid interfaces, for the
case in which the objects are primarily supported by surface tension. We give conditions
on the density and size of these objects for equilibrium to be possible and show that two
objects that ﬂoat when well-separated may sink as the separation between the objects is
decreased. Finally, we examine the equilbrium of a raft of strips ﬂoating at an interface,
and ﬁnd that rafts of suﬃciently low density may have inﬁnite spatial extent, but that
above a critical raft density, all rafts sink if they are suﬃciently large. We compare our
numerical and asymptotic results with some simple table-top experiments, and ﬁnd good
quantitative agreement.

1. Introduction

A common table-top demonstration of the eﬀects of surface tension is to ﬂoat a metal
needle horizontally on water: even though the density of the needle is much greater
than that of water, the needle is able to remain aﬂoat because of the relatively large
vertical component of surface tension. This eﬀect is a matter of life or death for water-
walking insects Bush & Hu(2006), and is also important in practical settings such as
the self-assembly of small metallic components into macroscopic structures via capillary
ﬂotation forces Whitesides & Grzybowski(2002). In this engineering setting an object
should not only ﬂoat when isolated at the interface, but must also remain aﬂoat after
it has come into contact with other interfacial objects, and portions of the meniscus
that supported it have been eliminated. Although the interactions that cause interfacial
objects to come into contact and form clusters have been studied extensively see, for
example, Mansﬁeld, Sepangi & Eastwood(1997), Saif(2002), Vella & Mahadevan(2005),
the implications of such interactions on the objects’ ability to remain aﬂoat have not
been considered previously.

Here we consider the eﬀects of these interactions via a series of model calculations that
shed light on the physical and mathematical concepts that are at work in such situations.
For simplicity, the calculations presented here are purely two-dimensional, though the
same physical ideas apply to three-dimensional problems.

2. Two horizontal cylinders

Perhaps the most natural way to characterise the eﬀects of interaction is to ask how
the maximum vertical load that can be supported by two ﬂoating cylinders varies as the
distance between them is altered. We thus consider two cylinders of inﬁnite length lying

horizontally at the interface between two ﬂuids of densities ρA < ρB, as shown in ﬁgure
1. We assume that these cylinders are non-wetting so that the contact angle θ, a property
of the three phases that meet at the contact line, satisﬁes θ > π/2.

We non-dimensionalise forces per unit length by the surface tension coeﬃcient, γAB,
ρA)g)1/2, and use non-dimensional

variables henceforth. We wish to determine the maximum weight per unit length, W ,
that can be supported by each of two identical cylinders with radius R and centre–centre
separation 2∆.

To remain aﬂoat each individual cylinder must satisfy a condition of vertical force
balance: their weight (or other load) must be balanced by the vertical contributions of
surface tension and the hydrostatic pressure acting on the wetted surface of the cylinder.
We assume that an external horizontal force is applied to maintain the separation of the
cylinders and so do not consider the balance of horizontal forces explicitly.

Using the notation of ﬁgure 1, the vertical force balance condition may be written

W = U1 + U2 where

Ui ≡ −

sin(θ + ψi)

−

H0R sin ψi + 1

2 R2(ψi + sin ψi cos ψi)

(i = 1, 2),

(2.1)

are the contributions to the vertical upthrust provided by the deformation on each half
of the cylinder separately, and H0 is the height of the cylinders’ centres above the unde-
formed free surface. Physically, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (2.1) is the vertical
component of surface tension, and the second and third terms quantify the resultant of
hydrostatic pressure acting on the wetted perimeter of the cylinder. The latter is given
by the weight of water that would ﬁll the dashed area in ﬁgure 1 see Keller(1998).

The angles ψ1 and ψ2 are determined by the interfacial shape, which is governed
by the balance between hydrostatic pressure and the pressure jump across the inter-
face associated with interfacial tension. This balance is expressed mathematically by the
Laplace–Young equation. In two dimensions this is

HXX = H(1 + H

where H(X) is the deﬂection of the interface (again measured positive upwards) from
the horizontal, and subscripts denote diﬀerentiation. Since the exterior meniscus extends
to inﬁnity, the ﬁrst integral of (2.2) is particularly simple in this instance and allows the
height of the contact line, H

, to be related to the interfacial inclination, φ, via

With the angles ψ1 and ψ2 calculated, W (H0) can be determined from (2.1), and the
maximum load that can be supported, Wmax, can be found numerically by varying H0.
Of particular interest is the dependence of Wmax on the cylinder separation, which is
R2 in ﬁgure 2. This plot includes the
shown for several values of the Bond number B
limiting case B = 0, corresponding to the application of two point forces to the interface.

≡

The results presented in ﬁgure 2 show that as the distance between two cylinders
decreases, the maximum vertical load that can be supported by each cylinder decreases.
Physically, this result is intuitive since even though the interior meniscus is not completely
eliminated in this instance, the vertical force that this meniscus can exert on the cylinder
is diminished by the symmetry requirement that HX (∆) = 0. In particular, for small B
and ∆ the total force that can be supported by each cylinder is around half of that which
can be supported by an isolated cylinder. This corresponds to the simple physical picture
that for small Bond number, the restoring force is supplied primarily by the deformation
of the meniscus Hu, Chan & Bush(2003); when the interior meniscus is eliminated, the
contact line length per cylinder, and hence the force that surface tension can provide,
are halved. From this we expect that very dense objects that ﬂoat when isolated at an
interface might sink as they approach one another. Since ﬂoating objects move towards
one another due to capillary ﬂotation forces see Mansﬁeld, Sepangi & Eastwood(1997),
for example, it seems likely that this eﬀect may be ubiquitous for dense objects ﬂoating
at an interface and may also have practical implications.

For B = 0 we can compute the asymptotic form of Wmax for ∆

1 by noting that
for small separations the interior meniscus has small gradients and the Laplace–Young
equation (2.2) may be approximated by HXX = H, which has the solution H(X) =
∆)/ cosh ∆. Thus, the vertical force provided by the deformation is W =

which compares favourably with the numerically computed results presented in ﬁgure 2.

3. Two touching strips

Whilst the scenario considered in the previous section may be relevant in practical
situations, it does not lend itself to particularly simple experimental validation. To allow
for such a comparison, we now consider the equilibrium of two inﬁnitely long, shallow
strips of dimensional thickness ℓct, width 2ℓcβ, and density ρs, ﬂoating with their long
edges in contact so that the interior meniscus is completely eliminated. The conﬁgu-
ration is shown schematically in ﬁgure 3. Here, we are no longer bound by a contact
angle condition but instead assume that the meniscus is pinned to the uppermost cor-
ners of the strips. The additional complication of the strip’s angle of inclination to the
horizontal, α, is determined by the balance of torques. (This condition is satisﬁed auto-
matically for shapes with circular cross-section and constant contact angle, as shown by
Singh & Hesla(2004).)

Equating moments about the point of contact (thereby eliminating the need to calcu-
late the tension force that the strips exert on one another) and balancing vertical forces,
we obtain the conditions for equilibrium

vertical force contribution of the ends (since the strips are of ﬁnite length), which may
be shown to be equivalent to an uncertainty in the eﬀective value of

between our experiments and theory in this instance is very good.

4. The ﬂoating of a ﬂexible raft

By adding additional strips to a ﬂoating pair of strips, a ﬂexible raft is formed. Given
the analysis of the preceding sections it is natural to expect that as the raft is lengthened
in this manner, there will come a point where its weight (which scales with its total
length) exceeds the force that can be supplied by surface tension (which is constant) and
so the raft should sink. The situation is complicated by the fact that the raft may bow
in its middle, displacing a considerable amount of liquid in this region, as pointed out by
Saif(2002). We now address the question of whether, for a raft of given weight per unit
length, there is a maximum raft length before sinking occurs.

We tackle this problem by treating the raft as a continuum and formulating an equation

4.1. Governing equation
We use a variational approach to determine the shape (X(S), H(S)) of the raft and the
surrounding meniscus, though the same result may also be obtained by considering the
force balance on an inﬁnitesimal raft element. The non-dimensional arc-length, S, is mea-
sured from the raft’s axis of symmetry at S = 0, with the two ends of the raft being at
L. For simplicity, we assume that the raft does not have an intrinsic bending stiﬀ-
S =
ness, although this may not be the case in general Vella, Aussillous & Mahadevan(2004).
The variational principle states that raft shapes must minimise the energy of the system
over variations in H(S) and X(S), subject to the constraint that X 2
S = 1. Introduc-
ing a Lagrange multiplier λ(S) associated with this constraint, we ﬁnd that equilibrium
raft shapes extremise

The ﬁrst two terms in the integral (4.1) correspond to the gravitational energy of the
displaced ﬂuid and the raft, the third term is the surface energy of the uncovered liquid
area, and the ﬁnal term ensures that the constraint X 2
S = 1 is satisﬁed. Note that
S + H 2
a small increase in arc-length such that X 2
S > 1 increases the energy of the system
so that the Lagrange multiplier λ(S) may be interpreted physically as the tension in the
raft/meniscus. That the raft can support a tension at all may seem counterintuitive but
is a simple consequence of the attractive capillary interaction between two neighbouring
strips which may resist a tension up to that of the interface itself.

In the limit of small deformations (4.3) reduces to the simpler linear form studied by
Mansﬁeld, Sepangi & Eastwood(1997) in the context of determining typical raft proﬁles.
Here, however, we wish to determine whether a maximum raft length, 2Lmax, exists and
if so ﬁnd its value for a raft of given density
. To investigate this, small deformation
theory is inadequate since sinking is an essentially non-linear phenomenon.

That a raft of suﬃciently low density can grow arbitrarily large in horizontal extent
without sinking seems surprising at ﬁrst glance. However, since the raft can incorporate
new material at its neutral buoyancy level without going into compression, this new
material may be added without jeopardising its ability to ﬂoat, and the result seems
almost obvious from a physical viewpoint.

competition between the raft sinking deep into the liquid (to support its weight by
increased hydrostatic pressure) and having its ends a large distance apart (i.e. lower

raft shapes calculated via this model are in good agreement with simple experiments in
which thin strips of stainless steel shim are laid side-by-side at an air–water interface, as
shown in ﬁgure 6 — even when the raft consists of only a small number of strips and we
might not expect the continuum approximation to be valid.

Although this agreement is encouraging, our main interest lies more in whether there is
a maximum length for such a raft to remain aﬂoat, as predicted by the model. Practical
considerations mean it is diﬃcult to produce strips of stainless steel shim narrower than
about 2 mm in the workshop, so the comparisons we are able to draw between our model
and experiments can only be semi-quantitative. In spite of these limitations, we ﬁnd that
for stainless steel strips of length 69 mm and thickness 0.5 mm the maximum raft-length
is 4

5. Discussion

In this article, we have quantiﬁed the conditions under which objects can remain
trapped at a ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface, and shown that when the deformation of the meniscus
is suppressed by the presence of other objects the supporting force that can be generated
decreases dramatically. For two small, parallel cylinders or strips, the maximum force
that can be supported close to contact is only that provided by the contribution from the
exterior meniscus and so suﬃciently dense objects sink upon contact. A two-dimensional
raft of touching, ﬂoating strips may compensate partially for this loss of meniscus by

in the three-dimensional world. Similarly, we have limited ourselves to considering the
equilibrium of objects at an interface. We are currently studying the dynamics of sinking
for the two touching strips of section 3 via a simple hydrodynamic model, which agrees
well with experiments.

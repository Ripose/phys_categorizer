Introduction

Nonpremixed turbulent reacting ﬂows are intrinsically diﬃcult to model due to
the strong coupling between turbulent motions and reaction. The large amount
of heat released by a typical hydrocarbon ﬂame leads to signiﬁcant modiﬁcations
of the thermodynamic variables and the molecular transport coeﬃcients and thus
alters the ﬂuid dynamics [1],[4]. Additionally, in nonpremixed combustion, the
ﬂame has a complex spatial structure. Localized expansions and contractions
occur, enhancing the dilatational motions. Therefore, the compressibility of the
ﬂow and the heat release are intimately related. However, fundamental studies
of the role of compressibility on the scalar mixing and reaction are scarce. In this
paper we present results concerning the fundamental aspects of the interaction
between non-premixed ﬂame and compressible turbulence.

2 Results

In order to assess the inﬂuence of compressibility on the coupling between turbu-
lence and reaction, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying isotropic and
homogeneous sheared turbulence are performed for diﬀerent initial values of the
turbulent Mach number, Mt0, under reacting and nonreacting conditions. The
continuity, momentum, energy and species mass fractions transport equations

are solved using the spectral collocation method. The chemical reaction is mod-
eled as one-step, exothermic, and Arrhenius type. The scalar ﬁelds are initial-
ized with a double-delta PDF (“random blobs”). The range of non-dimensional
mean shear rates considered for homogeneous shear ﬂow cases extends from 4.8
to 22. In this paper the results for S∗ = 7.24, which are in the range dominated
by nonlinear eﬀects, are presented. The reaction parameters mimic the low to
moderate Reynolds number combustion of a typical hydrocarbon in air. Details
about the numerical method as well as the inﬂuence of the reaction parameters
on the ﬂame-turbulence interaction can be found in Livescu, Jaberi & Madnia
[3]. The range of Mach numbers considered in the present study extends from
a nearly incompressible case with Mt0 = 0.1 to Mt0 = 0.6 which is at the upper
limit for the numerical method considered. The decaying isotropic turbulence
simulations have the value of the Taylor Reynolds number Reλ0 = 55 at the time
when the scalar ﬁeld is initialized. For the turbulent shear ﬂow simulations the
range of Reλ0 extends from 21 to 50. In this paper the results corresponding
to Reλ0 = 21 are considered. The results obtained for higher Reλ cases are
consistent with those presented in this paper.

Figure 1(a) shows that for turbulent shear ﬂow cases the peak of the mean
reaction rate decreases its magnitude and occurs at earlier times as the value of
Mt0 is increased. Similar results are obtained for the isotropic turbulence cases,
although the Mt0 inﬂuence on the evolution of the reaction rate is weaker than
in shear ﬂow. In order to better understand this behavior, the reaction rate, w =
Daρ2YAYBexp(−Ze/T ), is decomposed into its components, the mixing term,
G = ρ2YAYB, and the temperature dependent term, F = exp(−Ze/T ) [1]. For
turbulent shear ﬂow, the results presented in ﬁgure 1(b) indicate that the Mach
number has a diﬀerent inﬂuence on the evolutions of F and G. As Mt0 increases
F increases, indicating elevated temperatures. The increase in the temperature
at higher Mt0 can be associated with an enhanced viscous dissipation in the
mean temperature transport equation. Moreover, this eﬀect is more important
for turbulent shear ﬂow where the viscous dissipation levels are higher. For
both ﬂows considered, higher temperatures expedite the ignition and the mean
reaction rate peaks at an earlier time. However, at earlier times the reactants
are less mixed so that the mixing term G has lower values. The combined eﬀects
of F and G terms result in a decrease in the magnitude of the peak of the mean
reaction rate.

The results presented above are consistent with those of Livescu & Madnia
[2] which show that the scalar mixing is more sensitive to changes in Mach
number in homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow than in isotropic turbulence. For
turbulent shear ﬂow, due to the presence of a mean velocity gradient the scalar
ﬁeld develops a preferential spatial orientation. Figure 2(a) shows that the angle
between the direction x1 of the mean velocity, and the scalar gradient projection
on the plane formed by the direction x2 of the shear and x1, has a most probable
distribution approaching values close to ±90◦ after some development time. This
indicates that the scalar blobs are distorted into parallel layers oriented at a small

Due to the spatial structure of the scalar ﬁeld, the relative orientation be-
tween the scalar gradients and diﬀerent quantities pertaining to the velocity ﬁeld
are diﬀerent in turbulent shear ﬂow than in isotropic turbulence. In particular,
Livescu & Madnia [2] show that a passive scalar gradient is no longer aligned
with the most compressive eigenvector of the solenoidal strain rate tensor as in
isotropic turbulence and the relative angle changes with Mach number. As a
result, the production term in the scalar dissipation equation decreases as Mt0
is increased and the mixing becomes worse. Similar results are obtained for a
reacting scalar. However, in this case the heat of reaction aﬀects the turbulence.
Since the reaction takes place mostly at the interface between the scalar layers,
the localized expansions and contractions due to the heat of reaction also develop
a preferential spatial orientation.

For a nonreacting homogeneous shear ﬂow it is known that the explicit di-
latational eﬀects occur predominantly in the direction of the shear [3]. In the
reacting case, due to the anisotropy in the heat release, these eﬀects are further
ampliﬁed. In particular, ﬁgure 2(b) shows that the dilatational kinetic energy
in the direction of the mean shear is increased by the reaction. Moreover, this
increase is more signiﬁcant at higher values of Mt0 .

3 Concluding Remarks

The Mach number eﬀect on the two-way interaction between turbulence and non-
premixed ﬂame is studied in isotropic turbulence and homogeneous turbulent
shear ﬂow using data generated by DNS. The results show that the reaction rate
and its components is less aﬀected by changes in Mt0 in isotropic turbulence

than in turbulent shear ﬂow. For the latter case, the scalar ﬁeld, and thus the
reaction, develops a preferential spatial orientation. As a result, the relative
orientation between the scalar gradients and diﬀerent quantities pertaining to
the velocity ﬁeld is diﬀerent than in isotropic turbulence. This aﬀects the mixing
process and leads to an increased sensitivity to the initial value of the turbulent
Mach number. Moreover, the anisotropy in the explicit dilatational eﬀects is
signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed by the reaction.

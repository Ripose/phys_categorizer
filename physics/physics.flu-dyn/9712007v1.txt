Abstract

Reaction equations of homogeneously mixed pollutants in the atmosphere can lead
to non-stationary periodic solutions. It is important to know in which respect these
solutions are modiﬁed under the inﬂuence of the atmospheric currents. We inves-
tigate this question in a very simple model: The reaction equations are modeled
by the equations of the brusselator and the currents are represented by an isolated
vortex. In the limit of high vortex currents we ﬁnd again the homogeneous solutions
whereas for smaller currents complicated spatial and temporal patterns emerge. The
role of the diﬀusion as a singular perturbation is investigated.

1 INTRODUCTION

The concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere depend on the atmospheric
currents and the reaction equations between the pollutants. (Moreover they
depend on cloud formation, humidity, ice etc, inﬂuences that will not be dis-
cussed here.)

When dealing with this problem the currents are usually replaced by their
average and mixing is modeled by introducing ’turbulent diﬀusion’[1][2][3][4].
The problem of such approximations is that the chemical reactions depend
on the local concentrations and not on averaged ones. A further disadvantage
of this scheme is that the inserted turbulent diﬀusion is orders of magnitudes

higher than the molecular diﬀusion. This is questionable because diﬀusion is
a singular[5][6] and sensitive perturbation as will be shown below.

If the atmospheric currents lead instantaneously to a homogeneous mixing
of the pollutants, all concentrations are obtained from the chemical reaction
equations alone. The solutions of these reaction equations need not approach
a time-independent limit (ﬁxed point for the dynamical system) but periodic
ﬂuctuations are possible as has recently been shown in a model system contain-
ing six pollutants and two pollutant sources[7][8][9]. A particular feature was
the result that pollutant concentrations may change by an order of magnitude
within a few days.

The solutions of the reaction equations become perturbed and then modiﬁed
as soon as the atmospheric currents do not lead to a complete mixing any
more. This situation could be modeled by adding to the reaction equations
the above mentioned averaged currents plus a turbulent diﬀusion term that is
suﬃciently high. But according to the remarks made earlier a more appropri-
ate approach is to assume that the diﬀusion is weak and to incorporate the
transport equations in the reaction equations directly.

The temporal evolution of concentrations of n reactants are described by the
reaction-advection-diﬀusion equations:

∂t

ci = fi(c1..cn, x, t)

v(x, t)

ci + ǫi∆ci,

i = 1, .., n,

(1)

−

· ∇

where the functions fi describe the chemical reactions and pollutant sources.
These functions depend explicitly on the spatial coordinate x if the reactant
i is produced by a localized source. The second term represents the advection
of pollutants by the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) and the last one is the diﬀusion
term. The coeﬃcient ǫ is small and in a ﬁrst approximation we neglect the
diﬀusion. Later on we will investigate the addition of diﬀusion in our model
very carefully.

In general the equations eq.(1) are rather involved. In this paper we choose the
simplest possible system describing nontrivial reactions between constituents
subjected to a simple current which is a solution of Euler’s equation[10]. The
reaction equations are taken from the brusselator[11]. Depending on the pa-
rameters the concentrations converge to a ﬁxed point or limit cycle in the
homogeneous case. Typically periodic solutions with sharp peaks occur. They
are analogous to those obtained in the model of [7] where the chemistry of
tracer constituents in the troposphere were described.

For maintaining the chemical reactions a ’pollutant source’ is required. We
choose a point source pouring out pollutants of sort X placed in the veloc-
ity ﬁeld of a two-dimensional isolated point vortex. The pollutant X decays,

partly into harmless substance E partly into a second constituent Y that au-
tocatalytically reacts with X again according to the well known reactions of
the brusselator

Since molecular diﬀusion does not lead to a spreading on a macroscopic scale
the vortex distributes the pollutants along the circular streamline containing
the point source and thus the model becomes one dimensional. We note that
this advection-reaction problem can be seen as an extension of the simple
brusselator containing it as a limit limiting case for high vortex strengths (or
when the source is close to the vortex center).

Next we discuss the distribution of concentrations on the circle. When the
time T , needed for one circulation is small, the solutions become very similar
to the reaction equations with a homogeneously distributed source. On the
other hand, if T is larger than a threshold value for an observer moving with
the ﬂuid, the distribution becomes periodic with period T , whereas for an
observer at rest the distribution is stationary. When T decreases the distri-
butions become rather diﬀerent: Time dependent solutions with period nT ,
(n = 2, 3...), quasiperiodic and chaotic solutions are detected. All these lead to
time dependent distributions that are inﬁnitely degenerate on the circle and
therefore depend on the initial distribution. Even if that is smooth, steps in
the distributions occur, in the chaotic case on each scale. Therefore diﬀusion
is a singular perturbation and switching it on along the streamline leads to
drastic eﬀects. For the period 2T case, the addition of diﬀusion can be un-
derstood completely. We ﬁnd two time scales. The ﬁrst, which is of the order
of 1 1 leads to coarse graining on the order of √ǫ, the second which is of the
order of eβ/√ǫ, β =
(1) removes all the degeneracies of the solutions leading
to a distribution that is smooth apart from one step. This step is intrinsic and
would appear for a source of ﬁnite size along the streamline as well.

O

For parameters, that without diﬀusion lead to periodic solutions of higher
period we observe pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos. All these so-
lutions have nothing in common with the case of homogeneous mixing we
started with.

In section II we present the model, in section III we discuss its properties
without diﬀusion, in section IV we concentrate on the role of diﬀusion. The
conclusion ends the paper.

2 THE MODEL

The reaction processes, eq.(2), lead to the well known reaction equations,
which in non-dimensional form read as

˙c1 = c2
(1 + b)c1
1c2 −
c2
1c2
˙c2 = bc1 −

(3)

Here c1 and c2 are the concentrations of constituent X and Y respectively.
The parameter b presents the ratio between the decay rate of X into harmless
substances and the decay rate of X into pollutant Y .

Without a source term the concentrations tend to zero. In our model we
assume for simplicity a point like pollutant source that is ﬁxed, but encounters
the ﬂuid ﬁeld of a two-dimensional isolated vortex. This vortex produces a
circular ﬂow with velocity of modulus Γ/r at distance r from the center, Γ
being the strength of the vortex. This problem is one-dimensional since the
chemical reactions can only take place along the circular streamline containing
the source and can be mapped to the unit interval with periodic boundary
conditions. Thus the ﬂow is completely represented by one parameter, the
dimensionless velocity v. We obtain the following combined reaction transport
equations:

Apart from the diﬀusion constant ǫ the equations contain three relevant pa-
rameters, the decay ratio b, the source strength s and the velocity v.

Eq.(4) represent the Eulerian description of an observer at rest. If we change
to the Lagrangian description (i.e. to an observer moving with the ﬂuid) eq.(4)
is transformed into

3 PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL WITHOUT DIFFUSION

First let us discuss the transport reaction equations, eq.(4) and eq.(5) with
diﬀusion switched oﬀ:
For ǫ = 0 the coordinate ¯x can be interpreted as a parameter equivalent to a
time translation ¯x/v in the driving term. Therefore in the moving frame we
have to solve for any ¯x the ordinary diﬀerential equations

The spatial distribution of the concentrations is completely determined by the
solution of the above equation and the initial distribution. Obviously we have
to take into consideration the time shift of the driving for diﬀerent points.

In eq.(6) the diﬀerence to the ’usual’ brusselator is the periodic δ function
time dependence of the source. Thus we have a periodically driven (kicked)
brusselator with one extra parameter, the period of the driving T
1/v.
The periodically driven brusselator has been investigated in diﬀerent contexts
considering a constant plus a sinusoidal or delta function time dependence of
the source [13][14][15]. In the T
0 limit the normal brusselator is recovered,
i. e. very frequent injections correspond to an almost uniform source. In this
b can be divided into two regions (ﬁg.1): For
limit the parameter plane s
values corresponding to higher source strengths the concentrations converge
to the ﬁxed point c∗1 = s, c∗2 = b/s. As s is decreased, the ﬁxed point becomes
unstable and a Hopf bifurcation occurs along the curve s = √b + 1 forming
the boundary between the two regions. Below this curve the system converges
to a limit cycle, i. e. the concentrations oscillate periodically. (ﬁg.2.)

→

−

≡

≪

As the periodic driving is switched on 0 < T
1, a periodic pulsation with
period T of the concentrations appears. Moreover the initially two dimen-
sional phase space becomes three dimensional by including the cyclic variable
t/T mod 1 due to the driving. Thus the dimensionality of the attractor in-
creases as well, and the original ﬁxed point turns to a limit cycle, representing
a periodic time dependence, but still remains a ﬁxed point of the stroboscopic
map. Similarly, the original limit cycle becomes either a torus corresponding
to a quasiperiodic dynamics with one of the periods equal to T (ﬁg.3) or a
periodic orbit with large period. This is expected from the characteristic fea-
tures of periodically driven oscillators. There exist resonant regions for driving

5

frequencies close to their natural frequency multiplied by a rational number.
These resonant regions appear here below the Hopf bifurcation curve. In the
parameter space of these regions Arnold tongues are detected analogous to
those of the so called ’circle map’[16] (ﬁg.4,5). As another eﬀect of the driv-
ing the Hopf bifurcation curve moves to smaller values of s as T increases
(ﬁg.1). Since the dynamics is given by a set of two non-autonomous ordinary
diﬀerential equations chaotic behavior is also possible for some values of the
parameters leading to a strange attractor in the stroboscopic section (ﬁg.6).

Next we consider the distribution of the concentrations due to the properties
of the driven system. Let us discuss the typical cases:
α)periodic time dependence with period T :
This behavior occurs for large T , i.e. as the velocity of the ﬂow becomes small.
In this case the concentrations oscillate and the phase of the oscillations is
determined by the phase of the driving t/T mod 1. Thus the ﬁnal state does
not depend on the initial conditions. In the moving frame the only diﬀerence
in the periodic time dependence at diﬀerent points of the ﬂow is a time lag
¯xT .

c(¯x, t) = c(0, t + ¯xT ).

(7)

vt) we obtain asymptotically
If we move back to the standing frame (¯x
a stationary state c(x, t) = c(0, xT ) i.e. the concentrations converge to a x-
dependent function constant in time.

−

x

β) periodic oscillations with period nT :
This behavior corresponds to the resonant regions. In this case the concentra-
tions can take n diﬀerent values for a given phase of the driving depending on
the initial conditions.

c(0, t + iT + ¯xT )

−

The boundary between the basins of attraction of the n branches of the solu-
tion is a twisted (Mobius-like) surface so that the basin of attraction of branch
i becomes the basin of attraction of branch i + 1 mod n after one period T .
Thus any smooth initial condition must have at least one intersection with this
surface. At this point the concentrations converge to two diﬀerent branches so
a discontinuity appears in the spatial distribution of the concentrations (ﬁg.7).
Note that this step is not a consequence of the delta function in eq.(6) but is
due to geometrical constraints. An initially random distribution can lead to a
completely staggered distribution whose envelopes are the n branches of the
solution. In the moving frame the steps remain at the same position ¯x.

γ) quasiperiodic time-dependence:
This is present in a region below the Hopf bifurcation curve between the

6

resonances and is pronounced for small T because with increasing T the size
of the region below the Hopf curve shrinks and at the same time the resonant
islands grow in size. This case corresponds to a motion on a torus in the phase
space. The dynamics can be characterized by two cyclic angle-like variables,
one of them is the phase of the driving and the other one depends smoothly on
the initial concentrations. c(¯x, t) = c(¯x, t + τ (¯x)) = c(t + τ (¯x) + ¯xT ) Therefore
an initially smooth distribution remains smooth in ¯x for all times (except at
the initial position of the source where the time lag of the driving by T leads
to a discontinuity.)

δ) chaotic time-dependence:
In this case the time dependence is very sensitive to the initial conditions and
thus the distribution becomes irregular on each scale regardless how smooth
the initial distribution may have been (ﬁg.9a).

4 THE ROLE OF DIFFUSION

Without diﬀusion the ﬁnal distributions (except those with the period T ) have
inﬁnite degeneracy due to an arbitrary uneven 2 number of steps. Therefore
diﬀusion is a singular perturbation that has signiﬁcant consequences for the
system as small as ǫ may be. For the following computations we used the
Crank-Nicholson scheme combined with operator splitting [12].

−

+ (+

We discuss here the simplest nontrivial case of eq.(8) ﬁrst, which occurs for
period 2T . We denote with a
) step an ’upward’ (’downward’) steep
−
increase (decrease) of the concentration, but exclude the strong increase of
c1 at the location of the source. If the diﬀusion is small enough we can treat
a step as isolated (for a very long time). Due to diﬀusion the step will move
with a drift velocity, cf (ﬁg.7). Scaling and symmetry arguments suggest that it
should be proportional to a higher power of √ǫ and in fact we ﬁnd numerically
ǫ. The important point, however, is that, averaged over 2T ,
a dependence
each isolated step moves with the same drift velocity. In fact after time T
step and vice versa. What we expect then as the
a
essential ingredient of eq.(8) is that f tries to enforce solutions with period
of 2T . In appendix A we have derived a simple function f that has just this
property and makes it possible to treat eq.(8) analytically. Then we ﬁnd: ﬁrst,

(10)

all other steps are eﬀected. The diﬀusion removes the degeneracies by and by,
until a ﬁnal state emerges that has no steps at all, besides the generic one that
cannot be removed. This state has global stability in our model. Numerically
we ﬁnd the same phenomena for f of the brusselator, cf. ﬁg.7b.

The eﬀects described here occur quite independently from how small ǫ is again
demonstrating that the diﬀusion is a singular perturbation. On the other hand
T2 depends exponentially on 1/√ǫ. When a further perturbation has to be
added acting on a time scale τ we expect quite diﬀerent situations depending
on whether T2 > τ or T2 < τ . This means that the eﬀect of such a pertur-
bation depends sensitively on √ǫ which shows that introducing diﬀusion as a
parameter - as has been done by introducing ’turbulent diﬀusion’ - is quite a
dangerous approximation.

−

We expect even more complicated properties of the concentrations having
higher periods (in absence of diﬀusion). There are two reasons for that: i) if the
period is nT the system has at any location n
1 choices for the height of a step,
ii) the steps are no longer equivalent but are separated in classes and only steps
within the same class change into each other and therefore move with the same
mean drift velocity vd. Indeed, the eﬀect of diﬀusion on the periodic solution
can be very signiﬁcant in some cases by leading to a complicated irregular
behavior of the system in space and time. As can be seen from ﬁg.8, inside
the chaotic concentration ﬁeld coherent regions with regular periodic time
dependence appear and disappear continuously. This kind of spatiotemporal
intermittency has been observed in diﬀerent extended systems[17])[18]) (e.g.
in case of coupled maps[19])[20][21]. If one starts the simulation with a smooth
initial distribution ﬁrst at least the intrinsic step appears as described above.
The pertubation of the periodic solution around the discontinuity leads to a
chaotic time dependence which due to the diﬀusive coupling spreads over the
whole system. Such behavior can be observed for parameters which lie in the
vicinity of the chaotic regimes in the ǫ = 0 case. The solution appears already
for very small ǫ demonstrating again that diﬀusion is a singular perturbation.

In case of quasiperiodic local behavior, instead of a ﬁnite number of discrete
branches, a continuous set of solutions exists ﬁlling the torus in the phase
space. Thus the discontinuity present in the case without diﬀusion is easily
removed by an arbitrarily weak diﬀusion leading to coherent quasiperiodic
oscillations of the whole system.

When the parameters correspond to chaotic local dynamics, diﬀusion tends to

8

form correlated regions of ﬁnite extent in space and time (ﬁg.9) similar to the
case above. As ǫ is increased, the local dynamics becomes completely regular
with a frozen irregular distribution in space which certainly depends on the
initial distribution.

5 Conclusion

High peaks can appear in periodic solutions of chemical reaction equations
in which the constituents are homogeneously mixed tracer gases of the atmo-
sphere. However, depending on the motion of the ﬂuid the mixing need not
be homogeneous at all, and the question arises how these solutions will then
change.

In this paper we investigate this question for a simple model, the brusselator
with pointlike source in a one-vortex ﬂow. Simple as the model appears, it
already demonstrates the strong modiﬁcations occurring as soon as we move
away from the homogeneous situation. One observes this when computing the
concentration distribution along the (closed) streamline in which the source
is located. As a function of time we detect solutions that are very similar
to those of the homogeneous case. This happens as long as the period T of
the ﬂow is small. Furthermore we ﬁnd solutions with period nT , moreover
quasiperiodic and chaotic ones. All these solutions, except that with period
T are inﬁnitely degenerate and therefore depend on the initial distribution.
Even if that is smooth, the distributions can have asymptotically an arbitrary
(uneven) number of discontinuities, in the chaotic case on each scale.

(1) it leads to a ’coarse graining’ of the distribution on a space scale

In such situations diﬀusion is a singular perturbation and switching on arbi-
trary small diﬀusion along the streamline has two eﬀects: First after a time of
√ǫ
∝
O
e√α/√ǫ,
where ǫ is the strength of the diﬀusion. Second on a time scale
α =
(1) it removes all discontinuities but one for solutions which have (with-
out diﬀusion) period 2T . This shows that the solutions depend sensitively on
√ǫ. For parameters that lead (without diﬀusion) to solutions of higher period,
quasiperiodic solutions and chaotic ones were observed, moreover pattern for-
mation and spatio temporal chaos. All those solutions have nothing in common
with the case of homogeneous mixing we started with.

O

∝

Although this one-dimensional model is far from being a realistic represen-
tation of the chemistry and transport in the atmosphere, it shows that even
a trivial non-turbulent ﬂow interacting with a simple regular chemical dy-
namics of just two reactants can lead to a complex irregular behavior of the
concentration ﬁelds.

A appendix

In this appendix we derive the properties of eq.(1) for our model assuming
that without diﬀusion the solution has a 2T period in the moving system. We
have

∂tc = f(c, ¯x, t) + ǫ∂2
¯xc

with the periodic boundary conditions

c(¯x, t) = c(¯x + 1, t)
∂¯xc(¯x, t) = ∂¯xc(¯x + 1, t)

This equation holds true in the frame moving with a velocity v = 1/T .

The use of c can be awkward since the components have to be positive. There-
fore we write

n = c + const

From scaling arguments we infer that eq.(A.25) gives the correct order of
magnitude for √αξd < 1.
One can use eq.(A.24) also to prove that there is no stationary state. If it were
all the equations were exact and in particular eq.(A.24) which in turn would
be a contradiction.

Now we compute the lifetime tl of a step which is in the original coordinates

3) n interacting steps

To treat this problem we take into account the interaction between nearest
neighbors only ( the interaction between next nearest neighbors is exponen-
tially small compared to the interaction between the nearest neighbors). Then
it is suﬃcient to look into the problem of one step between two other steps.
We approximate the interaction again by boundary conditions and obtain two
conditions of the form eq.(A.20). Doing an analogous computation with the
same approximations we obtain for the velocity of the step

2√α(e−

2√αxd+/√ǫ

Here 2xd+ (2xd
) is the distance to the right (left) step. From this result we
conclude that all states with more than one step will be unstable since two
neighboring steps will annihilate each other.

Abstract

We provide evidence that the small-scale statistics of the accelera-
tion of a test particle in high-Reynolds number Lagrangian turbulence
is correctly described by Tsallis statistics with entropic index q = 3
2 .
We present theoretical arguments why Tsallis statistics can naturally
arise in Lagrangian turbulence and why at the smallest scales q = 3
2
is relevant. A generalized Heisenberg-Yaglom formula is derived from
the nonextensive model.

Recently, methods from nonextensive statistical mechanics [1, 2, 3] have
been successfully applied to fully developed turbulent ﬂows [4, 5, 6, 7].
As a driven noneqilibrium system a turbulent ﬂow cannot extremize the
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy — it is obvious that ordinary statistical mechanics
fails to provide a correct description of turbulence. But there is experimental
and theoretical evidence that the statistics of velocity diﬀerences is well de-
scribed if one assumes that the ﬂow extremizes the ‘second best’ information
measures available. These are the Tsallis entropies [1] deﬁned by

q 6= 1 is the entropic index and pi are the probabilities associated with the
microstates of the physical system. The Tsallis entropies, closely related
to (but diﬀerent from) the R´enyi information measures [8, 9], are convex
and distinguished by generalized Khinchin axioms [10]. For q → 1 they
reduce to the ordinary Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Their importance has been
demonstrated in numerous recent papers (see [11] for a detailed listing).

Whereas previous papers on turbulence and Tsallis statistics mainly dealt
with the inertial range [4, 6], in this Letter we will concentrate on the small-
scale characteristics of fully developed turbulent ﬂows. Here one is still far
away from a complete theory, though many empirical facts of the small-scale
statistics are well known and have been experimentally veriﬁed (see e.g. [12]
for a review). Most turbulence measurements have been conducted in the
Eulerian frame, i.e., by measuring the spatial ﬂuctuations of the velocities
using the Taylor hypothesis. Recently, experimental progress has been made
in investigating the Lagrangian properties of fully developed turbulence, by
tracking test particles that are advected by the ﬂow [13, 14]. Examples
of measured histograms of the acceleration of a test particle as measured by
Bodenschatz et al. are shown in Fig. 1. The distribution has been rescaled to
variance 1. The acceleration has been extracted by parabolic ﬁts over 0.75τη,
where τη = (ν/ǫ)
2 is the Kolmogorov time, ν is the kinematic viscosity and
ǫ is the average energy dissipation rate. The ﬁgure also shows as a solid line

which has variance 1. Apparently, the experimental data and the above

distribution function agree quite well. We will now present theoretical argu-
ments why this type of distribution is relevant.

The acceleration a of the Lagrangian test particle is a strongly ﬂuctuating
random variable. It can be regarded as a velocity diﬀerence on a small time
scale τ , i.e. a ≈ (v(t) − v(t + τ ))/τ := u/τ , where τ := κτη is of the order
It is not clear whether the limit τ → 0 exists
of the Kolmogorov time.
in a mathematically rigorous way. For example, already for an ordinary
Brownian particle described by the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process [15], the
velocity exists but the acceleration is singular. Hence it seems to make sense
to statistically describe the movement of the Lagrangian test particle using
a small eﬀective ﬁnite time scale τ . One can now develop the formalism of
nonextensive statistical mechanics for the ﬂuctuating temporal changes in
velocity. Following the ideas of [4] we deﬁne formal energy levels E(u) by
the kinetic energy of the velocity diﬀerences

The multiplication with a time scale τ is necessary for dimensionality reasons,
since ǫ has dimension length2/time3. Extremizing the Tsallis entropies one
obtains the following generalized version of a canonical distribution [4]

For q → 1 the above probability density reduces to the ordinary Boltzmann
factor p(u) ∼ e− 1
. The value of the entropic index q > 1 depends on
the Reynolds number and the scale (see [19] for precision measurements in
Eulerian turbulence). The normalization constant Zq is given by

For q = 3

Gaussian statistics (q = 1) and κ ≈ 1 would imply a0 ≈ 1. On the other hand,
the true turbulent small scale statistics is much better described by q = 3/2,
which yields a0 ≈ 4, in agreement with direct numerical simulations for large
Reynolds numbers [16]. The precise numerical value of a0 also depends on
the ratio κ = τ /τη which enters into the formal thermodynamic description
via eq. (4). Bodenschatz et al. [14] measure distributions with q ≈ 1.5 and
a0 ≈ 5.3 for large Rλ, which corresponds to κ ≈ 0.75. Generally, a measured
Reynolds number dependence of a0 (as presented in [14]) can be translated
into a measurement of the entropic index q in Lagrangian turbulence, by
solving eq. (9) for q.

Let us now argue on theoretical grounds a) why Tsallis statistics can
naturally arise in Lagrangian turbulent ﬂows and b) why the entropic index
is q = 3

2 at the smallest scales.

Generally, Tsallis statistics with q > 1 can arise from ordinary statistical
mechanics (with ordinary Boltzmann factors e−βE(u)) if one assumes that the
formal temperature β−1 is locally ﬂuctuating (see [17] for similar ideas). In
our application to a turbulent ﬂow, β−1 is identiﬁed with the product ǫτ of
local energy dissipation and the typical time scale τ during which energy is
transferred. Both quantities can ﬂuctuate. β−1 is a formal variance param-
eter describing the ﬂuctuating environment of the Lagrangian test particle,
measured relative to the movement of the particle. Using the integral repre-
sention of the gamma function

being the χ2 distribution. The physical interpretation of eq. (13) is that
due to ﬂuctuations of β with probability density f (β) the Boltzmann factor
e−βE(u) of ordinary statistical mechanics has to be replaced by the gener-
alized Boltzmann factor (1 + (q − 1)β0E(u))
q−1 of nonextensive statistical
mechanics. The Tsallis distribution with ﬁxed variance parameter β0 eﬀec-
tively arises by integrating over all possible ﬂuctuating variance parameters
β. This illustrates why the nonextensive formalism can be relevant to non-
equilibrium systems (formally described by a ﬂuctuating β) if there is a
quasi-stationary state in probability space.

The χ2 distribution is well known to occur in many very common cir-
cumstances (see e.g. [18]). For example, if one has n Gaussian random vari-
ables Xi then the sum of the squares of their deviations from their mean
q−1 = n − 1. Or, if T = β−1
χ2 := 1
n
obeys a linear Langevin equation with a constant source term and a damping
that ﬂuctuates stochastically, one also obtains a χ2 distribution for β [17].

The average of β is given by β =

If there are no ﬂuctuations of β at all, as in ordinary statistical mechanics,
eq. (15) just reduces to q = 1, as expected.

In a turbulent ﬂow, the variance parameter β surrounding the Lagrangian
test particle ﬂuctuates, and hence Tsallis statistics can naturally arise in this
context. Since the ﬂuctuations of β become smaller if the volume r3 over
which the energy dissipation is averaged increases, q must be a montonously
decreasing function of the scale r. In fact, at largest scales r one observes
approximately Gaussian behaviour (q ≈ 1), in the inertial range q = 1.1....1.2
gives good ﬁts of the experimental data of Eulerian turbulence [4, 19], and
Fig. 1 indicates that q ≈ 1.5 at the smallest time scales of Lagrangian tur-
bulence.

Let us now provide a theoretical argument why q = 3

2 at the smallest
scales. The observation is that for large |u| the Tsallis distributions (5) (also
called student or t- distributions in the statistics textbooks ) decay as |u|−w,
q−1. Hence only moments h|u|mi with m < w − 1 exist. If q = 3
where w = 2
2
at the smallest scale, this means w = 4 and hence the third moment would
just cease to exist at the smallest scale. If q is precisely 3
2 the third moment
is logarithmically divergent, if q = 3
2 − 0+ it just exists. Since generally the
third moment is the most important moment in turbulence, related to average
energy dissipation, the existence of this moment is necessary for turbulence
to make sense. Since q is monotonically decreasing with scale r, one ends up
with the largest allowed value of q at the smallest possible scale. This is just
q = 3

2 − 0+.
There is further experimental evidence for the above conjecture on the
small scale statistics. In [19] systematic measurements of the exponent w(r)
were performed for Eulerian turbulence (for a turbulent Taylor Couette ﬂow).
The measurements were performed at distances r much larger than the Kol-
mogorov scale η. Over a large range of scales r the measured exponents w(r)
were very well ﬁtted by a power law of the form

w(r) = 4

δ

r
η

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(16)

with δ ≈ 0.3. Extrapolating this down to the Kolmogorov scale η one obtains
w = 4 at r = η, which again supports our hypothesis. Although for very
small r deviations of this power law (pointing towards smaller values of q)
were observed in [19], these deviations can be explained by the disturbing
eﬀects of noise, which naturally shifts the entropic index to lower q values,
since Gaussian white noise implies q = 1.

5

Our conjecture on the small scale statistics is also consistent with a large
amount of other experimental data. In [12] the Reynolds number dependence
of the third and fourth moment of u at the smallest possible scales was
analysed. By averaging the data of many experiments it emerged that the
4th moment increases roughly like ∼ R1/3
λ , whereas the 3rd moment stays
almost constant or increases much less rapidly with Rλ than the 4th moment.
This means that at the smallest scale the 4th moment is expected to diverge
for Rλ → ∞ and the 3rd moment may either just exist or may weakly diverge.
All these experimentally observed features are correctly reproduced by the
Tsallis distribution (5) with q = 3
2.

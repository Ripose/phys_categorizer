General stability criterions of two-dimensional inviscid parallel ﬂow are obtained analytically for
the ﬁrst time. First, a criterion for stability is found as U ′′
1 everywhere in the ﬂow, where
Us is the velocity at inﬂection point, µ2
1 is eigenvalue of Poincar´e’s problem. Second, we also prove a
principle that the ﬂow is stable, if and only if all the disturbances with cr = Us are neutrally stable.
Finally, following this principle, a criterion for instability is found as U ′′
1 everywhere in
the ﬂow. A consequence is that the ﬂow is unstable if there are two infection points in the proﬁle.
These results extend the former theorems obtained by Rayleigh, Tollmien and Fjørtoft and will lead
future works to investigate the mechanism of hydrodynamic instability.

The general stability criterion of inviscid parallel ﬂow
is very important for both theoretic research and appli-
cation. Rayleigh [1] ﬁrst proved the Inﬂection Point The-
orem, which is a necessary criterion for instability. Later,
Tollmien[2] and Lin[3] noted that the phase velocity of an
ampliﬁed disturbance must lie between the minimum and
the maximum values of the mean velocity proﬁle. And
Howard[4] obtained Semicircle Theorem, which contains
Tollmien and Lin’s results. Fjørtoft[5] found another nec-
essary criterion for instability, which is a stronger ver-
sion of Rayleigh’s Theorem. Then there is no remarkable
progress within context of linear stability analysis. These
theorems are well known and can also be found in many
text books[6, 7, 8].

It can be determined by Fjørtoft’s Theorem that the
ﬂow is stable, if U ′′(U − Us) > 0 everywhere in the ﬂow,
where Us is the velocity at infection point. But we don’t
know whether the ﬂow is still stale, if U ′′(U − Us) < 0
somewhere in the ﬂow. The aim of this letter is to ﬁnd
a criterion for these ﬂows. For this purpose, Rayleigh’s
equation for an inviscid parallel ﬂow is employed [6, 7,
8, 9]. For a parallel ﬂow with mean velocity U (y), the
amplitude of the streamfunction eigenfunction φ holds

where c = cr +ici is the complex phase speed and k is the
real wavenumber. The real part of complex phase speed
cr is the wave phase speed and the image part of complex
phase speed ci = ωi/k relates to the grow rate ωi of the
eigenfunction. This equation is to be solved subject to
homogeneous boundary conditions

φ = 0 at y = a, b.

Rayleigh and Fjørtoft proved their theorems by Eq.(3),
which still plays an important role in the following dis-
cussion. To ﬁnd a stronger criterion, we need estimate

The smallest eigenvalue value, namely µ2

Then there is a criterion for stability. The ﬂow is be
U−Us > −µ2

stable, if the velocity proﬁle is subject to U ′′
everywhere in the ﬂow.

To get this criterion, we introduce an auxiliary function
f (y) = U ′′
U−Us , where f (y) is ﬁnite at inﬂection point. We
will prove the criterion by two steps. At ﬁrst, we prove
result 1: if the velocity proﬁle is subject to f (y) > −µ2
1,
then cr can not be Us.

Proof: Otherwise, if cr = Us, this yields to

But the above Eq.(7) can not be hold for some special
Ut. For example, let Ut = 2cr − Us, then there is (U −

which also contradicts Eq.(7). So the second result is also
proved.

From the above two results we ﬁnd a stability criterion.
1 < U ′′
Theorem 1: If the velocity proﬁle satisfy −µ2
U−Us
everywhere in the ﬂow, it is stable. This criterion is
more powerful than Fjørtoft’s Theorem. As known form
Fjørtoft’s theorem, the necessary condition for instabil-
ity is that the base vorticity has a local maximal in the
proﬁle. Noting U ′′/(U − Us) ≈ ξ′′
s /ξs, where ξs is the
vortictiy at inﬂection point, it means the base vorticity
must be convex enough near the local maximum for in-
stability. As shown in Fig.1, there are three vorticity
proﬁles, which have local maximal at y = 0. Proﬁle 2 is
neutrally stable, while proﬁle 1 and proﬁle 3 are stable
and unstable, respectively.

Both Theorem 1 and Fig.1 show that it is the vortic-
ity proﬁle other than the velocity proﬁle that dominates
the stability of the ﬂow. This means that the distribu-
tion of vorticity dominates the shear instability in parallel

inviscid ﬂow, which is of essence for understanding the
role of vorticity in ﬂuid. In fact, we can control the hy-
drodynamic instability just by controlling the vorticity
distribution according these results. This is an very fas-
cinating problem, but can not be discussed here. These
results may shed light on the investigation of vortex dy-
namics.

If the ﬂow is unstable, there are some unstable distur-
bances with positive growth rate. For each wavenumber
k, the fastest growing disturbance is the most important
one. So, what the real phase velocity cr is for the fastest
growing disturbance? Here we will show that the real
phase velocity cr of the fastest growing disturbance is
just the velocity at inﬂection point Us.

Proof: Suppose Us = 0 in Eq.(7), this means Galilean
transform for U , which make no diﬀerence for the follow-
ing discussion. If the ﬂow is unstable, it holds

Otherwise the ﬂow must be stable according to Theorem
1. From Eq.(10), there is

Since Ut is arbitrary, so the left of the inequality is irre-

Obviously, c2

Result 3 is very important for understanding the insta-
bilities of inviscid ﬂows. Since c2
i reach its largest value
at cr = Us, the most unstable disturbances will propa-
gate with phase speed of Us. If all the disturbances with
cr = Us are neutral stable, then the other disturbances
must be neutral stable too. This conclusion is of essence,
and we state it as a principle.

Principle: The ﬂow is stable, if and only if all the dis-

turbances with cr = Us are neutral stable.

By this Principle, Rayleigh’s criterion can be obtained
easily. Since there is no inﬂection point, there is no dis-
turbance with cr = Us according to Howard’s Semicircle
Theorem. Then the ﬂow is stable according to the Princi-
ple, which is what Rayleigh’s Theorem states. Theorem
1 obtained above can also derived from this Principle,
given result 1. The criterion for instability can also de-
rived from this Principle, we state it as a new theorem.
Theorem 2: If the velocity proﬁle is subject to f (y) <
1 everywhere in the ﬂow, the ﬂow is unstable.
We prove this theorem by proving the following result.
Result 4: If the velocity proﬁle is subject to f (y) < −µ2
1
everywhere in the ﬂow, at least one of the disturbance
with cr = Us is unstable.

which contradicts Eq.(13). So the result is proved.

Result 4 shows that if f (y) is less than −µ2

1 everywhere
in the ﬂow, there must be unstable disturbances, so the
mean ﬂow is unstable for this case. This is a reﬁnement of
Tollmien’s [2] and Lin’s [3], who proved the similar result
subject to the velocity proﬁle U (y) is either symmetric
or monotone.

There is at most one inﬂection point in the above dis-
cussion. If there are more than one inﬂection point, can
the ﬂow be still stable? The answer of this question is
a consequence of Theorem 2 and can be stated as a new
result.

Result 5: The ﬂow is unstable, if there are more than

one inﬂection point in the velocity proﬁle.

There are two diﬀerent cases for two inﬂection points.
The ﬁrst case is that the velocities of inﬂection points
are diﬀerent. The second case is that the velocities of
inﬂection points are the same. The proof for the ﬁrst case
is trivial. Here the proof for the second case is given.

Proof: Suppose there are two inﬂection points at c and
d =

d, where a < c < d < b. There is Uc = Ud = U ′′
0 and U (y) can be expressed as

c = U ′′

U (y) =

).

Xm=1

So U ′′/(U − Us) < −π2/(d − c)2 < −µ2
1, the ﬂow is
unstable according to Theorem 2. If there are more than
two inﬂection points in the proﬁle, the ﬂow is unstable
too. So the result is proved.

To show the power of criterions obtained above, we
calculate the growth rate of two similar velocity proﬁles
U1 = sin(1.5y) and U2 = sin(1.6y) with −1 ≤ y ≤ 1.
Then there is µ2
1 = π2/4 for estimation, and the values
of auxiliary functions are −2.25 for U1 and −2.56 for U2,
respectively. So U1 is stable according to Theorem 1 and
U2 is unstable according to Theorem 2, respectively. In
fact, there are three inﬂections in the velocity proﬁle U2.
The growth rate of the proﬁles can be obtained by Cheby-
shev spectral collocation method [9] with 200 collocation
points, as shown in Fig.2. It is obvious that ci = 0 for
U1 and ci > 0 for U2, which agree well with the theorems
obtained above. While Fjørtoft’s criterion can not point
out the diﬀerent stability between the two proﬁles.

On the other hand, Arnold [10, 11] discussed the hy-
drodyanmic stability in a totally diﬀerent way. He in-
vestigated the conservation law of the inviscid ﬂow and
found two nonlinear stability conditions by means of vari-
ational principle.

Apply Arnold’s First Stability Theorem to parallel
ﬂow, a stable criterion is 0 < C1 < (U − Us)/U ′′ <
C2 < ∞ everywhere in the ﬂow, where C1 and C2 are
constants. This corresponds to Fjørtoft’s criterion for
linear stability, and is well known[7]. Here we ﬁnd that
Theorem 1 proved above corresponds to Arnold’s Second
Stability Theorem, i.e., a stable criterion is 0 < C1 <
−(U − Us)/U ′′ < C2 < ∞ everywhere in the ﬂow. So
It is very interesting that the linear stability criterions
match nonlinear stability theorems very well.

One may note that the criterions of diﬀerent theo-
rems are diﬀerent from each others, U ′′(U − Us) for
Fjørtoft’s, (U − Us)/U ′′ for Arnold’s and U ′′/(U − Us) for
present works. But this make no diﬀerence for Fjørtoft’s
and Arnold’s criterions in the coarse cases, for example
U ′′(U − Us) > 0 is same as (U − Us)/U ′′ > 0. Since the
constants C1 and C2 in Arnold’s criterions lack eﬃciency
estimation for applications, they are not widely used as
the linear criterions (eg. Rayleigh’s criterion) be.

Besides, Theorem 2 above is a more powerful criterion
for instability, which is not obtained by nonlinear theory

yet. Since the criterion for stability and the criterion for
instability are very close, the marginal of instability is
limited in a very small zone. In fact, it may be noted that
the eigenfunction for µ2
1 in Poincar´e’s problem should

These two criterions extend the criterions and results
proved above. This will lead future works to understand
the mechanism of instability.

An interesting question is which one would be the
marginal criterion, U ′′(U −Us) or U ′′/(U −Us)? It can be
seen from Eq.(1) that the stability of proﬁle U (y) is not
only Galilean invariance of U (y), but also magnitude free
of U (y) due to linearity. Since the value of U ′′(U − Us)
is only Galilean invariance not magnitude free, it can
not be the the marginal criterion. While the value of

4

U ′′/(U − Us) satisﬁes both conditions, this is the reason
why the criterions in above theorems are the functions of
U ′′/(U − Us).

In summery, the general stability and instability crite-
rions are obtained for inviscid parallel ﬂow. Those results
extend the former theorems proved by Rayleigh, Tollmien
and Fjørtoft. The criterions highlight the vorticity pro-
ﬁle for understanding the instability of the parallel in-
viscid ﬂow. According to the criterions, the marginal of
instability is limited in a very small zone. The criteri-
ons for stability of parallel inviscid ﬂow can be applied
to barotropic geophysical ﬂow, like Kuo did [12]. This
extension is trivial for the cases of f -plane and β-plane,
and is omitted here. In general, these criterions will lead
future works to investigate the mechanism of hydrody-
namic instability, and shed light on the ﬂow control and
investigation of the vortex dynamics.

The work was original from author’s dream of under-
standing the mechanism of instability in the year 2000,
when the author was a graduated student and learned
the course of hydrodynamics stability by Prof. Yin X-Y
at USTC. The work is purely due to personal interesting,
and it does not supported by any oﬃcial founds.

On the origin of non-Gaussian statistics in hydrodynamic turbulence

Turbulent ﬂows are notoriously diﬃcult to describe and understand based on ﬁrst principles. One
reason is that turbulence contains highly intermittent bursts of vorticity and strain-rate with highly
non-Gaussian statistics. Quantitatively, intermittency is manifested in highly elongated tails in the
probability density functions of the velocity increments between pairs of points. A long-standing
open issue has been to predict the origins of intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics from the
Navier-Stokes equations. Here we derive, from the Navier-Stokes equations, a simple nonlinear
dynamical system for the Lagrangian evolution of longitudinal and transverse velocity increments.
From this system we are able to show that the ubiquitous non-Gaussian tails in turbulence have their
origin in the inherent self-ampliﬁcation of longitudinal velocity increments, and cross ampliﬁcation
of the transverse velocity increments.

Intermittency in turbulent ﬂows refers to the vio-
lent and extreme bursts of vorticity and rates of strain
that occur interspersed within regions of relatively quiet
ﬂow[1]. These infrequent, but extreme events are be-
lieved to cause observed deviations from the classical
Kolmogorov theory of turbulence[2]. Intermittency also
has a number of practical consequences since it can lead
to sudden emergence of strong vortices in geophysical
ﬂows[3], to modiﬁcations of the local propagation speed
of turbulent ﬂames [4], etc. One of the observable man-
ifestations of intermittency is the tendency of velocity
increments, i.e. the diﬀerence between velocities at two
spatial points separated by a distance ℓ, to display highly
non-Gaussian statistics when ℓ is smaller than the ﬂow
integral scale, L. The tails of velocity-increment prob-
ability density functions (pdf) are observed to be ex-
ponential and even stretched exponential[1, 3]. More-
over, an inherent asymmetry develops in the distribution
of the longitudinal velocity increments, i.e.
the diﬀer-
ence of the velocity component in the direction of the
displacement between the two points. This asymmetry
yields the well-known negative skewness of longitudinal
velocity increments[1]. While the negativity of skewness
can be derived from the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations in
isotropic turbulence[1, 2], a straightforward mechanistic
explanation of the origins of stretched exponential tails,
intermittency, and asymmetry has remained elusive.

In one dimension for the Burgers equation, the emer-
gence of negative skewness and long negative tail in the
pdf starting from random initial conditions is well under-
stood based on the nonlinear term’s tendency to steepen
the velocity gradient. In 3D turbulent ﬂows, the notion
of nonlinear “self-ampliﬁcation” as the cause of intermit-
tency has long been suspected[5]. Yet, these expectations
have eluded quantitative analysis due to the diﬃculty in
deriving lower-dimensional models that maintain the rel-
evant information about the vectorial nature of the full
3D dynamics. Many surrogate models have been pro-
posed, such as shell models [6], the mapping closure[7, 8],

etc, but the connection with the original N-S equations
is typically based on qualitative and dimensional resem-
blances instead of on systematic derivation.

We consider the coarse-grained N-S equations ﬁltered
at scale ∆ comparable (and larger) than the scale ℓ. Let
ui be the ﬁltered velocity ﬁeld. Deﬁning the velocity
gradient tensor Aji = ∂ui/∂xj and taking the gradient
of the ﬁltered N-S equations one obtains[9, 10] that the
rate of change of the velocity gradient is given by

˙Aji = −

where Q = −AmnAnm/2 arises from continuity. The
tensor Hji contains the trace-free part of the pressure
Hessian, subgrid, and viscous force gradients[11, 12]:
Hji = −(∂2
kkAji,
in which p is the ﬁltered pressure divided by density and
ν the viscosity. τij = uiuj − uiuj is the subgrid-scale
(SGS) stress. The time derivative ˙( ) is a Lagrangian
material derivative deﬁned as the rate of change of the
gradient tensor following the local smoothed ﬂow. Set-
ting Hij = 0 yields the so-called “Restricted Euler”
dynamics[9, 10]. A fruitful method to model the eﬀects
of Hij has been to track material deformations using ei-
ther tetrad dynamics[13] or the Cauchy-Green tensor[14].
Here we focus on a simpler object - a line element, aiming
at identifying the mechanism generating intermittency.
Thus, consider two points separated by a displacement
vector r of length smaller than, or of the order of, ∆
so that the local velocity ﬁeld is smooth enough to be
approximated as a linear ﬁeld. The velocity increment
between the two points over the displacement r is then
δui(r, t) ≡ ui(x + r) − ui(x) ≈ Aki rk.

(2)

The longitudinal and transverse velocity increments,
δu(r, t) and δv(r, t) respectively, can be evaluated from
the two projections of velocity increment Eq. 2 into di-
rections longitudinal and transverse to r (see FIG. 1):

δu(r, t) = Aki rk

δv(r, t) =

where Pij (r) = δij − rirj /r2 and r = |r|.

Note that δu(r, t) and δv(r, t) correspond to velocity
increments over a displacement ri(t) that is evolving, in
a local linear ﬂow, according to equation ˙ri = Ami rm.
To study the evolution of velocity increments at a ﬁxed
scale ℓ, it is necessary to eliminate eﬀects from the chang-
ing distance between the two points. Consider a line
that goes through the two points. Still within the as-
sumption of a locally linear velocity ﬁeld, the velocity
increments across a ﬁxed distance ℓ along this line are
δu ≡ δu(r, t)ℓ/r, δv ≡ δv(r, t)ℓ/r (see FIG. 1).

FIG. 1: Illustrative sketch of velocity increment δui(r) be-
tween two points x(t) and x(t) + r(t), and the components of
δui(r) longitudinal and transverse to the displacement vector
r. The quantities of interest are δu and δv, deﬁned as the
components of the velocity increment over a ﬁxed length ℓ.

Taking time derivatives of δu and δv, and using the
expressions for ˙Aji and ˙ri, many terms simplify and one
arrives at the following “advected delta-vee” system of
equations:

δ ˙u = −δu2 ℓ−1 + δv2 ℓ−1 −

Qℓ + Y,

δ ˙v = −2 δu δv ℓ−1 + Z,

(4)

(5)

where Y = ℓHijrirj /r2 and Z = ℓHijejri/r contain the
anisotropic nonlocal eﬀects of the pressure, inter-scale
eﬀects of subgrid-scale stresses, and damping eﬀects of
molecular viscosity (e is a unit vector in the direction of
the transverse velocity component). The ﬁrst term on the
right-hand-side (rhs) of the equation for δ ˙u also occurs in
1D Burgers equation (the self-ampliﬁcation eﬀect of neg-
ative velocity gradients). The second term indicates that
the transverse velocity (rotation) tends to counteract the
self-ampliﬁcation process. For δ ˙v, the ﬁrst term on rhs
of Eq. 5 suggests exponential growth of δv at a rate |δu|
when δu < 0. This “cross-ampliﬁcation” mechanism can
lead to very large values of |δv|.

We now pose the question whether the growth of in-
termittency and the asymmetry of longitudinal velocity
increments can be understood based on this system of
equations, but without the eﬀects represented by Y and
Z (i.e., “Restricted Euler” dynamics).
In order to de-
termine whether this simpliﬁed system approximates δ ˙u

2

and δ ˙v in real turbulence, comparisons are made with
direct numerical simulations (DNS). The rates of change
of δu and δv predicted by DNS are obtained by ﬁnite
diﬀerence in time from two DNS velocity ﬁelds sepa-
rated by the simulation time-step δt = 0.001. The
data are obtained from a pseudo-spectral simulation of
the N-S equations, with 2563 nodes and Taylor-scale
Reynolds number Rλ ≈ 162. The velocity ﬁelds are
coarse-grained using a Gaussian ﬁlter of characteristic
length ∆ = 40η, where η is the Kolmogorov length scale,
yielding ﬁltered velocity ﬁelds ui(x, t0) and ui(x, t0 + δt)
(i = 1, 2, 3). At the initial time t0, to every grid-point
x(t0) on the computational mesh, we associate a part-
ner x(t0) + r(t0) at a distance |r(t0)| = ℓ = 40η in
some Cartesian direction. For each pair of points we
measure the longitudinal and transverse velocity incre-
ments. Then, we ﬁnd the position to which x(t0) and
x(t0) + r(t0) will be advected by the smoothed velocity
ﬁeld, which are, using simple Euler integration, x(t0 +
δt) = x(t0) + u(x, t0)δt, and x(t0 + δt) + r(t0 + δt), where
r(t0 + δt) = r(t0) + [u(x(t0) + r(t0), t0) − u(x(t0), t0)]δt
is the new displacement vector. The ﬁnal end-point at a
ﬁxed distance ℓ is found by moving the material end-point
x(t0 + δt) + r(t0 + δt) along the new displacement vector
to the point x(t0 +δt)+r(t0 +δt)ℓ/|r(t0 +δt)|, so that the
distance is kept ﬁxed. Velocities at the new locations are
obtained from the stored ﬁeld at the new time using bi-
linear interpolation, and the longitudinal and transverse
components are evaluated, by projections onto direction
parallel and perpendicular to the new displacement vec-
tor between the two points. The rate of change of δu
and δv is evaluated using ﬁrst-order ﬁnite diﬀerence in
time. Conversely, the rates of change predicted by the
model system are evaluated as −δu2/ℓ + δv2/ℓ − (2/3)Qℓ
and −2 δu δv/ℓ from the measured values of δu, δv and
Q. Both real and modeled rates of change are computed
over a large number of points in the DNS data, and their
correlation coeﬃcient and joint pdf are evaluated.

FIG. 2: Joint pdf of rates of change of velocity increments pre-
dicted from DNS (ﬁltered at ∆ = 40η and taking increments
over a distance ℓ = 40η) and the “advected delta-vee” sys-
tem. (a) longitudinal and (b) transverse velocity increments.
Results are robust with changes in ∆ and ℓ (with ℓ ≤ ∆).

FIG. 2 shows the joint pdf of the model results versus
the rates of change measured from DNS. A clear correla-

tion can be seen between model and DNS results. Corre-
lation coeﬃcients are 0.54 for the longitudinal and 0.61
for the transverse velocity increments, indicating that the
model system captures important (but clearly not all) ef-
fects seen in the real dynamics. The deviations between
model system and DNS are caused by the neglected Y
and Z terms, to be studied in future work.

After conﬁrming that the simpliﬁed system captures
important trends in 3D ﬂuid turbulence, we explore the
trends predicted by solutions of the model system. In the
present Letter we set Q to a constant Q0 (numerical tests
show that allowing Q to evolve in time leads to the same
short-time behavior to be displayed below, except if Q
were to be closely correlated with δu and δv, which is not
the case in 3D turbulence, since Q depends on velocity
gradients along two additional directions[17].). We note
that for Q = 0, the system describes the relative motion
of a ﬂuid (with a locally linear velocity ﬁeld) consisting of
non-interacting (“ballistic”) particles that maintain their
initial velocity. For Q 6= 0, the particles are subjected
to a relative force equal to the spherical average of the
pressure, inter-scale, and viscous damping forces. For the
case Q0 = 0 the analytical solution is

δu(t) = ℓe0[e0t + δu0ℓ]/{[e0t + δu0ℓ]2 + δv2
δv(t) = ℓ2δv0e0/{[e0t + δu0ℓ]2 + δv2

where e0 = δu2
0. For discrete values of time, this
deﬁnes a mapping (the “advected delta-vee map”). The
system has an invariant

U0 = (δu2 + δv2)/δv,

(8)

and its (circular) phase-space trajectories are δu2 + (δv −
U0/2)2 = (U0/2)2, as shown in FIG. 3.

FIG. 3: Phase-space portrait of the “advected delta-vee” dy-
namical system δ ˙u = −δu2 + δv2, δ ˙v = −2 δu δv (for Q0 = 0
and ℓ = 1).

In order to illustrate the evolution of δu(t) and δv(t),
we start from an ensemble of randomly oriented lines for
which the velocity increment vectors are initialized from
a Gaussian distribution. The increments δu(t) and δv(t)
over these lines are evaluated at several later times. To
compare with experimental data, two issues need to be
considered. First, since δv(t) is the magnitude of the

3

transverse velocity increment vector, it has to be pro-
jected onto a coordinate direction to obtain a component
of the transverse increment, δvc = δv cos θ. For isotropic
turbulence, the angle θ between the vector and a ﬁxed
direction in the transverse plane is uniformly distributed
in [0, 2π). Therefore, the pdf P c
v (δvc) of δvc is related to
that of δv, Pv(δv), by

P c

v (δvc) =

Second, an ensemble of randomly oriented lines (with
uniform measure on a sphere, i.e. a uniform distribu-
tion of initial solid angles dΩ0) will tend to concentrate
along directions of positive elongation. Thus, in order to
compare model results at later times with data that are
taken at random directions not correlated with the dy-
namics, the model results need to be weighted with the
evolving solid angle measure. Conservation of ﬂuid vol-
ume implies that ℓ3dΩ0 = r(t)3dΩ(t), i.e.
in directions
of growing r(t), the solid angle dΩ(t) decreases. Thus,
probabilities must be weighted by

dΩ(t)/dΩ0 = [ℓ/r(t)]3.

(10)

Since ˙r = δu r/ℓ, we can solve for r(t) and then obtain
t
dΩ(t)/dΩ0 = exp(−3ℓ−1
0 δu(t′)dt′). Using the solution
0t2]−3/2
for δu, we obtain dΩ(t)/dΩ0 = ℓ3[(ℓ + δu0t)2 + δv2
R
for Q0 = 0. This factor is used to weight the measured
time-evolving pdfs from the model system. Note that
when δv0 → 0 and δu0 < 0, there is an unphysical ﬁnite
time singularity at t → ℓ/|δu0|, when r → 0.

FIG. 4 shows the evolution of the pdfs of the longitu-
dinal and transverse velocity increments (both the mag-
nitude and a component), as time progresses (for the
case Q0 = 0). It is immediately clear that the two main
qualitative trends observed in turbulence naturally evolve
from the solution of the system: the skewness towards
negative values of longitudinal velocity increment, and
the noticeable ﬂare-up of long tails in the pdfs of trans-
verse velocity increment. Also, these features appear
rather quickly: after a non-dimensional time t/τ = 0.18
the pdf is already highly skewed and displays stretched
exponential tails. Very similar results are observed for
nonzero values of Q0 (using numerical forward time inte-
gration with a standard fourth order Runge-Kutta rou-
tine, we tested Q0 = ±2): Relative to the results for
Q0 = 0, the pdfs of δu are shifted to the left for Q0 > 0
and to the right for Q0 < 0, and only very minor diﬀer-
ences are seen for δv. The rapid appearance of stretched
exponential tails is due to the divergence of the phase-
space trajectories on the left half of the plane in FIG. 3.
For a given initial kinetic energy δu2
0, if δv0 is small,
the invariant U0 can be arbitrarily large. Thus δu and δv
can later grow to very large values during the evolution.
In summary, the model system proves useful in show-
ing that the emergence of ubiquitous trends of 3D tur-
bulence, namely intermittent and asymmetric tails in

FIG. 4: Evolution of the pdf of velocity increments in time:
(a) longitudinal velocity increment, (b) the magnitude and
(c) a component of the transverse velocity increment vector.
δu is initialized as a standard Gaussian random number and
δv as the square root of the sum of the square of two inde-
pendent Gaussian random numbers.
(c) is calculated from
(b) by numerical integration of Eq. (9). For simplicity, we set
ℓ = 1, so that the characteristic time-scale of the ensemble
is τ = ℓ/δu0|rms = 1. Dotted line in (a) and (c): Gaussian;
solid: t = 0.03; dashed: t = 0.06; dash-dotted: t = 0.09;
dash-double-dotted: t = 0.12; long-dashed: t = 0.15; long-
dash-dotted:
t = 0.18; and thin line with squares in (c):
t = 0.18 without correcting for evolving measure.

pdfs of velocity increments, occur even in the “ballis-
tic” case (Q0 = 0). Considering all possible random ini-
tial directions of relative motion, the fraction of particle
pairs that initially move towards each other is small, thus
large gradients in small spatial regions occur rather in-
frequently but are very intense when they occur due to
the self-ampliﬁcation mechanism for δu, and the cross-
ampliﬁcation mechanism for δv. While the model system
thus helps explain the origin and trends towards inter-

4

mittency in 3D turbulence, predicting quantitatively the
level of intermittency remains an open question. It re-
quires understanding the eﬀects of pressure, inter-scale
interactions (that depends on interactions of vorticity
and strains at various scales, see e.g. [15, 16]) and viscos-
ity that are neglected in the model system. But already,
the proposed model system could be combined with cas-
cade, mapping closure, or shell models to enable these
heuristic approaches to include a more direct link to the
underlying Navier-Stokes equations.

ing measure during the pdf evolution. We gratefully ac-

[17] In 2D turbulence, to which the model can also be applied,
the term −2Qℓ/3 must be replaced with −ℓ det(A). It
can be shown that one of the two terms of the determi-
nant exactly cancels the term −δu2 in the equation for
δu. This cancels the mechanism for growth of negative
skewness and intermittency in 2D. In 3D there is no full
cancellation due to the weaker correlations among the
diﬀerent directions. More detailed results for the 2D case
will be reported elsewhere.

The signature of laminar instabilities in the zone of transition to turbulence

(Dated: February 17, 2014)

It has been shown recently [1] that there exists a connection between laminar instability and the
pattern of birth of turbulent spots in a laminar boundary layer. In the present study we demonstrate
that the space-time statistics of spot birth can be reconstructed qualitatively from the average
behaviour of certain macroscopic measures in the transition zone. We examine why the relationship
between instability and transition to turbulence is manifest in some cases and appears to be totally
absent in others. The versatility of cellular automaton simulations is exploited to study the eﬀect
of geometry, and to assess the validity of the hypothesis of concentrated breakdown, according to
which most turbulent spots originate at a particular streamwise location. The predictions made
lend themselves to straightforward experimental veriﬁcation.

INTRODUCTION

The transition to turbulence in open ﬂows is a process
that usually occurs in a sequence of events. In this pa-
per we focus on one stage in the sequence, namely, the
breakdown into turbulent spots of the unstable laminar
ﬂow. Among the various common open ﬂows: jets, wakes,
shear layers etc., the most well-studied is the boundary
layer formed by the ﬂow past a solid body. Even here, the
physics behind the stage mentioned above is not under-
stood. The transition process is described in some detail
in [2], but a brief outline is given here for completeness,
a schematic picture is given in ﬁgure 1.

FIG. 1: Sequence of events in the laminar-turbulent transition
process, on a boundary layer formed by the ﬂow past a semi-
inﬁnite plate.

The process begins with receptivity, in which a lami-
nar ﬂow internalises disturbances from the free-stream
or from the surface roughness. These disturbances de-
cay at ﬁrst, but beyond a certain local Reynolds number,
disturbances lying within a particular narrow range of
frequencies begin to grow. This stage can be described
by linear hydrodynamic stability theory and has been ex-
tensively studied for two-dimensional ﬂows. Once these
disturbances have grown to a certain amplitude, they are
able to destabilize three-dimensional secondary modes,

giving rise to Λ shaped structures [3, 4, 5]. Further down-
stream, in the transition zone, the ﬂow breaks down into
occasional turbulent spots, or concentrated patches of
turbulence surrounded by quiet laminar ﬂow. The spots
grow both in the streamwise and spanwise directions as
they convect downstream with the ﬂow, in this process
they often merge with neighbouring spots, until the ﬂow
asymptotically becomes fully turbulent. The ﬂow is thus
intermittently turbulent in the transition zone, with an
intermittency parameter γ, deﬁned as the mean fraction
of the time the ﬂow is turbulent, going from 0 at the
beginning of the transition zone to 1 far downstream.
All these stages co-exist in the same ﬂow because the
Reynolds number, deﬁned here as R ≡ U∞δ/ν, where
U∞ is the local free stream velocity, ν is the kinematic
viscosity and δ is a length scale related to the boundary
layer thickness, increases with downstream distance.
We deﬁne the freestream turbulence level q as

1/2

q ≡

ˆui ˆui
3U 2

(cid:18)

∞ (cid:19)

(1)

where ˆui are the components of velocity perturbations in
the freestream, so q is a measure of how noisy the ex-
ternal ﬂow is. The above route to turbulence is usually
observed when the background disturbances in the ﬂow
are low, i.e., q ∼ 0.005 or less. At higher noise levels, lin-
ear combinations of several exponentially decaying modes
can give rise to substantial levels of transient (algebraic)
growth of disturbances [6, 7], this is referred to as the
“bypass” route to turbulence. If the temporary growth
of disturbance kinetic energy is high enough, nonlinear
mechanisms can take over at ﬁnite time, and drive the
ﬂow to turbulence [8, 9, 10, 11]. The predominant struc-
tures seen are streamwise-aligned low and high speed
streaks, which can go unstable to three-dimensional dis-
turbances as shown in ﬁgure 2. Subsequently, transition
to turbulence appears to progress in a manner similar to
that observed in the low external noise case.

We refer to the secondary instability of Tollmien-
Schlichting modes as T2 (ﬁgure 2), and to the secondary
destabilisation of the streamwise streaks as S2. Both S2

2

stability pattern T2 at low q is obtained from a secondary
instability analysis, while the pattern S2 is obtained from
available literature.

The hypothesis of concentrated breakdown, according
to which all spots are born at a particular streamwise
location [14], was assumed to hold in [1]. We show in
section VI that this is a reasonable assumption. Cellular
automaton simulations enable us to study the transition
zone under diﬀerent conditions, the eﬀect of geometry is
demonstrated to be signiﬁcant in the boundary layers on
cylinders in section VII.

A pattern in turbulent patches, along the lines of
present predictions for boundary layers, was observed
in the experiments of Prigent et al.
[15] in plane Cou-
ette ﬂow and Taylor-Couette ﬂow. They obtained lo-
calised turbulent patches in the form of spirals and spots
which form a ﬁnite-wavelength pattern. They found that
this spatial modulation of turbulent intensity obeys the
dynamics of coupled amplitude (Ginzburg-Landau type)
equations with noise.

Before going into the simulations, we ﬁrst describe the
method adopted to obtain the modes of secondary insta-
bility (section II), and discuss the transition zone and its
characteristics in section III.

II. ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY INSTABILITY

The growth of the small perturbations in a boundary
layer is described by linear hydrodynamic stability the-
ory. Two-dimensional disturbances go unstable ﬁrst in
these ﬂows [16]. In normal-mode form, the disturbance
may be written as

ˆv(x, y, t) = v(y) exp[ı(kx − ωt)],

(2)

where x and y are the streamwise and wall-normal coor-
dinates respectively, t is time, k is the streamwise wave
number and ω is the complex wave frequency.
Includ-
ing this form of disturbance in the Navier-Stokes and
continuity equations, eliminating pressure and stream-
wise velocity and linearising, we get the celebrated Orr-
Sommerfeld equation [17, 18]

(U −ω/k)(v′′ −k2v)−U ′′v =

(viv −2k2v′′ +k4v) (3)

1
ıkR

where U (y) is the mean velocity non-dimensionaliased by
U∞, and the primes denote diﬀerentiation with respect
to y. The boundary conditions are, v = v′ = 0 at the
wall, and v, v′ → 0 as y → ∞.

Above some Reynolds number, disturbances satisfying
(3), whose frequencies lie within a certain small range,
begin to grow, this is here referred to as the ‘primary’,
or Tollmien-Schlichting mode of instability. The growth
rate, given by the imaginary part of ω in equation (2), is
usually small compared to the real part of ω, so the dis-
turbance may be approximated as being periodic. When
the primary disturbances have grown to a signiﬁcant am-
plitude (of the order of a percent of the mean ﬂow), the

and T2 display a locally regular pattern of maxima in
disturbance vorticity, which may be aligned (harmonic)
or staggered (subharmonic). Up to this stage in the tran-
sition process, we can obtain analytically and/ or numer-
ically the predominant structures and all other properties
of the ﬂow. It is beyond this stage, i.e., when the ﬁrst tur-
bulent spots appear, that much less is understood. The
space-time distribution of spot birth in a natural tran-
sition boundary layer is diﬃcult to measure directly. It
is relatively straightforward, however, to measure transi-
tion zone quantities such as the intermittency, the burst
rate and the persistence time distribution of laminar or
turbulent ﬂow as functions of the streamwise distance.
The burst rate B is here deﬁned as the mean number of
switches from laminar to turbulent ﬂow per unit time at
a given location, and the persistence time W of laminar
ﬂow is the duration of time for which the ﬂow remains
continuously laminar at a given location. The transi-
tional intermittency has been measured in many experi-
ments, but there are no data available for the other mea-
sures, as far as we know. Direct numerical simulations
[12] have been conducted for one or two spots and their
immediate vicinity, but a simulation which can produce
statistics of spot birth and propagation is beyond the
reach of present-day computers. Our main objective in
this paper is to show, with the help of cellular automaton
simulations, that it is possible to reconstruct the statis-
tics of the birth of turbulent spots from the downstream
variation of the quantities mentioned above. It is hoped
that the present predictions will motivate experimental
eﬀorts.

In [1] it was suggested that the pattern of disturbance
highs and lows in the secondary instability stage must
correlate with the pattern of turbulent spots in the transi-
tion zone. It was shown that if spots are made to be born
in the same space-time pattern locally as made by the sec-
ondary instability S2, we obtain an intermittency varia-
tion from cellular automaton simulations which compares
very well with that measured in a high-q experiment [13].
The comparison of T2 simulations with experiments at
low q is very good so long as the ﬂow is highly deceler-
ating. For a constant external ﬂow, the observed inter-
mittency variation seems to ﬁt better with a completely
random birth of turbulent spots. The reasons for this
counter-intuitive behaviour are discussed in V. The in-

periodic ﬂow becomes unstable to secondary, typically
three-dimensional, disturbances. The linearised equa-
tions describing the secondary instability are obtained
by writing ﬂow quantities in the form [19, 20],

U(x, y, t) =

The quantity in the curly brackets is the periodic basic
ﬂow consisting of the laminar proﬁle plus the primary
instability wave. Here A stands for the amplitude of the
primary disturbance. The secondary disturbance is writ-
ten as

us(y, r⊥, t) = Re

where r⊥ ≡ x~i + z~k and k± ≡ k±~i ± β~k. We substitute
the above ansatz into the Navier-Stokes and continuity
equations, retain linear terms in the secondary, and elimi-
nate the disturbance pressure and streamwise component
of the velocity. On averaging over x, z and t, only the
resonant modes survive, which are related as follows:

k+ + k− = k,

and

(ω+ + ω−)r = ω.

are Chebyshev collocation points. The idea is to trans-
form the computational domain from (−1, 1) to (0, y∞),
where y∞ is chosen to be at least 5 times the boundary
layer thickness, and to cluster grid points close to the wall
by tuning the parameter b. On changing the number of
grid points Ng from 80 to 160, the eigenvalues remained
identical up to the sixth decimal place. Results for the
boundary layer over a ﬂat-plate compare very well with
those of [19].

We are interested here in the ﬂow past ﬂat solid sur-
faces inclined at an angle β ≡ 2m/(m + 1) to the ﬂow. In
this case, the external ﬂow velocity varies downstream
as U∞ ∼ xm [22]. For a ﬂat plate aligned with the
ﬂow, m = 0, we refer to this as a constant pressure
boundary layer. An adverse pressure gradient (deceler-
ating) boundary layer corresponds to negative values of
m. We make comparisons in this paper between con-
stant pressure and decelerating boundary layers, since
the behaviour in the transition zone diﬀers in the two.

number and primary disturbance amplitude. The sub-
harmonic mode, of wavenumber (= k+ = k−) = k/2 is
found always to be the most unstable.

III. THE TRANSITION ZONE

At a streamwise location where the disturbance ampli-
tude reaches a requisite ﬁnite value, turbulent spots begin
to be born. This is deﬁned as the location xt of transi-
tion onset. Downstream, the ﬂow proceeds towards tur-
bulence as described above. Narasimha [14] made the hy-
pothesis of concentrated breakdown, according to which
most turbulent spots originate within a narrow spanwise
strip around xt. (In section VI we discuss the validity
of this hypothesis.) The transition zone is easiest to de-
scribe quantitatively in terms of the variation with the
streamwise coordinate, x of the intermittency, γ. With
spots appearing randomly in accordance with a Poisson
distribution in time and a uniform distribution in the
spanwise coordinate z, γ would vary downstream as [14]

F ≡

− log(1 − γ) =

(14)

such that the intermittency parameter F varies linearly
in x. Here U is the free stream velocity, n is the number of
spots forming per unit length in the spanwise direction, z,
per unit time, at xt. The shape and downstream growth
of turbulent spots is experimentally observed to be sim-
ilar in all pressure gradients: a turbulent spot maintains
an arrowhead shape when viewed from above, and re-
mains self-similar as it grows [24, 25]. It is convenient
therefore to deﬁne a non-dimensional spot propagation
parameter as

σ =

1
Ur

(cid:20)

− 1

Uh (cid:21)

U tan ζ,

(15)

where ζ is the angle subtended by the spot at its origin
and Uh and Ur respectively are the speeds with which its
head and rear convect.

The burst rate may be expected to have a maximum
somewhere in the middle of the transition zone. For a
Poisson process, it is related to the local intermittency
by

B ∝ (1 − γ) (− ln(1 − γ))

1/2

.

(16)

The probability density function of persistence time W
of laminar ﬂow for a Poisson process can be written in
the form

p(W + 1) ∝ (1 − γ)W (− ln(1 − γ)) .

(17)

At low q, the parameter F in Eq. 14 in constant pres-
sure ﬂow varies almost perfectly linearly with x, but its
variation in decelerating ﬂows is nonlinear with an in-
creasing slope, as seen in ﬁgures 3 and 4 respectively.
The increase in slope has been termed a “sub-transition”

4

[26]. When q is high, the variation is nonlinear even in
a constant pressure ﬂow. No results for decelerating ﬂow
at high q are available to us. The explanation [1] for the
nonlinear behaviour of intermittency is that spot birth is
not random, but in accordance with secondary instabil-
ity.

IV. STOCHASTIC SIMULATIONS

Stochastic simulations of the transition zone (using
a cellular automaton-like approach) are performed, em-
ploying observed properties of spot growth and convec-
tion, details are available in [1]. We consider two sce-
narios for spot birth. The ﬁrst is a random breakdown,
[24], where spots appear
as suggested hitherto, see e.g.
in accordance with a Poisson distribution in time and a
uniform distribution in z, with no relation to instability.
The second is predominantly regular breakdown, where

the pattern prescribed is as dictated by secondary insta-
bility, i.e. either harmonic or subharmonic T2 or S2, as
described below. The transition zones for random and
regular (harmonic) breakdown are shown schematically
ﬁgures 5 and 6 respectively.

The zone, as viewed from above, is discretized into
200 × 400 rectangular grids in x and z. Each grid is
assigned an integer χ, equal to 0 if the ﬂow there is
laminar and 1 if it is turbulent. A regular breakdown
scenario is prescribed as follows. During the ﬁrst time
interval, one spot is generated every Nz sites, at X = 1
and Z = lNz + i, l = 0, 1, 2 · · · Lz/Nz, where i is an
integer between 1 and Nz. The uppercase stands for
discretised coordinates. After Nt time steps the spots
form at spanwise locations which are staggered in the
spanwise coordinate with respect to the spots generated
earlier, i.e., at X = 1 and Z = lNz + j for harmonic
and Z = (l + 1/2)Nz + j for subharmonic breakdown
where j = i + 1. This prescription corresponds to spots
forming at the crests of an oblique wave of spanwise and
streamwise wavenumbers

β =

2π
Nz∆Z

and

k =

(18)

2π
Nt∆T v

respectively, where v is the streamwise velocity of the
wave crest. The phase of the oblique wave is randomised
with a small probability (1%), and a small fraction (5%)
of the spots are generated randomly. It is assumed that
this prescription mimics qualitatively the randomisation
due to external disturbance. Changes in these fractions
do not change the answers signiﬁcantly.

In a random breakdown, spots appear at X = 1 in ac-
cordance with a Poisson distribution in time and a uni-
form distribution in the spanwise direction. In each case,
the downstream growth of turbulent spots follows the
same algorithm. During one time interval, the front of
each spot moves ahead by 2 grid locations, while the rear
moves forward by 1 grid location. The lateral dimen-
sion of the spot is increased by 1 grid location on either
side. The simulated spot is thus triangular, and retains
its shape for all time. A real spot is a little blunter at its
leading edge than a triangle, but this is assumed not to
change the results signiﬁcantly.

In experiments, the speed of the front of the spot is
comparable to the ﬂow velocity U while the rear moves
forward approximately at 0.5U . The half-angle ζ sub-
tended by the spot at its origin is about 10◦ in a constant
pressure boundary layer, and increases with adverse pres-
sure gradient.

In Figs. 7 and 8 it is demonstrated that intermit-
tency behaviour is sensitive to the ratio of spanwise to
streamwise wavenumbers. This observation is used to
strengthen the connection we make between instability
and its signature in the transition zone. The simulations
shown in Fig. 7 display a distinct change in slope at
X = 13, just downstream of the location (X = 11) at
which the heads of a set of spots formed at a time T
just touch the rears of the spots formed at T − Nt∆T .

FIG. 5: Schematic diagram of the simulation domain in a
random spot breakdown scenario. Spots appear according to
a Poisson distribution in time, and are uniformly distributed
in the spanwise direction.

FIG. 6: Schematic diagram of the simulation domain in reg-
ular breakdown. Spots are formed at regular intervals in the
spanwise direction and are staggered after every time period,
in a manner dictated by the secondary instability.

In the simulations of Fig. 8, all parameters have been
kept the same, except that the values of Nz and Nt have
been switched. In this case the spots touch each other
laterally ﬁrst (at X = 6) downstream of which a sharp
change in slope is again evident. At low F , i.e., up-
stream of spot merger, the intermittency behaviour in
each case is exactly the same as that when spots form
randomly (with the same breakdown rate). This is not
surprising, given that the spots are too small to “see”
each other. At higher intermittencies, quite surprisingly,
for the same mean breakdown rate and identical spot
growth, the length of the transition zone is seen to be
very diﬀerent, which tells us that spot-merger plays a
large role in transition. A purely lateral merger results
in a much higher degree of overlap (on both sides), and
consequently, less of the region is occupied by spots. This
of course means that transition to turbulence will pro-
ceed much more slowly as shown in Fig. 8. A purely
longitudinal merger on the other hand, results in far less

spot overlap, meaning more occupancy by spots, and a
shortened transition zone (Fig. 7). The latter scenario,
of increasing slope, is more consistent with experimental
observations.

We now ask which kind of merger scenario would be
consistent with growing instability modes. To do this,
we perform a secondary instability analysis to obtain
the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers for which the
secondary wave grows fastest. For example, for an ad-
verse pressure gradient ﬂow of Falkner-Skan parameter
m = −0.06, the maximum growth rate (ωi) of the sec-
ondary instability wave is 0.067, and occurs when the
wavenumbers (k and β) are 0.165 and 0.215 respectively.
The corresponding phase speed is 0.524U∞. Using the
fact that the rear of a spot travels at approximately half
the freestream velocity, we have tan ζ = 2∆Z/U∞∆T .

The spot propagation angle is taken as ≈ 20o, which is
close to the experimental value for this pressure gradient
[29], and from equation (18) we may estimate the break-
down ratio Nz/Nt to be ∼ 4.9. The analysis is done at
a Reynolds number of 220, based on the boundary layer
momentum thickness, to match the experimental value
[28]. Incidentally, this ratio may be taken to be indepen-
dent of Reynolds number, since it changes only by 2% for
a 50% change in Reynolds at this pressure gradient.

Figure 9 shows the intermittency variation obtained
from the stochastic simulations, with Nz = 49 and
Nt = 10. The streamwise distance η is scaled to match
the streamwise locations of γ = 25% and γ = 75% with
experiment.
(We have checked that simulations with
other combinations of Nz and Nt which maintain the
ratio, e.g., 98 and 20, change only the eﬀective size of
the grid, and not the answers.) In ﬁgure 10 we consider
a slightly lower adverse pressure gradient, m = −0.05.
The ratio Nz/Nt obtained from stability analysis for this
case is 3.23, and in the stochastic simulations we use
Nz = 39 and Nt = 12. The results of both simulations
are in good agreement with experiments. In particular,
the change in slope of the intermittency parameter F (x)
is followed well, as seen in ﬁgure 11. From these and other
comparisons (not shown), we may conclude that a spot
breakdown pattern as prescribed by the secondary insta-
bility gives rise to intermittency behaviour in qualitative
agreement with low q measurements in highly decelerat-
ing ﬂows.

It may be noticed that there is some discrepancy at the
beginning and the end of the transition zone, where it is
known that experimental data may be inaccurate: errors
could arise unless the data is collected over extremely
long times. Secondly, a short laminar patch within a
turbulent signal at γ close to 1 is often diﬃcult to dis-

tinguish experimentally. Similarly at γ close to 0 tiny
patches of turbulence can be diﬃcult to distinguish from
noise. It is also to be remembered that the hypothesis
of concentrated breakdown is an idealisation: in reality
spots would be forming within a narrow streamwise strip
around x = xt, rather than at one particular location,
this can smear out the intermittency at γ ∼ 0.

When the freestream turbulence level q is high, break-
down is triggered by a bypass mechanism. Intermittency
data for such a situation are available in [13], for which
the ratio Nz/Nt is estimated from [8] to be about 5.
Figure 12 shows that simulations with this ratio com-
pare very well with experimental measurements [13] at a
freestream turbulence of q = 0.015.

The burst rates obtained from the present simulations
with a random breakdown are checked against equation
16 in ﬁgure 13, the relationship is followed well. Any
deviation from this behaviour is a sign that spot break-
down is not random. When the breakdown is mostly reg-

ular, it is clear that the burst rate distribution is more
“peaky” and symmetric with respect to γ = 0.5. The
burst rate variation with intermittency is similar for sub-
harmonic and harmonic type breakdowns. We suggest
here that there is a need for experimental measures of
these quantities, especially in adverse pressure gradient
boundary layers, which will help us quantify the break-
down scenario. The burst rate behaviour displayed when
the dominant merger is lateral is qualitatively diﬀerent
from the case where the merger is longitudinal. The burst
rates obtained from the simulations whose intermitten-
cies are shown in ﬁgure 8 and 7, are plotted in ﬁgure 14,
and are a demonstration of this.

where the intermittency is γ = 0.1 and 0.5. For a ran-
dom spot breakdown, the probability density of the per-
sistence time decays exponentially with persistence time,
as is expected from equation (17). At low intermittency
levels, in the case of regular breakdown, an overall decay
is signiﬁcantly modulated by ups and downs. At higher
levels of intermittency, if the breakdown is predominantly
regular, the probability of very large waiting times is ex-
tremely low, as expected. The most probable persistence
times correspond to the modulated streamwise extent of
the laminar zone between two rows of spots. In the case
of subharmonic (staggered) spot arrangement, there is
a probability of skipping one row of spots, giving larger
persistence times. This is seen as an additional ”step” in
the probability density function. In ﬁgure 16 the prob-
ability density function of the persistence time from a
simulation where the lateral merger is dominant is plot-
ted. The qualitative behaviour is diﬀerent, and therefore
an experimental measurement of p(W ) is likely to indi-
cate the dominant breakdown pattern.

IS SPOT BIRTH RANDOM IN CONSTANT

PRESSURE GRADIENT FLOWS?

laminar ﬂow at (a) γ = 0.1, and (b) γ = 0.5. Dashed line:
random breakdown, solid line: 90% regular (sub-harmonic
T2), long dashes: 50% regular.

The probability density function of the persistence
time W , deﬁned here as the extent of time that the ﬂow
continuously remains laminar, is plotted in ﬁgure 15. The
data is obtained by running the simulation over 20 million
time steps (after reaching stationary state), monitoring a
particular streamwise location in the middle of the span
and collecting statistics of lengths of strings of zeroes be-
tween two 1’s. We present results for W at locations

We have seen in constant pressure (ﬂat plate boundary
layer) ﬂow that the intermittency parameter F is linear in
x, consistent with random spot-birth. Do the secondary
instabilities not directly trigger spot birth here? A par-
tial answer may be gleaned from 17, where the spanwise/
streamwise ratio of wavelengths of the dominant mode is
shown as a function of the pressure gradient. The ratio
decreases with decreasing pressure gradient, and Nz/Nt
is about 2.3 for a constant pressure boundary layer (since
now k = 0.085, β = 0.146 and v = 0.353 for the most
dangerous mode). If the breakdown were to be regular,
with this ratio, simulations show that the variation in F
is linear up to about γ = 0.75, while at high values of in-
termittency, the slope increases, as seen in ﬁgure 18. On

the lines of the discussion on Fig. 7, we may expect that
spot mergers are now a combination of lateral and lon-
gitudinal, with longitudinal being marginally dominant.
The weakened dominance means that the slope change
occurs much closer to full turbulence, at γ ∼ 0.8.

The obliqueness of the most unstable wave provides
only a partial answer for why the variation of F is linear
in a constant pressure boundary layer. The perfectly
linear ﬁt in a vast number of experimental data is also
likely to be because the degree of randomness in this case
is actually higher than in an adverse pressure gradient
boundary layer, as suggested by Gostelow and Walker
[31]. The following qualitative arguments indicate why
we may expect this.

A decelerating ﬂow is inherently much more unstable
[32, 33], as demonstrated in ﬁgures 19 and 20. Since the
primary wave is slowly growing, we assume that the sec-

noted that the growth of the secondary mode can be
faster than exponential if the primary mode is unsta-
ble as well. Within a very short downstream distance,
the disturbance waves in an adverse pressure gradient
ﬂow achieve the threshold amplitude required for break-
ing down into spots. In the constant pressure case the
attainment of the required threshold is much slower, of-
fering greater opportunity for stochastic eﬀects.

could be another cause for randomness in zero pressure
gradient ﬂow. Amplitude modulation would result in dif-
ferent waves reaching the threshold at diﬀerent stream-
wise stations, and spot birth would be smeared out over a
streamwise distance. In the case of decelerating ﬂow, the
group velocities of the waves are much larger, as seen in
Table I, and the amplitude modulation takes place over
a much narrower width. At a Reynolds number of 200,
the group velocity cg of the most unstable secondary in
adverse pressure gradient is more than twice the corre-
sponding wave over a ﬂat plate. At a Reynolds number
of 600, this ratio is more than 3. The phase speeds on
the other hand are not that diﬀerent.

Finally, the wavelength ratio of the dominant mode
varies signiﬁcantly with primary disturbance amplitude
in ﬂat-plate ﬂow (see [34]). This, however, is not the
case in strongly decelerating ﬂow, as seen in Table II.
If the external noise is irregular in amplitude, a greater
randomisation would take place in ﬂat plate ﬂow than in
decelerating ﬂow.

These results indicate that in a decelerating bound-
ary layer, formed by the ﬂow past an inclined plate, the
connection between instability and transition is likely to
be much easier to observe, and we therefore recommend
experimental work in adverse pressure gradient, rather
than on ﬂat plate boundary layers.

VI. EFFECT OF CONCENTRATED
BREAKDOWN

Narasimha [14] proposed the hypothesis of concen-
trated breakdown in which all spots form within a nar-
row spanwise belt around the location of transition onset,
i.e., within xt ± ǫ, where ǫ << x. While the intermit-
tency behaviour resulting from the hypothesis and the
assumption of a random breakdown matches experiment
very well in constant pressure and low disturbance envi-
ronments, its validity has been a matter for debate, see
[35]. Since a particular disturbance amplitude is
e.g.

achieved at a particular Reynolds number, it is plausible
at least that upstream of a given x location, no spots
will form. A large number of spots are likely to form in
the vicinity of xt, but given that instability modes which
are not dominant could continue to grow in the transi-
tion zone, a small number could be born at any location
downstream. We conduct simulations to estimate how
much the intermittency and other parameters depend on
making this hypothesis. We do this by allowing an in-
creasing fraction of the spots to form with equal proba-
bility anywhere downstream of xt. A random breakdown
is prescribed. Our conclusion is that even in the unlikely
event of a large fraction of spots being born downstream,
the intermittency is dominated by spots forming at xt,
since at any given x, these spots are much larger than
those born more recently.

The intermittency distributions for the extreme cases
tried are shown in ﬁgure 21. It is seen that even when
80% spots form downstream of the onset location, the
variation of F is still practically linear. However when
all the spots are born downstream of xt (as modelled
by Emmons [36]), there is a noticeable departure from
linearity. In an instability-driven transition, it is highly
likely, as discussed above, that a signiﬁcant fraction of
spots will be born around xt. It may be noticed that the
intermittency behaviour in the case of Emmons break-
down does not appear very diﬀerent qualitatively from a
regular breakdown, and would thus be diﬃcult to distin-
guish in an experiment. However, an experiment which
measures persistence times can distinguish very simply
between them, as is evident from ﬁgure 22. In an Em-
mons breakdown, the persistence time distribution de-
cays exponentially, but with a smaller slope than for the
concentrated breakdown, as expected.

spots in the transition zone of an axisymmetric bound-
ary layer. The downstream variation of the intermittency
parameter F is shown in ﬁgure 23. The quantity c is the
circumference of the body.
In the initial region, tran-
sition proceeds exactly as it would in two-dimensional
ﬂow. This is because spots are too small to “see” the
body. When spots wrap themselves around the cylin-
der, a qualitative change is observed, as is expected from
the discussion above, and transition proceeds much more
slowly after this. The burst rate B shown in ﬁgure 24
is another indication of the diﬀerences in the transition
process.

spite of wide application in the motion of submarines,
ﬁshes etc. When the transverse curvature is signiﬁ-
cant, transition can proceed quite diﬀerently from a two-
dimensional boundary layer [37]. When the typical patch
of turbulence, consisting either of a single spot or a group
of spots which have merged laterally, attains a width of
the order of the diameter of the cylinder, it wraps it-
self around the body. Downstream of the location of
wrap, further lateral growth is not possible. The turbu-
lent patch then resembles a sleeve [38] displaying only a
one-dimensional growth in the streamwise direction.

We have carried out stochastic simulations of the birth
and downstream propagation and growth of turbulent

VIII. SUMMARY

Stochastic

simulations,

inspired by a

cellular-
automaton approach, of the generation and propagation
of turbulent spots in transitional boundary layers have
been conducted, employing the observation that spot
growth is self-similar. It is demonstrated that the pattern
of spot birth may be inferred from the downstream vari-
ation of average quantities in the transition zone, such
as the intermittency and the burst rate. This is because
the qualitative behaviour in the transition zone depends
on whether there is a pattern in spot merger, and if so,
whether lateral or longitudinal merger is dominant. Con-
trary to present belief, our results indicate that relatively
simple experiments can tell us a great deal about the
connection between instability and transition to turbu-
lence. We show that experiments conducted in deceler-
ating ﬂows are much more conducive to exploring this
connection than constant pressure ﬂows. Transverse cur-

vature has the eﬀect of slowing down the transition pro-
cess.

Non-linear equations of radial motion of a gas bubble in a compressible viscous liquid have been
modiﬁed considering eﬀects of viscosity and compressibility more complete than all previous works.
A new set of equations has been derived including new terms resulted from consideration of the
viscosity and compressibility not only at the bubble interface, but also in the bulk of liquid. The
new equations are two non-linear coupled equations, which can not be merged into one equation
unlike all previously derived equations. Numerical calculations have been performed considering
eﬀects of heat and mass transfer at the bubble interface. The results indicate that the new terms
exhibit an important damping role at the collapse, so that their consideration dramatically weakens
the bubble rebounds after the collapse. Dependence of this new damping mechanism to amplitude
and frequency of the deriving pressure has been investigated.

INTRODUCTION

When a small isolated gas bubble, immersed in a liq-
uid, experiences a high amplitude spherical sound ﬁeld,
it grows and contracts non-linearly. Description of the
dynamics of such non-linear motion is an old challeng-
ing problem. The complexities of the problem arise from
the eﬀects of heat conduction, mass diﬀusion, compress-
ibility, viscosity, and energy losses involved in damped
oscillations of the bubble. So far, many people have in-
vestigated this problem, each concentrating on diﬀerent
aspects of its complexities. However, a rather complete
description has not been presented yet.

Lord Rayleigh [1] was the ﬁrst who analytically solved
the collapse of an empty bubble in an incompressible liq-
uid. Plesset [2] subsequently studied the dynamics of
a vapor-ﬁlled bubble in a time-dependent pressure ﬁeld.
Noltingk and Neppiras [3] were the ﬁrst people derived
a diﬀerential equation for the gas bubble motion under
the inﬂuence of such pressure ﬁeld. The extension of
this equation to the bubble motion in a compressible
liquid has been studied by many authors; Herring [4],
Trilling [5], Gilmore [6], Keller and Kolodner [7], Hick-
ling and Plesset [8], Jahsman [9], Flynn [10], Lastman
and Wentzell [11], Keller and Miksis [12]. On the other
hand, heat conduction eﬀects were presented in the works
of Hickling [13], Fujikawa and Akumatsu [14], and Yasui
[15]. In addition, the works of L¨ofstedt et al. [16], Nig-
matulin et al. [17], and Brujan [18] are of the subsequent
papers addressing this problem.

Between all previous works, the most complete descrip-
tion of the bubble dynamics equations was presented
by Prosperetti and Lezzi [19]. They used a singular-
perturbation method of the bubble-wall Mach number

and derived the following one-parameter family of equa-
tions describing the bubble motion in the ﬁrst order ap-
proximation of compressibility [19]:

where, R, C, P∞, and ρ are the bubble radius,
liq-
uid sound speed, liquid pressure at inﬁnity, and liquid
density, respectively. Also, η is an arbitrary parameter.
Equation (1) must be supplemented by a boundary con-
dition equation at the bubble interface to relate the liquid
pressure, Pl, to the gas pressure inside the bubble. Like
all previous authors, Prosperetti and Lezzi [19] used the
following incompressible equation for this purpose:

Pl = Pg − 4µ

˙R

where, Pg, µ, and σ are the gas pressure at the bubble in-
terface, liquid viscosity, and surface tension, respectively.
Most of the previously derived equations belong to this
single parameter family of equations, corresponding to
diﬀerent values of η. Moreover, η = 0 yields results in
closest agreement with the numerical simulation of full
partial diﬀerential equations [19].

Two speciﬁc approximations have been used in the
derivation of Eq’ns. (1) and (2). The ﬁrst approxima-
tion is the negligence of the viscosity eﬀects for the liquid
motion around the bubble, which has been used in the
derivation of Eq’n.
(1) has been
derived from the Euler equation, in which the viscosity
is eliminated. Note that the viscous term of Eq’n. (2)
has been resulted from the liquid viscosity at the bubble
interface, but not from the bulk of liquid.

In fact, Eq’n.

(1).

The second approximation is the incompressibility as-
sumption of the liquid and the gas at the bubble inter-
face, which has been used in the derivation of Eq’n. (2).
All of the eﬀects of the liquid compressibility in the work
of Prosperetti and Lezzi, as well as in all other previous
works, have been resulted from the liquid motion around
the bubble, but not from the bubble boundary condi-
tion equation. In fact, all previous authors, on one hand
took into account the compressibility of the liquid mo-
tion around the bubble, but on the other hand neglected
its consideration at the bubble interface.

Although, the two mentioned approximations have
been used in the derivations of the existing bubble dy-
namics equations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], but the applicability of these ap-
proximations for all times of the bubble motion needs to
be clariﬁed. Especially, at the end of the collapse, when
the bubble motion is signiﬁcantly compressible, these ap-
proximations may be inapplicable.

In this paper, by eliminating the above mentioned ap-
proximations, we have originally modiﬁed the bubble dy-
namics equations. A new set of equations have been de-
rived including all eﬀects of the viscosity and compress-
ibility of both the liquid and the gas. These equations
contain new terms resulted from the eﬀects of two coef-
ﬁcients of viscosity of both the liquid and the gas. The
inﬂuence of the added new terms arisen from the liquid
viscosity has been numerically investigated. The results
clearly indicate that the addition of the new terms con-
siderably aﬀects the bubble motion at the collapse time
and during the bubble rebounds.

II. DERIVATION OF THE BUBBLE DYNAMICS
EQUATIONS

To derive the bubble dynamics equations, we assume
that the motion of the bubble interface and the inﬁnitely
extended surrounding liquid are always spherically sym-
metric. Under this circumstance, the continuity and the
momentum equations are as follows [20]:

where, ρ, u, p, and ∆ are density, velocity, pressure, and
divergence of the velocity, respectively. Also, µ and λ
are ﬁrst and second coeﬃcients of viscosity. The two

Dividing Eq’n. (5) by ρ and integrating it with respect to

are constant, we get:

where, ∆l and ∆∞ are the divergence of the liquid veloc-

The liquid pressure at the far ﬁeld, P∞, is:

P∞(t) = P0 + Pa(t),

(8)

where, P0 and Pa(t) are ambient and driving pressures,
respectively. From Eq’n. (3) the divergence of the veloc-
ity can be written as:

(10)

The viscous term in Eq’n. (10) has been resulted from
the simultaneous eﬀects of the liquid viscosity and com-
pressibility. This term has been neglected in the derived
equations of the previous authors.

To convert Eq’n. (10) to a diﬀerential equation, the
integral term must be approximated. Because of the irro-
tationality assumption of the bubble motion the velocity
potential, ϕ(r, t), can be introduced into this equation as:

ϕt(R, t) =

˙R2

where subscript t denotes the temporal derivation. In the
simplest approximation of ϕt(R, t), the liquid motion is
assumed to be incompressible. So, the liquid velocity at
any distance r will be:

(11)

(12)

u(r) =

According to this approximation, ϕt(R, t) can be written
as:

Inserting Eq’n. (13) into Eq’n. (11) and eliminating the
liquid viscous term due to incompressibility approxima-
tion yields the well-known Rayleigh-Plesset equation:

= R ¨R + 2 ˙R2.

(14)

To introduced the compressibility eﬀects into approx-
imation of ϕt(R, t), we assume that the liquid potential
fulﬁlls the following acoustic equation for the spherical
waves:

(rϕ) + C

(rϕ) = 0.

(15)

As we have shown in the following, this approximation is
equivalent to the ﬁrst order compressibility consideration
of Ref.
[19]. Double radial diﬀerentiation of Eq’n. (15)
results:

(r△) + C

(r△) = 0.

(16)

Through the deﬁnition of total derivative of the velocity
along with Eq’n. (3) it can be obtained that:

This equation is the modiﬁed form of Flynn equation [10]
along with viscosity consideration.

The compressibility eﬀects can be introduced in a dif-
ferent manner. Diﬀerentiating Eq’n. (15) with respect to
t and substituting ϕt(R, t) in it from Eq’n. (11) yields:

in which, the spatial and the temporal partial derivatives
of the viscous term have been neglected due to smallness
as well as the spatial derivative of the liquid pressure
at inﬁnity. Inserting the relation dρ = dp/c2 into Eq’n.
(3) and using this equation and the momentum equation
along with the total derivatives of the pressure and the
velocity at the bubble interface, the four partial deriva-
tives in Eq’n. (21) can be obtained as:

Note, in the derivation of the Eq’ns. (22-25), the spa-

cous terms in the Navier-Stokes equation, Eq’n. (4), have
been neglected. Inserting Eq’ns. (22-25) into Eq’n. (21)

It is straight forward to obtain the modiﬁed form of
Eq’n. (1) by the addition of Eq’n. (26) and the product

The new Eq’n. (27) provides a suitable description of
the simultaneous eﬀects of liquid compressibility and liq-

pressibility.

the dimensionless variables into Eq’ns. (27) and (32), the

The new Eq’n (31) provides the most complete boundary

tains all eﬀects of compressibility and viscosity of both
the liquid and the gas. Here, we concentrate on the eﬀects
of liquid viscous new term of Eq’n (31) and eliminate the
gas viscosity terms as previous works [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

present the most complete form of the bubble dynamics
equations containing eﬀects of the liquid compressibility
and viscosity not only at the bubble interface, but also
in the bulk of liquid. In fact, these equations account for
the viscosity of a compressible liquid. While, all previous
equations accounted for the viscosity of an incompress-
ible liquid and compressibility, separately.

III. BUBBLE INTERIOR EVOLUTION

To quantify eﬀects of the new viscous terms on the bub-
ble dynamics, evolution of the gas pressure at the bubble
interface, Pg, must be speciﬁed.
It can be determined
from simultaneous solution of the conservation equations
for the bubble interior and the bubble radius equations
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Also, heat conduction and mass
exchange between the bubble and the surrounding liquid
aﬀect the bubble evolution. These complexities were con-
sidered in a complete gas dynamics simulation by Storey
and Szeri [29].

On the other hand, strong spatial inhomogeneities in-
side the bubble are not remarkably revealed, unless at the
end of an intense collapse [26, 27]. Therefore, the uni-
formity assumption for the bubble interior seems to be
useful and provides many features of the bubble motion
[21, 22]. Using this assumption Toegel et al. presented an
ODE model [30], in which eﬀects of heat and mass trans-
fer at the bubble interface have been considered. This
model accurately describes various experimental phase
diagrams [31] and provides a good agreement with the
complete direct numerical simulation of Storey and Szeri
[29].

In this paper, we used the Toegel et al.’s model [30]
for specifying the bubble interior evolution. We describe
an argon bubble in water under the conditions of Sin-
gle Bubble Sonoluminescence [21, 22]. The gas evolution
model can be summarized as follows.

The gas pressure is modeled by the van der Waals equa-

tion of state:

Pg =

NtotkT
V − NtotB

(36)

where, Ntot = NAr + NH2O is total number of parti-
cles inside the bubble. The covolume constant B =
5.1 × 10−29 m3 is assumed to be equal for both water
vapor and argon [31]. The value of Ntot changes with
time because of evaporation and condensation of the wa-
ter vapor molecules at the bubble interface. The rate of
change can be modeled as [30]:

˙Ntot = 4πR2D

(37)

where, nH2 O and n0H2 O are the instantaneous and equi-
librium concentration of the water vapor molecules, re-
spectively. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D, is given by [32]:
D = D0(n0/ntot), where D0 = 23.55 × 10−6 m2/s and
n0 = 2.5 × 1025 m−3. The quantity ld is thickness
of diﬀusive boundary layer (see Ref.
[30] for more de-
tails). The equilibrium concentration of the water va-
por molecules is given by the number density of the
saturated vapor pressure at the ambient liquid temper-
ature T0; n0H2 O = Pν (T0)/kT0.
In our calculations:
n0H2O = 5.9 × 1023 m−3.

Similar to Eq’n. (37), the heat exchange at the bubble

interface can be approximate by [30]:

10−3 W/mK [32] is thermal conductivity coeﬃcient of
the gas content, lth is thickness of thermal boundary layer
and χ is thermal diﬀusivity coeﬃcient, which is given by:
χ = κ/cp, with cp = ( 5
2 nH2O)k the constant pres-
sure heat capacity per unit volume of the gas.

where, three diﬀerent values for θi correspond to char-
acteristic vibration temperatures of H2O: θ1 = 2295K,
θ2 = 5255K, and θ3 = 5400K [31]. In this paper for sim-
plicity we neglected the eﬀects of chemical reactions [31],
which are important only at an extremely short time in-
terval when the bubble temperature is high enough (more
than 5000K).

Equations (36-40) along with the bubble dynamics
equations are the set of equations, which totally de-
scribe the evolution of the bubble characteristics. Under

these circumstances, time variations of the bubble prop-
erties have been numerically calculated for both the new
(Eq’ns. 34,35) and the old (Eq’ns. 1,2) bubble dynamics
equations (for η = 0).

IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

The calculations were carried out for a periodic driving
pressure; Pa(t) = Pa sin (ωt), with ω = 2π × 26.5 kHz.
The constants and parameters of the bubble dynam-
ics equations were set for the water at room temper-
ature, T0 = 293.15 K, and atmospheric ambient pres-
sure, P0 = 1.0 atm; ρ = 998.0 kg/m3, C = 1483.0 m/s,
µ = 1.01 × 10−3 kg/ms, σ = 0.0707 kgs−2 [34]. The sec-
ond coeﬃcient of viscosity of water at room temperature
was set to be λ = 3.43 × 10−3 kg/ms [35].

Figures (1-3) illustrate the results of our calculations
for Pa = 1.4 atm and R0 = 4.0 µm. Similar values for
these parameters have been reported in recent experi-

FIG. 2: Time variations of the number of H2O particles inside
the bubble according to the new (solid) and the old (dashed)
sets of equations. Graphs (a) and (b) show the evolution in
a complete period and during the bubble rebounds, respec-
tively. The parameters and constants are the same as Fig.
(1).

constants as Fig. (1).

mental works of Ketterling and Apfel [36], Simon et al.
[37], and Vazquez et al. [38]. Figure (1) shows the varia-
tions of the bubble radius for the new and the old bubble
dynamics equations. It is observed that the addition of
the new viscous terms considerably changes the bubble
evolution after the collapse. The bubble motion is re-
markably compressible during the collapse. Therefore,
the new viscous terms, which have been arisen from the
liquid compressibility, are important in this time interval.
These terms exhibit a damping role and their considera-
tion reduces the amplitude of the bubble rebounds. Also,
the period of the rebounds decreases with the addition of
the new terms. Details of our calculations at the end of
the collapse show that the minimum radius for the new
case is about 4% greater than that of the old one.

The diﬀerence between the two cases for the evolution
of the number of H2O particles has been illustrated in
Fig. (2). As this ﬁgure indicates, a large amount of wa-
ter vapor evaporates into the bubble during the expan-
sion.
Indeed, at maximum radius, most of the bubble
content is water vapor. During the collapse, the water

vapor molecules rapidly condense to the liquid. It is seen
that the remarkable diﬀerence between the two cases also
appears on the variations of the number of H2O particles
after the collapse. Note that, the diﬀerence gradually
disappears as the bubble rebounds weaken.

In Fig. (3), the gas temperature evolution during the
bubble rebounds and at the end of the collapse have
been demonstrated. Damping feature of the new term
is clearly observed by considerable decrease of the peak
temperature at the collapse time as well as remarkable re-
duce of the secondary peak temperatures. Also, the pulse
width of the main peak temperature decreases with the
addition of the new terms.

Figures (4) and (5) illustrate dependence of the bubble
properties at the end of the collapse to the variation of
the amplitude and the frequency of driving pressure for
the two cases. The diﬀerent values of Pa, corresponding
to a speciﬁc values of R0, can be experimentally obtained
by varying the concentration of the dissolved gas in the
liquid [21, 36, 37, 38]. Also, the frequency range in the
calculations of Fig. (5) is in the range of the experimental
results [21].

Figure (4) shows the variation of the peak tempera-

The equilibrium radius was ﬁxed (R0 = 4.5 µm). Other con-
stants are the same as Figs. (1-3).

ture, the peak pressure, and the minimum radius as a
function of the driving pressure amplitude. The ambient
radius was ﬁxed (R0 = 4.5 µm). The damping feature of
the new viscous terms is clearly observed in this ﬁgure.
For the peak temperature in Fig. 4(a), the maximum
relative diﬀerence appears around Pa = 1.25 atm (about
35%). The diﬀerence between the two cases decreases for

higher driving pressures. However, for the peak pressure
in Fig. 4(b), the diﬀerence increases with the increase
of the amplitude. The values of Rmin for the two cases
are similar in high driving pressures because of the ef-
fects of the excluded volume, which prevent the bubble
compression [33].

Figure (5) represents the dependence of the bubble
characteristics at the end of the collapse to the varia-
tions of the driving pressure frequency. The ambient ra-
dius and the amplitude were ﬁxed in these calculations
(R0 = 4.5 µm and Pa = 1.35 atm). As Fig. (4), the
damping feature of the new terms is also seen here. The
diﬀerence between the two cases for the peak temperature
and the minimum radius increases when the frequency is
increased. While, for the peak pressure the diﬀerence
reduces with the increase of the frequency.

A major deﬁciency of the old bubble dynamics equa-
tions is that for strongly driven bubbles, such as sonolu-
minescence bubbles, large amplitude rebounds are pro-
duced after the collapse, so that they often last until
the next acoustic cycle of the periodic driving pressure.
This is in contrast with the experimental results, which
show rapidly damped rebounds [21, 39]. By introducing
a damping term arisen from the gas compressibility, Moss
et. al [39] provided a typical solution for this problem.
The eﬀects of the suggested term by Moss et. al is very
similar to the damping eﬀects of the new terms in this
paper, (compare Fig. 1(b) with Figs. (3) and (4) of Ref.
[39]). It seems the damping feature of the the new terms
is a better way for solving the mentioned problem. The
reason is that Eq’ns. (34) and (35) have been derived di-
rectly from the basic equations of ﬂuid mechanics, on the
contrary to Eq’n. (3.2) of Ref.
[39], which was derived
by an approximate method.

V. CONCLUSIONS

8

The equations of the bubble motion in a compressible
viscous liquid were newly derived from the full Navier-
Stokes equations. These equations contain two similar
new terms resulted from the simultaneous eﬀects of the
liquid viscosity and compressibility. These new terms
have a considerable damping role at the collapse, when
the bubble motion is signiﬁcantly compressible. This
new damping mechanism dramatically changes the bub-
ble properties at the end of the collapse and during the
bubble rebounds.

The results of this work indicate that, the neglect of
the new terms in the previous works is not reasonable
for the collapse time and the new eﬀects should be con-
sidered for the prediction of the quantities related to the
collapse, e.g., the value of light emission by a single sono-
luminescing bubble as well as the bubble stability limits.

(Received 17th December 2013)

We study the weakly non-linear development of shear-driven gravity waves, following
the physical mechanism ﬁrst proposed by Miles and furthermore investigate the mixing
properties of the ﬁnite amplitude solutions. Calculations to date have been restricted
to the linear theory, which predicts that gravity waves are ampliﬁed by an inﬂux of en-
ergy through the critical layer, where the velocity of the wind equals the wave phase
velocity. Because of the presence of a critical layer, ordinary weakly non-linear meth-
ods fail; in this paper, we use a rescaling at the critical layer and matched asymptotics
to derive an amplitude equation for the most unstable wave, under the simplifying as-
sumption that the physical domain is periodic. These amplitude equations are solved
numerically, in their quasi-steady limit, for the cases of small density ratio (applicable
to oceanography), and for arbitrary density ratio but strong stratiﬁcation (for more gen-
eral physical/astrophysical situations). As is found in other analysis for critical layers in
inviscid parallel ﬂow, we ﬁnd that the initial exponential increase of the amplitude A

mode show that the transition from exponential to algebraic growth rate occurs when

the amplitude of the wave is as small as h

cases in which the physical domain is not periodic, so that the marginally stable modes
form a continuum, is not as yet known.) We also ﬁnd that the weakly non-linear ﬂow
allows for super-diﬀusive particle transport with an exponent
3/2, consistent with
Venkataramani’s results.

1. Introduction

§

The generation of surface waves by winds has been a problem under study for well over
a century. The simple model of Kelvin-Helmholtz (from now on, KH) instability provided
higher bounds on the maximum wind velocity for the instability to occur than what was
101); and a solution was not available
experimentally observed (Chandrasekhar (1961),
until Miles (1957, 1959a,b, 1962, 1967) proposed a model in which gravity ocean waves are
ampliﬁed through a ‘resonant’ interaction with the wind above the ocean surface: Waves
that travel with speed c =
g/k are ampliﬁed through an inﬂux of energy at the height
yc in the wind where the wind speed U (y) matches the wave speed, U (y = yc) = c. Miles
explicitly assumed that the wind proﬁle above the sea surface was of the form log(z/z∗)
(where z∗ is a parameter), composed of a mean velocity U and a turbulent component
u. Assuming the mean wind proﬁle to be given from turbulent boundary layer theory
and the turbulent component to be small, he calculated the inﬂux of energy to the wave.
This analysis involved the treatment of the critical layer (the point where the velocity
of the wind was equal to the velocity of the gravity wave), where the solution of the
linear eigenfunction problem becomes singular (the x-component of the perturbation
yc)). The singularity is removed either because there is
velocity behaves as u
an imaginary component of c (i.e., unsteady critical layer) or because viscosity becomes
important in this thin layer (i.e., viscous critical layer). In both cases, the ﬁnal result
is that there is an ‘
iπ phase change’ across the critical layer, e.g., the perturbation
wave above the critical layer is not in phase with the wave below. A direct result of this
phase change is that the gravity wave will become unstable because a component of the
pressure perturbation will be in phase with the slope of the wave (unlike the KH case,
in which the pressure perturbation wave is always in phase with the wave). Using the
results from linear theory and for small density ratios, Miles predicted the energy ﬂux
from the wind to the gravity wave.

Our interest in this problem is motivated by an astrophysical puzzle, namely, the
mixing of carbon/oxygen (C/O) at the surface of a white dwarf with accreted material
(mostly hydrogen and helium, He/H) overlying the stellar surface (whose presumed origin
is from an accretion disk surrounding the compact star). For a variety of reasons, it is
thought that the accreted envelope is in diﬀerential rotation with respect to the stellar
surface, so that a ‘wind’ is expected at this surface (Rosner, Alexakis, Young & Truran,
Hillebrandt 2001). In this stellar case, one is forced to generalize the earlier results to
arbitrary density ratios (between the ‘atmosphere’ and the ‘surface material’); and we
have already done so for the linear problem (Alexakis, Young & Rosner 2002), deriving
bounds on the instability in the parameter space, and estimating the growth rates of
the unstable modes. While useful as a starting point for further analysis, linear theory
gives no information about the ultimate fate of the system, which is largely governed by
nonlinear processes. In this paper, we uncover the non-linear eﬀects on the evolution of
wind-driven surface waves by examining their ﬁnite-amplitude evolution. To explore the
applications to the relevant astrophysical and geophysical systems, we also investigate
the mixing property of the weakly non-linear ﬂow using particle method, and results
show enhanced mixing due to the coupling of the weakly nonlinear wind with the surface
wave.

We note here that the weakly non-linear theory for the KH instability has already
been derived by Drazin (1970). That analysis cannot be applied straightforwardly to our
problem because of the presence of critical layers: Due to the singularity that appear in
the linear theory at the point where the phase speed of a surface wave matches the wind
speed, higher order terms in the expansion become more singular and the expansion must

ultimately fail. The fundamental reason for this behavior is that the ﬂow becomes non-
linear ﬁrst inside the critical layer even though the rest of the ﬂow can still be considered
as operating in the linear regime. For this reason, a more reﬁned treatment of the critical
layer is required. The necessary analytical ‘machinery’ fortunately already exists: Thus,
Benney & Bergon (1969), and later Benney & Maslowe (1975), observed that for small
but ﬁnite amplitudes the phase change at the critical layer does not necessarily have to
be
iπ; instead, they found a solution with the property that if the nonlinear terms are
taken into account, the phase change is zero. Later Haberman (1972) showed numeri-
cally that there is a smooth increase of the phase change, from
iπ to 0, and introduced
the function Φ that gives the phase change as a function of the amplitude; Churilov &
Shukman (1987, 1988, 1996) then developed a weakly nonlinear theory based on Φ and
other similar functions deﬁned for the appropriate critical layer problem. A fundamental
assumption in all this work is that the viscosity is dominant in the critical layer; this
leads to the derivation of an ordinary diﬀerential equation for the wave amplitude. The
full equations of the weakly nonlinear problem without making the previous assumption
have then been solved numerically for various cases (Goldstein & Hultgen 1988; Warn &
Warn 1978; Balmforth & Piccolo 2001).

−

In our case the treatment – although closely related to the earlier work – is nevertheless
diﬀerent in two respects. The ﬁrst one is that the previous cases possess stability bound-
y U/∂y2 = 0;
aries for modes for which the critical layer is formed at the inﬂection point ∂2
one then examines the close-to-marginally-stable state unstable modes. This is however
) as
not our case since such an inﬂection point does not exist (unless one considers U (
such a point). Instead, we will be considering two special cases: the case of small density
ratio, and the case of very strong stratiﬁcation
; in both cases, the linear growth rate is
†
small. This procedure will lead to a slightly diﬀerent scaling. The second diﬀerence lies
in the fact that we have an interface. Because of this, our solvability condition will not
be expressed in terms of integrals but rather in terms of appropriate vector products of
the values of the perturbation stream function at the interface.

We consider a two-layer system with constant ﬂuid density ρ1 and ρ2 (ρ1 ≤
respectively, in the upper and lower layers. The interface between the two layers is given
by y = h(x, t), where x is the horizontal and y is the vertical coordinate. In the upper
layer we assume a wind parallel to the originally ﬂat interface y = h(x, t = 0) = 0. The

layer is initially at rest. Our aim is to study the dynamics and the weakly nonlinear
development of a small sinusoidal perturbations of the horizontal interface.

‡ As an aside, we note that the presence of a sharp interface boundary between the two ﬂuids
in our system is really only a device to simplify the analysis, but in no way restricts our results.
That is, in a more general case there will be no sharp interface, but the density will change
smoothly from ρ2 to ρ1 in a layer of width δ1. We would then also expect U (y) to be a smooth
function in y, so that any ﬂow discontinuity at the interface would be replaced by a smooth
variation in U within a thin viscous boundary layer of width δ2. One would then expect to see
diﬀerences in behavior only for those modes with horizontal wavenumber k large enough so that
the critical layer lies inside these layers δ1, δ2. Such modes, however, are KH-modes which are
not under study here; they will obey a Richardson-type stability criterion, 1/4 < g(∆ρ/ρ)δ2

(Chandrasekhar 1961). We therefore expect our assumption of a sharp interface to be reasonable
−1 ≥ max{δ1, δ2}. Since we are primarily interested in long wave-

general features of the stability boundaries summarized here for wind proﬁle in equation
(3.5) also hold for other bounded wind proﬁles. The stability bound comes from the
modes that have phase velocity C = 1, in which case the solution of equation (3.1)

bounds is simple: In order for a mode to become unstable for the above wind proﬁle, the
phase velocity of the wave must lie in the range 0 < c < Umax (Alexakis, Young & Rosner
2002). With the inclusion of surface tension, the phase velocity is not monotonic with
K, but for large enough K, the phase velocity increases in an unbounded fashion. This
leaves only a ﬁnite region in K space with phase velocity smaller than Umax; moreover,
if the surface tension is large enough, the minimum phase velocity is larger than Umax,
and therefore no unstable mode exists.

the exponentially large component must be in phase with h, which leaves us with the
exponentially small, out of phase, component to drive the wave unstable. A detailed
calculation then leads to the result given above.

4. Weakly nonlinear theory

∼

We are now ready to embark upon the weakly non-linear theory. Formally this is
done by assuming that, for some parameter ranges of interests, our physical system lies
close to a marginally stable state so that an asymptotic expansion is allowed near the
center manifold. For the problem at hand, however, and in the absence of surface tension
(
= 0), marginally stable states are possible only when r = 0 or 1/G = 0 (we note
T
that K is not a control parameter); the ﬁrst one expresses the unphysical situation that
there is no upper ﬂuid, and the latter corresponds to a situation where there is no wind
1/√G). Complication arises as we deviate from these neutrally
in the upper ﬂuid (U
stable states. In ordinary dissipative systems, only a small number of modes near the
center manifold become unstable and need to be considered. In our case though, once
the density ratio r or the parameter G is ﬁnite, an inﬁnite number of modes become
= 0. Ideally the interaction of all these modes needs to be
unstable if surface tension
taken into account. Practically this diﬃculty is removed by the combined eﬀect of surface
(or, equivalently, the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld) and weak viscous damping.
tension
In the presence of surface tension the stability boundary in the (r, G,
) space is given
by the condition for positive solutions of eq.(3.7) for r = 0. Surface tension reduces the
number of unstable modes by neutralizing modes of wave numbers above some cut-oﬀ
value. Further more weak viscosity will damp out the neutrally stable modes of high
wave numbers, rendering them asymptotically stable. Using a periodic domain we can
always ﬁx the period so that only one mode becomes unstable. We can then derive the
amplitude equation for this single mode as usual.

T

T

T

We ﬁnd that these amplitude equations are almost the same as those obtained from
asymptotic expansion around the most unstable mode without surface tension; the only
diﬀerence is a coeﬃcient dependence on the surface tension. In the following derivation,
for simplicity, we chose not to include surface tension, and assume the presence of surface
tension only implicitly. At the end of the analysis the surface tension can always be
recovered by replacing G with G +

K 2.

With the previously stated assumptions, and following the basic strategy of the weakly
nonlinear theory, we develop below an asymptotic expansion based on the small amplitude
of the perturbation, and introduce a long time scale of the same order as the nonlinear
terms inside the critical layer. We consider two diﬀerent cases: The ﬁrst case assumes that
the density ratio is small (r
1); the second case allows for arbitrary r but assumes that
1. The samll density ratio (r) in the ﬁrst case is the parameter to which we scale
G
our amplitudes. The large G and arbitrary r case, however, is a bit more complicated;
for this case, the growth rate according to linear theory is proportional to exp(
2G),
and this will be our scaling parameter.

T

4.1. Small density ratio case
We start with the small r case. The following analysis applies to for a monotonicly
increasing but otherwise arbitrary wind-proﬁle. The outline of the derivation is as follows:
we write the Euler equations, and the boundary conditions, in the reference frame of the
moving wave. We introduce the scaling discussed below, and solve up to the second order;
this requires a more detailed treatment at the critical layer that determines the phase
change across the layer. Using matched asymptotics, we match the inner solution with
the Frobenius solutions φa, φb of the outer ﬂow. This introduces ﬁve diﬀerent amplitudes,
A±1 , B±1 , and A2, for each Frobenius solution above and below the critical layer (which
will be assumed to be given numerically); the ﬁfth amplitude A2 is just the surface wave
amplitude. The ﬁrst four amplitudes are connected through the boundary conditions at
inﬁnity and the matching at the critical layer; the ﬁfth is connected with the rest through

8

the boundary conditions at the interface. When we apply the boundary conditions, the
ﬁrst order gives the free gravity wave (vacuum over water); at second order, the solvability
condition results in the amplitude equation.

We begin by introducing the scaling. Let ǫ

The equations above should be interpreted the following way. Equation (5.2) expresses
the continuity of the normal velocity at the interface: It imposes the constraint that the
phase and amplitude of the perturbation of the surface wave (given by A2) is the same as
the perturbation of the wind (given by
D2J) including the component that comes
D1A1 +
from the phase change at the interface. Equation (5.1) is Newton’s law, or alternatively
can be viewed as a statement about the continuity of pressure at the interface; it gives the
growth of the amplitude A2 due to the out of phase component of the pressure. Equation
(5.4) gives the evolution of the vorticity inside the critical layer that determines the phase
change, and involves the non-linear term ˜Ψ0,xZ,Y . The coeﬃcients
are
obtained from the linear theory, and are given in equations (4.22), (4.24), (4.48) and
D2 are terms that involve small correction to the real part of C due to

depends on the value of A1, which then makes J just a function of A1. More speciﬁcally

This is one of the basic results of our calculations. As we are going to show later,
this result becomes valid for later times even for cases for which the rescaled viscosity
is smaller than one. An important implication of this result is that the amplitude grows
with an algebraic power instead of the initial exponential variation. Another important
feature is that the growth rate linearly depends on the viscosity, unlike the case in linear
theory. (In linear theory, a weak viscosity was giving the same phase change “
iπ”, but
the resulting growth rate was independent of ν.) Finally we note that the phase of the
waves Θ, goes assymptoticaly to zero at late times according to equation (5.19).

5.3. Numerical Results
Next we investigate the weakly non-linear evolution of the wave by solving the set of
equations (5.1-5.4) numerically. To solve the advection equation (5.4), we used a code
which is spectral in x and ﬁnite diﬀerence in Y . The domain we used was (
50, 50) in Y
and (0, 2π) in x. Up to 1024 grid points were used in the Y direction and 63 modes were
kept in x. The boundary conditions were satisﬁed to order 1/Y , although the asymptotic
behavior of Z was taken into account when we evaluated the integral in equation (5.3).
The code was tested by comparing with a fully pseudo-spectral code as well as with
already published results.

Before we begin solving the amplitude equations, however, we re-scale our system so
that we are left with a minimum number of free parameters. As in the previous section,
˜Z, Y = η/√U ′, T = τ /(√U ′k), ξ = Kx and ν = ν′/√U ′ we
by letting Z = U ′′/√U ′
obtain the following equation to be solved:

We ﬁrst examine

D2 = 0 case, e.g. the evolution of a ‘free critical layer’. In ﬁgure (2a) we
plot the amplitude as a function of time; the dashed line gives the linear prediction. The
amplitude grows exponentially for early times, but as non-linearities become important
the growth rate decreases, and an oscillatory behavior begins. ﬁgure (2b) shows the same
thing, but plotted on a log-log scale, and compared with the T 2/3 scaling; we note that the
agreement is good for later times, although the persistence of the oscillations indicate
that viscosity is not yet fully dominant. Figure (2c) gives us more information about
as a function of time. The phase
the system; here we plot the phase change
change (which is responsible for the instability) remains constant, and equal to
π, in
the linear regime; in the non-linear regime it drops to zero and then oscillates around
this value. In ﬁgure (3) we display the evolution of the total vorticity ˜Z + η inside the
critical layer, using a grey-scale representation; time frame were taken every 0.5 time
units (the ﬁrst panel is at T = 1). The vorticity of the mode rises, as predicted by the
linear theory, by extracting vorticity from the mean ﬂow. (From eqs. (5.9) and (5.11) we
know that the total vorticity and enstrophy are conserved; therefore the increase of Z 2
must lead to a decrease of ZY .) As the non-linear term becomes important, the mean
ﬂow advects the vorticity in the vertical direction, leading to the ‘winding up’ motion
seen in the panels with T
2, forming the cat’s eyes pattern. The imaginary part of
the integral J (eq. (5.3)) expresses the excess of vorticity of the right side of each panel,

from the left. After the ﬁrst turnover, the vorticity is redistributed inside the critical
layer more evenly, leading to smaller values of J. Comparing ﬁgure (2) with ﬁgure (3),
it can be seen that deviations from linearity and the
iπ phase change start when the
vertical motion begins, and the phase change has dropped to zero when the ﬁrst full turn
over has been completed. At later times and after a few turnovers, small scale structure
has been generated in the form of a ‘twisted’ vortex sheet with sharp boundaries. As
this procedure carries on, at some point in time, viscosity (now matter how small) will
become important, and the advection terms in eq. (5.4) will be balanced by the diﬀusion
of vorticity; at that point, the asymptotic behavior predicted by the quasi-steady state
for large times can been shown to hold.

6. Mixing in the cat’s eye

In the previous sections we have examined the cat’s eye vortices in the nonlinear
evolution of the critical layer in the wind coupled to a surface wave. We have found
that the general ﬂow structure to be similar to those in cases without coupling to the
gravity waves. Such vortical structures are typical of the weakly nonlinear evolutions of
parallel ﬂows (Balmforth & Piccolo 2001). However, their mixing properties may be very
diﬀerent (depending on the details of the underlying ﬂow) in spite of great similarity in
the general ﬂow features. We thus investigate the mixing due to these cat’s eyes from the
weakly nonlinear amplitude equations for a few diﬀerent cases.

In our amplitude equation 5.4, the vorticity Z is advected by velocity (u, v) = (Y,

Ψ0x),
A1eiKx +c.c.. Thus the particle trajectories (x(x0; t), y(y0; t)) satisfy equations

If A1 is constant in time, equations (6.1)-(6.2) reduce to the equations of motion for
a pendulum, only in this case the particle trajectory is not restricted to a cylindrical

ﬂow by ﬁrst linearizing equations (6.1)-(6.2) for an inﬁnitesimal separation between two

From ﬁgures (10)-(11) we conclude that the coupling of shear ﬂow to the surface wave
induces nonlinear evolution in such a fashion that more chaotic mixing may occur in the
latter case; this conclusion follows from the observation that there appear to be more
stripes of positive Lyapunov exponent in the driven surface wave case.

In situations where the passive tracers are weakly diﬀusive, the asymptotic mixing
property is determined by the combination of slow diﬀusion and fast advection. If we
deﬁne θ as the tracer concentration, we can write down the equation for the weakly
diﬀusive tracer in the above ﬂow ﬁeld, (equations 6.1 and 6.2),

If the ﬂow is weak and diﬀusion is strongly dominant over advection, particles undergo
random walks and their dispersion (σ) increases linearly with the square root of time:
σ = (2t/Pe)1/2. On the other hand, if the shear ﬂow is strong and irregular in time,
the particles will be in a super-diﬀusive regime during which the dispersion grows faster
than that for ballistic transport (σ
t). In cases where the ﬂow is bounded and time-
independent, the super-diﬀusive regime eventually gives way to yet another diﬀusive
(Taylor) regime with a larger eﬀective diﬀusivity than molecular diﬀusion.

∼

For a time-dependent velocity ﬁeld, the super-diﬀusive regime will be the asymptotic
limit of particle transport, and chaotic mixing may be found instead. To examine how the
time dependence of the ﬂow aﬀects the particle mixing in our case, we have integrated
equation (6.6) using a particle method ((Latini & Bernoﬀ 2001) and references therein)
with a0(t) and φ(t) resembling those from solving the amplitude equations. We place
105 particles at an initial position close to the separatrix around the core, solve for their
positions according to equation (6.6) for Pe = 105, and record their positions from which
we can calculate the particle dispersion. In our case (equations 6.1 and 6.2), ballistic
transport is expected (and conﬁrmed numerically) if there is no time variation in A1.

Figures (12) show the dispersion σ versus time for three time dependences of the
amplitude a0. The solid line is for an exponential growing amplitude which saturates to
100, and then oscillates periodically with a ﬂuctuation amplitude of 0.2 and
a0 ∼
a period of 6. The long dashed line is the same except the oscillatory period is 65. The
dash-dotted line is the same as the ﬁrst two cases except the oscillation is replaced by an
algebraic growth proportional to t2/3. We clearly see that the early time dependence from
simulations is veriﬁed as the diﬀusive regime, where σ = (2t/Pe)1/2. We also observe that
t3/2
the long time asymptotics for all three cases are at least super-diﬀusive, with σ
for cases 1 and 2, while for case 3, where the amplitude grows as t2/3, the dispersion is
close to σ

t2.

These results are consistent with anomalous diﬀusion found in other two-dimensional

ates the possibility for KAM regions to coexist with chaotic regions, and thus the anoma-
lous particle transport. However, for the third case, the time variation of the ﬂow is not
periodic, and there does not exist any KAM regions, and thus the particle transport is
more super-diﬀusive.

7. Discussion and Conclusion

In this paper, we have extended our earlier linear analysis of the resonant interaction

between a wind and interface waves to the weakly nonlinear regime.

Our principal result is the demonstration that the exponential growth of unstable
resonant waves characteristic of the linear regime transitions to algebraic growth in the
weakly nonlinear regime, with the wave amplitude growing as t2/3, similar to the cases
without coupling with the gravity waves. We also ﬁnd that the algebraic growth is linearly
proportional to the weak viscosity inside the critical layer.

Before continuing, we return to examine our assumptions which allowed us to carry
out the weakly nonlinear analysis. As noted earlier, our analysis is carried out around
the point where the most unstable mode becomes marginally stable (which corresponds
to, for example, the condition
G = 1/4 for r = 0). In terms of dimensional parameters,
this means that we conduct our analysis for values of the maximum wind velocity U in
the range

T

U1 < U < U2 ,
(7.1)
where U1 is found from the criterion that all the perturbations are neutral in the presence
of surface tension for r = 0:

G =

and U2 is deﬁned as the upper bound on the maximum wind speed for which only one of
the unstable modes has crossed the stability boundary. This latter condition arises from
the assumption of a periodic domain, which leads to a discrete spectrum, and is crucial
in numerical simulations.

First we note that equation 7.2 gives a lower bound on maximum wind velocity (U2)

Within the range of validity of our analysis, we can further examine when the evolu-
tion transitions from linear to nonlinear regimes, e.g., the transition from exponential to
algebraic growth. For small density ratio (the air-over-water case), and for high Reynolds
numbers (for which the results from
5.3 hold), this transition happens when the am-

the rescaled Reynolds number is small enough so that the quasi-steady state approxima-

tion (
§
λ is close to one (λ
1; see ﬁgure 1). This implies that the transition amplitude scales
as h/l
1/Re, which is still very small since we are in the almost inviscid limit. The key
point, however, is that in both cases, the amplitude at which the transition in behav-
ior occurs is extremely small, and most likely is too small to be observed in numerical
simulations. Thus, any linear growth observed in simulations can only result from wind
1. Our results also indicate that the

much stronger than 0.2 m s−

Furthermore, we note that the linear regime (e.g., exponential growth) would be ob-
servable if the wind velocity is larger than order one. For example, if 1
r, then
the linear growth rate will be larger than order r; this implies a diﬀerent scaling than
ǫ = r. (The derivation of the new scaling is straightforward, but depends on the how

For astrophysical cases, for which the density ratio is not so small (r

much easier to capture both scalings (exponential and algebraic), in either numerical and

the fully non-linear development of the waves; and this is what we intend to do in our

applies to situations in which the physical domain is not periodic, such as in laboratory
experiments.

Finally, we note that we have obtained an interesting result, namely the enhanced
mixing at the ‘saddle points’ separating successive cat’s eyes within the unstable interface;
this enhanced mixing (which we studied by means of inserting Lagrangian tracers, and
observing their evolution) is a consequence of the dynamics near the ‘saddle’, where
mixing between two adjacent vortices appears to take place. These islands around the
separatrices are commonly found in non-integrable Hamiltonian systems, and here they
serve as implication of chaotic mixing. Results from the particle analysis further conﬁrm
that chaotic mixing is a consequence of the temporal behavior of the amplitude associated
with the global background ﬂow. Even though we have assumed much simpler temporal
behavior for the amplitude in our simulations, the super-diﬀusion found in the simpler
cases aﬃrms that chaotic mixing should be expected as a result of the instability of the
shear ﬂow coupled to the gravity surface waves. This may imply that the entrainment
rate of humidity into air could be enhanced by the coupling of weak wind with suface
waves.

The calculations presented here will serve as a useful constraint for future numerical
simulations of wind-driven interface instabilities. Thus, paradoxically, while tests of nu-
merics involving the linear behavior of such systems can be done, they are challenging
to apply; in contrast, it should be relatively easy to test the numerics in the weakly
nonlinear limit.

Appendix
A. Large G behavior

We are interested in cases for which the factor G is large. As already discussed, such
cases not only correspond to the astrophysical limit of strong surface stratiﬁcation, but
also correspond to cases for which the growth rate of (linearly) unstable modes is small,
i.e., to cases for which our analysis is actually appropriate.

In order to proceed, we need to adopt a speciﬁc wind proﬁle; in what follows, we will
y). However, we note that our basic results
use a proﬁle of the form U = Umax(1
hold for more general wind proﬁles. From equation 3.6 we know that the unstable modes
will have to be of the same order as G, and therefore K
1; this allows us to write a
WKBJ expansion for the solution of the perturbation stream function of equation (3.1)
for the wind. The equation we have to solve for large K is therefore

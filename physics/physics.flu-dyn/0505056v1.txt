Hydrodynamic interactions in a suspension of spherical particles conﬁned between
two parallel planar walls are studied under creeping-ﬂow conditions. The many-particle
friction matrix in this system is evaluated using our novel numerical algorithm based
on transformations between Cartesian and spherical representations of Stokes ﬂow. The
Cartesian representation is used to describe the interaction of the ﬂuid with the walls
and the spherical representation is used to describe the interaction with the particles.
The transformations between these two representations are given in a closed form, which
allows us to evaluate the coeﬃcients in linear equations for the induced-force multipoles
on particle surfaces. The friction matrix is obtained from these equations, supplemented
with the superposition lubrication corrections. We have used our algorithm to evalu-
ate the friction matrix for a single sphere, a pair of spheres, and for linear chains of
spheres. The friction matrix exhibits a crossover from a quasi-two-dimensional behavior
(for systems with small wall separation H) to the three-dimensional behavior (when the
distance H is much larger than the interparticle distance L). The crossover is especially
pronounced for a long chain moving in the direction normal to its orientation and parallel
to the walls. In this conﬁguration, a large pressure buildup occurs in front of the chain
for small values of the gapwidth H, which results in a large hydrodynamic friction force.
A standard wall superposition approximation does not capture this behavior.

1. Introduction

Numerous recent papers reﬂect a growing interest in the static and dynamic proper-
ties of suspensions in conﬁned geometries. There are investigations of the formation of
colloidal crystals on patterned and planar surfaces (Lin et al. 2000; Seelig et al. 2002;
Subramanian et al. 1999), studies of single-ﬁle diﬀusion of Brownian particles in a chan-
nel (Wei et al. 2000), and experiments on quasi-two-dimensional suspensions conﬁned
between two planar walls (Carbajal-Tinoco et al. 1997; Lan¸con et al. 2001; Marcus et al.
1999; Santana-Solano & Arauz-Lara 2001). Quasi-two-dimensional suspensions of parti-
cles adsorbed at a ﬂuid interface (Zahn et al. 1997; Rinn et al. 1999; Cichocki et al. 2004)
or conﬁned in a thin liquid ﬁlm (Sethumadhavan, Nikolov & Wasan 2001) have also been
examined.

Experiments on quasi-two-dimensional systems revealed many striking phenomena
like, for instance, the ﬁrst-order transitions between ﬂuid, hexatic, and solid phases
(Marcus & Rice 1997), string-like cooperative motion of suspension particles (Marcus, Schoﬁeld & Rice

S. Bhattacharya, J. B lawzdziewicz and E. Wajnryb

1999), and oscillatory melting of a crystalline phase in shear ﬂow (Stancik & Hawkinson
2003). Other interesting examples include a logarithmic behavior of the mean-square dis-
placement of Brownian particles in quasi-two-dimensional systems, predicted by Cichocki & Felderhof
(1994) and observed by Marcus et al. (1999); a hydrodynamic enhancement of self-
diﬀusion for strongly-charged particles (Zahn et al. 1997; Pesch´e & N¨agele 2000), and
migration of particles in Poiseuille ﬂow towards the channel center (Nott & Brady 1994;
Lyon & Leal 1998).

The particle–wall and interparticle interaction potentials fully determine the equilib-
rium structure of conﬁned colloidal suspensions. The dynamics of such systems, how-
ever, is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the many-body hydrodynamic forces. For spherical par-
ticles in an unbounded space, eﬃcient algorithms for evaluating many-body friction and
mobility matrices have been developed (Durlofsky, Brady & Bossis 1987; Ladd 1988;
Cichocki, Felderhof, Hinsen, Wajnryb & B lawzdziewicz 1994; Sierou & Brady 2001). Us-
ing the image representation technique, such algorithms have been generalized for parti-
cles adsorbed on a planar ﬂuid–air interface (Cichocki et al. 2004) and for particles con-
ﬁned in a thin liquid ﬁlm (B lawzdziewicz & Wajnryb 2003). The image-representation
method has also been proposed for a suspension bounded by a single rigid planar wall
(Cichocki & Jones 1998; Cichocki et al. 2000). A two-wall generalization of this method
(Bhattacharya & B lawzdziewicz 2002a) and several other techniques were used to de-
scribe motion of an individual particle between two planar walls (Ganatos et al. 1980b,a;
Staben et al. 2003; Jones 2004).

The hydrodynamics of many particles in the two-wall geometry is much more complex,
and available results are limited. Durlofsky & Brady (1989) have developed a method
that combines boundary-integral and Stokesian-dynamics elements. In their approach,
the walls are discretized, and the particles are represented using low-order force mul-
tipoles and lubrication contributions, as in the standard Stokesian-dynamics algorithm
(Durlofsky et al. 1987). It seems that this method has not been further pursued. In an
alternative approach, Nott & Brady (1994) and Morris & Brady (1998) studied ﬂows
in wall-bounded suspensions by modeling the walls as static, closely packed arrays of
spheres, and using the standard Stokesian-dynamics algorithm for an unbounded system
to evaluate the motion of the suspended particles. The results obtained in this way are
only qualitative, especially for small wall separations, because the walls are porous and
rough. Recently, a two-wall superposition approximation was used by Pesch´e & N¨agele
(2000) and several other groups, but the validity range of this approximation cannot be
determined without comparison with more accurate results.

In our paper we present a novel, highly accurate algorithm to evaluate the many-body
hydrodynamic interactions in a suspension of spherical particles conﬁned between two
planar walls. In our approach, the ﬂow ﬁeld in the system is expanded using two basis
sets of solutions of Stokes equations—the spherical and Cartesian bases. The spherical
basis is applied to describe the ﬂow ﬁeld scattered from the particles, and the Cartesian
basis is used in the analysis of the interaction of the ﬂow with the walls. The key result
of our study is a set of transformation formulas for conversion between the spherical
and Cartesian representations. In our algorithm the expansion of the ﬂow ﬁeld into the
basis ﬁelds is combined with the two-particle superposition approximation for the friction
matrix in order to incorporate slowly convergent lubrication corrections. Since the force
multipoles induced on particle surfaces are included to arbitrary order, results of arbitrary
accuracy are obtained.

Our paper is organized as follows. The induced-force formulation of the problem is de-

2. Multiparticle hydrodynamic interactions

2.1. Hydrodynamic resistance

We consider a suspension of N spherical particles of the radius a in a creeping ﬂow
between two parallel planar walls. The no-slip boundary conditions are assumed on the
particles and on the walls. The walls are at the positions z = 0 and z = H, where H is the
separation between walls, and r = (x, y, z) are the Cartesian coordinates. The position of
the center of particle i is denoted by Ri = (Xi, Yi, Zi), the translational and rotational
particle velocities are denoted by Ui and Ωi, and the external forces and torques acting
on the particle are denoted by F i and T i.

We focus on a system of spheres undergoing translational and rotational rigid-body
motion with no external ﬂow. As in an unbounded space, the particle dynamics in the
system is characterized by the resistance matrix

The dot in equation (2.2) denotes the matrix multiplication and contraction of the Carte-
sian tensorial components of the resistance matrix.

2.2. Induced-force formulation

The eﬀect of the suspended particles on the surrounding ﬂuid can be described in terms
of the induced force distributions on the particle surfaces

where

Fi(r) = a−2δ(ri −

. By deﬁnition of the induced force, the ﬂow ﬁeld

v(r) =

T(r, r′) · Fi(r′) dr′

Z

Xi=1

is identical to the velocity ﬁeld in the presence of the moving particles (Cox & Brenner
1967; Mazur & Bedeaux 1974; Felderhof 1976). Here

T(r, r′) = T0(r

r′) + T′(r, r′)

−
is the Green’s function for the Stokes ﬂow in the presence of the boundaries; the Green’s
function T(r, r′) is decomposed into the Oseen tensor T0(r
r′) and the part T′(r, r′)
that describes the ﬂow reﬂected from the walls. In equation (2.5) it is assumed that the
particles move with given velocities, but no external ﬂow is imposed.

−

The resistance relation (2.2) is linked to the induced-force distributions (2.3) through

the expressions

F i =

Fi(r) dr,

T i =

ri×Fi(r) dr

Z

Z

(2.7)

for the total force and torque, respectively. To determine the resistance matrix (2.1)
we thus need to evaluate the induced forces (2.3) for given translational and angular
velocities of the particles.

2.3. Boundary-integral equations for the induced forces
For a system of particles moving with the translational and angular velocities Ui and Ωi,
the induced-force distribution (2.3) can be obtained from the boundary-integral equation
of the form

N

[Z−1

where

vrb
i (r) = Ui + Ωi ×
(2.9)
is the rigid-body velocity ﬁeld associated with the particle motion, and Si is the surface of
particle i. In the boundary-integral equation (2.8), Zi denotes the one-particle scattering
operator that describes the response of an individual particle to an external ﬂow in an
unbounded space. This operator is deﬁned by the linear relation

ri

Fi =

Zi(vin

i −

−

vrb

i ),

(2.10)

where vin
is the velocity incident to particle i. For speciﬁc particle models, explicit
i
expressions for the operator Zi are known (Jones & Schmitz 1988; Cichocki et al. 1988;
B lawzdziewicz et al. 1999).

3. Force-multipole expansion

3.1. Spherical basis ﬁelds
As in a standard force-multipole approach (Cichocki et al. 1994, 2000) the boundary-
integral equation (2.8) is transformed into a linear matrix equation by projecting it onto
a spherical basis of Stokes ﬂow. To this end we use the reciprocal basis sets deﬁned by
Cichocki et al. (1988); we introduce, however, a slightly diﬀerent normalization to exploit
the full symmetry of the problem.

The singular and nonsingular spherical basis solutions of Stokes equations v−

lmσ(r) and

where the coeﬃcients V−

monics with angular order l and azimuthal order m. This property and the r-dependence
in equations (3.1) deﬁne the Stokes-ﬂow ﬁelds v±
lmσ(r) up to a normalization constant.
Explicit expressions for the functions V±
lmσ in our present normalization are given in
Appendix A. The justiﬁcation for this choice of the normalization is discussed in Ref. I.

where η is the viscosity of the ﬂuid. Relation (3.5) assures that the Lorentz reciprocal
symmetry of Stokes ﬂow is reﬂected in the symmetry of the resulting matrix representa-
tion of the problem (Cichocki et al. 2000).

3.2. Matrix representation
The matrix representation of the boundary-integral equation (2.8) is obtained by expand-
ing the force distributions induced on each particle into the induced-force multipoles. The
force multipolar moments of the force distribution (2.3) are deﬁned by the relation

Fi(r) =

Xlmσ

fi(lmσ)a−2δ(ri −

a)w+

lmσ(ri),

(3.6)

where ri is the relative position (2.4) with respect to the particle center. According to
equations (3.5) and (3.6), the multipolar moments fi(lmσ) are identical (apart from the
trivial factor η) to the expansion coeﬃcients of the ﬂow ﬁeld scattered by an isolated
particle in unbounded space into the singular basis ﬁelds v−

lmσ.

To obtain a linear matrix equation for the set of force multipolar moments fi(lmσ),
the multipolar representation of the induced force (3.6) is inserted into the boundary-
integral equation (2.8), and the resulting expression is expanded into the nonsingular
basis solutions (3.1b). In particular, for the rigid-body velocity ﬁeld we have

vrb
i (r) =

ci(lmσ)v+

lmσ(ri),

Xlmσ

(3.7)

6

S. Bhattacharya, J. B lawzdziewicz and E. Wajnryb

where the expansion coeﬃcients ci(lmσ) are nonzero only for l = 1 and σ = 0, 1.

As the result of this procedure we get the linear force-multipole equation, which can

be written in the form

N

Xj=1 Xl′m′

Mij(lm

l′m′) · fj(l′m′) = ci(lm).

|

(3.8)

We use here a matrix notation in the three-dimensional linear space with the compo-
nents corresponding to the indices σ = 0, 1, 2 that identify the tensorial character of the
basis ﬂow ﬁelds (3.1). Accordingly, the arrays fj(l′m′) and ci(lm) have the components
fj(l′m′σ′) and ci(lmσ) and the matrix Mij (lm
l′m′σ′),
where σ, σ′ = 0, 1, 2. The many-particle resistance matrix (2.1) can be obtained by solv-
ing equation (3.8) and projecting the induced force multipoles onto the total force and
torque (2.7). Explicit expressions for the resistance matrix in terms of the generalized
friction matrix F = M−1 are given in Appendix B.

For a wall bounded system the matrix M can be decomposed into three contributions

The ﬁrst term Z−1
(l) corresponds to the one particle operator Z−1
in equation (2.8).
Accordingly, the matrix Zi(l) relates the force multipoles fi(l′m′) induced on particle i
to the coeﬃcients in the expansion of the ﬂow ﬁeld incoming to this particle into the
nonsingular spherical basis ﬁelds (3.1b). By spherical symmetry, this term is diagonal in
the multipolar orders l and m, and for rigid spheres it is explicitly known (Cichocki et al.
1988).

Cichocki et al. (2000) and by Bhattacharya et al. (2005) the matrix G0
l′m′) coin-
cides (apart from the normalization factors) with the displacement matrix for spherical
basis ﬁelds, which is explicitly known (Felderhof & Jones 1989). The only unknown com-
ponent in expression (3.9) is thus the wall contribution

(3.11)

In the following sections we express this contribution in terms of the Cartesian basis set
of Stokes ﬂows.

4. Cartesian representation

The diﬃculties associated with the evaluation of the matrix G′

ij in systems with two
planar walls stem from the incompatibility of the spherical basis ﬁelds v±
lmσ with the wall
geometry. In particular, the image representation of a force multipole (Cichocki & Jones
1998; Bhattacharya & B lawzdziewicz 2002a) is insuﬃcient for a two-wall system, due
to the slow convergence of the multiple-image series. We propose here an alternative
technique, which relies on a transformation between the spherical basis ﬁelds (3.1) and
a Cartesian basis set of Stokes ﬂows. In the Cartesian representation the ﬂow reﬂected
from the walls can be obtained in a closed form; thus the diﬃculties associated with the
multiple-image series are avoided.

According to our Cartesian representation method, the wall contribution (3.10) to

Spherical particles between planar walls

7

the matrix M is evaluated by (i) expanding the spherical basis ﬂow ﬁeld v−
l′m′σ′ (rj )
produced by a force multipole at the position rj into the Cartesian basis; (ii) solving the
two-wall problem in the Cartesian representation; and (iii) transforming the resulting
reﬂected ﬂow back to the spherical basis (3.1b) centered at the position ri. As a result
of this procedure, the matrix elements (3.10) are expressed in terms of two-dimensional
Fourier integrals with respect to the lateral coordinates x, y. Our method is outlined in
the following sections.

4.1. Cartesian basis
To describe the ﬂow ﬁeld between two walls parallel to the x–y plane, it is convenient to
use a basis set of Stokes ﬂows of the separable form

that is consistent with the wall geometry. Here

kσ(r) = V±
v±

kσ(z)eik · ρ±kz

is the projection of the vector r onto the x–y plane,

ρ = xˆex + yˆey

k = kxˆex + ky ˆey

k
is the corresponding two-dimensional wave vector, and k =
. By analogy to the spher-
|
|
ical basis (3.1), there exist three types of solutions σ = 0, 1, 2 for each k. These solutions
involve a potential ﬂow, a ﬂow with nonzero vorticity, and a pressure-driven ﬂow. Explicit
expressions for the coeﬃcients V±
kσ(z) are given in Appendix C. To achieve a substantial
simpliﬁcation of our ﬁnal results, the relative amplitudes of the three components in the
basis ﬁelds (4.1) have been carefully chosen, as discussed in Ref. I.

4.2. Transformation relations
The transformation relations between the spherical and Cartesian sets of solutions of
Stokes equations can be expressed by the formulas

4.3. Cartesian displacement formulas
In an analysis of the ﬂow between the walls it is convenient to use the Cartesian basis
ﬁelds centered at diﬀerent positions (e.g., the particle or wall position). As shown in Ref.
I, the ﬁelds (4.1) centered at diﬀerent points R1 and R2 are related by the displacement
formula

R2, and R12 = R1 −
of the coordinate system preserves the behavior of the ﬂow ﬁelds (4.1) at inﬁnity, the
superscripts in equation (4.10) are either all positive or all negative. The displacement

4.4. Single-wall reﬂection matrix
The Cartesian basis ﬁelds (4.1) are well suited for a description of the interaction of
the ﬂow with planar walls because, due to the translational invariance of the problem,
the lateral Fourier modes with diﬀerent wave vectors k do not couple. The eﬀect of a
single wall on the ﬂow ﬁeld in the system can be characterized in terms of the one-wall
reﬂection matrix Zw. To deﬁne this quantity we consider Stokes ﬂow in a ﬂuid bounded
by a single wall in the plane

z = Zw.

(4.14)

Spherical particles between planar walls

The ﬂuid occupies either the halfspace z > Zw (denoted by Ω+) or z < Zw (denoted by
Ω−).

The velocity ﬁeld in the halfspace Ω± can be uniquely decomposed into the incoming

and reﬂected ﬂows

(4.15)
The ﬂow vin
w (r) is nonsingular in
the halfspace Ω±. Thus these ﬂows have the following expansions in the Cartesian basis,

w (r) is nonsingular in the halfspace Ω∓, and the ﬂow vout

w (r).

The physical interpretation of relation (5.2) is straightforward. First, the spherical
components of the ﬂow produced by a multipolar force distribution at point j are trans-
formed by the matrix T±−
CS into the Cartesian basis. The Cartesian components of the

velocity ﬁeld are propagated by the matrix S±±
C (Rwj) to the wall, where they are scat-
tered, as represented by the matrix Zw. The reﬂected ﬁeld is propagated by the matrix
S∓∓
C (Riw) to the point i, and, ﬁnally, the ﬂow is transformed by the matrix T+∓
SC back
into the spherical basis.

Due to symmetry properties of the component matrices (cf., relations (4.6), (4.8),
(4.12), and (4.19)) the wall contribution to the Green’s matrix (5.1) satisﬁes the Lorentz
symmetry

discussed in

(1998) are used in our algorithm to accelerate the convergence of the two-wall integrals

kσ are used in the region Z < zj and the basis ﬁelds v−

The physical interpretation of equation (5.7) is similar to the interpretation of relation
(5.2), except that two separate sets of expansion coeﬃcients are now used for the ﬂow
ﬁeld incoming to the lower and upper walls, which is reﬂected in the corresponding
block structure of matrices (5.8)–(5.10). The matrix TCS(k, l′m′) transforms the ﬁeld
produced by a force multipole at the position Rj into the Cartesian basis; the basis
ﬁelds v+
kσ in the region Z > zj,
consistent with relation (4.4). The Cartesian ﬁelds are then translated to the positions
of the respective walls by the matrix ˜SWj(k). The matrix ˜ZTW(k), deﬁned by equation
(5.10), describes the interaction of the ﬂow ﬁeld with both walls. We note that this matrix
involves the displacements matrices ˜S−−
C (ZLUk), which correspond to
the propagation of the ﬂow ﬁeld between the walls in the multiple-reﬂection process.
After reﬂection from the walls is completed, the matrix ˜SiW(k) propagates the ﬂow ﬁeld
to the target point i, and the matrix TSC(lm, k) transforms it back into the spherical
representation.

In expression (3.9) for the matrix Mij the single particle scattering matrix Zi and
the unbounded-space Green’s matrix G0
ij are known explicitly (Felderhof & Jones 1989;
Cichocki et al. 1988). The remaining term—the two-wall contribution G′
ij —is evaluated
numerically, using relations (5.6)–(5.10) along with our expressions for the Cartesian dis-
placement matrices (4.12), the transformation matrices (4.8), and the single-wall scat-
tering matrix (4.19).

Taking into account the structure (4.6) of the transformation matrices T+∓

SC and T±−
CS ,
the angular integral in equation (5.1) can be performed analytically. The integration
yields the result in the form of a Hankel transform of the order m′
m. Accordingly,
only a one-dimensional integral in equation (5.6) has to be performed numerically. The
numerical integration is straightforward when the lateral separation between particles i
and j is small compared to the wall separation. For large interparticle separations ρij,
however, the integration is more diﬃcult due to the oscillatory behavior of the integrand.
To avoid numerical integration of a highly oscillatory function, the Fourier amplitude

−

in (5.6) is decomposed

˜Ψ(k) = ˜ΨL(k) + ˜ΨU(k) + δ ˜Ψ(k)
(6.1)
into the superposition of the single-wall contributions ˜ΨL and ˜ΨU, and the remaining
part δ ˜Ψ representing hydrodynamic interactions between the walls. From an analysis of

S. Bhattacharya, J. B lawzdziewicz and E. Wajnryb
12
expression (5.2) we ﬁnd that the magnitude of the single-wall Fourier amplitudes ˜ΨL(k)
and ˜ΨU(k) for large k is

˜Ψα(k)

e−k∆(α)
ij ,

∼

α = L, U,

where ∆(α)
is the vertical oﬀset between the point i and the reﬂection of point j in the

wall α. In contrast, the large-k behavior of the wall-interaction part of Fourier amplitude
(6.1) is

The lengthscale ˜∆ij equals the vertical oﬀset
between the target point i and
the closer of the two second-order images of the source point j. Since δ ˜Ψ(k) decays on
the wave-vector scale set by the distance between the walls H > min(∆(L)
ij ), a
smaller number of oscillations of the Fourier modes contributes to the integral after the
single-wall terms have been subtracted.

ij , ∆(U)

In our algorithm, the short-range function δ ˜Ψ(k) is integrated numerically. The one-
particle contributions ˜ΨL(k) and ˜ΨU(k) are evaluated analytically, using the explicit
image-representation expressions derived in Cichocki & Jones (1998). In this way we
avoid integrating a highly oscillatory function when the particles are close to a wall.
The procedure can be further improved, either by subtracting several terms associated
with higher-order wall reﬂections of the source multipole (Bhattacharya & B lawzdziewicz
2002a), or by using asymptotic formulas for the integrals (5.6). We have recently derived
a complete set of such expressions, which will be presented in a separate publication.

In order to improve convergence with the order lmax of the multipoles included in the
calculation we employ a standard technique, originally introduced by Durlofsky et al.
(1987). Accordingly, the lubrication forces that cause a slow convergence of the results
with lmax are included in the friction matrix using a superposition approximation. Both,
the interparticle and particle-wall lubrication corrections are included in this way. Follow-
ing the implementation of this method by Cichocki et al. (2000) for a single wall problem,
we represent the elements of resistance matrix ζ ij in the form

The one-particle contributions can be evaluated using a series expansion of resistance

bination with the appropriate lubrication results (Kim & Karrila 1991). The two-particle
superposition contributions ζsup,w
are evaluated in a similar way. The convergence with
the multipolar truncation order lmax for the quantity ∆ζij is fast; some convergence tests
are presented in Ref. I.

In the present implementation of our method, the numerical cost scales as O(N 3) with
the number of particles N , because the linear equation (3.9) is solved by inversion of
the matrix M. However, the numerical eﬃciency of our algorithm can be substantially

7. Results

In this section we present a set of numerical results for hydrodynamic interactions in
systems of spherical particles conﬁned between two parallel planar walls. Our goal is
both, to illustrate typical behavior of the hydrodynamic friction matrix for particles in
the conﬁned region, and to demonstrate the capabilities of our numerical algorithm. The
results for a single particle and for pairs of particles, shown in ﬁgures 1–8, were obtained
using the multipolar approximation with the truncation at the order lmax = 12. This
truncation is suﬃcient to obtain results with the accuracy better than the resolution of
the plots, even for the smallest wall separation H considered. The multi-particle results
in ﬁgures 9–11 were obtained using lmax = 8.

between the particle and the lower wall. As expected, for small values of the gap, the

(7.5) yields C( 1

3 ) = 1.49.

We note that our one-particle results agree with the numerical calculation by Ganatos et al.

(1980b,a) and with our earlier results (Bhattacharya & B lawzdziewicz 2002b) obtained
by an image-representation method (Bhattacharya & B lawzdziewicz 2002a).

ρ12 = ρ12ˆex.

To emphasize the crossover between the three-dimensional behavior for ρ12 ≪

resistance matrix either vanish or can be related to the above coeﬃcients by symmetry.

corresponding single-particle friction coeﬃcients (7.3). For small distances between the
˜a the longitudinal resistance coeﬃcient ¯ζxx

O( ˜L−1) interparticle lubrication friction; the lubrication behavior of the components
transverse to the direction of the line connecting the particle centers is ¯ζyy

to a quasi-two-dimensional far-ﬁeld asymptotic behavior at large interparticle distances.
A signature of the crossover is the kink seen in the plot of ¯ζyy

Ref. I. Since the contribution of the second particle to the self-components of the friction
matrix ¯ζαα

Figure 2. Diagonal components of translational self-resistance matrix (7.6) for pair particles
between two planar walls, scaled by corresponding one-particle values, versus dimensionless
distance (7.8c) between particle surfaces. Walls are in planes z = 0, H, and particles are on
axis x. The left and right panels correspond to center and oﬀ-center particle conﬁgurations (as
indicated). Dimensionless gap between the particles and the closer wall ǫ = 0.02 (solid line);
ǫ = 0.1 (long-dashed); ǫ = 1.0 (dash-dotted); ǫ = 4 (short-dashed); ǫ = 16 (dotted).

decays exponentially, which yields an exponential approach of the vertical component of
the friction matrix ¯ζzz

Cross-terms

The cross-elements of the self- and mutual friction matrix ¯ζxz

(unscaled) in ﬁgure 4. Since for the center particle position (7.2a) these components
vanish by symmetry, the results are presented only for the oﬀ-center conﬁguration (7.2b).
The nonzero values of the cross-resistance coeﬃcients ¯ζxz
12 arise indirectly, due to
the asymmetry of the ﬂow ﬁeld scattered from the walls. Therefore, for ˜L = 0 there is no
lubrication singularity. The cross-resistance coeﬃcients involve vertical particle motion;
thus, for large interparticle separations ¯ζxz

Amplitude of the far-ﬁeld asymptotic behavior

The behavior (7.9) and (7.10) of the two-particle resistance coeﬃcients for ˜ρ

1 is
consistent with the asymptotic expressions derived by Liron & Mochon (1976) for the
far-ﬁeld ﬂow produced by Stokeslets oriented in the direction parallel and normal to the
walls. Using the Liron–Mochon expression and applying the Stokes resistance formula
to evaluate forces acting on small particles in the space between the walls yields the
asymptotic behavior (7.10), with the amplitude given by

where ˜hi = hi/H. Figure 5 shows the dependence of the far-ﬁeld amplitude A on the

We emphasize that the far-ﬁeld form of the disturbance ﬂow produced by particles in
a domain bounded by parallel walls, and the corresponding properties of the resistance
matrix are important for understanding the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in
slit-pore geometries. A more detailed analysis of this problem will be given elsewhere.

The rapid variation of the longitudinal coeﬃcient ¯ζxx

A better insight into the mechanisms underlying the above-illustrated qualitative fea-

According to the results shown in ﬁgure 10 for the motion in the x direction, the forces
acting on the ﬁrst and the last particle in the chain are larger than the forces acting on
the particles in the chain interior. This behavior is similar for chains in the unbounded
and the wall-bounded regions. The forces are smaller for long chains, because the parti-
cles collectively drag the ﬂuid in the direction of the chain velocity. This mechanism is
diminished, but not eliminated by the wall presence.

In an unbounded space, the force distribution in a chain moving in the transverse
direction y is qualitatively similar to the distribution for the longitudinal motion discussed
above. In the wall-bounded region the results are, however, considerably diﬀerent: the
forces near the center of the chain are much larger than the forces near the chain ends.
This behavior, clearly seen in ﬁgure 10 for H/2a . 2, stems from the conservation of
the ﬂuid volume. The chain moving in the transverse direction acts like a piston pushing
ﬂuid along the space between the walls, thus producing a pressure-driven ﬂow decaying
on the lengthscale l = 2aN . The pressure increases linearly with the chain length until
it is large enough to push the ﬂuid back through the gap between the walls and the
particles. At this point, the pressure becomes independent of N. The pressure produced
by this mechanism is responsible for the large resistance coeﬃcient ¯ζyy
C of long chains in
transverse motion between closely spaced walls, as shown in ﬁgure 9.

For a chain moving in the direction z (normal to the walls) in a system with a small
value of the wall–particle gap ǫ, the resistance coeﬃcients ¯ζzz
C are dominated by the
lubrication forces between the walls and the individual particles. The coeﬃcients ¯ζzz
C are
the smallest for the spheres at the chain ends, as seen in ﬁgure 10, unlike for chains in the
inﬁnite space. This behavior stems from the presence of the geometrical constraints—
the resistance is smaller where there is more room for the ﬂuid to escape from the gaps
between the walls and the particles.

The geometrical-parameter dependence of the torque acting on individual spheres in a
translating chain is less varied, as illustrated in ﬁgure 11. In all conﬁgurations considered,
we ﬁnd that the torque on the interior spheres is much smaller than the torque at the
chain ends. An interesting feature is the sign change of the torque acting on the particle
i = 2 for the coeﬃcient ¯ζyz
T .

8. Conclusions

Many-body hydrodynamic interactions in suspensions of spherical particles conﬁned
between two parallel planar walls have been studied here theoretically and numerically .
Our primary theoretical result is a set of compact expressions for the multipolar matrix
elements of the Green’s integral operator for Stokes ﬂow in the space between the walls.
The matrix elements are given in the form of lateral Fourier integrals of products of
several simple matrices.

Our expressions have been used to develop an algorithm for evaluating many-particle
hydrodynamic friction and mobility matrices in a wall-bounded suspension. The algo-
rithm involves solving a set of linear equations for the multipolar moments of the force
distributions induced on the particles. The resulting friction matrix is corrected for the
lubrication forces by using a superposition of particle-particle and particle-wall contribu-
tions. Our algorithm yields highly accurate results—for example, the results presented
in this paper have been obtained with an accuracy better than 1 %. We note that at
each truncation of the force-multipole expansion the boundary conditions at the walls

26

S. Bhattacharya, J. B lawzdziewicz and E. Wajnryb

are exactly satisﬁed. This feature is essential for obtaining a proper far-ﬁeld behavior of
the friction matrix, including the strong backﬂow eﬀects seen for rigid arrays of spheres.
Our numerical algorithm has been used to evaluate the hydrodynamic resistance matrix
for a single particle, a pair of particles, and a system of many particles conﬁned between
two planar walls. The problem of hydrodynamic interactions in the two-wall geometry
involves several characteristic lengthscales: the particle radius a, the wall–to–wall distance
H the interactions between
H, and the lateral distance between the particles ρ. For ρ
particles are similar to those in the inﬁnite space. For ρ
H the crossover occurs to a
quasi-two-dimensional behavior in the regime ρ

≪
≈

H.

In the quasi-two-dimensional domain the vertical components of the mutual pair resis-
tance matrix decay exponentially, and the lateral components behave as O(ρ−2). More-
over, the sign of the transverse component of the resistance matrix is opposite to the
sign of this component for a pair of particles in inﬁnite space. As discussed here and
in our recent paper (Bhattacharya et al. 2005), this behavior can be explained using
the asymptotic Hele-Shaw (lubrication) form of the far-ﬁeld ﬂow produced by a moving
particle.

≫

l

≪

≪

≫

The crossover behavior is particularly pronounced for rigid arrays of spheres arranged
H, where l is the chain length,
along a line parallel to the walls. In the regime a
the hydrodynamic friction force per particle decreases as (log l)−1 for large l, similar to
the behavior in the inﬁnite space. In contrast, for l
H the longitudinal component of
the friction tensor (per particle) and the component normal to the walls tend to constant
values. Moreover, for small particle–wall gaps, the transverse component (normal to the
chain but parallel to the walls) increases linearly with the chain length before it saturates
at a value that is much higher than the corresponding value for the longitudinal motion.
As discussed in our recent paper (Bhattacharya et al. 2005), the standard wall-super-
position approximation is insuﬃcient for many problems. The resistance matrix in such
an approximation is composed from two single-wall contributions. In particular, the su-
perposition approximation yields a wrong sign of the transverse component of the mutual
pair resistance matrix and a wrong far-ﬁeld behavior of all components of this matrix. The
approximation also fails to reproduce the striking increase with the number of particles
for the transverse resistance coeﬃcient of linear arrays of spheres.

The numerical eﬃciency of our method can be substantially improved by combining
our Cartesian representation of the wall contribution to the Green’s matrix with the
asymptotic far-ﬁeld expressions for this quantity. The asymptotic expressions which we
have recently derived can be expressed in terms of multipolar solutions of Laplace’s
equation for two-dimensional pressure ﬁeld corresponding to the lubrication ﬂow in the
space between the walls. These expressions do not involve Fourier integrals, and they
can relatively easily be implemented in numerical algorithms for periodic systems and in
accelerated PPPM or fast-multipole algorithms.

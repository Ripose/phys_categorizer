Here I present a general formulation of water wave propagation and scattering over topographical
bottoms. A simple equation is found and is compared with existing theories. As an application, the

INTRODUCTION

There have been many approaches for investigating
propagation of water waves over various bottom topogra-
phies. A vast body of literature exists. For brevity, I refer
the reader to the textbook [1]. Here I would like to derive
from the ﬁrst principle a simple but coherent formulation
for the problem. It will be shown that this approximate
approach compares favorably with existing approxima-
tions when applied to the cases considered previously.
The advantage of the present approach is obvious: it is
simple, accommodating, systematic, and can be easily
numerically programmed. In particular, here I explicitly
show that it respectively recovers three previous results
for shallow water, deep water, and scattering by rigid
cylinders standing in water.
I will ﬁrst give a theory
for general bottom topographies. Then I will extend to
study the case of water wave propagation and scattering
in a column with many cylindrical steps.

II. GENERAL THEORY

Consider a water column with an arbitrary bottom to-
pography. We set up the coordinates as follows. Let the
z axis be vertical and directed upward. The x
y plane
rests at the water surface when it is calm. The depth of
the bottom, which describes the bottom topography, is
denoted by h(x, y), and the vertical displacement of the
water surface is η(x, y, t). Now we derive the governing
equations for the water waves.

Consider a vertical column with a base diﬀerential el-
ement dxdy at (x, y). The change rate of the the volume
of the column is

raphy.

B. Propagation approximation

Here we provide an approximate solution to Eqs. (7),
(8), (5), and (6). The procedure is as follows. When
the variation of the bottom topography is smaller than
the wavelength (to be determined self-consistently), we

ﬁeld can be represented by a scalar ﬁeld, i. e.

Φ(x, y, z, t).

∇
We write all dynamical variables with a time dependence
iωt (this time fact is dropped afterwards for conve-
e−
nience). This procedure leads to the following equations
for Φ.

FIG. 1: Transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients versus β = kh
for an inﬁnite step, obtained from Eq. (22). While the result
for the reﬂection agrees very well with that in Refs. [2, 3],
there is some discrepancy in the transmission results within
the range of kh between 0.4 to 1.2; the largest discrepancy of
about 15% occurs around kh = 0.8 for the transmission. The
legends are adopted from [3]

The second approximation is to ignore the summation
terms in Eq. (13). Such an approximation is based upon
the following consideration. The summation terms repre-
sent the correction of evanescent waves caused by irregu-
larities such as sudden changes of depth. As these waves
are spatially conﬁned, it is reasonable to expect that such
a correction will not aﬀect the overall wave propagation,
and the general features of the wave propagation. Indeed,
when we apply the later approximate solution to the ex-
treme case of propagation of water waves over an inﬁnite
step, we ﬁnd that our results agree reasonably well with
that from two other approximate approaches[2, 3]. For
example, the diﬀerence in the reﬂection results is uni-
formly less than a few percent for a wide range of fre-
quencies. The largest discrepancy can happen for the
transmission results, but the diﬀerence is still less than
15%. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the derived result is
in agreement with that of Kirby for the case of waves
over a ﬂat bed with small ripples [5]. As matter of fact,
in this case, it can be shown that after a mathematical
manipulation[4] Eq. (2.11) in [5] becomes essentially the
same as the following Eq. (21).

Under the above approximations, we have

ω2 = gk(x, y) tanh(k(x, y)h(x, y)),

(14)

Φ(x, y, z)

φ(x, y) cosh(k(z + h)),

E. Scattering by inﬁnite rigid cylinders

Equations (21) or (22) are also applicable to another
class of situation which has been widely studied in the
literature. That is, the scattering of water waves by inﬁ-
nite rigid cylinders situated in a uniform water column.
When applying (21) or (22) to this case, we ﬁnd that

FIG. 2: Conceptual layout: There are N cylindrical steps
located in a water column with depth h. The depths of the
steps are denoted by hi(i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) measured from the
upper surface of the water column, and the radii of the steps
are denoted by ai. The coordinates are set up as shown. The
steps are located at ~ri

obtained as we set the depths of the cylinders equal zero;

In fact, in this case,
the problem becomes equivalent to that of acoustic scat-
tering by rigid cylinders, and all the previous acoustic
results will follow[7, 8, 9, 10], such as the interesting phe-
nomenon of deaf bands.

III. WATER WAVES IN A WATER COLUMN
WITH CYLINDRICAL STEPS

The problem we are now going to consider is illustrated
by Fig. 2. We consider a water column with a uniform
depth h. There are N cylindrical steps (or holes when
hi > h) located in the water. The depths of the steps
are measured from the water surface and are denoted
by hi and the radii are ai.
In the realm of the linear
wave theory, we study the water wave propagation and
scattering by these steps.

A. Band structure calculation

When all the steps are with same h1 = h2 =

= hN
and the radius a, and are located periodically on the bot-
tom, then we can use Bloch’s theorem to study the water
wave propagation. Assume the steps are arranged either
in the square or hexagonal lattices, with lattice constant
d. Here we use the standard plane-wave approach[11, 12].
By Bloch’s theorem, we can express the ﬁeld η in the fol-
lowing form

B. Multiple scattering theory

The shallow water wave propagation in the water col-
umn with cylindrical steps can also be investigated by
the multiple scattering theory. Without requiring that
all the steps are the same, we can develop a general for-
mulism.

In the water column, the wave equation reads

ω2 = gk tanh(kh)

Equations (37) and (38) with the boundary conditions
in (39) and (40) completely determine the shallow wa-
ter wave scattering by an ensemble of cylindrical steps
located vertically in the uniform water column. By in-
specting, we see that this set of equations is essentially
the same as the two dimensional acoustic scattering by
an array of parallel cylinders[9, 13]. We following [9] to
study the scattering of shallow water waves in the present

We must stress that total wave expressed by eq. (62)
incorporate all orders of multiple scattering. We also
emphasize that the above derivation is valid for any con-
ﬁguration of the cylinder steps. In other words, eq. (62)
works for situations that the steps can be placed either
randomly or orderly.

For the special case of shallow water (kh << 1), we

need just replace Γi

n in Eq. (58) by

IV. SUMMARY

6

In summary, here we have presented a general the-
ory for studying gravity waves over bottom topographies.
The results have been extended to the case of step-wise
bottom structures. The model presented here is simple
and may facilitate the research on many unusual wave
phenomena such as wave localization[15, 16].

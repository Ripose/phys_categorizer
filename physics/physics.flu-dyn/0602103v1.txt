Abstract

We propose a new model of turbulence for use in large-eddy simulations (LES). The turbulent force,
represented here by the turbulent Lamb vector, is divided in two contributions. The contribution including
only subﬁlter ﬁelds is deterministically modeled through a classical eddy-viscosity. The other contribution
including both ﬁltered and subﬁlter scales is dynamically computed as solution of a generalized (stochastic)
Langevin equation. This equation is derived using Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) applied to the subﬁlter
scales. The general friction operator therefore includes both advection and stretching by the resolved scale.
The stochastic noise is derived as the sum of a contribution from the energy cascade and a contribution
from the pressure. The LES model is thus made of an equation for the resolved scale, including the
turbulent force, and a generalized Langevin equation integrated on a twice-ﬁner grid. We compare the
full model with several approximations. In the ﬁrst one, the friction operator of the Langevin equation
is simply replaced by an empirical constant, of the order of the resolved scale correlation time. In the
second approximation, the integration is replaced by a condition of instantaneous adjustment to the
stochastic force. In this approximation, our model becomes equivalent to the velocity-estimation model
of Domaradzki et al.
[7, 5, 8]. In the isotropic, homogeneous situations we study, both approximations
provide satisfactory results, at a reduced computational cost. The model is ﬁnally validated by comparison
to DNS and is tested against classical LES models for isotropic homogeneous turbulence, based on eddy
viscosity. We show that even in this situation, where no walls are present, our inclusion of backscatter
through the Langevin equation results in a better description of the ﬂow.

Introduction

The rationale for Large Eddy Simulation is often rooted in our inability to handle all the degrees of
freedom of a large Reynolds number turbulent ﬂow. Given that the smaller scales monopolize most of
the computing resources, it is tempting to cut through the number of degrees of freedom via an ad hoc
small-scale decimation. The price to pay is of course a need for parameterization (the so-called SubGrid
Scale models, or SGS), to make up for the energy transfer of the ghost scales. We refer the reader to
[3, 32, 28, 31] for recent reviews about modern parameterization strategies in LES. We may loosely divide
the SGS models in two classes, according to their philosophy: the ”deterministic” models based on eddy-
viscosities, and the ”stochastic” models, based on synthetic ﬁelds. In eddy-viscosity methods, the action
of small scales is parameterized via a few deterministic numbers, linked with the various components of
the subgrid-scale stress tensor. These models seek to reproduce the intensiﬁcation of energy transport
due to the action of scales widely separated from the considered one. However, they fail to reproduce
backward energy transfer (backscatter) from small to large scale, created by elongated triads in the
spectral space[30]. This eﬀect has been shown to induce a stochastic character in the LES [20]. In ideal
situations, where the turbulence is isotropic, homogeneous and far from wall, this backscatter is usually
viewed as secondary, and eddy-viscosity based models are generally satisfactory. However, in more realistic
situations, including turbulence near walls or in boundary layers, the energy backscatter has proven to

1

be an essential feature[2, 26]. Some models like mixed models based on similarity hypothesis are able to
reproduce a realistic backscatter in some situations ([15, 23]). The need for backscatter modeling also
leads to the development of ”stochastic” strategies, where the discarded small-scale motions are replaced
by a set of random numbers, mimicking either a random force or synthetic velocity ﬁelds [7, 33, 17]. In
many ways, these strategies resemble the strategies used to describe the dynamics of a heavy particle
coupled to a thermal bath involving many degrees of freedom (the so-called Brownian motion). The
decimation is here performed by substituting in place of the bath a deterministic friction and a stochastic
force, the two terms being linked through the dissipation theorem. The initial problem is then completely
described through the so-called Langevin equation.

Turbulence is typically an out-of-equilibrium system, and there is probably no hope that such a simple
description will ever be possible (would it be only because no ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem prevails in
turbulence!). However, we would like to use this analogy to motivate a new strategy for LES modeling:
replace the actual dynamics of the decimated degrees of freedom by a suitable noise, via a Langevin
equation. Although this strategy may seem close to recent models based on synthetic ﬁelds, we would like
to point out an important philosophical diﬀerence: rather than trying to estimate the actual small-scale
dynamics, we aim at trying to estimate a plausible small-scale dynamics. We believe there is no unique
solution for this last option. In the sequel, we present one solution based upon Rapid Distortion Theory
[17]. There may exist actually more eﬃcient models, based e.g. upon information theory [16].

To be more speciﬁc, consider a turbulent ﬂow, with velocity ﬁeld ui(x, t) and introduce a ﬁltering
procedure so as to separate it into a resolved ﬁeld Ui = ui and a subﬁlter ﬁeld u′
Ui. The
resolved ﬁeld obeys a dynamical equation obtained by ﬁltering of the Navier-Stokes equation, which may
conveniently be written as [39]:

(1)

Here, P is the resolved pressure and ν is the viscosity and l is a turbulent force . In idealistic situations
including a spectral gap between resolved and subﬁlter scale, the vector l is zero, and one can rigorously
show that the contribution of the remaining term is of ”diﬀusive” type (providing certain symmetries which
exclude ﬁrst order behavior such as the AKA eﬀect [11]). Even as one departs from this idealistic situation,
experimental [37] and numerical study [18] show that this term correlates strongly to the resolved velocity
gradient, thereby allowing a deterministic treatment through an eddy-viscosity of appropriate shape. In
the same time, the force vector l becomes increasingly non-negligible (it can even become dominant in 2D
situations see [17]). It is responsible for backscatter type of behaviour and needs to be modeled through
novel ”non-diﬀusive” and ”non-deterministic” strategies. In the sequel, we will therefore focus onto the
modeling of the l term, via a generalized Langevin equation ∂tl = Al+ξ where A is a generalized evolution
operator, and ξ is a noise.

However, a clear diﬃculty associated with this strategy is the lack of theoretical guide (equivalent
of the statistical mechanics in Brownian motion) to help us devising the ”best” friction, and the ”best”
stochastic force. For the time being, we then choose to pin down our model as best as possible to the real
dynamics of Navier-Stokes by trying to derive it from the original dynamical equations, rather than from
pure empirical or dimensional considerations. For this, we reformulate the RDT-Langevin model of Laval
et al. [17] in a way suitable for LES. There are of course limitations to this approach, pertaining the need
for both a simple enough model, and for tractable analytical computations. We try to formulate them
as honestly as possible by pointing out the approximation we make at the various stage of the derivation
of the model. This is done in Section 2. The LES-Langevin model is then implemented in the case
of periodic three-dimensional turbulence and comparison with other existing LES models is provided in
Section 3. Our conclusions follow in Section 4.

2 The LES-Langevin model of turbulence

2.1 Derivation of the Langevin equation

Our derivation is based on the stochastic RDT model developed by Laval et al. [19, 12, 17]. This model is
based on the observation that subﬁlter-scales are mostly slaved to resolved scales via linear processes akin
to rapid distortion. This property is substantiated by various numerical simulations, and is linked with
the prominence of non-local interactions at subﬁlter-scale [17]. Using incompressibility, the small-scale
dynamics in this model can be written as:

Here, p′ is the subﬁlter pressure, νt is a turbulent viscosity describing the non-linear interactions between
subﬁlter scales and f is a forcing stemming from the energy cascade. The latter can be shown to be
dominated by resolved scales non-linearities through fi = ∂j
. Finally, we may use the
(cid:1)
observation that subﬁlter scales vary over fast time scale with respect to resolved scales to write:

where visc gathers all the term containing ν or νt. This equation is only an approximation, in so far as
the assumption of ”rapidly varying scales” becomes less and less valid as the resolved scales and subﬁlter
velocities are becoming closer and closer in scale space. However, it seems to capture the dominant physics
of the evolution of the vector l, as will be later shown. Further, it is tempting to simplify the viscous
terms of the second equation of (3) to try and get a closed equation for l. Indeed, these terms involve an
a priori rather arbitrary turbulent viscosity and one could redeﬁne it so that the viscous terms are simply
l. Finally, we note that the terms involving the subﬁlter pressure depend
lumped into a term
on boundary conditions and on subﬁlter velocities, so that they can be thought to vary over a fast time
scale, contrarily to the f term which varies over a slow time scale. We therefore choose to collect all the
term involving the pressure and f into a noise term , ξ0 + ξ, such that ξ is a Gaussian-centered noise and

where Tij is the noise correlation function, to be speciﬁed. Note that since ξ comes from a pressure
contribution, it only aﬀects the non-soleinodal part of the turbulent force. In the sequel, since we work with
periodic boundary conditions, we can apply a simple projection procedure to work only with soleinodal
ﬁelds, thereby discarding the ξ term. We therefore leave the study of the inﬂuence of this term for future
work, involving more realistic boundary conditions such as ﬂow near walls.

Collecting all the results, we therefore obtain the following RDT based-model for the turbulent force

It takes the form of a generalized Langevin equation, with friction made of viscosity and rapid distortion
by resolved scales, and with stochastic forcing, with mean value generated through the energy cascade,
and whose correlations are physically imposed by boundary conditions via pressure terms.

Before implementing this Langevin equation into a LES model, we ﬁrst validate it through dynamical
a priori tests and seek optimal performances by tuning of νt. Our LES-Langevin model will follow after
this validation step.

2.2 Dynamical a priori testing

2.2.1 The numerical procedure

The numerical simulations described in the present paper have been performed with a spectral code over a
cubic domain. This choice is mainly motivated by its performances in terms of accuracy and its versatility
regarding any variant of our model. The aliasing is removed by keeping only the 2/3 largest modes in
each direction. The time integration is performed with a second order Adams Bashforth scheme. The
simulations with both the RDT and the LES-Langevin models are performed with a sharp cut-oﬀ ﬁlter
at k = kc. The ﬁlter may not be optimum in terms of eﬃciency, but it has the interesting properties to
clearly separate scales and to commute with derivative operators. The inﬂuence of the ﬁlter would need
to be conducted for a complete validation. The validation tests are performed on decaying and forced
isotropic homogeneous turbulence. The simulation of decaying turbulence is initialized with a Gaussian
k2/8). For the forced simulation, the forcing
velocity ﬁeld with a given energy spectra E(k, to)
F is deﬁned by F(k, t) dt = γ(k, t) u(k, t), with γ chosen so that the diﬀerence of the energy spectra
before and after the forcing (i.e. the energy injection rate
= 1.). The forcing is
concentrated at the lowest wavenumbers k such as 0 < k < 1. The initial time of the forced simulation is
chosen so that statistical properties are stabilized. The simulations are integrated over approximately 6.3

turnover time in the decaying case and 4 turnover time (after stabilization) in the forced case. A constant
molecular viscosity of ν = 0.0014 is used for all simulations. The resulting Taylor Reynolds number is
approximately constant and equal to Rλ = 200 for the forced DNS and varies from Rλ = 260 to Rλ = 26
in the decaying case. Both DNS are performed with 3413 eﬀective wavenumbers after desaliasing (5123
grid points). The space resolution allows a computation of scales down to 0.5 and 0.8 Kolmogorov scale for
the decaying and the forced DNS respectively. The simulation with LES-Langevin model are performed
with kc = 21 (423 eﬀective wavenumbers are used for the resolved scales).

2.2.2 Validation of the model

The validation of the model is conducted by dynamical tests performed with the DNS of decaying 3D
turbulence. It is performed by comparing a full DNS and a simulation at the same resolution, in which
the turbulent force l is replaced by the solution of (5). This way, we may explore the validity of the
approximations we made in its derivation. We focus here on the energy spectra, so as to capture possible
deﬁciency of our model regarding energy transfer between scales. The test is performed for 1 < t < 2 (all
the simulations are initialized with the same ﬁeld at t=1). By that time, the kinetic energy is divided by
a factor of approximately 2. The energy spectra at time t = 2 are shown in ﬁg. 1.

Figure 1: Energy spectra of the RDT Models (5) and the equivalent DNS at t = 2 of simulations of decaying
turbulence (the RDT simulation is initialized with the velocity ﬁeld of the DNS at t=1)

The model (RDT) and the DNS agree at the largest scales (k < 3) but they signiﬁcantly diﬀer for
smaller scales (the bump at k=21 is due to the coupling between the equation for resolved scales and
the equation for subﬁlter scales running in parallel). This can be explained through the analysis of the
evolution of l (ﬁg. 2).

One sees that the RDT model leads to a constant increase of the smallest modes of l in time. After a
given period of time, the contribution of these unrealistic resolved scales of l inﬂuence the model of the
velocity ﬁeld resolved scales.

An explanation of this feature can be found following a recent study of the RDT model (2) [12]
showing that the process of small-scale stretching by random large scales is akin to a dynamo process,
with exponential increase of the small-scale energy. A way to stabilize the system is to include a friction
term in the RDT equation, leading to a stationary energy spectrum with index depending on the friction
time τf . A Kolmogorov k−5/3 spectrum is obtained for τf = 27/22 Ω, where Ω =
is a
typical stretching rate based on spatial average of the large-scale velocity stress tensor Sij . Using eq.
(3), one sees that such a friction term generates an equivalent friction term in the equation for the Lamb
l/τf in the equation for l
vector. This remark motivates the introduction of a stabilizing friction term
to try and stabilize the coupled system. Indeed one observes a signiﬁcant improvement with respect to

the original RDT model. We therefore adopt this procedure as our starting RDT model, from which we
now build our Langevin-LES model.

2.3 Derivation of the model

The derivation of the LES-Langevin model of turbulence proceeds in two steps.
In the ﬁrst one, we
)u′ into a turbulent viscous term µt∆U, acting only at large scales, in the spirit of
replace the term (u′
standard deterministic ”eddy-viscosity” models. In a second step, we derive a suitable Langevin equation
of the turbulent force l through a decimation of the number of degrees of freedom corresponding to scales
beyond the aliasing limit. For this, we introduce a strong hyperviscosity to damp all components beyond
a given cut-oﬀ wavenumber km. There is a priori complete freedom for the choice of km. Here, we note
that the cascade-driven forcing f has components only up to k = 2kc. Therefore, any component of
l beyond 3kc will only be generated through secondary processes (stretching) rather than through the
forcing. We may then hope that any km between 2kc and 3kc provides the dominant contribution to the
stochastic term l. We found that km = 2kc is in fact suﬃcient to capture this dominant contribution.
Our Langevin-LES (LRDT) model is therefore ﬁnally given by:

The RDT-based model we described is fully dynamics, and a priori adapted to any type of geometry,

approximations, enabling a reduction in the computation cost. We present two examples below.

2.4.1 Quasi-linear approximation (LQL)

In the spirit of quasi-linear approximation, we may lump the transport and stretching by resolved scales
l/τ , where τ is a
with the viscous and friction term and simply replace them by a total friction term
typical time scale to be chosen later.

−

Note that this simpliﬁcation somehow relies on the hypothesis that the advection and stretching of l
by the resolved scales proceeds in an isotropic manner. We therefore do not expect this simple procedure
to be fully valid in cases with e.g. stratiﬁcation, or rotation, or walls. In the present case, it appears to
give very good results, provided the time scale is chosen appropriately. This model therefore looks like:

2.4.2 The over-damped approximation (LQLOD)

In situation where the time scale τ is very small, the damping in the Langevin equation is very large, and
there is almost instantaneous adjustment of l to the forcing. This situation typically arises in locations
where the resolved gradients are very large, i.e;. at the border of coherent resolved eddies. It is therefore
interesting to run the model in this over-damped limit, to see whether these kinds of event dominate the
overall dynamics. The resulting model (Langevin Quasi-Linear Over-Damped) looks like:

)U + l =

∇

Through this approximation, our model, based on the estimation of l, becomes equivalent to the ADM
velocity-estimation model of Domaradzki and collaborators [7, 5, 8].
In a recent improvement of this
model, the estimated small scales are used to integrate the Navier-Stokes equation on the ﬁne grid over
a given period of time short enough to prevent the pile up of the energy at the ﬁnest scales. The ADM
model can therefore be viewed as a special case of our Langevin model. In the following, we show that
this approximation perform very well and is indistinguishable from the general model in the isotropic
homogeneous case. However, it may not be the case in more general situations, such as near walls. We
leave this for future work.

2.5 Parameters

Our model includes three parameters Tij, τ and µt, that we now discuss. As previously discussed, the
stochastic correlation Tij comes from pressure contribution, and we found its inﬂuence be irrelevant in
the case with periodic boundary condition. In the present study, we therefore adopt Tij = 0, leaving its
, so as to allow spatial
study for cases involving walls. For the time scale, we set τ = τf + α (Sij Sij)
variation of the friction time scale in agreement with local stretching. Alternatively, one may also use a
global friction time by considering only spatial average of the local stretching rate, so that τ = τm = βτf .
This last prescription is actually better in term of computational cost. Empirically, we found that both
prescriptions lead to a good model. In our numerical tests, we chose α = 1 or β = 1/2 but we checked
that the results are not very sensitive to these parameters

−1/2

For the turbulent viscosity, we have an a priori rather vast choice, ranging from spectral to Smagorinsky
models. In the present case, where our numerical scheme uses fast Fourier transform, the optimal choice
(in term of computational cost) is the spectral model. The simplest choice is to link the turbulent viscosity
E(kc)/kc). The proportionality factor is tuned
in our model and our numerical tests. Since part of the dissipation is produced by l, the proportionality
constant turns out to be reduced from 0.267 for the original spectral model (see [21]) to 0.08 in our case.
Summarizing, we get the following parameters for our models:

Models using the second prescription for the time scale will be called Langevin Quasi Linear Averaged

3 Model performances

3.1 Comparison of the Langevin models

As a preliminary assessment of the interest of our model, we choose to test it in a simple conﬁguration
where we have both the code and the competence to implement it over a short time scale. This case corre-
sponds to homogeneous, isotropic turbulence with periodic boundary conditions. It is clearly a restricted
problem, where backscatter has proved to be secondary, and where eddy-viscosity based approaches per-
form very satisfactorily. In some sense, this ideal case is therefore a challenge to our model, for it is not
clear whether there is room for further improvement with respect to eddy-viscosity description. In the
following, we demonstrate a slight but discernible positive eﬀect of our strategy.

The test is done both on decaying turbulence and forced turbulence in order to check the model abil-
ity to accurately reproduce the energy cascade from resolved to unresolved scales. The ﬁrst comparison
between the LRDT model (eq. 6) and the DNS is conducted over the energy spectra in ﬁg. 3 and the
decay of the total kinetic energy in ﬁg. 4.
In this comparison, the resolved scale turbulent viscosity µt
is tuned to give the best result in terms of energy spectra and decay of kinetic energy. The decimation
of the small-scale of l (so as to keep only 2kc modes in each direction) is done through an hyper-viscosity
(νt = 0.002 k2
E(kc)/kc) super-seeding the turbulent viscosity of the original RDT model. The energy
spectra are in good agreement with the DNS for t < 1 and slightly diﬀer for the smallest resolved scales
at later time. We are conﬁdent that a more elaborate tuning of the viscosity and friction term could have
improved the model over later time, but such accuracy was not needed in the sequel.

model (with kc = 21, km = 2kc) and the Smagorinsky model with kc = 42. The time t = 10 correspond to a
non-dimensional time of 6.3

The same numerical tests have been performed for the approximate models, LQL and LQLOD, (ﬁgs.
5 and 6), with the same deﬁnition of the time scale τ (eq. (10),(11)). The results are slightly less accurate
than the original LRDT model, but the two approximated models represent a good compromise between
accuracy and CPU cost. As discussed in the previous section, an alternative model to LQL can also
be formulate using an averaged value τm of the time scale τ . A comparison of averaged energy spectra
between LQL and LQLA models and DNS is done ﬁg. 7 for a simulation of forced homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. In the simulation with LQLA model, the averaged value of the time scale τm is of the order
of 0.1 turnover time. The two LES simulations are very similar and are both in good agreement with the
DNS.

3.2 Energy transfer

One of the ability of the model compared to eddy viscosity model is to allow energy transfer from subﬁlter
scales to resolved scales through the model of the cross stress tensor by the Langevin equation of l. The
amount of backscatter can be quantify by:

Tres,sub(k) =

U(p)l⊥(q)δ(k

Z Z

q)d3pd3q

p

−

−

(13)

The integration of Tres,sub(k) over a shell leads to the energy transfer as a function of the k. This quantity
was investigated for the LQLA model in the case of forced isotropic turbulence (see ﬁg. 8). The intensity
of the energy transfer through the Lamb vector T LQLA
res,sub(k) is compared with the energy transfer from
resolved scales T LQLA
res,res(k) and the energy dissipation introduced by the model of the Reynolds stress tensor
with a turbulent viscosity T LQLA
sub,sub(k). Each component of the energy transfer is also compared with the
equivalent component computed from the DNS. The statistics have been conducted over 4 turnover times
after stabilization of the statistics. The corresponding average energy spectra of the two simulations are
shown in Fig. 9. Since the two solutions used for the statistics diﬀer in time, it is diﬃcult to compare
exactly the transfer between the model and the DNS. However one can compare the sign and the order
of magnitude of each component. The transfer coming from the Lamb vector exhibits a small amount
of backscatter, which is not present in the DNS. However the transfer is very comparable at higher
wavenumbers. The turbulent viscosity µt used to model the Reynolds stress tensor leads to a dissipation
of energy higher than the equivalent energy transfer from the DNS. The model of this term could probably
be improved.

3.3 Comparison with other LES models

Within the present framework (isotropic, homogeneous turbulence) it therefore seems that the LQLA
model represents the best compromise in terms of accuracy and CPU cost. We now explore its perfor-
mances with respect to other classical LES models in this ﬁeld.

The simpler LES models for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence are based on eddy-viscosity concept,
namely the Smagorinsky model [34] and the spectral model [21]. The later has only been tested for forced
isotropic turbulence. The former corresponds to a Smagorinsky model (without dynamical procedure) in
which the constant was tuned to get the best results in terms of energy decay. It was run on the ﬁnest
grid of our model (the grid used for the integration of l). The comparison is done using several statistical
diagnostic, tracing diﬀerent properties of the model.

3.3.1 Energy spectra

A comparison of the energy spectra for these two models and our LQLA model is shown in ﬁg. 10 for
the decaying case and in ﬁg. 9 for the forced case. In the decaying case, our Langevin model performed
at least as well as the Smagorinsky model in terms of energy decay. In the forced case, the Smagorinsky
model clearly overestimate the energy dissipation at the smallest resolved scales, resulting in an energy
spectrum much steeper than the theoretical
5/3 slopes. Similar result is found for the spectral model,
while the LQLA model compares much better with the DNS at all scales. Indeed, our model seems to
model properly the energy transfer at the largest scales and the energy dissipation near the cut-oﬀ.

3.3.2 Skewness and ﬂatness

We also compared the skewness and the ﬂatness of the LES models to the same statistics for the corre-
sponding scales of the DNS in the case of forced turbulence. The results are displayed in table 1. The
LQLA model gives a correct sign of the skewness, with a value three times too large, and a correct esti-
mate of the ﬂatness. By comparison, the Smagorinsky model predicts a wrong sign for the skewness and
underestimates slightly the ﬂatness. The spectral model gives the best estimate of the skewness (with
correct sign) and underestimates the ﬂatness of the distribution.

3.3.3 Probability distribution function

A more reﬁned statistical comparison can be performed using the Probability Density Function of the
velocity increment δvr = (v(x + r) + v(x)) (ﬁgs. 11 and 12). Because of the coarse resolution of the LES
simulations and the small number of statistics for the equivalent scales of DNS, the diﬀerences of PDFs
between the models and the DNS are diﬃcult to observe. However, the statistics with the LQLA model
seems to be in a closer agreement with the DNS for both longitudinal and transverse velocity increment
than the two other dissipative models.

3.3.4 Statistics of invariants

A diﬀerent statistical test can also be performed on the tensor of velocity gradient tensor Aij = ∂ui/∂xj.
We choose to focus on the two following invariants:

3.3.5 Strain statistics

Another important characteristic of the strain rate tensor S is the statistics of its eigenvalues. To quantify
it, Lund and Rogers [24] proposed the following parameter:

s

where α, β and γ are the eigenvalues of S such as α < β < γ. The term s∗ measure the shape of the
deformation caused by the strain rate tensor, with s∗ =
1, 0, 1 corresponding respectively to worms,
shear and pancakes. The probability density function of s∗ for the resolved scales of the LQLA model as
well as for the Smagorinsky and the spectral models are computed in the case of forced turbulence. The
comparison is shown on ﬁgure 14. The comparison shows very good agreement for both the LQLA model
and the spectral model with respect to the DNS, while the Smagorinsky model shows poorer agreement.

3.3.6 Computational cost

The performance of each model can also be analyzed with respect to its computational cost. However,
we are not able to give precise estimations of the performance because the implementation of each model
was not optimized in terms of CPU cost. Moreover, the cost is highly related to the type of discretization
and the numerical scheme. But, looking at the equations, we can expect an optimal computational cost
for our model to be of the order of a DNS on a grid corresponding to the grid used for the integration
of l. It as been shown that an integration with wavenumbers up to 2kc is enough for the equation of l.
With the over-damped version of the model, there is no integration for l and we could expect a gain of a
factor 2 relative to the time step.

4 Discussion

In this work, we present a new strategy to model subﬁlter scale in a Large-Eddy-Simulation. Our phi-
losophy derives from the Brownian motion, where the extra degrees of freedom are modeled through the
combination of a deterministic friction and stochastic forcing. Our model therefore includes both a de-
terministic eddy-viscosity and a stochastic turbulent force, solution of a generalized Langevin equation.

15

Through this combination, we aim at reproducing both the transport enhancement through turbulent
motions, and stochastic energy backscatter from subﬁlter to resolved scale. Several model have been
proposed in the past, to reproduce these two eﬀects. At this point, it is interesting to review brieﬂy the
most popular ones, so as to understand their limitations and diﬀerences with respect to our model. A ﬁrst
example is the similarity model, which does not assume the alignment of the turbulent stress tensor with
the strain rate tensor. In the original model of Bardina [1], the model of the Reynolds stress is achieved
through approximation of the unﬁltered velocity by the ﬁltered velocity. This model can be seen as the
zero-level of more general deconvolution models that rebuilds the unﬁltered velocity (see [14] for a dis-
cussion on de-ﬁltering in LES). This procedure however is also subject to serious limitations, since a LES
with an exact deconvolution of the velocity ﬁeld would lead to a simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation
on a coarse grid without any model but with a sharp ﬁlter. Practically, the resulting lack of dissipation is
provided through the physical or the numerical approximations of the deconvolution [35]. Other concepts
arose from a detailed analysis of the energy transfer between resolved and subﬁlter scales. This leads to
the conclusion that the scales smaller than half the smallest resolved scales have only few impact on the
direct energy transfer to the largest scales [6, 40, 4]. Following this observation, a new method to capture
the backscatter has been proposed through direct estimation or a more accurate integration of the largest
subﬁlter-scales velocities. The simulations with these models can be accurate but expensive LES or cheap
approximated DNS. The dynamics multilevel model [10, 36, 9] is an example of cheap DNS as it requires
the same resolution as the corresponding DNS. Our 2D version of the RDT model [19] using a Lagrangian
evolution of small-scale wave-packets is more ﬂexible since the accuracy of the model is function of the
number of modes used for the subﬁlter scales. Better performances in terms of computational cost can be
obtained in models where only the largest unresolved scales are estimated. An example is provided by the
ADM model of Domaradzki [7, 5, 8], where subﬁlter scales are estimated on a ﬁner grid. The estimation
of subﬁlter scales is performed after a ﬁrst step of deconvolution. In a recent improvement of this model
the estimated small scales are used to integrate the Navier Stokes equation on the ﬁne grid over a given
period of time short enough to prevent the pile up of the energy at the ﬁnest scales. Finally, one may note
that attempt of direct inclusion of the backscatter have been done in the past through empirical addition
of random numbers, with well chosen spectrum [20, 25]. These models led to noticeable improvement
with respect to eddy-viscosity type of approach for boundary layer or plane shear mixing layer.

Most of these models have been validated and compared in several ﬂow conﬁgurations. The most
intensive comparison have been performed for isotropic turbulence where the DNS can reach higher
Reynolds number. For instance, Fureby et al [13] made a comparative study of subgrid scale model of
eddy-viscosity type, models of similarity type and Miles model. For moderate Reynolds number, they
concluded that the diﬀerence between LES with diﬀerent models are small but not insigniﬁcant. The
characteristics of more speciﬁc type of models like eddy-viscosity models or similarity models have been
studied intensively by many authors ([23, 27, 22]

From this review, it is clear that our originality is to seek for a systematic derivation of the stochastic
eﬀect, rooted in the Navier-Stokes dynamics. By this mean, we hope both to avoid uncontrolled, empirical
modeling, and respect of all the symmetries of the original Navier-Stokes equation (a constraint not always
easy to respect, see [29]). Our model may also easily be generalized to other more complicated systems,
like e.g. rotating, stratiﬁed or inhomogeneous turbulence. Speciﬁcally, we separate the subﬁlter scale
contribution into a term that correlates well to resolved strain tensors, and a term susceptible to the
backscatter. The ﬁrst term is modeled through a traditional eddy-viscosity, while the second is modeled
through a noise, obeying a generalized Langevin equation. This equation is not postulated, but derived
from the Navier-Stokes equation, through hypothesis akin to rapid distortion theory. The stochastic retro-
action couples the resolved scales and the noise through the energy cascade, ensuring strong non-linearity
of our model and non-trivial equilibrium solutions. A corner stone of our model is the estimation of l,
rather than the velocity, like in ADM model. Apart from this diﬀerence, there is some similarity between
our model and the ADM model, in the simplest approximations we considered (quasi-linear and over-
damped approximation). However, our model derives from the original Navier-Stokes equation through a
well-deﬁned and systematic procedure.

We have proposed a preliminary test of our model in isotropic, homogeneous situation, with periodic
boundary conditions. In this case where the backscatter is secondary, we have shown that our model
still perform slightly better than traditional LES approach used in this situation, based on eddy-viscosity
concept.
It would now be interesting to test our model in more realistic situations, with boundaries,
where the stochastic modeling will become an essential ingredient. Given that our model reduces to the
ADM model in a well-deﬁned limit, we are conﬁdent that it can perform as well as this last model. The
interesting question is whether our dynamical procedure increases its performance, and overcome certain
limitations of the ADM model. This will be the subject of a future work.

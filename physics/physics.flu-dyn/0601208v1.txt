Abstract

Energy theory for incompressible Newtonian ﬂuids is, in many cases, capable of producing
strong absolute stability criteria for steady ﬂows. In those ﬂuids the kinetic energy naturally
deﬁnes a norm in which perturbations decay monotonically in time at suﬃciently low (but non-
zero) Reynolds numbers. There are, however, at least two obstructions to the generalization
of such methods to Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. One previously recognized problem is the fact that the
natural energy does not correspond to a proper functional norm on perturbations. Another
problem, original to this work, is the fact that ﬂuctuations in Oldroyd-B ﬂuids may be subject
to non-normal ampliﬁcation at arbitrarily low Reynolds numbers (albeit at suﬃciently large
Weissenberg numbers). Such transient growth, occuring even when the base ﬂow is linearly
stable, precludes the uniform monotonic decay of any reasonable measure of the disturbance’s
amplitude.

Keywords: Energy stability, planar shear ﬂow, viscoelastic ﬂow

Introduction

Linear stability theory can predict suﬃcient conditions for instability, but some sort of nonlinear
analysis is necessary to determine stability against ﬁnite amplitude perturbations. In many ﬂuid
dynamic systems the notion of nonlinear energy stability is useful for determining conditions for
absolute stability [1, 2]. Energy stability theory exploits the observation that physically natural
energy functionals may generate norms that can be used to measure the amplitude of disturbances
about a base ﬂow. Energy analysis typically leads to suﬃcient conditions for the norms of arbitrary
amplitude disturbances to decay monotonically in time, a very strong notion of absolute stability.
For example, steady states of incompressible Newtonian ﬂuids are very generally energy stable
at suﬃciently low Reynolds numbers. In some cases, notably simple Rayleigh-Benard convection
problems in the Boussinesq approximation, the critical Rayleigh numbers for energy stability and
linear instability coincide to establish the supercritical nature of the bifurcation point [3]. Moreover,
energy methods can be generalized to derive rigorous bounds on ﬂow quantities for high Reynolds
(or Rayleigh) number steady, unsteady and even turbulent ﬂows [4, 5, 6].

Elastic and kinetic energy budgets have been used frequently in the past for the linear stability
analysis of dilute polymer solutions in simple ﬂow geometries. Purely elastic instabilities at small
Reynolds numbers were analyzed by Joo and Shaqfeh [7] (a review can be found in [8]) for an
Oldroyd-B ﬂuid in a Taylor-Couette geometry. In the total disturbance energy balance, coupling
between perturbations of the velocity ﬁeld and gradients of the polymer stress showed the same
temporal growth as the kinetic energy of ﬂow and were thus identiﬁed as the ones causing the
instability. Similar energy budget considerations were applied and extended by Sureshkumar for
linear stability analysis of plane Poiseuille ﬂows at larger Reynolds number [9] where the impor-
tance of this coupling was conﬁrmed. For growing Weissenberg numbers the coupling of velocity
perturbations to gradients of normal viscoelastic stresses was found to dominate the destabilization.

In this paper we investigate the notion of nonlinear energy stability for Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. To
set the stage and ﬁx notation, ﬁrst recall the case of plane Couette ﬂow of a Newtonian ﬂuid. The
ﬂuid is conﬁned between parallel horizontal plates at y = 0 and y = ℓ, with the lower plate at
rest and the upper plate moving in the x-direction (i) with velocity U . For simplicity, we consider
periodic conditions in the streamwise (i) and cross-stream (k) directions. Measuring length in units
of ℓ and time in units of ℓ/U , the velocity vector ﬁeld u(x, t) = iu + jv + kw of an incompressible
Newtonian ﬂuid satisﬁes the Navier-Stokes equations

This is the sense in which plane Couette ﬂow is absolutely stable to arbitrary (ﬁnite energy)
disturbances when Re < ReES. Plane Couette ﬂow is linearly stable at all Re [11], but ﬁnite
amplitude disturbances may not decay suﬃciently high above the energy stability limit. Non-normal
ampliﬁcation of small disturbances, a transient growth phenomenon available even in linearly stable
systems, is recognized as an eﬀective mechanism for stimulating ﬁnite-amplitude instabilities [10,
12].

In the following sections we address the question of whether or not this notion of energy sta-
bility may be fruitfully generalized to Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. There have been previous analyses in this
direction for other non-Newtonian constitutive relations [13], and a priori energy estimates for
Oldroyd-B ﬂuids [14], but to our knowledge there has been no deﬁnitive determination of whether
an energy stability principle exists for Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. Here we show by example that no such
principle is possible in general for Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. By examining particular exact solutions to
the full nonlinear equations of motion we determine that some perturbations will grow, absorbing
energy from the base ﬂow, even at arbitrarily small (but nonvanishing) Reynolds numbers.

expressing the net balance between dissipation (the ﬁrst two negative terms on the right hand side)
and the work done on the ﬂuid by the agency imposing the boundary condition (the indeﬁnite
surface integral of the stresses).

Two distinct obstructions stand in the way of attempts to generalize the property of energy
stability to Oldroyd-B ﬂuids. The ﬁrst problem is evident already in (13): while the kinetic
energy deﬁnes a natural norm on the velocity ﬁeld, the polymer energy does not correspond to
a norm (or even a metric) on the polymer stress ﬁeld [14]. Indeed, the physically relevant space
for the polymer conﬁguration tensor c is the set of positive symmetric matrices, but this does not
constitute a linear vector space. So strictly speaking the concept of a norm is not meaningful. More
importantly, though, while it is true that for positive symmetric matrices tr(c) = 0 implies c = 0,
the trace does not satisfy a triangle inequality necessary for a metric. It is clear, then, that the
most straightforward generalization of energy stability will not work for Oldroyd-B ﬂuids.

Nevertheless, various norms or metrics can be deﬁned on perturbations (δu, δτ ) of the variables.

For example, an L2 norm could be deﬁned by

could be used as an eﬀective measure of the amplitude of perturbations. In any case there is a second
fundamental—in this case dynamical—obstruction to a principle of energy stability in Oldroyd-B
ﬂuids: As will be shown in the next section, the problem is that it is possible for perturbations to
absorb energy from a base ﬂow and, by any reasonable measure, grow at arbitrarily low Re. That
is, it is not possible to assert in any generality that there is an analog of energy stability in the sense
that there is a positive critical value ReES so that Re < ReES implies that all perturbations decay
monotonically. This “no-go” result is established by producing speciﬁc examples where disturbances
do not decay monotonically at arbitrarily low Re.

3 Some exact solutions in the Couette geometry

Plane Couette ﬂow uCouette = iy is an exact solution of the Oldroyd-B equations (8-10) in the plane
shear geometry when augmented with the constant (in space and time) polymer stress tensor

This ﬂow is linearly stable for upper convected Maxwell ﬂuids [15], i.e., when s =

where, preserving the symmetry, δc12 = δc21. That is, we look for solutions where the polymer
stress tensor is a function of time, but not space, so there is no inﬂuence of the polymers back
onto the ﬂow ﬁeld. For this class of solutions there are no perturbations of the velocity ﬁeld or the
Newtonian stress.

Inserting this ansatz into the full nonlinear equations of motion produces an exact closed set of

linear ordinary diﬀerential equations for the components of δc:

The general solutions, uniform in Re, are

These solutions display non-normal transient growth for a variety of initial data as long as W i

is not too small. For example consider the zero energy (i.e, trace δτ (0) = 0) perturbation

where 0 < a < 1. The time-dependent perturbation of the conformation tensor is then

factor at large W i—before reassuming the stationary conﬁguration. During the period of tran-
sient growth, the polymers absorb energy from the background shear ﬂow faster than the elastic

4 Summary and discussion

The conventional notion of energy stability of a stationary ﬂow implies monotonic decay of some
meaningful measure of the magnitude of arbitrary amplitude disturbances. The exact solutions
developed in the preceeding section show that it is generally not possible to establish monotonic
decay of arbitrary perturbations of steady ﬂows of Oldroyd-B ﬂuids at ﬁnite Reynolds numbers.
These examples require a nonvanishing (and not arbitrarily small) Weissenberg number so there
must be some nonvanishing shear in the base ﬂow, but the observed transient ampliﬁcation of
(W i2) in magnitude, are uniform in the ﬂuid’s kinematic viscosity and Re.
perturbations, up to
While a base ﬂow may be linearly stable, the ‘extra’ degrees of freedom in the polymers may allow
for exact solutions displaying non-normal transient growth.

We remark that the problems extending energy stability techniques pointed out here are not
mitigated by using another physically motivated energy functional where a thermodynamic free
energy takes the place of the mechanical elastic energy alone [16]. That is, a free energy density of
the form

(33)

includes entropic eﬀects so that the free energy minimum is precisely the equilibrium polymer
conﬁguration with cij = δij. However this still does not induce a proper metric or norm on
conﬁgurations and because it does not aﬀect the equations of motion, the non-normal growth
phenomena and the obstructions it presents are still present.

Finally, after this work was completed we became aware of the analysis of Morozov and van
Saarloos [17] on an elastic ﬁnite-amplitude instability for suﬃciently high Weissenberg number
and arbitrarily low Reynolds number. That work goes beyond the observations presented here by
explicitly displaying an additional stationary solution to the fully nonlinear 3-d equations.

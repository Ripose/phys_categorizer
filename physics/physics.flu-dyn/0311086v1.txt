Abstract

This paper extends the derivation of the Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE-
α) equations to the case of barotropic compressible ﬂows. The aim of La-
grangian averaging is to regularize the compressible Euler equations by adding
dispersion instead of artiﬁcial viscosity. Along the way, the derivation of the
isotropic and anisotropic LAE-α equations is simpliﬁed and clariﬁed.

The derivation in this paper involves averaging over a tube of trajectories
ηǫ centered around a given Lagrangian ﬂow η. With this tube framework,
the Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE-α) equations are derived by following a
simple procedure: start with a given action, Taylor expand in terms of small-
scale ﬂuid ﬂuctuations ξ, truncate, average, and then model those terms that
are nonlinear functions of ξ. Closure of the equations is provided through the
use of ﬂow rules, which prescribe the evolution of the ﬂuctuations along the
mean ﬂow.

Historical Remarks. The incompressible case will be discussed ﬁrst. The La-
grangian averaged Euler (LAE-α) equations for average incompressible ideal ﬂuid
motion ﬁrst appeared in the context of averaged ﬂuid models in Holm, Marsden, and Ratiu
[1998a,b]. Dissipation was added later to produce the Lagrangian averaged Navier-
Stokes (LANS-α) equations, also known as the Navier-Stokes-α equations1.

Remarkably, the LANS-α equations are mathematically identical to the inviscid
second grade ﬂuid equations introduced in Rivlin and Erickson [1955], except for
the fact that the parameter α is interpreted diﬀerently in the two theories. In the
case of LAE-α and LANS-α, the parameter α is a spatial scale below which rapid
ﬂuctuations are smoothed by linear and nonlinear dispersion.

As in, for example, the work of Whitham [1974] on nonlinear waves, the distinc-
tive feature of the Lagrangian averaging approach is that averaging is carried out
at the level of the variational principle and not at the level of the Euler or Navier-
Stokes equations, which is the traditional averaging or ﬁltering approach used for
both the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and the large eddy simulation
(LES) models. As such, the variational procedure does not add any artiﬁcial viscos-
ity, a physical reason to consider the LAE-α or LANS-α equations as good models
for incompressible turbulent ﬂow. Moreover, it has been proven that the α models
are computationally very attractive (see Chen, Holm, Margolin, and Zhang [1999];
Mohseni, Kosovi´c, Shkoller, and Marsden [2003]).

Although sharing the same general technique (use of averaging and asymptotic
methods in the variational formulation), several alternative derivations of incom-
pressible LAE-α equations exist in the literature. One of these derivations (see
Holm [1999]) uses the generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory developed in
Andrews and McIntyre [1978].

An alternative derivation of the incompressible LAE-α and LANS-α equations
was given in Marsden and Shkoller [2003] by using an ensemble average over the set
of solutions of the Euler equations with initial data in a phase-space ball of radius
α, while treating the dissipative term via stochastic variations. The derivation also
uses a turbulence closure that is based on the Lagrangian ﬂuctuations, namely a
generalization of the frozen turbulence hypothesis of Taylor (see Taylor [1938]).

and not the volume preserving ones (see Holm and Marsden [2004]).

Rigorous analysis aimed at proving global well-posedness and regularity of the
three-dimensional isotropic and anisotropic LANS-α equations can be found in, for
example, Foias, Holm, and Titi [2002]; Marsden and Shkoller [2001, 2003]. However,
global existence for the inviscid three-dimensional Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE-
α) remains an open problem.

From a computational viewpoint, numerical simulations of the α models (see
Chen, Holm, Margolin, and Zhang [1999]; Mohseni, Kosovi´c, Shkoller, and Marsden
[2003]) show that the LANS-α equations give comparable computational savings as
LES models for forced and decaying turbulent ﬂows in periodic domains. For wall-
bounded ﬂows, it is expected that either the anisotropic model or a model with
varying α needs to be used; the computational eﬃcacy of these methods on such
ﬂows remains to be demonstrated.

As far as the compressible case is concerned, the only reference we know of is
Holm [2002a]. We shall discuss the relation between the work in this reference and
the present paper below.

We refer the interested reader to Marsden and Shkoller [2001, 2003] for a more
detailed history of the PDE analysis for LAE-α and LANS-α equations and to
Mohseni, Kosovi´c, Shkoller, and Marsden [2003] for a survey and further references
about the numerical aspects of these models.

Motivation.
In compressible ﬂows there are two major problems at higher wave
numbers, or small scales, that require special attention. These are (a) turbulence
for high Reynolds number ﬂows (common with incompressible ﬂows) and (b) strong
shocks. In both cases the challenge lies in the appropriate representation of small
scale eﬀects. For turbulence, the energy cascade to smaller scales can be balanced
by viscous dissipation, resulting in the viscous regularization of the Euler equations.
Historically, viscous dissipation has been used to regularize shock discontinuities.
This includes adding to the Euler equation non-physical and artiﬁcial viscous terms
and Fourier’s law for heat transfer in the shock region (see e.g., Liepmann and Roshko
[1957]; Shapiro [1953]). This way, the steepening eﬀect of the nonlinear convective
term is balanced by dissipation. We believe that Lagrangian averaging is a rea-
sonable alternative way to regularize shock waves. The net eﬀect of Lagrangian
averaging is to add dispersion instead of dissipation to the Euler equations; that
is, one adds terms that redistribute energy in a nonlinear fashion. In other, rather
diﬀerent situations, the technique of balancing a nonlinear convective term by dis-
persive mechanisms was used by Lax and Levermore [1983] for the KdV equation
and by Kawahara [1970]; Kakutani and Kawahara [1970] for plasma ﬂows.

The competition between nonlinearity and dispersion has of course resulted in re-
markable discoveries, the most famous of being solitons, localized waves that collide
elastically, suﬀering only a shift in phase. The robustness of solitons in overcoming
strong perturbations is largely due to a balance between nonlinearity and linear
dispersion. Note that in Lagrangian averaging, the energy redistribution mecha-
nism that is introduced is nonlinear and might yield other interesting features that
warrant further investigation.

Another feature of the Compressible Lagrangian Averaged Navier-Stokes-α equa-

1 Introduction

tions (or CLANS-α equations) is that in turbulent ﬂows with shocks, the eﬀect of
shocks and turbulence are simultaneously modeled by the same technique, namely
the Lagrangian averaging method.

Issues Addressed in This Paper.
In this paper we apply the averaged La-
grangian methodology to derive the isotropic and anisotropic averaged models for
compressible Euler equations.

One goal of this paper is to present a clear derivation of the averaged equations.
We are particularly interested in separating the two issues of averaging and modeling.
In the derivation, a new ensemble averaging technique is proposed and investigated.
Instead of taking clouds of initial conditions, as in Marsden and Shkoller [2003], we
average over a tube of trajectories ηǫ centered around a given Lagrangian ﬂow η.
The tube is constructed by specifying the Lagrangian ﬂuctuations ξǫ = ηǫ ◦ η−1 at
t = 0 and providing a ﬂow rule which evolves them to all later times. The choice of
ﬂow rule is a precise modeling assumption which brings about closure of the system.
For the incompressible case we assume that ﬂuctuations are Lie advected by
the mean ﬂow (or frozen into the mean ﬂow as divergence-free vector ﬁelds), and
we obtain both the isotropic and the anisotropic versions of the LAE-α equations.
The advection hypothesis is the natural extension to vector ﬁelds of the classical
Frozen Turbulence Hypothesis of G.I. Taylor (see Taylor [1938]) stated for scalar
ﬂuctuations.

The second goal of this work is to extend the derivation to barotropic compress-
ible ﬂows. This problem has already been considered by Holm (see Holm [2002a])
in the context of generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) motion.
In this work, an
alpha model appears as a GLM ﬂuid theory with an appropriate Taylor hypothesis
closure. However, even though Holm [2002a] enumerates several frozen-in closure
hypotheses, the averaged equations are derived only for the case when the ﬂuctu-
ations are parallel transported by the mean ﬂow. In our work we will consider a
more general advection hypothesis to study the compressible anisotropic case. In
addition, a physically based new ﬂow rule is introduced to deal with the isotropic
case.

The averaging technique consists of expanding the original Lagrangian with re-
spect to a perturbation parameter ǫ, truncating the expansion to O(ǫ2) terms, and
then taking the average. It turns out that the averaged compressible Lagrangian de-
pends on the Lagrangian ﬂuctuations ξ′ only through three tensor quantities which
are quadratic in ξ′. In the terminology of Holm [2002a] these tensors represent the
second-order statistics of the Lagrangian ﬂuctuations. Evolution equations for these
tensors are derived from a core modeling assumption: a prescribed ﬂow rule for the
time-evolution of the ﬂuctuations ξ′. The ﬂow rule gives us closure, allowing us
to apply Hamilton’s principle to the averaged Lagrangian and thereby derive an
equation for the mean velocity u.

The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In §2 we describe a general
procedure for Lagrangian ensemble averaging. This procedure is then applied to the
action for incompressible ﬂuids in §3 to demonstrate our derivation technique. The
general procedure is applied again in §4, this time to the more complex case of

2 General Lagrangian Averaging

5

barotropic compressible ﬂuids. §5 is devoted to modeling issues; here the strategy
of modeling the evolution of Lagrangian ﬂuctuations ξ′ using ﬂow rules is discussed
in detail. In §6 we derive the averaged equations for incompressible and compressible
models in both isotropic and anisotropic versions. The Appendix provides technical
details about the ﬂuctuation calculus used throughout the paper.

Main Results. The main result of this paper is the derivation of compressible
Lagrangian-averaged Euler equations with

• anisotropic modeling of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations—see equations (6.2).

• isotropic modeling of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations—see equations (6.4).

In addition, we provide an improved derivation of the incompressible isotropic and
anisotropic LAE-α equations.

2 General Lagrangian Averaging

A mathematical setting for a certain class of compressible ﬂuid ﬂow problems will
ﬁrst be given. After describing the general procedure for Lagrangian averaging, the
speciﬁc case of the Euler action for ﬂuids will be considered.

Let M be an N dimensional manifold representing the containing space of a
ﬂuid. Suppose we are given a Lagrangian for a compressible ﬂuid, L(ψ, ˙ψ, µ0),
where ψ ∈ Diﬀ(M ) the space of diﬀeomorphisms of M , (ψ, ˙ψ) ∈ T Diﬀ(M ) and µ0 ∈
ΛN (M ), the space of N -forms on M . Fix a time interval [0, T ] and let C(Diﬀ(M ))
be the path space of smooth maps from [0, T ] into Diﬀ(M ). Then the action S :
C(Diﬀ(M )) × ΛN (M ) → R is

S(η, µ0) =

L(η(t), ˙η(t), µ0) dt.

We seek an averaged action Sα(η, µ0), where α is a length scale characterizing the
coarseness of the average. Taking η and µ0 as given, we shall describe how to
compute Sα(η, µ0).

It is important to emphasize that for both S and Sα, η is merely a test

curve. It is not an extremal of the action S. We are trying to average the action
S itself, not any ﬂuid dynamical PDE or the solutions of such a PDE. Our ﬁnal
product Sα should not depend at all on an initial choice of the test curve η.

Tube Initialization. The ﬁrst step is to take ξǫ(x, t) to be a family of diﬀeomor-
phisms about the identity. That is,

for each ǫ ≥ 0,

at ǫ = 0,

ξǫ(·, t) ∈ Diﬀ(M ) for all t, and
ξǫ(x, t) = x for all x, t.

Use ξǫ to construct a tube of material deformation maps that are close to η by
letting ηǫ(X, t) = ξǫ(η(X, t), t), or, written more compactly,

Here, X is a material point in the reference conﬁguration. Deﬁne the spatial veloc-
ity by uǫ(x, t) = ˙ηǫ((ηǫ)−1(x, t), t), where ηǫ is a given material deformation map.
Compactly written, this reads

ηǫ = ξǫ ◦ η.

uǫ = ˙ηǫ ◦ (ηǫ)−1.

The map uǫ is a time-dependent vector ﬁeld on M , i.e. for each ǫ ≥ 0, and for all t,
uǫ(·, t) ∈ X(M ).

Averaging. The existence of an averaging operation h · i will now be postulated.
The properties this operation is required to satisfy and an example of such an
operation will be given shortly.

Relationship Between uǫ and u.
It is desirable to have the ﬂuctuations ξǫ cen-
tered, on average, about the identity: hξǫ(x, t)i = x for all positions x at all times t.
What is actually needed is that for n ≥ 1,

(cid:12)

(cid:12)

In other words, the n-th order ﬂuid ﬂuctuation vector ﬁelds should all have mean
zero. Restricting the map to be centered about the identity means simply that the
average will not be skewed in an arbitrary direction. From (2.2) and (2.3) one can
derive

huǫ ◦ ξǫ(x, t)i = u(x, t).
Equation (2.4) shows in which sense the average of uǫ is u in a Lagrangian mean
theory deﬁned by hηǫ(·, t)i = η(·, t). This equation is closely connected with the
generalized Lagrangian-mean description of Andrews and McIntyre [1978], where
the Lagrangian mean velocity ¯uL and the ﬂuctuating Eulerian velocity uξ are related
in a similar way.

(2.4)

Density. For the non-averaged Lagrangian L, µ0 is a parameter in the sense of
Lagrangian semidirect product theory; see Marsden, Ratiu, and Weinstein [1984];
Holm, Marsden, and Ratiu [1998b]. The physical interpretation of µ0 is as follows.
Since µ0 is an N -form on M , it can be written as

µ0 = ρ0 dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxN

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

2 General Lagrangian Averaging

where ρ0 is a smooth function on M . Now ρ0(X) is the density of the ﬂuid at the
material point X in the reference conﬁguration. This is in contrast to the spatial
density ρǫ(x, t), which gives us the density of the ﬂuid at the spatial point x at time
t. Deﬁning

one has the relationship

µǫ = ρǫ dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxN ,

(ηǫ)∗µ0 = µǫ.

(2.5)

(2.6)

Fluctuation Calculus. Because uǫ and ρǫ will be expanded, the ǫ-derivatives of
uǫ and ρǫ need to be calculated. First, deﬁne

and

u′′ =

(2.7)

By diﬀerentiating (2.2), one ﬁnds expressions for u′ and u′′ in terms of u, ξ′, and ξ′′
. The calculations can be performed intrinsically using Lie derivative formulae —
the results, as found in Marsden and Shkoller [2003], are

u′ = ∂tξ′ + [u, ξ′],
u′′ = ∂tξ′′ + [u, ξ′′] − 2∇u′ · ξ′ − ∇∇u(ξ′, ξ′).

(2.8a)

(2.8b)

In these formulas, the bracket [x, y] = £xy is the standard Jacobi-Lie bracket of
vector ﬁelds on M (see, for example, Abraham, Marsden, and Ratiu [1988]). Next,
deﬁne

ρǫ,

and

ρ′′ =

ρǫ.

(2.9)

One obtains expressions for ρ′ and ρ′′ in terms of ρ, ξ′, and ξ′′ by diﬀerentiating
(2.6) (see the appendix for the detailed calculations). The results are:

Averaging Operation.
In the above development, an averaging operation has
been implicitly used. The properties it is required to satisfy will now be spelled
out. Let F(Y ) mean the space of smooth, real-valued functions on a manifold Y . If
Y is inﬁnite dimensional, then smoothness is understood in the sense of inﬁnite di-
mensional calculus with respect to, for example, suitable Sobolev topologies. These
inﬁnite dimensional technicalities will not be required in any detail in this paper,
and so may be treated formally.

As before, the manifold M is the containing space of the ﬂuid and α is a small
positive number. Let X be an appropriately chosen space of ﬁelds, designed to model
“ﬂuid ﬂuctuations,” on M , and consider the space Y = [0, α]×X. Assume that there
is an averaging operation

Here, ψh ∈ F(Y ) is deﬁned as the pointwise product. Note that if ψ is a

For compressible ﬂow, the space of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations is X = X(M ). For in-
compressible ﬂow, the space of divergence-free vector ﬁelds is used instead, i.e.
X = Xdiv(M ). In general, X = TIdentityX, where X is the space to which the tube
maps ξǫ belong.

Example. Let µ be a probability measure on the unit sphere S in X(M ), and
deﬁne the average of a (vector-valued) function f (ǫ, w) on [0, α] × S by

f (ǫ, w) dµ(w) dǫ.

One checks formally that this is an example of an averaging operation that

Incompressible Flow Revisited

Before applying the averaging technique to the case of compressible ﬂow, we shall
ﬁrst derive averaged equations for incompressible ﬂow, equations which have al-
ready been derived in the literature. The presentation given here has the advantage
of being easily generalized to compressible ﬂows. This advantage stems from the
careful use and interpretation of modeling assumptions on the ﬂuctuations ξ′ —
only intuitive assumptions are required regarding the mean behavior of the ﬂuctu-
ations as well as a ﬁrst-order Taylor hypothesis. Furthermore, great care has been
taken to separate the algebraic issues involved with the averaging procedure from
the modeling issues.

In the incompressible case, ﬂuid ﬂuctuations are modeled using the volume-
preserving diﬀeomorphism group on M which is denoted by Diﬀvol(M ). Therefore,
the tube construction from the previous section now reads: let ξǫ(x, t) be a family
of volume-preserving diﬀeomorphisms about the identity. That is,

for each ǫ ≥ 0,

at ǫ = 0,

ξǫ(·, t) ∈ Diﬀvol(M ) for all t, and
ξǫ(x, t) = x for all x, t.

This forces ξ′(·, t) to be a divergence-free vector ﬁeld for all t.

Zero-Mean Fluctuations. Before undertaking this computation, recall from §2
that the ﬂuctuation diﬀeomorphism maps ξǫ are required to have as their average the
identity map. This statistical assumption regarding the behavior of the ﬂuctuations
is the ﬁrst modeling assumption:

hξ′i = 0

and hξ′′i = 0.

(3.5)

This point would not be worth belaboring except that, when combined with the
properties of our averaging operation (2.11-2.14), assumption (3.5) forces all linear
functions of ξ′, ξ′′, and their derivatives to also have zero mean. Applying this fact
to (3.4) causes the entire O(ǫ) group and the second O(ǫ2) group to vanish inside
the average.

Modeling of ξ′.
Immediate application of Hamilton’s principle to (3.8) does not
yield a closed system of equations. Namely, we have initial (t = 0) data for ξ′ but
no way to compute this vector ﬁeld for t > 0. Our approach in what follows will be
to write down, based on physical considerations, an evolution law, or ﬂow rule, for
ξ′.

A ﬂow rule consists of a prescribed choice of φ in the following evolution equation

for ξ′:

Given a choice of ξ′ at t = 0, this equation will uniquely determine ξ′ for t > 0. Let
us assume we have a linear ﬂow rule,

Dξ′

= φ(u, ρ, ξ′).

Dξ′i

= Ωijξ′j,

where Ωij is allowed to depend on u and ρ but not on ξǫ or its derivatives. The
caveat here is that our choice of Ω must be compatible with incompressibility; in
particular, div ξ′ = 0 at t = 0, and Ω must be chosen such that ξ′ remains divergence
free as it evolves. At this stage, one might raise the issue of the tube ξǫ and request a
concrete description of the whole object. Such a description is unnecessary; in order
to close the system of evolution equations resulting from (3.8), we need only describe

(3.13)

Using the deﬁnition of the material derivative, it is trivial to see that this ﬂow
rule is equivalent to Lie advection of ξ′: ∂tξ′ = −£uξ′. This advection hypothesis
is the vector ﬁeld analogue of the classical Frozen Turbulence Hypothesis of G.I.
Taylor introduced in Taylor [1938]. This hypothesis is widely used in the turbulence
community (see Cocke [1969] for instance for usage of this hypothesis even in the
sense of Lie advection of vector ﬁelds). More recently, this generalized version of
Taylor hypothesis has been used to achieve turbulence closure in the derivation
of incompressible LAE-α equations (see Marsden and Shkoller [2001, 2003]) or in
the work of Holm (see Holm [2002a]) on averaged compressible models using the
generalized Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory.

The advection ﬂow rule (3.13) is perhaps the most obvious choice for Ω that is
compatible with incompressibility. Note that if div ξ′ = 0 at t = 0, then diﬀerenti-
ating (3.13) with respect to xi yields

Therefore, div ξ′ = 0 for all t > 0. Using this ﬂow rule, both anisotropic and
isotropic models shall be developed. For incompressible ﬂow, no other ﬂow rules
will be considered.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Incompressible, Anisotropic, Inhomogeneous Flow.
In this case, the ﬂow
rule is used to derive an evolution equation for the covariance tensor F . Time-
diﬀerentiating F ij = hξ′iξ′ji and using (3.13) yields the Lie advection equation
∂tF = −£uF . Equipped with an evolution equation for F , we can apply Hamilton’s
principle to (3.12) and derive a closed system with unknowns u, the average velocity,
and F , the covariance tensor.

Carrying this out, one ﬁnds that the anisotropic LAE-α equations are given by

the following coupled system of equations2 for u and F :

∂t(1 − α2C)u + (u · ∇)(1 − α2C)u = − grad p,

div u = 0,
∂tF + ∇F · u − F · ∇u − ∇uT · F = 0,

where p is the ﬂuid pressure, and the operator C is deﬁned by

Cu = div[∇u · F ].

(3.14a)

(3.14b)

(3.14c)

(3.15)

When α = 0, the system (3.14) reduces to the incompressible Euler equation.

space using standard Euclidean coordinates.

Note. Start with the generic incompressible averaged Lagrangian (3.12) and sub-
stitute the advection ﬂow rule (3.13). Now integrate the last term by parts and use
div ξ′ = 0. The result is

which is exactly the Lagrangian used in Marsden and Shkoller [2003] to derive the
anisotropic LAE-α equations. However, in Marsden and Shkoller [2003] the second-
order Taylor hypothesis

D

hξ′′i ⊥ u,

where the orthogonality is taken in L2, is necessary to achieve closure. Our choice
of modeling assumptions rendered unnecessary any such hypothesis on the second-
order ﬂuctuations ξ′′. Second-order Taylor hypotheses, unlike the ﬁrst-order hy-
pothesis retained from Marsden and Shkoller [2003], do not have much precedent in
the turbulence literature, as discussed above.

Incompressible, Isotropic, Homogeneous Fluids. To model the motion of
an approximately isotropic ﬂuid, we take the covariance tensor F to be the identity

The choice of F ij = δij is a modeling assumption, and will thus only be valid for
ﬂows which almost preserve this property. Note that (3.17) is strictly inconsistent
with the advection ﬂow rule, and thus can only be regarded as an approximation.

For the case of incompressible isotropic mean ﬂow, we assume that (3.17) holds;
then diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to xk and xj and using the fact that

This expression for the averaged Lagrangian in the isotropic case is identical to the

ciple or Euler-Poincar´e theory, we obtain the standard isotropic LAE-α equations:

∂t(1 − α2∆)u + (u · ∇)(1 − α2∆)u − α2(∇u)T · ∆u = − grad p,

div u = 0,

(3.21a)

(3.21b)

where p is the usual ﬂuid pressure.

4 Averaged Lagrangian for Compressible Flow

Having understood the incompressible case, we now turn to the compressible case.
The procedure is identical in all aspects except we must now keep track of density
ﬂuctuations. Start with the reduced Lagrangian for compressible ﬂow:

l(uǫ, ρǫ) =

kuǫk2 − W (ρǫ)

ρǫ dx.

(4.1)

ZM (cid:18)

(cid:19)

The ﬂuid is assumed to be barotropic, meaning that W , the potential energy, is a
function only of ρ, the ﬂuid density. Now expand the velocity and density in Taylor
series

uǫ = u + ǫu′ +

ǫ2u′′ + O(ǫ3)

ρǫ = ρ + ǫρ′ +

ǫ2ρ′′ + O(ǫ3),

and also expand the potential energy W :

W (ρǫ) = W (ρ) + ǫW ′(ρ)ρ +

ǫ2(W ′′(ρ)ρ2 + W ′(ρ)ρ′′) + O(ǫ3).

Substituting these expansions into the reduced Lagrangian gives

This expansion is now truncated, leaving out all terms of order ǫ3 and higher. Denote
the truncated Lagrangian by ˆl(uǫ, ρǫ), and deﬁne the averaged Lagrangian lα by
lα(u, ρ) = hˆl(uǫ, ρǫ)i.

(4.4)

We now outline the procedure by which we arrive at a ﬁnal written expression for
the averaged Lagrangian lα. The algebra is straightforward but tedious, so details
will be omitted.

1. Use equations (2.8) and (2.10) to rewrite (4.3) in terms of only u, ρ, and the

ﬂuctuations ξ′, ξ′′.

2. Remove two kinds of terms that vanish inside the average:

(a) linear functions of ξ′ or ξ′′,
(b) linear functions of derivatives (either spatial or temporal) of ξ′ or ξ′′.

Note: see “Zero-Mean Fluctuations” in §3 for justiﬁcation.

3. Carry out the averaging operation. As in the incompressible case, the only

quantities left inside the average should be nonlinear functions of ξ′.

The end result for the averaged Lagrangian for compressible ﬂow is

(4.6)

Remark. One might try to substitute ρ = constant into (4.5) in an attempt to
back out the averaged Lagrangian for incompressible ﬂow. The resulting expres-
sion will not be the correct answer found in equation (3.8). This is because the
density ﬂuctuations that have been introduced into the compressible derivation are
parameterized by ξ′ and ξ′′, as are the velocity ﬂuctuations. Upon expansion and
substitution of (2.10), therefore, the velocity and density ﬂuctuations interact in a
way that is impossible in the incompressible derivation.

5 Flow Rule Modeling

In deriving the expressions (4.5) and (3.8) for the averaged Lagrangians, no as-
sumptions were made regarding how the Lagrangian ﬂuctuations ξ′ evolve. In this
section we describe one possible strategy for modeling ξ′. Note that some such
strategy is necessary to achieve closure for the evolution equations associated with
the Lagrangians (4.5) or (3.8).

3Any function w satisfying ∇w = (∇p)/ρ, where p is pressure, is called enthalpy. Our deﬁnition

of w implies w,i = 2W ′(ρ)ρ,i + ρW ′′(ρ)ρ,i = (ρ2W ′(ρ)),i/ρ = p,i/ρ as required.

Flow Rules. For compressible ﬂows, two ﬂow rules will be considered. We deﬁne
them ﬁrst, and then go on to consider their relative merits and demerits:

I. Advection: Ωij = ui

II. Rotation: Ωij = 1

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Advection. For our anisotropic model, we shall advect ξ′ and treat the quantities
F , G, and H as parameters in the ﬁnal system, each of which will have its own
evolution equation. Substituting Ωij = ui

,j into the system (5.3) gives

∂tF = −£uF
∂tG = −£uG + F · grad(div u)
∂tH = 2 grad(div u) · G − u · grad H.

(5.4a)

(5.4b)

(5.4c)

One advantage of the advection ﬂow rule is that it automatically closes the system
(5.3). For a general choice of Ω, the system involves

cannot be expressed solely in terms of F , G, and H.

Rotation. For our isotropic model, we wish to preserve the isotropy relationship
F = Identity that was mentioned earlier (see (3.17) in the context of incompressible
ﬂow.) Suppose F ij = δij at t = 0. Then substituting into (5.3a) reveals that

∂t|t=0F ij = Ωij + Ωji.

(5.5)

Therefore, if Ω is antisymmetric, we have, ∂t|t=0F = 0. A standard result (see John
[1982]) tells us that for analytic coeﬃcients and initial data, the ﬁrst-order linear
PDE (5.3a) has a unique solution. We conclude that antisymmetry of Ω is suﬃcient
to guarantee that the initial data F = Identity is in fact preserved for all t. Then
an immediate choice of a tensor Ω that is antisymmetric is given by the rotation
ﬂow rule (II). This form has a very attractive physical interpretation. Putting the
linear ﬂow rule equation (3.10) together with (II) gives us

Dξ′
Dt

= ω × ξ′,

(5.6)

where ω = curl u is the vorticity vector. The last equation can be interpreted in
the sense that ﬂuctuations are rigidly transported by the mean ﬂow, with a local
angular velocity given by the vorticity vector.

Finally, the rotation ﬂow rule (II) does not by itself close the system (5.3). When

using this ﬂow rule, we shall assume that G = 0 and H = β2.

6 Equations for Averaged Dynamics

Here we shall write down two systems of coupled PDEs which describe the evolution
of the average velocity and density in a compressible ﬂow. Each PDE is derived from
an associated averaged Lagrangian.

Compressible, fully Anisotropic, Inhomogeneous Fluids. By substituting
(I) into the Lagrangian (4.5), we obtain closure: the Lagrangian no longer depends
explicitly on ξ′, but instead on the tensors F , G, and H, for which a self-contained
system of evolution equations (5.4) has already been derived—see §5 for details.
Applying Hamilton’s principle directly to (5.2) yields an evolution equation for u,
the average ﬂuid velocity. We write this equation using the operator A, which is
deﬁned as

ρvi
(cid:16)
We also write ˜w = ρw′(ρ) where ′ means d/dρ as usual. The anisotropic compressible

Well-posedness. We now sketch a rough well-posedness argument for the sys-
tem (6.2). Assume that the tensor F is positive-deﬁnite. By this it is meant,
since F is a (2, 0) tensor, that for any one-form θ, the contraction F : (θ ⊗ θ) is
positive everywhere. Given the ρ-weighted inner product hf, gi =
f g ρ, we have
f,jF jkf,k ρ > 0. Since −A is a positive deﬁnite
,k ρ =
hf, −Af i = −
linear operator, (1 − α2A) has trivial kernel and we expect that (6.2) is well-posed.
It would be of analytical interest to see to what extent the “geodesic part” of
these equations deﬁne a smooth spray in the sense of Ebin and Marsden [1970], and
which holds for the EPDiﬀ equations (that is, the n-dimensional CH equations), as
explained in Holm and Marsden [2004].

Observations.

• In the case of homogeneous incompressible ﬂow, where ρ is constant and

div u = 0, the deﬁnition of ρv in (6.5) reduces to

v =

u,

(cid:18)

which after rescaling α to get rid of the factor of 1/2 is precisely the v one
ﬁnds in treatments of the incompressible LAE-α and LANS-α equations.

• The above does not work in 1-D. The problem is that here Ω reduces to
(ux − ux)/2 = 0, which clearly does not describe transport at all. For a
1-D isotropic model one may very well want to forget about antisymmetry
of Ω and instead use something such as the advection ﬂow rule. One may,
quite reasonably, conclude that the only meaning of isotropy in 1-D should be
reﬂection symmetry.

7 Future Directions

The Initialization Problem. Perhaps the largest unsolved problem for the La-
grangian averaged equations is the initialization problem. A concise statement of
the problem reads:

Given initial data u0(x) for the Euler equation, how does one obtain
initial data U0(x) for the LAE-α equation?

Let us look at this problem in slightly more detail. Let u denote the solution of the
incompressible Euler equations for initial data u0, i.e. u(x, 0) = u0(x). Similarly,
let U denote the solution of the incompressible, isotropic LAE-α equations (3.21)
for initial data U0.

Now U should be, in some sense, the mean ﬂow of the ﬂuid. This means that U0
should be the mean ﬂow of the ﬂuid at time t = 0, implying that U0 should be, in
some sense, an “averaged” or “ﬁltered” version of u0. The question is: how does one

7 Future Directions

19

derive U0 from u0? Another way of phrasing this question is: how do we describe
(approximately) the initial state of the ﬂuid (given exactly, for our purposes, by the
ﬁeld u0) using only the mean ﬂow variable U0?

Numerous methods have been used to initialize the LAE-α equations for use in
numerical simulations, but none of these methods has any theoretical foundation.
There is also no theory regarding how one should ﬁlter a full Euler ﬂow u, or even a
family of ﬂows uǫ, in order to obtain a mean ﬂow that could be compared with the
full LAE-α trajectory U . In this respect, equation (2.4), which states that

huǫ ◦ ξǫ(x, t)i = u(x, t),

is not helpful: we have no way to compute the ﬂuctuation diﬀeomorphism group ξǫ.
Therefore we have no way to compute the left-hand side huǫ ◦ ξǫi.

The diﬃculty can be summarized in the following commutative diagram. Here

S is the standard Euler action and Sα is the Lagrangian-averaged action.

Solid arrows represent steps that we know how to carry out. The dashed arrow
represents the one step that we do not know how to carry out. Our strategy for
this problem will be to develop methods by which we can test diﬀerent ﬁlters for
obtaining U0 from u0 in practice.

Treatment of Densities. Another area for further investigation involves our
treatment of the density tube µǫ. There are two questions to ground us:

1. We have tacitly assumed that at t = 0, and for all ǫ, all x,

µ(x, t) = µǫ(x, t).

An argument similar to the one made above in our discussion of the initializa-
tion problem can be made here. Namely, µ(x, 0) represents the mean density
at time t = 0. Meanwhile, µǫ(x, 0) represents the true density of the ﬂuid
at time t = 0. These two quantities need not be equal. This prompts the
question: how would we carry out the procedure from Sections 2 and 4 with
tubes in which each trajectory does not have the same initial density µ(x, 0)?

2. As our derivation of the averaged compressible equations stand, we have de-
rived the fact that the “mean” density µ was advected by the mean ﬂow U :
∂tµ = −£U µ. Substituting µ = ρ dNx and using the deﬁnition of divergence
yields the standard continuity equation

∂tρ + div(ρU ) = 0.

In both RANS and LES treatments of averaged/ﬁltered ﬂow, the mean ﬂow U
satisﬁes a modiﬁed continuity equation rather than the standard one. There-
fore: why does the Lagrangian averaged mean density µ satisfy the usual
continuity equation?

The two questions regarding densities are in fact related. To see this, let us suppose
that given the initial density µ0 associated with the center line of our tube η, we
have a method for constructing a family of initial densities µǫ
0 for each of the other
curves in the tube ηǫ. Now deﬁning5

µǫ(t) = (ηǫ

and ¯µ(t) = hµǫ(t)i,

we will ﬁnd that ¯µ(t) = ¯ρ(t) dNx satisﬁes a modiﬁed continuity equation

To close this equation, we must either carry out the average directly, or we must
expand ρǫ about a suitable trajectory and make modeling assumptions.

Simpler Models. We have seen that the current averaging procedure leads to
complicated averaged equations. Furthermore, there is no clear way to evaluate
numerically the ﬂow rules we have proposed on physical grounds. One of our imme-
diate goals is to investigate a ﬁltering approach, still at the level of the Lagrangian,
which will lead to simpler averaged models that can be tested numerically. The
ﬁltering approach we have in mind begins with a decomposition of the velocity ﬁeld

u = ¯u + u′ and ρ = ¯ρ + ρ′

(7.1)

into mean and ﬂuctuating components. This would replace the Taylor expansion
(4.2) of uǫ and ρǫ that we carried out in the present work, and would therefore lead
to Lagrangians and equations with much less algebraic complexity. As opposed to
the axiomatic averaging operation h·i, the ﬁlter shall be speciﬁed concretely. We
expect this to help greatly with the initialization and density problems discussed
above; furthermore, the ﬁltering approach leads naturally to questions about the
relationship between LES and LAE-α models

Connections with Kevrekidis’ Coarse/Fine Methods. Given a description
of any mechanical system, not necessarily involving ﬂuids, in the form of a La-
grangian ℓ, we can carry out the procedure described in §2 to ﬁnd an averaged
Lagrangian hℓi. From this we can derive equations of motion for the average dy-
namics of the original system. Changing our language slightly, we say that we have a
general method for extracting the “coarse” dynamics of a mechanical system whose
full description involves motions on both ﬁne and coarse scales.

Another method for computing the coarse-scale dynamics of a mechanical system
has been put forth by in Kevrekidis et. al. [2002]. Kevrekidis’ method does not

involve trying to write down equations of motion which govern the coarse dynamics.
Instead, he oﬀers an algorithmic approach, the crux of which is as follows. The
coarse dynamics of a system are found by lifting the initial (t = t0) state to an
ensemble of initial states, integrating each using the full equations until some small
ﬁnal time t = ǫ has been reached, and projecting the resulting t = ǫ states onto a
single state. This t = ǫ state is then extrapolated to a state at some desired t = tf >
0. By iterating this process and tuning the lifting, projection, and extrapolation
operations, this method can be used to recover the coarse dynamics of the system.
Now the question that begs to be asked is as follows: for the case of ﬂuid dy-
namics, how diﬀerent are the coarse dynamics provided by the LANS-α equation
from the coarse dynamics one would obtain by following Kevrekidis? The diﬃculty
in answering this question lies in implementing a full ﬁne-scale integrator for ﬂuids
that one could successfully embed inside Kevrekidis’ coarse-scale algorithm. We
look forward to tackling this task soon.

Adding Combustion and Chemistry. Many systems of engineering and sci-
entiﬁc importance include not only ﬂuid dynamics, of course, but also complex
phenomena such as advected chemical reactions,
including combustion, and the
interaction of charged ﬂuids with magnetic ﬁelds. We believe that the general La-
grangian averaging techniques developed in this paper will extend to such problems
written in the Lagrangian frame, but this remains to be explored.

Before proceeding with any derivations, we state the Lie derivative theorem for
time-dependent vector ﬁelds: if the vector ﬁeld Xλ has ﬂow Fλ, then

Our task now is to derive equations (2.10). Starting with (2.6), let us move ηǫ

to the right-hand side of the equation:

The strategy is to diﬀerentiate with respect to ǫ and use the Lie derivative theorem
(9.1). The intrinsic deﬁnition of divergence

and the canonical volume form dNx = dx1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxN will both be used in what
follows. Note that div ζ with no subscript on the div means £ζ(dNx). Before
applying the Lie derivative theorem, note that the vector ﬁeld

has ﬂow ηǫ. A simple computation yields

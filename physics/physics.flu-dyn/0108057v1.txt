Abstract

Nonlinear non-stationary equation describing evolution of weakly curved pre-
mixed ﬂames with arbitrary gas expansion, subject to the Landau-Darrieus
instability, is derived. The new equation respects all the conservation laws
to be satisﬁed across the ﬂame front, as well as correctly takes into account
inﬂuence of vorticity, generated in the ﬂame, on the ﬂame front structure and
ﬂame velocity. Analytical solutions of the derived equation are found.

I. INTRODUCTION

Description of premixed ﬂame propagation is, in essential, the description of develop-
ment of the Landau-Darrieus (LD) instability [1,2] of zero-thickness ﬂames. Given arbitrary
ﬂame front conﬁguration, its evolution is determined by the exponential growth of unstable
modes, eventually stabilized by the nonlinear mode interaction. By themselves, the nonlin-
ear eﬀects are not suﬃcient to stabilize ﬂame propagation, since the spectrum of unstable
perturbations of a zero-thickness ﬂame is unbounded. In many cases, however, an upper
bound for the mode wavenumber is provided by the heat conduction – species diﬀusion
processes in the ﬂame, which govern the evolution of short-wavelength perturbations [3].
The ﬂame propagation is thus described as the nonlinear propagation of interacting modes
of zero-thickness front, with an eﬀective short-wavelength cut-oﬀ described at the hydro-
dynamic scale by means of an appropriate modiﬁcation of the evolution equation and the
conservation laws at the ﬂame front [4].

In this purely hydrodynamic formulation, the ﬂame dynamics is governed essentially by
the only parameter – the gas expansion coeﬃcient θ, deﬁned as the ratio of the fuel density
and the density of burnt matter. Unfortunately, in general it is very diﬃcult to reduce the
complete system of hydrodynamic equations governing ﬂame dynamics to a single equation
for the ﬂame front position. This is mainly because the nonlinearity of ﬂame dynamics
cannot be considered perturbatively. For instance, it can be shown that in the regime of
steady ﬂame propagation, the ﬂame front slope can be considered small only if the gas
expansion is small (θ → 1), while for ﬂames with θ = 6 ÷ 8 it is of the order 2 ÷ 3 (discussion
of this issue can be found in Ref. [8]). At the early stages of development of the LD-
instability, however, the perturbation analysis is fully justiﬁed, and the equation describing
nonlinear propagation of the ﬂame front can be obtained in a closed form. Within accuracy
of the second order in the ﬂame front slope such an equation was obtained by Zhdanov and
Trubnikov (ZT) [5], without taking into account the inﬂuence of the eﬀects related to ﬁnite
ﬂame thickness, mentioned above. The latter were included in the ZT-equation ad hoc by
Joulin [6].

Concerning the ZT-equation and its modiﬁcation, we would like to note the following.
1) Although this equation respects all the conservation laws to be satisﬁed across the
ﬂame front, it was derived on the basis of a certain model assumption concerning the ﬂow
structure downstream. Namely, it was assumed that the velocity ﬁeld can be represented
as a superposition of a potential mode and an “entropy wave”, so that the pressure ﬁeld
is expressed through the former by the usual Bernoulli equation. The generally nonlocal
relation between the pressure and velocity ﬁelds is thus rendered local algebraic, which
allows simple reduction of the system of hydrodynamic equations to the single equation for
the ﬂame front position. Being valid at the linear stage of development of the LD-instability,
this model assumption is, of course, unjustiﬁed in general.

2) It was assumed in the course of derivation of the ZT-equation that not only the front
slope, but also the value of the front position itself is a small quantity. As a result, the ZT-
equation turns out to be non-invariant with respect to space translations in the direction of
ﬂame propagation. Practical consequence of this assumption is the unnecessary limitation of
the range of validity of the equation: the space and time intervals should be taken suﬃciently
small to ensure that the deviation of the front position from the initial unperturbed plane

2

is small everywhere.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the only assumption of smallness of the ﬂame
front slope is actually suﬃcient to derive an equation describing the nonlinear development
of the LD-instability to the leading (second) order of nonlinearity. Surprisingly, this equation
turns out to be of a more simple structure than that of the ZT-equation. This simpliﬁcation
is due to existence of a representation of the ﬂow equations at the second order, which can
be called transverse. In this representation, the system of equations governing the ﬂame
propagation can be brought into the form in which dependence of all dynamical quantities
on the coordinate in the direction of ﬂame propagation is rendered purely parametric.

Let us consider the question of existence of this representation, and more generally,
the meaning of the weak nonlinearity expansion, in more detail. First of all, the following
important aspect of the problem should be emphasized. The curved ﬂame propagation is an
essentially nonlocal process, in that the presence of vorticity produced in the ﬂame implies
that the relations between ﬂow variables downstream generally cannot be put into the form
in which the value of one variable at the front surface can be expressed entirely in terms of
other variables taken at the same surface. For instance, the value of the pressure ﬁeld at the
ﬂame front depends not only on the gas velocity distribution along the front, but also on its
distribution in the bulk. This means in turn that the equation describing the ﬂame front
evolution cannot generally be written in a closed form, i.e., as an equation which expresses
the time derivative of the front position via its spatial gradients, because the gas dynamics
in the bulk depends, in particular, on the boundary conditions for the burnt matter. In the
framework of the weak nonlinearity expansion, this non-locality shows itself as the necessity
to increase the diﬀerential order of the equation for the ﬂame front position. For example,
it was shown in Ref. [8] that in order to take into account inﬂuence of the vorticity drift on
the structure of stationary ﬂames with the accuracy of (θ − 1)4 in the asymptotic expansion
for θ → 1 (which is the relevant weak nonlinearity expansion in the stationary case), one
has to increase the diﬀerential order of the integro-diﬀerential equation by one as compared
to the Sivashinsky equation (the latter is of the second order in θ − 1, corresponding to
the approximation in which the gas ﬂow is potential on both sides of the front). Roughly
speaking, the nonlocal relations, being integral from the non-perturbative point of view, are
treated diﬀerential of inﬁnite order in the framework of the weak nonlinearity expansion.

Let us now turn back to our present purpose of derivation of equation for the front po-
sition at the second order of nonlinearity. Remarkably, it turns out that this approximation
is exceptional in that the above-mentioned nonlocal complications do not arise in this case.
We will give now a simple illustration of this important fact. Let us consider a weakly curved
ﬂame propagating in z-direction with respect to an initially uniform fuel, and denote x the
transverse coordinates. If the ﬂame front position is described by equation z = f (x, t), then
the condition that front is only weakly curved implies that ∂f (x, t)/∂x is small, and so is
the gas velocity perturbation δv. From the continuity equation

and the Euler equations

one has

function of the ﬂow variables, satisfying ∇2Ω = 0, and
where Ω(z, x, t) is a local
G(z, x, z′, x′, t) is the Green function of the Laplace operator, appropriate to the given
boundary condition. Note that the latter, being a condition on the pressure jump across the
ﬂame, is imposed only at the ﬂame front. Since the unperturbed velocity ﬁeld is spatially
uniform, one has from Eq. (2) for the curvature induced pressure variation δP

δP (z, x, t) = −ρ

dz′dx′G(z, x, z′, x′, t)∂iδvk(z′, x′, t)∂kδvi(z′, x′, t) + δΩ(z, x, t) .

Next, let us denote δx the characteristic length of the front perturbation. Then the corre-

As we noted above, “boundary condition” for the pressure ﬁeld is imposed only at the ﬂame
front. Therefore, the Green function ˜G is independent of any other conditions relevant to
the ﬂow of the burnt matter (e.g., boundary conditions on the tube walls, in the case of
ﬂame propagation in a tube). The same is true for the function Ω, since the value of Ω at a
given point depends only on the value of ﬂow variables at the same point. We thus see that
Eq. (4) is an integral relation between local functions of the ﬂow variables, deﬁned on the
front surface, which is independent of the ﬂow dynamics in the bulk. Furthermore, since the
right hand side of Eq. (4) is of the second order, it is not diﬃcult to show, using the linear
decomposition of the ﬂow ﬁeld into potential and vortex components, that z-derivatives of
the velocity can be expressed via its derivatives along the ﬂame front, bringing this equation
into the transverse representation. This implies that at the second order, there exists a
universal equation which describes the ﬂame front dynamics in terms of the front position
alone. In practice, it is actually more convenient to work with the diﬀerential form of the
ﬂow equations, rather than integral. How their transverse representation can be derived will
be shown in detail in Sec. II A. On the basis of this result, the nonlinear non-stationary
equation will be derived in Sec. III. Its analysis is carried out analytically using the method
of pole decomposition in Sec. IV. The obtained results are summarized in Sec. V.

II. FLOW EQUATIONS AND CONSERVATION LAWS

Let us consider a 2D ﬂame propagating in the negative z-direction with the normal
velocity Uf with respect to an initially uniform quiescent combustible gas mixture. Denoting
x the transverse coordinate, we introduce dimensionless space and time variables (η, ξ) ≡
(x/R, z/R), τ ≡ tUf/R, where R is a characteristic gasdynamic length of the problem. Then
the normalized ﬂuid velocity v = (vx/Uf, vz/Uf) ≡ (w, u) and pressure Π = (P − P (ξ =
−∞))/ρ−U 2

f obey the following equations in the bulk

completes the above system of hydrodynamic equations and conservation laws, determining
dynamics of the ﬂame front itself.

Below, we will need the general solution of the ﬂow equations (5)–(7) upstream. Going
over to the rest frame of reference of the initially plane ﬂame front, this solution is readily
obtained as follows. Since the ﬂow is potential at ξ = −∞ (where u = 1, w = 0), it is
potential for every ξ < f (η, τ ) in view of the Thomson theorem [7], thus

where the Hilbert operator ˆH is deﬁned by

”p.v.” denoting the principal value. Equations (12), (13) represent the general form of
the potential velocity ﬁled satisfying the boundary conditions at ξ = −∞, while Eq. (14)
is nothing but the Bernoulli equation. Note that the 2D Landau-Darrieus operator ˆΦ is
simply expressed through the Hilbert operator ˆΦ = −∂ ˆH. Note also that although the
relation w = ˆH ˜u between the velocity components upstream is nonlocal, it is expressed in
terms of the transverse coordinate η only.

A. Bulk dynamics in transverse representation

Our next step is the reduction of the system of ﬂow equations (5) – (7) to one equation
in which the role of the coordinate ξ is purely parametric. For this purpose, it is convenient
to introduce the stream function ψ via

1. First order approximation

To perform the weak nonlinearity expansion, it is convenient to explicitly extract zero-

order values of the ﬂow variables downstream

General solution of Eq. (19) has the form analogous to Eqs. (12), (13)

Diﬀerentiating Eq. (20) with respect to η we obtain

Next, linearizing Eq. (6) and using the above equations for the potential and vorticity modes,
one ﬁnds

With the help of Eqs. (22), (23), and (25) equation (24) can be rewritten as

In this form, the ﬂow equation governing dynamics downstream contains no explicit opera-
tion with the ξ-dependence of the ﬂow variables. In other words, this dependence is rendered
purely parametric. Let us now show that Eq. (26) can be generalized to take into account
interaction of the perturbations.

III. NONLINEAR EQUATION FOR THE FLAME FRONT

Now we can show that the set of equations (8) – (11), (13), (14), and (32) can be reduced
to one equation for the function f (η, τ ). To this end, it remains only to rewrite the right
hand sides of the conservation laws and evolution equation in the form in which transition
on the ﬂame surface (ξ → f (η, τ )) is performed after all diﬀerentiations, again bringing
the latter to the transverse form. This is easily done using the continuity equation (5) and
taking into account potentiality of the ﬂow upstream

After having done this, one sees that the knowledge of explicit ξ-dependence of the
ﬂow variables turns out to be unnecessary. Roughly speaking, the ξ-dependence of a func-
tion F (ξ, η, τ ) describing the ﬂame front shape is known in advance, since the equation
F (ξ, η, τ ) = 0 can always be brought into the form ξ − f (η, τ ) = 0 (with f many-valued,
in general). To determine the ﬂame front evolution, therefore, it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd only
(η, τ )-dependence of the functions involved. To put this intuitive reasoning in the formal
way, it is convenient to introduce separate designations for the up- and downstream velocity
and pressure ﬁelds, distinguishing them by the superscripts ” − ” and ” + ”, respectively.
Then, setting ξ = f (η, τ ), equations (13), (14), (32) together with the conservation laws (8)
– (10) and evolution equation (11) can be rewritten identically as follows

Suppose we found a solution f = f (η, τ ), v− = v−(ξ, η, τ ), v+ = v+(ξ, η, τ ), etc. of
the set of equations in the large brackets in (∗). Then, in particular, these equations are
satisﬁed for ξ = f (η, τ ). On the other hand, since no operation involving ξ appears in these
equations, the function f (η, τ ) is independent of a particular form of ξ-dependence of the
ﬂow variables. For the purpose of deriving an equation for f (η, τ ), it is most convenient
to work with the particular solution in which all the functions are ξ-independent, and to
omit the large brackets in (∗). Therefore, we can replace the above set of equations by the

respectively, and

υ− ≡ 1 + ˜υ−, υ+ ≡ θ + ˜υ+.

(43)

The fact that now the function f (η, τ ) does not enter the arguments of these variables
allows us to avoid expanding them in powers of f, employed in Ref. [5]. In fact, such an
expansion is irrelevant to the issue, since all the equations governing ﬂame propagation are
invariant with respect to the space translations, and therefore, all terms containing powers
of undiﬀerentiated f should appear in invariant combinations in the ﬁnal equation for f. In
view of this invariance, the function f itself does not need to be small even if the front is
only weakly curved. We thus see that the f -dependence of the ﬂow variables through their
arguments must eventually cancel out in some way in any case.

Now, the system of Eqs. (36) – (42) can be transformed into one equation for the function
f (η, τ ). To simplify the derivation, the stabilizing eﬀects due to the ﬁnite ﬂame thickness
will be taken into account only in the linear approximation. As we already mentioned in
the Introduction, these eﬀects are mainly taken into account in order to provide the short
wavelength cutoﬀ for the spectrum of the ﬂame front perturbations. In view of this, the
nonlinear corrections in the ε-terms are of little interest. Using Eq. (36), the “evolution
equation” (42) can be rewritten within the accuracy of the second order

Next, solving Eqs. (39) – (41) with respect to υ+, ω+, π+, and substituting the results
into Eq. (38), one obtains an equation for the upstream variables ˜υ−, ω−, π−, which can
be further reduced to an equation for ˜υ− alone using Eqs. (36), (37). Upon substituting
the expression (44) into the latter equation, one arrives at the nonlinear equation for the
function f (η, τ ), which we do not write explicitly because of its great complexity. It can be
highly simpliﬁed using the ﬁrst order LD-equation

Finally, we would like to comment on the range of validity of the derived equation. Gen-
erally speaking, Eq. (48) is only applicable for description of the early stages of development
of the LD-instability, since it is obtained under the assumption of smallness of the front
slope. Even if the ﬂame evolution is such that it smoothly ends up with the formation of
a stationary conﬁguration (instead of spontaneous turbulization), this assumption becomes
generally invalid whenever the process of ﬂame propagation is close to the stationary regime.
In fact, it can be easily shown that the assumptions of stationarity and weak nonlinearity
contradict each other (detailed discussion of this point can be found in Ref. [8]). Inciden-
tally, the fact that the transition to the stationary regime in Eq. (48) is formally incorrect
is clearly seen from its derivation given above. Namely, the stationary form of this equation
depends on the way the ﬁrst order relation (45) is used in the second order terms before
time derivatives are omitted. Only in the case of small gas expansion (θ → 1) is weak non-
linearity approximation justiﬁed at all stages of development of the LD-instability, in which
case Eq. (48) goes over to the well-known Sivashinsky equation [9]

In this respect, a natural question arises as to what extent equation (48) is actually valid
when θ is arbitrary. Since the structure of higher order terms of the power expansion is
unknown, it is very diﬃcult to give even a rough estimate. Leaving this question aside, we
will simply assume in what follows, that this equation is formally valid for all times. It will
be shown below that at least in the case of ﬂame propagation in narrow tubes, solutions to
the stationary version of Eq. (48) are in reasonable agreement with the results of numerical
experiments [14] for ﬂames with the gas expansion coeﬃcient up to θ ∼ 3.

IV. THE POLE DECOMPOSITION

As in the case of ZT-equation, development of the LD-instability of a plane ﬂame can
be described in terms of the pole dynamics. To show this, we ﬁrst perform the following
nonlinear transformation

Spatially periodic (with period 2b) solutions of equations of the type (51) can be found

using the following pole decomposition [6,10]

where the value of the amplitude a as well as dynamics of the complex poles ηk(τ ), k =
1, ..., 2P are to be determined substituting this anzats into Eq. (51). Since the function
φ(η, τ ) is real for real η, the poles come in conjugate pairs; P is the number of the pole
pairs. Requiring the 2b-periodic solutions to be symmetric with respect to the reﬂection
η → −η, one can obtain periodic as well as non-periodic solutions to Eq. (51) in the domain
η ∈ (0, b), satisfying the conditions ∂φ
∂η (b, τ ) = 0, describing ﬂame propagation in
a tube of width b with ideal walls.

provided that

Since the application of pole decomposition to Eq. (51) is quite similar to that given in
Refs. [6,10], we will present below only ﬁnal results, referring the reader to these works for
more detail.

Following Ref. [10], we ﬁrst consider two poles (η1, η2) in the same half plane of the
complex η, which are fairly close to each other, so that their dynamics is unaﬀected by the
rest. Then one has from Eq. (54)

which indicates that the poles attract each other in the horizontal direction (parallel to the
real axis), and repel in the vertical direction, tending to form alignments parallel to the
imaginary axis. Furthermore, assuming that the pole dynamics ends up with the formation
of such a “coalescent” stationary conﬁguration, and using the fact that γ < β + να (it is
not diﬃcult to verify that actually γ/(β + να) < 1/3), the following upper bound on the
number of pole pairs P can be easily obtained from Eq. (54)

Still, for suﬃciently wide tubes (such that σ < ν/3), the solution (52) is not unique: diﬀerent
solutions corresponding to diﬀerent numbers P of poles are possible. To ﬁnd the physical
ones, it is necessary to perform the stability analysis. Noting that the functional structure of
Eq. (51) is very similar to that of Eq. (49), the stability analysis of Refs. [11]– [13], where it
was carried out for the Sivashinsky equation, will be carried over the present case. According
to this analysis, for a given not-too-wide tube, there is only one (neutrally) stable solution.
This solution corresponds to the number of poles that provides maximal ﬂame velocity, i.e.,

(cid:18)
Int(x) denoting the integer part of x. Thus, the ﬂame velocity increase Ws ≡ |∂φ0/∂τ | of
the stable solution can be written as

Fig. 1 compares the theoretical dependence of the maximal ﬂame velocity increase Wm
on the gas expansion coeﬃcient, given by Eq. (56), with the results of numerical experiments
[14]. For comparison, we show also the corresponding dependence calculated on the basis of
the Sivashinsky equation. Dependence of the eﬀective cut-oﬀ wavelength on the expansion
coeﬃcient is shown in Fig. 2. We see that even beyond of its range of applicability, Eq. (51)
provides reasonable qualitative description of ﬂames with the expansion coeﬃcients of prac-
tical interest. Complete investigation of the LD-instability on the basis of this equation will
be given elsewhere.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The main result of our work is the nonlinear non-stationary equation (46) which describes
development of the Landau-Darrieus instability in the second order of nonlinearity. We have
derived this equation on the basis of the only assumption of smallness of the ﬂame front slope.
Thus, nonlinear evolution of the front perturbations generally obeys Eq. (46) which takes
even simpler form (51) if one is only interested in dynamics of the exponentially growing
LD-solutions. It is important to stress that no assumption concerning the value of the ﬂame
front position has been used in the derivation. Therefore, Eq. (46) can be applied not only
to plane ﬂames, but also to the problem of unstable evolution of any ﬂame conﬁguration,
provided that the front slope is small.

It is also worth of emphasis that Eq. (46) is obtained without any assumptions about the
structure of the gas ﬂow downstream. Thus, this equation is the direct consequence of the
exact hydrodynamic equations for the ﬂow ﬁelds in the bulk, and conservation laws at the
ﬂame front. We would like to stress also once again that the universal form of Eq. (46) is
the distinguishing property of the second order approximation. In the general case, equation
for the ﬂame front should contain also information about the ﬂow of the burnt matter in
the bulk. Indeed, as was shown in Ref. [8], the boundary conditions for the burnt matter
are invoked in the course of derivation of the equation already at the third order. This
universality of Eq. (46) allows it to be widely applied to the study of ﬂames with arbitrary
front conﬁguration, propagating in tubes with complex geometries.

Abstract

We investigate oblique impacts of a circular disk and
water surface. An experiment [ Clanet, C., Hersen,
F. and Bocquet, L., Nature 427, 29 (2004) ] revealed
that there exists a “magic angle” of 20◦ between a
disk face and water surface which minimize the re-
quired speed for ricochet. We perform 3-dimensional
simulation of the water impacts using the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and analyze the
results with an ordinal diﬀerential equation (ODE)
model. Our simulation is in good agreement with
the experiment. The analysis with the ODE model
give us a theoretical insight for the “magic angle” of
stone skipping.

Problem of impacts and ricochets of solid bodies
against water surface have been received a consider-

early stage, the problem was of importance in naval
engineering [8]. The investigations then mainly con-
cerned with the impacts of canon balls oﬀ sea surface.
Some experiments revealed, for ricochet of spheres,
that there exists a critical angle θcr, above which the
rebound does not occur. Furthermore the critical an-
gle has a simple relation to speciﬁc gravity of the
sphere σ as θcr = 18/√σ [9]. This empirical law was
theoretically explained using a simple ODE model
[9, 10]. In the military engineering today, problem of
water impacts is not as important as that of a century
ago. However, the problem attracts renewed interest
under studies of locomotion of basilisk lizards [11]
and ricochet of stone [12].

This study is motivated by an experimental study
by C. Clanet et. al. They experimentally investi-
gated the impact of a circular disk ( stone ) with
water and found that an angle about φ = 20◦ be-
tween the disk face and water surface would be the
“magic angle” which minimizes the required velocity
for ricochet [1]. In this Paper, we report our theoret-

ical and numerical results for the oblique impact of
disks and water surface. And we present a theoretical
insight why the angle φ = 20◦ plays an speciﬁc role
for ricochet.

To perform a numerical simulation of the disk
entry, we solve the Navier-Stokes equation using
the technique of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) [13, 14]. In Fig 1, we show the snapshots of our
simulation. This technique is based on Lagrangian
description of ﬂuid and has an advantage to treat
free surface ﬂows. For this method, several represen-
tation of the viscous term in Navier-Stokes equation
have been proposed. In this work, we adopt an artiﬁ-
cial viscous term [15] which is simple for computation
and suﬃciently examined with Couette ﬂow [16].

In the following discussion, we analyze an ODE
model which was originally introduced by Birkoﬀ et

enough, so that the angle φ remains constant during
the process owing to a gyroscopic eﬀect [12]. Both
the experiments ([1]) and our numerical simulations
support the validity of this simpliﬁcation.

Taking a frame of reference O-ξζ as shown in Fig.

al[17]. The model is based on the following assump-
tions; (i) Hydrodynamic pressure p acting on surface
n)2, where v is the
from water is proportional to (v
speed of the body and n is the unit vector to the sur-
face. (ii) For the part of surface facing air, there is
no hydrodynamic force. (iii) During the whole pro-
cess, deformation of water surface is negligible, and
the boundary between immersed and non-immersed
area is simply given as the cross section to a hori-
zontal plane at water level. The ﬁrst assumption is
reasonable because Reynolds number would be of or-
105 for typical cases of stone ricochet [18].

Let us apply the ODE model to the water entry
problem with circular disk as a ”stone” (Fig. 2).
Since the net force f to the stone from water is pro-
portional to the area S of water-stone interface, we
have

where ρ is the density of water, n normal vector. We
need to mention that the drag coeﬃcient CD is not
necessarily constant during the impact. For example,
it varies according to the depth of immersion for ver-
tical entries of spheres or disks [6, 5]. Hence, for the
oblique water entry of disks, CD would also depend
on conditions such as initial angles θ, φ. However, un-
fortunately, there is no experimental data available to
determine CD to our purpose. In this study, we use
CD
1.4, which is obtained from our SPH simula-
tions of the typical initial angles (θ = 20◦, φ = 20◦)
and assume CD is constant throughout the impact
process.

For simplicity, we limit ourselves to the case that

Here ξ, ζ and z are the position of the lower edge
of disk in each coordinates, σ is the speciﬁc gravity,
λ = R/d and F = v2

0/gR is Froude number.

These equations give us a straight forward insight
for an necessary condition for stone-skip. Because
the acceleration along with ξ direction is constant all
the time, starting from the initial conditions with

one can ﬁnd the stone always depart downward from
the water surface, therefore, skipping of stone would
not take place. The numerical calculations agree with
the condition with the equality as long as g = 0 (F

→
). However, this argument does not account the

seal of air cavity behind the disk. Our SPH simula-
tion gives θ + φ . 0.87π/2 for skipping-stone domain
in the condition of no gravitation.

Let us estimate the lowest velocity for a bounce
vmin as a function of the angles θ and φ. A straight
forward criterion whether a stone skips or not would
be the vertical position after the entry into water sur-
face; if the stone could recover the position higher
than the water level, one could say it skips ( criterion
A ). However, to make the analysis simple, we adopt
an alternative criterion ( criterion B ); If the velocity
˙z of the disk changes its sign to positive we regard
ricochet takes place. Under this deﬁnition, the entry
velocity such that the trajectory of the disk have an
inﬂection point on its horizontal line would give the
minimum velocity vmin for ricochet.

We can derive an equation which describes tra-
jectories of disk motion. Eq.
(2) could be eas-
ily integrated with initial conditions ξ(0) = 0 and
˙ξ(0) = cos(θ + φ). Using the expression of ξ(t), one
could replace the time derivative in Eq. (3) with that

In order for the criterion B to be satisﬁed, it is nec-
essary that the inﬂection point exists in the domain
of (ξ∗ > 0) and (z∗ < 0). It turns out that in Eq. (6)
ξ∗ has the maximum value ˆξ∗ when the disk is fully
immersed, i.e., for S(z∗) = π. Solving Eq. (6) for
Fmin(vmin), we ﬁnally obtain an expression for vmin

Since the inﬂection point ˆξ∗ still remains unknown,
it should be determined so as to ﬁt experiments.
However we cannot make a direct comparison be-
tween the Eq. (7) and the experimental data ([1])
because vmin and θmax are acquired under the crite-
rion A in experiments. We thus ﬁt the Eq. (7) with
the result of our SPH simulations performed under
criterion B and had ˆξ∗ = 2.6. Due to the nature of
the criterion B, these analytical expressions for vmin
and θmax should give a lower and upper limit of the
skipping domain respectively.

We then discuss our results.

In all the analyses,
we chose the same parameters as that of experiment
([1]) unless particularly mentioned; λ = 9.1, σ = 2.7

200. For the SPH simulation, λ = 2.5 and angu-
lar velocity of the disk ω = 65[rounds/s]. Figure 3
shows the domains of skipping stone in (φ, v) and
(θ, φ) planes. The theoretical results under Both of
criterion give the vmin which qualitatively agrees with
the experiment. SPH simulations and our theory un-
der criterion B reproduce the vmin reaches which has
its minimum at φ

20◦.

For the maximum angle θmax, experiment indicates
that the skipping-stone domain shrinks at θ < 20◦.
The theoretical curve under criterion B does not re-
produce this tendency while that of criterion A shows
the similar behavior. This is due to the assumption
that the inﬂection point takes place when the disk is
fully immersed. Especially in the case that the θ is
much smaller relative to the tilt angle φ, this assump-

tion would be totally incorrect. The SPH simulation
also shows diﬀerent behavior with the experiment un-
der θ < 20◦. We cannot present a clear explanation
for this discrepancy, however, we mention that, at
very small incident angle, the depth of immersion of
the disk would be of the order of the ﬂuid particle size
of SPH. The numerical error hence becomes larger for
small θ and for the domain θ < 10◦ simulation is not
attainable.

Experiment indicates that the angle φ

20◦ would
be a characteristic in both (φ, v) and (θ, φ) planes. C.
Clanet et. al. hence suggested that the angle φ = 20◦
is the ”magic angle” for stone-skippnig. However Eq.
(7) implies that φ depends on θ.
In Figure 4, We
show how the “magic angle” φ∗ is aﬀected by the
incident angle θ. Our theory suggests φ∗ decreases
with incident angle and our simulation also shows
a decreasing tendency. However, the change in φ∗
is suﬃciently small: φ∗ only changes about 15% of
incident angle under θ = 40◦. We therefore conclude
that the ”magic angle” still remains around φ = 20◦
for the ordinal incident angle at stone skipping.

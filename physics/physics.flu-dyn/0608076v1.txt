We introduce corrections to the Navier-Stokes equation arising from the transitions between molec-
ular states and the injection of external energy. In the simplest application of the proposed post
Navier-Stokes equation, we ﬁnd a multi-valued velocity ﬁeld and the immediate possibility of velocity
reversal, both features of turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

First, collisional invariants χ are deﬁned such that

Traditionally, any attempt to describe turbulent be-
havior in ﬂuids starts with the Navier-Stokes equation
(NSE) [1]. However, success has at best been mixed [2].
In this Letter, we explore the idea that NSE is not the
unique approach to the study of turbulence, and that tur-
bulence may be found in what we label as post-Navier-
Stokes equations. What could modify NSE? In our opin-
ion, the molecular nature of ﬂuids can no longer be ig-
nored [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. So we attempt to modify NSE
by including quantum concepts, and in particular, in its
simplest application, arrive at the possibility of velocity
reversal and multi-valued velocity ﬁelds [9], both impor-
tant features of turbulence. Before showing these ﬁnal
results, we need to make two comments on the deriva-
tion of NSE to justify our proposed post-NSE.

The traditional way of deriving the Navier-Stokes
equation (NSE) is phenomenological, based on the con-
tinuum model and conservation of momentum. It may
also be derived using the kinetic theory of structure-
less molecules by starting with the Boltzmann transport
equation

arrive at post-NSE equations, we quickly comment on
the assumptions of the derivation.

These collisional invariants are χ = m (mass), χ = mvi
(i = 1, 2, 3 momentum), χ = 1
2 m|v − u(r, t)|2 (thermal
energy), where u(r, t) = hvi.

To get the NSE, multiply the Boltzmann transport
equation by p and integrate over all momentum, yielding

where ρ(r, t) = mn(r, t) and Pij = ρh(vi − ui)(vj − uj)i.
Our ﬁrst comment is that the above equation results
from microscopic conservation laws assuming elas-
tic collisions of point molecules.

To arrive at the traditional NSE, we need an explicit

form of the pressure tensor, which is taken to be

where µ is the viscosity. The above choice of the pressure
is justiﬁed by the assumption that a ﬂuid element, or
microscopically, as our second comment, the particle
of the model has no intrinsic angular momentum.

Notice that before the introduction of the deﬁnition of
the pressure, the conservation of momentum equation is
exact in so far as the Boltzmann transport equation is
valid. This equation comes only from the left-hand side
of the Boltzmann equation. The contribution from the
collision term disappears by virtue of conservation of mo-
mentum and the assumption of elastic collisions. Hence,
only the left hand side of the Boltzmann transport equa-
tion is important to yield the conservation of momentum
equation and NSE. We stress the two assumptions needed
to arrive at the Navier-Stokes equation: ﬁrst, elastic col-
lisions, and second, the absence of angular momentum of
the structureless molecules. What will happen if these
two assumptions are no longer valid?

CORRECTING THE NAVIER-STOKES
EQUATION

Suppose that each of the molecules could be found in
any one of N states, the ground state and (N − 1) ex-
cited states. Assume that excitations and de-excitations
are induced by molecular collisions, which are now inelas-
tic. Then the semi-classical analogue of the Boltzmann
transport equation for each of N distribution functions
will be

γmn is the transition probability of a particle in the
m state jumping to the n state. J is a “jump” operator
that will carry the conservation law the we will invoke
in the time evolution of N distribution probabilities. K
is a “kick” operator that allows the injection of energy
from outside [11, 12, 13, 14]. σ is the probability that
a particle is kicked to a diﬀerent momentum by external
means. The kick operator makes the injection of energy
into the system possible. Eq. (6) is a generalization of
our previous models [11, 12, 13, 14].

To calculate macroscopic averages, not only must we
integrate over all momentum, we should also sum over
all N states, to yield

We may think of (9) and (10) as the quantum correc-
tions to the NSE. The ﬁrst sum (9) is the driving term.
We will call the second sum (10) the radiative correc-
tion because every transition is accompanied by radia-
tion. (NSE ignores not only molecules, but also photons.)
The radiative term represents the contribution of the in-
ternal degrees of freedom of molecules to the macroscopic
ﬂow of a ﬂuid. If all the transition probabilities are zero,
we simply reproduce the classical NSE. This last equa-
tion, our post-NSE, no longer assumes elastic collisions
and the absence of angular momentum of the particles.
The operators J and K have been deﬁned in our earlier
model calculations [11, 12, 13, 14], they may be redeﬁned
with new models, but we will simplify them to show that
even the simplest application of Equation (8) leads to
novel results.

We have had occasions to consider the radiative term
[11, 12, 13, 14], and will consider them later even more,
but for now to arrive at immediate new results, we con-
sider only the inﬂuence of quantized kicks deﬁned by the
operator Kfn(r, p) = fn(r, p − Π) yielding

ditions. The physical model is one-dimensional, a donut

half-stuck into the donut to provide quantum kicks to the

Depending on the problem parameters σ, m, Π, and
f (x), it is possible that the characteristic curves cross. If
the characteristics cross at (xc, t), then there are multiple
curves s1, s2, . . . such that xc = x(t; s1) = x(t; s2) = · · ·.
Moreover, the solution permits multiple values u(xc, t) =
u(x(t; s1), t), u(x(t; s2), t), . . . at the crossing point. Fig-
ure 2 demonstrates this feature in a simple example.

CONCLUSIONS

It appears that in our ﬁrst applications of a highly
simpliﬁed post-Navier-Stokes equation, we have arrived
at multi-valued velocities as a function of location. They
may well be interpreted as possible states of a turbulent
system from which transitions to other states may be
possible. The possibility of velocity reversal, a feature of
turbulence, is immediately obvious. This result seems to
be the ﬁrst instance of an analytic derivation of a multi-
valued velocity ﬁeld and deserves further studies.

The boundary conditions can be parameterized as

For each ﬁxed value of s, solving the characteristic equa-
tions (17) with initial values x(0; s) = x0(s), t(0; s) =
t0(s), u(0; s) = u0(s) yields a characteristic curve
u(x(τ ; s), t(τ ; s)) in the solution surface u(x, t). For more

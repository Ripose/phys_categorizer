Analytical solution for nonlinear Schr¨odinger
vortex reconnection

Sergey Nazarenko and Robert West

Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK

Analysis of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger vortex reconnection is given in terms
of coordinate-time power series. The lowest order terms in these series cor-
respond to a solution of the linear Schr¨odinger equation and provide sev-
eral interesting properties of the reconnection process, in particular the non-
singular character of reconnections, the anti-parallel conﬁguration of vortex
ﬁlaments and a square-root law of approach just before/after reconnections.
The complete inﬁnite power series represents a fully nonlinear analytic so-
lution in a ﬁnite volume which includes the reconnection point, and is valid
for ﬁnite time provided the initial condition is an analytic function. These
series solutions are free from the periodicity artifacts and discretization error
of the direct computational approaches and they are easy to analyze using a
computer algebra program.

INTRODUCTION

Vortex solutions of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation are of
interest in nonlinear optics 1,2,3 and in the theory of Bose-Einstein conden-
sates 4 (BEC). The NLS equation is also often used to describe turbulence
in superﬂuid helium. 5 NLS is a nice model in this case because the vortex
quantization appears naturally in this model and because its large-scale limit
is the compressible Euler equation describing classical inviscid ﬂuids. 6,7 At
short scales, the NLS equation allows for a “quantum uncertainty principle”
which allows vortex reconnections without the need for a ﬁnite viscosity
or other dissipation. Numerically, NLS vortex reconnection was studied by
Koplik and Levine8 and, more recently, by Leadbeater et al.9 and, for a
non-local version of NLS equation, by Berloﬀ et al.4 In applications to su-
perﬂuid turbulence, the NLS equation was directly computed by Nore et

S.V. Nazarenko and R.J. West

al.10 Such cryogenic turbulence consists of repeatedly reconnecting vortex
tangles, with each reconnection event resulting in the generation of Kelvin
waves on the vortex cores 11 and a sound emission. 9 These two small-scale
processes are very hard to correctly compute in direct simulations of 3D NLS
turbulence due to numerical resolution problems. A popular way to avoid
this problem is to compute vortex tangles by a Biot-Savart method (derived
from the Euler equation) and use a simple rule to reconnect vortex ﬁlaments
that are closer than some critical (“quantum”) distance. This approach was
pioneered by Schwarz 6 and it has been further developed by Samuels et
al.12 In this case, it is important to prescribe realistic vortex reconnection
rules. Therefore, elementary vortex reconnection events have to be carefully
studied and parameterized. Numerically, such a study was performed by
Leadbeater et al., 9 the present paper is devoted to the analytical study of
these NLS vortex reconnection events.

→

The analytical approach of this paper is based on expanding a solution
in powers of small distance from the reconnection point, and small time mea-
sured from the reconnection moment. The idea is to exploit the fact that
when vortex ﬁlaments are near reconnection, the nonlinearity in the NLS
equation is small. This smallness of the nonlinearity just stems from the
deﬁnition of vortices in NLS (curves where Ψ = 0) and the continuity of Ψ.
Their core size is of the order of the distance over which Ψ
1 (where Ψ = 1
represents the background condensate). Therefore, for vortices near recon-
nection, separated by a distance much smaller than their core size, Ψ is small
provided it is continuous. Thus, to the ﬁrst approximation the solution near
the reconnection point can be described by a linear solution which, already
at this level, contains some very important information about the recon-
nection process: (1) that the reconnection proceeds smoothly without any
singularity formation, (2) that in the immediate vicinity of the reconnection
the vortices are strictly anti-parallel and (3) just before the reconnection
1/2, where t is the
event the distance between the vortices decreases as

time measured from the reconnection moment. Note that result (1) could
surprise those who draw their intuition from vortex collapsing events in the
Euler equation (which are believed to be singular). On the other hand, re-
sults (2) and (3) are remarkably similar to the numerical and theoretical
results found for the Euler equation. 13,14,15

In section II of this paper we examine the local analysis of the recon-
nection process by deriving a linear solution and in section III consider its
properties. The linear solution describes many, but not all the important
properties of vortex reconnection.
In particular, it cannot describe solu-
tions outside the vortex cores and, therefore, it cannot describe the far-ﬁeld
sound radiation produced by the reconnection. On the other hand, one can

Analytical solution for nonlinear Schr¨odinger vortex reconnection

substitute the linear solution back into the NLS equation and ﬁnd the ﬁrst
nonlinear correction to this solution. Recursively repeating this procedure,
one can recover the fully nonlinear solution in terms of inﬁnite coordinate
and time series. This derivation is discussed in detail in section IV. The se-
ries produced are a general solution to a Cauchy initial value problem. Thus,
by Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem, 16 these series deﬁne an analytic function
(with a ﬁnite convergence radius) provided the initial conditions are analytic.
The generation of such a suitable initial condition is addressed in section V.
Our series representation of the solution to the NLS equation is exact, and
therefore will include such properties as sound emission. However, due to
the ﬁnite radius of convergence of the analytic solution, one is unable to ob-
serve a far-ﬁeld sound emission directly. In this paper, we use Mathematica
to compute some examples of the fully nonlinear solutions for the vortex
reconnection. The results of which are presented in section VI.

Let us summarise the advantages and disadvantages that our analytical
solution has with respect to those being computed via direct numerical sim-
ulations (DNS). Firstly, our analytical solutions are obtained as a general
formula, simultaneously applicable for a broad class of initial vortex posi-
tions and orientations. Secondly, our analytical solutions are not aﬀected by
any periodicity artifacts (which are typical in DNS using spectral methods)
or by discretization errors. On the other hand, our analytical solutions are
only available for a ﬁnite distance from the vortex lines (of the order of the
vortex core size) because their deﬁning power series have a ﬁnite radius of
convergence.

2. LOCAL ANALYSIS OF THE RECONNECTION

Let us start with the defocusing NLS equation written in the non-

dimensional form,

Suppose that in vicinity of the point r = (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) at t = t0 we have

Ψ = Ψ0 such that ReΨ0 = z, and ImΨ0 = az + bx2
c are some positive constants. For such initial conditions the geometrical
location of the vortex ﬁlaments, Ψ = 0, is given by two intersecting straight
lines, z = 0 and y =

In the small vicinity of the point r = 0, deep inside the vortex core
(where Ψ0 ≈
0), we can ignore the nonlinear term found in equation (1).
Further, by a simple transformation Ψ = Φeit we can eliminate the third
term Ψ and obtain iΦt + ∆Φ = 0. (This just corresponds to multiplying
our solution by a phase, it does not alter its properties, but does make the

For both t
t0 > 0 the set of vortex lines, Φ = 0, is given
by two hyperbolas. A bifurcation happens at t = t0 where these hyperbolas
degenerate into the two intersecting lines (see Fig. 1). This bifurcation
corresponds to the reconnection of the vortex ﬁlaments. Thus, we have
constructed a local (in space and time) NLS solution corresponding to vortex
reconnection. Obviously, this solution corresponds to a smooth function Φ at
the reconnection point. It should be stressed that this is not an assumption,
but just the way in which we have chosen to construct our solution. However,
we do believe that this observed smoothness is a common feature of NLS
vortex reconnection events. If this is true then all such reconnecting vortices
could locally be described by the presented solution as the intersection of a
hyperbola with a moving plane provides a generic local bifurcation describing
a reconnection in the case of smooth ﬁelds.

3. The nonlinearity plays a minor role in the late stages of vortex recon-
nection in NLS. This is a simple manifestation of the fact that in the close
spatio-temporal vicinity of the reconnection point Ψ
0, so that the dy-
namics are almost linear.
This last property can be also reformulated as follows. No singularity is ob-
served in the process of reconnection according to the solution (2): both the
real and imaginary parts of Ψ behave continuously in space and time. This
property is in drastic contrast to the singularity formation found in vortex
collapsing events described by the Euler equation. Indeed, distinct from in-
compressible ﬂuids, no viscous dissipation is needed for the NLS vortices to
reconnect. Here, dispersion does the same job of breaking the topological
constraints (related to Kelvin’s circulation theorem) as viscosity does in a
normal ﬂuid.

INITIAL CONDITION

Our next step is to construct a suitable initial condition for our study
of reconnecting vortices. This initial condition will have to be formulated
in terms of a power series. We start by formulating the famous line vortex
solution to the steady state NLS equation 5 in terms of a power series.

We can manipulate this prototype solution to get an initial condition

up of two vortices, Ψ1 and Ψ2, a distance 2d and angle 2α apart. Following
the example of others, [Koplik et al., Ref. 8] and [Leadbeater et al., Ref. 9],
we take the initial condition to be the product of Ψ1 and Ψ2, that is Ψ0 =
Ψ1Ψ2. One could argue that such an initial condition is rather special, as two
vortices found in close proximity would typically have already distorted one
another in their initial approach. Nevertheless, such a conﬁguration provides
us with a valuable insight into the dynamics of NLS vortex reconnections.

6. RESULTS

It would time consuming to expand the analytical solution, derived in
the previous section, by hand. Thankfully, we can use a computer to perform
the necessary algebra, and to derive the hugh number of terms the recursive
formulae generate. What follows is an example solution of the reconnection
of two initially separated vortices.

Firstly, we need to consider the validity and accuracy of our initial con-
dition. Fig. 2, shows the prototype solution A = A(r) for a single vortex,
at various diﬀerent orders. Increasing the order will obviously improve ac-
curacy. However, one should note that at higher order there is evidence
of a ﬁnite radius of convergence rc. This will restrict the spatial region of
validity for our full t-dependent solution. Our prototype solution also has
a dependence on a1. In the following simulation we have chosen a1 = 0.6
numerically so that the properties of A(r) match that of a NLS vortex. It is
evident that we cannot satisfy these properties completely (namely Ψ

) as our power series diverges near rc. Nevertheless, this does not
present us with a problem if we restrict ourselves to considering the evolution

alized in our solution by drawing contours of

is somewhat harder than the analysis of the vortices themselves. Of course
the validity of the full t-dependent solution will be restricted, in the spatial
sense, by the initial condition’s region of convergence. The region of con-
vergence will evolve, remaining ﬁnite during a ﬁnite interval of time (by the
Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem), but then may shrink to zero afterwards.

We will now discuss an example solution. As we only wish to demon-
strate this method, we will not consider a high order solution in this paper.
In our example simulation below, we used Mathematica to perform the nec-
essary algebra in generating a nonlinear solution up to O(ǫ6). (One should
note that although the prototype solution (5) for a single vortex has a2n = 0
for all n, our initial condition is made up of two vortices, i.e. two series
multiplied together. Therefore, there will be cross terms of order O(ǫ6) in
our initial condition).

Our choice of parameters will be d = 0.6 and α = π/4. This corresponds
to two vortices, initially separated by a distance 1.2, at right angles to each
other. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the iso-surface

in detail we can clearly see evidence of some of the properties mentioned
earlier - that of a smooth reconnection (the absence of singularity) and the
anti-parallel alignment of vortices prior to reconnection.

7. CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented a local analysis of the NLS reconnection
processes. We showed that many interesting properties of the reconnection
can already be seen at the linear level of the solution. We derived a recursion
formula Eq. (3) that gives the fully nonlinear solution of the initial value
problem in a ﬁnite volume around the reconnection point for a ﬁnite period
of time. In fact, formula (3) can describe a much wider class of problems.
Of interest, for example, are solutions describing the creation or annihilation
of NLS vortex rings. This process is easily described by considering vortex
rings, at there creation/annihilation moment, as the the intersection of a
plane with the minimum of a paraboloid. Further, this method of expansion
around a reconnection point can be used for other evolution equations, e.g.
the Ginzburg-Landau equation. These applications will be considered in
future. We wish to thank Robert Indik, Nicholas Ercolani and Yuri Lvov for
their many fruitful discussions.

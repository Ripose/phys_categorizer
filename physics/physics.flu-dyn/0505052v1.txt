We study theoretically the capturing of paramagnetic beads by a magnetic ﬁeld gradient in a
microﬂuidic channel treating the beads as a continuum. Bead motion is aﬀected by both ﬂuidic and
magnetic forces. The transfer of momentum from beads to the ﬂuid creates an eﬀective bead-bead
interaction that greatly aids capturing. We demonstrate that for a given inlet ﬂow speed a critical
density of beads exists above which complete capturing takes place.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using
magnetic beads in separation of, say, biochemical species
in microﬂuidic systems [1, 2]. The principle is to have
biochemically functionalized polymer beads with inclu-
sions of superparamagnetic nanometersize particles of,
for example, magnetite or maghemite. They attach to
particular biochemical species and can be separated out
from solution by applying external magnetic ﬁelds. As
most biological material is either diamagnetic or weakly
paramagnetic, this separation is speciﬁc. Paramagnetic
particles in ﬂuids are also used to measure the suscepti-
bility of, for example, magnetically labelled cells by mea-
suring particle capture or motion in a known ﬁeld [3, 4].
In this paper we study microﬂuidic capturing of para-
magnetic beads from suspension by modeling the beads
as a continuous distribution [5]. The separation of sus-
pended paramagnetic beads from their host ﬂuid is an
important process as it decides operating characteristics
for practical microﬂuidic devices. It involves an interplay
between forces of several kinds governing the dynamics of
the process: (a) Magnetic forces from the application of
strong magnetic ﬁelds and ﬁeld gradients. (b) Drag forces
due to the motion of the beads with respect to the host
ﬂuid. (c) The trivial eﬀect of gravity, which we ignore in
the following. We emphasize the eﬀects of bead motion
on the ﬂuid ﬂow as this gives rise to a hydrodynamic
interaction between the beads. As we have noted in a
previous few-bead study, this interaction is more impor-
tant than the magnetic bead-bead interactions [6]. It is
created by drag forces in two steps: First, drag transfers
momentum to the ﬂuid from the beads moving under the
inﬂuence of external forces. Second, the modiﬁed ﬂow
changes the drag on and thus motion of other beads.

II. MODEL

As sketched in Fig. 1(a) we consider a viscous ﬂuid
(water) ﬂowing in the x direction between a pair of par-
allel, inﬁnite, planar walls. The walls are placed parallel
to the xy plane at z = 0 and z = h, respectively. A
steep magnetic ﬁeld gradient is generated by a parallel

pair of closely spaced, inﬁnitely long, thin wires along the
y direction separated by d and carrying opposite currents
±I. The system is translation invariant in the y direction
thereby reducing the simulation to a tractable problem in
2D. The simulation domain is deﬁned by 0 < x < L and
0 < z < h with L = 350 µm and h = 50 µm. The wires
intersect the xz plane near (x, z) = (250 µm, 55 µm) just
above the top plate. Paramagnetic beads in suspension
are injected into the microﬂuidic channel by the ﬂuid ﬂow
at x = 0. They are either exiting the channel at x = L
or getting collected at the channel wall near the wires.

When a suspension of beads is viewed on a suﬃciently
large scale compared to the single bead radius a but on
a scale comparable to density variations, we can describe
the distribution of beads in terms of a continuous, spa-
tially varying bead number density c. We consider a sus-
pension of beads with radius a = 1 µm and denote the
initial number density at x = 0 by co. The four basic
constituents of the model are described in the following.

Magnetic force. The beads are paramagnetic with a
magnetic susceptibility χ = 1. In an external magnetic
ﬁeld Hext(r) the force on such a bead is

Fext = µo

assuming that the bead is so small that we can take the
external ﬁeld Hext to be approximately constant across
the bead, i.e., a|∇Hext| ≪ |Hext| when determining the
magnetization M.

As mentioned, Hext in this study arises from a pair
of current carrying wires.
It is determined in the fol-
lowing manner. From Amp`ere’s law, we readily ﬁnd
the magnetic ﬁeld, H, around a straight circular wire,
H(r) = J × r/(2πr2), where the electrical current vec-
tor J is along the wire orthogonal to the position vector
r which is in the xz plane. The magnetic ﬁeld from the
two closely spaced anti-parallel wires is found by decreas-
ing the separation d and increasing the current, I = |J|,
while keeping the product Id constant,

Hext =

Fluid ﬂow. The beads are suspended in a ﬂuid of vis-
cosity η and density ̺ that is launched at x = 0 with a
parabolic velocity proﬁle, uo, and ﬂows past the wires. In
microﬂuidics inertial eﬀects are unimportant compared
to drag, so the small beads in suspension almost always
move with constant velocity relative to the ﬂuid. Ex-
cept for acceleration phases shorter than microseconds
the external forces are exactly balanced by drag [7]. The
momentum transfer from beads to ﬂuid is included by
adding a bulk force term, cFext(r) to the Navier–Stokes
equation. This bulk force term is proportional to the
number density c of beads and the magnetic external
force Fext on an individual bead at position r. The ve-
locity u of the ﬂuid is given by

̺∂tu + ̺(u · ∇)u = −∇p + η∇2u + cFext,

(4)

along with the incompressibility condition ∇ · u = 0.

Bead motion. To complete the set of equations, it is
necessary to have an equation of motion for the bead
number density c. As the beads neither appear nor dis-
appear in the bulk, c must obey a continuity equation

∂tc + ∇ · j = 0,

with diﬀusivity D and bead mobility b = 1/(6πηa).

For our spherical beads the diﬀusivity is given by the
Einstein expression D = kT /(6πηa) which for water at
room temperature equals 2.2 × 10−13 m2/s. In the simu-
lations below, however, we artiﬁcially increase the mag-
nitude of D in order to stabilize the computations and to
use a coarser mesh and thus save computation time.

Boundary conditions.

In addition to the bulk equa-
tions (4), (5), and (6), we need appropriate boundary
conditions. As the beads move out to the walls of the
domain and settle there, merely demanding that the nor-
mal component of the bead current vector j vanishes is
not correct, rather, it must be free to take on any value
as long as it is directed into the wall. As beads do not en-
ter the bulk from the walls (by assumption once settled,
beads stick) we demand that the normal current compo-
nent is never directed into the liquid. For the ﬂuid we
demand the usual no-slip condition at the walls.

At the inlet x = 0 of the microﬂuidic channel we as-
sume that the ﬂuid comes in with the constant initial
number density co and with a parabolic ﬂuid velocity
proﬁle uo. At the outlet x = L we let the bead current
take on any value, while the ﬂuid pressure is zero.

between capturing and ﬂushing: the twenty curves from Fig. 2

product Id and the maximum in-ﬂow speed uo are shown. At
low densities less than 50% are caught; at high densities the
collective motion of the beads leads to 100% capture.

III. RESULTS

Having set up the equations for bead and ﬂuid motion,
they are solved with the ﬁnite element method on a mesh
with ∼ 104 elements reﬁned in the vicinity of the wires.
To this end we employ the ﬁnite element solver software
package Femlab [9]. The parameter values for the ﬂuid
are those of water, η = 1 mPas and ̺ = 103 kg/m3, while
for the beads a = 1 µm and co = 1013 to 1016 m−3.

To study capturing we must keep track of which beads
are captured and which are ﬂushed through the channel
with the ﬂow. This is done by calculating the rates γi
by which the beads are either captured or transported
in/out at each of the four boundary segments i of the
channel (inlet, outlet, upper wall, and lower wall). By
integration of the normal components of the bead cur-
rents along each segment i, we ﬁnd

γi =

j·n dℓi.

(7)

The rate of capture is γcap = γlower + γupper. In steady
state the conservation of beads enforces γinlet + γcap +
γoutlet = 0, which provides a useful check of the simu-
lation results. The primary control parameters are the
current-wire distance product Id, the maximum ﬂuid in-
ﬂow speed uo, and the bead number density, co. The
product Id decides the magnetic force which captures the
beads against the ﬂuid ﬂow. As we are investigating ef-
fects of bead-bead interaction, our interest is properties
that depend on the bead number density, in particular
those that do so nonlinearly.

Electrical current and ﬂuid ﬂow. The eﬀects of having
electrical wires near, and thus a magnetic ﬁeld gradient
in, the channel is illustrated in Fig. 1(b)–(d) for three
values of the current-distance product Id. At small val-
ues of Id only a narrow region is emptied but increasing

the current the region expands until it covers the width
of the channel.

A simple measure of the capturing is the ratio β of the

bead capture rate γcap to the bead in-ﬂow rate γinlet,

β =

“capture rate”
“in-ﬂow rate”

=

γcap
γinlet

.

(8)

If capturing dominates β tends to unity, if ﬂushing dom-
inates β tends to zero. Fig. 2 shows this in that slow
ﬂow and strong current leads to a high β whereas fast
ﬂow and weak current leads to a small value. The rate
γcap of bead capture as function of wire current and ﬂow
velocity is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2.

If there is a competition between magnetic capturing
and ﬂushing, then we expect that the data can be de-
scribed essentially by the ratio of the magnetic forces to
the inlet ﬂuid ﬂow speed uo. The force is proportional to
the square of the current-distance product Id. In Fig. 3,
we plot the data from Fig. 2 as function of (Id)2/uo and
see that the data mostly collapses onto a single curve.
The collapse is not perfect and is not expected to be as
the underlying ﬂow and bead distribution patterns (see
Fig. 1) are diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬂows and magnetic ﬁelds.
Interactions and concentration. The second point we
wish to make is that modiﬁcation of the overall ﬂow, and
the eﬀective bead-bead interaction this entails, is signiﬁ-
cant for bead capturing. We can study the eﬀect by ex-
cluding momentum transfer to the ﬂuid ﬂow due to the
bulk force term cFext in the Navier–Stokes equation (4).
At high bead number densities the force acting on the
beads contributes a signiﬁcant force on the ﬂuid aﬀect-
ing ﬂuid ﬂow and spawning the eﬀective interaction. The
strength of this interaction must thus depend on the den-
sity of particles. This is illustrated in Fig. 4; capturing
was simulated at ﬁxed in-ﬂow speed, uo = 300 µm/s,
and a ﬁxed value of the current-wire distance product,

ble diﬀerence between including and excluding the bulk force
term, corresponding to hydrodynamic bead-bead interactions.

Id = 8 µAm, but for varying bead number densities co
ranging from 1013 to 1016 m−3. At low densities we ﬁnd
that capturing is roughly independent of density and the
fraction β of beads captured has some intermediate value,
however, for high densities all beads are caught. In con-
trast, leaving out the bulk force term cFext in the Navier–
Stokes equation, i.e., the force acting on the ﬂuid, gives
concentration independence as shown in Fig. 4.

As can be seen in Fig. 5, a complementary way of ex-
hibiting the importance of the bulk force term is to plot
the diﬀerence ∆β = βincl − βexcl between including and
excluding cFext as a function of concentration and the
current-distance product. This shows that interactions
makes an appreciable diﬀerence at high concentrations
and intermediate magnetic ﬁelds.

Diﬀusion constant. Even for the small beads of radius
a = 1 µm, the diﬀusion constant given by the Einstein
relation is small compared to the dimensions entering the
problem. The time-scale for a bead to diﬀuse across the
channel is τdiﬀ ∼ h2/D. If we are to see the inﬂuence of
diﬀusion competing with bead advection, then the rele-
vant quantity is the P´eclet number hu/D which is advec-
tion time-scale τadv ∼ h/u over the diﬀusion time-scale.

4

When this number is larger than unity, which it is except
for artiﬁcially large diﬀusion constants, then convection
dominates. In the simulations the diﬀusion constant is
increased artiﬁcially up to 10−11 m2/s in order to help
numerical convergence. But we have veriﬁed that values
smaller than 10−10 m2/s have no inﬂuence on the results.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have studied microﬂuidic capture of paramagnetic
beads in suspension. The three main ﬁndings of work are:
the approximate scaling shown in Fig. 3, the existence of
a critical bead density for capture shown in Fig. 4, and
the qualitative diﬀerence for capturing between models
with and without the hydrodynamic bead-bead interac-
tion shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

Clearly, it is very important for the capture process to
include the action of the beads on the host ﬂuid medium.
Simply leaving it out can give qualitatively wrong results
for high concentrations of beads. This casts some doubt
on the measurement of cell susceptibility through captur-
ing as it depends on cell concentration [3, 4]. Deduction
of susceptibilities from single bead or cell considerations
together with measurements at high bead or cell concen-
tration is suspect. Care must be taken to compare with
standards of known and similar susceptibility, size, and
concentration.

The eﬀective bead-bead interaction greatly helps cap-
turing. It should make detectable diﬀerences depending
on whether there are a few or hundreds of particles in a
channel at a time in actual experiments especially when
the ﬂow and magnetic ﬁeld are such that the beads are
barely caught one by one. This interaction should be
considered when choosing operating conditions for mi-
croﬂuidic devices based on capturing of beads as higher
bead number densities potentially eases requirements for
external magnets and allows faster ﬂushing. We hope
that experimental studies will be initiated to verify this
prediction of our work.

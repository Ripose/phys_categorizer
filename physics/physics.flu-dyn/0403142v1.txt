Turbulent-laminar patterns near transition are simulated in plane Couette ﬂow using an exten-
sion of the minimal ﬂow unit methodology. Computational domains are of minimal size in two
directions but large in the third. The long direction can be tilted at any prescribed angle to the
streamwise direction. Three types of patterned states are found and studied: periodic, localized,
and intermittent. These correspond closely to observations in large aspect ratio experiments.

Plane Couette ﬂow – the ﬂow between two inﬁnite par-
allel plates moving in opposite directions – undergoes a
subcritical (discontinuous) transition from laminar ﬂow
to turbulence as the Reynolds number is increased. Due
to its simplicity, this ﬂow has long served as one of the
canonical examples for understanding shear turbulence
and the subcritical transition process typical of channel
and pipe ﬂows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Only
recently was it discovered in very large aspect ratio ex-
periments by Prigent et al. [13, 14, 15] that this ﬂow
also exhibits remarkable pattern formation near transi-
tion. Figure 1 shows such a pattern, not from experi-
ment, but from numerical computations reported here.
An essentially steady, spatially periodic pattern of dis-
tinct regions of turbulent and laminar ﬂow emerges spon-
taneously from uniform turbulence as the Reynolds num-
ber is decreased. It now appears that turbulent-laminar
patterns are inevitable intermediate states on the route
from turbulent to laminar ﬂow in large aspect ratio plane
Couette ﬂow.

Related patterns have a long history in ﬂuid dynamics.
In Taylor-Couette ﬂow between counter-rotating cylin-
ders, Coles [16] ﬁrst discovered a state known as spi-
ral turbulence with coexisting turbulent and laminar re-
gions. This state was famously commented on by Feyn-
man [17] and has attracted attention as an example of a
coherent structure comprising both turbulence and long-
range order [18, 19, 20, 21]. Until recently all experimen-
tal studies of this state showed only one turbulent and
one laminar patch. Prigent et al. [13, 14, 15] found that
in a very large-aspect-ratio Taylor-Couette system, the
turbulent and laminar regions form a periodic pattern,
of which the original observations of Coles comprised
only one wavelength. Cros and Le Gal [22] discovered
large-scale turbulent spirals as well, in experiments on
the shear ﬂow between a stationary and a rotating disk.
The Reynolds-number thresholds, wavelengths, and an-
gles are very similar for all of these turbulent patterned
ﬂows. Moreover, Prigent et al. suggest that the turbu-
lent spots [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 22, 23] long known to exist
near transition are essentially a manifestation of the same
mechanism.

FIG. 1: Turbulent-laminar pattern at Reynolds number 350.
The computational domain (outlined in white, aligned along
x′, z′) is repeated periodically to tile an extended region. The
kinetic energy is visualized in a plane midway between and
parallel to the plates moving in the streamwise (x) direction.
Uniform gray or blue corresponds to laminar ﬂow. The sides
of the image are 60 times the plate separation Ly = 2; the
pattern wavelength is 20 Ly. Streamwise streaks (on the scale
of Ly) are visible at the edges of the turbulent regions.

We report the ﬁrst direct numerical simulation of
turbulent-laminar patterns. Our simulations are de-
signed to reduce computational expense, to establish
minimal physical conditions necessary to produce these
large-scale patterns, and to impose and thereby investi-
gate the pattern wavelength and orientation.

Our study extends minimal-ﬂow-unit (MFU) simula-
tions of turbulent channel ﬂows [1, 5, 9] and we begin by
recalling these. The plates located at y = ±1 move at
unit velocities ±ˆx. The Reynolds number is Re = 1/ν,
where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid. The sim-
ple Couette solution uC ≡ yˆx is linearly stable for all
values of Re. However, above a critical Re near 325 [6],
transition to turbulence occurs for suﬃciently large per-
turbations. The turbulence is characterized by the cycli-
cal generation and breakdown of streaks by streamwise-
oriented vortices with a natural spanwise pair spacing
of about 4 [1, 5, 9, 23, 24]. In the MFU approach, a

as a function of amplitude and Re.

We begin with simulations exploring the dependence
of patterns on Re. To allow the system suﬃcient free-
dom to select diﬀerent states, we set Lz′ = 120, two to
three times the experimentally observed wavelength. We
ﬁx θ = 24◦, near its observed value at pattern onset.
Figures 3(a) and (b) show two long series of simulations
spanning the range 290 ≤ Re ≤ 500. Space-time di-
agrams are shown for decreasing and increasing Re in

ﬂuctuations are on the right and principle peaks in asso-
ciated spatial Fourier transforms are on the left.

More speciﬁcally, we compute E = |u − uC|2/2 at 32
points equally spaced in z′ along a line (x′ = y = 0) in
the mid-channel. We compute Erms, the rms of E in time
windows of size T = 250. This gives a measure of the
ﬂow’s turbulent intensity on a space-time grid. (Other
measures such as the rms of individual velocity compo-
nents gives similar results.) Time windows in Fig. 3(a)
show E from which Erms is computed at two points on
the space-time grid. For the spectra on the left, we com-
pute the instantaneous spatial Fourier transform ˆEm of
E for the same 32 points in the mid-channel. We take
the modulus (to remove phase information) and average
over windows of length T = 500 to obtain h| ˆEm|i.

In Fig. 3(a) a turbulent ﬂow is initialized at Re = 500
by perturbing simple Couette ﬂow. We call the resulting
unpatterned state uniform turbulence.
Its spectrum is
ﬂat. Re is decreased quickly to 350 where a pattern forms
with three distinct turbulent and laminar regions. The
m = 3 spectral peak emerges. The selected wavelength of
40 agrees closely with experiment [13, 14, 15]. Re is kept
at 350 long enough to show that this pattern is stable.
The ﬁnal ﬂow at Re = 350 is visualized in Fig. 1. The
pattern remains qualitatively the same through Re =
320. Erms is systematically greater to the left of the band
center. (Note that, due to the imposed tilt, there is no
reﬂection symmetry in z′.) At Re = 310 the pattern loses
one turbulent region, accompanied by the emergence of
the m = 2 spectral peak. At Re = 300, a single turbulent
region remains, and ﬁnally, at Re = 290, the ﬂow reverts
to simple Couette ﬂow.

Figure 3(b) shows states obtained by increasing Re
starting from Re = 350. The steady three-banded pat-
tern persists up through Re = 390. At Re = 400 and
410 the pattern is no longer steady: bands are less well
deﬁned and laminar regions appear and disappear (see
below). Uniform turbulence is obtained at Re = 420.

We now present evidence that the patterns in Fig. 3
represent three qualitatively diﬀerent states. The banded
state at Re = 350 is fundamentally spatially periodic. To
support this we show in Fig. 4 a simulation at Re = 350 in
a domain whose length Lz′ is slowly increased. The pat-
tern adjusts to keep the wavelength in the approximate
range 35 − 65 by splitting the turbulent bands when they

wise vortex pairs with a spanwise spacing of 4. (The vortices

periodic domain of minimal lateral dimensions is sought
which can sustain this basic cycle. For plane Couette
ﬂow near transition, the currently accepted [9] size is ap-
proximately Lx × Lz = 10 × 4 [Fig. 2(a)].

We extend the MFU computations in two ways. First
we tilt the domain at angle θ to the streamwise direction
[Fig. 2(b)]. We designate by x′ and z′ the periodic direc-
tions of the tilted domain. To respect the spanwise streak
spacing while imposing periodic boundary conditions in
x′, the domain satisﬁes Lx′ sin θ ≃ 4, for θ > 0. (For
θ = 0, we only require Lx′ >
∼ 10.) Secondly, we greatly
extend one of the dimensions past the MFU requirement
[Fig. 2(c)]. In practice we use Lz′ between 30 and 220,
usually 120. We can thus simulate large length scales
oblique to the streamwise direction.

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are sim-
ulated using a spectral-element (x′-y) – Fourier (z′)
code [25]. The boundary conditions are no-slip at the
moving plates and periodic in the x′ and z′ directions.
The spatial resolution for the Lx′ ×Ly ×Lz′ = 10×2×120
domain is Nx × Ny × Nz = 61 × 31 × 1024, consistent with
that previously used at these values of Re [5, 8, 9]. Re-
sults have also been verﬁed at higher resolutions.

We make two comments distinguishing our approach.
Experimentalists [13, 14, 15] varied Re and reported the
properties of the resulting patterns:
in particular they
measured angles and wavelengths varying from θ = 25◦
and λz′ = 46 at Re = 394 to θ = 37◦ and λz′ = 60 at
Re = 340. (They extrapolated the domain of existence
to be 325 ≤ Re ≤ 415.) In contrast, we ﬁx the pattern
angle and wavelength: in this way, we can determine the
boundaries in parameter space within which each pattern
can exist. Second, all the turbulent states we report are
bistable with simple Couette ﬂow. A major goal [6, 7,
10, 11], not addressed here, has been the determination

grow too large. The instantaneous integrated energy pro-
ﬁle ¯E ≡ R dx′ dy E(x′, y, z′, t) is plotted at the ﬁnal time.
Between the turbulent bands, E does not reach zero and
the ﬂow, while basically laminar, diﬀers from the simple
Couette solution yex.

In sharp contrast, the single turbulent patch seen in
Fig. 3(a) prior to return to laminar Couette ﬂow is a
localized state. Figure 4 shows that in a domain of in-
creasing size at Re = 300 a single turbulent region of
approximately ﬁxed extent persists, independent of Lz′.
Moreover, ¯E decays to zero exponentially as the ﬂow
approaches the simple Couette solution away from the
patch. The localized states in our computations neces-

illustrating three distinct states: periodic, localized, intermit-
tent. Space-time representation of Erms is as in Fig. 3. For
Re = 350 and Re = 300 the domain length is increased from
Lz′ = 50 to Lz′ = 140 in increments of 5. The integrated
energy proﬁle ¯E(z′) is shown at the ﬁnal time. For Re = 410
a single long simulation is shown for Lz′ = 40, accompanied
by m = 1 (solid) and m = 0 (dashed) spectral peaks.

sarily take the form of bands when visualized in the x − z
plane [e.g., Fig. 5(d) below]. Isolated bands and spots are
reported experimentally [13, 14, 15] near these values of
Re.

The third behavior is displayed by the intermittent
state in Fig. 3 near the transition to uniform turbulence.
Figure 4 shows a long simulation at Re = 410 in a do-
main Lz′ = 40. The ﬂow never stabilizes but instead
quasi-laminar regions nucleate and disappear continually.
The range of Erms in the space-time plot is noticeably
smaller than for the stable patterns. Simulations with
Lz′ = 60 show similar behavior. These states have been
interpreted in [13, 14, 15] as resulting from noise-driven
competition between banded patterns at equal and op-
posite angles. However, the intermittency is captured in
our simulations, even though the competition between
states of opposite angles is absent.

We have increased and decreased Re gradually at
Lz′ = 40 and Lz′ = 60 and ﬁnd no hysteresis in any
of the transitions between the turbulent states.

We have explored regions of existence for various states
as a function of Re, wavelength, and tilt. By varying Lz′

states may shed light on the mechanisms responsible for
laminar-turbulent patterns and for turbulent transition.

FIG. 5: Turbulent-laminar patterns at minimum (θ = 15◦)
and maximum (θ = 66◦) angle for which they have been com-
puted at Re = 350. Conventions as in Fig. 1.

at θ = 24◦, Re = 350, we have determined that the
minimum wavelength is 35 and the maximum is 65. For
∼ 30, uniform turbulence is obtained. For Lz′ >
Lz′ <
∼ 70
two bands of wavelength Lz′/2 form (as in Fig. 4). This
range of allowed wavelengths is nearly independent of Re
wherever we have been able to compute banded states.
Figure 5 shows a banded state at θ = 15◦ and a lo-
calized state at θ = 66◦, the minimum and maximum
angles for which we have thus far obtained patterns for
Lz′ = 120, Re = 350. These extreme states may not
be stable without the imposed periodicity of the compu-
tations. The sequence of states seen for increasing θ at
Re = 350 is qualitatively the same as that for decreasing
Re at θ = 24◦. At θ = 0◦ and θ = 90◦ we do not ﬁnd
patterns, but only either uniform turbulence or simple
Couette ﬂow, with transition boundaries Re ≈ 300 for
θ = 0◦ and Re ≈ 390 for θ = 90◦. Full details will be
reported elsewhere.

In past years minimal-ﬂow-unit simulations have been
used to great eﬀect in understanding shear turbulence.
We have shown that the same philosophy can be em-
ployed in the study of large-scale structures formed in
turbulent ﬂows. Speciﬁcally, we have reported the ﬁrst
simulations of turbulent-laminar patterns in plane Cou-
ette ﬂow by numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions in domains with a single long direction. The other
dimensions are just large enough to resolve the inter-plate
distance and to contain an integer number of longitudinal
vortex pairs or streaks. Thus we have demonstrated that
the patterns are quasi one-dimensional and we have iden-
tiﬁed what we believe to be near-minimal conditions nec-
essary for their formation. Key is that the computational
domain be tilted obliquely to the streamwise direction of
the ﬂow, otherwise no patterns are observed. We have
found periodic, localized, and intermittent states where
similar states are observed experimentally. We have ex-
plored the patterns’ dependence on Reynolds number and
on imposed wavelength and tilt. The existence of lo-
calized states in our simulations is particularly interest-
ing because this suggests that the basic physics of iso-
lated turbulent spots can be captured without simulat-

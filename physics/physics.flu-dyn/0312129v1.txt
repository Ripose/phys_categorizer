We study the destabilization of a shear layer, produced by diﬀerential rotation of a rotating
axisymmetric container. For small forcing, this produces a shear layer, which has been studied by
Stewartson and is almost invariant along the rotation axis direction. When the forcing increases,
instabilities develop. The way these instabilities grow depends strongly on the geometry of the
container. If the depth is constant, the instability develops without breaking the Proudman-Taylor
constraint. However, when the depth is not constant (in a spherical shell for instance), the instability
has to break the Proudman-Taylor constraint, and thus, the threshold is higher. We develop a quasi-
geostrophic two-dimensional model, whose main original feature is to handle the mass conservation
correctly, resulting in a divergent two-dimensional ﬂow, and valid for any ﬁnite slope. We use it to
investigate scalings and asymptotic laws by a simple linear theory and we ﬁnd an asymmetry between
positive and negative diﬀerential rotation; we also propose a correction to take the ageostrophy of
the shear layer into account. Implemented in a numerical code, it allows us to span a broad range of
parameter to study the threshold. We also present some experimental results, validating our model
and showing its limits.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The spherical Taylor-Couette problem, where two spheres are rotating at diﬀerent speeds, will be the base of our
forthcoming sodium experiment, which is under construction, and which goal is to understand the magnetostrophic
equilibrium [5]. This type of ﬂow has been widely studied [see e.g. 1, 16, 26]. However, the range of parameter that
interests us, that is a strong global corotation with a small diﬀerential rotation, has never been studied as far as we
know.

The linear problem resulting in cylindrical shear layers aligned with the axis of rotation has been studied by [23] in
the inviscid case. He pointed out the nested shear layer structure and their scaling. This problem is closely related to
the simpler case of a split cylinder solved earlier by [22] too. In that case, the structure of the shear layer is simpler,
but there is still a nested structure. The general structure of these detached shear layers is studied by [15], by focusing
on the singularities of the boundary-layer equations. Later, a numerical study has been done by [7], recovering the
features and scalings predicted by Stewartson.

The linear stability of this kind of layers has been theoretically investigated by [3] who applied the regular stability
theory to the pressure equation in both cases of constant and varying depth, recovering some kind of Rayleigh criterion.
However, the existing experimental studies are not in quantitative agreement with these results.

The setup of [11], with a horizontal disk rotating diﬀerentially in a ﬂat cylindrical tank, gives rather strange results
and unexpected power-laws. They also observed a strong asymmetry between positive and negative diﬀerential
rotation. Later, [17] peform a similar experiment but with the diﬀerential rotation concentrated on the bottom of
their ﬂat tank. They ﬁnd a critical local Reynolds number for the destabilization of the ﬂow. Their linear theory
which includes Ekman friction and internal viscosity is in good quantitative agreement with their results. They point
out that the internal viscosity is very important to reproduce acurately the experimental results. More recently, [9]
reproduced almost exactly the case studied by [22]. They found that the instability is a supercritical Hopf bifurcation
and that the behaviour of the ﬂow does not depend strongly on the sign of the diﬀerential rotation. The threshold
of instability is governed by a critical local Reynolds number, but the theory of Niino & Misawa predicts a value
[14] investigated the shear-ﬂow instabilities with a parabolic tank and a free

surface. They studied both cases with constant depth or varying depth and pointed out that the varying depth has
a stabilizing eﬀect, as predicted by the linear theory. However, their setup could not investigate the rotation rate
dependance.

Furthermore, the destabilization of a shear layer in a rotating system is of general geophysical interest. Shear layer
dominated by the Coriolis force, are found in natural systems, as in the atmosphere or in the ocean, as well as on other
planets like the jets of Jupiter, which might be unstable and responsible for the observed big eddies. The variation of
the Coriolis force with latitude, known as beta-eﬀect, can be modelled in laboratory experiments by using a varying
depth rotating container [see e.g. 19].

The further organization of this paper is as follows. In §II, we derive the equations of our model, that will be used
to address the problem in the next sections, through numeric calculation and theoretical analysis of the equations.
§III presents results concerning the Stewartson layer, §IV focuses on the stability threshold of this shear layer in the
asymptotic regime and how it compares with various experiments. §V gives corrections for the threshold at ﬁnite
Ekman numbers that explain both numerical and experimental results, while §VI adresses the spatial structure of this
instability near the threshold. Finally §VII contains a summary and discussion.

II. QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC MODEL

The two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (QG) model we present here has been developped to study the ﬂow in
rapidly rotating container, invariant by rotation around the rotation axis. We use the cylindrical coordinate system
(er, eφ, ez), with r the distance to the axis, φ the angle in the plane perpendicular to that axis, and z the height.
The container is deﬁned by two functions z = L+(r) and z = L−(r), for the top and the bottom surfaces respectively.
Here, we ﬁrst restrict to the simpler case where L(r) = L+(r) = −L−(r).

In a frame rotating at angular velocity Ω0 around the vertical axis z, the ﬂow is described by the Navier-Stokes

equation for an incompressible ﬂuid with constant density, including the Coriolis force :

+ (u.∇) u + 2Ω0 ∧ u = −∇Π + ν∇2u

where u is the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld, ν the kinematic viscosity, and Π the pressure ﬁeld, including centrifugal and gravity
−1 and as typical length scale R the radial size of the container.
forces. We introduce a velocity scale U , a time scale Ω0
We then rewrite equation 1 with non-dimensional quantities :

+ Ro (u.∇) u + 2ez ∧ u = −∇Π + E∇2u

with Ro ≡ U/RΩ0 the Rossby number, E ≡ ν/R2Ω0 the Ekman number, and ez the unit vector along the rotation
axis.
In our study, we take for typical velocity the one based on the diﬀerential rotation U = R∆Ω which is supposed to
dominate. Hence, the Rossby number reduces to ∆Ω/Ω0.

A. Proudman-Taylor theorem and z-averaging

For vanishing Ekman and Rossby number, we recover the Proudman-Taylor theorem for a stationary ﬂow : taking

the curl of equation 2, we ﬁnd that

This suggests that for small Rossby and Ekman numbers, the z-variations should be weak and we expect the ﬂow to
be mainly two-dimensional for long-period motions (≫ Ω−1

We now average the z-component of the curl of equation 2 with the additional constraint that ur and uφ are

Note that these Ekman layers will not be resolved in our model, but rather parametrized using their asymptotical

expression. This can be done because their thickness is supposed to be small (δ(ν/Ω)1/2 ≪ R).

where Ωb is the vorticity associated with the velocity of the boundary Ub. In the general case, 8 leads to an expression
of the form

where P is a function depending of the geometry of the container, linear with respect to the jump of ur and uφ at the
boundary and to their ﬁrst order derivatives. See Appendix A for the explicit expression for a spherical container.

We have now two distinct cases. The ﬁrst one is the ﬂat container, where β = 0. We need to use the Ekman
pumping to fully determine the ﬂow. In the other case, with a ﬁnite slope, the Ekman pumping ﬂow is asymptotically
negligible compared to the slope-induced ﬂow, for small enough Ekman numbers. However, even if small, the Ekman
pumping is a dissipative process, whereas the β-term is not. Thus, above the threshold, the Ekman suction may play
an important damping role.

In both cases, we reduced the problem to the determination of two components of the velocity, ur and uφ, depending

only on r and φ.

We introduce a scalar ﬁeld ψ, deﬁned by

uφ is now constrained by the three-dimensional mass conservation equation 5, so that for non-axisymmetric ﬂows,

(cid:18)
With these equations, we can see that the additional β-terms are negligible for βλ ≪ 1, where λ is a typical length
scale of the velocity ﬁeld variations. It reduces then to the widely used small slope approximation [see e.g. 2, 4, 13].
It will be shown later, that at the stability threshold, the typical length scale is of order E1/4, so that asymptotically
this approximation may be valid at the threshold. However, increasing the forcing, large scale structures will eventually
appear, with up to order-one scales, so that we cannot neglect this eﬀect anymore.

(cid:19)

Similar approaches have been developped recently.

[13] proposed a formulation for ocean modelling but with a
regular stream function implying that the mass is not conserved. [25] include the eﬀect of weak topography and Ekman
suction. The advantage of their formulation is that the Ekman suction is also considered as a source of horizontal
divergence. However the simple expression they used for the Ekman boundary condition implicitely assumes small β,
that is nearly ﬂat topography.

G. Axi-symmetric ﬂow

For the axi-symmetric ﬂow, the scalar function formalism does not apply. It is simpler to work with the velocity
ﬁeld rather than with the vorticity. We project the Navier-Stokes equation 2 on eφ, noting that (ez ∧ u) .eφ = ur
and remembering ∂uφ
∂z = 0. Averaging over φ to keep only the axi-symmetric component, we obtain

and using equation 10, we can show that ur is only due to the Ekman pumping and is directly related to uφ so that
the axi-symmetric part is actually one-dimensional : u = uφ(r) eφ + O(E1/2). However, non-linear interactions of
non-axi-symmetric modes can produce axisymmetric ﬂow, so that we keep the terms involving ur. Furthermore, the

At the outer boundary, we always have the non-penetration condition ur = 0, so that Ψ(r = 1) = 0.

III. STEWARTSON LAYERS

A. Previous studies

The linear study of shear layers due to diﬀerential rotation of the walls has been done in the case of two concentric

co-rotating disks [22], and in the case of two concentric diﬀerentially rotating spheres [23].

At ﬁrst order, the ﬂow is invariant along the direction of the rotation axis, and consists of a shear layer which is
smoothing out the discontinuity. There are actually two nested layers (see ﬁg. 1) with depth scaling like E1/3 for the
inner layer, and E1/4 for the outer one. Note that the 1/3 layer is not two-dimensional and smooth out the singularity
in the Ekman pumping due to the outer layer. For the spherical shell case, the inner layer depth scaling is slightly
modiﬁed (E2/7), but the outer one remains the same. Thus, we can expect that the destabilization of the shear
layer in both cases will be closely related. To study the destabilization of such a layer, we use our two-dimensional
formalism, and eventually correct it for the presence of the E1/3-layer.

B. QG-model predictions

In the linear and stationnary regime, when the Rossby number is small, equation 14 reduces to a balance between

C. Numerical results

1. Split-sphere

The split-sphere geometry consist of a sphere, split at a given radius r0 (see ﬁg. 2). We solve equation 20 in the
frame rotating with the outer part at angular velocity Ω0, while the inner part rotates diﬀerentially at ∆Ω (positive
or negative). This linear problem is solved by a simple matrix inversion using a ﬁnite diﬀerence radial scheme with
variable grid spacing. In this case, the boundary velocity Ub is a simple function, Ub = r if r < r0 and Ub = 0 if
r > r0.

The resulting shear layer for r0 = 0.35 is shown on ﬁgure 3. Properly scaled, all these proﬁles can be superposed in
the asymptotic small Ekman number regime. The size of the shear layer scales like E1/4, as predicted by the scaling
analysis. The asymptotic regime seems to be attained for E < 10−6.

2. Spherical shell

The spherical shell (see ﬁg. 2) geometry is the one studied originally by [20], and corresponds to a spherical-Couette
ﬂow. It is also of geophysical relevance because the core of the Earth is composed of a solid iron ball (r0 = 0.35)
surrounded by liquid iron. We have now a boundary velocity Ub = r for the inner sphere, and Ub = 0 for the outer
one. We reduce this problem to the upper half, assuming the equator is a symmetry plane. Note that the equation
is now slightly diﬀerent because we no longer have L+ = −L− = L.

The problem of the Stewartson layer in a spherical shell (including the E1/3-layer), has been adressed numerically
by [7], with a full three dimensional code. We compare these results with the ones obtained with our model on
ﬁgure 4. For E = 10−4, discrepancies are quite important. However for E = 10−6 and even better E = 10−8,
agreement between both results is good. This was expected because the QG-model is designed for these small Ekman
number regimes. From these results we can also expect the E1/3-layer to play only a minor role at such small Ekman
numbers. Note that we can compute very easily such proﬁles, for virtually any Ekman number, going very close the
the asymptotic limit predicted by [20].

IV. ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY THRESHOLD

The assumption that Ro/∆ ≪ 1 implies that the local vorticity Ro Ω can also be neglected in the Coriolis term,
giving a physical meaning to this approximation. We now introduce the frequency f of the disturbance, and its
typical azimuthal wave length m. We will examine the two cases, with and without slope, but let us ﬁrst examine the
inertial terms, which don’t depend on the vortex stretching term :

At the stability threshold, we expect these terms to be in balance :

to derive equation 20, is valid for the stable shear layer and up to the stability threshold.

B. Numerical results

1. Flat container

We reproduce numerically the constant depth experiment done by [9]. The results of our linear calculation for the
threshold is signiﬁcantly lower than the experimental one, but in good agreement with the theory of [17]. The critical
wave length are in good agreement, even above the stability threshold, as shown in table I. This suggest that the
E1/4 shear layer is correctly resolved.

To explain this discrepancy, [9] invoke the lack of the inner layer in the modelling of [17], which is also missing here.

However, we can correct for it, as shown in section V B.

We also reproduce the experiment of [17], which has the particularity of having diﬀerential rotation only at the
bottom, the top rotating at the mean angular velocity. This implies that the base ﬂow has actually two shear layer,
one beeing the Stewartson shear layer, the other beeing a parietal shear layer, attached to the outer boundary. Results
are reported in table II and agree with the original experimental data, as well as whith their numerical calculations.

2. Split-sphere geometry

Finaly, we did the computation in the case of a split sphere. The problem is that the slope parameter β becomes
very large near the equator. In fact, we can show that the Ekman pumping ﬂow becomes dominant in an equatorial
layer of width scaling like E2/5. In this modiﬁed Ekman layer, the two-dimensional approximation certainly breaks
down and our model in no longer valid.

The results for the stability threshold are given in table III and plotted in ﬁgure 5. They match the asymptotical
scaling obtained previously, especially for small Ekman numbers. However signiﬁcant deviations are observed including
a diﬀerence between positive and negative Rossby numbers. This will be investigated in §V.

We expect the perturbation to be a Rossby wave. However, for negative Ro, ωc is negative, which is not compatible
with a Rossby wave. Looking more carefully, the instability develops in the outer region (r > r0) for Ro > 0 and in
the inner region (r < r0) for Ro < 0, which is strongly advected by the base ﬂow (see ﬁgure 3). We can correct for
this advection eﬀect, and the resulting data are shown on ﬁgure 5. This implies that the perturbation is a travelling
Rossby wave in both cases.

Figure 6 shows the ﬂow at the threshold for E = 10−6. The radial features will be adressed in §VI.

3. Boundary conditions and viscosity

With the numerical code, we can test the behaviour of the stability threshold for diﬀerent modiﬁcations in the
model. Results are summarized in table IV. One can notice that the boundary condition (free-slip or no-slip) hardly
aﬀects the threshold, whereas the presence of Ekman friction has a visible eﬀect, which seems to be less important
at low Ekman number. Suppressing the viscosity lowers signiﬁcantly the threshold, but it remains of the same order.

FIG. 5: Plot of the data from table III as a function of the Ekman number. The top-left plot represents the threshold; the top-
right one shows the critical wave number; the bottom-left graph is the raw pulsation at the threshold, whereas the bottom-right
one is corrected for advection eﬀects.

Another eﬀect of removing the viscosity is that the critical mode mc is signiﬁcantly higher, by a factor 1.3 to 1.4.
The divergence correction we introduced seem to be really negligible at the threshold. In general, we can say that all
models seem to converge when lowering the Ekman number.

4. Spherical shell geometry

The spherical shell is not tractable with the QG-model because β changes sign after going to inﬁnity. This implies

that Rossby waves will travel in opposite direction inside and outside the tangent cylinder.

We used the dynamo benchmark code [6] to perform a full 3D numerical calculation at E = 10−4.5. The critical

Rossby number we ﬁnd Roc = 0.16 is in very good agreement with the experimental one.

As far as we know, there is no spherical experiment looking for the destabilization of a Stewartson layer, so we

build our own.

C. Experimental study

1. Experimental setup

An axysymmetric ellipsoidal container which is very close to a sphere, contains water and is rotated by a motor
at variable angular speed Ω0. On this rotating frame, a small step-motor drives the inner axis diﬀerentially, at an
angular velocity ∆Ω. On that axis, we can attach an inner sphere or two disks, which is more tractable numerically.
Power and controls for the step-motor are passed from rotating frame into the lab-frame using a rotating electrical
slip ring. All dimensions are reported on ﬁgure 7, and further details can be found in [18].

To determine the stability threshold, we use a ﬂake solution (Kalliroscope AQ 1000) in combination with a projected
light slice. This allows us to see the shear-ﬁeld in a plane. When the shear-ﬁeld is steady, we assume that the ﬂow
is stable, and when the shear becomes unsteady (oscillations in time), the ﬂow is unstable. A few pictures of the
observed patterns are reproduced on ﬁgure 8. Many operators have done some calibration experiments to test the
high sensitivity on the determination of the onset.

The threshold is obtained for diﬀerent values of the Ekman number with two geometries and reported in tables V

and VI, for prograde diﬀerential rotation. Results for the stability threshold are summarized on ﬁgure 9.

The disk case seem to agree with the E1/2 scaling, whereas the sphere case is signiﬁcantly steeper. Both geometries
are very close suggesting that the same mechanism is at work. The numerical calculations for the disk model give too
low stability thresholds. This is probably because of the jump in height in the disk experiment that is not present in
the numerical model. Another possible cause could be the eﬀect of the E1/3-layer which is not present in the disks
numerical model. This will be investigated in §V B

For both numerical and experimental results we observe signiﬁcant discrepancies with the asymptotic laws, even

whith relatively small Ekman numbers. The next section will consider ﬁner eﬀects to correct the asymptotic laws.

We must now take care of what value of β comes into this expression. Actually, the shear layer samples the values
of β about ∆ around the split radius r0. We will assume that the largest sampled value of |β| is the one that enters
the equation, because the perturbation has to overcome that slope.

Assuming ∆ is small enough to use a taylor expansion

we obtain

keeping only the ﬁrst order correction in ∆.

It also explains the diﬀerence between positive and negative Rossby numbers. This asymmetry between positive and
negative diﬀerential rotation has never been pointed out in the previous linear theories.

The asymptotic base solution obtained by [22] contains a E1/3 (ﬁg. 1)shear layer, located inside the main goestrophic
E1/4 layer. This layer is not z-invariant, and is hence exluded by our QG-model. The base linar proﬁles given by our
QG-model (without this inner layer) are represented on ﬁgure 10. As we can see, the second radial derivative of the
ﬂow is discontinuous. The eﬀect of the E1/3 layer is to smooth out this discontinuity (see [15]), which directly aﬀects
the stability threshold.

A simple way to take this eﬀect into account is to average the ﬂow around the discontinuity. Neglecting the curvature

eﬀects, we have

The average value around r = 0 in a layer of width ∆′ ∼ E1/3 is then, at the ﬁrst non-vanishing order :

b is the correction due to the E1/3 layer, and we have b = 0 for QG-calculations but we expect b > 0 for the real ﬂow,
so that the threshold is higher than predicted by numerical simulations. In fact, the E1/3-layer reduces the maximum
by smoothing the singlularity. This implies an increased critical Rossby number. c± is the ﬁnite Rossby
values of

small values of E.

1. Back on the experiments

Looking carefuly at ﬁgure 9, one can notice diﬀerent things. On one hand, the disks case is well explained by an
E1/2 law, showing that the eﬀect of the E1/3-layer may be unimportant. On the other hand, an E7/12 law is in good
agreement with the stability threshold for the spherical shell geometry, suggesting that the eﬀect of the E1/3-layer
may be more important in that conﬁguration. This latter case is compared to full 3D numerical simulations, whereas
the disk case has been modelled using our QG-model, unable to take the jump at the disks edges (see ﬁg. 7) into
account. This may be responsible for the observed discrepancies.

The result of [11], Roc = 29E0.6 for a ﬂat container is close to E7/12. A slightly tilted top or bottom could explain

such result, which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the E3/4 law found by [17] and [9].

VI. RADIAL SCALINGS AT THE ONSET

A. Dependance on the sign of the Rossby number

We can observe on ﬁgure 6 that the instability develops in the inner region of the tangent cylinder for Ro < 0, and

in the outer one for Ro > 0. This is explained by a β-eﬀect on the instability, as represented on ﬁgure 12.

A vorticity sheet (the internal shear layer) is perturbed. The ﬂuid is slightly radialy displaced from its equilibrium
position. However, mass conservation and the Kelvin theorem impose that a column displaced toward a deeper region
is contracted and its vorticity gets stronger. We are in a low Rossby regime, so that the total vorticity is allways
positive (2Ω0 + ω > 0). If ω > 0 the local vorticity gets ampliﬁed, and if ω < 0 it is damped. This is exacltly the
conservation of potential vorticity.

For Ro > 0, the vorticity sheet is negative and thus the perturbation is damped in the deeper interior region,
In both cases, the ampliﬁed

whereas it is ampliﬁed in the outer shallow region. For Ro < 0, it is the opposite.
vorticity will induce a ﬂow which induces a drift of the pattern in the prograde direction (as for any Rossby wave).

B. Approximations and assumptions

On ﬁgure 6 the perturbation of the shear layer spreads across the whole volume whereas in the thermal convection
case [see 8] it is radialy localized. In this section we derive a simple heuristic model that predict all these properties
outside the shear layer.

To simplify our study, we make a few approximations :

• we neglect the curvature;

• we drop the viscous dissipation term, but keep the Ekman friction;

• we assume small forcing, ignoring the local vorticity term.

The curvature may be negligible if the scales involved are small enough. Looking at the results from section V, we
expect the scales to shrink while lowering the Ekman number. Thus, we replace the angular variable φ by y. Dropping
the viscous term lowers the order of the diﬀerential equation and make it easier to handle. Numerical simulations
with no viscous term or an artiﬁcially weakened viscous term show that the structure stays very similar. In addition,
the threshold is expected to be only slightly aﬀected in the asymptotic regime, as suggested by the results of table IV.
This is because the Ekman pumping does a comparable job. Finally, we can neglect the local vorticity term because
in the linear stability case it is a higher order eﬀect, as shown in section V A. We end up with

The expression of the Ekman friction involves several terms. We will only keep the vorticity contribution, so that

Inside this envelope, the radial length scale γ−1 of the perturbation decreases when β increases. This results from the
spiraling.

Using the scalings for the Stewartson layer instability k ∼ E−1/4 and ω ∼ E1/4, relation 45 leads to

which implies that the radial extension of the perturbation is independent of E. This is a fundamental diﬀerence with
the thermal convection case investigated by [24] and [12] where the scaling k ∼ E−1/3 and ω ∼ E1/3 implies

which corresponds to a slowly decaying radial extension when decreasing E. Note that Yano and Jones et al. dropped
the E1/2 pumping ﬂow, but kept the volume viscosity instead.

Inner part, small β

The inner part behaves exactly as the outer one, replacing ω by ω − RoU k. For a spherical shell it corresponds to

which actually exchanges the length scale of the exponential decay and of the oscillation compared to the outer region.
The solution for constant α and β is then

(cid:18)
which is an exponential decay of caracteristic length γ−1, inside which there are much larger length scale oscillations,
which cannot be detected.

(cid:19)

For the Rossby wave, we have ω ∼ k−1, so that γ ∼ k, with a correction independent of E. This shows that in the

small β case the critical mode has a radial extension comparable to its azimuthal scale.

E. Numerical results

We show on ﬁgure 13 a ﬁxed φ vorticity proﬁle. It shows that the vorticity gets ampliﬁed by the decreasing depth as
approaching the equator, while the spatial frequency of the oscillations increases, in aggreement with equation 44. In
addition even when decreasing E, the perturbation seems to spread across the whole depth of the tank, as predicted
by the scaling 46.

The scaling 44 is observed quantitatively in numerical simulations as shown on ﬁgure 14. On this curves we can
also see the eﬀect of the equatorial boundary, which modiﬁes the scaling. We also performed numerical calculations
with β independent of r. In that case there is no spiraling.

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we give a complete insight into the instability of a Stewartson shear layer.
The QG-model with the new pseudo-stream function formalism is designed for ﬁnite slopes, and is easy to implement.
Despite failing to describe the E1/3-layer, it has proven to be a good tool for numerical experiments to reach very low
Ekman numbers. It can also be used for non-linear calculations as long as the quasi-geostrophic hypothesis stands,
and may be useful for future ocean and planetary interior models.

Our model allows us to compare ﬂat top and bottom geometry with geometries containing a slope. Two diﬀerent

stabilizing processes are at work, leading to diﬀerent balance and scalings.

Combining theoretical, numerical and experimental approach allowed us to show how the presence of the E1/3-layer
aﬀects the threshold, and to propose a new asymptotic scaling (eq. 37), which seem to be accurate up to relatively
high Ekman numbers (E ≤ 10−5). It can be noted that the previous E1/2 asymptotic scaling is only valid for very
small Ekman numbers (E ≤ 10−8) that are diﬃcult to obtain in laboratory experiments, and that the Ekman pumping
plays a signiﬁcant role, even at very low Ekman numbers.

The radial structure shows similarities with thermal convection as well as fundamental diﬀerences. In particular, if
the global structure of the ﬂow is quite similar to the spiraling ﬂow of Busse, the radial extension of the instability is
surprisingly independent of the Ekman number.

The non-linear and turbulent regime has to be investigated, by means of numerical calculations and quantitative
velocity measurement in experiments. We also expect these ﬂow to induce magnetic ﬁeld. Future sodium experiments,
as well as dynamo calculations will shed some light on this process.

APPENDIX A: EKMAN PUMPING IN A SPHERE

The Ekman pumping ﬂow is given by [10]

u.n|±L =

E1/2

|n.ez| !

with n the outward unit vector normal to the surface and u the velocity jump between the geostrophic interior and
the boundaries. This Ekman pumping ﬂow is the next order term in the E1/2 developement, and is deduced from the
quasi-geostrophic, 0-order ﬂow. However, it has a dynamic action on that ﬂow, and is thus important for the dynamics
of the system. For simplicity we assume that the boundaries are at rest in the rotating frame. It is straightforward
to apply the result to moving boundaries by replacing the velocity by the jump in velocity.

uθ = ur cos θ − uz sin θ

ρ cos θ = z
uρ = ur sin θ + uz cos θ

It has to be emphasized that this results from a development in E1/2, which is no more valid when approaching the
equator.

In the expression A7, we have an order E1/2 and order 1 term. The development is no more valid when these two
terms are of the same order of magnitude. Setting r = 1 − ǫ, we have 1 − r2 ∼ 2ǫ. Keeping the dominant terms in

Abstract
The mean-eddy interaction in a ﬂow is investigated in terms of the energy transfer between
its mean and eddy processes. In the Reynolds decomposition framework, the classical energetics
formalism does not have the transfer faithfully represented: Energy transferred from the mean
process to the eddy process is not equal in amount to the energy transferred in the opposite
direction. As a result, the classical “Reynolds stress extraction”, R = −v′v′ : ∇¯v, cannot be used
to measure the mean-eddy interaction, or turbulence production/laminarization in the context of
turbulence research. This paper shows that a faithful formalism can be rigorously established
within the same framework. The resulting transfer sums to zero everywhere over the decomposed
subspaces, representing a mere redistribution of energy between the mean and eddy processes,
without generating or destroying energy as a whole. For this reason, it has been referred to as
perfect transfer in distinction from other energy transfers one may have encountered. The perfect
transfer has a simple form in expression, with the introduction of an eddy ﬂow coupled with the
mean and eddy processes of the ﬁeld under concern. The eddy or turbulence production is then
totally determined by the divergence of this ﬂow. This formalism has been validated with a well-
known barotropic instability model, the Kuo model for the stability of the zonal atmospheric jet
stream. We see a distribution of perfect transfer consistent with the instability scenario inferred
based on Kuo’s theorem, while the traditional Reynolds stress extraction R does not agree with
the inference. The formalism has also been validated with a wake control problem. It is found that
placement of a control to defeat the positive perfect transfer Γ (mean-to-eddy transfer) will yield the
most eﬃcient control in terms of energy saving, in comparison to the ineﬃcient control placement
based on R or eddy energy growth. This research is expected to be useful for the harnessing of
turbulence, in that it may help to identify the best locations to place passive controls, or design
the performance functional for active controls.

INTRODUCTION

The mean-eddy interaction in ﬂuid ﬂows is an important problem in ﬂuid mechanics.
Related to it are hydrodynamic stability, turbulence production, laminarization, atmospheric
cyclogenesis, hurricane generation, ocean eddy shedding, to name but a few. Central to the
problem is the transfer of energy between the mean and eddy processes as decomposed
(cf. Fig. 1). The purpose of this paper is to quantify this transfer within the traditional
Reynolds decomposition framework, and use it to investigate a new strategy of ﬂuid control.
In a forthcoming paper, this formalism will be extended to a more generic framework for real-
time problems (Liang et al., manuscript submitted to SIAM J. Multiscale Model. Simul.)

FIG. 1: A schematic of the mean-eddy interaction, which is characterized by the energy transfer
Γ between the mean and eddy processes.

The classical formalism of energy transfer can be best illustrated with the Reynolds
decomposed equations for the advection of a scalar ﬁeld T = ¯T + T ′ in an incompressible
ﬂow v, where the overbar stands for an ensemble mean, and the prime for the departure
from the mean. In the absence of diﬀusion, T evolves as

whose decomposed equations are

∂t

+ ∇ · (vT ) = 0,

Multiplying (2a) by ¯T , and (2b) by T ′, and taking the mean, one arrives at the evolutions
of the mean energy and eddy energy (variance)[1][2]

The terms in divergence form are generally understood as the transports of the mean and
eddy energies, and those on the right hand side as the respective energy transfers. The latter

are usually used to explain the mean-eddy interaction. Particularly, when T is a velocity
component, the right hand side of (3b) has been interpreted as the rate of energy extracted
by Reynolds stress, or “Reynolds stress extraction” for short, against the mean ﬁeld to fuel
the eddy growth; in the context of turbulence research, it is also referred to as the “rate of
turbulence production”.

An observation of the two “transfer terms” on the right hand sides of (3) is that they
are not symmetric; in other words, they do not cancel out each other. In fact, they sum to
∇ · ( ¯T v′T ′), which in general does not vanish. This is not what one expects, as physically
a transfer process should be a mere redistribution of energy between the mean and eddy
processes, without destroying or generating energy as a whole. These two quantities therefore
are not real transfers, and cannot be used to measure the mean-eddy interaction.

The reason for the asymmetry between the terms on the right hand side of (3) is that
they are intertwined with transport processes; or alternatively, the divergence terms on the
left hand side do not account for all the ﬂuxes. Some people such as Pope[3] add an extra
term in the ﬂux term of (3a) to maintain the balance, but it is not clear how that term
should be chosen on physical grounds. Pedlosky[4] pointed out that a partial solution of
the problem is to take averages for these terms over a substantially large domain. This
way the transport contributions may be reduced and hence the transfer stands out. Liang
and Robinson[5] argued that spatial averages should be avoided to retain the information
of spatial intermittency in the energetics. They believed that a precise separation between
the transport and transfer can be made to satisfy the above symmetric requirement. They
even named the transfer thus obtained perfect transfer, in distinction from other transfers
that may have been called in the literature. But in their paper a rigorous formalization was
postponed to future work; how the separation can be achieved is still open,

This study intends to give this problem a solution in the traditional framework. A
complete answer to the issue of separation raised in [5], which is based on a new mathematical
apparatus, the multiscale window transform developed by Liang and Anderson (manuscript
submitted to SIAM J. Multiscale Model. Simul.), is deferred to the sequel to this paper.
The following two sections are devoted to the establishment of a rigorous formalism for
the transfer Γ. We ﬁrst consider the case for a scalar ﬁeld T (II), and then extend to
momentum equations (III). The formalism is validated with a well-studied instability model
of an atmospheric jet stream (section IV), and applied to harness the Karman vortex street
behind a circular cylinder (V). A brief summary is presented in section VI.

II. FORMALISM WITH A PASSIVE SCALAR

A. Reynolds decomposition

The transfer is sought within the Reynolds decomposition framework. The key of the
Reynolds decomposition is Reynolds averaging. It decomposes a ﬁeld, for example a scalar
ﬁeld T , into a mean ¯T plus a departure from the mean, T ′. Simple as it is, Reynolds averaging
actually introduces an important geometric structure which, as we will see shortly, helps to
make the transfer problem easier.

A Reynolds average may be understood either as an ensemble mean, or an expectation
with respect to the measure of probability. Practically it may also be understood as an
average in time or an average in some dimension of space.
Its basic properties include:
(1) T ′ = 0, (2) αT = α ¯T , for α = const, and a corollary from the above two, (3) ¯T T ′ =

3

¯T (T ′) = 0. To put all these understandings together, the decomposition can be recast in
the framework of a Hilbert space H, with an inner product deﬁned as,

hf, gi = f g,

(4)

for any f and g in the space H, that is, the ensemble, the probability space, or the space of
functions over the time or spatial domain under consideration, if the overbar is, respectively,
an ensemble mean, a probability expectation, or a time/spatial average. (It is interesting
to note that the meaning of a Reynolds averaging is two-fold: one is the mean state recon-
struction, another the summation or integration operator in forming the inner product.)

A Reynolds decomposition thus splits H into two subspaces, which contain the mean
process and the eddy process. We will refer to these subspaces as windows, so we have a
mean window and an eddy window. Distinguish them respectively with subscripts 0 and 1.
Correspondingly the decomposed components of a ﬁeld T , ¯T and T ′, will be alternatively
written as [T ]0 and [T ]1 for convenience. Using these notations, the energy of T on window
2h[T ]k, [T ]ki; the property ¯T T ′ = 0 becomes h[T ]0, [T ]1i = 0, implying
k as deﬁned in (3) is 1
the two windows are orthogonal. The concept of orthogonal windows puts the mean and
eddy ﬁelds on the same footing, and will help to greatly simplify the derivation.

B. Multiscale ﬂux

An important step toward the solution of the transfer problem is ﬁnding the ﬂuxes, and
hence the transports, on the two scale windows. The (¯v ¯T 2/2) and (vT ′
2/2) in (3a) and
(3b), though seemingly in ﬂux forms, are not really the desiderata in a rigorous physical
sense. One may see this through a simple argument of energy conservation, which requires
that the mean and eddy ﬂuxes sum to (vT 2/2)–clearly these two quantities do not meet the
requirement.

On the other hand, the concept of multiscale ﬂux can be naturally introduced within
the formalized Reynolds decomposition framework. Given a ﬂow v, the ﬂux of an inner
product hf, gi over H is hvf, gi = hf, vgi (v is self-adjoint with respect to h·, ·i). (Note
the ﬂux is uniquely represented this way. The only other choice one might propose for the
representation is hv, f gi. This, however, does not make sense in physics, as a ﬂow v is an
operator, not a function of the same like as f and g in the functional space.) Let f = g = T
,
√2
one obtains the ﬂux of energy

Q =

hvT, T i.

Geometrically, the right hand side of (5) shows a projection of (vT ) onto T . The ﬂux on
window k then should be a projection of vT onto [T ]k:

Q

k =

hvT, [T ]ki =

h[vT ]k, [T ]ki.

In arriving at the last result we have used the fact that the two windows are orthogonal.

This is the very conservation requirement mentioned above.

C. Perfect transfer

Continue to examine the evolution of T in an incompressible ﬂow v. In the language

introduced in subsection II A, Eqs. (2a) and (2b) can be written in a uniﬁed form:

∂[T ]k
∂t

+ ∇ · [vT ]k = 0,

for windows k = 0, 1. Here the decomposition is performed only in a statistical sense. That
is to say, the mean is an ensemble mean or a probability expectation. But as we will see
toward the end of this section, the formalism of energy transfer is essentially the same with
respect to other methods of averaging.

Application of h[T ]k, ·i to (7) gives the energy evolution equation on window k:

∂ 1

2 h[T ]k, [T ]ki
∂t

+ h[T ]k, ∇ · [vT ]ki = 0.

The nonlinear term (second part on the l.h.s) involves two interwoven processes: transport
and transfer. The former integrates to zero over a closed spatial domain; the latter sums to
zero over k, k = {0, 1}. That is to say, (8) can be symbolically written as,

∂ 1

2h[T ]k, [T ]ki
∂t

= −∇ · Q

k + Γk,

where Q
subspace.

k is the ﬂux on window k, and Γk the transfer to window k from its complementary

We already know the multiscale ﬂux Q

k in (6). The transfer Γk is now easy to derive.

Comparing (9) with (8), one obtains

Γk − ∇ · Q

k = −h[T ]k, ∇ · [vT ]ki.

Substitution of (6) immediately gives

Γk =

∇ · h[vT ]k, [T ]ki − h[T ]k, ∇ · [vT ]ki.

It would be more clear to see the mean-eddy interaction if (11) is rewritten in the tra-
ditional overbar/prime notation. For the eddy process (k = 1), the transfer from the mean
ﬂow is

In the derivation, the incompressibility assumption ∇·v = 0, and hence ∇· ¯v = 0, ∇·v′ = 0,

Equations (13) and (14) imply an important property for the transfer derived above,

Γk = 0.

Xk

That is to say, the transfer thus obtained is a process of energy redistribution between the
windows; there is no energy generated or destroyed as a whole, just as one may expect. To
distinguish from other energy transfers one may have encountered in the literature, we will
refer to Γ as perfect transfer, a term adopted from [5], when confusion might arise.

Note the distinct diﬀerence between Γ and the Reynolds stress extraction as appears in
(3b), R = −v′T ′ · ∇ ¯T , which traditionally has been used to interpret the generation of
eddy events, and has been interpreted as, in the turbulence research context, the turbulence
production rate. In sections IV and V, we will see that these two are in general diﬀerently
distributed in space and time.

The transfer Γ may be further simpliﬁed in expression. If ¯T 6= 0, (13) may be alternatively

written as

Observe that the quantity in the parenthesis has the dimension of velocity. It represents
a ﬂow coupled with the mean and eddy processes of T . For convenience, introduce a “T -
coupled eddy velocity”

The T -coupled eddy ﬂow vT is introduced for notational simplicity and for physical
understanding. One should be aware that Γ is well deﬁned, even though vT does not exist
when ¯T = 0. In that case, the original expression (13) should be used.

D. Other methods of averaging

Practically the Reynolds averaging is often performed with respect to time if the process
is stationary, or some dimension of space if the process in homogeneous in that dimension.
If the averaging is in time, the above derivations also apply, except that the time derivatives
in (7), (8), (17a), and (17b) are gone. The transfer Γ is still in the same form as (13).

If the averaging is performed in a dimension of space, say, in x, then the above derivation
∂x. But we have the following
∂x = 0, for any ﬁeld ψ. These substituted into the continuity
∂z = 0. With these identities, we repeat the procedures

needs modiﬁcation, as the averaging does not commute with ∂
extra properties: ∂ψ
∂y + ∂ ¯w
equation ∇ · v = 0 yield ∂ ¯u
in the above subsection, and obtain:

∂x = 0, ∂ψ

∂x = ∂ ¯v

Γ =

1
2

¯T ∇yz · (v′T ′) − (v′T ′) · ∇yz ¯T
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

.

Here ∇yz = j ∂

∂y + k ∂

∂z is the ∇ operator with the x component removed.

Notice that u′T ′ and ¯T are independent of x, viz
∂ ¯T
∂x (cid:19)

∂u′T ′
∂x

− (u′T ′)

1
2 (cid:18)

¯T

= 0.

So we may add the left hand side of (23) to (22) to get

Γ =

1
2

¯T ∇ · (v′T ′) − (v′T ′) · ∇ ¯T
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

,

which is precisely the same as (13) in expression form.

In a brief summary, we have derived the mean-eddy energy transfer for a passive scalar
in an incompressible ﬂow, which is “perfect” in the sense that the energy extracted from
the mean is equal in amount to the energy released by the mean. The perfect transfer is
invariant in expression form with averaging schemes.

III. FORMALISM WITH MOMENTUM EQUATIONS

We need to deal with momentum equations for the mean-eddy kinetic energy transfer.

Consider an incompressible ideal ﬂow v. It is governed by

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25a)

(25b)

In forming the multiscale energy equations, the pressure term only contributes to the trans-
port, i.e., the resulting pressure work is in a divergence form, thanks to the incompressibility

+ ∇ · (vv) = −∇P,

∂v
∂t
∇ · v = 0,

7

assumption. So only the nonlinear terms require some thought in deriving the perfect trans-
fer.

In this case, the formalism with the momentum equations is then essentially the same as
that with the evolution of a passive scalar, except that we now have three “scalars” for the
three velocity components u, v, and w. If ¯u 6= 0, ¯v 6= 0, and ¯w 6= 0, for each component,
v′u′
there is a “coupled eddy velocity” deﬁned by (20), so we have vu, vv, and vw, which are
¯u ,
v′w′
v′v′
¯w , respectively. According to the preceding section, each velocity corresponds to
¯v , and
a transfer as expressed by (21). The total kinetic energy transfer is thence the sum of all
the three transfers:

Γ =

1
2

¯u2∇ · vu + ¯v2∇ · vv + ¯w2∇ · vw
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

.

As noted in subsection II C, the above formula is well deﬁned even when the mean velocity

vanishes. In that case, one just needs to expand it to obtain:

where the second term in the curly braces is the very Reynolds stress extraction:

Γ =

∇ · (v′v′) · ¯v − (v′v′) : ∇¯v

,

(cid:9)

1
2

(cid:8)

R = −(v′v′) : ∇¯v.

Like those with a scalar ﬁeld, these formulas stay invariant in form, no matter what an
averaging scheme is adopted.

IV. VALIDATION WITH AN INSTABILITY MODEL

In this section, the above formalism of perfect transfer Γ is validated with an idealized
instability model. We will also see through this concrete example how Γ diﬀers from the
classical Reynolds stress extraction against the basic proﬁle.

Consider a well-studied barotropic instability model, the Kuo model, for the instability of
the zonal atmospheric jet stream[6][7]. Liang and Robinson[8] have constructed a particular
solution with a highly localized structure which is ideal for our purpose here. In the following
we brieﬂy present this solution, and then calculate the transfer (27).

Choose a coordinate frame with x pointing eastward, y northward. The governing equa-
tions for the Kuo model are the 2D version of (25), but with a Coriolis force term f k ∧ v (f
constant) on the left hand side. The domain is periodic in x, and limited within latitudes
y = ±L, where a slip boundary condition v = 0 is applied. As rotation makes no contri-
bution to the energy evolution, the formulas established in section (III) equally apply here,
i.e., the Kuo model can be used for the validation.
Assume a basic velocity proﬁle (cf. Fig. 2a)

theorem (ibid). Decompose the ﬂow as

2 , meeting the necessary condition for instability by Rayleigh’s

and substitute back to the governing equations. Kuo considered only the initial stage of
instability when the perturbation ﬁeld (u′, v′) is very small. So the resulting equations can
be linearized. Assuming a solution of the form

(u, v) = (¯u(y), 0) + (u′, v′),

(u′, v′) = (˜u(y), ˜v(y))eik(x

one obtains an eigenvalue problem

with boundary conditions

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

The solution of (33) is not repeated here; the reader may refer to Kuo’s original papers for
details.

Kuo showed that, in addition to the qy inﬂection requirement, the diﬀerence (¯u − cr)
(cr = Re{c} the mode phase velocity) must be positively correlated with ¯qy over [−L, L] in
order for the perturbation to destabilize the jet. In other words, for an instability to occur,
it requires that

(1) ¯qy change sign through y ∈ [−L, L] (Rayleigh’ theorem);

(2) (¯u − cr) and ¯qy be positively correlated over [−L, L] (Kuo’s theorem).

9

Hence the zero points of (¯u − cr) and ¯qy are critical. We will validate our transfer formal-
ism through examining the instability structures near these critical points. We choose a
particular unstable mode (and hence a particular cr) to fulﬁll the objective.

As shown in [8], the wavenumber k = 3
4

π
L gives such a mode; it lies within the unstable
regime as computed by Kuo[7]. In fact, if substituting back into the eigenvalue problem,
one obtains, using the shooting method[9],

c = cr + ici = (0.4504 + 0.0476i)¯umax,

(35)

yielding a positive growth rate kci > 0. Solved in the mean time is the corresponding
eigenvector ˜v, which substituted in (32) and the governing equations give a solution of all
the ﬁelds. The resulting phase speed cr = 0.4504¯umax and the gradient of the basic potential
vorticity ¯qy give four critical values of y:

¯u(y) − cr = 0 =⇒ y = ±0.53L,
¯qy = −¯uyy = 0 =⇒ y = ±0.50L.

(36)

The four critical latitudes, as marked in Fig. 2b, partitions the y dimension into ﬁve
distinct regimes characterized by diﬀerent values of K ≡ ¯qy(¯u − cr). For most of y ∈ [−L, l],
K > 0, but the positivity is interrupted by two narrow strips near y = ±L/2, where K < 0.
This scenario has profound implications by Kuo’s theorem. Although Kuo’s theorem is
stated in a global form, it should hold locally within the correlation scale. In the present
example, that means one of the necessary conditions for barotropic instability is not met
around the strips and so there should be no instability occurring there.

Instability means a transfer of energy from the background to the perturbation ﬁeld,
namely, a positive Γ. Using the particular solution obtained above, we compute the transfer
from (27). We adopt a zonal averaging, i.e., averaging in x, to fulﬁll the decomposition.

10

This is because, (1) ¯u itself does not have x-dependence and hence can be understood as an
x-average, and (2) the solution is homogeneous in x due to the cyclic boundary condition.
The computation is straightforward. The result is plotted in Fig. 3a. Sure enough, Γ is not
positive around the two narrow strips; in fact, there is a strong negative transfer, i.e., upscale
or inverse transfer from the eddy window to the background. Moreover, the negative transfer
is limited within two narrow regimes, just as one may expect by Kuo’s theorem. In contrast,
a diﬀerent scenario is seen on the proﬁle of the conventional Reynolds stress extraction R,
which we plot in Fig. 3b. R is nonnegative throughout [−L, L]; particularly, it is maximally
positive over the narrow strip regimes, countering our foregoing intuitive argument. Through
this example, our perfect transfer Γ results in a scenario agreeing well with the analytical
result of the Kuo model, while the conventional Reynolds stress extraction R does not.

V. APPLICATION TO THE SUPPRESSION OF EDDY SHEDDING

A practical application of the above research is turbulence control. Turbulence control is
a technique to manipulate turbulence growth to achieve the goal of drag reduction (cf. [10]
and particularly the celebrated paper by Kim[11], and the references therein). How the
current research may come to help is to provide a better object, i.e., the perfect transfer, to
manipulate, in place of the growth of turbulence energy or eddy energy.

The proposal is out of the concern of how to maximally take advantage of the processes
of self-laminarization or relaminarization that may occur within a turbulent ﬂow. In the
interest of energy saving, suppression of the positive transfer Γ [cf. (27)] is preferred to
suppression of the eddy energy growth to inhibit the production of turbulence. To see
why, observe that eddy energy increase does not necessarily occur in accordance with a
positive transfer, and hence a place where turbulence grows does not necessarily correspond
to turbulence production. Actually, the correspondence is an exception rather than a rule.
(Later in this section we will see an example.) The energy needed to fuel the growth could
be transported from the neighborhood, rather than released in situ. One possibility is,
while disturbances rapidly grow, a process of laminarization could be undergoing at the
very position. As shown in the two-point system in Fig. 4, while disturbances grow at both
A and B (both K eddy
increase), the eddy energy is produced at A only. At B,
not only there is no eddy energy production, but the transfer is from the eddy window to
the mean window. That is to say, the system is undergoing a laminarization at B, even
though the eddy energy K eddy
grows, because of a surplus of the inﬂux of eddy energy over
the inverse transfer. Control of the eddy energy growth at both A and B indeed helps to
suppress the onset of turbulence, but it is not optimal in terms of energy saving. Suppression
of K eddy
defeats the intrinsic trend of laminarization in the mean time, and therefore reduces
B
the control performance. To take advantage of this laminarization, the control should be
applied at position A, i.e., the source region, only, and the optimal objective functional
should be designed with respect to ΓA, rather than K eddy

and K eddy

In this spirit, we demonstrate the application by showing how one may eﬃciently suppress
the vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder. Vortex suppression is important in that it can
result in signiﬁcant drag reduction and hence energy saving; it may also be used to reduce
noise. Presented in the following are just some diagnostic results with a saturated wake
to which the afore-established formalism is applicable; the same example will be studied in
more detail in the sequel to this paper with nonstationarity considered. We will deal with a
laminar case only, but the idea equally applies to turbulent wakes.

transfer is toward the mean at position B, but K eddy

There are many sophisticated techniques to suppress the shedding of vortices in a wake
[cf. [12] and [13] and the references therein]. Surface-based suction is one of them. To our
knowledge, the research along this line thus far, however, has been focused on the technique
per se. No report has been found on the issue of where to place the suction to optimize the
performance. In the following, we will show that our formalism of mean-eddy interaction
and perfect transfer can give this question an answer.

Consider a planar ﬂow passing around a circular cylinder. The governing equations are
the same as those of Eqs. (25), except that dissipation is included. The computational
domain is plotted in Fig. 5, with x and y nondimensionalized by the cylinder diameter d. A
uniform inﬂow (U, 0) is speciﬁed at x = −2.5, and on the right open boundary (x = 37.5)
a radiative condition[14] is applied. At y = ±4 are two solid boundaries, where nonslip
conditions are imposed.

We examine a ﬂow with Reynolds number Re = U d

ν = 200. The spacing choice of ∆x and
∆y is found not a stringent constraint. By experiments a mesh with ∆x = ∆y = 0.05 and a
mesh with ∆x = ∆y = 0.025 produce little diﬀerence in the ﬁnal result for our problem. We
thus choose ∆x = ∆y = 0.05 for economic reason. The governing equations are integrated
forward on a staggered grid[15] using a semi-implicit (implicit for pressure) ﬁnite diﬀerence
scheme (e.g., [16]) of the second order in both time and space.

The model is run until a statistical equilibrium is reached. After that, it is integrated fur-
ther for 100 time units and the outputs are used to calculate the transfer Γ. The stationarity
in time makes it a natural choice to perform time averaging in computing the transfer (27).
The computation is straightforward. We plot the result in Fig. 6. Note the time interval is

large enough that one virtually sees no diﬀerence in the computed result if it is enlarged.

FIG. 6: Perfect transfer Γ in the wake behind a cylinder (units in U 3/d).

By (27), a positive Γ means eddy energy generation or turbulence production in turbu-
lence research, while a negative Γ indicates a transfer in the opposite direction. In Fig. 6,
two triangular lobes of strong positive Γ sit on either side of the axis y = 0, with a weak
negative center lying in the near wake. That is to say, eddy energy is generated within
the two lobes, while in between is a laminarization process. By the forgoing arguments, an
eﬃcient control strategy should be the one inhibiting the positive Γ in these two lobes. Since
we are considering only the technique of surface-based suction, the Γ distribution suggests
that application of suctions near the two lobes should be eﬀective. In doing this, one can
simultaneously take advantage of the laminarization process occurring in the near wake.
Indeed, our control experiments show that the areas between 50 to 80 degrees and between
−50 to −80 degrees from the x-axis are the eﬀective suction locations to suppress the vortex
street. The eﬀectiveness, according to [13], may be measured by a suction rate cq = m
U d,
where m is the mass ﬂow rate, U the free stream velocity, and d the cylinder diameter. By
experiments, the most eﬀective control is that placed at ±70o, following the same orienta-
tion of the two positive Γ lobes. Only a rate of cq = 0.18 can have the vortices completely
suppressed (e.g., Fig. 7). In contrast, controls in areas below 50 degrees and above −50
degrees are counterproductive, as the near wake laminarization process is defeated.

t = 50 and so forth.

It is of interest to see how other diagnostic ﬁelds, such as the eddy energy 1

and R, are distributed. Shown in Figs. 8a and b are these ﬁelds. Clearly, they both attain
their maxima along the axis y = 0, a scenario completely diﬀerent from that of Γ in Fig. 6.
If the control is based on these ﬁelds, a suction should be placed at (x, y) = ( 1
2, 0), i.e., 0o
from the axis. But, as noted above, the control experiments show this does not result in an
eﬀective vortex suppression.

The success of the control experiment serves to validate our formalism of the mean-eddy
interaction and the equations of Γ, (13) and (27). In the mean time, a variety of ﬂuid control
problems, both active and passive, may beneﬁt from this formalism.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the Reynolds decomposition framework, the mean-eddy interaction has been rigor-
ously formulated in terms of energy transfer, which can be singled out from the intertwined
nonlinear processes by eliminating the transport eﬀect. The resulting transfer sums to zero
over the two decomposed subapces, or windows as called in the text. In other words, the

14

transfer represents a redistribution process between the mean and eddy windows, without
generating or destroying energy as a whole. Because of this property, it is sometimes referred
to as perfect transfer in distinction from other transfers that one may have encountered in
the literature.

The perfect transfer from the mean process to the eddy process can be explicitly written
out. In the case of a scalar T advected by an incompressible ﬂow v, traditionally there is a
quantity

which, when T is a velocity component, has been explained as the rate of energy extracted
by Reynolds stress against the basic proﬁle. We showed that this is not the eddy energy
transferred from the mean to the eddy windows. The real transfer should be

completely controlled by the divergence of this ﬂow. This simple formalism can be easily
generalized to those with momentum equations.
In that case, the perfect transfer is a
redistribution of kinetic energy between the mean and the eddy windows. The resulting
transfer is referred to (27). For all the averaging schemes, it has the same form.

The formalism has been validated with a well-known barotropic instability model, the
Kuo model for the stability of a zonal atmospheric jet stream. Instability implies energy
transfer from the background to perturbation, or mean to eddy in this context. We have
seen a scenario of perfect transfer consistent with that inferred based on Kuo’s theorem,
while the traditional Reynolds stress extraction does not agree with the inference.

An intuitive argument regarding the perfect transfer Γ is that the distribution of Γ is
generally not in accordance to that of eddy energy or eddy energy growth, due to the
presence of transport processes. This has been testiﬁed in the wake control experiment.
In the context of turbulence, that is to say, the rapid growth of turbulent energy does not
necessarily correspond to turbulence production. It is not uncommon that, at a location
where perturbation is growing, the underlying process could be a transfer in the inverse
direction, i.e., a laminarization. This argument has profound implication in real applications.
Turbulence control is such an example. It suggests the optimal location to place a control
be that of positive Γ, rather than that of turbulence growth, in order to take the advantage
of the self-laminarization within a turbulent ﬂow. This conjecture has been testiﬁed in an
exercise of vortex shedding suppression with a cylinder wake. By computation there are
two lobes of strong positive Γ attaching to the cylinder on either side. We tried a surface-
based suction on many places of the cylinder, but the most eﬀective places are those where

15

the transfer processes within these two lobes are easiest to defeat. Other places are not as
eﬀective as these two, in terms of energy saving.

The success of the wake suppression experiment implies the physically robust quantity Γ
may be useful for a variety of ﬂuid control problems. Speciﬁcally, it may come to help in
selecting the location(s) to place a passive control, or designing the performance functional
for an active control. The above experiment is an example for the former; for the latter,
we should be able to design some transfer-oriented functional for the optimization. As we
argued before, this should be advantageous over those based on turbulence growth in light
of energy saving.

It should be pointed out that, in realistic ﬂows, the signals are generally not stationary,
nor homogeneous, and as a result, the Reynolds averaging cannot be replaced with an
averaging over time or a spatial dimension. In such cases, the mean and eddy ﬁelds are not
as simple as thus reconstructed; the mean itself can be time varying. Besides, interactions
may not be limited just between two windows. A common process, mean-eddy-turbulence
interaction, for example, requires three distinct windows for a faithful representation. All
these diﬃculties will be overcome, and a new real problem-oriented formalism will be realized
in a forthcoming paper after the introduction of a new analysis apparatus, multiscale window
transform, to replace the Reynolds averaging technique for a realistic mean-eddy-turbulence
decomposition.

Abstract. Exact structure function equations are an eﬃcient means of
obtaining asymptotic laws such as inertial range laws, as well as all measurable
eﬀects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy that cause deviations from such laws.
“Exact” means that the equations are obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation
or other hydrodynamic equations without any approximation. A pragmatic
deﬁnition of local homogeneity lies within the exact equations because terms
that explicitly depend on the rate of change of measurement location appear
within the exact equations; an analogous statement is true for local stationarity.
An exact deﬁnition of averaging operations is required for the exact equations.
Careful derivations of several inertial range laws have appeared in the literature
recently in the form of theorems. These theorems give the relationships of
the energy dissipation rate to the structure function of acceleration increment
multiplied by velocity increment and to both the trace of and the components of
the third-order velocity structure functions. These laws are eﬃciently derived
In some respects, the

results obtained herein diﬀer from the previous theorems. The acceleration-
velocity structure function is useful for obtaining the energy dissipation rate
in particle tracking experiments provided that the eﬀects of inhomogeneity are
estimated by means of displacing the measurement location.

1 Introduction

Energy dissipation rate ε is used for scaling the turbulence acceleration
statistics that are measured by particle tracking at Cornell University[1]. The
inertial range of the second-order velocity structure function is measured in the
Cornell apparatus to determine ε using the empirical inertial-range relationship
In the Cornell experiments the ﬂow between

counter rotating blades produces high Reynolds numbers but inhomogeneous,
anisotropic turbulence. A motivation for the present study was to use the
exact velocity structure-function equation[2] to relate ε to measurable quantities
without making any assumptions about homogeneity or isotropy of the ﬂow and
hence, to obtain a relationship that applies exactly to the need to determine ε in
the Cornell experiment. By “exact” we mean that the equations follow from the
Navier-Stokes equation and the incompressibility condition with no additional
approximations. Because particle tracking is used at Cornell University to
measure acceleration and velocity, it is natural to relate the acceleration-velocity
structure function (i.e., the structure function of the product of acceleration and
velocity increments) to both ε and the third-order velocity structure function.

1

On the basis of local homogeneity, but without use of local isotropy, Mann, Ott
and Andersen[3, 4] were the ﬁrst to obtain an inertial-range relationship of the
acceleration-velocity structure function to ε. By specializing our exact equation
for the acceleration-velocity structure function to the locally homogeneous case,
we eﬃciently obtain their inertial-range result in Sec. 4, but an extraneous
derivative moment in their relationship is removed here. The exact structure
function equation method given here not only obtains that asymptotic law, but
also shows all quantities that must be evaluated to account for the eﬀects of
inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Such evaluation requires the displacement of
the measurement volume that is deﬁned by the Cornell laser beam and imaging
system.

The theorems of Nie and Tanveer[5] and of Duchon and Robert[6] es-
tablish the inertial-range 4/3 law that relates ε to the trace of the third-order
velocity structure function.
Instead of invoking local homogeneity, Nie and
Tanveer[5] perform a large volume average, and perform a long time average
instead of invoking local stationarity, and they use an average over orientations
of the two measurement points instead of invoking local isotropy. Results of Nie
and Tanveer[5] are eﬃciently obtained in Sec. 5 by use of the exact structure
function equation. For the case of spatially periodic direct numerical simula-
tion, similar results were obtained from the exact structure function equations
in [2].

The theorem of Duchon and Robert[6] diﬀers from that of Nie and

Duchon and Robert is of arbitrary extent and the viscosity is zero.
In Sec.
6, using space-time averaging and the limit of very large Reynolds number, the
4/3 law is obtained from the exact statistical equations. The present derivation
requires conditions on the space-time average as stated in Sec. 6 All terms that
describe the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of ﬂows are retained. That result
shows all quantities that should be evaluated in direct numerical simulation
(DNS) of ﬂows to determine causes of deviation from the 4/3 law.

The inertial-range 4/3 relationship of the trace of the third-order veloc-
ity structure function is easily obtained relative to the inertial-range 4/5 and
4/15 laws for the longitudinal and transverse components of the third-order ve-
It is remarkable that the 4/5 and 4/15

laws were obtained by Nie and Tanveer[5] on the same basis as described above,
and remarkable that the 4/5 and 4/15 laws were also proven by Eyink[7] on a
basis similar to that of Duchon and Robert[6], that is, for space-time averaging
of arbitrary extent in the limit of vanishing viscosity. Those 4/5 and 4/15
laws are not derived here. Eyink[7] ﬁnds that tests of the inertial-range power
laws for arbitrary extent of averaging would be diﬃcult. On the other hand,
evaluation of all terms in an exact statistical equation by means of DNS data
would show causes of deviations from those laws as well as the approach toward
those laws.

Of course, real experiments do not provide the opportunity to perform
the above mentioned averaging used in the derivation of the theorems for the
inertial-range laws. Deviations from 4/5 and 4/15 laws are observed because of

2

turbulence inhomogeneity, anisotropy, and ﬁnite Reynolds number. Recently,
there has been much work [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] on quantifying terms in the
velocity structure function equations to learn how the various terms aﬀect the
balance of the equation as a function of scale and at what scales the eﬀects of
inhomogeneity and anisotropy become pronounced and how asymptotic laws are
approached. The exact structure function equations are useful in this regard
because they retain all eﬀects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy in a clearly
organized manner. The exact equations obviate the need for many derivations
that obtain some limited aspect of inhomogeneity. Those developments are
discussed in Sec. 7. The deﬁnition of local homogeneity that directly simpliﬁes
exact structure function equations is that the rate of change of statistics with
respect to where they are measured is negligible. That pragmatic deﬁnition is
explained and contrasted with previous deﬁnitions in Sec. 2.

2 Pragmatic deﬁnition of local homogeneity

Exact statistical hydrodynamics involves the derivation of equations relat-
ing statistics without the use of approximations. The Navier-Stokes equation
has been used to derive exact equations relating velocity structure functions
of velocity increments and other statistics[2]. Such exact equations have been
obtained for all orders of velocity structure functions in [14]. Structure func-
tion equations of all orders have also been given for the asymptotic case of local
isotropy in [14] and [15]. The exact equation for the scalar structure function
has been obtained from the continuity equation as well[16]. All such exact
equations have optimal organization when the independent variables are chosen
to be the spatial separation r ≡ x − x′ of the two points of measurement, i.e., x
and x′, and the midpoint X ≡ (x + x′) /2. The derivative with respect to X,
i.e., ∂Xn , acts on some statistics within the structure function equations. Lo-
cal homogeneity is the approximation that the rate of change of statistics with
respect to the location of measurement may be neglected. Since that location
is X, the result of ∂Xn acting on a statistic is neglected relative to other terms
in the structure function equations. This is a truly local deﬁnition; it makes no
mention of a spatial domain. This deﬁnition of local homogeneity was exploited
in the formulation of exact structure function equations in [2, 14], and has been
used in studies [10, 11, 12, 13] of the eﬀects of inhomogeneity on the balance of
structure function equations; it was introduced in [17].

Local homogeneity has been given various deﬁnitions by diﬀerent au-
thors. Kolmogorov[18] introduced a space-time domain that is small compared
to L and T = (L/U ), where L and U are “typical length and velocity for the
ﬂow in the whole.” Kolmogorov considers the two-point diﬀerences of the veloc-
ities at spatial points in the domain; one point is common to all the diﬀerences.
Kolmogorov[18] deﬁnes local homogeneity as follows: the joint probability dis-
tribution of the velocity diﬀerences is independent of the one common spatial
point, and of the velocity at the one common point, and of time. There are
data [19, 20, 21] that contradict the statistical independence of velocity diﬀer-

3

ence and the velocity at either end point, and also contradict the statistical
independence of velocity diﬀerence and the velocity at the midpoint. The
exception is isotropic turbulence [21], for which case local homogeneity is as-
sured. An alternative possibility that is particularly relevant here is that the
two-point velocity sum, un + u′
n, might be statistically independent of velocity
diﬀerence, but statements in [20, 21] contradict that statistical independence
as well. Therefore, Kolmogorov’s[18] deﬁnition should not be used because
experimental data contradict that statistical independence [19, 20, 22], as do
theoretical considerations [22]. Recently, Frisch et al.[23] have considered the
inconsistency of Kolmogorov’s deﬁnition of local homogeneity.

Monin and Yaglom [24] deﬁne local homogeneity to mean that the joint
probability distribution of the two-spatial-point velocity diﬀerences is unaﬀected
by any translation of the spatial points. They do not impose a restriction on
the translations to a spatial domain.
It follows that statistics composed en-
tirely of the velocity diﬀerences obey the same relationships that they do for
homogeneous turbulence (namely, they are independent of where they are mea-
sured), and that the mean velocity depends linearly on position[24]. In practice,
statistics of velocity diﬀerences and of derivatives do depend on where they are
measured except in the ideal case of homogeneous turbulence. Frisch [25] gives
a deﬁnition that is equivalent to that of Monin and Yaglom [24], except that the
translations are restricted to a domain the size of the spatial scale characteris-
tic of the production of turbulent energy (which he calls the “integral scale”).
Two-point structure function equations of all orders contain a statistic that is
the product of not only factors of the velocity diﬀerence but also one factor
of the sum of the two velocities, i.e., un + u′
n [2, 14]. Because the deﬁnitions
of local homogeneity by Monin and Yaglom [24] and Frisch [25] involve only
the joint probability distribution of two-point diﬀerences, but do not involve
un + u′
n, it follows that those deﬁnitions are not suﬃcient to simplify structure
function equations to the same level of simpliﬁcation as does homogeneity.

3.1 Deﬁnition of two-point, two-time quantities

Here, we extend the results in [2] to two times and to the structure function
composed of the product of acceleration diﬀerence and velocity diﬀerence. Four
independent variables are considered; x and x′ are spatial points; t and t′ are
i = ui(x′, t′), and accelerations by
times. Denote velocities by ui = ui(x, t), u′
i = ai(x′, t′), etc. Quantities that will appear when we use the

Just as (x, x′, t, t′) are independent variables, so are (X, r, T¸ , t¸). The signiﬁ-
cance of variable X is that it is the location of measurement. Nonzero values
of derivatives of statistics with respect to X, evaluated at position X, are the
result of local inhomogeneity of the ﬂow. Likewise, nonzero values of derivatives
of statistics with respect to T¸ are the result of nonstationarity of the ﬂow. The

3.3 The r-sphere and orientation averages

Local isotropy has been used in the past to remove the divergence from
∂rn diin and to proceed to Kolmogorov’s equation. Without the assumption of
local isotropy, an average over an r-sphere removes the divergence from ∂rn diin.
The r-sphere average also mitigates anisotropy[26, 2]. Energy dissipation rate
ε averaged over a sphere in r-space, hεir-sphere, was introduced by Obukhov[27]
and Kolmogorov[28] in 1962; it is a recurrent theme in small-scale similarity
theories. We have produced exact dynamical equations containing the sphere-
averaged energy dissipation rate[2]. The volume average over an r-space sphere
of radius rS of a quantity Q is deﬁned by

3.4 The X-space and X-surface averages

Let the spatial average be over a region R in X-space. The spatial average
of any quantity Q is denoted by hQiR, which has argument list (R, r, T¸ , t¸); that
is,

3.5 Time average

Consider the term ∂T¸ dij in (5). The time average of a quantity Q from an

initial time T¸ 0 and over a duration T is deﬁned by

Q (X, r, T¸ , t¸) dT¸ .

T¸ 0

= [dij (X, r, T¸ 0 + T, t¸) − dij (X, r, T¸ 0, t¸)] /T.

(13)

This shows that it is easy to evaluate h∂T¸ dijiT using experimental data because
only the data at times T¸ 0 and T¸ 0 +T are used. One can make h∂T¸ dij iT as small
as one desires by allowing T to be very large, provided that dij (X, r, T¸ 0 + T, t¸)
does not diﬀer greatly from dij (X, r, T¸ 0, t¸).

4 Theorem of Mann, Ott, and Andersen

Mann et al.[3] and Ott and Mann[4] studied turbulent dispersion of particles
by means of particle tracking. They therefore used an ensemble average over
particle trajectory events. The ensemble average is formed from observations
of many particle-pair trajectories and r values.
It is also possible to use single
trajectories; then two times, t and t′, are needed. From the data, averages are
stored in bins of the direction and length of r. Denote the ensemble average by
hiE. The ensemble average is a sum and therefore commutes with the spatial
and temporal derivatives. Mann et al.[3] assumed local homogeneity. From the
̥iiniE = ∂Xn h̥iiniE = 0,
present deﬁnition of local homogeneity, we have h∂Xn
and similarly hW iE = 0. Consequently, the ensemble average of (6) can be
written as

hAiiiE = ∂T¸ hdiiiE + ∂rn hdiiniE = 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiE − 2 hε + ε′iE .

(14)

For r much larger than dissipation-range scales, Mann et al.[3] neglect the term
2ν∂rn∂rn hdiiiE. Doing so, and using the deﬁnition of Aij , we have

h(ai − a′

i) (ui − u′

i)iE = − hε + ε′iE .

(15)

With two exceptions, this is the result of [3] in their equation (90) First, their
result contains an extraneous derivative moment that is absent above. Second,
hε + ε′iE appears above, whereas 2 hεiE is in their result.
In an experimental
apparatus, there can be a systematic diﬀerence between the energy dissipation
rates at (x, t) versus (x′, t′), even if t = t′, such that hεiE 6= hε′iE.

The above ensemble averages depend on r, which is the vector separation
of points on trajectories from which data are obtained. That dependence on r
allows a further average over the r-sphere. Anisotropy of the ﬂow might favor
the occurrence of some orientations of r; by weighting of the occurrences, the
r-sphere average is constructed for uniform orientation of r.

4.1 Applying the r-sphere average

The r-sphere average causes each point x to coincide with point x′ when

the orientation of r is reversed. Consequently,

hhε + ε′iEir-sphere = 2 hhεiEix-sphere = 2 hhε′iEix′-sphere

8

where averages over spheres in x-space and x′-space are introduced. The par-
ticle tracking experiment is temporally stationary such that ∂T¸ hdiiiE vanishes.
Then, the r-sphere average of (14) gives

hdiiniE = −

rS hhεiEix-sphere ,

Irn

4
3

which is an extension of the 4/3 law without use of local isotropy, and

hh(ai − a′

i) (ui − u′

i)iEir-sphere = −2 hhεiEix-sphere .

(16)

Mann et al.[3] give (16), except that their result contains an extraneous deriva-
tive moment. See equation (91) in [3].

4.2 Quantifying eﬀects of inhomogeneity

The terms that are neglected on the basis of local homogeneity, such as
∂Xn h̥iiniE, can be measured by particle tracking. To evaluate the eﬀects of
inhomogeneity, the rate of change with respect to displacement of the averaging
volume is needed, i.e., X must be changed. The most troublesome of the terms
describing inhomogeneity is the term −2∂Xi [(p − p′) (ui − u′
i)] in (7) because
it requires a measurement of pressure diﬀerence. By applying the derivative
relationship (2), the r-sphere average (8), and the divergence theorem (10), the
most troublesome term can be expressed as

∂Xi hh(p − p′) (ui − u′

i)iEir-sphere =

h(p + p′) (un − u′

n)iE .

rS Irn

The right-hand side requires the two-point pressure sum correlated with the
velocity diﬀerence and an average over orientations of r as deﬁned in(9).

The spatial average of (6) and use of the divergence theorem (11) gives

hAiiiR = ∂T¸ hdiiiR +

These averages are for any arbitrary region R.

There are several possibilities for eliminating the terms S

ligible in the case of local homogeneity, which case requires a suﬃciently large

Reynolds number and small |r|. Second, as in [2], those terms vanish for the
case of periodic boundary conditions, such as are often used in DNS, provided
that the spatial average is over the entire spatial period. Third, those terms
vanish if the turbulence is of limited spatial extent and the volume average is
over a much larger region such that the velocity and pressure ﬁelds are negligible
on the surface that bounds R; this possibility causes the statistics to decrease
as V increases. Fourth, if the region R is enclosed by rigid boundaries with the
no-slip boundary condition on velocities, then only the pressure gradient term
at far right in (18) is nonzero at points on the boundaries; a separate hypoth-
∂Xn (p + p′) vanishes is required. Nie and Tanveer[5] eliminate
esis that
the subject terms by integrating over the “entire volume”; the meaning must
be of an inﬁnite volume unless boundary conditions are speciﬁed. Neglecting
the subject terms, we have

Xn
H

hAiiiR = ∂T¸ hdiiiR + ∂rn hdiiniR = 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiR − 2 hε + ε′iR .

(19)

For r much larger than dissipation-range scales, neglect the term 2ν∂rn∂rn hdiiiR.
For an average over the entire ﬂow and for t = t′,

hε + ε′iR = 2 hεiR = 2 hε′iR .

If t 6= t′, then clearly, hεiR 6= hε′iR. The deﬁnition of Aij and (19) give

h(ai − a′

i) (ui − u′

i)iR = −2 hεiR .

(20)

Apply the time average (12) to (19). Nie and Tanveer[5] take the
averaging time, T , to be inﬁnite such that (13) vanishes. Alternatively, one can
assume suﬃcient stationarity that the trace of (13) is negligible. Also apply
the r-sphere average (8). Then (19) gives, for t = t′,

Note that the orientation average of diin, as deﬁned in (9), appears in (21) as
a consequence of the divergence theorem (10). This is a theorem of Nie and
Tanveer[5]. Their order of averaging is diﬀerent, namely R then
then T ,
but the averages commute as discussed in Sec. 3.6.

6 Theorem of Duchon and Robert

The important distinction between the theorem of Nie and Tanveer (dis-
cussed above) and that of Duchon and Robert[6] is that the space-time averaging
required by Duchon and Robert is of arbitrary extent and the viscosity is zero.
In this case, the averaging region R is a subdomain of the entire ﬂow. Recall

Take the averaging region R to have a simple topology such that the volume
to surface ratio V /S is the size of R.
Because ν = 0 is eﬀectively the limit
of inﬁnite Reynolds number, rS can be as small as desired. Therefore, the
limit SrS/V → 0 can now be applied. This limit means that rS is very small
compared to the size of the averaging volume V /S, but there is no requirement
that V /S be a length scale at which energy is generated. Thus, the size of the
averaging volume is arbitrary provided that V /S ≫ rS. The limit SrS/V → 0
applied to (23) gives

which is seen to vanish in the limit SrS/V → 0. The reason for not eliminating
this advective term from (24) in the previous step is to make a point about
random sweeping at the end of this section.

The theorem of Duchon and Robert[6] applies to the case t = t′. In the
previous section where the average was over the entire ﬂow we had hεiR = hε′iR
if t = t′. That is not true here because R is now a subdomain of the entire ﬂow;
as X varies over R with r ﬁxed, not every spatial point occupied by x coincides
with a spatial point occupied by x′ and vice versa. However, including the
r-sphere average does cause x and x′ to equally occupy every spatial point
in the double integration. That is, for t = t′, hhεiRir-sphere = hhε′iRir-sphere.
Henceforth, consider only the case t = t′. Thus,

ε + ε′

(cid:28)(cid:28)

= hhεiRir-sphere = hhε′iRir-sphere .

Apply the r-sphere average (8) and the divergence theorem (10), and neglect
the advective term in (25), and apply the time average, then (24) gives

If hhdiiiRir-sphere decreases as rS decreases, then there is an averaging duration
T suﬃciently large that the left-most term in (26) may be neglected. The
classic inertial-range case serves as an example; namely, hhdiiiRir-sphere scales
with ǫ2/3r2/3
S , where, for brevity, ǫ ≡ hhεiRir-sphere. For that case, the ratio of
the right-hand side of (27) to the right-hand side of (26) is not greater than
order ǫ−1/3r2/3
S /T . That is, to neglect the time-derivative term the averaging
duration T must be much greater than the inertial-range time scale ǫ−1/3r2/3
S .
Recall that ν = 0 such that rS, and also ǫ−1/3r2/3
S , may be as small as desired.
Hence T may be much smaller than integral time scales.

Thus, with ν = 0 and a space average of arbitrary length scale, provided
that length scale is much greater than rS, and a time average of arbitrary
duration, provided that duration is much greater than the inertial-range time
scale based on rS, we have

This is closely related to the theorem of Duchon and Robert[6]. The order of
the averaging operations in (28) is the same as in [6], although those averaging
operations commute (see Sec. 3.6). Note that the orientation average, as
deﬁned in (9), appears in (28) as a consequence of the divergence theorem (10).

6.1 Random sweeping

Eyink[7] inquires into the feasibility of numerical and experimental tests
of his theorems and the theorem of Duchon and Robert. An aspect of such
testing is the fact that the sum of the time derivative and advective terms in
(24) can be much smaller than either term taken separately. The time derivative
and advective terms in (24) constitute a comoving derivative. For simplicity,
remove the factor rS/3 and the r-sphere average from these two terms; then
their sum can be written as

∂T¸ hdiiiR + hh˘uniR ∂Xn diiiR = ∂T¸ hdiiiR + h˘uniR h∂Xn diiiR

= ∂T¸ hdiiiR +

wherein two of many ways to express the sum are given. The last expression
contains the product of the scalar dii and the outward normal unit vector
Nn
averaged over the surface of the averaging volume followed by the inner product
b
with h˘uniR. Recall that ˘un ≡ (un + u′
n) /2; thus h˘uniR constitutes the sweeping
velocity of the scales larger than the averaging volume as well as any mean ﬂow
advection. The eﬀect of changes of the advective term is a corresponding change
of the time derivative ∂T¸ hdiiiR such that the sum of the two terms can be much
smaller than either taken separately.

6.2 Acceleration-velocity structure function

The relationship of the acceleration-velocity structure function to the en-
ergy dissipation rate is given in (15) and (16) on the basis of the ensemble
average without and with the r-sphere average, respectively, and in (20) on the
basis of an average over the entire ﬂow. Now, (24) contains

h(ai − a′

i) (ui − u′

i)iR = − hε + ε′iR .

(29)

This is obtained on the basis of ν = 0 and the local space average without
the time and r-sphere averages and without requiring t = t′. Terms describing
random and mean-ﬂow sweeping are absent from the derivation of (29).

7 Eﬀect of large-scale inhomogeneities at small

scales

Recent research has quantiﬁed the inﬂuence of inhomogeneous terms on
the balance of structure function equations. Those studies have applied to
channel ﬂow[10, 11, 12], wind tunnel grid-generated turbulence[8, 9, 11, 12],
and turbulent jets[13]. The Reynolds decomposition of all terms in the exact
equation (5) is given in [29]. That decomposition contains all possible terms
contributing to the eﬀects of inhomogeneous large-scale structures. For the
ensemble average, the Reynolds decomposition of ui(x, t) is deﬁned by

ui(x, t) ≡ Ui(x, t) +

ui(x, t), Ui(x, t) ≡ hui(x, t)iE , h

ui(x, t)iE = 0,

and similarly at the point x′. Consider the Reynolds decomposition of the
average of the term ∂Xn Fijn in (5)

Note that Dij is the structure function of velocity, not of velocity ﬂuctuations.
For grid-generated turbulence data, one can let subscript 1 denote the down-
stream direction and approximate U1 = U ′
1, such that the ﬁrst term on the
right-hand side of (30) is U1∂X1 Dij; this is the form of the inhomogeneous term
derived in the above-mentioned studies.[8, 9, 11, 12] One can easily show that
the second term on the right-hand side of (30) is a generalization of the in-
homogeneous term given in [10, 11] for the case of uniform channel ﬂow. Of
course, (30) and the other Reynolds decompositions given in [29] are exact for
every ﬂow, whether laminar or turbulent. Equations for structure functions
of velocity ﬂuctuations diﬀer signiﬁcantly from equations for the velocity; that
topic has been treated in detail in [29].

The exact structure functions are useful in other respects. For example,
from (3) and (4) it is clear that the pressure velocity term vanishes from the
trace equations such as (14) and (17) on the basis of incompressibility and local
homogeneity.
It is not necessary to assume the more restrictive basis of local
isotropy as in [13]. The combination of (5) and (30) shows that both ∂T¸ Dij
and 1
n) ∂Xn Dij must appear in the structure function equation as was
correctly deduced by Lindborg [8] on the basis of mean-ﬂow Galilean invariance,
but replacing ∂T¸ Dij with 1
n) ∂Xn Dij, as was done in early derivations
on the basis of Taylor’s hypothesis, does not preserve that invariance.

8 Summary

The formulation of the exact statistical equations in the variables X and r
of (1) produces the pragmatic deﬁnition of local homogeneity discussed in Sec.
2.
It is the single deﬁnition that simpliﬁes structure function equations for
the case of local homogeneity. The analogous deﬁnition of local stationarity
arises from use of the temporal variables T¸ and t¸ of (1). The resultant or-
ganization of the exact statistical equations provides immediate and improved
derivation of the inertial-range relationships (14)–(16) between the acceleration-
velocity structure function, the third-order velocity structure function, and the
energy dissipation rate. Further, all terms that must be evaluated to include
the eﬀects of turbulence inhomogeneity and anisotropy are evident in the for-
mulation. That makes the exact statistical equation method useful to particle
tracking experiments such as the turbulence acceleration experiments at Cornell
University. The recent theorems of Nie and Tanveer [5] in (21) and of Duchon
and Robert [6] in (28) are likewise obtained easily, as are their generalizations,
e.g., (17). The relationship between the acceleration-velocity structure func-
tion and energy dissipation rate is obtained in (29) on the basis of only a local
spatial average for ν = 0. With (30) as one example of the Reynolds decom-
position of all terms in the exact statistical equations in [29], it is evident that
the exact statistical equation formulation eﬃciently reveals all terms that must
be evaluated to quantify the inﬂuence of inhomogeneity on the balance of struc-
ture function equations.
It is not necessary to derive the individual terms that
describe the eﬀects of inhomogeneity that are missing from equations valid only

14

for homogeneous turbulence. All such terms are now known.

The above are examples of the use of exact statistical equations. Their

usefulness arises from the organization of the equations.

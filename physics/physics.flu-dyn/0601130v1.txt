Abstract

We consider a shear ﬂow of a scale invariant homogeneous Gaussian
random velocity ﬁeld which does not depend on the coordinates in the
direction of the ﬂow. We investigate a heat advection coming from a
Gaussian random homogeneous source. We discuss a relaxation at large
time of a temperature distribution determined by the forced advection-
diﬀusion equation. We represent the temperature correlation functions
by means of the Feynman-Kac formula. Jensen inequalities are applied
for lower and upper bounds on the correlation functions. We show that
at ﬁnite time there is no velocity dependence of long range temperature
correlations (low momentum asymptotics) in the direction of the ﬂow
but the equilibrium heat distribution has large distance correlations (low
momentum behaviour) with an index depending on the scaling index of
the random ﬂow and of the index of the random forcing. If the velocity
has correlations growing with the distance ( a turbulent ﬂow) then the
large distance correlations depend in a crucial way on the scaling index of
the turbulent ﬂow. In such a case the correlations increase in the direction
of the ﬂow and decrease in the direction perpendicular to the ﬂow making
the stream of heat more coherent.

Introduction

We investigate a heat advection in a random ﬂow which is supposed to be ”tur-
bulent”. The turbulence is a complex phenomenon diﬃcult to deﬁne and avoid-
ing a description in precise mathematical terms. The complexity of turbulence
can be related to its dependence on the length scale relevant for undergoing
experiments. In this paper we apply only some aspects of the turbulent ﬂow
randomness of the velocity ﬁeld, its self-similarity and long range correlations .
The appearance of the turbulence should have an impact on transport phenom-
ena described by an advection-diﬀusion equation of a passive scalar [1]. Such an

1

equation can describe a transport of heat, a mass or some impurities. We are
interested in the equilibrium distribution of solutions of the random advection-
diﬀusion equation . The equilibrium is possible only under an external forcing
(a heat source). We are interested in the equilibrium distribution at all scales.
Such an equilibrium will depend on the forcing. The universality is possible
only in the inertial range [2][3] [4] where the external forcing should not be rel-
evant(see ref.[5] for some recent shear ﬂow experiments) . Although the precise
equilibrium distribution depends on the form of the forcing the asymptotic be-
haviour of correlation functions depends solely on the asymptotic behaviour of
the random forcing. We investigate the way the long range correlations of the
ﬂuid velocity inﬂuence the long range correlations of the temperature.

RD with x

We assume that there is a distinguished direction of the ﬂuid velocity V.
RD−d ;
We make a decomposition X = (x, z)
Rd and has the non-vanishing components only in
V(τ, x) depends only on x
RD−d (in such a case it satisﬁes automatically
V = 0;for physical applications
D = 3 and d = 2 or d = 1). As a typical example we could consider a ﬂuid
ﬂow Vz(x, y) in the direction of the z-axis which does not depend on z. We can
impose such an anisotropy of the ﬂow by an external force R which depends
only on x and has non-zero components solely in the z direction. So, we consider
the Navier-Stokes equation with such a random force R

In secs.2-3 we discuss the advection-diﬀusion equation, the random veloc-
ity and a random forcing. The advection-diﬀusion equation can be solved by
means of the Feynman-Kac formula. The Feynman-Kac solution has already
been discussed by other authors [6]-[7]. These authors have been interested in
the asymptotic behaviour of the advection-diﬀusion equation without forcing.
Our main interest (secs.4-5) is in the asymptotic behaviour for large time and
distances of correlation functions of the temperature ﬁeld resulting from the
advection-diﬀusion equation with forcing describing the heat injection. First, in
sec.3 we simulate forcing by a constant gradient term in the temperature. We
obtain a simple soluble model of advection illustrating some general features.
In general, we can obtain some lower and upper bounds on the correlation func-
tions by means of the Jensen inequalities (sec.5). For the sake of simplicity we
concentrate on the two-point correlations. In sec.6 we show how our methods
can be extended to multi-point correlations. We compare our methods and
results (in secs.4-6 and in the Appendix B) with an exactly soluble model of

2

Kraichnan [8][4][9]. The random advection is closely connected with a diﬀusion.
In fact, under some natural assumptions random advection enforces diﬀusion
[10][11][12] and vice versa the diﬀusion can be expressed as a white noise advec-
tion [13]. However, when we choose no diﬀusion (zero molecular diﬀusivity) in
the initial equation of advection describing the temperature evolution then we
obtain a model of advection (discussed in Appendix A) as a limit of the solution
of the random advection-diﬀusion equation.

In the text some positive constants arise (denoted usually as K,c1, etc.)

which are not described at each case and are not related one to another.

We consider the advection in a random velocity ﬁeld V ( described in the In-
troduction) forced by a random source f

the singularity of the velocity’s covariance is of the form δ(t
there are two standard interpretations either Ito or Stratonovitch [14] [15]. The
diﬀerence between them in eq.(1)is 1

First, let us consider V = 0 and f = 0. Let N be a (deterministic) solution

of the heat equation

We expand θ around the solution N of the diﬀusion equation

(if the mean value of V is zero then T describes ﬂuctuations of the temperature).

heat equation between two planes kept at ﬁxed temperatures. For such a static
solution

F = f + Vg

We can see that even if f = 0 then F is non-trivial. This is a frequent realization
of an advection in experiments [18][19]. In such a case the source F has the
same distribution as the velocity. A constant mean gradient is distinguishing
a direction in space. It breaks the rotational symmetry. As a model we could
consider g = (0, 0, gz) and V = (0, 0, Vz).

We deﬁne the spectral measure ρ of the temperature T which is directly

this reason we may set T0 = 0 from the beginning. The stationary solutions
N being harmonic functions are not square integrable in RD. Admitting such
functions as initial conditions we could regain the solution N from eq.(13) (with
F = 0 ). In particular, the mean gradient (4) comes from a generalized function
˜T0 with its support concentrated at p = 0.

Before discussing more general correlations let us consider the constant mean
gradient (eqs.(4)-(5)) with f = 0 and F = gV. Then, from eq.(13) (with T0 = 0)

simple consequences for the heat transport. It may be not exact in mathematical
models. As an example, for the shear ﬂow solution of the Navier-Stokes equation
discussed in the Introduction if Cjl(ω, k) is the spectral function of the force
distribution R then the spectral function of the stationary velocity distribution
(obtained as a solution of the Navier-Stokes equation with the initial condition

Till now we have kept the mean velocity U as an arbitrary non zero function.We
can obtain a lower bound only if

U = 0

As claimed by some authors (see ,e.g.,the standard text-book [23]) the mean
velocity does not play any essential role in turbulence. So, setting it equal to
zero we do not lose much. Moreover, for the lower bound we must assume m
of the form (24) (or (25)) with ˜m0(p)
0. Then, we can apply the Jensen
inequality to the expectation value over the Brownian motion

and the additional integral in eq.(64) is over the spatial variable u.

We can repeat the basic estimates concerning the behaviour for low z mo-
menta and large x distances by means of the methods applied for the two-point
correlations. First, by means of the Jensen inequalities we reduce the estimates
of the expectation values to ﬁnite dimensional integrals. From the Jensen in-
equalities we can see that the correlation functions are bounded in τ when
τ
. Next, the results concerning the scaling behaviour for 2n-point func-
tions can be obtained by an introduction of spherical coordinates in the dt1...dtn
integral in eq.(63). Then, the correlation functions scale in a simple way with
respect to the temporal radius r. Let us explain such estimates in more detail
for n = 2. Then,

In such a case r scales in the exponential in the same way as in

Note that the power describing the low p behaviour in eq.(66) is twice as big
as that for the two-point function (34) and (40) indicating the asymptotic scale
invariance of the temperature ˜T∞(x, p) at low momenta (large distances). This
property can be extended to the 2n correlation functions where the scaling index
is proportional to n as a consequence of the drrn−1 time integral in the spherical
time coordinates. Such a behaviour of the integrals allows us to conclude that if
the velocities and the sources are scale invariant then the temperatures scale at
large distances with the scale dimension determined by the two-point function.

Tτ is the Gaussian ﬁeld. The 2n correlation functions are sums of n products of
2-point correlation functions. Hence, if 2-point correlation functions are scale
invariant then the same remains true for 2n correlation functions. Let us note

for a pure diﬀusion and for an advection by a uniformly bounded random ﬂow.
We can see from eqs.(40),(42),(44),(59) and (61) that the turbulent behaviour
γ =
β < 0 of the velocity ﬁeld will (in comparison to zero velocity and regular
velocity) decrease the temperature correlations in the direction orthogonal to
the ﬂow and increase the correlations (at the ﬁxed α)in the direction of the ﬂow.
These eﬀects contribute to the more coherent heat distribution in a turbulent
stream.

If there is no diﬀusion (µ = 0) then our formulas in secs.4-6 at ﬁnite τ remain
valid but need some interpretation. There is no expectation value over the
Brownian motion. In such a case in some formulas (as in eqs.(34)-(35)) γ = 0.

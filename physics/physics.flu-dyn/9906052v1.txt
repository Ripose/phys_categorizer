We investigate the stabilization mechanisms due to viscous forces of the invasion front in drainage
displacement in two dimensional porous media using a network simulator. We ﬁnd that in horizontal
displacement the capillary pressure diﬀerence between two diﬀerent points along the front vary
linearly as function of height separation in the direction of the displacement. We conclude that
existing theory from percolation fails to describe our simulation results. We have also compared
our results with some experimental data and ﬁnd that the width of the front scales similar to
gravitational stabilization.

Immiscible displacement of one ﬂuid by another ﬂuid
in porous media generates front structures and patterns
ranging from compact to ramiﬁed and fractal [1,2,3,4].
When a nonwetting ﬂuid displaces a wetting ﬂuid
(drainage) at low injection rate, the nonwetting ﬂuid
generates a pattern of fractal dimension similar to the
cluster formed by invasion percolation [5,6,7,8]. The dis-
placement is controlled solely by the capillary pressure
Pc, that is the pressure diﬀerence between the two ﬂuids
across a pore meniscus. At high injection rate and when
the viscosity of the nonwetting ﬂuid is higher or equal to
the viscosity of the wetting ﬂuid, the width of the dis-
placement front stabilizes and a more compact pattern is
generated [3,9]

When the displacement is oriented out of the horizon-
tal plane, gravity may stabilize the front width due to
density diﬀerences between the ﬂuids [10,11]. The pro-
cess has been linked to invasion percolation with a stabi-
lizing gradient [10,11,12], and the saturated front width
ws, is found to depend on the strength of the gravity like
−ν/(1+ν). Here Bo = ∆ρga2/γ is the bond num-
ws ∝ Bo
ber indicating the ratio of gravity to capillary forces and
ν is the correlation length exponent from percolation the-
ory. Moreover, ∆ρ denotes the density diﬀerences of the
ﬂuids, g is the acceleration due to gravity, a is the typical
pore size, and γ denotes the ﬂuid interface tension.

Wilkinson [10] used percolation theory to deduce a
power law between ws and the capillary number Ca,
when only viscous forces stabilize the front (horizontal
−ν/(1+t−β+ν), where

notes the injection rate, Σ is the cross section of the inlet
and µnw denotes the viscosity of the nonwetting phase.
Later on, Xu et al. [13] used Wilkinson’s arguments to
show that the pressure drop across a height diﬀerence

∆h in the nonwetting phase along the front should scale
as ∆Pnw ∝ ∆ht/ν+de−1−β/ν. Here de is the Euclidean
dimension of the space embedded by the front. In two
dimension their result yields ∆Pnw ∝ ∆h1.9. Moreover,
they argued that the corresponding pressure drop in the
wetting phase ∆Pw, must be linearly dependent on ∆h
according to the compact displaced ﬂuid (see Fig. 1).

The purpose of the present letter is to investigate the
stabilization mechanisms of the front due to viscous and
capillary forces. We consider two-dimensional horizontal
drainage, thus neglecting the gravity force. We present
simulations where we have calculated the capillary pres-
sure diﬀerence ∆Pc, between two diﬀerent pore menisci
along the front separated a height ∆h in the direction
of the displacement. The simulations are based on a
network model that properly describe the dynamics of
the ﬂuid-ﬂuid displacement as well as the capillary and
viscous pressure buildup. Simulations show that for a
wide range of injection rates and diﬀerent ﬂuid viscosities
∆Pc varies linearly with ∆h (Figs. 2 and 3). Assuming a
power law behavior ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ our best estimate of the
exponent is κ = 1.0±0.1. This is a surprisingly simple re-
sult and not expected because the viscous force ﬁeld are
non homogeneous, due to the trapping of ﬂuid behind
the front and the fractal behavior of the front structure.
According to Xu et al. [13] ∆Pc = ∆Pnw − ∆Pw
(Fig. 1). At low injection rate or when the viscosity of
the nonwetting ﬂuid is much higher than the viscosity of
the wetting one, we may neglect the pressure drop in the
wetting ﬂuid giving ∆Pc ∼ ∆Pnw ∝ ∆h1.9. Hence, the
argument of Xu et al. is in conﬂict with our result which
we ﬁnd to be similar to gravitational stabilization where
∆Pc = ∆ρg∆h ∝ ∆h [10,11]. We have also computed
the saturated front width ws, and compared our results
to experiments performed by Frette et al. [9]. We show
that since ∆Pc behaves as if gravity stabilizes the front
we may substitute Bo with Ca, giving that ws should
−ν/(1+ν). Experimental work
scale with Ca like ws ∝ Ca

of Frette et al. [9] conﬁrm this results (Fig. 4).

The model porous medium consists of a square lattice
of cylindrical tubes oriented at 45◦. Four tubes meet at
each node in the lattice, and the tubes represent the vol-
ume of both pores and throats. The tubes have equal
length d, and their radii r is chosen at random inside an
interval (see below) introducing the disorder in the sys-
tem. The tube network is initially ﬁlled with a wetting
ﬂuid of viscosity µw and a nonwetting ﬂuid of viscosity
µnw ≥ µw is injected at the bottom row (inlet). The vis-
cosity ratio M , is deﬁned as M ≡ µnw/µw. The wetting
ﬂuid is displaced and ﬂows out along the top row (outlet).
There are periodic boundary condition in the horizontal
direction. The ﬂuids are assumed immiscible, hence an
interface (a meniscus) is generated where the ﬂuids meet
in the tubes. The capillary pressure pc, of the menisci is
chosen to pc = (2γ/r) [1 − cos(2πx/d)]. The ﬁrst term is
Young-Laplace law for cylindrical tube when perfect wet-
ting is assumed and in the second term x is the position
of the meniscus in the tube, i.e. 0 ≤ x ≤ d. Thus, with
respect to the capillary pressure we treat the tubes as
if they were hourglass shaped with eﬀective radii follow-
ing a smooth function. By letting pc vary as above we
include the eﬀect of local readjustments of the menisci
at pore level [14] which is important for the description
of burst dynamics [15,16]. This detailed modeling of the
capillary pressure costs computation time. However, it
is necessary in order to properly simulate the capillary
pressure behavior along the front.

The volume ﬂux qij through a tube between the ith

and the jth node is given by Washburn equation [17],

qij = −(σij kij /µij)(pj − pi − pc,ij)/d .

(1)

Here kij is the permeability of the tube (r2
cross section (πr2

ij /8), σij is the
ij ) of the tube, pi and pj is the nodal

2

pressures at node i and j respectively, and pc,ij is the
sum of the capillary pressures of the menisci inside the
tube. A tube partially ﬁlled with both liquids, is allowed
to contain either one or two menisci. Furthermore, µij
denotes the eﬀective viscosity given by the sum of the
volume fractions of each ﬂuid inside the tube multiplied
by their respective viscosities. At each node we have
conservation of volume ﬂux giving

Pj qij = 0 ,

(2)

so that Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) constitute a set of linear equa-
tions which are to be solved for the nodal pressures pj.
The set of equations is solved by using the Conjugate
Gradient method [18] with the constraint that the injec-
tion rate Q is held constant. See Refs. [14] and [19] for
further details of how pj is found.

Given the solution of pj we calculate the volume ﬂux
qij through each tube ij and deﬁne a time step ∆t, such
that every meniscus is allowed to travel at most a max-
imum step length ∆xmax, during that time step. The
menisci are moved a distance (qij /σij )∆t and menisci
that are moved out of a tube are spread into neighbor
tubes [14,19]. Numerical simulations show that to cal-
culate the variations in the capillary pressure as menisci
travel through tubes, we must choose ∆xmax ≤ 0.1d.

Due to the computational eﬀort, the lattice sizes used
in the simulations are limited to 25 × 35 and 40 × 60
nodes. To study the behavior of ∆Pc on larger lattices,
we have generated invasion percolation (IP) clusters with
a stabilizing gradient on lattices of 200 × 300 nodes. The
IP clusters are assumed to be statistical equal with same
fractal dimension [9], to corresponding structures that
would have been obtain in a complete displacement pro-
cess. Thus, to save computation time, the generated IP
clusters were loaded into our network model, and the
displacement simulations were run a few number of time
steps from this point.

The front between the invading and the defending
ﬂuid is detected by running a Hoshen-Kopelman algo-
rithm [20] on the lattice. The front width w is deﬁned
as the standard deviation of the distances between each
meniscus along the front and the average front position.
∆Pc is approximatively deﬁned in Fig. 1. However, in
the simulations ∆Pc is equal to the mean of the cap-
illary pressure diﬀerences between all pairs of menisci
separated a vertical distance ∆h along the front. The
capillary pressure diﬀerence between a pair of menisci is
always calculated by taking the capillary pressure of the
meniscus closest to the inlet minus the capillary pressure
of the meniscus closest to the outlet.

The simulations on the 25 × 35 nodes lattice were per-
formed with µnw = 10 P, µw = 0.10 P (i.e. M = 100) and
γ = 30 dyn/cm at six diﬀerent Ca between 1.1×10−2 and
3.7×10−4 by varying the injection rate. At each Ca we
did 30 simulations with diﬀerent sets of random radii in

the interval 0.05d ≤ rij ≤ d and tube length d = 0.1 cm.
∆Pc was recorded and the result for some Ca is shown in
Fig. 2. We observe that ∆Pc increases roughly linearly
as function of ∆h. At lowest Ca the front was found to
stabilize due to the ﬁnite size of the system. At higher
Ca the viscous gradient stabilizes the front. The gradient
causes the capillary pressure of the menisci closest to the
inlet to exceed the capillary pressure of the menisci lying
in the uppermost part. Thus, the menisci closest to the
inlet will more easily penetrate a narrow tube compared
to menisci further down the stream. This will eventually
stabilize the front.

The IP clusters were generated on the bonds in a
square lattice with the bonds oriented at 45◦. Hence,
the bonds correspond to the tubes in our network model.
Each bond ij were assign a random number fij in the
interval [0, 1]. A stabilizing gradient G = 0.05, was ap-
plied giving an occupation threshold tij of every bond,
tij = fij + Ghij [10,11]. Here hij denotes the height of
bond ij above the bottom row. The occupation of bonds
started at the bottom row, and the next bond to be occu-
pied was always the bond with the lowest threshold value
from the set of empty bonds along the invasion front.
When the invasion front became well developed with clus-
ters of sizes between the bond length and the front width,
the IP clusters where loaded into our network model. The
radii rij of the tubes were mapped to the random num-
bers fij of the bonds as rij = [0.05 + 0.95(1 − fij)]d.
Thus, 0.05d ≤ rij ≤ d and as above we set the tube
length d = 0.1 cm. We map rij to 1 − fij because in IP
the next bond to be invaded is the one with the lowest
threshold value, opposite to the network model, where
the widest tube will be invaded ﬁrst.

Four IP clusters were generated on diﬀerent sets of
fij and loaded into our network model. An injection
rate Q was chosen in correspondence to G and the sim-

ulations were run a limited number of time steps. The
number of time steps where chosen suﬃciently large to
let the menisci along the front adjust according to the
viscous pressure set up by the injection rate. The result
of the calculated ∆Pc versus ∆h is shown in Fig. 3. If
we assume the power law behavior ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ we ﬁnd
κ = 1.0 ± 0.1. The slope of the straight line in Fig. 3 is
1.0. The result in Fig. 1 corresponds to simulations with
M = 100, and we obtained similar result with M = 1.0
(viscosity matched ﬂuids).

Frette et al. [9] performed two phase drainage displace-
ment experiments in a two dimensional porous medium
with viscosity matched ﬂuids, M = 1.0. They reported
on the stabilization of the front and measured the satu-
rated front width ws as function of capillary number. We
have run drainage simulations with similar ﬂuid viscosi-
ties, interface tension and pore sizes as in [9]. The lattice
size was 40 × 60 nodes and the length of the tubes where
chosen at random in the interval 0.02 cm ≤ d ≤ 0.18 cm.
The radii of the tubes were given by the aspect ratio
d/2r = 1.25. Thus, we are eﬀectively dealing with a
distorted square lattice of tubes.

The simulations were run at diﬀerent Ca by varying
the injection rate, and the calculated ws together with
the experimental result in [9] is shown in Fig. 4 as func-

found experimentally, indicated by the solid line in Fig. 4,
and in two dimensions Wilkinson’s argument [10] gives
α = ν/(1+t−β+ν) ≈ 0.38. The Wilkinson argument lies
within the uncertainties of our simulation result. How-
ever, in Fig. 4 there seems to be a crossover in the scal-

ing behavior. For Ca >∼ 1.0×10−5 the simulations ﬁts
α = 0.3 which also seems to be consistent with the exper-
iments despite the few experimental data points in this
regime. For Ca <∼ 1.0×10−5 the experiments match α =
0.6. The crossover lead to the following considerations.
The injection rate Q sets the strength of the viscous pres-
sure gradient resulting in the capillary pressure diﬀer-
ence ∆Pc. Thus, it is reasonable that ∆Pc ∝ Ca∆hκ
where our simulations show that κ = 1.0 ± 0.1. When
gravity stabilizes the front the analog to this relation
is ∆Pc ∝ Bo∆h. Hence, ∆Pc is linearly dependent on
∆h for both viscous and gravitational stabilization. At
suﬃciently low injection rate where the displacement is
close to capillary equilibrium, percolation concepts yields
∆Pc ∝ f − fc ∝ ξ−1/ν [12,10,11]. Here f is the occupa-
tion probability of the bonds, fc is the percolation thresh-
old, and ξ is the correlation length. In the simulations
the correlation length corresponds to the front width,
−ν/(1+ν). Inserting
and therefore we obtain ξ ∝ ws ∝ Ca
−0.57, which is close to the exper-
ν = 4/3 gives ws ∝ Ca
imental result of Frette et al. [9] when Ca <∼ 1.0×10−5
(Fig. 4). At higher Ca >∼ 1.0×10−4 the displacement is
no longer in capillary equilibrium and percolation con-
cepts cannot be applied. Thus, we expect as observed in
Fig. 4, another type of scaling behavior there. At lower
Ca ≃ 1.0×10−5 the width of the front in our simula-
tions becomes bounded by the lattice size and a further
reduction in Ca does not give rise to wider front. There-
fore with our simulations, we don’t expect to observe the
−0.57 regime. Note, however, that the power law
ws ∝ Ca
∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ, where κ = 1.0 is found to be valid for both
low and high capillary numbers.

In summary we conclude that ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ where our
simulations gives κ = 1.0 ± 0.1. We have shown that this
−ν/(1+ν) which is close
lead to the power law ws ∝ Ca

to experimental data in [9]. Our result does not conﬁrm
the Wilkinson’s argument [10] nor the proposed theory
of Xu et al. [13]. We believe the mixing of the dynamic
exponent t and the geometric exponents β and ν like in
Refs. [10,13], should be done with precaution. Experi-
ence with the random resistor network at the percolation
threshold [21,22], shows that diﬀerent dynamic exponents
may be related in an extremely complex way. Attempts
to derive them by simple arguments that combine dy-
namic and geometric exponents, fail. This is probably
due to the multi-fractal structure of the current distribu-
tion. Presumably, this is also the case here, and for that
reason the mixing of dynamic and geometric exponents
fails to describe our simulation results.

The eﬀects of elasticity on ﬁlament thinning and breakup are investigated in microchannel cross
ﬂow. When a viscous solution is stretched by an external immiscible ﬂuid, a low 100 ppm poly-
mer concentration strongly aﬀects the breakup process, compared to the Newtonian case. At late
times when viscoelastic stresses become important, polymer ﬁlaments show much slower evolution,
morphology featuring multiple connected drops, and diﬀerent scaling with the ratio of ﬂow rates.
The ﬁlament thinning process can be described in terms of extensional viscosities of the immiscible
ﬂuids, which for the polymer solution includes strain hardening.

The progressive breakup of an initially stable ﬂuid
thread into small drops or bubbles is a rich phenomenon
of great interest [1]. For example, ﬂow focussing in mi-
croﬂuidic devices can continuously produce drops or bub-
bles whose sizes are controlled by the relative ﬂow rate
of the two immiscible ﬂuids [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. While
most such work concerns Newtonian ﬂuids, many ﬂu-
ids of interest for lab-on-a-chip applications are likely
to exhibit complex micro-structure and non-Newtonian
behavior, such as viscoelasticity. Furthermore, viscoelas-
tic eﬀects scale inversely with the square of the device
length scale, and hence are likely to be accentuated in mi-
croﬂuidic devices. For polymeric drop breakup in macro-
scopic ﬂow, elasticity can give rise to breakup behavior
that is markedly diﬀerent from that of Newtonian ﬂu-
ids [8, 9, 10, 11]. For example, a viscoelastic ﬁlament
driven by gravity in a quiescent bath [12] undergoes an
initial linear viscous decrease in the ﬁlament diameter,
followed by a slower thinning process in which capillary
forces are balanced by the ﬂuid elastic stresses.

Recently, a numerical investigation in a ﬂow-focusing
device [13] showed qualitative diﬀerences with respect
to Newtonian ﬂuids such as prolonged thinning of the
ﬂuid ﬁlament and delay of drop pinch-oﬀ. No measure-
ments of thinning rates or breakup times were presented.
An experimental investigation in a ‘T’ shaped geometry
using a low viscosity, elastic ﬂuid [14] also found pro-
longed thinning of the ﬂuid ﬁlament. The authors ob-
served a linear decrease in ﬁlament diameter followed by
a ‘self-thinning’ exponential regime, which was argued to
have a rate inversely proportional to the ﬂuid relaxation
time (λ). However, λ was found to vary over an order
of magnitude with shear rate, though it should remain
constant; the authors associated this discrepancy with
‘pre-shearing’ eﬀects. While both investigations found
similar qualitative trends, no quantitative connection has
yet been made to the extensional ﬂow within the ﬁlament
during thinning and breakup.

In this paper, we compare the ﬁlament thinning and
breakup of Newtonian and viscoelastic ﬂuids of equal

shear viscosity in a microchannel cross geometry. Here
the outer Newtonian ﬂuid shears and stretches the inner
Newtonian or polymeric ﬂuid into a thin ﬁlament until
it eventually breaks up into drops. This geometry allows
for very ﬁne control of the ﬂows over a broad range of
shear rates, while the choice of ﬂuids emphasizes the role
of extensional viscosity in the thinning behavior. The lat-
ter allows comparison with a microscopic model relating
polymer extension to rheology.

The experimental conﬁguration is a cross slot mi-
crochannel, W = 50 µm wide and L = 30 µm deep,
molded in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, Dow Sylgard
184) using standard soft-lithography methods [15, 16].
Channels are sealed with a glass cover slip after exposure
to an oxygen plasma. In order to keep the microchannel
wetting properties uniform, the glass cover slip is coated
with a thin layer of PDMS prior to the exposure. The
assembled channels are then baked for 12 hrs at 100 ◦C
in order to obtain hydrophobic walls wetted by the con-
tinuous liquid phase.

The continuous phase is mineral oil containing 0.1% by
weight of surfactant (SPAN. 80). Two types of dispersed
phases are used: a Newtonian ﬂuid and a polymeric ﬂuid.
The Newtonian ﬂuid is a 90%-glycerin aqueous solution.
The polymeric ﬂuid is made by adding 100 ppm of high
molecular weight polyacrylamide (PAA, MW = 18 × 106,
15% polydispersity), which has a ﬂexible backbone, to an
85%-glycerin aqueous solution. It is dilute, well below the
overlap concentration of approximately 350 ppm. The
interfacial tension between the continuous and dispersed
phases is σ = 10 mN/m. Shear rheology is characterized
with a stress-controlled rheometer at 25 ◦C. As shown
in Fig. 1, the shear viscosities of the oil and Newtonian
ﬂuids are nearly identical and independent of shear rate:
ηs ≈ 0.24 Pa s. Also as shown, the viscoelastic poly-
meric ﬂuid exhibits a ﬁrst normal stress diﬀerence, N1,
which increases with shear rate. We ﬁt ηs and N1 data
to the widely-used FENE-P (ﬁnite extensibility nonlinear
elastic) model, in which the polymer molecules are rep-
resented as dumb-bells that can be stretched by a ﬁnite

relaxation time λ and a dimensionless ﬁnite extensibility
parameter b.

The dispersed and continuous phases are injected
into the central and side arms of the cross-channel, re-
spectively, using syringe pumps (Harvard Instruments).
Experiments are performed for ﬂow rate ratios, q =
Qoil/Qaq, ranging from 10 to 200. In all cases, the aque-
ous ﬂow rate is kept constant at Qaq = 0.01 µl/min.
This is low enough that the behavior is quasi-static, such
that the periodicity -but not the morphology- depends
Qaq. For this range of parameters, the Reynolds num-
ber is less than 0.01; therefore viscous forces are much
larger than inertial forces. Similarly the capillary num-
ber ranges from 0.02 to 0.8; therefore, viscous forces are
also larger than surface forces. Under these conditions an
aqueous ﬁlament is formed and stretched by the ﬂow of
the surrounding oil. The thinning and breakup of the ﬁl-
ament are imaged using an inverted microscope and a fast
video camera, with frame rates between 1 and 10 kHz.

Example stills from video data are shown in Fig. 2, for
both Newtonian and polymeric ﬂuids, at a ﬂow rate ratio
of q = 60. The Newtonian case, shown in the left-column,
displays typical ﬁlament thinning and drop formation.
The aqueous phase is drawn into the cross-slot channel
(a), and begins to elongate and collapse (b-d), forming
a primary drop connected by a very thin ﬁlament; later
(e) the ﬁlament thins at a faster rate and breaks into a
large primary drop and small satellite droplets.

The polymeric case, shown in the right-column of
Fig. 2, displays very diﬀerent behavior. Initially (a), we
observe a morphology that is similar to that of the New-
tonian ﬂuid, i.e. viscoelasticity is negligible at ﬁrst. As
the thinning progresses, the polymeric ﬂuid develops a
longer neck with a drop attached to it (b). This ﬁlament
elongates while thinning at a slower rate than in the New-

tonian case (c). Near the breakup event, the polymeric
ﬂuid shows multiple beads (‘beads-on-a-string’) attached
to the ﬁlament (d) [8, 10, 19]. After breakup, there are
many satellite drops (e).

Filament thinning may be quantiﬁed by the decrease
in diameter, h(t), as a function of time. To accomplish
this, we ﬁrst ﬁt a third-order polynomial equation to the
interface contour in the cross slot region. We then locate
the minimum in the polynomial ﬁrst derivative, and mea-
sure the ﬁlament diameter at this point. Example results
are shown in Fig. 3(a) for three ﬂow rate ratios, q = 10,
30, and 60. At short times, the Newtonian and polymeric
ﬂuids exhibit identical initial thinning, which is indicative
of their common shear viscosity. But at longer times, the
two diverge with the polymeric ﬁlament lasting at least
an order of magnitude longer before breakup.

The ﬁlament strain rate may be computed from h(t)
data by assuming a homogeneous uniaxial ﬂow inside
the ﬁlament with extensional strain rate equal to ˙ε =
−(2/h)dh/dt [20, 21]. Results for the same three ﬂow
rate ratios are given in Fig. 3(b). For the Newtonian
ﬂuid, ˙ε is initially independent of time; therefore, in this
regime, h(t) decreases exponentially with time. For the
polymeric ﬂuid, ˙ε is initially equal to the same constant
as for the Newtonian ﬂuid. But it soon departs and, af-
ter a transient interval, settles down to smaller constant
value, indicating a second regime of slower exponential
thinning. For all ﬂuids at the very latest times, close to
breakup, the ﬁnal decrease of h(t) to zero gives an appar-

ent divergence of ˙ε. We show in the following discussion
that the data just before breakup are consistent with a
linear decrease in ﬁlament diameter, h(t) ∝ (t−tb) where
tb is the breakup time.

To model the exponential decrease of ﬁlament di-
ameter, we start from an expression of stress balance
ηe ˙ε = ηe,oil ˙εoil, where left and right hand sides are
extensional viscosity times extensional strain rate for
the aqueous ﬁlament and continuous oil phases, respec-
tively. As noted above, the strain rate in the ﬁlament is
˙ε = −(2/h)dh/dt. The strain rate for oil in the cross-
slot region is ˙εoil ≈ Qoil/(W 2L), as veriﬁed by particle-
tracking methods [22]. And lastly, since the oil is New-
tonian, its extensional viscosity is ηe,oil = 3ηs,oil [23, 24].
Therefore, also assuming that ηe is independent of time,
the ﬁlament diameter thins exponentially according to

h(t) = ho exp[−(3/2)(ηs,oil/ηe) ˙εoilt].

(1)

where ho is an integration constant. In such ﬂow-driven
regimes, Eq. (1) may be used to deduce ηe from h(t) data.
The linear decrease of the ﬁlament thickness near the
ﬁnal breakup can also be modeled by stress balance, now
by incorporating surface tension eﬀects. Speciﬁcally, the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability eventually sets in so that
capillary forces cause beading and ultimately breakup.
Equating radial stress with the Laplace pressure gives
ηe ˙ε = σ/h [7, 25, 26]. Therefore, the ﬁlament diameter
thins linearly with time according to

h(t) = −(1/2)(σ/ηe)(t − tb),

regimes, Eq. (2) may be used to deduce ηe from h(t)
data.

To demonstrate the consistency of extensional viscos-
ity results from the ﬂow- and capillary-driven regimes,
we plot data for h(t) vs (σ/ηe)(t − tb) in Fig. 4. There,
the value of ηe is taken from analysis of the ﬂow-driven
regime using Eq. (1). To within apparently random de-
viations, h(t) data vanish linearly vs (σ/ηe)(t − tb) with
slope −1/2, in accord with Eq. (2). Note however that
the dynamic range is limited, since the imaging resolution
is about 2 µm. Therefore, the capillary-driven regime is
consistent with the ﬂow-controlled regime, but the latter
gives more accurate values of ηe.

Final results for extensional viscosity, ηe, based on
Eq. (1), are plotted in Fig. 5 vs extensional strain rate.
Here each point represents a diﬀerent ﬁxed ﬂow-rate ra-
tio, q. For the Newtonian ﬂuid, ηe is independent of
strain rate and nearly equals 3ηs as expected [23, 24].
This agreement serves as a second check, complementary
to Fig. 4. For the polymeric ﬂuid early in the ﬂow-driven
regime, the behavior is the same as for the Newtonian
ﬂuid (not shown). Later in the ﬂow-driven regime, the
extensional strain rate of the ﬁlament is lower and ηe
is higher. This behavior is due to the stretching of the
polymer molecules in the extensional ﬂow of the thinning
ﬁlament.

The extensional properties of polymeric ﬂuids are im-
portant for applications such as turbulent drag reduction
and splash suppression [23, 27]; however, measurement
of ηe has remained a diﬃcult task [28]. Our method
gives high-quality data, which may now be compared
with existing predictions. The FENE-P model is the
most widely-used. In Fig. 1, it well describes both the
shear viscosity and the ﬁrst normal stress diﬀerence vs
shear rate with three adjustable parameters. Using these
values, the FENE-P prediction for extensional viscosity

sional strain rate but much less slowly than predicted
by the widely-used FENE-P model. This suggests the
need for a better understanding of both the molecule-
scale behavior of polymers in extensional ﬂows as well as
its connection to macroscopic rheology. Filament thin-
ning in microchannels, and its variations with polymer
molecular weight, may be a promising approach.

is plotted in Fig. 5. It exhibits strain-hardening, which
saturates at high strain rates by accounting for the ﬁ-
nite extensibility of the polymer molecules. However, by
comparison with our data, the predicted strain harden-
ing sets in too soon and too abruptly. A possible cause
for this discrepancy may be polymer dispersivity (∼15%
in MW ), which can smear out the sharp rise in ηe [9].
It cannot, however, account for such early transition to
strain hardening behavior since λ ∼ MW

3/2.

In conclusion, small amounts of ﬂexible polymer can
dramatically aﬀect ﬁlament thinning and breakup in
micro-channel extensional ﬂow.
In contrast to macro-
scopic observations, we ﬁnd both a ﬂow-driven regime in
which the ﬁlament thins followed by a capillary-driven
regime responsible for ﬁlament breakup. For a Newto-
nian ﬂuid, the ﬁlament thins exponentially with time
until onset of capillary surface tension-induced breakup.
For a polymeric ﬂuid, with the same shear viscosity - in-
dependent of shear rate, there is an intermediate regime
in which the ﬁlament thins exponentially at a much
slower rate. Furthermore the capillary regime features
generation of a series of small droplets along the ﬁlament.
These diﬀerences may be attributed solely to extensional
viscosity, and its increase with extensional strain rate,
since this is the only rheological diﬀerence between the
Newtonian and polymeric ﬂuids. For thinner ﬁlaments
and faster thinning, the polymer molecules stretch and
cause an increase in extensional viscosity without signif-
icant change in shear viscosity. Measurements of the ex-
ponential rate of thinning can thus be used to determine
extensional viscosity, an elusive quantity to measure. For
the Newtonian case, ηe is three times the shear viscosity;
for the polymeric case, the results increase with exten-

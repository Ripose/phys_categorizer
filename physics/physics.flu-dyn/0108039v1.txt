The role of geometrical micro-barriers on the conversion eﬃciency of reactive ﬂows in narrow three-
dimensional channels of millimetric size is investigated. Using a Lattice-Boltzmann-Lax-Wendroﬀ
code, we show that micro-barriers have an appreciable eﬀect on the eﬀective reaction eﬃciency of
the device. If extrapolated to macroscopic scales, these eﬀects can result in a sizeable increase of
the overall reaction eﬃciency.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the outstanding frontiers of modern applied
physics/mathematics consists in the formulation of mod-
els and numerical tools for the description of complex
phenomena involving multiple scales in space and time
[1]. An important example of complex multiscale phe-
nomena is the dynamics of reactive ﬂows, a subject
of wide interdisciplinary concern in theoretical and ap-
plied science. The complexity of reactive ﬂow dynamics
is parametrized by three dimensionless quantities: the
Reynolds number Re = U L/ν, the Damkohler number
Da = τh/τc, and the Peclet number P e = U H/D. Here
U , L and H denote the macroscopic ﬂow speed and lon-
gitudinal/transversal lengths of the ﬂow respectively, ν is
the ﬂuid kinematic viscosity and D the pollutant molec-
ular diﬀusivity. The quantities τc and τh represent typi-
cal timescales of chemical and hydrodynamic phenomena.
High Reynolds numbers are associated with turbulence.
High Damkohler numbers imply that chemistry is much
faster than hydrodynamics, so that reactions are always
in chemical equilibrium and take place in tiny regions.
In the opposite regime the chemistry is slow and always
takes place at local mechanical equilibrium. Finally, high
Peclet numbers imply that the transported species stick
tightly to the ﬂuid carrier. Varying Re
P e and
considering diﬀerent device morphologies meets with an
enormous variety of chemico-physical behaviours [2]. In
this work we deal with low-Reynolds, fast-reacting ﬂows
with heterogeneus catalysis. In particular we wish to gain
insights into the role of geometric micro-irregularities on
the eﬀective absorption rate of tracer species at catalytic
boundaries. For a detailed study see also [3].

II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF REACTIVE
MICROFLOW DYNAMICS

We deal with a quasi-incompressible, isothermal ﬂow
with soluted species transported (advect and diﬀuse) by

the ﬂow and, upon reaching solid walls, they undergo
catalytic chemical reactions. The basic equations of ﬂuid
motion are:

(i) ∂tρ + div ρu = 0 and (ii) ∂tρu+div ρuu =

P +div[2µ(

u + (

u)T )+ λ divu]

∇

−∇

∇
where ρ is the ﬂow density, u the ﬂow speed, P = ρT
the ﬂuid pressure, T the temperature and µ, λ are the
shear and bulk dynamic viscosities respectively (for the
present case of quasi-incompressible ﬂow with divu
0
the latter can safely be ignored). Finally, uu denotes the
dyadic tensor uaub, a, b = x, y, z.

≃

Multispecies transport with chemical reactions is de-
scribed by a generalized continuity-diﬀusion equation for
each of s = 1, ..., Ns species:

∂tCs + divCsu =
div[DsCT ∇

(Cs/CT )] + ˙Ωsδ(x

xw) ,

−

(1)

where Cs denotes the mass density of the generic s-th
species, Ds its mass diﬀusivity, CT = Ps Cs the total
mass of transported species and ˙Ωs is a chemical reaction
term whose contribution is non-zero along the reactive
surface described by the coordinate xw (δ(x) is the usual
Dirac delta function). In the following the subscripts w
and g mean “wall” (solid) and “gas” in a contact with
the wall respectively.

According to Fick’s law, the outgoing (bulk-to-wall)
diﬀusive mass ﬂux (molecules per unit surface and time)
is given by (hereafter species index s is omitted for sim-
plicity):

Jg→w =

D∂⊥Cg|wall

−

where ∂⊥ denotes the normal-to-wall component of the
gradient. Upon contact with solid walls, the transported
species react according to the following empirical rate
equation:

˙Ω

≡

where ∆V is the volume element of the reactive wall and
∆S is the surface element across which ﬂuid-wall mass
transfer takes place. In our case the ratio ∆V /∆S is sim-
ply the thickness of the reactive wall. Kc is the chem-
ical reaction rate dictating species consumption once a
molecule is absorbed by the wall.
In the following we
will use the common linear assumption

∆S

Jg→w

where Kw is the wall-ﬂuid mass transfer rate. In prac-
tice each boundary cell can be regarded as a microscopic
chemical reactor sustained by the mass inﬂow from the
ﬂuid. Chemistry (Eqs. 2, 3) sets a time-scale for the
steady-state mass exchange rate. At steady state we ob-
tain:

Hence

Cw =

Kw
Kw + Kc

Cg .

Jg→w

,

where τw = 1/Kw and τc = 1/Kc. These expressions
show that ﬁnite-rate chemistry (Kc > 0) ensures a non-
zero steady wall outﬂux of pollutant.

The ﬂow ﬁeld is solved by a Lattice Boltzmann Equa-
tion (LBE) method [4–7] while the multispecies transport
and chemical reactions are handled with a variant of the
Lax-Wendroﬀ method (LW) [8]. The LW scheme repre-
sents a numerically convenient choice recently developed
to address multicomponent ﬂuid transport (and reaction)
within a LBE-like language.

A. Multiscale considerations

In this study, the unperturbed geometry of the cat-
alytic device is a straight channel of size L lattice units
H
along the ﬂow direction (positive x direction) and H
across it (y and z axes). We add to this unperturbed ge-
ometry a single protrusion (barrier) of unitary thickness
at a ﬁxed x = L/2 with height h in the z direction, and
spanning the channel in the y direction (see Fig.1).

This problem involves at least four relevant time-
scales. The relevant ﬂuid scales are the advective and
momentum-diﬀusive time:

where Φ(x) = R [uC](x, y, z)dydz is the longitudinal mass
ﬂow of the pollutant at section x and u is the x compo-
nent of u (v and w will be the y and z components re-
spectively). The in-out longitudinal ﬂow deﬁcit is equal
to the amount Γ of pollutant absorbed at the catalytic
wall per unit time.

The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize
Γ at a given Φin. This means maximizing complex
conﬁguration-dependent quantities, such as the wall dis-
tribution of the pollutant and its normal-to-wall gradient.
For future purposes, we ﬁnd it convenient to recast the
catalytic eﬃciency as η = 1
T , where T is the channell
transmittance T
Φout/Φin. Roughly speaking, in the
limit of fast-chemistry, this is controlled by the ratio of
advection to diﬀusion timescales. It is intuitive that high
eﬃciencies are associated with large values of the ratio
τA/τD, namely low-Peclet numbers.

We now discuss the main qualitative eﬀect of the

micro-barrier from a microscopic point of view.

2

Firstly, it provides a potential enhancement of reac-
tivity via the increase of the surface/volume ratio. How
much of this potential is actually realized depends on the
resulting ﬂow conﬁguration.

Here, the ﬂuid plays a two-faced role. First, geomet-
rical restrictions lead to local ﬂuid acceleration, hence
less time for the pollutant to migrate from the bulk to
the wall before being convected away by the mainstream
ﬂow. This eﬀect may become appreciable on micro-scales
for micro-ﬂows with h/H
0.1 (like in actual catalytic
≃
converters). Moreover, obstacles shield away part of the
active surface (wake of the obstacle) where the ﬂuid cir-
culates at much reduced rates (stagnation) so that less
pollutant is fed into the active surface. The size of the
shielded region is proportional to the Reynolds number
of the ﬂow. On the other hand, if by some mechanism
the ﬂow proves capable of feeding the shielded region,
then eﬃcient absorption is restored simply because the
pollutant is conﬁned by recirculating patterns and has al-
most inﬁnite time to react without being convected away.
This case is met mainly in presence of suﬃciently ener-
getic turbulent ﬂuctuations at high values of the micro

barrier-Peclet number P eh = w

We now turn to the case of a “perturbed” geometry.
Let us begin by considering a single barrier of height h
(Fig. 1). The reference situation is a smooth channel at
high Damkohler (Eq. 6). From [3] we ﬁnd an estimate
of perturbative corrections in the smallness parameter

where A = H/L is the aspect ratio of the channel, Sc =

parameter. The wake length W can be estimated by
W/h = KReh with K
0.1. Three distinctive cases
can be identiﬁed: (i) a = 0: the wake region is totally
deactivated, absorption zero; (ii) a = 1: absorption in
the wake region is exactly the same as for unperturbed
ﬂow; (iii) a > 1: the wake absorption is higher than
with unperturbed ﬂow (back-ﬂowing micro-vortices can
hit the rear side of the barrier).

The computational scheme has been applied to a ﬂuid
ﬂowing in a millimeter-sized box of size 2
1 mil-
limeters along the x, y, z directions with a perpendicular
40
barrier of height h (see Fig. 1). Upon using a 80
grid, we obtain a lattice with dx = dy = dz = 0.0025
(25 µm). We assume a real sound speed Vs = 300 m/s
which becomes cs = 1/√3 in lattice units. Therefore a
time-step is equivalent to dt = cs dx/Vs ≃
The ﬂow is forced with a constant volumetric force
which mimics the eﬀects of a pressure gradient. The
ﬂuid ﬂow carries a passive pollutant which is continu-
ously injected at the inlet with a ﬂat proﬁle across the
channel. Diﬀusing across the ﬂow, it reaches solid walls
where it reacts according to a ﬁrst order catalytic reac-
tion: C + A
P , where A denote an active catalyzer
and P the reaction products. The initial conditions are:

50ns.

The pollutant is then released at the open outlet, while
ﬂow periodicity is imposed at the inlet/outlet bound-
aries. On the upper and lower walls, the ﬂow speed is
forced to vanish, whereas the ﬂuid-wall mass exchange is
modelled via a mass transfer rate equation of the form
previously discussed. Our simulations refer to the fol-

400, Da > 80 (see also Eq. 4). In order to study the
eﬀects of the barrier height h, we consider the follow-
ing values: h = 0, 2, 4, 8. The typical simulation time is
t = 32000 time-steps (about 1.6 milliseconds in physical
time) corresponding to two mass diﬀusion times across
the channel. We may estimate the reference eﬃciency for
the case of smooth channel: with ¯U
0.1, and τ = 20,

we obtain l

A typical two-dimensional cut of the ﬂow pattern and
pollutant spatial distribution in the section y = H/2 is
shown in Figs. 2 and 3, which refer to the case h = 8.
An extended (if feeble) recirculation pattern is well
visible past the barrier. Also, enhanced concentration
gradients on the tip of the barrier is easily recognized
from Fig. 3. The integrated concentration of the pollu-
tant C(x) = Py,z C(x, y, z) is presented in Fig. 4 for the
cases h = 0, 2, 4, 8. The main highlight is a substantial
reduction of the pollutant concentration with increasing
barrier height. We measure also the the pollutant lon-
gitudinal mass ﬂow Φ(x). The eﬃciency η is deﬁned by
Eq. 5. The results are shown in Table I, where subscript
A refers to Eq. 7 with a = 1. These results are in a
reasonable agreement with the analytical estimate apart
deviations h = 8 for which the overall eﬃcency is overes-
timated. Leaving aside the initial portion of the channel,

VII. UPSCALING TO MACROSCOPIC DEVICES

It is important to realize that even tiny improvements
on the microscopic scale can result in pretty sizeable cu-
mulative eﬀects on the macroscopic scale of the real de-
vices, say 10 centimeters. The eﬃciency of an array of N
serial micro-channels can be estimated simply as

ηN = 1

T N .

(8)

−
It is readily recognized that even low single-channel ef-
ﬁciencies can result in signiﬁcant eﬃciencies of macro-
scopic devices with N = 10
100 (see Fig. 7). Equation
−
8 with numerical data from present simulations provide
satisfactory agreement with experimental data [9,10].

Nonetheless, extrapolations based on Eq. 8 must be
taken very cautiously in the case of rugh or fractal walls
[11] or of fully developed turbulence.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

Although these simulations generally conﬁrm qualita-
tive expectations on the overall dependence on the ma-
jor physical parameters, they also highlight the existence
of non-perturbative eﬀects, such as the onset of micro-
vorticity in the wake of geometrical obstrusions, which
are hardly amenable to analytical treatment.

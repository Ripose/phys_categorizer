Upper bounds on the bulk energy dissipation rate ǫ and enstrophy dissipation rate χ are derived
for the statistical steady state of body forced two dimensional turbulence in a periodic domain. For
1/2
a broad class of externally imposed body forces it is shown that ǫ ≤ kf U 3Re−1/2
and χ ≤ k3
where U is the root-mean-square velocity, kf is a wavenumber (inverse
length scale) related with the forcing function, and Re = U/νkf . The positive coeﬃcients C1 and C2
are uniform in the the kinematic viscosity ν, the amplitude of the driving force, and the system size.
We compare these results with previously obtained bounds for body forces involving only a single
length scale, or for velocity dependent a constant-energy-ﬂux forces acting at ﬁnite wavenumbers.
Implications of our results are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The study of two dimensional turbulence was originally
justiﬁed as a simpliﬁed version of the more complex three
dimensional turbulence, but it has come to be regarded
as an interesting research ﬁeld in its own right with deep
connections to geophysical and astrophysical problems
such as as strongly rotating stratiﬁed ﬂows [1]. A large
number of experimental methods have been devised to
constrain ﬂows in two dimensions (e.g. soap ﬁlms) al-
lowing some theories theories to be tested in the lab [2].
Direct numerical simulations are far easier than the three
dimensional case, and this has enabled researchers to in-
vestigate two dimensional turbulence computationally at
much higher Reynolds numbers [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. As a
result, there are more simulation data to test theories of
two dimensional turbulence. Nevertheless many funda-
mental questions remain open; see [1] for a recent review.
The inviscid conservation of enstrophy as well as en-
ergy in two dimensions results in two cascading quadratic
invariants that make the phenomenology of two dimen-
sional turbulence somewhat more complex than three di-
mensional turbulence and not derivable from simple di-
mensional arguments. Theoretical studies of turbulence
usually employ a statistical description and often involve
assumptions about homogeneity isotropy and the nature
of the interactions. Based on physical arguments, Kraich-
nan [9], Leith [10] and Batchelor [11] conjectured that
there is a dual cascade in two dimensional turbulence:
energy ﬂows to the larger scales while enstrophy moves
to the small scales (when the system is driven at some
intermediate scale). Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor (KLB)
theory assumes isotropy and homogeneity in the limit of
inﬁnite domain size, and in the zero viscosity limit pre-
dicts a k−5/3 energy spectrum for the large scales and a
k−3 energy spectrum for the small scales. The assump-

tions of the KLB theory, as well as the power index and
the universality of the two energy spectra has been ques-
tioned in the literature [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

In this paper we derive some simple rigorous bounds
for the long time averaged bulk energy and enstrophy dis-
sipation rates for two dimensional statistically stationary
ﬂows sustained by a variety of driving forces. The study
of physically relevant rigorous bounds on the energy dis-
sipation rate, i.e., the power consumption of turbulence,
for a class of boundary-driven ﬂows can be traced back to
the seminal work of Howard [19], and in recent years an
alternative approach [20] has renewed interest in those
kinds of problems, providing direct connections to exper-
iments in some cases. Bounds for the energy dissipation
of steady body forced ﬂows—more convenient for theo-
retical and numerical investigations—in three dimensions
have been derived by Foias [21] and others [22, 23, 24, 25].
Not unexpectedly, Foias et al. [26] also derived a bound
for the enstrophy dissipation rate in the statistically sta-
tionary states of two-dimensional turbulence driven by
a restricted class of forces. Bounds for the energy and
enstrophy dissipation in two dimensional ﬂow driven by
a monochromatic forcing were derived in [27] and [16].
The case of temporally white noise forcing was studied
by Eyink [28]. More recently Tran el at [29, 30] derived
bounds of the enstrophy dissipation for freely decaying
two dimensional turbulence in terms of the initial ideal
invariants of the ﬂow. (See also [31] for the treatment
of the same problem in terms of the inviscid Euler Equa-
tions). Finally, we mention that bounds on the dimension
of attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes have been derived
in [32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and more recently by [37].

The results for the energy and enstrophy dissipation of
forced ﬂows derived in this paper apply to a more gen-
eral type of forcing than the single scale forcing that was
considered in [16, 27]. We also consider forces that are

2

(7)

(9)

smoothly varying in time, unlike the white noise forcing
investigated in [28], and we are particularly interested in
the behavior of the long times averaged dissipation rates
in the vanishing viscosity limit. Because the viscosity is
a dimensional quantity we must specify what we mean
by “small” viscosity. To be precise, we measure the mag-
nitude of the viscosity in terms of the Reynolds number
in the statistically steady state,

results for time-dependent but single-length scale forcing
and “ﬁxed-ﬂux” forces in order to establish the stronger
results in (4). The concluding section V contains a brief
discussion of the results and their implications.

II. TIME-INDEPENDENT FORCING

Re =

(1)

Consider a two dimensional periodic domain [0, L]2,
L, ﬁlled with an incompressible ﬂuid of unit density

i.e., T2
evolving according to the Navier-Stokes equation:

where U is the root mean square velocity and kf is a
natural wavenumber (inverse length scale) in the driving
force. The dissipation rates are also dimensional quanti-
ties, so we measure them in terms of the inviscid scales
determined by U and kf . That is, we estimate

β =

ǫ

and

γ =

χ

in terms of Re and focus on the Re
limit holding
other parameters (such as the large scale eddy turnover
time in the most general case) ﬁxed. For a broad class of
external driving we ﬁnd that

→ ∞

β . Re

−1/2

and

γ . Re0,

(3)

consistent with an enstrophy cascade of sorts.

However, for special cases of forcing such as “ultra
narrow band” monochromatic (i.e., involving on a single
length scale, albeit with a broad range of time depen-
dence) forcing, or for a ﬁxed energy ﬂux forcing popular
for direct numerical simulations, a stronger bound holds:

β . Re

−1

and

γ . Re

−1.

(4)

This kind of Re−1 scaling suggests “laminar” ﬂows where
the energy is concentrated at or above the smallest length
scale of the forcing. This sort of scaling has been shown
before in the literature [16, 27] for monochromatic forcing
and for white noise in time forcing [28].

In every case the bounds derived here are strictly less
than those available –or expected– for three dimensional
turbulence. The upper bounds (3) on the energy and
enstrophy dissipation for two dimensional ﬂows derived
here are in a sense a consequence of combining the ap-
proaches in [26] and [16, 28] applied to a class of forcing
functions concentrated in a ﬁnite range of length scales.
Even though some steps in our analysis have been taken
before, in order to make this paper self-contained the
complete (but nevertheless short) proofs will be presented
here.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the
next section II we introduce the problem and basic deﬁni-
tions, and perform the analysis leading to (3) for the sim-
plest case of time independent body forces. Section III
generalizes the analysis to include a broad class of time-
In section IV we brieﬂy review the
dependent forces.

We are considering the Reynolds number to be the
“control parameter” even though it is deﬁned in terms
of the emergent quantity U . Strictly speaking the ﬂow is
determined by the structure and amplitude of the body
force (and the initial data) so the Grashof number such
as Gr = F/k3
f ν2 should naturally be used as the rele-
vant dimensionless control parameter indicating the in-
tensity of the driving and the resulting ﬂow.
Indeed,
while we can always realize any given value of Gr, it is
not at all evident that every particular value of Re can
be achieved. Nevertheless, in order to express the results
in terms of quantities familiar to the theory of homoge-
neous isotropic turbulence we will (without loss of rigor)
express the bounds in terms of Re.

mensional turbulence; this is related to the outstanding
open question of the regularity of solution for the three
dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. As the results of
this paper suggest quantitatively, the dissipation rates
of two dimensional turbulence falls somewhere between
laminar scalings and the rates for three dimensional tur-
bulence.

An even sharper scaling bound on the energy and en-

is monochromatic in space, whether it is steady or time
dependent [16, 27]. Suppose the body force involves only
a single length scale, i.e.,

This does not preclude complex time-dependence for

Hence also in this case both β and γ are bounded

Note that in both these derivations a condition like

It is an
open question whether such a condition holds for more
general and more “realistic” forcing functions. The re-
sults (32) and (35) give restrictions on the energy and
enstrophy dissipation rate for a broader class of driving,
but it is natural to wonder how broad of a class of forc-
ing functions would actually result in the Re−1 scalings
in the vanishing viscosity limit.

V. DISCUSSION

These quantitative bounds show that for two dimen-
sional turbulence sustained by forces as described in the
previous sections, there is no residual dissipation in the
at ﬁxed
vanishing viscosity limit deﬁned by Re

U , L, kf and Ωf . To be precise, ǫ vanishes at least as
fast as Re−1/2 in this limit. This conﬁrms that there is
no forward energy cascade in the steady state in the in-
viscid limit. On the other hand the residual enstrophy
dissipation allowed by (32) in this limit does not rule out
0
a forward enstrophy cascade. This combination, ǫ
with χ =
(1) in the inviscid limit, is consistent with the
dual-cascade picture of two-dimensional turbulence de-
veloped by Kraichnan [9], Leith [10] and Batchelor [11].
Note however that the absence of forward energy cas-
cade is not necessarily true for any ﬁnite value of Re.
Re−1/2 scaling allowed by the bound is less

On the other hand the direct cascade of enstrophy
is necessarily absent for some forcing functions (see
[16, 27, 28]). When the forcing acts at a single scale or

Re−1. This suggests an

ergy spectrum follows a power law E(k)
wavenumbers then the exponent must be α
5 for χ
to vanish in the vanishing viscosity limit. These results
have been interpreted as absence of enstrophy cascade
in ﬁnite domains. However, both of these results rely
on the condition (44) which is not guaranteed for a gen-
eral forcing functions. Whether (44) might hold for more
general forcing functions is an open question; the results
(32) and (35) give the restrictions on the energy and en-
strophy dissipation rate for a general forcing. Note that
Re−1/2 does not impose signiﬁcant restriction
the β
on the energy spectrum given the bound on χ. These
considerations suggest that it is possible therefore that in
two dimensional turbulence the steady state energy spec-
trum depends on the type of forcing used, even within the
class of relatively narrow-band driving. High resolution
numerical simulations with forcing that does not neces-
sarily satisfy (44) would be useful at this point to resolve
this issue.

∼

We conclude by noting that an interesting question
that follows from these results is that of the Re-scaling
of the energy dissipation in systems that almost have
two dimensional behavior like strongly rotating, strongly
stratiﬁed or conducting ﬂuids in the presence of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld. For example, is there a critical value of
the rotation such that the scaling of the energy dissi-
pation rate with the Reynolds number transitions from
Re−1/2? These questions remain for
Re0 to ǫ
ǫ
future studies.

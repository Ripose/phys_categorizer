This letter describes a periodically oscillating microfoam ﬂow. For constant input parameters,
both the produced bubble volume and the ﬂow rate vary over a factor two. We explicit the link
between foam topology alternance and ﬂow rate changes, and construct a retroaction model where
bubbles still present downstream determine the volume of new bubbles, in agreement with experi-
ment. This gives insight into the various parameters important to maintain monodispersity and at
the same time shows a method to achieve controlled polydispersity.

Formation and ﬂow of bubbles in microﬂuidic systems
attract an increasing attention [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], while poten-
tial applications cover a wide range of ﬁelds varying from
biology to biomedicine (ultrasound contrast agents) to
chemistry (microreactors). Recently these studies have
been extended to the low liquid fraction case [7, 8] in
which microfoams are formed. Microfoams are interest-
ing because of the large number of interfaces that can
potentially be used as a transport vector for amphiphilic
molecules. Another positive aspect is the excellent con-
trol over the volume of the dispersed phase (monodisper-
sity) with a volume variation smaller than 3 % [2]. This
is an important factor e.g. for the synthesis of new micro-
materials (solid microfoams). Recently a new set of op-
erations called ‘discrete microﬂuidics’ [9] has showed the
way to integrate microfoams in lab-on-a-chip systems.

In this letter we will show the generation of a micro-
foam with a periodical oscillation in its bubble volume.
This is an unexpected eﬀect in microfoam ﬂows for which
at constant input parameters both gas ﬂow rate and bub-
ble volume show a large periodic oscillation. We can ex-
plain it by linking bubble volume to resistance to ﬂow
of a foam in a channel. This resistance depends on the
bubble volumes downstream and on the foam topology
therefore the volume of a new bubble is related to the one
of its predecessors. One could state that the bubble for-
mation process has a memory. This can be used for the
generation of microbubble aggregates with a controlled
and potentially tunable polydispersity. It will also play
an important role in deﬁning design criteria for systems
in which monodispersity is important, both for foams
as for emulsions with a large viscosity contrast between
continuous and dispersed phase. The theoretical model
provides an eﬀective tool to predict the sensibility of the
system to perturbations in monodispersity. It will help to
select beforehand the right geometrical and experimental
parameters.

We use a conventional ﬂow-focusing geometry [1, 2, 3]:

an inlet channel for the liquid, another one for the gas,
both ending in a small oriﬁce followed by a straight chan-
nel section (oriﬁce width wor = 100 µm, channel width
w = 1 mm, height h = 100 µm, outlet channel length 16
mm). The walls of the system are made in PDMS glued
to a glass cover slide. A syringe pump (11 PicoPlus,
Harvard Apparatus) is used to push the liquid (deion-
ized water with 10% commercial diswashing detergent
Dreft, Proctor&Gamble). For the dispersed gas phase
we use nitrogen supplied from a pressurized tank via a
pressure reduction valve. The exit is at atmospheric pres-
sure. Therefore we have access to the imposed pressure
drop over the total system (oriﬁce and outlet channel).
We use a CMOS camera (F131B, Allied Vision Technolo-
gies) connected to a macro lens to capture still images
and to record movies of the two-phase ﬂow. Via image
analysis, we extract the bubble volume Vb, bubble for-
mation frequency f , from which we deduce the gas ﬂow
rate Qg = Vb f .

Here we present a case in which for constant input pa-
rameters Pg and Ql the bubble volume and gas ﬂow rate
periodically oscillate over more than a factor 2 (see Fig.
1). A typical cycle starts with a foam consisting of two
rows of bubbles (that we name F2 foam). See Fig. 1 b).
The ﬂow rate grows, and at the same time the bubble vol-
ume Vb of newly formed bubbles at the oriﬁce increases.
This increase is followed by a transition of the foam topol-
ogy in the channel from two rows to one row of bubbles
(F2 to F1 foam) (see Fig. 1 c)). Now the foam starts
slowing down while the bubble volume at the entrance
is shrinking. This is followed by another transition, this
time from F1 to F2 (Fig. 1 d)). When the last F1 bub-
bles are evacuated from the channel a new cycle can start.
Over the whole cycle the bubble formation frequency f
stays constant. This is consistent with earlier measure-
ments [8] that showed that for bubble formation at high
dispersed phase volume fraction, f only depends on the
liquid ﬂow rate Ql. Therefore there is a linear relation
between the volume of a newly formed bubble and the
velocity v at which the foam ﬂows: Vb = Qg/f = vS/f .
Velocity is homogeneous over the channel. Image analy-
sis shows no compressibility eﬀects in agreement with the
small pressures (typically a few kPa). The foam behaves

like a plug ﬂow.

We stress that the bubble formation process itself is
stable while the ﬂow is not. We are in the high-pressure
regime where the gas-water interface pinches oﬀ but stays
in the oriﬁce [8]. Non-linearities due to rapid gas-water
interface retraction upstream of the oriﬁce after bubble
pinch-oﬀ like in [10] do not play a role. Pinch-oﬀ is stable,
both in periodicity and spatial position. For a slightly
lower driving pressure Pg, we observe a monodisperse F2-
foam. A slightly higher pressure leads to a monodisperse
F1-foam.

A key element for the understanding of the oscillation
are the topological transitions (from F1 to F2 and vice
versa). The dominant force in a foam is surface tension,
tending to minimize bubble surface for a given bubble
volume. It is known that a foam is usually stuck in a local
energy minimum an does not reach the global minimum
[11]. The method used for the preparation of the foam
is the determinant factor. This also holds for our case
in which for the same Vb we can both have an F2 and
an F1 foam. Furthermore the very elongated F1 bubbles

2

are obviously far from minimising their surface to volume
ratio. The formation process in this conﬁned geometry
plays an important role.

We explain the topology selection mechanism by the
interplay between bubble formation at the oriﬁce and the
shape assumed by the preceding bubbles. We will dis-
cuss ﬁrst F1 and F2 formation, before describing transi-
tions. In the case of the bubble formation for an F1 foam,
the new bubble will ﬁrst form a circular shape centered
around the oriﬁce (see pictures in Fig. 2 a). A three-fold
vertex (three meeting ﬁlms) is formed at the point where
the wall, the new bubble and the preceeding one meet.
These vertices slide over the channel walls. The F2 for-
mation is a bit more complex (see Fig. 2 b). Here again
formation of a bubble starts with a spherical cap, with
a vertex on each side. Because of the inherent asymme-
try of an F2-foam the distance between these two ver-
tices and the preceeding ones is unequal. Between the
two vertices at shortest distance a T1-transition (bubble
neighbour switching [12]) takes place alowing the newly
formed foam to relax to the F2 state.

The transition from F1 to F2 takes place when the
volume Vb of the new bubble becomes that large that the
inter-vertex distance is too large to allow a T1 (see Fig. 2
c). We will call this volume V12: the threshold volume for
transition from F1 to F2. The opposite transition takes
place at a much smaller bubble volume because of the
absence of preexistent asymmetry: bubble volume has
to reduce a lot (smaller than V21) before the inter-vertex
distance is that small that the situation becomes unstable
(probably because of interaction with previous ﬁlm), that
a top or bottom vertex slides faster, triggers a T1 upon
contact with the previous ﬁlm, thereby completing the
transition (2 d).

For our channel geometry the transition F1 to F2 takes
place at V12/hw2 = 0.193 and the inverse at V21/hw2 =
0.536. There is a large hysteresis (a factor 2.8 between
these two volumes). The diﬀerence in transition bubble
volume probably depends heavily on the liquid fraction
as this is the determinant factor for the vertex distance at
which a T1 rearrangement is triggered [12, 13]. Therefore
we expect that the amplitude of the oscillation will be less
pronounced for wetter foams.

We complete the explanation of the oscillating behav-
ior by making a link between foam topology and rheology.
Driving pressure Pg is related to foam velocity v by the
channel resistance to ﬂow (dissipation). The foam speed
is oscillating for constant driving pressure, therefore the
channel resistance must oscillate as well. The principal
source of dissipation for foam ﬂow in a channel is the
sliding of the liquid ﬁlms between bubbles over the chan-
nel walls [14, 15]. Channel resistance scales linearly with
the total length of these ﬁlms in the channel. Orienta-
tion plays an important role. For a ﬁlm of length L the
relevant length scale is the projected length Lp = L cos α
with α the angle between the normal vector of the ﬁlm
and the ﬂow direction. Introducing the capillary number
Ca = µv/σ containing the bubble velocity v (estimated

Rtotal, takes into account the Nb bubbles in the channel.
In addition, we enforce foam topology transitions at the
bubble volumes V12 and V21, which completes the model.

Essentially we calculate Vb
by numerical integration
over all the bubbles in the channel. Therefore a bubble
inﬂuences the volume of its successors during its presence
in the channel, so while travelling from the oriﬁce to the
channel exit. Thereby creating a retroactive eﬀect.

A comparison between experiment and model is shown
in Fig. 3 conﬁrming that we capture the essential of the
physics. The model reproduces the oscillation frequency,
the gas ﬂow rate and number of bubbles in the channel
nicely.

taking into account the bottom and top wall of the chan-

Larger volumes would violate Plateau’s law saying that
three ﬁlms must always meet at equal angles. Therefore

Summing over the projected lengths of all the bubbles
in the channel gives the total resistance prefactor and
thereby the capillary number Ca (and gas ﬂow rate Qg)
at a given applied pressure drop, from equation 1.

To model the foam ﬂow we proceed in the following
way. The bubbling frequency f being constant whatever
the bubble size, we predict the volume of a new bubble
to be Vb = Qg/f . Using equation 1, we obtain the gas
ﬂow rate Qg as a function of the bubbles downstream in
the channel, and thus the next bubble volume, at a given
discretised time tf = n, from

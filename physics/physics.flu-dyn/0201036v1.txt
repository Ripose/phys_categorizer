Abstract

In the selective withdrawal experiment ﬂuid is withdrawn through a
tube with its tip suspended a distance S above an unperturbed two-ﬂuid
interface. At low withdrawal rates, Q, the interface forms a steady state
hump and only the upper ﬂuid is withdrawn. When Q is increased (or
S decreased), the interface undergoes a transition so that the lower ﬂuid
is entrained with the upper one, forming a thin steady-state spout. Near
this discontinuous transition the hump curvature becomes very large and
displays power-law scaling behavior. This scaling is used to show that
steady-state proﬁles for humps at diﬀerent ﬂow rates and tube heights
can all be scaled onto a single similarity proﬁle.

Scaling at the selective withdrawal transition

Itai Cohen, Sidney R. Nagel

July 31, 2013

Is it possible to classify topological transitions in nonlinear ﬂuid systems [1,
2, 3, 4] in the same manner as one classiﬁes thermodynamic transitions? When
the topological transition involves formation of a singularity in the ﬂuid ﬂows
or interface shapes, a similarity solution can provide a simpliﬁed description
of the ﬂows and help make such a classiﬁcation [5]. A crucial component to
this approach involves determining how characteristic physical quantities and
lengths describing the ﬂuid system scale near the singularity. In many cases
these singularities manifest themselves in the transition dynamics [6, 7, 8, 9]
and do not appear in the steady state ﬂows. Here, we report on steady-state
interface proﬁles near the topological transition associated with the selective
withdrawal experiment. Despite the transition being discontinuous, scaling of
the interface is observed as the transition is approached.

In the selective withdrawal experiment a tube is immersed in a ﬁlled con-
tainer so that its tip is suspended a height S above an unperturbed interface
separating two immiscible ﬂuids. When ﬂuid is pumped out through the tube
at low ﬂow rates, Q, only the upper ﬂuid is withdrawn and the interface is
deformed into an axi-symmetric steady-state hump (Fig. 1) due to the ﬂows
in the upper ﬂuid. The hump grows in height and curvature as Q increases or
S decreases until the ﬂows undergo a transition where the lower ﬂuid becomes
entrained in a thin axi-symmetric spout along with the upper ﬂuid. The two-
ﬂuid interface becomes unbounded in the vertical direction thus changing the
topology of the steady state. Once the spout has formed, an increase in Q or
decrease in S thickens the spout.

The interfacial proﬁles at diﬀerent ﬂow rates and tube heights are recorded.
Near the transition, the steady-state radius of curvature of the hump tip is
orders of magnitude smaller than the length scales characterizing the boundary
conditions (e.g. the tube diameter, D). This separation of length scales suggests
that a similarity analysis of the steady-state hump proﬁles might be possible.
However, for the range of parameters explored thus far, even when the system
is arbitrarily close to the transition from hump to spout, the mean curvature
of the hump tip, κ, while large, remains ﬁnite. Nevertheless, by ﬁxing S and
looking at the steady-state proﬁles as Q is increased, we observe that both the
hump curvature and height display scaling behavior characteristic of systems
approaching a singularity. Since the divergence is cut oﬀ before a singularity is
reached this transition appears to be “weakly-ﬁrst-order.”

Figure 1: Photograph of two-ﬂuid interface forming a hump. The parameters for
this problem include the height of the tube from the unperturbed interface, S,
withdrawal rate, Q, surface tension of the two-ﬂuid interface, γ, ﬂuid densities,
ρu and ρl, ﬂuid viscosities, ηu and ηl, tube diameter, D, ﬂuid height above
the interface, ﬂuid height below the interface, container size, and surfactant
concentration. Here we restrict the investigation to the S vs. Q parameter
space and defer discussion of the remaining parameters to [10].

As shown in Fig. 1, the parameters important for this experiment are the
upper and lower ﬂuid viscosities and densities (ηu, ηl, ρu, ρl), interfacial tension
(γ), oriﬁce diameter (D), tube height (S), and ﬂow rate (Q). In looking for
scaling of the steady-state proﬁles, care must be taken to design an experimental
apparatus capable of isolating the proﬁles near the transition. Experiments were
performed in large tanks (30cm × 30cm × 30cm) capable of holding ﬂuid layers
that were each about 12 cm in height. To ensure that the upper ﬂuid level
remained constant, the withdrawn ﬂuid was recycled back into the container
(the bottom ﬂuid layer thickness remains constant when the system is in the
hump state). Steady withdrawal rates were achieved by using a gear pump.
We veriﬁed that for the tube diameter (D = 0.16 cm), tube heights (0.1 cm
≤ S ≤ 1.1 cm), and ﬂow rates (Q ≤ 10 ml/sec) used in the experiments, the
container walls were suﬃciently distant and the ﬂuid layers suﬃciently thick so
as not to aﬀect the ﬂows [10]. We measured the upper(Heavy Mineral Oil) and
lower(Glycerin-Water mixture) ﬂuid viscosities to be ηu = 2.29 St and ηl = 1.90
St, the upper and lower ﬂuid densities to be ρu = 0.88 g/ml and ρl = 1.24 g/ml,
and the surface tension[11, 12] to be γ = 31 dynes/cm. Attempts to increase
κ near the transition by decreasing γ cause ﬂuid mixing and result in a diﬀuse
interface at high shear rates so that some fraction of the lower ﬂuid is always
being withdrawn [13].

While many of the parameters mentioned inﬂuence the ﬂows, our under-
standing of the scaling behavior can be conveyed by focusing on S and Q. We
can ﬁx Q and track the development of the hump proﬁles as a function of S.
Below the tube height, Su, the hump is unstable and undergoes a transition to
a spout. Figure 2 shows that Su ∝ Q0.30±0.05 [14]. At low Q the transition is
hysteretic: the value of S where the spout becomes unstable and decays back
into the hump is larger than Su. We deﬁne the diﬀerence of the two heights
or hysteresis as ∆S. Figure 2 indicates that the data is consistent with an ex-
ponential decrease: ∆S = 0.04 exp−Q/0.032. For Q > 0.1 ml/sec, ∆S was too
small to measure.

In order to measure the mean curvature of the hump tip, κ, we ﬁrst ﬁt the
tip of the recorded proﬁle with a Gaussian and then calculate the curvature
of the ﬁtting function at the hump tip. Figure 2 also shows the hump height,
hu, and mean radius of curvature, 1/κu, at the transition as a function of Q.
The dramatic decrease in ∆S coincides with the onset of a ﬂat asymptotic
dependence for 1/κu at Q > 0.1 ml/sec. We quantify this correlation, by ﬁtting
the curvature data with the form 1/κu = 0.02 + 0.32 exp−Q/0.032 which has the
same exponential decay with Q as does ∆S. For Q > 0.1, ml/sec we ﬁnd both
κu, and hu to be independent of the oriﬁce diameter D [10]. We restrict our
scaling analysis to this regime.[15]

Figure 3a plots κ (where 0 ≤ κ ≤ κu), versus Q for six data sets correspond-
ing to diﬀerent values of S. As shown in the inset of Fig. 3a, all ﬁfteen data sets
display a power-law divergence for κ, as Q approaches Qc (a ﬁtting parameter).
While the power-law exponents remain constant as S is varied, the prefactors
to the power laws, cκ(S), vary slightly with S and are scaled out in the inset.
Figure 3b plots the hump height, hmax, versus Q. The inset to Fig. 3b shows

Figure 2: Plots of the transition tube height, Su, hysteresis, ∆S, hump height,

Su ∝ Q0.30±0.05 (solid line). The ∆S data is ﬁt with an exponential decay
(dashed) of the form: ∆S = 0.04 exp−Q/0.032 although the range is not suﬃcient
to exclude a power-law decay. We ﬁt 1/κu (dash dot), with the form: 1/κu =

that as Q approaches Qc (obtained from Fig. 3a inset), the hump height ap-
proaches hc (a ﬁtting parameter) as a power law. Once again, the power-law
exponents for these data sets are the same over this range of S. The prefactors,
ch(S), are scaled out in the inset. Note that Qc changes with S indicating that
the system can approach a continuous line of divergences. Combining the two
scaling dependencies in Fig. 3c, we plot (hc −hmax)/hmax versus the normalized
curvature, κ/n. We ﬁnd that (hc − hmax)/hmax scales as (κ/n)0.85±0.09 indi-
cating that even though both hc and the power-law prefactor, n, change with
S, the power-law exponents are independent of S for this range of tube heights.
Note that n(S) = ch(S)[cκ(S)0.85]. The transition cuts oﬀ the evolution of the
hump states making it impossible for the system to approach arbitrarily close
to the singularity and limiting the precision with which we can determine the
exponents.

The scaling observed for hmax and κ suggests that the hump proﬁles should
display universal behavior as hmax nears hc. The quantities 1/(κ/n) and (hc −
hmax)/hmax track how quickly the radial and axial length scales decrease as the
system approaches the singularity and are therefore used to scale the proﬁles.
We deﬁne the scaled variables:

H(R) =

hc − h(r)
hc − hmax

and

R =

rκ
n

,

(1)

where h(r) is the hump proﬁle and hc is taken from Fig. 3. The transformation
shifts the proﬁles so that under scaling the singularity occurs at the origin and
the maximum hump heights occurs at H = 1 and R = 0. Figure 4 shows eight
scaled proﬁles for the S = 0.830 cm data set. In the bottom inset we overlay the
hump proﬁles scaled in the main ﬁgure. We ﬁnd excellent collapse of the proﬁles.
The solid line in Fig. 4 is a power law that ﬁts the data in the region beyond
the parabolic tip. The picture that emerges is of a parabolic tip region which
decreases in its radial scale and is simultaneously pulled towards the singularity
in the axial direction leaving behind it a power-law proﬁle with an exponent
of 0.72 ± 0.08. This exponent is within error (although slightly smaller) of the
exponent observed in the scaling relation of Fig. 3c which predicts an exponent
of 0.85 ± 0.09.

Typically, the observed scaling dependencies in these types of problems result
from the local stress balance. A scaling analysis where the viscous stresses
of the upper and lower ﬂuids balance the stress arising from the interfacial
curvature predicts linear scaling dependencies and conical proﬁle shapes. The
non-linearity of the observed dependencies indicates that either a diﬀerent stress
balance governs the ﬂows (e.g. only viscous stress due to upper ﬂuid balances
stress due to the interface curvature) or that non-local eﬀects are coupling into
the solution. A more detailed discussion can be found in [10].

Finally, we compare the similarity curves for ﬁve diﬀerent tube heights in
the upper right inset of Fig. 4. The proﬁles all display the same power-law
dependence. Within error, the normalized curvature κ/n (taken from Fig. 3c)
can be used to scale the radial components of these proﬁles and obtain good
collapse. In Fig. 3c we ﬁnd that the normalization prefactors, n, decrease as

Figure 3:
Scaling for the mean hump tip curvature, κ, and height hmax. 3a
plots κ vs. Q for six tube heights. Each curve displays diverging behavior with
increasing Q. For each tube height we choose a critical ﬂow rate Qc as a ﬁtting
parameter and show (3a inset) that as Q approaches Qc the curvatures increase
as power laws. The prefactors to the curvature power laws, cκ(S), are scaled
out in the inset. Figure 3b plots hmax vs. Q for six tube heights. For each S
we choose a critical hump height hc as a ﬁtting parameter. As Q approaches Qc
(taken from 3a inset), the hump heights approach the critical heights as power-
laws. The prefactors, ch(S), to the power laws in the inset are scaled out.
Figure 3c plots (hc − hmax)/hmax vs. κ/n for the entire data set corresponding
to ﬁfteen diﬀerent straw heights. The prefactor n roughly decreases as exp−2.5S.
The line corresponds to a power-law with an exponent of -0.85.

exp−2.5S. Here, we correlate this decrease with the observation that the proﬁles
become shallower at larger S. The points of deviation for the S = 0.255 cm and
0.381 cm proﬁles mark the transition from the similarity regime to the matching
regime beyond which the proﬁles become asymptotically ﬂat. At large enough
radii all of the scaled proﬁles display these deviations.

We have shown that in the Q > 0.1, ml/sec regime, a similarity analysis
can be used to describe the ﬂows near the selective-withdrawal transition [16].
We have observed power-law scaling of the hump height and curvature (Fig.
3) and used these scaling relations to collapse the hump proﬁles at diﬀerent
ﬂow rates and tube heights onto a single universal curve (Fig. 4). However,
the origin of the saturation of κ at large Q remains an important unexplained
problem. Further insight into this cutoﬀ behavior may be gained by comparing
with an analogous two-dimensional (2-D) problem which roughly corresponds
to replacing the tube with a line sink. Jeong and Moﬀatt [17] showed that in
an idealized case where the bottom ﬂuid is inviscid while the top ﬂuid is very
viscous, the 2-D hump interface forms a 2-D cusp singularity above suﬃciently
high withdrawal rates. Recently, Eggers [18] showed that the solution changes
when the lower ﬂuid has a ﬁnite viscosity; the system no longer manifests a
singularity [19].
Instead, the approach to the singularity is cut oﬀ and the
system undergoes a transition to a diﬀerent steady state. In this new state, a
sheet of the lower ﬂuid is entrained along with the upper ﬂuid into the line sink.
However, the ﬁnite lower ﬂuid viscosity prevents the hump proﬁles from scaling
onto a similarity solution.

Here, we have shown that for the three-dimensional selective withdrawal sys-
tem even when both ﬂuids are viscous (η > 1 St for both ﬂuids) the eﬀects of
a singularity manifest themselves in the scaling of the hump proﬁles. Further-
more, preliminary experiments show that a reduction of the lower ﬂuid viscosity
to 0.01 St has little eﬀect in determining the ﬁnal curvature of the hump tip
or equivalently, how close the system is to forming a cusp. This suggests that
for our 3-D problem, either the eﬀects of the lower ﬂuid viscosity enter as a
higher-order perturbation to the proﬁle shapes, or a diﬀerent mechanism un-
derlies the avoidance of the cusp formation. If the latter scenario is correct, it
may be possible for the system to manifest the singularity at a ﬁnite lower ﬂuid
viscosity. In either case, determining which variables aﬀect how close the sys-
tem approaches the singularity would allow for control of the maximum hump
curvature and minimum spout diameter. This control could then be used to ad-
vance technologies such as coating microparticles [20], creating mono-dispersed
micro-spheres [21], and emulsiﬁcation through tip streaming [18, 22] which take
advantage of the selective withdrawal geometry.

[14] For systems with a diﬀerent upper ﬂuid viscosity, we ﬁnd that the power-law
dependence changes. There is a vast literature which focuses on explaining
the Su vs. Q dependence (e.g. [13]). We therefore defer the detailed discus-
sion of how currently available scaling predictions compare with the data
to [10].

[15] Note that the transition from spout to hump is also discontinuous indi-
cating that there is a curvature cut-oﬀ for the spout states as well. Since
surfactants are continuously being removed from the interface when the
system is in the spout state, the presence of surfactants in our system is
not enough to account for the discontinuous nature of the transition or
equivalently the values of the curvature cut-oﬀs. More generally, we ﬁnd
that surfactant eﬀects do not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the results presented.
A more detailed discussion is presented in [10].

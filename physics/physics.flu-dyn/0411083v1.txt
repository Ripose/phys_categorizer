Abstract. The dynamics of a small Prandtl number binary mixture in a laterally heated cavity is studied
numerically. By combining temporal integration, steady state solving and linear stability analysis of the
full PDE equations, we have been able to locate and characterize a codimension-three degenerate Takens-
Bogdanov point whose unfolding describes the dynamics of the system for a certain range of Rayleigh
numbers and separation ratios near S=-1.

1. Introduction

Double-diffusive ﬂuxes occur when convection is driven by thermal and concentration gradients, and the
temperature and concentration diffusivities take different values. This phenomenon has relevance for nu-
merous applications (Turner, 1985), and from a theoretical point of view presents very interesting dynamics,
including chaos (Cross and Hohenberg, 1993; Knobloch et al., 1986). We are interested here in the case
of horizontal gradients (Turner, 1980; Jiang et al., 1991). In this conﬁguration, quiescent (conductive) so-
lutions can exist when thermal and solutal buoyancy forces exactly compensate each other. This occurs
only for a very particular value of the separation ratio (S =
1, see below), but has allowed for theoretical
analysis by studying the stability of the conductive solution (Ghorayeb and Mojtabi, 1997; Xin et al., 1997;
Bardan et al., 2000; Bergeon and Knobloch, 2002). In recent work, we addressed this case for a small
Prandtl number binary mixture, including only the Soret effect (Meca et al., 2004). Results showed a quite
interesting bifurcation scenario by varying the Rayleigh number. In particular, we found an orbit that is
born in a global saddle-loop bifurcation, becomes chaotic in a period doubling cascade, and disappears in a
blue sky catastrophe (Shilnikov, 1997). This orbit is the only stable solution in a large interval of Rayleigh
numbers. In this paper we analyze this system in greater depth to determine how the scenario associated to
the origin of this orbit is modiﬁed when the value of S is changed to larger (i.e. less negative) values. It is

relevant to assess to what extent the dynamics depends on tuned values of the parameters, or whether it is
fairly robust to these changes. Moreover, by varying a second parameter we gain access to a richer portrait
of the system, obtaining bifurcation lines and points of codimension two.

We have numerically integrated the full PDE equations in a region near S =

1, combining steady state
solving, numerical continuation, linear stability analysis, and temporal integration. The results show that
distinct bifurcations of the S =
1 case (namely two saddle nodes and a global saddle loop) approach each
−
other in the region near S =
0.9 until only a Hopf bifurcation remains, in a scenario consistent with the
unfolding of a codimension-three degenerate Takens-Bogdanov point.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we detail the model and the numerical procedure. In
Section 3 the behavior of the system for S =
1 is reviewed. In Section 4 we extend these results by letting
both Ra and S vary. Finally, the discussion of the results and some concluding remarks are presented in
Section 5.

2. Basic equations and numerical methods

We consider the 2-D ﬂux of a binary mixture in a rectangular cavity Ω of length d and height h. The
aspect ratio Γ = d/h has been chosen to be 2. The cavity is laterally heated, maintaining different constant
temperatures at the opposed vertical boundaries. ∆T is the difference between both temperatures. On the
horizontal boundaries, a linear temperature proﬁle is imposed. All the boundaries are taken to be no-slip and
with no mass ﬂux. In these conditions the dimensionless equations in Boussinesq approximation explicitly
read

In these equations lengths, times and temperatures are scaled with h, tκ = h2/κ and ∆T , respectively, κ

(vx, vz) is the (dimensionless) velocity ﬁeld in (x, z) coordinates, P is
the pressure over the density, θ and C are deviations from a linear horizontal proﬁle of the temperature and
of the rescaled concentration of the heavier component, respectively. The dimensionless parameters are the
Prandtl number σ = ν/κ, the Rayleigh number Ra = αgh3∆T /νκ and the Lewis number τ = D/κ, where
ν denotes the kinematic viscosity, g the gravity level, α the thermal expansion coefﬁcient, and D is the
α ST , where ST is the Soret coefﬁcient,
mass diffusivity. The separation ratio is deﬁned by S = C0(1
C0 is the actual value of the concentration of the heavier component in the homogeneous mixture, and β
is the mass expansion coefﬁcient (positive for the heavier component). Finally, boundary conditions are
written as

These boundary conditions are not compatible with the transformation of the Soret equations into those used
by Ghorayeb and Mojtabi (1997); Xin et al. (1997); Bardan et al. (2000); Bergeon and Knobloch (2002).
Note also that Eqs. (1) together with boundary conditions (2), are invariant under a rotation π around the
C). Therefore the system is
point (Γ/2, 1/2) as (x, z)
Z2-equivariant (Kuznetsov, 1998). From now on solutions invariant (non-invariant) under π will be called
symmetric (non-symmetric).

Eqs. (1) and boundary conditions (2) have been solved by a second order time-splitting algorithm,

To calculate steady solutions, we have adapted a pseudoespectral ﬁrst-order time-stepping formulation
to carry out Newton’s method, as described by Mamun and Tuckerman (1995); Bergeon et al. (1998);
Xin and Le Qu´er´e (2001). In the preconditioned version of Newton’s iteration, the corresponding linear
system is solved by an iterative technique using a GMRES package (Frayss´e et al., 2003). The linear stability
analysis of the steady states is conducted by computing the leading eigenvalues of the Jacobian by means

3. Scenario for S = −1

−

In this section we summarize the behavior of the system for a separation ratio S =
1 (Meca et al., 2004).
The bifurcations diagram of the steady solutions is shown in Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, the Nusselt number N u,
deﬁned as the ratio of the heat ﬂux through the hot wall to that of the corresponding conductive solution, is
represented as a function of the Rayleigh number Ra. For the sake of clarity, only one of the non-symmetric
solutions related by π is represented. For this value of S the conductive solution is allowed. For small
Ra this solution is stable, but loses stability at Ra = 541.9 through a transcritical bifurcation (T1). The
resulting solutions are symmetric by the rotation π, and are characterized by a central main roll accompanied
by secondary ones in opposed corners. The supercritical branch is stable only until Ra = 542.4, where a
small non-symmetric branch connects it to the conductive solutions through pitchfork bifurcations, a case
analogous to that reported by Bardan et al. (2000). We center the discussion here on the solutions originating
from the subcritical branch. This solution is stabilized by a saddle node bifurcation at Ra = 99 (SN1)
and loses stability again in a Pitchfork bifurcation at Ra = 245 (P ), where a stable non-symmetric branch
appears. In Fig. 2 (left) we see that the breaking of the symmetry conﬁnes the main roll to one lateral
side. Continuing the symmetric branch, a supercritical Hopf bifurcation at Ra = 2137 (H1) (maintaining
symmetry) is found. At Ra = 2253 the bifurcating periodic solution gains stability in a Pitchfork bifurcation.

circle denotes a global saddle-loop bifurcation.

Furthermore, the steady non-symmetrical solution undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation at Ra = 1209
(SN2) and has a saddle-saddle turning point at Ra = 865.6 (T P ). Further along this branch, a Hopf
bifurcation can be found at Ra = 2218 (H2). A detail of this branch in the region of the two turning points
is represented in Fig. 2 (right). Here, the variable Ek, related with the kinetic energy and deﬁned as

is plotted versus the Rayleigh number Ra. In this ﬁgure we have also included the sign of the real part of
the leading eigenvalues; a parenthesis is used to indicate a complex conjugated pair. Between both turning
points an homoclinic saddle loop connection at Ra = 1184 (SL) gives birth to a periodic non-symmetric
solution (Meca et al., 2004). This orbit, which is the only stable solution in a wide range of values of the
Rayleigh number Ra, is characterized by very long periods and a spiking behavior. In particular at the SL
connection its period diverges logarithmically as expected.

When the Rayleigh number is increased, a very interesting complex behavior of this orbit arises
(Meca et al., 2004). Firstly, at Ra = 2137 the orbit starts to show ripples, reﬂecting the frequency corre-
sponding to the Hopf bifurcation H1, while the period increases dramatically. In the region near Ra = 2235
the orbit undergoes a period doubling cascade, becoming chaotic. At Ra = 2257.5 the chaotic attractor
disappears in a blue sky catastrophe, in a scenario similar to that proposed by Shilnikov and Turaev (2000)
in which both length and period of an orbit diverge at the bifurcation point.

4. Results for S > −1

We have performed both steady state and temporally dependent calculations of the system for different
values of S above
1. We have centered our research on the solutions from which the non-symmetric orbit
is born in a global saddle loop (SL) connection. Namely, we are referring to the non-symmetric branch
with two successive turning points (SN2 and T P ), between which the SL connection is found. This is the
situation represented in Fig. 2 (right) for S =

This conﬁguration of bifurcations changes when S is increased. The sequence of events in this region is
0.8920 only a Hopf
quite complex, but the ﬁnal situation is simple. Remarkably, for values around S =
bifurcation remains. To analyze this process we present in Fig. 3 results for this branch and different S values.
In this ﬁgure, branches and local bifurcations are found by continuing steady solutions and performing linear
stability analysis, whereas global bifurcations are located by temporal integration. To do this, we ﬁx a value
of S, and starting from a periodic solution as initial condition, we vary slightly the Rayleigh number while

monitoring the value of the period of the ﬁnal stable orbit. Then, the connection is located at the point
where the period diverges.

The ﬁrst qualitative change occurs between S =

0.9, where the global connection SL moves
−
toward the saddle node SN2, becoming a SNIC (saddle node on an invariant circle) in a saddle node
loop (SNL) codimension-two bifurcation. This change is manifested in the law of divergence of the period
T found by temporal integration of the bifurcating orbit for Ra toward the homoclinic connection. The
divergence for the SL is logarithmic, i.e.

where Rac is the value for which the global connection takes place and λ is the eigenvalue of the jacobian
matrix associated to the unstable direction of the hyperbolic solution. The divergence changes to square
root for the SNIC:

−

0.8990. In Fig 3 we see the branch for S =

−
Here, Rac corresponds to the position of the saddle node. Furthermore, as we increase S, the point at
which the two positive eigenvalues merge to become a pair of conjugated complex values (see Fig. 2 right)
approaches the turning point (T P ) until a Takens-Bogdanov (TB) codimension-two bifurcation occurs there
for S near
0.897, for which the T B has unfolded to a Hopf
bifurcation and a global saddle loop connection, which constitute the birth and the end of an orbit that has
been calculated by temporal integration. The divergence of the period of this orbit at the saddle loop is
again logarithmic, as in Eq. 4. Therefore for this value of S we obtain both divergences, logarithmic for
the SL and square root for the SNIC. We have performed ﬁts of the periods for both points. Indeed, the
λ value obtained by the ﬁt, λf it = 0.0173, agrees fairly well with the eigenvalue obtained by the stability
calculation of the steady state (λ = 0.0166). For the SNIC, Rac(f it) = 856.64, and the value of SN2 is
Rac = 856.67. In this situation the eigenvalue that became positive at SN2 gains stability at T P . At the
Hopf bifurcation the solution loses stability again.

−

When S is slightly increased, an additional codimension-two SNL bifurcation is found at SN2, the
SNIC becoming an SL moving away from the saddle node. At this moment, both SL are approaching each

corresponding homoclinic orbits are shown in Fig. 4. They are both logarithmic, with ﬁtted values for the
eigenvalues being λf it = 0.00968 and 0.0118, according well with the steady calculations λ = 0.00820 and
0.0134, respectively.

Very soon afterwards they touch each other and disappear. By S =

0.894 no global connection remains
in this branch. It is now possible for the two turning points (SN2 and T P ) to annihilate each other in a
0.8928. The ﬁnal situation, in which only the
codimension-two cusp bifurcation. That occurs for S =
Hopf bifurcation is found, is represented by the S =

0.892 branch of Fig. 3.

5. Discussion and concluding remarks

In the preceding section we have numerically studied the change of an interesting branch of non-symmetric
solutions when a second parameter (the separation ratio S) is varied. The scenario that emerges from these
results consists of a series of codimension-two bifurcations arranged to enable two destabilizing saddle
nodes of a branch connected to an orbit by a global bifurcation to disappear, resulting in a simpler situation
with only a local Hopf bifurcation.

−

These results can be summarized by drawing bifurcation lines and codimension-two points in an (S, Ra)
plot. This is shown in Fig. 5. In this ﬁgure the two turning point lines meet in a cusp bifurcation at
0.8928. We can track the larger eigenvalues of the system along these lines. We ﬁnd that at S =
S =
0.8990
the solution on the line T P has a double zero eigenvalue. This indicates the presence of a Takens-Bogdanov
(TB) codimension-two point. Indeed, this can also be checked by noting that, by performing linear stability
analysis, a branch of Hopf bifurcations, with very low frequency starting from zero, also begins at this
point. It should be stressed that in order for both turning points to be effectively annihilated T P should
become stabilizing. That happens at the TB point.

−

The existence of a TB bifurcation also implies the existence of a branch of homoclinic connections
(saddle-loop). This is, in fact, one of the few analytical methods of proving the existence of a homoclinic
orbit. We have used the time evolution code to situate the line of homoclinic connections as detailed in Sec.
4, and checked if the period of the orbit diverges following the logarithmic law (Eq. 4). Indeed the values
found for λf it did agree well with the eigenvalues calculated from the stability of the steady solutions. The
ﬁtting of the value of Rac yields the points marked in Fig. 5. We see that the line that joins these points is
connected with the saddle-node line corresponding to the SN2 points. This connection is SN L1 (located
very close to S =
0.897), one of the saddle-node separatrix-loop points (Schecter, 1987) mentioned above.
It is at this point that the branch of homoclinic connections merges with the saddle-node line to become
an SNIC line. This is conﬁrmed by the change of the logarithmic law for the divergence of the period (Eq.
4) to the square root of Eq. 5.

If we keep following the SNIC line toward more negative separation ratios, we ﬁnd the other codimension-
two saddle-node separatrix loop point (SN L2, at S =
0.92, not shown in Fig. 5) where the SNIC line
ends, giving birth again to a homoclinic bifurcations line separated from the saddle-node line. Following
this line until S=-1 we recover the SL point at Ra = 1184.

−

This particular conﬁguration of codimension-two bifurcations is very far from being peculiar of this
problem. It is found in many other areas, such as bursting oscillations in neural or biological systems
(de Vries, 1996; Borisuk, 1997), population dynamics (Bazykin, 1985), laser dynamics (Mayol et al., 2002),
and some diffusively coupled systems (Kanamami and Sekine, 2003). Theoretically, all this behavior can be
reproduced as a 2-dimensional slice in parameter space of the unfolding of a codimension-three degenerate
Takens-Bogdanov point (Dumortier et al., 1991), also known as the Dumortier-Roussarie-Sotomayor (DRS)
bifurcation. In particular, we are referring to the focus case described by Dumortier et al. (1991). This is
also consistent with the fact that the presence of the SNIC cannot be related to a local codimension-2
phenomenon (Golubistky et al., 2001).

The scenario in which the DRS bifurcation appears can be described by a planar vector ﬁeld (Dumortier et al.,

1991), i.e. it is essentially two-dimensional. This suggests the possibility of calculating the normal form
coefﬁcients of the bifurcation from the PDE’s, which is an interesting problem from a theoretical point of
view.

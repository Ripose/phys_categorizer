The classical problem of the ﬂuid mechanics is the problem of a supersonic motion around

a thin body was generalized to the case of non-equilibrium gas. The drag and lift force

coeﬃcients were founded. It is shown that the drag and lift force coeﬃcients in the acoustically

active supersonic ﬂow are both decreased.

Introduction.

The classical problem of the ﬂuid mechanics is the problem of a supersonic motion

around a thin body. One of the problem demanding generalisation on a case of an

non-equilibrium media, is the problem of a supersonic ﬂow past the thin body, [1,2].

This problem, in particular, was investigated in [3,4] in linear approach for a case of

inviscid ﬂow of non-equilibrium gas. The unwidely expressions for lifting force which

are not admitting generalisations on a non-linear case were received. The results of

experimental and numerical investigations of the properties of supersonic ﬂows around

blunt bodies in the presence of electric discharge in stream and in the front of the body

were given in [5,6]. The essential decreasing of the drag force was observed.

The present paper considers the supersonic motion of the non-equilibrium gas

around a thin body up to the order of ∼ ε3, where ε is a small parameter. Drag

and lift force, as is known, connected with the impulse which is carried away by shock

2

waves. However in acoustically active media the structure of a acoustic ﬁeld is de-

ﬁned by second viscosity coeﬃcient µ ≫ η, [7,8], where η is the ﬁrst (shear) viscosity

coeﬃcient. Since the acoustic ﬁeld structure around a body is suﬃciently changed.

Therefore the neglect by dissipative processes becomes incorrect, [9].

We consider a plain supersonic ﬂow (M = v0/us > 1 is the Mach number, v0 is

ﬂow speed far from a body, us is sound velocity) around a thin body (lx/ly ≫ M) with

a small attack angle δ = ly/lx ≪ 1. Here ly is eﬀective thickness, lx is length of a

body. Further we examine the integrated characteristics of a ﬂow - drag and lift force

coeﬃcients Cx;y

Cx;y = (1/2ρ0v2

P nx;yds

Z

where ρ0 is a gas density in inﬁnity, P is a gas pressure in a point (x,y), nx;y are

components of a normal vector. The integration is conducted along an airfoil surface.

Pressure on an airfoil surface can be represented in form P = P0 + P1, where P0 is a

gas pressure in inﬁnity, P1 = ρ0v0v1 − ρ0(v2

x + v2

y)/2 is disturbance of pressure, vx; y

are components of the ﬂow velocity perturbations.

Statement of the problem and main results

The assumption formulated permit to use of the equations which describe the ﬂuid

motion in form of Navier-Stoces which must be completed with the equation of state

and energy. In the non-equilibrium gas for perturbations of parameters these equations

up to the of (2 order for the high-frequency perturbations (( ” 1 lead to the following

The similar equations are well known in the theory of non-linear ion-sound waves,

gravitational waves on a surface of a liquid etc. Here α∞ is spatial increment of acoustic

instability within the limits of frozen relaxation of internal degrees of freedom ωτ ≫ 1,

µ∞ = 4η/3 + κ(1/cV ∞ − 1/cP ∞). With a conclusion of Eq.(2) it was necessary, that the

characteristic length of energy dissipation α−1

∞ is small in comparison with longitudinal

scale of a body lx. For the decision of the problem, the Eq.(1) needs to be added by a

boundary condition for normal components of speed of gas. In case of ﬁrm walls

In space above a body (y ¿ 0) it is possible to consider nx = −∂ζ2/∂x and under a

body nx = −∂ζ1/∂x, where y = ζ2;1(x) are equations of the top and bottom proﬁle

surface.

For the further simpliﬁcation of considered model the method of the consecutive

approaches is used, by choosing as the initial decision of the Eq.(1), as a simple wave.

The non-linear acoustic theory for non-equilibrium gas [8], predicts an opportunity of

stabilisation of acoustic instability developing with α∞ < 0, if µ∞ > 0, in the second

order of the theory of perturbations. The Eq. (3) has the limited decisions in form of

the sawtooth wave [8]. Other kind of the limited decisions with α∞ < 0, if µ∞ > 0 this

equation does not admit.

Passing to account of coeﬃcients Cx;y, notice, that in a considered problem, by

virtue of small nx;y, expression for P1 will be transformed to a kind: P1 = −ρ0v0∂φ/∂x,

[1]. These coeﬃcients are expressed through coeﬃcient of pressure CP = (1/2ρ0v2

on a airfoil surfaces. The value CP on both surfaces up to the accepted accuracy is

deﬁned by expression:

Let’s deﬁne angles of attack of the top and bottom lines of a proﬁle to it chorde by

expressions θ2;1(x) = ∂ζ2;1/∂x − δ. Let’s notice, that here ζ2;1 = lx, ζ2;1(lx) = 0. Then

under the form with received in [8] for acoustic perturbations in the motionless non-

equilibrium media. The Eq. (3) and model, presented in [8] were received by means

5

of the perturbation methods, use the same small parameters. Since the description of

the acoustic ﬁeld structure around the body up to the third order of the perturbation

theory can be received by means of the variables transformations in the basic equations

of the same order, presented in [8]. After transformations, in approach ωτ ≫ 1 we

come to the following results:

Conclusions.

It is shown that on the base of the results of non-linear theory of the acoustic waves

in the non-equilibrium media [8] the non-linear structure of the acoustic ﬁeld, generated

by proﬁle in the supersonic ﬂow of non-equilibrium gas up to the third order of the

perturbations theory can be described easily. The integrated characteristics of a ﬂow

6

around the airfoil (drag and lift force coeﬃcients Cx;y) in the non-equilibrium gas were

received.

The presented results demonstrate dependence of the drag and lift forces in the

non-equilibrium gases from the degree of non-equilibrium. The drag and lift force

coeﬃcients in the acoustically active supersonic ﬂow are both decreased. The given

eﬀect is connected with the appearance of the additional pressure gradient ∇Pnoneq ∼

α∞lx, directed opposite to the classical gradient ∇Peq.

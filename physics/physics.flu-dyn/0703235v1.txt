Abstract

We study numerically the induction mechanisms generated from an array of helical motions

distributed along a cylinder. Our ﬂow is a very idealized geometry of the columnar structure that

has been proposed for the convective motion inside the Earth core. Using an analytically prescribed

ﬂow, we apply a recently introduced iterative numerical scheme [16] to solve the induction equation

and analyze the ﬂow response to externally applied ﬁelds with simple geometries (azimuthal, radial,

etc.). Symmetry properties allow us to build selected induction modes whose interactions lead to

dynamo mechanisms. Using an induction operator formalism, we show how dipole and quadrupole

dynamos can be envisioned from such motions.

INTRODUCTION

The understanding of the self-sustained dynamo of the Earth is still a major challenge.

Following Larmor’s original hypothesis [1], it is supposed to originate in the convective mo-

tion inside the liquid iron core. There, the induction due to ﬂuid motions may overcome the

Joule dissipation and a dynamo can be generated. Although knowledge of the ﬂuid motion

is essential because it drives the magnetic induction, the structure of the core convective

motion is not precisely known. It is due to the extreme range of parameters in this problem:

the Earth is in rapid rotation, and the electrical conductivity of molten iron is large, but

ﬁnite. As a result, two important dimensionless parameters of the problem are very small:

the Eckman number may be as low as 10−15 and magnetic Prandtl number of the order

of 10−6 [2] are usually quoted. In addition, the source of the convective motion is mixed

and still debated: thermal and compositional convection contribute, with heat exchanged

at the boundaries (solidiﬁcation of the iron at the solid inner core, transfer at the mantle

boundary) and heat is also released in the bulk because of radioactivity [3]. The Rayleigh

and Nusselt numbers are not precisely known, and the coupling with the magnetic ﬁeld can

result in signiﬁcant changes in the structure of the convective ﬂow. However, many models

of the Earth dynamo have invoked the columnar ﬂow structure ﬁrst derived by F. Busse [4]

at onset of convection in a spherical Couette geometry [5]. These columns may persist for

a system moderately above the onset of convection [6, 7] although their existence in the

actual Earth core is still an open question [8]. There are also arguments for a subcritical

dynamo bifurcation [9], in which the columnar structure may be stabilized by the large scale

magnetic ﬁeld [10].

The focus of this paper is on the induction mechanisms that result from the existence

of such a columnar structure. We consider a highly idealized situation in which columns

with helical motion are distributed along a cylinder, as helicity is known to favor dynamo

action [11]. The geometry is chosen to be cylindrical so that the conical and curves conditions

of the Earth are ignored. We also do not take into account the drift of Busse’s rolls, nor the

presence of a zonal wind. The ﬂow is prescribed, and we analyze its response to externally

applied ﬁelds with simple geometries (azimuthal, radial, etc.) in order to understand the

induction mechanisms in this system. For instance, several numerical simulations (e.g. [12]

and references therein) have noticed that both dipole and quadrupole dynamos are possible,

2

with thresholds in close proximity. Note that the periodic array of helical columns in the

Roberts ﬂow [13] and Karlsruhe dynamo [14] cannot generate an axial dipole. We show here

that the annular geometry can lead to both axial dipoles and quadrupoles. We describe in

detail the ﬂow structure and the numerical method in section II. In sections III we present

our results concerning induction responses to simple applied ﬁelds. Section IV is devoted to

the study of possible dynamo action in this type of ﬂows, based on an operator formalization.

Conclusions and possible extension of the study are presented in section V.

II. SYSTEM AND METHODS

A. System

The ﬂow geometry is made of a system of cylindrical columns forming an annulus, as

shown in ﬁgure 1. The columns are grouped in pairs of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic roll, for

which the axial ﬂow is reversed. The velocity is assumed to be stationary and is expressed as

the sum of a contribution due to the circular motion of the ﬂuid in a column (the rotational

component VR(r)) and of a contribution due to an axial motion, which we label VA(r). In

an Earth-like geometry, VA(r) would be generated by the Eckman pumping at upper and

lower boundaries. One thus writes

V(r) = VR(r) + ξVA(r) ,

(1)

We chose analytical expressions of the ﬁelds such that the components are separately

divergence-free, ∇ · VR(r) = ∇ · VA(r) = 0. The coeﬃcient ξ measures the intensity of the

axial motion compared to the rotational one.

The rotational part in columns of height 2H is expressed in cylindrical polar coordinates

as:

where n is the number of column pairs, R is the outer radius of the annulus, d is the thickness

3

of the region in which the columns are conﬁned (within radial distances between R − d and

R). The velocity is set to zero outside the domain R − d ≤ r ≤ R.

For the axial ﬂow, we consider two cases. In the ﬁrst one, the columns have a height

2H and the axial ﬂow has a deﬁned direction within each column and reverses between

neighboring columns. It corresponds to the geometry sketched in ﬁgure 1(a). Figure 1(c)

and (d) show respectively a cut of the ﬂow in the planes z = 0 and θ = 0. The helicity

(H = V · (∇ × V)) has the same sign in each column, negative in this case (a column with

positive axial velocity rotates with negative vorticity). The corresponding poloidal velocity

is given by:

VA

In the second case (sketched in ﬁgure 1(b)), the axial ﬂow is reversed about the plane z = 0,

hence having symmetries similar to Busse’s columns in rotating convection. Figure 1(e)

shows a cut of the ﬂow in the plane θ = 0. The helicity is therefore negative in the columns

of the upper half of the cylinder and positive in the lower half. The axial velocity is then

written:

In our study, we call T 1

2 the conﬁguration obtained with the rotational velocity and the
ﬁrst choice of the axial velocity ﬁeld, and T 1 the conﬁguration obtained with the second

choice. We shall look for stationary solutions of the induction equation:

∂tB = 0 = ∇ × (V × B) + η∆B ,

where η is the magnetic diﬀusivity of the ﬂuid. The boundary conditions are such that

the medium inside the annulus has the same electrical conductivity as the ﬂuid while the

outside medium is insulating. The magnetic permeability is equal to that of vacuum in the

whole space.

We stress that once the radius R of the cylinder and the aspect ratio H/R = 2 are

ﬁxed there are still many independent parameters which may be varied: the number 2n of

columns, their aspect ratio d/R, the magnitude of the axial ﬂow compared to the rotational

one, etc. We shall concentrate on the geometry portrayed in ﬁgure 1: four pairs of columns

with relative thickness equal to 0.4 (yielding a square aspect ratio for the columns), and

ξ = 1.25 (this sets the ratio of the maxima of axial to rotational velocities to 0.7, close

to the values in the existing experimental dynamos [14, 15, 23]). The only remaining free

parameter is the amplitude of the velocity ﬁeld, which is non-dimensionalized in the form

of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm = VmaxR/η. Vmax is the maximum velocity in the

domain of the ﬂow, and we write V = Vmaxv.

B.

Iterative procedure

We use here the iterative technique introduced in [16, 17]. The reader is referred to it

for a detailed presentation, and for an evaluation of its performance compared to standard

analysis in magnetohydrodynamics, such as the linear stability analysis of the induction

equation. We stress that the technique is best suited for the study of stationary solutions,

and only recall here its basic principles.

We consider the response of the ﬂow to an applied magnetic ﬁeld B0, looking for the

induced ﬁeld B which solves the stationary induction equation

∇ × (V × B) + η∆B = −∇ × (V × B0) .

The result is expressed as the integer series

B =

Bk with |Bk| ∼ O(Rk

m)B0 ,

(cid:88)

equations

∆Bk+1 = −Rm∇ × (v × Bk) ,

k ≥ 0

which can be solved for any given set of boundary conditions.

The contributions Bk are computed iteratively from a hierarchy of non-dimensional Poisson

(6)

C. Numerical simulation

Applying a standard Poisson solver to equation (8) would require to write the complete

set of conditions for the magnetic ﬁeld at the boundaries of the computational domain. In

practice, the boundary conditions are more readily expressed in terms of electric currents

and potentials. We thus implement the following sequence:

(i) The electromotive force (e.m.f. in units of VmaxB0) induced by the ﬂow motion is com-

puted from ek+1 = v × Bk.

(ii) Electric current being divergence free, the distribution of electric potential is obtained

from ∆φk+1 = ∇ · (v × Bk), with von Neuman boundary conditions (n · ∇φ = n · (v × B),

with n the outgoing normal of the domain).

(iii) Induced currents (non-dimensionalized) are then computed as from Ohm’s law

jk+1 = −∇φk+1 + ek+1, and used to compute the magnetic ﬁeld Bk+1 from Biot and Savart

law.

All calculations are made with a magnetic Reynolds number equal to unity (we set R = 1,

Vmax = 1 and η = 1). Its actual value enters only in the ﬁnal step, when contributions are
collected and the integer series is computed: B(Rm) = (cid:80)
m. This approach
requires that the series converges, and sets an upper value for the magnetic Reynolds num-

k Bk(Rm = 1)Rk

ber Rm (Rm < R∗

m). We have found that the radius of convergence Rm
of 30; for higher magnetic Reynolds number values we have shown in [16] that Pad´e ap-

∗ is of the order

proximants [18] still give results in remarkable agreement with the solution of the induction

equation computed without approximation.

INDUCTION PROCESSES.

A.

Induction from a toroidal applied ﬁeld.

When an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied in the azimuthal direction (B0 = B0eθ), one

expects the generation of an azimuthal current, in very much the same manner as the α

eﬀect [19] operates in the Roberts ﬂow [13] and in the Karlsruhe dynamo [14, 27]. This is

because there is no conceptual diﬀerence between a horizontal ﬁeld transverse to the columns

in the Karlsruhe geometry and a toroidal ﬁeld applied in the geometry considered here. In

6

the azimuthal direction, there is a scale separation between the size of one column and the

circumference of the annulus, so the results of mean-ﬁeld MHD, as for instance explored

in [20], should apply.

1.

Induction at ﬁrst order

We start with induction at ﬁrst-order, i.e. the solution of the ﬁrst iterative step of the

The topology of B0 is chosen identical to the one that would be generated by the ﬂow of

an electric current in a rod of radius a located along the z-axis

The induced ﬁeld B1 is shown in ﬁgure 2(a) and (b). One observes two major eﬀects:

in

the axial direction the ﬁeld lines are stretched by the vertical velocity gradients, and in the

transverse plane they are advected by the rotational motion in the columns. The mechanisms

are schematically shown in ﬁgure 2(c) and (d); B1,z (ﬁgure 2(c)) results from the action of

the axial ﬂow, as can be seen by writing the axial projection of equation (9):

∆B1,z = −B0

Note that since the stretching is largest at the boundary between two columns, the induced

ﬁeld is also maximum at these points, therefore out of phase by a quarter of a period with

respect to the velocity ﬁeld.

However, the picture is simpler when restricted to induction in the z = 0 plane. In this case

the last two terms of the above equation do not contribute because vA is an odd function

with respect to z. In particular, one obtains for the ﬁeld induced in the radial direction

which shows that (i) the stretching by the azimuthal gradient of vR

θ is compensated by the
advection of the applied ﬁeld; (ii) the net eﬀect is due to the azimuthal modulation of the

radial ﬂow (ﬁgure 2(d)). At ﬁrst order, the rotational ﬂow component generates in the

center of the columns an induced ﬁeld perpendicular to the applied one, a mechanism which

is quite helpful in the understanding of ﬁeld expulsion by vortices.

2. Second order eﬀects

We now turn to the analysis of the induction at second order of iteration, i.e.

the

induction resulting from the presence of B1. The electromotive force e2 = v × B1 is shown

in ﬁgure 3(a,b). At this stage, the induction from each column add-up cooperatively. An

azimuthal current J2,θ is induced – ﬁgure 3(b) – parallel to the applied ﬁeld B0.

It has

the symmetry of the ﬂow helicity. As we have veriﬁed, it is reversed as either vA or vR

is reversed but not when both change sign. J2,θ generates the axial ﬁeld B2,z shown in

ﬁgure 3(c). This induction by helical motion, schematized in ﬁgure 3(e), was ﬁrst proposed

by Parker [21], and evidenced in the VKS experiment [22]. It is also in agreement with the

α eﬀect introduced in the framework of mean-ﬁeld magnetohydrodynamics [19], for the 2D

array of columns in the Roberts ﬂow [13], and for the columnar ring discussed here [20].

Following this analogy, we will call this eﬀect α-eﬀect in the rest of our study.

The electromotive force e2 also generates axial currents which create the azimuthal ﬁeld

B2,θ shown in ﬁgure 3(d): it is largest in the center of the columns and its direction is opposed

to the applied ﬁeld. Its generation – schematized in 3(f) – shows that B2,θ is opposed to

the applied ﬁeld even when the rotation of the columns is reversed, or when the axial ﬂow is

reversed or even suppressed. The eﬀect traces back to the expulsion of magnetic ﬁeld lines

by vortical motions, as shown by numerical [24] and experimental [25] studies on an isolated

vortex. It is a second order eﬀect: as pointed out previously, the rotational motion of the

column can be thought of as turning the applied ﬁeld lines by 90 degrees at each step, so

that after two iterations the induced ﬁeld is directly opposite to the applied one.

We stress that the response of the ﬂow to an applied ﬁeld is more complex than the

generation of an azimuthal current J2,θ by an ‘α’ eﬀect due to the helical motion in the

columns; this eﬀect is indeed present, but the net current J2 is related to the applied ﬁeld

by a full second rank tensor, J2 = σ[α]B0. In the tensor [α] not all components are due to

8

the ﬂow helicity and some components correspond to an expulsion eﬀect.

3. Azimuthal averages

In the remaining of our study, we consider the contributions to the induction averaged

over the azimuthal angle θ, as they present a somewhat clearer picture. Figure 4 shows the

averaged order 2 ﬁeld, deﬁned as:

(cid:104)B2(cid:105)(r, z) ≡

dθ B2(r, θ, z)

(14)

1
2π

(cid:90) 2π

0

One clearly sees the induced azimuthal current (cid:104)J2,θ(cid:105) and the associated magnetic ﬁeld with

a dipolar structure.

In a ﬁnite geometry with insulating surroundings, the currents (cid:104)J2(cid:105)

must remain within the ﬂow volume, leading to poloidal current loops (arrows in 4(a))

which participate to the expulsion of the applied ﬁeld.

In order to quantify the importance of each eﬀect, we have plotted in ﬁgure 5 the evolution

of the components of (cid:104)B2(cid:105) with the radial and axial positions. We observe in ﬁgure 5(a) that

the dipolar ﬁeld (cid:104)B2,z(cid:105) is about twice as large as the component (cid:104)B2,θ(cid:105) of ﬁeld expulsion. In

ﬁgure 5(b), the induction is maximum in the mid-plane z = 0, save for the (cid:104)B2,r(cid:105) component

for which the top and bottom boundary conditions play a major role.

4. Higher orders

As detailed in [16], the interest of the iterative procedure is to associate induction eﬀects

with speciﬁc actions of velocity gradients.

It is particularly convenient when a patterns

develops through the iterations. As it is the case here, we deﬁne a tool to help us quantify

the convergence of the pattern. Let Bj and Bk be the ﬁelds induced at respective orders j

and k. We compute the scalar product

and the associated norm N (Bk) = (cid:112)(Bk|Bk). Comparisons are made using the normalized
scalar product

In the case of an azimuthal applied ﬁeld, the expulsion eventually dominates. To wit, we

compare in ﬁgure 6 the induced ﬁelds at order 1 and 3, and successive iterations of the axial

ﬁeld (cid:104)B2k(cid:105). One ﬁnds P1,3 ∼ −0.9, while P2,3 ∼ 0: the ﬁeld induced at third order is almost

exactly opposed to B1 and perpendicular to B2. As a result, the successive induction steps

lead to the expulsion of the applied ﬁeld, with Pk,k+1 ∼ 0 and Pk,k+2 ∼ −1, at higher orders.

Bear in mind that this concerns normalized values. In dimensional units, one has :

Bk+2 ∼ γBk

, with γ ∼ −1/400

(17)

After the 10th order, we could not detect any appreciable evolution of the pattern.

5. Evolution with Rm

The magnetic Reynolds number is re-introduced in the summation Bind = (cid:80)∞

mBk.
We have used the summed terms up to order 22, resulting in a 1% accuracy. We show in

k=1 Rk

ﬁgure 7 the evolution with Rm of two components of the induction: the axial ﬁeld in the

center of the cylinder, and the toroidal ﬁeld in the center of the columns. For Rm ≤ 8,

the calculation at second order yields a very good approximation of the net induction.

This is interesting because the 2nd order truncation corresponds to the computation of the

mean-ﬁeld theory with a ﬁrst order smoothing approximation [20]. For magnetic Reynolds

numbers greater than about 8, the contributions of higher orders in the summation need to

be taken into account. One ﬁnds that the mean-ﬁeld approximation tends to over-estimate

the induced dipole ﬁeld – ﬁgure 7(a), as well as the expulsion of the toroidal ﬁeld – ﬁgure 7(b).

Empirically, we observe that the radius of convergence of the integer series is R∗

m = 17.
This value can be understood from our observation that Pk,k+1 ∼ 0 and Bk+2 ∼ γBk. Indeed

one can then rewrite the summation as

B = (RmB1 + R2

mB2)

(−|γ|R2

m)k ,

∞
(cid:88)

k=0

from which one immediately gets 1/(cid:112)|γ| ∼ 20 for the radius of convergence. In addition,
for Rm < R∗

m, one gets:

B (cid:39)

Rm
1 + |γ|R2
m

B1 +

R2
m
1 + |γ|R2
m

B2 ,

which shows that the divergence of the integer series actually lies in the existence of imagi-

nary roots. Such a conﬁgurations is particularly suited to the use of Pad´e approximants [18].

(18)

(19)

10

The result, plotted as a solid line in ﬁgure 7, shows that at large magnetic Reynolds numbers

(Rm ≥ 40) the axial induction and the expulsion may saturate.

B.

Induction from a radial ﬁeld applied

As detailed above, starting from an applied toroidal ﬁeld, the α-eﬀect generates a poloidal

induced ﬁeld with a large axial component, but it is easy to show that this axial component

gives in turn very weak contributions to the induction. Indeed, an applied ﬁeld in the axial

direction induces ﬁelds that are two orders of magnitude weaker than the values obtained

with other orientations. In contrast, we show in this section that a radially applied ﬁeld

generates an induced ﬁeld which has a signiﬁcant component in the azimuthal direction.

Speciﬁcally, we consider an applied ﬁeld B0 of the form

B0 = B0






r
a
a
r

er

er

(r ≤ a = 0.1)

(a ≤ r)

(20)

Two remarks about this functional form are in order:

(i) within the domain of resolution of the induction equation it is essential that B0 be

divergence free because we solve iteratively ∆Bk+1 = −∇ × (v × Bk) rather than ∆Bk+1 =

(ii) here, B0 is not divergence free for r ≤ a, but in this domain the source term in

−v · ∇Bk − Bk · ∇v.

∆B1 = −∇ × (v × B0) vanishes with v.

1.

Induction at ﬁrst order

The induced ﬁeld at ﬁrst order is shown in ﬁgure 8. We observe in (a) and (b) that

the magnetic induction is in phase with the ﬂow in the columns, as opposed to the case

of a toroidal applied ﬁeld, where there was a phase diﬀerence of a quarter of a period.

In the transverse plane, the eﬀect of the azimuthal part of the velocity ﬁeld is to twist

the applied ﬁeld lines, thereby generating azimuthal components in the magnetic ﬁeld, in

direct correspondence with the case of an azimuthal applied ﬁeld, shown in ﬁgure 2(d). The

magnetic ﬁeld induced in the axial direction is due to the radial gradient of the vertical

velocity and solves ∆B1,z = −B0(a/r)∂rvA

z . It corresponds to the stretching of applied ﬁeld
lines in the vertical direction. However, it is can be seen in ﬁgure 8(a,c) that the induction

11

lies essentially near the boundary with the inner core (r ∼ 0.6) compared to the boundary

with the outer medium (r ∼ 1). Since at both location there exists a large radial gradient

in the vertical velocity, the diﬀerence has to be linked with the electromagnetic boundary

conditions. The inner core has the same conductivity as the ﬂuid while the outer medium is

insulating, so that the magnetic ﬁeld is potential outside the cylinder. For a z-independent

ﬂow, one can show that this condition ensures that the induced ﬁeld Bz vanishes at the

r = 1 boundary [26]. In the case of our ﬂow, the velocity ﬁeld is not z-independent but its

components have only second order variation with z in the mid-plane. One thus understands

why the induction in the axial direction is so weak at r = 1, as shown in ﬁgures 8(a,c).

2.

Induction at second order

As can be expected, in correspondence to the induction in the case of an azimuthal applied

ﬁeld, the screw motion in the columns produces again a current parallel to the applied ﬁeld.

This is shown in ﬁgure 9(b) where one ﬁnds an induced radial e.m.f. maximum in the center

of each column. This electromotive force has the symmetry of the helicity, reversing if either

vA or vP are reversed (but not both simultaneously). The corresponding induced currents

generate the axial ﬁeld B2,z shown in ﬁgure 9(c). The ﬁeld is periodic in the azimuthal

direction with a period equal to half the period of the column distribution – in agreement

with the Parker induction mechanism sketched in ﬁgure 3.e (vertical arrows).

When one computes the azimuthal average, a ﬁrst observation is that the currents yield

a non zero contribution (cid:104)J2(cid:105) which is essentially radial in the mid-plane z = 0. In addition

the current lines close inside the conducting ﬂuid, leading to the poloidal loops shown in

ﬁgure 9(e). They generate a ﬁeld (cid:104)B2(cid:105) whose toroidal part is anti-symmetric about the z = 0

plane, as shown in ﬁgure 9(f).

One thus ﬁnds that a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld is generated from the application of a radial

magnetic ﬁeld. The conversion is less eﬃcient than the reverse process, discussed in the

previous section. One computes max{(cid:104)B2,θ(cid:105)/B0,r} ∼ 7 · 10−4 instead of max{(cid:104)B2,r(cid:105)/B0,θ} ∼
11 · 10−4. However, the major beneﬁt is that the expulsion is much weaker. The component

of (cid:104)B2(cid:105) opposed to the applied radial ﬁeld is 10 times weaker than the induced toroidal

ﬁeld. This can be explained by the fact that, while B2 has a component opposed to the

applied ﬁeld in the center of the columns, it has a contribution which reinforces the applied

12

ﬁeld in their periphery as can be seen in ﬁgure 9(d). Therefore, when the azimuthal average

is taken, the expulsion eﬀect is weakened. On the contrary, in the case of the azimuthal

applied ﬁeld, the expulsion eﬀect from each columns add up collectively (see ﬁgure 3(b)),

resulting in a larger contribution.

Hence, expulsion is less eﬀective in the direction perpendicular to the direction where

scale separation develops (in the azimuthal direction the columns cross-section is an order of

magnitude smaller than the cylinder diameter, while in the radial direction the characteristic

size of the ﬂow is equal to the width of the column). We conclude that in the case consid-

ered here, scale separation does not particularly favor magnetic induction, but dramatically

reduces expulsion.

3. Higher orders

The structure of the induced magnetic ﬁeld is rapidly stabilized as higher orders are

computed. As shown in ﬁgure 10 the ﬁelds at orders 3 and 5 closely resembles that at order

1; the normalized scalar product are P1,3 ∼ −0.5 and P3,5 ∼ −0.9.

The ﬁelds produced at a given order are again fairly orthogonal to the ﬁelds at next or

previous order : (Bk|Bk+1) ∼ 0. In addition, as can be seen in ﬁgure 10(g), the iteration

converges for even orders towards a quadrupolar structure with a negative feed-back in a

Bk+2 = −γBk

(γ ∼ 1/415) .

two step mechanism:

4. Evolution with Rm

The Rm dependence of the induced radial and azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld is shown in

ﬁgure 11, after summation of the terms up to order 22. Note that Bθ is sampled at (r =

0.7, z = −0.6), because for a quadrupole, the toroidal ﬁeld is very small in the z = 0 plane.

One observes in ﬁgure 11(b) that a second order calculation is a correct approximation for

magnetic Reynolds numbers up to 10. For higher Rm other terms need to be included. As

in the case of the toroidal applied ﬁeld, they tend to slow the increase of the induced ﬁeld,

mainly because of expulsion generated from rotational motion in the columns. The integer
m = 18, as expected from the value 1/(cid:112)|γ| ∼ 20. Results obtained using

series diverges for R∗

13

the Pad´e approximants, although extending the computed induction beyond the radius of

convergence of the series, do not point to a saturation at large Rm.

IV. DYNAMO ACTION

In the previous section, we showed that the induction mechanisms in the case of the

T 1

2 ﬂow consist in a mutual conversion between azimuthal and radial ﬁelds, through the
α eﬀect, along with an eﬀect of expulsion of these ﬁelds by the rotating columns. We

have identiﬁed two modes, dipole and quadrupole, mainly axisymmetric, that realize a

feed-back loop in a two-step mechanism (equations (17) and (21)) with a negative sign,

therefore leading to an anti-dynamo conﬁguration. Following the ideas developed in [16],

we can express these results using an induction operator formalism: from equation (8), we

deﬁne L(Rm) ≡ −Rm∆−1 {∇ × (v × •)} for a velocity ﬁeld v corresponding to the value

Rm = 1. Equations (17) and (21) can then be interpreted in the following way: the (cid:104)B2n(cid:105)

modes (n > 5) obtained in the induction studies in section III A (dipole mode) and III B

(quadrupole mode) are eigenvectors of L2(Rm). From this observation, we will show in this

section that using a poloidal/toroidal decomposition, a matrix analysis can be performed

on the identiﬁed eigenmodes to ﬁnd eigenvectors of L2(Rm) with positive eigenvalues, thus

leading to possible dynamo solutions.

Indeed, writing for simplicity L = L(1) (we then have L(Rm)B = RmLB), let’s assume

that we can ﬁnd a magnetic ﬁeld Be that is not an eigenvector of the operator L, but
of L2 with a positive eigenvalue γe. We can easily show that Bs = Be + 1√
γe

LBe is an

eigenvector of L with a positive eigenvalue γs =

γe. Taking Rm = 1/

γe, we then have

√

√

L(Rm)Bs = Bs, which deﬁnes Bs as a self-sustained magnetic ﬁeld by the velocity ﬁeld, at

threshold Rm = 1/

γe.

A. Dynamo action in the T 1

2 ﬂow.

A dynamo cycle is often seen as a toroidal/poloidal feed-back loop [11]. In the cylindrical

geometry of the T 1

2 ﬂow, it is easy to decompose an axisymmetric ﬁeld into its poloidal and
toroidal part. We perform such a decomposition successively on the dipole and quadrupole

axisymmetric eigenmodes of the L2 operator and then compute the action of this operator on

14

the vector space generated by these two components. This leads us to a matrix formulation

of the problem, allowing the identiﬁcation of dynamo modes. We then perform the same

analysis on a non axisymmetric mode.

1. Generation of a dipole ﬁeld.

We start from the ﬁeld (cid:104)B10(cid:105) – ﬁgure 6(e) – which was shown (equation (17)) to be an

eigenvector of L2, with a dipolar geometry and a negative eigenvalue. Figure 12(a) and (c)

show the decomposition of this ﬁeld into its toroidal – BT

d – and poloidal – BP

Figure 12(b) and (d) show the axisymmetric part of the ﬁelds L2BT

their topology are very similar and look like a linear combination of the initial ﬁelds BT

onto the initial ﬁelds, thus deﬁning an induction matrix:

We have assumed so far that (cid:104)L2BT

d (cid:105) belong to the vector space generated by
d . In order to check the validity of this hypothesis, we show some comparisons in
ﬁgure 13, using proﬁles normalized by their maximum value: in (a) the axial proﬁles of the

d (cid:105) and (cid:104)L2BP

d and BP

BT

radial component of (cid:104)L2BT

d . One
can see that the overlap is very good. In (b), the radial proﬁles of the azimuthal component

d (cid:105) are compared to the equivalent proﬁle for BP

d (cid:105) and (cid:104)L2BP

of (cid:104)L2BT

d (cid:105) and (cid:104)L2BP

d (cid:105) are compared to the radial proﬁle for BT

d . In the case of the α-eﬀect
d (cid:105) proﬁle), the overlap is very good again. In the case of the expulsion eﬀect ((cid:104)L2BT
d (cid:105)
proﬁle), there is a discrepancy. We have computed the error to be about 10%. Thus the

((cid:104)L2BP

MT T term in the matrix represents the expulsion mechanism for the applied toroidal ﬁeld

within an error of 10 %, while the other elements of the matrix can be considered as correct

within less than 1 %.

2. Generation of a quadrupole ﬁeld.

We follow the same procedure as for the dipole case. We start from (cid:104)B10(cid:105) presented in

ﬁgure 10(g), which was shown (equation (21)) to be an eigenvector of the operator L2, with

a quadrupolar geometry and a negative eigenvalue. This mode is orthogonal to the dipole

BP

mode used in the previous section. We split this ﬁeld into its toroidal – BT

q – and poloidal –
q – components (ﬁgure 14(a) and (c)). Figures 14(b) and (d) show the axisymmetric part
q . Again, the resulting ﬁelds are of opposite sign with respect to
q and have very similar topology. We deﬁne the matrix M as in the dipole case,

of the ﬁelds L2BT

error of about 10%.

3. Transverse dipole.

Until now, we have only considered axisymmetric ﬁelds. However, since the T 1

2 ﬂow
presents several analogies with the Roberts ﬂow, it would be interesting to study the possi-

bility of generating a transverse dipole (perpendicular to the columns), as observed in the

Karlsruhe dynamo [14]. We follow the same strategy as before: a uniform transverse ﬁeld

B0 = B0ex is applied to the ﬂow and we compute the ﬁelds Bk obtained after k iterations.
They rapidly converge towards a stable structure. After 8 iterations, the ﬁelds Bk and L2Bk

have an overlap close to 100%, and the eigenvalue is negative, γ = −1/400. Figure 15 shows

two cuts of the ﬁeld B8.

In order to use the same matrix analysis as in the axisymmetric cases, one must ﬁnd a

way to decompose B8 into a couple of vectors generating a subspace closed under L2. No

poloidal/toroidal decomposition can be made here since the mode is not axisymmetric, but

symmetry considerations can be used, based on the following observation: in section IV A 1

and IV A 2 the toroidal/poloidal decomposition of the eigenvector also resulted in separating

the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the eigenvector under the reﬂection symmetry

with respect to the plane z = 0. In what follows, we will call Sz this symmetry. One can

then notice in ﬁgure 15 that the x component of the ﬁeld is symmetric under Sz, while the y

component is antisymmetric. The system being ﬁnite and the exterior being insulating, the

x and y components are each associated to an axial component having the same symmetry:

Bx, symmetric with respect to Sz, is associated with a symmetric axial component, Bs

z; By,

17

antisymmetric, is associated with the antisymmetric part of the axial component, Ba

z . We
z ez as the generating vectors.
Applying L2 to these vectors, one observes that, in this case too, the resulting vectors

thus deﬁne the vectors B0

x = Bxex + Bs

y = Byey + Ba

zez and B0

can be expressed as linear combinations of B0

x and B0

y. L2 can therefore be expressed in this

basis as the matrix :

Mt(T 1

2) = −10−4









15 13

20 14

(27)

This matrix has a positive eigenvalue λ+

2 ﬂow is also
able to sustain a transverse dipole, with a threshold equal to 79, very close to the one of the

t = 1.6 10−4, showing that the T 1

axial quadrupole.

In a T 1

2 ﬂow, we thus observed that several dynamo modes can be sustained when Rm (cid:39)
80. This result is consistent with other numerical studies in thermal convection [29], which

have shown that various dynamo solutions can coexist in the same region of the parameter

space. This kind of behavior has also been observed in the VKS dynamo experiment [35].

B. Dynamo mechanisms in the T 1 ﬂow.

1. Symmetry considerations.

The analytical expression of the T 1 ﬂow is given in equation (4). Compared to the T 1
2
ﬂow (equation (3)), the only diﬀerence is that the azimuthal and axial components are now

respectively symmetric and antisymmetric under Sz. T 1 is a superposition of two T 1

2 ﬂows,
one in each half-cylinder, symmetric with respect to Sz. They have opposite helicity, since

their axial component is reversed, while the rotation of the columns is unchanged. The

strong similarity between the T 1

2 and T 1 ﬂows indicates that the same mechanisms, α eﬀect
and expulsion, will take place. Figure 16 compares the schematic induction mechanisms for

the α eﬀect in both types of ﬂow. In (a), the case of the T 1

2 ﬂow is recalled, where the
induced current (j = σαB) is parallel to the applied ﬁeld with the same sign, since helicity

H is negative in this ﬂow and the α coeﬃcient is proportional to −H. In (b), it is shown

that in the T 1 ﬂow, applying a symmetric toroidal ﬁeld results in a symmetric poloidal

ﬁeld, corresponding to a quadrupolar geometry. In (c), we show that the dipolar geometry

18

(antisymmetric poloidal ﬁeld) is obtained by applying an antisymmetric toroidal ﬁeld.

2. Search of axisymmetric dynamo modes.

Dipolar mode:

The symmetry considerations of the previous paragraph suggest that a dipolar mode

can be obtained in the T 1 ﬂow by an iterative application of L to an initial toroidal ﬁeld

antisymmetric with respect to Sz. We chose an initial ﬁeld of the form B0 = B0 sin(π z

H )eθ.
The iterations converge rapidly towards a mode whose toroidal and poloidal parts, once

the azimuthal average is done, form a basis which is closed under the action of L2. The

corresponding matrix is:

Md(T 1) = −10−4









13 16

8 12

It has two negative eigenvalues λd

2 = −1.2 10−4, so that with the
current parameters (d/r = 0.4, ξ = 1.25 and n = 4), the T 1 ﬂow is unable to sustain an

1 = −24 10−4 and λd

axial dipole dynamo mode.

Quadrupolar mode:

In this case, the symmetry study shows that the initial azimuthal ﬁeld must be symmetric

under Sz. Two choices can be tested: an azimuthal z-independent ﬁeld or a radial ﬁeld

of the form B0 = B0

a
r cos(πz/H)er. In both cases the iterations converge towards ﬁelds
with identical structures. As previously, the toroidal and poloidal components of the ﬁeld

obtained after 10 iterations deﬁne the basis for the quadrupole vector space. In this basis,

the expression of L2 is:

(28)

(29)

Again this matrix has two negative eigenvalues λq

1 = −20.10−4 and λq

2 = −0.2.10−4.

Mq(T 1) = −10−4





11 11

9.1 9.4





19

It is interesting to note that in all the cases where a dynamo was possible, the

corresponding matrix (Md(T 1

2)) presented the characteristics that
2) and Mt(T 1
the product of the non-diagonal terms was larger than the product of the diagonal

2), Mq(T 1

terms. One can easily show that this is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a 2×2

matrix with negative diagonal coeﬃcients in order to have a positive eigenvalue. And

this condition physically corresponds to the facts that the expulsion mechanism (diagonal

terms) is weaker than the α mechanism (non-diagonal terms). On the contrary, in the

case of (Md(T 1)) and (Mq(T 1)), this condition is not met. In the quadrupolar case, both
products are very close, resulting in a small value for |λq
2| (close to 10−5). We can therefore
expect that by increasing the ξ parameter (reducing the rotational component of the ﬂow,

responsible for the expulsion eﬀect), a quadrupolar dynamo could be observed in the T 1 ﬂow.

Transverse mode:

In the case of the T 1

2 ﬂow, we have iterated the L operator starting from a uniform
transverse ﬁeld and then deﬁned the basis vectors using as a criterion the behavior of the

cartesian components of the converged mode under the Sz symmetry. We tried to follow

the same procedure in the case of the T 1 ﬂow, but it turned out that the converged mode

is formed of two dipolar structures at 90 degrees from each other, having the same behavior

with respect to the Sz symmetry. Therefore, it is not possible to use this symmetry to

construct the basis vectors. And indeed, we were not able to ﬁnd any basis that would be

closed under the action of L2. This shows a limit of our method.

C. Generalization for other values of the poloidal/toroidal ratio.

1. General expression for the matrix M .

Until now, all our studies have been based on the same ﬂow parameters (d/r = 0.4,

ξ = 1.25 and n = 4). As we noticed in section IV B 2 that a change in the axial/rotational

ratio (ξ parameter) might allow the T 1 ﬂow to sustain a quadrupolar dynamo, we redeﬁne

the L operator as a linear function of the poloidal and toroidal components of the ﬂow. We

normalize the components vA and vR of the velocity ﬁeld: max(vA) = 1 and max(vR) = 1

20

and rewrite equation (1) as V = VAvA + VRvR where VA and VR represent the maximum
amplitude of each component. Let LA be the induction operator when V = vA and LR be
the induction operator when V = vR; L can then be written as the linear combination:

yielding:

L = VALA + VRLR ,

L2 = V 2

ALALA + VAVR(LRLA + LALR) + V 2

RLRLR ,

so that the 4 matrix elements Mij can also be written as quadratic forms of VA and VR:

Mij = aijV 2

A + bijVRVA + cijV 2
R.

As we studied the induction mechanisms, we noticed that the α eﬀect and the expulsion

behave diﬀerently under a reversal of the axial pumping (VA → −VA) or of the columns

rotation (VR → −VR). More precisely, it was observed that the expulsion eﬀect is indepen-

dent of these sign changes, whereas the α eﬀect transforms as the product VAVR. These

observations allow to eliminate some terms in equation (32), yielding:

M (VR, VA) =

2. Positive eigenvalue diagram for the T 1

In the case of the T 1

2 ﬂow, the value of these 6 coeﬃcients are computed using successively
the dipole basis, the quadrupole basis and the transverse basis obtained respectively in

sections IV A 1,

IV A 2 and IV A 3. The corresponding expressions for the matrix M are

(36)

From these expressions, the largest eigenvalue λmax of each matrix can be computed as a

function of VA and VR. The result is shown in ﬁgure 17. In order to facilitate the reading of

these plots, when λmax was negative (no dynamo), we artiﬁcially set its value to zero. For

each case, two regions are evidenced: the ﬁrst one, for which λmax > 0, corresponds to the

possibility to observe a dynamo for the considered geometric parameters ( d/r = 0.4 and

n = 4) with a threshold Rc

m = 1/

λmax. The second, for which λmax < 0, corresponds to

the case where no dynamo instability can take place. Figures (a), (b) and (c) show that the

√

three dynamo modes coexist in the same region, in the neighborhood of the line VA = VR.

This is not surprising, since when one of the velocity component dominates the other, the

expulsion mechanism is more important than the α eﬀect, which needs both components

together.

For a given couple (VA, VR), one can observe that λq is always larger than λd (corre-

sponding to a lower threshold). In the same way, the transverse dipole always has a lower

threshold than the axial dipole. A summary of the predominance of the diﬀerent modes is

given in ﬁgure 17(d), where one can see that the transverse dipole is favored by higher ratio

axial/rotational, whereas the quadrupole is favored by a lower ratio.

3. Positive eigenvalue diagram for the T 1 ﬂow.

We performed the same analysis for the T 1 ﬂow. The matrix M has the following ex-

pressions:

(38)

Figure 18 shows the evolution of λmax in the case of the quadrupole mode. It conﬁrms the

assumption made in section IV B 2, namely that starting from the value ξ = 1.25 studied

in that section (cross in ﬁgure 18), one could evolve the system towards a dynamo state

by reducing the intensity of the rotation (increasing ξ, corresponding in ﬁgure 18 to a

displacement towards the top left corner).

On the other hand, there is no value of the couple (VA, VR) for which the axial dipole can

be sustained by the T 1 ﬂow. Some studies have shown [31] that in order for a T 1-type ﬂow

to sustain an axial dipole, the presence of diﬀerential rotation, absent in our study, would

be necessary.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS.

A better understanding of the MHD induction mechanisms in a given system can

help to build dynamo cycles.

In the ﬁrst part of this study, we have identiﬁed two

mechanisms, related respectively to the α-eﬀect and to expulsion by vortices. We expressed

these mechanisms in terms of the induction operator L2 and, using a poloidal/toroidal

decomposition of the eigenvectors of L2, we were able to perform a matrix analysis

leading to the determination of self-sustained magnetic modes. The beneﬁt is to give a

complete description of the modes whose interaction lead to dynamo action.

In regards

to natural or experimental conditions, it helps understand which features of the velocity

ﬁeld favor or hinder dynamo action. In addition, as already noticed in other studies [28],

the competition between the α-eﬀect, favorable to the dynamo, and the expulsion eﬀect,

that works against it, can be monitored by the ratio of poloidal to toroidal components

of the velocity ﬁeld (in our case the axial to rotational ratio VA/VR). Our studies show

that a positive feed-back requires a comparable amplitude for rotation and pumping.

In

the case of the T 1

2 ﬂow (for 8 columns and an aspect ratio of 0.4), we observed that both
axisymmetric modes (dipolar and quadrupolar) can be sustained, with a threshold of the

order of Rm = 100. We also showed that a transverse dipole mode can exist, as one

could expect, because of the analogy between our ﬂow and the Karlsruhe dynamo. On

23

the other hand, the T 1 ﬂow can only sustain a quadrupolar mode, when the pumping

amplitude is larger than the rotation amplitude. For the axial dipole mode, the poloidal to

toroidal conversion seems too weak to compensate the strong expulsion of the azimuthal ﬁeld.

Coming back to the Earth’s case, our model system leads to several observations

which may be relevant. An α2 dynamo process relies on the helicity contained in Busse’s

columns [4], but Eckman pumping would give a very weak source of axial motion, since the

Eckman number E is of the order of 10−15 and the ratio of the axial ﬂow to the rotational

ﬂow scales like E1/2 [30]. Another source of axial velocity could be by the β-eﬀect due

to the curvature of the core-mantle boundary – note that in this case the axial ﬂow is in

phase with the radial ﬂow rather than with the vorticity [31]. A large scale dipole ﬁeld

could also be generated from an α − ω dynamo.

It would require diﬀerential rotation

as provided, for instance, by zonal winds [33, 34] or super-rotation eﬀects as observed

in a recent laboratory experiment [32] These ingredients could in principle be added

to the model studied here, and the procedure used to determine which dynamo modes

(dipole, quadrupole or other) are likely to exist for a given range of Reynolds numbers. As

proposed for geomagnetism [36], and recently observed in the VKS experiment [35], the

close proximity of dynamo modes may be essential for the development of dynamical regimes.

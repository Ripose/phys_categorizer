We investigate quasi-two-dimensional relaxation, by surface tension, of a long straight stripe of
inviscid ﬂuid trapped inside a viscous ﬂuid in a Hele-Shaw cell. Combining analytical and numerical
solutions, we describe the emergence of a self-similar dumbbell shape and ﬁnd non-trivial dynamic
exponents that characterize scaling behavior of the dumbbell dimensions.

Introduction. Consider a bubble of low-viscosity ﬂuid
(say, water) trapped inside a high-viscosity ﬂuid (say,
oil) in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell. What
will happen to the shape of the bubble,
if the (hori-
zontal) plates are perfectly smooth, and the ﬂuids are
immiscible? The answer depends on the initial bubble
shape. A perfectly circular bubble (or an inﬁnite straight
stripe) will not change, while a bubble of any other shape
will undergo surface-tension-driven relaxation until it ei-
ther becomes a perfect circle, or breaks into two or more
bubbles, which then become perfect circles. The bubble
shape relaxation is non-local, as it is mediated by a vis-
cous ﬂow in the outer ﬂuid. The resulting free boundary
problem is hard for analysis. This is especially true when
the bubble has a complex (even fractal) shape, like that
observed, in radial geometry, in a strongly forced Hele-
Shaw ﬂow, when the viscous ﬂuid was initially displaced
by the inviscid ﬂuid [1]. The shape complexity results
from the viscous ﬁngering instability [2, 3]. The forced
Hele-Shaw ﬂow is a celebrated problem in ﬂuid dynamics
and nonlinear dynamics [4, 5, 6, 7]. The role of small
surface tension there is to introduce a (nontrivial) reg-
ularization on small scales. This Letter deals with an
unforced Hele-Shaw (UHS) problem, where surface ten-
sion is the only driving mechanism. We address the UHS
problem in the case when the inviscid ﬂuid is initially in
the form of a long stripe. We show that this special initial
condition provides a useful characterization of the UHS
model, as the evolving stripe, which develops a dumbbell
shape, exhibits self-similarity with non-trivial dynamic
exponents.

UHS problem. Let the inner ﬂuid have negligible vis-
cosity, so that the pressure inside the bubble is ho-
mogeneous. The velocity of the viscous outer ﬂuid is
v (r, t) = −(b2/12µ) ∇p (r, t), where p is the pressure,
µ is the dynamic viscosity, and b is the plate spacing
[2, 3, 4, 5]. Therefore, the interface speed is

vn = −(b2/12µ)∇np ,

(1)

where index n denotes the components of the vectors nor-
mal to the interface, and ∇np is evaluated at the respec-
tive points of the interface γ. In view of incompressibility

of the outer ﬂuid, the pressure is a harmonic function:
∇2p = 0 .

(2)

The Gibbs-Thomson relation at the interface yields

p |γ = (π/4) σK ,

(3)

where σ is surface tension, and K is the local curvature of
the interface, positive when the inviscid region is convex
outwards. As both the supply of the inner ﬂuid, and
evacuation of the outer ﬂuid are blocked, we demand

∇np |Γ = 0

(4)

at the external boundary of the system Γ. Equations
[8]
(1)-(4) deﬁne the exterior UHS problem (see Ref.
for a more detailed discussion). A related, but diﬀerent
interior problem has been also considered, mainly in the
context of singularity formation (pinch-oﬀs) in bubbles
of viscous ﬂuid [9]. The UHS model has two important
properties: (i) the bubble area remains constant, (ii) the
length of the interface between the two ﬂuids is a non-
increasing function of time [10].

The UHS problem is not integrable. Moreover, we are
unaware of any analytical solutions to this problem, ex-
cept for a linear analysis of a slightly deformed ﬂat or
circular interface [11]. Owing to its two-dimensionality,
the problem can be reformulated as a nonlocal nonlinear
partial diﬀerential equation for a conformal map which is
analytic in the exterior of the unit circle [12]. This equa-
tion, however, is hard for analysis. We consider here a
simple but non-trivial case that can be analyzed directly
in the physical plane: the dynamics of a half-inﬁnite (or,
physically, very long) stripe.

Stripe dynamics:

theoretical predictions. Let at t =
0 the bubble have the form of a half-inﬁnite straight
stripe of width ∆,
located along the x-axis as shown
in Fig. 1. The external boundary of the system Γ is
at inﬁnity, where the pressure is bounded. We will
measure the distance in units of ∆, the time in units
of τ = 48µ∆3/(πσb2), and the pressure in units of
p0 = πσ/(4∆). In the rescaled variables Eqs. (1) and
(3) become vn = −∇np and p |γ = K, so the rescaled
problem is parameter-free.

This equation yields h(x1, t) in two diﬀerent limits. At

where the last estimate assumes that R(t) is a power of
t. Another limit corresponds to intermediate distances:
R(t) ≪ x1 ≪ L(t) (region II). Here, at ﬁxed x, the main
contribution to the integral in Eq. (7) comes from times
close to t, so that x1(t)/ ˙L(t) ≪ t − t′ ≪ t . Indeed, one
can expand x1(t′) = x1(t) + ˙L(t)(t − t′) + . . . and, in
the leading order, ignore higher order terms. The eﬀec-
tive time interval for the integration is (t − δt′, t), where
δt′ ∼ x1(t)/ ˙L(t). Furthermore, R1/2(t′) can be evaluated
at t′ = t, as its variation on the time interval (t − δt′, t)
is negligible. Then, extending the lower limit of the in-
tegral to −∞ and calculating the remaining elementary
integral, we obtain

Now we can estimate the contributions of regions I and
II to the dumbbell area gain A in the neck region. We
integrate Eq. (8) over x1 from, say, 2L(t) to inﬁnity, and
Eq. (9) from R(t) to 2L(t). The results are:

AI (t) ∼

t
L1/2(t) R1/2(t)

in region I ,

(10)

and

AII (t) ∼

L1/2(t)
˙L(t) R1/2(t)

in region II .

(11)

Once L(t) is a power law, AI and AII are comparable.
Notice that in region I (respectively, II) the main contri-
bution comes from the lower (respectively, upper) limit
of integration. As we verify a posteriori, the contribution
to the dumbbell area of the lobe itself, AR ∼ R2(t), is
negligible compared to AI and AII as long as t ≫ 1.

Now we can ﬁnd the dynamic exponents of L(t) and
R(t). First, we employ the area conservation of the
dumbbell. The area loss L(t) × 1 of the retreating dumb-
bell must be equal to the area gain in the neck, so up to
numerical coeﬃcients of order unity

L(t) ∼ AI (t) ∼ AII (t) ∼

t
L1/2(t) R1/2(t)

.

(12)

Second, there is a simple kinematic relation between ˙L(t)
and the characteristic speed of the lobe motion Vl. Us-
ing Eq. (5), we obtain Vl ∼ −∂p/∂r (r ∼ R(t), φ ≃ π) ∼
R−2(t), and demand ˙L(t) ∼ R−2(t). Combined with
Eq. (12), this yields

L(t) ∼ t3/5 and R(t) ∼ t1/5 at t ≫ 1 .

(13)

FIG. 1: Setting for the dumbbell dynamics.

We are interested in the late-time behavior: t ≫ 1.
Because of the Gibbs-Thomson eﬀect, the pressure gra-
dient is largest near the tip, so the tip retreats along the
x-axis. As the bubble area must be conserved, the re-
treating stripe acquires a dumbbell shape, and the lobe
of the dumbbell expands with time, see Fig. 2. Surpris-
ingly, the main contribution to the dumbbell area comes,
at t ≫ 1, from the dumbbell neck, and not from the lobe.
Going over to a quantitative analysis, we assume (and
later verify numerically) that the lobe can be character-
ized by a single time-dependent length scale R(t). An-
other length scale is L(t): the retreat distance of the
dumbbell. Our main objective is to ﬁnd the exponents
of the power laws for R(t) and L(t). Our analysis will
not give the numerical coeﬃcients of these power laws
(which, in the rescaled units, are of order unity); these
will be found numerically. Introduce polar coordinates
r and φ, see Fig. 1. The dumbbell neck, r ≫ R(t), is
almost ﬂat, so p must vanish at φ → 0 and φ → 2π. On
the other hand, p = K ∼ 1/R(t) at the lobe interface (for
deﬁniteness, at φ = ± π/2). Therefore, the leading term
in the multipole expansion [13] is

p(r, φ, t) = C [R(t) r]

sin(φ/2),

where C = O(1). Having demanded the Gibbs-Thomson
condition here, we somewhat stretched the validity of Eq.
(5), but this can only aﬀect the value of constant C. The
dashed lines in Fig. 1 show the ﬁeld lines of ∇p.

Equation (5) yields the normal component of the inter-
face speed vn = −∇np in the neck region. For the upper
interface of the neck

Now we return to the Cartesian coordinates. Let h(x1, t)
be the local height of the dumbbell, while x1 = x − L(t)
be the horizontal coordinate in the moving frame with
the origin at the tip. In the neck region, x1 ≫ R(t), the
quantity ∂h(x1, t)/∂t is given by Eq. (6), so we obtain

Now we can return to Eqs. (5)-(11) and ﬁnd the explicit
time-dependences. For example, the far-neck asymptote
in Eq. (8) becomes h(x, t) − 1/2 ∼ t9/10x−3/2. We can
also verify that, at t ≫ 1, the lobe area AR ∼ R2(t) ∼
t2/5 is indeed much less than AI (t) ∼ AII (t) ∼ t3/5.

That the lobe is characterized by a single dynamic
length scale R(t) ∼ t1/5 implies a similarity Ansatz for
the lobe shape in the moving frame:

hs(x1, t) = t1/5Φ(x1/t1/5) at t ≫ 1 .

(14)

Numerical method. To test our predictions, we per-
formed simulations of the dynamics of long stripes with
dimensions X × 1, where X ≫ 1. The ultimate shape
of such a stripe is a perfect circle. Therefore, the scaling
behavior, predicted by our theory of a one-sided dumb-
bell, appears as an intermediate asymptote, as we require
R(t) ≫ 1 but L(t) ≪ X. In view of the predicted scalings
with time, we must demand 1 ≪ t ≪ X 5/3.

Our numerical algorithm [14] is based on a representa-
tion of the harmonic ﬁeld in terms of a line integral over
the bounding contour; it involves tracking of the contour
nodes. We employed a variant of the boundary integral
method, suggested in Ref. [15]. The algorithm includes
solving an integral equation for an eﬀective density of
dipole moments (DMD) and evaluating another integral,
which yields a harmonic conjugated function (HCF). The
normal velocity of the interface is given by the derivative
of the HCF along the contour. The very large aspect
ratio of the dumbbell demands a diﬀerent discretization
compared to Ref. [15]. Indeed, the typical scale of vari-
ation of the kernel of the integral equation [15] over the
almost ﬂat neck of the dumbbell is close to 1: the initial
stripe thickness. On the other hand, the DMD changes
much slower there. This enabled us to considerably re-
duce the number of grid nodes in the neck region. We
used a piecewise constant function to approximate the
DMD, and a piecewise linear function to approximate
the contour. Therefore, each of the integrals was approx-
imated as a discrete sum of the DMD values multiplied by
an integral of the kernel between two neighboring nodes.
The latter integrals can be calculated analytically. The
HCF is evaluated at middle points between the nodes,
while the normal velocity at each node is evaluated using
the values of the HCF at neighboring middle points.

We used an explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method to track
the contour. The number of grid points, needed for an
accurate solution and contour tracking, decreases with
time together with the perimeter of the dumbbell. An
[15] ex-
obvious modiﬁcation of the algorithm of Ref.
ploited the 4-fold symmetry of the dumbbell. The area
conservation of the dumbbell was used for accuracy con-
trol. The time step chosen was 5 × 10−3 min |Ri/vi
n|,
where Ri and vi
n are the local curvature radius and nor-
mal velocity, respectively, in the node i of the contour.
This choice resulted in good area conservation:
in the
simulation described below less than 0.5% of the area

becomes smoother, the time step greatly increases.

Numerical results. Here we report a simulation with
X = 2000. Figure 2 shows snapshots of a part of the sys-
tem at times t = 0, 1000 and 3010. The stripe develops a
dumbbell shape (though some may prefer a comparison
with daisy petal). The lobe grows with time, the neck
widens. Shown in Fig. 3a is the retreat distance L(t)
versus time. A power law ﬁt yields exponent 0.60 which
coincides with the theoretical value 3/5. Figure 3b shows
the maximum dumbbell height, hmax, and the position
of the maximum, xmax
, versus time. Each of these two
quantities exhibits a power law; the ﬁtted exponents are
0.21 (for hmax) and 0.20 (for xmax
), in agreement with
the theoretical value 1/5. At long times, when the as-
pect ratio of the dumbbell is already not large enough,
the straight line in Fig. 3a slightly curves down, while
those in Fig. 3b curve up. We veriﬁed that for a shorter
stripe, X = 1000, deviations from the same straight lines
occur earlier, as expected. The time interval of the three
ﬁts, 20 < t < 1000, corresponds to the common parts of
the dependences for the two values of X.

FIG. 5: The dumbbell neck shape and dynamics. Figure a:
the neck shape at t = 13.9, found numerically (the dotted line
with circles), Eq. (15) (the solid line), and the ﬁrst term of
Eq. (15) (the dashed line). Figure b and its inset show, in a
log-log and linear scales, respectively, the pre-factors a and b
versus time (symbols). Also shown are a power-law ﬁt with
exponent 0.92 (ﬁgure b) and a linear ﬁt (inset).

three diﬀerent curves into a single one supports the sim-
ilarity Ansatz (14). Notice that the dumbbell shape
h(x1, t) in region II [R(t) ≪ x1 ≪ L(t)] belongs to the
similarity region. Indeed, assuming that Φ(ξ) ∼ ξ−1/2 at
ξ ≫ 1, we see that Eq. (14) yields Eq. (9) (where one
should substitute L ∼ t3/5 and R ∼ t1/5, and neglect 1/2
in the left hand side).

The self-similarity breaks down at a distance x1 ∼
L(t) ∼ t3/5 from the tip. Beyond this distance, Eq. (8)
predicts a power-law neck shape. Figure 5a shows the
shape of the dumbbell neck at time t = 13.9, computed
numerically. Also shown are the quantity

and its ﬁrst term, proportional to a. Equation (15) diﬀers
from Eq.
(8) in that (i) it accounts for contributions
from two dumbbell lobes, and (ii) it accounts for the sub-
leading term in the multipole expansion of the harmonic
function p. Note that a and b are the only adjustable
parameters in Eq. (15). The resulting proﬁle is almost
indistinguishable from the numerical proﬁle. The ﬁrst

4

term of Eq.
(15) already gives fairly good agreement.
The excellent agreement holds, on a shrinking interval
of x1, until t = 7020. Figure 5b and its inset show a
and b versus time, respectively. A power-law ﬁt of a(t)
yields exponent 0.92, close to our prediction 9/10. The
pre-factor b(t) behaves linearly with time. How does it
compare with the theory? As p ∼ 1/R(t) at the lobe
interface, the sub-leading term p ∼ r−1 sin φ does not
include R(t). Then, repeating the procedure which led
us to Eq. (8), we do obtain b(t) ∼ t.

Summary. We studied the UHS ﬂow in the case when
the inviscid ﬂuid is initially in the form of a long stripe.
We found that the resulting dumbbell dynamics exhibit
self-similarity with nontrivial exponents. The solution
we obtained is the ﬁrst analytical solution for an UHS
ﬂow that goes beyond a linear theory. Similarly to other
curve-shortening area-preserving relaxation models [16],
the stripe relaxation provides a useful characterization
of this non-integrable ﬂow. Its experimental realization
should not be diﬃcult.

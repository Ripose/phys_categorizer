Abstract

Classical particle mechanics on curved spaces is related to the ﬂow of ideal ﬂuids, by a dual

interpretation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As in second quantization, the procedure

relates the description of a system with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom to one with

inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. In some two-dimensional ﬂuid mechanics models a duality

transformation between the velocity potential and the stream function can be performed

relating sources and sinks in one model to vortices in the other. The particle mechanics

counterpart of the dual theory is reconstructed. In the quantum theory the strength of sources
and sinks, as well as vorticity are quantized; for the duality between theories to be preserved

these quantization conditions must be related.

1 Particles

The free motion of a classical particle with unit mass, moving in a smooth space
with metric gij(x) is described by the Lagrangean

where as usual the overdot represents a time-derivative. The Euler-Lagrange
equations imply that the particle moves on a geodesic:

The canonical formulation of this theory is constructed in terms of the momenta

and the hamiltonian

The time-development of any scalar function F (x, p) of the phase-space co-
ordinates is then determined by the Poisson brackets

A third formulation of the classical theory is provided by Hamilton’s principal
function1 S(x, t), which is the solution of the partial diﬀerential equation

For the case at hand this Hamilton-Jacobi equation takes the form

Particular solutions S are provided by the action for classical paths xi(τ ) obey-
ing the Euler-Lagrange equation (2), starting at time τ = 0 at an initial point
xi(0), and reaching the point xi(t) = xi at time τ = t:

An example of the class of theories of this type is that of a particle moving on
the surface of the unit sphere, S2. A convenient co-ordinate system is provided
by the polar angles (θ, ϕ), in terms of which

related to the total angular momentum by

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation (8) can itself be obtained in a straightforward
way from a variational principle: introduce a Lagrange multiplier ﬁeld ρ(x) and

The square root of the (time-independent) background metric has been included
to make the integration measure invariant under reparametrizations. Of course,
we could absorb it in the deﬁnition of Lagrange multiplier ﬁeld, but then ρ would
transform as a density rather than as scalar.

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation follows by requiring the action to be station-

ary w.r.t. variations of ρ:

For the ﬂuid ﬂow to be incompressible, the velocity ﬁeld must be divergence

where ∆ = gij
j is the covariant laplacean on scalar functions over the
space. It follows that the number of incompressible modes of ﬂow on the mani-
fold equals the number of zero-modes of the scalar laplacean. For example, for
ﬂow on the sphere S2 (or any other compact Riemann surface) there is only
one incompressible mode, the trivial one with vi = 0 everywhere.

For a given geometry gij(x), the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
(8), (22) provides a special solution of the Euler equation (25); for a conservative
system: ∂S/∂t =
jvi = 0. Ac-
cordingly, this solution describes geodesic ﬂow starting from the point (θ∗, ϕ∗).
To turn this into a complete solution of the ﬂuid-dynamical equations (24),
(25) it remains to solve for the density ρ. The equation of continuity takes the
form

In addition to the trivial solution ρ = ρ0 = constant, v =
is possible to ﬁnd non-trivial solutions of equation (29) for spatially varying
density ρ. As an example, we consider ﬂow in a 2-dimensional space; in this
case one can introduce a generalized stream function T (x, t), dual to the ﬂuid
momentum, and write

This represents the total ﬂow of matter from the hemisphere centered on the

3 Vortices

The dual relationship between the velocity potential S and the stream function
T suggests to study the dynamics of a ﬂuid for which T is the velocity potential:

vi =

1
ρ∗ ∇

iT.

The constant ρ∗ has been included for dimensional reasons. Like before, this
velocity ﬁeld is stationary: ∂vi/∂t = 0, but it is not geodesic.
Indeed, the
velocity ﬁeld describes motion under the inﬂuence of an external potential;
speciﬁcally:

irrespective of their physical interpretation. Now again, as (

where h represents the external potential. Because of the potential nature of
jvi = 0, but as
the ﬂow, eq. (44), the local vorticity again vanishes:
eq.(43) shows, this is not necessarily true globally. Indeed, in singular points
of the original geodesic ﬂuid ﬂow (with sources/sinks), the dual ﬂow generally
has vortices/anti-vortices.

A further remarkable property, is that the dual ﬂow is divergence free:

v = 0

∇ ·

⇔

∆α = 0,

where-ever v is well-deﬁned; obviously, the result can only be true because of
the two singular points (θ = π/2; ϕ = ϕ∗) and (θ = π/2; ϕ = ϕ∗ + π), where
vi and its divergence are not well-deﬁned, i.e. topologically the velocity ﬁeld is
deﬁned on a cylinder, rather than a sphere. These two points are centers of
vorticity, as follows directly from eq.(43), which in the present context can be
rewritten as

vidxi = 2πω,

IΓ

for any closed curve Γ winding once around the singular point (π/2, ϕ∗); as this
curve also winds once around the other singular point in the opposite direction,
they clearly deﬁne a pair of vortices of equal but opposite magnitude.

As the ﬂow is divergence free, it follows that in this case there can be non-
trivial incompressible and stationary ﬂow modes: for constant density ρ1 one
has

∂ρ1

ρ1 = 0

(ρ1v) = 0,

(52)

and the equation of continuity is satisﬁed.

The nature of the ﬂow lines deﬁned by eq.(48) is clear: they are parallel
circles of equidistant points around the centers of vorticity. On these circles
the velocity is constant in magnitude, implying by (49) that sin θ cos(ϕ
≡
cos β = constant. For example, for ϕ∗ = 0 we get x = cos β = constant; the
ﬂow line then is the circle where this plane of constant x cuts the unit sphere.

4 The dual particle model

Having clariﬁed the nature of the (incompressible) ﬂow described by the dual ve-
locity potential T /ρ∗, we now reconstruct the corresponding particle-mechanics
model for which T /ρ∗ is Hamilton’s principal function. From eqs.(47), (49) we
observe that the hamiltonian is of the form H1 = K + h, with for the speciﬁc
case at hand a kinetic-energy term:

5 Quantum theory

The quantum theory of a particle on a curved manifold is well-established.
For the wave function to be well-deﬁned and single-valued, the momenta must
satisfy the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions

for any closed classical orbit Γ. For the free particle of unit mass on the unit
sphere the left-hand side is

pidxi = 2πn¯h,

IΓ

v2dτ = ω2T = 2πω,

T

0
Z

where T = 2π/ω is the period of the orbit. Hence the quantization rule amounts
to quantization of the rotation frequency (the angular momentum): ω = n¯h.

For the dual model, the same quantity takes the value

vidxi =

IΓ

0
Z

T1

v2dτ =

ω2T1
sin2 β

= ω ω1T1 = 2πω,

(69)

and again ω = n¯h. As the quantization conditions in the two dual models are
the same, the duality can be preserved in the quantum theory.

If this is to be true also in the ﬂuid interpretation, the quantization con-
ditions must be respected at that level as well. Now the ﬁrst quantization
condition for the integral (68) is interpreted in the ﬂuid dynamical context as
a quantization of the ﬂuid momentum, cf. eq.(33). The second quantization
condition (69) has a twofold interpretation: ﬁrst, according to eqs.(42), (43) it

9

quantizes the strength of the ﬂuid sources and sinks in the model of free geodesic
ﬂow; the agreement between the two quantization conditions is then obvious:
in order for the strength of the source/sink to satisfy a quantization condition,
the amount of ﬂuid transfered from one to the other must be quantized as well.
In the context of the dual model however, the condition imposes the quan-
tization of vorticity in the quantum ﬂuid [3]. In the more general context of
quantum models of ﬂuids in geodesic ﬂow on a compact two-dimensional surface
and their duals described by the stream functions, this observation shows that
duality at the quantum level requires the quantization of sources in one model
to be directly related to the quantization of vorticity in the dual one. This
situation closely parallels the relation between the quantization of monopole
charge [4] and the quantization of the magnetic ﬂux of ﬂuxlines [5] in three
dimensions.

We study the eﬀect of a turbulent ﬂow of liquid sodium generated in the von K´arm´an geometry, on
the localized ﬁeld of a magnet placed close to the frontier of the ﬂow. We observe that the ﬁeld can
be transported by the ﬂow on distances larger than its integral length scale. In the most turbulent
conﬁgurations, the mean value of the ﬁeld advected at large distance vanishes. However, the rms
value of the ﬂuctuations increases linearly with the magnetic Reynolds number. The advected ﬁeld
is strongly intermittent.

Transport of a magnetic ﬁeld by an electrically con-
ducting ﬂuid plays a central role in various astrophysical
processes [1] as well as in laboratory plasmas. Magnetic
ﬁelds induced by ﬂows of liquid metals in the presence
of an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld have also been
observed in laboratory experiments: the generation of a
toroidal ﬁeld from an axial one by diﬀerential rotation
(the “ω-eﬀect”) [2, 3, 4], the generation of an axial
ﬁeld by an external one applied transversally to the
axis of a swirling ﬂow (the “Parker mechanism” [5])
[6]. These induction eﬀects are the key mechanisms
of most astrophysical and geophysical dynamo models
[5, 8, 9, 10]. However, magnetic eigenmodes generated
by dynamo mechanisms are usually strongly localized
in space whereas induction eﬀects have been studied
to date with externally applied uniform magnetic ﬁelds
(except in reference [11]). Geophysical or astrophysical
ﬂows generally involve regions of strong diﬀerential
rotation or strong helicity which are not located in
the same part of the ﬂow but are both believed to

to understand how the magnetic ﬁeld induced in one
region is transported to an other by strongly turbulent
ﬂows.
In addition, below the dynamo threshold and
when the externally applied magnetic ﬁeld is weak, such
that it does not aﬀect the ﬂow, the induced magnetic
ﬁeld behaves as a passive vector. Transport of a passive
vector by turbulence is a problem at an intermediate
level of complexity between advection of a passive scalar
(a pollutant for instance) and advection of vorticity
[7]. We report here the experimental observation of a
magnetic ﬁeld advected by a turbulent ﬂow and study
its statistical properties.

We have measured the induced magnetic ﬁeld ~B gen-
erated by a turbulent von K´arm´an swirling ﬂow of liquid

≈

sodium (VKS2) away from a localized external magnetic
ﬁeld ~B0(~r) (see Fig. 1). The experimental set-up is sim-
ilar to the previously described one [4], but involves the
following modiﬁcations: the ﬂow volume (150 l) and the
driving power (300 kW) have been doubled and a temper-
ature regulation facility has been implemented. The ﬂow
is generated by rotating two disks of radius R = 154.5
mm, 371 mm apart in a cylindrical vessel, 578 mm in in-
ner diameter and 604 mm in length. The disks are ﬁtted
with 8 curved blades of height h = 41.2 mm driven at a
rotation frequency up to Ω = 20 Hz. A turbulent swirling
ﬂow with an integral Reynolds number, Re = 2πR2Ω/ν,
up to 4 106 is thus generated. The corresponding mag-
netic Reynolds number is, Rm = 2πµ0σR2Ω
30, where
µ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum and σ is the
electrical conductivity of sodium. The mean ﬂow has
the following characteristics: the ﬂuid is ejected radially
outward by the disks; this drives an axial ﬂow toward
the disks along their axis and a recirculation in the op-
posite direction along the cylinder lateral boundary [12].
In the case of counter-rotating disks, the azimuthal ﬂow
involves a strong shear in the vicinity of the mid-plane
between the disks, which drives large turbulent ﬂuctua-
tions [13]. Positive frequencies correspond to disks rota-
tion such that the trailing edge of each blade is convex.
A localized magnetic ﬁeld ~B0(~r) is generated by a
NdFeB cylindrical magnet, 22 mm in diameter and 10
mm in height, placed close to the lateral boundary, 195
mm away from the center along the z-axis (M in Fig. 1).
The maximum value of the ﬁeld created by the magnet
in its vicinity is about 0.1 T but decays to less than 1
mT, at a distance 100 mm away from the magnet. The
three components of the ﬁeld induced when the ﬂow is
set into motion are measured with an in-house linear
array of 10 Hall transducers (Sentron 2SA-10). They
are separated by a distance equal to 28 mm, the ﬁrst

of the induced ﬁeld depends very weakly on the rota-
tion frequency, as shown in Fig. 3 where the components

slight scatter of the points measured for higher frequen-
cies. Within error bars, this can be ascribed to the mean
induction related to the Earth magnetic ﬁeld. Conse-
quently, we consider that the time averaged magnetic
ﬁeld
induced by the turbulent ﬂow submitted to
~B0 roughly vanishes. We thus concentrate on the prop-
erties of its ﬂuctuations. The standard deviation of the
ﬂuctuations of each component is an order of magnitude
larger than the one obtained without the magnet (i.e.
when the Earth magnetic ﬁeld is acting alone) and in-
creases linearly with the rotation frequency (see Fig. 3).
Despite that ~B0 is larger along the z-axis, we observe the
same level of the ﬂuctuations on the y and z components.
The larger ﬂuctuations of Bx are related to the elonga-
tional mean ﬂow around the center O, which is directed
along the axis of the disks.

Using a linear array of probes, we can study the decay
of the amplitude of rms ﬂuctuations of the induced ﬁeld
when the distance to the magnet increases. The results
are displayed in Fig. 4. We observe that the decay can
be ﬁtted by an exponential. The typical decay length is
about 100 mm which is comparable to the integral scale
of the ﬂow. This is not much larger than the magnetic
3/4 or the skin depth R/√Rm. How-
diﬀusive scale R/Rm
ever, measurements at diﬀerent rotation frequencies from
8 to 16 Hz have not displayed signiﬁcant variations of the
slopes in Fig. 4. Thus, the typical decay length does not
seem to depend on Re or Rm.

Power spectra of the ﬂuctuations of the induced mag-
netic ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 5. As for the case of induced
ﬁeld in the presence of a uniform external applied ﬁeld

Thus, the spatial proﬁles of magnetic induction along
the y-axis are recorded. The magnet is 200 to 360 mm
away from the probes such that its ﬁeld, measured in
the absence of ﬂow motion, is comparable or less than
the Earth magnetic ﬁeld.

rotation frequency, Ω = 15 Hz. The horizontal dashed line
corresponds to 0.26G, i.e.
twice the standard deviation of
the ﬂuctuations induced by the Earth magnetic ﬁeld alone.

[4], these spectra have a much steeper slope above the
rotation frequency than below. The inset of Fig. 5 shows
that the upper frequency part of the spectrum scales with
the rotation frequency. The intensities of the spectra are
the same for the three components of the magnetic ﬁeld
above the rotation frequency. The x component is larger
at low frequency, as expected if, as noted above, this re-
sults from the elongational geometry of the mean ﬂow
in the vicinity of the measurement point. Another argu-
ment in favor of this interpretation is that spectra with
the same intensity at all frequencies for the three com-
ponents of the ﬁeld are observed at other locations away
from the mid-plane.

The probability density functions (PDF) of the ﬂuctu-
ations of the three components of the induced magnetic
ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 6. As already noticed, the x-
component displays larger ﬂuctuations than the two oth-
ers. In addition, we observe that the shape of its PDF
is also qualitatively diﬀerent from the one of the y and
z-components that display roughly exponential tails. At
low rotation frequency or far enough from the magnet,
the histograms become less stretched. When measure-
ments are performed out of the mid-plane, the PDF are
strongly asymmetric and the asymmetry depends on the
location of the probe as well as on the sign of the ro-
tation frequency. We note that roughly Gaussian his-
tograms were observed in the case of the induced ﬁeld in
the presence of an uniform external applied ﬁeld [4].

These results show that magnetic induction by a tur-
bulent ﬂow of an electrically conducting ﬂuid, measured
away from an applied localized magnetic ﬁeld, diﬀer sig-
niﬁcantly from induction due to a uniform applied ﬁeld.
When the applied ﬁeld is uniform, the mean induced ﬁeld
has been found larger than its ﬂuctuations (except for

the components that must vanish at some locations be-
cause of symmetry constraints) [4, 6]. On the contrary,
away from an applied localized ﬁeld, rms ﬂuctuations are
much larger than the mean induced ﬁeld. Direct time
recordings show very intermittent signals with bursts of
magnetic ﬁeld (see Fig. 2). This is the picture one ex-
pects if intense eddies move randomly from the neighbor-
hood of the magnet to the probe, transporting magnetic
ﬁeld. The PDF of the transported ﬁeld (Fig. 6) conﬁrm
the intermittent character of the ﬂuctuations. For Rm
large enough, they display exponential tails similar to
some ﬂow conﬁgurations involving the random advection
of a scalar ﬁeld [14] although the values of the respective
Prandtl numbers strongly diﬀer.

The mean transported magnetic ﬁeld measured by the
probe almost averages to zero because its orientation
is randomly distributed. Strictly speaking, this is ex-
pected in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The small-
ness of the mean values measured in the present exper-
iment show that ﬂuctuations are dominant compared to
the mean ﬂow in the transport process of the ﬁeld, at
least as far as its orientation is concerned. In order to
check our hypothesis concerning the dominant eﬀect of
ﬂuctuations compared to the mean ﬂow, we have also
measured the induced ﬁeld with only one rotating disk.
The ﬂow is then much less turbulent. We have recorded
the induced ﬁeld transported from the magnet placed in
the bulk (P in Fig. 1) to a Hall probe placed close to the
rotating disk. Both the mean and rms values of the in-
duced ﬁeld components vary linearly with Rm, the slope
of the mean being larger. Thus, when the eﬀect of the
mean ﬂow is large enough, the transported ﬁeld does not
average to zero and can be larger than the ﬂuctuations.
Finally, it is worth discussing some consequences of
the present results on simple dynamo processes. Most
dynamo models consist of a feed-back loop involving sev-
eral steps in which induction processes occur in diﬀerent
regions of the ﬂow. For instance, in the case of an alpha-
omega dynamo, toroidal ﬁeld is created in regions with
strong diﬀerential rotation from the poloidal component
and poloidal ﬁeld is regenerated from the toroidal one in
regions containing cyclonic eddies with the same helicity.
In this mechanism, as well as in others, it is crucial that
the mean ﬁeld component generated in some region is
transported coherently to another region. We show that
the mean ﬁeld orientation is lost if turbulent ﬂuctuations
are large [15]

These observations question the validity of dynamo
models based only on the geometry of the mean ﬂow, thus
neglecting the eﬀect of large scale turbulent ﬂuctuations,
that are the most eﬃcient to transport large amount of
ﬁeld while changing its orientation. The problem is to es-
timate to which extent the dynamo threshold computed
as if the mean ﬂow were acting alone, is shifted by turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations. This question has been addressed only
recently [16] and should not be confused with dynamo
generated by random ﬂows with zero mean [17]. It has
been shown that weak turbulent ﬂuctuations do not shift
the dynamo threshold of the mean ﬂow at ﬁrst order. In
addition, in the case of small scale ﬂuctuations, there is
no shift at second order either, if the ﬂuctuations have no
helicity. This explains why the observed dynamo thresh-
old in Karlsruhe and Riga experiments has been found
in good agreement with the one computed as if the mean
ﬂow were acting alone, i.e. neglecting turbulent ﬂuc-
tuations [18]. Recent numerical simulations have also
displayed a shift in threshold only at second order with
small ﬂuctuations but a more complex bifurcation struc-
ture for larger ones [19]. Thus, the problem is still open
in the parameter range of the sodium experiments with

4

unconstrained ﬂows that involve very large ﬂuctuations
[4, 20].

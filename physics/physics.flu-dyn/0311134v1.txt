Introduction

Convection in the liquid core of the Earth, caused by the radiactive heating and compositional processes

[1], is the subject of numerous researches, usually concerned with the geomagnetic ﬁeld generation, also.

The last few decades saw a fascinating development in this area [2]. Based on the MHD large-scale

equations, numerical simulations can reproduce diﬀerent geomagnetic and geophysical phenomena:

various properties of the geomagnetic ﬁeld (e.g., its reversals and spectrum), eastward rotation of the

inner core of the Earth as well as the realistic ratio of the kinetic and magnetic energies [3].

However, the wide range of spatial and temporal scales make the direct numerical simulations

(DNS) very cumbersome. The diﬃculty is caused by the small values of the transport coeﬃcients: for
instance the kinematic viscosity of the liquid core is νM = 10−6m2s−1, and the thermal diﬀusivity:
κM = 10−5 m2s−1 (here the subscript M corresponds to the molecular values). This gives estimates

models in geodynamo theory which suppressed instabilities at the small scales, e.g., the model of

hyperdiﬀusivity [3], gave rise to new questions concerned with interpretation of the results obtained [6].

The more consequential way is an application of the semiempirical models of turbulence [7]. Usually,

these models are based on assumptions on the cascade transfer similar to Kolmogorov’s, which give

descriptions of the average eﬀect of the small-scale ﬁeld ﬂuctuations onto the large-scale ﬂow in terms

of the eddy diﬀusivity. The recent studies of the subgrid [8] and complex models [9, 10] of the thermal

convection and dynamo problems in the rotating sphere revealed the principal possibility of describing

the small-scale ﬂuctuations in the turbulence with the desired Reynolds and Peclet numbers much like

Kolmogorov’s model.

These models work up to the regime of moderate rotation speed. Further increase of the Coriolis

force can reduce the total kinetic energy and even suppress convection at all. From linear analysis it

follows that the critical Rayleigh number depends on the Ekman number like Rcr

·

characteristics of the ﬁelds must be checked very carefully. We show that the direct applications of

the traditional models of the turbulence, based on the mix-length assumptions, lead to results that

diﬀer from the observations by orders of magnitude. The cause of such disagreement lies in the daily

rapid rotation of the Earth, which gives rise to new characteristic spatial scales in the core [14]. As a

result, the energy distribution in the spectrum changes, which makes the application of the Prandtl-

Kolmogorov’s approach to the eddy diﬀusivity estimate diﬃcult. Convection at these new scales plays

the crucial role in the energy balance of the whole system and changes the estimate of the total energy

by orders of magnitude. Even a simple account of these eﬀects leads to essential change of the rate of

the energy dissipation and thus to a better agreement of LSS models with the observations.

In the section 2 we introduce the large-scale equations of the thermal convection and consider

the Prandtl-Kolmogorov’s assumptions on the eddy diﬀusion. In the section 3 we recall the basics of

convection in a rapidly rotating body and estimate the subgrid diﬀusion. Afterwards, this estimate is

used in the large-scale model, section 4. The discussion of results is in section 5.

2 The large-scale equations

The problem of the thermal convection in the Earth’s core can be reduced to the problem in the

spherical shell. Let the surface of the sphere, radius r0 (in the spherical system of coordinates (r, θ, ϕ)),

rotating with angular velocity Ω around the z-axis. This sphere contains a concentric solid inner sphere,

radius ri, and the outer spherical layer (ri < r < r0) is ﬁlled with an incompressible liquid (V = 0).
The inner sphere is allowed to rotate freely around the z-axis due to viscous torque. Convection in

the Boussinesq approximation in the outer sphere is described by the Navier-Stokes equation and by

the heat ﬂux equation. Choosing L = r0 as the unit of length, velocity V, time t and pressure p can
be measured in units of κM /L, L2/κM and 2ΩρκM , respectively. Then, the governing equations can
be written in the form

no-slip boundary condition for velocity V and zero temperature ﬂuctuations at the shell boundaries.

The system (1-2,4) was successfully studied in the regimes of the laminar convection using diﬀerent

numerical approaches [16, 2]. However, these regimes are still very far from the desired estimates for

parameters using DNS caused numerical instabilities and required application of turbulencs models

[8]. However, even the direct usage of the known models of turbulence is not trivial.

To support this point we oﬀer a simple estimate of the eddy diﬀusivity, based on the most popular

velocity V = 3

10−3m s−1, gives νT = 2

mix-length model of the turbulence. Following the Prandtl-Kolmogorov hypotheses, the eddy diﬀusion
at the scale l can be estimated as νT = (εl4)1/3, where ε = v3/l is the rate of energy dissipation and v
is a velocity at the scale l. Even the largest estimate, based on the main scale l = L and the west drift

Such situation corresponds to the case, where the classical ideas on the direct cascade of energy

from the main scale L to the dissipative scale are violated and additional information on ε at the

dissipative scale is needed. As we see below in the section 3, it appears that in the case of the rapid

rotating body the energy in the spectrum is shifted to the small scales, those which DNS cannot
resolve even at the onset of convection. This is the reason, why any attempts to estimate νT in the

turbulent regime at scales compared with the grid resolution, lead to the non-selfconsistent behaviour

≥

of the turbulent model.

The way out of such diﬃculties is make proper assumptions on the spectral properties of the

solution in the range of the high wave numbers.

3 The model of columns

The origin of the problem can be seen from the analysis of the linerized system (1-2) at the onset of

convection in the limit of small Rossby and Ekman numbers. As it was shown in [11] already (see

also recent paper [17]), at the onset of convection the structure of the ﬂow tends to develop columns

along z-direction, such that ∂/∂ϕ

Linerization of the system (1-2) leads to the balance of the Archemedean and viscous terms in the
E−1/3V . The balance of the convective and viscous terms in the
E−2/3T , from which follows the estimate of the critical Rayleigh number
E−1/3. (For convenience we omitted index M .) Such, at the onset of convection for system (1-2),
E1/3L, deﬁned by the balance of the Coriolis and
10−5 is beyond the level of DNS. If this asymptotic is correct,

the critical Rayleigh number in the Earth’s core is Rcr

105 [2]. As we show below, the predicted
column-like form of the ﬂow is very important for estimates of the subgrid dissipation in the liquid

core.

The main assumption is, that even in the turbulent regime believed to be in the Earth’s liquid

core, the ﬂow tends to elongated structures with the smallest scale lE, predicted by the linear analysis.

It is from this scale ideas of the direct cascade of energy are applicable. To simplify the problem, we

estimate the isotropical eddy diﬀusion, based on the scale (lE). In particular, instead of the estimate

Equations (1–2, 4) are solved using the control-volume method (Simple algorithm) [18] on the staggered

grid (nr, nθ, nϕ) = (45, 45, 64). This method is based on the ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation and
demonstrates very high numerical stability for the regimes with strong convection1. For ease of
calculation, we renormalize equations (1–2, 4) using turbulent diﬀusion units, so that instead of

a value of the kinetic energy EK comparable with the observations. Having in mind that the velocity

ﬁeld and the eddy diﬀusion are connected in our model, we consider this agreement to be worth to

note.

5 Conclusions

We propose the scenario of the turbulent thermal convection in the rapid rotating body, when the

Coriolis force shifts the system to the origin of the small scales already at the onset of convection, and

show that further increasing of the intensity of the heat sources leads to a turbulent regime, which is

still far from the Kolmogorov’s case. It appears that predictions of the linear analysis at the onset of

convection are applicable to the eddy diﬀusion estimate in the regime of the fully developed turbulence.

Though the original problem is highly anisotropical, the “isotropical” estimate of the eddy diﬀusion

gives a kinetic energy of the system comparable with the observations. Note that introduction of

the magnetic ﬁeld will not change the problem in principal, because at the scales lE considered the
corresponding micro-scale magnetic Reynolds number is already rm ≪
due to the Ohmic dissipation process. On the other hand, it is not yet clear how the west drift velocity

1 and the magnetic ﬁeld decays

relates to the ﬂow at the scales lE and diﬀerent interpretations of observations can exist. This question

requires the solution of the full dynamo problem.

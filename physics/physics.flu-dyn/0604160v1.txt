Spectra of Stable Non-Noble Gas Single Bubble Sonoluminescence

(Dated: January 5, 2014)

A commonly accepted view is that stable Single Bubble Sonoluminescence (SBSL) can only be
achieved in the presence of a noble gas or hydrogen. In air-seeded bubbles, the content of diatomic
gasses is burned oﬀ to leave the small amount of argon needed to sustain stable operation. Here we
report that long term stable SBSL can be sustained with only nitrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen/oxygen
mixtures being present. Compared to that of a stable argon bubble, the emission is much weaker
and the spectrum looks much colder. Oscillating states as well as recycling states are also observed.
An intriguing saturation eﬀect seems connected with the presence of water vapor in the bubble.

PACS numbers: 78.60.Mq, 47.55.Bx, 47.52.+j

Recently we reported a second type of recycling mode
in Single Bubble Sonoluminescence (SBSL) [1]. This oc-
curs for air-seeded bubbles with dissolved gas content

trast to the usual recycling mode denoted type 1, which
reaches the same maximum intensity level as that of the
stable bubble, the intensity in the new type 2 mode is
down by approximately a factor of 20. Furthermore,
spectra of the emission from a single bubble in the type 2
mode look like the bubble is much colder than an argon
dominated bubble, thus providing a link to multi bubble
sonoluminescence (MBSL).

The dissociation hypothesis [2] was invented to explain
the stability of SBSL air-seeded bubbles at dissolution
levels, where the bubble growth elsewise would not be
limited. This hypothesis, since veriﬁed in many experi-
ments, suggests that the bubbles burn oﬀ their content
of diatomic gasses leaving behind the small amount of
argon needed to sustain stable operation. The chemical
reaction products, readily dissolvable, diﬀuse out of the
bubble during the expansion and following contraction.
Our interpretation of the type 2 mode follows this pic-
ture. The bubble is driven so hard that after the splitting
oﬀ of a microbubble as is the usual explanation for the
type 1 event, it sucks in air too fast to burn oﬀ the di-
atomic molecules. Thus it grows to the instability limit
while still being predominantly an air bubble. The role
of the water vapor could not be established.

In order to check this hypothesis we prepared a cell
with gas mixtures involving no noble gasses (nor hydro-
gen). Gasses used are either pure nitrogen, oxygen, or a
4:1 nitrogen-oxygen mixture to simulate air without ar-
gon. The noble gas content in all cases are below 1ppm.
As we had expected, SBSL in the type 2 recycling state
is possible and at the same level of emission. The spec-
trum also looks very similar to that obtained from air-
seeded bubbles. Thus our hypothesis regarding the type
2 recycling seems veriﬁed.

However, to our surprise, stable SBSL was also pos-
sible. This has to the best of our knowledge not been

reported before. The stable radiation was obtained for
extended periods of up to 45 minutes for nitrogen bub-
bles. The ﬂuctuations and long term drift of the relative
phase of the ﬂashes were 100 ns or less with short term
ﬂuctuations within 40 ns and no preferred direction of
drift. At higher levels of gas pressure an oscillating state
is encountered at the low end of the emission range. Such
an oscillating state has previously been reported for ni-
trogen bubbles [3]. These authors also reported on irreg-
ular peaking emission. This phenomenon we ﬁnd to be
associated with small amounts of argon being allowed to
diﬀuse into the cell.

The spectrum of the stable phase very much coincides
with that of the type 2 case for air seeded bubbles with to-
tal output being similar in the case of nitrogen and the ni-
trogen/oxygen mixture but an order of magnitude lower
for pure oxygen which also seems to be colder. Thus this
experiment is further veriﬁcation of the dissociation the-
ory and ﬁts the picture of the strong and hotter emission
from an air-seeded bubble being connected with argon
accumulation. To obtain stable emission from non-noble
gasses, however, must call for a delicate balance between
the diﬀusion into the bubble and the burning of diatomic
gasses. Presumably this leaves the bubble much more
susceptible to environmental factors like microstreaming,
nearby particles, and chemical balance. All factors, that
are expected to aﬀect the long term stability. In view of
this, while the levels of ﬂuctuations and long term drift
are higher than would be expected for e.g. air or ar-
gon seeded bubbles at high levels of emission which can
be stable at ns levels, the changes are still surprisingly
small.

The cell used is described in more detail in ref. [4],
but is essentially a 5 or 6 cm high and 6 cm diameter
cylindrical quartz cell with metal caps at both ends so
it can be sealed using a pressure relief bag. Piezoelectric
transducers are mounted on one or both caps for the
drive, which for most experiments reported (6 cm cell),
is at a frequency of 22140 Hz. A notable diﬀerence is the
use of a heater to avoid contamination with hydrogen.

is as follows. The water is subjected to alternating de-
gassing at water vapor pressure and ﬂushing with the
ﬁnal gas to be used for several hours in 15 minutes in-
tervals. Under this whole process the water is violently
stirred by a magnetic stirrer. After a ﬁnal 15 min. ﬂush-
ing with the ﬁnal gas composition and concentration, the
water is transferred in a closed system to the cell and
cooled to the operating temperature ( 9◦C) for several
hours before commencing measurements.

As described in ref. [1] a crude spectrum is obtained by
placing 7 photomultiplier tubes (PMT’s) around the cell
with narrow band (10 nm) optical ﬁlters in front. The
signals are ampliﬁed and collected by a computer with
an extra PMT giving the timing signal for the sampling.
This method was chosen primarily because it allows us to
get spectra of weak and shortlived states but also since
it allows us to get ﬂash by ﬂash control of the averaging
time of the spectra. Thus we have precise knowledge of
the time of collection so the radiative state of the bub-
ble can be established. The timing of the ﬂash is also
recorded with a resolution of 50 ns with averaging pro-
viding a better resolution for slower ﬂuctuations. For
extremely weak signals (oxygen bubbles), however, a dif-
ferent procedure, to be described later, was used.

The stable states were in the case of the nitro-
gen/oxygen mixture found in the whole interval inves-
tigated from dissolved gas levels of 180 to 900 mbar.
For nitrogen the range of degassing where a stable state
was observed is 100 to 320 mbar, with the intensity level
falling below our limit of detection at the low end. How-
ever, type 2 emission was observed up to 900 mbar. At
low levels of dissolved gas, the interval of stability is quite
narrow with the range of stability seemingly being wider
for pure nitrogen than for the nitrogen/oxygen mixture.
Near ambient pressure the intervals open up and we are

able to measure the change in spectrum versus ampli-
tude of the drive. Apart from type 2 (only recycling
state present), we also see the oscillating state observed
by Hiller et al [3]. These states look very much like those
recently observed for air-seeded bubble at very low drives
by Thomas et al [5]. This suggests that these low inten-
sity states from air-seeded bubbles have the same origin
of being mainly nitrogen/oxygen bubbles.

With gas levels of more than approximately 200 mbar,
we encounter the type 2 recycling. This has essentially
the same time scale of recycling as the air-seeded bub-
bles, which strongly supports our explanation of type 2
recycling having its origin in incomplete burn-oﬀ. Also it
indicates the size R0 of the bubbles at breaking point to
be of the same scale of approximately 6 µm. This is cor-
roborated by observation of an anisotropic 10% period
doubling in the measurements of the 280 mbar nitrogen
bubble just before and at the level of type 2 recycling.

In Fig. 1 we display a 100 s long timeseries obtained for
a single bubble in water prepared at a dissolved gas level
of 880 mbar (nitrogen/oxygen (4:1) mixture) at room
temperature and cooled to 9◦C. The amplitude of the
drive is stepped up rapidly at 4 distinct short time in-
tervals with stable regions of emission in between, be-
fore ﬁnally type 2 recycling sets in. Note the overlap
in regimes, as the bubble several times relapses into the
quiet state, although the sound pressure is kept constant
in this last part of the sequence. Since the emission is
weak and narrow band optical ﬁlters are employed, the
average number of photons recorded per ﬂash is of the
order of 1. Our claim of stability is therefore based on
the absence of oscillations or peaking and the stability of
the relative phase.

In Fig. 2 we show spectra taken for stably emitting ni-
trogen bubbles (dissolved gas level of 220 mbar) and oxy-
gen bubbles (220 mbar). Especially the oxygen bubble is
so weak that it can hardly be discerned by the unaided
eye even after long time adjustment to complete dark-
ness. These spectra are therefore obtained by freerun-
ning the data acquisition cards at 5 MHz alternatingly
for a prolonged period. Using the information from the
phaselocked sawtooth signal fed to both cards one can
then obtain averaged ﬂash intensities from the remain-
ing 6 channels with a highly improved signal/noise ratio.
The spectra have been normalized by the spectrum of
an air bubble driven at a suﬃciently low level to ensure
that the spectrometer is not overloaded. The latter spec-
trum has in a separate experiment been shown to ﬁt well
to 14000 K blackbody radiation in the regime of 300 nm
- 700 nm but dropping below this in the extreme ultravi-
olet range (VUV) (see e.g. [6]). The spectra can be well
ﬁtted to black body radiation with temperatures 8000 K
and 6580 for nitrogen respectively oxygen with the slight
overshoot in the VUV range caused by the correspond-
ing drop in the normalizing spectrum. By comparison a
stable weakly radiating air-seeded bubble still displays a
spectrum like that of the reference bubble apart from a
scaling factor. The temperatures obtained are remark-
able close to the expected dissociation temperatures for
the gasses involved.

The change in the spectrum when increasing the am-
plitude in the type 2 case displayed in Fig. 1 is shown in
Fig. 3. The spectrum starts out looking very much like
those obtained for the stable case but gradually change
to look like a blackbody spectrum. For comparison we
have included the spectrum of a type 2 state measured
for a bubble where the dissolved gas is air at the same
level of dissolution. In these ﬁgures the spectra are ob-
tained as a long term average over many periods of the
recycling. As seen the spectra look very similar giving
further credence to the assumption that the mechanism
behind is the same.

The apparent temperatures are what would be ex-
pected from bubbles that are ineﬃciently trying to burn
the diatomic gasses. However, an interpretation in terms
of actual temperatures, though tempting, is questionable,
as the mechanism behind the emission is still unclear.

In the following we shall concentrate on the nitrogen
bubbles to keep the chemical picture as simple as possi-
ble. At the low end of the nitrogen concentration we only
see the stable state. At higher nitrogen levels we see the
oscillating state akin to that observed by Thomas et al
[5]. The main feature of this state is an oscillation seen
at all wavelengths so that the color temperature stays
nearly constant, and with amplitude in phase with a cor-
responding oscillation in radius. Unfortunately we are
not able to calibrate our system well enough to tell the
exact relation.

of Fig. 1. From bottom to top the drive amplitude is (⊡)
130.0 mV, (N) 130.5 mV, (×) 132.0 mV, (+) 133.4 mV. As
seen by comparison to Fig. 2 there is an overlap with the
constant emission state. For comparison we have included the
spectrum of a type 2 state measured for a air-seeded bubble
at the same level of dissolution ((cid:4)). The curve is black body
radiation at 8000 K normalized with black body radiation at
14000 K for comparison.

into the cell, the behavior changes dramatically. In what
follows we show the result of a simple analysis on some
examples of states observed for a nitrogen seeded bubble
at 28 % saturation contaminated with argon.

Since we are not able to follow the bubble movements
simultaneously with obtaining the spectrum, we resort
to using the relative phase for calculating the bubble size
[7]. The model is based on the Rayleigh-Plesset equa-
tions taking into account water vapor but disregarding
the chemical processes. A problem is that for obvious
reasons we are not able to use the dissociation theory
to calculate the actual composition of the gas inside the
bubble as we clearly deal with incomplete burn-oﬀ.

The calibration can thus only be based on two ﬁx-
points, the occurrence of period doubling, and the onset
of shape instability leading to type 2 recycling. This ﬁxes
the bubble size to approximately 6-7 µm at the onset of
type 2 behavior. The absolute pressure Pa is more diﬃ-
cult to assess. However, a knowledge of the cell gained
from measurements on air seeded bubles leads us to adopt
the value 1.5 bar for the corresponding pressure. Assum-
ing a constant average concentration of nitrogen in the
bubble, a model calculation leads to c ≈ 0.001 compared
to the degassing level of c ≈ 0.3. From the diﬀusion equa-
tion we ﬁnd that the bubble must burn approximately 105
molecules of nitrogen per ﬂash which is the same order
of magnitude as found for an air-seeded bubble [9].

The spectral temperature is determined by ﬁts to the
blackbody spectrum which for the nitrogen spectrum ﬁts
quite well. For the oscillating state at drive levels be-
low that of the stable state and a transient state into the

FIG. 4: Timeseries obtained for a nitrogen bubble prepared
with 280 mbar gas content showing a peaking state. The
sound pressure converted from the drive voltage as described
in the text is approximately 1.42 bar, Also shown are the
ﬁts for the ambient radius R0, apparent temperature T, and
prefactor a.

stable state, the apparent temperature also oscillates or
peaks. For the transient state (results shown in Fig. 4),
for most of the time the light emission is quite low com-
pared to the stable emission. In the peaks, however, the
emission goes up at all wavelengths but most in the ul-
traviolent and actually overshoots the stable emission.
At the same time the bubble is decreasing in size, the
inference being that the bubble is trying to burn oﬀ ni-
trogen and turn into an argon dominated bubble. Due
to the normalization with the known spectrum of an ar-
gon bubble, the prefactor is proportional to a product of
emitting surface area and duration of ﬂash. Exact knowl-
edge of these factors would be necessary for a complete
analysis. Unfortunately, both parameters would be very
hard to measure due to the short timescale involved. It
is clear though, that the lower the drive and the smaller
the bubble, the higher the apparent temperature. This
trend, also found for air-seeded bubbles, could be con-
nected with the presence of water vapor [8].

Although it is diﬃcult to get quantitative informa-
tion from this analysis, some interesting information arise
from assuming the bubble radius at the time of emis-
sion to be proportional to R0, with a proportionality
factor that is relatively independent of drive amplitude,
and plotting the prefactor as function of the radius R0
squared. In Fig. 5 we present this kind of plot for an os-
cillating state and a peaking state below the stable state,
the transient state, and a peaking state above the stable
state, together with an analysis for a type 1 state (air-
seeded) at a similar level of degassing for comparison. As
seen, in the case of pure nitrogen, the prefactors at small
ambient radii are proportional to R0
, but at higher val-

ues of the ambient radius saturation sets in. Naively one
could therefore interpret the slopes to be proportional
to the ﬂash duration. A tentative explanation for the
saturation could be that the actual volume of emission
is smaller [10, 11] than the actual bubble size. As the
apparent temperatures do not show much variation, this
interpretation is in fact relatively robust independent of
whether volume or surface emission is assumed. In fact
assuming volume emission would aggravate the problem
of reconciliating the changes in emission with the changes
in bubble size. We wish to stress that while the absolute
values of R0 and Pa are naturally questionable, the func-
tional dependences displayed in Figs. 4 & 5 are robust.
The result for the recycling state of an air-seeded bub-
ble is quite diﬀerent. The recycling is of type 1 but having
the hump that eventually results in type 2 recycling at
higher levels of applied sound pressure. For small bub-
ble radius, where the bubble according to our analysis of
recycling states is mostly an air bubble we ﬁnd the same
linear behavior as for the nitrogen bubble ending with
a trend towards saturation before the shrinking associ-
ated with the burn-oﬀ takes over. Finally we observe a
new linear increase associated with the continued argon
intake. Stable states are all located to the right of the
transient curves.

To conclude we have shown the possibility of obtaining
stable SBSL using non-noble gasses with total remove-
ment of noble gasses as a critical condition for stability.
The experiments conﬁrm the interpretation of the newly
found type 2 recycling mode as originating in incomplete
burn-oﬀ of diatomic gasses. The presence of stable emis-
sion is only permitted if the diﬀerent gasses are prohib-
ited from accumulating in the bubble. In the case of ni-
trogen, the only chemical processes possible involve water
vapor. This raises the intriguing question of whether the
stability could be caused by hydrogen actually accumu-

lating in the bubble. Such an accumulation is, however,
not possible for the stable oxygen seeded bubble where
the only possible reaction products are H2O2 and O3. It
is worth noting that the black body ﬁts give ≈ 8000 K
for nitrogen, and ≈ 6600 K for oxygen which could be
related to the known dissociation temperatures for these
diatomic molecules. Finally, gas depletion in a boundary
layer around the bubble might very well be an important
factor. Furthermore, both the apparent higher tempera-
tures for smaller bubbles and the saturation points to the
amount of water vapor being an important factor. Obvi-
ously an extension of the dissociation hypothesis also for
air-seeded bubbles at low drive and/or low content argon
is needed.

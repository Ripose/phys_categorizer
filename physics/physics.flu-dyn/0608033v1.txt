Abstract

The inﬂuence of polydispersity on the magnetization is analyzed in a nonequilibrium situation

where a cylindrical ferroﬂuid column is enforced to rotate with constant frequency like a rigid

body in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld that is applied perpendicular to the cylinder axis. Then,

the magnetization and the internal magnetic ﬁeld are not longer parallel to each other and their

directions diﬀer from that of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Experimental results on the transverse

magnetization component perpendicular to the applied ﬁeld are compared and analyzed as func-

tions of rotation frequency and ﬁeld strength with diﬀerent polydisperse Debye models that take

into account the polydispersity in diﬀerent ways and to a varying degree.

INTRODUCTION

2

The prospect of inﬂuencing the rotational dynamics of the nanoscaled magnetic particles

in a ferroﬂuid by a macroscopic ﬂow and/or by a magnetic ﬁeld in order to then observe the

resulting response via the magnetization and/or via changes in the ﬂow has been stimulating

many research activities [1, 2, 3, 4] ever since McTague measured [5] the so-called magneto-

viscous eﬀect. Of particular interest are in this context ﬂows that are shear free on the

macroscopic scale as in a ﬂuid that is rotating like a rigid body with a rotation frequency,

say, Ω = Ωez.

While the colloidal magnetic particles then undergo thermally sustained rotational and

translational Brownian motion on the microscopic scale they co-rotate in the mean with the

deterministic macroscopic rigid body ﬂow. However, this mean co-rotation can be hindered

by magnetic torques on their moments when a magnetic ﬁeld, say, H0 = H0ex is applied

perpendicular to the rotation axis ez of the ﬂow. The combination of the externally imposed

forcing of the particle motion by (i) the rigid body ﬂow in which they are ﬂoating and by

(ii) the magnetic torques on their magnetic moments drives the colloidal suspension out of

equilibrium. Concerning the magnetic moments, this forcing causes the mean orientation of

the moments, i.e., of the magnetization M of the ferroﬂuid to be no longer parallel to the

internal magnetic ﬁeld H. Instead, M is pushed out of the direction of H as well as of that of

H0 thereby acquiring a nonzero transverse component My. Here it should be noted that in a
long cylinder Maxwell’s equations imply the vector relation H = H0−M/2 between the three

ﬁelds when they are stationary and homogeneous but they need not be collinear. However,

in equilibrium, Ω = 0, the three ﬁelds are indeed collinear: the equilibrium magnetization

Meq(H) = Meq(H)H/H is parallel to the internal ﬁeld H.

Recently, the transverse magnetization My of a slender cylindrical column of ferroﬂuid

that was enforced to rotate like a rigid body with constant frequency Ωez in an applied

homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld H0ex was measured as a function of Ω and H0 [6]. These

measurements showed among others that the predictions [7] based on models for the mag-

netization dynamics [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] with a single relaxation time overestimate the magni-

tude of My. One reason for this discrepancy seems to be that particles with diﬀerent sizes

and diﬀerent rotational dynamics of their magnetic moments contribute diﬀerently to the

non-equilibrium, ﬂow-induced component My of the magnetization. In particular only the

February 2, 2008

magnetic moments of the larger particles in which the magnetic moments are blocked and

”frozen” in the particles, i.e., those with eﬀective Brownian relaxation dynamics may be

rotated by the ﬂow out of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Here we consider poly-disperse models with single-particle Brownian as well as N´eel

relaxation dynamics for the diﬀerent particle sizes. So we ignore the inﬂuence of any dipolar

magnetic interaction and of any ﬂow induced interaction on the (rotation) dynamics of the

particles. Thereby collective, collision dominated long-range and long-time hydrodynamic

relaxation dynamics of the ensemble of magnetic moments are discarded since only the

individual relaxation of each magnetic moment is considered — albeit in the collectively

generated internal magnetic ﬁeld H.

II. EQUILIBRIUM MAGNETIZATION

In our experiments we used several ferroﬂuids out of the APG-series of FerroTec. Their

saturation magnetization was speciﬁed by the manufacturer to be M F F
sat = 17507 A/m
(± 10%). This corresponds to a volume concentration φ ≈ 3.6% of the suspended mag-

netic material. We have measured the equilibrium magnetization of the ferroﬂuids with a

vibrating sample magnetometer (LakeShore 7300 VSM) with a commercial PC user pack-

age.

In order to get information on the particle size distribution of the ferroﬂuid under

investigation, we used ﬁts [13] with a lognormal form of the distribution as well as with

a regularization procedure [6] based on Tichonovs method [14]. Generally the equilibrium

magnetization M eq(H) as a function of the internal magnetic ﬁeld H can be approximated

by a superposition of Langevin-functions

M eq(H) =

wjL[αj(H)].

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup for measuring the magnetization of a rotating cylindrical column

of ferroﬂuid is sketched in Fig. 3. It is described in more detail in [6]. The ferroﬂuid is ﬁlled

into a cylindrical plexiglass sample holder with inside radius R = 3.2 mm. This radius is

so small that for our rotation frequencies the ferroﬂuid rotates as a rigid body with a ﬂow
ﬁeld u(r) = Ω × r = Ωreϕ. Here Ω is the externally enforced constant rotation rate of the

sample and eϕ is the unit vector in azimuthal direction. A homogeneous and temporally

constant magnetic ﬁeld H0 = H0ex is applied perpendicular to the cylinder axis ez. For

such a combination of enforced rotation and applied ﬁeld theoretical models allow for a

spatially and temporally constant nonequilibrium magnetization M that is pushed out of

the directions of H0 and H by the ﬂow.

According to the Maxwell equations the ﬁelds H and M within the ferroﬂuid are related

to each other via

for our long cylindrical sample and in particular Hy = −My/2 as indicated schematically in

Fig. 3. In addition they demand that the magnetic ﬁeld outside the ferroﬂuid cylinder

IV. MAGNETIZATION DYNAMICS OF A POLY-DISPERSE MODEL

Comparisons with experimental results showed [6] that theoretical predictions [7] based on

models [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] with a single relaxation time overestimate the magnitude of H sensor

.

y

One reason is that particles with diﬀerent sizes and diﬀerent rotational dynamics of their

magnetic moments contribute diﬀerently to the non-equilibrium, ﬂow-induced component

My of the magnetization and that in particular only the magnetic moments of the larger

particles with eﬀective Brownian relaxation dynamics may be rotated by the ﬂow out of the

direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Therefore, we consider here as a next step poly-disperse models with single-particle Brow-

nian and N´eel relaxation dynamics for the diﬀerent particle sizes. Such models have been

used [15] to determine within a linear response analysis the eﬀect of polydispersity on the

dynamics of a torsional ferroﬂuid pendulum that was periodically forced close to resonance

to undergo small amplitude oscillations in a rigid body ﬂow [16, 17].

We ignore the inﬂuence of any dipolar magnetic interaction and of any ﬂow induced inter-

action on the (rotation) dynamics of the particles. Thereby collective, collision dominated

long-range and long-time hydrodynamic relaxation dynamics of the ensemble of magnetic

moments are discarded since only the individual relaxation of each magnetic moment is

considered — albeit in the collectively generated internal magnetic ﬁeld H.

For numerical reasons we use a discrete partition of the particle size distribution. Then,

without interaction, the magnetization of the resulting mixture of mono-disperse ideal para-

magnetic gases is given by M =

Mj, where Mj denotes the magnetization of the particles

with diameter dj. We assume that each magnetic moment and with it each Mj obeys a simple

P

Debye relaxation dynamics that drives them in the absence of ﬂow towards their respective
equilibrium value Meq

j (H). Then, in the stationary situation resulting from the rigid body

Ω × Mj =

We should like to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that the magnetization

equations (4.1) for the diﬀerent particle sizes are coupled via the internal ﬁeld H: according
to Maxwell’s equations H = H0 − 1

times of about some 10−3s, while small particles have the much smaller N´eel relaxation times.

The boundary between N´eel and Brownian dominated relaxation as a function of particle

size d depends sensitively on the anisotropy constant K. This is documented in Fig. 4 for
the two values K = 15kJ/m3 and K = 50kJ/m3. For these speciﬁc examples the boundaries
between N´eel and Brownian dominated relaxation lie at about d ≃ 20nm and d ≃ 13nm,

respectively.

V. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

For the numerical calculations we take typical values for the ferroﬂuid APG 933 of Fer-

roTec that is used among others in the experiments described in [6]: M bulk

sat = 456kA/m,

February 2, 2008

7

η = 0.5P a s, s = 2nm, and f0 = 109Hz. Typical values of K lie between 10kJ/m3 and
50kJ/m3 [18, 19]. We furthermore use as input the experimental equilibrium magnetization

Meq(H) of APG 933 shown in Fig. 1 and the magnetic weights of Fig. 2 obtained with ﬁts

to a log-normal distribution or with a regularization method [6].

From the previous work [6, 7] we know that single-relaxation time (mono-disperse) models

predict the maximum of My resp. of H sensor
in the experiments [6] done with poly-disperse ferroﬂuids for frequencies up to Ω ≃ 3000rad/s
mainly the large particles contribute to My resp. to H sensor

since their magnetic moments

y

are eﬀectively frozen in the particle’s crystal lattice. Only these magnetic moments can

be pushed out of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld by the combined action of thermally

induced rotary Brownian motion and deterministic macroscopic ﬂow in the rotating cylinder.

Smaller particles can keep their moment aligned with the magnetic ﬁeld by the N´eel process

when these particles undergo rotational motion. Finally, the particle diameter that separates

N´eel behavior from Brownian behavior in the size distribution and that thereby determines

how many particles contribute to My resp.

to the experimental signal H sensor

depends

y

sensitively on the anisotropy constant K: The smaller K, the smaller is the number of

Brownian particles according to Fig. 4, and the smaller is My resp. H sensor

.

y

The above sketched physical picture is corroborated by Fig. 5. There we compare the

experimentally obtained H sensor

y

(Ω) (stars) as a function of Ω for a representative externally

applied ﬁeld H0 = 30kA/m with various model variants that take into account the poly-

dispersity to diﬀerent degrees. This is done for two diﬀerent anisotropy constants, namely,
K = 15kJ/m3 and K = 50kJ/m3 as representative examples. However, the three upper-

most curves refer to single time relaxation approximations, each with τ = 2ms [6]: the

dotted line with crosses is the result of a strictly monodisperse Debye model while the lines

with diamonds refer to polydisperse models, however, with common τj = τ = 2ms taken in

Eq. (4.1) but diﬀerent magnetic weights wj obtained either from a lognormal distribution

(full line with full diamonds) or from the regularization method (dashed line with open dia-

monds). The equilibrium magnetization Meq(H) was taken to be the experimental one, the

distributions were obtained from this experimental Meq(H) by the lognormal ansatz resp.

the regularization method. This, ﬁrst of all, shows that models with only one relaxation

time show roughly the same behavior of My(Ω) irrespective of whether the particle size and

magnetic moment distributions are polydisperse or not.

February 2, 2008

The set of curves with circles and squares in Fig. 5 refer to truly polydisperse models,
eqs. (4.1 - 4.3), but diﬀerent anisotropy constants of the magnetic material [K = 50kJ/m3
(circles), K = 15kJ/m3 (squares)]. Again, full lines with full symbols were obtained with a

lognormal distribution while dashed lines with open symbols refer to a distribution resulting

from the regularization method. Here, one sees that these two distributions with their

magnetic weights displayed in Fig. 2 yield very similar results which might not be surprising

in view of the fact that both seem to reproduce Meq(H) adequately.

The largest and most important diﬀerence between the curves with diamonds (i.e., the

single-time models) and the curves with circles and squares (i.e., the genuine polydisperse

models) come from the diﬀerence in the anisotropy constants of the magnetic material

that governs how many particles contribute eﬃciently as Brownian ones to the transverse

magnetization My resp. to H sensor

y

: for smaller K the magnetic moments of fewer particles

being Brownian ones may be rotated out of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld by the ﬂow

in the cylinder.

The curves for K = 15kJ/m3 yield roughly the same maximal size H sensor

as the exper-

y

iments — they could be ﬁne-tuned even further. But then the location, Ωmax(H0), of the

maxima for diﬀerent H0 is still oﬀ from the experimental ones as shown in Fig. 6(a) and 7(b).

However, the agreement between the predictions of the polydisperse models of eqs. (4.1 -

4.3) and the experiments concerning the location Ωmax(H0) can be improved by allowing

the relaxation rates τj of the diﬀerently sized particles to depend also on the internal ﬁeld

H. To demonstate this, we use for simplicity the form [6]

τ γ
j (H) = τj

2L(γH)
γH − L(γH)

(5.1)

with one additional ﬁt parameter γ. Values of about γ ∼ 10−4m/A yield maximum locations
Ωmax(H0) that agree well with the experiments as can be seen in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 7(b).

This generalization of the model (4.1 - 4.3) leaves the peak value H sensor

(Ωmax) almost

y

unchanged, cf, Fig. 7(a).

However, also this augmented polydispersive model reproduces with ﬁxed values of K

and γ the experimental data only in a small range of Ω and H0, cf, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.

VI. CONCLUSION

9

We have compared the predictions of polydisperse models of the magnetization dynamics

of ferroﬂuids with recent experiments measuring the transverse magnetization component

My of a rotating ferroﬂuid cylinder. The models use mixtures of mono-disperse ideal param-

agnetic gases of diﬀerently sized particles. The magnetization dynamics of the models take

into account the rigid body rotation of the ﬂuid combined with a simple Debye relaxation

of the magnetic moments of each particle with size dependent Brownian and N´eel magnetic

relaxation times. Thus, in the absence of ﬂow, each magnetic moment and with it each

sub-magnetization would be driven independently of the others towards its respective mean

equilibrium value that, however, depends on the internal magnetic ﬁeld H being collectively

generated by all magnetic moments.

The comparison suggests that mainly the large particles contribute to My since their

magnetic moments are eﬀectively frozen in the particle’s crystal lattice. Only these magnetic

moments can be pushed eﬀectively out of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld by the combined

action of thermally induced rotary Brownian motion and deterministic macroscopic ﬂow in

the rotating cylinder. Smaller particles can keep their moment aligned with the magnetic

ﬁeld by the N´eel process when these particles undergo rotational motion.

Finally, the particle diameter that separates N´eel behavior from Brownian behavior in the

size distribution and that thereby determines how many particles contribute to My resp. to

the experimental signal H sensor

y

depends quite sensitively on the anisotropy constant K of the

magnetic material. K determines how many magnetic moments are ”frozen” or ”blocked”

in particles and thus can be rotated by the rigid body ﬂow: The smaller K, the smaller is

the number of Brownian particles with frozen moments, and the smaller is the resulting My.

Or, vice versa, a large transverse magnetization can be expected in ferroﬂuids with large

anisotropy constants.

An analysis of the rotation rates Ωmax(H0) for which My is largest indicates that the

agreement between experiments and model predictions can be improved by allowing the

relaxation rates of the diﬀerently sized particles to depend also on the magnetic ﬁeld H.

(Ωmax) (a) and location of the maximum

Ωmax (b) as functions of the external ﬁeld H0. Stars show experimental data. Lines refer to the
results of polydisperse models with a lognormal distribution and K = 15kJ/m3: H-independent
relaxation times (solid); H–dependencies with γ = 0.8·10−4m/A (dotted), γ = 10−4m/A (dashed),
and γ = 1.1 · 10−4m/A (dot-dashed). In (a) the diﬀerences between the lines are too small to be

seen.

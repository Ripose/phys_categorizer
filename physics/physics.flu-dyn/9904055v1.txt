Many important discoveries in physics this century originate from the research of wave prop-

agation in periodic structures [1]. An exciting example is the discovery of what is called wave

band structures [2], asserted by Bloch theorem. Of special importance is the appearance of the

complete band gaps in strong scattering structures. In the gaps, the system has no propaga-

tion modes and waves decay exponentially in any direction, rendering applications such as in

noise screening and laser devices. Band structures or complete band gaps have been observed or

predicted for electromagnetic waves in periodic dielectric structures [3,4], and only recently for

acoustic waves [5–8] and hydrodynamic waves [9].

We have considered the acoustic band structures in a periodic two-dimensional system. Here

we show that not only a complete band gap may be achieved, but an interesting collective

behavior may appear in such a system. Place uniform air-cylinders of radius a in parallel to

form a square lattice in water perpendicular to the x

y plane; thus the cylinders are parallel

−

to the z-axis in the setting. The fraction of area occupied by the cylinders per unit area is

β; thus the lattice constant d is (π/β)1/2a. Due to the large contrast in acoustic impedance

between water and air, the air-cylinders are strong acoustic scatterer, and because of this the

complete gap is relatively easy to realize. The scattering function of one of such cylinders can

be readily computed in the form of a modal series solution, having a resonance scattering peak

near ka = 0.005.

The band structure in the system is presented in Fig. 1(a), for which the cylinder concentration

β is taken as 10−3 and the frequency is written in terms of the non-dimensional parameter ka. A

complete band gap appears between around ka = 0.007 and 0.032, somewhat above the resonance

peak of a single cylinder. The complete gap is found to be stable against small distortions of

the lattice structure. The width of the gap, however, diminishes as the cylinder concentration β

decreases. Fig. 1(b), showing the dependence of the width on β, indicates that the gap disappears

when β drops below 10−5. While the low band edge does not change much as β varies, the higher

edge seems to increase exponentially with β in the range of frequencies considered.

To investigate what happens to the cylinders when the complete gap occurs, a novel diagram

method is used to characterize the behavior of the cylinders themselves. Suppose that a unit

line source, transmitting monochromatic waves, is located at the center of the array of the

2

cylinders and aligned parallel to the cylinders. The transmitted waves are multiply scattered by

the cylinders, causing the scattering characteristics of the scatterers to change. The scattered

wave from each cylinder is a response to all incident waves consisting of the direct wave from

the source and the scattered waves from the other cylinders. The total wave, a measure of the

transmitted energy, will be the summation of the direct wave and all the scattered waves at

any spatial point. Driving by the source and the scattered waves, the surface of each cylinder

vibrates. Invoking usual boundary conditions at the air-water interface, the surface vibration

can be computed rigorously by the self-consistent method [10] and the matrix inversion [11].

Express the surface vibration for a cylinder, the i-th cylinder say, as

ejθi, with j =

|

1 and i = 1, 2, . . .. In the range of frequencies concerned, the pulsating mode of vibration

√

−

dominates. The modulus

represents the vibration magnitude, and θi is the phase. Assign

Ai|

|

a unit vector ~ui, hereafter termed phase vector, to associate with each phase θi such that ~ui =

cos θi~ex + sin θi~ey. Setting the phase of the source to zero, numerical experiments are carried out

to study the behavior of the phase vectors of the cylinders and the spatial distribution of the

acoustic energy.

Three transmitted frequencies are chosen to be below, inside and above the complete band

gap respectively. The results are presented in Fig. 2. We observe that for frequencies outside

the gap, there is no ordering for the phase vectors and the energy distribution is extended. The

more variations in the case of ka = 0.006 than that of ka = 0.034 imply the stronger multiple

scattering in the system. Inside the gap, an ordering in the phase vectors appears, that is, all

cylinders are oscillating completely in phase, but exactly out of phase with the transmitting

source. Meanwhile, the energy is trapped near the source and rapidly decays in all directions,

in accordance with the evanescent mode of the cylinder lattice. The results indicate that the

collective behavior of the cylinders are associated with the complete band gap. Such out-of-phase

coherence allows for eﬀective cancellation of wave propagation.

cylinders are considered in the computation. In the plot of the energy distribution, the

geometrical spreading factor has been removed. Note that in the case of ka = 0.01 there

are a few phase vectors which do not point to the same direction as the others because

of the eﬀect of the ﬁnite boundary; when the cylinder number goes to inﬁnity, this eﬀect

disappears.

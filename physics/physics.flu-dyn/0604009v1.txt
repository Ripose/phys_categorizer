(Received ?? and in revised form ??)

It has hitherto been widely considered that a mixing layer is unstable at all Reynolds

numbers. However this is untenable from energy considerations, which demand that there

must exist a non-zero Reynolds number below which disturbances cannot extract energy

from the mean ﬂow. It is shown here that a linear stability analysis of similarity solutions

of the plane mixing layer, including the eﬀects of ﬂow non-parallelism, using the minimal

composite theory and the properties of adjoints following Govindarajan & Narasimha (2005),

resolves the issue by yielding non-zero critical Reynolds numbers for coﬂowing streams of

any velocity ratio. The critical Reynolds number so found, based on the vorticity thick-

ness and the velocity diﬀerential as scales, varies in the narrow range of 59 to 55 as the

velocity ratio goes from zero to unity.

1. Introduction

The motivation for the present work arises from an analysis of the stability of a mixing

layer due to Betchov & Szewczyk (1963). This analysis, based on the Orr–Sommerfeld

(OS) equation, showed that the neutral curve in the wave-number (α) – Reynolds number

(Re) plane approaches the origin α = 0 as Re goes to 0, leading the authors to conclude

“No minimum [i.e. critical] Reynolds number is found” for the ﬂow. Mixing layers have

been studied extensively since, and recent texts, e.g. Huerre & Rossi (1998, pp. 81–294),

Criminale et al. (2003, p. 90) and Drazin & Reid (2004, p. 199–201), still report the crit-

ical Reynolds number as zero. This is intriguing, for several early studies of stability

(e.g. Prandtl (1935, pp. 178–183), Lin (1955, pp. 31–32, 59+), going back to the two-

dimensional analysis of Lorentz (1907, pp. 43–71)), show that (under certain reasonable

conditions) a two-dimensional incompressible viscous ﬂow must be stable at suﬃciently

low Reynolds numbers. Astonishingly, however, there is no analysis in the extensive lit-

erature on hydrodynamic stability that yields a non-zero value for this critical Reynolds

number. The mixing layer being a very basic ﬂow type, the absence of any deﬁnitive

commentary on the above issue has led other studies of ﬂows modelled on the mixing

layer (e.g. Solomon, Holloway & Swinney 1993; ¨Ostekin, Cumbo & Liakopoulos 1999)

to base their analyses on the assumption that the critical Reynolds number is zero.

Now all analyses of mixing layer stability, from Esch (1957) to Balsa (1987), start with

the OS equation, which is valid only for strictly parallel ﬂow. However, the width of a

laminar mixing layer scales as x1/2 (where x is the streamwise distance), so the rate of

change of thickness (and hence also any parameter measuring the degree of ﬂow non-

parallelism) becomes inﬁnite in the limit of x (equivalently Re) going to 0. In other

words, existing studies are based on the assumption of no non-parallelism in a situation

where any measure of non-parallelism would be inﬁnite. Thus ﬂow non-parallelism may

be expected to play a crucial role in determining the stability characteristics in the

limit. Though Bun & Criminale (1994) note that “with viscous eﬀects, the basic ﬂow

should be treated as non-parallel”, and other texts (e.g. Drazin & Reid 2004, p.197)

emphasize that “at small values of Reynolds number the parallel-ﬂow assumption is of

Stability of a laminar mixing layer

questionable validity”, no investigation accounts for the non-parallelism. We show here

that a consistent non-parallel ﬂow theory yields ﬁnite, non-zero critical Reynolds numbers

based on vorticity thickness and velocity diﬀerential in the range 55 to 59 depending on

the velocity ratio.

In a departure from earlier work, the similarity solution of the laminar mixing layer is

used as the base ﬂow everywhere in the present analysis. The earlier studies, beginning

with ones that assumed zero viscosity, have moved from the discontinuous proﬁle due to

Helmholtz to the hyperbolic tangent proﬁle considered by Betchov & Szewczyk (1963).

Examples of other approximations appear in Esch (1957), and all later studies to our

knowledge use one of these. The similarity proﬁle is a better approximation of reality

than any of the above, and its use through what we have called minimal composite theory

is both appropriate and convenient in the present approach.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In § 2 the similarity solution of the mean

ﬂow proﬁle is presented and some remarks follow. The stability problem is posed and

the method of solution brieﬂy outlined in § 3, essentially following the approach used for

boundary layers by Govindarajan & Narasimha (1997, 2005). In § 4, the results of the

stability analysis are presented and compared with earlier work.

2. Similarity solution of the basic ﬂow

A plane incompressible mixing layer that develops in the positive x-direction is consid-

ered. The two free-streams ﬂow with velocities U∞ and λU∞ (with λ < 1) before coming

into contact with each other at the origin (x = 0). Both streams are semi-inﬁnite in their

lateral (y) extent. We omit the case of counterﬂowing streams (λ < 0) from the present

discussion, since they are not relevant to the non-parallel ﬂow theories. Since no other

4

external length scale is present in the problem as formulated, after a suﬃcient distance

from the origin similarity may be taken to be valid.

Henceforth all variables subscripted by d are dimensional quantities. The streamwise

coordinate and the coordinate in the direction normal to the ﬂow are xd and yd re-

spectively, and ν is the kinematic viscosity. The similarity analysis here diﬀers from

Schlichting & Gersten (2004, pp. 175–176) only in the deﬁnition of the length scale ld in

the direction normal to the ﬂow,

The third boundary condition has been a subject of some controversy. As formulated

above, it is derived from matching the pressure across the mixing region, following

Ting (1959). The zero net transverse force condition suggested by von Karman (1921)

results in an identical third boundary condition. Klemp & Acrivos (1972) pointed out an

inconsistency in the above formulation and showed that this condition is still incomplete,

and further that it cannot be resolved within the context of classical boundary layer

theory. Using a diﬀerent approach to formulate asymptotic expansions to solutions of

the Navier–Stokes equations, Alston & Cohen (1992) have however argued that this con-

dition remains the best option compared to the other alternatives used in the literature.

The velocity proﬁles obtained for diﬀerent values of λ are shown in ﬁgure 1. Apart from

the displacement of the dividing streamline in the negative y direction, these solutions

are identical to those obtained ﬁrst by Lock (1951). The result for the half jet, i.e. for

λ = 0, was validated against that given in Schlichting & Gersten (2004, pp. 175–176).

A suitably transformed hyperbolic tangent function is superimposed on the similarity

proﬁle for λ = 0 for comparison.

Note that for every ﬂow conﬁguration with a λ in the range 0 to 1, there corresponds

an identical but vertically ﬂipped ﬂow with velocity ratio 1/λ. So it is expected that the

similarity solution becomes increasingly symmetric about the x axis as λ approaches 1.

with appropriately transformed boundary conditions. Writing (1−λ) as a small parameter

ǫ and assuming a solution in the form of an asymptotic series in powers of ǫ,

f = f0 + ǫf1 + ǫ2f2 + (higher order terms),

we get the streamwise velocity correct to second order in ǫ as

(cid:19)(cid:27)

While such analytically expressible proﬁles are ubiquitous in the literature, our purpose

is to demonstrate that the similarity solution smoothly merges into the error-function

proﬁle for λ close to 1. It is therefore not expected (as we shall conﬁrm shortly) that

the stability characteristics change very much between these choices. This puts into

perspective one of the nuances of our analysis that is diﬀerent from existing ones, for it

must be emphasized that the marked deviation observed in the ﬁnal result is not to be

attributed to the diﬀerences in the assumed velocity proﬁles but to the non-parallel ﬂow

analysis.

3. The non-parallel stability problem

A brief outline of the minimal composite theory is described in what follows. A review

of the method can be found in Narasimha & Govindarajan (2000).

Each ﬂow quantity, for example the streamfunction, is expressed as the sum of a mean

Φd and a perturbation ˆφd, where

with the (complex) phase speed of the disturbance c = ω/α. Inserting these into the

Navier–Stokes equations for two-dimensional incompressible ﬂow written in terms of

the streamfunction, and retaining all terms nominally upto O(Re −1

), the non-parallel

stability equation can be written as

N {φ} = 0,

with boundary conditions φ, Dφ → 0

speciﬁc, and so is diﬀerent e.g. from that for the boundary layer (see below). Following

Govindarajan & Narasimha (1997) the non-parallel operator N is expressed as the sum

of an operator M that contains all the lowest order terms and an operator H comprising

the higher order terms,

8

The relative order of magnitude of each individual term varies with y because of the

presence of the critical layer at Φ′ = c. While constructing the minimal composite

equation that yields results correct upto O(Re −1

), the order of magnitude of any term

within the y-domain is considered. The ﬁnal equation consists of all terms that are

at least O(Re −1

) somewhere, and rejects all that are o(Re −1

) everywhere in the do-

main. It must be emphasized that the above equations are diﬀerent from those in

Govindarajan & Narasimha (2005), which were formulated for a boundary layer. For

instance, in the construction of the operator M for the present case clearly no wall layer

considerations are needed. Furthermore, the term pΦD3, being of higher order everywhere

in the mixing layer, is in the operator H, whereas in the boundary layer it is part of M.

The solution procedure for estimating the growth of the disturbance, though, remains

the same, and is given in that paper in detail. For reference, we recapitulate some of its

essential points below.

It is instructive to note that though the non-parallel operator has partial derivatives

in both x and y, the lowest order terms (comprising M) contain derivatives only in y.

Taking this as a cue, the total solution φ is expressed in two parts,

φ(x, y) = A(x)φm(x, y) + ǫφh(x, y).

(3.4)

Here A(x) is the amplitude function that captures the streamwise variation of the lowest

order solution φm, which satisﬁes the equation

M{φm} = 0.

(3.5)

We consider the downstream growth of disturbances at a constant value of the similarity

variable y. For future reference, we also deﬁne a complex eﬀective wavenumber associated

with the non-dimensional streamwise disturbance velocity ˆu as

where αi is the imaginary part of the full complex wavenumber α. We ﬁnd that, in general,

a disturbance may amplify at one y and decay at another. Moreover, one disturbance

quantity could be amplifying while others decay. The derivative of φm with respect to x is

obtained by solving (3.5) for a nearby Re and noting that ∂/∂x = p∂/∂Re. Substituting

from (3.4) into (3.3), and noting that N = M + H, we obtain the amplitude evolution

ing the property of adjoints (cf. Govindarajan & Narasimha 2005), the contribution to

the growth g due to change in the amplitude function, i.e. the quantity (1/A)dA/dx, is

calculated without the need to speciﬁcally compute the higher order solution φh. Equa-

Now A ∼ O(1) and dA/dx is O(Re −1

), so the error in the estimation of the growth

rate will be o(Re −1

). But as we integrate over a large streamwise distance of O(Re), the

error in the amplitude is expected to be o(1). Here, a solution of the partial diﬀerential

10

equation (3.3) to the desired order of accuracy has been obtained by solving a parametric

ordinary diﬀerential equation and using the property of adjoints. An obvious advantage

is that the complexity of the problem is signiﬁcantly reduced when compared to the

exercise of solving it as a full partial diﬀerential equation.

4. Results

4.1. Accuracy of results

Both the parallel and non-parallel stability analyses involve solving an eigenvalue prob-

lem. The conditions at inﬁnity are posed at distances suﬃciently far away to ensure that

results are independent of the size of the domain. For example, on the curve of marginal

stability, the Reynolds number for a given α is required to be identical up to the ﬁfth

decimal place before any further increase in domain size is considered unnecessary. We

notice that at large y, Φ′′′ vanishes and the higher derivatives of the eigenfunction with re-

spect to y (appearing in the viscous term) become smaller. Therefore, as an estimate, the

eigenfunction decays as exp(±αy), i.e. its e-folding rate depends on the wavenumber of

the disturbance. The y-domain thus needs to be larger for smaller wavenumbers. Further,

since the eigenfunctions are discretized as eigenvectors, a suﬃcient number of grid-points

must be contained in the domain so that the results are independent of resolution.

Now, an increase in the number of grid-points directly increases the size of the matrices

involved in the eigenvalue problem and this aﬀects the computational eﬀort adversely. For

non-dimensional wavenumbers larger than 0.2, we impose outer boundary conditions at

y = ±20 and use 81 grid-points with a sinh grid-stretching. For the smallest wavenumbers

considered (α ≃ 0.02) the conditions at inﬁnity are imposed at y = ±300 with 150 grid-

points. Intermediate values were taken to expedite the solution process whenever this

did not aﬀect the accuracy above a tolerance level of ﬁve signiﬁcant digits. There is

thus a lower cut-oﬀ for the real part of the wavenumber in our results, beyond which

Stability of a laminar mixing layer

11

obtaining numerically accurate results becomes prohibitively expensive computationally.

The neutral boundary is deﬁned where the imaginary part of the eigenvalue ω and the

growth rate g are smaller than 1 × 10−8 and 1 × 10−6 in magnitude respectively. In

calculating the streamwise derivatives, nearby stations are taken corresponding to values

of Reynolds number Re apart by 1% of the value at either of these points. Independence

of the curve of marginal stability to small deviations in the numerical value of this

parameter has also been conﬁrmed.

4.2. Parallel vs. non-parallel analysis

As mentioned before, the non-parallel approach is expected to deviate signiﬁcantly from

the parallel approach in the region where the Reynolds number based on streamwise

distance is small.

First, as validation of the OS solver used, we compare the results of the present analysis

on the hyperbolic tangent proﬁle (the case of counterﬂowing streams with λ = −1) with

those of Betchov & Szewczyk (1963) in ﬁgure 2. Secondly, we establish that the result

showing the ﬂow to be unstable at Re = 0 is not speciﬁc to a counterﬂow situation,

rather it is inherent in the parallel ﬂow assumption. Curves of marginal stability from

a parallel analysis on the similarity proﬁles for the velocity ratios 0 and 0.5 are also

plotted in ﬁgure 2. These are compared with those from a parallel analysis on a suitably

transformed hyperbolic tangent proﬁle.

Note that while the similarity solution has a well-deﬁned length scale (2.1) associated

with it, the hyperbolic tangent proﬁle may be arbitrarily scaled. For the results shown

in ﬁgure 2, the hyperbolic tangent function used is so transformed that its vorticity

thickness (4.2) is identical to that of the similarity solution for the corresponding veloc-

ity ratio. We note that all the curves approach the origin, irrespective of whether the

hyperbolic tangent or the similarity proﬁle is used.

Next, the results of the parallel and non-parallel analyses are compared in ﬁgure 3 for

the four velocity ratios 0.0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. The results correspond to the respective

similarity proﬁles. The relevant quantity on the vertical axis for the results of the parallel

analysis is the physical wavenumber α, whereas for the non-parallel analysis it is the real

part of the eﬀective wavenumber αeﬀ deﬁned in (3.6).

Apart from the terms already present in the OS equation, the non-parallel operator

N includes further terms that essentially provide a correction at low Re. It is expected

that the diﬀerence between the parallel and non-parallel approaches diminishes in the

limit Re → ∞. Figure 3 shows that the curves of marginal stability, from both parallel

and non-parallel analyses, do indeed approach the neutrally stable mode of the solution

to Rayleigh’s equation for each of the velocity ratios considered above. Note that the

curves for λ = 0 have been plotted with Re on a log scale to show that the results are

indistinguishable as Re → ∞; but diﬀerences are noticeable even at Re = 103!

From § 3 it is evident that the curve of marginal stability and hence the critical

Reynolds number can vary depending on the y value at which the growth rate g is

determined. The monitoring location makes a huge diﬀerence to the stability result in

the case of boundary layers (Govindarajan & Narasimha 1997). But for the present ﬂow

the contribution from the last term in g is smooth in y. The critical Re ∗

(4.1) was ob-

served to vary within a range that was about 10% of the value of the critical Re ∗

at

14

y = 0 while traversing from y = −1.0 to y = 0.5. We do not expect any widely diﬀerent

behaviour outside this range as the variation in the velocity proﬁle becomes negligible.

It is also interesting to note that the minimum of the critical Reynolds numbers for any

given velocity ratio seems to occur close to the y-location where the streamwise velocity

proﬁle has the maximum slope (see ﬁgure 1). With y rescaled with respect to the vorticity

thickness, for the four velocity ratios considered, the location of minimum critical Re ∗

deviates most from the location of maximum slope for λ = 0.25 (by 0.019 units) and the

least for λ = 0 (by 0.001 units). All the results from the non-parallel analysis presented

in this paper correspond to a monitoring location ﬁxed at y = 0.

4.3. Critical Reynolds numbers

The variation of critical Reynolds number Re with velocity ratio is shown in ﬁgure 4. A

more appropriate Reynolds number in the present ﬂow would be one deﬁned in terms of

the velocity diﬀerence and the vorticity thickness,

The variation of critical Re ∗

tonically with λ and approaches a ﬁnite limiting value of 55.3 as λ goes to 1. Also, the

variation of critical Re ∗

with λ is found to be much less than the variation in critical Re.

5. Conclusions

The main result of the present work is the demonstration of the existence of a non-

zero critical Reynolds number for a laminar plane incompressible mixing layer. Choosing

the vorticity thickness and velocity diﬀerential as length and velocity scales, this critical

Reynolds number varies in the narrow range from 58.6 at λ = 0 to 55.3 at λ = 1. The

present result puts into perspective the prevalent understanding of linear stability of

the mixing layer. It also underlines the relevance of a non-parallel analysis vis-a-vis a

parallel one in regard to this ﬂow and other open ﬂows exhibiting a high degree of non-

parallelism. This is a striking example of a ﬂow where the use of non-parallel theory is

essential to avoid drawing incorrect physical conclusions. Though parallel ﬂow theory has

given revealing insights to instability mechanisms for over a century, there are regimes

of ﬂow where this theory is qualitatively wrong.

The ﬁnding of a critical Reynolds number which is not too low has an appealing

consequence. The laminar similarity ﬂow analysed here is physically realizable only at

some distance downstream of the splitter plate, and the results may therefore be veriﬁed

experimentally or by direct numerical simulations. This is not possible for the earlier

parallel ﬂow results. We note that since the ﬂow is convectively stable below Re ∗

= 55,

the question of absolute instability below this Reynolds number does not arise. While

it is outside the thrust of the present work, it is relevant to mention that for inviscid

ﬂow, from a parallel analysis, it is well established (Huerre & Monkewitz 1985) that the

instability is convective for any mixing layer formed by coﬂowing streams.

We also claim that for the purpose of stability analysis, the dependence of results on

the exact velocity proﬁle is weak, the form suﬃces to obtain results to a consistently

good accuracy. For all the non-parallel, parallel and inviscid analyses carried out on the

similarity proﬁles, the results diﬀer from corresponding analyses on the (suitably rescaled)

hyperbolic tangent proﬁles by no more than 5%. This is in contrast to wall-bounded shear

ﬂows where the stability results are very sensitive to the mean-ﬂow velocity proﬁle.

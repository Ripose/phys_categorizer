Abstract

The linear stability of a rotating, stratiﬁed, inviscid horizontal plane Couette ﬂow in a channel is
studied in the limit of strong rotation and stratiﬁcation. Two dimensionless parameters characterize
the ﬂow: the Rossby number ǫ, deﬁned as the ratio of the shear to the Coriolis frequency and assumed
small, and the ratio s of the Coriolis frequency to the buoyancy frequency, assumed to satisfy s ≤ 1.
An energy argument is used to show that unstable perturbations must have large, O(ǫ
) wavenumbers.
This motivates the use of a WKB-approach which, in the ﬁrst instance, provides an approximation for
the dispersion relation of the various waves that can propagate in the ﬂow. These are Kelvin waves,
trapped near the channel walls, and inertia-gravity waves with or without turning points.

−1

Although, the wave phase speeds are found to be real to all algebraic orders in ǫ, we establish that the
ﬂow is unconditionally unstable. This is the result of linear resonances between waves with oppositely
signed wave momenta. Three modes of instabilities are identiﬁed, corresponding to the resonance between
(i) a pair of Kelvin waves, (ii) a Kelvin wave and an inertia-gravity wave, and (iii) a pair of inertia-gravity
waves. Whilst all three modes of instability are active when the Couette ﬂow is anticyclonic, mode (iii)
is the only possible instability mechanism when the ﬂow is cyclonic.

We derive asymptotic estimates for the instability growth rates. These are exponentially small in ǫ,
of the form Im ω = a exp(−Ψ/ǫ) for some positive constants a and Ψ. For the Kelvin-wave instabilities
(i), we obtain analytic expressions for a and Ψ; the maximum growth rate, in particular, corresponds
to Ψ = 2. For the other types of instabilities, we make the simplifying assumption s ≪ 1 and ﬁnd that
Ψ = 2.80 for (ii) and Ψ = π for (iii). The asymptotic results are conﬁrmed by numerical computations.
These reveal, in particular, that the instabilities (iii) have much smaller growth rates in cyclonic ﬂows
than in anticyclonic ﬂows, in spite of having both Ψ = π.

Our results, which extend those of Kushner et al. (1998) and Yavneh et al. (2001), highlight the
limitations of the so-called balanced models, widely used in geophysical ﬂuid dynamics, which ﬁlter out
Kelvin and inertia-gravity waves and hence predict the stability of the Couette ﬂow. They are also
relevant to the stability of Taylor–Couette ﬂows and of astrophysical accretion discs.

Rapid rotation and strong density stratiﬁcation characterise the dynamics of geophysical ﬂuids, the atmo-
sphere and the oceans in particular. Two dimensionless numbers are used to measure the importance of
these two eﬀects relative to nonlinear advection: the Rossby number

Figure 1: Schematic of the Couette ﬂow, with velocity (Λy, 0, 0), of a three-dimensional Bousinesq ﬂuid with
constant Brunt–V¨ais¨al¨a frequency N . The domain rotates around the (vertical) z-axis at rate f /2; it is
unbounded in the x and z directions, and bounded in the y directions by two rigid walls at a distance 2L.

number estimates the maximum ratio between the typical frequency of the (slow) advective motion (given by
U/L), and the frequency of inertia-gravity waves (bounded from below by f ). Its smallness, explicity ǫ
1,
has an important dynamical consequence, namely the weakness of the interaction between advective motion
and inertia-gravity waves. This, together with the observation that inertia-gravity waves have generally
weak amplitudes in the atmosphere and oceans, has led to development — and success — of the so-called
balanced models, which ﬁlter out inertia-gravity waves completely. These models describe only the slow,
large-scale dynamics, termed balanced because of its closeness to hydrostatic and geostrophic balance. They
can be derived asymptotically, using power-series expansions in ǫ, and in principle can achieve an arbitrary
algebraic accuracy O(ǫn) (e.g., Warn 1997, Warn et al. 1995).

≪

To understand balanced dynamics and its limitations more fully, it is important to identify and quantify
the phenomena that balanced models fail to capture. Of particular interest are those unbalanced phenomena
which occur in spite of the smallness of ǫ and cannot be suppressed by balancing the initial data. In the
present paper we consider one such mechanism, namely the instability of balanced ﬂows to unbalanced,
gravity-wave-like perturbations. Since this type of instability is absent from balanced models of arbitrary
high accuracy (which all have qualitively similar stability conditions; see Ren & Shepherd 1997), the growth
rates can be expected to be o(ǫn) for all n
1 or, in other words, to be beyond all orders in ǫ, and typically
exponentially small in ǫ. Our results conﬁrm this scaling and show that the instability bands, i.e., the range
of unstable wavenumbers, are exponentially narrow.

≥

We note that unbalanced instabilities like the one examined in this paper are distinct from the mechanism
of spontaneous generation of inertia-gravity waves sudied in Vanneste & Yavneh (2004). Both mechanisms
are exponentially weak, but whilst the exponentially small quantity is the growth rate for instabilities, it
is the amplitude of the waves in the case of spontaneous generation. This diﬀerence may not be essential,
however, if the unbalanced instabilities saturate at a level that decreases to zero with growth rate, as is
typical. Another diﬀerence is the fact that the instabilities require an initial unbalanced perturbation,
whilst spontaneous generation occurs from entirely balanced initial conditions. We emphasize that both
mechanisms provide potential sources of inertia-gravity waves in the atmosphere and oceans. What the
exponential smallness indicates in both cases is that the eﬀectiveness of these sources is highly sensitive to
the Rossby number.

The speciﬁc ﬂow whose stability we study is a horizontal Couette ﬂow with velocity (Λy, 0, 0), modelled
using the Boussinesq approximation with constant N , and an f -channel of width 2L. See Figure 1 for an
illustration. A natural deﬁnition of a (signed) Rossby number for this ﬂow is the ratio

ǫ =

Λ
f

2

of (minus) the basic-ﬂow vorticity to the planetary vorticity. For ǫ > 0 (< 0), the shear is anticyclonic
(cyclonic). The other dimensionless parameter characterising the ﬂow can be taken to be the Prandlt ratio

s =

f
N

.

≤

≪

We restrict our attention to s

1 and note that in the atmosphere and oceans s

1 generally holds.

Because it is steady, the ﬂow under consideration remains exactly balanced for all times, unlike generic
time-dependent ﬂows. Furthermore, it is stable in any balanced approximation, however accurate: this
is because the shear is linear, and hence the potential vorticity constant, whilst balanced instabilities are
inﬂectional instabilities,which require changes in the sign of the potential-vorticity gradient. Thus, with this
ﬂow, there are none of the diﬃculties in separating inertia-gravity waves from balanced motion that would
appear for more complicated ﬂows, and the analysis reduces to a straighforward linear stability analysis.
The smallness of ǫ is of course exploited to derive asymptotic results.

A number of authors have investigated gravity-wave-like instabilities of shear ﬂows, although mostly in
the context of two-dimensional (shallow-water or compressible-gas) models, in either parallel or cylindrical
geometry (Satomura 1981a,b, 1982, Narayan et al. 1987, Knessl & Keller 1992, Ford 1994, Balmforth 1996,
Dritschel & Vanneste 2006), and of isentropic models (Papaloizou & Pringle 1987, and references therein).
1 and F = O(ǫ)
The emphasis was not, however, on the small ǫ limit; indeed, in shallow water, ﬂows with ǫ
are linearly stable as Ripa’s theorem indicates (Ripa 1983). In contrast, the three-dimensional model exam-
ined here turns out to be always unstable, with growing modes whose horizontal and vertical wavenumbers
scale like ǫ−1. Our analysis has nevertheless many common features with some of the works cited above, in
particular the use of the WKB approximation. A common theme (in particular with Narayan et al. 1987)
is also the interpretation of the instabilities in terms of (linear) resonances between modes with diﬀerently
signs of the conserved wave energy (or pseudoenergy) and wave momentum (or pseudomomentum) (see, e.g.,
Craik 1985, Ripa 1990, and references therein).

≪

In the presence of lateral boundaries, as is the case here, there are two types of unbalanced modes: inertia-
gravity waves, which are oscillatory in the cross-stream direction, and Kelvin waves, which are trapped at each
boundary. Instabilities involving the resonance of Kelvin waves have been studied recently by Kushner et al.
(1998) for the model considered here, and by Yavneh et al. (2001) and Molemaker et al. (2001) in the annular
geometry of the (stratiﬁed) Taylor–Couette ﬂow (see also R¨udiger et al. (2002) and Dubrulle et al. (2005)
for astrophysical applications). For simple geometric reasons, these instabilities occur only for anticyclonic
shears (Λ > 0). Yavneh et al. (2001) and Molemaker et al. (2001) also identiﬁed other modes of instability
in anticyclonic shears. These can be associated with the resonance between Kelvin and inertia-gravity
waves, and between inertia-gravity waves. The ﬁrst mechanism is analogous to the mixed-mode instabilities
examined by Sakai (1989), McWilliams et al. (2004), Molemaker et al. (2005) and Plougonven et al. (2005)
in a variety of contexts. As we show, the second mechanism is also active in cyclonic shears (Λ < 0). Thus,
we establish that the stratiﬁed horizontal Couette ﬂow is unconditionally unstable.

For all the instabilities that we study, the growth rates are exponentially small in ǫ because the resonant
waves with diﬀerently signed wave momentum are localised exponentially in diﬀerent sides of the channel.
We provide both a qualitative description of the instabilities, based on the mode resonance and conservation
laws, and quantitative results, based on the WKB approximation and numerical computations.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The linearized equations of motion governing the

We note that for the shallow-water model with depth H, the subsonic condition analogous to (2.8) is
(gH)1/2 < ΛL and does not involve the wavenumbers (Ripa 1983). It is never satisﬁed for suﬃciently small
Λ and thus, for order-one Burger number, for suﬃciently small ǫ. Thus the shallow-water analogue of our
model is linearly stable in the limit ǫ

3 Normal modes

Let us now consider normal-mode solutions of the linearized equations of motion (2.1)–(2.5). The subsonic
condition (2.8) suggests that the wavenumbers k and m should be rescaled by ǫ. We therefore write the
dependent variables in the form

u(x, y, z, t) = ˆu(y/L) exp

ıǫ−1L−1(kx + mz/s)

f ωt

,

(3.1)

with similar expressions for v, w, p and ρ. Here k, m and ω are dimensionless wavenumbers and frequency,
with their dimensional counterparts given by k/(ǫL), m/(ǫsL) and f ω, respectively. Without loss of gen-
erality we assume that k > 0. Note that the non-dimensionalisation then implies that modes with ω > 0
(ω < 0) propagate to the right (left) in anticyclonic shear and to the left (right) in cyclonic shear.

In terms of the dimensionless k and m, the subsonic condition (2.8) reads

r = (s2k2 + m2)1/2 > 1.

Introducing the normal modes (3.1) into (2.1)–(2.5) leads to a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
for ˆu, ˆv, ˆw, ˆp and ˆρ. These independent variables can be eliminated in favour of ˆp, leading in particular to

point since, as argued in

down in an ǫ2/3 neighbourhood of y−, where it is replaced by an Airy function Ai. In [

The asymptotic results (3.16) and (3.23) provide a ﬁrst approximation to the dispersion relation of KWs

Yavneh et al. (2001), employing a second-order ﬁnite-volume discretization of (B.1)–(B.2). For given physical
parameters and wavenumbers, m and k, we search for eigenfrequencies for which the matrix representing the
discretized system is singular. The codes are implemented in MATLAB, with the search performed using
the fminsearch function that employs the so-called Simplex algorithm.

3.4 Dispersion relation

Figures 2 and 3 show the dispersion relation for anticyclonic and cyclonic ﬂows, respectively. The parameters
have been chosen as ǫ = 0.1, δ = 2 and s = 0.1, but the qualitative features remain the same for a wide range
of values. The numerical results (dotted curves) are compared with the asymptotic estimates (solid curves)
to conﬁrm the validity of the latter. For KWs, we have used an O(ǫ)-accurate estimate which improves on
(3.16) by adding the term ǫc1 =
ǫσ(2r) derived in Appendix C. For IGWs, we have used the estimate
(3.23), corrected in the anticyclonic case by subtracting ǫ/2 from the square bracket. This correction, which
can be viewed as an experimentally determined O(ǫ) term in the expansion of c, is made for the clarity of
the plot: without it, the O(ǫ) error in the dispersion relation is not signiﬁcantly smaller than the O(ǫ2/3)
distance between branches, and it is diﬃcult to relate each asymptotic curve to its numerical counterpart.
No corrections were necessary for the cyclonic shear, suggesting the dispersion relation (3.23) is already
O(ǫ)-accurate in this case. To conﬁrm this would require to continue the asymptotic developments to the
next order in ǫ; this is a daunting task which we have not attempted for IGWs.

∓

Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the multiple intersections between the branches IGW± of the dispersion
relation. In the anticyclonic case, there are additional intersections between the branches KW±, and between
KW± and IGW∓. (The KW do not appear in Figure 3 for the cyclonic case because they have
> 1.) The
intersections, associated with the linear resonance between modes, are generically spurious: they result from
the ﬁnite resolution of the plot for the numerical results, and from the limited accuracy for the asymptotic
ones. There are in fact two possible behaviours: (i) mode conversion, when the phase velocities remaining real
and the two curves, rather than intersecting, locally form the two branches of a hyperbola, or (ii) instability,
when the phase velocities on the two branches become complex conjugate with non-zero imaginary parts.
The two situations are distinguished by the signs of quadratic invariants, such as the wave momentum, along
the colliding branches: (i) mode conversion occurs when both signs are the same, and (ii) instability occurs
when the signs diﬀer (e.g. Cairns 1979). We now show that the latter situation is the relevant one in our

. This establishes the existence
M
of many modes of instability, both for anticyclonic and cyclonic shears. The main diﬀerence between the
diﬀerently signed shears is that instabilities involving KWs only are possible only for anticyclonic shear.

All the instabilities are associated with the interactions of modes exponentially localised on diﬀerent sides
of the channel. Therefore their interaction is exponentially weak and, as a consequence, the growth rates
of the instabilities and range of unstable wavenumbers are exponentially small in ǫ, as anticipated in the
Introduction. As the asymptotic calculations of the next section show, such small growth rates are somewhat
delicate to capture analytically. However, the interpretation in terms of interactions of waves with oppositely
signed ˆ
M

makes it possible to predict instability robustly, without detailed calculations.

Instabilities

4.1 KW-KW instabilities

We start our study of the weak instabilities associated with mode interactions by deriving an estimate
for the growth rate of the instability that arises through the resonance of KWs in anticyclonic shear. This
instability has been examined in some detail by Kushner et al. (1998) and by Yavneh et al. (2001). Because it
is the strongest instability, with physical relevance in Taylor–Couette and accretion discs (see Dubrulle et al.
2005), we present here a complete asymptotic derivation of the growth rate. For the KW-IGW and IGW-
IGW instabilities considered in
4.2–4.3, we limit the derivation to the exponential behaviour of the growth
rate as ǫ
0. The method we now describe could however be applied to these instabilities as well, should a
more accurate estimate be needed.

→

§§

To obtain the growth of the instability, we need to reconsider the dispersion relation (3.13) in the vicinity
of the resonance point, taking into account exponentially small terms. Let c⋆ and r⋆ be the values of r and
c at resonance. By symmetry, c⋆ = 0. According to (3.16) (with σ = 1 corresponding to the anticyclonic
shear),

r = r⋆ = 1 + O(ǫ).

Thus, resonance occurs on an ellipse with semi-axes 1/s and 1 in the (k, m)-plane, and the instability region
is an exponentially small annulus around this ellipse. It is best parameterized using the polar coordinates
(r, θ), with

Now, take

sk = r cos θ

and m = r sin θ.

c = C and r = r⋆ + R,

where C and R are exponentially small. This can be introduced into the dispersion relation (3.13); using the
fact that (c = 0, r = r⋆) satisfy (3.14), a Taylor expansion leaves only terms that are exponentially small. In

Formula (4.4) is the ﬁrst main result of this paper. It provides the leading-order asymptotics for the

Thus, at the crude level of exponential dependence on ǫ, we obtain the estimate

4.2 KW-IGW instabilities

The KW-IGW instabilities occur for anticyclonic ﬂows through the resonance of an IGW, which has one
turning point and is localised on one side of the channel, with a KW localised on the other side. To estimate
their growth rates, we can consider a solution consisting of a linear combination of the IGW− given by
(3.19)–(3.20) which is oscillatory near y =
1, and the KW+ given by (3.12). (The other combination, of
IWG+ with KW−, has the same growth rate, by symmetry.) A calculation similar to that carried out for
KW-KW instabilities could in principle be performed to obtain the leading-order behaviour of the growth
rate. However, this requires the derivation of the IGW dispersion relation accurate to O(ǫ) involving an
inordinate amount of calculation. We shall therefore limit ourselves to the determination of the exponential

behaviour of Im ω (that is, to the determination of the constant Ψ0 such that log Im ω
in the instability regions, and ignore the order-one prefactor in the expression of Im ω. As in the case of
KW-KW instabilities, Ψ0 is determined simply from the amplitude of the colliding modes at the boundary
where they are exponentially small, given explicitly by exp(
Ψ0/ǫ). Note that Ψ0 controls not only the
exponential smallness of the growth rate but also that of the width of the instability bands.

4.3 IGW-IGW instabilities

We now consider the instabilities that result from the resonance between IGWs. These are particularly
important for cyclonic ﬂows since they provide the only mode of instability in this case. In fact, as can be
expected from the leading-order dispersion relation (3.23), the dominant behaviour of these instabilities is
unaﬀected by rotation, so that the exponential dependence on 1/ǫ is identical for anticyclonic and cyclonic
shears. What diﬀers between the two cases, however, is the order-one prefactor which we do not estimate
analytically.

IGW-IGW instabilities occur when a solution p− of the form (3.19)–(3.20) is resonant with its counterpart

p+. The modes have then two turning points y± in the channel, leading to the necessary condition r
≥
(1 + δ2)1/2 for the instability. We now estimate the factor Ψ0 controlling the exponential smallness of the
instability growth rates. As in the previous section, we restrict our attention to the quasi-gesotrophic scaling
s
1 and δ = O(1). We furthermore consider only the strongest IGW, associated with the (symmetric)
resonance of the gravest (n = 1) IGW modes, and for which c = 0 to all orders in ǫ. The resonance condition
is therefore

we successively double the grid resolution until results are unchanged to at least four signiﬁcant digits. This
required grids of sizes ranging from about 250 mesh points for strong or moderate instabilities, to as many
as 16 000 mesh points for very weak instabilities. This may be improved upon by using nonuniform grids
with high resolution only in regions where the solution changes fast. The search for the bands of instabilities
in (k, m) is quite delicate, but made possible by the excelllent approximations aﬀorded by the asymptotic
results.

§

We start by considering the KW-KW instability of anticyclonic ﬂows. Figure 4 shows Im c as a function
of r for θ = π/2 and ǫ = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 in the instability bands. The dots represent numerically computed
values; the solid line are computed analytically using (4.4). Note that we only know r⋆ to algebraic accuracy,
while the bands are exponentially narrow. Hence, we use the numerical results for determining r⋆—the value
of r for which Im c is maximized. The narrowing of the instability band is clearly exhibited in the ﬁgure,
and the small-ǫ analytical approximation quickly converges to the numerical results as ǫ becomes small. The
dependence of Im c on θ is illustrated by Figure 5 which compares numerical and asymptotic estimates for
the maximum value of Im c as a function of θ for s = 0.1 and ǫ = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The value of Im c in the
quasi-geostrophic scaling s
π/2, is also indicated. The Figure conﬁrms
the accuracy of the asymptotic estimate and shows the rapid decrease of Im c as θ decrases from π/2.

to the maximum over m and k for ﬁxed s = 0.1. For KW-KW instabilities, the asymptotic estimates are
obtained from (4.4). For KW-GW and IGW-IGW instabilities, we use (4.11) and (4.13), respectively. These
give Im c only up to a multiplicative constant which we ﬁx by matching the asymptotic and numerical results
shown in the ﬁgure. In the linear-logarithmic coordinates used, the numerical
for the smallest values of
|
points line up with the predicted straight lines for larger
, thus conﬁrming the validity of the asymptotic

analysis. Further support is provided by the fact that the values of k and m for which Im c is maximised
are close to the estimates (4.10) and (4.12). Evidently, the match between the numerical and analytical
results is quite good even for ǫ moderately small. We see that the instabilities become substantial for ǫ
1,
especially KW-KW instabilities. Observe that, as predicted by the analysis, the decay of the growth rate in
IGW-IGW instability as ǫ becomes small is the same for cyclonic and anticyclonic ﬂows, and yet the growth
rates of cyclonic ﬂow are smaller by a factor of about 20. Thus the O(1) prefactor in the asymptotics of
Im c for IGW-IGW instabilities, ignored in (4.13), turns out to be numerically very diﬀerent for anticyclonic
and cyclonic ﬂows. The smallness of this prefactor in the cyclonic case means that the instability remains
exceedingly weak even for ǫ

1, and likely irrelevant in many physical situations.

5 Discussion

This paper examines the linear stability of a horizontal Couette ﬂow of a rapidly rotating, strongly strati-
ﬁed, inviscid ﬂuid. The main conclusion is that the ﬂow is unconditionally unstable: unbalanced instabili-
ties, associated with linear resonances between Kelvin and inertia-gravity waves, occur for arbitrarily small
Rossby numbers ǫ = Λ/f . The growing perturbations have small horizontal and vertical scales, with typical
wavenumbers or spatial-decay rates of the order of ǫ−1. Physically, it is easy to understand why asymp-
totically small scales are a key ingredient of the instabilities. The phase locking between diﬀerent waves
which underlies the instability mechanisms requires the wave phase speed to be comparable to the basic ﬂow

17

velocity, and this only occurs for small-scale waves. The need for small vertical scales also explains why
the instabilities examined in this paper have no direct counterparts in shallow-water ﬂows; these are stable
for small enough
because of the inherent limitation in vertical structure imposed by the shallow-water
approximation.

ǫ

Our conclusion that the rotating stratiﬁed Couette ﬂow is always unstable is of course in sharp contrast
with the one that may be drawn from balanced models. Regardless of their accuracy, which can be any
power ǫn, they predict the stability of ﬂows without inﬂection points such as the Couette ﬂow. There is no
contradiction, however, since the growth rates found for the unbalanced instabilities are exponentially small
is
. In practice, this exponential dependence means that the instabilities are exceedingly weak when
in
|
small, but can become important rather suddenly as
increases towards 1 and beyond. If the instabilities
ǫ
|
are to play a signiﬁcant role in the breakdown of balance in geophysical ﬂows, this will therefore be in a
manner that is extremely sensitive to the Rossby number.

In the literature, most attention has been paid to anticyclonic ﬂows, and in particular to the coupled
Kelvin-wave instability occuring in these ﬂows. Our results clarify that cyclonic ﬂows are also unstable,
through an instability mechanism involving coupled inertia-gravity waves. This mechanism is also active
in anticyclonic ﬂows where, along with the instability mode mixing Kelvin and inertia-gravity waves, it
provides an alternative to the well studied instability due to Kelvin-wave resonance (see Yavneh et al. 2001,
Molemaker et al. 2001). The focus on anticyclonic ﬂows and Kelvin-wave instabilities is justiﬁed in practice
by the fact that the associated growth rate is much larger than those of the other instability mechanisms,
exponentially larger in fact in the limit ǫ
0. The instability of the cyclonic ﬂows is especially weak. This
weakness is not completely accounted for by the exponential dependence on 1/ǫ, since this is the same for
both anticyclonic and cyclonic ﬂows whilst the growth rates obtained numerically are very diﬀerent. We
conclude, then, that the exponential dependence and the O(1) prefactor conspire to make the instability of
.
cyclonic ﬂows extremely weak, even for moderate
|

The WKB approach used in this paper could be extended to examine the instability in more general
rotating stratiﬁed shear ﬂows. Obvious applications are the stratiﬁed Taylor–Couette ﬂow (Yavneh et al.
2001, Molemaker et al. 2001), which diﬀers from the problem studied here by the presence of curvature terms,
and the stability of accretion discs (R¨udiger et al. 2002, Dubrulle et al. 2005). Additional physical eﬀects
that it would be of interest to study include diﬀerent boundary conditions (in particular the case of inﬁnite
domains for which no Kelvin waves exist), viscous and thermal damping, and non-zero potential-vorticity
gradients, leading to the existence of critical levels for neutral modes (cf. Balmforth 1996).

C Kelvin-wave dispersion relation

In this Appendix, we derive the dispersion relation for KWs accurate to O(ǫ), as is necessary to obtain the
leading-order asymptotics of the KW-instability growth rate.

The dispersion relation for KW± valid to all orders in ǫ are given in (3.14). It is solved at leading order
3.2 to give (3.16). At the next order, we ﬁnd the two equations
